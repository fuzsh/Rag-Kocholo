        "text": "I Will Be Ready for That\n\nHow much time, effort, and money have you put into emergency readiness? In other words, do you have a blanket, flashlight, and prepackaged food in your vehicle in case you break down somewhere? Do you have dried food, a barrel of iodine infused water, and antibiotics stored in your basement or pantry? How prepared are…\n\nRead more\n\nActs 16\n\nThis article is a devotional on Acts 16. The verse references are from Acts 16. In Chapter 15, Paul and Barnabas have a disagreement, and they end up parting ways. Paul ends up taking Silas and departing on Paul’s second missionary journey and goes back to Derbe and Lystra, where Paul had been stoned on…\n\nRead more\n\n“[The Slave], One of You”\n\nSocial Status in Colossians, a Snapshot In ancient Rome, slavery dominated. The NET Bible says that slaves comprised an estimated 10–20% of the population in the first century A.D.1 and were considered “’property’ in every sense of the word.”2 It’s in this context that Paul the Apostle writes final greetings to the church of Colossae…\n\nRead more\n\nEncouragement for You\n\nIn quiet moments of prayer and meditation, do you ever contemplate if Yahweh has a work for you to do? That task can be for that morning or over a long period of time. We may be inspired toward one thought, and it may not work out as we plan. For us to be able…\n\nRead more\n\nRevelation 17\n\nThroughout history, sexual immorality, greed, and covetousness strongly motivated the people of the world. Satan has used these unholy desires “to make the world go round”. The last world empire immediately preceding Christ’s return will function likewise only more vigorously than ever before so as to deceive all the world leaders and all the people…\n\nRead more\n\nHow Does That Work?\n\nWhen we are kids, we all have questions. We ask, “Why is the sky blue?” “How long is an hour?” and “Why can’t I stay up later?” As we age, our curiosity about the world slowly fades. We learn pat answers and move on with life. Not the investigator. This personality type needs to know.…\n\nRead more\n\nActs 13\n\nAs a pastor, I try my best to get out and visit the sick and elderly. I feel a tension when visiting an elderly or really sick person. This tension is I want to pray for their healing, but I also acknowledge that everyone I know will probably die. I have had people in my…\n\nRead more\n\nBe a Barnabas\n\nLessons From a Future Apostle’s Advocate The Apostle Paul didn’t come fully formed. Before he even went by the name Paul, a cast of characters taught him, mentored him, saw potential in him, and put him in positions of responsibility. Initially, one person acted decisively to elevate and include him: Barnabas. Acts chapter 9 details…\n\nRead more\n\nWhere Does Fruit Come From? Part 2\n\nIn a previous article (Glad Tidings, July/August 2022), we were discussing fruit in our lives as delineated in Galatians 6:22-23. The metaphor of fruit as being good attributes we have when we allow the spirit of God to work within us shows us the need for connection to Yahweh through Jesus Christ. The sap coming…\n\nRead more\n\nSpiritual Markers\n\nSamuel the prophet told Israel: 1 Samuel 7:3. “If you return to Yahweh with all your heart, remove the foreign gods and the Ashtaroth from among you and direct your hearts to Yahweh and serve Him alone; and He will deliver you from the hand of the Philistines.” They followed his direction and eliminated the…\n\nRead more\n\nHow Can I Be Unique?\n\nThe advent of social media and influencers has increased our society’s tendency to conform everyone to a single way of thinking, dressing, and living. Most of us do not question our received mores and habits. We just go with the flow, hoping to look cool or at least not stick out too much. Everyone is…\n\nRead more\n\nThe Downfall of King Saul\n\nAbout 400 years after Israel left Egypt and settled in the land that God had promised His people, the nation was ruled by God’s appointed judges. The last judge, Samuel, was also a prophet. Samuel judged Israel successfully and faithfully all the days of his life. When he grew old and his sons started to…\n\nRead more\n\nBrood of Vipers!\n\nGod Does Not Cancel, He Calls Cancel culture is one “in which [people] gain prestige for identifying small offenses…, and then publicly ‘calling out’ the offenders.… Call-out culture … award[s] status to people who shame or punish alleged offenders.”1 In twenty-first century America, cancel culture (or call-out culture) does not punish crimes, but words and…\n\nRead more\n\nWhere Does Fruit Come From? Part One\n\nOne sure way to decide whether Jesus Christ is Lord in a life is to examine the evidence of everyday character. We can ask ourselves: Am I peaceful? Am I patient? Am I loving? These and many more qualities describe attitudes that motivate our actions. We can wash dishes that have accumulated in the sink…\n\nRead more\n\nChrist the King\n\nWhat do you think when you hear or read the words “Christ” or its equivalent, “Messiah”? “Christ” is from the Greek Christos, and “Messiah” is from the Hebrew Mashiach. Both words mean anointed. The three significant anointings in the OT where the prophet, priest, and king. Jesus, the Son of God, was the unique one…\n\nRead more\n\nCount It All Joy\n\nWith God, Struggles Make Strength Fire is destructive. Particularly in a desert, it poses a threat to vegetation, crops, and animals in all directions. So, when Moses, herding his father-in-law’s sheep, saw a flaming, undamaged bush, he was as surprised as you or I would be. The message God gave Moses from the bush is…\n\nRead more\n\nLove and Forgiveness\n\nSin has been, is now, and will be a consistent problem for humankind until Jesus Christ returns. The sin of Adam was passed to us all (Genesis 3). From the time of Adam until the resurrection of Jesus, the full sharing and communion with Yahweh was lost. Yahweh is a righteous and holy God and…\n\nRead more\n\nJesus Sympathizes With You\n\nThe physical pain Jesus suffered is beyond my comprehension as are the negative emotions he navigated through all without sinning. He is the example of how to endure difficulties without compromising our faith. 1 Peter 2:21-23. For you have been called for this purpose, since Christ also suffered for you, leaving you an example for…\n\nRead more\n\nHow Can I Be Awesome?\n\nAre you an achiever? Do you get a little burst of joy each time you accomplish a task, no matter how small? Do you take pride in your hard-earned accomplishments? Are you eager to share your accomplishments when you first meet someone? Are you driven to be the best? If you answered, “Yes,” to these…\n\nRead more\n\nEvangelism and How Not to Pray\n\nThe rush and thrill of evangelism is a pleasure which far too few Christians avail themselves. Nonetheless, Jesus was emphatic: his followers were to go and preach the Good News as a witness in all the inhabited earth. And despite the best of intentions, who can say sharing the message of Christ--his sacrificial death and…\n\nRead more\n\nGod Can Do So Much With So Little\n\nWhat’s your favorite “Jesus story”? I once heard a Bible teacher ask us this question—to think about our favorite gospel story of Jesus. He asked us to consider—of all the amazing things Jesus did and said, if one or two records had a special impact or was particularly enjoyable. He suggested pondering this to gain…\n\nRead more\n\nAll the Time in the World\n\nLiving on an Eternal Schedule Time is valuable, and the way we speak about it reflects that attitude. In American culture, we don’t just say, “time is money.” We refer to time like a precious resource: we talk about “wasting” time, “spending” time, “saving” time, and “making” time. In my most generous moments, I tell…\n\nRead more\n\nWe Need Both: Supernatural Wisdom & Experiences\n\nThe first century church, as recorded in the book of Acts, follows the incredible events of the Gospels. During the Gospels, Jesus was preaching the good news of the Kingdom of God and healing thousands of people by great miracles. There were minimally 5,000 at one time healed, delivered, and fed (Matthew 6:8-10). Lazarus and…\n\nRead more\n\nThe Religious Effect of Asceticism\n\nConfidence before God 1 John 3:21-22. Beloved, if our heart does not condemn us, we have confidence before God; and whatever we ask we receive from Him, because we keep His commandments and do the things that are pleasing in His sight. If our heart condemns us, we will not have confidence before God. Some…\n\nRead more\n\nCan I Help You?\n\nAre you a helper? Do you automatically size up a situation and find a way to plug yourself in? Are you the type of person who regularly finds yourself staying late to clean up after a party? Are you attuned to others’ needs and emotions? Are you a great listener, for whom relationships and giving…\n\nRead more\n\nHagar, the Heeded Victim\n\nGod’s empowering response to a slave’s suffering The lives of the patriarchs, storied and famous, are not without casualties. These imperfect humans who would go on to sire the children of Israel lied to, cheated, failed, and, by modern standards, abused others. But it’s here that God invites us to look with Him on the…\n\nRead more\n\nMinding Your Thoughts\n\nIsaiah 26:3-4. You [Yahweh] keep him in perfect peace whose mind is stayed on you, because he trusts in you. Trust in Yahweh forever, for Yahweh God is an everlasting rock. It is difficult to keep our peace when trials slam us from every side—like finances, viruses, family issues, work, and co-workers to name a…\n\nRead more\n\nMercy and Healing\n\nGod’s mercy is evident throughout the Scriptures, starting immediately after the fall of Adam and Eve when He set in motion His plan for humanity’s redemption. Genesis 3:15 holds the first prophecy about the Messiah and what he would accomplish for our salvation. The first time the word “merciful” occurs in the Bible is when…\n\nRead more\n\nWhat If I’m Wrong?\n\nMost of us are probably too scared to ask this question, especially about the big questions of life. We might be able to admit we are wrong about picking a car mechanic, forgetting to bring an umbrella, or choosing something off the menu at a restaurant. But how many of us are willing to ask…\n\nRead more\n\n“All Things Come from You,”\n\nMistaking the Miraculous for the Mundane This summer, in a shocking whirlwind of events, I was diagnosed with cancer. A massive tumor had invaded my abdomen, filling my insides with its insidious, disturbing growth as it destroyed one of my ovaries. Anyone would plead with God to deliver him/her, and I did. I remember lying…\n\nRead more\n\nBy What Power?\n\nProverbs 2:3-5. If you call out for insight and raise your voice for understanding, if you seek it like silver and search for it as for hidden treasures, Then you will understand the fear of the LORD and find the knowledge of God. How do you in this new covenant age receive knowledge from God?…\n\nRead more\n\nSupernatural Christianity\n\nJohn 8:31-32, 36. So Jesus was saying to those Jews who had believed Him, “If you continue in My word, then you are truly disciples of Mine; and you will know the truth, and the truth will make you free.” “So, if the Son makes you free, you will be free indeed. If you have…\n\nRead more\n\nEight Attributes of God\n\nWhen I went to Bible college, I had a professor (Dr. Joe Martin) who was obsessed with the eight attributes of God. It didn’t matter which class he was teaching. We knew we were going to see a question on the final exam that asked us to list out the eight attributes. After a decade…\n\nRead more\n\nBetter Than Children: God’s Heart for Society’s Outsiders\n\nIsaiah draws concentric circles around the Kingdom. Written by an Israelite seer in a time of great national distress, the book offers warning, encouragement, judgment, and prophecy about both the circumstances of his time and the coming Messianic Kingdom. As in all books of the Bible, God’s love is there—if we are looking. And in…\n\nRead more\n\nTime Periods in the Bible: Why We Need the OT for the Epistles\n\nEditor’s Note: For more information on this important topic, please see Echoes of Scripture in the Letters of Paul by Richard Hays and Commentary on the New Testament Use of the Old Testament by Beale and Carson. In the previous article, we saw that the Gospels are generally applicable to the modern Christian. In this…\n\nRead more\n\nHold Fast to the End\n\nIn uncertain times, we may think that we know the will of Yahweh but, due to circumstances, may waver in our faith. Our faith might falter because life is generally not linear; life may take many twists and turns. We start out with great commitment, and then as different situations arise, we may wane in…\n\nRead more\n\nHealing Is an Aspect of Salvation\n\nIsaiah 53 is the great chapter in the OT that foretells God’s plan of salvation through Jesus Christ. Former prophecies of the Messiah and the message of salvation were presented in veiled form. But here, for the first time, it is set forth with magnificent clarity. The prophecy was written in the past tense as…\n\nRead more\n\nIs God Greater Than Jesus?\n\nMost Christians believe God and His Son have an equality of essence. However, when we ask what “essence” refers to, proponents of this view typically tell us that such mysteries are beyond our comprehension. If we ask logical questions like, “How can one who died for our sins be equal to one who cannot die?”…\n\nRead more\n\nWho Were the Samaritans?\n\nIn the Gospel of John, Jesus, on his way to Galilee from Jerusalem, encountered a Samaritan woman at a well. There she asks him an unusual question, “How can you being a Jew ask me for a drink when the Jews have no dealings with the Samaritans?” (John 4:3-7). The Samaritans are mentioned in the…\n\nRead more\n\nTime Periods in the Bible: How Should We Read the Gospels?\n\nAs I mentioned in the last article on time periods, there are many things from the Gospels that are directly applicable to the modern-day Christian. Much of Jesus’ teaching ministry focused on how the disciples should act and walk with God after he was gone.
