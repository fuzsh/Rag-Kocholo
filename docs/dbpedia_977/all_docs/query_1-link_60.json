Rookie reporter Emma Collins hates fruitcake; for that matter, she hates Christmas, too. When three Washington State women are finalists in a national fruitcake contest, the story is assigned to her. That's bad enough. It gets worse when she has to fly in a small plane (scary ) with a smart-aleck pilot named Oliver Hamilton (sexy ) and his scruffy dog (cute ). In the end she meets three wise women, falls in love and learns There's Something About Christmas. This is also a time for families, for togetherness, for memories. On Christmas Eve, Maryanne and Nolan Adams tell their kids the story they most want to hear--how Mom and Dad met and fell in love. It all started when they were reporters on rival Seattle papers...and next thing you know, Here Comes Trouble\n\nTitle: GLAD TIDINGS:THERE'S SOMETHING ABOUT CHRISTMAS HERE COMES TROUBLE\n\nAuthor Name: MACOMBER, DEBBIE\n\nISBN Number: 0778313956\n\nISBN-13: 9780778313953\n\nLocation Published: HARLEQUIN MIRA\n\nBinding: Paperback\n\nBook Condition: GOOD\n\nCategories: Romance\n\nSeller ID: 257650"
