        "text": "Noel! Noel! Noel! Noel!\n\nBorn is the King of Israel!\n\nAs often as it appears in cards, plaques, and Christmas carols, the little word “Noel” evades precise definition. The old English Christmas shout “Nowell” can be traced back to the French form “Noel,” and from there the etymological road splits. On one hand, “Noel” could be derived from the Latin natalis, meaning “born”—thus, “He is born!” The second possibility, however, and the one that intrigues me more, links “Noel” with the French word nouvelle, meaning “news.” Rather than the direct statement “He is born,” then, “Noel” takes on a broader meaning: “Good news!”\n\nThis year, “good news” has become a recurring theme in many of my experiences. From enjoying the robust psalm-singing of the Reformed Presbyterian Church I attend at college, to singing with The Genevans Choir first in Ohio and then in southeast Asia, to hosting Geneva’s small vocal ensemble New Song at my home church, to participating in a TASC (Teens Actively Serving Christ) trip on Long Island, to preparing organ and choir music for The Genevans’ Christmas concerts this fall, the year 2014 left me both with a deeper understanding of what that “good news” means and with a more vigorous joy to proclaim it.\n\nThe good news, of course, is that God has provided a way for sinners to be reconciled to himself, through the birth, death, resurrection, and ascension of his Son Jesus Christ. But the ramifications of that statement—on either an individual or a global level—are hard to process for minds and hearts as thick as mine.\n\nJust before the end of the spring semester, The Genevans sang for a wedding in the architecturally overwhelming Heinz Chapel in Pittsburgh. Three weeks later, we were visiting a chapel in rural Mindanao with one wall and a dirt floor. I got to sing psalms in locations as disparate as the summit of 13,435-foot Mount Kinabalu and the cavernous tower of a Long Island lighthouse. The choir’s Christmas concerts drew a full house at Beaver Falls’s magnificent First Presbyterian Church, but our audiences in the Philippines sometimes consisted only of a few villagers and a dog. Yet almost anywhere we visited, there were signs that the good news of the gospel had been there.\n\nIn places like Heinz Chapel, the gospel has become so commonplace—so un-extraordinary—that the colossal building may represent nothing but a shell of once-vibrant faith. In other places, the physical amenities may be meager, but the good news has brought true hope and real transformation, incorporating new “living stones” into the spiritual edifice of the Church universal (I Peter 2:5). For me, some of the most powerful evidence of the gospel’s work emerged from the fellowship I enjoyed with Christian brothers and sisters in the congregations we visited, whether stateside or around the globe. What a wonder it is to belong to “one body and one Spirit” (Ephesians 4)!\n\nPsalm 98 expresses the joy of these “glad tidings” better than any human tongue can:\n\nOh sing to the LORD a new song,\n\nfor he has done marvelous things!\n\nHis right hand and his holy arm\n\nhave worked salvation for him.\n\nThe LORD has made known his salvation;\n\nhe has revealed his righteousness in the sight of the nations. . . .\n\nAll the ends of the earth have seen\n\nthe salvation of our God.\n\n–Psalm 98:1,3 (ESV)\n\nPerhaps the psalmist penned these words with ardent longing for the day when God’s salvation would be revealed to the nations as never before, when his “steadfast love and faithfulness” to his people would be remembered and the earth’s ends would see his redeeming work. That would be good news indeed—but it would be long in coming.\n\nThe angels’ first words to the shepherds in Luke 2—“Fear not . . . I bring you good news of great joy that will be for all the people . . .”—marked the beginning of the best announcement this tired world could hope to see. Christ has come! He has come, as he promised through Isaiah,\n\nto bring good news to the poor;\n\nhe has sent me to bind up the brokenhearted,\n\nto proclaim liberty to the captives,\n\nand the opening of the prison to those who are bound;\n\nto proclaim the year of the Lord’s favor,\n\nand the day of vengeance of our God;\n\nto comfort all who mourn;\n\nto grant to those who mourn in Zion—\n\nto give them a beautiful headdress instead of ashes,\n\nthe oil of gladness instead of mourning,\n\nthe garment of praise instead of a faint spirit;\n\nthat they may be called oaks of righteousness,\n\nthe planting of the Lord, that he may be glorified.\n\n–Isaiah 61:1-3\n\nIn the last few weeks of the fall semester I put together the following video (with footage from several of the sites we visited this year and audio from Geneva’s campus chimes and the First Presbyterian Church pipe organ) in an attempt to connect as many of these themes as possible—“The First Noel,” the good news of Christ’s coming, and the spread of the gospel to the ends of the earth.\n\n[youtube http://youtu.be/5c2u1Q9d5rM]\n\nMay this season offer you the opportunity to see the Lord’s salvation, to rejoice in his righteousness, to know his steadfast love, and to “sing to the Lord a new song.” Truly he has done marvelous things.\n\n–MRK"
