        "text": "Using the music industry to spread the anti-India narrative is not a new thing for Khalistanis. YouTube, Spotify and Instagram have become tools for these separatists to propagate their fanatic ideology via songs.\n\nIn recent years, pro-Khalistani Punjabi singers and artists based in western nations are using lyrics and rap music to influence young minds towards their propaganda.\n\nThese Khalistani singers have flourished their careers with a series of anti-government and anti-reform songs based almost entirely on sectarian supremacy. The lyrics play around with the idea that disregards the sovereignty of Jammu & Kashmir, North-East and India.\n\nNowadays, Punjabi songs are weaponised with lyrics used to fuel anger against Modi, ‘Dilli’ and ‘Kashmir’ in general; it is to be noted that their motive is only to gain pro-Khalistan sentiments among the listeners. The Modi Government needs to crack down on this nexus and decimate its financers immediately.\n\nAmid the ongoing search operation of fugitive Amritpal Singh and his associates by the Punjab police and Central agencies, another drama unfolded on March 21 as Canada based-Punjabi singer Shubh shared distorted India’s map with Punjab coloured separately, Jammu and Kashmir, North-East region was also removed from the map.\n\nHaryana & Himachal Pradesh was coloured with the same colour and was included in Punjab (just like the Khalistan map). Separating the Punjab and J&K from India is the common ideology of Khalistanis and Pakistanis.\n\nBollywood actress Kangana Ranaut also shared the offensive remark by Elevated fame Shubh against India\n\nKangana Ranaut wrote, “Many Punjabi celebrities are infected with the virus of Khalistani disease. Beheading India on its map should have serious consequences. The Government of India must make strong laws against such criminals. Fill a proper answer to Khalistan in their heads by locking them in jail. That is the way to do fill in the blanks with them all.”\n\nShubh is a Punjabi rapper and singer who lives in Brampton, Canada. Shubh’s full name is Shubhjit Singh. Shubh is a relative of Punjabi singer, anchor, and actor Ravneet Singh. Ravneet Singh hosts a youth show, ‘Canteeni Mandeer,’ which is telecasted on the MH1 Channel.\n\n‘Daku’ song by Inderpal Moga and Chani Nattan showcases Khalistani leader Jarnail Singh Bhindrawale, in which can be heard saying, “I’m a Daku, and I accept this I’m a Daku”.\n\nLate singer Sidhu Moosewala in one of his songs titled “Punjab (Motherland)” released in the year 2020, also hailed Khalistani leader Jarnail Singh Bhindranwale and his aides. The beginning of the song is followed by old footage of Bhindranwale along with his aides walking with controversial lyrics as follows: “Keh Keh K Badle Lainda, Mainu Punjab Kehande aa, Delhi Vee Nap Lainda, Mainu Punjab Kehande aa”.\n\nNotably, Moosewala’s posthumous song ‘Sutlej-Yamuna Link canal’ was also banned in India due to controversial lyrics. The song was considered controversial as issues ranging from the killing of former Prime Minister Indira Gandhi were taken up in the video. The song claimed that there is no water to be shared with any other state and demanded the return of Haryana, Himachal Pradesh, and Chandigarh to it.\n\nThe song also hailed the pro-Khalistani leader of Babbar Khalsa Balwinder Singh Jattana.\n\nCanada-based Punjabi Singer Jazzy B, who is currently residing in the UK, in his song “Putt Sardara De” also glorified Khalistani leader Jarnail Singh Bhindranwale, supports the demand for a separate Khalistan nation for Sikhs. The song is written by Amrit Bova.\n\nThe lyrics suggested that Sikhs deserve Khalistan, and Sikhs know how to take revenge for what happened to their community in India. There is also a clip showing a speech by Bhindranwale in the song.\n\nAlso Read: https://organiser.org/2023/02/24/99089/bharat/punjab/amritpal-singh-new-face-of-sponsored-extremism/\n\nEarlier, in November-December 2020, Punjabi singer Kaur B also posted a distorted image of the Indian map. The same image was used by leading Punjabi actor Neeru Bajwa. However, this was not the first time Kaur B had posted a provocative tweet. She has been tweeting in support of Khalistani leader Jarnail Singh Bhindranwale during the farmer’s agitation.\n\nDiljit Dosanjh is also known for being a pro-Khalistani. In June 2020, a demand for an FIR against Diljit Dosanjh was raised after he was seen supporting Gurpatwant Pannu’s and Sikhs for Justice (SFJ) demand for Khalistan. Ludhiana MP Ravneet Singh Bittu had urged then Chief Minister Captain Amarinder Singh to order that FIRs be filed in every police station of the state against singer Diljit Dosanjh.\n\nPollywood and Pakistani artists\n\nThere is no doubt that the term Khalistan was derived from Pakistan and ISI. ISI has instigated overseas Khalistan supporters to organise protests and demonstrations abroad, including in London, San Francisco and various cities in Canada, as part of its plan to disturb peace in India.\n\nAt a time when Pakistani Actors, Singers and Cricketers are not allowed to work in India, Pakistani actors are openly working in Punjabi movies without any obstruction.\n\nPakistani actors Iftikhar Thakur, Nasir Chinyoti and Akram Udas worked in Chal Mera Putt, an Indian Punjabi-language comedy-drama film directed by Janjot Singh, with sequel Chal Mera Putt 2 and Chal Mera Putt 3. The film is produced by Karaj Gill under Rhythm Boyz Entertainment and by Ashu Munish Sahni under Omjee Star Studios. It stars Amrinder Gill and Simi Chahal in lead roles.\n\nAnother Pakistani actor Zafri Khan worked in the Punjabi film ‘Aaja Mexico Challiye’ with Ammy Virk acting in the lead role. Nasir Chinyoti was also a part of the film, and Zafri Khan also worked in Chal Mera Putt 2 and Chal Mera Putt 3.\n\nIftikhar Thakur also worked in the film Paani Ch Madhaani with Gippy Grewal and Neeru Bajwa in the lead.\n\nNasir Chinyoti also worked in the film Honeymoon, directed by Amar Preet Chhabra. The film is produced by Bhushan Kumar, Harman Baweja, Krishan Kumar and Vicky Bahri. The film stars Gippy Grewal, Jasmin Bhasin, and Karamjit Anmol in leading roles.\n\nAccording to reports, Nasir Chinyoti is also a part of ‘Carry On Jatta 3’. Carry On Jatta 3 is an upcoming Indian Punjabi-language comedy film directed by Smeep Kang and produced by Humble Motion Pictures. It is a sequel to Carry On Jatta 2 and Carry on Jatta with Gippy Grewal in the lead. The film is scheduled to be on June 29, 2023.\n\nIn a photo doing rounds on social media, actor and producer Gippy Grewal can be seen sitting with khalistani separatist leader Avtar Singh Khanda.\n\nIt is to be noted that the UK-based asylum seeker, ‘Avtar Singh Khanda’, has been arrested for pulling down Indian Flag at Embassy in London, United Kingdom, on March 19. His father ‘Kulwant Singh Khukrana’ was a terrorist of the ‘Khalistan Liberation Force’.\n\nAvtar Singh Khanda is an ISI-linked terrorist, who the Indian intelligence agencies in the past have accused of providing IED training inside the UK Gurudwaras.\n\nAlso Read: https://organiser.org/2023/03/21/165691/bharat/son-of-klf-terrorist-isi-linked-avtar-singh-khanda-arrested-for-pulling-down-indian-flag-at-embassy-in-london/\n\nAmritpal Singh is also believed to be a close associate of UK-based Khalistani terrorist Avtar Singh Khanda. Khanda is a trusted lieutenant of Paramjit Singh Pamma, the leader of the banned Babbar Khalsa International.\n\nAccording to reports, the Khalistani terrorist Avtar Singh Khanda trained Amritpal Singh for ‘Mission Khalistan’. Khanda has a direct connection with Pamma, the leader of the banned Babbar Khalsa International. Together these three conspired to push Punjab towards terrorism once again.\n\nSince Pakistani actors are not allowed in India for shooting, the makers of these films went to UK or Canada for shooting.\n\nNotably, the All Indian Cine Workers Association announced a total ban on Pakistani artists from working in India after the deadly terror attack in Pulwama in Jammu and Kashmir in February 2019 in which 40 jawans of the Central Reserve Police Force (CRPF) were killed by Pakistani terrorists.\n\nObliging the ban, the Indian film fraternity has also shown solidarity by not working with Pakistani actors and singers in Indian films.\n\nRaees in 2017, featuring Mahira Khan opposite Shah Rukh, was the Bollywood movie to feature someone from Pakistan.\n\nIn a recent podcast, Pakistan YouTuber Nadir Ali held a discussion with film actor Javed Shaikh, who played the role of Shah Rukh Khan’s father in Om Shaanti Om, expressed his desperation to work in India, and prayed for Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s loss in the 2024 General Assembly Elections so that his path could be cleared to work in India.\n\nRecently, former pro-Khalistan leader and founder of Dal Khalsa Jaswant Singh Thakedar said the Khalistan referendum campaign being organised in a few western countries is a doing of ‘Pakistan’s ISI’, and it has nothing to do with Sikhs in India. He added that ‘some Sikhs are working as tools’ for the Pakistan government.\n\nPro-Khalistan leader Simranjit Singh Mann who last year won a by-poll election from the Sangrur Lok Sabha constituency, also gave credit for his victory to Khalistani extremist Jarnail Singh Bhindranwale.\n\nCurrently, according to an estimate, around 100 channels on YouTube are streaming songs with anti-India narratives. Some also have millions of subscribers. The need of the hour for the Indian Government is to look into the matter and ban these channels and these fanatic singers with millions of followers who influence youth.\n\nEver since the Khalistan movement was revived with support from foreign soil, the territorial ambitions of Khalistan included Chandigarh, Himachal, Haryana, and Indian Punjab but never the part of Punjab that is in Pakistan like Lahore, Multan, Jhang.\n\nAccording to Jagjit Singh Chohan (founder of the Khalistan Movement), Former Pakistan PM Zulfikar Ali Bhutto had proposed all-out help to create Khalistan during his talks with Chohan following the creation of Bangladesh in 1971.\n\nThe Khalistan movement is outlawed in India and considered a grave national security threat by the Government – a number of groups associated with the movement are listed as “terrorist organisations” under India’s Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act. But it continues to evoke sympathy from some Sikhs, particularly those based in Canada, UK and USA."
