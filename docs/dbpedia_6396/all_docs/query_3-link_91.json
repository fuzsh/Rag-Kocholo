        "text": "It doesnt have to be in C#, but that is the common tuning for the sitar.\n\nIt is all relative to whatever Sa you use.\n\nI tune my sitar to 30 cents below D.\n\nIt just sounds best on my sitar.\n\nThe Sa (Root) in Indian Classical Music is relative to the instrument or what it is tuned to.\n\nIt doesnt really matter what Sa you start from.\n\nYou could play in C, or A, or G, or any root note.\n\nUsually the instrument is based in a root Sa, with strings tuned to Sa or Pa.\n\nOn a sitar, the main strings are either the root of fifth, except the top string that you play most of the melodies on, which is tuned to Ma (4th).\n\nI believe most mandolinists in ICM are tuned root, 5th, root, 5th. (Sa Pa Sa Pa)\n\nAs for the notation example:\n\nThe straight line under a note denotes a flattened note.\n\nIn that example, Bhimpalasi has a flattened 3rd (Ga), and flattened 7th (Ni)\n\nThe dot underneath or above, denotes the octave.\n\nSa with a dot above is the octave above, and dot below is an octave below.\n\nA double dot would be two octaves above or below the Sa\n\nI apologize, as I realize my previous posts were frustratingly unhelpful to your quest.\n\nI was explaining why it was difficult to adapt mandolin to ICM, but didnt answer the question.\n\nOne book that is useful for a comfortable overview of Indian Classical Music and Raga is My Music My Life by Pandit Ravi Shankar. The book is really beautiful. The first half is about his life and the world of Indian Classical music, with beautiful pictures. The second half of the book is an overview of Raga, including explanations, exercises, Gat compositions, Trans, Ornaments, etc. I think they have Indian Sargam notation as well as western notation. It is made for sitar, but can be adapted to any Sa, on any instrument. It is a good read and a useful entry point into the music.\n\nhttps://www.amazon.com/My-Music-Life.../dp/1601090056\n\nAnother great book for a more in depth start into this music is Ali Akbar Khans Book.\n\nClassical Music of North India, the First Years of Study: The Music of the Baba Allauddin Gharana As Taught by Ali Akbar Khan at the Ali Akbar College of Music\n\nhttps://www.amazon.com/Classical-Mus.../dp/812150872X\n\nYou can actually take Skype lessons at the Ali Akbar College of Music in San Rafael.\n\nYou can watch group classes and talk to the teacher, or I believe you can take private lessons.\n\nThey will teach you on whatever instrument you play.\n\nhttp://www.aacm.org/online_classes.html\n\nThe truth is that it doesnt really matter what instrument you play.\n\nAn Indian musician can teach you to play raga even if they dont play your instrument.\n\nThey just teach you Raga by singing it or playing it, and you follow and adapt it to your instrument. Baba Allauddin Khan was the teacher of Ravi Shankar and Ali Akbar Khan, as well as many other musicians on a wide variety of instruments.\n\nThe reason Ravi Shankar style is different from other sitarists is because Allauddin Khan was a Rudra Veena player and a Supremely skilled Sarod player. The style he taught Ravi Shankar was deeply rooted in the Rudra Veena and Drupad.\n\nI can send you more from that book i did the notation for, but I think these other books are highly polished and are excellent.\n\nIt is very interesting to study these musics, but they are VAST subjects, and are much less accessible than learning to play western music. ICM requires years of dedicated Riyaz (practice).\n\nFor me, playing the sitar is truly a passion for that instrument and the music, BUT I never expect to be very good, certainly not good enough to play Classical Raga publicly as a performer. It really does take many years of constant practice to be any good. I go in waves. For a few years I get really into it and practice a couple hours a day, but then I will fail in the dedication and go light on it for a while. It is very very hard to keep up the rigorous practice needed for ICM. I try, but often fail to keep it up. And it aint like riding a bike. You have to keep it up.\n\nIndian music is a very free music in terms of its improvisational nature, BUT that improvisation is contained an a very very strict confines of a Ragas structure and rules. Each raga is a deep ocean of information that needs to be absorbed from a teacher, and from listening to performances of each raga from many great musicians.\n\nI listen to a bunch of different musicians playing the raga I am learning.\n\nI listen to Vocal performances first, as that is the root of Indian music.\n\nMost indian instruments developed from the desire to simulate the qualities of a Vocal performance. Sitar bends the notes to allow vocal lines, and Sarod has a fretless neck allowing sliding from note to note for similar effect.\n\nThen I will listen to my favorite sitarist versions.\n\nThen any great Sarod performances of that Raga.\n\nThen I go for anything I can find. Could be Rudra Veena, bansuri, Saranghi, etc.\n\nIt is a seductive genre, but it is a difficult process.\n\nI encourage the exploration of it.\n\nWhen I got a sense of the depth of what I would have to learn, it scared me much more than when I started looking into the depths of heavy BeBop Jazz. It is just so vast and complicated.\n\nIt certainly is satisfying though when you start to get it, even if it is just for one Raga.\n\nCheck out those books.\n\nAnd Start with Raga Yaman.\n\nIt happens to a lot of people.\n\nThey go to india and buy a sitar, which looks cool, but is a fairly pedestrian market sitar.\n\nMost sitars readily available in india are less than ideal.\n\nEven the known stores keep the good stuff in the back for Indian performers.\n\nThe tourists are sold common instruments.\n\nThen again, sometimes these market sitars are OK to start on.\n\nThey just tend to not have very much volume or sustain.\n\nSometimes a good jawari bridge carving can help make them a lot better.\n\nLike with a mandolin, a good setup is everything.\n\nOn a sitar the carving of a bridge is an art form in itself.\n\nThere are only a few people here in the USA that can do it adequately.\n\nFor Jawari bridge carving I use Scott Hackleman in Washington.\n\nhttp://www.hacklemanshop.com\n\nHe is a masterful craftsman and studied at the Kartar Chand shop in India for a year.\n\nHe wrote a great paper on sitar making for The Guild of American Luthiers.\n\nhttp://www.hacklemanshop.com/uploads...tar_making.pdf\n\nYou can also use Tony Karasek, who is masterful as well.\n\nHe used to travel with Pandit Ravi Shankar, keeping his sitars in perfect order.\n\nHe does amazing Jawari, and also builds his own incredible sitars.\n\nHis website has a lovely museum section showing a ton of the finest vintage sitars.\n\nhttp://www.karaseksound.com\n\nThere is also Kalyan at the Musicians Mall in Berkeley.\n\nhttps://www.musiciansmallusa.com/repair/\n\nFor buying a high quality sitar, I would buy from Rain City Music.\n\nhttp://www.raincitymusic.com\n\nThe owner Lars travels to India regularly and hand picks the best ones he finds.\n\nHe has everything from very inexpensive student sitars, up to very fine professional sitar.\n\nHe makes sure they are all set up and sounding as good as they can before shipping.\n\nAs with mandolins, the more expensive sitars are certainly leaps and bounds above the cheaper ones.\n\nLuckily sitars are remarkably cheap compared to mandolins.\n\nYou can get a wonderful Hiren Roy for $2,000-3,000.\n\nHiren Roy was one the greatest sitar makers of the last century.\n\nYou can find vintage ones, and also brand new ones from his son Barun.\n\nNikhil Banerjee played a Hiren Roy, as do I.\n\nI actually found my Hiren Roy on Craigslist for $500.\n\nIt was a bit like finding a Lloyd Loar being sold by someone who doesn't know what they have.\n\nIt had been sitting in a closet for 20 years, and after Scott Hackleman cleaned it and set it up, it was magical.\n\nI found that stunning Naskar sitar on eBay for $1000\n\nThe other Naskar I found on eBay for $300.\n\nThe eBay thing can be hit or miss, as you never know what you will get.\n\nLike mandos, unless you play it, how can you know.\n\nEven a nice looking Gibson can be a log.\n\nThere is a very useful Forum for general ICM and the sitar, sarod, tabla, etc.\n\nAs with MandolinCafe.com, it is a place to ask about Instruments, Ragas, etc.\n\nhttps://forum.chandrakantha.com"
