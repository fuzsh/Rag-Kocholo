        "text": "2022 studio album by (G)I-dle\n\nI Never Die (stylized in all caps) is the first studio album by South Korean girl group (G)I-dle. It was released digitally on March 14, 2022 and physically the following day, by Cube Entertainment. It consists of three physical versions: RiSKY, CHiLL and SPOiLED, and contains eight tracks, including the lead single \"Tomboy\". The album marks the group's first release as a quintet following the departure of member Soojin in August 2021, and the fifth release in the 'I' series, following I Burn (2021). Members Soyeon, Minnie, and Yuqi served as the album's primary producers and songwriters.\n\nLyrically, the album focuses on speaking out against prejudices, exuding self-confidence, embracing one's own darker self, self-healing, and the feelings after breakups. Musically, it's an alternative rock, pop, R&B, and hip-hop record that experiments with rock, 2000s emo-teen, classic rock, and electro-pop sounds, with its songs characterized by a wide-range of upbeat instruments such as electric guitar and drums.\n\nI Never Die received generally favorable reviews from music critics, who complimented its cohesiveness, concept, art direction, rock production, and lyrical themes, as well as the group's musical growth. However, criticism was made over the album's short length. Domestically, it was a commercial success, debuting at number two on the Circle Album Chart with over 200,000 copies sold in its first week. Additionally, it was certified double-platinum by Korean Music Content Association. In China, the album became the second best-selling album by a K-pop act in 2022 after Born Pink, with over 560,000 digital units sold.[1]\n\nThe album was released on the same day as the lead single \"Tomboy\", which reached number one on both the Circle Digital Chart and K-pop Hot 100. The single managed to stay in the top ten on the said charts for multiple weeks. (G)I-dle performed other tracks \"My Bag\" and \"Villain Dies\", alongside the lead single, on South Korean music program M Countdown and live on 2022 MAMA Awards, 2022 Melon Music Awards and 37th Golden Disc Awards. In support of the album, the group embarked on Just Me ( )I-dle World Tour in 2022.\n\nBackground and release\n\n[edit]\n\nIn January 2021, the group released their fourth extended play I Burn, which detailed the various emotions experienced during the process of finding happiness after separation.[2] It received generally positive reviews from contemporary critics.[3][4] It debuted at number three on the Gaon Album Chart, becoming the group's fifth top ten album in the country, and scored their best opening-week sales, selling 115,500 copies.[5] The EP also marked as their final release as a sextet before Soojin's hiatus and subsequent departure from the group in August 2021.\n\nIn an interview with E-Daily, Miyeon revealed that (G)I-dle might be promoting as a group \"sooner than fans expect\" and that they \"will show you lots of new and cool sides of ourselves this year\".[6] On February 17, 2022 Cube Entertainment stated that the group was preparing to release new music in March.[7] On February 24, 2022, the label announced that (G)I-dle would be releasing their first studio album, titled I Never Die, on March 14.[8] On February 25, a black-and-white comeback trailer was released.[9] On February 28, the track listing was revealed, with \"Tomboy\" announced as the lead single, followed by a lyric poster on March 1.[10] Concept photos were released on March 2, 3 and 4.[11] An audio snippet was published on March 7,[12] with music video teasers on March 11 and 12.[13][14] I Never Die was released worldwide on March 14, 2022 through Cube Entertainment, in conjunction with a music video for \"Tomboy\".[15]\n\nComposition\n\n[edit]\n\nMusic and lyrics\n\n[edit]\n\nThe standard edition of I Never Die is twenty-four minutes long, consisting of eight tracks. The CD adds an explicit version of \"Tomboy\". The majority of the album, including the lead single, was co-written and produced by member Soyeon.[16] Yuqi participated in the creation of \"Liar\" and \"Polaroid\", while Minnie contributed to \"Already\" and \"Escape\".[16] I Never Die is primarily a pop, alternative rock, rock, R&B, and hip hop record with influences of rock.[17][18] The album focuses on speaking out against prejudices and exuding self-confidence.[18][19]\n\nI wanted to show the spirit and determination of the (G)I-dle through the album name itself. It contains our feelings and thoughts about all the prejudices in the world and I thought about how the five of us, who have grown up, should look like. I wanted to make an album that proves our worth.\n\n— Soyeon, Naver.[20]\n\nSongs\n\n[edit]\n\nThe opening track \"Tomboy\" is a grimy, empowering alternative rock, rock and pop-punk song about independence and breaking the \"perfect girlfriend\" stereotype.[17][16] The track is set to reverberating guitar riffs and drum beats with lyrics such as \"I'm not a doll\", and \"Just me I-DLE\".[21] \"Never Stop Me\" is a rock-leaning song with 2000s emo-teen influences that expresses the feelings of a breakup.[21] In the third track \"Villain Dies\", the group \"proudly embrace their darker side\".[21] It is a dark electro-pop song that also combines hip hop and rock with \"ominous\" violin.[21] \"Already\" is a soft R&B and pop acknowledgement song that just \"because there's been healing, [it] doesn’t mean [that] the scars have disappeared altogether\".[21] The fifth track \"Polaroid\" is a mesmerizing and nostalgic R&B song with a heartwarming message about (G)I-dle's desire to live in the moment and capture their youth in their memories like they would capture something in a polaroid photo.[21] \"Escape\" was made for \"those who become tired of everything and feel like giving up, as this will provide warm consolation and care\". \"Liar\" is a classic rock song with electric guitar. It presents the \"spirited act\" of the group standing up for themselves and realizing that it is better to let a bad thing go.[21] The \"bombastic\" and \"proud\" closing track \"My Bag\" is a climactic song where all members show off their rapping prowess against a hip-hop instrumental.[21]\n\nCritical reception\n\n[edit]\n\nProfessional ratingsReview scoresSourceRatingGenius[22]IZM[23]NME[21]The Kraze10/10[24]\n\nI. Raj Tanu of NME give the album four stars out of five, praising the \"cohesive narrative about becoming your own person\", the group's usage of various genres, and their overall growth writing, \"it may be their 'first' full-length album, but it is almost poetic how it proverbially culminates the story of this woman. She's bloomed into her own. She's meandered through adversity and self-doubt to be born anew – and this new avatar is here to stay.\" Tanu further elaborated: \"I Never Die is less of a proclamation and more of an assurance for (G)I-dle themselves – peel away the bravado, gumption and even the wondrous layers, and you'll find a simple promise: no matter what, they will always make it through, and they will always be here.\"[21]\n\nIZM's Yeom Dong-gyo proclaimed it as an \"album that gives persuasive power to a solid concept\", praising the album's \"colorful style\", its direction, vision, the \"powerful\" rock production, and \"the lyrics that support the album's theme\". However, he criticizes the album's short length.[23]\n\nGenius's Maddison Murray wrote, \"I Never Die is (G)I-dle at their strongest and most incredible to date, exploring a range of concepts while still staying cohesive and true to the group’s vision. Minnie, Miyeon, Soyeon, Shuhua, and Yuqi get to show off their impeccable talents in ways unlike Neverland [the group's fandom] has ever seen before, and the result is a beautiful album that fans will cherish for years to come. Heading into the fifth year of their career, it’s more clear than ever that (G)I-dle are industry frontrunners who will continue to push themselves into new territory with experimental sounds, introspective lyrics, and performances like the world has never seen. Their confidence, reign on the charts, and impact on fans globally will never die.\"[22]\n\nTime's Kat Moon praised the overall production and lyrics writing, \"Across eight tracks, (G)I-dle impresses not just with performance but with production: every song has credits from Soyeon, Minnie, or Yuqi. And while the group begins to challenge stereotypes in the lead single \"Tomboy\"—where they refuse to become a \"blond barbie doll\" to meet societal standards—(G)I-dle builds upon the rebellious energy in the tracks that follow. The album takes a more gentle turn from \"Already to \"Escape\" before shifting back to the hard and heavy through the rock-leaning \"Liar.\" But the final number \"My Bag,\" a propulsive hip hop-infused banger featuring all five members rapping, is the project's standout.\"[25]\n\nYear-end lists\n\n[edit]\n\nYear-end lists for I Never Die Critic/Publication List Rank Note(s) Ref.
