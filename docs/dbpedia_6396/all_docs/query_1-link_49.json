It's the only router I've continually used for such a long time.\n\nI originally reviewed this router (in my previous life) at its launch and called it the Nexus of wireless routers. Soon after, I got one for my personal use. In the years that followed, I reviewed many other routers. So when I say I now still find mine one of the best, I speak from experience.\n\nIndeed, via firmware updates, Asus has managed to keep the RT-AC88U's performance and features on par (and even better in many cases) with the latest Wi-Fi 5 (802.11ac) routers, including the recent RT-AC86U of its own.\n\nThat, plus the unique eight LAN ports and the support for AiMesh, make this router worth every penny of its current $235 price tag.\n\nAsus RT-AC88U: Almost perfect for nerds\n\nLike all routers, the RT-AC88U is far from perfect. It has a USB 3.0 port right on the front and mediocre network storage performance coupled with a portable drive. It was also a bit buggy with early firmware versions.\n\nBut to compensate, the router has top 4x4 Wi-Fi 5 (802.11ac) specs and sports a 1.4 dual-core CPU, among the most potent for routers at its time. However, what makes it unique is the eight Gigabit LAN ports (as opposed to just four in most routers).\n\nAs a result, it can host more wired devices out of the box before you need to resort to a switch. Even by today's standard, the extra LAN ports are still a novelty.\n\n(Note on Asus RT-AC88U vs. RT-AC3100: Asus also makes the RT-AC3100, which is very similar to the RT-AC88U—both are AC3100 routers. The two look almost identical, except from the back where the RT-AC3100 has the usual four LAN ports.)\n\nBut there's more. The Asus RT-AC88U was one of the first home routers with Link Aggregation, allowing users to combine two LAN ports into a single 2Gbps connection.\n\nI have used this feature from day one with my Synology NAS server and loved it. Link Aggregation is one of the main reasons I kept using this router despite having many opportunities to replace it.\n\nThere's even more! You can also turn one of its LAN ports into a second WAN port. If you have two broadband connections, such as DSL and Cable, you can use both simultaneously to increase speed (load-balancing) or have high availability (fail-over).\n\nI tried this feature out, too, and it worked well. By the way, for load-balancing, make sure you use two broadband connections of similar speed grades. If that's not the case, it's better to use them in the fail-over mode.\n\nYet, there's more. The RT-AC88U becomes an even better router for nerds and geeks when they put the Merlin firmware on it. Try that out if you're up for some adventures.\n\nAsus RT-AC88U: Hardware specifications\n\nAsus RT-AC88U: Detail photos\n\nThe Asus RT-AC88U has quite a few things to show off. From the beautiful design to its generous amount of network port to its quite cool removable antennas. Here are a few photos for your enjoyment.\n\nUseful features\n\nWith the latest firmware, the Asus RT-AC88U has all the features available in new Asus routers. These include AiProtection, Adaptive QoS, Game Boost, and so on. Over the years, I've used all the router's features, and they have become the base standard for me to evaluate other routers.\n\nAsus RT-AC88U’s features in screenshots\n\nWhat I like the most, however, is the Wake on LAN function, which is part of the Network Tools. I use this regularly to turn on other computers or servers within my network remotely.\n\nI also frequently use the VPN server to connect to home while traveling. The router can also work as a VPN client if you want your home network to be part of another home's or office's network.\n\nExcellent support for AiMesh\n\nAiMesh, introduced via a firmware update earlier this year, is the best feature of Asus routers. The RT-AC88U is one of about a dozen routers that support this feature, and it does so really well, both as the primary router and as a node.\n\nSpeaking of AiMesh, during the review of the RT-AC86U, I used the RT-AC88U as one of the AiMesh nodes. After that, I wanted to use it as the primary router, and to my pleasant surprise, that was easy.\n\nI just needed to upload the settings of the RT-AC86U (from a backup file) onto the RT-AC88U, and the latter will take over, retaining all user configurations, including those of the AiMesh feature (other nodes and so on). There was no need to build the mesh from scratch.\n\nAsus RT-AC88U: Excellent performance\n\nI tested the RT-AC88U with its latest firmware available at the time of this review, and it did even better than a few years ago.\n\nFast Wi-Fi speeds\n\nOn the 5GHz, at a close range of shorter than 10 feet, it registered a sustained rate of almost 850 megabits per second. When I increased the distance to 40 feet away, it now still averaged more than 600 Mbps.\n\nOn the 2.4GHz, the router wasn't as impressive but still comparatively fast with almost 200 Mbps and more than 110 Mbps for close and long distances, respectively.\n\nThe router also has excellent coverage, covering a home of 2000 ft² (186 m²) on its own when placed close to the center. It's also reliable. I did need to restart it a few times unexpectedly in the past few years, but that was it.\n\nBy the way, for best performance, I'd recommend restarting your router, whichever you use, once in a while. The RT-AC88U (and most Asus routers) allow you to schedule a periodical restart at the time of your choosing.\n\nStill mediocre USB-based network storage\n\nI also tested the network storage, and there was no improvement. I connected a Samsung T5 to the router's front USB 3.0 port via a Gigabit connection, it registered less than 30 MB/s of copy speeds.\n\nThis type of performance is not good enough to handle the router's vast amount of storage features. Also, during my storage testing, the router's interface became sluggish. It seems its 1.4GHz dual-core CPU and 512MB of RAM aren't enough to handle the latest firmware's demand for multi-tasking.\n\nIt's a good thing that I've always had a dedicated NAS server, and so should you if you want to enjoy network storage with this router.\n\nConclusion\n\nConsidering my line of work, it's not usual for me to keep using a router for a long time, but Asus RT-AC88U is a keeper. I think I'll use it for a while longer before having to finally replace it with a Wi-Fi 6 (802.11ax) router.\n\nSince Wi-Fi 6 will take a few years to mature, if you're looking for a reliable router now, I still recommend the RT-AC88U. It'll serve you well for many years to come."
