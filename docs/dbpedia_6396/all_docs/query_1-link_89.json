        "text": "| Editor’s Pick | Malaysia | 9 May 2017 | Asia Samachar |\n\nBy Word Of A Singh\n\nOn the 3rd November 1970, Mr Therashan Singh and his wife were blessed with a son named Harjinder Singh in Buntong, Perak and was then brought up in Penang.\n\nVeer Harjinder tied a knot with an incredibly gorgeous lady named Sarvinder Kaur from Perai, Pulau Pinang in the year 1995.In the year 1998, Veer Harjinder and Phenji Sarvinder were blessed with their very first child named Gursimran Kaur. In the year 2002, they were blessed once again with a daughter named Bhavenjeet Kaur followed by a son named Naamdev Singh in 2004, a daughter named Kesminder Kaur in 2005 and followed by the youngest child of the family, Amritleen Kaur in 2008. In short, they were blessed with four beautiful Shehzaadis’ and a handsome Shehzadaa! Veer Harjinder is an active member of SNSM [Sikh Naujawan Sabha Malaysia] and he is even a president of Penang’s SNSM branch.\n\n10th April 2013- “You have to be back, no matter what, ok?”\n\nThe ulcer at the small intestines burst and the poison from it started to spread to every part of Veer Harjinder’s body. It all started with gastritis and it slowly became severe. His stomach started to bloat and it eventually got hard as a stone. It became worse when he was on his treatment in one of the government hospitals in Seberang Jaya. The doctors would give an injection and send him home. That’s it! He was then admitted in the same government hospital in Seberang Jaya. After a couple of days being admitted in the hospital, at around 3am, he saw a ray of light and he could hear someone telling him, “Nikaljaa ehto,etho chaljaa!”. He got up immediately and contacted his father to get him discharged. He was then rushed to one of the private hospitals in Penang Island, Hospital Lam Wah Ee. He was then examined by the doctors on the spot. The doctors did scoping and discovered the actual matter. There was ulcer at the small intestines and it actually burst and the poison from the ulcer began spreading to every part of his body and he had to go through a major operation. Our dearest Veer had only 20% of his life in him.\n\nWaheguru!\n\nHe had low chances for living. The doctors eventually gave up on him and said that it would be the best if the members of the family visit him for the very last time. Phenji Sarvinder and Veer Harjinder’s parents were heartbroken when they got to know about this. But, Phenji Sarvinder stood strong and believed that Veer Harjinder will come back for the sake of his kids. The kids need him. Phenji Sarvinder needs him. Everyone needs him! Veer’s father, Mr. Therashan Singh asked the doctors if there are any other options instead of letting him go. The doctor stated that there is an option where he has to go for surgery but there would be two huge risks. It’s either he might just die during the surgery or if the surgery is a success, he would receive food through the tube. Mr Therashan asked the doctors to proceed with the surgery. Veerji was unconscious during that time. He could only remember signing the documents. Phenji Sarvinder whispered to Veerji, “you have to come back for your family who are waiting for you no matter what, ok?’. Veerji nodded his head.\n\nWhen the surgery was going on, the news somehow started to spread to all his close friends and family members and all of them arrived at the hospital. There were around 80 to 90 people waiting outside the operation theatre reciting Chaupai Sahib continuously. Then, a Gianiji from Gurdwara Sahib Kulim and Veer Paramjeet Singh came to the hospital and Gianiji did an Ardaas. As soon as Gianiji was saying the Jaiikaara, the door of the operation theatre opened. One of the doctors came out and said, “What did I do? How I did? I don’t know but, the surgery is a success and Harjinder is absolutely fine.”\n\nDhan Guru Maharaj!\n\nVeerji was then shifted to the ICU and one by one went into the ICU to have a look at him. They were all relieved to see that he was doing fine. Phenji Sarvinder and one of her daughters touched his hand. He was unconscious but he responded a little bit.\n\n9th June 2016- Fourth stage Malignant Mesenchymal Tumour.\n\nIn the year 2016, Veer Harjinder had a lump on his shoulder. His family members thought the lump was just a normal thing. Sooner or later, the lump started to turn red in colour as it was growing bigger day by day. He went for a few check ups and the doctor suggested that he should get a biopsy test and MRI scanning done. Veerji was diagnosed with fourth stage Malignant Mesenchymal Tumor. As soon as Phenji Sarvinder heard about this, she was shocked. How can the doctor say this easily?\n\nIt’s hard to believe isn’t it?\n\nVeer Harjinder and Phenji Sarvinder’s eldest daughter, Gursimran Kaur who is currently studying in one of the universities in Selangor was unaware about this. Ten days later, Gursimran Kaur received a text from one of friends:\n\n“I am very sorry to hear about your dad that he is diagnosed with cancer.”\n\n“Do you even know what are you talking about my dad?”, Gursimran Kaur asked.\n\n“Maybe I heard it wrongly”, her friend replied.\n\nGursimran Kaur immediately contacted her mom and told about it. She tried to dig the truth from her mom but her mom ended up saying, “I will call you back in a while”\n\nAfter a while, Phenji Sarvinder called and asked Gursimran Kaur from where she got this news. Gursimran Kaur stated that she received it from one of her friends. Phenji Sarvinder stated that it was actually true that Veer Harjinder was suffering from cancer and she didn’t want to inform Gursimran Kaur first as finals were around the corner and she wanted her to be back home during Raya holidays. Phenji Sarvinder also stated that she actually informed Shalini who is Gursimran Kaur’s roommate first and warned her not to let the cat out of the bag.\n\nGursimran Kaur was so heartbroken. She couldn’t control her emotions and she kept on crying. It was tough for her at that time as finals were around the corner. She couldn’t stop thinking about it. She was devastated.\n\n31st July 2016- Final Walk to Freedom from Cancer.\n\nOn the 31st July 2016, Veer Harjinder was at home with his wife and kids. At around 12am, he went to the toilet and he started feeling dizzy. All in a sudden, the tumor on his shoulder exploded and puss started draining out into the sink. He was bleeding profusely. Everything started to get dark in front of him. He passed out. Phenji Sarvinder found him unconscious in the toilet.\n\nShe panicked!\n\nShe ran to get help from neighbours. Two men from the neighbourhood helped to carry Veer Harjinder from the toilet to the back seat of the car and drove him to Hospital Seberang Jaya to clot the blood as it was bleeding profusely.\n\nThe doctors managed to clot the blood which was profusely draining out from the tumor.\n\nOn the 2nd August, Veer Harjinder had to go for a surgery at Penang GH. The growth on his shoulder was quite deep. The doctors from the plastic surgery department had to help out in the surgery as they had to take the skin from the thigh and patch it on the shoulder. Veer Harjinder couldn’t walk for a few days because of it.The surgery was a success but the cancer cells were yet in his body. Sanggat started doing programmes in the Gurdwaras’ for Veer Harjinder’s wellbeing\n\n.\n\nVeer Harjinder had to go for six cycles of chemotherapy. God only knows how much of pain did our dearest Veer went through during the chemotherapy. Right after completing the six cycles of chemotherapy sessions, he had to go for a PET CT scanning which will confirm whether he is already free from cancer or not. After scanning, he got very busy with the 26th Penang Mini Samelan. Right after the Samelan, he received the news that he is free from cancer.\n\nOur dearest Veer is back fit and fine!\n\nIt was a long walk to freedom from cancer, isn’t it?\n\nMehervaan Sahib Mera Mehervaan.\n\nSee original entry at Word Of a Singh (7 May 2017) here.\n\n[ASIA SAMACHAR is an online newspaper for Sikhs in Southeast Asia and surrounding countries.

I am in the process of completing a book on the history of Malaysian Sikhs and their role in nation building.\n\nBased on existing documentary evidence, the first Sikhs who came to Malaya were Nihal Singh (popularly known as Bhai Maharaj Singh) and Kharak (also spelt as Khurruck) Singh. Bhai Maharaj Singh and Kharak Singh were political prisoners who were sentenced to exile for life due to their involvement in the anti-British movement in Punjab, India. Bhai Maharaj Singh is regarded as the soul of the first anti-British movement in Punjab. Kharak Singh was a close associate (disciple) of Bhai Maharaj Singh. Both of them landed in Singapore on 14 June 1850, and not July 1850 as stated in some books. Bhai Maharaj Singh died in solitary confinement in Singapore on 5 July 1856.\n\nKharak Singh was transferred to Fort Cornwallis, Penang in August 1857 because the British authorities feared that he (together with fellow prisoners) might cause trouble in Singapore. As stated by Kernial Singh Sandhu (an authority on Indian immigration to Malaya), other classes of Sikh convicts (besides political prisoners) were also sent to the Straits Settlements. In 1857 there were about 60–70 Sikh convicts in the Singapore jail. Some of them were transferred from Singapore to Penang to break up a particular gang. Convict immigration was prohibited after 1860. According to Kernial, there is no direct link between these exiled Sikh convicts and the current Sikh community in Malaysia and Singapore.\n\nBeginning from the 1870s, the Sikhs from the Punjab (ancestral homeland in India) started immigrating to Malaya mainly to serve in the police and paramilitary forces. The pioneer recruits were enlisted by Captain Tristram Speedy—a former Superintendent of Police in Penang—to help Ngah Ibrahim (territorial chief of Larut, Perak) restore law and order in Larut. Trade and tin mining in Larut was disrupted by frequent fighting between two warring Chinese clans (Ghee Hin and Hai San). Captain Speedy left for India on 27 July 1873 and managed to recruit 95 discharged Pathan and Punjabi (Sikhs and Punjabi Muslims) sepoys at Lahore, and not 110 as generally believed. Captain Speedy reached Penang on 29 September 1873 and proceeded straight to Larut. These sepoys were reenlisted as the Resident’s Guard after the signing of the Pangkor Engagement on 20 January 1874, and became the nucleus of the Perak Police (together with a few Malays and Chinese constables). By end 1874, the police force numbered 266 men.\n\nThe Perak police force was renamed the Perak Armed Police in 1877 under the command of Lieutenant Paul Swinburne. The Sikhs and Pathans formed the paramilitary guard and the Malays as criminal police. The Perak Armed Police was renamed on 15 May 1884 as the First Battalion Perak Sikhs to reflect its military character. By 1890, the battalion had 713 Sikhs as compared to 265 Malays.\n\nFrom 1880s onwards, Sikhs were recruited in considerable numbers in the police forces of Selangor, Negeri Sembilan and Pahang. In 1884 forty Sikhs joined the Selangor police force as a military body to provide guards in Kuala Lumpur. In 1895 the Malay contingent consisted of 503 men and the Sikh contingent 230 men. By 1890, there were 75 Sikhs in the police force of Sungai Ujong. At the beginning of 1890, the Sikh Contingent in Pahang numbered 104 and later during the same year another 50 Sikhs were recruited.\n\nThe Sikhs also formed the backbone of the Malay States Guides (MSG) established in 1896 and headquartered at Taiping, Perak. The MSG was Malaya’s first own regiment and entrusted primarily with the task of maintaining the internal security of the Federated Malay States and quelling internal disturbances. The MSG consisted of four infantry companies of Sikhs, two infantry companies of Punjabi Muslims and Pathans, and a small artillery battery with one section Sikhs and one section Punjabi Muslims. At the outbreak of war in 1914, the MSG comprised 550 Sikhs, 90 Punjabi Muslims, 210 Pathans, 3 Hindus, and 1 Malay. The MSG was disbanded in 1919.\n\nSikhs were also recruited in the police forces of the Unfederated Malay States. In 1909 the Perlis police force had 27 Sikhs whilst about 60 Sikhs formed the “Military Police” in Kelantan. By 1909, Kedah had 134 Indians (mainly Sikhs) in the rank and file of the police force. In 1915 some Sikhs were recruited into the Johore police force after a British Adviser was appointed to the state in 1914.\n\nThose Sikhs who failed to join the police and paramilitary forces took up jobs in the private sector to work as watchmen, moneylenders, bullock-cart drivers, dairymen, milk vendors, and labourers in the tin and iron ore mines. Most of the Sikh watchmen also operated as moneylenders. Thousands of Sikhs were also engaged in the construction of railway lines, including that from Gemas to Tumpat.\n\nFrom late 1920s onwards, a large number of Sikhs from the commercial and educated classes immigrated to Malaya. Most of the Sikh commercial immigrants became primarily wholesalers and retailers in the textile and sports goods trade. The educated classes were mainly attracted by offers of subordinate employment (primarily administrative and technical personnel) in the government service, particularly in the railways, prisons and hospitals.\n\nDr Ranjit Singh Malhi, who runs a management consultancy, completed his PhD in 2015 on the history of Sikhs in Malaya. He is passionate about writing history as “it is”.\n\nASIA SAMACHAR is an online newspaper for Sikhs in Southeast Asia and surrounding countries. We have a Facebook page, do give it a LIKE!

Singh\n\nA cat, no matter how meticulous and finicky, or a dog, no matter how smart, never check their watch ten times a day — not even once in a lifetime. Birds migrate thousands of miles every year and have an incredibly precise sense of the changing of seasons, but nary a computer or clock to track how time flies. Tempus fugit, as they say.\n\nEarly humans noted the passage of time by the play of day and night, as also by the changing pattern of sun, moon, and stars. Sundials date back 3500 years; sand-filled hourglasses existed over 1500 years ago.\n\nToday we seem attached by our umbilical cords to chronographs and atomic clocks that capture fractions of a second. Only humans obsess about time, whether in seconds, minutes, and hours, years, or eternity; forget not fractions like milli, micro or nano seconds.\n\nCruel is the passage of time. We are the only animal that lies about our age or needs to. And only we have created religions that promise everlasting eternal life, with its never-ending delights, or the eternal fires of damnation. Why? As a sordid attempt to deny our age-associated diminishing skills at everything.\n\nWe celebrate birthdays as markers of life that has no end? We ignore that each passing year — day, hour…moment – reminds us of time running out. “Audh ghatyae dinus rainaray…” (Guru Granth, p. 13). Commonsense affirms that only an unreal metaphoric life is eternal. Time marches on and runs out. Thus, mortality bestows challenge and quality to life.\n\nIf a life has no end, demands of quality can be deferred and choices pushed aside; in life without end there is no urgency to imperatives of meaning and value. In an eternal life there is no overwhelming hunger for meaning.\n\nBut there is a way to eternity that also addresses the purpose of life. Our past merges with the future through continuity of blood lines, community and, more importantly, through the work that we do, through issue and events that define us in this life, the societies that we create; causes for which we live and die. Matters that we have valued more than life itself. This is the way to progress and immortality.\n\nOpen any page of Sikh history for an object lesson in such events and happenings. In fact, since its inception, Sikhi has been a powerhouse in the cause of human development.\n\nIs mine then a call to the future or is this a step back into the hoary past? Past, present and future are inexorably intertwined. My call is to stand solidly in the present, rooted comfortably in the soil of the past, resolutely facing the future. That’s how the past becomes prologue to the future. Forget not that the past is dead, the future yet unborn, the moment of the present is ours to shape and breathe life into our future.\n\nIt is important in life to look ahead, also to look back. Perhaps at my stage in life I look back just as much, if not a tad more, than forward into the future. Peering more often into the future would make me an optimist; if I largely crane my neck to reclaim the past, then I am surely a pessimist. On some days, the swinging pendulum has a measurable bias; it need not be age-dependent. Remember that one phase lengthens while the second progressively shortens and one day the pendulum will swing no more.\n\nAwareness of time, efforts to control its flight, and adding meaning and purpose to it seem uniquely human traits. Yet, time is neither our mind’s slave, nor its invention. Time is not a prison that can hold the human mind. There are myriad ways to measure time, but none to slow it or stop it – not in this world, not in this life.\n\nFinally, at the end of life when the clock runs out, Gurbani posits a challenge to each one of us. It asks, what footprints will you leave in the sands of time (Eh sareera merya iss jug meh aye ke kya tudh karam kamayya? p. 917).\n\nI.J.

(Asia Samachar, 29 Sept 2016)\n\n| Petaling Jaya, Malaysia | 12 May 2017 | Asia Samachar |\n\nBy Mohan Singh Rendhawa\n\nIt is hoped the annual general meeting (AGM) of the Gurdwara Sahib Petaling Jaya (GSPJ) on Sunday (14 May 2017) will decide on the fate of the old Petaling Jaya gurdwara land and make a decision on what can be done to this valuable property.\n\nIt is hoped the Sangat (congregation) will take this matter more seriously and give priority to the redevelopment of the old gurdwara building in addition to the renovation of the present gurdwara building facilities. If not another few years will pass and the place will remain the same.\n\nThe AGM should vote a sum of RM1 million for this purpose and set up a committee of youthful members of the GSPJ to work on this project. Forty eight years have gone by since we moved out of the old gurdwara and nothing has been done to add value to the property.\n\nMost Gurdwaras like the Gurdwara Sahib Tatt Khalsa Diwal in Kuala Lumpur have multiple sources of income. In addition to the “mehha tek” (golak) and degh money, they have a big hall that is rented for additional income. I believe their car park generates monthly income of around RM15,000. They have rooms and shops lots rented out.\n\nEarning money from other sources is not a new practice. I know Gurdwara Sahib Kuching has income from shops that are on rent since more then 50 years ago. Gurdwara Sahib Rawang also has income from shops on the main road that are rented out. GSPJ is only earning RM600 per month (from the old gurdwara building). This can be increased if we make strategic use of the land of the old gurdwara to benefit our youth and next generation.\n\nSEE ALSO: Petaling Jaya old gurdwara building in dire straits\n\nSEE ALSO: Managing gurdwara funds transparently, with accountability\n\nSince writing the Letter to Editor of Asia Samachar on 5 May 2017, I have been approached by many of my friends and people whom I did not know before to tell me that they were not aware that this place existed. Many felt sad that the Petaling Jaya gurdwara management committees (GMC) over the last 48 years have neglected this place and allowed it to deteriorate to such a level. Many felt that the land is strategically location, being next to the Assunta Hospital and the Majlis Perbandaran Petaling Jaya (MBPJ) sports complex. They gave the view that it will be good if we build a two or three storey apartments to be rented out as the 252 room hospital will have many outstation visitors and families of people undergoing treatment who will want a place to stay close to the hospital to visit their loved ones.\n\nOthers came and shared their childhood stories of how they used to make Guru Ka Langgar using charcoal stoves as we did not use gas those days. I met an ex-RMAF veteran who said he and his family rented the old gurdwara builiding and stayed there for 30 years. According to this veteran, he used to repair and maintain the place while he was living there. He confirmed that the place, being all made of wood, is infested with termites and he had to put in additional pillars to prevent the house from collapsing.\n\nManmohan Singh from MAS said: “My grandfather Ala Singh, a retired accountant from Malayan Railways, was the first GSPJ treasurer and my father Chatar Singh, Senior Engineer LLN, was the gurdwara’s first secretary.” He added that during big celebrations donations were usually in kind. One person will donate all the dhall for the day, another all the atta and yet another all the degh.\n\nManmohan is not sure of the details but he said: “A group of senior citizens paid for the house around 1962/63. They could be my grandfather Ala Singh, Darshan Singh, Labh Singh, Lall Singh and may be Gurbachan Singh the father of our current GSPJ manager Jaspal Singh. They broke the walls and converted the place into a big hall with three rooms at the back. Two rooms were for the granthi and one room for Punjabi class. Even at that time, importance was given to teaching of Gurmukhi as the foundation of reading the SGGS.”\n\nIt must have been a struggle for these senior citizens to come up with the funds to buy this place and convert it into a gurdwara for the Sangat. It is important that we today show respect to these senior citizens and develop the land into something that will add value to the Sangat today and respect the legacy of the senior citizens who bought this place.\n\nI consulted my good friend retired Associate Professor Autar Singh of UITM, Shah Alam, who is very active in the Sikh community. I have run Adventure Camps and other youth camps with him. His views are that we should build a multi purpose hall for wedding sangeets and receptions.\n\nI agree with this idea as hall rentals today are high and families wanting to conduct small sangeets and family functions find it hard to find a suitable space. Government halls are available but they have rules of not allowing any form of alcoholic beverages inside the hall. The old gurdwara land build up space is about 2,400 sq ft. I guess this will be sufficient for the Sangeet of a decent size.\n\nAssociate Professor Autar also suggested that Sikh NGO’s like Sikh Women’s Awareness Network (SWAN), Selangor Sikh Association (SSA) and others can rent office space. If a kitchen space can be added to the multipurpose hall, then SWAN can also use the place to have cooking classes for ladies and teenagers. “It will also be good if we can include a couple of seminar rooms with a capacity of 75 to 150 participants,” he said.\n\nI guess a multipurpose hall of the size of 2,400 sq ft can easily accommodate this need. He also recommended one floor for short term stay to generate revenue for the gurdwara and we look into providing adequate parking space underground. These suggestions, if followed, will create a facility that the community can use for many years to come.\n\nThe question is that the AGM on Sunday has to decide on what can be done to use the old gurdwara land to achieve maximum benefit for the next generation. Turning it into a sports center for youth will be a waste of resources as there is a more beautiful and well equipped Majlis Petaling Jaya Sports Complex 200 meters from this location that our youth can use. Below are some of the options we have that will not only generate income but also add value to the Sangat. We will have an additional facility for the Petaling Jaya future generation.\n\nThree-level building: Area 60’x80’. After set back 40’x 60’ = 2400 sq ft available to build. We can build 4×600 sq ft apartments per level. At the moment we look at 3 levels.\n\nEach unit can be rented out for RM 800.\n\nIncome per floor RM 800x 4 = RM 3,200 x 3 floors = RM 9,600 per month.\n\nApproximate construction cost: RM200 per sq ft x 600 sq ft = RM 120,000 per unit x 4 units = 480,000 per floor. RM480,000 x 3 floors = RM 1,440,000. For a start the AGM can vote a sum of RM1 million for this project.\n\nTwo-level building: On the other hand if we only build two floors of apartments and use one floor to build a multi purpose hall that can be portioned into four smaller training rooms when required and combined when required into one big hall. This way we can provide a facility for sangeet nights and receptions. This could be the ground floor level. There is a big demand for meeting rooms in the Klang Valey.\n\nOn Sunday evenings, a Gurmat vichaar group is paying RM500 for a two-hour use of an AV Room with PA system and LCD projector at the Brickfields College Asia (BCA) building located within walking distance of the present GSPJ.\n\nEight unit apartment with training rooms: The other alternative is to build 8 units of apartments and 4 training rooms. If we build only 8 apartments and 4 air conditioned meeting rooms equipped with PA system, LCD projectors and chairs, just like BCA, we can charge RM500 per day, compared to RM500 for two hours. If all the training rooms are used only 5 times per month the Gurdwara earns RM500 x 4 x 5 = RM 10,000 per month. The rest of the time these AV rooms can be used by our youth to conduct training programs. Apartment Income: RM 800 x 8 = RM 6,400. Total income will be RM16,400 per month. On the other hand, if we rent the training rooms out for 15 days a month, the income from the training rooms alone will be RM 30,000 per month. This is achievable if we do aggressive marketing of the facility.\n\nThe 14 May AGM has to make a decision to redevelop the old gurdwara building into a useful place for the Sangat. The views expressed here are only one or two persons views but leaving the old gurdwara building is going to be a waste of a valuable resource.\n\nAnother 48 years will pass before some one else like me takes up this as an issue. It is , therefore, very important that the AGM elect a committee made up of youthful members of the Sangat to come up with a plan on how best to utilise this valuable land. The meeting should also vote a sum of RM1 million to the development of the old gurdwara builiding and set up a committee to get the project started.\n\n[Lt Col (Rtd) Mohan Singh Rendhawa, who retired from the Malaysian armed forces, is an active social worker and a trainer.

Just days before that, he told his wife that his life was coming to an end and he was sorry that he had to leave her alone to fend for the children. His parting words simply were: “My time is up. With me gone, the family will need you more than ever. Be there for them. Please don’t come too soon after me.”\n\nMy auntie, Madam Swaran Kaur, was only 61 then. It was the beginning of a long journey which was going to be spent without her spouse, her precious half, her faithful companion of decades. Rather than allowing the separation to weaken her, she stood up to the challenge and took over the lead in the family.\n\nNothing was easy for my auntie. First, she lost her mother when she was barely 13, and as was the practice those days, she got married at the age of 18. She became an instant mother to two of her younger siblings. Besides having her 11 own children, she also had to look after her ailing father, all of which, she took in her stride. She did not complain or lament. Instead, she saw it as an opportunity to serve her family. Her husband was a fine gentleman and very understanding. There was enough room, space and food for everyone. There was fun and laughter in the house, and lots of prayers, too. Uncle was the sole bread winner but he did remarkably well to finance the needs of the family.\n\nAfter uncle’s death in 1993, auntie soldiered on in life. She had her husband’s pension to rely on. Besides, by this time, most of her children were already working and helped out with the needs of the family. She continued the good governance of the house and the family. Her children were very caring and supportive, thanks to excellent upbringing, and that definitely was a much-needed and timely boost to recover from uncle’s death. By God’s Grace and through auntie’s perseverance, life slowly and steadily returned to normal. But it was not free from challenges.\n\nExactly a month after losing her husband, her first challenge was the handling of one of her daughter’s inevitable divorce. Society was judgemental then, and divorce was a taboo topic. However, she stood by her daughter, giving her all the support and encouragement needed to facilitate the separation process. It must have been very painful, but the pain was well-concealed by Auntie. She was a steady pillar of strength for her daughter.\n\nTragedy struck again in 2004 when Auntie lost her eldest son. Yet again, during such times when people are choked with emotions, she showed strength. She kept the family intact by showering love and care to her daughter-in-law and her three granddaughters, just as before. The relationship between them has remained strong till today.\n\nBesides losing her son, she lost a brother in 1995 and a sister in 2000. Being the eldest in the family, she was instrumental in keeping the family together and helping them to remain composed and strong during the difficult times. Her mere presence was a show of strength. She was a woman made of steel, not one that would break down easily. Of course, it’s hard to hold back tears when a loved one is gone forever, but she was remarkable when it came to holding back her emotions – cool and calm in facing challenges and adversities of life!\n\nFAMILY VALUES, PRAYER\n\nOne of auntie’s most significant contribution to her family was the instilling of family values and the importance of prayer. There was general calm in the house, immense respect for elders and mutual respect among siblings. Everyone had a role to play – household chores were evenly distributed. The family sat together for the evening prayer daily – with uncle leading the prayers. After his demise, auntie took over the lead. Such was the practice that eventually every member of the family could lead the prayer. And this practice continues today in the homes of her children and grandchildren. It was simply leadership through example.\n\nAnother virtue that auntie possessed was the showering of unconditional love to everyone. For this, the whole family held her in high esteem. In a large family, it’s quite impossible to remain impartial. There will always be favourites, the blue-eyed ones. Auntie was amazingly different. She loved everyone the same, always fair and equal. She treated everyone with respect and love, and she did it without any expectations. She knew the favourite food of all her siblings, children and grandchildren, and rest assured, the food would be served when they visited her. No guest to the house was small. The unconditional love was even felt by her nephews and nieces, who were always welcome to her home. Most relatives would make a short stopover at Tanjung Malim each time they passed by the town. Besides the warm hospitality and company of Auntie, the freshly prepared tea savoured with biscuits and home-made cookies was a perfect combination to rejuvenate the tired bodies.\n\nI am extremely indebted to Auntie for all the help that she rendered to my family. When my mother suffered a hypertension stroke in 1978, resulting in paralysis for 22 years, Auntie was a familiar figure in our home. She visited my Mum at every available opportunity, and was a valuable companion who always provided comforting words and encouragement to her. Besides, she took over many roles that Mum could no longer play. For example, she helped us out in an advisory role during festivals and functions especially weddings. She was a big asset in helping my wife cope with events before and after the delivery of children, staying with us for almost the entire confinement period.\n\nLOVE, JOY & LAUGHTER\n\nAuntie continued to enjoy a special place in the hearts of all the people around her. Her siblings, especially the two younger siblings to whom she was more than a mother, made frequent visits to her home. Her children and grandchildren had every reason to come over the weekend or holidays. Her house remained a hive of activity – filled with love, joy and laughter, and merry-making. The daily prayers remained a fixed feature of the house, never mind the occasion or number of people in it.\n\nOver the years, with the advancement of age, came the first tell-tale signs of wear and tear. Auntie had the first of a series of heart-related problems in 1997, and this was a source of constant concern and worry ever since. Diabetes was her other health problem. Her diet had to be carefully watched, something her children prepared diligently and enforced piously on her. Along the way, she also had some loss of hearing, which was offset through the use of a hearing aid. None of this could stop her from doing what she wanted – she kept receiving and visiting relatives and friends, and attending social and religious functions. Travelling, especially long distance, was becoming more difficult, but travel she did where she felt her presence was necessary.\n\nDespite the love showered on her and extreme care taken, both in terms of hygiene and food, the time comes when we have to part with our loved ones. Somehow, a reason pops out of nowhere, a reason that signals the end of the road. The end of a journey.\n\nIn early February this year, while I was away on holiday in Sarawak with my family, I received shocking and depressing news that Auntie was critically ill with a series of complications. We had the holiday, with her on our minds and in our hearts at all times. We prayed for her swift recovery. She was not only an Auntie, she was more of a mum to us all.\n\nAuntie kept fighting for days. There was hope that yet again she would prevail and pull through. Upon our return, we headed straight to University Hospital. At the ICU unit, the sight of her family and relatives greeted us. There were scores of them. They were all reciting prayers endlessly for her wellbeing and recovery. Her children and grandchildren even took turns to recite prayers by her side. There was no sobbing, but warm hugs and words of consolation. The elders kept everyone composed through prayer. If there was any force that could possibly bring her back, it could only be the divine force. A miracle. An act of God.\n\nI went into Auntie’s room with mixed emotions, knowing very well that she was on a ventilator, sedated heavily and fighting for her dear life. What I saw was not a pleasant sight to behold. Noboby likes to see a loved one in such a sorry state, lying almost motionless, living with the support of machines which were supporting almost all her bodily functions. This evoked memories of the last few days of my late mother who was in similar condition. This was a very emotional moment, a moment when time stands still and you lose all sanity!\n\nUpon calling out to her, she tried to open her eyes but was too weak. A gentle touch on her shoulder and feet was all I could manage. The only consolation – she looked at peace with herself, and had a radiant glow on her face, as if ready to meet her Creator. I barely stood for a few minutes, reciting a short prayer for her wellbeing.\n\nThe Auntie who gave her all for umpteen years with an open heart and outstretched arms with immense hospitality, was now confined to bed, heavily sedated in a solitary room, unable to even offer a simple greeting. There was little she could offer now. It was our turn to do whatever we could to facilitate her departure. While the medical team worked on the wonders of science tirelessly, we sought divine help.\n\nHer family kept faith, very strong faith. They took turns to keep vigil the whole day and night. Each time the doctors came for a visit, there was mixed news, sometimes good but most of the time bad. Slowly, she was sinking. One after another, the complications grew.\n\nThe doctors worked round the clock to cope with each complication, not giving up hope. There was always something they could do, and they did. And for this, the family is extremely indebted to the team of doctors who attended to Auntie. Their determination to give their best was motivation for the family, and the family united in prayer.\n\nLate one night, the inevitable time arrived. Almost all her children gathered around her, gently touching her and assuring her that all was well. They were prepared to release her. She was already 85 years old, and had served the family for 24 years after her husband passed away. She had more than fulfilled all the duties and responsibilities that her husband left to her. She honoured her husband’s request of not coming too soon after him. Did she? Most certainly. She far exceeded that request.\n\nAmidst the recitation of prayers by her family, Auntie left us for Heavenly abode that night. The curtain came down to signal the end of an illustrious and successful journey.\n\nFINAL GOODBYE\n\nIt’s never easy to say the final goodbye, but we learnt from Auntie the art of doing so. Auntie and her legacy will continue to guide and light up our lives. Fond memories of her, from now on, will be our consolation, and I believe all her daughters and granddaughters will carry on with the special role and emulate her to be an exemplary mum. A mum for all seasons.\n\nHappy Mother’s Day, Auntie!\n\nMay God bless you and all mothers with His divine Grace .\n\nJaginder Singh is from Batu Gajah in Perak, Malaysia.

It has been tough when one funds raising team after another comes knocking on the same doors.\n\nThis is one of the areas that Baldev Singh – a retired banker who had offered himself to lead the gurdwara management committee (GMC) for the first time – wanted to do. He felt that Gurdwara Sahib Petaling Jaya (GSPJ) seriously needS to relook at its financing which is largely dependent on direct donations.\n\n“We cannot go back to members every now and then. Many other gurdwaras are also seeking funding. Its virtually impossible to tap the same people again and again. So gurdwaras should have investment income,” he told Asia Samachar.\n\nHowever, Baldev would not be able to directly lead the Gurdwara Sahib Petaling Jaya (GSPJ) as it holds its annual general meeting today (14 May 2017). His nomination form to run for president was rejected on technicalities as it contained some faulty information.\n\nSEE ALSO: Petaling Jaya old gurdwara building in dire straits\n\nSEE ALSO: Wheelchair-bound Keshvinder Kaur eagerly awaits completion of Subang gurdwara\n\nHis form was not the only rejected. Both candidates for the vice president post – outgoing secretary Avtar Singh ‘Terry’ and former president Harphajan Kaur – have also seen their forms rejected, also on technicalities.\n\nAs reported earlier, Baldev had accepted the decision to knock off his nomination form, saying: “I accept the decision. Constitution is supreme.” However, he and his team are expected to raise the manner of handling the nomination forms at the meeting today.\n\nCHARDIKALA TEAM\n\nBadging themselves as the Chardikala Team 2017, they released a manifesto listing four items that they would like to pursue if given the mandate to run the GSPJ committee for the next two years.\n\nTopping the list is upgrading the gurdwara’s existing facilities, including installation of lift, which they say has been overdue for the last 10 years.\n\nThe team also intend to redevelop the old gurdwara to generate income, implement development programmes to attract the youth back to gurdwara; and develop GSPJ as a centre of learning through improved Punjabi education and gurmat studies.\n\nThe members listed in the team included Harbajan Kaur, Semret Singh, Ravindar Singh, Amarjeet Singh, Balvinder Singh, Harjinder Singh, Dr Gurcharan Singh, Davinder Singh, Kernail Singh Shounki, Mohan Singh, Nirmal Singh, Satvinder Singh, Satwant Singh and Shamsher Singh.\n\nThey are up against the incumbent team led by outgoing president Gurdeep Singh, who now technically would assume the post unopposed. Some key members of the team include Avtar and Tarlocahan Singh Dhaliwal who is their candidate for the secretary post.\n\nNEW GURDWARAS\n\nSo, what made Baldev run for the GSPJ presidency? It largely has to do with the state of the gurdwara’s finance.\n\n“Over the last one year, many Saturday and Sunday programmes have been empty. Some people have moved to Shah Alam. In one year’s time, more will move to Subang. That will be a big chunk, a big impact,” said Baldev.\n\nShah Alam, the state capital of Selangor, greeted its first gurdwara which was officially opened on 11 Dec 2015. Located 19km apart, Gurdwara Sahib Guru Nanak Shah Alam (GSGNSA) naturally now attracts Sikhs living in its vicinity, some of whom were earlier frequenting GSPJ.\n\nBy Vaisakhi 2018, the Subang Sikh Association Selangor (SSAS) hopes to see Gurdwara Sahib Subang up and running. The team there is actively raising funds to complete the four storey building, equipped with two heavy-duty lifts, estimated to cost RM4.8 million.\n\nBoth gurdwaras boast sizeable buildings and are set to be major Sikh local centres if their committees get their act right in attracting and retaining the congregation.\n\nPetaling Jaya now has to marshall on with these new realities. In the past, it was able to tap the Sikhs living further apart, but they may now be drawn to those two gurdwaras.\n\n“We welcome these gurdwaras. The Sanggat needs them,” Gurdeep told Asia Samachar in a telephone conversation.\n\nHowever, the changing landscape may impact its finances.\n\nGSPJ INCOME AND EXPENDITURE STATEMENT\n\n(Year ended 31 Dec 2016)\n\nDegh collection RM117,198 (2015: RM121,903)\n\nDonations received RM451,431 (2015: RM451,750)\n\nGolak RM29,032 (2015: RM41,849)\n\nGurpurab/jordmela collectios RM3,427 (2015: RM8,709)\n\nTOTAL RM601,088 (2015: RM624,211)\n\n“For the first time in history of this gurdwara, the receipts are less than the payment,” said Baldev. “In the past, they have always been in the positive region.”\n\nAn inspection of the GSPJ’s income and expenditure statement for year end 31 Dec 2016 shows a slight decline. The total for degh collection, donations, golak and gurpurab/jordmela collections for 2016 was RM601,088, down 3.7% from the year before at RM624,211.\n\nDEVELOPMENT PLANS\n\nAnother concern for Baldev and his team is the lackluster performance of the existing committee in pushing forward plans to fix the lift for the existing gurdwara and the development of the piece of land which used to house the old gurdwara.\n\nBut he differs on the way moving forward and expressed reservations with the ‘grand plans’ to renovate the gurdwara.\n\n“I’m saying don’t renovate. I suggested just spend on the lift. They have grand plans, costing RM2 million. I say use this money to invest in properties. At the old gurdwara, for example, we can build six apartments which can generate income. Many Chinese temples have such properties which give them income,” he said.\n\nHe pointed out that GSPJ earns RM10,000 a month from a RM2.7 million fixed deposit. He estimated that the gurdwara needs a minimum of RM60,000 for its monthly expenditure for salaries, utilities and others recurring items.\n\n“The latest rumour is that I’m against the gurdwara development. Hardly. I can see the finances clearer than many others. Lets not deceive ourselves. We need to know the realities,” he said.\n\nToday, GSPJ members will get a chance to check their realities and decide on their next course of action.\n\n[ASIA SAMACHAR is an online newspaper for Sikhs in Southeast Asia and surrounding countries.
