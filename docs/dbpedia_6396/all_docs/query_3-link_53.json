        "text": "“Naatu Naatu,” the musical centerpiece of the Telugu-language blockbuster RRR, made history this year as the first song from any Asian country’s film industry to win a Golden Globe, and it may make history once more on Oscars night. Its energetic dance sequence features two Indian men improvising elaborate choreography involving their suspenders at a British official’s garden party, which leads to a white/brown dance-off that serves as a metaphor for the anti-colonial struggle. Suffice to say in terms of Best Song nominees, it stands out from the Diane Warren-core crowd.\n\nThe American reception of “Naatu Naatu” has been warm, but shallow. The New York Times, The Wall Street Journal, and Vanity Fair have celebrated the scene and interviewed its creators, including director S. S. Rajamouli and composer M. M. Keeravani, but none of the coverage names the genre “Naatu” belongs to, or traces the decades-long history of South Indian pop. Frankly, that’s a typical reception of imported Asian hits. From “Plastic Love” and city pop to “Tunak Tunak Tun” and bhangra, Asian sounds tend to arrive stripped of their context, reduced to a musical meme—shared, yes, but then forgotten in the camera roll of history.\n\nIn truth, “Naatu Naatu” is just one example of what is called “dappankuthu” (literally “drum punch”) in Tamil or “teenmaar” (literally “three sounds”) in Telugu, a percussive, aggressive and raunchy form of pop music with roots in both Chennai and Hyderabad, the respective homes of the Tamil and Telugu-language film industries. The genre has its origins in street music, when Dalit musicians in both cities played the frame drum at a fast pace to accompany festivals, funerals, or weddings. While initially marginal in mainstream Indian film music, where a light classical, tabla-focused style of pop dominated, by the turn of the millennium the genre had established itself in the industry, setting the scene for every wannabe blockbuster’s most lavish musical number.\n\nKuthu music is at the heart of “Naatu Naatu,” and the song can’t be truly understood without it. The genre’s distinctive triplet-heavy, 6/8 rhythm; the crisp sound of the parai (Tamil) or daf (Telugu) frame drum; the layered effect created by a half-dozen drummers playing simultaneously: they’re all on display to spectacular effect in the track. The other nine songs below tell the story of the genre in both Tamil-language Kollywood and Telugu-language Tollywood, a story that reflects the themes RRR dramatizes: Eastern vs. Western, high class vs. low class, urban vs. rural.\n\nIlaiyaraaja: “Hey Aatha” from Payanangal Mudivathillai (1982)\n\nThe composer Ilaiyaraaja is widely credited with popularizing the use of folk music in Tamil cinema, kuthu included. Though he had a deep knowledge of Carnatic music, his tastes were famously wide-ranging: he pioneered psychedelic rock in Tamil film music in the ’70s, and his experiments with computers would introduce digital production to Kollywood in the ’80s. Ilaiyaraaja was born into a Dalit family in rural Tamil Nadu, a background that made folksy drums like the parai and urumee familiar to him. Even his earliest film songs, like 1976’s “Kettele Ange,” incorporated the parai drum into classically-influenced film pop, a gesture controversial enough to get the song banned from India’s national radio station.\n\n“Hey Aatha” (roughly “Hey Girl”) is a good example of how Ilaiyaraaja and other early kuthu pioneers tackled the genre: adding it as a brief, rhythmic element to spice up songs that were, at a fundamental level, a classical composition. The song appears in Payanangal Mudivathillai accompanied by very early footage of the most iconic kuthu dance step: street children grooving to the triplet rhythm by thrusting their elbows in front of them, while kicking their legs behind them.\n\nDeva: “Laalaku Dole” from Surieyan (1992)\n\nDeva was the dominant film composer in Kollywood in the ’90s. He drew upon the underground, working-class musical genre of gaana, a style that dispensed with classical Indian music’s famously ornate melodies in favor of a direct, repetitive cadence often compared to rap music. Deva, who grew up listening to gaana, started incorporating the genre into his work as early as “Laalaku Dole,” and it would heavily feature in his music from there on out.\n\n“Laalaku Dole” in its film appearance is sung by lumberjacks—appropriate for the gritty themes of gaana. Deva anchors the beat to the parai drum, which plays a crisp triplet pattern at various points in the song. Gaana like “Laalaku Dole” is the direct ancestor of contemporary kuthu pop, but it’s not quite there yet: classically influenced tabla flourishes still appear on occasion, vestiges of Ilaiyaraaja’s approach to folk music.\n\nR. P. Patnaik: “Gaajuvaka Pilla” from Nuvvu Nenu (2001)\n\nThe Telugu film industry has always maintained a close relationship with its sister cinema to the south. Ilaiyaraaja would regularly cross the border to work in both languages. Kollywood plots would be swiped for Tollywood plots (and vice-versa), Tamil songs would be surreptitiously converted into their Telugu equivalent (also vice-versa).\n\nKuthu pop spread in Telugu via these channels, with Tollywood calling the sound “teenmaar,” the name of a military-band drumming tradition in Hyderabad, so-called because the bands stuffed three types of sound into every beat. The genre hybridized within its new context: teenmaar replaced the parai drum, a specifically Tamil instrument, with the daf, a frame drum that was brought to Hyderabad hundreds of years ago by immigrants from Yemen.\n\nThat isn’t to imply that Tollywood was any less creative than Kollywood. “Gaajuvaka Pilla” (“Gajuwaka Girl”) pushes the genre forward, paring away the classical flourishes of Deva and Ilaiyaraaja for a more raw, hip-hop inflected feel. It went on to become a hit in Tamil Nadu as well, when the 2003 song “Thiruvizhannu Vantha” copied its arrangement and melody.\n\nVidyasagar: “Appadi Podu” from Ghilli (2004)\n\nKuthu, in its original form, is a purely instrumental genre, which posed a problem for its incorporation into film music, which always put vocals front and center. Ilaiyaraaja’s attempts to merge classical singing with kuthu were awkward; it wasn’t until the early 2000s that producers finally got the mix right. The big innovation that composers of Vidyasagar’s generation introduced was pairing the staccato vocal stylings of Deva’s gaana music with a sped-up version of a kuthu rhythm. In “Appadi Podu” (an expression equivalent to “yay, woo-hoo!”), each syllable of the chorus fits snugly in the pocket of the beat, while the melody stays within a limited range. This style was widely popular in the early 2000s and, even up to the present, remains the foundation of modern kuthu pop.\n\nM.I.A.: “Bird Flu” (2006)\n\nNever one to miss an emerging global sound, M.I.A. incorporated kuthu into her classic 2007 album Kala—twice. On “Boyz,” M.I.A. overlays kuthu percussion on top of a dancehall track, but it’s on “Bird Flu” that M.I.A. goes full Kollywood. The track’s drums are sampled from “Thirvizhannu Vantha,” the Tamil adaptation of “Gaajuvaka Pilla,” while the squawking horns are a play on the reedy sound of the Tamil instrument nadaswaram.\n\nThe song’s connection to Hyderabad through “Gaajuvaka Pilla” resonates with Kala’s larger theme of global solidarity and cultural transmission. The daf drums used in Telugu teenmaar music are associated with the Siddi people, a Black community in the city that initially arrived there from East Africa as part of the Arab slave trade. Coincidentally (or not), both East African and South Indian percussion have a strong tendency towards triplet rhythms and 6/8 time. M.I.A. would continue to investigate these connections between South Indian and African music in her later work.\n\nVijay Anthony: “Naaka Mukka” from Kadhalil Vizhunthen (2008)\n\nIf “Appadi Podu” represents the birth of modern kuthu pop, Vijay Anthony’s “Naaka Mukka” (literally “Tongue Nose”) represents the genre’s maturity. Though it dropped only four years after its predecessor, the rap-like flow of the vocals is smoother, and the percussion is more complex. Composer Vijay Anthony adds traditional parai drum flourishes that most pop kuthu songs omit, which add a whiff of the streets back into an increasingly formalized genre.\n\n“Naaka Mukka” was released in “Male” and “Female” versions, with different singers. The latter stands out thanks to a stellar performance by Chinnaponnu, who dramatically rolls her R’s and sings from her chest to match the intensity of the beat. Every element in the track adds up to an incredible whole, and “Naaka Mukka” remains a demonstration of the best kuthu has to offer.\n\nSajid–Wajid: “Aa Re Pritam Pyaare” from Rowdy Rathore (2012)\n\nAfter the kuthu song conquered Kollywood and Tollywood, it started to make waves in Bollywood. Of course, “Aa Re Pritam Pyaare”(“Come Here Sweetheart”) copies an older Tamil song, “Vaadi Vaadi” (theft is the traditional method of cultural exchange in the subcontinent). The weirdest thing about “Pritam Pyaare” is that, despite its obvious South Indian sound, the film version of it opts for a vaguely Rajasthani aesthetic, with nary a reference to the Deccan. As kuthu pop spreads, it loses its connections to any specific location, like the streets of Chennai, and comes to stand in for folksy, non-elite culture. Still, the success of “Pritam Pyaare” and other kuthu songs in Hindi paved the way for South Indian cinema to find success outside of its home turf.\n\nAnirudh: “Sodakku” from Thaanaa Serndha Koottam (2018)\n\nBy the 2010s, kuthu had firmly established itself as the dominant genre of South Indian dance music. Rather than using funk and hip-hop flourishes to make kuthu more trendy, millennial producers like Anirudh do the opposite, adding kuthu to EDM to translate it for local dance floors. Here, Anirudh borrows the wait-drop structure of big-tent EDM to thrilling effect: the drop hits you with a blast of furious folk drumming alongside the boom-boom-boom. Across Anirudh’s work, from his viral breakout “Why This Kolaveri Di?” to his mature rave style in “Vaathi Coming,” Western sounds are carefully paired with traditional Tamil percussion. In “Sodakku” (“Snapping”), Anirudh reinvigorates two tired sounds—the parai drum pattern and the synth wub—making it feel as if you were listening to a big meaty drop for the first time again.\n\nA. R. Rahman: “Verithanam” from Bigil (2019)\n\nAnirudh’s music tests the flexibility of kuthu pop, but A. R. Rahman, Indian pop maestro and composer of Slumdog Millionaire mega-hit “Jai Ho,” stretches it to the breaking point. Rahman began his career as an assistant to Ilaiyaraaja back in the ’90s, and he preserves his teacher’s eclectic spirit throughout his work. In “Verithanam” (“Frenzy”), Rahman re-introduces some of the experimentation and funkiness the genre lost after the Deva era, with frequent beat switch-ups, abrupt transitions into different vocalists, genres, and samples, and a large children’s orchestra at the end—because at that point, why not?\n\nThe track’s indulgent production demonstrates that kuthu is no longer the scrappy genre it once was, associated with village folk and the poor. It is extravagant and indulgent as any other genre of Indian film pop; it is epic in scope, promiscuous in sound, and just perfect for painstakingly choreographed scenes with hundreds of simultaneous dancers.\n\nM. M. Keeravani: “Naatu Naatu” from RRR (2022)\n\n“Naatu Naatu” (“Dance Dance”) is enriched by the complex history of kuthu and teenmaar. After all, the track features two Indian men—one rural, one urban; one low caste, one high caste; one rich, one poor—getting down to a beat that has always grappled with the tension between those extremes. The genre’s newly pan-Indian musical presence allows the song to stand in for Indianness in general, its three-beat core offering a sharp contrast to the uptight British waltz that precedes it. Top Tollywood composer Keeravani clearly crafted “Naatu Naatu” to be a nationwide hit, but no one could have foreseen a song like this making the impact it did in the West. From its humble roots in Chennai and Hyderabad, the genre has only grown outward and outward. Perhaps a new, international chapter of kuthu and teenmaar is right around the corner."
