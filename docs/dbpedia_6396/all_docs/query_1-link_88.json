        "text": "Between completing school exams, juggling full-time jobs and looking after their families, this year’s YWCA Y25 are a shining example of the power of fighting for what you believe in.\n\nIllustrations by Pounamu Wharekawa.\n\nEvery year, the pool of nominees for the Y25 grows bigger and stronger. Four years since its inception, the Y25 has championed the mahi of 75 young wāhine and iarere changemakers so far, and the team at YWCA are ready to introduce you to the next group.\n\nThis year’s Y25 come from all across Aotearoa. Their mahi spans advocacy for children in state care, LGBTQIA+ activism, indigenous storytelling, entrepreneurship, disability access championing, creative pursuits and more.\n\nYWCA CEO Dellwyn Stuart says the group shows us what’s possible for the future of Aotearoa.\n\n“Aotearoa has an abundance of remarkable leaders already shaping their communities and our future… Together they demonstrate the diversity of experience that growing up in Aotearoa is today.”\n\nFrom more than 100 nominations, the final 25 were selected for their vision, their leadership and their impact – whether far-reaching or community focused.\n\n“Bringing together 25 wahine and irarere, that’s political, that’s a statement of intent of what we’re trying to achieve in the world – shifting power and changing systems through collective solidarity.” – Hannah Huggan, Y25 Co-design 2022.\n\nMeet the 2023 Y25 below:\n\nAllyssa Verner Pula, 22, researcher, podcast host & MVPFAFF+ champion, Tāmaki Makaurau/Auckland (she/her)\n\nVerner Pula is a proud Samoan woman who runs the “Mayor of Manurewa” blog and podcast, “Island Roots, Auckland Ways”. She cares deeply about her community and believes that Aotearoa can value Pasifika communities better – especially our Pasifika women and Rainbow communities.
