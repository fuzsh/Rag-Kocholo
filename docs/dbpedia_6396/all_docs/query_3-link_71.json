Classical and folk forms of Indian music use raga melodic forms, tal (rhythmic forms) and drones (sustained notes). Ragas are patterns of notes but they are different to the scales used in Western cultures. Common instruments include: Bansuri, Sitar, Sarangi, Sarod, Esraj, tanpura, harmonium and the tabla drums.\n\nModern Indian music blends the traditional classical and folk styles with the influence of electronic dance music.\n\nWhat is Bhangra music?\n\nBhangra was originally a type of folk dance music from Punjab in India. Workers in the fields would sing songs to the rhythm of the dhol drum. These songs were used to celebrate annual events, such as the harvest, and many of the song movements refer to field workers collecting the crops. - BBC\n\nModern Bhangra music is a mix of this traditional music style with modern electronic dance music production techniques. It creates a highly energetic form of dance music popular all over the world. It's exciting rhythmic structure is appealing to listen and makes an excellent style of dance music.\n\nWhat is Bollywood music?\n\nBollywood songs, more formally known as Hindi Geet or filmi songs, are songs featured in Bollywood films.\n\nWhile the term 'Bollywood music' can be applied to all music that is used in Bollywood films (Indian Cinema) its predominant style is that of romantic love songs played with a mix of modern and traditional instruments, often with highly dramatic overtones.\n\nâ"
