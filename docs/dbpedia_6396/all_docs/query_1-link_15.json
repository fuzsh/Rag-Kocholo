Keep them coming members i like it and i want to hear more!\n\nRegards George18\n\nPost by S on\n\nNo women singers cos they're all crap? Are u tryna tell me Gunjan is crap? Sheesh get your ears washed out lol!!\n\nGurdas Mann defo a LEGEND, and Gunjan is one of my favourite singers too! But I gota say one of my favourite female Punjabi singer is Jaspinder Narula.\n\nPost by || M a s t e r K u n a l || on\n\nWell i think Karan MC has one of the most powerful voice which stands out from the rest and his songs realy gets the crowd on the dance floor.. Do look out for his fourthcoming albums, as i myself feature on it as a vocalist. My song is called Mil Pa Ranjahna and the album is Official Desi Vol.1.. Look out 4 the vids on ZMusic aswel.. Master Kunal.\n\nPost by devraj on\n\nWell id have to say Gurdaas Mann and Malkit Singh are def up there somewhere. But till now also Lembher. He has a great voice on him, hence why hes on so many songs.\n\nKuldip Manak is sick aswell\n\nPost by || M a s t e r K u n a l || on\n\nmasterkunal said:\n\nWell i think Karan MC has one of the most powerful voice which stands out from the rest and his songs realy gets the crowd on the dance floor..\n\nDo look out for his fourthcoming albums, as i myself feature on it as a vocalist.

Karan MC is the olnly singer to ever have a voice quality as close to Kuldip Manak than any other punjabi singer..\n\nPost by sui9f4j9f34 on\n\nFor me its gotta be Gurdas Mann and Surjit Bindrakhia but i think Chamkila would have definitely been up there with these 2 if he didnt pass away when he did cos i think he was only 26 when he passed away.\n\nPost by george18 on\n\nWell i think Karan MC has one of the most powerful voice which stands out from the rest and his songs realy gets the crowd on the dance floor..\n\nDo look out for his fourthcoming albums, as i myself feature on it as a vocalist.

Karan MC is the olnly singer to ever have a voice quality as close to Kuldip Manak than any other punjabi singer..\n\nWOT THE FCUK!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!\n\nYh he has a phat voice i admit that but there is no way he compares to Kuldip Manak! I dont think you realise how bad Manak is!!!! Not many people can do what Kuldip Manak did.\n\nBut thier are many good singers such as Balkar Sidhu, Akashdeep, peeps like these are phat now but back in da day it woz manz lyke Shinda, Manak, Yamla, Chamkilla, Bindrakhia\n\nPost by || M a s t e r K u n a l || on\n\nOh n is that y all of Kuldip Manak's writers/ lyricists have given all copyrights of his songs to be sung by Karan MC!! Which is true, writers such as Dev Tarikeywala, one of Manak's favourite has honoured MC for his singing style such as with Manak's. He's probably not the greatest singer of all time YET but he surely will be remembered for years to come.. & all u people know he is much better than Manak E!!!"
