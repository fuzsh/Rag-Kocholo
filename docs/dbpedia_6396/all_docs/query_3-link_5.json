        "text": "Indian music, with its rich and diverse heritage, has evolved over thousands of years, reflecting the cultural, social, and spiritual fabric of the Indian subcontinent. Its history can be broadly divided into three periods: Ancient, Medieval, and Modern.\n\nAncient Period (Vedic Era to 6th Century AD)\n\nThe roots of Indian music can be traced back to the Vedic era (c. 1500–500 BCE), when the sacred hymns of the Vedas were chanted during religious ceremonies. The earliest musical text, the Natya Shastra, written by the sage Bharata Muni between 200 BCE and 200 CE, extensively discusses the theory and practice of music, dance, and drama.\n\nDuring this period, Indian music was primarily a form of worship and expression of devotion. The two main styles, Hindustani and Carnatic, began to take shape, with the latter being more closely linked to the Vedic tradition.\n\n2. Medieval Period (7th to 15th Century)\n\nThe medieval period witnessed a significant evolution of Indian music, with the emergence of various regional styles and genres. The influence of Persian music and culture during the Delhi Sultanate (1206–1526) and the Mughal Empire (1526–1858) played a crucial role in shaping Hindustani music.\n\nIn South India, the Bhakti movement (7th-17th centuries) led to the development of the Carnatic tradition, with the creation of devotional songs and hymns by saint-composers like Purandara Dasa, Annamacharya, and Tyagaraja. This period also saw the systematization of raagas and the codification of music theory, with landmark texts such as the Sangita Ratnakara by Sarngadeva (13th century).\n\n3. Modern Period (16th Century to Present)\n\nThe modern period in Indian music is marked by the patronage of royal courts, which fostered the growth of various gharanas (musical lineages) in Hindustani music and the refinement of the Carnatic style. The works of Tansen, a legendary musician in the court of Mughal Emperor Akbar, significantly influenced the development of North Indian classical music.\n\nDuring the British colonial period, Western musical instruments and ideas began to permeate Indian music, leading to new forms and styles such as Indo-Western fusion and the emergence of popular film music. In the post-independence era, Indian music has continued to evolve, with the rise of global collaborations and the incorporation of diverse influences, ranging from jazz and rock to electronic music.\n\nThroughout its history, Indian music has remained a vital means of expression, communication, and cultural identity. With its rich tapestry of raagas, taalas, and genres, it continues to captivate audiences around the world and inspire generations of musicians and listeners."
