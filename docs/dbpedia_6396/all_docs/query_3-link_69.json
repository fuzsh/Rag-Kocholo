        "text": "Western classical and Indian classical violin are very, very different styles. The main similarity is that they use the same instrument, so if you learned one style, you would have a head start learning the other.\n\nSimilarities: For either style, you will need to be familiar with your instrument and learn where to find notes, and how to control the bow.\n\nDifferences: There are a lot more differences than similarities.\n\nHow the instrument is held: In western music, the instrument is held at your neck, and is played either standing or seated in a chair. In Indian classical, it is usually played seated on the floor, with the instrument upright and the bottom of the instrument's body supported by the ground. It would be very, very difficult to switch between these for someone who hasn't extensively practiced both positions.\n\nMusical Theory:\n\nBoth styles use rhythm and pitch as the core of making music, but the details are profoundly different.\n\nThere are differences in how the styles use scales, whether and how they use harmonies, what notes are considered notes, the use of improvisation, in how rhythm is used, and more. These differences are at such a basic level that even a beginner's very first lessons will be very different between the styles.\n\nConclusion: I play western violin, but took a workshop in Indian Classical once. The differences in the music were huge, and I struggled to frame even the basics in my musical understanding. If you know you want to play western music, I'd start by learning that, rather than learning Indian, then changing styles.\n\nIf you can't find a teacher, I'd suggest using looking for a teacher who will teach over the internet, and in the mean time using internet video lessons. ProfessorV on YouTube is a good place to start.\n\nYou can start in Indian or Western classical music. Once you gain proficiency in either you may switch to other with ease. But, again, it depends from person to person. In my opinion your choice will be governed more by the availability teachers, the time you can devote, and most important the place to practice. So for example if you are living in an apartment, and want to practice your instrument, the others may get disturbed. In my very own case, my learning has been very staggered, for many reasons, like teachers got transferred, I got transferred, or plain laziness on my part.\n\nOne thing is sure for whichever style you follow is that you need to develop a musical \"ear\". For that listen to a lot of music, and youtube videos are a great source. If you are interested in western classical try locating videos of Yehudi Menuhin, Itzhak Perlman (Vivaldi RV 356 is my personal favorite), Amadeus Electric (Habanera from Carmen). I am not a violinist. If you want to learn the theory part of Western Classical you may want to refer to \"http://shop.trinitycollege.com/shop/powersearch/powersearch_results.asp?search=theory+of+music+workbooks\". These book are available on flipkart too. These are good for self learning, and you can write exams too. Please have a look at www.earmaster.com also.\n\nFor Hindustani classical theory you may want to refer to \"Rag Parichay\", or alike."
