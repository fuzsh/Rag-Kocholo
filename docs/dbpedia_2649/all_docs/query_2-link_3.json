        "text": "002 Opostega spatulella (Essex Cap)\n\nHas not occurred in the UK since 1955, but it seems to be an irruptive species and it still occurs in widespread countries across Europe, so I guess it could turn up again. Incidentally, one of the the few places it has been recorded in Britain is Southend, Essex (where I live). Unlike other British representatives of this family it has ochreous rather than white forewing ground colour."
