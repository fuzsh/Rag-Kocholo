002 Opostega spatulella (Essex Cap)

Has not occurred in the UK since 1955, but it seems to be an irruptive species and it still occurs in widespread countries across Europe, so I guess it could turn up again. Incidentally, one of the the few places it has been recorded in Britain is Southend, Essex (where I live). Unlike other British representatives of this family it has ochreous rather than white forewing ground colour.
