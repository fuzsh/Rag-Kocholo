        "text": "Will this be another Vijay Friday blockbuster?\n\nVijay, 'Thalapathy' (commander) Vijay for fans, has finally taken the political plunge with the announcement of the name of his party -- Tamilaga Vettri Kazhagam -- on Friday.\n\nApart from his huge box office collections, Vijay is a real-life crowd-puller. Something that Tamil Nadu politics has been missing for some time now.\n\nThe 'Leo' star was hinting at his political entry in the last few audio launches of his movies like 'Mersal' and 'Varisu'.\n\nThe 'Thalapathy' started most of the audio launches with 'kutti kada' (small story). In these stories, he referred to incidents in Tamil Nadu or India and said how situations on the ground need to be bettered for the common man.\n\nWHAT VIJAY SAID ABOUT THE CHIEF MINISTER'S ROLE\n\nIn the 2018 film 'Sarkar', Vijay's character comes close to becoming the chief minister.\n\nHis seriousness about the real-life role of a chief minister is evident from a 2018 conversation.\n\nDuring the audio launch of 'Sarkar', the anchor asked Vijay what would happen if the actor became the chief minister in real life.\n\n\"If I become the chief minister, I will never act,\" answered Vijay, explaining how he saw most political leaders as acting and not doing real work.\n\nA 'SAVIOUR SUPERSTAR' AFTER VIJAYAKANTH\n\nThe Kollywood superstar, Joseph Vijay Chandrasekhar, aka, Vijay, has always portrayed the \"saviour\" image. That is one image that he has stuck to in all his films, never experimenting with it.\n\nThe last big \"saviour\" superstar to enter the Tamil political arena was Vijayakanth. Though Vijayakanth played diverse characters, he initially became a household name because of his \"saviour\" hero image.\n\nIn 2005, Vijayakanth, known to fans as Captain, formed the Desiya Murpokku Dravida Kazhagam (DMDK), which played a crucial role in Tamil politics.\n\nA Centre-Left party, the DMDK, contested all seats in the 2006 Tamil Nadu Assembly elections. Though it won just the seat that Vijayakanth contested for, the DMDK bagged 10 per cent of the votes, which was quite an achievement for a fledgling party.\n\nThe peak of Vijayakanth's political career was in 2011. He contested the Assembly polls in alliance with J Jayalalitha's AIADMK. The DMDK won 29 of the 41 seats it contested. The coalition later unseated the DMK but then fell apart.\n\nVijayakanth's DMDK never rose to that strength again.\n\nTAMIL NADU AND THE SUPERSTAR POLITICIANS\n\nTamil Nadu is replete with examples of superstar politicians, starting with MGR or MG Ramachandran in the 1950s. MGR joined the DMK and went on to form the AIADMK in 1972.\n\nJ Jayalalithaa, another star of the Tamil Nadu cineverse, joined the AIADMK in 1982.\n\nIt is noteworthy that 'Ulaganayagan' (Universal Hero) Kamal Haasan entered politics back in 2017, but has hardly been able to make a major breakthrough by translating his fan base into votes.\n\nKamal Haasan's party, the Makkal Needhi Maiam, contested the Lok Sabha Elections 2019 and the 2021 Tamil Nadu Assembly elections, but didn't find many takers. The Makkal Needhi Maiam drew a blank in both elections.\n\nRajinikanth, probably the greatest Tamil actor, announced his entry into politics in December 2017. However, he shied away and abandoned his political aspirations in December 2020, citing health concerns.\n\nRajinikanth, whose fanbase and popularity leave no doubt, probably the greatest crowd-puller in the state, if not in India, did not truly embrace a full-fledged political life.\n\nSo, in effect, Vijay will be a real superstar in full-fledged politics after Vijayakanth and in almost two decades.\n\nVIJAY BRINGS A PROMISE TO TAMIL POLITICS\n\nVijay's political ambitions have been carefully curated so far. He started his moves with the 'Vijay Makkal Iyakkam' and carried out various pro-people initiatives.\n\nVijay Makkal Iyakkam (Vijay People's Movement), the social welfare organisation, spearheaded by Vijay\" has carried out blood donation camps, supported educational causes and participated in disaster relief efforts since 2009.\n\nVijay clarified that politics is not merely another career for him -- it is a sacred duty for the people.\n\nThis grassroots approach, coupled with outreach to the youth, sought to make an impact among the electorates.\n\nThe Vijay Makkal Iyakkam even supported the Jayalalithaa-led AIADMK alliance during the 2011 Tamil Nadu assembly elections.\n\nTamil Nadu politics is in for a shake-up, no doubt. There is a guaranteed box office revenue for all the movies of the \"saviour\" superstar. Will Vijay bring that guarantee to his politics? One just needs to wait till 2026 for the next Assembly election in Tamil Nadu."
