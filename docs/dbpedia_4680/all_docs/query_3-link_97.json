        "text": "OPENING ILLUSTRATION: Oh man, it's SO good to be back up here preaching to you guys. It's one of my favorite things to do with you guys. Didn't our guest preachers do a great job! Can you guys believe Summer is almost over? Ugh, I've been trying to keep my heart from accepting that fact. Have you ever gone on a trip in the summer where you have all these hopes for the trip - “I've needed this trip SO bad!” and then you get there and EVERY single thing seems to go wrong? Years ago, Jenni and I went to NYC, it was over her birthday and I had one hope for the trip, to get Jenni a cannoli in NYC. So, I found the best cannoli in the city, I researched it and planned this whole sneak attack. We went to pizza with some friends, when Jenni went to the restroom to wash her hands my friends slipped out and I started taking Jen on this little adventure. We walked through the streets of NYC making our way to Little Italy, Jenni kept being like, “what is this” all the anticipation was building. I had checked online and the cannoli shop was open till 10pm and it was 9pm as we started towards the shop. We could see a couple guys standing outside looking like they were shutting down the shop, so I told Jen we had to run over there. I could tell these guys were going to locking up for the night early, so I said, “hey aren't you guys open till 10?” they said, “yeah, but tonight we've got a party to get to.” You know the moment in a Hallmark movie where they guy does some big gesture to show the girl how much he loves her? I knew this was my moment, I said, “look, it's my wife's birthday and we've come all the way from Kansas for the best Cannoli in NYC, can we just slip in and buy one cannoli before you lock up for the night…” The guy looked at me in my flannel and jeans, he paused for a moment and then said, “nah, we gotta get outa here…” Lol, I was crushed! We all know what it's like to have a hope crushed don't we? -hope that girl or guy was going to be the one and say yes and they said no -hope to get offered the job only to not get a call back -hope to get on the last flight home only to have all the seats full Our leadership at the church as been talking about one question over the past few months b “What do we hope for those who come to Harmony” -I don't mean for all 500 of you, I mean you What do I hope God will do in YOUR life through YOUR time at this church. b We are working hard in the background to try and ensure that we are designing what we do in order to answer that question… I don't want you to get to the end of your life or the end of your time here and feel like it was all for nothing - I want things for you! I believe God wants things FOR you! b So, How do we keep you from feeling like the door is shut in your face? How do we help you find those the things God wants for you and start to learn to walk into them? b That's the question we're going to try and answer through this sermon series. Jesus told us very clearly what His hope for you was… Listen Matthew 28:18-20 18 Then Jesus came to them and said, “All authority in heaven and on earth has been given to me. 19 Therefore go and make disciples of all nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit, 20 and teaching them to obey everything I have commanded you. And surely I am with you always, to the very end of the age.” if you went to bible college, when your professor talked about this passage, what they would tell you is the imperative in the verses is to “make disciples”. What Jesus wants for you, what I want for you, is for you to become a fully activated disciple of His. ILLUSTRATION: Over the summer our family got to hang out with my youth pastor and his wife. She started telling my kids stories about me when I was a teen. She said, I always tell everyone that when we would go on vacation that when we got home, Kent would be waiting outside for us… Lol, I guess I was border line stalker.. Ha, but it's because I had found a different way of doing life and I wanted to know everything about it. That's what being a disciple is all about. Listen to what Jesus said about becoming a disciple: Luke 9:23-26 23 Then he said to them all: “Whoever wants to be my disciple must deny themselves and take up their cross daily and follow me. 24 For whoever wants to save their life will lose it, but whoever loses their life for me will save it. 25 What good is it for someone to gain the whole world, and yet lose or forfeit their very self? 26 Whoever is ashamed of me and my words, the Son of Man will be ashamed of them when he comes in his glory and in the glory of the Father and of the holy angels. I know, I know, you've heard this passage before, but have you ever stopped to ask yourself, Why would I have to deny myself and take up my cross daily to be a disciple? b It's the same reason I was at my youth ministers house and sat in his office every day. b Because to learn completely a new way of life, you have to let go - completely - of your old way of life. Do you know how Jesus said, “I tell you the truth, unless you change and become like little children, you will never enter the kingdom of heaven.” Jesus wasn't trying to be cute by saying you have to become like a child. b Jesus was trying to illustrate the quality of the kind of faith it takes to follow Him - an unyielding, complete trust that His way is better If I had to speculates, some of you are holding back from being disciples either because you didn't know it meant learning a completely new way of life or because you knew and weren't willing to step into it. The thing is, when you deny yourself - you say no to your old way of trying to get things done - power, manipulation, and money b and you take up your cross daily - you say yes to the things God calls you to - even the hard things b You find life… What seemed like loss - giving up your old way of doing life, ends up being not giving up, but getting So, I've been thinking, how would I define what a disciple is/does for you? Discipleship is a life spent pursuing life with God b -it is hearing His voice and following it -it is finding your value/self-worth in God rather than what people think of you and what you can accomplish -it is seeking to exalt Him and His Kingdom over protecting yourself and your kingdom (ego and economy) CLOSING ILLUSTRATION: Some of you know that Jenni and I are building a cabin at the gorge to rent, we are doing that as a bit of a retirement play because churches as non-profits don't offer retirement and typically don't pay as much as the business world. Due to all that I've gotten in all these facebook groups for people running airbnb's and buying real-estate. One of the things that has hit me is how much all these people are like sharks when there is blood in the water if there is a deal to be had on real-estate. Literally within hours thousands of people will be commenting on and trying to get a piece of the pie. It reminds me of something Jesus said, He said imagine if you were walking in a field and found out there was a treasure - millions in gold - buried in that field. Wouldn't you go back and sell everything you had to purchase the field? Wouldn't you go after it like a shark in the water with blood? Then Jesus said, this is what the person who finds the Kingdom is like. They sell everything - completely let go of their old way of life to get the new way of life of the Kingdom. For some of you in this room, the most dangerous part of your life is you settled for simply being saved and missed that you were saved to follow the savior. What would it look like for you to orient around learning to hear and discern God's voice? To learn to unwind all the ways you've found value in this world and to entwine with Him or to seek His kingdom above yours and those of this world?\n\nHere is your Pro Wrestling Daily News Report for Wednesday, August 7, 2024.

If you don't know who Matthew West is, he is a singer, songwriter, and storyteller. This website is for the non-profit that he has with his father, a pastor. Matthew and his father encourage people to share their stories. They have various categories of stories. Today, I chose three testimonies from the Anxiety/Depression Category. I know so many people who are struggling with anxiety and depression right now. Suicide seems like it is increasing as well. Often, we can hear our own story in someone else's story. When we listen to others tell their story, it helps us see that we are not alone. When we hear how God worked in their situation, it gives us hope that He will work in ours, too! I pray when you hear these testimonies, you get the faith and hope to believe that miracles can happen in your situation also. I pray you know that God is there with you, and if you invite Him into your anxiety and depression, He can help.Jenna: I grew up in a Christian family. We went to church every Sunday and Wednesday and were a part of almost everything; Awana, Elevate teen group, and even school there. Two and a half years ago, I lost someone who I was close to because she felt the need to commit suicide. I was heartbroken and I felt like I lost everything. 2022 was a challenging year for me. I had daily panic attacks and felt like I was worthless. My eating habits went down significantly, and I was stressed all the time. As exams neared, I was super stressed and ended up passing out.Months passed and I still felt worthless. I planned to commit suicide when I got a text from a friend, and it was like a text from God. She said she heard I was going to camp and hoped to see me there. I thought if I waited til after camp, and then committed suicide it would be okay. So I went to camp and it changed my life. I met so many new people and was able to share my hurt with my church and they told me that I was not alone. Camp was my blue couch moment as I sat there in service Thursday night, I realized that I needed God in my life more than ever. I had already been saved, but I realized I hadn't been living like Christ wanted me to.Around late February early March, my friend introduced me to someone…we immediately hit it off and became great friends. A month or two later, it was revealed that he liked me. We started dating in June and have been together ever since. I tell you that little story because sometimes when you need it most, God has someone in mind who will help you grow in faith and support you through it all. They can also help you overcome the hardships in your life.I still deal with anxiety and eating habits, but they have gotten so much better since camp and I am so thankful for all that my church has done for me. Also, I have my three closest friends with me right by my side and the Lord has blessed me with an amazing boyfriend who I love and who has helped me through a lot.GOD'S NOT DONE WITH YOU OR YOUR STORY! HE STILL CARES A LOT AND WILL NEVER LEAVE YOU. YOU HAVE A PURPOSE – TURN TO GOD TO FIND THAT PURPOSE AND YOU WILL BE FOUND.Brianna: From the age of 10, I was stuck with the label “child prodigy,” winning piano competitions, featured in local newspapers, and recognized as a passionate, fiery recitalist. Yet, even as a youth, I was severely depressed. I was insecure, seeking affection, and perpetually in pursuit of attaining “good enough.” Right before my 16th birthday, my world suddenly turned upside down. In an unexpected turn of events, I faced a close encounter with death, had my innocence taken, and watched helplessly as my mother's health began to rapidly fail. Too ashamed to ask for help and blaming myself for the situation, I despairingly turned to self-harm, eating disorders, and eventually, planned my own suicide. One day, I heard the song ‘Broken Pieces', and I found something onto which I could cling to – Truth, even when I could not feel it and it failed to make sense.Through involvement with an organization called Csehy Summer School of Music, I came to personally know Christ. For the first time in my life, I experienced peace, hope, and true joy. Dedicating my life to God, I went back home with a different perspective. My life was still intense – balancing high school and conservatory studies, living between home and the hospital, while being a full-time caretaker for my undiagnosed mother. By the grace of God, I managed to graduate as Salutatorian and get accepted into music school. However, shortly before college began, my mother passed away.I started my B.A. in piano at Charleston Southern University, using every spare moment to pour my heart out into the keys as a wordless prayer. Yet, a lingering pain in my right hand soon became constant. A few months after my mother's funeral, I was diagnosed with severe damage in my right hand, incited by the physical strains from being a caretaker. The only option left was surgery, followed by excruciating therapy, without guarantee of returning to the keys. My doctor strongly advised me to quit and choose a different career path. But I fought back.Over the next several years, I fought through recovery – from both surgical and emotional scars. I realized that though I had given my life to Christ, I hadn't fully “surrendered” it. In those precious years of undergrad, I experienced the freedom found in surrendering to the grace of God, the beauty of vulnerability, and the power of learning to fly again.Then, nearly four years to the day the doctor said it was over, I found myself sitting onstage, performing at Carnegie Hall. When I turned to the audience to see a standing ovation, I burst into tears, because I remembered the words, “With You I can attack a barrier, and with my God I can leap over a wall.”-Psalm 18:29Today, despite the formalities infused in classical music, I get to use the concert stage as a platform to share my story and encourage others to seek help and experience the peace of God. I perform and travel internationally as a soloist and chamber musician, frequently being sought after to premiere avant-garde piano works, and I am actively involved in youth and collegiate ministry. Although healing is an ongoing process, by the hand of God's work in my life, the label of “Victim” has been replaced with “Victorious,” “Hopeless” has been covered by “Confidence,” and what was “Impossible” is now a living, breathing, walking “Miracle.”Bubby: Hey, I just wanted to thank Matthew for his book, “Hello My Name Is” and for all he does for us! I've met him a handful of times and he is such an awesome child of God. On page 58, I believe, he talks about the story of the 11-year-old who asked for the hug and shared about his anxiety. It took me back to my childhood. I didn't come to faith until I was 14. A man!! (Lol. I thought…) But I can remember being 5-10 and suffering through anxiety and panic issues every night and throughout the day. I won't go into it, but it was messed up. Family life was messed up. When I read how this little boy thinking of God holding him when listening to Matt's song, it brought tears to my eyes. I'm 58 and still have memories of my childhood that can hurt if I dwell in them, but I very seldom do…only when things like reading or seeing or hearing someone else's experiences. I looked back at how God was there for me all along even though I was not His child yet. His love is so totally encompassing!! It fills every void in my soul. At 12 I was prescribed some medicine that helped, but it was addictive, and when my mom took me off them abruptly, I turned to drinking and drugging heavier then I had already started a year or so earlier. It was a long road I went through, but thank God, I will have 19 years of sobriety this month. My name is “Saved,” in so many ways.Thank you all for sharing your stories with the world. It can be hard to be vulnerable and talk about the hard things we have gone through.Yet when you are brave and do it even when its hard then we help others who are suffering know that it is ok for them to talk about it too! I am so grateful God saved each of you and thank you again for sharing your story! www.findingtruenorthcoaching.comCLICK HERE TO DONATECLICK HERE to sign up for Mentoring CLICK HERE to sign up for Daily \"Word from the Lord\" emailsCLICK HERE to sign up for free audio training about inviting Jesus into your daily lifeCLICK HERE to buy my book Total Trust in God's Safe Embrace"
