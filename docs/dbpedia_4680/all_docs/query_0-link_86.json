        "text": "18 November 2008\n\nSOURCE: International Federation of Journalists (IFJ), Brussels\n\nThe International Federation of Journalists (IFJ) welcomes an indictment\n\nissued by the High Court in Colombo, Sri Lanka, against Labour Minister\n\nMervyn Silva and three others accused of alleged violence against\n\njournalists.\n\nHowever, the IFJ joins its affiliate, the Free Media Movement (FMM), in\n\ncalling for the Minister to be stood down from his position until the\n\nconclusion of the case.\n\nAccording to the FMM, Silva is indicted on nine counts of unlawful\n\nassembly, mischief, robbery and assault involving Sirasa TV journalists at\n\nPeliyagoda on August 4.\n\nThe others similarly accused are Dulan Hettiarachchi, Prasanna Ranaweera\n\nand Nihal Chandrawansa (alias Manchi Nihal).\n\nOne charge relates to the alleged confiscation of videotapes from Sirasa TV\n\njournalists Waruna Sampath and Saliya Ranawaka as they reported on a\n\ncommunity event.\n\nThe remaining charges concern allegations that the four stole money from\n\nthe journalists, damaged the journalists’ cameras and assaulted Sampath.\n\n“The IFJ is pleased that the allegations against Mervyn Silva will be dealt\n\nwith through the legal system,” IFJ Asia-Pacific said.\n\n“However, such serious charges against a Minister of the Government require\n\nthat he be stood down from his ministerial position while the case is being\n\ndealt with by the courts.”\n\nThe IFJ represents over 600,000 journalists in 120 countries worldwide.\n\nWriter’s Trial:\n\nNov 16, 2008 (LBO) – A Sri Lankan journalist who had been detained for over eight months had been questioned about what he wrote, and had also revealed to court that he had been repeatedly threatened, a media report said.\n\nSenior journalist J S Tissainayagam’s case had been taken up Friday in Colombo High Court but the judicial medical officer summoned to give evidence was not present, The Sunday Times newspaper reported.\n\nEarlier in the week Tissainayagam had testified that he had a serious eye condition, where an accident when he was 18 had caused a detached retina in both eyes and he had 50 percent vision.\n\nDoctors had advised him that a blow to the head could make the condition recur.\n\nHe said officers of Sri Lanka’s terrorist investigation division who was holding him had threatened him saying he would be “beaten up like other detainees” and that he would go blind if the officers beat him, the report said.\n\nHe said he was threatened on a daily basis.\n\nIn cross-examination, a government lawyer had produced several documents and statements that. Tissainayagam was said to have signed on March 7, the day he was detained.\n\nTissainayagam had denied that it was his signature on the documents, saying he signed in the English language and therefore the signature on the documents could not be his.\n\nTissainayagam had told court on May 9 after he had seen another arrested colleague being tortured, and had been told the same would happen to him. The prosecution’s position was that he was lying, the report said.\n\nThe defence had asked for a medical officer who had reported on it to be called to court.\n\nA government lawyer had questioned whether he had visited a Tamil Tiger controlled area with the permission of the Government and questioned him on an article he had written in November 2007 and asked him to read out portions of it.\n\nTissainayagam had read out the article and said he stood by it and added that as a journalist he had expressed his views, The Sunday Times said.\n\nThe International Federation of Journalists (IFJ) had launched a campaign to free Tissainayagam saying it was a trial on the freedom of expression.\n\nDate: 1st November, 2008\n\nRIGHT TO REPLY\n\n(an edited version of a letter sent by EPDP on FMM press release on 29th Oct 2008 titiled\n\nIndependent media in Jaffna threatened by armed cadre of EPDP)\n\nThe EPDP states in all faith and with full consideration for the dignity of its statesman-leader Hon. Douglas Devananda, that the attempts made by the said Saravanabhavan to mislead the FMM, distort the media, damage democracy, and pervert the truth are the strivings of a terrorist accessory, and the EPDP is constrained to repudiate the allegations in the FMM statement as irresponsible and breaching the borders of accuracy.\n\nLet it be known that Hon. Douglas Devananda, statesman-leader of the EPDP, has nothing to do with the said Saravanapavan, and has not had any contact with him since longer than anybody can remember. How then could he have possibly told S.Saravanapavan that the army was “very angry” with him? However, Subra’s brother-in-law and editor of his newspaper, is not queasy about calling the statesman-leader for certain favours and clarifications.\n\nThe reference to a threat last January, is a piece of low-tariff theatre stage-managed by Saravanabhavan who has also accused the EPDP of embargoing newsprint supplies to the peninsula to prevent news from being published there. This is wastebasket nonsense. Newsprint is readily available and newspapers are freely published in Jaffna.\n\nThe EPDP disaffirms any connection with an incident the FMM cites quoting Reporters Sans Frontiers (RSF).\n\nThe EPDP records with regret that while its statesman-leader Hon. Douglas Devananda has personally invited, and repeatedly renewed his invitation to the FMM to speak with him for information and clarification on issues bearing on the EPDP, the FMM has chosen to ignore these invitations and assumed an attitude of intransigent bias in its references to the EPDP.\n\nIn the cause of free and fair media, and for the sake of FMM credibility, the EPDP invites contact from all those interested on +94 – 11-2503467, its 24 hour hotline.\n\nMedia Secretary\n\n(Sunday Times 16th Nov)\n\nWhen the case of senior journalist J. S. Tissainayagam who has been detained for more than eight months was taken up last Friday in the Colombo High Court, the Judicial Medical Officer summoned to give evidence in the case was not present.\n\nSummons was re-issued on the JMO to be present when the case is next taken up on Tuesday.\n\nEarlier in the week the testimony of Mr. Tissainayagam was concluded. Mr. Tissainayagam testified that he had a serious eye condition. He said that he had degenerative myopia from the age of seven and a serious accident when he was 18 led him to have detached retina in both eyes.\n\nHe said after the operation he had only about 50% vision in both eyes and that doctors had advised him to be very careful that any sudden movement or fall or blow to the head could make the condition recur and he could lose his eyesight. Mr. Tissainayagam said had informed the Terrorist Investigation Division (TID) officers about his eye condition very early on in his detention.\n\nHe said, however, TID officers had threatened him saying he would be beaten up like the other detainees and therefore he was very afraid that he would go blind if the TID officers did beat him. He said he was threatened on a daily basis.\n\nIn cross-examination, State Counsel produced several documents and statements that Mr. Tissainayagam was said to have signed on March 7, the day he was detained by the TID. Mr. Tissainayagam denied that it was his signature on the documents clearly stating that he signed in the English language and therefore the signature on the documents could not be his.\n\nState Counsel also questioned him as to whether he had visited the Wanni with the permission of the Government. Mr. Tissainayagam answered in the affirmative that he had visited the Wanni as a journalist. The State also questioned him on articles he had written in November 2007 after LTTE political head S. P. Thamilselvan’s death and asked him to read out portions of the article. Mr. Tissainayagam did read out his article and he said he stood by it and added as a journalist he had expressed his views.\n\nMr. Tissainayagam also said that on May 9 after he had seen his colleague Jasikaran being tortured, he had been told the same would happen to him. That was why he wrote down what was dictated to him by a TID officer, he said.\n\nThe prosecution’s position was that Mr. Tissainayagam was lying on this point. However when the defence attempted to mark the JMO’s report detailing Jasikaran’s torture on May 9 the prosecution objected and the objection was sustained. Therefore the defence asked for the JMO who had given the report to be called as a witness. The prosecution then said that it too would be calling other JMOs who had seen Jasikaran.\n\nThe trial will resume on Tuesday. Counsel Anil Silva with M.A. Sumanthiran, Nalin Ladduwahetty and Ms. Charmaine Gunaratne appeared for journalist Tissainayagam. State Counsel Sudarshana de Silva with Miss Samalka Samarasinghe appeared for the TID.\n\nMeanwhile, the International Federation of Journalists (IFJ) had launched a campaign in September to end Mr. Tissainayagam’s detention as it said the case was a trial of the freedom of expression. As a part of that campaign they had produced a video depicting Mr. Tissainayagam going to the Magistrate’s Court and the show of solidarity witnessed outside the Magistrate’s Courts. However two weeks ago the video clip on UTube had been blocked by unknown persons.\n\nReporters Without Borders condemns the government pressure that led to the debate programme “Ira Anduru Pata” being cut short as it was being broadcast live on the evening of 4 November on state TV station Rupavahini. It ended a discussion of a new broadcasting law by three guests, including Free Media Movement convener Uvindu Kurukulasuriya.\n\nThe presenter announced a break for advertisements after 45 minutes, but the rest of the programme, which normally lasts two hours, was suppressed. Kurukulasuriya had been criticising the government’s media policies before he was censored. It was the first time in nine years that this press freedom activist was invited to speak on Rupavahini.\n\nThis censorship came as widespread criticism forced the government to retreat on its newly-introduced Private Television Broadcasting Station Regulations. After receiving representatives of journalists’ organisations and media owners, media and information minister Anura Priyadharshana Yapa announced that implementation of the new regulations would be suspended for a month, and he gave the media two weeks to submit their proposals for amendments.\n\nFour people, including Kurukulasuriya as FMM representative, filed a petition before the supreme court challenging the regulations, which were published in the official gazette on 10 October without any form of prior consultation. The new rules would restrict development of privately-owned TV by increasing the government’s control over the issuing and withdrawal of broadcasting licences, which would have to be renewed annually.\n\nNoting the government’s decision to suspend the regulations, Reporters Without Borders said: “This law is extremely dangerous for media freedom. Delaying its implementation is not enough. Its content needs to be changed radically.”\n\nReporters Without Borders defends imprisoned journalists and press freedom throughout the world. It has nine national sections (Austria, Belgium, Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Spain, Sweden and Switzerland). It has representatives in Bangkok, London, New York, Tokyo and Washington. And it has more than 120 correspondents worldwide.\n\nBy T. Farook Thajudeen\n\nSenior Journalist Jeyaprakash Sittampalam Tissainayagam testified before Colombo High Court Judge Ms. Deepali Wijesundera in the inquiry to ascertain whether the confession made by him to the Terrorist Investigation Division (TID) was a voluntarily one or made under pressure and threat.\n\nThe witness examined by his counsel Anil Silva said on Wednesday (5), said that he arrived at the TID on the March 7 to visit his friend Jasiharan and his wife, who had been taken into custody the previous day.\n\nHe was allowed inside after having waited for around an hour. Once he got inside the TID premises, a police officer had grabbed the mobile phone he was carrying. When Tissainayagam had asked for the mobile phone back he was told ‘you are now inside the TID, it is not for you to ask for your phone back, but your job instead should be to get out of this place’\n\nLater he was taken to the section head Inspector Janakantha’s room at which time he was questioned on how he knew Jasiharan.\n\nTissainayagam had at this point requested for a lawyer at which Janakantha had laughed. Afterwards OIC Prasanna De Alwis questioned him. Once again, he (Tissainayagam) had requested to have a lawyer to be present to which the OIC had replied ‘we are showing you respect by offering you a chair to sit on. Don’t take advantage of this treatment’.\n\nDirector TID Nandana Munasinghe, while talking to Tissainayagam, referred to his friendship with the journalist Sivaram. Mr. Munasinghe specifically reminded of the way that Sivaram met his death – his body was later discovered in some bushes in close proximity to the Parliament premises. He had been alarmed at this line of questioning, as he did not understand what was meant by it.\n\nFurther questioning was carried out by OIC Prasanna De Alwis and Zubair of the TID. At one point, Tissainayagam said Zubair had walked in while the questioning was going on and had stated that if he (Tissainayagam) continues to lie in this manner he would slap him across the face so that one ear would come out of the other side.\n\nTissainayagam said on May 9th he was threatened by Sergeant Razik, telling him that what happened to Jasiharan that morning would happen to him. He said that he had seen Jasiharan crying in the OIC’s room that morning and later seen him with a swollen face and bloodshot eyes. Razik then dictated a statement that Tissainayagam wrote in his own handwriting.\n\nHe said he was examined by several JMOs in their offices and he never mentioned to them about the assaults or the mental stress he underwent because during the medical examinations by the JMOs the TID officers used to wait out side the JMO’s office and the office had swing doors.\n\nHe said he was unaware of certain clauses in the affidavit signed by him, which was submitted to Supreme Court with his FR petition.\n\nCounsel Anil Silva with M.A. Sumanthiran Nalin Ladduwahetti and Ms. Sharmaine Gunaratne appeared for Journalist Tissainayagam. State Counsel Sudarshana de Silva with Miss. Samalka Samarasinghe appeared for the TID.\n\nFurther hearing was put off for today."
