        "text": "Elephant is one of the main biological treasures in Sri Lanka, and one of the major tourist attraction reasons for the country. But unfortunately the fate of these wild giants has changed dramatically over the years and now faces the danger of extinction from this enchanted island. Human elephant conflict played the vital role in elephant deaths in Sri Lanka. Sri Lanka’s Wildlife Conservation Department informed that 48 persons and 200 wild elephants died in human–elephant conflicts in the year 2011.The Department said that 75 of the elephants died by shooting, 20 elephants by getting caught in traps laid by farmers and number of elephants getting killed through traps laid with food containers packed with explosives has increased considerably. 15 elephants have died by the recent floods, and 10 have died by train accidents.\n\nThe Government of Sri Lanka has taken many measures to end this human elephant conflict over the years such as placing elephant detention centres, placing electric fences etc. But now the problem seems to continue in a different way as “elephant train conflict”. The number of elephants killed on account of being hit by trains last year is the highest number recorded so far, according to Wildlife Conservation Department’s Elephant Conservation Unit Deputy Director W S K Pathirana.\n\n“Fifteen jumbos, including a number of female elephants and calfs were found dead on rail tracks bordering national parks last year,” he said.\n\n“Overgrown shrubbery that have spread up to railway tracks have been the main cause for these accidents,” he explained.\n\n“The animals face fatal collisions as they get trapped between the shrubbery and steep embankment on either side of the track,” he explained.\n\n“They go in search of food – leaves, twigs, flowers, grass and water at night. Most elephant-train accidents take place during late hours between 6 pm to 5 am,” he added.\n\nTrains that operate cris-crossing through these forest areas with elephant population will have to be upgraded as some of these trains do not have proper horn kits, some do not have headlights, and some do not even have proper speed metres and speed control mechanism. The Wildlife Department has met with Sri Lanka Railway operations to discuss the matters and to take steps to restore these conditions under a joint Trains Hit Mitigation Project to save elephants from fatal collisions before it can turn into a serious train-elephant conflict.\n\nThe Treasury has allocated Rs 200 million to the Wildlife Conservation Department to prevent the increasing number of elephant deaths due to train accidents. The Treasury had released the money on the directives of President Mahinda Rajapaksa who has directed Treasury Secretary P B Jayasundara to lend his fullest co-operation to the project. This is the first time that any government has allocated so much funds to resolve the human-elephant conflict.\n\nSteps will be taken under the project to fill more stones between the sleepers of the tracks to prevent the elephants from getting stuck between them and a 10-mile stretch of track is to be cleared to provide safe passage for the elephant under the project. Elephant Conservation Deputy Director Pathirana said they had discussions with Transport Minister Kumar Welgama about using ‘night vision’ cameras to monitor the movements of elephant herds as the trains wend their way through accident prone areas of the forest.Minister Welgama has agreed to install infra-red night vision to facilitate the process of monitoring elephant movement at night as a pilot project, he said.ation” width=”300″ height=”228″ class=”alignleft size-medium wp-image-3046″ /\n\nThe famous X-Files actress, Hollywood star Gillian Anderson was sued by a disabled Sri Lankan Army Captain. The disable army captain Anura Ratne Bandara of Yakkala is the caretaker of the property belongs to the Hollywood star. The army captain had filed a case at the Colombo Commercial High Court against Ms. Anderson and her husband claiming Rs.100 million as compensation. According to the case filed at the Commercial High Court American Actress Gillian Anderson, Mark Griffiths (the husband of Ms. Anderson) and L.G. Senaratne had been named as defendants.\n\nThis believes to be the latest situation of an ongoing conflict between the two parties since December last year. The police have arrested the army captain Anura Bandara on 29th December 2011, following allegations of fraud. He was remanded in custody following a complaint that he misappropriated up to 17.8 million rupees ($154,000) from the X-Files star’s property at Pasyala, a village outside Colombo.\n\n“We arrested the man following a complaint that he criminally misappropriated funds entrusted to him to manage the property,” police spokesman Ajith Rohana said.\n\nHe said investigations were under way and a magistrate ordered the suspect to be held until January 4 to allow police more time to complete their investigations. Police also alleged that initial inquiries showed that he had taken away a television set from the property. There was no immediate comment from Anderson, who was not in Sri Lanka, or her agents.\n\nThe army captain was appeared before Colombo Fort magistrate Kanishka Wijeratne on 18th January and was remanded for another week despite the Police request for keep the suspect in remand custody for 14 days as the probe was ongoing,\n\nAnura Bandara as the complainant stated that he has offered a yeoman service to the company belongs to the actress, with full commitment to develop the properties. The defendants had also promised him to build a house on his behalf and it was also ignored by them and also was failed to provide all facilities agreed upon the initial contract. Then without a proper reason the defendants had decided to terminate his service as the caretaker of the property.\n\nBut according to the counsel, who appeared on behalf of the property company, told court that the defendants had not received summons in this regard and further informed that the Army captain had been appointed on a contract basis and as such he was not a permanent employee of the company.\n\nThe CID also has gathered information with the help of their detectives regarding the matter and stated that, they have collected evidence from the Ceylon Electricity Board’s Kiribathgoda branch, to confirm that the suspect army captain had obtained Rs.6.8 million for the purpose of supplying electricity to the property and thereby misappropriated one million rupees.\n\nThe Colombo Fort Magistrate Kanishka Wijeratne has postponed the case for January 30.\n\nTwo cricketing giants of Sri Lanka Mahela and Sanga have entered to the Food and Beverages industry with the opening of their new restaurant in Old Dutch Hospital in Fort. “Ministry of Crab” was the unusual name given for this restaurant which dedicated to serve the Sri Lanka’s finest export quality giant crabs to the food lovers of both Sri Lanka and to the rest of the world.\n\nMinistry of Crab – was unveiled by co-owners Mahela Jayawardene and Kumar Sangakkara with Dharshan Munidasa ,the owner of the Japanese restaurant “Nihonbashi”. Dharshan is of mixed Japanese heritage as his mother is Japanese and she is the presenter of the TV show “Culinary Journeys with Dharsan” in ETV, which gained an immense popularity among the high society in Colombo. Mahela Jayawardne is the Chairman of the restaurant who was elected by coin toss, an unorthodox method which may not be followed by other corporate bodies. Mahela and Sanga are not merely the investors of the restaurant who just want to use their PR to promote the business and left the remaining to Dharshan and other staff members. The both of them are keen food lovers while Kumar loves to watch cooking shows on TV, as he admires the unique creativity needed to be a chef – a sort of creativity he feels his friend and co-owner of the restaurant Dharshan is able to provide to Ministry of Crab. Mahela said that the Chicken Curry Rice is one of his major contributions to the menu that Dharshan made for him during the cricket world cup matches played in Sri Lanka; it’s been one of his favorite dishes.\n\nMinistry of Crab menu demonstrates various culinary influences – from Baked Crab, to the Singaporean classic Chili Crab, to our very own Sri Lankan Crab Curry. What’s more the ingredients used at the Ministry of Crab aren’t just the best, but also the freshest; think about it – there is no way these crabs can be served to you as fresh anywhere else in the world, in fact, it employs a no-freezer policy: “the only use we’ve found for freezers is to store our food refuse prior to disposal,” the owners say. Though crabs are undoubtedly the star attraction of Ministry of Crab, the owners will be serving a selection of other dishes, largely based on seafood in addition to alternatives – such as chicken and vegetable dishes.\n\n“Ministry of Crab” Faces Legal Queries\n\nAccording to recent news, this new business may have to face legal problems due to its unusual name. Secretary to the president Lalith Weeratunga has raised a legal point stating that it was totally against the law to use the word ministry for a private business. Only a government ministry or a religious body can use the name ministry according to the existing legal system of the country. According to Mr. Weeratunga, this restaurant has been allowed to use only the name Crab Corporation of Pvt. Ltd. The owners were introduced as “Crab Ministers” in their official web site, while the terms “The Gazette” and “Hanzard”were also used in the site which also may be violation of Parliamentary regulations. The matter was also been informed to the Western Provincial Council by Mr.Weeratunga.\n\nThe latest news revealed that the Hirunika Premachandra’s love affair with Randima Gamage has stopped with mutual agreement. The daughter of the slain political leader Bharatha Lakshman Premachandra has joined the Sri Lanka Mahajana Party recently in a bid to start her political journey. Giving an interview to a week end news paper she has said that;\n\n“After my father’s tragic incident I understood that my political journey going to be a tough one and it would affect our relationship adversely, On the other hand now my main aim and object is to win my father’s case, so that I’m unable to concentrate on anything else.”\n\n“Both Randima and I myself came to a decision to stop our relationship for a while, I don’t know what will happened in the future for the time being we believe that this is the right decision to take.”\n\n‘’ Both of us belong to political families, and now I want to proceed with my father’s political journey as Randima doing so. So we are not rivals, Randima is the only one closed to me beside my father.”\n\nAfter the assassination of her father, gossip media published that she is having an affair with the President’s son Namal Rajapaksha. Hirunika was furious with the website for publishing incorrect information, and took immediate action to boldly posed with her real boy friend for the people to see, via the ITN Rupavahini channel .While showing her boy friend she told the media that her love affair with him is over a 5 year period.\n\nRandima Gamage is a Provincial Council Minister in the Southern province and he took the second highest preferential votes in the Southern Provincial Council election in the year 2009 taking 77,418 votes. Politics is in Randima’s blood as his father Minister Piyasena Gamage has been the Member of Parliament representing this area since 1989.Randima is a product of Royal College Colombo and took his LLB Degree from The University of Buckingham United Kingdom.\n\nHirunika Premachandra has sent a letter to the 28th anniversary ceremony of Sri Lanka Mahajana Party held on February 5th stating that she has taken a crucial decision to follow the footsteps of her father and would be engaged in politics under that party.The late Mr. Premachandra was a founder member of the SLMP with late film star Vijaya Kumaranatunga, which is an affiliate of the ruling UPFA at present.\n\nBut she has also stated that she hasn’t joined active politics as portrayed in the media. “There is a big difference between joining a political party and joining active politics. All I did was taking membership of a political party, which any person in this country can do,” she said. “As I have said many times before I intend on joining active politics in the future, but it’s not something that will happen right now, After the death of my father people started to get to know me, and therefore most of the time every step I take is over scrutinized and given a different turn,” she said.\n\nSri Lanka considered as a Prime destination for tourism over centuries, whether it is Eco Tourism, Agro Tourism, Adventure Tourism, Wild Life Tourism, Nature Tourism or Culture Tourism, Sri Lanka is the most sought after tourism destination in Asia, with Six World Heritage sites and over 25 Bio diversified hot spots under her nest.

Sri Lanka is gifted with abundance of Fauna and flora species and has a tradition of conservation of wild life starting from 3rd century BC. World’s first wild life reserve was declared in the island in 3rd century BC by King Devanampiyatissa. Historical evidences suggest that the killing of animals, within the boundaries of Anuradhapura was prohibited by the king.\n\nThe International Council of Tourism Partners (ICTP) welcomed Sri Lanka as a new destination member.\n\nThe International Council of Tourism Partners (ICTP) welcomed Sri Lanka as a new destination member.

Maha Muhudu Wimane, Egodaha Yanno, Amba Damba Naran, Mihirethi Wasantha Kale, An Hematama Wada, Suwanda Rosa Mal, Kanduluwalin Pem Hasuna Liyannata, Adareta Hadu Dun Tharam, Mee pan dee Ridee Ganna were some of the all-time hits he sung which some of them were originally sung by his father.Sathish staged the Milton,Milton and Shelton musical show with Priyankara Perera and Ranil Mallawarachchi, the three sons singing songs of yesteryear legendary singers.\n\nSathish Perea was a very talented singer, but could not make a name of his own by singing original Sathish Perera songs. It is tragedy face by all the other sons who sing their father’s songs. But there are quite a few who managed to overcome this situation with courageous effort , Amal Perera is a good example for that category. Jayantha and Lelum Ratnayake sons of Victor Ratnayake also refused to sing their father’s songs to build a name in the music field.\n\nAlthough Sathish’s father was an award winning play back singer ( He recived the “Sarasivi” and “Presidential” awards for his song “Budune Budu Piyananae” in “Sasara Chethana” directed by Malini Fonseka) Sathis was not lucky enough to render his voice as a play back singer. Music directors also have neglected this great voice being used for their film songs and Sathish Perera was recognized as an ordinary singer during his short period in the music industry. We at Lanka Help Magazine salute this talented singer and take this opportunity to convey our heart fell condolences to the family members of Sathish Perera.\n\nUpdate : Sathish had been suffering from leukemia and it is the cause of death of this young artist.

An average person who knows about the computer understand the ‘Hard Drive’ ‘Flash Drive’ etc associates with it that use to store data. Google drive does the same but with more sophisticated way as it’s the newest Cloud Storage device introduced to the internet users. A Cloud Storage device is a place you store your files online so that you can access them from anywhere at any time. So it can be referred as your hard drive in the sky. After you run the free Google Drive application, you get a folder on your computer (Windows or OSX) that looks just like a directory on your hard disk that you can drag your files in to. Anything stored in that folder is kept on your hard disk and also copied to your account in the cloud. You can access those files from drive.google.com or from other computers, including mobile devices.\n\nIs Google Drive the first in Cloud Storage device in the net?\n\nThe answer for that question is No. Actually Google is very late to introduce a such facility. In the consumer cloud storage market, there are serious, well-established, and highly valued companies already up and running. Dropbox, box, SugarSync,Cubby,CX, Mozy Stash,Wuala ,Bitcasa,Microsoft Sky Drive and Apple icloud are the pioneers and alternatives to the Google Drive.\n\nWhat will happen to the Google Docs ?\n\nGoogle Drive is also the new name for Google Docs. Google’s suite of Web-based productivity tools such as word processor, spreadsheet, and presentation app and documents you create using these tools will show in your Google Drive from now on.\n\nFiles that you drag into your Google Drive from your hard disk are actually copied to the cloud. They’re also synchronized to your other computers that use Google Drive.\n\nWhat are facilities I get by using the Google Drive?\n\nI. File Synchronization\n\nWhen you do changes to the file that you have stored in the Google Drive it is automatically updated not just in the cloud but on all the other devices that you have connected to the Drive. So you can start working on a file on one computer, close it, and then open it on a second computer, and what you’ll see is the version you closed on the first one.\n\nII. Ability to store any kind of File format or folder\n\nWithin file size and space limits, anything you can store on your hard drive can also be stored in a cloud drive.You can also move entire folders in your Google Drive.\n\nIII. Sharing make easy with coworkers\n\nEarlier you have to email a file or sent it stored in a portable storage device to your coworkers in order to get it reviewed or completed. Now all you have to do is email a link to a file stored on your Drive. All the services let you mark a file or folder for sharing and then invite people to view or download it.\n\nIV. You get 5 GB Free\n\nGoogle will give you 5GB of completely free storage for storing files to use across computers, or to share, or that you need to access on your mobile device. But if you want to store large archives of photos or videos, you can pay for more storage. 25GB is $2.49 a month; 100GB is $4.99 a month.\n\nV. Your Data is safe from hacking as they will be encrypted\n\nGoogle Drive encrypts data between your computer and the Google servers. If you’re using your Drive over the Web, the connection defaults to secure (HTTPS), and when you use the software that makes your Google Drive appear on your computer like a local hard drive, the data between your computer and Google is likewise encrypted. No casual hacker will be able to grab your files by monitoring or intercepting your Internet connection to Google.\n\nVI. Access your files through your Mobile.\n\nGoogle Drive is available on Android. An iPhone app also will be introduced near future. With cloud storage mobile apps, you can see what’s stored in your cloud drive easily, and then download or view files as needed. It won’t use up all your storage the moment you set it up.\n\nWhat are the drawbacks in Google Drive?\n\nFor the time being the files created using Google Docs tools is not stored or copied to your computers. You see in your Google Drive are links to your files. If you open one, it’ll open in the browser-based Google app.\n\nThere is an element of danger associates with file synchronization. If you update a file before your cloud service has sent you the latest version, you can end up with collisions or version conflicts.\n\nYou cannot sync a file that’s buried in a folder on your hard drive without dragging it to the Google Drive.\n\nThe iOS apps aren’t out yet and there’s no news of versions for Windows Phones or BlackBerry.\n\nGoogle Drive doesn’t copy your Google Docs data to your computer, so you cannot access those files when offline.\n\nTelecommunications Regulatory Commission of Sri Lanka (TRCSL) has decided to reallocate the radio frequencies to all the FM radio channels in Sri Lanka from November 01, 2012.
