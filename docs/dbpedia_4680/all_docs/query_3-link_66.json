        "text": "For a state whose actors look at a political calling as their post-interval second innings, 2024 is rather different. Kollywood, it seems, has given the Lok Sabha elections a miss. Barring Radhika Sarath Kumar, who is the BJP candidate from Virudhunagar, no other mainstream actor is trying his or her luck at the hustings this time.\n\nThat's perhaps why all eyes are already on 2026, because that's when superstar Vijay, fondly referred to as 'Thalapathy' (commander) is slated to test the volatile political waters of Tamil Nadu. 49-year-old Vijay, who belongs to the generation of actors after Rajinikanth and Kamal Haasan has a humongous fan following in south India, particularly Tamil Nadu. That has translated into the child artiste-turned-mainstream hero delivering monster hits in his career that has spanned over four decades. Many of Vijay's films have had political overtones with social messaging on current issues like GST, electoral fraud and terrorism. His movies are lavish entertainers with peppy music and targeted at his large youth fan base. His September 2024 release, rather pompously titled `The Greatest of all Time' (and marketed as G.O.A.T) may well be his last film before he plunges into politics, 24x7.\n\nVijay's fan club - Vijay Makkal Iyakkam (Vijay People's Movement) - was launched in 2009 to carry out philanthropic activities on behalf of the actor. But its political face came to the fore when, in the rural local bodies elections in the state in 2021, over 100 of its members emerged victorious. In February this year, Vijay took a step forward by christening his political party as 'Tamilaga Vettri Kazhagam' (Tamil Nadu Victory Party), stating his commitment to “fundamental political change” with transparent, caste-free and corruption-free administration. Even as the process of registering the party with the Election Commission began, Vijay said it would neither contest the 2024 Lok Sabha elections nor support any other outfit. 2026 was his goal, he declared.\n\nThe question that would obviously arise is whether Vijay can succeed at the political box-office in a state where Kamal Haasan and Rajinikanth have failed to deliver an EVM blockbuster. MG Ramachandran and J Jayalalithaa, who tasted political success, are often held as cinema stars-turned-political icons to emulate, but then MGR cut his teeth in politics for several years, was elected legislator and held important positions in the DMK, before he branched out to form his own AIADMK. Similarly, Jayalalithaa served as Propaganda Secretary of the AIADMK, was mentored by MGR and overcame a bitter power struggle with the Janaki Ramachandran faction of the party before going on to carve her niche in the hurly-burly of Tamil Nadu politics.\n\nSo what should Vijay do that Rajini and Kamal didn't do or couldn't do?\n\nRajinikanth spent close to two decades teasing the people of Tamil Nadu. Many of his movies were laced with teasing one-liners like ``Naan eppo varuven, epdi varuvennu yarukkum theriyathu. Aana vara vendiya nerathula correcta vandhuduven (No one can tell when or how I will arrive but when the time is right, I will be there), leading many to believe that the Superstar was keeping the gunpowder ready for a political role. His salvo against Jayalalithaa in 1996 contributed to her defeat. But Rajinikanth lacked a thick skin and was always a reluctant entrant. Though he launched an organisation subsequently and conducted several rounds of discussions with his fans, he finally declared during the Covid pandemic that he would not be stepping into politics.\n\nVijay has been seen in the Rajini mould too. His movies have always projected him as the one-man saviour, with dramatic monologues articulating his disdain for the rotten system. During the promotions of his 2018 film, 'Sarkar', he even spoke about what he would do if he became the chief minister. ``If I become the chief minister, I will never act'', he replied, hinting at the tendency to put on an act among chief ministers. Vijay's challenge will be to expand his excited fan base into a reliable votebank.\n\nKamal Haasan, in contrast, did not chicken out. Six years ago, in a much-publicised political advertisement, Kamal acted as if he was enraged by the sight of MK Stalin and Narendra Modi speaking on television and broke the TV set in a moment of cinematic drama. He formed the Makkal Needhi Maiam (MNM), which translated to Centre for People's Justice and wanted to emerge as an alternative to parties that he labelled as corrupt, family-run or those that expected the citizen to produce their nationalist credentials at the drop of a hat. Kamal's first day first show in the 2019 Lok Sabha elections, however, drew a blank with the MNM netting 3.6 percent of the vote.\n\nTwo years later, Kamal's second foray into the electoral arena saw him playing the lead role in the Coimbatore South assembly election, only to suffer a loss by a narrow margin of 1700-odd votes. The MNM whose symbol is the torch, has been low on battery ever since with Kamal busy with his acting assignments in Vikram, Indian 2 and Thug Life.\n\nCome 2024, Kamal was meant to gear up his MNM for the Lok Sabha elections as part of the INDIA bloc. He had met Rahul Gandhi and even participated in his Bharat Jodo Yatra. His friendship with Udayanidhi Stalin for reasons related to cinema, translated to a political equation with the DMK since chief minister MK Stalin's son is also the Sports minister of Tamil Nadu. Contrary to expectations, Kamal decided to stay away from the Parliamentary contest. In lieu of his offer to campaign for the DMK alliance candidates, the MNM was promised a Rajya Sabha seat in 2025. To say his decision disappointed the party cadre - whatever little is left of it - would be an understatement. The actor was expected to stand for election from either Coimbatore or Chennai South constituency. The acceptance of a post-dated Rajya Sabha seat seems like making a graceful exit from the cesspool of electoral politics.\n\nVijay needs to draw lessons from Kamal's rare inability to impress with a role. One, it is tough for political parties to succeed as a one-man outfit. Two, you cannot essay a political role by giving occasional call sheets.\n\nBeing projected as the next big thing in Tamil Nadu politics, the political chatter pits Vijay against his Kollywood colleague and the next in line to take over DMK's leadership mantle, Udayanidhi Stalin. Being born to a Christian father and a Hindu mother, Vijay, whose full name is Joseph Vijay Chandrasekhar, is spoken of as someone ideally positioned to split the minority vote and attract the larger youth vote.\n\nConspiracy theories even claim that he is the BJP's Plan C after its Plan A (read Rajinikanth) flopped and Plan B (read Annamalai) is in testing stage.\n\nIn his 2007 blockbuster `Pokkiri' (remade into Hindi as `Wanted' with Salman Khan), Vijay says “Oru vaati mudivu panta, yen pecha naane kekka maaten” (I won't listen even to myself once I have decided something). His fans would hope he would stay true to his word because, like Vijay's character in his 2012 superhit `Thuppaki', each one of them is also saying – “I am waiting”."
