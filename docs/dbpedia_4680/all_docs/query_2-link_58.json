Do you like this movie –\n\nTelecommunications Regulatory Commission of Sri Lanka (TRCSL) has decided to reallocate the radio frequencies to all the FM radio channels in Sri Lanka from November 01, 2012. There are 45 broadcasting channels in Sri Lanka currently functioning and they you may have to tune your radio tomorrow to listen to your favorite radio program or radio channel. This new allocation of radio frequencies is to minimize the technical issues which have effect the sound reception of most of the radio channels with the current allocation of radio frequencies.\n\nRadio channels in Sri Lanka operate within 87.5 – 108 MHz frequency range and TRCSL has the authority to determine the use of FM frequencies within the country.\n\nThe new allocation of radio frequencies will ensure that all broadcasting services could be accessed with ease. Also, this will make the sound broadcast clearly received. One remarkable improvement with the new plan is that listeners do not have to re-tune their radio to stay with their preferred radio channel when they are traveling within the country.\n\nThe existing frequency separation between two radio channels was 100 kHz and it hinders the clarity of sound. With the new allocation system there will be more space between two radio frequencies (300 kHz) and this will enable the listeners to have a clear reception in any part of the country from any single frequency.\n\nFollowing are the new radio frequencies of radio stations in Sri Lanka.\n\nLite FM – 87.6 , 87.8, Ran FM – 88.1, 88., Singhe FM – 88.6, 88.8, Isira Radio – 89.1, 89.3, City FM – 89.6 , City FM/Gamidiriya 89.8, Pirai FM/Wayamba/Jafna Regional Service – 90.1, Vettri FM – 90.4, 90.6, Shaa FM – 90.9, 91.1, Allai – 91.4, Sinhala National Service – 91.7, 91.9, FM Derana – 92.2, 92.4, Y FM – 92.7, Gold FM – 93, 93.2, Lakhanda 93.5, 93.7, V.I.P Radio 94, Sinhala Commercial Service 94.3, 94.5, Neth FM – 94.8, 95, Max Radio – 95.3, Rhythm FM – 95.6, 95.8, Hiru FM – 96.1, 96.3, Kirula FM 96.6, Kiss FM – 96.9, Real Radio – 97.1, English Service – 97.4, English/Dabana/Kotmale Community – 97.6, Cri (China Radion International) 97.9, Siyatha FM 98.2, 98.4, Sun FM – 98.7, 98.9, TNL Radio – 99.2, Red FM – 99.5, 99.7, Shree FM – 100, 100.2, Ran FM – 100.5, Yes FM 100.8, 101, The Buddhist 101.3, 101.5, Seth FM (Negombo)/TNL Radio 101.8, Tamil National Service 102.1, 102.3, Vasantham FM – 102.6, 102.8, Global Radio – 103.1, Sooriyan FM – 103.4, 103.6, Shakthi FM – 103.9, 104.1, Rangiri Sri Lanka – 104.4, Tendrai – 104.7, 104.9, Lakviru – 105.2, 105.4, Rangiri Sri Lanka – 105.7, Lak FM – 106, 106.2, Sirasa FM – 106.5, 106.7, V FM – 107, Ruhunu/Rajarata/Kandurata/UVA/Vidula/Sports Sevaya – 107.3, Ruhunu Sevaya/ Vidula/Sports Sevaya – 107.5, Tamil Service – 107.8\n\nWas this post helpful and did you like it ?\n\nPopularly known as “Dan Chuty” due to her role in “Chanchala Rekha” sinhala film, Nadeeka Gunasekara is one of talented and beautiful Sri Lankan cinema actresses. Even though her acting is now limited to guest appearances in selected movies, she is still in the heart of many Sinhala film fans. Recently we had a question in our Lanka Help Q & A site regarding Nadeeka Gunasekara’s family life and it prompted me to find more information about her.\n\nEarly life:\n\nNadeeka is the first child of Stanley Gunasekara, who worked at the Post Office in Nawalapitiya, Sri Lanka and her mother, Thalapatha Gunasekara, worked as a school teacher.\n\nNadeeka and family lived with Thalatha’s parents at Naranwela until she was 3 years old and later moved into Charle’s De Silva flats at Colombo.\n\nAccording to Nadeeka’s parents, Nadeeka was a stubborn young girl who gets angry with her parents so often. So, parents had to lift and cuddle to cool her down after every childish quarrels she had with them.\n\nHer first school was Udugoda Vidyalaya and it was only for three years before she had to change her school to Uduheenthanna Senadhikara Vidyalaya due to his father’s transfer to new post office. Due to these transfers Nadeeka had to change her school frequently and Her thrid school was in Gampola. When her father got a transfer to Monaragala in 1970, she was admitted to Pushpadana Ladies College in Kandy. Nadeeka’s last school was Bandrawela Vishaka College where she had to stay in a boarding place with her younger sister.\n\nNadeeka’s mother is also a film actress also a teacher. Nadeeka’s parents were separated due to her mother’s acting career. So her dad initially did not like Nadeeka to be an actress. However he blessed her to continue to act advising her to do what ever she does in right manner.\n\nShe did her Advance Level exam in Art stream and at that time she was attending Mahamaya girls college in Kandy. Surprisingly, she has never engaged in sport at school and claims she did not even sing a song at school.\n\nFirst Film and Acting Life:\n\nNadeeka appeared in the Shinahala Movie called, “Kanchana” in 1980 and it was her first step to the cinema. Nadeeka acted in 13 films as a leading role, produced 2 films and appeared in 32 films. Her latest film in 2012 was “Senasuru Maruwa” a successful comedy film.\n\nM.A. Sangadasa chose her to act in Kanchana film when she was still in A/L classes. However, Nadeeka managed to pass A/L with good results which enable her to enter Kelaniya university. As her university was closed few months she managed to appear in few other very good movies like “Thani Tharuwa”, “Vajira”, “Biththi Hathara”, “Chanchala Rekha” under new talented directors who was making a change in Sinhala cinema.\n\nReal Name:\n\nThough popularly known as Nadeeka Gunasekara, her real name is Disanayaka Wijesuriyage Sandya Darshani Gunasekara. Siri Kularathna has given her this screen name as she appeared in her first film when she was a student.\n\nFirst Award:\n\n1987 was a remarkable year for her as she graduated from Kelaniya university and she won her first award as up coming actress of the year at Lux film award ceremony.\n\nFamily Life:\n\nLike most other actresses of that time, Nadeeka’s main priority was her acting career and delayed her marriage. Still she does not worry about that delay as it allowed her to gather enough life experiences to become a better mother and a wife. Her husband is Mr. Suren Hapuarachci who is a businessman and the couple has a daughter. Nadeeka claims that they have dedicated their lives now to daughter Thenuki’s betterment. As a result she now appears in films very rarely and instead she runs a garment business dedicating more time to family and house work.\n\nAshton Agar is the latest addition to Australian test team.

Ulcers in patients with diabetes (Diabetic ulcer), venous ulcer in patients with varicose veins, Pressure ulcers in bed ridden patients, and ulcers due to cancer are few of the common causes of these chronic ulcers. Sri Lankan chemistry scientist has invented a medicine which can quickly cure these ulcers. In this article we will discuss Moratuwa university professor Anul Perera and his new invention Aerobic Anaerobic Disinfectant Antiseptic (AADA).\n\nThis medicine comes in a form of liquid and can be used in both inside and out side of the body ulcers. Even though it is beyond the scope of this article to scientifically explain this medicine this biological product works on the ulcer tissue locally killing the bacteria (germs). Also this medicine has almost no side effects.\n\nThe other advantage of medicine is that it is not necessary to admit patients to hospital to use this medicine. Patients can be taught to use this product at home. In quick time patients are able to see healthy tissue (Granulation tissue) forming on the ulcer base and achieving is vital for body’s natural healing.

May be this was the reason why he was abducted and tortured in a bid to create a funny television program. But it seems to be too much and beyond limits and Mihira is really hurt.\n\nMihira explains his dreadful experience; He has been abducted by a group of people in a Land Rover like vehicle. The kidnappers have said him that the purpose of abduction was for demanding ransom money. The drama was not limited to that scene. They even called his wife using his mobile phone and threatened. Then they ordered him to kneel down worshiping on the road amidst onlookers who are his fans.\n\nMihira is so emotional explaining his experience and what would have been the worst outcome. I think this type of act is uncalled for by any citizen let alone a person like Mihira who is famous. You can watch in the video below how Mihira explains this inhuman abduction and bitter experience."
