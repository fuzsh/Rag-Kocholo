        "text": "The name “Colombo”, first introduced by the Portuguese in 1505, is believed to be derived from the classical Sinhalesename කොලොන් තොට Kolon thota, meaning “port on the river Kelani“.[12]\n\nAnother belief is that the name is derived from the Sinhalese name කොල-අඹ-තොට Kola-amba-thota which means “Harbour with leafy mango trees”.[11]\n\nThe author of the oldest Sinhalese grammar, Sidatsangarava, written in the 13th century wrote about a category of words that exclusively belonged to early Sinhalese. It lists naramba (to see) and kolamba (ford or harbour) as belonging to an indigenous source. Kolamba may also be the source of the name of the commercial capital Colombo.[13][14]\n\nHistory[edit]\n\nAs Colombo possesses a natural harbour, it was known to Indian, Greeks, Persians, Romans, Arabs, and Chinese traders over 2,000 years ago. Traveller Ibn Batuta who visited the island in the 14th century, referred to it as Kalanpu.[15] Arabs, whose prime interests were trade, began to settle in Colombo around the 8th century AD mostly because the port helped their business by the way of controlling much of the trade between the Sinhalesekingdoms and the outside world. Their descendants now comprise the local Sri Lankan Moor community.[10][16]\n\nPortuguese era[edit]\n\nPortuguese explorers led by Dom Lourenço de Almeida first arrived in Sri Lanka in 1505. During their initial visit they made a treaty with the King of Kotte, Parakramabahu VIII (1484–1508), which enabled them to trade in the island’s crop of cinnamon, which lay along the coastal areas of the island, including in Colombo.[17] As part of the treaty, the Portuguese were given full authority over the coastline in exchange for the promise of guarding the coast against invaders. They were allowed to establish a trading post in Colombo.[17] Within a short time, however, they expelled the Muslim inhabitants of Colombo and began to build a fort in 1517.\n\nThe Portuguese soon realized that control of Sri Lanka was necessary for protection of their coastal establishments in India and they began to manipulate the rulers of the Kotte kingdom to gain control of the area. After skilfully exploiting rivalries within the royal family, they took control of a large area of the kingdom and the Sinhalese King Mayadunne established a new kingdom at Sitawaka, a domain in the Kotte kingdom.[17] Before long he annexed much of the Kotte kingdom and forced the Portuguese to retreat to Colombo, which was repeatedly besieged by Mayadunne and the later kings of Sitawaka, forcing them to seek reinforcement from their major base in Goa, India. Following the fall of the kingdom in 1593, the Portuguese were able to establish complete control over the coastal area, with Colombo as their capital.[17][18] This part of Colombo is still known as Fort and houses the presidential palace and the majority of Colombo’s five star hotels. The area immediately outside Fort is known as Pettah (Sinhala පිට කොටුව piṭa koṭuva, “outer fort”) and is a commercial hub.\n\nDutch era[edit]\n\nIn 1638 the Dutch signed a treaty with King Rajasinha II of Kandy which assured the king assistance in his war against the Portuguese in exchange for a monopoly of the island’s major trade goods. The Portuguese resisted the Dutch and the Kandyans but were gradually defeated in their strongholds beginning in 1639.[19] The Dutch captured Colombo in 1656 after an epic siege, at the end of which a mere 93 Portuguese survivors were given safe conduct out of the fort. Although the Dutch (e.g., Rijcklof van Goens) initially restored the captured area back to the Sinhalese kings, they later refused to turn them over and gained control over the island’s richest cinnamon lands including Colombo which then served as the capital of the Dutch maritime provinces under the control of the Dutch East India Company until 1796.[19][20]\n\nBritish era[edit]\n\nAlthough the British captured Colombo in 1796, it remained a British military outpost until the Kandyan Kingdom was ceded to them in 1815 and they made Colombo the capital of their newly created crown colony of British Ceylon. Unlike the Portuguese and Dutch before them, whose primary use of Colombo was as a military fort, the British began constructing houses and other civilian structures around the fort, giving rise to the current City of Colombo.[10]\n\nInitially, they placed the administration of the city under a “Collector”, and John Macdowell of the Madras Service was the first to hold the office. Then, in 1833, the Government Agent of the Western Province was charged with the administration of the city. Centuries of colonial rule had meant a decline of indigenous administration of Colombo, and in 1865 the British conceived a Municipal Council as a means of training the local population in self-governance. The Legislative Council of Ceylon constituted the Colombo Municipal Council in 1865 and the Council met for the first time on the January 16, 1866. At the time, the population of the region was around 80,000.[10]\n\nDuring the time they were in control of the Colombo, the British were responsible for much of the planning of the present city. In some parts of the city tram car tracks and granite flooring laid during the era are still visible today.[20][21]\n\nAfter independence[edit]\n\nThis era of colonialism ended peacefully in 1948 when Ceylon gained independence from Britain.[22] Due to the tremendous impact this caused on the city’s inhabitants and on the country as a whole, the changes that resulted at the end of the colonial period were drastic. An entire new culture took root. Changes in laws and customs, clothing styles, religions and proper nameswere a significant result of the colonial era.[22] These cultural changes were followed by the strengthening of the island’s economy. Even today, the influence of the Portuguese, the Dutch and the British is clearly visible in Colombo’s architecture, names, clothing, food, language and attitudes. Buildings from all three eras stand as reminders of the turbulent past of Colombo. The city and its people show an interesting mix of European clothing and lifestyles together with local customs.[22]\n\nHistorically, Colombo referred to the area around the Fort and Pettah Market which is famous for the variety of products available as well as the Khan Clock Tower, a local landmark. At present, it refers to the city limits of the Colombo Municipal Council.[23] More often, the name is used for the Conurbation known as Greater Colombo, which encompasses several Municipal councils including Kotte, Dehiwela and Colombo.\n\nAlthough Colombo lost its status as the capital of Sri Lanka in the 1980s, it continues to be the island’s commercial centre. Despite the official capital of Sri Lanka moving to the adjacent Sri Jayawardanapura Kotte, most countries still maintain their diplomatic missions in Colombo.[24]\n\nGeography[edit]\n\nColombo’s geography is a mix of land and water. The city has many canals and, in the heart of the city, the 65-hectare (160-acre) Beira Lake.[25] The lake is one of the most distinctive landmarks of Colombo, and was used for centuries by colonists to defend the city.[25] It remains a popular attraction, hosting regattas,[26] and theatrical events on its shores. The Northern and North-Eastern border of the city of Colombo is formed by the Kelani River, which meets the sea in a part of the city known as the Modera (mōdara in Sinhala) which means river delta.\n\nClimate[edit]\n\nColombo features a tropical monsoon climate under the Köppen climate classification, falling just short of a tropical rainforest climate. Colombo’s climate is fairly temperate all throughout the year. From March to April the average high temperature is around 31 °C (87.8 °F).[27] The only major change in the Colombo weather occurs during the monsoon seasons from May to August and October to January. This is the time of year where heavy rains can be expected. Colombo sees little relative diurnal range of temperature, although this is more marked in the drier winter months, where minimum temperatures average 22 °C (71.6 °F). Rainfall in the city averages around 2,500 millimetres (98 in) a year.[28]\n\n[hide]Climate data for Colombo, Sri Lanka (1961–1990, extremes 1961–2012) Month Jan Feb Mar Apr May Jun Jul Aug Sep Oct Nov Dec Year Record high °C (°F) 35.2\n\n(95.4) 35.6\n\n(96.1) 36.1\n\n(97) 35.2\n\n(95.4) 33.2\n\n(91.8) 33.5\n\n(92.3) 32.2\n\n(90) 32.2\n\n(90) 32.5\n\n(90.5) 33.6\n\n(92.5) 34.0\n\n(93.2) 35.0\n\n(95) 36.1\n\n(97) Average high °C (°F) 31.0\n\n(87.8) 31.2\n\n(88.2) 31.7\n\n(89.1) 31.8\n\n(89.2) 31.1\n\n(88) 30.4\n\n(86.7) 30.0\n\n(86) 30.0\n\n(86) 30.2\n\n(86.4) 30.0\n\n(86) 30.2\n\n(86.4) 30.4\n\n(86.7) 30.7\n\n(87.3) Daily mean °C (°F) 26.6\n\n(79.9) 26.9\n\n(80.4) 27.7\n\n(81.9) 28.2\n\n(82.8) 28.3\n\n(82.9) 27.9\n\n(82.2) 27.6\n\n(81.7) 27.6\n\n(81.7) 27.5\n\n(81.5) 27.0\n\n(80.6) 26.7\n\n(80.1) 26.6\n\n(79.9) 27.4\n\n(81.3) Average low °C (°F) 22.3\n\n(72.1) 22.7\n\n(72.9) 23.7\n\n(74.7) 24.6\n\n(76.3) 25.5\n\n(77.9) 25.5\n\n(77.9) 25.1\n\n(77.2) 25.1\n\n(77.2) 24.8\n\n(76.6) 24.0\n\n(75.2) 23.2\n\n(73.8) 22.8\n\n(73) 24.1\n\n(75.4) Record low °C (°F) 16.4\n\n(61.5) 18.8\n\n(65.8) 17.7\n\n(63.9) 21.2\n\n(70.2) 20.5\n\n(68.9) 21.4\n\n(70.5) 21.4\n\n(70.5) 21.6\n\n(70.9) 21.2\n\n(70.2) 21.0\n\n(69.8) 18.6\n\n(65.5) 18.1\n\n(64.6) 16.4\n\n(61.5) Average precipitation mm (inches) 58.2\n\n(2.291) 72.7\n\n(2.862) 128.0\n\n(5.039) 245.6\n\n(9.669) 392.4\n\n(15.449) 184.9\n\n(7.28) 121.9\n\n(4.799) 119.5\n\n(4.705) 245.4\n\n(9.661) 365.4\n\n(14.386) 414.4\n\n(16.315) 175.3\n\n(6.902) 2,523.7\n\n(99.358) Average precipitation days 5 5 9 14 16 16 12 11 15 17 15 10 145 Average relative humidity (%) (at Daytime) 69 69 71 75 78 79 78 77 78 78 76 73 75 Mean monthly sunshine hours 248.0 246.4 275.9 234.0 201.5 195.0 201.5 201.5 189.0 201.5 210.0 217.0 2,621.3 Source #1: NOAA[29] World Meteorological Organization (precipitation only)[28] Source #2: Deutscher Wetterdienst (extremes)[30]\n\nAttractions[edit]\n\nGalle Face Green is located in the heart of the city along the Indian Ocean coast, and is a popular destination for tourists and residents alike. The Galle Face Hotel is a historic landmark on the southern edge of this promenade.\n\nGangaramaya Temple is one of the most important temples in Colombo. The temple’s architecture demonstrates an eclectic mix of Sri Lankan, Thai, Indian, and Chinese architecture.[31]\n\nThe Viharamahadevi Park (formerly Victoria Park) is an urban park located next to the National Museum of Colombo and the Town Hall. It is the oldest and largest park in Colombo and features a large Buddha statue.\n\nAs part of the Urban Regeneration Program of the Government of Sri Lanka, many old sites and buildings were revamped to modern public recreational spaces and shopping precincts. These include Independence Memorial Hall Square, Pettah Floating Market and Old Dutch Hospital among others.\n\nDemographics[edit]\n\nColombo is a multi-ethnic, multi-cultural city. The population of Colombo is a mix of numerous ethnic groups, mainly Sinhalese, Sri Lankan Tamils, and Sri Lankan Moor. There are also small communities of people with Chinese, Portuguese Burgher, Dutch Burgher, Malay, and Indian origins living in the city, as well as numerous European expatriates. Colombo is the most populous city in Sri Lanka, with 642,163 people living within the city limits.[32] In 1866 the city had a population of around 80,000.[33]According to the census of 2001 the demographics of urban Colombo by ethnicity is as follows.[32]\n\nNo Ethnicity Population % Of Total 1 Sinhalese 265,657 41.36 2 Sri Lankan Tamils 185,672 28.91 3 Sri Lankan Moors 153,299 23.87 4 Indian Tamils 13,968 2.17 5 Sri Lankan Malays 11,149 1.73 6 Burghers 5,273 0.82 7 Sri Lankan Chetty 740 0.11 8 Bharatha 471 0.07 9 Other 5,934 0.96 10 Total 642,163 100\n\nGovernment and politics[edit]\n\nLocal government[edit]\n\nColombo is a charter city, with a Mayor Council form of government. Colombo’s mayor and the council members are elected through local government elections held once in five years. For the past 50 years the city had been ruled by the United National Party (UNP), a right leaning party, whose business friendly policies resonate with the population of Colombo. However the UNP nomination list for the 2006 Municipal elections was rejected,[34] and an Independent Group supported by the UNP won the elections.[35] Uvais Mohamed Imitiyas was subsequently appointed Mayor of Colombo.[36]\n\nThe city government provides sewer, road management and waste management services, in case of water, electricity and telephone utility services the council liaises with the water supply and drainage board, the Ceylon electricity board and telephone service providers.\n\nNational capital[edit]\n\nColombo was the capital of the Coastal areas controlled by the Portuguese, Dutch and the British from the 1700s to the 1815 when the British gained control of the entire island following the Kandian convention. From then until the 1980s the national capital of the island was Colombo. During the 1980s plans were made to move the administrative capital to Sri Jayawardenepura Kotte and thus move all governmental institutions out of Colombo to make way for commercial activities. As a primary step the Parliament was moved to a new complex in Kotte and several ministries and departments were also moved. However the move was never completed. Today many governmental institutions still remain in Colombo. These include the President’s House, Presidential Secretariat, Prime Minister’s House (Temple Trees), Prime Minister’s Office, the Supreme Court of Sri Lanka, Central Bank of Sri Lanka, important government ministries and departments; such as Finance (Treasury), Defence, Public Administration & Home affairs, Foreign affairs, Justice and the Military headquarters, Naval headquarters (SLNS Parakrama), Air Force headquarters (SLAF Colombo) and Police national and field force headquarters.[37][38]\n\nCity limits[edit]\n\nColombo is divided into 15 numbered areas for the purposes of postal services. Within these areas are the suburbs with their corresponding post office.\n\nPostal number Inner Suburb Colombo 1 Fort Colombo 2 Slave Island, Union Place Colombo 3 Kollupitiya Colombo 4 Bambalapitiya Colombo 5 Havelock Town, Kirulapana Colombo 6 Wellawatte, Pamankada, Colombo 7 Cinnamon Gardens Colombo 8 Borella Colombo 9 Dematagoda Colombo 10 Maradana, Panchikawatte Colombo 11 Pettah Colombo 12 Hultsdorf Colombo 13 Kotahena, Bloemendhal Colombo 14 Grandpass Colombo 15 Mutwal, Modara, Mattakkuliya, Madampitiya\n\nCapital Zone suburbs[edit]\n\nSri Jayawardenepura Kotte Legislature\n\nPitaKotte\n\nEthulKotte\n\nNawala\n\nNugegoda\n\nRajagiriya\n\nOuter suburbs[edit]\n\nEconomy[edit]\n\nThe great majority of Sri Lankan corporations have their head offices in Colombo including Aitken Spence, Ceylinco Corporation, Stassen group of companies, John Keells Holdings, Cargills, Hemas Holdings, and Akbar Brothers. Some of the industries include chemicals, textiles, glass, cement, leather goods, furniture, and jewellery. In the city centre is the World Trade Centre. The 40 story Twin Tower complex is the centre of important commercial establishments, in the Fort district, the city’s nerve center. Right outside the Fort area is Pettah which is derived from the Sinhalese word pita which means ‘out’ or ‘outside’.[39]\n\nThe Colombo Metropolitan area has a GDP of $48 billion or 40% of the GDP, making it the most important aspect of the Sri Lankan economy. The per capita income of Colombo Metro area stood at US$8623 and purchasing power per capita of $25,117, making it one of the most prosperous regions in South Asia considering Western Province contribute for 50% of GDP in Sri Lanka .[40] The Colombo Metropolitan (CM) area is the most important industrial, commercial and administrative centre in Sri Lanka. A major share of the country’s export-oriented manufacturing takes place in the CM area which is the engine of growth for Sri Lanka.\n\nThe Western province contributes less than 40% to the GDP and about 80% of industrial value additions although it accounts for only 5.7% of the country’s geographic area and 25% of the national population. Given its importance as the primary international gateway for Sri Lanka and as the main economic driver of the country, the government of Sri Lanka (GoSL) has launched an ambitious program to transform Colombo and its area into a metropolis of international standards. Bottlenecks are preventing the Colombo metropolitan area from realizing its full economic potential. To facilitate the transformation of Colombo, the government has to address these bottlenecks which have for long been obstructing economic and physical urban regeneration.[41]\n\nPettah is more crowded than the Fort area. Pettah’s roads are always packed and pavements are full of small stalls selling items from delicious sharbat to shirts. Main Street consists mostly of clothes shops and the cross roads, which are known as Cross Streets where each of the five streets specializes in a specific business. For example, the First Cross Street is mostly electronic goods shops, the Second cellular phones and fancy goods. Most of these businesses are dominated by Muslim traders. At the end of the Main Street further away from Fort is the Sea Street — Sri Lanka’s gold market — dominated by Tamil interests. This mile-long street is full of jewellery shops,[39] including the former head office of SriLankan Airlines.[42]\n\nLaw enforcement and crime[edit]\n\nThe Sri Lanka Police the main law enforcement agency of the island liaise with the municipal council, but is under the control of the Ministry of Defence of the central government.[43] Policing in Colombo and its suburbs falls within the Metropolitan Rangeheaded by the Deputy Inspector General of Police (Metropolitan), this also includes the Colombo Crime Division.[44] As with most Sri Lankan cities, the magistrate court handles felony crimes, the district court handles civil cases.\n\nAs in other large cities around the world, Colombo experiences certain levels of street crime and bribery. Indeed, the corruption extends to the very top, US reports show. In addition, in the period from the 1980s to 2009 there have been a number of major terrorist attacks.[45][46] The LTTE has been linked to most of the bombings and assassinations in the city.[47] Welikada Prison is situated in Colombo and it is one of the largest maximum-security prisons in the country.[48]\n\nInfrastructure[edit]\n\nColombo has most of the amenities that a modern city has. Compared to other parts of the country, Colombo has the highest degree of infrastructure. Electricity, water and transport to street lamps, phone booths, etc. have a considerably good standard. The majority of the major shopping malls in Sri Lanka are in the city, of which all are wi-fi enabled. Apart from that, many luxurious hotels, clubs and restaurants are in the city. In recent times there’s been an outpour of high rise condominiums, mainly due to the very high land prices.[49]\n\nHarbour[edit]\n\nColombo Harbour is the largest and one of the busiest ports in Sri Lanka. Colombo was established primarily as a port city during the colonial era, with an artificial harbour that has been expanded over the years. The Sri Lanka Navy maintains a naval base, SLNS Rangalla, within the harbour.\n\nThe Port of Colombo handled 3.75 million twenty-foot equivalent units in 2008, 10.6% up on 2007 (which itself was 9.7% up on 2006), bucking the global economic trend. Of those, 817,000 were local shipments with the rest transshipments. Currently with a capacity of 5.7 million TEUs and a dredged depth of over 15 m (49 ft),[2] the Colombo Harbour is one of the busiest ports in the world, and ranks among the top 25 ports (23rd).\n\nTransport[edit]\n\nBus[edit]\n\nMain article: Colombo Bus Routes\n\nColombo has an extensive public transport system based on buses operated both by private operators and the government owned Sri Lanka Transport Board (SLTB). The three primary bus terminals — Bastian Mawatha, Central, and the Gunasinghapura Bus Terminals — are in Pettah. Bastian Mawatha handles long distance services whereas Gunasinghapura and Central handle local services.\n\nRail[edit]\n\nTrain transport in the city is limited since most trains are meant for transport to and from the city rather than within it and are often overcrowded. However, the Central Bus Stand and Fort Railway Station function as the island’s primary hub for bus and rail transport respectively. Up until the 1970s the city had tram services, which were discontinued. Other means of transport includes auto rickshaws (commonly called “three wheelers”) and taxicabs. Three wheelers are entirely operated by individuals and hardly regulated whilst cab services are run by private companies and are metered.\n\nMain Line – Colombo Fort to Veyangoda; onwards to Kandy, Badulla, Matale, Kurunegala, Anuradhapura, Kankesanturai.Trincomalee, Batticaloa, Talaimannar (presently just Madhu Road).\n\nCoastal Line – Colombo to Panadura; onwards to Galle and Matara.\n\nPuttalam Line – Colombo to Ja-Ela; onwards to Negombo and Puttalam.\n\nKelani Valley Line – Colombo to Avissawella.\n\nSeveral types of rail based options have been proposed to control to control the excessive traffic.Advanced stages of feasibility investigations into the Colombo Metro Rail, a Mass Rapid Transit railway system has begun. The project is carried out by NEB Rapid Infrastructure Projects Pvt. Ltd., an Indian and Singaporean collaboration.[50][51] Alternatively a monorail system is planned too.[52] Currently Sri Lanka is searching for possible investors for a Monorail or a subway system.[53]\n\nRoads[edit]\n\nPost-war development in the Colombo area also involves the construction of numerous expressway grade arterial road routes. The first of these constructed is the Southern Expressway, which goes from Kottawa, a southern suburb of Colombo, to Matara City in the south of the country. Expressways under construction in the Colombo metropolitan area include the Colombo–Katunayake Expressway which was opened in October 2013 and the Colombo orbital bypass Outer Circular Highway (Arthur C. Clarke Expressway) which is due to be opened in 2014. The Colombo-Katunayake Expressway (E03) runs from Peliyagoda, a nourthern suburb of Colombo, to Colombo International Airport and it linked with one of the major commercial hubs and a major tourist destination of the country, the city of Negombo.[54][55]\n\nA1 highway connects Colombo with Kandy.\n\nA2 highway connects Colombo with Galle and Matara\n\nA3 highway connects Colombo with Negombo and Puttalam\n\nA4 highway connects Colombo with Ratnapura and Batticaloa\n\nFerry[edit]\n\nAn international ferry liner, the Scotia Prince, is conducting a ferry service to Tuticorin, India. Ferry services between the two countries have been revived after more than 20 years.[56]\n\nAir[edit]\n\nRatmalana Airport is the city’s airport, located 15 km (9.3 mi) south of the city centre. It commenced operating in 1935 and was the country’s first international airport until it was replaced by Bandaranaike Airport in 1967. Ratmalana Airport now primarily services domestic flights, aviation training and international corporate flights.\n\nLandmarks[edit]\n\nThe two World Trade Centre towers used to be the most recognized landmarks of the city. Before they were completed in 1997, the adjacent Bank of Ceylon tower was the tallest structure and the most prominent city landmark. Before the skyscrapers were built it was the Old Parliament Building that stood majestically in the Fort district with the Old Colombo Lighthouse close to it. Another important landmark is the Independence Hall at Independence Square in Cinnamon Gardens.\n\nEven before the parliament was built some claim that the Jami Ul-Alfar Mosque was recognized as the landmark of Colombo by sailors approaching the port. The mosque is still one of the most visited tourist sites in Colombo.\n\nAnother landmark is St.Paul’s Church Milagiriya, one of the oldest churches in Sri Lanka, first built by the Portuguese and re-built by the British in 1848.\n\nThe Fort district has Cargills & Millers complex that is protected by a special government law from demolition. This is done mainly to preserve the historic beauty of the Fort area.\n\nThe Galle Face Green is the city’s largest and most elegant promenade. Lined with palm trees and adjacent to the coast, this mile-long stretch in the heart of the city is a constant beehive of activity. The green is especially busy on Fridays and Saturdays. In the evenings it plays host to families and children playing sports and flying kites, lovers embracing under umbrellas and health enthusiasts taking their evening walks. There are numerous small food stalls and a small stretch of beach. The green was recently[when?] given a makeover and since then has been even more popular with the local community. The Green frequently hosts international and local concerts and performances, such as the recently concluded World Drum Festival.\n\nCannons that were once mounted on the rampart of the old fort of Colombo laid out for observance and prestige at the Green, giving a colonial touch to the city. The famous colonial styled Galle Face Hotel, known as Asia’s Emerald on the Green since 1864, is adjacent to Galle Face Green. The hotel has played host to distinguished guests including the British Royal Family and other royal guests and celebrities. After a stay at the hotel, Princess Alexandra of Denmark commented that “the peacefulness and generosity encountered at the Galle Face Hotel cannot be matched.”[57] Also facing Galle Face Green is the Ceylon Inter-Continental Hotel, Sri Lanka’s first five-star hotel. Around the corner from Galle Face are prominent coffee bars, chic bars and boutiques.\n\nEducation[edit]\n\nEducation institutions in Colombo have a long history. Colombo has many of the prominent public schools in the country, some of them government-owned and others private. Most of the prominent schools in the city date back to the 1800s when they were established during the British colonial rule,[58] such as the Royal College Colombo established in 1835. Certain urban schools of Sri Lanka have some religious alignment; this is partly due to the influence of British who established Christian missionary schools.[59][60] These include the Anglican, Bishop’s College(1875); the Methodist, Wesley College Colombo (1874); the Buddhist, Ananda College (1886); the Muslim, Zahira College (1892); the St.Benedict’s College (1985), the Catholic, St. Joseph’s College (1896). The religious alignments do not affect the curriculum of the school except for the demographics of the student population.[59] Colombo has many International Schools that have come up in the recent years.\n\nHigher education in the city has a long history, beginning with the establishment of the Colombo Medical School (1870), the Colombo Law College (1875), School of Agriculture (1884) and the Government Technical College (1893). The first step in the creation of a University in Colombo was taken in 1913 with the establishment of the University College Colombo which prepared students for the external examinations of the University of London. This was followed by the establishment of the University of Ceylon in Colombo.[61] Today the University of Colombo and the University of the Visual & Performing Arts are state universities in the city. The Sri Lanka Institute of Information Technology has a metropolitan campus in the city centre. There are several private higher education institutions in the city.\n\nSee also: Education in Sri Lanka\n\nArchitecture[edit]\n\nColombo has wildly varying architecture that span centuries and depict many styles. Colonial buildings influenced by the Portuguese, Dutch and British exist alongside structures built in Buddhist, Hindu, Islamic, Indian and Contemporaryarchitectural styles. No other place is this more evident in the Fort area. Here one may find new towering skyscrapers as well as historic buildings dating far back as the 1700s.[62][63]\n\nColombo Fort[edit]\n\nThe Portuguese were the first colonists to settle in Colombo; establishing a small trading post, they had laid the foundations for a small fort which in time became the largest colonial fort in the island. The Dutch expanded the fort thus creating a well old fortified harbour. This came into the possession of the British in the late 1700s and by the late 19th century the seeing no threat to the Colombo Harbour, began demolishing the ramparts to make way for the development of the city. Although now there is nothing left of the fortifications, the area which was once the fort is still referred to as Fort. The area outside is Pettah or පිටකොටුව in Sinhalese which means outer fort.[62][63]\n\nDutch-era buildings[edit]\n\nThere are none of the buildings of the Portuguese era and only a few from the Dutch period. These include the oldest building in the fort area, the former Dutch Hospital, the Dutch House which is now the Colombo Dutch Museum and several churches. The President’s House (formerly the Queen’s House) was originally the Dutch governor’s house, and successive British governors made it their office and residence. However, it has undergone much change since the Dutch period. Adjoining the President’s House are the Gordon Gardens, now off limits to the public.[62][63][64]\n\nBritish-era buildings[edit]\n\nMuch of the old buildings of the fort area and in other parts of the city date back to the British times, these include governmental, commercial buildings and private houses. Some of the notable government building of British colonial architecture includes; the old Parliament building which is now the Presidential Secretariat, the Republic Building which houses the Ministry of Foreign affairs, but once housed the Ceylon Legislative council, the General Treasury Building, the old General Post Office an Edwardian style building opposite the President’s House, the Prime Minister’s Office, the Central Telegraph Office, the Mathematics department of the University of Colombo (formally the Royal College, Colombo).[61] Notable commercial buildings of the British era include the Galle Face Hotel, Cargills & Millers’ complex, and Grand Oriental Hotel.[62][63]\n\nThe historical Cargills & Millers building continues as the headquarters of Cargills (Ceylon) PLC\n\nThe Old Parliament Building near the Galle Face Green, now the Presidential Secretariat\n\nThe Neoclassical style Colombo National Museum\n\nCulture[edit]\n\nAnnual cultural events and fairs[edit]\n\nColombo’s most beautiful festival is the celebration of Buddha‘s birth, enlightenment and death all falling on the same day.[65] In Sinhala this is known as Vesak.[65] During this festival, much of the city is decorated with lanterns, lights and special displays of light (known as thoran). The festival falls in mid May and lasts a week. Many Sri Lankans visit the city to see the lantern competitions and decorations. During this week people distribute, rice, drinks and other food items for free in dunsal which means charity place. These dunsal are popular amongst visitors from the suburbs.\n\nSince there is a large number of Muslims in Colombo. Eid Ul Fitr and Eid Ul Adha are two Islamic festivals that are celebrated in Colombo. Many businesses flourish during the eventual countdown for Eid Ul Fitr which is a major Islamic festival celebrated by Muslims after a month-long fasting. Colombo is generally very busy during the eve of the festivals as people do their last minute shopping.\n\nChristmas is another major festival. Although Sri Lanka’s Christians make up only just over 7% of the population, Christmas is one of the island’s biggest festivals. Most streets and commercial buildings light up from the beginning of December and festive sales begin at all shopping centres and department stores. Caroling and nativity plays are frequent sights during the season.\n\nThe Sinhala and Hindu Aluth Awurudda’ is a cultural event that takes place on 13 and 14 April. This is the celebration of the Sinhala and Hindu new year. The festivities include many events and traditions that display a great deal of Sri Lankan culture. Several old clubs of the city give a glimpse of the British equestrian life style; these include the Colombo Club, Orient Club, the 80 Club, the Colombo Cricket Club.\n\nPerforming arts[edit]\n\nColombo has several performing arts centers which are popular for their musical and theatrical performances. The most famous performing arts centers are the Lionel Wendt Theatre, the Elphinstone, and Tower Hall, all of which have a very rich history and made for western style productions. The Navarangahala found in the city is the country’s first national theatredesigned and build for Asian and local style musical and theatrical productions.\n\nThe Nelum Pokuna Mahinda Rajapaksa Theatre is a world-class theatre that opened in December 2011.[66] Designed in the form of the Lotus Pond in Polonnaruwa,[67] the theatre is a major theatre destination.\n\nMuseums and art collections[edit]\n\nThe National Museum of Colombo, established on 1 January 1877 during the tenure of the British Colonial Governor SirWilliam Henry Gregory, is in the Cinnamon Gardens area.[68] The museum houses the crown jewels and throne of the last king of the kingdom of Kandy, Sri Vikrama Rajasinha.[69]\n\nThere is also the Colombo Dutch Museum detailing the Dutch colonial history of the country. Colombo does not boast a very big art gallery. There is a small collection of random Sri Lankan paintings at the Art Gallery in Green Path; next to it is the Natural History Museum.\n\nSports[edit]\n\nOne of the most popular sports in Sri Lanka is cricket. The country emerged as champions of the 1996 Cricket World Cup and became runners up in 2007 and 2011. In the ICC World Twenty20 they became runners up in 2009 and 2012 and winners in 2014. The sport is played in parks, playgrounds, beaches and even in the streets. Colombo is the home for two of the country’s most popular international cricket stadiums, Sinhalese Sports Club‘s cricket stadium and R. Premadasa Stadium (named after late president Premadasa).\n\nColombo has the distinction of being the only city in the world to have four cricket test venues in the past: Paikiasothy Saravanamuttu Stadium, Sinhalese Sports Club Ground, Colombo Cricket Club Ground and Ranasinghe Premadasa Stadium. The Sugathadasa Stadium is an international standard stadium for athletics, swimming and football, also held the South Asian Games in 1991 and 2006. Situated in Colombo the Royal Colombo Golf Club is one of the oldest in Asia. Other sporting clubs in Colombo include Colombo Swimming Club, Colombo Rowing Club and the Yachting Association of Sri Lanka.\n\nRugby is also a popular sport at the club and school level. Colombo has its own local football team Colombo FC and the sport is being developed as a part of the FIFA Goal program.\n\nThe Colombo Port City is to include a new Formula One track, constructed in the vicinity of the Colombo Harbour. According to Dr. Priyath Wickrama, the Chairman of the Sri Lanka Ports Authority, an eight lane F1 track will “definitely” be a part of the New Port City. This would host The Sri Lankan Grand Prix.\n\nColombo Marathon is an internationally recognised marathon established in 1998.\n\nMedia[edit]\n\nAlmost all major media businesses in Sri Lanka operate from Colombo. The state media has its offices in Bullers Road and does carry out regional transmission from there. This includes the Sri Lanka Broadcasting Corporation (SLBC), formerly known as Radio Ceylon and the Sri Lanka Rupavahini Corporation. The SLBC is the oldest radio station in South Asia and the second oldest in the world. Many of the private broadcasting companies have their offices and transmission stations in or around Colombo. As with most metro areas, radio bands are highly utilised for radio communications. Some of the prominent radio stations broadcasting in the Colombo area are Sirasa FM, FM Derana, Hiru FM, Shakthi FM, Vettri FM, Sooriyan FM, Kiss FM, Lite FM, Yes FM, Gold FM, Sith FM, Y FM and many more.\n\nTelevision networks operating in the Colombo metro area include the state-owned television broadcasting networks which are broadcast from the Rupavahini Corporation of Sri Lanka, broadcasting television in the official languages Sinhala and Tamil.
