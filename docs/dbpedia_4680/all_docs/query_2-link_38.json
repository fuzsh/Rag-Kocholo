        "text": "Kumar Chokshanada Sangakkara (Sinhalese: කුමාර් චෝක්ශනාද සංගක්කාර; born 27 October 1977) is a professional Sri Lankan Test cricketer, a former one-day and T20 player, and former captain of the Sri Lankan national team. He is widely regarded as one of the greatest batsmen of all time. He is also arguably the greatest Sri Lankan to play the game along with long time team mate and friend, Mahela Jayawardene and holds numerous batting records in the modern era across all formats of the game.[1][2][3][4][5][6] A left-handed top-order batsman, he is also a record-breaking wicket-keeper, although he no longer keeps wickets at Test level. Currently, he is the second-highest run-scorer in ODI cricket and the fifth-highest run scorer in Test cricket.[7][8]\n\nSangakkara is described as one of the “most polished and prudent of batsmen” in cricket.[9][10] Along with AB de Villiers, he has dominated the number one spot in the ICC Test batting rankings over the past decade. At 12 August 2015, Kumar Sangakkara was placed at number 5 in the ICC Test rankings.[11]\n\nSangakkara was a key member of the team that won the 2014 ICC World Twenty20 and was part of the team that made the final of the 2007 Cricket World Cup, 2011 Cricket World Cup, 2009 ICC World Twenty20 and 2012 ICC World Twenty20. He won the Man of the Match award in the final of the 2014 ICC World Twenty20, where he helped the team win their first title.\n\nSangakkara delivered the 2011 MCC Spirit of Cricket Cowdrey Lecture, which gained worldwide attention.[12] He was the youngest person and the first active international player to deliver that lecture, which was widely praised by the cricketing community for its outspoken nature.[13][14]\n\nIn terms of number of innings required, Sangakkara is the fastest batsman to reach 8,000, 9,000, 11,000 and 12,000 runs in Test cricket. He is also joint fastest to 10,000.[15] He won the ICC Cricketer of the Year in 2012, Test Cricketer of the Year in 2012, and ODI Cricketer of the Year multiple times in 2011 and 2013.[16] He has also won the LG People’s Choice Award twice, in 2011 and 2012. Sangakkara has regularly featured in the World Test XI and World ODI XI, appearing six times and three times in them, respectively. He was selected as Leading Cricketer in the World in the 2015 edition of Wisden.\n\nAlong with teammate Mahela Jayawardene, he recorded the most partnership runs for the 3rd wicket in Tests, scoring 5890 runs surpassing the 5826 runs of Rahul Dravid and Sachin Tendulkar, during the first Test match against Pakistan at Galle International Stadium. The two also hold the record for the highest partnership for any wicket in Test matches, scoring 624 runs for the 3rd wicket against South Africa in 2006.[17] This still stands as the largest partnership for any wicket in first-class cricket, anywhere.[18]\n\nOn January 29, 2015, Sangakkara became Sri Lanka’s highest ever ODI run scorer, surpassing the previous record of 13430 runs held by Sanath Jayasuriya. In the same match, he also broke the record for ODI wicketkeeping dismissals, breaking the previous record of 472 held by Adam Gilchrist.\n\nHe retired from ODIs on 18 March 2015, against South Africa during the quarter final stage of 2015 ICC Cricket World Cup. He has stated that he will finish his Test career in August 2015.[19][20]\n\nHe was named the Wisden Leading Cricketer in the World in 2011 and 2015.[21][22] He is one of two players to have won this award twice, along with Indian opener Virender Sehwag, who won the award in 2008 and 2009.[23]\n\nIn June 2015 Sangakkara announced he would retire from international cricket after the conclusion of the second Test against India in August.[24]\n\nEarly life\n\nKumar “Sanga” Sangakkara was born to Kumari Surangana and Swarnakumara Sangakkara, an attorney-at-law at Matale, Sri Lanka in 1977.[25] His parents settled in Kandy, where he grew up in his childhood. Kumar received his primary and secondary education at Trinity College, Kandy, an independent elite private boys’ school situated in the central highlands of Sri Lanka. He has two sisters: Thushari and Saranga, and an elder brother: Vemindra, all who have made national level achievements during their school-life. Sangakkara too started playing a number of sports: badminton, tennis, swimming, table tennis and cricket at the junior school. He was able to win national colours for badminton and tennis at his younger age. The then principal of the Trinity College, Leonard de Alwis, advised his mother to encourage Kumar to concentrate on cricket.[26]\n\nHis parents hid Tamil families during the Black July riots in 1983.[27]\n\nHe represented his school’s under-13 cricket XI under coach Upananda Jayasundera.[25] Berty Wijesinghe coached Sangakkara for under-15, under-17, under-19 and first XI squads.[28] He was awarded The Trinity Lion, the most prestigious prize awarded to a Trinity sportsman, for his exceptional batting and wicket-keeping skills in the 1996 season, at the age of 19.[29] Sangakkara was selected to represent Sri Lanka A cricket team at a tour to South Africa in 1998–99. His knock of unbeaten 156 against Zimbabwe A team at a one-day match,[30] helped him secure a place at the Sri Lankan national cricket team later that year.\n\nSanga was the Senior Prefect (Head Boy) of school, he did his Advanced Level examination in the Arts stream in 1996. He was also awarded the highest honour of Trinity College, the Ryde Gold Medal, for the best all-round student in his year. Following his father, who is a lawyer in Kandy, he entered the Law Faculty of the University of Colombo, but was unable to finish his degree due to cricket tours.[31] Kumar was a chorister and played the violin during his school-days.[32] He was cited as an inspiration to continue his higher education by Bangladeshi captain Mushfiqur Rahim, upon receiving his Master’s degree:\n\nIt is appreciated that someone like Sangakkara’s sports personality is shaped by his education. He is obviously an inspiration.[33]\n\nInternational career\n\nEarly career\n\nAt the age of 22 Sangakkara made his Test debut on 20 July 2000, keeping wicket in the first fixture of a three-match series against South Africa. Sri Lanka won the match and in his side’s only innings Sangakarra batted at the fall of the third wicket and scored 23 runs before he was dismissed leg before wicket by spin bowler Nicky Boje.[34] He made 35 runs in his One day cricket debut[35][36] against Pakistan and he received his first man of the match award in the 2nd match of the Singer Triangular Series, 2000, scoring 85 runs against South Africa.[37] He ended the series with 199 runs, at an average of 66.33, securing his place for the upcoming Test series against South Africa. Before reaching his first Test century, he was twice dismissed in the 90s, once against each of South Africa and England. In August 2001, India toured Sri Lanka for three Tests and in the opening match Sangakkara scored his first century.[38] His innings of 105 not out atnumber three helped set up a ten-wicket victory for Sri Lanka.[39] Later that year Sangakkara scored his second Test century, this time in the first of three matches against the touring West Indians.[40]\n\nHe scored his first double-century against Pakistan in 2002, at the 2nd Asian Test Championship final.[41] His performance helped Sri Lanka secure the Test championship. In April 2003, Sangakkara made his first ODI century against Pakistan, in a losing effort.[42] Together with Marvan Atapattu, he made a partnership of 438 for the 2nd wicket—4th highest in the world—against Zimbabwe in 2004.[43] In that game, he scored 270, his first 250+ score.[44] In July 2005, he was selected to the ICC World XI ODI team but missed out from its Test counterpart.\n\nAs vice-captain\n\nWhen Sri Lanka toured Bangladesh in February 2006 regular captain Marvan Atapattu was injured and Mahela Jayawardene became captain while Sangakkara was made vice-captain.[45] Pakistan toured Sri Lanka for two Test and three ODIs in March 2006, and with Atapattu still injured Jayawardene and Sangakkara remained captain and vice-captain respectively.[46] The pair had only expected to hold the positions on an interim basis, but extended into a third series as Atapattu failed to recover in time to tour England in April and ended up filling the roles full-time.[47] In July 2006, Sangakkara made his second-highest Test score to-date (287) against South Africa. In a record-breaking partnership with Mahela Jayawardene, he set up the world record for the highset partnership in Test cricket—624 runs—in this match.[48]\n\nOn 6 December 2007 he made it to the top spot of ICC Test player rankings with a rating of 938, the highest rating ever achieved by a Sri Lankan player, and became the first batsman ever to score in excess of 150 in four consecutive tests.[25] His skill was recognised worldwide when he earned selection for the ICC World XI One Day International team that competed against Australia in the Johnnie Walker Series in October 2005. Despite the World XI losing all of the one-day games by considerable margins, Sangakkara left the series with some credit, averaging 46. He was one of the winners of the 2008 inaugural Cricinfo awards for outstanding batting in Test cricket.[49]\n\nSangakkara holds the record for being the fastest man to 8,000, 9,000, 10,000 (jointly held), 11,000 and 12,000 runs in Test cricket. During Sri Lanka’s tour to England in May 2006, he was named the vice-captain of the side. On 3 March 2009, a terrorist attack on the Sri Lankan team convoy in Pakistan injured 6 Sri Lankan players including Sangakkara. Sangakkara suffered shrapnel wounds in his shoulder.[50] In November 2006, Sangakkara was included in the ICC World XI Test team. Next year, he signed an agreement to join Warwickshire County Cricket Club.[51] That year, he scored back-to-back double centuries in Tests and became only the fifth cricketer in the history to do so.[52]\n\nCaptaincy\n\nSangakkara’s record as captain Matches Won Lost Drawn No result Test[53] 15 5 3 7 – ODI[54] 45 27 14 – 4 T20I[55] 21 12 9 – –\n\nIn February 2009, the then captain of the Sri Lankan side, Mahela Jayawardene announced that he would step down from captaincy “in the best interests of the Sri Lankan team”. He said he believed that it would give his successor around two years to build up to the 2011 Cricket World Cup.[56] Therefore at the age of 31 and with the experience of 80 Tests and 246 ODIs, Sangakkara succeeded Jayawardene as Sri Lanka’s captain in all formats of the game. His first engagement in the role was the 2009 ICC World Twenty20 hosted by England in June.[57] Sri Lanka became runners-up in the series after winning all the game in group and knock-out stages and being defeated by Pakistan in the final. Sangakkara made 64 not-out in the final, but was unable to take Sri Lanka for the championship.[58] Sri Lanka failed to reach to the knock-out stage of the ICC Champions Trophy in September 2009. The next Indian tour proved to be disastrous for the team, with Sri Lanka being beaten by India in Test series 2–0 and ODI series 3–1.\n\nSri Lankan team under the captaincy of Sangakkara gained momentum and won the next Tri-series in Bangladesh, Zimbabwe and Sri Lanka, beating India as well. The Sri Lankans’ tour of Australia proved to be very successful, in winning both the T20 and ODI series. This was Sri Lanka’s first ever series victory in Australia.[59]\n\nA month in advance of the 2011 World Cup in March, Sangakkara decided that he would resign the captaincy after the tournament.[60] Sri Lanka reached the final of the tournament.[61] Throughout the tournament Sangakkara was in prolific form with the bat scoring 465 runs from 9 matches and was the third highest run scorer behind team-mateTillakaratne Dilshan and India’s Sachin Tendulkar. Days after guiding Sri Lanka to the finals of the World Cup, Sangakkara announced to the public he was stepping down as captain of the T20 and ODI teams. He offered to continue as Test captain if deemed necessary for transition to new skipper;[62] in the event Dilshan was appointed captain across all formats.[63] Reflecting on the decision afterwards, he said that “captaining Sri Lanka is a job that ages you very quickly … It’s rarely a job you will last long in … I also had a two-year stint, and I enjoyed it at times, certainly on the field where our results showed we were one of the top two sides in the world for one-and-a-half years, especially in the shorter form of the game.”[60]\n\nThe same year, he was named the ODI Cricketer of the Year at the ICC awards ceremony.[64] In 2012, he was honoured as one of the Wisden Cricketers of the Year.[65]\n\nPost-captaincy\n\nSri Lanka’s first fixture after the World Cup was a Sri Lanka tour of England in 2011 beginning in May. During the second match of a three Test series Tillakaratne Dilshan, Sangakkara’s successor as captain, suffered a broken thumb. Sangakkara filled-in while Dilshan was off the pitch and formally assumed the captaincy for the final Test.[66][67] The match ended in a draw and the series ended in a 1–0 victory for England; Sangakarra scored a century in the match, his first against England in nine Tests.[68]\n\nSangakkara’s results in international matches[69] Matches Won Lost Drawn Tied No result Test[70] 133* 53 42 37 0 – ODI[71] 404 217 167 – 2 17 T20I[72] 56 34 20 – 1 1\n\nSangakkara was named the man of the series in Test series with Pakistan in 2011/12—his first man of the series award in Test cricket. He made 516 runs in the 3 match series which was won by Pakistan 1–0.[73] On August in 2013, he was named the ODI Cricketer of the Year, wicket keeper-captain of the ICC World XI Test team, and won the ICC People’s Choice Award in 2011 ICC Awards.[64] In 2012, he was named one of the Wisden’s five Cricketer’s of the Year.[65]\n\nSangakkara struggled when England toured Sri Lanka in 2012. He failed to score a half century during The Two Test match series. But he regained his form in the ODI series against Pakistan where he twice scored in the 90s. In the following Test series Sangakkara continued his form with a 199, the scoreboard originally said he had scored the double century but it turned out to be a mistake. Sri Lanka later won the Test match. He followed this up with 192 in the game, again missing out on the double century. Sri Lanka drew the next two matches meaning Sri Lanka won the series 1–0. The first time they won a Test series since the retirement of Muttiah Muralitharan.\n\nOn the Sri Lankan tour of Bangladesh in 2014, Sangakarra hit his highest test score to date with 319 in the first innings of the second test.[74] Making him only the third Sri Lankan player to hit a triple century after Sanath Jayasuria and Mahela Jayawardena. He followed his triple century with a knock of 105 in the 2nd innings as game finished as a draw. He continued his good batting run with another century in the 2nd ODI.\n\nHis impressive form with the bat continued at the 2014 Asia Cup where he amassed a total of 245 runs in five innings. He started the tournament with a 63 against Pakistan before hitting a match winning 103 against India. He then added scores of 77 and 2 against Afghanistan and Bangladesh before being dismissed for a golden duck in the final against Pakistan. Sri Lanka went on to win the game and the tournament.[75]\n\nSangakkara decided to retire from T20 internationals after playing the 2014 ICC World Twenty20. Afterwards Jayawardene also followed him into retirement. Sangakkara under performed in the World T20, but in the final match against India, he scored 51 runs not out off just 33 balls making his team win their second ICC trophy since 1996.\n\nSri Lanka played their first 7-match ODI series at home, against England from 26 November to 16 December 2014. During the series, on December 3, 2014 he completed 13,000 runs in One-day internationals in the third match of the series at the Mahinda Rajapaksa International Stadium, Hambantota, and became the fourth player in one-day history to achieve that feat after Sachin Tendulkar, Ricky Ponting, and Sanath Jayasuriya. He also became the second most prolific half-century maker in One-day internationals during this match. He scored 4 consecutive half-centuries followed by a century in this series. On 13 December 2014, he scored his 20th ODI century, became the second Sri Lankan to score 20 ODI centuries, after 28 by Sanath Jayasuriya, and 9th overall to do so. He also took 4 catches as a wicket-keeper in this match, became the player of the match.[76] This match was his last match in his home town, due to his retirement from ODI arena after 2015 Cricket World Cup.\n\nHis last One-Day innings in Sri Lanka was played on 13 December 2014 in the last match of England ODI series. He was caught on 33 in his last innings in home soil.[77]\n\nOn 4 January 2015, Sangakkara scored his 38th test century by making 203 against New Zealand during the second match of the 2 test match series.[78] With this feat, he is only one short to become the highest double-century maker in test history. He has 11 test double centuries, only one short of 12 double centuries by Don Bradman.[79] He also surpassed 12,000 runs in test cricket, becoming the first Sri Lankan and 5th overall to achieve that mark.[80]\n\nOn 14 February 2015, Sangakkara became the second highest run scorer in One-Day International history, by surpassing AustralianRicky Ponting. He achieved this feat during the first match of 2015 ICC Cricket World Cup against New Zealand, but Sri Lanka lost the match.[81]\n\nOn 26 February 2015 in 2015 ICC Cricket World Cup against Bangladesh, Sangakkara scored his 22nd ODI century in his 400th appearance in One-Day Internationals. The 210* second wicket partnership between Sangakkara and Tillakaratne Dilshan on that day was broken again on 1 March 2015, in the next group match in World Cup against England, where Sangakkara joined Lahiru Thirimannewith 212* for the second wicket. Sangakkara scored his 23rd century in this match and this 70 ball century was his fastest century overall and the fastest century by a Sri Lankan in World Cups.[82][83]\n\nDuring the same world cup, against Australia, when chasing massive 377 score, Sangakkara passed 14,000 ODI runs, becoming the first Sri Lankan and second overall to pass it.[84] He scored 124 runs in the next match against Scotland, becoming first batsman in World Cup history to score 4 consecutive hundreds.[85]\n\nThe last ODI innings of Sangakkara was a disappointing from him and his teams’ point of view, where Sri Lanka lost the quarter-final against South Africa on 18 March 2015. He only scored 45 runs, where it was Sri Lanka’s first World Cup defeat in a quarter final after 1999. His team mate Mahela also retired from ODI career with this match.[86]\n\nRetirement reconsideration\n\nDuring the 2014 ICC World Twenty20 championship, Sangakkara announced his retirement from Twenty20 International arena after the championship with his fellow team mate Mahela. Then in 2014 December, he announced he will also retire from ODI cricket after 2015 Cricket World Cup again with Mahela. As he said, he retired from T20I arena on April 2014 and from ODI cricket on 18 March 2015. [87]\n\nOn 1 April 2015, Sri Lanka’s Sports Minister Navin Dissanayake stated that Sangakkara should reconsider his intention to retire in August 2015. He said that Sangakarra was disillusioned by some of the actions of the Sri Lanka Cricket Board in the past, and now that attempts have been made to change personnel and practices, Sangakkara should reconsider his decision. Sangakkara did not gave an answer to the statement.[88]\n\nOn 27 June 2015, Sangakkara officially announced his retirement from Test cricket as well. He will retire from Test cricket after the second Test match against India.[89][90]\n\nCowdrey Lecture\n\nKumar Sangakkara delivered the 2011 MCC Spirit of Cricket Cowdrey Lecture at Lords.[12] He became the youngest person and the first current international player to deliver that lecture, which was widely praised by the cricketing community.[13][14][91] The one-hour-long speech was based on the history and the corruption in the cricket administration in Sri Lanka. In his speech, he said: “accountability and transparency in administration and credibility of conduct were lost in a mad power struggle that would leave Sri Lankan cricket with no clear, consistent administration”, and observed that these problems in administration had risen only after Sri Lanka’s 1996 Cricket World Cup victory.[92] He also blamed “a handful of well-meaning individuals” who control the game, wasting the cricket board‘s finances and resources. Immediately after the lecture, the Sri Lankan sports ministerMahindananda Aluthgamage ordered an investigation into the speech.[93] Despite the critical comments by the Sri Lankan government officials, it has been described as “the most important speech in cricket history”.[94] In the 2015 O/L syllabus, the English Literature Text book has added this lecture as one of its lessons.\n\nBeyond Cricket\n\nAfter his retirement from ODI cricket in 2015, Sangakkara became the Leading Wisden Cricketer of the year 2014 for his impressive cricket career. With this award, he was second only to Indian Virender Sehwag, to win the Wisden Leading cricketer award twice, both in 2011 and 2015. He also won the award for Outstanding Contribution to Sport at the 5th Asian Awards, which were held in London on 17 April 2015.[95]\n\nDomestic cricket\n\nSangakkara plays his domestic cricket for Nondescripts in Sri Lanka.\n\nCounty cricket\n\nSangakkara has played English county cricket with Warwickshire in the 2007 County Championship. In 2010 Sangakkara was contracted to represent Lancashire in the 2010 County Championship,[96] but never represented the club because of international commitments.[97] For the 2015 and 2016 seasons Sangakkara has contracted to play forSurrey.[98]\n\nIndian Premier League\n\nKumar Sangakkara has played in five seasons of the Indian Premier League. Winning bids for him in 2008 and 2011 were US$700,000 by Kings XI Punjab and US$300,000 byDeccan Chargers respectively. He was the captain of the Sunrisers Hyderabad team. Sangakkara has scored 1567 runs with 10 half-centuries in 62 matches in IPL.[99]\n\nSri Lanka Premier League\n\nIn the Sri Lanka Premier League which officially started in 2012, Kumar Sangakkara was named the captain and icon player of the Kandurata Warriors franchise. Unfortunately he couldn’t participate as a player in the inaugural edition in 2012 as he suffered a finger injury weeks before the tournament during a One Day International against India. However, he appeared as a television commentator during some matches.\n\nCaribbean Premier League\n\nOn August 18, 2013, Sangakkarra joined the Jamaica Tallawahs of the Caribbean Premier League.[100]\n\nReturn to county cricket\n\nBefore Sri Lanka’s test series against England in 2014, Sangakkara returned to county cricket, playing two matches for Durham,[101] which included 159 against Sussex in his final innings. On 16 January 2015, it was announced that he would be joining Surrey on a two-year contract.[102] Sangakkara scored a brilliant century against Glamorgan, where he scored 149 runs, which was his maiden century for Surrey in this county season. After the match, he said that he is willing to see the comeback of English batsman Kevin Pietersen to the international cricket[103][104]\n\nPersonal life\n\nSangakkara is married to his longtime partner, Yehali.[105] They have twins, a girl and a boy: Swyree and Kavith.[106]\n\nHe is involved in a number of charity work in Sri Lanka. He is a member of the Think Wise Initiative, launched by International Cricket Council, Joint United Nations Programme on HIV/AIDS and UNICEF, which is aimed at raising awareness around HIV prevention and eliminating discrimination against people living with HIV and AIDS.[107] He is also a partner of the Foundation of Goodness, a charity launched by Muttiah Muralitharan.[31]\n\nPlaying style\n\nSangakkara is a left-handed top order batsman who likes to hit the ball square of the wicket on the off-side. While the cut and the pull are natural strokes to him, he tends to play off the front foot. The cover drive is one of his regular scoring shots. Sangakkara averages 58.66 in Test cricket. In ODI cricket, he retired with an average of 42.[108] Sangakkara handed over his wicket-keeping duty to Prasanna Jayawardene in Tests cricket in 2009. He currently plays as a specialist batsman in Tests, and retired as a wicket keeper-batsman in other formats of the game. He is the first in the list of wicket keepers who contributed to the most number of dismissals in ODI cricket, With 499. He is also the wicket keeper with highest number of stumpings—99—in ODI cricket.[109]\n\nHe has won a certain degree of admiration for his clever use of sledging and is one of few cricketers who are willing to talk about it openly. In an interview in 2004 he explained his approach to sledging:\n\nThe public perception of sledging is to go out there and abuse someone in obscene language, questioning their parentage or sexual preferences. That kind of abuse does not belong on the field of play. Sledging, as coined and pioneered by the Australians, is a measured comment designed to get a reaction out of a player. It could be any reaction: a bit of anger, a show of arrogance, a comment, a shake of the head, or a slump of the shoulders.\n\n—Kumar Sangakkara in 2004[110]\n\nInternational Records\n\nWorld records are bold\n\nTests\n\nHighest aggregate of runs- Sangakkara (12,271) in 131 matches at an Average of 58.43\n\nMost double centuries in a career – Sangakkara has 11 double centuries in tests, second only to 12 double centuries by Don Bradman.\n\nMost number of centuries – Sangakkara has 38 centuries in 131 matches.

According to the Brookings Institution, Colombo has a population of 5.6 million metropolitan area,[4][5][6][7][8] and 555,031[2] in the City proper. It is the financial centre of the island and a popular tourist destination. It is located on the west coast of the island and adjacent to Sri Jayawardenepura Kotte, the legislative capital of Sri Lanka. Colombo is often referred to as the capital since Sri Jayawardenepura Kotte is within the urban area of, and a satellite city of, Colombo. It is also the administrative capital ofWestern Province, Sri Lanka and the district capital of Colombo District. Colombo is a busy and vibrant place with a mixture of modern life and colonial buildings and ruins.[9] It was the legislative capital of Sri Lanka until 1982.\n\nDue to its large harbour and its strategic position along the East-West sea trade routes, Colombo was known to ancient traders 2,000 years ago. It was made the capital of the island when Sri Lanka was ceded to the British Empire in 1815,[10] and its status as capital was retained when the nation became independent in 1948. In 1978, when administrative functions were moved to Sri Jayawardenepura Kotte, Colombo was designated as the commercial capital of Sri Lanka.\n\nLike many cities, Colombo’s urban area extends well beyond the boundaries of a single local authority, encompassing othermunicipal and urban councils such as Sri Jayawardenepura Kotte Municipal Council, Dehiwala Mount Lavinia Municipal Council, Kolonnawa Urban Council and Kotikawatte Mulleriyawa Pradeshiya Sabha. The main city is home to a majority of Sri Lanka’s corporate offices, restaurants and entertainment venues.[11] Famous landmarks in Colombo include Galle Face Green,Viharamahadevi Park, Beira Lake, Colombo Racecourse, Planetarium, Mount Lavinia beach as well as the National Museum\n\nEtymology\n\nThe name “Colombo”, first introduced by the Portuguese in 1505, is believed to be derived from the classical Sinhalese name කොලොන් තොට Kolon thota, meaning “port on the river Kelani“.[12]\n\nAnother belief is that the name is derived from the Sinhalese name කොල-අඹ-තොට Kola-amba-thotawhich means “Harbour with leafy mango trees”.[11]\n\nThe author of the oldest Sinhalese grammar, Sidatsangarava, written in the 13th century wrote about a category of words that exclusively belonged to early Sinhalese. It lists naramba (to see) andkolamba (ford or habor) as belonging to an indigenous source. Kolamba may also be the source of the name of the commercial capital Colombo.[13][14]\n\nHistory\n\nAs Colombo possesses a natural harbour, it was known to Indian, Greeks, Persians, Romans, Arabs, and Chinese traders over 2,000 years ago. Traveller Ibn Batuta who visited the island in the 14th century, referred to it as Kalanpu.[15] Arabs, whose prime interests were trade, began to settle in Colombo around the 8th century AD mostly because the port helped their business by the way of controlling much of the trade between the Sinhalese kingdoms and the outside world. Their descendants now comprise the localSri Lankan Moor community.[10][16]\n\nAncient Era[edit]\n\n[citation needed]\n\nThe first ever mention of Sri Lanka is seen in the great Indian epics Ramayana and Mahabharat. The fortress was situated on a plateau between three mountain peaks known as the Trikuta Mountains. The ancient city of Lankapura is thought to have been burnt down by Lord Hanuman. After the King Ravana was killed by Rama with the help of the former’s brother Vibhishana, Vibhishana was crowned King of Lankapura. The mythological Lankapuri or lanka is identified today as Sri Lanka. Lanka was originally ruled by a Rakshasa named Sumali. Later it was taken by Visarvana who was a Yaksha. From him, Rakshasa Ravana, took the rulership of Lanka. Rama killed Ravana and installed his brother Vibhishana on the throne of Lanka. According to both the Ramayana and the Mahabharata, the Yaksha king Vaisravana alias Kubera was the ruler of Lanka. His capital was guarded by Rakshasas. His half-brother Ravana (son of the sage Vishravaya and Sumali’s daughter) fought with Kubera in battle and obtained the sovereignty of Lanka from him. Ravana ruled Lanka as the king of Rakshasas. Having slain the king of the Rakshasas, viz Ravana, with his brother Kumbhakarna, and sons and kindred, Rama installed in the kingdom of Lanka the Rakshasa chief, Vibhishana, pious, and reverent, and kind to devoted dependents. The battle in Lanka is depicted in a famous bas-relief in the 12th century Khmer temple of Angkor Wat.\n\nPortuguese Era\n\nPortuguese explorers led by Dom Lourenço de Almeida first arrived in Sri Lanka in 1505. During their initial visit they made a treaty with the King of Kotte, Parakramabahu VIII(1484–1508), which enabled them to trade in the island’s crop of cinnamon, which lay along the coastal areas of the island, including in Colombo.[17] As part of the treaty, the Portuguese were given full authority over the coastline in exchange for the promise of guarding the coast against invaders. They were allowed to establish a trading post in Colombo.[17] Within a short time, however, they expelled the Muslim inhabitants of Colombo and began to build a fort in 1517.\n\nThe Portuguese soon realized that control of Sri Lanka was necessary for protection of their coastal establishments in India and they began to manipulate the rulers of the Kotte kingdom to gain control of the area. After skilfully exploiting rivalries within the royal family, they took control of a large area of the kingdom and the Sinhalese King Mayadunne established a new kingdom at Sitawaka, a domain in the Kotte kingdom.[17] Before long he annexed much of the Kotte kingdom and forced the Portuguese to retreat to Colombo, which was repeatedly besieged by Mayadunne and the later kings of Sitawaka, forcing them to seek reinforcement from their major base in Goa, India. Following the fall of the kingdom in 1593, the Portuguese were able to establish complete control over the coastal area, with Colombo as their capital.[17][18] This part of Colombo is still known as Fortand houses the presidential palace and the majority of Colombo’s five star hotels. The area immediately outside Fort is known as Pettah (Sinhala පිට කොටුව piṭa koṭuva, “outer fort”) and is a commercial hub.\n\nDutch Era\n\nIn 1638 the Dutch signed a treaty with King Rajasinha II of Kandy which assured the king assistance in his war against the Portuguese in exchange for a monopoly of the island’s major trade goods. The Portuguese resisted the Dutch and the Kandyans but were gradually defeated in their strongholds beginning in 1639.[19] The Dutch captured Colombo in 1656 after an epic siege, at the end of which a mere 93 Portuguese survivors were given safe conduct out of the fort. Although the Dutch (e.g., Rijcklof van Goens) initially restored the captured area back to the Sinhalese kings, they later refused to turn them over and gained control over the island’s richest cinnamon lands including Colombo which then served as the capital of the Dutch maritime provinces under the control of the Dutch East India Company until 1796.[19][20]\n\nBritish era\n\nAlthough the British captured Colombo in 1796, it remained a British military outpost until the Kandyan Kingdom was ceded to them in 1815 and they made Colombo the capital of their newly created crown colony of British Ceylon. Unlike the Portuguese and Dutch before them, whose primary use of Colombo was as a military fort, the British began constructing houses and other civilian structures around the fort, giving rise to the current City of Colombo.[10]\n\nInitially, they placed the administration of the city under a “Collector”, and John Macdowell of the Madras Service was the first to hold the office. Then, in 1833, the Government Agent of the Western Province was charged with the administration of the city. Centuries of colonial rule had meant a decline of indigenous administration of Colombo, and in 1865 the British conceived a Municipal Council as a means of training the local population in self-governance. The Legislative Council of Ceylon constituted the Colombo Municipal Council in 1865 and the Council met for the first time on the January 16, 1866. At the time, the population of the region was around 80,000.[10]\n\nDuring the time they were in control of the Colombo, the British were responsible for much of the planning of the present city. In some parts of the city tram car tracks and granite flooring laid during the era are still visible today.[20][21]\n\nAfter independence\n\nThis era of colonialism ended peacefully in 1948 when Ceylon gained independence from Britain.[22] Due to the tremendous impact this caused on the city’s inhabitants and on the country as a whole, the changes that resulted at the end of the colonial period were drastic. An entire new culture took root. Changes in laws and customs, clothing styles, religions and proper names were a significant result of the colonial era.[22] These cultural changes were followed by the strengthening of the island’s economy. Even today, the influence of the Portuguese, the Dutch and the British is clearly visible in Colombo’s architecture, names, clothing, food, language and attitudes. Buildings from all three eras stand as reminders of the turbulent past of Colombo. The city and its people show an interesting mix of European clothing and lifestyles together with local customs.[22]\n\nHistorically, Colombo referred to the area around the Fort and Pettah Market which is famous for the variety of products available as well as the Khan Clock Tower, a local landmark. At present, it refers to the city limits of the Colombo Municipal Council.[23] More often, the name is used for the Conurbation known as Greater Colombo, which encompasses several Municipal councils including Kotte, Dehiwela and Colombo.\n\nAlthough Colombo lost its status as the capital of Sri Lanka in the 1980s, it continues to be the island’s commercial centre. Despite the official capital of Sri Lanka moving to the adjacent Sri Jayawardanapura Kotte, most countries still maintain their diplomatic missions in Colombo.[24]\n\nGeography\n\nColombo’s geography is a mix of land and water. The city has many canals and, in the heart of the city, the 65-hectare (160-acre) Beira Lake.[25] The lake is one of the most distinctive landmarks of Colombo, and was used for centuries by colonists to defend the city.[25] It remains a popular attraction, hosting regattas,[26] and theatrical events on its shores. The Northern and North-Eastern border of the city of Colombo is formed by the Kelani River, which meets the sea in a part of the city known as the Modera (mōdara in Sinhala) which means river delta.\n\nClimate\n\nColombo features a tropical monsoon climate under the Köppen climate classification, falling just short of a tropical rainforest climate. Colombo’s climate is fairly temperate all throughout the year. From March to April the temperature averages around 31 degrees Celsius (88 degrees Fahrenheit) maximum.[27] The only major change in the Colombo weather occurs during the monsoon seasons from May to August and October to January. This is the time of year where heavy rains can be expected. Colombo sees little relative diurnal range of temperature, although this is more marked in the drier winter months, where minimum temperatures average 22 degrees Celsius (72 degrees Fahrenheit). Rainfall in the city averages around 2,400 millimetres (94 in) a year.[28]\n\n[hide]Climate data for Colombo, Sri Lanka Month Jan Feb Mar Apr May Jun Jul Aug Sep Oct Nov Dec Year Record high, °C (°F) 35.2\n\n(95.4) 35.6\n\n(96.1) 36.0\n\n(96.8) 35.2\n\n(95.4) 32.8\n\n(91) 33.5\n\n(92.3) 32.2\n\n(90) 32.2\n\n(90) 32.2\n\n(90) 33.6\n\n(92.5) 34.0\n\n(93.2) 34.2\n\n(93.6) 36.0\n\n(96.8) Average high, °C (°F) 30.9\n\n(87.6) 31.2\n\n(88.2) 31.7\n\n(89.1) 31.8\n\n(89.2) 31.1\n\n(88) 30.4\n\n(86.7) 30.0\n\n(86) 30.0\n\n(86) 30.2\n\n(86.4) 30.0\n\n(86) 30.1\n\n(86.2) 30.3\n\n(86.5) 30.64\n\n(87.16) Daily mean, °C (°F) 26.6\n\n(79.9) 26.9\n\n(80.4) 27.7\n\n(81.9) 28.2\n\n(82.8) 28.3\n\n(82.9) 27.9\n\n(82.2) 27.6\n\n(81.7) 27.6\n\n(81.7) 27.5\n\n(81.5) 27.0\n\n(80.6) 26.7\n\n(80.1) 26.6\n\n(79.9) 27.38\n\n(81.3) Average low, °C (°F) 22.3\n\n(72.1) 22.6\n\n(72.7) 23.7\n\n(74.7) 24.6\n\n(76.3) 25.5\n\n(77.9) 25.5\n\n(77.9) 25.2\n\n(77.4) 25.1\n\n(77.2) 24.8\n\n(76.6) 24.0\n\n(75.2) 23.2\n\n(73.8) 22.8\n\n(73) 24.11\n\n(75.4) Record low, °C (°F) 16.4\n\n(61.5) 18.9\n\n(66) 17.7\n\n(63.9) 21.2\n\n(70.2) 20.7\n\n(69.3) 21.4\n\n(70.5) 21.4\n\n(70.5) 21.6\n\n(70.9) 21.2\n\n(70.2) 21.0\n\n(69.8) 18.6\n\n(65.5) 18.1\n\n(64.6) 16.4\n\n(61.5) Average precipitation, mm (inches) 58.2\n\n(2.291) 72.7\n\n(2.862) 128.0\n\n(5.039) 245.6\n\n(9.669) 392.4\n\n(15.449) 184.9\n\n(7.28) 121.9\n\n(4.799) 119.5\n\n(4.705) 245.4\n\n(9.661) 365.4\n\n(14.386) 414.4\n\n(16.315) 175.3\n\n(6.902) 2,523.7\n\n(99.358) Average precipitation days 5 5 9 14 16 16 12 11 15 17 15 10 145 Average relative humidity, % 69 69 71 75 78 79 78 77 78 78 76 73 75 Mean monthly sunshine hours 248.0 248.6 275.9 234.0 201.5 195.0 201.5 201.5 189.0 201.5 210.0 217.0 2,623.5 Source #1: World Meteorological Organization,[29] Hong Kong Observatory[30] Source #2: NOAA[31]\n\nAttractions\n\nGalle Face Green is a ribbon of green space located in the heart of the city along the Indian Ocean coast, and is a popular destination for tourists and residents alike. The Galle Face Hotel is a historic landmark on the southern edge of this promenade.\n\nGangaramaya Temple is one of the most important temples in Colombo. The temple’s architecture demonstrates an eclectic mix of Sri Lankan, Thai, Indian, and Chinese architecture.\n\nThe Viharamahadevi Park (formerly Victoria Park) is an urban park located next to the National Museum of Colombo and the Town Hall. It is the oldest and largest park in Colombo and features a large Buddha statue.\n\nAs part of the Urban Regeneration Program of the Government of Sri Lanka, many old sites and buildings were revamped to modern public recreational spaces and shopping precincts. These include Independence Memorial Hall Square, Pettah Floating Market and Old Dutch Hospital among others.\n\nDemographics\n\nColombo is a multi-ethnic, multi-cultural city. The population of Colombo is a mix of numerous ethnic groups, mainly Sinhalese, Sri Lankan Moors, and Tamils. There are also small communities of people with Chinese, Portuguese, Dutch, Malay, and Indian origins living in the city, as well as numerous European expatriates. Colombo is the most populous city in Sri Lanka, with 642,163 people living within the city limits.[32] In 1866 the city had a population of around 80,000.[33] According to the census of 2001 the demographics of urban Colombo by ethnicity is as follows.[32]\n\nNo Ethnicity Population % Of Total 1 Sinhalese 265,657 41.36 2 Sri Lankan Tamils 185,672 28.91 3 Sri Lankan Moors 153,299 23.87 4 Indian Tamils 13,968 2.17 5 Sri Lankan Malays 11,149 1.73 6 Burghers 5,273 0.82 7 Sri Lankan Chetty 740 0.11 8 Bharatha 471 0.07 9 Other 5,934 0.96 10 Total 642,163 100\n\nGovernment and politics\n\nLocal government\n\nColombo is a charter city, with a Mayor Council form of government. Colombo’s mayor and the council members are elected through local government elections held once in five years. For the past 50 years the city had been ruled by the United National Party (UNP), a right leaning party, whose business friendly policies resonate with the population of Colombo. However the UNP nomination list for the 2006 Municipal elections was rejected,[34] and an Independent Group supported by the UNP won the elections.[35] Uvais Mohamed Imitiyas was subsequently appointed Mayor of Colombo.[36]\n\nThe city government provides sewer, road management and waste management services, in case of water, electricity and telephone utility services the council liaises with the water supply and drainage board, the Ceylon electricity board and telephone service providers.\n\nOfficial vision and mission\n\nVision:\n\n“ Colombo being a model city in Asia, a caring organization looking after interests of citizens and users with an efficient quality service for creation of safe, healthy and wealthy life.[37] ”\n\nMission\n\n“ Organization achieving excellence in providing citizen centred services to the public / customer, optimizing the use of available resources through a competent, motivated and dedicated team.[37] ”\n\nNational capital\n\nColombo was the capital of the Coastal areas controlled by the Portuguese, Dutch and the British from the 1700s to the 1815 when the British gained control of the entire island following the Kandian convention. From then until the 1980s the national capital of the island was Colombo. During the 1980s plans were made to move the administrative capital to Sri Jayawardenepura Kotte and thus move all governmental institutions out of Colombo to make way for commercial activities. As a primary step the Parliament was moved to a new complex in Kotte and several ministries and departments were also moved. However the move was never completed. Today many governmental institutions still remain in Colombo. These include the President’s House, Presidential Secretariat, Prime Minister’s House (Temple Trees), Prime Minister’s Office, the Supreme Court of Sri Lanka, Central Bank of Sri Lanka, important government ministries and departments; such as Finance (Treasury), Defence, Public Administration & Home affairs, Foreign affairs, Justice and theMilitary headquarters, Naval headquarters (SLNS Parakrama), Air Force headquarters (SLAF Colombo) and Police national and field force headquarters.[38][39]\n\nCity limits\n\nColombo is divided into 15 numbered areas for the purposes of postal services. Within these areas are the suburbs with their corresponding post office.\n\nPostal number Inner Suburb Colombo 1 Fort Colombo 2 Slave Island, Union Place Colombo 3 Kollupitiya Colombo 4 Bambalapitiya Colombo 5 Havelock Town, Kirilapone Colombo 6 Wellawatte, Pamankada, Narahenpita Colombo 7 Cinnamon Gardens Colombo 8 Borella Colombo 9 Dematagoda Colombo 10 Maradana, Panchikawatte Colombo 11 Pettah Colombo 12 Hultsdorf Colombo 13 Kotahena, Bloemendhal Colombo 14 Grandpass Colombo 15 Mutwal, Modera, Mattakkuliya, Madampitiya\n\nCapital Zone suburbs\n\nSri Jayawardenepura Kotte Legislature\n\nPita Kotte\n\nEthul Kotte\n\nNawala\n\nNugegoda\n\nRajagiriya\n\nOuter suburbs\n\nBattaramulla\n\nBatuwatta\n\nBoralesgamuwa\n\nDalugama\n\nDehiwala-Mount Lavinia\n\nEkala\n\nHomagama\n\nHokandara\n\nJa-Ela\n\nKadawatha\n\nKaduwela\n\nKandana\n\nKiribathgoda\n\nKolonnawa\n\nKoswatte\n\nKotikawatta\n\nKottawa\n\nMaharagama\n\nMalabe\n\nMoratuwa\n\nPannipitiya\n\nPeliyagoda\n\nPiliyandala\n\nRagama\n\nRatmalana\n\nThalawathugoda\n\nWattala\n\nWickramasinhapura\n\nEconomy\n\nThe great majority of Sri Lankan corporations have their head offices in Colombo including Aitken Spence, Ceylinco Corporation, Stassen group of companies, John Keells Holdings, Hemas Holdings and Akbar Brothers. Some of the industries include chemicals, textiles, glass, cement, leather goods, furniture, and jewellery. In the city centre is the World Trade Centre. The 40 story Twin Tower complex is the centre of important commercial establishments, in the Fort district, the city’s nerve center. Right outside the Fort area is Pettah which is derived from the Sinhalese word pita which means ‘out’ or ‘outside’.[40]\n\nThe Colombo Metropolitan area has a GDP of $48 billion, making it the core of the Sri Lankan economy. The per capita income of Colombo Metro area stood at US$8623 and purchasing power per capita of $25,117, making it one of the most prosperous regions in South Asia considering Western Province contribute for 50% of GDP in Sri Lanka .[41]\n\nThe Colombo Metropolitan (CM) area is the most important industrial, commercial and administrative centre in Sri Lanka. A major share of the country’s export-oriented manufacturing takes place in the CM area which is the engine of growth for Sri Lanka. The Western province contributes more than 50% to the GDP and about 80% of industrial value additions although it accounts for only 5.7% of the country’s geographic area. Given its importance as the primary international gateway for Sri Lanka and as the main economic driver of the country, the government of Sri Lanka (GoSL) has launched an ambitious program to transform Colombo and its area into a metropolis of international standards. Bottlenecks are preventing the Colombo metropolitan area from realizing its full economic potential. To facilitate the transformation of Colombo, the government has to address these bottlenecks which have for long been obstructing economic and physical urban regeneration.[42]\n\nPettah is more crowded than the Fort area. Pettah’s roads are always packed and pavements are full of small stalls selling items from delicious sharbat to shirts. Main Street consists mostly of clothes shops and the cross roads, which are known as Cross Streets where each of the five streets specializes in a specific business. For example, the First Cross Street is mostly electronic goods shops, the Second cellular phones and fancy goods. Most of these businesses are dominated by Muslim traders. At the end of the Main Street further away from Fort is the Sea Street — Sri Lanka’s gold market — dominated by Tamil interests. This mile-long street is full of jewellery shops.[40]\n\nAt one time Air Lanka (now SriLankan Airlines) had its head office in Colombo.[43]\n\nLaw enforcement and crime\n\nThe Sri Lanka Police the main law enforcement agency of the island liaise with the municipal council, but is under the control of theMinistry of Defence of the central government.[44] Policing in Colombo and its suburbs falls within the Metropolitan Range headed by the Deputy Inspector General of Police (Metropolitan), this also includes the Colombo Crime Division.[45] As with most Sri Lankan cities, the magistrate court handles felony crimes, the district court handles civil cases.\n\nAs in other large cities around the world, Colombo experiences certain levels of street crime and bribery. Indeed, the corruption extends to the very top, US reports show. In addition, in the period from the 1980s to 2009 there have been a number of major terrorist attacks.[46][47]The LTTE has been linked to most of the bombings and assassinations in the city.[48] Welikada Prison is situated in Colombo and it is one of the largest maximum-security prisons in the country.[49]\n\nInfrastructure\n\nColombo has most of the amenities that a modern city has. Compared to other parts of the country, Colombo has the highest degree of infrastructure. Electricity, water and transport to street lamps, phone booths, etc. have a considerably good standard. The majority of the major shopping malls in Sri Lanka are in the city, of which all are wi-fi enabled. Apart from that, many luxurious hotels, clubs and restaurants are in the city. In recent times there’s been an outpour of high rise condominiums, mainly due to the very high land prices.[50]\n\nHarbour\n\nColombo Harbour is the largest and one of the busiest ports in Sri Lanka. Colombo was established primarily as a port city during the colonial era, with an artificial harbour that has been expanded over the years. The Sri Lanka Navy maintains a naval base, SLNS Rangalla, within the harbour.\n\nThe Port of Colombo handled 3.75 million twenty-foot equivalent units in 2008, 10.6% up on 2007 (which itself was 9.7% up on 2006), bucking the global economic trend. Of those, 817,000 were local shipments with the rest transshipments. Currently with a capacity of 4.1 million TEUs and a dredged depth of over 15 m (49 ft),[2] the Colombo Harbour is one of the busiest ports in the world, and ranks among the top 35 ports.\n\nTransport\n\nBus\n\nMain article: Colombo Bus Routes\n\nColombo has an extensive public transport system based on buses operated both by private operators and the government owned Sri Lanka Transport Board (SLTB). The three primary bus terminals — Bastian Mawatha, Central, and the Gunasinghapura Bus Terminals — are in Pettah. Bastian Mawatha handles long distance services whereas Gunasinghapura and Central handle local services.\n\nRail\n\nTrain transport in the city is limited since most trains are meant for transport to and from the city rather than within it and are often overcrowded. However, the Central Bus Stand and Fort Railway Station function as the island’s primary hub for bus and rail transport respectively. Up until the 1970s the city had tram services, which were discontinued. Other means of transport includes auto rickshaws (commonly called “three wheelers”) and taxicabs. Three wheelers are entirely operated by individuals and hardly regulated whilst cab services are run by private companies and are metered.\n\nMain Line – Colombo Fort to Veyangoda; onwards to Kandy, Badulla, Matale, Kurunegala,Anuradhapura, Kankesanturai.Trincomalee, Batticaloa, Talaimannar (presently just Madhu Road).\n\nCoastal Line – Colombo to Panadura; onwards to Galle and Matara.\n\nPuttalam Line – Colombo to Ja Ela; onwards to Negombo and Puttalam.\n\nKelani Valley Line – Colombo to Avissawella.\n\nAdvanced stages of feasibility investigations into the Colombo Metro Rail, a Mass Rapid Transit railway system has begun. The project was established to control the excessive traffic. The project is carried out by NEB Rapid Infrastructure Projects Pvt. Ltd., an Indian and Singaporean collaboration.[51][52] Alternatively a monorail system is planned too.[53]\n\nRoads\n\nPost-war development in the Colombo area also involves the construction of numerous expressway grade arterial road routes. The first of these constructed is the Southern Expressway, which goes from Kottawa, a southern suburb of Colombo, to Matara in the south of the country. Expressways under construction in the Colombo metropolitan area include the Colombo–Katunayake Expressway which was opened in October 2013 and the Colombo orbital bypass Outer Circular Highway (Arthur C. Clarke Expressway) which is due to be opened in 2014.[54][55]\n\nA1 highway connects Colombo with Kandy.\n\nA2 highway connects Colombo with Galle.\n\nA3 highway connects Colombo with Negombo.\n\nA4 highway connects Colombo with Ratnapura.\n\nFerry\n\nAn international ferry liner, the Scotia Prince, is conducting a ferry service to Tuticorin, India. Ferry services between the two countries have been revived after more than 20 years.[56]\n\nAir\n\nBandaranaike International Airport and Ratmalana Airport are the city’s airports. Bandaranaike Airport serves the city for most international flights, while the Ratmalana Airport primarily serves local flights.\n\nLandmarks\n\nThe two World Trade Centre towers used to be the most recognized landmarks of the city. Before they were completed in 1997, the adjacent Bank of Ceylon tower was the tallest structure and the most prominent city landmark. Before the skyscrapers were built it was the Old Parliament Building that stood majestically in the Fort district with the Old Colombo Lighthouse close to it. Another important landmark is the Independence Hall at Independence Square in Cinnamon Gardens.\n\nEven before the parliament was built some claim that the Jami Ul-Alfar Mosque was recognized as the landmark of Colombo by sailors approaching the port. The mosque is still one of the most visited tourist sites in Colombo.\n\nAnother landmark is St.Paul’s Church Milagiriya, one of the oldest churches in Sri Lanka, first built by the Portuguese and re-built by the British in 1848.\n\nThe Fort district has the famous Cargills & Millers complex that is protected by a special government law from demolition. This is done mainly to preserve the historic beauty of the Fort area.\n\nThe Galle Face Green is the city’s largest and most elegant promenade. Lined with palm trees and adjacent to the coast, this mile-long stretch in the heart of the city is a constant beehive of activity. The green is especially busy on Fridays and Saturdays. In the evenings it plays host to families and children playing sports andflying kites, lovers embracing under umbrellas and health enthusiasts taking their evening walks. There are numerous small food stalls and a small stretch of beach. The green was recently[when?] given a makeover and since then has been even more popular with the local community. The Green frequently hosts international and local concerts and performances, such as the recently concluded World Drum Festival.\n\nCannons that were once mounted on the rampart of the old fort of Colombo laid out for observance and prestige at the Green, giving a colonial touch to the city. The famous colonial styled Galle Face Hotel, known as Asia’s Emerald on the Green since 1864, is adjacent to Galle Face Green. The hotel has played host to distinguished guests including the British Royal Family and other royal guests and celebrities. After a stay at the hotel, Princess Alexandra of Denmark commented that “the peacefulness and generosity encountered at the Galle Face Hotel cannot be matched.”[57] Also facing Galle Face Green is the Ceylon Inter-Continental Hotel, Sri Lanka’s first five-star hotel. Around the corner from Galle Face are prominent coffee bars, chic bars and boutiques.\n\nEducation\n\nEducation institutions in Colombo have a long history. Colombo has many of the prominent public schools in the country, some of them government-owned and others private. Most of the prominent schools in the city date back to the 1800s when they were established during the British colonial rule,[58] such as the Royal College Colombo established in 1835. Certain urban schools of Sri Lanka have some religious alignment; this is partly due to the influence of British who established Christian missionary schools.[59][60] These include theAnglican, Bishop’s College(1875); the Methodist, Wesley College Colombo (1874); the Buddhist, Ananda College (1886); the Muslim,Zahira College (1892); the Catholic, St. Joseph’s College (1896). The religious alignments do not affect the curriculum of the school except for the demographics of the student population.[59] Colombo has many International Schools that have come up in the recent years.\n\nHigher education in the city has a long history, beginning with the establishment of the Colombo Medical School (1870), the Colombo Law College (1875), School of Agriculture (1884) and the Government Technical College (1893). The first step in the creation of a University in Colombo was taken in 1913 with the establishment of the University College Colombo which prepared students for the external examinations of the University of London. This was followed by the establishment of the University of Ceylon in Colombo.[61] Today the University of Colombo and the University of the Visual & Performing Arts are state universities in the city. The Sri Lanka Institute of Information Technology has a metropolitan campus in the city centre. There are several private higher education institutions in the city.\n\nSee also: Education in Sri Lanka\n\nArchitecture\n\nColombo has wildly varying architecture that span centuries and depict many styles. Colonial buildings influenced by the Portuguese, Dutch andBritish exist alongside structures built in Buddhist, Hindu, Islamic, Indian and Contemporary architectural styles. No other place is this more evident in the Fort area. Here one may find new towering skyscrapers as well as historic buildings dating far back as the 1700s.[62][63]\n\nColombo Fort\n\nThe Portuguese were the first colonists to settle in Colombo; establishing a small trading post, they had laid the foundations for a small fort which in time became the largest colonial fort in the island. The Dutch expanded the fort thus creating a well old fortified harbour. This came into the possession of the British in the late 1700s and by the late 19th century the seeing no threat to the Colombo Harbour, began demolishing the ramparts to make way for the development of the city. Although now there is nothing left of the fortifications, the area which was once the fort is still referred to as Fort. The area outside is Pettah or පිටකොටුව in Sinhalese which means outer fort.[62][63]\n\nDutch-era buildings\n\nThere are none of the buildings of the Portuguese era and only a few from the Dutch period. These include the oldest building in the fort area, the former Dutch Hospital, the Dutch House which is now the Colombo Dutch Museum and several churches. The President’s House(formerly the Queen’s House)was originally the Dutch governor’s house, and successive British governors made it their office and residence. However, it has undergone much change since the Dutch period. Adjoining the President’s House are the Gordon Gardens, now off limits to the public.[62][63][64]\n\nBritish-era buildings\n\nMuch of the old buildings of the fort area and in other parts of the city date back to the British times, these include governmental, commercial buildings and private houses. Some of the notable government building of British colonial architecture includes; the old Parliament building which is now the Presidential Secretariat, the Republic Building which houses the Ministry of Foreign affairs, but once housed the Ceylon Legislative council, the General Treasury Building, the old General Post Office an Edwardian style building opposite the President’s House, the Prime Minister’s Office, the Central Telegraph Office, the Mathematics department of the University of Colombo(formally the Royal College, Colombo).[65] Notable commercial buildings of the British era include the Galle Face Hotel, Cargills & Millers’ complex, and Grand Oriental Hotel.[62][63]\n\nThe Sirimathipaya Mansion of Sir Ernest de Silva which is now the Prime Minister’s Officeis an example of architecture of the British era.\n\nThe historical Cargills & Millers building\n\nCulture\n\nAnnual cultural events and fairs[edit]\n\nColombo’s most beautiful festival is the celebration of Buddha‘s birth, enlightenment and death all falling on the same day.[66] In Sinhala this is known as Vesak.[66] During this festival, much of the city is decorated with lanterns, lights and special displays of light (known asthoran). The festival falls in mid May and lasts a week. Many Sri Lankans visit the city to see the lantern competitions and decorations. During this week people distribute, rice, drinks and other food items for free in dunsal which means charity place. These dunsal are popular amongst visitors from the suburbs.\n\nSince there is a large number of Muslims in Colombo. Eid Ul Fitr and Eid Ul Adha are two Islamic festivals that are celebrated in Colombo. Many businesses flourish during the eventual countdown for Eid Ul Fitr which is a major Islamic festival celebrated by Muslims after a month-long fasting. Colombo is generally very busy during the eve of the festivals as people do their last minute shopping.\n\nChristmas is another major festival. Although Sri Lanka’s Christians make up only just over 7% of the population, Christmas is one of the island’s biggest festivals. Most streets and commercial buildings light up from the beginning of December and festive sales begin at all shopping centres and department stores. Caroling and nativity plays are frequent sights during the season.\n\nThe Sinhala and Hindu Aluth Awurudda’ is a cultural event that takes place on 13 and 14 April. This is the celebration of the Sinhala and Hindu new year. The festivities include many events and traditions that display a great deal of Sri Lankan culture.\n\nSeveral old clubs of the city gives a glimpse of the British equestrian life style, these include the Colombo Club, Orient Club, the 80 Club, the Colombo Cricket Club.\n\nPerforming arts\n\nColombo has several performing arts centers which are popular for their musical and theatrical performances. The most famous performing arts centers are the Lionel Wendt Theatre, the Elphinstone, and Tower Hall, all of which have a very rich history and made for western style productions. The Navarangahala found in the city is the country’s first national theatre designed and build for Asian and local style musical and theatrical productions.\n\nThe Nelum Pokuna Mahinda Rajapaksa Theatre is a world-class theatre that opened in December 2011.[67] Designed in the form of the Lotus Pond in Polonnaruwa, the theatre is a major theatre destination.[68][69]\n\nMuseums and art collections\n\nThe National Museum of Colombo, established on 1 January 1877 during the tenure of the British Colonial Governor Sir William Henry Gregory, is in the Cinnamon Gardens area.[70] The museum houses the crown jewels and throne of the last king of the kingdom of Kandy,Sri Vikrama Rajasinha.[70]\n\nThere is also the Colombo Dutch Museum detailing the Dutch colonial history of the country. Colombo does not boast a very big art gallery. There is a small collection of Sri Lankan masterpieces at the Art Gallery in Green Path; next to it is the Natural History Museum.\n\nSports\n\nUndoubtedly the most popular sport in Sri Lanka is cricket. The country emerged as champions of the 1996 Cricket World Cup and became runners up in 2007 and 2011. In the ICC World Twenty20 they became runners up in 2009 and 2012 and winners in 2014. The sport is played in parks, playgrounds, beaches and even in the streets. Colombo is the home for two of the country’s most popularinternational cricket stadiums, Sinhalese Sports Club‘s cricket stadium and R. Premadasa Stadium (named after late presidentPremadasa).\n\nColombo has the distinction of being the only city in the world to have four cricket test venues in the past: Paikiasothy Saravanamuttu Stadium, Sinhalese Sports Club Ground, Colombo Cricket Club Ground and Ranasinghe Premadasa Stadium. The Sugathadasa Stadiumis an international standard stadium for athletics, swimming and football, also held the South Asian Games in 1991 and 2006. Situated in Colombo the Royal Colombo Golf Club is one of the oldest in Asia. Other sporting clubs in Colombo include Colombo Swimming Club,Colombo Rowing Club and the Yachting Association of Sri Lanka.\n\nRugby is also a popular sport at the club and school level. Colombo has its own local football team Colombo FC and the sport is being developed as a part of the FIFA Goal program.\n\nThe Colombo Port City is to include a new Formula One track, constructed in the vicinity of the Colombo Harbour. According to Dr. Priyath Wickrama, the Chairman of the Sri Lanka Ports Authority, says an eight lane F1 track will “definitely” be a part of the New Port City.This would host The Sri Lankan Grand Prix.\n\nMedia\n\nAlmost all major media businesses in Sri Lanka operate from Colombo. The state media has its offices in Bullers Road and does carry out regional transmission from there. This includes the Sri Lanka Broadcasting Corporation (SLBC), formerly known as Radio Ceylon and theSri Lanka Rupavahini Corporation. The SLBC is the oldest radio station in South Asia and the second oldest in the world. Many of the private broadcasting companies have their offices and transmission stations in or around Colombo. As with most metro areas, radio bands are highly utilised for radio communications. Some of the prominent radio stations broadcasting in the Colombo area are Sirasa FM, FM Derana, Hiru FM, Shakthi FM, Vettri FM, Sooriyan FM, Kiss FM, Lite FM, Yes FM, Gold FM, and many more.\n\nTelevision networks operating in the Colombo metro area include the state-owned television broadcasting networks which are broadcast from the Rupavahini Corporation of Sri Lanka, broadcasting television in the official languages Sinhala and Tamil. English language television is also broadcast, more targeted to the demographics of the English speaking Sri Lankans, expatriate communities and tourists. There are as well several private operators. It is often that many of the privately run television stations networks were based upon operational expansions of pre-existing commercial radio networks and broadcast infrastructure.\n\nSource :Wikipedia"
