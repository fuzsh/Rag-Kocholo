        "text": "2. Materials and methods\n\n2.1. Participants\n\nThis preliminary clinical trial was approved by our Institutional Review Board (no. 2019KT95) and registered on ClinicalTrials.gov ({\"type\":\"clinical-trial\",\"attrs\":{\"text\":\"NCT04750772\",\"term_id\":\"NCT04750772\"}}NCT04750772). Written informed consent was obtained from all participants who were consecutively recruited from the study institution. The inclusion criteria were as follows: age >18 years, histologically confirmed CRC referral to the Nuclear Medicine Department for both [18F]F-FDG and [68Ga]Ga-FAPI-04 PET/CT scans for staging or restaging to aid optimal clinical decision making and provision of written informed consent. Pregnant or lactating women and those with severe liver or kidney dysfunction were excluded. The final cohort comprised 61 participants with CRC. The diagnosis was confirmed through surgery in 25 participants and through endoscopic biopsy in others. All suspicious metastatic lesions were confirmed by histopathology or follow-up for 3–6 months. Histopathology was served as a gold standard reference for the confirmation of the imaging findings by the means of rebiopsy or surgery. If pathological diagnosis was not applicable, conventional imaging (such as CT and MRI, etc.) follow-up for anatomical abnormalities of lesions was performed. Lesions were diagnosed of malignant based on any of the following follow-up criteria: 1) typical malignant features demonstrated by other imaging, especially the contrast-enhanced CT/MRI referred to as the first-line imaging. 2) posttreatment shrinkage or expansion of a suspicious lesion on follow-up imaging indicating improvement or progression, periodic plain CT/MRI scan used as the second-line imaging. 3) Density changes of lesions, such as cortical breakthrough for bone metastases. The finial observation of significant malignant features of suspicious lesions was the follow-up imaging end-point. The study flowchart of participant enrolment is presented in Supplementary Figure 1 .\n\n2.2. Synthesis of [18F]F-FDG and [68Ga]Ga-FAPI-04\n\n[18F]F-FDG was manufactured in accordance with the standard method described by our laboratory using the coincidence [18F]F-FDG synthesis module. The FAPI precursor (DOTA-FAPI-04) was purchased from Huayi Technology Co., Ltd. (China), and synthesis and radiolabelling of [68Ga]Ga-FAPI-04 were performed as previously described (14). The radiochemical purity exceeded 95% for both [18F]F-FDG and [68Ga]Ga-FAPI-04. The final products underwent sterility testing before administration via intravenous injection.\n\n2.3. PET/CT imaging\n\nAll enrolled participants underwent routine [18F]F-FDG PET/CT and subsequent [68Ga]Ga-FAPI-04 PET/CT within 1 week. All participants fasted for at least 6 h before [18F]F-FDG PET/CT, and a blood glucose level of <10 mmol/L was confirmed before tracer injection. Contrastingly, participants on a normal diet were intravenously injected with 1.85–2.96 MBq/kg [68Ga]Ga-FAPI-04 and underwent imaging using a hybrid PET/CT scanner (Biograph mCT Flow 64; Siemens Healthineers USA, Knoxville, TN, USA) after approximately 1 h. The acquisition was commenced in 6–8 bed positions (1 min/bed) covering the area between the top of the skull and upper thigh. Non-contrast-enhanced CT was performed using 100-mA modulation at 120 kV with a 3-mm slice thickness for attenuation correction and anatomical localisation. All data were transferred to the Syngo MultiModality Workplace (version VE40F; Siemens Healthineers) and reconstructed using the ordered subset expectation maximum algorithm to construct display images in the coronal, axial and sagittal planes.\n\n2.4. Safety\n\nVital parameters, including blood pressure, heart rate, temperature and respiration rate, of all participants were carefully monitored during the examination. Any abnormal symptoms (e.g. allergy) were addressed as soon as possible.\n\n2.5. Image analysis\n\nAll the images were reviewed by two groups of physicians with at least 10 years of experience in nuclear medicine and radiology. The physicians in group 1 (X.C. and M.W.) and group 2 (X.L. and X.W.) independently reviewed the [18F]F-FDG and [68Ga]Ga-FAPI-04 PET/CT images, respectively. Reference information from the other group and all other images and clinical data, including CT, MRI, endoscopic and pathological results, were absent. All differing opinions were interpreted and discussed within the groups until a consensus was reached. The inter-reader agreement within the two groups was expressed using the κ value.\n\nVisual assessment was performed, and positive uptake was defined as focal tracer uptake exceeding background uptake. Circular volumes of interest within tumour lesions and healthy tissues were used to quantify radiotracer biodistribution. Tracer uptake was quantified using maximum standardised uptake (SUVmax) values, which was measured by drawing regions of interest around the tumours on transaxial slices that were automatically adapted to a three-dimensional volume of interest with the system software at an 80% isocontour. The normal organs were evaluated using a 1–2-cm-diameter circular sphere. Primary lesions, lymph nodes and distant metastases were analysed. The lymph nodes were classified according to their location as cervical–supraclavicular, thoracic, abdominal and pelvic. The target-to-background ratios (TBRs) of the primary lesions; lymph nodes; and liver, lung, bone and peritoneal metastatic tumours were calculated (the normal transverse colon without physiological uptake, blood pool of the aorta, normal liver tissue, normal lung tissue, L5 and normal mesenterium were used as backgrounds, respectively).\n\nWe used TNM classification based on the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) guidelines (15, 16). In all participants, changes in the TNM stage, metastases localisation and previous oncologic or radio-oncologic management history were recorded.\n\n2.6. Statistical analyses\n\nAll statistical analyses were performed using SPSS 23.0 (IBM, Armonk, NY, USA). Inter-reader agreement was evaluated using Kappa test. The uptakes of positive lesions in [18F]F-FDG and [68Ga]Ga-FAPI-04 PET/CT were compared using Wilcoxon’s signed-rank test. SUVmax and TBR were the main parameters for evaluating the two PET/CT scans, and normally distributed and skewed variables were expressed as means (95% confidence intervals) and medians (ranges), respectively. A two-tailed P value of <0.05 was considered statistically significant.\n\n3. Results\n\n3.1. Participant characteristics\n\nsummarises the clinical characteristics of the 61 participants. The median age of the participants was 62 (range, 32–81) years, and 42 (68.9%) participants were men. The most common histologic grade was moderate differentiation in 35 (57.4%) participants, whereas 8 (13.1%) and 7 (11.5%) participants had mucinous/signet-ring cell carcinoma and adenocarcinoma with a mucinous component, respectively. Overall, 21 (34.4%) participants underwent PET/CT for initial assessment and staging; the remaining 40 (65.6%) underwent PET/CT for restaging or therapeutic evaluation.\n\nTable 1\n\nCharacteristicValueParticipants (n)61Age (years), median (range)62 (32–81)Sex (male:female)42:19Colon cancer26 (42.6%)Rectal cancer35 (57.4%)Treatment status Treatment-naïve21 Neoadjuvant treatment15 Chemotherapy5 Radiotherapy3 Chemotherapy + radiotherapy7 Chemotherapy/radiotherapy after surgery25Pathology Adenocarcinoma (poorly differentiated)8 Adenocarcinoma (moderately differentiated)35 Adenocarcinoma (well-differentiated)3 Mucinous/signet-ring cell carcinoma8 Adenocarcinoma with mucinous component7Purpose of PET/CT Staging21 Restaging/therapeutic evaluation40\n\n3.2. Safety\n\nAll participants tolerated [68Ga]Ga-FAPI-04 PET/CT without any complications. No signs of drug-related side effects were reported during the entire observation period of >5 h.\n\n3.3. Distribution\n\nThe inter-reader agreement between groups 1 and 2 was nearly perfect, and the κ value was >0.8 ( Supplementary Tables 1–4 ). SUVmax was determined for normal tissues/organs and primary tumours after [68Ga]Ga-FAPI-04 and [18F]F-FDG PET/CT, which were sequentially performed for all the participants. [68Ga]Ga-FAPI-04 activity was significantly lower than [18F]F-FDG activity in several normal organs (P < 0.001), especially the brain (SUVmax, 0.3 ± 0.2 vs. 10.0 ± 2.8, P < 0.001) and liver (SUVmax, 1.4 ± 0.4 vs. 2.9 ± 0.5, P < 0.001), leading to significantly high TBRs of >2 in both organs (P < 0.001). Further, [68Ga]Ga-FAPI-04 uptake was higher than [18F]F-FDG uptake in the salivary and thyroid glands and the pancreas (P < 0.001 for all). The detailed distribution of [18F]F-FDG and [68Ga]Ga-FAPI-04 uptakes is presented in .\n\n3.4. Primary tumours\n\nThe histopathological data of the primary tumours were available for all treatment-naïve participants (n = 21) and for those who received neoadjuvant treatment (n = 15). Only 1 of these 36 participants had two primary lesions. Therefore, 37 primary lesions were measured. The sensitivity was 100% (37/37) for both [68Ga]Ga-FAPI-04 and [18F]F-FDG PET/CT. The average SUVmax and median SUVmax (range) of all primary lesions were 9.7 ± 5.4 and 9.7 (2.0–25.5), respectively, on [68Ga]Ga-FAPI-04 PET/CT and 11.4 ± 7.6 and 10.3 (2.4–35.1), respectively, on [18F]F-FDG PET/CT (P = 0.09). The average TBR of all 37 primary lesions was significantly higher on [68Ga]Ga-FAPI-04 PET/CT than on [18F]F-FDG PET/CT (13.3 ± 8.9 and 8.2 ± 6.5, respectively; P < 0.001). The average SUVmax values for [68Ga]Ga-FAPI-04 and [18F]F-FDG were 12.3 ± 4.6 and 14.1 ± 7.3, respectively, in the treatment-naïve group (P = 0.21) and 5.9 ± 4.1 and 7.4 ± 6.5, respectively, in the neoadjuvant radio-chemotherapy group (P = 0.18). The average TBR of the treatment-naïve lesions was significantly higher on [68Ga]Ga-FAPI-04 PET/CT than on [18F]F-FDG PET/CT (17.6 ± 8.5 vs. 10.5 ± 7.2, P = 0.002), whereas the average TBR was not different between the imaging modalities for the post-treatment lesions (7.0 ± 5.0 vs. 5.0 ± 3.4, P = 0.061).\n\nThe analysis of treatment-naïve primary tumours revealed that the avidity of [68Ga]Ga-FAPI-04 (11.4 ± 4.9) was significantly higher than that of [18F]F-FDG (7.9 ± 3.6) in signet-ring/mucinous carcinomas (P = 0.03; ). Additionally, [68Ga]Ga-FAPI-04 uptake was significantly lower than [18F]F-FDG uptake in poorly differentiated carcinomas (average SUVmax, 12.7 ± 3.7 vs. 18.1 ± 4.1; P = 0.04). There was also a significant difference in the SUVmax of primary lesions between [68Ga]Ga-FAPI-04 and [18F]F-FDG PET/CT among well-differentiated and moderately differentiated carcinomas (average SUVmax, 10.8 ± 3.0 vs. 16.2 ± 8.6; P = 0.025). Although the uptake of [68Ga]Ga-FAPI-04 was higher in poorly differentiated carcinomas (12.7 ± 3.7) than in moderately-well differentiated carcinomas (10.8 ± 3.0), no significant difference was noted between them (P = 0.074). Interestingly, in the neoadjuvant chemotherapy group, there was no significant difference in the SUVmax of primary lesions between [68Ga]Ga-FAPI-04 and [18F]F-FDG PET/CT among all carcinoma types (P = 0.182).\n\n3.5. Changes in TNM stage\n\nCompared with staging based on [18F]F-FDG PET/CT, [68Ga]Ga-FAPI-04 PET/CT revealed additional findings in 34 of the 61 participants, which led to changes in staging in 15 participants. Particularly, 6 (28.6%) of the 21 treatment-naïve participants were upstaged and 2 (9.5%) were downstaged ( ).\n\nTable 2\n\nNumberTreatment statusTNM stage (FDG PET-based)TNM stage (FAPI PET-based)Additional finding in FAPI PETReference standardChange in staging2Treatment-naïveT4aN2bM0 (III B)T4aN2bM1c (IV C)Peritoneal metastasisContrast-enhanced MRIUpstage4Treatment-naïveT4aN2bM1c (IV C)T4aN2bM1c (IV C)2 LNsShrinkage after treatment (contrast CT)None5Treatment-naïveT1/2N0M1a (IV A)T1/2N0M0 (I)No rectal metastasisEndoscopic biopsyDownstage6Treatment-naïveT4aN2aM1c (IV C)T4aN2aM1c (IV C)2 LNsShrinkage after treatment (contrast CT)None11Neoadjuvant treatmentyT0N0M1a (IV A)yT0N0M0No small intestinal metastasisEndoscopic biopsyDownstage15Treatment-naïveT3N1bM1a (IV A)T3N1bM1a (IV A)1 LNShrinkage after treatment (contrast CT)None16Treatment-naïveT4bN2bM0 (III C)T4bN2bM0 (III C)5 LNsShrinkage after treatment (contrast CT)None17Treatment-naïveT4aN1bM0 (III B)T4aN1bM0 (III B)1 LNShrinkage after treatment (contrast CT)None20Treatment-naïveT3N2aM1a (IV A)T3N2aM1a (IV A)1 LNShrinkage after treatment (contrast CT)None21Treatment-naïveT4aN1bM0 (III B)T4aN1bM0 (III B)1 LNSurgeryNone22Treatment-naïveT3N1bM0 (III B)T3N1bM1c (IV C)1 LN + Peritoneal metastasisSurgeryUpstage23Treatment-naïveT3N1bM0 (III B)T3N1bM0 (III B)1 LNSurgeryNone24Post-operationM1M0No metastatic recurrence in anastomotic stomaEndoscopic biopsyDownstage26Treatment-naïveT3N1bM0 (III B)T3N1bM0 (III B)1 LNShrinkage after treatment (contrast CT)None27Treatment-naïveT3N0M0 (II A)T3N1aM0 (III B)1 LNSurgeryUpstage28Treatment-naïveT3N1cM0 (III B)T3N1cM1a (IV A)1 LN + Left acetabulum metastasisStaging surgery and shrinkage after treatment (contrast CT)Upstage30Neoadjuvant treatmentyT3N1aM0 (III B)yT3N1bM0 (III B)1 LNShrinkage after treatment (contrast CT)None33Treatment-naïveT4bN2bM0 (III C)T4bN2bM0 (III C)2 LNsShrinkage after treatment (contrast CT)None35Treatment-naïveT4aN1aM0 (III B)T4aN2bM0 (III C)7 LNsShrinkage after treatment (contrast CT)Upstage36Treatment-naïveT4aN2aM0 (III C)T4aN2aM1a (IV A)2 LNs + Liver metastasisContrast-enhanced MRIUpstage37Post-operationM1cM1cNo 2 right axillary and internal mammary LN metastasesNo change in size (follow-up by CT)None38Treatment-naïveT4aN1aM0 (III B)T4aN1bM0 (III B)1 LNSurgeryNone40Post-operationM1cM1cNo 1 right hilar LN metastasisNo change in size (follow-up by CT)None41Post-operationM1bM0No 7 mediastinal and hilar LN metastasesNo change in size (follow-up by CT)Downstage44Post-operationM1cM1c1 left hilar LN metastasisShrinkage after treatment (contrast CT)None46Post-operationM1cM1cNo metastatic recurrence in anastomotic stomaEndoscopic biopsyNone47Post-operationM1bM1cPeritoneal metastasesExpansion after drug resistanceUpstage49Post-operationM0M1aLeft 11th rib metastasisChanges in bone density (contrast CT)Upstage50Post-operationM1aM1cPeritoneal metastases (liver capsule)Contrast-enhanced MRIUpstage52Post-operationM1cM1c> 7 peritoneal metastasesShrinkage after treatment (contrast CT)None53Neoadjuvant treatmentyT3N0M0 (II A)yT3N1bM1b (IV B)9 LNsShrinkage after treatment (contrast CT)Upstage55Treatment-naïveT3N0M1a (IV A)T3N0M0 (II A)No 1 left hilar LN metastasisNo change in size (follow-up by CT)Downstage58Neoadjuvant treatmentyT1/2N0M1b (IV B)yT1/2N0M1a (IV A)No 4 cervical LN metastasesNo change in size (follow-up by CT)None59Post-operationM1cM1cNo metastatic recurrence in anastomotic stomaEndoscopic biopsyNone\n\nAmong all participants who were upstaged based on [68Ga]Ga-FAPI-04 PET/CT findings (10/61, 16.4%), the changes were based on the detection of new or additional distant metastases in one or more organ systems. All additional findings were confirmed through biopsy or surgery (10/34, 29.4%) or through other conventional imaging modalities (24/34, 70.6%). Moreover, in 16 participants, new lymph node metastases were detected but did not lead to changes in the stage ( ). The median uptake of [68Ga]Ga-FAPI-04 was higher than that of [18F]F-FDG in both abdominal (6.4 vs. 4.2, P < 0.001) and pelvic lymph nodes (4.6 vs. 2.7, P < 0.001; , ). The TBRs of both abdominal (3.5 vs. 2.1, P < 0.001) and pelvic lymph nodes (2.9 vs. 1.2, P < 0.001) were also significantly higher in [68Ga]Ga-FAPI-04 PET/CT images than in [18F]F-FDG PET/CT images. However, the median uptake (3.0 vs. 4.7, P < 0.001) and TBR (1.4 vs. 2.4, P < 0.001) of [68Ga]Ga-FAPI-04 were lower than those of [18F]F-FDG in thoracic lymph nodes ( ).\n\nTable 3\n\nTumour sites and parameters[18F]F-FDG PET/CT[68Ga]Ga-FAPI-04 PET/CT P-valuePrimary tumour No. of lesions (participants)37 (36)37 (36) Mean SUVmax (95% CI)11.4 (9.1, 13.8)9.7 (8.0, 11.4)0.09 Mean TBR (95% CI)8.2 (6.4, 10.6)13.3 (10.5, 16.2)<0.001Involved lymph nodes Cervical–supraclavicular No. of lesions (participants)6 (2)4 (2) Median SUVmax (range)3.2 (2.1–4.3)2 (1.8–2.5)0.027 Median TBR (range)1.6 (1.3–2.3)1.2 (1.1–1.5)0.027 Thoracic * No. of lesions (participants)26 (13)18 (13) Median SUVmax (range)4.7 (2.4–10.2)3.0 (1.9–12.9)<0.001 Median TBR (range)2.4 (1.0–4.9)1.4 (1.0–5.4)<0.001 Abdominal † No. of lesions (participants)26 (9)38 (9) Median SUVmax (range)4.2 (2.1–9.4)6.4 (2.7–20.5)<0.001 Median TBR (range)2.1 (1.2–6.3)3.5 (1.5–13.7)<0.001 Pelvic § No. of lesions (participants)37 (15)72 (15) Median SUVmax (range)2.7 (2.0–6.6)4.6 (2.5–17.6)<0.001 Median TBR (range)1.2 (0.7–3.3)2.9 (1.5–9.8)<0.001Involved distant lesions Liver No. of lesions (participants)16 (9)30 (9) Median SUVmax (range)4.6 (2.5–9.9)3.9 (1.7–12.2)0.951 Median TBR (range)1.9 (0.6–4.7)3.7 (1.6–7.6)<0.001 Lung No. of lesions (participants)24 (9)23 (9) Median SUVmax (range)2.1 (0.9–11.0)2.1 (1.0–11.2)0.484 Median TBR (range)4.1 (1.3–22.0)3.5 (1.2–22.4)0.017 Bone No. of lesions (participants)6 (5)8 (5) Median SUVmax (range)5.5 (4.0–8.8)7.9 (2.8–14.0)0.036 Median TBR (range)3.4 (2.9–5.0)8.7 (3.1–10.9)0.017 Peritoneum No. of lesions (participants)45 (20)60 (20) Median SUVmax (range)3.8 (1.1–16.4)5.2 (2.1–12.6)<0.001 Median TBR (range)3.8 (1.8–29.0)6.9 (2.6–31.5)<0.001 Brain No. of lesions (participants)1 (1)1 (1) Median SUVmax (range)6.9 (6.9)2.1 (2.1)NA Median TBR (range)0.9 (0.9)21 (21)NA\n\nImaging with [68Ga]Ga-FAPI-04 PET/CT led to upstaging based on the detection of peritoneal and bone metastases in four and two participants, respectively ( ). In all 20 participants, the SUVmax (5.2 vs. 3.8, P < 0.001) and TBR (6.9 vs. 3.8, P < 0.001) of [68Ga]Ga-FAPI-04 were higher than those of [18F]F-FDG in peritoneal metastases ( ). Compared with the [18F]F-FDG PET/CT images, the peritoneal metastases were clearly visible in the [68Ga]Ga-FAPI-04 PET/CT images ( , ). There was no significant difference in SUVmax between [68Ga]Ga-FAPI-04 and [18F]F-FDG in positive lung lesions (P = 0.484), but the TBR of [68Ga]Ga-FAPI-04 was significantly lower than that of [18F]F-FDG (P = 0.017; ).\n\nAlthough there was no significant difference in the SUVmax of [68Ga]Ga-FAPI-04 and [18F]F-FDG in positive liver lesions (3.9 vs. 4.6, P = 0.951), the number of positive liver lesions detected using [68Ga]Ga-FAPI-04 PET/CT was higher than that detected by [18F]F-FDG PET/CT because of the lower background SUVmax of [68Ga]Ga-FAPI-04. Further, 30 positive liver lesions detected using [68Ga]Ga-FAPI-04 PET/CT were confirmed as metastases through surgery/biopsy and other imaging modalities. Only 16 of these positive liver lesions were detected by [18F]F-FDG PET/CT (53.3%, 16/30). The TBR of [68Ga]Ga-FAPI-04 was significantly higher than that of [18F]F-FDG (3.7 vs. 1.9, P < 0.001), and the liver metastases were clearly visible in [68Ga]Ga-FAPI-04 PET/CT images and finally demonstrated using contrast-enhanced MRI ( ). presents the detailed comparison of liver metastases detected using [68Ga]Ga-FAPI-04 and [18F]F-FDG PET/CT.\n\nThe final staging changes in 15 participants were verified based on the reference standards; thus, 13 participants’ treatment options were changed from their pre-examination or originally planned regimens based on the changed stage. Chemo/radiotherapy and/or surgery was added in nine participants (#2, #22, #28, #35, #47, #49, #50, #53 and #55), and surgery was avoided or its scope was narrowed in the other participants (#5, #11, #24 and #41).\n\n4. Discussion\n\nFAP is an excellent target for tumour stroma, and 68Ga-FAPIs, as newer imaging tracers, present a promising alternative to [18F]F-FDG. This preliminary clinical study investigated the avidity of [68Ga]Ga-FAPI-04 in CRC and explored the potential utility of [68Ga]Ga-FAPI-04 PET/CT as the sole imaging modality for assessing primary and recurrent/metastatic CRC. Our analyses indicated that [68Ga]Ga-FAPI-04 PET/CT improved tumour staging in patients with CRC owing to favourable tumour/background activity and low tracer uptake in the gastrointestinal tract. Moreover, signet-ring/mucinous carcinomas accumulated more [68Ga]Ga-FAPI-04 than [18F]F-FDG, whereas FAPI avidity was lower than FDG avidity in poorly differentiated carcinomas.\n\nAs key constituents of the tumour stroma, CAFs can support the immunosuppressive microenvironment, tumour cell growth, progression and metastatic potential. Expressed by CAFs, FAP is an attractive diagnostic and therapeutic target (8, 10, 17). [68Ga]Ga-FAPI-04 PET/CT is characterised by high tumour/background activity and is more sensitive than [18F]F-FDG PET/CT for identifying primary gastrointestinal carcinoma lesions (12, 13).\n\nThe origin, number and distribution of FAP-expressing CAFs and the number of FAP molecules per cell may differ among tumours. Mona et al. (18) reported a strong correlation between tumour [68Ga]Ga-FAPI-46 uptake intensity and histopathological FAP expression in colon cancer. We expected variations in intra-tumoural tracer distribution in treatment-naïve patients with specific histopathologic types of CRC. In this study, we demonstrated additional FAP expression in signet-ring/mucinous carcinomas, which normally exhibit low [18F]F-FDG uptake (6, 7, 19). The results revealed that [68Ga]Ga-FAPI-04 PET/CT would have a lower false-negative rate than [18F]F-FDG PET/CT in detecting primary and metastatic CRC lesions. Although Solano-Iturri et al. (20) reported that CRC tissues with poor differentiation exhibited a higher percentage of FAP staining than those with moderately-well differentiation, the poorly differentiated carcinomas exhibited moderately higher [68Ga]Ga-FAPI-04 uptake without significant differences between these subtypes in our study. Moreover, we found that poorly differentiated carcinomas exhibited significantly lower [68Ga]Ga-FAPI-04 uptake than [18F]F-FDG uptake, although this subtype showed avidity for both [68Ga]Ga-FAPI-04 and [18F]F-FDG.\n\nThe TNM classification provides standard guidelines to classify the extent of cancer metastasis. The degree of tumour progression and invasion at the time of surgical resection as well as patient outcomes are estimated on the basis of this staging system for CRC. This study demonstrated that [68Ga]Ga-FAPI-04 PET/CT could detect both primary tumours and metastases arising from CRC. The sensitivity was 100% for both [68Ga]Ga-FAPI-04 and [18F]F-FDG PET/CT, and no significant differences in SUVmax were found between [68Ga]Ga-FAPI-04 and [18F]F-FDG PET/CT images in both treatment-naïve and post-treatment lesions. However, the average TBR of treatment-naïve lesions was significantly higher on [68Ga]Ga-FAPI-04 PET/CT than on [18F]F-FDG PET/CT. This result was consistent with the recently study reported by Halil et al. (21). Thus, [68Ga]Ga-FAPI-04 PET/CT might be more advantageous than [18F]F-FDG PET/CT to improve detecting efficiency in T stage.\n\nThe superiority of [18F]F-FDG PET/CT is evident in the detection of lymph node and distant metastases in CRC, and the detection of additional metastases can significantly change treatment plans (22, 23). However, several studies demonstrated that the detection of metastatic regional nodes was low/moderate using [18F]F-FDG PET/CT, illustrating the limitations of this method (24, 25). Several studies suggested that CRC commonly harbours CAF-expressing FAP. Sugai et al. (26) suggested that high FAP expression is correlated with lymph node metastasis in submucosal invasive CRC. Solano-Iturri et al. (20) observed a significant positive correlation between FAP expression in primary CRC tumours and their corresponding local and distant metastases. Thus, this study examined the reliability of [68Ga]Ga-FAPI-04 PET/CT for detecting metastatic CRC lesions. Our results showed that [68Ga]Ga-FAPI-04 PET/CT identified additional findings in 41 metastatic and 15 inflammatory lymph nodes of 24 participants with CRC and improved the N staging in these participants. Additionally, [68Ga]Ga-FAPI-04 uptake was higher than [18F]F-FDG uptake in abdominal and pelvic lymph nodes. However, cervical–supraclavicular and thoracic FDG-avid inflammatory/age-related lymph nodes were FAPI-negative.\n\nAccording to the M stage, the early detection of isolated metastases in the liver or other sites often improves survival following radical resection (27). Owing to moderate FDG uptake in the liver, [18F]F-FDG PET/CT was not the first choice for identifying liver metastasis. Our data revealed that the hepatic background intensity was significantly lower in [68Ga]Ga-FAPI-04 PET/CT than that in [18F]F-FDG PET/CT, corroborating the findings of previous studies (9, 11, 21). The TBR values of liver metastases were higher in [68Ga]Ga-FAPI-04 than those in [18F]F-FDG PET/CT in this study. Thus, FAPI-imaging might be advantageous for patients with suspected liver metastases, resulting in a potentially high detection rate. In this study, the smallest lesion detected had a diameter of approximately 0.7 cm. However, Halil et al. (21) found that both the SUVmax and TBR values of liver metastases were signifcantly higher in [18F]F-FDG than those in [68Ga]Ga-FAPI-04 PET/CT. We believe that this issue can be clarified with future studies involving larger and homogeneous cohorts. Reportedly, the peritoneum is another common site of CRC metastasis (28), and the degree of peritoneal metastasis determines the choice of treatment (23, 29). The detection rate of peritoneal metastasis using [18F]F-FDG PET/CT is not high, primarily because of intestinal inflammatory uptake, small lesions and other factors, including rare pathological types. [68Ga]Ga-FAPI-04 is an active fibroblast-targeted imaging agent, and the development of peritoneal metastases is primarily because of active fibroblasts (28), which is supported by the significantly higher [68Ga]Ga-FAPI-04 uptake in peritoneal metastatic lesions compared with [18F]F-FDG uptake observed in this study. This result was also consistent with the previous studies (13, 21).\n\nIn addition, we found that [68Ga]Ga-FAPI-04 uptake was significantly higher than [18F]F-FDG uptake in the uterus, which may be attributed to the presence of active fibroblasts in the uterus (30); this suggests that the SUVmax of lesions (primary or/and metastatic lesions) located in the pelvic area is affected by high [68Ga]Ga-FAPI-04 uptake, a potential limitation of [68Ga]Ga-FAPI-04 PET/CT imaging.\n\nThis study has several limitations. First, the cohort size was small, and the number of participants with brain and bone metastases was low. Second, the cohort was heterogeneous and included participants with different treatment statuses, which could have affected the SUVmax values of lesions. Third, the period of follow-up was set to 3–6 months based on previous experience. Although most of lesions could be observed obvious changes indicating their benign or malignant features, a few lesions might be taken longer to be followed up. Lastly, we could not pathologically confirm all suspicious lesions without considering ethics; thus, neither accurate sensitivity nor specificity could be established. Future studies with larger and homogeneous cohorts are warranted to provide a more comprehensive analysis of the utility of [68Ga]Ga-FAPI-04 PET/CT in CRC."
