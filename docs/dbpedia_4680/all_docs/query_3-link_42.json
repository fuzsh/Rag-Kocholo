        "text": "A fund has been established to help the children orphaned by Bradley Stone's alleged killing spree this week in Montgomery County, as well as Anthony Flick, the 17-year-old who is the lone survivor of the rampage.\n\nSouderton-Telford Rotary and Word FM, a faith-based radio station heard in the Lehigh Valley at 90.3 FM, partnered with the nonprofit Univest Foundation to establish the \"Stone & Flick Children Fund\" to assist in raising money for the daughters of Bradley and Nicole Stone and for Flick.\n\nBradley Stone on Monday morning allegedly killed Nicole Stone, his ex-wife; her sister, Patricia Flick, and brother-in-law, Aaron Flick, and their 14-year-old daughter, Nina Flick; her mother, Joanne Hill, and grandmother Patricia Hill. Bradley Stone was found dead Tuesday afternoon with self-inflicted cutting wounds near his home in Pennsburg, Montgomery County.\n\nThe adults were shot, The Associated Press reported; the teens were slashed and suffered blows to their head.\n\nMontgomery County Coroner Walter Hofman on Wednesday said Bradley Stone's cause of death couldn't immediately be determined. He says it may be known after a toxicology test, which he expects back early next week.\n\nMontgomery County District Attorney Risa Vetri Ferman had said Tuesday the suspect apparently had died of self-inflicted cutting wounds. Hofman said Stone had only a limited injury to his left leg that had nothing to do with his death.\n\nAnthony Flick suffered a gaping skull fracture but survived the attack on his family and was flown in serious condition for treatment in Philadelphia, authorities said. He is the subject of a fund campaign independent of the Rotary and Word FM-led effort.\n\n.\n\nMelissa Mecca, organizer of the gofundme.com campaign, said Wednesday afternoon on the site he was \"in stable condition and is going to be OK.\"\n\n\"In one day Anthony's entire family was killed,\" the campaign states. \"Anthony is currently in the hospital and will need a lot of help dealing with the deaths and the expenses of this tragedy.\"\n\nDave Baker, station manager of Word FM, said Wednesday in a statement: \"We know that we can never put back together the pieces that these children have lost, but our hope is that as the generosity of our community members comes forth, we'll be able to provide a little peace and comfort.\"\n\nThat drive began with $3,000 from Univest, $1,000 each from Word FM and the Souderton-Telford Rotary.\n\n\"Our community has been hit hard by this unthinkable tragedy,\" Souderton police Chief Jim Leary, who is president of the Rotary Club, said in a statement. \"We are responding as our community always does: united to show our support for the children who need to know we stand beside them and are here to help them move forward.\"\n\nDonations to the effort can be made:\n\nOnline at\n\nVia checks payable to Univest Foundation and designated \"Stone & Flick Children Fund\" in the memo line, mailed to to Univest Foundation, 14 N. Main St., P.O. Box 559, Souderton, PA 18964. Donors who want to direct funds to one of the children can do so by including the name in the check memo line. Authorities have not released the Stone girls' names or ages.\n\nThe Associated Press contributed to this report."
