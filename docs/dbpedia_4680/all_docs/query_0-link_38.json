        "text": "By Colombo Telegraph –\n\n“After the meeting, according to Daniels, the Director of Information asked him if he would like a private moment with the president to congratulate him on the victory. Daniels then met the president, who was standing with two other assistants. Rajapaksa, in a harsh tone, told Daniels that he knew that MTV was against him and that they would face consequences. The two assistants cited a number of “violations” to illustrate his point.” the US Embassy Colombo informed Washington.\n\nA Leaked “CONFIDENTIAL” US diplomatic cable, dated February 2, 2010, updated the Secretary of State on Sri Lanka’s media suppression situation shows the way President Mahinda Rajapaksa harassed opposition media outlets. The Colombo Telegraph found the related leaked cable from the WikiLeaks database. The cable was written by the Ambassador Patricia A. Butenis.\n\nUnder the subheading “MTV WARNED NOT TO CRITICIZE GOVERNMENT” ambassador Butenis wrote “Since the presidential election on January 26, the Government of Sri Lanka (GSL) has intensified actions against media outlets that it perceived gave the government unfavorable coverage during the campaign. Sirisa Media Network (MTV), the largest private electronic media (television and radio) in the country, has been under increased GSL pressure. On January 28, Channel Director (CEO equivalent) Chevaan Daniels told PAO that he had received a call that morning from the Director of Information, telling Daniels that MTV should pay attention not to air stories critical of the government for at least one month. Later that day, Daniels and other media executives were summoned to Temple Trees, the official residence of the president, for a meeting with the newly reelected Rajapaksa. At the meeting, the president told media executives that he knew that some people in the room were for him during the campaign and some were critical. Rather than adopt a conciliatory tone, Daniels said the president warned the executives that action would be taken against media outlets that tried to disrupt racial harmony or support terrorism — code words for disloyalty to the Rajapaksa regime.”\n\nUnder the subheading “GOVERNMENT THREATENS TO PULL MTV LICENSE” Butenis wrote “On January 30, MTV received a letter from W. B. Ganegala, Secretary in the Ministry of Mass Media and Information. The letter opened: ‘It has been observed that your Radio and Television Networks have been broadcasting news and other programs at times in a provocative and inciting manner which will have a serious impact on the normal public and social order.’ The letter claimed that MTV ‘gave undue publicity to false statements made by a defeated Presidential Candidate and some other persons who supported him.’ The letter closed by urging MTV to be more ‘responsible whenever you broadcast sensitive information which has direct impact on Children’s Rights, National Security, Sri Lankan Identity, Communal Harmony and (the) Good image of the country at large… Unless you adopt a more responsible approach toward your broadcasts, we will be compelled to take appropriate action in terms of the provisions of the Sri Lanka Broadcasting Corporation Act No. 37 of 1967, the Sri Lanka Rupavahini Corporation Act No. 6 of 1982 and other relevant laws of the country.’ Other language in the letter implied that the company’s broadcasting license was at risk of cancellation.”\n\n“PAO met with Daniels on February 1 to discuss the letter. Daniels said MTV would not stand down, despite the letter, and would continue to broadcast news it deemed relevant for Sri Lankans to know. Daniels said MTV would respond with a letter that would outline 22 instances during the campaign when MTV gave essentially free air time to the president, along with notes of praise received from GSL officials on MTV’s election coverage. Further, MTV would advocate that the 4.5 million Sri Lankans who voted for General Fonseka had a right to know what their candidate was now saying. If the tables were turned and the president had lost, MTV would also cover Rajapaksa’s statements. Daniels also outlined a number of threats against him and other employees. Daniels said that on January 30, he received a call from a man speaking in Sinhala who said that he and his family would be burned with acid (a relatively common attack technique in Sri Lanka). Daniels is changing homes and modes of transportation on a near-daily basis.” Butenis further wrote.\n\nThe cable also discussed the harassments against other media outlets, Lanka E News, Siyatha, Lanka news paper and the Sunday Leader.\n\nPlacing a comment the ambassador wrote “This renewed encroachment on media freedom is another example of the government’s clampdown on opposition voices and assertion of control over the message. The Ambassador continues to engage high-level GSL officials, including most recently Foreign Minister Bogollagama (reftel) and Minister of Justice Malinda Moragoda, raising concerns about media freedom and the treatment of Fonseka. Other Post officers also are engaged with the issues and remain in close contact with opposition figures and embattled journalists. Other missions are actively engaged as well, and we understand the EU heads of mission will be meeting FM Bogollagama Thursday to deliver a message similar to the Ambassador’s in the context of the GSP-plus trade preference.”\n\nRelated Posts ;\n\nWikiLeaks:Rajapaksa Managed To Influenced MTV Owner Maharaja\n\nRead the cable below for further details;\n\nVZCZCXRO4172 OO RUEHAG RUEHROV RUEHSL RUEHSR DE RUEHLM #0082/01 0331337 ZNY CCCCC ZZH O 021337Z FEB 10 FM AMEMBASSY COLOMBO TO RUEHC/SECSTATE WASHDC IMMEDIATE 1242 INFO RUCNMEM/EU MEMBER STATES COLLECTIVE PRIORITY RUEHKA/AMEMBASSY DHAKA PRIORITY 2369 RUEHIL/AMEMBASSY ISLAMABAD PRIORITY 9391 RUEHKT/AMEMBASSY KATHMANDU PRIORITY 7646 RUEHLO/AMEMBASSY LONDON PRIORITY 5424 RUEHNE/AMEMBASSY NEW DELHI PRIORITY 3806 RUEHNY/AMEMBASSY OSLO PRIORITY 0010 RUEHOT/AMEMBASSY OTTAWA PRIORITY 0210 RUEHMD/AMEMBASSY MADRID PRIORITY 0164 RUEHKO/AMEMBASSY TOKYO PRIORITY 4473 RUEHCG/AMCONSUL CHENNAI PRIORITY 9952 RUEHBI/AMCONSUL MUMBAI PRIORITY 7199 RUEHON/AMCONSUL TORONTO PRIORITY 0205 RHEFDIA/DIA WASHINGTON DC PRIORITY RUEHGV/USMISSION GENEVA PRIORITY 0092 RHHMUNA/HQ USPACOM HONOLULU HI PRIORITY RUEHBS/USEU BRUSSELS PRIORITY RHEHAAA/NATIONAL SECURITY COUNCIL WASHINGTON DC PRIORITY RUEKJCS/SECDEF WASHDC PRIORITY"
