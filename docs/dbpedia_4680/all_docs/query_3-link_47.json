        "text": "The 2022 Diversitech Summit presented by Tribaja took place March 16 to March 18 virtually\n\nand was capped off with an in person gala on March 18 at the W Philadelphia on level 7, the Wet Deck Bar, overlooking the city scape and pool.\n\nI love this colorful flower wall which will no doubt be used as a backdrop for years to come\n\nTribaja is a proud minority and woman owned business founded by Shannon Morales in 2017. Shannon Morales started the company after experiencing unconscious bias in the workplace and set out to create a platform vetted with only the best work environments for underrepresented talent. Shannon Morales is a single mother, Afro Latina, and social entrepreneur. She was awarded “Culture Builder of the Year” in Philly tech, nominated for Young professional of the year, and is a first generation graduate.\n\nVernon recently launched a Street Photography program called “Shoot Cameras, Not Guns”\n\nVernon Ray had an epiphany after attending his younger cousin’s funeral. Seeing a young man lose his life, not much older than Ray’s son, it was time to give back to the community.\n\nRay launched Shoot Cameras, Not Guns, a program through his photography studio to teach children, teens, and even adults photography as an alternative to getting involved in street life.\n\n“I called my brother, and I say, ‘Yo man, we got to do something man,’” Ray said. “Just like that, I just blurted out ‘shoot cameras not guns.’” according to the Philadelphia Tribune.\n\nKharisma McIlwaine, a Philadelphia native, is a Multimedia personality, Writer, Community Ambassador, Singer and Film Maker and Kate Marlys of Philly PR Girl . The cocktail reception was the perfect gathering to celebrate the success of the 2022 Diversitech Summit, and kick off in person events. The W Hotel’s Wet Deck is Philly’s hottest new event space. Spacious, beautiful, indoor outdoor flexibility.\n\nLast week Rebecca Segall, Owner and Director of Gross McCleaf Gallery (127 S 16th St) hosted a cocktail party celebrating the collaboration of artist Thomas Paul Raggio and CMMP. Thomas Paul Raggio’s solo exhibit will be on display featuring CMMP garments highlighting the lining collab.\n\nSeasonally, CMMP partners with a US-based contemporary artist to design exclusive linings for our blazers and suits. For SS22 we decided to partner with Thomas Paul Raggio, a philly-based contemporary artist and fine art lecturer. His use of color and clean geometric images are the perfect contrast to our suiting. (note the lining of the coat which matches Raggio’s painting above the jacket.)\n\nThomas Paul Raggio: In The Valley\n\n“I contemplate every color, mark, and placement of the line to formulate what I call rhythmic velocities: relationships of color and motion that give life to the composition, creating a heartbeat. I am interested in the duality of math and design: through repetition, a line made of color becomes a rhythmic pattern. This concept is found when composing music, organic landscapes and architectural structures. By referencing these sources, my abstractions transcend their formal components, reaching beyond a minimalist canon.” – Thomas Paul Raggio\n\nGross McCleaf Gallery has been an esteemed fixture on Philly’s gallery scene for more than 50 years, but with the recent retirement of longtime owner Sharon Ewing and the new ownership under PAFA graduate Rebecca Segall, the contemporary gallery is prepared to take on the next half-century with a refreshed—and decidedly modernday— perspective * source. Look for more exciting exhibition openings, and receptions.\n\nAccording to Variety…. Philadelphia born Lee Daniels will direct “Demon House,” based on the story of an Indiana family (Ammons) that has claimed to be a victim of demonic possession. Several Hollywood players, including MGM and Miramax, were vying for rights to the Oscar-nominated director’s upcoming project. Netflix’s $65 million price tag — a hefty sum covering the film’s production budget and buyouts — secured the sale, according to Deadline Hollywood, who broke the news of Netfliks purchase.\n\nI had mentioned in December Lee Daniels would be filming Demon House in our area after attending a Phildanco event where Daniels was to be honored, but wasn’t able to make it. At that event Sharon Pinkenson announced he’d be back in our area to do this film. Thanks to the GPFO and all the work they do to secure these projects.\n\nDemon House reunites Daniels and Andra Day, who recently worked together on Hulu’s musical biographical drama “The United States vs. Billie Holiday.” Rounding out the cast includes Glenn Close, Octavia Spencer, Rob Morgan, “Stranger Things” actor Caleb McLaughlin (who filmed Concrete Cowboy in 2019) and “King Richard” breakout Aunjanue Ellis.\n\nHere’s my scoop: Look for Demon House to begin filming in our area at the end of April and continue until June. It’ll be filmed in Philadelphia, Sun Studios and my sources tell me in New Jersey.\n\nThe Philly Home Show March 18th through 20th and 25th through 27th at the Pennsylvania Convention Center. Discover. Plan. Do. Two weekends only for great deals, new ideas, and practical advice, with trusted, local experts that can make your dream home a reality;\n\nBugsy Drake of “The Queen of Theme” is widely known for her role as Chief Stew on Bravo’s Below Deck Mediterranean, Christine “Bugsy” Drake, can be seen dazzling luxury yacht guests with her signature tablescapes and over-the-top theme parties.\n\nBugsy will be appearing in the Affinity Furniture booth (#824) Saturday, March 26 from 12noon-1pm.

Hope to see you tomorrow at Love Park for the Power99, Love & Grit Wedding Pop up between 10am and noon. Three couples are getting married.\n\nCongrats Brianna Dugan and Pat Schultz who I caught getting engaged yesterday at Elfreth’s Alley. I was there with a Meetup photo group I belong to. If you want to meet new people, or hang with people with your same interests, there is a Meet Up group in our area for you. Brianna and Pat met on Hinge, so if you’re looking for someone to date that sounds like a good way as well.\n\n‘Servant’ created by Tony Basgallop and executive-produced by The Sixth Sense writer-director M. Night Shyamalan started filming Season 4 this week. Has been the case in past seasons they started production in the neighborhood where it’s set, Fitler/Rittenhouse Sq., before it heads into Night’s replica neighborhood in a studio in Delco.\n\nThe Apple TV+ thriller Servant returned for its third season on Friday, Jan. 21, with actors Lauren Ambrose, Toby Kebbell, #NellTigerFree, and #RupertGrint coming back for the next chapter of the psychological drama. Watch it!! Then next year the final season of Servant will run. The episodes\n\nI photographed the action on Tuesday and Friday this week. Soooo cold Tuesday, spring like on Friday. But the episodes filmed were in the “fall” season. Note pumpkins and leaves.\n\nLittle Susie’s has opened at 2nd and Chestnut Streets this weekend. Can’t wait to try some of their pies people rave about. Mushroom & Swiss Pie, Glazed Cherry Pie, Apple Pie, Pork Roll & Cheese Pie. Lot’s happening in Old City lately. Last month I wrote about Riversward Produce opening on Bread Street soon. Last week Frame restaurant opened. I’ll have photos from that event this week.\n\nThanks to Steven Singer and Slice Pizza Philly for treating the front line workers at Pennsylvania Hospital this past weekend with 350 heart shaped pizzas.\n\nTwo local small businesses are teaming up with the most unique Valentine’s Day gifts in the region. Steven Singer Jewelers returns for Valentine’s with their signature 24 kt. gold-dipped roses, including a new color with Emerald City Green. Singer is open at their location at 739 Walnut with special Valentine’s Weekend hours. SliCE is also taking orders and delivering heart-shaped pizza grams now through Valentine’s Day in Fishtown, Northern Liberties, Center City, South Philly, University City and Washington Township. Together, the two have joined forces and Singer is donating part of the proceeds from Valentine’s gold-dipped rose sales to support SliCE and feed over 750 health heroes and frontline staff heart-shaped pizzas this week at both Thomas Jefferson University Hospital and Pennsylvania Hospital. On Valentine’s Day itself the two will again team up and three lucky heart gram recipients will find a special gold-dipped rose with their heart-shaped pizza.\n\nSteven Singer Jewelers, at 8th and Walnut Street, for in-person shopping as well as their fast and free shipping year-round. Singer’s most popular and well-known item across the city, region and country is their 24 karat gold and platinum dipped roses – Singer’s best selling and most popular products. Singer specifically selected this item to help give back as it is a signature seller that everyone has come to associate him and his company with. The roses are also a very relatable symbol we can all rally around and come together as a community. For many families, there are generations of family members who have been collecting the roses and who are passing them down to their children and grandchildren. Each rose is a one-of-a-kind and comes with a lifetime guarantee. They come in a variety of exclusive colors starting at just $59.\n\nSteven Singer Jewelers is donating a portion of proceeds from Valentine’s sales of his famous 24 karat gold and platinum dipped roses to thank frontline essential hospital workers and first responders – and at the same time support local, independent restaurants during a crisis for their industry. Valentines leading to Mother’s Day is one of Singers’ biggest times of year for the gold-dipped roses – and he wanted to again thank them as they continue to battle COVID 19. This is a win-win to help hospital employees and a way to help SliCE as they work hard to stay in business during the pandemic.\n\nThe joint was jumping this past week as Craftsman Row Saloon, at 112 S. 8th Street, debuted their Mardi Gras theme bar/eatery on Thursday. It had all the feels of a great New Orleans party. As with their pop up Christmas themed bar, decorations got you in the mood for some delicious southern delights.\n\nCraftsman Row Saloon is owned by brother-and-sister restaurateurs George and Vasiliki Tsiouris, co-owners of Midtown Village’s popular Drury Beer Garden that currently features their beloved Greek cuisine with the Opa Pop-Up.\n\nGuests enjoyed Dirty Rice with Shrimp, Ground Beef, Peppers and Onions, which was delicious. Diners were delighted with King Cake Sweet Potato Fries, which really tasted like pancakes at dinner. Sweet was an understatement. Regular menu items are also available like the Dorito coated mozzarella sticks, award-winning burgers, and fiery buffalo mac-n-cheese.\n\nCraftsman’s Row Over-theTop Theme Milkshakes were transformed for the season: King of Bourbon Street – Bassetts vanilla ice cream, king cake, white chocolate, cinnamon, powdered donut, caramel drizzle, beads, festive sprinkles (boozy option also available) Bourbon Street Inspired Cocktails Cereal Milk Punch – bourbon, cereal-milk, nutmeg Masquerade Hurricane – light and dark rum, orange, pineapple, lemon Smudge Kit Margarita – tequila, sage, triple sec, lime\n\nMichael Newmuis, Chief of Staff at Visit Philadelphia at Craftsman Row Saloon. Of course I tried to get him to move his head ever so slightly to the left without him knowing… hehehe\n\nIt was an enjoyable night trying all the new dishes and shakes.\n\nNBC10 co workers Sheila Watko and Lucy Bustamante celebrate the evening, and were still sporting smiles hours later despite Lucy’s car being towed and the dynamic duo had to bail her out of the PPA impoundment. I want these two at my next party. They knew the assignment.\n\nAlso in on the assignment sisters Alyse Scaffidi and Lexi Scaffidi with Alyse ‘s husband 𝐊𝐲𝐥𝐞 𝐂𝐚𝐫𝐛𝐞𝐫𝐫𝐲 (c)\n\nIf it wasn’t exciting enough that Main Line Today and Today Media announced the 2022 Main Line Today Restaurant Week running February 21st through March 6th, 2022.

Winter got real these past few weeks. It was cold, it snowed, but life continues with caution and optimism . One of futures hope is the beautiful, life changing Jefferson Specialty Care Pavilion which held it’s Topping Off Ceremony earlier this week.\n\nThomas Jefferson University and Jefferson Health topped off a $762 million, 19-floor Specialty Care Pavilion at 11th and Chestnut streets that will eventually become the centerpiece of its Philadelphia campus.

Read more about the Specialty Care Pavilion at Metro Philly, and Phila Biz Journal.\n\nJustin Beiber was spotted in Lancaster County Wednesday according Lancaster Online to (PS I had heard the Beibs was rehearsing at Rock Lititz last week, but was sitting on the story until I wrote about my own visit to Lancaster which I will do on Monday.) He’s at the famed sound stages of Rock Lititz staging his upcoming concert tour, Bieber’s world tour, called “The Justice World Tour 2022” which starts later this month. If you recall right before the pandemic started, he was spotted in Philly at the Rocky Steps, and the Four Seasons, which I wrote about. After his tour was scrapped I mentioned he was headed to Rock Lititz to rehearse his tour then as well. Since then I have visited Lititz to check out the place. It’s very cool, a very large campus of warehouses in which several musicians have come to rehearse their shows before heading out on tour including Katy Perry, Mumford & Sons, Green Day and Ariana Grande to name a few. Next up for Lititz is the Fire and Ice Festival in a few weeks. I wonder if Beiber will stop by. Here’s the INFO\n\nPennsylvania’s Commonwealth Court welcomed its newest judge as Lori Dumas was sworn in Wednesday during a ceremonial session led by state Supreme Court Justice Kevin M. Dougherty at the National Constitution Center in Philadelphia.\n\nThe setting at the Constitution Center was perfect, in the shadow of Independence Hall. The tributes paid to Judge Dumas were moving, and her comments about others who went before her and planted the seeds was monumental (like the first black women elected, Doris A Smith -Ribner Retired of the Commonwealth Court of Pennsylvania for the United States Supreme Court.) Thank you to those who went before us. More photos and stories at CBSPhilly, and Phila Tribune.\n\nBon voyage Marilyn Russell.
