Presented by Women in Music.\n\nWomen are still far from achieving gender parity in the music industry. Increasing amounts of women are working and taking on leadership roles in the music industry, yet so few hold upper management positions and the final decision-making power to guide the industry’s future. Numerous studies have shown that businesses experience greater success when women are involved in the strategy development and decision making at the top levels of an industry. At this crucial time, amidst so much transition, it is not only imperative that a woman’s voice be heard but that she be in the position of power to make positive improvements. But how do we get there? How do increasing amounts of women in music gain confidence in their own power to be leaders and take on the challenge? What skills do women need to advance this cause? And, what can the industry do as a whole to accelerate gender parity?\n\nTo help reach this goal, NMS is hosting a Women in Music Meet-up on Monday June 22nd to provide a platform for open discussions on ways to motivate more women to be leaders, discuss solutions to reach gender parity in our industry and to raise awareness of the non-profit, Women in Music, and its mission.\n\nLike last year’s successful and well-attended Women in Music Open Forum, this meeting will be presented in a “town hall” fashion which will allow the audience to provide their thoughts, opinions, suggestions, and solutions for a brighter future for women in the music industry.\n\nAll women in music and those interested in supporting the mission should attend.\n\nPlayers: Neeta Ragoowansi (President, Women in Music), Ariell Hyatt (Founder, Cyber PR), Diana Akin (Sr. Coordinator, Writer/Publisher Relations, SESAC)\n\nIndependent Labels\n\nThe independent labels became organized 10 years ago with the founding of A2iM. A few years later, Merlin was founded. Independent labels control 35% of sales market share and probably more than that of streaming market share. As we enter Indie Week, we ask why independent labels continue to grow market share each year.? Why are independent labels responsible for the birth of every new genre and a disproportionate share of the most important artists in history? Why might independent labels may be a better choice for artists than majors?\n\nConductor: Portia Sabin (President, Kill Rock Stars Records)\n\nPlayers: Tony Brummel (Founder, Victory Records), Ed Vetri (CEO, Wind-Up Records), Andreas Katsambas (CEO, The End Records), Nick Catchdubs (Co-Founder, Fool’s Gold Records), Patricia Chin (Founder, VP Records)\n\n“The Situation” A Live Reality Show About the Music Business.\n\nA label, distributor, manager, marketing company are releasing a project.

User generated videos generate revenue the majority of all YouTube music revenue. Music sample use has driven the hip hop movement for 35 years and has generated hundreds of millions of dollars for artists and rights owners. More than 60% of YouTube music revenue comes from derivative works. New formats for stem-mixes are now being introduced that will further expand the world of derivative works. How can the music industry look at derivative works as a giant new revenue center by embracing this opportunity rather than ignoring it or rejecting it?\n\nConductor: Sophia Chang (SVP A&R Operations, Island Records)\n\nPlayers: Larry Mills (CEO, We Are The Hits), Ian Allen (VP Business Affairs Admin, Business & Legal, Universal Music Group), Mark Summers (CEO, Scorccio), Ronny Krieger (Head of Content, Native Instruments), Gil Aronow (EVP, Business & Legal Affairs, Commercial Music Group)\n\nLeveraging The Relationship: Artist and Brand Alignment\n\nWith the shifting paradigm of the music industry and how artists engage with fans, the importance of relationship management is more imperative than ever.
