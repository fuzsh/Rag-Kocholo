Kaytser, I. Hakkinen, P. Zhang\n\nRutgers Robert Wood Johnson Medical School, New Brunswick, NJ, United States\n\nCorrespondence: V. Kaytser; I. Hakkinen; P. Zhang\n\nBackground: This project aims to compare the likelihood of a theoretical drug-drug interaction between a number of abortives and preventives using DrugBank\"s application programing interface (API) versus the empirically reported interactions using the FDA\"s Adverse Event Reporting System (FAERS) API.\n\nMethods: We included, as input, abortive and preventive drugs from the AHS Position Statement on Integrating New Migraine Treatments into Clinical Practice, as well as Szperka\"s, Migraine Care in the Era of COVID-19. All combinations of up to 3 abortives and/or preventives are screened for interactions through DrugBank and FAERS. If at least one interaction, of any type, is listed, then it is included here and compared across the two databases.\n\nResults: We included 38 abortives and 23 preventives. We downloaded DrugBank data on August 26, 2020 and included FAERS data from October 2012 to March 2020. Table 1 contains the number of interactions for a given number of medications. Due to hardware limitations, 3 abortives vs. 3 preventives was not analyzed.\n\nConclusion: The likelihood of an interaction increases as the number of combinations of abortives and preventives increases. Per DrugBank, the chance of an interaction is >99% once more than 3 drugs are used in combination. Whereas, the reported interaction is actually less, 60%, per FAERS. This data may help providers to use more rational polypharmacy.\n\nAL02 An AI-enabled ECG Algorithm Predicts Higher Subclinical Atrial Fibrillation Risk in Patients with Migraine with Aura Compared to Migraine without Aura\n\nN. Chhabra1, C. J. Chao2, N. Zhang3, E. Lim3, H. Wang4, Z. Attia5, P. Friedman5, P. Noseworthy2, C. C. Chiang6\n\n1Mayo Clinic, Neurology, Scottsdale, AZ, United States; 2Mayo Clinic, Cardiology, Scottsdale, AZ, United States; 3Mayo Clinic, Quantitative Health Research, Scottsdale, AZ, United States; 4Mayo Clinic, Neurology, Mankato, MN, United States; 5Mayo Clinic, Cardiology, Rochester, MN, United States; 6Mayo Clinic, Neurology, Rochester, MN, United States\n\nCorrespondence: N. Chhabra\n\nObjective: Migraine with aura (MwA) is associated with a 2-fold risk of ischemic stroke. Higher incidence of atrial fibrillation (AF) has been demonstrated in MwA compared to Migraine without aura (MwoA) in longitudinal cohort studies. The Mayo Clinic Cardiology team developed an artificial intelligence-enabled ECG (AI-ECG) algorithm that predicts probability of AF in ECGs interpreted as normal sinus rhythm (NSR). We aim to assess the probability of AF predicted by the AI-ECG algorithm in patients with MwA and MwoA.\n\nMethods: Adult patients with a MwA or MwoA diagnosis and at least one NSR ECG within the past 5 years at Mayo Clinic were identified. Patients with AF and inconsistent diagnoses of migraine types were excluded. The AI-ECG data with the highest predicted AF probability was used to compare the MwA and MwoA groups.\n\nResults: The analysis included 676 MwA and 1124 MwoA patients. The MwA group was significantly older than MwoA (50.2 vs. 46.6, p <0.001). After adjusting for age and sex, MwA patients had a higher mean probability of AF compared to MwoA (7.6%±0.5% vs. 5.9%± 0.4% p =0.003). The difference of AF probability between MwA and MwoA was significant in men, but not in women.\n\nConclusions: The probability of AF predicted by an AI-enabled ECG algorithm is significantly higher in patients with MwA compared to MwoA. This supports that AF-mediated cardioembolism plays a significant role in the MwA-stroke association.\n\nAL03 Gene networks reveal functional distinct mechanisms segregating in families with clustering of migraine\n\nA. Rasmussen1, L. J. A. Kogelman1, D. M. Kristensen1, M. A. Chalmer1, J. Olesen1, T. F. Hansen1,2\n\n1Copehagen University Hospital, Danish Headache Center, Glostrup, Denmark; 2Copenhagen University, Novo Nordic Foundation Center for Protein Research, Copenhagen, Denmark\n\nCorrespondence: T. F. Hansen\n\nBackground: Migraine has complex polygenic origins with a heritability of estimated 40–70%. Both common and rare genetic variants are believed to underlie the pathophysiology of the prevalent types of migraine, migraine with typical aura and migraine without aura. However, only common variants have been identified so far.\n\nMethods: We utilize a systems genetics approach and integrate RNA sequencing data from brain and vascular tissues knwon to be involved in mgriane, and assessed whole genome sequencing of 117 families with clustering of migraine. We then use a whole genome sequenced cohort of clinical and urelated patients with migraine.\n\nResults: A gene module in the visual cortex, based on single nuclei RNA sequencing data, that had increased rare mutations in the migraine families and replicated this in a second independent cohort of 1930 patients. This module was mainly expressed by interneurons, pyramidal CA1, and pyramidal SS cells, and pathway analysis showed association with hormonal signalling (thyrotropin-releasing hormone and oxytocin receptor), Alzheimer\"s disease pathway, serotonin receptor pathway and general heterotrimeric G-protein signalling pathways.\n\nConlcusion: We demonstrate that rare functional gene variants are strongly implicated in the pathophysiology of migraine. Furthermore, we our results may explain some of the missing heritability and thus mechanisms behind migraine.\n\nAL04 Genome-wide analysis of 102,084 migraine cases identifies 123 risk loci and subtype-specific risk alleles\n\nH.

Hautakangas\n\nObjective: We set out to conduct the largest genome-wide analysis of migraine to date and further evaluated shared and distinct genetic components in the two main migraine subtypes: migraine with aura (MA) and migraine without aura (MO).\n\nMethods: Our analysis included 102,084 migraine cases and 771,257 controls. We used LDSC to evaluate whether the polygenic migraine signal was enriched near genes that were active in certain tissue or cell types.\n\nResults: We identified 123 risk loci of which 86 are novel. A stratification of the risk loci by subtypes indicated 3 risk variants that appear specific for MA (in HMOX2, CACNA1A and MPPED2), 2 that appear specific for MO (near SPINK2 and near FECH), and 9 that increase susceptibility for migraine regardless of subtype. The new risk loci include genes encoding recent migraine-specific drug targets, namely calcitonin gene-related peptide (CALCA/CALCB) and serotonin 1F receptor (HTR1F). We report enrichment of migraine signal in 5 central nervous system and 3 cardiovascular cell types, and in single cell types of digestive system, musculoskeletal/connective tissue and ovary at FDR 5%.\n\nConclusion: New risk loci include migraine-specific drug targets. We provided a concrete view to the homogeneity and heterogeneity in the genetic background of migraine subtypes. Genomic annotations among migraine-associated variants supported that neurovascular mechanisms underlie migraine pathophysiology.\n\nAL05 Dry eye disease in migraine: A case control study\n\nB. Chowdhury1, P. Dubey1, D. Chowdhury2\n\n1North DMC Medical College & Hindu Rao Hospital, Ophthalmology, Delhi, India; 2G B Pant Institute of Post graduate Medical Education and Research, NEUROLOGY, Delhi, India\n\nCorrespondence: B. Chowdhury\n\nObjective: To study the prevalence of dry eye disease (DED) in migraine patients and compare it with non-migraine controls.\n\nMethod: This was a cross-sectional, observational hospital-based study. Sixty preventive drug-naive migraineurs diagnosed by ICHD-3 and 60 controls (patients presenting for refractive error without any migraine), aged 18-65 years were studied. Patients with comorbidities that can cause DED were excluded. Tear film break-up time (TBUT), Fluorescein staining, Schirmer\"s-I test, and ocular surface disease index (OSDI) scores were generated. Severe DED was diagnosed using the ODISSEY algorithm. Only severely affected eye was used for comparison.\n\nResult: The migraineurs and the controls were age and sex-matched (33.5 ± 7.1; M: F=46:14 vs 33.8 ± 7.4; M: F=46:14). The mean TBUT (11.65±6.33 vs 14.30±4.67 seconds) and fluorescein scores (1.125±0.81 vs 0.692±0.63) were significantly worse in cases compared to controls (p=0.010). The prevalence of DED and severe DED was found to be higher in migraine patients (46.7% and 16.7%) as compared to controls (18.3% and 1.7%) (Table1). Among the migraineurs, only mean pain severity was significantly associated with the presence of DED (Table 2). Migraineurs with severe DED had both higher frequency and severity of headache attacks.\n\nConclusion: DED was more common in migraine patients compared to non-migraineurs. Severe DED in migraineurs was associated with increased frequency and severity of headache.\n\nAL06 Cortical morphological changes in cluster headache between bouts: voxel- and surface-based analyses\n\nL. Lai1,2, Y. T. Hsiao3, W. K. Chan3, S. J. Wang3,1,2\n\n1National Yang Ming Chiao Tung University, Neurology, Taipei City, Taiwan; 2National Yang Ming Chiao Tung University, Brain Research Center, Taipei City, Taiwan; 3Taipei Veterans General Hospital, Department of Neurology, Taipei City, Taiwan\n\nCorrespondence: L. Lai\n\nObjective: Previous structural imaging studies in cluster headache (CH) used either volume- (VBM) or surface-based morphometry (SBM) to evaluate related morphological changes. A study combining both methods may provide further insights.\n\nMethods: 94 CH (47 during in-bout [CH-in], and 47 during out-of-bout period [CH-out]) and 47 healthy controls (CTL) were analyzed. VBM and SBM were applied to investigate between-group differences. Averaged volumes or cortical thicknesses from regions showing group differences were correlated with clinical parameters.\n\nResults: Compared with CTL, VBM showed reduction of gray matter volume (GMV) in multiple areas, confined to the pain matrix, in patients with CH (CH-all), CH-in and CH-out. Increased GMV at bil putamen was observed in CH-all and CH-in, but not CH-out, suggesting this effect may be derived from CH-in. SBM revealed a reduction of cortical thickness in ant/mid cingulate, and bil insula cortices in CH-all and CH-in, but not CH-out, suggesting CH-in contributed to this effect. Additionally, the cortical thickness at right insula correlated negatively with disease duration in CH-in group.\n\nConclusion: CH-in and CH-out showed distinct morphological changes. Both groups showed reduced GMV in regions within the pain-processing network, while CH-in additionally presented with reduced cortical thickness over bil insular and cingulate cortices, and increased volume in bil putamen. These changes may be related to trait- and state-dependent effects.\n\nAL07 I stay at home with headache. A survey to investigate the effects of lockdown on headache in Italian children\n\nL.

Papetti\n\nObjective: The present Italian multicenter study aimed at investigating whether the course of primary headache disorders in children and adolescents was changed during the lockdown necessary to contain the COVID-19 emergency in Italy.\n\nMethods: During the lockdown, we submitted an online questionnaire to patients already diagnosed with primary headache disorders. Questions explored the course of headache, daily habits, psychological factors related to COVID-19, general mood and school stress.\n\nResults: We collected the answers of 707 patients. In the multivariate analysis, we found that reduction of school effort and anxiety was the main factor explaining the improvement in the subjective trend of headache and the intensity and frequency of the attacks (p < 0.001). The greater the severity of headache, the larger was the clinical improvement (p < 0.001). Disease duration was negatively associated with the improvement (p < 0.001). It is noteworthy that clinical improvement was independent of prophylaxis (p > 0.05), presence of chronic headache disorders (p > 0.05) and geographical area (p > 0.05).\n\nConclusions: Our study showed that lifestyle modification represents the main factor impacting the course of primary headache disorders in children and adolescents. In particular, reduction in school-related stress during the lockdown was the main factor explaining the general headache improvement in our population.\n\nAL08 Patient Experience of Telemedicine for Headache Care during the COVID-19 Pandemic: an American Migraine Foundation Survey Study\n\nC.

C. Chiang\n\nObjective: We sought to investigate the patient experience of telemedicine for headache care during the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nMethods: The American Migraine Foundation designed a standardized electronic questionnaire to assess the patient experience of telemedicine for headache care between March and September 2020. The questionnaire was distributed electronically to more than 100,000 members through social media platforms and email database.\n\nResults: A total of 1172 patients responded to our electronic questionnaire, with 1098 complete responses. 93.8% patients had a previous headache diagnosis. 648 patients reported they had used telemedicine for headache care during. 85.5% patients used it for follow up and 14.5% for new patient visits. During the telemedicine encounters, 43.7% were evaluated by headache specialists, 34.4% by general neurologists, 30.7% by primary care providers, 11.3% by headache nurse practitioners. 7.4% patients received a new headache diagnosis, and a new treatment was prescribed for 52.3% patients. 82.8% of patients rated the telemedicine headache care experience as \"very good\" or \"good\". 89.8% patients indicated that they would continue to use telemedicine for their headache care.\n\nConclusions: Our study evaluating the patient perspective demonstrated that telemedicine facilitated headache care for many patients during the COVID-19 pandemic, resulting in high patient satisfaction rates, and a desire to continue to utilize telemedicine for future headache care.\n\nAL09 Cerebral venous thrombosis (CVT) associated with COVID-19 infection; A multi-center study\n\nS. H. Shaikh\n\nAga Khan University, Neurology, Karachi, Pakistan\n\nBackground: Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has an increased propensity for systemic hypercoagulability and thromboembolism. An association of cerebrovascular diseases especially CVT has been reported among these patients. The objective of the present study is to identify risk factors, presentation, and outcome of CVT in COVID-19 patients.\n\nMethods: It is a multicenter and multinational prospective observational study. Ten centers in four countries participated in this study. Study included patients (aged > 18 years) with symptomatic CVT and recent COVID-19 infection.\n\nResults: 20 patients (70% men) were included. Mean age was 42.4 years with a male to female ratio of 2.3:1. Headache (85%) and seizures (65%) were the common neurological features with a mean admission Glasgow Coma Score (GCS) of 13. Respiratory symptoms were absent in 45% of the patients. The most common MRI finding was infarction (65%). Superior sagittal sinus (65%) was the most common site for thrombosis. Acute inflammatory markers were raised. Homocysteine was elevated in half of the cases. Mortality rate was 20%. A good functional outcome was seen in the surviving patients with a mRS at discharge was 1.3.\n\nConclusion: COVID-19 patients are at high risk for CVT secondary to the high incidence of systemic thromboembolism. CVT should be suspected in COVID-19 patients presenting with headache or seizures. Mortality is high but the functional neurological outcome is good among survivors.\n\nAL010 The characteristics of COVID-19 vaccine-related headache\n\nE. Ekizoglu1, H. Gezegen1, P.

Ekizoglu\n\nObjective: Headache is the most common neurological symptom during COVID-19 and a frequent adverse event after viral vaccines. We aimed to investigate the frequency and clinical associations of COVID-19 vaccine-related headache.\n\nMethods: We developed a detailed web-based questionnaire screening headache following vaccination in healthcare professionals who received at least one dose of COVID-19 vaccine. We investigated the associations of this headache with primary headache disorders, main comorbid conditions, headache history during COVID-19 or following influenza vaccine.\n\nResults: A total of 1247 participants (mean age, 47.6±12.3 years;860 females) contributed to the survey;131 (10.5%) had been infected with COVID-19, being asymptomatic or mildly symptomatic in 111 (84.7%). Nearly one-third of all participants (386;31%) had headache after vaccination; 99(25.6%) experienced headache lasting more than two days. The diagnosis of primary headache disorders and migraine were significantly more frequent in participants having COVID-19 vaccine-related headache (p<0.000; p<0.000). The rates of headache during COVID-19 or following influenza vaccine were also significantly higher (p=0.003 and p<0.000). Thyroid diseases showed also a significant association(p=0.001).\n\nConclusion: Headache is a frequent adverse event following the COVID-19 vaccine and mostly experienced by people with primary headache disorders, having headache during COVID-19 or headache related to other viral vaccines.\n\nAL011 Gray matter cortical changes in patients with persistent headache after COVID-19 infection: an exploratory study\n\nÁ.

Planchuelo-Gómez\n\nObjective: To evaluate gray matter alterations in patients with persistent headache after COVID-19 resolution.\n\nMethods: Exploratory case-control study. High-resolution 3D brain T1-weighted Magnetic Resonance Imaging data were acquired in patients with persistent headache after COVID-19 infection and healthy controls (HC). FreeSurfer (version 6.0) was employed to segment the T1-weighted images and extract the mean values of the cortical curvature (CC) and thickness (CT), surface area (SA) and gray matter volume (GMV) of 68 cortical regions. GMV comparisons were adjusted for intracranial volume. Significant results were considered with p < 0.05 (False Discovery Rate corrected).\n\nResults: Ten patients with persistent headache after COVID-19 (mean age: 53.8 ± 7.8 years; nine women) and 10 HC balanced for age and sex (mean age: 53.1 ± 7.0 years; nine women) were included in the study. Significant higher mean SA and GMV values were found in patients with persistent headache compared to HC in the bilateral medial orbitofrontal cortex, left rostral middle frontal gyrus, and right pars opercularis and superior frontal gyrus. In the patients, significant higher GMV in the right caudal anterior cingulate gyrus and SA values in five temporal, frontal and parietal regions were observed. No CC or CT changes were found.\n\nConclusions: Persistent headache after COVID-19 infection is related to gray matter cortical changes defined by higher GMV and SA values mainly localized in frontal regions.\n\nAL012 Comparison of quantitative headache parameters of headache after vaccination against COVID-19 (Coronavirus SARS-CoV-2) with AZD1222, BNT162b2, mRNA-1273 and BBIBP-CorV vaccines\n\nC.

Göbel\n\nBackground: It is not yet known whether the phenotypes of headache after of vaccination against COVID-19 differ with the various available vaccines. This study aims to compare quantitative headache parameters of headache after COVID-19 vaccination with AZD1222 (AstraZeneca), BNT162b2 (BioNTech/Pfizer), mRNA-1273 (Moderna) and BBIBP-CorV (Sinopharm).\n\nMethods: The study is a continuous prospective multicenter observational cohort study taking place during the Covid-19 vaccination campaign. With a publicly available online questionnaire, specific aspects of the headache phenotype, the vaccine used and related variables were collected globally. This is an interim analysis after vaccination with AZD1222 (n=2464), BNT162b2 (n=3285), mRNA-1273 (n=583) and BBIBP-CorV (n=252).\n\nFindings: Headache intensity on the VRS (0-5) was as follows: AZD1222 (3.58±0.90), BNT162b2 (3.37±0.86), mRNA-1273 (3.46±0.84) and BBIBP-CorV (3.06±0.88). The headache intensity after vaccination with AZD1222 was found to be significantly higher than that of the other vaccines. The latency of headache onset after vaccination with AZD1222 was found to be significantly less than that of the other vaccines. The headache duration after vaccination with AZD1222 was found to be significantly longer compared to BBIBP-CorV.\n\nInterpretation: Quantitative parameters of headache after Covid-19 vaccination are strongest after vaccination with AZD1222 compared to other vaccines, and least pronounced with BBIBP-CorV.\n\nAL013 Heat Pain Threshold and Mechanical Punctate Pain Threshold Predict Treatment Outcomes of Patients with Chronic Migraine\n\nL.

L. Pan\n\nObjectives: We aimed to investigate whether the quantitative sensory testing (QST) was associated with treatment outcomes in patients with chronic migraine (CM.)\n\nMethods: Treatment-naïve CM patients were prospectively recruited from the headache clinic. The subjects underwent the QST assessments, focusing on thermal and mechanical pain thresholds over the supraorbital area (V1) and medial forearm (T1) at baseline. They were asked to keep headache diaries for four weeks as baseline before routine preventive treatment and at 3-month follow-up. The responders were defined as at least a 50% reduction in average headache days of the 3 months after intervention from baseline headache days.\n\nResults: Eighty-four CM patients (Table 1) finished the study. Significant differences were found between responders and non-responders in several baseline QST parameters, including heat pain threshold (HPT) and mechanical punctate pain threshold (MPT). Multiple logistic regression showed that V1 HPT (OR: 1.28, p = 0.002), V1 MPT (OR: 1.02, p = 0.014), and T1 warm detection threshold (OR: 0.33, p = 0.013) were associated with the treatment outcomes and overall prediction percentage was 83.3% with Nagelkerke R2 of 40.4%. (Table 2)\n\nConclusions: CM patients who were less sensitive to heat and punctate stimuli were more likely to improve in headache days after 3-month treatment.\n\nAL014 Migraine-Related Absenteeism is Associated with Total Healthcare and Pharmaceutical Costs – A US-Based Real World Longitudinal Analysis\n\nL.

Coric1\n\n1Biohaven Pharmaceuticals, New Haven, CT, United States; 2Decision Resources Group, Bangalore, India; 3Decision Resources Group, Boston, MA, United States\n\nCorrespondence: L. Harris\n\nObjective: Use real-world data to assess absenteeism and healthcare utilization and cost among adults with migraine.\n\nMethods: Claims and EMR data (January 2016-June 2019) for US adults with a diagnosis of migraine and ≥1 Migraine Disability Assessment (MIDAS) score were analyzed. Subjects were classified by treatment setting (primary care or specialist) and categorized by MIDAS score range (0, 1-5, 6-10, 11-30, and >30) into 5 levels of absenteeism from work or school. The association between absenteeism and total healthcare costs (office visits and treatments) was assessed with a series of GLM models adjusted for sex, Charlson comorbidity index, payer channel, and patient comorbidity and migraine flags.\n\nResults: The study population (N=7662) had a mean age of 50 years; 79% were female, and 63% were commercially insured. Migraine-related absenteeism was observed in 69% of the cohort; 41% had at least a moderate level of absenteeism (Figure 1). Absenteeism was positively correlated with medical claims and pharmacy costs regardless of treatment setting (Table 1). Frequent absenteeism and specialist treatment was associated with the highest costs, mainly due to higher costs for medications.\n\nConclusion: Migraine-related absenteeism was common and directly associated with healthcare costs. The relationship was strongest in subjects with MIDAS scores exceeding 30 who had received specialty care. Improvements in migraine treatment may reduce rates of absenteeism and healthcare costs.\n\nAL015 Association between suicidal risks and medication-overuse headache in chronic migraine: a cross-sectional study\n\nC.

F. Wang\n\nObjectives: To determine whether medication-overuse headache (MOH), like other substance use disorders, is associated with an increased risk for suicide.\n\nMethods: This prospective cross-sectional study enrolled newly diagnosed chronic migraine (CM) patients with or without coexisting MOH. Headache diagnoses were made through face-to-face interviews by headache specialists, and a specifically designed questionnaire was used to collect clinical characteristics. Suicidal ideation and prior suicide attempt were specifically questioned.\n\nResults: In total, 603 CM patients (485F/118M, mean age 42.03±12.18 years) were recruited, including 320 with MOH (257F/63M, mean age 42.8±11.7 years) (53.1%), and 214 (35.5%) and 81 (13.4%) had suicidal ideation and prior suicide attempt, respectively. Among CM patients, the presence of MOH increased the risks of suicidal ideation (odds ratio [OR]=1.75 [95% CI=1.20-2.56], p=0.004) and prior suicide attempt (OR=1.88 [1.09-3.24], p=0.024), after controlling for demographics, headache profile, disabilities, symptoms of anxiety and depression, and sleep quality.\n\nConclusions: In CM patients, MOH is associated with an increased risk for suicidal ideation and prior suicide attempt, which deserves attention for clinicians taking care of headache patients. However, further studies are needed to determine the causal relationship, as well as the underlying pathophysiology.\n\nAL016 Migraine is not Associated with Incident Stroke: The Rotterdam Study\n\nC.

Acarsoy\n\nObjective: A (causal) link between migraine and stroke has been implicated, however so far there is no conclusive answer. In this study, we determined the association between migraine and the risk of stroke.\n\nMethods: This study is based on the on-going prospective Rotterdam Study. Between 2006 and 2011, we included 6925 (mean age 65.7 years, 57.8 % women) participants who did not suffer from previous stroke. At baseline, migraine was assessed with a structured interview based on ICHD-2 criteria. After a median follow-up of 6.4 years, 195 participants developed a stroke. The association between migraine and risk of stroke were analyzed using Cox proportional-hazards regression models. The models were adjusted for age and additionally for cardiovascular, metabolic, lifestyle and psychological risk factors and stratified by sex.\n\nResults: At baseline 1030 (14.9%) participants were diagnosed with migraine. We found no association between migraine and stroke (hazard ratio [HR] 1.40, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.94-2.09). The results for the different subtypes of migraine were similar (active vs non-active, HR 1.59, CI 0.82-3.05; aura present vs absent, HR 1.45, CI 0.64-3.30). With respect to stroke subtypes, we found no association with ischemic stroke (HR 1.45, CI 0.94-2.24).\n\nConclusion: Our findings suggest that migraine is not associated with stroke in neither men nor women.\n\nAL017 Physical inactivity and headache disorders in the ELSA-Brasil cohort: A cross-sectional analysis\n\nA. Oliveira1,2,3, J. Mercante1,2,3, M. Peres2,3, M. D. C. Molina4,5, P. Lotufo1, I. Benseñor1, A. Goulart1\n\n1Universidade de São Paulo, Center for Clinical and Epidemiological Research, São Paulo, Brazil; 2Hospital Israelita Albert Einstein, Instituto do Cérebro, São Paulo, Brazil; 3Universidade de São Paulo, Instituto de Psiquiatria, São Paulo, Brazil; 4Universidade Federal de Ouro Preto, Nutrição e Saúde, Ouro Preto, Brazil; 5Universidade Federal do Espírito Santo, Vitória, Brazil\n\nCorrespondence: A. Oliveira\n\nObjective: To test the associations between headache disorders and physical inactivity in the ELSA-Brasil cohort.\n\nMethods: In a cross-sectional analysis, logistic regression models computed the odds ratio (OR) for headache disorders according to physical activity levels in the leisure-time (LTPA) and commuting (CPA).\n\nResults: Of 15,105 participants, 14,847 (54.4 % women) provided data on physical activity levels and headache. In the adjusted models, LTPA-physical inactivity associated with definite migraine [OR: 1.32 (1.10-1.57)] and probable migraine [OR: 1.33 (1.17-1.50)] in the whole cohort. In women, it associated with definite migraine [OR: 1.29 (1.04-1.59)] and probable migraine [OR: 1.29 (1.04-1.59)]. In men, LTPA-physical inactivity only associated with probable migraine [OR: 1.40 (1.15-1.69)]. CPA-physical inactivity associated with probable tension-type headache in men [OR: 1.33 (1.01-1.75)], while it inversely associated with definite migraine [OR: 0.79 (0.64-0.98)] and probable migraine [OR: 0.80 (0.67-0.96)] in women. LTPA-vigorous physical inactivity associated with definite migraine [OR: 1.36 (1.13-1.65)] and probable migraine [OR: 1.37 (1.20-1.57)]. There was a strong linear trend for the association between physical inactivity and headache attack frequency (p-trend < 0.001).\n\nConclusion: Physical inactivity is associated with headache with distinct associations regarding headache subtype, sex, physical activity domain, intensity, and headache frequency.\n\nAL018 Direct costs for headache disorders. Data from a brazilian health maintenance organization\n\nM. Peres1,2, J. Brito3, R. Pires3, A. Oliveira4,5\n\n1IPq-HCFMUSP, São Paulo, Brazil; 2Hospital Albert Einstein, São Paulo, Brazil; 3NotreDame Intermedica, São Paulo, Brazil; 4ABRACES, São Paulo, Brazil; 5Universidade de Sao Paulo, Center for Clinical and Epidemiological Research, São Paulo, Brazil\n\nCorrespondence: M. Peres\n\nBackground: Primary and secondary headache disorders are significant players in direct and inderect costs worldwide. People who experience migraine have increased healthcare use. Limited information about this scenario is available in Brazil. Objective. To analyze direct costs related to headache disorders in a Brazilian healthcare maintenance organization (HMO).\n\nMethods: Data from the HMO NotreDame Intermedica (Sao Paulo, Brazil) claims related to health care costs due to headache disorders (ICD-10 G43-44, G50, R51) were retrieved, from 2018 to 2020. Results. Outpatient medical consultations were in average 14,148 per year. Emergency room patients were 29,035, emergency room visits were 39,149, with a total cost of R$ 3,442,586 (USD 611,960). Diagnostic exames 19,328 cost R$ 913,764.00 (US$ 162,432.00). 532.584 patients accessed one headache health care provider, 10.8% of the total population insured in 2018, 12.1% in 2019, and 11.4% in 2020, in total R$ 38,994,440.00 (USD 6,931,729.00). Most headaches were coded R 51 (headache not otherwise specified).\n\nConclusion: Headache disorders are significant contributors for the economic burden in health maintenance organization.\n\nAL019 Is behaviour of neck pain related to cervical musculoskeletal dysfunction (CMD) or hypersensitivity in migraine?\n\nZ. Liang1, L. Thomas1, G. Jull1, H. Zareie2, J. Treleaven1\n\n1The University of Queensland, School of Health and Rehabilitation Sciences, St Lucia, Australia; 2Royal Brisbane & Women's Hospital, Neurology, Herston, Australia\n\nCorrespondence: Z. Liang\n\nObjective: To investigate if temporal behaviour of neck pain relates to presence of CMD or hypersensitivity.\n\nMethods: Participants (n=108) completed daily online surveys for a month, recording the presence of headache (usual migraine or not) and neck pain. Hypersensitivity was assessed using Allodynia Symptom Checklist (ASC12) and pressure pain thresholds (PPTs). Presence of CMD was determined previously by overall performance across eight cervical measures using cluster analysis for migraineurs, individuals with idiopathic neck pain and healthy controls. Fisher Exact test was used to determine if temporal behaviour categories of neck pain was related to presence of CMD.\n\nResults: In the month, 16 did not experience migraine or neck pain leaving 92 participants (46 usual migraine only, 46 usual migraine plus another headache). All participants reported ictal neck pain. Temporal behaviour of neck pain in participants was categorised as ictal only (n=42), infrequent interictal (n=26), frequent interictal (n=17), undecipherable pattern (n=7). CMD was present in 43% and was unrelated to temporal behaviour of neck pain in all migraineurs. Temporal behaviour of neck pain was also not associated with ASC12 and PPTs. Results were similar for all migraineurs, with or without another headache.\n\nConclusions: Temporal behaviour of neck pain does not indicate if CMD is present in migraine. Overlapping peripheral and central mechanisms are likely to explain neck pain behaviour.\n\nAL020 Withdrawn\n\nAL021 Sex differences in the migraine attack burden and the genetics of migraine\n\nM. A. Chalmer, I. Callesen, L. J. A. Kogelman, J. Olesen, T. F. Hansen\n\nRigshospitalet-Glostrup, Danish Headache Center, Glostrup, Denmark\n\nCorrespondence: M. A. Chalmer\n\nObjectives & Background: Migraine affects 2-3 times more women than men. Sex differences in the migraine attacks are important for a full understanding of the burden of the migraine attacks in the two sexes. Genetic differences might explain the high attack burden in women. First, we quantitated sex differences in attack frequency, severity, and other clinical parameters, to get the full picture of the migraine attack burden in the two sexes. Secondly, we assessed if genetics might contribute to such differences.\n\nMethods: Cohort of 62,672 individuals (9,212 women, 3,446 men with migraine) from the Danish Blood Donor Study. Migraine diagnosis was made by an extensive questionnaire (specificity and a sensitivity: 93%).\n\nResults: The male-female ratio was 1:2.7. Women did not have a higher migraine attack frequency, but their attacks had a higher severity of pain, longer duration, more often unilateral, pulsating, exacerbated by physical activity, more often accompanied by nausea, vomiting, phonophobia, osmophobia, and allodynia. Women had more headache days unspecified, some of which might have been migraine. Among the 123 genome-wide migraine risk variants, 3 migraine risk variants were significant among women only.\n\nConclusion: The migraine attack burden per woman is higher than per man. Our genetic analyses show that genetic variants have different effects in women vs men, this may explain the burden difference between sexes. We are currently working on more genetic results.\n\nAL022 Primary Headache Disorders and Acute Medications Associated With Medication Overuse Headache: Analysis of US Claims Data\n\nA. H. Ahn, K. J. Shulman, R. G. Iyer, A. Rubin, L. J. Krasenbaum, S. Reshef, S. Lim\n\nTeva Branded Pharmaceutical Products R&D, Inc., West Chester, PA, United States\n\nCorrespondence: A. H. Ahn\n\nObjective: Medication overuse headache (MOH), a secondary headache (HA) disorder, arises from frequent acute HA medication use for primary HA disorders (migraine or tension-type HA [TTH]). This retrospective, cross-sectional cohort study using data from the IBM/Watson MarketScan® medical claims database characterized patients (pts) with MOH, their primary HA, and prescribed acute HA medication.\n\nMethods: Pts with MOH were categorized by the following primary HA diagnoses: migraine only, TTH only, other primary HA only, multiple primary HA diagnoses, and \"no primary HA specified.\" Demographic characteristics and prescribed acute HA medication classes (triptans, ergotamines, barbiturates, opioids, non-opioid analgesics, combination analgesics, multiple medications) were evaluated.\n\nResults: Among patients (n=29,124) with a MOH diagnosis, mean age was 41.4 years; 78.8% were female. Single primary HA diagnoses were identified in about half of MOH pts: migraine (45.7%), TTH (5.1%), and \"other primary HA\" (1.9%). Multiple primary HA diagnoses were found for 18.3% of pts; 29.1% had \"no primary HA specified.\" Among pts overusing acute HA medications in the MOH population (34%), overuse of multiple acute medications (78%) and combination analgesics (33%) were most common (not mutually exclusive).\n\nConclusions: These results confirm migraine and TTH to be common primary HA disorders for pts with MOH; yet, nearly half present with multiple primary or \"no specified\" primary HA diagnosis.\n\nAL023 Sex differences in the pharmacological role of TRPM3 channels and NMDA receptors in human isolated coronary arteries\n\nE. Rivera-Mancilla1, T. de Vries1, A. van den Bogaerdt2, A. H. J. Danser1, C. M. Villalón3, A. Maassen van den Brink1\n\n1Erasmus University Medical Center, Division of Vascular Medicine and Pharmacology, Department of Internal Medicine, Rotterdam, Netherlands; 2ETB-BISLIFE, Heart Valve Department, Beverwijk, Netherlands; 3Cinvestav-Coapa, Pharmacobiology, Mexico City, Mexico\n\nCorrespondence: E. Rivera-Mancilla\n\nBackground: Pregnenolone sulfate (PregS) activates transient receptor potential (TRP) channels and N‑methyl‑D‑aspartate (NMDA) receptors, which are involved in the regulation of the vascular tone and in the pathophysiology of migraine. We investigated the PregS‑induced vasoactive effects and the possible mechanisms involved in human isolated coronary arteries (HCAs).\n\nMethods: In HCAs from both women (n=9, 54±5 years) and men (n=11, 46±5 years), the vasodilatory responses to PregS (0.01-100 μM) were evaluated in the absence or presence of isosakuranetin (TRPM3 antagonist, 5 μM); olcegepant (CGRP receptor antagonist, 1 μM); or MK-801 (NMDA receptor antagonist, 10 μM) to obtain the maximum contractile response (Emax).\n\nResults: PregS induced concentration-dependent relaxation in HCAs. The Emax to PregS was higher in women than in men (Emax 73±8% vs. Emax 46±5%, respectively; p<0.05), which was significantly reduced (p<0.05) in the presence of isosakuranetin (Emax 31±6% and Emax 17±8%) or olcegepant (Emax 31±8% and Emax 20±5%). In contrast, the Emax to PregS was reduced by MK-801 in women (Emax 19±8%, p<0.05) but not in men (Emax 45±12%).\n\nConclusion: (i) PregS-induced relaxation in HCAs is mediated by TRPM3 channels and the CGRP receptor; (ii) there is a differential vasoactive effect of PregS and in the role of NMDA receptors in women and in men. This may provide new therapeutic options to target the sex dimorphism in migraine and its related cardiovascular events.\n\nAL024 Response to onabotulinumtoxinA in men and women - Results from a multicenter retrospective study\n\nR.

Ornello\n\nObjectives: We aimed to provide data on the effectiveness of onabotulinumtoxinA (BT-A) for chronic migraine (CM) in men compared with women.\n\nMethods: We performed a retrospective analysis on patients with CM treated with BT-A in 16 European centers. We reported the proportion of patients with a ≥50% decrease in monthly headache days (MHDs) – \"responders\" – during the first 3 BT-A cycles compared with baseline. We also recorded the absolute numbers of MHDs. We then performed exact propensity score matching between men and women, considering age, CM duration, MHDs at baseline, and medication overuse as matching variables.\n\nResults: We included 522 men and 2357 women; men were older than women (47.8±13.2 vs 46.3±12.1 years; P=0.024). The proportion of responders in men was comparable to women during the 1st BT-A cycle (27.7% vs 26.6%; P=0.611), while it was lower during the 2nd (29.2% vs 33.7%; P=0.044) and the 3rd cycle (35.6% vs 41.2%; P=0.018). MHD decrease during treatment was significant in both sexes; however, during the 3rd cycle, mean MHDs were higher in men than in women (15.1±9.7 vs 14.0±8.7; P=0.022). After propensity score matching (84 men vs 113 women), men had more MHDs than women during the 2nd (18.8±10.2 vs 15.6±9.3; P=0.027) and the 3rd cycle (17.7±11.2 vs 13.7±9.4; P=0.010).\n\nConclusion: Our data suggest that response to BT-A might be lower in men than in women, although significant in both sexes. Sex-specific response to CM treatments merits further study.\n\nAL025 Opening of BKCa Channels Causes Migraine Attacks: A New Downstream Target for the Treatment of Migraine\n\nM. A. Al-Karagholi1, H. Ghanizada1, C. A. Nielsen1, C. Skandarioon1, J. Snellman2, C. Lopez-Lopez2, J. M. Hansen1, M. Ashina1\n\n1Danish Headache Center, Copenhagen, Denmark; 2Novartis Pharma AG, Basel, Switzerland\n\nCorrespondence: M. A. Al-Karagholi\n\nPotassium channel opening may cause migraine, and we therefore examined the migraine-inducing effect of MaxiPost, a large (big)-conductance calcium-activated potassium (BKCa) channel opener, on migraine induction and cephalic vasodilation in individuals with migraine.\n\nTwenty-six migraine without aura patients were randomly allocated to receive an infusion of MaxiPost or placebo on two study days separated by at least one week. The primary endpoint was the difference in incidence of migraine attacks after MaxiPost compared to placebo. The secondary endpoints were the difference in incidence of headaches and the difference in area under the curve (AUC) for headache intensity scores (0–12 hours), for middle cerebral artery blood flow velocity (VMCA) (0-2 hours), and for superficial temporal artery (STA) and radial artery (RA) diameter.\n\nTwenty-two patients completed the study. Twenty-one of 22 (95%) developed migraine attacks after MaxiPost compared with none after placebo (P ˂ 0.0001); the difference of incidence is 95% [95% confidence interval (CI) 86–100%]. The incidence of headache over the 12 hours observation period was higher after MaxiPost day (n= 22) than after placebo (n= 7) (P ˂ 0.0001). We found a significant increase of middle cerebral artery blood flow velocity and superficial temporal and radial arteries diameter. Because BKCa channel opening initiate migraine attacks, we suggest that BKCa channel blockers could be potential candidates for novel anti-migraine drugs.\n\nAL026 Alterations of resting-state periaqueductal gray matter connectivity in tension-type headache\n\nK.

Gecse\n\nBackground and objective: Tension-type headache (TTH) is the most prevalent type of headache in the world, however its pathophysiology is underexplored. Periaqueductal gray matter (PAG), playing a pivotal role in pain modulation network, may contribute to increased pain sensitivity observed in TTH. Our aim was to determine functional connectivity (FC) alterations of PAG in tension-type headache.\n\nMethods: Using 6-minute resting-state functional MRI, we compared PAG-FC between 32 TTH subjects (23 females), during pain-free state and 32 healthy controls (21 females) using Statistical Parametric Mapping (SPM12) toolbox in MATLAB.\n\nResults: Increased FC correlation was found between PAG and clusters in the superior medial part of frontal gyrus (family-wise error corrected p: pFWE<0.001) and right triangular part of inferior frontal gyrus (pFWE<0.001) in TTH patients compared to controls. In addition, decreased FC correlation was revealed between PAG and cuneus (pFWE<0.001) and left lingual gyrus (pFWE<0.036) in TTH patients compared to controls.\n\nConclusions: Our results suggest a disrupted PAG-FC with regions that modulate pain-related information integration and affective dimension of pain in TTH patients compared to non-headache controls. These alterations could be a consequence of increased pain sensitivity induced by repeated headaches, however the effect of headache frequency should be further investigated.\n\nAL027 Hypersensitivity to Calcitonin Gene–Related Peptide in Post-Traumatic Headache\n\nH. Ashina, A. Iljazi, H. Al-Khazali, C. Christensen, F. M. Amin, M. Ashina, H. Schytz\n\nDanish Headache Center, Neurology, Copenhagen, Denmark\n\nCorrespondence: H. Ashina\n\nObjective: To demonstrate that calcitonin gene–related peptide (CGRP) induces headache exacerbation with migraine-like features in patients with persistent post-traumatic headache (PTH) attributed to mild traumatic brain injury (TBI).\n\nMethods: A randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, two-way crossover study was conducted. Analyses were intention-to-treat. Eligible patients were aged 18 to 65 years and had a history of persistent PTH after mild TBI for at least 12 months. Patients were randomized to receive an intravenous infusion of 1.5μg/min of CGRP or placebo (isotonic saline) over 20 minutes on two separate experimental days. A 12-hour observational period was used to evaluate the following outcomes: (1) difference in incidence of headache exacerbation with migraine-like features and (2) difference in area under the curve for headache intensity scores.\n\nResults: Thirty patients were randomized and completed the study. During the 12-hour observational period, 21 of 30 patients (70%) developed headache exacerbation with migraine-like features after CGRP, compared with 6 patients (20%) after placebo (p < 0.001). The baseline-corrected area under the curve for headache intensity scores was significantly larger after CGRP, compared with placebo (p < 0.001).\n\nConclusions: Patients with persistent PTH are hypersensitive to CGRP, which underscores its pathophysiological importance.\n\nAL028 Exploring the role of the pons and hypothalamus in migraine progression\n\nR.

Filippi1\n\n1San Raffaele Scientific Institute, Neuroimaging Research Unit and Neurology Unit, Milan, Italy; 2San Raffaele Scientific Institute, Neuroimaging Research Unit, Milan, Italy; 3San Raffaele Scientific Institute, Neurology Unit, Milan, Italy\n\nCorrespondence: R. Messina\n\nObjective: The hypothalamus and dorsal pons could be putative drivers of migraine attacks. Here, we explored whether longitudinal hypothalamic and pontine resting state (RS) functional connectivity (FC) changes might influence migraine progression over time.\n\nMethods: Ninety-one headache-free episodic migraine patients and 73 controls underwent RS functional magnetic resonance imaging. Twenty-three patients and 23 controls were re-examined after 4 years. A seed-based correlation approach was used to study hypothalamic and pontine RS FC changes, separately.\n\nResults: After 4 years, migraine patients developed an increased FC between the hypothalamus and orbitofrontal gyrus (OFG), bilaterally, as well as between the left pons and left cerebellum. They also experienced decreased RS FC between the right hypothalamus and ipsilateral lingual gyrus. At baseline, the decreased hypothalamic-lingual gyrus RS FC correlated with higher migraine attack frequency. At follow-up, higher hypothalamic-OFG RS FC correlated with lower migraine attack frequency and higher pontine-cerebellar RS FC correlated with an increased number of migraine attacks over the years. A significant negative association between the pontine-cerebellar RS FC and the hypothalamic-lingual RS FC was found in migraine patients.\n\nConclusion: Our findings support the presence of a common functional framework comprising the hypothalamic, pontine, cerebellar and visual networks that might influence migraine progression.\n\nAL029 Stability of functional MRI-based migraine diagnosis: an internal validation study\n\nB. Y. Park1, S. Cho2, C. S. Chung3, M. J. Lee3\n\n1Department of Data Science, Department of Data Science, Incheon, South Korea; 2Uijeongbu Eulji Medical Center, Neurology, Uijeongbu, South Korea; 3Samsung Medical Center, Sungkyunkwan University School of Medicine, Neurology, Seoul, South Korea\n\nCorrespondence: B. Y. Park\n\nObjective: To test the reliability of functional MRI (fMRI)-based diagnosis of migraine using an internal validation set which was followed up with 1-year interval.\n\nMethods: We prospectively recruited 50 patients with episodic migraine and 50 age-sex-matched healthy controls (HCs). Participants underwent resting-state fMRI at baseline and after 1 year. Interictal pairs (patients and matched HCs) at baseline were used to build a diagnostic model using regularized graph-based functional connectivity measures and non-linear classifier. We tested the model with 5-fold nested cross-validation and repeated 100 times with different training/test dataset. The diagnostic performance was validated using 1-year follow-up data of the same pairs and interictal pairs.\n\nResults: Among 100 participants, 46 patients and 43 HCs completed the follow-up fMRI scan. The training set included 16 pairs (n=32) and showed a diagnostic accuracy of 79.4 ± 4.60% across repetitions. Nine interictal patients at baseline were switched to peri-ictal/ictal at follow up, and the diagnostic accuracy decreased to 55.2%. When 21 patients who were interictal at follow up and matched HCs were tested, the diagnostic accuracy was 66.7%.\n\nConclusions: Whole-brain connectivity obtained from resting-state fMRI may not be stable over time, and the accuracy of fMRI-based diagnosis is subject to migraine phases. A rigorous validation should be performed before the fMRI can be used as a diagnostic modality for migraine.\n\nAL030 T2* Contrast Changes in Post-traumatic Headache\n\nS. Nikolova1, T. J. Schwedt1, C. Chong1, G. Dumkrieger1, T. Wu2, V. Berisha2, J. Li3, K. Ross4\n\n1Mayo Clinic, Neurology, Phoenix, AZ, United States; 2Arizona State University, Phoenix, AZ, United States; 3Georgia Tech, Atlanta, GA, United States; 4PVAHCS, Phoenix, AZ, United States\n\nCorrespondence: S. Nikolova\n\nBackground and Objective: To compare brain T2* contrast, commonly associated with iron accumulation, between individuals with post traumatic headache (PTH) attributed to mild traumatic brain injury (mTBI), and healthy age-balanced controls (HC). Additionally, we aimed to interrogate whether in subjects with PTH changes in T2* contrast associates with headache frequency and number of mTBIs.\n\nMethods: We included 20 individuals with PTH (mean age=41.3; SD=11.9) following mTBI and 20 healthy controls (mean age= 40.5; SD= 12.4). Between group differences on T2* were evaluated within SPM12 using cluster volume thresholding (>25 mm3; p< 0.01)\n\nResults: Compared to HC, subjects with PTH had less T2* contrast in the right hippocampus, right amygdala, right insula, the anterior commissure, the pons as well as the right supramarginal, left temporal and left occipital areas. In the PTH group T2* contrast in the right supplemental motor area, bilateral precuneus and bilateral insula negatively correlated with headache frequency and right supramarginal T2* contrast negatively correlated with number of mTBIs.\n\nConclusion: PTH was associated with lower T2* contrast indicating higher iron accumulation in cortical, limbic and brainstem areas. For subjects with PTH, there was a negative association between T2* contrast with headache frequency and number of mTBIs suggesting that increased headache burden and number of mTIBs associate with accumulative iron load.\n\nAL031 Part I: The impact of diet-induced obesity on intracranial pressure in a rodent model of non-traumatic intracranial hypertension\n\nI. Israelsen, C. James Westgate, R. H. Jensen, S. Eftekhari\n\nDanish Headache Center, Copenhagen, Denmark\n\nCorrespondence: I. Israelsen\n\nObjectives: Idiopathic intracranial hypertension (IIH) is a disorder characterized by increased intracranial pressure (ICP) and strongly linked to obesity. We aimed to explore the impact of diet-induced obesity (DIO) on ICP with the dual goal of developing a model for non-traumatic raised ICP.\n\nMethods: 28 female Sprague-Dawley rats received high-fat diet (60% fat) or control diet for 17 weeks. Selected rats were implanted with telemetric probe for continuous ICP recordings for 30 days. At baseline body composition was measured with dual energy x-ray absorptiometry. Molecular analysis of aquaporin 1 (AQP1) and Na-K-2Cl-1 cotransporter (NKCC1) was studied in choroid plexus (CP) from the implanted rat after 30 days.\n\nResults: Mean ICP was raised by 55 % in the DIO rats over 14 days (2.32±1.65 vs 4.57±1.60 mmHg, P=0.019). ICP was also correlated with abdominal fat percentage (r=0.54, P=0.016). We observed an increase in the spectral power of ICP wavelengths at 0-0.25Hz representing non-respiratory slow ICP waves (0.24±0.09 vs 1.09±0.3 mmHg2, P=0.02) seven days after surgery. The DIO rats also exhibited a tendency to increased protein expression in the ratio of glycosylated AQP1 to total expression (0.46±0.03 vs 0.59±0.06 AU, P=0.084). NKCC1 protein expression was also changed by 1.3-fold (3.4±0.78 vs 4.7±0.92 AU, P=0.43).\n\nConclusions: DIO leads to raised ICP in rats. This may serve as model for non-traumatic raised ICP to expand the knowledge regarding the pathophysiology of IIH.\n\nAL032 Part III: Neuroretinal changes in a rodent model of diet-induced obesity with raised intracranial pressure\n\nS.

Eftekhari2\n\n1Rigshospitalet-Glostrup, Department of Ophthalmology, Glostrup, Denmark; 2Rigshospitalet-Glostrup, Danish Headache Center, Department of Neurology, Glostrup, Denmark; 3University of Copenhagen, SUND, Copenhagen, Denmark\n\nCorrespondence: S. Hagen\n\nObjectives: The mechanisms driving increased intracranial pressure (ICP) and neuroretinal degeneration have not been clarified. We evaluated the structural changes of the peripapillary retina in a newly developed rat model with of non-traumatic raised ICP using diet-induced obesity (DIO) mimicking key features of IIH.\n\nMethods: 14 DIO and 10 control Sprague-Dawley rats were included for dual energy x-ray absorptiometry (DEXA, evaluating abdominal fat percentage) and spectral domain optical coherence tomography (OCT) scans prior to implantation of ICP telemeter. OCT-scans were analyzed using a semi-automatic segmentation software and the retinal nerve fiber layer (RNFL) thickness was measured in a blinded design. Histology and measurement of retinal nerve fiber bundles (RNFB) thickness in the anterior preliminary region of the optic cup were performed.\n\nResults: DIO animals with raised ICP (4.40±0.85 mmHg) had significant thicker RNFL compared to control animals (28.82±0.61 vs 24.85±1.09 μm, p=.003). We found positive correlations between RNFL thickness and ICP (r=0.64, P=.006), body weight (r=0.57, p=.005) and DEXA abdominal fat percentage (r=0.47, p=.021). DIO animals showed thinner RNFB compared to control animals in histological sections of the optic nerve head (p=.014).\n\nConclusion: DIO rats with elevated ICP develop peripapillary RNFL swelling followed by neuroretinal degeneration as seen in acute IIH patients with papilledema, illustrating the high risk of permanent damage.\n\nAL033 Amylin analog pramlintide induces migraine-like attacks in patients\n\nH. Ghanizada\n\nDanish Headache Center, Neurology, Taastrup, Denmark\n\nObjective: Migraine is a prevalent and disabling neurological disease. Its genesis is poorly understood and there remains unmet clinical need. We aimed to identify mechanisms and thus novel therapeutic targets for migraine using human models of migraine and translational models in animals, with emphasis on amylin, a close relative of calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP)\n\nMethods: Thirty-six migraine without aura patients were enrolled in a randomized, double-blinded, two-way, cross-over, positive-controlled clinical trial study to receive infusion of an amylin analogue pramlintide or human αCGRP on two different experimental days. Furthermore, translational studies in cells and mouse models, and rat and human tissue samples were conducted.\n\nResults: Thirty patients (88%) developed headache after pramlintide infusion, compared to thirty-three (97%) after CGRP (p = 0.375). Fourteen patients (41%) developed migraine-like attacks after pramlintide infusion, compared to nineteen patients (56%) after CGRP (p = 0.180). The pramlintide-induced migraine-like attacks had similar clinical characteristics to those induced by CGRP. There were differences between treatments in vascular parameters.\n\nInterpretation: Our findings propose amylin receptor agonism as a novel contributor to migraine pathogenesis. Greater therapeutic gains could therefore be made for migraine patients through dual amylin and CGRP receptor antagonism, rather than selectively targeting the canonical CGRP receptor.\n\nAL034 New daily persistent headache: clinical characteristics and treatment responses in 366 patients\n\nS.

Cheema\n\nObjective: To describe clinical characteristics and treatment responses in a large cohort of patients with new daily persistent headache (NDPH).\n\nMethods: Descriptive analysis of data extracted from routinely collected clinical records in consecutive patients with primary NDPH seen in a secondary and tertiary headache clinic between 2007 and 2019.\n\nResults: 366 patients met inclusion criteria, mean age 37.9 years, 62.6% female. 140 (38.8%) had an identifiable precipitant, most commonly a flu-like viral illness. 23 (6.3%) had a thunderclap headache at onset.\n\nAccording to ICHD-3 criteria, 63.7% had characteristics of chronic migraine (CM), 27.6% of chronic tension type headache (CTTH), and 8.7% met neither criteria.\n\nThe most common comorbid diagnoses were depression, anxiety, and joint hypermobility disorder. 87.1% and 87.2% were within the severely disabled range on the Headache Impact Test-6 and Migraine Disability Assessment scores respectively.\n\nResponse to the majority of acute, preventive, and injectable treatments was poor, with only a small proportion of patients experiencing >30% improvement in either headache severity or frequency. The most effective preventive treatments were doselupin in 37 patients (45.7% responders, 95% CI 34.8-56.5%) and onabotulinumtoxinA in 55 patients (34.2% responders, 95% CI 26.8-41.5%).\n\nConclusions: NDPH is a highly disabling disorder, which may have features of CM or CTTH, but is often refractory to treatments used in CM and CTTH.\n\nAL035 Using Optical Coherence Tomography as a Surrogate of Measurements of Intracranial Pressure in Idiopathic Intracranial Hypertension\n\nS.

Mitchell\n\nBackground: To determine whether Optical Coherence Tomography (OCT) of the optic nerve head in papilloedema could act as a surrogate measure of intracranial pressure (ICP).\n\nMethods: This is a longitudinal cohort study using data collected from three randomised controlled trials, between from April 1st, 2014 to August, 1st 2019. OCT imaging and automated perimetry was followed immediately by ICP measurement on the same day. Cohort 1 utilised continuous sitting telemetric ICP monitoring (Raumedic Neurovent P-tel device) on one visit. Cohort 2 were evaluated at baseline, 3, 12 and 24 months and underwent lumbar puncture assessment of ICP.\n\nResults: 104 patients were recruited. Amongst cohort 1 (n=15), the range of OCT protocols were evaluated and optic nerve head central thickness was found to be most closely associated with ICP (right eye: p=0.017, r = 0.60; left eye: p = 0.002; r = 0.73). Subsequently, cohort 2 (n=89) confirmed the correlation between central thickness and ICP longitudinally (12 and 24 months). Finally, bootstrap surrogacy analysis noted a positive association between central thickness and ICP treatment effects at all time points (e.g. at 12 months, an decrease in central thickness of 50μm predicted a decrease in ICP of 5 cmCSF).\n\nConclusion: OCT optic nerve head volume measures reproducibly correlates with ICP and surrogacy analysis demonstrated its ability to inform ICP changes. This data suggests that OCT can non-invasively predict ICP.\n\nAL036 CGRP and the AMY1 receptor: Identifying Targets for Migraine\n\nT. Rees1,2, S. O'Carroll3, C. Le Foll4, T. Lutz4, C. Walker1,2, D. Hay1,2,5\n\n1University of Auckland, School of Biological Sciences, Auckland, New Zealand; 2Maurice Wilkins Centre for Molecular discovery, Auckland, New Zealand; 3University of Auckland, Faculty of Medical and Health Sciences, Auckland, New Zealand; 4University of Zurich, Institute of Veterinary Physiology, Zurich, Switzerland; 5University of Otago, Department of Pharmacology and Toxicology, North Dunedin, New Zealand\n\nCorrespondence: T. Rees\n\nObjective: Calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) has been proposed to act in an auto-regulatory manner in the trigeminal ganglia (TG), to increase CGRP expression and responsiveness. However, in the TG, CGRP and its canonical receptor, the CGRP receptor, are reportedly not co-expressed. The AMY1 receptor, a dual receptor for both CGRP and amylin, is also reported to be expressed in the TG. Therefore, we aimed to compare the relative distribution of CGRP and amylin with the AMY1 receptor component, calcitonin receptor (CTR), in the TG.\n\nMethods: CGRP, amylin and CTR antibodies were thoroughly validated for specificity and cross-reactivity. Mouse, rat, and human TG sections were then double or triple-immunostained with the lead antibodies and neuronal markers, β tubulin III and NF200.\n\nResults: Anti-CGRP antibodies displayed good specificity in immunoblots and immunohistochemistry. The lead CTR antibodies strongly detected CTR in cell models and displayed a marked loss of staining in KO mouse models. CTR and CGRP immunoreactivity frequently colocalised in rodent TG sections, primarily in C-fibre neurons, and infrequently in A-fibre neurons. Interestingly, anti-amylin antibodies frequently displayed cross-reactivity with CGRP, and lead antibodies demonstrated a lack of amylin-like immunoreactivity.\n\nConclusions: In TG C-fibre neurons, CGRP could be acting via the AMY1 receptor in an autocrine manner. Circulating amylin may also activate this receptor in the TG.\n\nAL037 The Effects of P2X7 Antagonism on Neuroinflammation Following Optogenetically-Triggered Cortical Spreading Depression\n\nB. Uzay1, B. Donmez-Demir1, S. Yilmaz-Ozcan1, E. Eren-Kocak1,2, M. Yemisci1,3, T. Dalkara1, H. Karatas1\n\n1Hacettepe University, Institute of Neurological Sciences and Psychiatry, Ankara, Turkey; 2Hacettepe University, Faculty of Medicine, Dep of Psychiatry, Ankara, Turkey; 3Hacettepe University, Faculty of Medicine, Dep of Neurology, Ankara, Turkey\n\nCorrespondence: B. Uzay; H. Karatas\n\nCortical spreading depression(CSD) is the electro-physiological correlate of migraine aura that causes opening of pannexin-1 megachannels and ATP release.CSD triggers parenchymal neurogenic inflammation(PNI) preceding meningeal inflammation which is the cause of migraine headache.P2X7-receptors are purinergic receptors activating pro-inflammatory cascades when extracellular ATP increased.We aim to investigate the effects of purinergic P2X7-receptors on CSD-induced PNI using a potent, selective and BBB permeable P2X7 antagonist(JNJ-47965567). Experiments were performed on Thy1-ChR2 transgenic mice and CSD is optogenetically triggered via a 450nm laser source without craniotomy. In the experimental group 30mg/kg JNJ-47965567(or its vehicle) was intraperitoneally administered 15-min prior to CSD induction. After CSD, animals were perfused with 4% PFA, brains cryosectioned. Sections were immune-stained with NF-kappa B-p65 and P2X7, costained with S100b and/or NeuN; imaged with confocal microscope.In cortex and subcortical structures (thalamus, hypothalamus, striatum, hippocampus) following CSD, NF-kB-p65 is translocated to the nucleus of the astrocytes and P2X7 receptor signal is increased particularly in neurons.These effects of CSD, indicating PNI are all reversed by P2X7 antagonist. P2X7 receptors play a role in neurogenic inflammation in the cortex and subcortical structures following CSD.P2X7 receptors can be used as a target in the prophylaxis and treatment of migraine headache.\n\nAL039 Insights into the natural history of spontaneous intracranial hypotension from infusion testing\n\nJ. Beck1, C. Fung1, D. Cipriani1, T. Dobrocky2, A. Raabe3, E. I. Piechowiak2, L. Häni3\n\n1University of Freiburg, Germany, Neurosurgery, Freiburg, Germany; 2University of Bern, Neuroradiology, Bern, Switzerland; 3University of Bern, Neurosurgery, Bern, Switzerland\n\nCorrespondence: J. Beck\n\nObjective\n\nTo assess the pathophysiologic changes in spontaneous intracranial hypotension\n\n(SIH) based on measures of CSF dynamics and on the duration of symptoms.\n\nMethods: We included consecutive patients from 2012 to 2018. CSF leak was confirmed if extrathecal contrast spillage was seen on imaging after intrathecal contrast application, or dural breach was detected intraoperatively. We divided patients with a CSF leak into 3 groups depending on the symptom duration: ≤10, 11–52, and >52 weeks. Clinical characteristics and measures of CSF fluid dynamics obtained by computerized lumbar infusion testing (LIT) were analyzed over time.\n\nResults: Among the 137 patients included, 69 had a confirmed CSF leak. Whereas 93.1% with <10 weeks of symptoms displayed typical orthostatic headache, only 62.5% with >10 weeks of symptoms did (p = 0.004). LIT revealed differences between groups with different symptom duration for CSF outflow resistance (p < 0.001), lumbar baseline pressure (p = 0.013), lumbar plateau pressure (p < 0.001), pressure–volume index (p = 0.001), elastance (p < 0.001), and CSF production rate (p = 0.001). Compared to the reference population, only patients with acute symptoms showed a significantly altered CSF dynamics profile.\n\nConclusion: A CSF leak dramatically alters CSF dynamics in the acute phase of SIH, but these dynamics normalize with long lasting symptoms. There was an association between the clinical presentation and changes in CSF dynamics.\n\nAL040 IIH Pressure Med: A randomised, sequential, trial of the effect on intracranial pressure of five drugs commonly used in Idiopathic Intracranial Hypertension\n\nJ. Mitchell1, S. P. Mollan2, J. Walker1, H. Lyons1, A. Yiangou1, Z. Alimajstorovic1, O. Grech1, B. R. Wakerley3, G. Tsermoulas4, K. Brock5, A. J. Sinclair1\n\n1University of Birmingham, Metabolic Neurology, Birmingham, United Kingdom; 2University Hospitals Birmingham, Ophthalmology, Birmingham, United Kingdom; 3University Hospitals Birmingham, Neurology, Birmingham, United Kingdom; 4University Hospitals Birmingham, Neurosurgery, Birmingham, United Kingdom; 5University of Birmingham, Birmingham, United Kingdom\n\nCorrespondence: J. Mitchell\n\nBackground: Limited data exists to guide treatment of idiopathic intracranial hypertension (IIH). We examined the effects of therapeutics on reducing intracranial pressure (ICP) in IIH.\n\nMethods: Randomised, sequential, open label trial in women with active IIH. Participants received 2 weeks of acetazolamide (2g), amiloride (10mg), furosemide (80mg), spironolactone (200mg) and topiramate (100mg). Treatment order was randomised, minimum 1 week drug washout between rounds. ICP was recorded before and after with telemetric, intraparenchymal ICP monitors (Raumedic, Hembrechts, Germany). Headache frequency and severity were recorded by diary. Analysis was by hierarchical regression.\n\nResults: 14 participants were recruited. BMI 38.1(6.2) kg/m2, ICP 30.6(5.1) cmCSF at baseline. ICP fell significantly with 4 drugs acetazolamide mean -3.31mmHg(SE 0.95), p=0.0009, furosemide -3.03(0.88), 0.0011, spironolactone -2.71(0.88), 0.0033, topiramate -2.29(0.85), 0.0095. There was no significant difference between drugs. There was no significant improvement in headache. Side-effects were common with acetazolamide (92%) and topiramate (92%).\n\nConclusions: Acetazolamide, furosemide, spironolactone and topiramate marginally reduced ICP, but there was no statistical difference between treatments and no improvement in headache. There were significant side-effects, especially with acetazolamide and topiramate. Therapeutics with greater efficacy and less side effects are an unmet need in IIH.\n\nAL041 Characterizing Preventive Treatment Gaps in Migraine: Results From the CaMEO Study\n\nS. J. Nahas1, D. C. Buse2, S. Hutchinson3, M. L. Reed4, K. M. Fanning4, B. Dabruzzo5, R. B. Lipton2\n\n1Thomas Jefferson University, Jefferson Headache Center, Philadelphia, PA, United States; 2Albert Einstein College of Medicine, Bronx, NY, United States; 3Orange County Migraine and Headache Center, Irvine, CA, United States; 4Vedanta Research, Chapel Hill, NC, United States; 5AbbVie, Madison, NJ, United States\n\nCorrespondence: S. J. Nahas\n\nObjective: To characterize self-reported use of preventive medications for migraine and treatment gaps in a representative US sample.\n\nMethods: CaMEO was a web-based survey (Sept 2012-Nov 2013) of people who met modified migraine criteria consistent with International Classification of Headache Disorders, 3rd edition. Potentially preventive-eligible respondents for traditional oral preventive medications (≥4 monthly headache days [MHDs]) were categorized by oral preventive use status, and prespecified treatment gaps were characterized.\n\nResults: Among respondents with ≥4 MHDs, 80.2% (5275/6579) reported never using, 9.8% (642/6579) reported currently using, and 10.1% (662/6579) reported previous but not current use of a daily oral migraine preventive. Among never users, 61.8% (3259/5275) were interested in trying a daily oral prescription preventive. Among current users, 26.0% (167/642) reported that their preventive medication did not work at all, or only prevented a few attacks. Additionally, 85.7% (550/642) were somewhat/very interested in trying a different daily oral preventive medication. Among discontinued users, factors contributing to discontinuation included safety and tolerability concerns (44.6% [295/662]) and insufficient efficacy (34.8% [263/662]).\n\nConclusion: Less than 10% of potentially preventive-eligible respondents were currently using a migraine preventive. Discontinuations were largely attributed to safety and tolerability concerns, and lack of efficacy.\n\nAL042 Treatment with calcitonin gene-related peptide antibodies modifies brainstem excitability and habituation to nociceptive trigeminal stimulation in migraineurs\n\nA. Thiele1, L. Klehr1, S. Strauß1, A. Angermaier1, M. Kronenbuerger2, R. Fleischmann1\n\n1University Medicine Greifswald, Department of Neurology, Greifswald, Germany; 2Medical School OWL, Department of Neurology, Bielefeld, Germany\n\nCorrespondence: R. Fleischmann\n\nObjective: Calcitonin gene-related peptide ligand/receptor (CGRP) antibodies effectively reduce headache frequency in migraineurs. It is understood that they act peripherally, which raises the question whether treatment merely interferes with the last stage of headache generation or, alternatively, causes secondary adaptations in the central nervous system and is thus disease modifying.\n\nMethods: This interim analysis includes fifteen episodic migraineurs (14 female, 48±13 years old), who completed all study visits until March 2021 and received assessments of the nociceptive blink reflex (R2 component, 10 trials, 6 stimuli/trial) before (V0) and three months (V1) after treatment with CGRP antibodies started. The R2 area (R2a) and habituation (R2h; gradient of R2a against stimulus order) of the stimulated/non-stimulated side (_s/_ns) following repeated supraorbital stimulation provide a direct readout of brainstem excitability and habituation as key mechanisms in migraine.\n\nResults: All patients showed a substantial reduction of headache days/month (V0: 12.3±3.7, V1: 5.9±4.0) and disability (HIT-6, V0: 65.1±2.9, V1: 55.2±8.6). R2a significantly decreased (R2a_s: -46%, p=.038; R2a_ns: -39%, p=.014) and R2h significantly increased (R2h_s: β=-.33, p=.016; R2h_ns: β=-2.6, p=.041) from V0 to V1.\n\nConclusion: We provide novel evidence that treatment with CGRP antibodies is disease modifying. The nociceptive blink reflex may provide a biomarker to monitor central disease activity.\n\nAL043 Long-term Fremanezumab Treatment Over 6 to 12 Months Shows No Effect on Blood Pressure in Migraine Patients\n\nS.

Nahas3\n\n1Department of Neurology, Martin Luther University Halle, University Hospital Halle (Saale), Halle, Germany; 2Teva Branded Pharmaceutical Products R&D, Inc., West Chester, PA, United States; 3Thomas Jefferson University, Philadelphia, PA, United States\n\nCorrespondence: S. Nägel\n\nObjective: To assess long-term effects of fremanezumab on blood pressure (BP) in clinical trial participants (CTPs) from a 12-month (mo) long-term extension study (HALO LTS) and 6-mo study (FOCUS).\n\nMethods: In HALO LTS, CTPs received quarterly (QTY; 675mg) or monthly (MLY; 225mg) fremanezumab for 12 mo. In FOCUS, CTPs received QTY or MLY fremanezumab or placebo (PBO) for a 3-mo double-blind (DB) period; all CTPs received MLY fremanezumab during a subsequent 3-mo open-label (OL) extension. Adverse events (AEs) for BP changes and changes in systolic BP (SBP; in mmHg) and diastolic BP (DBP; in mmHg) over time (in CTPs with hypertension [HTN] or taking anti-HTN concomitant medications in HALO LTS) were evaluated.\n\nResults: In HALO LTS, AEs of increased DBP and decreased SBP were reported for 1 CTP each (QTY group). Mean BP values were comparable or lower during treatment than at baseline (BL) in CTPs with a history of HTN (SBP: BL, 128.2; end of treatment [EOT], 128.0; DBP: BL, 82.3; EOT, 81.6) and concomitant anti-HTN treatment (SBP: BL, 131.0; EOT, 128.6; DBP: BL, 84.0; EOT, 82.3). In FOCUS, 1 CTP (QTY group) had an AE of decreased BP during the DB period and 1 had increased BP during the OL extension. Overall, BP was maintained or decreased slightly during treatment (mean SBP: BL, 122.7; EOT, 122.7; mean DBP: BL, 78.6; EOT, 78.3).\n\nConclusion: With long-term fremanezumab treatment in HALO LTS and FOCUS, there were few BP-related AEs, and SBP and DBP changed minimally with treatment.\n\nAL044 Erenumab vs galcanezumab in a very difficult-to-treat migraine population. Efficacy and safety\n\nD. I. Samuel, C. Nieves Castellanos, L. L. Mireya, P. G. Julia, N. M. María José\n\nHospital Universitari i Politècnic La Fe, Headache Unit - Neurology, Valencia, Spain\n\nCorrespondence: D. I. Samuel\n\nObjective: To evaluate the efficacy and safety of erenumab (E) vs galcanezumab (G) as preventive treatments in a very difficult-to-treat migraine population.\n\nMethods: Post-authorization study, phase IV, no financial support. Prospective registry of patients using E or G since its approval in our centre. Measures of efficacy: MHD (migraine Headache Days), MtuD (Monthly triptan-use Days), MOH rates, VAS and PRO as MIDAS, HIT-6, PCS and MsQol are evaluated at baseline, and each 3 months. Adverse events are reported.\n\nResults: 220 patients reached at least 3 months. Age 47\"46 years, women 81\"55%, 89% Chronic Migraine, 15 years with CM. Have failed 5\"74 previous preventive treatments. Baseline: 20\"57 MHD, 17\"13 MtuD, 87\"73% MOH; MIDAS 93, HIT-6 68\"86, PCS 32\"74, MsQol 29\"2. 111 patients used E, 109 G. MHD with E at baseline, 3, 6 months: 20\"94, 17\"28, 10\"93; with G: 20\"19, 16\"28, 10\"83. Rest of measures will be presented and are very similar in treated with E or G, achieving the best improvements in MsQol and MOH rates. Adverse events: constipation the most reported, near 25% in both E and G treated patients.\n\nConclusion: Erenumab and galcanezumab are effective when used as preventive treatments in a very difficult-to-treat migraine population. Results are even better when measured in terms of Quality of Life. Constipation is the most usual adverse event, greater in real life than in clinical trials. The results of both are very similar in terms of efficacy and safety.\n\nAL045 Long term (48-weeks) effectiveness, safety and tolerability of erenumab in the prevention of high-frequency episodic and chronic migraine in real-world: the EARLY 2 study\n\nC.

Aurilia\n\nObjective: To assess the long-term effectiveness, safety and tolerability of erenumab in real-world.\n\nMethods: In 48-week, multicenter (n=15) longitudinal cohort real life study, all consecutive adult patients with high-frequency episodic migraine (HFEM) or chronic migraine (CM) received erenumab 70 mg monthly. Change in monthly migraine days (MMD) at weeks 45-48 compared to baseline was the primary efficacy endpoint. Secondary endpoints encompassed change in monthly analgesic intake (MAI), ≥50%, ≥75%, or 100% response rates, VAS and HIT-6 scores. Results: Of the 242 patients treated with >1 dose, 221 received erenumab for >48 weeks. Patients had >3 prior preventive treatments failures. Most subjects received 140 mg. From baseline to weeks 45-48, erenumab reduced MMD by 4.3 days in HFEM and 12.8 in CM. VAS and HIT-6 were decreased by 1.8 and 12.3 in HFEM, and 3.0 and 13.1 in CM. MAI passed from 11 to 5 in HFEM and from 20 to 6 in CM.>50% responders were 56.1% in HFEM and 75.6% in CM, >75% were 31.6% and 44.5%, and 100% responders 8.8% and 1.2% respectively. Erenumab was safe. Responsiveness predictors were allodynia (p=0.009) in HFEM and male gender (p=0.044) and baseline migraine frequency (p=0.001) in CM. Negative predictors in CM were psychiatric comorbidities (p=0.023) and prior treatment failures (p=0.004).\n\nConclusions: Long-term erenumab treatment provides sustained effectiveness, safety and tolerability in HFEM or CM patients with >3 prior preventive treatment failures.\n\nAL046 Chronic Migraine with Medication Overuse Headache: is detoxification still necessary in the era of new prophylaxes?\n\nD. Mascarella, E. Matteo, G. M. Asioli, U. Pensato, V. Favoni, G. Andrini, G. Pierangeli, S. Cevoli, P. Cortelli\n\nUniversity of Bologna, Bologna, Italy\n\nCorrespondence: D. Mascarella\n\nObjectives: To estimate the effectiveness of detoxification in multi-resistant chronic migraine (CM) with medication overuse headache (MOH) patients who start prophylaxes with Botulinum Toxin A(BTA) or Anti-CGRP mAb.\n\nMethod: Prospective analysis of all CM with MOH patients with at least 28 monthly headache days (MHD) who started a prophylaxis with either BTA or Anti-CGRP, with or without detoxification at the beginning of treatment, at Bologna Headache Center. We evaluated CM remission and MHD at three months.\n\nResults: 89 patients were included; 50 started BTA and 39 Anti-CGRP.\n\nIn the BTA group, 29 patients started prophylaxis immediately after detoxification (PAD) and 21 prophylaxis alone (PA). At 3-months, we observed conversion to episodic migraine in two (9.5%) of the 21 PA patients and in six (20.6%) of the 29 PAD patients (p 0.28). Mean MHD at three months were 26.9 in the PA group versus 22.7 in the PAD group (p 0.03)\n\nIn the Anti-CGRP group, 13 patients started PAD and 26 PA. At 3-months we observed clinical conversion to episodic migraine in five of the 26 PA patients (19.2%) and five of the 13 PAD (38.4%) (p 0.1). Mean MHD were 22.2 in the PA group and 16.3 in the PAD group (p 0.11)\n\nConclusion: Detoxification seems to maintain a key role in preventive treatment of CM patients with MOH, also in the era of new prophylaxes. Larger samples are warranted to obtain definitive results.\n\nAL047 Effectiveness of prophylactic and acute migraine treatment in rare migraine syndromes\n\nI. de Boer, Y. Su, A. Wilms, J. Simons, N. Pelzer, G. M. Terwindt\n\nLeiden University Medical Center, Neurology, Leiden, Netherlands\n\nCorrespondence: A. Wilms\n\nObjective: Rare migraine syndromes have provided insight into migraine mechanisms. Little is known on treating migraine in these disorders. Physicians seem reluctant to start triptans fearing (vascular) side-effects. We evaluated migraine treatment in Hemiplegic Migraine (HM), Cerebral Autosomal Dominant Arteriopathy with Subcortical Infarcts and Leukoencephalopathy (CADASIL) and Retinal Vasculopathy with Cerebral Leukoencephalopathy and Systemic manifestations (RVCL-S).\n\nMethods: A retrospective cohort study was performed in HM, CADASIL and RVCL-S patients diagnosed between 2009-2020. Treatment effectiveness and side-effects were assessed.\n\nResults: We included 77 HM (median follow up years (FUY):1 IQR 1-5), 114 CADASIL (FUY:1 IQR 0-3) and 28 RVCL-S (FUY:7 IQR 4-11) patients. Migraine prevalence was 53% in CADASIL and 43% in RVCL-S. Prophylactics were prescribed in 53 (69%) HM, 9 (15%) CADASIL, and 3 (25%) RVCL-S patients. In 80% of HM, 90% of CADASIL, and 66% of RVCL-S patients treatment was effective. Most effective prophylactics with the least side-effects for HM were: 1) lamotrigine, 2) valproate, 3) topiramate, 4) acetazolamide. Valproate appeared most effective in CADASIL. Acetazolamide and propranolol showed efficacy in RVCL-S. Triptans were used by 86 patients without severe side-effects.\n\nConclusion: Lamotrigine, valproate, acetazolamide and topiramate are effective in HM. Valproate seems effective for migraine in CADASIL. No severe side-effects of triptans were reported.\n\nAL048 Impact of Baseline Characteristics on the Efficacy and Safety of Eptinezumab in Patients With Migraine: Subgroup Analyses of PROMISE-1 and PROMISE-2\n\nV.

Cady\n\nObjective: To evaluate the efficacy of eptinezumab for migraine prevention across patient subgroups defined by patient self-reported intrinsic factors.\n\nMethods: PROMISE-1 and PROMISE-2 randomized adults with episodic and chronic migraine, respectively, to eptinezumab or placebo. Data from the studies were pooled, with clinical efficacy evaluated using the predefined ≥50% migraine responder rate (MRR) over weeks 1–12 endpoint. Intrinsic factors included select demographics, medical history, and migraine characteristics at baseline. No formal statistical testing was performed due to the post hoc nature of the analysis.\n\nResults: Demographics and baseline characteristics were balanced across the 100-mg, 300-mg, and placebo groups. Intrinsic factors defined by migraine characteristics (age at migraine diagnosis, duration of migraine diagnosis, baseline monthly headache days, and baseline MMDs) did not impact ≥50% MRRs with eptinezumab, with a similar efficacy profile across both dose levels. A dose-response trend was noted for eptinezumab 100 mg and 300 mg for gender (male), obesity (class I, class II), and race (nonwhite), with numerically higher ≥50% MRRs for 300 mg vs 100 mg. Intrinsic factors had no impact on safety outcomes, with no new safety signals identified.\n\nConclusion: This exploratory analysis found that eptinezumab demonstrated a clinical response (ie, ≥50% MRR vs placebo) across a wide range of demographic factors and disease characteristics at baseline.\n\nAL049 Consistent efficacy and safety of erenumab over time in patients with episodic migraine who completed a 5-year, open-label extension study\n\nM.

Ashina\n\nErenumab demonstrated significant reduction in migraine frequency in short-term studies. Here, we report the long-term efficacy and safety of erenumab in episodic migraine patients who completed a 5-year open-label treatment phase (OLTP; NCT01952574).\n\nFollowing a 12-week placebo-controlled, double-blind treatment period (DBTP), 383 patients continued into the OLTP, receiving erenumab 70mg every 4 weeks, and increasing to 140mg after a protocol amendment (after ~2 years in OLTP). Overall, 214 patients completed the 5-year OLTP; 138 patients had efficacy data at Week 268 (end of 5-year OLTP) and were included in this analysis.\n\nAt Week 268, the mean(SD) change from the DBTP baseline in monthly migraine days (MMD) and monthly acute migraine-specific medication (AMSM) days was −5.3(3.9) and −4.4(3.3), respectively. Other efficacy results are presented in Table 1. Exposure-adjusted patient incidence of adverse events (AEs) and serious AEs during OLTP was 91.6 and 2.8 per 100 subject-years, respectively; this was lower than that observed for erenumab 70mg during DBTP. One fatality occurred during the safety follow-up period when no erenumab was administered and was considered unrelated to study drug by the investigator.\n\nPatients receiving erenumab over 5-years demonstrated consistent and sustained response. Safety was comparable to that observed in patients who received erenumab 70mg during the randomised phase of the trial.\n\nAL050 Real-world healthcare costs and resource utilization (HRU) among patients treated with erenumab in the United States: A retrospective claims database study\n\nS.

J. Tepper\n\nObjective: To evaluate costs and HRU among migraine patients treated with erenumab in the US.\n\nMethods: Adults with ≥3 consecutive monthly claims for erenumab (11/01/2017–09/01/2019) were identified from the Komodo Health database (index date=first erenumab claim). Mean monthly migraine-related and all-cause healthcare costs ($2019) during 180 days pre-index were compared over varied follow-up periods to assess the short- (180 days post-index), mid- (91-270 days post-index), and longer-term (maximum available follow-up time) impact of the treatment. HRU was compared over 180 days pre- vs. 180 days post-index periods. Outcomes were adjusted for patient characteristics.\n\nResults: Overall, 1,839 patients were included (mean age 47 years; 86% females). Following erenumab initiation, a reduction in mean monthly migraine-related (P<0.0001) and all-cause medical costs (P=0.07) during the 180-day post-index period was observed, which was associated with significant increase in migraine-related (P<0.0001) and all-cause prescription costs (P<0.0001). However, with increase in follow-up time, up to 98% of the increased migraine-related and >100% of the all-cause prescription costs were offset by the reduced medical costs (Fig. 1). A significant reduction in HRU during the 180-day post-index period was observed (Table 1).\n\nConclusion: Erenumab treatment has an entrance cost that gets mitigated by reduced medical cost over a long-term follow-up suggesting an improved disease management.\n\nAL051 Efficacy of Fremanezumab in Migraine Patients With Pain or Psychiatric Comorbidities and Documented Inadequate Response to 2-4 Prior Migraine Preventive Medication Classes\n\nE.
