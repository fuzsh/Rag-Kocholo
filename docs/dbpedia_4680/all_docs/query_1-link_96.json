Topics discussed include identification of plant species using traditional and molecular-based methods; extracts from wild plants that possess antioxidant capacity; wild plant seed identification through image and linear discriminant analysis; the keystone tree species of Fagus sylvatica in the glacial refuge area of southern Europe and how dominant plant species influence the patterns of ecological interactions. Chapter 1 - Identification of experimental material is one of the most fundamental requirements of all areas of biological science. The discovery and naming of living organisms (any life form including plant, animal or microbe) has attracted a lot of attention throughout history. Identification is ‗the process of assigning a specimen to a (pre-existing) taxon‘. Plant species have been regarded as a basic unit of biodiversity and it is the level at which most of the evolutionary studies have focused. The need for plant species identification is both varied and widespread, and includes applications for plant breeding, agricultural seed industry, food processing, conservation biology, forensic analysis and many other aspects of plant science. Traditionally, identification of plant species has relied heavily on morphological characters. For the most part, however, vegetative traits are highly variable between individuals and often too plastic (plasticity: the deviation of the mean phenotype of a genotype (the sum total of the genes contained in the chromosomes of the eukaryotes) within an environment from the mean phenotype of that across all environments) to be used for identification at the species level. The value of floral features for diagnosis is constrained, however, by their absence from the plant during much of the year and unavailability of flowers in small plant species. There are many instances when the amount of material available is insufficient to enable identification using the traditional strategies. The use of molecular approaches for species identification, therefore, is the most attractive strategy. Genetic variation in plants has been reported at all taxonomic levels. This variation can be exploited for the identification of plants at all taxonomic ranks. The development of various molecular techniques that generate molecular markers has made it possible to accurately identify plants. These techniques either exploit differences at the level of the DNA or of the protein encoded by it. In this chapter, few of those techniques and traditional methods that can be used for identification plant species will be discussed, and examples of employing them for identification of plant species will be provided. Chapter 2 - Antioxidants have been classically employed in the food industry and elsewhere, mainly as preservatives. Further to this deed, antioxidants are nowadays\n\nWild Plants: Identification, Uses and Conservation : Identification, Uses and Conservation, edited by Ryan E.

Davis\n\nincreasingly sought as components of the diet owing to their benefits upon human health – via protection of cells against oxidative stress, which might otherwise lead to cell damage and death; coronary heart diseases, ulcers, cancers and neurogenerative diseases – besides overall ageing, are but a few examples of diseases and health conditions that can be prevented (or, at least, delayed) via regular and balanced ingestion of antioxidants. Antioxidants can be chemically synthesized, or else extracted from biological samples – especially from plants. Natural antioxidants have been in greater and greater demand, in response to a more environmentally-aware consumer population. The most abundant antioxidants in plants are polyphenols; deprived of nitrogen, these arenes substituted by hydroxyl groups possess more than one phenol ring, and are mainly generated via the shikimate or the acetate pathways. This chapter reviews the most important literature sources pertaining to wild plants from which extracts have been obtained that possess Chapter 3 - High biodiversity assures the ecosystems aptitude to adapt to environmental changes, guaranteeing ecological balance and future life. Unfortunately today, biological diversity faces many threats throughout the world and, as a consequence, the loss of wild plant biodiversity is constantly increasing. Extinction is the gravest aspect of the biodiversity crisis. It is irreversible. While extinction is a natural process, human impacts have elevated the rate of extinction by at least a thousand times than the natural rate. It was worked out that, in the last 100 years, human activity has caused between fifty and one thousand times more extinctions than would have happened due to natural processes. In order to spark off processes of conservation and preservation, the in situ and ex situ conservation concepts were introduced by the Convention on Biological Diversity (CBD), ratified in 1993 by European Union. In addition to preserve existing genetic resources, the conservation allows the study and the development of new cultivars during genetic improvement processes, it provides populations for reintroduction and repopulation programs of degraded habitats, and then it permits industry, agriculture and scientific research to use essential for future progress. Finally, the ex situ conservation allows to study the best strategies to apply at the in situ conservation of threatened species (Bacchetta, 2011a). All that is possible thanks to the activities of structures more and more widespread such as the germplasm banks, whose function is not only to preserve threatened species, but also to store, by long-term techniques, seeds, spore, woods, tissues and any other structures that make up the genetic biodiversity of the planet. Chapter 4 - Fagus sylvatica is a keystone species shaping the most important natural and quasi-natural ecosystems of the mountains in the Mediterranean area. This work has the aims to evaluate the genetic structure of beech in the southernmost distribution areas and map relevant sub-populations for conservation genetics. The methods used are based on landscape genetics. Landscape genetic maps were generated from 7 microsatellite loci using 37 subpopulations sampled in southern Italy and two control subpopulations from Norway and Sicily. Ecological sources of variation were also recorded and evaluated. Genetic disequilibrium increased from the sub-population to the whole population. The significant differentiation among sub-population for nuclear markers was consistent with the outcrossing breeding system. Two main clusters spatially distributed according to a contact zone migration model were inferred. Chloroplast haplotype richness decreased when moving northward and was independent of the sub-population sample size. Nuclear allelic richness was evenly distributed and correlated with both gene diversity (He) and sub-population size. Sub-populations bearing both a low heterozygote deficit and high chloroplast haplotype\n\nWild Plants: Identification, Uses and Conservation : Identification, Uses and Conservation, edited by Ryan E.

Southern Italy is not a homogeneous area in terms of beech genetic diversity. The assessed spatial genetic pattern can better direct both the beech-wood management design and the strategies of genetic conservation. Chapter 5 - Analysis of a dataset obtained from a monitoring programme at the Heron Wood Reserve (Scotland, UK), focuses on the differences in certain properties of soil and forest litter and patterns of ecosystem dynamics in plots dominated by differing vegetation types, especially the arborescent beech (Fagus sylvatica) and birch (Betula pendula x B. pubescens), and the grass Holcus lanatus. A number of properties show some considerable differences in relation to the habitats dominated by different plant species. For example, pH in the grassland and beech-dominated habitat was significantly lower than in the habitats dominated by birch and mixed vegetation. The highest soil ergosterol was found in the beechdominated habitat, and it was significantly different from grass and birch dominated habitats. By contrast, the numbers of forest floor layer bacteria in the beech-dominated plots were significantly lower than in the other habitats. Some remarkable differences have also been found as regards forest litter composition and moisture, the community saprotrophs and sheathing mycorrhizas. The ecological patterns are further complicated by animals, and are exemplified here by discussing the role of nutrient inputs due to the mammalian droppings characterised by a succession of the coprophilous mycota. The discussion concentrates on how the dominant plant species influence the patterns of ecological interactions observed. Chapter 6 - Sicily and its satellite islets host a rich vascular flora, including almost 3,000 native plant species and subspecies; in addition, due to its central position in the Mediterranean, the island has played and still plays a key-role in connecting both plant and human populations of neighbouring Mediterranean countries. The high plant biodiversity is due to a number of factors, such as geographical setting, geological history, soil-type diversity, bioclimatic variability and natural and human disturbance history. Among this flora, many plants, mostly herbs and sub-shrubs, have been used by local people since ancient times for various purposes, mainly as food and/or medicine. The long lasting history of exploitation, deeply permeated with the strong influence from external civilisations, has given rise to a rich inheritance of knowledge that indissolubly has bound biological and cultural (e.g. ethnic and/or linguistic) aspects, resulting in a remarkable bio-cultural diversity within the island territory. In the present chapter, we provide an updated list of Sicilian autochthonous edible plants, giving supplementary information on their vernacular names and uses, in addition to the eco-geography of some rare or endemic species. Emphasis is placed on some differences in plant naming and uses within the regional territory, probably due to different cultural influences, mostly deriving from Greek, Latin and Arab languages. Moreover, the local richness in wild relatives of food crops and the large number of foodmedicines among locally gathered plants is highlighted. The study allowed for the identification of more than 250 wild edible plants that are known through an unexpectedly vast number of vernacular plant names and used in many preparations. This suggests an extremely complex and intriguing history of exploitation, quite afar to be acquainted. Moreover, it could significantly contribute to the conservation and valorisation of the rich bio-cultural inheritance of Sicily. Chapter 7 - Wild plants, which are wild species closely related to cultivar, are a neglected global natural resource, yet they make a concrete contribution to global wealth creation and food security (Maxted et al. 2007). Identification, uses and conservation for wild plants are of\n\nWild Plants: Identification, Uses and Conservation : Identification, Uses and Conservation, edited by Ryan E.

The current rapidly development of bioinformatics, genomics, and molecular biology as well as conventional breeding methods provides useful means to mine the desirable genes in wild plants. Rice (Oryza sativa L.) is the most important human food crop in the world. As a model plant of cereal family, two rice genome sequence map have been generated (Goff et al., 2002; Yu et al., 2002). The genus Oryza consists of two cultivated rice (O. sativa and O. glaberrima) and 21 wild species (Khush, 1997; Vaughan et al., 2003). The wild rice species offer a largely untapped resource of agriculturally important genes that have the potential to solve many of the problems in rice production which we face today such as yield, drought and salt tolerance and disease and insect resistance. To unlock the genetic potential of wild rice a project entitled the ―Oryza Map Alignment Project‖ (OMAP) had been constructed to sequence 11 wild rice species comprise nine different genome types and include six diploid genomes (AA, BB, CC, EE, FF and GG) and four tetrapliod genomes (BBCC, CCDD, HHKK and HHJJ) (Wing et al. 2005). The project provides a research platform to study evolution, development, genome organization, polyploidy, domestication, gene regulatory networks and crop improvement. Therefore, in this charter, cultivated rice (Oryza sativa) and its wild relatives were used as a case for demonstration of identification, use and conservation of wild plants. Chapter 8 - Persian shallot (Allium hirtifolium Boiss.), a bulb producing plant from Alliaceae, is a wildly growing plant collected for its bulbs. Bulbs of Persian shallot, called \"Mooseer\" in Farsi, are oval, white skinned, usually of one and rarely of two main bulbs and are completely different from common shallot (Allium ascalonicum). Mooseer is a nutritive plant with special taste and its dried bulb slices are used as an additive to yogurt and also pickling mixtures. Its powder is used as a tasty additive or spice for foods in Iran. In addition, it has crucial medicinal effects; The mean dry matter of Mooseer was higher (36.71%) than other alliums except garlic. Mooseer was rich in Cu as well as Zn and Mn elements. Also, its linolenic acid (ω3) and linoleic acid (ω6) were higher than common shallot and onion. As some of the edible vegetable alliums such as mooseer are indigenous (native and endemic) to Iran, and do not exist in other parts of the world, their conservation is become imperative.\n\nWild Plants: Identification, Uses and Conservation : Identification, Uses and Conservation, edited by Ryan E.

Nova Science Publishers, Incorporated. All rights reserved.\n\nThere has been considerable debate over the formal definition of the terms systematics, phylogenetics, classification and taxonomy (e.g., De Queiroz and Donoghue, 1988). In Greek terminology, the word taxonomy means ‗putting in order‘ whereas systematics means ‗putting together‘. Accordingly, Stace (1989) and many others preferred to treat both terms synonymously. Stace (1989) defined taxonomy as ‗the study and description of the variation of organisms, the investigation of the causes and consequences of this variation, and the manipulation of the data obtained to produce a system of classification‘. However, only a few workers (e.g., Mason in 1950, cited in Sivarajan and Robson, 1991) have accepted the treatment of taxonomy as a term with a wider concept than systematics. Stuessy (1979), Small (1989), Winston (1999) and Kazlev (2002) took a different view and preferred to use systematics as the broad term describing the discipline (see Fig.1 for an example).\n\nFigure 1. Relationships among and within the three main aspects of systematics (after Stuessy, 1979).\n\nKazlev (2002) defined systematics as ‗the branch of biology that deals with classifying living beings: the diversity and interrelationships of living beings, both present day organisms (\"neontology\") and prehistoric ones (\"palaeontology\")‘, and divided the concept into three Wild Plants: Identification, Uses and Conservation : Identification, Uses and Conservation, edited by Ryan E. Davis, Nova Science Publishers,\n\nIdentification of Plant Species Using Traditional and Molecular-Based Methods\n\n3\n\nsubdisciplines; phylogenetics, taxonomy and classification. Taxonomy was defined as ‗the describing and naming new taxa‘. Although in practice the distinction between these two terms is not always sharp, in this chapter taxonomy will be adopted as a subdivision of the broader term systematics. Savolainen and Chase (2003) believe that plant systematics is one of the most active areas of biology because of marked progress in molecular phylogenetics during recent decades. The three main aspects associated with taxonomy, namely nomenclature, classification and identification are described below.\n\nCopyright © 2011. Nova Science Publishers, Incorporated. All rights reserved.\n\nNomenclature The discovery and naming of living organisms (any life form including plant, animal or microbe) has attracted a lot of attention throughout history. The term ‗Nomenclature‘ covers the system of naming organisms, through the construction, interpretation and application of the regulations that govern this system (Stace, 1989). The species rank forms only part of a hierarchy in which individuals that share characters in common are grouped together, with position in the hierarchy being set by the level of variability. The hierarchical level containing the least variability is assigned the lowest taxonomic rank; ‗form‘. Groups of forms are progressively amalgamated into broader associations at the next taxonomic rank in the sequence; variety, subspecies, species, genus, tribe, family, order, class, division and Kingdom (Stace, 1989). The species rank has particular importance in the hierarchy (Stuessy, 1990) and is the standard rank against which others are gauged. This importance is reflected in the highly regulated process of naming a new species (nomenclature), with the new names at the species rank requiring a description of phenotypic attributes in Latin, the designation of a type specimen (a reference individual belonging to the species) as well as the creation of a new binomial and authority. The type specimens of higher ranks relate back to that of a designated (type) species. Uniform and internationally acceptable principles for naming plants were drafted in a series of meetings of the International (Botanical) Congress and first released in a formal publication entitled International Code of Botanical Nomenclature (ICBN), whose rules were developed at the International Congress held in Cambridge (England) in 1930. These rules, however, were derived in turn from previous ones, the earliest of which emanated from the Paris Congress in 1867. Names were needed to avoid descriptive phrases to refer to organisms and facilitate communications (Sivarajan and Robson, 1991). For example, in 1738, Linnaeus named a species ‗Plantago foliis ovatis glabris‘. When the number of plant species increased, however, this phrase became insufficient for the definite recognition of the taxon. So in 1753, Linnaeus named it as ‗Plantago foliis ovatis glabris, undo scapo tereti, spica flosculis imbricate’. Such names proved unpractical, therefore from 1753 Linnaeus used the binomial (binary) system of nomenclature, and for the Plantago species he gave Plantago major (Stace, 1989). Usually, the names assigned to plants are either Latin or from some other language and then ‗Latinised‘. In text, names are written in italics for the purpose of clarity and normally should be accompanied by the authority (not italicised) (e.g., Tritcum aestivum L.). The inclusion of authority avoids ambiguity as can occur when two or more species have been given the same name (only one of which, generally the earliest, is valid). For example, there\n\nWild Plants: Identification, Uses and Conservation : Identification, Uses and Conservation, edited by Ryan E. Davis, Nova Science Publishers,\n\n4\n\nNadia Haider\n\nare two concepts of Festuca glauca: the valid name described by Villars (F. glauca Vill.) and that described by Lamarck (F. glauca Lam.). The scientific name of a species always consists of two parts (binomial phrase); the first is the generic name (usually singular and starting with a capital letter), and the second is the species epithet (starting with a small letter). The latter can be one of the following: 1) an adjective that agrees with the generic name, and that refers to a distinguishing character of the species or to its origin (e.g., Rosa alba and Ulmus americana), 2) a noun is an apposition that agrees with the generic name but not necessarily agreeing with it in gender (as in Pyrus malus), 3) a noun in the genitive singular or plural such as when a species is named in honour of one or more persons (as in Carex davisii that named for a Mr. Davis), and 4) a common name in the genitive plural; this usually describes some thing about the species habitat (as in Carex paludosum meaning ―of the swamps‖) (Porter, 1967). Some of the names are made up of a random combination of letters as long as they can be pronounceable. This is the case in groups that are composed of a large number of species (Winston, 1999). According to the latter, name must be more than one letter long and cannot contain any diacritical marks.\n\nCopyright © 2011. Nova Science Publishers, Incorporated.

However, as an object, he defined classification as ‗that system itself, of which there are many sorts‘. Most systems of classification group species into a hierarchical series of successively larger groups (ranks) that culminate with a single group that includes all plants. The ICBN recognizes 12 main ranks in the hierarchy with the Kingdom as the largest one and the form as the smallest (Fig. 2). This number can be doubled by the addition of subcategories below each rank (e.g., subdivision).\n\nFigure 2. Ranks of the classification hierarchy recognised by the ICBN.

Early recognition of groups at that time was mainly based on their gross morphological similarities and dissimilarities. This is called ‗folk systematics‘ and these provide classifications that arise in both primitive and civilised communities through need and without the influence of science. The fundamental taxa recognised in folk systematics may often but not always correspond with species described scientifically (Berlin, 1973). The introduction of printing into Europe allowed the production of the ‗herbals‘ that were concerned with the classification of plants that are valuable to mankind either as food or medicines. Ancient Greeks were the first people to provide a written record of plant classifications in the form of herbals, such as the Codex of Dioscorides introduced in the middle ages. Many other early herbals were discovered and improved by taxonomists of Europe during that period (Porter, 1967). During the transition period of taxonomy, geographical exploration led to the discovery of new species and genera. Therefore, botanists developed a new system of classification that was regarded as ‗artificial‘ because it was developed primarily for the ease of identification regardless of evolutionary origin or genetic relationships (Porter, 1967). During this period, the founder of modern taxonomy, Carolus Linnaeus (1707-1778) classified large numbers of both animals and plants according to their reproductive morphology. He described this as the ‗Sexual System‘ of classification and was constructed entirely for the purpose of identification. Although the system was highly arbitrary (Sivarajan and Robson, 1991), its clear utility and simplicity meant that it rapidly gained widespread popularity. A major drawback of Linnaeus‘s sexual system of classification was that it lacked ‗predictive value‘; with obviously different species sometimes being grouped together whilst similar sister species could equally be separated. For instance, the genera Salvia, Anthoxanthum and Circaea were grouped into one class (Diandria) since they all have only two stamens. At present, however, these genera are placed in separate families (Lamiaceae, Poaceae and Onagraceae, respectively), the remainder of each of these modern families appeared in separate classes (Octandria, Didynamia and Ttriandria). In spite of these limitations, two works Linnaeus produced using the system Genera plantarum and Species Plantarum have proved to be of seminal scientific importance. Adanson (1727-1806) first proposed the idea that a great number of characters covering all aspects of plants should be used equally in classification. In this way, groups of organisms are established on the basis of their overall similarity to each other. This ethos is known as the ‗phenetic‘ system of classification. Wide ranges of sources of data are used when compiling such classification systems, which typically include information from plant structure and anatomy, cytology, morphology, genetics and biochemistry. However, it soon became apparent that there are many problems associated with the estimation of phenetic relationships. The incongruence between classifications based on different organs or life history stages proved particularly germane, as were the observation that different classifications may result from using different clustering methods. The landmark work of Charles Darwin in 1859 entitled ‗The origin of species‘ has stimulated many publications aimed at establishing the relationships between organisms on the basis of their evolutionary relationships. Interestingly, his theory of evolution did not have an immediate impact on plant classification strategies used and only gradually emerged as the\n\nWild Plants: Identification, Uses and Conservation : Identification, Uses and Conservation, edited by Ryan E. Davis, Nova Science Publishers,\n\nCopyright © 2011. Nova Science Publishers, Incorporated. All rights reserved.\n\n6\n\nNadia Haider\n\npredominant method of classification (Stuessy, 1990). Classifications based on shared evolutionary pathways are known as ‗phylogenetic‘ (phyletic) classifications, a concept that was founded by Hennig (1966). In contrast to the artificial classification systems aimed at enhancing identification, phylogenetic classifications are considered ‗natural‘ since it primarily reflects the phylogeny (evolutionary history and relationships of a group of taxa) of the plant (Porter, 1967). Intriguingly, there is no particular taxonomic method implied in this system. Currently, cladistics is the most popular paradigm of phylogenetic classification in biological taxonomy and has become widely accepted as the primary means for describing evolutionary relationships. Kitching et al. (1998) define cladistics as ‗a method of classification that groups taxa hierarchally into discrete sets and subsets‘. The authors believe that this system of classification can be used for the organisation of any kind of comparative data (e.g., linguistics) but it has been implied primarily in the field of biological systematics. This form of phylogenetic classification (i.e., cladistics) does imply a specific methodology or approach in deriving and constructing the classification. The system of cladistics is usually represented by the branching patterns of a family tree forming evolutionary clades (a single phylogenetic lineage) produced by ancestor-descendent divergent speciation (Morrison, 1993). According to Kitching et al. (1998), the primary aim of cladistic analysis is the establishment of relationships between sister groups (share common direct ancestor). The authors also reported that the principles of cladistics were developed by Willi Hennig in 1950, but it was not until 1966 that his work began to reach a lot of biologists. Some of the basic principles of cladistic theory proposed by Hennig are: 1) relationships are clearly defined in terms of common ancestry, 2) relationships are determined by shared derived characters, 3) cladogram (unrooted tree) is the branching diagram that express relationships and character distribution. Cladogram does not, however, imply ancestry and descent relationships. Evolutionary trees that are usually constructed from cladograms do so employing a time axis. Several trees may be compatible with one cladogram. Weighting characters to be included in the cladogram are aimed to improve the chances of getting a closer estimate to the true cladistic relationships using those characters (Sneath and Sokal, 1973). The three approaches of classification mentioned above can be used alone or in combination.\n\nIDENTIFICATION OF PLANT SPECIES Identification of experimental material is one of the most fundamental requirements of all areas of biological science. According to Dallwitz (1992), identification is ‗the process of assigning a specimen to a (pre-existing) taxon‘. Winston (1999) defined identification as ‗refereeing a species to a previously classified and named group‘. The author argued that many biologists are confused between the description and diagnosis of a species. He pointed out that diagnosis differs from description in that the latter has no clear or definite limit of characters that can be used to establish it, whereas the diagnosis includes just those characters that are needed to distinguish one species from all others. Hence, diagnosis of a species can be regarded as a part of its description.\n\nWild Plants: Identification, Uses and Conservation : Identification, Uses and Conservation, edited by Ryan E. Davis, Nova Science Publishers,\n\nCopyright © 2011. Nova Science Publishers, Incorporated. All rights reserved.\n\nIdentification of Plant Species Using Traditional and Molecular-Based Methods\n\n7\n\nFor diagnostic purposes, species can be considered as groups of individuals that are organised into populations and that share a combination of diagnostic characters not found outside the group. A full description of such characters is an integral part of the process of naming a new species. In practice, a character is any feature of an organism that can be measured, counted or assessed (Sivarajan and Robson, 1991) and typically includes morphological and anatomical traits but may also encompass biochemical, physiological and cytological features. The manner in which a feature varies between organisms can be broadly categorised into two main classes; qualitative and quantitative. Characters exhibiting qualitative variation show an abrupt change of phenotype among groups of individuals. For instance, members of the species Festuca vivipara L. can be distinguished from other species of the genus, Festuca L. by the presence of adventitious bulbils in the place of floral parts. Clear qualitative differences like this have great value for diagnostic purposes and so are favoured for identification whenever they are available. The majority of characters, however, show a more continuous pattern of variation and so differences between groups are more a matter of degree. These traits are said to show a quantitative pattern of variation. Their use generally requires either careful measurement or counting. Members of the species Festuca brevipila Tracey, for example, possess awns in the range 1.4-2.5 mm compared to those of F. lemanii (Bastard) that have shorter awns of only 0.3-1.8 mm (Wilkinson and Stace, 1989). The two also differ slightly in the number of adaxial leaf furrows, with 4-6 in the former and 2-4 in the latter. In this case, the character has only limited use for diagnosis. Clearly therefore, not all characters are equally informative; good characters are deemed as those that do not exhibit wide variation within the target group and yet are highly correlated with the group (Sivarajan and Robson, 1991). The most useful characters for species diagnosis are those that remain constant within the species, but differ between species (Winston, 1999). Such traits should also be quick and easy to record. Two sources of information have been generally utilized for this purpose; gross morphological features and anatomical traits. Other sources of such information include pollen characters, chromosome characteristics and phytochemical characters.\n\nMorphological Characters Traditionally, species identification has relied heavily on morphological characters (Rout et al., 2003). For example, Wagner (1996) found that the main morphological characters that can be considered to discriminate between wild and cultivated apple are the hairiness of inferior leaf surfaces, presence of thorns on twigs and form, colour and taste of the fruits. Similarly, Riaz et al. (2007) used different morphological characteristics (flowers, leaves, rose hips and plant length) for characterisation of plants that belong to two wild Rosa species (Rosa webbiana and R. brunonii). In 2008, Blas et al. selected 28 discriminant morphological characters to identify the wild Arracacia species from Peru. Among morphological characters, however, vegetative characteristics have been used only sparingly for the discrimination of species of angiosperm. For example, Morris et al. (1996) concluded that the occurrence of the Dendrobiinae species across a range of ecological situations is broadly reflected by the variability in their vegetative features. In this instance, features of the leaf have value for species diagnosis. The shape and length of non-\n\nWild Plants: Identification, Uses and Conservation : Identification, Uses and Conservation, edited by Ryan E. Davis, Nova Science Publishers,\n\nCopyright © 2011. Nova Science Publishers, Incorporated. All rights reserved.\n\n8\n\nNadia Haider\n\nglandular hairs have been also proved useful in identifying crude drugs from genus Leonurus (Chao et al., 1999). For the most part, however, vegetative traits are highly variable between individuals and often too plastic (plasticity: the deviation of the mean phenotype of a genotype (the sum total of the genes contained in the chromosomes of the eukaryotes) within an environment from the mean phenotype of that across all environments) to be used for identification at the species level. Barp et al. (2006) reported that leaf morphology may vary considerably even within a branch of Passiflora suberosa plants. Very recently, López et al. (2010) also belive that foliar plasticity in response to ontogeny, location within the plant and environmental changes is widespread among long-lived organisms. The variability of floral characters, and associated features like fruits and seeds, is in stark contrast to this. Flowers often lack variation in the basic structure between members of the same species, but frequently vary between species. It is for this reason that the floral parts are the most widely used for species identification purposes in Floras (e.g., Poaceae, Ranunculaceae, Asteraceae etc.). The value of floral features for diagnosis is constrained, however, by their absence from the plant during much of the year and unavailability of flowers in small plant species (e.g,. mosses and algae). The problem is made greater in plant groups that lack useful variability in the non-sexual parts. The lack of informative morphological characters outside the flowering period is particularly acute in higher plant families such as the Poaceae and Juncaceae, and also in larger groupings of the lower plants, including mosses and pteridophytes. The fact that aspects of plant phenotype can be affected by changes in the environment can also cause problems for identification purposes. For instance, Wissemann (2000) reported continuous and wide variance in the genus Rosa for many morphological characters. The author postulated that this variation is heavily influenced by environmental fluctuations and so can be attributed to phenotypic plasticity (the ratio of plastic variance to total phenotypic variance; flexibility). Similarly, Szczepaniak et al. (2002) noted that the excessive plasticity of diagnostic morphological characters considerably blurs the boundaries between subspecies of Elymus repens (L.) Gould (Poaceae). Conklin et al. (2009) also reported that the paucity of diagnostic morphological characters for identification and high morphological plasticity within the genera Eucheuma and Kappaphycus has led to confusion about the distributions and spread of three introduced eucheumoid species in Hawaii.\n\nAnatomical Characters The absence of reliable vegetative features in many plant groups creates the need for an alternative source of reliable and persistent characters. This need led to the examination of anatomical features (the internal form and structure of plant organs), particularly those of the vegetative organs. According to Stuessy (1990), the use of such features for the purpose of plant identification dates back to Bureau (in 1864). There are many sources of anatomical characters that have been used for diagnosis, including leaf and root sections (Hussin and Sani, 1998; Morris et al., 1996), leaf or stem epidermal structures (Davis and Barnett, 1997) and wood anatomy (Archer and Vanwyk, 1993; Callado and Costa, 1997). Of these, leaves are regarded as the most anatomically varied organs among angiosperms (cited in Stuessy, 1990). In a study carried out by Appezzato-da-Gloria et al. (1997), the foliar anatomy of five species of Aristolochia (Aristolochiaceae) proved useful for their diagnosis, and the authors\n\nWild Plants: Identification, Uses and Conservation : Identification, Uses and Conservation, edited by Ryan E. Davis, Nova Science Publishers,\n\nCopyright © 2011. Nova Science Publishers, Incorporated. All rights reserved.\n\nIdentification of Plant Species Using Traditional and Molecular-Based Methods\n\n9\n\nproposed an artificial key for the identification of these species based on diagnostic characters analysed. Anackov et al. (2008) also observed clear distinction in the leaf anatomy between the Salvia species (Salvia bertolonii Vis. and Salvia pratensis L. (Sect. Plethiosphace, Lamiaceae) they investigated. To distinguish 11 species of Paris collected from the western Sichuan province of China, Xue et al. (2009) systematically described and illustrated their microscopic features. The differences found among species analysed were great enough that the identity of most material could be easily determined. The key limitation restricting the usefulness of anatomical features lies in the need for a relatively high magnification to observe most features (excluding some trichome features) and the tendency for some traits to vary with developmental age. Anatomical features can also be sensitive to environmental change. For instance, Ramesarfortner et al. (1995) examined phenotypic plasticity in several anatomical features of leaves that were previously thought to differ diagnostically between four species of arctic Festuca (F. baffinensis, F. brachyphylla, F. edlundiae and F. hyperborean). The authors found that when these four species were subjected to the same conditions of temperature and water treatments, all produced leaves with similar anatomical structures. They concluded that most of the anatomical differences between these species largely represent a component of plasticity rather than species-specific adaptations. Accordingly, the authors indicated that anatomical features should be used with caution for the purposes of identification. Davis and Barnett (1997) confirmed that when they observed that stomatal number and distribution in species belonging to the genus Galanthus L. (Amaryllidaceae J. St.-Hil.) is at least partially controlled by environmental factors and the stage of growth. In another study, the leaf anatomy of plants growing in three different habitats (a dry site in the Antarctic tundra, a wet site in a zone exposed to sea spray and a greenhouse) were investigated by Wanowska et al. (2005). The authors found that the anatomical features of the leaf of Deschampsia antarctica (Poaceae) change under stress conditions. In a very recent study, López, et al. (2010) compared contrasted populations of Pinus canariensis grown in five sites inside and outside the natural distribution area of the species in order to quantify the phenotypic variation in needle morphology and anatomy in response to a climate gradient. Results revealed that most needle and growth traits were strongly affected by site.\n\nPollen Characters Species-specific pollen patterns are established early in meiosis (Sheldon and Dickinson, 1983). Basic differences in pollen structure (such as shape, size, exine sculpturing and number of germinal pores) are correlated with the mode of pollination in a particular plant group, and have a strong tendency towards consistency within that group. For this reason, pollen has long been viewed as having value for species identification purposes. According to Stuessy (1990), the first attempt to use pollen features for taxon diagnosis was carried out by the Englishman, John Lindley (1799-1865). A considerable overlap in mean and maximum pollen diameter as well as in a value called the axis/pore ratio (long axis length divided by the diameter of the pore present on the grains) occurs between teosinte and maize (cited in Holst et al., 2007).\n\nWild Plants: Identification, Uses and Conservation : Identification, Uses and Conservation, edited by Ryan E. Davis, Nova Science Publishers,\n\nCopyright © 2011. Nova Science Publishers, Incorporated. All rights reserved.\n\n10\n\nNadia Haider\n\nThe diagnostic information offered by pollen grains proved to be valuable at many taxonomic ranks. For instance, Szibor et al. (1998) believe that because pollen wall patterns are also so diverse and often so characteristic of each species, they have long been used for taxonomic classification and even for forensic identifications. Dessein et al. (2002) also showed that several pollen characteristics (size, aperture morphology and tectum peculiarities) have value for identification of species belonging to the genus Spermacoce (Rubiaceae). The seven species of Chrysanthemum examined by Meo and Khan (2006) using light and scanning electron microscopy revealed that there is a great range of variation of pollen size of potential taxonomic value for identification and delimitation of species within the genus. The same study demonstrated the potential of pollen studies in distinguishing some taxonomic groups in Anthemideae. Pollen morphology has also been investigated in three wild medicinal plant species [Fagonia cretica L. (Zygophyllaceae); Peganum harmala L. (Peganaceae) and Scorzonera undulata Vahl (Asteraceae)] growing in Egypt (Abdel-Hafez and El Naggar, 2006). Even at the genus level, Holst et al. (2007) listed several studies that were able to differentiate between Zea and the closely related genus Tripsacum, when Tripsacum pollen was found to be smaller. Stuessy (1990), however, argued that caution must be exercised when features of pollen structure are used for taxon discrimination since the chemical processing of these grains and nutritional factors may alter pollen size. Beyers and Marais (1998) attributed the polymorphism in pollen size between three species of the genus Lachnaea (Thymelaeaceae) to temporary ecological conditions. These observations led the authors to conclude that palynological characters have no diagnostic value for the discrimination of species they targeted. Holst et al. (2007) examined the promise, potential importance and pitfalls of distinguishing teosinte, maize and the closest wild relatives of the genus Zea, members of the genus Tripsacum, by using pollen, starch grain and phytolith analysis. Starch grains and phytoliths were revealed to be more useful than pollen in discriminating wild from domesticated maize.\n\nChromosomes Characteristics The first decades of the 20th century witnessed a shift from descriptive methods for plant identification to experimental strategies. Chromosomes contain the genetic material responsible for maintaining reproductive barriers and the integrity of species and other taxa. They were reported to be the most useful for diagnosis at the specific level due to their close relationship with reproductive factors. In this regard, it is worth noting that all lower plants are haploids and/or diploids (possess two copies of the basic chromosome number), whereas higher plants include diploids, polyploids (with more than two copies of the chromosome basic number; constituting 30-70% of angiosperms) and aneuploids (vary in single or few chromosomes only) as well as haploids in some species. Interspecifc chromosomal variations have been reported in the genus Mikania (Ruas and Ruas, 1987; Ruas and Aguiar-Perecin, 1997). Among characteristics of chromosomes, the most widely used for the diagnosis of species are: 1) the chromosome number (in somatic cells, denoted 2n or in meiocytes, denoted n) and 2) chromosome structure (Karyology). For instance, Bayly et al. (2000) used chromosome\n\nWild Plants: Identification, Uses and Conservation : Identification, Uses and Conservation, edited by Ryan E. Davis, Nova Science Publishers,\n\nCopyright © 2011. Nova Science Publishers, Incorporated. All rights reserved.\n\nIdentification of Plant Species Using Traditional and Molecular-Based Methods\n\n11\n\nnumber as a key feature to differentiate Hebe parviflora from H. stenophylla (the former is tetraploid and the latter is diploid). In many cases, however, polyploidy can arise spontaneously and have no taxonomic or diagnostic value. For example, the haploid and the diploid races of Pellia epiphylla are rarely separated taxonomically (Stace, 1989) neither are diploid and tetraploid cytotypes (populations or infraspecific taxa having different chromosome number or morphology) of Avena strigosa Schreb. (2n=14, 28) (Stace, 1997). Chromosome number can also vary in a less discrete fashion. For instance, Poa pratensis L. has chromosome numbers varying from 50-124, and Clytonia virginica (Portulacaceae) has chromosome number varying between 12 and 72 (Lewis, 1970). Other chromosome features such as chromosome behaviour during meiosis, DNA content and chromosomes banding pattern can be useful in plant identification. In 1926, Delaunay introduced the concept of ‗karyotype‘ and defined it as ‗a group of individuals resembling each other in the number, size and form of their chromosomes‘. A karyotype describes the phenotypic aspects of the chromosome complement of a species in terms of number, size, arm ratio (or centromere position), and other landmark features of its chromosomes. It has been revealed that the basic chromosome number is of importance to determine the systematic position of a taxon at high taxonomic levels (Raven, 1975). This was confirmed by Ghanbari et al. (online reference) when they found that the chromosome counts in the genus Rosa (Rosaceae) was various and useful in its taxonomy. The speciation in this genus is also believed to be accompanied by variation in chromosome size (Creomonini et al., 1993). Karyotypes are dynamic structures evolving through numerical and structural changes (for a comprehensive overview on chromosomal changes in plants, see Levin, 2002). Pimenov et al. (2003) reviewed the karyotype formulae of some 300 Apioideae species. It was noted by Fregonezi et al. (2004) that the presence of chromosomal markers in cultivated and wild species of the family Asteraceae has contributed to understanding the karyotypic organization and has also provided useful information for taxonomic applications. The characters of karyotype have been accepted to be fairly constant and species-specific, and have been used, therefore, as a molecular marker in plant identification. Indeed, the number, size and arm ratio of chromosome complements may differ even between closely related taxa (Iovene et al., 2008). In 2008, Mandáková and Lysak studied karyotype evolution in x=7 crucifer species (Brassicaceae) using comparative chromosome painting (CCP). Iovene et al. (2008) believe that although several karyotypes of leading Apioideae crops such as carrot, celery and coriander have been published, the karyological data of the wild relatives of these crop species (including wild Daucus species), however, are scarce or nonexistent. They also mentioned that genome studies at the chromosome level in both Daucus and its family have been based primarily on chromosome counts and morphology. Based on chromosome measurement and FISH-based chromosome landmarks, the authors compared and grouped karyotypes of Daucus species using numerical taxonomy approaches. However, they reported that \"a serious weakness of karyotype analysis is the paucity of chromosome markers, which has limited the identification of the chromosomal changes responsible for the extant karyotypes\". They also stated that this shortcoming can be overcome using two other main strategies in order to track the evolutionary events that led to the present karyotypes. These are comparative genetic mapping and cross-species or comparative chromosome painting. For example, based on a comparative RFLP map of a wild rice, O. officinalis and O. sativa, comparative analyses of karyotypes of O. officinalis were\n\nWild Plants: Identification, Uses and Conservation : Identification, Uses and Conservation, edited by Ryan E. Davis, Nova Science Publishers,\n\n12\n\nNadia Haider\n\ndemonstrated firstly by fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH) using a BAC clone and an RFLP marker from O. sativa as probes (Hong et al., 2009). A similar karyotype, however, does not always indicate affinity. For instance, Rheo discolor has an extremely variable karyotype (Darlington, 1937) as does Elymus striatulus (Gramineae) (Heneen and Runemark, 1972). For these reasons, coupled with the skill and time requirement to record cytological features, the latter generally have little utility for species diagnosis. The sole exception lies in the use of flow cytometry for the distinction of closely related species with different ploidy levels. For example, Wilkinson et al. (2000) used flow cytometry to differentiate between Brassica rapa (2n=20) and B. napus (2n=38). Karyotype evolution in species with identical chromosome number but belonging to distinct phylogenetic clades is a long-standing question of plant biology (Mandáková and Lysak, 2008). Karyotype analysis is also useful in understanding phylogenetical relationships, but before this can be attempted it is necessary to have a clear picture of the basic karyotype of all species of interest (Simak, 1966). Added to that, a better understanding of the genomic relationships of species in a genus will aid valuable conservation and efficient utilization of plant genetic resources. Therefore, Lee and Chung (2008) investigated the genomic relationships among the species of Paphiopedilum by FISH using both total genomic DNA (GISH) and 45S ribosomal RNA genes (rDNA) as probes. More recently, the karyotypes of four South American species of Cestrum (C. capsulare, C. corymbosum, C. laevigatum and C. megalophylum) were studied using conventional staining, C-CMA/DAPI chromosome banding and FISH with 45S and 5S rDNA probes (Fernandes et al., 2009). The authors believe that such information is useful in evolutionary studies of this group and allows the development of new directions in the elucidation of karyotype differentiation in Cestrum.\n\nCopyright © 2011.

Phytochemical data belong to two main types; micromolecular and macromolecular (proteins and nucleic acids, discussed later). The development of new analytical techniques simplified and accelerated the process of plant identification based on differential phytochemical profiles (Alston, 1967). However, the earliest comparative studies of plant chemistry were those of Abott, who examined the distribution of saponin in plants in 1886 (cited in Stuessy, 1990). Phytochemical information has proved useful for the differentiation of plants at all levels of the taxonomic hierarchy. Advantages of using different chemical profiles in different species lie in the consistency of some compounds within species, ease of assay and unambiguity in scoring. Tofern et al. (1999) used lolines for the diagnosis of several grass species. These chemicals are only known from certain grass genera (e.g., Festuca) and the genus Adenocarpus (Fabaceae). NFormylloline (loline alkaloid), that was detected in the roots and aerial vegetative parts of Argyreia mollis, was shown to be diagnostic for this species within this genus and 14 other Convolvulaceae genera. In 2002, Binns et al. determined quantitative phytochemical variation from roots and inflorescences of native plant populations in the genus Echinacea. The authors concluded that baseline phytochemical data and chromatographic profiles for all types of wild Echinacea may be used for germplasm identification, protection of wild stands and crop\n\nWild Plants: Identification, Uses and Conservation : Identification, Uses and Conservation, edited by Ryan E.

Generally, the need for specialist equipment and knowledge, the protracted time requirement for analysis and sensitivity of phytochemical profiles to environmental influences mean that the discipline has relative little utility for routine or large-scale species identification. As discussed above, there are usually several characters that can prove valuable for the discrimination of similar plant species. The number of characters and character states required for diagnosis increases as the number of possible identification outcomes increases. In cases where there are many species to be distinguished, therefore, there is a need to organise character state comparisons in such a way that diagnosis is achieved with a high level of accuracy and minimum effort. This process can be effected in several ways as outlined below.\n\nEarly Methods of Species Diagnosis Expert determination was perhaps the most widely used of the early strategies implied for species identification and is still in use today. Contemporary experts on the diagnosis of plant species usually specialise on a limited number of plant groups. This means that there are relatively few experts for any group in any one geographic area. It follows that the key limitation in the use of experts for diagnosis lies in their limited availability. For this reason, most experts prepare detailed treatments of their study group including monographs, revisions and synopses in order to facilitate diagnosis. It is usual for these works to contain extensive descriptions of all taxa covered. A similarly descriptive approach for identification is contained in the many Floras that are available for all parts of the world. In spite of the great reliability that extensive descriptions offer in terms of accuracy of diagnosis, it nevertheless presents problems by requiring either the valuable time of experts or painstaking comparisons of extensive lists of character states. The problem is worse, when there are no experts or associated monographs available for a certain taxa of plants, or when characters or parts of the plants expert need to make their determination are lacking from the material in question. Another traditional approach of identification is the recognition approach. According to Morse (1971), this approach is based on the extensive past experience of the identifier of a plant group with that group. However, such identifiers are not available for all groups of plants and hence, this approach will have no value for the diagnosis of a wide range of plant groups. A third method is to identify plants by the comparison of an unknown plant with named specimens, photographs, illustrations or descriptions. Although this approach has been found useful for many plant groups, its reliability is controlled by the accuracy and authenticity of the specimens, illustrations or descriptions used. Moreover, it cannot be applied sometimes due to the lack of suitable materials for comparison or the unavailability of all characters or parts of the plant in question required for complete and informative comparison. Even when such materials and characters are available, it is a very time consuming procedure. The limitations in these holistic approaches for identification gave rise to the need for a more structured approach for the comparison of character traits in different species.\n\nWild Plants: Identification, Uses and Conservation : Identification, Uses and Conservation, edited by Ryan E.

These include the fact that the many characters included are not ranked to indicate their value for diagnosis. Hence, many redundant characters are included that have no diagnostic value for any particular pairwise comparison. This can cause confusion and may lead the reader towards misdiagnosis, especially where some useful characters are unavailable (e.g., because of season). A second major constraint lies in the time required to effect comparisons between all character traits across all possible species. In cases where there are large numbers of possibilities, this need can render identification an impractical prospect. The imposition of structure and ranking of characters that are compared in order to reach a diagnosis can overcome many of these drawbacks. This process can be completed most effectively through the construction of diagnosis keys. The need for keys is particularly acute where identification of specimens includes all members of extremely divergent groups, such as the angiosperms, where the holistic approaches are impractical because of their high diversity and polythetic nature. The use of the diagnostic keys (taxonomic keys or determinators) for the identification of plants (and other organisms) is by far the most widely used method and does not require the time, experience or materials involved in comparison and recognition methods. Diagnostic keys are generally devices consisting of a series of contrasting or contradictory statements or propositions requiring the identifier to make comparisons and decisions based on statements in the key as related to the material to be identified (Quick, 1997). Diagnostic keys can be grouped into two broad types: 1) single-entry (dichotomous or sequential) keys and 2) multiple-entry keys (polyclaves). Both display only the diagnostic features and so the taxon in question can be identified without the need to refer to exhaustive descriptions that can contain a high proportion of redundant information (Geneve et al., 1997). The two key types differ mainly in the way in which differences in the features involved are arranged and presented to effect identification. The morphological traits targeted for use in keys tend to be those that vary in a qualitative rather than quantitative manner. The intra-taxon variability of characters used in keys is also an important consideration in keys construction. To avoid confusion caused by that, characters are coded as either variables or as (nearly) constant, leaving selection of a variability threshold to the researcher preparing the data (Morse, 1971). The first dichotomous keys clearly designed for identification purposes were those of Lamarck in his ‗Flore Francaise‘ in 1778. In dichotomous keys, the order in which the couplets (each is a pair of statements (leads) describes states of one character) appear in the key is of critical importance for minimising the information required for diagnosis. The number of possible identifications is progressively narrowed while working through the couplets of the key until all possibilities are eliminated except the single taxon the material is deemed to represent (Quick, 1997). Dichotomous keys constitute of two categories based on the way they are written: 1) bracketed keys and 2) indented keys. These two differ only in that, in the former the two leads of each couplet appear together, while in the later all possibilities linked to the first lead are described before the second is mentioned (Fig. 3). The choice between using either of these two layouts is to some extent a matter of a personal preference. Indented keys, however, are preferable only for short keys as the space requirements of a large key increasing become impractical.\n\nWild Plants: Identification, Uses and Conservation : Identification, Uses and Conservation, edited by Ryan E.

All rights reserved.\n\nFigure 3. Two layouts of (indented and bracketed) a dichotomous key (after Stace, 1989). In both, same 5 species (in bold) are keyed out using identical data represented by couplets 1-5.\n\nThe use of dichotomous keys requires that the specimens under consideration possess most or all characters that are used in the key. Where specimens do not possess all of the characters needed to complete passage through the key, however, the user may be forced to proceed by guessing unknown character states for the specimen in question (Duncan and Meacham, 1986). Generally, keys constructed for a large number of species (e.g., all species in a family) are based on several organs of the plant. The keys constructed by Hubbard (1968) and Stace (1997) for the grass family (Poaceae) provide an example of such keys. However, for a small number of species, organ-specific (e.g., leaves and flowers) keys are common. For instance, Stace (1997) constructed inflorescence-based keys for five Vulpia species. It follows that closely related taxa may not always occupy adjacent positions in the key and therefore their positions in the key bears no 'a priori' indication of the evolutionary distance between the taxa being distinguished. Such keys, therefore, are termed 'artificial keys'. In multiple entry keys, the user has the choice in each stage to select the characteristics for use in identifying the specimen in question, taking his selection from a predefined list of characters. For each character, the user classifies the specimen into a group of taxa according to which a possible alternate character state is manifested in the specimen being identified. This process is continually repeated until a tentative identification is made. Sokal and Sneath (1966), and Williams (1967) first noted the possibility of using computerizing polyclave keys for identification, an approach that has recently found in favour for handling large numbers of species (see below). These types of keys allow the user to select the most obvious or available characters first, and to choose unusual attributes that help to eliminate majority of the taxa. In this sense, they provide a more flexible tool for identification than dichotomous keys. On the other hand, characters are often given more or less equal weight and so there is generally no control to guide the user towards the most reliable diagnostic features. It is also possible to generate two or more different diagnoses when atypical specimens such as hybrids are examined. Care needs to be exercised in the construction of such keys to overcome this problem. This contrasts to dichotomous keys present where such specimens are usually unresolved.\n\nWild Plants: Identification, Uses and Conservation : Identification, Uses and Conservation, edited by Ryan E.

On-line identification programs are based on the step-by-step elimination as in diagnostic keys. They work in a question-answer manner between the identifier and the machine, and the user is free to choose characters for the elimination of species. These programs require the use of a computer and a high degree of interaction (Pankhurst, 1974). Bonnie and Snow (2002) created an on-line identification key to the vascular plants of the Laramie Foothills region in North Central Colorado using Lucid Professional software. Computer-Assisted Diagnosis in Plants The possibility of computerizing key construction has been mentioned frequently since the early 1960s. Efficient keys are those that can provide the simplest and most free route to any answer. Meeting these needs, however, for a large group of plants may place heavy effort on the classifier (Hall, 1970). A practical solution for such case would be the use of computers to process, store and retrieve diagnostic keys (Morse et al., 1968). This need led to the creation of the first computer-assisted identification programs in the beginning of the 1970s (Forget et al., 1986). Pankhurst (1974) provided a comparison of some of these programs. Computerised diagnosis usually implies the principles of multi-access keys rather than sequential keys, and most modern programs can accommodate for atypical phenotypes in one or two of the many characters involved. Bonnie and Snow (2002) recognised five advantages in the construction of diagnostic keys by computer compared to manual diagnosis: 1) once the data has been collected, the production of keys is simple, 2) keys can be easily revised if errors are found or new taxa or characters need to be added, 3) the probability of incorrect identifications is reduced, 4) characters of the specimen to be identified can be entered in any order, and 5) the user can confirm the correct identification of the unknown specimen by calling up digital images and text boxes that further describe the taxon. Dallwitz (1974) created a computer program called ‗KEY‘ for generating identification keys. The author reported its flexibility, reliability, speed, minimising the number of characters used, low cost, and minimising the intra-taxon variation. Duncan and Meacham (1986) described the application of a general-purpose multiple-entry key algorithm called ‗MEKA‘.\n\nComputer-Stored Keys Computers can be used to step through a traditional dichotomous key in a way that the computer asks a question, waits for an answer, and then proceeds to the next couplet. Keys of this sort offer no direct advantage over printed keys and have the limitation of requiring using the computer for the performance of each identification (Morse, 1975). On the other hand, the advent of laptop, palm top and notepad computer hardware may overcome this limitation and\n\nWild Plants: Identification, Uses and Conservation : Identification, Uses and Conservation, edited by Ryan E.

Nova Science Publishers, Incorporated. All rights reserved.\n\nTraditional dichotomous identification keys can readily be constructed from machinereadable files of taxonomic information. The difficulty of this topic lies in the collection of data and coding. The commonest approach to key construction by computer is a recursive algorithm that repeatedly divides sets of taxa into pairs of mutually exclusive subsets on the basis of one or more taxonomic characters (Morse, 1975). Westfall et al. (1986) described a new method of identification combining features of polyclave and dichotomous keys. It is based on presence or absence of characters, and is presented in the form of a matrix with the characters in rows and the taxa in columns. The ‗PHYTOTAB‘ program package is used to order the matrix in order to enable identification. This method combines the flexibility of the former and the ease of reproduction of the latter, making it efficient for rapid identification. All strategies of identification discussed above are based only on morphological characters. Whilst morphological descriptions form the basis for the definition of species and all other taxonomic ranks, there are many instances when the amount of material available is insufficient to enable identification using any of the above strategies. This may be the case at certain times of the year, or where only one plant part is available or even when the material is no longer in a recognisable form (e.g., in processed foodstuffs). This may render diagnosis using morphological traits impossible and necessitate alternative means of sample discrimination. In such circumstances, the use of molecular approaches for the recognition of taxa often represents the most attractive strategy.\n\nTHE NEED FOR MOLECULAR IDENTIFICATION OF PLANT SPECIES The need for plant species identification is both varied and widespread, and includes applications for plant breeding, agricultural seed industry, food processing, conservation biology, forensic analysis and many other aspects of plant science. The level of precision required varies according to type of application. For instance, in plant breeding, Poulsen et al. (1996) argued that it is essential to accurately identify the parent species of pre-breeding program prior to performing any cross-pollination. Hybridisation between different outcrossing plant species has been reported to occur naturally and numerous studies have attempted to characterise or quantify the occurrence of spontaneous hybrids in natural habitats (e.g., Stace, 1975). In works of this kind, it is clearly important to be able to distinguish both parental species from the hybrid and also from each other. Interest in the quantification of interspecific hybridisation has increased dramatically with the commercial cultivation of genetically modified (GM) crops, where attention is focussed on the ecological consequences of transgene recruitment by wild relatives of GM crops through gene flow (Lavigne et al., 2002; Haider et al., 2009).\n\nWild Plants: Identification, Uses and Conservation : Identification, Uses and Conservation, edited by Ryan E. Davis, Nova Science Publishers,\n\nCopyright © 2011. Nova Science Publishers, Incorporated. All rights reserved.\n\n18\n\nNadia Haider\n\nIn 2003, Hammer et al. estimated plant accessions conserved in gene banks worldwide as six million. The authors believe that all of these accessions belong to a very limited number of species, and that approximately 15% are wild relatives of crop species and weeds. The authors reviewed the most important aspects of plant biodiversity for conservation. Molecular markers allow the characterisation of genetic diversity in germplasm collections of endangered plant species. This, in turn, helps accomplish successful conservation of the species of interest. Therefore, Segarra-Moragues et al. (2005) confirmed that genetic fingerprinting of germplasm accessions of Borderea chouardii (Dioscoreaceae), one of the most critically endangered Iberian plants, can aid for better species conservation. Börner (2006) also reported that although wild ancestors have continued to persist in regions where their domestication took place, there is a great risk of loss of the genetic variability of cultivated plants and their wild relatives in response to changes in the environmental conditions and cultural practices. Hence, accurate identification of plant species is essential for the maintenance of germplasm collections (Bechmann et al., 1999). Wild species are sources of resistance genes for various biotic and abiotic stresses. Hence, they are considered as a genetic pool for the improvement of crop species. Reliable species diagnosis is also necessary for the conservation and use of plant genetic resources that are essential for the efficient maintenance and improvement of agricultural and forestry crops (Karp et al., 1997; Rout et al., 2003) since many wild relatives of crops are threatened and endangered to extinction (Prance, 1997). For instance, Page (1994) surveyed the conservation status of rare and endangered conifers and associated temperate rainforest tree species by providing a scientifically sound strategy to minimise further genetic erosion (loss of genetic diversity) of an already fragmented wild tree resource. Ozden-Tokatli et al. (2010) reported that in order to minimise the genetic erosion of Pistacia germplasm, national and international (especially IPGRI and IFAR) institutions have initiated projects proposing to characterize, collect and conserve Pistacia germplasm. Karp et al. (1997) stated that accurate genetic distinction of all species is required in order to place the highest estimate on the most genetically distinct groups in conservation. Muller (2002) presented a case study that discussed the management practices required to ensure conservation of rare and locally threatened plant species in grasslands, and Reinhammar et al. (2002) focussed on the conservation of an endangered grassland plant species; Pseudorchis albida. Molecular data have additionally been of great value for ensuring identity and integrity of accessions (a group of similar plants received from a single source at a single time) held within a collection does not change through unwanted gene flow or by genetic drift after regeneration by seed (Karp et al., 1997). Bechmann et al. (1999) believed that identification of mislabelled or unintentionally duplicated material within and between germplasm collections is a fundamental issue for germplasm conservation. Furthermore, when germplasm collections are stored in genebanks as seeds, the characterisation of seeds and checking the seeds contamination is widely viewed as important (Ford-Lloyd et al., 1997). In situ conservation efforts (conservation of species within their natural habitats) equally have need for reliable species identification (Brush, 1995). There is increasing interest in this strategy particularly to protect wild relatives of crop species (Hawtin and Hodgkin, 1997) largely because issues of mislabelling, inadvertent seed mixing and artificial selection are less of an issue for this type of conservation measure. Tewksbury et al. (1999) suggested that insufficient effort has been expended to protect wild species in their natural habitats by in situ\n\nWild Plants: Identification, Uses and Conservation : Identification, Uses and Conservation, edited by Ryan E. Davis, Nova Science Publishers,\n\nCopyright © 2011. Nova Science Publishers, Incorporated.

There is, therefore, a great need to identify all species comprising habitats containing targeted species for conservation so that their abundance can be readily monitored over time (Karp et al., 1997). Yuan et al. (2010) believe that the wild resources of the medicinal plant, Scutellaria baicalensis (Lamiaceae) still need to be protected in situ and the evolutionary consequences of extensive seed exchange mediated by human being should be monitored carefully. Maxted et al. (1997) defines ex situ conservation as ‗the maintenance of components of biological diversity outside their natural habitats‘. A comprehensive international ex situ program aims to conserve crop and wild germplasms in genebanks (as accessions) and botanical gardens (contain representatives of populations lost in the wild) (Brush, 1995). McGregor et al. (2002) analysed the wild potato germplasm of the series Acaulia with molecular markers and discussed its implications for ex situ conservation. Li and Pritchard (2009) believe that ex situ seed storage underpins global agriculture and food supplies and enables the conservation of thousands of wild species of plants within national and international facilities. Malus sylvestris Mill., the apple species native to Europe, is one of the most endangered tree species in Lithuania; those that remain are very scattered. Therefore, the construction of a gene bank that can be used as a new interbreeding population is seen as a necessary step for its future conservation (Coart et al., 2003). The distinction between species helps checking the true identity of material entering the genebank. Martin et al. (1997), for example, found Oryza meridionalis to be misidentified when they compared it with material reserved in a genebank. One of the main objectives of ex situ conservation is minimising genetic erosion on crops gene pools (Brush, 1995). Maunder et al. (2001) highlighted the dangers of hybridisation in ex situ collections. Available strategies for maintenance and management of germplasm collections are reviewed by Börner (2006), considering modern biotechnologies (in vitro and cryopreservation). Li and Pritchard (2009) stated that the assumptions, costs, risks and scientific challenges associated with ex situ plant conservation depend on the species, the methods employed and the desired storage time. The authors reviewed the science and economics of ex situ plant conservation.\n\nMolecular Tools Used for Plant Species Identification Genetic variation in plants has been reported at all taxonomic levels. This variation can be exploited for the identification of plants at all taxonomic ranks (Powell et al., 1996b). Blaxter (2003) stated that ‗it is impossible to describe biological diversity with traditional approaches. Molecular methods are the way forward especially, perhaps, in the form of DNA barcodes‘ (discussed later). The development of various molecular techniques that generate molecular markers has made it possible to accurately identify plants. These techniques either exploit differences at the level of the deoxyribonucleic acids (DNA) or of the protein encoded by it. Wagner (1996) reviewed morphological discrimination between wild and cultivated apple trees. Coart (2003), however, concluded that the resolution of assignment of individuals to the wild and/or cultivated gene pool reached by molecular markers is much higher when molecular markers revealed a very clear differentiation among the wild gene pool, edible and ornamental apple cultivars.\n\nWild Plants: Identification, Uses and Conservation : Identification, Uses and Conservation, edited by Ryan E. Davis, Nova Science Publishers,\n\n20\n\nNadia Haider\n\nMolecular markers are biochemical constituents (e.g., secondary metabolites in plants) and macromolecules, viz. proteins and DNA that play a very important role in plant taxonomy, physiology, embryology, breeding, ecology, genetic fingerprinting, genetic engineering etc. (Mittal and Dubey, 2009).\n\nCopyright © 2011. Nova Science Publishers, Incorporated. All rights reserved.\n\nMolecular Marker Methods Based on Protein Analysis Proteins are the primary product of genes. When the nucleotide sequence of the DNA changes, so too do the proteins banding patterns (IPGR and Cornell University, 2003). Seed storage proteins and isozymes (described below) have been the most popular protein-based markers used for plant identification. Seed storage proteins are defined by Higgins (1984) as those proteins that occur in large amounts in the developing seeds, and that provide nitrogen for early seedling growth when hydrolysed. Electrophoresis is a chromatographic technique for separating mixtures of ionic compounds. It has been adapted as a common tool for biochemical analysis (IPGR and Cornell University, 2003). The diversity of such proteins has long been used for the identification of a range of plant species. For example, Moller and Spoor (1993) distinguished three Lolium species analysed based on the seed protein banding patterns when fractionated by Polyacrylamide Gel Electrophoresis (PAGE). Bianchi-Hall et al. (1993) also analyzed 55 accessions of wild peanuts (Arachis spp.) introduced from South America for seed storage protein composition using sodium dodecyl sulphate (SDS)-PAGE electrophoresis. The study showed that great diversity exists for protein profiles and seed storage proteins have potential for aiding species classification and for serving as markers for interspecific hybridization studies. In order to study genetic variation of wild wheat relatives, electrophoretic patterns of seed storage proteins, the high-molecular-weight glutenins and gliadins from about 12 wild species and some check improved cultivars were fractionated by SDS-PAGE and Acid-PAGE. The electrophoresis proved to be a suitable method to discriminate wheat species (Sofalian and Valizadeh, 2009). This category of proteins, however, has been used principally for the discrimination of cultivars rather than species. For example, Cai and Bullen (1992) were able to differentiate cultivars in the forage crop timothy (Phleum pratense L.) using SDS-PAGE analysis of their seed storage proteins. Seed storage proteins have proved to be of only limited value for identification of plant species due to: 1) the long time required for protein separation (typically 5-6 h) for the routine and large-scale identification, 2) the polymorphism they present is often due to a very low number of loci, and most importantly 3) band profiles can vary under the influence of different environmental conditions (Gepts, 1995). Indeed, Blanco et al. (1996) reported that the number and size of Quantitative Trait Loci (QTLs) controlling seed storage proteins concentration in kernels of durum wheat (Triticum turgidum var. durum) varied widely across environments. Such sensitivity of phenotype to environmental changes clearly compromises the utility of storage proteins for the purposes of reliable diagnosis. In a recent study carried out by Gao et al. (2010), the authors concluded that the main drawback of SDS-PAGE was its overestimation of molecular mass and incorrect identification of HMW-GS due to its low resolution. However, they believe that it is suitable for large-scale and high-throughput HMW-GS screening for breeding programs, especially\n\nWild Plants: Identification, Uses and Conservation : Identification, Uses and Conservation, edited by Ryan E.

Enzymes electrophoresis can directly reveal genetic polymorphism through demonstrating the multiple forms of a specific enzyme (IPGR and Cornell University, 2003). The use of electrophoresis analysis of multi-locus isozymes (a class of multiple, separable forms of enzymes (= isoenzymes) occurring within the same organism and having similar or identical catalytic activities) has been reported for the assessment of overall genetic differences and similarities between plant species and identification of various plant taxa. Starch gel electrophoresis is the preferred matrix for isozyme electrophoresis. The use of isozymes markers (introduced by Hunter and Markert in 1957) for identification purposes has proved valuable since these molecules do not significantly converge in evolutionary terms but rather change at a steady rate (Lowenstein, 1985). For example, isozyme patterns and their genetic control in three Centrosema species (Leguminosae) were described by Penteado et al. (1997). Apavatjrut et al. (1999) similarly used isozyme analysis to aid the reliable distinction between some Curcuma L. species. In 2000, Lange et al. concluded that isozyme patterns, especially when several systems are employed, are reliable and useful biochemical markers for the taxonomic delimitation and characterization of Trifolium germplasm when they observed that the species groupings are consistent with traditional taxonomic species delimitation. Vab den Heede et al. (2002), likewise, used the approach to differentiate between Asplenium cyprium and A. lolegnamense. The authors reported that isozyme polymorphism and variability within and between populations and species were relatively high and allowed discrimination among species. The applications of isozymes in studies on plant genetic diversity are reviewed by IPGRI and Cornell University (2003). Recently, Petrokas and Stanys (2008) revealed the isozyme resemblances in the leaf peroxidase of wild apple and defined the traits related to the identification of Malus sylvestris Mill. It was possible to generate species-specific peroxidase markers for this species. In a study carried out by ONeill and Mathias (1995), isozymes also proved valuable genetic markers for the identification of hybrid plant species in Brassica L. Similarly, Hirose et al. (1993) identified and estimated genetic variation of the hybrids between cultivated tetraploid common buckwheat (Fagopyrum esculentum, 2n=32) and the wild perennial species (F. cymosum, 2n=32) based on esterase isozyme analysis. Although the technique of isozyme analysis is relatively easy, robust and highly reproducible (IPGRI and Cornell University, 2003), inexpensive and allows simultaneous analysis of several individuals and isozyme systems, it has inherent problems (Brown and Weir, 1983) that limit its value for large-scale applications such as: 1) there are only a limited number of reliable isozyme systems available (Stuessy, 1990), 2) some species can prove problematic to assay, 3) it is phenotype-based, 4) relatively few biochemical assays are available to detect enzymes (IPGRI and Cornell University, 2003), and 5) isozymes are available only in small numbers (Torres et al., 1993). Added to that isozyme analysis is usually a time-consuming process (extraction of enzymes and staining reactions) and illsuited for the simultaneous analysis of many samples (Ballve et al., 1995). Furthermore, inferring homology between species examined in isozymes analysis depends on comigration of isozymes through the gel matrix (Arnold and Emms, 1998). This assumption is not always justified. More importantly, Delavega (1996) stated that metabolic processes are controlled by enzymes, influenced by the environment and used to react in response to it. Henry (1999)\n\nWild Plants: Identification, Uses and Conservation : Identification, Uses and Conservation, edited by Ryan E. Davis, Nova Science Publishers,\n\n22\n\nNadia Haider\n\nconfirmed that when he found out that isozyme analysis can be sensitive to environmental variation. This point is aptly illustrated by the work of Asins et al. (1995), who evaluated isozymes for the identification of Citrus species and detected differences within some trees attributable mainly to the position of the leaf relative to the sunlight and the age of the leaf.\n\nDNA-Based Molecular Methods of Plant Identification\n\nCopyright © 2011.

Thus at the DNA level, plants differ from animals in the possession of the chloroplast DNA (cpDNA) (Fig. 4) and in that their mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) is much larger and structurally more variable.\n\nFigure 4. Diagram of chloroplast genome representing most land plants (after Soltis et al., 1992). This genome is circular and constitutes of a large single copy (LSC), a small single copy (SSC), and two inverted repeats (IRs). The locations of some chloroplast genes are shown on the genome.\n\nThe nuclear genome contrasts strikingly with the chloroplast genome. The inheritance of cpDNA is clonal and it is most commonly inherited from only one parent, almost always through the maternal parent in angiosperms (Fig. 5) (e.g., Kengyilia, Zhang et al., 2009), and the paternal parent in gymnosperms such as red and black spruce (Picea) (Bobola et al., 1996). Paternal inheritance of the cpDNA, however, has been observed in some angiosperm plant species such as species of genera Actinidia (Testolin and Cipriani, 1997), Larrea (Zygophyllaceae), Medicago, Turnera, Pharbitis and Actinidia as stated by Yang et al. (2000). In a number of flowering plants, however, both parents contribute. In most plants species and even in some cultivated crops, the inheritance mode of chloroplasts is not defined yet (see Scott and Wilkinson, 1999). The maternal inheritance of cpDNA means that the latter is moved only by seed and not by pollen and therefore being highly structured compared to the nDNA (Petit et al., 1993). Owing to this mode of inheritance, lower effective population sizes and the potential for periodic selection (Maruyama and Birky, 1991), cpDNA experience different patterns of\n\nWild Plants: Identification, Uses and Conservation : Identification, Uses and Conservation, edited by Ryan E.
