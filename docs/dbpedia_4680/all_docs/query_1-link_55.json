Born on October 11, 1942 in Allahabad, Uttar Pradesh, India, Bachchan's journey in the film industry began in the early 1970s. He is the son of renowned Hindi poet Harivansh Rai Bachchan and social activist Teji Bachchan. His educational qualifications include a double major in Science and Arts from Delhi University. Bachchan's initial years in Bollywood were met with struggle and rejection due to his unconventional looks and deep baritone voice. However, these very characteristics later became his trademark. He shot to stardom with the film Zanjeer in 1973, earning him the title Angry Young Man. Over the course of his career, he starred in over 200 films, many of which are considered classics, such as Sholay, Deewar, Don, and Black. His portrayal of diverse characters with exceptional versatility won him numerous awards, including multiple National Film Awards and Filmfare Awards. Despite facing a life-threatening injury during the shooting of Coolie in 1982, Bachchan's resilience saw him return to the screen stronger than ever. In addition to his film career, he hosted the popular television game show Kaun Banega Crorepati, the Indian adaptation of Who Wants to be a Millionaire?. Bachchan's contribution to the arts extends beyond acting; he lent his voice as a playback singer in several movies and narrated numerous films. Recognising his outstanding contribution to the Indian film industry, the Government of India honoured him with the Padma Shri in 1984, the Padma Bhushan in 2001, and the Padma Vibhushan in 2015.\n\nVijay, born as Joseph Vijay Chandrasekhar, is a prodigy of South Indian cinema. An embodiment of talent, he was born and raised in Chennai, India, on June 22, 1974. His parents, S. A. Chandrasekhar and Shoba Chandrasekhar, both prominent figures of the Tamil film industry, were instrumental in shaping his passion for acting. Vijay completed his education at Loyola College, Chennai, before making his entry into the film industry. Vijay's journey in the film industry began at an early age with his debut in the drama Naalaiya Theerpu directed by his father. Despite a less than stellar start, Vijay remained undeterred and went on to star in films across various genres, proving his mettle as a versatile actor. His breakthrough performance came in the form of the romantic-comedy film Poove Unakkaga, which firmly established him as a leading actor in the Tamil film industry. Over the years, he has given performances that have been both commercially successful and critically acclaimed. His roles in movies like Ghilli, Thuppakki, and Mersal are highly regarded and have earned him numerous awards. Apart from being a gifted actor, Vijay is also known for his philanthropic activities. He founded the Vijay Makkal Iyakkam, a social welfare organization, through which he has been involved in several charitable activities. He has been consistently engaged in providing assistance during natural calamities and extending support to the underprivileged.\n\nKamal Haasan, a name synonymous with the Indian film industry, was born on November 7, 1954, in Paramakudi, Tamil Nadu, India. His journey in cinema began at an early age of six with the film Kalathur Kannamma, for which he received the President's Gold Medal.

His directorial ventures, such as Hey Ram and Virumaandi, are equally lauded for their innovative storytelling and technical brilliance. Throughout his illustrious career, Haasan has been honored with numerous awards and recognitions.
