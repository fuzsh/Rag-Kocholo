An official of the network which operates Siyatha TV and Real radio said that according to initial reports it was an arson attack.\n\nJuly 29, 2010\n\nThanks to Weerawansa�s �farce unto death� on a saline drip, major media �Ustaads� have been exposed even without a fig leaf to hide their professional nudity. Unfortunately, the media is not judged on their performance and taken to task for their lapses.\n\nJuly 29, 2010"
