        "text": "Wednesday, 03 December 2008 19:26\n\nThe UNP has responded to a statement issued by Five Media over remarks made by Opposition Leader Ranil Wickremesinghe at a recent media briefing with regard to ‘Daily Mirror’ newspaper.\n\nThe statement, signed by UNP General Secretary Tissa Attanayake says, “The UNP and the people of this country are alert to the double-standards of Five Media which claims to represent media freedom of this country.”\n\nIt also questions Five Media for having come up with an immediate statement to condemn Mr. Wickremesinghe’s answer to questions at the media briefing, while being disinterested in issuing a statement on the unethical media policy of the ‘Daily Mirror’ editor.\n\nMr. Attanayake says, the UNP will keep watch on the steps Five Media would take with regard to the ‘Daily Mirror’ having published its statement without the references it has to the editor of the newspaper.\n\nThe full statement of the UNP General Secretary addressing the Five Media\n\nYour five media organizations have issued a joint statement with regard to the answers given by Opposition Leader Ranil in response to questions posed by the ‘Daily Mirror’ journalist at the media briefing held in Colombo. On behalf of the UNP, I am making this clarification.\n\nAt the above media briefing, Opposition Leader Ranil Wickremesinghe had only answered the questions posed by the ‘Daily Mirror’ journalist. Despite the claim in the joint statement by Five Media, the Opposition Leader had not shown any resentment while fielding the questions.\n\nMedia organizations should have a clear understanding by now about the manner in which the lady editor of ‘Daily Mirror’ manages the national newspaper in accordance with her personal wishes. The most immediate case in point is that of the lady editor of ‘Daily Mirror’ publishing the joint statement issued by you after axing the references critical of her.\n\nPublishing a media statement after editing its content to suit one’s needs is a matter that questions media ethics. The UNP will keep a close tab on what practical action Five Media will take in that regard.\n\nThis was not the first instance where the lady editor of ‘Daily Mirror’ had used the national newspaper to cater to her personal needs and wishes. Continued silence of Five Media when a national newspaper continues to be used for personal purposes is a matter that needs to be questioned.\n\nOn a previous occasion, Five Media issued a statement on an alleged incident of the Opposition Leader having telephoned and reprimanded ‘Daily Mirror’ journalist Mr. Kelum Bandara. That statement had been issued without getting the Opposition Leader’s side of the storey. It has now been established that it was Mr. Kelum Bandara who had given the telephone call. To date, Five Media has not issued a statement to correct that false claim.\n\nI would like to bring to your attention the discussion Messrs. Sanath Balasuriya, Uvindu Kurukulasuriya and Poddala Jayantha – all of whom claim to represent media freedom of this country – had with the President at Temple Trees.\n\nAt that meeting, the President had mentioned editors of certain newspapers by name and strongly criticised them, but Five Media has failed to issue any statement to condemning it. What had actually taken place was that the editors in question had been contacted at personal level and informed of the accusations that were leveled against them.\n\nI would also like to mention a news report posted in a website that the lady editor of ‘Daily Mirror’ had crossed her line and had advised the President on matters of diplomacy. Moments after that particular news report was posted, ‘Daily Mirror Online’ had quoted Free Media Movement’s Mr. Sunanda Deshapriya has having condemned the website’s claim.\n\nA few hours later, Mr. Sunanda Deshapriya said he had made no statement as mentioned in ‘Daily Mirror Online.’ The lady editor of ‘Daily Mirror’ who does not give space of her newspaper to statements of certain organizations including FMM, came up with a strong statement through her national newspaper. Even at that time, Five Media was not bold enough to issue a statement.\n\nWhen Messrs. Sanath Balasuriya and Poddala Jayantha requested a meeting with the lady editor of ‘Daily Mirror’, she had ordered that the two should not be allowed even to enter Wijeya Newspapers Ltd. premises. Even on that occasion Five Media did not issue a statement in haste.\n\nNewspaper editors held a discussion with Opposition Leader Ranil Wickremesinghe on the threats facing media institutions and media personnel under the present administration. The lady editor of ‘Daily Mirror’ did not attend that meeting that was held at a time when both media institutions and media personnel were in a difficult situation. That apart, the lady editor of ‘Daily News’ avoided meeting the Opposition Leader even after she was given a special appointment. Even here, the Five Media did not come up with a statement over the conduct of the lady editor of ‘Daily Mirror.’\n\nIt is questionable that Five Media had come up with an immediate statement to condemn Opposition Leader Ranil Wickremesinghe’s answer to several questions at the media briefing, while being disinterested in issuing a statement on the unethical media policy of the ‘Daily Mirror’ editor.\n\nLearning from the past and taking into consideration the present incidents, it is clear whom the Sri Lanka Working Journalists’ Association, the Federation of Media Employees’ Trade Union, Sri Lanka Muslim Media Forum, Sri Lanka Tamil Media Alliance and Free Media Movement represent.\n\nI would like to remind you that the UNP and the people of this country are alert to the double-standards of Five Media which claims to represent media freedom of this country.\n\nStatement issued by Five Media\n\nOur organizations regret and condemn as unfitting of democratic political culture, the resentment shown by Opposition Leader Ranil Wickremesinghe to questions posed by the ‘Daily Mirror’ journalist at a media briefing on December 01st and his criticism of the editor of the newspaper.\n\nAt that media briefing, when the ‘Daily Mirror’ journalist had questioned on the UNP’s plans at future elections, the opposition leader had said that the question should be posed to Kesara Abeywardena of ‘Daily Mirror’ and the editor of the newspaper. The opposition leader had also denounced an article by the deputy editor in which he had been described as a weak leader, and had asked the journalist to inform Kesara Abeywardena to come for a debate on the said article.\n\nOur media organizations believe that any media or media personnel has the right to express ideas through the media within the boundaries of the ethics of the profession. We consider it bad precedence that an important person like the Opposition Leader adopts a resentful approach towards such a right. The anti-democratic rejection of opposing views has come to take roots in Sri Lankan politics, and most politicians consider the media within that border. It is likely that any resentful criticism from any quarter would be considered by the media in a negative light at a time when there is serious repression of the media. Therefore, our organizations request all political leaders and movements to refrain from resentful responses and resolve their differences with the media in a more democratic manner.\n\nOur organizations would like to mention that we too, have reservations with regard to the conduct of the lady editor of ‘Daily Mirror’. It appears that there is personal influence on the reportage of the newspaper. Our organizations firmly believe that politicians as well as the media should use the media in a manner that earns confidence and respect of the target audience.\n\n1. 1st October – Sudaroli news paper warned\n\n2. 6th October – Journalist liked in suicide attack\n\n3. 6th October – CaFFE spokesperson victimized\n\n4. 18th October – State media accuses unmade Journalists\n\n5. 23rd October – Violence against media in the Eastern Province\n\n6. 23rd October – HR lawyers threatened\n\n7. 29th October – News paper threatened\n\n8. 30th October – new regulation to control private TV stations\n\n9.
