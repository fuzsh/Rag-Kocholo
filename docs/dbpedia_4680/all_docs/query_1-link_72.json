Sri Lankan Constitution itself places Buddhism at the foremost place. Traditionally, religion was used to define the cornerstones of governance in varying degrees. Heeding the advice of the majority religion is a way of legitimizing the existence of the rulers. It appeals to the shallow religious sentiments of the majority. more..\n\nJuly 3 (NS) Favoritism is preferential treatment, undue preference, and unfairness and is associated with partiality, bias, discrimination, unreasonable fancy, bigotry, prejudice, narrow-mindedness, lack of objectivity and chauvinism and nepotism.

Besides among all religions Buddhism is supreme in its preaching of non-violence but the Beruwala and Aluthgama incidents painted a distorted picture.

They understand its all about vote-bank politics, but do not comprehend how it works. The politicians, in turn, particularly of the majority Sinhala-Buddhist community, too assume that there is only a one-way ticket on that front  win or lose you do, but you cannot do both and more..\n\nJuly 2 (FT) Once I read a story about a butcher in England, who in order to hurt his only rival in the same town began to convert the town folk to vegetarianism!
