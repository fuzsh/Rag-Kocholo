        "text": "Sri Lanka's media outlets are generally divided along linguistic and ethnic lines. State and private media operators provide services in the main languages Sinhala, Tamil, and English. The government owns two major TV stations, radio networks operated by the Sri Lanka Broadcasting Corporation (SLBC), and newspaper titles in Sinhala, Tamil and English.[1]\n\nAfter the growth of Sri Lankan economy, many satellite TV channels were introduced.\n\nHowever, there are over a dozen privately owned radio stations and more than 30 privately operated television stations.[1] They often engage in political debates.\n\nThe use of the internet is a growing force within Sri Lanka, many of the newspapers now have online editions.[1] Because of the limited circulation for the daily and weekly newspapers, they are heavily dependent on advertising. As a result of this it is very rare to see Sri Lankan newspapers engage in investigative journalism or daring exposes of big business.\n\nContents\n\n1 Newspapers\n\n2 TV stations\n\n3 Analog Terrestrial Networks\n\n4 Local TV Channels on Satellite or Cable Networks\n\n5 Pay Television Networks (Sri Lankan Owned)\n\n6 Sri Lankan radio channels\n\n7 Internet\n\n8 Press Freedom\n\n9 See also\n\n10 References\n\n11 External links\n\nNewspapers\n\nImportant English language newspapers are the Daily Mirror, the Daily News and the Island.

They included:\n\nGold FM, Sun FM, Hiru FM, and Sooriyan FM: owned by the Asia Broadcasting Corporation\n\nE FM, Ran FM, and Shree FM: owned by Colombo Communication Limited (a subsidiary of EAP)\n\nSirasa FM, Shakthi FM, Y FM and Yes FM: owned by the Maharaja Broadcasting Corporation.\n\nThe Sri Lanka Broadcasting Corporation (SLBC) operated three national services, in Sinhala, Tamil and English. Social awareness messages are often aired on issues such as drunk-driving, drugs and health concerns.\n\nThroughout the authorities many private organizations obtained radio broadcasting licenses from the Telecommunications Regulatory Commission of Sri Lanka (TRC) and commenced operation of a number of terrestrial radio stations. By 2009, over thirty state and privately owned radio stations were in operation in Sri Lanka.

Both sides in the war make efforts to silence inconvenient reporters. Around 15 reporters received death threats from one faction or the other in 2004[32] The assassinated reporter Aiyathurai Nadesan, correspondent in Batticaloa for several Tamil media stated just prior to his assassination in 2005:\n\nWe are caught between a rock and a hard place. It is very difficult for us to check reports either with the security forces or the Tamil Tigers. And when a news item on local events is datelined Colombo, it puts us at risk of reprisals on the ground.\n\nIn 2005, the Tamil newspaper Thinakkural was threatened by Karuna. Copies of the newspaper were burned in the Eastern provinces.[33] On the other hand, distribution of the Tamil weekly Thinamurasu is blocked by the LTTE because it is close to another armed group, the EPDP.[33]\n\nBBC World Service stopped its broadcast in Sinhalese and Tamil for fear of reprisal against its reporters.[33]\n\nDuring the Rajapaksa administration, press freedom in Sri Lanka became the \"worst in any democratic country\",[34] according to the Reporters without borders index, ranking 165th among 173 countries in the index.[35] On 21 November 2008, a twelve-member group of masked men, forcibly entered the printing press of Sunday Leader, Morning Leader and Irudina Sinhala weekly and set fire damaging printing machines and copies of newspapers printed ready for distribution. The state jammed transmission of BBC programs which contained content the government disliked.[36] The main private TV network Sirasa was repeatedly threatened by minister Mervyn Silva, attacked by a petrol bomb on 2.1.2009 and raided by gunmen on 6.1.2009, who set on fire the main control room.[37] This was in response to SLBC criticizing Sirasa's coverage of the capture of Kilinochchi.\n\nAccording to the head of the company, Chevaan Daniel: \"It's either that the citizens of Sri Lanka are able to drive around attacking institutions armed with weapons and grenades, or there is a hand behind it.\"[37]\n\nLasantha Wikramatunga, the chief editor of the English Weekly Sunday Leader, was assassinated on the Thursday January 8, 2008 by unknown gunmen. The newspaper and its editor as well as the editor of Morning Leader have been harassed and threatened continuously during the preceding three years. All Leader publications are very critical towards the government and exponents of opposition political views.[38] According to Reporters without Borders, the Rajapaksa administration blocks investigations into the murder of journalists.[33]\n\nDefence minister Gotabhaya Rajapaksa threatened to chase Chris Morris, a BBC journalists, out of the country, if he does not act responsibly.[39]\n\nLocal reporters in the country continue to be threatened, as was the case with 54-year-old M.I. Rahmathulla, who was beaten in April 2009 for reporting on political corruption in the Batticaloa region of Sri Lanka's Eastern Province.[40]\n\nSee also\n\nList of newspapers in Sri Lanka\n\nList of television networks in Sri Lanka\n\nList of radio networks in Sri Lanka\n\nSri Lanka Broadcasting Corporation\n\nReferences"
