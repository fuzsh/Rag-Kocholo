        "text": "Udupi & Gokarna Travel Blog\n\n-By AJAY SRINIVASAN\n\nSome two decades ago. It was about half-past three in the afternoon and the school bell rang one final time for the season. The entire school compound could recognize an unbridled sense of joy in our faces and a palpable sense of excitement in our hearts. Yes, the summer vacation was about to start and none of us could wait to get back home. Some of us couldn’t wait to get to the nearest ground to play our favorite sport, while for some of us, it was time to take a trip to the grand parents’ home. For a few others, it was time for their annual vacation with parents. And there are a few others, who would sit back at home with a “Young World” magazine and munch their favorite snack or play indoor games with their siblings. Those were the days, when “summer camps” probably did not arrive, the IPL was non-existent (and summer was therefore an off-season if you are a cricket follower) and air-conditioner was not a household product. There was no internet, no smartphones and no 24/7 access to movies. There would be one television at home and the majority had access only to the public broadcaster.\n\nA coastal city like Chennai has a distinct advantage that gives you the urban life of a metro city along with the pleasures of the beaches. Those days, a beach in Chennai would often mean the Marina beach. A trip to the Marina, by itself, was a travel to cherish. A suburban electric train would take you to “Chennai Fort” where you interchange and take an “MRTS” and alight at Chepauk or Triplicane or Mylapore. You then cross the pedestrian and walk to the beach. The Elliot’s beach was tougher to access, the VGP Golden Beach was probably a luxury trip and beaches beyond the VGP in the ECR were unknown! In the last decade, when the city expanded, I grew-up and we also moved to the south-east of Chennai. So, the “ECR” beaches in Akkarai, Neelangarai, Uthandi, etc. turned out to be just a 30-min drive on my car. The ones in Mahabalipuram or Pondichery can be planned even with a momentary notice.\n\nBecause we live in a coastal city, historically our vacations were often been to hill stations. This changed in the recent past, with trips to Allepey, Kanyakumari & beach locales occupying our holiday calendar. A recent road-trip to Goa last year was a pathbreaker. We realized there is more to this than meets the eye in beach locations. Our wedding anniversary was approaching and we usually plan a trip around this season. With our daughter going to (or attending) Kindergarten, taking a few days off is not going to be a challenge. While we did explore a few places abroad, we decided to stick to the locales of India due to the ongoing pandemic. With the last year trip to Goa still fresh in memory, we wanted to explore similar yet beautiful places. We zeroed in on Coastal Karnataka- Gokarana & Udupi. I liked the idea as it would water two plants with one hose- the culmination of spiritual world and coastal world. While we contemplated doing another road trip, we later decided to fly, which is a time-saver. Our daughter also wanted a flight trip and that made it a straightforward decision.\n\nWhile I have mostly taken flights in the busy hours of morning for my official trips, taking an evening flight felt a bit surreal. The hurriedness of morning hours, tensed-up faces and the passengers trying to complete a quick breakfast- were all absent. Evening hours has that sense of calmness and our daughter’s face was as bright as a star when we onboarded the flight! Are you fond of train travels or do you prefer going by road? Do you like taking flights or do you find air travel less interesting? Leave me with your comments! If you have some time during your next flight trip or a train journey, it might be a good idea to re-live my blog about Courtallam and Papanasam here:\n\nAfter a night’s rest, we were ready to explore Udupi. Having arrived the previous night, we had two full days to see around Udupi. I often believe in the saying “Make hay while sun shines”. Take the case with Rahul, our cab driver was lamenting the pandemic days and how the tourism industry suffered with lockdowns and weekend curfews. Now that we are in the unlock state, he is happy with tourists starting to return. “No regrets. I managed to get some “home time” for myself during the pandemic” said Rahul in Kannada making subtle reactions to the tough pandemic days and he is making the most of his busy days now. In life, you must always strike when the iron is hot. You never know when the next opportunity would come. If you want have only 30 minutes today and missed doing your exercise, better to do it today than postponing the unknown to tomorrow! If you like travelling, do it now. I repeat: “Make hay while the sun shines”.\n\nIt was a mid-February morning at Coastal Karnataka and the sun was indeed shining blazing hot! The morning hours were wisely reserved for the spiritual trips. With sun glowing in full flow, the temples offered both tranquility and they also let you escape from the sun. First stop was at Lord Udupi Krishna temple, where the deity is worshipped through a silver-plated window. A drive to the south of Udupi (with a view of 25-feet Madhvacharya idol) takes you to Pajaka Kshetra, the birth place of philosopher Sri Madhvacharya and this place can give you positive vibes. The next stop was at Parashurama Temple, located atop Vimana Giri Hill. The murti of Parashurama in the temple is carved out of black stone. This is a temple that should not be missed because temples dedicated to Parashurama, are very rare and can be found only in Coastal Karnataka & Kerala. A visit to the famous Durga Devi temple, a nice hill-top temple, completed our morning spiritual tour. After completing our Udupi meal and a short afternoon nap, we were ready for the actual fun!\n\nIn the scenic backdrop of clear-blue skies, with tall brown branches of the lush green coconut trees reflecting on a mirror-like river on either side, Kemmannu Hanging Bridge– a 100-metre bridge with picturesque setting– is a nature lover’s delight! Hanging right in the middle of the river with wilderness around it, a tranquil walk takes you to the other side. The backyard had a quaint setting and I enjoyed relaxing on a hammock (a sling tied between two trees) while looking at the beautiful river. With salt & spices sprangled over the fruit, we tasted cut-pieces of mouth-watering pineapples. Kemmannu Hanging Bridge offers an array of water sports- kakaying, boating and river rafting. But I had other ideas. All I wanted was to pounce on to the hammock, sit back and get an uninterrupted view of the pristine waters. We slowly chipped away after taking a drink of tender coconut water.\n\nDelta Beach, located at an estuary where the Swarna river meets the Arabian Sea, was an absolute delight! Climbing down to the beach, you are greeted with a mesmerizing view of the vast Arabian sea on one side and River Swarna on the other side. Before setting foot on the sand, one can stand atop and view the beach from the top. And once you step in, Delta Beach is a photographer’s paradise and offers breathtaking views. The place is quite scenic and is also ideal for those who are fond of swimming on the beach. Delta Beach was a dream start to the evening.\n\nWe then moved to Malpe Beach, a beach that reminded us of one of the beaches in North Goa. Malpe beach was bustling and was with full of people. Fun vibes. Celebratory mood. Restaurants & food outlets. Hut atop to give you some shade. Kids play-area. Para sailing, Boat ride, Water scooter, Horse/camel riding, beach cricket, paint ball shooting, Kids bungee jumping. You can tick all boxes as Malpe Beach is a commercialized & busy beach that can keep you busy. However, we did none of those activities except letting our daughter play at the kids play-area. Malpe Beach rounded off what was really an energetic day at Udupi!\n\nNewsfeed on social media and flash feed on television were suddenly beaming with what was “News of the decade” in my books. The govts. Of India and Sri Lanka have agreed to collaborate for a high-speed bullet train project between Chennai & Colombo, a cutting-edge version of the “Boat Mail” that was operated until 1984. The joy of rail travel between nations with scenic views of the Indo-Lankan coast across the cantilever bridge over the Indian ocean is a tourist’s delight. The icing on the cake is the potential future of seamless & quick international travel with speedier passport & security checks. I was geared up to book tickets to the island nation, but five-minutes later, I grabbed the morning newspapers with a glass of hot water on my hand. All I realized was the Indo-Lankan fantasy train was indeed a dream in the wee hours of morning!\n\n“The miracle is not to walk on water. The miracle is to walk on the green Earth in the present moment”. High-speed train or direct flights; trip to the island nation can happen in future. A mesmerizing island in Udupi showed me there is nothing other than the single purpose of the present moment! Unique & stunning rocks, mesmerizing view of the Malpe shoreline, captivating coconut trees, marvelous & multifarious shells (our daughter collected the required quantity for generations to come!), soft sand, azuring color of the sea- with you in the middle! St. Mary Island felt out-of-the-world. It is not very often that you are so awestruck and wishes to continue forever describing a place. St. Mary Island was one of them. The effervescent charm of this place was preceded by the fabulous boat ride- a ferry service on the ocean– that took us to this island. We have been on boat rides across different waterbodies- on rivers, lakes, oceans, backwaters- during our past trips. But, this ferry gave us an unique experience. The ferry service that runs on the Arabian sea took us to a beautiful island (St.Mary Island) bordered by rocks and culminates into Arabian Sea again on the other side! Quick research tells me that the rifting of Madagascar took place 88 million years ago that led to this distinctive geological formation of rhyolitic lava. This is a geological wonder. A magnetic force. In 1498, Vasco da Gama landed on this island and named it St. Mary Island. In 2022, If you have plans to go to Andaman or Maldives or Srilanka (like how I fancied in my dreams last night), you may pause for a moment. You can tweak your bucket list and write this island name on top of your diary. You get about 60-minute time on the island before the return ferry service. Make sure you live those 60 minutes. LIVE.\n\nOn our return ferry from St.Mary Island, a few kids were dancing, a few solo travelers were awestruck with views of the ocean, couples were clicking pictures, a group of college-going friends were having fun and families were sitting back and relaxing. The jukebox was playing some of the recent hits from South Indian cinema that goes: “Paarva Karpoora Deepama; Sri Valli, Pechu Kalyani Raagama…; Paarva Karpoora Deepama; Sri Valli, Pechu Kalyani Raagama…”– a chartbuster from a Telugu superhit-“Pushpa The Rise”.\n\nOur next spot was Sea Walk Malpe– a 450 metre walkaway- giving a view of the Arabian Sea on one side and backwaters on the other side. Evening hours are the perfect time to visit this spot and the place gets prettier at night with those glorious lamp posts placed on the either side! Our 2-day itinerary didn’t allow us to explore this place in the evenings. We did a quick photo session here in the afternoon and headed to the city for lunch. If you are a foodie, Udupi has got special delicacies- like Bissi Bele Bhath, Rava Idli, Mangalore Bun or Masala Dosa. We loved the Mangalore buns for we were tasting them for the first time! We were disappointed to miss tasting Akki roti,a famous delicacy in this part of the world.\n\nAfter a short afternoon nap followed by a cup of ginger tea, we picked the evening hours to enjoy the coastal drive. One side is dedicated to the rock-clad beaches. The gorgeous trees and the beautiful backwaters forms the other side of the road! A lovely little road is engulfed between the rocky beaches and the beach-side houses. If you look upwards, you can see the evening sun that paints the sky during twilight! It was important that we timed all this to perfection. If you are in Udupi, you must do an evening drive around this scenic route. Back in Chennai, we always enjoyed our drives along the ECR, but this coastal route between Malpe & Kaup, was authentic as the roads are closer to the coast and the scenic route has that effervescent beauty that I detailed here. The coastal drive takes you to Padukere Beach, a serene beach with shimmering blue waters and squashy white sand. The beauty of this beach is that you have nothing to do here! Devoid of activities, devoid of food outlets, devoid of swimming, devoid of water sports and is also devoid of too many people! It is serene, calm and you can surrender yourself to the mesmerizing beauty of the ocean. And the alluring white sand feels so smooth on your feet.\n\nContrast that to our next destination- Kaup Beach, where we enjoyed sunset with a sea of people and munched our evening snack! I enjoyed the liveliness of this beach, where people from different walks of life kept visiting! We spotted a group of friends, after college hours, who were brimming with enthusiasm at the beach. We climbed up 150 steps to reach top of the lighthouse (open between 4 PM and 6 PM). Light-house offered us an unhindered view of the Arabian Sea, bird’s eye view of the water hitting the shores and stellar view of the rocks. Breathtaking! No, this was not a dream. I was living my dream. And with my family. On top of the world! On top of the light-house. Quite literally! Probably, it had the perfect setting to dance for “Appadi podu podu podu, Asathi podu kannaala; Ippudi podu podu podu, Izhuthu podu kaiyaalae; Appadi Podu, podu podu, Asathi Podu Kaiyaalae” from Vijay’s Ghilli- a blockbuster Tamil film from early 2000s. If only the authorities would allow me to dance on the lighthouse😊! And more importantly, if only I can dance like him😊\n\nWe headed back to the city for dinner and were set to close the day. During our dinner conversation, we spoke about the superior urban development of Tier-2 & Tier-3 cities in Karnataka. We stayed in Manipal at Udupi, a bustling town and is an upmarket destination with all branded showrooms, multiple shops, good colleges and educated people. The top-class infrastructure with wide roads were a delight to gaze during night. We were looking to buy some Yelakki bananas- a delightful small-sized, versatile variety that comes with distinctive favour & taste. I asked the fruit-seller “Intha Yelakki banana estu hai?” The fruit-seller, who was about to burst laughing understood the language barrier and helped me with a dozen bananas. When I travel to non-Tamil speaking states, I try mixing-up languages and sometimes end-up speaking local language in my mother tongue 😊\n\nMy wife would chuckle at me: “Did you speak Kannada in Tamil? 😊”\n\nUdupi has a lot more places to explore-like Jomlu Teertha, Kudlu Falls, Coin Museum, Anejhari butterfly camp, Hoode beach and Mattu Beach but it requires a lot more days in the scheduling. There are also options like Honnavar, a backwaters paradise, which is 2 hours from Udupi and you would need an extra day.\n\nPost breakfast, we checked out from Udupi and the cab-driver was waiting to take us to the next destination- Gokarna! On our way to Gokarana (about a 4-hour drive), we ensured to give it a spiritual touch and made optimal use of the time by visiting a few temples. Some of them were not part of our original itinerary, but paying heed to suggestions did help! Sri Vishnumurthy temple (in Korangrapadi), our first destination for the day, gave us tranquility. Our next stop was at Anegudde Sri Vinayagar temple, Kumbhasi. As the name suggests, the temple is the abode of elephant-headed God, Lord Vinayaga and is an important destination in this route. We then headed to Kollur Mookambika temple, a very popular and ancient temple believed to be over 1200 years old! It was significant that we reached by 12:30 PM and had a satisfying darshan before the closing hours (1:30 PM). After a gratifying & long travel day with plenty of important darshans at popular temples, we reached Gokarana in the evening for a good rest.\n\nWe like our movies to be quick and coffees to be instant. We keep running and hardly ever pause! Like a bus on the highway or a juggernaut on the countryside, we don’t want to stop. Try switching off a T20 cricket match and enjoy the pause in a Test match. It is often so beautiful. Whether purposeful or not, a pause is also beautiful. A friend of mine once asked me what I derive by writing blogs. I remember telling him: “Not everything in life need to have a purpose”.\n\nThe pause happened next morning when we woke up unhurriedly- an important facet of any vacation. It helped that the resort in Gokarana- was in complete contrast to Udupi. With limited cellphone network & no nearby shops, the resort was secluded and far away from the hustles & bustles. Venturing out for a meal is not easy and fortunately, the food was very good at the resort. Our daughter was all excited to venture into swimming pool and we let her play as much as she wanted. We then paused for lunch and then paused again! Having explored the beautiful beaches already, I had my apprehensions if there is anything left. Late in the evening, I realized that one shouldn’t judge a book by its cover and I will tell you why! “Why judge when it’s only a matter of perception”.\n\nSlowly, at around 3 in the afternoon, we were ready to explore! Thanks to my wife, who can handle a bit of Kannada, she asked the travel operator over phone: “How much it costs to explore the town?” The travel operator recommended us to hire an auto as this is the ideal mode to navigate narrow roads and also auto rides helps us get more closer to the nature.\n\nGokarna Main beach gave me vibes of putting together of different beaches- Goa, Kanyakumari and a few city beaches. Never did I imagine that we would experience the most thrilling experience of our trip in this beach. Speed does thrill and we found out why! Cruising through the Arabian Sea on a small boat at sprightly speed, the riveting ride on the wobbling waves was fascinating. With water splashing on us and with fears lingering on our hearts, we were holding on to our seats with adrenaline pumping. We found ourselves in the middle of the ocean and couldn’t help but screaming aloud! I’m not exaggerating; but the speed-boat experience did send a chill down the spine! Woah!!! This was surreal!\n\nGokarna is not all about beaches. We also leisurely explored “Shiva Caves”, a likeable locale in this landscape, that is not well-lit, but with some luck & help from the locals, this lovely location can be located! Little uphill by walk, a few steps would take you down to the cave. A torchlight will be a good assistant in this dark cave. Without caving in, just go deep inside the caves, you will be in for a surprise here. A small stroll inside the cave takes you to Lord Shiva temple!\n\nThe vagaries of nature do surprise me. If you assume that all beaches look alike, the uniqueness of each beach can take you by surprise. There is more to this than meets the eye! Om Beach in Gokarna is a natural wonder. It fascinates me that the hills and the ocean are at the same place! We experienced cool & pleasant weather at the resort only to be fooled by the sun beating down at the beach! It was chalk & cheese at the same town! The hilly terrains of Gokarna require you to do a small trek (climb down the stairs) to reach the beach. Hiking experience at the beach was so unique especially because this does not exist at the city I’m based out of. Om Beach also has a cafe and is extremely popular with the tourists. The beach had a good crowd and personally for me, it was liberating to see smiles on the face of people. Happiness is contagious and I feel happier when I see people around happy. Travelling from one rock to another in this beautiful beach, people were enjoying and talking to each other with a sense of fulfilment.\n\nOur next destination was Kudle Beach, for which you need to trek a little longer. Since this was going to be the last beach of the trip, we spent a little longer at this expansive beach. While I was sipping hot tea in one of the beach cafes, I gazed at something unique. There were mountains on one side and beach on the other side. I literally saw the sun set with mountains on its left and sea to its right! The coming together of east & west at the same place amused me! For those who wish to seek solitude, gazing at the flora and fauna of Gokarna is an excellent option. For me, the biggest moment of the evening was witnessing the merge of mountains & sea and the mountain-clad sunset in front of glistening water!\n\nGokarna has a lot more to offer. Half Moon Beach, Yana Caves, Small Hell Beach, Mirjan Fort, Belekan Beach are some of the other attractions, but we skipped those and kept it simple. Why? Well, there can be several reasons to do less; but there are two reasons that generally tops the list:\n\nOne- “The less one has to do, the less time one finds to do it in”😊\n\nTwo-“There is always so much month left at the end of money” 😊\n\nAfter a night’s rest followed by a sumptuous breakfast, we checked-out from the resort at Gokarna. We were privileged to go to a couple of temples in Gokarna before checking out! First, we visited The Mahabaleswar temple, Gokarna. This 4th century sacred temple is built in the classical architectural style. We had a late-night flight to Chennai and luckily had plenty of time on hand. With time on hand and unperturbed by large queues, we were privileged to get a sacred darshan of Shiva Linga. We also visited Sri Maha Ganapathi temple, located in close proximity. These two temples are popular and are must-visit pilgrimage destinations during a trip to Gokarna. Both these temples are located in close proximity to the main beach and it was in this vicinity, I met a cyclist with a backpack. I was eager to ask him his whereabouts as it sounded to me that he was riding long distance! After a momentary hesitation, I started a conversation and I was flabbergasted that he was cycling from Goa and was on his way to Kanyakumari. Until that moment, I thought that I had seen the best of nature over the last 4 days only to be corrected by this cyclist who said: “I see more of this beautiful world than any other traveler.” We left Gokarana with our thoughts engulfed on this passionate cyclist! Coastal Karnataka is an interesting zone that feels like a mix of Kerala & Goa.\n\nAfter a four-hour drive to the Mangalore airport, we completed the security checks and were waiting at the airport longue for our dinner. At the airport, a lovely little girl was holding two apples in her hands. Her mother, who was sitting next to her came in and asked her little daughter with a smile: “My sweetie, could you give your mom one of the two apples”. The girl looked at her mother for a few seconds, then suddenly took a quick bite on one apple and quickly on the other. The mom, tried hard not to reveal disappointment, but the smile on the mom’s face did freeze for a split second! Then the little girl handed one of her bitten apples to her mom, and said: “My dear mom, this is the sweeter apple. Please have it”. Warmed by what we witnessed, we finished our dinner and were set to board our return flight to Chennai. Talking about Chennai, which also has a beautiful coastline, expansive beaches and a charm of its own, but is strikingly dissimilar to the shores of Karnataka or Goa! We always felt the shores of Bay of Bengal that hits the Chennai coast are ferocious. Chennai city’s coastline is deceptive with powerful rip currents, wears a vicious look with those rough waves and is also dangerous to swim. This is in complete contrast to the beaches of Karnataka or Goa or say, Lakshadweep where the shallow sea bed makes it safer to swim or engage in water sports. The softer waves give you a buoyant feel and a gentle look. The vagaries of nature and how different coastlines have varied characteristics will be an interesting chapter to read. It makes a strong case to explore different beach destinations as my little experiences have proved that no two fingers are the same. Those who do not follow the game would not know the distinctive cricket balls used in the sport of Test cricket. There is SG Test Ball that is used in India, Dukes ball in England and kookaburra ball in rest of the world. The nature of these cricket balls are so different that the bowlers need to be skillful and adapt to succeed. Similarly, one need to actually visit different beaches to understand the versatility. Until our next beach holiday, we are blessed to be in Chennai where a beach trip is just 30-min away and there are quite a no. of unique beaches in Chennai! We always cherished different kinds of destinations (hills/plains/waterfalls/beaches/cities) in India, but this trip to Coastal Karnataka redefined our views of the geological wonder of motherland India. On one side, Udupi was simply fantabulous with clean & beautiful beaches, crystal-clear water, gorgeous rocks and wonderful sand. On the other side, Gokarna offered a unique blend of hilly terrains, hiking and the sea with contrasting weather. The amusing moments at the beach and those glorious evenings at the islands were perfectly blended by significant darshans at popular pilgrimage destinations. Put together, the holiday gave us solitude in epic magnitude. Coastal Karnataka is an experience to cherish- for its topography is prodigious and its landscape is pristine. Maybe a mountain vacation is next due but at the moment, we are savoring what the bays offered us! Before signing-off, I’d like to thank my family- my wife & my daughter– who have been of great company in this trip. Because you have been kind-enough to read my long blog, I will leave you with a longer tongue twister: How much wood would a woodchuck chuck if a woodchuck could chuck wood?\n\n-AJAY SRINIVASAN\n\nMy twitter feed is here:\n\ntwitter.com/ajaychairman\n\nCourtallam Travel Blog / Kutralam Travel Blog / Papanasam Travel Blog\n\n-BY AJAY SRINIVASAN\n\nConsistent weather checks of the Western Ghats and the status checks of the waterfalls that would be gushing 400 miles away! Nailing down the plan; taking time off from work! Chalking out company from family or friends. Departing from Chennai, reaching Trichy, half the distance is crossed! Trichy- Madurai-Srivilliputhur-Rajapapalayam. Gosh, I am getting closer! Reminiscent of the joy of alighting at Tenkasi junction itself gives me Goosebumps! And then the joyous transit to Courtallam. The delight of the window seat, the joy of the winds, the thrill of the chillness that would eclipse my body- all together would triple the excitement that would mount on my hearts. I would peep outside the window and then I see Melagaram. I am there, I am almost there! Five more minutes and my heartbeat would be in the most relaxed state! Courtallam is here. My unworldly place.\n\nI get down, and head to Five Falls. Each branch of the Five Falls would quench my thirst. The thirst of getting drenched. I would place my head into the mountains and would not move an inch. Each branch of the five falls (Aintharuvi) can offer you unique experience. You can choose to toggle between the hard streams and the soft streams. On good days, the setting of the clouds itself can be mesmerizing in this place. Sipping a cup of tea and munching a hot snack can be celestial after an hour at the Five Falls. Any time of the day, I would take the offer of visiting the place, but nothing beats the twilight time zone where the refreshing calmness descends into an enchanting glory. There was one such evening at Five Falls, when I was fortunate to witness seven Colors at the same time! The entire evening was so serene that was purple-fied (the color of calmness). On my left, I saw a happy kid with a brimming face exemplifying the color of joy (Orange). On my right, I saw an experienced fatherly figure waiting for his turn with a lot of wisdom. A few words with him, I realised he was carrying the color of wisdom (Blue). On my front, I witnessed an emotional story unfold as a group of friends were escorting a differently abled person to the falls. This person brought with him the color of hope ( Yellow). On the other side, the women were displaying strength in playing with the waterfall. They brought with them the color of strength (red) . In the entire setting, I witnessed the color of life (Green) where the busy vendors were bustling with liveliness. The cops brought with them the color of faith (Indigo) sincere with their announcements.\n\nYes, I witnessed the beautiful spectrum- Rainbow- when the sunlight was reflecting on water that evening. The scene of rainbow beneath the waterfall is still etched in my memory.\n\nThe relaxed walk to the main falls (Peraruvi), where the mere sight of the waterfall under floodlights can bring you unbridled joy! The sound and force of water. Well, it would take a lifetime to describe it. The environment around the place can be captivating. The families taking a stroll, the chatter among the public at night. The buzz is big. The scene is set. The midnight shower begins. A trifle at the entry, the flow would ascend as you get into the middle! We are tested! How much force our body can take? The turn at the arc. Oh! My!…. Life is a circle. Re-Start, soak your face into the water! Head to the middle, return. Re-Start.\n\nSleep. Wake-up. Life!\n\nThe Tiger falls (Puliaruvi) can surprise you when the South-West monsoon is at its bountiful best, the small falls (Chitraruvi) can sometimes unleash more force than you would imagine, but the old falls (Pazhaya Courtallam) would always prove why old is gold. How does this place bring so much comforting breeze that makes you to be grateful for life! Mornings at Old Falls can be perfectly charming. The mountains from which the water would flow resembled the steps to Paradise. The comfort of bathing in Old Falls (you can simply stay under water for a couple of hours there) is an unmatched wonder! Is there a place better than this?\n\nWell. Is there a better place than Old Falls? Not until you go to Paalaruvi, crossing state borders (a crime in COVID times??) where the pureness, freshness and and and and I’m at loss of words…, sweetness of water cannot be told, this one just had to be felt. The beauty of the place by itself is a charming story. The tranquility which you would experience during your journey to Paalaruvi (Milky falls) is unworldly. The streams would cross-by, the tall trees in the forest would pass by, a forest department vehicle would transport you to the heavenly place. The journey would bring you unparalleled chillness thanks to the greenery and positioning of the place. The tranquil shuttle service will transport you to Paalaruvi- the place that is UNBEATABLE. I can stay there all -day, but my friends would remind me to return. I would pretend not listening. I would hop-on and hop-off at the different branches of this gigantic waterfall at Paalaruvi. In one branch, the fish would offer you a natural pedicure. On another branch, you can just sit and get soaked in water. You can even take a small trek to a couple of other branches where the force would be unrelenting. Right in the middle, there is the so-called ideal branch of the waterfall, which will be comforting to your body. In essence, you can take a tour within tour in this wonderful place. Repeat. Repeat. And Repeat.\n\nThe next morning, we would travel on the opposite direction to have a dip at Ambasamuthiram river and make a trip to Agasthiyar Falls. Swimming during sunset at Ambasamuthiram can transport you to a new world of happiness and the pristine beauty of this place is still front of my eyes. Papanasam can transport you to another world. Simple. Everlasting. Refreshing. Soothing. If you ever want to sit back and watch the nature in awe, then Papanasam is the place. En-route to Agasthiyar Falls, the smaller streams can enlighten your soul. These are purely breathtaking. If you want to get a first hand experience of bliss , experience the twilight at Ambasamuthiram.\n\nIt is water, water everywhere. But, Courtallam is not just about drenching ourselves in the water. It is the journey to the pursuit. The pursuit of happiness! Who can forget the windy mornings while travelling to the Old Falls or the unique Saaral that you would experience during the peak season? If the body has taken enough water-hits, you donot stop. You can taste the sweet Pathaneer (the nutritious beverage) or the rich palm fruit or the refreshing tender coconut water- all of which can cool you further! If your checklist is complete, you can sit back and relax in the hotel balcony and read my 2017 story of the glory of the gushing Courtallam here , which will give you a more holistic information of the place.\n\nBy the time we finish, we always yearn for more. Another repeat visit to the Main & Five Falls would give that feeling of completeness. The trip is never complete without a visit to Kutralanathar temple, located right before the entrance of the Main Falls! This temple is pure divine! You can shuttle to Kasi Viswanathar temple in Tenkasi and come back for the evening shopping in the Courtallam market! But, before you try anything, Stand up and view the awesome temple gopuram beneath the clouds; that is quite a wonder! If you have done with everything, you can try a photo session or make tour diaries. There was one trip last year, in which we went on a roundabout- Trivandram (Kerala) -Tenkasi-Courtallam-Tenmala (Kerala)-Sengottai- Courtallam-Papanasam-Tenkasi. Time will tell if such times can return! I have earmarked Sengottai (which offers Ghee Falls/Nei Aruvi and plenty of private falls), Manjolai (which was closed during my last visit), Banatheertham among other places for my future visits. I will also tell you more when I get to dip in at Adaiviyanar Dam (near Mekkarai) and Theerparappu Waterfalls (Kanniyakumari District) in the near future. Maybe a special approval to go to Shenbagadevi falls (I can get greedy sometimes) and Honey Falls (Thenaruvi) will help me write a book!\n\nBy the time you bid goodbye, you would think back and thank the nature for the unrelenting treat that it has bestowed upon. Despite a massively enjoyable trip, the sense of emptiness would creep in! Yes, the trip is over. I get back to the vehicle with a hope to return next month! I would make alternate plans with family and friends to make the most of the monsoon season! By now, the hotel and restaurant owners are friends with me! They recognize and welcome me every time I check-in. From what was predominantly a once-a-year trip, I started hitting the peak recently by making it thrice-a-year trip.\n\nThe season has begun early this year and the waterfalls are inviting me! So are the trees, Saaral rains, rivers and the winds. And the paradise of steps. And the rainbow. Along with the main falls arc. And the natural pedicure. And the temples. In fact, I can smell the air of Tenkasi sitting here in Chennai. But, because of one unidentifiable virus that came from elsewhere, I must content with the luxury of staying at home! This, I realize, is a luxury, especially in times like these!\n\nI can only pray and keep hoping that I make the cut this year! That trip covering 400 miles to meet the luxury of nature’s shower I crave for! Only the Kutralanathar can turn it around!\n\n-AJAY SRINIVASAN\n\nMy Twitter feed is here:\n\nhttps://twitter.com/Ajaychairman\n\nIf you have missed, my 2017 story of the glory of gushing Courtallam, read it here:\n\nGLORY OF THE GUSHING COURTALLAM\n\nTamil Cinema Blog\n\n-BY AJAY SRINIVASAN\n\nIf you are looking for a perfect blend of a residential area and shopping hub, then Purasawalkam is your automatic pick! Ironically, the term ”Purasai” originated from a tree called “Purasai maram” as this area was copious with this tree variety! Ironically, this area is devoid of greenery today and the streets are always choc-a-bloc! Purasawalkam is one of the oldest areas of Chennai city. It is the nearest residential area when you get down from Chennai Central railway junction. In the Tamil film tinsel town, the catchment areas of Purasawalkam also includes Kilpauk, Ayanavaram, Kellys, Otteri, Aminjikarai,Anna Nagar,Chetpet,Choolaimedu and Nungambakkam. In trade parlence, this conglomeration is technically West Chennai since Kodambakkam can be labelled as South Chennai, North Madras has an obvious identity and Mount Road (my next column) is effectively Central Chennai.\n\nPurasawalkam, is often considered as the signal provider for the entire cinema industry! If a movie is doubtful for release and there is uncertainty over the release, the opening of advance bookings at Abirami Mega Mall is considered as a big green signal for the movie’s release. The highly reputed and influential veteran ‘Abirami’ Ramanathan is the trade’s powerhouse and all roads lead to him for crucial decisions! Even last week, he sprung a surprise to the entire industry by waiving off the most talked about online booking charges in his theatre, which many believe has come from the right person as he heads the Tamil Film Chamber of Commerce. ‘Abirami’ Ramanathan’s pet child- the 4-screen multiplex Abirami Mega Mall– has seen the industry evolve! Abirami complex entered business during early 1970s at a time when the multiplex boom exactly started in Chennai as other powerhouses like Devi & Sathyam also came into the fray! Starting 2007, Abirami took up each screen for renovation and brought up different theme-based theatres. They even introduced a new jorgon in the cinema trade-they called it 7 Star theatre much to the surprise of the movie goers. There is waiter on call to deliver you dinner and there are recliner seats, which can be turned into a bed while you watch your favorite flick! For the last few years, Abirami is often the first theatre to open advance bookings for a biggie; sometimes they open prior to 2 weeks before release! They were also the 1st to stop advance bookings for movies like Vishal’s Madha Gaja Raja and Kamal Hassan’s Vishwaroopam, signaling postoponement. While Abirami is one of the pioneers in sound technology (they installed Dolby sound system even before the release of Kamal Hasan’s Kurudhi Punal-the 1st Tamil film mixed with this sound), today they have the latest Laser projection for their screens. Laser projection is a smart long-term investment that cuts down on operating costs towards projectors lamps! Until re-opening one of their screens post renovation ( they renovated each of their screens one by one to make sure business does not stop), Abirami never released Hindi movies. Their 1st big Hindi release was in Diwali 2007 when they released Shah Rukh Khan’s “Om Shanti Om” in their refurbished Swarna Sakthi Abirami and they even distributed the film in Chennai city! This sent shock waves to especially Ega, which specialized in Hindi films. Ega, therefore released only one film-Saawariya-for that Diwali,missing out on the high profile SRK film! Abirami is also one of the leading distributors in Chennai city. When a successful biggie is distributed by Abirami in Chennai city, Abirami ensures the movie gets red carpet showcasing in their multipllex with maximum shows and they also give the film long run if proved the movie is successful. Be it Rajinikanth’s 2007 blockbuster Sivaji (which had a 175 day run here) or Vijay’s 2012 blockbuster Thuppakki (which had a 100 day run here) or the recent record hit Baahubali2 (which is racing towards 100 days here), successful biggies distributed by Abirami gets long runs here even in today’s short run trend. Interestingly, the theatre has patronage from both fans and family audiences alike. On one hand, they distribute such high profile biggies; on the other hand, they produce and distribute small films like Unnodu Ka. When the crowd cheered and screamed for SivaKarthikeyan after the climax of Ethir Neechal (a 2013 sports dramedy entertainer) at the big screen Abirami 7Star, you know the star has arrived. “Abirami had houseful boards for all films on all days during the summer of 1999. Be it Rajinikanth’s Padaiappa (action drama) or Vijay’s Thullatha Manamum Thullum (romantic drama) or Ajith’s Vaali (romantic thriller), it was a blockbuster summer at Abirami. Unless you have a pre-booked ticket, it was impossible to get in” re-collects Mohammad,a movie buff in Chennai. Starting from Dharmadurai in 1991, Abirami never missed a single Rajinikanth film till date! The amazing list includes Thalapathi,Mannan,Annamalai,Pandiyan,Yejaman,Uzhaipalli,Vaali,Veera,Baasha,Muthu,Arunachalam,Padaiappa,Baba,Chandramukhi,Sivaji,Kuselan,Endhiran,Kochadaiiyan,Lingaa & Kabali. From the early 1990s, they ensured not to miss out on a single Ranjinikanth film, which is an unbelievable feat! Abirami is also a stronghold for Kamal Haasan. For example: Thenali collected Rs 1,50,61,872 in 6 weeks from 5 screens in Chennai city, with Abirami contributing around 25% share. Post-renovation, Abirami 7Star has a seat capacity of 809 seats, Swarna Sakthi Abirami has 348 seats, Sree Annai Abirami has 354 seats and Robot Bala Abirami has 272 seats.\n\nAbirami’s nearest rival-Sangam Cinemas-is around 2 km away at Kilpauk. Sangam, by design, tries to replicate Sathyam cinemas by creating similar lobby, trained staff,elite concession counters etc. They are less cramped when compared to Abirami Mega Mall and they have couple seating in all their 3 screens. Sometimes, Sangam tries to pick elitist movies to give it a posh feel! In every possible way, Sangam tries to be different from Abirami! Common man often believed that if you create a war field in Chennai city, you would pit these 2 theatres against each other! In 2007, when ‘Abirami’ Ramanathan distributed Rajinikanth’s Sivaji in Chennai city, he brought in a new revolution. More prints were created, almost every release centre played the movie and unheard no.of shows were allotted! In the Kodambakkam area, Udhayam, Kamala & AVM Rajeswari played the movie while in Mount Road, it released in all major release centres- Sathyam,Devi,Albert and Melody. This kind of wide showcasing never happened before. But, in Purasawalkam area, Abirami simply monopolized it! While they played the Rajinikanth blockbuster in all 4 screens at Abirami; they did not give a single show to Sangam! Sangam reciprocated when they started distributing movies like Vijay Sethupathy’s Pizza (Ironically, Vijay Sethupathy lives in Kilpauk) by retaining monopoly this time! The cat and mouse game followed when superhits Kalakalappu and Kumki were not released at Abirami when only Sangam played it exclusively ! Today, all this practice is stopped as every film gets released everywhere as the distributor wants to make the maximum from the 1st weekend! In 2007, Ajith’s superhit Billa set the trend when it got screened at both Abirami & Sangam multiplexes-a new first in this area! Sangam recently installed Dolby Atmos sound system to keep pace with the trend and changed their balcony seating! During the practice of restricted release, Sangam generally picked urban centric movies. Kamal Hassan’s Vassol Raja MBBS, Vijay’s Kushi, Ajith’s Kreedom, Suriya’s Kaakha Kaakha to name a few. Re-collects Rakesh Jeevraj: “When I went to watch Madhavan’s Run in 2002, I could get tickets at Sangam for the 1st weekend by just walking in before the show. I took my friends next weekend for repeat watch and the long queues started from the roads to the ticket counter. We went back home without tickets and did an advance booking for the next day. I was stunned”. The Madhavan blockbuster picked up post terrific word-of-mouth and no wonder the urban centic romantic film was a thumping hit at Sangam. With big audis, Dolby Atmos, couple seating and affordable pricing of tickets, Sangam is an unique 3-screen complex in Chennai. Sangam, Padmam and DLounge (previously known as Roobam prior to 3D installation) are its 3 screens. Screen Roobam was mostly reserved for Malayalam movies in the 1990s.\n\nThe screen allotment of Abirami & Sangam have always called for interesting reading! For example: For 1991 Diwali when Rajinikanth’s Thalapathi clashed with Kamalhassan’s Guna, Abirami had allocated their big screen Abirami to Thalapathi and compensated with 2 smaller screens-Sakthi Abirami & Annai Abirami to Guna. The trend is prevalent even today. Have you noticed in Pongal 2014, when Vijay’s Jilla clashed with Ajith’s Veeram, Abirami mall did a similar scheduling? Vijay’s Jilla was given the Abirami big screen and Ajith’s Veeram was compensated with 2 screens-Sakthi & Annai Abirami. Few year back during Pongal 2007 when the same two superstars were pitted against each other, Abirami screened the Vijay blockbuster Pokkiri while Ajith’s Aalwar was screened at Sangam. During Tamil New Year 2005, when Tamil cinema witnessed the mother of all clashes, the programming at Purasawakam was full of excitement. Rajinikanth’s Chandramukhi-the blockbuster horror comedy– was given the Abirami big screen while Sakthi & Annai screens were given to Kamal Haasan’s off-beat comedy Mumbai Express while their 4th screen Bala Abirami was playing Vijay’s Pongal blockbuster Thirupachi – a rural based action potboiler-to 100 days along with a new release called Sevvel. Vijay’s Tamil New Year release Sachein- an urban centric romantic comedy-grabbed the big screen at Sangam Cinemas thereby the screen allotment for all the 3 biggies made the distributors and fans happy. In mid-June after the summer releases settled down, Sangam big screen played Shankar-Vikram’s blockbuster Anniyan, thereby the screen allotments ensured both Abirami & Sangam remained busy.\n\nIn the same street of Sangam, there is Ega Cinemas, the 2-screen complex which is considered as Chennai’s Bollywood hub! Be it the crowd pulling Khan films or off-beat films like Amithab Bachan’s Paa or Ranbhir Kapoor’s Burfi or lesser known films like Meri Pyaari Bindu, there is hardly a Hindi release which misses Ega. For the past 2-3 years, Ega is also accommodating big Tamil releases as the Tamil distributors wants every screen in the city for big opening numbers! Interestingly, Ega’s seating resembles that of Devi and their 2nd screen Anu Ega is equipped with the Auro 3D sound system! Reputed entertainment industry tracker and senior film critic Sreedhar Pillai had tweeted in February 2014: “Visited the renovated Anu Ega. They have converted their old projector room into a 38-seater Balcony! Comfy leg space, but have to climb 3 floors”. Sreedhar tweeted after he saw Vikramadithyan at Anu Ega post renovation for a noon show also attended by some Kollywood assistants! One would also recall the 1990 evergreen blockbuster-Karagakattakaran-which ran for 365 days in Ega! People kept visiting the theatre for the hugely popular Goundamani-Senthil comedy and they laughed out eveytime they saw the movie. Apart from screening such rare Tamil films, Ega, as most people know, screens only Hindi movies and Malayalam movies. Can you believe that in today’s bubble run trend, Bangalore Days- a 2014 feel-good Malayalam blockbuster-ran for 100 days at Ega? “Rain in Chennai followed by rain in celluloid” the author of this article described after returning home from the pleasant movie. Yours Truly could recollect the fact that Chennai witnessed pleasant rains that day followed by a plesant picture. In fact, after completing 50 days, Ega increased Bangalore Days showcount to daily 4 shows, which is unbelievable! The interesting pattern at Ega is that the same set of people keeps visiting Ega every week! Some movie goers are friends with the ticket counter staff while some are friends with local vendors. “I personally know a lot of people visiting Ega. They come here every week and if I don’t see some of my regulars, I feel missed and I ask them next week” says a road side vendor, who sells tasty groundnut masala mixed with raw mangoes, carrots, onions and spices outside the theatre! Amit Singh Arora, one of his customers tells me: “Yes. And he adds a sprinkle of lemon; that delivers a mouth watering snack” In 1997, Sharukh Khan’s Yes Boss has a stupendous run at Ega. Tickets were priced at Rs 20 then!\n\nA 5-minute drive from Ega will take you to Ampa Skywalk, where the 7 screen PVR Multiplex made its debut in Chennai! Interestingly, the area, where this mall building is stationed, was considered a bad luck area. Until the advent of Ampa Skywalk, all establishments (Arun Hotel or Windsor Park, to name a few) functioned here flunked and hence the mall authorities were able to invest in the city without burning their pockets! Fortunately, advent of this new mall gave Chennai a new multiplex in 2010 and the city welcomed a new multiplex after a long time! The best thing at PVR Cinemas is that super hits generally get a longer run here when compared to other theatres! In fact, when the multiplex opened, one of their 1st releases Vinnaithandi Varuvaya-the romantic urban superhit from Goutham Menon- had a 100-day run here! In 2012, Vijay’s Pongal superhit Nanban ran here for 100 days and was continued even after the television premiere! Even recently, Samuthirakani’s Appa- a low budget film- completed 75 days here! It helps that the multiplex is surrounded by areas like Anna Nagar,Kilpauk,Aminjikarai and Arumbakkam, which are all large areas with hefty population. This means there will be good influx of people on any given day. “7am Arivu was a Diwali release; but my apartment neighbours were seeing it for the 1st time at PVR on New year’s Day. This is quite unbelievable to me” says Subramanian from Arumbakkam. PVR at Aminjikarai is considered as a total urban-pro centre as it caters to posh localities like Anna Nagar and hence the multiplex-centric urban films do very well here. PVR is famous for the comfortable luxury seats and wide leg space, which is a big hit from the time they opened in Chennai! The 7-screen multiplex screens movies from all languages and all genres. Movies like “Robinson Crusoe” or “One Night Stand”, which does not gets released elsewhere gets screeed here. In September 2016, PVR Skywalk did a new first in Chennai. They released a Bengali movie Shaheb Bibi Golam (for 11 AM shows on weekend only) giving the minority Bengali population in Chennai something to cheer about! The audience in this multiplex is known to be a knowledgeable unit. For example, in 2011, Vikram’s classical hit Deiva Thirumagal converted the auditorium into a sea of emotions. After emoting at right junctures of the film, everyone in the crowd gave a standing ovation after the climax. Some left with moist eyes, some left with deep thoughts but none of them were on their seats when the crowd rose up for the ovation. The success of their Aminjikarai property has in fact motivated them to invest in 2 more locations in Chennai-Velachery & Tirusulam.\n\nDuring Diwali 2011, when Redgiant movies had pre-booked all big screens in Chennai for Suriya’s 7am Arivu, Aascar Films did a new first in this area. To cope up with the intense battle of screens, he screened Vijay hit Velayudham in every release station of West Chennai-Abirami,Sangam,Ega,Motcham and PVR. Currently, the only single-screen cinema that is functioning in this area is Otteri Mahalakshmi. They mostly screen the yesteryear classics of Sivaji Ganesan. At a time when satellite television is at its peak, watching Sivaji Ganesan classics on big screen is a unique facility for the people around this area. The legacy theatres- Roxy,Mekala, Motcham, Saraswathi, Bhuvaneswari, Vasanthi, Saravana, ‘Strahans Road’ Lakshmi and Thirumagal (all at Purasawalkam), Uma (at Kellys), Gopikrishna, Nataraj,Ashok and Sayani (all at Ayanavaram), Lakshmi, Palaniappa and Muralikrishna (all at Aminjikarai), Nataraj (Choolaimedu) and Grand theatre (Anna Nagar) have all shut shop!\n\nInterestingly, Anna Nagar till today, despite being a big area in Chennai city, does not have a single movie hall! Experts tell me that this is because the highly affluent people never visited cinema in the 1990s as they preferred to watch in VCRs at home due to lack of proper amenities in theatres and from early 2000s, it became impossible to invest in a plot and construct a theatre in Anna Nagar! In fact, the residents tell me that but for the bad luck sentiment in the area, Skywalk itself would have never happened! Some deep research and conversation with the locals made me realize that a theatre called “Grand theatre” did exist in Anna Nagar and this cinema, that no longer exists, was the only one in Anna Nagar. Aminjikarai Lakshmi (not to be confused with ‘Strahans Road’ Lakshmi at Purasaiwalkam or ‘Red Hills’ Lakshmi or ‘Pallavaram’ Lakshmi or ‘Sri Lakshmi Cinemas Thiruninravur) is famous for re-runs; they generally bring in superhits after the movie completes 100 days elsewhere. In 2007, Vijay’s blockbuster Pokkiri had a 100-day re-run here after it was brought to this theatre as a shifting release post the movie’s 100-day run. This was a new record that was previously owned by Rajinikanth’s Annamalai in 1992, which had a similar distinction of having a 100-day run at Lakshmi, releasing after its original 100-day run in release centres! Sadly, such concepts and this theatre have stepped into oblivion today! At a stone throw’s away from Aminjikarai Lakshmi, there was Muralikrishna, another non-A/c theatre famous for re-runs. Today, Muralikrishna has given way to a marriage hall, a more lucrative option in Chennai today. Aminjikarai also had another single screen named Palaniappa, which screened movies like Oru Oodhappu Kan Simuttikirathu, which didn’t needed big MGs. “During my college days at DG Vaishnav Arumbakkam, there was no notable multiplex in the nearby areas like Aminjikarai,Anna Nagar,Arumbakkam,Nungambakkam etc. When we bunked college, we had to travel a lot to watch a Friday release, which we considered a bane” says Ganesh, who graduated from DG Vaishnav in the early 2000s.\n\nPurasawalkam, has a history of abundant single-screen presence and all of them are not in today’s cinema map. One of them is Roxy, which was famous for screening English films till the 1980s. Roxy, previously known as Globe theatre, was a landmark in this area from 1918. For the Hollywood movie fans and the Anglo-Indian settlements, Roxy was the one-stop destination. Roxy also screened Tamil films like Server Sundaram to the delight of Tamil audience here. Mekala, a mass single-screen cinema, served as the prime release centre for Tamil biggies. Yesteryear superstar M.G.Ramachandran’s blockbusters like Ayirathil Oruvan, Anbey Vaa, Kaavalkaran, Adimai Penn, Thali Baghyam, Enga Veetu Pillai had dream runs at Mekala with fans going berserk on the day of release. Enga Veetu Pillai, for instance, re-wrote all records at Mekala. It collected Rs 3,61,293 from 176 days at Mekala. After the huge success of Enga Veetu Pillai, when M.G.R. was considering entry into politics, he signed up with Reddy to remake a Telugu hit Kathanayakudu,which was made as “Nam Naadu” in Tamil. When Nam Naadu released, both Reddy and M.G.R. went to Mekala theatre to watch the reaction of the viewers. There was a scene in which MGR was being welcomed after his victory in the elections. The audience were screaming, clapping and whistling and asked the theatre owner to repeat the mass scene. The director advised the theatre operator to oblige. The scene was repeated by the theatre, the whistles tripled and MGR’s eyes were filled with tears of joy. The superstar (or Makkal Thilagam, as he is celebrated) hugged the director and said: “O Reddiar! I have received people’s acceptance”. Bhuvaneswari (not to be confused with Tirukazhukundram Bhuvaneswari), on the other hand, was a fortress for Sivaji Ganesan movies. Be it the devotional cult classic Thiruvilayadal or the evergreen musical drama Thillana Mohanambal or the legal fiction Gouravam or the triple delight Thirisulam, Bhuvaneswari theatre played host to around 35-40 Sivaji Ganesan movies. Bharathiraja’s landmark movie 16 Vayadhinile starring Kamal Haasan and Rajinikanth had a marathon run at Bhuvaneswari. Saraswathi theatre, another single screen in Purasawalkam, was a regular release centre for Tamil biggies. Recollects Vasudevan, a huge fan of Gemini Ganesan, who saw Then Nilavu 27 times at Saraswathi: “When Gemini Ganesan sang “Pattu Padava Parthu Pesava” in “Then Nilavu”, the audience sang along with him. Those days, there were no YouTube downloads, no internet, no 24-hour music channels, no FM stations, no ‘Pepsi’ Ungal Choice, no satellite television, no Olliyum Oliyum, no Doordarshan. The craze was too high that we saw “Then Nilavu” at Saraswathi 12 times to celebrate this song and 15 more times for Gemini Ganesan and Kashmir localions” . The picturesque Kashmir locales shown in the movie was a big hit among the residents of Purasawalkam at that time and they flocked to Bhuvaneswari every day! Vasudevan is elated and starts singing while narrating the experience: “Angamellam thangamana mangaiyai pole; nadhi anna nadai poduthamma boomiyin mela! kanniraintha kadhalanai kanavillaya; intha kadhalikku then nilavil aasai illaya…..” At Madras, Gemini Ganesan’s Then Nilavu-a romantic comedy- released at Casino (Mount Road), Prabath (North Madras) and Saraswathi (Purasaiwalkam) and was a blockbuster! As Vasudevan continues: “Pakkamaga Vantha Pinnum Vetkam Aaguma, Inge Paarvayodu Paarvai Saera Thoothu Venduma.Maalai Allavaa Nalla Naeram Allavaa; Innum Vaanam Paartha Boomi Pola Vaazhalaaguma”, we let him enjoy his evening and move on to Ramamoorthy, who has moved to a spacious apartment in Chrompet today. Sitting in an oonjal (a swing that is typically anchored to the ceiling using iron chains with a wooden seat) at his Chrompet residence, Ramamoorthy and his wife recollects watching movies at screens like Vasanthi, Balaji, Saravana, ‘Strahans Road’ Lakshmi and Thirumagal- all located at the heart of Purasawalkam. “Until retirement, we were residing at Purasawalkam. Tickets were priced so cheap at theatres like Vasanthi,Saravana,Balaji,Lakshmi and Thirumagal. We remember carrying murukku and watching movies in these theatres” says Ramamoorthy with a big nod from his wife as both of them recollect their movie watching days. We call-up Saravanan, who is in his mid-30s to get a taste of the younger generation who still misses Motcham Cinemas,a 2 screen property at Purasaiwalkam.“Every Friday night and Saturday night, watching a dubbed English movie at Motcham was our weekly tradition. This weekly entertainment dose is missed today” says Saravanan, an office-boy, who works for an IT company in Nungambakkam. “The Jackie Chan stunts, Hollywood heroes talking Tamil, cheap ticketing, cool drinks. Where are they today”; asks Saravanan, who could not control his emotions as Motcham closed down recently. True to Saravanan’s words, Motcham was the preferred destination for dubbed English movies in Chennai. Motcham had 2 screens-Motcham and Mini Motcham.\n\nAyanavaram, a major area in the Purasawalkam catchment area, also had a cluster of single-screens. Sayani was considered as a stronghold for Sivaji Ganesan movies. His evergreen blockbusters- Veerapandiya Kattabomman (biographical war film), Kappalottiya Thamizhan (drama), Pudhiya Paravai (romantic thriller) and Vidivelli (investigative thriller), to name a few- were screened here. Can you imagine the overseas premiere of the cult classic Veerapandiya Kattabomman was held in London on 10 May 1959 before its Tamilnadu theatrerical release on 16 May 1959? Recollects Varadharajan, a retired government employee, whose best decision was to watch Pudhiya Paravai at Sayani: “We used to go to cinema after reading reviews from Anandha Vikadan; we were apprehensive about Pudhiya Paravai as Vikatan wrote that it is an intellectual film and it is emotionally tough to accept the climax. We went ahead and saw it Sayani and it remains one of my favorite films till date” Lalitha, a fan of comedy films, recollects watching Sivaji Ganesan’s comedy film Galatta Kalyanam at Sayani. “Still remember the scene when a census officer was mis-understood as a vigilance officer which had the theatre in splits. Cho’s comic timing, in particular, was completely hilarious”. Another theatre close by is Nataraj theatre, which had a bus stand named after it in Elephant Gate St, Thattankulam, Periyamet. Nataraj was a preferred destination for Hindi films in this area and it gave way to apartments today. The Hindi population in Periamet, George Town, Kiplauk, Chetpet, Purasaiwalkam and Ayanavaram considered Nataraj as their favorite theatre for watching Hindi films. Ashok theatre, another single screen in Ayanavaram was also famous for Hindi films. Bollywood blockbusters like Anarkali were screend here. In short, Nataraj and Ashok were Bollywood bastions before the advent of Ega. In the middle of so many single screens, Ayanavaram is also famous for a popular 3-screen cineplex called Gopikrishna. They had 3 screens-Gopikrishna, Radha, Rukmani. All the 3 screens are big sized 70 MM screens with large capacity seating. In the recent times, the theatre used to open only when big movies get released with online booking at BookMyshow and then they close again. Residents say the major issues here are sore seating, unclean lobby and lousy ambiance and if they renovate well, it will be a big hit among the family audience. Gopikrishna did some namesake renovation and branded it Gopikrishna Paradise. When fans could not get tickets in other theatres, Gopikrishna rakes in the moolah during the opening weekend adding into the opening collection numbers of biggies!\n\nKellys, a neighbourhood near Kilpauk, was famous for Uma theatre. Re-collects Padmavathi, who lived in a women’s hostel in Chetpet in the 1970s: “I worked as a teacher and stayed at a hostel in Chetpet. Taking a bus to Kellys to watch latest movies at Uma is an experience I still cherish. Cinema was the only entertainment and audience at Uma used to give standing ovation if the movie is really good. In fact, the area Kellys was used to be identified from Uma theatre and many people had no reason to visit Kellys but for Uma theatre. Continues Padmavathi: “I take back memories of watching MGR hits (like Ulagam Suttrum Vaaliban, Ithayakani, Uzhaikum Karangal etc.) while my seniors used to tell me the stupendous run of classics like Sivaji Ganesan’s Paalum Pazhamum, Paarthal Pasi Theerum (a multi-starrer starring Sivaji Ganesan & Gemini Ganesan) at Uma”. Her senior was right; the 1962 Pongal blockbuster Paarthal Pasi Theerum had stupendous run at 3 release centres in Madras- Shanti (Mount Road), SriKrishna (North Madras) and Uma (Purasawalkam). In the movie, there is a dialogue between Gemini Ganesan and Sivaji Ganesan which goes Gemini weeping: “Indira, Intha paaviya parka kudathunu ippo kurudaitiya. Thaavi odiya maana iruntha nee; ippo thadumari vizhariya” after which Sivaji Ganesan hugs Gemini Ganesan and consoles him. The audience cried with them. People tell me such emotional connect last happened during the screening of Sivaji Ganesan’s cult classic Paalum Pazhamum in 1961.\n\nTheatres in the boundary of this geography (like AGS Villivakkam, Kolathur Ganga, Koyambedu Rohini) comes under Chengelpet territory.Thanks to multiplexes like Abirami, Sangam, PVR & Ega, Purasawalkam area has not fallen down like North Madras (detailed here); but the industry feels the growth did not proliferate like Kodambakkam area (analysed here). Somewhere down the line, a major multiplex in Anna Nagar will give this area a complete feel! Surely, Ayanavaram deserves to have atleast one movie complex and therefore if Gopikrishna can refurbish itself, it can do wonders at Ayanavaram. The new metro rail, with stations at Kilpauk, Shenony Nagar etc. gives this area better connectivity! My next column will talk about the prestigious Mount Road area and until then sip your hot tea, munch your favorite snack and re-visit my previous articles here. Or you can sing the evergreen Gemini Ganesan melody, which goes: “Kanniraintha Kadhalanai Kanavillayaa; intha Kadhalikku Then Nilavil Aasai illaya? Kadhal Thondruma, innum kalam poguma; illai kaathu kaathu nindrathuthan meetham aaguma?” Tata.\n\n-AJAY SRINIVASAN\n\nMy Twitter feed is here: https://twitter.com/Ajaychairman\n\nTamil Cinema Blog\n\nArticle by Ajay Srinivasan\n\nNorth Madras, which originated with the founding of an East India company factory in the village of Madrasapatnam, is one of the oldest areas in Chennai city. To be more precise, the Madras city (now Chennai) was born out of this area. In fact, the eminent Madras slang emerged from this area. Rest of the Tamil Nadu population identified Madras from this area only. Today, the flavor of Chennai has changed as the city has grown southwards and the North Madras became a neglected area. Today, people living in posh areas like Alwarpet or Besant Nagar would have not even visited North Madras in their lifetime. The area is generally notorious for its thick population, narrow roads and deprived infrastructure. Tamil Cinema, however at times, tried showing to rest of the world that North Chennai is also Chennai. It is next to impossible to live-shoot a movie in this area due to the density of population; mostly the filmmakers resort to sets. Whenever a director wants to talk about gangsters or squeeze in a ghana song, North Madras continues to be the answer! It is interesting that the movies shot with the North Madras background has proved lucky for most actors. For example, the 2003 Diwali super hit Thirumalai, where Vijay pulls cigarette from his shirt collar on the streets of Pudhupettai, not only gave him the much-needed comeback at the box-office but also helped him get the coveted action-hero image. Very recently, the North-Madras based sports film-Irudhi Suttru, bestowed a stirring comeback for Madhavan. In fact, Ritika Singh, the female lead of Irudhi Suttru played Dhanush’s fan in the movie exemplifying the reach of Dhanush in the North Madras heartland. Ever since he danced for “Enga Area Ulla Varadhey” in Selvaraghavan’s Pudhupettai, a neo-noir gangster film based in North Madras, Dhanush ensured he always stayed connected with the North Madras audience. Remember his Kaali role in Anegan (specifically the peppy “Danga Maari Oodhari” number) or the recent gangster flick Maari? Interestingly, the 2015 Diwali super hit Vedalam, where Ajith played a North Madras local don, not only proved lucky at the box-office but also helped him to reach the much-needed family audience. My article on the Kodambakkam area was published earlier; while I will exclusively focus on Purasawalkam and Mount Road areas in the coming weeks. To start with, North Madras audience has seen it all.\n\nThe theatres in North Madras have mirrored the saturation of real estate and the neglection of development that the area is known for. The area’s stagnated growth mirrors the lack of multiplexes and closing of many famous single screens. Two streets in this area were called cinema streets as theatres were located one after the other in these roads. One is the Broadway/Mint street- consisting of Broadway,Prabath,Minerva,Murugan (Kinema Central),Crown ,Srikrishna and Idream (in MS Kovil street). The other is T.H. Road-consisting of Bharath,Maharani,MM Theatre,Agastya,TamilNadu,Thangam,Pandian (Maharaja) and Regal (Padmanabha). There are also Tiruvottiyur screens-MSM,Odeon Mani,Manickam (now defunct) and Meenakshi-which technically falls in Chengalpattu area of Tamil film distribution zone! While many of the screens in North Madras have perished, some of them have renovated and kept pace with time! For abundant clarity, in the Tamil film distribution language, Royapuram, Tondiarpet, Washermenpet, Kurukkupet,Mint, Kasimedu, George Town, Sowcarpet, Pudhupettai, Paris, Broadway and Perambur (read further to know why Perambur is considered in North Chennai) are part of Chennai city while Tiruvottiyur, Manali, Ennore and the northern suburbs falls under Chengalpattu.\n\nThere would be no justice to my writing if I do not dwell upon the renowned history of North Madras cinema. Haridass, the 1944 classic, has the distinction of running for 3 continuous Diwali (1944-46) at Broadway theatre, the oldest theatre in this area located in George Town. Despite being engulfed with rich history, Boradway cinema had to merely become history 5 years back! However, this is not the only theatre that has shut shop in the last 2 decades. Prabath theatre, which was located on the same street, gave way to an apartment. “It is painful to see another structure in the place where I witnessed Sivaji Ganesan’s Karnan” says Chakrapani, a retired man who narrates the experience of seeing Karnan at Prabath. He continues: “Post-climax of Karnan, people sitting in my row had moist eyes and we hugged at each other”. The Sivaji Ganesan blockbuster had silver jubilee run at 3 release centres in Chennai city- Shanti (Mount Road), Prabath (North Madras) and Sayani (Purasawakam).\n\nLocals tell me that Mahatma Gandhi had visited Murugan Talkies (formerly known as Kinema Central, which was previously known as Majestic), a George Town single-screen that no longer exists! Today, the high-end multiplexes in rest of the areas of Chennai city, are thriving by creating revolution in sound technology (like installing Dolby Atmos, Auro 3D etc.). But, Kinema Central created revolution in 1930s itself when it played host to the 1st ever sound film to release in South India! It was in 1931 when Kinema Central created history when it released the 1st ever Tamil-Telugu talkie movie Kalidas. When the film reels were brought to Madras, the fans welcomed it with rose petals and carried the reels of the film from the Central railway station to the theatre. Struck with the novelty of witnessing the first ever audio-visual film, audience from all over the state congregated to this theatre! When K.B.Sundarambal’s Avvaiyar released here in 1953, the fans broke coconuts and lit camphor! Murugan Talkies had run classics like MGR’s debut film Sathi Leelavathi, Thyagabhoomi (the historical classic released during the Indian Freedom movement), Shakunthala etc. In 1937, the yesteryear superstar Thyagaraja Bhagavathar’s Chinthamani ran for 3 years in this cinema, which was then known as Kinema Central.\n\nSriKrishna, another single-screen in Mint Street, considered a hub for M.G.R and Sivaji Ganesan movies, has also sadly gone into oblivion. From Nadodi Mannan to Ayirathil Oruvan and Anbe Vaa, several M.G.R. blockbusters were celebrated here. In 1958, MGR’s blockbuster Nadodi Mannan had a dream run in 3 screens in Chennai city namely Paragon (Mount Road), Srikrishna (North Madras) and Uma (Purasawalkam).\n\nNorth Madras, is famous for the bus stops named after theatres. There was always a gentle mirth among the passengers as the conductor used to say “Maharaja, get down and Maharani, get down” when the buses pass through screens like Maharaja and Maharani. Maharaja, in Tiruvottiyur High Road (T.H.Road), is the older name for the better-known Pandian theatre, which has also disappeared from the North Madras map! Pandian is famous for showcasing many new movies including Vijayakanth hits- Vasantha Ragam, Pulan Visaranai to name a few.\n\nThe fate of the theatres in North Chennai can be perfectly correlated to the stagnation and neglection of this place. For example: Until 1950s, North Madras was also the commercial and business center of the city. Today, it is the least preferred option for the posh business units. Compare this with the fate of Tamilnadu theatre in Tondaiarpet. Tamil Nadu theatre, famous for running English movies, was an A/c movie hall in the 1960s at a time when A/c was considered a luxury for a movie theatre. Today, when you have centralized A/Cs in all the theatres, Tamilnadu theatre has become just another theatre to shut shop in North Madras! 1 km away from this theatre, there was also Thangam theatre, which is now the most preferred marriage hall in North Chennai thanks to the ample car parking space it provides, a rarity in T.H.Road. Crown, a well-known single screen in Georgetown, also joined the list of theatres to shut down. From being a proud Rajinikanth bastion in 1980s, Crown has somehow lost its relevance and disappeared from the North Madras map! “In 1994, Crown remained a strong release centre releasing popular films like Rajinkanth’s Veera. From early 2000s, it started getting only the least preferred movies and then slowly shut down” says Viswanathan, who resides at Mint. Padmanabha theatre (earlier known as Regal theatre), the history of which can be traced to the days of silent films, also does not exist today! Minerva theatre (now renamed as Baasha) is surviving on thin rope as it now plays old movies that are repeated a hundred times on satellite television. The irony is that Minerva is the 1st screen with A/c facility in this area; now this is the only screen where A/c is not in working condition!\n\nWithout considering the SPI multiplex S2 Perambur (stationed on the border of North Chennai), there are hardly 4-5 proper release centers currently in North Chennai. No other area in Chennai city still maintains the single-screen culture like North Madras. Today, Idream, Bharath, Maharani and MM Theatre are the major release stations. Agastya, which was a release station earlier, is now reduced to a mere shifting center for most films. Interestingly, Agastya and MM theatre are the only two theatres that hosts a balcony in the present-day North Chennai.\n\nIdream, the newest single screen in this area, is the most preferred cinema in this territory. With good sound system and cushioned seats, Idream is a multiplex-style single screen and a panacea for the family audience living near Royapuram, Washermenpet and Tondiarpet. When this theatre took over the property of old Brighton cinema (which used to release Jamesbond movies in the 1970s) and constructed a new-age cinema hall, it was considered a bliss to the North Madras neighborhood. The ticket pricing of Idream is itself a dream for many theatres. Today, they have 5 different ticket slabs- Rs 10,30,50,90 & 120 catering to all kinds of people. Says Ravichandran from Royapuram: “I remember my grand-father narrating his experience of watching English movies in sofa-like seats at Brighton. I feel nostalgic when I now watch a latest movie at Idream, which has replaced Brighton. I can tell my grand-children about my stories of watching movies at Idream because Idream is currently the best cinema in this locality”. From showcasing the movies of Montgomery Clift, James Dean, Elizabeth Taylor and Clint Eastwood, Brighton was a Hollywood bastion then. The present-day Idream Cinema, has also motivated other North Madras screens to renovate and revamp.\n\nFor example, Bharath, which served as a Rajinikanth hub for a long time, renovated with Dolby Atmos sound and 4K projections. Be it the children-based Raja Chinna Roja or a typical masala entertainer like Rajathi Raja or a family entertainer like Mappilai or an action blockbuster like Annamalai, Bharath never generally misses Rajinikanth films. It is apt that today, they renovated with latest technology and re-opened for Rajinikanth’s Kabali in 2016. There was an unwritten rule that if a Rajinikanth movie was not given to Bharath, it will go to Crown! Apart from the regular celebrations,special arc is famous for Rajinikanth releases at Bharath! “I remember the crowd going berserk when Vikram opened the beer bottle and mixed it with Idli before the opening fight sequence in Saamy” says Suresh from Mint who has witnessed many Vikram hits at Bharath!\n\nA trip to North Madras will tell you that Maharani, a Washermenpet single-screen, has a name board written in 3 languages- Tamil, English and Telugu! For a South Chennai resident, it will even give you a feel of reaching Andhra border! There was a time when Maharani used to release Telugu movies for noon shows only on weekdays! The theatre, is now fully airconditioned with online ticketing, thereby staying relevant in the market. Says Prasanna from Adyar: “I live in Adyar; but simply for the novelty, I travelled all the way to Washermenpet to watch Suriya’s Ayyan at Maharani. Those days, I didn’t have google maps in my pockets. When I used to ask auto-drivers the route to reach Washermenpet, they used to tell me there is no place like that in Chennai. Then, I realized I should rather ask for Wannarapettai”. The decibel levels at Maharani were at its peak when the fans screamed during the release of Ajith’s Billa in 2007. The crowd got more vociferous during the FDFS of Mangatha in 2011.\n\nWithin 1 km radius, there is Agastya theatre, in Tondairpet, which is one of the biggest auditoriums in the city. Agastya can house close to 1000 people with a big 70 MM screen and traditional Dolby Digital sound system. Be it Rasigan or Priyamudan or Kushi or Pokkiri, Agastya was considered a Vijay stronghold showcasing several Vijay blockbusters during several stages of his career. In the older days, it was a hub for M.G.R. movies. An M.G.R. fan will reminisce watching M.G.R. blockbusters like Ulagam Suttrum Vaaliban or Kavalkaran, which had long runs at Agastya. Later, Agastya went on to become a fortress for Kamal Haasan movies. Be it the cult classic Abborva Sagothargal or the epic drama Thevar Magan, a Kamal fan will tell you his cherished memories at Agastya! The traditional theatre even installed Dolby sound system for Kamal Haasan’s Kurudhipunal. Today, the theatre no longer gets a new release as they refused to renovate. In fact, there is a famous saying about this theatre, which goes: “Agastya has everything that is required of a theatre except A/c”. It is for this reason that once a most-sought-after theatre has now become the least-sought-after theatre. For example, Vijay’s 2004 summer blockbuster Ghilli had a direct release and a 150-day run here. But, today, Vijay’s 2016 summer blockbuster Theri was shifted to this theatre only on the 100th day of the release after the movie finished 99 day run at the multiplexes! Says Murali Boopathy, a resident of North Madras: “Agastya, is still running only because for the sake of workers (like security, operators, ticket men etc.) who have worked in this theatre for more than 30 years. Personally, I know the ticket issuing person in this theatre for the last 30 years! He is a M.S.C. Mathematics graduate, who started his career as a ticket issuing worker and has literally lived in this theatre for 30 years.” Residents say that if Agastya is renovated with A/c and replaces the seats, the theatre will be even better than their best screen Idreams; but the management does not seem to be too interested in the business.\n\nImmediately next to Agastya, there is the popular MM Theatre, which has smartly renovated and is still staying the race, releasing new movies. The USP of this theatre is that this is the only screen in North Chennai with couple seating! In fact, it is only one of the 3-4 screens in the entire Chennai city, that has couple seating! Emulating today’s trend, they have renovated their seats and sound system recently, which helps them to remain a prime theatre in this area. MM Theatre, is considered a fortress for Vijay especially in his early career. Blockbusters like Kadhalukku Mariyadhai, Ninaithen Vanthai or Thullatha Manamum Thullum had long runs here. Celebrations like bursting of crackers and the large sized cut-outs are common whenever Vijay films released in Idream, Agastya and MM. Says Nikhil Bolangadi, who was a North Chennai resident before moving to South: “I still remember watching Thullatha Manamum Thullum at MM with my grandma in 1999 when we took a rickshaw to the theatre. The emotions (both from the movie and the theatre) are still fresh and nostalgic as a rickshaw trip to a cinema is unfathomable today”. Be it the tram trips to Odeon theatre or the rickshaw rides to MM theatre or the cab drops to Idream, North Madras has seen it all! Today, underground metro will shortly open in this zone making the area easily accessible. The EMU railheads and the MRTS railheads of Chennai Fort and Chennai Beach ensures good connectivity. The biggest of them all-Chennai Central railway station, which is the prime railway gateway to Chennai-is close to this zone.\n\nThe best thing that has happened to North Chennai cinema is the opening of a 5 screen SPI property S2 Perambur, at the Spectrum Mall. Incidentally, this is the area where the old Venus theatre (known for playing re-runs) was situated. Perambur residents will be quick to point out that Perambur is not exactly North Chennai and hence my argument needs re-classification. The point is that Perambur is in the border of North Chennai separating the north from the western neighborhood. Given the population and location, Perambur is often considered a sub-area in the area. This can be understood by the practice prevalent during the early days, when movies used to release in 1 screen in each of the 4 areas (Mount Road, Kodambakkam, Purasawalkam and North Madras). Even during those days, some movies used to get a 5th release station called Perambur Sribrinda. Today, S2 Cinemas plays movies from different languages-Tamil,English,Hindi,Telugu & Malayalam– and being a SPI brand multiplex, they have a No-dubbed policy, which is unbelievable for a theatre in this area. Getting weekend tickets to this theatre needs prior advance booking or sometimes pre-booking if it is a widely expected biggie. S2 Cinemas also has a spill-over crowd from other areas. Says Ramya from Vadapalani: “We generally try tickets in SPI properties. If tickets are full at Sathyam,Escape & Palazzo, we sometimes book at S2 if we want to watch a biggie during its 1st weekend at SPI cinemas”. While SPI Cinemas has done the unthinkable with their Perambur property, one must confess that the mushrooming of multiplexes is absent in this area.\n\nRight from shelving Indian anna and Indian paise to watch silent films at Padmanabha to paying one Indian rupee to watch black-and-white talkie films at Kinema Central to paying 120 rupees for a biggie at Idream to paying 150 rupees for a 3D flick at S2 Perambur, North Madras has seen it all! From hosting a single movie for 3 continuous Diwalis in 1944, North Chennai now offers the least shelf life for any biggie today! While Mount Road, Kodambakkam and Purasawalkam are more attractive areas with longer shelf life, the North Chennai theatres (barring S2 Perambur) offers the least shelf life for any super hit today! The lack of a high-end multiplex in the proper North Chennai heartland is a bane here. While there is a theory that North Chennai is populated by predominantly low-income groups and fishermen, many often forget that times have changed today and the IT working group too lives here in large numbers. Many of them generally go to Mount Road (which is hardly 8-9 km from one part of North Chennai) or Purasawalkam area (which is also not far) to catch a latest movie. The area can suddenly see a boom if the existing single-screens convert into a multiplex or if new multiplexes start coming! Today, the general rule is that any big film will get to release in 4 single-screens of proper North Madras (Idream,Bharath,Maharani & MM), multiple shows in the Perambur theaters (the 5-screen multiplex S2 Cinemas and Sribrinda) and the hits gets a re-run at Agastya. This makes North Chennai still viable and meaningful. But, what makes this area less lucrative today is that the movies reach saturation point very quickly in this region. Considering the dense population of North Chennai, increasing the quantity and quality of theaters in this area will go a long way in helping it to get back the lost aura! As you would know, more population rakes in more money, but presence of quality theaters is the driving force behind this!\n\n-AJAY SRINIVASAN\n\nMy Twitter feed is here:\n\nhttps://twitter.com/Ajaychairman\n\nCourtallam Travel Blog / Kutralam Travel Blog\n\nArticle by Ajay Srinivasan\n\nImagine being at the gorgeous Tulip Gardens in Kashmir or boating at the boisterous backwaters of Kerala or viewing the picturesque Kanchenjunga peak from Darjeeling. While these astonishing locales are sure to mesmerize you with their pristine beauty, human participation is limited considering the characteristics of these locales. You can fall in love with and at Tulip Gardens; but you cannot sit on the garden’s grass. You may spend the whole day at the Kerala backwaters; but you are not going to swim on it. Your eyes will be treated to the beauty of sunrise from the snow-clad Kanchenjunga peak; but you can hardly touch it from Darjeeling. What makes the waterfalls at Courtallam, placed on the Western Ghats in Tirunelveli district, much superior is the immersion of mankind into the nature. Niagara Waterfalls is considered as the most famous waterfall in this planet; but the maximum you get out of it is a beautiful photograph clicked from a distance and you can witness the waterfalls in awe. Be it the gigantic Jog falls in Karnataka or the delirious Dudhsagar Falls near Goa or the astonishing Athirapally waterfalls in Kerala, you are barred from bathing in these falls as these gargantuan waterfalls are considered perilous for swimming. Probably that is where Courtallam-known as “The Spa of South India”– has managed to capture the imagination of the entire waterfall loving community. At Courtallam, Mother nature perfectly showers water to thousands of visitors, who throng to the spot, every day. It is true that other waterfall options are available around the globe where you can bath; but majority of these waterfalls are slippery with rocks and green pastures that might injure your body, if you are a bit offhand. At Courtallam, you can simply close your eyes and take a long shower without worrying about anything. The monstrous falling of water on your head from top of the mountains is an implausible stress buster that cannot be articulated in words.\n\nCourtallam is inimitable for some special reasons too, that separates it from the rest. Can you imagine being at the waterfall at the stroke of midnight with a bunch of fervent folks around you? ,Goutham, a posh businessman from Chennai, riding on his luxurious car, asks me: “But, why should someone bath at midnight and even if one wants to, don’t we have shower in our bathrooms?” The charm of bathing at waterfalls can be experienced only from pure nature lovers, who knows the difference between sitting in an air-conditioned bedroom and being at the waterfalls in midnight. “A 24-hour waterfall is my dream and when I came to know about Courtallam, I couldn’t believe a 24-hour waterfall does exist in the state I live in” chips in Aayushmaan from Chennai, who is awe-struck with the concept. What is also important to note is that despite being open for 24 hours, the location is considered as safe as you see the police patrons providing security cover even at 2 AM (in the night) in the flood-lit waterfall. “Today, even in a metro city, women are apprehensive walking on the roads after 9 PM. At Courtallam, you can freely bath at the waterfall during midnight, which is far-fetched even for a brave woman living in Chennai” says Meera, an IT professional working in Chennai. One can relate the experiences narrated by Meera or Aayushmaan. For example, in the famous beaches (Marina or Besant Nagar) of Chennai, you see the policemen asking people to leave and asking vendors to shut shops after 11 P.M. In a tourist destination like Courtallam, you not only get treated to natural chilled water at midnight, you can also taste the hot and crispy bajjis during middle of the night! The gigantic lights, which are placed around the waterfalls, is similar to what you see in big cricket stadiums, offers glorious lighting.\n\nPlanning a Cortallam trip needs some articulate research though! It is important to perfectly time your visit, which not only requires a coherent research, but also a bit of luck! The season, which typically runs from June-September, coincides with the Kerala monsoon as the waterfall is reliant on the southwest monsoon that kick-starts from June in Kerala. Water presence also continues from October-January thanks to the north-east monsoon in Tamil Nadu. The period from February-May are dry and if you land up during this time, you will return disappointed, as you will get to see only the rocks. But, your research cannot end with merely knowing the famous months to visit; you also need to keep a close watch on several aspects during season time also. There is a thumb rule that if water crosses the famous arc in the Main Falls, then it is a sign of flooding that causes a temporary ban on bathing. For example; one day might be heavy flooded when bathing would be prohibited there. On another day, water presence would be a trifling, which might ruin your trip. It is important to be in constant touch with the locals, who can offer some local knowledge. There is also a Facebook page tracking the status daily, which can help you to have some advance knowledge. Since yours truly also keeps track of the regular water levels there, occasional help can come from me too. But, no matter how much ever you plan, if you are travelling from a distant city like Chennai, you need a good amount of luck. Conditions are known to change drastically in 15 hours if you are unlucky. For starters, the best guide is to go there just after the floods so that there is copious water and at the same time, there is no overflow!\n\nFor the travelers from Chennai, there is a popular train daily called “Podhigai express”, that halts at Sengottai and Tenkasi, the two nearest railheads for Courtallam. Silambu Express, which is a bi-weekly, is an alternate option. Tickets in both these trains are generally sold like hot cakes and given the uncertain water levels in Courtallam waterfalls, thatkal ticketing is the only smart option, which helps you to time your visit to perfection. For the residents in Trichy or Madurai, the trip is logistically easier as you can make it by just catching a bus through last minute booking. If you are from Tirunelveli or Kanniyakumari, then a short drive on your car will take you closer to the nature. It is also important to plan well and stay away from the hefty weekend crowd. If you visit in the weekends, then you will be put in long queues only to get a small dip in the water for few minutes. A smart planner, will therefore, plan his trip during the weekdays and will throng to the waterfall during midnight. “I make it a point to visit Courtallam every year; but I make sure that I visit only during weekdays. I also ensure to sleep during the day and bath at night so that I am away from the populous crowd”. says Aadarsh from Chennai, who doesn’t mind taking a couple of days off to skip the weekend rush. Since Tirunelveli district is close to Kerala border, people from Trivandram, Ernakulam,Thrissur ,Guruvayur and other Kerala districts flock to Courtallam.\n\nMain falls (Peraruvi) is the central attraction and all roads during the season lead to the majestic Main falls. It helps if you can plan your stay around Peraruvi as it will help you to walk in and out of the waterfall in midnight and reach the hotel through walk. A regular visitor to Courtallam, will also be able to tell you the difference between the velocity levels of water, at different places in the main falls. The water velocity depends on where you stand in the main falls. The water velocity is at its maximum when you stand in the center of the waterfall. Depending on your comfort levels and preferences, you can shift between the different little areas of the main falls. An avid nature lover can also differentiate between the look and feel of water, during different seasons of the year at Peraruvi. Water structures, varies from how it feels on your body during South-east monsoon and how it feels during north-east monsoon. It is also breathtaking to visit Courtallam, during saaral time, when the overcast clouds start to sprinkle water over the air. During saaral time, even a relaxed walk around the streets of Courtallam, will give you your mind and body the much-needed tranquility. Next time, when you walk around the nature’s nest, do not forget to munch some unique fruits, that are available here. Watching the clouds change its pattern, texture and colors is an unworldly experience, that is exclusive only for the Courtallam tourists. “Our family visits Courtallam atleast once in 2 years; we check the water levels and drive to the spot in our car. We find the car journey very convenient as we donot need to hunt for a place to safekeep belongings before dipping in the falls for a bath” says Deepa from Madurai, whose family has an excellent appetite for travel. When you visit during the peak season, the experience you get from each of the waterfalls will generally outdo the previous ones. The impact these waterfalls can do to your body and mind is unmatched.\n\nThere are several reasons, why you feel closest to nature at Courtallam. Apart from the main falls (known as Peraruvi) that is celebrated in this article so far, there are also multiple number of waterfalls located in this region, adding to the magnetic beauty of the place. Three nearby options- Five Falls,Old Falls and Tiger Falls– are easily accessible from the main falls and are also accessible 24/7. Five falls (Aintharuvi) offers pleasant variety as you get to see five different streams flowing from the same mountain with each of them offering different medicinal values. Comparisons of the Five Falls with that of the five heads of a hooded cobra are evident as the cascade spread in five sections resemble so. There are regular buses that ply from main falls to Five falls, and this is the second most popular waterfall here after main falls. The only drawback in Five falls is the disturbance from loud speakers that are placed here. Old Falls (Pazhaya Courtallam) is famous for the beautiful scenery, oil massages and the naturally growing herbs that are believed to pass through its streams. To put things in perspective, Pazhaya Courtallam is the most ideal place for a shower; the water flow is positioned in one of the most comfortable levels. Once you get there, you would want to stay there!\n\nThere are three smaller options- Tiger Falls, small falls and fruit garden falls-that are preferred by a small section of the society. Tiger Falls (Puliaruvi) is a very small waterfall that is suitable mainly for kids and aging adults as the flow of water is very light. There is also fruit garden falls (Pazhathotta Aruvi), which is also known as VIP Falls, where water cascade descends from the fruit orchards. Small falls (Chittaruvi), located just above the main falls, is convenient for people, who find the main falls ferocious and hard hitting on them. “We are blessed that we live in Tirunelveli; we set-off to Courtallam every year as soon as we know the water levels. It gives us a soothing experience on a breezy day in July” says Vaidyanathan, a retired professional settled in Tirunelveli\n\nTwo exhilarating and adventurous options- Honey falls and Shenbaga Devi falls-offers delight for those who want to trek. The water drops from a height of 180+ feet at Honey falls. During monsoon, one cannot get near to this waterfall while one must negate the powerful water-current to bath here during summer. The climb towards this waterfall gives mind-blowing view of the Courtallam valley, but to reach this spot, one must climb through rocks, boulders and slippery steps. En-route to Honey falls, there is also Shenbagadevi waterfalls, which is now restricted due to several reasons. Shenbagadevi waterfalls is renowned for its unpolluted and heavenly water and the conglomeration of waterfall with the underneath natural pool. “A decade ago, we used to go to Shenbaga Devi Falls. Shenbaga Devi waterfalls can be reached via trekking from the main falls. From the top of main falls, we used to trek for 2 km to reach this beautiful waterfall. It is a complete water body, bordered by rocks, where one can bath in the falls and swim in the river underneath. Water to the main waterfalls travels from here and water is ultra-fresh in this waterfall. These days, there are restrictions to go to Shenbaga Devi falls because many people have polluted it throwing glass bottles” says Muthukumar, from Puliangudi who works in Chennai city for a living. At Puliangudi, 30 km away from Courtallam, there is also a lesser known waterfall- called Mundhal falls, where you get quiet surroundings and plenty of greenery. If you want try something less popular, then there is Erumai Jadi falls, which is a quiet cascade that has no bus connectivity and hence less crowded. If you want to escape from the bustling crowd of Courtallam, then you may want to head to Ghee Falls (Gundaru Dam) in Sengottai. This place is accessible only through jeep or through trekking and this waterfalls gives you a breathtaking view around the stream!\n\nThere are three more scintillating options- Palaruvi, Kumbhavurutty falls and Manalar Falls– that are in the border of Tamilnadu-Kerala, but are within 30 kms from Courtallam. Palaruvi-which can be accessed only till 6 PM-is popular for the unadulterated water. Some of the tourists, who visit Courtallam, also visit this spot to experience the splendor of sweet and fresh water. Kumbhavurutty falls, also require you to trek through the hilly areas. Manalar Falls is a picturesque location surrounded by lush greenery. One should keep in mind that some of these falls are remote areas, where mobile connectivity is limited. Three other options-Agasthiyar falls, Manimutharu falls and Banatheertham falls-located in Papanasam, is also around 30 km away from Courtallam and water is present all through the year in these falls. To put it simply, it is “Water, water everywhere” in and around Courtallam!\n\nCourtallam, attracts, different kinds of travelers. Families wanting some time-off, friends in search of frolic fun, working professionals who want to come out of their daily routines, teenage students planning a tour, a small group interested in spending their holiday with nature, pilgrims (en-route to Sabarimala) who wants to take a holy dip and solo travelers, who simply want to immerse themselves into nature are some of the regular visitors. “While my friends go there as they love the gushing waterfalls, I join them only because of my penchant for the famous Courtallam border parotta” says Sathya, a foodie from Trichy. It is imperative to take a break from your routines, switch off your cellphones and simply immerse yourself with the nature, which it at its very best at Courtallam. If your dream is to live with nature, then you are at the right place.\n\nAll waterfalls in Courtallam, are believed to be offering herbal values. Old timers say it has the reputation of curing several diseases in the past. Though no scientific evidence is available to support, a single visit to Courtallam have been known to at least keep you free from routine troubles like common cold, etc. for 3-4 months. If nothing, bath at Courtallam’s natural waterways is the best way to beat your body heat and stress. What on"
