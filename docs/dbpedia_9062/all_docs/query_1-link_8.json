        "text": "Not Quite Bob – Americana Part 2 – The Long Ryders, Ray La Montagne, Kurt Vile, Jason Isbell\n\nThis week 4 very different takes on the broad church of Americana. As I suggested last week there’s a list on the interwebs of 150 artists, ranked if you don’t mind, that fit the bill. Despite my view that such rankings are spurious at best it is fair to say that these artists belong comfortably in the category and, unlike some of the others on that list, they do all have NQB credentials in song style and delivery. And in that they’re mostly younger than a lot of the old coots featured in this series they suggest where this music might be going.\n\nThe good news? They’re not even similar to one another so there’s plenty of scope for a fresh take.\n\nThe Long Ryders\n\nLA based when formed in 1982 from the remnants of other garage bands The Long Ryders roots could be found in Dylan, Buffalo Springfield and the Burritos. From their first album in 1984, Native Sons, here is ‘Tell It To The Judge On Sunday’.\n\n?\n\nThe next album the following year, State Of Our Union, is full of really good songs and is probably the pick of the only 4 albums they produced however its not available via the streamers except with Live versions and Demos. But that’s OK because YouTube has this version of the standout ‘Looking For Lewis & Clark’. The title alone had me reaching for the wallet at the time and it was another mix tape favorite when getting pissed with like mindeds was a regular event on a Saturday after the footy.\n\nAfter 3 albums they break up in 1987 but then appear live spasmodically at festivals and gigs thereafter until in 2019 they release Psychedlic Country Soul, another excellent album.\n\nRay LaMontagne\n\nBorn in New Hampshire in 1973 (a young ‘un) Ray bases himself in Maine and starts recording in 1999 with the release of Trouble. He was inspired to create music after hearing an album by Stephen Stills. Critics have compared LaMontagne’s music to that of Otis Redding, Ryan Adams, Beck, Pink Floyd, The Band, Van Morrison, Nick Drake and Tim Buckley. How about that for a varied bunch!\n\nHis first few albums are each a bit different one from the other but are basically in the folk rock idiom he seems so keen on. The title track from the first album then.\n\nInstantly obvious? The strings I guess. But more particularly, unlike many others in this space, he can really sing. Smooth as, the cry in the voice, the whole enchilada.\n\nI really like the first 3 albums but the 4th God Willing & The Creek Don’t Rise is where it all comes together.\n\n?\n\nThe title track is an achingly beautiful song. Here on Letterman.\n\n?\n\nHis next few releases show a bit more experimentation but all have their moments. Of interest is that Ouroboros in 2016 is where the Pink Floyd reference is made. I think that should be best left to Messrs. Waters and Gilmore but it’s an interesting record nonetheless.\n\nBy 2018 with Part of the Light he’s in more familiar territory and from that on Later With Jools here is ‘Such A Simple Thing’.\n\n?\n\nOne of the commenters on this clip wonders “How can someone’s voice be so powerful and soft at the same time?” That’s a pretty good summary.\n\nKurt Vile\n\nOn the other hand … another way to have a voice that makes you sit up is for it to be unique, yours and only yours, for a song to come on Tim or Brian’s shows and for you to say “Ahh, Kurt.” That’s Kurt Vile. An even younger young ‘un Kurt was born in 1980 in Philadelphia and started out with a band called The War On Drugs with whom he has a short stint before releasing his first solo album in 2003. He cites his influences as being Pavement, John Prine, Neil Young, Tom Petty, Dinosaur Jr, John Fahey and yes Bob. Natch. Sticking strictly (well mostly) to Hall of Famers.\n\nIn 2011 he breaks through with Smoke Ring For My Halo but it’s Wakin On A Pretty Daze in 2013 when he really arrives.\n\n?\n\nOn high rotation on RRR and PBS, never to be heard on the mainstream but the hip kids love him. The laconic delivery, the crafty songs and the ever present distinctive guitar stylings he is a one off even if you can hear him in the work of others.\n\nIn 2015 he releases b’lieve I’m goin down and from there his ‘hit’ ‘Pretty Pimpin’.\n\n?\n\nIn 2017 he and Courtney Barnett collaborate on Lotta Sea Lice and from there ‘Over Everything’.\n\n?\n\nI know this wry, slacker stuff isn’t for everyone but I find it hypnotic and beguiling. I’ve seen Kurt live and he is compelling in the right setting. He keeps pumping them out too with Bottle It In in 2018 and (watch my moves) just last week which I haven’t even listened to yet. Give it a go, you’ll get hooked.\n\nJason Isbell\n\nI know I’m on safe turf here though with other pieces on this site referencing Jason Isbell. With warm praise I should add. A year older than Kurt Vile, Jason is a boy from the South, Alabama, who had a stint in the Drive By Truckers before leaving in 2007 to go solo.\n\nIt’s 2013’s Southeastern (his 4th album) that first grabs my attention.\n\nI’m hooked but this track from the next album Something More Than Free in 2015 seals the deal. ‘Children of Children’ live.\n\n?<\n\nGreat singing, great songwriting and, touching another nerve, a really good guitarist too. Jason is prolific too, riding the wave, with something new every year including releases with a band he calls The 400 Unit (more players, less intimate songs). In 2017 The Nashville Sound.\n\n?\n\nSo to prove the NQB point on this one Jason also is a frequent coverer of Bob Dylan songs. Here live with Sheryl Crow on ‘Everything Is Broken’. You don’t have to be a trainspotter and there are no bonus points for noticing the setting.\n\n?\n\nTasty. The future of the genre is in good hands.\n\nYou can read more from Trevor Blainey HERE.\n\nRead more stories from Almanac Music HERE\n\nIf you would like to receive the Almanac Music and Poetry newsletter we will add you to the list.
