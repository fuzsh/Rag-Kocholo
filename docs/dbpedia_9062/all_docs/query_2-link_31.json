        "text": "The Long Ryders are an American alternative country and Paisley Underground band, principally active between 1982 and 1987, who have periodically regrouped for brief reunions (2004, 2009, 2014, 2016). In 2019 they released a new studio album – their first in 32 years – and announced a series of tour dates to follow.\n\nThe Long Ryders were originally formed by several American musicians who were each multi-instrumentalists and influenced by Gram Parsons, the Byrds, country music and various punk rock groups. They were named after the Walter Hill film, the Long Riders. The band featured Sid Griffin and Stephen McCarthy on vocals and guitar; Des Brewer on bass (later replaced by Tom Stevens); and Greg Sowders on drums.\n\n[]\n\nA long time favorite of the group, Kershaw even interviewed the band on the Old Grey Whistle Test as well as playing their single as his first record on his debut BBC Radio One show in 1985. He also got them to do a session for his show in 2004 after they decided to do a reunion.\n\nSessions[]\n\n1. Recorded: unknown.
