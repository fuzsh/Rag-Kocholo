        "text": "Latest News\n\nNative Sons October 2024 Tour\n\nThe Long Ryders will perform a handful of special shows to celebrate the 40th anniversary of their iconic album \"Native Sons\" across the UK and Europe this October.\n\nFor full details and Ticket links please visit the Tour Dates page.\n\nNative Sons 3CD Expanded Box Set\n\nReleased January 19th, the long-awaited expanded edition of The Long Ryders debut album Native Sons is Out Now. Compiled in conjunction with the band, this new 3CD edition contains the original album alongside a raft of demos, B-sides, and a scorching live recording from 1985.\n\nDescribed at the time by Melody Maker as a âmodern American classicâ this is the album which kick-started Americana and put the âaltâ into Alt-Country! Native Sons was a number one USA indie/alternative album and a number two in the UK (to Meat Is Murder) and you can pre-order this 3CD box set from Cherry Red Records at cherryred.co/NativeSons\n\nOrder Now\n\nA key foundation stone of Americana and alt-country movements of today this was a popular indie/college radio release in the USA and a huge indie album in Europe when originally released. Via a remastered album, a CD of demos and outtakes, and a CD from a blistering live show in London in â85 you can now hear why. And how! ð¸ ð¥ ð¶\n\nStephen McCarthy on SiriusXM\n\nAhead of this months release of the Native Sons Box Set Stephen spoke about life in The Log Ryders and beyond with Mitch Marine, Bill Bentley and Eugene Edwards on the âFrom Cowpunks To Now Punksâ show.\n\nTune in to Dwight Yoakam and The Bakersfield Beat (Dwight Yoakam's Music Channel) on SiriusXM - Channel 349. Hear the interview at noon (Pacific Time) and again at 9:00 PM on Saturday, January 6\n\nThe Long Ryders Live EP\n\nThe Long Ryders recorded two live shows in May and it was decided a new EP would be a fine way to promote both the last album, September November, andâ¦drum roll hereâ¦be an audible reminder to all about the upcoming October European tour (Tickets for all shows on sale now)\n\nï¸ð§ Listen via cherryred.co/TLRCopenhagen23\n\nThe three song EP has Stephen singing one old classic, Sid singing a tune from the recent September November album, and Murry Hammond singing a cover song from the tourâ¦a cover song which seemingly everyone knows!\n\nThe 10 Best Americana Albums Of All Time\n\nThe Long Ryders feature at no less than number five in uDiscoverMusic's 'The 10 Best Americana Albums Of All Time'\n\n\"5: The Long Ryders: State Of Our Union (1985)\n\nUnlike many of the best Americana albums on this list, this album wasnât a big hit, nor did the band ever have one. The Long Ryders were well aware that they were crying into the wilderness. The 80s just werenât a great time for a band that revered Gram Parsons and Buffalo Springfield, but thatâs precisely what gives State Of Our Union its urgency.\n\nThe other big element in their mix was full-throttle garage rock, and it all comes together on the 12-string-driven âCapturing The Flag.â Without exaggeration, itâs as great a song as Springfield and the Burritos ever wrote. Another high point of the album is the celebratory âLooking For Lewis And Clark,â which namechecks Parsons, Tim Hardin, and âLouie Louie.â In the last-laugh department, The Long Ryders have reunited and have a new album on the way.\"\n\nSid had this to say \"To see this in Apple News today, Sept 30, is pretty meaningful to me. When released the Long Rydersâ State Of Our Union LP it got mediocre reviews from the UK press but was a Number One college radio album in the USA and a particularly big seller in, yes sir, Spain.\"\n\n\"So to read Brett Milanoâs thoughtful reappraisal is quite a moment for me but no, I confess I do not think it is a better album than the Burritosâ Gilded Palace Of Sin. (One day I will call a solo album The Gilded Palace Of Sid.) Do please read Mr Milanoâs note and enjoy the entire article. BTW, there is now a three CD box set edition of this very album available via Cherry Red Records. Just sayinâ\"\n\nRead the full article here.\n\nFALL EUROPE & UK TOUR - October 2023\n\nThe October tour of Europe by the Long Ryders is a reality. Tickets on sale now.\n\nHere are the dates and if it is anything like the whirlwind of lovely madness which our spring tour was then it is going to be a heckuva ride.\n\nThe Long Ryders Sign New Administration Agreement With Limited Edition Music Publishing\n\nLos Angeles, CA - April 12, 2023 - The Long Ryders, the legendary American alternative country and rock band have signed a worldwide administration agreement with Limited Edition Music Publishing. The new deal covers the band's entire music catalog, including future releases.\n\nLimited Edition Music Publishing will handle all aspects of The Long Ryders' song catalog including licensing, synchronization and royalty collections. This ensures the band's music will continue to be marketed and promoted on a worldwide basis. The band is about to embark on a UK and European tour to promote their new album September November on Cherry Red Records. Their world tour continues through 2024.\n\nâI know all the Long Ryders are thrilled to have signed with Limited Edition Music Publishing,\" said Sid Griffin. \"Their extensive knowledge of our music and their expertise in this industry make them the perfect partner for us. I mean perfect, too. We cannot wait to start working with them and bringing our music to a new generation of fans.â\n\nStephen McCarthy added âMarc and Greg are the perfect publishers for the Long Ryders. Their passion and experience from the street level up are key. Plus, it doesnât hurt to have one of your publishers behind the songs and behind the drum kit every night!â\n\nLimited Edition Music Publishing is equally excited about the partnership. \"We are honored to be working with The Long Ryders, a uniquely original and important band that has been making music for over forty years. They played a pivotal role in shaping the alternative country and americana music genres,\" said Marc Wilson, Co-President of Limited Edition Music. \"We are committed to helping them reach new heights by making their music even more accessible to fans all over the world.\"\n\nThe Long Ryders formed in Los Angeles in 1982 and have released a number of critically acclaimed albums throughout their career, including \"Native Sons\", \"State of Our Union\" and their just released new album âSeptember November.â They are the recipients of the Americana UK Music Associationâs 2022 International Trailblazer award and are currently featured in the Country Music Hall of Fameâs âWestern Edgeâ exhibit. Their music has been described as a blend of americana, rock, punk and country, and continues to influence artists all over the world.\n\nSeptember November is Out Now!\n\nLadies and gentlemen, the four year wait is over!

September November will be released on March 10th on CD and 12â vinyl.\n\n12 originals produced by the legendary Ed Stasium, in Sidâs words the album is âtwo thirds the distilled alt- country genre we helped found back in the 1980s, one third Paisley Underground adventurism yet seasoned with a dash of our own crazed soulfulness thrown in.â\n\nTour News\n\nThe Long Ryders perform their first concerts since before the pandemic, and their first USA shows in four years, when they perform the SiriusXM Outlaw Country West cruise this November and follow it up with three shows for landlubbers in their old California home base.\n\nThe Long Ryders are pleased to announce their good friend Murry Hammond from the Old 97âs will be joining them on bass for these upcoming West Coast tour dates.These are the first concerts without the late Tom Stevens on bass so emotions will be sky highâ¦please come out to see the band carry on into a new day!\n\nFull details on the Tour Dates page.\n\nWestern Edge: The Roots and Reverberations of Los Angeles Country-Rock\n\nThe Long Ryders were pleased to be rightfully included in the Country Music Hall Of Fame in Nashville USA for their impressive Western Edge: The Roots and Reverberations of Los Angeles Country-Rock exhibit.\n\nThis exhibit will last three years, until May 2025, at the Country Music Hall Of Fame and to see the Long Ryders photo and various bits of memorabilia next to material from The Byrds, Emmylou Harris, Michael Nesmithâs First National Band, Lucinda Williams, Dwight Yoakam, Linda Ronstadt, Buffalo Springfield, Los Lobos and so many other famous names was a true thrill.\n\nPlease check out the exhibit if and when you can. Everyone is raving about it and you can learn so much!\n\nThe Country Music Hall Of Fame website has this to say about the exhibit: \"Western Edge: The Roots and Reverberations of Los Angeles Country-Rock traces communities of visionary singers, songwriters, and musicians who set about reinvigorating the sounds of pop and rock by infusing elements of country, bluegrass, and folk music. Fostered in local nightclubs and late-night jam sessions, the resulting musical fusion, âcountry-rock,â made a lasting impact on popular music.\n\nThe exhibit surveys the rise of the Byrds, Buffalo Springfield, the Flying Burrito Brothers, Poco, Eagles, Emmylou Harris, Nitty Gritty Dirt Band, Linda Ronstadt and many others who, in the 1960s and â70s, found commercial success with new sounds that merged rock & roll rhythms and attitude with country and bluegrass instrumentation and harmonies. As they flourished, so did the Los Angeles-based recording industry.\n\nThese trailblazersâ musical contributions were expanded upon by the next generation of Los Angeles roots music performersâthe Blasters, Rosie Flores, Los Lobos, Lone Justice, Dwight Yoakam, and moreâwho once again looked to traditional American music for inspiration. Blending hard-edged honky-tonk, Mexican folk music, rockabilly, and punk rock, these artistsâalong with their country-rock predecessorsâprovided inspiration to future generations of country and Americana artists.\"\n\nInternational Trailblazers - The Long Ryders\n\nThe Long Ryders were pleased and proud to receive the International Trailblazer Award, an award presented to an \"International artist, duo or group that has taken an exceptional path, inspiring others in the Americana genre\" from the Americana Music Association UK last month.\n\nWhile all the band were unable to be there in person due to the Covid related cancellation of the full awards show. Sid stepped up to accept the award in person from the great Nick Stewart and both Greg and Stephen beamed their thanks into the show... View the acceptance speech at this link.\n\nSid Griffin & Stephen McCarthy Show Announced\n\nð Sid and Stephen to play a very special, one night only, show in London! Tickets On Sale Now\n\nSid sez \"Friday June 17 The Long Ryders Stephen McCarthy and I play a very special and rare acoustic show in London. We had to cancel playing a Russian oligarchâs venue because of the tragedy of ðºð¦ and when Stephen decided to come over anyway I proposed this showâ¦and the gig is on, the game is afoot!\n\nOnly 60 capacity so hope you diehards can get in, we could not find a bigger venue on short notice but Rich and The Betsey Trotwood are THE BEST and we were lucky to score his upstairs room.

Carla produced the album which also features cuts by John Fogerty, Dave Alvin, Peter Case et.\"\n\nRead more from Stephen about the project on Pop Matters.\n\nFrom The Observer, March 6, 2022...\n\n\"The Long Ryders song Ivory Tower once sparked a brief, urinal-based encounter between me and the Russian oligarch\"\n\nTodayâs The Observer Sunday newspaper featured a fine Stewart Lee article about his witnessing The Long Ryders in concert while standing near Russian oligarch Roman Abramovich. We knew Stewart Lee was a Long Ryders fan but Roman Abramovich?\n\nIt can be read in full online via The Guardian website. The Guardian also has a good page on what can personally be done to help with the situation in the Ukraine here.\n\nThe Long Ryders return this summer to play two shows at Under the Bridge in London on June 17 and 18.\n\nTom-Tom\n\nA year ago our longtime bass player and dear friend Tom Stevens died. He was a terrific person, a devoted husband and father, and the best bass player of his generation in Los Angeles. Wanting to do a song in his honour but, aware of Covid, the Long Ryders were forced to email sound files back-and-forth till we had something we all liked.\n\nThis song went from Greg in Los Angelesâ¦the lyrics coming to him in a dreamâ¦to Stephen in Virginia, to Ed Stasium near San Diego and then to Sid in London, England.\n\nDespite us being in four different locations the Long Ryders feel they came up with something pretty special.\n\nThe Long Ryders to join the November 2022 Outlaw Country West Cruise\n\nAhoy you seafaring rockers! The Long Ryders are very pleased to announce they will set sail on the first-ever Outlaw Country West cruise.\n\nRide into the sunset for Outlaw Country West, a new festival cruising from Los Angeles to Cabo San Lucas and Ensenada, Mexico, November 3-8, 2022, with an epic lineup celebrating Californiaâs Country Rock and Cow Punk legacy.

Michele Stodart of the Magic Numbers will graciously sit in for our fallen comrade the late Tom Stevens on bass for this evening.\n\nThere will be a follow-up announcement soon about further 2022 Long Ryders activities so please check back here in about a week or sign up for The Long Ryders Newsletter.\n\nTo our American pals we say have a Happy Thanksgiving! To our European pals we say how happy we are to see them soon!\n\nAll the best, The Long Ryders\n\nTom\n\nToday, September 18, we celebrate our rocking brother Sidâs birthday and also remember our friend & band mate Tom Stevens with this sneak peak of the next Long Rydersâ song âTom Tomâ, produced by the great Ed Stasium. We hope you like it.\n\nStay tuned for more music soon. Peace, love, rock nâ roll. Stephen & Greg\n\nJuly 2021\n\nGood news friends and family!\n\nThe guys are getting together later this year to work on some new music. Rest assured Tom's spirit will be in the room too! Peace, love and rock & roll.ð¤ âï¸\n\n17 Ways (A tribute to Tom Stevens)\n\nHere is bandmate Sid Griffinâs tribute to Tom Stevens. âTis Sidâs version of Tomâs song 17 Ways which the Long Ryders demoed and was released by Tom on his solo albumâs reissue, Points Revisited (MAIA Records, 1997). The backing here is by Kevin Stokes. Thanks, Kev!\n\nWritten by Tom Stevens\n\nSong published by Textbook Paranoia Music (BMI)\n\nwww.tomstevens.org â thetomstevens.bandcamp.com/music\n\nMusicCares\n\nBy request of Tom's wife, Elaine Stevens, we are posting this link to donate to MusicCares in memory of Tom Stevens. This charity was a favorite of Tom's and to donate would be an excellent way to honor him.\n\nMusicCares helps musicians in times of need, and if you love music, you know that although the music business can be unstable at best, with the onset of Covid-19, musicians need help more than ever. We hope you will consider donating what you can, and be sure to mark it as being in Memory of Tom Stevens. Thank you! â¤\n\nTom Stevens\n\nTo all our friends, fans and familyâ¦ it is with heavy hearts that we share the sad news our brother Tom Stevens has left us quite suddenly. We ask you all to keep Tom, his loving wife Elaine, Sarah, Zach and James in your thoughts. Tom loved you all so much. Play his beautiful song âLet it Flyâ and be grateful for the time we all had together. We are.\n\nPeace, love and Tom Stevens to you all.\n\nSid, Stephen & Greg\n\nThe news as featured on Variety and Billboard and read a personal tribute written by Sid for Shindig Magazine.\n\nNew interview with Sid in Australia's Rhythms magazine\n\nSid spoke to Brian Wise at Rhythms Music Magazine in Australia about whats been going down for The Long Ryders and what may be coming up...\n\nCheck out this months Rhythms Music Magazine or click the image below to read the interview.\n\nDown To The Well - Out Now!\n\n\"Feeling the impending weight of an ill wind about to blow as the country grows more and more divided. So many have sold their soul and to what end? With a thirst for knowledge & a desire for reconciliation Iâm going Down to the well.\"\n\nStephen McCarthy\n\nAttention all rockers, quarantine kids and Long Ryder fans ... new single âDown To The Wellâ b/w new remix of âIf You Want To See Me Cryâ is out now!\n\nWe recorded most of âDown To The Wellâ long distance. The band emailed sound files back-and-forth till we had something we all liked. Some of the basic tracks were recorded live in Richmond, Virginia. The song was written in December 2016 and recorded mid-February 2017. Stephenâs lyrics really seem fit the times we are all trying to survive.\n\nSidâs beautiful ballad âIf You Want To See Me Cryâ is a remix from the Psychedelic Country Soul album. Our long-time producer Ed Stasium gave this one a different feel.\n\nSpin, Listen, Dig - Bandcamp, Spotify, Apple Music, Deezer and TIDAL.\n\nCover photography by Tom Gold.\n\nRockin' At The Roxy/State Of Our Reunion\n\nThe Long Ryders back in 1986 Rockin' At The Roxy Theatre - Taped for TV broadcast in Europe and now on our new Bandcamp along with the 2004 State Of Our Reunion DVD.\n\n(Check out A Stitch In Time from that show here.)\n\nThe Long Ryders on Bandcamp for #BandcampFriday\n\nThis just in from Sid - \"The Long Ryders are now on Bandcamp as of today, July 3! Yes, you can now download both Metallic B.O. and Three Minute Warnings: The Long Ryders Live In New York City for mere thruppence and still have money left over for a pint of Guinness.\"\n\nAs part of #BandcampFriday this July 3rd all artist fees are waived from midnight to midnight (PDT) as Bandcamp do their best to help artists with tours and shows cancelled.\n\nFurther Long Ryders releases will appear in the near future so do follow us on Bandcamp if you can.\n\nAll Aboard - Lockdown Video\n\nFriends, fans of popular music, and those reading this aloud to their captive household, the Long Ryders are proud to announce they have a new video for their song All Aboard. The tune was of course found on their number one album (official UK Americana chart, Amazon American/alt-country chart too) Psychedelic Country Soul, and emanates from a demo Tom Stevens sent to Sid a little over four years ago.\n\nAs each Long Ryder was in lockdown anyway there was no reason for concern about not getting together. With no budget and not much foresight the band decided to enter into the spirit of combating coronavirus by each band member recording themselves on a cell phone. Edited by ace filmmaker Chris Hathway the finished product is slated to do the rounds of film festivals worldwide when the lockdown endsâ¦and as Sid points out, the lockdown will end. So, with a musical version of the Dunkirk spirit, pressing us forward, here it is. All Aboard!\n\nIn the meantime we can also announce the long-awaited box set of Native Sons is in the works!\n\nCompiled by the bandâs erudite archivist, Tom Stevens, it will consist of three discs. The first will be a remastered version of the album with a few outtakes, the second will be further outtakes and a few demos from the early 1984 demo sessions at Vitus Matareâs studio, and the third disc is a red-hot live in concert performance from the bandâs autumn â84 tour to support their most successful album. Alas, this Native Sons box set will not appear on the market till late 2021 at the earliest as it takes quite some time to compile the photographs and sort out the legalities.\n\nBy the way, if anyone has photos of the Long Ryders from this era (1984) they would loan us for this Native Sons box set then please, please, pleaseâ¦as James Brown once sangâ¦get them to Sid G or Tom Stevens soon as you can! Many thanks indeed.\n\nThe Long Ryders send love & light to you all.\n\nStay safe, stay home, wash those hands! Remember... rock and roll kills germs on contact!"
