        "text": "Digitally remastered and expanded three CD edition. The Long Ryders were formed in 1982 by young American musicians influenced by Gram Parsons, C&W, The Byrds, and the punk scene found in their hometown of Los Angeles. The Long Ryders were an anecdote to formula stadium rock and wimpy synth-pop. The band featured Sid Griffin on guitar, autoharp, and harmonica, Stephen McCarthy on guitar, steel guitar, mandolin, and banjo, Tom Stevens, bass, and Greg Sowders, playing drums and percussion. With a sound reminiscent of the Buffalo Springfield and The Flying Burrito Brothers, but with a harder edge, they anticipated the alternative country music of the 1990s by a decade. This version overseen by Tom Stevens contains the remastered album, a set of demos from the band's archive, and a legendary show from London's Mean Fiddler. Remastered by Andy Pearce the recordings, in Sid's opinion, have never sounded so good. A new booklet designed by Phil Smee contains many rare photos and memorabilia from the band's own collections as well as liner notes by bassist Tom Stevens.\n\nDisc 1\n\n1 Looking for Lewis and Clark\n\n2 Lights of Downtown\n\n3 Wdia\n\n4 Mason-Dixon Line\n\n5 Here Comes That Train Again\n\n6 Years Long Ago\n\n7 Good Times Tomorrow, Hard Times Today\n\n8 Two Kinds of Love\n\n9 You Just Can't Ride the Boxcars Anymore\n\n10 Capturing the Flag\n\n11 State of My Union\n\n12 If I Were a Bramble and You Were a Rose (B-Side)\n\n13 Southside of the Story (B-Side)\n\n14 Child Bride (B-Side)\n\n15 Christmas in New Zealand\n\n16 (Spinning Wighats Session)\n\nDisc 2\n\n1 Good Times Tomorrow, Hard Times Today\n\n2 Mason Dixon Line\n\n3 South Side of the Story\n\n4 State of My Union\n\n5 Lights of Downtown\n\n6 Child Bride\n\n7 Looking for Lewis and Clark\n\n8 Two Kinds of Love\n\n9 Wdia\n\n10 Here Comes That Train Again\n\n11 You Just Can't Ride the Boxcars Anymore\n\n12 Years Long Ago (Demo / Tom Stevens)\n\nDisc 3\n\n1 Tell It to the Judge on Sunday\n\n2 Still Get By\n\n3 You Just Can't Ride the Boxcars Anymore\n\n4 Good Times Tomorrow\n\n5 Wreck of the 809\n\n6 Lights of Downtown\n\n7 Run Dusty Run\n\n8 Years Long Ago\n\n9 Capturing the Flag\n\n10 I Had a Dream\n\n11 Final Wild Son\n\n12 Baby We All Gotta Go Down\n\n13 State of My Union\n\n14 Sweet Mental Revenge\n\n15 Looking for Lewis & Clark\n\n16 Send Me a Postcard\n\n17 Highway 61 Revisited\n\n18 Encore from Hell\n\n19 10-5-60"
