        "text": "When I look at a map of North Carolina I ask myself how a Greek who was brought up on an island (Long Island) and has spent a quarter of his life on the Greek Islands can live in a town two long hours from the sea? The answer is music. For as long as I can remember music was always the most important part of my life. Not necessarily playing music, but liking music and getting my friends to like the music I liked, whether it was to share my enthusiasm or just a validation that I had good taste and was cool. Music was more important than school. It was more important than whatever job I had. It was more important than my family. It was apparently more important than the sea. And it was more important than girls. Well, maybe not girls. In a way, it was a vehicle for meeting girls from the leading question of \"What bands do you like?\" to being a performer and making eye-contact with beautiful strangers while avoiding it with my girlfriend.\n\nThe '80s in Chapel Hill and the Triangle was for me the Golden Age of North Carolina music and maybe one of the richest periods of anywhere in the USA. People who came later will argue and give as evidence a long list of bands that went on to varying levels of national acclaim or local failure and I will agree that in the '90s and after there were certainly a lot more bands and some of them were (and still are) pretty good. But rarely did the bands which followed combine the full package of songwriting, singing and musical ability that if not common in the '80s was at least evident in the most popular of the bands of this period. I have included songs from anyone whose music I still have and didn't think they would get pissed off that I used it. You can click on the links and they should play in the background if I have done this right.\n\nPeople will tell you that in the '70s there was The Road Band or Southwing or a number of other groups that had their heydays playing the bars and frats at UNC, but no group before or since has been to North Carolina music what Arrogance was. While the southern norm was covering the Allmann Bros, Marshall Tucker, and Lynyrd Skynyrd, Arrogance was playing a type of music that might be called British roots with a strong West Coast influence. Imagine the Beatles, Free, the Move, the Byrds, Buffalo Springfield, and The Band thrown into a pot and add a dash of folk, blues, and some loud guitar and you at least have the ingredients for a band like Arrogance. But what made the band great was not their influences but the ability of Robert Kirkland and Don Dixon, who were not only talented and prolific songwriters but extraordinary singers. The bass-playing Dixon had a voice that sounded like a cross between Paul Rogers, Ray Charles, and Joe Cocker and he used it with passion. Robert Kirkland could go from a low snarl to a beer-shattering scream. When these two voices were combined the results were harmonies that those in other bands could only dream about. Arrogance was also Marty Stout on keyboards, Scott Davidson on drums, and during their most popular period, guitarist Rod Abernethy who played a flamboyant George Harrison to Dixon and Kirkland's Lennon and McCartney. Arrogance would play weekends, sometime three nights at the Cat's Cradle doing a solid three hours of original music, ending the evening with an hour of cover songs like Born to Be Wild, Walk Don't Run, and my favorite the Easybeats' Friday on My Mind. But the covers were just icing on the cake. The originals were better and we Arrogance fans who numbered in the thousands danced all night singing the words to our favorite songs like Your Sister Told Me, Secrets, Cost of Money, Where Are You?, Southside Girl, Where Does The Time Go?, Burnin' Desire, and Open Window, which was as much the state anthem as James Taylor's Carolina on My Mind. Arrogance recorded several albums, none of which captured the magic of the band's live sound though all of them good albums. Signed to Warner Brothers, the record company did not know what to do with them, assigned a producer whose claim to fame was \"Snoopy Versus the Red Baron\" and forgot about them. In the end, the usual frustrations, solo aspirations, and road-weariness took their toll and the band split up. Dixon went solo, produced REM and a couple of hundred other groups, and eventually settled in as the husband and wife team of Don Dixon and Marti Jones. Rod Abernethy became Rod Dash and made it all the way to Star Search before losing in the first round. Robert Kirkland formed Kick The Future, possibly the most hard-edged, intelligent rock and roll band since the MC5, and recorded one album which included this great song: Give it All Up. Dixon recorded and produced many albums and had a couple of great singles, Praying Mantis and Most of the Girls Like to Dance, both from the album of the same name. Arrogance has done several reunion shows, the best at the NC Museum of Art in 2000.\n\nIn Greek, we have a word, Parea. It means the group of people you hang out with, the circle you move with. I like to extend its meaning to actually being what Kurt Vonnegut called a Karass, which is a Parea that goes beyond the boundaries of birth and death. A karass is the group of beings you come in contact with life afterlife. The Parea that came down to Chapel Hill from Winston-Salem included Chris Stamey, Mitch Easter, Chris Chamis, Robert Keely, Peter Holsapple, Will Rigby, and Bob Northcott and this group who in their last incarnation may have come from the UK because they brought to the NC music scene the '60s British Invasion with a touch of Sex Pistols punk as well as a style that makes a kindred spirit think \"I wish I had done that.\" The groups which were formed by various members of this Karass include the H-Bombs, (who with Th' Cigarettes from Raleigh) were NC's first punk band, Sneakers, who were the first new-wave band to actually do a record, and a good one at that, recorded in the Cat's Cradle, Secret Service, possibly the best power-pop band in the triangle during their first incarnation, Mitch Easter's Let's Active and of course The DB's who merely influenced every pop band in America because they were the favorite band of half the groups who came later. Stamey is back in Chapel Hill producing his own music and the music of others as is Peter Holsapple. Mitch is in Winston with his studio. Chamis plays Ringo for the Beatles cover band the BackBeat in Chapel Hill. The others are scattered around America hopefully to be reunited in this life or the next.\n\nLife can be divided into two paths. One is the path of light, the other of darkness. One is the path of reflection and the other the path of the chasing of bodily desires. To put it more simply, life can be divided into two groups of people: Those who like the Beatles and those who like the Stones. Beatle fans smoked hashish in high school and think Revolver, Rubber Soul, and Sergeant Pepper's are the high water-mark of music culture. Stones fans drink beer, would have sex with Mick (even if they are not gay), think Keith is a great guitarist and looks cool with a cigarette dangling out of his mouth, and leap to the dance floor at the first notes of Brown Sugar. In bands, you have the Beatles model which has at least two guys singing and everyone playing an instrument. The Stones model you have a lead singer who is the focus of attention (usually a jerk but not always) and everyone else just has to look cool and play reasonably well. Not surprisingly, musicians who follow the Stones model get lots of chicks. Beautiful ones too. The guys who follow the Beatles model get interesting conversations and sexual frustration, which luckily makes good song material. But we all know that in the end the Beatles people will go to heaven and the Stones people will be sent to a place where the only music is Aerosmith. In the early '80s, The Fabulous Knobs were the Rolling Stones and The Dads were the Beatles. The Fabulous Knobs were actually better than the Stones. This may raise some eyebrows. How can a band that had maybe one album, playing in bars in North Carolina be better than the Stones?\n\nFirst of all, you have to take into consideration that the Stones themselves though musically competent, in their live performances rarely rise above the level of a good high-school rock band playing Stones covers. So musicianship alone puts the Knobs over the Stones hump which in baseball would be the equivalent of the Mendoza line. Where the Knobs left Mick and company in the dust was in the category of lead singer. Debra Demilo was like Mick with the voice of Aretha Franklin. So what happened to the Fabulous Knobs? Debra got married and moved to Indiana. Terry Anderson, David Enloe and Jack Cornell formed The Woods who became an area favorite and were immortalized when the Georgia Satellites were signed on the strength of Terry's song Battleship Chains which somehow found its way onto that band's demo. Terry still shows up with a band at the occasional Sparkle Fest where he thunders through his style of redneck pop with balls and humor.\n\nThe Dads were the result of the musical and spiritual friendship of Rick Miller, now known as Parthenon Huxley and Matt Barrett (me). We played in bands in Greece, including the legendary CC Blues King, and then continued playing together in Chapel Hill. When brought to the attention of Don Dixon, who was intrigued by our taste and the fact that we had been playing together since junior high, he recorded us and got us a record deal with Moonlight Records, a local label owned by David Robert, who was at the time owner of the Cat's Cradle. The result was the Matt Barrett EP called The Ruse with the song Six-Pack which became an instant classic on the new UNC radio station WXYC. It was not until drummer and world-famous neurologist Dr. Scott Scwartzwelder joined and journeyman guitarist Zoe Lagergren was brought in to play bass that the Athens, Greece duo became the Dads, and for two years, beginning on Halloween of 1980, they were one of the most popular and danceable bands in the Triangle, playing a style of high-energy Beatles, Move and Who influenced originals and playing them fast. Original songs like The Machine, Jaded, and Saving up for L-57 were both danceable and musically interesting. The song Actress, written by friend and former-Dot Jimmy Agnello was probably their only slow song, but it was a crowd favorite.\n\nIn the end, it was like marrying the high school sweetheart that you have dated for ten years and gotten divorced a year after the wedding. Matt (still me) became a solo performer in Greece and at the Cave in Chapel Hill where he played so often that even people who had never heard him thought they had. He (I obviously) recorded a 45 at Overdub Lane with Wes Lachot called Is This It? b/w Nothing At All To Write Home About and later a highly acclaimed cassette album called The Price of Illusion, with Paul Price on a four-track in a shed in his mom's back yard. Another single Summertime, with boy wonder Andy Church never saw the light of day. His last recording before quitting the music biz was Helena Merikana with an all Hellenic band of Parthenon Huxley, Leigh Sioris, Ted Zarras and produced by fellow Greek Chris Chamis. Assembled is a better word than produced. The whole thing was done through the U.S. Mail. The song Old Friend was about Dot's lead singer Jimi Quidd who died in 1989.\n\nThere were other bands too that deserve praise. The X-teens were a sort of fusion of Talking Heads and Elvis Costello, and the most \"new wave\" of the triangle bands. They were great live and recorded a record or two on Moonlight. The Gillettes were led by guitar hero Terry McInturff who was like a Peter Townshend with the grace of a gazelle and like Pete ended his shows by smashing his guitar and unlike Pete taking it home and fixing it himself. (Terry became a highly acclaimed guitar maker in Pittsboro with his own line of guitars and an impressive list of customers.) The best of the rest were probably The Pressure Boys who came out of Chapel Hill High with a huge fan base that filled the local clubs as soon as they came of drinking age or even before. The Pressure Boys played a type of high-energy ska with horns. They were fronted and managed by lead-singer and trombonist John Plymale and featured perhaps the best drummer in town, Rob Ladd. They were the most likely band to score big just as national attention was focusing on the Triangle area. The Pressure Boys actually won the Snicker's Band Search contest (or maybe it was the Miller Beer contest.) Whatever contest it was the band refused to play a guitar in the shape of a giant Snickers bar or Miller bottle and they were cut loose by their sponsor.\n\nHegeV was George Hamilton V, son of Grande Ole Opry star George Hamilton IV. HegeV began playing in the ZoomZoom restaurant on acoustic guitar with a cello player, formed his band HegeV and the Heartattackers, then another called Gumbo Yaya (strangely his most popular band) which was a soul review with himself backed by a band and three female singers. In the end, before leaving town he put out an album of great songs called House of Tears which was the name of the big old house he and his band lived and rehearsed at on Airport Road. They had an old black hearse instead of a van. One thing about George that made him stand out was how comfortable he seemed on stage which is understandable since unlike the rest of us he grew up on stage. Chris Chamis told me how one night he watched George break a string early in the set, a catastrophe to most of us without a spare guitar. George calmly replaced the string while telling a story so smoothly it was like part of the act. George moved back to Nashville where he was originally from and became a regular on Grande Ole Opry like his Dad. He still turns up occasionally, usually with a killer band. Now he is living in Paris where of course they love him as much or more than Jerry Lewis and Mink Deville.\n\nThe Snap was led by probably the best guitar-player on the scene, Charlie Ward, who was something of a local legend before new wave and continued to be one after the group broke up when he was instrumental in reviving the blues in the area with the Triangle Blues Society. I don't know if there is any existing recording of the Snap but I have this version of a song I recorded called One More Time which includes some great guitar playing by Charlie Ward, done in one take by the way after never hearing the song before. The bouzouki and violin are played by Barney Pilgrim and the tuba or bell-horn euphonium by John Plymale. The drummer is Rob Ladd.\n\nJazz guitarist Scott Sawyer who has become a major player and tours worldwide could be seen every Wednesday at the Pyewacket restaurant with a series of area musicians and he also started the Monday night blues jams there too. Charles Petty of Shady Grove invited all sorts of folk, country and generally acoustic performers for Thursday nights so except for Tuesday you had enough music to get you to the weekend\n\nWhen Crash Landon and the Kamakazis opened for the Dads at the Cat's Cradle most of them were still in high school. It was their first club gig and most of them went on to have musical careers. It included Dexter and Sarah Romwebber who along with brother Joe, who was the singer for UV Prom, became local heroes if not celebrities. Flat Duo Jets began with Dexter Romwebber, just a kid then, singing frantic rock-a-billy and old rock and roll with bass player Tone Meyer and drummer Chris \"Crow\" Smith. Tone left the band and though he was an excellent bass-player, in a way it was addition by subtraction because it enabled Dexter to do what he does best which is to play unfettered. Dex is still around and like fine wine has gotten better with age. His sister Sarah played drums with The Psuedes, then Mondo Combo, Let's Active and Snatches of Pink, and later could be found working with Bryan Gibson in his guitar shop. Tone went on to play with the Chickenwire Gang.\n\nTaz Halloween has the voice of a great jazz and blues singer trapped in the body of a talented singer-songwriter. Taz could have easily gone on to fame and fortune singing the old standards she does so well but chose instead to remain true to her own music and art which was good but very personal and not everybody's cup of tea. She began as Wendy Shadburn in a version of The Holla Band that also featured guitarist Terry McInturff from the Gillettes, built up a following for her Taz Halloween multi-media shows, spent time as a torch singer with pianist Robert Griffin, moved to LA, came back, and started waiting tables at Michael's Pub while still playing occasionally.\n\nRed Herring came from Durham and along with the Boney Maroney Band were the vehicles for Billy Stevens, a multi-instrumentalist from Chicago, who owned the Sallam Cultural Center which was home to Brother Yuseff and his circle of friends, perhaps the best jazz musicians in the state. Boney Maroney was a straight cover band that focused on San Francisco and LA in the '60s and was later adopted by Duke Deadheads as the closest thing to the Dead available. Red Herring was a three-man band that combined beautiful harmonies, lots of instruments, and tons of humor. Imagine Firesign Theater with instruments or The Kingston Trio on acid.\n\nChapel Hill attracted bands from other towns and cities who made their mark on the scene. Cruise-a-matics played hours of flawless oldies and had a tall bass-player who looked like Opie Taylor from Andy of Mayberry. Nashville legends like David Olney and Tim Kreckle and guitar hero Glen Phillips were regulars at the Cradle as were NRBQ. From New York City, The Dots (photo), who were high school pals of mine, came down several times beginning in 1979 with a show at the Cats Cradle and again in 1980 to play a week's worth of gigs at the Pier, Friday's in Greensboro, the Cradle and, believe it or not, Crooks Corner which for a couple of years had live music in a room that was so loud bands had to put their amps on 1 and face them to the wall just so people could stand to be in the room. The Dots 1979 Sunday night gig at the Cradle initiated what became punk-new wave night and opened the doors to local and visiting groups every Sunday. Their gig at the Pier in 1982 with The Bangles featured a battle of the bands with the two groups insulting each other from the stage. Check out their songs Put on the Brakes, Let Me Take You to Lunch, and In Another World from their long out of print Return of the Dots LP."
