        "text": "Teddy and the Rough Riders are back! The brainchild of singing-songwriting duo Jack Quiggins and Ryan Jennings, the country rock outfit has returned with a new album and a taste of what fans can expect from the upcoming release.\n\nDown Home arrives Oct. 11, marking the follow-up to the group's 2022 Margo Price-produced self-titled LP. On the 11-track record, the band will be doubling down on their trademark Americana, gifting fans even more of what has made them such a well-loved act over the last several years.\n\nAhead of the release of Down Home, the band has shared the album's lead single, 'Catfish Summer', a sunny and jangling ode to the good ol' days.\n\nâThis one is about visiting my momâs side of the family who lived in Rockmart, Georgia,â Jennings shared of the ditty in a statement. âBut instead, my mom dropped me and my cousin off at my uncle Bubbaâs house for a few weeks.â\n\nApparently, Uncle Bubbaâs âhillbilly shackâ was a place of wonder, flanked by a catfish pond for fishing and the perfect location for a summer full of four-wheeler-riding, swimming, and bluegrass-picking to ensue.\n\nThe album's October release will find the group finishing off their lengthy tour across Europe, the United Kingdom and the United States, closing the months-long trek with a smattering of dates throughout Texas, Alabama, Tennessee and Georgia.\n\n--\n\nDown Home Tracklist:\n\n1. 'Bullet'\n\n2. 'Fast Livinâ'\n\n3. 'Catfish Summer'\n\n4. 'Trouble Sleeping'\n\n5. 'Golden Light'\n\n6. 'Ednaâs Song'\n\n7. 'Mountain Girl'\n\n8. 'Hippies'\n\n9. 'Love After Life'\n\n10. 'Bird Has Flown'\n\n11. 'Gettinâ High'\n\n--"
