        "text": "Great albums transcend their times. Such is the case with this gem from 1985, which sounds as fresh to my ears now as it did then.\n\nIn fact, if push came to shove and I really had to whittle down my voluminous Top 10 (lotsa ties!) to, say, a mere 25 titles (not as many ties!), this – the third release from Messrs. Griffin, McCarthy, Sowders & Stevens – would likely be among them. Since I bought State of Our Union at the newly minted (and now defunct) City Lights Records in State College, Pa., that fall, I don’t think I’ve gone longer than a few months without listening to it or – thanks to the 2-CD Anthology (1998) and Final Wild Songs box set (2016) – songs from it.\n\nIn many ways, the 11-song set – along with the Ryders’ 1983 E.P. 10-5-60 and 1984 LP Native Sons – served as a primer for what’s now called “Americana” music. It integrates rock ’n’ roll, R&B, country and folk into a tasty whole, contains glorious guitar work and incisive lyrics, and features melodies that burrow into the brain like a groundhog beneath a back deck. As with those earlier efforts, the Long Ryders build upon the traditions begun by such forebears as Bob Dylan, the Byrds, Buffalo Springfield and Flying Burrito Brothers while incorporating a punk and post-punk ethos. They embraced the past while remaining relevant to the present, in other words, such as on the Tom Stevens-penned “Years Long Ago,” about how the nostalgic pull of the past often hides ugly truths:\n\n“If we return to the places we lived in before\n\nWe turn from all that we’ve gained\n\nIf we lived out a life that we struggled to change\n\nJust to turn back the calendar page\n\nThen we’d see that our memory betrayed us\n\nWe’d see what had frightened us so\n\nWe’d hear all the voices that fall silent now\n\nPieces of years long ago.”\n\nAnother highlight: the anthemic “Looking for Lewis & Clark.\n\nAnother: “WDIA,” which offers a history lesson on the importance of America’s first black-run radio station to generations of black and white youth.\n\nAnd another: “State of My Union.” Robert Christgau, the dean of American rock critics, said that the song “aggravates the honest chauvinism of Ronnie Van Zant’s reflections on the same subject with the gratuitous self-righteousness of Neil Young.” That’s a criticism, I think, but I find it funny. It’s a great song. Here’s a live version (and, yes, I’ve shared it before):\n\nThe CD tacks on a couple cool bonus tracks originally released in the U.K. on the “Looking for Lewis and Clark” EP, which I picked up at City Lights sometime in early ’86.\n\nThe track listing:"
