        "text": "The transaction fee covers the costs of processing your order, packing and delivering the tickets to you. In many cases it also covers the cost of producing your tickets. This fee can also apply to tickets arranged for collection.\n\nThe transaction fee applies per order not per ticket. If you purchase six tickets, you only pay one transaction fee.\n\nThe transaction fee will vary depending on what type of postage we are being asked to use by the event organiser and these costs are reflective of the amount that See are charged by despatch companies. First class post and Registered Post prices will vary accordingly.\n\nSee only send tickets securely for events that do not issue duplicate tickets in the event that tickets get lost in the post.\n\nThis fee may also be applied to both print at home and e-tickets to cover the cost of deploying technology and/or staff to the venue site."
