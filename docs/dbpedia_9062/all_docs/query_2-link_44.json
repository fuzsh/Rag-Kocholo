        "text": "Folks, we’re delighted to announce a brand new album, our first in four years. September November will be released on March 10th on CD and 12” vinyl.\n\n12 originals produced by the legendary Ed Stasium, in Sid’s words the album is “two thirds the distilled alt- country genre we helped found back in the 1980s, one third Paisley Underground adventurism yet seasoned with a dash of our own crazed soulfulness thrown in.”\n\nPre-order the album at: https://www.cherryred.co.uk/artist/long-ryders-the/\n\nThe album’s songs are all originals by guitarist/ mandolinist Sid Griffin (author of the Bob Dylan ‘Basement Tapes’ book Million Dollar Bash) and guitarist/pedal steel player Stephen McCarthy (who also plays with the Jayhawks and the Dream Syndicate) with help from longtime drummer Greg Sowders.\n\nProduced by Ed Stasium, best known for his long relationship as producer and engineer for the Ramones. Ed has also produced two previous Long Ryders’ records and worked with Smithereens, Soul Asylum, Motörhead, Marshall Crenshaw, Living Colour, the Hoodoo Gurus and Julian Cope.\n\nDue to the unexpected passing of bassist Tom Stevens, bass duties on the new album were shared by Murry Hammond of Americana stalwarts the Old 97s and the Long Ryders’ own Stephen McCarthy. Guests appearing in the album include D. J. Bonebrake of Los Angeles’s punk legends X and Royal Academy of Music violinist Kerenza Peacock of the Coal Porters (now a popular L.A. session player for Disney and the Los Angeles Philharmonic).\n\nTrack Listing:"
