        "text": "2024 Music in the Meadow schedule\n\nSaturday May 25th kicks off this years Music in the Meadow season.\n\nJoin us for brews, unique NA beverages, dinner and all around great vibes.\n\nMusic from 6pm - 8ish pm on Saturday nights\n\nMay 25 | Dust in my Coffee\n\nDust in My Coffee originated in 2014 and is the creation of singer/songwriter/guitarist Brett Bush. Brett, an actual working cowboy, a fly-fishing tour guide and retired rodeo bull rider, likes to refer to his music as “cowboy music”. The addition of his long-time band mate and exquisite fiddler, Ethan Saw, Dust has evolved into an up-beat, high energy and dance inducing duo that adds a definitive “Celtic” flavor to Brett’s western folk sound and persona. Early on, Brett performed in punk and metal bands while Ethan studied classical violin. The duo perform Brett’s original songs whose themes incorporate the realities and folklore of cowboy life, visions of the American West and songs about and related to the mountains and environment of the Sierra Nevada’s and rural Northern California. Expect the boys to put on a joyfully raucous and rowdy performance and experience their truly unique and distinctive fusion of “Celtic flavored cowboy music”.\n\nJune 01 | Michael Rock & Echo Canyon\n\nHippie country, cosmic americana, and folk rock music. Inspired by artists including Neil Young, Gram Parsons, The Byrds, & Waylon Jennings, the upbeat sound of Echo Canyon features the iconic pedal steel guitar and will leave you tapping your toe or looking for the nearest dance partner.\n\n​\n\nJune 08 | Beautiful Dudes + Magic Carpet Ryders\n\nThe Dudes are Tom Bevitori, Robbie Landsburg, Art Echternacht and Zach Peach--all born and raised champions of Nevada City, California. Along with just wanting to have a good time, the Dudes bring personal and culturally relevant themes to life with rocking riffs and an uplifting optimism that is the perfect soundtrack and answer to our current times. Unity, triumph and of course the need to celebrate resound in their music and take us from epic minimalism to dreamy psychedelic heights full of feedback and swagger.\n\nMagic Carpet Ryders ride a droning zephyr of retro rock. Hailing from the musical Mecca of Nevada City, they play folk rock that is neither folk nor rock. Instead, they trawl the hinterlands of indie music, blending college rock, jangle pop, retro psychedelia and futuristic space sounds. The resulting music sounds like Archie’s playing ‘Sugar Sugar’ at the wrong speed. As children of the tightly knit NC music scene, the Ryders have all played together in different bands before. Singer/guitarist Chris Streng had previously climbed Mount Whateverest. Drummer Chad LaBerge and bassist Harry \"Hazz\" Collins had played with Streng in the notoriously chaotic grunge band Chat Room until everyone decided to mellow out.\n\nMagic Carpet Ryders strive to capture the halcyon days of initialed bands like REM and XTC without the pretension of U2 or INXS. Maybe it's retro, maybe it's right on time. They're not out to reinvent the wheel, they just want it to roll a little faster.\n\nJune 15 | Horsemouth\n\nA rock-reggae group out of North Tahoe, Horsemouth blends island sound with an aggressive edge. Their electric guitar and drums create a party-friendly vibe.\n\nJune 22 | Cory Branan\n\nCory Branan has proven himself as a top-notch songwriter, and a hyperdynamic performer with the ability to fingerpick finer than ‘60s Greenwich Village folkies and brutally strum like a proto punk shredder.​\n\nJune 29 | The Tens\n\nThe Tens began as a busking band and spent its formative years refining their raw, funky, soul sound on the corners of L.A.’s most iconic intersections. \"It is an annual honor to host The Tens, says Susan from the brewing lair, these guys are family!\"\n\nJuly 06 | The Johnson Party\n\nTHE JOHNSON PARTY is a musical collective based out of the mountain ski town of Truckee, California. We are ambassadors of the California Mountain Music sound, a style that fuses elements of reggae, rock, Americana and soul and advocates for a vibrant outdoor lifestyle culture and a deep respect for mother nature. The band members are all multi-instrumentalists and play a variety of electric and folk/acoustic instruments. When not playing music you can find the Johnson Party skiing mountain slopes or hiking in river canyons or involved in regional environmental projects.\n\nJuly 13 | Cavour\n\nCavour is a real live human person.\n\nCavour is also a band from Reno, NV. who released their debut IP in January 2024. At the first handful of live shows people said, “it reminds me of country music, except I like it.” Cavour likes country music, but does not really make country music. This audience perception may stem from the fact that live sets have included trippy cover versions of Roger Mill or Doug Sahm tunes, but Cavour’s music steal from many genres. The band’s sound includes stand-up bass, guitars, dobro and harmonica.\n\nJuly 20 | Danny Horton\n\nDanny is a local singer and songwriter who has been playing music professionally for over 20 years. Danny began his solo career in 2015 and plays outlaw country and folk rock.\n\nJuly 27 | Nightbrain\n\nFrom Nightbrain flows a blend of moody groove, clubby funk, and soulful chill-hop. Hailing from the Northern Sierra Nevadas, blending styles and collaboration since 2020. Formed in a small cabin in the woods, Nightbrain evolved from a passing passion to passionate pursuit. They dream to weave styles and ideas in new and exciting ways through music, and hope to share with all who will enjoy!\n\nKeys: Alex Lemnah Drums: Emmanuel Lemnah Vocals: Suzanne de Martimprey\n\nRythym & Trombone- Chase Ramirez Guitar: Nathan Retallack Bass: Chris Retallack\n\nAugust 03 | Nathan Ignacio\n\nNathan Ignacio is a one-man band who finds inspiration in the old sounds of blues, folk and Americana. He plays his own songs and favorite covers. In the words of Rich from the brewing lair \"Nathan is an amazing musician, I'm mesmerized every time I see him play.\"\n\n​\n\nAugust 10 | Big Mable & the Portholes\n\nSpecializing in face melting songs of the sea, Big Mable is a bit like the Beatles meeting the Temptations while fighting Blackbeard. Get ready to soak in the atmosphere as the band takes its audience on a nautical voyage through a musical fun bath of sea shanties, pub tunes and sing alongs.\n\nAugust 17 | Solorio\n\nSoloRio is a dirt poor English translation of two resonating truths – we are all floating down ‘one river’; and while doing so, need to remember to ‘just laugh’.\n\nSoloRio is a fresh Americana'n rock stone soup collaboration band based in the North Bay Area, California. The core ‘Solo’ band consists of C. Cameron Anderson, Andy Tester, Andy 'Dru' Rodgers, and Jay Young. Young drums and Tester bass conspire in dynamic heartbeat grooves and soundscapes while bringing voices to the four-part harmonies this band is known for.\n\nAugust 31 | Metal Echo, Carson City\n\nMetal Echo is a female-fronted rock cover band. They'll perform their favorite songs from the past four decades from artists like Metallica, Soundgarden, Led Zeppelin, Iron Maiden, Dio, Guns N' Roses, Alice in Chains, Jane’s Addiction, Stone Temple Pilots, Black Sabbath, Smashing Pumpkins, Deftones, Tool, Judas Priest and more! Metal Echo has performed with the founders of Seattle grunge—Mud Honey. ​\n\nOctober 5 | Loud at the Lair\n\nJoin us for our annual mini Punk Rock Fest with a lineup of 5 kickass bands TBA\n\nfollow us on Facebook or Instagram to get music updates.
