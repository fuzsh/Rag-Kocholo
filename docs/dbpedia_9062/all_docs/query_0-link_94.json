        "text": "Back in the day I dismissed these as “nothing new here to see” on the odd track or two I heard at the time.\n\nI went to see them live around 2016 i think and it was a really great gig. Sid announced that unfortunately they were out of their box set to sell and I had to make do with an earlier hits album from him at the merch stand. The sound (mastering) of this was really not to my taste.\n\nWell the Cherry Red box set came back into stock and what a wonderful album it is with sound quality that does justice to their catalog.\n\nFrom the blurb -4CD career overview of The Long Ryders compiled with both Sid Griffin and Tom Stevens from original tapes (where they exist) – Sid has contributed a track by track breakdown for the set.\n\nFeaturing all the original albums as well as demos, singles and rare live recordings.\n\nRemastered by Andy Pearce the recordings and in Sid’s opinion have never sounded so good.\n\nWith a booklet designed by Phil Smee containing many rare photos and memorabilia.\n\nReally great stuff and sounding like it should.\n\nAny fans out there who were more open minded than me in the early to mid 80s?\n\n.sjb\n\nI really liked them back then, saw them several times and have Native Sons, State Of Our Union and Two-Fisted Tales on vinyl. Native Sons is the best IMO, plus it's got Gene Clark on it. Must get that box set... Christmas list I think.\n\nSid Griffin seems like a good guy, I said hello to him at a small festival when he was playing with The Coal Porters and he seemed genuinely pleased that I have a copy of his book about Gram Parsons. I don't think it was a big seller! Ages ago I saw him on a plane to the USA but he was asleep and I didn't disturb him. I was impressed when he stood up to get off the plane, his carry-on luggage was a mandolin\n\nOther bands in a similar vein from that era - Lone Justice / Maria McKee, The Rain Parade (more psych than country), Green On Red (more sloppy / Stonesy) ...\n\nI really liked them back then, saw them several times and have Native Sons, State Of Our Union and Two-Fisted Tales on vinyl.
