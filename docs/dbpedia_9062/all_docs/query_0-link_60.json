Featuring liner notes from the rhythm section of Tom Stevens and Greg Sowders as well as Pete Frame's amazingly informative Long Ryders Family Tree it includes over a dozen previously unseen photographs of the band in their heyday. This is the one Long Ryders CD to have if you only want one and an excellent introduction to the Founding Fathers of alt-country. Now officially Prima Records best selling CD (eat your heart out Danny & Dusty!)\n\nTracks: Looking For Lewis & Clark (long version) / Lights Of Downtown / Years Long Ago / Gunslinger Man / I Want You Bad / A Stitch In Time / Man Of Misery / If I Were A Bramble And You Were A Rose / Capturing The Flag (live) / State Of My Union / Final Wild Son / Ivory Tower / (Sweet) Mental Revenge / I Had A Dream / You Don't Know What's Right, You Don't Know What's Wrong / And She Rides / Masters Of War / I Can't Hide."
