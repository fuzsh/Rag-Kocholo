        "meta_description": "The Long Ryders are trailblazers who pioneered the alt-country sound in 1980&apos;s Los Angeles. Comprising Sid Griffin, Stephen McCarthy, Tom Stevens, and Greg Sowders, the band seamlessly blend folk, rock, and country influences, creating a distinctive jangle-pop sound. Their albums Native Sons and State of Our Union in the mid-80s showcased their prowess in songwriting and marked them as leaders in the roots rock movement. Despite commercial under-appreciation during their initial run, The Long Ryders’ impact on the alt-music scene was profound, influencing subsequent generations exploring the intersection of genres. Their enduring legacy as pioneers who bridged traditional Americana with alternative sounds continues to resonate, solidifying their place in the evolution of diverse American music landscapes. For this special show, The Long Ryders will be performing their classic album Native Sons in full, celebrating 40 years since its initial release. Please note, seating will be at the front, with standing space behind. Morton Valence support.  \"Grittily romantic slices of English life\" 5/5 NARC “Just about the most intriguing band on these shores” **** The Guardian UK “There is no one operating across quite the same terrain as they do” 8/10 Classic Rock",
