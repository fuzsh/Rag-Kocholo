        "text": "I am a late convert to the music of the Long Ryders. I actually became aware of the Long Ryders in the mid-1980's through the writings of the rock critic/Springsteen sycophant Dave Marsh. Back in that period, before I knew better, Marsh was my favorite rock critic and I accepted much of his opinions wholesale. He expressed negative comments about the Long Ryders agreeing to appear in a Miller beer commercial for monetary compensation and this was sufficient for me to avoid checking out their music. I continued my blissful ignorance of the Ryders until winter-spring 2014, when I read a alternative country essay that named the Ryders as one of its progenitors. (Actually I encountered the Ryders name when I purchased the 2003 Jayhawks album Rainy Day Music and read that its newest member was Stephen McCarthy, one of the primary songwriters, singers, and guitarists of the Long Ryders. However, this was not sufficient to prod me to check out their music.) I then read brief histories of the band on allmusic.com site and Wikipedia, followed by reviews of their discography on allmusic.com. I decided their Anthology compilation would be the best introduction to their music. Unfortunately, like much of their discography, Anthology is out of print. Fortunately a kind forum member sold me a like-new copy for a reasonable sum and I became an enthusiast after 1-2 listens. I was impressed by the band's individual and ensemble musicianship, the high quality of their songwriting individually and collaboratively, and their ability to play several styles--alt country, roots rock, traditional rock, power-pop, even psychedelia--effortlessly and well. In particular I liked their alt country-rock blend with punk rhythm energy and pace--particularly apparent on their cover of Mel Tillis's \"(Sweet) Mental Revenge\" and their own \"Run Dusty Run\".\n\nI have since acquired their three studio albums Native Sons, State of Our Union, and Two Fisted Tales, plus their posthumous \"odds'n'ends\" compilation Metallic BO, the live Three Minute Warnings, and their two live DVDs. With their 2nd and 3rd albums, the Long Ryders seem to have downplayed the alt country/roots rock aspect in favor of traditional rock and power-pop, but elements of the former still appear copiously in the songs. As I continue to listen to the Ryders, I have developed an appreciation for their lack of pretense and the integrity with which they write and play their music. I also appreciate that despite their lack of pretense, the Long Ryders exhibit a surprisingly sophisticated approach to their playing, arrangements, and production; this was evident even with their debut album with songs like \"Too Close to the Light\" and \"Time Keeps Traveling\".\n\nI am dismayed that this band never encountered sustained commercial success, only brief periods in the UK and Europe, and consequently ended their career after only 1 EP and three studio albums and 6 years. About the Miller beer commercial--I totally understand the Ryders need for money, a common malady among bands that have not reached superstar levels of success, and that it was survival, not greed that moved them to such deals. Anthology features many unreleased demos and outtakes, including about 6 for the Two Fisted Tales alone. This suggests the Long Ryders were prolific writers and could have recorded many more albums if their career had continued. The Long Ryders show no inclination for a sustained reunion or resuming their career--and honestly I don't think an large enough audience exists to justify this. Perhaps a movie or TV show or even a commercial will license one of their songs and lend it a profile high enough to justify reissuing the Long Ryders studio albums in expanded form and Anthology compilation. This in turn could induce the Long Ryders to undertake short tours in selected venues and introduce their music to a new audience and keep their music and legacy alive. This may also prompt renewing the box set project that has been postponed--Sid Griffin has indicated that it would feature many addtional previously unheard tracks not issued on Anthology or their expanded reissues. Of course, this is a pipe dream unless a catalyst such as I mentioned actually manifests to begin the process. In the meantime, all rock fans would do well to check out some of the Long Ryders music--individual tracks can be purchased and downloaded digitally via Amazon and iTunes.\n\nAny Long Ryders enthusiasts (and general rock fans), please feel free to chime in.\n\nI have liked the Longryders since the 'get go', they were part of the 'Paisley Underground' movement in Los Angeles in the early 80s?. I have all their albums too, including some dupes on U.K., Japan and German vinyl. I really like their 'Two Fisted Tales' LP although it seems that this one may not be as well thought of as the others, great songs and playing imho. I was playing 'TFT' just this past week."
