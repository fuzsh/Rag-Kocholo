        "text": "Armed with their sweaty six-strings, a huge record collection and a fervent belief in American Rock'n'Roll, the Long Ryders are taking on pretty synth Pop. And they might be winning.\n\nHis eyes were uncannily, startlingly blue — the blue of the sky above the Mojave desert, the blue of Levis faded by years of the harsh Western sun. They stared out of a face framed by bushy frontiersman sideburns and topped by a thatch of straight, wheat-coloured hair; just the sort you'd see peeping out from under a battered wide-brimmed hat. A craggy grin split the granite lines of his chin as he straightened his long, lean grey-clad legs and shifted the worn leather boots on the tabletop. The creases around his eyes, doubtless graven there by endless hours of scouring distant horizons, relaxed as he took his gaze from the view through the window to me.\n\n\"Okay,\" said Griffin, \"Shoot.\" For a moment I was tempted to whip out the pearl-handled Derringer and drill the lean stranger right between the eyes. Until I remembered who he was.\n\nNot to mention where he was. More Chiswick, W4 than Phoenix, Arizona; to be exact at the offices of Island Records, to whom Sid and his band, the Long Ryders, have recently signed for their second album. He isn't, despite an uncanny visual resemblance, a gunslinger of the Old West but instead a guitar picker of the New Wave of American Guitar Bands (abbreviate that if you can — NWOAGB. Sounds like someone swallowing a handbag).\n\nNonetheless, it seems that every other day there appears from the recess of the US backwoods some new pretenders to the throne of American Guitar Band. Some, like REM, take the tradition and bend it until it very nearly snaps. Some, like the Violent Femmes, strip down the format until its skeleton shows. And some, like the Long Ryders (but rarely as well) take the tradition and re-write it in vivid neon letters; intact but, like an Andy Warhol portrait, with all its details etched out in glowing wide-screen Technicolour.\n\nThe Long Ryders are well-equipped to take the archives of Americana and recycle them accurately, because in Sid they've got a historian and collector of impeccable pedigree; he's recently had published in book form a biography of the legendary Country Rock rebel Gram Parsons. In case you didn't know, Parsons with his band The Flying Burrito Brothers did more to give Stateside music a kick up the traditions than almost anybody; he spent most of his (short) life fighting the rhinestone-suits-and-Nashville rules of his Country contemporaries and dragging the genre kicking and screaming into the twentieth century. In the process, of course, he went through a lot of heartache and not a few varieties of excess — the culmination of both being his remarkably premature death and subsequent probable cremation by a friend with the aid of several gallons of petrol and a nearby desert. Of course (as always in the living-legend-snuffs-it business) there is still some lingering doubt about the manner, or indeed the actuality, of his death. Just like Jimi, Jim, or Marilyn, Gram Parsons' death has become as surrounded by myth his life. In real life, however, one unshakeable fact is that Parsons wrote and performed some of the best ever Country music and put thousands more on the right track.\n\nBut back in Chiswick, Sid Griffin is still sitting and talking about his influences — and his band. They are not few; Sid is a self-confessed Diskhead, a person who has albums the way the Onassis family have money. He has thousands, from James Brown to Dick Dale and the Surfaris. But a large percentage might well come under the category of Country Music, for that's the seam his band ploughs. So what's good about his much-reviled type of music — and why exhume it from its truck-drivin' man/home-lovin' woman niche and push it into today's ears?\n\n\"Welllll...\" he drawled laconically, \"we don't really see ourselves as a Country band as such. If you put us on stage with a couple of real good Country acts in front of an audience that knew about that type of music, we wouldn't stand a chance. They'd blow us into the next county. They'd cut us to shreds.\n\n\"We do take certain parts of the music, though — we share certain attitudes with Country bands, although by no means all of them. It's like — are the Pogues a straight Irish band?\n\n\"A lot of the superficial aspects of the music we've tossed out; we have a lot of energy in our rhythm section because we've heard The Clash and we've heard Never Mind The Bollocks; our attitude to our country, however, is the same.\n\n\"The Long Ryders don't use many standard Country and Western instruments like pedal steel or fiddle because once you get started on those you get tagged a Country act and you'll die a Country act. We do feel some affinity with Country and Western lyrically, but I'd feel very uneasy if we were to be given the title of straight Country. We're.... Countryesque.\"\n\n\"Some people spend money on girls and dope — I just spend it on guitars and records\""
