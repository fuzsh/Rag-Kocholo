        "text": "Good Sunday morning, all.\n\nLast week, U.S. Sen. Ed Markey, D-Mass., saw one of his signature legislative priorities — a measure updating data privacy rules that also aims to protect kids while they’re online — get over the goal line in the upper chamber.\n\nThe bill, which passed 91-3, has been pushed by parents of children who died by suicide after online bullying or have otherwise been harmed by online content, The Associated Press reported.\n\nIt would, among other things, force companies to take reasonable steps to prevent harm on online platforms frequently used by minors, requiring them to exercise “duty of care” and ensure that they generally default to the safest settings possible, the wire service further reported.\n\nThe bill faces an uncertain fate in the majority-Republican House, where Speaker Mike Johnson, R-LA, has not signaled whether he intends to bring it to a vote, NBC News reported.\n\nThe New York Times reported that the bill, dubbed “COPPA 2.0,\" faces stiff opposition from industry interests. There also are free speech concerns. That’s despite U.S. Surgeon General Vivek H. Murthy calling for tighter controls over social media because of the mental health threat it poses to many young Americans.\n\nThe conversation with Markey below has been lightly edited for content and clarity.\n\nQ: This bill attempts to hold social media companies more accountable for the harm they cause. As a practical matter, what will that look like under this legislation?\n\nMarkey: “This is the first tech legislation to pass in 26 years. The last time any tech legislation passed was ... the [first] Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act in 1998. Because of the tech industry, we could only [cover] kids under 13 [years old]. That was back when only birds tweeted, and the ‘Gram was a measurement of weight.”\n\n“The world is changing, and we need stronger protections. I introduced this bill 13 years ago. What my bill, passed in the Senate does, is ... it bans any targeted advertising to teenagers or children in our country; it will give parents and teens an ‘eraser button’ to erase the data companies gather, and it will require consent from teens before social media companies can gather their data in the first place.”\n\n“It has never been more important to protect our young people’s privacy.”\n\nQ: It’s unclear what will happen to the bill in the House. How do you convince people to support it and get past the industry’s significant objections?\n\nMarkey: “The Senate’s vote is the result of the relentless and passionate efforts of parents across the country. We would not be here without them. Those voices now will be heard in the House of Representatives. We can’t wait another generation for a safer and healthier ecosystem for kids under 17.\n\n“There’s a [mental health] crisis in this country, and it’s very important to get this bill onto President [Joe] Biden’s desk this year.”\n\nQ: Closer to home, a federal bankruptcy judge has approved Steward Health Care’s request to close Carney Hospital in Dorchester, and Nashoba Valley Medical Center in Ayer. There is some movement afoot from Boston City Council to save Carney. As a practical matter, what can you do, if anything, to save one or both of these facilities?\n\nMarkey: “Steward and private equity put Massachusetts into an impossible situation. They should pay for the consequences of their action. Every minute a patient has to wait longer; every job loss is due to their greed.\n\nRead More: Bill intended to avert a future Steward meltdown hits the wall on Beacon Hill\n\n“Steward must comply with the law,” mandating a 120-day notice period. “Their self-made crisis should not exempt them from how to address these hospital closures.”\n\nQ: Vice President Kamala Harris is expected to introduce her running mate at a rally in Philadelphia next week. One can draw a likely inference there about her pick. Who’s your favorite? She also locked up the nomination on Friday afternoon. What does she have to do now?\n\nMarkey: “In the same way that President Kennedy made the right decision in putting Lyndon B. Johnson on the ticket in 1960, and Joe Biden made the right decision in putting Kamala Harris on the ballot in 2020, I know that Vice President Harris will make the right decision on who she thinks is best on getting to 270 Electoral College votes.”\n\nRead More: VP Kamala Harris has enough Democratic delegate votes to be party’s nominee, DNC chair says\n\n“We need to have [the] ability to capture all the energy that already has been unleashed by the announcement of Kamala Harris as our candidate for president.\n\n“That means that young people, communities of color; women, especially women, are concerned about the Dobbs decision and access to abortion, all rise up to have a dramatic increase in the turnout at the polls.\n\n“This whole race has now been Etch-A-Sketched, and the energy and enthusiasm we saw in the first two weeks, will continue in the next 94 days. She is a historic candidate. She has the X factor, the ‘it’ quality that is exciting voters, especially independent voters. It will lead to victory in November, as long as we work hard to get that vote out.”\n\nQ: New York Times polling in June showed Democrats leading in key Senate races in Arizona, Nevada, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin. A separate analysis by CNN last month showed that nine of the top 10 seats likely to flip are held by Democrats (or independents who caucus with Democrats). Given that tough map, can Democrats hold onto the Senate? What will it take?\n\nMarkey: “We have an energized base, and will have to work hard to get the vote out ... We can’t rest until Election Day. We have to work hard.”\n\nQ: Are you watching the Olympics? Any favorite events?\n\nMarkey: “I am watching anything Massachusetts-related. I want more playing time for Jayson Tatum. [Massachusetts] has an incredible presence at the Olympics. It’s exciting.”\n\nThey said it\n\n“Absolutely. There’s a path for everything that doesn’t have a roll call.”\n\nMassachusetts House Speaker Ron Mariano, D-3rd Norfolk, to State House News Service, putting the best face he can on the Legislature finishing all the stuff it didn’t get done when formal voting sessions ended last week.\n\nA supreme challenge\n\nU.S. Rep. Jake Auchincloss, D-4th District, is all in on the U.S. Supreme Court reforms that President Joe Biden proposed last week.\n\nThe high court’s critics — and there are plenty of them these days — say the fixes, which include a constitutional amendment reversing the high court’s ruling on presidential immunity; term limits and a binding ethics code, are long overdue.\n\n“None of these reforms should really be partisan,” Auchincloss told MassLive during a wide-ranging interview last week. “... It’s not necessarily a Republican or Democratic thing to say that a judge shouldn’t have a financial interest in a case. It’s just good government.”\n\nThe Newton Democrat also said the fixes should be easy to implement.\n\nTransitioning judges to “senior status” once they hit a set number of years would preserve the lifetime appointment language in the U.S. Constitution, “so that would not require a constitutional amendment,” Auchincloss argued.\n\nThe immunity language might be a tougher lift. Though, he acknowledged, “the more likely scenario is it gets overturned by a later court.\n\n“But maybe pressure for a constitutional amendment would make it more likely to then get a Supreme Court that ruled differently down the line,” on the issue, he added.\n\nOn the calendar\n\nChess nerds, rejoice: “5 Days of Chess,” kicks off this Sunday and runs until Aug. 11, with events at City Hall Plaza in Boston, Mayor Michelle Wu’s office said in a statement.\n\nThe “free, all-ages series offering workshops led by Boston-based chess masters and an unrated chess tournament open to the public,” Wu’s office said.\n\nYou can find more information here.\n\nTurned up to 11\n\nAt the dawn of the 1980s, Steve Wynn fronted The Dream Syndicate, one of a passel of bands, broadly referred to as The Paisley Underground, that helped shape the sound of the American underground. Its informal membership also included The Long Ryders, Green on Red and The Bangles.\n\nIn the intervening 40 years, Wynn has been a prolific solo artist. He’s participated in such collaborations as The Baseball Project, which includes former members of R.E.M., and he’s revisited the Velvet Underground/Neil Young/Bob Dylan stylings of The Dream Syndicate with reunion albums and tours.\n\nWynn releases his first proper solo record in several years this summer with “Make It Right,” which serves as the de facto soundtrack for his newly published memoir “I Wouldn’t Say It If It Wasn’t True: A Memoir Of Life, Music, And The Dream Syndicate.”\n\nHere’s the first single from the LP: “Making Good on My Promises.”\n\nYour Sunday long read\n\nFriday marked the 100th anniversary of the birth of the legendary James Baldwin. It’s no understatement to say that the author and civil rights activist changed the course of American literature with such works as “Giovanni’s Room,” and “Sonny’s Blues,” among others.\n\nSo, instead of one big story, here are several pieces about Baldwin and his legacy, for you to consider this Sunday morning.\n\nFrom The Guardian, here’s a list of Baldwin’s key works, and where to start if you’re not already familiar with his writing.\n\nFrom Literary Hub, here are 10 reasons to love Baldwin on his 100th birthday.\n\nFrom NPR: The argument for why Baldwin remains relevant a century after his birth.\n\nThat’s it for this week. Have a peaceful Sunday. We’ll see you back here next week."
