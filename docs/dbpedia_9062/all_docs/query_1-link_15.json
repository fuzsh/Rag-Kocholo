        "text": "I saw the same tour at UCLA.\n\nSaw them twice, they played like mad dogs. I traded tapes with a west coast guy who knew Sid and had copied most of his live tapes. They've put out almost all the studio stuff still in the vaults, but they could issue lots of live shows and I'd buy all of them. But obviously no one gives a crap about them outside of sh.tv\n\nGotta laugh. Some Muppet abused me for showing too much love for The Long Ryders on that \"any love\" thread.\n\nI looked back at ‘Psychedelic Country Soul’ and see these five tracks as the highlights;\n\n‘Greenville’\n\n‘Molly Somebody’\n\n‘California State Line’\n\n‘The Sound’\n\n‘Psychedelic Country Soul’ (which…is pretty much exactly that!)\n\nCheck out the Stephen McCarthy and Carla Olsson release. They also have 3 videos on You Tube. In addition Stephen and another local Richmond guitarist, Charles Arthur have a video on You Tube made at the VA Museum of Fine Arts highlighting guitars and doing some picking. Stephen and the band are looking forward to the UK tour.\n\nNice! Am listening now\n\nAnd Jason & the Scorchers.\n\nI like the cow punk term better than alt-country …and much better than Americana (which I don’t like at all as it covers too much territory).\n\nI'd wanna add \"Let It Fly\"- the Peterson sisters (from the Bangles) sounded great\n\nAnd Dash Rip Rock, whose new album is even called \"Cowpunk\"\n\nI was a big fan of The Long Ryders, along with the other \"Paisley Underground\" bands, based on my love for The Byrds. Basically anything with a review that used the phrase \"Byrds-like\". There was an influential article on these bands in Sounds, I think. I had 10-5-60, Native Sons and State Of Our Union, and although Native Sons is usually the critical and fan favourite, and despite the presence of the great Gene Clark on that album, my favourite of theirs is State Of Our Union.\n\n+1. I’ve included this on my Limited Top 100 albums list. (‘Limited’ means only one album permitted per artist)\n\nI really feel like \"alt-country\" and \"Americana\" are terms for country music that's being played by people too snobby to admit they're playing country music. Either that or they're trying to appeal to people who don't want to be seen buying country music.\n\nI think a lot of it is making a distinction between these artists and who/what you will hear on country radio\n\nThere's no such ting as too much...\n\nA good friend of mine (who will join me to see The Sadies next weekend) used to work with Sid at JEM Records. I got to chat with Sid a couple times and we saw the band live at The Music Machine, The Roxy, etc. Got all their records and I'm looking forward to their new album. Hope they tour the US again.\n\nThat's certainly possible.\n\nThis is how the Roots Music Report divides it up:\n\nSub Genres -\n\nAcoustic Blues\n\nAlt. Rock\n\nAmericana Country\n\nBlues Rock\n\nClassic Blues\n\nContemporary Bluegrass\n\nContemporary Blues\n\nContemporary Folk\n\nHot Country\n\nRoots Rock\n\nSoul\n\nSoul Blues\n\nTraditional Bluegrass\n\nWhat’s the difference between ‘Americana Country’ and ‘Roots Rock’?\n\nCurrently, Americana top album is Peter Rowan ‘Calling You From My Mountain’ vs Roots Rock top album Justin Saladino Band ‘Honest Lies.’ I don’t know either so have no idea if that’s an obvious distinction or not.\n\nAnyway, returning to the Long Ryders, I’m really liking these first two singles from the soon-to-be-released album.\n\nIt's what's inside the box that counts. Not the label on the box or whether it's in the right box or not.\n\nYou also do not have to like everything in the box.\n\nListening to that McCarthy/Olson album it really reminds me of Rodney Crowell both in sound & style.\n\nIf you haven't heard Rodney Crowell do yourself a favour.\n\nThe new album “September November” has just dropped through my letterbox!\n\nI’m on track 3 and it is sounding mighty fine. I’m sure Tom will be a miss overall but he’s here in spirit.\n\nLove Long Ryders.\n\nWe first saw them, along with Green On Red - I think both were opening for X at the Roxy. This was before Native Sons had been released. So probably 1982? Anyhow, they were very, very rough live.\n\nWe saw them many times after that and watched them transform into a really good club act (along with Rain Parade, The Bangles and Dream Syndicate)."
