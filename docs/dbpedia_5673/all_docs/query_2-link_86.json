The magic, the glow, and the rush will last me the rest of my life.\"\n\nThe Bee Gees grew up in Manchester and Brisbane and tasted chart success in the 1960s, before going on to record the best-selling Saturday Night Fever soundtrack in 1977.\n\nSir Ringo's honour for services to music - given under his real name, Richard Starkey - was leaked before the announcement. It comes 20 years after Paul McCartney was knighted and adds to the 1965 MBE received by all four Beatles.\n\nThe Los Angeles-based musician said: \"It's great! It's an honour and a pleasure to be considered and acknowledged for my music and my charity work, both of which I love. Peace and love.\" The Cavern Club in his hometown of Liverpool, where the Fab Four started life, described the knighthood as \"long overdue\".\n\nSir Paul tweeted his congratulations to his \"best pal\".\n\nAllow Twitter content?\n\nThis article contains content provided by Twitter .

He is best known for his children's novels, including War Horse and Why the Whales Came.\n\nHe says his knighthood gives him a platform to advance one of his main passions: \"The opportunity to talk about children's literature and how really important that is to our young people growing up today.\n\n\"They learn so much - not just the spelling and the punctuation, all that's very important - but what you learn from a book is understanding and empathy.\n\n\"You learn to understand about other people, people of different colour, of different religion, of people of a different age - and reading can do that. So it's wonderful to be in a position to maybe do that more powerfully.\"\n\nThere are MBEs for BBC radio presenters Linda McAuley, who hosts Radio Ulster consumer show On Your Behalf and is recognised for services to consumers, and BBC London's Eddie Nestor for services to radio and charity.\n\nBus maker\n\nNick Clegg, who lost his Sheffield Hallam seat in the general election, is knighted for political and public service alongside several former and serving MPs, while fellow Lib Dem Jo Swinson is made a CBE.\n\nThe former deputy PM said he was \"grateful\" for the knighthood which \"belongs as much to my team in government as it does to me\".\n\nHe added: \"The knighthood does not mean I will serve in the House of Lords. My aversion to unelected legislatures remains.\"\n\nConservative MPs Graham Brady - the chairman of the influential backbench 1922 Committee - Geoffrey Clifton-Brown and Christopher Chope are knighted, and Cheryl Gillan made a dame.
