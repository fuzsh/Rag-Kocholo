        "text": "The UK's next Prime Minister Rishi Sunak has taken office after becoming the only candidate left at the end of the leadership race.\n\nFormer PM declared himself out despite insisting he had the required 100 votes to put himself forward. Penny Mordaunt failed to meet the number and stepped aside.\n\nAt 42, Sunak has become the youngest Prime Minister in 100 years and the first of South Asian descent.\n\nHe became Chancellor of the Exchequer on 13 February 2020 and saw his popularity surge during the Covid-19 pandemic by introducing a raft of unprecedented measures including the Job Support Scheme to support the UK economy battered by repeated lockdowns and continued restrictions.\n\nHe introduced a hike in National Insurance to raise £13billion to help clear the NHS backlog due to Covid and which would then be named the Health and Social Care levy.\n\nBut the move was scrapped in Kwasi Kwarteng's mini Budget, a decision upheld by the current Chancellor Jeremy Hunt.\n\nBusinessLive takes a look at Rishi Sunak's biography and career so far.\n\nREAD NEXT: A profile on Jeremy Hunt, the Chancellor who will do 'whatever it takes'\n\nBiography\n\nBirthplace: Rishi was born on May 12, 1980 in Southampton to mother Usha who, according to the biography Going For Broke: The Rise of Rishi Sunak by Michael Ashcroft, worked as manager of Weston Pharmacy at the time, while father Yashvir was a GP whose surgery was on Raymond Road, Shirley.\n\nEducation:\n\nA student at world-famous public boarding school Winchester College in Hampshire, he went on to study Politics, Philosophy and Economics at Oxford University. He was also a Fulbright Scholar at Stanford University (USA) where he studied for his MBA\n\nFamily:\n\nHe is married to Akshata Murthy, the daughter of Indian billionaire Narayana Murthy, one of India’s richest men. Rishi and Akshata met at Stanford, they married in 2009 and have two daughters Krishna and Anoushka.\n\nAccording to The Express, Akshata's own personal fortune is estimated to be at £430million, making her richer than the Queen whose personal wealth spans £350million. She holds a number of directorships and shareholdings including in the family IT company Infosys. Akshata runs her own fashion label Akshata Designs.\n\nIn April this year, she announced she would pay UK tax on her overseas income after a furious backlash over her non-dom tax status.\n\nAkshata Murty, who owns £700million worth of shares in Infosys, Ms Murty said she did not wish her ' tax status to be a distraction' for my husband or to affect my family.\n\nShe announced she would pay UK tax on all her foreign income, backdated to the last tax year.\n\nNeed to know:\n\nTatler reports Rishi has been dubbed the 'Maharaja of the Dales' in refence to his Indian heritage and Yorkshire home.\n\nA Star Wars fan, he likes keeping fit, cricket, football and movies in his spare time\n\nRishi's financial affairs came under scrutiny in 2020 after The Guardian reported that the multimillion-pound portfolio of shareholdings and directorships held by his wife and her family were not declared in the official register of ministers’ interests. The Treasury said all the proper procedures for declaring interests had been followed.\n\nHe stood down as Chancellor in July 2022, a move that sealed the end of Johnson's premiership.\n\nCareer so far:\n\nAfter graduating, he worked for Goldman Sachs, working in hedge fund management before setting up his own business, Theleme Partners, a private investment partnership in 2010. The Express reports it started with an initial fund of £536million.\n\nRishi was elected Conservative MP for Richmond (Yorks) in May 2015 and served as a Parliamentary Private Secretary at the Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy from June 2017 until his ministerial appointment in 2018 as Parliamentary Under Secretary of State at the Ministry of Housing, Communities and Local Government.\n\nHe was Chief Secretary to the Treasury from 24 July 2019 to 13 February 2020 when he was appointed Chancellor of the Exchequer.\n\nHe was runner up to Liz Truss in the first Tory leadership campaign after Boris Johnson stood down. He promised to sort out the worsening state of the UK economy and warned against the 'chaos' that would result from Truss' promised tax cuts."
