        "text": "New Delhi: It has not been long since Liz Truss was elected as the Prime Minister of the United Kingdom. But on Thursday, Truss said she was resigning from the post, brought down by her economic programme that sent shockwaves through the markets and divided her Conservative Party just six weeks after she was appointed. Speaking outside the door of her Number 10 Downing Street office, she said, “I recognise though, given the situation, I cannot deliver the mandate on which I was elected by the Conservative Party. I have therefore spoken to His Majesty the King to notify him that I am resigning as leader of the Conservative Party.” She added, “This morning I met the chairman of the 1922 Committee, Sir Graham Brady. We’ve agreed that there will be a leadership election to be completed within the next week. This will ensure that we remain on a path to deliver our fiscal plans and maintain our country’s economic stability and national security.”\n\nWho is Penny Mordaunt?\n\nConservative lawmakers are considering British Indian former Chancellor Sunak, who was the front-runner with Truss in the PM election, and third-place finisher Penny Mordaunt, who received the most votes within the parliamentary party, as possible replacement options.\n\nMordaunt was born on March 4, 1973, in Torbay, Devon. His father was a former paratrooper, and she was named after the Arethusa-class cruiser HMS Penelope. Her mother was a special needs teacher at several Purbrook schools. Through her mother, she is a relative of Philip Snowden, the first Labour Chancellor of the Exchequer. The actress Dame Angela Lansbury was her grandmother’s cousin, and she is thus distantly related to the former Labour leader George Lansbury.\n\nAt the age of 15 years, Mordaunt lost her mother to breast cancer. In the next year, her father was also diagnosed with cancer, from which he recovered. Mordaunt, to pay for her studies, worked in a Johnson & Johnson factory and became a magician’s assistant to Will Ayling. Her interest in politics developed while working in hospitals and orphanages in Romania while that country was in the aftermath of the 1989 revolution.\n\nMordaunt read philosophy at the University of Reading, graduating in 1995 with upper second-class honours, and also, she was the first member of her family to attend university. Mordaunt was an active participant in student politics and served as president of the Reading University Students’ Union.\n\nEarly career and George Bush\n\nMordaunt’s initial career revolved around public relations in various sectors. After working in various high-profile roles, in 2000, she worked briefly as Head of Foreign Press for George W Bush’s presidential campaign. Mordaunt worked for the Bush campaign again in 2004.\n\nIn November 2003, Mordaunt was selected as a Conservative candidate to contest Portsmouth North in the 2005 general election. She lost to Labour candidate Sarah McCarthy-Fry by 1,139 votes but was again selected in January 2006 to contest Portsmouth North at the 2010 general election. At the election, she won the seat with an 8.6 per cent swing from Labour, giving her a 7,289 majority. She was re-elected in 2015, 2017, and 2019 general elections.\n\nPenny Mordaunt as minister\n\nIn 2014, former PM David Cameron appointed Mordaunt as Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Decentralisation at the Department for Communities and Local Government. While serving in that role, she was accused by the Fire Brigades Union “of misleading MPs over assurances given to firefighters from fire authorities regarding what would happen to their pensions if they fail fitness tests”.\n\nMordaunt was appointed Minister of State for the Armed Forces in May 2015, becoming the first woman to hold the post.\n\nIn July 2016, following Theresa May’s appointment as Prime Minister, Mordaunt was appointed Minister of State for Disabled People, Work and Health at the Department for Work and Pensions. She became Minister for Women and Equalities in April 2018, and in July, she became the first minister to use sign language in the House of Commons.\n\nOn May 1, 2019, Mordaunt was appointed as the first female Secretary of State for Defence following the dismissal of Gavin Williamson. In July 2022, Mordaunt launched an unsuccessful bid to be the next Conservative leader and consequently UK Prime Minister.\n\nOn September 6, 2022, Mordaunt was appointed Leader of the House of Commons and Lord President of the Council. As Lord President of the Council, she presided over the Accession Ceremony of King Charles III.\n\nStance regarding Brexit\n\nMordaunt was a supporter of Brexit, and during the referendum campaign, she said the UK did not have a veto to Turkey joining the European Union. This is a provision of the Treaty on the European Union, and hence, Mordaunt was severely criticised and was accused of ‘lying’ over the matter. Mordaunt said in her defence, that the provision of veto, despite being there, could not be used because “David Cameron gave an undertaking that he would support their accession and having given that undertaking to a NATO country, he would not have been able to walk away.” In 2022, she defended her 2016 comments during her Conservative Party leadership campaign."
