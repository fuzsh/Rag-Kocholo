        "text": "Do you have a desire to create a legacy? Footprints, a path, for others to follow? In helping clients write their authentic résumés, we begin with questions like that. I’ve found that setting goals in terms of abundance, energy, and strengths is most effective. Often people equate legacy as a goal for the autumn of life. But the idea of legacy can be a fuel for all seasons in the career journey. An idea that creates an abundance of enthusiasm, satisfaction, and joy on the job, day to day. An idea worth contemplating. Here, our Transportation Secretary, Pete Buttigieg, addresses the idea of legacy. #career #legacy #energy #goals #petebuttigieg #transportation #ideation"
