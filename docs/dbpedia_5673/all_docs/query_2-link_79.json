        "text": "(Before I begin, I am American so this is way out of my league despite following cricket as a sport for some time now. So with that said, I want to thank @Sarthak for helping me out by providing some background info for this series. I'm also setting this story from 1890 to 1899 as its first chapter. Hence why I'm here. Critiques are welcome and any advice would be welcome. I'm nervous but worth at least getting the first chapter out. Now on with the show.)\n\n(I am just throwing this out there, Some of the people are fictional while most are not and are named after real players from around that time. Same with the places the teams played on.)\n\n“We were so close. MCC wanted us to join yet Canada vetoed are way in. Their loss was our opportunity to grow” George Patterson (1920)\n\n“The 50-overs league that USCA established in 1890 was a brilliant move by them and helped submit that cricket can coexist with Baseball in America.” Bart King (1915)\n\n“Cricket is a fantastic game but needed to change to professionalism and adapt to what Baseball was doing. If not then the damage would be permanent.” Charles Wright* (1910)\n\nWhen the USA was rejected to join the MCC in 1886 thanks to the efforts of the Cape Colony, New South Wales, and mainly Canada. It was seen as a sad reminder at the time that they were outcasts. The United States was not an Imperial Colony to the United Kingdom yet it has enjoyed Cricket despite creating its own game called Baseball.\n\nIt was faster than traditional Five-Day Overs, games could be played in one day and fans left happy knowing they enjoyed the match. For years, players have been wanting a 50 or 60-over version of the game to complete in just one day. However, the MCC members rejected the idea. With the rejection of joining the MCC by those three nations. The USA was left with no choice. It was time for Cricket to go Professional and be shortened to 50 overs.\n\nThe formation of a professional cricket league was kept secret from the rest of the cricket-playing world. George Patterson, considered one of the best cricketers of his time, would help spearhead the idea. However, it took a millionaire, Charles Wright, to round up a group of investors to spend money on a new, professional cricket league. The new league would be considered a test by the ones who invested in the league and by the cricketers who partake in this new competition.\n\n“They decision to create the National Cricket League to help promote a shorter form of cricket while reeducating the American people that cricket is an enjoyable spectator sport.” JB Thayer Sr. (1912)\n\nNational Cricket League Original Teams:\n\nStaten Island Gothams (Walker Park)\n\nPhiladelphia Rovers (Germantown Cricket Club Ground)\n\nNew Haven Olympic (Edgewood Park Cricket Grounds)\n\nManhattan Cricket Club (Randel Island Park)\n\nBronx Highlanders (Randle Island Park)\n\nBoston Bluecaps (Boston City Grounds)\n\nThe Season, which first lasted between late June to mid-July would see at least a total of 20-day games. Ten home and ten away games for each team. In the end, only the top two teams competed for the NCL President Cup.\n\nThe six clubs were mostly to demonstrate the game to the northeastern United States. While Baseball has a firm grasp on most of the United States. Cricket still has a foothold in the northeast. A grassroots effort that is about to pay off. Before the season could begin, the teams gathered their best players and told them they were going professional. Despite some rejection from some players. New players saw this as an opportunity to play cricket and make an alright to good living.\n\nA week before the season could begin, the NCL held its first exhibition in front of a paying crowd of 5,000 spectators at the Manhattan Cricket Club grounds, Randel Island Park. The two teams were made of the best players of the six teams in the new league. The fine Saturday midday game which lasted around till evening saw some good action despite the fans being more or less new to the 50-overs rules. The officials handed out pamphlets describing the new version of cricket to the attendants who arrived.\n\nGame Results: NCL Team A XI defeated NCL Team B XI by 2 Wickets.\n\nNCL Team A XI Roster:\n\nDavid E Walker\n\nHyder Clarke\n\nMark Cameron\n\nFranklin Brown Sr.\n\nJoe Baily\n\nPeter J Patterson\n\nJW Dutton\n\nLester Heys\n\nGreg Chambers\n\nJohn Bart King\n\nJon Martin\n\nNCL Team B XI Roster:\n\nWJ Kennedy\n\nEric Wood\n\nDevin Little\n\nPW Clark\n\nLouis Griffen\n\nEddie Muir\n\nReese T. McColn\n\nTJ Franklin\n\nJohn Kelly\n\nDavid Kelly\n\nJacob Forbes\n\nDespite some nonbelievers to this new form of cricket, the exhibition game was a resounding success. The season would take place one week later on June 23rd, 1890 in front of a crowd of 5,000 cricket fans in Roandel Island Park to see the Boston Bluecaps, led by captain Louis Griffen challenge Manhattan C.C. led by exhibition MVP John Bart King. Boston would lose the first game by 6 wickets against Manhattan. Boston would come back the next day and revenge their loss by 8 wickets.\n\nMatch 1 & 2 Results:\n\nManhattan C.C. 180/4 - 170/0\n\nBoston Bluecaps: 181/0 - 174/2\n\nThe other game was between the Philadelphia Rovers and Statan Island Gothams at a well-packed crowd in Walker Park. The Rovers were led by Franklin Brown Sr. who was a member of the Germantown Cricket Club but left to join the Rovers. The Gothams were led by JW Dutton who wasn’t a member of the Staten Island Cricket Clubs before but would sign on to play for the Gothams before the season began. Both games in the series were won by the Rovers, Match One by 6 wickets and the second by 4 wickets.\n\nMatch 1 & 2 Results:\n\nPhiladelphia Rovers 174/2 - 166/6\n\nStaten Island Gothams 170/0 - 165/9\n\nNCL National Cricket League 1890 Final Standing:\n\nManhattan C.C. 16-04-00\n\nPhiladelphia Rovers 14-04-02\n\nStaten Island Gotham 10-06-04\n\nNew Haven Olympic 09-11-00\n\nBoston Bluecaps 06-10-02\n\nBronx Highlanders 04-16-00\n\nThe two teams were set. Manhattan and Philadelphia were the best teams in the league despite the two ties from the Rovers against the Bluecaps and Gothams respectively. The finals were played in the Germantown Cricket Club Grounds in Philadelphia on August 11, 1890. A crowd of loyal cricket fans and newcomers came and left home happy as the outcome of this one-game playoff series saw the Rovers defeat Manhattan by 80 runs. The Rovers were crowned the first NCL Presidents Cup Champions.\n\nPresident Cup Finals Results:\n\nManhattan C.C. 88/7\n\nPhiladelphia Rovers 168/7\n\nThe first season was a surprising and welcome success for the USCA. Fan outcomes were manageable and the finals saw new fans cheering for both the Rovers and Manhattan. Even younger fans saw the game since the NCL allowed children to watch games for free. Despite the success, Baseball was still beating Cricket the fact that Manhattan, Bronx, and Philadelphia had decent-sized grounds. Teams like Boston and New Haven have been playing in parks that were modified to create cricket grounds inside the parks.\n\nAnother issue was, the MCC. The secret wouldn’t last and the MCC, led by Canada and New South Wales, would issue a ban on playing with American Cricketers and Teams until the new league was abolished. Despite this, England, Ireland, and Scotland would ignore this. The MCC was divided and would take years before things would be settled. Till then, England clubs would tour America playing the 50-overs test matches against both the teams in the NCL and an American XI team made up of NCL best players over the coming year.\n\nA few weeks before the 1891 season could begin. It was announced that a team of English Cricketers would travel to the United States to hold exhibition matches against the NCL at season's end. Dubbed by the press as a “Challenge Series” It was decided that the NCL best team would take on an English team led by Lord Hawke.\n\nThe season continued having the same six teams for the second year. The only change where the Staten Island Gothams relocating to Livingston Field, which would become their main grounds while in the league. The teams stayed the same and on July 10th, 1891, one month ahead from the last season, the National Cricket League would start its second season in Staten Island as the Gothams had their first NCL match at the Livingston Field against defending champions Philadelphia Rovers.\n\nBoth games were close affairs, but the series would end in a draw for both teams winning one game each.\n\nMatch 1 Results: Rovers won by 27 runs\n\nPhiladelphia: 226/4\n\nStaten Island: 199/8\n\nMatch 2: Gothams won by 24 Runs\n\nPhiladelphia: 168/0\n\nStaten Island: 192/8\n\nWhile that game was going on. Two other games were played on that day. In Manhattan Randel Island Park, both New York teams went right at it in front of a well-crowded group of supporters for both teams. Manhattan, led by captain John Bark King, would end up edging out the Highlanders in both games. While that was going on, the New Haven Olympics took on Boston in a mostly one-sided affair for Boston. New Haven didn’t have a good season this year and despite having some talent, was lacking in fielding and especially batting.\n\nNCL National Cricket League 1891 Final Standing:\n\nPhiladelphia Rovers 18-02-00\n\nStaten Island Gothams 17-03-00\n\nManhattan C.C. 17-02-01\n\nBronx Highlanders 12-07-01\n\nBoston Bluecaps 10-10-00\n\nNew Haven Olympics 5-15-00\n\nIn a surprise from the season before. Manhattan would fail to reach the finals. Drawing a game from hated rivals the Bronx Highlanders just as the season was ending. This led the Gothams would snatch second place behind Philadelphia and a shot for the President's Cup. Boston ended where they were last season but with a better record this time. New Haven would have an awful season this year ending up in last place.\n\nThe President’s Cup finals took place once again in the Germantown Cricket Club Grounds on September 5th, 1891. Philadelphia was the heavy favorite this time against Staten Island. The Gothams were still ready for a fight. As the crowds gather. Lord Hawke’s group of cricketers would also be in attendance. One of the players for Hawke’s XI was Sammy Woods from Australia. He was, at this point, playing for Somerset Cricket Club. He was a last-minute addition to the roster.\n\n“I happened to take a chance to go with Lord Hawke to America to watch this new form of cricket being played there. I was shocked to realize that young children were allowed to watch for free. The crowd was like a circus with fans of both teams supporting them. At first, I thought this was like this Baseball that I heard of, but then the game went on, and I came to the conclusion that this would turn out to be a good thing for Cricket in the end.” Sammy Woods (1929)\n\nDespite Staten Island trying to tie the game up by the end, Philadelphia would come out victorious. The Rovers became the first two-time President’s Cup champions. Philadelphia captain Franklin Brown Sr. would win the first MVP in league history.\n\n1891 President Cup Finals Results: Rovers won by 3 runs\n\nStaten Island Gothams: 159/8\n\nPhiladelphia Rovers: 163/9\n\nPhiladelphia would have the honor of taking on Lord Hawke’s XI in Randel Island Park in New York City. It was decided to play on neutral ground for the two-game series before the season began. This would also be considered the first ODI Test Match in the history of Cricket as Philadelphia Rover was representing both the NCL and the United States over Lord Hawke team mostly of amateurs from across England.\n\nLord Hawke’s XI Roster for the Test:\n\nLord Hawke (Captain)\n\nHerbie Hewett\n\nGeorge Hillyard\n\nJohn Hornsby\n\nKingsmill Key\n\nKenneth McAlpine\n\nHenry Milles\n\nGeorge Ricketts\n\nViscount Throwley\n\nCharles Wreford-Brown\n\nSammy Woods\n\nCharles Wright (wicket-keeper)\n\nThe First One Day International Test took place on September 25, 1891, in front of a large crowd in Randel Island Park. Before the event, the NCL investors would renovate the grounds to accommodate the large crowds by adding new seating and a new grandstand for the press. The game was promoted for months beforehand, which helped see a crowd of 5,500 paying fans watch Philadelphia take on Lord Hawke's team.\n\nDespite their all, Philadelphia would end up winning game one by 102 runs. The second game, which took place the following day saw Lord Hawke’s team barely winning over the Rovers by 17 runs. Despite the loss, Philadelphia, and by extension the NCL and USCA, would end up being the real winners. Sammy Woods, who led the charge that helped his team win game two, would be the first English player to sign for a team in the NCL. Woods would sign with Staten Island which would be a good thing for the Gothams throughout the rest of the 1890’s.\n\nMatch 1 Results: Philadelphia won by 102 runs\n\nLord Hawke’s XI: 186/0\n\nPhiladelphia: 288/5\n\nMatch 2 Results: Lord Hawke’s XI won by 17 runs\n\nLord Hawke’s XI: 129/8\n\nPhiladelphia: 112/0\n\nLord Hawke’s team would continue playing regular test matches against amateur cricket teams across the United States. However, the series with Philadelphia would prove to be a success for the NCL and its growth in the United States. Baseball was still king, but Cricket was seen as a worthy alternative to it. Meanwhile, back in London, the Marylebone Cricket Club members were still observed in the new league. While the MCC was still divided between the NCL and the 50-overs cricket. Most of the members knew that they were doing something right. The test matches they were doing beforehand were long and while professionalism was still seen as taboo, it might work to the MCC member's benefit.\n\nNew South Wales, who vetoed USA entry into the MCC in 1886, would be the first to adopt the 50-overs, though for test matches for now. NSW decided to send an open letter to the USCA to see if they would be willing to play a One-Day International test series against them with the best cricketers from the NCL. The USCA accepted and agreed that the first game would take place on January 9th,1892.\n\nFor the first time in United States Cricket history, a team of NCL all-stars traveled to Australia to challenge the New South Wales Cricket team in front of a large crowd at the Association Cricket Ground (known today as the Sydney Cricket Grounds). The series would be the first One-Day International for the United States outside North America and the first of many 50-over tests cricket matches with both teams. While traveling to New South Wales, the NCL All-Stars took a slight detour to Auckland, New Zealand to have a practice series with a group of New Zealand cricketers living there.\n\nThe New Zealand cricketers would adapt to the new game quickly despite losing a test match to the Americans. The score is lost to time sadly but Captain Franklin Brown Sr. and wicket-keeper John Kelly would say later on that the New Zealanders enjoyed the quicker pace of the game. Once they arrived in Sydney, the NCL All-Stars would be welcomed by the New South Wales Cricket Association secretary John Portus and New South Wales captain PS McDonnell. NCL founders George Patterson and Charles Wright greeted them along with the NCL All-Stars.\n\nThe night before the test series. Charles Wright asked NSWCA John Portus about creating a 50-overs league for Australia. Portus, after hearing about the successful two seasons for the NCL over in America, would proclaim that if the series becomes a success with the spectators watching at the SCG then will consider creating a national league for Australia.\n\nNCL Cricket All-Star XI Roster:\n\nFranklin Brown Sr. (Captain)\n\nJohn Bart King\n\nEric Wood\n\nGreg Chambers\n\nCL Bixby\n\nJW Dutton\n\nLouis Griffen\n\nJacob Forbes\n\nCharles J Rhodes (replacement player for WJ Kennedy) (First test match)\n\nHyder Clarke\n\nJohn Kelly (Wicket-Keeper)\n\nNew South Wales XI Roster:\n\nPS McDonnell (Captain)\n\nAlick Bannerman\n\nSammy Jones\n\nHarry Donnan\n\nCharlie Turner\n\nAlfred Clarke\n\nSyd Gregory\n\nJohn Gould\n\nSydney Callaway\n\nPercie Charlton\n\nIke Wales (Wicket-Keeper)\n\nJanuary 9th,1892, first day of the two-day ODI Test Series, and both teams were ready. After a coin flip, the NCL All-Stars would bowl first. A crowd of 8,000 plus watched onward to see their team take on the Americans. The two games were back-to-back. The crowd enjoyed both games, as the shorter format would help keep the spectators more engaged on the field.\n\nDespite a solid series from both teams, the series ended in a draw as they each won a match.\n\nMatch 1 Results: NCL All-Stars won by 40 runs.\n\nNCL All-Stars XI: 194/5\n\nNew South Wales: 154/4\n\nMatch 2 Results: NSW won by 3 wickets\n\nNCL All-Stars XI: 192/8\n\nNew South Wales: 196/7\n\nThe series was a resounding success for both the NCL and for New South Wales Cricket Association. That night, John Porter announced that the New South Wales Cricket Association would adopt the 50-overs for their national league. That night saw the creation and birth of the NSW Cricket League and the formation of six clubs first its first season next summer.\n\nNSW Cricket League founding teams:\n\nEastern Suburbs\n\nSouth Sydney\n\nNorth Sydney\n\nNewcastle\n\nNewtown\n\nParramatta\n\nMonths later, a group of Irish Cricketers, known as the Gentlemen of Ireland, would issue a challenge to cricket teams across the United States. They would, however, not challenge the National Cricket League's best team. That honor would go to Canada thanks to the formation of the Canadian Cricket Association earlier in the year. While they haven’t created their own national league just yet, they would issue an open challenge to the President’s Cup winners to their own version of the England/Australia Ashes Series. Dubbed by the press in both Canada and the United States as “The Border Wars” up till the First World War and then the CAN-AM Cup starting in 1915 onward.\n\n(Decided to split this chapter in two due to how long this chapter will be once completed. While I will work on the chapter tonight, I will upload it tomorrow afternoon once I have the time. I really hope everyone is enjoying this series, I'm happy to work on it as it is something different sports-wise from what I have done before. Anyways, thanks for reading and I will be back tomorrow for the next chapter to continue where we left off.)\n\nWith the success of the Australian Tour, the National Cricket League returned for a third season with some minor changes this time around. Major news as the Staten Island Gotham signed its first foreign player in Australian Sammy Woods who played in last year's Lord Hawke's XI team. The Gotham, eyes by the press, were seen as the team to beat this year. Meanwhile, Philadelphia, the defending champions, were coming in a close second with Manhatten C.C. behind them. The Bronx Highlanders, Boston Bluecaps, and New Haven were seen as the bottom three teams for this season by the preseason predictions by the NY Times.\n\nSpeaking of New Haven, after another rough season the year prior, the team would rebrand for this season as the New Haven Stars. Despite this, the team was seen as dysfunctional as usual for the league.\n\nThe first game of the 1892 Regular Season began on July 8th, 1892, as the New Haven Stars took on Boston Bluecaps in front of a small crowd of 2,000 fans at Edgewood Park. Surprisingly, that was their normal attendance. Despite being a problematic team on the field, the fans supported the team and were loyal to them till the end. This was a good thing as despite a rough start would win both their games in the series against Boston.\n\nMatch 1 Results: New Haven won by 3 wickets\n\nBoston 126/0\n\nNew Haven 127/7\n\nMatch 2 Results: New Haven won by 23 runs\n\nBoston 127/0\n\nNew Haven 150/9\n\nWhile that was going on, Staten Island Gothams would take on Manhatten in a fierce contest on both days. The Gothams would end up tying the first game and ending it as a draw against Manhatten. Match Two would see the Gothams winning the game by 8 wickets against John Bart King-led squad. The final games of the first week saw Saw the Bronx Highlanders travel to Philadelphia to challenge the defending champions Rovers. Not much of a contest as the Highlanders would lose both games. Match One by 6 wickets and the second by 4 wickets.\n\n1892 NCL Season Final Standing:\n\nPhiladelphia Rovers 17-03-00\n\nStaten Island Gothams 16-02-01\n\nManhatten C.C. 14-05-01\n\nNew Haven Stars 12-08-00\n\nBoston Bluecaps 09-11-00\n\nBronx Highlanders 04-16-00\n\nPhiladelphia winning the regular season was no surprise despite the Gothams being close behind. Manhattan would once again miss the championship but their two losses to New Haven near season end would end up costing them. New Haven became the underdog team, coming close in most of their games against the Rovers and Manhatten. Boston would improve slightly but still finish fifth this year. Bad news came for the Bronx Highlanders as their ownership group, Stanley & Sons, would sell the club to a New York native named Charles Ebbets. Ebbets and his group of investors, who also owned the Brooklyn Bridegrooms of the National League, relocated the team to Washington Park. Washington Park would be retrofitted to become the first dual-use stadium in the United States.\n\nOver the years, Washington Park would just become home to cricket as the Brooklyn Dodgers Baseball club would relocate to the recently completed Ebbets Fields nearby by 1913.\n\nFor the second in three years, the NCL President’s Cup Finals were played at the Germantown Cricket Club Grounds in Philadelphia on September 9th, 1892. A larger-than-normal crowd of 7,000 spectators gathered to watch the hometown Rovers repeat as champions. The Gothams were ready to dethrone them and this final would be considered, by historians, as one of the best cricket matches ever played in North America. Despite electing to bat first after the coin flip, the Gothams would end up dethroning the two-time champions in front of their supporters.\n\n1892 NCL President’s Cup Results: Gothams won with 5 wickets\n\nStaten Island: 189/5\n\nPhiladelphia: 188/0\n\nNewcomer Sammy Woods would be awarded the second-ever MVP honors in league history.\n\nA month after the finals. The USCA and CCA would stage their first One-Day International in front of a sold-out crowd at Washington Field in Brooklyn, New York. After some questions a month before to how many games would be played between the two teams. It was decided that it would be a best-of-three series. So between October 21st to 23rd of 1892, the first-ever series in the CAN-AM Cup, formally called The Boarder Wars, was held by both nations.\n\nCanadian Cricket Association XI Roster:\n\nMichael George Bristow (Captain)\n\nJF Mackie\n\nPercy Clarke Goldingham\n\nJohn S Bowbanks\n\nJE Hall\n\nHarry Ackland\n\nBenjamin Bell\n\nLouis Coste\n\nAlbert H Collins\n\nFrancis William Terry\n\nQH Warden (Wicket-Keeper)\n\nStaten Island Gothams Roster:\n\nJW Dutton (Captain)\n\nSammy Woods\n\nLouis Griffen\n\nHenry Tyers\n\nW Mattock\n\nLN Cahill\n\nW Massey\n\nMJ West (First Test Match)*\n\nHE Jackson\n\nTC Jordan\n\nJ Palmer (Wicket-Keeper)\n\nMatch One and Two would be shared by both test nations. Despite losing game one to Staten Island, the CCA XI would rebound back to win Match Two convincingly. The Third and Final ODI saw a record crowd over in Washington Field as due to some poor fielding and bowling from the Canadians, Gothams would capture the victory. Despite the loss, the CCA XI showed great sportsmanship in defeat.\n\nMatch One Results: Gothams won by 135 runs\n\nCCA XI: 114/0\n\nStaten Island: 249/7\n\nMatch Two Results: CCA XI won by 3 wickets\n\nCCA XI: 115/7\n\nStaten Island: 113/0\n\nFinal Match Results: Gothams won by 36 runs\n\nCCA XI: 226/0\n\nStaten Island 262/7\n\nThe first CAN-AM Cup ended with a victory for the United States Cricket Association. A rumor that the league would expand to eight teams by 1895. While rumors of expansion were nothing new by this time. The Cup win over Canada would help cement the plans in motion for expansion.\n\nWith the cricket season starting up. Something was becoming clearer to American Cricketers. While during practice for the upcoming season. More and more Black Americans would come and watch. Baseball was segregated by a gentlemen's agreement with the owners. That hasn’t stopped most blacks from playing and forming leagues like the Southern League of Colored Base Ballists in the southern United States and the National Colored League. Both leagues predated Rube Foster’s Negro National League by at least decades.\n\nWhile Cricket never had this agreement. It was still seen by most Americans as taboo at the time. Despite this, the NCL would never have the gentlemen’s agreement like in Baseball to segregate. Instead, they would help teach Black Americans how to play the game of Cricket so they could form their own negro cricket league. The first league wouldn’t start till 1898 but the idea of starting it grew.\n\nThe season saw the relocation of the Bronx Highlanders to Brooklyn after being bought by Charles Ebbets. Ebbets wasted no time moving the team from Randel Island Park to Washington Field and changing the team name to the Brooklyn Robins. Ebbets would also spend money to renovate Washington Field to accommodate both Baseball and Cricket.\n\nNational Cricket League Teams for 1893:\n\nStaten Island Gothams (Livingston Field)\n\nPhiladelphia Rovers (Germantown Cricket Club Ground)\n\nNew Haven Stars (Edgewood Park Cricket Grounds)\n\nManhattan Cricket Club (Randel Island Park)\n\nBrooklyn Robins (Washington Field)\n\nBoston Bluecaps (Boston City Grounds)\n\nThe first of three games of the 1893 National Cricket League season began in Staten Island, New York as the Boston Bluecaps traveled to Livingston Field to challenge the defending champions Gothams. The Bluecaps were looking to upset the Gothams at home. Despite the high hopes, Staten Island won the series with a clean sweep over Boston.\n\nMatch 1 Results: Staten Island won by 22 runs\n\nBoston Bluecaps: 187/8\n\nStaten Island Gothams: 209/7\n\nMatch 2 Results: Staten Island won by 5 runs\n\nBoston Bluecaps: 179/7\n\nStaten Island Gothams: 184/9\n\nThe second game saw Philadelphia taking on New Haven over at Edgewood Park. Both games were won by Philadelphia by a wide margin. The last of the three games played was Manhatten challenging the newly renamed Brooklyn Robins. Despite a rough first game by Brooklyn, the Robins would bounce back and win the second game.\n\nMatch 1 Results: Manhattan won by 23 runs\n\nManhattan: 194/5\n\nBrooklyn: 171/6\n\nMatch 2 Results: Brooklyn won by 68 runs\n\nManhattan: 142/0\n\nBrooklyn: 210/7\n\nNCL 1893 NCL Regular Season Final Standings:\n\nStaten Island Gothams 17-03-00\n\nManhatten C.C. 15-03-01\n\nPhiladelphia Rovers 13-04-02\n\nBrooklyn Robins 11-08-1\n\nNew Haven Stars 08-12-00\n\nBoston Bluecaps 04-16-00\n\nThe season saw Staten Island being the top club while Manhatten was close behind. Philadelphia would end up being dethroned from the top two and landed in third place behind Manhatten. Brooklyn wasn't far behind in the standing but finished fourth. New Haven and Boston would end the season in the last two places in the standings after a poor showing.\n\nThe NCL President’s Cup finals took place at Livingston Park in Staten Island. Manhattan was led by John Bart King while the Gothams were captained by Sammy Woods this season. During the regular season, the two teams were even in almost every way. Now the two teams are competing in the finals. With a large crowd of 6,500 spectators watching over the game. The Gothams would end up winning after some bad bowling from Manhatten. Sammy Woods would win the MVP honors for his strong leadership. JW Dutton, the former captain, would announce he was going to retire and become a leading figure in helping young Black Americans learn the game along with Sammy Woods.\n\n1893 NCL President’s Cup Finals: Staten Island won by 28 runs.\n\nPhiladelphia: 187/8\n\nStaten Island: 215/6\n\nThe fourth season was seen as a good change of pace for the league. Despite the Brooklyn Robins playing in a large venue. The league was still seen as a second thought compared to Baseball. However, things would look up as the league announced they would expand to 8 teams for the 1895 Season. The two teams would be announced after the 1894 Season.\n\n(This chapter took a bit longer to get this chapter released. Hope everyone enjoys it and any comments and questions are welcome.)\n\nThe 1894 cricket season for the United States started with the announcement that Lord Hawke would tour the States once again. Announcing five games for his returning tour. Three of which were against different amateur clubs across the eastern United States. The National Cricket League wasn’t left out, and the remaining two were ODI test matches against the best players from the six NCL clubs. During two of his tests across the East Coast, Lord Hawke’s team noticed that there was a notable number of Black Americans watching the game play out.\n\n“It was a surprise that a gentlemen's game of Cricket was starting to reach the different social classes in the United States. I was honestly glad to see it. With Baseball seen as the faster game, Cricket still has a chance to thrive through some rough times through this new grassroots movement.” Lord Hawke interview from the Cheltenham Chronicle newspaper\n\nLord Hawke’s XI Roster for the Test:\n\nLord Hawke (Captain)\n\nGerald Bardswell\n\nLawrence Bathurst\n\nCharles de Trafford\n\nLedger Hill\n\nGeorge Hillyard\n\nRobert Lucas\n\nKenneth McAlpine\n\nGerald Mordaunt\n\nSandford Robinson\n\nCharles Wright (wicket-keeper)\n\nNCL Cricket All-Star XI Roster for the Test:\n\nJohn Bart King(Captain)\n\nGreg Chambers\n\nMJ West\n\nSammy Wood\n\nCL Bixby\n\nJW Dutton\n\nLouis Griffen\n\nJacob Forbes\n\nCharles J Rhodes\n\nHyder Clarke\n\nEric Thomas (Wicket-Keeper)\n\nThe two ODI Test Matches took place in Brooklyn in front of a sell-out Washington Field. Close to 7,000 paid spectators watched as the National Cricket League XI took on Lord Hawke’s XI. The match was long, but rewarding for the NCL as they would end up winning both test matches with the crowd cheering on the NCL XI.\n\n“I was, at one time, feared that the American Cricketers would lose their excitement for the game and so would the spectators. Baseball is a faster game, quicker, and would give cricket a painful death by now. I’m very happy to say that I was proven wrong. The 50-overs game, while still a bit long, still managed to grab the attention of the American public. Hopefully, it will last.” Lord Hawke interview from the Cheltenham Chronicle newspaper\n\nMatch 1 Results: NCL All-Stars XI won by 6 wickets\n\nLord Hawke’s XI: 133/0\n\nNCL All-Stars XI: 135/4\n\nMatch 2 Results: NCL All-Stars XI won by 38 runs\n\nLord Hawke’s XI: 184/0\n\nNCL All-Stars XI: 222/6\n\nWhile the rest of their tour saw Lord Hawke’s team win the last three games. The NCL would look into its expansion plans for 1895. A few bids came from Baltimore, Maryland to the Midwest cities of Chicago and Detroit. In the end, the Baltimore bid was accepted as the first expansion club for the NCL. The team would become known as the Baltimore Royals. While the midwestern bids were welcomed, the league would announce the second team would be from Hoboken, New Jersey. They would be known just as the New Jersey Cricket Club for the 1985 season.\n\nDespite the Chicago and Detroit bids not ending up being accepted. The NCL would accidentally start the formation of a new cricket league for the Midwest. The American Association of Professional Cricket was formed on May 16th, 1884. Chicago would become one of the founding teams along with teams from Detroit, Kansas City, St. Louis, Columbus, and Indianapolis. They would play in converted baseball parks from the former American Association league that folded after their 1891 season.\n\nAmerican Association of Professional Cricket Teams for Inaugural Season:\n\nChicago Blues (West Side Grounds (The Original West Side Park))\n\nKansas City Cowboys (Exposition Park)(named after the Baseball AA team)\n\nSt. Louis Kings (Athletic Park)(Currently sharing with St. Louis Browns of Baseball National League)\n\nColumbus Solons (Recreation Park)(named after the Baseball AA team)\n\nDetroit Wolverines (Bennett Park)\n\nIndianapolis Hoosiers (Bruce Grounds)(named after the Baseball AA team)\n\nThe AAPC would be the first cricket league in the United States to challenge the NCL. To the American Association, they wanted to be the NCL for the Midwest. The NCL welcomed them but was seen as an “Outlaw League” by the MCC members in London. Despite this, the NCL and the AAPC were helping Cricket stay relevant with Baseball being popular with most Americans.\n\n(Before I begin, I am American so this is way out of my league despite following cricket as a sport for some time now. So with that said, I want to thank @Sarthak for helping me out by providing some background info for this series. I'm also setting this story from 1890 to 1899 as its first chapter. Hence why I'm here. Critiques are welcome and any advice would be welcome. I'm nervous but worth at least getting the first chapter out. Now on with the show.)\n\n(I am just throwing this out there, Some of the people are fictional while most are not and are named after real players from around that time. Same with the places the teams played on.)\n\n“We were so close. MCC wanted us to join yet Canada vetoed are way in. Their loss was our opportunity to grow” George Patterson (1920)\n\n“The 50-overs league that USCA established in 1890 was a brilliant move by them and helped submit that cricket can coexist with Baseball in America.” Bart King (1915)\n\n“Cricket is a fantastic game but needed to change to professionalism and adapt to what Baseball was doing. If not then the damage would be permanent.” Charles Wright* (1910)\n\nWhen the USA was rejected to join the MCC in 1886 thanks to the efforts of the Cape Colony, New South Wales, and mainly Canada. It was seen as a sad reminder at the time that they were outcasts. The United States was not an Imperial Colony to the United Kingdom yet it has enjoyed Cricket despite creating its own game called Baseball.\n\nIt was faster than traditional Five-Day Overs, games could be played in one day and fans left happy knowing they enjoyed the match. For years, players have been wanting a 50 or 60-over version of the game to complete in just one day. However, the MCC members rejected the idea. With the rejection of joining the MCC by those three nations. The USA was left with no choice. It was time for Cricket to go Professional and be shortened to 50 overs.\n\nThe formation of a professional cricket league was kept secret from the rest of the cricket-playing world. George Patterson, considered one of the best cricketers of his time, would help spearhead the idea. However, it took a millionaire, Charles Wright, to round up a group of investors to spend money on a new, professional cricket league. The new league would be considered a test by the ones who invested in the league and by the cricketers who partake in this new competition.\n\n“They decision to create the National Cricket League to help promote a shorter form of cricket while reeducating the American people that cricket is an enjoyable spectator sport.” JB Thayer Sr. (1912)\n\nNational Cricket League Original Teams:\n\nStaten Island Gothams (Walker Park)\n\nPhiladelphia Rovers (Germantown Cricket Club Ground)\n\nNew Haven Olympic (Edgewood Park Cricket Grounds)\n\nManhattan Cricket Club (Randel Island Park)\n\nBronx Highlanders (Randle Island Park)\n\nBoston Bluecaps (Boston City Grounds)\n\nThe Season, which first lasted between late June to mid-July would see at least a total of 20-day games. Ten home and ten away games for each team. In the end, only the top two teams competed for the NCL President Cup.\n\nThe six clubs were mostly to demonstrate the game to the northeastern United States. While Baseball has a firm grasp on most of the United States. Cricket still has a foothold in the northeast. A grassroots effort that is about to pay off. Before the season could begin, the teams gathered their best players and told them they were going professional. Despite some rejection from some players. New players saw this as an opportunity to play cricket and make an alright to good living.\n\nA week before the season could begin, the NCL held its first exhibition in front of a paying crowd of 5,000 spectators at the Manhattan Cricket Club grounds, Randel Island Park. The two teams were made of the best players of the six teams in the new league. The fine Saturday midday game which lasted around till evening saw some good action despite the fans being more or less new to the 50-overs rules. The officials handed out pamphlets describing the new version of cricket to the attendants who arrived.\n\nGame Results: NCL Team A XI defeated NCL Team B XI by 2 Wickets.\n\nNCL Team A XI Roster:\n\nDavid E Walker\n\nHyder Clarke\n\nMark Cameron\n\nFranklin Brown Sr.\n\nJoe Baily\n\nPeter J Patterson\n\nJW Dutton\n\nLester Heys\n\nGreg Chambers\n\nJohn Bart King\n\nJon Martin\n\nNCL Team B XI Roster:\n\nWJ Kennedy\n\nEric Wood\n\nDevin Little\n\nPW Clark\n\nLouis Griffen\n\nEddie Muir\n\nReese T. McColn\n\nTJ Franklin\n\nJohn Kelly\n\nDavid Kelly\n\nJacob Forbes\n\nDespite some nonbelievers to this new form of cricket, the exhibition game was a resounding success. The season would take place one week later on June 23rd, 1890 in front of a crowd of 5,000 cricket fans in Roandel Island Park to see the Boston Bluecaps, led by captain Louis Griffen challenge Manhattan C.C. led by exhibition MVP John Bart King. Boston would lose the first game by 6 wickets against Manhattan. Boston would come back the next day and revenge their loss by 8 wickets.\n\nMatch 1 & 2 Results:\n\nManhattan C.C. 180/4 - 170/0\n\nBoston Bluecaps: 181/0 - 174/2\n\nThe other game was between the Philadelphia Rovers and Statan Island Gothams at a well-packed crowd in Walker Park. The Rovers were led by Franklin Brown Sr. who was a member of the Germantown Cricket Club but left to join the Rovers. The Gothams were led by JW Dutton who wasn’t a member of the Staten Island Cricket Clubs before but would sign on to play for the Gothams before the season began. Both games in the series were won by the Rovers, Match One by 6 wickets and the second by 4 wickets.\n\nMatch 1 & 2 Results:\n\nPhiladelphia Rovers 174/2 - 166/6\n\nStaten Island Gothams 170/0 - 165/9\n\nNCL National Cricket League 1890 Final Standing:\n\nManhattan C.C. 16-04-00\n\nPhiladelphia Rovers 14-04-02\n\nStaten Island Gotham 10-06-04\n\nNew Haven Olympic 09-11-00\n\nBoston Bluecaps 06-10-02\n\nBronx Highlanders 04-16-00\n\nThe two teams were set. Manhattan and Philadelphia were the best teams in the league despite the two ties from the Rovers against the Bluecaps and Gothams respectively. The finals were played in the Germantown Cricket Club Grounds in Philadelphia on August 11, 1890. A crowd of loyal cricket fans and newcomers came and left home happy as the outcome of this one-game playoff series saw the Rovers defeat Manhattan by 80 runs. The Rovers were crowned the first NCL Presidents Cup Champions.\n\nPresident Cup Finals Results:\n\nManhattan C.C. 88/7\n\nPhiladelphia Rovers 168/7\n\nThe first season was a surprising and welcome success for the USCA. Fan outcomes were manageable and the finals saw new fans cheering for both the Rovers and Manhattan. Even younger fans saw the game since the NCL allowed children to watch games for free. Despite the success, Baseball was still beating Cricket the fact that Manhattan, Bronx, and Philadelphia had decent-sized grounds. Teams like Boston and New Haven have been playing in parks that were modified to create cricket grounds inside the parks.\n\nAnother issue was, the MCC. The secret wouldn’t last and the MCC, led by Canada and New South Wales, would issue a ban on playing with American Cricketers and Teams until the new league was abolished. Despite this, England, Ireland, and Scotland would ignore this. The MCC was divided and would take years before things would be settled. Till then, England clubs would tour America playing the 50-overs test matches against both the teams in the NCL and an American XI team made up of NCL best players over the coming year.\n\nLove this, following\n\nThe introduction of a faster, professionalized form of cricket in the US might have consequences in Italy; most early football clubs were also cricket clubs after all, so cricket might survive.\n\nHonestly didn't know that so that's neat. thanks for telling me that, I might do some USA vs. Italy cricket matches in the future.\n\nLove this, following\n\nThank you!\n\nI’m very interested to see any cricket related timelines, but I have to be the chap that asks the central questions:\n\n- How and why is the jump to 50 over Cricket being made in the 1890s?\n\n- Not only is the basis for ODIs absent in that period, but the scoring rates are suspiciously modern. Why?\n\nShort over cricket developed in the 1960s (I’m aware of the outlier experiment in India in the 50s) when longer form cricket was encountering some issues with crowds, but also when there were certain means of broadcasting, such as radio and television.\n\n50 overs was a later development for good reasons. The initial one day games of 60-65 overs, whilst they seem uneven from our modern perspective, work out at a fairly straightforward over rate of 15/hour.\n\nThe perceived issue for American sporting audiences is that still translates to a fairly long day, particularly when broken by a necessary lunch break. 50 overs doesn’t knock that down much, by the by.\n\nMy gut feeling is that there are means to working a higher profile and longevity for American cricket, but I don’t think that simply slapping the exigencies of 1960s England in place in the 1890s are those means.\n\n50 overs cricket was an idea that had been floated as far back as 1850, though at the time of course the length of an over was different. The idea was more popular at the time in the west indies, Canada, Argentina and the New English Cricket Clubs in America.\n\nI’ve never come across that before. I would be interested to read up on it and examine the source material as there is a difference between an idea that is floated and one that is executed, then becomes instantly successful and takes on the characteristics of modern limited overs cricket.\n\nCricket in 1850 had yet to develop into the ‘modern’ form that it would assume in the 1870s-1890s, or the first part of the ‘Golden Age’. Drawing conclusions from the antediluvian period may be drawing too long a bow, as it were.\n\nShould this be viable, and I have to say I don’t see it at the moment, then it effectively kills off Test cricket and first class cricket, with all that entails.\n\nI honestly ask for help before doing the current version of this story. @Sarthak helped me by pointing out that 50-overs were being discussed as far back as the mid-1800s. My original pitch before scraping it was a shorter form of cricket based on T10. Which while faster, wasn't very accurate for the time. Test Cricket and First Class won't be going anywhere due to the Ashes. They mostly take a back seat for 50-overs and eventually T20 whenever it gets introduced to TTL.\n\nHopefully, that helps explain some stuff. I do try and research as much as I can for this series. As long as people enjoy it then I'm very happy with the series and will continue working on it.\n\nI honestly ask for help before doing the current version of this story. @Sarthak helped me by pointing out that 50-overs were being discussed as far back as the mid-1800s.

As long as people enjoy it then I'm very happy with the series and will continue working on it.\n\nAs said, there is 'discussed' and 'discussed seriously by important stakeholders', and further levels beyond.\n\nAs one who finds modern mutations of cricket something of a perversion of the form, I must say I'm glad that the mentioned iteration never saw the light of day. However, you are sadly wrong with the conclusion that Test and First Class cricket aren't going anywhere. You've inserted a much more exciting and marketable game right in the infancy of Test cricket, which will act to draw off attention, interest and attraction from it until it dies like a consumptive Edwardian orphan, abandoned in the figurative gutter. The Ashes won't factor into it, being a relatively new contest without any of the cachet or repute it would gain over decades.\n\nSimilarly, first class cricket won't have a place if it doesn't have a flow on to international level. It might putter along for a bit, but then it will die out all the same, starved by the New Prometheus from across t'Atlantic.\n\nIf you are already contemplating the introduction of T20 in the 1890s, then there goes the sport. The race to the fastest and flashiest will be a lot quicker if kickstarted in this fashion."
