        "text": "Ms Elphicke has defected hitting out at the “broken promises of Rishi Sunak’s tired and chaotic Government”.\n\nThe Dover MP astonishingly crossed the floor in the Commons just moments before Prime Minister’s Questions.\n\nShe said in a statement: “I have carefully considered this decision. The change has been dramatic and cannot be ignored.\n\n“For me key deciding factors have been housing and the safety and security of our borders.”\n\nThe move has been hit at from all sides, with MPs slamming Sir Keir Starmer for welcoming the right wing politician with open arms and Tory members branding the decision “idiotic”.\n\nDespite ferocious criticism, Labour has defended Ms Elphicke and said it is “happy” to have the Tory MP on board.\n\nIn a new humiliating blow for Rishi, Ms Elphickle joins Dr Dan Poulter and Christian Wakeford in joining the opposition.\n\nThe walk-out was took place during the first face off since last week’s local election results, where Sir Keir Starmer hit out at the Conservatives for losing nearly 500 council seats in last week’s elections.\n\nKey Points\n\nSunak and Starmer clash in first PMQs since Tory local election\n\nNatalie Elphicke crosses floor in dramatic defection to Labour before PMQs\n\nLabour defends welcoming Natalie Elphicke to party\n\nSuspended Labour MP gets whip back\n\nSenior Russian diplomat expelled from UK over spying\n\nTuesday 7 May 2024 16:10 , Maryam Zakir-Hussain\n\nLive: Grant Shapps updates MPs after Ministry of Defence data breach\n\nBritain ‘implores’ Israel to reopen border crossings into Gaza\n\nTuesday 7 May 2024 16:14 , Maryam Zakir-Hussain\n\nBritain is “imploring” Israel to reopen border crossings into Gaza, including Rafah, to ensure humanitarian aid can get though, a foreign minister has told Parliament.\n\nLord Ahmad of Wimbledon also echoed concerns over the threat of a military offensive on the southern city, where around half the population are children.\n\nThe Tory frontbencher said: “We are imploring Israel to ensure that the crossings that were shut are opened immediately, including in Rafah.”\n\nHe revealed the Foreign Secretary Lord Cameron had spoken to the president of Israel on Monday morning.\n\nLord Ahmad said: “We do believe this is an escalation which needs to be immediately resolved. Because there are now 600,000 children in Rafah, almost 50% of Rafah is children. We need to ensure their safety and security and at the moment we have not been reassured at all in terms of any detail of plans as to where these people would move.”\n\nHe added the suggested place of evacuation was “pretty barren land”.\n\nHolyrood votes for SNP leader John Swinney to be Scotland’s next first minister\n\nTuesday 7 May 2024 16:19 , Andy Gregory\n\nMembers of the Scottish Parliament have voted for new SNP leader John Swinney to be Scotland's next first minister, succeeding Humza Yousaf who formally resigned from the post earlier on Tuesday.\n\nMr Swinney won the backing of 64 MSPs, with his nearest rival Scottish Conservatives leader Douglas Ross picking up 31.\n\nIt comes just eight days after predecessor Humza Yousaf announced he was stepping down, after his decision to terminate the powersharing agreement the SNP had with the Scottish Greens at Holyrood left him facing a vote of no confidence in his leadership.\n\nTuesday 7 May 2024 16:41 , Maryam Zakir-Hussain\n\nThe Government has been pressed over the use of British troops to distribute aid in Gaza once a maritime supply route had been established.\n\nTory former Cabinet minister Lord Clarke of Nottingham said: “We are very near to the prospect of aid being delivered by sea once the Americans have finished the construction of a quay that they are undertaking.\n\n“Has the Government made any progress in reassuring us about the orderly distribution and safe distribution of aid by that route when the quay is ready?\n\n“And what is the Government’s present position on direct British involvement including the use of British troops if necessary to try to work to get proper distribution of that aid to the people we hope will be able to receive it?\n\nResponding, foreign minister Lord Ahmad said: “On the issue of safe distribution within Gaza that is a key component of this.”\n\nHe stressed the need to ensure the safety of aid workers who had “the expertise”.\n\nLord Ahmad added: “We are looking at all of the dynamics on the best way to support a British operation in support of this international effort.”\n\nShapps apologises to armed forces personnel\n\nTuesday 7 May 2024 17:06 , Joe Middleton\n\nDefence secretary Grant Shapps apologised to the armed forces personnel affected by the Ministry of Defence cyberattack.\n\nSpeaking in the Commons on Tuesday afternoon, he said: “I want to apologise for the men and women affected – it should not happen.”\n\nHe added that the plan to fix the system means it will not happen again.\n\nCyberattack was work of ‘malign actor,’ Shapps says\n\nTuesday 7 May 2024 17:09 , Maryam Zakir-Hussain\n\nGrant Shapps said the hacking of the Ministry of Defence “was the suspected work of a malign actor” but added “we cannot rule out state involvement”.\n\nThe defence secretary said the cyberattack shows the UK is facing “rising and evolving threats” adding: “The world is becoming somewhat more dangerous.”\n\nUp to 272,000 personnel affected by cyberattack\n\nTuesday 7 May 2024 17:33 , Maryam Zakir-Hussain\n\nUp to 272,000 service personnel may have been hit by the data breach, Grant Shapps told MPs.\n\nHe set out an eight-point plan to support and protect those potentially affected.\n\nThe Cabinet minister declined to identify the culprit, telling the Commons: “For reasons of national security, we can’t release further details of the suspected cyber activity behind this incident.\n\n“However, I can confirm to the House that we do have indications that this was the suspected work of a malign actor and we cannot rule out state involvement.”\n\nHe also said: “We’ve launched a full investigation, drawing on Cabinet Office support and specialist external expertise to examine the potential failings of the contractor and to minimise the risk of similar incidents in the future.”\n\nInitial investigations have found no evidence that any data has been removed, but affected armed forces personnel have been alerted as a precaution.\n\nJohn Healey flags ‘serious concern’ cyberattack was reported in media before Parliament was updated\n\nTuesday 7 May 2024 18:03 , Maryam Zakir-Hussain\n\nShadow defence secretary John Healey has said there will be “serious concern” that news of a cyberattack was reported in the media before Defence Secretary Grant Shapps was able to update Parliament.\n\nHe told MPs: “My overriding concern is for the safety of serving personnel and veterans affected. Worried about the risk to them and their families, hearing first about the data being hacked from the media and not from the MoD (Ministry of Defence).”\n\nHe added: “On the contractor, Defence Business Services say Shared Services Connected Limited (SSCL) has the MoD contract for core payroll and other business services. How many contracts does SSCL or its parent company Sopra Steria have with the MoD? What action has been taken by other government departments with similar SSCL contracts?”\n\nMr Healey further stated: “The media have clearly been briefed that China is behind the hack but the Defence Secretary only tells us about a malign actor.

youngest ever Member of the Scottish Parliament (MSP) to be elected, says Holyrood has become “much more toxic” in recent years, as he complained that homophobic abuse has become “considerably worse”.\n\nMr Greer, the Scottish Greens member who was 21 years old when he first became an MSP, told how he had been “patronised” by those outside of Holyrood because of his age and had also suffered from “much more serious homophobic abuse”.\n\nHe spoke out on the issue to the PA news agency in the wake of the 25th anniversary of MSPs first being elected in 1999.\n\nThe Greens, which will celebrate his 30th birthday next month, said: “The ageism stuff I find very silly.\n\n“I get much more serious homophobic abuse, and that has got considerably worse in the last couple of years.\n\n“Scottish politics and Scottish society in general is a worse place for LGBT people than it was five years ago.”\n\nMr Greer said: “Certainly the parliament as an institution has become a much more toxic and adversarial place, it is mimicking a lot of the behaviours of Westminster that it was designed specifically to reject and to be an alternative to.”\n\nHis comments came as he hit

Court of Session in Edinburgh will involve the Perthshire North MSP making his statutory declarations, after which he will be granted his official title of first minister and keeper of the Scottish Seal.\n\nHe pledged to devote himself to the job after winning a Holyrood vote meaning he will become the seventh person to be first minister since the Scottish Parliament was established 25 years ago, following an unopposed selection process a week after predecessor Humza Yousaf resigned.\n\nMr Swinney said it was an “extraordinary privilege” to become Scotland’s new first minister as he pledged to “give everything I have” to the role.\n\nHe shook hands with opposition leaders in the chamber at the Scottish Parliament after the vote.\n\nMr Swinney told the other parties at Holyrood: “If we want to fund our schools and hospitals, if we want to give our businesses a competitive edge, if we want to take climate action, if we want to eradicate child poverty, if we want to change people’s lives for the better, we have got to work together to do so.”\n\nBut he said he would “give all of my energy and my willingness” to achieve this, committing to be “the first minister for everyone in Scotland”.\n\nJim Wallace says Halyrood needs ‘significantly more’ MSPs\n\n06:00 , Shweta Sharma\n\nFormer Scottish deputy first minister Jim Wallace has said the number of MSPs at Holyrood “needs to be looked at again”.\n\nThe former Scottish Liberal Democrat leader played a key role in determining the number of MSPs who would sit in the Scottish Parliament when it was established back in 1999, being involved in negotiations with Labour’s George Robertson on the matter.\n\nBut with Holyrood now having increased responsibilities - including powers over income tax in Scotland and social security - Lord Wallace, who was Scotland’s first deputy first minister, now believes “significantly more” MSPs are needed.\n\nThe Liberal Democrat, who served as an MP before joining the Scottish Parliament when it was established, told how during his time at Westminster he had been involved in discussions about how the new parliament would operate.\n\n“I think now the Parliament requires significantly more, it has more responsibilities, not least for tax and social security.\n\n“I think 129 needs to be looked at again.”\n\nHe said Labour had acted “unilaterally” to hold a referendum on whether the devolved parliament should be established - with Liberal Democrats at the time opposed to such a ballot.\n\nHowever, Lord Wallace said: “In retrospect, it was probably the right thing to do. Because I think it gave the Parliament a political grounding which once done you can never roll back.”\n\nTop EU politician who survived Iran assassination plot delivers ‘end appeasement’ plea to Cameron\n\n06:30 , Maryam Zakir-Hussain\n\nA senior EU politician who survived a shocking assassination attempt last year has asked parliamentarians to tell foreign secretary Lord Cameron to end Britain’s “appeasement of Iran”.\n\nSpanish politician Alejo Vidal-Quadras, the former first vice president of the European Parliament, was in London today to talk to MPs and peers about the need to proscribe Iran’s Revolutionary Guard (IRGC).\n\nBut attempts for him to meet a minister fell on deaf ears.\n\nRead more here:\n\nIran assassination plot survivor delivers ‘end appeasement’ plea to Cameron\n\nPotential Tory contender steps up pressure on Sunak to curb ‘disastrous’ immigration\n\n07:00 , Shweta Sharma\n\nThe former immigration minister Robert Jenrick has called on the government to “undo the disastrous post-Brexit liberalisations” that “betrayed” the public’s wish for lower immigration before the general election.\n\nHe had put forward more than 30 recommendations to curb migration in a Centre for Policy Studies (CPS) report he co-authored.\n\nThe proposals include capping health and care visas at 30,000, scrapping the graduate route for international students, and indexing salary thresholds for visa routes in line with inflation.\n\nIt argues that net migration needs to be wound back to “the tens of thousands”.\n\nMr Jenrick, who is seen as a potential Tory leadership contender, argue that large-scale migration has failed to deliver significant fiscal benefits while putting pressure on housing, public services and infrastructure.\n\nMr Jenrick said: “It would be unforgivable if the Government did not use the time before the general election to undo the disastrous post-Brexit liberalisations that betrayed the express wishes of the British public for lower immigration.\n\n“The changes we propose today would finally return numbers to the historical norm and deliver the highly-selective, highly-skilled immigration system voters were promised. These policies could be implemented immediately and would consign low-skilled mass migration to the past.\n\n“Immigration is consistently one of the top concerns of voters and they deserve a department whose sole mission is controlling immigration and securing our borders.

They want us to be cognisant of the fact that they’ve had a difficult time when it comes to public finances, which is why we’re putting forward £900 of tax cuts.\n\n“They want us to make sure that we’re protecting their security, which we are when it comes to defence, when it comes to energy as well.\n\n“I would just have contrast with some of Labour’s positions, when it comes to their mad energy plans which will hike up people’s bills and heap costs on people, with the 75 new business regulations which will deter investment at a time when we need investment coming into this country and on things like immigration where they don’t have a plan at all.”\n\nGove invokes Kate Moss as he warns Tories against ‘comfort eating’ on hard-line policies\n\n08:41 , Matt Mathers\n\nMichael Gove told his colleagues “nothing tastes as good as skinny feels” as he invoked supermodel Kate Moss to warn against “comfort eating” on hard-line policies.\n\nThe secretary of state for housing and communities comments came during Tuesday’s cabinet meeting - the first since the Tories lost nearly 500 councillors in last week’s local elections drubbing.\n\nHe urged cabinet ministers not to pursue policies that “make us feel good,” The Times reported.

I hope his new ones do him as proud as I am of all of mine.\n\n“Great leaders like Andy Street who leave behind a strong legacy of more homes, more jobs, and more investment, in sharp contrast to the legacy left by the last Labour government, which was a letter joking that there was no money left.”\n\nPMQs analysis: Rishi Sunak is out of attack lines\n\n12:27 , Salma Ouaguira\n\nRishi Sunak always has a smile on his face in PMQs but he has been forced to reach for old well worn attack lines to respond to Keir Starmer, David Maddox reports.\n\nThe claims that the Tories is “the only party of the motorists” and attacks on Labour London mayor Sadiq Khan all fell flat last week.\n\nIn reality he will struggle to explain the exodus of Tory MPs crossing the floor to Labour or the exit door with dozens announcing they will stand down at the next election.\n\nRishi calls Starmer a ‘virtue-signalling lawyer from north London'\n\n12:31 , Salma Ouaguira\n\nStarmer said the PM now had Labour representation at all of “the many places he calls home” after last week’s local elections.\n\nSir Keir said in PMQs: “The public keep telling (Mr Sunak), the voters tell him it’s not good enough, instead of listening he keeps telling them everything’s fine, if only they realise his greatness. He just doesn’t get it.\n\n“But at least after Thursday night he can go to the many places that he calls home and enjoy the fruits of his success. In Southampton or Downing Street, he’s got great Labour councils. At his mansion in Richmond he can enjoy a brand new Labour mayor of North Yorkshire. At his pad in Kensington he can celebrate a historic third term for the Mayor of London.\n\n“Now that he too could enjoy the benefits of this changed Labour Party, is he really still in such a hurry to get back to California?”\n\nTo which Mr Sunak replied: “I was, of course, surprised to see (Sir Keir) in North Yorkshire but probably not as surprised as he was when he realised he couldn’t take the Tube there.\n\n“I can tell him that the people of North Yorkshire believe in hard work, secure borders, lower taxes and straight-talking common sense, they’re not going to get any of that from a virtue-signalling lawyer from north London.”\n\nTory right feels betrayed\n\n12:34 , Salma Ouaguira\n\nRightwing Tories made it clear they feel betrayed by Natalie Elphicke who was seen as one of their wing of the party.\n\nDame Andrea Jenkyns, a Boris Johnson supporter, Tweeted: “@NatalieElphicke you were a centre right Conservative, Labour want to give asylum to 50,000 plus people. I thought you had more conviction than to join the lefty labour lot you despised so much!”\n\nElphicke told voters not to trust Labour on immigration just a year ago\n\n12:35 , Matt Mathers\n\nNew Labour MP Natalie Elphicke wrote that Labour could not be trusted on immigration a little over a year ago.\n\nWriting for the Daily Express, Elphicke said that the government’s ‘stop the boats’ bill was the only way to tackle illegal immigration.\n\nShe also accused the opposition of trying to “undermine” the government’s flagship immigration policy.\n\n“The boats undermine our national security – because we have no ability to control who is arriving or prevent people who pose a threat to public safety,” she wrote.\n\n“That’s why the government’s Stop the Boats Bill is so vital, and why Labour’s attempts to undermine it are so dangerous.”\n\nIn full: Sir Keir Starmer challenges Rishi Sunak to call a general election\n\n12:36 , Salma Ouaguira\n\nThe Labour leader said removing 1% of asylum seekers isn’t stopping the boats but granting a Tory amnesty.\n\nHe added: “But if he thinks the voters are wrong, if he thinks his own MPs joining the Labour Party are wrong, if he thinks anyone believes any of the nonsense that he spouts, why doesn’t he put it to the test and call a general election?”\n\nMr Sunak replied: “He talks about removing people. This is a person who campaigned … to stop the deportation of foreign national offenders. It shows how out of touch his values are with the British people.\n\n“It is yet another week where we hear nothing about his plan to do anything on the issues that matter to the country.”\n\nAfter listing the Government’s steps to tackle problems in the NHS and migration, he added: “He snipes from the sidelines, the Conservatives are building a brighter future.”\n\nMore posts on X from Natlie Elphicke are being shared by Tory MPs\n\n12:38 , Matt Mathers\n\nBack in 2022 she warned of a \"coalition of chaos\" with Labour and the SNP, David Maddox reports.\n\nShe Tweeted: \"At #PMQs today a very muddled and confused performance by Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer.\n\n“A strong reminder that all the opposition offer is a Lib/Lab/SNP coalition of chaos that would take our country backwards on Brexit and break up the United Kingdom.\"\n\n‘Dodgy salesman'\n\n12:39 , Matt Mathers\n\nIn PMQs, Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer said Rishi Sunak is a “dodgy salesman” as he pushed the prime minister on small boat crossings while Mr Sunak challenged Sir Keir to respond to comments made by newly re-elected London Mayor Sadiq Khan.\n\nSir Keir told the Commons: “(He) has finally found something in common with the British public – no matter where he calls home all his neighbours are backing this changed Labour Party and they keep rejecting him because they have sussed him out.\n\n“They know there’s nothing behind the boasts, the gimmicks, the smug smile. He’s a dodgy salesman, desperate to sell them a dud. 16 days ago, when he held a press conference claiming victory on Rwanda, he said the next few weeks will be about action. People want deeds, not words. So, let’s test that. How many small boat crossings have there been since he said that 16 days ago?”\n\nSunak said: “Just before we go into that, he talked about a changed Labour Party, he talks about it a lot, and he also talked about his new mayor in London.\n\n“So, just this morning, we’ve learned that the Labour mayor in London believes – and I quote – that there is an equivalence between the brutal terrorist attack of Hamas and Israel defending itself. And, let me be crystal clear, there is absolutely no equivalence between a terrorist group and a democratic state.\n\n“So can I ask (Sir Keir) now, will he take this opportunity to demonstrate that the Labour Party has changed, and will he condemn those comments from the Labour mayor?”\n\nIn full: SNP leader calls on UK to halt arms exports to Israel\n\n12:52 , Matt Mathers\n\nSNP leader in Westminster Stephen Flynn has called on the government to halt arms exports to Israel.\n\nHe said in PMQs: “As we await the imminent Israeli incursion into Rafah, where 1.2 million people are sheltering, including 600,000 children, it has been reported that the United States has paused an arms shipment to Israel. The UK will now follow suit, won’t it?\n\nSunak responded: “The UK government doesn’t, itself, directly provide or ship arms to Israel.\n\n“When it comes to the situation in Rafah, I’ve been very clear that we are deeply concerned about a full military incursion in Rafah, given the devastating humanitarian impact. I’ve made that position and point specifically to prime minister Netanyahu whenever we’ve spoken and will continue to urge all sides to focus on the negotiations at hand to bring about a pause in the conflict to release hostages and get more aid in.”\n\nMr Flynn said: “We all know that UK arms and tech is supporting Israel’s activities in Gaza and will be used in any attack on Rafah. Knowing that, and the devastation that is going to occur, surely the time has come to end our complicity and end our arms sales to Israel?”\n\nMr Sunak responded: “We periodically review advice on Israel’s commitment to international humanitarian law and ministers always act in accordance with that advice. Our position with regard to export licences following the most recent assessment is unchanged.\n\nTory MP claims BBC and Channel 4 ‘masquerade’ as impartial\n\n12:54 , Matt Mathers\n\nConservative MP Sir Philip Davies (Shipley) has accused the BBC and Channel 4 of “masquerading” as impartial.\n\nHe told the Commons: “Is the prime minister as appalled as I am at reports of militant civil servant, trade union, political activists, seeking to find ways not to implement the Rwanda deportations?\n\n“Does he agree with me that if they are not prepared to implement the will of the government – an act of parliament that was passed by both Houses of Parliament – that they should conclude that perhaps being in the civil service is perhaps not for them?\n\n“And maybe they can look for alternative employment at other left-wing organisations that masquerade as being impartial? Maybe they could try the BBC or Channel 4 news?”\n\nSunak replied: “My expectation is that civil servants will continue to be committed to supporting our priority of stopping the boats, and deliver in accordance with the civil service code.”\n\nHe added: “We are the only party that has a plan to stop the boats and we will face down all the obstacles in our way to deliver on this crucial priority for the British people.”\n\nWatch: Starmer welcomes Natalie Elphicke after Labour MP deflects from Conservatives\n\n13:00 , Matt Mathers\n\nElphicke won’t stand down until the general election\n\n13:04 , Matt Mathers\n\nNatalie Elphicke will not stand down as a Tory MP until the general election.\n\nLabour has said it plans to stand its current candidate Mike Tapp, the FT’s Jim Pickard reports.\n\nElphicke defected to Labour just before PMQs.\n\nWatch: Women terminating pregnancies because they cannot afford to feed children, MP claims\n\n13:14 , Matt Mathers\n\nWomen terminating pregnancies because they cannot afford to feed children, MP claims\n\nJames Cleverly announces new sanctions against Russia\n\n13:16 , Salma Ouaguira\n\nThe Foreign Secretary has unveiled new measures against Russia after five people were charged under the provisions of the National Security Act.\n\nThe men were accused of plotting an arson attack at a commercial property in London.\n\nHe said that the incident was part of “a pattern of suspected Russian activity across Europe”.\n\nCleverly said: “Since the invasions the actions and threats from Russia have only increase.

It is right that, as we understand, she has received a formal written warning from the Labour Party.\n\n“The onus is now on her to engage with her local Jewish community in Enfield and the wider community, properly.
