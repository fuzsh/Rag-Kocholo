        "text": "There are significantly fewer guests at Westminster Abbey for the coronation of King Charles III and Queen Camilla today compared to that of Queen Elizabeth II.\n\nHowever, plenty of recognisable faces did get an invitation, from Ant and Dec to Lionel Richie, who is performing at the Coronation Concert tomorrow.\n\nPoliticians are well represented, too, and one of them – Penny Mordaunt – is actually playing a significant role in proceedings when King Charles is crowned.\n\nWhat does Penny Mordaunt do in the coronation?\n\nMs Mordaunt, the Tory MP who is the Leader of the House of Commons, is taking part in the coronation in her capacity as Lord President of the Privy Council, a role she has occupied since September 2022.\n\nShe also played a prominent part of the proceedings when King Charles was formally proclaimed monarch in front of the Accession Council on 10 September last year.\n\nMs Mordaunt carried the 17th-century Sword of State into the Abbey as part of the King’s procession to start the service.\n\nIts silver-gilt hilt features the form of a lion and unicorn, and the wooden scabbard is covered in red velvet with silver-gilt rose, thistle and fleur-de-lis emblems – the sword is also used during the State Opening of Parliament.\n\nThe MP’s next big moment comes during the presentation of the regalia to the king during the investiture and crowning ceremony.\n\nThe Jewelled Sword of Offering will be blessed by the Archbishop of Canterbury and presented to to the King by Ms Mordaunt – the first time the sword has been carried and presented by a woman.\n\nAn intricately tapered sword, made for George IV’s 1821 coronation, it symbolises royal power and the monarch accepting his duty and knightly virtues.\n\nAfter the King offers the sword to the Dean of Windsor, it is placed on the altar.\n\nIt is then “redeemed” by Ms Mordaunt, who places the redemption money on an almsdish, held by the Dean.\n\nShe will then draw the sword and carries it in its naked form – without its scabbard – before the monarch for the rest of the service.\n\nShe told The Times Red Box podcast: “I’m doing a number of things. One of them will be carrying the sword of state, which is the heaviest sword, so I’ve been doing some press-ups to train for that.\n\n“That represents his authority. It was one of two sword made for Charles II and only one survives.\n\n“It has to be carried at right angles to the body, hence the need to do press-ups – pointing upwards, out in front of you, for some time. We practiced with some replicas that were weighted, and it’s a huge honour to do it.”\n\nShe added that her background in the Navy had given her practice “standing for long periods of time, not fainting”.\n\nWhat is the Privy Council?\n\nThe Privy Council dates back to the 13th Century, when it was an executive arm of the English Government.\n\nHowever, its powers declined over time and its political authority transferred to the Cabinet in the late 17th Century.\n\nIt remains an advisory body to the monarch, with the Privy Counsellors required to take special oaths.\n\nCounsellors are appointed by the monarch on the advice of those who have held senior political or judicial roles in the UK or Commonwealth.\n\nThere are 739 Privy Counsellors, including lifetime peers and senior politicians, civil servants, Commonwealth high commissioners, and the Lord Mayor of London.\n\nIn normal circumstances these members advise the monarch on matters of state.\n\nThe Privy Council Office is responsible for summonsing or inviting Privy Counsellors and certain other dignitaries to the King’s accession, and so not all Counsellors will be in attendance.\n\nThe coronation of King Charles III\n\nYou can follow the coronation as it happens with our live blog here, and this is a full timetable of the coronation, and details of the concert.\n\nAhead of the ceremony, republican protesters were arrested before they could begin protests. New anti-protest laws were used to do it."
