The atmosphere around the ground before, during and after the game was superb. It was great to spend time with Garry Cook Jeremy Dale Steven Reed Steve Johnson Arabella Archer FEPAA FInstAM TCAP and hear about the ongoing transformation and exciting plans for the club. Saturday showed me just how much good a football club can do in the local community. It is clear that this club is going upwards and has an exciting future ahead. Well done to all involved. Even though I am an avid Wolves supporter, I want all of the Midlands Football Clubs to thrive and do well. It helps improve the whole region and supports the communities that we work and live in. Intercity offices are always full of friendly football rivalry, and monday mornings are always dominated by football stories of delight and despair. An age old tradition that is still going strong. #football #community #itservices Chris Sharp Fay Elmi\n\nIt was a busy and enjoyable end to the week last week. Thursday evening was the Lord's Taverners Charitable Programmes pre Test Dinner. A fantastic charity and a superb event. Sir Curtly Ambrose and Sir Gordon Greenidge entertained the audience with stories from their amazing careers. I didn‚Äôt realise how tall Sir Curtly Ambrose was! Friday morning I was up early for the Greater Birmingham Chambers of Commerce Board meeting. An excellent meeting with presentations from the Chamber team on the many actvities that are supporting local businesses. Over 2300 of them. I urge more businesses in the area to join this fantatsic network. I then shot over to the Test Match at Edgbaston Stadium and watched a superb first day of play between England and the West Indies. It was good to catch up with friends and colleagues from the business community. All are passionate about growing the prosperity for everyone in Birmingham and the West Midlands. I had a good chat with the impressive Preet Kaur Gill, MP for Edgbaston, and the West Midlands Mayor Richard Parker. Both are working tirelessly to improve our region. I also had the fortune to meet the West Indies cricketing and Warwickshire County Cricket Club legend Brian Lara. Intercity are proud to be the official IT partner for Edgbaston Stadium and it was great to meet the Intercity team who were working at the Stadium throughout the Test Match. It was clear that they take such pride and care in their roles. I am so proud of them. #Birmingham #WestMidlands #community Prof. Paul Cadman Ed James üöÄ Doug Wright MBE Stuart Cain Craig Flindall Fay Elmi Joanne Tomaszewska Neil Rampe Jeremy Dale\n\nThank you to Best Companies for the post below. I always enjoy sharing stories about my beloved team, Chasetown Football Club and my time Managing the team through our exciting FA Cup runs. I am sure a lot of people have learnt that there are many leadership lessons that we can take from sport into business and vice versa. And this short clip from the Best Companies live event earlier this year captures some of the lessons I have learned. I am very lucky and proud to have worked with such brilliant people in football and business. This is still the case - with the fantatsic teams at Intercity and Greater Birmingham Chambers of Commerce. I am still learning every day on how to become a better leader. I hope this short clip is useful. üëçüèª\n\nI had a great afternoon on Wednesday this week, attending the Parliamentary Launch of the West Midlands Business Commission - final report. This is an important and fantastic piece of work from the Greater Birmingham Chambers of Commerce and the Business Commission team. Well done to Henrietta Brealey Raj Kandola and all involved. The Churchill Rooms at the Houses of Parliament were packed with key stakeholders from the Midlands. It was clear to see that all attendees were passionate about continually developing our region and the communities we work in. It was great to meet the new Mayor of the West Midlands Richard Parker. It is still early days for him, and it is vital now we all collaborate and help him develop and deploy plans that will see the region grow and flourish. It is a big and exciting challenge and we all have a part to play. We have a lot to be proud of in Birmingham and the Midlands. A vibrant City, outstanding universities, fast growing sectors, and leading innovations. All supported by our biggest asset - our fantastic people. In my role as a Non-Executive Director at Greater Birmingham Chambers of Commerce, I see first hand, the vast array of brilliant businesses and talent that we have in the Midlands. It is inspiring. We all need to shout about it a bit more. At Intercity we are proud to be part of this technology and business eco-system, and to be playing our part in helping the region and our community grow and prosper. Exciting times ahead - let‚Äôs keep working together to make it happen. Prof Deborah Leary OBE D.Univ,FRSA Martin Ward Dr. A J. Nasir Awan MBE DL Declan Allen Steve Allen Mark Smith Joanna Birch Ruth Griffin Mark Taylor #technology #teamwork #community #transformation\n\nIt was a privilege to be interviewed by Jon Griffin for the Greater Birmingham Chambers of Commerce Chamber link magazine. It was great to reminisce about my career in business and my non-league football escapades. I have been very lucky to work with many brilliant people in both fields that have helped shape me personally and professionally. I have also a huge debt of gratitude to my wife, my 2 daughters and all of the mentors who have all given me advice and support in my journey. This interview also made me reflect again on the many crossovers in sport and business. I learnt so much in my time as manager of Chasetown Football Club. This is a very special community and football club that will always be in my heart. I have as much drive and enthusiasm now as I had when I started my career over 40 years ago. I work with brilliant people at Intercity and Greater Birmingham Chambers of Commerce and I am still learning every day. Two bits of advice that I can pass on to anyone starting out in their career is advice my Dad gave me from a young age. The two things he said to me before I started my apprenticeship were; 1. Always respect, and try to get on well with people. 2. No matter what you do, always give 100% and do your best. Two very basic things that have stuck with me in my career and life in general.

Attended by Sales Educators and Lecturers from Universities across the globe. I talked about our growth journey and ambitions at Intercity. And it was a good opportunity for me to reflect on the key ingredients that fuel growth. Having a clear strategy and a good business plan is key to growth. However, the most important factor is having a brilliant team to deliver the plan. I am very lucky, and very proud to have such a fantastic team of colleagues at Intercity that continue to go above and beyond for each other and our customers. #teamwork #customerservice #salesandmarketing\n\nWe had yet another fantastic Intercity Charity Golf Day yesterday. Our customers, partners and colleagues joined us to create memories in the sunshine while contributing generously to our chosen charity, Acorns Children's Hospice. We raised an amazing ¬£10k to go directly to helping the Birmingham-based charity provide vital care and support to babies, children and young people diagnosed with life-limited conditions and their families. We could not do this event without the generous support of our headlines sponsors, Check Point Software, Gamma and Freshwave. Thank you to Abigail Coulson and Louise Skidmore from Acorns Children's Hospice who gave an inspiring talk to everyone about the amazing work that is done supporting children and families at Acorns. We are very proud to help such a great charity that does a brilliant job in our community. #GivingBack #Teamwork #Community\n\nI was privileged to attend and present at the NMBS conference in Cyprus at the weekend. I have been to a lot of conferences in my career and this one was right up there in terms of attendees, speakers and organisation. Over 300 delegates attended from the building merchant business community. I gave a talk to delegates on the importance of managing the ever growing Cyber Risk in this, and other sectors. It was clear from speaking to delegates that this is a top business risk for them, and the talk had ‚Äòhit home‚Äô and reminded them to elevate their plans and focus. It was great to meet many of the delegates at this superb event and networking dinners. It was an absolute privilege to mix with this brilliant business network and chat to such genuinely good people. I am so pleased that this event has given them all the opportunity to reflect and take action on improving their Cyber Resilience.
