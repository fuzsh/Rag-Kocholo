        "text": "Of course, our world has changed fundamentally but it is onto this stage at Sheffield Park that the Armadillos CC have stepped and we are mindful of the spirit of the place and the history of the many great men who went before us.\n\nFounded in The Green Man public house in Hosted Keynes in 1983, the club until 2009 was a wandering side with no ground, no subscriptions and no written rules or constitution but a steadily increasing playing and social membership.\n\nNaming the club the Armadillos – for reasons not entirely clear at the time – was a master stroke. The name, as first chronicled by Rudyard Kipling and others, was descriptive of many of the club’s original members:\n\nArmadillos are slow and steady with a long tail, gregarious and like to come out at night.\n\nWith the considerable help of the National Trust and the generosity of the club’s members, Founder Members and Donors, the ground has been brought to life again. It is almost unique in the world of cricket for a former first-class ground to be resurrected after so many years of disuse. However, it would certainly be recognisable today to W.G., C.B. Fry, Ranji and others who played here all those years ago.\n\nArmadillos are now into our fifth year of residence at Sheffield Park. We have a fine pavilion, an improving square and outfield and a strong and growing fixture list. The Armadillos are proud to have their own home, identified by the unmistakeable colours flying above the pavilion and signifying the re-emergence of cricket at one of England’s finest old grounds.\n\nWe welcome new members young and old as the club is essentially a family club with ambitions to grow and play cricket at all levels.\n\nAnthony Scott-Gall – Club President\n\n“I tend to believe that cricket is the greatest thing that God ever created on earth” (Harold Pinter, Observer 5/10/1980)\n\nStaying with Harold Pinter’s beliefs concerning the almighty, Ray Illingworth made a similar observation also in 1980:\n\n“I am sure that the Almighty never intended that cricket should be played in anything but golden sunshine, especially if the wicket was doing a bit.”\n\nSince my first message the sun has not always shone on match days at Sheffield Park, but with the exception of summer 2012 we have been very lucky with our weather and the wicket has been doing “a bit” all summer. Only one match was cancelled due to the threat of rain which proved unfounded.\n\nWe have continued to develop and improve the square and outfield and many of our opponents have commented favourably. Much praise is due to The Chairman and Charlie Burchell who have given many hours of their time to the project.\n\nIn addition the National Trust now look after the park “ beyond the boundary “ to great effect. We have a wonderful ground set in true parkland as a result.\n\nThose visiting this website should see not only our impressive fixture list but read also the match reports for this year. They are lucid, erudite, and full of good humour and self deprecation-exactly what you would expect of the Armadillos. Our results for this season have been very good and congratulations to the Captain of Cricket and the match managers for putting out full teams for each match. Hugo, our captain of cricket leaves us for what we hope will only be a couple of years to work in New York. We wish him and his family well and hope that he will be back, wearing whites, very soon.\n\nOur residence at this wonderful groundhas been quite a learning curve in both ground, budget and match management. We have a full fixture list and a core of 40 regular players but as I said in my first message we welcome new playing members, young and old. Our aspiration is to play good cricket at all levels in a family friendly (and very safe) environment.\n\nAs John Arlott said in his book An Eye for Cricket: “ All cricketers are cricketers, none the less so for not being ‘first class’, which is no more than a statistical distinction”.\n\nThe cricket, the atmosphere and ambience at Sheffield Park is we like to think first class for which good fortune all Armadillos are due credit.\n\nI leave the last words of this second chapter to AA Milne, a keen cricketer, resident of Sussex and author of some repute. He could be speaking of cricket at Sheffield Park.\n\n“But what care I? It’s the game that calls me-\n\nSimply to be on the field of play:\n\nHow can it matter what fate befalls me,\n\nWith ten good fellows and one good day!”\n\nT S-G"
