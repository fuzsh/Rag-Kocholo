        "text": "The 35-year-old, assistant coach at the country’s top public school, Hilton College, near Martizburg, South Africa, was a fast bowler who took over 150 wickets in all cricket formats for the two counties before leaving the game in 2016 following a career plagued by injury. David also played for the England U19 team.\n\nLast year, David received a phone call that stunned him and his family.\n\n\"One day I came back home and my mum phoned me saying my sister had collapsed, he said, in an interview on the Professional Cricketers' Trust website.\n\n\"Shortly after, she had a phone call from the doctor saying based on blood tests she'd done at the hospital, they didn't even know how she was still speaking on the phone.\n\n\"They found she had kidney scarring and her kidneys went downhill very quickly from ten per cent to seven — and ending up at three per cent.\"\n\n“It’s a very heartbreaking thing to see a member of your family go through that pain, not knowing what’s going to happen the next day and going through your life not knowing how it’s going to move forward.\n\n“The fact that the Professional Cricketers’ Trust could get me through that situation to where I am today is such an amazing thing.\n\n\"Without the Trust, I don’t think we’d be here today.”\n\nEmma is recovering well from the transplant, the Griffiths family have said.\n\nThe trust is professional cricket’s leading charity that offers life-changing and often, as in David's case, life-saving support to trust members and their immediate families when they need it most.\n\nSupport offered by the trust can range from emotional counselling, right through to the provision of specialist medical equipment and more.\n\nDavid, best known as Griff, also played for Claremont, in Cape Town, and when coronavirus restrictions are lifted, Griff intends to marry his South African girlfriend.\n\nLast year, David came back to the Island to play in a special memorial match at Shanklin to honour the life of his late stepfather, Dave Porter."
