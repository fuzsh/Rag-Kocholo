This partnership isn't just about branding; it's about elevating the sport to new heights and driving its growth and development across the country. I believe this partnership is remarkable here's why- Increased Visibility: Coca-Cola is a globally recognized brand, and its association with Cricket Canada will undoubtedly increase the visibility of the sport.

Amul and Nandini, two of India's largest dairy brands, are sponsoring foreign teams in the ICC T20 World Cup 2024. Amul sponsors the USA and South Africa teams, while Nandini backs Ireland and Scotland. Here's why: 1. Global Exposure: These sponsorships provide international visibility and help expand their global market presence. 2. Cost-Effective: Sponsoring foreign teams is cheaper than sponsoring the Indian team, making it a cost-effective marketing strategy. 3. Market Penetration: It helps brands like Amul, which recently launched fresh milk in the USA, to tap into new markets. 4. Brand Building: Associating with an international sports event enhances brand image and recognition. However, this strategy isn't without challenges, including potential disconnect with the domestic market and financial risks if the expected ROI doesn't materialize. Amul and Nandini's moves reflect a strategic blend of cost management and global ambition, leveraging cricket's global appeal to boost their brands. #valuation #linkedn #finance\n\nSPORTS AND CULTURE Cricket, once America's national pastime, is gaining fans from coast to coast. While the game may be confusing to Americans, it's very British and played in 92 countries worldwide.

Meanwhile, a large West Indian woman is barbecuing jerk chicken, and reggae music fills the air. From the Caribbean to South Asia, cricket is making a comeback, with a massive influx of immigrants from India and Pakistan. Have you ever watched or played cricket?

If your sport is Australian Rules Football, how often does an opportunity like this come along? It isn't everyday you get to take to the footy field with the current AFL Games Record Holder, and a 4 time Premiership Player and Norm Smith Medalist. And how often does the chance to be coached by the greatest visionary of the modern era of the game of AFL come up? One thing that attributes value to something is it's rarity. Who do you know that would treasure this October Croatia Tour opportunity? To register their interest they just need to flick through an email to peter@aussierulesglobal.com.au Kevin Sheedy Isaac Smith Brent Harvey Richard Champion #croatiatour #australiankangaroosontour #aussieskippysontour #takingaussierulesglobal #gamedevelopment #culturalconnection #sportsdiplomacy #businessgrowthopportunity #internationalgrowth #internationalbusinessgrowth #communitydevelopment #businessdevelopment #onepercentadvantage #legacyopportunity\n\nAmul and Nandini are sponsoring 5 teams in the T20 World Cup, but India isn't one of them! Here's why‚Äì You see, Amul is sponsoring the cricket teams of Sri Lanka, South Africa, and the USA. On the other hand, Nandini is sponsoring Ireland and Scotland. But why aren‚Äôt either of the companies sponsoring Team India? Sounds strange, right?! Well, there is a good reason for this. Sponsoring the Indian cricket team is significantly more expensive compared to sponsoring foreign teams. For instance, in 2023, the Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) set a minimum price of Rs 350 crore for Team India‚Äôs lead sponsorship rights. In contrast, Nandini secured sponsorship for Ireland and Scotland for just Rs 2.5 crore per team! Now whenever any of the teams sponsored by Amul and Nandini will play against India, they will be able to reach their audience, for a fraction of the cost! Moreover, these sponsorships mark a significant milestone for both Amul and Nandini as they continue to expand their global footprint. Amul is set to launch its products in the USA and Nandini also has plans to go global. So, do you think by sponsoring foreign cricket teams Amul and Nandini will be able to make a mark in these markets?
