        "text": "Boris Johnson: Lord Heseltine discusses future of Brexit\n\nPenny Mordaunt is widely respected among Conservative Party members, who rank her as one of the favourites to take the reigns from Boris Johnson, according to a survey on July 12 by Conservative Home. Ms Mordaunt and former chancellor Rishi Sunak are among the favourites right now and are expected to put in a strong showing in the Tory leadership contest.\n\nWho is Penny Mordaunt?\n\nMs Mordaunt is MP for Portsmouth North, a post she has held since 2010 and has a majority of 15,000 votes.\n\nShe won the seat from Labour in the 2010 general election, proving her ability to turn key swing states blue.\n\nIn September last year, she was appointed Minister of State at the Department for International Trade, and has served in successive Conservative governments.\n\nUnder David Cameron, Ms Mordaunt served as minister for local government, as well as becoming the first woman to be appointed armed forces minister.\n\nAccording to her website, she was the first person in her family to go to university, and before politics she worked part-time alongside her Philosophy course at Reading.\n\nShe also had roles in communications and local government, and set up her own business before becoming director at Diabetes UK.\n\nREAD MORE: 'If Boris goes, Brexit goes' Lord predicts as issue now 'up for grabs'\n\nShe is a Brexiteer and backed the Vote Leave campaign in 2016 when the EU referendum was held.\n\nMs Mordaunt has accused the EU of “pushing its regulatory system on the rest of the world”, and described leaving the bloc as a “massive opportunity”.\n\nShe said in a speech last December: “Brexit is not an event to be mourned by the international community. Or an act of self-harm or one that requires us to be punished.\n\n“It is a massive opportunity to anyone who believes in democracy and the power of trade as a force for good in the world.”\n\nInvalid email\n\nWe use your sign-up to provide content in ways you've consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

Read our Privacy Policy\n\nWhy is she one of the favourites?\n\nIn the 2019 Tory leadership race, Ms Mordaunt did not stand, but instead endorsed Jeremy Hunt.\n\nShe has called for tax cuts as a way to boost the economy, going against Rishi Sunak’s approach which has seen National Insurance and corporation tax go up.\n\nWhen she launched her Tory leadership campaign, she described herself as the candidate \"Labour fears the most\", and said the Conservative Party had \"lost its sense of self\" in recent times.\n\nHer promises included low taxes, a small state, and an emphesis on personal respinsibiity.\n\nDON'T MISS:\n\nMichael Gove SACKED: Boris wields axe after ex-ally demanded PM resign [ANALYSIS]‘You’ve never run a Governent department!’ Nick Robinson erupts at min [REACTION]Why Queen will now play crucial role in end of Boris Johnson as PM[INSIGHT]\n\nOther favourites in the race include former chancellor Rishi Suank, and Liz Truss, the foreign secretary.\n\nMr Sunak was an ally of Mr Johnson, but it was his resignation in the days before the Prime Minister announced he was stepping down, that led to a mass walk out in the Government.\n\nMs Truss has served key roles in British politics, and previously worked as a trade minister, helping to secure post-Brexit trade arangements with some of the world's biggest economies.\n\nTory MPs will vote on who they want to become the next prime minister, before the wider Tory membership has the final say, and Britain's next prime minister is announced on September 5.\n\nBut not all Tories are behind Ms Mordaunt, and some question whether she is the right person to take over the top job.\n\nStephen Carlton-Woods, 57, is a conservative political commentator who explained that he believes there are more suitable candidates.\n\nHe told Express.co.uk: “Penny is a lovely lady, but I don’t think she is a traditional Conservative, and I think whoever leads the party has to be a traditional Tory.”\n\nLoyalties within the party are divided, and these will be played out publicly when the Conservative leadership election rolls around.\n\nThe new prime minister will take charge from September, and lead the Tory party into its conference in October, setting out the proprities of the new government.\n\nThe party wanted to have a new leader in place as it begins its campaign for the general election in 2024.\n\nIn the polls, the Labour Party and Sir Keir Starmer are comfortably ahead right now, and look likely to hold onto that after this week’s events.\n\nBut a new Tory leader could change the situation over the next 12 months if the party is able to find a leader who can bring its election chances back to life."
