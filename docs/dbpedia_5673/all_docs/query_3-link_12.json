This is an opportunity to recognise women who are at the top of their game and who are making sure strong female voices are being heard in the corridors of power. They are also role models for the next generation of female leaders and by showcasing their achievements, we can help those young women fulfil their potential too.\n\nâ€” Sharon Doherty, Chief People and Places Officer\n\nTo find out more about Lloyds Banking Group, click here"
