        "text": "Amul and Nandini are sponsoring 5 teams in the T20 World Cup, but India isn't one of them! Here's why– You see, Amul is sponsoring the cricket teams of Sri Lanka, South Africa, and the USA. On the other hand, Nandini is sponsoring Ireland and Scotland. But why aren’t either of the companies sponsoring Team India? Sounds strange, right?! Well, there is a good reason for this. Sponsoring the Indian cricket team is significantly more expensive compared to sponsoring foreign teams. For instance, in 2023, the Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) set a minimum price of Rs 350 crore for Team India’s lead sponsorship rights. In contrast, Nandini secured sponsorship for Ireland and Scotland for just Rs 2.5 crore per team! Now whenever any of the teams sponsored by Amul and Nandini will play against India, they will be able to reach their audience, for a fraction of the cost! Moreover, these sponsorships mark a significant milestone for both Amul and Nandini as they continue to expand their global footprint. Amul is set to launch its products in the USA and Nandini also has plans to go global. So, do you think by sponsoring foreign cricket teams Amul and Nandini will be able to make a mark in these markets? Let us know in the comments and follow Finshots for more!"
