        "text": "The Tories plunged into fresh civil war as different factions accused each other of promoting a plot to oust Rishi Sunak.\n\nAfter a torrid week for Mr Sunak, rumours emerged over the weekend that fed up MPs want to topple the Prime Minister so Penny Mordaunt can lead the party into the next election. Panicking backbenchers, who are disillusioned by Mr Sunak’s failure to chip into Labour’s poll lead, were said to be considering uniting around Ms Mordaunt to prevent electoral wipeout.\n\nBut allies of Ms Mordaunt, the Commons leader, insisted the plotting wasn't being driven by her camp and blamed right-wingers for whipping it up. And top Tory Sir Jake Berry accused \"inept\" No10 aides of briefing he was behind the conspiracy to impose a fourth Prime Minister since 2019.\n\nIt comes after a dire week for Mr Sunak following the defection of ex-Tory Deputy Chairman Lee Anderson to Reform UK and a political storm over Tory donor Frank Hester’s alleged racist remarks about MP Diane Abbott. With Tory MPs increasingly worried about losing the seats, the Daily Mail and Daily Telegraph suggested MPs on the right of the party met moderates this week to discuss uniting behind Ms Mordaunt.\n\nBut one Conservative MP told the Mirror: \"Penny has nothing to do with this. She probably thinks it’s pretty ironic that the people who prevented her from being on the ballot are now the one’s pushing her. We need to get behind Rishi.\" Another source close to Ms Mordaunt said: \"This is being briefed by people who know it is unhelpful to Penny and unhelpful to the PM.\"\n\nFormer Cabinet Minister David Davis said: \"When I go out on the doors, people don't say to me, 'Why haven't you cut immigration numbers?' They say, 'Why can't you get your act together?' And they don't mean Rishi Sunak, they are talking about my colleagues who are creating negative headlines every five minutes.\" He added: \"This is coming from her enemies, not her friends.\"\n\nAn MP on the right of the party downplayed the claims but added: \"Not that this means people are happy or positive at all. Real mood of gloom around.\"\n\nFormer Cabinet Minister Sir Jake Berry accused \"inept\" No10 officials of briefing that he was pushing the plot. He told TimesRadio: \"It's categorically incorrect. I understand that No10 is briefing it out, purposely. It speaks to how incompetent the advisers around Rishi Sunak are.\"\n\nDo you think Penny Mordaunt is a better choice for Tory leader? Vote in our poll HERE to have your say.\n\nTransport Secretary Mark Harper was forced to insist that the Prime Minister would still be in place at the next election amid claims his fed up backbenchers want to replace him. Deluded Mr Harper also claimed the Conservatives will win despite trailing Labour in the national polls and facing a 1997-style wipeout.\n\nAsked by Sky News whether Mr Sunak will still be leader of the Tories when the election is called, he replied: \"Yes he will. And he will take us into that election and he will set out very clearly that we're a Government with a plan. \"I'm going to be supporting him all the way through and I'm confident that my colleagues will.\" He added: \"Politics is a team game.\"\n\nShadow Paymaster General Jon Ashworth said the country needed a reprieve from endless Tory infighting. He told Sky News: “This is not in the national interest anymore. It is irresponsible. We need stability in this country. He [Sunak] could stabilise this by naming the date of a general election. Otherwise, I fear we may have a Tory leadership election ahead of a general election.”\n\nA No10 source said: \"PM is focused on delivering on his plan to build a brighter Britain, which is starting to work with inflation down, wages up, mortgages down, the economy forecast to grow and the boats down by a third.\""
