        "text": "She has handled policy of all kinds from rights for disabled people, to cyber security and the defence of the realm.\n\nBefore Penny became the first female defence secretary, she was the secretary of state for international development. These are both roles representing Britain abroad. She executed them brilliantly.\n\nIn her political career, Penny has taken on some harrowing cases. As international development secretary, she dealt with the fallout from Oxfam’s appalling misconduct in Haiti, tackling their failure of \"moral leadership\".\n\nAt the Cabinet Office, as paymaster-general, she was instrumental in setting up a public inquiry into the NHS’s use of infected blood products.\n\nAgain and again, it was the same pattern: tough questions, heart-rending personal stories, delicate judgement and clear-headed decision-making. She passed every test with flying colours.\n\nPenny knows that when she takes over, she will have to right the ship. That will require some tough choices and innovative thinking.\n\nThere is no doubt over what kind of prime minister Penny will be. She will be a proper Conservative prime minister.\n\nPenny’s government will focus on the things that really matter to people in every part of the UK: cost of living, healthcare and education. And the best way to do that is to reset the offer the Conservative Party is making to the country.\n\nOur nation is facing huge challenges and Penny’s first day in Downing Street will be daunting. But she has proven, time and again she is up to the task.\n\nShe was brave when it came to the Chequers compromise and stood up for the 17.4 million people who voted to leave the European Union.\n\nShe called out Angela Rayner’s hypocrisy on political donations. She performs brilliantly in the House of Commons.\n\nShe also translates across the UK. In Scotland, in Wales, in Northern Ireland, in the Red Wall, in the Blue Wall, older voters and younger voters are all ready to listen to her.\n\nThat is why she is \"Labour’s worst nightmare\". She is everything Sir Keir Starmer would wish to be.\n\nIn fact, only minutes before voting in the second ballot closed, an independent focus group published findings showing that, in the Red Wall, Penny would beat Sir Keir handsomely.\n\nThe other candidates do not fare as well.\n\nWe know that Penny can win. She can win against Labour; against the Liberal Democrats; against the SNP; and crucially against every other candidate in this race. If only given the chance.\n\nIn this leadership election, the Party faces a choice. A choice between a few candidates, who are very talented but who represent business as usual, and someone who will change things for the better.\n\nWhat Penny represents is a reset. A reset the Party and the country desperately need.\n\nNow my colleagues in the parliamentary Conservative Party must give our members, in every part of the UK, the chance to vote for that reset - for low taxes, for a smaller state, for Penny – Britain's next Prime Minister."
