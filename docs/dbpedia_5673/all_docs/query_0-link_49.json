He was educated at a private school in London, his father had settled there in 1852, and at a college at Beauchamp in France, where he acquired complete proficiency in French. In later years he showed a good working knowledge of both German and Italian. His father decided to emigrate to Australia, and landed at Melbourne with his family in January 1857. After a period at St Patrick's college, the boy went on to the university of Melbourne, took his B.A. degree in 1864, LL.B. in 1865 and LL.D. in 1869. When J. F. James, registrar of the university, died in 1864, Madden carried on his duties for a short period and was an unsuccessful applicant for the vacant position. He was called to the bar on 14 September 1865, and was quickly recognized as one of the coming men, at first on the equity side and afterwards in criminal cases. In 1871 he attempted to enter parliament as the representative for West Bourke in the legislative assembly. He was defeated, but was returned at the next election. He joined the McCulloch (q.v.) ministry as minister for justice in October 1875 and, though he lost his seat on going before his constituents, he was retained in the ministry until 1876 when he was returned for Sandridge. McCulloch resigned in May 1877, but in March 1880 Madden became minister of justice in the Service (q.v.) ministry, which, however, lasted only five months. Madden's practice became so large that in 1883 he retired from politics. He was now one of the leaders of the bar and for many years was a rival to J. L. Purves (q.v.), though his methods were quite different. As an advocate, his good humour and unvarying courtesy was backed by a knowledge of the law and a complete grasp of the facts which were the results of great industry. He more than once declined a judgeship, but when Chief-justice Higinbotham (q.v.) died at the end of 1892, Madden was given his position in January 1893. It has been stated that he was earning about £8000 a year at this time, and the acceptance of this office meant a considerable monetary sacrifice.\n\nBesides carrying out the duties of the chief-justice Madden did important work in other directions. He was vice-chancellor of the university of Melbourne from 1889 to 1897, and chancellor from 1897 until his death. He was a regular attendant at council meetings and public functions and an admirable chairman of committees. On special occasions he could always be relied upon to make dignified and eloquent speeches, and he never felt it was the duty of a chancellor to interfere in any way with the professors in the conduct of their departments. All this led to the smooth running of the institution and he earned the respect and affection of both the staff and the students. He administered the government of Victoria on several occasions from 1893 onwards, and was formally appointed lieutenant-governor in 1899. He carried out his duties with great success, associating himself with every movement likely to be for the good of the state, and showing himself to be equal to any constitutional problems which arose. He died suddenly on 10 March 1918. He married in 1872, Gertrude Frances Stephen, who survived him with one son and five daughters. He was knighted in 1893, made a K.C.M.G. in 1899, and G.C.M.G. in 1906.\n\nMadden was interested in every form of sport and also in country life. He was neither a great lawyer nor a great judge, but he had a good knowledge of case law and was a master of practice. During his early years on the bench his decisions were fairly often upset on appeal. It has been said of him that at times he lacked that happy welding together of ascertained fact and appropriate law . . . which renders decisions practically unappealable\" but he was generally a sound judge, independent and capable, whose rulings were always marked by common sense. He understood too how judicial kindliness could be backed by sufficient firmness. Before he became a judge he was a great advocate, with a fine voice, an engaging address and a deceptive good humour which masked a knowledge of the facts, and of human nature and its frailties. He had all the qualities needed for a good lieutenant-governor; good-humour without loss of dignity, an unforced hospitality, sufficient knowledge of constitutional practice, and much popularity with all classes of the community.\n\nA younger brother, Sir Frank Madden (1847-1921), became a member of the Victorian legislative assembly in 1894 and was elected speaker in 1904. He held his position until he lost his seat in parliament at the 1917 election. He was an excellent speaker, courteous, impartial and firm, and had the respect of the house. He took a great interest in agriculture and irrigation and in 1895 published a pamphlet Grass Lands of Victoria. He died at Melbourne on 17 February 1921. He was knighted in June 1911. Another brother, Walter Madden (1848-1925), also entered parliament and represented the Wimmera for many years. He was president of the board of land and works in the O'Loghlan ministry from 1881 to 1883.\n\nThe Argus, 11 March 1918; The Cyclopaedia of Victoria, 1903; Sir Ernest Scott, A History of the University of Melbourne; Men of the Time in Australia, 1878; P.

He was taken to Sydney when 10 years old and studied at the Academy of Art. His work was accepted by the Bulletin and he became known for his excellent drawings of horses. In 1889 his oil painting \"Rounding up a Straggler\", was bought for the national gallery of New South Wales, and in 1896 \"The Cry of the Mothers\" was also purchased. He did a good deal of illustrative work for the Picturesque Atlas of Australia, Victoria and its Metropolis, the Antipodean and other magazines of the period, and was also responsible for some of the illustrations to Boake's (q.v.) Where the Dead Men Lie. He left for England in 1904 but his health became impaired and he had little success in England as an artist. Nothing appears to be known about his later days. He died in London in June 1916. He was a capable painter of animals, and is represented in the Sydney, Hobart and Wanganui, New Zealand, galleries.\n\nW. Moore, The Story of Australian Art; P. S. Cleary, Australia's Debt to Irish Nation Builders; The Bulletin, 24 and 31 August 1916.\n\n^Top of page\n\nMAIDEN, JOSEPH HENRY (1859-1925),\n\nbotanist,\n\nson of Henry Maiden, was born at St John's Wood, London, on 25 April 1859. He was educated at the city of London middle class school and the university of London, but was unable on account of his health to finish his science course. Having been ordered a sea voyage he came to Australia in 1880, and was connected with the formation of the technological museum at Sydney. In 1881 he was appointed its curator and continued in this position until 1896. He was much interested in the native plants, and in his early days was associated with the Rev. William Woolls (q.v.) in his botanical studies. In his first book, The Useful Native Plants of Australia, published in 1889, he also acknowledges his debt to the work of von Mueller (q.v.) with whom he had been in correspondence. In 1890 Maiden was appointed consulting botanist to the New South Wales department of agriculture and forestry, in 1892 he published a Bibliography of Australian Economic Botany, and in 1894 he was made superintendent of technical education. He gave up this position in 1896 when he was appointed government botanist and director of the botanic gardens, Sydney. He had in the previous year brought out Part I of The Flowering Plants and Ferns of New South Wales, of which other parts appeared in this and in later years. In 1903 his Critical Revision of the Genus Eucalyptus, possibly his most important work, began to appear; at the time of his death it was practically completed, 65 parts having been issued. Ten additional parts, edited by R. H. Gambage and W. F. Blakely were published by 1931 and an index to parts 71-5 appeared in 1933. Another valuable work, the Forest Flora of New South Wales, was published in parts between 1904 and 1924, and his Illustrations of New South Wales Plants began to appear in 1907. In 1909 Maiden published Sir Joseph Banks the \"father of Australia\", a mine of valuable information though lacking arrangement. His industry, however, was remarkable. Either alone or associated with colleagues he contributed 45 papers to the Journal of the Royal Society of New South Wales, and 87 to the Proceedings of the Linnean Society of New South Wales. He lectured to university students on \"agricultural botany\" and \"forest botany\"; he was honorary secretary of the Royal Society of New South Wales for 22 years and was twice president; he was for 14 years honorary secretary of the Australasian Association for the Advancement of Science, and in 1921 was offered the presidency but had to decline it on account of his health; he was for 35 years on the council of the Linnean Society and president for three years. In 1916, in collaboration with Ernst Betche, he published A Census of New South Wales Plants, and in 1920 Maiden published Part I of The Weeds of New South Wales. Though handicapped in his later years by ill-health, he continued to do much valuable work both in systematic botany and in forestry until his retirement in April 1924. He died on 16 November 1925. He married in 1883, Jeannie, daughter of John Hammond, who survived him with four daughters. He was awarded the Linnean medal by the Linnean Society of London in 1915, was elected a fellow of the Royal Society of London in the following year, was awarded the Mueller medal by the Australasian Association for the Advancement of Science in 1922, and the Clarke medal by the Royal Society of New South Wales in 1924.\n\nMaiden was a kindly, sincere man, with a sense of humour, and a wealth of information which was always at the service of his fellow scientific workers. He was both methodical and enthusiastic, had immense powers of work, and his name deservedly ranks high among the botanists of Australia. In addition to the books mentioned, some of Maiden's writings were published as pamphlets, including an interesting series of biographical notes concerning the former officers in charge of the Sydney botanic gardens.\n\nProceedings of the Linnean Society of New South Wales, 1926, p.

He was educated at the Bishop's college and was articled in 1844 to W. M. Peniston, one of Brunel's engineers engaged in railway work in the west of England. In 1850 Mais went to Sydney intending to start an engineering business, but in 1851 was appointed as engineer to the Sydney Railway Company, and he afterwards joined the service of the Sydney city commissioners. In 1862 he went to Melbourne as manager to the Melbourne Suburban and Brighton railway, but in 1866 this company was taken over by the state, and Mais obtained a position with the water-supply department. In 1867 he was appointed engineer-in-chief to the colony of South Australia and in January 1871 general-manager of railways. Following a re-arrangement of the departments in 1878 Mais retained the positions of engineer-in-chief and engineer for railways and harbours and jetties. In April 1888 he voluntarily resigned. His 21 years of service in South Australia was a period of great expansion, much money was spent, and Mais saw that it was well spent. He had great skill in his profession and never allowed unsound work to pass. After his retirement he went to Melbourne, for the next 25 years practised as a consulting engineer and arbitrator, and established a wide reputation. He retired in 1912, and died at Melbourne in his eighty-ninth year on 25 February 1916. His wife predeceased him, and he was survived by three sons and two daughters.\n\nP.

Maitland, surveyor, was born at Tumut, New South Wales, on 12 November 1868. He was educated at Newington College and the university of Sydney, where he graduated M.B., Ch.M., in 1892. He was appointed to the resident staff of the Sydney hospital and served for more than two years both as house-surgeon and house-physician. He started practice in 1894 in Elizabeth-street, Sydney, three years later was appointed honorary assistant surgeon at the Sydney hospital, and gained much valuable experience. He was appointed honorary surgeon in 1902 and was largely instrumental in the improvement of the hospital facilities. The hospital became a clinical school for the university in 1908 and Maitland was made clinical lecturer. He was much interested in the New South Wales branch of the British Medical Association, was a member of the council from 1904 to 1915, and president 1911-12. When the South Sydney hospital was founded he became honorary surgeon and held the same position at the Royal Hospital for Women, and the Coast hospital. During the 1914-18 war Maitland was attached to the military forces at Randwick hospital and did very valuable work. He had a severe attack of influenza in 1919, but apparently completely recovered from the effects of it. In 1920 a lecture hall was built at the Sydney hospital which was called the Maitland lecture hall, and contained a tablet inscribed \"Erected in Recognition of the Services to this Hospital as Surgeon and Lecturer by Sir Herbert Lethington Maitland 1920\". In 1921 he became senior surgeon of this hospital and though working hard he was seldom tired, and showed no signs of weakness of health. However, on 23 May 1923, after a few minutes illness, he died at his rooms before medical assistance could reach him. He married in 1898, Mabel Agnes, daughter of Samuel Cook, who survived him with two sons. He was knighted in 1915.\n\nMaitland was an athlete in his youth and played first grade Rugby football. He was of a kindly disposition, solicitous for his patients, and had many friends. As a clinical lecturer he was clear in his exposition and eminently practical and instructive. His work for Sydney hospital was of great value as was also his experience when dealing with war-wrecked soldiers. As a surgeon he had great dexterity and manipulative skill, and when an emergency arose could always find the safest way of dealing with it. It was stated at the time of his death that he had operated on 4000 cases of appendicitis without losing a patient. His experience was purely Australian; he was the first graduate from an Australian university to receive an honorary surgical appointment at a Sydney hospital, and he never sought to enlarge his experience by visiting Europe. He also wrote little and his reputation was practically confined to his own country. A paper contributed to the Australasian Medical Gazette in 1906 on his method of extirpating malignant growths in the neck led, however, to his being invited to contribute an article on this operation to J. F. Binnie's Manual of Operative Surgery. In Australia he was recognized as an authority in surgery and a master of surgical technique. A memorial to his memory was founded by subscription at the Sydney hospital.\n\nThe Medical journal of Australia, 23 June 1923, 7 June 1924; The Sydney Morning Herald, 24 May 1923; Burke's Peerage, etc., 1923.\n\n^Top of page\n\nMANNING, FREDERIC (1882-1935),\n\nauthor,\n\nwas born at Sydney on 22 July 1882, the fourth son of Sir William Patrick Manning (1845-1915), and his wife Nora, daughter of John Torpy. Both parents were of Irish descent. Sir William Manning, an accountant and financial agent, was Mayor of Sydney from 1891 to 1894, and represented South Sydney for a period in the legislative assembly. He was knighted in 1894. His son, Frederic, a delicate boy, except for about six months at Sydney grammar school, was educated privately. He was taken to England at the age of 15 by Arthur Galton, who had been private secretary to Sir Robert Duff, governor of New South Wales from 1893 to 1895. Galton was a university man who had joined the Roman Catholic Church and had become a priest in 1880. He left that ministry in 1885, was re-admitted to the Church of England in December 1898, took orders, and subsequently wrote several books on theological questions. He was probably responsible for Manning's classical education, as the boy was at school for only six months in England, and did not go to a university. Manning's first volume of verse, The Vision of Brunhild, was published in 1907, and in the same year he became a literary reviewer on the London Spectator. In 1909 he published a remarkable volume of prose, Scenes and Portraits, highly praised by such distinguished critics as Max Beerbohm and E. M. Forster, but for long known only to a discerning few. Another volume of verse, Poems, appeared in 1910.\n\nIn 1915 Manning enlisted in the Shropshire light infantry as a private. He was offered a commission but declined it because he felt he had none of the qualities required for an officer. Some of the earlier poems in Eidola, published in 1917, reflect his war experiences. He collaborated with T. S. Eliot and R. Aldington in the production of a small volume of essays, Poetry and Prose, published in 1921, and he was asked by the British government to collaborate with Sir George Arthur in writing the life of Kitchener. Illness prevented him from doing so but he was able to undertake The Life of Sir William White, director of British naval construction, a conscientious piece of work on a subject quite alien from Manning's way of life. This volume appeared in 1923, and was followed in 1926 by an edition of Walter Charleton's translation of Epicurus's Morals with a long introductory essay. Persuaded by his friend and publisher Peter Davies, Manning wove his war experiences into a novel published anonymously in 1929, The Middle Parts of Fortune: Somme and Ancre, by Private 19022, of which an abridged edition with the title Her Privates We, came out in the following year. It was well reviewed and four impressions were printed in January 1930. But the public was getting tired of novels based on the war, and the book had less success than it deserved. In November 1930 a revised and slightly enlarged edition of Scenes and Portraits was published and in February 1933 Manning visited Australia. He died in England from pneumonia after a short illness, on 22 February 1935. He was unmarried. An elder brother, Sir Henry Edward Manning, born in 1877, became attorney-general and vice-president of the executive council of New South Wales in 1932 and was created K.B.E. in 1939.\n\nManning suffered from bronchial asthma all his life, and though he was occupied for a long period on a novel of the time of Louis XIV, never had the energy to finish it. He was a solitary and a scholar, shy and sensitive, always seeking to avoid notice. Yet among congenial friends his talk was witty and profound, his observations as quick as his understanding. His verse is excellent, technically speaking, but his emotion seems scarcely deeply or sharply enough felt to give him an important place as a poet. His prose is in the highest class, Scenes and Portraits, partly short stories and partly imaginary conversations, has wit and humour, irony and wisdom expressed with a perfection of phrase unexcelled by any other writer born in Australia. Her Privates We gave the life of the soldier at the front with an honesty and accuracy which placed it in the front rank of books of its kind. The character of Bourne in this book is probably based on the author.\n\nThe Times, 26 February 1935; The Sydney Morning Herald, 25 February 1935; Nettie Palmer, The Bulletin, 22 March 1933; E.

He was educated at private schools and University College, London, and was entered at Lincoln's Inn in November 1827. He was called to the bar in November 1832 and practised as a barrister on the Western Circuit for about five years. During this period, in collaboration with S. Neville, he prepared and published Reports of Cases Relating to the Duty and Offices of Magistrates (3 vols, 1834-8), and was the author of Proceedings in Courts of Revision in the Isle of Wight, etc. (1836). In 1837 he went to Australia and soon after his arrival was made a chairman of quarter sessions. He took up his duties at Bathurst in October. In 1842 he was offered the position of resident judge at Port Phillip, and in September 1844 became solicitor-general of New South Wales. In January 1848 he was appointed acting-judge of the supreme court of New South Wales during the absence of Mr Justice Therry (q.v.). He resumed the solicitor-generalship at the end of 1849, and held this position until responsible government was established in 1856, when he retired with a pension of £800 a year. He had been a nominated member of the legislative council since February 1851, and assisted in the preparation of Wentworth's (q.v.) constitution bill.\n\nManning was elected a member of the legislative assembly in the first parliament, and was attorney-general in the Donaldson (q.v.) ministry from 6 June to 25 August 1856. He was given the same position in the Parker (q.v.) ministry in October 1856, but resigned in the following May on account of ill-health, and went to England. On his return he was offered a judgeship of the supreme court but declined it. He re-entered parliament and on 21 February 1860 joined the Forster (q.v.) ministry as attorney-general, but the ministry resigned about a fortnight later. He was again attorney-general in the Robertson (q.v.) and Cowper (q.v.) ministries from October 1868 to December 1870. In February 1875, though he was then a member of the upper house he was asked to form a ministry, but was unable to obtain sufficient support. He was appointed a supreme court judge in 1876, and was primary judge in equity until his resignation in 1887. He voluntarily gave up his pension when he became a judge. In 1887 he was again nominated to the legislative council, and gave useful service there until near the end of his life. He had been elected a fellow of the senate of the university of Sydney in 1861, became chancellor in 1878 and held this position until his death on 27 February 1895.\n\nBefore Manning came into office the university had been languishing for some time, there were fewer than a hundred students in 1877, but during his chancellorship there was much expansion in the scope of the university and several new chairs were founded. He fought for and succeeded in getting increased grants from the government, urged the necessity of more grammar schools being established, and the provision of university scholarships. He pleaded that women should have the same opportunities as men at the university and this was granted in 1881. He carried out his duties with sagacity and devotedness; one example of this was his saving the university £15,000 by his discovery that the British taxation commissioners were charging succession duty on the Challis estate on too high a scale. Few men in New South Wales had such a long career of usefulness.\n\nHis portrait by Sir John Watson Gordon, paid for by public subscription is in the great hall at Sydney university. He was knighted in 1858 and created K.C.M.G. in 1892. He was married twice (1) to Emily Anne, daughter of E. Wise, and (2) to Eliza Anne, daughter of the Very Rev. William Sowerby, and was survived by children of both marriages.\n\nThe Sydney Morning Herald, 28 February 1895; H. E.

His father was a builder and hotelkeeper, and while quite a boy Marchant became interested in the temperance question. He came to Brisbane when he was 16 with only a few shillings in his pocket, and began to work as a gardener for ten shillings a week and his keep. He was afterwards a station-hand in the country, but returned to Brisbane and obtained work as a carter for an aerated-waters factory. He acquired a small business of this kind in 1886, and opened a factory in Bower-street, Brisbane, in 1888, which grew into the largest business of its kind in Australia with other factories at Sydney, Melbourne, Adelaide and Newcastle. While a young man Marchant invented and patented a bottling machine afterwards used all over the world. He married Mary Jane Dwyer, and with her spent much money in discriminating charity, of which little was known until he made his gift of £41,000 for the building of the Canberra hotel for the temperance organizations. Other important benefactions were the Montrose Crippled Children's Home; the Kingshome Home for Soldiers; the Garden Home for the Aged, Chermside; the City Mission Home, Palm Beach; The Paddington Creche and Kindergarten; Swedenborgian Churches in Australia, England and U.S.A.; and the Home for Crippled Children, Boston, U.S.A. He also gave the land for Marchant Park at Kedron, a suburb of Brisbane. He died On 5 September 1941. His wife died in 1925, and they had no children.\n\nMarchant was a religious, kind, and sympathetic man, who believed that all religions should be related to life. Under his will various bequests were made to relatives, friends and institutions. The largest was £16,500 to the Queensland Society for Crippled Children, which will also receive the residue of his estate.\n\nThe Courier-Mail, Brisbane, 6 and 7 September 1941; The Telegraph, Brisbane, 5 September 1941.\n\n^Top of page\n\nMARSDEN, SAMUEL (1764-1838),\n\nearly clergyman and missionary to New Zealand,\n\nwas born at Farsley, Yorkshire, England, on 28 July 1764. (Jnl and Proc. R.A.H.S., vol. IX, p. 79). His father, Thomas Marsden, was a blacksmith and small farmer. Marsden had only an elementary education and when he grew up assisted his father at his work. When he was 21 his thoughts turned to the ministry, and between 1787 and 1793 he received help from the Elland Clerical Society. which had a fund for the education of young men of good character without the means to fit themselves for entering the church. Marsden had a course of preliminary study under the Rev. E. Storrs and the Rev. Miles Atkinson. both of Leeds, and then proceeded to Hull grammar school. In 1790 he became a sizar of Magdalene College, Cambridge, and there he remained for two and a half years, leaving without a degree to accept the position of assistant chaplain in New South Wales. His commission was dated 1 January 1793; on the following 24 May he was ordained deacon, and two days later priest. He had married on 21 April, Elizabeth, only daughter of Thomas Fristan, and on 1 July they sailed on the William which arrived at Sydney on 10 March 1794. Marsden made his home at Parramatta, but early in 1795 Lieutenant-governor Paterson (q.v.) sent him to Norfolk Island, then being administered by Captain King (q.v.). The visit had far-reaching consequences because King had been much impressed by the intelligence of two young Maoris who had been kidnapped and brought to the island, in the hope that they might be able to give instruction in preparing flax which grew there luxuriantly. His account of the young men interested Marsden very much, but many years were to pass before he was able to visit New Zealand. In September 1795 he returned to New South Wales, and in the same month Captain Hunter (q.v.) began his duties as governor.\n\nNeither Johnson (q.v.), the first clergyman, nor Marsden had received any support from Lieut.-governors Grose (q.v.) and Paterson (q.v.). Hunter did his best to combat the evil influences at work in the settlement, and Marsden's influence on the life of the colony was increasingly felt. Writing to a friend in December 1796 he said \"I have much to occupy my time, and a great variety of duties to perform. I am a gardener, a farmer, a magistrate, a minister, so that when one duty does not call, another does. In this infant colony there is plenty of manual labour for everybody. I conceive it a duty to all to take an active part. He who will not labour must not eat. Now is our harvest time. Yesterday I was in the field assisting getting my wheat. To-day I was sitting in the civil court hearing the complaints of the people. To-morrow, if well, must ascend the pulpit and preach to my people. In this manner I chiefly spend my time\". (Jnl and Proc. R.A.H.S., vol. XII, p. 263). Marsden had been given a grant of 100 acres soon after his arrival, with the use of convict labour, and showed himself to be an excellent farmer. Later on he was given further grants of land and took an interest in sheep-breeding, and though his efforts may not be compared with those of Macarthur (q.v.), his experiments were of great use in the early development of the wool industry. In 1806 he owned some 1400 sheep out of the 21,400 in the colony, and had nearly 3000 acres of land. After the Rev. Richard Johnson left the colony in 1800 Marsden carried on the chaplain's work single-handed for several years, and when later on he came in conflict with Governor Macquarie (q.v.) indignantly denied that his farming operations had in any way interfered with the carrying out of his clerical duties. This is borne out in the report made to the British house of commons by J. T. Bigge (q.v.) in 1823. Marsden's duties as a magistrate, however, were less in keeping with his office. He ordered floggings for what would in the present day be considered minor offences, and though not mentioned by name, he was evidently \"the clerical magistrate of another creed\" who awarded the \"scourge to Irish catholics for refusing to enter the protestant churches . . . the plea to be sure, was obstinacy and disobedience\" (W. Ullathorne (q.v.) The Catholic Mission in Australasia, p. 9). Marsden considered he was doing his duty, it was a cruel and intolerant age, and he was not in advance of his time. His own view was that he was a strict but not a severe magistrate. He said \"I conceive there is a very material difference between severity and strictness . . . I ever considered that the certainty of punishment operated more powerfully upon the mind of the delinquent than the severity of punishment; and upon this principle I acted. . . . A magistrate has a duty which he owes to the public as well as to the delinquents, and he is not justified in remitting punishments where the safety and well-being of the community call for their infliction\" (An Answer to Certain Calumnies, p. 38). As a magistrate Marsden was trusted by the successive governors, and on more than one occasion important commissions were entrusted to him, such as the investigation into the conditions and grievances of settlers in 1798.\n\nIn 1807 Marsden and his wife visited England. There he was able to bring before the authorities the need for more clergy in Australia, and when news of the deposition of Bligh (q.v.) reached England, Marsden's knowledge of the local conditions must have been very useful. He returned to Australia in the Anne on 27 February 1810, having as fellow passenger the Rev. Robert Cartwright. He had also enlisted the services of the Rev. William Cowper (q.v.), who arrived about the same time. Soon after Marsden's arrival he unfortunately quarrelled with Governor Macquarie who had recently arrived at Sydney. The governor was anxious to raise the status of convicts who had served their time, and one course he took was the appointing of some of them to the magistracy. Marsden was appointed one of the commissioners of public roads as were also certain of the new magistrates. Marsden considered that to sit with these men would be a \"degradation of his office as senior chaplain\", and asked that he might be allowed to decline the office. Both men were determined and a breach occurred between them that was never healed. However, a very important development in Marsden's work was shortly to begin that made these differences for the time being less important. Some of the South Sea missionaries who had been driven off the islands came to Sydney and were befriended by Marsden before his voyage to England. On the way out he found a young Maori chief called Duaterra on the Anne whom he took to his home at Parramatta. This revived his interest in the Maoris and the establishing of New Zealand missions. On account of the massacre of the crew of the ship Boyd, Macquarie at first would not allow any missionaries to sail for New Zealand. Marsden revived the question in 1814, and having bought a ship, two missionaries, Hall and Kendall, sailed for the Bay of Islands with a message to Duaterra who met them when they arrived. Hall and Kendall returned to Sydney in August, and on 28 November Marsden went to New Zealand to establish the mission permanently. When Marsden arrived he decided that the quarrel which had arisen out of the Boyd massacre, between the people of Whangaroa and those of the Bay of Islands must be brought to an end. Marsden with another of his party, J. L. Nicholas, went to the camp of the Whangaroa natives and spent the night with them. Marsden has recorded that he \"did not sleep much during the night\". Both men were completely at the Maoris' mercy but next day their courage was rewarded. Presents were distributed and the goodwill of the natives was gained. Marsden made six more journeys to New Zealand, and travelled much in the North Island, suffering many hardships, dangers and anxieties, not the least of these arising from the necessity of discharging men who had shown themselves unsuitable for the missionary life. He showed great sympathy with the Maoris and much tolerance and breadth of view. The Maori chiefs admired his courage, and Marsden became an unofficial forerunner for the subsequent taking over of New Zealand by the British.\n\nIn Sydney Marsden's relations with Macquarie continued to be unsatisfactory. He declined reading a general order from the governor in church relating to the settlers bringing grain to the government stores, on the ground that it was irregular and improper to read such orders in churches. Despairing of getting the government to provide proper accommodation for the convicts, and especially the women at Parramatta, he sent a copy of his correspondence with the governor to England. Early in 1818 Marsden resigned from the magistracy, and in the Gazette of 28 March 1818 it was announced that his services were dispensed with. He might have hoped for peace when Brisbane (q.v.) became governor in November 1821, but Marsden was of too independent a cast of mind to be always in agreement with the authorities. He was fined £10 2s. 6d. because he had permitted his convict servant to do some honest work in his leisure hours. He refused to pay and an execution was put in his house; but the indomitable Marsden brought an action against the magistrates in the supreme court for £250 damages. He was awarded £10 2s. 6d., the judge holding that the trespass complained of was committed under an honest mistake of law. Marsden undoubtedly acted under a sense of duty--and in regard to this and other acts of his it must have been gratifying to him to be informed in 1825, that the home authorities having taken into consideration his \"long and useful services in New South Wales\" had increased his salary to £400 a year. In 1826 he published his An Answer to Certain Calumnies in the late Governor Macquarie's Pamphlet and the Third Edition of Mr Wentworth's Account of Australasia, an able defence of his conduct in Australia. Shortly before this he had written to the Rev. J. Pratt of the Church Missionary Society inquiring the amount of the cost of his education by the Elland Society, and stating his intention of forwarding £50 a year until this was paid off. He had his private sorrows, for two sons died in infancy as the result of accidents, and his wife had a long illness before her death in 1835. Marsden, though in ill-health and 73 years of age, made his last visit to New Zealand in 1837 accompanied by his youngest daughter, and was everywhere received with great affection. A certain roughness and bluntness noticeable in his Youth had given way in old age to kindliness and serenity. He died on 12 May 1838 and was buried at Parramatta. A son and five daughters survived him. One of them, Jane, married her cousin Thomas Marsden, and their son, Samuel Edward Marsden (1832-1912), was Bishop of Bathurst, New South Wales, from 1869 to 1885.\n\nJ. R.

His father, J. C. H. Martens, was a German merchant at Hamburg, who settled in England and married an English woman. Little is known of Martens's education and early life, but it is evident that he must have received a good education, and the fact that he chose Copley Fielding, one of the best-known water-colour painters of his day, as his master, suggests that his family was in comfortable circumstances. After his father's death he was painting and living in Devonshire, and sometime later went to South America. In August 1832 the Beagle arrived at Monte Video with Charles Darwin on board, and Martens joined the ship as topographer. That he became friendly with Darwin is evident from a letter quoted in Lionel Lindsay's Conrad Martens, The Man and His Art, forwarding a sketch to Darwin nearly 30 years afterwards.\n\nMartens was two years on the Beagle. Leaving her in September 1834, he stayed for some months at Valparaiso, and then went to Sydney calling at Tahiti and New Zealand on the way. He entered the heads on 17 April 1835. Sydney was then a town of about 20,000 inhabitants and, though some signs of culture were beginning to emerge, it was scarcely a likely place where a man might hope for success as an artist. Martens, however, was fortunate in finding some early patrons, among them being General Sir Edward Macarthur (q.v.), Sir Daniel Cooper (q.v.) and Alexander McLeay (q.v.). In 1837 he married Jane Brackenbury Carter, and was evidently making a living though a precarious one. Afterwards he began drawing lithographic views of Sydney which he coloured by hand and sold for one guinea each. In 1849, when Sydney was passing through a depression, he mentions in a letter that he has no pupils and has been able to sell few pictures. Some years before this he had built a cottage on a piece of land belonging to his wife, on the north side of the harbour. He had a roof over his head and congenial surroundings, and lived there for the remainder of his days. But as the years went by there was no improvement in his sales, it was a period of expansion, people were too busy to be much interested in the arts, and Martens was as lonely a figure in painting as Harpur (q.v.) was in poetry. In 1863 he was glad to accept the position of assistant parliamentary librarian and found the work congenial, though it left him little time for painting. He died on 21 August 1878, and was survived by his wife and two daughters, who subsequently died unmarried.\n\nMartens was essentially a water-colour artist, his oils as a rule are comparatively heavy handed and dull. He was an excellent draughtsman as his many sketches in pencil testify, and to this merit he added good composition and quiet beauty of colour. Many years passed before a water-colourist of equal merit appeared in Australia. He is represented in the Sydney, Melbourne, Adelaide, Hobart, and Brisbane galleries, there is a fine collection at the Mitchell library, and there are also examples at the Commonwealth national library, Canberra. His portrait by Dr Maurice Felton is at the Mitchell library, and a self-portrait in oils was in 1920 in the possession of Miss Coombes of Fonthill.\n\nLionel Lindsay, Conrad Martens the Man and his Art; W.

He was brought by his parents to Australia and arrived in Melbourne in December 1852. Educated at St Mark's school, Fitzroy, he entered the Victorian civil service but early began writing. He was editor of the Melbourne Review, founded in January 1876, until he went to England in 1882. He published in 1876 Sweet Girl Graduate, a novelette with a few short poems added, and in 1878 appeared Lays of To-day; Verses in Jest and Earnest. Some of the poems in this volume were included in Fernshawe; Sketches in Prose and Verse, mostly a collection of essays and verses from the Melbourne Review and other journals, published in 1882. Going to London in this year Martin led a busy journalistic life. In 1889 Australia and the Empire was published, and in 1893 his Life and Letters of Viscount Sherbrooke, a conscientious and interesting piece of work. In the same year appeared True Stories from Australasian History, and two years later The Withered Jester and Other Verses. He published nothing else of any importance and died on 15 February 1902. He married in 1886, Harriet Anne, daughter of Dr J. M. Cookesley.\n\nMartin was a competent journalist of some influence in the early literary life of Melbourne. No other similar journal has had so long a life as the Melbourne Review, a most creditable effort considering the difficulties with which it had to contend.\n\n11, Mennell, The Dictionary of Australasian Biography; E.

Her father, whose name was Mackay, brought her to South Australia when a child, and in 1874 she was living at Mount Gambier. In that year she published at Melbourne a volume of poems The Explorers and other Poems, by M. C., the verse of a well-educated woman, though seldom or never rising into poetry. She came to Adelaide and did journalistic work, including a serial story, Bohemian Born. For a period she was a clerk in the education department. In 1890 she published anonymously An Australian Girl, a novel which was favourably reviewed and in 1891 went into a second edition. This was followed in 1892 by The Silent Sea, published under the pseudonym of \"Mrs Alick MacLeod\". In 1906 appeared The Old Roof Tree: Letters of Isbel to her Half-brother, a series of essays in letter-form. Some are supposed to be written from London, others from a cathedral town, while others describe a tour on the continent. In 1923 appeared The Incredible Journey, the story of an aboriginal woman's journey across desert country to recover her son. Mrs Martin died at Adelaide on 15 March 1937 in her ninetieth year. She married Frederick Martin who predeceased her.\n\nMrs Martin was never as well known as she deserved to be, partly because her work was always published anonymously or under a pseudonym. An Australian Girl is an interesting book written by a woman of thoughtful and philosophic mind, and The Incredible Journey, with its sympathetic appreciation of the point of view of the aborigines, is among the best books of its kind in Australian literature.\n\nInformation from H.

His parents emigrated with him to Sydney in 1821, and he was educated under W. T. Cape (q.v.) at the Sydney Academy and Sydney College. On leaving school at 16 years of age he became a reporter, and in 1838 published The Australian Sketch Book, a remarkably well-written series of sketches for a boy who had just completed his eighteenth year. It was dedicated to G. R. Nichols, a well-known barrister of the period, to whom Martin became articled. At the end of his articles he began practising as an attorney but also did much writing for the press, and in his middle twenties was editor and manager of the Atlas for two years. In 1848 he was a candidate for the Durham electorate of the legislative council, but the press was united against him and he found it prudent to withdraw from the election. Later in the same year he was elected for Cook and Westmoreland, but the election was declared void. At the new election he was returned unopposed. He was not a favourite in the house as a young man, his temper was not under perfect control, and his speeches were considered to be flippant and intemperate. He, however, initiated the discussion which led to the establishment of a branch of the royal mint at Sydney. In 1856 he was elected to the first parliament under responsible government, and in August was made attorney-general in the first ministry of Chas. Cowper (q.v.). There was a great outcry from parliament, press and bar, the chief objection being that Martin was not then a barrister, and the government was defeated largely on account of his appointment. However, when Cowper formed his second ministry in 1857 Martin was given the same position and showed himself to be a good administrator. He had in the meantime qualified as a barrister, and it became noticeable that his manner showed more self-control. In November 1858 he resigned his seat in the cabinet finding himself too often at variance with his colleagues.\n\nMartin was out of office for some years. In October 1863 he was asked to form a government but his first ministry did not last long. Faced with a deficit he struck off the vote for immigration, and attempted to bring in a protective tariff. He was defeated in the house, and obtaining a dissolution his party came back from the election greatly reduced in numbers. The Cowper ministry which followed lasted less than a year, and in January 1866 Martin made a coalition with (Sir) Henry Parkes (q.v.) and the ministry then formed lasted nearly three years and passed many important measures. During the visit of Prince Alfred, Martin was knighted. His government resigned in October 1868. He was premier again from December 1870 until May 1872, when he was succeeded by Parkes. In November 1873, on the retirement of Sir Alfred Stephen (q.v.), Martin was given the position of chief justice and filled it admirably, though towards the end of his life his duties were sometimes interrupted by ill health. He died on 4 November 1886. He married in 1853 Miss I. Long who survived him with a large family including six sons.\n\nMartin was a good journalist; vigorous examples of his work will be found in G. B. Barton's Poets and Prose Writers of New South Wales. He was an excellent speaker, though possibly more a debater than an orator. His people were in comparatively humble circumstances, and were unable to do more for him than send him to a good school. Thereafter he fought his own way to practically the most distinguished position in the colony. The fighting qualities that brought him success also brought him enemies in his younger days, but with the years he learned self-control and as an advocate showed great courtesy to his opponents. As chief justice his fine memory, knowledge of principles, lucid arrangements of facts, and a power of dealing with abstruse and difficult matters of law, united with a balanced judicial mind, made him a great chief justice. His wide reading, great conversational gifts and intellectual power, suggested to J. A. Froude that had Martin been \"chief justice of England, he would have passed as among the most distinguished occupants of that high position\".\n\nThe Sydney Morning Herald, 5 and 8 November 1886; The Daily Telegraph, Sydney, 6 and 8 November 1886; Report of the Proceedings attending the Presentation of the Portrait of Sir James Martin, C.

He was born in London on 13 January 1858, his father being then professor of English literature at University College, London. Masson was educated at the Edinburgh Academy and then at the university, where he graduated in arts and science. He studied under Wöhler at Göttingen before obtaining a position with (Sir) William Ramsay at Bristol, with whom he did valuable research work on phosphorus. He returned to Edinburgh university in 1881 with a research scholarship for three years, towards the end of which he obtained his D.Sc. degree. It was during this time that he took part in the founding of the students' representative council and the students' union. His researches at this period included investigations in the preparation of glyceryl trinitrite and its properties, and the composition and properties of nitroglycerine. In 1886 he was appointed professor of chemistry at the university at Melbourne, and he arrived in Australia in October of that year. His inaugural lecture, given on 23 March 1887, on \"The Scope and Aim of Chemical Science\", showed that the university had gained a scientist of distinction, and a lecturer who could make his subject interesting both to students and laymen. Though there were few students in chemistry, the laboratory equipment was inadequate even for them, and one of Masson's first tasks was the preparation of plans for a new laboratory and lecture theatre. There was a steady growth of students and, as the staff was small, Masson was much occupied with teaching work for many years. He contrived, however, to find some time for research, and during his first 20 years at the university contributed important papers to leading scientific journals.\n\nIn 1912 Masson became president of the professorial board, and in that capacity during the next four years undertook much of the work that in a present-day university would be done by a paid vice-chancellor. He also did important scientific work in connexion with the 1914-18 war. In 1915 he was asked by the then prime minister W. M. Hughes to act as chairman of a committee to draw up a scheme for a Commonwealth institute of science and industry, but difficulties arose and it was not until 1920 that the institute was established. In 1926 it became the Council for Scientific and Industrial Research, of which Masson was a member until his death, and which has done invaluable work. Other activities included his participation in the organization of Mawson's expedition to the Antarctic in 1911-14, and his interest in the Australasian Association for the Advancement of Science, of which he was president 1911-13. As chairman of the organizing committee he had much to do with the holding of the British Association meeting in Australia in 1914. When his old friend, Sir William Ramsay, retired from his professorship at University College, London, in 1913, Masson was offered the position, but he had developed so many interests in Australia that he decided to refuse the appointment. Among societies in which he was interested were the Melbourne University Chemical Society, the Society of Chemical Industry of Victoria, both of which he founded, and the Australian Chemical lnstitute of which he was the first president (1917-20). He was associated with Sir Edgeworth David (q.v.) in the founding of the Australian National Research Council, and was its president in 1922-3. At the end of 1923 Masson retired from his chair at Melbourne and became professor emeritus. After his resignation he continued his interest in the progress of chemical science, and sat on several councils and committees. He died at Melbourne on 10 August 1937. He was elected a fellow of the Royal Society, London, in 1903 and was created C.B.E. in 1918 and K.B.E. in 1922. He married in 1886 Mary, daughter of Sir John Struthers, who survived him with a son and a daughter. Lady Masson did valuable work during the 1914-18 war, and was created C.B.E. in 1918. The son, James Irvine Orme Masson, born at Melbourne in 1887, had a distinguished academic career. He became vice-chancellor of the university of Sheffield in 1938, and was elected a fellow of the Royal Society in 1939. He published Three Centuries of Chemistry in 1925. A daughter, Flora Marjorie, now Mrs W. E. Bassett, published in 1940, The Governor's Lady, and another daughter, Elsie Rosaline, who married the distinguished anthropologist, Bronislaw Malinowski, and died in 1935, was also a writer; she published An Untamed Territory in 1915.\n\nTall, strong and handsome, with much charm of manner, Masson had also wisdom and natural dignity. His wit was unforced and he could even dignify a pun. When after the conscription referendum in 1917 someone said \"I am disappointed. I thought the people's horse sense would have guided them\". \"Horse sense,\" said Masson, \"the only thing horse-like about them was that they said nay.\" This was one of his lighter moments in a career of hard work. He was admirable as a chairman of committees and was a great administrator, with ideals of service, and an inspiring teacher with a gift of lucid exposition. He did brilliant work as a researcher showing great originality and foresight in a long series of papers, and he was a leader in everything relating to science both at the university of Melbourne, and in the wider field of Australia. Among his students were (Sir) David Rivett who succeeded him in his chair, and E. J. Hartung who followed Rivett. Bertram Dillon Steele (q.v.) was also one of his students.\n\nA. C. D.

He studied at Edinburgh and came to Victoria in 1878. For some time he made a living as a house decorator, and in 1880 was partly responsible for the decoration of the dome of the exhibition building at Melbourne. At his week ends he painted landscapes both in oil and water-colour, and finding that these were becoming popular was able to give the whole of his time to art. He became well-known as a teacher and many of the artists working at this period in water-colour were his pupils. He exhibited at the Victorian Academy of arts, was an original member of the Australian Artists' Association founded in 1886, and when the two societies were amalgamated under the name of the Victorian Artists' Society he took a leading part in its administration. He was many times president during the next 20 years, and showed himself to be an excellent leader. In 1892 he was appointed a trustee of the public library, museums and national gallery of Victoria. He was a good man of business and this with his knowledge of art made him a very valuable committee member. In 1905 he was appointed to the Felton bequests committee. He died on 18 February 1916. He married in 1883 Jessie Pines Best who survived him with two sons and a daughter.\n\nMather was a slightly saturnine looking man, but he was not unkindly, and took a genuine interest in the art of Australia. His early experiments in etching were not very successful, and his work in oils is as a rule somewhat hard and tight. \"Autumn in the Fitzroy Gardens\" at Melbourne is a favourable example of him in this medium. His water-colours were often excellent and he attained great facility as a sketcher. In his later years he sometimes worked too long on his watercolours and spoiled them by getting a woolly effect. He is represented in the galleries at Melbourne, Sydney, Perth, Ballarat, Geelong, Castlemaine and Launceston.

JOHN (1849-1929),\n\nanthropologist,\n\nson of Alexander Mathew, general merchant, was born at Aberdeen, Scotland, in 1849. His father died when he was nine years old, and Mathew then went to live with his maternal grandmother at Insch and was educated at the church school there. In 1862, or a little later, he went to Queensland to live with his mother's brother, John Mortimer, on his station in the Burnett River district. His uncle, who had a good library, encouraged the boy to study, and between 1865 and 1872 Mathew was much interested in the aborigines of the Kabi and Wakka tribes whose country was close by. About 1872 he became a teacher in the Queensland education department, and in 1876 he came to Melbourne and qualified for matriculation at the university. He was, however, unable to enter on his arts course, and for some time acted as a tutor and later as a station manager. He was successful in this work, but he had long intended to enter the ministry, about 1883 began his arts course at the university, and in 1885 qualified for the B.A. and M.A. degrees with a first class, and the final honours scholarship in mental and moral philosophy. He later obtained by examination the degree of bachelor of divinity of St Andrews university. In 1889 he was ordained in the Presbyterian Church and was given his first charge at Ballan, Victoria. In the same year he was awarded a medal and prize by the Royal Society of New South Wales for an essay on the Australian aborigines. This essay was developed into Mathew's most important book, Eaglehawk and Crow a Study of the Australian Aborigines, which was published in London in 1899. Mathew was only a few months in Ballan before being called to Coburg, a suburb of Melbourne, where he had a successful ministry for 33 years. He was also chairman of the council of his old college, Ormond College, from 1910 to 1927, and was elected moderator for Victoria in 1911, and moderator general of the Presbyterian Church of Australia in 1922. He retired from his parish in that year and in 1924 the Melbourne College of Divinity gave him the degree of D.D. for his manuscript translation of the Sinaitic Syriac gospels. He took much interest in the College of Divinity and in educational matters of all kinds. He died at Melbourne on 11 March 1929. He married Wilhelmina, daughter of Mungo Scott, who survived him with four sons and one daughter.\n\nMathew published three volumes of verse Australian Echoes, 1902; Napoleon's Tomb, 1911; and Ballads of Bush Life and Lyrics of Cheer, 1914. His Poems do not profess to be more than simple popular verse. His really important work was in Eaglehawk and Crow, a good book of its period which may still be referred to. His Two Representative Tribes of Queensland, published in 1910, also retains its value as the work of a man who had made a close study of the origins, languages and social customs of a primitive people.\n\nR.

The name is unusual, and it has been suggested that he may have belonged to the same family as General Matra who is mentioned in Boswell's An Account of Corsica. He was a midshipman on H.M.S. Endeavour with Cook (q.v.) in 1770 under the name of J. Magra, and may have landed with Banks (q.v.) and Solander (q.v.) at Botany Bay. In December 1772 he was British consul at Teneriffe, and between 1774 and 1779, his father having died, he made various efforts to get to New York to look after his estate, and failing to obtain a \"share of the allowance granted for the Loyal Americans\", was endeavouring in February 1783 to obtain an appointment to one of the Spanish \"consulages\". On 28 July 1783 he wrote to Banks stating that he had heard rumours of two plans for settlements in the South Seas, one of them in New South Wales, and asking for information about them, as he had \"frequently revolved similar plans in my mind\". Matra probably conferred with Banks and promptly brought forward a plan, dated 23 August 1783, for a settlement in New South Wales and suggested it could form an asylum for the unfortunate American loyalists. His primary idea was a settlement of free men, but in a postscript he discussed the question of transportation. Matra may have been hoping that if the plan were adopted he would be given an official position in connexion with it. In 1787, however, he was appointed consul-general at Tangiers, and during his term he twice conducted negotiations with the Sultan of Morocco for which he received the thanks of the government. He died at Tangiers on 29 March 1806.\n\nIn 1914 Captain J. H. Watson contributed a paper to the Royal Australian Historical Society at Sydney, in which he claimed that Matra was the \"Father of Australia\". This, however, is claiming too much. In 1779 a committee of the house of commons was inquiring into the question of transportation, and when Banks was examined as a witness he stated that Botany Bay appeared to him to be the most eligible for such a settlement. It is clear from Matra's letter to Banks in 1783, already quoted, that the question was still being kept alive, and the chief merit of Matra's suggestion was his belief that a settlement for free men might be possible. It would certainly have been better if practical farmers had first been sent out as he suggested, instead of the unfortunate convicts that Phillip (q.v.) had to look after, but the fact remains that Matra's plan was not adopted.\n\nJ.

His parents, who came from Guernsey, Channel Islands, had arrived in Victoria not long before. Mauger was educated at the Geelong national school, and coming to Melbourne was apprenticed to a hat-manufacturing business of which he subsequently became the proprietor. He joined the Fitzroy Temperance Fire Brigade, at a meeting held on 24 May 1883 was elected honorary secretary of a committee of representatives of the volunteer fire brigades of Victoria, and, with Captain Marshall, the chairman, prepared a draft of a fire brigades bill which, however, did not become law until 1891, when the old volunteer system was superseded. Mauger was appointed a government representative on the new board and held this position for the remainder of his life, on four occasions being elected president. But this represented only one part of Mauger's activities. In 1880 he was responsible for the formation of the National anti-sweating league of Victoria, of which he became the honorary secretary. In 1885 Deakin (q.v.) sueceeded in having a factory act passed but sweating still continued, and, after years of agitation, a new act was passed in 1896 which led to much subsequent important social legislation in Australia.\n\nMauger also was prominent in the demand for federation and often spoke in its favour. He was elected as member for Footscray in the Victorian legislative assembly in 1899, in 1901 entered the federal house of representatives as member for Melbourne Ports, and transferred to the new division of Maribyrnong in 1906. He was temporary chairman of committees in 1905-6, honorary minister in the second Deakin (q.v.) cabinet from October 1906 to July 1907, and postmaster-general from July 1907 to November 1908. He lost his seat at the general election held in 1910 and took no further part in politics. He was an ardent protectionist and was for some time honorary secretary of the protectionists' association of Victoria; he was for a time president of the Melbourne Total Abstinence Society, and chairman of the Indeterminate Sentences Board; and he presumably found some time for his business as a hatter and mercer. For about 50 years in every movement in Melbourne intended to better the conditions of the mass of the people, Mauger was to be found working incessantly and showing much organizing ability. In 1934 he wrote a brochure on The Rise and Progress of the Metropolitan Fire Brigade, Victoria, Australia, and some verses quoted on page 29 relating to the success of the staff fund illustrate his philosophy of life. Briefly it was that if anything is brought forward for the good of humanity, the difficulties will vanish if the problem is tackled with sufficient courage. Mauger died at Melbourne on 26 June 1936. He married a daughter of A. Rice who survived him with two sons and four daughters.\n\nThe Age and The Argus, Melbourne, 27 June 1936; The Cyclopedia of Victoria, 1903; Commonwealth Parliamentary Handbook, 1901-30.\n\n^Top of page\n\nMAURICE, FURNLEY,\n\nSee WILMOT, FRANK LESLIE THOMSON.\n\n^Top of page\n\nMAY, PHILIP WILLIAM, (1864-1903), always known as Phil May,\n\ncaricaturist,\n\nthe son of Philip May, was born at Wortley near Leeds on 22 April 1864. His grandfather, a country gentleman of means, had some talent as a draughtsman and was fond of making caricatures. He was friendly with George Stephenson, the well-known engineer, and apprenticed his son, Philip, to him. Later on Philip May went into business as a brass founder with little success, and died when his son Phil May was nine years old. His widow, who came of good Irish stock, was the daughter of Eugene Macarthy at one time manager of Drury Lane Theatre. She was left in very poor circumstances and the family had a great struggle to exist. Phil May had little schooling, became office boy in a solicitor's office when 12 years old, and had a variety of occupations until he joined a theatrical company, playing small parts and doing sketches for the show bills. He had always been fond of drawing and when only 14 years old had drawings accepted for the Yorkshire Gossip. In 1883 he found his way to London, went through many hardships, and though he had a few sketches accepted, had to return to Leeds in 1884 in bad health. At the end of that year he did a remarkable page of caricatures of well-known personages for the Christmas number of Society, and in the spring of 1885 he obtained a place on the staff of the St Stephen's Review. He was doing well enough to be able to decline an offer of £15 a week made by W. H. Traill (q.v.), manager of the Sydney Bulletin. The offer was raised to £20 a week, and May, realizing that the climate would be good for his health, accepted it and sailed for Australia at the end of 1885.\n\nIt has often been said that the mechanical weaknesses of the Bulletin printing press led to May's economy of line, but a glance at May's earlier work will show that that is not quite the whole truth. However, the variety and mass of May's work in the Bulletin, he did about 800 drawings during the less than three years that he was on the staff, no doubt gave him great practice in eliminating the unnecessary. It was a wonderful opportunity for a young man of 21, and though in later years May's work may have gained in refinement, it is doubtful whether it ever became more vigorous or more truly comic. After leaving the Bulletin he stayed for a little while in Melbourne but left Australia about the end of 1888. He lived for some time in Rome and Paris with the intention of studying painting, but returned to London about 1890. He continued to send occasional sketches to the Bulletin until 1894, and in London his work was appearing in the St Stephen's Review, the Graphic, Pick-me-up, and in 1893, Punch. His drawings for The Parson and the Painter, which had appeared in the St Stephen's Review, were published in book form in 1891, and in 1892 Phil May's Summer Annual and Phil May's Winter Annual first appeared. Fifteen of these annuals were eventually published, full of excellent drawings from May's pen. In 1896 he became a regular member of the staff of Punch and so remained until his death. He still continued to contribute to other periodicals such as the Sketch and the Graphic, and towards the end of his life did some beautiful work in pencil, lightly coloured. He died after a long illness on 5 August 1903. He had married at the age of 21 a young widow of great charm and personality, Mrs Charles Farrer, who survived him without issue.\n\nPhil May was slightly above medium height, gaunt, with a profile reminiscent of that of Pope Leo XIII. A born story-teller with an unfailing sense of humour, he was the typical good companion, beloved by hosts of friends and sponged upon by troops of parasites. All the efforts of his best friends and his loyal wife could not prevent him from being continually fleeced and imposed upon. May could never forget he had been once near starvation himself, and his purse was open for all in need. He drank too much for his own good in his later years, but, however careless he may have been about his health, he was never careless in his drawing, and at his death was recognized as one of the great masters of line drawing. Examples of his work will be found at the leading Australian galleries, the Victoria and Albert Museum, and the British Museum. In addition to his Summer and Winter Annuals various collections were published, including Phil May's Sketch Book (1895), Phil May's Guttersnipes (1896), Phil May's Graphic Pictures and Phil May's A. B. C. (1897), Phil May's Album (1899), Phil May, Sketches from Punch (1903). Publications after his death included Phil May in Australia (1904), The Phil May Folio (1904), and Humorists of the Pencil, Phil May (1908).\n\nA. G.

Two months later he became an assistant to Charles Grimes (q.v.), the surveyor-general, and went with him to explore the Hunter River in 1801. He was also with Grimes on the expedition to explore King Island and Port Phillip in 1802 and 1803. Grimes had leave of absence from August 1803 to go to England, and during his absence for about three years, Meehan did much of his work with the title of assistant-surveyor. In October 1805 Governor King (q.v.) directed him to trace the course of the Nepean to the southward a little beyond Mount Taurus, and in October 1807 Meehan prepared his interesting plan of Sydney, a copy of which will be found opposite page 366 in volume VI of the Historical Records of New South Wales. In 1812 Governor Macquarie (q.v.) sent him to Tasmania with instructions to remeasure the whole of the farms granted by former governors and himself. He accompanied Hamilton Hume (q.v.) in some explorations in southern New South Wales in 1816, when Lake George was discovered, and in 1818 Meehan was appointed deputy surveyor-general. He endeavoured in this year without success to find a practicable road over the Shoalhaven River so that communication might be opened up with Jervis Bay, but continuing his efforts early in 1820 he went through some very difficult country after crossing the river from the east, and then connecting with his 1818 track. In 1822 he resigned his position and was granted a pension of £100 a year in 1823. He died on 21 April 1826. He was a most capable and industrious official, and though he does not rank among the leading explorers, he did some very valuable work while carrying out his duties during the first 20 years of the nineteenth century.\n\nHistorical Records of Australia, ser.

He was educated at a private school under the Rev. Mr Garrett, and did a little work at the school of design, Adelaide. Practically his art training did not begin until he arrived in London in 1878 and began to study at South Kensington. He took up etching, exhibited two dry-points at the Royal Academy exhibition in 1880, and during the next 20 years showed about 35 of his etchings and paintings at the Academy. He was war artist for Black and White in South Africa in 1900. In 1901 he published War Impressions, the first of a series of books illustrated in colour from his sketches with, in most cases, the text written by his daughter, Dorothy Menpes. The series included Japan (1902), World Pictures (1902), The Durbar (1903), World's Children (1903), Venice (1904), India (1905), Brittany (1905), The Thames (1906), Paris (1907), China (1909), The People of India (1910). He wrote and published in 1904 Whistler as I Knew Him, a lively and interesting account of his association with Whistler as pupil and friend. The book was profusely illustrated with reproductions of Whistler's work. He also wrote three little biographies, of Henry Irving (1906), Lord Kitchener (1915), and Lord Roberts (1915). Each of these contains excellent portrait studies by Menpes. During the first few years after 1900 he was much interested in colour reproduction and published a large number of very good reproductions of paintings by the Old Masters, suitable for training. About 1907 the Menpes Fruit Farm Company was established at Pangbourne and he lived there until his death on 1 April 1938. He married about 1880 Rose Grosse who died in 1936. Two daughters are mentioned in connexion with his publications.\n\nMenpes had a dislike of the conventional, was a good raconteur, and was well known as a personality in London. Though his many one man shows were often successful, he did not attain to anything like the front rank as either a painter or an etcher. He could, however, do a swift and characteristic sketch, and much of his illustrative work is good.\n\nThe Times, 5 April 1938; The Advertiser, Adelaide, 5 April 1938; A.

His father, George Meredith, was born about 1778, saw service in the royal marines during the Napoleonic wars, and when no longer a young man decided to go to Tasmania. He arrived at Hobart with his wife and family on 13 March 1821 and became one of the best known of the early pioneers. He took a great interest in the development of the colony and had a leading part in the movements for separation from New South Wales, anti-transportation, and representative government. He died in 1856 in his seventy-ninth year. His son Charles assisted him in farming in Tasmania for some time, went to New South Wales in 1834, and took up land on the Murrumbidgee. He visited England in 1838 and on 18 April 1839 married his cousin, Louisa Anne Twamley (see Meredith, Louisa Anne). On his return to Australia he was two years in New South Wales, but it was a depressed period and he made heavy losses. He went to Tasmania, and in 1843 was appointed a police magistrate at Sorell in the north-east of the island. He became a member of the original legislative council and was elected for Glamorgan in the first house of assembly in 1856. He was colonial treasurer in the Gregson (q.v.) ministry for two months in 1857, and held the same position in the James Whyte (q.v.) ministry from January 1863 to November 1866. He held the lands and works portfolios in the F. M. Innes (q.v.) cabinet from November 1872 to August 1873, and was again colonial treasurer in the T. Reibey (q.v.) ministry from July 1876 to August 1877. He was in parliament for nearly 24 years and was a member of the executive council for 17 years. He resigned his seat on account of ill-health in 1879, and died at Launceston, Tasmania, on 2 March 1880. His wife and children survived him.\n\nMeredith was a good administrator who was held in great respect by his fellow colonists. He was one of the few Tasmanians whose name has been publicly commemorated; a fountain in his memory was erected in the Queen's domain, Hobart, in 1885.\n\nThe Mercury, Hobart, 4 March 1880; R. W.

She was educated chiefly by her mother, and in 1835 published a volume, Poems, which was favourably reviewed. This was followed in 1836 by The Romance of Nature, mostly in verse, of which a third edition was issued in 1839. Another volume was published in the same year, The Annual of British Landscape Scenery, an account of a tour on the Wye from Chepstow to near its source at Plinlimmon. Shortly afterwards Miss Twamley was married to her cousin, Charles Meredith (q.v.). They sailed for New South Wales in June 1839, and arrived at Sydney on 27 September. After travelling into the interior as far as Bathurst, Mrs Meredith returned to the coast and lived at Homebush for about a year. Towards the end of 1840 Mrs Meredith went to Tasmania, and an interesting account of her first 11 years in Australia is given in her two books, Notes and Sketches of New South Wales (1844), reprinted at least twice, and My Home in Tasmania (1852).\n\nFor some years Mrs Meredith lived in the country. In 1860 she published Some of My Bush Friends in Tasmania. The illustrations were drawn by herself, and simple descriptions of characteristic native flowers were given. In the following year an account of a visit to Victoria, Over the Straits, was published, and in 1880 Tasmanian Friends and Foes, Feathered, Furred and Finned. This went into a second edition in 1881. In 1891, in her eightieth year, Mrs Meredith went to London to supervise the publication of Last Series, Bush Friends in Tasmania. She died at Melbourne on 21 October 1895 and was survived by children. Other publications by her are listed in Serle's Bibliography of Australasian Poetry and Verse, and Miller's Australian Literature. Mrs Meredith was the author of two novels, Phoebe's Mother (1869), which had appeared in the Australasian in 1866 under the title of Ebba, and Nellie, or Seeking Goodly Pearls (1882). Mrs Meredith took great interest in politics and frequently wrote unsigned articles for the Tasmanian press. This was no new thing for her as in her youth she had written articles in support of the Chartists. When she visited Sydney in 1882, Sir Henry Parkes told her that he had read and appreciated her articles when a youth. After her husband's death she was granted a pension of £100 a year by the Tasmanian government.\n\nMrs Meredith was tall and of commanding presence. Her poetry is no more than pleasant verse, but she had a true feeling for natural history and was a capable artist. Many of her books were illustrated by herself. Her volumes on New South Wales, Tasmania, and Victoria in the 1840s and 50s, will always retain their value as first hand records.\n\nMiss M.

Michael afterwards told his friend Joseph Sheridan Moore, that the passage on page 12 of John Cumberland, beginning \"My earliest memory\", gives an exact picture of his childhood. He was articled to his father and began to mix in artistic and literary circles. Sheridan Moore states that Michael became friendly with Millais and Ruskin, and published a pamphlet which made some stir at the time, vindicating the position of the pre-Raphaelite brotherhood. Moore also says that though \"always temperate and abstemious in his habits he had a talent for frittering away his money\". This may possibly have been one of the reasons for his coming to Australia.\n\nMichael arrived in New South Wales towards the end of 1853 and practised his profession with some success. He became friendly with Sheridan Moore who introduced him to Kendall, whom he afterwards took into his office and \"treated as an affectionate elder brother would a younger one\". In 1857 he published Songs without Music, a volume of lyrics, and in 1860 John Cumberland, a long poem largely autobiographical. In the same year he removed to Grafton on the Clarence River and for a time practised successfully; but towards the end of his life he appears to have made enemies and was in money difficulties. On the evening of Sunday 26 April 1868 he went for a walk and two days later his body was found floating in the river. The medical evidence stated that there was a deep cut over the right eye \"such as might be produced by falling on a broken bottle\". The coroner's jury returned an open verdict, and although a set of verses Michael had written a few weeks before suggested to some people that he had contemplated suicide, the possibility of this was indignantly denied by his friend, Sheridan Moore, who declared that the evidence suggested either foul play or accident, rather than suicide. Michael married in 1854 and was survived by a son.\n\nMichael wrote musical verse, some of which has been included in Australian anthologies. His long poem, John Cumberland, contains some good passages, but is marred by many patches of prose. Though distinctly a minor Australian poet Michael's encouragement of the young Kendall gives him a special interest. His friends were agreed about the charm of his conversation and personality.\n\nJ.

Educated at first at Maldon, he went to Wesley College, Melbourne, in 1877, where he won the Draper and Walter Powell scholarships. In 1881 he began the arts course at the university of Melbourne, and qualified for the B.A. degree at the end of 1883. He had a brilliant course, heading the list with first-class honours each year, and winning the final honour scholarship in mathematics and physics. He then went to Cambridge, obtained a major scholarship at Trinity College, and was bracketed senior wrangler in the first part of the mathematical tripos in 1887. In the second part of the tripos in 1888, Michell was placed in division one of the first class. He was elected a fellow of Trinity in 1890, but returned to Melbourne in the same year, and was appointed lecturer in mathematics at the university. He held this position for over 30 years. His academic work occupied so much of his time that it was difficult to do original research. The first of his papers, \"On the theory of free streamlines\", which appeared in Transactions of the Royal Society in 1890, had drawn attention to his ability as a mathematician, and during the following 12 years about 15 papers were contributed to English mathematical journals. It was recognized that these were important contributions to the knowledge of hydrodynamics and elasticity, and in 1902 he was elected a fellow of the Royal Society, London. The number of his students at the university was steadily increasing, but there was no corresponding increase in the staff for a long period. Michell continued his research work but none of it was published. In 1923 he became professor of mathematics and, obtaining some increase of staff, established practice-classes and tutorials, thus considerably improving the efficiency of his department. He resigned the chair at the end of 1928 and was given the title of honorary research professor. He died after a short illness on 3 February 1940. He never married. He published in 1937 The Elements of Mathematical Analysis, a substantial work in two volumes written in collaboration with M. H. Belz.\n\nMichell, a shy and retiring man, was one of the earliest graduates of an Australian university to be elected to the Royal Society. He was a good teacher, modest, good-natured and thoroughly painstaking with students, but his heart was really in his research work. His assistance was freely given to his engineering friends in clearing up their problems, and he did a good deal of physical experimentation including the devising and construction of several new forms of gyroscopes. He was continually at work, and it is not known why he did not choose to publish any papers after 1902. The value of his paper on \"The wave resistance of a ship\", published in 1898, was not realized until some 30 years later, when both English and German designers began to recognize its importance. A brother, Anthony George Maldon Michell, born in 1870, educated at Cambridge and at Melbourne university, made remarkable contributions to mechanical science, including the famous Michell thrust bearing. He was elected a fellow of the Royal Society, London, in 1934 and was awarded the James Watt International medal in 1942.\n\nObituary Notices of the Royal Society, London, 1940, with portrait, appreciations, and list of his papers; The Age, Melbourne, 5 February 1940; E.

He was educated at Westminster School, entered at the Middle Temple in 1834, and was called to the bar in 1838. He emigrated to Sydney in 1839, practised his profession and also took up journalistic work; he was associated with (Sir) James Martin (q.v.) and Robert Lowe (q.v.) on the Atlas when it was founded in 1844. About the year 1848 he returned to England, but came to Australia again in 1852 and began to practise at Melbourne. He was nominated a member of the Victorian legislative council in the same year but resigned a few months later. He became proprietor of the Melbourne Herald, then a morning paper, in 1854, but made losses and retired from it two years later. At the first election under the new constitution, held in 1856, Michie was elected one of the members for Melbourne in the legislative assembly, and in April 1857 became attorney-general in the second Haines (q.v.) ministry. He was minister of justice in the first McCulloch (q.v.) ministry from July 1863 to July 1866 and attorney-general in the third Mcculloch ministry from April 1870 to June 1871. He was then defeated at an election for the legislative assembly, and entered the legislative council, resigning soon afterwards to pay a visit to Europe in 1872. Returning in 1873 he was appointed agent-general for Victoria in London and held this position for six years. He then returned to Melbourne and practised as a barrister. In his old age he fell into ill health and for several years was confined to his house. He died at Melbourne on 21 June 1899. He married in 1840 Mary, daughter of Dr John Richardson, who survived him with three sons and two daughters. He was created K.C.M.G. in 1878.\n\nMichie was a widely-read and brilliant man with a keen sense of humour and a fund of anecdotes. He was one of the barristers who so successfully defended the leaders of the diggers after the Eureka rebellion, and in parliament was a good administrator whose influence in the house was important, even when not in office. He was well-qualified as a writer but his only published work was Readings in Melbourne, published in 1879, which reprinted three public lectures and a long essay on the resources and prospects of Victoria.\n\nThe Argus, Melbourne, 23 June 1899; The Times, 23 June 1899: P.

His father, Samuel King Miller, a man of much foresight, was head teacher of the Deniliquin public school, where the boy completed his education. He entered the service of the Bank of New South Wales at Deniliquin in 1876, and six years later was transferred at his own request to the head office at Sydney. Showing great attention to his work Miller became accountant in 1896, and four years later, assistant to the general manager. In 1909 he was appointed metropolitan inspector. In 1911 the federal Labour party decided to bring in a bill to establish a national bank, and Miller was summoned to Melbourne to see the prime minister, Andrew Fisher (q.v.). The bill was discussed and Miller was asked to become the first governor. The appointment was something of a surprise, but no doubt discreet inquiries had been made which satisfied Fisher that Miller was a man with the knowledge, courage and caution, required for the office. His appointment was dated 1 June 1912, and in July the bank's business was started in a small room in Collins-street, Melbourne, the staff consisting of Miller, and a messenger lent by the department of the treasury. The sole capital was £10,000 advanced by the government. The first step was the establishment of a savings bank department, which was followed by the opening of the general banking department on 20 January 1913. On the opening day over £2,000,000 was received in deposits, the greater part being Commonwealth government accounts. Miller began his work with great soundness and caution, it was essential that the public should have complete faith in the new venture, and nothing was to be gained by entering into any kind of competition with the established banks which might be considered unfair. For the first 12 months progress was comparatively slow though steady, but the bank soon began to expand, and when the war came in August 1914 it was in a position to do most important work. In the uncertain early days of the war it made advances to the government, and it took complete charge of the issue of war loans in Australia. Before the war had ended £190,000,000 had been subscribed. The government took control of the primary products of Australia, and the control of the issuing of new capital by public companies. In the transactions which consequently arose Miller's advice and the resources of the bank were always at the service of the various governments, and were sources of great strength to them. By the end of the war the bank was firmly established, with its head office at Sydney, about 40 branches, and 2758 agencies and receiving offices in Australia, the islands, and London.\n\nAfter the war the bank was able to be of great use in connexion with repatriation, and in 1920 it was given control of the Australian note issue. Miller had great powers which he used wisely, and was an indefatigable worker until his unexpected death at Sydney on 6 June 1923. He married in 1895 Laura Constance, daughter of Dr J. T. Heeley, who survived him with four sons and two daughters. He was created K.C.M.G. in 1920. A Denison Miller memorial scholarship was founded in his memory at the university of Sydney. He was interested in various charities, and was a founder and for some time honorary treasurer of the New South Wales Institute of Bankers. He advocated a strong immigration policy after the war, and had great confidence in the future of Australia in spite of the war debt. The Commonwealth Bank was his life work, his control of it was absolute, and he had a faculty for getting good assistants. Since his death profits from the note issue have brought large sums to the consolidated revenue every year, and the combined capital and reserves of the bank in 1940 were approaching £10,000,000, all built up out of profits. It was fortunate for Australia that a man so sane, shrewd, and hardworking should have laid its foundations.\n\nThe Sydney Morning Herald, 7 and 8 June 1923; The Argus, Melbourne, 7 June 1923; The Australian Insurance and Banking Record, 21 June 1923, 21 October 1940; Article by Miller reprinted from the Bankers Magazine, New York, 1918; Vance Palmer, National Portraits.\n\n^Top of page\n\nMILLER, WILLIAM (1847-1939),\n\nwrestler and all-round athlete,\n\nwas born in Cheshire, England, of partly French parentage, in 1847. He came to Melbourne at four years of age, and was employed in the Victorian post office and railway departments before becoming a professional athlete. He made a great reputation as a wrestler, especially in the Graeco-Roman style, of which he was the Australian champion. He was a great weight-lifter, a champion fencer, and a remarkable walker; he is stated to have walked 102 miles in 24 hours when he was well past 50 years of age. He had little opportunity to show his skill as a boxer because prize-fighting was illegal, but on 26 May 1883 it was arranged that L. Foley and Miller should give a \"scientific display\" of boxing at Sydney for a trophy valued at £500. Foley was several stone lighter than his opponent, but it was believed that his science and agility would give him the advantage. He, however, never had a chance from the beginning, and was so severely battered that the rougher elements in the audience rushed the ring and the contest was declared a draw. Miller really had won so easily that it appears likely that no man of that period could have stood up to him. He was 5 feet 9½ inches in height, 48 inches round the chest, and weighed 15 stone, \"a model of a perfect Hercules\" (The Bulletin, 2 June 1883). Nearly 50 years later W. J. Doherty, in his In the Days of the Giants, described Miller as \"one of the greatest all-round athletes the world has seen\". Miller was in the United States in 1889 and though 42 years of age, issued a challenge to meet any two athletes at boxing, Graeco-Roman wrestling, heavy dumbbell lifting, foil and singlestick fencing, the winner of the most exercises to be declared the winner of the match. He also challenged Joe McAuliffe, champion heavyweight boxer of the Pacific Slope and the Western States, to a six-round contest with ordinary boxing gloves. Neither challenge was taken up, and Miller returned to Australia and carried on his gymnasium and boxing classes for some years. In 1903 he left Australia for the United States and became manager of the San Francisco Athletic Club. He was afterwards athletic instructor in the New York police department. From 1917 he lived at Baltimore and he died there on 11 March 1939, aged 92. He married in 1872 Lizzie Trible who died in 1929. He had no children.\n\nMiller was one of the most kind-hearted of men, gentle in speech, dignified in manner, a perfect sportsman, an example to all connected with every form of sport.\n\nThe Bulletin, 17 February 1937, 26 April 1939; The New York Times, 13 March 1939; personal knowledge.\n\n^Top of page\n\nMILNE, SIR WILLIAM (1822-1895),\n\npolitician,\n\nwas the son of William Milne, a merchant, and his wife, Elizabeth McMillan.
