        "text": "Penny Mordaunt, who long harboured ambitions to become the leader of the Conservative Party, had her breakthrough moment into the public consciousness at the King’s coronation last year.\n\nThe former leader of the Commons, who has lost her Portsmouth North seat in the general election, went viral on social media after her starring role in the ceremony, carrying the 3.6kg 17th century Sword of State in front of King Charles, and a worldwide audience of hundreds of millions, for nearly an hour.\n\nIn her concession speech, she said: “Tonight, the Conservative Party has taken a battering because it’s failed to honor the trust that people have placed in it.\n\n“You can speak all you like, have security and freedom. But you can’t have either if you are afraid – afraid about the cost of living or accessing health care, or whether the responsibility you shoulder will be recognised and rewarded.\n\n“That fear steals the future and it only makes the present matter. And that is why we lost.\n\n“Our renewal as a party in a country will not be achieved by us talking to an ever smaller slice of ourselves, but by being guided by the people of this country. And if we want again, to be the natural party of government, then our values must be the people’s.”\n\nMs Mordaunt was given the job of Commons leader by Liz Truss when she was prime minister in September 2022, in what was widely regarded as an attempt by the then-PM to sideline her former leadership rival, even though the MP had backed her halfway through the contest.\n\nBut it had the opposite effect. Two days later, Queen Elizabeth II died, and Ms Mordaunt, who also had the role of Lord President of the Privy Council, took centre stage in the accession to the throne of King Charles III.\n\nDays after the Queen’s death, in a ceremony at St James’s Palace, she became the first woman in British history to proclaim a new monarch.\n\nHer sword-carrying performance during the coronation seven months later, sparked fresh speculation over whether she could become the next Conservative leader, after she withdrew from the contest with Rishi Sunak to succeed Ms Truss.\n\nRumours about her leadership ambitions continued to swirl since then. In March, Tory MPs were briefing that Ms Mordaunt, who is popular with grassroots Tories, was being lined up to replace Mr Sunak as a potential unity candidate – but sources close to her dismissed the claims as “nonsense”.\n\nMs Mordaunt first ran for Tory leader in the summer 2022 contest after Boris Johnson resigned as PM, coming third behind Liz Truss and Mr Sunak. She considered standing again following Ms Truss’s resignation in October, but in the end Mr Sunak was unopposed after Ms Mordaunt pulled out of the race.\n\nShe also served in the Cabinet under Theresa May and Boris Johnson, leading the government’s response to the Oxfam charity misconduct scandal in 2018 as international development secretary.\n\nAfter taking up the equalities brief, Ms Mordaunt became the first minister to use sign language in the Commons, and the following year earned a promotion to defence secretary, only to be sacked when Mr Johnson took over from Mrs May amid the Brexit wars.\n\nMr Johnson brought her back into the Cabinet in the 2020 reshuffle, becoming paymaster general and playing a crucial role briefing MPs about the government’s response to the Covid pandemic.\n\nMs Mordaunt served as Commons leader from September 2022, winning plaudits from Tory MPs for her weekly attacks on Labour while setting out the forthcoming business of the House.\n\nBorn in Torquay in March 1973, Ms Mordaunt says she was named after the Navy cruiser HMS Penelope and her father John served in the Parachute Regiment before retraining as a teacher and youth worker. Her mother Jennifer worked as a special educational needs teacher. She died of breast cancer when Ms Mordaunt, who has two brothers, was 15.\n\nAfter leaving home, a gap year in Romania in which she worked in orphanges and hospitals after the 1989 revolution toppled the communist regime of Nicolae Ceausescu, triggered her ambition to enter politics.\n\nShe decided to study philosophy at the University of Reading and became president of the students’ union, funding her studies by working in a Johnson & Johnson factory and as a magician’s assistant.\n\nBefore she became an MP, she worked on George W Bush’s presidential campaigns, and was a staffer during William Hague’s leadership of the Tory party.\n\nA former Royal Navy reservist, she won her own seat of Portsmouth North in 2010 from Labour and built her majority since then, but has fallen in the face of an onslaught from Labour.\n\nAway from politics, Ms Mordaunt took part in the ITV diving show Splash."
