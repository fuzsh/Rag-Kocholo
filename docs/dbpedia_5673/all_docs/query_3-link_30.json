        "text": "Labour’s plan to launch a tax raid on private schools is “crazy” and will drive more children into the state sector, Penny Mordaunt warned on Thursday.\n\nDuring the seven-party debate hosted by ITV newsreader Julie Etchingham, the Leader of the Commons said Sir Keir Starmer’s proposal “doesn’t serve anyone” and is “the kind of dogma we need to keep out of the public sector”.\n\nAddressing Angela Rayner during the event, she said: “What Angela and the Labour Party are going to do is, unbelievably, they are going to tax education”.\n\nShe added: “The result of that is some families will not be able to send their kids to the schools they’re currently going [to] but also they’ve admitted this week class sizes will go up as a consequence.\n\n“It’s crazy and it doesn’t serve anyone and it’s the kind of dogma that we need to keep out of the public sector.”\n\nMs Rayner defended the policy and suggested private schools should minimise the impact of it on the state sector by absorbing the costs of the tax raid.\n\nEarlier on Thursday, Bridget Phillipson, Labour’s shadow education secretary, told Sky News private schools “should frankly cut their cloth” and think about how they managed their budgets.\n\n“I think this is a straightforward, fair choice in terms of choosing to prioritise investment in state education, where 93 per cent of our children will go to school, the vast majority of your viewers will send their children to the local school. They want investment in more teachers and more mental health support.”\n\nPressed again on the question she was asked, and challenged on when fees would increase, Ms Phillipson said it was a “matter for a fiscal event”.\n\n“Private schools have had ample time to prepare. There is no requirement for them to pass this on to parents. But I would also just add that fees have gone up year-on-year, way beyond inflation, and there hasn’t been a change in terms of numbers.\n\n“So I think that private schools should frankly cut their cloth and make decisions around how they manage their budget.”\n\nImmigration and the economy were the other dominant topics in a lively seven-way debate which saw Ms Mordaunt sent out to bat for the Conservatives just minutes after a YouGov poll showed Reform pip her party to second place for the first time."
