But Mr Sunak is expected to avoid TV cameras as he campaigns in Yorkshire today. On Saturday, he did not do any interviews and ignored shouted questions from reporters.\n\nAll the main parties are preparing to unveil their manifestos in the next few days - and Labour are expected to include a new crackdown on violence against shop workers.\n\nShadow Home Secretary Yvette Cooper said Labour would take action to end the tide of aggression on frontline staff - and pledged to end the police practice of ignoring shoplifting reports for thefts of under £200.\n\nFollow the latest on the General Election below\n\n15:53John Stevens\n\nRishi Sunak emerges from hiding - but still won't answer questions\n\nRishi Sunak has come out of hiding. But he is still refusing to answer questions from journalists in the wake of his D-Day shame.\n\nThe Conservative Party has posted pictures on its Flickr account of the PM campaigning in Bedale in North Yorkshire, which is a short drive from the mansion where he lives in his constituency.\n\nHowever, Mr Sunak did not invite any media to join him. He has now avoided answering questions from journalists for at least 48 hours.\n\n14:27John Stevens\n\nTory apologises for D-Day tweet\n\nA Conservative councillor has apologised after appearing to suggest a Labour candidate should not have gone to France to take part in D-Day commemorations.\n\nDaniel Nelson on Saturday tweeted: \"Is the Labour candidate still in France?\" Bayo Alaba, who is standing for Labour in Southend East and Rochford, went to Normandy to take part in a fundraising parachute as part of 80th anniversary events.\n\nMr Nelson has now said sorry for his post, which has been deleted. He wrote: \"I wholeheartedly apologise to Bayo Alaba. I absolutely support his decision to be in France. As a brother of a serving member of the Armed Forces I understand the sacrifice of our veterans and would never want to disrespect that in any way. I have donated to Bayo’s campaign as the charities he was raising money for are incredibly worthy causes.\"\n\n11:49John Stevens\n\nNigel Farage defends 'dog whistle' attack on Rishi Sunak\n\nNigel Farage has defended his claim that Rishi Sunak does not understand \"our culture\".\n\nAmid criticism over the PM's decision to leave D-Day 80th anniversary commemorations in Normandy early, he Reform UK leader argued he \"doesn't really care about our history, he doesn't really care - frankly - about our culture\".\n\nMr Farage today defended his remarks, claiming he was talking about Mr Sunak's \"class\" rather than his background as the child of immigrants. Asked what he meant by that on the BBC's Sunday With Laura Kuenssberg, he said: \"I know what your question is leading at - 40% of our contribution in World War One and World War Two came from the Commonwealth. He is utterly disconnected by class, by privilege, from how the ordinary folk in this country feel. He revealed that, I think spectacularly, when he left Normandy early.\n\n\"Out there now there are millions and millions of people who were Conservative voters, traditional Conservative voters, not the red-wallers, who are now thinking 'Do we go on supporting the Conservatives or do we support Reform?' This is going to be, I think, the acid test of this election.\"\n\nLabour's Shabana Mahmood accused Mr Farage of using \"dog whistle\" tactics.\n\nNigel Farage under fire for 'dog whistle' attack on Rishi Sunak\n\n11:13Sophie Huskisson\n\nStarmer says Sunak will eventually have to come out of hiding\n\nAsked if the PM should stop hiding and face voters, Keir Starmer told reporters: “Well, I don't think I can speak for the prime minister on this. Clearly he's got questions he needs to answer in relation to what happened on D-Day, and at the moment, he doesn't seem to want to answer them.\n\n“But look, I'm here putting our positive case forward, making sure that I'm out and about talking to voters talking to you, of course, and being clear about our plans for the future. I'm really pleased that we're having that conversation with the voters and we're running a very positive campaign. I'm very happy to be out and about.”\n\nMr Starmer, who was taking part in a campaign event in Essex, added: “He will eventually have to come out and answer the questions that you put to him.”\n\n09:59John Stevens\n\nNigel Farage 'shouldn't be allowed to join Tories'\n\nEx-Cabinet minister Amber Rudd has said that Nigel Farage should not be allowed to join the Conservative Party.\n\nAsked if the Reform UK leader should be let in, the Tory told the BBC's Laura Kuenssberg: \"I certainly hope not.\"\n\nThe former Home Secretary added: \"I think he's a bad influence.\"\n\n09:04KEY EVENT\n\nTories insist Rishi Sunak won't quit before election\n\nThe Conservatives are trying to hose down suggestions that Rishi Sunak might quit before election day.\n\nIn a sign of how bad things are going, there have been whispers that the PM could throw in the towel.\n\nAsked if Mr Sunak is going to lead the party into the election, Work and Pensions Secretary Mel Stride told Sky News: \"Absolutely. And there's been no question of anything other than that.\"\n\n08:50John Stevens\n\nTories criticise Labour candidate for taking part in D-Day commemorations\n\nA Tory councillor is facing a backlash after he appeared to criticise a Labour candidate for taking part in commemorations to mark the 80th anniversary of D-Day.\n\nDaniel Nelson, who is a councillor in Southend, asked on X: \"Is the Labour candidate still in France?\"\n\nBayo Alaba, who is standing for Labour in Southend East and Rochford, was taking part in a parachute jump to remember Normandy airborne operations.\n\nLabour's Deputy Leader Angela Rayner said: \"Tories smearing Bayo Alaba, Labour’s candidate for Southend, for visiting France? We see you. He was parachuting into Normandy as part of the 80th anniversary of D-Day, to raise money for the Royal British Legion and Trust Links charities. We’re proud of him. Shame on you.\"\n\nFury as Tories criticise Labour candidate for taking part in D-Day event\n\n08:40John Stevens\n\nRishi Sunak 'cares about this country'\n\nA Tory Cabinet minister has insisted that Rishi Sunak is patriotic following his D-Day gaffe.\n\nAs he appeared on Sky News, Work and Pensions Secretary Mel Stride was grilled on whether the PM understood the significance of the 80th anniversary commemorations.\n\nMr Stride said: \"I know Rishi pretty well. In fact, I consider him something of a friend. I know that he's a deeply patriotic person. He cares greatly about this country.\"\n\nThe minister added: \"I know he will be feeling this very deeply... Of course he understood the weight of this event.\"\n\n08:37John Stevens\n\nTories deny they've run out of cash for social media ads\n\nWork and Pensions Secretary Mel Stride has denied claims the party has suspended social media campaignig as the party does not have funds for it.\n\nAppearing on Sky News, Mr Stride said: \"Not that I'm aware of. That's news to me.\"\n\nThe Conservative Party is usually flush with cash, but some donors are believed to be reluctant to hand over money because the campaign is going so badly.\n\n08:13KEY EVENT\n\nRishi Sunak 'dodges' reporters after D-Day shame\n\nRishi Sunak has been accused of dodging questions in the wake of his D-Day shame. The Prime Minister was forced to apologise for leaving 80th anniversary commemorations in Normandy early.\n\nMr Sunak is campaigning in Yorkshire without media today, after refusing to speak to any journalists yesterday following his D-Day snub.\n\nLabour’s Jonathan Ashworth, said: \"If Rishi Sunak is going to come out with yet another desperate wishlist of manifesto proposals this weekend, the least he can do is face up to proper public scrutiny over how he plans to pay for them, what the impact on people's finances will be, and when he intends to deliver on the first set of pledges he made to the British people eighteen months ago.\n\n“But instead, he has [been] ducking the cameras and dodging all those legitimate questions; just another farcical episode in this calamitous Conservative campaign.\"\n\n07:16Mikey Smith\n\nLabour manifesto to include crackdown on violence against shop workers\n\nLabour's manifesto will pledge laws to crack down on violence against shop staff, says Shadow Home Secretary Yvette Cooper.\n\nMs Cooper said the party would take action to end the tide of aggression – and vowed to stop police ignoring thefts valued at under £200.\n\nSpeaking to staff at a Co-op store, Ms Cooper heard harrowing tales of staff threatened with hammers and knives, and being sprayed with petrol.\n\nLabour manifesto to include crackdown on violence against shop workers\n\n21:48Mikey Smith\n\nJohnny Mercer denies rule breaking over campaign letters sent to neighbouring seats\n\nTory minister Johnny Mercer has denied breaking Commons rules by sending campaign material to constituents of neighbouring MPs.\n\nThe Veterans’ minister sent letters, on Commons headed notepaper, to people living in parts of Plymouth that will come under his current seat after boundaries are re-drawn for July’s General Elections. But Mr Mercer won’t be the MP there by the time their homes are part of the constituency - he’ll be a candidate seeking re-election.\n\nPolls suggest Mr Mercer is facing the boot at July’s election - with just an 8% chance of holding on to the seat, according to Electoral Calculus.\n\n20:43Mikey Smith\n\nNigel Farage's Reform UK took £120k of Covid cash - while saying 'scrap furlough'\n\nNigel Farage's Reform UK took more than £120,000 worth of furlough cash during the pandemic - despite arguing for the scheme to be shut down, The Mirror can reveal.\n\nMr Farage described the government's response to Covid-19 as \"woeful\", claiming lockdowns \"would result in more life-years lost than it hopes to save.\" But by the time the former Brexit Party was relaunched as Reform UK in November 2020, it had already claimed £67,372 in Coronovirus job retention funding from the Treasury.\n\nIn March 2021, former Brexit Party MEP Ben Habib, now Reform UK's Chairman, argued the scheme should be shuttered early. He told Talk Radio: \"That scheme basically costs around 10bn a month, that's an absolutely staggering amount of money. And to have that going on until September, when basically everyone's going to be vaccinated by June, just doesn't make any sense to me.\"\n\n19:43Simon Murphy\n\nTory filmed serving 'fun flour' to guest on David Cameron photo campaigns with Conservative chair\n\nThe Tory chair has been out election campaigning with a Conservative rising star filmed offering “fun flour” to a party guest on a signed David Cameron photo.\n\nRichard Holden canvassed with Philip Stephenson-Oliver just months after our revelations led to the latter’s suspension. But he appears to have been welcomed back into the fold by the Tories as he was snapped with Holden and a minister on the campaign trail.\n\nA grinning Holden posed alongside a group including Tory minister Felicity Buchan and Stephenson-Oliver – who he referred to as one of “the lads”. Holden has been at the centre of controversy this week after bagging a last-minute selection as the Tory candidate in a safe seat in Essex, sparking anger in the local party.\n\n19:05Susie Beever\n\nTwo thirds of voters disagree with Sunak's early D-Day departure, poll reveals\n\nSeven in 10 - or 68% - of the UK public say it is \"unacceptable\" that Rishi Sunak left D-Day commemorations early, according to a Savanta poll for The Telegraph.\n\nThat includes 61% of 2019 Conservative voters, the pollsters said. Chris Hopkins, Savanta's political research director, said: \"Rishi Sunak's actions this week may well go down as the greatest act of electoral self-harm in modern UK political history.\n\n\"Our snap poll suggests that his decision to leave D-Day commemorations early are roundly deemed unacceptable by the majority of the electorate, including 61% of 2019 Conservatives. Whether they vote Conservative again remains to be seen. Because so much of the Conservatives' electoral strategy was pinned on older, Reform UK-curious supporters, Sunak is uniquely vulnerable to upsetting this group of voters. How this will impact voting intention polls is genuinely unknown, because this situation is unprecedented.\"\n\n18:07Susie Beever\n\nPM slammed for 'dodging' media questioning\n\nLabour has criticised Rishi Sunak for \"ducking the cameras and dodging\" media questions on the campaign trail on Saturday.\n\nShadow paymaster general Jonathan Ashworth said: \"If Rishi Sunak is going to come out with yet another desperate wish list of manifesto proposals this weekend, the least he can do is face up to proper public scrutiny over how he plans to pay for them, what the impact on people's finances will be, and when he intends to deliver on the first set of pledges he made to the British people 18 months ago.\n\n\"But instead, he has spent the day ducking the cameras and dodging all those legitimate questions - just another farcical episode in this calamitous Conservative campaign. It's time to turn the page on this chaos, and vote for change with Labour on 4 July.\"\n\n17:10KEY EVENT\n\nTory candidate in Margaret Thatcher's old seat belittled groping allegation against Boris Johnson\n\nA Tory election candidate in Margaret Thatcher’s old seat once belittled a groping allegation against Boris Johnson, The Mirror can reveal.\n\nIn reference to the claim, Alex Deane said he was quoting the late Conservative diarist Alan Clark’s remark: “how do I know my advances are unwanted until I’ve made them?” It came after a female journalist accused the then PM Johnson of groping her leg under the table 20 years earlier.\n\nCharlotte Edwardes claimed Johnson, then Spectator magazine editor, grabbed “enough inner flesh beneath his fingers” to make her “sit suddenly upright” at a 1999 lunch. But Deane, standing for the Tories in Finchley and Golders Green in London at the election, played down the allegation – denied by Number 10 – after it emerged in 2019.\n\nIn a Sky News discussion with broadcaster Ayesha Hazarika about the allegation in 2019, he said: “...You’re talking about it as if it’s true.” Hazarika replied: “I think it is true, I believe her. I believe the victim here, I do believe the victim.”\n\n16:34Mikey Smith\n\nReform candidate saves Gavin Williamson's skin by quitting General Election race\n\nA Reform UK candidate has saved ex-Minister Gavin Williamson's skin by quitting the election race at the last minute and joining the Tories.\n\nThe former Defence Secretary denied accusations of \"dirty tricks\" after the last-minute defection. Party leader Nigel Farage repeatedly pledged not to stand any candidates down to help the Tories. In messages seen by the Mirror, Tom Wellings, Reform's candidate in Stone, Great Wryly and Penkridge, Staffordshire, told supporters \"I understand many of you were looking forward to having a Reform UK candidate... However after careful consideration and extensive analysis of recent local polling data I have made the decision to withdraw my candidacy.\"\n\nMr Wellings said he was concerned his candidacy risked splitting the vote in the seat, handing victory to Labour.\n\n14:42Anders Anglesey\n\nCount Binface to stand in Rishi Sunak's seat\n\nCount Binface has announced he will stand against Rishi Sunak in Richmond and Northallerton, in North Yorkshire.\n\nIn his announcement video, shared on X, formerly Twitter, the self-described intergalactic warrior said: \"You can see why someone from Southampton might want to hole up here. But I have a word on the wise that the people here are looking for an MP who can put them on the map.\n\n\"An MP who can give the folk of Richmond, London, something to think about. Because this is the real Richmond.\"\n\nCount Binface previously stood against ex-Prime Minister Boris HJOhnson in Uxbridge and South Ruislip in the 2019 General Election.\n\n13:49Anders Anglesey\n\nSunak dodges press questions after D-Day debacle\n\nThe Prime Minister visited a walled garden at Auckland Castle, Bishop Auckland, on Saturday’s campaign trail.\n\nAn opportunity for the media to ask questions of Rishi Sunak did not take place as was originally planned, likely following the fallout on Friday of his early return from D-Day commemorations in Normandy.\n\nAt the garden, Mr Sunak spoke with volunteers Margaret Lambert and Hilary Bellwood, who encouraged him to apply for an allotment garden.\n\nHe also watered plants with Jane MacBean, Conservative candidate for Bishop Auckland.\n\nMembers of the public could be seen gathered at a hillside above the garden to try and catch a glimpse of the Prime Minister within.\n\n12:24Anders Anglesey\n\nBBC debate audience member hailed 'real winner' for savage Farage reaction\n\nAmid several bad-tempered answers from the likes of Nigel Farage and Penny Mordaunt, the camera kept cutting back to one man in the audience who was following the action with a right old scowl on his face.\n\nViewers were delighted the camera team found someone who summed up the events of the evening so succinctly, especially when Farage claimed this year's general election should be \"the immigration election.\"\n\nTV reviewer Scott Bryan tweeted a clip of the camera cutting away from Reform UK leader Nigel Farage to the man in the white t-shirt. \"The man shaking his head is a meme,\" he declared.\n\nRead more: BBC debate audience member hailed 'real winner' for savage reaction to Farage\n\n11:21Anders Anglesey\n\nSunak's D-Day event snub was \"letdown for our whole country,\" says Lib Dems' Davey\n\nSir Ed Davey has said Rishi Sunak’s snub of a major international D-Day event was “a letdown for our whole country”.\n\nOn a campaign visit to Victoria Park in Newbury, Berkshire, the Liberal Democrats leader told broadcasters: “I’ve felt pretty cross about this. I’ve talked to veterans and they feel quite angry. So, I think they need to do more.”\n\nHe urged the Conservatives to give some of the cash donated to the party by Frank Hester, a businessman who was embroiled in a racism row, to charity.\n\n“I think the Conservative Party should give £5 million of that donation to a veterans charity. I think if they did that, then people might be able to draw the line.\n\n“But it’s such a letdown for our whole country and our history, particularly for our brave veterans.”\n\n10:42Anders Anglesey\n\nLabour manifesto will promise to close fox hunting loopholes\n\nLabour will vow to speed up the end of animal testing and close loopholes in the existing fox hunting ban in its manifesto.\n\nThe party will put forward a comprehensive plan to tackle animal cruelty that will also stop the import of hunting trophies from abroad.\n\nSinger and campaigner Will Young tonight gave his backing to the party as it prepared to unveil the “biggest boost in animal welfare for a generation”.\n\nLabour will promise to ban the importation of designer dogs and cats with fashion-based mutilations, as well as banning the sale of animals with cropped ears. The importation of heavily pregnant dogs and cats will be banned.\n\nRead more: Labour manifesto will promise to phase out animal testing and close fix hunting loopholes\n\n09:21Anders Anglesey\n\nTory minister tells PM Sunak 'it's over'\n\nOne of Rishi Sunak's own ministers has warned \"it's over\" the PM's election campaign lies in tatters after he shamefully skipped a D-Day event.\n\nThe PM was forced to apologise for flying home early from Normandy to record a TV interview, admitting it had been \"a mistake.\" Conservatives have now turned on one another over the extraordinary snub to veterans.\n\nThere have even been warnings Sunak would have been immediately ousted as party leader if it had not been the middle of the General Election campaign. One minister told The Mirror: \"Don't even ask. The wheels have come off. It's over.\"\n\nRead more: Tory minister tells Rishi Sunak 'it's over' as D-Day snub ends election hopes\n\n08:15Anders Anglesey\n\nTories forced to continue defending Rishi Sunak's D-Day event debacle\n\nTransport Secretary Mark Harper said he agreed with Rishi Sunak that it was a mistake to leave D-Day events early.\n\nAsked whether he agreed with fellow Cabinet minister Penny Mordaunt’s assessment that it was “completely wrong”, Mr Harper told BBC Breakfast on Saturday: “I don’t know what the detail was of putting the Prime Minister’s schedule together, which, as he said, was done some time ago before the election campaign was called.\n\n“But look, it was a mistake. People make mistakes. The Prime Minister has made a mistake. He’s apologised for it. And he’s apologised to those that would have been particularly hurt by it.”\n\nMr Harper also said: “I agree with the words that he set out in his remarks yesterday when he was interviewed about it.”\n\n21:46Anders Anglesey\n\nClosing statements: Plaid Cymru's Rhun ap Iorwerth\n\nIorwerth called for a different type of politics in his closing statement.\n\nHe said the General Election was an opportunity to send a message to Labour, namely - stop taking Wales for granted.\n\n21:44Anders Anglesey\n\nClosing statements: SNP's Stephen Flynn\n\nFlynn echoed other party leaders, branding the Tories as \"finished.\"\n\nHe claimed the SNP would focus on the NHS and rejoin the single market as well as deliver on net zero commitments.\n\n21:42Anders Anglesey\n\nClosing statements: Green Party's Carla Denyer\n\nAccording to Denyer, the Tories are \"toast\" before she pitched the Green Party as an alternative to Labour.\n\nShe argued that the Green Party was close to winning seats across the UK.\n\n21:42Mikey Smith\n\nRayner 'the clear winner' - but Mordaunt sticking the boot in was memorable\n\nSpeaking in the spin room after the debate, a Labour spokesperson said: \"Angela did very well, she was the clear winner out of it.\n\n\"I think the most memorable thing for people will be was how Penny just totally just totally put the boot into Sunak over the D-Day stuff. She basically agreed when Angela said 'you've put taxes up to the highest level in 70 years. And she defended Liz Truss. So that's quite a triple whammy from Penny in the debate tonight.\"\n\nThe spokesperson agreed that, while Penny Mordaunt was hard on the PM, it still seemed unsatisfying.\n\n\"I'm surprised she didn't get more heat over it,\" he added.\n\nTop StoriesDon't Miss\n\nMORE ON"
