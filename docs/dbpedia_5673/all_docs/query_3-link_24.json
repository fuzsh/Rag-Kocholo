        "text": "Prime Minister Theresa May’s decision to step down on June 7 has fired the starting gun for a Conservative Party leadership race that could redefine Britain’s exit from the European Union. Here’s a look at some of the possible candidates in what could be a bitter and dramatic contest.\n\nBoris Johnson, or “Boris” as he’s known to just about everyone in politics, as a child wanted to be “World King.” No surprise, then, that he has confirmed he will run to be British prime minister. The 54-year-old quit Cabinet in protest at May’s Brexit compromise plan last year, and has been railing against her “surrender” ever since in well remunerated columns for the Daily Telegraph."
