        "text": "A-Z M7\n\nMarch 31, 2018, 7:28 pm\n\nFiled under: Uncategorized\n\nQuite a few, but trying to catch up with myself!\n\nMoore, Richard Henry (‘Dick’) (262 – Amateur) born Charminster, Dorset 14.11.1913, died Denbighshire, Wales 1.3.2002. Batsman Dick Moore holds the record for the highest individual first-class score for Hampshire, 316 v Warwickshire at Bournemouth in 1937, scored in one day and including a century before lunch. On three occasions in the 21st century, John Crawley (twice) and Michael Carberry have reached 300, in sight of that record, and each time the captain declared – perhaps it will never be broken. Having impressed at Bournemouth School, Moore played occasionally for Hampshire between 1931-1933, with a fine century v Essex (159) but otherwise a fairly modest record; then in 1934 he passed 1,500 runs at an average of 30.17, and after another relatively fallow year caused by a serious illness, he was appointed captain in 1936, a position he held for two years, scoring four centuries and passing 1,000 runs in each season. When Cecil Paris replaced him in 1938, Moore was still only 24 and his average of 42.00 from 11 matches was his best, but business made growing demands on him, as it did increasingly on amateurs through the last 25 years of their participation in first-class cricket. There were just four first-class matches in 1939; during the war, he played in a number of services and other matches, and when non-first-class county cricket returned to Southampton in 1945 he played a match v Sussex. After that he moved to Wales and continued to play some cricket there, before becoming Chairman of Colwyn Bay CC, although in 1952, he was reunited with former colleagues for a match at Bournemouth v the current Hampshire side, in aid of George Heath’s testimonial.\n\nMordaunt, Sir Henry John (Pre ’95 – Amateur) born London 12.7.1867, died London 15.1.1939. He came from a large cricketing family and while at Eton where he captained the XI in 1886, he played one match for Hampshire the previous season, after which the county lost its first-class status, although he played for them again in 1887. He played also at Cambridge University where he won his ‘blue’ in 1888 & 1889, and in seven matches for Middlesex from 1889-1893. In his first-class match for Hampshire, v Somerset he was dismissed without scoring in his one innings and did not bowl. His career was in education and he succeeded to the family title in 1934.\n\nMornement, Dr Robert Harry (130 – Amateur) born Norfolk 15.8.1873, died Chatham 16.4.1948. He was a medium-pace bowler, who played in three first-class matches for Hampshire in 1906 and two more for the Combined Army & Navy XI v the Combined Universities in 1910 & 1911. For Hampshire, he scored 41 runs at 8.20 and took six wickets at 28.50, including 3-62 v Yorkshire on debut. He played also for Norfolk, MCC and in other Army matches.\n\nMorris, Alexander Corfield (‘Alex’) (444) born Barnsley 4.10.1976. Alex Morris was a pace-bowling all-rounder who played for England under-19s and his native Yorkshire, before moving to Hampshire in 1998. He was a good enough cricketer to win his county cap in 2001, but he struggled with injuries – only in that debut season and in 2001 did his first-class appearances reach double figures, and in the latter, he scored 423 runs at 24.88 with three half-centuries, and took 51 wickets at 28.00, as Hampshire won promotion. He was only 24 and highly promising, but there were just four first-class matches in the next two seasons, before he retired. In 15 limited-overs matches he took 18 wickets.\n\nMorris, Robert Sean Millner (417) born Buckinghamshire 10.9.1968. He was a right-handed batsman and one of a group of young players who it was hoped would eventually replace Mark Nicholas’s side. He played at Durham University, and for various county 2nd XIs before settling with Hampshire in 1989, while playing also for Lymington in the Southern League. In May 1992, he made his first-class debut for Hampshire v Oxford University and played a few more Championship matches that year plus, in August, his limited-overs debut v Kent. In 1994, he scored his maiden century and added a second in compiling 686 runs at 49.00 – his best was 174 v Nottinghamshire at Basingstoke, but a month later at Portsmouth his hand was badly damaged by a ball from Gloucestershire’s Courtney Walsh. He played no more that year, and in a further 15 matches in the next two seasons, passed 50 only once, an innings of 112 v Cambridge University. It seemed that the injury had damaged his hand and his confidence and he retired at 26 and pursued a career with the PCA, while playing occasionally for Free Foresters, MCC and others. In both competitions for Hampshire he averaged just a fraction under 30 with a limited-overs best of 87 v Gloucestershire in 1995.\n\nMorris, Zachary Clegg (‘Zach’) (445) born Barnsley 4.9.1978. He was a slow-left-arm bowler who came to Hampshire from Yorkshire in 1998, with his older brother ‘Alex’ having, like him, played for England under-19s. He played in just two first-class matches for Hampshire scoring 11 runs but failing to take a wicket. In four limited-overs matches his best bowling was 3-31 v Worcestershire at the Rose Bowl in 2001 – the one occasion on which he took wickets for the county. He left at the end of that season and returned to Yorkshire where he played league cricket for Hoylandswaine.\n\nMottram, Thomas James (‘Tom’) (367) born Liverpool 7.9.1945. Tom Mottram was a tall, pace-bowler, not strictly fast but accurate, who played a surprising, but key role in Hampshire’s second Championship in 1973. In 1968 & 1969 he played club cricket for Liverpool, and in 1970 played for Lancashire 2nd XI but also for Hampshire 2nd XI. He was an architect and in a sense, a reminder of the old category of amateur players which had been abolished from 1963. He made his first-class debut for Hampshire v the Australians in 1972, taking 3-45, and after a few more games that year played regularly in 1973, forming a remarkably effective opening partnership with Bob Herman. He played in 17 of the 20 Championship matches, taking 57 wickets at 22.00, including a remarkable caught-and-bowled from Northamptonshire’s Roy Virgin in the vital match, which precipitated their collapse to 108 all out.\n\nAt the end of that season Hampshire chose to sign Andy Roberts in place of spinner David O’Sullivan as their second overseas player, and while O’Sullivan was justified in feeling somewhat hard done by, Mottram too found himself excluded in 1974, although he played some matches in the next two seasons. He continued to play in limited-overs matches until the end of 1977, including as Hampshire won the Sunday League in 1975 – he took 5-21 in the decisive match v Derbyshire at Darley Dale. He played in 35 first-class matches for Hampshire, taking 111 wickets at 24.11 and in 83 limited-overs games, taking 135 wickets at 18.69 – in both cases very fine figures, although he was no batsman, reaching double figures in only three first-class innings, and none in limited-overs games. He has a clear place in the county’s history however, as one of the 13 men who took them to their second, and currently last, Championship.\n\nMullally, Alan David (406) born Southend, Essex 12.7.1969. Left-arm pace bowler Mullally was born in England but raised in Australia. After matches for Western Australia, he came to England to play with Hampshire in 1988 but after one first-class match v Oxford University, moved to Leicestershire, with whom he won the County Championship. In 2000, he left Leicestershire and returned to Hampshire, playing there for six more years, with just three limited-overs matches in 2005, his final season. He played in 19 Test Matches for England from 1996, with one final (Ashes’) game in 2001 after returning to Hampshire, taking 58 Test wickets at 31.24.\n\nHampshire were relegated in his first season on return but he took 49 wickets very cheaply, including 9-93 v Derbyshire at Derby. In the following year as Hampshire won promotion, his 64 wickets with a best of 8-90 were only slightly more expensive at 18.50; overall, he took 192 wickets for the county at 23.43, 13 times taking five or more in the innings. He played occasional matches subsequently for Lashings, and worked as a county commentator with Kevan James for BBC Radio Solent, but then returned to Australia\n\nMurgatroyd Henry (Pre ’95) born Swindon 19.9.1853, died Portsmouth 15.3.1905. He played in one match in 1883 v Sussex at Hove, scoring 1 & 1* and taking 0-7, in an innings defeat.\n\nMurtagh, Andrew Joseph (369) born Dublin 6.5.1949. Although born in Ireland, batting all-rounder Murtagh played cricket in the London area and then at Southampton University, where he was spotted by Hampshire and invited to play for their 2nd XI in 1968. He made his Championship and limited-overs debut for the county in 1973, and while always a ‘reserve’ covering injuries, played in five Championship matches in that first season, one of just 13 men who played their part in Hampshire winning their second title. He did not play in the 1974 Championship but appeared in a few matches from 1975-1977, with a best score of 65 v Gloucestershire at Bournemouth in 1975. Overall, he took six first-class wickets, while he played in 48 limited-overs matches with 481 runs at 16.58 and 23 wickets at 19.73, including a best of 5-33 v Yorkshire at Huddersfield in 1977 – including their top-scorer G Boycott. He appeared in eight (of 16) matches when Hampshire won the 1975 Sunday League. After leaving Hampshire, he was a teacher at Malvern College until retiring in 2000, since when he has written a number of admired cricket biographies, including his former team-mates Barry Richards and John Holder, plus George Chesterton and Tom Graveney.\n\nMyburgh, Johannes Gerhardus (510) born Transvaal, South Africa 22.10.1980. He played in South Africa before coming to Hampshire in 2011, playing in all three formats. In six first-class matches for the county he scored 287 runs at 26.09, adding 81 limited-overs runs in three matches, and most successfully, 223 T20 runs at 44.60 with two half-centuries and a career best of 88 v Windward Islands in the semi-final of the Caribbean T20 tournament. He has played subsequently for Durham and Somerset.\n\n5 Comments"
