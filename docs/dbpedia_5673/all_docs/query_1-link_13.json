        "text": "“This year I have taken over as chair of the Polio Oversight Board. That’s why my first trip of the New Year was to Afghanistan and Pakistan. These are the two countries that are the last frontier of wild poliovirus. We are so close to ridding humanity of this disease, and I am personally committed to ensuring that we do. I was really impressed by the commitment of the governments of Afghanistan and Pakistan.”\n\n“Wild viruses and wildfires have two things in common. If neglected, they can spread out of control. If handled properly, they can be stamped out for good. Today, the flame of polio is near extinction — but sparks in three countries threaten to ignite a global blaze. Now is the moment to act.”\n\nAddressing the Governors’ Forum in Abuja, Nigeria, 24 May 2011:\n\n“You have made tremendous progress [in] the past year. Polio cases are down by 95 per cent. But, if we let our guard down for a minute, polio can spring back. We cannot let this happen. Let us eradicate this crippling disease once and for all.”\n\n“This [India’s removal from the list of countries with active transmission of endemic polio] gives us hope that we can finally eradicate polio not only from India but from the face of the entire mother earth… The real credit goes to the 2.3 million volunteers who repeatedly vaccinated children even in the most remote areas, often in very bad weather conditions…I commend each one of them for their dedication, commitment and selfless service.”\n\n“Imagine a ship, imperilled at sea, with hundreds of children on board. Of course the international community would respond immediately and fully. Yet, each year poverty and polio steal the lives and the childhood of hundreds of thousands of Congolese children. We have the capacity and the moral obligation to save them – but do we have the will?”\n\n“Polio cases have reduced by more than 99% over the last 30 years. In 1998 there were over 350,000 cases – in 2017, there were only 22 cases worldwide. This is proof that UK aid works.”\n\n“Britain can be proud of the leading role it has played in one of the greatest public health success stories of all time as polio will become only the second human disease to be eradicated from the world, after smallpox. In the future, global attention on polio will need to be maintained, to ensure the world remains rid of this disease.”\n\n“We are within grasp of declaring the end of polio worldwide… We need to keep this action going. We know it will yield real results. At the end of the day, it’s a simple action of two drops of vaccine. We can do that in our world and end polio forever.”\n\n“Nearly eradicated is not good enough… When we have the vaccines and tools to save children’s lives, it is not good enough to wait. Because while we wait, children are dying. As long as one child remains at risk, all children remain at risk, and that isn’t a risk we can take… few ideas are more powerful than the eradication of human disease – what is missing is the political will to see it through. Let us eradicate polio once and for all.”\n\nAnnouncing on 28 January 2011 that the United Kingdom would double its contribution to polio (for 2011-2012) even in the midst of the recession:\n\n“There is never a wrong time to do the right thing.\n\nI passionately believe that we have a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to rid the world of the evil of polio. We have the vaccines and the tools to do it. All that’s missing is real and sustained political will to see this effort through to the end.”\n\n“Every child deserves the right to run, to play and to live a healthy life without polio.\n\nI’m proud to be here today to immunize children against polio. It is critical that all Indian children continue to be immunized against polio until this disease has been eradicated all over the world. We all hope that happens soon.”"
