        "text": "Written by Peter Hartland\n\nIntroduction\n\nThe digitisation of publications such as Cricket: A Weekly Record of the Game (1882-1913), The World of Cricket (1914) and The Cricketer (1921-84), together with that of local newspapers, has shone new light on the history of cricket clubs such as Sussex Martlets.\n\nThese publications covered club cricket in great detail, offering a wealth of full scorecards, potted scores, match reports, notable achievements and season averages. For example, Cricket published the full playing records, batting and bowling, of all 91 cricketers to turn out for the Martlets in 1911. The Sportsman newspaper had done the same for three previous seasons: 1907, 1909 and 1910. There were over 400 members by 1911, including CB Fry and Ranjitsinhji who both supported the Club, though Ranji played only once and Fry not at all. Public school cricket also enjoyed full coverage, which can be cross-referenced with the wandering clubs the schools all faced.\n\nAnother boost was the discovery in Chichester of a full set of Sussex Martlets scorebooks running from 1926 to 1953. Considerable care was taken to record matches in those days. With the fine anniversary histories produced by Geoffrey Bolton (1955) and David Gibbs (2005), and Sandy Ross’s comprehensive appendices incorporated in the latter; the various Sussex cricket annuals; Cricket Archive‘s scorecard database; and a miscellany of internal Martlet material, both online and at the Sussex CCC Museum archive at Hove, there is now a reasonably complete statistical record of the Club.\n\nEarly History\n\nThe Club was founded in 1905 as the Hove Long Vacation Club. It sounds an odd name but accurately describes the original purpose, which was to provide good cricket during the summer holidays for schoolmasters, undergraduates and officers in the armed services who were on the fringe of the county side. Hove was the best batting pitch in the country, and Fry and Ranji among the leading batsmen, but there was no comparable bowling.\n\nNeighbours Kent and Surrey had their own long-standing wandering clubs, respectively Band of Brothers (established 1858) and Wanderers (1878), and Surrey had been much more successful in the county championship. To the west Hampshire Hogs dated back to 1887. A Sussex-based equivalent was overdue. The Club was renamed Sussex Martlets in 1907.\n\nThe most famous founding member was Arthur Conan Doyle. The first outstanding performer was Australian-born fast bowler Harry Simms, who took 80 wickets in 1907 and 92 the following year. Only one bowler has captured more wickets in a season for the Martlets. In 1911 Harry’s younger brother Roy scored 860 runs.\n\n29 fixtures were completed that year, of which seven survive today: Cuckfield, Eastbourne, Horsham and the public schools at Brighton, Eastbourne, Lancing and Christ’s Hospital. Lancing Old Boys (now Rovers) came on board the following year. When war was declared in early August 1914, all Martlets cricket was immediately cancelled and did not restart until July 1919.\n\nRecords Overview\n\nThe first thing to bear in mind when looking at the records is the change in the size of the fixture list. During the initial ten seasons from the formation of the Club to the First World War, the average number of completed matches per year was in the mid twenties. A similar level was maintained during the 1920s and 1930s. The immediate post-war years 1945-49 saw a slight reduction as the Club found its feet again. There was then an explosive rise to 51 matches a year in the 1950s, before an average all-time high of 87 during the 1960s, when two or occasionally three games might be staged on the same day. The high water mark was 1966 when 99 matches were played out of 113 arranged. Since then, lifestyle changes and the introduction of league cricket in the south have progressively trimmed back the fixture list. Completed matches per annum in the twenty-first century lie around the thirty mark.\n\nBroadly speaking victories outnumbered defeats during the first half of the Club’s history, apart from the 1920s. Cricketers with first-class experience were often in the ranks, which was a factor. The Cricketer‘s opinion in 1935 was that there was no stronger club in Sussex. During the past fifty years or so results have been the other way round, though the gap is narrowing. A sharp fall in the proportion of drawn matches since the turn of the millennium no doubt owes something to the philosophy engendered by T20.\n\nLeading Bowlers\n\nWhen David Gibbs said that three Sussex Martlets bowlers stood above all others he was not exaggerating. Gerry Campbell, Eddie Harrison and Sandy Ross each took more than 800 wickets for the Club. All three delivered on the brisk side of medium pace. Such career aggregates are rare among wandering clubs, which tend to have a lot of members playing relatively few games. Campbell’s tally was concentrated into a tighter timeframe: 23 seasons excluding 1915-18. He is the only man to claim over a hundred wickets in a season, a feat he achieved twice.\n\nHarrison’s career spanned more than fifty years and Ross’s over forty, the former also being interrupted by war. Lying fourth and fifth in the wickets table are the South African leg-spinner Basil Woods (450+) and off-spinning all-rounder Brian O’Gorman. 42 bowlers have taken a hundred or more wickets for the Club. It is a reflection of today’s reduced fixture list that only four of them, Michael Murray, Mark Trubshaw, Paul Walker and Johnny Wills, are still playing.\n\nBatting Feats\n\nRuns have been more evenly spread around, with 39 batsmen registering over 2,000. Only two have scored a thousand in a season, Reginald Pinfield in 1921 and the Irishman Robin Waters in 1959. Both were hot summers. Waters was also one of the best wicket-keepers on the circuit.\n\nMartlets matches have generally been played on good pitches and a lot of centuries have been scored. 231 different batsmen have reached three figures for the Club and all are listed here. Three innings in excess of 200 have been registered, the most recent by Sam Cooper against Old Hurstjohnians in 2015. The highest score is 330 not out by Ken Fry (CB’s cousin) in a two-day match against Cuckfield in 1907. It is likely to remain so.\n\nA near miss on a double century was recorded by perhaps the most distinguished Martlet centurion, when KS Duleepsinhji carried his bat for 195 not out against Old Malvernians at Hove in 1924. Duleep was leading Martlet runscorer that year, as was another future England batsman David Sheppard in 1947. Each year’s leading run-scorer and wicket-taker are shown on the next page.\n\nFinally, spare a thought for RAM Stradling in another two-day two-innings affair against United Services at Portsmouth in 1930. In Sussex Martlets’ first innings he carried his bat for 103. Opening again in the second, he made 142 as the visitors were dismissed for 251. Somehow Stradling managed to end up on the losing side as Martlets were defeated by seven wickets!\n\nRESULTS\n\n1905-14: Played 238, Won 105, Lost 87, Drawn 46, Tied 0, Matches/Year 24\n\n1919-29:
