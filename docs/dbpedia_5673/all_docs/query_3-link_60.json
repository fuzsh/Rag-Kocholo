Finch has reached the key stages of the Apprenticeship; working for 780 hours (the equivalent of two A Levels), achieving Key Skills at Level 2 in communication and application, a BTEC National Award in Sport, and the ECB delivered NVQ element of the qualification.\n\nThe NVQ Level 3 in Sporting Excellence includes education on physical conditioning, lifestyle, nutrition, business management and media training, providing a portfolio of understanding for young cricketers as they embark on their senior careers.\n\nAll 16-18 year olds within First Class County Academies are eligible to join the scheme, which lasts approximately 22 months. By December 2008, a further 49 players are expected to complete the Apprenticeship.\n\nFinch, who joined Esholt after leaving Guiseley, said: \"I really enjoyed the apprenticeship course and feel this will be invaluable to me as something to fall back on should my cricket career not kick on as I would hope it will do. I'd like to thank Tony Pickersgill for his help and assistance throughout the course.\"\n\nFinch, a right hand bat and right arm off spin bowler made his county debut in the Second XI Championship in April, 2006 against Durham at Stamford Bridge. His Second XI Championship career best bowling is 4-75. for Yorkshire against Sussex at Hove in 2006.\n\nHe was promoted from the Academy to Junior Professional in 2008. As a schools player he went on the schools' exchange visit to Bloemfontein, South Africa."
