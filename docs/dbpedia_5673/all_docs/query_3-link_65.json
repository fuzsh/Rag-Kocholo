        "text": "Good Thursday morning, and happy local elections day. This is Dan Bloom.\n\nDRIVING THE DAY\n\nON YOUR MARKS … Millions of people across England and Wales head to the polls for the final time today before the general election in [insert month here]. Today’s sprawling elections covering 11 regional mayors, 2,600 local councillors, 37 police commissioners, the entire London Assembly and the Blackpool South by-election look like Rishi Sunak’s last chance to stem talk of a Labour landslide at the general … and perhaps the Tory plotters’ last chance to oust him before the big day.\n\nGet set … Sunak is campaigning in an undisclosed region, and pool cameras will snap Starmer voting in London.\n\n… Wait! But the usual broadcasting rules on voting day mean no media rounds or pool clips are allowed, making for a slow start to this four-day fiesta of spin, expectation management and (most importantly!) democracy. We should at least have some big news in the SNP leadership contest to keep us occupied this morning — more details on that below.\n\n**A message from Lloyds Banking Group: Lloyds Banking Group has championed the social housing sector for decades by providing finance and support to more than 340 housing associations across the UK to help people find a place to call home. It is one of the ways we are helping Britain prosper. Find out more.**\n\nSO, DOWN TO BUSINESS: Let’s rattle through what’s in play.\n\nMAYORS: The easy headline (which Tories have pushed hard). London is obviously the biggest prize in town, but you’d be hard pushed to find anyone who doesn’t think Sadiq Khan will win a third term — while other big Labour cities like Manchester and Liverpool are only going to vote one way. Starmer told Labour’s NEC in March his key targets are the West Midlands, Tees Valley and the newly created East Midlands mayoralties, as they contain plenty of marginal seats plus high-profile Tory incumbents Andy Street and Ben Houchen. So they’re the ones to keep your eyes on over the next few days.\n\nAnd how’s that going? Labour aides are sure they’ll win East Mids, but now say Tees Valley is a no-hoper. Both sides say West Mids — where Playbook hears every Labour MP was asked to have “at least 10 conversations” in the final two days — is on a knife-edge. The final narrative from today’s elections may ultimately hang on which way that one goes.\n\nMayoral surprises? Three more people tell your author Labour is eyeing an upset in another newly created mayoralty, York and North Yorkshire, echoing the growing chatter that a seat once assumed to be safe Tory now looks anything but. Says one: “If we don’t [win it], it will be tight.” Labour’s official channels are quick to hose down any hope of victory, but Playbook’s mole says supporters in Lab/Lib York city are “very engaged,” while campaigners are finding “true blue” rural areas “suddenly voting red.” One to watch.\n\nHaving a mare: Expect Tory spinners to hail victory if either (or both) of Houchen or Street hold their seats — while Labour spinners focus on both men’s efforts to distance themselves from Sunak during the campaign. Houchen told the Independent’s new pol ed David Maddox that many of his backers “probably won’t be voting for the Conservative Party in the general election.”\n\nIndeed: My colleague Esther Webber has a big piece on this today, noting how the most successful Tory campaigners seem to be spending an awful lot of time, erm, pretending not to be Tories. It’s a pattern playing out in the general election campaign too. One parliamentary candidate tells Esther: “A lot of us are now just trying to work out how to distance ourselves from the indefensible, and make this about me.” Good luck!\n\nBLACKPOOL SOUTH BY-ELECTION: Labour aides are putting the bellows under this one — unsurprisingly, given victory seems assured. The Tories have already lost about a zillion by-elections in the current parliament, and this one has the added whiff of scandal following ex-MP Scott Benton’s lobbying sting. Labour officials argue this is in fact the most important result of the night, and that a swing of more than 12 percent would signal a general election majority for Keir Starmer. Tory MPs will be keeping a nervous eye on Reform’s performance here.\n\nPOLICE COMMISSIONERS: Boring? Never! Now elected via first-past-the-post, these lowkey elections can be a useful wind sock in regions where Labour needs to win big in the general. Tory strategists claim they could lose up to half of their 29. Playbook is told Labour strategists privately think they’re in with a chance of gaining up to 12, while Lib Dems are eyeing three.\n\nCOUNCILS: Tories and Labour are each defending nearly 1,000 seats last up in 2021 — the Tories’ best year since 2008 and a low point for Labour. Rallings and Thrasher analysis says Conservatives could lose 500 seats while Labour gains 300. Tories say that’s about right; Labour says it’s too ambitious.\n\nGet those excuses in early: Chancellor Jeremy Hunt told Sky News “we are expecting to see significant losses,” while Starmer told Sky’s Beth Rigby the race for West Midlands mayor is “very, very tight.” Starmer also said that “I haven’t put a number on” the number of council seats he wants to gain. It’s worth remembering the bar is low — Labour performed so badly the last time these seats were up for grabs that Starmer almost quit.\n\nAlso worth remembering: For the parties, the tedious micro-data buried in these results is often the most important thing. Playbook hears Labour will be crunching “aggregate vote share” across all council wards in each Westminster target seat, to calculate if each one has swung enough to win at a general election.\n\nTV GUIDE: Laura Kuenssberg and team host an overnight BBC show from 11.40 p.m. featuring polling prof John Curtice … Sky have a 10 p.m. analysis of how Tory peer and pollster Robert Hayward reckons the key races have gone … and an overnight show from midnight with expert Michael Thrasher … BBC Radio 4 and Radio 5 Live run from 11 p.m., including political scientist Philip Cowley … LBC Radio has an overnight special … frontbenchers will drill spin lines across all channels … and ITV’s Good Morning Britain from 6 a.m. has Thrasher’s co-expert Colin Rallings, plus (duck for cover!) Nadine Dorries.\n\nReading the results: On Friday afternoon, the BBC should carry its “projected national share” (PNS) from Team Curtice. This models each party’s percentage vote based on 800 council wards. Sky News is promising “the first digital projections” of Commons seats on the same day. Rallings and Thrasher’s “national equivalent vote” (NEV) projection then runs in the Sunday Times. Think of PNS and NEV as the Coke and Pepsi of the nerd world.\n\nHuge caveat: We won’t know much by dawn Friday. Only 600 council seats will be declared overnight, along with Blackpool South and three PCCs. The first mayoral results won’t start coming in until Friday lunchtime, and we could be waiting until late on Saturday for London and the all-important West Midlands. In the meantime expect all parties to seize on early results to build a narrative … or to say it’s too early to tell … or both. Choose your own adventure!\n\nJust remember to bring your ID. Looking at you, Tory MP Tom Hunt.\n\nPLOTTERS LURK: Those publicity-shy Tories who want to get rid of Sunak before the election (and once promised a “May Day from hell”) will be focusing heavily on the Blackpool South result overnight, Playbook is told — especially if Reform knocks the Tories into third place. Says one: “Narrative-wise, it could start to go against the government quite quickly.”\n\nPlotters plot: Rebels tell the Times’ Steven Swinford they can hit the threshold of 53 no-confidence letters. But we’ve heard that one before. And the Express hears Penny Mordaunt has had “detailed discussions” with “a number of senior right-wingers” about replacing Sunak if he’s toppled. It feels reminiscent of that Mordaunt briefing last month (and an ally tells Lister it’s “hooey” this time too).\n\nSCOOP — SHOW THE PLOTTERS THIS: Only 49 percent of Conservative Party members say Sunak should lead them into the general election, according to a poll of 537 of them by FindOutNow for … Starmerite group Labour Together. Some 32 percent said the PM should quit if the Tories lose more than a third of their council seats, up to 39 percent if they lose half and 46 percent if they lose even more.\n\nPlotters take note: The poll asked members to pick the best of the five Tory leaders since 2010. Boris Johnson had 56 percent … David Cameron 19 percent … Sunak 11 percent … and Theresa May and Liz Truss each 5 percent.\n\nDon’t ask him! “We don’t really have *any* good politicians who are leaders of political parties,” Curtice told an Institute for Government event last night. Curtice also predicted Sunak will “run the clock” down to November to get “two years in the bank” as PM because if the Tories lose the general election, his “political career is over … he might as well go back and make some more money in California or enjoy a swimming pool.” Wow. Mean.\n\nIN THE MEANTIME: Election day is marked by front pages on two of Labour’s trickier issues — whether it’ll water down its workers’ rights pledges (Guardian and FT), and how it would deal with ditching the Rwanda migration plan (Times).\n\nON WORKERS’ RIGHTS: Playbook hears Wednesday’s report that Labour’s “new deal” would be weakened prompted a flurry of calls from Labour politicians to union bigwigs, trying to convince them the package hasn’t changed. Not all sound persuaded. Unite chief Sharon Graham tweeted “a red line will be crossed” if Labour doesn’t recommit to its pledges. Left-winger Matt Wrack tells today’s FT: “No rolling back.”\n\nSo what’s going on? Labour’s plans were *already* sort of watered down last year as part of its National Policy Forum, which added layers of consultation and so forth. Now the detail of what that means in practice is seeping out. E.g., “Labour will ban zero hours contracts” got turned into banning “exploitative” zero-hour contracts … and now the Guardian says workers would be allowed to stay on zero-hour contracts if they want to.\n\nThe problem is … Labour’s original “new deal” for workers is, er, still online without those pesky caveats. A person close to talks tells Playbook that the plan is for officials to consolidate the “new deal” into a single body of work. Allies of Starmer insist this is not a U-turn, but plenty in the business world would like it to be. Watch this space.\n\nON MIGRATION: The Times splashes on Labour confirming it would process asylum claims from tens of thousands of small boat migrants who’ve arrived since last July — trapping them in a “perma-backlog.” Labour officials confirmed the details late on Wednesday after facing a tricky grilling in the post-PMQs hacks’ huddle.\n\nLabour view: Party officials argue there is no way the government will manage to fly all these migrants to Rwanda, so the sensible way to deal with their cases is through the asylum system. A Labour spokesperson says: “It would take the Tories over 100 years to send them all to Rwanda.”\n\nTory view: Conservative Chairman Richard Holden said: “Labour now want to introduce a policy that is effectively an advertisement for migrants to come to the U.K.” The party smells electoral advantage here. The Mail splashes on that Home Office photoshoot of the first Rwanda-destined migrants being detained, and its leader column says Sunak “seems to be getting into his stride.”\n\nBookmark this: Meanwhile, despite those briefings to Andrew Marr, Starmer has now ruled out keeping the Rwanda scheme temporarily while Labour sets up a replacement. Sky News clip here.\n\nSAYING THE QUIET PART LOUD: A “senior government figure” tells the Spectator the late timing of the Rwanda bill was deliberate. “The point of doing this stuff pre-locals is to get these debates running,” they say. “We need to keep pressing these bruises.”\n\nSpeaking of pressing bruises: Tories are venting fury at Labour’s Wes Streeting for tweeting that Conservative Susan Hall getting the London mayoralty would be “a win for racists [and] white supremacists.” Ex-PM Liz Truss called it “disgusting.” No word on whether the tweet was approved by Starmer’s office, but Streeting dug in — his team pointing to an ITV scoop that says Cabinet ministers sent support to then-Tory MP Lee Anderson after he said Islamists had control of London Mayor Sadiq Khan.\n\nFight! Fight! Fight! Conservatives have reported Labour to the police in at least two local election battlegrounds, first West Midlands and now Milton Keynes. Tory MP Ben Everitt complained Labour had produced “misleading” campaign literature. Labour accused its rivals of “wasting valuable police time.” GB News wrote it up.\n\nWATCH LIKE A PRO\n\nHOUR BY HOUR: Deep breath, kettle on — here are Playbook’s seats to watch by (approx) time. Thanks to the Local Government Information Unit‘s fab number-crunching, and Playbook’s weary contacts for picking up the phone. Check out PA’s excellent comprehensive list of timings too.\n\nFriday, 1 a.m.: Red-blue Hartlepool symbolized Labour’s nadir in 2021 but now the town hall only needs two more Labour seats for a majority.\n\n2 a.m.: Labour strategists hope to unseat the Tory Avon and Somerset police commissioner, knock Tory Rushmoor into no overall control and make gains in Tory North East Lincolnshire, where Labour ex-MP Melanie Onn is standing in the general. Lib Dems are talking down the odds of taking Portsmouth despite only needing four gains.\n\n3 a.m.: Labour is fighting for control of Harlow (which Starmer visited Wednesday) and Redditch, both Tory but with slim majorities and all seats up for grabs. Labour is also confident of gains on no-overall-control Thurrock, which has long flipped red-blue, went bust and is raising council tax 8 percent. Stockport and Hull are two rare Lib Dem-Labour battles, with each side telling Playbook they’re trying to nab ground off the other. Watch for Reform UK progress in Lincoln, red for most of four decades — but veteran leader Ric Metcalfe, 81, is retiring and Nigel Farage’s party is contesting 11 of 12 seats.\n\n4 a.m.: Between 2 a.m. and 5 a.m. is the Blackpool South by-election result. Red through Blair, Cameron and May then blue in 2019, Labour’s Chris Webb expects to win it back after gambling (um) enthusiast Scott Benton was ousted. But Labour campaigners fear awful turnout, which is low in Blackpool at the best of times (56.8 percent in 2019). Reform UK have claimed they could come second. Reform also has its eye on Labour-run Plymouth, standing in 17 out of 19 seats.\n\n5 a.m. onward: Results dry up until lunchtime and spin wars begin. Ruling Lib Dems hope to strengthen their hold over Tories in Winchester, which has one of their big general election target seats.\n\nFRIDAY, NOON: Tories or Labour will each seize on the Tees Valley mayor to set their narrative if their candidate wins. Labour activists have had jitters about the North East mayor, a shoo-in if not for independent Jamie Driscoll. In council-land, red Blackburn had Labour councillors quit over Gaza, but it shouldn’t swing control of the council. Same deal in Walsall, which is Tory-run but has a Labour target seat at the general.\n\n1 p.m.: Labour aides reckon they’ve a chance of unseating the Tory Nottinghamshire, Humberside, and Cambridgeshire & Peterborough police commissioners. Lib Dems and Labour are neck-and-neck with a strong Green presence in studenty Sheffield, whose Hallam seat is a rare yellow-red Westminster marginal. Labour is gunning hard for the three extra seats it needs for a majority on Cannock Chase, whose Westminster seat is a bellwether since 1997. Burnley is a party rainbow, but watch three wards where Labour is standing against former councillors who quit the party over Starmer’s stance on Gaza.\n\n2 p.m.: Labour expects to win the East Midlands mayor. George Galloway is punching Labour’s Gaza bruise in Rochdale — his Workers Party is fielding 13 candidates. Labour should win back some long-lost ground in Nuneaton & Bedworth and edge ahead of Tories in Hyndburn, a red wall target. Watch for Labour gains in Crawley (a general election target) and Green progress in Tory Solihull. Tories lost control of blue-yellow Brentwood last year, with all seats now up for grabs … and are two seats off losing Basildon, which Michael Gove shamed as an “underperformer.”\n\n3 p. m.: Labour activists reckon they might win the new York & North Yorkshire mayor, an upset in Rishi Sunak’s true-blue back yard. Tories also privately reckon Labour will get the two more seats it needs to control Milton Keynes for the first time in 24 years … and Labour is going for the Tory Bedfordshire and Leicestershire police commissioners. Lib Dems have eyes on the Tory Surrey police commissioner. Labour won Kirklees back in 2022 and will want to strengthen its majority, down to one after councillors quit over Gaza. Labour had Gaza resignations too in no-overall-control Hastings, a Green target.\n\n4 p.m.: Tory strategists will watch line-by-line results in red Wolverhampton and blue Dudley to predict West Midlands Mayor Andy Street’s fate … and that of swing Westminster seats. Dudley hosted Sunak’s locals launch last year, Starmer’s this year, a LabourList profile and even a Playbook visit. Labour will also watch for gains in Westminster target areas Swindon, Pendle and Bury … Adur on the south coast, whose general election seat is a newish target thanks to changing demographics … and on a good night could win back Tamworth after two decades. Labour’s also battling for the Lancashire, Northamptonshire and Cleveland police commissioners.\n\nOver in Lib Dem land: The party reckons it can consolidate recent control of bankrupt Woking, take overall control of Wokingham (Tory MP John Redwood’s back yard) and might even control Tunbridge Wells. Tories would be, well, disgusted.\n\n5 p.m.: Worcester has all seats up for grabs after a Labour-Green coalition … while Labour will want to win back seats it lost from red Rotherham in 2021. Labour lost its majority over Gaza in Oxford, which has 11 candidates for the Independent Oxford Alliance that opposes ULEZ-style traffic measures. Lib Dems are eyeing the Tory Gloucestershire police commissioner, with previous holder Martin Surl running on a yellow ticket to get his old job back.\n\n6 p.m. onward: Watch Bristol for any Green gains at Labour’s expense (despite Labour pointing to an antisemitism row) … and Green gains in Reigate & Banstead, which became the last Surrey council to slip from Tory control in March. “Stevenage Woman” (sigh) will vote in that bellwether, but the council is already red, and Labour is fighting to unseat the police commissioner in Derbyshire, where Sunak launched this year’s campaign. Lib Dems want overall control of Elmbridge (departing local MP: Dominic Raab) and should knock Dorset and Gloucester into no overall control.\n\nSATURDAY AFTERNOON: Mega results for the West Midlands and London mayors set the final narrative in train ahead of the Sunday shows. Greens are duking it out in Stroud and Norwich, where Labour lost control amid infighting in November. Watch how Lib Dems perform for the Hertfordshire police commissioner. Ditto Labour for the Cheshire and Thames Valley police commissioners.\n\nSUNDAY AFTERNOON: A dull final dribble — the Tory Kent and Sussex police commissioners and Labour fiefdom council Salford. And you’re done.\n\nAnd if you want more … There are a ton of other guides, including the BBC, Times, Mirror, Sun, Rallings & Thrasher and PoliticsHome … the FT’s Jen Williams on how the mayors are true devolution made flesh … and Sky’s Beth Rigby comparing Labour’s predicted vote shares to its more resounding 1995 and 1996.\n\nMEANWHILE IN SCOTLAND\n\nWHAT A WEEK! Looks like it’s “sh*t or get off the pot” day for SNP leadership hopefuls John Swinney and Kate Forbes, almost exactly a week after their boss Humza Yousaf accidentally blowtorched his career as first minister. Swinney is making a statement to journalists in Edinburgh at 10.30 a.m. which should confirm whether he’s running.\n\nThe big question: Is whether Forbes joins a Swinney campaign, allowing a coronation and presumably getting a job, or runs too. Much hinges on the private “informal” talks they had on Tuesday.\n\nOr, y’know: Swinney could do a Boris and pull out at the last minute. Just for the laughs.\n\nIf there are 2 candidates: SNP officials confirmed the timetable on Wednesday night for a contest that’d be a couple of weeks shorter than last year’s one. Nominations close at noon on Monday, then the ballot would open on May 13 and close on May 27.\n\nSTOPPED CLOCK WATCH: Labour peer (and ex-shadow Scotland secretary) George Robertson has insisted devolution will still “kill the SNP stone dead,” as he predicted in … err … 1997. “I may well be proved right,” he tells the New Statesman’s Freddie Hayward.\n\nEyes emoji: The Spectator notes that Police Scotland still hasn’t sent a report to the Crown Office about ex-SNP chief exec Peter Murrell, almost a fortnight after he was charged with embezzlement.\n\n**Berlin Playbook, the newest addition to POLITICO’s Playbook family, launched! Täglich informieren wir Sie darüber, was am vor Ihnen liegenden Arbeitstag wirklich zählt. Die aktuellsten Ereignisse aus Kanzleramt, Bundestag und den politischen Zentren der Welt. Mit nur einem Klick anmelden.**\n\nTODAY IN WESTMINSTER\n\nNEARLY THERE: The inquiry into the contaminated blood scandal gives its final report on May 20 — and Jeremy Hunt made a heap of positive noises on Wednesday night. The chancellor told ITV’s Peston plans for compensation will be announced “very shortly” after the report because “the time for talking is over.”\n\nRush of blood: ITV News’s Carl Dinnen hears some victims have now been told they can apply for compensation “soon.” Playbook was previously told that officials, who talk of a possible £10 billion bill (and past reports put it at double that), think ministers are likely to accept the inquiry’s recommendations and set out next steps.\n\nBut but but … Actually paying such huge sums will be both a logistical epic and a big dent to stretched finances. Hunt insisted that as a one-off payment, it won’t have an ongoing impact on public spending. But he stopped short of committing to pay out before the election. Instead he told LBC: “I want to do it.”\n\nCOPS OUT: No, Irish police officers won’t be deployed to the border with the U.K., deputy PM Micheál Martin told Northern Ireland Secretary Chris Heaton-Harris Wednesday night. The spat over migrants crossing from the U.K. into Ireland slow-burned for a week before Rishi Sunak talked about it at PMQs. It splashes the Telegraph, which (despite Dublin’s best efforts) has the headline: “Ireland sends police to border.”\n\nLet’s ask him: POLITICO’s Ireland Correspondent Shawn Pogatchnik emails to say the whole issue is overblown. Shawn says the kind of spot checks officers will be doing are only on public transport … have happened since 2004 … most of the 100 officers will stay at desks in Dublin … and their deployment will be introduced over a year.\n\nTHE GUY JUST LOVES CRICKET: Rishi Sunak did a 23-minute interview with Asian station Sunrise Radio, in which he was asked his “proudest achievement and moment” in his political career … and said bowling with the England cricket team in the No. 10 garden. (He then added planning law changes and funds for disabled toilets.)\n\nBIG BORDER PROBLEM: Ministers including David Cameron and James Cleverly have raised concerns with their French counterparts that the EU’s new border system from October could cause chaos, reports the Telegraph’s Ben Riley-Smith. Delays to the EU’s smartphone app have long caused jitters (as our own Jon Stone noted in March) and legal migration minister Tom Pursglove now reckons it won’t be ready in time (via the Times).\n\nDISCIPLINE PROBLEM: Labour Chief of Staff Sue Gray has stuck prisons at the top of a “risk register” of potential “black swan” events, says Katy Balls’ Times column. Balls asks after the missing-in-action Sentencing Bill that will cut overcrowding … but annoy Tory MPs.\n\nSCOOP — DON’T CALL ME, DAVE: Thought David Cameron’s plea in the U.S. for Ukraine cash went down badly? Elbridge Colby, one of the ex-officials tipped as a possible national security adviser if Donald Trump regains the White House, tells POLITICO’s Power Play podcast it was “astounding” … “foreign interference” … “the height of audacity for such a person to be coming and lecturing us.”\n\nLabour will love this: Colby says Shadow Foreign Secretary (and Democrats’ pal) David Lammy “is laying out a more compatible vision” and says Sunak’s big defense spending pledge is “fake accounting trickery” (which Tories hotly denied when Labour said similar). Write-up here.\n\nI’M SORRY: Newly ex-Tory MP Mark Menzies of “bad people” fame has said he is “deeply sorry” for his “mistakes,” writing in the Lancashire Post that he’s faced “personal challenges,” including being a carer for his 89-year-old mother with dementia.\n\nCARTEL OF COMPLACENCY NEWS: The OECD’s economic outlook is out at 8 a.m.\n\nSTATS DUMP: Out at 9.30 a.m. are statistics from the Ministry of Justice on conviction rates … plus pupil attendance … social care occupancy … and cinema box office takings.\n\nSIX WEEKS ON: Ministers still haven’t met the author of a March report calling for compensation to women who had their state pension age pushed back, says a written answer spotted by the i’s Jane Merrick.\n\nCOP OUT: Graham Stuart was “furious” at flying home from Dubai’s COP28 climate summit to vote on Rwanda in December, the recently resigned climate minister told my colleague Charlie Cooper. Though he backs Sunak more than ex-PM Liz Truss — who he says is talking about net zero in “language designed for U.S. talk shows.” Ouch. Full interview for subscribers of POLITICO’s Morning Energy and Climate UK newsletter.\n\nIDENTITY PARADE: The battle over Financial Conduct Authority plans to “name and shame” firms it’s investigating rumbles on. Tory peer (and ex-Treasury Committee chair) Andrew Tyrie has told the Times he’s on the FCA’s side. Chancellor Jeremy Hunt is against. And Shadow Chancellor Rachel Reeves hasn’t yet revealed her cards, my colleagues James Fitzgerald and Zachary Warmbrodt write today.\n\nREPORT OUT TODAY: The Public Administration and Constitutional Affairs Committee says WhatsApp for government use “should be subject to the same disclosure” as face-to-face meetings.\n\nHOUSE OF COMMONS: Sits from 9.30 a.m. with business and trade questions, followed by business questions … a motion on security in the Western Balkans (led by Conservative MP Alicia Kearns) … and a debate on pension schemes (Liberal Democrat MP Alistair Carmichael). DUP MP Jim Shannon has the adjournment debate on the Kingsmill massacre inquest.\n\nWESTMINSTER HALL: Debates from 12.30 p.m. on pylons and the National Grid (led by Conservative MP Matt Warman) … and the contribution of volunteers (Conservative MP Jo Gideon and Labour MP Mary Kelly Foy).\n\nHOUSE OF LORDS: Sits from 11 a.m. with questions including an NHS social media post about ovarian cancer that didn’t use the word “women,” and missing asylum seekers … a debate on the Economic Affairs Committee report “Making an Independent Bank of England Work Better” (led by Conservative peer George Bridges) … a short debate on U.K.-EU trade of food and agricultural products (Conservative peer Anne McIntosh) … and a debate on the Public Services Committee report “Homecare Medicines Services: An Opportunity Lost” (Labour peer Estelle Morris).\n\nBEYOND THE M25\n\nSPARKS WILL FLY: Conservative MPs Jeremy Quin, Crispin Blunt, Tom Tugendhat, Andrew Griffith, Mims Davies and Greg Clark are among those due to speak at a planning hearing today into Gatwick Airport’s plan for a new runway, per the Sussex Express.\n\nORDERS TO RUSSIA: Foreign Minister Nusrat Ghani met on Wednesday with the wife of jailed Russian-British political activist Vladimir Kara-Murza, who Ghani said Russia must release “immediately on humanitarian grounds for urgent medical treatment.”\n\nSENEDD IT BACK: Labour members voted down a Tory bid to hold an independent investigation into Welsh First Minister Vaughan Gething’s £200,000 donation from a man prosecuted for illegally dumping waste. Labour former minister Lee Waters told the BBC Gething should pay it back.\n\nHARD STEER: A European Commission probe into Chinese subsidies for electric vehicles is “advancing” and next steps are due by July, EU trade chief Valdis Dombrovskis has told our pals over at Brussels Playbook.\n\nDOESN’T HE WANT AN INVITE BACK? Speaking at a campaign rally in Wisconsin, Former President Donald Trump has said London has “opened its doors to jihad” and become “unrecognizable,” saying “we can’t let that happen here and I’ll never let it happen.”\n\nARIZONA ABORTION NEWS: Lawmakers in Arizona repealed an abortion ban that dates back to 1864. Now, Democrats are concerned that as the outrage fades, election turnout may too, reports my colleague Megan Messerly.\n\nRUSSIA USING CHEMICAL WEAPONS IN UKRAINE, U.S. SAYS: The U.S. on Wednesday accused Russia of violating the international chemical weapons ban by using chloropicrin (which German forces deployed in World War I) against Ukrainian troops. CNN has a write-up.\n\nGAZA LATEST: After meeting with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken said he could not support an assault on Rafah as he has still not seen a plan to protect civilians during the offensive. Britain says similar.\n\n**A message from Lloyds Banking Group: Currently, over 8.5 million people in the UK cannot access the housing they need, including over 250,000 families and individuals that are experiencing homelessness.
