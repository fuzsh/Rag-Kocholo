        "text": "In that time, the Conservative Party has tried everything.\n\nThe political landscape has changed, changed utterly, and the evidence points to a government facing a heavy, perhaps catastrophic electoral defeat later this year.\n\nWhether you like Rishi Sunak or not, he is sinking badly, and with some sections of the electorate, his ratings are even worse than those of his predecessor. “Worse than Truss” is not a position in which anyone should find themselves.\n\nStay up-to-date with the latest Politics news\n\nJoin us on WhatsApp\n\nOur community members are treated to special offers, promotions, and adverts from us and our partners.

More info\n\nThe narrative of choice for Tory optimists in 2023 was that the path to victory was “steep and narrow”.\n\nThe crumbs of consolation were mainly to be found in the astonishing inability of Sir Keir Starmer to endear himself at all to voters.\n\nHe outpolls Rishi Sunak, yet he still is rated as “the best prime minister” by less than a third of those surveyed.\n\nFor Sunak this is icy-cold comfort. Starmer is like the man in the field who does not have to run faster than the bull: he only needs to run faster than Sunak.\n\nOne of them will be prime minister after the election, and there is no reason, none at all, to think that it will be Rishi Sunak.\n\nSir Simon Clarke, a former cabinet minister so forgettable he must struggle with his iPhone’s facial recognition, announced this week that the prime minister should step down to avoid a “massacre”.\n\n“He does not get what Britain needs. And he is not listening to what the British people want.”\n\nThe lanky Middlesbrough MP was excoriated.\n\nIn fact, in the topsy-turvy world of contemporary politics, he is Schrödinger’s Rebel: he is simultaneously right and wrong.\n\nInvalid email\n\nWe use your sign-up to provide content in ways you've consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

Read our Privacy Policy\n\nAny Conservative who can still perceive that Downfall was not a motivational story knows that defeat is very likely, and that Sunak is not the beginning and end of the problem.\n\nThe prime minister struggles hopelessly to seem human and in touch: worse, he often fails even to be vaguely likeable.\n\nBut the government is tired.\n\nIf you can, think back to July 2022.\n\nEight candidates put themselves forward to succeed Boris Johnson, and Conservative MPs voted five times in eight days to narrow that field to two, Sunak and Truss, who were then put before the party membership.\n\nSunak actually led until it finally mattered, but in the fifth round, Liz Truss outscored Penny Mordaunt by only eight votes.\n\nConservative Home’s polling suggested Mordaunt was the rank and file’s first choice.\n\nSince then Mordaunt has been leader of the House of Commons, and she has done the job well.\n\nHer weekly appearances at the despatch box are poised and punchy, she is light on her feet and actually seems to enjoy getting to grips with her opponents.\n\nAs a state-educated first-generation graduate from a Service family, she is dogged neither by Sunak’s off-the-scale privilege nor Truss’s off-the-scale oddness.\n\nLast summer, this paper found she was the most popular member of an unpopular cabinet.\n\nREAD MORE Top EU judge ‘compares Rishi Sunak to Putin’ as Rwanda showdown looms\n\nAt this stage, a choice among Mordaunt, Sunak and Truss would strike many as straightforward.\n\nMordaunt is a full paid-up member of the human race: unfussy, practical, funny.\n\nShe can use a contactless debit card and has no obvious interest in pork markets.\n\nBut there is no vacancy, and Simon Clarke seemed at first to have proved there was little appetite for forcing one.\n\nThen WhatsApp began to crackle. A message has emerged proposing that Sunak should go, that “the only possible game changer\" is “a [Newt] Gingrich-style '100 Day Contract with Britain’”; that Mordaunt is drafted into the leadership on the simple promise of an imminent general election, imitating the Republicans’ dramatic bounceback in the 1994 congressional mid-terms.\n\nRemember those numbers from July 2022. Sunak/Truss/Mordaunt. 137/113/105.\n\nIf you were choosing now, it would be hard to argue that Sunak or Truss was the ticket to success. But that was then. This is now. And there is no vacancy."
