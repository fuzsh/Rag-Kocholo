With the Manchester City case expected to finally have an outcome by April, that potentially seismic decision hangs over the entirety of the new season, which is due to start on Friday. Masters kept his stance of refusing to discuss any element of it, other than to say \\\"of course we contemplate at its conclusion what might happen and we think about that a lot\\\".\n\nThe Independent\n\nScandal-hit Japan PM quits\n\nFumio Kishida has announced he will step down as Japan's prime minister after three years in office marred by political scandals, saying his exit is \\\"what is best for the public\\\".\n\nThe Independent\n\nHere come the girls... and a challenge for Donald Trump\n\nHailey Guerra had never bothered to attend a presidential campaign rally before now - but Kamala Harris's visit to the Desert Diamond Arena in Glendale seemed different.\n\nThe Independent\n\nFears of new fires as Athens counts cost of climate crisis\n\nFirefighters battled yesterday to extinguish the final pockets of a wildfire near Athens that killed a woman and forced thousands of people to flee their homes.
