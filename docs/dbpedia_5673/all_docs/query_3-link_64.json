        "text": "Boris Johnson was expected to resign as prime minister today - finally giving in to the pressure of high-profile government resignations . It is believed that Mr Johnson has agreed to stand down, with a new Tory leader set to be in place by the time of the party’s conference in October.\n\nWith thoughts turning to his successor, Penny Mordaunt has emerged as a shock favourite to take over as Prime Minister. The Trade Minister, who is MP for Portsmouth North, is being described by Tory sources as the ‘unity’ candidate who has strength and traction in the party.\n\nAnd today Ms Mordaunt became the bookies' favourite to replace Mr Johnson . Ladbrokes had her as 9/2 to take over as PM - ahead of ex-Chancellor Rishi Sunak at 13/2.\n\nRead more: Seven announcements from Boris Johnson resignation speech as he quits as PM\n\nWho is Penny Mordaunt?\n\nMs Mordaunt has been Portsmouth North’s MP for 12 years after being elected in May 2010. She currently holds the Government post of Minister of State for Trade Policy - a job she has held since last year.\n\nThe 49-year-old was born in Torquay, Devon, in 1973 - one of twins. Her father, John Mordaunt, served in the Parachute Regiment before retiring to become a teacher and she was named after the Royal Navy cruiser HMS Penelope.\n\nShe has two brothers - twin James and Edward, who is younger - while on her mother Jennifer’s side she is related to the politician Philip Snowden, who became the first Labour Chancellor of the Exchequer in 1924. She went to Oaklands Catholic Academy, in Waterlooville, Hampshire, and studied drama at the Victory-Land Theatre School in Portsmouth.\n\nWhen Ms Mordaunt was 15, her mother died of breast cancer. In March 2019, Ms Mourdant tweeted: “Monday is my birthday. I will have reached the same age as my Mum was when she died of breast cancer. #BreastScreening saves lives, please make sure you make use of the service.”\n\nMs Mordaunt paid her way through sixth-form college by becoming a magician’s apprentice and went on to study philosophy at the University of Reading.\n\nShe was the first member of her family to go to university and, while there, she became active in student politics - serving as president of the Reading University Students' Union.\n\nPenny Mordaunt’s political career\n\nAfter graduating, Ms Mordaunt began working in public relations. She became Head of Youth for the Conservative Party under Prime Minister John Major before taking the role of Head of Broadcasting under Tory leader William Hague.\n\nShe then worked in communications for several years before becoming a director for the Big Lottery Fund and charity Diabetes UK.\n\nIn 2003, she was selected as the Conservative candidate to contest Portsmouth North in the 2005 general election - losing to Labour candidate Sarah McCarthy-Fry by 1,139 votes. After the election, she worked as chief of staff for David Willetts' aborted leadership campaign.\n\nShe was selected again to contest Portsmouth North for the 2010 general election - winning the seat from Labour with a 7,289 majority. After working as Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Decentralisation from 2014 to 2015, she became the first woman to be appointed Minister of State for the Armed Forces in 2015.\n\nShe became better known outside of Westminster in 2014 after appearing in ITV show Splash!, when she joined celebrities to be trained in diving by Olympian Tom Daley. She was the ninth contestant out of 20 to be eliminated from the programme after mistiming a back somersault.\n\nIn 2017, Ms Mordaunt was appointed Secretary of State for International Development after Priti Patel resigned over her unauthorised meetings with Israeli officials while on holiday. A year later, she became Minister for Women and Equalities - replacing Amber Rudd, who resigned over the Windrush scandal.\n\nAnd in May 2019 she was appointed the first-ever female Secretary of State for Defence following Gavin Williamson’s sacking over a leak from a top-level National Security Council meeting about Chinese telecommunications company Huawei. Ms Mordaunt left Government in 2019 after Boris Johnson became Prime Minister but returned shortly after in a cabinet reshuffle - succeeding Oliver Dowden as Paymaster General in the Cabinet Office.\n\nIn yet another reshuffle in 2021, she was made Minister of State for Trade Policy. In the EU membership referendum, Ms Mordaunt supported Brexit.\n\nIn a speech last year, she said: “Brexit is not an event to be mourned by the international community. Or an act of self-harm or one that requires us to be punished.\n\n“It is a massive opportunity to anyone who believes in democracy and the power of trade as a force for good in the world.”\n\nIs Penny Mordaunt married?\n\nMs Mordaunt met and married Paul Murray in 1999 when they were mature students at Reading University - but they divorced a year later. She was later in a relationship with classical singer Ian Lyon, although it has been reported that they split in 2016.\n\nRead next:"
