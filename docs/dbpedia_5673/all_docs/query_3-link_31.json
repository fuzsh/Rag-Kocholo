        "text": "Penny Mordaunt launches campaign video\n\nPenny Mordaunt, who currently serves as Leader of the House of Commons, has put herself forward to become the next Tory leader and UK Prime Minister after Liz Truss sensationally quit after just 44 days in office.\n\nBut unlike other well-known potential candidates like Rishi Sunak, Ms Mordaunt is relatively unknown to the British public. Express Politics has put together a simple guide on everything you need to know about the Tory rising star as she launches her bid for Prime Minister.\n\nREAD MORE: Rishi Sunak is first contender to pass 100 Tory MP threshold\n\nWho is Penny Mordaunt?\n\nMs Mordaunt is the MP for Portsmouth North and has represented the constituency since 2010. Serving as Minister for Trade Policy since 2021, she has held several cabinet positions in her time as a politician, including Minister for Defence, Minister for Equalities and as Paymaster General.\n\nBorn in Devon in 1973, Ms Mordaunt is the daughter of a former paratrooper and special needs teacher and has a twin brother.\n\nShe is distantly related to the late Angela Lansbury, who is her grandmother’s cousin, and she is therefore also distantly related to former Labour leader George Lansbury.\n\nThe family moved to Portsmouth, where she now serves as MP, when she was young and once recalled watching soldiers set off for the Falklands, saying: \"It taught me that my country stands up to bullies.\"\n\nWhen she was just 15, her mother died from breast cancer , leaving her to help bring up her siblings. Her father was also diagnosed with cancer the following year.\n\nShe told the Sunday Times in 2019: \"It was pretty relentless in terms of stresses and losing a parent, you're trying to deal with all of that and study, run a house, look after two brothers.\"\n\nShe was married to Paul Murray, whom she met at university, but they divorced only one year after they wed in 1999. Ms Mordaunt was later in a relationship with classical singer Ian Lyon, whom she reportedly split from in 2016.\n\nUnlike many MPs, Ms Mordaunt lives near her constituency in Portsmouth, on the South Coast of England. It is understood that she lives alone, though she has previously shared her feline companion ‘Moggs’ on her Instagram page.\n\nInvalid email\n\nWe use your sign-up to provide content in ways you've consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

Read our Privacy Policy\n\nInside her education\n\nMs Mordaunt attended a state school in Hampshire and later studied drama at a theatre school.\n\nThe first member of her family to attend university studied philosophy at the University of Reading and graduated in 1995 with a 2:1.\n\nDuring her student years, she was active in the political scene and was President of the Reading University Student’s Union.\n\nShortly after her studies ended, she became involved with the Conservative party.\n\nHer employment history\n\nUnder John Major, she was president of Youth for the Conservative party and went on to work as head of broadcasting under party leader William Hague.\n\nThe party leader hopeful has a colourful employment background, having worked in a factory, as a magician's assistant, and in an orphanage in Romania.\n\nShe even worked as head of foreign press on former American President George W Bush’s 2000 campaign.\n\nThe now Portsmouth North MP first contested the seat in the 2005 general election, but despite securing a 5.5 percent swing, she lost out to Labour. She eventually won the seat in 2010, securing an 8.4 percent swing from Labour.\n\nMore recently, Ms Mordaunt has supported the 2016 leave campaign and is a Royal Navy Reserve.\n\nFour fast facts on Penny Mordaunt\n\nIn 2014 gave a speech on \"poultry welfare\" after a dare by her navy training officers which involved saying \"a particular word, the abbreviation of cockerel, several times during a speech on the floor\".\n\nShe is a navy reservist and was appointed the UK's first-ever female defence secretary by Theresa May\n\nFormer Brexit minister Lord Frost once said that \"sometimes I didn't even know where she was\" during Brexit negotiations.\n\nIn 2014, she appeared on ITV competition show Splash! where she was mentored on diving by Tom Daley.\n\nInside her voting record\n\nPenny Mordaunt, 49, has navigated plenty of political turmoil in the 12 years she's served as a Member of Parliament, seeing through four prime ministers. She remained in cabinet under Theresa May to make her support for Brexit felt and stayed away from controversy during Boris Johnson's scandal-ridden time in power.\n\nBut now it seems she thinks she's ready for her own turn in No 10, something Sir Keir Starmer joked about this week saying: \"I guess under this Tory government, everybody gets to be prime minister for 15 minutes.\"\n\nOn transport: She has consistently voted for higher taxes on plane tickets and in favour of new high speed rail infrastructure, but voted against slowing the rise in rail fares and a publicly owned rail system.\n\nOn the environment: Ms Mordaunt has a mixed record on environmental issues, voting both for and against the use of fracking, though has \"ghenerall voted against measures to prevent climate change\" according to TheyWorkForYou, with 8 votes for and 21 votes against.\n\nHer views on the NHS: She has \"almost always voted for reforming the NHS so GPs buy services on behalf of their patients\".\n\nOn defence: A Navy Reservist, she has a firm stance on foreign policy and military issues, voting in favour of the use of British armed forces and for replacing Trident with a new nuclear weapons system.\n\nOn education: She has consistently voted for university tuition fees, as well as for greater autonomy for schools.\n\nHer views on home affairs: She has consistently supported mass surveillance of people’s communications and activities, for a stricter asylum system, and for stronger enforcement of immigration rules.\n\nOn taxes: Ms Mordaunt has \"generally voted against a banker’s bonus tax\" and against increasing the tax rate applied to income over £150,000, but voted for more restrictive regulation of trade union activity and for increasing the rate of VAT.\n\nHer views on LGBT issues: She has consistently voted for equal gay rights but against laws to promote equality and human rights.\n\nAs equalities minister, she faced some fury over her views and comments regarding transgender communities. She later rowed back on her statements, saying: \"If you've been in the Royal Navy, and you have competed physically against men, you understand the biological difference between men and women\"."
