        "text": "It might seem like a trifling point, compared to the heavy hitting policies and the small matter of the future of the country, but what Keir Starmer and Rishi Sunak choose to wear on the campaign trail is weighted with meaning.\n\nImage is everything in politics – see the damage done by that bacon sandwich when Ed Miliband was running a decade ago – so how politicians present themselves can make all the difference.\n\nRecall how Sir Winston Churchill cemented his statesman grandeur in siren suits and Homburg hats, or how Barack Obama gained broad appeal by looking approachable, contemporary and relevant in a tan J Crew suit.\n\nHere’s what the pair - and other politicians of note - have been seen wearing recently.\n\nJune 7\n\nPenny Mordaunt’s ‘Texan blow-dry’\n\nPenny Mordaunt has raised her hair game for the BBC election debate - quite literally.\n\nThe Leader of the House of Commons’ blonde, shoulder-length hair was styled with such a remarkable amount of volume, it has drawn some comparisons with the late Margaret Thatcher’s signature look.\n\nIn a line-up of individuals skilled at making themselves stand out, Mordaunt set herself apart, and her hair will have helped achieve that.\n\nIf it seems a little ridiculous to go quite so far with the backcombing and hairspray, consider the circumstances: hair, like makeup, must be exaggerated for a photo shoot or television appearance. All the men participating will have likely had a little face powder applied at the very least. Then there’s the ‘drop’ factor - Mordaunt’s stylist will have styled it higher than necessary, because the hair will drop down a little over the course of the debate.\n\nIt is a look that the celebrity world has embraced too. So-called ‘Texan hair’ (where they like to say, “the higher the hair, the closer to God”) is back in style; Hannah Waddingham, Beyonce and Miley Cyrus have all championed it.\n\nSince her participation in the King’s Coronation last year, Mordaunt has established a reputation for a polished, elegant appearance, which, let’s face it, is rare in British politics.\n\nShe may face some social media ribbing for her Texan blow-dry, but it was sleek, her makeup was excellent, and the navy suit with a blue silk top, strong, if literal, messaging.\n\nShe wasn’t the only literal dresser. With Labour Deputy Leader Angela Rayner in a red puff-sleeved Ted Baker dress, and Green Party Co-Leader Carla Denyer in, you guessed it, green, even the most disengaged viewers had no trouble establishing who represented which party.\n\nWell, three of the seven party representatives at least. If it wasn’t literal, it was hot pink. We can forgive Daisy Cooper for steering clear of Liberal Democrat mustard, that’s a hard colour to carry off, and fuchsia looks more impactful on television.\n\nNigel Farage, a man so devoted to literal dressing that he owns Union Jack shoes, missed a Reform turquoise opportunity, instead wearing a purple and fuchsia patterned tie; Plaid Cymru’s Rhun ap Iorwerth opted for a pink tie too. The SNP’s Stephen Flynn clearly failed to get any of the colour memos, but at least his tie was fashionably slim, which is something.\n\nJune 6\n\nCorbyn smartens up his act\n\nJeremy Corbyn’s appearance at Islington Town Hall to announce his decision to stand as an independent candidate in the borough, was eye-raising for several reasons. For one, he was flanked by comedian Rob Delaney. Secondly, the former Labour leader has sharpened up his image in recent years.\n\nGone is the ramshackle, ‘down the allotment’ look - a defiantly anti-corporate stance that was taken as a deliberate move in 2019 to appeal to his Corbynite followers - and in its place a sleeker appearance; the kind of neat, button-down collar shirt, sky blue blazer (note the colour; non-corporate still) and tasseled loafers that would be entirely on point for any Islington dinner party. Will the reinvention re-ignite his political career?\n\nJune 4\n\nThe Starmer sweep\n\nOh dear, it really did take a drenching, didn’t it? It’s been a particularly grey summer, and Rishi Sunak didn’t help his cause in choosing to announce the general election outside Downing Street in a torrential downpour.\n\nYou can see what they were going for – a kind of dramatic, graphic novel noir to underline the seriousness of the moment – but Sunak looked defeated before he had started. It’s become one of the most enduring political image of recent years.\n\nAs for the suit – which is likely courtesy of his Bloomsbury tailor Henry Herbert, costing upwards of £3000 – we hope it’s found salvation at a Westminster dry cleaners.\n\nMay 3\n\nKeir Starmer’s black jacket"
