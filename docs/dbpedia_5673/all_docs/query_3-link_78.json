        "text": "Ken Clarke has just popped up on Radio 4's flagship Today programme to put a characteristically cheerful – and loyal – gloss on David Cameron's cabinet reshuffle in which the ex-future Tory leader finally stepped down after a ministerial career spanning a remarkable 42 years. \"We'll have you back,\" said Today's Justin Webb. I bet they will.\n\nEven the hypocritical, brain-damaged tabloids that wasted time and energy trying to drive him from office, regret his passing, as will we all. There are few politicians of the front rank who still sound both sane and humane after so many decades at Westminster – Clarke was first elected in Ted Heath's unexpected election win in June 1970 – let alone at 75.\n\nThat said, any reshuffle is a game of two halves and we must await the names of those Cameron is promoting to replace what critics of the Anglo-American literary canon used to dismiss (unfairly) as \"dead, white males\" (DWMs) who have been culled by No 10. But so far so mostly bad. Let's hope the prime minister surprises and delights us later in the day. Michael Gove to leave education, eh? That's a better start.\n\nBut half-time disappointment does not rest on gender balance, or even on the Eurosceptic tilt we can expect to emerge. We can overdo both obsessions, Clarke told Radio 4 listeners in an interview that revealed a hitherto quiescent feminism in the old bruiser. It is a development we may attribute to his unflashy, formidable wife, Gillian, whom I once watched drinking claret and smoking cheroots with Ken.\n\nNo, the problem is brains and experience. New and promoted ministers can and will bring brains enough to the table, though the sackees include some pretty smart DWMs – starting with Clarke QC himself and William Hague (too brainy for his own good?) They also include in Dominic Grieve and David Willetts to whom – in a mischievous moment years ago – I first attributed the nickname \"Two Brains\". It was not meant to do him harm.\n\nHere's Rowena Mason's mini-profile article, which of necessity misses some significant names in the full list of the fallen, found here. Andrew Lansley, long on death row since his health reform train crash, is out – as he should be, a decent man but a bad politician.\n\nGone too is Sir George Young – almost as old as Clarke and probably delighted to retire (again). He is the only minister sacked by Mrs T and brought back by her too. Alan Duncan is leaving Dfid, a sharp fellow (I wanted out, he says, as does Willetts), as is Nick Hurd (what is a minister for civil society?), Douglas Hurd's son's ministerial career ending sooner than dad would wish.\n\nWhat most – not all – of these ex-ministers have is what the new ministers will lack: experience. Most have been in or around politics a long time (Grieve's father was an MP too), Willetts ran Thatcher's favourite thinktank, the Centre for Policy Studies, Duncan was a worldly oil trader with a streak of idealism who has been trying to make Bangladeshi garment factories safer places. OK, I know, it's fashionable to say – actually, it usually is – that Westminster is too full of professional politicians, of insiders with little experience of our old pal, the real world.\n\nThere's some truth in this, though I should point out that Ken Bloke – whom the Sun and Mail praise – was first elected at 29. He was a mere boy, though older than Tony Benn, another \"real world\" hero who was just 25 and a BBC radio producer when picked to become an MP in 1950. As for William Hague, I was in the Empress ballroom in Blackpool – everyone's favourite conference hall – when he precociously entered politics at 16 by lecturing Mrs T on how to govern when she won the coming election.\n\nPersonally, I still think he never recovered from that debut – as Judy Garland once told the Queen Mother about Somewhere over the Rainbow: \"Ma'am, that song ruined my life.\" But Hague certainly rose too far too fast: party leader at 36, and ex-leader at 40. My sense is that the fire went out then and that's he been doing his duty by more successful (but less clever) successors ever since. What he acquired in the process is experience of life, with all its disappointments and insights.\n\nYou can't fake experience and the perspectives it brings. Class of 2010 MPs in cabinet is a bit scary. Though I find it hard to forgive Hague his role in taking the Tories out of the Euro-Tory group in the European parliament (the EPP), one of the stupidest things Cameron has done, his departure is a loss – and he is only 53. He will become leader of the Commons, itself a much diminished job, and he will be good at it, then retire at the election. But it's over.\n\nWe'll wait and see how the reshuffle looks when it's over before becoming too alarmed about its Farage-appeasing tilt. Grieve's departure is alarming for more than Euro-reasons. He was rare among ministers, especially Chris Grayling who is inexperienced and impulsive at justice, in having a proper feel for the proprieties of the law, even prosecuting newspapers that breached neglected sub-judice rules.\n\nCautious and judicious, his resistance to the populist anti-human rights campaign in the Tory ranks may have been what did for Grieve. Let's wait and see before passing judgment. At least Phil Hammond, set to move from defence, where he did well, to the Foreign Office, is no populist. Dull and decent, he could fairly be called an unpopulist.\n\nLast word for now to Clarke. It's a good thing to have few reshuffles (coalition dynamics have forced that on Cameron) but also good to reshape your team before an election, said Clarke. \"My time to go had come. No British government will ever want to take us out of the EU, which protects our interests and projects our influence.\" Are you sure, Ken? He added that it would be unthinkable to leave the human rights convention that protects us from our own over-mighty state. Reform is possible.\n\nAll sensible and optimistic, a fresh reminder of how foolish his party was to reject him as their leader – the Tory Denis Healey – \"Take me as you find me, I have plenty of other things to do with my life.\" But what struck me in the Today interview was the old codger's sensitivity to the changing world of work. At a recent meeting between his own and eastern European officials and ministers he had noticed that \"I was the only man in the room. My female colleagues have had that experience all their working lives.\"\n\nWell done there, Ken. But don't forget to do the ironing before you slip off to the cricket."
