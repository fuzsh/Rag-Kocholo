This partnership isn't just about branding; it's about elevating the sport to new heights and driving its growth and development across the country. I believe this partnership is remarkable here's why- Increased Visibility: Coca-Cola is a globally recognized brand, and its association with Cricket Canada will undoubtedly increase the visibility of the sport. With Coca-Cola's extensive reach and marketing prowess, cricket will reach a broader audience beyond traditional cricket-playing communities Investment in Infrastructure and Development: Partnerships like this come with financial support that can be channelled into grassroots development programs, infrastructure improvement, and talent identification initiatives.

Amul and Nandini, two of India's largest dairy brands, are sponsoring foreign teams in the ICC T20 World Cup 2024. Amul sponsors the USA and South Africa teams, while Nandini backs Ireland and Scotland. Here's why: 1. Global Exposure: These sponsorships provide international visibility and help expand their global market presence. 2. Cost-Effective: Sponsoring foreign teams is cheaper than sponsoring the Indian team, making it a cost-effective marketing strategy. 3. Market Penetration: It helps brands like Amul, which recently launched fresh milk in the USA, to tap into new markets. 4. Brand Building: Associating with an international sports event enhances brand image and recognition. However, this strategy isn't without challenges, including potential disconnect with the domestic market and financial risks if the expected ROI doesn't materialize. Amul and Nandini's moves reflect a strategic blend of cost management and global ambition, leveraging cricket's global appeal to boost their brands. #valuation #linkedn #finance\n\nWhat did I learn from yesterday‚Äôs match? ‚Ä¢ Trolling is easy; silent support is not. ‚Ä¢ Judgments are easy; patience is not. ‚Ä¢ Mocking is easy; understanding is not. ‚Ä¢ Commenting on others is easy; trusting others is not. ‚Ä¢ Celebrating is easy; gratitude is not. ‚Ä¢ Winning is easy; being with someone without judgments is not. ‚Ä¢ Throwing your emotions (positive or negative) is easy; keeping your nerves in place is not. Some things in life remain beautifully unexplained‚Äîperfect catches, perfect timings. What a match, what a catch! Let's hope we Indians hold onto these lessons. The prayers of countless Indians, combined with the team's hard work, led to our victory. Although I don‚Äôt enjoy watching sports so much, I‚Äôm learning to respect all careers. I hope we, as Indians, nurture the same passion and respect for all sports‚Äîboth men‚Äôs and women‚Äôs‚Äîand all careers. Cricket is an emotion, but we must learn to treat cricketers as human beings who can and must be allowed to make mistakes. Just as we prematurely declared South Africa the winner in the middle of the match, we too can err. May we never forget these lessons. Pallavi.\n\nCricket's Surging Rise in Canada: An Irresistible Opportunity for Brands in the Evolving Sports Landscape In the wake of cricket's exponential surge across Canada, its dynamic and passionate fan base, and the sense of community it fosters, brands are offered an unparalleled chance to embed themselves within the very essence of this burgeoning sports culture.

Those in the sports business trade will know how much time and effort is spent conceptualizing, negotiating and launching these partnerships. A special thanks goes out to the folks who have had the patience to learn the sport (‚Äúyou mean people will sit around for 8 hours watching ONE game?!?‚Äù‚Ä¶to which the answer is an easy yes), understand its potential and work with us tirelessly over the last several months to put together a long-term vision that we are incredibly excited about. Equally, it must be recognized this is not just a result of commercial stakeholders doubling down on Canadian cricket. This is a result of the sacrifices made by players and coaches, who travel across the world to remote destinations and juggle the demands of their professional careers and family life, who are now about to play on Cricket‚Äôs biggest global stage in June. A result of the relentless volunteer work by administrators across the country who give all their free time to steward the sport towards a bright future. And, a result of a growing commercial platform that now gives Canada‚Äôs largest brands an opportunity to tap into the steep growth trajectory of our sport. We cannot be more excited for this partnership to take cricket to new heights in Canada. https://lnkd.in/gXyGWHAQ\n\nRepresenting Australia in your chosen sport, is there a greater honour? If your sport is Australian Rules Football, how often does an opportunity like this come along? It isn't everyday you get to take to the footy field with the current AFL Games Record Holder, and a 4 time Premiership Player and Norm Smith Medalist. And how often does the chance to be coached by the greatest visionary of the modern era of the game of AFL come up? One thing that attributes value to something is it's rarity. Who do you know that would treasure this October Croatia Tour opportunity?
