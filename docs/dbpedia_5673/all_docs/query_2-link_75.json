        "text": "Hilary Robertson writes:\n\n\"My Father Alan Robertson was at the Institute until 1938. There are more details about him on Wikipedia. The correction I would like, please, relates to the photo of the cricket team circa 1937 to 1939: I have a very similar one of the team but with the umpire (white coat and trilby, possibly a master?) rather than the headmaster. There are signatures on it, none of which contradict the photo on the site, except that the boy on the far left of the front row is my father, Alan Robertson, and not Bill Thomas as shown. In addition, given that he went to Cambridge in the autumn of 1938, I believe that the team cannot date from as late as 1939. (Later on, in letters home which I have just been reading, he talks of playing for the Liobians team.)\"\n\n(The 1937 Green Book credits A. Robertson, I.R. Stewart, P.U. Rumjahn, E.J. Rumjahn and F.A. Mellors with full colours, so this almost certainly is the 1938 season. Robertson and Stewart have half-colours in the 1936 Green Book and are not listed in 1938. Fred.)\n\nBack Row\n\nMorgan - 2 - 3 - K. Hughes - W. H. (Bill) Adams - George Wass\n\nFront Row\n\nAlan Robertson - I. R. Stewart - Peter U. Rumjahn - E. J. (Ted) Rumjahn - H. T. Muskett - F. A. Mellors\n\nAlan Robertson's Full Colours Cricket Cap\n\nPhotos provided by Hilary Robertson\n\n1968\n\nPlace your cursor over a face to display a name.\n\nPhoto from the school magazine.\n\nBack Row\n\nEdwin Wass, coach and groundsman - Les Abbie - Malcolm (Mally) Harris\n\nPhil Jones - Graham Schofield - Andy Baker - John Grace, Teacher\n\nFront Row\n\nSteve Tetlow - John Cadden, wicketkeeper - Dave Bruce - Bob Jervis, Captain\n\nJimmy Wardle - Geoff Pollard\n\nFrom the 1967 Green Book\n\nAndy Baker writes:\n\n\"I was captain for 2 years after John Cadden 1970 and 1971. The year above with Bob Jervis as skipper we won the cup. We beat King Edward school in the final at Liverpool CC. We needed 4 to win with 9 wickets down and Phil Jones our last man in with Mally Harris who batted out of his skin that day. King Edward had every man on the boundary and Phil, who was a great fast bowler but couldn't bat for toffee, snicked their fast bowler through the slips for 4 to win it. They had to hurriedly swap the winning ribbons to us as they had assumed King Edward were always going to win it! We were delighted. The groundsman is actually Edwin (Eddie) Wass, Eli Wass' brother. Eli was Liverpool FC grounsman for years at Melwood and was reputed to have cultivated Shanks garden and Bob Paisley's too. Happy days!!\""
