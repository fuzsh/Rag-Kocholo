        "text": "Portsmouth is the home of the Navy and, it is often predicted, the next leader of the Conservative Party.\n\nThat is if Penny Mordaunt, MP for Portsmouth North, can survive the red wave which polls indicate will sweep the political landscape on 4 July.\n\nThe Commons Leader has failed twice to take the Tory crown and Rishi Sunak’s decision to leave D-Day commemorations in Normandy now threatens to sink her re-election hopes.\n\n“I will probably vote for the Conservative Party but I’m not impressed,” says Stephen Greenwood, a retired industrial roofer, out shopping in Cosham high street. “Penny is a good MP for us but what Rishi Sunak did this week will hurt her.\n\n“Penny would be as good a leader as anyone and she would certainly better than what we have got.”\n\nMordaunt’s team will hope that remaining high-profile – taking part in two TV debates opposite foes such as Angela Rayner and Nigel Farage – will help her fight off a challenge from Amanda Martin, the single mother of three standing for Labour.\n\nMartin, a former teacher who first stood in 2019, is a well-known community activist, sitting on the board of the Pompey Supporters Trust, which represents fans of the city’s football club.\n\nCentral to her campaign is Sir Keir Starmer’s pledge to raise defence spending. She also promises simply to be available, no “second job”, regular coffee mornings and pub chats, and an office on the high street (Mordaunt’s can be found on a business park you access by car).\n\nIt feeds on the perception that Mordaunt, who has served as a minister since 2018, has become remote to local people, many of whom are grappling with the rising cost of living.\n\n“I’m under no illusions about the scale of the challenge we are facing,” says Martin, who points out she had barely seen her opponent on the campaign trail. “Penny has been an MP for a long time and she has a large majority.”\n\nMartin has embedded herself in the community and says Starmer’s cautious set of policies inspire trust in a community increasingly sceptical about politics.\n\n“I’ve said that I won’t promise anything that we can’t deliver,” she adds.\n\nMordaunt, a former communications professional, clinched victory in her seat at the second time of asking in 2010, having come within 1,139 votes of ousting Labour in 2005. Since then she has more than doubled her majority to 15,780.\n\nIn normal circumstances that would be a safe seat. But after Brexit, Covid and the disaster of Liz Truss’s premiership, the Tories’ popularity has nosedived – and Sunak’s recent policy blitz, which includes mandatory national service for 18-year-olds, is provoking some of the people it is designed to keep onside.\n\nJanice Welsh, 68, a retired cleaner with relatives in the Navy, says she hss seen the seven-way TV debate featuring Mordaunt. She has voted Conservative all her life but has now lost patience.\n\n“I won’t vote Conservative this time if that idiot [Sunak] is going to bring in national service,” she says. “If young people want to join the Forces, they can do what they want regardless of what the government says. I want the lads to have the choice.\n\n“Is he really trying to put our backs up, because he seems to be pulling out all of the stops?”\n\nNick Gibson, a magistrate and retired consultant, 65, did not see the debate either, but his chief concern was the level of immigration.\n\nHe believes the media has blown the D-Day misstep “out of proportion” but is minded to vote for Reform now that Nigel Farage has returned to frontline politics.\n\n“For me, it’s whether Reform can get enough votes to be a strong opposition,” he says. “The Conservatives have done enough damage to themselves, I don’t think they are credible anymore.”\n\nAsked if he would vote for the Conservative Party if Mordaunt were leader, he adds blankly: “I don’t think it would influence me either way.”\n\n“I don’t want Sunak,” said one woman doing her shopping. “I think he has brought our country down. I was quite happy with BoJo (Boris Johnson).\n\n“I’m going to vote for Reform. I want Farage.”\n\nMordaunt does have a strong personal vote among some in Portsmouth North. At a local park, a dog-walker says she is “the big name around here” and “will hang on”.\n\nBeverly Mos, who owns Strawberry Lemonade Boutique clothing store, says: “I quite like her and will be voting Conservative, much to my son’s dismay. She cares about small businesses like mine and has been here before.\n\n“I would like to see her become leader. She’s quite a big figure around here. She’s very confident and you can see she knows what she’s talking about.”\n\nThe donations taken by Mordaunt’s local Conservative Association – some £60,000 since March – would suggest she has not ruled out a third tilt at the top job.\n\nShe declared what was the last individual donation on the MPs’ Register of Interests in early May, after Tory peer Baron Glendonbrook gave Portsmouth North £50,000. He has previously given the Tories more than £1m but his last donation came in November 2019.\n\nIn March this year, Mordaunt registered a £10,000 gift from Mark Painting. The hedge-fund boss is the founder of Salt Rock Capital, which exists to manage “offshore funds based in the Cayman Islands”.\n\nFor comparison, Mordaunt raised around £94,000 for her unsuccessful leadership bid in 2022.\n\nBut with Mr Sunak’s campaign lurching from one crisis to another, and Reform on the march, she faces an uphill struggle to hang on.\n\n“A lot of people are just ready for change,” says Karen Vine, a retired carer, who says she plans to vote Labour. “You can’t get a GP appointment any more and carers don’t make enough to live on so we are hiring foreign workers to do their job.\n\n“For a lot of people, the real issue is the cost of living. It can’t go on like this.”\n\ni attempted to contact Mordaunt numerous times, including by visiting the local campaign office, but she was unavailable for interview.\n\nElection 2024\n\nThe general election campaign has finished and polling day has seen the Labour Party romp to an impressive win over Rishi Sunak‘s Tories.\n\nSir Keir Starmer and other party leaders have battled to win votes over six weeks, and i‘s election live blog covered every result as it happened. Tory big beasts from Penny Mordaunt to Grant Shapps saw big losses, while Jeremy Corbyn secured the win in Islington North.\n\nNigel Farage’s Reform UK also outdid expectations with four MPs elected.\n\nBut what happens next as Labour win? Follow the i‘s coverage of Starmer’s next moves as the new Prime Minister."
