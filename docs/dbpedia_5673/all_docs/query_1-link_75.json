        "text": "Penny Mordaunt was the Tory MP for Portsmouth North from 2010 to 2024.\n\nShe has served as Leader of the House of Commons since September 2022, and previously served in Theresa May's Cabinet as Secretary of State for International Development from 2017 to 2019, and as Secretary of State for Defence from May to July 2019.\n\nMs Mordaunt has launched two bids to become Tory leader, one after Boris Johnson resigned and another after Liz Truss quit the job. She pulled out of the second contest, meaning Rishi Sunak automatically became Prime Minister."
