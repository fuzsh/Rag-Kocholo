The Museum is chosen for an award for Cricket Scholarship

On 1 September the Sussex Cricket Museum was announced as being the inaugural winner of the Howard Milton Award. The award recognises individuals or groups who have contributed strongly to cricket writing and research. This award, a collaboration between The Cricket Society and the British Society of Sports History, will be awarded annually to a person or persons who have made an outstanding and/or unsung contribution to cricket scholarship. The award seeks to recognise good cricket writing and research whether of an ‘academic’ or ‘popular’ nature. Winners are decided on the recommendations of a panel drawn from officers of both organisations. For the full announcement click here

Discovering former Sussex professionals

Over the course of the next year, this website hopes to commemorate the role of the ‘Player’ in Sussex cricket by initiating a project which will involve researching the lives of these often unsung heroes and putting these ‘Player’ profiles onto the website. Such profiles will focus as much on the family background of these players and what happened to them once they retired, as on their cricketing careers.

There are many of you out there who have a huge depth of knowledge on Sussex County Cricket Club, and who we hope can help us with the research into these players, who because they were professionals and played the game they loved for money have not been given the credit they deserve. We would like, with your help, to do all we can correct what many regard as a historical injustice. If you are able to help us by writing a profile or submitting your research to us we would greatly appreciate the contribution. Click here for more information
