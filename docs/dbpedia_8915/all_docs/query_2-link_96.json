        "text": "Billy Strayhorn\n\nPhoto by Carl Van Vechten (August 14, 1958)\n\nBackground information Birth name William Thomas Strayhorn Born November 29, 1915\n\nDayton, Ohio, U.S. Died May 31, 1967 (aged 51)\n\nNew York City, New York,U.S. Genres Classical, mainstream jazz,swing Occupations Arranger, composer, pianist Instruments Piano Years active 1934–1964 Labels United Artists, Felsted, Mercer Associated acts Duke Ellington Website www.billystrayhorn.com\n\nWilliam Thomas “Billy” Strayhorn (November 29, 1915 – May 31, 1967) was anAmerican jazz composer, pianist and arranger, best known for his successful collaboration with bandleader and composer Duke Ellington lasting nearly three decades. His compositions include “Take the ‘A’ Train,” “Chelsea Bridge,” and “Lush Life.”\n\nEarly life\n\nStrayhorn was born in Dayton, Ohio. His family soon moved to the Homewood section ofPittsburgh, Pennsylvania. However, his mother’s family was from Hillsborough, North Carolina, and she sent him there to protect him from his father’s drunken sprees. Strayhorn spent many months of his childhood at his grandparents’ house in Hillsborough. In an interview, Strayhorn said that his grandmother was his primary influence during the first ten years of his life. He first became interested in music while living with her, playing hymns on her piano, and playing records on her Victrola record player.\n\nReturn to Pittsburgh and meeting Ellington\n\nStrayhorn returned to Pittsburgh, and attended Westinghouse High School, later attended by Erroll Garner and Ahmad Jamal. In Pittsburgh, he began his musical career, studyingclassical music for a time at the Pittsburgh Music Institute, writing a high school musical, forming a musical trio that played daily on a local radio station, and, while still in his teens, composing (with lyrics) the songs “Life Is Lonely” (later renamed “Lush Life“), “My Little Brown Book”, and “Something to Live For“. While still in grade school, he worked odd jobs to earn enough money to buy his first piano. While in high school, he played in the school band, and studied under the same teacher who had also instructed jazz pianists Erroll Garner and Mary Lou Williams. By age 19, he was writing for a professional musical,Fantastic Rhythm.\n\nThough classical music was Strayhorn’s first love, his ambition to become a classical composer was shot down by the harsh reality of a black man trying to make it in the then almost completely white classical world. Strayhorn was then introduced to the music of pianists like Art Tatum and Teddy Wilson at age 19. These musicians guided him into the realm of jazz where he remained for the rest of his life. His first jazz exposure was in a combo called the Mad Hatters who played around Pittsburgh.\n\nHe met Duke Ellington in December 1938, after an Ellington performance in Pittsburgh (he had first seen Ellington play in Pittsburgh in 1933). Here he first told, and then showed, the band leader how he would have arranged one of Duke’s own pieces. Ellington was impressed enough to invite other band members to hear Strayhorn. At the end of the visit, he arranged for Strayhorn to meet him when the band returned to New York. Strayhorn worked for Ellington for the next quarter century as an arranger, composer, occasional pianist and collaborator until his early death from cancer. As Ellington described him, “Billy Strayhorn was my right arm, my left arm, all the eyes in the back of my head, my brain waves in his head, and his in mine.”\n\nBilly Strayhorn, New York, N.Y., between 1946 and 1948\n\nWorking with Ellington\n\nStrayhorn’s relationship with Ellington was always difficult to pin down: Strayhorn was a gifted composer and arranger who seemed to flourish in Duke’s shadow. Ellington was somewhat of a father figure and the band, by and large, was affectionately protective of the diminutive, mild-mannered, unselfish Strayhorn, nicknamed by the band “Strays”, “Weely”, and “Swee’ Pea”. Ellington may have taken advantage of him, but not in the mercenary way that others had taken advantage of Ellington; instead, he used Strayhorn to complete his thoughts, while giving Strayhorn the freedom to write on his own and enjoy at least some of the credit he deserved. Though Duke Ellington took credit for much of Strayhorn’s work, he did not maliciously drown out his partner. Ellington would make jokes onstage like, “Strayhorn does a lot of the work but I get to take the bows!”\n\nStrayhorn composed the band’s best known theme, “Take the “A” Train“, and a number of other pieces that became part of the band’s repertoire. In some cases Strayhorn received attribution for his work such as “Lotus Blossom”, “Chelsea Bridge“, and “Rain Check”, while others, such as “Day Dream” and “Something to Live For“, were listed as collaborations with Ellington or, in the case of “Satin Doll” and “Sugar Hill Penthouse”, were credited to Ellington alone. Strayhorn also arranged many of Ellington’s band-within-band recordings and provided harmonic clarity, taste, and polish to Duke’s compositions. On the other hand, Ellington gave Strayhorn full credit as his collaborator on later, larger works such as Such Sweet Thunder, A Drum Is a Woman, The Perfume Suite and The Far East Suite, where Strayhorn and Ellington worked closely together. Strayhorn also often sat in on the piano with the Ellington Orchestra, both live and in the studio.\n\nDetroit Free Press music critic Mark Stryker concludes that the work of Strayhorn and Ellington in Anatomy of a Murder is “indispensable, [although] … too sketchy to rank in the top echelon among Ellington-Strayhorn masterpiece suites like Such Sweet Thunder and The Far East Suite, but its most inspired moments are their equal.” Film historians have recognized the soundtrack “as a landmark — the first significant Hollywood film music by African Americans comprising non-diegetic music, that is, music whose source is not visible or implied by action in the film, like an on-screen band.” The score avoided the cultural stereotypes which previously characterized jazz scores and rejected a strict adherence to visuals in ways that presaged the New Wave cinema of the ’60s.”\n\nPersonal life\n\nShortly before Ellington went on his second European tour with his orchestra, from March to May 1939, Ellington announced to his sister Ruth and son Mercer Ellington that Strayhorn “is staying with us.” Through Mercer, Strayhorn met his first partner, African-American musician Aaron Bridgers, with whom Strayhorn lived until Bridgers moved to Paris in 1947.\n\nStrayhorn was openly gay. He participated in many civil rights causes. As a committed friend to Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr., he arranged and conducted “King Fit the Battle of Alabam'” for the Ellington Orchestra in 1963 for the historical revue (and album) My People, dedicated to Dr. King.\n\nStrayhorn’s strong character left an impression on many people who met him. He had a major influence on the career of Lena Horne, who wanted to marry Strayhorn and considered him to have been the love of her life. Strayhorn used his classical background in guiding Horne’s singing technique toward improvement. They eventually recorded songs together. In the 1950s, Strayhorn left his musical partner Duke Ellington for a few years to pursue a solo career of his own. He came out with a few solo albums and revues for the Copasetics (a New York show-business society), and took on theater productions with his friend Luther Henderson. Strayhorn’s compositions are known for the bittersweet sentiment and classically infused designs that set him apart from Ellington.\n\nIllness and death\n\nStrayhorn was diagnosed with esophageal cancer in 1964, which eventually caused his death in 1967. Strayhorn finally succumbed in the early morning on May 31, 1967, in the company of his partner, Bill Grove. It has often been falsely reported that Strayhorn died in Lena Horne’s arms. By her own account, Horne was touring in Europe when she received the news of Strayhorn’s death. His ashes were scattered in the Hudson River by a gathering of his closest friends.\n\nWhile in the hospital, he had submitted his final composition to Ellington. “Blood Count” was used as the first track to Ellington’s memorial album for Strayhorn, …And His Mother Called Him Bill, which was recorded several months after Strayhorn’s death. The last track of the album is a spontaneous solo version of “Lotus Blossom” performed by Ellington, who sat at the piano and played for his friend while the band (who can be heard in the background) packed up after the formal end of the recording session.\n\nLegacy\n\nStrayhorn’s arrangements had a tremendous impact on the Ellington band. Ellington always wrote for the personnel he had at the time, showcasing both the personalities and sound of soloists such as Johnny Hodges, Harry Carney, Ben Webster, Lawrence Brown andJimmy Blanton, and drawing on the contrasts between players or sections to create a new sound for his band. Strayhorn brought a more linear, classically schooled ear to Ellington’s works, setting down in permanent form the sound and structures that Ellington sought.\n\nStrayhorn’s own work, particularly his pieces written for Johnny Hodges on alto saxophone, often had a bittersweet, languorous flavor.\n\nA Pennsylvania State historical Marker was placed at Westinghouse High School, 1101 N. Murtland St., Homewood, Pittsburgh, PA highlighting his accomplishments and marking the high school he graduated from.\n\nThe former Regent Theatre in Pittsburgh’s East Liberty neighborhood was renamed the Kelly-Strayhorn Theatre in honor of Billy Strayhorn and fellow Pittsburgher Gene Kelly in 2000. It is a community based performing arts theatre.\n\nBenny Goodman\n\nGoodman in Stage Door Canteen, 1943. Background information Birth name Benjamin David Goodman Also known as “King of Swing”, “The Professor”, “Patriarch of the Clarinet”, “Swing’s Senior Statesman” Born May 30, 1909\n\nChicago, Illinois\n\nUnited States Died June 13, 1986 (aged 77)\n\nNew York City, New York\n\nUnited States Genres Swing, big band Occupations Musician, bandleader, songwriter Instruments Clarinet Years active 1926–1986 Website www.bennygoodman.com\n\nBenjamin David “Benny” Goodman (May 30, 1909 – June 13, 1986) was an American jazz and swing musician, clarinetist and bandleader; known as the “King of Swing”.\n\nIn the mid-1930s, Benny Goodman led one of the most popular musical groups in America. His January 16, 1938 concert at Carnegie Hall in New York City is described by critic Bruce Eder as “the single most important jazz or popular music concert in history: jazz’s ‘coming out’ party to the world of ‘respectable’ music.”\n\nGoodman’s bands launched the careers of many major names in jazz, and during an era of segregation, he also led one of the first well-known racially integrated jazz groups. Goodman continued to perform to nearly the end of his life, while exploring an interest in classical music.\n\nChildhood and early years\n\nGoodman was born in Chicago, the ninth of twelve children of poor Jewish immigrants from the Russian Empire, who lived in the Maxwell Street neighborhood. His father was David Goodman (1873-1926), a tailor from Warsaw; his mother was Dora Grisinsky (1873-1964) from Kaunas, Lithuania. His parents met in Baltimore, Maryland, and moved to Chicago before Benny was born.\n\nWhen Benny was 10, his father enrolled him and two of his older brothers in music lessons at the Kehelah Jacob Synagogue. The next year he joined the boys club band at Jane Addams‘ Hull House, where he received lessons from director James Sylvester. He also received two years of instruction from the classically trained clarinetist Franz Schoepp. His early influences were New Orleans jazz clarinetists working in Chicago, notably Johnny Dodds, Leon Roppolo, and Jimmy Noone. Goodman learned quickly, becoming a strong player at an early age: he was soon playing professionally in various bands.\n\nGoodman made his professional debut in 1921 at Central Park Theater in Chicago and entered Harrison High School in 1922. He joined the musicians’s union in 1923 and that summer he met Bix Beiderbecke. He attended Lewis Institute (now Illinois Institute of Technology) in 1924 as a high school sophomore, while also playing the clarinet in a dance hall band. (He was awarded an honorary LL.D. from IIT in 1968.) At age 14, he was in a band that featured the legendary Bix Beiderbecke. When Goodman was 16, he joined one of Chicago’s top bands, the Ben Pollack Orchestra, with which he made his first recordings in 1926.\n\nHe made his first record on Vocalion under his own name two years later. Goodman recorded with the regular Pollack band and smaller groups drawn from the orchestra through 1929. The side sessions produced scores of sides recorded for the variousdimestore record labels under an array of group names, including Mills’ Musical Clowns, Goody’s Good Timers, The Hotsy Totsy Gang, Jimmy Backen’s Toe Ticklers, Dixie Daisies, and Kentucky Grasshoppers.\n\nGoodman’s father, David, was a working-class immigrant about whom Benny said (interview, Downbeat, February 8, 1956); “…Pop worked in the stockyards, shoveling lard in its unrefined state. He had those boots, and he’d come home at the end of the day exhausted, stinking to high heaven, and when he walked in it made me sick. I couldn’t stand it. I couldn’t stand the idea of Pop every day standing in that stuff, shoveling it around”.\n\nOn December 9, 1926, David Goodman was killed in a traffic accident. Benny had recently joined the Pollack band and was urging his father to retire, since he and his brother (Harry) were now doing well as professional musicians. According to James Lincoln Collier, “Pop looked Benny in the eye and said, ‘Benny, you take care of yourself, I’ll take care of myself.'” Collier continues: “It was an unhappy choice. Not long afterwards, as he was stepping down from a streetcar—according to one story—he was struck by a car. He never regained consciousness and died in the hospital the next day. It was a bitter blow to the family, and it haunted Benny to the end that his father had not lived to see the success he, and some of the others, made of themselves.” “Benny described his father’s death as ‘the saddest thing that ever happened in our family.'”\n\nCareer\n\nGoodman left for New York City and became a successful session musician during the late 1920s and early 1930s (mostly with Ben Pollack‘s band between 1926 and 1929). A notable March 21, 1928 Victor session found Goodman alongside Glenn Miller, Tommy Dorsey, and Joe Venuti in the All-Star Orchestra, directed by Nat Shilkret. He played with the nationally known bands of Ben Selvin, Red Nichols, Isham Jones (although he is not on any of Jones’s records), and Ted Lewis. He recorded sides for Brunswick under the name Benny Goodman’s Boys, a band that featured Glenn Miller. In 1928, Benny Goodman and Glenn Miller wrote the instrumental “Room 1411“, which was released as a Brunswick 78. He also recorded musical soundtracks for movie shorts; fans believe that Benny Goodman’s clarinet can be heard on the soundtrack of One A. M., a Charlie Chaplin comedy re-released to theaters in 1934.\n\nDuring this period as a successful session musician, John Hammond arranged for a series of jazz sides recorded for and issued on Columbia starting in 1933 and continuing until his signing with Victor in 1935, during his success on radio. There were also a number of commercial studio sides recorded for Melotone Records between late 1930 and mid-1931 under Goodman’s name. The all-star Columbia sides featured Jack Teagarden, Joe Sullivan, Dick McDonough, Arthur Schutt, Gene Krupa, Teddy Wilson, Coleman Hawkins (for 1 session), and vocalists Jack Teagarden and Mildred Bailey, and the first two recorded vocals by a young Billie Holiday.\n\nIn 1934 Goodman auditioned for NBC‘s Let’s Dance, a well-regarded three-hour weekly radio program that featured various styles of dance music. His familiar theme song by that title was based on Invitation to the Dance by Carl Maria von Weber. Since he needed new arrangements every week for the show, his agent, John Hammond, suggested that he purchase “hot” (swing) arrangements from Fletcher Henderson, an African-American musician from Atlanta who had New York’s most popular African-American band in the 1920s and early 1930s.\n\nGoodman, a wise businessman, helped Henderson in 1929 when the stock market crashed. He purchased all of Henderson’s song books, and hired Henderson’s band members to teach his musicians how to play the music. In 1932, his career officially began with Fletcher Henderson. Although Henderson’s orchestra was at its climax of creativity, it had not reached any peaks of popularity. During the Depression, Fletcher disbanded his orchestra as he was in financial debt.\n\nIn early 1935, Goodman and his band were one of three bands (the others were Xavier Cugat and “Kel Murray” [r.n. Murray Kellner]) featured on Let’s Dance where they played arrangements by Henderson along with hits such as “Get Happy” and “Jingle Bells” from composer and arranger Spud Murphy. Goodman’s portion of the program from New York, at 12:30 a.m. Eastern Time, aired too late to attract a large East Coast audience. However, unknown to him, the time slot gave him an avid following on the West Coast (they heard him at 9:30 p.m. Pacific Time). He and his band remained on Let’s Dance until May of that year when a strike by employees of the series’ sponsor, Nabisco, forced the cancellation of the radio show. An engagement was booked at Manhattan’s Roosevelt Grill (filling in for Guy Lombardo), but the crowd there expected ‘sweet’ music and Goodman’s band was unsuccessful. The band set out on a tour of America in May 1935, but was still poorly received. By August 1935, Goodman found himself with a band that was nearly broke, disillusioned and ready to quit.\n\nCatalyst for the Swing era\n\nAn eager crowd of Goodman fans inOakland\n\nIn July 1935, a record of the Goodman band playing the Henderson arrangements of “King Porter Stomp” backed with “Sometimes I’m Happy“, Victor 78 25090, had been released to ecstatic reviews in both Down Beat and Melody Maker. Reports were that in Pittsburgh at the Stanley Theater some of the kids danced in the aisles, but in general these arrangements had made little impact on the band’s tour until August 19 when they arrived in Oakland to play at McFadden’s Ballroom. There, Goodman and his artists Gene Krupa,Bunny Berigan, and Helen Ward found a large crowd of young dancers, raving and cheering the hot music they had heard on the Let’s Dance radio show. Herb Caen wrote that “from the first note, the place was in an uproar.” One night later, at Pismo Beach, the show was another flop, and the band thought the overwhelming reception in Oakland had been a fluke.\n\nThe next night, August 21, 1935 at the Palomar Ballroom in Los Angeles, Goodman and his band began a three-week engagement. On top of the Let’s Dance airplay, Al Jarvis had been playing Goodman records on KFWB radio, and Los Angeles fans were primed to hear him in person. Goodman started the evening with stock arrangements, but after an indifferent response, began the second set with the arrangements by Fletcher Henderson and Spud Murphy. According to Willard Alexander, the band’s booking agent, Krupa said “If we’re gonna die, Benny, let’s die playing our own thing.” The crowd broke into cheers and applause. News reports spread word of the enthusiastic dancing and exciting new music that was happening. Over the course of the engagement, the “Jitterbug” began to appear as a new dance craze, and radio broadcasts carried the band’s performances across the nation.\n\nThe Palomar engagement was such a marked success it is often exaggeratedly described as the beginning of the swing era. Donald Clarke wrote “It is clear in retrospect that the Swing Era had been waiting to happen, but it was Goodman and his band that touched it off.”\n\nIn November 1935 Goodman accepted an invitation to play in Chicago at the Joseph Urban Room at the Congress Hotel. His stay there extended to six months and his popularity was cemented by nationwide radio broadcasts over NBC affiliate stations. While in Chicago, the band recorded If I Could Be With You, Stompin’ At The Savoy, and Goody, Goody. Goodman also played three special concerts produced by jazz aficionado and Chicago socialite Helen Oakley. These “Rhythm Club” concerts at the Congress Hotel included sets in which Goodman and Krupa sat in with Fletcher Henderson’s band, perhaps the first racially integrated big band appearance before a paying audience in the United States. Goodman and Krupa played in a trio with Teddy Wilson on piano. Both combinations were well-received, and Wilson stayed on.\n\nIn his 1935–1936 radio broadcasts from Chicago, Goodman was introduced as the “Rajah of Rhythm.” Slingerland Drum Company had been calling Krupa the “King of Swing” as part of a sales campaign, but shortly after Goodman and crew left Chicago in May 1936 to spend the summer filming The Big Broadcast of 1937 in Hollywood, the title “King of Swing” was applied to Goodman by the media. Goodman left record company RCA for Columbia, following his agent and soon to be brother-in-law John Hammond.\n\nAt the end of June 1936, Goodman went to Hollywood, where, on June 30, 1936 his band began CBS’s “Camel Caravan,” its third, and, according to Connor and Hicks, its greatest of them all, sponsored radio show, co-starring Goodman and his old boss Nat Shilkret. By spring, 1936, bandleader Fletcher Henderson was writing arrangements for Goodman’s band. He would disband his own group in 1939 and become a full-time arranger for Goodman. Other noteworthy arrangers in the Goodman band were Jimmy Mundy, 1935 to 1939 (overlapping with Henderson) and Eddie Sauter, the 1940s. In 1940, Benny developed a serious case of sciatica, and had others compose pieces for him, such as Eddie Sauter who did not fully compose flawless compositions such as Benny Rides Again where the clarinet piece sounded like two tempo pieces instead of one. During 1945, the orchestra disbanded. After, Benny still continued to tour internationally, and played in classical concert halls with major composers such as Hindemith and Copland.\n\nCarnegie Hall concert\n\n“ In bringing jazz to Carnegie, [Benny Goodman was], in effect, smuggling American contraband into the halls of European high culture, and Goodman and his 15 men pull[ed] it off with the audacity and precision of Ocean’s Eleven. ” —Will Friedwald\n\nIn late 1937, Goodman’s publicist Wynn Nathanson attempted a publicity stunt by suggesting Goodman and his band should play Carnegie Hall in New York City. If this concert were to take place, then Benny Goodman would be the first jazz bandleader to perform at Carnegie Hall. “Benny Goodman was initially hesitant about the concert, fearing for the worst; however, when his film Hollywood Hotel opened to rave reviews and giant lines, he threw himself into the work. He gave up several dates and insisted on holding rehearsals inside Carnegie Hall to familiarize the band with the lively acoustics.”\n\nThe concert was the evening of January 16, 1938. It sold out weeks before, with the capacity 2,760 seats going for the top price of US$2.75 a seat, for the time a very high price. The concert began with three contemporary numbers from the Goodman band—”Don’t Be That Way,” “Sometimes I’m Happy,” and “One O’Clock Jump.” They then played a history of jazz, starting with a Dixieland quartet performing “Sensation Rag”, originally recorded by the Original Dixieland Jazz Band in 1918. Once again, initial crowd reaction, though polite, was tepid. Then came a jam session on “Honeysuckle Rose” featuring members of the Count Basie and Duke Ellington bands as guests. (The surprise of the session: Goodman handing a solo to Basie’s guitarist Freddie Green who was never a featured soloist but earned his reputation as the best rhythm guitarist in the genre—he responded with a striking round of chord improvisations.) As the concert went on, things livened up. The Goodman band and quartet took over the stage and performed the numbers that had already made them famous. Some later trio and quartet numbers were well-received, and a vocal on “Loch Lomond” by Martha Tilton provoked five curtain calls and cries for an encore. The encore forced Goodman to make his only audience announcement for the night, stating that they had no encore prepared but that Martha would return shortly with another number.\n\nBy the time the band got to the climactic piece “Sing, Sing, Sing“, success was assured. This performance featured playing by tenor saxophonist Babe Russin, trumpeter Harry James, and Benny Goodman, backed by drummer Gene Krupa. When Goodman finished his solo, he unexpectedly gave a solo to pianist Jess Stacy. “At the Carnegie Hall concert, after the usual theatrics, Jess Stacy was allowed to solo and, given the venue, what followed was appropriate,” wrote David Rickert. “Used to just playing rhythm on the tune, he was unprepared for a turn in the spotlight, but what came out of his fingers was a graceful, impressionistic marvel with classical flourishes, yet still managed to swing. It was the best thing he ever did, and it’s ironic that such a layered, nuanced performance came at the end of such a chaotic, bombastic tune.”\n\nThis concert has been regarded as one of the most significant in jazz history. After years of work by musicians from all over the country, jazz had finally been accepted by mainstream audiences. Recordings were made of this concert, but even by the technology of the day the equipment used was not of the finest quality. Acetate recordings of the concert were made, and aluminum studio masters were also cut.\n\n“ The recording was produced by Albert Marx as a special gift for his wife, Helen Ward and a second set for Benny. He contracted Artists Recording Studio to make 2 sets. Artists Recording only had 2 turntables so they farmed out the second set to Raymond Scott‘s recording studio.[…] It was Benny’s sister-in-law who found the recordings in Benny’s apartment [in 1950] and brought them to Benny’s attention. ” —Ross Firestone\n\nGoodman took the newly discovered recording to his record company, Columbia, and a selection was issued on LP. These recordings have not been out of print since they were first issued. In early 1998, the aluminum masters were rediscovered and a new CD set of the concert was released based on these masters. The album released based on those masters went on to be one of the best selling live jazz albums of all time.\n\nCharlie Christian\n\nPianist/arranger Mary Lou Williams was a good friend of both Columbia records producer John Hammond and Benny Goodman. She first suggested to John Hammond that he see Charlie Christian.\n\nCharlie Christian was playing at the Ritz in Oklahoma City where […] John Hammond heard him in 1939. Hammond recommended him to Benny Goodman, but the band leader wasn’t interested. The idea of an electrified guitar didn’t appeal, and Goodman didn’t care for Christian’s flashy style of dressing. Reportedly, Hammond personally installed Christian onstage during a break in a Goodman concert in Beverly Hills. Irritated to see Christian among the band, Goodman struck up “Rose Room“, not expecting the guitarist to know the tune. What followed amazed everyone who heard the 45-minute performance.\n\nCharlie was a hit on the electric guitar and remained in the Benny Goodman Sextet for two years (1939–1941). He wrote many of the group’s head arrangements (some of which Goodman took credit for) and was an inspiration to all. The sextet made him famous and provided him with a steady income while Charlie worked on legitimizing, popularizing, revolutionizing, and standardizing the electric guitar as a jazz instrument.\n\nCharlie Christian’s recordings and rehearsal dubs made with Benny Goodman in the early forties are widely known and were released by Columbia.\n\nBeyond swing\n\nGoodman continued his meteoric rise throughout the late 1930s with his big band, his trio and quartet, and a sextet. By the mid-1940s, however, big bands lost a lot of their popularity. In 1941, ASCAP had a licensing war with music publishers. In 1942 to 1944 and 1948, the musician’s union went on strike against the major record labels in the United States, and singers took the spot in popularity that the big bands had once enjoyed. During this strike, the United States War Department approached the union and requested the production of the V-Disc, a set of records containing new and fresh music for soldiers to listen to. Also, by the late 1940s, swing was no longer the dominant mode of jazz musicians.\n\nBebop, Cool Jazz\n\nBy the 1940s, jazz musicians were borrowing advanced ideas from classical music. The recordings Goodman made in bop style for Capitol Records were highly praised by jazz critics. When Goodman was starting a bebop band, he hired Buddy Greco, Zoot Sims, Wardell Gray and a few other modern players.\n\nBenny Goodman (third from left) in 1952 with some of his former musicians, seated around piano left to right: Vernon Brown,George Auld, Gene Krupa, Clint Neagley,Ziggy Elman, Israel Crosby and Teddy Wilson (at piano)\n\n“ Pianist/arranger Mary Lou Williams had been a favorite of Benny’s since she first appeared on the national scene in 1936 […]. [A]s Goodman warily approached the music of [Charlie] Parker and [Dizzy] Gillespie, he turned to Williams for musical guidance. […] Pianist Mel Powell was the first to introduce the new music to Benny in 1945, and kept him abreast to what was happening around 52nd Street. ” —Schoenberg\n\nGoodman enjoyed the bebop and cool jazz that was beginning to arrive in the 1940s. When Goodman heard Thelonious Monk, a celebrated pianist and accompanist to bop players Charlie Parker, Dizzy Gillespie and Kenny Clarke, he remarked, “I like it, I like that very much. I like the piece and I like the way he played it. […] I think he’s got a sense of humor and he’s got some good things there.”\n\n“ Benny had heard this Swedish clarinet player named Stan Hasselgard playing bebop, and he loved it … So he started a bebop band. But after a year and a half, he became frustrated. He eventually reformed his band and went back to playing Fletcher Henderson arrangements. Benny was a swing player and decided to concentrate on what he does best. ” —Nate Guidry\n\nBy 1953, Goodman completely changed his mind about bebop. “Maybe bop has done more to set music back for years than anything […] Basically it’s all wrong. It’s not even knowing the scales. […] Bop was mostly publicity and people figuring angles.”\n\nForays into classical repertoire\n\nGoodman’s first classical recording dates from April 25, 1938 when he recorded Mozart‘s Clarinet Quintet in A major, K. 581, with the Budapest Quartet. After his bop period, Goodman furthered his interest in classical music written for the clarinet, and frequently met with top classical clarinetists of the day. In 1946, he met Ingolf Dahl, an emigre classical composer on the faculty of the University of Southern California, who was then musical director of the Victor Borge show. They played chamber music together (Brahms,Milhaud, Hindemith, Debussy) and in 1948 Goodman played in the world premiere performance of Dahl’s Concerto a Tre.\n\nIn 1949, when he was 40, Goodman decided to study with Reginald Kell, one of the world’s leading classical clarinetists. To do so, he had to change his entire technique: instead of holding the mouthpiece between his front teeth and lower lip, as he had done since he first took a clarinet in hand 30 years earlier, Goodman learned to adjust his embouchure to the use of both lips and even to use new fingering techniques. He had his old finger calluses removed and started to learn how to play his clarinet again—almost from scratch.\n\nClarinetists all over the world are indebted to Goodman for his being singly responsible for having commissioned many major works of twentieth century chamber music for clarinet and small ensembles as well as compositions for clarinet and symphony orchestra that are now standard repertoire in the field of classical performance. He also gave premiere performances of other works written by leading composers in addition to the pieces he commissioned, namely Contrasts by Béla Bartók, Clarinet Concerto No. 2, Op. 115 byMalcolm Arnold, Derivations for Clarinet and Band by Morton Gould, and Aaron Copland‘s Clarinet Concerto. While Leonard Bernstein‘s Prelude, Fugue, and Riffs was commissioned for Woody Herman‘s big band, it was premiered by Goodman. Woody Herman was the dedicatee (1945) and first performer (1946) of Igor Stravinsky‘s Ebony Concerto, but many years later Stravinsky made another recording, this time with Benny Goodman as the soloist.[40]\n\nHe made a further recording of Mozart’s Clarinet Quintet, in July 1956 with the Boston Symphony String Quartet, at the Berkshire Festival; on the same occasion he also recorded Mozart’s Clarinet Concerto in A major, K. 622, with the Boston Symphony Orchestra under Charles Munch. He also recorded the clarinet concertos of Weber and Carl Nielsen.\n\nOther recordings of classical repertoire by Goodman are:\n\nPremiere Rhapsodie for Clarinet by Claude Debussy\n\nClarinet Sonata No. 2 in E flat by Johannes Brahms\n\nRondo from Grand Duo Concertant in E flat by Weber, and\n\nAn arrangement by Simeon Bellison of Beethoven‘s Variations on a theme from Mozart’s “Don Giovanni“.\n\nTouring with Armstrong\n\nAfter forays outside of swing, Goodman started a new band in 1953. According to Donald Clarke, this was not a happy time for Goodman.\n\nGoodman with his band and singer,Peggy Lee, in the film Stage Door Canteen(1943)\n\n“ In 1953 Goodman re-formed his classic band for an expensive tour with Louis Armstrong’s All Stars that turned into a famous disaster. He managed to insult Armstrong at the beginning; then he was appalled at the vaudeville aspects of Louis’s act […] a contradiction of everything Goodman stood for. ” —Donald Clarke\n\nMovies\n\nBenny Goodman’s band appeared as a specialty act in major musical features, including The Big Broadcast of 1937, Hollywood Hotel(1938), Syncopation (1942), The Powers Girl (1942), Stage Door Canteen (1943), The Gang’s All Here (1943), Sweet and Lowdown (1944) and A Song Is Born (1948). Goodman’s only starring feature was Sweet and Low-Down (1944).\n\nGoodman’s success story was told in the 1955 motion picture The Benny Goodman Story with Steve Allen and Donna Reed. A Universal-International production, it was a follow up to 1954’s successful The Glenn Miller Story. The screenplay was heavily fictionalized, but the music was the real draw. Many of Goodman’s professional colleagues appear in the film, including Ben Pollack,Gene Krupa, Lionel Hampton and Harry James.\n\nPersonality and influence\n\nGoodman was regarded by some as a demanding taskmaster, by others an arrogant and eccentric martinet. Many musicians spoke of “The Ray”, Goodman’s trademark glare that he bestowed on a musician who failed to perform to his demanding standards. Guitarist Allan Reuss incurred the maestro’s displeasure on one occasion, and Goodman relegated him to the rear of the bandstand, where his contribution would be totally drowned out by the other musicians. Vocalists Anita O’Day and Helen Forrest spoke bitterly of their experiences singing with Goodman. “The twenty or so months I spent with Benny felt like twenty years,” said Forrest. “When I look back, they seem like a life sentence.” At the same time, there are reports that he privately funded several college educations and was sometimes very generous, though always secretly. When a friend once asked him why, he reportedly said, “Well, if they knew about it, everyone would come to me with their hand out.”\n\n“As far as I’m concerned, what he did in those days—and they were hard days, in 1937—made it possible for Negroes to have their chance in baseball and other fields.” —Lionel Hampton on Benny Goodman\n\nGoodman is also responsible for a significant step in racial integration in America. In the early 1930s, black and white jazz musicians could not play together in most clubs or concerts. In the Southern states, racial segregation was enforced by the Jim Crow laws. Benny Goodman broke with tradition by hiring Teddy Wilson to play with him and drummer Gene Krupa in the Benny Goodman Trio. In 1936, he added Lionel Hampton on vibes to form the Benny Goodman Quartet; in 1939 he added pioneering jazz guitarist Charlie Christian to his band and small ensembles, who played with him until his death from tuberculosis less than three years later. This integration in music happened ten years before Jackie Robinson became the first black American to enter Major League Baseball. “[Goodman’s] popularity was such that he could remain financially viable without touring the South, where he would have been subject to arrest for violating Jim Crow laws.” According to Jazz by Ken Burns, when someone asked him why he “played with that nigger” (referring to Teddy Wilson), Goodman replied, “I’ll knock you out if you use that word around me again”.\n\nJohn Hammond and Alice Goodman\n\nOne of Benny Goodman’s closest friends off and on, from the 1930s onward was celebrated Columbia records producer John H. Hammond, who influenced Goodman’s move from RCA to the newly created Columbia records in 1939.\n\nBenny Goodman married Hammond’s sister Alice Frances Hammond (1913–1978) on March 14, 1942. They had two daughters, Benjie and Rachel. Alice was previously married to British politician Arthur Duckworth, from whom she obtained a divorce.\n\nBoth daughters studied music, though neither was as successful as her father.\n\nHammond had encouraged Goodman to integrate his band, persuading him to employ pianist Teddy Wilson. But Hammond’s tendency to interfere in the musical affairs of Goodman’s and other bands led to Goodman pulling away from him. In 1953 they had another falling-out during Goodman’s ill-fated tour with Louis Armstrong, which was produced by John Hammond.\n\nGoodman appeared on a 1975 PBS salute to Hammond but remained at a distance. In the 1980s, following the death of Alice Goodman, John Hammond and Benny Goodman, both by then elderly, reconciled. On June 25, 1985, Goodman appeared at Avery Fisher Hall in New York City for “A Tribute to John Hammond”.\n\nLater years\n\nBenny Goodman in concert in Nuremberg, Germany (1971)\n\nAfter winning numerous polls over the years as best jazz clarinetist, Goodman was inducted into the Down Beat Jazz Hall of Fame in 1957.\n\nGoodman continued to play on records and in small groups. One exception to this pattern was a collaboration with George Benson in the 1970s. The two met when they taped a PBS salute to John Hammond and re-created some of the famous Goodman-Charlie Christian duets.\n\nBenson later appeared on several tracks of a Goodman album released as “Seven Come Eleven.” In general Goodman continued to play in the swing style he was most known for. He did, however, practice and perform classical clarinet pieces and commissioned compositions for clarinet. Periodically he would organize a new band and play a jazz festival or go on an international tour.\n\nDespite increasing health problems, he continued to play until his death from a heart attack in New York City in 1986 at the age of 77, in his home at Manhattan House, 200 East 66th Street. A longtime resident of Stamford, Connecticut, Benny Goodman is interred in the Long Ridge Cemetery in Stamford. The same year, Goodman was honored with the Grammy Lifetime Achievement Award. Benny Goodman’s musical papers were donated to Yale University after his death.\n\nGoodman received honorary doctorates from Union College, University of Illinois, Southern Illinois University Edwardsville, Bard College, Columbia University, Yale University, and Harvard University.\n\nHe is a member of the National Association of Broadcasters Hall of Fame in the radio division.\n\nHis music was featured in the 2010 documentary Jews and Baseball: An American Love Story, narrated by Academy Award winner Dustin Hoffman.\n\nRoy Eldridge\n\nEldridge at the Village Jazz Lounge in Walt Disney World (photo by Laura Kolb) Background information Birth name David Roy Eldridge Born January 30, 1911 Origin Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania,U.S. Died February 26, 1989 (aged 78) Genres Jazz\n\nSwing\n\nBig Band Occupations Trumpeter Instruments Trumpet Associated acts Charlie Barnet\n\nDavid Roy Eldridge (January 30, 1911 – February 26, 1989), commonly known as Roy Eldridge, and nicknamed “Little Jazz”, was an American jazz trumpet player. His sophisticated use of harmony, including the use of tritone substitutions, his virtuosic solos exhibiting a departure from the smooth and lyrical style of earlier jazz trumpet innovator Louis Armstrong, and his strong impact onDizzy Gillespie mark him as one of the most influential musicians of the swing era and a precursor of bebop.\n\nEarly life\n\nEldridge was born on the North Side of Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania on January 30, 1911 to parents Alexander, a carpenter, and Blanche, a gifted pianist with a talent for reproducing music by ear, a trait that Eldridge claimed to have inherited from her. Eldridge began playing the piano at age five; he claims to have been able to play coherent blues licks at even this young age. The young Eldridge looked up to his older brother, Joe, particularly because of Joe’s diverse musical talents on the violin, alto saxophone, and clarinet. Roy took up the drums at the age of six, taking lessons and playing locally. Joe recognized his brother’s natural talent on the bugle, which Roy played in a local church band, and tried to convince Roy to play the valved trumpet. When Roy began to play drums in his brother’s band, Joe soon convinced him to pick up the trumpet, but Roy made little effort to gain proficiency on the instrument at first. It was not until the death of their mother, when Roy was eleven, and his father’s subsequent remarriage that Roy began practicing more rigorously, locking himself in his room for hours, and particularly honing the instrument’s upper register. From an early age, Roy lacked proficiency at sight-reading, a gap in his musical education that would affect him for much of his early career, but he could replicate melodies by ear very effectively.\n\nCareer\n\nEarly career and traveling bands\n\nEldridge led and played in a number of bands during his early years, moving extensively throughout the American Midwest. He absorbed the influence of saxophonists Benny Carter and Coleman Hawkins, setting himself the task of learning Hawkins’s 1926 solo on “The Stampede” (by Fletcher Henderson‘s Orchestra) in developing an equivalent trumpet style.\n\nEldridge left home after being expelled from high school in ninth grade, joining a traveling show at the age of sixteen; the show soon folded, however, and he was left in Youngstown, Ohio. He was then picked up by the “Greater Sheesley Carnival,” but returned to Pittsburg after witnessing acts of racism in Cumberland, Maryland that significantly disturbed him. Eldridge soon found work leading a small band in the traveling “Rock Dinah” show, his performance therein leading swing-era bandleader Count Basie to recall young Roy Eldridge as “the greatest trumpet I’d ever heard in my life.” Eldridge continued playing with similar traveling groups until returning home to Pittsburgh at age seventeen.\n\nAt the age of twenty, Eldridge led a band in Pittsburgh, billed as “Roy Elliott and his Palais Royal Orchestra”, the agent intentionally changing Eldridge’s name because “he thought it more classy.” Roy left this position to try out for the orchestra of Horace Henderson, younger brother of famed New York bandleader Fletcher Henderson, and joined the ensemble, generally referred to as The Fletcher Henderson Stompers, Under the Direction of Horace Henderson. Eldridge then played with a number of other territory bands, staying for a short while in Detroit before joining Speed Webb’s band which, having garnered a degree of movie publicity, began a tour of the Midwest. Many of the members of Webb’s band, annoyed by the leader’s lack of dedication, left to form a practically identical group with Eldridge as bandleader. The ensemble was short-lived, and Eldridge soon moved to Milwaukee, where he took part in a celebrated cutting contest with trumpet player Cladys “Jabbo” Smith, with whom he later became good friends.\n\nNew York and Chicago\n\nEldridge moved to New York in November 1930, playing in various bands in the early 1930s, including a number of Harlem dance bands with Cecil Scott, Elmer Snowden, Charlie Johnson, and Teddy Hill. It was during this time that Eldridge received his nickname, ‘Little Jazz’, from Ellington saxophonist Otto Hardwick, who was amused by the incongruity between Eldridge’s raucous playing and his short stature. At this time, Eldridge was also making records and radio broadcasts under his own name. He laid down his first recorded solos with Teddy Hill in 1935, which gained almost immediate popularity. For a brief time, he also led his own band at the reputed Famous Door nightclub. Eldridge recorded a number of small group sides with singer Billie Holiday in July 1935, including “What a Little Moonlight Can Do” and “Miss Brown to You“, employing a Dixieland-influenced improvisation style. In October 1935, Eldridge joined Fletcher Henderson’s Orchestra, playing lead trumpet and occasionally singing. Until he left the group in early September 1936, Eldridge was Henderson’s featured soloist, his talent highlighted by such numbers as “Christopher Columbus” and “Blue Lou.” His rhythmic power to swing a band was a dynamic trademark of the jazz of the time. It has been said that “from the mid-Thirties onwards, he had superseded Louis Armstrong as the exemplar of modern ‘hot’ trumpet playing”.\n\nIn the fall of 1936, Eldridge moved to Chicago to form an octet with older brother Joe Eldridge playing saxophone and arranging. The ensemble boasted nightly broadcasts and made recordings that featured his extended solos, including “After You’ve Gone” and “Wabash Stomp.” Eldridge, fed up with the racism he had encountered in the music industry, quit playing in 1938 to study radio engineering. He was back to playing in 1939, when he formed a ten-piece band that gained a residency at New York’s Arcadia Ballroom.\n\nWith Gene Krupa’s Orchestra\n\nIn April 1941, after receiving many offers from white swing bands, Eldridge joined Gene Krupa‘s Orchestra, and was successfully featured with rookie singer Anita O’Day. In accepting this position, Eldridge became one of the first black musicians to become a permanent member of a white big band. Eldridge was instrumental in changing the course of Krupa’s big band from schmaltz to jazz. The group’s cover of Jimmy Dorsey‘s “Green Eyes,” previously an entirely orchestral work, was transformed into jazz via Eldridge’s playing; critic Dave Oliphant notes that Eldridge “lift[ed]” the tune “to a higher level of intensity.” Eldridge and O’Day were featured in a number of recordings including the novelty hit “Let Me Off Uptown” and “Knock Me With a Kiss”.\n\nOne of Eldridge’s best known recorded solos is on a rendition of Hoagy Carmichael‘s tune, “Rockin’ Chair”, arranged by Benny Carter as something like a concerto for Eldridge. Jazz historian Gunther Schuller referred to Eldridge’s solo on “Rockin’ Chair” as “a strong and at times tremendously moving performance,” although he disapproved of the “opening and closing cadenzas, the latter unforgivably aping the corniest of operatic cadenza traditions.” Critic and author Dave Oliphant describes Eldridge’s unique tone on “Rockin’ Chair” as “a raspy, buzzy tone, which enormously heightens his playing’s intensity, emotionally and dynamically” and writes that it “was also meant to hurt a little, to be disturbing, to express unfathomable stress.”\n\nAfter complaints from Eldridge that O’Day was upstaging him, the band broke up when Krupa was jailed for marijuana possession in July 1943.\n\nTouring, freelancing, and small group work\n\nAfter leaving Krupa’s band, Eldridge freelanced in New York during 1943 before joining Artie Shaw‘s band in 1944. Owing to racial incidents that he faced while playing in Shaw’s band, he left to form a big band, but this eventually proved financially unsuccessful, and Eldridge returned to small group work.\n\nIn the postwar years, he became part of the group which toured under the Jazz at the Philharmonic banner. and became one of the stalwarts of the tours. The JATP’s organiserNorman Granz said that Roy Eldridge typified the spirit of jazz. “Every time he’s on he does the best he can, no matter what the conditions are. And Roy is so intense about everything, so that it’s far more important to him to dare, to try to achieve a particular peak, even if he falls on his ass in the attempt, than it is to play safe. That’s what jazz is all about.”\n\nEldridge moved to Paris in 1950 while on tour with Benny Goodman, before returning to New York in 1951 to lead a band at the Birdland jazz club. He additionally performed from 1952 until the early sixties in small groups with Coleman Hawkins, Ella Fitzgerald and Earl Hines among others, and also began to record for Granz at this time. Eldridge also toured with Ella Fitzgerald from late 1963 until March 1965 and with Count Basie from July until September 1966 before returning to freelance playing and touring at festivals.\n\nRacial barriers\n\nAs the featured soloist in Artie Shaw and Gene Krupa’s bands, Eldridge was something of an exception, as black musicians in the 1930s were not allowed to appear in public with white bands. Artie Shaw commented on the difficulty Roy had in his band, noting that “Droves of people would ask him for his autograph at the end of the night, but later, on the bus, he wouldn’t be able to get off and buy a hamburger with the guys in the band.” Krupa, on at least one occasion, spent several hours in jail and paid fines for starting a fistfight with a restaurant manager who refused to let Eldridge eat with the rest of the band.\n\nLate life\n\nEldridge became the leader of the house band at Jimmy Ryan’s jazz club on Manhattan‘s West 54th Street for several years, beginning in 1969. Although Ryan’s was primarily aDixieland venue, Eldridge tried to combine the traditional Dixieland style with his own more brash and speedy playing. Eldridge was incapacitated by a stroke in 1970, but continued to lead the group at Ryan’s soon after and performing occasionally as a singer, drummer, and pianist. Writer Michael Zirpolo, seeing Eldridge at Ryan’s in the late 1970s noted “I was amazed that he still could pop out those piercing high notes, but he did, with frequency…I worried about his health, because the veins at his temples would bulge alarmingly.” As leader at Ryan’s, Eldridge was noted for his occasional hijinx, including impromptu “amateur night” sessions during which he’d invite inexperienced players on stage to lead his band, often for comedic effect and to give himself a break. In 1971, Eldridge was inducted into the Down Beat Jazz Hall of Fame.\n\nAfter suffering a heart attack in 1980, Eldridge gave up playing. He died at age 78 at the Franklin General Hospital in Valley Stream, New York, three weeks after the death of his wife, Viola.\n\nMusic\n\nInfluences\n\nAccording to Roy, his first major influence on the trumpet was Rex Stewart, who played in a band with young Roy and his brother Joe in Pittsburgh.[42] But unlike many trumpet players, the young Eldridge did not derive most of his inspiration from other trumpeters, but from saxophonists. Roy first developed his solo style by playing along to recordings ofColeman Hawkins and Benny Carter, and later said that, after hearing these musicians, “I resolved to play my trumpet like a sax.” Following these musicians was evidently beneficial to Roy, who got one of his first jobs by auditioning with an imitation of Coleman Hawkin’s solo on Fletcher Henderson’s “Stampede” of 1926. Eldridge additionally purports to have studied the styles of white cornettist Loring “Red” Nichols and Theodore “Cuban” Bennett, whose style was also very much influenced by the saxophone. Eldridge, by his own report, was not significantly influenced by trumpeter Louis Armstrong during his early years, but did undertake a major study of Armstrong’s style in 1932.\n\nStyle\n\nEldridge was very versatile on his horn, not only quick and articulate with the low to middle registers, but the high registers as well; jazz critic Gary Giddins described Eldridge as having a “flashy, passionate, many-noted style that rampaged freely through three octaves, rich with harmonic ideas impervious to the fastest tempos.” Eldridge is frequently grouped among those jazz trumpeters of the ’30s and ’40s, including Red Allen, Hot Lips Page, Shad Collins, and Rex Stewart who eschewed Louis Armstrong’s lyrical style for a rougher and more frantic style. Of these players, critic Gary Giddins names Eldridge “the most emotionally compelling, versatile, rugged, and far-reaching.” Eldridge was also lauded for the intensity of his playing; Ella Fitzgerald once said: “He’s got more soul in one note that a lot of people could get into the whole song.” The high register lines that Eldridge employed were one of many prominent features of his playing, and Eldridge expressed a penchant for the expressive ability of the instrument’s highest notes, frequently incorporating them into his solos. Eldridge was also known for his fast style of playing, often executing blasts of rapid double-time notes followed by a return to standard time. His rapid-fire style was noted by jazz trumpeter Bill Coleman when Roy was as young as seventeen; when asked by Coleman how he achieved his speed, Eldridge replied: “Well, I’ve taken the tops off my valves and now they really fly.” Eldridge attributes these virtuosic elements of his style to a rigorous practice regime, particularly as a teen: “I used to spend eight, nine hours a day practicing every day.” Critic J. Bradford Robinson sums up his style of playing as exhibiting “a keen awareness of harmony, an unprecedented dexterity, particularly in the highest register, and a full, slightly overblown timbre, which crackled at moments of high tension.” Giddins also notes that Eldridge “never had a pure or golden tone; his sound was always underscored by a vocal rasp, an urgent, human roughness.”\n\nAs for Eldridge’s singing style, jazz critic Whitney Balliett describes Eldridge as “a fine, scampish jazz singer, with a light, hoarse voice and a highly rhythmic attack,” comparing him to American jazz trumpeter and vocalist Hot Lips Page.\n\nMusical Impact\n\nEldridge’s fast playing and extensive development of the instrument’s upper register were heavy influences on Dizzy Gillespie, who, along with Charlie Parker, brought bebop into existence. Tracks such as “Heckler’s Hop,” from Eldridge’s small group recordings with alto saxophonist and clarinettist Scoops Carry, in which Eldridge’s use of the high register is particularly emphasized, were especially influential for Dizzy. Dizzy got the chance to engage in numerous jam sessions and “trumpet battles” with Eldridge at New York’sMinton’s Playhouse in the early 1940s. Referring to Eldridge, Dizzy went so far as to say: “He was the Messiah of our generation.” Eldridge first heard Dizzy on bandleaderLionel Hampton‘s 1939 recording of “Hot Mallets,” and later recalled: “I heard this trumpet solo and I thought it was me. Then I found out it was Dizzy.” A careful listening to bebop standards, such as the song “Bebop”, reveals how much Eldridge influenced this genre of jazz. Eldridge also claimed that he was not impressed with Dizzy’s bop solo style, saying once to bebop trumpeter Howard McGhee after jamming with Dizzy at the Heat Wave club in Harlem: “I don’t dig it…I really don’t understand him.” Although frequently touted as the bridge between Louis Armstrong and Dizzy Gillespie, Eldridge always insisted: “I was never trying to be a bridge between Armstrong and something.”\n\nIn modern jazz criticism, Eldridge has become something of a litmus test for jazz trumpeters. Critic Gunther Schuller, critiquing the style of multi-instrumentalist composer-arranger Benny Carter wrote that Carter’s playing is “not true trumpet playing, in the sense that Roy Eldridge’s or Buck Clayton‘s or Harry James‘s is.”\n\nOther significant musicians influenced by Roy Eldridge include Shorty Sherock of the Bob Crosby Orchestra, and bebop pioneers Howard McGhee and Fats Navarro.\n\nPersonality\n\nEldridge was famously considered competitive by those who knew him, pianist Chuck Folds saying, “I can’t imagine anyone more competitive than he [Roy] was in the 1970s. I’ve never met anyone scrappier than Roy, ever, ever, ever.” Eldridge fully admitted to his competitive spirit, saying “I was just trying to outplay anybody, and to outplay them my way.” Jazz trumpeter Jonah Jones reports that Eldridge’s willingness to “go anywhere and play against anyone” even led to a cutting contest with his own hero, Rex Stewart. Roy could also become antagonistic, particularly in the face of those he deemed racist. Many noted Roy’s constant restlessness, saxophonist Billie Bowen noting that Roy “could never, even as a youngster, sit down for more than a few minutes, he was always restless.” Eldridge is also said to have suffered from sporadic stage fright. He occasionally found himself in trouble with women, including an incident that involved his being forced to sell his trumpet temporarily in order to reclaim a portion of the money that had been stolen from him by a woman with whom he had drunkenly spent the night. Roy is also said to have developed a fiery temper later in life, according to clarinettist Joe Muranyi, who worked with Eldridge at Ryan’s and has called Elridge’s temper “Mt. Vesuvius to the fifth power.”\n\nPartial Discography\n\n(From left) Thelonious Monk, Howard McGhee, Roy Eldridge, Teddy Hill, Minton’s Playhouse, New York, N.Y., ca.

Forceful delivery, well-constructed improvisations, and a distinctive, wide vibrato characterized Bechet’s playing.\n\nBechet’s erratic temperament hampered his career, however, and not until the late 1940s did he earn wide acclaim.\n\nBiography\n\nBechet’s childhood home in the 7th Ward of New Orleans.\n\nBust in Juan-les-Pins\n\nBechet was born in New Orleans in 1897 to a middle-class Creole of color family. Sidney’s older brother Leonard Bechet (1877–1952) was a part-time trombonist and bandleader. Sidney Bechet quickly learned to play several musical instruments kept around the house, mostly by teaching himself; he soon decided to specialize in clarinet. At the age of six, Sidney started playing along with his brother’s band at a family birthday party, debuting his talents to acclaim. Later in his youth, Bechet studied with such renowned Creole clarinetists as Lorenzo Tio, “Big Eye” Louis Nelson Delisle, and George Baquet.\n\nSoon after, Bechet began to play in many New Orleans ensembles, improvising with what was “acceptable” for jazz at that time (obbligatos, with scales and arpeggios, and “variating” the melody). These ensembles included parade work with Henry Allen’s celebrated Brass Band, the Olympia Orchestra, and John Robichaux’s “genteel” dance orchestra. In 1911-1912, Bechet performed with Bunk Johnson in the Eagle Band of New Orleans, and in 1913-1914, with King Oliver in the Olympia Band.\n\nAlthough Bechet spent his childhood and adolescence in New Orleans, from 1914 to 1917 he was touring and traveling, going as far north as Chicago, and frequently teaming up with Freddie Keppard, another notable Creole musician. In the spring of 1919, Bechet traveled to New York, where he joined Will Marion Cook‘s Syncopated Orchestra. Soon after, the orchestra journeyed to Europe where, almost immediately upon arrival, they performed at the Royal Philharmonic Hall in London. The group was warmly received, and Bechet was especially popular, attracting attention near and far.\n\nWhile in London, Bechet discovered the straight soprano saxophone, and quickly developed a style quite unlike his warm, reedy clarinet tone. His saxophone sound could be described as “emotional”, “reckless”, and “large”. He would often use a very broad vibrato, similar to what was common for some New Orleans clarinetists at the time.\n\nAfter being convicted of assaulting a woman, Bechet was imprisoned in London from September 13 to 26, 1922. He was deported back to the United States, leaving Southampton on November 3 and arriving in New York on November 13, 1922.\n\nOn July 30, 1923, he began recording; it is some of his earliest surviving studio work. The session was led by Clarence Williams, a pianist and songwriter, better known at that time for his music publishing and record producing. Bechet recorded “Wild Cat Blues” and “Kansas City Man Blues”. “Wild Cat Blues” is in a multi-thematic ragtime tradition, with four themes, at sixteen bars each, and “Kansas City Man Blues” is a genuine 12-bar blues. Bechet interpreted and played each uniquely, and with outstanding creativity and innovation for the time.\n\nOn September 15, 1925, Bechet and other members of the Revue Nègre, including Josephine Baker, sailed to Europe, arriving atCherbourg, France, on September 22. The revue opened at the Théâtre des Champs-Élysées, Paris, on October 2. Bechet toured Europe with various bands, reaching as far as Russia in mid-1926. In 1928, he led his own small band at the famous Bricktop’s Club inMontmartre, Paris.\n\nBechet was jailed in Paris when a woman passer-by was wounded during a shoot-out. The most common version of the story, as related in Ken Burns‘s jazz documentary, reports that the initial shoot-out started when another musician/producer told Bechet that he was playing the wrong chord. Bechet challenged the man to a duel. Other sources assert that Bechet was essentially ambushed by a rival musician.\n\nAfter his release, Bechet was deported to New York. Having arrived right after the stock-market crash of 1929, Bechet joined Noble Sissle’s orchestra. They returned to Europe to tour in Berlin, Germany and Russia.\n\nIn 1932, Bechet returned to New York City to lead a band with trumpeter Tommy Ladnier. The band, consisting of six members, performed at the Savoy Ballroom. He went on to play with Lorenzo Tio, and also got to know Roy Eldridge, another trumpeter.\n\nOver time Bechet had increasing difficulty finding musical gigs; he eventually started a tailor shop with Ladnier. During this time, they were visited by various musicians, and played in the back of their shop. Throughout the 1940s, Bechet played in several bands, but his financial situation did not change until the end of that decade.\n\nBy the end of the 1940s, Bechet tired of struggling to make music in the United States. His contract with Jazz Limited, a Chicago-based record label, was limiting the events where he could perform, for instance excluding the 1948 Festival of Europe in Nice. He believed that the jazz scene in the US had little left to offer him and that was getting stale.\n\nBechet relocated to France in 1950 after performing as a soloist at the Paris Jazz Fair. His performance at the fair resulted in a surge in his popularity in France. After that, Bechet had little problem finding well-paid work in France. In 1951, Bechet married Elisabeth Ziegler in Antibes, France.\n\nIn 1953, he signed a recording contract with French Vogue, which lasted for the rest of his life. He recorded many hit tunes, including “Les Oignons“, “Promenade aux Champ Elysees,” and the international hit “Petite Fleur“. He also composed a classical ballet score in the late Romantic style of Tchaikovsky, called La Nuit est sorcière (The Night Is a Witch). Existentialists in France called him “le dieu”.\n\nBechet died in Paris from lung cancer on May 14, 1959 on his sixty-second birthday. Shortly before his death, he dictated his poetic autobiography, Treat It Gentle.\n\nCareer\n\nBechet successfully composed in jazz, pop-tune, and extended concert work forms. He knew how to read music but chose not to, due to his highly developed inner ear; he developed his own fingering system and never played section parts in a big band or swing-style combo. His recordings have often been reissued.\n\nSidney Bechet’s primary instruments were the clarinet and the soprano sax. His playing style is intense and passionate, and had a wide vibrato. He was also known to be very proficient with his instruments and a master at improvisation (both individual and collective). Bechet liked to have his sound dominate in a performance, and trumpeters found it very difficult to play alongside him.\n\nBechet’s song Si tu vois ma mère was prominently featured in the Woody Allen film Midnight in Paris (2011).\n\nSome of the highlights of his career include 1923 sides with Louis Armstrong in the Clarence Williams Blue Five; the 1932, 1940, 1941 New Orleans Feetwarmers sides; a 1938 Tommy Ladnier Orchestra session (“Weary Blues”, “Really the Blues”); a hit 1939 recording of “Summertime“; and various versions of his own composition, “Petite Fleur“.\n\nIn 1939, Bechet co-led a group with pianist Willie “The Lion” Smith that recorded several early versions of what was later called Latin jazz, adapting traditional méringue, rhumbaand Haitian songs to the jazz idiom.\n\nBechet in New York in 1947\n\nOn July 28, 1940, Sidney Bechet made a guest appearance on NBC Radio‘s The Chamber Music Society of Lower Basin Street show, playing two of his show pieces (“Shake It and Break It” and “St. Louis Blues“) with Henry Levine’s Dixieland band. Levine invited Bechet into the RCA Victor recording studio (on 24th Street in New York City), where Bechet lent his soprano sax to Levine’s traditional arrangement of “Muskrat Ramble.”\n\nOn April 18, 1941, as an early experiment in overdubbing at Victor, Bechet recorded a version of the pop song “The Sheik of Araby“, playing six different instruments: clarinet, soprano saxophone, tenor saxophone, piano, bass, and drums. A hitherto unissued master of this recording was included in the 1965 LP Bechet of New Orleans, issued by RCA Victor as LPV-510. On the liner notes, George Hoeffer quotes Bechet as follows:\n\n“I started by playing The Sheik on piano, and played the drums while listening to the piano. I meant to play all the rhythm instruments, but got all mixed up and grabbed my soprano, then the bass, then the tenor saxophone, and finally finished up with the clarinet.”\n\nIn 1944, 1946, and 1953 he recorded and performed in concert with the Chicago jazz pianist and vibraphonist Max Miller, private recordings that are part of the Max Miller archive and have never been released. These concerts and recordings are covered completely inJohn Chilton‘s authoritative book on Bechet.\n\nBechet was an important influence on the alto saxophonist Johnny Hodges, who studied with him as a teenager.\n\nLegacy and honors\n\nIn 1919, Ernest Ansermet, a Swiss classical conductor, wrote a tribute to Bechet, one of the earliest (if not the first) to a jazz musician from the classical field of music, linking Bechet’s music with that of Bach.\n\nIn 1968, Bechet was inducted into the Down Beat Jazz Hall of Fame.\n\nThe New York Times music writer Robert Palmer wrote of Bechet: “by combining the ‘cry’ of the blues players and the finesse of the Creoles into his ‘own way,’ Sidney Bechet created a style which moved the emotions even as it dazzled the mind.”\n\n“Bechet to me was the very epitome of jazz … everything he played in his whole life was completely original. I honestly think he was the most unique man to ever be in this music.” — Duke Ellington.\n\nThe British poet Philip Larkin wrote an ode to Bechet in The Whitsun Weddings.\n\nIn popular culture\n\nSugar Blue, the renowned blues harmonica player, took his name from the Bechet recording “Sugar Blues”, saying:\n\n“I needed a nickname … all the good ones were taken! You know ‘Muddy Waters’, ‘Blind Lemon’, ‘Sonny Boy’ … until one night a friend and I were leaving a concert — a Doc Watson concert — when somebody threw out of the window a box full of old 78s: I picked one up and it said “Sugar Blues” by Sidney Bechet … That’s it! I thought it was perfect … so here I am”.\n\nBechet is said to have inspired the character of the saxophonist “Pablo” in the novel Steppenwolf. Hermann Hesse likely learned about jazz by listening to his playing in Europe in the 1920s.\n\nIn the novel Replay by Ken Grimwood, Bechet is featured performing at an underground Paris jazz club in the novel. This appearance is anachronistic as the scene takes place in 1963; Bechet died in 1959.\n\nIn music\n\nBob Dorough, who played with Bechet, recorded a tribute song, called “Something for Sydney,” on his Right On My Way Home album.\n\nVan Morrison mentions Bechet in his song “See Me Through Part II (Just A Closer Walk With Thee)”.\n\nThe French chanteuse Patricia Kaas recorded the song, “L’Enterrement de Sidney Bechet” (“The Funeral of Sidney Bechet”), on her 1990 album Scène de vie.\n\nRaquel Bitton pays tribute to Sydney Bechet in her CD Paris Blues, singing “Petite Fleur” (2006).\n\nRadiohead used his single “Egyptian Fantasy” as the exit song for their 2012 tour.\n\nIn film/TV\n\nIn the 1997 documentary Wild Man Blues, Woody Allen, the director and clarinetist, repeatedly referred to Bechet. He named one of his children adopted with his wife Soon-Yi Previn after Bechet.\n\nBechet is portrayed by Jeffrey Wright in two episodes of the television series The Young Indiana Jones Chronicles.\n\nIn the 2009 Disney animated feature The Princess and the Frog, Bechet is mentioned by Louis, the trumpet playing alligator, during the musical number “When We’re Human.”\n\nPartial discography\n\nSingles\n\n“Texas Moaner Blues” (recorded with Louis Armstrong) – 1924\n\n“Cake Walkin’ Babies from Home” (with Red Onion Jazz Babies) – 1925\n\n“Blues In Thirds” – 1940\n\n“Dear Old Southland” – 1940\n\n“Egyptian Fantasy” -1941\n\n“Muskrat Ramble” – 1944\n\n“Blue Horizon” – 1944\n\nGene Krupa Background information Birth name Eugene Bertram Krupa Born January 15, 1909\n\nChicago, Illinois, U.S. Died October 16, 1973 (aged 64)\n\nYonkers, New York, U.S. Genres Jazz, swing, dixieland, big band Occupations Drummer, composer, bandleader Instruments Drums Years active 1920s–1973 Associated acts Eddie Condon, Benny Goodman,Louie Bellson, Anita O’Day\n\nEugene Bertram “Gene” Krupa (January 15, 1909 – October 16, 1973) was an American jazz and big band drummer and composer, known for his highly energetic and flamboyant style.\n\nEarly Life\n\nKrupa was born in Chicago, the youngest of Anna (Oslowski) and Bartłomiej Krupa’s nine children. Krupa’s father, Bartłomiej, was an immigrant from Poland, and his mother, Anna, was born in Shamokin, Pennsylvania, of Polish descent. His parents were very religious and had groomed Gene for the priesthood. He spent his grammar school days at various parochial schools and upon graduation, attended Saint Joseph’s College for a year, but later decided it was not his vocation. He studied with Sanford A. Moeller and began playing professionally in the mid-1920s with bands in Wisconsin. He broke into the Chicago scene in 1927, when he was picked byMCA to become a member of “Thelma Terry and Her Playboys,” the first notable American Jazz band (outside of all-girl bands) to be led by a female musician. The Playboys were the house band at The Golden Pumpkin nightclub in Chicago and also toured extensively throughout the eastern and central United States.\n\nCareer\n\nHe made his first recordings in 1927, with a band under the leadership of banjoist Eddie Condon and Red McKenzie: along with other recordings beginning in 1924 by musicians known in the “Chicago” scene such as Bix Beiderbecke, these sides are examples of “Chicago Style” jazz. The numbers recorded at that session were: “China Boy“, “Sugar”, “Nobody’s Sweetheart” and “Liza”. The McKenzie – Condon sides are also notable for being some of the early examples of the use of a full drum kit on recordings. Krupa’s big influences during this time were Tubby Hall and Zutty Singleton. The drummer who probably had the greatest influence on Gene in this period was Baby Dodds, whose use of press rolls was highly reflected in Gene’s playing.\n\nKrupa also appeared on six recordings made by the Thelma Terry band in 1928 In 1934 he joined Benny Goodman‘s band, where his featured drum work made him a national celebrity. His tom-tom interludes on their hit “Sing, Sing, Sing” were the first extended drum solos to be recorded commercially. He made a cameo appearance in the 1941 film, Ball of Fire, in which he and his band performed an extended version of the hit “Drum Boogie”, sung by Barbara Stanwyck, which he had composed with trumpeter Roy Eldridge.\n\nAs the 1940s ended, large orchestras fell by the wayside: Count Basie closed his large band and Woody Herman reduced his to an octet. Krupa gradually cut down the size of the band in the late 1940s, and from 1951 on led a trio or quartet, often featuring the multi-instrumentalist Eddie Shu on tenor sax, clarinet and harmonica. He appeared regularly with the Jazz At the Philharmonic shows. Along with Ball of Fire, he made a cameo appearance in the 1946 screen classic The Best Years Of Our Lives. His athletic drumming style, timing methods and cymbal technique evolved during this decade to fit in with changed fashions and tastes, but he never quite adjusted to the Be-Bop period.\n\nIn 1954, Krupa returned to Hollywood, to appear in such films as The Glenn Miller Story and The Benny Goodman Story. In 1959, the movie biography, The Gene Krupa Story, was released; Sal Mineo portrayed Krupa, and the film had a cameo appearance by Red Nichols. Dave Frishberg, a pianist who played with Krupa, was particularly struck by the accuracy of one key moment in the film. “The scene where the Krupa character drops his sticks during the big solo, and the audience realizes that he’s “back on the stuff.” I remember at least a couple of occasions in real life when Gene dropped a stick, and people in the audience began whispering among themselves and pointing at Gene.”\n\nHe continued to perform in famous clubs in the 1960s including the legendary Show Boat Lounge in suburban Maryland (which burned to the ground in the race riots of 1968), and the Metropole, near Times Square in New York City, often playing duets with drummer Cozy Cole. Increasingly troubled by back pain, he retired in the late 1960s and opened a music school. One of his pupils was KISS drummer Peter Criss, whilst Jerry Nolan from The New York Dolls was another, as evidenced by the drumming similarities between KISS’s “Black Diamond” and The New York Dolls’ “Jet Boy”.\n\nHe occasionally played in public in the early 1970s until shortly before his death. One such late appearance occurred in 1972 at a jazz concert series sponsored by the New Schoolin New York. Krupa appeared on stage with other well-known musicians including trumpeter Harry James and the younger jazz star saxophonist Gerry Mulligan. A presumption was that the 500 or so audience members were drawn by Mulligan’s contemporary appeal. Nevertheless, when, during the second tune, Krupa took a 16 bar break, the room essentially exploded, the crowd leaping to its feet creating a deafening roar of unanimous affection; in effect he remained a seminal performer up to his death, even while playing for a huge audience perhaps half his age.\n\nThe Krupa-Rich ‘drum battles’\n\nNorman Granz recruited Krupa and fellow drummer Buddy Rich for his Jazz at The Philharmonic concerts. It was suggested that the two perform a ‘drum battle’ at the Carnegie Hall concert in September 1952, which was recorded and later issued on vinyl (a CD edition called The Drum Battle at JATP appeared courtesy of Verve in 1999). Further drum battles took place at subsequent JATP concerts; the two drummers also faced off in a number of television broadcasts.\n\nKrupa and Rich recorded two studio albums together; the first was titled Krupa and Rich (Verve, 1955) and the second called Burnin’ Beat (Verve, 1962).\n\nPersonal Life\n\nKrupa married Ethel Maguire twice: the first marriage lasted from 1934–1942; the second one dates from 1946 to her death in 1955. Their relationship was dramatized in the biopic about him. Krupa remarried in 1959 (to Patty Bowler).\n\nIn 1943, Krupa was arrested for possession of two marijuana cigarettes and was given a three-month jail sentence.\n\nKrupa died of leukemia and heart failure in Yonkers, New York, aged 64. He was buried in Holy Cross Cemetery in Calumet City, Illinois.\n\nLegacy\n\nGene Krupa Drive in Yonkers, New York\n\nIn the 1930s, Krupa prominently featured Slingerland drums. At Krupa’s urging, Slingerland developed tom-toms with tuneable top and bottom heads, which immediately became important elements of virtually every drummer’s set-up. Krupa developed and popularized many of the cymbal techniques that became standards. His collaboration with Armand Zildjian of the Avedis Zildjian Company developed the modernhi-hat cymbals and standardized the names and uses of the ride cymbal, the crash cymbal, the splash cymbal, the pang cymbal and theswish cymbal. One of his drum sets, a Slingerland inscribed with Benny Goodman’s and Krupa’s initials, is preserved at the Smithsonianmuseum in Washington, D.C.\n\nKrupa was featured in the 1946 Warner Bros. cartoon Book Revue in which a rotoscoped version of Krupa’s drumming is used in an impromptu jam session.\n\nThe 1937 recording of Louis Prima‘s “Sing, Sing, Sing (With a Swing)” by Benny Goodman and His Orchestra featuring Gene Krupa on drums was inducted into the Grammy Hall of Fame in 1982.\n\nIn 1959, The Gene Krupa Story was released theatrically in America.\n\nGene Krupa’s “Syncopated Style” is mentioned by a street musician in the 1976 film Taxi Driver.\n\nIn 1978, Krupa became the first drummer inducted into the Modern Drummer Hall of Fame.\n\nKrupa was mentioned in the animated dark comedy/action series Archer episode “Dial M for Mother”, when Sterling Archer is querying his mother (Malory Archer) on his father’s identity. After Sterling shows his disgust that his father may be the head of either of their top two rival espionage organizations, Malory indicates that there are other possibilities. Sterling asks Malory, “Who else?”. “Gene Krupa.” “WHAT the drummer?” “No, wait not Gene Krupa the other one with the teeth. Buddy Rich. I could never say ‘No’ to a drummer.”\n\nKrupa was mentioned in the Simpsons episode “Hurricane Neddy”, when Ned Flanders parents are being told they must control Ned, Ned’s father responds “We can’t do it man! That’s discipline! That’s like tellin’ Gene Krupa not to go “Boom boom bah bah bah, boom boom bah bah bah, boom boom boom bah bah bah bah, boom boom tss!””.\n\nKrupa was mentioned in ’90s sitcom Freaks & Geeks Nick Andapolis, played by Jason Segel, is listening to Rush and Linsday’s father, Harold, tells him that what he’s listening to “isn’t real drumming” and whoever that is “couldn’t drum his way out of a paper bag,” and then proceeds to show him a Gene Krupa and Buddy Rich album. Nick is blown away by the speed and precision of Krupa’s music.

His was one of the most prolific black orchestras and his influence was vast. He was often known as “Smack” Henderson (apparently named due to his college baseball hitting skills). Fletcher is ranked along with Duke Ellington as one of the most influential arrangers and band leaders in jazz history, and helped bridge the gap between the jazz and swing era.\n\nBiography\n\nBuilt by his father in 1888, this house inCuthbert, Georgia is where Fletcher Henderson was born in 1897. The house was added to the National Register of Historic Places on June 17, 1982.\n\nFletcher Henderson was born in Cuthbert, Georgia. His father, Fletcher H. Henderson Sr. (1857–1943), was the principal of the nearby Howard Normal Randolph School from 1880 until 1942.\n\nHenderson attended Atlanta University in Atlanta, Georgia and graduated in 1920. After graduation, he moved to New York City to attend Columbia University for a master’s degree in chemistry. However, he found his job prospects in chemistry to be very restricted due to his race, and turned to music for a living.\n\nHe was recording director for the fledgling Black Swan label from 1921–1923. Throughout the early and mid-1920s, Henderson provided solo piano accompanyment for many blues singers. He also led the backing group for Ethel Waters during one of her national tours. Henderson’s group was not technically a jazz band yet (more like a dance band), though its music was inflected with the ragtime rhythms that had been popular for some time. In 1922 he formed his own band, which was resident first at the Club Alabam, then at the Roseland Ballroom, and quickly became known as the best African-American band in New York. Even though he did not do band arrangements in the 1920s, for a time his ideas of arrangement were heavily influenced by those of Paul Whiteman. But when Louis Armstrong joined his orchestra in 1924, Henderson realized there could be a much richer potential for jazz band orchestration. Henderson’s band also boasted the formidable arranging talents of Don Redman (from 1922 to 1927). After Redman’s departure from the band in 1927, Henderson took on the majority of the arranging, although Benny Carter contributed several important scores from 1930–31, and Henderson also bought scores from freelance musicians. As an arranger, Henderson came into his own in the mid-1930s.\n\nHis band circa 1925 included Howard Scott, Coleman Hawkins (who started with Henderson in 1923 playing the low tuba parts on bass saxophone and quickly moved to tenor and a leading solo role), Louis Armstrong, Charlie Dixon, Kaiser Marshall, Buster Bailey, Elmer Chambers, Charlie Green, Ralph Escudero and Don Redman.\n\nIn 1925, along with fellow composer Henry Troy, he wrote “Gin House Blues“, recorded by Bessie Smith and Nina Simone amongst others. His other compositions include the very popular jazz composition “Soft Winds”.\n\nHenderson recorded extensively in the 1920s for numerous labels, including Vocalion, Paramount, Columbia, Olympic, Ajax, Pathe, Perfect, Edison, Emerson, Brunswick, Plaza Records and its subsidiary imprints Banner and Oriole. From 1925–1930, he recorded primarily for Columbia, and Brunswick/ Vocalion under his own name, as well as recording a series of acoustic recordings under the name The Dixie Stompers for Columbia’s Harmony and associated dime store labels (Diva and Velvet Tone). During the 1930s, he recorded for Columbia, Crown (as “Connie’s Inn Orchestra”), ARC (Melotone, Perfect, Oriole, etc.), Victor, Vocalion and Decca. Starting in the very early 1920’s, Henderson recorded current popular hits, as well as jazz tunes. (As an example of how prolific his band was, in 1924, he recorded 80 individual sides. His version of the pop tune, “I Can’t Get The One I Want”, recorded c. June 19, 1924 was issued on at least 23 different labels!)\n\nAt one time or another, in addition to Armstrong, lead trumpeters included Henry “Red” Allen, Joe Smith, Rex Stewart, Tommy Ladnier, Doc Cheatham and Roy Eldridge. Lead saxophonists included Coleman Hawkins, Buster Bailey, Benny Carter and Chu Berry. Sun Ra also worked as an arranger during the 1940s, during Henderson’s engagement at theClub DeLisa in Chicago. Sun Ra himself said that on first hearing Henderson’s orchestra as a teenager he assumed that they must be angels because no human could produce such beautiful music.\n\nBeginning in the early 1930s, Fletcher’s piano-playing younger brother, Horace Henderson contributed to the arrangements of the band. At different times in Horace’s career, he was Billie Holiday’s and Lena Horne’s pianist. Later, he led a band of his own that also received critical acclaim.\n\nAlthough Fletcher’s band was quite popular, he had little success in managing it. But much of his lack of recognition outside of Harlem had to do more with the times in which he lived, and the hard times that resulted after the 1929 stock market crash. However, because many of Henderson’s records (Columbia, Brunswick, Vocalion, Victor and those issued on the many of the dime store labels) still turn up at junk stores, flea markets, collectors stores, on eBay and on private record auctions, there’s no denying how popular his band truly was.\n\nAfter about 1931, his own arrangements became influential. In addition to his own band, he arranged for several others, including those of Teddy Hill, Isham Jones and, most famously, Benny Goodman. Henderson’s wife, Leora, said that a major turning point in his life was an auto accident which happened in 1928. Henderson’s shoulder was injured, and he apparently sustained a concussion. Leora claimed that Fletcher was never the same, and that after this point he lost his ambition and became careless. According to Leora, the accident was a major cause of Henderson’s diminishing success. She also claims that John Hammond and Benny Goodman arranged to buy Henderson’s arrangements as a way to support him, and points out that Goodman always gave Henderson credit for the arrangements, and said that the Henderson band played them better than his own. In addition, Goodman and Hammond arranged broadcasts and recordings to benefit Henderson when he was ill.\n\nBenny Goodman\n\nIn 1935, Goodman’s Orchestra was selected as a house band for the “Let’s Dance” radio program. Since Goodman needed new charts every week for the show, his friend John Hammond suggested that he purchase some from Henderson. Many of Goodman’s hits from the swing era were played by Henderson and his own band in the late 1920s and early 1930s, and usually were head arrangements that Fletcher transcribed from his own records, then sold to Goodman. However, brother Horace Henderson recounts (in Goodman’s biography “Swing, Swing, Swing” by Ross Firestone) that the clarinettist made heavy demands on Henderson for fresh charts while his band was engaged for the “Let’s Dance” show in 1934, and that he himself contributed to help Fletcher complete some of them. Vocalist Helen Ward also states that Henderson was delighted to hear the Goodman orchestra realise his creations with such impeccable musicianship.\n\nIn 1939, Henderson disbanded his band and joined Goodman’s, first as pianist and arranger and then working full-time as staff arranger. He re-formed bands of his own several times in the 1940s and toured with Ethel Waters again in 1948–1949. Henderson suffered a stroke in 1950, resulting in partial paralysis that ended his days as a pianist. He died in New York City in 1952.\n\nContributions to jazz\n\nHenderson, along with Don Redman, established the formula for swing music. The two broke the band into sections (sax section, trumpet section etc.). These sections worked together to create a unique sound. Sometimes, the sections would play in call-and-response style, and at other times one section would play supporting riffs behind the other. Swing, its popularity spanning over a decade, was the most fashionable form of jazz ever in the United States.\n\nHenderson was also responsible for bringing Louis Armstrong from Chicago to New York in October 1924, thus flipping the focal point of jazz in the history of the United States (although Armstrong left the band in November 1925 and returned to Chicago).\n\nHenderson also played a key role in bringing improvisatory jazz styles from New Orleans and other areas of the country to New York, where they merged with a dance-band tradition that relied heavily on arrangements written out in musical notation.\n\nA museum is being established in his memory in Cuthbert, Georgia."
