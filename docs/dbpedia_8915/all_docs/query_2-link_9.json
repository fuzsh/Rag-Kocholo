        "text": "Jill aged 3 years old\n\nShe toured twice with a production of Hello Dolly! firstly in 1965, as a member of the ensemble cast in 1as character Irene Molley and again almost thirty years later in 1994 in the leading role. Perryman although a staple of theatre, has appeared in numerous guest roles in television series and briefly in film making her debut in Maybe This Time in 1980.\n\nPerryman was born in Melbourne to a family notable for its achievements in theatre and entertainment. Her father, William Thomas Perryman, was an actor and performer, with notable credits from 1919 until 1938 and her mother Dorothy Eileen (formerly Duvall), born in Adelaide was an actress and singer, who appeared in a few productions from 1923 until 1932. Her older sister, Diana Perryman (1925–1979), was prominent in Australian theatre and also appeared in television roles and was posthumously awarded an MBE.\n\nJill & Kevan\n\nPerryman in 1952, then aged 19, joined the company of J. C. Williamson Theatres Ltd as a member of the chorus and in the following year was understudying leading roles in stage musicals, under Evie Hayes in a local production of Call Me Madam. In 1959 she married Kevan Johnston, a dancer and choreographer. Their successful personal and professional partnership continues to this day. They have two children, Tod Andrew and Trudy Jane.\n\nPerryman was strong in voice and personality, and a long series of understudy and small roles eventually led her, through the recommendation of John McCallum (who was then joint managing director of J. C. Williamson Theatres Ltd), to take the lead in the key Australian production of Funny Girl, a performance that won her an Erik Award for Best Actress and led to major roles in other productions.\n\nHere's \"Send In The Clowns\" from A Little Night Music\n\nThese included I Do! I Do! in 1969; The Two of Us in 1971. No, No, Nanette in 1972 won her another Erik Award for Best Actress for her role as Lucille Early, then in 1973 she starred in A Little Night Music. During this time, Jill made regular guest appearances on television variety programs and starred in her own series on ABC TV called Perryman On Parade (1973) for which she won a Penguin Award for Best Variety Performer. This was followed by Jill (1975) and An Evening With Jill Perryman (1977). She also recorded her first record with EMI entitled I Feel A Song Coming On in 1974 followed by Leading Lady in 1975.\n\nIn 1976 she played Gladys Zilch in Leading Lady, a musical production created especially for her. She also toured during 1977 in Side by Side by Sondheim. She played Miss Hannigan in Annie in 1978. She toured in the musicals Chicago in 1988 and The Boy From Oz in 1998. These shows had extended national tours and Jill received a Green Room Award for each role, along with a Sidney Myer Performing Arts Award for Best Musical Theatre Performer for the role of Dolly Levi.\n\nAmong her many accolades she was awarded an MBE in 1979, the AACTA Award for Best Actress in a Supporting Role in 1980, the Order Of Australia in 1992 and in October 2013 Jill and her husband Kevan Johnston jointly received the Australian Equity Foundation\"s Lifetime Achievement Award at a presentation on the stage of Her Majesty\"s Theatre in Melbourne. In 2018 Jill and Kevan both received honorary doctorates at an Edith Cowan University graduation.\n\n‘I’ve been blessed all along the way,’ says Jill. ‘I wouldn’t change anything. And I think it’s because I’ve been able to combine a career with my wonderful family.’\n\n(Edited from Wikipedia, The Arts Centre & westpix)\n\nLadnier was born in Mandeville, Louisiana – located on the north shore of Lake Pontchartrain, with New Orleans on the opposite shore. Beginning 1914, Ladnier performed in Mandeville's Independence Band at the Dew Drop Dance Hall, led by clarinetist Isidore Frick. Trumpeter Bunk Johnson sometimes played with this band and gave young Ladnier lessons. In 1917, Ladnier moved with his mother to Chicago and worked in the stock yards.\n\nLadnier married Daisy Mathews on February 1, 1920, in Chicago. Around 1921, he became a professional musician. He played for some time in St. Louis with Charlie Creath. Beginning in 1923, he played in Chicago and made many recordings for Paramount Records with pianist Lovie Austin, accompanying blues singers Ma Rainey, Ida Cox, and Alberta Hunter.\n\nFor some time, Ladnier played with his inspiration, King Oliver. He emulated Oliver's freak style on the solo in \"Play that Thing\" with Ollie Power's Harmony Syncopators in September 1923. On March 13, 1923, in Chicago, Ladnier's mother, Willie Ladnier died from a gunshot at a party quarrel.\n\nLadnier joined pianist Sam Wooding in 1925 for an extensive tour of Germany, Sweden, Denmark, Spain, and Russia. This orchestra recorded in Berlin. He returned to New York and became the hot soloist for the Fletcher Henderson orchestra from 1926–1927. He returned to the Sam Wooding Orchestra for another tour of Germany, Austria, Turkey, Switzerland, Italy, and France, then left in January 1929 to work freelance in Paris.\n\nLadnier in white suit with Sam Wooding's Orchestra\n\nA short tour with dancer Harry Fleming brought him to Spain, where he met dancer Louis Douglas and joined him in November 1929 in Paris, acting as orchestra leader. He again free-lanced in Paris until summer 1930 when he joined the Noble Sissle dance band, performing in Paris and London.\n\nTommy Ladnier’s recordings with Paramount Records earned him the name “The Praying Cornet.” During this period, he developed a more direct style inspired by Louis Armstrong, which he later refined into a forerunner of the swing style. Ladnier’s use of syncopations was outstanding and his intensity sometimes overwhelming. In his last recordings his playing is more simplified. Ladnier was a true jazz improviser whose varied playing can be heard in the many alternate take recordings. Tommy Ladnier also learned during his European years that skin colour was not so important there and he loved the “colour-blind” Frenchmen.\n\nHe returned to U.S. at the end of 1930 and stayed with Sissle until January 1932. The Sissle orchestra made some recordings in London and New York. Back in America in 1932, Ladnier and Sidney Bechet formed the New Orleans Feetwarmers. During the Depression, they tried to run a tailor shop in Harlem, but neither was interested in business. Ladnier left New York and played in the east, sometimes giving trumpet lessons. For a year, he lived in Stamford, Connecticut.\n\nIn 1938, Hugues Panassié, a French critic and record producer who met Ladnier in Paris in 1930, visited New York. He found Ladnier and recorded the Panassié Sessions with Sidney Bechet and Mezz Mezzrow. Ladnier and Bechet participated in the first From Spirituals to Swing concert arranged by John Hammond in December 1938. Ladnier's last studio recording was on February 1, 1939, in New York as a sideman with singer Rosetta Crawford accompanied by James P. Johnson's Hep Cats.\n\nMezzrow, Panassie & Laddnier\n\nAt age 39, Ladnier, died unexpectedly of a heart attack June 4, 1939, while staying at Mezz Mezzrow's apartment at 1 West 126th Street, which was a six-story, 48-unit residential building in the Harlem neighborhood of Manhattan. It fell upon Mezzrow to take care of Ladnier's belongings and bury him. The memorial service was on Friday, June 9, 1939. Ladnier was buried at Frederick Douglass Memorial Park, Staten Island, an African American cemetery.\n\nDespite efforts by Mezzrow and friends, the grave remained unmarked for nearly 69 years until a marker carved from Nero Granite was engraved by Bob Sprauge and was placed on site by Bob Lang in 2008.\n\n(Edited from Wikipedia & blackpast org.)\n\nShank ultimately abandoned the flute to focus exclusively on playing jazz on the alto saxophone. He also recorded on tenor and baritone sax. His most famous recording is probably the version of \"Harlem Nocturne\" used as the theme song in Mickey Spillane's Mike Hammer. He is also well known for the alto flute solo on the song \"California Dreamin'\" recorded by The Mamas & the Papas in 1965.\n\nClifford Everett \"Bud\" Shank Jr. was born in Dayton, Ohio, United States. He began with clarinet in Vandalia, Ohio, but had switched to saxophone before attending the University of North Carolina. While at UNC, Shank was initiated into the Pi Kappa Alpha fraternity. In 1946, he worked with Charlie Barnet before moving on to Kenton and the West coast jazz scene.\n\nHe also had a strong interest in what might now be termed world music, playing Brazilian-influenced jazz with Laurindo Almeida in 1953 and 1954. Shank also joined the Lighthouse All-Stars in August 1953 and stayed with them until early January 1956. In 1958, he is the first American jazz musician to record in Italy, with an Italian jazz orchestra conducted by Ezio Leoni (aka Len Mercer).\n\nHis world music collaborations continued in 1962, fusing jazz with Indian traditions in collaboration with Indian composer and sitar player Ravi Shankar. Shank ensconced himself in the L.A. studios during the '60s, emerging occasionally to record jazz and bossa nova albums with the likes of Chet Baker and Sergio Mendes. Shank's 1966 album with Baker, Michelle, was something of a popular success, reaching number 56 on the charts. Film scores on which Shank can be heard include The Thomas Crown Affair and The Barefoot Adventure.\n\nIn 1974, Shank joined with Ray Brown, Shelly Manne (replaced by Jeff Hamilton after 1977), and Laurindo Almeida to form the group the L.A. Four, who recorded and toured extensively through 1982. Shank helped to popularize both Latin-flavored and chamber jazz music, and as a musician's musician also performed with orchestras as diverse as the Royal Philharmonic, the New American Orchestra, the Gerald Wilson Big Band, Stan Kenton's Neophonic Orchestra, and Duke Ellington. Shank had been one of the earliest jazz flutists, but in the mid-'80s he dropped the instrument in order to concentrate on alto full-time.\n\nDuring the last two decades of the 20th century, he recorded small-group albums at a modestly steady pace for the Contemporary, Concord, and Candid labels. Shank's 1997 Milestone album, By Request: Bud Shank Meets the Rhythm Section, presented the altoist in top form, burning down the house with a band of relative youngsters who included neo-bopper pianist Cyrus Chestnut. Three years later, Silver Storm was released.\n\nShank continued performing and recording after the turn of the millennium, undertaking the challenging task of forming the Los Angeles-based Bud Shank Big Band in 2005 and making his recording debut as a big-band leader with Taking the Long Way Home, released the following year by the Jazzed Media label. In 2007 Jazzed Media issued Beyond the Red Door, a duet recording by Shank and pianist Bill Mays. A documentary film about Bud Shank, Bud Shank \"Against the Tide\" Portrait of a Jazz Legend, was produced and directed by Graham Carter of Jazzed Media and released by Jazzed Media as a DVD (with a companion CD) in 2008. The film has been awarded four indie film awards including an Aurora Awards Gold.\n\nHis last gig in the Los Angeles area was at the Jazz Bakery in January 2009. Shank's passion for jazz remained strong to the very last days of his life; he died at his home in Tucson, AZ on April 2, 2009 of a pulmonary embolism shortly after returning from a recording session in San Diego. Shank's doctors had reportedly warned the saxophonist -- who had moved to Tucson for health reasons -- that playing the session could be life-threatening. Bud Shank was 82 years old.\n\n(Edited from Wikipedia & AllMusic)"
