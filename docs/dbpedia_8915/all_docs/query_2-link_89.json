Â\n\nFor over a decade Goudie is ubiquitous in Paris, becoming one of the most celebrated black American musicians in France:\n\nZellis Royal Box, c. 1927-30:Â By 1927 Goudie is playing sax at the top nightclub in Paris.\n\nBricktopâs Cabaret, 1928-30:Â Heâs heard in the band at the premier jazz/social club of the Montmartre district.\n\nJohnson-Briggs Orchestra, c. 1932-34:Â Goudie plays tenor and records his first solo with this Harlem-style swing band, the best to record there in the early â30s.Â Itâs jointly run by trumpet player Arthur Briggs, and pianist Freddie Johnson, both heard at Bricktopâs.\n\nFoxey and Grapesy.mp3Â Freddy Johnson-Arthur Briggs Orch, 1933\n\nHot Club societies of France, 1934-38:Â Goudie is utilized for concerts organized by the nascent club.Â Later âBig Boyâ is a marquee name for concerts introducing Django to Parisians.\n\nMulti-instrumental records, 1935:Â On the first records issued under his own name, Goudie doubles on on trumpet, clarinet and/or sax, accompanied by Django and Grappelli.\n\nSt. Louis Blues.mp3 (Goudie trumpet and clarinet)\n\nI Found a New Baby.mp3 (Goudie trumpet, clarinet and sax)\n\nWillie Lewis and his Entertainers, 1936-37:Â Goudie is tenor sax soloist for the top swing orchestra in France.Â Staffed by black-American musicians, it broadcasts from Chez Florence and performs at the swankest digs on the continent.\n\nSwingin' for a Swiss Miss.mp3\n\nChristopher Columbus.mp3\n\nBill Coleman Orchestra, 1937:Â Goudie plays tenor on Colemanâs outstanding small band swing records with Django, among the finest waxed by Americans in Europe between the wars.\n\nBig Boy Blues.mp3\n\nSwing Guitars.mp3\n\nDisque Swing, 1939:Â Goudie records for the Swing label under his own name playing tenor sax, and on trumpet with Andre Ekyan.\n\nYou and I, Babe.mp3\n\nYou in My Arms and Sweet Music.mp3\n\nDarktown Strutters Ball.mp3 (Goudie, trumpet)\n\nOscar Aleman, 1938-39:Â Frank teams up with the phenomenal Argentine guitarist at Le Chantilly in Paris;

Scott Fitzgerald, the Prince of Wales, Noel Coward, singer Sophie Tucker, Ernest Hemingway and John Steinbeck, artist Man Ray, Charlie Chaplin, and poet Langston Hughes who worked there.Â\n\nBig Boy Goudie was spotted playing tenor in the Freddy Johnson band at one of Bricktopâs clubs in 1929.Â Besides Freddy, house pianists included Garland Wilson and Herman Chittison.Â Fats Waller stopped by on his 1932 visit; Louis Armstrong was once heard singing a duet there with Django Reinhardt.Â She was the first to present Django and Stephane Grappelli as a headline act in Paris.\n\nHer most famous quote: \"I'm not a singer. I'm not a dancer. I'm a performer and a saloon-keeper.\"\n\nAutobiography, Bricktop by Bricktop, published in 1999.\n\nRiverwalk tribute to Bricktop\n\nÂ Â\n\n<B><BR>Alberta Hunter</B> was part of the crowd at Bricktopâs.Â She and Bricktop were at various times competitors, colleagues and, possibly, lovers.\n\nHunter was a versatile singer of blues, early black theater and cabaret.Â She was in Paris and London often between 1927-29.Â She lived, traveled or performed abroad, 1933-39 in Paris, Greece, Italy, Egypt and Turkey.\n\nÂ Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Bricktop, left Alberta, right\n\nCole Porter wrote the ironic âMiss Otis Regrets (She’s Unable to Lunch Today)â for Bricktop and her cabaret style, but she never recorded it.Â Nor do we have recordings of Bricktop in her prime.Â However, Hunterâs 1934 âMiss Otisâ probably borrows some of the flavor of Bricktopâs.\n\nUnlike this recording the cabaret operator would have been accompanied by one or few instruments, if at all, singing while wandering between tables, interacting with her staff and clientele or conducting other business.\n\nZelli's was the wildest party in town and jazz central when Goudie played there 1927-30, as seen here.\n\nZelliâs Royal Box was the highest profile venue for jazz performance during the era in Montmartre, and had an exclusive permit to serve alcohol (champagne, of course) all night.Â It was directed by entrepreneur Joe Zelli who ran several venues, including an upstairs after hours club for musicians.Â Goudie played tenor sax and clarinet in the house band at Zelliâs during 1927-30.Â\n\nThe band at Zelliâs was led by J. Glover Compton, a remarkable fellow who cut a pretty wide swath.Â Compton was a ragtime and jazz piano player in the Willie-the-Lion mold, who had a storied career before Paris.Â He was wounded in a celebrated street shooting for which Sidney Bechet no less spent nearly a year in prison during 1928-29, before being ejected from France.\n\nÂ\n\nrue Pigale in Montmartre\n\nDaytime, nightime\n\n(photographs by Emile Savitry)\n\nBig Boy and Hawk\n\nColeman Hawkins was a towering influence on European jazz when he lived there c. 1934-39; few continental tenor saxophone players didnât imitate him.Â He was Goudie's biggest influence, his tenor style was indelibly stamped with Hawkins' approach to rhythm and phrasing.Â And he was deeply impressed by his powers of improvisation.Â In those days Hawkins was famed for his variations on pop tunes lasting up to 90 minutes.\n\nL to R standing: Willie Lewis, Bill Coleman, Billy Burns,\n\nColeman Hawkins, Billy Butler, Ted Fields\n\nKneeling: Goudie\n\n(Knokke-le-Zoute, Belgium, August 1938)\n\nÂ Â\n\nColeman Hawkins in Belgium\n\nMultiple takes are included to show his process of improvisation and invention.\n\nColeman Hawkins Trio, 1938\n\nFreddy Johnson, piano; Maurice van Cleef, drums\n\n\"Dear Old Southland\"\n\n\"I Know That You Know\"\n\n\"Way Down Yonder in New Orleans\"\n\n\"Way Down Yonder in New Orleans\" (Take 2)\n\n\"When Buddah Smiles\"\n\n\"When Buddah Smiles\" (Take 2)\n\nÂ Â\n\nFrank Goudie story and chronology\n\nAmerican jazz musicians in Europe\n\nFrank Goudieâs friends and colleagues in Europe were the cream of black American jazz talent there, c. 1925-55.Â He seems to have been in steady demand among the black-American impresario bandleaders there, Noble Sissle, Benny Peyton, Sam Wooding, Willie Lewis, Arthur Briggs and Freddy Johnson.\n\nAnd he was comfortable with the top European players, best known of whom was Django Reinhardt.Â Theyâre together on several recordings.Â Goudie and Djangoâs intimate late night sessions are documented legend. Â\n\nWhat follows is a partial roster of Goudie's African-American collaborators during his nearly three decades in Europe.\n\nÂ Â\n\nGoudie with the Noble Sissle Orchestra,\n\nfrom a music short,\n\nLondon, December 1930\n\nFrank is second from right behind the pianist\n\n<B>Noble Sissle</B>\n\nIndiana, 1889 - Florida, 1975\n\nSissle had a significant role producing early black musical theater in London and Europe.Â He partnered with Eubie Blake producing Shuffle Along (1921) and was an important catalyst nurturing and introducing such stellar talent to Europe as Sidney Bechet, Tommy Ladnier, Arthur Briggs and Johnny Dunn.Â Sissle returned to the United States after 1930.\n\nIn 1930 Goudie performed with Sissle at the chic Ciro's nightclub in Paris and was on portions of the 1930 London tour.Â Â\n\nÂ Â Â\n\nA cross section of American Jazz talent in Paris, 1930\n\nMusicians assembled to greet American Gold Star Families (mothers of fallen soldiers).Â Many seen here including Goudie were working for Noble Sissle, seen crouching front left, at <I>Les Ambassadeurs</I>.Â The prestigious club, just off the Champs-Elysee, catered to a clientele of statesmen, diplomats & prime ministers, kings of commerce & multimillionaires.\n\nÂ\n\nThis is the Paris equivalent of <I>A Great Day in Harlem.</I>\n\nL to R: Rudy Jackson, alto; Albert Tines, alto; George Warren or Ramon Usera tenor; Horace Eubanks, clarinet; Big Boy Goudie, alto; Jack Carter (with cigarette), drums; Bennie Peyton, drums; Warren Harrison, guitar; Oliver Tines, drums; Edward Cole, tuba; Glover Compton (beneath tuba) piano; Billy Burns, trombone; Gene Bullard, drums; Tommy Ladnier, Snow Fisher, Arthur Briggs, Crickett Smith, trumpets.\n\n(Photo: <I>Traveling Blues</I>, Lindstrom & Vernhettes)\n\nNewly discovered film footage of Frank Goudie from the event seen above.\n\nGoudie is the tallest African American seen in this rare film clip c. 1930, generally to the left of the frame, from :45-:55, 1:18-1:33, 2:03-2:06 [hands only], 3:33-3:56.\n\nOstensibly a reception for mothers of fallen black World War I soldiers, the event proved to be the \"Great Day in Harlem\" of Paris.\n\nNegro Mothers Drive In Paris (1920-1929)\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UoY7ucCcOeU&feature=youtu.be\n\nÂ Â\n\nTrumpet player and band leader\n\nArthur Briggs\n\nArthur Briggs\n\nSouth Carolina, 1899 - Paris, 1991\n\nTrumpet player Briggs was a graduate of the famed Jenkins Orphanage Band.Â He visited, toured, or lived in Europe almost continuously from about 1920 working in Brussels, Belgium, Vienna and Germany during 1926-28.Â Briggs was with Noble Sissle in 1928, â29, â30, and a sideman for Louis Armstrongâs European tours.Â\n\nBriggs led or co-led his own bands mostly in Paris during the early thirties.Â He recorded with Coleman Hawkins and had a 1937 residency in Egypt.

Louis Armstrong in 1929-30.Â After touring Europe with Adelaide Hall in 1931 he stayed as a solo act.\n\nHe resided first in Czechoslovakia, then Hungary, and France where he remained until 1939.Â

mention of Josephine Baker who was ubiquitous in Paris from the mid-20s on, becoming a French citizen in 1937.Â\n\nThe Divas of Montmartre: Valaida Snow & Josephine Baker.mp3Â (5:45)\n\nHer performance in the 1925 <I>Revue Negre</I> astounded jaded Parisians.Â Appearing in the <I>Folies-Bergere</I> semi nude, in skimpy outfits or miming sex, Baker instantly became the rave of Paris, Brussels and Berlin.Â No less than Bricktop introduced her to Paris society.Â But she soon distanced herself from Harlem-in-Paris, took a âCountâ for a lover and launched Chez Josephine, a chic late night club of her own in Montmartre.Â Operated in the intimate Bricktop cabaret style, it charged the highest prices in Paris to an exclusive coterie.\n\nâLa Bakerâ became a popular sensation: a cult almost without equal in France.Â Women imitated her hairstyle, some darkened their skin using walnut oil.Â âBakairâ dolls, perfumes and pomades were fashionable.Â Excitement over Josephine launched âLe Tumulte Noir:â the Parisian mania for black American entertainment and interest in all things African American.Â Her vast success had little to do with her singing, which was neither jazz nor blues but a mÃ©lange ofÂ cabaret, music hall theatrical and popular song.\n\nDuring the next half century her remarkable achievements included being the first African-American female to star in a major motion picture (Zouzou, 1934), assisting the French Resistance for which she was decorated, and becoming a fierce civil rights pioneer and international figure of stature.\n\nNo American was more beloved by the French nation than Josephine Baker.\n\nLINKS:\n\nThe Lavish and elegant offical Josephine Baker website\n\nJosephine Baker at Wikipedia\n\nJosephine

through glittering spectacles mounted in the most fashionable theaters of Paris.Â One Paris observerâs memoir describes her dazzling 1930 extravaganza:\n\nÂ Â Â Â Â \" . . . excellent imported British dancing choruses of both sexes, a complete Russian ballet, trained pigeons, a live cheetah, roller-skaters, the prettiest Venetian set of the century, a marvelous first-act finale, acres of fine costumes, the four best cancan dancers in captivity . . . and an aerial ballet of heavy Italian ladies caroming about on wires.Â The show even contains long glimpses of the beautiful Baker . . . .Â\n\nÂ Â Â Â Â Â She has, alas, almost become a little lady.Â Her caramel-colored body, which overnight became a legend in Europe, is still magnificent, but it has become thinned, trained, almost civilized.Â There is a rumor that she wants to sing refined ballads . . . .Â On that lovely animal visage lies now a sad look, not of captivity, but of dawning intelligence.\"\n\nParis Was Yesterday,

him, Bob Mielke said that Goudie was a remarkable physical specimen: massive and solid, strong and fit.Â He told me Frank instructed him in some of the physical training learned in his career as a professional boxer.Â\n\n<I>Bob Mielke says Goudie was a prizefighter.mp3</I>\n\nIt has not yet been possible to corroborate Goudie's boxing career, but Iâve got a theory:\n\nGymnasiums were an established tradition in the African-American community of Montmartre in the 20s and 30s.Â Professional boxer Eugene Bullard was one of the first notable African-Americans living in Paris before WW I, and was at the center of black American jazz and ex-pat communities.\n\n(His story is remarkable including the fact that, through an odd arrangement with France, he was a black American air ace flying in WW I known as the âBlack Swallow of Death.â)\n\nBullard was original manager of the Le Grand Duc, played drums (sort of) and booked the music at Zelliâs when Goudie worked there, 1927-30.Â As the Depression hit hardest in the early 30s Bullard had to sell his clubs.Â But he retained ownership of an American-style bar and Bullards Athletic Club.Â\n\nThe club catered to VIPs including Satchmo, the Chinese ambassador to France and Fats Waller (really?), offering massage, whirlpool bathing and boxing lessons.Â Gyms were an antidote, says Bullard biographer Craig Lloyd, to \"balance their champagne-soaked bacchanalia with exercise.\"\n\nBullard ALSO promoted fights and trained professionals: the 1934 bantam-weight world champion, \"Panama\" Al Brown and his challenger.Â Brown became yet another black American Parisian celebrity, \"as much at ease with admirers like Jean Cocteau as with the half-boxer, half-musician world of Montmartre.\" Â Â\n\nÂ Â Â Â Â Â Eugene Bullard, Black Ex-patriot in Jazz-Age Paris\n\nÂ Â Â Â Â Â Craig Lloyd, Univ. of Georgia Press, 2000\n\nIâm speculating that IF Goudie ever boxed professionally it may well have been in similar circumstances.Â So the question remains: Was Frank âBig Boyâ Goudie ever a prizefighter?\n\nBill Coleman\n\nParis, Kentucky, 1904 - Toulose, France, 1981\n\nA fine jazz trumpet player Bill Coleman made notable recordings in the 1930s and 40s with Fats Waller, Benny Carter, Teddy Wilson, Mary Lou Williams, Billie Holiday, Coleman Hawkins and Django Reinhardt.\n\nIn Europe, Goudie and Coleman had several significant associations. They recorded together in the â30s and Goudie played in Bill Coleman's bands in 1949-51.\n\nColeman first came to Europe with Lucky Millinder in 1933.Â He had a stellar and celebrated career mostly in Paris, living in France permanently after 1948.\n\nSWING GUITARS -- Bill Coleman and his Orchestra, 1937.mp3\n\nBABY WON’T YOU PLEASE COME HOME -- Bill Coleman and Orchestra, 1937.mp3\n\nÂ Â Â Â Â\n\nJack (Jacques) Butler\n\nb. 1909\n\nThough he studied dentistry where he grew up in Washington D.C., Butler became a jazz trumpeter.Â After work with Cliff Jackson and Willie Bryant he went to Europe about 1935 where he played mostly in the band of Willie Lewis 1936-39.Â Butler was in Norway on a Scandinavian tour when WW II started in mid-1939; it took him nearly a year to get home to the USA.Â\n\nÂ Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â The Jack Butler Band in the late 1930s.\n\nÂ Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â (Photo: Noel Chaboust)\n\nIn the 40s he worked with Mezz Mezzrow, Art Hodes and others but returned to France in 1950.Â He led his own band on tours, played a famed Paris residency at La Cigale 1953-68, and appeared the 1961 film, Paris Blues.\n\nButler sounds terrific on Goudie's 1939 Swing session and the Willie Lewis records.
