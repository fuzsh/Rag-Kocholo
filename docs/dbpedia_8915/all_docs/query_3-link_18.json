        "text": "(Cornet, trumpet, 1900–39)\n\nA stylistic descendant of King Oliver, Ladnier learned under Bunk Johnson and played in various bands around New Orleans. Around 1917 he moved to Chicago, where he became part of the hot jazz scene and worked with Jimmie Noone and King Oliver. In 1925 he toured Europe with Sam Wooding’s band and the following year joined Fletcher Henderson in New York. In 1932, Ladnier formed the New Orleans Feetwarmers with Sidney Bechet before dropping off the scene, re-emerging in 1938 with Mezz Mezzrow until his premature death from a heart attack.\n\nStyles & Forms | Twenties | Jazz & Blues\n\nPersonalities | Eddie Lang | Twenties | Jazz & Blues\n\nAUTHORITATIVE\n\nAn extensive music information resource, bringing together the talents and expertise of a wide range of editors and musicologists, including Stanley Sadie, Charles Wilson, Paul Du Noyer, Tony Byworth, Bob Allen, Howard Mandel, Cliff Douse, William Schafer, John Wilson...\n\nCURATED\n\nClassical, Rock, Blues, Jazz, Country and more.
