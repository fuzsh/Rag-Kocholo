Father was a barber who had white customers and friends; brother was a dentist. Cheatham began playing trumpet at 12; later cornet and soprano sax. There were no teachers, instructional tools or radio, so Doc learned by ear. Joined a local church band (Bright Future Stars Club) and played cornet; organizer contacted local circus band for instruction. Johnny Dunn released a hit album; influenced Cheatham greatly. Aunt was a vocalist at Tuskegee; taught Doc breathing and throat techniques. Joined the pit band of Nashville's Bijou Theater. Did gigs at various universities: Vandebilt, Fisk, etc. Met Jerry Blake at the Bijou and, soon thereafter, Joe Smith; toured with Mary Lou Williams. First professional break came with the Sunshine Sammy revue, then John Williams (1924). Moved to Chicago; played cornet and sax, but still could not read music; worked as a dishwasher to support himself; felt he had no business among such talent. Gave away sax, sold cornet and returned to Nashville to study pharmacy. In Nashville, began playing trumpet exclusively. Learned to read music and returned to Chicago. Played with Albert Wynn, led his own band (1926), and subbed for Louis Armstrong as soloist. Collaborations with Wilbur de Paris and Chick Webb followed (1927-1928). Joined Sam Wooding in NYC and spend 3 years in Europe as lead trumpet (1927-1930); talks about Tommy Ladnier, fellow trumpet in Wooding's band. Returned to the US and played with Marion Hardy's Alabamians (1930-1932). Met Benny Carter when McKinney's Cotton Pickers needed a trumpet player; followed Carter and stayed in Detroit with the Cotton Pickers for a year. Then, replacing Reuben Reeves, joined Cab Calloway's band in NYC as lead trumpet (1933-1939). Talks about other trumpet players in Cab's band: Lammar Wright and Irving Randolph; also Ed Swayzee (trombone), Benny Payne (piano), Al Morgan (bass). Milt Hinton later succeeded Morgan; Cozy Cole became drummer. Cab's band went to Hollywood and appeared in films with Bing Crosby and Al Johnson. After Cab, joined Teddy Wilson's Big Band. Developed a spot on his lung; returned to Nashville for lengthy rest. Returned to play Sound of Jazz with Count Basie and Billie Holiday, later the International House. Joined Eddie Heywood and played Village clubs, including a number of solos (1943-1945). To overcome physical strain, began using diaphragm rather than chest; also began exercising and customizing the use of his lips. Performed with Perez Prado and other Latin-American musicians. Talks about his peers: Smith brothers, Rex Stuart, Nat Adderley, Arthur Briggs, Bill Coleman, Freddie Keppard, Armstrong, etc. Performed with Sammy Price and Herbie Mann; led own band (1960-1965) and with Benny Goodman (1966-1967). Cheatham and Owens discuss white trumpet players: the union had a law that white musicians could not go to Chicago's South Side; but they came anyway, especially to hear Jimmy Noone at the Apex Club. Discussion of Armstrong and trumpet history follow. Doc first heard Armstrong in King Oliver's band. There Armstrong did not play solo; rather, he performed under Oliver's tutelage. Armstrong is compared to Bix Beiderbecke and Earl Hines (creator of \"trumpet style\" for piano intended to accompany Armstrong) . Doc shuns such comparisons: no one has yet upset Armstrong's trumpet tradition. Concludes by claiming a lack of definitive style in his own music and discussing contemporary jazz. Talks about the circular breathing technique (Wynton Marsalis). Plays at Sweet Basil on Sundays, lectures at various universities and is awaiting the publication of first book\n\nDoc Cheatham is a trumpet player, composer, lecturer and writer. Born Adolphus Anthony Cheatham on June 13, 1905 in Nashville, Tenn. His father gave him a cornet, prompting an early career in theater bands (vaudeville and burlesque). The move to Chicago and subsequent influence of Louis Armstrong and other trumpet greats prompted him to play the trumpet seriously and exclusively\n\nThe Louis Armstrong Jazz Oral History Project was funded by the Louis Armstrong Educational Foundation, Inc\n\nInterviewer, Jimmy Owens\n\nRecorded April 1, 1993 at the Schomburg Center for Research in Black Culture\n\nPermission required to cite, quote and reproduce; contact repository for information\n\nForms part of: Louis Armstrong Jazz Oral History Project\n\nRelated Resources"
