(!)\n\n--Ethan Iverson Interviews 'Tootie' Heath: The Jazz Internet's best interviewer gets another master musician to open up. And he also writes about Paul Bley for Destination: OUT. We shouldn't have to tell you by now that both are important reading.\n\n--Ted Gioia Steps Down From Jazz.com Leadership: Gioia, the site editor and a major contributor, sent an e-mail last week to his writers and other media types, and JazzTimes has a confirmation. He has no comment about the future of the site. This is sad: in under three years of his leadership, jazz.com went from non-existent to one of my daily must-reads. Let the speculation begin ...\n\n--15 Fashion-Forward Jazz Musicians: John Murph captions some photos for The Root. Usual suspects like Banana Republicans David Sanchez and Esperanza Spalding appear, as do some more offbeat choices like Theo Bleckmann and Leo Tardin. I recently met Murph, who occasionally contributes to NPR and once worked here, at a Gretchen Parlato show (she also makes the list), and dude was dressed pretty impeccably too. I certainly would trust his sartorial eye over my clearance-rack tastes.\n\n--A New Tommy Ladnier Book: It is here, and I heard about it here. An under-recorded and under-remembered early trumpeter, this guy."
