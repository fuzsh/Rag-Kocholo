        "text": "Today is May 28.\n\nTrumpeter Tommy Ladnier was born this day in 1900 in Florenceville, La. He was a fixture on the early Chicago jazz scene before joining Fletcher Henderson's band and touring Europe with Sam Wooding. Despite a drinking problem and the tough Depression times, Ladnier stayed with his music.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn the early 1930s, he opened a tailor shop in New York with saxophonist Sidney Bechet. They soon formed a band called the New Orleans Footwarmers and recorded some classic sessions for the Victor label in 1932. Ladnier died in 1939.\n\nSaxophonist Andy Kirk was born this day in 1898 in Newport, Ky. He was a mailman and part-time musician for more than a decade before taking over leadership of the Clouds of Joy swing band in 1929. Kirk kept the Clouds together until 1948.\n\nBebop pianist Russ Freeman was born this day in 1926 in Chicago. This West Coast-based player had very important musical associations with Chet Baker, Shorty Rogers, Art Pepper and Shelly Manne.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nLooking at today's hip happenings...\n\nOn the New York jazz scene... the Lou Donaldson quartet is the Village Vanguard through Sunday.

He made it with tenor saxophonist Joe Lovano, pianist Gonzalo Rubalcaba, bassist Christian McBride and drummer Lewis Nash. They played a variety of new Martino compositions and the John Coltrane piece, \"Africa.\"\n\nPianist Eddie Palmieri has made his debut on the Concord Picante label with \"Ritmo Caliente\" by his La Perfecta II band. His band features trumpeters Brian Lynch and John Walsh, flutist Karen Joseph and vocalist Herman Olivera.\n\nSaxophonist Gilad Altzmon, an Israeli expatriate living in England, is out with his newest CD, \"Exile,\" on enja. Its U.S. release comes at the same time as the publication of his first book, \"A Guide to the Perplexed.\" The recording by an expanded version of his Orient House Ensemble is a blend of jazz, Middle Eastern melodies and political musical statements. \"Al Quds,\" an Arabic interpretation of an Israeli 1967 war anthem, has a hopeful, call-to-prayer feel.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn his twin projects, Altzmon raises questions with elusive answers. In his liner notes, he asks \"How is it that people who have suffered so much and for so long can inflict pain on the other?\"\n\nHis satirical book has been described as a darkly comic futuristic story that dares to imagine the journal of a mid-21st century archivist when the state of Israel has been dismantled and a new Jewish diaspora has begun."
