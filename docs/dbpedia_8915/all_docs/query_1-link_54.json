I will be ordering again.”\n\n“I received my first order (6 records) yesterday and was kind of nervous about their actual condition until I opened them and played them. I can honestly say I am very pleased. They all played perfectly. All of the records themselves are pretty much NM (near mint) and the record sleeves are in really good condition with the usual wear but nothing major or horrible. I received one that was still sealed, which I always think is cool to come across with older records. I will definitely be ordering again soon.”"
