        "text": "Jazz music is now a century old and any of the turbulent periods through which the art-form has passed could be accurately justified as having been a 'Golden Age'. The music's incubation in New Orleans, its travel up to Chicago, the Swing era, the Be-bop revolution, the 'Birth of the Cool' and the arrival of the abstract improvisers all occurred within the relatively brief time frame of sixty or so years, each successive style having its ardent believers and its cynical detractors. Few eras were as rich in diverse talent as the period covered in this four-disc retrospective. This was the age of classic Jazz, an era in which the originators and leading lights of the music's development co-existed side by side with some of its finest consolidators, the years in which the Jazz message travelled all over the United States from New Orleans to Chicago, to New York, Los Angeles and beyond.\n\nTrack Listing\n\nDisc One\n\nJELLY-ROLL MORTON'S RED HOT PEPPERS:\n\n1.
