        "text": "In 1931, this chapel was named as a place of Cultural Interest. It is right next to the Roman Bridge. It stands on a dolmen (5000-3000 BC). Under King Favila, it was consecrated in the year 737. The chapel was erected to house the Cross of Oak, later renamed the Victoria Cross. The current building is a reconstruction that was enacted by Luis Menéndez Pidal in the postwar period. In his CRIPA lies the dolmen in which according to legend was buried King Favila. We found under the Chapel of Santa Cruz a Neolithic dolmen burial mound which was built in 737 to protect Victoria Cross and was declared an artistic monument in 1931."
