        "text": "Having Marino González (left) as my guide to the region’s valleys and mountains and cheese producers was the equivalent of taking guitar lessons from Andres Segovia. González was born in 1956 on a remote farm in the isolated mountain village of Cirieño. “When I was born, the mountain villages of my native region were still very Medieval,” he told me. “My five siblings and I had to work like adults to survive as a family.”\n\nGonzález is a taciturn man who speaks Spanish with a Medieval Asturian village accent that requires concentration to interpret sometimes. With his low-key, but expert, commentary along the way I was led through a remarkable series of cheese-related adventures by a man who is obviously profoundly in love with his Asturian homeland.\n\nGonzález left the family farm and attended law school before deciding to dedicate himself to reviving the traditional, often nearly extinct, cheeses of Asturias, beginning with his own family’s made in his home village. He began to market the artisan cheeses of some 40 small producers for whom selling their cheeses outside the region was nearly impossible. By 2010, they were billing nearly $6 million of food products and built a large new facility near Siero, outside Oviedo, to keep the cheeses in acclimated chambers for a curing process known as afinaje.Since I first met González in the early 2000s he has taught me everything that I know about the Asturias—its cheeses and its other regional products: fabada Asturiana (the Asturian national bean dish), artisanal sidras (apple cider) and Calvados-like apple brandies.\n\nIn 2005, I made my first visit to Asturias since 1971, meeting González in the Picos de Europa mountains, then driving to the dramatic Desfiladero de Los Beyos canyon and up into the hills to visit his family home. There his sister Aurora produces an historic, nearly extinct, now highly regarded artisan cheese made from cow’s milk, a dense, compact, paisano queso with a unique flinty texture and flavor. The pieces break away like shards of white chocolate, and the chalky firmness at first bite melts into a creamy paste, which I ate with cider.\n\nOn several outings, I visited a number of cheese producers who work with González in Arenas de Cabrales, where he showed me Cabrales cheese production and how a thin length of bone is used to bore into the cheese, a sample of which is extracted and smelled to judge how the cheese is developing. We sampled González’s Cabrales, laced with a blue Roquefort-like benign mold that imparts a strong, spicy flavor.\n\nIn 2010, I visited the lively Sunday morning market in Cangas de Onís, where cheeses, sausages, beans, vegetables, cider and more are spread across several blocks and augmented by the local specialty food shops, some offering more than two dozen local cheeses. In the west near Áviles, close to the Cantabrian Sea, I sampled the cow’s milk blue La Peral and the unique piquant paprika-laced Afuega’l Pitu (“fire-in-the-throat”). I tasted three types of raw milk goat’s cheese made by Jesús Gutiérrez and his son Manuel in the tiny rural Peñamellera Baja community of Buelles along the Cares-Deva River.Back at Arenas de Cabrales, I visited González’s own artisan cheese plant, destroyed in a flood in 2012, and the dark, humid caves on the hill where hundreds of Cabrales cheeses were maturing along with Afuega’l Pitu, Peñamellera and Ovín. On six other trips ranging from 2006 until 2017 I made other forays with Marino González into Asturias and visited another dozen artisan cheese producers under his guidance. My stay at the Heredad de la Cueste in Llenín was part of another remarkable three-day Asturian adventure during the last days of October 2012. On that trip, I returned with Jaime Rodríguez to visit Rosa Maria Intriago, after she had moved part of her cheese-curing operation up to a vast, newly utilized cave supervised by the Consejo Regulador (Regulatory Council) of the Denominación de Origen. Known as Cueva Oscura (Dark Cave) and long used as a refuge by hunters, the cave is up in the puerto, a mountain pass in the Picos de Europa near the hamlet of Avín (population about 130).\n\nWhen Rodríguez and I visited the cave, we found Rosa Intriago stacking her Gamonéu cheeses on shelves for curing. There was a brochure about the new cheese-producing cave with admonitions about fotografía prohibida (photography prohibited) and signs that said it was prohibited for anyone to be in the caves who did not have an official reason to be there. But I was with Rodríguez, Intriago and other Gamonéu producers who were members of the Regulatory Council and no one seemed to care that I was taking photographs, so I took several, knowing that I would not be coming back to the Cueva Oscura again soon.\n\nThe great blue cheese Cabrales, the best-known of all Asturian cheeses (and second only to Manchego among Spanish cheeses), is usually easy to find in good cheese outlets in America. Importers and stores such as Despana Brands, La Tienda, Michelle Buster’s Forever Cheese, Artisanal Premium Cheese Center, Whole Foods, Zabar’s and many other American outlets carry these cheeses.\n\nAlong with Cabrales, the other major Asturian blue cheeses are Gamonéu, La Peral and Monje Blue. Valdeòn, the blue cheese from the Castilla y Leòn side of the Picos de Europa, is available in top cheese stores in the American and European markets. So are Los Beyos, an I.G.P. (Protected Geographical Indication) available in milk from cows, ewes and goats; La Collada, a brand of Marino González’s family cheese also available as “Tres Leches,” (mixed milk); Afuega’l Pitu (cows’ milk), and the Penamellera Alta cheese La Cueva Llonin (mixed milk).\n\nExcerpted from Sunset in a Glass: Adventures of a Food and Wine Road Warrior in Spain\n\nBy Gerry Dawes ©2021\n\n* * * * *\n\n* * * * *\n\nPoem by Archer M.
