        "text": "There are so many fun things to do in Oviedo, Spain. Here is a complete guide with plenty of suggestions to make sure you do not miss out on any of the local attractions, fascinating culture and architecture, and the delicious food and drink that this captivating city offers.\n\nFounded in the 8th century, Oviedo (pronounced oh-vee-ay-doh) was once the capital of the ancient Kingdom of Asturias. Although no longer a Kingdom, Asturias is a Spanish principality with a strong local identity, and Oviedo is still its capital today.\n\nOviedo is both an ancient and modern city, full of contrasts and surprises waiting to be discovered.\n\nFrom narrow cobblestone streets steeped in history, to mouthwatering hearty food, peculiar cider traditions, and an incredible amount of public art scattered around the city, Oviedo has something for everyone.\n\nI visited Oviedo as part of a 5-day itinerary of Northern Spain by train, so here are my top recommendations for fun things to do in Oviedo. But before that, here is a little bit of an overview on this charming medieval city.\n\nAn Overview of Oviedo\n\nWhere to stay in Oviedo, Spain\n\nGran Hotel España\n\n> Book Gran Hotel España here\n\nHere are alternative places to stay in Oviedo that are highly recommended:\n\nNH Oviedo Principado\n\nHotel Sercotel Ciudad de Oviedo\n\nSoho Boutique Oviedo\n\nFun things to do in Oviedo\n\nExplore the Old Town\n\nOviedo’s Old Town oozes charm in every corner, and you will want to wander aimlessly through its narrow streets, getting lost and discovering hidden squares and picturesque lanes. This is one of the first things to do in Oviedo.\n\nThe city has been a visionary in pedestrianising its town centre, so you can wander around and feel like time hasn’t really moved on here.\n\nThe heart of the Old Town is Plaza de Alfonso II El Casto, also known as Cathedral Square. No matter what direction you take from here, you will find some little gem.\n\nIf you enjoy escape rooms, a fun way to explore Oviedo Old Town (and beyond) is by turning the streets of the city into an interactive game with an Oviedo outdoor escape room game.\n\nVisit Oviedo Cathedral\n\nWhile you are in Cathedral Square, make sure you visit Oviedo Cathedral. It is an important symbol of Spanish Gothic architecture that took almost 300 years to be built.\n\nOviedo Cathedral is the starting point of one of the routes of the Camino de Santiago. You may know that Spain has many Caminos, with the most popular one being the Camino Francés (French Way), which goes through cities like Burgos and León.\n\nThe Camino that starts in Oviedo is the Camino Primitivo (Primitive Way). When you visit the Cathedral entrance, you will notice that one of the arches on the portico was built at an angle. This was to point pilgrims in the right direction to Santiago.\n\nInside, don’t miss the Chapel of King Casto, where there is a Royal Pantheon containing the bodies of the monarchs of the Kingdom of Asturias. The Holy Chamber is a UNESCO World Heritage Site.\n\nYou can climb up to the top of the tower for 360 degree views of the city.\n\nVenture into the Archaeological Museum of Asturias\n\nThe Archaeological Museum of Asturias is located within the former Benedictine Monastery of San Vicente, which was built in the 16th century.\n\nThe monastery is believed to have originally been founded in the 8th century, and it’s said to be the birthplace of Oviedo.\n\nThe museum displays a great prehistoric collection of the Asturian Neolithic, Megalithic, Bronze, and Iron Ages. Entry is free, and it’s worth popping in even if it’s just to see the original 16th century cloister.\n\nGo hunting for sculptures\n\nAs you wander around Oviedo you will notice an abundance of statues. There are over 170 scattered all over the city! Every other street, crossroad, and square has a statue offering a tribute to elements of Asturian culture, and to the art of sculpture itself.\n\nA couple that stood out for me were ‘La Lechera’ (The Milkmaid) in Trascorrales Square, which celebrates the milkmaids that used to distribute milk across the city with their donkeys. This practice continued until the 1970s.\n\nI also want to mention the statue of ‘La Regenta’ (The Regent’s Wife), which can be found in Cathedral Square. She is the fictional character of a 19th century Spanish novel. It is a classic that most Spaniards have read at school.\n\nI also loved Culis Monumentalibus, a giant bronze bum by Eduardo Ùrculo that has become the unofficial symbol of the city.\n\nOf all the things to do in Oviedo, going hunting for statues is a must.\n\nListen to the sound of bagpipes\n\nIf you are in Oviedo on a Saturday or Sunday, there is a good chance that you will come across one of the local bandas de gaitas (bagpipe bands) while you are in the vicinity of Cathedral Square.\n\nYou may be surprised to see and hear bagpipes, but this wind instrument, often exclusively associated with Scotland, is an important part of music in Celtic cultures such as Asturias, Galicia, and Brittany.\n\nRELATED READING\n\nThings To Do In A Coruña, Spain – The Perfect One Day Itinerary\n\nDiscover Oviedo’s UNESCO Pre-Romanesque churches\n\nAsturian Pre-Romanesque architecture is a style typical of the region. It first appears in the 8th century at the beginning of the Kingdom of Asturias. It is closely linked to the first Christian kingdom of the Iberian Peninsula after the Islamic conquest.\n\nToday, there are 6 sites that make up the UNESCO World Heritage Site “Monuments of Oviedo and the Kingdom of the Asturias”. Two of those sites are very close to Oviedo and you can visit them by taking a 20-minute bus.\n\nSanta María del Naranco is the most significant Pre-Romanesque building of the group. It was originally built as a palace for Asturian King Ramiro I and later converted into a church.\n\nIt is built on a hilltop, so the views of the city from here are pretty spectacular, which makes this one of the best things to do in Oviedo.\n\nA short walk up the hill is San Miguel de Lillo, a small church dedicated to St Michael the Archangel. Today only a third of the building is original, as the church collapsed and had to be rebuilt in the Middle Ages.\n\nRELATED READING\n\nThe Perfect Itinerary For One Day In Bilbao, Spain\n\nEl Fontán Market\n\nNamed after a spring that used to occupy the spot where the market was built, El Fontán Market is the place to see every day Oviedo alive.\n\nAlthough there’s been a market here since the 16th century, the current building dates from 1885. If you are a film buff, you may recognise it as one of the locations in the film Vicky Cristina Barcelona.\n\nStep inside and you will find a food lover’s paradise. From fresh fish directly caught in the Bay of Biscay, to local specialties like homemade chorizo and Asturian Beef, and fresh bread and pastries.\n\nAsturias is Spain’s largest and one of Europe’s most important cheese producing regions, so make sure you sample some Asturian cheeses while you are in the market. This is one of the top things to do in Oviedo (unless you are vegan, of course).\n\nTry the local cuisine of Asturias\n\nAnother element that is deep rooted in the Asturian culture is the local cuisine. Known for its seafood and its hearty mountain stews, there are a few dishes that every visitor to Oviedo (or Asturias) should try.\n\nThe most famous local dish is fabada, a rich bean and meat stew that will leave you feeling like you’ve just had the warmest of hugs. It is the epitome of comfort food.\n\nAnother traditional Asturian dish is cachopo, the Asturian version of cordon bleu. And for dessert, arroz con leche (local rice pudding) is as Asturian as it gets.\n\nA highly recommended place to try any of these dishes is La Corte de Pelayo Restaurant. Their fabada has been a finalist multiple times in the fabada competition, and their cachopo has won the best cachopo award with a recipe from 1947.\n\nRELATED READING\n\nA Taste of Granada – The Granada Food Tour That Goes Beyond Tapas\n\nSample local sweet treats\n\nOne of the famous sweets in Oviedo that everyone must try is moscovitas. They are delicate biscuits made with marcona almond biscuits and covered with chocolate on one side. The chocolate can be dark, milk or white.\n\nThe best place to try moscovitas is in Confitería Rialto, where the original recipe was developed.\n\nAnother traditional sweet is the carbayones, perhaps the most typical sweet in Oviedo. Carbayones are pastries filled with a creamy almond dough that date back to the beginning of the 20th century.\n\nTry them at Camilo de Blas, a traditional sweet and patisserie shop that has been making carbayones since 1914.\n\nAsturias, land of cheeses\n\nFor me, the highlight of the food I tried while in Oviedo was the cheeses.\n\nAsturias is often referred to as the land of cheeses. With over 40 types, it is Spain’s largest cheese producer, and one of the most important in Europe. The variety and quality is astounding!\n\nDon’t leave without trying a local cheese board. Sidrería Tierra Astur El Vasco has more than 40 varieties of cheese on offer, so the biggest problem you’ll have will be choosing which ones to try.\n\nIf you like strong and slightly spicy cheeses, try Casín. For blue cheese lovers, I recommend trying the world-famous Cabrales. And for those who prefer mild cheeses, Afuega’l Pitu is a fantastic choice!\n\nImmerse yourself in cider tradition\n\nWhen it comes to drinks, cider is king in Asturias. In fact, you cannot visit this Northern Spanish region and not go to a sidrería (cider house), where cider is served by an escanciador (cider pourer). It’s one of the most popular things to do in Oviedo.\n\nCider in Asturias is not fizzy, so the act of escanciar involves pouring it from a height to create bubbles that help enhance the flavour of the cider. Each pour is about two fingers’ worth of drink. More than that and the carbonisation is lost by the time you drink it.\n\nOviedo nightlife\n\nIf you are wondering what to do in Oviedo at night, head to Mon Street, the heart of Oviedo nightlife. With plenty of bars and pubs to choose from, you are guaranteed a good night out. But this is Spain, so make sure you don’t turn up before 11pm!\n\nHow to get to Oviedo\n\nThe easiest and quickest way to get to Oviedo is by flying into Asturias airport. Vueling is the only international airline that flies directly from London, but you can fly from all over the world via Madrid.\n\n> Check the best deals on flights on Skyscanner here\n\nFrom Asturias airport, you can get a bus to Oviedo or book a transfer.\n\nIf you would like to avoid flying, you could take a ferry from Plymouth to Santander. Then take the train from Santander to Oviedo.\n\n> Check the best deals on train fares on Omio here\n\nDo you have any questions about things to do in Oviedo?Let me know in the comments!\n\nLIKE THIS POST?
