        "text": "Pelayo (died c. 737) was the founder of the Christian kingdom of Asturias in northern Spain, which survived through the period of Moorish hegemony to become the spearhead of the Christian Reconquista in the later Middle Ages.\n\nPelayo’s historical personality is overshadowed by his legend. As far as can be ascertained, he was a page, or possibly a member of the royal bodyguard, of the Visigothic king Roderick, and he may have been of royal blood. He survived the defeat (711) of the Visigoths by the Moors at the Battle of Guadalete near Medina Sidonia and reached his native Asturias, where he led a revolt of Asturians and Visigothic refugees against the Moorish governor Munuza. He was captured and sent to Córdoba as a hostage but escaped (717) and again assumed leadership of the Asturian rebellion. The rebels, though driven into the uplands of the Picos de Europa, were able to survive massive attacks by Moorish armies, especially at the Battle of Monte Auseba, and, eventually, Pelayo—accepted as their ruler (c. 718–c. 737)—was able to set up a tiny kingdom with its capital at Cangas de Onís. The stories and relics of Pelayo associated with the nearby shrine of Covadonga, the preserved site of the first major victory against the Moors (722), belong to legend rather than to fact; it was, however, in this legendary guise that he became an important symbol of Christian resistance in medieval Spanish history and literature."
