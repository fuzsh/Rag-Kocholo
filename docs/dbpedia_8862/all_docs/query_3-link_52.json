        "text": "1 Gijón\n\nGijón is Asturias’ largest city with 272,000 inhabitants. From the main road into the city, you’ll be greeted by a gigantic tower belonging to the church of the city’s huge university complex, which serves as a signpost.\n\nUniversidad Laboral de Gijón, built in 1955 and today a Gijón landmark. At 270,000 square meters, the complex is the largest building in Spain. The complex, which consists of main buildings, church, theater and courtyard, was originally built as a center for orphans. Today it serves as a university and tourist office.\n\nOne of Gijón’s main attractions is the crescent-shaped San Lorenzo beach, located in the middle of the city with stunning views of the Atlantic Ocean. Stroll along the 3-kilometer long promenade with the locals, soak up the sun on the fine sand or jump in the waves.\n\nAt the end of the promenade is the old town of Cimadevilla, with the church of San Pedro at the end.\n\nThe charming neighborhood with winding streets, colorful houses and the Plaza Mayor as its center, also has a green park (Cerro de Santa Catalina) with beautiful sea views and a small harbor.\n\nOn the harbor is a modern sculpture, Árbol de la Sidra (Cider Tree), made from green cider bottles. It is a powerful symbol of the 45 million liters of cider produced in Asturias per year from locally grown apples. In the Old Town, you can sample cider and local dishes in the many cider houses (restaurants serving cider).\n\nGijón is also home to the region’s folk museum, Muséu del Pueblu d’Asturias, which provides insight into Asturian culture.\n\nCross the multi-colored bridge and you’ll reach Avilés old town with charming squares and pedestrian streets with plenty of shopping opportunities. The pedestrian streets of Avilés are characterized by the many archways that hide shops and restaurants.\n\nA good place to stop for a coffee is in Plaza de España, a pleasant square with the city hall and a few palaces.\n\nYou can also grab a to-go coffee in the romantic Park Ferrera, whose balustrade is the backdrop for a scene in Woody Allen’s movie Vicky Cristina Barcelona. The park is English-style and 81,000 square meters in size. It is located in the city center and was formerly the garden for the Ferrera awnings.\n\n3 Cudillero\n\nThe small, amphitheater-shaped fishing village of Cudillero, whose pastel-colored houses cascade down the cliffs towards the sea, is often compared to the towns on the Amalfi Coast.\n\nThe postcard-like gem is said to have been founded by the Vikings. Many Spaniards come here to enjoy a catch-of-the-day lunch at one of the many seafood restaurants located around the Plaza de Marina at the bottom of town. I also recommend eating in the city for lunch, when most restaurants are open.\n\nClimb the narrow, steep streets with lots of stairs to reach one of the city’s many viewpoints, Mirador San Juan, at the top of the city. It’s worth the effort.\n\nAlong the way, you may meet some of the locals who would love to have a chat. We met an elderly lady who told us that she hadn’t been out of her home for the last five years because Cudillero is difficult to access with its steep streets. She gets groceries delivered to her door.\n\n4 Llanes\n\nLlanes is beautifully situated around a small harbor. Along the pier at the small harbor you’ll find the artwork “Los Cubos de la Memoria” (Memory Cubes), painted on concrete blocks that form the breakwater of the harbor. Created by artist Ibarrola, it illustrates the cultural history of Llanes. In the city center you’ll find cultural heritage in the form of 300 meters of well-preserved 13th century city walls, a castle tower and the Basilica of Santa Maria del Concejo.\n\nFishing is important in Llanes, and the harbor area is dotted with restaurants where you can taste the catch of the day. Gigantic colonial-style mansions from the 19. and The 20th century is sprinkled throughout Llanes. The mansions are called “casas de los indianos” (Indian houses) and were built by locals who had become rich after immigrating to Cuba and Costa Rica. Back home, they built the mansions as a symbol of their success. Casino de Llanes in the city center is a fine example.\n\n5 Lastres\n\nLastres belongs to the club of towns that have been called Spain’s most beautiful. The small fishing village is built on a hillside, where the white houses (with a few colored ones in between) hang like nests on the mountainside. The town has a small fishing and sports harbor. The fishing harbor is home to 50 fishing boats that catch around 400 tons of fish per year, and the harbor views can be enjoyed from most of the city.\n\nBuilt between the 16th and 18th centuries, the old city center has an interesting combination of mansions, fishermen’s houses and charming squares.\n\nWorth seeing is the 18th-century church of Santa María de Sábada in classic Baroque style, whose tower serves as both a watchtower and bell tower.\n\nThe town’s small beach is ideal for a siesta in the sand or a dip in the sea. Also visit the San Roque viewpoint for breathtaking views of the coast and harbor.\n\nEat well\n\nSeafood naturally plays a starring role in the gastronomy of the Asturian coastal towns, and you’ll have plenty of opportunities to find a good restaurant where you can taste the delights fresh from the sea. Here are a few of my recommendations, but feel free to try them out. There are so many great places to eat along the coast.\n\nYume Gastro in the tower of Centro Niemeyer in Aviles is a small restaurant with a focus on modern, creative gastronomy. Run by a young couple, Yume offers a couple of sophisticated, high-quality menus that you can enjoy with a view of the Niemeyer complex. Book a table in advance.\n\nSidreria el Puerto in Llanes serves freshly caught seafood in a cozy setting right next to the fishing boats. The dishes are simple, classic and you can also taste the region’s famous cider."
