        "text": "The Princess of Asturias Foundation has put together a broad-ranging cultural programme that includes the participation of the Princess of Asturias Laureates in various activities during the days leading up to the Awards Ceremony, which will be held on 20th October in the Campoamor Theatre, Oviedo.\n\nThe programme, called “Awards Week”, includes around thirty cultural activities to be held in AvilÃ©s, Cangas de OnÃ­s, Cudillero, GijÃ³n, Mieres, NoreÃ±a and Oviedo starting Saturday, 14th October. The events featuring the Laureates will include talks, round tables, visits, exhibitions and a treasure hunt. These cultural events will also count on the participation of professionals, academics and prominent figures from different fields and disciplines.\n\nSince 1996, the Foundation has scheduled different activities in diverse locations in Asturias aimed at making the Laureates and their contributions to the world of science, culture or any other field in which they work more accessible to society at large. The Laureates will combine the activities with diverse meetings with the press, the schedule for which will be announced in the coming days.\n\nAn educational project entitled “Taking the Floor” has also been put together as part of Awards Week aimed at primary, secondary and pre-university pupils in the Principality of Asturias, in which more than 6,600 pupils from 132 schools have taken part. This is third edition of this project and will bring together schoolchildren around the figures of this year’s Laureates in the categories of Communication and Humanities (Les Luthiers), the Arts (William Kentridge), International Cooperation (The Hispanic Society of America) and Sports (the All Blacks).\n\nThe Principality of Asturias Regional Ministry of Education and Culture, the Principality of Asturias Regional Parliament, Oviedo, GijÃ³n, AvilÃ©s and Cangas de OnÃ­s Municipal Councils, the University of Oviedo and Port Authority of GijÃ³n have all collaborated in the organization of this series of events. The series of events are sponsored by Cepsa and TÃ©cnicas Reunidas and have also counted on the collaboration of the Cajastur-Liberbank Foundation, all members of the Princess of Asturias Foundation.\n\nAPPENDIX: Programme of activities featuring the Laureates (subject to change).
