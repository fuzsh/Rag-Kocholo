        "text": "(For the View From Your Window contest, the results below exceed the content limit for Substack’s email service, so to ensure that you see the full results, click the headline above.)\n\nA sleuth in Annapolis sends a really touching email:\n\nI’m guessing I average at least 20 hours a week looking at “content” on the internet. As often as not, your weekly VFYW reveal is more informative, entertaining, and ... dare I say “uplifting”? ... than all the rest of it put together.\n\nCase in point: thanks to last week’s Parsippany/Springsteen connection and the image of the 2023 tour dates, my wife and I will be joining my son and daughter-in-law for a concert in Seattle on Feb 27. Springsteen will probably go on forever, but I’m afraid I won’t (I'll be 75 in a few days).\n\nI have no idea where this week’s view is, but as soon as I find out, it’s going on my list of places to visit!\n\nAnother great connection through the contest is reflected in the video below. Chris Ryan — a friend of the Dish, travel buddy of mine, and fellow Substacker — is currently in the republic of Georgia with his partner Anya (also a Substacker). The two had lunch last week with the paragliding sleuth in our recent contest from Georgia. Later, Chris and Anya tried to find the notoriously named Nazi Guesthouse:\n\nOn to this week’s contest, first up is a frequent sleuth who is approaching super status (which, FYI, I determine after someone has 25 entries — including a winning entry — so if this applies to you and I missed it, please ping me):\n\nThis view is so frustrating! I don’t know how the super-sleuths do this, week after week.\n\nThere’s a car. You would think identifying the make of the black car would be a clue, but no. I can’t find the logo. I’m guessing we’re driving on the right side of the street, but it’s so narrow it might be a one-way street.\n\nThere are people on the street with some object? I can’t identify it.\n\nThe satellite dishes suggest we are either much north or much south.\n\nIt looks like we are in the mountains, but there are palm trees?\n\nI don’t know what to think. But I’ll send a guess of Villa de Merlo, Argentina, because you need a wildly off-base entry, right?\n\nBut not as off-base as the simple entry of “Harper’s Ferry, WV.” Another sleuth gets to the right continent:\n\nHmm. Slanted roofs with European-style license plates give this an alpine feels — but wait, those are palm trees, so it can’t be Switzerland, northern Italy or Austria. I’m going with Brajše, Montenegro.\n\nHere’s Chini with a spoiler — but you have to really, really squint:\n\nAnd because it’s Chini, he also got inside the window:"
