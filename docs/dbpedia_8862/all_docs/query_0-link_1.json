        "text": "Cangas de Onís: basic information on the map\n\nAt present, Cangas de Onís has become a important tourism center, thanks to its scenic beauty, its history and art, its gastronomy... above all promoting rural and active tourism in which hunting, fishing, mountaineering, adventure sports, etc. can be combined.\n\nThe main population centers are Covadonga, Villanueva, Corao, Labra, Tornín, Mestas de Con, Intriago, Zardón, Margolles and Triongo. It limits to the north with the councils of Ribadesella and Parres, to the south with the province of Leon, to the east with the councils of Llanes and Onís and to the west with Parres and Amieva.\n\nRoman bridge and Covadonga\n\nIn the council there were marked paleolithic settlements. In rock art they emphasize the caves of Buxu, los Azules and la de la Güelga. However the emblem of the city\n\nis the call Roman bridge. Its actual construction was during the High Middle Ages, probably in the s. XIII. With its famous banked arch and two other minor arches that are unequal. The bridge could well be a reconstruction of a previous one that would date back to Roman times. What is certain is that the layout of the Roman road that linked the towns of Lucus Asturum (near Oviedo) and Portus Victoriae (current Santander) was based on it.\n\nIn the 8th century it starts the reconquest of Spanish territory from this town. After the victory of Covadonga in 722, Cangas became a small court and Pelayo established the town as his capital: first of the Kingdom of Asturias and later of all the territories that he was conquering. This is why Cangas de Onís is considered the first capital of Spain.\n\nThe Monastery of San Pedro de Villanueva and a presumed primitive temple or chapel in Covadonga They are attributed to the reign of Alfonso I (Pelayo's son-in-law) with whom the Asturian kingdom was consolidated. Ancient chroniclers maintained that the cult of La Santina is older than it may seem, and that already in Pelayo's time the Virgin was highly regarded and had a decisive influence on the Christian victory. Since then, she has had a cave all to herself in the surroundings of the basilica. Carved out of the rock, it is undoubtedly one of the most beautiful spots in Covadonga (etymologically Covadonga comes from the Latin expression \"Cova dominica\" which means \"Cave of the Lady\") and a few thousand pilgrims come to it every year in search of some extra grace for their lives. The current basilica was designed following a Neo-Romanesque aesthetic, and was built between 1877 and 1901 with a beautiful limestone in a pinkish hue.\n\nPicos de Europa\n\nThe twentieth century begins with two important events for Cangas de Onís, the granting of a city title on the one hand and the creation of the Covadonga Mountain National Park (1918), on the other. The Today Picos de Europa National Park It is one of the most beautiful places on the continent, with an overwhelmingly karstic landscape, and includes gorges and gorges, immaculate rivers and valleys and large native forest masses.\n\nThe three massifs of this park: the western massif (El Cornión), the central massif (Los Urrieles), and the eastern massif (Andara), are physically delimited by the gorges of the salmon rivers Sella, Cares, Duje and Deva. The western massif, with its highest point, Peña Santa de Castilla (2.596 m.), is the largest and most varied of the three, and is particularly appropriate for hiking. The Enol and Ercina lakes are located in this massif.\n\nAscent to the Lakes and guided route\n\n55€\n\nperson\n\nWater, nature, fun and sports for everyone: children, adults and pets.

Quality products that are exposed every Sunday in one of the most famous markets in all of Asturias.\n\nFurthermore, the high density of cider houses and restaurants in the capital is the icing on the cake of this gastronomic pyramid, the culmination of his culinary passion, genuine and essentially Asturian, with dishes as famous as the following:\n\nAccommodation in Cangas de Onis\n\nPioneer in the development of rural tourism in Asturias, this municipality welcomes us with hospitality; with hotels, rural houses, apartments... very comfortable, where we can stay with all the guarantees.\n\nAdventure activities\n\nAll of Cangas is a privileged setting for activities in nature, and for this reason its capital is the seat of numerous active tourism agencies that will surprise us with their proposals for all audiences.\n\nParties\n\nCangas de Onís has a wide repertoire of festivals and fairs that are celebrated by the different towns of the council.
