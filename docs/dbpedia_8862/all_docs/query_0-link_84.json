        "text": "Church of Santa María la Real de Covadonga\n\nThere are some places in Spain that draw tourists from all over the world—Antoni Gaudí’s still-unfinished Sagrada Família church, the Moorish wonders of the Alhambra, or the Prado Museum in Madrid—but then there are sites that draw a much more local crowd, monuments like Zaragoza’s Pilar Basilica, the royal pantheons where medieval kings and queens are buried, or a monastery where the Spanish language was first written down.\n\nThe Royal Site of Covadonga, hidden deep within the mountains of the Picos de Europa National Park, belongs to the latter group of destinations. A small, underwhelming collection of monuments, Covadonga holds a special place in the Spanish national psyche for being the place where Spain was born.\n\nWhat happened here?\n\nThe strategically-located cave\n\nThe year was 722. Eleven years earlier, Muslim Berbers from North Africa had invaded the Iberian peninsula, quickly overrunning the feeble Kingdom of the Visigoths. A new Islamic emirate was established that encompassed almost all of modern-day Spain and Portugal—all except the steep mountains that line the north of the peninsula. It was here that a remnant of the old Visigothic ruling class had fled after King Roderick was killed and the government fell apart. They hid out between the lonely river valleys and rugged mountain peaks that dominate the Asturian countryside.\n\nCall them Christian noblemen, call them barbarian warlords—whoever they were, their leader was named Pelayo. And in 722, having previously refused to pay the jizya tax imposed on non-Muslims, Pelayo and the men under his command engaged in combat against a band of Moorish troops…and won, here in Covadonga. After this military success, Pelayo would move to nearby Cangas de Onís and establish the Kingdom of Asturias, the first Christian realm founded after the Muslim conquest.\n\nStatue to Pelayo\n\nMuslim chronicles obviously downplay the significance of the Battle of Covadonga, a small skirmish against ragtag mountain men on the caliphate’s fringe. But this battle would enjoy a huge status in the Spanish mythos, because to Christian Spaniards it represented the first battle in the centuries-long struggle to push the Moors out of Spain, a struggle they called the Reconquista because it was an attempt to “re-conquer” the peninsula. Reality was much more complex than this tidy propaganda makes it sound, but that’s a story for another day.\n\nChristian dominion would later expand west to Galicia, south to León, and east to Castilla; i.e., from Asturias, the predecessors of the modern Kingdom of Spain were born. As the saying goes, “Asturias is Spain, and all the rest is conquered land.”\n\nThe Holy Cave of Covadonga\n\nSmall cliffside chapel\n\nIt’s not surprising, then, that Spaniards go on pilgrimage to Covadonga, much in the same way Americans visit battlegrounds in New England or the American South that played a major role in the Revolution or the Civil War.\n\nAccording to legend, the Virgin Mary appeared during the battle to help the Christian warriors. Today there is a small chapel dedicated to this apparition of Mary, la Virgen de Covadonga, perched precariously in, so they say, the very same cave where Pelayo and his soldiers camped out. An ornately-decorated statue called La Santina draws the faithful from all across the country every year.\n\nBurial place of Pelayo\n\nAdditionally, Covadonga contains the tomb of Don Pelayo himself. He was originally buried in Cangas de Onís, the first capital of Asturias, but his remains were moved here in the 1200s, further adding to the historical significance of the area.\n\nA neo-medieval basilica\n\nPerched high on a hilltop\n\nFacing the Santa Cueva is an imposing, turn-of-the-century basilica built in honor of the Virgin of Covadonga. Constructed in attractive pink limestone, the austere, Romanesque Revival church was finished in 1901 and commands the tiny hilltop that makes up Covadonga.\n\nInside the moody church\n\nApart from the pretty pink stone and dramatic backdrop, there isn’t much to see in this relatively-new basilica.\n\nNext stop: the Picos de Europa\n\nThe steep, fog-covered hills\n\nWhen I visited Covadonga as part of a road trip my housemates and I did together last fall, it was a short pitstop on our way to enjoy the beautiful scenery of the Picos de Europa National Park. Covadonga is about halfway between the town of Cangas de Onís and the stunning glacial Lake Enol. More to come in the next few days!\n\nHad you heard about Covadonga before? What’s your opinion: re-conquest or simply “conquest”? Debate below in the discussion thread!\n\nIs St. James Really Buried in Santiago de Compostela, Spain?\n\nAs you head down a curve of the busy San Pedro street, you catch your first view of the twin bell towers of the cathedral of Santiago de Compostela—and you catch your breath. Petite hatchbacks rattle across the cobblestone as your feet seem drawn farther down the path, although that might just be gravity pulling you downhill toward the old zone. You cinch up your backpack’s sternum strap for the final approach of this multiple-night pilgrimage. For not the first time on your Camino, you lose your sense of direction as you enter Santiago’s old town: granite flagstones at your feet, stone-and-graying-plaster houses on either side, and overcast skies above disorient you—yet your eyes eventually lock on to a spray-painted yellow arrow on the side of a building. Once you’re back on autopilot, you start to reflect on why you started this crazy, 70-mile-plus hike in the first place. Rúa de San Pedro, Santiago de Compostela Maybe you hiked from Sarria farther inland as a cheap and hea\n\nA Crash Course in the Galician Language\n\nGalicia, located in Spain’s northwestern corner, is one of the country’s greatest regions. When I lived there from 2013 to 2015, I couldn’t get enough of the glorious, fresh food , the green, lush countryside, and the grand, granite architecture . But I could only take canned sardines with me back home, we’ve got enough humidity here in Texas, and sadly the oldest buildings in suburban Plano date back not to the 1070s but the 1970s.

This place has got some serious magic about it... // #flowers #spring #park #santiago #santiagodecompostela #galicia #spain #vsco #vscocam A post shared by Trevor Huxham (@trevorhuxham) on Mar 13, 2014 at 1:29pm PDT But what has stuck with me the most has been galego , the Galician language that I quickly picked up on after being immersed in it from day one at the elementary school I worked at. Clo\n\nMont-Saint-Michel, France: An Island Fortress in the English Channel\n\nAfter Paris and the Bayeux Tapestry , the third thing I wanted to see while traveling in France was Mont-Saint-Michel , a towering monastery built on top of a mountainous island off the coast of Normandy. Before visiting, I really didn’t know much at all about the Mount except that it was only accessible when the tides were out…and that it looked just plain cool. During the visit, I ended up learning a bit about French history and why the Mount is such a big deal for the French people. Mont-Saint-Michel It was by sheer luck, though, that I was able to visit Mont-Saint-Michel at all (pronounced “mohn san mee-shehl” [mɔ̃ sɛ̃ mi.ʃɛl]). The very day I had chosen to visit Mont-Saint-Michel was the first day in weeks that the tourist bus was running between Saint-Malo (where my hostel was) and the Mount, with maybe one or two other runs more for December. I paid 20€ for the round-trip service but didn’t complain because this really freaky coincidence made the whole visit possible."
