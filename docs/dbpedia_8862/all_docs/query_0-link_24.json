        "text": "The bridge and the Cruz de la Victoria\n\nAn iron cross hangs from the \"Roman bridge\" of Cangas de Onís, over the River Sella, to commemorate the ancient past of this town. It is a replica of the legendary Cruz de la Victoria, now in the Sacred Chamber of the Cathedral of Oviedo, which King Pelayo raised at the Battle of Covadonga.\n\nThe Cruz de la Victoria, the heraldic emblem of the Principality of Asturias, was donated to the church of San Salvador de Oviedo by King Alphonse III the Great in 908. It consists of two pieces of wood, 920 mm high and 720 mm wide, overlaid with gold, stones and enamels. On the back are several inscriptions in Latin. It has a hollow centre for relics.\n\nTwo unequal arches flank both sides of the central, canted-arch. In fact, this bridge was built over a Roman road in the Middle Ages, between the fourteenth and fifteenth centuries, during the reign of King Alphonse XI. The \"pontoon\", which divides the counties of Cangas de Onís and Parres, has been designated a Historic Artistic Monument.\n\nMonastery of San Pedro de Villanueva\n\nThe Monastery of San Pedro de Villanueva (12th - 18th century) was restored and transformed into a Parador in 1998. Located on the banks of the River Sella, the Parador Nacional de Cangas de Onís is one of the Romanesque jewels of Asturias.\n\nDeclared a National Monument in 1907, the building is pre-Roman, although there is little material evidence available, only a few walls inside the Parador. The church of this former Benedictine monastery preserves the original Romanesque floor plan, as well as the circular apses and various decorative elements. It also has baroque elements, such as the tower and cloister.\n\nThe artists who decorated the church were considered the best in Asturias in their time (12th -13th centuries), their skill and technique on a par with the artists who created the \"Apostolado\" in the Sacred Chamber in Oviedo, a masterpiece of Romanesque Spanish sculpture. The preserved doorways are unsurpassed in beauty. The capitals depict scenes of chivalry, like the farewell between the falconer and Lady, as well as high quality animal and plants motifs."
