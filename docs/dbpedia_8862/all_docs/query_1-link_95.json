        "text": "El gran sueño - Cangas de Onís: 35 km / 35 mins\n\nIn Cangas de Onís we recommend parking, especially if it is Sunday, market day, at the Parking Grande, next to the Bus Station. From here, simply cross the pedestrian bridge over the river, and you'll practically be in the center of what was once the first capital of the Kingdom of Asturias (until the year 774). Notable landmarks include: the Capilla de la Santa Cruz (Chapel of the Holy Cross), where King Favila, the second king of Asturias and the son of King Pelayo, is buried; and the Puente Romano (Roman Bridge) over the Sella River. Although it's not actually Roman but medieval, from the 14th century, it remains one of the most iconic and photographed spots in Asturias. You should also explore the Plaza del Mercado (Market Square), calle de San Pelayo (San Pelayo Street), the old town with the Iglesia de la Asunción (church of the Assumption) and the statue of King Pelayo. Don't miss Casa Riera, located in front of the Roman Bridge, which is a fine example of Indian architecture, and currently serves as the tourist office.\n\nCangas de Onís - Lakes of Covadonga: 22.5 km / 38 mins\n\nJust 9 km / 10 minutes away from Cangas de Onís, you'll find Covadonga, and 12 km from Covadonga are the Lakes of Covadonga (los Lagos). There are two lakes: first, we'll see Lake Enol, and then Lake Ercina, where the road ends. From the latter, it's worth taking the circular route round the lakes (PR-PNE2), which is 5.7 km long and takes about two hours. If you're up for more walking, you can extend it with the circular route round the Buferrera Mines, which is 3.1 km. In this incredibly beautiful area, words are simply insufficient to describe its beauty.\n\nLakes of Covadonga - Covadonga: 13.5 km / 28 mins\n\nCovadonga is a monumental complex of great importance for Asturias and Spain. It was here, in 722, that the Reconquista began when King Pelayo, leader of the Visigoths, won the battle that prevented the Moors from advancing further into these lands. It's worth visiting the basilica, which was constructed between 1886 and 1901, and the Holy Cave of the Virgin of Covadonga, a traditional pilgrimage site for many, both from Asturias and beyond. We prefer to access the cave through the upper entrance, at the same level as the basilica. After viewing the image of the Virgin of Covadonga and the tomb of King Pelayo, we descend the stairs to the fountain just below, from where you must take a photo of the sanctuary. And remember, don't drink from the 7 spouts of this fountain if you don't want to get married.\n\nMore about Covadonga and its Lakes\n\nThe three previous visits (Cangas de Onís, Covadonga, and the Lakes) can be done in any order you prefer. For us, for example, we like to save the Lakes of Covadonga for the afternoon, especially on sunny days, as there's beautiful light and fewer people.\n\nCovadonga - El gran sueño: 39.5 km / 50 mins\n\nWe want to inform you that, to return to El gran sueño, the map above indicates that we should turn off from the N-634, after Sevares, onto the AS-259 to the right (passing through Miyares and Vallobal), and then take the PI-9 to the left (through Cadanes). However, it's not necessary, though it can be interesting if you want to see something new. If you prefer to take the familiar route, you can continue on the N-634 until you pass Infiesto. When you reach the intersections, first you'll find Villaviciosa (AS-255), and immediately after, Pintueles (AS-258), both to the right."
