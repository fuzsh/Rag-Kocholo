        "text": "Parador de Cangas de Onís - Medieval Monastery (4*)\n\nBeautifully set on the verdant banks of the River Sella at the foot of the spectacular Picos de Europa, between Oviedo and Santander and a mile or so outside the little town of Cangas de Onis, the superb Parador de Cangas was once the monastery of San Pedro de Villanueva.\n\nThe buildings, which date from the 12th to the 18th century, have been declared a National Monument and have endured significant changes over the years including some remodelling and redesigning around a two story cloister.\n\nCangas’ Parador has a modern wing which has been sympathetically designed in harmony with the historical originals and which houses the standard bedrooms. Superior rooms are located in the original monastery building. The monastery is linked to the annexe by a covered walkway. Some rooms are traditional in style, some more modern, all spacious and very comfortable and the Parador as a whole works well to maintain its original history and charm.\n\nThis hotel offers visitors to Cangas de Onis peace and tranquillity. Guests can take time to wander through the gardens and cloisters, while enjoying all the luxuries of a 4-star hotel. Guests can sit back and relax in the comfortable lounge area next to the open fire or in the beautiful Baroque cloister, enjoying the secluded environment. The Parador’s hallways have stone walls and traditional paintings and the restaurant is bright and spacious with lots of light coming in from the large windows.\n\nThe Parador de Cangas de Onis is set in a very beautiful location, the perfect place from which to admire the stunning landscape of the Picos de Europa and is an excellent base for exploring the local area on foot.\n\nThere is a wide variety of activities available nearby, especially in the Picos including walking, fishing, riding, canoeing and mountain biking.\n\nThere are also many wonderful sights to see in Cangas de Onis such as the 5–arched Roman bridge and the Roman Catholic Santa Cruz chapel as well as many more stunning examples of Romanesque and Gothic architecture.\n\nThe Roman bridge is particularly significant within the town as it welcomes travellers for their ascent to Covadonga and to the famous lakes. For those who follow the Pilgrim’s way to Santiago, they go from here directly to Gijon, travelling from Asturias by the coastal route.\n\nFor those who love nature, exploring the Picos de Europa National park is a must. And in addition, guests can also visit the local caves to explore some of the rock formations from the Palaeolithic period. The Picos de Europa national park is home to the village of Covadonga, which was the site of a famous battle in the year 722. This battle is remembered as being the first major Christian victory of the region, ensuring the independence of the Kingdom of Asturias. Cangas de Onis offers many different excursions and sporting activities, and these can be organised through one of the local companies. With such a variety of options, guests are sure to find something for everyone. The town is also not far from local beaches such as Ribadesella and Llanes for those who prefer to spend time relaxing by the coast.\n\nASTURIAS\n\nThe Principality of Asturias is one of the smaller Autonomous Communities of Spain, but lacks nothing in terms of attractiveness to lovers of nature, countryside and beautiful landscapes.\n\nForming part of ‘Green Spain’ which extends across the north-west of the country , the 375 km coastline along the Bay of Biscay contributes to the mild climate of this region: summer temperatures average 16°C -18°C and rarely fall below 12°C in winter. Except in the mountains of course, and mountains, in the shape of the Picos de Europa National Park, are undoubtedly one of the main attractions of rural Asturias.\n\nThe Picos, rising to over 2,500 metres, are serious mountains extending south into the neighbouring province of León and providing the most glorious scenery. Particularly beautiful is the area of the Covadonga lakes, reached in less than half an hour by car from the Parador at Cangas de Onís: the route passes the Sanctuary of Covadonga, reputedly the site of the 8th century battle where the Moorish forces were defeated, heralding the beginning of the Reconquest and the birth of the Asturian monarchy.\n\nThe principal cities in Asturias are Oviedo (the capital), Gijón (the most populated with 270,000 inhabitants) and Avilés (an industrial and fishing centre) – all in the north of the Principality and each with its ‘casco antiguo’, or historical centre, and all three of them well worth visiting. But, for this writer, the main attraction of Asturias is its varied countryside, with scores of small towns and villages dotted around the landscape and home to so many varied and protected species of flora and fauna, including the brown bear and the ‘capercaillie’, a species of wood grouse.\n\nWith its proximity to the sea, Asturian cuisine naturally includes many sea-food dishes including ‘sopa de marisco’ (a form of bouillabaisse), ‘pescados a la sidra’ (fish - often hake - in cider) and grilled bonito. Apart from this, Asturias is also known for its fresh local farm produce, including the widest range of local artisan cheeses of any region of Spain - notably ‘Cabrales’, a delicious blue cheese matured in caves. The indisputable number one Asturian dish is ‘Fabada Asturiana,’ a heavy stew made with ‘fabes’ – a type of large broad bean – and pork, black pudding, chorizo …sensational! Or, for the fainter- hearted, ‘fabes con almejas’(clams) are also delicious. The regional drink is cider, but locally produced wine can also be found virtually everywhere."
