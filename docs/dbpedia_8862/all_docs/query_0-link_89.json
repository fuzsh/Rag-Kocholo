        "text": "FRUELA I\n\nKing of Asturias\n\nTHE CRUEL\n\n(born c. 740 - died 768)\n\npictured above is an imagined portrait of the King of Asturias, by Bernardino Montañés from 1854\n\n——————– ~ ——————– ~ ——————–\n\nSERIES - Descendants of the Kings of Asturias: Fruela was the fourth King of Asturias from 757.\n\n——————– ~ ——————– ~ ——————–\n\nFRUELA was probably born around 740, in the Kingdom of Asturias. He was the eldest son of Alfonsu I, King of Asturias and Ermesinda, and thus, he was a member of a branch line of the ASTUR-LEONESE DYNASTY and was also from birth an INFANTE OF ASTURIAS.\n\nWhen his father died around 757, the Asturian people elected him as their new Monarch, and he reigned as FRUELA I, KING OF ASTURIAS.\n\nIn the early years of his reign, he fought against the Emirate of Córdoba that tried to invade the region of Galicia. And, he also had to suppress an invasion of Basques from Álava in his Cantabrian lands.\n\nAround the time of the Basque invasion in the 750s, it is believed that he decided to marry one of them. After he defeated them, he probably took home with him a certain MUNIA, as his wife. She is known as MUNIA OF ÁLAVA and they had at least one son and possibly two other children (check the list below).\n\nBut there are controversies about his wife’s origins. Some believe that her father was a certain Oveco, of Basque origins, and others that he was a Navarrese noble named Lope. And, other sources also believe that her mother could have been a daughter of Fruela of Cantabria, an uncle of her new husband.\n\nBy 761, he supported two Benedictine monks Máximo and Fromestanu for the foundation of the Church of San Vicente de Oviedo. This Church would later be converted to a Monastery and was the origin of the city of Oviedo.\n\nHe murdered his younger brother Infante Vimaranu in 767 because he was jealous of his popularity. It is said that regretful of his acts, he took care of his nephew Bermudu.\n\nHowever, the angry nobility never forgave him, and the King of Asturias was also murdered in 768, in Cangas de Onís, the capital of Asturias. He was probably in his late twenties.\n\n——————– ~ ——————– ~ ——————–\n\nAfter he died, some sources say that his widow took refuge with his children at the Monastery of San Xulián de Samos in Galicia. However, other sources say that she was buried with him soon after his death.\n\nWhat is certainly known is that when he died, his eldest son Infante Alfonsu was still a child, and so the Asturian nobility decided to elect another person to become their Monarch. The chosen one was his cousin, Aureliu of Cantabria.\n\n——————– ~ ——————– ~ ——————–\n\nCheck my posts on FRUELA I’s family, his Royal House, and his Kingdom!\n\nFRUELA I and his wife MUNIA may have had three children…\n\nAlfonsu II, King of Asturias - possible husband of Bertinalda;\n\npossibly an unnamed daughter - possible wife of Nepocianu, King of Asturias; and\n\npossibly Román - nothing is known about him.\n\nHe was a member of a branch line of the Astur-Leonese Dynasty."
