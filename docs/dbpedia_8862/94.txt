CANGAS DE ONIS IN ASTURIAS: GATEWAY TO PICOS DE EUROPA

Cangas de Onís is a picturesque town located in the Asturias region of northern Spain. It is nestled in the foothills of the Picos de Europa National Park, offering stunning natural landscapes and a rich cultural heritage.

Cangas de Onís holds historical importance: it became the first capital of the Kingdom of Asturias in the 8th century.

Sidenote: While it’s officially spelled “Cangas de Onís” with an accent over the “i” in Spain, American keyboards don’t typically have that option easily available. So please excuse the slight grammatical inaccuracy through this post!

Cangas de Onis: Gateway to Picos de Europa National Park

Picos de Europa National Park, or Parque Nacional de los Picos de Europa in Spanish, is a stunning natural reserve located in Northern Spain.

Picos is of the country’s most renowned national parks, known for its rugged peaks, deep valleys, dramatic cliffs, and diverse flora and fauna.

Bus / Shuttle from Cangas de Onis to Picos de Europa

During parts of the year, you cannot drive yourself into Picos de Europa from Cangas de Onis.

You’ll have to park at either the bus station in Cangas, or up in one of the lots at Covadonga, and take the shuttle in.

The gates up to the national park close by 7:30am. If you’d like to drive your own car, get there before 7:30!

PRO TIP: Don’t drive yourself! I’m the first to admit: I did *not* want to take the bus to the national park. In retrospect, it’s an excellent option, and the shuttle system is very-well organized!

I would suggest taking the shuttle bus from the bus station in Cangas de Onis all the way.

The cost is 9 Euros (roundtrip!), and it will stop at both Covadonga and the visitor center parking lot near the lakes in the park (Lagos de Covadonga).

The road itself through Picos de Europa National Park is essentially one-lane in parts, as it winds up through the mountains. It runs right along the cliffs, reminding me of Glacier National Park’s “Going to the Sun Road” in Montana.

While it’s not overly-crowded, the combination of the narrow road, plus the cows and goats blocking the way will have you happy to have someone else behind the wheel!

The shuttle bus will take 15 minutes to get from Cangas de Onis to Covadonga, and another 30 minutes to get to the hiking trails at the lakes.

A bus will hit each stop every 30 minutes. Some allow dogs and bikes.

The final bus from the lakes runs at 8:00pm / 20:00 each night back to Cangas de Onis.

Covadonga Sanctuary

The most prominent building is the Basilica of Covadonga, which is a grand neo-Romanesque church on the cliff.

Constructed between 1877 and 1901, it was designed by the Spanish architect Roberto Frassinelli. The basilica is dedicated to the Virgin of Covadonga, also known as La Santina, who is considered the patroness of Asturias.

Masses are said here frequently.

Chapel in the Cave of Covadonga

The Chapel in the Cave of Covadonga, also known as the Holy Cave or Santa Cueva, is closely associated with the Reconquista, a period in medieval Spanish history when Christian forces sought to reclaim the Iberian Peninsula from Muslim rule.

According to legend, in the year 722, a small Christian army led by Don Pelayo took refuge in the mountainous terrain around Covadonga to escape the Moorish forces. Seeking divine assistance, Don Pelayo and his troops sought the protection of the Virgin Mary. It is said that during the battle, a hidden cave provided a sanctuary for the Christians, and with the Virgin’s intercession, they achieved an unlikely victory against the Moors.

In commemoration of this event, a small chapel was constructed inside the cave. The original chapel was built in the 8th century, but over the centuries, it has undergone several modifications and renovations. The present-day chapel, which dates back to the 19th century, is a simple structure with a facade made of pink limestone.

You’re likely to see a mass being held on your visit, which you can hear echoing through the area.

Covadonga Monastery

The Monastery of San Pedro de Villanueva is a medieval monastery dating back to the 12th century. It is an architectural gem, showcasing Romanesque and Gothic elements.

The Roman Bridge is the most famous landmark in Cangas de Onis, but there’s much more to see and do on a visit!

The Roman Bridge

The Roman Bridge in Cangas de Onis, known as the “Puente Romano,” is an iconic symbol of the region and one of the most significant Roman structures in northern Spain.

The bridge spans the Sella River, and is believed to have been built by the Romans during the 1st or 2nd century AD. The bridge is constructed of large stone blocks and features semicircular arches, a common architectural style used by the Romans in.

The bridge measures around 60 meters in length and stands about 10 meters above the river. It’s open to pedestrians to cross.

The “Cruz de la Victoria” (Cross of Victory) hangs from the center. This cross is a replica of the original, which is housed in the nearby Santa Cruz Chapel. The Cruz de la Victoria is a Christian relic associated with the victory of King Pelayo over the Moors in the Battle of Covadonga in 722 AD. It holds great religious and historical significance for the region.

Over the centuries, the Roman Bridge has undergone several restorations and repairs to maintain its structural integrity. It has survived various floods and natural disasters. Today, it stands as a remarkable testament to Roman engineering and serves as a popular tourist attraction, offering beautiful views of the surrounding landscape.

Santa Cruz, or the Holy Cross, is a chapel which dates back to the 16th century, although some historical accounts suggest that an earlier chapel existed on the same site.

The “Cruz de la Victoria” (Cross of Victory) is inside the chapel. It’s a cross made of gold and gems, and is an important Christian relic. The cross represents the victory of King Pelayo and the Battle of Covadonga in 722 AD, and the triumph of Christianity over the Moorish invaders.

The original Cruz de la Victoria is considered a symbol of the Asturian monarchy and is now kept in the Museum of Covadonga. However, a replica of the cross is permanently displayed inside the Santa Cruz Chapel for visitors and pilgrims to see.
