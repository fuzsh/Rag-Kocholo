While flying probably over the north part of Siberia, maybe over the Arctic Ocean, the aircraft disappeared after all radio communications ceased. Important SAR operations were initiated but were eventually suspended few weeks later as no trace of the aircraft nor the six crew members was found. Among the six aviators was the famous Soviet aviation pioneer Sigismond Levanevsky.\n\nCrew:\n\nSigismond Levanevsky, captain,\n\nNikolai Kastanayev, second pilot,\n\nNikolai Galkovsky, radio operator,\n\nGrigory Pobezhimov, flight engineer,\n\nNikolai Godovikov, flight engineer,\n\nViktor Levchenko, navigator.\n\nProbable cause:\n\nAccording to Soviet Authorities, weather information transmitted to the crew were inaccurate and did not reflect the truth."
