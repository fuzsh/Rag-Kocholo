Chertok devotes a significant portion of the volume to the origins and development of the N-1 rocket, the superbooster developed by the Korolev design bureau in the 1960s as a counterpart to the American SaturnV. Chertok's department at OKB-1 was responsible for developing the control systems for the N-1, a monumental and challenging task made more complicated by the use of 30 rocket engines on its first stage. Chertok's descriptions of the four failed launches of the N-1 combine a keen sense of the technological issues with the human dimensions of scientific and technical work. One of the values of this volume is Chertok's lengthy description of the origins of the Soviet space station program, which began with the Salyut space stations in the early 1970s and concluded with the multimodule \"Mir \"complex in the 1980s. Chertok shows how the space station grew out of a combination of dissatisfaction with the Moon program, available hardware from a military space station project known as Almaz, and the initiative of a group of senior designers (including Chertok) at the Korolev design bureau. Perhaps the most poignant chapters here are the ones on the tragic Soyuz-11 mission when cosmonauts Dobrovolskiy, Volkov, and Patsayev were killed on reentry. Chertok concludes the book with a lengthy description of the end of the N-1 program and the birth of the Energiya-Buran program under the leadership of Valentin Glushko. His account provides a fascinating inside look at the political, technological, and personal conflicts at a time when the Soviet space program was at its zenith.

In 1930, he began work as an electrician at one of the largest aviation factories in the Soviet Union, Factory No. 22 (where the current Khrunichev State Space Scientific-Production Center is located). In 1934, he began work at the design bureau of Viktor Bolkhovitinov, a noted designer of bombers. There, during the war, he contributed to the development of the BI, the first Soviet rocket-plane launched under its own power. He graduated in 1939 from the Moscow Power Institute.\n\nAfter the war, in 1945 and 1946, he was involved in Soviet efforts to recover German rocket technology. In Germany, he played an active role in founding the Institute Rabe, where many prominent Soviet engineers studied wartime rocket technology. Beginning in 1946, Chertok headed the control systems department at the famous NII-88 institute outside of Moscow and worked hand in hand with legendary Chief Designer Sergey Korolev. Chertok became one of Korolev s closest aides in developing control systems for ballistic missiles and spacecraft, eventually becoming deputy chief designer of the famous OKB-1, the organization that spun off from NII-88 in 1956. Chertok participated in every major project at OKB-1 (now known as the Energiya Rocket-Space Corporation, RKK Energiya) until the dissolution of the Soviet Union in 1991, when he retired from active work.\n\nChertok was elected a full (active) member of the Russian Academy of Sciences in 1991. He still serves as the Chief Scientific Consultant to RKK Energiya. His four-volume memoirs \"Rakety i lyudi\" (\"Rockets and People\") were originally published in Moscow between 1994 and 1999.\n\n\""
