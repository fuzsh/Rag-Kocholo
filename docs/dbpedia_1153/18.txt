Circumstances:

The crew was performing a transpolar flight from Moscow to New York with intermediate stops in Fairbanks and Chicago. While flying probably over the north part of Siberia, maybe over the Arctic Ocean, the aircraft disappeared after all radio communications ceased. Important SAR operations were initiated but were eventually suspended few weeks later as no trace of the aircraft nor the six crew members was found. Among the six aviators was the famous Soviet aviation pioneer Sigismond Levanevsky.
