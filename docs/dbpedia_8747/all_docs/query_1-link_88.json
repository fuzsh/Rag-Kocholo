I will follow Voegelin’s declarations before introducing my own theoretical proposals. In particular, I will focus on three concepts proposed by Whitehead that resonate in Voegelin’s thought, namely those of “climate of opinion,” “fallacy of misplaced concreteness,” and “process.” By highlighting the intellectual continuity between these two thinkers (while not obscuring their crucial differences), I will reflect upon their place within the historical trajectory of ideas."
