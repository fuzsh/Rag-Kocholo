        "meta_description": "This work is the first book-length criticism of the political philosophy of Eric Voegelin.  \r\nThis book demonstrates that despite his assertions to the contrary, Voegelin harbored long-standing partisan ideological leanings.  After a thorough explication of both primary and secondary Voegelin literature, the author scrutinizes Voegelin’s claims of essential agreement between Plato and Aristotle; his attacks on Marx and Hegel; and his analysis of the character of a modern ‘gnostic.’  The concluding chapter places the ‘Voegelin phenomenon’ in the context of contemporary American political cleavages.",
