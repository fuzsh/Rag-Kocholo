        "text": "MICHAEL HENRY is Professor of Philosophy at St.\n\nJohn’s University in New York City.\n\nIn his 1965 Ingersoll Lecture “Immortality:\n\nExperience and Symbol” Eric\n\nVoegelin declared that “the symbolism of\n\nincarnation would express the experience,\n\nwith a date in history, of God reaching into\n\nman and revealing him as the Presence that\n\nis the flow of presence from the beginning of\n\nthe world to its end. History is Christ written\n\nlarge.”1 Despite the fact that the Incarnation\n\nwas a subject to which Voegelin devoted\n\nrelatively little space in his extensive writings,\n\nas this statement indicates it does play a\n\ncritical role in his philosophy. Nevertheless,\n\nas Mark Mitchell observed at the beginning\n\nof an essay critical of Voegelin, “Eric\n\nVoegelin’s treatment of Christianity is notoriously\n\nproblematic”2 in the sense that it\n\ndemands at the very least a revaluation of the\n\nmeaning of core Christian beliefs, particularly,\n\nas some critics have pointed out, the\n\nTrinity, the Incarnation, and the Resurrection.\n\nGerhart Niemeyer, for example, who\n\ndeeply admired and was greatly influenced\n\nby Voegelin’s work, nonetheless expressed\n\ndisappointment at Voegelin’s inadequate\n\ntreatment of the historical person of Christ in\n\nThe Ecumenic Age.3 Mitchell argues that\n\nbecause Voegelin’s philosophy cannot account\n\nfor fallen human nature and salvation it\n\nis “simply inadequate.”4 David Walsh characterized\n\nVoegelin’s treatment of Christianity\n\nas incomplete and unsatisfactory, Bruce\n\nDouglass argued that Voegelin lacks “a sense\n\nof the Gospel as salvation in the specifically\n\nChristian sense,” and others such as John\n\nGueguen and Frederick Wilhelmsen have\n\nalso pointed out what they see as significant\n\nproblems in Voegelin’s understanding of\n\nChristianity.5 Ultimately all of these criticisms\n\nraise a question about Voegelin’s understanding\n\nof Christ and the Incarnation.\n\nDespite their serious reservations about\n\nthe implications of Voegelin’s philosophy for\n\nChristian belief, these same critics do not\n\nreject Voegelin’s philosophy out of hand\n\nbecause they find too much common ground\n\nwith Ellis Sandoz who “never doubted that\n\nVoegelin was profoundly Christian” (although\n\nnot a “Christian philosopher” because of his\n\ndesire to maintain an impartial stance) since\n\n“the whole of his discourse was luminous\n\nwith devotion to the truth of divine reality.”6\n\nThat is, Voegelin’s philosophy resonates so\n\npowerfully with the soul’s hunger for God\n\nthat it cannot be simply dismissed. This\n\ncreates a dilemma for Christians who believe\n\nin traditional Christianity but also find profound\n\ntruth in Voegelin. I shall argue that\n\ndespite the insights by which Voegelin en-\n\nhances our understanding of Scripture and\n\nChristianity there remains a fundamental\n\nincongruity between his philosophical analysis\n\nof the Incarnation and traditional Christian\n\nbelief.\n\nTo be sure, Voegelin did not claim to be\n\nan apologist for Christian doctrines. What he\n\ndid, implicitly, claim was that he had grasped\n\nbetter than anyone in modern times the true\n\npre-dogmatic meaning of Christianity, not\n\nas a theologian but as a philosopher who\n\nbegan to reflect on Christianity in order to\n\nunderstand its effects on political phenomena\n\n(although his meditations eventually took\n\nhim far beyond this). In his New Year’s Day,\n\n1953 letter to Alfred Schutz he explained that\n\nhis interest in Christianity was not based on\n\nreligion but on the impossibility, for a serious\n\n“theoretician of politics,” of simply ignoring\n\n“1500 years of Christian thought and Christian\n\npolitics.” The rational and responsible\n\nphilosopher’s requirement to attend to Christian\n\nthought means that he must concede the\n\nclearer insight into, and articulations of,\n\nexperiences of reality wherever they occur,\n\nfor example in Christianity’s reinterpreting\n\nthe philosopher’s forced removal from the\n\ncave in Plato’s parable as the new understanding\n\nof “the experienced intrusion of\n\ntranscendence into human life which can\n\nbreak in from outside so overwhelmingly\n\nthat it may call human freedom into question.”\n\n7 The nature and history of Christianity\n\ncompel the objective “theoretician of\n\npolitics” not to “throw Christianity overboard”\n\nbut to analyze its symbolization of\n\ntranscendence experiences along with all of\n\nthe historical consequences of this articulation,\n\njust as he would have to analyze every\n\nother phenomenon that has had political\n\nramifications. Sandoz was certainly right in\n\nhis observation that Voegelin was not a\n\n“Christian philosopher” because of his desire\n\nto maintain a “dispassionate even fiercely\n\nindependent stance of impartiality.”8\n\nThat Voegelin’s objective philosophical\n\napproach to understanding Christ and Christianity\n\nresulted in the rejection of traditional\n\ntheology as a distinct form of inquiry is\n\napparent in his 1970 comment in response to\n\na question at a panel discussion at the Thomas\n\nMore Institute that “If you were to speak of\n\ntheology in the Christian sense, we would get\n\ninto problems, because there is no theology\n\nin the Christian sense which is not at the same\n\ntime philosophy, also.”9 What he meant is\n\nsomewhat ambiguous, for his comment could\n\nmean either that Christian doctrine is formulated\n\nusing the concepts developed in Greek\n\nphilosophy, formulations that succeeded only\n\nin deforming and burying the symbolism of\n\nthe Gospel under “two thousand years’ accretion,”\n\nor that philosophy in the true sense\n\nis the only way to approach Christian theology.\n\nFor Voegelin it could and probably did\n\nmean both. To understand Jesus Voegelin\n\nsaid that he had to “go back of theology and\n\nwork directly on the sources of the time [of\n\nthe Gospels].”10 In a response to a question at\n\na panel discussion Voegelin deplored the use,\n\nat the Council of Chalcedon in the fifth\n\ncentury, of inadequate substantive terms\n\n(terms which Voegelin said he himself would\n\nnever use) to “solve a problem, which is an\n\nentirely ridiculous problem in theology, on\n\nthe basis of the depositum fidei,“11 by defining\n\nChrist as one person who is a hypostatic\n\nunion of human nature and divine nature,\n\nmeaning that Christ is, mysteriously, truly\n\nand fully God and truly and fully man.\n\nVoegelin did not, however, consider the\n\nuse of Greek philosophy by Christian theologians\n\nentirely unfortunate. In “The Gospel\n\nand Culture” he points out that Christianity\n\nhad no choice but to enter “the life of reason\n\nin the form of Hellenistic philosophy”12 in\n\norder to avoid failure as an obscure sect, that\n\nis, Christianity needed to adopt the philosophical\n\nlanguage understood by the educated\n\npeople of the time to articulate its\n\ninsights into transcendence. But Voegelin\n\nsaw this as more than just the expedient of\n\nadopting an already comprehensible and\n\nfamiliar vocabulary, for he mentions, as “an\n\nearly statement of the issue,” Justin Martyr’s\n\n“conception” that “the Logos of the gospel\n\nis rather the same Word of the same God as\n\nthe logos spermatikos of philosophy, but at a\n\nlater stage of its manifestation in history” and\n\ntherefore “Christianity is philosophy itself in\n\nits state of perfection.”13 The problem he\n\nfound in the alliance of Christianity with\n\nHellenistic philosophy is that even though\n\nphilosophical concepts were initially necessary\n\nto preserve the insights gained through\n\nexperiences of transcendence from those\n\nwho failed to understand, philosophically\n\nformulated doctrines and dogmas inevitably\n\nossified into verbal propositions that themselves\n\nbecame disconnected from the originating\n\nexperiences and, as a result, distorted\n\nthe meaning and lost the reality.\n\nOne of the few labels Voegelin would\n\naccept was “mystic philosopher,” by which\n\nhe meant that he searched for the meaning of\n\nthe dynamism of human consciousness as it\n\nsearches for and is illuminated by experiences\n\nof the ground of its existence, experiences\n\nit endeavors to express in symbols\n\nrather than in the propositional, factual statements\n\nof doctrine and dogma.14 This, of\n\ncourse, created a frame of reference so broad\n\nthat Christianity became one articulation of\n\ntranscendent experiences among many others.\n\nVoegelin rejected the distinction between\n\nrevealed truth and truth attained by\n\n“natural reason,” as he rejected the distinction\n\nbetween philosophy and faith, for he\n\nunderstood all truth to emerge from a divine-\n\nhuman encounter that is universal in\n\nman, who is the imago Dei, and he regarded\n\nfaith as the philosophical attitude of trusting\n\nopenness to transcendence. His conviction\n\nthat the truth of divine reality is universal\n\nand varies only in the adequacy, or “differentiation”\n\nof its symbolization along a continuum\n\nof theoretical insights15 is the reason\n\nwhy he often lists Christianity in the midst of\n\nother, more or less equivalent, symbolizations\n\nof such experiences—Platonic philosophy,\n\nHinduism, Buddhism, Zoroastrianism,\n\nConfucianism, Taoism, etc.—and he frequently\n\ncompares Christianity with Platonic\n\nphilosophy, finding it in some ways superior\n\nto Plato but in other ways inferior. For\n\nVoegelin Christianity is really better understood\n\nin terms of the more differentiated\n\nphilosophy that he was able to develop because\n\nof his deeper insight into the originating\n\nexperiences, rather than by the dogmatic\n\ntheology based on traditional concepts and\n\ncategories with an inferior articulation of\n\nreality. It is on the basis of this philosophical\n\nanalysis of universal encounters with the\n\ndivine that he said that “one has to recognize,\n\nand make intelligible, the presence of\n\nChrist in a Babylonian hymn, or a Taoist\n\nspeculation, or a Platonic dialogue, just as\n\nmuch as in a Gospel.”16 What, then, did\n\nChrist and Christianity mean to Voegelin\n\nand how did he philosophically arrive at the\n\nconclusion that history is specifically Christ\n\nwritten large?\n\nAn explanation of the meaning of Christ\n\nand the Incarnation for Voegelin must begin\n\nfrom one of his fundamental assumptions,\n\nthat the “nature” of our experience of ultimate\n\nreality is the flowing or flux of divine\n\npresence.17 It is on the basis of this assumption\n\nabout flux that Voegelin can make the\n\ninitially startling assertion that “existence is\n\nnot a fact.” Since the word “fact” comes\n\nfrom the Latin verb facio and means something\n\ndone, finished, accomplished, and since\n\nfor Voegelin human existence is best understood\n\nas movement, process, flux, because it\n\nis illuminated by the flowing divine presence\n\nin consciousness, “existence is the nonfact of\n\na disturbing movement in the In-Between of\n\nignorance and knowledge, of time and timelessness,\n\nof imperfection and perfection, of\n\nhope and fulfillment, and ultimately of life\n\nand death. From the experience of this movement,\n\nfrom the anxiety of losing the right\n\ndirection in this In-Between of darkness and\n\nlight, arises the inquiry concerning the meaning\n\nof life. But it does arise only because life\n\nis experienced as man’s participation in a\n\nmovement with a direction to be found or\n\nmissed. If man’s existence were not a movement\n\nbut a fact, it not only would have no\n\nmeaning but the question of meaning could\n\nnot even arise”18 because in a world of\n\nfacticity life has no direction but is only a\n\n“wasteland” of sterile “things.” This “inquiry\n\nconcerning the meaning of life” is\n\nphilosophy.\n\nVoegelin’s understanding of philosophy,\n\nwhich embraces his understanding of Christianity,\n\nflows from this sense of conscious\n\nhuman existence located in an unfathomable\n\nregion that can only be described, somewhat\n\napophatically, as neither this nor that, because\n\nas soon as one attempts to gain certainty\n\nby declaring precisely what it is in terms of\n\nour worldly concepts, we lose it. To refer to\n\nit as flux really means that it defies any\n\nattempt to confine it within humanly generated\n\ncategories. For this enigmatic region of\n\nexperience he adopted the Platonic symbol\n\nof the metaxy, the “In-Between,” the region\n\nof reality where human consciousness searches\n\nfor, is drawn by, and encounters the awesomely\n\nmysterious transcendent flux of divine\n\npresence. In his essay “Eternal Being in\n\nTime” he says that “in the philosophical\n\nexperience, neither does eternal being become\n\nan object in time nor is temporal being\n\ntransposed into eternity. We remain in the\n\n‘in between’, in a temporal flow of experience\n\nin which eternity is present. This flow\n\ncannot be dissected into past, present, and\n\nfuture of the world’s time, for at every point\n\nof the flow there is the tension toward the\n\ntranscending eternal being. This characteristic\n\nof the presence of eternal being in temporal\n\nflow may be best represented by the term\n\nflowing presence.“19 “Transcendence” and\n\n“immanence” denote not places but directions\n\nin the structure of reality encountered\n\nin the experience. Plato first used this symbol\n\nof the In-Between in The Symposium when\n\nSocrates asks Diotima whether Eros, the\n\npsychic force that drives the soul to seek the\n\ndivine, is a mortal or an immortal, and she\n\nreplies, using the preposition metaxy, that\n\nEros is neither but instead is in tension\n\n“between” them, partaking of both but not\n\nfully identifiable with either. This is the\n\nground of the experiences of transcendence\n\nthat cannot be described or defined but only\n\nsymbolized. Major problems arise, Voegelin\n\nbelieved, if the loss or obscuring of the\n\noriginal experience causes the symbol to\n\nharden into a literal truth or dogma that has\n\nthe effect of eliminating the tension by\n\ncreating the illusion of a certain grasp of\n\nTruth. I use the word “hardens” deliberately,\n\nbecause Voegelin thinks of metaxic\n\nexperiences as steeped in the tension of the\n\nfluidity and unpredictability of divine presence.\n\n20\n\nAll human beings, by virtue of having\n\nhuman consciousness, exist in the metaxy,\n\nalthough to varying degrees and with different\n\nlevels of tolerance for the tension and\n\nuncertainty in the experience of flow, change,\n\nappeal and response, movements and countermovements,\n\nand questioning that cannot be\n\ntranslated into propositions, all of which can\n\nbe only inadequately articulated as symbols\n\nthat are really meant to point others to their\n\nown metaxic experiences. The greater the\n\nawareness of the “structure” of this process\n\nthe greater the degree of what Voegelin calls\n\nthe “differentiation of consciousness.” When\n\nthe emphasis of the symbolization falls on the\n\nhuman quest for the divine and the anxiety\n\nof losing the right direction he uses the term\n\n“noetic.” When the emphasis is on the other\n\npole of this tension, the divine presence and\n\nthe “pull” that draws the soul beyond itself,\n\nthe term is “pneumatic.”21 For Voegelin\n\neither term points to the same uncontrollable\n\nand unpredictable flux that cannot be captured\n\nor communicated in the concepts developed\n\nto describe the “things” in the world\n\nof our sense experience. He follows Plato and\n\nAristotle in using the term “psyche” for the\n\nsensorium of divine reality, the site of “divine-\n\nhuman mutual participation, as the\n\nmetaleptic [participatory] reality,” and the\n\n“site in which the comprehensive reality\n\nbecomes luminous to itself.”22\n\nAs Voegelin put it, “the specific area of\n\nreality in which the process occurs…is neither\n\ndivine nor human, neither transcendent\n\nnor immanent, but rather has the character\n\nof an In-Between reality.” This means that\n\nthe partners, or poles, in the metaxy cannot\n\nbe “reified” into independent entities.\n\nTherefore, “neither must the divine partner\n\nbe hypostatized into an object, nor the\n\nhuman partner into a subject, of cognition.”\n\nConsciousness in the metaxy is not one of\n\nsubject-object, of human cognizance of an\n\nobjective thing. Rather it is a “process” in\n\nwhich divine mystery becomes “cognitively\n\nluminous” as the divine movement of “revelatory\n\nappeal” and the human counter-movement\n\nof “apperceptive and imaginative response.”\n\nIt is simply not the case that human\n\nbeings acquire conceptual knowledge of God\n\nas the object of knowledge in the metaxy.\n\nFurthermore, because the metaxy cannot be\n\ndichotomized into God and man, and because\n\nthe appeal and the response “belong to\n\nthe one reality that becomes luminous in the\n\nexperience” the language that erupts in the\n\nexperience “is as much divine as it is human,”\n\n23 that is, the divine and the human\n\nexpressions of the experiences of this inbetween\n\nencounter are indistinguishable.\n\nNow, the question that Voegelin says\n\n“Christian visionaries” must ask is “‘Who is\n\nthis Son of God?’—who is this Messiah, this\n\nChrist, this vessel of divinely immortal presence,\n\nthis living Word of the truth.”24 The\n\nbasic assumption in Voegelin’s Christology\n\nis that Christ can be spoken of as “the\n\nrepresentative human being,…the Son of\n\nGod incarnate in his full perfection” because\n\nhe dwelled in the metaxy more fully and\n\nintensely than other human beings.25 Rejecting\n\nall of the hypostatic terms of person,\n\nsubstance, and nature as distortions or loss of\n\nthe flowing divine presence, Voegelin found\n\nit much truer to reality to understand the\n\nimpenetrable mystery of the identity of Christ\n\nas one who was able to endure the highest\n\npossible tension of living fully in the metaxy,\n\nin the flux of divine presence, while other\n\nhuman beings have a lesser experience of\n\nmetaxic tension and reality.\n\nAlthough Voegelin refers to Christ by the\n\ntraditional term “Son of God” he did not\n\nmean that Christ was the Son, the Second\n\nPerson of the Trinity, or that Christ naturally\n\nhad a divine nature. The term “Son of God”\n\nhe traced to Ancient Egypt where “every\n\npharaoh [was] the son of God.”26 In the\n\nExodus story this symbol was transferred to\n\nthe Chosen people and was later transferred\n\nto Christ when he was baptized by John.\n\nThere is, therefore, according to Voegelin,\n\nnothing unique or unprecedented in bestowing\n\non Christ the title “Son of God” or\n\neven the “only-begotten Son,” for the history\n\nof the terms amounts to “the realization\n\nthat the existential presence of God is experienced\n\nin existence in consciousness.”27\n\nWhile in Israel and Revelation he does refer to\n\n“the Christian revelation that only God can\n\nbe the Son of God—the mystery expressed in\n\nTrinitarian theology and the Christology,”28\n\nit is not at all clear that he meant to say that\n\nChrist was truly God, because in his comments\n\non the dogma of the Trinity in his\n\nletter to Schutz he says that the achievement\n\nof this symbol is to combine the experiences\n\nof the radical transcendence of God (the\n\nFather) with the experiences of divine power\n\nover nature (the Son) and the Christian\n\ncommunity’s participation in the spirit (the\n\nHoly Spirit). If the Trinity symbolizes human\n\nexperiences of the divine but not what\n\nGod is in himself, then Trinitarian theology\n\ncannot say that Christ is the incarnation of\n\nthe Second Person of the Trinity.\n\nTo explain the meaning of “the Son of\n\nGod incarnate in his full perfection” Voegelin\n\nfrequently turned to the Epistle to the\n\nColossians29 where he found the critical passage\n\nexplaining what is meant by “incarnation”\n\nin the second chapter in which Paul\n\nsays that in Christ “katoikei pan to pleroma tes\n\ntheotetos,” that is, “dwells all the fullness of\n\ndivine reality,” as Voegelin preferred to\n\ntranslate the neologism theotes. “And if you\n\nread only Colossians and not [any other text],\n\nyou would assume that Christ is to be defined\n\n[…] as the optimal presence—the pleroma of\n\nparousia—of the divine in a human being,\n\nwhile all other human beings have lesser\n\npresences of the divine, and are only aware\n\nthat there is one person, the Christ, in whom\n\nthere is the pleroma of presence. And the\n\ntheotes is not identified as a personal god, but\n\nas…the presence of divine reality experienced\n\nin reality by the people who stand\n\naround and hear the Christ talk.”30 This is the\n\ncore of Voegelin’s Christology, that while\n\neveryone has some degree of participation in\n\ndivine reality, in the metaxy, simply because\n\nwe all have human consciousness, Christ is\n\nthe optimal Presence that is the fullness of the\n\nflowing divine presence “from the beginning\n\nof the world to its end.”\n\nWhen Voegelin analyzes the passage in\n\nMatthew (16:13-20) in which Jesus puts to\n\nhis disciples the question of who they believe\n\nhe is, he finds in the Gospel a careful distinction\n\nbetween the past experiences of divine\n\npresence in individuals called “prophets,”\n\nexperiences open to ordinary people who\n\nhave accordingly concluded that Christ is\n\none of the prophets, the disciples’ greater\n\nawareness that Christ is in some obscure way\n\ndifferent from the prophets, and Peter’s even\n\ngreater internal experience of divine presence\n\nthat enables him to discern “the even\n\nfuller presence of ‘the living God’ in Jesus.”\n\nPeter “recognizes” him as “the Son of the\n\nliving God,” which is another symbol for the\n\nfullness of divine reality, theotes. Voegelin\n\nthen comments that “the God of whom the\n\npneumatic visions are true has to be the\n\nanonymous theotes, the immortal Beyond\n\nthat can save from the struggle by its suffering\n\nparticipation in human existence. The apostolic\n\nvisionaries were better philosophers\n\nthan some of the doctrinaire theologians of\n\nour own time.”31\n\nVoegelin, of course, understands theotes to\n\nrefer to the presence within the metaxy of a\n\nnameless but immortal divine reality Beyond\n\nour world and consciousness, one that constitutes\n\nconsciousness by reaching into it, rather\n\nthan to a Trinity of Father, Son, and Holy\n\nSpirit. In fact, Voegelin understands theotes\n\nin a more Platonic than Christian sense. He\n\nexplains that he prefers the translation “divine\n\nreality” to others such as “godhead,”\n\n“divinity,” or “deity,” because they imply a\n\npersonal God, but “divine reality” “renders\n\nbest the author’s intention to denote a\n\nnonpersonal reality which allows for a degree\n\nof participation in its fullness while remaining\n\nthe God beyond the In-Between of\n\nexistence.”32 But, assuming that the divine\n\npresence in the metaxy is, in fact, an anonymous\n\ntheotes, rather than a particular and\n\npersonal theos, why does this mean that God\n\ncannot also reveal Himself in his personal\n\nexistence? Why is God necessarily anonymous?\n\nThe abstract noun theotes does seem to\n\nrefer to God in impersonal terms,33 but why\n\nshould that one word used only once in the\n\nentire New Testament be the pivot on which\n\nall of Christian belief must turn?34 Christians\n\nhave never believed that Christ was filled\n\nonly with an impersonal and anonymous\n\ndivine reality, although Voegelin seems to\n\nconsider this an error, for when he says that\n\n“the Unknown God whose theotes was present\n\nin the existence of Jesus has been eclipsed by\n\nthe revealed God of Christian doctrine,”35\n\nhe means that the true God of mystical\n\nphilosophy has been obscured by Christian\n\ndogma.\n\nStill, why didn’t Paul say that in Christ\n\ndwells all the fullness of God (to pleroma tou\n\ntheou)? In that particular passage he is referring\n\nto the dangers of a purely philosophical\n\n(non-metaxic) worldview, arguing that what\n\nmakes the divine what it is can be found fully\n\nonly in Christ and not in the elements (ta\n\nstoicheia) of the cosmos. He continues, “And\n\nyou, having been made full [pepleromenoi],\n\nare in Him who is the head of all rule and\n\nauthority.” That is, because Paul is emphasizing\n\nthe union between Christ and those\n\nwho believe in him, through being circumcised,\n\nburied, and raised from the dead with\n\nhim, he speaks of the dynamic source of life\n\nthat all share with Christ, which he names\n\nnot bios or zoe or theos but theotes, “divineness”\n\nor divine presence. Christ is the locus of\n\nindwelling divine “fullness” while we are the\n\n“having-been-made-fullness” of divine reality,\n\nto the limits of our own capacity,\n\nthrough an intense transforming union with\n\nChrist. In terms of Christian doctrine, we\n\nparticipate in the divine presence in Christ\n\nwho is fully God, but we are not fully God\n\nourselves.\n\nVoegelin does not interpret either the\n\nCaesarea Philippi or Colossians passage to\n\nmean that either Peter or the Evangelist\n\nbelieved that Christ was anything as static or\n\nthing-like as a hypostatic union of divine\n\nand human natures, or God and man. What\n\nhe believes these writings were attempting to\n\ncommunicate was the experience of the\n\nintensity of divine presence, since, Voegelin\n\nsaid, what we experience is a dynamic presence,\n\nnot a static “nature.” This is almost\n\ncertainly correct as far as it goes, but it\n\nignores the meaning of tradition, of the belief\n\nthat the long-term reflection on the meaning\n\nof this intense encounter with divine presence,\n\nwhich concluded that it was an encounter\n\nwith God himself, was just as divinely\n\ninspired as Scripture. After discussing\n\nthe Caesarea Philippi question in the essay\n\n“Wisdom and the Magic of the Extreme”\n\nVoegelin goes on to raise for himself the vital\n\nquestion who this person of the Christ really\n\nis. “He is neither a man, moving in the\n\nstruggle of the metaxy toward immortality,\n\nnor the divine reality beyond the metaxy.\n\nThe [pneumatic] visions see in the Christ the\n\nhistorical event of God’s pleromatic presence\n\nin a man, revealing the suffering presence of\n\nthe God in every man as the transfiguring\n\nforce that will let mortal reality rise with the\n\nGod to his immortality. The pleromatic\n\nmetaxy seen in the Christ reveals mortal\n\nsuffering as participation in the divine suffering.”\n\n36 This is in accordance with Christian\n\nbelief in the sense that Christ was not anxiously\n\nsearching for the ground of existence,\n\nnor was he merely an apparition of the\n\nunincarnated God. But it contradicts Christian\n\nbelief if it means that Christ was neither\n\nfully God nor fully man.\n\nVoegelin considers the phrase “pleromatic\n\nmetaxy” to be the most exact possible expression\n\nof Chalcedon’s textual summary, arrived\n\nat after several centuries of complex\n\nstruggle to define Christ. According to the\n\nCouncil’s definition Christ is “the same perfect\n\nin godhead [theotes], the same perfect in\n\nmanhood [anthropotes], truly God and truly\n\nman [theos alethos kai anthropos alethos], the\n\nsame of a reasonable soul and body;\n\nhomoousios with the Father in godhead\n\n[theotes], and the same homoousios with us in\n\nmanhood [anthropotes], like us in all things\n\nexcept sin; begotten before ages of the Father\n\nin godhead [theotes]…acknowledged in two\n\nnatures…the difference of the natures being\n\nby no means taken away because of the\n\nunion.”37 Despite the complexities and ambiguities\n\nof this definition, it is quite clear\n\nthat Christ is understood to be both theos and\n\nanthropos, as well as both theotes and anthropotes\n\n(human reality). This text, with its alternation\n\nbetween Christ as theos and theotes,\n\nconveys the sense of a groping to find adequate\n\nexpression for something that defies\n\nverbal formulation, since the mystery of the\n\nIncarnation is indeed, as Voegelin said, “impenetrable”\n\nby human understanding. Nonetheless,\n\ndespite its inadequacy, it does go\n\nbeyond theotes to say that Christ is “truly theos\n\nand truly anthropos,” which Voegelin interprets\n\nas an attempt to convey “the visionary\n\ntruth of the Christ’s existence in a metaxy that\n\nis distinguished from the noetic metaxy by\n\nthe pleromatic presence of divine reality.”38\n\nWhat he meant is that unlike the philosophical\n\nnoetic experience of searching for what\n\nloves to hide (to borrow from Heraclitus), the\n\nexperience of Christ is one of overwhelming\n\ndivine presence, or “unconcealedness” (to\n\nborrow from Heidegger).\n\nHere, consistent with his understanding of\n\nthe metaxy, Voegelin interprets Christ as\n\nneither fully God nor fully man, in the sense\n\nthat we normally mean by the term “man,”\n\nrather than fully both. Because He is the\n\nfullness of divine presence as it can dwell in\n\nand be perceived by consciousness within the\n\nlimits of human reality, he is more than a\n\nman, but because He is filled, according to\n\nVoegelin’s reading of Colossians, with theotes\n\nrather than theos, it is not accurate to say\n\nsimply that He is God. When Voegelin says\n\nthat Christ was not “a man, moving in the\n\nstruggle of the metaxy toward immortality”\n\nhe means that, “as far as consciousness is the\n\nsite of participation, its reality partakes of\n\nboth the divine and the human without being\n\nwholly the one or the other,”39 which would\n\nentail that Christ could not be “true God and\n\ntrue man” but rather something ineffable inbetween\n\n“mundane humanity and something\n\ntransmundane.”40 A man in this “not\n\nquite human,…not quite divine” tension is\n\nneither the “mortal man” in the Homeric\n\nsense, nor an immortal god, but “a new kind\n\nof man,” that Plato calls the daimonios aner,\n\nwhich Voegelin translates as a “spiritual\n\nman,” the man who dwells fully in the\n\nmetaxy as he is filled with divine presence.\n\nBut how much difference there is between\n\nPlato’s daimonios aner, of whom a prime\n\nexample is Socrates, and Voegelin’s Christ is\n\nnot entirely clear.\n\nVoegelin says that in John’s Gospel “there\n\nis no doctrine to be taught but only the story\n\nto be told of God’s pull becoming effective in\n\nthe world through Christ, the Saving Tale.”41\n\nChrist is the exemplar, the man transparent\n\nfor the presence of the Unknown God, a\n\nrevelation that is “in conscious continuity\n\nwith the millennial process of revelation”\n\nthat Voegelin found constituting human history.\n\n42 This God encountered in the metaxy\n\nis an unknown God whom, Voegelin believed,\n\nPlato knew “just as much as Jesus,”\n\nalthough Plato did not differentiate God in a\n\nman but instead regarded the “son of God”\n\n(or the monogenes theos) as the cosmos rather\n\nthan a human being.43 Nevertheless, Voegelin\n\ndetermined that, despite Plato’s equal knowledge\n\nof the unknown God and the noetic\n\nsuperiority of Platonic philosophy to Christianity\n\non some points, “the full differentiation\n\ncomes only through Jesus, not through\n\nPlato.”44 For Voegelin the whole point of the\n\nNew Testament is the experiential revelation\n\nof the fullness of divine presence in\n\nChrist, who is, on the whole, more pneumatically\n\nbut less noetically differentiated\n\nthan Platonic philosophy. The real mingling\n\nof divine and human is not so much in Christ\n\nas in the metaxy. Christ, as the Mediator, is\n\nthe metaxy made visible.\n\nTherefore, the drama of revelation in\n\nChrist is also the drama of history, a subject\n\nthat Voegelin often discussed. He believed,\n\nand said that Plato and Paul believed, that\n\nhistory and its meaning as the movement of\n\nconsciousness toward greater differentiation\n\nand luminosity45 are constituted by theophanic\n\nevents in the metaxy of which one of the\n\nmost important is Paul’s Vision of the Resurrected.\n\nIn other words the meaning of\n\nhistory is “transfiguring incarnation [which]\n\ndoes not begin with Christ, as Paul assumed,\n\nbut becomes conscious through Christ and\n\nPaul’s vision as the eschatological telos of the\n\ntransfiguring process that goes on in history\n\nbefore and after Christ and constitutes its\n\nmeaning.”46 Therefore, history for Voegelin\n\nis the process by which man participates\n\nmore and more fully in divine presence and\n\nbecomes, in effect, more Christ. Just as\n\nrevelation is a process in which divine reality\n\nbecomes luminous to itself in humanity, so\n\nhistory is a process in which humanity becomes\n\nthe incarnation of God, a process that\n\nbecomes conscious not in a philosopher but\n\nin Christ, although we must also draw the\n\ninference that after a period of obscurity this\n\nprocess has returned to awareness in the\n\nconsciousness of the philosopher Voegelin.\n\nTherefore, for Voegelin, what constitutes\n\nhistory and is therefore important is not the\n\nabstract question whether Christ was truly\n\nGod and truly man but the theophanic event,\n\nthe metaxic vision of divine reality in Christ\n\nthat motivated the disciples to preach the\n\nrevelation of God in Him. Hence, Voegelin\n\noften refers to “the Christ event” rather than\n\nsimply to Christ. Similarly, since the Resurrection\n\nis an essential Christian belief it\n\nshould be noted that Voegelin apparently did\n\nnot accept the actual physical resurrection of\n\nChrist, but thought of resurrection in terms\n\nof the metaxic “vision of the Resurrected.”47\n\nThe historically significant event is the vision\n\nin the metaxy, not the empty tomb in\n\nthe physical world. But what happens to\n\nChristianity if Christ is not really physically\n\nrisen from the dead, but is only “resurrected”\n\nin visions?\n\nAll of this leaves Christians with a significant\n\nproblem. We might attempt to read\n\nVoegelin as saying that the understanding of\n\nChrist as theotes but not theos, a human\n\nconsciousness living fully in the metaxy but\n\nnot actually God, is a purely philosophical\n\nexegesis of Christ, and further illumination\n\nof who he is must be left to the theologians.\n\nHowever, Voegelin has precluded this reading\n\nby his stance on dogma and theology. If\n\ntheology is merely a deformation of philosophy,\n\nwhich is the true science, then his\n\nphilosophical interpretation of Christ must\n\nbecome all of the truth of Christ that we can\n\never know. This significantly changes the\n\nChristian sense of who Christ is, for, hypothetically,\n\nif Voegelin’s understanding is the\n\naccurate one, then much of Christian belief\n\nis false. Christ is not, as the Nicene Creed has\n\nit, “deum verum de deo vero” or “consubstantialem\n\npatri,” since these are dogmatic\n\npropositions that according to Voegelin have\n\ndeteriorated into verbal formalities that have\n\nlost the original living experiences of mysterious,\n\nineffable reality. Who is he then? In\n\nVoegelin’s mind, how much difference is\n\nthere between Christ and Plato as avatars of\n\ndivine presence? If Christ was not really God\n\nbut was only a Jewish version of the daimonios\n\naner, and if the knowledge of the unknown\n\nGod is in Plato just as much as in Jesus, only\n\nless differentiated, then why should anyone\n\nbe a Christian? If William Thompson is right\n\nin saying that “Jesus’ death as that of Socrates\n\nis representative because it expresses this\n\npull” by which God “draws” the soul,48 then\n\nhow is Christ significantly more central to\n\nhistory than was Socrates? If Christ is most\n\nadequately understood as the man who lived\n\nmore intensely in the metaxy than anyone\n\nelse, then what does it mean to worship or\n\npray to Christ? If the advantage of Christianity\n\nover Platonic philosophy is only that of\n\ngreater “differentiation,” then to what degree\n\nis it better to be a Christian than a\n\nphilosopher?\n\nVoegelin’s philosophical analysis seems to\n\nundermine completely the Christian belief in\n\nthe radical uniqueness of Christ, for if He is\n\nmerely the fullness of the metaxic theotes and\n\nnot God himself, then how do we know that\n\nhe has been the only such person in history,\n\nparticularly if Plato “knew just as much?”\n\nHow do we know that other itinerant preachers\n\ndid not have the same fullness of divine\n\nreality but lacked a literate Paul and evangelists\n\nwith the necessary symbols to articulate\n\nthe experience, insight, and vision? How do\n\nwe know that there will not be future\n\n“Christs” who will have just as much theotes?\n\nWhy should Jesus be the only or the last\n\ninstance of the fullness of divine presence\n\nmanifested in a human being? Glenn Hughes\n\nin his commentary on Voegelin’s Christianity\n\nasserts that Jesus’ uniqueness is not in his\n\nconsciousness shaped by divine-human encounter\n\nand his share in divine presence, for\n\nthese are true to some degree of all human\n\nbeings, but it is rather in the fact that, for\n\nthose with the ability to experience it, “there\n\nis in him such a fullness of revelation, such a\n\nfullness of imaging-forth of the unseen, transcendent\n\ndivine reality, that it must be affirmed\n\nto be unsurpassable.”49 We must ask if\n\nhe was experienced as unsurpassable as God\n\nor as metaxic theotes.50 Christ as God is\n\nindeed unique and unsurpassable, but Christ\n\nexperienced as fullness of presence of an\n\nUnknown God is another matter. In short,\n\nChrist defined as fullness of divine presence\n\ndoes not seem as necessarily and radically\n\nunique as Christians have always believed.\n\nThe implications of this for Christianity\n\nare profound. As Eugene Webb put it, “To\n\ndigest the implications of Voegelin’s thought\n\nfor Christian theology will require the efforts\n\nof a generation of theologians, and it will\n\nhave to involve radical reconsideration of the\n\ntraditional claims of Christianity to exclusive\n\nvalidity as a religion,” something that Webb\n\nadmits would be both difficult and dangerous\n\nbecause “the question of the relative truth of\n\nvarious religions cannot be solved by giving\n\nup all doctrinal claims.”51 Some seem to think\n\nthe radical reconsideration is indeed warranted\n\nby the doctrinalization that distorted\n\nthe original meaning, such as Michael\n\nMorrissey who commented that “Voegelin\n\nchallenges Christian theology to break from\n\nits doxic conception of truth,”52 and to\n\nrecognize that the traditional identification\n\nof Jesus with God was “a development authorized\n\nby some later, enthusiastic but flawed\n\nChurch theologizing that overlooked the\n\nexplicit and implicit nuances of Nicea and\n\nChalcedon, not to mention the Gospel sources\n\nthemselves.”53 However, a theologian of the\n\nstature of Joseph Cardinal Ratzinger, while\n\nacknowledging the mysterious nature of revelation\n\nand the symbolic character of doctrine,\n\nnonetheless bluntly insists “it has always\n\nbeen a basic tenet of the Christian faith that\n\nJesus is completely God and completely man.”54\n\nIf the traditional belief in the Incarnation\n\nas the mysterious union of true divinity and\n\ntrue humanity in Christ is correct, then there\n\nmust be an error in Voegelin’s philosophy. In\n\nmy view the questionable assumption that\n\nVoegelin makes is that regarding knowledge\n\nof God we are limited to symbols that articulate\n\nthe experience of consciousness in the\n\n“In-Between” and that God cannot or does\n\nnot communicate anything to us about what\n\nhe is in himself, beyond the metaxy. The\n\nNicaean and Chalcedonian formulations of\n\ndoctrine grew out of centuries of struggling\n\nto refine and clarify what the Scriptural\n\naccounts of Christ were telling us and to\n\nreject false or inadequate interpretations.\n\nThe similarity or even continuity between\n\nphilosophy and Christianity does not necessarily\n\nmean that Christ is Socrates raised to a\n\nhigher power but rather that philosophy\n\ngrasped the nature of human participation in\n\nmetaxic divine reality without being able to\n\nforesee that the ultimate gift of God would be\n\nto cross over the metaxy and actually become\n\nman. The substance of Christianity, after all,\n\nis not the metaxy but the Incarnation, and\n\nwhile Voegelin’s thought can certainly enrich\n\nChristianity, its interpretation of the\n\nIncarnation as the metaxy excludes much\n\nthat is vitally important in traditional Christian\n\ntheology. Consider, for example, the\n\nfollowing theological statement of Christian\n\nbelief that opens a book by a contemporary\n\ntheologian: “The Christian doctrine of God\n\nis to be understood from within the unique,\n\ndefinitive, and final self-revelation of God in\n\nJesus Christ his only-begotten Son, that is,\n\nfrom within the self-revelation of God as\n\nGod become man for us and our\n\nsalvation….[and] it is in the Lord Jesus, the\n\nvery Word and Mind of God incarnate in\n\nour humanity, that the eternal God ‘defines’\n\nand identifies himself for us as he really is.\n\nOnly in Christ is God’s self-revelation identical\n\nwith himself, and only in Christ, God for\n\nus, does he communicate his self-revelation\n\nto us in such a way that authentic knowledge\n\nof God is embodied in our humanity….”55\n\nFor all of the welcome richness and profundity\n\nof Voegelin’s philosophy, and for all that\n\nthe metaxy has added to our understanding\n\nof the depths of consciousness, I believe there\n\nare far greater depths of wisdom and mystery\n\nhere that are simply invisible within the\n\nrange of the spectrum of truth to which\n\nVoegelin’s philosophical assumptions restrict\n\nhim.\n\nNOTES\n\nEric Voegelin, “Immortality: Experience and Symbol,”\n\nThe Collected Works of Eric Voegelin, [CW] Vol. 12:\n\nPublished Essays 1966-1985, ed.

Voegelin\n\nmakes this statement with reference to the belief of\n\nAquinas that the Christ is “the head of the corpus mysticum\n\nthat embraces, not only Christians, but all mankind from\n\nthe creation of the world to its end.”\n\nAlthough this\n\nemphasis on flux would seem to put him in the Heraclitean\n\ncamp, I believe a more apt modern comparison is with\n\nBergson, who argued that the inner, metaphysical,\n\nabsolute reality is not Being but becoming, flowing,\n\ntime, and change that can be known only intuitively. .It\n\nwas Bergson’s belief that the static, “scientific” concepts\n\nof ordinary language are the artifacts of an intellect that\n\nmust analyze and use the world in order to survive, but\n\nall such concepts artificially stop the vital motion so that\n\nwe might surround ourselves with a world of “things”\n\nthat have constant and reliable properties that we find of\n\nuse. To grasp reality, the constant flow, Bergson thought\n\nmetaphysics “must transcend concepts to reach intuition”\n\nthat could be expressed only in “supple, mobile,\n\nand almost fluid representations” that are “always ready\n\nto mold themselves on the fleeting forms of intuition”\n\nto convey the reality of constant change and are very close\n\nto what Voegelin meant by symbols.

Voegelin frequently\n\ncommented that the concepts that we use in propositions\n\nare inadequate to express the flux of reality because they\n\nwere developed to deal with the material realm in which\n\nwe must engage in practical action to preserve our\n\nphysical existence.\n\n“The Gospel and Culture,” 176.\n\nEric Voegelin, Anamnesis, tr. and ed. by Gerhart\n\nNiemeyer (Notre Dame: University of Notre Dame\n\nPress, 1978), 133.\n\nFor an eloquent account of this\n\nmetaxic experience, see Voegelin’s description of the\n\nuncertainty of Christianity in The New Science of Politics,\n\n122.\n\nPhilosophy is characteristically noetic, while\n\nScripture and visionary sources are predominantly pneumatic.\n\nIbid., 184. The metaxy has been well described\n\nas the psyche’s searching, uncertainty, and hope in The\n\nCloud of Unknowing, a classic mystical work that Voegelin\n\nfrequently mentioned as an example of his own approach\n\nto philosophy. The anonymous author speaks of God’s\n\ngrace arousing the soul to enthusiasm and ultimately joy\n\nwhile bringing it to a deep experience of himself, but the\n\nsoul must be willing to enter the darkness of “unknowing”\n\nwith only “a naked intent toward God.” This\n\nmeditative consciousness that is acutely experienced\n\nbetween the “cloud of forgetfulness” of everything in the\n\nworld and the “cloud of unknowing” that obscures the\n\nvision of God is the metaxy.

Voegelin includes in these\n\npneumatic visions not only those of disciples such as St.\n\nPaul but also visions attributed to Christ himself, such as\n\nin Matt. 3: 16-17.\n\nThe English is from Pelikan, 263-\n\n264.\n\nIbid., 370.\n\n“Immortality: Experience and\n\nSymbol,” 90.\n\n“Conversations,” 250.\n\n“The Gospel\n\nand Culture,” 190.\n\nIbid., 198.\n\nThe Gospel of John\n\nuses the word monogenes, usually translated as “onlybegotten”\n\nto refer to Christ, such as in 3:16.\n\n“Conversations,”\n\n281.\n\nEric Voegelin, Order and History,\n\nVol. IV, The Ecumenic Age, (Baton Rouge: Louisiana State\n\nUniversity Press, 1974), 242.\n\nIbid., 270.\n\nOne of\n\nNiemeyer’s criticisms of Voegelin is “the elimination of\n\nthe Resurrection by reducing the resurrection experiences\n\nof the disciples to the type of Paul’s vision.” Gerhart\n\nNiemeyer, “Faith and Reason in Eric Voegelin,” Within\n\nand Above Ourselves, 123.\n\nWilliam M. Thompson,\n\n“Voegelin on Jesus Christ,” Voegelin and the Theologian:\n\nTen Studies in Interpretation, ed. by John Kirby and\n\nWilliam M. Thompson. (Toronto Studies in Theology,\n\nVol. 10. New York: The Edwin Mellen Press, 1983), 183.\n\nHughes, 28.\n\nAs James Rhodes comments on the\n\nposition of Gerhart Niemeyer, “he is challenging\n\nVoegelin on his own terms, contending that Jesus was\n\nexperienced as the ‘only begotten Son’, not as the most\n\nperfect of many Sons.” James Rhodes, “Voegelin and\n\nChristian Faith,” Center Journal, Vol. 2, No. 3 (Summer\n\n1983), 91.\n\nEugene Webb, “Faith, Truth, and Persuasion\n\nin the Thought of Eric Voegelin,” Voegelin and the\n\nTheologian, 366.\n\nMichael Morrissey, Consciousness and\n\nTranscendence: The Theology of Eric Voegelin (Notre Dame:\n\nThe University of Notre Dame Press, 1994), 249.\n\nMorrissey’s book contains an excellent analysis of\n\nVoegelin’s Christology with which I essentially agree,\n\nalthough I have serious reservations about his advocacy\n\nof creating a Voegelinian Christian theology (p. 249)\n\nbecause while I agree that “faith is not rooted in assent to\n\ndogmatic propositions” and that a Voegelinian Christian\n\ntheology might well be in some sense a “more liberating,\n\npersonal, and universal conception” of faith, such a\n\ntheology would not quite be Christianity.\n\nIbid., 242.\n\nJoseph Cardinal Ratzinger, Introduction to Christianity,\n\ntr. J. R. Foster (San Francisco: Ignatius Press, 1990),\n\n208. Ratzinger does hold some views about Christ that\n\nare not far from those of Voegelin, such as “Christian faith\n\nbelieves in Jesus as the exemplary man” (which he\n\nbelieves is the best way to translate the Pauline concept\n\nof the “last Adam”). “But precisely because he is the\n\nexemplary, the authoritative man, he oversteps the\n\nbounds of humanity; only thus and only thereby is he\n\nthe truly exemplary man,” and “Jesus Christ is…the man\n\nwho has truly come to himself.” “That man is most man,\n\nindeed the true man, who is most unlimited, who not\n\nonly has contact with the infinite—the infinite being!—\n\nbut is one with him: Jesus Christ. In him ‘hominization’\n\nhas truly reached its goal.” 175-76. Still, Ratzinger insists\n\non the traditional doctrine that Jesus Christ is God and\n\nman, not simply a man filled with divine presence.\n\nThomas F.
