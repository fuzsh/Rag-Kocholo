Reaction forces and moments created by a mesh and cable network are estimated using CASA. Deployment analysis is carried out using DADS. Three types of deployable antenna modules are developed and fabricated. Their design approach and deployment characteristics are also presented. Ground deployment tests are performed to verify design criteria.\n\nStructural design and static analysis of a double-ring deployable truss for mesh antennas\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nXu, Yan; Guan, Fuling; Chen, Jianjun; Zheng, Yao\n\n2012-12-01\n\nThis paper addresses the structural design, the deployment control design, the static analysis and the model testing of a new double-ring deployable truss that is intended for large mesh antennas. This deployable truss is a multi-DOF (degree-of-freedom), over-constrained mechanism. Two kinds of deployable basic elements were introduced, as well as a process to synthesise the structure of the deployable truss. The geometric equations were formulated to determine the length of each strut, including the effects of the joint size. A DOF evaluation showed that the mechanism requires two active cables and requires deployment control. An open-loop control system was designed to control the rotational velocities of two motors. The structural stiffness of the truss was assessed by static analysis that considered the effects of the constraint condition and the pre-stress of the passive cables. A 4.2-metre demonstration model of an antenna was designed and fabricated. The geometry and the deployment behaviour of the double-ring truss were validated by the experiments using this model.\n\nDynamic analysis of the deployment for mesh reflector deployable antennas with the cable-net structure\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nZhang, Yiqun; Li, Na; Yang, Guigeng; Ru, Wenrui\n\n2017-02-01\n\nThis paper presents a dynamic analysis approach for the composite structure of a deployable truss and cable-net system. An Elastic Catenary Element is adopted to model the slack/tensioned cables. Then, from the energy standpoint, the kinetic energy, elasticity-potential energy and geopotential energy of the cable-net structure and deployable truss are derived. Thus, the flexible multi-body dynamic model of the deployable antenna is built based on the Lagrange equation. The effect of the cable-net tension on the antenna truss is discussed and compared with previous publications and a dynamic deployment analysis is performed. Both the simulation and experimental results verify the validity of the method presented.\n\nHybrid Deployable Foam Antennas and Reflectors\n\nNASA Technical Reports Server (NTRS)\n\nRivellini, Tommaso; Willis, Paul; Hodges, Richard; Spitz, Suzanne\n\n2006-01-01\n\nHybrid deployable radio antennas and reflectors of a proposed type would feature rigid narrower apertures plus wider adjoining apertures comprising reflective surfaces supported by open-cell polymeric foam structures (see figure). The open-cell foam structure of such an antenna would be compressed for compact stowage during transport. To initiate deployment of the antenna, the foam structure would simply be released from its stowage mechanical restraint. The elasticity of the foam would drive the expansion of the foam structure to its full size and shape. There are several alternatives for fabricating a reflective surface supported by a polymeric foam structure. One approach would be to coat the foam with a metal. Another approach would be to attach a metal film or a metal-coated polymeric membrane to the foam. Yet another approach would be to attach a metal mesh to the foam. The hybrid antenna design and deployment concept as proposed offers significant advantages over other concepts for deployable antennas: 1) In the unlikely event of failure to deploy, the rigid narrow portion of the antenna would still function, providing a minimum level of assured performance. In contrast, most other concepts for deploying a large antenna from compact stowage are of an \"all or nothing\" nature: the antenna is not useful at all until and unless it is fully deployed. 2) Stowage and deployment would not depend on complex mechanisms or actuators, nor would it involve the use of inflatable structures. Therefore, relative to antennas deployed by use of mechanisms, actuators, or inflation systems, this antenna could be lighter, cheaper, amenable to stowage in a smaller volume, and more reliable. An open-cell polymeric (e.g., polyurethane) foam offers several advantages for use as a compressible/expandable structural material to support a large antenna or reflector aperture. A few of these advantages are the following: 3) The open cellular structure is amenable to compression to a very\n\nDeployable antenna\n\nNASA Technical Reports Server (NTRS)\n\nFink, Patrick W.

C. G.\n\nMobile services via satellite in the 800-900 MHz frequency range have recently been studied by SPAR Aerospace Ltd in the M-SAT phase B using various unfurlable offset reflector concepts between 9 and 5 m aperture diameters for 6-, 4- and 2-beam coverage. For a 2-beam coverage of Canada and U.S.A. two offset antennas each of 5 m aperture diameter are required. The MBB offset unfurlable mesh antenna (UMA) developed since 1983 under an ESA contract is one of the attractive candidates: The design concept chosen uses foldable radial ribs of carbon fibre which deploy a gold plated molybdenum mesh on adjustable stand-offs. This concept is applicable for offset aperture diameters up to 12 m since the carbon fibre ribs are double folded and provide for a high package density when stowed at the spacecraft during launch. The electrical analysis performed by TICRA/Copenhagen was assisted by electrical measurements on mesh samples, verifying that main charactertics as ohmic resistance, transmission loss and passive intermodulation products (PIMP) lie within the required tolerances if the mesh is pretensioned to a certain configuration. For on-orbit testing and retrieval by the Shuttle the reflector shows a unique design feature of retractability by the reversable deployment sequence.\n\nSpaceborne Microwave Instrument for High Resolution Remote Sensing of the Earth's Surface Using a Large-Aperture Mesh Antenna\n\nNASA Technical Reports Server (NTRS)\n\nNjoku, E.; Wilson, W.; Yueh, S.; Freeland, R.; Helms, R.; Edelstein, W.; Sadowy, G.; Farra, D.; West, R.; Oxnevad, K.\n\n2001-01-01\n\nThis report describes a two-year study of a large-aperture, lightweight, deployable mesh antenna system for radiometer and radar remote sensing of the Earth from space. The study focused specifically on an instrument to measure ocean salinity and Soil moisture. Measurements of ocean salinity and soil moisture are of critical . importance in improving knowledge and prediction of key ocean and land surface processes, but are not currently obtainable from space. A mission using this instrument would be the first demonstration of deployable mesh antenna technology for remote sensing and could lead to potential applications in other remote sensing disciplines that require high spatial resolution measurements. The study concept features a rotating 6-m-diameter deployable mesh antenna, with radiometer and radar sensors, to measure microwave emission and backscatter from the Earth's surface. The sensors operate at L and S bands, with multiple polarizations and a constant look angle, scanning across a wide swath. The study included detailed analyses of science requirements, reflector and feedhorn design and performance, microwave emissivity measurements of mesh samples, design and test of lightweight radar electronic., launch vehicle accommodations, rotational dynamics simulations, and an analysis of attitude control issues associated with the antenna and spacecraft, The goal of the study was to advance the technology readiness of the overall concept to a level appropriate for an Earth science emission.\n\nDeployable antenna kinematics using tensegrity structure design\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nKnight, Byron Franklin\n\nWith vast changes in spacecraft development over the last decade, a new, cheaper approach was needed for deployable kinematic systems such as parabolic antenna reflectors. Historically, these mesh-surface reflectors have resembled folded umbrellas, with incremental redesigns utilized to save packaging size. These systems are typically over-constrained designs, the assumption being that high reliability necessary for space operations requires this level of conservatism. But with the rapid commercialization of space, smaller launch platforms and satellite buses have demanded much higher efficiency from all space equipment than can be achieved through this incremental approach. This work applies an approach called tensegrity to deployable antenna development. Kenneth Snelson, a student of R. Buckminster Fuller, invented Tensegrity structures in 1948. Such structures use a minimum number of compression members (struts); stability is maintain using tension members (ties). The novelty introduced in this work is that the ties are elastic, allowing the struts to extend or contract, and in this way changing the surface of the antenna. Previously, the University of Florida developed an approach to quantify the stability and motion of parallel manipulators. This approach was applied to deployable, tensegrity, antenna structures. Based on the kinematic analyses for the 3-3 (octahedron) and 4-4 (square anti-prism) structures, the 6-6 (hexagonal anti-prism) analysis was completed which establishes usable structural parameters. The primary objective for this work was to prove the stability of this class of deployable structures, and their potential application to space structures. The secondary objective is to define special motions for tensegrity antennas, to meet the subsystem design requirements, such as addressing multiple antenna-feed locations. This work combines the historical experiences of the artist (Snelson), the mathematician (Ball), and the space systems engineer\n\nDeployable antenna phase A study\n\nNASA Technical Reports Server (NTRS)\n\nSchultz, J.; Bernstein, J.; Fischer, G.; Jacobson, G.; Kadar, I.; Marshall, R.; Pflugel, G.; Valentine, J.\n\n1979-01-01\n\nApplications for large deployable antennas were re-examined, flight demonstration objectives were defined, the flight article (antenna) was preliminarily designed, and the flight program and ground development program, including the support equipment, were defined for a proposed space transportation system flight experiment to demonstrate a large (50 to 200 meter) deployable antenna system. Tasks described include: (1) performance requirements analysis; (2) system design and definition; (3) orbital operations analysis; and (4) programmatic analysis.\n\nMembrane Shell Reflector Segment Antenna\n\nNASA Technical Reports Server (NTRS)\n\nFang, Houfei; Im, Eastwood; Lin, John; Moore, James\n\n2012-01-01\n\nThe mesh reflector is the only type of large, in-space deployable antenna that has successfully flown in space. However, state-of-the-art large deployable mesh antenna systems are RF-frequency-limited by both global shape accuracy and local surface quality. The limitations of mesh reflectors stem from two factors. First, at higher frequencies, the porosity and surface roughness of the mesh results in loss and scattering of the signal. Second, the mesh material does not have any bending stiffness and thus cannot be formed into true parabolic (or other desired) shapes. To advance the deployable reflector technology at high RF frequencies from the current state-of-the-art, significant improvements need to be made in three major aspects: a high-stability and highprecision deployable truss; a continuously curved RF reflecting surface (the function of the surface as well as its first derivative are both continuous); and the RF reflecting surface should be made of a continuous material. To meet these three requirements, the Membrane Shell Reflector Segment (MSRS) antenna was developed.\n\nBeam-Steerable Flat-Panel Reflector Antenna\n\nNASA Technical Reports Server (NTRS)\n\nLee, Choon Sae; Lee, Chanam; Miranda, Felix A.\n\n2005-01-01\n\nMany space applications require a high-gain antenna that can be easily deployable in space. Currently, the most common high-gain antenna for space-born applications is an umbrella-type reflector antenna that can be folded while being lifted to the Earth orbit. There have been a number of issues to be resolved for this type of antenna. The reflecting surface of a fine wire mesh has to be light in weight and flexible while opening up once in orbit. Also the mesh must be a good conductor at the operating frequency. In this paper, we propose a different type of high-gain antenna for easy space deployment. The proposed antenna is similar to reflector antennas except the curved main reflector is replaced by a flat reconfigurable surface for easy packing and deployment in space. Moreover it is possible to steer the beam without moving the entire antenna system.\n\nFeasibility of Very Large Sparse Aperture Deployable Antennas\n\nDTIC Science & Technology\n\n2014-03-27\n\nFEASIBILITY OF VERY LARGE SPARSE APERTURE DEPLOYABLE ANTENNAS THESIS Jason C.

Heller, B.S., Aerospace\n\nThe Galileo high gain antenna deployment anomaly\n\nNASA Technical Reports Server (NTRS)\n\nJohnson, Michael R.\n\n1994-01-01\n\nOn April 11, 1991, the Galileo spacecraft executed a sequence that would open the spacecraft's High Gain Antenna. The Antenna's launch restraint had been released just after deployment sequence, the antenna, which opens like an umbrella, never reached the fully deployed position. The analyses and tests that followed allowed a conclusive determination of the likely failure mechanisms and pointed to some strategies to use for recovery of the high gain antenna.\n\nCable-catenary large antenna concept\n\nNASA Technical Reports Server (NTRS)\n\nAkle, W.\n\n1985-01-01\n\nDeployable to very large diameters (over 1000 ft), while still remaining compatible with a complete satellite system launch by STS, the cable-catenary antenna comprises: 8 radial deployable boom masts; a deployable hub and feed support center mast; balanced front and back, radial and circumferential catenary cabling for highly accurate (mm) surface control; no interfering cabling in the antenna field; and an RF reflecting mesh supported on the front catenaries. Illustrations show the antenna-satellite system deployed and stowed configurations; the antenna deployment sequence; the design analysis logic; the sizing analysis output, and typical parametric design data.\n\nMechanically scanned deployable antenna study\n\nNASA Technical Reports Server (NTRS)\n\n1983-01-01\n\nThe conceptual design of a Mechanically Scanned Deployable Antenna which is launched by the STS (Space Shuttle) to provide radiometric brightness temperature maps of the Earth and oceans at selected frequency bands in the frequency range of 1.4 GHz to 11 GHz is presented. Unlike previous scanning radiometric systems, multiple radiometers for each frequency are required in order to fill in the resolution cells across the swath created by the 15 meter diameter spin stabilized system. This multiple beam radiometric system is sometimes designated as a \"\"whiskbroom'' system in that it combines the techniques of the scanning and \"\"pushbroom'' type systems. The definition of the feed system including possible feed elements and location, determination of the fundamental reflector feed offset geometry including offset angles and f/D ratio, preliminary estimates of the beam efficiency of the feed reflector system, a summary of reflector mesh losses at the proposed radiometric frequency bands, an overall conceptual configuration design and preliminary structural and thermal analyses are included.\n\nUnfurlable satellite antennas - A review\n\nNASA Technical Reports Server (NTRS)\n\nRoederer, Antoine G.; Rahmat-Samii, Yahia\n\n1989-01-01\n\nA review of unfurlable satellite antennas is presented. Typical application requirements for future space missions are first outlined. Then, U.S. and European mesh and inflatable antenna concepts are described. Precision deployables using rigid panels or petals are not included in the survey. RF modeling and performance analysis of gored or faceted mesh reflector antennas are then reviewed. Finally, both on-ground and in-orbit RF test techniques for large unfurlable antennas are discussed.\n\nGPS Attitude Determination Using Deployable-Mounted Antennas\n\nNASA Technical Reports Server (NTRS)\n\nOsborne, Michael L.; Tolson, Robert H.\n\n1996-01-01\n\nThe primary objective of this investigation is to develop a method to solve for spacecraft attitude in the presence of potential incomplete antenna deployment. Most research on the use of the Global Positioning System (GPS) in attitude determination has assumed that the antenna baselines are known to less than 5 centimeters, or one quarter of the GPS signal wavelength. However, if the GPS antennas are mounted on a deployable fixture such as a solar panel, the actual antenna positions will not necessarily be within 5 cm of nominal. Incomplete antenna deployment could cause the baselines to be grossly in error, perhaps by as much as a meter. Overcoming this large uncertainty in order to accurately determine attitude is the focus of this study. To this end, a two-step solution method is proposed. The first step uses a least-squares estimate of the baselines to geometrically calculate the deployment angle errors of the solar panels. For the spacecraft under investigation, the first step determines the baselines to 3-4 cm with 4-8 minutes of data. A Kalman filter is then used to complete the attitude determination process, resulting in typical attitude errors of 0.50.\n\nNew Antenna Deployment, Pointing and Supporting Mechanism\n\nNASA Technical Reports Server (NTRS)\n\nCostabile, V.; Lumaca, F.; Marsili, P.; Noni, G.; Portelli, C.\n\n1996-01-01\n\nOn ITALSAT Flight 2, the Italian telecommunications satellite, the two L-Ka antennas (Tx and Rx) use two large deployable reflectors (2000-mm diameter), whose deployment and fine pointing functions are accomplished by means of an innovative mechanism concept. The Antenna Deployment & Pointing Mechanism and Supporting Structure (ADPMSS) is based on a new configuration solution, where the reflector and mechanisms are conceived as an integrated, self-contained assembly. This approach is different from the traditional configuration solution. Typically, a rigid arm is used to deploy and then support the reflector in the operating position, and an Antenna Pointing Mechanism (APM) is normally interposed between the reflector and the arm for steering operation. The main characteristics of the ADPMSS are: combined implementation of deployment, pointing, and reflector support; optimum integration of active components and interface matching with the satellite platform; structural link distribution to avoid hyperstatic connections; very light weight and; high performance in terms of deployment torque margin and pointing range/accuracy. After having successfully been subjected to all component-level qualification and system-level acceptance tests, two flight ADPMSS mechanisms (one for each antenna) are now integrated on ITALSAT F2 and are ready for launch. This paper deals with the design concept, development, and testing program performed to qualify the ADPMSS mechanism.\n\nDiffraction Analysis of Antennas With Mesh Surfaces\n\nNASA Technical Reports Server (NTRS)\n\nRahmat-Samii, Yahya\n\n1987-01-01\n\nStrip-aperture model replaces wire-grid model. Far-field radiation pattern of antenna with mesh reflector calculated more accurately with new strip-aperture model than with wire-grid model of reflector surface. More adaptable than wire-grid model to variety of practical configurations and decidedly superior for reflectors in which mesh-cell width exceeds mesh thickness. Satisfies reciprocity theorem. Applied where mesh cells are no larger than tenth of wavelength. Small cell size permits use of simplifying approximation that reflector-surface current induced by electromagnetic field is present even in apertures. Approximation useful in calculating far field.\n\nReview of Large Spacecraft Deployable Membrane Antenna Structures\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nLiu, Zhi-Quan; Qiu, Hui; Li, Xiao; Yang, Shu-Li\n\n2017-11-01\n\nThe demand for large antennas in future space missions has increasingly stimulated the development of deployable membrane antenna structures owing to their light weight and small stowage volume. However, there is little literature providing a comprehensive review and comparison of different membrane antenna structures. Space-borne membrane antenna structures are mainly classified as either parabolic or planar membrane antenna structures. For parabolic membrane antenna structures, there are five deploying and forming methods, including inflation, inflation-rigidization, elastic ribs driven, Shape Memory Polymer (SMP)-inflation, and electrostatic forming. The development and detailed comparison of these five methods are presented. Then, properties of membrane materials (including polyester film and polyimide film) for parabolic membrane antennas are compared. Additionally, for planar membrane antenna structures, frame shapes have changed from circular to rectangular, and different tensioning systems have emerged successively, including single Miura-Natori, double, and multi-layer tensioning systems. Recent advances in structural configurations, tensioning system design, and dynamic analysis for planar membrane antenna structures are investigated. Finally, future trends for large space membrane antenna structures are pointed out and technical problems are proposed, including design and analysis of membrane structures, materials and processes, membrane packing, surface accuracy stability, and test and verification technology. Through a review of large deployable membrane antenna structures, guidance for space membrane-antenna research and applications is provided.\n\nLightweight 3.66-meter-diameter conical mesh antenna reflector\n\nNASA Technical Reports Server (NTRS)\n\nMoore, D. M.\n\n1974-01-01\n\nA description is given of a 3.66 m diameter nonfurlable conical mesh antenna incorporating the line source feed principle recently developed. The weight of the mesh reflector and its support structure is 162 N. An area weighted RMS surface deviation of 0.28 mm was obtained. The RF performance measurements show a gain of 48.3 db at 8.448 GHz corresponding to an efficiency of 66%. During the design and development of this antenna, the technology for fabricating the large conical membranes of knitted mesh was developed. As part of this technology a FORTRAN computer program, COMESH, was developed which permits the user to predict the surface accuracy of a stretched conical membrane.\n\nDevelopment of distortion measurement system for large deployable antenna via photogrammetry in vacuum and cryogenic environment\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nZhang, Pengsong; Jiang, Shanping; Yang, Linhua; Zhang, Bolun\n\n2018-01-01\n\nIn order to meet the requirement of high precision thermal distortion measurement foraÎ¦4.2m deployable mesh antenna of satellite in vacuum and cryogenic environment, based on Digital Close-range Photogrammetry and Space Environment Test Technology of Spacecraft, a large scale antenna distortion measurement system under vacuum and cryogenic environment is developed in this paper. The antenna Distortion measurement system (ADMS) is the first domestic independently developed thermal distortion measurement system for large antenna, which has successfully solved non-contact high precision distortion measurement problem in large spacecraft structure under vacuum and cryogenic environment. The measurement accuracy of ADMS is better than 50 Î¼m/5m, which has reached international advanced level. The experimental results show that the measurement system has great advantages in large structural measurement of spacecrafts, and also has broad application prospects in space or other related fields.\n\nA Novel Approach for a Low-Cost Deployable Antenna\n\nNASA Technical Reports Server (NTRS)\n\nAmend, Chris; Nurnberger, Michael; Oppenheimer, Paul; Koss, Steve; Purdy, Bill\n\n2010-01-01\n\nThe Naval Research Laboratory (NRL) has designed, built, and fully qualified a low cost, low Passive Intermodulation (PIM) 12-foot (3.66-m) diameter deployable ultra high frequency (UHF) antenna for the Tacsat-4 program. The design utilized novel approaches in reflector material and capacitive coupling techniques. This paper discusses major design trades, unique design characteristics, and lessons learned from the development of the Tacsat 4 deployable antenna. This antenna development was sponsored by the Office of Naval Research.\n\nAntenna Technology Shuttle Experiment (ATSE)\n\nNASA Technical Reports Server (NTRS)\n\nFreeland, R. E.; Mettler, E.; Miller, L. J.; Rahmet-Samii, Y.; Weber, W. J., III\n\n1987-01-01\n\nNumerous space applications of the future will require mesh deployable antennas of 15 m in diameter or greater for frequencies up to 20 GHz. These applications include mobile communications satellites, orbiting very long baseline interferometry (VLBI) astrophysics missions, and Earth remote sensing missions. A Lockheed wrap rip antennas was used as the test article. The experiments covered a broad range of structural, control, and RF discipline objectives, which is fulfilled in total, would greatly reduce the risk of employing these antenna systems in future space applications. It was concluded that a flight experiment of a relatively large mesh deployable reflector is achievable with no major technological or cost drivers. The test articles and the instrumentation are all within the state of the art and in most cases rely on proven flight hardware. Every effort was made to design the experiments for low cost.\n\nSpace Qualification Testing of a Shape Memory Alloy Deployable CubeSat Antenna\n\nDTIC Science & Technology\n\n2016-09-15\n\nthe SMA deployment in the space environment.

A.; Lazio, T. W.; Jones, D. L.; Kasper, J. C.; Burns, J. O.; Stewart, K. P.; Weiler, K. W.\n\n2012-05-01\n\nA first step in the development of a large radio observatory on the moon for cosmological or other astrophysical and planetary goals is to deploy a few antennas as a pathfinder mission. In this presentation, we describe a mechanism being developed to deploy such antennas from a small craft, such as a Google Lunar X-prize lander. The antenna concept is to deposit antennas and leads on a polyimide film, such as Kapton, and to unroll the film on the lunar surface. The deployment technique utilized is to launch an anchor which pulls a double line from a reel at the spacecraft. Subsequently, the anchor is set by catching on the surface or collecting sufficient regolith. A motor then pulls in one end of the line, pulling the film off of its roller onto the lunar surface. Detection of a low frequency cutoff of the galactic radio background or of solar radio bursts by such a system would determine the maximum lunar ionospheric density at the time of measurement. The current design and testing, including videos of the deployment, will be presented. These activities are funded in part by the NASA Lunar Science Institute as an activity of the Lunar University Network for Astrophysical Research (LUNAR) consortium.

However the drawback of integrate stiffness is still a main problem for solid surface reflectors in the former research. To figure out this problem, a New Petal-type Deployable Solid Surface Antenna (NPDSSA) is developed in this study. A kind of drag springs are applied as linkages with adjacent petals to improve the integrate rigidity. The structural design is introduced and the geometric parameters are analyzed to find their effects on the rotation and package capacities. The software simulations and laboratory model tests are conducted to verify the deploying process of NPDSSA. Two models are employed to study the property of linkage butts and drag springs. It is indicated that model NPDSSA with the application of linkage butts and drag springs has better integrality and stability during the deploying. Finally it is concluded that NPDSSA is feasible for space applications.\n\nA Nonlinear Dynamic Model and Free Vibration Analysis of Deployable Mesh Reflectors\n\nNASA Technical Reports Server (NTRS)\n\nShi, H.; Yang, B.; Thomson, M.; Fang, H.\n\n2011-01-01\n\nThis paper presents a dynamic model of deployable mesh reflectors, in which geometric and material nonlinearities of such a space structure are fully described. Then, by linearization around an equilibrium configuration of the reflector structure, a linearized model is obtained. With this linearized model, the natural frequencies and mode shapes of a reflector can be computed. The nonlinear dynamic model of deployable mesh reflectors is verified by using commercial finite element software in numerical simulation. As shall be seen, the proposed nonlinear model is useful for shape (surface) control of deployable mesh reflectors under thermal loads.\n\nIn-Space Deployable Reflectarray Antenna: Current and Future\n\nNASA Technical Reports Server (NTRS)\n\nFang, Houfei; Knarr, Kevin; Quijano, Ubaldo; Huang, John; Thomson, Mark\n\n2008-01-01\n\nTechnologies associated with a 10-m X/Ka-band dual-frequency reflectarray antenna have been developed for deep space communication applications. The first task is the development of a 3-m diameter X/Ka dual frequency reflectarray which serves as a stepping-stone to the 10-m aperture antenna. The second task is to develop a deployable frame.\n\nInnovative Escapement-Based Mechanism for Micro-Antenna Boom Deployment\n\nNASA Technical Reports Server (NTRS)\n\nTokarz, Marta; Grygorczuk, Jerzy; Jarzynka, Stanislaw; Gut, Henryk\n\n2014-01-01\n\nThis paper presents the prototype of a tubular boom antenna developed for the Polish BRITE-PL satellite by the Space Research Center of the Polish Academy of Sciences (CBK PAN). What is unique about our work is that we developed an original type of the tubular boom antenna deployment mechanism that can be used widely as a basic solution for compact electrical antennas, booms deploying sensitive instruments, ultra-light planetary manipulators etc. The invented electromagnetic driving unit provides a dual complementary action - it adds extra energy to the driving spring, making the system more reliable, and at the same time it moderates the deployment speed acting as a kind of damper. That distinguishing feature predetermines the mechanism to be applied wherever the dynamic nature of a spring drive introducing dangerous vibrations and inducing severe local stress in the structure needs to be mitigated. Moreover, the paper reveals a product unique in Europe - a miniature beryllium bronze tubular boom free of geometry and strain defects, which is essential for stiffness and fatigue resistance. Both the deployment mechanism and the technology of tubular boom manufacturing are protected by patent rights.\n\nMechanism for Deploying a Long, Thin-Film Antenna from a Rover\n\nNASA Technical Reports Server (NTRS)\n\nLazio, Joseph; Matthews, B.; Nesnas, Issa A.; Zarzhitsky, Dimitri\n\n2013-01-01\n\nObservations with radio telescopes address key problems in cosmology, astrobiology, heliophysics, and planetary science including the first light in the Universe (Cosmic Dawn), magnetic fields of extrasolar planets, particle acceleration mechanisms, and the lunar ionosphere. The Moon is a unique science platform because it allows access to radio frequencies that do not penetrate the Earth's ionosphere and because its far side is shielded from intense terrestrial emissions. A radio antenna can be realized by using polyimide film as a substrate, with a conducting substance deposited on it. Such an antenna can be rolled into a small volume for transport, then deployed by unrolling, and a robotic rover offers a natural means of unrolling a polyimide film-based antenna. An antenna deployment mechanism was developed that allows a thin film to be deposited onto a ground surface, in a controlled manner, using a minimally actuated rover. The deployment mechanism consists of two rollers, one driven and one passive. The antenna film is wrapped around the driven roller. The passive roller is mounted on linear bearings that allow it to move radially with respect to the driven roller. Springs preload the passive roller against the driven roller, and prevent the tightly wrapped film from unspooling or \"bird's nesting\" on the driven spool. The antenna deployment mechanism is integrated on the minimally-actuated Axel rover. Axel is a two-wheeled rover platform with a trailing boom that is capable of traversing undulated terrain and overcoming obstacles of a wheel radius in height. It is operated by four motors: one that drives each wheel; a third that controls the rotation of the boom, which orients the body mounted sensors; and a fourth that controls the rover's spool to drive the antenna roller. This low-mass axle-like rover houses its control and communication avionics inside its cylindrical body. The Axel rover teleoperation software has an auto-spooling mode that allows a user\n\nA technology development program for large space antennas\n\nNASA Technical Reports Server (NTRS)\n\nRussell, R. A.; Campbell, T. G.; Freeland, R. E.\n\n1980-01-01\n\nThe design and application of the offset wrap rib and the maypole (hoop/column) antenna configurations are described. The NASA mission model that generically categorizes the classes of user requirements, as well as the methods used to determine critical technologies and requirements are discussed. Performance estimates for the mesh deployable antenna selected for development are presented.\n\nCHEM-Based Self-Deploying Spacecraft Radar Antennas\n\nNASA Technical Reports Server (NTRS)\n\nSokolowski, Witold; Huang, John; Ghaffarian, Reza\n\n2004-01-01\n\nA document proposes self-deploying spacecraft radar antennas based on cold hibernated elastic memory (CHEM) structures. Described in a number of prior NASA Tech Briefs articles, the CHEM concept is one of utilizing open-cell shape-memory-polymer (SMP) foams to make lightweight structures that can be compressed for storage and can later be expanded, then rigidified for use. A CHEM-based antenna according to the proposal would comprise three layers of microstrip patches and transmission lines interspersed with two flat layers of SMP foam, which would serve as both dielectric spacers and as means of deployment. The SMP foam layers would be fabricated at full size at a temperature below the SMP glass-transition temperature (Tg). The layers would be assembled into a unitary structure, which, at temperature above Tg, would be compacted to much smaller thickness, then rolled up for storage. Next, the structure would be cooled to below Tg and kept there during launch. Upon reaching the assigned position in outer space, the structure would be heated above Tg to make it rebound to its original size and shape. The structure as thus deployed would then be rigidified by natural cooling to below Tg\n\nA deployable .015 inch diameter wire antenna\n\nNASA Technical Reports Server (NTRS)\n\nDibiasi, L.\n\n1979-01-01\n\nThis mechanism was developed to dispense a small diameter wire which serves as a receiving antenna for electric field measurements on an Earth orbiting satellite. The antenna is deployed radially from a spinning satellite. A brushless dc motor drives a storage spool to dispense the wire at a controlled rate. Centrifugal force, acting on a mass attached to the end of the wire, keeps the wire in the radial position. The mechanism design, testing, and performance characteristics are discussed. Finally, operational data of the mechanism while in orbit are presented.\n\nSimulation of patch and slot antennas using FEM with prismatic elements and investigations of artificial absorber mesh termination schemes\n\nNASA Technical Reports Server (NTRS)\n\nGong, J.; Ozdemir, T.; Volakis, J; Nurnberger, M.\n\n1995-01-01\n\nYear 1 progress can be characterized with four major achievements which are crucial toward the development of robust, easy to use antenna analysis code on doubly conformal platforms. (1) A new FEM code was developed using prismatic meshes. This code is based on a new edge based distorted prism and is particularly attractive for growing meshes associated with printed slot and patch antennas on doubly conformal platforms. It is anticipated that this technology will lead to interactive, simple to use codes for a large class of antenna geometries. Moreover, the codes can be expanded to include modeling of the circuit characteristics. An attached report describes the theory and validation of the new prismatic code using reference calculations and measured data collected at the NASA Langley facilities. The agreement between the measured and calculated data is impressive even for the coated patch configuration. (2) A scheme was developed for improved feed modeling in the context of FEM. A new approach based on the voltage continuity condition was devised and successfully tested in modeling coax cables and aperture fed antennas. An important aspect of this new feed modeling approach is the ability to completely separate the feed and antenna mesh regions. In this manner, different elements can be used in each of the regions leading to substantially improved accuracy and meshing simplicity. (3) A most important development this year has been the introduction of the perfectly matched interface (PMI) layer for truncating finite element meshes. So far the robust boundary integral method has been used for truncating the finite element meshes. However, this approach is not suitable for antennas on nonplanar platforms. The PMI layer is a lossy anisotropic absorber with zero reflection at its interface. (4) We were able to interface our antenna code FEMA_CYL (for antennas on cylindrical platforms) with a standard high frequency code. This interface was achieved by first generating\n\nQualification of a High Accuracy Dual-Axis Antenna Deployment and Trimming Mechanism\n\nNASA Technical Reports Server (NTRS)\n\nGossant, Alain; Morichon, Francois\n\n2010-01-01\n\nThe Antenna Deployment and Trimming Mechanism Mark 2 (ADTM Mk2) has been developed to answer today's need for a generic antenna deployment and high accuracy pointing mechanism, allowing RF sensing applications and easier dual deployments configurations. This paper presents the design and evolution from its predecessor, the experience of the design team from kick off to qualification and batch manufacture, as well as some lessons learned from ramping up \"mass-production\" capabilities while implementing customer driven changes. Astrium has manufactured and flown ADTM units for the past 20 years, from an initial deployment-only mechanism developed for the Orion program to today's Eurostar E3000 ADTM family. The Antenna ADTM Mk2 is an evolution of the original ADTM Mk1. Although it uses Mk1 building blocks to minimize risks associated with the development of a new product, it incorporates major evolutions and is the new baseline for Astrium latest generation of Eurostar E3000 telecom satellites.\n\nLarge deployable antenna program. Phase 1: Technology assessment and mission architecture\n\nNASA Technical Reports Server (NTRS)\n\nRogers, Craig A.; Stutzman, Warren L.\n\n1991-01-01\n\nThe program was initiated to investigate the availability of critical large deployable antenna technologies which would enable microwave remote sensing missions from geostationary orbits as required for Mission to Planet Earth. Program goals for the large antenna were: 40-meter diameter, offset-fed paraboloid, and surface precision of 0.1 mm rms. Phase 1 goals were: to review the state-of-the-art for large, precise, wide-scanning radiometers up to 60 GHz; to assess critical technologies necessary for selected concepts; to develop mission architecture for these concepts; and to evaluate generic technologies to support the large deployable reflectors necessary for these missions. Selected results of the study show that deployable reflectors using furlable segments are limited by surface precision goals to 12 meters in diameter, current launch vehicles can place in geostationary only a 20-meter class antenna, and conceptual designs using stiff reflectors are possible with areal densities of 2.4 deg/sq m.\n\nHigh-Capacity Communications from Martian Distances Part 2: Spacecraft Antennas and Power Systems\n\nNASA Technical Reports Server (NTRS)\n\nHodges, Richard E.; Kodis, Mary Anne; Epp, Larry W.; Orr, Richard; Schuchman, Leonard; Collins, Michael; Sands, O. Scott; Vyas, Hemali; Williams, W. Dan\n\n2006-01-01\n\nThis paper summarizes recent advances in antenna and power systems technology to enable a high data rate Ka-band Mars-to-Earth telecommunications system. Promising antenna technologies are lightweight, deployable space qualified structures at least 12-m in diameter (potentially up to 25-m). These technologies include deployable mesh reflectors, inflatable reflectarray and folded thermosetting composite. Advances in 1kW-class RF power amplifiers include both TWTA and SSPA technologies.\n\nModeling and analysis of a large deployable antenna structure\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nChu, Zhengrong; Deng, Zongquan; Qi, Xiaozhi; Li, Bing\n\n2014-02-01\n\nOne kind of large deployable antenna (LDA) structure is proposed by combining a number of basic deployable units in this paper. In order to avoid vibration caused by fast deployment speed of the mechanism, a braking system is used to control the spring-actuated system. Comparisons between the LDA structure and a similar structure used by the large deployable reflector (LDR) indicate that the former has potential for use in antennas with up to 30 m aperture due to its lighter weight. The LDA structure is designed to form a spherical surface found by the least square fitting method so that it can be symmetrical. In this case, the positions of the terminal points in the structure are determined by two principles. A method to calculate the cable network stretched on the LDA structure is developed, which combines the original force density method and the parabolic surface constraint. Genetic algorithm is applied to ensure that each cable reaches a desired tension, which avoids the non-convergence issue effectively. We find that the pattern for the front and rear cable net must be the same when finding the shape of the rear cable net, otherwise anticlastic surface would generate.\n\nWRAP-RIB antenna technology development\n\nNASA Technical Reports Server (NTRS)\n\nFreeland, R. E.; Garcia, N. F.; Iwamoto, H.\n\n1985-01-01\n\nThe wrap-rib deployable antenna concept development is based on a combination of hardware development and testing along with extensive supporting analysis. The proof-of-concept hardware models are large in size so they will address the same basic problems associated with the design fabrication, assembly and test as the full-scale systems which were selected to be 100 meters at the beginning of the program. The hardware evaluation program consists of functional performance tests, design verification tests and analytical model verification tests. Functional testing consists of kinematic deployment, mesh management and verification of mechanical packaging efficiencies. Design verification consists of rib contour precision measurement, rib cross-section variation evaluation, rib materials characterizations and manufacturing imperfections assessment. Analytical model verification and refinement include mesh stiffness measurement, rib static and dynamic testing, mass measurement, and rib cross-section characterization. This concept was considered for a number of potential applications that include mobile communications, VLBI, and aircraft surveillance. In fact, baseline system configurations were developed by JPL, using the appropriate wrap-rib antenna, for all three classes of applications.\n\nShape Analysis and Deployment of the ExaVolt Antenna\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nBaginski, Frank; Zhao, Kaiyu; Furer, Joshua; Landay, Justin; Bailoor, Shantanu; Gorham, Peter; Varner, Gary; Miki, Christian; Hill, Brian; Schoorlemmer, Harm; Nguyen, Liem; Romero-Wolf, Andrew; Liewer, Kurt; Sauder, Jonathan; Brakke, Kenneth; Beatty, Jim; Connolly, Amy; Allison, Patrick; Pfendner, Carl; Dailey, Brian; Fairbrother, Debra; Said, Magdi; Lang, Steven; Young, Leyland\n\nThe ExaVolt Antenna (EVA) is the next generation balloon-borne ultra-high energy (UHE) particle observatory under development for NASAâs suborbital super-pressure balloon program in Antarctica. Unlike a typical mission where the balloon lifts a gondola that carries the primary scientific instrument, the EVA mission is a first-of-its-kind in that the balloon itself is part of the science instrument. Specifically, a toroidal RF reflector is mounted onto the outside surface of a superpressure balloon (SPB) and a feed antenna is suspended inside the balloon, creating a high-gain antenna system with a synoptic view of the Antarctic ice sheet. The EVA mission presents a number of technical challenges. For example, can a stowed feed antenna be inserted through an opening in the top-plate? Can the feed antenna be deployed during the ascent? Once float altitude is achieved, how might small shape changes in the balloon shape affect the antenna performance over the life of the EVA mission? The EVA team utilized a combination of testing with a 1/20-scale physical model, mathematical modeling and numerical simulations to probe these and related questions. While the problems are challenging, they are solvable with current technology and expertise. Experiments with a 1/20-scale EVA physical model outline a pathway for inserting a stowed feed into a SPB. Analysis indicates the EVA system will ascend, deploy and assume a stable configuration at float altitude. Nominal shape changes in an Antarctic SPB are sufficiently small to allow the use of the surface of the balloon as a high-gain reflector.\n\nAnalysis of the Lenticular Jointed MARSIS Antenna Deployment\n\nNASA Technical Reports Server (NTRS)\n\nMobrem, Mehran; Adams, Douglas S.\n\n2006-01-01\n\nThis paper summarizes important milestones in a yearlong comprehensive effort which culminated in successful deployments of the MARSIS antenna booms in May and June of 2005. Experimentally measured straight section and hinge properties are incorporated into specialized modeling techniques that are used to simulate the boom lenticular joints. System level models are exercised to understand the boom deployment dynamics and spacecraft level implications. Discussion includes a comparison of ADAMS simulation results to measured flight data taken during the three boom deployments.

E.; Bilyeu, G. D.; Veal, G. R.\n\n1993-01-01\n\nAn experiment conducted in the framework of a NASA In-Space Technology Experiments Program based on a concept of inflatable deployable structures is described. The concept utilizes very low inflation pressure to maintain the required geometry on orbit and gravity-induced deflection of the structure precludes any meaningful ground-based demonstrations of functions performance. The experiment is aimed at validating and characterizing the mechanical functional performance of a 14-m-diameter inflatable deployable reflector antenna structure in the orbital operational environment. Results of the experiment are expected to significantly reduce the user risk associated with using large space-deployable antennas by demonstrating the functional performance of a concept that meets the criteria for low-cost, lightweight, and highly reliable space-deployable structures.\n\nAntenna Deployment for the Localization of Partial Discharges in Open-Air Substations\n\nPubMed Central\n\nRobles, Guillermo; Fresno, JosÃ© Manuel; SÃ¡nchez-FernÃ¡ndez, Matilde; MartÃ­nez-Tarifa, Juan Manuel\n\n2016-01-01\n\nPartial discharges are ionization processes inside or on the surface of dielectrics that can unveil insulation problems in electrical equipment. The charge accumulated is released under certain environmental and voltage conditions attacking the insulation both physically and chemically. The final consequence of a continuous occurrence of these events is the breakdown of the dielectric. The electron avalanche provokes a derivative of the electric field with respect to time, creating an electromagnetic impulse that can be detected with antennas. The localization of the source helps in the identification of the piece of equipment that has to be decommissioned. This can be done by deploying antennas and calculating the time difference of arrival (TDOA) of the electromagnetic pulses. However, small errors in this parameter can lead to great displacements of the calculated position of the source. Usually, four antennas are used to find the source but the array geometry has to be correctly deployed to have minimal errors in the localization. This paper demonstrates, by an analysis based on simulation and also experimentally, that the most common layouts are not always the best options and proposes a simple antenna layout to reduce the systematic error in the TDOA calculation due to the positions of the antennas in the array.

To support this use-case, a novel design-order sliding mesh algorithm has been developed and deployed. The hybrid method combines the control volume finite element methodology (CVFEM) with concepts found within a discontinuous Galerkin (DG) finite element method (FEM) to manage a sliding mesh. The method has been demonstrated to be design-order for the tested polynomial basis (P=1 and P=2) and has been deployed to provide production simulation capability for a Vestas V27 (225 kW) wind turbine. Other stationary and canonical rotating ow simulations are also presented. As the majority of wind-energymoreÂ Â» applications are driving extensive usage of hybrid meshes, a foundational study that outlines near-wall numerical behavior for a variety of element topologies is presented. Results indicate that the proposed nonlinear stabilization operator (NSO) is an effective stabilization methodology to control Gibbs phenomena at large cell Peclet numbers. The study also provides practical mesh resolution guidelines for future analysis efforts. Application-driven performance and algorithmic improvements have been carried out to increase robustness of the scheme on hybrid production wind energy meshes. Specifically, the Kokkos-based Nalu Kernel construct outlined in the FY17/Q4 ExaWind milestone has been transitioned to the hybrid mesh regime. This code base is exercised within a full V27 production run. Simulation timings for parallel search and custom ghosting are presented. As the low-Mach application space requires implicit matrix solves, the cost of matrix reinitialization has been evaluated on a variety of production meshes. Results indicate that at low element counts, i.e., fewer than 100 million elements, matrix graph initialization and preconditioner setup times are small. However, as mesh sizes increase, e.g., 500 million elements, simulation time associated with \\\\setup-up\" costs can increase to\n\nThe 15-meter diameter mechanically scanned deployable antenna\n\nNASA Technical Reports Server (NTRS)\n\nCoyner, J.

This analysis process has two main steps. In the first step, a two-variable-parameter (2-VP) membrane model is developed to determine the in-plane stress distribution of the membrane due to pre-tensioning, which eventually yields the differential stiffness of the membrane. In the second step, the obtained differential stiffness is incorporated in a dynamic equation governing the transverse vibration of the membrane-frame assembly. This dynamic equation is then solved by a semi-analytical method, called the Distributed Transfer Function Method (DTFM), which produces the natural frequencies and mode shapes of the antenna. The combination of the 2-VP model and the DTFM provides an accurate prediction of the in-plane stress distribution and modes of vibration for the antenna.\n\nOptimal sensor placement for deployable antenna module health monitoring in SSPS using genetic algorithm\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nYang, Chen; Zhang, Xuepan; Huang, Xiaoqi; Cheng, ZhengAi; Zhang, Xinghua; Hou, Xinbin\n\n2017-11-01\n\nThe concept of space solar power satellite (SSPS) is an advanced system for collecting solar energy in space and transmitting it wirelessly to earth. However, due to the long service life, in-orbit damage may occur in the structural system of SSPS. Therefore, sensor placement layouts for structural health monitoring should be firstly considered in this concept. In this paper, based on genetic algorithm, an optimal sensor placement method for deployable antenna module health monitoring in SSPS is proposed. According to the characteristics of the deployable antenna module, the designs of sensor placement are listed. Furthermore, based on effective independence method and effective interval index, a combined fitness function is defined to maximize linear independence in targeted modes while simultaneously avoiding redundant information at nearby positions. In addition, by considering the reliability of sensors located at deployable mechanisms, another fitness function is constituted. Moreover, the solution process of optimal sensor placement by using genetic algorithm is clearly demonstrated. At last, a numerical example about the sensor placement layout in a deployable antenna module of SSPS is presented, which by synthetically considering all the above mentioned performances. All results can illustrate the effectiveness and feasibility of the proposed sensor placement method in SSPS.\n\nUltra-Compact Ka-Band Parabolic Deployable Antenna for RADAR and Interplanetary CubeSats\n\nNASA Technical Reports Server (NTRS)\n\nSauder, Jonathan; Chahat, Nacer; Thomson, Mark; Hodges, Richard; Peral, Eva; Rahmat-Samii, Yahya\n\n2015-01-01\n\nOver the past several years, technology and launch opportunities for CubeSats have exploded, enabling a wide variety of missions. However, as instruments become more complex and CubeSats travel deeper into space, data communication rates become an issue. To solve this challenge, JPL has initiated a research and technology development effort to design a 0.5 meter Ka-band parabolic deployable antenna (KaPDA) which would stow in 1.5U (10 x 10 x 15 cu cm) and provide 42dB of gain (50% efficiency). A folding rib architecture and dual reflector Cassegrainian design was selected as it best balances RF gain and stowed size. The design implements an innovative telescoping waveguide and gas powered deployment. RF simulations show that after losses, the antenna would have over 42 dB gain, supported by preliminary test results. KaPDA would create opportunities for a host of new CubeSat missions by allowing high data rate communication which would enable using high fidelity instruments or venturing further into deep space, including potential interplanetary missions. Additionally KaPDA would provide a solution for other small antenna needs and the opportunity to obtain Earth science data. This paper discusses the design challenges encountered, the architecture of the solution, and the antennas expected performance capabilities.\n\nDeployment of the MARSIS Radar Antennas On-Board Mars Express\n\nNASA Technical Reports Server (NTRS)\n\nDenis, Michel; Moorhouse, A.; Smith, A.; McKay, Mike; Fischer, J.; Jayaraman, P.; Mounzer, Z.; Schmidt, R.; Reddy, J.; Ecale, E.;\n\n2006-01-01\n\nOn the first European planetary mission, the deployment of the two 20-meter long MARSIS antennas onboard the ESA Mars Express spacecraft has represented an unprecedented technological challenge, in the middle of a successful science mission.

It provides insights in the technical and managerial processes that made it a success, and analyses the rationale behind the decisions.\n\nElectromagnetic Simulations for an Axisymmetric Gregorian Reflector System for a Space Deployed Inflatable Antenna\n\nDTIC Science & Technology\n\n2016-01-22\n\nQ.

R.; You, Z.\n\n2013-12-01\n\nThis paper describes a number of large deployable antenna (LDA) reflector structure concepts developed at EnerSys-ABSL. Furthermore, EnerSys-ABSL has confirmed the desire to build a breadboard demonstrator of a backing deployable structure for a foldable reflector in the diameter range of 4-9 m. As part of this project EnerSys-ABSL has explored five novel deployable structure concepts. This paper presents the top level definition of these concepts together with the requirements considered in the design and selection of the preferred candidate. These new concepts are described and then compared through a trade-off analysis to identify the most suitable concept that EnerSys-ABSL would like to consider for the breadboard demonstrator. Finally, the kinematics of the chosen concept is described in more detail and future steps in the development process are highlighted.\n\nEvolution from a hinge actuator mechanism to an antenna deployment mechanism for use on the European large communications satellite (L-SAT/OLYMPUS)\n\nNASA Technical Reports Server (NTRS)\n\nDeath, M.

This work describes the design and operational features of the system for antenna storage and deployment, and the design and simulations of the solar array deployment system. It explains the various problems faced and solutions adopted, with a view to providing valid data for any other applications that could find them useful, be they of a similar nature or not.\n\nThe development and testing of the Lens Antenna Deployment Demonstration (LADD) test article\n\nNASA Technical Reports Server (NTRS)\n\nPugh, Mark L.; Denton, Robert J., Jr.; Strange, Timothy J.\n\n1993-01-01\n\nThe USAF Rome Laboratory and NASA Marshall Space Flight Center, through contract to Grumman Corporation, have developed a space-qualifiable test article for the Strategic Defense Initiative Organization to demonstrate the critical structural and mechanical elements of single-axis roll-out membrane deployment for Space Based Radar (SBR) applications. The Lens Antenna Deployment Demonstration (LADD) test article, originally designed as a shuttle-attached flight experiment, is a large precision space structure which is representative of operational designs for space-fed lens antennas. Although the flight experiment was cancelled due to funding constraints and major revisions in the Strategic Defense System (SDS) architecture, development of this test article was completed in June 1989. To take full advantage of the existence of this unique structure, a series of ground tests are proposed which include static, dynamic, and thermal measurements in a simulated space environment. An equally important objective of these tests is the verification of the analytical tools used to design and develop large precision space structures.\n\nMechanical Technology Development on A 35-m Deployable Radar Antenna for Monitoring Hurricanes\n\nNASA Technical Reports Server (NTRS)\n\nFang, Houfei; Im, Eastwood\n\n2006-01-01\n\nThe NEXRAD in Space project develops a novel instrument concept and the associated antenna technologies for a 35-GHz Doppler radar to monitor hurricanes, cyclones, and severe storms from a geostationary orbit. Mechanical challenges of this concept include a 35-m diameter lightweight in space deployable spherical reflector and a feeder scanning mechanism. The feasibility of using shape memory polymer material to develop the large deployable reflector has been investigated by this study. A spiral scanning mechanism concept has been developed and demonstrated by an engineering model.\n\nEffective conductivity of wire mesh reflectors for space deployable antenna systems\n\nNASA Technical Reports Server (NTRS)\n\nDavis, William A.\n\n1994-01-01\n\nThis report summarizes efforts to characterize the measurement of conductive mesh and smooth surfaces using proximity measurements for a dielectric resonator. The resonator operates in the HEM11 mode and is shown to have an evanescent field behavior in the vicinity of the sample surface, raising some question to the validity of measurements requiring near normal incidence on the material. In addition, the slow radial field decay outside of the dielectric resonator validates the sensitivity to the planar supporting structure and potential radiation effects. Though these concerns become apparent along with the sensitivity to the gap between the dielectric and the material surface, the basic concept of the material measurement using dielectric resonators has been verified for useful comparison of material surface properties. The properties, particularly loss, may be obtained by monitoring the resonant frequency along with the resonator quality factor (Q), 3 dB bandwidth, or the midband transmission amplitude. Comparison must be made to known materials to extract the desired data.\n\nShape accuracy optimization for cable-rib tension deployable antenna structure with tensioned cables\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nLiu, Ruiwei; Guo, Hongwei; Liu, Rongqiang; Wang, Hongxiang; Tang, Dewei; Song, Xiaoke\n\n2017-11-01\n\nShape accuracy is of substantial importance in deployable structures as the demand for large-scale deployable structures in various fields, especially in aerospace engineering, increases. The main purpose of this paper is to present a shape accuracy optimization method to find the optimal pretensions for the desired shape of cable-rib tension deployable antenna structure with tensioned cables. First, an analysis model of the deployable structure is established by using finite element method. In this model, geometrical nonlinearity is considered for the cable element and beam element. Flexible deformations of the deployable structure under the action of cable network and tensioned cables are subsequently analyzed separately. Moreover, the influence of pretension of tensioned cables on natural frequencies is studied. Based on the results, a genetic algorithm is used to find a set of reasonable pretension and thus minimize structural deformation under the first natural frequency constraint. Finally, numerical simulations are presented to analyze the deployable structure under two kinds of constraints. Results show that the shape accuracy and natural frequencies of deployable structure can be effectively improved by pretension optimization.\n\nCompact, Lightweight Dual-Frequency Microstrip Antenna Feed for Future Soil Moisture and Sea Surface Salinity Missions\n\nNASA Technical Reports Server (NTRS)\n\nYueh, Simon; Wilson, William J.; Njoku, Eni; Dinardo, Steve; Hunter, Don; Rahmat-Samii, Yahya; Kona, Keerti S.; Manteghi, Majid\n\n2006-01-01\n\nThe development of a compact, lightweight, dual-frequency antenna feed for future soil moisture and sea surface salinity (SSS) missions is described.

The design features will also enable applications to airborne soil moisture and salinity remote sensing sensors operating on small aircrafts. This paper describes the design of stacked patch elements and 16-element array configuration.

In the ExaWind project, we are developing both sliding-mesh and overset-mesh approaches for handling the rotating blades in an operating wind turbine. In the sliding-mesh approach, the turbine rotor and its immediate surrounding fluid are captured in a âdiskâ that is embedded in the larger fluid domain. The embedded fluid is simulated in a coordinate system that rotates with the rotor. It is important that the coupling algorithm (and its implementation) between the rotating and inertial discrete modelsmoreÂ Â» maintains the accuracy of the numerical methods on either side of the interface, i.e., the interface is âdesign order.âÂ«Â less\n\nSurface accuracy analysis and mathematical modeling of deployable large aperture elastic antenna reflectors\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nColeman, Michael J.\n\nOne class of deployable large aperture antenna consists of thin light-weight parabolic reflectors. A reflector of this type is a deployable structure that consists of an inflatable elastic membrane that is supported about its perimeter by a set of elastic tendons and is subjected to a constant hydrostatic pressure. A design may not hold the parabolic shape to within a desired tolerance due to an elastic deformation of the surface, particularly near the rim. We can compute the equilibrium configuration of the reflector system using an optimization-based solution procedure that calculates the total system energy and determines a configuration of minimum energy. Analysis of the equilibrium configuration reveals the behavior of the reflector shape under various loading conditions. The pressure, film strain energy, tendon strain energy, and gravitational energy are all considered in this analysis. The surface accuracy of the antenna reflector is measured by an RMS calculation while the reflector phase error component of the efficiency is determined by computing the power density at boresight. Our error computation methods are tailored for the faceted surface of our model and they are more accurate for this particular problem than the commonly applied Ruze Equation. Previous analytical work on parabolic antennas focused on axisymmetric geometries and loads. Symmetric equilibria are not assumed in our analysis. In addition, this dissertation contains two principle original findings: (1) the typical supporting tendon system tends to flatten a parabolic reflector near its edge. We find that surface accuracy can be significantly improved by fixing the edge of the inflated reflector to a rigid structure; (2) for large membranes assembled from flat sheets of thin material, we demonstrate that the surface accuracy of the resulting inflated membrane reflector can be improved by altering the cutting pattern of the flat components. Our findings demonstrate that the proper choice\n\nMicrostrip Antenna for Remote Sensing of Soil Moisture and Sea Surface Salinity\n\nNASA Technical Reports Server (NTRS)\n\nRamhat-Samii, Yahya; Kona, Keerti; Manteghi, Majid; Dinardo, Steven; Hunter, Don; Njoku, Eni; Wilson, Wiliam; Yueh, Simon\n\n2009-01-01\n\nThis compact, lightweight, dual-frequency antenna feed developed for future soil moisture and sea surface salinity (SSS) missions can benefit future soil and ocean studies by lowering mass, volume, and cost of the antenna system. It also allows for airborne soil moisture and salinity remote sensors operating on small aircraft. While microstrip antenna technology has been developed for radio communications, it has yet to be applied to combined radar and radiometer for Earth remote sensing. The antenna feed provides a key instrument element enabling high-resolution radiometric observations with large, deployable antennas. The design is based on the microstrip stacked-patch array (MSPA) used to feed a large, lightweight, deployable, rotating mesh antenna for spaceborne L-band (approximately equal to 1 GHz) passive and active sensing systems. The array consists of stacked patches to provide dual-frequency capability and suitable radiation patterns. The stacked-patch microstrip element was designed to cover the required L-band center frequencies at 1.26 GHz (lower patch) and 1.413 GHz (upper patch), with dual-linear polarization capabilities. The dimension of patches produces the required frequencies. To achieve excellent polarization isolation and control of antenna sidelobes for the MSPA, the orientation of each stacked-patch element within the array is optimized to reduce the cross-polarization. A specialized feed-distribution network was designed to achieve the required excitation amplitude and phase for each stacked-patch element.\n\nNear-field Testing of the 15-meter Model of the Hoop Column Antenna\n\nNASA Technical Reports Server (NTRS)\n\nHoover, J.; Kefauver, N.; Cencich, T.; Osborn, J.; Osmanski, J.\n\n1986-01-01\n\nThe technical results from near-field testing of the 15-meter model of the hoop column antenna at the Martin Marietta Denver Aerospace facility are documented. The antenna consists of a deployable central column and a 15 meter hoop, stiffened by cables into a structure with a high tolerance repeatable surface and offset feed location. The surface has been configured to have four offset parabolic apertures, each about 6 meters in diameter, and is made of gold plated molybdenum wire mesh. Pattern measurements were made with feed systems radiating at frequencies of 7.73, 11.60, 2.27, 2.225, and 4.26 (all in GHz). This report (Volume 1) covers the testing from an overall viewpoint and contains information of generalized interest for testing large antennas. This volume discusses the deployment of the antenna in the Martin Facility and the measurements to determine mechanical stability and trueness of the reflector surface, gives the test program outline, and gives a synopsis of antenna electromagnetic performance. Three techniques for measuring surface mechanical tolerances were used (theodolites, metric cameras, and near-field phase), but only the near-field phase approach is included. The report also includes an error analysis. A detailed listing of the antenna patterns are provided for the 2.225 Ghz feed in Volume 3 of this report, and for all other feeds in Volume 2.\n\nInflatable Space Structures Technology Development for Large Radar Antennas\n\nNASA Technical Reports Server (NTRS)\n\nFreeland, R. E.; Helms, Richard G.; Willis, Paul B.; Mikulas, M. M.; Stuckey, Wayne; Steckel, Gary; Watson, Judith\n\n2004-01-01\n\nThere has been recent interest in inflatable space-structures technology for possible applications on U.S. Department of Defense (DOD) missions because of the technology's potential for high mechanical-packaging efficiency, variable stowed geometry, and deployment reliability. In recent years, the DOD sponsored Large Radar Antenna (LRA) Program applied this new technology to a baseline concept: a rigidizable/inflatable (RI) perimeter-truss structure supporting a mesh/net parabolic reflector antenna. The program addressed: (a) truss concept development, (b) regidizable materials concepts assessment, (c) mesh/net concept selection and integration, and (d) developed potential mechanical-system performance estimates. Critical and enabling technologies were validated, most notably the orbital radiation durable regidized materials and the high modulus, inflatable-deployable truss members. These results in conjunction with conclusions from previous mechanical-packaging studies by the U.S. Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) Special Program Office (SPO) were the impetus for the initiation of the DARPA/SPO Innovative Space-based Antenna Technology (ISAT) Program. The sponsor's baseline concept consisted of an inflatable-deployable truss structure for support of a large number of rigid, active radar panels. The program's goal was to determine the risk associated with the application of these new RI structures to the latest in radar technologies. The approach used to define the technology maturity level of critical structural elements was to: (a) develop truss concept baseline configurations (s), (b) assess specific inflatable-rigidizable materials technologies, and (c) estimate potential mechanical performance. The results of the structures portion of the program indicated there was high risk without the essential materials technology flight experiments, but only moderate risk if the appropriate on-orbit demonstrations were performed. This paper covers both\n\nModeling and Control of the Redundant Parallel Adjustment Mechanism on a Deployable Antenna Panel\n\nPubMed Central\n\nTian, Lili; Bao, Hong; Wang, Meng; Duan, Xuechao\n\n2016-01-01\n\nWith the aim of developing multiple input and multiple output (MIMO) coupling systems with a redundant parallel adjustment mechanism on the deployable antenna panel, a structural control integrated design methodology is proposed in this paper. Firstly, the modal information from the finite element model of the structure of the antenna panel is extracted, and then the mathematical model is established with the Hamilton principle; Secondly, the discrete Linear Quadratic Regulator (LQR) controller is added to the model in order to control the actuators and adjust the shape of the panel. Finally, the engineering practicality of the modeling and control method based on finite element analysis simulation is verified.

Firstly, the method of combining topology with screw theory is put forward. The parametric model and the constrained matrix are established to analyze the malleability of 3RR-3RRR tetrahedral element. Secondly, the kinematics expression of each motion pair is deduced by the relationship between the velocity and the motion spinor. Finally, the configuration of the metamorphic element is optimized to make the parabolic antenna fully folded, so that the antenna can meet the maximum folding ratio. The results show that the 3RR-3RRR element is a single-degree of freedom (DOF) mechanism. What's more, three new configurations 3RS-3RRR, 3SR-3RRR and 3UU-3RRR are obtained on the basis of optimization. In particular, it proves to be that the LDR which consists of the 3RS-3RRR metamorphic element can achieve the maximum folding ratio. This paper provides a theoretical basis for the computer-aided design of the truss antennas, which has an excellent applicability in the field of aerospace and other multi-loop coupling mechanism.\n\nA Mars Riometer: Antenna Considerations\n\nNASA Technical Reports Server (NTRS)\n\nFry, Craig D.\n\n2001-01-01\n\nThis is the final report on NASA Grant NAG5-9706. This project explored riometer (relative ionospheric opacity meter) antenna designs that would be practical for a Mars surface or balloon mission. The riometer is an important radio science instrument for terrestrial aeronomy investigations. The riometer measures absorption of cosmic radio waves by the overhead ionosphere. Studies have shown the instrument should work well on Mars, which has an appreciable daytime ionosphere. There has been concern that the required radio receiver antenna (with possibly a 10 meter scale size) would be too large or too difficult to deploy on Mars. This study addresses those concerns and presents several antenna designs and deployment options. It is found that a Mars balloon would provide an excellent platform for the riometer antenna. The antenna can be incorporated into the envelope design, allowing self-deployment of the antenna as the balloon inflates.\n\nJPL self pulsed laser surface measurement system development.

Tests with a breadboard system verified functional operation with short time resolution on the order of .2 mm, nonambiguous ranging, and a maximum range capability on the order of 150 m. The projected capability of the system is resolution of less than .1 mm over a reasonable time period and a range extension to over 300 m.\n\nLSST (Hoop/Column) Maypole Antenna Development Program, phase 1, part 1\n\nNASA Technical Reports Server (NTRS)\n\nSullivan, M. R.\n\n1982-01-01\n\nThe first of a two-phase program was performed to develop the technology necessary to evaluate, design, manufacture, package, transport and deploy the hoop/column deployable antenna reflector by means of a ground based program. The hoop/column concept consists of a cable stiffened large diameter hoop and central column structure that supports and contours a radio frequency reflective mesh surface. Mission scenarios for communications, radiometer and radio astronomy, were studied. The data to establish technology drivers that resulted in a specification of a point design was provided. The point design is a multiple beam quadaperture offset antenna system wich provides four separate offset areas of illumination on a 100 meter diameter symmetrical parent reflector. The periphery of the reflector is a hoop having 48 segments that articulate into a small stowed volume around a center extendable column. The hoop and column are structurally connected by graphite and quartz cables. The prominence of cables in the design resulted in the development of advanced cable technology. Design verification models were built of the hoop, column, and surface stowage subassemblies. Model designs were generated for a half scale sector of the surface and a 1/6 scale of the complete deployable reflector.\n\nA parallel graded-mesh FDTD algorithm for human-antenna interaction problems.\n\nPubMed\n\nCatarinucci, Luca; Tarricone, Luciano\n\n2009-01-01\n\nThe finite difference time domain method (FDTD) is frequently used for the numerical solution of a wide variety of electromagnetic (EM) problems and, among them, those concerning human exposure to EM fields. In many practical cases related to the assessment of occupational EM exposure, large simulation domains are modeled and high space resolution adopted, so that strong memory and central processing unit power requirements have to be satisfied. To better afford the computational effort, the use of parallel computing is a winning approach; alternatively, subgridding techniques are often implemented. However, the simultaneous use of subgridding schemes and parallel algorithms is very new. In this paper, an easy-to-implement and highly-efficient parallel graded-mesh (GM) FDTD scheme is proposed and applied to human-antenna interaction problems, demonstrating its appropriateness in dealing with complex occupational tasks and showing its capability to guarantee the advantages of a traditional subgridding technique without affecting the parallel FDTD performance.\n\nBox truss analysis and technology development.

V.\n\n1985-01-01\n\nAn analytical tool was developed to model, analyze and predict RF performance of box truss antennas with reflective mesh surfaces. The analysis system is unique in that it integrates custom written programs for cord tied mesh surfaces, thereby drastically reducing the cost of analysis. The analysis system is capable of determining the RF performance of antennas under any type of manufacturing or operating environment by integrating together the various disciplines of design, finite element analysis, surface best fit analysis and RF analysis. The Integrated Mesh Analysis System consists of six separate programs: The Mesh Tie System Model Generator, The Loadcase Generator, The Model Optimizer, The Model Solver, The Surface Topography Solver and The RF Performance Solver. Additionally, a study using the mesh analysis system was performed to determine the effect of on orbit calibration, i.e., surface adjustment, on a typical box truss antenna.\n\nAntenna Technologies for NASA Applications\n\nNASA Technical Reports Server (NTRS)\n\nMiranda, Felix\n\n2007-01-01\n\nThis presentation addresses the efforts being performed at GRC to develop antenna technology in support of NASA s Exploration Vision.

R.; Gilger, L. D.; Ard, K. E.\n\n1985-01-01\n\nThermal and mechanical distortion degrade the RF performance of antennas. The complexity of future communications antennas requires accurate, dimensionally stable antenna reflectors and structures built from materials other than those currently used. The advantages and disadvantages of using carbon fibers in an epoxy matrix are reviewed as well as current reflector fabrications technology and adjustment. The manufacturing sequence and coefficient of thermal expansion of carbon fiber/borosilicate glass composites is described. The construction of a parabolic reflector from this material and the assembling of both reflector and antenna are described. A 3M-aperture-diameter carbon/glass reflector that can be used as a subassembly for large reflectors is depicted. The deployment sequence for a 10.5M-aperture-diameter antenna, final reflector adjustment, and the deployment sequence for large reflectors are also illustrated.\n\nDeployable Fresnel Rings\n\nNASA Technical Reports Server (NTRS)\n\nKennedy, Timothy F.; Fink, Patrick W.; Chu, Andrew W.; Lin, Gregory Y.\n\n2014-01-01\n\nDeployable Fresnel rings (DFRs) significantly enhance the realizable gain of an antenna. This innovation is intended to be used in combination with another antenna element, as the DFR itself acts as a focusing or microwave lens element for a primary antenna. This method is completely passive, and is also completely wireless in that it requires neither a cable, nor a connector from the antenna port of the primary antenna to the DFR. The technology improves upon the previous NASA technology called a Tri-Sector Deployable Array Antenna in at least three critical aspects. In contrast to the previous technology, this innovation requires no connector, cable, or other physical interface to the primary communication radio or sensor device. The achievable improvement in terms of antenna gain is significantly higher than has been achieved with the previous technology. Also, where previous embodiments of the Tri-Sector antenna have been constructed with combinations of conventional (e.g., printed circuit board) and conductive fabric materials, this innovation is realized using only conductive and non-conductive fabric (i.e., \"e-textile\") materials, with the possible exception of a spring-like deployment ring. Conceptually, a DFR operates by canceling the out-of-phase radiation at a plane by insertion of a conducting ring or rings of a specific size and distance from the source antenna, defined by Fresnel zones. Design of DFRs follow similar procedures to those outlined for conventional Fresnel zone rings. Gain enhancement using a single ring is verified experimentally and through computational simulation. The experimental test setup involves a microstrip patch antenna that is directly behind a single-ring DFR and is radiating towards a second microstrip patch antenna. The first patch antenna and DFR are shown. At 2.42 GHz, the DFR improves the transmit antenna gain by 8.6 dB, as shown in Figure 2, relative to the wireless link without the DFR. A figure illustrates the\n\nCollapsible structure for an antenna reflector\n\nNASA Technical Reports Server (NTRS)\n\nTrubert, M. R.

The view was photographed with an Electronic Still Camera (ESC) and downlinked to flight controllers on the first full day of orbital operations by the six-member crew. Managed by Goddard Space Flight Center (GSFC), Spartan is designed to provide short-duration, free-flight opportunities for a variety of scientific studies. The Spartan configuration on this flight is unique in that the IAE is part of an additional separate unit which is ejected once the experiment is completed. The IAE experiment will lay the groundwork for future technology development in inflatable space structures, which will be launched and then inflated like a balloon on-orbit.
