This makes these sanctuaries important to a diverse, economically vital human user community and for biodiversity conservation. As a result, appropriate sanctuary management must balance conflicting goals. Fortunately, sanctuaries have been early adapters in marine planning. Marine planning is a transparent, ecosystem-based, science-driven decision making process developed with a high level of stakeholder and public involve-ment. As established marine planning practitioners, national marine sanctuaries can provide valuable case studies and insights. Marine Planning in Action for example, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration&#39;s (NOAA) Stellwagen Bank National Marine Sanctuary, an 852-square-mile marine pro-tected area located off the coast of Massachusetts and New Hampshire, hosts some of the largest aggrega-tions of endangered large w..."
