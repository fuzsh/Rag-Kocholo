        "text": "Savyon Liebrecht’s four collections of stories (see list on Author page) have made her what Haaretz called “a kind of signpost of modern Hebrew prose.” Her writing depicts a broad panorama of contemporary Israeli society, and reveals the passionate and intense layer under seemingly ordinary lives. Liebrecht’s characters are often plagued by high-fidelity memory, and frequently conduct a running dialog with the past. When a story ends in reality, it lives on in memory. In some ways, love stories never have endings. These stories are touched by the uncanny, strange instances that can neither be explained nor dismissed. In describing these dramatic moments in her characters’ lives, Liebrecht exposes their vulnerabilities and failings. Her descriptions probe wounded souls with delicacy and sensitivity.\n\nSeveral stories from this collection appear in the English edition of Apples from the Desert."
