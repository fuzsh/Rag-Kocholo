        "text": "The Hungarian Republic, which emerged from of the ashes of Austria-Hungary, experienced two revolutions between October 1918 and April 1919. However, neither the democratic regime nor the more radical Soviet Republic born in these revolutions was able to solve the country's most pressing economic and social problems. The collapse of the Soviet Republic at the end of July 1919, in turn, was followed by a rapid rise in extra-legal violence. Freikorps units (szabadcsapatok) and civic guards (polgárőrségek), aided by the members of the local police, set up kangaroo courts, organized summary executions, and ignited pogroms in the central and western parts of the country.\n\n1 For example, Zsuzsa L. Nagy argues that about 5,000 people were murdered and 70,000 were imprisoned during the White Terror. See Ránki, György, Hajdu, Tibor, and Tilkovszky, Lóránd eds., Magyarország története [The History of Hungary]. 1918–1919. 1919–1945 (Budapest, 1976), 397Google Scholar. At the other end of the spectrum, Krisztián Ungváry put the number of victims at 1,500. He argued that the Romanian Army murdered more than half of the victims. See “Sacco di Budapest, 1919.

To the traditional Marxist accusations, Hollós added a new charge: The counterrevolution of 1919, he argued, led directly to the “counterrevolution” of 1956. Professional historians feared Hollós, who, as an informer, was in the position to make and unmake professional careers. Given the political importance of the topic as a means of legitimization, it came as no surprise that the topic of paramilitary and state remained the exclusive reserve of party hardliners to the end of the regime in 1990. Hollós, Ervin and Lajtai, Vera, Horthy Miklós: A fehérek vezére (Budapest, 1985)Google Scholar.

Counterrevolutions were national in scope, city-based, well-organized, and lavishly financed. Peasant-led antirevolutions, on the other hand, were local or at best regional in scope and were poorly financed, organized, and led. The counterrevolutionaries were intensely ideological, whereas antirevolutionaries “remained impulsive, ill-organized, and parochial despite certain efforts by the counterrevolution from above and abroad to harness, discipline and politicize it for its cause.” Mayer, Arno J., The Furies: Violence and Terror in the French and Russian Revolutions (Princeton, 2000), 59Google Scholar.\n\n38 János Gömbös was the brother of the MOVE chief, Gyula Gömbös; István Stréter was the son of the Minister of Defense; Tibor Rakovszky was the son of the Speaker of the Parliament. János Gömbös had registration number 20, which meant that he was one of the founders of the Prónay Detachment. He executed the member of the local municipal government in Szekszárd on 10 August. He committed suicide in 1927. See Gergely, Jenő, Gömbös Gyula.

István Deák concludes that the decline in noble representation signaled the abandonment of the emperor by its aristocratic families.

It is unclear if Ferenc Le Grande, Le Grade, was a foreigner or only had a foreign last name. Prónay believed that they joined because they wanted to fight Jews. He also added, however, that foreigners had come to Szeged completely impoverished. See Prónay Pál, “Ellenforradalmi naplójegyzeteim 1918–1921,” ÁBTL 4.1. A–738/1, 139.\n\n50 There were 13 men with German surnames in the officer corps of the Ostenburg Battalion in 1920. We do not know how many Germans changed their surnames to Hungarian ones. On the other hand, people with German surnames could be Hungarian by language, culture, and sympathy. See “Ostenburg Zlj. Névjegyzéke,” ÁBTL, 4.1 A–878. Prónay considered, and dismissed, the officers of the Ostenburg Battalion as more German than Hungarian. See Prónay Pál, “Ellenforradalmi naplójegyzeteim 1918–1921,” ÁBTL 4.1. A–738/1, 307.\n\n66 Four of the five people who were responsible for the murder of a police officer, József Soltra, in November 1920 came from working-class backgrounds. One of them, Imre Mészáros, was sentenced to death and executed on 18 December 1920. His three working-class accomplices received long prison sentences. The only middle-class person among the attackers, Attila Rumbold, who was a university student, was originally sentenced to death as well. However, his sentence was subsequently commuted to 15 years in a penitentiary. Rumbolds was released from prison on the basis of Regent Horthy's amnesty order at the end of 1921. See Zinner, Az Ébredők Fénykora, 10.\n\n80 Jews and people of Jewish decent, moreover, could be found in every political camp. The Jewish Kurt Eisner, who held power in Bavaria after the revolution, was assassinated by a young aristocrat, Count Arco auf Valley, on 21 February 1919. At least one ancestor (his maternal grandfather) of Count Arco auf Valley was Jewish. Many young Jewish men, mainly students but also white-collar workers, joined the fight against the Council Republic in Bavaria after Eisner's death. Jewish bankers financed the recruitment of militia members into the Right radical Freikorps in Berlin in December 1919 as well. It was this proto-Fascist group that put down the Spartacist uprising and restored order in the city in early January. During the fight, they captured and brutally murdered the Spartacist leaders, the Jewish Rosa Luxemburg and Karl Liebknecht, and threw, in a typical Freikorps fashion, their remains into one of the city's canals. Jews were also active in the East protecting the country's historical borders against Polish insurgents after World War I. The man who had carried the German flag in the company of Albert Leo Schlageter, whom the Nazis later celebrated as their saint, was a Jew by the name of Alfred Badrian. See Angress, Werner T., “Juden im Politischen Leben der Revolutionzeit,” in Deutsches Judentum in Krieg und Revolution 1916–1923. Ein Sammelband, ed. Mosse, Werner E., 248–301 (Tübingen, 1971)Google Scholar.\n\n82 His name was Imre Klausz; his father, a cantor in the town of Eger, had eleven children, five of whom served in the army during the war. One of his sons, Endre, spent seven years in Serbian captivity. Imre Klausz finished high school in Eger with distinction; he completed one year at the Technical University in Budapest but had to leave school because of his Jewish background. He was an excellent sportsman and won several prizes in swimming. After his dismissal from the university, he served as a volunteer for one year in the army with the rank of corporal. He died on 23 October 1921; he was 22 years old. See Egyenlőség, 6 November 1921.\n\n90 Until March 1921, the militia battalions were paid by the Ministry of Defense. In the fall of 1919, officers' daily stipend was 6 koronas. Daily clothing allowance was 1.5 koronas. Soldiers and militias members were permitted to use the Rudas Spa free of charge. (Katonai Lapok, 13 December 1919). By early 1920, the officers' daily stipend increased to 15 koronas, the rank and file received 5 koronas. See Nemzeti Haderő, 31 January 1920. The monthly stipend of officers was about the same as the monthly salary of university professors. In early 1920, an officer received about 1,500 koronas. The generous stipend explains why so many students, especially refugees, entered the battalions. Many of these students did not even have civilian clothes; hence the request that they could wear their uniforms and display their decoration in the university buildings in May 1920. See Ladányi, Andor, Az egyetemi ifjúság az ellenforradalom első éveiben, (1919–1921) [University students during the first years of the counterrevolution, 1919–1921] (Budapest, 1979), 80–82Google Scholar.\n\n92 Student welfare organizations estimated that in the spring of 1921 about a quarter of students could not cover their basic expenses; one quarter had shelter and enough food but could not heat their rooms and could not buy textbooks. In the fall of 1921, 14–16 percent of students at the Technical University in Budapest were homeless; 36 percent complained that they needed free food and food subsidies to survive; and 45 percent of students needed clothing, shoes, and underwear. See Ladányi, Az egyetemi ifjúság az ellenforradalom első éveiben, 49–55."
