        "text": "“Do you know Lili Darvas?” a woman of the local Hungarian colony once asked another. “No,” wasthe excited reply, “but I'm the best friend of her worst enemy!”\n\nMiss Darvas—pronounced “Darvash”—repeated the remark the other day, adding, with the fatalism of her race, “that's very Hungarian.” The setting was her apartment in the east 70's, a bastion of Magyar charm in one of the few remaining ethnic enclaves in Manhattan. On the walls, accenting the (Hungerian) Biedermeier sofa and chairs, were cozy mementos of her long, distinguished career as a leading Continental and American actress: a pastel portrait of her, showing a young beauty in one of her late husband Ferenc Molnar's plays, a rehearsal snapshot of the great Max Reinhardt in whose companies she was a stellar performer during the 1920's and 1930's, a well‐known Steichen photograph of her with Molnar taken for Vanity Fair, a Carl Van Vechten photograph of her as Coco, the aged courtesan in the New York production of “Cheri” in 1959.\n\n*\n\nBookshelves were lined with boxes of Molnar manuscripts, Molnar documents, multi‐language volumes of his plays. And on her desk, the reason for the present visit — publicity stills from the Hungarian film, “Love,” which she made in Budapest in 1970, for which she was given the government's prestigious Red Star medal, foilowed by the Cannes Festival Critics' Award, followed by accolades from our local reviewers when it was shown at the Film Festival here last autumn (Roger Greenspun in The Times lauded the film as “the most gratifying surprise of the festival” along with Miss Darvas' performance as “a greatly refined beauty in old age”). The film opens for a one‐week run at the First Avenue Screening Room on Thursday.\n\nSpeaking in measured Mittel‐European cadences, Miss Darvas recalled a bit of advice given her by Molnar at the start of her career. “Never try to give an ‘interesting’ interview,” he cautioned her. “Just be dull and they won't misquote you. And never try to correct their mistakes. Whatever they write, just swallow it. I remembered that advice two years ago at the Cannes Festival when the reporters asked how it felt to play a 96‐year‐old woman in ‘Love.’ I said, ‘The older the better.’ Then one of the French papers came out and said I was actually 80 years old. I was then 68 and the producer wanted to make a fuss and get them to change it but I said ‘don't bother’ —even if it was a little much, at my age, to be made 12 years older.”\n\n“Love deals with its title's many‐faceted emotions on two levels — the protective affection of a young Hungarian wife for her ancient, bedridden mother‐in‐law, and the intense devotion of both women to the missing husband and son who is serving a 10‐year term as a political prisoner. The daughter‐in‐law has kept the old woman alive with the fantastic tale that her son was directing a film in New York which has won a prize and that he is being delayed there waiting for the award ceremonies. She brings descriptive letters, purportedly from the son, to bolster the illusion.\n\nThe old woman's alternating states of awareness and semi‐consciousness, as she lies in bed waiting to see her son once more before she dies, are realized in bits of Proustian recall: “memory pictures” flashed upon the screen — old snapshots, luxury items from illustrated period catalogues — provide background for the willfulness, as well as the elegance, still discernible in her face and gestures.\n\nMiss Darvas' involvement with the film goes back to 1965, when she returned to her native Budapest to appear on the stage in Molnar's “Olympia,” playing the character part of the mother (originally she had played the title role, which was written for her). “This young movie director Károly Makk saw me and said he wanted to do a movie with me. He sent me a script to New York in early 1966. And a few weeks later a cable came, ‘Sorry film postponed explanation follows.’ But it was never explained to me and the film never happened.\n\n*\n\n“I went back to Budapest that summer to see Molnar's grandchildren [offspring of his daughter by his first marriage] and Makk asked me would I be interested in another film, from two short stories by Tibor Déry, a very respected Hungarian writer who had been in a political prison for some years in the 1950's, before this very liberal government they have now. One of the stories was ‘Two Women,’ meaning his wife and mother, and the other about the love he felt for them.\n\n“Then for years I heard nothing more. But in January, 1970, I got a telephone call in New York from Hungary, would I be interested? I said sure. Then I got another, embarrassed call. Would I mind telling them how old I am? They were afraid I would want to make myself younger for this film. So I sent them really untouched photos, passport pictures and snapshots. Then I girt another call, would I come, they pay my trip, to make a test, do I look old enough? I don't know if I look 96, but I found out they had also tested the very oldest women. I said, ‘What do you want, an old lady or an actress?’”\n\nShe worked six weeks on the film, her scenes being shot in sequence. “The director and the cameraman would gather around me in the morning and say, ‘How did you sleep?’ I said, ‘Fine.’ They were disgusted. The director said, 'I knew it, there was the most beautiful wrinkle around your eye yesterday and now it's gone. Please, please, try not to sleep so well.”\n\nMiss Darvas thinks that the film was postponed originally because of the political situation in Hungary at the time, and also because the director kept insisting on casting her, a foreigner, for the leading role (she became an American citizen in 1943). The scenes with the imprisoned son were actually shot in the government jail. “I was surprised when I read the script that it was so po litically candid ... but I don't mix with that. What I do care about is the character of the mother, who puts up the fight against death for the one chance of seeing her son once more. Mechanically, her head always turns toward the door. I know about this old lady, because she's a very sophisticated woman, that half of her wanted to believe and half of her played along with her daughter‐in‐law in this story of hers about the phony movie corftract in New York.”\n\n“Love” is the first Hungarian film Miss Darvas has ever made. She is, however, a legend in Budapest, her reputation there being based solely on her theatrical career. “I started acting in 1921, my first role was Juliet. I met Molnar two years later when I was rehearsing in his ‘Heavenly and Earthly Love.’ He called me ‘Miss Meteor’ because I had such a quick success and he predicted I would fall soon after. We were married in 1926—he was 24 years older than I—and the marriage lasted until his death 26 years later. [Molnar wrote many of his plays for her—“Riviera,” “Delilah,” “Mima,” “Still Life,” “Olympia.”] I was exclusively a Hungarian actress until 1925. Then I left because my last season there I played five plays and in all five I was bad. So I thought, ‘That's that.’\n\n“Reinhardt had sent for me, so I studied German and for the next thirteen years I was exclusively a German actress. I played in his theaters in Vienna, Berlin, Salzburg, and touring all over Europe from Vilna, Poland, down to Rome. Then every year or two I would go back to Budapest for guest appearances.”\n\nReinhardt, the most influential director on the Continent, known as “the great magician,” had five theaters in Berlin, two in Vienna and two in Salzburg. His companies played the international repertory, Shakespeare, Shaw (Miss Darvas was the Aviatrix In a 1928‐29 Berlin production of “Misalliance” that included a pert young Marlene Dietrich), Schiller, Tolstoi, Goldoni, Molnar, Maugham. In 1927, Gilbert Miller, backed by Otto H. Kahn, brought the Reinhardt company to New York, an awesome star ensemble that included, besides Miss Darvas, Alexander Moissi, Helene, Hermann and Hans Thimig (the Barrymores of Europe), Arnold Korff, Vladimir Sokoloff, Harald Kreutzberg, Tilly Losch. They did seven plays. Miss Darvas appeared in six of the seven, opening Night's Dream” at the old Century Theater.\n\nMolnar also came over, his first time in America. His “Liliom” had been one of the Theatre Guild's earliest successes and be had just scored ah even greater hit with “The Play's the Thing.”\n\n“That was based on me,” said Miss Darvas of “The Play's the Thing.” “Molnar was sitting with a friend in our rooms at the Imperial Hotel in Vienna and from the bedroom they both heard me playing a love scene with some man. The friend thought it was a disastrous situation but Molnar enjoyed it—he knew his own text and he knew I was rehearsing a comedy of his. That gave him the idea for ‘The Play's the Thing.’ Thirteen years later, on March 11, 1938, the Germans ma ched into Vienna and were quartered in that same hotel and that was when I marched, out. Like B.C. and A.D., my life is BeHitler Hitler.”\n\nShe arrived in New York in July of that year, and found herself one of a group of such noted actor‐refugees as Fritzi Massary, the Viennese operetta queen, Hans Jaray, Oscar Kariweis, Fritz Kortner, Oscar Homolka. Walter Slezak, then playing in “I Married An Angel,” got her a tutor so she could learn English. “It was very hard for us who had been stars in Europe to keep repeating, ‘She, we, they, us, she, we, they, us.’\n\n“Then, finally, three years later, I opened in Bruckner's ‘The Criminals,’ directed by Piscator...on Pearl. Harbor Day, and of course no one was in the mood for serious theater and we soon closed. The reviews said about me, ‘Welcome among the American stars’ and I thought, ‘This is it,’ and then I waited for the offers to come. And I waited — for three more years. When I first came here in repertory with Reinhardt, I thought, ‘Those poor American actors who have to play one part for a whole year.’ Little did I know that some years later I would be dying to get a hit that ran a year.”\n\nHer next play was Rose Franken's “Soldier's Wife,” which starred Martha Scott — and ran almost a year. After it, she played Gertrude in the Maurice Evans G. I. production of “Hamlet,” and a celebrated European actress, based superficially on herself, in “Bravo,” by George S. Kaufman and Edna Ferber (“a drama about the poignant plight of some Eastern Europeans in New York,” wrote Brooks Atkinson. “Obviously, Miss Darvas knows more about it than any of us. She has been through it.”)"
