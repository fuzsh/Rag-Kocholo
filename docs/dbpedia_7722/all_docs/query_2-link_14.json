She played in Kecskemét for Miklós Mariházy, in Sopron (from 1920) and in Pécs (1923-24) under the contract of directors László Asszonyi and György Kürthy. Here she had great success in the title role of Tökmag, which she played 22 times in one season. She also appeared in The Three Graces and In the Sun. In 1922 she became a member of the National Association of Actors[and later joined the company of Aladár Miklósy (1925-26), who later became her first husband. They married on 31 August 1924 in Kispest. She was a member of the Municipal Theatre (1926-27), where she was a soubrette primadonna in the song play Legend of Balaton and primadonna in Cseregyerek. She was also a member of the Újpest Theatre (1927-29) and the Kisfaludy Theatre in Óbuda (1929-30). She then performed in the company of Sándor Iván (1930-31).
