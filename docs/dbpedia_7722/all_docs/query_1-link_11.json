The Society of Jesus first settled in Hungary in 1561 during the period of Ottoman conquest.

The independent Hungarian Jesuit Province was established in 1909. The totalitarian regimes of the twentieth century, however, posed fresh challenges.

        "text": "2.1 The Founding Father: Archbishop Nicolaus Olahus and the First College of Trnava\n\nDefeat at the Battle of Mohács was a stake through the heart for the medieval Kingdom of Hungary. Civil war broke out, and the Ottoman Empire was able to take control of the central region of the fallen kingdom without having to face any substantial resistance. This was a devastating shock to diverse strata of society. Many of the Catholic prelates had perished on the battlefield, and this was a major blow to the church as an institution. The primate, Archbishop of Esztergom László Szalkai (1475–1526, in office 1524–1526), was among the dead. Reformation ideas, which had been spreading since the early 1520s, offered a promising response to the social crisis and, partly as a consequence of the new upheavals, began to gain even greater popularity. The new archbishop, Pál Várday (1483–1549, in office 1526–1549), held several synods and tried to use legal measures to curb the influence of the Reformation, but with little success.10\n\nIn 1553, Nicolaus Olahus (1493–1568), who was the nephew of King Matthias I (1443–1490, r.1458–1490) and a prominent humanist of his time, was appointed archbishop (in office 1553–1568). In 1526, before the Battle of Mohács, he had served as secretary to King Louis II (1506–1526, r.1516–1526) and his wife, Queen Mary of Austria (1505–1558). After Louis II died on the battlefield in 1526, Olahus accompanied Mary to the Low Countries. Here, he came into contact with Western European humanist intellectuals, including Erasmus (1466–1536). He returned to Hungary in 1542, where he became a high priest and was increasingly engaged in political affairs. He also campaigned against the Reformation and pursued a comprehensive reform of church practices, in parallel with the Council of Trent (1545–1563), which was being held at the time.11 His primary models were probably the reforms introduced by the diocese of Vienna and the archdiocese of Salzburg. He introduced his ideas first in the new seat of the archdiocese of Esztergom. After Esztergom came under Ottoman occupation in 1543, Trnava was made the new seat of the archdiocese. Archbishop Olahus united the local town and chapter schools in Trnava, and he introduced new statutes to raise the educational standards. These measures included the reform and strengthening of the chapter of the archbishopric, which had also been relocated to Trnava. In 1558, he held a diocesan synod, which adopted a constitution of forty-four points (this was one of the first important documents in the reform of the Hungarian Catholic Church). In order to put the synod’s provisions into practice, the archdeacons carried out church visitations between 1559 and 1562. The surviving sources from the time clearly show the decline of the Catholic ecclesiastical structure. Instead of the 550 parishes that had existed in the Middle Ages, only three hundred parishes had Catholic priests, and the sources indicate 159 married priests among the clergy, but only twenty-nine had been declared heretics. In the wake of the observations that were made during the visitations, Archbishop Olahus held four more diocesan synods and, in 1561, a provincial synod. In 1566, he founded a diocesan seminary for ten students to facilitate the training of priests.12\n\nThis reform process included the settlement of the Jesuits in Hungary. The archbishop, who had been serving at the time as Hungarian chancellor, had already met the Jesuit Claude Le Jay (1504–1552) at the imperial diet in Worms in 1545. He had been so impressed by Le Jay’s sermon that he had asked him for a copy.13 King Ferdinand I (1503–1564, r.1526–1564) was also devoting more and more serious consideration to the possibility of settling Jesuits in Vienna. In the autumn of 1550, he approached Le Jay and expressed his desire to found a college for the Society in Vienna.14 The emperor held Le Jay in particularly high esteem, so when he founded the Jesuit house in Vienna, he specifically asked Ignatius of Loyola (c.1491–1556), co-founder of the Society of Jesus and its first superior general (in office 1541–1556), to appoint Le Jay to serve as its head. This was the first Jesuit settlement in the Holy Roman Empire. New houses for the Society were also founded in the emerging Habsburg monarchy in Central Europe, such as the one in Prague, Bohemia, which was established in 1556. These “northern” houses were under the direct control of Ignatius until 1556. It was at this time that the Jesuit province of Germania Superior was created, with Peter Canisius (1521–1597) as its first provincial superior. Six years later, however, the organization of the Society was changed again. The Habsburg territories (Austria, Bohemia, the Kingdom of Hungary) were separated from the Upper German province, and then, with the addition of Poland and Lithuania to these territories, the Austrian province was created in 1562.15\n\nThese were the organizational frameworks within which Archbishop Olahus was able to begin settling members of the Society of Jesus in Hungary. In 1552, Ferdinand I’s envoy in Rome was already discussing the possible establishment of three houses in Hungary with Ignatius. The following year, after having become archbishop, Olahus immediately contacted Canisius and the Jesuit rector in Vienna, Nicolas de Lanoy (1548–1581). The geographical location of Trnava (the archbishop’s seat) and the archbishop’s stable financial position made a good impression, but the increasingly ominous advances made by the Ottomans delayed the issue of establishing a presence in Hungary for a time. The Society opted instead for the city of Prague.16\n\nThe settlement of Jesuits in Hungary became particularly important for the archbishop after the school reform of 1554 in Trnava. During his frequent stays in Vienna, Olahus had ample opportunity to see the effective work of the Jesuits. Concrete negotiations, however, did not begin until 1558. The archbishop discussed the question with Father Juan de Vitoria (d.1578), rector of Vienna, who in 1553 became the first Jesuit to visit Hungary. The negotiations were long and complicated. Financial issues were the primary obstacle. Ferdinand I issued the founding charter on January 1, 1561, and by that summer, the Jesuits were able to move into the building that had been purchased for them.17\n\nJohannes Seidel (1532–1570) became the first rector, and the school opened in the autumn, despite the lack of suitable buildings. Seidel soon came into conflict with the chapter, however. The students were unable to attend Masses at the chapter because of their schedules at the school, and the canons complained of this to the archbishop. Olahus confronted the Jesuits, and the dispute became more acrimonious. At one point, in one of his sermons, Seidel brashly insulted Canon Miklós Telegdy (1535–1586), the city’s parish priest. The leadership of the Upper German province had no choice but hastily to recall the rector from Trnava. Also, an outbreak of plague decimated the college. Three priests perished, including Canisius’s nephew Theodor (c.1542–1562). By the time the new rector, Hurtado Pérez (1526–1594), arrived, most of the staff at the college had been replaced.18\n\nThis fluctuation remained a problem in the following years. The college existed for seven years, and during this period, forty-six Jesuits were active in Trnava. Eleven of them were born in Hungary, but only four were of Hungarian nationality. The others did not know the languages that were used in the multi- ethnic region and thus, apart from their teaching, were only able to play a limited role as pastors.19 Péter Hernáth (c.1539–1567), referred to as Petrus Hungarus by his colleagues, stood out among the first generation of Hungarian-born members of the Society. He was born near Pécs, the wealthy episcopal seat, but his family had had to flee because of the Ottoman advances. He had pursued studies in Vienna, where he had applied for admission to the Society, and he had been sent to Rome with the support of Canisius. He soon excelled among his peers because of his talents, and he was given the chance to teach logic and theology at the University of Dillingen. In 1566, hoping to resolve the conflict between the Jesuits of Trnava and the chapter of Esztergom, the leaders of the Society appointed him to serve as rector.20 Hernáth’s arrival on the scene came too late, however. In 1567, a fire broke out in the city, destroying the college. The rector died of the plague in the same year. In the end, the Society decided to close the college in Trnava and summon the Jesuits back from Hungary.21\n\nThe failure to found a stable institution in Trnava had valuable lessons for all involved. The Society’s leaders saw confirmed their earlier fears that overly hasty attempts would undoubtedly flounder. Perhaps the most significant disadvantage was simply the lack of a secure financial basis. The archbishop and the king had donated various goods and estates to the college but in vain. The damage caused by Ottoman incursions and the misuse of various assets by the inspectors of the estates had seriously undermined the financial foundations of the endeavor. The Society, therefore, adopted a more cautious approach in its future dealings, insisting on adequate guarantees for any plans for a new foundation in Hungary. The archbishop also learned a valuable lesson from the events in Trnava. His primary goal, apart from the foundation of the school, had been to invigorate Catholic religious life in the city. This would have then provided a suitable basis for a more comprehensive process of re-Catholicization as a next step. This was hampered, however, by the Jesuits’ lack of knowledge of the languages of the region and also by the fact that there were, quite simply, very few Hungarian priests among them.\n\nDespite these obstacles, both the leadership of the Society and the Hungarian Catholic Church remained interested in the idea of establishing a Jesuit presence and pursuing missionary opportunities in Hungary. Trnava would have served as a kind of outpost for the Jesuits in Vienna and thus also as a springboard for further expansion to the south and east.22 For the next three centuries, the city, which by the mid-sixteenth century had become the seat of the archbishopric, continued to play a central role in the Jesuits’ institutional network within Hungary. The main goal continued to be to strengthen the Catholic Church and its organization, which had been eroded by the Reformation, with the help of the Jesuits. The establishment of the Society in Vienna had been an important step in this direction, since, as the center of the Habsburg monarchy, the imperial capital had a strong influence on the Hungarian regions close to it, including Trnava. Vienna thus also became a bastion of Jesuit expansion to the east.23 The central role it would come to play was not necessarily immediately obvious in the mid-sixteenth century. Soon, another alternative for expansion of the Society of Jesus in Hungary arose in the north, through Transylvania, with Poland serving as an intermediary.\n\n2.2 A Polish Alternative? Foundations by King Stephan Báthory\n\nThe civil war that broke out after 1526 between the two elected kings, Ferdinand I and John Zápolya (János Szapolyai [1487–1540, r.1526–1540]), drove another wedge into the territorial unity of the medieval Hungarian state. On August 29, 1541, roughly a year after Zápolya’s death, Buda, the ancient capital, also fell into Ottoman hands. The widowed Queen Isabella (1519–1559) and her infant son, John II Sigismund (János Zsigmond [1540–1571]), were allowed to travel to the eastern region of the country by permission of Sultan Suleiman (c.1494–1566, r.1520–1566). Thus began three decades of dispute and rivalry between Zápolya’s heir and the Habsburgs, a struggle that involved political, military, and diplomatic means. The dispute would have been brought to an end by the Treaty of Speyer in 1571, which essentially became the founding document of the Principality of Transylvania. However, John II had died when the treaty was being ratified, and the situation became uncertain again. In the end, Stephen Báthory (István Báthory [1533–1586]), the scion of an old noble family, emerged triumphant from the Transylvanian party struggles and, as the successor to John II, was elected voivode (in office 1571–1576). His political position was somewhat precarious at the outset, but he secured his claim to power by defeating his opponents at the Battle of Sânpaul (Kerelőszentpál in Hungarian) in 1575. He eliminated all internal opposition, and his position was further strengthened by his election as king of Poland (r.1576–1586) in the same year.24\n\nThe election of Báthory, a Catholic, was a serious turning point, since the situation of Catholicism in the emerging Principality of Transylvania was more precarious than in the Habsburg-ruled Kingdom of Hungary. In 1556, the Transylvanian diet secularized the possessions of the Catholic Church, and Bishop Pál Bornemissza (1499–1579) was banished from the lands of the principality. The following year, another diet secularized the chapters and monasteries.25 The notion that, in 1568, the Transylvanian diet of Turda (Torda in Hungarian) proclaimed equality among the various denominations has been repeated seemingly innumerable times in the secondary literature, but as has been all too often overlooked, the Catholics were in fact left out of this. Two years earlier, the Catholic clergy had already been banned from Transylvania by the diet. In the end, the right of Catholics to practice their religion freely was only put into law in 1595.26\n\nBy the 1570s, the spread of Reformation ideas had broken the Catholic hierarchy in Transylvania. The remnants of this hierarchy retreated to some areas of the Székely Land (first and foremost to Scaunul Ciuc [Csíkszék in Hungarian], an area lying in the northern valley of the Olt River and one of the historical Székely seats) and the estates of a few Catholic members of the nobility. The Catholic Stephen Báthory broke with the ecclesiastical policy of John Sigismund, who had been moving ever closer to Antitrinitarianism. Báthory’s goal was to strengthen the Catholic Church, and he was counting on the help he might receive from the Jesuits. This only became a realistic possibility, however, after he had gained the Polish throne. During the first half of his reign (1571–1579), Báthory showed remarkable and, indeed, unusual patience when it came to religious issues, partly because he sought to consolidate his rule and partly because of the strength of the Protestant Transylvanian estates. Although he condemned Calvinist and Antitrinitarian tendencies, he considered religion fundamentally a question of the individual’s freedom of conscience. Nonetheless, the laws passed by the Protestant estates in Transylvania affirmed Báthory’s “limited tolerance.”27\n\nNegotiations between Báthory and the Jesuits began immediately after Báthory’s election. The new ruler had met members of the Society in Vienna a few years earlier. The Hungarian Jesuit István Szántó (Arator) (1540–1612), who later came to play an important role, welcomed Báthory’s election, and he himself pressed for the establishment of a Jesuit mission, at least on the Báthory estates. In the following years, Szántó made no effort to avoid conflicts in his strivings to further the cause of bringing Jesuits to the principality and facilitating missionary work. Báthory wrote to the Austrian provincial superior Lorenzo Maggio (c.1531–1605, in office as provincial superior of Austria 1566–1578) to ask him to send missionaries. However, the relatively fresh memory of the failed attempt in Trnava prompted the Jesuits in Vienna to exercise caution.28 There were also tensions between Báthory and the Habsburgs because of Báthory’s election to the Polish throne. Under the circumstances, the Austrian Jesuit province understandably did not dare attempt to organize a mission in Transylvania, since the Viennese court would never have looked favorably on such an undertaking.29 The settlement of Jesuits in Transylvania was also hindered by the Holy See’s reluctance to recognize Báthory’s rule in Poland out of consideration for Emperor Maximilian II (1527–76, r.1564–1576), whose candidature had been rejected by the Polish nobility. Recognition by the Holy See came only after the emperor’s death on October 12, 1576.30\n\nBy that time, the prefects of the Society were also leaning toward establishing a Jesuit presence in Transylvania, not from the direction of the Austrian province but rather from the Polish one. The Jesuits had settled in Poland during the reign of Sigismund II Augustus (1520–1572, r.1548–1572), the last Jagiellonian monarch, at the invitation of Cardinal Stanisław Hozius, bishop of Warmia (1504–1579, in office 1551–1579). The first college was founded in Braniewo, followed by several others over the course of the following years. At the time, the Polish houses were part of the Austrian province, but they formed a separate Polish vice-province.31 The rapid development of the network of colleges made it necessary to create an independent Polish province in 1574.32\n\nWhen Báthory was elected Polish king, he knew he could rely on the support of an independent Polish province to implement his plans for Transylvania. Vilnius University, which was one of Báthory’s most important Jesuit foundations in Poland, became the model for a later Transylvanian experiment. In 1568, the bishop of Vilnius Valerian Protasevičius (1504–1579, in office 1556–1579) created a burse for the establishment of a Jesuit college, which opened its doors two years later, in 1570. Instruction in philosophy (1571) was gradually complemented by mathematics (1574) and theology (1578). Báthory issued the royal charter in 1578, and this was soon followed by papal confirmation. On October 30, 1579, Pope Gregory XIII (1502–1585, r.1572–1585) issued his bull Dum attenta, which conferred papal privileges on the new university.33\n\nIn the meantime, Szántó, who was active as a confessor in Rome, continued to keep the issue of settling Jesuits in Transylvania on the agenda. After Báthory became king of Poland, he entrusted his brother Christopher Báthory (Kristóf Báthory [1530–1581]) with the task of governing Transylvania as voivode (in office 1576–1581). Szántó wrote a letter to the new Polish king and Christopher Báthory. Stephen Báthory supported his plan and asked his brother to facilitate the settlement of Jesuits in the cities of Alba Iulia (Gyulafehérvár in Hungarian) and Cluj-Mănăştur (Kolozsmonostor in Hungarian). The Báthory brothers, however, continued to dally. Szántó did achieve some modest successes in Rome. He managed to have two Hungarian Jesuits, János Leleszi (c.1548–1595) and György Tőrös (c.1544–1586), transferred to Vienna, from where they had the opportunity to pursue missions in Hungary and Transylvania. In the end, Leleszi broke the deadlock by taking a rather bold step. He traveled without the permission of his superiors from Upper Hungary to Alba Iulia, the seat of the Principality of Transylvania. By doing so, he furthered the settlement of Jesuits in Transylvania, because Stephen Báthory ordered his brother to have the Jesuits settled in Cluj-Mănăştur.34\n\nBáthory had learned an important lesson from the uncertainties of the early 1570s, however. Given the reluctance his plans met with in the Austrian province, he sought the help of Polish provincial superior Francisco Sunyer (c.1532–1580, in office 1575–1580). The first Polish Jesuits arrived at the former Benedictine abbey of Cluj-Mănăştur in the autumn of 1579. This attempt by the Báthory brothers seems to have been more successful than the efforts to settle Jesuits in Trnava, the laws restricting the Catholic Church in Transylvania notwithstanding. Less than two years later, Jesuits were able to move into the city of Cluj (Kolozsvár in Hungarian), where they were given the renovated building of the former Franciscan friary.35\n\nThough Cluj was not the seat of the principality, it was undoubtedly the most important city in Transylvania. It was an important center for trade and had a strong cultural influence. Once they were allowed to move into the city, the Jesuits immediately opened their school, which soon became a successful alternative to the city’s Unitarian school. The number of students at the Jesuit school consistently ranged between 150 and two hundred. A seminary for priests was opened in 1583, and in 1585 higher education was launched with the creation of a faculty of philosophy.36 Whether the institution in Cluj should actually be considered a university is the subject of an old debate in the secondary literature. As it so happens, Báthory did not request papal privileges for the school in Cluj, as had been done in the case of Vilnius. According to more recent research, the Cluj school was one of the so-called “academic grammar schools.”37\n\nCluj was also important in the history of the Jesuits in Hungary because it is the first place where records are found concerning the creation of the Marian congregation, which had not been possible in Trnava. By 1582, the congregation definitely existed, alongside the Jesuit College of Cluj, to which the most talented students were admitted. Many of the city’s denizens also attended the Masses and services held by the congregation. Considerably more important than this, however, was the fact that the generation of Jesuits who would later determine the development of the Society in Hungary in the first half of the seventeenth century grew out of the circle of Transylvanian students who belonged to the Marian congregation.38 Thus, one could hardly call into question the cultural influence of the Jesuit College of Cluj. It continued to function, with short interruptions, until 1603, and it unquestionably contributed significantly to the strengthening and survival of Catholicism in Transylvania.\n\nIn addition to Cluj, there were two other places in the Transylvanian Principality where Jesuits were active. A smaller community with ten members was established next to the princely court in Alba Iulia. This was an important step, since the seat of the principality had had a strong Protestant character under the reign of John Sigismund. Voivode Christopher Báthory broke with this when he wanted to ensure that his son Sigismund Báthory (1572–1613) would get a Jesuit education. It is worth keeping in mind, just as an illustration of the complexity of the confessional situation at the time, that the voivode’s wife was a Calvinist who was very much opposed to the idea of her son getting a Catholic education. In the afternoons, she would have a Calvinist pastor meet with Sigismund to explain to him why the Jesuit teachings were false. The Jesuits were given the buildings of the former Dominican monastery and church in Alba Iulia. They opened a public school in the city that in 1585 had almost one hundred students.39 All this suggested that there would soon be dramatic changes in the confessional relations in the seat of the principality.\n\nIn 1571, the Treaty of Speyer gave several Hungarian border counties to Transylvania. This was the region known as Partium. One of the most important cities in this region was Oradea (Várad in Hungarian), the old episcopal see and burial place of Saint Ladislaus I of Hungary (1040–1095), the medieval Hungarian king (r.1077–1095) known from legends as the knight-king. Although the Catholic Church was compelled, in accordance with Transylvanian law, to withdraw from the city, with the exception of a few years, the local Catholic community had always had a parish priest. Given its geographical location in the border region between the Kingdom of Hungary, Transylvania, and the Ottoman Empire, Oradea enjoyed considerable influence, so in the first half of the 1580s the Society supported the establishment of a mission in the city, which was led by Szántó for four years. In 1584, the Catholics of Oradea wrote to Superior General Claudio Acquaviva (1543–1615, in office 1581–1615) and asked him to secure a Jesuit mission in the city for them. Thanks to its geographical position, the city met the hopes that had been pinned on it. Szántó conducted missions not only in the surrounding region but even in the distant cities of Caransebeş (Karánsebes in Hungarian) and Lugoj (Lugos in Hungarian), which were under Ottoman rule at the time.40\n\nIn 1586, however, the Jesuits suffered several heavy blows. An outbreak of plague in the principality that summer killed twenty-four of the forty-five Transylvanian Jesuits. Although the Polish province quickly replaced the members who had perished, the previously intensive work began to flag. The most devastating blow, however, came at the end of the year. On December 13, Stephen Báthory died in Grodno (today in western Belarus). This loss of a patron who had been a pillar for the Society was soon felt. The background to the settlement of Jesuits in Transylvania revealed that, as had been the case in Trnava, the conditions were simply not adequate for long-term operations. In addition to the necessary financial foundations, the essential political backing was also lacking, as the turn of events after the death of Báthory made all too plain.41 The Hungarian Jesuits in Transylvania also found it increasingly difficult to cooperate with the Polish province. Szántó, for instance, who had been one of the most active promoters of the Jesuit presence in Transylvania, came into serious conflict with Jakub Wujek (c.1541–1597), the Polish rector of the college in Cluj. Wujek complained repeatedly about Szántó’s allegedly unmanageable character and the way he conducted himself in his dealings with the Polish superiors. Szántó had similar complaints about Wujek. In 1581, he sent a letter directly to Superior General Acquaviva in which he wrote of his bitter experiences with the Polish province. He asked Acquaviva to remove Wujek and, more generally, to take Transylvania out from under the Polish Jesuit administration. He also asked Acquaviva and, through him, the Austrian provincial superior Maggio to send members of the Austrian province to Transylvania instead.42 In the end, the fate of the Transylvanian Jesuit mission (Missio Transylvanica) was sealed when Báthory’s heirs, having taken the political constellation into consideration, felt compelled at least temporarily to withdraw their support for the Jesuits.\n\n2.3 Modest Hopes: Kláštor pod Znievom and Šaľa\n\nThe failed undertaking in Trnava and the Transylvanian–Polish alternative definitely kept the question of settling the Jesuits afloat in the Habsburg-ruled part of the country too. This was due in no small part to Szántó’s assiduous efforts to keep the Hungarian cause on the agenda in Rome. In 1575, Szántó became a Hungarian confessor in Rome, where, thanks to the initiatives of Pope Gregory XIII, national colleges were being established one after the other. In 1578, in the hope of winning the support of the Holy See for the establishment of a Hungarian college, Szántó put together a memorandum titled De Collegio Hungarico in urbe excitando libellus (A booklet on the foundation of the Hungarian College in Rome). Szántó saw the college as an important tool in the revival of Catholicism in Hungary and the continued struggle against the spread of Reformation ideas. Szántó was already cautioning at the time against sending newly arrived Hungarian students to the Collegium Germanicum. The origins of his opposition to the Habsburgs and the German nation (natio Germanica) may have lain simply in the fact that, at that time, he was Stephen Báthory’s protégé. In the end, having succeeded in winning the support of some of the cardinals, Pope Gregory XIII issued the founding bull of the Collegium Hungaricum on March 1, 1579. However, unsettled questions concerning the properties involved and the small number of students caused problems from the outset. The pope decided that year to merge the Collegium Germanicum and the Collegium Hungaricum.43 Báthory later attempted to exert his influence in Rome through his nephew, András Báthory (1563–1599), and persuade the Holy See to make the Hungarian institution separate again, but his efforts were in vain.44\n\nFrom the 1570s on, parallel with the attempts in Rome and Transylvania, plans were constantly being hatched to ask the Jesuits to return to Hungary. In 1575, Superior General Everard Mercurian (1514–1580, in office 1573–1580) was informed by Vienna that a canon of Esztergom (not mentioned by name) had invited the Jesuits to return to Trnava, presumably to hold a mission.45 The Jesuit Antonio Possevino (1533–1611), who had been entrusted by the pope to work in Central Europe, made a six-week tour of Transylvania and Upper Hungary. Possevino met with the Hungarian prelates in Bratislava (Pozsony in Hungarian, Preßburg in German) and suggested that the Jesuits be invited to return. He felt that the territory and estates of the medieval Premonstratensian priory of Turiec (Turóc in Hungarian), which at the time were in the possession of bishops, would provide suitable land for a Jesuit settlement, as well as the necessary foundation for financial stability. These lands were also an ideal place for a Jesuit settlement, in Possevino’s assessment, because they were equidistant from Kraków, Vienna, and the Ottomans.46\n\nPossevino’s proposal eventually found a supporter in Cardinal György Draskovich, archbishop of Kalocsa (1515–1587). Draskovich had one of the most successful careers of his time as a prominent figure of the church. He was the scion of an old noble family in Slavonia and the nephew of Cardinal George Martinuzzi (or György Fráter [1482–1551]), and therefore enjoyed a thorough education abroad. He became bishop of Pécs in 1557 and, from 1561, took part in the Council of Trent as an envoy of Ferdinand I, where he played an active role in several debates and supported proposals for reforms. Upon returning home, he was appointed bishop of Zagreb, then archbishop of Kalocsa (1573) and bishop of Győr (1578), and eventually cardinal (1585). Both as bishop of Zagreb and Győr, Draskovich played a major role in implementing the reforms of the Council of Trent in Hungary.47\n\nThe recall of the Jesuits to the Kingdom of Hungary was an important element in Draskovich’s reform activities. In 1586, the cardinal managed to convince Rudolf I (1552–1612, r.1576–1608) to give the priory of Turiec to the Jesuits. Superior General Acquaviva, however, delayed the establishment of the college for several reasons. He viewed the future of the foundation as uncertain due to the peripheral location of its estates and the problems that could potentially arise with regard to their administration. Furthermore, he was concerned by the lack of spry Hungarian Jesuits who would be able to adapt to the distinctive conditions of the country and work effectively. The Jesuits in Vienna, who were temporarily overseeing the royal endowment, feared that, given the obvious uncertainties troubling the center in Rome, the estates would eventually end up in the hands of other figures of the church. The priory had two centers: Kláštor pod Znievom (Znióváralja in Hungarian) and Šaľa (Vágsellye in Hungarian).48 Initially, temporary missions were led here, but in 1588 a permanent mission was created that was subordinate to the College of Vienna. Joannes Nicolaus Donius (c.1538–1594), the former rector in Vienna who had experience with Hungarian affairs, was appointed prefect in Kláštor pod Znievom. By 1591, the institution had been given the status of a college, and two years later, it was functioning as a full-fledged grammar school. The Jesuits grappled with numerous obstacles, however. First and foremost, Gábor Révay (d.1598), the Lutheran lord lieutenant of Turóc County, strove to hinder them in their work. The Society made considerable efforts to establish good relations with Révay, even going so far as to perform a play in his honor, but in vain. In 1592, the college was attacked and its library destroyed. The county’s assembly forbade noble youths from studying at the Jesuit grammar school, and they also forbade the serfs from attending Catholic Masses and sermons. At the diet held in 1599, the Protestant estates even pushed through a law that would have taken the Turiec priory away from the Jesuits, but Rudolf I refused to sign it.49\n\nThough the Jesuits were not overly unsettled or discouraged by these attacks, in 1598, they still moved the college to Šaľa, as it had a more favorable location. When the Society had taken possession of Šaľa in 1586, Donius noted that the modest town had no city walls and the houses were comparatively simple. Šaľa did enjoy broad judicial privileges, however, which were enforced by a local court consisting of a few members of the nobility with some knowledge of the law. After the Jesuits had been installed, they found themselves embroiled in lengthy legal battles with the local nobility and freemen (so-called “libertinus”). The fathers accused the local smallholders of having illegally acquired land that had belonged to the estates of the priory. By 1599, the Jesuits had won the lawsuits and had also purchased other estates.50\n\nThere were no more than some eight to twelve Jesuit priests working in the two houses at any given time, and most of them still did not know and did not bother to learn Hungarian, and they presumably also did not know much if any Slovak, another important language in the region. Kláštor pod Znievom and Šaľa were only of peripheral significance and had, at most, a small, local influence.51 A school was opened beside the college in Šaľa, which had more positive long-term effects, however. When Spanish priest Emmanuel Vega (c.1550–1640), who had served as the prefect of the Marian congregation in Cluj, left Transylvania in 1587, many of his fellow young priests did the same and entered the Society of Jesus. One of them was Sándor Dobokay (1565–1621), who, as a rector of the church in Šaľa, founded the local Marian congregation. Although there are very few sources concerning this local congregation, some prominent members of the church were definitely honorary members, including Ferenc Forgách, bishop of Nitra (Nyitra in Hungarian [1560–1615, in office 1596–1607]) at the time. The future cardinal-archbishop Forgách may even have served as the honorary president (praesul) of the congregation, as suggested by the fact that, in 1604, he arranged for the Šaľa congregation to join the Prima Primaria, the main congregation in Rome, which oversaw the entire network.52\n\nVery few sources have survived concerning the functioning of the school in the subsequent years, but we do know that many noblemen who later came to play influential roles studied there. The most prominent among them was Miklós Esterházy (1583–1645), who served as palatine of Hungary between 1625 and 1645. As palatine, Esterházy was the highest dignitary of the kingdom and one of the most important advocates of the Society of Jesus in the early seventeenth century. Many members of families who belonged to the lesser nobility were also able to pursue studies at the school in Šaľa, and they later invited Jesuits to hold missions on their estates, which was an important step in the strengthening of Catholicism in the region.53\n\n2.4 On the Brink of Exile\n\nIn 1581, after the death of his brother Christopher, the childless Stephen Báthory made Christopher’s underage son Sigismund his heir in Transylvania. When Báthory died at the end of 1586, Sigismund Báthory, who was still a minor, became the new prince. This led to political volatility, as various parties competed for influence over the young prince. In this increasingly tense situation, the Jesuits in Transylvania became easy targets and scapegoats.54 They were the focus of attention in no small part because, since the late 1570s, they had been Sigismund’s tutors at the princely court in Alba Iulia.\n\nThe Protestant estates in Transylvania made every effort to undo the results of Báthory’s Catholic restoration. The nobility, in exchange for recognition of Sigismund as an adult, forced the exile of the Jesuits. Similarly problematic for the Society was the fact that, between 1586 and 1588, the other members of the Báthory dynasty were not unequivocal in their support for the Jesuits. Sigismund’s cousin, Cardinal Andrew Báthory (1563–1599), bishop of Warmia (1589–1599), played a particularly important role in this respect. His relationship with the Jesuits had significantly cooled. Understandably, it was more important for the family to maintain power than to risk civil war, and the Society’s expulsion seemed an acceptable sacrifice.55 Cardinal Báthory, of course, also blamed the Jesuits. Many of the young students who had left Cluj with Vega in 1587 had joined the novitiate in Kraków without the permission of their families. The cardinal claimed that this had been a fatal mistake, which turned public sentiment in Transylvania even more against the Society.56\n\nIn 1588, the diet of Mediaş (Medgyes in Hungarian) banished the Jesuits from Transylvania, a decision that the young Sigismund Báthory had no choice but to approve. Pope Sixtus V (1521–1590, r.1585–1590) responded by putting the principality under interdict, though he later gave the prince permission to have confessors at his court in Alba Iulia to whom members of the Catholic fold could turn for confession and Communion. His cousin, Cardinal Andrew Báthory, acted as a mediator between Sigismund and the Holy See in an attempt to convince the latter that the young prince was acting under political duress. Sigismund did all he could to get the Society of Jesus back as soon as possible, but neither the Austrian nor the Polish province showed much enthusiasm. The Austrians were wary because of the anti-German sentiments among the Transylvanian Jesuits, and the Poles had not forgotten the tensions that had arisen in the 1580s between the Hungarian and Polish Jesuits in Transylvania. In the end, the Austrian Jesuits accepted the task. Leleszi was appointed head of the Transylvanian mission, but this was little more than a formality, as Leleszi was by then an elderly bedridden man residing in Vienna. The return of the Society was, in fact, prepared by the Spanish Alfonso Carrillo (1553–1618), who traveled to the principality in 1591 for this purpose.57 With the help of Superior General Acquaviva, Carrillo was granted broad prerogatives by the Holy See. He was able to consecrate churches, hold Mass several times a day, grant the children of heretical parents who hoped to enter the priesthood exemptions and bless mixed marriages.58\n\nIt would have been possible, soon after Carrillo’s arrival, to have resettled the Jesuits in Transylvania. The Báthory family, which had again managed to consolidate its hold on power, presumably would have been able to assert its will at the Transylvanian diet. It was precisely Prince Sigismund’s cousins, however, who thwarted the Jesuits’ aims. Having failed to realize his aspirations at the diet, Carrillo bitterly remarked of Cardinal Andrew Báthory that he “wished he had never come here from Poland.” To avoid further tensions, Carrillo ordered the Jesuits in Transylvania to stop wearing the garb of the Society and to dress as secular priests.59\n\nIn the 1590s, Transylvania found itself in an increasingly tumultuous domestic political crisis, aggravated by the decision of Prince Sigismund to join the war against the Ottoman Empire as an ally of the Habsburgs. This led to internal party struggles in the prince’s court between those who supported the Habsburg war effort and those who would have preferred to maintain peaceful ties with the Porte. Ultimately, the pro-Habsburg side prevailed, and Sigismund Báthory settled scores with pro-Ottoman politicians, even going so far as to have one of his own cousins executed in 1594. To seal the alliance between Transylvania and the Habsburgs, Sigismund married Rudolf I’s niece, Archduchess Maria Christina (1574–1621). He thus managed at least temporarily to consolidate his hold on power, which he used to strengthen the position of Catholicism. In 1595, the diet of Alba Iulia put into law the free practice of the Catholic religion.60 The diet also agreed to allow the Jesuits to pursue their work in the principality in Cluj-Mănăştur, Cluj, and Alba Iulia. The last years of the sixteenth century, however, were nothing like the comparably peaceful 1580s. After 1598, the principality was gradually falling into anarchy, and the Society withdrew for the most part to the cities, which offered more promise of stability. Under the circumstances, it was virtually impossible to pursue missionary work.61\n\nIn 1599, when Prince Sigismund abdicated due to the deteriorating political situation, Cardinal Andrew Báthory took over the country for a short time. Michael II the Brave (Mihai Viteazul [1558–1601]), the voivode of Wallachia (in office 1593–1601), soon invaded the country and defeated the cardinal, who was killed while attempting to flee. Transylvania then fell under Habsburg rule for a few years, governed by General Giorgio Basta (1550–1607, in office 1601–1604) on behalf of Rudolf I. Though he was only in power for three years, Basta’s name remains a synonym for despotic rule in Transylvanian history.62\n\nUnder the tumultuous circumstances, Basta also counted on the Jesuits as a means with which to pacify the principality, which was on the verge of anarchy. In 1601, with the help of Michael II the Brave, Basta defeated Prince Sigismund, who had returned to attempt to reclaim the throne, at the Battle of Guruslău (Goroszló in Hungarian). After the battle, the invading armies seized Alba Iulia, where the Jesuit house stood defenseless. The fathers were only able to leave the city thanks to Basta’s intervention, but the college was pillaged. Basta was inclined to support the Jesuits, and in 1602 he confirmed the colleges of Alba Iulia and Cluj by a letter of donation. The situation in Cluj, however, was increasingly tense because of the refugees streaming in from all parts of the principality. The city was struggling with a shortage of supplies, and the Jesuit rector was not willing to share the college’s grain reserves, even after repeated requests. An enraged mob broke into the college and murdered Father Emmanuel Neri (c.1575–1603). The other priests were spared by local burghers. The Austrian province appointed Giovanni Argenti (1560–1629) as the new rector of the Cluj college and also as deputy provincial superior. A surviving report issued by Argenti reveals that, after 1603, the Jesuits of Cluj strove to strike a sustainable balance in the grave political situation. They stood up for the city against the excesses of the military government, and they began teaching again. Soon, they had some 260 students in three classes.63\n\nThe prolonged war, the policies adopted by the Habsburg court toward Transylvania and Hungary, and the aggressive efforts by the Catholic Church to push Counter-Reformation ideas and practices soon generated serious tensions in the broad strata of society. The anti-Habsburg movement was led by Stephen Bocskai (1557–1606), a Calvinist and Sigismund Báthory’s maternal uncle. In 1604–1606, Bocskai secured his hold on power in Upper Hungary with a series of military successes, even capturing the city of Košice (Kassa in Hungarian), which was the administrative and ecclesiastical seat of the region. He was elected prince of Transylvania in 1605 (in office 1605–1606), and in 1606 he managed to press Rudolf I into making considerable concessions in the Peace of Vienna. And in the meantime, the Peace of Zsitvatorok brought the Fifteen Years War, or the Long Turkish War (1591–1606), to an end.64\n\nThe Bocskai uprising also had serious implications for the Jesuits, both in Transylvania and in Habsburg Hungary. At the Transylvanian diet, Bocskai tried twice to have the Jesuits expelled from Transylvania, but this time, the Transylvanian estates refused. Their hesitancy may seem surprising, given the precedents, but it was also understandable. They were hardly fond of the Society of Jesus, but the twists and turns in the war against the Ottomans and the years of anarchy in Transylvania had convinced them to show some degree of caution. They did not yet dare to make an open display of their dislike for the Society, which, after all, enjoyed the support of the Habsburgs. The town council of Cluj also did not demand the expulsion of the fathers. It only insisted on the return of the properties they had been given. This accorded with the article of the Peace of Vienna regarding the Jesuits, which did not explicitly proclaim the expulsion of the Jesuits but merely declared that the order was not entitled to possess properties. Thus, the Society was not allowed to own any properties in the cities, any estates, or any other assets or form of property that would have been necessary for it to function. In the end, the political consolidation that came in the wake of the Peace of Vienna and the Peace of Zsitvatorok brought an end to the legal presence of the Jesuits as an active religious order in Transylvania. In 1607, having accurately discerned the shifting constellation of power, the Transylvanian diet proclaimed the expulsion—again—of the Jesuits from the principality.65\n\nThe two Jesuit communities in Hungary, however, had met their fate in 1605. Bocskai’s Hajduks pushed as far as Lower Hungary, forcing the Jesuits to flee both Kláštor pod Znievom and Šaľa. The destruction of their house in Kláštor pod Znievom was of symbolic importance. Szántó, who had been the defining figure, as a Jesuit priest in the period between 1570 and 1600, was active in Kláštor pod Znievom as a homilist at that time. Of his impressive literary work, he was able to save only the manuscripts of his translations of the Quran when he was forced to flee. Most of his writings—the result of some four decades of work—fell victim to fire. The broken old Jesuit escaped to Moravia, and in 1612, he died in Olomouc.66\n\n3.1 The Jesuit Archbishop: Cardinal Péter Pázmány and the Strengthening of the Society\n\nThe expulsion of the Transylvanian and Hungarian Jesuits did not constitute a complete rupture in the history of the Society in Hungary. It was precisely in these years (1602–1607) that the Society settled in the Croatian city of Zagreb. The Kingdom of Croatia had been in a personal union with the Kingdom of Hungary since the Middle Ages, and this union survived within the new framework provided by the Habsburg monarchy. Each of the two kingdoms exerted a strong cultural and political influence on the other, and this mutual interaction was also important in the field of religious life. Croatia had remained a faithful member of the Catholic fold throughout the tumultuous sixteenth century, and the Reformation had had little lasting effect in the kingdom. The success story of the creation of a Jesuit settlement in Zagreb has nonetheless remained a little-known chapter in the history of the Jesuits in Hungary. One reason for this is the manner in which the two nations later came to drift apart and even came to face each other on the battlefield by the mid-nineteenth century, as well as the successful foundation of Jesuit communities and institutions in Hungary. And yet the first foundation of a Jesuit college that was a lasting success took place in the Croatian capital, which was also an important administrative and ecclesiastical seat at the time. In the story of the settlement of Jesuits in Zagreb, a familiar family name appears. János Draskovich (c.1550–1613), the Croatian ban (a kind of viceroy, in office 1595–1606) who invited the Society to the Croatian capital, was the nephew of Cardinal György Draskovich, who had supported the settlement of Jesuits in Kláštor pod Znievom. The founding of the college in Zagreb has been largely neglected in the later Hungarian secondary literature, though it was unquestionably a significant event for the Jesuits of Hungary at the time, and it formed an integral part of their identity.67\n\nThe founding of the Jesuit college in Zagreb was a close continuation of the sixteenth-century antecedents. There was internal ecclesiastical and legal discord and strife in the city at the turn of the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries, and the city council feared that these conflicts posed a threat to the pastoral care for the burghers of the Croatian capital. When the Zagreb envoys attended the diet in Bratislava in 1601, they met Ivan Zanič (c.1561–1607), the Croatian-born superior of the Jesuit house in Kláštor pod Znievom. The envoys turned to him for help and requested that two Jesuits be sent to Zagreb. It was Zanič who interceded and passed on the request from Zagreb to Carrillo. Carrillo, who had played an important role in Transylvania, was serving as an Austrian provincial superior at the time. Over the course of the next few years, negotiations of varying intensity were held, and on October 28, 1606, Zanič and another young Jesuit began working actively in Zagreb, where they soon opened a school. The Jesuit residence in Zagreb gradually grew stronger, and in 1612 it was elevated to the status of a college.68 Zanič was a kind of symbolic link between the two centuries: he was the last prefect in Kláštor pod Znievom before its destruction and the first prefect in Zagreb.\n\nThe active role played by the Croatian ban, János Draskovich, in the foundation of Zagreb also made very clear that the question of the settlement of Jesuits was no longer an “internal” matter for the Catholic Church. Rather, it was an issue that was increasingly being taken up by lay aristocrats. This was a sign that ever more nobles were returning to the Catholic faith, a shift in which the Jesuits had considerable influence. Thus, from the early seventeenth century onward, the two processes increasingly reinforced each other. This was also important because the provisions of the Peace of Vienna, which had brought the Bocskai uprising to a formal end, had seemingly pushed the Catholic Church in Hungary, including the Jesuits, to the brink of collapse. In principle, the peace treaty in 1606 and the subsequent legislation in 1608 made it almost impossible to establish new Jesuit colleges from a legal point of view, as they prevented the Society from receiving donations of land in Hungary. Once peace had been reached, however, the political framework was more stable, and this made it possible for the Catholic Church to develop new strategies and dexterously adapt to the circumstances.69 This all fitted well against the backdrop of the Catholic revival, a process that was taking place throughout the century. One of the most prominent figures of this period was the Jesuit Péter Pázmány (1570–1637), who rose to the highest position in the Hungarian Catholic Church, the archbishop of Esztergom, in 1616.\n\nPázmány, a scion of a Calvinist noble family, began his studies at the Jesuit grammar school in Cluj in the early 1580s. He was still but a teenager when he converted to Catholicism. He was one of the young students who followed Vega to Hungary in 1587, and he began his novitiate in Kraków the following year. He continued his philosophical studies in Vienna, where he became friends with Wilhelm Lamormaini (1570–1648), the future confessor to Emperor Ferdinand II (1578–1637, r.1619–1637). He then pursued theological studies in Rome, and in 1597 he became professor of philosophy in Graz. The University of Graz became one of the centers from which the Jesuits expanded their influence into Hungary. Between 1586 and 1640, some four hundred young Hungarian Jesuits studied there.70\n\nIn the early seventeenth century, Pázmány worked for a few years in the Jesuit house in Šaľa and the associated mission in Košice. Košice was the seat of government in Upper Hungary: it was home to the Chamber of Szepes and a military command headquarters. The town also became the seat of the diocese of Eger in these years, after Eger had been captured by the Ottomans. Košice, however, was one of the Lutheran strongholds in Hungary, and Pázmány’s mission thus fit well into the larger efforts of the Catholic Church to reestablish itself in the city. István Szuhay (1551–1608, in office 1598–1608), the bishop of Eger, briefly occupied the main church in the city in 1604, but this only strengthened local opposition to the Catholic Church.71\n\nIn 1607, Pázmány became the confessor, advisor, and confidant of Cardinal Forgách, archbishop of Esztergom (1607–1615). Cardinal Forgách very deliberately invited Jesuits to his courts in Trnava and Bratislava as preachers and confessors. From the outset, he was planning on building on this mission and reestablishing a Jesuit college in the Kingdom of Hungary. Half a century after the first failed attempt, Trnava, the seat of the archbishops, was again chosen as the most suitable site to establish a Jesuit community. In 1613, as a prerequisite for the foundation of the college, Matthias II (1557–1619, r.1608–1619) donated the priory of Turiec and its estates to the archbishop of Esztergom. This step was a shrewd means of sidestepping the 1608 laws, according to which the Jesuits were not entitled to own property. Cardinal Forgách subsequently appointed Pázmány to oversee the priory of Turiec.72 In October 1615, the new college in Trnava was finally opened. As it so happens, however, Archbishop Forgách died only a few days later.\n\nAlthough the vow he had taken as a Jesuit and the Hungarian anti-Jesuit laws did not make Pázmány’s situation any easier, with the verbal consent of Pope Paul V (1550–1621, r.1605–1621) and the support of Superior General Muzio Vitelleschi (1563–1645, in office 1615–1645), he became archbishop of Esztergom in 1616, and later cardinal in 1629. Over the course of the period of two decades during which he served as archbishop (1616–1637), he mobilized enormous energies for the Catholic revival in Hungary in the spirit of the Council of Trent.73 The founding of the University of Trnava in 1635 was one of the highlights of the renewal process. The University of Graz, where Pázmány was previously a professor, served as a model. He may well have hoped to have founded the university considerably earlier, but the material and personal resources were only available toward the end of his life. Pázmány had several important supporters in this effort. The Hungarian György Forró (1571–1641, in office 1630–1634) was the provincial superior of the Austrian province at the time. Forró had been a classmate of Pázmány’s in Cluj, and they had entered the novitiate in Kraków together. György Dobronoki (1588–1649), one of the key figures in the early seventeenth-century boom of founding colleges in Hungary, served as rector in Trnava.74 Pázmány also had an important ally at the Viennese court in Lamormaini, the Jesuit confessor to Ferdinand II. The foundation of the university was confirmed by Ferdinand II on October 18, 1635. Although Pázmány hoped to have it confirmed by the pope, Urban VIII (1568–1644, r.1623–1644) refused to give his consent, as the institution had neither a faculty of law nor a faculty of medicine and was therefore only an incomplete university. In the background, however, lay the conflict between the pope and Pázmány, the origins of which most probably stretched back to his diplomatic mission to Rome in 1632.75 Pázmány died within a mere two years of the foundation of the university.\n\nIn addition to the colleges in Zagreb and Trnava, a third important Jesuit college was founded in the early seventeenth century. The founding of the college in Humenné (Homonna in Hungarian) also enjoyed the support of the local landlord, György Drugeth (1583–1620). He was also a convert, having become a Catholic at the Jesuit college in Prague in 1600 or 1601. He had begun welcoming Jesuit missionaries to his court as early as 1601, and he often provided refuge for Jesuits during the Bocskai Uprising. According to later sources, it was then that the idea of founding a college occurred to him. In 1608, two Jesuits arrived in Humenné to set up a permanent missionary station. With Drugeth’s support, a proposal was also made to establish a residence. The number of Jesuits in the Drugeth court increased, although until 1614, their presence was referred to only as a mission in the annual catalogs. By then, the Jesuits had opened their school, the church had been taken from the Calvinists, the Calvinist preacher had been expelled, and the town had been re-Catholicized. The missionaries from Humenné also began to become active in Košice again, where, with the support of Zsigmond Forgách (c.1565–1621), chief justice of the kingdom (1610–1618) and the chief captain of Upper Hungary (in office 1611–1618; he was also the brother of Cardinal-Archbishop Ferenc Forgách), they restored the abandoned chapel in the so-called “royal house.”\n\nNegotiations concerning the establishment of the college in Humenné were already well underway. The residence and school building were built at Drugeth’s expense, and he provided additional land and income. The negotiations were led by Dobokay, who had been one of Pázmány’s classmates in Cluj and was serving as rector of Zagreb at that time. The charter was finally issued on July 2, 1615. Since, according to the 1608 laws, Drugeth was also not allowed to donate property directly to the Jesuits, he created a foundation, the income from which he gave to the college. The quick development of the college in Humenné was also facilitated by the many Catholic noblemen who followed Drugeth’s example and made generous donations in support of the new institution.76\n\nThus, by 1616, three major Jesuit colleges were active: in Zagreb in the Kingdom of Croatia, in Trnava in Lower Hungary, and in Humenné in Upper Hungary. These were the three centers from which dozens of missions and new colleges later grew. The period between 1610 and 1630, which bore witness to the foundation of a wave of colleges, was followed by quieter decades, but in the 1670s, there was another flurry of new institutions as a consequence of the violent Counter-Reformation. Although there was no single recipe according to which Jesuit communities were successfully founded, the endeavors undertaken in the first half of the seventeenth century had numerous important affinities. While aristocrats were among the founders, the prelates remained the main driving force behind the creation of Jesuit communities. It was thanks to their preparatory measures that the first properties were acquired and the foundations necessary for vibrant institutional life organized. They also played an important role in dismantling the opposition. This opposition came in part from the Protestant town leaders, who were definitely hostile to the Jesuit presence, but it also came from the local diocesan chapters, who were fearful of any threat to their rights and prerogatives. The bishops also gained the support of the monarch and the superior general for the creation of new institutions. By the 1620s, however, there were already many Hungarian Jesuits who were perfectly able to conduct the necessary local negotiations on behalf of the Society. This sometimes took several years, of course, since, given their earlier experiences, the leaders of the Society did not want to make any hasty decisions.77\n\nIn the 1670s, Jesuit expansion gained new momentum thanks to an aggressive Counter-Reformation campaign that had the full support of the Habsburg government. Feeling more clearly the looming threat of the Ottoman Empire at its doorstep and having grappled with an anti-Habsburg conspiracy, the Viennese court introduced harsh measures against Protestants: the expulsion of preachers, the seizure of churches, and the replacement of Lutheran city councils by Catholic ones.78 In 1674, for example, a Jesuit mission was launched in Baia Mare (Nagybánya in Hungarian) even though there were virtually no Catholics living in the city. In these situations, the Jesuits could only count on the support of the diocese, the imperial military, and the organs of regional government. This was true for practically all the Jesuit communities that were established in the 1670s.79\n\nIn the seventeenth century, temporary missions were set up in many places, which in some cases evolved into permanent missions or even developed further within the Jesuit institutional structure. However, because of the Transylvanian–Habsburg or the Ottoman wars and the anti-Habsburg uprisings that flared up from time to time, they were often unable to function without disruptions and interruptions, so it is difficult to offer any kind of coherent narrative or summary of their individual development. By the last third of the century, however, the network of Jesuit communities had spread throughout the country, reaching into Transylvania and the Ottoman Empire.\n\nThe country was jarred by three major anti-Habsburg campaigns and uprisings, causing moments of upheaval that deeply touched the Jesuit institutional network. Gabriel Bethlen (1580–1629), prince of Transylvania (1613–1629), led a successful campaign against Ferdinand II between 1619 and 1621. The Humenné college was destroyed, and even the Jesuits of Trnava fled to Vienna. From the perspective of Jesuit identity and memory culture, however, the events that took place in Košice were to prove the most decisive. In 1619, there were two Jesuit missionaries serving in the city, Melchior Grodziecki (c.1584–1619), who was of Silesian origin, and István Pongrácz (c.1582–1619) from Transylvania. At the news of the approach of the Transylvanian troops, a canon from the chapter of Esztergom, Márk Kőrösi (c.1589–1619), who was in the area at the time, also fled to Košice. In early September 1619, Košice was surrounded by the Transylvanian armies, and under pressure from the Lutheran burghers, the imperial captain surrendered the city within a few days. The three Catholic priests were immediately arrested and imprisoned. They were not allowed to have any contact with their parishioners and were not even given food and water. Immediately after their arrest, they were ordered to convert to Calvinism, but they refused. On the evening of September 6, in the presence of some representatives of the city council, the Hajduks attacked the priests. After the priests had been brutally beaten, they were again called on to convert. According to testimony given later, Pongrácz was mutilated, and his body was burned with a torch. Kőrös was beheaded, and Grodziecki was beaten in the head with swords until he died; his corpse was later beheaded. Pongrácz’s tormentors continued to torture him. They sought to obtain details concerning an alleged Catholic conspiracy against the prince. After having tortured him to the point that they believed he had died, they threw the three bodies into a sewage pit and covered them with debris. Pongrácz, however, had not died, and he suffered for several more hours. Witnesses testified to having heard his moans of agony. The bodies were buried the next day in a cellar with the help of the town executioner. One year later, at the request of Countess Katalin Pálffy (1590–1639), widow of Palatine Zsigmond Forgách, Prince Bethlen handed over the bodies because, according to an anecdote, the countess had agreed to dance with him at a celebration in Košice. The martyrs of Košice were beatified in 1905, and in 1995, Pope John Paul II (1920–2005, r.1978–2005) elevated them to the rank of saints. The three martyrs have become patron saints of both the Hungarian and Slovak Jesuit provinces.80\n\nIn 1644–1645, Prince George I Rákóczi (1593–1648, r.1630–1648), Bethlen’s successor, launched a campaign against the Habsburgs. The war and the plague epidemic that came with it caused further disruptions in the Jesuit college network. The college of Győr, for instance, was decimated by the plague outbreak, with thirteen Jesuits dying in the space of two years. In contrast with Győr, the entire college in Bratislava fled.81 The Jesuit residence that had returned to Humenné was forced to flee again. Count János Drugeth (1609–1645), the founder György Drugeth’s son, learned from experience and had the Jesuits resettled in 1646, not to Humenné, but to the more protected city of Uzhhorod (Ungvár in Hungarian).82\n\nThe Humenné/Uzhhorod college was intended to serve as the headquarters of the Catholic Church in Upper Hungary, but because of its precarious situation, it was ultimately unsuitable for this role. In the mid-seventeenth century, however, large-scale building work began in Košice, which was the seat of the diocese of Eger. In 1650, with the support of the bishop and the king, the Jesuits succeeded in opening a school, which soon grew into an academy. It was granted the same privileges as the university in Trnava, with a faculty of philosophy and a faculty of theology, and opened its gates in 1660. In 1665, a new diocesan seminary also came under Jesuit management. The Jesuits of Košice played a leading role in the theological debates in Upper Hungary in the 1660s, which also gave rise to considerable literary activity. The efforts undertaken in the 1670s to establish missions and residences in Upper Hungary (which became important bastions of the Counter-Reformation) were also launched out of Košice.\n\nBut this momentum was shattered by the third major Protestant uprising. The Counter-Reformation and the attempts by the Habsburgs to establish absolutist rule drove many Protestants to flee to Transylvania or to territories under Ottoman occupation. These refugees, led by the Lutheran count Imre Thököly (1657–1705), launched a successful attack against the Habsburgs in the late 1670s. By 1682, Thököly had managed to establish an Ottoman vassal principality in Upper Hungary. The Jesuits were a prime target for Thököly and his Protestant supporters, so almost all the communities that had been established in the 1670s were forced to flee. The Jesuits also fled Košice, and the academy was unable to resume normal operations for a good decade. Only after Thököly’s fall in 1685 were the Jesuits able to resume their activities in Upper Hungary.83\n\nThe appearance of new institutions responsible for ensuring that the next generation of Jesuits would be trained marked the strengthening of the Jesuit network in Hungary. In 1655, the first Hungarian Jesuit novitiate was opened in Trenčín (Trencsén in Hungarian). It was founded by György Lippay (1600–1666), archbishop of Esztergom (1642–1666), who had already created a foundation for this purpose in 1651. In the period leading up to the dissolution of the Society in 1773, 1,723 scholastics and 707 coadjutor novitiates had begun their studies there.84 The third probation within the Austrian province took place from 1633 onward in Judenburg in Carinthia. In 1668, however, an attempt was made to establish a house of probation in Győr, in the Hungarian half of the province’s vast territory. However, it was only in operation for two years.85\n\nThe strengthening of the institutional structure was clear evidence of the successful and enduring establishment of the Society of Jesus in the territory of the Kingdom of Hungary. This institutional network had survived the upheavals of the seventeenth century. Thanks to its stable background, it was able to recover quickly from the temporary disruptions caused by the wars.\n\n3.2 In the Pull of the Unknown: Ottoman-Hungary and Transylvania\n\nThe idea of sending missions to territories of the Ottoman Empire (the so-called “Missio Turcica”) had been raised by the first Jesuits, but for a long time the implementation of any such plan remained questionable. Jesuits had already arrived in Ottoman territories from Transylvania and Dalmatia in the sixteenth century and had been treated with openness and goodwill by the Ottoman authorities. Three main conditions were lacking for the continuation of any mission, however: (1) an adequate number of Jesuit priests with the necessary language skills, (2) a stable base that could serve as a point of departure, and (3) at least some support from the remaining local church structures. By the beginning of the seventeenth century, these preconditions were beginning to be met.86 In the regions under Ottoman occupation, a parallel mission— church structure had been established. A gradual movement toward organization from the south, mainly Dalmatia, was under the control of Rome. As far as it concerned the Jesuit missionaries, this southern branch was under the control of the Jesuit province of Rome. In the north, the church hierarchy in the Kingdom of Hungary had also built up its own organization in the territories under Ottoman occupation. The Jesuit missionaries coming from this direction belonged to the Austrian province.\n\nBoth structures rested heavily on religious orders, and the Society of Jesus played an important role in this. The Jesuits settled in Belgrade in 1612 within the framework of the southern branch, under the direct control of the superior general. The Jesuits, however, almost immediately came into conflict with the Bosnian Franciscans, who feared that the Jesuits might pose a threat to their positions and influence. A conflict broke out over who had jurisdiction over the chapel in Belgrade; however, there was a much more serious economic fight in the background about the control of trade between Bosnian merchants and Dalmatian merchants from Ragusa. By 1632, Jesuit activities in Belgrade had come to an end.87\n\nOut of the Belgrade mission grew a Jesuit mission in Timişoara (Temesvár in Hungarian). The mission here was established in 1613, providing pastoral care to the Catholics who lived in the city and its surroundings. When the Belgrade mission ceased operations, the Jesuits moved their missionary headquarters there, with the superior general sending additional fathers from the Roman province. According to one report, most of the denizens of the city were Muslims or Orthodox, with fewer than five hundred Catholics living among them. Several villages in the surrounding area were Catholic, however, and accommodations were provided for the Jesuits in these settlements. The Jesuit missionaries, who depended on the modest support provided by the merchants of Ragusa, lived under well-nigh squalid conditions. To save the Timişoara mission, in 1643 Superior General Vitelleschi had it annexed to the Austrian province. He assumed that it would be easier to provide both additional Jesuit fathers and necessary financial support from Vienna. The step, however, did not prove adequate to save the mission. The Jesuits were only able to work effectively in the city and its immediate surroundings, and only in a rather limited way. The Catholics in the region did not want to hear anything about the reforms in Trent, the observance of the rules of marriage, or the new calendar. Finally, in 1653, both the Austrian province and the superior general decided to shut down the mission in Timişoara.88\n\nAt the same time as the efforts were underway to establish an enduring Jesuit presence in Belgrade, missions were also being launched from the Austrian province. The mission to Pécs, established in 1612, was of particular importance. The Jesuit residence in Zagreb provided the institutional support for this undertaking. Gergely Vásárhelyi (c.1560–1623), the superior of the Zagreb residence, began to inform himself about the potential for establishing Jesuit missions in the territories under Ottoman occupation. At the local level, Don Simone Matković (c.1575–1638/1639), a parish priest of Bosnian origin, tried to get help from Rome. Eventually, the Austrian provincial superior was instructed by Superior General Acquaviva to send Vásárhelyi and another Croatian-speaking Jesuit priest to Pécs. The Jesuits maintained an active presence in Pécs, if with brief interruptions, from then on until the suppression of the Society.89\n\nNew mission stations were established in Gyöngyös in the north in 1633 and in Andocs on the southern shore of Lake Balaton in 1642. Andocs and Pécs were put under the jurisdiction of the Győr college in 1647. These undertakings were successful in part because the local Jesuit leadership in Vienna and the Roman center also steered the Hungarian Jesuits toward the mission in the territories under Ottoman occupation. They strove to cool the fervor of Jesuit fathers who were eager to embark on missions overseas by assuring them that undertaking missionary work in the Ottoman Empire was every bit as challenging as preaching to pagan peoples in places like Japan, Brazil, or the English colonies in Virginia.90\n\nThe Jesuits of Pécs were involved in education from the outset, but they achieved only modest results, with only thirty or forty pupils. The principal reason for this was presumably because, in Pécs, the Jesuits did not take adequate precautions to avoid attracting the attention of the authorities. The city, after all, was an Ottoman administrative and military sub-center. The history of the school building itself offers a telling illustration of this. In 1622, the Jesuit superior in Pécs had an ostentatious, Italian-style building constructed next to the Jesuit church that was to serve as the school. The Ottomans occupied the building the very night the Jesuits moved in. The next day, the superior lodged a complaint with the Ottoman judge (the kadi), but perhaps not surprisingly, the judge sided with the Turkish soldiers and did not return the building.91\n\nIn part because of the challenges faced by the Jesuits in Pécs (and their missteps), the city of Gyöngyös, found in the northeast, in the Ottoman–Hungarian border zone, ultimately became a center of Jesuit schooling in the regions under Ottoman occupation. Gyöngyös was also the only such center to develop into a residence during the Ottoman period, which offers another sign of its importance. The Jesuits opened the school there in 1634, and within roughly a decade, it had evolved into a complete grammar school, including a rhetoric class. The school was immensely popular, with an average of two hundred to three hundred students. It was thus only barely smaller than the school in Győr, which had some three hundred to four hundred students and was one of the largest grammar schools in the Kingdom of Hungary. From the perspective of its operations, the Gyöngyös school did not differ in any meaningful way from the schools in regions under Christian rule. Sources from the period between 1644 and 1679 offer evidence of numerous school plays, most of which were dramatizations of stories from the Old and New Testaments. In 1679, for example, students even performed a play based on the story of Saint Ladislaus I of Hungary. A Marian congregation was also established for the students in 1644, becoming the first baroque religious society in the territories under Ottoman occupation. From the outset, it extended beyond the walls of the school and included members of the city’s intelligentsia. Compared to other Jesuit schools, the only difference was perhaps the rigid austerity with which discipline was enforced. This was understandable, however, since the slightest instances of misconduct by the students would give the local Lutheran minority a pretext to complain to the Ottomans about the Jesuits.92\n\nThe Belgrade mission also played a major role in the return of the Jesuits to Transylvania. This was thanks in part to a fruitful personal relationship. István Szini (c.1580–1645), a Jesuit of Transylvanian origins, was one of the first members of the Belgrade mission. As a child, he had been one of the future Calvinist prince Gábor Bethlen’s classmates. In 1619, Bethlen’s soldiers had brutally murdered the Jesuit missionaries in Košice, and yet this same prince, himself a fervent Protestant, had a member of the Society recalled to Alba Iulia. Szini remained one of the main pillars of the Transylvanian mission until his death in 1645. Soon, the Jesuit missionaries were not only able to work actively alongside the prince’s court but had also reestablished themselves in the settlement of Cluj-Mănăştur, and a new mission station was created in Caransebeş. The Jesuits opened a school there too, the success of which is indicated perhaps most clearly by the simple fact that, in addition to people from the surrounding settlements, even merchants from Wallachia and Bulgaria sent their children to study at it. Members of the large Romanian Orthodox population living in the area around Caransebeş made concerted efforts to prepare for union with the Catholic Church. One important step in this direction and one of the clear signs of the importance of the mission in Caransebeş from the perspective of literary history was the translation of Canisius’s Catechismus minor into Romanian by György Bujtul (1591–1635), a member of the mission. Bujtul’s translation became such an influential text that in the early eighteenth century, when the issue of the possible unification of the Romanian Orthodox Church with the Catholic Church was again being discussed, the catechism he translated was reprinted. Bujtul’s translation of the catechism became one of the most important pieces of seventeenth-century Romanian literature.93\n\nIn the eastern borderlands of Transylvania, in the so-called Székely Land (which enjoyed a special legal status), a more significant Catholic community survived even after the waves of the Reformation. In the 1590s, Jesuit missionaries from the Principality of Moldavia and the more central areas of Transylvania came to the Székely Land, but no permanent Jesuit presence was established. In 1648, István Milley (1610–1677), the leader of the Transylvanian mission, drew attention to the importance of settling Jesuits in the Székely Land. Two years later, the influential Jesuit Mátyás Sámbár (1618–1685) arrived as part of the mission to the Székely Land (Missio Siculica), which was based in Odorheiu Secuiesc (Székelyudvarhely in Hungarian). It was important, however, to keep the fact that he was a Jesuit a secret, though given his agile personality, this cannot have been easy. The Catholic communities in the Székely Land were run mainly by laypeople (so-called licentiates, who were licensed to perform certain ecclesiastical activities), and there was a Franciscan cloister in Șumuleu Ciuc (Csíksomlyó in Hungarian). The reforms that had been adopted by the Council of Trent were of little interest to the few remaining Catholic priests, most of whom had wives. The notion of church discipline was a tattered veil at best, and fornication, inebriation on feast days, dancing, markets during Mass, breaking the fast, and violations of marriage rules were common. Sámbár began instructing children in the teachings of the faith with great fervor and established a schedule for feast days and the taking of the sacraments. He also preached regularly and organized the annual Corpus Christi processions. Sámbár even opened a grammar school where small plays were performed, although the leadership of the Society felt that the time had not yet come for such a bold step. The Austrian province maintained the Missio Siculica in later years, even under the most difficult circumstances. In 1702, the mission in Odorheiu Secuiesc became a residence, and together with its grammar school, it remained an important center of Catholic life in the Székely Land until the Society’s dissolution.94\n\nThe efforts and successes of the Society of Jesus in Transylvania were greatly influenced by the Society’s relationships with the Protestant Transylvanian princes, however. Prince Gabriel Bethlen adopted a comparatively tolerant policy, but his successors were less receptive. During the reign of György I Rákóczi, it became increasingly difficult for members of the Society to pursue their work because of the unsettled legal framework and growing antipathy. New missionaries were not allowed to settle in the principality, and the mission in Caransebeş was shut down. His son, György II Rákóczi (1621–1660 r.1648–1660), was even more hostile to the Jesuits, and in 1652–53 he again banned them from the principality by law. The missionaries, however, found ways to circumvent the law. Only the most prominent members of the Society, such as the aforementioned Sámbár, actually left. The others continued to pursue their activities as secular priests, working in disguise and using aliases.95\n\nThe Transylvanian mission was connected in several complex ways to the Moldovan mission. The fathers who had been expelled from Transylvania in 1588 came to Iași, the capital of Moldavia, for a few years at the invitation of Moldavian prince Petru VI Şchiopul (1537–1594, r.1582–1591). They were not successful in their work, however, and they were soon recalled. In the 1640s, an attempt was again made to consolidate a Moldavian mission from the direction of the Austrian province.96\n\nThe Jesuit missions in Transylvania and the territories under Ottoman occupation played an important role in strengthening local Catholic communities in the region. Although these missionary structures collapsed during the Great Turkish War (1683–1699), the knowledge gained of circumstances on the ground later proved crucial. After the Ottomans had been expelled from the region and the Principality of Transylvania had been brought under Habsburg rule, the Jesuit institutional network gradually developed there, too, building on the earlier missionary stations.\n\n3.3 The Struggle for an Independent Hungarian Province\n\nWith the gradual expansion of the institutional structure, the Jesuit houses in Hungary became increasingly important within the Austrian province. This was due in part to the formation of an independent Bohemian province in 1623, which meant that the houses there separated from the Austrian province. This was also the first period during which several of the Austrian provincial superiors were from the Hungarian crown lands: Gregorius Rumer (1570–1627, in office 1618–1623) was born in Báhoň (Báhony in Hungarian) near Trnava, Christophorus Dombrinus (c.1572–1631, in office 1627–1629) was from Zagreb, and György Forró (in office 1630–1634) was from Transylvania.\n\nThe situation of the Society of Jesus in Hungary was determined for a good century, however, by article 8 of the pre-coronation act of 1608. This article essentially put into law one of the points of the Peace of Vienna, which was concluded after the uprising led by István Bocskai. According to this article, Jesuits “shall have no permanent property or right to own land in Hungary.” This law thus made it impossible for the Society as a whole and for individual members to acquire property. The legal consequence of this was that the Society of Jesus was excluded from the estates of the country and thus had no representative in the Hungarian diet. The Jesuits got around this law by creating foundations for some of the houses, and these foundations were placed under the administration of a lord or a bishop. The Jesuits were given honorary titles such as provost or abbot, which, in principle, gave them the possibility for political participation.97 Several attempts were made over the course of the seventeenth century to break down these legal barriers, which were the major obstacle to the establishment of an independent Hungarian province.\n\nThe idea of an independent Hungarian province was first mentioned at the provincial congregation of 1649. The request, which was submitted to Rome, did not arrive at the most fortuitous moment. That very year, the general congregation had already decided, in response to a large number of similar requests, that action should be taken against those who campaigned with external support for or against the creation of an independent province. The Austrian provincial assembly attempted to justify its request with the claim that the province was too large, stretching from Passau in the west to Alba Iulia in Transylvania. There were over one thousand Jesuits in the Austrian province, but half of the houses were in the Kingdom of Hungary. The provincial superior was unable to travel to all the houses every year, and communication with the local superiors was difficult. The Austrian province, therefore, asked Rome to create a Hungarian vice-province, which, once it had gathered some strength, would then become independent. They repeated this request several times over the course of the following decades, and in 1655, they even drew up a map to show the geographical distances. At the same time, the creation of the novitiate of Trenčín was already a foregone conclusion. Superior General Goswin Nickel (1582–1664, in office 1652–1664) offered a reassuring response, acknowledging the difficulties and promising to keep the matter on the agenda. In 1659, Nickel did in fact ask the provincial superior Johann Berthold (1606–1673, in office 1658–1661) to consult with his advisors and other eminent Jesuits and arrive at a decision.98\n\nThe head of the Hungarian Catholic Church, Archbishop Lippay of Esztergom, was in favor of the establishment of an independent Hungarian province and made significant efforts to remove the various legal obstacles in the Hungarian diet. Much to his chagrin, in 1659, the Catholic aristocrats did not support the Jesuit cause. The reason for this was simple. The sons of noble families had begun to join the Society, and thus it was perfectly possible that their inheritances would fall into the hands of the Jesuits. This posed a threat to the noble estates, and so the 1608 law proclaiming the Jesuits ineligible to hold estates remained in force.99\n\nThis was not the only obstacle to the establishment of an independent Hungarian province, however. In addition to the legal prohibitions, ethnic conflicts also aggravated the situation. In 1659, Márton Palkovics (1607–1662), the rector of the college in Košice, openly accused Berthold, the provincial superior, in front of Superior General Nickel of discriminating against Hungarians. Berthold did indeed refuse to separate the province, but he did suggest someone who could serve as vice-provincial superior. The Austrian provincial superior proposed the Croatian-born Michael Sikuten (1608–1687), who was the rector in Graz, for this post. He noted that the Hungarians would definitely not like Sikuten, but he contended that they would not support anyone apart from Palkovics as vice-provincial superior. Under the leadership of Zakariás Trinckel (1602–1665), rector in Trnava, the Hungarians put together a memorandum. Trinckel provided a link between the effort to establish an independent Hungarian province and the political recognition of the Jesuits in Hungary, as he had served as confessor and advisor to Archbishop Lippay.\n\nIn his petition, Trinckel stressed that, elsewhere, a province the size of the Austrian one would have been divided into smaller administrative units long ago. Referring to his earlier experience as provincial superior (1652–1654), he argued that the problem was not merely one of geographical size. The Austrian province was inhabited by peoples who spoke so many different languages that the linguistic and cultural barriers among the Jesuits from these lands made it difficult to manage the Society’s affairs. He acknowledged the difficulties an independent Hungarian province would face, including the legal uncertainties, but he felt that the foundations attached to the Jesuit houses by aristocrats and prelates would provide an adequately stable, reliable framework. He rejected the idea that there were not enough Hungarian Jesuits, and indeed he emphasized that, considering the training they had been given, they were perfectly qualified to govern. He considered the idea of a vice-province that was dependent on Vienna a bad, inadequate solution.\n\nThe conflict between Palkovics and Berthold was not without precedent. There were also national tensions behind the linguistic and cultural barriers mentioned by Trinckel, and this was not unique to Hungarian–Austrian relations. Complaints had also been made by the college in Ljubljana (Laibach in German). The situation was only made worse when an anti-Habsburg uprising broke out in the Kingdom of Hungary in 1670,100 in which Hungarian Jesuits also voiced their opposition to Vienna’s politics. Superior General Giovanni Paolo Oliva (1600–1681, in office 1661–1681) repeatedly cautioned the Jesuits not to put themselves at risk by getting involved in public affairs. Pál Balassa (1644–1705), professor of rhetoric at the university in Trnava, was even dismissed from the Society after he gave his students an assignment that offered them an opportunity to express excessive patriotism. The students wrote essays in which they defended the rebels and made disparaging statements about the Habsburg monarch and the imperial military.\n\nThese tensions and contradictions strengthened the position of those within the Austrian province who opposed the creation of an independent Hungarian province. In 1678, the fathers who were at the head of the opposition, including Provincial Superior Nicolaus Avancinus (1612–1686, in office 1676–1680), wrote a detailed memorandum to the superior general. They criticized first and foremost the nationalistic, separatist, rebellious Hungarian ethos, which was, they contended, very much alive among the Hungarian Jesuits. They considered them “inferior” priests who found it difficult to live the disciplined life of a member of the Society of Jesus. They preferred to work in the courts of Hungarian aristocrats, where they could enjoy a life of worldly pleasures. According to Avancinus and his colleagues, this meant that an independent Hungarian province would be governed not by the Jesuits but by the Hungarian aristocrats. They also insisted that Emperor Leopold I (1640–1705, r.1657–1705) would never agree to divide the province in half. In the end, however, Superior General Oliva again rejected the request but with the stipulation that it should be considered again when the political situation was more promising.101\n\nThe question of an independent Hungarian province and, in connection with this, the legal recognition of the Society of Jesus in Hungary, was raised several times over the course of the eighteenth century. After 1683, however, with the expulsion of the Ottomans, this took place in a changed political context, as the lands of the Hungarian Holy Crown had again been united under one rule, the rule of the Habsburg House.\n\n3.4 Jesuit Everyday Life in Seventeenth-Century Hungary\n\nThe work of the Jesuits in Hungary as elsewhere was focused primarily on pastoral work and education. Their efforts in these two fields, however, had numerous influences and impacts on other areas of culture. Education took place within the system of the Society’s regulations. In Hungary, however, the five-grade grammar school prescribed by the Ratio studiorum (Plan of studies) was complemented with the addition of an introductory grade, the so-called “parvista” grade. This was intended to provide compensation for a lack of knowledge among pupils due to the inadequacies of the elementary schools. It thus formed a bridge between the lower schools and the standards set by the Jesuit institutions.102\n\nThe Catholic Church gave the schools a prominent role in the Catholicization of Protestant students, as the Jesuit school system offered a competitive alternative to the admittedly excellent education offered in Protestant schools. The Jesuits usually began pursuing work as teachers in cities in which there had already been municipal or chapter schools in the Middle Ages. In these milieus, the Jesuit institutions clearly represented a qualitative change. Jesuit grammar schools also managed to achieve rapid and lasting successes in areas in which the political circumstances would not have seemed favorable. One could mention the Jesuit schools in Gyöngyös during the period of Ottoman occupation, for instance, or the schools in Cluj in the heart of (largely Protestant) Transylvania. New research suggests that one should be cautious about drawing any far-reaching conclusions. The Jesuit grammar schools did not discriminate against their Protestant students, and thus, their conversion to Catholicism was not as widespread as has been assumed.103\n\nThe stable expansion of the Jesuit school network went hand in hand with the spread of congregations. Antecedents from the sixteenth century illustrated very clearly the importance of the congregations, that is, the young students who entered the Marian congregation in Cluj then became the leading Jesuit figures in the first half of the seventeenth century. Congregations were founded in several waves over the course of the seventeenth century. In the first of these waves, in addition to Zagreb, Trnava unsurprisingly played a decisive role. Here, as the school expanded, four student confraternities were created. Later, three more confraternities were founded for the burghers of the city as part of pastoral work. The latter were formed according to the three nationalities living in the town (for Hungarians: Holy Cross, 1622; for Germans: Annunciation of Our Lady, 1649; for Slovaks: Agonia Christi, 1660). The confraternities also typically became comparatively diverse, depending on the size of the city and the configuration of the local Jesuit institution. The formation of certain specific congregations was also linked to the urban backdrop. In Bratislava, for instance, which was the center of the country and home to the most important government offices, a special congregation was created for the “lords,” that is, members of the nobility who also held offices. Bratislava was also a distinctive case because, at the initiative of Archbishop Lippay of Esztergom, an Agonia Christi congregation was formed there as early as 1647. This was one year before Superior General Vincenzo Caraffa (1586–1649, in office 1646–1649) institutionalized this form of confraternity in the Society of Jesus. Lippay also managed to persuade the Jesuits to accept the leadership of the confraternity despite the fact that it was also open to women. Caraffa gave his consent with the provision that women could only be present for sermons in the church.104\n\nThe Jesuits’ literary program was also closely linked to their pastoral work. In this respect, too, the writings of Archbishop Pázmány, who is considered the father of Hungarian prose, were outstanding. Pázmány was particularly active as a writer in the wake of the religious debates with Protestants. His main work was the Igazságra vezérlő Kalauz (Guide to divine truth [1613]), into which he incorporated his earlier polemical writings. Pázmány’s criticisms of the ideas of Cambridge Puritan William Whitaker (1548–1595) offer ample testimony of his extensive knowledge of the religious debate literature of his time. In addition to his critiques of Protestant ideas, he also authored a refutation of the teachings of Islam in a work published in Graz in 1605.105 The Ottoman conquest naturally aroused interest in Islam. In addition to Pázmány, a late work by Szántó (who was discussed in some detail in chapter 2), which has survived in manuscript form, also merits mention. Though his Confutatio Alcorani (Refutation of the Qurʾan), written around 1610–1611, builds in many respects on medieval literary antecedents, Szántó nonetheless adopted a new approach in many respects. Many of the factual errors in his text, however, cast doubt on his actual knowledge of the Qurʾan.106\n\nIn the middle of the seventeenth century, polemical religious writing began to burgeon again among the Jesuits, especially with regard to the debates taking place in Upper Hungary and the city of Košice. These writings were at times crude, derisive, or even personal in tone. On the Jesuit side, Sámbár, mentioned earlier in connection with the Transylvanian missions, was one of the leading figures. The Jesuits also produced a remarkable quantity of sermon literature. Pázmány was again one of the most outstanding authors in this genre. A collection of his writings was published in 1636, containing all his sermons from the past three decades. György Káldi (1573–1634) was another prominent preacher at the time. Káldi’s Sunday and feast day sermons were published in a separate work, as were his sermons on the Ten Commandments.107 The first translation of the Catholic Bible into Hungarian, which was published in 1626 in two thousand copies, is attributed to Káldi. The suggestion has often been made, however, that Káldi was merely working from the manuscript of a translation by Szántó that has not survived.108 The Jesuit school theater moved on the borderline between literary work and education. Most of the Jesuit dramas were basically connected with church festivities, but they also featured figures from Hungarian history: Hungarian kings Saint Stephen (c.970–1038; r.997–1038) and Saint Ladislaus. Jesuit grammar school students were even invited to perform at purely secular events, for instance, at the wedding of Prince Francis I Rákóczi (1645–1676) and Ilona Zrínyi (1649–1703) in Sárospatak in 1666.109\n\nThe Jesuits placed immense emphasis on the regular and proper performance of the sacraments by the members of the fold. They, therefore, recommended weekly Holy Communion and regular confession. They also tried to make confession a personal matter and give it a pedagogical dimension. They endeavored to persuade those who confessed their sins irregularly and only selectively to make proper confession. The large number of the faithful who gave confession indicates that their approach to this sacrament was popular. According to the annual reports and the records kept in the Historia domus chronicles, the Jesuits welcomed an ever-greater number of worshippers (in the thousands) who took Holy Communion.\n\nJesuits often had close personal relationships with individual members of their fold, providing pastoral care for them over long periods of time, though this was true mainly for members of the social elite, since high priests and aristocrats were able to have confessors in their courts. This all took place within the framework of the spiritual exercises of Ignatius of Loyola. Acquaviva’s manual for fathers conducting spiritual exercises, which was completed in 1599, was an indispensable aid in this. The people who took part in the early modern spiritual exercises were also primarily members of the ecclesiastical elite.110\n\nThe creation of apothecaries also merits mention as part of the Jesuits’ social undertakings. Over the course of the seventeenth century, pharmacies were established in the most important Jesuit institutions. Through medicine, the Jesuits sought to cast doubt on superstitions widespread among the faithful and break their attachment to various objects thought to have magical powers (such as cards and amulets). There were substitutes that were acceptable to the church, such as so-called Foy stones111 and Saint Ignatius water, believed to have healing properties.112\n\nThus, through education and pastoral care, the Jesuits found ways to deepen Catholic religious practice and to make the reforms and the mentality of the Council of Trent part of everyday religious rituals and practice.
