        "text": "‘To invite Gen Z to take responsibility over their own lives, is to be able to transcend our own shadow. Providing Gen Z with a meaningful life means living one ourselves. To invest in family and community. To have transcendence in abundance, instead of merely material goods. Where there is hope, instead of simple bashing those who are aimless or confused, Gen Z, like previous generations, can rise like a phoenix from its post-romantic ashes.’\n\nFollowing Hungary’s defeat in the First World War, the victors’ intentions were clear concerning our country: to impose punishments that would result, if not in the short term but in the long term, in the total disappearance of the former Central European superpower…The pain caused by Trianon and the desire to do something about it prompted Nándor Urmánczy, the ‘uncompromising Hungarian’ and a member of parliament of Transylvanian origin, to initiate and announce the National Flag Movement in 1925.\n\nThe M5 channel will be airing such films as the 1996 historical drama about the Magyar tribes settling into the Carpathian Basin titled The Conquest (Honfoglalás), and the 2023 documentary The Rise of the Árpáds (Az Árpádok felemelkedése). Meanwhile, the commercial TV channel TV2 will have the 2023 historical drama Now or Never! (Most vagy soha!) about a different, but equally significant time in Hungarian history, the 1848–1849 Revolution and War of Independence against the Habsburgs.\n\nPaks are facing the Czech Mladá Boleslav, and Puskás Akadémia are facing the famous Italian team Fiorentina in the play-offs of the Conference League. Meanwhile, Ferencváros are the heavy favourites to beat the Bosnian side Borac Banja Luka and thus reach the newly established league phase of the Europa League.\n\nThe country’s premier motorsport venue is now unrecognizable, with the main building and the grandstands at the finish line already dismantled. The entire renovation will cost 105 billion HUF and will be completed by the 2026 Hungarian Grand Prix.\n\nThe iconic McDonald’s at Budapest’s Nyugati Railway Station has reopened after over six months of renovation work that cost 1.8 billion HUF. Widely regarded as one of the most beautiful McDonald’s outlets in the world, the renovation was carefully designed to preserve its unique and historic features.\n\nDrawing on her experience from Paris, Vas closely marked Faulkner, responding perfectly to every move. Among the four riders who persevered to the finish, Vas proved to be the fastest in the uphill sprint.\n\nKing Saint Stephen of Hungary considered this feast so important that he entrusted Hungary to the protection of the Virgin Mary on this day. For this reason, the Virgin Mary is known as the heavenly patroness of Hungary.\n\nThe birth of the Conscious by BCEFW category was preceded by the development of the Conscious Fashion Initiative’s criteria. This initiative focuses on six guiding principles, including diversity and equality, sustainable design supporting the use of recycled materials, a section on safe working conditions, consumer engagement, transparency, and education, all of which underscore the importance of social and environmental responsibility.\n\nThis year’s St Stephen’s Day fireworks will be made spectacular by the use of fireworks mortars, grapeshot, Roman candles, Greek fire, spark fountains, and flame effects. More than 29,000 pyrotechnic products will be launched from approximately 500 launch points—including nine river barges, 65 pontoons, and the Liberty, Elizabeth, and Margaret Bridges.\n\nThe renovation process began with assessing the area’s condition and conducting archaeological excavations. Currently, the reconstruction of the Citadel’s exterior and interior walls is underway in several stages, while the restoration of the inner courtyard is also in progress. As part of the development, green spaces will increase by one and a half times, and a new public park will be created within the fortress walls.\n\nIn the recently published Volume 4, Number 3 of our print magazine, you can read an insightful analysis of the 2024 UK general election results by Lord David Frost; an essay about the different styles of conservatism by Professor Miklós Pogrányi Lovas; and a denunciation of the accusations that the Hungarian government is serving Russian interests by Fidesz founder and current MP Zsolt Németh. Pick up the latest edition of the magazine at your local bookstore or newspaper stand; or you can subscribe to our quarterly magazine on our website to make sure you never miss an issue.\n\nAccording to the organizers, all topics that could help Hungary emerge as a winner in the current global systemic shift will be on the table in Tihany. Discussions will cover challenges to civilization, sovereignty, economic issues, and the state of European cooperation.\n\nThe project, known as the ‘Icebreaker of Knowledge,’ aims to promote science and nuclear energy technologies, identify and support talented young individuals, develop their skills, and provide career guidance. The participants of the expedition, coming from 14 different countries, will engage in a variety of activities, including scientific lectures, experiments, and master classes. They will also learn about the unique flora and fauna of the Arctic and the infrastructural developments along the Northern Sea Route.\n\nPresident John Adams from the Federalist Party was defeated by his own Vice President, the Democratic-Republican Thomas Jefferson in 1800. However, due to the flaws in the original electoral system, this election also became the only one in US history to end in a tie in the Electoral College, and had to be decided by Congress.\n\nThe ninth Kurultaj traditional tribal assembly took place in Bugacpuszta amidst great interest over the weekend. ‘These traditions are not merely entertainment; they form the basis of our identity. They provide an opportunity for both present and future generations to learn about and respect the lifestyle, culture, and values of our ancestors,’ State Secretary for Bilateral Relations Boglárka Illés emphasized in her opening speech at the event.\n\nFollowing a spectacular performance during the last day of the Paris Olympics, 23-year-old Michelle Gulyás won the gold medal in pentathlon. However, many would be surprised if she told them that when she is not competing in the Olympic games, she is chasing criminals.\n\nHungary was represented by 178 athletes across 20 sports, where they won a total of 19 medals—6 gold, 7 silver, and 6 bronze—securing the 14th position in the medal table. This placed Hungary ahead of larger nations such as Brazil, with a population of 205 million, and Spain, with 48.7 million. Hungary’s dominance in the region was also evident, with the other best-performing nation in East-Central Europe, Romania, finished 23rd.\n\nOne of the most decorated male tennis players in the history of the game, 37-year-old Serbian Novak Djokovic has been on a gold-winning spree for the last couple of years. Be it the Australian Open, Wimbledon or any other major tennis tournament, he has performed exceptionally well. Djokovic has always highlighted the fact that the source of his unyielding determination is his Christian faith, which always gives him strength to overcome the hardest challenges on the court.\n\nAt first glance, today’s cinema culture in Budapest seems very bipolar. There seems to be a tension between those who believe that traditional screening venues are long out of date and those who doubt whether a multiplex experience can be called cinema at all. One thing is certain: the story of Budapest’s cinema culture continues to unfold every day, and the main protagonists are us, cinema lovers.\n\nHungary is currently sitting in 13th place on the Olympic medal table with four golds, three silvers, and four bronzes. That is the best in our region, ahead of Romania (15th place), Ukraine (16th), and Croatia (22nd). Also, with the exception of New Zealand, all the countries ahead of us have significantly higher populations."
