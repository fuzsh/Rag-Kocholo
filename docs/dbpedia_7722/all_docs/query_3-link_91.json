        "text": "The main goal of this paper is to briefly sketch the relationship between the transformation of Hungarian printed press after the Revolution and War of Independence of 1848–1849 and the appearance of numerous female writers. The analysis is based not only on the texts which were published by female writers in contemporary press, but also on the research of the manuscript archives of the Hungarian Academy of Sciences, the National Széchényi Library and the Petőfi Literary Museum. The focus of my analysis is the literary career of Júlia Szendrey, who is known as the wife of one of the most famous Hungarian poet, Sándor Petőfi. Only a few people, however, are aware of the fact that she started her own literary career after her husband disappeared in 1849 during the Revolution and War of Independence. The utilization of the methods and outcomes of literary history and social history intertwined in my approach. My argument will focus on the impact of mass media on each literary career with a special emphasis on different approaches to the notion of crisis.\n\nThis paper deals with the inner conflicts of the Hungarian avant-garde movement during the revolutions after WWI (consecutively in 1918 and 1919), and its conflicts with the Communist power in rule in 1919. Eszter Balázs will offer an analysis of their changing terminology regarding art and the artist and the role of the artist and intellectual in society between November 1918 and July 1919, while Gábor Dobó will detail their conflicts with communist institutions during the period March–July 1919. While in a socially and culturally marginal and a politically dissenting position during WWI, the Hungarian avant-garde progressively gained recognition after the end of the conflict. It obtained a mainstream position only during the 1919 Commune. However, this position was not without contradictions. When the Communists took power on March 21 after the “popular democratic” Károlyi government had collapsed, the editors of the avant-garde magazine Ma (Today), the writer and poet Lajos Kassák and the painter Béla Uitz, took part in the cultural programme of the dictatorship of the proletariat as members of the literary and artistic directorates. For Kassák and his associates, it was evident that activists had to create the lyrical and visual idiom of the art of the ‘new world’ that would follow the proletarian revolution. Their journal, Ma did not, however, become the official cultural organ of the proletarian dictatorship. The activists were committed to the communist revolution and its promises of social change, but they did not conceive of their activity as being in the service of party politics. They were therefore unable to implement their ideas for cultural policy in 1919. Kassák and his associates insisted on their sovereignty regarding art, and this led them into confrontation with the leadership of the Hungarian Soviet Republic. Their cause became a point of contention in factional disputes within the government (between the Social Democrats and the Communists). Nonetheless, Ma was able to carry on for a few weeks. Its last issue appeared on the first of July 1919. Officially the magazine ceased to be published on the basis of lack of paper (a typical reasoning of power in times of financial crisis, unwilling to admit to the use censorship). What seems to have caused its demise, like that of many other journals at the time, was the increasingly critical shortage of paper."
