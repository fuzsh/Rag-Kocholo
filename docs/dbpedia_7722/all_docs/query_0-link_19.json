        "text": "Cutting the Way into the Nation: Hungarian Jewish Olympians in the Interwar Era\n\nMihály Kálmán\n\nWAR AND REVOLUTIONS\n\nHungary lost roughly two-thirds of its territory and population, including nearly half of her Jews, with the Trianon Treaty of 1920.1 In the ranks of the vanquished Austro-Hungarian Army, the rate of Jews was lower than their share in the population of the monarchy; 300,000 Jews, including 25,000 officers, served in the course of the war. Since many of the Jews of Galicia and northeastern Hungary became refugees, and because Jews were underrepresented in the infantry corps, the rate of Jewish deaths on the battlefield was lower relative to non-Jewish deaths. At the same time, soldiers of Jewish origin featured prominently among decorated veterans.2\n\nJews also played a prominent role in early postwar Hungary, filling eight of the twenty ministerial positions in Count Mihály Károlyi’s pacifist-democratic government, which was toppled by the Revolutionary Soviet in March 1919. Thirty of the forty-eight People’s Commissars in the short-lived Hungarian Soviet Republic were Jewish, including Béla Kun, the de facto leader, and Tibor Szamuely, the militant ideologue and orchestrator of the Red Terror.3 If not as markedly as among its leaders and perpetrators, with 7.4% Jews were also overrepresented among the victims of class-based persecution at the hand of Szamuely’s “Lenin Boys.” Beginning with August 1919, officers of Rear Admiral Miklós Horthy’s National Army unleashed a wave of “White Terror.” Often assisted by local residents, the death squads murdered hundreds of people identified as Communists, targeting Jews in particular.4\n\nIn addition to Jewish involvement in the democratic and Communist regimes, Jews were also present at the cradle of the interwar Hungarian Kingdom. While representatives of Hungarian aristocracy established the Antibolsevista Comité [Anti-Bolshevik Committee] in Vienna, the main power base of anti-Communist officers was Szeged, a large city near the new Romanian-Yugoslavian border.5 The Szeged Jewish community warmly supported the government-in-the-making from raising substantial funds to filling high-level bureaucratic positions. On May 7, 1919, Jewish officers in a seventy-twostrong unit of the National Army’s officer corps helped disarm the Communist garrison in Szeged, allowing the counterrevolutionary government of Count Gyula Károlyi to relocate from Arad.6\n\nThe exact number of Jewish officers involved in the disarming became the subject of an early attempt at questioning the role of Jews in the nascent foundation myths and hagiographies of war and counterrevolution, the yardsticks of battle-worthiness and patriotism. A monograph on the history of the Szeged government published by a Jewish news reporter in 1919 claimed that twenty-two Jews partook in the operation in a unit led by a Jewish officer.7 In response, a commander who had organized the disarming reprimanded the author for inflating the number of Jews from fifteen, falsely claiming that they had been led by a Jewish officer, and exaggerating the importance of the victory.8 The lower number is confirmed by the Hungarian Jewish Lexicon,9 and according to Kálmán Shvoy, himself a participant of the attack and the foremost organizer of the National Army, no Jewish commander was appointed. As Shvoy pointed out, however, the attack indeed “marked a turning point in the military fortune” of the Szeged government.10\n\nShvoy made no mention of the Jewish officers’ role in the disarming in his diary, but he no doubt recalled it in 1933, when addressing leading rabbis and hundreds of attendees in the Szeged Jewish cemetery, at the inauguration of the first Jewish war heroes’ memorial, the building of which he had initiated years earlier. Accompanied by a lavish military parade and a variety of Christian leaders, Shvoy spared no compliment to the Jewish community of Szeged, reminding his audience “how many Christians and Jews [had] faced hand in hand the greatest suffering, the greatest bitterness in life: the fear of death.”11 The leaders of the Szeged and Budapest Jewish communities assured Shvoy after the event: “‘the future will justify you’… ‘this statement is bound to receive the warmest welcome from Jews abroad … and benefit the cause of Magyarhood abroad.’”12 Two weeks later, Shvoy was reprimanded by a superior officer for meddling in politics and discharged after an undue and humiliating process.13 Not only did Shvoy not relent in championing peaceful coexistence or in his fight for the rights of Jewish war heroes, but a few years later he helped codify into law the recognition of the patriotic services of another category of Jews who had advanced the Hungarian cause with their weapons: Jewish Olympians.\n\nThe violent succession of the war and three regime changes prepared the scene for the interwar debates on Jewish courage, chivalry, and patriotism— discourses that underlay discussions on Jewish Olympians’ achievements. After the exchange on Jewish officers’ role in the Szeged disarming, a momentous press trial emerged around the question of Jewish loyalty as expressed by military service and self-sacrifice. In January 1921, Representative Elek Avarffy claimed in an article that the number of Jewish veterans does not exceed 50,000, of whom only 500 died on the battlefield. Lajos Szabolcsi, editor in chief of the preeminent Jewish newspaper, Egyenlőség [Equality], immediately refuted the claim and announced that he had compiled an archive of 10,000 Jews killed in action. The parties took the case to court, and the trial dragged on until June 1923. While the government initially refused Szabolcsi’s request to publish confessional statistics on war heroes, it did resolve to disclose such data on fraudulent military contractors, commonly believed to have been overwhelmingly Jewish. Finally, war hero statistics were made available and confirmed Szabolcsi’s claim.14 Egyenlőség won a major battle against excising the memory of Jewish heroes from the ranks of Hungarian brothers-in-arms.\n\nDUELS\n\nSzabolcsi’s Egyenlőség became the leading public forum of Hungarian Jewry under his father, Miksa Szabolcsi, who had revived the journal after its single-issue campaign against the Tiszaeszlár blood libel of 1882-1883; he remained editor in chief until his death in 1915. Egyenlőség was committed to molding Jews into Hungarian patriots of Jewish persuasion; achieving legal reception, it became the main organ fighting antisemitism.15 Even in peacetime, this fight in many cases went beyond press insults or legal disputes and took a violent form. The Szabolcsis, both father and son, became staunch supporters of defending Jewish honor in duels—real or reenacted.\n\nIn 1892, Szabolcsi attempted to prevent a duel between 1917 Minister of Justice Vilmos Vázsonyi, a gifted Jewish lawyer, and Ferenc Mezey, leader of the Neolog National Office, which had issued a statement questioning Vázsonyi’s honor. The editor of Egyenlőség published an open letter to the parties, begging the National Office to revoke the communiqué, lest “the Jewish congregation will become a battlefield, the synagogues dueling halls, the rabbinical schools courts of honor, the cantor will fight a pistol duel with the rabbi.”16 Although Szabolcsi despised intra-confessional scandals, he came to be an ardent advocate of dueling. After Theodore Herzl declared in 1893 that “a half dozen duels would very much raise the social position of the Jews,”17 and when Jewish students came under attack at Hungarian universities in 1895, Szabolcsi echoed his words: “The epidemic of Jew-hatred has to be combated by duels[he wrote in Egyenlőség]. Today our Jewish youth will convince the Jew-haters of our right only with the sword…. The extremists among the anti-Semites come from the rural areas. They do not yet know that the Jews have learned well the wielding of the sword.”18 Szabolcsi’s words resonated well with the broad urbanized, assimilated, and relatively wealthy stratum of Budapest Jews. Indeed, their swordsmanship continued to reign supreme even beyond the Holocaust, although its setting and ascribed meanings had changed remarkably.\n\nIf statistics are of any guidance, Jews zealously espoused the practice of dueling. In 1888, Jews represented 13% of those convicted for dueling, and in the interwar period their share was around 50%.19 The duel fashion among Jews was unquestionably aided by the publicity of a number of high-profile duels of the prewar era that had involved one or more Jews. In 1882, Mór Wahrmann, industrialist and community notable, exchanged shots with Győző Istóczy, founder of the National Antisemitic Party (1883); in the same year, the champion of Szabolcs County challenged and lost to a Jewish lawyer who had blamed county bureaucrats for the exacerbation of the Tiszaeszlár blood libel. Jewish lawyer Dr. Gyula Rosenberg challenged and shot to death Count István Batthyány for the daughter of a wealthy convert, Ilona Schossberger, whose secret Jewish marriage to Rosenberg was overruled by a Catholic one to Batthyány, arranged by her father. Rosenberg had to issue a number of open challenges until Batthyány gave in and declared him duel-worthy, a category traditionally reserved for aristocrats, nobles, officers, university graduates, bureaucrats, and wealthy citizens.20\n\nAs George Eisen put it: “Wielding a weapon satisfied a compensatory reflex, part of an attempt by the emerging Jewish community to identify itself with, and be accepted by, the ruling classes by engaging in a pursuit that was associated with virility, masculinity, and honor in many European societies.”21 Following the German-Austrian tradition, dueling became a significant litmus test of Jewish honor in Hungary in the Era of Dualism (1867-1918), an important quasi-legal step on the path toward complete emancipation and assimilation. By engaging in performing the manners and customs of the loosely defined úri “gentlemanly” class, dueling Jewish individuals reaffirmed their equality to it; participating in a duel demonstrated that the duelist was worthy of gentlemanly fight. At times, this classification was subject to written duel codes, as it happened both in the army and on the second most turbulent scene of dueling: duel societies at the universities.22\n\nIn 1897, a Jewish law student invited criticism from Herzl’s Die Welt by rejecting the idea of a Jewish duel society in Egyenlőség, and no such society appears to have existed in the interwar period. 23 Nevertheless, universities became the hotbed of swordfights in Hungary as well. After an election to the body representing university students, the number of student duels soared in 1896-1897 and were followed closely in Egyenlőség. As many of the Jewish law students did not vote, out of fear or disinterest, an antisemitic president was elected, and a number of Jewish students were insulted by their peers. However, the proportion of Jewish students was a reputable 30% among those preparing for legal professions, and thus the Budapest law school became a fertile soil for the duel epidemics that characterized the year following the election.24 Considering the high number of lawyers and law students among Jewish duelists, it is perhaps not surprising that the first Hungarian Olympic champion in fencing was a young Jewish law student from Budapest, Jenő Fuchs (1882-1955).\n\nJEWISH SPORTS\n\nFuchs was not the first in the row of Hungarian Jewish Olympians. Alfréd Hajós (1878-1955), the young architecture student dubbed “the Hungarian dolphin,” defeated waves and cold, and he won two gold medals in 100-meter and 1200-meter freestyle at the Athens Games of 1896.25 There were no Jewish sportsmen on the Hungarian teams of the 1900 and 1904 Olympics, but in London two young Jewish men from Budapest carried the day. Richárd Weisz (1879-1945), the colossal weightlifting and wrestling champion, won the first gold medal—in heavyweight wrestling—out of Hungary’s three. Even greater praise was won by Fuchs, who led the six-member sabre team to victory and came in first at the individual competition.26 The Hungarian sabre team included three additional Jewish sportsmen living in Budapest: another lawyer, Oszkár Gerde (1883-1944), Dezső Földes (1880-1950), and Lajos Werkner (1883-1943), a dentist and an engineer, respectively.27 Four years later, all four Jewish sabre fencers repeated their achievements, again winning two out of three Hungarian gold medals. In 1908, seven, and in 1912, six of the eight sabre finalists were Hungarian, while four out of six and four out of eight of the Hungarian team members were Jewish.28 At the eleven Olympics that featured a Hungarian team between 1908-1964, Hungarian sabre fencers won all of the individual, and nine of the team championships. Only one among the best Jewish fencers hailed from the “Jewish” Magyar Testgyakorlók Köre (MTK) or “Zionist” Vívó és Atlétikai Club (VAC). Instead of Jewish clubs, the most stellar and contentious moments of Hungarian Jewish fencers on the preeminent scene of interwar sports nationalism were the result of universal sports education, Jewish involvement in the Budapest sports scene, and the work of Italian fencing masters.\n\nWhile the Trianon treaty strictly curtailed the strength of the Hungarian Army, the state was invested in improving the physical fitness of its potential draft pool. Most notably, a physical education system was created (leventemozgalom, Levente Movement), in order to prepare boys under twenty-one years of age for military service.29 Schools of all types and levels put emphasis on physical education, and Jewish students soon excelled at national competitions.30 There was usually no lack of help for talented, young Jewish sportsmen. Even a cursory glance at the Hungarian sports scene through the career paths of Jewish Olympians reveals the ways in which their successes were embedded in a densely interconnected microcosm of Jewish sports enthusiasts, athletes, trainers, managers, and benefactors.\n\nThe victories of the three Jewish fencers came at a juncture of the soon-to-be-extinct duel tradition as well as the increasing Jewish interest and involvement in sports. Fuchs was reclusive, trained and competed without being member of a club, and never participated in national championships. He did, however, partake in at least two duels: one against his teammate, Gerde, in 1910, and a second against a Jewish member of Parliament in the 1920s.31 Gerde and Werkner, on the other hand, were members of prestigious sport clubs, and Werkner won national titles in team and individual sabre in 1913 and 1914.32 It is symptomatic of the transition from the pursuit of traditional aristocratic pastimes such as hunting and dueling to sports that nearly the entire first cohort of Hungarian Jewish Olympians became involved in organizing sports life in the country.33 In late Dualist Hungary, the Jewish community welcomed and enriched Hungarian sports in a multitude of ways—and would so with renewed commitment after World War I. Hajós became the head coach of the Hungarian soccer team in 1905-1906, after playing for it twice; Werkner was elected president of his club in 1909; Weisz began training wrestlers in his club in 1908; and even the loner Fuchs agreed to serve as the head fencing trainer of the same club, although he stepped down two years later.34\n\nThe humanist pacifist pedagogue and physical educator Ferenc Kemény was member of the founding group of the modern Olympic Games, a close companion of Baron Coubertin and the harbinger of international sports to Hungary and her Jewish community.35 In Hungary, the club of which Weisz and Fuchs were members was established in 1888 by Jewish merchants, in response to a ban on Jewish membership in two of the largest sports clubs of Budapest. Although the club’s organizers and membership were overwhelmingly Jewish, it never identified as such and aimed to be accepted as a full-fledged Hungarian club. Its name, Magyar Testgyakorlók Köre [MTK, Circle of Hungarian Physical Educationists], prominently featured the word “Magyar” and a novel Magyarization of the German körperliche Erziehung.36 MTK evolved into a major sports club under the industrialist Alfréd Brüll (1876-1944), its president between 1905 and 1940. Beyond important positions in Hungarian sports, Brüll was also the president of the International Wrestling Federation in 1924 and 1928, and a close companion of the wrestling champion Richárd Weisz. After his victory in London, Brüll provided Weisz a substantial loan to purchase a large coffee house in Budapest, and Weisz continued to train wrestlers in MTK until the end of his life.37\n\nThe closest thing Hungary had to a Zionist sports club was the VAC, Established in 1906 with the assistance of the founder of the Hungarian Kadima scout and the Keren Kayemet organzations, Lajos Dömény-Deutsch, the club boasted more than 1,500 members by 1928.38 Unlike most Zionist sports clubs in Eastern Europe, however, the VAC did not allude in its name to the contemporary vocabulary of Jewish power and heroism, and its members did not sport blue-white outfits; rather, the emblem of the club was an inventive representation of the club’s name as a Star of David. Although VAC adopted an assimilationist stance, in particular after the war, its initially slightly Zionist orientation already rendered it more Jewish in the eyes of the public than MTK.39 As a telling, if not trustworthy, account went, fans at an MTK-VAC soccer game encouraged their teams by shouting “Go, Hungarians!” and “Forward, Israel,” respectively40 [Fig. 1].\n\nThe only Hungarian Jewish Olympian of the interwar era to have been a member of a “Jewish” club was Endre Kabos, VAC member between 1926 and 1930.41 In his first year there, VAC won the national championship. The team also included Zoltán Dückstein, who had reorganized VAC in 1920, became its overseer, was the trainer and jury of the Hungarian gymnastics team at the Los Angeles and Berlin Games, and head of physical education at the Budapest Jewish Gymnasium.42 For most of its history, however, VAC only had mediocre fencers relative to the Hungarian swordmasters of the era and even closed down its fencing department for some time after World War I.43\n\nOne of the most popular fencing halls in Budapest, the scene of numerous duels, was opened in 1885 by Károly Fodor (Mózes Freyberger), a Jewish fencing master.44 Attila Petschauer (1904-1943) trained in this hall between the ages of eight and twenty, winning four national youth championships and becoming team sabre Olympic champion in 1928, as member of the Nemzeti Vívó Club [NVC, National Fencing Club].45 NVC was established by Marcell Hajdú, an early Zionist lawyer from Budapest who had studied in Heidelberg and in 1912 trained the victorious sabre team.46 NVC also counted among its members Sándor Gombos (1895-1968); its captain was János Garay (1889-1945), team sabre Olympic champions in 1928. Both Garay and Gombos were for years members of the István Tisza Fencing Club (TIVC),47 established by Gombos in 1925, when Jewish fencers left the oldest, most prestigious, and increasingly hostile Hungarian club, Magyar Athlétikai Club [MAC, Hungarian Athletics Club]. Endre Kabos was also a member of TIVC from 1930 until 1934, became team sabre Olympic champion in 1932, and won individually as well as with the team in Berlin, as a member of the Újpesti Torna Egylet [UTE, Neu-Pest Athletics Association].48\n\nUTE was financed by Lipót Aschner, director of the Tungsram lightbulb factory. After the war, Aschner commissioned the building of the UTE stadium to Hajós, the first Hungarian Olympic champion, who also won a silver medal (no gold was awarded) with his plan of the Budapest swimming stadium in 1924.49 In the mid-1920s, Aschner gave a job at Tungsram to Károly Kárpáti, an emerging wrestler just out of metallurgical school, who went on to win seven national championships, a silver medal in Los Angeles, and a gold in Berlin. In 1934, Aschner stepped down from the leadership of UTE, but in the same year hired for Tungsram the new UTE member, Endre Kabos, who had struggled to make ends meet even after his first Olympic gold.50 Apart from UTE, another locally embedded team with prominent Jewish involvement was III. Ker. TVE [3rd District (Alt-Ofen) Athletics and Fencing Association],51 which had three Jewish Olympic champions—two goalkeepers, a key player.52 It was trained by a former player and war veteran Béla Komjádi (1892-1933), coach of the national water polo team from 1926.53\n\nFinally, one has to acknowledge the role played by Italian fencing masters. Földes was trained by Angelo Toricelli and became Olympic champion with the team in London and Stockholm. He emigrated after 1912, becoming the only Hungarian Jewish Olympic champion to leave the country before World War II.54 Even more significant was the role of Italo Santelli, who trained generations of fencers in Fodor’s fencing hall, from Földes’s teammate, Gerde, to Petschauer, Gombos, Garay, and Kabos.55 With Santelli’s help, the sabre team defeated Italy three times before World War II, avenging the defeats in the Olympic final of 1924 and in the World War I. Incidentally, Santelli was also the trainer of Regent Horthy.56\n\nIt was this multilayered web of motley sports enthusiasts concentrated in Budapest that made possible the tour de force of Hungarian Jewish Olympians between the two world wars. Beginning with the 1920s, dueling became a rare phenomenon,57 and in the relative peace leading up to another catastrophic war, Jewish masculinity, heroism, and patriotism were primarily expressed by keeping the memory of Jewish war heroes alive. However, the victories of Jewish Olympians presented another opportunity for the Jewish community to prove its virtues to the Hungarian public [Fig. 2].\n\nTHE FIRST GENERATION\n\nThe contours of the debate on Hungarian Jewish Olympians began to emerge already before the war, as Egyenlőség eloquently celebrated the triumph of Weisz and Fuchs with an article entitled “The Ethnic/Racial Magyars.”58 According to the author, their victories “benefited the popularization of Hungarian independence abroad; more than seventy-two books and journals were published with state subvention…. This triumph will fill in the hiatus of Hungarian diplomatic representation for a few years.” The author denounced the Hungarian press for its silence about the origins of the gold medalists, while it had praised ethnic Magyars who as much as got into the finals. Quite the contrary, Egyenlőség wrote, the Jewish champions, who just days before their victory were written off as “the sportsmen from [the wealthy Jewish district of] Újlipótváros, Jewish youngsters,” were now celebrated as “representatives of thousand-year-old ethnic Magyar virtues, physical agility and power” by the Hungarian press, although they were “four-thousand-year-old men, even if often dated for yesterday. Yesterday, when they not so much came but intruded to eat up the bread of those who had been residing here for a millennium.”59 Egyenlőség decried that while wild-cat bankers and coat thieves were always explicitly identified as Jews, Jewish Olympians were not and could join the team only thanks to the efforts of the “meddlesome [president of the MTK] Alfréd Brüll, hailing from Úlipótváros.”60\n\nFour years later, Egyenlőség bitterly condemned the absence of state officials from the reception of the victorious Fuchs at the Western Railway Station. Only children and sports-loving youngsters came to greet Fuchs on the station, and the only body represented was a Jewish rowing club, although “when [Fuchs] himself won, and when he assisted the Hungarian sabre team in its victory … the Hungarian flag ran up the pole of the stadium. The flag of Hungarians, not that of the Fuchses, the Pest lawyers, not even that of Jewish settlements in Palestine.”61\n\nIn 1915, Miksa Szabolcsi died and passed on the editorship of Egyenlőség to his son, Lajos. After the war, and under Lajos Szabolcsi, Egyenlőség became the chief medium of restoring Jewish honor by forcing the state to acknowledge the patriotism of Jewish war heroes. From 1928, Egyenlőség had the lion’s share in the consequential controversies on Jewish Olympians, which dwarfed the short exchanges following the London and Stockholm Games. The experience and results of war and revolutions, the waning tradition of dueling, and the rise of Jewish sports combined with the discourses of Great Hungarian, Hungarian Jewish, and ethnic Magyar nationalisms to form the background of the debates. As Hungary headed into a collision course in domestic politics and foreign policy, it became a great power in sports, mobilizing and winning the acclaim of millions of fans, including the officialdom of the Hungarian Kingdom, the Jewish leadership, and at times even racist ideologues.\n\nCONSOLIDATION\n\nThe Trianon Treaty set the stage for the national and international Kulturkampf [culture struggle] waged by the dishonored Hungarian Kingdom against her Jews and the Little Entente, or the Successor States, as Romania, Czechoslovakia, and Yugoslavia were called. Domestically, the “dismembering of Hungary” eradicated the need for Jews as cultural allies and modernizing capitalists by rendering Hungary a virtually homogenous nation-state.62 As Vera Ranki wrote, “The source of all problems, economic and social was simply put down to two causes: the Entente powers were blamed for all the outside ills and the Jews for internal problems.”63\n\nAfter their emancipation in 1867, Hungarian Jewry, particularly in the ethnolinguistic heartlands that were to remain part of Hungary, underwent a process of more rapid and pervasive acculturation toward the ruling Magyars than most, if not all, Eastern European Jewish communities. Jewish acculturation was also significantly more complete than that of other nationalities in Hungary. Magyarizing of names became the norm, intermarriage and conversion rates were high, particularly in times of crises. Nevertheless, the level of integration of Jews into society remained relatively low. Jews were prominent in economic and cultural life and were heavily urbanized relative to the large Magyar peasant-gentry society. In 1868, the religious community split into Orthodox, Status Quo, and moderate reformer, Neolog, denominations. Neolog Judaism, an important channel of assimilation, was strongest in urban areas, particularly in Budapest. The capital also comprised the largest concentration of Jewish industrialists, bankers, businessman, intellectuals, and professionals—this helped Budapest become a Jewish and Hungarian sports scene of national and international significance.64\n\nThe already unrivaled influence of the capital on Hungarian life, and on acculturated urban Jewry, steeply increased following the annexations of Hungarian land by the Little Entente. In demographic terms, Budapest Jews constituted 22.4% of the Jewish population of the country in 1910; this rate grew to 45.5% by 1920, following the annexations. The Jewish share in the city’s population remained about 23.1-23.2%.65 At the same time, the narrow ethnic majority of Magyars in Hungary increased from a mere 54.5% in 1910 to 92.1% in 1920. Although this number included Jews, who were not officially considered a minority, the Jewish share in the population of the so-called Dismembered Hungary remained approximately 4.5%. As this, Jews comprised the second largest ethnic minority; the proportion of Germans (Danube Swabians) was about 5%.66 With the ethnic balance tilted decisively in favor of Magyars, Hungarian Jews became a minority competing with them for resources in a mutilated economy.67 To curb Jewish competition, particularly in light of Magyar immigration from the Successor States, a Numerus Clausus was introduced in 1920. The law limited the proportion of minority students at their share in the population, limiting the rate of Jewish university students to 6%. The law’s use of the term “racial and confessional minorities” signaled a change toward the perception of Jews as a race rather than a confessional group, codified by the Law of Reception in 1895.68 The Numerus Clausus was enforced rather laxly, yet Jewish enrollment in universities gradually decreased from 28.4% before the war to 14.1% and 8.3% in 1931-1932 and 1936-1937, respectively.69\n\nAfter the war, antisemitism exploded with unheard-of pogroms and spread at an alarming rate. Jews were accused of disloyalty, profiteering, and unheroic conduct, while Jewish involvement in Béla Kun’s Communist regime and the Red Terror provided further ground for antisemitism.70 Apart from scattered terror attacks, Jews were also threatened by the emergence of a “Christian course,” in which Christian in most cases meant not only non-Jewish, but anti-Jewish.71 According to Vera Ranki, “The main trends of Hungarian political thought met on the common platform of antisemitism and nationalism,” and the former, apart from being a “default” attitude of the narrow Christian middle class, “had an enormous appeal to students and to clerks, to officers and to workers, to grocers and to gentry.”72 The Swabian minority, which played a substantial role in the army, was an important catalyst of antisemitic tendencies.73 Extremist organizations mushroomed in the 1920s and built strong ties with Hitler’s Nazi Party very early on. Radical racism and antisemitism, espousing a pseudoscientific notion of an organic nation, emphasized the innate, primordial attributes of authentic Magyars. Although its thrust developed in a variety of ways, a common denominator of rightist Hungarian political thought was the idealization of the Magyar race, of Christians versus Jews, and of the peasantry versus urban dwellers.74 As we shall see, these trends in the development of political orientations, and of the perception of Jews, were interwoven into the political rhetoric of the interwar period and increasingly migrated to the legal plane as well.\n\nHowever, Jews enjoyed a period of relative tranquility after the White Terror. In 1921, the wealthy Transylvanian aristocrat István Bethlen was sworn in as prime minister and served in this position under Regent Horthy until 1931. Bethlen was devoted to the consolidation of Hungary and sought the goodwill of the Entente powers; thus, in Wilsonian Europe, the treatment of the country’s Jewish minority acquired particular significance. Concerned about the tarnishing of the country’s image by the White Terror, Bethlen played an important role in putting an end to violence.75 He not only sought to appease the victorious powers by warranting the protection of the Jewish minority, but also counted on Jews to attract and manage domestic and foreign investments, participating in the rebuilding of the country. In 1925, Bethlen announced that the Numerus Clausus had been a temporary measure, and in the next few years he restored Jewish representation in the Upper House and the regional bureaucracies. Nevertheless, Jews were increasingly squeezed out from the bureaucracy, intended to be filled with Magyar gentry, and the officer corps, which contained a strong Swabian contingent.76 The lack of available jobs, combined with antisemitic attacks, might have also contributed to the turn to sports; as Kramer remarked, “For prospective Jewish tertiary students of this period, street muscle had greater deterrent value than government fiat.”77\n\nThe Jewish community was receptive to Hungarian Jewish rapprochement, though this mainly materialized itself in symbolic pronouncements of mutual loyalty. The “old, nondemocratic Jewish leadership, largely drawn from the Neolog community of Budapest” preserved its position as the sole representative of Hungarian Jewry and was wary of implicating Hungarian authorities in the mistreatment of Jews or antisemitism by having recourse to outside help.78 Just after the White Terror, Hungarian Zionists attempted to seek redress by mobilizing world opinion, but they were condemned by the official leadership for “betraying the Magyar fatherland.” The same isolationism characterized the leadership regarding the issue of the Numerus Clausus. In 1921, 1925, and 1930, representatives of American, French, and Anglo-Jewry, notably the Board of Deputies of British Jews and the Alliance Israélite Universelle, offered help with defending Hungarian Jewish interests in the League of Nations, but the offer was refused by Hungarian Jewish leaders.79 Indeed, until 1931, Hungarian Jewry did not have substantial contacts with international Jewish organizations;80 instead, another beacon of its patriotism became its relationship with Hungarian Jews across the new borders.\n\nIn the Dualist Era, Magyarized Hungarian Jews were eager and significant allies of Magyars in the borderlands. During and after the Trianon deliberations, their self-identification as Magyars was a key element of Hungarian foreign policy based on border revisionism or irredentism. Despite Hungarian and Jewish protest, Jews in Romania were registered as a minority differentiated from Magyars from 1920, and in Czechoslovakia from 1933.81 Although Jews in the Successor States were encouraged to become patriots of their new countries, or even Zionists, to a large part they remained dedicated Hungarians. In addition to reiterating stories of Jewish heroism in war and counterrevolutions or of Jewish contributions to economic and cultural development, revisionism as a common denominator and basic tenet of Hungarian and Hungarian Jewish foreign policy became a means of combating mounting attacks against Jews.82 Whether guided by desperation, optimism, or both, in the interwar period the “ostrich politics” of imperial nostalgia continued to characterize Hungarian Jewish politics, as well as Hungarian domestic and foreign policy.83 As Mendelsohn noted, “Jewish well-being continued to be firmly linked to the preservation of conservative (or even reactionary) order…. This was not a happy position for Hungarian Jewry to find itself in but it is difficult to see what other choice it had.”84 Relentless Jewish eagerness to cooperate with and be of service to the state helped safeguard Jews against bloodthirsty antisemites who were gaining increasing influence in the 1930s. Even so, the Jewish leadership, seen as acquiescent and ineffective, was often portrayed on East European Jewish political fora as cowards, or backward shtadlones.85 Indeed, as Mendelsohn wrote, “Of all the lands of East Central Europe, Hungary was the most unfavorable environment for the emergence of modern Jewish politics.”86 There were no Jewish parties, a markedly Jewish cultural orientation and education were substantially less widespread than among other East European Jewries, and there were no large Jewish organizations apart from the communal leadership.87 Communism was not a viable option after 1919, and while Jewish representatives were to be found in a variety of parties, their appeals on behalf of the Jewish citizens and community of the state were most often ignored. At the same time, the quest for a new Jew, and a Jewish state, was no less fruitless in Hungary.\n\nAs Herzl wrote already in 1903, referring to the Hungarian tricolor, “Hungarian Zionism can primarily be red-white-green.”88 Indeed, Zionism was unappealing and hence marginal in Hungary; its relative unsubstantiality remained essentially unchanged until the Holocaust. The membership of Zionist organizations hardly ever rose above 1% of the Jewish population, or a few thousand people.89 Hungarian Jewry desired reinclusion into Hungarian society on an equal footing, rather than seeking to build a society for themselves in Palestine or elsewhere. The number of aliyot remained diminutive in the interwar period, and the Hungarian Zionist Association (HZA) repeatedly declared its Hungarian patriotic sentiments.90 As a poet put it: “I am a Zionist in body, heart, and soul, [but] Jewish and Hungarian pain strikes my heart equally…. I love and adore my father, Palestine, the land of our ancestors, and my mother country is our sweet homeland, Hungary.”91 Despite a multitude of similar expressions of Hungarian patriotism, the religious community and assimilated Jews looked upon Zionism as a potential threat to Hungarian Jewish relations. As in the case of international appeals against persecution, community leaders took a strong stand against Zionists in favor of the Hungarian state. Thus, for instance, the Neolog National Office played a major role in preventing the Ministry of Interior from recognizing the HZA.92 Unsurprisingly, when the HZA set up a Betar organization providing sports and military education for Jewish youth, it became the target of numerous attacks on the part of the Jewish as well as the Hungarian leadership during its short-lived history.93\n\nFROM AMSTERDAM TO LOS ANGELES\n\nThe main vehicle for articulating Hungarian Jewish patriotism in the interwar era remained the press, particularly that of Budapest, where Jewish journalists and periodicals wielded significant influence.94 In addition to the reports on cross-border Hungarian Jewish patriotism, Egyenlőség also ran a series titled “What has Jewry Done for Hungarianhood?,” which listed Jewish scientific and artistic contributions to the Hungarian cause. More importantly, the journal also published regularly on the Jewish heroes of the Revolution of 1848.95 Beginning with 1928, the victories of Jewish Olympians provided ample material for Egyenlőség to reassert its attitude to the “Jewish Question.” Considering the widely varying audiences, Olympic victories catered to at least three major political aims. For Hungarian Jewry, and its leadership in particular, Jewish Olympians proved the continued Jewish loyalty to Hungary and illustrated the validity of this oft-decried relationship to Jews abroad. For the Hungarian state, Olympics provided the foremost international scene to showcase its talents and demonstrate to the world its indigenous vitality and its superiority in comparison with the Little Entente.\n\nAs Jack Kugelmass has noted, male international sports competitions are particularly conducive for catering to nationalism.96 Indeed, the Olympics had the potential to line up the nation behind its sportsmen, unlike the more divisive national sports competitions, and became an important tool of Hungarian interwar soft power diplomacy. In addition to serving as an international and even playing ground of states, on the national level the Olympics became a point of reference of Jewish patriotism, serving as an even field for Jews vis-à-vis Magyars, just as it had served as such for Hungary vis-à-vis other countries. Unlike Jewish achievements in culture, politics, or economic life, sports successes were viewed as a result of a fundamentally objective, fair, and gentlemanly competition. Thus, it acquired paramount value for Jews anxious to prove their patriotism to their compatriots. In addition, the Olympics were one of the few international scenes where Hungarian Jewry as a group was represented. Indeed, sports, and fencing in particular, became the foremost means of demonstrating “an ability of Jews … to hijack the ultimate symbols of a dominating culture, and, in so doing, reassur[e] themselves collectively in their physical potential.”97\n\nWith two gold, three silver, and four bronze medals, Hungary ranked thirteenth at the 1924 Olympics—its all-time worst until 2008. Among the Jewish athletes, Hajós and Dezső Lauber (1879-1966), two renaissance men of sports, won a silver medal for architectural design (no gold medal was awarded), while János Garay finished third in individual and second in team sabre. After the relative failure of the Paris team, Hungary held its breath for two weeks, waiting for the coveted gold medal, in 1928. Finally, the Hungarian anthem was played in honor of Dr. Ferenc Mező, a Jewish teacher, winner of the art competition with his work on the history of the Olympic Games.98\n\nThe liberal Zionist Országos Egyetértés [National Concord], a longtime rival of Szabolcsi’s Egyenlőség, was the first Jewish periodical to greet Mező’s achievement, noting “with great joy that with his spiritual victory the high school teacher of Jewish origin from Budapest rushed to the help of the Hungarian team of athletes, who had been competing not in their best shape.”99 Two days later, Egyenlőség published a series of articles, opening a long succession of press debates, in which the overjoyous tone of Jewish pride interfused with that of Hungarian patriotism and clashed with a disoriented Magyar nationalism and racism.100 Under the headline “Hungarian Jewry and the Olympics,” which was to reappear often on the columns of Egyenlőség, the subtitle declaimed the success of the unemployed teacher, Mező, “a scion of the Grünfeld family from Zalamegye.”101 The heading went:\n\nThe gleaming ray of Hungarian glory, Hungarian power and talent illuminates some of our excellent young Jewish coreligionists, who with all their might contributed to the lustrous triumph of their homeland and nation. Far be it from us to distinguish between Hungarian sportsmen of equal merits but … let us recount the names of the Hungarian champions of Jewish faith who fought so proudly and triumphantly abroad for the greatness and triumph of Hungary.102\n\nThe article went on to elevate Mező to the pedestal of assimilation, loyalty, and service to his fatherland in war and peacetime. Mező’s grandfather was a bibliophile merchant, as was his father, one of eleven brothers, “all faithful Jews and genuine Hungarians.”103 Mező served as a lieutenant in the World War, spending fourteen months on the Russian and eighteen on the Italian front; he was wounded twice, got typhus, malaria, and tuberculosis—and was decorated five times. As the author proudly noted, Egyenlőség had already recorded in the Jewish War Heroes’ Archive that sixteen members of the Grünfeld family fought in the war, and five of them perished on the battlefield. According to the article, Mező refused to accept employment under Communist rule, sympathized with the counterrevolution, and eventually secured a position as a teacher of Latin and Greek in a Budapest school following the recommendation of the National Association of Veteran Teachers. Mező, the report concluded, was “a professing and self-respecting Hungarian Jew” and had now become “the pride of the whole Hungarian Jewry at the same time bringing glory to his Hungarian nation.”104\n\nMező humbly thanked the praise in his letter in the same issue, adding, “I did not fulfill my duty at Nida, Isonzo and Piavena in the hope of receiving decorations. It fills me with great pleasure that I brought glory upon my homeland, faith, and my silver-headed father.” He recalled his years in the Piarist Gymnasium in Nagykanizsa, a city he considered home, even after moving to Budapest, and his work as a sports and literature educator.105 As Imre Blankenberg, the Jewish director of the local branch of the National Commerce Association later remarked, here was “proof that the small shop and the counter may also be the milieu from which world-famous successes burst out.”106 Mező’s life story contested a number of ingrained stereotypes about Hungarian Jews. The son of a religious merchant, coming from a mid-sized urban center now near the Yugoslav border, Mező had already had an impressive oeuvre as a soldier and pedagogue. He was a highly decorated war hero; his honors included the prestigious Signum Laudis and the Iron Cross Third Class.107 Not less importantly, Mező had been successful as a sportsman and had already written three books on Hungarian literature and politics.108 In sum, he had every right to be portrayed as an impeccable patriot in war and an exemplary citizen of the state in peace.\n\nEgyenlőség also interviewed Mrs. Berger, the mother of the silver medalist water polo goalie, István Barta. She duly told the reporter that her son had been an excellent student at the Technical University, served as a volunteer in the war, and was a POW in Italy, while his two brothers were POWs in Russia. Upon his return, he quit the university and began working in the textile business. Mrs. Berger also noted that there had been no hostilities between her son and non-Jewish team members.109 Finally, Egyenlőség provided an overview of former Jewish Olympians and praised the achievements of the substitute water polo goalie György Bródy, and of the epée fencer István Hajdú, son of the National Fencing Club’s founder.110 By rehearsing the family histories of the Grünfelds and Bergers, Jewish journals showcased the internationally acclaimed heroes’ rise from typical, modest, Magyarized, and productivized Jewish backgrounds to their victories, which enabled Hungary to assert its vigorousness to the world and become a great power in sports, if not in geopolitics.\n\nThe majestic victories in other sports notwithstanding, the importance ascribed to sabre fencing overshadowed other Olympic achievements, and it was this sport that fully mobilized the Jewish and non-Jewish public. As the first series of articles appeared in Egyenlőség, the Hungarian sabre team, including three Jews, a Greek Hungarian bank clerk, and two high-ranking Hungarian army officers, narrowly won against Italy in the final.111 National Concord immediately praised Attila Petschauer, who had had a major role in the victory. The article squarely established Petschauer’s achievement within the context of masculinity, patriotism, and imperial nostalgia. The title page read:\n\nThe sword is a particular Hungarian sport, the esthetically pleasing tradition of the knightly middle ages, in the nurturing of which the Hungarian noble derring-do has a lion’s share…. our joy and pride is twofold that Jewish boys also stand their ground in this most Hungarian sport and forcefully demonstrate that the Hungarian Jewish youth can stand its ground not only with respect to spiritual but also physical power on the Olympiad of physical ability…. In the World War … we sacrificed tens of thousands of crippled and tens of thousands of dead to the homeland … , persecution and hatred did not break our steadfast patriotism and our devotion to our faith…. And the result? Even the world fame and world position of the most characteristic Hungarian national sport was fought out with the help of Jews.\n\nWith the spiritual victory of Mező fresh on his mind, the author went on to praise Hungarian Jewish intellect, along with body: “Film and arts, which captivate the masses, herald not only the unbeatable superiority of Jews in general, but the victory of the spirit of Hungarian Jews in particular.” The article mocked the lack of attention devoted to Jewish talent and achievements by the Hungarian public, while “The sword of Hungarian fencers, the gleaming blade of Ferenc Molnár’s spirit radiates all around, forcing by its spark and forces the numerous enemies of Hungarians abroad to respect [them].”112 Having conflated Hungarian Jewish accomplishments on the front, the Olympiad, and in the cultural sphere, the article related the victory to the topical, and recurring, problem of bath resort antisemitism, expressing hope that the “overwhelming majority of the Christian society does not sympathize with such lowly insults.”113\n\nAs in the case of Fuchs in 1908 and 1912, Egyenlőség again picked up on the reception of the champion in Budapest and on a report published in a Christian nationalist newspaper. After Petschauer won the gold medal with the sabre team, and lost to a Hungarian officer in the individual final, Egyenlőség published an article titled simply “Attila,” in clear reference to the Hun ruler and purported ancestor of Hungarians. It described the cheering crowds at the train station and quoted the Catholic conservative Nemzeti Újság [National Newspaper], which had reported on the victory thus: “The Hungarian sabre did not jag, did not shake in the hands of the Hungarian youth. The rays of sunshine were dancing on the blade of this sabre, when the troops of Árpád swept to the Hungarian Plain under gleaming lances, with swords in their hands”114 The author also added “this Hungarian sabre gleamed triumphantly in the hands of Attila Petschauer, a 23-year-old Hungarian Jewish kid, and this sabre gleamed equally in the hands of Vitéz Ödön Terstyánszky, Lt.-Col. of the Hungarian Royal Army when … they beat in sabre every other nation.” The author appealed to the officials of the Ministry of Culture, under whose auspices education and sports belonged, to reconsider the Numerus Clausus, seeing as they did how eminently Jewish youth had fulfilled “their duty in the sacred service of the Hungarian national idea.”115 Finally, the weekly published Petschauer’s letter, in which he reassured Hungarian Jews that there is no real antisemitism in the country and expressed his joy over winning the “fight which is essentially the war of nations in peacetime; the good God to whom I have always prayed helped me and allowed me to win the first Olympic championship to Hungary.”116\n\nIn the same issue, an author voiced doubts about the value of sports in countering antisemitism, noting, however, that Jewish Olympic victories, combined with the fact that many of the winners were also well-educated, is a powerful argument against the delusion of eugenics.117 To drive this point home with regard to Hungary, he wrote, “where Dr. Ferenc Mező, Barta, Petschauer, Hajdu and others were cheered and applauded, there Hungarian heroism, masculinity, physical and spiritual culture was celebrated.” To reinforce the article’s claims, Egyenlőség again published the ever-growing list of Hungarian Jewish Olympians.118\n\nÚj Nemzedék [New Generation], one of the largest Christian-conservative dailies of the interwar era along with Nemzeti Élet [National Life], was the first to attack the Jewish press for their celebration of Olympians. In a letter to the editor, one Dr. J. M. protested against Egyenlőség’s article on Petschauer, claiming that the journal “had made a confessional question from a Hungarian victory” to keep the Jewish Question on the agenda.119 A few days later, New Generation followed up with an article that decried in a similar vein: “Who are those who raise the Jewish question time and again, if not those who grab every opportunity to parade their perception that the Petschauers will always remain Jewish and that they are celebrated by the Jews of Hungary not on account of the glory of the Hungarian but that of the Jewish crest?”120 While Egyenlőség did not relent, National Concord soon distanced itself from its congratulatory article, arguing that Jewish successes will not help fight antisemitism and announcing that they did not “consider the triumph of Jewish champions in Amsterdam to be a particular Jewish victory … despite all our respect we do not consider these results to be of such importance as to merit shofar-blowing them all over the world.”121\n\nEven more remarkable was the tragicomic volte-face of Nemzeti Élet, the national socialist-Hungarist weekly edited by László Budavári, a militant Hungarist and former representative. At first, it cheered the sabre team in good irredentist spirit thus: “The triumphantly sparkling Hungarian sabre shows us the way of duty to the four trampled country-parts [lost after Trianon]! … This victory means the ancient force of our Hungarianhood over all: not the superiority of nothings, swaggerers and the cultured, not the consolidation of cowards, but the superiority of force and courage!”122 After the articles in Egyenlőség and Egyetértés, however, László Levatich, the most active contributor of fiercely antisemitic articles in Nemzeti Élet, made clear that what was at stake for the extreme right here was not a confessional question, as Egyenlőség and even Új Nemzedék had written. Levatich wrote: “If we treat the Jewish question in the only correct context, the racial one … we should not have allowed Jewish sportsmen to represent Hungary abroad, since foreigners might deduce the consequence that Magyars cannot even put together a decent water polo or sabre team without Jews.” Further, the author condemned Egyenlőség for its articles on Jewish sportsmen and champions, noting, however, that “Egyenlőség is right this time, regarding this question. We Magyars cannot strut in borrowed plumes and cannot misappropriate the success of the representatives of the Jewish race for Hungarianhood.” Finally, Levatich proposed that Jews be excluded from the Hungarian team, admitting that this might mean worse results, and suggested that Jews form a separate team at the Olympics, in the hope that Egyenlőség will agree.123 Interestingly enough, at this point Egyenlőség chose to ignore the attacks. It merely published an overview of international Jewish Olympians, noting that Petschauer was praised as the best sabre fencer of the world by a German sports newspaper and providing another sketch of the history of Jewish sports.124\n\nThe state’s attitude, or rather the lack thereof, to the question was evident from the articles of the national military-sports youth education system’s journal, Levente, where any reference to the Jewishness of the Olympians was conspicuously lacking. Throughout several issues in September, Levente stressed the importance of the international spotlight on exemplary Hungarians, the quintessential forces of building the organic nation. And an article went: “Since the war, every Hungarian instinctively senses that our sons must fight at the Olympics not only for victory, but for Hungarian honor, and the peace of every Hungarian. Each and every Olympic point obtained is a particle of Hungarian vitality. These, aligned with force-particles cultivated and obtained on other spaces of Hungarian life, multiplied, and grown in power, content, and value assure the fulfillment of our desires and hopes.”125\n\nThe journal of Catholic youth, Az Erő [Force], applauded all categories of winners, praising Mező’s victory and also establishing the status of the sabre as a national sport: “It is not a coincidence that Hungarian power has shined in the masculine sports of self-defense and assault, in the competitions of sabre fencing, wrestling, and boxing.”126 The reaction of the journal of the National Physical Education Department of the Ministry of Culture was not less laudatory regarding Ferenc Mező’s success, described as a Davidic victory, in which “the work, written in the Hungarian language of limited spread, defeated those edited in large world languages.”127 In Mező’s life, however, the Hungarian language had defeated German nearly a generation ago, as the champion changed his name from Grünfeld.\n\nPerhaps in order to avoid arousing sentiments again, following the Los Angeles Games in 1932, Egyenlőség published only a reserved article after the victory of the water polo team, in which the two goalkeepers and one player were Jewish. The team was trained by Béla Komjádi (1892-1933), a Jewish veteran, former member of the MTK and later the TVE—the club where all three Jewish players trained.128 The article merely enumerated other Hungarian Jewish Olympians, but even this was sufficient to cause a minor uproar. Moreover, this time Egyenlőség remained alone on the piste. Two weeks later, National Concord published a rebuttal of the Egyenlőség article, pointing out that Attila Petschauer did not win the team sabre alone in 1928 and that András Székely is not the best swimmer in Europe. As the author wrote, perhaps with excessive optimism, “the article of Egyenlőség [’equality’] lacks equality. It was not Christians and Jews who went to the Olympics but Hungarian amateur sportsmen … the swimsuit, the athlete shirt makes everyone equal.”129 He also praised the policy of sports newspapers, who anxiously eschewed referring to the Jewish origins of the Olympians. Indeed, sports newspapers, most importantly Nemzeti Sport [National Sports], established by the fencing hall owner Károly Fodor, continued to follow this practice throughout the interwar era.130\n\nOnce again, however, the most grandiloquent, if unintentional, praise of Jewish Olympians’ physical abilities and of their role at the helm of Hungary’s symbolic war came from somewhat unlikely sources. Ferenc Herczeg, head of the Revisionist League and prominent conservative writer, dramatist, and journalist, provided a lucid interpretation of the success in a conservative daily:\n\nIn the world of gas bombs and tanks the sword is not a military weapon any more but something else: a great sports tool that allows its master to validate his individual excellence, which manifests itself in real life as masculinity and chivalry. If a nation, like ours, produces a crowd of phenomenally skillful fencers, one can infer the physical and intellectual excellence of the race … Our boys, along with the Olympic laurel bring home a truth: that a nation, the youth of which are the best fencers in the world, cannot be the servant and slave of nations that cannot match it in the artworks of war or peace.131\n\nThe journal of Regent Horthy’s order of chivalry [Vitézi Rend] praised Olympians for helping Hungary finish sixth in the “great competition of nations” and confidently declared that “they had proven that they are not of a moribund nation condemned to death, but are the battle-trained sons of a nation charging ahead, and possessing a bright future.”132 The Levente Movement’s monthly applauded the Magyar race, as one of the Turanian nations, the largely imaginary race of the Japanese, Turks, Magyars, and even Finns.133 Yet again, it also emphasized the significance of the sabre as the “weapon which to us, Magyars, had brought the most success on the battlefield and in sports, which is the symbol of Magyar courage, chivalry, and masculinity.”134 With an overstretch of the Turanian category, Levente applauded in particular the wrestling match between two “Turanians,” the Japanese Suzuki and Károly Kárpáti, the young Jewish lightweight wrestler, an employee at Ascnher’s lightbulb factory.135\n\nKárpáti finished second in lightweight freestyle wrestling, and three Jewish water polo players won gold medals with the Hungarian team. Although these achievements were also cheered on the pages of the press, the most attention was devoted to the sabre team, and in particular to the young and dashing Endre Kabos (1906-1944). Described as “modest and simple, even austere in his appearance and manners,” Kabos regularly reported to an evening paper from Los Angeles and had a major role in the victory of the team.136 After the Olympics, he announced his retirement due to the lack of sponsors and opened a fruit business. However, he returned to fencing a year later and actively partook in developing a new fencing hall for the UTE team and in convincing the master Santelli to train them.137 Much to his chagrin, Kabos became the focal point of the rapidly exacerbating press debates after 1935.\n\nTO BERLIN\n\nIn October 1932, the former paramilitary warlord and Defense Minister Gyula Gömbös was appointed prime minister. Formerly a militant antisemite, Gömbös publicly revoked his antisemitic views when he came to power, mentioning prominently the patriotic services of Jewish soldiers in the World War I.138 However, Gömbös reinforced Hungarian ties with Italy and the Reich; Gömbös was the first official visitor to Hitler after the latter came to power in 1933. Moreover, Gömbös’s slight turn toward the center further catalyzed the strengthening of extreme right.139 However, Gömbös also feared opinions more extreme than his and thus provided a measure of protection to Jewish interests. As Mendelsohn put it, “So far as the Jewish leadership was con-concerned, the devil they knew was far better than the devil they did not know, all the more so since Gömbös turned out to be not nearly so bad as they had feared.”140 Although in the Gömbös era, Hungarian Jewry was weakened by economic crisis, concerns about the disintegration of the community, and a pervasive sense of fear, it nevertheless remained committed to the government, this increasingly reluctant defender of their rights.141\n\nKabos won European championships both individually and with the sabre team in 1933 and 1934, yet in March 1935, he was not selected to represent Hungary in Naples at a friendly match against Italy. Responding to rumors of discrimination, Lieutenant Colonel Ferenc Filótás, president of the Hungarian Fencing Association, explained that Olympic champions were not welcome by the organizers of the competition. As he assured the public, “no Hungarian fencer may suffer injury.”142 In the same month, just before the Second Maccabiah, the weekly of the Hungarian Zionist Organization reported that VAC requested permission for their fencing team, as well as Kabos and János Hajdú, to participate. Although Filótás gave permission, he condemned the “race- and not confession-based” event, adding that the participants “would cause immeasurable harm not only to themselves but to the entirety of patriotically-minded Hungarians of Jewish faith.”143 According to an account, Kabos visited Filótás personally to announce that he had changed his mind, “considers himself, above all, Hungarian … and only the spirit of competition urged him to go to Tel Aviv.”144 As another source reported, Kabos had been asked to participate at a fencing academy to which “hundred percent Aryan” fencers were also invited, but instead chose to travel to a competition in Italy.145 With the Maccabiah already in full swing, the Zionists’ weekly finally reported that VAC withdrew due to financial reasons. In his report from Tel Aviv, the correspondent gloomily noted that although the Hungarian flag was there, the team was lacking.146 Another Zionist weekly, edited by the former editor of National Concord, claimed that the Neolog leadership had prevented VAC from competing, in order to defend them “from the fatal danger of being regarded as Jews.”147 Although we may never know whether VAC withdrew due to pressure from the government, the Fencing Association, or the Neolog leadership, the fact that all these were perceived by the contemporary Jewish public as possible explanations speaks volumes of the isolation of the Zionist enterprise on the Hungarian scene.\n\nAfter the Maccabiah case, Kabos joined the sabre team to the first World Fencing Championship two months later, in June 1935, and won a gold medal. Later that summer, he wrote a piece on “The Mentality of the Contestant” to the journal of the Sports Department.148 He began with the words, “many of us are made lovers of the saber by the obligatory power of tradition, that is, a historical cause, and even more by the thousand-year-old decrease of the Hungarian race invoked in curses, the tendency to separate.”149 After this description of the “Turanian Curse,” he gave a detailed discussion of the art of sabre and its effect in shaping human character. As Kabos summarized, “the Hungarian is a defiant fighter, this shows the fate of his race: a thousand against one.”150 The expression of fear from the dispersal and atomization of the nation and the determination to revive it by restoring the ancient homeland against all odds no doubt struck a chord with Hungarian nationalists and most Hungarian Jews, including Zionists.\n\nWhile Kabos and his fellow Jewish sportsmen prepared for the Führer’s Olympics in the summer of 1936, Egyenlőség at first remained carefully neutral on the Olympic boycott movement, publishing an article on “Sports and Honor,” perhaps to probe public opinion. Amongst short notes on the disqualification of the Austrian Judith Deutsch and the punishments meted out to pro-boycott Zionist clubs in Czechoslovakia, the article included a short survey of the boycott movement in the international press. It also published, without comments, a letter to the editor, which scorned Hungarian Jewish Olympians, who “having secured their mandate, forgot everything they are obliged to do for Jewry.”151 Despite, or rather because of, the gravity of the situation, however, soon the whole range of the Jewish public lined up behind the mighty column of Hungarian Jewish Olympians, if not behind Egyenlőség.\n\nDays before the Olympics, Egyenlőség resolutely declared that, despite allegations on the part of “swastika-bearers” to the contrary, there was no boycott movement in Hungary. The author cited in length from the newspaper of the Arrow Cross Party, Nemzet Szava [Word of the Nation], established in 1932 by the staunch Hitlerist and Hungarist Zoltán Meskó, founder of the first Arrow Cross Party in 1932. Nemzet Szava demanded that Jewish sportsmen be denied the right to represent Hungary, “in the interests of judging rightly the value of the Hungarian race by foreigners.” While in 1928 National Life was somewhat realistic about the chances of the Hungarian team without Jewish athletes, Nemzet Szava’s wishful racial thinking was blind to any and all Jewish merits. As the author declared, “there are hardly any excellent Jewish athletes. For the sake of those one or two … we should not make this fight of racial importance worthless and meaningless.” In its response Egyenlőség praised the Jews of the Berlin Team, predicting victory for Kárpáti and Kabos, “the pride of Hungarians and in particular Jewish Hungarians.”152 Even this safe prediction did not prevent Nemzet Szava from misfiring a few weeks later [Fig. 3].\n\nKabos, the standard-bearer of the Hungarian team, was fully conscious of the symbolism of competing in the capital of the Third Reich. As he made clear to Egyenlőség, “Jewish athletes, including myself, have a psychological handicap … we will go to a place to demonstrate our strength and ability where our Jewish brothers are considered another race, not humans created by God, even harmful, and they get a treatment according to this painful perception.” However, Kabos criticized the boycotters; in his view, the appropriate defiance of racism was not to be absent from Berlin, but rather to win. This time, he explained, “we will fight not only for universal Hungarian nationhood, Hungarian pride in Berlin but we, Jewish sportsmen, must and want to show the image of Jewish power and virtue.” These thoughts were likely on the mind of most of Kabos’s Jewish teammates and the Hungarian Jewish sports world in general. To demonstrate the attitude of the “Zionist” team, Zoltán Dückstein, sports director of the VAC, expressed hope in Egyenlőség that the gymnast István Sárkány (1913-2009), trained by him in the Budapest Jewish Gymnasium and VAC, would do well. As Egyenlőség concluded, these facts should have been sufficient to quiet those who had not known excellent Jewish sportsmen.153\n\nInstead of denial, the extreme right resolved a new strategy. In response to the Egyenlőség articles on Jewish Olympians and the lack of boycotts, Nemzet Szava complained that the team is “swarming with Jews. Even the majority of the leaders are Jewish…. The Jewish press lies about hoped-for successes, but the whole ado is about having more Jews sent to Berlin on state funds.” Egyenlőség responded with a list of Jewish champions and the words of the weightlifter Pál Garai, who denied that any of his teammates would capitalize on their Jewishness. He reasserted that a boycott would dishonor the nation and explained that a Jewish sportsman “thinks not about how proud his coreligionist will be if he wins, but in front of his eyes darkening from the fever of the fight appear the uplifting three colors of the Hungarian tricolor … As long ago on the battlefields, so in peacetime at the international competitions only the tearful love of the Hungarian homeland did and will provide inspiration.”154\n\nIn a refined act of disagreement, Zsidó Szemle [Jewish Review], the Zionist Association’s weekly, published an article on low-cost mass sports, disparaging the Budapest Community’s youth organization members who “play unionism and bring with themselves the smoky air of the cafes to gatherings of the youth.” Advocating a return to the nation, the author concluded that “it is not books but sports that is destined to move today’s Jewish youth. Jewish sports, in which it ceases to be a paper-Jew and … the ghetto Jew disappears.”155 Uj Magyarság [New Hungarianhood], formerly the mouthpiece of Gömbös and the daily of the Christian “gentlemanly” [úri] middle class, prepared the ground for discussions of racial theories by warning that the “Black danger” posed by African Americans in the “battle of races and nations” is relevant in Hungary more than ever, as “a culture that does not strive to rejuvenate will soften, its gentlemanly virtues will decay.”156 Finally, Zsidó Élet [Jewish Life], established by a former Egyenlőség editor,157 warned that the journal should not engage in racist debates or celebrate champions as Jews, since they were “firstly Hungarians, secondly Hungarians and even thirdly Hungarians.”158 Kabos’s straightforward stance in support of German and, implicitly, Hungarian Jews seemed to have remained ignored.\n\nJust three days into the Games, Károly Kárpáti won the freestyle wrestling in lightweight, defeating the German Wolfgang Ehrl in the Deutschlandhalle, with Hitler present.159 Egyenlőség enthusiastically celebrated Kárpáti for achieving “glory for all his coreligionists of our ancient faith” and was anxious to emphasize the religious affiliation of his family, the Kellners. Describing his background, the article noted that Mr. and Mrs. Kellner “celebrate Jewish holidays with devotion and have a Torah at home” and that they had “raised their son, Károly, to become a real Hungarian and a real Jew.”160 The first secretary of VAC, where Kárpáti was a wrestling coach, extolled him as a sportsmen with “a Jewish heart and a Hungarian will”; a fencing coach praised his religious father, “a gentleman of the most Hungarian flavor” and Kárpáti himself as “the most modest, taciturn sportsman.”161 The articles did not fail to mention his outstanding academic achievements. When a reporter of Egyenlőség visited the Kellners, “sweating toilers of the Hungarian land,” the parents boasted with the high school report of Kárpáti, which described him as “modest, serviceable, well-mannered, and conscious.”162 Emphasizing the generational divide, the reporter pointed out that the parents had been “in their heart people devoted to the tradition,” while their champion son was fully Hungarian and his brother “did not at all resemble a Jew,” riding on horseback on the road to his parents.163\n\nAlthough supportive of Jewish sportsmen’s participation, the tone of the Zionist Jewish Review was sobering and chilling. Remarking upon the excellence of African American and Japanese athletes, “peoples closer to nature,” the author called into doubt the impact of the Olympics on antisemitism. As evidence for the ungratefulness of the state, the author pointed out that although Jewish Olympians often were in need of financial assistance, state institutions and companies were not eager to employ them—Kárpáti, for instance, had taken up a job at the Debrecen Jewish Gymnasium. From a legal standpoint, the author argued, the state was to blame for the unequal affection and allegiance between it and her Jews. While talented Jews were obligated to serve their country, the state had undone emancipation by the Numerus Clausus. Thus, the Jewish Review concluded, Hungarian Jews “need not only Jewish world champions but also champions of the Jewish world.”164 The magazine also compared Jesse Owens’ victory to that of the new Hungarian foil champion Ilona Elek (1907-1988), whose father was Jewish. In the final, Elek defeated the champions of Amsterdam and Los Angeles, the German Helene Mayer, and the Austrian Ellen Preis, both of whom were Jewish. “Can fencing be called an Aryan sport?” Jewish Review asked. With a measure of satisfaction, it noted how fencing took over the role of dueling, “the only struggle in life where the Jews faces only one enemy and also the sole struggle where there is no string-pulling.”165 Finally, in response to the Zionist Telegraphic Agency’s disparaging comments on the lack of boycotts and “Jewish solidarity with the Hungarian government,” an article remarked that there were three paths of Jewish Olympic participation: some were forced to go, others boycotted the Games, and yet another category participated and won “since Jews can also have the same muscles as those of Aryans.”166\n\nAs with earlier Olympics, the men’s sabre events were awaited with the greatest excitement and evoked the fiercest debates. After the victory of the team, New Hungarianhood continued to trumpet its racial tirades and exuberantly venerated the team fighting with “the ancient weapon, the Hungarian sabre,” which “demonstrated to the world even more emphatically how much elemental power, how much vitality there is in this long-suffering Hungarian race, squeezed into the narrow borders of its mutilated country!”167 Having provided an overview of his conception of Hungarian history, the editor-inchief, István Milotay, explained the Olympic fever in Hungary by declaring that the Games are a unique moment that unite and give much-needed hope to the nation. As he argued, the victories were all the more important since “our great national ills in the past twenty years had attacked the basic conditions of power, manly resistance, and competitiveness vis-à-vis other nations.” Now, Milotay wrote, the Olympians had “provided proof of vitality and competitiveness, which demonstrates the nearly limitless racial tenacity of the Hungarian nation.”168\n\nRejoicing over the uplifting victories, New Hungarianhood cited the words of Minister of Interior Kozma: “our achievements in Berlin are the best Hungarian propaganda … the result of our national and racial talents.”169 Finally, Ferenc Rajniss, Gömbös’s former comrade and Minister of Religion and Education of the Szálasi regime, lauded the champions as\n\nour dear sons who had covered the Hungarian flag and crest torn by the storm of history with Olympic wreaths…. There is no Trianon today! The gaps and the dashed lines on the mournful map are covered by the mellow layer of wreaths achieved by iron muscles…. In the Danube valley indestructible biological facilities and capabilities demand right, justice and sunshine for Hungarians Nothing has changed in the last 1000 years in Hungarian biological facilities.170\n\nA few days later, in another “race defender” journal, Lieutenant Colonel Gyula Máté-Törek celebrated the overall third place behind Germany and the United States that Hungary achieved, acclaiming it as “the Westernmost tip of the Turanian sword.” The officer likely spoke for many of his comrades as he honored the sabre fencers, asserting that:\n\nthe ancient Hungarian sword is the main and eternal sacrament of our nation, in the midst of our fetteredness it sparkles into the eyes of the world unchipped, and is frightfully sharp. The 1936 Olympics is the mirror of our physical and intellectual vivaciousness, and at the same time a military victory preaching the belief of our national resurrection, and the sacred token of our eternal life.171\n\nAlthough Egyenlőség came under fire from all sides for giving voice to the Jewish community’s pride in its Olympians, individual sportsmen were at first not insulted. However, while most rightist periodicals satisfied their readers with racist rhetoric, glossing over the origins of the Olympians, Nemzet Szava ferociously confronted Egyenlőség and did not refrain from ad hominem attacks. Responding to the articles in Egyenlőség that had extolled Kárpáti, his victory, and his family, Nemzet Szava claimed that it had thought Kárpáti to be a “brother,” since “he bears such a fine Hungarian name.”172 The article decried that Egyenlőség “had made a racial question out of this,” appropriating the victory as the “racial joy” of Hungarian Jews and thereby—unbeknownst to Kárpáti—“the Budapest ghetto impropriated him to itself.”173 The main target of attacks in Nemzet Szava, however, became Kabos, who lead the team to victory and won the individual championship defeating the Italian Marzi.174\n\nFollowing Kabos’s victory, a former Jewish representative published the programmatic article of Egyenlőség’s attitude toward Hungarian Jewish distinctions, and the journal again came under a salvo from multiple sides. The essay, titled “Our Sons,” described the feelings of Géza Dési while listening to the broadcast of the sabre final. Dési recalled his “prayer sanctified in blood, sweat and indescribable suffering … —Avinu Malkenu—to guide the sword of David while he fights against the Goliath of the entire world.”175 At this elevated moment, Dési wrote, he was convinced that “our protector, the protector of our son, the heavenly patron of the Hungarian-Jewish Endre Kabos ‘shall neither slumber, nor sleep.’” 176 He also explained Kabos’s victory in the context of the sword’s militaristic symbol system, so central to Hungarian nationalism:\n\nYou poor little Trianon Hungary—he exclaimed—, you disdained, plundered, dismembered, dear Hungarian nation of ours. Your glory, your honor, your retaliation, the faith and consolation of Your resurrection symbolically sticks to the sword with which our Hungarian-Jewish brother fights. Our Merciful God, guide his sword against the whole world, to Hungarian victory.\n\nAs Dési explained, the sword was also the appropriate tool of both polishing character and defending honor; as he wrote, “from ancient times, the sword is the manifestation of chivalry, the weapon of truth and honor … the sword ennobles, makes thought noble and acts chivalrous.”177\n\nAfter his prayer for Kabos’s victory, Dési wrote, he sang with no less feeling his homeland’s “sacred prayer,” the anthem of Hungary, as well as the Hungarian Creed and the Shehecheyanu [a Jewish prayer recited to celebrate special occasions].178 By recounting the central festive and melancholic texts of Hungarians and Jews, Dési reaffirmed his dual national identity and went on to demonstrate the inextricable tie between Jewish and Hungarian fates. As he wrote,\n\nthis world famous, glorious triumph showing the superiority of the Hungarian genius will at the same time illuminate the dim consciousness of the world, and they will be ashamed, and it will rectify that they had made servants to lords over us in the robbed parts of the country…. Within the narrow borders of Trianon the Hungarian sun will rise and with its light will chase back to their dens the monsters that ventured out, and will melt together with its warmth the interdependents of one-fate, the sons of our one Homeland, the children of one Nation.179\n\nAs per its usual strategy, Egyenlőség also interviewed Kabos’s family; his father, who “had always been a man of deep Jewish sentiments,” revealed that he had written on the “Hungarian Question” in the Successor States and expressed sadness over the Numerus Clausus that led his son not to apply to university. “This is the Hungarian Jewish father!” Egyenlőség exclaimed.\n\nIn addition to racist ideologues, many of the Jewish journalists and periodicals found the emphasis of Egyenlőség on Jewish Olympians exaggerated and regarded it as harmful to Hungarian Jewry as a whole. When, for instance, Nemzet Szava criticized the sports leadership for allowing Kabos to carry the standard of the Hungarian team, a paper of a Jewish editor denounced the attack, yet it advised Egyenlőség to refrain from initiating interfaith debates, by “religious chest-beating that could not only hurt the sensibilities of people of other faiths but also undermine the united Hungarian national thought.”180 Egyenlőség refused the attempts of the press to teach them a lesson in representing Jewry, pointing out that their commitment to write in depth on Jewish Olympians dates back to 1928 and comparing the assaults to the ungrounded accusations questioning the number of Jewish war heroes in the early 1920s.181\n\nAnother attack against Kabos appeared in the extreme rightist newspaper Magyar Jövő [Hungarian Future]. The paper remarked in its report on the Olympics that “The triumphal haze is somewhat bitter, since, of all people, Kabos won, but still better than an Italian victory.”182 Társadalmunk [Our Society], a journal edited by an influential centrist journalist of Jewish origins, reproached the slanderous sentence, warning that “This is not indiscreetness or tastelessness anymore but, in our view, an assassination … committed against the unity of the nation. This is a Balkanic, un-Hungarian voice and we refuse this in order to draw the attention of the Hungarian world to the evildoings of well-poisoners!”183 Eventually, Kabos himself replied in a newspaper, swearing to mar those few who sympathize with the statements of the author who had dishonored him.184\n\nThe journal of Ede Kurländer, a wealthy Jewish lawyer and belletrist, also joined the debate. In a series of articles, it developed the argument that Hungarian Jewish Olympians did not represent “members of the Jewish faith,” but won as Hungarians, and hence recounting their names was unnecessary, since Jews’ “shield and sword is the Bible of our ancestors.”185 Not only interfaith relations were considered irrelevant in the Olympic context, but the results also entirely disproved racial theories; neither religious nor ethnic affiliation was accepted as a category of analysis; the sole context of the Olympics was the nation.186 After Egyenlőség was criticized by so many Jewish journals, it is hardly surprising that in the interpretation of Nemzet Szava, their attack on Egyenlőség was justified by the fact that “Jewish newspaper-relatives also rushed to haul Egyenlőség over the coal.”187\n\nAs for the official press, the journal of the Levente Movement republished the article of Horthy’s Guardist celebrating “the most skillful, most triumphant nation of the great ancient Turanian race,” and praised the disproportionate success of its representatives.188 The xenophobic edge of verbal and written ovations of Hungarian race was only blunted by the Regent’s symbolic handshakes. In late September 1936, Horthy decorated every Olympic champion with the newly established Toldi Memorial Prize, regardless of confession or ethnicity; six of them were Jewish.189 The warm words about the Hungarian race addressed to the champions of the last Olympics before the war were an eerie foreboding of the fate of one of them. At the event, the head of the Ministry of Culture’s Sports Department applauded the fact that\n\neven the people of the Hungarian steppe, formerly disinterested in sports, noticed…. that by these victories we overtook other enormous and large nations. The national importance of sports came to the foreground, the suffering nation of our dismembered little country welcomed the news of Hungarian victories as the breaking of dawn after a hopelessly long night…. Lo, our race is not fallible! Our people is not among the last!190\n\nBetween 1896 and 1936, out of the fifty-eight Hungarian Olympic champions sixteen were Jewish. Hungarian champions brought home eighty gold medals overall, of which the sixteen Jewish athletes claimed twenty-seven, while their forty-two non-Jewish counterparts won fifty-three. Out of twenty-seven individual gold medals won by Hungarians, Jewish sportsmen received nine, and they were also prominently involved in every team championship—those of five sabre and two water polo teams. The figures indicating Hungarian Jewish sportsmen’s significance in the context of Jewish sports are no less impressive: forty-two Jewish sportsmen won at the Olympics where Hungary participated, that is, excluding the 1920 Olympics. More than a third of them, sixteen, were Hungarian. At these nine Olympics, Jewish sportsmen won twenty-two individual and thirty-six team medals. About half of these were won by Hungarian Jews—nine and nineteen, respectively191 [Fig. 4].\n\nTHE AFTERLIFE OF SUCCESS\n\nAfter the First Jewish Law came to force in 1938, Egyenlőség was discontinued, along with numerous other of Jewish-owned journals. The balance of the debate tilted toward the Parliament, and the Jewish Olympians’ achievements gained significance in the context of the fight for civil rights. The economic aspects of the Olympics were discussed in the Parliament a number of times before 1936. In this context, Gyula Gömbös spoke up against sending too many sportsmen to the Olympics in 1924. He ridiculed the controversies surrounding the selection of athletes to the sabre team, and the presence of players on the soccer team who were “representatives of the Magyar race; gentlemen, who had been members of Maccabi Brno.” Instead of elevating professional sportsmen, Gömbös suggested “drawing from the deep well of talents” in the countryside, and promoting mass sports.192 After the Amsterdam Games, the editor of Nemzet Szava, Representative Meskó, criticized Hungarian cultural and sports luminaries who had not Magyarized their names, mentioning prominently the fencers: Fuchs, Petschauer, and the Greek Glykais.193\n\nSince participation at the Los Angeles Games looked exceedingly costly for Hungarian athletes, a number of representatives encouraged the government to finance the Olympic team. Tivadar Homonnay, the Christian socialist president of the National Swimming Association, portrayed the Games as the only opportunity to revive respect for the impoverished but noble Hungarian state, and hence a matter of “national interest.” As he put it,\n\nwe can indeed prove that this nation is destined to success, has vitality and ability…. the most opportune way to do so is through sports. The most opportune; indeed, unfortunately, under the present conditions Olympics is almost the only one…. Hungary is a great power in European sports. In addition, Hungarian sportsmen enjoy popularity everywhere, thanks to their splendid and gentlemanly style…. during the Olympic competitions in Europe, not only in sports newspapers, but also in political ones, the headlines described the high degree of development of Hungarian sports, and thus the aptitude, vitality, and stamina of Hungarian power and the Magyar race, in sports as well as in other respects.194\n\nA few months later Kálmán Shvoy, the former army officer from Szeged, whose reverence for Jewish war heroes already cost him his career, also advocated financing the team, so that “it can bear the criticism of the whole civilized world.”195 Although sixth place of Hungary at the Los Angeles Games was certainly an overachievement, the Hungarian Olympic Team rose highest in Berlin, and the response was not long in coming.\n\nIn November 1936, János Vázsonyi—son of the Jewish Representative Vilmos Vázsonyi, whose duel Egyenlőség likely prevented in 1892—appealed to the government regarding the issue of the construction of the national stadium. Apart from advocating the development of sports for the sake of demonstrating Hungarian vitality, he alluded to the role sports played in enabling Jews to demonstrate their patriotism. Vázsonyi reminded his audience in the House of Representatives of “the results of the [Hungarian Olympians’] fight in Berlin…. [which] not only are the successes of physical education and sports, but are also the universal successes of the Hungarian nation, and foreign policy successes, which have made the name of Hungarians more popular and achieved for it more glory than years of diplomacy, in the bygone days as much as in the recent past.”196 Vázsonyi cautiously outlined the asymmetrical warfare effect of Hungarian foreign policy, thereby evoking the relation between Jews and non-Jews:\n\nThe achievements of a small country are always of more significance [Vázsonyi observed] each and every achievement on the international level, in my view, worth more and has more impact on the future and the present of the country than a hundred malicious articles, a thousand instigating posters, a thousand inflammatory speeches, fly-bills or other combustibles of Hungarian public life.197\n\nVászonyi demanded the conclusions of the recent Olympics be drawn, most importantly, that “no one should desire to incite hatred in this country between countryside and city,” since the “Budapest boys” had cleansed the name of “sinful Budapest.” Finally, he also insisted that there should be no “confessional discrimination” against Olympians and called for its eradication in other walks of life, particularly in light of recent fights at universities. Lastly, Vázsonyi again recalled the moments of victory, a dignified opportunity for “saying to ourselves the national prayer, the first verse of which ends with ‘This nation has expiated for past and future.’”198 The overlapping Hungarian and Jewish plights in Vázsonyi’s words and the desire to overcome the dual humiliation through gentlemanly fight were unmistakable.\n\nIn December 1936, news appeared in the Basel newspaper National Zeitung that the names of Kárpáti and Kabos would not be inscribed in the Olympiastadion [Berlin, Germany’s Olympic Stadium]. Kabos refused to comment, but Kárpáti disputed the rumor.199 In July, Kabos was again left out of the team traveling to the Paris World Championship, which immediately invited speculations, although the president of the National Fencing Association rushed to refute allegations.200 However, when Petschauer, by now a journalist, interviewed Kabos, the latter complained that he should have been invited, despite his absence from the national competition; Kabos also spoke discreetly of certain insults, but defiantly declared, referring to the Arrow Cross party, that “insult-arrows cannot shoot the sabre out of my hand.”201 The Centrist Társadalmunk [Our Society] extoled the elegance with which Kabos brushed off the provocateurs and promised that the “Fuchses, Petschauers and Kaboses of the future will be there on the piste as well, whenever in any part of the world the nations of the world will have to be submitted to the Hungarian sabre!”202\n\nA lengthy parliamentary debate took place between April and May 1938 on the First Jewish Law, titled “For a More Efficient Safeguard of Equilibrium in Social and Economic Life,” which limited Jewish participation in a number of professions to 20%.203 At least partly, Hungarian Jews seemed to have acquiesced to the lesser evil, as the government promised to curb the violence of the extreme right and as seemingly even harsher antisemitic measures, governments, and popular opinions gained power in Romania, Austria, and former Czechoslovakia. The Jewish leadership directed its attention to the Hungarian government. They petitioned the Houses, appealed to public opinion by publishing pamphlets and statistics on the role of Jews in building Hungary, and set up a Committee of War Veterans. At the same time, they refused help from the British Foreign Office, and the AIU, which later unilaterally arranged a meeting with the Hungarian ambassador to Paris to express their objections.204 Again, it was Jewish Olympians who were spotlighted as the chief international representatives of both Hungarian Jewry and Hungary.\n\nReferring to two press articles by Petschauer, Vázsonyi again eulogized Jewish Olympians in the House, rebuking representatives and the government for, supposedly, meticulously surveying statistics on some Jews, but not putting forth statistics on Olympians. As he observed, while the older generation of Jewish Olympians will be exempt from the Jewish Law on account of their service on the front, the younger Jewish Olympians “could not have been front soldiers, and nevertheless achieved pomp, fame, and glory for the Hungarian nation.”205 Vázsonyi then went on to recall the Jewish victims of the Red Terror and demonstrated the Jewish role in the development of Hungary through his illustrious family history. On the same day, Representative Hugó Payr, a former national champion wrestler with MTK in 1905, and an Olympian in London with his teammate, the champion Weisz, provided the statistics. According to Payr, thirty-one of the eighty-three Hungarian Olympic gold medals were won by nineteen Jewish sportsmen. Recalling that they had been decorated by Horthy and celebrated “regardless of rank, position, social standing, confession, and race,” he declared the Bill to be an act of “ingratitude, not worthy of the Hungarian nation.”206 The law was adopted three weeks later, and Olympians were not exempt.207 However, the First Jewish Law exempted Jewish front soldiers, their widows and orphans, as well as those who had converted before August 1919, the beginning of White Terror, and their direct descendants who did not return to Judaism. The Second Jewish Law was based on racial grounds to an even larger extent, but again recognized high watermarks of Hungarian patriotism and rootedness.\n\nNearly a year later, in late February 1939, the House of Representatives began debating the bill “On the Restriction of Jewish Conquest of Space in Public and Economic Life,” which became known as the Second Jewish Law from May 1939. Béla Imrédy, prime minister from May 1938, declared that due to the reannexation of territories from Slovakia and Subcarpathia, further anti-Jewish restrictions were necessary.208 Despite fears that it would serve German interests, and the political crisis it caused, the bill eventually passed, decreasing the acceptable rate of Jews in numerous professions to 6%.209 According to the first category of exemptions, only those were exempt who had converted before the White Terror and whose direct ancestors had been born in Hungary no later than the end of the 1848 revolution, January 1849. Most importantly, the law restricted the circle of service-related exemptions: only decorated front soldiers, those killed on duty, counterrevolutionaries, and their families were exempt; the hundreds of thousands of Jewish veterans without decorations were not. The Jewish Committee of War Veterans, including the distinguished champion of art and the art of war, Mező, signaled its protest, but the national Alliance of Front Soldiers supported the proposal, which later turned into law.210 However, while service-related exemptions were restricted, Jewish Olympians’ services to the homeland were recognized by the Second Jewish Law.\n\nA week into the debate in the House of Representatives, Károly Peyer, the leader of the Social Democratic Party, praised Hajós and Fuchs for becoming champions at a time when professional sports did not yet exist in Hungary.211 Two days later the independent Jenő Dulin appealed to reason, referring to himself as a “veteran sportsman.” Speaking of Olympic champions as the perfect example of assimilated Jews, he said: “Once we say about someone that he had testified to his Hungarianhood, we have to accept him as a full-fledged member of our nation…. we cannot say that such a man is a not sufficiently assimilated Hungarian with regard to his behavior and mentality, can we?”212 Dulin recalled the joyous moments of the sabre final, which he had shared with not quite Judaophile army officers, who all cheered when Kabos won. Finally, he asked, “Was there anyone then who would have believed that these people, whom we cheered until we barked ourselves hoarse, whom we greeted with tears in our eyes, will be excluded from the community of the nation?”213\n\nFollowing Dulin’s speech, it was the demoted Szeged officer, Kálmán Shvoy, who first officially proposed a modification to the bill to provide exemption to Jewish Olympians and require that the House honor Jewish Olympic champions “in grateful recognition for fighting at the Olympic Games with the same ardor and will as their Hungarian fellows, for achieving recognition and glory to their homeland, and because in faraway lands the Hungarian prayer intoned and the sacred Hungarian flag ran up the pole after their victories.”214 Vázsonyi followed up three days later, again pointing out that the Olympians were decorated by Horthy himself.215\n\nOn March 13, Payr again rose to speak on the issue of Olympians; in a desperate tone, he exclaimed, “It is impossible that we ostracize the people who had achieved glory for the Hungarian name.”216 Nonetheless, at the first vote three days later, the majority of the House refused providing exemption to Olympians. When the House reconvened on March 16, Minister of Justice András Tasnádi Nagy asked the House to refuse Shvoy’s modification, promising that an exemption for Olympians will be included in a report of a joint commission, to be confirmed in days.217 Indeed, the commission confirmed the exemption of Olympians on the next day.218 On March 21, Payr retold the story of Helene Mayer in the House and asked the Minister of Justice why he wanted to “surpass the nationalism and racial sentiment of Hitler [by persecuting Olympians]?”219 Finally, welcoming the decision of the minister to provide exemption for Olympians, Payr criticized him for ignoring the possibility that Jews may become Olympic champions in the future, leaving no room for such an option in the law. Despite the tragedy that befell Hungarian Jewry, Payr was justified in his optimism.\n\nEPILOGUE\n\nIlona Elek was trained by István Fodor, son of the fencing hall founder Károly Fodor, and faced numerous difficulties due to the lack of interest in women’s sports.220 She and her sister survived the war and began training just as the dust of Budapest settled around them in the spring of 1945.221 Elek went on to win twelve world championship medals, finishing first five times. Repeating her achievement in Berlin, she again became Olympic champion in individual foil in London and came in second in Helsinki.222 Her sister, Margit, also won numerous European and world titles, placed sixth in London, and also fenced in Helsinki.\n\nFive Jewish Olympic champions did not survive the war. Lajos Werkner died in Budapest in November 1943, at the age of sixty.223 Gerde died in the Budapest ghetto in October 1944.224 Garay was deported and murdered in Mauthausen.225 Regardless of his Signum Laudis medals received from Horthy for his Olympic victories, Petschauer was called up for labor service in 1942. The labor service laws exempted only those Jews who had received this medal or other high decorations for their heroism during World War I, or risked their freedom and lives in 1918-1919.226 Petschauer was captured near the Don Bend in January 1943, and he died in the same month.227 Out of 214 Jews in the labor service company in which Petschauer served, only 24 survived. According to some sources, including István Szabó’s movie Sunshine, he was tortured brutally before his death by an army officer who had himself been an Olympian in horse racing.228\n\nThe wrestler Weisz survived the war and began to reorganize his beloved club of half a century in his apartment immediately after the war. He died in December 1945.229 The water polo goalkeeper Barta passed away in Budapest in 1948.230 Földes, the only champion who had left Hungary before World War II, died in Cleveland in 1950.231 Many of the Jewish champions continued to work for the benefit of Hungary, sports, or both. The first champion, Hajós, worked for the Agricultural Planning Institute until his death in 1955.232 Bródy spent two years in labor service, became an official of the Hungarian Swimming Association in 1945, then commercial attaché to the Netherlands, and in 1948 he immigrated to South Africa, where he ran"
