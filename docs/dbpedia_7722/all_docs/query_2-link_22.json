        "text": "Dóra Szekeres: The topic of our conversation is the mysterious fate of Ferenc Molnár's autobiography, titled Companion in Exile – Notes for an Autobiography (Útitárs a száműzetésben. Jegyzetek egy önéletrajzhoz). Researchers to this day believed that the original Hungarian version of this work was lost and that we can only know it in translation. You had the opportunity through an ELTE grant to find the work's original manuscript in New York, where it was preserved in The New York Public Library for the Performing Arts in Lincoln Center. This raises many questions, so let's go through them.\n\nIf I am correct, it was ultimately by accident that you found Ferenc Molnár's believed-to-be-lost manuscript—moreover, you are not known as a Ferenc Molnár researcher, but instead specialize in the lives and works of the female writers of the period. How did Ferenc Molnár's work end up on your radar?\n\nJudit Kádár: For decades I have dealt with female writers who were acclaimed at the turn of the last century, but who fell out of the public literary consciousness after the Second World War, among them Renée Erdős; I initially thought that however talented she was, her career was primarily thanks to the patronage of Sándor Bródy, the lauded \"prince of writers\" at the time. I treated her unfairly, and now I realize that the country girl who arrived in millennial Budapest quickly joined a larger friend group of emerging intellectuals who inspired each other, and following the support of Károly Eötvös, who published her first volume of poetry, the young Ferenc Molnár, Oszkár Jászi, and Ervin Szabó initially tried to steer her toward modern literature. One year before her death in 1956, Erdős wrote a memoir about those early years (which came out only a few years ago under the title Our Youth, \"Ifjúságunk\"). Reading it as autofiction, I found it surprising that among them all it was Ferenc Molnár she remembered most fondly, whom posterity views as a much more contradictory figure. On a first reading of her memoir, which is self-critical but also unsparing of others, it seems baffling that Erdős should write about Molnár specifically with sincere appreciation, while Jaszi Oszkár, who established a successful scholarly career in America and with whom she formerly shared a relationship we would today call \"friends with benefits\", is mentioned almost with contempt. In the interest of solving this mystery, I read the translation of Molnár's Companion in Exile, his autobiographical book published in 1958, on the title page of which they unconventionally added that \"the original manuscript of this work has not been successfully found in New York\". In multiple places in this book, Molnár alludes to a play that was never staged, \"The King’s Maid\" (\"A király szolgálólányá\"), which is about an old, sick Jewish man's conversion to Jesus. I then arrived at the conclusion that perhaps Molnár's late religious journey could explain Erdős's sympathy, because her own deviation from Jewishness caused her serious lifelong trauma. Since the translation didn't seem reliable, for certainty's sake I thought I should see the literary estate preserved in New York, which contains the antecedents to the Hungarian translation of the autobiography and of course the play, of which there is not a single copy in Hungary.\n\nEntry hall of Lincoln Center library: Judit Kádár\n\nHow did you find the Companion in Exile manuscript? You mentioned that Gábor Reichert had already written of the manuscript as a new discovery in 2022, but back then he wrote in his paper that it is in The New York Public Library. This turned out not to be the case. How did you find it in another, I suppose lesser-known library?\n\nJK: It is true that Gábor Reichert first wrote that the Hungarian language manuscript exists. According to his statements, the writer's great-grandson who lives in Los Angeles, Gábor Lukin, informed him that the exact location was the Manuscripts and Archives Division of the library. This was true, but not quite precise enough. (Reichert has still not seen the manuscript himself.) Namely, the Ferenc Molnár estate is not in the famous building of The New York Public Library, but in the institutionally connected Billy Rose Theatre Division of The New York Public Library for the Performing Arts in Manhattan's Upper West Side, in Lincoln Center. Whoever wants to research the material has to be in possession of an NYPL library card and make a visitor's appointment for the reading room in the Library for the Performing Arts.\n\nFerenc Molnár's title page layout for the English edition of Companion\n\nFirst page of the Companion manuscript\n\nMolnár's title page layout for what would eventually be published as Stories for Two\n\nHow did it feel to discover the manuscript and realize it was the original? What made you realize that this was it?\n\nI had already known from the internet that Companion's original Hungarian language manuscript existed, because by 2004 American experts had already compiled the index of the material found in the estate, but since they presumably did not understand Hungarian, someone had to take it into their own hands to establish that it was in fact the manuscript of this work. When I saw it, I immediately recognized Molnár's characteristic handwriting, albeit shakier than usual, but the text's content more-or-less completely corresponded with the reverse-translated Hungarian version. It was a great honor, a gift of fate, that after his great-grandson I was probably the first Hungarian reader to see the manuscript, which Ferenc Molnár himself gifted to the NYPL as part of his estate.\n\nResearch room of the Library for the Performing Arts and one of twenty boxes containing Molnár's estate\n\nThe work was published in English in New York in 1950—what do we know about the English translator?\n\nBarrows Mussey was a New York journalist and translator who brought German literature and later many German-language magic books into English. In 1948, his translation of Lion Feuchtwanger's Wahn oder Der Teufel in Boston (The Devil In Boston), a play about the Salem witch trials condemning the persecution of stigmatized people – Feuchtwanger had emigrated to the United States to escape the Nazis – was staged in New York right when Molnár, who was in a similar life situation, was working on his memoirs, and perhaps this theater piece gave him the idea of asking Mussey to do the translation. It is highly likely that the American man did not know Hungarian, and this is why Molnár translated the Hungarian manuscript of Companion in Exile into German for him—presumably this is the German version the Petőfi Literary Museum recently purchased. But we can’t rule out the possibility that Molnár prepared that German version for a 1953 publication, released in Bavaria with the title Gefährtin im Exil. Even the National Széchényi Library doesn't have a copy of this German-language book, and the academic literature practically only knows the title.\n\nAfter the American publication in the 1950s, Companion In Exile was published in Hungary in 1958. It’s not the original text we can read, however, but rather Adorján Stella's reverse translation from the English, which was not considered very good. Now comparing the original with the translated text, what can researchers see?\n\nIf the earlier inference is correct, that is, that Stella reverse translated the English translation of the German translation of the Hungarian, then it is surprising that it almost completely corresponds to the original text. Something could have easily happened with Molnár's autobiography like what happened with Ady's poem in Frigyes Karinthy's humorous essay \"Translation\" (\"Műfordítás\"), where Ady's lines \"I came from the banks of the Ganges / Where I daydreamed in the midday sun\" after back-and-forth Hungarian-German translations ended up as: \"In the Herz sausage / The salt is much denser\". But to confirm this inference that Mussey translated the work from German into English, and that Stella later translated the English into Hungarian, the known versions – fortunately four of them now – will have to be carefully compared.\n\nHow much did Ferenc Molnár's Hungarian change by the time of the work's creation? Does the text indirectly tell us anything about this?\n\nMany have claimed that in the 12 years of his American emigration he never properly learned English. Based on the manuscript, this does not appear to be true; in fact, he knew it so well that more than once he put an acceptable English equivalent in parentheses at the end of the Hungarian sentence for a given word or expression, in all certainty in order to help the future translator. But it also occurs that he wrote certain words only in English. For example, he used the term \"self-pity\" throughout the text, obviously because it came to him in English. Adorján Stella rather unfortunately translated this expression to önszánalom (\"self-compassion\") in Hungarian instead of önsajnálat, and due to this kind of clumsiness many thought the translation was worse than it now seems to be in light of the Hungarian language manuscript.\n\nAdjorán Stella's name may be less well-known these days among readers, but in addition to being a well-known journalist, humorist, and playwright, he also translated. Among other things we can thank him for the script for the film Janika. What was his relationship with Ferenc Molnár?\n\nAdorján Stella, born in 1897, was a successful comic playwright following in Molnár's footsteps, well-liked in Budapest intelligentsia circles, and according to his contemporaries \"lived his life between New York City and the old New York coffeehouse\". As such, it's conceivable that he first met Molnár in the coffeehouse. They were friends, Stella knew both Molnár and his works well, and he collected the writer's anecdotes through the end of his life so that he could publish them in German. His untimely death prevented him from realizing his plan; there is unfortunately no trace of such a book, although a journalist living in Israel, Pál Benedek, saw with his own eyes the substantial Hungarian-language manuscript referencing the anecdotes titled Thousand and One Nights with Ferenc Molnár — if only it were just hiding deep in some desk drawer!\n\nWe know of Ferenc Molnár's international success, we know that he was one of the Hungarian artists who were highly regarded not only at home but also abroad after their emigration. This is more so a nice-sounding surface layer, however, and underneath we find many failures. How did Ferenc Molnár experience those years, and what was his relationship with Hungary? What do researchers find in this regard when examining the works he produced in America?\n\nMolnár wrote in Companion that he \"abandoned his homeland in 1923\". Thus, according to his own assessment, when he arrived in the USA, where he never truly desired to go, he had already been living in voluntary exile for seventeen years. Following the dissolution of the Austro-Hungarian Empire, he was increasingly subjected to anti-Semitic attacks, from which he fled first to German-language territories like Berlin and Vienna. When Hitler came to power, he sought refuge in French and Italian cities, in the \"Latin West\" in his terms. But nowhere felt right, his heart ached for the Budapest that had become a global city during his youth, and it caused him particular pain that wherever he turned, the world-famous Hungarian writer was respected for his persona and his homeland while his Hungarianness was called into question. The guilt from learning of the deaths of friends and acquaintances murdered in the Second World War tormented him. As he put it in his autobiographical novel about the first years of his emigration to New York, God Be With You, My Dear (Isten veled szívem), published first in English in 1945 and then in Hungarian two years later: \"I almost felt it a crime that my life remained just because I was lucky and escaped. … I feel like a cheater, who with a clever trick paid fewer dues to history than he should have paid.\"\n\nWhat role did the dilemma between the Christian and Jewish identity play in Ferenc Molnár's life? People in no way think of Ferenc Molnár as having works with deep metaphysical themes. However, as you mentioned, his final play The King's Maid has an explicitly religious subject, though this interpretation is less known. How did this come to be?\n\nLike his father, Molnár attended the Református Gimnázium (Reformed Church High School) on Lónyay Street in Budapest, where he still had a single \"Israelite\" religion class once a week, but he received an Evangelical upbringing at home. In the still-tolerant atmosphere of the turn of the century, it certainly had an effect on him that several of his friends and loved ones converted to the Catholic or Reformed faith in the interest of assimilation. Having attentively followed the fate of Renée Erdős, for whom the rejection of Orthodox Jewish traditions and acceptance of Catholic doctrine caused immense suffering, he would have been perfectly aware of what sort of traumas come with a change in identity. But the question occupied him his entire life: he had already written a Christian mystery play in 1933 that mirrored the effect of Erdős's works of Catholic spirit, titled Miracle Between the Mountains (Csoda a hegyek között).\n\nHe had already started the aforementioned play \"The King's Maid\", in which the King is none other than Jesus, during the Second World War, later reworking it in 1951, but it never made it to the stage as Molnár died in the middle of an operation a year later. In the play's preface it can be read that the work is a \"profession of faith\", and it truly is, in two senses of the word. On the one hand it testifies that by the end of his life, Ferenc Molnár had become a deeply devout person who believed in Jesus; that is, that despite his Jewish religion he had become a Christian. On the other hand, it is a profession of faith in a political sense as well, since the Jewish main character doesn't leave the Jewish religion—just as Molnár did not—because he would have considered it cowardice, abandonment of those persecuted for their faith. This final play was Molnár's stand against Nazism, fascism, and antisemitism. I believe the field did not pay attention to this because the considered-to-be-final English-language typescript is in the New York estate, which was inaccessible to Hungarian researchers until the end of the Cold War. Furthermore, literary studies has just now begun to engage with identity crises and their effects, which the assimilating writers who played pioneering roles in the creation of Hungarian modernism had to live through.\n\nBesides Companion did you make other discoveries in New York?\n\nIn the estate, I found German—or in the case of two works, Hungarian—handwritten manuscripts for eighteen theatrical scenes of Molnár's. The English translation of these was also published in the USA in the 1950s under the title Stories for Two, but there is no Hungarian edition as of yet. Of the eighteen theatrical scenes, seventeen have Hungarian antecedents, although all of these are prose works, mostly short vignettes about the beginning of Molnár's career. Certainly he dramatized them in German from the outset because he did not know a translator who knew Hungarian well enough. The translator's name does not appear in the volume published in New York, but in multiple instances in the manuscript he provided translation comments addressed to Mr. Mussey. Thus, in addition to Companion in Exile, it was the American journalist who in all certainty translated the theatrical scenes into English as well. These eighteen short theatrical scenes count as an entirely new work of Molnár's, not only because of the new genre for the old writings, but because he also tried to transplant them to an American setting.\n\nHow do you think the Hungarian public opinion will react to this discovery?\n\nThis discovered material is significant from the vantage point of Molnár’s entire body of work, since we knew very little about his belief in God or his open stance against Nazism that served as the subject of some of his works. I hope that following the analysis of the estate, sooner or later a more impartial, thorough, and scientifically rigorous biography emerges, as Ferenc Molnár, even today, is one of Hungary’s most esteemed writers known the world over.\n\nThis interview was originally conducted by Dóra Szekeres for Litera.
