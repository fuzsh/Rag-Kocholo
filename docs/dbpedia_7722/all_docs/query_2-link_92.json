        "text": "(Feb, 2014) - My name is Stephen \"Stephenm52\" Molnar and I was born in Providence, Rhode Island. I've spent most of my life in Rhode Island. I originally worked in sales first working for the local Steinway Piano and Hammond organ dealer then went on the road for 25 years as a sales rep in the consumer goods field. Eventually, in my late 40s, I went back to school to study computer and networking technology. For the last 15 years, I was the MIS manager at a law firm in the suburbs of Boston, Ma. I retired in December 2013.\n\nFor the last 7 years I've also played gigs mainly at senior centers on a part time basis. With retirement here, I have more time than ever to enjoy my Yamaha arrangers and to get out to play more gigs.\n\nI started taking piano lessons at 11 years old and in my late teens my interest grew in music after listening to pianists Oscar Peterson and Keith Emerson of Emerson, Lake and Palmer.\n\nThru the last 7 years I've owned, then sold quite a few arrangers, first starting with the PSR 3000, Tyros2, S900, S910. In between and for a couple of years played Korg arrangers. Got back into the Yamaha camp with the purchase of my Tyros4. Finally in 2013 Yamaha announced the Tyros5 in a 76-key model, I had been waiting for years for a 76-key model and purchased one. Then, in 2017 with the release of Genos, I moved up to the Genos, which in my opinion is the best arranger Yamaha has produced.Â\n\nThis PSR site is a great resource and I've always been of the belief that I learned more here in 3 months than I could have learned on my own in year. The learning process continues.\n\nNote: OnÂ June 15, 2023, Stephen passed away after a long battle with cancer.\n\nSteve's MIDI Song Index\n\nSteve provided 30 songs in midi format.
