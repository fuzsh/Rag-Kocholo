        "text": "About the artist:\n\nBorn in Oroshaza, Hungary in 1896 and died in Balatonfured, Hungary in 1989. He was a painter and goldsmith. He began his studies at the College of Applied Arts in Budapest, where his talents rapidly earned him a scholarship to the Munich Academy of Painting under the tutelage of Carl von Marra. He then studied with Masters Oscar Glatz and Bertalan Karlovszky at the Budapest Academy of Fine Arts. His exhibition of early paintings at the Budapest Art Hall led to an invitation by the Arts Alliance of Austria for a solo exhibition at the Kunsthalle in Vienna, followed by solo exhibitions in Paris, Rome, Moscow and St. Petersburg. He was an excellent portraitist and genre painter, and his fascination with the landscape and peasant life around Lake Balaton increasingly occupied his attention and formed his main themes. His works were often exhibited at the Ernest Museum in Budapest. His most notable paintings are “Potato Gatherers,” “Bakony Forest,” “Portrait of Joseph Berda,” “The Shepherds of Szentes,” and “Stormy Lake.”"
