        "text": "My grandma was the one in the family who had strong connection with the “invisible” and \"unexplainable\" world. She also practised alternative healing and we had a very strong connection. My first crystals also came from her.\n\nI was born with a feeling. A feeling of being different. Different in some unexplainable way, and for long time I did not know what it was but I always believed in something greater than \"only\" physical life...\n\nIt took me 30 years to figure it out but finally all became crystal clear when I turned towards higher point of views (spirituality and healing).\n\nI realised...there is so much to the invisible world, there is so much out there I don't actually see with the naked eye BUT I know it is there. It is everywhere!\n\nIt is everything!\n\nIt is my connection with \"The Creator\", with the higher forces.\n\n​\n\nThis is what I connect with and connect you during the Healing sessions. This pure loving frequency let's the body to heal itself (self healing).\n\n​\n\nUp to now healing become my mission,\n\nmy passion. Healing is what I love to do and I will keep doing it.\n\nWhat is “synergy” means?\n\nTwo or more substance (in my case healing methods) combined together to have a greater effect than their separate effect.\n\n​\n\nIn Synergy Healing I use different traditional healing techniques along with Quantum (DNA) Healing and many “secret” tools supported with a crystal chakra bed which I made, so the nature is also fully present on every session with specific crystals.\n\n​\n\nThe healing is very complex.\n\nDuring the session I touch different points of the body which are gateways to the body’s inner core, to the soul and the DNA \"memory\" field.\n\n​\n\nSynergy Healing works on the cellular / DNA(quantum) level where “damaged” information can be corrected. On this level we are able to overwrite traumas, limiting beliefs, blockages, any health related issues or basically anything which can limit our our overall well being.\n\n​\n\nBefore the session there is always a consultation about the issue, health problem or emotional difficulty. That will give the focus for the treatment.\n\n​\n\nSynergy is very gentle, loving, caring...,yet very powerful technique.\n\nA complete session takes about 90 minutes including consultation.\n\n​\n\n​\n\nTo read more see session.\n\nI have been doing healing regularly since 2012. Along that time I have came across with many\n\ndifferent stories, illnesses, symptoms and cases. My approach is always the same with every client.\n\nI am not looking for answers and not trying to figure it out why something is happening.\n\nMy focus is always the cause (root) of the problem even thought I do not have to know what it is and where is connects to.\n\nI only have to release the root of the issue (this is the quantum DNA level). If there is no root it means there is no physical or emotional issues any more.\n\nThe healing session is just the starting point in the process. In some cases the effect is instant but in some cases changes will occur days after the session.\n\nIt is like a computer when we reboot the system. I take out old, worn, unnecessary information and upload new files. This can take some time while the body adopts to the new information.\n\nI believe if You make decision...wishing and wanting for changes and You are willing to flow with the new coming things in Your life.... Than this is a good place to start."
