Yerxa, Editors\n\nPresident's Corner | On the Edge of the World | The Greek Age of Heroes |\n\nAfrican Encounters | Interview with Peter Nabokov | Globalization and Its Critics | Hungary's \"Great Generation\"\n\nThe Pacific War and Civilizational Conflict | The Cambridge Histories | 2002 Conference | Regional Reports | Letters\n\nPresidents Corner\n\nby George Huppert\n\nThe recent conference we sponsored in Atlanta was successful in a number of ways. Those who were there will remember the pleasant setting and some of the more striking presentations, including those of David Landes and Seymour Drescher, which provoked long bouts of debate. Natalie Daviss paper was another high point.\n\nEach of us, no doubt, came away with new ideas, but what I found particularly memorable was the congenial and stimulating mood that reigned throughout those three days, when we had so many opportunities for getting to know each other between formal sessions.\n\nThis mood is something worth maintaining at our next national conference. There is, elsewhere in this issue, a formal Call for Papers for the 2004 conference. This may seem far away, but proposals are actually due pretty soon, with a final deadline in December. You will note that the ground rules are different this time.\n\nOur past conferences have been focused, more or less successfully, on a single theme. Even so, most of us have hardly been jolted out of our routine, basically doing what we have done at other meetings, that is, presenting the results of our own research in company with two or three others on the panels, whose interests are compatible with our own. The result was predictable: a handful of medievalists, for instance, or specialists in Mesopotamian archeology, attended their own sessions, while others plunged into equally exclusive sessions. However interesting the presentations were, one could hardly argue that there was much of a meeting of minds across the thin walls separating these sessions.\n\nSeveral of my colleagues commented on this fact. Meanwhile, at a meeting in Chicago, the three historians to whom I entrusted the direction of the 2004 conference had already expressed their desire to overcome the kind of compartmentalization that plagues our profession.\n\nWhat we hope to see happen when we next meet in BoothbayHarbor is a new kind of conference at which we all learn from each other. We would like to see, for instance, specialists in U.S. colonial history meet with colleagues who study other colonial histories. Another way of shaking loose the rigid boundaries to which we are accustomed would be to devote a general discussion to the concept of the Middle Ages, for instance, or to examine the nature of Western Civilization courses. Could we have economic historians, regardless of their regional or chronological territory, take a look at Africa since independence? Why not venture into controversial or unexamined questions and ask whether historical research can be useful to government policy makers, especially at this juncture, when the West is the target for such concentrated rage? Is there anything wrong with selecting topics for research that are directly related to current preoccupations? Lucien Febvre, the fiery editor of Annales, did not think so. He spoke of a managed history, une histoire dirigée, and went about commissioning a series of articles that tried to provide answers to the perplexities of his daythe 1929 Wall Street Crash, for instance.\n\nWithin reason, I urge you to connect your own expertise with broader issues. We are not just calling for comparative history. We would like to take stock, to ask where our discipline is heading, by prompting a number of reports from the field. What is going on in your own field, as you see it?\n\nYou will have noticed the emphasis on conversation and discussions in the wording of the Call for Papers. We mean that. We are moving away from the established model of presentation (three 20 minute papers, a commentator, and very little time for meaningful discussion). Instead, we ask for your text in advance, and expect only a brief informal summary before a general discussion begins.\n\nA word about the setting of this conference. The inn is not a convention hotel, even though it provides excellent meeting rooms, accommodations, and meals. No need for suits and ties. High heels would be positively life threatening on the lawns, decks and rocks.\n\nThe informal nature of this conference will allow participants a great deal of latitude. We will entertain full-scale presentations in a 300-seat auditorium, as well as brief reports, which will also have their place in the published program. And there is nothing wrong with coming to the conference without putting yourself formally on the program. Join the conversation. I hope to see you all there.\n\nGeorge Huppert is president of the Historical Society and professor of history at the University of Illinois at Chicago.

It is an idyllic place, a granite headland with stunning views out to sea across the estuary of the river Léguer. The air is clear and there are always present the inexorable rhythms of the sea underscoring the timelessness of it all. For the excavation team its a welcome contrast to tourist-clogged Oxfordchoking in its Midlands river valley. But our seasonal translation is more than just a change of air; its a major shift in our cognitive geography. From Le Yaudet we can begin to share the experience of the hundreds of generations who have used the headland: the sense of being in a liminal place between land and seathe wooded environment of land behind, difficult and intricate, the open sea in front, deceptively inviting, and the zone of our existence with its reassuring array of resources there for the gathering from the wide littoral, the woodland fringes, the river, and the ocean.\n\nFor archaeologists and historians it is important to try to understand the cognitive geographies of people in the past. Greek geographers like Hecataeus and Herodotus held very distinct views of the world. Understandably, the Mediterranean occupied the center. Around it were land masses stretching to the unknown and encircling it all, the Ocean. The Graeco-Roman view was a very simple core-periphery model. And so strong was this view, reinforced by generations of schoolteachers in the 19th and 20th centuries, that it still pervades even today. There is, of course, good reason for this. Much of the Mediterranean littoral was a benign environment where communities could flourish, and the sea itselfMare Nostrumprovided an easy means of communication. Those favored locations that grew into major ports-of-call, places like Miletus, soon became information nodes where ideas flourished and fermented. FernandBraudel summed it up with his characteristic verve in The Mediterranean in the Ancient World when he wrote:\n\nThe best witness to the Mediterraneans age-old past is the sea itself. This has to be said again and again: and the sea has to be seen and seen again . . . . So we find that our sea was from the very dawn of its prehistory a witness to those imbalances productive of change which would set the rhythm of its entire life.\n\nImbalances productive of change lie at the very heart of what prehistory and history are about. Since resources, populations, and ideas are scattered unevenly, there is a constant flow from one region to another. Where there is access to the sea, the intensity of flow is all the greater. And so it was that for a brief period of 2000 years or so the Mediterranean became a hothouse for cultural development.\n\nBut to place such emphasis on the Mediterranean is to introduce an imbalance. There were other ocean fringes, rich in resources, with their different rhythms of interaction creating quite distinctive, and often brilliantly inventive, cultures of their own. One of these is the long Atlantic fringe of Europe stretching from Morocco in the south to Iceland in the north. Far from being a raggle-taggle of benighted barbarians deprived by geography from enjoying the benefits of Mediterranean civilization, the Atlantic arc was a world of its own and well able to make a unique contribution to European history.\n\nUntil the 15th century A.D., the Atlantic communities conceived of themselves as being on the edge of the world. What was out there in the ocean lay in the realms of myth: the Hesperides, Atlantis, the Isles of the Blessed. Even after the voyages of discovery of the 16th century, mysterious but non-existent islands constantly appeared on charts. Indeed, it was not until as late as 1865 that the mythical island of Hy Brazil, supposed to lie off the west coast of Ireland, was finally removed from official naval charts.\n\nThis sense of being at the very limit, where land and sea met, cannot have failed to create a particular mindset, while the rhythms of the monthly tidal cycles and the inevitability of the daily ebb and flow of the sea would have given those who viewed it an intimate sense of the passage of time and the associated significance of celestial movements. In other words, the cognitive geography of those facing the ocean would have been quite different from that of an inland dweller or those hardly noticing the sluggish movements of the Mediterranean.\n\nThat the coastal communities built oceangoing ships and mastered the essentials of navigation is beyond dispute, but when sea-going first became a way of life is more difficult to say. However, by the 6th millennium B.C. it is evident that Mesolithic foragers occupying the coasts had taken to the sea to fish and were probably following the shoals of fish in the same way that hunters on land would have followed the herds of animals. It was probably at this time that navigation skills were learned, and voyages lasting days or weeks would have brought the fishermen into contact with more distant communities. In this way, through networks of social interaction, ideas and beliefs would have been shared. Some such mechanism would explain the striking similarities seen in Mesolithic burial practice in such disparate places as Denmark, Brittany, and Portugal, where bodies were carefully laid out in graves cut into shell middens and adorned with red ochre and deer antlers. While the distances traveled by individual communities may have been comparatively limited, the overall effect of these networks of interaction, functioning over long periods of time, would have been to create elements of a common maritime culture.\n\nBy the middle of the 5th millennium the concepts and technologies of cereal cultivation and animal husbandry, which originated in the Near East, were beginning to reach the Atlantic coastal zone. Food production, as opposed to gathering, enhanced the stability of the already sedentary coastal populations, and there emerged the remarkable phenomenon of collective burial in large megalithic tombs. Tombs of this kind, called passage graves, where the bones of ancestors were collected together, appear in the Tagus region of Portugal and in Brittany toward the middle of the 5th millennium, and by the end of the 4th millennium the idea had spread to Ireland and Britain as far north as the Orkney Islands. Although there was regional variation, the basic architectural concept is the same throughout the maritime zone. No less impressive is the considerable similarity in the range of symbols carved or painted on the stones, and the fact that some of the tombs are carefully aligned on celestial phenomena such as the rising or setting of the sun on the solstices. What we are seeing here is a vivid reflection of a sharing of beliefs along the length of the entire Atlantic zone growing out of and enhancing the network of contacts established 2000 years earlier.\n\nSome insight into the actual mechanisms at work is given by the distribution of polished stone axes, many of which have been petrographically identified and can therefore be traced to their source. These, it is believed, were used as gifts in complex cycles of exchange much like the Kula ring of the western Pacific studied by the anthropologist Malinowski. On the island of Jersey, one of the British Channel Islands, 28% of the axes found came from Brittany and 16% from Normandy even though the island had its own source of desirable stone which was widely exported, especially to the neighboring island of Guernsey where 31% of the axes found were from Jersey. None of this makes sense in terms of simple trade but is easily explicable in terms of cycles of exchange in which the axes were prestige gifts constantly being exchanged among elites. One can imagine these social expeditions setting out by ships along prearranged routes, maintaining social harmony with the exchange of symbolic gifts and at the same time indulging in the more normal trade of bulk commodities.\n\nThe Atlantic facade was well-provided with rare resources, those imbalances productive of change: tin in Cornwall, Brittany, and Galicia; gold in Galicia and southeast Ireland; copper in southwest Ireland, western Britain, and western Iberia; rare attractive varieties of stone, most particularly amber along the coasts of Jutland; and salt, easily obtainable in many low-lying coastal regions. All these commodities and many others moved through the exchange networks of the Atlantic. As bronze came more widely into use, so the Atlantic zone was drawn more slowly into the continental networks. The great rivers, Tagus, Duro, Garonne, Loire, Seine, and Rhine, provided convenient corridors along which commodities together with knowledge of beliefs and technologies could pass.\n\nBy the end of what is conventionally known as the Late Bronze Age, about 800 B.C., the intensity of maritime movement, reflected in the distribution of bronze weapons and tools, must have been very considerable. Distinctive itemsthe Irish spearhead found in the sea off Huelva in southwest Spain or the Sicilian axe found near Hengistbury on the Dorset coasttraveled long distances. What is even more impressive is the similarity of the value systems adopted throughout the length of this huge region and expressed in the weapon sets of the elites and the feasting gearcauldrons, flesh hooks, and roasting spitsthey used in their social gatherings. It is difficult to resist the view that by the opening centuries of the 1st millennium B.C. a distinctive Atlantic community had emerged.\n\nIt was about 800 B.C. that the Atlantic system and the Mediterranean system began to interact directly. The moment came when a group of Phoenician merchants from the eastern end of the Mediterranean, mostly modern Lebanon, set up a trading colony on the island of Gadir (now Cadiz) just off the Atlantic coast of southern Spain to trade with the local Tartessians, particularly for the silver the latter produced in great quantity. Gadir was the linchpin that locked the two oceans together, and it was not long before Phoenicians were exploring the Atlantic coasts for themselves, setting up trading colonies down the African coast of Morocco and up the Iberian coasts of Portugal to take over the supply of African gold and ivory and Galician tin. The appearance of these alien vessels in Atlantic waters no doubt introduced many changes, and it is even possible that the indigenous shipbuilding tradition in this way learned the benefits of the sail.\n\nThe Atlantic was a source of fascination for Mediterranean sailors. Phoenicians and Greeks alike began to explore the alien waters. Hanno, a famous Phoenician explorer, may have got as far south as Cameroon in west Africa in the 5th century, and at the end of the 4th century a Greek called Pytheas from the Mediterranean port of Massalia (Marseilles) set out to explore the north Atlantic, quite probably using local shipping. He visited Brittany and tin-producing southwest Britain before circumnavigating the island, visiting en route the amber-bearing coast of Jutland. It is even possible that he got as far as Iceland. These travelers, and no doubt others about whom history is silent, brought back to the Mediterranean stories of the mysterious ocean and its barbarian inhabitants to amuse, excite, and entice.\n\nThe developing contact between the Mediterranean and the Atlantic was slow at first, but after Caesars conquest of Gaul in the 1st century B.C. and the conquest of Britain a century later the Atlantic was opened up to Roman shipping. Some Mediterranean vessels undoubtedly faced the fierce Atlantic, as an anchor stock dredged up off north Wales shows, but for the most part the Atlantic seaborne traffic was in the hands of local seamen who used vessels built in a native tradition. The late Roman cargo ships found in the Thames at Blackfriars and in the harbor of St. Peter Port on Guernsey were little different from the ships of the Veneti, a Breton tribe who had confronted Caesar more than three centuries earlier. Though the government had changed, the Atlantic seamen and their ships were the direct inheritors of a seafaring tradition now 6000 years old. The collapse of the Roman Empire in the 5th century did little to disrupt the Atlantic sea-ways. Mediterranean pottery, possibly trans-shipped in Iberia, was reaching western Britain in the 6th century, and by the 8th century it is clear from the distribution of French pottery in Cornwall, Wales, Ireland, and western Scotland that maritime traffic was brisk. In the 9th and 10th centuries these same routes were used by Norse mariners in their many expeditions to raid, to settle, and to trade.\n\nThe emergence of the western European states as a powerful counterweight to the maritime empires of the Italian cities of Genoa and Venice was, to a large extent, based on the strength of this maritime tradition. The sturdy cogs and sharp caravels able to sail close to the wind were brilliantly adapted to the demands of the Atlantic and infinitely more efficient than the lumbering, overmanned Venetian galleys. And so, when the moment was right and a new confidence prevailed, it was the ships and the sailors of the Atlantic facadeSpain and Portugal and later France, Britain, and the Netherlandsthat were to face the ocean and to conquer it. The fury of the Atlantic had honed the skills of their ancestors over hundreds of generations, and now they were its masters. No longer was the Atlantic facade the edge of the world. It had become the center.\n\nBarry Cunliffe is professor of European archaeology at the Institute of Archaeology, University of Oxford (Fellow of Keble College).

Thomas\n\nIn his Sather Lectures of 1984-85, Anthony Snodgrass argued that archaeology be recognized as more than the handmaid of historywhile it does illustrate or confirm events known through written sources, its evidence and inferences have an independent scope and value. Archaeology has special significance for periods from which little or no written evidence exists. The Greek Age of Heroes is a convincing case in point.\n\nWhen Heinrich Schliemann set out to demonstrate the historical reality of the Greek heroic age by digging at a site he judged to be Troy, he was greeted by at least as much skepticism as good willand probably more. In response to his claim that he had uncovered the site of the Trojan War, the popular German magazine Kladderadatsch published a satirical telegram from Troy. It expanded on Schliemanns own reports by announcing the discovery of Achilles grave identified by the ankle bone which, naturally, would reveal the point of Achilles vulnerability. The rest of the body was missing. The notice concluded, Achilles stuck in pocket. All well. Schliemann. More serious criticism came from contemporary archaeologists like W. J. Stillman who stated in the London Times (January 9, 1889): I hope before long to put all the evidence . . . in such a shape that no one can doubt reasonable that Troy is the Troy of Croesus [i.e. the 6th century B.C.] and Tiryns a Byzantine palace of about 1000 A.D. That is, the dating would be at least 600 yearsand perhaps more than 2000later than the Bronze Age.\n\nThere were so few known sites, let alone events, to confirm the accuracy of these particular finds that no consensus had emerged by the time of Schliemanns death in 1891. Walter Leafs obituary notice indicated one reason: Dr. Schliemann was essentially epoch-making in his branch of study, and it is not for epoch-making men to see the rounding off and completion of their task.[1] Indeed, Schliemann was a pioneer in a discipline that has only come of age in the last half century.\n\nAnother factor was at work in the criticism of Schliemanns efforts: many scholars refused to find anything historical in the Age of Heroes. In 1938, nearly half a century after Schliemanns death, the classical scholar S. E. Bassett could still declare in the Sather Lectures at Berkeley that [t]he fabulous age of Greece must have no place in history. [Homer] created a life that never was on land or sea.[2] By contrast, authors can now state boldly, as J. T. Hooker did in his Mycenaean Greece: I propose . . . to discuss, from a historical point of view, some of the crucial periods in the development of Aegean lands during the Bronze Age.[3] His principal focus was on Mycenaean culture from ca. 1600 to 1200 B.C. Within these four centuries, major phases, events, and developments were dated with a fair degree of precision.\n\nHow did myth become history so suddenly? An early step forward occurred with the expansion of evidence. An early step forward occurred with the expansion of evidence. As at Troy, heroic tales suggested certain sites where Bronze Age remains might be discovered. Thus, to prove the reality of the Trojan War, Schliemann needed not only a site for the war but also another for the home of the Greek leader of that campaign, Agamemnon. He excavated successfully at Hissarlik (now generally acknowledged to be the location of Troy) and Mycenae, which every reader of the Iliad knew as the home of Agamemnon. However, two sites whose dating was initially unclear do not constitute a broadly based or chronologically fixed culture. Evidence from more locations was essential, and the island of Crete presented new data in abundance in the early years of the 20th century. Sir Arthur Evanss excavation of the palace of the (mythical) labyrinth of the (mythical) Minos at Knossos was followed by a brace of similar discoveries on the island. Work on the mainland, too, increasingly added dots to the map of early Greece.\n\nPalaces, grand burial sites, and precious objects are welcome to archaeologists, but another form of archaeology has, in the past three decades, added considerably to our knowledge of the Age of Heroes. Survey archaeology refocuses attention from major centers to the domain of ordinary people with the goal of understanding the relationship between the land and its use. The lens is wide: one of the first major survey projects, the Minnesota Messenia Expedition, studied the habitation pattern in a region of 1,400 square miles in the southwestern Peloponnese for all periods from the Neolithic age to the Roman era. Thus it produced a composite picture of environmental, social, and economic developments of all levels of the regions population over an extensive period. The relationship between the whole region and its palace center is now much clearer, as it is for other parts of Greece. For instance, a thorough investigation of the road system reaching out from Mycenae reveals that the main roads extended only about four kilometers from the citadel. The earlier notion that the residents of the citadels held sweeping, absolute power must be modified to accommodate sectors in the nearby countryside that were independent of the centers. In other words, it is now possible to examine the political, economic, and social organization of the Age of Heroes (and non-heroes).\n\nBecause the scope of survey archaeology is so broad, it requires a variety of specialists. The team organized for the Messenia project included specialists in ethnology, epigraphy, metallurgy, civil engineering, geology, history, geography, ceramic technology, soils, agricultural economics, and palynology (analysis of pollen and spores), along with archaeologists and para-archaeological personnel. Such cooperation, valuable in itself, is symptomatic of yet another new direction in archaeology, namely the integration of new technologies which began about the middle of the 20th century. The current tool kit of archaeologists includes magnetometers which reveal features beneath the earths surface and objects buried in the seafloor; robots for investigating caves inaccessible to humans; tools of aerial reconnaissance; and, of course, computers. Dates can be learned through many techniques from radio carbon and dendrochronology to analysis of charged atoms. Pots are now tested to reveal the composition of their clay. The list of new tools is impressiveoverwhelmingly so to non-scientists. And it has made an impression on the discipline of archaeology, for suddenly archaeologists have been presented with not only more data but data of another order. The tools give access to evidence previously unattainable, while the information allows more precise conclusions on such important subjects as dating and the origin of materials and thus patterns of exchange both within the Aegean and beyond.\n\nLooking beyond Greece has also enhanced our knowledge of Bronze Age Greece. In the early days of archaeology, the study of single sites or regional cultures was sufficiently arduous work. However, that focus produced isolated snapshots, not a broad panorama. The wider perspective of the last three decades or so has set new questions and even provided some reasonable answers. For example, the prevailing consensus until recently was that the Aegean palace systems were somewhat reduced copies of Near Eastern and Egyptian organizations. More careful comparison combined with mounting evidence from Greeceespecially the information made available through the decipherment of Linear B in the 1950shas collapsed the earlier consensus. One recent study proposes that a more apt comparison is with the Hallstatt hill forts in the northern Alps and the warrior aristocracy for whom they were built.[4] Or consider the shift in our understanding of the sudden collapse of the Mycenaean civilization beginning at the end of the 13th century. It was once easily explained by recourse to warlike invaders entering Greece from the north. With the realization that virtually all Bronze Age civilizations of the eastern Mediterranean experienced similar, contemporary difficulties, scholars began to pursue a more inclusive investigation. Did those invaders deal first with Greece, then make their way through Anatolia, the Levant, and into Egypt? Greater precision in dating ruled out this answer. Perhaps a variety of invaders burst upon the scene at the same time. Possible, but an explanation grounded in the larger context is sounder. Evidence from the eastern Mediterranean civilizations shows that the second half of the second millennium witnessed an intense marine-based internationalism which was not only mercantile but also diplomatic, militaristic, and intellectual in nature. Consequently, problems within that interlocking network most certainly are at least part of the explanation.\n\nThe broader view has lengthened chronological horizons. The roots of the Mycenaean civilization were planted five millennia earlier in the first agricultural villages. And in spite of the devastations of the 13th and 12th centuriescausing a population decline of 90%life continued in tiny, isolated hamlets, some of which have now been found and explored. The four centuries from 1150 to 750 B.C. saw the transformation of the Mycenaean heritage by survivors hanging on to life in tightly knit communities that would blossom into polis-communities in the late 8th and 7th centuries. This longer view reveals a fuller history of life in Greece. Classical Greece has long belonged to the proper domain of historians; now we can investigate the roots of that civilization.\n\nIn addition to employing new tools, archaeologists have begun to look at physical objects in different ways. Object biography is one of the most exciting of these recent perspectives. Its basic premise is that objects, like people, are transformed over time, not simply in physical ways but also in their uses and value. A clay pot, for example, made for a particular function can become a gift to a friend, valued more for its connection than its function. So great may its value become that it later serves as a prize in a competition. Finally, on the death of the victor of that competition, the pot is perhaps buried with him as a mark of his honor.\n\nApplying this perspective to early Greece, Susan Langdon tracked two unusual pots dated to the 8th century.[5] One, from Argos, had been used for a burial and, when excavated, contained bones of a woman. Modern scientific dating revealed that her age at burial was about thirty-five. The pot was not made for this burial; it dates twenty years earlier. Langdon recreates the story of the vessel and its owner over the years of their association by placing both in the context of their world. The pot was made when the woman was in her early teens, that is, at the stage of preparing for marriage. The shape and appearance of the pot suggest that it held worked wool of woven textiles; in other words, it was likely to have played a part in the preparation of dowry goods. Scenes on the densely painted surface show figures of men with horses, men wrestling, and women dancing, all known from other evidence to figure in bridal contests. And both the pot and the burial indicate the high family status that would warrant such a contest. At age thirty-five, the woman would belong to the older generation possessed of wisdom as well as status. We should remember that Penelope, after the twenty-year absence of Odysseus and now mother of an adult son, would have been about the same age at the time of her husbands return. Astute, nobly born, married, and, yes, still lovely, she was courted by many suitors who believed Odysseus to be dead. An Argive vase can locate Penelopes within the culture of their own non-literate time.\n\nBy combining the fruits of research in several fields, we can insert people and their activities into the story of the Heroic Age of Greece. For instance, the developments in archaeology presented above cast new light on the tale of Jason and his Argonauts. More than a myth, the tale reflects certain realities of the Mycenaean Age which have been demonstrated to have historical authenticity. Archaeologists have identified a place known as Iolkosnear modern Voloswith Mycenaean remains. Comparison with other sites suggests that it was the northernmost citadel-centered kingdom in late Bronze Age Greece, a society structured around roughly a dozen major centers. Investigation as recently as the summer of 2000 has produced even more indications of the ancient vitality of the area around Iolkos in the finds at neighboring Dimini. Knowledge of the topography demonstrates that the land in the region was valuable for agricultural production and animal husbandry. It overlooks a bay with a good harbor, still important today. Through archaeological evidence we can narrow the time-frame for the flourishing Mycenaean site to approximately 300 years ca. 15001200 B.C. It is true that Thessaly continued to be prominent in the Classical and Hellenistic periods, but in the Classical period Iolkos itself was unimportant. Moreover, a tie between the Argonautica and Iolkos nicely suits the thesis proposed seventy years ago by Martin P. Nilsson that myth cycles are linked to major Mycenaean sites.[6]\n\nJason and his adventures were known to bards of the late Dark Age: the Argo was widely-sung according to Homer. That the oral tradition of the bards reaches back to Mycenaean times is indicated by linguistic similarities between the Greek of Linear B and that of the Homeric poems. What is more, it is the nature of oral tradition in a culture without literacy to be conservative; it is the means, by poetic language, of preserving and passing on important information from one generation to the next. Being poetic, the language may bear closer resemblance to myth or legend or folktale than to history, blurring distinctions between those categories. The decipherment of the Linear B script half a century ago offers evidence from names. A number of the Argos crew, in the accounts that have been preserved, bear names akin to heroes whose feats were earlier than those of the Trojan War. Names that end in -eus belong to the pre-Trojan era, and such names are frequent among the Argonauts. The name Jason itself may appear in the form of I-wa-so on a tablet from Pylos.\n\nThe larger context of life in the Bronze Age is another clue. By the late Bronze Age, relatively simple mechanisms of trade had swollen into international ventures throughout the regions of the eastern Mediterranean, and the Aegean cultures were active participants;Mycenaean activity escalated from 1500 B.C. Accumulating artifactual evidence shows that the mainland activity extended beyond the Aegean into the Sea of Marmora and even into the Black Sea. Mycenaean swords have been discovered in modern Georgia, the region in which Jasons destination, Colchis, was located, and the Linear B word Ko-ki-da can be read as Colchis.\n\nMycenaean goods may have been carried in the ships of other peoples. On the other hand, nautical evidence suggests that the kind of ship necessary to move through the treacherous waters of the Bosporus was at hand in the second millennium in the essential form of the Greek penteconter. Further, re-creation of navigational skills in a galley constructed in accord with Bronze Age technology demonstrated that wind and the strength of twenty oarsmen could carry this 1980s Argo from present-day Volos to the eastern end of the Black Sea.\n\nFinally, dating of the varied evidence by more precise means tends to converge on an earlier part of the Mycenaean Age. Iolkos was an important site during the late Bronze Age, with two successive large buildings. Troy VI, perhaps the port of call for eastward travel by sea, flourished from ca. 1700 to 125030 B.C. Mycenaean finds in the Black Sea include several from the earlier part of the period. The Argonauts names reflect a generation earlier than those of the Trojan War heroes. Schliemann is said to have exclaimed I have looked on the face of Agamemnon when he excavated the shaft graves at Mycenae. He was wrong. With the precision of modern dating techniques we know that the bones he found there date to ca. 1600, while the destruction at Troy associated with the Trojan War must belong to the 13th century B.C. Even today, human bones cannot name themselves without clear, accompanying written evidence, and not always even with that evidence. Yet the picture of the human past that archaeology now provides is remarkable for the depth, breadth, and exactitude it can impute.\n\nTroy neatly exemplifies the transformation. When Schliemann hoped to find concrete proof of a Trojan War, archaeology lacked a rigorous method and possessed few tools beyond shovels and strong arms. Objects uncovered through excavation could be classified by types, but absolute dating was seldom possible. Because Troy was one of the first heroic sites to be explored, comparative study was not possible. And there was no written evidence beyond Homer. Thus, by definition, the period lay outside the realm of history. Now, archaeology has come of age; in fact, it has passed through several phases in advancing to its present maturity. Accumulation of an enlarged data base marked one of those phases. Troy can be viewed together with a great many sites in the Aegean, Anatolian, and Mediterranean spheres. The clay tablets found at citadel centers have proven to be written records that scholars can now read. Another phase brought scientific tools and new approaches to the discipline. As a result, the levels of Troy can be dated with a high degree of accuracy, and these dates, in turn, can be compared with those of, say, Mycenae.\n\nFor a time, a search for scientific laws led archaeologists to privilege theory and models at the expense of the putative object of their investigations, namely, human life in the past. Complaints against this trend have become more numerous in the past decade or so: enough of processes, many are urging; let us put people back in the picture. It is unlikely that we will ever be able to describe the last days of Hektor or Achilles. Yet it is entirely possible to understand the kind of fighting that occurred at places like Troy in the late Bronze Age. Recovery of the treasures found by Schliemann more than a century ago which had been lost during World War II has made it possible to show that Troy was an important emporium in a trade network by the mid-3rd millennium, a status that continued through most of the 2nd millennium. And, with the discovery during the past decade that Troys citadel was surrounded by a densely built lower city with a population of 5,000 to 10,000, its importance to contemporariessay, those living in Bronze Age Greek citadelsis evident. Myth has become history.\n\nCarol G. Thomas is professor of history at the University of Washington. Her most recent book is Citadel to City-State: The Transformation of Greece, 1200700 B.C.E.

That memory came rushing back years later as I read an account of some Africans reactions to the first European visitor to the Senegal River in 1455: some . . . rubbed me with their spittle to discover whether my whiteness was dye or flesh. A Ugandan colleague who studied in Switzerland tells the story of a bold little girl in that country who performed the same experiment on him and reported to her schoolmates that he was black but not sooty.\n\nHistory is a dialogue between the present and the past, as well as an exercise in cross-cultural understanding. What we bring to the inquiry influences what we discover, and what we discover may reshape our understanding of our own time and place. Sometimes, as in the case of the wet-finger test, we find a common humanity that transcends time and culture, but often it is a struggle to bridge the gap between our expectations and the historical evidence we uncover.\n\nMy decision to become a historian of Africa was very much a product of my own life and times. I had gone to newly-independent Nigeria as a Peace Corps volunteer and my many fascinating experiences there moved me to study it when I returned. I was not alone. The field of African history itself had arisen in tandem with the independence movements in African colonies in the late 1950s and early 1960s and in sympathy with their aspirations. Like other Africanists of my generation, I wanted to discover the real Africa that lay beyond older narratives focus on European explorers, merchants, missionaries, and empire builders. The term Afrocentric didnt yet exist, but it describes our interest in bringing to light the historic antecedents of the proud African achievers of the present. Our enthusiasm may have led to exaggerations, but our desire to dislodge old paradigms forced us to base our studies on solid research and to pursue the implications of Africa-centered history to new levels. Despite blind spots and biases, recent scholars have made solid advances in understanding the African past.\n\nThe new African history has influenced scholars reexamining Atlantic history and added the names of African states and rulers to the textbooks, but it has also had to contend with other revisions of African history coming from historians of Europe and the Americas. Especially in versions intended for popular audiences, these accounts sometimes seemed to turn the old Eurocentric narrative of Africa on its head. In place of European heroes saving Africa, a new generation of anti-colonial historians presented European villains bringing exploitation, underdevelopment, conquest, and cultural imperialism. Even though their new narratives were a much needed corrective, their Eurocentrism tended to relegate Africans to being largely silent, generally hapless victims of the all-powerful Western world.\n\nWas it possible to construct a more balanced narrative? I struggled with these issues while reexamining the encounters between Africans and Europeans during the four centuries before the imperial conquests of the late 19th century. A better narrative needed to use the new Africanist scholarship to show how Africans understood and shaped these encounters. To make African perspectives vital and valid, I combed the records for historical voices that might be included. As Africas Discovery of Europe, 1450-1850 moved toward completion, these voices from the past reshaped the narrative in unexpected ways.\n\nFor one thing, there proved to be a lot of African voices. One effect of the encounter with Europe was that many Africans learned European languages well enough to voice opinions that were recorded by Europeans, and some Africans wrote down their own views. Though it was not in my initial plan, the longest chapter in the book came to be about the many Africans in 18th- and early 19th-century Europe. But the most significant impact of these African voices was to broaden and deepen the exploration of many topics. African voices took the narrative to places that authorial caution, discretion, and concern for the sensibilities of readers and reviewers might have feared to go on its own. Among these were religion, slavery, and racism, often blended in intriguing ways.\n\nFor example, a letter from King Afonso I of the kingdom of Kongo to the king of Portugal in 1526 is commonly quoted for its chilling description of the destructive effects of the slave trade. But Afonsos request that his kingdoms trade with Portugal be restricted to no more than some priests and a few people to teach in the schools, and no other goods except wine and flour for the holy sacrament is less often noted, for our skeptical and secular age resists the clear implication that contacts with Europe included some Africans sincere acceptance of Christianity. Nor is it commonly acknowledged that King Afonsos opposition to the slave trade centered on the fact that he has unable to stop many of his subordinate chiefs from selling fellow Kongolese in their desire to obtain the goods the Portuguese merchants brought. However, when Afonso himself had a great many captives from foreign wars to sell in 1540, his opposition to the slave trade vanished. He wrote that no ruler in Atlantic Africa esteems the Portuguese goods so much . . . as we do. We favor their trade, sustain it, open markets [for it]. How widely Afonso deserves to be cited as a spokesman for Africans may justly be debated, but one can hardly defend citing him so selectively that it distorts his views.\n\nThough few wrote it down in so many words, other African rulers were as eager as Afonso for the goods the Atlantic trade brought, and many were more adept than he in reaping the profits of the trade from their equally eager European counterparts. For example, the royal merchants of the kingdom of Benin in 1724 rebuffed Dutch traders who had tried to convince them to pay higher prices for the goods they imported because costs had risen in Europe. The Benin officials asserted that the price in Europe does not concern them and insisted that valuations agreed upon in earlier years continue in force. Unable to make a profit, the Dutch eventually withdrew from Benin, but English traders eagerly took their place. One can argue that Europeans command of the seas and colonial America gave them the upper hand in the Atlantic economy, but on the African coast they not only had to respect Africans perceptions of prices; at Benin as elsewhere in West Africa, every European ship captain who came to trade also had to pay African officials hefty customs charges and fees and bestow rich gifts on local African officials. The European trading forts on the Gold Coast owed local rulers annual ground rents.\n\nThe fact that some coastal Africans participated willingly in the sale of slaves does not alter the injustice to those enslaved, but what should we make of African voices from that era who argued in favor of slavery? Jacob Capitein from the Gold Coast wrote his thesis on the theology of slavery at the University of Leiden in 1742. One of two 18th-century Africans to earn an advanced academic degree in Europe, he argued in elegant Latin that slavery was fully compatible with Christian theology and was often the means through which Africans became Christians. Though his case was based on European sources, Capiteins defense of slavery would not have seemed odd to many of his countrymen on the Gold Coast. In 1820, for example, King Osie Bonsu of the powerful state of Asante pressed a representative of the British government to explain why his people had turned against the slave trade, asking if they think it bad now, why did they think it good before? Is not your [Christian] law an old law, the same as the [Islamic] law? He denied the slave trade was bad for his kingdom, or that it increased the frequency of war. Rather, he argued, he made war for honorable reasons and the gold and prisoners he took were his to keep or sell.\n\nCapiteins thesis contains a second argument that, on first reading, seems even more surprising. Far from trying to curry favor with his hosts, Capitein was concerned that his thesis would upset his Dutch readers. He writes, It is clear beyond doubt that most Netherlanders [believe] that Christian freedom cannot walk in step with slavery.[1] Although the enslavement of Africans had rich and powerful supporters in Europe, Capiteins words are a reminder that slavery had been banned in northern Europe for centuries and was unlikely to have much support among those not dependent on its profits. Before long the abolitionist movement would begin to tap popular anti-slavery sentiments, and some Africans were part of that movement in Europe. Fortyfive years after Capitein issued his thesis, a dozen sons of Africa in Britain with a different view of Christian morality wrote a letter praising the British abolitionist Granville Sharp for his long, valuable, and indefatigable labours . . . to rescue our suffering brethren in slavery and to curb the vicious violators of Gods holy law.[2]\n\nIf African Christians could hold quite different positions on the morality of slavery, the presence of free, literate Africanseven advanced students and professorsin 18thcentury Europe brings into question the common assumption that racial prejudices there were monolithic. Ignatius Sancho, one of the most notable of these African intellectuals, was well aware of the range of treatment an African might experience at European hands. Sancho was born on a slave ship in 1729 and lost his mother in infancy in Colombia. Yet when, in 1766, he wrote to the English novelist Lawrence Sterne that the early part of my life was rather unlucky, he was referring not to these hardships, but to the lack of intellectually stimulating books. He had been brought to England at the age of two, where his own wit and good luck in time gained him employment and patronage from the Montagues, who had his portrait painted by Thomas Gainsborough. When he died in 1780, he was the first son of Africa to have an obituary in an English newspaper and the only one whose life was recorded in the Dictionary of National Biography. Sanchos fame was due less to his patrons, whose employment he left to become a humble shopkeeper, than to his literary achievements as a poet, playwright, musical theorist, and correspondent. His letters, published in two volumes after his death, are still in print.\n\nSanchos letters also attest to his awareness of the thin line that separated the social milieu where a black man of talent, manners, and morality might find honors and the one where racism reared its ugly head. He wrote to his fellow Afro-Briton, Julius Soubise, who had been raised as a gentleman by the Duchess of Queensbury, contrasting their fortunate place in good society with the miserable fate of almost all of our unfortunate colour in slavery and warning of the contempt and heart-racking abuse of the foolish vulgar Soubise would face if he persisted in a life of debauchery.[3] Sanchos words might imply that the line between good treatment and bad was based on class, but the life story of another West African, Ukawsaw Gronniosaw, who made a humble living in England and the Netherlands after escaping slavery in Barbados, is full of the kindness and acceptance he received from both the working poor and his middle-class benefactors. [4]\n\nSancho was exceptional in that his wife was of African stock, but the many free African men who resided in 18th-century Europe were more likely to find brides from among the majority population. Gronniosaw married a poor English weaver named Betty, while other Africans married European women from higher social strata. The fact that such unions were tolerated does not imply that racist opposition did not exist. A letter signed by Gustavus Vassa, the Ethiopian, printed in an English newspaper in 1788, was predicated on the notion that intermarriage was a prickly issue: If the mind of a black man conceives the passion of love for a fair female, [is] he . . . to pine, languish, and even die, sooner than an intermarriage be allowed[?][5] The author, better known as Olaudah Equiano, the name he used in his autobiography, wedded the Englishwoman Susanna Cullen a few years later without apparent incident. There is an interesting parallel between these marriages in Europe and those in coastal Africa in this era. Many European men resident there entered into long-term unions that seem as full of mutual love, mutual financial considerations, advantageous family ties, and beloved offspring as are common to the institution everywhere.\n\nThis brief overview can only hint at the value of looking at these early modern encounters through the eyes of contemporary Africans, even though the accounts that survive cannot be expected to represent the full range of experiences. Europeans and West Africans began their encounters with mutual curiosity about each other and an openness to the possibilities of continued relationships. African leaders were as capable as European ones of assessing what they might gain and were as eager to do so. To note that quite a number of coastal Africans found opportunities in the Atlantic trade for new wealth and power does not diminish the calamity of millions of other Africans being robbed of their freedom. Some Africans were also open to the cultural options made available by these encounters, including Christianity, literacy, and occasionally literary distinction in European languages. Appreciating the full range of the encounters enhances understanding not just of those pre-colonial centuries but also of the commercial and cultural exchanges that have continued long after the slave trade ended. If Africans are to appear on the stage of history as full human beings, then they must strut the boards as powerful partners as well as victims, as open to the opportunities the Atlantic brought as they were capable of suffering under its inequities.\n\nDavid Northrup is professor of history at Boston College and president-elect of the World History Association.

Nabokov, a professor of American Indian studies and world arts and cultures at UCLA, has drawn on decades of his own research and recent findings in ethnohistory, anthropology, folklore, and Indian studies to write A Forest of Time: American Indian Ways of History (Cambridge University Press, 2000). The result is an impressive work of transdisciplinary scholarship. His exploration of the complex and varied ways that American Indian societies make sense of the past opens up the subject of American Indian historical imagination to the general reader. In the process, Nabokov raises a number of important questions, especially regarding the ways historians approach the history of non-Western peoples. Readers of Historically Speaking may well find some of his claims challenging, perhaps even problematic, but there can be little doubt that Nabokov has focused attention on matters that prompt historians to reflect on the nature, practice, and limitations of historical inquiry.\n\nTo provide readers of Historically Speaking with an opportunity to encounter Nabokovs provocative work and evaluate it on their own, we have secured permission from Cambridge University Press to excerpt the concluding pages of A Forest of Time. Following the excerpt, we provide an interview with Nabokov, that Donald Yerxa conducted on May 9, 2002.\n\nAn Excerpt from A Forest in Time by Peter Nabokov\n\nCasting a final glance over these chapters, let me highlight a few ideas and themes that have threaded through them.\n\nFirst, like the original Cambridge essay that launched it, this lengthier prolegomenon to American Indian ways of history has joined with the late historian H. Stuart Hughess vision of history, which stresses the central importance of symbols in establishing common values of a given culture . . . . The symbol conveys the implicit principles by which the society lives, the shared understanding of assumptions which require no formal proof (History as Art and as Science: Twin Vistas of the Past [University of Chicago Press, 1975], 80).\n\nThe different Indian senses of the past that stand as separate trees with their respective branches in this American Indian forest are not assemblages of existential happenings that lack organic connection. Usually structured in ways that may reflect different combinations of socio-economic, political, religious, and hence historical determinants, they all stress selected cultural meanings, common aspirations, and preferable social processes through the media of well-worn multivocal condensed symbols that have swelled in content and stood the test of time. Such symbols and the ritualistic actions they empower serve to naturalize history, to retrospectively reify the contingent so that, for instance, ethnic communities come to accept their origins, commemorations, and destinies as foreordained by higher powers.\n\nSecond, in the articulation of any Native societys historical consciousness, we must also remember that these master symbols and root metaphors have almost certainly undergone transformations, the plasticity of which Hughes also speaks in his book and whose inventive presence has been evinced throughout this work. Within these Native philosophies of history, moreover, high value is usually placed upon the maintenance of Indian conceptual autonomy over time, in as outwardly consistent and inwardly reassuring a fashion as possible. Sometimes this requires adjusting the facts and calls for retroactive enhancement in order for history to make sense in Indian terms, to integrate older claims into new sociopolitical climates, and to pass on essential meanings distilled from collective experience.\n\nSuspecting that labels such as tradition or sacred are employed as a flag of convenience to legitimate a position held on other grounds (Jan Vansima, On History and Tradition, in Paths in the Rainforests: Towards a History of Political Tradition in Equatorial Africa [University of Wisconsin Press, 1990], 258), or to exempt subject matter from empirical scrutiny, should not make us turn our backs on either the persistence of certain social phenomena or the inherently dynamic nature of culture itself. Uncovering the synthesized nature of indigenous claims does not mean that they are composed of thin air. Study of their components and adhesive compounds identifies cultural processes that can also be upstreamed to identify their presence and consistency over earlier eras. True, a few traditions may be unmasked as individually perpetrated frauds, public relations strategies, or examples of collective self-delusion. But the fact remains that history is not given and tradition is not static, as James Collins puts it, and modulations or recombination of traditions do not make tribal agency and social identity unreal or fictive, as terms such as constructed or invented can imply, but [they do] make them profoundly historical (Understanding Tolowa Histories: Western Hegemonies and Native American Responses [Routledge, 1998], 5051). The trick lies in simultaneously tracking down hard facts and their cultural and historical contexts and nuances, without which they dont mean much.\n\nThird, former times may be considered foreign countries by non-Indian historians, but to Native peoples they usually constitute familiar, contiguous, and ever-present terrain, whose deceased occupants may even put in their two cents worth. Despite my aversion to simplistic dichotomies, a pervasive distinction between Indian and non-Indian forms of history is the one between their presentist and pastist orientations, respectively. Sometimes the Native stories of earlier times swing between neighborhood gossip and lofty vision in order to personalize the past, to bring it in tune with inherited world views, or to warn about moral consequences so as to have maximum impact on the history of the future. For Indian history is about nothing if not cultural survival, employing what the writer Gerald Vizenor likes to call the uniquely Indian skills of trickster survivance.\n\nWhile unusual permissions to make history may seem extended in American Indian practices for conceptualizing and representing the past, that does not necessarily mean that the academic sense of historical accuracy [or chronology], as we have seen, is altogether jettisoned in the process. Indians have coexisted in many conceptual domains; their historical traditions have rarely seen any incompatibilities between the world of facts and that of dreams. Generally, what remains of utmost importance to Indian historians has been psychological persistence, social congruence, group self-esteem, spiritual independence, cultural distinctiveness, and perpetuation of core valuesin short, the continuing Native American acculturation of time and space. For outsiders who complain that this is not playing fair, Indians might well ask to be shown the historicityoften bearing catch phrases such as Iron, Bronze, Silver, or Gold Ages, force majeure, Third Reich, the divine right of kings, manifest destiny, Frontier Thesis, the Monroe Doctrine, or a fledgling presidents first Hundred Days which is not underwritten by similar vested interests and cultural claims. One could even argue that the transparent didacticism of Indian narratives and histories simply makes them more up front about it.\n\nFourth, the study of Indian-white relations from a Native perspective reveals it less as separate and inviolate entities striking sparks off each other than as an essentially relational field of interacting and cross-borrowing cultural identitiesoften within contexts, to be sure, of unequal power relations, racial prejudice, gross injustice, and cross-cultural misreadings. Even so, todays tillers in historical fields must consider their work equally relational. Bestcase scenario: they must invite Indians as full partners into their investigations.\n\nWhen they do so, as ethnohistorian Ernest S. Burch, Jr. discovered, they can tap into fresh historical wells. Upon interviewing Inupiaq people in northwestern Alaska, for example, Burch uncovered a technology for wholesale intertribal warfare and the existence of early 19th-century battles that refuted everything hed learned from Arctic scholars. The really upsetting thing about this, he writes, is that if I had been willing from the beginning to pay attention to what elders were telling me, I would have known all of this ten or twenty years sooner. As it was, I missed an entire generation of people who probably knew more than my own informants did (From Skeptic to Believer: The Making of an Oral Historian, Alaska History [Spring 1991]: 11). Updating this sense of urgency, Vine Deloria, Jr. asks historians to look into the controversies of this century and record from those people still living their recollections of incidents of a half century ago. Rather than attempting to rebuild the memories of the Pueblos regarding Coronado and the revolt of 1688, people should right now be doing extensive writing and interviews of the elder Pueblo people concerning how they organized and eventually won their lands in 1924 (The Twentieth Century, in Daniel Tyler, ed., Red Men and Hat-Wearers: Viewpoints in Indian History [Pruett Publishing Co., 1976], 163).\n\nAnd even if academic historians remain disinclined to conduct fieldwork, for their works on Indian-white relations to be anything but culturally cosmetic they must apprentice themselves to the sorts of social, symbolic, economic, political, and folkloristic data that are the meat and potatoes of anthropology. Only an anthropologist familiar with Indian culture and social process, argue Mildred M. Wedel and Raymond J. DeMallie, can discern the clouded facts, correctly analyze the misleading commentary, or extract significant cultural information that appears incidentally in documents written for quite different purposes (The Ethnohistorical Approach in Plains Area Studies, in W. Raymond Wood and Margot Liberty, eds., Anthropology on the Great Plains [University of Nebraska Press, 1980], 110). And, If nothing else, adds Donald B. Smith, from a good ethnological monograph, one can obtain a feel for a native group, and an idea of what white society looks like, viewed within a native community (Le Sauvage: The Native People in Quebec, Historical Writing on the Heroic Period of New France [National Museums of Canada, 1974], 91).\n\nFifth, this book represents one generalists dawning regard for the rich and scantily addressed history of American Indian intellectual life. It takes issue with the late Wilcomb E. Washburns implication of Native silence, impotence, ignorance, or compliance when he argues that Indian history is, for good or ill, shaped by the white presence. Whether physically in terms of European immigrants, or intellectually, in terms of Western historical and anthropological theories (Distinguishing History from Moral Philosophy and Public Advocacy, in Calvin Martin, ed., The American Indian and the Problem of History [Oxford University Press, 1987], 92). It takes seriously the proposition that, in their own ways, Indian communities and individuals have been thoughtfully preoccupied with their movements through time. It endorses efforts to transcend old characterizations of Indians as victims or stereotypes and their traditions as monolithic and intractable.\n\nThe many Indian pasts, I argue, are as much stories of philosophical, ideological, and symbolic creativity and synthesis, inevitably processed through definitions of self, community, and destiny, as they are beads of discrete incidents hung on narrative strings. No less than the contexts of assumption which exist through time in complex interrelation with each other that anthropologist George W. Stocking, Jr. holds up as a far more productive subject for non-Indian historians than determining their intellectual inheritance by citing an endless begetting of academic elders (what he terms the forerunner syndrome), a new breed of Indian historians must identify and investigate their own successive contexts of assumption, whose complexity may have intensified since first contact, literacy, and modernity, but that certainly possess their own developmental histories well before then. As I observed earlier, however, in this effort scholars of American Indian ancestry can find themselves in a bind. For a precondition of this academic approach is that one should accept the past on its own terms, while the presentist bias of the traditions they studyand possibly those they have personally inheritedis instead to formulate it as a collection of natural precedents for our times.\n\nSixth, and last, scholars, writers, and publishers should innovate new formats for representing on page or screen the multiple genres and mixed voices that are the warp and woof of Indian historicity and Indian-white relations. How to do conceptual, textual, illustrative, and typographic justice to the host of Indian ways of history that offer alternative, parallel, or altogether Other viewpoints can be a liberating challenge for future orchestators of historical representations, especially where multiple interest groups and their memories, interpretations, and aesthetics are concerned. To this end, I concur with Claude Levi- Strausss earlier comment that the homespun range of tribally produced histories may one day be seen as pioneers. These experiments exemplify the insistently incomplete and evolving nature of these materials, which conform with James Cliffords rhetorical questions concerning the processual nature of our subject:\n\nIs it possible that historical reality is not something independent of these differently centered perspectives, nor their sum total, and not the result of a critical sifting of different viewpoints by independent experts at the end of the day? Can we conceive of historical reality as an overlay of contextual stories whose ultimate meanings are open-ended because the contact relations that produced them are discrepant, unfinished? (Fort Ross Meditation in Routes: Travel and Translation in the Late Twentieth Century [Harvard University Press, 1997], 319).\n\nOn a few occasions, Ive used the verb bequeathed to characterize how traditionalist historians and others preoccupied with ensuring historical continuity often frame their responsibilities. Perhaps this analogy to material inheritance also has heuristic value in communicating the senses of property and duty that are often found in Indian notions of history. Conceiving of the past as a collective dowry, which subsequent generations must maintain in high repair and to which they must even contribute, as a sort of cultural capital from which they can draw ideological, spiritual, and psychological interest, may help us understand why Indian history must stay receptive to synthesis, accretion, and refurbishment.\n\nThis book proposes that devising ways to revisit the uniquely American Indian blends of spiritual, documentary, and opportunistic contemplations of the past offers American intellectual history a new frontier. When they are explored, as illustrated by Robert Allen Warriors pioneering comparison of the writings of John Joseph Matthews (Osage) and Vine Deloria, Jr. (Tribal Secrets: Recovering American Indian Intellectual Traditions [University of Minnesota Press, 1995]), Ruth J. Heflins comparative study of five generally contemporaneous Lakota writers (I Remain Alive: The Sioux Literary Renaissance [Syracuse University Press, 2000]), or more informally, as with Delorias memoir of lively brainstorming at the University of Arizona during Bob Thomass tenure (Bob Thomas as Colleague, in Steve Pavlik, ed., A Good Cherokee, a Good Anthropologist: Papers in Honor of Robert K. Thomas [American Indian Studies Center, 1998]), we find ourselves within subaltern American discourses. We feel freer to question whether we should ever be speaking of indigenous senses of the past as alternative histories or alternatives to history. Instead of cramming them into familiar paradigms, might we not temper the hegemony of Western historiography by interpreting it into them every now and then?\n\nWithout the opportunity for Indian peoples to tell their historical experiences in their many different ways, and without the burden upon non-Indian American historians to somehow weave Native ways of history into the research methodologies and narrative bedrock of their accounts, the fullness of the North American experience will remain unwitnessed and alternative visions for its future unrevealed. Just as there is nothing new about my books opening premise that historical practices are culture-specific, this broader challenge has also been expressed before. Historian Patricia Limerick followed up her insistence that her professional colleagues position cultural competition at the center of their narratives of the American West with her half-humorous proposal that America be dotted with Managed Contention Sites where multiple points of view and modes of interpretation might have at each other, thereby honoring the complexity of competing notions of truth and ways of getting at it (The Legacy of Conquest: The Unbroken Past of the American West [Norton, 1987], 27; The Battlefield of History, New York Times, 28 August 1997, A19).\n\nBut if we listen carefully, we hear Indians themselves calling for a historical discourse that doesnt quarantine their pasts and their intellectual life from the broader American experience and its modes of recollection. When an elder stood up in 1954 to tell the nations Commissioner of Indian Affairs that We have a hard trail ahead of us in trying to Americanize you and your white brothers. But we are not afraid of hard trails, he could have been talking about American Indian ways of history (Felix S. Cohen, Americanizing the White Man, The American Scholar [Spring 1952]: 178). When the Lakota author Luther Standing Bear wistfully imagined an alternative to his own indoctrination by the dominant societys educational system, he offered a prospectus we might well resurrect:\n\nSo we went to school to copy, to imitate; not to exchange language and ideas, and not to develop the best traits that had come out of uncountable experiences of hundreds of thousands of years living upon this continent. Our annals, all-happenings of human import, were stored in our song and dance rituals, our history differing in that it was not stored in books, but in the living memory. So, while the white people had much to teach us, we had much to teach them, and what a school could have been established upon that idea! (Land of the Spotted Eagle [University of Nebraska Press, 1933, 1978], 236).\n\nAn Interview with Peter Nabokov\n\nDonald Yerxa:What are you trying to accomplish with A Forest of Time?\n\nPeter Nabokov: Im trying to open up a subject that I feel has been neglected if not suppressed. On a most general level, A Forest of Time is about the multiple American Indian interpretations, selections, and uses of the past, depending on which community is telling the story and how it wants to make constructive use of it. After spending forty years studying American Indians, I want to pluralize and democratize notions, not only of what happened, but of how different native traditions transmit, interpret, and reinterpret what happened for their own purposes and devices. As a student of oral narratives and of symbolic actions, I am interested in how this all works. So if I look at a ritual, or if I examine the material culture which accompanies story telling or which are commemorations of things that happened in the past, or if I explore geography and what Indian people have to say about how that anchors the pastall of these are modes of historical representation. And I like to track those down and follow through on interpreting and contextualizing them.\n\nA Forest of Time is only an introduction. I would like to see other people go into detail as I did, for instance, in my dissertation on the Crow Indian Tobacco Society, in which I took one simple example of a ritual that a scholar some eighty years ago had said was very interesting and had recorded in minute detail. But he concluded that it didnt add up to much more than a collection of disparate elements from around the Plains. The sum was not greater than the parts in his view. So armed with readings that I had done as a graduate student, I went back to the Crow Indian reservation and began to ask questions, and also to look in the field notes of the very anthropologist I was trying to refute. And I found evidence everywhere to support my contention that this ritual was the way the Crow people had created their own identity as a separate group on the Plains, having broken off from another group, a farming people. The Crow Indians quickly became a hunting people, and in the attempt to create a new birth of themselves as a separate ethnicityand to perpetuate and renew that identitythey concocted a ritual out of old and new elements that was a coded reenactment of their version of their migratory origins. That was an eye-opener to me. Once their glossary of symbolic actions was decipherable, a whole story emerged. I would want my book to encourage others to go in deep that way. I would like academic historians to become a little more modest when they talk about histories that involve non- European peoples. But in all candor, I think that most of them will respond to these case studies and provocations by ignoring them.\n\nPart of this attitude has to do with the fact that Indian persistence remains a lump in the Anglo-American craw. These folks did not die out, which was the wishful thinking of the Vanishing Indian theme around the turn of the last century. They persist; they continue to endure; they continue to perpetuate separate histories; and they continue to run rings around the dominant society in the most intriguing ways while insisting on their diversity. Many non-Indians, I truly believe, sense this as a threat: its a threat territorially, and I think its a threat philosophically on some level. Its got to be a threat to a lot of basic tenets of modern American life, whether it be consumerism, American individualism, Christian fundamentalism, territorial integrity, or what have you. And the way Indians sometimes do this; the way they do their capitalism, which is kind of a collectivist free enterprise; the way they work at maintaining their families; the ways they overcome the consequences of forced assimilation, of territorial dispossession, of internalized racism, etc.are rather marvelous. In my view this astonishing persistence stands as something of a counterweight toand a moral comment onthe rest of America. And I suspect that some non- Indians can only take so much of that.\n\nYerxa: Could you explain your title?\n\nNabokov: When I was at the Newberry Library as a pre-doctoral fellow, I came across a quote from David Beaulieu, who was dissatisfied with the European model of history. He said the European approach to history may be likened to a tree with many branches; the trunk contains the common themes of Western history. Instead, Beaulieu suggested the image of a forest with many different and varied trees. Then I stumbled upon a number of quotes from different Indian peoples in which a botanical analogy was utilized to talk about diversity, whether it be diversity of myths within the tribe or diversity of notions of what temporality and the purposes of peoples movements through time were all about. Originally my sub-title was American Indian Concepts of History, but that suggested that Indians had intellectual traditions that were conceptualized along the same lines as those of Europeans. So remembering how Indians would describe in a gentle and non-judgmental form that we do it this way, and you do it that way, I opted for American Indian Ways of History.\n\nYerxa: As your title suggests, you stress that there is no singular Indian viewpoint regarding the past or history; nevertheless, you have had to structure a book around certain themes. So there are some commonalities to Indian ways of history. Would you speak to these?\n\nNabokov: There is always a tension in being true to the diversity that one is describing, and then creating chapter headings in the classic way that one organizes a book of this nature. When it came time to write A Forest of Time, I realized that I wanted to break up my treatment of the narrative material into the classic trio of legends, myths, and folktales. Now legends are usually the only genre that is considered to contain historical data, at least that is what folklorists, anthropologists, and even historians have said. But in my exposure to myths, and the literature about myths, I began to see that they were more plastic, malleable, and adjustable in terms of reflecting temporal change than I would have thought. So I devoted a chapter to discussing the ways myths reflect history. And I was also very impressed by a sparse but persuasive literature that talked about folktales as subversive commentaries on breaking events. While they seem to be entertaining stories about speaking animals, in point of fact some of them can be deciphered as editorials on the historical experiences that Indians were going through, and as ways by which they develop a kind of psychological strength and reinforcement, you might say, in the face of what was otherwise political and territorial powerlessness. I was excited about the folktales chapter; it is probably my favorite in the book.\n\nYerxa: Beyond the trio of legends, myths, and folktales, what are some of the other American Indian ways of knowing history?\n\nNabokov: Another theme is how American Indians anchored the past in place. There is material on Indian geographical sensibilities, and about special places that relate the nonbuilt environment to the past. Material culture provides another angle on Indian ways of history. I am also interested in the inter-relationship between the things that Indian peoples made and their role in their history, either as mnemonic or memory-triggering devices, or as things that had an almost iconic status. And fortunately, I was able to build on work I had done for a series of lectures, The Blood of Things, at Chicagos Newberry Library on this theme of material culture and history. Then there are those rituals; I emphasize the present tense because rituals remain a repository of historical knowledge and meaning. I had already written two books on this, including Indian Running, an account of Indians creating a kind of concocted ritual in 1980 that mixed symbolic elements of the past and the present. They reenacted a runner mission that in 1680 had enabled them to rise up against the Spanish in the Southwest, the most successful Indian uprising in American history. Beyond these ways of knowing history, I also wanted to deal with the troublesome issue of the impact of literacy on Indians and how Indians tried to turn writing to their own advantage, especially through the production of hybrid genres of documentary and legendary, multi-vocal prose. People today are much more receptive to literary experimentation in non-fiction, but I think Indians were attempting this early on because they had no choice if they did not want to submit completely to non-Indian notions of prose and what history is about, much of which is embedded in our notions of narrative. And then finally, I wanted to devote a chapter to the role of prophecy in Indian historical consciousness especially to its function of maintaining Indian conceptual control and autonomy over incomprehensible events and the happenstance of time.\n\nYerxa: You state that thinking about history, especially about the historical discourses of non-Western societies, is too important to be left to historians alone. Why is this the case, and how do you think historians have failed to understand the American Indian past?\n\nNabokov: Let me tackle the second part of the question first. I dont think historians have entirely failed to understand the American Indian past. People go with whats familiar. You only have so many hours in a day. Youre schooled in a particular approach. There are an awful lot of books to read. But reading becomes the primary method of acquiring information; the archives are considered the historians major primary resource. Theres little schooling in how to interpret the other primary resources Ive been talking about, such as material culture, unless a historian is willing to jump the fence and go learn from archaeologists. I think the balkanization of academia makes it difficult for historians to be multi-talented, in ritual and symbolic studies, for instance, which would mean they would have to learn something about anthropology, not just cosmeticallywhich was the case when anthropology became the rage among historians about fifteen or twenty years ago. In addition, you must know something about the land. I try to make an argument that you have to visit the placesnot only on weekends with your family pushing the stroller, but actually steep yourself in them. Then things will happen; you will learn things you will not otherwise know; answers will become apparent as to why people moved around and behaved in the ways they did. You have to be aware that history is a stream that everybody swims ineverybody. You have to realize that nobody is stupid when it comes to history and that there are all kinds of different historical voices and values. It seems to me that you have to develop a nose for the persistence of the past and the present in the oddest cornersin street signs, in place names, and in the changes of topography and plants and animals that are in a region. And I dont think that those skills are really taught. Environmental history, which fortunately the new Western historians have made a key element in their training, is a relatively recent academic frontier. Because of all this, I think it would be better for historians to open up a little bit to these other disciplinesto folklore, to the study of material culture, to history of religions, to cultural geography.\n\nYerxa: Are there particular historians whom you think do a good job examining the American Indian past?\n\nNabokov: With your permission Id rather trespass disciplinary boundaries and ask which scholarslets just say narratorsof what I also prefer to call American Indian culture history have inspired me. I dont want to trivialize this fairly eccentric list into some sort of Greatest Hits, so let me free-associate, and begin with what I still feel is one of the most powerful condensations of Indian-white relations ever put on paperthe twenty-nine-page personal narrative of a Cheyenne woman, Iron Teeth, transcribed by Thomas B. Marquis and included in his compilation, The Cheyennes of Montana (1978). Other remarkable pieces of precious historical-cultural testimony about or from Indian women include Sage Birchwaters interviews published as Chewid (1995) about the mysterious presence of a Chilcotin Indian woman in her early 20th-century western Canadian context, and Delphina Cuero (1991), Florence Shipeks edited life history of a longsuffering Southern California Indian woman. Those tributes paid, and looking at longitudinal studies from three North American regions, I would say that from Lewis Henry Morgans League of the Iroquois (1851) to Anthony F.C. Wallaces Death and Rebirth of the Seneca (1970), or from James Mooneys The Ghost Dance and the Sioux Outbreak of 1890 (1896) to Alexander Lessers The Pawnee Ghost Dance Hand Game (1933), Raymond J. Demallies The Sixth Grandfather (1984), and Michael Hittmans Wovoka and the Ghost Dance (1990), and from Albert S. Gatschets Migration Legend of the Creek Indians (1884) to Theda Perdues magnificent collection of southeastern Indian oral histories, Nations Remembered (1980), it is mostly historically- aware anthropologists who interest me, rather than a minority of culturally-oriented historians who I feel have produced the threedimensional, micro/macro histories, which in James Axtells words feature strong chronological narratives endowed with sensitive and sweeping analysis of cultural patterns and functions. Historian Theda Perdue is an exception, as is Frederick E. Hoxies Parading Through History: The Making of the Crow Nation in America, 18051935 (1995). Having spent nearly twenty years on an anthology of Indian-white relations as seen through Indian eyes, I also especially relish regional historical anthologies with multiple voices, like the Perdue collection I just cited, Gerald Vizenors little-known Escorts to White Earth, 1868 to 1968: 100 Year Reservation (1968), Malcolm Margolins collection on the California Indian experience, The Way We Lived (1993), and a host of lesserknown, often locally-published, often anonymous, idiosyncratic tribal histories authored by Indian communities which sometimes break new compositional ground in blending native and non-native modes of historicity. I shouldnt end before citing some personal favorites of Indian history: Joe Sandos Nee Hemish: A History of Jemez Pueblo (1987), Terry Glavins A Death Feast in Dimlahamid (1990), and Carolyn Gilman and Mary Jane Schneiders absolutely magnificent The Way to Independence: Memories of a Hidatsa Indian Family, 18401920 (1987).\n\nYerxa: You consider Western historical consciousness to be hegemonic, perhaps even a form of intellectual colonization of the past. Yet there are those, such as John Lukacs and V. S. Naipaul, who suggest that Western historical consciousness might well be seen as a gift to non-Western peoples giving them greater access to their own history. How do you respond to this notion?\n\nNabokov: Given the opportunity to learn, absorb, make positive use of, and monitor the meaningful integration of Western forms of history into their forms of history, Indian peoples definitely benefit from Western notions of history. What is so moving to me are the accounts of Indian people who worked with anthropologists and historians. These were often curious and intellectually gifted people in their own traditions, who once they encountered books and non-Indian ideas, were excited to document the histories of their own cultures. They spent countless hours, lived multiple lives, devoting themselves to the intellectual studysometimes in self-taught waysof their own peoples from what they thought was the Anglo-European perspective: to create archives, to record, to learn. And the unrequited nature of their contributions is heartbreaking. They suffered insults while they were on these lonely quests that generated a degree of suspicion and alienation within their own society. And they never achieved full acceptance in the non-Indian society. Not uncommonly, their works were published under other peoples names. So in a spontaneous response to your question, I would say that we do have a lot of examples of Indians trying to create new historical genres. But very little sympathy or attention has been given to those folks and those attempts. I also describe in A Forest of Time the predicament of American Indian intellectuals who are in the academic system and the difficulties they encounter with their peers as well as among their own people when they go home. Sportswriters have observed a similar problem that Indian athletes often experience when they try to participate in white mens sports. They are left trapped between worlds, between the value systems of private individual gain and collective scrutinized good. And these American Indian intellectuals would be the ones who would be accomplishing, under the best of all possible conditions, what you were describingthat is, converting the benefits of Western tradition for their own peoples. But Im not sure Indians want that. They are often looking for a third way, whether it be in literature, in the arts, or in the processes of pedagogical thinking and education. They are looking for a third way and, before casinos, without a lot of resources. And I really must add that one of those things that critics use to vilify Indians today is, of course, the fact that there are these garish casinos on the borders of so many Indian communities. But, ironically, those casinos are using the very greed that had dispossessed Indians against the people who had dispossessed them, in order to use those proceedsnot to buy Cadillacs or travel to Vegasbut to create old peoples homes, daycare centers, and tribal institutions of higher learning in which the kinds of hybrid experimentations in education Im referring to can take place.\n\nYerxa: One might conclude that Indian ways of knowing the past are contaminated or tamed by their contact with the universitytrained academics. And yet you mention in your chapter on material culture how archaeological work in Washington State unearthed a gill net fragment that corroborated the oral histories of the Makah people. Is this not a model for how multiple approaches to the pastboth Western and Indiancould work together constructively?\n\nNabokov: That is a wonderfully dramatic example, but it doesnt happen every day. It also seems to me that looking at practical ends as the raison detre for exploring Indian concepts focusing on history is treating Indians as less intellectually curious and less capable of having delight in the world than non-Indians. I think that on the level of ones spiritual and intellectual growth, as well as for excavating forgotten values regarding how to live conscientiously on the planet, the study of Indian culture and history has much to offer.\n\nYerxa: Are you optimistic that Indian ways of history can be woven into American academic life?\n\nNabokov: I have no idea.\n\nYerxa: Id like to press you a bit on the implications of advocating pluralism in historical thinking. Would this not open up, for example, providential ways of looking at the past utilizing sympathetic interpretations of Christian stories of healing, miracles, and that sort of thing? Respectful listening, I gather, must be granted to all peoples and traditions, and to the extent we do so, the past will become radically pluralized.\n\nNabokov: In the best of circumstances what I hope would happen with my book and its arguments is that some scholars will see the potential for their research projects to be enhanced and expanded and made more complex by looking at Indian perspectives on the past. And just maybe theyll try to get a grant to go to Georgia, lets say, and investigate the Indian side to their topics because some of their work overlaps the period of Indian preand post-removal from that area. Maybe these scholars might learn something of the consciousness of the Creek Indians of the 1800s from visiting Creeks today and talking with them about their views and listening to their folktalessomething which they might never have considered attempting otherwise. And I do endorse the sort of radical pluralization you describe, and relish your example of respecting and analyzing in good scholarly fashion stories of Christian miracles, say, from multiple perspectives,\n\nYerxa: Might a distinction between history and the past be useful in this discussion? History is the approach to the past developed in the West using an evidentiary methodology. It provides answers to a wide range of questions about the past, but history does not exhaust what can be said meaningfully about the past or how it can be approached.\n\nNabokov: Well said. There dont have to be lines drawn in the sand here, but of course such distinctions are useful, even critical, so long as they come under periodic review themselves. I only get aroused when people refuse to dignify other ways of looking at and thinking about the past, particularly when those ways are underlaid with an absolutely desperate concern to keep meanings in life, to salvage meanings that have stood the test of time, and to celebrate and remember. And when those are denied or trivialized, then I get irritated, not that my irritation means anything. But I begin to think, Wait a minute; after looking at American Indian stuff for forty years or more, there are some themes of repression and denial that are continuing here. I think that if history is offered to Indian kids who go to Stanford or here at UCLA in the more temperate, less arrogant, less privileged way in which youve just described it, they will be more eager to pore over the books, burn the midnight oil, and enhance the ways that its study can both expose the complexities of the past and enrich our own lives.\n\n<top>\n\nJoin the Historical Society and subscribe to Historically Speaking\n\nGlobalization and Its Critics\n\nby Jay R. Mandle\n\nTodays economic globalization means that no country is so remote that firms will be dissuaded from setting up production facilities in it because of location considerations alone. Advances in communications technology now allow corporations to make investment decisions with little attention accorded to distance as a limiting constraint. This, together with advances in education in poor countries, means that today modern production increasingly is undertaken in nations that previously were bypassed by the process of economic development.\n\nThe resulting change in the structure of global production is profound. In 1970, 3% of manufactured goods originated in developing countries. Twenty years later that share was 18%, and today it is even higher. The image of poor countries as confined to supplying agricultural goods or raw materials no longer corresponds to reality. With this shift has come an acceleration of economic growth. Between 1990 and 1998 economic growth in the thirteen largest poor countries averaged 7.3% per year, higher than in any prior corresponding periodrapid growth by any standard.\n\nThe United States, far more than any other country, has had a decisive voice in determining the content of the policies and procedures that have accompanied globalization. It has been and still is dominant in multilateral organizations such as the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund, and the United States was the most powerful influence in shaping the content of the rules that the World Trade Organization (WTO) today enforces. The position of the United States has been remarkably consistent over the years: remove controls over domestic markets as part of a process of minimizing the role of government in the economy, reduce barriers to imports, and welcome foreign investment. The transition from Republican administrations in the 1980s to Democratic ones in the 1990s produced no change in fundamentals, and the same is likely to be true of the administration of George W. Bush.\n\nThis policy orientation has been responsible for important successes. The acceleration in growth rates has occurred at least in part because policies to free foreign direct investment have assisted some countries in increasing their productive capacity more rapidly than if such flows were less available. And the liberalization of trade has advanced the interests of consumers throughout the world. Increased imports and exports have allowed for greater choice and lower prices.\n\nUnfortunately, this policy orientation has had its downside as well. This is particularly true with regard to international financial markets. The hypermobility of portfolio funds (the purchase of bonds, stocks and other financial instruments) has been the source of global economic instability. The Asian financial crisis of 1997-8 was only the most dramatic of a series of setbacks that has resulted in damaging, though temporary, economic reversals. Similarly, because the public sector has been reduced, governments have not provided adequate cushioning against the personal dislocations that globalization causes. Though economic globalization has generally raised income levels, it does not provide protection to those caught in and damaged by the whirlwind of change unleashed by the global economic restructuring it causes.\n\nIt is not too late to reform globalization to make it more just. Its institutions are still under construction, and it is therefore possible to reduce their one-sided emphasis on the mobility of products and capital. The rules and structures that govern the emerging international economic system remain embryonic and could be adjusted to ameliorate the costs inflicted on the innocent victims of economic progress. Globalization, like all market systems, requires extra-market systems of support and protection.\n\nWhat is needed is a politics to make globalization both more equitable and stable. The problem is that while the United States has been consistent and clearif one-sidedin its vision of what globalization should look like, the critics and potential agents of global reform have been anything but. Generally, it is fair to say that there is more agreement among anti-globalization activists over what they do not like than on what they positively advocate.\n\nIn part this failing results from the fact that many who oppose globalization are hostile not simply to it, but rather to market economies altogether. In the past, these individuals would have advocated an internationalist socialism. But such an appeal is of course no longer politically tenable. In the light of the experience of the Soviet bloc, it is not credible to maintain that globalization could flourish with the means of production publicly owned. Such critics, therefore, are deprived of the positive vision that animated radicals in the past: an international commonwealth of cooperating economies in which decisions are motivated not by private interests but by the goal of advancing the publics well-being. With the socialist project abandoned, antiglobalization thought, at least in the United States, tends to cluster around two sets of approaches. Activists argue that the United States should take on the resp"
