Aranka Molnár was born on 11 December 1902 in Eger, Hungary. She was an actress, known for the Hungarian silent films A hercegnö pongyolája (1914), A víg özvegy (1912) and Végszó (1920). She died on 28 August 1982 in Kassa/ Kosice, Czechoslovakia. She was the first wife of Aladár Miklósy, mother of György Miklósy, therefore also known as Miklósy Aladárné Molnár Aranka.

Aranka Molnár was the daughter of the Roman Catholic Julius Karl Mayer and the Jewish Flora Steiner. She first appeared on stage in 1917 as a member of Kálmán Balla's company in Sopron, but by the third month of the season she was already playing naive roles. She played in Kecskemét for Miklós Mariházy, in Sopron (from 1920) and in Pécs (1923-24) under the contract of directors László Asszonyi and György Kürthy. Here she had great success in the title role of Tökmag, which she played 22 times in one season. She also appeared in The Three Graces and In the Sun. In 1922 she became a member of the National Association of Actors[and later joined the company of Aladár Miklósy (1925-26), who later became her first husband. They married on 31 August 1924 in Kispest. She was a member of the Municipal Theatre (1926-27), where she was a soubrette primadonna in the song play Legend of Balaton and primadonna in Cseregyerek. She was also a member of the Újpest Theatre (1927-29) and the Kisfaludy Theatre in Óbuda (1929-30). She then performed in the company of Sándor Iván (1930-31). Her second marriage took place in Kassa, at which time she also gave up acting.

Between 1912 and 1922 Molnár acted in five Hungarian silent films: first in A víg özvegy/ The merry widow (Sándor Góth, 1912) with Emil Fenivessy and - in a supporting part - Ica Lenkeffy (her debut), and last in 1922 in Viola, az alföldi haramia/ Viola, the lowland haram (Oszkár Damó) in which Molnar played the title role.
