        "text": "Orlando International Airport\n\nOrlando International Airport (MCO) offers more flights to more places than any other airport in Florida. In fact, the airport recently celebrated its 150th non-stop route, to Medellin, Colombia.\n\nOrlando Executive Airport\n\nConveniently located only three miles from Downtown Orlando, the business and financial center of Central Florida, Orlando Executive Airport (OEA) is the perfect flight path for the corporate traveler. OEA provides 24-hour service through two fixed base operators, an FAA staffed air traffic control tower and full instrument landing system capability.\n\nLYNX Bus Service\n\nThis local bus service provides transportation throughout the City of Orlando, Orange, Seminole, Osceola and Lake Counties, as well as parts of Polk and Volusia Counties. LYNX accommodates an average of 90,000 passenger trips per day, over an area of approximately 2,500 square miles with a resident population of more than 1.8 million.\n\nLYMMO Downtown Circulator\n\nLYMMO is the ultra-convenient FREE bus rapid transit (BRT) circulator that runs seven days a week throughout downtown Orlando. With its own dedicated lane and spotlight system, you can hop aboard and move swiftly between major downtown destinations. Explore routes and hours of operation or view the real-time bus tracker.\n\nSunRail\n\nSunRail provides Central Florida with commuter rail service, Monday through Friday, along a 49-mile route from DeBary in Volusia County to Poinciana in Osceola County. Launched in May of 2014, SunRail currently has 16 stations in four counties, with four stations in Orlando.\n\nAmtrak\n\nThe station was designed by architect M.A. Griffith and built for the Atlantic Coast Railroad in 1926. In 2014-2015, the station underwent major restoration efforts, including restoring the historic façade and twin domes, repairing doors, windows, and the tile roof, repainting, constructing new sidewalks, and installing new landscape and irrigation.\n\nBrightline\n\nBrightline is All Aboard Florida’s intercity express train providing service between Miami, Fort Lauderdale and West Palm Beach. Construction is set to begin in 2019 on the Orlando expansion.\n\nBike Share / Scooter Share Program\n\nAllowing for the operation of businesses that can provide dockless bike sharing and scooter sharing for our residents, works and visitors, is one more way the city is furthering viable, healthy and environmentally sustainable transportation alternatives."
