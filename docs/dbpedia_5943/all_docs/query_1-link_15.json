        "text": "Oando Plc, Nigeria’s leading indigenous energy solutions provider, at the weekend said it posted a N74.7 billon Profit-After-Tax (PAT) in its full year ended 2023 unaudited financials.\n\nThe company said that the profit showed a positive turn in its fortunes in comparison to the preceding year when the company posted a loss after tax.\n\nWithin the larger industry context, Oando’s N74.7 billion PAT compared favourably with indigenous peers over the same period under review such as Seplat Energy which recorded N81.330 billion.\n\nSimilarly, Total Energies Nigeria posted a PAT of N12.912 billion, while Aradel’s PAT stood at N54.2 billion.\n\nDespite what continues to be a challenging business environment and economic headwinds, energy companies like Oando and Seplat amongst others, recorded commendable results.\n\nLast year saw Oando push forward with its growth agenda, recording positive highlights, including the signing of a Sale & Purchase Agreement (SPA) with Italian oil major, Eni to acquire one of its local subsidiaries, the Nigeria Agip Oil Company Limited (NAOC).\n\nIn addition, its clean energy arm, Oando Clean Energy Limited (OCEL) launched its electric mass transit buses in partnership with the Lagos State government, signalling that things are beginning to look up for the indigenous oil firm.\n\nMore significantly the release of the company’s Financial Year End (FYE) 2023 results, albeit unaudited, finally brings the company a step closer to being in line with regulatory requirements for all listed companies.\n\nIt’s also an indication that by the end of this year the company could be on track with its peers in reporting results, thus giving confidence to shareholders and investors on the company’s current state and future.\n\nAlthough 2023 saw oil and gas companies impacted by spikes in incidences of militancy and sabotage, the company said it was still able to record a 71 per cent increase in its turnover to N3.4 trillion compared to N1.9 trillion in FYE 2022.\n\nOver the last four years, the company said it had been consistent in recording a positive incline in turnover, announcing a turnover of N477.1 billion 2020, N803.5 billion in 2021, N2 trillion in 2022 and more recently in 2023, making a total of N3.4 trillion in turnover.\n\nCommenting on the results, Group Chief Executive, Oando Plc, Wale Tinubu, said: “Despite the persistent pipeline vandalism across the Niger Delta, which continues to dampen crude production, we achieved a profit after tax of N 74.7 billion in 2023.\n\n“This was largely driven by increased trading volumes due to our strategic global partnerships and net foreign exchange gains on the group’s foreign currency denominated assets as against losses on our foreign currency denominated liabilities.\n\n“Furthermore, our milestone signing of the Sale and Purchase Agreement with Eni towards the acquisition of 100 per cent of the shares of NAOC Ltd, marked a pivotal moment for our organisation and is poised to unlock substantial synergies in the near future.\n\n“Our focus is now on completing the acquisition and seamlessly integrating operations to deliver exceptional value to our shareholders.”\n\nWith the country seeing a decline in national oil output, precipitated by pipeline vandalism, oil theft and illegal refining, Oando said that its upstream operations saw average daily production increase marginally by 1 per cent to 20,837 boepd in FYE 2023 as against 20,703 boepd in FYE 2022.\n\n“These production numbers comprised of oil production at 6,024bbls/day (vs 4,939bbls/day in FYE 2022); natural gas production of 14,572boe/day (vs 15,292boe/day in FYE 2022) and NGL production of 241bbls/MMscf/day (vs 472bbls/MMscf/day in FYE 2022),” the company stated.\n\nIn its trading operations, Oando said it posted a marked improvement, recording a 50 per cent increase in traded crude oil volumes of 32.8 million bbls FYE 2023 compared to 21.8 million bbls in FYE 2022 and a 15 per cent decrease in traded refined petroleum products, that is, 1,645,535 MT compared to 1,937,833 MT in FYE 2022.\n\nAgainst the backdrop of the interim results, speaking on the company’s strategic focus for the future, Tinubu added: “Having weathered the storm of recent years, our latest results provide a foundation for us to consolidate and build for the future.\n\n“With our planned acquisition of NAOC, we are positioned to take full operatorship and drive-up outputs, value and efficiencies. Moreover, our foray into and leadership in clean energy expand our footprint as a fit and proper integrated energy company with our feet firmly planted in today’s realities and the possibilities of the future.”\n\nEmmanuel Addeh\n\nFollow us on:"
