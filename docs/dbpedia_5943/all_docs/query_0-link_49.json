        "text": "CALGARY, May 16, 2014 /CNW/ - Oando Energy Resources Inc. (\"OER\" or the \"Company\") (TSX:OER), a company focused on oil and gas exploration and production in Nigeria, today announced financial and operating results for the quarter ended March 31, 2014. The unaudited financial statements, notes and management's discussion and analysis pertaining to the period are available on the System for Electronic Document Analysis and Retrieval (\"SEDAR\") at www.sedar.com and by visiting www.oandoenergyresources.com. All monetary figures reported herein are U.S. dollars unless otherwise stated.\n\nAcquisition Highlights\n\nOER is in the final stages of acquiring ConocoPhillips' Nigerian upstream oil and gas business (the \"COP Acquisition\");\n\nIt is expected that the Proposed Acquisition will position OER as one of the leading E&P players in Nigeria, as measured by total reserves and production;\n\nOER believes that the COP Acquisition represents a \"game changing\" opportunity for OER and its shareholders, adding:\n\na 20% working interest in the NAOC JV, which includes forty-one discovered oil and gas fields with remaining oil and gas recovery, approximately forty identified prospects and leads, twelve production stations, approximately 1,490 km of crude oil, natural gas liquids and natural gas pipelines, three gas processing plants, the Brass River Oil Terminal, the Kwale-Okpai 480 MW combined cycle gas-fired power plant, and associated infrastructure;\n\napproximately 36,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day (\"boe/d\") based on average production between January and December 2013, according to ConocoPhillips;\n\napproximately 211 millions of barrels of oil equivalent (\"MMboe\") of Proved plus Probable Reserves, 484 MMboe of Best Estimate Economic Contingent Resources, and approximately 239 MMboe of Risked Prospective Resources, according to a report dated 31st December, 2013, prepared by OER's independent resource and reserve auditors, Petrenel (The Petroleum and Renewable Energy Company Limited). Contingencies and significant negative and positive factors related to the Contingent Resources are further described below.\n\nthe Proposed Acquisition is expected to be financed with already secured debt and equity;\n\nPOCNL is cash generative and is expected to contribute positively to the cashflow of the Company;\n\nthe Proposed Acquisition is anticipated to close during the first half of 2014, to enable the companies to satisfy all closing conditions including the anticipated consent of the Honourable Minister of Petroleum Resources in Nigeria.\n\nIn February 2014, OER completed a $50 million private placement offering and issued 35,070,063 common shares and 17,535,032 common shares purchase warrant at a price of C$1.57 per unit. Each whole warrant entitles the holder to acquire one common share of the Group at a price of C$2.00 per common share for a period of 24 months from the closing of the COP Acquisition;\n\nIn February 2014, OER converted certain amounts outstanding under the Oando PLC ($601 million in principal and accrued interest of $11.7 million) into equity, resulting in the issuance of 432,565,768 common shares in OER and 216,282,884 common shares purchase warrants with identical terms to the $50 million private placement; and\n\nEntered into an amendment agreement with ConocoPhillips (NYSE: COP) to extend the long stop date for completion of the COP Acquisition to June 30, 2014.\n\nOperational Highlights\n\n4,531 bbl/d average oil production for the quarter ended March 31, 2014. This represented a 22% increase over the same period last year. The increase in production was a result of reduced shut-in periods on OML 56 (Ebendo Field) resulting in a 110% production increase over same period in 2013;\n\nAverage gross sales price realized per barrel of oil produced was $111.40 for the quarter ended March 31, 2014 compared to $114.00 for the same period in 2013;\n\nProgressed construction of the 45,000 bbls/d Umuginni pipeline, designed as an alternative evacuation route for the OML 56 (Ebendo Field) asset, with a target completion date of H2, 2014; and\n\n$42.6 million in capital expenditures for the quarter ended March 31, 2014 compared to $8.3 million for comparative prior year period. The majority of these expenditures was on drilling and completion activities.\n\nFinancial Highlights\n\n$32.2 million in revenue for the quarter ended March 31, 2014. This represented a 5% increase from the same period last year;\n\n$(32.9) million in net income for the quarter ended March 31, 2014. The net loss was as primarily as a result of financing expenses relating to the COP Acquisition;\n\n$10.3 million in cash flow from operating activities, compared to cash outflow of $18.0 million from the same period last year;\n\n$300.6 million in cash and cash equivalents for the quarter ended March 31, 2014; and\n\n$354.3 million in borrowings as at March 31, 2014, comprising of convertible loans and acquisition loans to the tune of $233.3 million and operational loans of $121.0 million.\n\n\"Our first quarter was highlighted by positive operational results that saw us increase our year on year oil production by 22%,\" said OER CEO, Pade Durotoye. \"This increase in quarterly production from the Ebendo Field was as a result of a higher production uptime experienced due to reduced shut-in's on the Agip trunkline evacuation route\".\n\nSelected Quarterly Results\n\nOPERATIONAL UPDATE\n\nOML 125 (Abo Field)\n\nBudgeted capital expenditures for OML 125 were set at $37.5 million for 2014. In the three months ended March 31, 2014, OER incurred $26.0 million on Abo 8 re-entering and completions and Abo 12 drilling activities.

However, boe's or Mcfe's may be misleading, particularly if used in isolation. A boe conversion ratio of 6 Mcf = 1 barrel, or a Mcfe conversion ratio of 1 barrel = 6 Mcf, is based on an energy equivalency conversion method primarily applicable at the burner tip and does not represent a value equivalency at the wellhead. Readers are cautioned that boe may be misleading, particularly if used in isolation.\n\nForward Looking Statements:\n\nThis news release contains forward-looking statements and forward-looking information within the meaning of applicable securities laws.
