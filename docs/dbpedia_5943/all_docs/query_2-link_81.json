        "text": "Kirk Leigh\n\nOil prices do not look set to drop drastically in the foreseeable future despite the shale challenge and there is relative stability in the downstream sector, two powerful indicators that players in the oil industry, like OANDO, are likely to benefit from. This throws some light, however dim, into why analysts advice investors to hold their positions in OANDO.\n\nAnalysts revised an earlier forecast that the oil company listed in Lagos and Johannesburg would outperform the market to ‘hold’, according to the Financial Times which polls analysts’ opinions on company performance. This is the consensus forecast as of April 14, 2017.\n\n“As of Apr 14, 2017, the consensus forecast amongst 5 polled investment analysts covering Oando Plc advises investors to hold their position in the company. This has been the consensus forecast since the sentiment of investment analysts deteriorated on Oct 13, 2016. The previous consensus forecast advised that Oando Plc would outperform the market”.\n\nAccording to the FT, the 3 analysts offering 12 month price targets for Oando Plc have a median target of 5.03, with a high estimate of N8.81 and a low estimate of N5.00. The median estimate represents a -10.18% decrease from the last price of N5.60.\n\nAlthough the stock price has risen as high as N6.20 this April, the current price of N5.60 represents capital gains of 34 percent for investors who have been in the stock in the last one year when it traded at N4.18 . The highest point for the stock in as many months was May 27th 2016 when it sold for N7.90.\n\nAgainst the ASI, OANDO has delivered a positive return of 10 percent in the last six months to April 17th 2017 against negative 8 percent by the ASI. The stock also outperformed its nearest competitor, SEPLAT, in the last one year, returning about 35 percent compared to SEPLAT’s 18 percent as both stocks outperform the market. But with the near equal returns turned out by both companies in the last six months, the big jump by OANDO may not be long sustained.\n\nCommenting on the comapany’s performance, in a statement, Wale Tinubu, the company’s Group Chief Executive Officer, says the performance was due to its proactive timely execution of its restructuring programme of growth in upstream division.\n\nAccording to him, some divestments embarked upon by the company during the period under review resulted in a net debt reduction of $125 billion and he attributed the company’s return to profitability to focus on dollar denominated earnings.\n\nAmong the challenges faced by the company in the outgone year, are with liquidity constraints, devaluation of the naira and a slump in oil earnings due to low oil prices intensified by the insurgency in the Niger Delta.\n\nThe last financial year ending December 2016 was quite an eventful one for the oil company as it marked a turnaround from years of weak profitability as it grew year on year revenues 124.03% from N203.43bn to N455.75bn while net income improved from a loss of N50.43bn to a gain of N3.12bn. this is despite suffering loses of N54 billion in the third quarter.\n\nThe company barely escaped another year of loss making owing to huge finance costs, heavy tax outlay and back bending admin costs. Finance costs from borrowing though grew by a marginal 5.8 percent was still staggering at N58.31 billion. It was N55 billion the year before. This led to a reduction in the company’s debt burden by 35 per cent to N230.6 billion in contrast with N355.4 billion posted in 2015.\n\nThe tax burden jumped almost ten times to N37.6 billion from N4.19 billion to help erode bottom line. But it was the vault to N109.3 billion in admin costs from N69.8 billion that probably did the most damage as it led to operating loss of N7.66 billion from operating gains of N10.4 billion achieved the year before.\n\nBut the company is forward looking with a robust investment outlay in the last three years to 2014; in 2014, the oil company invested N193 billion towards improving its facilities. In this regard, investors may be looking at its improved stake in Oando Energy Resources (OER), a Canada based subsidiary quoted on the Toronto Stock Exchange (TXN). Oando, has moved to buy the remaining 6.3 percent of the company, of which it owned 93.7% of OER.\n\nThe company’s cashflow on investment activities sprang to a negative N20.16 billion in the last financial year compared to the positive N23.5 billion in 2015 and N14.77 billion in 2014 to indicate that the company is stepping up investments in its future.\n\nLooking back, it was the $1.5 billion acquisition of Conoco Phillips that jolted the company in the wake of decline oil prices, leading the company to agree to sell its downstream business to oil trading group Vitol. This was a time It also scheduled its power and gas subsidiaries for sale to raise N80 billion through a rights issue."
