        "text": "Founded more than 100 years ago, Orlando Health is a private, not-for-profit healthcare organization with a long tradition of serving its many and varied communities. With physicians in more than 100 specialties, the healthcare system attracts patients from across the state, region and nation.\n\nThe healthcare system encompasses award-winning hospitals, stand-alone emergency departments, behavioral health care, skilled nursing facilities, rehabilitation services and urgent care locations. Our network of primary care physicians and specialists extends from the Atlantic to Gulf coasts and spans more than a dozen counties.\n\nOrlando Health is nationally recognized for its pediatric and adult trauma programs as well as its high-performing community hospitals and specialty hospitals. Each year, we welcome more than 20,000 babies across the system and care for the most fragile in one of the nation’s largest neonatal intensive care units.\n\nThe most-advanced care is offered through our specialty institutes that connect clinical excellence, education and research programs in our core services. With a robust graduate medical education program that hosts more than 350 residents and fellows each academic year, Orlando Health continues its pioneering research that includes therapies for end-stage breast cancer, identifying biomarkers to detect traumatic brain injury and offering first-in-the-world expanded access for an experimental advanced melanoma treatment.\n\nLast year, the healthcare system provided more than $1.3 billion in total community impact in the form of charity care, community benefit programs and services, and community building activities.\n\nA Continuum of Care\n\nPrevention and Wellness\n\nOrlando Health is dedicated to guiding our patients — as well as our team members and the community — toward their optimal health and well-being. Services such as coordinated care, health screenings and lifestyle counseling can benefit all, from children to adults, and lead to improved detection, management and even prevention of many diseases and chronic illnesses.\n\nThree major causes of death in the U.S. — obesity, heart disease and lung cancer — are largely preventable, with modifiable risk factors. Our prevention and wellness care focuses on identifying personal risk factors for developing these and other diseases, and providing the guidance needed to make lifestyle choices to reduce or prevent those risks or help manage existing conditions.\n\nPrimary and Specialty Care\n\nWith more than 1,500 physicians and 650 advanced practice providers, Orlando Health Medical Group has more than 200 practice locations with a wide geographic footprint — covering an area from as far south as Palm Beach to as far west as Tampa and St. Petersburg, and as far north as Daytona Beach and St. Augustine.\n\nThe medical group offers care in dozens of specialties, including cardiology, vascular, orthopedics, oncology, digestive health, neurology, neurosurgery, bariatric surgery, general surgery, bone marrow transplant, more than two dozen pediatric subspecialties, critical care medicine, women’s health and primary care. For even the most complex cases, Orlando Health Medical Group delivers an elevated standard of access, expertise and experience with board-certified specialists, next-level treatments and leading-edge technology.\n\nOrlando Health Physician Associates, the medical group’s network of adult and pediatric primary care doctors, offers same-day and virtual appointments so patients have convenient access to comprehensive primary care services."
