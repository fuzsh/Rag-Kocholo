        "text": "Local-content legislation and policies in oil and gas producing countries have become a key priority of host governments and industry players alike. Increasingly, more resource-rich developing countries are enacting local-content legislation as a means of maximizing the benefits to be gained from their petroleum industries. However, these laws and policies are being implemented with insufficient research into their efficacy, and as a result have often yielded mixed results. This article assesses the effect of local-content legislation and policies in the oil and gas industry presenting insights on the challenges faced by industry players with regard to their implementation. We trace the channels through which local-content legislation advances value creation by evaluating different implementation programmes, using clearly stated local-content targets to measure their efficacy. Nigeria, Ghana, Brazil and Norway are chosen as case study countries to highlight the diversity of local-content strategies for countries at different developmental stages. The motivation for this research is to provide host governments, investors and domestic suppliers with guidelines on how to successfully develop and implement local-content regulations and strategies. The experience of the case study countries above show that the success or otherwise of local-content legislation and policies remains a function of a country's institutional setting and developmental paradigm. Based on the review of the case studies, we summarize that successful local-content legislation and policies should be anchored on the following principles: (i) local-content policies need to look beyond simple generation of economic rents to focus on the development of linkages; (ii) the tools developed to measure agreed local-content benchmarks must be clearly defined to the acceptance of all industry players; and (iii) entrenching local content depends on the availability of an industrial-supply base that can act as growth levers.\n\nFrom its early past as an unwanted energy source, natural gas has now rapidly risen to become the preeminent energy resource of the 21st century. It currently accounts for about 25 per cent of world energy demand. One of the factors responsible for the global rapid growth of demand for natural gas is its environmentally benign characteristic, which has led to its need for power generation and other activities. Nigeria is best viewed as a gas province, with a drop of oil. It has an estimated 187 trillion cubic feet of proven natural gas reserves, the 8th largest in the world. Abundant gas reserves exceed foreseeable needs of the domestic, regional and export markets. However, for a very long period, Nigeria flared a vast majority of its natural gas. While this flared gas has adverse environmental effects and is also a loss of revenue for the government in the form of export revenue receipts, the inability to utilize its natural gas resource also has other negative effects. For instance, this resource could have been channeled to end the country’s power outages and high unemployment rate (by encouraging the proliferation of gas based industries), whilst in the process reverse its citizens declining standard of living. With a belated realization of the foregoing, the Nigerian government currently has in place, a policy to harness its natural gas for domestic uses as well as for export revenues. Additionally, with the knowledge that the export market holds more attraction to gas producers than the domestic market, it further through regulation, placed a domestic gas supply obligation on all gas producers in the country. However, while the policy has been successful in creating an in-country ‘demand’ for gas, it has not been effective in bridging the ‘supply’ gap that currently exist in the country, due to gas producers’ inclination towards expanding LNG exports to the detriment of the domestic market. It is on this basis that this paper seeks to critically evaluate the Nigerian gas policy, with a view to distilling the reasons why gas producers are fragrantly violating the domestic gas supply obligation. The paper will further suggest additional measures that can be used not only to strengthen the domestic gas supply obligation, but also to ensure a right balance is struck between the LNG export industry and the long-term energy needs of the domestic gas market.\n\nThe exploration and production of oil and gas continue to be vigorously pursued by African states and international corporations—both large and small. However, with unpredictable fluctuations in oil prices it becomes more difficult to exploit these resources in ways which accrue net benefits to both the state and its citizens. The oil and gas industry in Africa continues to grow and attract new investment, especially from China and India. Despite the lower price of oil, exploration and production activities continue to be carried out. At the same time, the possibilities for oil and gas to be a blessing narrow. Natural resource-based development has always been a difficult objective for any state. The question now may be whether embracing oil and gas is socially responsible: as renewable energy becomes more cost-effective and societies transition into a post-carbon world, the prospects for African states to make good use of carbon resources are waning. In exploring the closing window for petro-development in Africa, this paper uses a comparative cross-regional analysis of trends and developments to highlight how weak legal frameworks and a lack of institutional capacity pose major challenges for the continent's states in managing their natural resources.\n\nThe study is conducted to analysis the supply chain management paying special attention to the logistics. The aim is to understand the impact of logistics on organization performance, also to help in identifying opportunities for cost/time removals and/or value adding along the supply chain. The company chosen for the study is Royal Dutch Shell Plc. As Shell is the one of the big-gest Oil and Gas Company known in the world and one of the leaders of logistic and supply chain management. Though Shell is working efficiently for providing customers with quality services still there are is-sues with the supply chain which should be taken care of in order to be much better. These factors grouped in Control the Cost, Planning and Risk Management, Suppliers/Owners Relationship Management. Study concluded with some suggestions can be adopted by any organization aiming for better performance in supply chain.\n\nThe study examined the legal and institutional framework for combating gas flaring in Nigeria. The study considered the history, function, effect of oil exploratory activities of oil companies in Nigeria having caused gas flaring resulting in loss of lives and properties in the affected communities where gas is flared. The study relied on primary and secondary sources of information. The primary data included statutes and case laws. Statutes such as the constitution of the federal republic of Nigeria (as amended), criminal code violations, conventions and decided cases. The secondary sorces of information used are books, journal, articles, newspaper, reviews and the internet. This study found that more gas is flared in Nigeria than anywhere else in the world. Estimates are notoriously unreliable but roughly 2.5 billion cubic feet of gas associated with crude oil is wasted in this way every day. This is equal to 40 percent of Africa’s natural gas consumption in 2001 while the annual financial loss to Nigeria is about 2.5 billion dollars. The flares have contributed more green houses gases than all subs Saharan Africa combined. And the flares contain a cocktail of toxins that affect the health and livelihood of local communities exposing Niger delta resident to an increased risk of pre mature death, child respiratory illnesses, asthma and Gas flaring have been condemned severally in different countries of the world. The study concluded that there is no specific legal framework that prohibits gas flaring in Nigeria in spite of the environmental problems associated with it. The existing law that appears to regulate gas flaring in Nigeria is not effective as it does not completely prohibit gas flaring but only provide monetary penalties for continued flaring of gas by oil companies in Nigeria.\n\nThis study was carried out with a view to reviewing the financial statements of companies/operators in the Nigerian petroleum industry with emphasis on determining their level of transparency which is a function of their level of compliance with the provisions of Statements of Accounting Standards (SAS) 14 for the upstream operators and Statements of Accounting Standards (SAS) 17 for the operators in the downstream sector of the industry. It focuses primarily on the financial statements of OANDO PLC for the upstream and downstream analysis being an integrated oil company. The study adopted purely secondary data from the financial statements of OANDO PLC for the period 2006-2010. The findings were presented via tables of compliance index which revealed a substantial compliance with the disclosure requirements of the two standards. The study concludes by making some recommendations to the regulators especially the newly established Financial Reporting Council of Nigeria (FRCN) formerl...\n\nSince Ghana discovered oil in large commercial quantities in 2007, many have questioned whether the country can avoid the resource curse. Defined as the inability of resource rich developing nations to benefit from such resource compared to non-resource rich nations, this thesis has proven mostly true in many developing nations. In this paper, I examine the importance of institutional quality in relation to avoiding the resource curse. I do this by methodically analyzing in historical context various indicators (Rule of Law, Effective Governance and Openness and Accountability), and argue that, resources (in this case, oil) are not in themselves a curse, rather the nature of institutions, whether curse resistant or curse receptive determines such outcome. Through a comparative case study of Nigeria (1960-2000) and Ghana (1972-2012), I demonstrate how weaknesses in the former’s institutional environment (very weak rule of law, ineffective governance and the lack of openness and accountability), contributed to the country’s demise as a resource cursed nation. I also examine Ghana in the same way, demonstrating that the country’s institutions are relatively susceptible to the resource curse due to the mediocre state of its institutional environment and fairly weak rule of law."
