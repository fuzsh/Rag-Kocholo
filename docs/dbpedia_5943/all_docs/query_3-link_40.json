        "text": "1. Green Works Orlando\n\nPromotes green business opportunities, green and efficient municipal operations, natural resource protection, environmentally-friendly lifestyles, local food production, and locally-owned businesses. Orlando Mayor Buddy Dyer appointed a 20-member Task Force to make recommendations for a Community Action Plan to make Orlando one of the most environmentally-friendly cities in the southeast. Chaired by former Orange County Mayor Richard Crotty, the Task Force considered input from 14 round table meetings with subject-matter experts, on 7 topics related to sustainability, in addition to public comment from community meetings and an interactive online forum.\n\n2. Orange County “Our Home for Life” Sustainability Advisory Board\n\n3. The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA)\n\nENERGY STAR – GOAA has 18 facilities enrolled in ENERGY STAR Portfolio Manager, these include its passenger terminal and four gate areas, fire-fighting facilities and all of its administration buildings. These facilities, because of their varied uses, have Energy Use Intensities (EUI) ranging from 13 to 350. Qualified Energy Conservation Measures (ECMs) are implemented as part of GOAA’s ongoing effort to reduce energy use and strive toward the SMP goal to reduce energy use by 10% by 2018.\n\nENERGY STAR PARTNER – ENERGY STAR partners are organizations that commit to protecting the environment through the continuous improvement of energy performance, measuring and tracking energy performance, developing and implementing a sustainability plan, provide outreach and education about the importance of energy efficiency to our staff and community and supporting ENERGY STAR Challenge to reduce energy use by 10%.\n\n4. The US Green Building Council (USGBC)\n\nThe US Green Building Council‘s Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design (LEED) Certification is the most recognized, 3rd party rating system for green buildings in the world. GOAA is a USGBC member and is registered as a LEED for campus projects. This status allows for multiple on-site projects, for both new construction, interiors and existing buildings to register and certify for LEED Certification a part of the campus.\n\n5. The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA)\n\n6. Green Destination Orlando (GDO)\n\nGDO is a community based group of stakeholders (non-profit, government, and business) focused on making Central Florida the premier Green Destination in North America. Recognizing the special role that the hospitality industry plays in the Central Florida economy, the US Green Building Council Central Florida Chapter formed the Hospitality Advocacy Committee (HAC) with the objective is to be a catalyst for the Green Destination program.\n\nGDO’s mission is to establish and Promote Orlando as the premier Green Destination for leisure, convention and business travelers. The vision is a total sustainable EXPERIENCE – from the moment a visitor arrives in Orlando, to the transportation, from their stay at local lodging, to their daily activities (be it a conference or family vacation), and all the way back home – a complete loop that never breaks – a total sustainable EXPERIENCE.\n\n7. The Central Florida Energy Efficiency Alliance (CFEEA)\n\nIn 2009, the U.S. Department of Energy awarded Orange County with the Energy Efficiency & Conservation Block Grant (EECBG) to develop the Central Florida Energy Efficiency Alliance (CFEEA) with goal to create and promote programs to reduce the energy consumption in the largest buildings in Central Florida.\n\nThe creation of CFEEA brought together a powerful group of community stakeholders as founding members. They include the City of Orlando, Orange County, The Greater Orlando Aviation Authority (GOAA), Orange County Public Schools (OCPS), University of Central Florida (UCF), the US Green Building Council (USGBC), local utility providers and others all focused on reducing commercial and municipal energy use.\n\nThe CFEEA members created the Kilowatt Crackdown Challenge as a simple and effective building energy initiative using the EPA’s ENERGY STAR Portfolio Manager (ESPM) Tool. Participants received free technical support, recommendations on how to reduce energy use and recognition in CFEEA’s annual award ceremonies.\n\nAs a testament to its wide success 1,982 facilities across central Florida joined ENERGY STAR Portfolio Manager and participated in the CFEEA’s Kilowatt Crackdown Challenge. In 2012, CFEEA was selected for the Excellence in ENERGY STAR Award by the EPA.\n\nDisclaimer and Conditions of Use\n\nThe MCO Investor Relations site provides general financial information about the Greater Orlando Aviation Authority (GOAA) and its outstanding bonds, notes or other obligations.
