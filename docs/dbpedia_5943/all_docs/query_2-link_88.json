The performance of vendors is monitored to determine if the business relationship should be continued or discontinued.\n\nIn supporting the company’s fight against corruption and unethical practices, the company establishes a framework through which the company may suspend dealings with business partners for a failure to comply with OER policies and procedures and the Corporate Code of Business Conduct and Ethics. The policy applies to the adherence by Business Partners to contractual terms, safety, standards of ethics, financial property and human rights in the provision of goods and/ or services.\n\nBid Process\n\nThe process is aimed at ensuring transparency and upholding the Company’s integrity in all business activities undertaken whilst simultaneously obtaining value for money.
