        "text": "Article content\n\nA case study in the benefits of perseverance. That’s the appropriate term to describe the path taken by Oando Energy Resources over the past eight plus years.\n\nConsider how it started: Through Exile Resources in late 2005 it raised $2-million in an initial public offering. It followed that up with a $820,000 flow through raise, owned a right to earn a stake in a property in Alberta and it planned to make a joint application for a property in Ghana and Cameroon.\n\nWe apologize, but this video has failed to load.\n\nTry refreshing your browser, or\n\ntap here to see other videos from our team.\n\nBehind Oando Energy's rise to $940-million from $2-million in eight years Back to video\n\nConsider this week’s news: It has received the approval of the Nigerian government for the US$1.65-billion acquisition of the upstream oil and gas business owned in Nigeria by ConocoPhillips. Oando (OER/TSX), which closed Thursday at $1.67, has a market cap of $940-million.\n\nAdvertisement 2\n\nStory continues below\n\nThis advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below.\n\nTHIS CONTENT IS RESERVED FOR SUBSCRIBERS ONLY\n\nSubscribe now to read the latest news in your city and across Canada.\n\nExclusive articles from Barbara Shecter, Joe O'Connor, Gabriel Friedman, and others.\n\nDaily content from Financial Times, the world's leading global business publication.\n\nUnlimited online access to read articles from Financial Post, National Post and 15 news sites across Canada with one account.\n\nNational Post ePaper, an electronic replica of the print edition to view on any device, share and comment on.\n\nDaily puzzles, including the New York Times Crossword.\n\nSUBSCRIBE TO UNLOCK MORE ARTICLES\n\nSubscribe now to read the latest news in your city and across Canada.\n\nExclusive articles from Barbara Shecter, Joe O'Connor, Gabriel Friedman and others.\n\nDaily content from Financial Times, the world's leading global business publication.\n\nUnlimited online access to read articles from Financial Post, National Post and 15 news sites across Canada with one account.\n\nNational Post ePaper, an electronic replica of the print edition to view on any device, share and comment on.\n\nDaily puzzles, including the New York Times Crossword.\n\nREGISTER / SIGN IN TO UNLOCK MORE ARTICLES\n\nCreate an account or sign in to continue with your reading experience.\n\nAccess articles from across Canada with one account.\n\nShare your thoughts and join the conversation in the comments.\n\nEnjoy additional articles per month.\n\nGet email updates from your favourite authors.\n\nSign In or Create an Account\n\nEmail Address\n\nor\n\nArticle content\n\n“It has been a long journey, wherein we kept faith with our strategy and executed every milestone diligently. This acquisition satisfies our criteria for assets in production, as well as excellent appraisal and exploration prospects. The coast now stands clear for us to immediately complete the acquisition,” said Wale Tinubu, OER’s delighted chairman, adding the acquisition is expected to be completed by month end.\n\nIf that deadline is met, then the closing will come more than 18 months after the acquisition, largely onshore assets that will give Oando a 20% stake. Italy’s Agip Oil owns 20% and the government the 60% balance.\n\nBut to get to the stage where a TSX-Venture listed company, which had market cap at the time of $150-million, opted to try and buy an operation more than 10 times its size, Oando changed, adapted and took some risks. But there is at least one constant: Chris Harrop, a former analyst/investment, has been a director from day one. Harrop couldn’t be reached for comment.\n\nHere are the key milestones.\n\n• November 2006. After striking out in pursuing opportunities in Cameroon and Ghana, Exile strikes a deal to acquire, through a farm-in, a 40% stake in an oil and gas discovery in Nigeria, the so-called Akepo field. It bought the stake in the undeveloped field from a Nigerian oil company, Sogenal Ltd.\n\nAdvertisement 3\n\nStory continues below\n\nThis advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below.\n\nArticle content\n\n• Oct. 2009. Exile and Sonegal complete a deal where Nigerian-based Oando plc is granted 75% of Exile’s 40% interest in the Akepo field “in return for funding Exile’s past costs, and financing the future development of the project.”\n\nAs things turned out, that farm-in was a turning point for Exile. It gave the company exposure to a large Nigerian company and allowed the two to work together – and build a relationship. It also paved the way for Exile’s next transaction.\n\n• July 2011. Oando inquires, informally, about a broader relationship. In time, a deal is hatched where Exile would acquire all of Oando’s upstream exploration and producing assets in exchange for stock. One month later the parties announce an intention to proceed. Oando’s market cap is less than $150-million\n\n• July 2012. The deal – effectively a reverse takeover – is completed. Because Exile is required to issue so many shares, it consolidates its stock on a one new share for 16.28 old shares. Even so, it issues 100 million new shares. Exile changed its name and the shares were listed on the TSX.\n\nArticle content\n\nShare this article in your social network"
