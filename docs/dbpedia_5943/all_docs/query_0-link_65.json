The country is the largest oil producer in Africa and the sixth largest in the world, with oil contributing over 90% of its export revenue. The industry is dominated by multinational companies such as Shell, ExxonMobil, Chevron, and Total, which have been operating in the country for decades. There are also several indigenous companies such as Aiteo, Oando, and Seplat that have emerged in recent years and are making significant contributions to the sector. The industry faces challenges such as pipeline vandalism, oil theft, and political instability, but it remains a critical part of Nigeria's economy and a major source of employment and government revenue.",
