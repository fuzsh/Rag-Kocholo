        "text": "Oando Plc, Nigeria’s largest integrated energy firm, plans to raise more than $1 billion in South Africa over the next five years after completing its secondary listing on the Johannesburg Stock Exchange (JSE), to enable the company meet its expansion drive. According to the company’s CEO, Adewale Tinubu, the capital would be raised in several tranches to fund Oando’s entry into the Nigerian refining and power sectors, and possibly exploration and production activities.\n\n\"We are also in the process of finalizing the terms we will be listing before the end of this year in the Johannesburg Stock Exchange. Our goal is to show the rest of Africa that there are a lot of positive things to look up to in Nigeria. The politicians have done their best by signing the NEPAD Accord. It’s up to the business people, not foreign this time, but truly, home grown, indigenous, African companies to take that message outside to the rest of Africa. We have done that in West Africa.\" The company is active in several West African countries besides Nigeria including, Ghana, Liberia and Sierra Leone. Tinubu says the company is trying to spread its tentacles elsewhere and push the company to the next frontier of growth.\n\nWhile the company has interests in other West African countries, its main focus is in Nigeria were it is involved in a myriad of projects, mostly in the downstream sector. The company built Nigeria’s first local distribution gas pipeline in Lagos and is in the process of designing three power plants to be built in the Lagos area\n\nSince its conception the company has diversified into the energy services business, probably Nigeria’s biggest indigenous oil services company with over $200 million in servicing contracts.\n\nIn the latest bid round the company made its move into the exploration and production side of the industry. Oando was a successful bidder on three blocks and plans to take its E & P subsidiary public I the near future.\n\nWe were successful in three blocs during the Nigeria 2005 bid round. We have an exploration and production subsidiary, which will be made public soon. We will be capitalizing and expanding it a little further.\n\nThe Oando group has a market capitalization of $400 million, the sixth-largest company listed on the Nigerian Stock Exchange, and plans to dual-list in Johannesburg by the end of this year. The listing, originally planned for next month, had been delayed by technical issues that were a result of Oando being the first Nigerian company to seek a listing on the JSE."
