        "text": "Lagos, Nigeria – Oando PLC (referred to as “Oando” or the “Group”), Nigeria’s leading indigenous energy group listed on both the Nigerian and Johannesburg Stock Exchange, today announced audited results for the twelve months period ended December 31, 2022.\n\nHIGHLIGHTS\n\nOperational\n\nUpstream: 23% decrease in production: 20,703boe/day FYE 2022 vs 26,775boe/day FYE 2021\n\nOil production of 4,939bbls/day (vs 8,849bls/day in FYE 2021)\n\nNatural Gas production of 15,292boe/day (vs 16,227boe/day in FYE 2021)\n\nNGL production of 472bbls/day (vs 1,699bbls/day in FYE 2021)\n\nTrading:\n\n25% increase in traded crude oil volumes 21.8 million bbls FYE 2022 vs 17.4 million bbls FYE 2021\n\n101% increase in traded refined petroleum products (1,937,833 MT in 2022 vs 962,371 MT in FYE 2021)\n\nFinancial\n\n148% Turnover increase.

This was further compounded by a major gas plant fire incident which also necessitated a lengthy downtime.\n\nFurthermore, a rise in our net interest expense due to increased interest rates on several of our major facilities in line with global rates increases, also contributed to our Loss after Tax position.\n\nIn response, we have put in place definitive measures to bolster our production and cash inflows towards ensuring a speedy return to profitability by collaborating with our partners to institute a comprehensive security framework aimed at permanently curbing the persistent pipeline vandalism whilst concurrently exploring inorganic growth opportunities to increase our reserves and production capabilities. We have also implemented a strategic restructuring of our key facilities to ensure they align with our cash flow dynamics.”\n\nOPERATIONS REVIEW\n\nUpstream:\n\nProduction for the twelve months ended 31 December 2022:\n\nFYE 2022 FYE 2021 % Change Crude Oil (bbls/day) 4,9398 8,849 -44% NGLs (bbl/MMscf) 472 1,699 -72% Natural Gas (boe/day) 15,292 16,227 -6% Total (boe/day) 20,703 26,775 -23%\n\nDuring the twelve months ended December 31, 2022, average production was 20,703 boe/day, compared to 26,775 boe/day in 2021. In 2022, production consisted of 4,939 bbls/day of crude oil, 472 boe/day of NGLs and 91,752 mcf/day (15,292 boe/day) of natural gas. Production decreases were a result of production downtimes from shut-in due to repairs and persistent sabotage activities.\n\nDuring the twelve months to December 31, 2022, the Group incurred $101.9 million on capital expenditures related to the development of oil and gas assets and exploration and evaluation activities, compared to $63.4 million in the twelve months to December 31, 2021.\n\nCapital Expenditures in 2022 consisted of $77.7 million at OMLs 60 to 63 incurred on oil and gas properties, $22.6 million at OML 56, $0.2 million at OML 13 and $1.4 million capital expenditure recorded on other assets.\n\nTrading:\n\nTraded volumes for the twelve months ended 31 December 2022:\n\nTraded Volumes FYE 2022 FYE 2021 % Change Crude Oil (bbls) 21,820,894 17,445,55 25% Refined Products (MT) 1,937,833 962,371 101%\n\nIn FYE 2022, Oando Trading sold approximately 21.8 million barrels of crude oil under various contracts with the Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation (NNPC) and delivered 1,937,833 MT of refined products.\n\nFINANCE REVIEW\n\nN Million (unless otherwise stated) FYE 2022 FYE 2021 % Change Revenue 1,933,754,362 804,796,463 148% Operating Loss 20,584,252 78,829,219 -74% (Loss)/Profit-After-Tax (81,230,816) 32,858,799 -347% Total Borrowings 507,336,741 460,782,000 10% Average Realized Oil Price (US$/bbl) 109.55 62.14 76% Average Realized Gas Price (US$/boe) 14.74 9.95 48% Average Realized NGL Price (US$/boe) 6.23 7.16 -13%\n\nRevenue\n\nRevenue for the period was positively impacted by a significant increase in traded crude oil and refined products volumes, as well as higher realized average crude oil and natural gas prices. However, this was negatively impacted by a 23% decline in production due to increased sabotage activities across the Niger Delta, feed gas supply constraints. and a 13% decline in realized average NGL price.\n\nOperating Profit\n\nThe decrease in Operating Profit in 2022 compared to 2021 was due to the absence in 2022, of significant one-off large reversals of impairments which occurred in 2021, the rationale of which was explained in detail in our 2021 Audited Financials and Financial Press Release. This was slightly offset by a 23% decrease in Administrative Expenses in 2022.\n\nLoss-After-Tax\n\nThe above factors, coupled with a marked rise in our net interest expense due to increased interest rates on several of our major facilities in line with increases in global interest rates.\n\nTotal Borrowings\n\nTotal Borrowings increased by 10% to N507.3billion (compared to N460.8 billion in FYE 2021).\n\nEnds.\n\nFor further information, please contact:\n\nAyotola Jagun\n\nCompany Secretary\n\nThe Wings Office Complex\n\n17a Ozumba Mbadiwe Avenue\n\nVictoria Island,\n\nLagos, Nigeria.\n\nTel: +234 (201) 270400, Ext 6159\n\najagun@oandoplc.com\n\nAdeola Ogunsemi\n\nChief Financial Officer\n\nThe Wings Office Complex\n\n17a Ozumba Mbadiwe Avenue\n\nVictoria Island,\n\nLagos, Nigeria.\n\nTel: +234 (201) 270400, Ext 6506\n\naogunsemi@oandoplc.com\n\nFor Oando PLC"
