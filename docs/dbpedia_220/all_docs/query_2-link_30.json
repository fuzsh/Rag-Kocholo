Twenty-fifth Printing, February 1931\n\n26. Twenty-sixth Printing, October 1931 (first posthumous printing)\n\nIn addition to the book’s standard edition (15.5 cm x 22 cm), Knopf also published two other formats: a special, holiday deluxe edition in a slipcase (21 cm x 27.5 cm) and a pocket edition (11.5 cm x 14.5 cm).\n\nOf the deluxe edition, only one printing was published in Gibran’s lifetime. It was in November 1926, the second dating posthumously from October 1938. Of the pocket edition, seven printings were published in Gibran’s lifetime, namely:\n\n1. First published March 1927\n\n2. Second Printing, July 1927\n\n3. Third Printing, January 1928\n\n4. Fourth Printing, September 1928\n\n5. Fifth Printing, July 1929\n\n6. Sixth Printing, January 1930\n\n7. Seventh Printing, September 1930\n\n8. Eighth Printing, July 1931 (first posthumous printing)\n\nEarly translations of \"The Prophet\"\n\nAs far as early translations are concerned, the very first foreign-language version of The Prophet was published in Munich, Germany, in 1925, under the German title Der Prophet, translated by Baron Georg-Eduard von Stietencron (1888-1974). Only 800 numbered copies of his translation are known to have been printed.6\n\nIn 1926, two other translations were published, first in Arabic by a young clergyman, the Lebanese-born Antonios Bashir7 (1889-1966), who later became the Orthodox Archbishop of New York and the Metropolitan of All North America, the ruling bishop of the North American archdiocese of the Church of Antioch. His translation, under the title al-Nabī, was published in Cairo.8\n\nThe other translation that was published that same year was in French, under the title Le Prophète. The book was translated by a young, then 18-year old, American poet named Madeline Mason (1908-1990). Only 750 numbered copies of Le Prophète were printed, of which 25 copies on Japon paper (from no. 1 to no. 25) and 725 on Vélin de Rives paper (from no. 26 to no. 750). Madeline Mason spent much of her childhood and teenage years in England and France where her parents had homes, hence her excellent command of the French language. In the early 1920s, Gibran drew a pencil portrait of her, and they became close friends. One year before Le Prophète was published in Paris, Madeline Mason had her first collection of poems published in London under the title Hill Fragments, with reproductions of five drawings by Gibran.9\n\nThe fourth translation of The Prophet to have ever been published was the Dutch version. Under the title De Profeet, it came out in The Hague, The Netherlands, in 1927. The translator was Liesbeth Christina Valckenier-Suringar (1901-1956), a social worker and teacher from Amsterdam.10\n\nLater came the translations in Yiddish as Der novi by Isaac Horowitz in 1929, in Chinese as Xiānzhī by Bing Xin in 1931, and in Italian as Il Profeta by Eirene Niosi-Risos (a.k.a. Antonia Irene Risos) in 1936.11\n\nFrom “Sleeping mother” to “sleepless mother”\n\nFrom the first printing of The Prophet up to the third, the latter being part of our personal collection, the short sentence at the top of page 10 reads as follows: “And you, vast sea, sleeping mother.” To our surprise, when we acquired the 12th printing, we came upon the same sentence and realised that it was not quite the same sentence indeed: “And you, vast sea, sleeping mother” had become “And you, vast sea, sleepless mother.” The first deluxe edition of November 1926 and the first pocket edition of March 1927 both contain the updated sentence.\n\nSo, betwixt August 1924 (3rd printing of the standard edition) and November 1926 (deluxe edition), something had happened that made Gibran want to change that very sentence. Madeline Mason’s Le Prophète (1926) contains the following translation: “Et vous, onde infinie, mère sans sommeil” (literally: “And you, boundless waters, sleepless mother”). Considering that Madeline and Gibran were close friends, and that he was proficient in French12, we may assume with a fairly high degree of certainty that the two of them reviewed her French translation together. Most probably, Madeline translated The Prophet in the course of 1924 and 1925, during the same period her collection of poems was completed and prepared for publication. At that time, she must have interacted closely with Gibran for the selection of the drawings that he let her use as illustrations in Hill Fragments.\n\nCould it be that one of Madeline’s poems from Hill Fragments triggered in Gibran’s mind the change from “sleeping mother” to “sleepless mother”? That is a hypothesis that we believe to be highly plausible. Unfortunately, it cannot be confirmed because neither of the protagonists is alive today. From Hill Fragments, one poem is titled “The Ocean”. It clearly refers to the restlessness, or sleeplessness, of the ocean, or sea, that knows no pause...\n\nTHE OCEAN\n\nO thou restless one,\n\nWhat mighty urge is in thy bosom\n\nThat nor night nor day\n\nThy striving knoweth pause?\n\nThou toilest ever to outreach thy bounds; Thou movest onward,\n\nThough the shroud of Night\n\nLie heavy on thy breast;\n\nAnd in the golden sun\n\nThou leapest merrily\n\nTo distant goals.\n\nEarth fain would stay thee.\n\n0, thou art merciless:\n\nThou woundest her\n\nUntil the bonds are rent\n\nThat hold thee.\n\nAnd yet thou lovest her well.\n\nBut in thy longing for thine own fulfilment Is thy passion,\n\nAnd though thou bringest treasures\n\nAnd with tender sighing\n\nLayest them before her,\n\nYet art thou ever distant,\n\nLonely, unapproachable.\n\n0 thou restless one,\n\nWhat mighty urge is in thy bosom\n\nAs down the timeless aisles of Space\n\nThou criest evermore: “Beyond! Beyond!”13\n\nWe recently managed to acquire the 4th printing of the standard edition, and the sentence at the top of page 10 reads: “And you, vast sea, sleepless mother”. We can now narrow down the period of time during which Gibran decided on the change: between August 1924 (3rd printing) and January 1925 (4th printing), i.e. during the second half of the year 1924, one year after the publication of the first edition (September 1923).\n\nIn Gibran’s body of writings, we have managed to identify two texts that refer to the restless or sleepless sea. The first, titled “Revelation”, is from the collection of poems, under the title Prose Poems, that was published by Knopf in 1934, with a foreword by Barbara Young. It was translated from the Arabic by Andrew Ghareeb. The Arabic version of the poem first appeared in Al-Funoon in March 1916, whilst its English version appeared for the first time in the Syrian World in June 1931.\n\nREVELATION\n\nWhen the night waxed deep and slumber cast its cloak upon the face of the earth,\n\nI left my bed and sought the sea, saying to myself:\n\n\"The sea never sleeps, and the wakefulness of the sea brings comfort to a sleepless soul.\"\n\nWhen I reached the shore, the mist had already descended from the mountain tops\n\nAnd covered the world as a veil adorns the face of a maiden.\n\nThere I stood gazing at the waves, listening to their singing, and considering the power that lies behind them—\n\nThe power that travels with the storm, and rages with the volcano, that smiles with smiling flowers and makes melody with murmuring brooks.\n\nAfter a while I turned, and lo,\n\nI beheld three figures sitting upon a rock near by,\n\nAnd I saw that the mist veiled them, and yet it veiled them not.\n\nSlowly I walked toward the rock whereon they sat, drawn by some power which I know not.\n\nA few paces off I stood and gazed upon them, for there was magic in the place\n\nWhich crystallized my purpose and bestirred my fancy.\n\nAnd at that moment one of the three arose, and with a voice that seemed to come from the sea depths he said:\n\n“Life without love is like a tree without blossoms or fruit.\n\nAnd love without beauty is like flowers without fragrance, and fruit without seeds.\n\nLife, Love, and Beauty are three entities in one self, free and boundless,\n\nWhich know neither change nor separation.”\n\nThis he said, and sat again in his place.\n\nThen the second figure arose, and with a voice like the roar of rushing waters he said:\n\n“Life without rebellion is like the seasons without a spring.\n\nAnd rebellion without right is like spring in an arid and barren desert.\n\nLife, Rebellion, and Right are three entities in one self,\n\nAnd in them is neither change nor separation.”\n\nThis he said, and sat again in his place.\n\nThen the third figure arose, and spoke with a voice like the peal of the thunder, saying:\n\n“Life without freedom is like a body without a spirit.\n\nAnd freedom without thought is like a spirit confounded.\n\nLife, Freedom, and Thought are three entities in one eternal self,\n\nWhich neither vanish nor pass away.”\n\nThen the three arose and with voices of majesty and awe they spoke:\n\n“Love and all that it begets,\n\nRebellion and all that it creates,\n\nFreedom and all that it generates,\n\nThese three are aspects of God...\n\nAnd God is the infinite mind of the finite and conscious world.”\n\nThen silence followed, filled with the stirring of invisible wings and the tremor of the ethereal bodies.\n\nAnd I closed my eyes, listening to the echo of the saying which I heard."
