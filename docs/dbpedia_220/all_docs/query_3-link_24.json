        "text": "Editor’s note: The list below is CPJ’s most recent and preliminary account of journalist casualties in the war. Our database will not include all of these cases until we have completed further investigations into the circumstances surrounding them. For more information, read our FAQ.\n\n“Since the war in Gaza started, journalists have been paying the highest price–their lives–for their reporting. Without protection, equipment, international presence, communications, or food and water, they are still doing their crucial jobs to tell the world the truth,” said CPJ Program Director Carlos Martinez de la Serna in New York. “Every time a journalist is killed, injured, arrested, or forced to go to exile, we lose fragments of the truth. Those responsible for these casualties face dual trials: one under international law and another before history’s unforgiving gaze.”\n\nJournalists are civilians and are protected by International Law. Deliberately targeting civilians constitutes a war crime. In May, the International Criminal Court announced it was seeking arrest warrant applications for Hamas and Israeli leaders for war crimes and crimes against humanity. To date, CPJ has determined that at least three journalists were directly targeted by Israeli forces in killings which CPJ classifies as murders, but is still researching the details for confirmation in at least 10 other cases that indicate possible targeting.\n\nAs of August 9:\n\n113 journalists and media workers were confirmed killed: 108 Palestinian, two Israeli, and three Lebanese.\n\n32 journalists were reported injured.\n\n2 journalists were reported missing.\n\n52 journalists were reported arrested.\n\nMultiple assaults, threats, cyberattacks, censorship, and killings of family members.\n\nCPJ is also investigating numerous unconfirmed reports of other journalists being killed, missing, detained, hurt, or threatened, and of damage to media offices and journalists’ homes.\n\nThe list published here includes names based on information obtained from CPJ’s sources in the region and media reports. It includes all journalists* involved in news-gathering activity. It is not always immediately clear whether all of these journalists were covering the conflict at the time of their deaths, but CPJ has included them in its count as it investigate their circumstances.\n\nThe list is being updated on a regular basis, with names being removed if CPJ confirms that those members of the media were not working journalists at the time they were killed, injured or went missing.\n\nIsrael Defense Forces (IDF) has repeatedly told media outlets that the army does not deliberately target journalists. It also told agencies in October that it cannot guarantee the safety of the journalists. CPJ has called for an end to the longstanding pattern of impunity in cases of journalists killed by the IDF.\n\nU.N. experts have raised concerns over the killings of journalists, saying in a February statement that they were “alarmed at the extraordinarily high numbers of journalists and media workers who have been killed, attacked, injured and detained in the Occupied Palestinian Territory, particularly in Gaza, in recent months blatantly disregarding international law.”\n\nJournalists and media workers reported killed, missing, or injured:\n\nKILLED\n\nJuly 31, 2024\n\nIsmail Al Ghoul\n\nAl Ghoul, a 27-year-old Palestinian journalist working for the Qatar-funded Al Jazeera Arabic TV channel, was killed in an Israeli strike on a car he and his colleague Rami Al Refee were using in Al Shatei camp, near Gaza City, according to Al Jazeera and multiple news reports. Those sources said that Al Ghoul was wearing a press vest when he was killed.\n\nAl Ghoul and Al Refee were covering the aftermath of the assassination of the senior Hamas leader Ismail Haniyeh, reporting from in front of Haniyeh’s home in Gaza an hour before they were killed.\n\nAl Jazeera said in its live coverage that Al Ghoul and Al Refee were leaving the scene after an Israeli strike hit a building near Haniyeh’s home. Al Jazeera northern Gaza correspondent Anas Al Sharif said that the journalists in the area left in two vehicles, Al Ghoul and Al Refee’s car was hit about five minutes later. That account is similar to that of Al Araby TV’s correspondent, Islam Badr, who said that no clashes were taking place in the area.\n\nAl Jazeera said that it believes the journalists were deliberately targeted.\n\nThe broadcaster aired videos of the first moments after the strike hit the journalists’ vehicle, showing the car moving backwards from the impact. It also broadcast footage filmed by journalists and first responders in the scene, showing Al Ghoul and Al Refee being removed from the car. Al Sharif said that Al Ghoul’s head was severed from his body. The journalists’ bodies were taken to Al Maamadani hospital, where colleagues said their last goodbyes.\n\nIn a statement, Al Jazeera Media Network said that Israeli forces targeted Al Ghoul and Al Refee’s vehicle with a missile, “resulting in a cold-blooded assassination.” The network pledged to “pursue all legal actions to prosecute the perpetrators of these crimes and stands in unwavering solidarity with all journalists in Gaza.”\n\nThe Israel Defense Forces confirmed on August 1 that it had killed Al Ghoul in an airstrike, alleging that he was a member of Hamas’ military wing and that “his activities in the field were a vital part of Hamas’ military activity.” According to the IDF, Al Ghoul had instructed other operatives on how to record operations “and was actively involved in recording and publicizing attacks against IDF troops.”\n\nAl Jazeera strongly rejected what it called “baseless allegations” about Al Ghoul. The network said that the accusation, “which Israel presented without proof,” was an attempt to justify the “deliberate killing” of Al Ghoul and Al Refee. Al Jazeera Media Network said the accusation against Al Ghoul “highlights Israel’s long history of fabrications and false evidence used to cover up its heinous crimes.”\n\nAl Ghoul was previously arrested by the IDF at Al Shifa hospital in Gaza City. The Al Jazeera Media Network statement said that his release from detention “debunks and refutes their false claim of his affiliation” with any organization.\n\nAl Jazeera said that Al Ghoul joined the network in November 2023, dedicating all his time and effort to covering the war. It called for an independent international investigation into the crimes committed against its journalists and staff.\n\nAl Ghoul, one of the few reporters remaining in northern Gaza, had more than 620,000 Instagram followers and was well-known for his appearances on Al Jazeera. He was married and the father of a toddler, Zeina, who had not seen him since the war began. Al Ghoul was buried in Gaza City on July 31, 2024.\n\nRami Al Refee\n\nAl Refee, a 27-year-old Palestinian camera operator who worked for the local National News Agency and was freelancing for Al Jazeera during the Israel-Gaza war, was killed in an Israeli strike on a car he and his colleague Ismail Al Ghoul were using in Al Shatei camp, near Gaza City, according to Al Jazeera and multiple news reports.\n\nAl Ghoul and Al Refee were covering the aftermath of the assassination of the senior Hamas leader Ismail Haniyeh, reporting from in front of Haniyeh’s home in Gaza an hour before they were killed.\n\nAl Jazeera said in its live coverage that Al Ghoul and Al Refee were leaving the scene after an Israeli strike hit a building near Haniyeh’s home. Al Jazeera northern Gaza correspondent Anas Al Sharif said that the journalists in the area left in two vehicles, Al Ghoul and Al Refee’s car was hit about five minutes later.

He obtained a master’s degree in journalism from the Islamic University of Gaza and freelanced for multiple outlets, including the privately owned, Qatar-funded Ultra Palestine news site, and the Abu Dhabi-based magazine Zahrat Al Khaleej, it said.\n\nSince October 7, Abu Jasser frequently reported on airstrikes and funerals in northern Gaza. On October 13, he posted on Facebook, “For me and all my family, we’re not leaving.”\n\nOn Facebook, Abu Jasser shared multiple emotional posts about the agony of losing his brother, Abdallah, during the war.

Its last project was a video for a song by Sol Band recorded in Gaza during the war about the deaths of Palestinian children.

She started as an editor in the news division and then became also a presenter, where she shined.

In his last correspondence with us, he told me that he’s safe and he wants to resume working soon, but I later learned about his death from the news.” Sharrouf added, “Mohammed was a very professional journalist. He wanted to relay the voices of the people. He worked hard on his pieces and was very keen on factual reporting of the daily life of Gaza’s people, despite all the challenges that a journalist like him faces. Unfortunately, he was killed before he got to do what he wanted in journalism; and the most horrific heartbreaking part was that he thought he would survive.”\n\nOn assignment?
