As we look to the future, it's clear that RTB will continue to play a vital role in shaping the industry. By 2025, the RTB market is projected to reach a staggering $35.4 billion, up from $12.4 billion in 2022. So, what does the future hold for RTB? For starters, we can expect to see increased adoption of advanced technologies like AI and machine learning. These technologies will enable more precise targeting, improved efficiency, and greater transparency. In fact, a recent study found that AI-powered RTB campaigns see an average increase of 25% in ROI. Case in point: When a leading automotive brand partnered with a prominent SSP, they leveraged AI-powered RTB to target high-intent audiences. The result? A 30% increase in conversions and a 20% decrease in CPA. Another key trend shaping the future of RTB is the rise of first-party data. As third-party cookies become a thing of the past, advertisers will turn to first-party data to fuel their RTB campaigns. This shift will lead to more accurate targeting, improved customer experiences, and increased brand loyalty. The future of RTB is bright. With advancements in technology, increased adoption of first-party data, and growing demand for transparency and efficiency, RTB will continue to drive innovation and growth in the digital advertising landscape. Stay ahead of the curve and get ready to harness the power of RTB! #RTB #applabs #ProgrammaticAdvertising #DigitalMarketing #AdTech #RealTimeAdvertising #OnlineAdvertising #TargetedAds #DataDrivenMarketing #AdExchange #RealTimeBidding\n\n6\n\n🌟 Exciting findings from our latest Twitter account data analysis on aartipaarti! 📊✨ 🔍 After analyzing the top emojis used by @aartipaarti, we discovered some fascinating insights: 1️⃣ The sparkles emoji ✨ was the most frequently used, appearing 78 times, adding a touch of magic to the tweets. 2️⃣ The yellow heart 💛 came in second place with 62 uses, spreading warmth and positivity. 3️⃣ The backhand index pointing down emoji 👇🏾 was used 48 times, possibly indicating engagement or call-to-action. 4️⃣ Interestingly, the Christmas tree 🎄 and shopping cart 🛒 emojis made appearances, hinting at festive and shopping-related content. 5️⃣ Other popular emojis included fire 🔥, party popper 🎉, red heart ❤️, jack-o-lantern 🎃, and ghost 👻, adding variety and fun to the tweets. 📈 These insights showcase the diverse and engaging content shared by @aartipaarti, resonating with their audience through creative emoji usage. 🔗 You can view the full report here: https://lnkd.in/dtiWjM2y #DataAnalytics #TwitterInsights #EmojiAnalysis #DigitalMarketing #SocialMediaAnalysis Let's keep uncovering the power of data together! 💡🚀\n\nPleased to launch my new website, www.rushbhana.com. It has been an incredible journey working with global brands and agency networks in Dubai, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, and Africa. In my teens, I was always fascinated by the high-energy and fast-paced visuals of SuperSport advertising while watching my favorite football, cricket, or rugby match. I wondered how these ads were even created... I'm excited to say that all the projects I've led and managed have met their strategic and business objectives, along with their attractive visual language, its sexiness, raw energy, and emotion within the motion. (Of course, this is attributed to the great clients, agency leaders, and colleagues.) I'll end this off with my favourite saying: “When you hired an accountant, you knew he or she could count. When you hired a lawyer, you knew he or she could talk. When you hired a marketing expert, or product developer, what did you know? Nothing. You couldn’t predict what he or she could do, or if he or she could do anything.” Phil Knight founder of Nike. I am looking forward to connecting with my past and present networks. We move at the speed of culture.
