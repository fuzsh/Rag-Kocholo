For the basketball team, see Zamalek SC Basketball. For the volleyball team, see Zamalek SC Volleyball. For the tennis team, see Zamalek SC Table Tennis.\n\nFootball club\n\nZamalek Sporting Club (Arabic: نادي الزمالك للألعاب الرياضية), commonly referred to as Zamalek, is an Egyptian sports club based in Giza, Egypt. The club is best known for its professional men's football team, which plays in the Egyptian Premier League, the top tier of the Egyptian football league system.[6][7] The club is renowned for its consistent success at both domestic and continental levels, regularly contending in CAF tournaments.[8][9]\n\nFounded on 5 January 1911 as Qasr El Nile Club, the club has traditionally worn a white home kit since its inception. The club's name was changed two years later to Cairo International Sports Club (Zamalek),[10] colloquially El Qāhirah El Mokhtalat Club or El Mokhtalat Club. In 1941, the club was granted the honorific title after Farouk I and became officially known as Farouk El Awal Club (transl. Farouk I Club), however, since the 1910s, Zamalek was the club's unofficial name and it became official after the 1952 Egyptian Revolution.[11]\n\nDomestically, Zamalek established itself as one of the two major forces in Egyptian football during the 1920s, as it is the first Egyptian team to ever win a title. Zamalek was the first Egyptian team to win Sultan Hussein Cup in 1921 and 1922, and the first team to win the Egypt Cup in 1922;[12] and the first team to win the Cairo League in 1922–23.[13] In domestic football, the club has won 65 trophies; 14 Egyptian Premier League titles, 28 Egypt Cup titles, 4 Egyptian Super Cup titles, 14 Cairo League titles, 2 Sultan Hussein Cup titles, and a record of one title for each of the October League Cup, Egyptian Friendship Cup and Egyptian Confederation Cup.[14] It is one of two clubs that have played in every season of the Egyptian Premier League, and one of seven that have never been relegated to the Egyptian Second Division.\n\nAt the international level, Zamalek is the most successful football club of the 20th century in Africa (gaining 9 titles versus 7 for their closest rival) and they have won five CAF Champions League titles, two CAF Confederation Cup titles, four CAF Super Cup titles and one African Cup Winners' Cup title. It is also the first Egyptian team ever to win the CAF Super Cup in 1994. Zamalek is also considered the Club of the Afro-Asian Century, Zamalek was the first Egyptian team to participate in and win the Afro-Asian Cup in 1987; and holds the record for most participations (1987, 1994, and 1997) and most titles after winning it a second time in 1997. Zamalek is also the first Egyptian team to ever qualify for the FIFA Club World Cup when they qualified in 2000 to the 2001 championship, despite the cancellation of the championship later on.[15] Zamalek is regularly contending in CAF tournaments and is one of the most successful clubs in Africa.[8]\n\nHistory\n\n[edit]\n\nEarly years (1911–1915)\n\n[edit]\n\nSee also: History of Zamalek SC\n\nLittle is known about the very early years of the club. According to historians,[16][17] the club was established by Belgian lawyer George Merzbach. On 25 December 1910, Merzbach realized that the Cairo Tramways Company's guest house hosting the celebration on the Nile banks was suitable as a sports club headquarters while attending the company's Christmas celebration. Merzbach decided to establish a new club for Belgians, Egyptians, and foreigners. At the time, Gezira Sporting Club, the main sporting club in Cairo, was exclusively for the British Army and unavailable for non-British foreigners and Egyptians. For the new club, he chose the name Qasr El Nile (transl. The Nile Palace). He did not have difficulties in establishing the club, as he enjoyed strong ties within the Palace of Khedive Abbas II, as well as many friendships with senior officials of Egyptian society. He was also the private lawyer for both Baron Empain and the Cairo Tramways Company.\n\nOn 5 January 1911 the club was established, and it was officially opened on 6 February 1911. The first board of directors consisted of Merzbach as president, renowned British archaeologist Howard Carter as vice president, and Noah Amin Abdullah, Ahmed Mahmoud Azzam, Khoury Chalhoub (Lebanese, Representative of the Cairo Tramways Company), and Paolo Esposito (Italian, Representative of the Khedivial Palace) as board members. It was the first club in Cairo to emerge from non-English expatriate communities. They formed sports and social clubs, each with its own identity. An essential aspect of the club was that it was for all people and not for any specific social, economic, or ethnic community. It started out and continued through World War I under Merzbach's presidency.\n\nIn 1913, the club moved to what is currently known as the High Court and changed its name to Cairo International Sports Club (C.I.S.C.), colloquially referred to as the El Qāhirah El Mokhtalat Club or El Mokhtalat Club. The second president of the club was Nicolas Arfagi Bianchi, who played as a left winger for the club's football team.\n\nEgyptianization and unprecedented success (1915–1941)\n\n[edit]\n\nIn 1915, Ibrahim Allam \"Juhainah\" moved to the club with his football team, coming from El Sekka El Hadid SC. Zamalek was the first Egyptian team to play against foreign teams. In 1916, they defeated the Scottish Horse by a score of 1–0.\n\nIn 1917, Zamalek had the legacy of participating as the first and only Egyptian football club in Sultan Hussein Cup, the first official football competition in Egypt.[18] Zamalek played great matches and reached the final match against the English GHQ Signals team, the first champion of the competition. The championship was managed by the Egyptian Ibrahim Allam and was organized under the auspices of the Sultan of Egypt Hussein Kamel. After Zamalek's historic first season, many Egyptian clubs announced their desire to participate in the competition as they found it serious, official, bearing the name of the country's sultan, and includes a trophy for the winning team. Zamalek's team in the 1910s included Tewfik Abdullah, Gamil Osman, Fouad Gamil, Ali El-Hassani, Abdel Salam Hamdy and Ahmed Kholousi.[19]\n\nIn 1917, Ibrahim Allam and the Egyptian members of the club began their revolution to nationalize the club and remove the foreigners from the club's board of directors which mainly consisted of members of the Belgian and French communities. It started with informing the authorities that the club did not have a general assembly for three years, the club records are illegally kept with the club secretary, and have not been legally audited. Allam also put the club under the protection of 17–20 men from Bulaq, to preserve it and protect its Egyptian members. The Ministry of Interior and some foreign embassies in Cairo interfered, but non-Egyptians were not allowed to enter the club. Finally Allam agreed to turn in the club to Mr. Bianchi in the presence of an official force from the police. The Egyptian members realized that it was important to gain a majority at the general members meeting. Accordingly, Allam and the Egyptian members called for an extraordinary general assembly for the club at Al-Shawarby Street.\n\nA decision was made by the general assembly to withdraw confidence from the club's foreign board of directors and elect a new Egyptian board of directors. When the elections were held, the first Egyptian board was elected with Mohammad Badr as president, Mostafa Hassan as treasurer, Ibrahim Allam as General Secretary, and Nicola Arkaji, Mahmoud Bassyouni, Hussein Fawzy, and Abdo El Gabalawy as board members. In 1921, Zamalek won the Sultan Hussein Cup, becoming the first Egyptian team to ever win a title, after its victory over Britain's Sherwood Foresters by a score of 2–1 in the final, the two winning goals were scored by El-Sayed Abaza and Hussein Hegazi.\n\nIn 1922, Zamalek won the first edition of the Egypt Cup and two weeks later won the Sultan Hussein Cup for the second time, after winning Sherwood Foresters in the final by a score of 3–1. Also in 1922, the Cairo League was launched, and Zamalek won its first title in 1922. Besides Hussein Hegazi, the club managed to create a new generation of talented players such as; Ali Riadh, Ibrahim Yakan, El-Sayed Abaza, Mahmoud Marei and Ali El-Hassani. This team won several titles for Zamalek in the 1920s. They defeated the English Stars 3–0 in 1922. On 5 January 1923, Zamalek won the friendly contest against Al Ahly by a score of 5–0, goals scored by Ali Riadh, Hussein Hegazi and Sadek Fahmy (three goals), the first player to score a hat-trick in the Cairo derby.[20]\n\nAfter the first board, a new saif in 1923 was formed with Lieutenant General Mohammed Haidar Pasha as president and Youssef Mohamad as secretary. The new board of directors held its first meeting and decided to continue the fight. They informed the authorities of the missing club records. As a result, no general members' meetings were held for the next few years and later, Mr. Shoudoi, the Belgian club secretary was summoned and agreed to turn in the club records. Mohammed Haider Pasha is the fourth president of Zamalek Sporting Club and the longest serving president in its history and managed the club for almost three decades.\n\nHaider Pasha served as Minister of War in the coalition ministry headed by Hussein Sirri Pasha in 1946, and remained in office until 1952. Haider Pasha remained Commander-in-Chief of the Egyptian Army by royal decree, regardless of successive governments, due to King Farouk's insistence on him remaining in his position. Zamalek's strongman also assumed the presidency of the Egyptian Football Association in 1937 and continued to chair successive boards every two years until 1944. Fouad Serageddin Pasha assumed the presidency of the association and Haidar Pasha returned again as president from 1945 to 1952. During his 29-year career as Zamalek's president, Haidar pasha defended the Zamalek's rights and strengthened the club's position, and gave a political weight to the club with the Royal Family and Egyptian public life. He assured that Zamalek's headquarters stay in El-Balloon Theater area in 1945, when the government wanted to move it to Haram Street, and he insisted that it must stay on the Nile banks as a symbol of giving to the society.\n\nIn the winter of 1924, the club moved to a location on the west bank of the River Nile, and west of Gezira island, and became known as the Cairo International Sports Club (C.I.S.C.)-Zamalek.[21] The 1924 location is occupied by El-Balloon Theater today. Around that time Zamalek received the moniker \"Qahir-al-Aganib\" (the conqueror of foreigners) due to their many victories against renowned foreign teams.[22] In several occasions in Egypt in the 1920s, the team beat foreign teams either in friendly matches or official ones. This increased the popularity of the club and of the sport as a whole in Egypt especially that Egyptian teams such as Zamalek can beat the foreign teams. Zamalek finished as champions in the 1925 King Fouad Cup, for the first time. In 1925, In continuation of their fame as \"Qahir-al-Aganib\" (the conqueror of foreigners), Zamalek played four friendly matches against English clubs and won them all, the club defeated the English Howitzers by a score of 6–0, and the English Kings 2–1, and England's Coast Guards 1–0, and the English Wonders 4–1. In the 1923–24 Sultan Hussein Cup, Zamalek and Al Ahly had never met in the final, however, they played six matches. The first match was in the 1924 Sultan Hussein Cup's semifinal on 17 March 1924, the match finished in a 1–1 draw, in the rematch on 21 March, Zamalek won 2–0 and advanced to the final.\n\nIn 1928, Hussein Hegazi, who is considered the founding father of Egyptian football toured the country's secondary schools to search for new players to join Zamalek, and with those students, Hegazi played against Al Ahly in the 1928 Cairo League and won. The students cheered on Al Ahly, and it was the first time that the name Zamalek was associated with the school's nickname, but the traditional chant was not born yet. Despite this, it was not completed until 1952, when Zamalek sold 20 trees for 1000 Egyptian pounds and gave them to a contractor to build new stands for the Helmy Zamora Stadium, the traditional chant was completed for the first time and it became, \"Oh Zamalek, oh, school of play, art, and engineering\".\n\nOn the occasion of the opening of the club's new headquarters, Zamalek played against the English Army Club on 7 October 1928, and Zamalek won by a score of 1–0, and Zamalek also won on 23 October 1928, one of the British teams with a great score of 14–0. This match witnessed only three players from Zamalek scoring 14 goals, namely Gamal El-Prince, Hussein Hegazy, and El-Sayed Abaza. Zamalek proved that they are \"Qahir-al-Aganib\" (the conqueror of foreigners).\n\nZamalek won two consecutive Cairo League titles in the 1928–29, 1929–30 seasons, the club managed to lead the league with the help of Mohamed Latif, Ismail Rafaat, Hussein Hegazi and Ali El-Hassani. After Zamalek won their second league title in 1929, they played a friendly game against Hungary national football team and Zamalek won 2–1. In the 1929–30 season, Zamalek won their second consecutive league title. In this season Mostafa Taha was Zamalek's new rising star, Taha, who was just 19, in his second season with the club, scored his first goal in the Cairo derby. He moved to Al Ahly for two seasons from 1931 to 1933 before returning to Zamalek in 1933. With Zamalek, he won seven Cairo League titles, five Egypt Cup titles and the King Fouad Cup for one time. He was a great goal scorer and he is Zamalek's all-time top scorer in the Cairo derby with 12 goals, he scored over 100 goals for the team in all competitions. Taha retired as Zamalek's captain in 1945.[23][24]\n\nOne of the unforgettable matches of the 1930s was the 1929–1930 Sultan Hussein Cup semifinal, despite that the two belligerents failed to win this season's title, the match was of a high level of intensity and had much media attention. Zamalek faced Al Ahly in a purely Egyptian contest, in which Zamalek knocked Al Ahly out of the competition, after defeating them in the infamous Cairo derby with a score of 3–1, Zamalek's goals were scored by Mohamed Latif and Mostafa Taha (two goals), while Al Ahly's goal was scored by Mahmoud Mokhtar El Tetsh.[24] In the 1930s, Zamalek achieved several titles, winning the 1931–32 Egypt Cup after defeating their rival, Al Ahly, with a score of 2–1, with goals from Ismail Raafat and Said El-Hadary. After the retirement of Zamalek's veteran striker Hussein Hegazi in 1931, the club bought Ali El-Hassani from Al Ahly for the third and last time, together El-Hassani with Abdulrahman Fawzi who moved to Zamalek in 1934, Mohamed Latif, Sayed Marei, Ibrahim Halim, Ahmed Salem, Ismail El-Samkari, Helmy Zamora, Hassan El Far and Mostafa Taha managed to win the Cairo League title twice in the 1931–32 and 1933–34 seasons, and in the same year, Zamalek won the 1934 King Fouad Cup title for the second time.\n\nIn the 1934–35 Egypt Cup, Zamalek faced Cairo Police in the quarterfinals and won 2–0, played against Al Ittihad in the semifinals and won 3–1, goals scored by Mostafa Taha (two goals) and Sayed Marei. Zamalek won the cup after defeating Al Ahly in the final with a score of 3–0, goals scored by Helmy Zamora, Sayed Marei and Ismail El-Samkari. On December 2, 1938, Hussein Labib scored the winning goal for Zamalek over Al Ahly in the 1938 Egypt Cup final rematch, announcing his team's victory after the two teams tied in the first match with a score of 1-1, Labib also scored his team's winning goal. In the 1939–40 Cairo League, Zamalek met their rivals; Al Ahly in the last match of the league on 29 March 1940 where they won with a score of 4–3, Zamalek goals scored by Galal Keraitam, Abdulrahman Fawzi (two goals) and Hussein Labib, and Hussein Madkour (two goals), Salah Osman scored for Al Ahly. Zamalek won the 1939–40 Cairo League title for their sixth time finishing with 3 points ahead of Al Ahly.\n\nDomestic dominance (1941–1952)\n\n[edit]\n\nZamalek started the 1940s with dominating all the major football tournaments in Egypt, this decade, Zamalek was growing as a sports, social and educational institution. Zamalek won the 1939–40 and 1940–41 Cairo League consecutively and the 1940 King Fouad Cup. With Mohamed Latif still on the pitch and with the help of Tewfik Abdullah, the head coach and Zamalek's forward in the 1920s, the team was unbeatable.\n\nIn the 1940–41 league's season, Zamalek achieved impressive results, they won eight matches out of ten, scoring five goals or more in five matches. Zamalek scored 37 goals and received only 9 goals. On 30 May 1941, Zamalek was supposed to face Al Ahly in the final match of the league, Zamalek was two points ahead of Ahly with goal difference of 28 compared to Ahly's 13, which means that Ahly needed to win with eight goals or more to win the title. Al Ahly withdrew and Zamalek played an exhibition match instead against El Sekka on that day to celebrate the title.\n\nIn 1941, Farouk I, King of Egypt and Sudan, who was himself a fan of Zamalek, bestowed the royal sponsorship on the club, and the club name was renamed to Nady Farouk El Awal (transl. Farouk I Club). Farouk was named the club's honorary president, and Ismail Bek Chirine of Mohammed Ali's family took the post of vice president.[25][26][27]\n\nIn 1944, Haider pasha persuaded King Farouk to watch the Egypt Cup final and he agreed, Farouk is photographed while watching the 1944 Egypt Cup final, while Zamalek won Al Ahly by a score of 6–0. In this period, a new generation of talents emerged in Egypt, the majority were Zamalek players, such as; Yehia Emam, Hanafy Bastan, Omar Shendi, Zoklot, Abdel-Karim Sakr, Halim Thalouth and Mohsen El-Sehaimi. This period witnessed the biggest victories in the history of the Cairo derby (contested with Al Ahly), a pair of 6–0 wins for Zamalek in 1942 Cairo Derby for the 1941–42 Cairo League and 1944 Egypt Cup final. This record scoreline in the Cairo derby has not been broken since.[27]\n\nZamalek won the Cairo League for five times in the 1940s; 1940–41, 1943–44, 1944–45, 1946–47 and 1948–49. Stability in the top management of the club helped to succeed and achieve subsequent titles. Mohammad Haider Pasha was on the head of the Zamalek's administration for nearly three decades. Several football players moved back and forth from Zamalek and Al Ahly, however, each team has its own style and football strategy. Even the team's lineup itself was stable enough for a whole decade.\n\nAbdel-Karim Sakr, who moved from Al Ahly to Zamalek in 1939 in a record transfer, played for Zamalek for 14 seasons, scored over 100 goals for the club. Zamalek's management thought that bringing Sakr to the team would not only help improve the team's attacking ability but also stop him from scoring in Zamalek. Sakr was a prolific goal scorer and helped the team in the 1940s in winning several titles and winning as well the Cairo derby. Sakr is the only player who scored in both matches against Al Ahly that finished by a score of 6–0 for Zamalek in 1941–42 Cairo League and 1944 Egypt Cup final.\n\nIn 1948, the newly formed Egyptian League was launched, Zamalek played against Al Masry in the first match on October 22, and Zamalek won by a score of 5–1. The first goal in the history of the Egyptian League was scored by Zamalek's Mohamed Amin, and the first hat-trick was scored by Zamalek's Saad Rustom.\n\nDespite not finishing the first two seasons in a good position in the league, Zamalek won the Cairo League for three consecutive seasons. In the 1948–49 Cairo League, Zamalek won the league with narrow margin. In the beginning of the 1950s, Zamalek won the Cairo League for three consecutive seasons; 1950–51, 1951–52 and 1952–53, tying with Al Ahly with 14 titles each. Zamalek finished runner-up in the 1950–51 Egyptian League, winning 11 matches and the champions; Al Ahly won 10, with both finishing with 25 points out of 18 matches, Zamalek lost the title to goal difference. In the 1952 Egypt Cup final, Zamalek defeated Al Ahly in the final with a score of 2–0, Sharif El-Far scored the two goals, Zamalek won their 8th title.\n\nPost-1952 period (1952–1960)\n\n[edit]\n\nAfter the 1952 revolution, and on 18 August 1952, the club's president, Mohammed Haidar Pasha, announced the change of the club's name to Zamalek, retrospectively starting July 23, after the area where the club was situated. The club later moved for the last time to 26 July Street, and occupied an area of 35 acres (140,000 m2) and hosted 24 different sports. A new board was formed with Mahmoud Shawky as president and secretary and Mohammad Hassan Helmy as assistant secretary. At the time, the rules required that half the club board be changed every year, and Helmy took the position of secretary-general. In 1954, the stadium needed renovations, so the board sought a businessman to take over the club and guide the renovation. Abd El Hamid El-Shawarbi became the president, and although he was elected for a second period, he was not able to do the job he wanted. Mohammed Haidar Pasha and Hagg Sayed El Annany contributed to forming the VIP stands and the first-class stands, which happened while El Shawarbi was outside Egypt. When he returned, he resigned and the board continued after Shawky stepped up from his deputy position to continue till September 1955.\n\nBusinessman Abdel-Latif Abu-Rajelha became the club president in 1956. By 1956, the rules had been changed allowing the board to stay for three years. Shawky stepped down for Abo Regeila, although he was re-elected as a club president. Although Abu-Rajelha was re-elected for a second term, he had to leave Egypt after he lost money from the governmental policy of nationalization against private property. The club continued to search for another businessman, and chose Alwe El Gazzar, the owner of El Sheikh Sherieb Company and the president of the board of directors of The Coca-Cola Company in Egypt at this time.[28][29][30][31]\n\nEssam Baheeg was arguably Zamalek's most valuable player in the 1950s, and credit for his discovery in particular goes to Mohammed Haidar Pasha, the club's president at the time, as Haider Pasha included him in 1949 in the youth team when he was 18 years old. Quickly, Baheeg was able to secure a distinguished position in the starting lineup for the first team and the Egypt national football team as well, thanks to his talent and skills, and he gradually turned into an icon. Baheeg was known for his extreme loyalty and dedication to Zamalek, which increased his popularity among the club's fans and Egyptian football fans in general. He did not play for any other club throughout his 12-year football career, and is considered a symbol of the club throughout its history. Baheeg was a key player in the Egypt national football team and helped his country lift the African Cup of Nations trophy in 1959 by scoring the two winning goals in the final against Sudan. He became a head coach after retirement, and coached Zamalek in the 1980s for only one season and won four titles with the team.\n\nThis era saw the emergence of a new generation of players who besides their talents as footballers were known with their loyalty for Zamalek such as; Essam Baheeg, Alaa El-Hamouly, Sharif El-Far, Yaken Hussein, Samir Qotb, and Nour El-Dali.\n\nOne of the fiercest Egyptian goal scorers of this era was Alaa El-Hamouly, he won with Zamalek seven titles of the Egypt Cup in his 13 seasons with the team, he is Zamalek's all-time top scorer in the Egypt Cup with 23 goals, he is also Zamalek's 2nd all-time top scorer of the Cairo derby with 9 goals.\n\nIn 1959, Zamalek bought Ali Mohsen, a Yemeni striker, he scored two goals in the 3–2 win over El Olympi in the 1960 Egypt Cup final and was the first non-Egyptian top scorer of the League's 1960–61 season. Zamalek won 6 titles of the Egypt Cup from 1952 to 1960, starting with 1952 through 1955, followed by four consecutive titles in; 1957, 1958 (shared), 1959 and 1960. The club won the Cairo League for 3 consecutive seasons; 1950–51, 1951–52, 1952–53, the tournament was stopped til the final season of 1957–58 and it was defunct permanently.\n\nSustained success (1960–1984)\n\n[edit]\n\nWith the beginning of the 1960s, a new generation emerged in Zamalek and the Egyptian football, such as Ahmed Rifaat, Nabil Nosair, Hamada Emam, Raafat Attia, Abdou Noshi, Aldo Stella, Ahmed Mostafa and Mahmoud Abou-Regaila. This era was one of the first periods in which competitions and conflicts occurred between Zamalek and Al Ahly, due to a number of writers publishing articles that inflamed one party at the expense of the other. Al Ahly was then going through a difficult period in its history, and there were a large number of issues related to corruption that struck the Egyptian sports field, which were embodied by the journalist writer Yusuf Sibai in one of his novels and several articles.\n\nAbu Regeila was an Egyptian businessman and pioneer of public transport buses in Cairo. During his reign, the construction of the Zamalek Stadium was established, as well as the social building continued as the club's official president until 1961. In 1961, Zamalek invited Real Madrid to play a match in Cairo. Hamada Emam was a popular player on the club who helped sustain the club's profile. In 1962, there was a new board came to power with Hassan Amer as a president, emeritus deputy Shawky, Mohamed Latif, Galal Kereitam, Mahmoud Emam, and Mahmoud Hafez. Amer remained as president until the 1967 War.\n\nIn 1966, Zamalek invited West Ham United F.C. to play in Cairo, West Ham were the title holders of the 1964–65 European Cup Winners. Zamalek made a phenomenal match and hammered the European champions with a score of 5–1, at a time when the English club was at the peak of its glory and playing in its ranks were six of the stars of the England national team, headed by Bobby Moore. Hamada Emam scored a hat-trick, Taha Basry and Abdel-Karim El-Gohary scored the other two goals.[32][33][34]\n\nAfter the 1967 war, Zamalek hosted Ismaily SC and Al Masry SC clubs, as well as the other Suez Canal teams at its grounds.[35] In 1967, Minister of Youth and Sports Talaat Khairy decided that the club boards would be appointed rather than elected, and Mohammed Hassan Helmy took over the presidency[36] and was the first Egyptian sportsman to become a president of a club. He remained as president until July 1971 where the rules were changed to allow board elections again and to forbid anyone from being president if they had already held to presidency for two consecutive terms. Tawfeek El Kheshen took over the presidency and the honorary presidency was given to Mohamed Hassan Helmy.\n\nIn 1973, Mohammed Hassan Helmy was re-elected president. Helmy is one of the most famous figures of Zamalek. He joined Zamalek in 1934 as a player in the youth team, he played for 14 years in Zamalek. he won the Cairo League for six times and the Egypt Cup for five times. He was a member of the Egypt national football team. After his retirement, he began his administrative work as a member of the Zamalek Football Committee in 1948, and four years later he was chosen as general secretary of the club in the first general assembly in Zamalek. Then he was appointed full-time director of the club in 1966, in the same year in which he was elected as board member. He held several administrative positions in the Egyptian Football Association, including his presidency of the Competitions Committee and the Technical Committee. In May 1978, he served as president of the Egyptian Football Association. Helmy served as Zamalek's president from 1967 through 1984, except a year in 1971–1972 of El-Kheshen. Helmy also held the position of the president of the Egyptian Football Association. He was primarily credited with establishing most of the facilities of the Zamalek Club. He was famous for his volunteer work, as he refused any pay for his role in the club.\n\nThe 1970s football team was one of the best generations of football in Zamalek, and it included legendary players in the history of Egyptian and Arab football. This era's team included talented players such as Taha Basry, Hassan Shehata, Ali Khalil, Farouk Gaafar, Ibrahim Youssef, Mahmoud Saad and Mahmoud El-Khawaga.[37]\n\nIn the 1975 Egypt Cup final, which Zamalek played against Ghazl El Mahalla, finished in a victory for Zamalek with a score of 1–0, Hassan Shehata scored the winning goal giving his team their 15th title and himself the 1st. Shehata and his colleagues led their team to the 1977–78 Egyptian Premier League title. Hassan Shehata is arguably one of the greatest footballers in Egyptian football history. He is one of the icons of Zamalek throughout its long history. He was called the \"Master\" for his dribbling skills and goals. He was the Egyptian League top scorer for two seasons in 1976–77 and 1979–80, he scored 108 goals for Zamalek. He was included in the Egypt national football team in 1969, where he played his first international match and since then, he was in the starting lineup until his retirement. Besides his honours with the club, Shehata won the EFA Egyptian Player of the Year award in 1976, and was awarded the Order of the Republic (first class) in 1980. Shehata worked as a head coach after his retirement, and as an Egypt's head coach, he won with the Egypt national football team three consecutive African Cup of Nations titles.[38][39] Zamalek were still called \"Qahir-al-Aganib\" (the conqueror of foreigners), despite not playing against foreigners regularly. They met Bayern Munich on 21 December 1977 in a friendly match at the Cairo Stadium, Zamalek succeeded in defeating the Bavarians with a score of 3–2, and goals scorers were Waheed Kamel, Mohamed Taher, and Ali Khalil.[40][41]\n\nIn the 1970s, several Zamalek players were football stars who can simply lead a team by themselves such as; Ali Khalil, who started his football career in Zamalek's youth team in 1969, and played for the first team in 1971. Khalil spent his whole career with Zamalek. He was an outstanding goal scorer who scored 94 goals for Zamalek in 9 seasons. Khalil was one of Egypt's most popular players of the 1970s.

Zamalek's goals were scored by Farouk Gaafar and Ali Khalil (two goals), Khalil was the cup's top scorer with 4 goals. He also scored in both in the 1979 Egypt Cup final. Nicknamed \"Dangerous Ali\", Khalil was the Egyptian Premier League's top scorer in 1976-77 and 1979–80 seasons.[42] In the 1978–79 league season, Khalil had a famous incident of honesty and high integrity, when he scored an incorrect goal after he shot the ball which passed through the torn outer net and landed in the goal against Ismaily in a famous match. Unfortunately, this goal was important for Zamalek in the chase for the league title, however he encountered the referee Ahmed Bilal, the referee of the match, and told him that the ball was not a goal, and the goal was canceled after it had been awarded amid major objections from the Ismaily players and fans.[43][44]\n\nIn the same generation, the midfielder Farouk Gaafar also started his youth career in Zamalek and spent his whole career with the club, was a rising star in the 1970s.[45] He was a talented player with intelligence and incredible football skills that made him a great player in the squad and in the Egyptian national football team.[46][47] Nicknamed the \"King of Midfield\", Gaafar was the first captain to lift the African Cup of Champions Clubs in 1984.[48][49]\n\nIn the same era Taha Basry, the Egyptian \"Eusebio\", as media and audiences used to call him, who played in the 1960s, and after a spell in Kuwait, returned to Zamalek in 1974 to become the captain of the team that won the league title in 1977–78 season and the cup title twice in 1975 and 1977.[50][51]\n\nZamalek won the Egypt Cup for another two times in the 1970s, in 1977 and 1979. Besides the Egyptian Premier League trophy in the 1959–60 season. Zamalek won the Egyptian Premier League in 1963–64, 1964–65, 1977–78, and 1983–84.

In 1995, four members in the board were removed due to their six absences from board meetings: Mahmoud Marouf, Mohamad Fayez El Zummur, and Amer. They were replaced with Mortada Mansour, Mahmoud Abdallah, Mounnir Hassan, and Ibrahim Latif. The high committee for youth and sports objected on linking the appointed members with the elected ones, Hassan and Ibrahim Latif forfeited their positions. The newly two appointed members for the club board were Amer and El Nasr in support of their abilities and dedication. Fawzy was selected to be treasurer till the new elections.\n\nOn 4 July, Abd El Menem Emarah decided to release the club board and the Egyptian Football Association board after the game between Al-Ahly and Zamalek in 1995–96, and the board froze football activities in the club. A one-year temporary club board was selected with Kamal Darwish as president, Abdel Aziz Kabil as vice president, and board members Hanafy Reyad, Magdy Sharaf, Ismail Selim, Azmy Megahed, and Mohamad Abd El Rahman Fawzy.

The football team only won two titles in this period; the Egypt Cup in 2007–08 and 2012–13.\n\nShikabala. Zamalek's winger, is one of the most prominent talents in the history of Egyptian football, who carried the banner of Zamalek and preserved the popularity of Zamalek in that difficult period. The level of Zamalek continued to decline, and its administration destabilized since Mortada Mansour assumed the presidency of the club in 2005.\n\nThe council did not last long and was dissolved, and a council headed by Morsi Atallah came to run the club before Mansour returned to head the council. Mansour dissolved the board of directors before restoring it, and the National Sports Council intervened to appoint a council headed by Muhammad Amir for a year before elections were held in May 2009, which resulted in the election of Mamdouh Abbas as the club's president; Abbas' council was dissolved in 2010 after Mansour obtained a court ruling stating that the elections were rigged. The administrative authority appointed an interim council to manage the club headed by Galal Ibrahim, before Abbas' council returned when Mansour abandoned his lawsuit. Taher Abu Zaid disbanded Abbas' council, and formed an interim council headed by Kamal Darwish to head Zamalek, but by appointment.[61]\n\nReconstruction and reform\n\n[edit]\n\nMortada Mansour's era and beyond (2014–2020; 2021–2023)\n\n[edit]\n\nIn 2014, Mortada Mansour took over the club.

On August 19, 2023, the Board of Directors of Zamalek submitted a collective resignation following the administration's failure to solve the club's crises and debts. This failure resulted in a ban on registering players, an inability to win most of the games and championships, and the cessation of work at the club's branch in 6th of October City. The Youth and Sports Directorate appointed Hassan Moussa as executive management of the Zamalek Club, Ahmed Fouad Al-Watan as financial director, and Ayman Abdel Moneim as director of sports activities.
