        "text": "The narratives of the (ongoing) Palestinian Nakba possess significant historical, cultural, literary, and academic value. Preserving this content and empowring it with AI tools is crucial for ensuring its accessibility and usability for present and future generations. Nakba narratives and testimonies exist in diverse formats such as manuscripts, books, audio recordings, novels, and films. Converting this content into a machine-understandable format presents a notable challenge. Establishing accessible archives and well-annotated collections is essential for researchers and historians to verify and share meaningful information.\n\nThis workshop aims to explore how artificial intelligence, natural language processing, and corpus linguistics can assist in understanding, disseminating and preserving, Nakba narratives and testimonies. The goal is to create accessible, comprehensive, and well-annotated collections that empower researchers and historians to validate and share critical insights derived from these data. The workshop targets datasets and narratives in Arabic, English, and other languages, however, submitted articles should be written in English.\n\nAll submitted papers must clearly state and explain their relevance to the topic of ‘Nakba Narratives as Language Resources’. The organisers reserve the right to reject any papers that incite hatred, refute established facts, or undermine the suffering of individuals.\n\nSubmissions may be of two types:\n\nLong papers – up to eight (8) pages maximum, presenting substantial, original, completed, and unpublished work.\n\nShort papers – up to four (4) pages, describing a small focused contribution, negative results, system demonstrations, etc."
