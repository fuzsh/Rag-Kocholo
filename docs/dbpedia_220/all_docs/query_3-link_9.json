        "text": "Al-Malik al-Mansur\n\nAl-Mansur Salah ad-Din Muhammad ibn Hajji ibn Muhammad ibn Qalawun (1347/48–1398), better known as al-Mansur Muhammad, was the Mamluk sultan in 1361–1363. He ruled in name only, with power held by the Mamluk magnates, particularly Yalbugha al-Umari, al-Mansur Muhammad's regent. The latter had al-Manur Muhammad's predecessor and uncle an-Nasir Hasan killed and al-Mansur Muhammad installed to replace him.\n\nBiography\n\n[edit]\n\nAl-Mansur Muhammad was the son of Sultan al-Muzaffar Hajji (r. 1346–1347).[1] Following the murder of his uncle, Sultan an-Nasir Hasan (r. 1354–1361), by Emir Yalbugha al-Umari in 1361, the latter and the other senior emirs or magnates selected al-Mansur Muhammad,[2] then an adolescent,[3] as an-Nasir Hasan's successor.[2] His kingmakers consisted of eight emirs, chief among whom were emirs Yalbugha and Taybugha al-Tawil.[2] Their decision to appoint al-Mansur Muhammad, a grandson Sultan an-Nasir Muhammad (r. 1310–1341), ended the tradition of installing sons of an-Nasir Muhammad as sultans.[2] They chose al-Mansur Muhammad instead of an-Nasir Muhammad's last surviving son, al-Amjad Husayn, because they believed al-Mansur Muhammad would be easier to control.[2] In the new order, Yalbugha was the most powerful of the senior emirs, although he ruled mostly in concert with Taybugha.[2]\n\nIn early 1363, Yalbugha and Taybugha had al-Mansur Muhammad deposed based on allegations of the sultan's illicit behavior.[3] They chose his cousin, al-Ashraf Sha'ban, the ten-year-old son of al-Amjad Husayn, as al-Mansur Muhammad's successor, in the belief that he would be easier to dominate.[3] Al-Mansur Muhammad died in 1398 and was buried in the mausoleum of his paternal grandmother (wife of al-Muzaffar Hajji) in Rawda Island.[4] He had ten children.[4]\n\nReferences\n\n[edit]\n\nBibliography\n\n[edit]"
