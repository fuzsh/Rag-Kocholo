Afterwards, Zulfikar volunteered in the Battle of Ismailia of 1952, and in the 1956 Suez War.

His courage as a veteran national hero during his service as a policeman earned him a respectable reputation through the whole militarized spectrum.[42]\n\nIn the Cairo Citadel, a big photo of Salah Zulfikar and his colleagues stands in the police museum, in honor of the heroes of the 1952 battle of Ismailia against the British.
