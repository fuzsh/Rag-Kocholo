        "text": "Australian expatriate jurist Geoffrey Robertson, who had been representing some of the Magnitsky campaigners, described the Act as \"one of the most important new developments in human rights.\" He added that it provides \"a way of getting at the Auschwitz train drivers, the apparatchiks, the people who make a little bit of money from human rights abuses and generally keep under the radar.\"[59]\n\nState Duma deputy Yevgeny Fedorov argued that the real purpose of the Magnitsky bill was to manipulate key figures in big business and government, with the aim of pro-American policy in the Russian Federation.[60]\n\nIn 2018, the British parliament passed a so-called ‘Magnitsky amendment’ to the Sanctions and Anti-Money Laundering Act to give the government the power to impose sanctions on people who commit gross human rights violations.[61]\n\nBill Van Auken of the World Socialist Web Site condemned the United States for what he described as invoking human rights as a cover for realpolitik in the Magnitsky Act, stating that Washington DC officials had supported \"far greater crimes, [such] as when Boris Yeltsin in 1993 ordered the bombardment of the Russian White House, the seat of the country’s parliament, killing 62 people\".[62][63]\n\nThe controversial 2016 Russian documentary The Magnitsky Act – Behind the Scenes presents a falsified[64] view of Magnitsky, asserting that \"Magnitsky was not beaten while in police custody, and that he did not make any specific allegations against individuals in his testimony to Russian authorities\".[65] In its review of the controversial documentary, The Guardian includes views of those sceptical of the documentary such as Petras Auštrevičius, Lithuanian member of the European Parliament who also serves on the Foreign Affairs Committee, who said the push to screen the film was one of several moves by the Russian authorities to weaken western confidence in its policy line and secure a review of European Union sanctions against Russia later that year.[65]\n\nIn a July 2017 interview on CNN's Fareed Zakaria GPS, Bill Browder discussed the Magnitsky Act and topics such as the reasons why Putin is directly threatened by it, the money given by the Russian government to more than 10,000 Russian human-rights abusers, the June 2016 Trump Tower meeting, and the power and influence of Russian money in Washington, D.C. at the time.[66]\n\nLiberal Russian dissidents Vladimir V. Kara-Murza and Boris Nemtsov both approved of the act, calling it \"pro-Russian.\"[67][68]\n\nPassage\n\nedit\n\nIn 2016, Congress enacted the Global Magnitsky Human Rights Accountability Act, which allows the U.S. government to sanction foreign government officials implicated in human rights abuses anywhere in the world.[74]\n\nInitially introduced as separate legislation by Senator Benjamin Cardin (D-MD) in the Senate[75] and Representative Chris Smith (R-NJ) in the House,[76] the Global Magnitsky Act was ultimately incorporated as Title XII, Subtitle F (sections 1261 through 1265) of the omnibus National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2017 (NDAA FY 2017), which became law on December 23, 2016.[77]\n\nLegal framework\n\nedit\n\nThe legal framework for the Global Magnitsky Sanctions consists of the following executive order, multiple public laws (statutes), and regulations:[78]\n\nExecutive Order\n\nExecutive Order 13818\n\nStatutes\n\nGlobal Magnitsky Human Rights Accountability Act, 22 U.S.C.§§2656 note\n\nInternational Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA), 50 U.S.C.§§1701-1706\n\nCode of Federal Regulations\n\nGlobal Magnitsky Sanctions Regulations, 31 CFR Part 583\n\nSanctions imposed through EO 13818\n\nedit\n\nEffective 21 December 2017, U.S. President Donald Trump issued Executive Order 13818, the first implementation of the Global Magnitsky Human Rights Accountability Act, under which the U.S. government imposed sanctions against 13 individuals described as \"human rights abusers, kleptocrats, and corrupt actors.\"[79][80] The decision was announced by US Secretary of the Treasury Steven Mnuchin.[79] President Trump said that he was \"declaring a national emergency with respect to serious human-rights abuse and corruption around the world.\"[81] The sanctioned individuals included Yahya Jammeh, former president of The Gambia, and Roberto Jose Rivas Reyes, president of Nicaragua's Supreme Electoral Council.[27] An additional 39 affiliated companies and individuals were also sanctioned by the Treasury Department's Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC).[27]\n\nDan Gertler\n\nedit\n\nAccording to The Economist, Dan Gertler, an \"Israeli mining billionaire\" and longtime close friend of Joseph Kabila, who was President of the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) for decades, was also listed in President Trump's EO Annex and placed on the OFAC financial sanctions list.[82] All of Gertler's assets that were under U.S. jurisdiction were blocked.[80] According to a February 2018 article in The Economist, the sanctions statement said that Gertler had \"amassed his fortune through hundreds of millions of dollars' worth of opaque and corrupt mining and oil deals\" in the DRC.[83] Included in the Executive Order is the list of designated entities \"affiliated with\" Gertler:[84]\n\nAfrican Trans International Holdings B.V.\n\nAlmerina Properties Limited\n\nFleurette Africa Resources I B.V.\n\nFleurette African Transport B.V.\n\nFleurette Energy I B.V.\n\nInterlog DRC\n\nIron Mountain Enterprises Limited\n\nKaribu Africa Services SA\n\nKitoko Food Farm\n\nMoku Goldmines AG\n\nMoku Mines D'or SA\n\nOriental Iron Company SPRL\n\nSanzetta Investments Limited\n\nVentora Development Sasu.\n\nIn a November 28, 2019, article in The Economist, it was reported that President Trump's decision to place sanctions on Gertler, who is a close friend of then-President of the Congo, Joseph Kabila, had come as \"a shock to many companies operating in the Congo.\" Citing Tom Perriello, who was then the United States envoy to the African Great Lakes under Barack Obama, the sanctions \"probably helped push Mr. Kabila to his eventual decision to stand down in the elections that took place a year later,\" in the December 2018 general election.[81]\n\n2018\n\nedit\n\nIn June 2018, Félix Bautista, a member of the Senate of the Dominican Republic and five companies owned or controlled by him were sanctioned by the U.S. Department of Treasury under the Global Magnitsky Act due to his involvement in significant corruption. Bautista has reportedly engaged in bribery in relation to his position as a Senator, and is alleged to have engaged in corruption in Haiti, where he used his connections to win public works contracts to help rebuild Haiti following several natural disasters, including one case where his company was paid over $10 million for work not completed.[85]\n\nIn July 2018, three Nicaraguans were added to the OFAC sanctions list. Nicaraguan National Police Commissioner Francisco Javier Diaz Madriz (Diaz) and Secretary of the Mayor's Office of Managua Fidel Antonio Moreno Briones (Moreno) were sanctioned for being responsible for, or the leaders of entities involved in, serious human rights abuse in Nicaragua. Additionally, OFAC designated Jose Francisco Lopez Centeno (Lopez), the Vice President of ALBA de Nicaragua (ALBANISA) and President of Petronic, for engaging in corrupt activities.[31]\n\nIn August 2018, the Treasury Department sanctioned top Turkish government officials, Turkish Justice Minister Abdulhamit Gül and Interior Minister Süleyman Soylu, who were involved in the detention of American pastor Andrew Brunson.[86] Daniel Glaser, the former Assistant Secretary for Terrorist Financing under President Barack Obama, said: \"It’s certainly the first time I can think of\" the U.S. sanctioning a NATO ally. \"I certainly regard it as a human rights violation to unlawfully detain somebody, so I think it falls within the scope of the Global Magnitsky Act.\"[87]\n\nIn November 2018, the Treasury Department announced the imposition of Global Magnitsky Act sanctions against 17 Saudi Arabian officials who \"targeted and brutally killed\" Saudi dissident journalist Jamal Khashoggi, who lived and worked in the United States.[30]\n\n2020\n\nedit\n\nOn July 9, 2020, the U.S. Department of the Treasury's Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) sanctioned a Chinese government entity (the Xinjiang Public Security Bureau) and four current or former government officials for serious rights abuses against ethnic minorities in the Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region (XUAR).[88] The sanctions were imposed on the basis of serious human rights abuses which reportedly included mass arbitrary detention and severe physical abuse, among other serious abuses targeting Uyghurs (the Turkic Muslim population indigenous to Xinjiang) and other ethnic minorities in the region.[88]\n\nThe four sanctioned individuals were:[88]\n\nChen Quanguo, Communist Party Secretary of XUAR and former Communist Party Secretary of Tibet (Tibet Autonomous Region)\n\nZhu Hailun, former Deputy Party Secretary of the XUAR\n\nWang Mingshan, incumbent Communist Party Secretary of the Xinjiang Public Security Bureau (XPSB)\n\nHuo Liujun (霍留军), former Communist Party Secretary of the XPSB\n\nOn July 31, 2020, the OFAC further sanctioned Xinjiang Production and Construction Corps (XPCC), Sun Jinlong, a former Political Commissar of the XPCC, and Peng Jiarui, the Deputy Party Secretary and Commander of the XPCC, for their connection to similar human rights abuses against the ethnic minorities in XUAR.[89]\n\nThe XPCC is a paramilitary organization in the XUAR subordinate to the Chinese Communist Party (CCP), created to enhance internal control over the region.[89] XPCC was used by XUAR CCP Secretary Chen Quanguo, who was subject to similar sanctions on July 9, 2020, to implement a comprehensive surveillance, detention, and indoctrination program targeting Uyghurs and other ethnic minority groups.[89] The sanction generally prohibits all transactions by U.S. persons or taking place within the United States involving any property or interests in property of the sanctioned entities. The sanctions are listed by the OFAC as part of \"an ongoing effort to deter human rights abuses in the Xinjiang region.\"[89]\n\n2021\n\nedit\n\nFilipos Woldeyohannes, Chief of staff of the Eritrean Defence Forces (EDF), was sanctioned under the Magnitsky Act on August 23, 2021, for his command responsibility as head of the EDF, involved in war crimes and sexual violence in the Tigray War.[90]\n\nIn Paraguay, Kassem Mohamad Hijazi, Khalil Ahmad Hijazi and Liz Paola Doldan, despachantes (dispatchers) operating in the tri-border area of Brazil, Paraguay and Argentina, and whose money laundering operation was estimated to have amassed hundreds of millions of dollars, were also sanctioned by the act.[91]\n\nSanctions imposed through EO 13936\n\nedit\n\nOn August 7, 2020, the U.S. Department of Treasury sanctioned 11 individuals \"for undermining Hong Kong's autonomy and restricting the freedom of expression or assembly of the citizens of Hong Kong.\"[92]\n\nThese sanctions were made pursuant to Executive Order (E.O.) 13936, which was issued on July 14, 2020, by President Trump to declare a national emergency with respect to the situation in Hong Kong, where actions by China \"fundamentally undermine Hong Kong's autonomy and democratic processes.\"[92]\n\nThe sanctioned individuals are:[92]\n\nCarrie Lam, Chief Executive of Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (HKSAR)\n\nChris Tang, Commissioner of Hong Kong Police Force (HKPF)\n\nEric Chan, Secretary General, Committee for Safeguarding National Security of the HKSAR\n\nErick Tsang, HKSAR Secretary for Constitutional and Mainland Affairs\n\nJohn Lee Ka-chiu, HKSAR Secretary for Security\n\nLuo Huining, Director of the Hong Kong Liaison Office\n\nStephen Lo, former Commissioner of HKPF\n\nTeresa Cheng, HKSAR Secretary for Justice\n\nXia Baolong, Director of the Hong Kong and Macao Affairs Office of the State Council\n\nZhang Xiaoming, deputy director of the Hong Kong and Macao Affairs Office of the State Council\n\nZheng Yanxiong, Director, Office for Safeguarding National Security in Hong Kong\n\nCalls for additional sanctions\n\nedit\n\nIn September 2017, a group of NGOs and anti-corruption organizations identified 15 international cases where alleged crimes were committed. Individuals from countries, including Azerbaijan, Bahrain, China, the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Egypt, Ethiopia, Liberia, Mexico, Panama, Russia, Saudi Arabia, Tajikistan, Ukraine, Uzbekistan, and Vietnam, were nominated for sanctions.[93]\n\nIn December 2017, Americans for Democracy & Human Rights in Bahrain stated that,\n\nThe Trump Administration has failed to take up cases presented regarding serious human rights abuses committed by Bahraini government officials. Ultimately, there were no individuals or entities from any Arab League member state designated in the Global Magnitsky Act’s first list of designees, despite the submission of eligible cases.[94]\n\nIn August 2018, Senator Marco Rubio and a bipartisan group of 16 other members of Congress urged the United States to impose sanctions under the Global Magnitsky Act against Chinese officials responsible for human rights abuses against the Uyghur Muslim minority in Xinjiang.[95] In December 2019, the Uyghur Human Rights Policy Act was passed in the House of Representatives, which calls for the imposition of sanctions under the Global Magnitsky Act.[96] The 2019 annual report of the Congressional-Executive Commission on China called for Congress to consider sanctions against Chinese officials under the Global Magnitsky Act for crimes against humanity.[97][98]\n\nOn April 7, 2020, Rep. Chris Smith, called on Secretary of State Mike Pompeo to form a task force \"to identify and investigate\" Chinese government officials for their role in allegedly silencing doctors and journalists who have spoken out about China's response to the COVID-19 pandemic. Further, Smith suggested that the U.S. apply the Global Magnitsky Act to target specific Chinese officials involved in going after whistleblowers, without punishing the country as a whole.[99]\n\nOn December 15, 2021, 18 United States senators co-signed a letter to U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken and U.S. Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen, asking them to sanction the NSO Group under the Magnitsky Act, due to the Israeli firm's controversy regarding its Pegasus smartphone spyware product.[100]"
