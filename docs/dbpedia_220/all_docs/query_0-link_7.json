Wikis (from wikiwiki, meaning “fast” in Hawaiian) are a promising new technology that supports “conversational” knowledge creation and sharing. A Wiki is a collaboratively created and iteratively improved set of web pages, together with the software that manages the web pages. Because of their unique way of creating and managing knowledge, Wikis combine the best elements of earlier conversational knowledge management technologies, while avoiding many of their disadvantages. This article introduces Wiki technology, the behavioral and organizational implications of Wiki use, and Wiki applicability as groupware and help system software. The article concludes that organizations willing to embrace the “Wiki way” with collaborative, conversational knowledge management systems, may enjoy better than linear knowledge growth while being able to satisfy ad-hoc, distributed knowledge needs.",

        "text": "Wikis for Collaboration & Knowledge Management: Current Practices & Future Directions\n\nC. Kussmaul\n\nBusiness, Computer Science\n\nThe flexibility of wikis is emphasized, including the ease with which they can be used to prototype and refine user interfaces for KM tasks and activities, and the future directions and implications in these rapidly changing areas are discussed.\n\nImplementing Wikis in Knowledge and Information Centers: An Overview\n\nDr. S. K. JenaDr. K. C. Das\n\nComputer Science, Education\n\nThis paper explores how wikis can be implemented in knowledge and information centres to manage knowledge and why they should be used in this environment with some examples of wikis as both private and public knowledge repositories and as collaborative workspaces.\n\nWikis in the workplace: how Wikis can help manage knowledge in library reference services\n\nAngela Kille\n\nEducation, Computer Science\n\nLibrary and Information Science Research E…\n\nA wiki can be used in multiple ways as a conversational knowledge management system to support the goals of many organizations, including libraries.\n\nIncreasing collaborative knowledge management in your organization: characteristics of wiki technology and wiki users\n\nAndrea J. Hester\n\nBusiness, Computer Science\n\nSIGMIS-CPR '10\n\nCharacteristics of Wiki technology and wiki users are examined in an effort to uncover factors facilitating increased adoption and usage ofWiki technology as a collaborative knowledge management tool.\n\nSupporting Knowledge Creation – Using Wikis for Group Collaboration\n\nKate WatsonC. Harper\n\nComputer Science, Education\n\nHow wiki technology enables the online collaborative process is discussed, particularly in corporations, institutions, libraries, and by researchers for the purpose of supporting knowledge creation through collaborative group work.\n\nWikis for collaboration and knowledge management: Current practices and future directions\n\nC. Kussmaul\n\nBusiness, Computer Science\n\nThis chapter examines how collaboration and knowledge management (KM) can be supported using wikis and related tools and identifies associated challenges and best practices.\n\nEmploying Wiki for knowledge management as a collaborative information repository: an NBC universal case\n\nDanielle BibboJames MichelichEric SpreheYoung Eun Lee\n\nComputer Science, Business\n\nThis case study presents the inception of a wiki by the NBC Universal Software Engineering and Delivery Team and the expansion of the wiki to other departments in the firm, in particular to Peacock Productions, which specializes in programming of documentary TV programs, demonstrating that Wiki can be a powerful tool for managing knowledge in business corporations, which must adapt quickly to changing market demands.\n\nWikis as tools for collaboration\n\nJ. Klobas\n\nComputer Science\n\nThis article introduces wikis, jointly edited Web sites and Intranet resources that are accessed through web browsers, and explains wiki technology and philosophy, and provides an overview of how wikis are being used for collaboration, and considers some of the issues associated with management of wikis.\n\nWiki-based community collaboration in organizations\n\nOsama MansourMustafa A. AbusalahLinda Askenäs\n\nBusiness, Computer Science\n\nIt is shown that the openness of the wiki has a dual impact on wiki collaboration and also discusses how the wiki might serve as both an enabler and inhibitor for community and knowledge collaboration.\n\nNew work spaces: wikis for cataloging collaborations\n\nK. Minčić-Obradović\n\nEducation, Computer Science\n\nThe paper seeks to describe how tools like wikis can be used to improve collaboration and communication in project‐based teams and general work groups and proves to be very efficient project management and knowledge management systems.\n\nEnhancing E‐government in Developing Countries: Managing Knowledge through Virtual Communities\n\nC. WagnerKaren S. K. CheungFion S. L. LeeR. Ip\n\nComputer Science, Political Science\n\nIt is suggested that knowledge management is needed to facilitate information exchange and transaction processing with citizens, as well as to enable inter‐government knowledge sharing and integration and simple knowledge management solutions will be the most appropriate for developing countries, while enterprise solutions are not suitable.\n\nCollaboration Engineering with ThinkLets to Pursue Sustained Success with Group Support Systems\n\nR. BriggsG. VreedeJ. Nunamaker\n\nEngineering, Computer Science\n\nThe thinkLet concept is proposed, a codified packet of facilitation skill that can be applied by practitioners to achieve predictable, repeatable patterns of collaboration, such as divergence or convergence, which may become a sine qua non for organizations to effectively support virtual work teams.\n\nEnd Users as Expert System Developers?\n\nC. Wagner\n\nComputer Science\n\nDifficulties associated with end user development, both in terms of design quality and knowledge content are discussed, as end users may have a performance advantage in using their knowledge, but not in knowing it.\n\nThe Development of Successful On-Line Communities\n\nChristian Wagner\n\nComputer Science, Sociology\n\nThe main design criteria underlying successful communities is examined, and principles for the design of successful communities are identified, based on a review of the literature, and the study of several communities.\n\nCase Study GROUP SUPPORT SYSTEMS IN HONG KONG: An Action Research Project\n\nRobert DavisonDoug Vogel\n\nBusiness\n\nA variety of lessons concerning the use of GSS are presented while increased use of action research in complex organisational contexts is recommended.\n\nUnderstanding Open Source Software Evolution: Applying, Breaking, and Rethinking the Laws of Software Evolution\n\nW. Scacchi\n\nComputer Science\n\nFinding conformance would be reassuring to the current outstanding effort representing decades of study, whereas finding breakdowns, inconsistencies, or failures might point to refutations of the laws/theory, or at least the need to rethink, refine, and reformulate the laws to account for the evolution of F/OSS.\n\nSubject gateway sites and search engine ranking\n\nM. Thelwall\n\nComputer Science\n\nIt is shown that under certain stated assumptions gateway sites can actually decrease the PageRank of their targets, and suggestions are made for gateway site designers and other Web authors to minimise this.\n\nUsing a GDSS to Facilitate Group Consensus: Some Intended and Unintended Consequences\n\nRichard T. WatsonG. DeSanctisM. S. Poole\n\nComputer Science\n\nMIS Q.\n\nIn a task requiring resolution of competing personal preferences, 82 groups - the largest sample size in the GDSS literature to date - were randomly assigned to one of three experiment conditions: a computer-based support system (GDSS), a manual, paper and pencil, support system; or no support whatsoever.\n\nTwo case studies of open source software development: Apache and Mozilla\n\nA. MockusR. FieldingJ. Herbsleb\n\nComputer Science\n\nTSEM\n\nThis work examines data from two major open source projects, the Apache web server and the Mozilla browser, and quantifies aspects of developer participation, core team size, code ownership, productivity, defect density, and problem resolution intervals for these OSS projects.\n\nBuilding expert systems\n\nF. Hayes-Roth\n\nComputer Science\n\nAdvanced book program\n\nThis book provides a broad introduction to the concepts and methods necessary for an understanding of how these systems work."
