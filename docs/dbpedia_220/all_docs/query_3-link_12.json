Lonely and dreaming of a son and worthy advisor-successor, he falls in love with his servant Firdaws (Hoda Sultan), who bears him a son named Hamada. Hajji keeps threatening to bequeath his wealth to the golden boy Hamada, but the enraged Khalil incites Khamis to poison Hajj’s food with arsenic and frame Firdaws, succeeding on both counts with Hamada in their clutches and Firdaws imprisoned for twenty years.\n\nKhalil orders Khamis to take Hamada to Cairo and abandon him in the crowd. In the Al-Hussain neighborhood, Khamis leaves Hamada but watches him cautiously, until a teacher named Younes al-Saftawi (Salah Mansour) finds him and takes him home to the Al-Jamaliah neighborhood. Quickly realizing that Hamada has no family with good intentions remaining, al-Saftawi takes him to an orphanage and pledges to visit regularly.\n\nHamada (Mohamed Tharwat) grows up in the orphanage and joins its Conservatory, where he excels at music and falls in love with his colleague Souad (Mona Gabr), while Khalil and Khamis squander their wealth on wine, women, and gambling as the tannery’s debts mount. They are ultimately forced to sell the business to pay down the debts, and the buyer is none other than Tafaida al-Halawani, Hajji's cousin and Souad's mother. Khlail ends up paralyzed and begging in front of Alexandria's Abu al-Abbas al-Mursi Mosque, while Khamis makes a living as a squeegee man and panhandling on the streets. Firdaws is released after 15 years in prison, but she is rejected by Tafaida and therefore stays with a friend (Ragaa Youssef). Inquiring about her son's whereabouts, she hears from Khamis that he is with Younes, who is on Hajj. Hamada asks Tafaida for her daughter Souad's hand in marriage, but she refuses, so Hamada summons Younes to advocate on his behalf. Firdaws encounters Younes on return from Hajj, and he leads her to Hamada's graduation party at the Conservatory, at which she reunites with her son and meets Tafaida and Souad; Hamada, who just prior got a note from Younes not to seek him again, is overjoyed at the reunion.\n\nProduction\n\n[edit]\n\nActor Salah Mansour died during filming on January 19, 1979, requiring director Hassan al-Imam to edit down his role in the film. Mansour was admitted to the hospital in the Agouza neighborhood of Cairo and spent his last days beside his wife and his eldest son Majdi. According to her, his last words were \"Do not cry, for I have lived my life and hate to see tears in your eyes, which I will not be able to behold after I die\". He was 56, and his widow was granted an unusually large pension, given their modest means, by President Anwar Sadat.[3]\n\nReception\n\n[edit]\n\nMahmoud Kassem argued in his 2018 book الفيلم الغنائي في السينما المصرية (The Musical Film in Egyptian Cinema) that:\n\nEbn meen fel mogtamaa marked a turning point in Egyptian film musicals, in which director Hassan al-Imam tried to launch a new generation of singers to replace the late Abdel Halim Hafez [who died in 1979]. Mohamed Tharwat, in his film debut, seemed a promising candidate to relaunch al-Imam’s formula in a modern context. However, the film was a box-office disappointment, and Tharwat soon left the silver screen for television.\n\nNevertheless, songs from the score like \"يا اللي مالوش غيرك حما\" (“Oh, Hama, I Have No Protection But You”) were popular.[4]\n\nReferences\n\n[edit]"
