        "text": "Here are few tips for behavioral science that can tap into emotions of your consumers: Authority bias: the tendency to give weight to a source of information because of its perceived expertise. Authority bias can be expressed by quoting endorsements and sponsorships, assuming a brand can legitimately cite either of these factors in their ad copies.\n\nYou can always test different placements for your site buttons and pages, or even test different colors. Some tools like Hubspot or Optimizely, can help you test these parameters and find what works best for your business and your customers. A tool like Goolge analytics is very simple to use and straight forward in identifying low performing pages based on many factors: - Page with low session time - Page with high bounce rates - Looking at heat maps to find the weakest points of your pages to work on fixing them. Once you have identified these issues, remember that you need separate strategy for each category, and don't try to fix everything all at once.\n\n36% of consumers in US have used visual search when shopping online and 50% of the consumers said that visual assets are more important than text when searching for information. So you have to consider it for both advertising and organic optimization too. Wondering Why? - Increasing User Preference for Visual Content - Advancements in Image Recognition Technology - Integration of Visual Search in E-commerce\n\nIn Google Ads, you can create compelling video campaigns with a range of video ad formats to engage customers in different ways on YouTube and across video partner sites. Available video ad formats include: - Skippable in-stream ads - Non-skippable in-stream ads - In-feed video ads - Bumper ads - Outstream ads - Masthead ads In-feed ads would show on YouTube search, which is the 2nd largest search engine! You can use in-feed video ads to promote video content in places of discovery, including next to related YouTube videos, as part of a YouTube search result, or on the YouTube mobile homepage. The best thing that you’ll be charged only when viewers choose to watch your ad by clicking the thumbnail.\n\nStart by defining your desired KPIs. Are you aiming for more conversions (sales, leads), website visits, or brand awareness? Instead of bidding on clicks, prioritize bidding strategies that optimize for profitable actions: * Target CPA (cost-per-acquisition): Set a maximum cost you're willing to pay for a conversion, ensuring efficient spending. * Maximize Conversions: Google Ads automatically adjusts bids to get you the most conversions within your budget. Once you choose the strategy, fine-tune bids for individual keywords based on their performance so you now what and what not to bid for."
