        "text": "Salih I ibn Mansur (Arabic: صالح ابن منصور الأول) was the founder of the Kingdom of Nekor, located in the Rif Mountains of Morocco. It is widely accepted that he was a Himyarite immigrant from Yemen.[1][2][3][4] His dynasty was responsible for converting the local Berber tribes to Islam. Initially the local tribes resisted the restrictions of the new religion and soon deposed their ruler but he was later asked to return and assume power again. His dynasty, the Banu Salih, ruled the region until 1019.\n\nReferences\n\n[edit]"
