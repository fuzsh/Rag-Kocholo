        "text": "The first large image is of a ship belonging to Samuel de Champlain, first explorer of the Pays-d’en-Haut, which is what we know as Ontario today. The caravel symbolizes the successive waves of immigration of all stock having built the French Ontario of today. Their bravery, their determination and their desire to build a Francophone space in Ontario are represented by the colors of the ship. The trillium flower, symbol of Ontario represents Franco-Ontarian pride with a fleur-de-lys, a symbol of the Francophonie in Canada. Colors represent green for summers and white for winters.\n\nThe symbols are the lyre and the masks of the world of the arts, symbols of Franco-Ontarien culture. These cultural symbols of identity pay homage to all Franco-Ontarian artistic creation in all its forms. The maple leaves highlight the Franco Ontarian’s attachment and contribution to Canada, while the bells are the sound and gathering of The Assemblée de la Francophonie de l’Ontario, formerly the provincial ACFO and initially the ACFÉO.\n\nThe fine animal is the beaver, which represents the quest for furs and the movement towards the discovery of ontarian territory by Europeans. The beavers wear books around their necks, representing the importance of education in the fight for identity and the survival of the Franco-Ontarian community. Literary creation is one of the tools for expressing the francophone reality in Ontario. The hat pins recall the fight against regulation 17 which prohibited the teaching of French in the schools of the province from 1912 to 1927. The mothers of the Guigues school in Ottawa used these hat pins in order to prohibit the entry of provincial inspectors into the school who had the mandate to report any breach of the ban on teaching in French. On the other neck of the beaver, we see the miner’s pick and the shovel, honoring the pioneers who actively participated in the discovery and development of the riches of the soil and subsoil, particularly in the north of Ontario. The cultivated field represents agriculture, especially in southern and eastern Ontario, while the evergreens are the story of the pulp and paper industry."
