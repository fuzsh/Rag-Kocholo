        "text": "1836 Article on Guernsey peat known as “Gorban” which is a Hebrew word meaning a gift from god.\n\nGorban\n\nThe supply of gorban from the beach is nearly drained, (it having been such a value as fuel,) I should be sorry to see no record kept.\n\nIn the eastern part of Vason bay, had lain for ages this gorban, unnoticed and unvalued until about eighty years gone by, when an ancestor of the Guille family, having, it is said, dried a few pieces, and found them good fuel, recommended its use among his poor neighbours; like most other things newly brought under notice, it was not, however, for a long time fully appreciated; it was only about thirty years since, that farmers began to be alive to its value; and, uniting in gangs of two or more families, dug regular pits for the gorban, during the low tides. Before this time, small quantities only were hoed at the surface. Few of the minor works of man can be more interesting than that at these pits. As soon as the tide receded, and after having sounded the soil with pointed rods, the pit, the pit was begun by removing, in a diameter of ten or twelve feet, and sometimes to a depth of two or three feet, the sand or pebbles that had accumulated, as the surface of the gorman had been lowered, making a defence of it against the sea. When arrived on the firm gorman, stakes, supporting boards, were stuck into it to preserve the sides; a little drain was also cut all around to receive the water that oozed through the sand, and a boy placed to bale it out and kepp it dry. The men set to, and worked with a will, not like slaves, but like freemen who are working for themselves and families; two or three of them, armed with heavy hoes as sharp as knives, whirling them with force over their heads, cut into it, whilst others flung up pieces, which were carted on shore. They also gained the sides, making the pit much in the shape of a decanter. I have been let down into one of this kind, and found it a most comfortable refuge against the sleet that was sharply drifted above. They worked unceasingly, until the rising tide obliged them to abandon it, but not until the sea had repeatly broken in. I have seen, in a very deep pit the sea break in at once, bringing down shingles, sand, and boards, on two or three men, and hurling them down the ladder; one of them, an old man was not seen for some seconds; the first part that appeared was a hand, holding the spirit bottle, which, in his danger, he had not lost sight of – the man himself twirling round with the eddy formed by the sea falling into such a funnel, until rescued by his companions.\n\nThis precious substance – it may be so called, when its value, as stated below, is considered- to which we can only give the English name of peat, is very unlike the description given of that article; it is firm and perfectly dry, composed entirely of oak, hazel and willow, and other trees, with their leaves mixed with the soil; some of these trees have been found so hard that pits were obliged to be abandonded. Although the gorban is sometimes covered with shingles, a single stone was never found in it; there have, however, often been found nuts, very well preserved, birds nests, and also more rarely, earthen jars, glass bottles, pieces of copper and druids Celts* One was found by, and is now in the possession of Mr De La Rue, Du Croc. How and when all this jumbled together, I am not aware that any thing certain is known. The only thing tradition has left us is, that this was a forest, chiefly of oaks, since submerged by the sea, in which swine were formerly sent to fatten on acorns in the autumn, on paying a certain duty called pesnage, which is continued to this day, and paid to the Lord of the Manor. The gorban occupied a space of about thirty two acres, or one hundred and sixty thousand square yards, and the farmers who have worked it, compute that it has been dug on an average at least three yards in depth- some pits, where the tide gave leisure, have been sunk as deep as eighteen or twenty feet, but others, at the lower part of the beach, only three or four. This gives a total of four hundred and eighty thousand cubic yards, or loads, which, (and it is rather below the above value,) at two shillings and six pence a load, makes the vast sum of £60, 000; as the great demand for it lasted some twenty years, it may be calculated that about £2,000, was, during that period, yearly got out of the Vason. Of its value, as fuel, those can chiefly judge who have been obliged to retreat to the extremity of our farmers large halls, on the evening of a grande querue (big plough), from the intense heat of a fouaie d’gorban, piled on the hearth in lumps, the middling size of those of sea coal, well sheltered behind with smaller pieces, or dried turf, cut for that purpose.\n\nThe gorban is also found in other parts of the beaches, but in such triflling quantities as are not worth recording. It has been dug to some extent in the estate called “Mare de Carteret,” where it is sold for £5 a perch, or forty nine square yards, as the surface, as well as the “Grande Mare,” the “Marais,” and in some valleys in the interior of the island, such as that along Talbot’s road, and others, where imense quantities of hazel nuts are found, some with the kernel surrounding them. I have such in my possession. The gorban in these places is however, no where so good as that of the Vason, but yet very valuable and eagerly sought after as winter fuel.\n\nCatel. L.B.\n\n* It would be useless to attempt to persuade some of our countrymen, that Celts, of which a great number have been found in this island, are not thunderbolts (Axe heads). According to them they also act as insurers against fire, the house where they are kept not being subject to being burnt! There are several of these at the Mechanics Institution of Guernsey.\n\nJersey information:\n\nhttp://www.prehistoricjersey.net/Peat_Bed_Exposure_Le_Port.shtml\n\n“studied by Coventry University in the 1980’s. The uppermost surface of the peat was found to be 90cm thick and a sample from its base gave a radio carbon date of between 6073 – 5848BC for the start of its formation. The study suggested that the St Ouen’s peat beds were formed from an an area of freshwater marshland and fen that had formed between the land and a coastal sand barrier.”\n\nIn 1902 the beach had an exceptional exposure and 500 tree stumps were counted.\n\nlegend of the lost Manor of La Brecquette, it is said that in 1356 a hurricane hit the island and the sea engulfed the area and the manor was lost for ever.\n\nPictures of area in the middle of the Bay by Nigel Utting: http://utting.org/wordpress/jerseys-stone-age-past/\n\nJerripedia – Historical land masses: http://www.theislandwiki.org/index.php/Jersey%27s_separation_from_France\n\n2 Responses »\n\nRecently I’ve taken to walking along St Aubin’s Bay and picking up some litter on the way, pictured above, it mostly consists of plastic bottles, fishing related debris, there is a variety of plastic, polystyrene, and peoples discarded dog poo bags, how senseless is it to put the poo in the bag then leave it on the beach to cause more harm than if they had let the dog do its business then kick a load of sand over it, dog walkers appear happy enough to let their dogs shit all over the cliff paths when their out of sight of others. Regarding plastic bottles the States of Jersey have started recycling these and placed bins around the island I did inform them and it was noted that a bin or bins should be placed along the beaches for this purpose also, and a Scrutiny report also recommended this, it would also be worth having bins for aluminium cans.\n\n14th January 2013 Molly Ward commented in the Jersey Evening Post about a beach clean at St Clement’s Bay she had been part of run by the local branch of Sea Shepherd, she stated that the group had picked up 122 plastic bottles, and ten black bin bags full of a variety of rubbish including netting and rope.\n\nJersey Evening Post 9 th August 2010: “at St Clement and in the 30 minutes it took to walk to Le Marais and back I picked up seven separate items, including two lightbulbs, a florescent light bulb, a large jar of mustard, a large coffee jar and two empty wine bottles. There were more items, but this was as much as I could carry in my rucksack.”\n\nBBC Guernsey 2009: The density of litter on the Channel Island’s beaches is the third highest in the UK and islands, a survey found. About 1,446 items of rubbish were found per kilometre, a 2% rise on 2007.\n\nThe Jersey Evening Post ran the following in 2011: On-the-spot fines could be introduced in a new zero-tolerance approach to littering, according to a report out today. The report says that no littering fines have been given ‘in living memory’ and that it should be a higher priority for the police. The report also proposes fixed-penalty fines for dog fouling, and a tax on litter objects be looked into to cover the cost of collecting and clearing of the objects.\n\nJersey Harbours supply bins for fisherman at the busier harbours for them to put their rubbish, but it would appear many are continuing to throw rubbish in the sea, which is actually destroying the habitat that they rely on for a living.\n\nIt would be good if the States themselves led by example and made sure that what is supposed to be inert waste dumped at La Collette does not include a variety of litter and said litter is cleared up and not allowed to spread into or leach into the surrounding sea.\n\nSurfers against Sewage figures on beach litter:\n\n39.9% from public\n\n5.4% Sewage related debris\n\n11.3% Fishing litter\n\n1.2% fly tipping\n\n3.6% shipping\n\n0.2% medical waste\n\n38.3% non source d\n\nBBC Guernsey 8 th April 2009: http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/europe/guernsey/7989191.stm\n\nJEP 18th July 2011: http://www.thisisjersey.com/latest/2011/07/18/on-the-spot-fines-for-litter/\n\nBBC Jersey 20 th July 2011:http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-jersey-14214753\n\nLa Baguette 2008: http://www.labaguette.org.je/story72.htm\n\nJEP 10th August 2010: http://www.thisisjersey.com/latest/2010/08/10/showing-we-value-our-coastline/\n\nhttp://www.scrutiny.gov.je Scrutiny Report Policing of Beaches and Parks 18th July 2011\n\nOnce discarded litter can remain a hazard in the environment for a very long time:\n\nCigarette Butts – 1 to 5 years\n\nDo you know that an estimated 2 billion cigarette butts are littered every day, and the concentrated toxins in just one cigarette butt is enough to cause long term environmental damage that can take decades to reverse.\n\nOrganics:\n\nOrange and Banana peels – up to 2 years\n\nPaper Bag – 1 month\n\nWood – 10 to 15 years\n\nThese could be composted or mulched\n\nInorganic:\n\nPlastic coated paper – 5 years\n\nPlastic bags – 10 to 20 years\n\nNylon fabric 30 to 40 years\n\nPlastic 6-pack holders – 100 years\n\nItems that could be recycled:\n\nPaper & Cardboard – 1 month – many years\n\nTin Cans – 80 to 100 years\n\nAluminum Cans – 200 to 500 years\n\nGlass Bottles – 1,000,000 years\n\nPlastic Bottles – Unknown, perhaps millions of years\n\nStyrofoam – Unknown, perhaps millions of years\n\nOne Response »\n\nHarvey Memorial erected by the Foresters with the names of the crew who also perished:\n\nH.B.

The “Mary” was on route from Odessa to Grimsby with a cargo of maize. 34 lives were lost.\n\nCaptain Henry Beckford Harvey born 1815 in Fontmell Magna, Dorset never left the bridge. His orders were “Ladies first!”. Great difficulty was experienced in prevailing upon the ladies – some without clothing – to enter the boats. When the “Havre” brought the saved to St Helier words cannot describe the anguish of those that learned of the loss of those nearest and dearest, Mr Advocate Westaway, on hearing of the death of his respected father, was so overcome that his friends had to remove him. It was Mr Westaway who very humanely assisted in saving Miss Clara Godfrey of Jersey. Captain Harvey’s last words were “row fast and clear off, for we’re sinking!”. The man at the wheel was called upon to jump into a boat as she passed to stern of the fast sinking ship. “No, I stick to my ship” he replied. We hear from the last man who left the ship that no person exceeded in coolness and courage or in attempts to save passengers than Mr Westaway. The passengers, until within three minutes of when the boat sank, were expecting the boats from the Mary, but these arrived too late, The “Mary” was very much damagedm and the big lifeboats of the Normandy entirely smashed. Only two boats were intact, The two boats were manned by five seamen and one fireman and eighteen of the passengers (11 females and 7 males) got into them, When the two boats left, the Captain was still standing on the bridge giving directions to the engineers and those under his command. There are eleven widows, twenty children, one mother and one grandmother who have been deprived of means of support, by this terrible calamity. The Normandy was only six years old, a paddle steamer propelled by engines of 238h.p. She was not insured. It is certain that Mr Westaway and Mr Kinlock might have saved themselves if they had preferred their own safety to that of others. Mr John Nathaniel Westaway, at his last moment when standing on the ill-fated ship, and asked to get into the boat of rescue, he exclaimed “No, I am in God’s hands”. How manfully Mr Westaway & Mr Kinlock saved others; how truly gloriously they died!, At the feet of the Captain stood a boy under the bridge called Clements. “We are sinking”, called the Captain to him, “Go with the Ladies, there’s room for you!” “No Sir” was the boy’s reply. “I stay with you”. Mr Cox and his firemen remained in the engine room faithfully obeying the Captain’s orders, and all died, Not a seaman left the ship, save those detailed by the commander to row boats. Greater discipline, sublimer abnegation of self, is not on record.”. Westaway gave up his seat on the lifeboat to Miss Albina Falle\n\nVictor Hugo on the loss of the “Normandy” 1870\n\nThe captain died like a stoic. He was called Harvey. A large vermillion face, white whiskers, and good brave eyes. Three years ago I was onboard his ship.. The English fleet was at Sheerness for the Viceroy of Egypt and Queen Victoria. Some ladies were on board the “Normandy” wished to see the fleet, and begged me to express this desire. It was two hours out of our course. They said “Tell the captain you wish it.” “But ladies,” I answered, “a French ship would not do such a thing for me.” Captain Harvey heard this. He cried, “What a French ship will not do for Victor Hugo an English ship will,” and he put up his helm and showed me the fleet whilst the Queen was showing it to the Khedive.

Well nothing has happened and the monument is looking in a very sorry state, I should imagine this sort of neglect is only going to lead to extra costs when and if any conservation work is to take place.\n\nWreck position: http://www.wrecksite.eu/wreck.aspx?10874\n\nPassenger details (see below also): http://archiver.rootsweb.ancestry.com/th/read/CHANNEL-ISLANDS/2002-12/1040746823\n\nCollection list and some passenger details :http://archiver.rootsweb.ancestry.com/th/read/CHANNEL-ISLANDS/2002-12/1041203514\n\nWestaway (Julia) fund: http://www.theislandwiki.org/index.php/Julia_Westaway\n\nLeave a Response »\n\nDue to the interest of others I became interested in the historical storage of shellfish around the islands which probably started seriously with the oyster fishery boom in the 19th century, pictured above is a a nourrice or couge in which lobsters and crabs are stored, I have tried to find out the meaning and origin of the word couge without any succeess. Nourrice is derived from the Latin nūtrīcia, this and the French meaning is nurse, and we also get the word nourish from this.\n\nTo the north of the start of the slip at Grouet there are four remains of nourrices two of which have remains of iron rails these were taken from the obsolete railway track at Corbiere, when I first came across these I was fortunate to have an elderly low water fishermen come up and ask what I was photographing and it turned out he knew the history of there use, they were used by the local Le Chalet hotel to store a supply of fresh shellfish for their visitors.\n\nDerelict nourrice with railway tracks\n\nThere are some 30 of these nourrices around the island and so far they have been recorded at L’Etacq, Petit Plemont, Bonne Nuit, Rozel, St Catherine’s, Archirondel, Gorey, Grouville Bay, Le Hocq, Elizabeth Castle, and St Aubin, numbering around 30 in total.\n\nFrom here you can make your way down to the low water mark along one of the old tracks that lead the way.\n\nAlthough it is fairly easy to access the low water mark, once down there it is not that easy to make your way along the weed covered rocks and boulders, with Laminaria digitata and Codium tomentosum pictured below:\n\nThere are a number of species that can be found on and under the rocks in this area, including rocklings, squat lobsters, numerous Snakelocks anemones, someone did ask me why they had not seen any beadlet anemones I was not sure of the answer, perhaps they prefer higher more sheltered rock pools.\n\nOrmer – Haliotis tuberculata\n\nThere were only a couple of low water fishermen after ormers each day so it was disappointing to see stones upturned and not replaced as good practice, studies in nearby France have shown that it takes 5 years for a basic growth of sponges to grow again, and a decade or more for some species to re-establish themselves, given that this is the very habitat the ormer relies on, it is a shame these sites are not afforded better protection.\n\n3 Responses »\n\nLaminaria otherwise known as vraic venant at Grouet\n\nThis is a collection of two walks undertaken this January weekend spring tides, firstly on the saturday with the marine biology section of the Société Jersiaise then a short follow up on my own.\n\nWe set off from La Vielle Chaussée where you come to a vraic mark, this is one of many that were placed along St Ouen’s Bay and are mentioned in the law for the gathering of vraic which is one of the oldest surviving laws of the island, it evolved over many centuries of regulations and in 1829 Constable John Le Couteur proposed a new vraicing law and wrote to Sir Robert Peel urging that the new law, drafted by himself and passed by the States of Jersey, should be placed before His Majesty in Council before the coming vraicing season, “in order to put an end to the spoliation and violence which takes place every day”; and he assessed that the vraic of St. Ouen’s Bay alone could be assessed at £5000 annually. His law was passed, and entitled every parishoner to have his share of vraic according to his property. The marks were put in place so as to allow even access to all and vraicking could not commence until these marks were uncovered, thus allowing those from the inland Parishes of St Mary and St John time to reach the beach. Currently there is commercial pressure to scrap the law, I would hope that some sort of compromise could be arranged and collection out of season be licenced, but the public have little or no say in marine management in Jersey which is run by a questionable panel.\n\nIn the Channel Islands vraic was a highly valued fertiliser in 1893 it was said estimated that 30,000 loads of vraic were obtained from Guernsey and Herm and probably more than that from Jersey per year. Sir John Le Couteur (the former Constable of St.Brelade ) in his diaries descibes the early 19th century scenes on the beach which must have been most impressive, he says “I reckoned upwards of 250 carts and 17 boats. Averaging each 4 loads, would make about eleven hundred loads cut and brought up, besides what was sold as vraic venu. Some of the single horse carts had cut six loads, similar amounts are recorded from La Rocque area. The areas that are now carparks along the bay were originallyhighly sort after places set aside for the drying of vraic, and not that long ago the government were discussing the need to create more areas. Times past vraic was dried and burnt in the household and the ashes used as fertiliser, the amount spread on the land was at least twenty bushels ( there are 60lbs to a Bushel) of ashes were said to be required for one vergée of land, Le Couteur was advised to put a cartload of ashes per acre and leave for a month before ploughing . A load of fresh vraic would give you the equivalent of three bushels of ashes, and four loads of fresh vraic at least would be used on one vergée, this over twice the amount recommended in Brittany where it is known as goémon.\n\nMoving down the gully we come across tracks carved out of the rock to allow access to areas and they also serve as areas where vraic collects. The first mention of these vraicking tracks being created was in 1545 by Curé Louis Hamptonne who had rights to the fishing at La Vraquière rock to the north west of Elizabeth Castle. The tracks in the west of the island were created and maintained by the surrounding Parishes with the Constables having the right to sell the vraic brought in with the first and second tides of the season, this money went towards paying those who guarded the vraic over night during the tide, this was limited to 3 shillings per person,. and funds for the tracks.\n\nIn the above photograph you can make out the the track making a flat V along the bottom area. The slipways around the island were made almost entirely for the use of vraicking and in 1903 60 St Ouen farmers petitioned the States requested that another slip be built.\n\nAt the end of a days vraicking the harvesters would gather and have a party drinking the local cider and eating vraic buns.\n\nLoi (1894) sur la Coupe et la Pêche des Vraics le long des Côtes de Jersey.\n\nJersey vraic facebook page!\n\nLeave a Response »"
