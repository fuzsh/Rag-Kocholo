        "text": "Lads and lasses, though you may be searching for a fine and rare brandy to delight your senses, you’ll be hard pressed to find a single Armagnac on a restaurant spirits menu in these United States. Finding a few Armagnacs is rarer still. More Armagnacs than that, well, it’s as rare as mermaid’s tears.\n\nBut friends, I’ve heard rumors of an Armagnac Menu as mighty as a tempest and as boundless as the seas. These tales were told in side-eyed whispers, like an old mariner recounts furtive tales of sea nymphs. The muted tones speak of fine bottles of Armagnac, on offer any given night, poured by the glass. And not just one Armangac, scores of them. Old. And rare. And good! The purported locus for this bacchanal of distilled goodness is the seaside city of Tampa, the venue known as Burn’s Steakhouse.\n\nSo then, when recently invited to dine at the fabled establishment with a hearty group of wine lovers, I struck upon the opportunity. The food would be delectable, the company would be outstanding, and the wine – pulled from Burn’s 600,000 bottle cellar – would be impeccable. But for me, the prospect of an Armagnac bounty was the Siren song.\n\nCould it be real? Does The Menu exist? Are the legends true?\n\nAnd so on the night of the dinner, I arrived early, alone, with the hope of communing with some old & rare Armagnac. Upon entry I was met by the hostess, a steely Janus guarding the mythical gates of brandy heaven. She concentrated all of her crow's feet into one scowl* and cast it upon me, halting my progression. But alas, with some cleverness and luck I circumvented her opposition.\n\nI proceeded to the lounge, which like much of the restaurant, was dripping in red velveteen wall coverings, opulent wall sconces and white marble statues. It appeared as a brothel for spirits, a brandy bordello. If a cask-aged Calypso was to be found anywhere, I reckoned it would be found here.\n\nI was seated and presented with The Menu, a hard-cover tome whose size and weight suggested a prize within. I opened the cover the beheld on the first page - the first page - the italicized word “Armagnacs”. Beneath it, Armangac after glorious Armagnac. Three pages worth, two columns per page, one hundred and twenty one offerings in all. The vintage dates reached back to 1857, when wooden vessels still sailed the oceans and salty seamen still told tales of beautiful sea nyphs. I spied the offerings:\n\nCastarède, Sigognoac, Boingnères.\n\nLoubere, St. Aubin, Janneau.\n\nGrindiniere, Chapoulie, Sempé.\n\nI’ve seen Elysium and it is draped in red velvet.\n\nWhile The Menu rightly deserves hours of study and careful consideration, time was my foe, and so I made four gut-shot selections.\n\nAnd then I waited. Oh, the waiting! If ever the suspense could be more tortuous. Each passing moment was a veritable eternity as anticipation clung to me like barnacles to the hull of a ship. I was caught in the eddies of time, trapped in a whirlpool of longing and frustration, unable to break free and reach the shores of divine fulfillment. But finally, finally, three minutes in, the first pair of Armagnacs arrived.\n\nFirst, a 1924 Domaine de Gaube, singing a melody of cigar box, caramel, black pepper and mint on the nose. The palate was supple and sweet with more caramel, the variety drizzled on ice cream. The finish was long and crisp, with black pepper turning to white, and accompanied by driftwood.\n\nThe sister pairing was a 1926 Domaine de Gaube, conjuring a whirlwind of cinnamon and oak throughout the tasting. The nose offered aromas of fresh ground cinnamon, sous bois and damp wood, the latter of which continued through the palate. The finish was an ornery mix of cinnamon schnapps, moss covered tree bark and liquid bitters.\n\nReveling in the Gaube, the second set arrived.\n\nThe 1964 Domaine Boingnères tendered an intense and complex nose of middle eastern spice, German chocolate and cola, draped with a delicate salinity. Dark cherry reduction and toasted oak appeared on the palate. The finish was marked by toffee and dark chocolate, followed by a long, long, long note of Madera wine.\n\nFinally, desert was provided in the form of a 1966 Domaine Boingnères. Sweet caramel and Irish cream greeted my nose, while the mouth contained notes of whipped cream, espresso dust and rancio. Tiramisu and tannins were effusive on the finish, tempered with sun-softened milk chocolate.\n\nIt was a triumphant tide that swept over me, filling my spirit with an overwhelming sense of contentment and fulfillment, quenching the thirst of my soul and affirming the voyage I had undertaken.\n\nBut alas, like any adventure, the Fates had more in store.\n\nI fell in with my dining companions for a tour of the wine cellar, and after tasting a few bottles in situ we settled into the wood paneled Tchelistcheff Room for what would be an exquisitely long feast. The wine flowed, the food was abundant, the conversation was delightful.\n\nEventually we drifted upstairs to the desert room, which by this time of the evening was completely deserted. Just as well, as our distinguished group of gentlemen, under the spell of Montrachet and Margaux, had devolved into a swashbuckling group of marauders.\n\nA curious collection of ovaline booths stretched before us like boats in a harbour, and we boarded our own woodslatted vessel. Through the clamor desserts were ordered, along with an ancient port, which arrived in its own woven metal skiff."
