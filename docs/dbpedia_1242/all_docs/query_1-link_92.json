        "text": "Louis-Antoine Gougeat (1788-1865) enrolled in a cavalry regiment in 1806. He took part in the campaigns in Spain in the ranks of the 20th Dragoon Regiment. On his return from the Iberian peninsula, he spent some time in Westphalia. In 1814, Gougeat travelled to the Alsace region, to Strasbourg, then to Schlestadt (Sélestat) and continued on to Colmar. Here are some excerpts of his memoirs …\n\n… In between these two towns, my company, which served in the vanguard, encountered a detachment of Cossacks, charged and overthrew them. The Cossacks, while fleeing, set fire to a straw wagon which they found on their path: it appears to be the first act of hostility committed by the enemy on our territory. The Russians passed by the town of Colmar, but did not enter it; as for us, we crossed it and encamped, somewhat beyond, in a small wood bordering the road to Basel.\n\nLater, his journey led him near his hometown, Larzicourt (Marne):\n\nOn arriving there, what a frightening spectacle is presented to my eyes! The Russian army, established on the other side of the Marne, fired cannonballs at the village, which was occupied by a French infantry division; already the houses were seriously damaged; indescribable disorder reigned in the countryside; the terrified inhabitants fled from all sides screaming. Some of them carried children in their arms. My mother and relatives were in despair. Faced with such a scene, I did not have the courage to say goodbye again; I took some oats from a sack, a large loaf of bread and left without saying a word and very much affected.\n\nI rejoined the regiment at the village of Saint-Vérain, where we spent the night. We were billeted in a large, isolated farmhouse whose stables were all crammed with horses. The Polish Lancers occupied it together with us. While, in the large kitchen of the farm, I was preparing the soup and our officers, wrapped in their coats, were sleeping, lying on the straw in the stables, I suddenly heard a great clamour of trumpets outside; I ran to obtain intelligence and learned that the Emperor was arriving with his Guard via the road to Vitry. I hastened to inform my captain and the other officers, who received my message with a certain indifference; none of them bothered.\n\nAt 4 o’clock, the Polish Lancers departed from the farm, which they left behind in a terrible mess, and joined the Imperial Guard; we, the dragoons, moved out at 6 o’clock. The sky was clear, the cold was intense; snow had fallen during the night […] . We stayed a few days at Allichamps and in other villages situated between Eclaron and Vassy. We then headed for Hampigny, one league from Brienne, where the entire army was assembled; the Russians and Prussians were very close to us.\n\nThaw intervened; we had great difficulty in moving through the soggy ground; the roads were impassable; the artillery could only travel at the cost of great efforts. The Emperor arrived with his Guard and gave his orders for the battle. The Russians and the Prussians were vigorously attacked; they fought all day. Towards the evening, the enemy was driven out of Brienne and pursued in the plains of the Aube. In the night following the battle of Brienne, we left for Troyes. We arrived there at the moment when the Hubert bridge was to be severed, in the suburb of Arcis. After having travelled for a few days and conducted numerous reconnaissance in the vicinity of this town, we descended, along the Seine, to Nogent.\n\nOne day when my company was on guard duty in a meadow in front of the village of Saint-Aubin, a general sent us the order to inquire about the nationality of a large post established at some distance from us. The company advanced on this side, but was arrested by a wide and deep stream which none of our dragoons could cross; only Captain de Marcy, mounted on his magnificent horse called Isabelle, jumped across it with the greatest ease and, approaching the presumed post, he shouted in a loud voice: ‘Who goes there?’ They were Austrian cuirassiers. To the audacious provocation of the French officer they replied with a general discharge of their muskets, the bullets of which whizzed past his ears, but without striking him; then they charged upon him. Without hurrying much and with the greatest composure, my captain returned to the stream which he crossed with the same ease as the first time and, when the Austrians arrived in their turn, at the little stream which they could not pass, de Marcy had his dragoons fire on them, killing two of them.\n\nWe proceeded below Nogent, always along the Seine. We passed the river at Montereau and went to occupy a small village called Chennevières, which is said to be only four leagues from Paris; we remained there only for a few days.\n\nWhile returning on the Seine, our army pursued and pushed back a corps of allied forces into Montereau. We were filled with ardour and enthusiasm; we believed ourselves already on the Rhine.\n\nThe town of Montereau and its hillsides were covered with troops; a fierce struggle began in the town itself and on the heights. After a long and obstinate resistance, the enemy armies were completely defeated; they fled on all sides, pursued by our cavalry which crossed the bridge after them, my company being one of the first.\n\nAt the moment when our artillery was about to engage in its turn on the long and narrow bridge, many dead bodies of men and horses were thrown into the river which obstructed or hindered the passage. Remaining behind my company, I took advantage, to cross, of a narrow interval left clear during the march of the artillery and I found myself with one of our officers named Mr. Robin, who, like me, had been separated from the regiment, in one of those moments of confusion so common during cavalry engagements.\n\nMr. Robin and I endeavoured, but in vain, to rejoin the 20th Dragoons, whose itinerary we knew only vaguely. Finally, after 17 days of marching and searching, we found it camped in the vineyards of Essoyes, a large town near Bar-sur-Seine.\n\nWe left the camp at Essoyes to travel back from the Aube. After having travelled through various places we had already covered, we found ourselves again, from 15 to 18 March, in the vicinity of Nogent. There, we received the order to return to Arcis. By ascending the Seine and the Aube, we departed at once for this city where the Imperial Guard and several army corps were evidently gathering in anticipation of a great battle. The Russian, Prussian and Austrian armies were concentrated in the plain in front of Arcis, on the road to Troyes. A few days ago, the Russians burned down the small town of Méry.\n\nWhile the French army marched to assume position on the plain, we were ordered to roll up our coats and make arrangements to charge. We crossed the town in turn, and the battle began.\n\nOur squadrons, too few in number, clashed, but unsuccessfully, with the enormous mass of enemy cavalry; they were driven back to Arcis. We reformed in the avenue of the château, on the banks of the river; other disbanded corps joined us. We set off again; we fought all day. Eventually, we slept on our positions.\n\nThe next day, we left Arcis with the Emperor and the Guard, and we marched on the road to Vitry. We spent the night at Dampierre from where we could still hear the gunfire at Arcis. We crossed the Marne at Frignicourt, a small village situated half a league from Vitry. There, the entire army paraded in front of the Emperor and greeted him with cheers; seated at a small table in front of the church, he was leaning over a map spread out in front of him and did not move.\n\nThe regiment was sent to Vitry. It then went on reconnaissance in the villages situated between Vitry and Saint-Dizier. Several times, we passed and returned to Larzicourt, my hometown, whose appearance was most desolate. The few inhabitants that we met, and to who I was careful not to reveal myself, were sad and dejected; one could perceive that they were still under the impression of the terrible (scene of the) bombardment that I mentioned earlier. Glancing at my mother’s house, I was distressed at the sight of the furniture piled up in the street …\n\nThe next day we set off along the Montiérender road and arrived at the foot of the village of Moelain, below and not far from Saint-Dizier. This village is situated at the top of a small hill of vineyards at the bottom of which the Marne flows. On the other side of the river is the village of Hoëricourt, with a vast plain.\n\nIt was 10 o’clock in the morning, the weather was splendid, the sun was shining brightly. The Russian army moved across the plain. At the sight of the enemy, our army, guided by the inhabitants of the country, crossed the Marne at the ford of Hoëricourt, en masse and in perfect order. Having arrived on the other bank, it was welcomed by the Russian cavalry whose assault it received without flinching, our cavalry charged it in turn; a terrible melee ensued during which the enemy squadrons were driven back several times. Finally, after two hours of bitter fighting, the Emperor sent in the cavalry of his Guard upon the Russians, who sabred them and caused them to fall into a complete rout. They disbanded and fled at full gallop: some in the direction of Vitry and the others via the road to Bar-le-Duc.\n\nI did not take part in the action, but I witnessed it unfold at my feet, from the top of the small hill of Moelain, where I was in the company of the regimental paymaster. The crossing of the Marne by our cavalry, whose horses appeared to us to be no larger than sheep in the middle of the river, and the clash of the squadrons on the plain under the rays of beautiful sunlight which caused thousands of sparks to reflect from the weapons and helmets, was one of the most beautiful spectacles I have ever seen.\n\nCrossing the battlefield in the evening, I recognised, among the dead, several dragoons of my regiment and an officer of the 19th Dragoons. I encountered Mr. Lallemant, an officer in my company, injured at the shoulder, who asked me to dress his wound. Near the main road there were cavalrymen who offered, but without success, to sell to their officers the horses they had taken from the enemy.\n\nI joined my company at the village of Longchamp where it had halted after having assisted in the pursuit of the Russians; we spent the night there.\n\nWe stayed between Vitry and Saint-Dizier for several days, deeply saddened at the sight of the devastation wrought by the foreign armies in this region, which had previously been so flourishing and was now thoroughly devastated. In the villages, few houses remained intact. Among those that are still standing, some are supported only by their columns; others have no roofs; some walls are toppled or shattered, doors and windows stand open. Inside, there is nothing left. A deadly silence hangs over these ruins; the inhabitants have fled, along with their cattle, into the depths of the nearby forests in order to escape the vexations and brutality of the enemy.\n\nWe crossed the Marne again, overwhelmed by this depressing spectacle, and headed for Vandoeuvre. From there, we travelled to Troyes, Sens, then Fontainebleau.\n\nOn arriving at Fontainebleau, on a day when it was slightly foggy, my regiment formed up in battle array on the main road, close to a château. For a long time we remained there motionless and silent. From time to time, vague rumours reached us from the town; officers galloped past and back again; their faces were gloomy. We could sense and guess that serious events were afoot. Soon we were informed of the capitulation of Paris and the Emperor’s abdication. Suddenly cavalry could be heard marching towards Fontainebleau and we saw several carriages arriving, escorted by a squadron of Guards Lancers. At the moment when they passed in front of us, an arm came out of one of them and waved as a sign of farewell; we were told that it was the Emperor who was leaving and bidding us farewell. The emotion was intense, hearts were oppressed, eyes welled up with tears …\n\nSource : Le Carnet de la Sabretache, 1901, pp. 412-421. Re-issued in 1997 by Teissèdre Editions."
