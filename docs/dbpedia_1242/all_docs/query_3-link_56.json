        "text": "English as the Official Language of Parliament\n\nUnited Canada was created to give the English-speaking community an advantage over the French-speaking community. In the mid-19th century, political decision makers took little interest in language issues, except when they had to. The notion of institutional bilingualism was still foreign to them. In 1848, Switzerland (probably overlooked) was the only country in the world practicing institutional bilingualism (French/German). In such circumstances, it went without saying that English would be the only official language of the new Parliament, as set out in Section 41 of the Act of Union:\n\nSection 41\n\nAnd be it enacted, That from and after the said Reunion of the said Two Provinces all Writs, Proclamations, Instruments for summoning and calling together the Legislative Council and Legislative Assembly of the Province of Canada, and for proroguing and dissolving the same, and all Writs of Summons and Election, and all Writs and public Instruments whatsoever relating to the said Legislative Council and Legislative Assembly, or either of them, and all Returns to such Writs and Instruments, and all Journals, Entries, and written or printed Proceedings, of what Nature so ever, of the said Legislative Council and Legislative Assembly, and of each of them respectively, and all written or printed Proceedings and Reports of Committees of the said Legislative Council and Legislative Assembly respectively, shall be in the English Language only: Provided always, that this Enactment shall not be construed to prevent translated Copies of any such Documents being made, but no such Copy shall be kept among the Records of the Legislative Council or Legislative Assembly, or be deemed in any Case to have the Force of an original Record.\n\nIt was the first time since the Conquest that Great Britain (officially the United Kingdom since 1801) had proscribed the use of French in a constitutional text, testifying to the British government's newfound assimilationist intentions. French was to become but a language of translation, with no legal value. Section 31 did not, however, formally prohibit the use of French in the parliamentary debate: in fact, of this, it made no mention.\n\nNot unexpectedly, the Act of Union sparked a wave of protest in Canada East (Québec). From the outset, Louis-Hippolyte Lafontaine (1807–1864), lawyer and joint head of the Executive Council, tried to convince Parliament to accept the use of French. After having demanded the Chamber meet as a general committee in 1842, he addressed the members from United Canada in these terms:\n\nTo begin, I must make allusion to the attack by the honourable member for Toronto, who has so often been presented to us as a friend of the French Canadian people. Has he already forgotten that I belong to that nationality which has been so horribly ill-treated by the Act of Union? If so, I would find it most regrettable. He asks me to deliver in a language other than my maternal tongue the first speech I have to deliver in this house! I distrust my ability to speak the English language. But I must inform the honourable members that even if I knew English as well as French, I would still make my first speech in the language of my French Canadian countrymen, if only to protest solemnly the cruel injustice of that part of the Act of Union which aims to proscribe the mother tongue of half the population of Canada. I owe it to my countrymen, I owe it to myself.\n\nThe purpose of the Union, in the mind of its author, was to crush the French population: but a mistake has been made, for the means employed will not achieve this result. Without our active cooperation, without our participation in power, the government cannot function in such a way as to re-establish the peace and confidence essential to the success of any administration. Placed by the Act of Union in an exceptional situation, as a minority with respect to the distribution of political power, should we succumb, we shall at least succumb by commanding respect.\n\nThe Parliament of United Canada sought to temper the impact of Section 41 by adopting various measures to facilitate the translation of laws and other parliamentary documents. During the session of 1844, Francophone members presented a motion requiring that the speaker of the assembly be able to speak English and French. As a result, Allan McNab, an eminent but unilingual member of the William Henry Draper government (1843–1846), was not eligible for re-election and was replaced by Augustin-Norbert Morin. The following year (February 17, 1845), Francophone members presented another resolution demanding that official versions of parliamentary texts also be produced in French. Allan McNab rejected the resolution, sparking a vote in the assembly which his side won by a single vote. Subsequently, Francophone members decided to ask the British government to simply abrogate Section 41 of the Act of Union. They had to endure endless parliamentary procedural maneuvering and the bad faith of Governor Charles Theophilus Metcalfe (1843-1845) but in the end, the Parliament of United Canada unanimously approved the request and forwarded it to the British government.\n\nSpurred on by Louis-Hyppolite Lafontaine, Lord Elgin pestered the British government to agree to the demands of the Canadian Parliament regarding bilingualism. Writing to Lafontaine on June 15, 1848, Elgin affirmed, \"I am certain that the next post from Downing Street will inform me of what you intend to do to secure the repeal of the restrictions imposed by the Act of Union with respect to the use of French.\" The Francophone opposition had been so intense since 1841 that London finally decided to accept use of the French language. It repealed Section 41 to restore the de facto bilingualism that had existed prior to the Act of Union by passing An Act to repeal so much of an Act of the Third and Fourth Years of Her present Majesty, to re-unite the Provinces of Upper and Lower Canada, and for the Government of Canada, as relates to the Use of the English Language in Instruments relating to the Legislative Council and Legislative Assembly of the Province of Canada. Here are paragraphs 11 and 12 Victoria, ch. LVI, of the 1848 amendment rescinding Section 41 of the Act of Union of 1840, which made English the sole language of parliamentary record.\n\nWHEREAS by an Act [1841] [...] it is amongst other things enacted, that all Writs, Proclamations, Instruments for summoning and calling together […], and all Writs of Summons and Elections, and all Writs and Public Instruments whatsoever relating to the said Legislative Council and Legislative Assembly, or either of them, and all Returns to such Writs and Instruments, and all Journals, Entries and written or printed Proceedings of what Nature soever, of the said Legislative Council and Legislative Assembly, and of each of them respectively, and all written or printed Proceedings and Reports of Committees of the said Legislative Council and Legislative Assembly respectively, shall be in the English Language only: Provided always, that the said Enactment should not be construed to prevent translated Copies of any such Documents being made, but no such Copy should be kept among the Records of the Force of an original Record: And whereas it is expedient to alter the Law in this respect, in order that the Legislature of the Province of Canada, or the said Legislative Council and Legislative Assembly respectively, may have Power to make such Regulations herein as to them may seem advisable:' Be it therefore enacted by the Queen's most Excellent Majesty, by and with the Advice and Consent of the Lords Spiritual and Temporal, and Commons, in this present Parliament assembled, and by the Authority of the same, That from and after the passing of this Act so much of the said recited Act as is herein-before recited shall be repealed [...].\n\nThe 1848 amendment did not formally allow for the use of French, but rather repealed the provisions imposing English as the only language. In any case, as of 1849, the official texts of all laws were passed in both French and English. It could be said that the act revoking Section 41 of the Act of Union was a remedial law that restored a legitimacy to the French language that a poorly inspired piece of legislation had taken away for a number of years. Since no simultaneous interpretation was available during parliamentary debates, members expressing themselves in French were \"condemned\" to being understood solely by their French-speaking colleagues. The inverse was also true. The repeal bill did not change the de facto institutional unilingualism prevailing in Upper Canada (which became Canada West), but did establish the de jure bilingual character of the joint Legislative Assembly of Upper (Western Canada) and Lower Canada (Eastern Canada). Lord Elgin, the governor general, opened the session of the United Canada Parliament in Montreal by giving part of his throne speech in French. It was the first time since the end of the French regime that a representative of the Crown had formally conducted this parliamentary ritual in both languages.\n\nIt may be worth mentioning another element related to the absence of language provisions in the Act of Union of 1840. Certain legal specialists argue even though the act did not concern language, it gave French quasi-official status by recognizing French civil law. Since this law was originally written in French, this amounted to implicit recognition of French alongside English. The same thing happened in Louisiana after the colony was sold to the United States by Napoleon Bonparte on April 30, 1803. When Louisiana became an American state on April 30, 1812, English was named the only official language, but French civil law was also recognized. The courts even ruled in 1825 that in the event of a conflict of interpretation, the French version took precedence over the translated English version. However, after the U.S. Civil War (Louisiana was a slave state), the new 1868 Constitution prohibited the use of any other language than English.\n\nThe laws, public records, and judicial and legislative proceedings of the State shall be promulgated and preserved in the English language; and no law shall require judicial process to be issued in any other than the English language.\n\nThis marked the end of institutional bilingualism in Louisiana. In 1870, the Civil Code was overhauled and adapted in English only. The Code of Civil Procedure was also revised, and any obligation regarding the use of French removed. Then, out of patriotic duty (see the famed slogan \"One flag, one nation, one language\"), the Irish-descended high clergy eliminated French from the schools. In other words, the law is nothing without the force of law!\n\nThe well-known Montréal Herald polemicist also declared that French Canadians were a pampered lot who had received more than their share of attention since the Conquest, whereas \"English subjects\" had been neglected. He believed that the policy of conciliation promoted by Governor Gosford (1835–1838) had allowed the vanquished French Canadians to dictate colonial policy to the victorious British. Loyalists denounced this policy, fearing that London would look favourably on the French Canadians and end up giving in to their grievances by granting them more powers.\n\nLoyalist organizations banded together in an umbrella committee—the Montréal Constitutional Association (MCA)—in January 1835. A similar organization—the Québec Constitutional Association (QCA)—had been founded in Québec City in December 1834. These bodies were set up to defend the Constitution of 1791 and preserve the Legislative Assembly in its existing form. But the loyalists were not content to form constitutional associations and hold public meetings, they also began setting up armed organizations. Adam Thom, the leader of the \"British\" of Montréal, defended these militias in the December 12, 1835, edition of his paper:\n\nThe organization, to combine moral determination and physical force, must be both military and political. We as much need an Army as a Congress. We need pikes and rifles as much as wisdom (...) Therefore let us call a provincial congress immediately and increase the British Rifle Corp. of Montréal to 800, which is its full complement, let us send deputies to win the sympathies of the neighbouring provinces.\n\nIt was increasingly clear that the English minority had no intention of letting itself be governed by French Canadians, and was even prepared to put up armed resistance. Adam Thom freely called for the ransacking of Francophone villages.\n\nPast history proves that nothing short of their disappearance from the land and the reduction of their homes to dust will prevent new rebellions south of the St. Lawrence, or new invasions by the Americans.\n\nAfter the British Rifle Corp was disbanded in January 1836, another paramilitary organization—the Doric Club—was founded by a group of young armed loyalists. In their manifesto of March 16, 1836, club members declared that they would rather give their lives than submit to a French Canadian republic.\n\nIf we are deserted by the British government and the British people, rather than submit to the degradation of being subject of a French-Canadian republic, we are determined by our own right arms to work out our deliverance..., we are ready... to pledge to each other our lives, our fortunes and our sacred honor.\n\nIn the English-language papers, certain journalists publicly shared their views with the Queen's representative, Lord Durham, as evidenced by this June 1838 excerpt from the Missiskoui Standard, published in Frelighsburg in the Eastern Townships:\n\nIt is foolishness for the French Canadians to fight their destiny. It is impossible that a handful of Frenchmen in the extreme north-east can rise to the state of a nation, against the entrepreneurial genius of a race that has already covered most of this continent. It's more than foolishness. Since 1791 and until last year, the French sought to defy their fate; and despite having all manner of legislative facilities, they did not succeed. They oppressed the Anglo-Saxon race residing in this province, and sought to keep away those who wanted to come. And what was the result of all this? They failed. The legal power they possessed was not proportionate to their end; and when in desperation they had recourse to force to accomplish their favourite desire, the Anglo-Saxon race, like a boa constrictor, wrapped itself around them, pressed them on all sides, and crushed them.\n\nThe October 18, 1838, edition of the Montréal Gazette also featured an interpretation of the source of problems with the French Canadian community:\n\nWhat is, we ask, the real cause of the state of division in which this province finds itself, and of the maladministration and anarchy to which it has long been submitted? What is it, other than that the majority of its inhabitants are of foreign origin, custom, law, language, and institutions to that of the nation at large, and that no attempt has yet been made to assimilate them into the ways of the Mother Country.\n\nFor various reasons, Lord Durham had little contact with French Canadians during his six-month stay in Canada. Instead, he surrounded himself with Anglophone advisers who viewed the French Canadians as a backward and illiterate people constantly manipulated by irresponsible leaders. In contrast, these same advisers were convinced that the English-speaking minority was well governed and had the province's best interests at heart. It was not without irony that French immigrant and journalist Napoléon Aubin (1812 – 1880), founder of the newspaper Le Fantasque, warned Lord Durham against using words such as British in 1838:\n\nIt would seem, Milord you have taken it upon yourself to make French Canadians understand that their hour has come, hope has run out, and they now must endure slavery and contempt to atone for the grave sin of not being English. All the trappings man covets are denied them: titles, honours, and consideration are taken from them and offered to those who insult them at will […] You plan to defend British interests! Ay, My Lord, do change this word, for it is a vile one. Say you shall defend colonial interests, provincial interests or whatever you may choose, but not British interests; for you see, you will not be understood here. All that is abuse and cruelty, all that is tyranny, ignorance, oppression, and intolerance, has been shrouded by your compatriots in the word British.\n\nIn these conditions, it is no surprise that Lord Durham developed such a poor opinion of the French Canadians. Here are several excerpts from his report on the topic:\n\nThey (the Canadiens) are an old and stationary society, in a new and progressive world. In all things and places they have remained French, but Frenchmen who in no way resemble those of France. Rather, they resemble the French of the Ancien Régime. [...]\n\nThe French Canadians, on the other hand, are but the remains of an ancient colonization, and are and ever must be isolated in the midst of an Anglo-Saxon world. [...]\n\nThere can hardly be conceived a nationality more destitute of all that can invigorate and elevate a people, than that which is exhibited by the descendants of the French in Lower Canada, owing to their retaining their peculiar language and manners. They are a people with no history, and no literature. The literature of England is written in a language which is not theirs; and the only literature which their language renders familiar to them, is that of a nation from which they have been separated by eighty years of a foreign rule, and still more by those changes which the Revolution and its consequences have wrought in the whole political, moral and social state of France. [...]\n\nIn Durham's eyes, the English, on the other hand, were a superior race, and English the dominant language:\n\nThe language, the laws, the character of the North American Continent are English; and every race but the English (I apply this to all who speak the English language) appears there in a condition of inferiority. It is to elevate them from that inferiority that I desire to give to the Canadians our English character. I desire it for the sake of the educated classes, whom the distinction of language and manners keeps apart from the great Empire to which they belong. At the best, the fate of the educated and aspiring colonist is, at present, one of little hope, and little activity; but the French Canadian is cast still further into the shade, by a language and habits foreign to those of the Imperial Government. [...]\n\nThe English have already in their hands the majority of the larger masses of property in the country; they have the decided superiority of intelligence on their side; they have the certainty that colonization must swell their numbers to a majority; and they belong to the race which wields the Imperial Government, and predominates on the American Continent.\n\nAnglicization of the French Canadians and their transformation into a minority went hand-in-hand, and were to be the main objective of colonial authorities. To this end, Lord Durham encouraged London to promote massive English immigration:\n\nWithout effecting the change so rapidly or so roughly as to shock the feelings and trample on the welfare of the existing generation, it must henceforth be the first and steady purpose of the British Government to establish an English population, with English laws and language, in this Province, and to trust its government to none but a decidedly English legislature. [...]\n\nI believe that tranquility can only be restored by subjecting the province to the vigorous rule of an English majority; and that the only efficacious government would be that formed by a legislative union.\n\nBut, I repeat that the alteration of the character of the Province ought to be immediately entered on, and firmly, though cautiously, followed up; that in any plan, which may be adopted for the future management of Lower Canada, the first object ought to be that of making it an English Province; and that, with this end in view, the ascendancy should never again be placed in any hands but those of an English population. Indeed, at the present moment this is obviously necessary: in the state of mind in which I have described the French Canadian population, as not only now being, but as likely for a long while to remain, the trusting them with an entire control over this Province would be, in fact, only facilitating a rebellion. Lower Canada must be governed now, as it must be hereafter, by an English population; and thus the policy, which the necessities of the moment force on us, is in accordance with that suggested by a comprehensive view of the future and permanent improvement of the Province [...]\n\nFor Lord Durham, perpetual negligence by the British government was the explanation for the lack of freedom and civilization among French Canadians. \"It has left them without instruction and without the organizations of local responsible government, which would have enabled it to assimilate their race and customs easily and expeditiously, for the greater benefit of the Empire to which they belong.\" Durham saw \"no hope for their nationality,\" in part because they could never break away from the British Empire unless they decided to go it alone (in \"a wretched semblance of feeble independence\"), joined some sort of potential \"English Confederacy,\" or eventually opted for \"merging in the American Union.\"\n\nIn short, the British Empire needed to act quickly to definitively resolve the problem of \"two nations warring in the bosom of a single state\" and \"squelch the mortal hatred that now divides the inhabitants of Lower Canada into two hostile groups: the French and the English.\" Obviously, many French Canadians were outraged by the report's recommendations with respect to assimilation as well as by the insinuation that they possessed neither culture nor history.\n\nAfter the Act of Union, Francophones stood helplessly by in the face of anti-French determinism. Encouraged into submission by the clergy, they believed in their \"grand\" spiritual destiny while the Anglophone community took control of the economy and secured the capital required for industrialization and urbanization.\n\nIn 1853, the Clear Grits ( meaning tenacious or dedicated), the radical party of Canada West led by George Brown (1818–1880), began denouncing the French Domination of a government it felt to be imposing its will on Canada West. The Clear Grits were Francophobes with a virulent anti-Catholic streak. On November 22, 1850, Lord Elgin wrote to Albert Henry George (Earl Grey), who would be Canada's Governor General from 1904 until 1911:\n\nEvery day, the hatred of the Clear Grit Party for Francophones is more and more apparent. Mr. Boulton, the former chief justice of Newfoundland and a leader of sorts of the Clear Grits is said to have declared at a public dinner the other day that \"Negroes are the great difficulty of the United States, and French Canadians that of Canada,\" a sentiment likely to catch in the craw of a somewhat sensitive and distrustful people.\n\nBut the Clear Grits also defended liberal ideas, demanding non-denominational schools, the annexation of the West, proportional representation in Parliament, universal and secret suffrage, an elected legislative council, etc. They also denounced a system that forced the Legislative Assembly to pass separate bills for Canada West or Canada East, and sometimes for the two Canadas. The double majority principle applied for all legislation with implications for both Canadas, which is why Parliament was becoming so inefficient and costly. But the Liberals did not have sufficient parliamentary representation to push George Brown's reforms through.\n\nThe Anglophones of Canada West were frustrated with equal Anglophone and Francophone representation in the Assembly given that Canada West's population had outgrown that of Canada East by 60,000 people. With English immigration broadening the gap, the political situation could only get worse. The Clear Grits were categorically opposed to what they considered the French Domination of Canada. In 1856, George Brown described the situation reigning in the United Canada Legislative Assembly as one of two countries, two languages, two religions, and two ways of thinking and acting. He wondered whether it would be possible for the two nations to share a single Legislature and a single Executive.\n\nAnglophones demanded constitutional reform that would ensure them proportional representation in Parliament. In light of the continual parliamentary instability, they began to toy with the idea of a federation of all the British colonies. Anglophone reformers had no particular interest in the maritime colonies, but they were fed up with the so-called French Domination. However, they needed Québec, because they wanted to hang on to its numerous canals and railways, as well as the port of Montréal. For them, the ideal solution was two provinces with separate cultural and political institutions, but joined by a common market.\n\nThe Confederation Initiative\n\nEventually, the Clear Grits earned the support of the electoral majority in Canada West, where their opposition to the business capitalists earned them the support of peasants and workers. In 1857, John Alexander Macdonald, a Conservative from Canada West, joined forces with Catholic Conservative George-Étienne Cartier (often written Georges in French) of Canada East. As Lord Elgin had predicted, the Francophobic attitude of the Clear Grits in Canada West had pushed numerous liberal-leaning citizens in Canada East into the Conservative camp, transforming the party into a national organization. In 1864, George Brown proposed that the Conservative leaders of the two Canadas join him and the Liberals of Canada West in establishing a coalition government favourable to a federal union of the two provinces. To avoid political isolation, George-Étienne Cartier, the leader of the Canada East reformers, joined the coalition, where he played an active role in establishing a federal union. This \"Grand Coalition,\" as it would come to be known, included three of the four main political groups in United Canada: Macdonald's Anglophone Conservatives, Cartier's Francophone Conservatives, and Brown's reformers.\n\nAt the same time, the colonies of Nova Scotia, New Brunswick, and Prince Edward Island were exploring the possibility of a Maritime federation and a possible economic union with the other provinces. Brown's proposal proved of central importance in negotiations for the confederation of the British North American colonies. The idea was to establish a confederation with a central government that would handle the federation's general and national affairs, along with a government in each province responsible for local affairs. In September 1864, the coalition government of United Canada was invited to Charlottetown, in the colony of Prince Edward Island, for a conference attended by Nova Scotia, New Brunswick, Prince Edward Island, and Newfoundland. The coalition piqued the interest of the Maritime Provinces with its proposal, and a second conference was held one month later in Québec City. It was here that the negotiators, later known as the \"Fathers of Confederation,\" drafted the \"72 resolutions\" that were to form the basis of the future Canadian constitution.\n\nDuring this same period, Great Britain was beginning to find that Canada was a heavy financial burden on the British Treasury. The cost of maintaining a contingent of 50,000 troops was at least two million pounds a year, a sum deemed enormous. British authorities grew convinced that by grouping the British North American colonies together, they could solve their spending problems. Edward Cardwell, Secretary of State for the Colonies from 1864 to 1866, made his intentions clear in this letter:\n\nHer Majesty's government firmly believes that it is most desirable that all the British colonies of North America agree to come together in a single government. [...] The provinces of British North America are incapable, separated and divided as they are, of making the necessary preparations for their national defence, a task that could easily be assumed by a single province counting all the population and all the resources of the land at its disposal.\n\nLanguage Question\n\nWhen negotiations on establishing a Confederation of the British North American colonies got underway in 1864, the legal status of English and French was as follows: in the province of United Canada, made up of Canada West and Canada East, French and English were recognized as official languages in the joint House of Assembly and joint courts, whereas in the other colonies (Nova Scotia, New Brunswick, Prince Edward Island, and Newfoundland), English was the only language in use. Under the projected federal framework, where two or more provinces would have their own government, two linguistic groups would find themselves in a situation of heightened minority status: the French Canadians, already a minority in the province of Canada (Canada West and Canada East), would become even more of a minority when the other colonies joined the federation; and the Anglophones of Canada East, who would in some respects be \"cut off\" from their Canada West compatriots because they lived in a province with a French majority.\n\nAmong the resolutions adopted at the Québec Conference in 1864, only one concerned language. It was Resolution No. 46, and it read as follows:\n\nBoth the English and French languages may be employed in the General Parliament and in its proceedings, and in the Local Legislature of Lower Canada, and also in the Federal Courts and in the Courts of Lower Canada.\n\nThis version was somewhat different from the original proposal by Alexander Tilloch Galt, one of the negotiators and defenders of the provision respecting the protection of Protestant minority education rights in Québec. Galt's text only made allusion to the federal courts in Canada East, which did not go over very well with the French Canadians. Once the debate on the resolutions got underway in Canada East, Francophones pointed out that the clause provided no guarantees and called for replacing the word \"may\" by the word \"shall\" with respect to the language of Parliament and the legislature. Their demands were not to go unheeded!\n\nInfluence of the American Civil War\n\nAnother element affecting the Confederation debate was the thorny matter of the Civil War that had been raging in the United States since 1861, and did not end until 1865. The main cause of the conflict was slavery in the Southern states. This issue interested the negotiators of Confederation because it touched upon the rights and powers of the states (and by extension the potential powers of the provinces) with respect to those of the Union (and by extension, the federal government). Macdonald wanted to avoid the breakup of the central government by granting it as many powers as possible, and leaving the provinces with the strict minimum necessary for a federal system. He seems to have envisaged the central government as the \"master\" and the provinces as being at its beck and call. In the long term, he hoped to reduce the provincial governments to the rank of glorified municipalities (as in New Zealand).\n\nSince the United Kingdom and its North American colonies supported the South in the war, the tension between the United States and the British North American colonies soon escalated into a political crisis. As a result, the Civil War convinced many Canadians that Confederation was undoubtedly the best way to keep British North America independent from the United States. Certain politicians believed that a union of the British colonies would protect them against eventual annexation by the Americans.\n\nFrom the United Kingdom's point of view, a federation of British North American colonies seemed very appealing, since the new federation would assume its own defence spending. The British government made its position known in December 1864 and brought pressure to bear on the governors posted in Halifax, N.S., Fredericton, N.B., Charlottetown, P.E.I., and St. John's, Newfoundland. Colonial authorities eventually replaced a recalcitrant governor in Nova Scotia, threatened two others in Newfoundland and P.E.I., and sparked a coup d'état in New Brunswick. The strategy was partially successful.\n\nFour Provinces Sign On\n\nIn 1865, provincial representatives gathered at the Parliament of United Canada to review the constitutional resolutions. Speaking on February 7, 1865, George-Étienne Cartier declared his belief that the various national groups would preserve their respective identities under Confederation:\n\nIn our own Federation we should have Catholic and Protestant, English, French, Irish and Scotch, and each by his efforts and his success would increase the prosperity and glory of the new Confederacy [...]. It was a benefit rather than otherwise that we had a diversity of races. [...]\n\nWhen the vote was held, the project won massive approval among delegates from Canada West, the colony most in favour of Confederation; Canada East approved by a bare two-vote majority (due to strong divisions among Francophones), thanks to the appeal of getting a new provincial government; but strong resistance remained in the Maritimes. Despite pressure from the British government, only New Brunswick and Nova Scotia voted for Confederation.\n\nAll of these negotiations were held without consulting the populations concerned, even though the new federal framework would affect them for centuries to come. Nova Scotia reformers led by Joseph Howe (1804–1873) reproached the \"federalists\" for not having received a mandate from the population to negotiate a deal. John A. Macdonald wrote most of the new constitution himself. As he confided to Justice Gowan of Barrie, \"All that is good or bad in the Constitution is of me.\" Macdonald took his inspiration from both the British model (constitutional monarchy with a parliamentary regime) and the American model (a federation with a central government that shares jurisdictions with regional governments).\n\nFinally, on May 8, 1867, the British Parliament passed the British North America Act (which was officially renamed the Constitution Act, 1867). The new constitution received Queen Victoria's royal assent on March 29, 1867, and was proclaimed at noon on July 1 of the same year. Confederation, therefore, came into effect on July 1 under the official name of the Dominion of Canada. The inhabitants of New Brunswick and Nova Scotia were very disappointed and objected strongly, but had no legal grounds for action. Macdonald and his Conservatives emerged victorious from the first federal election and went on to form Canada's first government and dominate the federal scene for the next three decades."
