        "text": "With this anthology, Yves Brunelle made available to the English reader and student the entire repertory of nineteenth century French fiction in Canada.\n\nThis book includes the full range of this literature in extract form, from Philippe Aubert de Gaspé, the Younger, The Treasure Seeker, or The Influence of a Book (1837) (Le chercheur de trésor ou l'influence d'un livre) to Pamphile LeMay's Blood and Gold (Sang et or) from his Contes vrais of 1899.\n\nHow often have we heard of Patrice Lacombe's The Family Farm (1846) (La terre paternelle) or Pierre-J.-O. Chauveau's Charles Guérin (1847)? These fables romances contain a wealth of folklore; they reflect the motivation and spirit of a whole people from its beginning on this continent in the seventeenth century to the end of the nineteenth.\n\nThe social history as preserved by French Canada's storytellers, romancers and novelists is more immediate and speaks to the reader in an unambiguous way that formal historians rarely achieve.\n\nIncludes works by Philippe Aubert de Gaspé, Amédée Papineau, Napoléon Aubin, Pierre Petitclair, Alphonse Poitras, L.-A. Oliver, Pierre-J.-O. Chauveau, Abbé Henri-Raymond Casgrain, Patrice Lacombe, Joseph-Charles Taché, and Joseph Marmette.\n\nTable of Contents\n\nIntroduction\n\nThe Stranger (The Legend of Rose Latulipe), Philippe Aubert de Gaspé, the Younger\n\nThe Man from Labrador, Philippe Aubert de Gaspé, the Younger\n\nCaroline: a Canadian Legend, Amédée Papineau\n\nPlan for the Canadian Republic, Napoléon Aubin\n\nA Labrador Adventure, Pierre Petitclair\n\nMy Uncle's Story, Alphonse Poitras\n\nThe Faithful Debtor, L.-A. Oliver\n\nCharles Guérin, Pierre-J.-O. Chauveau\n\nThe Sorceress, Abbé Henri-Raymond Casgrain\n\nThe Ancestral Farm, Patrice Lacombe\n\nForesters and Voyagers, Joseph-Charles Taché\n\nFrançois de Bienville, Joseph Marmette\n\nThe Last Cannon Ball, Joseph Marmette\n\nThe Roussis' Fire, Faucher de Saint-Maurice\n\nThe Werewolf, Benjamin Sulte\n\nOneille, Louis Fréchette\n\nTipite Vallerand, Louis Fréchette\n\nFor Our Native Land, Jules-Paul Tardivel\n\nBlood and Gold, Pamphile LeMay\n\nBorn in Montreal in 1927, Yves Brunelle attended École St. Gérard and D'Arcy McGee High School in Montreal. He received his BA in English from St. Francis Xavier University, his MA in Comparative Literature from Harvard University, and his PhD in English from the University of New Brunswick. He was a member of the Association of Canadian and Quebec Literatures and the Atlantic Canada Institute.\n\nBrunelle taught both in French and English, and was Program Director for Radio-Canada in Moncton and producer of \"Public Affairs\" for CBC Halifax. He then became a professor of English at St. Francis Xavier University.\n\nAmong his other publications are the translations of Angéline de Montbrun, by Laure Conan, and Un homme et son péché (The Woman and the Miser) by Claude-Henri Grignon. Professor Brunelle was an advisory editor for Harvest House's French Writers of Canada Series."
