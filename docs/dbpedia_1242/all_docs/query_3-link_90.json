        "text": "With the Harvest Festival time here I thought I would mention Robert Hawker author of the Cornish anthem “The song of Western Men” (1828) who created the church festival we know today in 1843, in the previous year he helped with the plight of my GG Grandfather Captain Edward Le Dain whose account was recorded by Hawker in his “Footprints of former men in far Cornwall”\n\nOn a ridge of rock, just left bare by the falling tide, stood a man, my own servant; he had come out to see his flock of ewes, and had found the awful wreck. There he stood, with two dead sailors at his feet, whom he had just drawn out of the water stiff and stark. The bay was tossing and seething with a tangle mass of rigging, sails, and broken fragments of ship; the billows rolled up yellow with corn, for the cargo of this vessel had been foreign wheat; and ever and anon there came up out of the water, as though stretched out with life, a human hand and arm. It was the corpse of another sailor drifting out to sea. “Is there no one alive?” was my first question to my man. “I think there is sir,” he said, “for just now I thought I heard a cry.” I made haste in the direction he pointed out and on turning a rock, just where a brook of fresh water fell towards the sea, there lay the body of a man in seaman’s garb. He had reached the water faint with thirst, but he was too much exhausted to swallow or drink. He opened his eyes at our voices, and as he saw me leaning over him in my cassock shaped dressing gown he sobbed, with a piteous cry, “Oh, mon père, mon père!” Gradually he revived, and when he had fully come to himself with the help of cordials and food, we gathered from him the mournful tale of his vessel and her wreck. He was a Jersey man by birth, and had been shipped at Malta (actually Rio de Janeiro, after recovering there from illness), on the homeward voyage of the vessel from the port of Odessa with corn. I had sent in for brandy, and pouring it down his throat when parishioner, Peter Barrow arrived. He assisted my request, in the charitable office of restoring the exhausted stranger…..Then ensued my interview with the rescued man. His name Le Dain. I found him refreshed, collected, and grateful. He told me his tale of the sea. The Captain and all the crew but himself were from Arbroath, Scotland. To that harbour the vessel belonged, she had been away on a two years voyage, employed in the Mediterranean trade, in Malta the Captain engaged a Portuguese cook, and to this man, as one link in a chain of causes, the loss of the vessel might be ascribed. He had been wounded in a street quarrel the night before the vessel sailed from Malta, and lay disabled and useless in his cabin throughout the homeward voyage. At Falmouth, whither they were bound for orders, the cook died. The captain and all the crew, except the cabin boy, went ashore to attend the funeral. During their absence the boy, handling in his curiosity the barometer, had broken the tube, and the whole of the quicksilver had run out. Had this instrument, the pulse of the storm been preserved, the crew would have received warning of the sudden and unexpected hurricane, and might of stood out to sea. Whereas, they were caught in the chops of the Channel, and thus, by this small incident, the vessel and the mariners found their fate on the remote headland in my lonely Parish. I caused Le Dain to relate in detail the closing events.\n\n“We received orders,” he said “At Falmouth to make for Gloucester to discharge”……”We rounded Lands End,” He said “that night all well, and came up the channel with a fair wind. The Captain turned in. It was my watch All at once, about nine at night it began to blow in one moment as if a storm had burst out by signal; the wind went mad; our canvas burst in bits. We reefed fresh sails; they went also. At last we were under bare poles. The Captain had turned out when the storm begain. He sent me forward to look for Lundy Light. I saw your cifff.” “I sung out land, I had hardly done so she struck with a blow, and stuck fast. Then the cabin boy sung out, “ All hands to the maintop,” and we all went up. The captain folded his arms, and stood by silent.”\n\nHere I asked him, anxious to know how they expressed themselves at such a time, “But what was said afterwards Le Dain?”\n\n“Not one word sir; only once, when the long boat went over, I said to the skipper, “Sir the boat is gone.” But he made no answer.”\n\nHow accurate Byron’s painting: Then shrieked the timid, and stood still the brave\n\n“At last there came a dreadful wave, mast top high, and away went the mast by the board, and we with it, into the sea. I gave myself up. I was the only man on the ship who could not swim, so where I fell into the water there I lay. I felt the waves beat me and send me on. At last I saw there was a rock under my hand. I clung on. Just then I saw Alick Kant one of our crew, swimming past. I saw him lay his hand on a rock, and I sung out, “Hold on, Alick!” but a wave rolled over and swept him away, and I never saw his face no more. I was beaten onward and onward among the rocks and tide, and at last I felt ground with my feet, I scrambled on. I saw the cliff, steep and dark above my head. I climbed up until I reached a kind of platform with grass,… I lay there for a long time and when I awoke it was just break of day. There was a little yellow flower just under my head, and when I saw that I knew I was on dry land.” This was a plant of the Bird’s foot clover, called in old times Our Lady’s Finger.\n\nThe nine remains of the nine crew were eventually found over the coming days and buried in the church yard with the ships figurehead making the grave.\n\nAt the end of about six weeks Le Dain left my house on his homeward way, a sadder and a richer man. Gifts had been proffered from many a hand, so that he was able to return to Jersey, with a happy and grateful mien, well clothed and with thirty pounds in his purse….three years afterward he returned to the place of his disaster accompanied by his Uncle, Sister, and affianced wife, and he had brought them that, in his own joyous words, “they might see the very spot of his great deliverance:” …Nor was the thankfulness of the sailor a barren feeling. Whenever afterwards the Vicar sought to purchase for his dairy a Jersey cow, the family and friends of Le Dain rejoiced to ransack the island until they had found the sleekest, loveliest, best of that beautiful breed, and it is to the gratitude of that poor seaman and stranger from a distant abode, that the herd of the glebe has long been famous in the land.\n\nStrange to say Le Dain has been twice shipwrecked since (at Sandyhook, NY, and the Caribbean) since his first peril; similar with loss of property, but escape with life: and he is now master of a vessel in the trade of the Levant (Eastern Mediterranean)\n\nNote: Edward Le Dain 1821-1885 named his son Edward Robert Hawker Le Dain 1854-?, he also named his house in Rouge Bouillon “Stuart Lodge” in memory of the colleagues he lost.\n\nFurther reading:\n\nRobert Stephen Hawker (By Angela Williams) – http://www.robertstephenhawker.co.uk/\n\nHawker Society – http://www.hawkersociety.org/\n\nArbroath timeline – http://www.arbroathtimeline.moonfruit.com/#/morwenstow/4530408841\n\nOld Vicarage Morwenstow Guest House – http://rshawker.co.uk/the-old-vicarage-bed-breakfast-and-self-catering-cottage/\n\nMorwenstow Church on wordpress – http://morwenstowchurch.wordpress.com/\n\nHawker of Morwenstow: Portrait of a Victorian Eccentric by Piers Brendon ISBN: 0224011227\n\nTreachery at Sharpnose Point by Jeremy Seal ISBN-10: 0156027054\n\n2 Responses »\n\nThe steam tug “Polka” sailed from St.Helier on Monday 15th of September 1850, with Captain Priaulx in command. Although the “Polka” was only a tugboat she carried fifty passengers and crew bound for St. Malo, she had been pressed into service in place of the “Superb” which was undergoing repairs in that port. When the tugboat was about halfway to her destination she sprung a leak and when some five miles off the Minquiers reef she began to sink. Having no pumps the master decided to hold his course and try to reach the reef.\n\nThe vessel was nearing Maitre Ile when she was almost swamped and the Captain with great coolness ordered passengers and crew to abandon the ship, the two lifeboats were lowered and as they pulled away from the ship she disappeared beneath the waves. Arriving safely on the Maitre Ile, the survivors that night light a fire hoping to attract someone to their rescue. The next day running short of food, and no rescue in sight, the Mate, John Fleming rowed out to sea and drew the attention of the SS “Southwestern”. They were picked up and landed in France later that night and in gratitude to the Captain and his crew for their gallant bearing, the passengers made a collection among themselves.\n\nReports were sent back to Jersey and the people of St. Helier were waiting to welcome back Captain Priaulx and his gallant crew. On September the 17th the steamer “Superb” now fully repaired left St.Malo with sixty passengers and crew, among the passengers were several survivors from the earlier wreck. On approaching the Minquiers, some of these passengers asked Captain Priaulx to show them where the “Polka” sank, rather reluctantly he agreed and the Mate, John Fleming steered the vessel through the eastern passage, only to strike a rock known as “La Pointue du Blanc Roc” which ripped open the steamer and she foundered.\n\nAs before two lifeboats were lowered but this time there was a great panic and neither the master nor the mate did very much to help. The first boat capsized after the passengers and crew crowded into it, the second one also capsized upon a large lady jumping into it from the deck of the vessel, and most of the twenty persons who were in these boats were drowned. Help was on its way, at 10 a.m. a distress signal was hoisted on Fort Regent and the cutter “Jupiter” immediately set sail for the wreck. At 11.30 a.m. the “Collier” newly arrived in the roads from Shoreham, with Captain Doke in command, also made for the Minquiers.\n\nOn arrival at the wreck, Captain Doke found the “Superb” left high an dry on the rock and those persons, including Captain Priaulx, who were still on the vessel’s deck were taken off safely. This second wreck had taken place only 400 yards from that of the “Polka”, but some twenty persons had lost their lives. The “Jupiter” rescued M. Finch, a seaman, Philip Mollet and Philip Cunning, the ship’s carpenter and recovered the body of Mrs Gosset.The other survivors were brought back to St. Helier by the “Collier”.\n\nAt the inquest on the bodies of Mr Issac Gosset and Mrs Gosset (Nee Julia Nicolle) the jury was composed of P.Hemery, J.Godfray, George Ph., Benest, J.Ph.Aubin, Chas Sullivan, P. Bichard, Ph.Rive, F.Le Maistre, Ph.Arthur, Thos.Gray, Nicolas Robillard and Ph.Jenne. Evidence was given by Joseph Johnson, Engineer, Philip Amy, seaman Philip Mollet, seaman Edw.Gaudin, 2nd Mate, Thomas Hamon and John Le Riche, fisherman, Mons. Achille Quera, Henry Lomas and James Harris, passengers and others. The jury brought in a verdict that the wreck of the “Superb” was the result of culpable imprudence on the part of Captain Priaulx, in taking the vessel in a dangerous place, without knowing it, out of its ordinary course on its way from St. Malo to Jersey, and Mr John Fleming who was Mate on board the said steamer, was also guilty of imprudence, in attempting to take the said vessel by that course. Besides Mr Gosset and wife, other persons who lost their lives were:- Mr.Rattenbury, Mr Jackson, his son and daughter, Mr Willis and his niece , Henry Bellot, cook, W.Palmer, Chauffeur, Wm.Craney, cabin boy, Mr Sedgwick, Mr Pinson, Mr Nott of Gorey, Mrs Baker and child, Miss Fanny Price, Miss Watson, Miss Wright and an unidentified gentleman. Five bodies were recovered. Forty persons were saved namely:- J.Terry and his son, J.Hamel of St.Malo, Col.Brock, Achille Quera of Argentan, Geo. Bowerman of Jersey, Dr. Harral, Emile Peigney of Paris, —- Le Gros of St.Malo, John Currier of Birmingham, Benjamin Johnson of London, Robert T. Montieth, Caroline Hambly, Charlotte Maule, Charles Bastin of Paris, G. Pinch of London, Ellen Willis of London (er Uncle and sister were drowned), Alfred De Bailieu of St.Servan, J.B.Hamilton, his wife and two children, Mrs Norman and her daughter, James Harris of Jersey, Henry Lomas, the stewardess (not named), John Frost, William Johnson (engineer), John Steward (seaman), John Bellot (steward), Charles Amy (seaman), Edward Gaudin (second mate), Philip Cunning (carpenter), Philip Mollet (seaman), W.Cox, Nicolas Dupont (pilot) of Guernsey and the Captain and the Mate.\n\nFour persons who had been saved from the earlier wreck of the “Polka” were aboard the “Superb” and were lost in the second sinking. On their return to the Island, Captain Priaulx and John Fleming had a charge of “criminally causing death” laid against them and they were not allowed to sail again, although John Fleming was back at sea not long after. Later the boilers of both vessels salvaged and brought to the Island, that of the “Polka” was installed in the new steamer “Don” of 24 tons, and that of the “Superb” was used to power the 84 ton “Rose”. Both vessels were built by F.C.Clarke of West Park, and were the first steamers to be built in Jersey. Thomas Rose was the owner of these new ships. At the time of the wreck Thomas Rose owned the “Superb” while the tug “Polka” was owned by a company of fifteen persons, mostly shipowners of course.\n\nThe Wreck of the “polka” steam tug: report in the Jersey Times, Friday, September 20th, 1850\n\n“We have the painful task of recording the loss of the “Polka” steam tug, of this Island; On Monday morning last she left t.Helier, at 11 o’clock, for St.Malo, in the place of the Superb, then undergoing repair, and had about fifty passengers on board. When some six or seven miles this side of Les Minquiers, it was found that she had sprung a leak, and was rapidly filling. She had no pumps and under the circumstances of the case Captain Priaulx, who was in command, deemed it prudent neither to put back for St.Helier nor to go on to St.Malo, but resolved to run the vessel direct for Les Minquiers, and when within about a quarter of a mile off the eastern most rock (Maitre Ile) she was still making water with fearful rapidity, and her fires being out, commenced landing his passengers in the boats- one belonging to the “Polka”, and the other to the “Superb”, which latter Captain Priaulx had the meritorious foresight to take with him, a precaution which in all probability was the preservation of many lives as no sooner was the “Polka” finally cleared of her ? Human freight (with nearly all passengers baggage) than she sank and totally disappeared in the water, as it was high tide at the time. Everyone was safely landed on the rock; It being about one o’clock in the afternoon.\n\nThe “Southwestern” steamer, Captain James Goodridge senior, left St.Helier on Tuesday at noon for St.Malo. At between 2 and half past 2 o’clock her look out, a seaman named John Williams observed a number of persons on Maitre Ile, and a small boat pulling out with a white (improvised for the occasion, of very delicate material). This being reported to Captain Goodridge, he by means of his glass made out the persons on the rock, the boat, and the ensign and a white sheet flying as a signal of distress. All hands were called, sail was taken in, and the “south western” bore down towards the boat, which they found with Mr.Fleming (Mate of the “Polka”) and one of the “Polka’s” crew in her, they having volunteered to put off on the lookout for the “South-western”. These and the boat she took on board, then laid in close to the rock, lowered her boats, and took Captain Priaulx, the rest of his crew, and all his passengers, off the rock with the baggage and a small dog: and then proceeded to St.Malo, where she arrived in total safety.\n\nThe shipwrecked Captain, crew and passengers were thus on Les Minquiers for a full 24 hours, living on two 4 lb loaves which they had on board, and some biscuits and water supplied to them by the two or three poor fishermen resident in huts on the rock, who showed them the up most hospitality. During the night they kindled a blazing fire, without, however, attracting the notice, which they coveted; the materials for the fire being a quantity of fisherman’s baskets and driftwood found among the rocks. The persons whose lives were preserved subscribed ten pounds for the inhabitants of the rocks, and 10 shillings each to the “Polka’s” crew, and at St.Malo presented a bracelet to a lady passenger to whom had been committed the distribution of the rations.\n\nOn the “South Western’s” arrival at St.Malo Captain Goodridge found the harbour and place in a state of great excitement and anxiety, the inhabitants having heard from a cutter, which had arrived from Jersey, that the “Polka” had left St.Helier for their port at the usual hour on Monday. Their delight on the safe arrival of all the passengers in the “South Western” was therefore extreme.\n\nThe “Polka” we regret to state, was uninsured. We with pleasure give insertion to the following letter on the subject of the “Polka” wreck:-”\n\nTo the editor of the “Jersey Times”.\n\nSir, — Allow me to take advantage of your widely circulated journal for the purpose of contradicting the reports which are currently afloat as to the cause of the above unfortunate catastrophe, which it is asserted would not have occurred had not Captain Priaulx touched her on a rock in trying to “cut” a passage through the Minquiers; and in such false assertions would if uncontradicted, prove highly detrimental to the good name Captain Priaulx has hithero claimed by the long experience, and personal knowledge of all dangers surrounding our coast, I avail upon your medium for stating that the accident occurred solely from the vessel having sprung a leak, and had it not been for the judgement of Captain Priaulx and his mate, Mr John Fleming, who ran her close into la Maitre Ile (on which every passenger was landed safely) the consequences might have been of a different nature.\n\nAs to Captain Priaulx trying to cut a passage, when he had at the time upwards of fifty souls under his charge, it is utterly false, for I may merely mention that the principals of his commandership are of the “older school” which is to proceed by known and safe passages, and not for cutting out new ones; which principal has without doubt met the approbation of those who have had the pleasure of crossing with him, a subscription being now on foot for presenting him with a testimonial for his long services on this station and which already figures with the names of our influential merchants.\n\nI must not omit to mentioin that the passengers impressed their grateful thanks to Captain Atkinson and also to Mr John Fleming, for their arduous exertions, in organising the disembarking of the passengers on to the rock, Mr Fleming not allowing a single male passenger in the boat until every lady had been landed in safety.\n\nI remain Frederick ?\n\nThe following is a list of the passengers on board the “Polka” at the time of the wreck:\n\nMessrs.
