        "text": "Col. Gabriel Montegut, a prominent resident of Houma and Terrebonne, died in March 1924, leaving no direct heirs, but a legacy of political and civic accomplishment.\n\nThe account of his life which follows is told almost entirely in his own words, taken from a letter he wrote to a New Orleans cousin in 1917 and from a speech he wrote just months before his death at age 85.\n\nHelen Wurzlow, who published part of the Montegut speech in her history of Houma and Terrebonne, said the retired bank cashier owned a house and small farm at Main and St. Charles streets, the present site of Terrebonne High School.\n\n\"I have given 56 years of my life to the service of and, as the records will show, to the welfare of the people of Houma and Terrebonne,\" Montegut wrote in the speech.\n\n\"I first clerked about two years. I then established a collection bureau with my office in the tailoring establishment of my friend, August Wurzlow. In October, 1875, I established the Montegut Insurance Agency, now managed by my popular young friend and partner, Jasper K. Wright. In 1876 I founded a partnership with my late lamented friend, Aubin Bourg, under the name of Bourg and Montegut. We did a large notarial business. We sold a quantity of cypress swamp for the account of the estate of R.R. Barrow and others.\n\n\"We broke up and sold in small tracts to successful farmers eight plantations -- Semple Plantation adjoining Bourg, the Wade estate just above and adjoining Houma, the Smith Plantation on Little Caillou, the Rural Retreat on Bayou Terrebonne; Mechanicsville, a short distance from Houma, a farm of 35 acres on the old Radical Ridge for a colored school; Louise, a part of Argyle Plantation; and a part of the Halfway Plantation, all of record in the Clerk of Court's Office in Houma ...\n\n\"In 1872 I was appointed tax collector by (disputed Louisiana governor) John McEnery. I did not enjoy the emoluments of the office because of the Kellogg usurpation. I qualified nevertheless, with my friends, J.M. Dupont, Victor Buron, Euphrosin Hotard, on my bond.\n\n\"I was appointed superintendent of the U. S. Mint in New Orleans by Grover Cleveland in 1885.\n\n\"I was an elector on the presidential ticket of Cleveland and Steveson. I was appointed chief deputy naval officer by my friend, J. B. Snyder during the second administration of Grover Cleveland.\n\n\"I was candidate for state treasurer on the ticket with McEnery and Wickliffe. And lastly, at the urgent request of the promoters of the People's Bank in Houma, I abandoned a promising career in New Orleans, and, at the age of 58 years, accepted the cashiership of the bank.\"\n\nMontegut's will, Wurzlow reported, left to Ella Murray, his old and faithful servant, the sum of $1,000, three cows, one young heifer, all poultry on the place, and the pigs.\n\nThe will ended with the following sentence: \"I bow reverently before the Great Omni-potent Power That controls everything.\"\n\nGabriel Montegut had summarized his family history in a 1917 letter to his cousin, Gustave Pitot, in New Orleans. That letter, because of its wealth of historical information, was published 1918, in the first issue of the Louisiana Historical Quarterly.\n\n\"My dear Gus,\" Montegut began, \"I am glad you contemplate writing up the genealogy of our family. You will find it exceedingly interesting. Let me tell you what I know about them.\n\n\"Practically, the Creole families of Louisiana all descend from the old French nobility. Before the Revolution, the great mass of the French people could procure no pass-ports, therefore could not emigrate. They had no family names. For instance, one was a baker named Pierre. He was known as Pierre le Boulanger, which, later on, evolved into the Boulanger family. Another named Jean, lived at the foot of a bridge. He was known as Jean du pont,- whence evolved the Dupont family ...\n\n\"After the (French) Revolution they flocked to ... Louisiana on account of the French language and Catholic religion ... Many of that class were descendants of Serfs who took the names of the Seigneurs, their masters ...\n\n\"The Monteguts are of Norman origin. At the invasion of Italy by the Normans ... many of them came to, and remained in Italy and mixed with the Latin blood. This accounts for the blue eyes and blondes found in the north of Italy and numerously in Sicily. Shakespeare ... there found the data for his ëRomeo and Juliet,' representing respectively, the Montaigues and the Capulets ...\n\n\"From Italy some of them went to the south of France, which, accounts for our family at Armngnac near Toulouse .\n\n\"Our great grand-father Dr. Jos. Montegut came to Louisiana about 1760 and married Francoise De Lisle Dupart, a Creole, whose parents were also natives. Her mother was Arnoult, (DeLisle Arnoult) and it is from the Arnoults that we are related to the Waggamans. One of the Duparts was burned at the stake, in the wars with the Natchez (Indians). The Duparts, DeLisle, Arnoult, St. Amant and Waggamans, all related to us, were prominent colonists.\n\n\"I recall a day, many years ago, as I was walking leisurely on Canal street. I met my lamented friend, Henry Castellanos. After greeting me with his usual warmth, he said, ëGabe, I want to write up the Charity Hospital, can you give me any interesting data on the subject?'\n\n\"I answered, I knew very little about its early history. He said, ëAh, you Creoles, you are alike. Why, my dear friend, your great grand-father, Don Jose Montegut. (so called in Spanish days) was the first resident physician of the Charity hospital.'\n\n\"Our uncle Jos. Rofignac, who was Mayor of New Orleans four terms, from 1820 to 1828, married his daughter. Uncle Edgard was Mayor of New Orleans in 1844, and clerk of the Criminal Court several terms.\n\n\"I took issue with Prof. Fortier some years ago when he wrote in his history of Louisiana that Etienne DeBore was the first American Mayor of New Orleans. I told him, he was not. That my great grand-father, Jacques Pitot was the first American Mayor of New Orleans. That DeBore was the French Mayor, a ëhold over' at the time of the cession, and that, when the municipal government of New Orleans was organized under American auspices, Governor Claiborne appointed Jacques Pitot, Mayor, therefore the first American Mayor ...\n\n\"There is a good sprinkling of military blood in our veins. My maternal grand-father, your father's cousin, Alphonse Desmare, belonged to Napoleon's Guard of honor, and Napoleon selected them from the old families ...\n\n\"Our uncle Remond Montegut, commanded an artillery Co. at the battle of New Orleans. Edw. Livingston and his wife were my father's God Father and God Mother.\n\n\"I desire to mention also that our grand-father (Montegut) established a sugar plantation in the Parish of Plaquemines and named it ëSt. Sophie,' after our dear tante Sophie, our grand-mother's sister. There is a settlement and post office there now known as St. Sophie. I am pleased to mention this, to show that our family felt an interest in the sugar industry when in its infancy. Our grand-father died in 1814, so you see, that is a long time ago.\n\n\"Referring to our Civil War, our family was Confederate to the core, none more so ...\n\nMontegut closed the letter with: \"Ton ami de coeur, GABI.\" (Loosely translated, \"Your friend of the heart, Gabi.\")\n\nNeither the 1917 letter nor the 1924 speech addresses whether the lower Terrebonne town of Montegut takes its name from Gabriel or one of his relatives.\n\nThat is a question for another time.\n\nThe Courier is looking for your old photographs and the memories that go with them to run in this weekly feature.
