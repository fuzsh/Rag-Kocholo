Oliver's The Faithful Debtor, Pierre-J. O. Chauveau's Charles Guérin, Abbé Henri-Raymond Casgrain's The Sorceress, Patrice Lacombe's The Ancestral Farm, Joseph-Charles Taché's Foresters and Voyageurs, Joseph Marmette's François de Bienville and The Last Cannon Ball, Faucher de Saint-Maurice's The Roussis' Fire, Benjamin Sulte's The Werewolf, Louis Fréchette's Oneille and Tipite Vallerand, Jules-Paul Tardivel's For Our Native Land, and Pamphile LeMay's Blood and Gold.\n\nYves Brunelle (Author, Editor)\n\nBorn in Montreal in 1927, Yves Brunelle attended Ecole St. Gerard and D’Arcy McGee High School in Montreal. He received his BA in English from St. Francis Xavier University, his MA in Comparative Literature from Harvard University, and his PhD in English from the University of New Brunswick. He is a member of the Association of Canadian and Quebec Literatures and the Atlantic Canada Institute.\n\nBrunelle has taught both French and English, and was Program Director for Radio-Canada in Moncton and producer of “Public Affairs” for CBC Halifax.
