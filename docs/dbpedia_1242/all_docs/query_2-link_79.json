        "text": "2017 Armelle et Jean-Michel Molin, Fixin Blanc VV Les Ormeaux\n\nA wine raised in a jar (amphora) with plenty of skin-contact it seems. The label proudly announcing Vin Biologique! A robust cork.\n\nPlenty of colour; a little golden and not with 100% clarity. The nose is heavy with the aromas of grape and is a little bready – not elegant but definitely not a turn-off either. Mouthfilling, and with a nice fresh wave of flavour that holds quite well in the finish. There’s plenty of concentration here. You may be forgiven for not being sure whether this is chardonnay or not – so forget ‘Fixin!’ – but this remains a more than tasty glass for all that, one that I’ll happily take a refill of!\n\nRebuy – Maybe\n\n1985 Guillemard-Dupont, Pommard\n\nA domaine in Meloisey at this time. The cork breaks in more than one place, but I just about kept all of the parts on the corkscrew…\n\nThis is a big and open nose – the age is showing with its ‘forest floor’ of wet leaves plus a certain sweetness from the fruit – if you like the smell of older wines, you’ll love this! Mouth-filling, complex, still some layers of oak too. There’s a sweetness to the flavour and generally speaking, this seems a robust specimen of an ’85 – perfectly clichéd Pommard, if you like. The weight and length of finishing flavour is on another level to the Fixin. For what it is – bravo – drinking well over three days (kept in the fridge after opening) and not a hint of brett developed!\n\nRebuy – Yes (Luckily, I think I’ve more!)\n\n2009 Gilles Bouton, St.Aubin 1er En Créot\n\nI still have a few of these handily-sized 50cl bottles – in this case still drunk over two nights. A robust cork.\n\nOn first opening, this is a strange blend of sweet fruit and more herbed notes that might imply under-ripeness – both in the flavours and aromas. Yet this is a wine that pulls together very well with aeration – I’m sure it’s still going to improve in the cellar – assuming it takes on the aerated character rather than exacerbating the first impressions! Slowly coming together with some moderate sweetness of red fruit and a less forward herbacity; here is a wine that seamlessly transitions from ‘something to drink’ to a wine where I’m looking forward to a top-up.\n\nRebuy – Yes"
