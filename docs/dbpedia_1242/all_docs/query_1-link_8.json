Now,with the abolition of thisprotection in 1846,therecamean unparallelled financial failure in milling. Andwiththeendof theBritish railway boom in thesame yearcame abysmal losses forthetimber merchants whose investments hadbeenbased ontheall-timehighprices of the previous years. TheGovernor General, LordElgin,described to the Colonial Secretary how Peel's Billof 1846drives thewholeoftheproduce downtheNewYorkchannels of communication, destroying the revenue whichCanadaexpected to derive fromcanaldues, andruiningat oncemill-owners, forwarders, andmerchants. The consequence is thatprivateproperty is unsaleable in Canada, andnot a shilling canbe raised onthecreditof theProvince. We areactually reduced to the disagreeable necessity of payingall publicoffleers, fromthe GovernorGeneral downwards, in debentures whicharenotexchangeable at par. x Because theylivedalmost entirely onwhattheirownfarms produeed ,the French-Canadian habitants werenot asgravelystricken bytherepeal of theCornLawsasweretheiropposite numbers in *This paper was read atameeting oftheHistory Association ofMontreal, heldatthe Chateau deRamezay, November 17,1064. aSir A.

Thepoliticians among them-traditional Tories whohadjustlost political control ofthecolony forthefirsttime since 1791-reasoned (andcorrectly) thattheyhadlostthegeneral electionof 1847 becauseof the French vote.
