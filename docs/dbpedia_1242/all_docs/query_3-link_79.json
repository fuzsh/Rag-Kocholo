See the discussion of this medal at Todd, op. cit., p. 114, with an illustration of the reverse:\n\n“Another medal pictures the crown of Agilulfus, the ancient Lombard king (592-615), a circlet of gold and jewels over an iron ring, said to have been forged from one of the nails that had pierced Christ’s hand. The inscription reads AGILVLFVS. GRATIA. DEI. GLORIOSVS. REX. The crown was brought from the cathedral of Monza to Milan by an escort of the Guard and of citizens of Monza. [Citing Le Moniteur, 1 June 1805.] Napoleon was following in the footsteps of Charlemagne who in 774 had conquered the Lombards and assumed the title ‘King of the Lombards.’ As he placed the crown on his head, Napoleon spoke the traditional words of the Lombard ceremony, ‘God has given it to me; let him beware who touches it.’ [In French, ‘Dieu me la donne, gare à qui la touche.’] Napoleon was now Emperor of France and King of Italy.”\n\nI have amended my post above from earlier today, describing my recently-purchased Napoleon coronation medal commemorating his 1805 crowning as King of Italy in Milan, to add a reference to a new English-language catalog of Napoleonic medals that I discovered late this afternoon. The additional citation is to David Thomason Alexander, A Napoleonic Medal Primer (2022), No. 52 (discussed at p. 78; ill. p. 79) (available at https://nnp.wustl.edu/library/book/618630). The book, which was published last September, is available for viewing and download at the Newman Numismatic Portal, at the stated link. One can also purchase a hard copy on Amazon for $45. It contains 187 color illustrations of Napoleonic medals, including this one of the Italian coronation medal at p. 79:\n\nSo far, I'm finding the book to be very useful and informative. And the price can't be beaten!\n\nThe author, who writes for Coin World (he writes the monthly “The Research Desk” column), and has published other books on medals, is apparently quite well-known, although I'm not familiar with him. This is what appears to be a press release in the 12.25.2022 issue of The E-Sylum, announcing the book:\n\nhttps://www.coinbooks.org/v25/esylum_v25n52a04.html\n\n\"Medals recording the meteoric career of Napoleon Bonaparte have fascinated collectors for more than two centuries. The Monnaie de Paris has produced the majority of existing Napoleonic pieces and continues striking many today, including many such later issues as the 1840 Retour des Cendres and the 2021 Bicentenary of the Emperor's death. In all this time there has never been a comprehensive English language survey of the Napoleonic series to introduce the American collector to this fascinating subject. This book does not pretend to include every Napoleonic medal ever issued, but presents a survey to aid beginning or advanced collectors wishing to explore this fascinating field.\n\nThe title, The Napoleonic Medal Primer, has been chosen to express what this book is and is not. Napoléon Bonaparte (born 1769, died 1821) bestrode the world of his day like a colossus and left behind one of history's most extensive medallic fossil records which has continued to grow centuries after his death on the remote South Atlantic island of Saint Helena.\n\nThis book will offer an introduction to and survey of medals of Napoleonic interest from the French Revolution to modern times, and is directed in large measure toward American collectors. The term Primer, pronounced Primmer in the UK and Pry-mer in the U.S., has been chosen to avoid suggesting that this is an encyclopedic coverage of all Napoleonic material, which would include significantly more medals than can be covered here.\n\nThis work is initially built on medals that the author has personally collected, examined, cataloged and recorded since the early 1950s, in other words, a record of what is known to exist. The text is directed toward but not certainly limited to the particular needs of both beginning and experienced collectors, including a basic medallic vocabulary, to present and clarify the use of terms that often baffle collectors coming over from the world of coins. Particular attention will be paid to clarifying the restrike issue, contrasting Paris Mint practice with the limited and restrictive American understanding of this troublesome term.\n\nSimilarly, the critical role of PATINAS used on Copper and Bronze medals over the centuries will be addressed, along with description of the all-important EDGE MARKINGS of Paris Mint medals and their relation to dating\n\nAuthor David Thomason Alexander became interested in medals in the 1950s. He founded Medal Collectors of America in 1998 as the first American organization devoted to collectors of U.S. and world art and commemorative medals. His earlier works include American Art Medals 1909-1995 (American Numismatic Society, 1995) and Medals of the Hall of Fame for Great Americans... an Under-utilized Resource in American Medallic Art (Newman Numismatic Portal, 2019).\n\nASIN : B0BLCQ5R9N\n\nPublisher : Independently published (November 2, 2022)\n\nLanguage : English\n\nPaperback : 189 pages\n\nISBN-13 : 979-8359099264\n\nItem Weight : 1.24 pounds\n\nDimensions : 8.5 x 0.45 x 11 inches\n\nAuthor Alexander adds:\n\n\"It is an endless question why this has not been attempted before in modern times... In describing his pioneer work with U.S, Presidential Inaugural Medals, the late Joe Levine stated his belief that the American collector shied away from open-ended medal areas, vastly preferring series with clear beginnings and endings. Hopefully we'll attract collectors motivated by this idea!\n\n\"Thanks are due to Lianna Spurrier, our compositor and layout genius, to whose marvelous skill we owe Napoleon's success!\"\n\nFor more information, or to order, see:\n\nA Napoleonic Medal Primer Paperback (https://www.amazon.com/Napoleonic-Medal-Primer-Thomason-Alexander/dp/B0BLCQ5R9N/ref=sr_1_1)\n\nTo read on the Newman Numismatic Portal, see:\n\nA Napoleonic Medal Primer (https://nnp.wustl.edu/library/book/618630).\"\n\nEven those uninterested in Napoleonic medals might enjoy this excerpt from the introduction to the book, at p. 8:\n\n\"When I obtained my first medals in the early 1950s, I quickly learned that no medal catalogs or references were available in Miami, Florida, or anywhere else to assist a young collector. There was one active dealer in town who presided over the Hobby Shop in the Shoreland Arcade, the three-story stump of what was to have been a 22-story office tower begun just as the great Florida Boom collapsed in 1926.\n\nHis shop handled model planes and cars, stamps and such coin books as then existed. The coins themselves occupied the left-hand row of glass counters in the shadow of a magnificent safe which announced in imposing gold-leaf lettering FREDERICK A. NEWMAN – PHILATELIST, NUMISMATIST. I learned that he had been an active coin dealer during the commemorative boom of the 1930s, and had many engaging eccentricities including an epic distaste for all other coin dealers!\n\nHe had treasures: five-cent, 25-cent and 69-cent “junk boxes.” With money raised from selling the Miami Daily News and returning two-cent and five-cent deposit bottles, my brother John and I bought scores of great things. One day a glint of gold caught my eye, digging toward it I found a bright golden piece about the size of a nickel bearing a laureate head with forbidding expression and legend NAPOLEON EMPEREUR.\n\nA million boyish thoughts came boiling up! Could it be?? Might it actually be… a Gold coin??? What’s this on the reverse? A laurel wreath enclosing JETON… a mere card game gambling piece, brass… Negligible value then and now, but enough to launch years of questioning and research. “From tiny acorns…”\n\nMy first French medal came from the 69-cent junk box soon after. . . .\"\n\nEdited April 6, 2023 by DonnaML\n\nAnother Napoleon medal; I think I like the reverse design the best of all the ones I have. Perhaps I'm wrong -- unlike my son, I'm not an art historian! -- but to me it seems almost like it could be something from the 1930s.\n\nFrance, AE Medal, First Empire, Mont Blanc School of Mines, 1805 (original strike, no hallmark). Obv. by Bertrand Andrieu: Laureate head right, NAPOLEON - EMPEREUR; beneath truncation in two lines, DENON DIR. | ANDRIEU F. [fecit] / Rev. by Nicolas Guy Antoine Brenet: A figure of an old man of colossal size, personifying the mountain of Mont Blanc; he appears in a crouching attitude, blind from age, with his bald head penetrating and capped with clouds; his right hand grasps a gigantic rock, under which appears a cavern with miners working within; his left hand, in repose, lies across his left thigh; water flows from rocks and from his long beard to feed rivers at the base of the mountain, where his left foot rests; in exergue in two lines, ECOLE DES MINES DU | MONT BLANC; above exergue on raised edge of ground line, BRENET F. to left and DENON D. to right / Edge: “34” written in old ink on edge (probably a reference to the medal’s catalog number in Laskey 1818, infra). 40 mm., 38.52 g.

Purchased from Münzenhandlung Wolfgang Rittig, Schwelm, North Rhine-Westphalia, Germany, April 2023 (with old German-language coin ticket from a previous owner, with purchase date 1971).*\n\nThe names of Brenet and Denon on the reverse can be seen only when viewing the medal from its edge. This photo shows the names, and also gives an idea of the medal's three-dimensionality:\n\nThe inked number on the edge probably represents the medal's Laskey number (also used in Zeitz), based on a list of the Napoleon Medals available for purchase at the Monnaie de Paris (i.e., the Paris Mint) in 1815:\n\n*This medal commemorates the establishment of a school of mineralogy in the Department of Mont Blanc. According to Zeitz (see p. 94), the medal’s reverse design was announced on 12 Feb, 1802, the die was completed by Brenet in May 1805, and a specimen was presented to Napoleon’s Council of Mines on 16 Feb. 1806. Both Laskey and Millingen suggest that the reverse design was inspired by the famous 11-meter high 16th century “Apennine Colossus” statue by the Flemish sculptor Giambologna (Jean de Boulogne), located in Tuscany, intended as a personification of the Apennine Mountains. See https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apennine_Colossus and the photos of the Colossus at that page, e.g. the following:\n\nThere is undeniably a resemblance.\n\nFinally, if anyone can decipher the lines on the old coin ticket next to which I've placed red dots, I would certainly appreciate it:\n\nEdited April 24, 2023 by DonnaML"
