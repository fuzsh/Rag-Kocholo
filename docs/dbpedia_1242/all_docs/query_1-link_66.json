EditedbyJAMES HILLER and•'EX•.R •.AR¾.Toronto,Universityof TorontoPress,•98x. Pp.viii, a88. $ao.oo cloth,$7.5opaper. Themajority oftheessays inthiscollection have been published elsewhere and in thisrespectthe editorshaveoffereduslittle that canbe termed'new.' Rather, theyhavebroughttogether aselection ofworks onavariety oftopics in Newfoundlandhistory,added a few original pieces,and refocused our attention onanimportantandoftenoverlooked areaof Canadian history. The purposeof this book, accordingto the editors,is to providea cross-section of currentworkin Newfoundlandstudies. The primarythemeis 'thetransition fromthepurelymaritime economy ofthenineteenth century to the mixedoceanicand inland resource economyof the twentiethcentury.' Otherthemes emerge,including thepolitical andeconomic ascendency of St John's, the role of sectarianism and corruption in localpolitics, andthe importance of Newfoundland's uniqueinternational position, itsdependence onforeigntrade,andthenotalways cordialrelationship withBritain. PeterNearyexamines theFrenchandAmericanshorequestions andshows how they becameentangledwith the expansion of StJohn'scommercial interests. In 'The Railwayand LocalPolitics in Newfoundland,•87o-•9o•,' JamesHiller describes Newfoundland's railwaypolicyasa hopefulcurefor domestic economic ills.Unfortunately, it produced a falseprosperity atbest, creating political controversy andlargedeficits, butfewjobs. Several otherareasareexplored.ShannonRyanexamines thenineteenthcenturysaltfish tradeand findsthe seeds of itscollapse in increased world competition and unfavourable tariff conditions. R.M. Elliottdiscusses the political situation inthe•9aoswhichproduced theHollisWalkerEnquiry. Ian McDonaldcatalogues the riseandfall of W.F. CoakerandtheFishermen's Protective Union,andNearysurveys provincial politics inNewfoundland upto •97•. Perhaps the twomostimpressive essays are thoseby DavidAlexanderin whichhetraces thedevelopment of Newfoundland's economy uptothe•95os. Expansion of the traditionalfishingindustryhaddroppedoff by •89oand effortsweremadetodevelop alongNorthAmericanlines,withanimported developmental policy.This policyfailedbecause Newfoundlandlackedthe capital, theindustrial tradition,andthedomestic marketneeded toabsorb the massive outputrequiredforindustrial development. In thetwentieth century, he argues,Newfoundlandwasunableto escape from its dependence on foreigntradeand,like Canada,sought largesurpluses of tradeoverseas to offsetitsdeficitwith North America.By the endof World War n thewhole foundation wascrumbling underfallingprices, increased competition, andthe inability of therestof theworldtoresume pre-wartradepatterns. The result wasNewfoundland's integrationintotheNorth Americaneconomy. REVIEWS 97 Thisisinnowayacomprehensive history ofNewfoundland, norisit meant tobe.Whilethedefeatof Confederation in a869iswelldocumented, thereis little referenceto the other negotiations with Ottawa,includingthe final successful ones.Moreover, little attention isdirected towardsLabrador, either asa troublesome boundary disputeor for itsrole,realor imagined, in the development ofNewfoundland's economy. Butthese areminorpoints. In the context of this collection it would be unfair to criticize for what has been left out.Eachessay stands byitself,andasa wholethisbookmakes a significant contribution toourunderstanding of Newfoundland history.
