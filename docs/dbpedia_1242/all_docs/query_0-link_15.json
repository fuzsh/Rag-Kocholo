This paper explains how political satire is deeply entrenched in French culture and how it has been used as a democratization and liberating tool by a society eager to counterbalance the existing religious establishment. Similarly, it then addresses satire in the Muslim world and underlines that, instead of being considered a tool of the weak against the powerful, it is perceived as a neo-colonial manifestation of an exogenously imposed political order that ostracizes the citizen from his legitimate religious belief. Instead of a liberating instrument, it is perceived as attacking the foundation of a religion that many see as their refuge against authoritarian elites. This paper then analyses the historical evolution of Islamic political activism. After highlighting the existence of satire and religious representation in Islam in some of its earliest societal orders, this paper argues that the Muslim community under the leadership of its Ulema has been fractured into a range of different scholastic interpretations of Islam resulting into different acceptation of liberal civic orders. The reaction towards Charlie Hebdo and the strong/weak condemning or silent/vocal approbation are representative of their contamination by radicalism. This paper finally demonstrates that the rejection of satire is symptomatic of the incomplete evolution of the state and the weakness of national and transnational institutions. Addressing the reforming of Muslim institutions in France itself, this paper argues that there is no incompatibility between Islam and a liberal republican order guaranteeing freedom of expression and satire.\n\nMazur, N.

Baranov’s decision to omit Voltaire’s comparison between the French national character and champagne, encouraged Russian poets to introduce new analogies to fill the gap. Thanks to this competition in versifi cation skills, champagne gained a wide spectrum of symbolic, political and poetic connotations, described in our article.\n\nBaraboi, Myroslav. \"Ukrainian Historiography of French-Canadian nationalism: the Current Status and the Prospects for Researching the Issue.\" American History & Politics Scientific edition, no. 8 (2019): 40–46. http://dx.doi.org/10.17721/2521-1706.2019.08.04.\n\nFull text\n\nAbstract:\n\nThe article are investigated the domestic historiography of French-Canadian nationalism. The article analyzes approaches to French-Canadian nationalism, both by researchers in independent Ukraine and by representatives of the Ukrainian diaspora in Canada. It is noted that the domestic historiography of the French-Canadian question can be divided into four directions: the genesis of French-Canadian nationalism; research about the status of the French language in Quebec and Canada in general; the relations between Quebec and the Federation Center; «Quiet Revolution» in Quebec and the French-Canadian national issue at present. It is established that in the research of French-Canadian nationalism in domestic historiography, some researchers focus not only on the historical aspects of this issue, but also on political and legal ones. This approach from the standpoint of theory of state and law allows us better understand some aspects of French-Canadian nationalism. It has been found that most researchers focus their attention on the study of the French-Canadian national question of the period from Quiet Revolution in Quebec in 1960s and the 1990s. Attention also is drawn that this lack of coverage in the domestic historiography of the French-Canadian question of the period before the «Quiet Revolution» in Quebec needs further research to better understand the specifics of the problem. It is emphasized that due to the problem of access to Canadian archival sources when researching the issue in Ukraine, it is extremely important the recent publication of documents on the Internet, which can significantly affect the future prospects of domestic historiography of the French-Canadian problem.\n\nMullaly, Edward. \"The Saint John Theatre Riot of 1845.\" Theatre Research in Canada 6, no. 1 (January 1985): 44–55. http://dx.doi.org/10.3138/tric.6.1.44.\n\nFull text\n\nAbstract:\n\nThe Saint John theatre riot of 2 April 1845 was caused by Henry W Preston's production of a lost political satire entitled The Provincial Association, written by a Fredericton author and newspaper editor, Thomas Hill. While newspaper descriptions of the riot reflect largely on the personal animosities of the writers involved, the event itself provides an early Canadian illustration of theatre's power to move its audience to emotional extremes.\n\nBélanger, Damien-Claude. \"Loyalty and Lobbying: French-Canadian Delegates in London, 1763–1840.\" London Journal of Canadian Studies 35, no. 1 (November 30, 2020): 29–66. http://dx.doi.org/10.14324/111.444.ljcs.2020v35.003.\n\nFull text\n\nAbstract:\n\nThis article examines the individuals who came to London in order to lobby the imperial authorities in favour of the expansion of French-Canadian rights from the 1763 Treaty of Paris to the 1840 Act of Union and who were delegated by a significant body or institution within French Canada. Early efforts were centred on the expansion of religious rights and the perpetuation of Quebec’s legal and social institutions, including French civil law and the seigneurial system. Religious affairs remained an important facet of French-Canadian lobbying throughout the British regime, though the issue of political reform, which came to the fore in the 1780s, soon came to dominate lobbying efforts. These efforts were predicated on ideas of loyalty, as delegates sought to negotiate a place within the British Empire for French Canada. They lobbied London to allow French Canadians to fully participate in civic life within the framework of British political institutions while also allowing Quebec to retain its particular religious and social institutions. Delegates experienced some success, especially when they enjoyed the support of the colonial authorities at Quebec, but often failed to achieve their goals because they ran counter to British policy or because their English-speaking opponents had greater access to Whitehall.\n\nBeard, Morgan. \"La Satire Politique et la Liberte de la Presse au 19e Siecle (Political Satire and Freedom of the Press in 19th Century France).\" Ohio University Honors Tutorial College / OhioLINK, 2019. http://rave.ohiolink.edu/etdc/view?acc_num=ouhonors1556290778710013.\n\nFull text\n\nAttalla, Jessica. \"Examining the Impact of Canadian Political Satire Shows on Generation Y: A Qualitative Investigation of This Hour Has 22 Minutes.\" Thesis, Université d'Ottawa / University of Ottawa, 2015. http://hdl.handle.net/10393/33185.\n\nFull text\n\nAbstract:\n\nIn contemporary society, political satire shows are prominent programs that seem to resonate with the viewing public. This thesis seeks to observe the meanings that generation Y attach to the Canadian political satire show, This Hour Has 22 Minutes. Focusing on the Canadian context, this research examines how members of generation Y view political satire shows, specifically This Hour Has 22 Minutes and if this show caters to their attitudes, concerns and interests more so than traditional news media. The theoretical framework guiding this study is the uses and gratifications theory. This research implements a qualitative phenomenological research approach in the form of focus groups. This study concludes that this generation still maintains, however, that when looking to be informed, they connect more with traditional news media given that these programs provide them with all the facts and stories in a more reliable manner. This study contributes to the field of communication because it demonstrates the rationale and experiences of generation Y in relation to political news.\n\nDirnfeld, Rebecca B. \"Controlling the \"Chinese\" of the eastern states? Maine's constitutional amendment of 1893, electoral reform, and anti-French-Canadian bias.\" Thesis, University of Ottawa (Canada), 2009. http://hdl.handle.net/10393/28124.\n\nFull text\n\nAbstract:\n\nThis thesis examines a constitutional amendment adopted by the State of Maine in 1893 as part of an electoral reform package. It stated that any man who could not read the State Constitution in English or write his name on or after January 3, 1893 was not qualified to vote. Although some of the amendment's supporters claimed the measure would raise the quality of the state electorate, most supported it because it targeted immigrants, more particularly, French Canadian immigrants. Anglo-Republicans who supported the amendment discriminated against French-Canadians, who were Catholic, spoke French, and chose acculturation rather than assimilation. The amendment was meant to disenfranchise a large proportion of these voters, as many of them were illiterate, French speaking migrants. However, the impact of the amendment proved to be limited. It did not affect Franco-American allegiances to politicians or political parties they thought best supported their wants and needs. This may be why the amendment was quickly forgotten and is not mentioned in any published history of Maine. Statistics collected from the 1910 census, English and French language newspapers of Lewiston, and an out of state newspaper provide much of the primary sources for this work.\n\nCollette, Benôit, and François Pétry. \"Comparing the Position of Canadian Political Parties using French and English Manifestos as Textual Data.\" In From Text to Political Positions, 27–46.

This discussion examines satirical strategies employed by printmakers working at four key historical moments—the Reformation in Germany, the Dutch revolt from Spain, the French wars of religion, and the Commonwealth in England—in order to provide a larger context for the assessment of Romeyn de Hooghe’s innovation of the genre. Two strategies dominate the political prints considered in this chapter: (i) those that employ animal imagery, such as the animal fable and the animal hybrid; and (ii) those that feature individual human protagonists. This chapter introduces three themes that feature prominently throughout the book: (i) the elision of boundaries between man and animal; (ii) the treatment of the satirized body; and (iii) the inter-relationship between text and image. It is shown that the finished, closed, and choreographed body of formal portraiture that dominates earlier political prints gives way in De Hooghe’s satires to the expansive, gaping, and uncontrollable body that has been associated with the genre ever since.\n\nChristie, Nancy. \"The Making of Britannicus Canadensis.\" In The Formal and Informal Politics of British Rule In Post-Conquest Quebec, 1760-1837, 88–154. Oxford University Press, 2020. http://dx.doi.org/10.1093/oso/9780198851813.003.0003.\n\nFull text\n\nAbstract:\n\nThis chapter examines the growing political opposition among English-speaking political commentators against the Quebec Act of 1774 which protected French Canadian interests by preserving their right to practice their Catholic religion and use French civil law. It shows the way in which classical republican discourse diverged from that in the Thirteen Colonies and Britain: it absorbed Wilkite and radical Whig tenets into Country Whig principles, and these became increasingly inflected by a rabidly anti-Catholic and anti-French Canadian perspective as opposition writers sought to repeal and replace the Quebec Act. This chapter also traces the development of voluntary associations and clubs which functioned as an out-of-doors political opposition prior to the establishment of an assembly under the Canada Act of 1791, thereby elucidating the emergence of a public sphere which fostered a variety of local projects aimed at subverting French Canadian political rights, French law, and the seigneurial system.\n\nChristie, Nancy. \"“Thy Mangl’d Empire”.\" In The Formal and Informal Politics of British Rule In Post-Conquest Quebec, 1760-1837, 29–87. Oxford University Press, 2020. http://dx.doi.org/10.1093/oso/9780198851813.003.0002.\n\nFull text\n\nAbstract:\n\nBy analyzing the protests of merchants against the Stamp Act and other taxes, this chapter revises previous interpretations which have argued that there was no political agitation in Quebec similar to the Patriot opposition in the Thirteen Colonies. It also explores the emergence of classical republican modes of political discourse within the weekly newspapers and the censorship of radical Whig discourse throughout the American Revolution, demonstrating how political commentary thus became increasingly anti-American and more loyalist in tenor. It also compares the divergent strategies to maintain the allegiance of the French Canadian majority and the indigenous allies by the British government and Governors Carleton and Haldimand during the American Revolution, to show the emergence within official governmental circles of greater condemnation of the French Canadian majority who were represented as proto-rebels."
