        "text": "This magnificent pastel painting depicts Madame de Bled sitting in a armchair. She is adorned in a beautiful silk dress with a plethora of blue ribbons, as well as a delicate lace headdress, representing the fashion of the late Louis XV and early Louis XVI eras. Crafted by an unidentified but skilled artist, this portrait from approximately 1770 includes a gilded wooden frame and has been meticulously restored. The pastel on paper is mounted on acid-free cardboard and is accompanied by an original handwritten biography of the subject.\n\nMarie Elisabeth Anne de Bled was born in Quebec, Canada, on 13 February 1720. She was daughter of Charles de Bled, a royal surveyor from Normandy, France. Orphaned of father at the age of 5 and of mother at 14, she married before her 15th birthday to the merchant Jean Baptiste de Lagroix, 13 years her senior, with whom she had three children. Widowed in 1747, she remarried on 23 October 1753 (and not in 1750 as the label indicates) to Jean François Jacquelin, merchant and shipowner, with whom she had a son. The family relocated to France in 1766, after the cession of Quebec to Great Britain, and settled in La Rochelle, where Elisabeth de Bled died on 29 April 1798, aged 78.\n\nSource: Archives de France.\n\nArtist: Unknown (unsigned).\n\nMedium: Pastel on paper.\n\nCondition Excellent condition.\n\nDimensions : 58 x 48 cm. / 22 3/4 x19 in.\n\nFrame: 72 x 62 cm. / 28 1/4 x 24 1/2 in. Gilt wood, very good condition.\n\nOrigin: France.\n\nBeautiful original black and white lithograph by Achille Devéria (Paris, 1800-1857) printed by Lemercier Benard et Cie in 1838 in Paris. It represents a real scene from the life of the Italian painter Salvator Rosa (1615-1673), where he is captured by a band of Neapolitan bandits and paints the portrait of the chief's wife. French text: \" ROSA (Salvator) Le peintre tombe au pouvoir d'une troupe de Brigands Napolitains, fait le portrait de la maîtresse de leur chef \". This lithograph is stamped with the dry-stamp technique with initials FB, corresponding to François Bulla (1794-1853), one of the most important publishers of engravings in Paris, specializing in popular lithographs. Very good condition, with minor rubbing on the right and lower margins.\n\nAchille Devéria was an illustrator, painter, watercolourist, engraver, draughtsman, lithographer and curator in the print department of the Bibliothèque nationale, Paris. The son of a French naval officer, he began his artistic studies at an early age as a pupil of the painter Anne-Louis Girodet-Trioson, and then of Louis Lafitte. At the age of 22, Devéria was already invited to participate in the great Paris Salon exhibition of 1822, where he was very successful.\n\nFrom 1830 onwards, Devéria devoted himself mainly to lithography, depicting a whole series of characters, especially women, immortalised in the typical costumes of the time, as well as events of his time, which constitute a kind of historical album of the Romantic movement and era. He was one of the most famous portraitists of his time. Many personalities of the time posed for him in his Paris studio on Rue de l'Ouest, including Honoré de Balzac, Charles Baudelaire, Jacques Louis David, Marie Dorval, Alexandre Dumas, Théodore Géricault, Victor Hugo, Alphonse de Lamartine, Franz Liszt, Prosper Mérimée, Alfred de Musset, Charles-Augustin Sainte-Beuve, Sir Walter Scott, Alfred de Vigny and many others.\n\nIn 1849, Devéria was appointed director of the print department of the Bibliothèque nationale and assistant curator of the Egyptology department of the Louvre. Devéria spent his last years travelling in Egypt, where he drew and transcribed inscriptions. In the autumn of 1857, he returned from his travels ill and died in Paris a few weeks later.\n\nHis works are exhibited in the Louvre, the San Francisco Museum of Fine Arts, the J. Paul Getty Museum, the Norton Simon Museum and the University of Liege.\n\nThe company Lemercier, Bénard et cie was founded in 1837 by the printer Joseph Lemercier (1803-1887) and the engraver Jean François Bénard (1796-1859). It was active until 1843.\n\nSources: Laure Beaumont-Maillet (1985). \"Achille Devéria. Achille Devéria, witness of Parisian romanticism; Maximilien Gauthier (1925). H.

Created in 1776 by expert Antoine Louis Romanet, after collaborating with Mlle. Linot. The bottom is inscribed with: \"A Paris chez Romanet rue de la Harpe vis a vis les Jacobins\".\n\nAntoine Court de Gibelin was born near Nîmes on 5 September 1728 and died in Paris on 12 May 1784 at the age of 59. He was the son of pastor and theology professor Antoine Court, founder of the Séminaire de Lausanne, a clandestine establishment where future French pastors were trained (Protestantism had been banned there since the revocation of the Edict of Nantes). A physiocrat thinker and freemason, he was a member of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences, the Académie des belles-lettres, sciences et arts de La Rochelle and the Académie des sciences, belles-lettres et arts de Rouen.\n\nAntoine-Louis Romanet (Paris, 7 January 1742 - Saint-Maurice, 1 April 1807) was a French draughtsman, engraver and miniature painter. He was the cousin of the wife of the engraver Jean-Georges Wille (1715-1808), who trained him in the art of engraving. He exhibited at the Salon de la Correspondance from 1779 to 1787.\n\nSources: Wikipedia; Archives de France.\n\nArtist: Antoine-Louis Romanet (1742-1807)\n\nMedium: Etching on laid paper.\n\nCondition: Very good condition.\n\nDimensions: 35 x 26 cm. / 13 ¾ x 10 ¼ in.

Etching after Joseph Vivien, by St. Aubin.\n\nFrançois de Salignac de la Mothe Fénelon was born at Fénelon castle, in Périgord, on August 6, 1651. In 1689 he became Tutor to the Dauphin, the duke of Burgundy, grandson of Louis XIV. He was appointed archbishop of Cambrai in 1695.\n\nFénelon preached at the age of fifteen, was a religious writer and a mystical Christian philosopher. He left fifty-five works, of which at least two place him at the forefront of French literature: The Treatise on the Existence of God and Telemachus. Friend of Bossuet, he was later embroiled in a controversy with him which lasted three years and at the end of which he succumbed to the accusation of quietism brought against him by his terrible adversary; condemned by the court of Rome, Fénelon accepted this judgment with admirable humility (1699). He was exiled from the court and retired to his archbishopric; sick from the concussion felt in a car accident, he died six days later, on January 8, 1715. His eulogy was written by La Harpe and Alembert. The Scotsman Ramsay, Cardinal de Bausset and Abbé Gosselin each wrote a History of Fénelon.\n\nAugustin de Saint-Aubin (Paris, January 3, 1736 - Paris, November 9, 1808) was a French painter and printmaker. Member of a family of artists, he was the son of Gabriel-Germain de Saint-Aubin, embroiderer, and brother of Gabriel-Jacques de Saint-Aubin, Charles-Germain de Saint-Aubin and Louis-Michel de Saint-Aubin, all artists. He was first trained with his older brother Gabriel, then studied with Étienne Fessard (1755) and Laurent Cars (1764). He worked with Michelangelo Slodtz on \"The Little Pleasures of the King\". He devoted himself mainly to drawing and engraving, working as a chronicler of the society of his time: Concert, Bal de Gala (1773). He created a gallery of medallion portraits of famous people from Antiquity to his time. In 1777, he was appointed engraver of the Royal Library.\n\nSources: Académie française; Enciclopedia del Arte Garzanti, 1991.\n\nArtist: Augustin de Saint-Aubin (1736-1808).\n\nMedium: Copper etching.\n\nCondition: Very good condition.\n\nDimensions: 30 x 20 cm. / 12 x 8 in.

Engraved by Charles-Clément Bervic, engraver of the King and the Royal Academies of Paris and Rouen.\n\nRustic interior with young man sitting next to a woman and asking for her daughter's hand in marriage; the daughter stands next to her mother while the father and the other children are sitting on the right. – Beneath the image, on either side of a cartouche with coat of arms, a dedication (in French) reads:” Dedicated to His Serene Electoral Highness Monsignor Charles Théodore, // Count Palatine of the Rhine, Duke of Upper and Lower Bavaria Archidapifer and Elector of the Holy Empire, Duke of Juliers, Cleve and Berg ... By ... Ch. Cl. Bervic”.\n\nCharles Clément Balvay (23 May 1756, Paris – 23 March 1822, Paris), known as Bervic, was a French engraver mainly working in intaglio and exclusively in burin. He served his first apprenticeship under Jean-Baptiste Le Prince, then left aged 14 for the studio of the engraver Jean-Georges Wille. When he was 18, he won first prize for drawing at the Académie royale de peinture et de sculpture, of which he was elected a member in 1784. He became a member of the Académie des beaux-arts in 1803. He won many prizes and his drawing talents were particularly appreciated.\n\nJean-Charles Damour (1731-?) was an intaglio printer in Paris.\n\nSources: British Museum; BNF; Archives de France.\n\nArtist: Charles-Clément Balvay, dit Bervic (1756-1822).\n\nMedium: Engraving, mounted on cardboard\n\nCondition: Very good condition.\n\nDimensions: 63 x 73.5 cm. / 22 ¾ x 29 in.

Gilt wood, matting and glass.\n\nOrigin: France.\n\nFrontispiece of the first volume of The Law of War and Peace, Divided into Three Books by Hugo Grotius (1583-1645) and translated from Latin into French by Antoine de Courtin (1622-1685), with an allegorical representation with the bust of King Louis XIV, who is glorified there. Title, with vignette, and signed by P. Sevin and C. Vermeulen and dated 1687. Note that this frontispiece does not appear in the successive editions of 1688, 1703, 1746, 1759 and 1768.\n\nCornelis Vermeulen or Cornelis Martinus Vermeulen was a 17th century Flemish engraver, born around 1644 in Antwerp in the province of Flanders in Belgium. He trained in Peeter Clouwet's studio. He worked many times in Paris during short stays but without really settling in the French capital. His portrait engravings and book illustrations made him famous. He died around 1708 in Antwerp.\n\nPierre-Paul Sevin was born May 8, 1646 in Tournon-sur-Rhône (Ardèche) and died in the same city on February 2, 1710. He was a history painter and illustrator of allegorical compositions in the reign of Louis XIV. Born into a family of painters and first trained by his father, Pierre-Paul Sevin became a distinguished painter, decorator, illustrator and scenographer. On the death of his father, the young artist entered the Jesuit college in Lyon where he met Claude-François Ménestrier (1631-1705) and forged a long friendship with him. On the recommendation of Ménestrier, and with the help of the royal painter Charles Le Brun, Sevin was made a resident of the French Academy in Rome, recently created by King Louis XIV in 1666. While in Rome, Sevin documented into drawings many events that took place in the city, for which he also provided his own decorative motifs. In Venice, he recorded important processions and festivities that took place in the Lagoon during the first years of the 1670s. On his return to Paris, Sevin, in collaboration with Ménestrier, obtained numerous royal commissions, providing designs for ceremonial decorations for births, weddings, funerals and princely entrances.\n\nSources: Benezit Dictionary of Artists, 1999 Edition; Bibliotheca Visseriana, 1925; Archives de France.\n\nArtists: Cornelis Vermeulen (1644-1708) and Pierre-Paul Sevin (1646-1710).\n\nSigned and dated 1687.\n\nMedium: Etching on paper.\n\nCondition: Very good condition.\n\nDimensions: 25 x 18.7 cm. / 9 ¾ x 7 ½ in.

He began his artistic studies at the École des Beaux-Arts in his home town and later at the École des Arts Décoratifs in Paris. Trained as a drawing teacher, he worked for a few years in Algeria at the Lamoricière Lyceum in Oran between 1910 and 1920.

This portrait draws together all the characteristics of the portrait d’apparat, reserved for the monarchy, the nobility and the upper middle class: grandiose presentation with curtains, columns and classical dress, imposing posture of the character, who lays his right hand on what is probably his most important work.\n\nThe following text appears below the image: “Mre.

He was an apprentice of Gaspar Huberti (Huybrechts) and of Cornelius Galle the Younger, a renowned engraver from Antwerp. He moved to Paris where he studied and worked under the wing of well-known artists such as the painters Philippe de Champaigne and Charles Le Brun and the engraver Robert Nanteuil. Named by Louis XIV Knight of the Order of Saint Michel and Engraver of the King, he was already a professor at the small academy created at the Gobelins factory for the instruction of upholsterers. In 1672, he married Madeleine Reguesson, Nantreuil’s niece, with Charles le Brun and Philippe de Champaigne as witnesses. Gérard Edelinck was one of the most remarkable engravers of the 18th century and made a significant contribution to the art of engraving. It was he who first substituted diamond-shaped dimensions for square dimensions and who infused engravings with colour. He treated the works he reproduced with a little more realism, but preserved the softness of the art of Nanteuil. His output totals over 300 pieces.

He was the great-great-grandson of Philippe I, duc d'Orléans (1640-1701), younger brother of Louis XIV, and the great-grandson of Philippe II, duc d'Orléans (1674-1703), who as regent for Louis XV endeavored to secure his own secession over that of Philip V of Spain. Louis-Philippe-Joseph's own son Louis-Philippe reigned as King following the July Revolution of 1830. Louis-Philippe-Joseph was Louis XVI's cousin, but lived away from the royal court at Versailles due to his hostility toward the King's wife, Marie-Antoinette. Louis-Philippe-Joseph supported the underprivileged Third Estate and was considered a hero by the revolutionaries; after the fall of the monarchy in August 1792, he renounced his noble title and accepted the name Philippe Égalité. He was elected to the National Convention, and voted for the execution of Louis XVI. Nonetheless, Égalité himself was sent to the guillotine in 1793, accused of conspiring with his son, the future King, and Austrian accomplices.\n\nNicolas-François Le Vachez (1740-180.?), French engraver and intaglio printer.

It was created by Philippe Lefèvre and printed by the printer Robert Lefèvre after a painting by Hilaire Ledru. Lost caption below: \"Sold in Paris at Potrelle Md. D'estampes Rue Honoré N°54\".\n\nJean-Charles Pichegru, born in Planches-près-Arbois (Franche-Comté) on February 16, 1761, was a distinguished major-general during the French Revolutionary Wars. In 1789 he was a non-commissioned officer in an artillery regiment. He moved quickly up the ranks, from brigadier general to major-general. Under his command, French troops overran Belgium and the Netherlands before fighting on the Rhine front. He headed the Army of the Rhine and Moselle’s campaign to secure the French frontier at the Rhine and to penetrate the German states. The unsuccessful 1795 campaign led to his removal from command. His royalist positions led to his loss of power and imprisonment in Cayenne, French Guiana during the Coup of 18 Fructidor in 1797. After escaping into exile in London and joining the staff of Alexander Korsakov, he returned to France and planned the Pichegru Conspiracy to remove Napoleon from power, which led to his arrest. He was found strangled in prison on April 6, 1804. Despite his defection, his surname is one of the names inscribed under the Arc de Triomphe, on Column 3.\n\nPhilippe Lefèvre, painter and engraver, was born in Abbeville and worked in Paris between the years 1770-1810.

He was born into a family with an artistic bent and received his first training from his father, a surgeon and talented amateur. He subsequently studied with Joseph Gabriel Imbert (1666–1749), who had been a pupil of Charles Le Brun. Installed in 1752 in Paris, where he was accepted into the Académie de Saint-Luc. His portrait of the Dauphine in 1771 and his appointment as a peintre du Roi assured his success: most of his surviving portraits date from the 1770s and 1780s. Many of his portraits received a wider circulation as engravings.\n\nPierre-Charles Levesque (or Lévêque), born March 28, 1736 in Paris, where he died March 12, 1812, was a French engraver, teacher, translator and historian. Raised to be an engraver like his father, Levesque managed to acquire a surprisingly remarkable education, despite the setbacks of his family's fortune. He then earned a living for some time as an engraver, before being appointed, at the recommendation of Diderot, professor in St. Petersburg. Leaving in 1773, he became a professor at the Saint Petersburg Cadet School from 1778 to 1780.\n\nHe used his next seven years in Russia to collect material for a comprehensive history of this country, which he published on his return to France. This work was extremely successful: even in Russia, his “Histoire de Russie” became a classic, while in France, it opened the doors of the Académie des inscriptions for him (a French Humanities society), and later of the College de France. He translated Xenophon and Plutarch for the collection of ancient moralists, and his main literary title was a proper translation of Thucydides.\n\nSources: Archives BNF, Paris; Jean-Paul Chabaud, Joseph-Siffred Duplessis : Un provençal, Peintre du Roi, 2004; Mémoires de l'Institut de France, 1821; Racines Histoires: Famille Gilbert de Voisins.\n\nArtist: Pierre Charles Lévêque (1736-1812).\n\nMedium: Etching on laid paper.\n\nCondition: Very good condition.\n\nDimensions: 37 x 25.5 cm. / 14 ½ x 10 in.
