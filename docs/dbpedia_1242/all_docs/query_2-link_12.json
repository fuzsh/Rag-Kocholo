WASHINGTON, D .Cf\n\nNiTnD STATES PATENT @Finca NAPOLEON AUBIN, OF CANADA.\n\nIMPROVEMENT lN WATER-METERS.\n\nSpecification forming part of Letters Patent No. 36,201, dated August 19, i862.\n\nthe same. Fig. 3 is a plan of the valve-seat seen from the lower side; and Fig. 4 is a vertical section through the lost-motion contrivance in a plane perpendicular to the section, Fig. 2.\n\nThis meter has been devised with regard to cheapness of construction aud eftlciency and accuracy in operation. It contains some features identical withthose described infan application made by me for a patent now pending, and it is intended more especially for a house-meter, or a meter through which com-` paratively small quantities of Water are delivered. Its main features area diaphragm, a short slide-valve, and a reversing apparatus, and there are to be found in it certain novelties in construction, and also a novel combination of mechanism.\n\nThe whole meter is inclosed in a case or receptacle made in four pieces, a a b b c c d d. The two former constitute the measuring-chamber ofthe meter, and also contain the tumblingbob or reversing apparatus, and likewise constitute a side pipe. The piece cc contains the passages leading from the ports, and the piece d d forms the valve-chest. The valve-seat e e is a separate piece, merely dropped into place and formed separate so that it may be readily planed and ground or otherwise fitted for use,\n\nand also so that the valveseat may be of avr metal superior in durability and less liable to rust than other 'parts of the meter. I intend to make the valve-seat of brass and the case of iron or some soft alloy.\n\nThe parts a t and b b are joined to each other at the place of connement of the diaphragm, and the diaphragm packs the joint between them. This diaphragm e e may be of indiarubber, leather,or other suitable material, and has bolted to it two plates, f f, and also a standard, g g, which may be either two staples, such as shown in the drawings, secured side by side with an interval between them,\n\nor a hollow frustum of a cone, or a cylinder or box with a hole in the top.\n\nJust above the utmost range of the diaphragm is secured a rock-shaft, h. It has two arms, ij. To the former is .pivoted a rod, 7c, with a T-head, which lies in the conical frustum or between the staples. The latter, j, enters a fork on the lower end of a lever, l.\n\nThis lever is pivoted near its center, and its upper end passes through one of the ports in the valve-seat and enters into a hole in' the valve. A spring, m, bears upon a pin proj ecting from the arm j. This spring is secured at its upper end, and is so constructed-something like a sash-lock spring-that it tends to vibrate the lever whenever the arm j has passed the vertical in either direction. The spring is compressed by the rock-shaft when the arm j is forced to rise from either side toward the vertical, and when j has passed the vertical in either direction the spring expands and throws the rock-shaft over. The rock-shaft, arms, rod, spring, and lever I term the reversing apparatus,77 and a weight may be used in place of the spring, and the apparatus may be variously modilied, so long as a weight is raised or a spring compressed by the motions of the diaphragm, either up or down, and then by the falling of the weight or the expansion of the spring a valve is moved.\n\nUpon the valve-seat `slides a short slide valve, a. This seatk has in it, as usual, three ports, the center one leading to the exhaustpassage o and the other two one to each side of the diaphragm.\n\nWater is to pass through the induction-pipe p, and will thence iiow through the passage q and depress the diaphragm. Water beneath the diaphragm will tlow'out through s through one of the ports, through the valve-cup, and out through the exhaustport o. Vhen the diaphragm descends solow that the topofL q strikes the T-head on 7c, the rock-shaft willy commence to oscillate, compressing the spring. When its arm reaches the vertical, the sp1-ing will throw the rock-shaft over, and the lever will reverse the valve a, so that water will now enter through s and iow out through g, and the diaphragm will commence to riseand will keep rising. While so doing the upper plate on the diaphragm will strike the T-head,which will move the rock-shaft, and it will compress the spring until the latter throws the valve over again into the position shown `in lthe drawlngs. A rod and lever-such as4 m ly-are to be attached to some moving part of the apparatus, and they are to give motions to some appropriate counter or register of strokes of the diaphragm.\n\nIn this meter the diaphragm that is moved Aby and regulates the influx of water is connected directly to the reversing apparatus without the interposition of a pressure-plate, as desorlbed fin `my other application for a patent now pending, and it will be observed thatno Starling-boxes are here employed in order' to -make connections between the diaphragm and the valve; also, that the valve-seat is a separate piece dropped into place, and that the side pipeis cast or formed in both ports of thecase, the Joint in it being packed by a part of the diaphragm, which has a hole cut through it. I intend to pivot the lever and rock-shaft in a frame, which also supports the upper end of the spring, and slip this frame into place, holdlng it by screws, solder, pins, or otherwise, and also at times to cast the piece ein one with the piece b.\n\nIn this meter, also, the \"alve is. of such length that it will not cover both ports at the same time, and this peculiarity I ud to be advantageous in practice, as the valveis more easily moved from one side to the other when the meter is used under a considerable head of water. This construction, of course, involves some leakage which is not measured; but that leakage is nearly the same at`each stroke, and can be allowed for and added to the quantity of Water'indieated by the register as having passed through the meter.\n\nI sometimes intend to use a valve with lap,\n\nas in ordinary short slide steam-valves.\n\n,i I claim as of,my own invention-- i y l. The combination of a diaphragm With a reversing apparatus and a short slide-valve connected each with the other without the use ofstuffing-boxes,and the whole inclosed within a proper receptacle containing a valve-seat and constituting a fluid-meter, substantially such as is described, and acting substantially specified.\n\n2. A receptacleconstructed in two pieces,\n\none halfof which contains part of the side pipe and the other half the otherpart thereof, when the joint between the two is made by a dia phragrn, and the latter acts on a reversing apparatus contained in one half of the said receptacle, thel construction being substantially such as described.\n\n3. In combination with a diaphragm of a water-meter, a short slidevalve of less length than the distance from the outside of one port to the inside of the other port, the combination being substantially such as described.\n\nIn testimony whereof I have hereunto subscribed my name.\n\nN. AUBiN.\n\nVitnesses: I\n\nJOSEPH J. NIoHoLsoN,\n\nEUo. DE Rom"
