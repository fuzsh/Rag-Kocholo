        "text": "The history of French Sinology—that is, of scholarly research on things Chinese by French-speaking authors working from Chinese sources—goes back to the seventeenth century and can be divided into several periods determined in large part by sociopolitical factors, and marked by different approaches and emphases: I propose to describe them as the missionary age (seventeenth–eighteenth centuries); the first academic efflorescence (nineteenth century); the advent of field research and the impact of colonialism and the social sciences (first half of twentieth century); and the postwar era of specialization and internationalization (second half of twentieth century), which marked the end of a certain French domination of Chinese studies in the West.1\n\n1 A variety of studies have been devoted to French Sinology. The one essay that dominates the rest by its comprehensiveness and erudition is Demiéville, Paul, “Aperçu historique des études sinologiques en France,” Acta Asiatica 11 (1966), 56–110Google Scholar; rpt. in Demiéville, Choix d’études sinologiques (Leiden: Brill, 1977), 433–87. Out of modesty, presumably, Demiéville does not say a word of his own, considerable, contribution. (The same is true of his essay on teaching Chinese at the École des Langues Orientales, cited in n. 36.) One should also cite Henri Cordier (1849–1925), an ardent bibliographer and exacting historian of Sino-European relations, who published (in T'oung Pao and elsewhere) a series of essays on French Sinology in the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries featuring abundant quotes from archival materials.\n\n3 Voltaire's use of Jesuit writings in his critique of European absolutism and of Catholicism is the best known example of such misappropriation. The Beijing Jesuit Amiot, a particularly prolific author in the second half of the eighteenth century, told at one point of the missionaries’ being disgusted with working for Europe and seeing their writings quoted in “works of darkness aimed at combatting the very religion we are preaching at the risk of our lives”; see Louis Pfister, Notices biographiques et bibliographiques sur les jésuites de l'ancienne mission de Chine, 1552–1773, vol. 2 (Shanghai: Imprimerie de la Mission catholique, 1934), 839.\n\n5 Demiéville, “Aperçu historique,” 72, describes Fourmont as “un pédant médiocre et brouillon.” Nicolas Fréret, on the other hand, was a serious scholar with wide interests (and a resolute opponent of figurist theories); however, he does not seem to have actively pursued his Chinese interests beyond a 1718 memoir on Chinese writing in which he explained what he had been able to study with Arcade Hoange.\n\n9 Another questionnaire in fifty-two items, with elaboration and comments, was sent by Turgot sometime after Ko and Yang's return to China: see “Questions sur la Chine adressées à MM. Ko et Yang,” in Œuvres de Turgot, new ed. with various supplements (Paris: Guillaumin, 1844), vol. 1, 310–21. These are first of all an économiste's questions, with a clear physiocratic slant, rather than a Sinologist's, and the comments reveal quite a good command of the topics on the part of Turgot. There are also demands for sending seeds, samples, etc. Only the last three questions deal with Chinese history (to wit, the Kaifeng Jews, the Miao aborigines, and the Manchus’ degree of acculturation to Chinese ways).\n\n16 “Jean-Pierre Abel-Rémusat” is how he signed his own works; but in much of the literature, even during his own times, Abel and Rémusat are used as his first and last names. On various aspects of his personality and career, see most recently the essays by Pierre-Étienne Will, Isabelle Landry-Deron, Mark Elliott, Nathalie Monnet, Georges Métailié, Frédéric Obringer, and Anne Cheng in Jean-Pierre Abel-Rémusat et ses successeurs: Deux cents ans de sinologie française en France et en Chine, edited by Pierre-Étienne Will and Michel Zink (Paris: Académie des Inscriptions et Belles-Lettres, 2020).\n\n17 Manchu, let us recall, was one of the official languages of the Qing state, and would remain so through the fall of the empire. Abel-Rémusat's chair at the Collège de France was called “Langues et littératures chinoises et tartares-mandchoues,” and the same intitulé was maintained through 1918 (when Henri Maspero took over the chair), though in effect using Manchu as an aid for Chinese studies fell into abeyance after Stanislas Julien. A number of seventeenth- and eighteenth-century Jesuits were proficient in Manchu, and they used translations of Chinese text into Manchu, supposedly easier to understand, for their own translations into Latin and French; a manual on the language, the Elementa linguae Tartaricae (anon., attributed to Ferdinand Verbiest), appeared in Paris in 1696, and was used as a blueprint for Amiot's Grammaire tartare-mantchou (first published in the Mémoires concernant les Chinois in 1788). For all of this, see Mark Elliott, “Abel-Rémusat, la langue mandchoue et la sinologie,” in Will and Zink, Jean-Pierre Abel-Rémusat et ses successeurs, 49–69.\n\n19 The role of the Cabinet des manuscrits orientaux (which in fact holds a large quantity of printed books as well) has been central to the history of French Sinology, and Orientalism in general. To give but one example, it took care of the Dunhuang manuscripts brought back by Pelliot in 1909. It has regrettably been dismantled during the 2000s and integrated into the BnF Department of Manuscripts.\n\n22 Though he had been appointed to a chair in Bonn, he had convinced the authorities to allow him to stay in Paris, the only place with enough resources to do his work. He lived there for the rest of his life, and much of his published output is in French. Not everybody liked him in Paris, some even suspecting him of spying for the king of Prussia (who was funding his chair in Bonn).\n\n25 Nowhere has the articulation between the pioneering work of the Jesuits and the academic Sinology inaugurated by Abel-Rémusat been better encapsulated than in the following assessment by Édouard Chavannes: “One keeps marveling at the enormous amount of work then accomplished by a few French men of religion; confronted with a civilization made intimidating by its antiquity, its variety, and its expanse, these pioneers were able to open up the thoroughfares which allowed their successors to cast a general look at this immense domain and direct their investigations.” See Chavannes, La sinologie (Paris: Larousse, 1915), 5.\n\n36 On all of this see Paul Demiéville, “Le chinois à l’École Nationale des Langues Orientales Vivantes,” in Cent-cinquantenaire de l’École des Langues Orientales (Paris: Imprimerie Nationale, 1948), 129–61. (The first part of this essay offers the best description of the Chinese language I have ever seen.) Also see the contributions to Un siècle d'enseignement du chinois à l’École des Langues Orientales 1840–1945, edited by Marie-Claire Bergère and Angel Pino (Paris: L'Asiathèque, 1995). The École was profoundly reformed in 1869 with a view to restoring its original vocation as an institution teaching practical languages, whenever possible with the help of native coaches (“répétiteurs indigènes”). In 1874 it was allowed to move from its cramped quarters inside the Bibliothèque Nationale to a private mansion rue de Lille (still used for its research programs). The adjective “nationale” replaced “spéciale” and “vivantes” was added to “langues” in 1914, hence the acronym ENLOV, used until the École became INALCO in 1971.\n\n37 In his “Aperçu historique,” 81–82, Demiéville—himself a profound connoisseur of Chinese poetry—finds d'Hervey's translations of Tang poetry and of Qu Yuan's 屈原 Lisao 離騷 (published in 1870) not particularly elegant or philologically exacting, but remarks that he was the first to introduce the French public to this genre—and, it seems, with some success. On the life and career of d'Hervey de Saint-Denys, also see Angel Pino's detailed study in Bergère and Pino, Un siècle d'enseignement du chinois, 95–129, whose presence in that volume is justified by the fact that d'Hervey stood in for Julien at the École during the year 1869–1870. Pino devotes some space to the book for which d'Hervey's name is still renowned today, at least in some circles—a treatise on dreams published anonymously in 1867 and titled Les rêves et les moyens de les diriger, known to Freud and extolled by the Surrealists.\n\n39 See Leon d'Hervey de Saint-Denys, La Chine devant l'Europe (Paris: Amyot, 1859), a general description of China followed by an account of the Opium wars and of the most recent incidents, for which British aggressiveness and insensitivity are held essentially responsible; and Guillaume Pauthier, Histoire des relations politiques de la Chine avec les puissances occidentales depuis les temps les plus anciens jusqu'à nos jours, suivie du Cérémonial observé à la cour de Pé-king pour la réception des ambassadeurs, traduit pour la première fois dans une langue européenne (Paris: Firmin Didot, 1859), which is centered on the question of etiquette and rituals. Both books are verbose and somewhat rambling, and neither has much scholarly merit, but they display a sincere concern with defending China against prejudice and countering European propaganda.\n\n44 Chavannes made the 1907 five-month trip in North China in the company of his former student and ardent admirer Vassilii Alekseev (1880–1951), whose journal was published in Moscow in 1958; see Serge Elisseeff's (1889–1975) lively review in T'oung Pao 50.5 (1963), 575–92. Alekseev, who according to Elisseeff was regarded by his colleagues as “the brightest representative of the French Sinological school in Russia,” was interested above all in the productions of Chinese folk culture, whereas Chavannes would rather concentrate on the monuments of antiquity.\n\n45 Besides the traditional method of rubbing, Chavannes was among the first to use photography as a tool of archeological survey in China. When embarking on his famed mission to Central Asia in 1905, Pelliot had hired a professional photographer, Charles Nouette. (Chavannes's photographer was Chinese.) Chavannes's research on ancient sculpture was pursued by one of his students, the writer and navy doctor Victor Segalen (1878–1919), who in 1914 was commissioned to explore Shaanxi and Sichuan together with two colleagues, studying and photographing monuments of Han and Tang sculpture; several publications based on their investigations appeared in the 1920s and 1930s.\n\n47 See Édouard Chavannes, Les documents chinois découverts par Aurel Stein dans les sables du Turkestan oriental (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 1913). Aurel Stein had shipped all his materials in Chinese to Chavannes so that he could examine and catalog them. The same scenario was repeated after Stein's 1913–1915 expedition: this time Henri Maspero was the recipient (in 1920) of nearly a thousand documents on wood and paper. His manuscript was ready by 1936, but due to funding difficulties it was only published in 1953 by the British Museum as Les documents chinois de la troisième expédition de Sir Aurel Stein en Asie Centrale. For details see Michel Soymié, “Les documents d'Asie centrale dans l’œuvre de Maspero,” in Hommage à Henri Maspero 1883–1945 (Paris: Fondation Singer-Polignac, 1984), 61–67.\n\n50 See, among many others, the essays in Paul Pelliot: de l'histoire à la légende, edited by Jean-Pierre Drège and Michel Zink (Paris: Académie des Inscriptions et Belle-Lettres, 2013). The best, and at the same time quite entertaining, testimony on Pelliot the man, with his imposing personality and little foibles, is due to Denis Sinor (1916–2011), who was a favorite student between 1939 and 1945 and seems to have enjoyed the confidence of this standoffish and rather overbearing “maître.” See “Remembering Paul Pelliot, 1878–1945,” Journal of the American Oriental Society 119.3 (1999), 467–72.\n\n51 One important aspect of the training that most EFEO “pensionnaires” greatly benefited from was working with the Chinese and Vietnamese literati they were able to hire as assistants despite their rather low pay—a fruitful (even though criticized by some as typically “colonial”) method encountered in many other contexts as well. The BEFEO has appeared regularly from 1901 to the present, with an interruption during the Pacific and First Indochina Wars in the 1940s and early 1950s. For a review of Sinological work during the first twenty years of EFEO, including regular reports on the contemporary situation in China, see the (unsigned) contribution by Paul Demiéville in BEFEO 21 (1921), 366–87.\n\n54 From Beijing Pelliot went to Shanghai and Wuxi, then sailed to Hanoi, returning to Beijing in May 1909, and to Paris (where his sponsors were impatiently waiting for him to celebrate) via Russia in October of the same year. Much has been written on Pelliot's mission in Central Asia. For two recent and extremely detailed accounts, using Pelliot's diary (published in 2008 as Carnets de route 1906–1908) and his private papers held at Musée Guimet, see Éric Trombert, “La mission archéologique de Paul Pelliot en Asie Centrale (1906–1908),” in Drège and Zink, Paul Pelliot, 45–82 (including a day-by-day chronology of the expedition), and Jean-Pierre Drège, “La mission de Paul Pelliot au Turkestan chinois et en Chine (1906–1909): les clefs d'un succès,” in Will and Zink, Abel-Rémusat et ses successeurs, 263–331.\n\n56 For details on Pelliot's dealings with Chinese officials and scholars, who were generally captivated by his fluency in Chinese and vast erudition, see Rong Xinjiang and Wang Nan, “Paul Pelliot en Chine (1906–1909),” in Drège and Zink, Paul Pelliot, 83–119. After the expedition Pelliot continued to exchange with his Chinese colleagues and sent them a large number of photographs of the documents held in Paris, as he had promised to do, in several installments. Among the scholars of note with whom he exchanged correspondence for many years are Luo Zhenyu 羅振玉 (1866–1940), Wang Guowei 王國維 (1877–1927), and Dong Kang 董康 (1867–1947). He also had particular respect for Chen Yuan 陳垣 (1880–1971). In general, his familiarity with the research published in China was exceptional among Western Sinologists and much valued by his Chinese colleagues.\n\n58 There was some important prewar research, however. For example, many of the sources used in Demiéville's Concile de Lhasa (on which see below; though the book was published in 1952, the research dates from the 1930s) are Dunhuang documents. Demiéville was helped in his research by the librarian and scholar Wang Zhongmin 王重民 (1903–1975), who spent several years in Paris preparing a preliminary catalogue of the Pelliot collection at the Bibliothèque Nationale before moving to the Library of Congress and ultimately becoming head of the Library Science Department at Peking University.\n\n62 Pelliot was one of only three European Sinologists to be thus honored by IHP (there was also an honorarium), the other two being Bernhard Karlgren (1889–1978) and F.W.K. Müller (1863–1930). Pelliot had been a corresponding fellow of Peking University since 1923. When he received the invitation from Academia Sinica he was at Harvard, where he had been invited to help organize the newly established Harvard-Yenching Institute. (Some time later he was invited to become its director, but he declined and suggested Harvard hire Serge Elisseeff instead.)\n\n68 The EFEO library in Hanoi, which during the first half of the twentieth century developed into a world-class collection on the cultures of East Asia, including an outstanding collection of Chinese books, was transferred to the Vietnamese government in 1956. Before this took place, however, part of the collections could be moved to other centers in Southeast Asia and to the new EFEO library in Paris. The Vietnamese archive assembled and safeguarded thanks to the exertions of the “colonial” EFEO members remained in Hanoi and is now one of the treasures of the Vietnam National Museum of History (itself a continuation of the EFEO Louis Finot Museum).\n\n70 The English version includes a useful introduction by Denis Twitchett, discussing Maspero's accomplishments and summarizing the advances made in the field since the original publication of La Chine antique. Incidentally, in a tribute written a little later, Twitchett spoke of Maspero as “perhaps in our century the most illustrious name of Sinology”—a distinction generally reserved for Pelliot; see Hommage à Henri Maspero, 13. Edwin Pulleyblank comments in a review essay on why despite its obsolescence in several respects Maspero's synthesis remains a unique effort and still deserves to be read; see “La Chine Antique Revisited,” Pacific Affairs 53.1 (1980), 115–19.\n\n71 Maspero's writings on Daoist religion are found in vol. 2 of the three-volume Mélanges posthumes sur les religions et l'histoire de la Chine (Paris: Presses Universitaires de France, 1950). Also note an important text on “La religion chinoise dans son développement historique” in vol. 1. These and other essays on the subject have been collected in Henri Maspero, Le taoïsme et les religions chinoises (Paris: Gallimard, 1971). For a learned assessment of Maspero's Daoist studies by one of his most eminent successors, see Max Kaltenmark, “Henri Maspero et les études taoïstes,” in Hommage à Henri Maspero, 45–48, as well as his preface to Le taoïsme et les religions chinoises. Maspero's understanding of “la religion chinoise” as a non-contradictory blend of many beliefs and doctrines was novel at a time when scholars tended to see everything through the same Confucian lenses as their sources. His very last publication, a review of vol. 2 and 3 of Otto Franke's Geschichte des chinesischen Reiches (1936–37), contains a vivid passage on the “intensely religious” Three Kingdoms and Six Dynasties period, with all the popular fervor and agitation in Daoist and Buddhist festivals and “democratization” of purification and immortality practices—something, Maspero regrets, that Franke completely missed, ensconced as he was in a perspective heavily dependent on Zhu Xi's Tongjian gangmu. See Orientalistische Literaturzeitung 45 (1942), col. 260–66.\n\n72 According to later testimonies, Maspero had been in contact with the underground résistance, but he himself never said a word of it, not even to his wife, and in all probability the Germans were not aware of it. In 1943, Maspero, Pelliot and several colleagues were arrested by the Germans and spent about ten days in prison, nobody knowing exactly what was the cause, and why they were released. Though Pelliot does not seem to have belonged to a resistance network, he behaved openly as a “patriot” (he was a sort of patriotic conscience among his colleagues at the Collège de France and at the Société Asiatique, which he chaired at the time), encouraged his students to join the “maquis,” and did not conceal his hatred of the Vichy regime and, especially, of the invaders: to a German scholar who wished to visit him he responded: “When we have won the war.”\n\n74 This was to be his only stay in China, if one excepts a short visit to Beijing in 1919 after he had served—like Pelliot and several other Orientalists—on the French military mission of assistance to the anti-Bolshevik forces in Siberia. In his letter of support in 1911, Chavannes noted that Granet had followed his courses at the Collège de France and EPHE for two years (he must also have learned the basics of the language at the École des Langues Orientales), and asserted that, although his Chinese was still limited, a stay in China would allow him to make rapid progress—which it did, at least as far as reading texts is concerned: one is indeed stunned how fast he mastered the tools and sources of Sinology. See “Dossier de mission en Chine de Marcel Granet,” edited by Goudineau, Yves, Gradhiva: revue d'histoire et d'archives de l'anthropologie 14 (1993), 101–12CrossRefGoogle Scholar.\n\n75 See in particular his conclusion to La religion des Chinois (1922), on religious feeling in modern China, which he acknowledges is principally based on his own observations, therefore inevitably limited. Granet would also refer on occasion to customs or practices attested in non-Han groups from the Chinese frontiers in order to illustrate or confirm some of his points. This was from secondary sources, however, very far from Maspero's immersion in and personal contact with Vietnamese or Chinese populations to understand their beliefs and practices. Granet had been soundly trained in the analysis of ethnographic materials by Durkheim and Mauss and had extensive knowledge of the relevant sources.\n\n77 One of the most damning criticisms I know of is the review (or more appropriately, savaging) of Granet's La civilisation chinoise by the famous scholar and geologist V.K. Ting (Ding Wenjiang 丁文江, 1887–1936), who also takes Granet to task for his Shijing translations and the theories he derived from them in his first books. The text starts ominously: “A Chinese historian well-acquainted with European Sinological literature is never tired of saying that all Sinologists are incompetent pedants.” While Ting makes clear that this is unjust regarding the work of such scholars as Pelliot or Karlgren, he then adds: “But Prof. Granet's new book with its facile generalisations and erroneous reading of Chinese texts tends to prejudice the mind of Chinese scholars against European Sinology.” See Mitteilungen des Seminars für Orientalische Sprachen an der Friedrich-Wilhelms-Universität zu Berlin 34 (1931): 161–76 (the text is in English). For a more recent example, see Léon Vandermeersch, Wangdao ou la voie royale: Recherches sur les institutions de la Chine archaïque, vol. 1 (Paris: École française d'Extrême-Orient, 1977), 239–60, disproving most of the conclusions offered in Catégories matrimoniales et relations de proximité.\n\n81 The only activity associated with IHEC before 1926 seems to have been a course on Chinese civilization delivered at the Sorbonne by Granet (who had been recommended by Pelliot when the latter decided to remain aloof) and Louis Laloy (1874–1944), a former Chavannes student who among many activities (he was secretary general of the Paris Opera from 1913 to 1940) specialized in Chinese music and literature.\n\n83 For Louis Laloy, see n. 81, above. Arnold Vissière (1858–1930), who had a twenty-year experience with China as interpreter and diplomat, was an exacting professor of Chinese at the École des Langues Orientales from 1899 to 1930. Louis Finot (1864–1935), an Indianist and Southeast Asia archeologist, and for many years director of EFEO in Hanoi, was at the time professor at the Collège de France. Paul Boyer (1964–1949), a Russia specialist, was general administrator of the École des Langues Orientales.\n\n84 A further course on Chinese science, which was planned to be entrusted to invited Chinese scholars, could be set up only erratically due to the difficulty of finding adequate candidates. Starting in 1927–28, a course on Chinese law was taught every year by Jean Escarra (1885–1955), a professor of law who seriously studied Chinese and from 1921 spent long periods in China as an advisor to the Republican government.\n\n85 Having just been appointed head of EPHE in replacement of Marcel Mauss (dismissed as a Jew), Granet was called for an interview with the newly appointed Vichy Minister of Education. A patriot and a socialist, Granet could only detest the representatives of the newly installed Vichy government and their policies. The meeting is said to have been extremely tempestuous. Back at his home in the southern suburbs in the evening (which he had to reach on foot because the trains were not running), he died of a heart attack. His widow, Marie Granet (1892–1990), a high school teacher, a socialist militant, and a strong personality, participated actively in the Résistance, of which she later became an archivist and historian.\n\n86 On January 25, 1945—only months after the liberation of Paris and while the war was still going on—Pelliot gave a talk at the Chinese Art Society of America in New York City, on “Orientalists in France During the War.” Apart from listing those who had died or were missing (such as Maspero, of whom nothing had been heard since September of 1944), this intensely patriotic speech offered a general view of the dire straits in which French Oriental Studies had found themselves under German occupation, of the current general state of exhaustion, and of the difficulties ahead. The text is found in Archives of the Chinese Art Society of America 1 (1945/1946), 14–25, following Pelliot's obituary by Serge Elisseeff.\n\n89 I have not found mention of Japanese students. Chinese students are a particular case, if only by their numbers during the interwar period. Not a few Chinese studying in France were first trained at the Institut franco-chinois in Lyon, which functioned in tandem with the Université franco-chinoise in Beiping—both were operating largely with Boxer funds. Others had various backgrounds, in China, in France, or elsewhere. Among them, over forty students or former students of IHEC defended and often published French dissertations dealing with Chinese topics (only part of these qualifying as “Sinology,” however) between the 1930s and 1950s. A few former IHEC students did enter the French academic system after the war and made careers there. See Stéphanie Homola, “Le dialogue entre étudiants chinois et sinologues françois à l'Institut des Hautes Études Chinoises (1927–1968),” in Will and Zink, Abel-Rémusat et ses successeurs, 509–38.\n\n92 The entries are by alphabetical order of the Chinese terms (in Japanese pronunciation)—the first entry of fascicle 1 being “A” 阿. The Hōbōgirin had a checkered history. The project was stopped after the first three fascicles, plus a supplement, published between 1929 and 1937, due among others to the Pacific War. It was resurrected in the 1960s and housed in a detached temple of the Shōkokuji 相國寺 in Kyoto, becoming the Japan branch of EFEO. For over three decades the Hōbōgirin Institute was a center of East Asian religious studies visited by countless scholars from every country, who all retained (or still retain, like the present writer) fond memories of this magical place where scholarship and friendship flourished. Five new Hōbōgirin fascicles appeared between 1967 and 2003, with entries that increasingly took the form of substantial monographs. The editors were Jacques May (1927–2018), Anna Seidel (1938–1991), and Hubert Durt (1936–2018)—a Swiss, a German, and a Belgian, the first two having been trained in Paris and the third in Brussels under the famous Indianist and Buddhologist Étienne Lamotte (1903–1983). Subsequently it was decided to completely reshape the project, abandoning the alphabetical pattern (only the letter “D” had been reached) and preparing conference volumes concentrating on particular topics. For details, see Iyanaga, Nobumi, “A History of the Hōbōgirin: Dictionnaire envyclopédique du bouddhisme d'après les sources chinoises et japonaises,” The Eastern Buddhist 481 (2017), 7–22Google Scholar.\n\n98 A large selection of Demiéville's essays, reviews, and annual summaries of Collège de France lectures, has been published (in fac-simile form) in two thick volumes: Choix d’études sinologiques (1921–1970) and Choix d’études bouddhiques (1929–1970) (Leiden: Brill, 1973). Both volumes include a near-complete bibliography of his writings, including the many reviews and bibliographical notes he freely published in T'oung Pao, which he edited or co-edited from 1947 to 1975: this was “his” journal, as it had been Pelliot's before him. When Jacques Gernet and Erik Zürcher took over in 1975, T'oung Pao reverted to a more conventional pattern, and in time it has had to adapt to the present “peer review” epoch. Pelliot and Demiéville certainly did not need peer reviewing: they had no peers.\n\n100 On Balazs, see the essays in Actualité d’Étienne Balazs (1905–1963): témoignages et réflexions pour un centenaire, edited by Pierre-Étienne Will and Isabelle Ang (Paris: Collège de France, Institut des Hautes Études Chinoises, 2010), which also provides a comprehensive bibliography of Balazs's writings, including unpublished pieces and translations of his works. See also Zurndorfer, Harriet, “Not Bound to China: Étienne Balazs, Fernand Braudel and the Politics of the Study of Chinese History in Post-War France,” Past & Present 185 (2004), 189–221CrossRefGoogle Scholar. The obituary of Balazs by Demiéville in T'oung Pao 51.2–3 (1964), 247–61, is especially valuable because the two were close friends and Demiéville quotes from a number of Balazs's letters to him.\n\n102 Apart from his leftist inclinations and abhorrence of the Nazi regime, the exact reasons why Balazs left in 1935, and then went into hiding in 1940, are not known with precision. The political commitment of his German wife may have played a role. Balazs's former assistant Françoise Aubin's (1932–2017) interesting study on his politics, “Sinologie et politique. Autour d’Étienne Balazs (1905–1963),” Études chinoises 27 (2008), 147–61, shows that to the end of his life Balazs dabbled in critical Marxist politics, moving in Marxist oppositional circles and publishing texts under pseudonyms. His hatred of bureaucratic capitalism, in both Communist and capitalist countries, is reflected in his articles on the Chinese imperial polity.\n\n127 There was an exception, however: as early as 1900 courses on China and East Asia in general were offered at the University of Lyon, though on a very modest scale and with a strong commercial and colonial orientation—for centuries Lyon had been indirectly connected with the East through its silk industry, and more recently its Chamber of Commerce (which was funding the courses) had supported efforts to establish direct commercial relations with China. The first lecturer, made full professor in 1913, was Maurice Courant (1865–1935), who had been Chavannes's classmate at the École des Langues Orientales and started his career as an embassy interpreter in China, also becoming a specialist of Korea. Today Courant is mainly remembered by Sinologists for his catalog of Chinese books at the Bibliothèque Nationale (only recently made obsolete by the digitization of the BnF catalog). In Lyon he was instrumental in helping set up the Institut Franco-chinois (1921–1946), which prepared Chinese students to higher education in France. See the extended essay by Bouchez, Daniel, “Un défricheur méconnu des études extrême-orientales: Maurice Courant (1865–1935),” Journal Asiatique 271 (1983), 43–150Google Scholar.\n\n129 André Lévy is the only French Sinologist of note who was born and raised in China. His father, the owner of a jeweler's shop in Tianjin, took his family back to France when the Japanese invaded in 1937. During the war the young Lévy joined the “maquis” of the French Resistance in the Auvergne mountains. He started studying Chinese (as well as Japanese and Sanskrit) after the war.\n\n130 Of the five volumes of the final, descriptive catalog—as opposed to the preliminary lists drafted by Pelliot and Wang Zhongmin before the war—the first, which had been prepared by Jacques Gernet and Wu Chi-yu in the 1950s, appeared in 1970; the second, which was entrusted to Bibliothèque Nationale scholars, never materialized; the last three were published by Soymié's team between 1983 and 1995. For an account of Soymié's life and oeuvre and a detailed list of his publications (a not inconsiderable part of which appeared in Japanese), see Drège, Jean-Pierre, “Michel Soymié (1924–2002),” BEFEO 89 (2002), 6–14CrossRefGoogle Scholar.\n\n138 Guillermaz, who had been appointed French military attaché in China in 1937 and spent the years 1941–1943 in Chongqing, returned to Nanjing in the same capacity in 1946, remaining there until 1951. He also advised the French delegation at the Geneva conference on Vietnam in 1954. He retired from active duty in 1958, the year he agreed to set up a Chinese documentation center at EPHE, and in time became a “Directeur d’études” with his seminar and students. In 1964 General de Gaulle entrusted him with the uncomfortable task of visiting Chiang Kai-shek in Taiwan to inform him that France was about to establish diplomatic relations with mainland China. The same year he became the first military attaché to the new French embassy in Beijing (with the rank of general), and he stayed there through 1966. Though superseded by later research in some respects, his Histoire du Parti communiste chinois, 1921–1949 (Paris: Payot, 1968, English edition 1972, new edition 1975) and its sequel Le Parti communiste chinois au pouvoir, 1949–1972 (Paris: Payot, 1972) remain standard reference works."
