        "text": "Today we have the ultimate guest blog post. While Napoleon himself has long since passed on, he is ably represented in our time by Mark Schneider who has portrayed Napoleon at events around the world since 2005. As you can tell from the photos and the story below, Napoleon is fortunate to have Mark carry on his legacy.\n\nBecause this blog is about the experiences of the soldiers on the Russian campaign, I asked Mark if he would be willing to write about his thoughts and experiences during the re-enactment marking the 200th anniversary of the battle of Borodino (la Moskova). He readily agreed and here is the result.\n\n—\n\nWhen I look back at the great experiences that I have had portraying Napoleon since 2005, one of the great highlights will certainly have to be “La Bataille de la Moskova.” My name is Mark Schneider and I have had the great honor and pleasure to portray Emperor Napoleon Bonaparte in Europe since 2005. My first event was Waterloo and the experience has changed my life forever. Since that fateful afternoon in June, 2005, I have also had the honor to portray Napoleon at the 200th anniversary of Austerlitz (2005,), Jena (2006,) Berlin (2006,) Erfurt (2008,) and many other anniversary events such as Hollabrunn (2006-7,) Mormant (2007,) Borodino (2007,) Waterloo (2008,) Austerlitz (2007,8,11,) Sarzana (2011,) Jena (2011,) and now the 200th anniversary of the Battle of Borodino!\n\nAppearing as Napoleon at the 195th anniversary of Borodino gave me a taste of what it was going to be like in 2012. The battlefield was truly amazing to behold. The museum of Borodino was also quite magnificent with such items as Kutuzov’s carriage, uniforms and sadly even a French Eagle as well as many cannons. I was given a tour of many portions of the battlefield that I had read about since I was a child in David Chandler’s “Campaigns Of Napoleon” as well as de Ségur’s “Napoleon’s Russian Campaign, Paul Britten Austin’s “1812-Napoleon’s Invasion of Russia,” and Caulaincourt’s “With Napoleon in Russia.” It was one thing to read about this battlefield and quite another to walk or ride upon it! All of this was a great introduction to the huge anniversary event that would take place 5 years later.\n\nI was asked to attend the 200th anniversary event of Borodino over a year before it took place. My host was Alexander Valkovitch, a great historian and friend who has participated in many events with me to include Hollabrunn and Erfurt as Czar Alexander I. When all of the planning and organizing was complete, I received the official invitation. I was most excited to attend this great event that would commemorate the bloodiest single day in the Napoleonic Wars. Well, just as Napoleon had a long way to go in the campaign before Borodino was fought, so I too had a long way to go before I finally received my VISA! Once in my hand I was off to Moscow! It was a long journey, just as it was a long journey for the Grande Armee. Upon arrival, I then had to drive the 150KM south-west to the battlefield, and though I was not harassed by cossacks, there was a tremendous amount of Russian vehicle traffic on the highway. Upon arrival, I discovered that it was all worth it because I was about to participate in one of the most amazing events in re-enacting history.\n\nI arrived just as the sun was going down and our driver was kind enough to point out some of the monuments on the way. When we finally pulled into the camp site it was quite a sight to behold. The hundreds of tents and horses and cannons and soldiers walking about certainly made me feel as if I had returned back to September of 1812. I met my host Alexander Valkovitch and some other old friends from past events, and we enjoyed a late dinner and spoke of the battle and the days to come. I would turn in at a rather early hour of 11 pm and my accommodations would not be a tent but rather a former Soviet school! Just for one night though for the next night would be in the field.\n\nAfter a restful night’s sleep, I donned my Chasseur a Cheval de la Garde Imperiale habit, and began the event. A quick Russian breakfast, a few press interviews and I was off to the cavalry camp where I would find my horse and my escort of the Chasseurs a Cheval commanded by my friend Capitaine Jean-Francois Remy Neris. At the cavalry camp there were many of my old friends waiting and it was truly a delight to see them. The sun was shining and all was well. I mounted my gray horse “Tauris” and went to the battlefield to review the Army. It was truly amazing to see so many beautiful units in attendance! Infantry, artillery and so many cavalry! Cuirassiers, Carabiniers, hussars, lancers, Chasseurs, Grenadiers a cheval and more! Truly a sight to see.\n\nThe Saturday event was basically a rehearsal for the main event on Sunday. We spent many hours in the saddle upon the battlefield watching the two great armies maneuver, fire, charge, get used to their mounts and prepare for the big day. As the day began to end, we marched back to the cavalry camp where we would rest for the night.\n\nThe next morning found the weather cloudy, cool and rainy. The Grande Armee was to participate in a ceremony by the one monument on the Borodino battlefield that honored the Grande Armee. In attendance was former President of the French Republic, Valéry Giscard d’Estaing. He gave a very moving speech honoring all the soldiers that had died, and then I had the honor to meet with him and shake his hand.\n\nWhen the ceremony was over, the rain was falling, but the battle had to go on! 200,000 people were expected to attend, rain or shine. We had time for a quick lunch and then it was back in the saddle and on to the battlefield.\n\nTo say that it was amazing is an understatement! At the head of the Etat-Major and the cavalry we marched out of the woods on to the field. What a spectacle! Thousands of soldiers and 200,000 people! We took up our positions and the battle began. Though there was a drizzle, I think it added to the atmosphere. When the cannons and the muskets began firing it obscured portions of the battlefield so at certain moments you could not see the crowd\n\nand only the soldiers on the field. It was as if September 7th 1812 had returned! From my position on the hill I could observe the entire field. I rode past the army to give them some encouragement, and then the onslaught began. The Great Redoubt had to be taken! The cannons roared, the cavalry charged, occasionally with riders tumbling off their mounts! Fortunately there were no serious injuries. As all this was going on, a narrator was giving a play by play of what was happening. As the battle continued, I left the safety of my ridge, with the Imperial Guard close at\n\nhand and decided to take a closer look at the action. Marshal Ney rode up to me and said that the victory was ours if we would only commit the Guard, but I simply could not commit my last reserves so far from home. Victory would have to come with the men already engaged. I sent him back into the fray. The commander of my escort cautioned me that it was dangerous for the Emperor to be so close to the action, and he was right! Soon a Regiment of Cossacks was on us, galloping straight for me! My Chasseurs jumped into action and saved me, giving me time to place myself behind my beloved Guard. The battle began to come to an end. Just as the brave soldiers of the Grande Armée as well as the Russian Army fought to exhaustion that fateful day, so did the brave re-enactors. The time had come to end this great spectacle. The armies formed up in front of the thousands of spectators who had weathered the rain and cold . We galloped past them half a dozen times saluting them as well as the brave combatants. It was a moment I will never forget.\n\nThe armies then began to march off, and I, still escorted by my faithful Chasseurs a cheval, began my ride back to the cavalry camp. Upon arrival I thanked my horse for bringing me safely through this weekend spectacular. I had a brief rest with my comrades, but soon it was time for me to go. After one last goodbye and thank you to my host Alexander Valkovitch, I had to get back on the road to the airport in Moscow. 200,000 people would be joining me, so a trip that would normally take one and half hours, now took five! It was worth it!\n\nI will never forget this amazing event at Borodino. It was truly a dream come true for me. I have been interested in Napoleon and his times since I was a little boy and dreamed of fighting in his battles. Well now that dream has come true. More than all of that, it was an honor to take part in an event that honored all of the soldiers that fought and died that day. I hope that by remembering and reenacting such a great event in history and all the sacrifices that were made, no one will ever forget.\n\nMark Schneider\n\n“NAPOLEON”\n\n—\n\nBlogger’s Note: Thank you Mark for this terrific post! ~ Scott Armstrong\n\nAlexey Temnikov, a re-enactor with the French 5th Cuirassiers, recently participated in the 200th anniversary of the battle of Borodino. I met Alexey through Facebook and he has been extremely generous with his time and talents in translating Russian for me, sharing photos and images depicting the period as well as providing the information for this blog post about the re-enactment at Borodino.\n\n—\n\n2012 is the 200th anniversary of the Patriotic War of 1812 when the Russians defeated Napoleon. Many re-enactments of battles from that year have taken place (Smolensk, Pavlovsky Posad, Tarutino and Maloyaroslavets) and another yet to come (Berezina). In addition there have been exhibitions, festivals and concerts. New movies have been filmed and small battles have been staged even in places Napoleon did not go such as Krasnoyarsk. But the biggest event of all was the re-construction of the battle of Borodino held in early September.\n\nAlexey became interested in the Napoleonic period when his parents gave him a copy of In the Terrible Time by Mikhail Bragin as a birthday present. He sought out and watched the movies War and Peace and Waterloo and was hooked. An admirer of horses and a rider from a young age, only the hussars would do when Alexey decided to join a re-enactment regiment in 1992. He remembers calculating how old he would be at the 200th of Borodino. Originally, he joined the Russian cuirassiers wearing the uniforms of the Military Order of St. George. In 2002, however, his career called and he left re-enacting. After a visit to Borodino, Alexey returned to the hobby in 2010, this time as a member of the 5th Regiment of Cuirassiers of Napoleon’s army, a unit where he had many friends. As an added benefit, he was able to do some re-enactments with his son, Andrew.\n\nTo stage a re-enactment of Borodino required much planning. An event of this significance attracted thousands of re-enactors from around the world: The United States, Canada, Europe and all over Russia. There were problems with visas and permission to bring weapons into the country. Horses that used to rent for $100 per day now had a going rate of $170. Tents had to be found for the participants from abroad. Organizers bought firewood, straw and hay, and brought in toilets as well as bathing and drinking water. Fellow re-enactors stepped forward to help provide what the organizers could not, such as warm clothes, hot food and beverages to keep their guests warm. Some of these re-enactors arrived 10 – 15 days ahead of the anniversary. Regiments cooked their own food leading up to the event when organizers fed them for the last two days.\n\nOn the day of the event, September 2, there were ceremonies to honor the fallen of 200 years ago. The Russian ceremony was on the Rayevski battery at the Great Redoubt. The French ceremony was held at the monument for the Fallen of the Grande Armée. Russian President Vladimir Putin represented Russia while former French President Valéry Giscard d’Estaing represented France. In the soldiers’ camp, Alexey’s 5th Regiment of Cuirassiers held their own ceremony honoring members who had passed away. They made a display of photos of these fallen comrades who were unable to be there on that special day.\n\nThe logistics of accommodating the crowd and preparing for the visit of President Putin were enormous. Security forces examined the entire area of the re-enactment and uncovered 32 kilograms of explosives from WWII. Roads were blocked by the police and tourists had to walk as far as eight kilometers to the site.\n\nThe battle was re-enacted in three stages: the battle for the town of Borodino and the crossing of the Koloch river, the attack on the village of Semenovskaya, and the assault on the Great Redoubt. Rain began to fall as the two hour re-enactment came to an end with many horses falling on the wet grass.\n\nThe crowd was ecstatic with the appearance of Mark Schneider and Pavel Timofeev portraying Emperor Napoleon and General Mikhail Kutuzov, respectively. Alexey said having them there added beauty to the battle.\n\nAlexey summed his experience up as follows: “Borodino has an extraordinary aura, a kind of energy. It is hard to describe, but one can feel it. In the evening fog as if the shadows of the fallen, one cannot help thinking – I am not a coward, but how can I go into battle and kill people with my sword and trample them with my horse? I fall asleep to the sounds of the camp and the neighing of the horses. For all of us, all of Russia and all of the visitors – that day will be remembered forever.”\n\n—\n\nBlogger’s Note –\n\nI (Scott Armstrong) grew up doing American Revolutionary War re-enacting with my family so I have a particular interest in the re-enacting aspect. Our Borodino was the siege of Yorktown, which led to the surrender of Lord Cornwallis’ army, and eventually, to the end of the war which gave America her independence. I was fortunate enough to attend the 200th anniversary of that event with my father in 1981 and the 225th in 2006, this time with my own family as well as my father.\n\nAs I look at the photos and hear the stories about re-enacting the Napoleonic period, I am reminded of how much it looks like American Revolutionary War re-enacting here in the United States (although the Napoleonic re-enactors have better uniforms and more horses). During the US Bicentennial, my father and I spent many weekends traveling to re-enact on the various 200th anniversaries of battles of the American War for Independence. Growing up outside of Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, we were centrally located for events from Quebec, Canada to Savannah, Georgia. We even did re-enacting in France and later in England.\n\nWe are both still members of the Ist Continental Regiment from Pennsylvania. Growing up as a re-enactor gave me many unforgettable experiences: Parades in Philadelphia, New York City, and Paris (on the Champs Elysée), serving as an honor guard for a former US President (Ford), a battle at Dover castle in England, travelling in National Guard army trucks and, of course, participating in many battle re-enactments.\n\nThere were also other benefits to this hobby. All of those hours spent in the car with my father gave us much time to talk and be together. I also met my wife through re-enacting when she and her father joined our regiment. We became engaged at a re-enactment in Colonial Williamsburg and have since attended many re-enactments with our own family. ~ Scott Armstrong\n\nFaber du Faur’s unit passed back over the field on September 17 and was able to describe and paint the scene, “Here, close by, in all its horror, was the valley of the Shevardino, close to where Morand’s division had been positioned at the start of the battle. This is the battlefield long after the furious fighting had subsided, long after those violent passions had cooled, long after the powerful exclamations of honour and duty, which so stifle man’s humanity, had died away. Now the battlefield has assumed the aspect we see before us, the ferocious masses of troops having been called away to some other scene of victory, and the silence of the tomb reigns supreme. Bodies lie in heaps, enemy and friend alike united in profound peace. Here and there a horse is still moving, having survived its deceased rider.”\n\n“As we drew closer we could see that the corpses were, after eleven days, rotting away.”\n\n“Below darkened skies, bands of fog, as though out of compassion, shielded us from seeing more of this vast scene of desolation. Even so, we could plainly see the blood-soaked contours of the grand redoubt, the possession of which had been contested with such unabated fury. A column had been erected within the redoubt bearing an inscription to the effect that here lay Montbrun and Caulaincourt, surrounded by fallen heroes.”\n\n“The glory of our own troops was enshrined in these very redoubts, for it was here that Murat, overwhelmed by superior numbers, had sought shelter amongst us.”\n\n“Here, on this field, we inscribed in the pages of history that never-to-be-forgotten name of Borodino. No struggle had ever been so stubbornly contested; none had seen such numbers employed or such casualties on such a restricted area.”\n\n—\n\n“The bridge over the Kolotscha, situated just behind Borodino, was the scene of a bloody struggle on the 7th.”\n\n“The battle had opened with the seizure of Borodino village. The 106th Line Regiment had been ordered to storm the village. Having done so, they charged on over the bridge, towards the Gorki heights. There, met by superior numbers, and confronted by a murderous fire from Russian entrenchments, they were thrown back to the bridge, having sustained terrible casualties. The 92nd Line were rushed to their support, saving the bridge from destruction.”\n\n“During the battle the bridge had been cleared by throwing any corpses into the river. I saw that few now remained, hinting lightly at the terrible struggle that had taken place at this bridge over the Kolotscha.”\n\n—\n\nEleven days after the bloody battle we marched over the corpse-strewn field. Here the most horrific scenes lie far away in the distance and silence shrouds the countryside round about, for the angel of death had stalked this land.”\n\n“Those who fought at Borodino will recognize the picture, drawn from the main Moscow road and looking back on the scene of destruction. On the right, in the valley where the Slonetz meets the Kolotscha, is Borodino village, the dome of its church looking down sadly on the ruins of Semenovskii to the left. It was here, between these two points, that the battle was fought; the fight was bitter but our troops were ultimately victorious.”\n\n—\n\nNote that in the images above, all of the bodies have bare feet. By now, having marched hundreds of miles across Europe, shoes were in short supply. Aubin Dutheillet, a 21-year-old lieutenant with the 57th Line Regiment of I Corps wrote that during the battle, “General Teste’s ADC suffered the same fate [killed]; and by this time I was so short of footwear I stripped the unfortunate ADC, still not cold, of the boots he had on his feet to put them on my own!”\n\nSources:\n\nWith Napoleon in Russia: The Illustrated Memoirs of Faber du Faur, Edited by Jonathan North\n\n1812: Napoleon’s Invasion of Russia, Paul Britten Austin, p. 275\n\nOften in battle, there are differing views on what actually happened. Faber du Faur and Philippe-Paul de Ségur both described an incident involving Marshal Murat. However, their descriptions differed.\n\nFirst Faber du Faur who also painted the scene. “A long and bloody struggle was waged on the heights above the ruins of Semenovskii, for possession of the redoubts. Finally, towards noon, we secured the position after a combat of mixed success in which the redoubts were stormed, lost and stormed again. The redoubt on the right had fallen to the 25the Division as the battle raged at its fiercest. The enemy continually fed fresh troops into the fray and managed to turn back Murat’s repeated charges. It was during one such reverse that Murat, pursued by enemy cuirassiers, sought shelter, so as not to fall into the hands of the enemy, in the redoubt taken by the 25th Division. Here, contrary to what Segur has written, he came upon steady troops fresh from having taken possession of the position after a bloody struggle and who were prepared to defend the place to the last. These were the troops who would earn for their marshal the title ‘Prince of the Moskova’ [Ney] and win their general [Jean-Gabriel Marchand] the title ‘Count of the Empire.’ ”\n\n“A vigorous fire from our light infantry, and from line infantry in their support, soon repulsed the enemy’s cavalry and assured the safety of the King. He, Murat, threw himself upon the retreating foe with the cavalry of [General Jean-Pierre-Joseph] Bruyère and [General Étienne Marie Antoine Champion] Nansouty and, after a number of attacks, forced them back off the heights.”\n\nSo what did Ségur write? “The enemy’s cavalry, vigorously pressing their success, surrounded Murat, who had forgotten his own safety in an attempt to rally his men. Hands were already reaching out to seize him when he escaped by leaping into the redoubt, where he found only a few distracted soldiers, completely out of control and racing wildly around the parapet. The only thing that prevented them from running away was the lack of an exit.”\n\n“The presence of the King [Murat] and his shouts restored the courage of some of the men. He seized a weapon himself, and fighting with one hand, held his plumed hat up with the other and waved it as a sign to his men who rallied to the authority of his example. Meanwhile Ney had re-formed his divisions, stopped the Russian cuirassiers with his fire and spread disorder in their ranks. They fell back: Murat was finally rescued, and the knoll retaken.”\n\n“No sooner had the King got himself out of this danger than he rushed into another. He charged the enemy with the cavalry of Bruyères and Nansouty, and by a series of stubbornly repeated attacks succeeded in breaking their line and pushing them back toward the centre, concluding within an hour the defeat of the entire left flank.”\n\nYou can see the complete Borodino Panorama by following this link.\n\nNansouty was wounded in the knee at Borodino.\n\nSources:\n\nWith Napoleon in Russia: The Illustrated Memoirs of Major Faber du Faur, 1812, Edited by Jonathan North\n\nNapoleon’s Russian Campaign, Philippe-Paul de Ségur"
