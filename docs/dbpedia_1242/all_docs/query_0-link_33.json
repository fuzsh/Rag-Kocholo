        "text": "Mathematicians dying during the war, whether in military action, detention, taking their own life or due to other factors has certainly interrupted mathematical research. However, this is only one of the most dramatic and visible manifestations of war's effect on the mathematical community --- there are many others. There is a well-researched book that deals with all aspects of mathematical life in Nazi Germany, both before and during WWII:\n\nSanford L. Segal, Mathematicians under the Nazis, Princenton University Press, 2003 (ISBN 0-691-00451-X)\n\nSpecifically on the question of Teichmüller's repugnant actions before the war, I would like to recommend\n\nM.R. Chowdhury, Landau and Teichmüller, Mathematical Intelligencer, vol. 17, no. 2, 1995\n\nThe author concludes that\n\nTeichmüller was instrumental in perpetrating a heinous crime, the Landau boycott, which destroyed not only a truly great man and mathematician but also a great mathematical center.\n\nAlthough this article focuses on Edmund Landau, of course he was not the only Göttingen professor affected by the Nazi doctrine of Aryan science, which through the infamous Berufsbeamtengesetz of 1933 eliminated other illustrious scientists from Göttingen, including Max Born, James Franck, Edward Teller, Eugene Wigner, Emmy Noether and Richard Courant. David Hilbert has famously remarked that as a consequence, mathematics in Göttingen does not exist any more (see this discussion of sources for the quote on the HSM stackexchange site).\n\nIf you are willing to explore the thesis that war is harmful to mathematical community, both World War I and World War II provide a lot of evidence. For example, French intellectual elite was decimated by the Great War and the country lost a whole generation of mathematicians. Several of Michèle Audin's books deal with these subjects.\n\nMichèle Audin, Fatou, Julia, Montel: The Great Prize of Mathematical Sciences of 1918, and beyond. Springer, 2011 (ISBN 978-3-642-17854-2)\n\nMichèle Audin, Jacques Feldbau, Topologe: Das Schicksal eines jüdischen Mathematikers (1914 - 1945). Springer, 2012 (ISBN 978-3-642-25803-9)\n\nWhen I was a student an idea was popular in Soviet Union that war moves science.\n\nI think this idea is correct in certain sense. If you include preparation to a war. Yes, some individual scientists were killed in action or in some other way as a result of the war. But on the other hand, if you mean by \"war\" the military competition in general, is not it clear that governments finance science, physics and mathematics first of all, to preserve their ability to develop top military technologies?\n\nI witnessed a real boom in mathematics and science education, and in financing research both in Soviet Union and in the USA during the Cold war, and have no doubts about the real reasons of this boom. Especially nuclear bombs and space technology convinced the governments and the public that one has to invest in fundamental science and mathematics. (I don't have to explain that the whole enterprise of space exploration is a byproduct of military technology development during the Cold war, and also Internet, by the way, and computers too).\n\nAnd examples from the earlier epochs in history are also ample and well-known. Governments financed research in Astronomy and Celestial mechanics in 18th century for the needs of navigation, to maintain their colonial empires, Napoleon created the principal French scientific centers, etc. There is no doubt that design of war machines gave jobs to physicists and mathematicians in Hellenistic times (Archimedes, for example).\n\nWar by itself is bad, of course. For science and for everything else. But preparation to war always was a powerful engine of development of science.\n\nEDIT. Why this point of view is widespread among the former Soviet mathematicians. Soviet Union was a much more militarized society than Western countries. This partially explains the strength of Soviet mathematics (and physics). In other sciences Soviet Union was much weaker. So one can say that Soviet math/science education was so good, and here so many jobs for mathematicians because Soviet Union was a militarized society. After the launch of the first satellite (a byproduct of development of ballistic missiles), Americans made huge investment to the exact sciences and science education.\n\nI assume that most people may put focus on Polish or Soviet Union mathematical society when talking about this topic, but I personally would like to bring to attention another country which also severely suffered from WWII, namely China, through the experience of a talented, well-known, but low-profile mathematician, Wei-Liang Chow. The citations below are all taken from:\n\nWilson, W. Stephen; Chern, S. S.; Abhyankar, Shreeram S.; Lang, Serge; Igusa, Jun-ichi (October 1996). \"Wei-Liang Chow\". Notices of the American Mathematical Society. 43 (10): p.1117–1124.\n\nChow had ceased his research for about ten years due to WWII, according to S. S. Chern:\n\n...The decline of Göttingen had the result of elevating Hamburg to a leading mathematical center in Germany. Her leading attraction was Emil Artin, the young professor who gave excellent lectures and whose interest extended over all areas of mathematics. Although WeiLiang was a Leipzig student, the German university system allowed him to live in Hamburg. Besides the contacts with Artin, he had a more important objective, which was to win the love of a young lady, Margot Victor. They were married in 1936, and I was fortunate to be present at the wedding.\n\nAfter their marriage Wei-Liang returned to China and became a professor of mathematics at the Central University in Nanking, then the Chinese capital. The next years China was at war, with the coastal provinces occupied by the Japanese. We next saw each other in 1946 in Shanghai after the war ended. In a decade of war years WeiLiang had practically stopped his mathematical activities, and the question was whether it was advisable or even possible for him to come back to mathematics.\n\nAccording to Jun-ichi Igusa, Chow was able to communicate with European mathematicians during the first few years of his stay in China as a Professor at the Central University in Nanking, but then the situation became worse:\n\nIn the later years of our meetings, Professorand Mrs. Chow often mentioned the time when they were in China. After their marriage in Hamburg in July of 1936, they left Nazi Germany for China, and Chow started teaching at the Central University in Nanjing in September of that year. However, only one year later they found that China was no better than Germany. Imperial Japan enlarged a small fight on July 7, 1937, at the Marco Polo Bridge near Beijing to a systematic invasion of China. On August 13 a skirmish occurred in Shanghai, and on December 13 the “Rape of Nanjing” started. Fortunately they escaped Nanjing in September of that year to Chow’s birthplace, Shanghai. Shanghai being an international city, they felt safer there. They told us, however, that Shanghai at that time was quite similar to the Shanghai described in S. Spielberg’s movie, Empire of the Sun. In the first two to three years in China, Chow was still able to communicate with mathematicians in Europe, especially with van der Waerden. However, during the remaining eight years before he came to the United States the situation became so bad that he was unable to continue his mathematics. He told us more than once that it was Professor Chern who encouraged and helped him to come back to mathematics. Chow came to the Institute for Advanced Study in Princeton in March of 1947 and to Hopkins in the fall of 1948. He went on to say that without Chern’s friendship that might not have taken place.\n\nBut miraculously, Chow managed to return to his work after the war and:\n\nHis return to mathematics was most successful; I would consider it a miracle. He began by spending the years 1947–49 at the Institute for Advanced Study, after which he accepted a position at Johns Hopkins University, from which he retired in 1977. At Johns Hopkins he served as chairman for more than ten years. He was also responsible for the American Journal of Mathematics, a Hopkins publication and the oldest American mathematical journal.\n\nAnd many of his most prominent results, like Chow's moving lemma(1956) and Chow-Kodaira Theorem, were discovered after his return.\n\nAdolf Lindenbaum was executed by the Gestapo in 1941. His work was mainly in the fields of logic and set theory. For example, he proved that if any two non-empty sets admit a surjection between one and the other, then the axiom of choice holds.\n\nAlfred Tarski mentions this in the preface of his book \"Cardinal Algebras\" to Lindenbaum,\n\nIt would be impossible for me to conclude this introduction without mentioning one more name - that of Adolf Lindenbaum, a former student and colleague of mine at the University of Warsaw. My close friend and collaborator for many years, he took a very active part in the earlier stages of the research which resulted in the present work, and the few references to his contributions that will be found in the book can hardly convey an adequate idea of the extent of my indebtedness. The wave of organized totalitarian barbarism engulfed this man of unusual intelligence and great talent - as it did millions of others.4\n\n4 Adolf Lindenbaum was killed by the Gestapo in 1941.\n\nThe book also has the following dedication, which clearly includes Lindenbaum:\n\nTo the memory of my friends and students murdered in Poland during the Second World War\n\nSee also Adolf Lindenbaum's biography on MacTutor History of Mathematics.\n\nThe question is really multifaceted so I add another answer. Sergei Akbarov explained in a comment:\n\nActually, I was asking about any war, not necessarily WWII.\n\nWWI was really devastating, especially for French mathematicians. A good reference is the book of Michele Audin \"Fatou, Julia, Montel\", mentioned in Victor's answer. The reason was apparently that the French drafted most of their young mathematicians to the army, unlike the Germans and the British. A whole generation of young mathematicians was lost. She also discusses the consequences of this for the French mathematics. (Not all consequences were negative for mathematics itself: for example the rise of Bourbaki can be traced to this.)\n\nIn WWII relatively few known Western European mathematicians were killed in action, but many died in the Holocaust which was certainly related to the war. There is a very good but little known source:\n\nAdolf Goodman, Univalent Functions, vol. II. The last chapter (Ch. 18) of this book contains a large list, with short biographies of mathematicians who died in the Holocaust.\n\nIn some sense Ramanujan's mathematical research was also interrupted by a WW1. For example in http://rsnr.royalsocietypublishing.org/content/48/1/107 (Ramanujan’s illness, by D.A.B. Young) we read:\n\nThese intentions were frustrated by the outbreak of war within four months of his arrival in England. Contact with much of continental mathematics abruptly ceased, and soon many Cambridge mathematicians, most significantly Littlewood, left on war service.\n\nAnother consequence, slower in impact but more serious for Ramanujan’s well being, was food shortages, especially of Indian comestibles. He was a Brahmin Hindu and a strict vegetarian, and although in coming to England he had com­promised certain Brahminical strictures including crossing the seas, he remained punctilious about dietary observance. In the absence of another Brahmin to cook for him, he had to buy and cook all his food. If he had established a routine in his life, he could have coped. But he was obsessional about his research, working for 30 hours at a stretch and then sleeping for 20. ‘Cooking only once a day or two’, as Alice Neville remembers his habit , must have resulted in malnutrition.\n\nAlso from the book http://www.springer.com/us/book/9783319255668 (My Search for Ramanujan, by K. Ono, A.D. Aczel):\n\nAnother reason why Hardy failed in his attempt to have Ramanujan elected a Fellow of Trinity College had to do with World War I... Hardy was opposed to war, even while he understood the necessity to defend Britain and the Continent from German aggression ... Then at some point during the war, he supported antiwar statements made by the eminent Cambridge logician Bertrand Russell, and that was enough to tar him with the pacifist brush. He was thus politically weakened and could not effectively fight for Ramanujan.\n\nRamanujan, humiliated and upset by the defeat of his nomination to become a fellow, also suffered physically. It was at this point that the wartime scarcity of fresh fruits and vegetables—the main staples of his vegetarian diet—began to affect his health adversely. He became desperately ill. Naturally heavy, he now lost weight. He talked less, even meeting his only main contact with the world, Hardy, less frequently.\n\nP.S. There is an interesting article about the impact of the First World War on mathematics: http://hal.upmc.fr/hal-00830121 (Placing World War I in the History of Mathematics, by David Aubin and Catherine Goldstein).\n\nAccording to the Wikipedia article, WWII brutally interfered in the work of Teichmüller several times, in several ruthless ways. The whole citation there from\n\nSegal, Sanford L. (2003). Mathematicians Under the Nazis. Princeton University Press. p. 450.\n\nis so significant that I decided to reproduce it here completely. I can hardly think of a more dramatic, controversial soul-heart-mind tearing destiny for a creative mathematician - or maybe anyone else too.\n\nOn 18 July 1939, Teichmüller was drafted into the Wehrmacht. He was originally only intended to do eight weeks training but World War II broke out before the eight weeks were up so he remained in the army, and took part in Operation Weserübung in April 1940. Afterwards, he was recalled to Berlin where he became involved in cryptographic work along with other mathematicians such as Ernst Witt, Georg Aumann, Alexander Aigner and Wolfgang Franz in the Cipher Department of the High Command of the Wehrmacht. In 1941, Bieberbach requested that Teichmüller be released from his military duties in order to continue teaching at the University of Berlin. This request was granted and he was able to teach at the university from 1942 to early 1943. However, after a state of totalen Krieg was declared in response to the German defeat at Stalingrad in February 1943, Teichmüller left his safe Berlin position and volunteered for combat on the Eastern Front, entering a unit which became involved in the Battle of Kursk. At the beginning of August, he received furlough when his unit reached Kharkov. By late August his unit had been surrounded by Soviet troops and largely wiped out, but in early September he attempted to rejoin them. He is reported to have reached somewhere east of the Dnieper, but west of Kharkov, (most likely Poltava) when he was killed in action on 11 September 1943."
