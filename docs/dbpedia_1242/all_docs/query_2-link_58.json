Yanova. \"LANGUAGE MEANS OF EXPRESSION OF FICTION ELEMENTS IN POLITICAL DISCOURSE.\" Bulletin of Udmurt University. Series History and Philology 31, no. 2 (May 11, 2021): 254–63. http://dx.doi.org/10.35634/2412-9534-2021-31-2-254-263.\n\nFull text\n\nAbstract:\n\nIn this article we consider the category of fiction in political discourse - its language expression and the reasons for its appearance. In the process of research, we found out that one of the most important language means of expressing fiction in political discourse is metaphor and all its manifestations in the text. Metaphors convey a special, fantastic perception of the world. But, besides metaphors, the use of metonymy, hyperbole, litotes, comparisons, epithets, etc. also helps to form the category of the fantastic. We will consider the use of elements of the fantastic in political discourse on the example of the famous book “Maxims and Thoughts of Saint Helena Prisoner” in which Count de Las Cases, who voluntarily followed Napoleon Bonaparte in his exile, captured the emperor's statements, his aphorisms, fragments of political speeches, etc. Napoleon Bonaparte created authorial myths about himself, his rule and his army (the Great Army, Grande Armee), captured in his political speeches, letters, maxims and appeals to soldiers and contemporaries. From a literary and linguistic point of view, the very form chosen by Napoleon to express his political and philosophical judgments - maxims, aphorisms - is of interest. The result of our research is that the category of the fantastic in the political discourse of the Napoleonic era is the place to be and includes the use of metaphors, epithets, hyperbole, grotesques, personification, special comparisons and repetitions, as well as allusions, reminiscences, explicit and hidden quoting.\n\nOcampo, Emilio. \"The attempt to rescue Napoleon with a submarine: fact or fiction?\" Napoleonica La Revue 11, no. 2 (2011): 11. http://dx.doi.org/10.3917/napo.112.0011.\n\nFull text\n\nDergacheva, I.

Norov, who was the hero of the war 1812, which he leads with Leo Tolstoy from the point of view of the direct participant in the battles with Napoleon. Analyzing then description of the events of the Patriotic War of 1812 in the novel of Leo Tolstoy “War and Peace”, A.S. Norov opposes them to a description which was made by the hero Yermolov of the war of 1812. The authors speculate that the polemics of A.S. Norov with the Leo Tolstoys’ point of view to the driving forces in the war of 1812 would not be so acute if it is considered in the categories of literary criticism, as a polemical discourse of the work with artistic fiction (the novel by Leo Tolstoy) with a work of documentary where fiction is excluded (wroks by A.S. Norov).\n\nPeterson, Brent O. \"German Nationalism after Napoleon: Caste and Regional Identities in Historical Fiction, 1815-1830.\" German Quarterly 68, no. 3 (1995): 287. http://dx.doi.org/10.2307/408244.\n\nFull text\n\nKHAKIMYANOVA, A.

The brave Bashkir people, who made up the most massive component of the irregular cavalry, also contributed to the victory. The participation of the Bashkirs in this war is a vivid example of loyalty to their duty, manifestation of courage and valor. The theme of the Patriotic War was reflected in history, fiction, the presence of the national cavalry is described in memoirs and works of fine art. This article is devoted to the topic of displaying it in Bashkir folklore. The heroic struggle of the Bashkir warriors as part of the Russian army against the troops of Napoleon is reproduced in various genres of Bashkir folk art, among which legends, legends, songs, legends and songs stand out. The theme is also presented in the epic and baits, the patriotic content of which shows the great changes that have taken place in the public life and spiritual culture of the people. In folklore works, a heroic image of a Bashkir warrior was created, in which the best character traits of the Bashkir people are summarized, and one can clearly trace the attitude of the people to the war, its participants and leaders. In 2022, Russia is celebrating the 210th anniversary of the victory in the Patriotic War of 1812. The relevance of this study lies in showing that despite the passage of more than two centuries separating us from these fateful events, the historical significance of folklore works of this period has not decreased. Painted with motifs of patriotism, the immortality of the people who stood up for their honor and freedom, works of folklore, as a memory of those heroic years, still live among the people and play an important role in the scientific and educational process and patriotic education.\n\nPodosokorsky, Nikolay N. \"The Book by J.B.A. Sharras about the Waterloo Campaign in F.M. Dostoevsky’s Novel “The Idiot”.\" Literary Fact, no. 4 (30) (2023): 128–47. http://dx.doi.org/10.22455/2541-8297-2023-30-128-147.\n\nFull text\n\nAbstract:\n\nThe article examines the role of the book by the outstanding military historian, Colonel J.B.A. Charras (1810–1865), “The History of the Campaign of 1815. Waterloo” (1857), in F.M. Dostoevsky’s novel “The Idiot” (1868). Dostoevsky bought this book in 1867 in Baden-Baden while working on his new novel. The political emigrant Charras, who had died just two years before the creation of the novel “The Idiot,” was by that time widely known in Europe and in Russia as one of the most principled and authoritative leaders not only of the French but also, in a broad sense, of the European democratic movement. The literary and political journal “Vremya,” published in the early 1860s by the brothers M.M. and F.M. Dostoevsky, was one of those that published materials about him. The article examines the biography of Charras as a military and political figure and his opposition to the regime of the Second Empire under Napoleon III. The first Russian translation of the work of the French historian was published in the same year 1868, as the novel “The Idiot”. Two characters of the novel, admirers of Napoleon (Prince Lev Myshkin and General Ardalion Ivolgin), critically mentioned the book of Charras during their conversation about Napoleon’s stay in Moscow in 1812. The characters of “The Idiot” have different assessments of the figure of the French emperor in comparison with Charras himself, which is due to their different views on history in general and the role of personality in history. It shows that the fictional story of General Ivolgin in the novel is largely based on the work of Charras, which is thus one of his main sources.\n\nSaint-Gelais, Richard. \"Orbites elliptiques de la proto-science-fiction québécoise : Napoléon Aubin et Louis-Joseph Doucet dans les parages de Cyrano de Bergerac et de Jules Verne.\" Études 27, no. 3 (August 10, 2006): 493–503. http://dx.doi.org/10.7202/013325ar.\n\nFull text\n\nAbstract:\n\nRésumé La science-fiction, au moment où elle était en passe de se constituer comme genre, s'est articulée à diverses formes discursives déjà bien instituées : récit de voyage imaginaire, conte philosophique, vulgarisation, etc. Cette effervescence interdiscursive de la « proto-science-fiction » s'est aussi accompagnée d'articulations intertextuelles, comme le montrent deux précurseurs de la science-fiction québécoise, « Mon voyage à la Lune » (1839) de Napoléon Aubin et « Lettre écrite de la Lune » (1911) de Louis-Joseph Doucet, qui se placent dans la mouvance, respectivement, de L'autre monde de Cyrano de Bergerac et du De la Terre à la Lune de Verne. Un examen de ces textes permet de montrer, à travers la transformation du rapport à leurs « modèles », la lente mise en place d'un espace générique cristallisé mais mouvant.\n\nMcEwan, Neil. \"Anthony Burgess:Nothing Like the Sun and Napoleon Symphony.\" In Perspective in British Historical Fiction Today, 79–104.

Ironically, in Western Europe, doctors began to explore the potential of steam bathing for treating ailments and improving health. In the West, public bathhouses were new and could be considered modern. In Russia they had always existed and were considered traditional. In 1812 a popular broadside depicted Napoleon suffering in the Russian banya. In his fiction, the author Fyodor Dostoevsky used the banya as a place of ambiguity: it was clean and dirty, pure and corrupt, a potential gateway to hell and salvation.\n\nCheyette, Bryan. \"3.

Oxford University Press, 2020. http://dx.doi.org/10.1093/actrade/9780198809951.003.0003.\n\nFull text\n\nAbstract:\n\nWith the destruction of ghetto gates by Napoleon Bonaparte’s army, actual ghettos were replaced by imagined ones. ‘Ghettos of the imagination’ explores 19th-century ghetto literature. This literature crossed borders—for example, the exportation of British writer Israel Zangwill’s bestselling fiction to America. Late 19th-century America saw a huge influx of Eastern European refugees fleeing pogroms, leading to the establishment of large urban Jewish communities in its cities. Early French and German ghetto literature portrayed the ghetto as romantic and culturally rich, and associated it with the past. By the end of the 19th century, the free-floating ghetto had moved to the present, across to America, and from Western Europe to Eastern Europe.\n\n\"The Sphinx of the European World.
