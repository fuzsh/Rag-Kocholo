        "text": "June 20th, 1940\n\nLibya - It is the task of the Air Force, in North Africa, to give the French the taste of victory. It feverishly prepares its offensive against the Regia\n\nAeronautica in Libya.\n\nAlthough it is necessary to save material and the ground echelons of most of the units whose planes have just crossed the Mediterranean have not yet arrived in North Africa, it will soon be possible (not counting the Naval Aviation units, nor the night fighter squadrons equipped with Potez 631s) to engage about 600 modern aircraft - and a hundred more will be available in the following weeks. Four Fighter Groups equipped with Curtiss H-75s (plus a fifth at the end of July) and four CGs with MS-406s (plus two more at the end of July). Five Bombardment Groups equipped with Martin 167s, five on LeO-451, two on DB-7 (plus two more in early July) [1]. Four reconnaissance groups,\n\nobservation and light attack: two on Potez 63-11, one on Martin 167 and one on MB-175 (plus one in July), to which must be added a Groupement de Marche des Armées de Tunisie, which brings together about fifty Potez 63-11s and 631s. Two Reconnaissance Groups are formed on MB-174/5/6 and Amiot 351/4 to cover the whole theatre of operations.\n\n.........\n\nThis is far larger to what the Italians can bring in ASI. As of June 20th, the Regia Aeronautica Command in Libya, based in Tripoli, only has 301 aircraft (90 fighters: 38 Fiat CR.32 and 52 Fiat CR.42, 103 bombers: 83 SM.79 and 20 SM.81, 34 ground support aircraft: 23 Ca.310bis and 11 Ba.65, 91 reconnaissance aircraft: 59 Ca.309 and 32 Ro.37bis).\n\n\"Sir Wavell's concern about Italian air power was not justified by the state of most of the Duce's air units - although the Allied command was unaware of this at the time, and the Air Force was embarking on a journey into the unknown. The whole program of re-equipping the Italian fighters had been delayed by problems with the brand new Macchi MC.200. The plane had suffered two unexplained fatal accidents in late April and had been temporarily banned from flying [2]. Macchi's engineers attributed the accidents to a vicious wingtip stall, and the problem would be corrected fairly quickly, but the aircraft - by far the most modern fighter of the Regia Aeronautica - would not be able to be put back into operational service until the end of August. These problems had caused a profound disorganization of the Italian fighter groups and the re-equipment of the fighter squadrons based in Africa (Libya and East Africa) had suffered a lot (thus, the fighter units on Fiat CR.32 were only beginning to receive Fiat CR.42s).\n\nOn the bomber side, if the three-engine Savoia-Marchetti SM.79, the best aircraft in in service in the Italian aviation, had good qualities, Libya lacked spare parts, ammunition and even bombs.\n\nThese factors explain the relative passivity of the Regia Aeronautica in Africa Settentrionale Italiana. After the war, some historians wrote that Italian squadrons were inferior to the Allied forces during the summer of 1940 due to their lack of initiative and aggressiveness. Such a judgment is largely biased, even if the reactions of the Italian high command were slow and predictable. In reality, the main problem faced by the Italian air force in the ASI was that it was not ready for war when Mussolini decided to enter the war on Germany's side and that the combined weight of the Allies' naval and air forces quickly made it impossible for them to reinforce units already deployed on the African continent.\n\nThe Regio Esercito (army) was no better off. There were very few anti-tank guns (which were not very effective against the armor of the French R-35, H-39 and D1 tanks), the artillery lacked ammunition, the troops lacked training...\n\nIf France had stopped fighting in June 1940, it is quite possible that the Italian forces in Africa could have been substantially strengthened and supplied, to the point of being able to launch an offensive against Egypt in September. But by September, the fate of the ASI was already settled. As Marshal Italo Balbo wrote in his last letter to his wife: \"The Duce has abandoned us, barefoot and defenseless, facing two armies with experience of modern warfare, with equipment just good enough to fight the Senusis and just and just enough supplies to get us killed in honor.\n\nMay he be damned, him and all his pro-German henchmen.\" (Patrick Facon, Histoire de l'Armée de l'Air dans la Deuxième Guerre Mondiale, Ed. Larivière, Paris, 1999)\n\nHaving a substantial superiority and being inspired by the German example, as it was in the fighters department (where pair formations replaced trios), the French Air Force will stop using its bombing aviation in small and inefficient groups.\n\nIn the offensive against Libya, the French air force will concentrate its offensive means. The Italian air force will not be able to do much to prevent the French bombers\n\nbombers from attacking the logistical installations in Tripolitania and Cyrenaica, starting with Tripoli and Benghazi.\n\nThese are very limited! At that time, there are only five berths in Tripoli, four for troop transports and... only one for oil tankers. In Benghazi, the figures are three for cargo ships and two for troop transports; there is no fuel depot and it takes up to four weeks to unload a tanker. In Tobruk, there are only light cranes and, as in Benghazi, three berths for cargo ships and two for troop transports. Along the Gulf of Sirte, there are strictly no ports. These poor logistical facilities, which are the only ones that could allow Libyan troops to receive reinforcements, are mostly within range of French bombers, and the others are at the mercy of British planes.\n\n[1] We must add to that two groups on Farman 222 and 223, old but operational, and one on old MB-200 and LeO-257, outdated.\n\n[2] Even if some units continued to use it until the end of June.\n\nJune 20th, 1940\n\nLoire Front\n\nNevers sector - The whole of the 9. PzD reaches the Loire and mounts an assault. The Germans finally succeed in forcing their way through and in the evening, the vanguards of the ID of the XXVI. AK reach Nevers.\n\nLa Charité sector - The side channel is crossed, the defenders, overwhelmed by the number, are pushed aside. The Germans continue, bypassing the nest of resistance of Sancergues, which their air force violently bombed. At the end of the road leading to Bourges, which forms the longest straight line in France [1], a battery gives a bit of hope for a while in front of vehicles that are heading west. However, it soon has to withdraw, as some motorcyclists advancing on Avord threatened to flank it.\n\nDuring the night, the French defenders fall back towards the south and the Massif Central, under the protection of the sacrificial chokepoints held by the last riflemen.\n\nIt is with the small garrison of one of these plugs that the grammar teacher and Rifleman 2nd class rifleman Léopold Senghor is taken prisoner. \"I had rage in my heart,\" he says,\n\n\"especially since I knew that France would continue to fight at all costs. But as the Senegalese expected to be sent to captivity, they found that the victors were furious, both because they had met resistance far more energetic than they had hoped and because they were held in check by \"black savages.\" Horrified, they understand that they are going to be shot. \"After the first moment of fear,\" says Senghor, \"we got together and decided to fall bravely, to refuse a blindfold (which was not offered to us) and to die shouting. Vive la France! And not one of us failed to do so.\"\n\nLéopold Senghor fell like the others, but the Germans, not wanting to \"get their hands by burying Blacks\", entrusted the task of burying the unfortunate to requisitioned civilians. It is one of these improvised gravediggers who notices that three of the Senegalese are still alive. The man takes the risk of alerting the hospital, and some brave nurses do not hesitate to come to recover the wounded. Senghor will recover - he recounts the rest, his recovery, his escape and his years in hiding, in his moving book Le Pays des Ombres, a story peppered with poems written in the middle of the war.\n\nCosne et Cours-sur-Loire sector - In this sector and further downstream, the German bridgeheads in the Haute-Loire threaten the VIIth Army and the Army of Paris with encirclement. These troops receive the order to withdraw the following night to the Cher. But before that, the day would see a lot of fighting.\n\nThe Alpine chasseurs counter-attack the bridgehead of Saint-Thibault without succeeding in reducing it. A new attempt at Cosne allows the Germans to gain a foothold there too, west of the Loire and to advance to the lateral canal. In the evening, the order to withdraw to the Cher is given.\n\nBriare sector - The Germans infiltrate in the middle of a light defense and cross the Loire Canal, forcing the defenders to retreat to the Sauldre River.\n\nGien sector - Informed of what was happening upstream, General Fougères decides to crush the bridgehead of Saint-Gondon to facilitate his next retreat: at dawn, he launches a counter-attack with his last reserves (II/107th RI, second battalion of the 126th RI), supported by the last R-35 tanks and well coordinated with a powerful and precise artillery fire. The defenders are crushed and those who did not cross the Loire are captured. Fougères takes back the initiative and the Germans do not make any serious attempt during the day. At nightfall, the retreat to the Cher river starts without opposition.\n\nSully-sur-Loire sector - During the night of the 19th to the 20th, the exhausted 3rd DLI withdraws, relieved by the 87th DIA, fresher after two days of rest, and reinforced in the meantime by the 19th BATS (autonomous battalion of Senegalese riflemen). The riflemen counter-attack at dawn and the rumor of the arrival of \"Senegalese savages\" triggers a panic in the ranks of the Germans, who abandon part of the ground they had conquered the day before. In spite of violent artillery bombardments, which set fire to what was still left of Sully, the Germans only keep a few blocks of houses on the south bank and were forced to establish defensive positions.\n\nThus, during the night of the 20th to the 21st, the 87th DIA is able to retreat without any interference from the enemy.\n\nChateauneuf-sur-Loire to Orléans sector - At dawn, the Germans launcha general attack. They enlarge their bridgehead of Jargeau, push back the 47th ID to the south, break through Châteauneuf and nibble away meter after meter until Tigy. All day, the French fight foot to foot and retreat in good order. At nightfall, it is a general retreat.\n\nOrléans to Beaugency sector - But it is Orleans in flames that remains the symbol of the battle of the Loire. The fighting ravages the city, reaching a degree of violence previously unknown in this war. To occupy a house or even a floor, people fight hand to hand, with knives. The defenders, who have found a reason to fight by listening to\n\nthe recent radio speeches of the government, are admirably led by an overexcited Baudouin, who does not hesitate to go to the front line. Cavaliers, Republican Guards,\n\ncolonials, infantrymen and reservists show an excessive and almost suicidal heroism.\n\nWith their ammunition exhausted, groups of Indochinese fight to the last with incendiary bottles and even rocks!\n\nAs for the reservists of the 1st Battalion of the 51st Regional Regiment, they are commanded by an elderly colonel who galvanizes his men before falling himself with some panache.\n\nIt was only a little later that we learned that it was in fact General Maxime Weygand. He had sent back to President Lebrun his Legion of Honor, with a note explaining that he no longer felt entitled to wear it since the arrest of Pétain. He added that he was powerless to prevent what he still considered \"a dangerous folly,\" he was preparing \"to die as a soldier and in honor.\" When he was informed of this end, De Gaulle said, as a funeral oration: \"He will have commanded the fire once in his life!\"\n\nAt nightfall, the French still control the southern outlets of Orléans when the order falls to execute the first stage of the retreat towards the Cher... This one will be carried out without difficulty, the 33. ID, exhausted and badly hit, does not even try to continue. Some elements, surrounded, will however be unable to retreat. This is how Joseph Darnand is taken prisoner at the head of his Corps Franc, \"demoralized,\" he claimed, \"by the announcement of Marshal Pétain's ouster\". Enlisted (he was 43 years old), this hero of the First War did not, however, intend to stop there.\n\nBlois sector - The German 9. ID crosses the Loire on inflatable rafts at several points, surprising the vigilance of the 84th DIA. Three bridgeheads are quickly enlarged while the German engineers are busy restoring the passage on the remains of the bridges. In the evening, the 84th DIA disengages and withdraws to the Cher river.\n\nAmboise to Angers sector - The German 28. ID arrives in Amboise during the night of the 19th to the 20th, thinking it would find an intact bridge spotted by the Luftwaffe: in fact, the bridge leads to an island in the middle of the river and the bridge going from the island to the south bank had been destroyed. Believing the French to have withdrawn during the night (like the previous eight days), the Germans try to cross the 20th at dawn, but they are pushed back by the rearguard of the 8th DLIC. A second attempt, in the afternoon, fails again.\n\nThe German vanguard arrives in Tours at 02:00. During the day, the 8th ID occupy the part of the city north of the Loire river. Artillery duels rage, destroying a part of the city and causing many fires, but the French guns have the upper hand. The German infantrymen do not attempt to cross at Tours (the 8. ID did not cross the Loire until the 22nd and 23rd, at Port-Boulet, in the wake of the 1. KD).\n\nIn the same way, in the Azay-le-Rideau sub-sector, the German vanguards that arrived at Langeais find the bridges destroyed and defended. The Germans are content to make a mock crossing to pin the 5th BLM (this one will only withdraw to the Vienne river on the 22nd).\n\nThe first detachments of the 1. KD arrive in Saumur during the night of the 19th to the 20th. The alert had been given, the Napoleon bridge had already been blown up and the railroad bridge was destroyed under the nose of the German vanguards. At Montsoreau, the bridge is blown up the same night at 01:15; the Germans retreated to Varennes. At Port-Boulet, the bridge does not blow up, but the German attack is repulsed by the defenders who seized a PaK-36. However, the charges do not work and the bridge remains intact. Faced with the failure of these coups de main the command of the 1. KD uses the day of the 20th to rest its men (and horses), exhausted after an exhausting stage.\n\nThe vanguard of the 1. ID arrives at 18:00. in front of Saint-Mathurin and Les Rosiers, facing the island of Gennes, to find that the bridges had already been blown up. A first attack on the island is launched shortly afterwards and ends in a bloody failure. A second attempt allows the Germans to gain a foothold on the island, but without overcoming the French resistance.\n\nThe vanguard of the 11. ID, commanded by Captain Stein, arrives at La Flèche in the afternoon. There, Stein calls the mayor of Angers and the prefect by telephone and summons them to surrender or the city would be bombed. Knowing that what counts is to prevent the Germans from crossing the Loire River, the French civilian leaders agree and accompany the first German units, which entered Angers around 18:00... but were still on the north bank of the river. The 1st and 3rd DLM, which are stationed in Angers, had passed south of the Loire since noon and lined up with the 9/11 engineering group between Béhuard and Ponts-de-Cé.\n\nFurious, Stein sees all the bridges blow up under his nose; the only consolation is that one of them was only partially destroyed.\n\nIn addition, several units come to complete the defense of the Loire in this sector:\n\n- between Champtocé-sur-Loire and Ingrandes, the 3rd DLC replenished by the aggregation of cavalrymen from the Angers depot (Saint-Laumer Group) to its core elements;\n\n- from Montjean-sur-Loire to Chalonnes-sur-Loire, the remains of the 236th and 237th DLI.\n\nAncenis to Nantes sector - Since the departure of the Jean-Bart, this sector has become secondary for the Germans. It is therefore quite quiet.\n\nThe bridges of Nantes are destroyed during the day, but at Saint-Nazaire, the ferry continues to operate and to transport detachments from all over the world arriving on the north bank. In the afternoon, six hundred Poles who had survived the fighting in Saint-Aubin reach Saint-Brévin. They are exhausted, but have saved their individual weapons and even some machine guns. Many of them volunteer to fight the Germans on the spot.\n\n[1] All the French car and tire manufacturers carried out their tests there until the end of the 40's.\n\nJune 20th, 1940\n\nLorraine - After two days of terrible fighting that destroyed the city center, the Germans take over Toul and take many prisoners. The 58th ID loses six of its nine battalions.\n\nThe 6th CA retreats to the surroundings of Charmes, on the Moselle river : it is still pressed in the north by the infantry divisions of the German 1st Army, and now notes that the neighboring French units are now guarding the Moselle facing south-west ! It is surrounded. Its leader, General Loizeau, feels that the end is near.\n\nWhat remained of the IInd Army tries to retreat eastwards, but the army is now cut off from the 6th CA and the IIIrd Army. Still retreating, the units of the IIIrd and Vth Armies reach the Baccarat, where the Dagnan, Chastenet and Girval divisions suffer new and heavy losses. Further east, the survivors of the 43rd CAF decide to entrench themselves on the plateau of the Donon: they have to abandon all their heavy equipment, which could not pass through these mountain roads, and lose their link with the neighbouring units.\n\nGeneral Prételat orders the commanders of the 2nd, 3rd, 5th and 8th Armies to continue to fight as long as they can; even if they are surrounded, they have to continue the fight to block as many of the enemy as possible. Once the ammunition is exhausted and movement is impossible, they are allowed to surrender...\n\nThe 6. PzD and the 20. ID mot launch fast groups against Epinal by several routes counting on speed and surprise to seize the city. They run up against the advanced defenses\n\ninstalled by the French west of the Moselle: at Xertigny, the cavalrymen of the 23rd GRCA put up heroic resistance to the armored vehicles and continue the street fighting until the evening (their leader, squadron leader de Saint-Sernin, is killed). The guns of the Epinal forts take on another column that was advancing from the southwest; this one did not insist.\n\nThe rail network is cut off more and more, due to the bombing by the German air force or because of its saturation by trains carrying troops, equipment and refugees, but until now the roads have remained passable: indeed, following orders from Mandel, the gendarmerie and the provost marshal are strictly monitoring the routes, and the\n\nLuftwaffe does not attack the road infrastructure, which must remain intact to allow the progression of the panzers! The tactic of the car groups to move only at night and to take cover during the day had allowed them to avoid losses until then.\n\nBut on June 20th, at dawn, the convoy of the 342nd transport company, which carries part of the 62nd ID, is spotted and attacked by the Luftwaffe south of Besançon: a large part of the trucks and coaches are destroyed by successive raids. The 62nd ID is dispersed: the 57th GRDI arrives in Lyon, the 250th RI is blocked south of Besançon, the 307th and 326th RI are still in rearguard around Saint-Dié, and the 52nd RAMD is on the roads, around Lure. The men will have to start walking again... As for the 70th ID, no means of transport transportation can be allocated to it for now.\n\nVosges - After very violent battles, the Col de la Schlucht finally falls. The ridge road conquered, the Germans continue their progression to seize the roads leading down from the passes: Gérardmer is threatened. Groupement Mack reaches Belfort, but its attack is blocked by the resistance of the French troops defending the city; Mack has to wait for the bulk of the 7th Army's infantry divisions to launch an attack in force.\n\nJune 20th, 1940\n\nFrench ports - In order to allow hundreds of thousands of men to leave France, a very large part of the French fleet is engaged in the Grand Déménagement. The majority of the evacuations is carried out by ships of the merchant fleet or the auxiliary fleet,;but warships or modest fishing boats or leisure craft will also participate in the evacuations.\n\nAs soon as the decision to continue fighting in NAF was made official, the Navy staff looked into the availability of merchant ships to ensure these evacuations; this responsibility was assumed by Vice-Admiral Muselier.\n\nIn the Channel and the Atlantic, the situation is relatively simple: in the first zone, evacuations from the Channel ports to Brittany and Great Britain involve almost all ships in a condition to go to sea, and these ships will continue to be used for this purpose until the end of the resistance in Brittany; in the second zone, the ports have been under the authority of the Navy for several days and all useful civilian ships (i.e. with the necessary range of action) were identified and requisitioned.\n\nIn the Mediterranean, the Navy relies first of all on its own forces and in particular on its auxiliary fleet, both the banana boats and the (relatively) large liners of the auxiliary cruiser divisions and the small cargo ships, trawlers and other yachts, patrol boats and dredgers, all of which have already been mobilized: by mid-June, these forces represent around thirty large ships and nearly 150 small ones. These vessels, depending on their profile, are used to transport men, equipment or as patrol vessels responsible for escorting convoys or guarding the approaches to ports, to counter the Italian submarine threat. Very quickly, Muselier identifies and requisitions a hundred or so other merchant ships (cargo ships, banana boats and other liners), which are immediately engaged in the evacuations. In addition to these ships, during the weeks of July, ships are recalled from from West Africa, the Atlantic, and even the Eastern Mediterranean [1], as well as a number of ships present in Great Britain at the end of June: transports initially responsible for taking to French troops in Great Britain to Morocco, or auxiliary patrol boats that had just participated in the Atlantic evacuations.\n\nIn addition to these French ships or those chartered by the French, many foreign ships were to participate in the Great Removal. In the Channel and the Atlantic, many British ships participate in June in the evacuation of Normandy, Brittany and Charente, of the British Expeditionary Force and their network of bases in France, as well as many Frenchmen. A good number of these ships continue to evacuate men from the Basque Country to England. In the Mediterranean, many British and Commonwealth ships present in Malta or Gibraltar, will be put at the disposal of the French Navy and will participate in the evacuations from the French mainland to NAF.\n\nAmong the other allied ships (not to mention the neutrals chartered by England), some Norwegians, Poles and even Danes will shuttle from one side of the Mediterranean to the other, but it was the Belgians who played the greatest role in the Grand Déménagement. After having participated in the rescue of the Belgian troops being reorganized in Brittany, the eight fast ships from the North Sea, supported by six cargo ships of the \"Ka\" and \"Mo\" classes and the Congo express Astrida, will participate in the evacuations of Belgian troops (Military Aeronautics, XVIIth CRAB), many French troops and a certain number of civilians (anti-Nazi refugees) from the ports of Aquitaine and the Basque Country, before going to Southampton to embark the units of the former expeditionary corps in Norway to take them to Oran. There, they will join the diesel Copacabana, the cargo ship Carlier and the steamer Egypte to participate in the Great Mediterranean Déménagement.\n\nFinally, as necessity dictates, even the smallest ships present on both shores of the Mediterranean are requisitioned to participate in the Grand Déménagement. Starting in mid-June, nearly a hundred small trawlers are mobilized in Algeria, Tunisia, Languedoc-Roussillon, Corsica and Provence. In addition, the Navy very quickly put into action the 34 Italian trawlers seized in Tunisia on June 10th, armed by personnel repatriated from French depots. Most of these small boats will be going back and forth to Corsica during the whole month of July, but many of them will also participate in the last evacuations, in the first days or rather the first nights of August - they will then pay a heavy price to the Luftwaffe and Regia Aeronautica sweeps, sweeping the coasts every morning without encountering any air opposition.\n\nThe war fleet itself has to remain on the lookout to counter a possible sortie by the Italian fleet. Admiral Darlan keeps under his direct control the Force de Raid (Vice Admiral Gensoul), gathered at Mers-el-Kebir. Admiral Sud (Admiral Esteva) commands large forces, with the 3rd Squadron of Vice-Admiral Duplat based in Toulon (as long as the port was out of reach of the Germans) and four submarine squadrons; he is in charge of covering the coast between Nice and Corsica. In addition to numerous escort vessels and non-divisional avisos, four destroyer divisions (1st, 3rd, 4th and 11th), three smaller destroyer divisions (8th, 12th and 13th) and two squadrons of avisos (3rd and 4th) are used for convoy escorts. At the beginning of July, these units will be reinforced by part of the former Atlantic forces which will join the Mediterranean.\n\nThe Royal Navy will also participate in the escort of British ships involved in the Grand Déménagement in the Mediterranean, detaching not only several destroyers from Gibraltar (HMS Velox, Keppel etc.), but also cruiser HMS Arethusa.\n\n[1] They will cross the central Mediterranean taking advantage of the diversion caused by Operation BQ"
