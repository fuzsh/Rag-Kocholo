French postcard, no. C139. Photo: Catherine Deneuve, Michel Piccoli and Darry Cowl in Touche pas la femme blanche/Don't Touch the White Woman! (Marco Ferreri, 1974).

Elegant Catherine Deneuve (1943) is an icon of the French cinema who has graced the screen for more than five decades. She gained recognition in the 1960s for portraying cool, mysterious beauties in classic films by directors like Luis Buñuel, Roman Polanski and François Truffaut. Apart from being a great actress, she is also an archetype for Gallic Beauty. From 1985 to 1989, she succeeded Brigitte Bardot as the model for the national symbol Marianne, seen on French coins and stamps.

Michel Piccoli (1925-2020) was one of the most original and versatile French actors of the last half-century. He appeared in many different roles, from seducer to cop to a gangster to Pope in more than 200 films and TV films. Among the directors he worked with are Jean Renoir, Jean-Pierre Melville, Jean-Luc Godard, Agnès Varda, Luis Buñuel, and Alfred Hitchcock.

French comic actor and musician Darry Cowl (1925-2006) appeared in more than 150 films, often as a clown with a chronic stutter. Many of his comedies were not worth his talents, but at the end of his life, he made a glorious come-back and won the César twice.
