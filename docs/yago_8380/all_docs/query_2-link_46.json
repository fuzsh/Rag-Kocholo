        "text": "Of no film was it more rightly said: they don’t make them like that any more. Marco Ferreri’s La Grande Bouffe, from 1973 (or Blow-Out, to use its explosive English title) is on re-release. Jaded, authentically perverted, drenched in ennui, this absurdist nightmare is a locus classicus of 1970s chateau erotica. In all its seedy sophistication and degraded hedonism, it focuses not on desire but disgust. The nearest immediate comparison is possibly that episode of the Simpsons where Homer challenges trucker Red Barclay to a steak-eating contest which turns out to be fatal. There is also something here of Rabelais, De Sade and the surrealist Raymond Roussel, who believed in the subversive potential of eating the courses of a meal in the wrong order. Four middle-aged men gather for a weekend at a rambling Parisian townhouse – an airline pilot, a TV producer, a judge and a chef – and set out to treat themselves to what looks like an outrageous Roman feast, complete with fine wines and prostitutes. Actually what they want to do is eat themselves to death. Everything about this is grotesque and horrible, perhaps especially the elaborate haute cuisine of that period itself. Britain’s Fanny Cradock used to serve up continental food on TV that looked very similar. It’s a film of its time: crass and preposterous and a bit depressing but with a vinegary satirical tang, a parable for menopausal self-pity and babyish male conceit."
