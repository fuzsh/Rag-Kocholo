        "text": "Are the French taking over New York, or does it just seem that way? The an nual Rendez-Vous With French Cinema jamboree is under way through March 13 at its longtime home, Lincoln Center’s Walter Reade Theater, as well as the IFC Center, BAM Rose Cinemas and the French Institute Alliance Française. But that ain’t all.\n\nBAM is also unreeling, through March 31, a 25-film Catherine Deneuve festival. And her newest work, François Ozon’s “Potiche,” in which the 67-year-old grand dame appears opposite the rotund Gerard Depardieu, opens March 25 at the Paris theater.\n\nBut back to BAM. Its fest includes some of Deneuve’s best-known films, like Roman Polanski’s “Repulsion” (1965); the Jacques Demy musical “The Umbrellas of Cherbourg” (1964); François Truffaut’s “The Last Metro” (1980), also with Depardieu; and Luis Buñuel’s “Belle de Jour” (1967), with Deneuve as a wife and high-class hooker.\n\nThere also will be obscure films, such as Marco Ferreri’s farcical attack against the Vietnam War, “Don’t Touch the White Woman” (1974). One of her co-stars here is the late Marcello Mastroianni, a one-time lover, as Gen. George Armstrong Custer.\n\nIf you can see only one movie in the BAM fest, make it the brilliant “Repulsion,” with Deneuve as a young manicurist driven mad by her fear of sex.\n\nThe macabre ingredients include a plate of festering rabbit meat on a living-room table and grotesque raw potatoes on a kitchen counter. Plus exploding walls!\n\nBAM Rose Cinemas is at 30 Lafayette Ave., near Flatbush Avenue, in Brooklyn; bam.org.\n\n* Still more Gallic news: Truffaut’s “The Soft Skin” (1964) on Friday begins a one-week revival at Film Forum.\n\nIt’s the story of a married businessman (Jean Desailly) who finds himself in an affair with a much-younger airline hostess. She’s played by Françoise Dorléac, Deneuve’s elder sister, who died in a car crash three years after the film was made."
