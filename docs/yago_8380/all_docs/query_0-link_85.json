        "text": "Roberto Rossellini’s historical films can wear you down if you expect theatrical, melodramatic representations of History. The Taking of Power by Louis XIV (1966) is not your Queen Elizabeth movie, or Mary Queen of Scots, or Marie Antoinette. The moral or meaning of what we see is not pronounced but subtle and indirect. Grandiose moves and situations are smothered in physical and ritualistic detail. For example: “There are endless examples of this in The Taking of Power by Louis XIV, but one could single out the doctors’ examination of Mazarin at the beginning of the film and the extraordinary banquet that comes close to the end. As the doctors sniff Mazarin’s sweat, examine the contents of his chamber pot, and then bleed him, we are aware of the immediate physicality of a world before the flush toilet, deodorants, and modern medicine.” (Colin MacCabe, The Criterion Collection essay). In a way, nothing could more perfectly show the court of Louis XIV operate. More, one feels the historical events are being exhibited as they happened.\n\nDoes this claim too much?\n\nMy discomfort with all movies ‘inspired by real events’ – history, biography – originates in the de facto impossibility of replicating the past. Not just ‘accurately’. No, just by trying to. All compressed versions of events distort the historical adaptation, just as a film distorts adaptation of novel. And I haven’t – nor will I – touch on the many perspectives of the historical event being represented. I feel more comfortable (and believe these films are more ‘historically accurate’) with Marco Ferreri’s depiction of Custer’s Last Stand in Don’t Touch the White Woman (1974), Quentin Tarantino’s version of World War II in Inglorious Basterds (2009), and Oliver Stone’s rendition of the Kennedy assassination in JFK (1991). I distrust, especially, filmmakers who believe they are ‘capturing’ the past as it happened. The best intentions produce things like Glory (1989) and Lawrence of Arabia (1962), whose diversions from and alterations of the factual plane can never put it right.\n\nRossellini’s Louis XIV keeps musical high notes on the soundtrack to a minimum. While we wait for ‘something to happen’ it has probably already passed. No one thinks Louis has the ability to rule after Cardinal Mazarin dies. Fouquet prepares to be finance minister, with the aid of Louis’ mother, Anne of Austria. The move to Versailles from Paris begins Louis’s plan to combat these internal court forces. To consolidate power, the king determines that he must oversee all activities of the higher and lesser ministers. He initiates a morning-to-night ritual that structures access to himself. Divide and isolate those who are not on his side. The move is masterful and successful. Like the viewers of the film, Louis’ enemies barely realize they have witnessed their subordination to the king. We are also mesmerized. Neither the Sun King or Rossellini tip their hands.\n\nPerhaps the sense of an accurate historical reality is an illusion or, at best, a feeling (the film captures the emotions of the moment – it is this aspect of JFK that impacts the viewer as honest and authentic, but not so much the conspiracy theories outlined by Garrison/Stone). Rossellini creates a similar affectation in his neo-realist classics, Open City (1945), Paisan (1946), and Germany: Year Zero (1948). As Colin MacCabe states succinctly: “For the streets of Rome, he substituted the Palace of Versailles….” Thus, Louis XIV is played by Jean-Marie Patte, a non-professional actor who made one other film, minimizing any outside distractions to our response to Louis himself."
