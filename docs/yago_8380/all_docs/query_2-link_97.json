Based on the 1972 short story collection \"Erections, Ejaculation, Exhibitions, and General Tales of Ordinary Madness\" by Charles Bukowski. The first film adaptation of the author's work, and one of the most challenging films of the 1980s. Ben Gazzara and Ornelia Muti portray two self-destructive souls that become soulmates, hell-bent on sex, alcohol, and general torment. One of Gazzara's most unvarnished performances, having warmed up in the 1970s with a trio of Cassavetes films. 15.25 x 20.5 inches, rolled. Near Fine.\n\nFirst Edition. Quarto (28cm); mechanically reproduced sheets (rectos), velo-bound into powder grey card covers, with typed title label mounted to upper front cover; [i],[1],2-78,[1]pp. Signed by Bukowski in felt-tipped pen on the front cover. Light wear and gentle sunning to wrapper extremities; Near Fine. Screenplay for Marco Ferreri's 1981 film Storie di Ordinaria Follia, based on the stories in Bukowski's 1972 collectiom Erections, Ejaculations, Exhibitions and General Tales of Ordinary Madness. The film starred Ornella Muti alongside Ben Gazzara, who played the Bukowski figure \"Charles Serking.\" Uncommon, especially signed."
