(R. Pitman)[DVD Review—May 27, 2008—Koch Lorber, 124 min., in French w/English subtitles, NC-17, $19.98—Making its first appearance on DVD, 1973's La Grande Bouffe features a pretty nice transfer and Dolby Digital sound. The sole DVD extra is an excerpt from the documentary “Marco Ferreri: The Director Who Came from the Future.” Bottom line: a small extras package for a disappointing French farce.][Blu-ray/DVD Combo Review—Aug. 11, 2015—Arrow, 130 min., in French w/English subtitles, not rated, $39.95—Making its first appearance on Blu-ray, 1973's La Grande Bouffe features a nice transfer and an uncompressed stereo PCM soundtrack. Extras include select scene commentary by film scholar Pasquale Iannone (28 min.), “The Farcical Movie: Mario Ferreri” (27 min.) and “Forming Ferreri” (18 min.) on the director, a behind-the-scenes clip (11 min.), a “Colours Around a Festival” production segment (5 min.), a Cannes Film Festival news conference (2 min.), and a bonus DVD copy of the film. Bottom line: a minor French cult satire debuts on Blu-ray.]"
