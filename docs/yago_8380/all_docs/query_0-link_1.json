        "text": "General George A. Custer is attempting to repress the Indian resistance, but Buffalo Bill tries to steal the show…. A burlesque and anachronistic revisiting of the Battle of Little Bighorn transposed to the center of Paris and performed by a joyful cast lights the fuse of a glorious icon of American mythology. The political farce of the narrative collides with the real-life transformation of the modern capital, documenting the demolition of the ancient market of Les Halles. This parodic revenge Western film was shot against all odds; if La Grande Bouffe was Ferreri’s biggest success, Don’t Touch the White Woman! was his biggest commercial failure. 35mm print from Cinecittà.\n\nFor $30, receive one ticket to a film in Marco Ferreri: Beyond the Absurd and a select menu item at Café Paradiso, located in FLC’s Elinor Bunin Munroe Film Center.
