        "text": "A Boone Family\n\nJames Thomas Boone Samuel Lewis Boone James D. Boon\n\nThis is the story of my Boone family, beginning with my Great-Grandfather, James Thomas Boone. I've attempted to include not only the evidence and facts about this family, but also some of the background and history of the times. At the end of this page, there are links to other Boone-related sites which may be of interest.\n\nI didn't develop an interest in genealogy and family history while my Grandmother was alive, so I missed an opportunity to hear from her own lips about her father and his ancestors. But I grew up hearing that she was a Boone, and that we were related in some way to the famous Boone family. When I found my interest in genealogy, I began trying to discover what that relation was.\n\nHowever, recent DNA testing results indicate that my Boone ancestors were not from the George Boone (Daniel Boone) line. In fact, the results showed no matches with any of the Boones tested so far. This leads me to think that this Boone line is from one of the other Pennsylvania Boone lines, especially the German Boons. I plan to focus my research on these other lines, based on this new DNA evidence.\n\nWith that as background and introduction, here is what I've found about my Boone ancestors.\n\nJames Thomas Boone\n\nJames Thomas Boone\n\nMy Great-Grandfather was James Thomas Boone, born 25 September 18611 in Virginia. He married Margaret J. Mock, daughter of Frederick Mock and Nancy Helvie, in Delaware County, Indiana on 8 March, 1883 2 and had five children by her. Their children were Walter, Belle (my Grandmother), Ernest, Hazel, and Nannie. His first wife, Margaret, died on 4 January, 1896 and he married a second time to Ella Paxton. He had one son, George B. Boone, by her. He married a third time to Bertha Miller, and apparently had no children with her. He married a fourth time to Alice J. Warmoth after Bertha died. James died on 27 March 1951 at Altadena Lodge, Los Angeles County, California.\n\n1 Death Certificate, State of California, Reg. Dist. 1970, Registrar 74, File 4889,\n\nFiled 9 May, 1951\n\n2 Returns of Marriage, W-1, p 39, Delaware County, Indiana. Marriage License,\n\n8 March, 1883, Book C8, page 88.\n\nI spent several years trying to find the answers to two questions:\n\nWho were James Boone's parents? and\n\nWhat happened to him after his second marriage?\n\nTo answer the first question, I first began a search of Census records for a James Thomas Boone, whose parents were Samuel Boone and Sarah Bobo (as given in his marriage license application, shown below). I eventually found a marriage between a Samuel Boone and a Sarah Bobo that seemed to fit the time frame, if not the location shown in the marriage license application. They lived in Hardy County, Virginia, where they married in 1857. This seemed to answer the first question, although I didn't find a record of James' birth. Finding James in the 1880 Census was the best confirmation I'd found until I discovered his death record.\n\nDelaware County, Indiana, Marriage License.\n\nDelaware County, Indiana, Returns of Marriages, W-1, p 39.\n\n1880 Census, Stonewall District, Shenandoah County, Virginia\n\nSURNAME\n\nNAME\n\nAGE\n\nSEX\n\nREL\n\nS/M/W/D\n\nOCCUPATION\n\nBORN\n\nFATHER\n\nMOTHER\n\nLink\n\nJasper N.\n\n27\n\nm\n\nHead\n\nm\n\nBlack Smith\n\nWV\n\nWV\n\nWV\n\nLink\n\nEliza C.\n\n25\n\nf\n\nWife\n\nm\n\nKeeping House\n\nVA\n\nVA\n\nVA\n\nLink\n\nOmer N.\n\n3\n\nm\n\nSon\n\ns\n\nVA\n\nWV\n\nVA\n\nBoone\n\nJas. T.\n\n19\n\nm\n\nTenant\n\ns\n\nApp to Blacksmith\n\nOH\n\nWV\n\nWV\n\nJames was listed as an apprentice blacksmith, probably to Jasper Link, whose family he lived with. Jasper was the son of Isaac Link and Mary Landacre. After Isaac died, Mary married Samuel Boone, James' father. In 1880 the Link family was living in Shenandoah County, Virginia, just across the state line from Hardy County, West Virginia. There were several iron furnaces in that region, and a sizable number of people had emigrated to that area to work in the iron industry there. That's how James Boone became a blacksmith, the same trade that his grandfather James D. Boon had practiced. Note that he was said to be born in Ohio, and that his parents were both born in West Virginia, none of which is correct.\n\nThere is an interesting history of the iron furnaces in Shenandoah County at this link.\n\nThe second question was harder to answer. James' second wife, Ella, was referred to as his widow* in the 1900, 1910 and 1920 Censuses, and in the 1910 Ft. Wayne City Directory, so I searched for a record of James Boone's death. There was no mention of him in the WPA death index or the cemetery indexes for Delaware County. I found no obituary or death notice in the newspapers I scanned on microfilm. The Probate Court Order Books were silent about Boones during the period of September 1897 to 1901. In his father's 1906 will (see below), James isn't mentioned, which lent further support to the theory that James had predeceased his father.\n\n* Note: My grandmother, James and Margaret's daughter, was listed as a widow in the 1930 Census, even though her husband was alive and living in another place. He was listed in the Census as being married. It seems that for a woman to be living without her husband in those times was only respectable if he were dead, so the wife called herself a widow rather than separated or divorced.\n\nOne of my Boone cousins told me a story that has been passed down in the family regarding James Boone's death. The story is that James didn't die in 1899 or 1900. He had just found life with his new wife intolerable and had left. Divorce was almost unthinkable then, but desertion was not uncommon. The story says that James stayed near his family to see that his children were all right. His wife had referred to herself as his widow, no doubt to save face.\n\nIt seemed that James had either died without a record, or in another locality, or that he had left his second wife and gone away. I searched the indexes to the 1910 and 1920 Censuses, as well as the Social Security Death Index, without success. When the 1930 Census became available, I did a search for James Boone, and found someone in California who was a possible match. He was said to be 67 years old, born in Virginia, and living with his wife Bertha, who was 50 and born in Illinois. His age was off by about 2 years, and he was said to be born in Virginia, not Ohio, as was claimed in his marriage license application and in the 1880 Census.\n\nThis is the data from the 1930 Census record for James and Bertha Boone:\n\nCalifornia, Los Angeles County\n\nTwp ED Sht Surname Name Age Age 1st M Born Father Mother Occupation San Dimas 19 5B Boone James T. 67 45 Virginia Virginia Virginia Poultry farm San Dimas 19 5B Boone Bertha 52 20 Illinois Germany Germany None\n\nThen I did a search in the California Death Index, and found the following records:\n\nLast Name First Name Middle Birth Date Mother Maiden Father Last Sex Birth Place Death Place Residence Death Date SSN Age Boone James Thomas 09/25/1861 Bobo Boone M Virginia Los Angeles 03/27/1951 89 yrs Boone Bertha M 02/06/1880 Westfall Miller F Illinois Los Angeles 06/16/1943 63 yrs\n\nThis confirmed that this was indeed the correct James Thomas Boone. The year of birth was right, the place of birth was right, and the maiden name of his mother was the clincher. I sent for the death certificate, shown at the left, which gives his birth date and place, the names of his parents, his occupation, and his address at the time of his death. It gives the cause of death and further details, but which does not indicate whether James and Bertha had children. This information matches closely the information on his first marriage license application, and the other data about him from other sources.

The clerk of the Superior Court told me that there was no mention of James Thomas Boone in the index between 1950 and 1960. The San Dimas library did a search for an obituary for either James or Bertha, but found nothing.\n\nBertha's death certificate gave me the detailed information I needed to research her parents. Here is their record from the 1880 Census for Napierville, DuPage County, Illinois, Roll 204, p. 317D:\n\nRecently I found a marriage record for James and Bertha on the new FamilySearch.org site. They were married on 17 Feb 1904 in Dubuque County, Iowa. Both sets of parents were listed in the record:\n\ngroom: James Boone\n\nmarriage: 17 Feb 1904, Dubuque, Iowa\n\nage: 36\n\nfather: Samuel Boone\n\nmother: Sarah Boho\n\nspouse: Bertha Miller\n\nspouse's age: 25\n\nspouse's father: Ferdinand Miller\n\nspouse's mother: Henrietta Westfall\n\nThe Pomona librarian sent me some information from the 1930s in San Dimas. James was listed in the city directories covering San Dimas in 1931, 1934, and 1937-38:\n\n1931 Boone J T r rt 1 Allen\n\n1934 Boone J T r W Allen rt 1\n\n1937-38 Boone Jas T r W Allen av rt 1\n\nAt the present, West Allen Avenue runs parallel to California highway 30 between San Dimas Avenue and North Amelia Avenue. It looks like the street might have run further west previous to the construction of Interstate 210. There is an Allen Avenue west of there that ends at the San Dimas Wash.\n\nJames married for a fourth time after Bertha's death. A lookup volunteer transcribed the marriage record for James and Alice Josiephine Tapscott:\n\nMarriage License: #106, Book 2348, p. 24, City of Pomona\n\nJames Thomas Boone, naive of Virginia, white, age 75 residing at La Verne, and\n\nAlice Josiephine Tapscott, native of Illinois, white, age 73 residing at La Verne\n\n21 Mar 1945 J. F. Moroney, County Clerk\n\nCertificate of Marriage: I hereby certify that on the 21 Mar 1945 at Pomona city, Los Angeles, California under authority of a license issued by L. E. Lampton (sic) County Clerk, as a Police Judge of the City of Pomona, joined in marriage James Thomas Boone and Alice Josiephine Tapscott, in the presence of Madge Johnson, residing at Pomona CA.

White MD Years in County: 25; Years in CA: 25\n\nI also found this indication of James' political affiliation. Having come from West Virginia, and lived in Indiana for a time, his party membership is no surprise.\n\nIndex to Register of Voters, 1950:\n\nPomona City, Pct. 22 James T. Boone, 446 N. Reservoir Street, Republican\n\nI contacted the Pomona Public Library to ask for copies of the pages of the phone book or city directory for 1951 for the Boones, hoping to discover whether James and Bertha had any children. They kindly sent me the Boone listings for the city directory, and also the page from the crisss cross directory, which shows who was at that address (512 E. 2nd). This is the information I received:\n\nTelephone Directory, Pomona, Chino, Claremont, Laverne and San Dimas (August 1950):\n\nBoone, Abbott Col 2807 Indian Highway, Claremont\n\nBoone, Jack M 296 W Artesia, Pomona\n\nBoone, V L 1258 N Park, Pomona\n\nBoone's Fifth Avenue Market\n\nHouseholders' Directory (1951):\n\n2d, East, between Palomares and Linden\n\n512 Cowan R O\n\nCriss Cross Directory:\n\nCowan Robt O (Katie C) rooming hse 512 E 2d h same Pomona\n\nSo it appears that James was living in a rooming house at the time of his being taken to the Altadena Lodge, where he died. He wasn't listed in the 1950 phone book for either San Dimas or Pomona, or in the 1951 Pomona city directory.\n\nJames Boone's Children\n\nHazel, Walter\n\n& Belle\n\nNannie Boone\n\nEarnest Boone\n\nPauline & George,\n\nHazel Paulson\n\nAfter his first wife died, James put some of his children out to other families to raise. Ernest was adopted by Oscar and Rosa Harrison. My Grandmother, Belle, was adopted by Joel Green, a Baptist minister, and his wife Marilla. He had been the family's minister in Muncie. She lived with the Greens in Wells County, Indiana until her marriage to my Grandfather, Arthur Howard Hopkins. Nannie, the youngest child, also lived with the Greens for a time. After James married Ella, his eldest son, Walter, went to live with John and Amelia Campbell. He was described in the 1900 Census as their nephew. Amelia (Minerva) was a sister of Margaret Mock Boone. Walter later married, lived in Nebraska for a time, then moved to Houston, Texas. Hazel continued to live with her step-mother, both in Muncie and Ft. Wayne, for several years, along with James and Ella's son George. Hazel married Irwin Paulson, and lived with him in Maine and near Buffalo, New York, and in Florida after his retirement.\n\nThe photo at the right of George Boone and his wife Pauline was taken with Hazel Boone Paulson near Buffalo, New York in 1942. In the 1930 Census, I found George and Pauline Boone living in Lakeland, Polk County, Florida. He was listed as being 30 years of age, and working as a labor foreman.\n\nThese are scans of two pages of records that have come down to me about this Boone family. They are torn from having been folded and unfolded so many times, and there is a residue of an earlier attempt to tape one of the tears. But they are fairly legible, even at reduced size.\n\nSamuel Lewis Boone\n\nOn his marriage license application, James's father and mother were given as Samuel Boone and Sarah Bobo. 3 After an extensive search, I found a couple by those names who married in Hardy County, Virginia on September 1, 1857. Samuel L.* Boone was 26 when he married Sarah, and was recorded to be the son of Jas. D. & Cath. Boone and a native of Frederick County, Maryland. Sarah was 21 and was said to be the daughter of Thomas Bobo of Hardy County, and was a native of that county. The wedding was performed by Thomas Cottrell in Hardy County. 4\n\n* In the other records I've found pertaining to Samuel Boone, his middle name was either left off, or his initial only was given.\n\nBut in the marriage record of his son James to Alice Tapscott (see above), his middle name was given as Lewis.\n\n3 Returns of Marriage, W-1, p 39, Delaware County, IN.

He was apprenticed to Jasper Link, a blacksmith, who was James' step-brother.

In fact, Samuel was born in Maryland, his father in Pennsylvania, and his mother in Virginia.\n\nSamuel Boone's will was filed in Hampshire County, West Virginia. The will was signed on 10 Sep 1906 and probated on 10 Jul 1909. He describes himself as a shoemaker living in Rio, Hampshire County. In his will he mentions three children: John M. Boone, Mary C. Conrad, and Maudie M. Smith, wife of Ephraim Smith. He says he wishes to be buried in the cemetery in Rio. He makes no mention of his other children, including James Thomas Boone.\n\nS. L. Boone's Will\n\nIn the name of God, Amen: I S. L. Boone, of Rio, in the County of Hampshire, Shoemaker, being mindful of my mortality, do this 10th day of September, in the year of our Lord, 1906, make and publish this my last will and testament in manner following: First, I desire to be decently and privately buried in the Church yard at Rio, with as little expense as may be. Also, I give and bequeath unto my three children, John W. Boone, Mary C. Conrad, and Maudie M. Smith all my estate remaining at my decease after defraying necessary expenses in manner following, To John W. Boone, one third, to Mary C. Conrad, one third and to Maudie M. Smith one third, provided however, that if Ephraim Smith shall execute & fulfill the latter clause pf a verbal agreement between himself and me, Viz: That at my death, he, the said Ephraim Smith was to have my body decently buried at his own cost and expense. Now in case the said Smith shall perform his part of said agreement, then shall the bequests remain as above, but should he fail or refuse to comply then so much as is necessary to defray said expense shall be deducted from the portion of Maudie M. Smith and the balance if any paid to her. I give and bequeath to Mary C. Conrad One large portrait & frame of myself & wife forever. Any money paid by me to either of the legatees & not returned shall be computed in the settlement of the estate. I do hereby constitute and appoint my son John W.

Boon was a blacksmith by trade, and was Postmaster of the Baker's Run Post Office in the Capon district, Hardy County in 1851. He was born in Pennsylvania,5 moved first to Maryland, where he married and the first eight children listed below were born, then moved to Virginia. After several years in Virginia, the family moved (prior to 1860) to Fairfield Township, Tuscarawas County, Ohio, where James was a blacksmith, and a Justice of the Peace in 1862.6 He died there in 1869.\n\n5 1860 Census, Fairfield Twp, Tuscarawas County, Ohio, page 375.\n\n6 History of Tuscarawas County, Ohio p. 549\n\nJames Boon's Census Records\n\n1830 Census, Maryland, Frederick County, District 11, p. 161, ln 23\n\nSurname Name Males/Females Boon James H. 1M Under 5, 1M 30-40; 1F Under 5, 1F 20-30\n\nThe 1830 data fits James and his family at that time.

Executor having surplus left after paying of debts and being without power to pay it to the Widow except for her support invested $400.00 in purchasing 3 acres as a homestead for her use during life. He further reported that he took title to said 3 acres to himself as Executor and held the Same in trust for Said Widows use and her Daughters. He further reports that he expended $4.63 for Widows support and paid her $5.00 in money in support And herewith attaches Voucher for $43.63 thus expended for Widows support and use Said Vouchers being marked ABC&D.\n\n[Note: The foregoing is a partial transcription of the estate documents for James D. Boon. Note that none of James' sons were mentioned in his will or in these documents. His widow and daughters were provided for, but not the sons. I'm guessing that he had passed property to the sons prior to his death.]\n\nDescendants of James D. Boone\n\nI've prepared a pdf file that contains a register report for the descendants of James D. Boone. This file stops short of the living generations to protect their privacy. If you have anything to add to this report, or can offer corrections to the information in it, please contact me.\n\nI've been unable to find a record of James D. Boone earlier than his marriage to Catherine Smith, or to determine who his parents were. He is not listed in Spraker's history of the Boone family. I've also found no evidence that he's related to the English Boone family in Frederick County and vicinity, or to the German Bohun/Boone family of Frederick County. I'm now trying to trace him back to his birthplace in Pennsylvania, where the Censuses say he was born, and to find out who his parents were.\n\nOther Boone Information\n\nInformation from Scharf's History of Western Maryland relating to the Boone family.
