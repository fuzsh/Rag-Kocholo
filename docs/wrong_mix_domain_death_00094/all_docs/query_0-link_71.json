        "text": "[I tried to add this \"answer\" previously, but it doesn't show up in the thread, so perhaps I did something wrong. Anyway, second try:]\n\nBased mainly on the location of settlement in western Pennsylvania, why would this Thomas Beall son of WIlliam not be part of the Zephaniah & Colmore Beall crowd of Bealls? Colmore, per my notes, was born about 1762 in Frederick County, Maryland, and had a brother William very close in age; both sons of Mordecai Beall, whose will was proved in 1777 (recorded in Annapolis) through proved in Frederick County).\n\nWilliam is Beall-1283 on Wikitree, though no more information about him appears there. The profiles on him and his brothers include a transcription/abstract of their mother's 1786 will, but that abstract renders the name of William's brother incorrectly as \"Colman.\" It is correct, however, as \"Collmore\" Beall, in the note from the administration accounts on Elizabeth's profile.\n\nThis Colmore Beall, whose will was proved in Washington County, Pa. in 1829, named a son Thomas. While Thomas is a very common given name, at least this shows that the given name was present in this branch of Bealls.\n\nThe William Beall of whom I speak appears with a birth year of 1762 on FamilySearch. That profile (K23M-2R3) also posits that he is the William Beall who married Isabella Ramsey (license 8 March 1796). Most men didn't wait until age 34 to get married, so that might be a second marriage. That is a guess, but otherwise we can scarcely admit that William had a son Thomas in 1791. Perhaps Rachel was that first wife.\n\nI realize that the above theory conflicts with the item in the apparently unsourced \"Millennium File\" that the William Beall who was the father of your Thomas was born 19 June 1761, the son of a William and \"Hanah\" Beal. I have no idea what that might have been based on.\n\nRegardless of William's parentage, what happened to him after leaving Frederick County is a bit tricky due in part to the loss of the 1800 census of Virginia.\n\nThere is a William \"Bell\" on the 1800 census of Morgan Township, Greene County, Pa., very close to Beallsville, but there are several more people in the household than what one would normally expect for a man who had only been married for four years (if this was his first marriage), so I can't say that it's the same person. The township is littered with other Bell families, few of them living close to each other, so I have no idea of the relationships.\n\nThere is a William Beal on the 1810 census of Frederick County, Virginia, aged over 45 (which would fit our subject); also a male 16-25 (which would fit Thomas) and three females (one under ten and the others 16-25; I don't have enough other facts about the family to evaluate this aspect of the listing). For this to match, we would have to assume that Isabella had died by 1810.\n\nI don't have anything else to add other than to observe that in my opinion the William Bell whose will was proved in 1858 in Monongalia County cannot be the father of your Thomas. By all indications, the testator of 1858 was a much younger man. The will mentions four daughters, all unmarried, and no son Thomas. And based on the \"Bell\" spelling, he might not be related to you Thomas and William at all. I find Beall and Bell used interchangeably in census records for the Beall diaspora, but it's very rare to find a member of the Beall clan who will spell his surname \"Bell\" in a formal will.\n\n<!--[if gte mso 9]> <![endif]--><!--[if gte mso 9]> Normal 0 false false false EN-US X-NONE X-NONE <![endif]--><!--[if gte mso 9]> <![endif]--><!--[if gte mso 10]>\n\n/* Style Definitions */ table.MsoNormalTable {mso-style-name:\"Table Normal\"; mso-tstyle-rowband-size:0; mso-tstyle-colband-size:0; mso-style-noshow:yes; mso-style-priority:99; mso-style-parent:\"\"; mso-padding-alt:0in 5.4pt 0in 5.4pt; mso-para-margin-top:0in; mso-para-margin-right:0in; mso-para-margin-bottom:8.0pt; mso-para-margin-left:0in; line-height:107%; mso-pagination:widow-orphan; font-size:11.0pt; font-family:\"Calibri\",sans-serif; mso-ascii-font-family:Calibri; mso-ascii-theme-font:minor-latin; mso-hansi-font-family:Calibri; mso-hansi-theme-font:minor-latin; mso-bidi-font-family:\"Times New Roman\"; mso-bidi-theme-font:minor-bidi;} <![endif]-->"
