Out the gate, first servant of state!\n\n— Frederick the Great\n\n”\n\nFrederick the Great battled Ivan the Terrible following Alexander the Great and preceding Catherine the Great in Alexander the Great vs Ivan the Terrible. He was portrayed by EpicLLOYD.\n\nInformation on the rapper\n\nFrederick II, better known as Frederick the Great (German: Friedrich der Große), was born on January 24th, 1712, in Berlin, Prussia. He was King of Prussia from 1740 until 1786. His most significant accomplishments during his reign included his military victories, his reorganization of Prussian armies, his patronage of the Arts and the Enlightenment in Prussia, and his final success against great odds in the Seven Years' War. He died at the age of 74 on August 17th, 1786, in Potsdam, Prussia.\n\nLyrics\n\n[Note: Frederick the Great is in dark blue, Ivan the Terrible is in regular text, and additional voices are in italics.]\n\nVerse 1:\n\n(Psst!) What about a flute-busting Prussian?\n\nOld Fritz! Old Fritz! Old Fritz! Old Fritz!\n\nOld Fritz! Old Fritz! Old Fritz! Old Fritz!\n\nI'm Frederick the Great! Out the gate, first servant of state!\n\nOblique attack tactics ain't exactly straight!\n\nI've got creative talents and battle malice!\n\nHard as steel on the field, genteel in the palace!\n\nRussia's fucked up, but no wonder why!\n\nWith your tundras and taigas and bears! Oh my!\n\nI would pay a guy to tear out my eyes\n\nIf I had to look at your troll face every night!\n\nNow, bring me my chair!\n\nI'm weary from tearing you a new derrière from here to Red Square!\n\nFought a Seven Years' War; I ain't scared of a Tsar\n\n'Cause beating you only took me twelve bars!\n\nDuring Ivan the Terrible's third verse:\n\nI'd keep ripping you to shreds, but I'll take a break instead\n\nAnd just rest my little head. Why don't you drop dead, Fred?!\n\nTrivia\n\nFrederick is the eleventh rapper to die in-battle.\n\nHe is the second one to die peacefully, after Steve Jobs.\n\nHe, Jobs, and Billy Mays are the only characters who were not killed by another character.\n\nHe is the second rapper to step in later during the battle yet have their own title card, after Macho Man Randy Savage.\n\nHe is the first rapper with a title card to not be introduced by the announcer.\n\nHe is the only rapper in his battle who did not speak his own language, in this case, German.\n\nIvan the Terrible and Catherine the Great spoke Russian (\"на здоровье\" and \"нет\", respectively), and Alexander the Great spoke Greek (\"kudos\").\n\nHe was never good at speaking German however, and mostly preferred speaking French, which he does in the battle (\"derrière\").\n\nHe is the second rapper to have a chant or song at the beginning of his verse, after Walt Disney.\n\nHe is the fourth rapper to hold a title of \"the [blank],\" after Jack the Ripper, Ivan the Terrible and Alexander the Great.\n\nHe was good friends with (and possibly a lover to) French philosopher Voltaire, who previously appeared in Eastern Philosophers vs Western Philosophers.\n\nHis reign over Prussia overlapped with Catherine the Great's rule over Russia, both parties politically interacting with one another many times, such as signing diplomatic alliances between their two nations, as well as the partitioning of Poland. This makes Frederick II one of the few rappers to have interacted with another character from the same battle, in real life.\n\nThe stance in which he stands during his title card, with his left foot on his right leg, mimics Jethro Tull frontman and flautist Ian Anderson."
