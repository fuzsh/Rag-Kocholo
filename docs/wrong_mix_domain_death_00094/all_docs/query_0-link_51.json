        "text": "I can see the barest bones of an Ancestry tree for Anna Belle Snyder Ross. I am most interested in finding when she died. The part that isn't blurred out says she died in Sacramento, California, and her residence was in Alameda.\n\nI do know that she and her husband (Fred Ross) had two sons. The husband died in 1925, and the 1930 census showed the two boys living with their uncle, Sydney Ross. The natural question is, where was their mother? Was she also deceased?\n\nI am curious as to what happened to Anna Belle, and when. A personal diary of someone who had known Fred hints at something tragic and dire, but someone's diary is not exactly the most reliable source, especially when that person had many axes to grind.\n\nAnna Belle was Fred's second wife. I have not created profiles for either wife because I don't have enough reliable sources to do so.\n\nAnyway... if the source for Anna Belle's death in Sacramento offers a date of death, that might answer the question of why her sons were living with their uncle.\n\nAny helpful information would be very much appreciated. Thanks."
