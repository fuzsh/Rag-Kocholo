        "text": "I just finished doing my son-in-law's tree (By \"finished\" I mean \"going as far back as I could, then forward for all descendants until I decided finding BMD dates and places for a 4C2R wasn't really worth the effort\") and thought I'd share some of my findings. Amplifications and corrections warmly welcomed.\n\nNote 1, my genealogy program's report writer has a bug, so the source citations don't format properly. \"John Smith1-8\" should be \"John Smith (1-8)\" or \"John Smith 1-8\" with the \"1-8\" in superscript.\n\nNote 2, I marked everyone born after 1913 \"Living\" even though some are not.\n\nNote 3, the prose style is VERY mechanical.\n\n---------------------------------\n\nFirst Generation\n\n1.Jehiel Hull Kelley1-9 was born on 2 Apr 1829 in Ohio.He appeared in the census in 1850 in White River Twp, Randolph, Indiana.He appeared in the census in 1860 in Muncie, Delaware, Indiana.He appeared in the census in 1870 in Center Twp, Delaware, Indiana.He appeared in the census in 1880 in Muncie, Delaware, Indiana.He died on 4 Jan 1899.He was also known as Jahiel, Jehial, Johial, Johiel.He was buried in Tuscola, Douglas, Illinois - Cartwright Cem.\n\nDennis' marriage record says his father is \"J H Kelley\". Jehiel and Elizabeth have a child indexed as \"Jennis\" but whose name is really \"Dennis\", age 3/12, on the 1850 census taken 28 Aug 1850. He is with them, age 10, in the 1860. It would have been nice if Dennis had spelled out \"Jehiel\" on his marriage record, but Jehiel may have been going by \"J H\" for 10 years at that point.\n\nHere's their marriage record:\n\nGroom: Jehiel H Kelly\n\nBride: Elizabeth Lambert\n\nLicense: 26 Feb 1848, Randolph Co.\n\nMarriage: 26 Feb 1848, Randolph, Indiana\n\nSee Jehiel's mother, Mary Jones, for the 1850 census entry.\n\n1860, Muncie, Delaware, Indiana\n\nKelly, Johiel, 30, Ind, Brick maker\n\nKelly, Elizabeth, 30, Penn\n\nKelly, Mary M, 12, Ind\n\nKelly, Dennis, 10, Ind\n\nKelly, Marietta, 8, Ind\n\nKelly, Alonzo, 6, Ind\n\nKelly, Ida O, 4, Ind\n\nKelly, Malcolm, 2, Ind\n\nKelly, Sarah, 7/12, Ind\n\n1870, Center Twp (PO Muncie), Delaware, Indiana\n\nKelly, Jahiel H, 41, Ohio, brick maker\n\nKelly, Elizabeth W, 40, Penn\n\nKelly, Alonzo, 15, Ind, day labor\n\nKelly, Ida O, 13, Ind\n\nKelly, Melvin J, 11, Ind\n\nKelly, Sarah S, 9, Ind\n\nKelly, Franklin, 5, Ill\n\n1880, Muncie, Delaware, Indiana\n\nKelley, J.

See his grandmother, Mary Jones, for the complete census entry.\n\nIn 1870 Dennis is in Muncie with the Meeker family in the census taken 8 July 1870:\n\nHH 388\n\nMeeker, Henry, 43, Ohio\n\nMeeker, Ann, 38, Wnrttemberg / Wurttemberg\n\nMeeker, Willis B, 14, Ind\n\nMeeker, Laura J, 12, Ind\n\nMeeker, George A, 10, Ind\n\nMeeker, Julia A, 7, Ind\n\nThayer, Thomas, 23, Ohio\n\nKelly, Dennis, 20, Ohio, brick moulder\n\nGlendora, whose name is already Kelley, is 7 houses away, in HH 395, living with her mother, Sarah Trimble (McKenzie, Lennon).\n\nThey had just married:\n\nGroom: Dennis L Kelly\n\nGroom's Father: J H Kelly\n\nBride: Glendora Mckensey\n\nDate of License: 27 Jun 1870\n\nCounty of License: Delaware\n\nDate of Marriage: 27 Jul 1870\n\nPlace of Marriage: Delaware, Indiana\n\n1880, Muncie, Delaware, Indiana\n\nKelley, Dennis, 30, head, Ind, ---, ---, brick molder\n\nKelley, Glendora, 28, wife, Ind, Ohio, Ohio\n\nKelley, Bessie, 9, dau, Ark, Ind, Ind\n\nKelley, Elizabeth, 7, dau, Ind, Ind, Ind\n\nKelley, Lulu, 4, dau, Ind, Ind, Ind\n\nKelley, Carl, 2, son, Ind, Ind, Ind\n\nThese two entries (separated by some other Kelley entries) in the 1897 Muncie, Indiana, City Directory, stongly hint, but do not prove that Bertha was the daughter of Dennis and Glendora. \"h\" is the abbreviation for \"home\".\n\nKelley, Berthfitter, Tappan Shoe Mnfg Co, h 1133 e Washington\n\nKelley, Dennis (Glandora), engineer, J A Meeks h 1133 e Washington\n\nBertha's parents are Dennis and Glendora on the LDS Ancestral File and PRF; that isn't proof either. More research needed. Bertha isn't listed with them in the 1880.\n\nSee William Lowe, husband of daughter Bessie Kelley, for the 1900 census entry.\n\nThere is a Dennis Kelly, widowed, age 60, b. Indiana in Cogswell Creek, Lake, Oregon on the 1910 census. He is boarding with George and Myrtle Down. He could be our Dennis. He is the only Dennis Kelly/Kelley born 1848 - 1852 in Indiana on the 1910, but that is just a hint, not proof.\n\nDennis and Glendora are in the Muncie City directories in:\n\n1897: 1133 E.

Ohio; Glendora isn't listed.\n\nIn 1907 he and son Carl are both at 120 N. Ohio, both working at \"Meeks Handle Works\".\n\nI lose him after that; no death record, no obituary.\n\nDennis L Kelley and Zinelda Glendora McKenzie were married on 27 Jul 1870 in Delaware County, Indiana.Zinelda Glendora McKenzie1,11-13,15-17 (daughter of John P McKenzie and Sarah Trimble) was born in Jul 1851 in Indiana.She appeared in the census in 1860 in Muncie, Delaware, Indiana.She appeared in the census in 1870 in Muncie, Delaware, Indiana.She appeared in the census in 1880 in Muncie, Delaware, Indiana.She appeared in the census in 1900 in Muncie, Delaware, Indiana.She died in Jan 1905 in Muncie, Delaware, Indiana (prob).She was also known as McKensey, McKinzie.She has Ancestral File Number CM9P-LL.\n\nGlendora's surname is McKensey on one marriage record. She is \"Glendora M Kensey\" on another.\n\nShe is Zimelda Glendora on the older LDS databases.\n\nShe is \"Glondora Kelly\" and living with her mother in 1870, but John isn't there.\n\nThe LDS PRF has two children who, if they really were born to Dennis and Glendora, died young:\n\nJeheal Kelly\n\nBirth: 12 Aug 1889 Muncie, Delaware, Indiana\n\nInfant Kelly\n\nBirth: 6 Feb 1894 Muncie, Delaware, Indiana\n\nThe Muncie Public Library database of funeral home records has a bill for from the Meeks Funeral Home for Glendora Kelley, charged to Dennis L Kelley, for $70.00 for embalming, Burial permit $450, lining grave $100, 4 carriages, 1 Pall coach (fee blank).

It says, in part,\n\nGeorge E. Dungan, Secretary of the Muncie Savings and Loan Company and former Recorder of Delaware County, is a native of this county, a member of a pioneer family, and has lived here all his life. Mr. Dungan was born in Muncie on July 5, 1850, and is a son of John W. and Edith (Dragoo) Dungan.\n\nIt was on October 18, 1848, in Muncie, that John W. Dungan was united in marriage to Edith Dragoo. To that union were born nine children, five of whom are still living, the subject of this sketch having two sisters, Caroline, who married William Weeks, and Jessie F., who married George Carmichael, and two brothers, Leonidas and Harry F. Dungan.\n\nReared at Muncie, George E. Dungan received his schooling in the schools of that city and then went to Hartford City, where he served an apprenticeship to the harness-making trade, afterward returning to Muncie and here becoming engaged in the harness business. Four years later he became employed as a clerk in the Thomas H. Kirby grocery store and for six years thereafter was engaged in the grocery business on his own account.\n\nIn the meantime he had been giving proper attention to local political affairs and in 1898 was elected County Recorder. By re-election he served for eight years in that office and later, for three years, as President of the City Board of Works.\n\nIn the meantime, almost twenty years ago, Mr. Dungan had become a member of the Directorate of the Muncie Savings and Loan Company and in 1918 he was elected Secretary of this institution, which position he since has occupied, with offices at the southwest corner of Adams and High streets. Mr. Dungan is a Republican, a York Rite Mason and a member of the local camp of the Sons of Veterans.\n\nGeorge E.
