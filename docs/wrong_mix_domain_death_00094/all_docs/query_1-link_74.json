        "text": "Against his will, King Friedrich II of Prussia was originally buried at the instigation of Friedrich Wilhelm II next to his unloved father in the crypt of the Potsdam Garrison Church. In 1945, the two coffins were first brought to the Elisabeth Church in Marburg and then in 1952 to the chapel of Hohenzollern Castle.\n\nIn addition to Friedrich II., His dogs are also buried on Sanssouci.\n\nonline-destination.de/deutschland/potsdam/grab-friedrich.htmlHis grave on the top terrace of Sanssouci, where he found his final resting place - 205 years after the anniversary of his death - on August 17, 1991, is regularly decorated with potatoes. They lie on the grave slab to honor the king and because, it is said, Friedrich introduced the potato into his country with foresight and clairvoyance and also distributed it there. But that's a legend. He didn't do it, not in Germany and just as little in Prussia. And Friedrich did not eat any potatoes either, neither boiled nor fried nor mashed, as was proven in 1932.\n\nSource: spsg.de/blog/article/2017/08/17/kartoffeln-am-grab-zum-tod-friedrichs-des-grossen-in-sanssouci-am-17-august-1786\n\nHistory, culture and health can be combined in Potsdam in a short distance. On foot from Peter and Paul through the Dutch Quarter to Sanssouci.\n\nHere you can linger. There are three days to watch! On the other side, down the guard stairs, you go up the \"vineyard\" with its beautiful villas.\n\nOn the chaussee lined with linden trees to the north, we get back to the starting point, the parking lot behind Peter and Paul. A look at the Russian memorial on the occasion of the current war events since February 24, 2022 makes you think.\n\nPeace !\n\nThat's my greatest wish, at least for today!\n\nGrant us peace, Lord God, in our times!\n\nThere isn't anyone else who could fight for us,\n\nbecause you our God alone !!\n\nThis is how Martin Luther wrote it."
