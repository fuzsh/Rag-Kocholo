Accessed January 12, 2018.\n\nEditor’s Note: This article was commissioned by KMFA 89.5. An edited version of it was published on 01/17/18 here.\n\nBack in my university days, I had a pretty biased idea of how members of royalty used to co-exist with artists – they were merely the money. Sponsors of the finest composers, scientists, and writers of their era, but painfully oblivious to the genius developing around them. Whether it Charles VII or Henry VIII, all I could ever picture was Jefferey Jones in Amadeus (1984).\n\nForman, Miloš. Jefferey Jones as Emperor Joseph II in Amadeus, 1984.

Accessed January 11, 2018.\n\nBut my exaggerations are easily disproven! You only have to look as far as one of history’s most significant rulers, Frederick the Great of Prussia, to see a king that’s in direct contradiction of this stereotype. Frederick befriended, employed, and even worked alongside many important figures of the enlightenment. But among all the famous artists that Frederick connected with during his reign, there was one individual that he yearned for the most, and was ultimately his greatest disappointment: the French writer and philosopher, François-Marie Arouet, aka, Voltaire.\n\nThis week, Austin Baroque Orchestra touches on the doomed friendship of Voltaire and Frederick the Great with their performance, “When Freddie Met Frankie.” The show features composers that were employed by, or heroes of, the great king himself, including J.S and C.P.E Bach, Johann Adolph Hasse, Christoph Schaffrath, Carl Heinrich Graun, and more. The performance will be segmented by readings of the famous letters shared between Frederick and Voltaire.\n\nGreuze, Jean-Baptiste.

Accessed January 11, 2018.\n\nFrederick’s friendship with Voltaire was born out of a love for arts and culture. As a young prince, Frederick was swept away by the brilliant ideas that were spreading throughout Europe during the age of reason. Little Frederick started his own library with the help of his tutor Jacques Duhan, took flute lessons from Johann Joachim Quantz (he was pretty good at it too), and loved to wear gorgeous French-styled robes. This was all done in secret though, as these were hobby’s that enraged Frederick’s father, King Frederick William I.\n\nPesne, Antoine. Portrait of Frederick William I of Prussia, 1733. Painting. History Answers. https://www.historyanswers.co.uk/history-of-war/the-potsdam-giants-how-the-king-of-prussia-bred-an-army-of-super-soldiers/. Accessed January 11, 2018.\n\nFrederick William considered his son’s interests effeminate and “unsuited to a man.” He would often physically abuse and humiliate his son whenever he thought was appropriate, usually in public. Occasionally, he would catch Frederick in the act of doing something he despised and would react pretty harshly: he banished Duhan from Prussia, destroyed Frederick’s library, and threw his French clothes in the fire.\n\nFrederick tried to escape from Prussia and the abuse of his father a couple times as a teenager. His second escape in 1730 ended in his arrest and the very real possibility that his dad would cut off his head. But after being imprisoned for three months, Frederick William began to relax the conditions of the prince’s arrest, and gave him a lot more freedom when Frederick (begrudgingly) agreed to betroth himself to Elisabeth Christine of Brunswick-Wolfenbüttel-Bevern. Frederick William then allowed the Prince to live in a home of his own in the town of Neuruppin in 1732. It was there that he could finally have the freedom to start something that his father never allowed: a musical court.\n\nPesne, Antoine. Portrait of Elisabeth Christine of Brunswick-Wolfenbüttel-Bevern, 1739. Painting. “Elisabeth Christine of Brunswick-Wolfenbüttel-Bevern.” Wikipedia. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elisabeth_Christine_of_Brunswick-Wolfenb%C3%BCttel-Bevern. Accessed January 11, 2018.\n\nFor Frederick, music was more than just a distraction or source of entertainment, it was the great communicator of the emotions and the soul. After arriving in Neuruppin, Frederick quickly began assembling a super-group of instrumentalists. He got a hold of Carl Heinrich Graun, Michael Fredersdorff, brothers Franz and Johann Benda, and many others. All in all, Frederick’s Neurppin getaway would be outfitted with 17 musicians, adding many more when he was later crowned king.\n\nIt was during this harmonious period in his life that Frederick began his correspondence with Voltaire. Believing that he knew Voltaire intimately by being a longtime fan of his, Frederick randomly thought that he would appreciate french translations of the works of Christian Wolff.\n\nVoltaire was surprised to get a letter from the crown prince of Prussia, whom he’d never even met. More surprising was that the letter was dripping with compliments, as Frederick passionately wrote, “Your works are treasures of the mind…You alone are able to combine the wisdom of a philosopher, the talents of an historian and the brilliant imagination of a poet in the same person.”\n\nCamphausen, Wilhelm. Portrait of Frederick the Great, 1869. Painting. “Frederick the Great.” Wikipedia. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frederick_the_Great. Accessed January 11, 2018.\n\nVoltaire responded to the flattery two-fold, writing to Frederick that he was “a prince who thinks like a man, a royal philosopher who will make men happy…[Your] divine character….will be adorned by your people and cherished by the entire world.” The letter also calls Frederick “a Caesar,” “a Virgil,” “an Apollo,” “a Socrates.” The list goes on for a really long time.\n\nOne reason Voltaire was so complimentary was that he thought Frederick might be useful down the line. Voltaire was often in hot water with the aristocracy, his works were starting to loose popularity in France, and he was constantly in danger of persecution. It seemed like a good idea to be in the favor of a foreign sovereign, in case he needed a place to lay low. Regardless, the two hit it off and continued writing to each other for years. They would later have their first meeting during Frederick’s inaugural year as king.\n\nQuentin de La Tour, Maurice. Portrait of Voltaire, 1736.

Accessed January 11, 2018.\n\nAfter the death of Frederick William in 1740, the 28 year-old King Frederick II was able to fully embrace his love for the finer things in life. Immidiatly, he sent his Kapellmeister, Carl Heinrich Graun, to Italy so he could gather Opera singers. Meanwhile, he had his architect, Georg Knobelsdorff, construct a new opera house in Berlin. For the next 15 years Frederick dedicated himself to nearly all the aspects of running his opera, including the preparation of singers, librettos, rehearsals and even costumes.\n\nBesides musicians, Frederick also invited the finest minded individuals of Europe to come live with him in Potsdam as members of his court. His collection of celebrities included people like philosopher Christian Wolff, Swiss mathematician Leonhard Euler, and eventually Voltaire, who finally moved in with Frederick in 1750 after years of pleading from the king.\n\nZägel, Jörg. Frederick’s opera house as it stands today, now renamed the Berlin State Opera. “Berlin State Opera.” Wikipedia. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Berlin_State_Opera. Accessed January 10, 2018.\n\nFor a time, Voltaire and Frederick’s relationship in Potsdam was mutually beneficial. Through Frederick’s public admiration, Voltaire was given a status few other philosophers of the era had. Likewise, Voltaire helped spread the word of Frederick’s flattering image as a philosopher-king.\n\nUnfortunately, Potsdam just wasn’t big enough for the two of them. While Voltaire enjoyed the praise and luxuries that came with being a member of the king’s court, at the end of the day his job was mostly just to proofread and even rewrite Frederick’s awful attempts at French poetry. That and have dinner with him. This mundane way of life actually suited Voltaire every once in a while since it gave him a lot of time to work on his own writings, but eventually it was just too limiting for him. In speaking candidly about his proofreading reading position, Voltaire would say, ” Will he never get tired of sending me his dirty linen to wash?”\n\nSchobel, Georg.

Painting. “Atheist and gay, Frederick the Great was more radical than most leaders today.” The Spectator. https://www.spectator.co.uk/2015/10/frederick-the-great-king-of-prussia-is-a-great-read/. Accessed January 11, 2018.\n\nFredrick wasn’t too happy with his new roommate either. In one instance, Voltaire got involved in a international scam involving saxon war bonds, publicly embarrassing Frederick. Another time, he put himself at the center of an infamous intellectual feud between professor Johann Samual Koenig and Pierre Louis Moreau de Maupertuis. Long story short, it involved proving the existence of god with an algebraic formula, and it ended with a lot of open letters being written between the three of them about how stupid each other were. Frederick gathered all the copies of Voltaire’s dissenting comments and publicly burned them.\n\nWhen all was said and done, Frederick and Voltaire were glad, but sad to be rid of one another. In 1753, shortly before Voltaire was finally allowed to leave Prussia (he had to ask Frederick repeatedly), he wrote of the king that “I was enthusiastic about him for sixteen years, but he has cured me of this illness.”\n\nSchrader, Julius. Frederick the Great after the Battle of Kolin, 1900. Painting. “Frederick the Great.” Wikipedia. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frederick_the_Great. Accessed January 11, 2018.\n\nOn his way home in June 1753, Voltaire was apprehended in Frankfurt by Prussian authorities on order from Frederick. Apparently, he had illegally taken a private edition of Frederick’s poetry, though Voltaire claimed it was a gift. He was placed under house arrest for a month while Frederick’s goons seized all of Voltaire’s money and jewels. Also, as this was all taking place in the Free Imperial City of Frankfurt, not Prussia, this whole debacle was super illegal.\n\nVoltaire and Frederick would never again see one another, but only a year after the Frankfurt incident, they started writing each other again! They continued to do so for the rest of their lives. Frederick didn’t appreciate Voltaire’s personality, but loved the words he put on paper. Voltaire didn’t care for Frederick as a monarch, but loved the music-loving, philosophy nerd that he was underneath. Both of them learned to accept the half of each other they didn’t like – just as long as they didn’t live in the same country. In an age of reason, their friendship stood as a messy, passionate contradiction."
