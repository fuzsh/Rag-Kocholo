In love with designing since childhood, she received an education in Fashion Design at The Fashion Institute of Design and Merchandising, in Los Angeles. She then studied Theatrical Costume Design at Fullerton College. While there she studied with renowned costume designer Mela Hoyt-Heydon learning costume and millinery design. This enriching experience with a master in the profession would become crucial to her career development. Under Mela's tutelage she acquired an outstanding theatrical education from Fullerton College and received her BA in Theatrical Costume Design from Chapman University.

She thrives on the excitement and challenge of theatrical costume design. \"I love creating something from essentially nothing. I am rarely as happy as I am when I am sitting on the floor surrounded by fabric, sketches and my own craziness. I love pattern drafting, reworking period patterns and basically being a costume nerd and learning everything about a period I can.\"\n\nThe only thing that trumps her passion for the theatre is her love of her family. When she's not styling a fashion shoot or running around a theater she enjoys spending time with her amazing son Krystian and her invaluable family. Her family's endless support and inspiration are in every sketch, every fabric, and every stitch. Their love is the gift through which she can share her dreams and create new ones.\n\n\"I regard the theatre as the greatest of all art forms, the most immediate way in which a human being can share with another the sense of what it is to be a human being.\" Â— Oscar Wilde\n\nJORDAN BESWICK began his career in Casting as an Assistant to Douglas Aibel on James Gray's \"LITTLE ODESSA\", and Tim Robbins' \"DEAD MAN WALKING\".

In the past few years he has also become interested in classical Indian rhythmic and melodic systems.\n\nBorn in El Centro, California, but moving all around as child, to places like New Mexico, Texas, and the Los Angeles metropolitan area. Burns musical life began in Junior High School when he purchased his first bass with money from a paper route he had. At this time, he was immersed in the rock music of the time, but was quickly turned on to jazz by purchasing bassists, Jaco Pastorious and Stanley Clarkes first albums and classical Indian music by listening to Ravi Shankar. He received his formal education from Fullerton junior College (1991-1994), California Institute of the Arts (1994-97, BFA; 2006-08, MFA). He also studied privately with Wadada Leo Smith, Ralph Rose, Baba Elephante, Gary Willis, Aloke Dutta, Aashish Khan, Vinny Golia, and Jeff Berlin.\n\nAs an Improviser/Composer Burns has studied, Western European music, the classical music of North and South India, Ghana music of Africa, Japanese, Eastern European/Arabic music, and American Blues, Rock, and Jazz. He is working on notation systems that incorporate world music and jazz and open structures that give the musician freedom while also giving the composer his realized ideas.\n\nDaren has taught privately from his home and at Woodlowe Music in Woodland Hills, CA for over ten years. He is a member of the American Composers Forum and an ASCAP member.

He is a former member and co-captain of the National Champion Cal State University Fullerton gymnastics team. Larry also studied music at Fullerton and mastered in musical composition and arranging. He played in the college orchestra and various jazz ensemhbles as a bass player, both Upright and Electric. After college, Larry played professionally for 15 years.He eventually started teaching gymnastics again as a hobby and liked it so much that he decided to get into it as a full time coach in 1986. He ended up assisting Mark Young and Diane Amos over at West Valley Gymnastics in California, eventually working with Amy Chow. Diane liked a piece of music called Hernando's Hideaway, so Larry started putting together an original arrangement of the piece, playing each part and layering it together with the technology that existed back at that time. This was sometime back around 1992.Muriel Grossfield came out to the gym and worked with Diane putting together the floor routine.Everybody liked the music, so Larry and Diane began working on putting together music for the rest of the team. Pretty soon coaches and choreographers from other gyms started calling Larry to help them with putting together their music. It wasn't long before he was arranging pieces for other National Team members. Larry decided to form a business in April of 1994. Since he tailored music to fit individual floor routines, The Music Tailor seemed a fitting name for the business. Larry decided to come out out with Demo Cd's that the gymnastics community could listen to choose their music. His concept was to use his own arrangers and musicians. This was not an easy task, as he had to come up with a sound that would compete with high end studios with big budgets. Now, the company has expanded as is doing music for Aerobics, Ice Skating, and Fitness. Larry is also an artist and has a successful business in the field. The is a link to his artwork on this site. The Music Tailor is currently distributing around the world. It is quite exciting as we have expanded into Rhythmic music, Aerobic music, and Fitness music. In fact, we did the music for the 2000 Rhythmic Compulsories for the United States Gymnastics Federation.

She is of Mexican decent and is fluent in both English and Spanish. Eden knew from a young age that she wanted to be a singer, but it wasn't until her high school days that thoughts of Broadway began to creep into her mind. During her college years Eden attended Fullerton College and worked at several Southern California theme parks, where she played roles such as Ariel and Pocahontas. It was during this time that she was discovered by casting directors for Brooklyn (a.k.a. BKLYN), who then introduced her to John McDaniel and Jeff Calhoun. The rest, as they say, is history. Eden was off to NYC after a brief stop in Denver for the BKLYN workshop. Once in the city, much to her delight, she originated the title role of Brooklyn on Broadway. Her first Broadway appearance, however, was not for BKLYN, but for another show you may have heard of: Wicked. Eden was the understudy for Nessarose and the standby for Elphaba in the original cast of Stephen Schwartz and Winnie Holzman's Tony-award winning musical. She performed the lead role several times in Idina Menzel's absence, including a one month stretch while Menzel was out shooting the film Ask The Dust. Later, after BKLYN closed its Broadway run, Eden took over the role of Elphaba and was finally able to make it her own. We're so glad she did.\n\nThese days Eden is living once again in SoCal, and after nearly a year of starring as \"Elphaba\" in L.A.'s open-ended production of Wicked alongside former co-star, Megan Hilty, Eden is at present focusing on a career in film and television. Since her return to L.A., she has appeared in several television spots including turns on NBC's Law & Order and The Tonight Show with Jay Leno, cable's Robot Chicken, and ABC's Ugly Betty. Eden has also made several live appearances around town at shows like Upright Cabaret, The KTLA Morning Show, 88's Cabaret, and The Hollywood Santa Parade.\n\nAs far as music outside of the theater goes, Eden is a big fan of singer-songwriters like Eva Cassidy, John Mayer, and Dave Matthews. She also listens to a lot of her friends' indie CDs. When asked if she'd like to record her own music, Eden says, \"I'd like to record, and I've had a strong notion that I didn't want to do that till I had something to say, my own style, and my own niche.\"\n\nBorn February 2, 1978 in Anaheim, California, Eden is the daughter of Christian composer Eddie Espinosa.

Mr. Hatfield's body was found in bed shortly before the Righteous Brothers were to perform at Western Michigan University, Mr. Cohen said.\n\nMr. Hatfield and his partner in the Righteous Brothers, Bill Medley, were influenced by the intimate and expressive style of black soul singers, but unlike most previous white groups they sought to emulate the raw intensity of those singers. In hits like ''You've Lost That Lovin' Feelin','' ''Unchained Melody'' and ''(You're My) Soul and Inspiration,'' Mr. Medley and Mr. Hatfield channeled an emotional power that had rarely been heard in white pop.\n\nRobert Lee Hatfield was born in Beaver Dam, Wis., and grew up in Anaheim, Calif.\n\nMr. Hatfield attended Fullerton Junior College and Long Beach State University, both in California, and sang in groups that played at proms and fraternity dances. In 1962 Mr. Hatfield's group, the Variations, merged with Mr. Medley's, the Paramours. The men formed a duo later that year and reportedly took their name after a black fan exclaimed at one of their concerts, ''That was righteous, brothers.''\n\nUnlike Elvis Presley or Jerry Lee Lewis before them, the Righteous Brothers maintained a well-scrubbed image. ''Lovin' Feelin' '' was a No. 1 hit in 1965 and has become one of the most popular songs in radio history. A spokeswoman for BMI, the music-licensing organization, said that the song had been broadcast more than 10 million times in the United States. But ''Lovin' Feelin' '' was an unlikely hit. Before it was recorded, the Righteous Brothers had only minimal success; the group's biggest hit was ''Little Latin Lupe Lu,'' which was recorded for the Moonglow label in 1963 and reached No. 49 on the charts.\n\nPhil Spector signed the group to his Philles label in 1964 and wrote ''Lovin' Feelin' '' for them with his songwriting team of Barry Mann and Cynthia Weil. That hit was recorded with Mr. Spector's trademark ''wall of sound'' technique, with an abundance of instruments, including four acoustic guitars, three basses and three pianos. Mr. Medley sang the verses in a sonorous baritone and Mr. Hatfield joined in on the choruses with soaring harmonies.\n\nWorried that the song was too long to be played by D.J.'s, Mr. Spector listed a false running time on the record's label. Instead of its actual length of 3 minutes and 50 seconds, the last two digits were reversed, so the label read 3:05.\n\nThe Righteous Brothers recorded several more hits with Mr. Spector, including ''Unchained Melody,'' ''Ebb Tide'' and ''Just Once in My Life,'' before signing a million-dollar contract with Verve Records. At Verve the group recorded another Mann-Weil song, ''(You're My) Soul and Inspiration,'' with Mr. Medley as producer fastidiously recreating Mr. Spector's wall of sound. It became a No. 1 hit in 1966. In the mid-60's the group was also a regular act on the weekly television show ''Shindig!''\n\nThe group broke up in 1968 and for a short time Mr. Hatfield retained the name the Righteous Brothers on tour, with Jimmy Walker filling in for Mr. Medley.\n\nMr. Hatfield and Mr. Medley reunited in 1974 and had a No. 3 hit with ''Rock and Roll Heaven,'' a tribute to dead rock stars. Mr. Medley retired in 1976, but the two reunited again in 1983. The group was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in Cleveland in 2003.\n\nBorn in Southern California, I have been influenced by the vast array of colors, textures, and geology our state has to offer. I have always been interested in all kinds of Art. I attended Fullerton College as an Art Major. While in School I fell into Floral Design and worked as a Floral Designer for 14 years, creating living sculptures with natureÂ’s colors, textures, and fragrances, winning many competitions and awards along the way. In the last 15 years I decided to get back to my love of Art fulltime. I have showed at several galleries with different mediums. I have produced Art shows with a group, and also alone. During this time I have learned a multitude of very useful skills, and have been a self-employed artist for the past 12 years. I discovered Ceramics, and enjoy creating beautiful and sometimes quirky things that have a function. All of my pieces are either hand built using an extruder and a slab roller, or mold pressed. These items are food safe, liquid containing, and meant to be used Plein air painting is another passion, to be able to paint in the great outdoors is the best of both worlds. Being a bit of a color enthusiast most of my paintings be it pastel or oil are usually punched up a notch or two. My goal is to evoke positive feelings with whatever Art Form I am using, through Color, Texture and Design. The biggest dilemma I have is, not enough hours in the day to accommodate the ever growing mediums to work with. I want to experiment and try them all! Mediums Ceramics (sculptural & functional), Mosaics, Pastels, Oils, Papermaking (Asian &Western), Collage, Acrylics, Polymer Clay, Watercolors, Cement Carving, and Computer Graphics,\n\nAfter finishing Anaheim High School, Bob attended Fullerton College. Initially starting with just pre-med classes and a Theatre 101 class taught by George Archambeault, Arch soon talked him into appearing in a small role in \"The Taming of the Shrew\", and after that, he never looked back. A native of Southern California, Bob Lauder has been performing his entire adult life. He's shared the stage with Eric McCormack (Will and Grace), John Lithgow (Third Rock), Kristen Chenoweth, Robert Picardo (Star Trek Voyager), Cab Calloway, Joel Grey (Cabaret), Phyllis Diller, Marni Nixon, Marvin Hamlisch and comedian Red Buttons. He's had a National commercial running in the U.K. and was featured in the HBOFamily.com internet series \"Deadwood\". Bob had that sinking feeling but he survived the run as John B. Thayer in the 1st National Tour of \"Titanic, A New Musical\". L.A. audiences have seen him as the poet, Hajj in \"Kismet\" and Dr. Engel in \"The Student Prince\". He's also appeared as Ben Rumson in \"Paint Your Wagon\" and Juan Peron in \"Evita\" both earning him Dramalogue Awards, and as Michael in \"I Do! I Do!\" with his real-life wife Patti Diamond. An accomplished operatic baritone as well, he's sung across the country with opera companies such as Opera Pacific, Dayton Opera and Michigan Opera of Detroit, in roles as Marcello in \"La Bohéme\", Falstaff in Verdi's \"Falstaff\", Escamillo in \"Carmen\", Sharpless in \"Madama Butterfly\", Bottom in Benjamin Britton's \"A Midsummer Night's Dream\" and as Dr. Falke and Frank in a half dozen New Year's Eve productions of \"Die Fledermaus\". Together with his wife, Patti, they had a headline act for 6 years on Cruise Ships, and currently run Gate Crashers Entertainment, an event entertainment company out of Las Vegas. Lately, Bob bleaches his beard and hair white every year to sing and dance as Santa Claus in the Fashion Show Mall's Christmas Spectacular, \"Believe in the Magic\" in Las Vegas, NV with 10 showgirl elves who high-kick alongside him .

The answer to that question is easy - I’ve always wanted to be a singer. My grandma says that when I was three-years-old I used to sing bible songs I learned in church and my face would light up. When I was three and a half-years-old I had my first dance recital for tap and ballet class. Even back then, I loved performing on stage. During my childhood, my parents enrolled me in a Christian school located in Yorba Linda, California where I performed in the school’s church choirs and took Jazz, Ballet, Tap, and Gymnastics classes. I started writing lyrics and melodies at age nine.\n\nBy the time I was in junior high, I still wanted to sing but I also discovered I had a passion for acting, especially Musical Theatre. I auditioned for the Fullerton College Summer Theatre program for two summers called, Standing Room Only (SRO). In SRO, I performed and took college classes on singing, dancing and music theory. Additionally, I also performed in a few musicals with the Yorba Linda Community Theatre. In school, I was actively involved in the junior high Show Choir and Concert Choir and performed all over the county including the Richard Nixon Library, Disneyland, and Knott’s Berry Farm.\n\nAs I grew older, my desire to become a professional singer and share my God given talent with the world increased. It was clear to everyone around me that my first love was the arts. I knew I always wanted to inspire people and music gave me an outlet to express my feelings, overcome adversity, and make a difference in people’s lives.\n\nIn high school, my passion for the arts continued. I joined every choir the school offered - Concert Choir, Women’s Ensemble, Vocal Jazz, and Show Choir. I also joined the drama club and performed two One Act pieces. Starting sophomore year, I competed throughout the region in the award winning Company C show choir. At age 15, I was selected for the Young Americans (YA) and performed small variety shows throughout Southern California. At age 16, I was selected for Celebration Dinner Theatre in which I was a Singing & Dancing waitress at Cal Poly Pomona College.\n\nAt age 17, after high school graduation, I moved out on my own. I attended Fullerton College and participated in Bravo-Song and Dance Troupe, and was one of the worship Team Leaders at Canyon Hills Friends Church. My second semester of college, I moved to Northern California and performed in the local Musical Theatre program at College of Marin. I graduated with my Associate of Arts degree in Liberal Arts and Music. After completing my first degree, I wanted to find out what the Christian Bible belt music scene was like so I packed my bags and headed to Memphis, Tennessee where I attended Christian Brothers University (CBU) for my last two years of college. I was awarded scholarships for Music and Academics and I graduated with a degree in Information Technology Management and Music Performance.\n\nDuring my time at CBU, I competed in talent shows and performed all over Shelby County with the college choirs. As part of my degree requirements, I prepared and performed solo, a 15 set Senior recital that included pieces in Broadway, Jazz, and Gospel and classical pieces in Italian, German, and Latin.\n\nUpon graduation, I moved to Missouri to work for the Boeing Company, as I needed an income to support myself while pursuing my musical aspirations. Later, I returned to California. I have continued to sharpen my songwriting skills and seek out collaboration opportunities and have taken classes in Piano, Guitar, Ballet, Jazz and Hip-Hop. I perform whenever an opportunity strikes, whether it is for the CEO’s Christmas party at my work, weddings, or funerals.\n\nIn recent years, I competed at Lou Pearlman’s, Fashion Rock in Orlando, Florida and spent seven months at the L.A. Talent Academy ( LATA). I completed LATA workshops on singing, dancing, and performance techniques with industry professionals and performed in two showcases. I also competed in the Contemporary Christian vocal and songwriting categories at the Gospel Music Association (GMA) Music in the Rockies in Estes Park, Colorado. Most recently, I collaborated with an independent producer and wrote and recorded ten original Pop crossover Contemporary Christian songs.\n\nI have been praying for an opportunity to become a professional recording artist. If I get the chance to go on tour I would like to perform an entertaining, heart-felt, and inspiring show. I want to use my original songs to share my life-learned lessons with audiences and be a positive role model for young people. Through my own personal and spiritual life struggles, I have learned not to compromise personal values, to stay true to myself, and the importance of persevering to reach my goals and dreams. I would like to share this valuable message with my fans through my music.\n\nDavid Royer started Mojave Audio in 1985 in the garage of his house. The location was Fullerton, California, and Mojave Audio was a one-man, custom pro audio gear shop. David is best known for his ribbon microphone designs with Royer Labs, but he originally started out designing and building vacuum tube microphones, mic preamps and compressors for engineers in the Los Angeles area.\n\nSince the mid 1990's, David's custom Mojave products have been used on a number of well-known recordings and have achieved legendary status among a small circle of high-end engineers. Mojave Audio Inc. was launched in 2005 to bring David's condenser mic designs to the world.\n\nDavid Royer is one of an elite group of microphone designers who know that music and sound are inseparable from electronic design. Everything David designs comes from his deep, lifelong love of music.\n\nDavid's focus on sound started in his home, where he grew up absorbing the classical and folk music that his parents played constantly. From an early age, he was transfixed by the orchestral recordings he heard, leading to a love of classical music that continues today. At 21, David decided to create his own recordings and purchased an Ampex 960 tape recorder and a couple of off-the-shelf consumer microphones. Unhappy with his early results, he started experimenting with his microphones and soon began an in-depth, lifelong study of microphone design and electronic theory.\n\nAfter a four year hitch in the Navy, where he honed his skills in electronics and acoustics as a sonar technician, David started designing his own microphones. He founded a small company called Mojave Audio in his garage in Fullerton CA, where he modified amplifiers and made his own condenser microphones, mic preamps and compressors. Building gear under the Mojave and DVA labels, he created a number of condenser mics that have become studio staples among a small group of high-end audio engineers. In 1997 David designed his first ribbon microphone, The R-121, which led to the opening of Royer Labs in 1998. In a short period of time it became a breakthrough ribbon microphone that reintroduced ribbons to engineers around the world. David also designed a number of ribbon \"firsts,\" including phantom powered ribbons and tube ribbon mics.\n\nMy name is Jason Shipley and I attended your Art History Class about 3-4 years ago and it has still left a profound affect upon my life ever since. I thought I signed up for a just a regular history class and when I first attended your class I realized that this was an Art History class, but I remembered thinking what better way to learn about history then through Art.\n\nI was 22 years old and I was just attending night school for 2 classes purely for the knowledge (Art History and Philosophy), and I remember I really enjoyed the thoroughness of the way you had taught your class as well as the curriculum that was set up so that you could continue ahead if you wanted to.\n\nSince then I moved to Scottsdale, AZ and started my own Web Design Firm.

Now thats Art and Math rolled into one and why we make the big bucks. So just to reiterate what I just said , we take a custom design and make it look exactly the same in 5 different browsers (mediums).

I will try really hard to not bore you with all the predictable details, but since you might like to know a little about me, here goes!\n\nI was born in Provo Utah; in 1963 to two of the most amazing parents any one ever has a right to be born to. My father Dr Gary L. Shumway founded the Oral History program at Cal State Fullerton. Over the years his being willing to let me tag along on many an \"interviewing trip\" has without doubt helped instill in me wonder, and awe, at Life's unfolding journey. I have helped (more often than not with forebodings of capitol punishment) take these interviews and craft them into hundreds of family histories that Dad and I have published together.\n\nI studied Photography and Art at Fullerton College, and Orange Coast College, in Orange County Ca where I grew up. The time I spent in school was a wondrous time and I was blessed with insight, and experience as a result of these educational efforts. Working as a professional Photographer, is the only career I have ever known. It is hard to imagine that I have been at it for over twenty years now! I have had the good fortune over the course of this time, to work with, and along side of, some great people and creative minds. Way to many to name. Let me just say that I have been given a firm foundation with which to work. The main emphasis on choosing the path that I did was that I hoped it would give me the chance to express my self creatively. I would say that desire remains intact: whatever project I work on, in whatever medium, hopefully I am able to express something that is relevant, and creative. Part of the purpose of this website, is to correspond with other creative's, and really anyone who I might be able to help inspire, and share in the creative process with. So I invite you to get in touch with me, and in that context I will be able to share much more. I am anxious to be of service, and look forward to hearing from you.\n\nSincerely, Gary B. Shumway\n\nComing from a family of South Georgia Gospel Singers and musicians, Bob began playing trumpet at age nine after he heard his first Maynard Ferguson Album (\"Maynard Ferguson Plays Jazz for Dancing\"). The LP was made in 1956; he got it in 1959. All he can remember about that time is, after hearing \"Hey There\" on that LP, saying to himself. \"I want to do that!!!\" Bob studied with various teachers though most of his High School years. He began playing in bands, combos, and The Columbus (GA) Symphony while still in High School. He studied Music as a Music Major at UGA for three years until he was drafted and then spent nine years in the Navy.\n\nHe accepted a job at Hughes Space and Comm. in El Segundo, CA upon leaving the Navy. He started back playing music in LA in 1979. He met some really great players and singers in LA and became friends with many of the big time music people there. He played in clubs in LA, Anaheim, Sherman Oaks, Long Beach, etc. During his time in California, he finished a BS in Physics at Cal State Fullerton and was in the MS program at USC (University of Southern California). He also studied trumpet with Jim Linahon of Fullerton College and LMP Studios and attended many LA Jazz Workshops and Clinics. He moved back to Georgia in 1991 after becoming fed up with Southern California.\n\nBob had not played trumpet for thirteen or fourteen years until he met someone who encouraged him to come listen to a Big Band in Atlanta. He went with her one night to a rehearsal and got hooked again. Thanks to Past President and SJO founder, Henry Mason, for allowing him to continue to play and return to the music he loves through encouragement and friendship. It has been 4 years since he returned to playing the instrument he loves. Since then, he has really gotten back into playing Jazz and Musicals. He even takes trumpet lessons over the Internet with a fine instructor and player, Jeff Purtle! How kewl is that? Bob is a regular with several Big Bands and several Jazz Combos around Atlanta. \"Life is good againÂ”\n\nBob is currently an Account Support Advocate for Hewlett Packard."
