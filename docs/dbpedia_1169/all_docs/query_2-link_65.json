        "text": "Lyric Opera of Chicago, led by General Director, President & CEO Anthony Freud and Music Director Enrique Mazzola, today announces the company’s 2023/24 Season, which takes audiences on a global tour of opera featuring a richly curated slate of musical events in six different languages.\n\nThe company’s 69th season opens with Wagner’s The Flying Dutchman, conducted by Music Director Enrique Mazzola, who leads his first Wagner opera at Lyric. Directed by Christopher Alden, the production stars Tomasz Konieczny in the title role, Lyric favorite Tamara Wilson as Senta, and Robert Watson in his Lyric debut as Erik.\n\nThe season continues with a pair of operas offering contrasting emotional approaches to experiencing Lyric’s signature world-class vocalism. One of opera’s most delightful comedies, Donizetti’s The Daughter of the Regiment — back on the Lyric stage for the first time in 50 years — features the return of Lawrence Brownlee to Lyric as Tonio and the long-awaited Lyric debut of Lisette Oropesa as Marie. The iconic Laurent Pelly production is revived by Christian Räth and conducted by Speranza Scappucci both in their Lyric debut.\n\nIn repertory with the lighthearted Donizetti is one of opera’s most intense dramas, Janáček’s Jenůfa, starring two of the world’s most sensational sopranos: Lise Davidsen in the title role for her Lyric debut and Nina Stemme in her return to Lyric as the Kostelnička, Jenůfa’s stepmother. The production is conducted by Jakub Hrůša, the celebrated music director designate of London’s Royal Opera House and one of the world’s foremost experts in the Czech repertoire, and is directed by Claus Guth, both in their Lyric debuts.\n\nWinter brings another diverse pairing of operas to the Lyric stage. The witty and heartwarming comedy of Rossini’s Cinderella features the Lyric debuts of Vasilisa Berzhanskaya as Angelina and Jack Swanson as Ramiro, alongside returning favorites Alessandro Corbelli as Don Magnifico and Joshua Hopkins as Dandini. Conductor Yi-Chen Lin makes her Lyric debut, and the classic production of Jean-Pierre Ponnelle is revived by Crystal Manich, also in her Lyric debut.\n\nIn repertory with Cinderella is Champion, the \"opera in jazz\" who composed Terence Blanchard (last season’s hit Fire Shut Up in My Bones) and librettist Michael Cristofer. Champion tells the true story of Emile Griffith, a professional boxer from the U.S. Virgin Islands who threw a fatal punch in the boxing ring in 1962 after being taunted for his sexuality by his rival. Eric Owens is the older Emile, Justin Austin is Young Emile, and Whitney Morrison, an alumna of Lyric’s Patrick G. and Shirley W. Ryan Opera Center artist-development program, co-stars as Emelda Griffith, Emile’s mother. Music Director Enrique Mazzola conducts his first contemporary opera at Lyric, and James Robinson directs this new Lyric coproduction with the Metropolitan Opera.\n\nThe season continues with Verdi’s majestically scaled but intimate love story Aida, conducted by Music Director Enrique Mazzola. Michelle Bradley and Russell Thomas, the star-crossed lovers of last season’s Tosca, reunite as Aida and Radamès, another of opera’s famously doomed couples. Aida also heralds the return to Lyric of Jamie Barton as Amneris. The production, directed by Francesca Zambello, has designs by the contemporary visual artist RETNA, whose work uses calligraphy, hieroglyphics, and bold colors to evoke a mythic past with a contemporary edge. RETNA’s mural work can be seen locally in Chicago on the south wall of 33 East Congress, part of the Wabash Arts Corridor. Aida also features the Lyric debut of renowned modern dance choreographer Jessica Lang.\n\nWithin his run of Aida performances, Music Director Enrique Mazzola also leads two special performances of Mozart’s Requiem, a beloved masterpiece that puts the Lyric Opera Chorus and Orchestra center stage. The soloists for these performances will be announced in the coming months.\n\nTo commemorate the 2023/24 Season, musical theater’s biggest star will headline Lyric’s Season Opening Gala: An Evening with Audra McDonald on Friday, October 6, 2023. Andy Einhorn conducts the Lyric Opera Orchestra in an evening celebrating McDonald’s unique interpretive talents in a variety of song styles.\n\n\"Opera is at a very challenging moment, and I am proud of how our entire company is rising to that challenge every day. Despite the painful new economic realities of producing grand opera, Lyric will present a varied and compelling 2023/24 Season that keeps our main pillars front and center: presenting the best singers in the world, bringing exciting and thought-provoking large-scale productions to the stage, and offering fresh contemporary perspectives that point to the future of our beloved art form,\" says Freud. \"We are keeping our carefully built pipelines strong — both in terms of the artists we continue to mentor in our recently expanded Ryan Opera Center, and the new operas by new creators we continue to commission, workshop, and produce. We have a robust and responsible growth plan in place, and — as evidenced by our 2023/34 Season — artistic excellence will continue to be our guiding principle as we work to find the right balance between market demand and diversity of productions and the number of them on offer in each season.\"\n\n\"I am excited to be conducting such a profoundly diverse repertoire at Lyric next season: Wagner, Verdi, Mozart, and the brilliant Terence Blanchard, whose opera Champion is part of Lyric’s ongoing commitment to new works,\" says Mazzola. \"Stay tuned for ongoing news about the other new and recent operas Lyric will be commissioning and producing across future seasons. This is constant, essential work for the company and includes important pieces like Omar by Rhiannon Giddens and Michael Abels, The Listeners and Proving Up by Missy Mazzoli and Royce Vavrek, and the world premieres of the Lyric commissions of Safronia by avery r. young and H of H Playbook by Bryce Dessner and Anne Carson. Lyric is committed to remaining at the center of exploration and innovation in opera for many years to come.\"\n\nFor more information on Lyric’s 2023/24 Season, visit lyricopera.org/newseason\n\nLyric Opera of Chicago's 2023/24 Season Schedule\n\nThe Flying Dutchman * September 23–October 7, 2023\n\nSeason Opening Gala: An Evening with Audra McDonald * October 6, 2023\n\nThe Daughter of the Regiment * November 4–25, 2023\n\nJenůfa * November 12–26, 2023\n\nCinderella * January 21–February 10, 2024\n\nChampion * January 27–February 11, 2024\n\nAida * March 9–April 7, 2024\n\nMozart's Requiem * March 22 & 24, 2024\n\n(m) Matinee performance\n\n* Lyric Opera of Chicago debut\n\n+ Alumni of The Patrick G. and Shirley W.

Senta dreams of the Dutchman, who is cursed to wander the earth. He comes ashore every seven years, searching for a woman who will be faithful to him until death. When she meets him, Senta’s fate is sealed. The Flying Dutchman contains some of Wagner’s most magnificent and emotional music, including thrilling, spectacular choruses. Leading an outstanding cast are Tomasz Konieczny (previously the title role in Lyric’s spellbinding Wozzeck) and Tamara Wilson (the radiant heroine of Il trovatore and Ernani), in Christopher Alden’s electrifying production, with Music Director Enrique Mazzola conducting his first Wagner at Lyric.\n\nThe Dutchman * Tomasz Konieczny\n\nSenta * Tamara Wilson\n\nErik * Robert Watson*\n\nDaland * Mika Kares\n\nConductor\n\nEnrique Mazzola\n\nDirector\n\nChristopher Alden\n\nSet & Costume Designer\n\nAllen Moyer\n\nLighting Designer\n\nAnne Militello*\n\nChorus Master\n\nMichael Black\n\nProduction of Canadian Opera Company.\n\nLyric’s presentation of Wagner’s The Flying Dutchman is generously made possible by Josef & Margot Lakonishok and Bulley & Andrews.\n\nMaestro Enrique Mazzola is generously sponsored by Alice & John Butler, H.

Marie, the lovable, irrepressible, spirited heroine — a foundling, raised by soldiers — loves handsome Tonio. Things get complicated when the Marquise carts her off to refine her with a \"proper\" education. In one exhilarating number after another, Marie throws off coloratura flourishes like shooting stars, while her tenor sweetheart pops out nine high Cs in a single aria! Bel canto superstar Lawrence Brownlee and comedic veteran Alessandro Corbelli partner with the dazzling Lisette Oropesa in her eagerly awaited Lyric debut. The marvelously stylish Speranza Scappucci conducts Laurent Pelly’s quick-witted, uproarious production.\n\nMarie * Lisette Oropesa*\n\nTonio * Lawrence Brownlee\n\nMarquise * Ronnita Miller\n\nSulpice * Alessandro Corbelli\n\nConductor\n\nSperanza Scappucci*\n\nOriginal Director\n\nLaurent Pelly\n\nRevival Director\n\nChristian Räth*\n\nSet Designer\n\nChantal Thomas*\n\nCostume Designer\n\nLaurent Pelly\n\nLighting Designer\n\nJoël Adam*\n\nChorus Master\n\nMichael Black\n\nOriginal Choreographer\n\nLaura Scozzi\n\nRevival Choreographer\n\nKarine Girard\n\nCoproduction of the Metropolitan Opera, the Vienna State Opera, and the Royal Opera House, Covent Garden.\n\nLyric’s presentation of Donizetti’s The Daughter of the Regiment is generously made possible by Invenergy and Sonia Florian.\n\n* * *\n\nLeoš Janáček\n\nJenůfa\n\nNovember 12m, 15m, 18, 21, 26m, 2023\n\nSung in Czech with projected English title\n\nJanáček’s Jenůfa is a dark and stunning masterpiece, both musically and dramatically. In this profoundly moving story, the Kostelnička secretly drowns her foster daughter Jenůfa’s illegitimate child, hoping to save Jenůfa — and herself — from shame and humiliation. When the murder is discovered, the Kostelnička accepts the consequences, but Jenůfa ends the opera with hope for the future. Performing Janáček’s magnificent score will be an enthralling cast led by two of the finest dramatic sopranos of our time: opera’s newest superstar, Lise Davidsen, and the legendary Nina Stemme, Lyric’s sensational Elektra in 2019. Czech maestro Jakob Hrůša will bring unique authenticity to this unforgettable music, leading Claus Guth’s mesmerizing production.\n\nJenůfa * Lise Davidsen*\n\nThe Kostelnička * Nina Stemme\n\nLaca * Pavel Černoch*\n\nŠteva * Richard Trey Smagur*\n\nConductor\n\nJakob Hrůša*\n\nDirector\n\nClaus Guth*\n\nSet Designer\n\nMichael Levine\n\nCostume Designer\n\nGesine Völlm*\n\nLighting Designer\n\nJames Farncombe*\n\nVideo Designer\n\nrocafilm*\n\nChorus Master\n\nMichael Black\n\nChoreographer\n\nTeresa Rotemberg*\n\nProduction by the Royal Opera House, Covent Garden.\n\nLyric’s presentation of Janáček’s Jenůfa is presented by Julie & Roger Baskes with additional support from Richard O.

When Prince Ramiro (disguised as his own valet, Dandini) meets her, they fall instantly in love, leading — after a few complications — to a heartwarming happy ending. Rossini’s score provides endless sparkle, with Angelina’s and Ramiro’s arias abounding in fabulous vocal virtuosity. There is also hilarity, thanks to the antics of Magnifico and Dandini. Two rising stars, Vasilisa Berzhanskaya and Jack Swanson, will be joined by the incomparable Alessandro Corbelli to lead Lyric’s cast, in Jean-Pierre Ponnelle’s world-famous production led by the exciting Taiwanese conductor Yi-Chen Lin.\n\nAngelina (Cinderella) * Vasilisa Berzhanskaya*\n\nRamiro * Jack Swanson*\n\nDon Magnifico * Alessandro Corbelli\n\nDandini * Joshua Hopkins\n\nAlidoro * Nicholas Newton\n\nConductor\n\nYi-Chen Lin*\n\nOriginal Director\n\nJean-Pierre Ponnelle\n\nRevival Director\n\nCrystal Manich*\n\nSet & Costume Designer\n\nJean-Pierre Ponnelle\n\nLighting Designer\n\nDuane Schuler\n\nChorus Master\n\nMichael Black\n\nProduction owned by San Francisco Opera.\n\n* * *\n\nLyric premiere\n\nTerence Blanchard and Michael Cristofer\n\nChampion\n\nJanuary 27th, 31st (m), February 3rd, 6th, 9th, 11th (m), 2024\n\nSung in English with projected English titles\n\nBased on a true story, Champion unfolds in what composer Terence Blanchard calls \"an opera in jazz,\" featuring a libretto by Michael Cristofer. Welterweight boxer Emile Griffith is tortured by the complex realities of his life: decades-long guilt from defeating a challenger in the ring, who died from Griffith’s blows; and desperately conflicted feelings regarding his own sexuality. James Robinson’s production arrives in Chicago with a remarkable cast. Joining Lyric favorites Eric Owens, Whitney Morrison, and Paul Groves is Justin Austin, a brilliant new star who triumphed in Blanchard’s Fire Shut Up in My Bones, with Music Director Enrique Mazzola leading the Lyric Opera Orchestra.\n\nEmile Griffith * Eric Owens\n\nYoung Emile Griffith * Justin Austin\n\nEmelda Griffith * Whitney Morrison +\n\nLuis Griffith * Martin Luther Clark +\n\nHowie Albert * Paul Groves\n\nConductor\n\nEnrique Mazzola\n\nDirector\n\nJames Robinson\n\nSet Designer\n\nAllen Moyer\n\nCostume Designer\n\nMontana Levi Blanco*\n\nLighting Designer\n\nDonald Holder\n\nProjection Designer\n\nGreg Emetaz\n\nChorus Master\n\nMichael Black\n\nChoreographer\n\nCamille A.

While Aida delights audiences with its visual splendor, it also captivates them with a score ranging from exquisitely intimate arias to deeply dramatic duets and trios, and the most thrilling choruses Verdi ever composed. Aida presents a riveting love triangle, which unfolds in an alluring Egyptian setting. Each of the five principal artists in Lyric’s Aida boasts not only a sumptuously beautiful voice, but also the charismatic presence to bring these characters vividly to life. Conducting Francesca Zambello’s striking production will be Music Director Enrique Mazzola, acknowledged internationally as an exceptionally authoritative Verdian.\n\nAida * Michelle Bradley\n\nAmneris * Jamie Barton\n\nRadamès * Russell Thomas\n\nAmonasro * Reginald Smith, Jr.\n\nRamfis * Önay Köse*\n\nConductor\n\nEnrique Mazzola (March 9–April 1)\n\nFrancesco Milioto (April 4 & 7)\n\nDirector\n\nFrancesca Zambello\n\nArtistic Designer\n\nRETNA*\n\nSet Designer\n\nMichael Yeargan\n\nCostume Designer\n\nAnita Yavich\n\nLighting Designer\n\nMark McCullough\n\nChorus Master\n\nMichael Black\n\nChoreographer\n\nJessica Lang*\n\nA coproduction of San Francisco Opera, Washington National Opera, Seattle Opera, and Minnesota Opera.\n\nLyric’s presentation of Verdi’s Aida is generously made possible by Willkie Farr & Gallagher LLP, Liz Stiffel, Mr. and Mrs. William C.
