        "text": "The Wheatley School Alumni Association Newsletter # 33: July 15, 2019\n\nDear Wheatley Wildcats and Other Interested Persons,\n\nWelcome to The Wheatley School Alumni Association Newsletter # 33.\n\nThanks to our fabulous Webmaster, Keith Aufhauser (1963), you can regale yourself with the first thirty-two newsletters (and other Wheatley data and arcana) at http://www.wheatleyalumni.org/ Relatively new, and also thanks to Keith, is our handy-dandy, super-duper search feature, prominently displayed on our home page: type in a term or phrase and, voila, you’ll find it in all previous newsletters and other on-site material. Wow!\n\nConversely, if you are completely uninterested in Wheatley matters, please ask me to remove you from my distribution list.\n\nI edit all submissions, even material in quotes, for clarity and concision, without any indication thereof. I do not censor ideas, which often are not the same as mine.\n\nAdministrators\n\nFormer Principal Norman Boyan – Going Strong at 97\n\nWrites Wheatley’s first Principal – “Dear Art, I am most grateful for the Wheatley Newsletters because of their connection to a long ago past that has remained so wonderfully clear in this old head (97 years old last April 11; I recently celebrated my 76th wedding anniversary). Just great to learn that Wes Wathey is still with us, a truly treasured colleague who set his own special stamp on Wheatley. Be well and please continue your special work. Norm”\n\nFormer Principal Walter Wathey – Going Strong at 95\n\nI received the following voicemail from Mr. Wathey - “Hi, Arthur, this is Wes Wathey. Thank you very much for remembering my birthday. I’m 95, pushing towards 100. Do you think I’ll make it? I don’t know (laughs)! While we’re on the subject, I enjoy the Wheatley newsletters so much. They are insightful, clear, and contain wonderful information, and none of us will ever forget the history. My family and I celebrated my birthday quietly here at home. That my family was here was most important to me at this stage of the game. Thanks again. Bye now.”\n\nFormer Principal Rick Simon – Riding the River\n\nGraduates:\n\n1958 – Roberta Kaufman – Memorial Service\n\nA memorial service for Bobbie Kaufman was held on Saturday, July 13, 2019. She died this past Feb. 2nd.\n\n1958 – Barbara Newman – Still Winning\n\nWrites Barbara – “Me with my woman’s doubles partner accepting our 4th place winner ribbons at the Albuquerque National Senior Games……..great fun!\n\n1959 – Matthew Sanzone – Early Years at Wheatley\n\nTHE WHEATLEY STORY\n\n1956-1959\n\nChapter 1\n\nWilletts Road School\n\n1955-56\n\n“We’re moving;” these few words are unsettling words for most adolescents. For me over the first eight years of my formal education, three such pronouncements were uttered, which fostered some degree of turmoil in my life, so when we finally settled in East Williston, Willetts Road School was to become the fourth different school system in my pedagogic trail. I was not a North Sider, as our parents believed that the only way we, their three sons, would reach salvation was under the tutelage and hand (literally) of nuns in the local Catholic school. St. Aidan’s was the penultimate landing place once we moved to East Williston, the third Catholic school in my resume, concluding with grades seven and eight there. Now they probably had a good point in thinking that we needed a solid dose of religion, accompanied by a generous sprinkling of guilt, along with a heavy hand, to help us grow and mature into responsible citizens, and I am not second guessing them. However, three different orders of nuns, cloaked in three different habits in three different Catholic schools ,was more than enough.\n\nBy the time I reached St. Aidan’s I was well into wearing my black motorcycle jacket, which didn’t seem to endear me to the sisters of Halifax, but I was determined to continue the “hood” persona that I had been cultivating for the last two years while living in Queens Village. That jacket was my security blanket through my early adolescent miasma. St Aidan’s was the final destination, and the end came not a moment too soon as far as I was concerned. One very positive element of these pedagogical experiences is that they have provided a rich and unusually deep well from which to write satirical essays and humorous stories, a number of which I have penned. The ritual of confession, alone, is teeming with “tales of the box” that would make one shake one’s head in disbelief.\n\nSo, I was so happy to learn that my “Catholic” education was not to continue, and that I would be attending the Willetts Road School in September of 1955. My mother brought me to register early that fall, and it was agreed that I would take English, Social Studies, French, Science, Algebra, Physical Education, and lunch. It is said that first impressions and experiences can be lasting ones, and for me that is certainly true. My life in school was about to change in ways that I could not have predicted. First, I was going to have six different teachers and move about the school day into five different classrooms, plus the gym. I was to be free of the one classroom routine that I had labored through for eight years, each year staring at the bromide printed in bold letters on the top of the front blackboard: “An Idle Mind Is the Devil’s Workshop.” Further, I was moving from playing stickball on the asphalt streets in Queens to baseball on the grass and dirt of public school fields.\n\nMs. Bodnar, Mr. Visco, Mr. Frisone, Mr. Lineweaver, Mr. Devlin, and Mr. Brightman were my teachers, all brilliant and engaging. One thing I learned after a teaching career myself is that students remember not so much what you have taught them but how you taught them, and this was so true for all of my Wheatley School years. Dr. Boyan was our principal.\n\nI found it awkward fitting in, for so many of my new classmates had bonded through their North Side years. It was almost like I parachuted into the class without any knowledge of the environment. Luckily for me, my new teachers and new classmates made my adjustment relatively easy. “Adjustment” is an interesting descriptor. For me, after eight years of one classroom environment with forty plus pupils in every classroom, the freedom of my new schedule was overwhelming, and I didn’t handle it so well. First, there was no longer any fear of being wacked with a ruler or having my hair pulled or ear twisted, which are just a few of the medieval learning-reinforcement techniques employed by the “Sisters of Mercy.”\n\nThen there were teachers who actually had a sense of humor, and it was OK to laugh in class and not be laughed at for mispronouncing or misreading a word. My biggest problem was the poor fundamental education I brought with me to Willets Road School. I will always remember sitting in Mr. Lineweaver’s science class on my first day when a student asked if Mr. Lineweaver believed that science was still in its infancy. Well, right there and then I knew I was in over my head. Algebra may just as well have been hieroglyphics, because arithmetic was the extent of my background in that discipline. French! Not even close. I probably had a better chance studying Latin after all the Catholic masses I attended over my first fourteen years of existence, eight of them in a classroom in which my music education consisted of singing hymns in Latin. Ms. Bodnar was terrific and provided my first exposure to poetry. I actually wrote one that shocked her, causing her, I am sure, to scan the poetry indices of all her anthologies looking for my suspected plagiarism. My first and only “A”. Mr. Brightman encouraged me to join the track team, and that was a game changer for me. Lunch hour featured rock ‘n roll music played over the PA, and dancing was a regular activity. Imagine such a scene in Catholic school where rock ‘n roll was banned.\n\nOne lunch period I’ll never forget happened early in the school year. I mentioned that fitting in initially was not easy, and I did face one challenge that was unexpected, but one many boys encounter at some point in their adolescent lives. For some reason a classmate whom I did not know, and with whom I had little interaction (name omitted), was often teasing and mimicking me, until one day a “fight” was arranged by his friends (some of whom I wanted to befriend). Meet in the locker room during lunch was the challenge! I admit I was pretty nervous about it, because I still felt somewhat of an outsider, but I didn’t really have any choice. I decided to eat lunch first then go to the locker room. Miss lunch? Not a chance! Ken Goldman, future class president, kept me company, knowing that I was in the minority for this engagement. Word soon filtered back to the cafeteria that I was “chickening out,” so I went to meet my fate. There were six or seven friends of “he who will not be named” present. No punches thrown, but we wrestled a bit before I pinned him to the locker room floor. He gave up and no blood was shed. You could say that wrestling had some promise for me in the future. I was in fact accepted into that group of boys, so I had my cake (lunch) and ate it too!\n\nAll things considered, I found the year at Willetts Road School a new world. I had broken with my friends from St. Aidan’s and found new ones who became lifelong friends. All the while, a scant few miles north, ground had been broken on Bacon Road, the future site of an adventure, a bold experiment, the Wheatley School, that few if any Wheatley alums will ever forget.\n\n1960 – Diane Cohen-Alpert - Deceased\n\nhttp://www.janusyouth.org/news/post/in-memory-of-insights-founder-diane-cohen-alpert\n\n1960 – Dennis J. Harrelson – Deceased\n\n“Dennis J. Harrelson, 69, born December 21, 1940 in Flushing, NY died unexpectedly June 22, 2010. Dennis was raised on Long Island, NY, enjoying hotdogs at Jones Beach, old Westerns, and Mets baseball. Dennis joined the U.S. Army in 1962. This was followed by years in the finance world and Chase Bank in Manhattan. Knowing early he was ‘born to retire,’ Dennis did, and focused on being a devoted, dutiful son and companion to his beloved mother, Eleanor. After relocating to Tucson with her in 1997, Dennis attended services regularly at St. Frances de Sales Church. Tucson life allowed Dennis to indulge his love of golf, shopping at Costco and time with his extended family. Dennis was preceded in death by his mother, Eleanor; and brother, Stan. He is survived by his extended family of nieces, nephews, grand and great-grand nieces and nephews, as well as friends and neighbors who loved him very much. We will all miss Dennis' laid-back attitude, his fashionable golf hats, and his ever-present ‘care package’ offerings of salami, peppers and provolone. Even more, we will miss the time and love he shared with us.”\n\nWrites Robert Wechter, Wheatley Class of 1975 – “The Harrelsons lived directly across the street from my family on Amherst Road, in Albertson, in a nondescript white Levitt house. Dennis and his brother were older than my sisters and me. Growing up I used to see Mrs. Harrelson, Eleanor, outside in front of her house every morning, in her bathrobe, sweeping or tidying up the garden, even in the winter. I would see Dennis a lot, since he lived with his mother her entire life (she died on her 100th birthday; he died shortly thereafter). Occasionally I would see the older brother, Stanley, who worked in NY, but lived in Maryland and commuted on weekends.\n\nBeing a former journalist, and one with an insatiable curiosity, I always wondered what happened to Mrs. Harrelson and Dennis. During the latter stage of my parent's life, after I relocated them from Nevada to the D.C. metropolitan area, we were discussing former neighbors one day. So I did a little research and that's when I discovered obituaries for Eleanor and Dennis.\n\nI also remember coming home from school one day and seeing a complete set of kitchen cabinets sitting out on the Harrelson's front lawn. Apparently her sons wanted to install a complete brand new kitchen for her, as a surprise gift when she was away on summer holiday. They had sought my father's advice, as he was in the kitchen business. He advised them to abort their plans, absent Mrs. Harrelson's participation from start to finish in the process. He warned the sons that if they went ahead with their surprise, she would most likely have the brand new kitchen torn out and trashed. My dad also said that he would not do the kitchen, since he knew their mother well and was sure what her reaction would be. Well, sure enough, she returned from vacation and promptly had the expensive surprise kitchen torn out and trashed. This was an unusual experience on a quiet street where nothing of note ever really happened. Dennis Harrelson was a good guy and a considerate and thoughtful neighbor.”\n\n1960 – Four Gals in Del Ray Beach\n\nWrites Elaine Kent Abrams – “A few Wheatley gals having lunch in Delray Beach, FL. From left to right, Maddy Ardell Bloom, Elaine Kent Abrams, Renee Gershen Nadel and Jane Brody Baker. We had a lot of laughs and enjoyed reminiscing about 3rd grade through high school. How fast the years fly by. Elaine”\n\n1960 – Mini-Reunion at the Home of Ken & Cheryle Martin\n\nFrom left to right: Norm Coffey, Eileen Murphy, Lucy Mullman, George Howell, Cheryle Martin, Pete Koole, Linda Beattie Koole, Nancy Moncure, Ken Martin. In total, 18 people attended.\n\nWrites Ken – “The warm glow from that wonderful weekend remains with Cheryle and me. What an outstanding event?! A number of you have commented that it might have been our best one yet, and I concur. And from my perch, that’s not because of the venue, but due to the very warm relationships we have rekindled in attending these mini-reunions with the knowledge that time keeps marching on. We looked that evil and pernicious hour-glass right in the eye, stared it down, and won again. For now.\n\nOur class is not necessarily the best to come out of The Wheatley School, but we are most certainly different and, I believe, special. And to me one of the best benefits coming from the mini reunions is how the spouses of our graduates have melded into our group. Cheryle, Pete, Becky, Mary Ellen, Pat, Nancy and others are now an important component of our merry band of brothers and sisters, and I look forward to seeing and visiting with them as much as I do our classmates. I know Cheryle looks forward to the minis perhaps more than I do.”\n\n1961 – Patricia Kirk Hefferan – Looking Back\n\nWrites Patty – “There have been a number of comments from Wheatley students of the past who either disliked the school or felt they had not taken advantage of what the school had to offer. I am one of those people. I will always regret missing out on a unique education and lots of fun. I wore black on Red and White Day.\n\nSome of us are late bloomers. I went on to earn an ADN, a bachelor's, and a master's degree. I will, however, always regret that part of me that could not seem to fit into the Wheatley School and what it had to offer. The newsletter keeps me in touch, Thanks to Arthur and Keith.”\n\n1962 – Philip Christensen – Letter to Principal Wathey\n\n“Dear Mr. Wathey, I was delighted when I found out that I could write to you. I don’t recall ever meeting with you (probably a good thing), but my last two decades in college administration reminded me of why so many of your former students revere you as the ‘Legendary Mr. Wathey.’\n\nI recall so many excellent Wheatley teachers. Elsie Bodnar, 12th grade English, undoubtedly influenced my later decision to pursue a PhD in English Literature. I was conflicted in those days as a budding liberal in a ‘Rockefeller’ Republican family (that is, socially liberal and fiscally conservative), but I joined a student group that invited Norman Thomas to campus. I will never forget that day. In my senior yearbook, Laurence Levin wrote, ‘To the only Conservative Socialist I know.’ For geometry, I had Joe McCormack, who advised me correctly to stay with my first answers. I changed over half in the last two hours, but he was delighted to tell me I scored 100%. My homeroom and physical education teacher was Irwin August, who instilled the value of fitness in an awkward teenager, and I achieved one of the highest scores on the John F. Kennedy physical fitness test.\n\nMy school social life was centered in music, where I played in the concert/marching band for Bob Pearson and the orchestra for Sal Signorelli. Especially memorable was a concert that combined the Herricks High strings with the Wheatley strings and wind instruments. It was my first experience playing in a symphony orchestra, but not the last. Several years after graduating from college, I was appointed trumpeter for the Great Neck Symphony, and I was delighted to discover that Sal was a member of the string section.\n\nArt has done an excellent job recruiting many of us who spent far too long on the sidelines. What I’ve discovered is that high school students are often unhappy in high school, but our Wheatley unhappiness had nothing to do with The Wheatley School (I was taught well and still remember to use the definite article in the school name!). Like many of my classmates, I wish I could go back and become the high school student I think I never was back in the early 1960s. Thank you for putting up with so many ‘gifted and talented’ adolescents who often missed the landscape for the weedy clutter in our brains.\n\nI’m glad it isn’t too late to get acquainted, or to say thank you!”\n\n1962 – Willets Road Photographs\n\nWrites Richard Weiss – “These photos are of the Wheatley School Class of 1962 from Miss Stevenson‘s third grade class (top photo) and Mr. Fihn‘s fourth grade class (bottom photo). They are compliments of Madeleine Wild, who is a neighbor of mine now that I moved to Sonoma California. Fortunately, she and I look exactly the same as we did then.”\n\nOh, and here’s proof:\n\n“Madeleine and me in Sonoma, meeting for lunch last May.”\n\n1963 – Steven Rushmore – Times Have Changed\n\nWrites Steve – “I am the son of Carly Rushmore, who was on the East Williston School Board when Wheatley was built and was its first female President. She was good friends with Walter W. Wathey. One of the School Board stories my mother told me while I was growing up was a meeting she attended of all the New York State school board Presidents that was being held at the Harvard Club in NYC. At that time Harvard was all-male, and the club had strict rules limiting access to females. When my mother arrived at the club for the meeting she was denied access. However, after some negotiations she was ushered in via the service entrance and took a service elevator to the meeting rooms, where she joined her male counterparts. Times have certainly changed. Incidentally, I am presently a member of the Harvard Club.\n\nIn spite of the fact that my mother was very active on the EWSD Board, I went to boarding school at Proctor Academy in Andover, NH for my Junior and Senior years. I got lost in the highly competitive environment at Wheatley, and my parents thought a smaller school would be better for me. It turned out to be the right strategy - I got into Cornell (hotel school), which led me to create the largest hotel consulting firm in the world, HVS, with 50+ offices all over the globe. We specialize in appraising hotels. I have written all the books (8) on this topic, as well as 400 articles. I have testified in court over 80 times and have given hundreds of depositions. I was the appraiser on the landmark Saddlebrook case in NJ tax court that sets forth the proper procedure for valuing hotels for property tax appeals.\n\nA bit of Rushmore history in Roslyn. The property which is now the Roslyn Country Club area was my grandfather’s 100-acre farm, which he sold to Levitt in 1948. I was born in a large 28 room farm house that was at the southeast corner of Roslyn Road and the Northern State Parkway. More information can be found at\n\nhttps://www.hofstra.edu/pdf/library/libspc_lisi_rushmore_fa.pdf\n\nThe substitute teacher Mrs. Rushmore was a relative of mine – like a second cousin?? I had her a few times and she was a tough cookie.”\n\n1964 – Elvira (“Vivi”) Cilmi Kunz – “Wonderful Wheatley”\n\nWrites Vivi – “I always treasured my years at Wheatley. There were so many years of enjoying friendships that come to mind. Mostly, I remember my time in the music department, with Dr. Wills and Mr. Margolf giving lessons on life and ways to enjoy them. My time in the gym with Ms. Erickson and Ms. Wilson bring happy, fulfilling memories. In the academic world, Peter Witt was always there to listen and give sound advice. So many teachers gave us skills to succeed and an appreciation for learning! I still incorporate the ELA directives from junior year English as I prepare my students for State Tests!\n\nThe friends that surrounded these experiences made every day a day to look forward to with great positive energy. I am sure that my time at Wheatley greatly colored my eagerness to enter the world of education. I am presently still employed as an elementary level educator in a school that has become a second family over 45 years. Wheatley people helped me to become a lover of learning in every aspect possible. I have enjoyed teaching students that learning is essential to life and that where I learned that still brings a smile to my face!\n\nI have been happily married for almost 52 years. My amazing husband, Tim, carries the joy of learning in his heart as well. We have three children and eight grandchildren, who now teach us more about life every day! We both are very active in our church and community, and we appreciate all the diversity our life experience thrusts at us. Wheatley taught me that, too!\n\nSo thank you, dear friends, who still remain in my heart and mind. Wheatley is remembered fondly because of you. Seeing many of you at reunions always refreshes the joy of being a Wheatley Wildcat! I wish you all joy and peace. Vivi Cilmi Kunz, Class of 1964”\n\n1964 – Susan Obrant – Original, Creative, One-of-a-Kind\n\n“Artist Susan Obrant in her Cortland Manor Studio, not only surrounded by her own work, but wearing fashions of her own making.”\n\n“Susan is known for her own-of-a-kind crocheted wearable art.”\n\n“Fashion, accessory and costume designer; painter; illustrator; museum exhibitor… Susan Obrant basically embodies the word ‘creativity.’\n\nStepping into her Cortlandt Manor home, an eclectic, expansive space on the former grounds of a fabled hotel and spa, one quickly realizes these are also surroundings like no other.\n\nDressed in fashions of both her own design and making, Obrant offers first a warm welcome and then a tour, which seems quite natural.\n\nAfter all, her home is where she meets potential – and many repeat – clients by appointment. But it’s also home to her studio, an airy space that anchors the three floors that serve as both informal art galleries and, taken together, a de facto career retrospective.\n\nThere is not an inch of unadorned space – and that’s not a complaint. A walk through her home is a walk through her history, each painting, drawing, shawl or dress telling a story.\n\nTogether, it might trigger a remembrance of “A Serious Art Discussion,” Obrant says in reference to her two-year installation at Hudson Valley MOCA in Peekskill, in which mannequins wearing Obrant’s crochet designs studied her paintings on the wall.\n\nSuch an integrated display is clever and unexpected and totally works, drawing one completely into Obrant’s life in art.\n\nBorn in Philadelphia and growing up in its suburbs – though she’s been “in Westchester forever” – she would start out as a psychology major but transferred to Parsons School of Design “based on a summer’s worth of (art) classes.” In her 20s, Obrant worked as an illustrator, one whose work would go on to include a nomination for the 1971 Grammy Award for Best Album Cover for “The Music of Erik Satie: Through A Looking Glass.”\n\nHer art would come to encompass countless other media, from magazine illustrations to designing T-shirts for the Metropolitan Opera to paintings, including portraits by commission. Her paintings are continually inspired by family, travel, history, music and even sobering subjects such as the terrorist attacks of 9/11.\n\nLocal scenes are no exception, such as a work devoted to the Croton Dam: “I knew it was done when I could hear the roar of the water.” Movement and depth are key to her fine art. “I like the idea of a video camera, for a painting to do what a still camera cannot.” That sense of movement, of vibrancy, is found in her fashion and costume work, which is noted for its daring use of colors and textures.\n\nObrant pauses as we walk through her home to show off a particular purse: “This is the bag that began my business.” She was asked about its origin – and then asked to start making them. From then on, it’s been a whirlwind of dresses and vests, shawls and bags, hats and gloves, all one-of-a-kind yet clearly of her signature approach. “Performers love them because there are no seams. It’s like wearing air,” she says.\n\nShe knows what works from experience. “I trained as a dancer, which is why I dress dancers. Everything has to move.”\n\nObrant has dressed Audra McDonald and her dancers for the musical movie “Hello Again,” creates performance wear for classical-rock violinist Daisy Jopling, and has worked with numerous dance companies. She credits her grandmother for teaching her “one stitch” when Obrant was 8 that was the seed for her work in yarn, which she calls “couture crochet.”\n\n“I have no fashion training,” she says, before adding with a laugh, “I couldn’t follow a pattern to save my life.” Thought fashionable, her work is hardly created with trends in mind. “They’ll never be out of style. They’ll never be in style. They just are.” And they are for anyone, young or old, male or female. “There’s no appropriate age or style,” Obrant says. “If you put it on and you feel good,” as she says, then it’s for you.\n\nWhile Obrant sees many clients one-on-one, she enjoys showcasing her designs in shows, as well. A favorite is Crafts at Lyndhurst, which gathers some 300 of the nation’s leading contemporary craftspeople, artists and makers twice a year to the grounds of the historic mansion in Tarrytown. Laura Kandel, director of Artrider Productions, which is the longtime producer of the show, shares that Obrant has been participating in Artrider events since 2007. “Susan has found a way to take the very traditional and often undervalued craft of crocheting and make it modern, hip and wearable by women and men of all ages,” Kandel says, also recognizing her work in fine art. And, Kandel adds, Artrider shows are designed to offer the unexpected. “We are able to blow our customers’ minds because of artists like Susan who take traditional media and turn them on their head.” Obrant would appreciate those words, since her life in the arts has been all about creating her own path. And, she tells us, “The main thing is to trust yourself as an artist.”\n\nSusan Obrant is scheduled to exhibit at Fall Crafts at Lyndhurst Sept. 13-15 in Tarrytown.

Currently, I am working at the University of Iowa as a Clinical Assistant Professor in the Department of Anesthesia.

The Prestis see a strong children’s hospital that endures well into the future as an essential aspect for all citizens of the state. We are so grateful for their generosity. At The Children’s Hospital, our highest priority is to provide quality patient and family-centered care and to improve the lives of children throughout the region. The Presti family’s gift helps us make every patient and family’s hospital stay as comfortable as possible, thereby improving their recovery and healing process.”\n\nhttps://kfor.com/2019/06/13/oklahoma-city-thunder-general-manager-sam-presti-wife-donate-600k-to-the-childrens-hospital/\n\nWrites Rhoda – “Sam has done an amazing amount of charity and community work.

Featuring Sir Lucas of the Round Table(t). Astonishingly autobiographical. Remarkably personal. Profoundly irresponsible.”\n\n\"The Holden Caulfield of the hippie generation.\"\n\n\"Strasser perfectly captures the golden haze of youth and life on the cusp of adulthood. Readers fascinated with this time period will find much to enjoy... Vietnam, Woodstock, road trips, and acid trips: a sweetly bittersweet, surprising, even melancholy bildungsroman set against a world in flux. Groovy, man.\" -- KIRKUS\n\n\"Drugs, sex, and rock 'n' roll… are all here, but there's so much more… the story captures the mood and spirit of the times… the Woodstock music festival shows the dark side of peace and love…The best part… transcends eras: Lucas' introspection as he contemplates his place in the world.\" -- BOOKLIST\n\n“Summer of '69 rings absolutely true to the Vietnam era in ways most people have forgotten. It was an absolute delight to revel in Strasser's sparklingly dark prose, with its elegant turns of phrase and inventive combinations of words.” – BOOK CENTRAL\n\nWrites Todd - Dear Arthur, I want to let you know that I'll be speaking about my new novel, Summer of '69, on August 7th at 7 PM at the North Shore Historical Society Museum, 140 Glen Street in Glen Cove.

Rosenthal also was a founding director of Wesleyan’s Center for Community Partnerships and Service-Learning Center.\n\n“Rob has long been an extraordinary Wesleyan citizen, whose loyalty to Wesleyan is evident to all who know him,” wrote Wesleyan President Michael Roth in a campus-wide email. “He is much respected for his work as an administrator, chair of the faculty, and celebrated teacher-scholar.”\n\nNow, for a period of time as interim provost, Rosenthal again assumes the responsibility for matters relating to the faculty, the curriculum, continuing studies, athletics, and the library.\n\nRosenthal joined the Department of Sociology at Wesleyan in 1987, writing and teaching in the areas of housing and homelessness, community-based learning, and the use of music in social movements.

When he asked where I went, I replied, \"Wheatley,\" and he'd of course heard the name. And then the next thing he asked was, ‘Is that a private school’? And then I remembered how many times I've been asked that question over the years. Do all/any of you get that question, too?”\n\n1970 – George Nierenberg – Gospel Music Documentary\n\nWrites George – “My film Say Amen, Somebody will be opening at Lincoln Center on September 6th and playing there for three weeks before it is released in theaters nationally.\n\nSay Amen, Somebody\n\nGeorge T. Nierenberg, USA, 1982, 101m\n\n“One of the most acclaimed music documentaries of all time, Say Amen, Somebody is George T. Nierenberg’s exuberant, funny, and deeply moving celebration of 20th-century American gospel music. With unrivaled access to the movement’s luminaries, Thomas Dorsey and Mother Willie Mae Ford Smith, Nierenberg masterfully records their fascinating stories alongside earth-shaking, show-stopping performances by the Barrett Sisters, the O’Neal Twins, and others. As much a fascinating time capsule as it is a peerless concert movie, Say Amen, Somebody returns to Film at Lincoln Center in a gorgeous 4K restoration by Milestone Films, with support from the National Museum of African American History and Culture. An NYFF20 selection. A Milestone Films release.”\n\nhttps://sayamensomebodycom.wordpress.com/upcoming-screenings/\n\n1973 – Denise Paine Radow - Serendipity Strikes in Eugene, OR\n\nDenise Paine Radow, 1973 (L), and Judy Goldstein, 1964 (R)\n\nWrites Denise – “Surprisingly, I met another Wheatley graduate at a garage sale this beautiful morning in Eugene, OR.

See the photographic evidence!”\n\n1974 – Linda Jordan – Loss of a Spouse\n\nLinda’s husband, Tom Campiglia, passed away on June 8, 2019, after a long battle with glioblastoma.”\n\n1975 – Keith Rohman – An Unusual Path\n\nWrites Keith – “I am not the sort who would write into an alumni publication, but I have been drawn in by your newsletter, which has covered everything from the social/religious history of The Willets Road School to a poignant exchange between a Wheatly Vietnam Veteran and his social studies teacher.\n\nI graduated from Wheatley in 1975 and took an unusual path, which led to a fascinating but fulfilling career. Here is my story, for what it is worth.\n\nI dropped out of Vassar in my sophomore year to work as a community and union organizer in poor communities in Memphis, Philly and Detroit. Those places were where I learned the critical skills of how to listen and talk to people from many backgrounds.\n\nI did that into my early 20’s, when I moved to Los Angeles with my then-girlfriend (now wife) and began working as a private investigator. I found that my listening skills were useful in many different areas.\n\nMy firm, Public Interest Investigations, Inc., has been here in LA for 35 years; we have a staff of ten investigators. It is not like what you see on TV; we work for lawyers, governmental agencies, colleges, and corporations, with a focus on civil rights, sexual harassment and discrimination. We have been involved in some notable cases over the years, including the Rodney King case, the Abu Ghraib torture case, and over 40 death penalty murder cases, working for defense lawyers. We have also worked on investigations of mayors, police chiefs, and corporate executives. I am never bored at work and am not thinking about retirement.\n\nLike others, I have had joys and sorrows. I have been married for 35 years to Connie, a wonderful Canadian woman who became an artist in her 30’s. We had two great kids. Tragically, our son Jack took his own life nine years ago at the age of 21. He was a brilliant, creative person with many friends, but he suffered from schizophrenia and our best efforts to treat him did not succeed. His death changed our lives forever, but my wife, my daughter, and I have survived, with the help of good friends and good therapists.\n\nFor the last six years, I have had the joy of having my daughter, Nora, working for me as an investigator on our capital defense cases and our sexual harassment and campus sexual assault cases. She will surpass me in skills someday soon.\n\nI still have Wheatley connections. Patrick Burke (’76) and I became friends when we were 11 or 12 years old, and we have shared a lifetime of joys and sorrows. Pat, Ed Han (’76) and Steve Solow (’76) were my crew at Wheatley, and I am glad to still be good friends with each of them. Re: teachers - I remember “Bullet” Bob Bernstein and Merle Sy Levine with particular fondness.\n\nThe photograph above is a recent picture of me and Nora at Dodger Stadium, one of my happy places.”\n\n1975 – Daniel Weiss – Dan Takes a Stand\n\nhttps://www.nytimes.com/2019/05/15/arts/design/met-museum-sackler-opioids.html\n\n1976 – Yearbook Wanted\n\nIf anyone is interested in selling (donating?) a 1976 Aurora, I know someone (not me) interested in buying one.\n\n1978 – Bradley Feuer – Law and Medicine\n\nWrites Brad – “June 30 was my last day as a Director of Medical Education/Designated Institutional Official for HCA Healthcare, after 28 years in the role; 33 total working for the company. I started with an internship after medical school, and I continued with contract work in quality assurance through law school. I then became a member of the senior management team, with responsibilities including physician recruitment and retention, quality assurance, and graduate medical education (GME). I chaired a market-wide medical ethics committee, and I served as an additional risk manager and medical director of employee health at multiple facilities. I grew a single-facility internship program into a four-hospital, seven-program academic institution affiliated with multiple medical schools. I provided nationwide consultation on developing community-based GME programs, and I held two \"fly-ins\" for leadership. I represented HCA as a member of the Department of Homeland Security Active Shooter Situational Working Group and as a participant/subject matter expert in the United States Department of Health and Human Services/Assistant Secretary for Preparedness and Response Workshop on Critical Infrastructure. In 2002, I was awarded the Frist Humanitarian Award. Along with more than 20 CEOs, great program directors/administrative staff, and a mission dedicated to the quality of our graduates and care rendered to their future patients, our residencies have maintained 100% first-time board pass rates. It was my honor and privilege to have played such a role in the training of the next generation of physicians. Going forward I will focus on my volunteer role as Chief Surgeon and Medical Director of the Florida Highway Patrol, as well as consulting in healthcare law and the cruise industry (in which I have served as owners’ representatives in new-build ship design, provided confidential quality audits to cruise line senior management, and have sailed on nearly 200 cruises).”\n\n1979 – Class Reunion This Fall\n\nThe Class of 1979 is holding a 40th-year reunion near Wheatley during a Saturday evening in early October of this year.

I wish they were not so far distant, but knowing that I was not the only oddball kook is remarkably energizing and forgiving. The newsletters are good, Arthur. They really are.
