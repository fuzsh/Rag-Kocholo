        "text": "One could say that every artistic genre has its occasional masterpieces, even the more improbable genres. Like carefully conservative new operas in period settings, tunelessly modernist to retain the composer's ''serious'' credentials yet seemingly designed to appeal to timid middle-class audiences unwilling to accept the harder stuff. But even if cravenly hedged by these qualifications, Mark Adamo's ''Little Women'' is some sort of masterpiece.\n\nRight up there with Tobias Picker's ''Emmeline,'' another new work that has managed to extend the tired American folk opera idiom into a subtler contemporary climate. ''Little Women'' received its heartily cheered first New York performance on Sunday afternoon by the New York City Opera, which also gave us ''Emmeline.''\n\nModest expectations are always the best setup for unexpected pleasure. This is an opera that has been around for a good while, having had a workshop at the Houston Grand Opera in 1998. It was first performed there in its full form in 2000, has been recorded and nationally televised, has received 13 productions by 20 companies, including Glimmerglass last summer on its way to the State Theater. Some people I know liked it; others found it calculating and emotionally manipulative. Yet I had managed to insulate myself from it, so what I heard on Sunday surprised and pleased me all the more.\n\nMr. Adamo, who is now composer in residence at the City Opera and is working on a new opera to be performed by that company, has explained the curious genesis of his ''Little Women.'' First came an offer to adapt Louisa May Alcott's beloved if structurally diffuse novel of a family of four sisters in Concord, Mass., around the time of the Civil War. Then doubts, followed by his discovery of how he could adapt the material for operatic purposes. This process of discovery involved several increasingly detailed synopses, including notes as to what kind of music was needed for each scene. Then, after the production had shifted to Houston, came the writing of the libretto and finally the composing of the music itself. It sounded like a recipe for just the sort of dry calculation that has sunk so many outwardly similar modern operas.\n\nAnd yet: let us start with Mr. Adamo's libretto, built in rhymed couplets of seemingly effortless naturalness. Mr. Adamo's way into the novel was to see the opera as the story of the dominant sister Jo's gradual coming to terms with change: her sometimes painful (to herself and others) realization that the sweet bubble of family happiness, of childhood, of pre-Civil War American innocence, had to burst. But that change could mean life, not death.\n\nThe libretto proceeds with amazing sureness for a first opera. We come to love the complexity of Jo's character but can still be appalled by her selfish cruelty. Her sisters are all limned surely, as are the three men who come as agents of inevitable change.\n\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.
