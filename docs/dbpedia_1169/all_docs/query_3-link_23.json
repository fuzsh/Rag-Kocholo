Her career is marked by tireless advocacy in support of historically marginalized communities and progressive causes. Born in El Paso, Texas, Lee’s upbringing was deeply influenced by the civil rights movement, igniting her passion for activism and equality.\n\nIn 1998, Lee made history by becoming the first African American woman to represent Northern California in the U.S. Congress, a position she has held with distinction ever since. From her seat in the House of Representatives, Lee has championed causes that reflect her deep-rooted commitment to social justice, including education, housing, health care, the environment, and HIV/AIDS.\n\nIn 2023, Congresswoman Lee reintroduced bipartisan legislation called the Improving Access to Mental Health Act. Important to social workers nationwide, this legislation amends the Social Security Act to improve Medicare beneficiaries’ access to health and mental health services provided by clinical social workers (CSWs).\n\nCongresswoman Lee led the introduction of the Social Work Month Resolution over the last several Congresses. She joined Representative Gwen Moore to introduce a resolution that designated March 3-9, 2024, as School Social Work Week. Lee said: \"As a former psychiatric social worker and chair of the Congressional Social Work Caucus, I am proud to recognize ‘School Social Workers Week’ alongside my colleague Congresswoman Gwen Moore. School social workers are critical mental health professionals who serve as bridges between vulnerable students and the resources they need to thrive as adults. Congress must use every possible avenue to uplift and empower school social workers and the students they serve.”\n\nIn 1975, she began her public service as a staffer for Congressman Ron Dellums, where she honed her skills as a grassroots organizer and advocate. Inspired by Dellums’ unwavering commitment to progressive values, Lee continued to rise through the ranks, serving as his Chief of Staff until 1998.\n\nCurrently, Congresswoman Lee serves on the Budget Committee and the powerful Appropriations Committee, which oversees all federal government spending. In January 2021, she became the first African American to chair the House Appropriations Subcommittee on State, Foreign Operations, and Related Programs.\n\nCongresswoman Lee is the highest ranking African American woman appointed to Democratic Leadership, serving as Co-Chair of the Policy and Steering Committee. She is the chair of the Congressional Social Work Caucus, former chair of the Congressional Black Caucus (111th Congress) and Chair Emeritus of the Congressional Progressive Caucus (109th & 110th Congresses).\n\nThrough these caucuses, Lee has been a powerful voice, providing support for vulnerable populations in California and around the country. And the Congresswoman’s dedication to social justice extends beyond the halls of Congress: she is a vocal advocate for criminal justice reform, LGBTQ+ rights, reproductive justice, economic equality.\n\nAmong her many awards, Congresswoman Lee has been honored as an NASW Social Work Pioneer®, inspiring new generations of social welfare advocates and progressive policymakers. Congresswoman Lee received a BA in Psychology from Mills College and a MSW from the University of California, Berkeley.\n\nCongratulations, Congresswoman Lee, for your commitment to social justice.\n\nNASW Foundation International Rhoda G. Sarnat Award\n\nPedro Navarro Aguilar, MSW\n\nPedro Navarro Aguilar, MSW, is a social worker who, while navigating his life as a blind, undocumented immigrant, has made significant contributions toward conveying a positive image of social work.\n\nThe documentary film “unseen” starts in 2016, from the time Pedro was a student to his current life as a professional social worker. In the film, we see how he: provides mental health care to survivors of one of the deadliest mass shootings in the U.S.; facilitates trainings for adults experiencing vision loss so they can develop skills like using a walking cane or reading Braille; hosts workshops in Spanish to further develop the skill sets of mental health professionals; offers mental health services to underserved communities (namely, immigrant and blind people) using culturally sensitive and in-language methodology; and demonstrates vulnerability on a personal level to further enhance his own mental health practice and ability to relate to his clients.\n\nIn the documentary, Pedro demonstrates to audiences the emotional intelligence and tremendous skill it takes to practice as a professional social worker. A field that seems so unfamiliar to many gains more relevancy as Pedro models how his lived experience informs the work he does by embodying the very tenets of social work.\n\nA testament to Pedro’s compelling expertise in the profession, the film has been supported by NBCUniversal, Sundance Institute, Open Society Foundations, Ford Foundation, Gotham Film and Media Institute, Field of Vision, Firelight Media, among others. It has been screened in 25 film festivals on three continents. Pedro’s work has moved audiences globally, as attested by these select accolades and reviews:\n\nIndependent Spirit Awards, Truer than Fiction Award: Film Independent\n\nVijay Mohan Social Impact Award: Philadelphia Asian American Film Festival\n\nBest Feature, Shortlist: International Documentary Association (IDA) Awards\n\nHot Docs Canadian International Documentary Festival, Official Selection\n\nActive Vista International Human Rights Festival (Philippines), Official Selection\n\nUS Broadcast on award-winning PBS documentary series, POV / Press Release\n\nSample review: “What I find uplifting about Pedro as a person is the balance that he strikes between vulnerability and courage… A compelling portrait of a resilient individual pursuing a better life despite his situation, “unseen” aims to transcend socio-politics with its narrative and instead focus on the humanity of its subject.” - The Movie Buff\n\nTo learn more about Pedro’s journey, copy and paste PBS link: https://www.pbs.org/pov/films/unseen/\n\nTrailer (2 mins): https://vimeo.com/834915696/409add305c\n\nThe NASW Foundation congratulates you, Pedro.\n\nNASW Foundation Knee-Wittman Outstanding Achievement Award\n\nPeter Buxton, JD (1937-2024)\n\nPeter Buxtun was a former employee of the United States Public Health Service (USPHS) who became known as the whistleblower responsible for ending the Tuskegee syphilis experiment, also known as the “USPHS study of untreated syphilis in the negro male at Tuskegee Macon County, AL 1932-1972.” Buxtun’s life experiences led him to identify the study as morally indefensible and to seek justice for the male victims.\n\nAfter earning a European History BA at the University of Oregon, Buxtun served in the U.S. Army as a Psychiatric Social Worker. Later, as a 27-year-old epidemiologist in San Francisco, he was hired by the U.S. Public Health Service (USPHS) in December 1965 as a venereal disease (VD) investigator to interview patients with sexually transmitted diseases (STDs). In the course of his duties, he learned about the Tuskegee experiment from co-workers.\n\nIn November 1966, he filed an official protest on ethical grounds with the USPHS Division of Venereal Diseases. The men were vulnerable populations of poor farmers who were deceived about the offerings of free medical care and other benefits for their participation. Buxtun’s protest was rejected on the grounds that the experiment was not yet complete. He filed another protest in November 1968, seven months after the assassination of Martin Luther King Jr., pointing out the political volatility of the study. Again, his concerns were ruled irrelevant.\n\nIn 1972, Buxtun leaked information on the Tuskegee experiment to Jean Heller of the Associated Press. It first appeared in the Washington Star. Heller's story exposing the experiment was published on July 25, 1972. Senator Edward Kennedy called Congressional hearings, at which Buxtun and officials from the U.S. Department of Health, Education, and Welfare testified. The experiment was terminated shortly afterwards.\n\nIn May 1999, Buxtun attended the launch of a memorial center and public exhibit dedicated to the history of the Tuskegee Experiment. Buxtun’s charges led to new laws governing human research and governing medical ethics committees with non-physician members.\n\nIn 1997, U.S. President Bill Clinton apologized for the Tuskegee Experiment: “The United States government did something that was… profoundly, morally wrong… clearly racist.”\n\nThe Tuskegee men, their partners, and their children/descents still receive payments of restitution from the CDC today for its lifelong effects on the families. Buxtun's efforts led to the creation of the Belmont Report, which established new laws governing human research, as well as Medical Ethics Committees featuring non-physician members. These measures safeguard against unethical treatment of human subjects, families, groups, and communities. Many textbooks today in social work analyze his study and how it relates to research and healthcare social work practice.\n\nBuxtun came to America as an infant when his family fled the Nazi occupation of Czechoslovakia in 1939. Born in 1937 in Prague, Czechoslavakia, Buxtun was of Jewish and Czech descent. A self-described child of the Holocaust, he was born to a Jewish father and a Christian mother who took him to America in 1938. He grew up speaking German and was a German history and Nuremburg trials researcher. It was this expertise that led to Buxtun joining the CDC in 1965 as a VD investigator.\n\nNational Social Worker of the Year Award\n\nState Representative Lydia Crafts, LCSW (ME)\n\nRepresentative Lydia Crafts grew up in midcoast Maine as the daughter of a clinical social worker. She had the privilege of attending Smith College where she obtained a Bachelor of Arts degree and later, the University of Maine for her Master of Social Work degree.\n\nAfter living in the Pacific Northwest for several years, Representative Crafts returned to Maine and pursued a career in behavioral health. She has devoted the last decade of her professional life to special education, with a focus on treating children with dangerous behaviors. As a current legislator, her policy work focuses on strengthening Maine’s behavioral health infrastructure, increasing access to services, and promoting a strong workforce.\n\nRepresentative Crafts was recently honored by the NASW Maine Chapter for her comprehensive and sustained efforts to improve social conditions and advocate for social workers and their respected clients across Maine. She has exemplified the best in social work through her service and leadership as both an elected Representative for District 46 (Damariscotta/Newcastle) and as a licensed Maine social worker for the past eleven years. She has helped to sponsor and co-sponsor over 100 pieces of legislation during the 131st Legislative Session including: the Social Work Loan Repayment bill and legislation to support social work licensing, school-based behavioral health services, and practice conditions for social workers in the State of Maine.\n\nRepresentative Crafts has also co-sponsored a new bill to remove barriers for entry into the field of social work for BSW and MSW graduates. She has been referred to as “a guiding star, a champion for social work causes, a supreme collaborator, facilitator, and wise consultant.” She is a staunch advocate for her clients as well as her constituents and is well respected for her work as a clinical social worker. With social workers under attack across the country, Representative Crafts has stood firm in her commitment to the people of Maine. She is a champion for the underserved, oppressed, stigmatized, and historically marginalized. Her actions reflect the core social work values espoused in the NASW Code of Ethic; those of service, social justice, dignity and worth of the person, importance of human relationships, integrity, and competence. Her work as an elected official and as a clinical social worker have benefited so many. It is for these reasons and many more that we honor and celebrate Representative Lydia Crafts as the recipient of the NASW National Social Worker of the Year Award.\n\nNASW Foundation Knee-Wittman Lifetime Achievement\n\nThe Honorable Debbie Stabenow (D-MI)\n\n“Made in Michigan” through and through, U.S. Senator Debbie Stabenow continues to lead on public policy and improve the lives of the people of Michigan and Americans across our country. Her leadership is characterized by an unrivaled work ethic, the ability to build bipartisan coalitions to get things done, and a commitment to public service that has set the standard for constituent service.\n\nThroughout her years in public service, she has blazed trails and opened doors for women and girls. Among her many “firsts” – she was the first woman elected to the United States Senate from Michigan.\n\nSenator Stabenow is the leader in the United States Senate in the movement to improve access to mental health and substance abuse services. In 2014, her bipartisan Excellence in Mental Health and Addiction Treatment Act created a new, transformational system that funds community behavioral health services the same way we fund physical health services. This new approach is expanding community mental health services nationwide. It’s also reducing the stigma around mental illness and moving us closer to true parity between physical and mental health care.\n\nSenator Stabenow is also the leader in strengthening school-based health services including behavioral health. Senator Stabenow is a champion for behavioral health care providers as well. In the end of the year funding bill, she secured the inclusion of provisions to expand and strengthen the behavioral health workforce. With her bipartisan Improving Access to Mental Health Act, she has been leading the effort to increase Medicare’s reimbursement rate for clinical social workers and ensure they can provide their full range of services to Medicare beneficiaries.\n\nAs Chairwoman of the Senate Agriculture Committee, Senator Stabenow has been the leader for protecting and strengthening national food assistance programs and child nutrition initiatives, so that children have access to healthy meals at school. She is also the author of the new permanent summer meals program for children.\n\nAs a state representative in Michigan in the 1980s, Representative Stabenow chaired the Mental Health Committee. Among many laws enacted to improve the lives of Michiganders, she authored the Children’s Mental Health Act and the Family Support Subsidy Act to help families caring for severely disabled children at home.\n\nSenator Stabenow received her bachelor’s and master’s degrees in social work from Michigan State University. She is a proud member of the Congressional Social Work Caucus.\n\nNational Public Citizen of the Year Award\n\nCynthia Herrara, JD\n\nCynthia “Cy” Herrera, JD, serves as Executive Director of ASHwell, a holistic sexual health and wellness center based in Austin, Texas.
