Part of her job involved polishing brass museum plaques from the Metropolitan Museum of Art. She noted that one plaque attributed a painting to [Constance Marie] Charpentier, but the plaque also included her teacher, Jacques-Louis David in parenthesis because no one knew Charpentier’s name. Struck by the injustice of this, she was told no one knew Charpentier, implying that the painting had no value if it was painted by a woman.\nOther stories include her recollection of her suspension from Bard on grounds of ‘moral turpitude’ (though she was able to keep her scholarship, and was allowed to study for a time at The New School); and her memory of being welcomed into a Bard sisterhood of women who shared a red flannel coat, along with a communal diaphragm.\nHer subsequent career as teacher and artist was in part a response to the painful experiences she had in college, and as a talented woman in the 1950s. She felt the message she was given was “Do whatever you want. This is a free liberal time. But don’t expect it to mean anything.” And as she explained, “We didn’t have a context yet; we didn’t have feminist studies….breaking down the inherited patriarchy and its structures.”\nCarolee Schneemann died on March 6, 2019.",
