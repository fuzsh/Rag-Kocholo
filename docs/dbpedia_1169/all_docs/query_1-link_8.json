        "text": "Here is a selective listing by critics of The Times of new or noteworthy opera, classical music and dance events this weekend in the New York metropolitan region.\n\nOpera\n\nGLIMMERGLASS OPERA. All four of this enterprising company's productions are being staged this weekend. Monteverdi's ''Ritorno d'Ulisse in Patria,'' which is offered tonight, is given a gorgeous production with a real sense of mythic proportion, not to mention powerful performances by James Maddalena, Phyllis Pancella and a large supporting cast. Tomorrow, Rhoda Levine's characterful, probing production of ''Rigoletto,'' in which Mark Delavan gives a stunning performance in the title role, is to be presented in the afternoon, with Mozart's ''Abduction from the Seraglio'' in the evening, in a production by Irene Lewis with William Burden, Joyce Guyer, Timothy Swaim, Anna Christy and Gustav Andreassen in the principal roles. ''Central Park,'' to be seen on Sunday, is a trilogy of concise, powerful new operas by three accomplished young composers and three prominent playwrights, all set in different parts of Central Park: In ''The Festival of Sorrows,'' by Deborah Drattell and Wendy Wasserstein, an afternoon of introspection at a Jewish New Year's ritual at the Bethesda Fountain draws a divorced couple back together. In ''Strawberry Fields,'' by Michael Torke and A. J. Gurney, a compassionate student befriends a senile woman whose children are trying to institutionalize her. And in ''The Food of Love,'' by Robert Beaser and Terrance McNally, a homeless woman tries to give her newborn son to someone who will give him a good future. Tonight at 8 (''Il Ritorno d'Ulisse''); tomorrow at 1:30 P.M. (''Rigoletto''); tomorrow night at 8 (''Abduction from the Seraglio''), and Sunday at 2 P.M. (''Central Park''), Glimmerglass Opera, 7300 State Highway 80, Cooperstown, N.Y., (607) 547-2255. Tickets: $40 to $80 (Allan Kozinn).\n\nClassical Music\n\nASTON MAGNA. The early-music scene in the Northeast has long gravitated between New York and Boston, and what better middle ground is there in the summer than the Berkshire Hills? Here the festival closes its 27th season with a program of Bach, including the sixth ''Brandenburg'' Concerto, the Cantata No. 198 (''Trauerode'') and the Sonata in G for Two Flutes and Continuo. Daniel Stepner, a violinist and the artistic director, is joined by a variety of performers, with Jane Bryden, Jeffrey Gall, William Hite and David Ripley as vocalists. Tomorrow night at 6, St. James Church, off Main Street, Great Barrington, Mass., (413) 528-3595. Tickets: $20 at the door; $18.50 in advance; $16 for students and the elderly. The program will also be presented tonight at 8 at Bard College, Route 9G, Annandale-on-Hudson, N.Y., (914) 758-7425. Tickets: $15; $10 for students and the elderly (James R. Oestreich).\n\nBARGEMUSIC. Besides being an ideally intimate place for chamber music, the Bargemusic series keeps attracting a core of loyal and excellent performers, including this weekend. On Sunday the violinist Christiaan Bor, the violist Marcus Thompson, the cellist Ronald Thomas and the pianist Edward Auer are to perform. The program includes a Francaix String Trio, Brahms's rhapsodic Piano Quartet in C Minor and Chopin's seldom-heard Cello Sonata. Sunday at 4 P.M., Bargemusic, Fulton Ferry Landing, Brooklyn, (718) 624-2083 or (718) 624-4061. Tickets: $23; $20 for the elderly; $15 for students (Anthony Tommasini).\n\nBERKSHIRE CHORAL FESTIVAL. For listeners who love choral music, this festival is an ideal refuge, combining as it does the charms of the Berkshires and some of the highlights of the choral repertory, as performed by a 225-voice choir accompanied by the Springfield Symphony Orchestra. The centerpiece of the festival's final concert of the year is the Beethoven Ninth Symphony, certainly a fine way to close a summer of choral music. Also on the program are two American works: Randall Thompson's Alleluia and Howard Hanson's ''Lament for Beowulf.'' Mark Russell Smith is to conduct. Tomorrow night at 8, Berkshire School, 245 North Undermountain Road, Sheffield, Mass., (413) 229-1800. Tickets: $18 to $28 (Kozinn).\n\nCARAMOOR MUSIC FESTIVAL. Two recitals constitute the classical music offerings at Caramoor this weekend. Tonight the guitarist Paul Galbraith is to present a program of Bach, Costantinides, Skalkottas and Haydn. Mr. Galbraith plays an eight-string guitar of his own design that significantly increases the instrument's range and capabilities. With it, for example, Mr. Galbraith can play the Haydn Piano Sonata No. 45 that concludes this program. On Sunday afternoon the superb French pianist Jean-Yves Thibaudet will play a substantive program of Ravel and Debussy: Ravel's ''Valse Nobles et Sentimentales'' and ''Miroirs'' and Debussy's 12 Preludes, Book II and ''L'Isle Joyeuse.'' Mr. Thibaudet's recordings of these works on the London label are extraordinary. Tonight at 8 (Mr. Galbraith), the Spanish Courtyard. Tickets: $20. Sunday at 4:30 P.M. (Mr. Thibaudet), the Venetian Theater. Tickets: $25 and $35. Caramoor Music Festival, Girdle Ridge Road, Katonah, N.Y., (914) 232-1252 and (914) 232-5035 (for directions) (Tommasini).\n\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.
