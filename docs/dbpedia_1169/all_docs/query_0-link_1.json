        "text": "Objects come in all sorts of shapes, sizes and forms. The notion of musical works as objects, represented by their written scores, has proved to be effete and limiting to the study of music as diverse social-cultural practice and performed craft. The past two decades have witnessed considerable efforts to renew conceptual and methodological tools, and Neumann's study makes a valuable contribution to this effect. This commentary responds to some issues raised by Neumann's article in relation to the notion of musical \"object\". Specifically, I retrace the shift from a score-based to a process-oriented musicology geared towards performances, placing the concerns of contemporary opera studies within this broader disciplinary change. I consider some implications of technology in mediating new operatic objects for discourse. Finally, I reflect on some of the inherent dangers of objectifying performance in empirical analyses.\n\nPerformance analysis studies aid the re-creative process of reading the score and transmitting the ideas inherent in text and music via different tools of representation. In the case of vocal performance, the transitory elements of representation involve not only aural signs, such as linguistic signs, but also kinetic signs, comprising gesture, mime and movement on stage (Liebscher 1999: 56). The performance process of vocal works from the viewpoint of the performer undergoes initially a deconstruction process which involves decision-making aiming at the communication of particular ideas via specific signs through tone production, gesture, mime and body movement. Therefore, the simultaneous execution of auditory and visual signs, often a problem of coordination, requires a method of performance analysis which examines and connects the dramatic correlation and timing of the various elements of delivery. This paper uses the principles of the system of gesture, silent acting, and music analysis of word- and tone-based genres to provide successful strategies for such a performance analysis and facilitate a well coordinated vocal performance that will be true to the dramatic content.\n\nThe present paper forms part of a complex research project and is designed to be a chapter in the book based on a closed-reading approach I am conducting in opera semiotics and literary and philosophical anthropology with the aim to provide a series of interpretations of drama and opera of selected operas of Mozart and plays of Shakespeare, inviting Nietzsche and Kierkegaard as our guides. The thorough study of the subject invites comparisons which should lead to new insights into the musical drama, i.e. the way drama is conveyed by the musical form. To quote Osip Mandelstam, \"Music is no guest here called in from outside, but an active participant in the debate, or to put it more precisely, the one who promotes discourse”. The term I have coined as the \"phenomenology of music” refers to the methodology of outward or perceptible indications depicted (or the depictability of such indications) in form(ation)s and configurations related to and conditioned by the musical expression. The findings presented in this paper are intended to serve as a stepstone for close-reading based analyses of other operas. In the first part of this paper I offer a close-reading analysis of a scene from a Musorgsky opera leading us to identify a \"musical trope” – the musical metaphor – which I term as the \"musical synecdoche.” Musical tropology, likewise metaphor in language, becomes a key tool in approaching the musical work. One of the characteristic elements in the poetic arsenal of Gogol, a technique termed by Boris Eikhenbaum as the \"Gogolian mask,” reappears in Musorgsky's last opera, Khovanshchina, having a musical genre adapt a literary legacy. The second part of the paper approaches the subject in a more pragmatical way, insofar it examines an opera staging set, the Figure of the Child from Andrei Tarkovsky's production of Musorgsky's Boris Godunov, intending to draw attention to the importance of selecting the right tools in designing the visuality of an opera performance."
