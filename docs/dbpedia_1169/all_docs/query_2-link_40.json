        "text": "Opera\n\nIntroduction to Opera and a look at Susannah and Die Fledermaus\n\nOpera Basics\n\nWhat is an opera, anyway?\n\nOpera is drama told through music. It is a play in which the dialogue is sung rather than spoken. It is usually presented on a very grand scale, with large, imposing sets, elaborate and colorful costumes, and stylized stage direction. There is often a chorus-an ensemble of singers who make up the townspeople and other supplemental characters. Often dancing (e.g., ballet) is part of the spectacle as well.\n\nHow did opera start?\n\nThe history of opera as it is presented today in America goes back to the late Renaissance in Italy (1500-1600), when a group of composers “invented” it to resemble what they thought music-drama was like in classical Greece.\n\nOperas are usually sung in the language in which they were composed, which means that opera singers must be able to sing in Italian, German, French, and other languages, as well as in English. Most of today’s opera houses offer English supertitles.\n\nSee a detailed timeline on the development of American opera.\n\nWhat makes an opera different from a musical?\n\nThe biggest difference is the musical style. The singers who perform in a musical usually have mikes hidden in their wig or costume, while singers who perform in operas usually do not use microphones.\n\nA musical is a drama told by interweaving songs and music with spoken dialogue, while most operas are sung throughout with little or no spoken dialogue.\n\nVoice types in opera\n\nClassically trained singers learn to use their voices so that they can be heard over a full symphony. They do this by learning to strengthen their diaphragms so they can project a steady stream of air that helps create a big sound.\n\nFemale voices are divided into three categories:\n\nSoprano (highest)\n\nMezzo-Soprano (middle range)\n\nContralto (lowest)\n\nMale voices are divided into three categories:\n\nTenor (highest)\n\nBaritone (middle range)\n\nBass (lowest)\n\n↑ Top\n\nElements of a performance (Glossary)\n\nAlto\n\nThe lowest female voice. Sometimes this term is used interchangeably with Mezzo Soprano.\n\nAppogiatura\n\nA musical phrase with an ornamental note that is added to the beginning of a main note. The musical phrase is resolved to the main note.\n\nArpeggio\n\nA chord whose pitches are played in succession, usually from lowest to highest.\n\nBaritone\n\nThe middle range male voice.\n\nBass\n\nThe lowest range male voice.\n\nColoratura\n\nElaborate ornamentation or embellishment of a phrase, either written or improvised.\n\nDoloroso\n\nItalian for painful or sorrowful.\n\nFermata\n\nThe symbol within the musical score that signals that a note should be held longer than notated.\n\nFortissimo\n\nItalian for very loud.\n\nGiocoso\n\nItalian for humorous, comedic.\n\nHarmony\n\nThe relationships of tones as they sound simultaneously. The literal definition of harmony does not necessarily dictate a pleasing sound, as in the commonly used idea that harmony is a group of notes sounding good together.\n\nLento\n\nItalian for slow.\n\nLibretto\n\nThe text of a work (as an opera) for the musical theater\n\nMezzo-Soprano\n\nA middle range female voice.\n\nMolto Allegro\n\nItalian for very fast\n\nPiano\n\nItalian for quiet.\n\nQuartet\n\nA piece of music performed by four performers.\n\nScales\n\nA collection of pitches arranged in order of lowest to highest or highest to lowest.\n\nSoprano\n\nThe highest female voice.\n\nStaccato\n\nNotes marked by a dot, played or sung shorter, separate from the others around it, and with a light accent.\n\nTenor\n\nThe highest male voice.\n\nTrills\n\nRapid alteration of a note with the one next above in the prevailing key or harmony.\n\nTrio\n\nA piece of music performed by three performers.\n\n↑ Top\n\nFrom Script to Libretto; from Play to Opera-the Process of Adaptation\n\nUsed with permission from Washington Opera\n\nThe stories told by operas originate in a variety of places; they may be inspired by a historical figure or incident, be an original creation, or may be from a book or play. While it is not uncommon for a play to be made into an opera, it is rare for the script of a play to be set directly to music.\n\nInstead, the script of the play is adapted to become the opera’s libretto. One of the advantages to telling a story through song is that music can be used to convey the underlying mood of any conversation or situation that may take place. As a result, ideas and relationships that could take pages of text to establish in a play can be conveyed in just a few moments of song in an opera. For this reason, the librettos of operas are typically much shorter than the scripts from which they were adapted. In addition to reorganizing the script so that the story will be most effectively told through music, the language used by characters may also have to be altered in order to flow with the music. An example of this would be of rewriting dialogue into rhyming lyrics.\n\nIn Susannah, Carlisle Floyd has translated the apocryphal story of Susanna and the Elders. This parable is based on malice, hypocrisy and tragedy. A tale of unjust accusation and social ostracism, it carries echoes of the McCarthy era for some.\n\n↑ Top\n\nSusannah\n\nThe following sections includes a guide and description of Susannah\n\nAbout Susannah\n\nKentucky Opera’s Guide to Susannah\n\nNOTE: Susannah is an opera containing some mature themes.\n\nThe Electronic Field Trip to Kentucky Opera is appropriate for grades 6-9. This Web guide is intended primarily for teachers and is also appropriate for high school students.\n\nMusic and Libretto by Carlisle Floyd\n\nPremiere: Florida State University; Tallahassee, Florida; February 24, 1955\n\nTime: The Present\n\nPlace: New Hope Valley, Tennessee\n\nKentucky Opera’s production of Susannah is conducted by Ward Homquist, with stage direction by Rhoda Levine.\n\nACT 1\n\nIt is a summer night, and the people of New Hope Valley have gathered for a square dance. Susannah Polk, who is prettier than the other girls, is obviously the center of attention. The Elders are attracted to Susannah while their wives discuss the new preacher, Olin Blitch, whom they expect to arrive in the morning. The wives turn their attention to Susannah, and voice their disapproval of her pretty face, her dress, and her manner. The dancing comes to a stop when Blitch arrives. He immediately notices Susannah.\n\nLater that evening, Susannah returns to the Polk farmhouse, followed by simple-minded Little Bat. He adores Susannah, but he is afraid of her brother Sam. As Susannah sings of the beauty of the night, Sam returns home. Little Bat runs off at the sight of him, while Susannah tells Sam about the dance.\n\nThe following morning, as the four Elders search for an appropriate spot for a baptismal pool, they come upon Susannah bathing in the creek. They freeze in shock and outrage, and return to town, proclaiming her wrongdoing.\n\nThat evening, there is a picnic supper at the church. The entire town condemns Susannah’s actions at the creek, and they repeat the words of the Reverend Blitch, demanding a public confession. Susannah enters quietly and is stunned when no one will speak to her. The Elder McLean informs her that she is not welcome, and the confused girl runs blindly away.\n\nLater, Susannah is seated on the steps of her house. Little Bat enters, and he tells her what is wrong. The Elders have spread the word that they saw her bathing in the creek, and they intend to run her out of the church and maybe even the valley. Susannah gasps with indignation, stating that she has always bathed in the creek and resents being spied upon. Little Bat also reveals that the Elders induced him to confess that he had been involved with her. Susannah is angry at Little Bat for telling such a lie, but he says he was too scared to resist them, and she angrily sends him away. Susannah notices that Sam is on the porch and has heard the whole story. He tries to calm her. She begs him to explain why this is happening to her, but he can only answer with silence.\n\nACT 2\n\nA few days later, Susannah attends the New Hope Church prayer meeting, sitting alone on the last bench. The Reverend Blitch begins his sermon about a man who was good, but not “saved.” The choir sings, and above the voices, Blitch urges all sinners to come forward. After a number of people go up to him, he stops the choir with a wave. He speaks of the one sinner who has not approached him, and the congregation turns and stares at Susannah. Blitch concentrates his attention on her and she slowly moves forward, transfixed. As she comes to a stop before him, he smiles triumphantly. The spell breaks, and Susannah rushes from the church.\n\nAn hour later, at the Polk farm, Susannah sings a mountain lover’s lament. From behind her comes the voice of Blitch, complimenting her on her singing. He explains that he has come to talk about her soul. Susannah accuses the Elders and Little Bat of lying. Blitch is impressed, but as she continues to describe her loneliness and her misery of that week, he insists that the sin is in her heart. She denies this vehemently. He approaches her, and lays his hand on her shoulder, but she is too weary to react. Blitch then speaks of his own loneliness, and upon discovering that Sam is away, he leads her into the house.\n\nThe next morning at the church, Blitch prays, begging for forgiveness of his sin against God and Susannah. She enters, along with the Elders and their wives. Blitch has called them, he explains, to right a wrong. He proclaims Susannah’s innocence and asks them all to forgive her. The Elder McLean stubbornly demands to know why Blitch has had a change of heart. Blitch responds that the Lord spoke to him in prayer, but the Elders reject this. Blitch pleads with Susannah that he has tried to make amends, and asks for her forgiveness. She responds that she no longer knows what that word means.\n\nWhen Sam returns home, he learns of Blitch’s actions with his sister. Enraged, he kills the preacher at the baptismal pool. Susannah hears the shot and realizes what has happened even before Little Bat rushes in with the news. The people of the valley come after Susannah, but she greets them with a shotgun and derisive laughter, and drives them away. She is left a lonely, embittered woman.\n\nAbout Susannah at the U.S. Opera site\n\n↑ Top\n\nCharacters in Susannah\n\nCharacter Name Description, Voice Type, Artist’s Name\n\nMrs. Gleaton Elder Wife, Soprano, Teresa Dody\n\nMrs. Hayes Elder Wife, Soprano, Dana Beth Miller\n\nMrs. McLean Elder Wife, Mezzo-Soprano, Diana Heldman\n\nMrs. Ott Elder Wife, Mezzo-Soprano, Dorothy Byrn\n\nElder McLean Elder, Baritone, Steven Condy\n\nOlin Blitch Evangelist Preacher, Bass-Baritone, Mark Delavan\n\nElder Hayes Elder, Tenor, Gary Seydell\n\nElder Ott Elder, Baritone, Ryan Allen\n\nElder Gleason Elder, Tenor, Jared Fenske\n\nSusannah Polk Young Woman, Soprano, Jennifer Casey Cabot\n\nLittle Bat McLean Son of Elder and Mrs. McLean, Tenor, Jon Kolbet\n\nSam Polk Brother of Susannah, Tenor, Jay Hunter Morris\n\n↑ Top\n\nCharacteristics of Susannah\n\n“I’ve talked to many people who want to label Susannah a folk opera. I say, ‘That establishes the locale, but I hope that is only the beginning of it.'”\n\n– Carlisle Floyd\n\nSusannah is an American folk-type opera. It has often been characterized as homespun. It is about mountain valley intolerance. The opera depends greatly on word, action, and dramatic intensity with American dances and revival hymns. It skillfully imitates Appalachian square dances and folk songs. Susannah combines poetry and music in a way that brings seemingly unremarkable characters to life, showing the depth and passions of human emotions and the tragedy of human weaknesses, real and perceived.\n\nSusannah is so thoroughly Southern that she could not live anywhere but in her valley of New Hope, Tennessee. Though the emotions in Susannah are universal, most people who encounter the opera today probably find the action somewhat removed from their own everyday existence. Few operas match the story, diction, and music so perfectly.\n\nSources: “Intermission,” Ticket to the Opera pp. 575-576 (1996); Mitchell, “Susannah,” Opera pp. 33, 36 (1956); Opera News 1999 pp 23 – 23; Martin, “Susannah,” The Opera Companion to Twentieth Century Opera pp 558-564 (1970).\n\n↑ Top\n\nWho is Susannah?\n\nFrom Who’s Who in the Bible 1994\n\nAccording to the book of Susanna in the Apocrypha, Susanna and the prophet Daniel were among the Jewish exiles living in Babylon. Because Susanna rebuffed two elders with dishonorable intentions, they accused her of sinful behavior, and she was condemned to death. Upon being led to her execution, Susanna prayed to the Lord for help. The boy Daniel came to her defense by asking each elder separately under which tree they had witnessed Susanna’s sin. Their contradictory evidence convinced the community of Susanna’s innocence, and the elders were sentenced to the very death they had planned for Susanna. Everyone rejoiced for Susanna “because nothing shameful was found in her” and from then on “Daniel had a great reputation among the people.” (Susanna 63, 64)\n\nSusanna: Hebrew: Shoshanna – Lily\n\nDaniel: Hebrew: God has Judged\n\n↑ Top\n\nAbout the Composer: Carlisle Floyd\n\nKnown as one of the foremost composers and librettists of American opera, Carlisle Floyd was born in Latta, South Carolina on June 11, 1926. In his works, he has created a distinctively American idiom for opera, drawing on national folk and religious music traditions.\n\nFloyd earned his bachelor’s and master’s degrees in music at Syracuse University. He began his teaching career in 1947 at Florida State University, remaining there until 1976, when he accepted the prestigious M.D. Anderson Professorship at the University of Houston. He is a co-founder of the Houston Grand Opera Studio, a training and performance program for young singers and coach/accompanists, jointly created by the University of Houston and the Houston Grand Opera.\n\nIn addition to his talent as a composer, Floyd serves as his own librettist. His librettos combine penetrating social commentary with astute psychological insight. His themes, such as the aftermath of the Civil War, the Great Depression, and rural fundamentalism, are used as backgrounds for the personal dramas of characters whose stories unfailingly engage the interest and sympathy of the audience.\n\nWith Susannah, Floyd first achieved national prominence as an opera composer/librettist. Premiered in 1955 at Florida State, the work has become a standard of the opera repertoire and has been widely staged in the United States and Europe.\n\nFloyd’s other operas include Of Mice and Men (1970), Bilby’s Doll (1976), and Willie Stark (1981). Recently, the composer has gained increasing attention for his non-operatic works. The 1993 New York premiere of Floyd’s orchestral song cycle, Citizens of Paradise, is based on the poems and letters of Emily Dickinson.\n\nHis musical style has been referred to as “eclectic and conservative.” Floyd’s operas contain powerful dramatic segments, and they continue to flourish. Unlike so many opera composers of other generations, Carlisle Floyd has been able to achieve success and acclaim for his works while still alive.\n\nThe story of Susannah appealed to Floyd, who received a strict Methodist upbringing. His father, a Methodist minister, had been posted to a series of small rural Southern towns, and Carlisle was able to draw on these experiences and memories for his opera. The dramatic possibilities inherent in a revival meeting inspired what Floyd called “the catalytic event” for Susannah, the scene around which all the rest of the work flows.\n\n—Julius Rudel, “My Susannah,” Opera News, April 1999\n\nAdditional Information:\n\nAbout Carlisle Floyd at U.S. Opera\n\nCarlisle Floyd profile from Boosey & Hawkes\n\nIn English, ‘Susannah’ takes the mystique out of opera—article from the Augusta Chronicle, including an interview with Carlisle Floyd, from April 25, 1998\n\n↑ Top\n\nThe Music of Susannah\n\nFrom “My Susannah” by Julius Rudel Opera News April 1999\n\nSusannah draws on traditional and popular music sources, but it also has some full blown arias and rousing choral moments\n\nOpera Prelude – Referred to by Floyd as “Opening Music” – is short and passionate, introducing the audience to the people of New Hope Valley. In three parts: jagged chords suggesting conflict, a lyric broad lament implying tragedy and a coda of dying phrases.\n\nSquare Dance – Opens Act I – the cheerful square dance is in contrast to the nasty comments made by the Elder’s wives in “She’s a Shameless Girl.” This fast-paced music comes to an abrupt halt with the entrance of Olin Blitch.\n\nA hymn-like melody, dignified and pensive, brass chorale establishes Blitch immediately: “I am the Reverend Olin Blitch, and I’ve come to New Hope Valley to cast out devils and conquer sin and bring sinners to repentance….”\n\n“Ain’t it a pretty night?” – Susannah’s aria is the centerpiece of Act II – The piece is filled with dreams, desires and the acknowledgment that there is a wondrous world beyond the valley.\n\nSung by Sam Polk, Susannah’s brother, “Oh, Jaybird Sittin’ on a Hickry Limb” is an authentic-sounding folk song that brings the audience back to the valley.\n\nThe rustle in the orchestra that opens Scene 3 captures the sonic essence of the flowing, shimmering stream. This music leads us to the stream where Susannah bathes. The elders chant in unison “This woman is of the devil. It is a shameful sight to behold” upon intruding on Susannah’s privacy.\n\nThe mood of Scene 4 of Act I is instantly established by the mysterious orchestral introduction – tainted by the dark clouds that pervade the minds of the elders and their wives.\n\nAct I finishes with Little Bat admitting to Susannah his false confession to the Elders and Sam’s tender, brotherly observation “They’ll turn this valley into hell.”\n\nAct II opens musically with static chords dominating the music, supporting the waiting of Susannah and Sam.\n\n“Are you saved from Sin” – The revival meeting is dramatic realism at its best – American verismo. The chorus singing as the congregation’s participation drives the event to a religious frenzy.\n\n“The trees on the mountain” – One of the most heartbreaking of all opera’s arias – captures Susannah’s loneliness, fears and tenderness. Sad chords of the solo harp, lonely and cold, introduce this incredibly beautiful song.\n\n“I’m a lonely man, Susannah” – Blitch abandons his religious demeanor, reaching out to her in this human aria.\n\n“When the congregation gathers” – The music conveys an implicit tension when Blitch tells them he knows that Susannah is innocent\n\n“Oh Lord, I Never Meant Him to Die” sung by Susannah – The opera’s shocking ending weaves together all the strands, textual and musical, in a catastrophic conclusion that is the exclamation point to an ideal dramatic curve.\n\n↑ Top\n\nHistorical Context for 1955\n\n(the year in which Susannah was written)\n\nGovernment and Politics\n\nThe Korean War had just ended.\n\nThe House Un-American Activities Committee was holding its hearings.\n\nAlbania entered the Warsaw pact.\n\nPeron was ousted in Argentina by a military coup.\n\nIreland and Austria joined the United Nations\n\nBen Gurion became Prime Minister of the new nation of Israel\n\nDag Hammarskjold became Secretary General of the United Nations\n\nLabor\n\nAFL-CIO was formed by the merger of the American Federation of Labor and the Congress of Industrial Organizations.\n\nAdditional Information:\n\nThe Literature & Culture of the American 1950s\n\n↑ Top\n\nResources\n\nAdditional resources to expand the learning opportunities\n\nOutline and Special Thanks\n\nElectronic Field Trip to Kentucky Opera Outline:\n\nIntroduction\n\n♪ Welcome to Kentucky Opera\n\n♪ History of Kentucky Opera\n\n♪ A brief history of opera and descriptions of artistic styles\n\nProducing an Opera\n\n♪ How an opera is selected\n\n♪ Auditions\n\n♪ Meet the composer: Carlisle Floyd\n\n♪ Sets, costumes, lighting, and make-up\n\nCareers in the Opera\n\nRehearsals\n\n♪ Singers working with the orchestra\n\n♪ Last minute changes\n\nOpening Night\n\nSpecial Thanks:\n\nSpecial thanks to Gerald Farrar, Director of Public Relations for Kentucky Opera.

Paul and Lucille Caudill Little Arts Endowment.\n\n↑ Top\n\nCareers in the Opera\n\nSo you want to be an opera singer?\n\nMen and women who are professional opera singers study music, performing arts, and vocal performance. Their on-stage performance is the culmination of years of work with private vocal coaches, musicians, and directors.\n\nThe best route leading to a professional career in opera is academically based. A young singer should apply to colleges or universities with strong vocal music departments. It is crucial for a young person to work with a voice teacher with whom they can progress artistically, academically, and professionally.\n\nMusic Schools in Kentucky\n\nArea colleges/universities with vocal music/opera theater departments:\n\n• University of Louisville\n\n• University of Kentucky\n\n• Bellarmine College\n\n• Kentucky State University\n\n• Indiana University\n\n• University of Cincinnati\n\n• Southern Baptist Seminary\n\nThere are other colleges and universities that have vocal music departments. Consult your high school choral director or music teacher for additional information.\n\nTypes of careers\n\nThere are also lots of other jobs with an opera company. To prepare for these, several universities offer programs in arts administration. At the graduate level, these programs are highly selective. Undergraduate programs are offered at the University of Kentucky and Bellarmine College. Graduate programs are offered at Indiana University and the University of Cincinnati College Conservatory of Music. Other universities that offer graduate arts administrative studies are New York University, University of Wisconsin, and UCLA.\n\nWith any career in the performing arts, a young person should get involved with the company of his or her choice.

Here are short biographies on some of today’s most prominent stars in the opera world.\n\nCecilia Bartoli\n\nHer parents were both professional singers, and Bartoli has continued the family tradition, becoming one of the new opera superstars of today. She was born in Rome and attended the Music Conservatory of Santa Cecilia. Her talents were first noticed when she appeared in an Italian television program introducing young talent and “rediscovered” in 1988 during a French telecast dedicated to the memory of the late Maria Callas. Immediately thereafter, Bartoli was sought by two famous conductors and her international career was launched.\n\nAndrea Bocelli\n\nAn ex-lawyer and piano-bar singer, Bocelli learned the great operas by ear and by heart. Born in rural Tuscany, he was fascinated with the great Italian tenors as a child—especially his idol, Franco Corelli—and dreamed of becoming a great tenor. Not sure that dream would come true, he first became a lawyer, then sang in piano bars at night while studying under Corelli. International fame for Bocelli came with “Time To Say Goodbye,” a duet arrangement with Sarah Brightman. His debut international album, Romanza, went platinum and has brought many new fans to the world of opera.\n\nJosé Carreras\n\nBorn in Barcelona, Carreras’ true first name is Josép, the Catalan version of José. He loved to sing as a child and started voice and piano lessons with the mother of one of his childhood friends. His first major role was singing with Montserrat Caballe in Donizetti’s Lucrezia Borgia. By the age of 28, when many opera singers are just starting to make their mark, Carreras had already sung the tenor lead in 24 different operas in both Europe and North America and had made his debuts at the world’s four great opera houses. In 1987, at the height of his success, Carreras was diagnosed with acute leukemia. He recovered and gradually returned to the opera. He is often known as one of the “three tenors” for his concerts with Plácido Domingo and Luciano Pavarotti.\n\nPlácido Domingo\n\nBorn in Madrid, Domingo is one of the world’s leading lyrics because of his unique combination of vocal techniques and acting abilities.

We have used Susannah as an example.\n\nWriting to Learn Prompts\n\nWriting to Learn activities are written by students to capture his or her own reactions to a variety of experiences with themselves as the primary audience. Connections can be made to the following Kentucky’s Academic Expectations: 1.3 Construct meaning through observing 1.11 Communicate via writing 2.23 Analysis of artistic products 6.3 Expand knowledge Following are possible pre and post performance prompts for students.\n\nPre Performance Prompts\n\n• What do you know about opera?\n\n• What do you want to know about opera?\n\n• What questions do you have about the storyline?\n\n• What concerns do you have about attending the performance?\n\n• What stereotypes about opera specifically, and the arts in general, are commonplace in late 20th century American society?\n\nPost Performance Prompts\n\n• What aspects of the performance interested you the most? (music, costumes, scenery, singing, storyline, etc.)\n\n• What did you learn from attending the performance?\n\n• If you were to consider a career in the performing arts, what aspects of the arts would you choose? (writing sample based only on your opera attendance)\n\n• With which character did you identify most? Why?\n\nWriting to Demonstrate Learning\n\nWriting to demonstrate learning activities provide students with the opportunity to show teachers or other assessors what they have learned. Connections can be made to the following Kentucky’s Academic Expectations 2.23 Analysis of artistic products 2.24 Appreciation of the arts 2.25 Understanding of influences on the arts 2.26 Demonstration of diversity awareness\n\nOpen response questions invite students to apply their knowledge of concepts to new situations.\n\n1. During a performance of a play, ballet or opera, the audience is usually given clues about the time and location of the action. If you saw Kentucky Opera’s production of Susannah, discuss three changes you would make to give the audience additional clues about the time and location of the events in the opera.\n\n2. Carlisle Floyd set his opera Susannah in New Hope Valley, Tennessee. The time of the opera is “the present.” Discuss three ways in which the south and/or “the present” are identifiable within the opera.\n\nEssays\n\nAcademic essays allow students to demonstrate their knowledge in a more formal way. Prewriting for the essay may require students to engage in research.\n\n1. Describe in essay format how the character of Susannah or a major character in the opera you saw changes from the beginning of the opera to the end of the opera. In your essay, include a description of the effect of the influence of other characters on her.\n\n2. Susannah is an opera that has often been referred to as a “folk opera.” The characters’ timeless emotions range from the innocence to malice. The opera is set in Tennessee, and was written in the 1950’s. Rewrite the opera by changing the setting and era the action takes place. In your opera, be sure to accurately depict gender roles, religious connotations and relationships.\n\n3. Research 20th century American composers. Focus a report on 20th century American music on American opera. Evaluate the operas that have been written and the level of acceptance of these pieces have had by opera audiences. Recommend how these new works should be presented to audiences for wider appeal.\n\nWriting Portfolio – Authentic Writing Prompts\n\n• Authentic writing, or writing for an authentic purpose in a “real world” context, is a writing style that is targeted to a non-captive audience that is less informed about the subject. Authentic writing pieces are suitable for inclusion and scoring in Kentucky public school writing portfolios.\n\n• Connections can be made to the following Kentucky’s Academic Expectations 1.11 Communicate via writing 2.23 Analysis of artistic products 2.24 Appreciation of the arts.\n\nStudents write:\n\n1. A review of Kentucky Opera’s production of Floyd’s Susannah, targeting readers who have never been to an opera. Purpose: Evaluate the performance and persuade readers to attend other opera performances.\n\n2. A feature article for the school newspaper about some aspect of opera production in which they have a special interest, such as costume design, set design and construction, or education needed for a career in the arts.\n\n3. A brochure or article for other students their age who are attending an opera for the first time. Purpose: Tips for first time opera-goers on what to do before, during and after the performance to receive the most enjoyment and benefit from the experience.\n\n4. A technical review (as opposed to the traditional review which usually critiques the performance of actors/singers and the skills of stage directors) of the opera production.

To show your appreciation of their performance, you may respond with applause. The following are helpful hints for fulfilling your role as an audience member:\n\nDo\n\n♪ enter the auditorium quietly.\n\n♪ use the restroom before the performance begins.\n\n♪ watch the performers closely. Even if a performer is not singing or speaking, he or she will be engaged in actions that will pertain to the story.\n\n♪ listen to the words being sung by the performers.\n\n♪ applaud. While it is appropriate to shout “bravo” to show appreciation, it is important to note that “bravo” is traditionally used for the performance of a male singer, while “brava” is traditionally used for a female singer, and “Bravi” is used for a group of singers.\n\n♪ have fun!\n\nDon’t\n\n♪ take pictures of the performers while they are on stage. This could distract the singers, leading to a mistake in their performance.\n\n♪ talk to the person sitting next to you during the performance. This disturbs others around you — not allowing them to hear the story and enjoy the performance. Most importantly, the performers can hear you talking from the stage!\n\n♪ get up or move excessively unless absolutely necessary. This is equally distracting to the artists and other audience members.\n\nFor the Teacher\n\nThe classroom teacher can be a leader in showing his or her students how to act while attending a live performance. Opera is a special event, and should be treated with respect. The performance space is an extension of the regular classroom, and some of the same rules apply.\n\n↑ Top\n\nRelated Links\n\nThe Academy of Vocal Arts is the only tuition-free institution dedicated exclusively to the study of voice.\n\nFor Opera has profiles of legendary performers and composers, including Luciano Pavarotti, Leontyne Price, José Carreras, Plácido Domingo, Denyce Graves, and Cecilia Bartoli.\n\nOpera America includes links to all the major opera houses in the United States and a catalog of publications designed specifically for teachers.\n\nOperabase has biographies of 5,000 composers and 2,800 singers, a database of 500 opera houses and festivals, and opera resource pages.\n\nU.S. Opera is dedicated to opera by American composers.
