And few shows have arrived on Broadway as little known as ‚ÄúFlying Over Sunset,‚Äù which opens at the Vivian Beaumont Theater on April 16. Not only is it a new musical but it‚Äôs also an entirely original one, with no precursor movie, novel, cartoon or play to give it shape and curb appeal. Whatever it is, it will have to succeed on its own. Which is not to say it has no names attached; it‚Äôs dripping with names. You may have heard of its three main characters, for instance, all hanging around Hollywood in the mid-1950s: Cary Grant, debonair movie star; Clare Booth Luce, ambassador and congresswoman; Aldous Huxley, British intellectual. Or the three inside-Broadway actors who play them: Tony Yazbeck (‚ÄúOn the Town‚Äù) as Grant, Carmen Cusack (‚ÄúBright Star‚Äù) as Luce, Harry Hadden-Paton (‚ÄúMy Fair Lady‚Äù) as Huxley. Then there are the names backstage. The music is by Tom Kitt (‚ÄúNext to Normal‚Äù), the lyrics by Michael Korie (‚ÄúGrey Gardens‚Äù), the book and direction by James Lapine (‚ÄúSunday in the Park With George‚Äù). I am sure the prop master is illustrious, too. So what are all these promising names promising? I‚Äôm happy not to know much more than that the three main characters, each of whom experimented with LSD at the time, in Lapine‚Äôs fictional world share trips together. The characters sing only when they‚Äôre high; with any luck, that‚Äôs how they‚Äôll leave the audience, too.‚Äù\n\n‚ÄìJesse Green, The New York Times, February 26, 2020\n\n‚ÄúYears before Timothy Leary popularized psychedelic experimentation, LSD found a home in Hollywood. Lysergic acid diethylamide‚Äîthen legal‚Äîwas used in elite circles during the 1950s, employed in hush- hush psychiatric treatments. Flying Over Sunset, a new musical at Lincoln Center Theater, uses that relatively unknown history to tell the story of three public figures in crisis, not the hedonistic excesses usually associated with psychedelia.\n\nWritten and directed by three-time Tony-winning scribe James Lapine with Tony-winning composer Tom Kitt and Tony-nominated lyricist Michael Korie, Flying Over Sunset imagines a shared acid trip between Hollywood leading man Cary Grant (Tony Yazbeck), conservative politician Clare Boothe Luce (Carmen Cusack) and novelist and early LSD enthusiast Aldous Huxley (Harry Hadden-Paton). In real life, each used the drug in the 1950s: Grant entirely committed himself to the new psychotherapy, (re)-reinventing his life, Luce discovered the treatment from her friend Gerald Heard (Robert Sella) and, in 1954, Huxley authored the now famous psychedelic text, The Doors of Perception, each turning to LSD for deep introspective help. But ‚Äúit‚Äôs not about the drug,‚Äù said Korie in a recent Building Broadway interview with Beth Stevens. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs about sunset. It‚Äôs about reaching that time in your life when you‚Äôve had accomplishments, where you‚Äôve had disappointments, and you‚Äôre not yet complete.‚Äù\n\nLapine first began work on Flying Over Sunset after reading a 2010 Vanity Fair article that exposed LSD‚Äôs journey into the lives of nearly 100 luminaries. Psychiatrists, the article narrated, began employing LSD-25 in psychoanalysis after the U.S. Army and the C.I.A. discovered the drug could be used as a truth serum. For Lapine, that most of these Hollywood somebodies, privately in turmoil, operated publicly in (perhaps) the same circles offered an intriguing project.\n\n‚ÄúWhat I like about these three very accomplished, very brilliant people, was that they felt unfulfilled,‚Äù Lapine said. ‚ÄúThey turned to the drug to find out more about themselves. They were not youngsters, you know. They were mid-career and mid-life. Each had a crisis point in their lives, and it wasn‚Äôt taken frivolously. Huxley really was upset when Leary made it a social event to take LSD, because he never thought of it that way. He thought of it as a kind of serious undertaking.‚Äù\n\nThe musical, almost dreamlike in nature, follows Grant, Luce and Huxley as they drop acid to explore the recesses of their memories, haunted by lost loved ones and figures from their past. ‚ÄúIt starts in the early afternoon or late morning,‚Äù said Korie. ‚ÄúThey each take the drug, different doses, and then it starts kicking in differently for each of them. They get giddy. They get crazy, and they start hallucinating. By then, it‚Äôs sunset and they‚Äôre looking at the sunset over the Pacific Ocean.‚Äù\n\nAt that moment, the metaphor at the heart of Flying Over Sunset‚Äînot of cruising high over Hollywood on new-age psychedelics, but of approaching the second half of one‚Äôs life‚Äîcomes into focus. ‚ÄúTrying to understand the world they live in spoke to me,‚Äù Lapine said. ‚ÄúWhat are they going to do next? Cary Grant quit the movies. Clare Booth Luce had resigned as the ambassador to Brazil, and Aldous Huxley‚Äôs wife, with whom he‚Äôd been joined at the hip for 30-odd years, had passed away. Each of them were at a juncture in their lives trying to figure out what their next chapter was going to be,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúThat appealed to me, because, I guess, I felt the same way.‚Äù\n\nFlying Over Sunset marks the first musical from Lapine in nearly 10 years. He is perhaps best known for his writing and directing partnership with composer/lyricist Stephen Sondheim on Sunday in the Park with George (1983), Into the Woods (1987) and Passion (1994), as well as his 1992 collaboration with William Finn on Falsettos.\n\nLapine has a knack for telling achingly human stories, whether it‚Äôs an obsessive pointillist painter or a flawed fairy tale character. Flying Over Sunset is no different, said composer Kitt. ‚ÄúI knew it was going to be about deep human issues,‚Äù he said, ‚Äúand that LSD was going to be a vehicle to probe, to question and to look at hard truths, the way Into the Woods isn‚Äôt about fairy tales.‚Äù\n\nIn this way, Flying Over Sunset isn‚Äôt so much about LSD as it is about using the drug to crack open the inner lives of its characters. This is ‚Äúwhy you want to write musicals,‚Äù said Kitt. ‚ÄúYou want to go into an imaginative, creative world‚Äîsomething that‚Äôs going to challenge you and demand the most of your imagination, not knowing what each moment is going to be, but just knowing that anything is possible.‚Äù‚Äù\n\n‚ÄìMichael Appler, Broadway.com Buzz, February 28, 2020\n\n‚Äú‚ÄúDuring my LSD sessions, I would learn a great deal,‚Äù Cary Grant once said. In the late fifties and early sixties, when the drug was used as an experimental medical aid, Grant regularly took supervised acid trips at the Psychiatric Institute of Beverly Hills. (He once envisioned himself as a penis launching from Earth like a rocket ship.) ‚ÄúFlying Over Sunset,‚Äù a new musical by James Lapine, Tom Kitt, and Michael Korie, imagines a 1957 trip shared by Grant (Tony Yazbeck) and two other luminaries known to have dabbled in LSD‚Äîthe ambassador Clare Boothe Luce (Carmen Cusack) and the author Aldous Huxley (Harry Hadden-Paton). Lapine‚Äôs production, for Lincoln Center Theatre, starts previews on March 12, at the Vivian Beaumont.‚Äù\n\n‚ÄìMichael Schulman, The New Yorker, March 9, 2020\n\nMEDIA\n\nOff-Broadway Production\n\nPlaywrights Horizons, 2006\n\nBroadway Production\n\nWalter Kerr Theater, 2006\n\nBook by Doug Wright\n\nMusic by Scott Frankel\n\nLyrics by Michael Korie\n\nDirected by Michael Greif\n\nChoreographed by Jeff Calhoun\n\nMusic Direction by Lawrence Yurman\n\nScenic Design by Allen Moyer\n\nCostume Design by William Ivey Long\n\nLighting Design by Peter Kaczorowski\n\nSound Design by Brian Ronan\n\nOrchestrations by Bruce Coughlin\n\nWith Christine Ebersole,\n\nMary Louise Wilson, Erin Davie,\n\nJohn McMartin, Sarah Hyland,\n\nMatt Cavenaugh, Bob Stillman,\n\nMichael Potts, Kelsey Fowler\n\nNational Productions\n\nCenter Theatre Group, Los Angeles, 2016\n\nAhmanson Theatre\n\nWith Betty Buckley and Rachel York\n\nDirected by Michael Wilson\n\nInternational Productions\n\nTokyo, Osaka and Nagoya, Japan, 2009\n\nToho Productions\n\nDirected by Amon Miyamoto\n\nWith Shinobu Otake and Mitsuko Kusabue\n\nMelbourne, Australia, 2012\n\nArts Centre Playhouse\n\nDirected by Roger Hodgman\n\nWith Pamela Rabe and Nancy Hayes\n\nRio de Janeiro, Brazil, 2013\n\nPowell Hall\n\nDirected by Wolf Maya\n\nWith Suely Franco and Soraya Ravenle\n\nLondon, Great Britain, 2016\n\nSouthwark Playhouse\n\nDirected by Thom Southerland\n\nWith Sheila Hancock and Jenna Russell\n\nProduced by Danielle Tarento\n\nPRESS\n\n‚ÄúWright and his collaborators, Scott Frankel and Michael Korie, have taken their cue from the Maysles brothers in portraying their multifaceted subjects with depth and dignity. Their show is a haunting account of lives derailed, a textured depiction of the warring, often simultaneous desires to wound and heal that characterize mother-daughter relationships, and a witty celebration of two defiantly maverick personalities‚Ä¶ The high points remain unchallenged: Christine Ebersole‚Äôs ‚ÄòRevolutionary Costume‚Äô and brilliant Act One closer ‚ÄòWill You?‚Äô; Mary Louise Wilson‚Äôs ‚ÄòJerry Likes My Corn,‚Äô a seemingly whimsical song that spins the most unlikely snatch of dialogue into a complex piece of character-and-conflict-building; Ebersole‚Äôs schizoid ‚ÄòAround the World,‚Äô which lurches grippingly between bitter accusation and the sad imprisonment of memory; and her heartbreaking closing number, ‚ÄòAnother Winter in a Summer Town.‚Äô Performed on the first press night by Ebersole with tears streaming down her face, that song now segues into a superbly reworked final scene of piercing melancholy. In a Broadway arena that can be unaccommodating for ‚Äòserious‚Äô musicals, Grey Gardens is as boldly odd, original and beguiling as its subjects.‚Äù\n\n‚Äî David Rooney, Variety, November 2, 2006\n\n‚ÄúHome, in the modern theater, is where everything hellish happens. Grey Gardens by this light must be the definitive modernist musical, the only one I can think of in which the house is the title character. The Beale women and their crumbling, cat-infested house are part of history. Grey Gardens fascinates, because like many modernist works, it upholds a tradition while simultaneously trashing it to hell and back, the tradition in this case being that of the old-style Broadway musical‚Ä¶ Scott Frankel‚Äôs pastiche score, set to cunningly wry lyrics by Michael Korie, both invents and mercilessly parodies a world of ancient Tin Pan Alley tunes. Grey Gardens feels like a Broadway musical, a modernist musical that belongs on the street where modern playwrights built all those unhappy houses which inextricably open fourth walls.‚Äù\n\n‚Äî Michael Feingold, The Village Voice, November 6, 2006\n\n‚ÄúThe songs from Grey Gardens, with music by Scott Frankel and lyrics by Michael Korie, sustain a level of refined language and psychological detail as elevated as Stephen Sondheim‚Äôs. Grey Gardens is an artfully skewed variation on a traditional musical that belongs to the line that connects Mr. Sondheim with Kurt Weill‚Ä¶The score is a meticulously fashioned piece of musical theater that gains in depth the more you listen to it. The songs expertly integrate recitative and speech into a seamless narrative flow that never loses its verbal acuity. Mr. Korie‚Äôs rhymes are all the more impressive for being at once original and unforced. At the same time, they are packed with specific historical references‚Ä¶ ‚ÄòHominy Grits,‚Äô a minstrel show number sung in vintage black dialect, wants to make you squirm even as you admire its gemlike craft. In the second act the music for Grey Gardens curdles into a kind of off-kilter American Gothic style, as the walls close in around the characters and their cats, and their minds wander. Their self-delusion and competitive symbiosis are rendered with clinical insight in the creepy ‚ÄòJerry Likes My Corn.‚Äô ‚ÄòAround the World,‚Äô a ditty sung by Little Edie while ruminating in an attic filled with mementos, sticks to your mind like flypaper‚Ä¶ As Little Edie looks back on her youth, when she was romanced (and then dropped) by the young Joseph Kennedy Jr., her imagination still lingers in the debutante dream world of her past:\n\nThe pink paper lanterns\n\nStill twinkle in place.\n\nMy young Navy hero,\n\nHis tender embrace.\n\nThat sapphire blue ocean‚Ä¶\n\nOh, how can I face\n\nAnother Winter in a Summer Town?\n\nThis beautiful song is quietly terrifying. Grey Gardens is a portrait of decay whose songs artfully mimic that process until you are left aghast at the waste and sadness of it all; it leaves you no exit.\n\n‚ÄìStephen Holden, The New York Times, February 9, 2007\n\n‚ÄúCan a musical be hilarious and heartbreaking at the same time? Grey Gardens can. Here‚Äôs that shot in the arm for theater lovers who‚Äôve been longing for something bold, haunting, and hypnotic to get lost in‚Ä¶ The nuanced, compassionate book by Doug Wright never stoops to condescension of Baby Jane histrionics‚Ä¶ And save a rousing cheer for the music of Scott Frankel and the lyrics of Michael Korie. In an era of jukebox musicals, here is an original score with the power to live in your head long after you leave the theater. Get the cast album, pronto. Wilson turns ‚ÄòJerry Likes My Corn,‚Äô a seeming throwaway about the simple joys an old woman takes in making corn for a handyman (the excellent Matt Cavenaugh), into a portrait in miniature of an entire life. And Ebersole is the best friend a song ever had, whether she‚Äôs caressing a ballad (‚ÄòWill You?‚Äô; ‚ÄòAround the World‚Äô), bringing down the house with laughter (‚ÄòRevolutionary Costume for Today‚Äô) or leaving you emotionally shattered with a final number, ‚ÄòAnother Winter in a Summer Town,‚Äô that sounds like a classic song in the making. Bob Stillman deserves a special shout-out as George Gould Strong, Big Edie‚Äôs gay accompanist, whose song ‚ÄòDrift Away‚Äô brings depth to what could have been a stock character. Grey Gardens is more than a unique and unmissable musical: it‚Äôs a gift.‚Äù\n\n‚ÄìPeter Travers, Rolling Stone, November 6, 2006\n\n‚ÄúThe quality and emotional oomph of this musical flows from a rare ability to move and provoke an audience on matters personal and existential. The show ponders the hell that unyielding parents can bring down on their dependent children and grandchildren, regardless of the resources at their disposal. It notes that happiness‚Äìin love, in life‚Äìmay be a one-shot deal that vanishes forever. It reminds the rich and powerful that they might end their lives in depressing circumstances. And most important of all, it shrewdly and evenhandedly explores the way mother and daughter are locked for life, even if it‚Äôs to their detriment. In Grey Gardens, the deeply moving and exquisitely performed new Broadway show, their fall mirrors our deepest insecurities.‚Äù\n\n‚ÄìChris Jones, The Chicago Tribune, November 3, 2006\n\n‚ÄúThe tunes in Act One, by composer Scott Frankel and lyricist Michael Korie, are light, elegant, witty in the Cole Porter and George Gershwin mode. Things shift for Act Two, with a score that is atonal, bitter, and distinctly sardonic. Frankel and Korie‚Äôs songs are gorgeous, with sharp, vivid lyrics‚Ä¶ a literate, emotionally rich score.‚Äù\n\n‚ÄìDavid Cote, NY1, November 3, 2006\n\n‚ÄúAn experience no passionate theatergoer should miss.‚Äù\n\n‚Äî Ben Brantley, The New York Times, November 3, 2006\n\nMEDIA\n\nARVE Error: src mismatch\n\nprovider: youtube\n\nurl: https://www.youtube.com/watch?list=UUcuxghCkC2RxcZdt5QT72cg&time_continue=116&v=ex7XPth9P2Y\n\nsrc: https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/ex7XPth9P2Y?list=UUcuxghCkC2RxcZdt5QT72cg\n\nsrc gen: https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/ex7XPth9P2Y?start=116&list=UUcuxghCkC2RxcZdt5QT72cg\n\nFURTHER READING\n\nNew York Times Interview with Christine Ebersole\n\nCharles McGrath/NY Times: ‚ÄúThe Cat Ladies Sing‚Äù\n\nOn Broadway\n\nNederlander Theater, 2017\n\nPre-Broadway Premiere\n\nGoodman Theater, 2016\n\nBook by Doug Wright\n\nMusic by Scott Frankel\n\nLyrics by Michael Korie\n\nDirected by Michael Greif\n\nProduced by David Stone & Marc Platt\n\nChoreographed by Christopher Gatelli\n\nMusic Direction by Lawrence Yurman\n\nScenic Design by David Korins\n\nCostume Design by Catherine Zuber\n\nLighting Design by Kenneth Posner\n\nSound Design by Brian Ronan\n\nOrchestrations by Bruce Coughlin\n\nWith Patti LuPone, Christine Ebersole,\n\nJohn Dossett, Douglas Sills,\n\nBarbara Jo Bednarczuk, Patti Cohenour,\n\nMary Ernster, Tom Galantich,\n\nDavid Girolmo, Joanna Glushak, Chris Hoch,\n\nMary Claire King, Steffanie Leigh,\n\nErik Liberman, Barbara Marineau,\n\nDonna Migliaccio, Stephanie Jae Park,\n\nAngel Reda, Jennifer Rias, Tally Sessions\n\nPRESS\n\n‚ÄúPatti LuPone and Christine Ebersole, Broadway‚Äôs finest, in richly distinctive roles that play to their respective strengths‚Ä¶ and their contrasting turns here are simply mesmerizing. If this review ends up unfinished, just assume I died and went to show-queen heaven. ‚Äù\n\n‚ÄìDavid Rooney, The Hollywood Reporter, April 6, 1017\n\n‚ÄúLuPone and Ebersole wrap their prodigious voices around a score by Scott Frankel and Michael Korie that rings with the kind of exhilaratingly brassy notes that match the chutzpah of their characters‚Äô ambitions. War Paint is a welcome reminder of old-school Broadway craftsmanship and of the offbeat subjects that musical minds can illuminate with surprising elegance‚Ä¶ A major musical.‚Äù\n\n‚ÄìPeter Marks, The Washington Post, July 19, 2016\n\n‚ÄúThe score filled with real theater songs {is} as good as Broadway gets. Frankel finds hundreds of inventive ways to use period pastiche, in this case ranging from operetta giddiness to Bernstein angst, to express the vitality of the women‚Äôs ambition and explore the undercurrents of their despair. Naturally, he writes to the gifts of his leading ladies, giving LuPone plenty of red meat and sharp angles and Ebersole a series of long-line arias that keep shifting keys as if unable to find a place to rest. The singing that results is almost too rich to be believed. And what a pleasure it is to be hit by the fusillade of classic (and accurate) Broadway rhyming with which Korie loads his lyrics. These are not just the fun, uptempo kind but the kind that bite with insight. In a sad, contemplative duet called ‚ÄúIf I‚Äôd Been a Man,‚Äù he nails the eternal dilemma of the businesswoman in a nifty couplet: ‚ÄúA man can be an absent parent. / Stray the way a woman daren‚Äôt.‚Äù War Paint is studded with such irreducible observations.‚Äù\n\n‚ÄìJesse Green, Vulture, April 6, 2017\n\n‚ÄúThis is a musical whose beauty is far more than skin deep. It not only explores the psyches of two ‚Äúoutsiders‚Äù who refuse to be denied, but captures the enduring discrimination rooted in gender, social class and age. And it traces the evolution of a major industry, along with all the shifting attitudes about female beauty, workplace opportunity, and marketing and media trends that went with them. The classic tension between career and romance faced by women hellbent on making a mark is crucial here, as is the particularly high price in loneliness paid by those who pursue the kind of success men tend to take in stride. The warping (and simultaneously inspiring) effect of cutthroat competition is in play throughout. And the matter of legacy ‚Äî a big theme in ‚ÄúHamilton,‚Äù too ‚Äî is here very much attuned to how it plays out for women.‚Äù\n\n‚ÄìHedy Weiss, Chicago Sun Times, July 18, 2016\n\n‚ÄúThe show is a demonstration of offbeat theatrical craftiness. We are treated to a barrage of clever parallelisms that depict how much these two very different women had in common, until the climactic scene when they wind up in the same dressing room as accidentally-paired guests of honor. The heavily melodic score finds ingenious ways of pairing them in mutual contemplation ‚Äî the duet ‚ÄúIf I‚Äôd Been a Man‚Äù is only the most obvious opportunity, as each considers what it would be like to have their ambition go unquestioned. Their final duet, ‚ÄúBeauty in the World,‚Äù only confirms what we have seen all along. They are peas in a pod, rivals who never would have worked so hard, achieved so much, without the competition of the other. It‚Äôs a satisfying ending to a richly rewarding show.‚Äù\n\n‚ÄìSteven Oxman, Variety, July 19, 2016\n\n‚ÄúThe claws are out in War Paint ‚Äî and boy, are they perfectly lacquered. The musical tells the gripping story of Rubinstein and Arden‚Äôs careers, warts and all. Because of their impenetrable rivalry, every scene save for the finale involves either LuPone or Ebersole commanding center stage. At times, they share the space and sing the same lyrics, and it‚Äôs a true treat for the audience when the stars‚Äô velvet voices harmonize.

[Far From Heaven] is full of the pleasures of a century‚Äôs worth of song, not used as pastiche, but as characterization of the individuals and their normative milieu. The score is completely fresh, often heartbreakingly lovely, and sometimes terrifying‚Ä¶ Well, there‚Äôs not much like Far From Heaven in recent musicals at all. The singular achievement of Far From Heaven is to have turned so much seriousness‚Äîso much fury and pain‚Äîinto so much songwriting beauty.‚Äù\n\n‚ÄìJesse Green, Theater Critic, New York Magazine\n\n‚ÄúFar From Heaven is actually pretty close to heavenly. It‚Äôs smart, sophisticated, and a perfect vehicle for Kelli O‚ÄôHara‚Äôs soaring voice and endearing stage presence. The transporting, potent show has an elegant diversity of music by Scott Frankel. Thoughtful lyrics by Michael Korie sensitively express the characters‚Äô turbulent inner emotions‚Ä¶A dark aura of repressed sensuality alternates with scenes of suburban placidity. Quiet introspective numbers are mixed with fuzzy, funny ones like ‚ÄòMarital Bliss,‚Äô a cocktail fueled discussion by women about how often they have sex. A would-be romantic vacation in Miami features a wonderful, Latin-tinged nightclub number as closeted gay men exchange longing glances during ‚ÄòWandering Eyes.‚Äô Difficult emotional journeys are beautifully rendered in Far From Heaven, and the musical is profoundly effective.‚Äù\n\n‚ÄìJennifer Farrar, Associated Press, June 2, 2013\n\n‚ÄúThe most important part of any musical is the score. And Far from Heaven ‚Äî about prejudice and repressed desire in 1957 Connecticut ‚Äî boasts a gorgeously lush and evocative score. Composer Scott Frankel and lyricist Michael Korie easily topped their Tony-nominated work from Grey Gardens. The songs are not just well-crafted, but tuneful, too: You‚Äôll leave with the haunting ‚ÄòThe Only One‚Äô firmly lodged in your head. One song in particular, ‚ÄòTuesdays, Thursdays‚Äô captures Cathy‚Äôs disillusion as she looks back on her perfect world. ‚ÄòPromises I put my faith in,‚Äô she sings, her heart crumbling.‚Äù\n\n‚ÄìElisabeth Vincentelli, New York Post, June 3, 2013\n\n‚ÄúFar From Heaven is far from your typical Broadway musical.

The Grapes of Wrath might be it. Called ‚ÄòVerdi on steroids,‚Äô at the premiere that assessment was wondrously born out of Gordon‚Äôs amazing and unusual score of monumental dimensions‚Ä¶The Grapes of Wrath is of epic sweep and of a mesmerizing grandeur that makes the audience participants in the Joads‚Äô flight from Oklahoma to California in the depth of the Great Depression. It is the product of a collective of gifted artists‚Ä¶ Librettist Michael Korie has stripped down Steinbeck‚Äôs 600 pages to a lean and sing-able text in verse that only occasionally rhymes and retains the speech patterns of the Okies. The score‚Äìwithout recitative‚Äìis song based and many scenes flow easily into the next. Despite the darkness and overt tragedy of their story, Gordon and Korie lower the curtain with hope‚Ä¶ their story is not told; it is lived out with compelling immediacy before the eyes of the audience, who make the journey with them. Gordon and Korie have created a new‚Äìand American‚Äìsong of the earth.‚Äù\n\n‚ÄìWes Blomster, Musical America, February 13, 2007\n\n‚ÄúWhat a show! Opera Theatre of St. Louis has opened The Grapes of Wrath, a work by Ricky Ian Gordon and Michael Korie. I have never in my life been more emotionally moved by an opera than by this glorious production. The Opera Theatre of St. Louis commissioned this newly ‚Äústreamlined‚Äù version. It‚Äôs in two-acts, has a cast of forty and runs nearly three hours, so the original three-act, four-hour work must have been epic indeed. Be that as it may this current version is a work of remarkable beauty and power. Michael Korie‚Äôs libretto is natural and colloquial and very true to the time and place. It‚Äôs also true to Steinbeck‚Äôs subtle but pervasive Old Testament flavor, which comes clearly through in names, phrases, images and themes.‚Äù\n\n‚ÄìSteve Callahan, BroadwayWorld, May 31, 2017\n\n‚ÄúThe Grapes of Wrath has teeth‚Ä¶Ricky Ian Gordon, working in tandem with his librettist, Michael Korie, has found ways to leave its rage intact, even as he gives lyric voice to the suffering Joad clan. The opera achieves its impact because it does not skimp on detail and preserves the hugeness of Steinbeck‚Äôs canvas. Brecht wanted to use opera as a kind of Trojan horse, to enter the palaces of upper classes and prick their conscience. Gordon, Korie, and the Minnesota Opera seem to have had a similar purpose in mind. ‚Äù\n\n‚ÄìAlex Ross, The New Yorker, March 5, 2007\n\n‚ÄúIt‚Äôs rewarding to see the book‚Äôs earthy, oppressive storyline lent new life in this Minnesota Opera world premiere, which adheres closely to Steinbeck‚Äôs aesthetic and morality while extracting waves of beauty and transcendence along the way. The opera begins with a show of strength from composer Ricky Ian Gordon and librettist Michael Korie that is carried through the night: cast and chorus sing in starkly elemental terms of the final rain to fall upon the Oklahoma plains, followed by crushing drought. Gordon‚Äôs simple melody unfolds beneath Korie‚Äôs plain-spoken lyrics, describing the landscape that propels all the action to follow, until a final haunting description of the sere, blasted world of the Dust Bowl‚Ä¶ Korie‚Äôs lyrics are almost perfectly matched to Gordon‚Äôs score. As the music ranges from high to low, Korie writes passages of piercing beauty, then follows with rhyming couplets that both ably tell the story and evoke the poetry of the characters‚Äô tortured lives. He uses blunt, forceful words that elevate the work‚Äôs emotionalism by mixing fatalism with optimism until the opera begins to sing in the range of the universal‚Ä¶ Perhaps the most evocative sequences of the evening arrives at the end of the second act, when Noah drowns himself. Korie writes a heartbreaking lyric; dry eyes are in short supply‚Ä¶ One is tempted to take issue with the show‚Äôs length, at a fraction under four hours, but looking back, it‚Äôs extremely difficult to identify any passage as superfluous, any scene as extraneous. Gordon and Korie have produced a bit of a conundrum: a very long show about suffering and endurance that leaves the viewer enlivened. The intelligence and compassion of their work, combined with the evident vitality and belief of the cast in this opera‚Äôs merit, supply high emotion with depth and compassion. This is not a happy story, but its telling is nothing short of incandescent.‚Äù\n\n‚ÄìQuinton Skinner, Variety, February 16, 2007\n\n‚ÄúThe Grapes of Wrath represents a near-perfect match-up of composer, librettist, and source material. Gordon is mercifully unafraid to show his gift for melody. Grapes gives most of the main characters distinctive numbers, and recapitulates them a lot so you remember them. Korie also does a virtuosic job of transforming a long and discursive book into an opera that manages to contain a lot of the flavor of the original without feeling like merely a recitation of its main plot points, in language that is very much his own. The Opera Theater of St. Louis has made something of a specialty of having composers revisit works that had initial big successes but subsequently languished. It‚Äôs a valuable function, and I hope this shortened Grapes has a longer active life.‚Äù\n\n‚ÄìAnne Midgette, The Washington Post, June 19, 2017\n\n‚ÄúComposer Ricky Ian Gordon‚Äôs fluent, powerful setting of a great American novel, The Grapes of Wrath, has drawn critical raves and silenced many of the naysayers who bemoan the lack of another great American opera of the stature of Porgy and Bess. Librettist Michael Korie took on the Dust Bowl novel at full worth, bypassing the upbeat philosophy that ends the famlus John Form film version in favor of the stark tragedy of the Steinbeck original. This Grapes of Wrath suggests a staying power. Partly it is the humility, the willingness of composer and librettist to let Steinbeck‚Äôs overpowering textual lyricism rest undisturbed. Maybe, this time, that creaky old institution known as opera really has turned a corner.‚Äù\n\n‚ÄìAlan Rich, Bloomberg.com, September 8, 2008\n\n‚ÄúThis is a great American opera to stand alongside earlier evocations of specifically American periods and subjects by George Gershwin, Carlisle Floyd, Robert Ward, John Adams and others.‚Äù\n\n‚ÄìJohn von Rhein, Chicago Tribune, June 20, 2017\n\n‚ÄúGordon and Korie have found the timeless and timely essence of Steinbeck‚Äôs epic. The Grapes of Wrath, with a strong, literate libretto by Michael Korie, is a success. It works not because it is true to Steinbeck‚Äôs style but because it honors his spirit‚Ä¶ The political undercurrent of Steinbeck‚Äôs novel is not neglected. The Joad family‚Äôs journey to California is a tragedy because these people don‚Äôt understand the power of those who abuse them. Verdi seems Gordon‚Äôs and Korie‚Äôs model for showing the individual struggling against the system. Gordon and Korie are hope-seekers. Tragedy overcomes the Joad clan, but Gordon has a limitless reserve of song for them‚Ä¶The audience happily hummed the opera‚Äôs hummable tunes in the lobby during intermissions. As far as I was concerned, the nearly four-hour opera was too short. I would have gladly returned for more.‚Äù\n\n‚ÄìMark Swed, The Los Angeles Times, February 17, 2007\n\n‚ÄúMichael Korie‚Äôs libretto is sustained free verse, a treatment of the American vernacular, as sensitive and authentic as I‚Äôve ever heard outside my native American South. Ricky Gordon‚Äôs music is an Ozark stream in the springtime, full of energy, muddy here, turbulent there, calm and sweet in crystalline pools that refresh the soul, but dangerous and deadly on the loose. Fitted with virtuosity to the words of Steinbeck and his characters he created, and in a partnership with their often-balletic movement, the music takes on the shudders of melancholy and dread. It is synchronous, affectingly lyrical and, in the rich context of relationships with Thomson and Copland, an exultation of an indigenous and thoroughly American art. Through the course of the evening, it spills from stage and pit and attaches itself to a listener‚Äôs spirit. It is revealed to be, in the end, affectingly noble. Nowadays, for operas, and really for any legitimate work of Art with a capital A, the industry of those who create it can no longer be a form simply to entertain us, and make us laugh, or cry, and to produce tunes one can whistle and hum while strolling into the darkness. In the frisson of such magnificence as The Grapes of Wrath, it is sad to say, gentle readers, that it appears in 2017 we in the same rutted, misbegotten track, and only hard work and risk and sacrifice can save us. But we cannot forget the power and the majesty of art as a sustaining force and as a source of hope and optimism. The Grapes of Wrath, on the page and as music in the air, is a harbinger of possibilities such as those, and as art so often does, revelations strike forcefully and come from sources we can only imagine.‚Äù\n\n‚ÄìRobert W. Duffy, St. Louis Magazine, June 1, 2017\n\n‚ÄúDistills the story to all the big moments strung skillfully together with well-defined character relationships and spare, meaningful dialogue.

The piece is an echo chamber of mystical notions. Everything is intended to resonate with religious significance, from the ten singers ‚Äì the quorum of Jewish prayer and, in this case, an emblem of God‚Äôs ten mystical attributes ‚Äì to the piece‚Äôs seven movements beginning at the Gate of Creation and ending at the Gate of Sabbat. The music is powerful, the libretto compelling, owing to the quality of the music and the intelligence with which the libretto has been crafted out of Jewish sources. How often is opera sung almost exclusively in Hebrew and Aramaic? Phrases float up from the writings of the 13th century mystic Abraham Abulafia, from the Talmud, the Zohar: ‚ÄòRabbi Hiya and Rabbi Judah came to some huge mountains, in the ravines of which they found human bones left over from the generation of the flood.‚Äô Implicit in this piece is an understanding that the modern eye, following the libretto, will tolerate the disjunction of meaning between sentences, just as the modern ear, hearing contemporary music, finds in dissonance a true echo of reality.‚Äù\n\n‚ÄìJonathan Rosen, Forward, June 15, 1990\n\n‚ÄúKabbalah is a lustrous and often eloquent work by Houston composer Stewat Wallace and his scholarly librettist Michael Korie. From the opening meditational chant based on the 72-letter name of the Infinite as written in Spain in the 1200s, to the closing measures in which the rabbinical voices echo the notions of reincarnation, this Kabbalah is simple in its structure, but hugely complex in its implications.‚Äù\n\n‚ÄìAnn Holmes, The Houston Chronicle, June 16, 1990\n\n‚ÄúKabbalah concerns souls wandering in the desert, suffering, dying, and then, because they have sinned, undergoing the misfortune of rebirth. The audience is seated on two sides, with the opera between them ‚Äì ten singers unroll a white floor-cloth to represent a dry riverbed. On it they dump grain, struggle, go blind‚Ä¶ at the end, in a fabulous stroke of theatrical poetry, they all tuck themselves in under the cloth and crawl into the earth. If you didn‚Äôt know what ‚Äòdust to dust‚Äô meant before you saw this show, you would know afterward. As a pr√©cis of a couple of millennia in the desert, the piece moved along relatively briskly.

That can‚Äôt be stated too strongly. Long Beach Opera warns its patrons that the production contains nudity, pornography, tobacco smoke, fog and gunshots. If that‚Äôs a problem stay away. If you hold Hollywood and its early icons‚Äìits Charlie Chaplins, Clark Gables, Eva Gardners‚Äìin high moral esteem, stay away. If it will spoil your appreciation of the powerful stillness and affectless emotion in Edward Hopper‚Äôs paintings to consider their creator a violent, drunken, vulgar, suicidal misogynist, you probably don‚Äôt need this. But if you want a notion of one possible direction for American opera into the next millennium, Hopper‚Äôs Wife needs to be your destination. It is not a particularly likable opera and certainly not nice, but it is brave, bold and important. Korie offers exciting images and horribly crude ones side by side; clever rhymes intentionally confuse smut with art‚Ä¶. Hopper‚Äôs Wife is an arresting attempt at the level of music, poetry and theater to grapple with one of the most meaningful issues in art today, namely how, in a postmodern age dominated by popular culture, can high art remain meaningful.‚ÄùPress\n\n‚Äî Mark Swed, The Los Angeles Times, June 16, 1997\n\n‚ÄúHopper‚Äôs Wife‚Ä¶ uses the troubled marriage of painters Edward and Jo Hopper to explore gender conflicts and the struggle between high and low art in contemporary American culture. Abandoning any pretense to biographical accuracy, composer Stewart Wallace and librettist Michael Korie use a peculiar kind of mythic-historic fantasy to heighten the allegorical dimension of Edward Hopper‚Äôs real-life domination of his bitter and frustrated wife‚Ä¶. Jo angrily leaves Edward, fed up with his womanizing and lack of support for her own painting career. She moves to Hollywood where, in the work‚Äôs most dazzling set-piece she transforms herself into another mythically resonant real-life figure: Hedda Hopper, the vindictive gossip columnist who egged on the witch-hunts of the McCarthy era. The quirky conceit broadens the scope of the opera beyond domestic squabbling and into an examination of Edward Hopper‚Äôs struggle to survive as a serious painter in a culture dominated by the crass mechanics of the Hollywood movie industry. With its odd and sophisticated premise, the production makes a case for opera as a genuinely adult art form, one able to confront and decry the current ‚Äòdumbed-down‚Äô state of American Culture.‚Äù\n\n‚Äî Michael Duncan, Art in America, February 1997\n\n‚ÄúHere‚Äôs an American opera that does not stand as the latest feeble rewrite of either Puccini or Alban Berg, by creators who honor (as did Mozart, Verdi, and even Wagner) the notion that great opera is as beholden to the gods of entertainment as to high art, and have invented their own musical language and grammar to prove their point. May their tribe increase.‚Äù\n\n‚Äî Alan Rich, LA Weekly, June 20-26, 1997\n\n‚ÄúWallace and Korie, the team that wrote Harvey Milk, this time imagines an engrossing fantasy meshing real people of the 1940s with fictional lives: artist Edward Hopper, Hollywood columnist Hedda Hopper, actress Eva Gardner‚Ä¶ The singers each delivered showpiece arias, backed by a surprisingly substantial instrumental ensemble of ten. Hopper‚Äôs Wife fills up 90 intermissionless minutes in a musical style of easy but pungent eclecticism.‚Äù\n\n‚Äî Daniel Cariaga, Opera News, October 1997\n\n‚ÄúHopper‚Äôs Wife avoids the plodding chronology of many biographical operas by presenting a quintet of set pieces that focus on character and give each singer the chance to strut their stuff. The imaginative riff on two cultural icons of the mid-20th century made for an entertaining and engaging evening that augurs well for the new-old company‚Äôs role in New York‚Äôs musical life.‚Äù\n\n‚Äî Susan Brodie, Classical Voice North America, May 2016\n\n‚ÄúIt‚Äôs a wild concept that manages to incorporate three outrageously fictional scenes: the suicide of Hopper (a la Norman Maine in ‚ÄúA Star Is Born‚Äù), the murder of Ava by Jo/Hedda, and the epic burning of Hopper works by Jo/Hedda (a la Manderley at the end of Hitchcock‚Äôs ‚ÄúRebecca‚Äù) who feels that works showing her ‚Äúposed like a two-bit stripper‚Äù would damage her moral standing. Fittingly, the 90-minute chamber work closes with an end card (‚ÄúThe End‚Äù) that evokes Looney Tunes‚Ä¶ It has taken Hopper‚Äôs Wife nearly 20 years to journey from California, where it had its premiere, to New York. It may have lost some of the shock value in the meantime, but it has lost none of its ability to draw an audience into its absurdities. And in our current political climate, this tale of reinventing oneself for venal personal ends seems more timely than ever.‚Äù\n\n‚Äî Richard Sasanow, BWW Opera World.com, May 2016\n\nMEDIA\n\nFURTHER READING\n\nLos Angeles Times: ‚ÄúArt, Artifice and Morality‚Äù\n\nLos Angeles Times: ‚Äú‚ÄòHopper‚Äôs Wife‚Äô: Not for the Faint of Art‚Äù\n\nBroadway Opera World: ‚ÄúA Wife for All Seasons‚Äù\n\nHopper‚Äôs Wife Libretto"
