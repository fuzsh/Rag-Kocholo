        "text": "A selective listing by critics of The Times of new or noteworthy opera, classical music and dance events this weekend in the Northeast.\n\nOpera\n\nGLIMMERGLASS OPERA. Every summer opera lovers and the operatically curious go to Cooperstown, N.Y., to enjoy the offerings of the adventurous Glimmerglass Opera festival. It's a long drive from New York City, about four hours, but well worth the trip. The 900-seat Alice Busch Theater is ideal for opera with its large stage, intimate hall, airy ambience and excellent acoustics. This summer as in the past the company offers four new productions, and you can see three of them this weekend. The director Robin Guarino, it is promised, has completely re-imagined the most popular double bill in opera: Mascagni's ''Cavalleria Rusticana'' and Leoncavallo's ''Pagliacci,'' which plays tonight. The works will be presented in the opposite order from the norm, with ''Pagliacci'' first. There will be a common set, designed by John Conklin, and characters from both works will appear onstage together at specific points. The conception is said to be indebted to Pirandello and Fellini. Stewart Robertson conducts. Tomorrow evening offers the opening night of Poulenc's ''Dialogues of the Carmelites,'' sung in an English translation of the French libretto. The production is by the acclaimed director Tazewell Thompson, with Mr. Robertson conducting. On Sunday afternoon comes the composer Mark Adamo's operatic adaptation of Louisa May Alcott's novel ''Little Women'' with a libretto by Mr. Adamo. The work was given its successful premiere in 1998 by the Houston Grand Opera, a production broadcast earlier this year on public television's ''Great Performances'' series. This new production is directed by the imaginative Rhoda Levine. John DeMain conducts. ''Pagliacci/Cavalleria Rusticana,'' tonight at 8 p.m.; ''Dialogues of the Carmelites,'' tomorrow at 8 p.m., ''Little Women,'' Sunday at 2 p.m. Glimmerglass Opera, Alice Busch Theater, Route 80 eight miles north of Cooperstown, N.Y. Single tickets: $26 to $100 (10 percent off for students and 65+; 50 percent off for under 18). Information and tickets: (607) 547-2255 (Anthony Tommasini).\n\nClassical Music\n\nASTON MAGNA FESTIVAL. The early-music scene in the Northeast has long shuttled between New York and Boston, and what better middle ground is there in the summer than the Berkshire Hills? This weekend the Aston Magna Festival offers ''The Concerted Madrigal,'' an evening based on madrigals of love and war from the seventh and eighth books of Monteverdi. The countertenor Jeffrey Gall adds a solo work by Sigismondo d'India, and the program also includes instrumental works by Salomone Rossi and others. Daniel Stepner, a violinist and the artistic director, leads the instrumentalists. Tomorrow night at 6, St. James Church, off Main Street, Great Barrington, Mass., (413) 528-3595 or (800) 875-7156. Tickets: $25 at the door; $22.50 in advance; $20 for students and 65+. The program is also to be presented tonight at 8 at Bard College, Route 9G, Annandale-on-Hudson, N.Y., (845) 758-7425. Tickets: $15; $10 for students and 62+ (James R. Oestreich).\n\nBANG ON A CAN SUMMER INSTITUTE. ''I started the gamelan orchestra just because I thought everybody should have a gamelan in their lives,'' said Evan Ziporyn, the clarinetist and composer, who works and creates and teaches with the quirky new-music collective Bang on a Can. This weekend, the Bang on a Can Summer Institute's gamelan orchestra, which has been rehearsing daily as part of the group's first-ever summer teaching program at the Massachusetts Museum of Contemporary Art, will make its debut in a seasonal (and shorter) version of the marathon for which Bang on a Can has been famous since its inception in 1987. The program includes pieces by Louis Andriessen, Todd Reynolds (another Institute faculty member), the three Bang on a Can founders and artistic directors (Julia Wolfe, David Lang and Michael Gordon), and several works by the summer's composer in residence, Steve Reich. The gamelan will be playing a work with which Bang on a Can has had considerable success: Terry Riley's seminal ''In C.'' Hunter Center at Mass MoCA, North Adams, Mass, (413) 662-2111. Tickets: $20; gallery admission an additional $5 with ticket purchase (Anne Midgette)."
