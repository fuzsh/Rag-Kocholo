        "text": "By providing a structured mentorship program for young composers and librettists who have a passion for the lyric stage, ALT provides a supportive educational environment in which young artists can safely take risks while heightening their theatrical and musical skills under the guidance of professionals from the combined worlds of both theater and music. ALT collaborates with a number of New York City's prestigious non-profit performing arts organizations to provide these young artists with the most diverse and unique training opportunity available in the country. ALT's Composer / Librettist Development Program was launched in August 2007. The program has been designed to provide a unique professional mentorship and training environment where composers and librettists will study with artistic staff from ALT, as well as have the opportunity to observe the artistic processes at some of the country's finest opera and theater companies."
