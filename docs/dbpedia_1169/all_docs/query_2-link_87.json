        "text": "During a talkback session after a performance of X:The Life and Times of Malcolm X at Detroit Opera, the Davises discuss the genesis of the opera with a group of students from Michigan State University.\n\n© Detroit Opera/Austin Richey\n\nDuring a break in their busy schedules, Seattle Opera brought together composer Anthony Davis, librettist Thulani Davis, and story writer Christopher Davis to discuss the genesis of X: The Life and Times of Malcolm X. It was a lively conversation, much like a family reunion, because the Davises are related. As they reminisced on the many milestones that marked the developments of the opera, Anthony, Thulani, and Christopher recalled the people and circumstances that shaped the opera.\n\nSEATTLE OPERA: Thank you for joining us this morning. We’re looking forward to hearing your thoughts about the opera. We’d like to start by asking what sparked your interest in telling Malcolm’s story in the form of an opera?\n\nANTHONY DAVIS: Kip [Christopher Davis] was doing a play called El Hajj Malik, performing as Malcolm X in the play. He spoke to me about the idea of doing Malcolm, doing that story. The autobiography [“The Autobiography of Malcolm X” by Alex Haley] had so many references to music, Kip thought we could tell Malcolm's story through the progression of jazz, let's say from the forties to the sixties, et cetera. I was intrigued that it should be an opera with Malcolm as a tragic hero. I studied a lot of Wagner when I was in school. I also read a lot of Nietzsche and Kierkegaard’s ideas about opera, and that's what got me really interested in opera. I strongly felt that Malcolm was a tragic hero figure whose story would lend itself to being told in opera.\n\nNew York’s Public Theater was one the city’s creative hubs for sparking new and experimental works in ’70s and ’80s, and the Davises were central figures.\n\n© public domain\n\nCHRISTOPHER “KIP” DAVIS: Also at the time, we were all in New York in the late ‘70s and early ’80s, which gave us the opportunity to work together. There was a lot of cross-pollination, across disciplines happening then. Anthony and Thulani had done some work together, combining her poetry and his music. We were all sort of involved in what was happening at The Public Theater, where they had concerts after events. So, we were clued into the possibilities of doing something across disciplines.\n\nAnthony was also really interested in exploring longer forms. In the early ’80s he’d worked extensively with choreographers and was looking for other means of expression. I thought that the story of Malcolm X was almost a classic tragedy, including having the false reconciliation in Act Two followed by the true tragic ending in Act Three. At the time, we would all get together, hang out, and talk about this. It was decided that I would generate the story, Thulani would generate the libretto, and then pass it on to Anthony who would then write the music. Did I get that right, guys?\n\nANTHONY DAVIS: Yeah, that’s about it. Thulani and I were working together. We had done a lot of performances with poetry and music during that period. There's a show we did at The Public Theater with Ntozake Shange and Jessica Hagedorn called, Where the Mississippi Meets the Amazon. It was an extraordinary time. We were working with incredible groups of musicians and poets.\n\nTHULANI DAVIS: I'm not sure this is relevant to writing opera, but one of the things that was extraordinary about putting together Where the Mississippi Meets the Amazon was that everybody could improvise. And who does poetry improvising? But the band was so great, we ended up sort of learning how to improvise and double lines and stuff when the music got hot. That production ran for four weeks. We really go to work together. We [Anthony and I] did one other concert which made me know the opera could work. So, when he asked me about writing the words, I knew that it would work. I had a lot of confidence.\n\nSEATTLE OPERA: At the time when you were creating X, were other operas focusing on real people?\n\nANTHONY DAVIS: Well, there was Satyagraha, [An opera with music by Philip Glass, libretto by Constance DeJong] which was based on Mahatma Gandhi. There was also Einstein on the Beach, which is a very abstract kind of thing. There was The Life and Times of Joseph Stalin that Robert Wilson did. There were pieces like that at the time. These pieces were very abstract. I think one of the advantages of doing stories about real person is that you don't have to deal with the copyright issues like you do with novels. Also, you can create your own stories out of the history.\n\nCHRISTOPHER DAVIS: Yeah, when I created the story of X, I combined several people into composite characters to push the narrative.\n\nANTHONY DAVIS: Like the character of Street. Street is a combination of various people in the autobiography. Focusing on real people is a potent, potent form of storytelling. But since X, I haven't really done any other operas that were based on just one figure. But I think that because of the nature of his story and the tragic nature of his story, I thought it was really an operatic story.\n\nTHULANI DAVIS: Well also, there weren't ten other composers doing black stories, that was for sure. And you have to know that in the autobiography, Malcolm had composite characters in order to conceal the identity of people who were gangsters that he had run around with. That aided us a lot. There were also things that he fudged in the book, which I didn't find out until later when family members came to see me. We got much more of it straight after the fact. When we approached people who knew Malcolm and told them that we were writing an opera about him and parts of life or really about anything, they didn’t trust us immediately. After they saw the work, then, ... oh, people would share their Malcolm X story. I was like, ‘Damn, where were you three years ago?’\n\nANTHONY DAVIS: We had a lot of that. A lot of that.\n\nTHULANI DAVIS: There was a steep learning curve for me after the fact, which was really interesting for me. And most people who knew him—family members and close friends— knew he had fudged certain things in the book, they were kind of okay with us continuing to do that.\n\nThe Autobiography of Malcolm X: As Told to Alex Haley was published in October 1965, nine months after Malcolm X’s assassination. Haley coauthored the autobiography based on a series in-depth interviews conducted over two years.\n\n© public domain\n\nSEATTLE OPERA: Was Alex Haley involved in it at all? Did he see it?\n\nANTHONY DAVIS: Alex Haley. No. A lot was revealed after the fact. Thulani just mentioned people coming up to her saying they knew Malcolm. Our next-door neighbor at Martha's Vineyard, said she dated Malcolm Little in Lansing, Michigan. I didn't know this until, of course, I had already done the opera. Then I started hearing all these stories about playing tennis with Malcolm Little when they were teenagers and stuff like that.\n\nCHRISTOPHER DAVIS: I guess the biggest reveals were our encounters with Betty Shabazz [Malcolm’s widow], who, of course, dismissed us like, ‘Who are you?’ And then suddenly it’s happening at City Opera, and she really wants to know who we are. That was kind of a difficult transition, but we were aided very much by Bill Lynch, Chief of Staff to David Dinkins, who was then Manhattan Borough President. He got us all together in a room and we kind of smoothed things out.\n\nBetty Shabazz was Malcolm X’s widow. The couple married in 1958 and had six children. After Malcolm’s assassination, Shabazz earned a doctorate and served as a professor health science at Medgar Evers College and public speaker.\n\nANTHONY DAVIS: And of course, Beverly Sills...that's one of the great Beverly Sills stories. Beverly Sills meets Betty Shabazz. It was fantastic.\n\nSEATTLE OPERA: How long was the incubation period for X, from the time it was an idea to actually going on stage?\n\nCHRISTOPHER DAVIS: Well, it got on stage in stages. I would say that the first stage readings from its inception was—I don't know—four months.\n\nANTHONY DAVIS: Yeah. I think I started working on it in ’83.\n\nTHULANI DAVIS: I can tell you the dates, because I wrote them down. It took me six months to do the first draft.\n\nANTHONY DAVIS: In ’84 we did the FolkFest workshop in Philadelphia at the American Music Theater Festival. Then in ’85, we did another performance in Philadelphia. That was at the Walnut Street Theatre. And then ’86 we were at City Opera.\n\nTHULANI DAVIS: I wrote down every single one of those dates you're mentioning. I went on my honeymoon in 1981. So what Anthony's saying is when we started workshopping in ’83.\n\nSEATTLE OPERA: It seems like much of the opera was written at Martha’s Vineyard.\n\nANTHONY DAVIS: Some of it was, yeah. Well, I wrote some of the opera there. Other parts were created in various places. I wrote parts of it in Berkeley, California, actually. A friend of mine gave me her house while she was away so I could just write music. That was a very interesting period, because I was able to get together with composers Paul Drescher and John Adams. We would meet and talk about our projects.\n\nCHRISTOPHER DAVIS: I wrote the story mostly at a friend's place in Lake Forest, Illinois. She was working upstairs finishing her dissertation, and I was working downstairs on the story.\n\nTHULANI DAVIS: I wrote the entire libretto in Brooklyn—in Fort Greene. I don’t think I worked in other places.\n\nANTHONY DAVIS: Most of time I was in Manhattan. I was living at Manhattan Plaza, which is on 43rd Street and Ninth Avenue.\n\nTHULANI DAVIS: Yeah. After I would send a scene or two, we had these meetings in diners around Manhattan Plaza.\n\nCHRISTOPHER DAVIS: And then in my studio apartment in The Village, until the neighbors would knock on the door because we were laughing too loud.\n\nTHULANI DAVIS: I don't remember going to your place a lot. I think I only ever went there once.\n\nSEATTLE OPERA: After almost 40 years, why do you think there is renewed interest in X?\n\nCHRISTOPHER DAVIS: Well, people caught up to us.\n\nANTHONY DAVIS: George Floyd happened. The reckoning that many opera companies and art institutions had with dealing with race and racism brought a new awareness to it. There were a lot of close calls, with a lot of interest in X over the years with different companies, but it never quite happened. I think many events, including the rise of Black Lives Matter and Malcolm X’s preeminence as a leader and a foreshadower for Black Lives Matter, became a kind of a critical mass that sparked interest. Also, Yuval Sharon, who's the director of Detroit Opera, really, really helped put together the companies that would eventually be involved in the project.\n\nSoon after the murder of George Floyd in 2020, three artists—Cadex Herrera, Greta McLain, and Xena Goldman—painted this mural at the murder site located on the corner of East 33rd and Chicago Ave in Minneapolis.\n\n© Twin Cities Pioneer Press\n\nTHULANI DAVIS: My expression for it is: ‘George Floyd is mighty.’ But I think there were a lot of hesitancies in the past because we had improvisers in the orchestra, which no one at City Opera in the orchestra enjoyed. I think there were plenty of singers at the time to do it, but opera companies did not have Black singers in their companies. When we went to Chicago, there was one Black singer in that company. At City Opera there might have been one. They considered hiring one of our singers after the opera. A lot of people were telling us, well, it would be so expensive for them to get the singers for it. There was lots of stodginess that got in their way. I guess they continued doing things the same way. They could not envision doing this opera with mostly Black singers, a couple of Black dancers, and ten improvisers in the orchestra.\n\nCHRISTOPHER DAVIS: I think one of the deterrents also was 9/11. After 9/11 it was not an appropriate time to tell a story that is built on the conversion to Islam as a triumphant moment. That’s a hard sell. It's taken George Floyd to push that off to the side and get us to move on.\n\nTHULANI DAVIS: I wanted to say that at that time City Opera didn't know how to engage with the public. In other words, we had to sit down and invent interactions with the community. We started at the Schomburg Library, where I had a part-time job. So, we did a piece of it there. We did a piece of it at the Guggenheim. We had to really sit down and invent all of that.\n\nANTHONY DAVIS: Yeah, it was much like a political campaign. It’s very, very interesting what we did.\n\nCHRISTOPHER DAVIS: That's why it was important to have Bill Lynch and David Dinkins as enthusiastic supporters of the project.\n\nANTHONY DAVIS: David arranged the meeting with Beverly Sills and Betty Shabazz and us, where Betty Shabazz finally endorsed the opera.\n\nTHULANI DAVIS: Well, after torturing me. I had to go see her first before anything, and she gave me a hard time. I was just her. Her first question was: ‘Who do you think you are?’\n\nCHRISTOPHER DAVIS: That's right. And when the three of us went to meet in her office, she turned to me and said, ‘Are you the lawyer?’\n\nANTHONY DAVIS: The irony was that X was the most popular modern opera ever produced at City Opera in its history. There were buses from Harlem coming to the opera. I mean, it was pretty extraordinary.\n\nCHRISTOPHER DAVIS: It just wasn't their subscribers.\n\nANTHONY DAVIS: But it showed a new model of what contemporary opera could do to bring in a new audience, whether they wanted to really deal with the idea that there was a new audience that's eager to see something like X.\n\nNew York City Opera’s presented X: The Life and Times of Malcolm X in 1986. The production starred Ben Holt (center) in the title role.\n\n© New York Times/Carol Rosegg\n\nTHULANI DAVIS: And they had tickets for seven bucks! They had to add shows because people bought all the seven dollars tickets.\n\nSEATTLE OPERA: During the opera’s development—especially while you were workshopping it—did you make any major revisions. Were there areas that were changed or cut?\n\nANTHONY DAVIS: The workshop process was amazing. Working with Rhoda Levine [opera director, choreographer] was really amazing. Rhoda was a big part of X. She was, in effect, our kind of dramaturge, because of all her experience in opera and doing so many contemporary operas, like Kaiser from Atlantis and the other operas she was associated with. It was part of my learning curve, how to do an opera. I remember her staging Louise’s scene. There was an instrumental interlude that happened before Louise sings. Rhoda asked me, ‘What is Louise doing during the interlude?’ We ended up writing more words for the scene. Thulani wrote a recitative that sets up the scene as a way to explain where she is and how she's feeling before she sings her aria. That made it ten times more effective than it was originally. There were lots of examples of that. I learned about crafting opera while we created X—what goes into an opera, how the drama works with the music. I think that that was important. I think particularly for a composer doing his first opera, workshops are vital for that.\n\nCHRISTOPHER DAVIS: And with your background as an improviser, you were flexible in terms of changing things up. For instance, originally Street and Elijah weren't...those roles weren't doubled. Street was originally a baritone or a bass-baritone.\n\nANTHONY DAVIS: Malcolm is conceived as a high baritone.\n\nCHRISTOPHER DAVIS: It was in response to the talent that we found that we rewrote it.\n\nANTHONY DAVIS: Avery Brooks was originally Street in the first workshop. He was so charismatic as Street. He came up to me and said, ‘Well, Tony, could I play Malcolm?’ I said, ‘Okay.’ So, I had Avery play Malcolm, and I had to find a new Street. We were auditioning for Elijah Muhammad. Thomas Young came to sing. He sang Gounod's Faust and an aria from Daughter of the Regiment. I said, ‘Okay, you're Elijah Muhammad, no question.’\n\nThen he said, he was singing in the jazz club in my building. I went to the gig with Kip. He did the most amazing version of “There’s a Boat Dat’s Leavin’ Soon.” It was unbelievable. Then he did Strayhorn and Ellington songs, et cetera. And I said, ‘Well, he’s Street, too.’ I said to Kip, ‘We're going to have Street and Elijah Muhammad played by the same person.’\n\nTHULANI DAVIS: While we were rehearsing for a workshop, there was a singer playing Elijah who wanted to sing while standing on a ladder. He wanted to be higher than the other singers. His only frame of reference was playing the roles of kings. We were like, ‘Yeah, no. You're going to stand on the same level as everybody else.’ His experience up to that point was nothing like Street or Elijah or Malcolm. He’d not played people who hustled on a street corner in Harlem. They, all of the singers, were, in a sense, being asked to play roles like nothing they had ever played before. We had to show them everything, from how people walk across the stage to the formation and posture of the Fruit of Islam.\n\nIn Act III of the opera, Malcolm breaks from the Nation of Islam then makes a transformative pilgrimage to Mecca where he converts to orthodox Muslim and adopts the new name El-Hajj Malik El-Shabazz.\n\n© Detroit Opera\n\nThen there was the prayer scene in Mecca. I was warned about it from the first day I wrote that scene. I was called by a person to whom I described the scene. He said, ‘What are you doing?’ I said, ‘I'm writing this opera and I'm writing the Mecca scene.’ And he was like, ‘Oh God, you cannot depict Mecca. It's a violation of the tenants of Islam. You cannot show Mecca.’ I was like, ‘The scene will show people circling the Black Rock.’ He was like, ‘No, they'll bomb the place.’ And I was like, ‘Oh, okay. Good to know.’\n\nANTHONY DAVIS: Also, you can't set any part of the Quran except the morning prayer. That’s the other thing.\n\nTHULANI DAVIS: I got a prayer book and set a morning prayer scene. We were somewhat terrorized up until it opened about how that was going to work. We had six Islamic newspapers at the opening. They thought it was very respectful. When we did it in Detroit last spring, several people came up to me who had come from New York to see it. They wanted to know if this was the first time Islamic prayers have ever been done in an opera. And I said, ‘I have no idea. But I wouldn't be surprised.’ The scene really hits people as unusual. Because it's so beautiful, reviewers tend to mention it quite often.\n\nCHRISTOPHER DAVIS: I remember we were doing a workshop in BAM [The Brooklyn Academy of Music] in Brooklyn. Avery Brooks went to lunch and found somebody from the Fruit of Islam in full regalia and brought him to the rehearsal.\n\nTHULANI DAVIS: Well, we were in the perfect neighborhood for that to happen, yeah.\n\nSEATTLE OPERA: What would you all like our audiences to know, or take away from X: The Life and Times of Malcolm X?\n\nANTHONY DAVIS: Well, I think an understanding that the fact that culture and history are tied together. Culture, history, politics, and music are interwoven. Also, Blackness comes in different forms of representation. I mean, this is not Porgy and Bess. No, this is not Porgy and Bess. Back in the ’80s when we were creating X, we literally had to take Porgy and Bess out of the performers.\n\nCHRISTOPHER DAVIS: And that we are more than love stories. We're bigger than love stories.\n\nSEATTLE OPERA: Do you consider this story a biographical?\n\nCHRISTOPHER DAVIS: No.\n\nANTHONY DAVIS: No, I hate that.\n\nCHRISTOPHER DAVIS: That’s what Spike Lee did. When you say biography, it sounds like a made-for-TV series or something. I think that the structure we have makes this a story of transformation. I don't think of it as a straightforward biography.\n\nANTHONY DAVIS: It's a journey in terms of ideas, how ideas formed, and the pathways of how to be a Black man.\n\nTHULANI DAVIS: When Malcolm asks, ‘What it’s like to be God of an empty man like me?’ that’s a universal human experience. It's not political. It's not something you could say in a biopic. It’s tapping into feelings of desperation, isolation. We've all had moments like that. That’s the power opera can bring.\n\nAt the Detroit performance, grown men cried. They were moved by Malcolm’s first aria where he sings about his mother. There is something about what Anthony was saying about exploring Black manhood and the emotional arena of Black manhood. People don’t talk publicly or to each other, necessarily, about those things.\n\nSEATTLE OPERA: While we’re thinking about manhood and masculinity, why did you voice Malcolm as a baritone? Footage of Malcolm’s speeches show that his voice was more of a high baritone.\n\nANTHONY DAVIS: Not really. Elijah’s voice is definitely a tenor. Also in Black music, the romantic hero is the baritone. It’s Billy Eckstine. When you think of singers from all the way from ’30s or ’40s, et cetera, it’s the baritone voice. It’s not the tenor voice so much. The tenor voice is the trickster.\n\nCHRISTOPHER DAVIS: Yeah, It’s Cab Calloway.\n\nTHULANI DAVIS: Or the occasional Johnny Mathis. The baritone thing seemed more like what we had always heard in those parts, I guess I would say.\n\nCHRISTOPHER DAVIS: And there are a lot of male duets, so we wanted to have voices on either side of it. I've seen some stuff recently where the voices are in the same range, and it gets very confusing.\n\nSEATTLE OPERA: This has been a wonderful conversation. Thank you so much for sharing your stories about the creation of X with us. We really appreciate it, and we know our audience will enjoy reading this interview. Thank you.\n\nX: The Life and Times of Malcolm X runs Febuary 4-March 9, 2024 at McCaw Hall. Tickets and info at seattleopera.org/x.\n\n© Kenneth Kellogg\n\nBass Kenneth Kellogg, who recently gave a breakout performance as Fafner in our production of Dan Rheingold in August, discusses his upcoming portrayal of Malcolm X in this conversation with Seattle Opera. Kenneth talks about his admiration for the human rights leader, the revival of Anthony Davis’s X: The Life and Times of Malcolm X, and how he’s preparing for the role.\n\n© Philip Newton/Seattle Opera\n\nSEATTLE OPERA: The revival X: The Life and Times of Malcolm X was announced more than two years ago—around the time that you were performing in Blue at Seattle Opera. What compelled you to pursue the title role?\n\nKENNETH KELLOGG: I was aware that work was beginning on the production. I knew the production was being done at Detroit, and, actually, I was supposed to sing the role in the Omaha production. But I had to backout of that performance because I was committed to Blue, which was going to take place at the same time. It just so happened that I was doing a radio interview at Classical KING for Blue, when Quinton Morris asked if there were any roles that I was looking forward to singing. I had just finished rereading The Autobiography of Malcolm X. So, Malcolm X was heavy on my mind because I’d been reflecting on what he stood for. So, I answered, ‘Malcolm X.’\n\nI believe Christina Scheppelmann [Seattle Opera General Director] heard the interview. The next morning, she asked if I wanted to do Malcolm X. At that time, I was not aware of the Seattle production. But I replied, ‘Yes, absolutely.’ I hadn’t seen the score and was only briefly familiar with music. I just knew that I wanted to perform Malcolm X.\n\nSEATTLE OPERA: To you, what does Malcolm X stand for?\n\nKENNETH KELLOGG: Malcolm X is a very divisive figure in American culture, American politics, American ideology. In my eyes, Malcolm is a product of America. The racism that happened during his time, the atrocities that happened to his life, made him. He was a mirror of American society. I think he’s divisive because it’s difficult to look at your reflection. It’s difficult for us [Americans] to admit, ‘Okay, maybe Malcolm’s right.’ I believe we’re seeing the fruits of that denial today. Malcolm, and a lot of what he stood for, is very valid today, in many iterations.\n\nFor me, Malcolm is that voice of reason that we didn’t listen to and we’re having to reface a lot of those things today. Had we listened and had we confronted these atrocities then, when he pointed them out to us, I don't think we would be in this situation we have with Black Lives Matter now. I don’t think it would be as drastic.\n\nSEATTLE OPERA: Do you think the rise in stories that reflect BIPOC narratives is sustainable? George Floyd was murdered nearly four years ago.\n\nKENNETH KELLOGG: I think it must be sustained. For opera, and the arts in general, from a purely business, economical, perspective, to sustain ourselves, the arts industry must expand its repertoire and expand its reach to more communities. We must speak to diverse audiences.\n\nAfter the reckoning of George Floyd, every opera company quickly put out statements supporting diversity. All cultural organizations, every non-profit, every corporation…everyone started thinking about race through the lens of what happened to George Floyd.\n\nIn particular, opera companies looked at the stories they were telling. They discovered that among the traditional repertoire, there weren't many diverse stories. The operas that did depict Black life were stereotypical—derogatory and told from perspectives that weren’t our own. We want to tell our own stories. We want to be seen and respected. Black artists became more vocal in calling for diversity. The COVID shutdown and the halt in productions required us to become individually creative and empowered our activism within the field. We raised our voices even louder. Opera companies started to listen. I think, they felt the pressure. I'm not even going to say they listened, but they felt the pressure to tell these stories.\n\nAs a result, new commissions were granted, and companies searched for what was already out there. X had a resurgence after not being performed since 1986.\n\nMoving forward, I think we have to be mindful of what we put on stage. I’m more than elated to see Black stories being told, but we have to look at the big picture. The stories that have been green lit, I fear will have an opposite effect of what we truly want. We’ve pulled from African American history, slavery specifically. While these stories give opportunity and tell stories of Black people, it further isolates Black artists who can only tell this story. You can’t hire any other ethnicity to tell those stories. I think that is where companies have misunderstood the call for diversity. For me, setting La bohème in a historically Black neighborhood with Black aesthetics, i.e. costumes, set design, hair, and makeup, does more for the call for diversity than investing in Black trauma.\n\nSEATTLE OPERA: How are you preparing for the role of Malcolm X. His persona is so well known.\n\nKENNETH KELLOGG: I’m a fan of Malcolm X, I’ll just say that. I’m a fan. Even before the opera was in the works, I would watch YouTube clips, and would rewatch Spike Lee’s, Malcolm X. The film is one of my favorites. I can watch it over and over. And like I said, I’ve read the autobiography several times. So, the preparation was already there.\n\nBut how do I prepare to play him? I am not going to try to take on his persona. I can’t. I concentrate on his message and what he stood for. I trust that the meaning of his life is in the score and the libretto. I trust the composer and the librettist.\n\nI also think about how his message resonates in my life and my thinking. I think about what Malcolm’s message means for today’s audiences. I try to carry those ideals into how I prepare for the role. It affects how I sing. It affects how I walk. It affects all those things, just subconsciously.\n\nAfter watching the protests of the Black Lives Matter movement, I wrote a post a about our civil rights leaders—Martin Luther King and Malcolm X, specifically. At the time I wrote the post, I was really, really angry. I believe Black people have given the best of our community to America. We’ve given everything. And in response, America has murdered our greatest potential.\n\nI often wonder what Malcolm could have done hadn’t he had to fight for civil rights. He was brilliant. Martin was brilliant. These were brilliant, smart men. I think about what contributions to life and society, they might have made, if they hadn’t exhausted themselves and sacrificed themselves for this country’s inequities. These questions haunt me.\n\nSEATTLE OPERA: It’s something to ponder. Can you imagine Malcolm and Martin as senior citizens?\n\nKENNETH KELLOGG: I would love to see that. Just imagine 75 years of contributing to America, to the world, to life. I think things would be very different.\n\nSEATTLE OPERA: If you had the opportunity to sit down with someone who doesn’t know Malcolm X as well as you, what would you tell them?\n\nKENNETH KELLOGG: I would say, Malcolm was a mirror for us [America]. I would say that he had no problem looking in the mirror. He was a very steadfast, a very faithful person. However, he could admit his wrongdoings. It’s not lost on me that when he found out that the foundation of his faith in Elijah Muhammad was broken, that he started thinking for himself. It was a difficult choice. A change like that takes a very powerful, insightful person—a person of principle, a person of heart.\n\nI think I said it earlier, Malcolm is a product of America. He is as American and as apple pie to me…The good and bad.\n\nI would say to someone who doesn’t know much about Malcolm that the reason he’s vilified is that they only know a snapshot of his life. I would challenge that person look at the entirety of his life. Life is a series of causes and effects. Once Malcolm realized that he needed to change, he had no problem evolving and growing. He grew beyond America and took on the world for the sake of his cause.\n\nX: The Life and Times of Malcolm X runs Febuary 4-March 9, 2024 at McCaw Hall. Tickets and info at seattleopera.org/x.\n\nSeattle Opera:\n\nYou were just named Seattle Opera’s Artistic Ambassador for the 2024/25 season. How are you envisioning this role as you prepare to step into it?\n\nKenneth Kellogg:\n\nThe first thing this new role makes me think of is my elementary school teacher. As a young person, I could always see how much she loved music—it was infectious. It impacted me as a kid, which led me on a path first to enjoying music, and then to music taking over my life.\n\nI think of my role as Artistic Ambassador as an extension of that. Music has been a blessing to my life in so many ways: it’s what I think of day and night, it helps me provide for my family, it’s taken me to worlds that I never thought possible. I just hope I can exude the same infectious spirit for music and art that my teacher did for me. Seattle Opera:\n\nWhat do you hope to accomplish in your time as Artistic Ambassador? What are your dreams for the role?\n\nKenneth Kellogg:\n\nI always joke that opera, as an art form, needs a PR person. Every company has their own idea about what opera is, and everyone’s spread across the world doing their own thing. So the idea of what opera is is diluted, and we miss the big picture of what opera means and what it can be for our lives.\n\nSo I kind of want to be that PR person. Ultimately, it’s our job to show people what makes opera special, to introduce them to the joys it can bring. This is one of the things I hope to be able to share with audiences in Seattle and around the world.\n\nKenneth Kellogg as Malcolm X in X: The Life and Times of Malcolm X. © Sunny Martini.\n\nSeattle Opera:\n\nWhat are some ways that opera can reach people who have not experienced the art form before? Is there a way into this tradition, which some might find daunting?\n\nKenneth Kellogg:\n\nIt begins with how we talk about opera and what stories are being told. Most people who haven’t been to the opera before come for the first time either because of a personal invitation from someone who’s inside of opera or because they’re attracted to a particular story that hasn’t been on the opera stage before. And oftentimes the reaction I hear from these audience members is “Wow, I didn’t know that that was what opera is like.” Getting over that hurdle is the toughest part. But I find once people are there and they’ve experienced something they can relate to, they often want to come back.\n\nSeattle Opera:\n\nWhat are some steps that opera companies can take to help remove that hurdle?\n\nKenneth Kellogg:\n\nFor me, it all comes down to the storytelling. You have to let people know that opera is relevant to them, and show them why it’s relevant. Many of the responses I heard to X: The Life and Times of Malcolm X had to do with how meaningful it was for audience members to see themselves or their culture represented on stage. That speaks to the power we have as artists to portray things that really matter to people. Maybe that means expanding the repertoire, maybe it means talking about the current repertoire in different ways. Either way, we have to make opera matter to people rather than expecting people to do that work themselves. We have to be imaginative. We have to create things that matter.\n\nKenneth Kellogg as The Father along with Briana Hunter as The Mother in Blue. © Philip Newton.\n\nSeattle Opera:\n\nIn what ways do you think Seattle Opera could be doing those things better?\n\nKenneth Kellogg:\n\nThe times that I’ve been here, I think Seattle has done a great job at it. But one thing I see at every company is that when they choose to do a show that’s outside of their norm—and typically it’s a Black show—you’ll notice the extra effort the company puts in to reach a broader audience. That effort needs to be made for every show, not just the ones that are outside of our comfort zone.\n\nSeattle Opera:\n\nWhat do you envision for the future for opera as an art form? Where would you like to see opera ten years from now?\n\nKenneth Kellogg:\n\nOpera has the power to be a truly community-based art form—a place where people can see themselves represented in a larger-than-life space, feel comfortable, and feel welcomed. When I visited with some of the incarcerated people at the Monroe Correctional Complex in February, and sang some excerpts from X, the overwhelming response I heard was “I’ve never seen a Black opera singer in here before.” One man told me he wished I had spoken more about Malcolm X’s journey through Islam, because he himself is a Sunni Muslim and wanted to learn more about Malcolm X’s experience.\n\nMaking opera matter on that level, with every production we mount, will connect us to the humanity of our community. And it’s possible even with the most traditional productions.\n\nKenneth Kellogg as Fafner in Das Rheingold. © Philip Newton.\n\nSeattle Opera:\n\nSpeaking of more traditional repertoire, what balance do you think opera companies should strike between presenting older, canonical works and works that are being written now? And is there a way for those two things not to be seen as in opposition to one another?\n\nKenneth Kellogg:\n\nI think it’s too easy to put new works on a pedestal as the new thing that’s going to save the industry. A new piece is a clean slate that you can talk about in many ways because it doesn’t have the expectation that comes with hundreds of years of history. So, it can be easier to get the creative juices flowing when talking about something new. But I think we need to find a way to achieve that same fresh approach to the canon. We need to think about existing works in new ways and see them as fresh and new.\n\nThat means talking about stories in relatable ways, with current terminology. It means talking about current singers, not just the great ones who lived in the past. That’s how we bridge the gap between the existing repertoire and new works: talk about the canonic operas in new ways and don’t leave them stuck in history.\n\nSeattle Opera:\n\nDoes that also mean presenting these works in new ways on stage?\n\nKenneth Kellogg:\n\nPerhaps, but I don’t think there needs to be a radical change of context. When I say a production should be updated, I mean we need to pay attention to the singers we cast, what the wigs look like, what the costuming looks like, what the sets looks like. La bohème doesn’t have to be in space to be updated. But there are ways you can bring the sets, costumes, and the look of an opera in line with what we might wear today on the street, in a way that makes the story more recognizable to a modern audience.\n\nUltimately, one of the most important questions an opera company can ask itself is “why does this piece matter to my audience? What’s going on in our community that this opera can speak to?” Answering that question means being active in your community so that you know what is going on in people’s lives and how to speak to those issues.\n\nKenneth Kellogg as Malcolm X in X: The Life and Times of Malcolm X. © Philip Newton.\n\nSeattle Opera:\n\nI have one last question for you: our audiences have seen you now in multiple roles, including as Malcolm X, Fafner in Das Rheingold, and The Father in Blue. What do you want our audiences to know about you beyond the stage?\n\nKenneth Kellogg:\n\nI love life and I love connecting dots. I am a very empathetic person. I’m quiet, but observant, and I am really interested in connecting the dots of our lives. I’m a big believer that everything has a purpose and everything serves everything else. There’s nothing in life that exists unto itself.\n\nFor me, art is the connective tissue of that all. Art has the power to connect the unseeable, and I try to bring that passion and belief in life to what I do as an artist.\n\nSeattle Opera:\n\nIs there art that resonates for you particularly strongly outside of opera?\n\nKenneth Kellogg:\n\nI’m a visual artist. I do a lot of portraits and drawing.\n\nSeattle Opera:\n\nDo you have any favorite visual artists?\n\nKenneth Kellogg:\n\nKadir Nelson, who does portraits. He’s one of my favorite artists.\n\nSeattle Opera:\n\nThank you, Kenneth. We look forward to getting to know you better as our new Artistic Ambassador!\n\nJames Robinson is Seattle Opera’s next General and Artistic Director, beginning September 4, 2024.

It’s in the city’s DNA, and I’m honored to be able to build on that rich tradition. I can’t wait to get to work creating art with and for the passionate audiences that have made Seattle Opera into the company it is today.\n\nAnd Seattle is a spectacularly beautiful city. It’s a dynamic city—a growing and youthful city. I can’t wait to be a full-time member of the community.\n\nSeattle Opera: How would you deﬁne your approach to artistic excellence?\n\nJames Robinson: Artistic excellence starts with getting the best people in place for their respective roles. Fortunately, in my thirty-plus years in this business, I’ve worked at the ﬁnest opera companies with many of the best conductors, designers, singers, and others. My number one goal is to maintain the high artistic standards Seattle Opera already has and add my experiences to that.\n\nSeattle Opera: You’ve built your career, in part, on creating new works and taking on newer works. Tell us about your philosophy on commissioning new work.\n\nJames Robinson: When I started at Opera Theatre of Saint Louis, I was passionate about raising the proﬁle of the company. We began by looking at adventurous programming: creating new operas and doing productions of newer works that may have been neglected. We started the New Works, Bold Voices initiative to produce completely new works likes Terence Blanchard’s Fire Shut Up in My Bones and to take another look at contemporary works that were ready for a second look. Tobias Picker’s Emmeline was one of those pieces, as were a revised and expanded version of Huang Ruo’s An American Soldier and a new version of Ricky Ian Gordon’s The Grapes of Wrath, among many others.\n\nWe developed the New Works, Bold Voices program in such a way to support creators who could embark on their ﬁrst operas and to give them the leeway to write the stories they wanted to write. It was important to lay the groundwork with our local communities as the operas were being developed so just so they had some insights into the process, but also to generate enthusiasm. Lately, we have been working with community members to identify stories that they wanted to see on stage. That was an offshoot of New Works, Bold Voices called the New Works Collective. As I always say: Like politics, all arts are local. So, it’s vital to include the community during the development process on many levels.\n\nSeattle Opera: Why is it important to create new operas?\n\nJames Robinson: All operas were new at one point! I’d like to think that we’re not just in business of historic preservation. New works are vital to the art form in general and incredibly important to the development of audiences.\n\nSeattle Opera: Then how do you balance the old with the new?\n\nJames Robinson: Familiarity breeds familiarity. Meaning audiences love the classics and they come back to what they know and admire, and there’s nothing wrong with that. I love them too. But I don’t think you can build an entire season with the traditional repertoire. You’d exhaust that rep really fast! Nevertheless, for many people those pieces are the entry points to opera. But it’s also a fact that new works bring in new people. You can’t ignore that new pieces can sell incredibly well. I’ve seen them outpace standard rep on many occasions at the box ofﬁce. Balancing the traditional with the new must be approached strategically. And we must realize that one size doesn’t ﬁt most. We have to offer many types of experiences.\n\nSeattle Opera: Among the traditional repertoire, what are some of your favorites?\n\nJames Robinson: Where to start? I’m a huge Handel fan and consider Julius Caesar one of the greatest operas ever written. Madama Butterﬂy and La bohème still go right to my heart. Tristan is a personal favorite, especially act three. I think The Marriage of Figaro is an opera I can’t live without.\n\nSeattle Opera: What would you say are opera’s biggest challenges?\n\nJames Robinson: I say this jokingly: Opera was invented in 1607; in 1608, opera was in crisis. Opera has always faced challenges, but it has soldiered on. More than that, it has continued to transform itself over the centuries and has always found new voices. Coming out of the pandemic, our largest task is just getting people to come back to the opera house. Opera isn’t an experience you can get on Netﬂix. It’s our job to remind people of the great time they’ll experience in the opera house. We must create buzz about every single project that’s done. But look, opera isn’t the only industry facing this dilemma. Symphony orchestras and theatre companies are struggling a bit, too. The movie industry and other forms of entertainment are going through the same thing.\n\nSeattle Opera: On the opposite side of that coin, what excites you about opera’s future?\n\nJames Robinson: My goodness, live opera is one of the most spectacular experiences anyone can have! The great singing, the great music, the great stories all working together to make great LIVE performances. There is nothing like it.\n\nSeattle Opera: What do you like to do when you’re not thinking about opera?\n\nJames Robinson: I’m an avid outdoor person. To stay sane, I work out at Orange Theory and I’m glad to see there is an Orange Theory studio near the Opera Center! I’m also a runner. I’m big into cooking. My husband I are both cooks, and my signature dish is veal osso buco. I also make a mean Moroccan tagine.\n\nI’m also a classic movie buff. Two of my favorites are A Place in the Sun and All About Eve. But now that I’m thinking about it, there are twelve other ﬁlms that I could add to that list. Every Hitchcock ﬁlm! And I like different types of music—everything from Wagner to Sarah Vaughan to Nirvana. My new obsession is the singer Samara Joy.\n\nSeattle Opera: What’s the last piece of music you added to your play list?\n\nJames Robinson: Philip Glass’s Piano Etudes, performed by the composer. I read in The New York Times that Glass wrote the etudes to improve his own piano skills. At the same time, I was at Opera Theatre of Saint Louis directing Glass’s Galileo Galilei. Philip Glass ﬁlled my head, and I played the recording of the etudes over and over.\n\nSeattle Opera: This is a tough question. What would you say is your favorite opera?\n\nJames Robinson: I hope this will not scare folks, but I just love Stravinsky’s The Rake’s Progress. I think it’s one of the most beautiful scores ever written and the moral fable it’s based on is so touching. It’s funny, poignant, and harrowing. It also has a perfect libretto. I think people think of Stravinsky still as a thorny modernist, but this opera has such heart and emotion."
