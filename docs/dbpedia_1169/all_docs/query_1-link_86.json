        "text": "The family was brought up to respect Nature and many holidays were spent on camping adventures. Donna to this day is a devout lover of Nature and feels very pleased and grounded when out in and enjoying Nature.\n\nDonna also loved and excelled in Maths, English, Creative Writing, Acting, and Choreography. She wrote, directed, and choreographed many shows for her schools. At one point she had thought about also trying to train to be an Olympian, but then fell totally in love with Dance after her mother enrolled her in weekly Ballet classes. Little to be known then that this would change the course of her life!\n\nDonna leaping during a Kodak photo shoot.\n\nDonna with her brothers, little sister yet to arrive.\n\nFormative Dance Training\n\nHer formative dance training was received on full scholarship at the prestigious Botsford School in Rochester, New York founded by dance visionary Enid Knapp Botsford, who had trained and danced with Anna Pavlova. (Please visit https://www.facebook.com/The-Enid-BotsfordLegacy-940786495957359/?ref=hl) The comprehensive ten-year programme she completed included training and mentoring from an internationally renowned staff including Patricia Wilde, Jurgen Schneider, Sir Anton Dolin, George Zoritch, Kathleen Crofton, David Gayle, Miguel Lopez, Woytek Lowski, Lorenzo Monreal, The Andaházy’s, and Fernando Bujones amongst many other dance luminaries.\n\nShe trained six-days-per- week intensively in Classical Ballet Technique, Pointe Work, Variations and Repertoire, Character Dance, Horton Technique, Graham Technique, Drama, Dalcroze Eurythmics, Mensendieck Therapy, Ballet mime, Performance Technique, Folk Dance, Partnering and advanced Ballroom Dance with the esteemed Claire Leonard. There were also guests from the Martha Graham Company (Enid has been a colleague of Martha's), American Ballet Theatre, Boston Ballet, Joyce Trisler Company, and the Bottom of the Bucket Dance Company directed by Garth Fagan, and others. The school was a satellite school for American Ballet Theatre under the direction first of Lucia Chase and then later Michael\n\nBaryshnikov.\n\nDonna as a young dancer modelling for Eastman Kodak Co.\n\nExterior shot of the purpose built Botsford Dance School in Rochester, NY. One of only two purpose-built Dance Schools in the US at the time.\n\nInterior shot showing the large light filled unconventional and modern Dance Studio\n\nFamous dancer and dance artist Leon Danielian, then Director of the School of American Ballet Theatre, with Enid Botsford- Orcutt and her beloved husband Brent G. Orcutt.\n\nPress from when Sir Anton Dolin taught the students and set his \"Pas de Quatre\" on the dancers. Donna was cast as Carlotta Grisi.\n\nBrent and Enid with Boston Ballet Founder and then Director E. Virginia Williams\n\nHer school also had a partnership with The Boston Ballet under the direction of E. Virginia Williams. There were performances for the students with these companies, with guest artists from these companies, and coaching with guests from these companies all throughout Donna's training. The Botsford School also gave performances at their own studio theatre, three to four times per year. The students also performed at local schools, institutions, and organisations on a regular basis. These formative years provided her with excellence on all levels and exposure to brilliance and she is forever grateful to Enid Knapp and her husband Brent G Orcutt for their generosity and for their vision.\n\nDonna’s extensive dance training continued in New York City with scholarships to the Melissa Hayden Dance Studio and the David Howard Studio where she had the privilege to study and be mentored under the excellent tutelage of David Howard, Marjorie Mussman, Wilhelm Burman, Bobby Blankshine, Diana Cartier, and Melissa Hayden.\n\nShe had first danced professionally as a child with the Festival Ballet of New York, under the direction of famed British teacher and Dance artist Miss Kathleen Crofton and a few years later with the Boston Ballet under the direction of E. Virginia Williams. She has her first contract, copies of her shoe allowance, posters, and programmes in a tattered old scrapbook that she holds dear.\n\nShe was a very ferocious mouse and Miss Crofton praised her tenacity and force!\n\n“Nutcracker” with the Festival Ballet of NY.\n\nIn \"Giselle\" as a young dancer with partner Kennet Oberly, then of the Stuttgart Ballet, in a Botsford Annual Performance directed by David Gayle, MBE.\n\nLater on\n\nShe later joined the Cleveland Ballet at the peak of its success, under the direction of Denis Nahat and Ian \"Ernie\" Horvath, and performed a diverse repertoire which included beautiful works by George Balanchine, Ian Horvath, Dennis Nahat, Louis Falco, and Agnes De Mille. Many of her colleagues from that era are still close friends and collaborators, and have been guest teachers for Ballet4life, and she has been invited to work with them on their projects.\n\nFrom a Cleveland Ballet's annual Brochure, Horvath's piece \"Laura's Women\" shot by Avedon\n\nCompany photo shoot\n\nPlaying around in the Cleveland Ballet studio\n\nFreelance Professional Experience\n\nDonna went on to dance with many independent choreographers such as Diane Coburn Brüning of www.chamberdance.org. Diane cast her as Hester Prynne in her first professional ballet “The Scarlet Letter.” Donna also was a frequent guest artist with the Glimmerglass Opera under the direction of Paul Kellogg. With the Glimmerglass Opera, she was a featured dancer in \"The Bartered Bride, \" \"Eugene Onegin,\" \"The Mighty Casey,\" and \"Pirates of Penzance\" with direction and choreography by Virginia Thatcher, Jack Eddleman, Stephanie Hall, and Rhoda Levine amongst others.\n\nDiane Coburn- Brüning's \"The Scarlet Letter\"\n\nGlimmerglass Opera's Production of William Schuman's Opera \"The Mighty Casey\"\n\nDancing and working around the globe\n\nIn Germany, Donna danced with the Giessen Ballet in the State Theatre's Operettas and in Ballet evenings created by the Director W. Anthony and guest Choreographers. She also took company class in Mainz, Germany at the State Theatre's Ballet Company Class during breaks.\n\nIn NYC, Donna worked extensively with, and danced in the company of Milton Myers. Milton is an Internationally acclaimed Teacher and Choreographer who among other accolades, directs the Contemporary Dance Programme at Jacob's Pillow Dance.\n\nShe also danced for years with and worked for Robin Staff who is the Executive Director of 25-year-old www.dancenownyc.org In Robin's Colloquium Contemporary Dance Exchange, she danced pieces choreographed by Neta Pulvermacher, Cliff Keuter, Monica George, Regina Larkin, and Marjorie Mussman. Robin commissioned a work to be made on Donna by Milton Myers titled \"no pain,no gain.\"\n\nMyer's \"no pain, no gain\" for CCDE\n\nDonna was also a lead Dancer with the Michael Mao Dance Company www.michaelmaodance.org. The internationally renowned choreographer Michael Mao created many pieces on her including “Cancion” with a beautiful original score by the Mexican composer Javier Alvarez. Here she also made lifelong friendships with her director and colleagues. They continue to be a part of her life and share their development and experiences in the roles they have taken on in the International Dance World. A moving work Michael made when Donna was in the company, “Verdi’s Requiem”, had a beautiful revival on the Kosovo Ballet in 2013. After suffering from a debilitating and severe injury to her right knee, she later became the Rehearsal Director for this company and worked there until taking up a position as Rehearsal Director of Hubbard Street Dance Chicago. At MMD, she was a key part of the development of the English as a Second Language Dance Programme for the NYC Public School System and she was an integral part of two dance works that were made in collaboration with sight-impaired dance artists. These works toured the US and were ground-breaking in their approach to the integration of sight-impaired dancers with sighted dancers.\n\nMichael Mao’s “Andante Amoroso”\n\nMao's \"Andante Amoroso\"\n\nMao's \"Cancion\"\n\nMao's Ballet \"Murder in Buenos Aires\"\n\nHer colleague and friend Timothy Veach from MMD made and premiered his first work \"Catch me when I fall\" in NYC before relocating to Columbus to found Columbus Dance Theater.\n\nDonna, second from left, in Veach's piece \"Catch me when I fall.\"\n\nKeeping up with individualartistic development, different skills sets, and learning experiences and jobs\n\nMarjorie Mussman also remained a mentor to her during the many years that Donna was able to return to take classes in NYC. Marjorie generously provided contacts for employment, a new awareness in dance training, and along with composer Jonathan Hancock, the honing of a high degree of the marriage of music with the movement. Marjorie set her beautiful solo that was created for Cherylyn Lavagnino on Donna and she performed it in NYC for the Colloquium Contemporary Dance Exchange which evolved eventually into Dance Now NYC.\n\nWith Hubbard Street Dance Chicago, she taught company class, toured, and rehearsed the outstanding dancers in a repertoire which included stellar pieces by Twyla Tharp, Lou Conte, Daniel Ezralow, Margo Sappington, and many other notable and international choreographers. It was a joy for her to learn the repertoire and to maintain the integrity, authenticity, and high level of professionalism that was demanded.\n\nShe has also toured internationally as a dancer, performing in Paris, Oslo, and throughout Mexico with the Cervantino Arts Festival, and throughout the US. Her dancing can be seen in the American television network Public Broadcasting System’s film “Martin” directed by the esteemed “Life Magazine” photographer Gordon Parks with choreography by Rael Lamb, assisted by Leni Wylliams.\n\nHer modelling work can be seen in many dancewear catalogues, in Kodak advertisement campaigns, and in private collections of many artists.\n\nShe also had wide-ranging training in the Alexander Technique, Pilates® with teachers trained by the Pilates Elders and with the fantastic injury preventative and well-crafted Zena Rommett Floor Barre Technique®. These rich foundations for healthy movement remain an important part of her daily approach to dance and fitness.\n\nDonna went on to garner much success with her teaching talents and Directors’ Assistant and Rehearsal Director roles over the last thirty years in both America and Europe. In America she taught for the Enid Knapp Botsford School, David Howard Dance Centre, Minnesota Ballet and School, Michael Mao Dance Company, the Lou Conte Dance Studio and Hubbard Street Dance Company, Columbus Dance Theatre, and the Dansummer program in Colorado. In Europe she has been a guest teacher for the following among others: Geneva Ballet, Tanz Werk Nürnberg, Ballet Freiburg, Basel Tanztheater, the Bruckner Conservatory in Linz, Berlin's “Dance in August,” Cologne Dance Agency, Germany, Modern Dance Turkey, The Linz Ballet, Austria Dance Workplace in Copenhagen, Tanz * Hotel, Vienna, Tiroler Landesballett, Inssbruck, and Amanda Miller's Pretty Ugly Dance Company. http://amandakmiller.com/prettyugly.html.\n\nShe was a Guest teacher in residence via a programme with the American Embassy in Ankara, Turkey for a season at Beyhan Murphy's Modern Dance Turkey at the Ankara State Opera and Ballet Theatre.\n\nDonna taught for Amanda Miller's Pretty Ugly Dance Company first in Innsbruck, Austria at the Tirol State Theatre and was later invited to guest teach the company at their wonderful headquarters in Freiburg, Germany in the breath-taking new premises. She enjoyed many a class and new piece premieres with this eclectic and talented dance troupe and remains friends with many of those talented artists to this day.\n\nLanding in London with her husband\n\nIn London, she taught at Millennium Performing Arts, a leading Performing Arts College, for two and a half years, at the Gielgud Foundation (Re-Animators) and for The Dance Movement. She has also worked as a Guest Director of Rehearsals and Assistant-to-the-Director for other companies in the US and Europe. She guest taught for Robert Hylton's Urban Classicism and Trinity Laban Institute in London, and for Columbus Dance Theatre. Donna also qualified to teach the Zena Rommett Floor-Barre Technique® in NYC.\n\nShe founded Ballet4Life (Ballet4life.com®) in January 2004 and this was one of the first organisations to provide adult learners in London with comprehensive programmes of high-quality ballet and dance classes and courses. This has gone from strength to strength and is now well established and thriving organisation. She has a full teaching group of freelance industry professionals and also has the opportunity to offer workshops and dance intensives all geared toward the adult learners. Her ideas help to spawn a whole generation of schools, dance companies, and organisations to offer vocational dance tuition to adults.\n\nBallet4life images from the last 17 years\n\nGuests and Master Classes\n\nShe had the joy to have Bennie Bartels and Melinda Glenister teach a Tango & Feldenkrais Workshop series, and had Dante Puleio of the Limón Dance Company teach two Master Classes to her clients in May 2013. That Summer she devised and offered a two-week Summer Dance Intensive with classes in Pilates®, Ballet, Contemporary, Zumba®, Lyrical Jazz, Pointe, and Private Tuition.\n\nDonna arranged for Marius Andaházy to offer a Master Class in November 2015 as well. Tara -Brigette Bhavnani of the Royal Ballet gave a Master Class and David Gayle, MBE gave a special Fundraising Talk and Q & A.\n\nBennie leading their workshop\n\nDante leading his dynamic Masterclass\n\nDonna with Marius, Marius leading the Masterclass class\n\nTara leading the Masterclass\n\nDonna with David Gayle\n\nInnovation and Risk Taking\n\nHer 50+ Ballet Programme #silverswans #goldenswans was a huge hit since its launch over twelve years ago and has been replicated by many dance institutes; even by some that had been sceptical about creating classes for the older persons. The 50+ Dancers performed June 2016 in a ballet created on them by Donna called “Signatures.” This group and new groups of over - fifty-year-old dancers have continued to perform every year and the weekly classes are still going strong and they continue to dance and learn weekly online.\n\nIntroduction of other Dance Techniques and Self-Care Skills/programmers has always been a priority to her. In the last seventeen years Donna has produced classes, workshops, masterclasses in Pilates®, Zumba Gold®, Yoga, Ballroom and Latin Dance, Choreography, Repertory, Improvisation, Feldenkreis, Tango, Laban Technique, Zena Rommett Floor-Barre® plus Dynamic Dance Days and week long Summer Dance intensives\n\nChoreography\n\nHer choreography has been commissioned by / shown at the Smithy Gallery NY, Minnesota Ballet under the direction of Allen Fields, www.allenfieldsclassicalballet.com. Dansummer Colorado, Jean Cocteau Repertory Theatre NYC, Dance Now NYC, and Theater aus der Zeche, Germany, The Southern Theater, Minneapolis, The Arts Educational School and Columbus Dance Theatre,http://www.columbusdancetheatre.com/.\n\nShe also created the concept for, produced, and choreographed all of the content and the movement in her quirky and impressive dance film “doubletake” directed by Suzanne Gielgud.
