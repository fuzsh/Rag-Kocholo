        "text": "From The New York Times: “Nico Muhly on the Drama of Bringing His New Opera to the Met”\n\nFrom The New York Times\n\nNico Muhly on rehearsing his new opera, “Marnie”: “I figure it’s only fair of me to be flexible.”CreditCreditDaniel Dorsa for The New York Times\n\nOct. 17, 2018\n\nNico Muhly\n\n“Marnie,” my new opera, which has its American premiere on Friday at the Metropolitan Opera, is about a woman who lies, steals, gets caught and is forced to marry a man who sexually assaults her. It’s delicate material — to say the least — and deeply plot-driven, and the dramatic structure has to be airtight to allow room for expressive musicality.\n\nThe director, Michael Mayer, called me with the idea for a “Marnie” opera five years ago. The story is most famous from the Hitchcock film, but we found that the 1961 Winston Graham novel on which it’s based was a far richer source of psychological tension and freed us from any visual or musical entanglements with the movie. That first notion blossomed into a wonderful libretto by Nicholas Wright, which then turned into a giant stack of manuscript.\n\nNow, in the days before opening, among the orchestra, the chorus, the principal singers, the stage crew, spot ops, dressers, wig-makers, etc., there are hundreds of people reacting to this document; it’s a huge, thrilling, anxiety-producing setup.\n\nIn the middle of rehearsal last week, Nick Wright, Michael and I had a sudden revelation: One of the arias, already endlessly fretted over, was seriously hindering the dramatic flow. The aria, in which Marnie tries to escape her husband but catches herself having second thoughts, was musically satisfying. I’d spent ages getting a kind of throbbing brass chorale to work; there was a clever interplay between the oboe and the voice; and Nick’s text gave us what we thought was a much-needed window into Marnie’s state of mind.\n\nMarnie: TrailerCreditCreditVideo by Metropolitan Opera\n\nBut when Michael was staging the scenes that precede and follow this moment, it immediately became clear that the entire dramatic beat was unnecessary: We were “telling, not showing,” the classic drama-school no-no, and the aria took what should have felt like a satisfying gravitational pull toward the final scene and stalled it midair. (I was reminded of Boris Johnson’s humiliating zip-line ride, where he got stuck in the middle of it, bobbing helplessly over the park.)\n\nWhat if we just — cut it? I rushed over to the full score, figured out a way to make the snip work musically — scooch the oboe’s entrance over a bar; get rid of some vestigial gongs — and we tried it out: It was so much better. It felt like we’d obeyed Coco Chanel’s advice: “Before you leave the house, look in the mirror and take one thing off.” The conductor, Robert Spano, and I mourned the musical loss over a negroni but toasted to how much more successful the last 30 (now 26) minutes of the show would be without it.\n\nWith a piece of concert music, I can tell, more or less, if the structure holds together just by looking through the manuscript in my studio. With a piece of theater, however, I find that on paper and even in rehearsals, the overall soundness of the structure is always just slightly out of view. It’s when you see an opera on stage for the first time with an audience that it feels like shining a black light on a crime scene: Even if you thought you’d carefully wiped clean all of the strange incisions and seams of the compositional process, you’ve still missed a spot.\n\nIsabel Leonard, center, as the title character in “Marnie” at the Metropolitan Opera.Credit Sara Krulwich/The New York Times\n\nNone of this sort of work is, for me, fully possible to execute if I’m sitting at my desk at home. It requires being in the room with Michael; with Nick; with Isabel Leonard, who plays Marnie; with Paul Cremo, the Met’s dramaturg; and seeing the scenes unfold in real time.\n\nI want to know what Isabel thinks about a given transition: She is the one who has to communicate what I wrote, and if there’s anything I can do to help her do that with grace and power, I feel that’s my job as a composer. If I can change an E flat to an F to make the text clearer, I will do it; if we need a better word, Nick will come over, and we’ll confer about how to make it all sync up. When I write a piece of orchestral music, I can be as controlling as I want, but with a piece this big, I try to be the opposite of precious.\n\nThe practical process of mounting an opera is much more crabwise than one might suspect. For the first three weeks, the cast works in a subterranean rehearsal room with the actual floor of the set recreated; some of the real furniture and props are there, but, for example, the tall sliding panels in our full design are represented by shorter, temporary ones. There is a tag team of brilliant rehearsal pianists, the conductor, two assistant conductors, the director, two assistant directors, the stage manager, an assistant stage manager, the dramaturg — and me, in the corner with piles of scores and laptops and iPads and snacks.\n\nThe chorus, which has been rehearsing and memorizing this work since the summer, comes half a dozen times, but not necessarily to work in any particular order; we might find ourselves staging the ending with the chorus before staging the beginning with the cast. We see the orchestra, which is equally busy, in its rehearsal room once or twice without the singers, then twice with the singers — but never with the chorus.\n\nTwo weeks before we open, we start spending the mornings on the main stage with only the pianists. Visual elements creep in: lighting, projections, costumes, with all their attendant joys and problems. (The tracks in the floor seem to be of a thickness precisely designed to entrap the elegant high heels most of the women in this production wear.)\n\nThe week before we open, we have a morning per act with everything (chorus, orchestra, heels), a complete run-through with piano, a complete final dress rehearsal with everything — then opening. The wildest thing about this schedule is that it means that before opening night, there is only one opportunity to see the whole show as a complete piece of theater, which is oftentimes when some of the more deeply-hidden knots reveal themselves. On opening night of “Dark Sisters,” in 2011, I felt a small amount of air leave the theater when I suddenly realized that I’d boxed the show in with a clumsy transition between an indoor space and an abstract outdoor space; I hadn’t perceived this until then.\n\nMy inbox is, as I write this, filling up with requests to come to the dress rehearsal; in London, where “Marnie” had its premiere last year, it seems like a blood sport to go to the dress rather than to a show, and then make subdued but icy declarations of the opera’s wretchedness to anybody who will listen. I always liken the dress rehearsal to that moment in cooking for a group when the stew looks like grave slime (it needs that final 20 minutes to reduce), there are cardoons everywhere, and I’m in a sarong singing along to “Graceland.” It’s not ready yet! Go wait at a bar somewhere!\n\nI’ve learned, after three operas, what sorts of things require my intervention and what will get better on their own. My role, as I understand it now, is to be an editor and custodian of the document Nick and I created, and to guide — but not prescribe — the various options the singers and musicians have in expounding it. Obviously, it’s anxiety provoking, but as it’s not going to be me onstage in a negligee singing a high B flat, or in the pit playing an exposed oboe solo after hundreds of bars’ rest, I figure it’s only fair of me to be flexible, and to allow the thousands of hours of experience and diligent preparation to let the piece live on its own.\n\nNico Muhly’s “Two Boys” was performed by the Metropolitan Opera in 2013.\n\nMarnie\n\nFriday through Nov. 10 at the Metropolitan Opera, Manhattan; http://www.metopera.org.\n\nSee the full article here .\n\nfive-ways-keep-your-child-safe-school-shootings\n\nPlease help promote STEM in your local schools.\n\nStem Education Coalition\n\nFor new music by living composers\n\nnewsounds.org from New York Public Radio\n\nhttps://www.wnyc.org/\n\n93.9FM\n\nhttps://www.wqxr.org/\n\n105.9FM\n\nHome\n\nFor great Jazz\n\n88.3FM http://wbgo.org/\n\nWPRB 103.3FM\n\nPlease visit The Jazz Loft Project based on the work of Sam Stephenson\n\nPlease visit The Jazz Loft Radio project from New York Public Radio\n\nFrom NEWMUSICUSA: “InsightALT: Opera in Eden”\n\nFrom NEWMUSICUSA\n\nThursday, May 17, 2018\n\nat 7:30 PM\n\nMerkin Concert Hall\n\n129 West 67th Street\n\nNew York, NY 10036\n\n$25\n\nTickets\n\nALT concludes its 10th Anniversary celebration of the Composer Librettist Development Program with InsightALT: Opera in Eden, a one-night-only concert featuring three new one-act operas written by this year’s new class of Resident Artists. This event provides the opportunity to see the “next step” in the development of the three operas featured as part of The Living Libretto event in March. The evening will be hosted by composer/librettist Mark Adamo and Producing Artistic Director Lawrence Edelson.\n\nAmerican Lyric Theater (ALT)\n\nGreat operas don’t just happen.\n\nAmerican Lyric Theater (ALT) was founded in 2005 to build a new body of operatic repertoire for new audiences by nurturing composers and librettists, developing sustainable artistic collaborations, and contributing new works to the national canon. Many opera companies commission and perform new works; but ALT is the only company in the United States that offers extensive, full-time mentorship for emerging operatic writers. While the traditional company model focuses on producing a season, ALT’s programs focus on serving the needs of artists, developing new works, and collaborating with producing companies to help usher those works into the repertoire.\n\nIn 2007, ALT launched its core initiative, the Composer Librettist Development Program (CLDP), led by Producing Artistic Director Lawrence Edelson and a faculty including some of the country’s foremost artists, including composer-librettist Mark Adamo, composers Robert Beaser and Paul Moravec, librettists Mark Campbell and Michael Korie, dramaturg Cori Ellison, soprano Catherine Malfitano, and stage director Rhoda Levine.\n\nThrough the CLDP, ALT has provided intensive, personalized mentorship to 38 gifted emerging artists, and 15 short chamber operas have been developed under the auspices of the program. In addition, ALT has commissioned and developed 8 full-length operas through the CLDP. To present fully staged productions of these works, ALT has partnered with Atlanta Opera, Opera Theatre of Saint Louis, Tulsa Opera, Fargo-Moorhead Opera, Fort Worth Opera, Opera Saratoga, and others. Alumni artists are also at the forefront of creating new operas for companies around the country. CLDP alumni are currently writing new works for Opera Philadelphia, Houston Grand Opera and The Metropolitan Opera.\n\nRecently premiered and upcoming productions of operas commissioned by ALT include The Poe Project, a double-bill of one-act operas, Buried Alive by Jeff Myers and Quincy Long, and Embedded by Patrick Soluri and Deborah Brevoort (Fargo-Moorhead Opera 2014, Fort Worth Opera 2016); JFK by David T. Little and CLDP alumnus Royce Vavrek (FWOpera 2016); and The Long Walk by Jeremy Howard Beck and Stephanie Fleischmann, based on the memoir by Brian Castner (Opera Saratoga 2015, Utah Opera 2017).\n\nALT’s public performance programs provide the opportunity for audiences in New York City to see operas-in-progress through two series: The Living Libretto and InsightALT. To celebrate CLDP alumni, who are creating new operas for companies around the country, we launched a new concert series, ALT Alumni: Composers and Librettists in Concert, in November 2015, which was recently lauded in Opera News for offering New Yorkers “the rare opportunity to hear excerpts of what audiences in Houston, St. Louis, Los Angeles and Saratoga Springs have already heard. And, it turns out, we’ve been missing out on fantastic opera written by living, young composers!”\n\nIn the 2015-16 season, ALT provided personalized mentorship to 8 gifted composers and librettists through the CLDP working on four new operas: La Reina by Jorge Sosa and Laura Sosa Pedroza, The Life and Death(s) of Alan Turing by Justine F. Chen and David Simpatico, The Halloween Tree by Theo Popov and Tony Asaro, and Sherlock Holmes and the Case of the Fallen Giant by Evan Meier and E.M. Lewis.\n\nThe Long Walk – Final Scene from Act 1\n\nCommissioned and developed by American Lyric Theater.

Our mission is to support and promote new music created in the United States. We do that in many ways, fostering connections, deepening knowledge, encouraging appreciation, and providing financial support. In recognition of the possibility and power inherent in the virtual world, we’ve worked to build a strong internet platform to serve our constituency. And that constituency is broad and diverse, from composers and performers to presenters and producers, casual listeners to die-hard fans. We’re truly committed to serving the WHOLE new music community.\n\nAs we go about our work, we make a point of not defining too precisely what we mean by new music. To define is to limit. It’s a spectacular time for musical creativity in part because so much music is being made that isn’t bound by conventional limitations of style or genre or background. The music that we hear being created in such abundance all around us is definition enough. We simply want it to flourish.\n\nWe’re fortunate to have as our legacy the history of previous decades of good works done by the American Music Center and Meet The Composer, the two great organizations that merged to form us in 2011. Their legacies have also brought a small financial endowment that mostly helps support our grantmaking. But we’re not a foundation. We depend decisively each year on the generosity of so many institutions and individuals around the country who are dedicated as we are to the advancement of new music and are devoted to supporting our work.\n\nNew Music USA is part of an international community of advocates for the arts. We’re members of the Performing Arts Alliance, the International Association of Music Information Centres, and the International Society for Contemporary Music. Those partnerships help us represent the interests of our constituents at every level.\n\nNo matter how far ranging our networks, our focus is always solidly on what brings these many constituents and communities together in the first place: the music. When someone uses our platform to listen to something new, recommend a favorite to a friend, or to seek financial assistance or information to support the creation or performance of new work, the whole community is strengthened. Together we’re helping new music reach new ears every day.\n\nOur Vision\n\nWe envision in the United States a thriving, interconnected new music community that is available to and impactful for a broad constituency of people.\n\nOur Mission\n\nNew Music USA supports and promotes new music created in the United States. We use the power of virtual networks and people to foster connection, deepen knowledge, encourage appreciation, and provide financial support for a diverse constituency of practitioners and appreciators, both within the United States and beyond.\n\nOur Values\n\nWe believe in the fundamental importance of creative artists and their work.\n\nWe espouse a broad, inclusive understanding of the term “new music.”\n\nWe uphold and embrace principles of inclusivity and equitable treatment in all of our activity and across our nation’s broadly diverse population in terms of gender, race, age, location, national origin, sexual orientation, religion, socio-economic status and artistic practice.\n\nFor new music by living composers\n\nnewsounds.org from New York Public Radio\n\nhttps://www.wnyc.org/\n\n93.9FM\n\nhttps://www.wqxr.org/\n\n105.9FM\n\nHome\n\nFor great Jazz\n\n88.3FM http://wbgo.org/\n\nWPRB 103.3FM\n\nDan Buskirk Spinning Jazz Mondays 11:00AM-1:00PM\n\nWill Constantine Jr, Blues Bop and Beyond Thursdays 11:00-2:00 featuring Latin Jazz\n\nJerry Gordon Serenade to a Cookoo Frdays 11:00AM-2:00PM with Jerry’s Room at 1:00Pm\n\nJeannie Becker Sunday Jazz 10:00AM-1:00Pm\n\nPlease visit The Jazz Loft Project based on the work of Sam Stephenson\n\nPlease visit The Jazz Loft Radio project from New York Public Radio\n\nFrom Vanderbilt University: “Class of 2018: Samantha Long sings with body and soul”\n\nFrom Vanderbilt University\n\nMay. 7, 2018\n\nMyVU has profiled 14 members of the Class of 2018. We’re featuring their stories in the lead up to Commencement on May 11.\n\nSamantha Long is an Eldon Stevenson Scholar. (Joe Howell/Vanderbilt)\n\nSamantha Long, a Johnston, Iowa, native majoring in musical arts (voice) at Blair School of Music, came to Nashville with many interests, not certain if music would be her path. But after doing a bit of searching, she found that singing was still her passion.\n\n“I explored a lot of things—political science, neuroscience, communications,” she said. “I was explaining this to a friend in an opera production my sophomore year, and she said, ‘Oh, so you don’t want to perform?’ And I realized right then—yes, I do want to perform.”\n\nThe soprano has performed in Vanderbilt Opera Theatre productions each year, including a featured role in Leonard Bernstein’s Mass (2015), the lead role of Jo in Mark Adamo’s Little Women (2016), and the demanding role of Countess Almaviva in last fall’s production of Mozart’s Marriage of Figaro. Last summer Long attended Prague Summer Nights, touring the Czech Republic as the Second Lady in Mozart’s Magic Flute, and spent the rest of the summer in France at Festival Lyrique International de Belle-Île en Mer in the ensemble of Elixir of Love by Donizetti. She said she finds the feeling of singing addicting.\n\n“If I’m singing a B flat at the climax of a piece, I feel all the vibrations around me and through my voice and my body. Singing is interesting, because you can’t see what makes the sound the way you can look at piano keys as you play,” she explained. “Learning voice technique comes down to focusing on how you’re feeling tension or release or breath. Your body is your instrument, so you have to be really attuned to how you feel the music. A lot of our education is about how to access that feeling on cue.”\n\nThis fall, Long will pursue a master of music in vocal performance at Rice University’s Shepherd School of Music. Her Vanderbilt education has included service work through a summer in Russia in 2016 as the recipient of a Nichols Humanitarian Fund grant. She valued that experience so much, she added a minor in Russian to her degree program. Closer to home, Long and fellow students in a Lyric Theater class worked with clients of the Mary Parrish Center for victims of domestic and sexual violence to create a show based on narratives about their lives.\n\n“I think one of the best ways art can serve others is by giving a voice to those who have had their voices quieted in some way,” she said.\n\nSee the full article here .\n\nPlease help promote STEM in your local schools.\n\nStem Education Coalition\n\nCommodore Cornelius Vanderbilt was in his 79th year when he decided to make the gift that founded Vanderbilt University in the spring of 1873.\n\nThe $1 million that he gave to endow and build the university was the commodore’s only major philanthropy. Methodist Bishop Holland N. McTyeire of Nashville, husband of Amelia Townsend who was a cousin of the commodore’s young second wife Frank Crawford, went to New York for medical treatment early in 1873 and spent time recovering in the Vanderbilt mansion. He won the commodore’s admiration and support for the project of building a university in the South that would “contribute to strengthening the ties which should exist between all sections of our common country.”\n\nMcTyeire chose the site for the campus, supervised the construction of buildings and personally planted many of the trees that today make Vanderbilt a national arboretum. At the outset, the university consisted of one Main Building (now Kirkland Hall), an astronomical observatory and houses for professors. Landon C. Garland was Vanderbilt’s first chancellor, serving from 1875 to 1893. He advised McTyeire in selecting the faculty, arranged the curriculum and set the policies of the university.\n\nFor the first 40 years of its existence, Vanderbilt was under the auspices of the Methodist Episcopal Church, South. The Vanderbilt Board of Trust severed its ties with the church in June 1914 as a result of a dispute with the bishops over who would appoint university trustees.\n\nkirkland hallFrom the outset, Vanderbilt met two definitions of a university: It offered work in the liberal arts and sciences beyond the baccalaureate degree and it embraced several professional schools in addition to its college. James H. Kirkland, the longest serving chancellor in university history (1893-1937), followed Chancellor Garland. He guided Vanderbilt to rebuild after a fire in 1905 that consumed the main building, which was renamed in Kirkland’s honor, and all its contents. He also navigated the university through the separation from the Methodist Church. Notable advances in graduate studies were made under the third chancellor, Oliver Cromwell Carmichael (1937-46). He also created the Joint University Library, brought about by a coalition of Vanderbilt, Peabody College and Scarritt College.\n\nRemarkable continuity has characterized the government of Vanderbilt. The original charter, issued in 1872, was amended in 1873 to make the legal name of the corporation “The Vanderbilt University.” The charter has not been altered since.\n\nThe university is self-governing under a Board of Trust that, since the beginning, has elected its own members and officers. The university’s general government is vested in the Board of Trust. The immediate government of the university is committed to the chancellor, who is elected by the Board of Trust.\n\nThe original Vanderbilt campus consisted of 75 acres. By 1960, the campus had spread to about 260 acres of land. When George Peabody College for Teachers merged with Vanderbilt in 1979, about 53 acres were added.\n\nwyatt centerVanderbilt’s student enrollment tended to double itself each 25 years during the first century of the university’s history: 307 in the fall of 1875; 754 in 1900; 1,377 in 1925; 3,529 in 1950; 7,034 in 1975. In the fall of 1999 the enrollment was 10,127.\n\nIn the planning of Vanderbilt, the assumption seemed to be that it would be an all-male institution. Yet the board never enacted rules prohibiting women. At least one woman attended Vanderbilt classes every year from 1875 on. Most came to classes by courtesy of professors or as special or irregular (non-degree) students. From 1892 to 1901 women at Vanderbilt gained full legal equality except in one respect — access to dorms. In 1894 the faculty and board allowed women to compete for academic prizes. By 1897, four or five women entered with each freshman class. By 1913 the student body contained 78 women, or just more than 20 percent of the academic enrollment.\n\nNational recognition of the university’s status came in 1949 with election of Vanderbilt to membership in the select Association of American Universities. In the 1950s Vanderbilt began to outgrow its provincial roots and to measure its achievements by national standards under the leadership of Chancellor Harvie Branscomb. By its 90th anniversary in 1963, Vanderbilt for the first time ranked in the top 20 private universities in the United States.\n\nVanderbilt continued to excel in research, and the number of university buildings more than doubled under the leadership of Chancellors Alexander Heard (1963-1982) and Joe B. Wyatt (1982-2000), only the fifth and sixth chancellors in Vanderbilt’s long and distinguished history. Heard added three schools (Blair, the Owen Graduate School of Management and Peabody College) to the seven already existing and constructed three dozen buildings. During Wyatt’s tenure, Vanderbilt acquired or built one-third of the campus buildings and made great strides in diversity, volunteerism and technology.\n\nThe university grew and changed significantly under its seventh chancellor, Gordon Gee, who served from 2000 to 2007. Vanderbilt led the country in the rate of growth for academic research funding, which increased to more than $450 million and became one of the most selective undergraduate institutions in the country.\n\nOn March 1, 2008, Nicholas S. Zeppos was named Vanderbilt’s eighth chancellor after serving as interim chancellor beginning Aug. 1, 2007. Prior to that, he spent 2002-2008 as Vanderbilt’s provost, overseeing undergraduate, graduate and professional education programs as well as development, alumni relations and research efforts in liberal arts and sciences, engineering, music, education, business, law and divinity. He first came to Vanderbilt in 1987 as an assistant professor in the law school. In his first five years, Zeppos led the university through the most challenging economic times since the Great Depression, while continuing to attract the best students and faculty from across the country and around the world. Vanderbilt got through the economic crisis notably less scathed than many of its peers and began and remained committed to its much-praised enhanced financial aid policy for all undergraduates during the same timespan. The Martha Rivers Ingram Commons for first-year students opened in 2008 and College Halls, the next phase in the residential education system at Vanderbilt, is on track to open in the fall of 2014. During Zeppos’ first five years, Vanderbilt has drawn robust support from federal funding agencies, and the Medical Center entered into agreements with regional hospitals and health care systems in middle and east Tennessee that will bring Vanderbilt care to patients across the state.\n\nstudentsToday, Vanderbilt University is a private research university of about 6,500 undergraduates and 5,300 graduate and professional students. The university comprises 10 schools, a public policy center and The Freedom Forum First Amendment Center. Vanderbilt offers undergraduate programs in the liberal arts and sciences, engineering, music, education and human development as well as a full range of graduate and professional degrees. The university is consistently ranked as one of the nation’s top 20 universities by publications such as U.S. News & World Report, with several programs and disciplines ranking in the top 10.\n\nCutting-edge research and liberal arts, combined with strong ties to a distinguished medical center, creates an invigorating atmosphere where students tailor their education to meet their goals and researchers collaborate to solve complex questions affecting our health, culture and society.\n\nVanderbilt, an independent, privately supported university, and the separate, non-profit Vanderbilt University Medical Center share a respected name and enjoy close collaboration through education and research. Together, the number of people employed by these two organizations exceeds that of the largest private employer in the Middle Tennessee region.\n\nRelated links\n\n“Bard SummerScape 2018 Presents Rare New American Production of Anton Rubinstein’s Demon (July 27–Aug 5)”\n\nBard Music Festival\n\nPlus Rimsky-Korsakov’s Operas Mozart and Salieri (Aug 18) and The Tsar’s Bride (Aug 19) in Bard Music Festival\n\n“Some of the most important summer opera experiences in the U.S. are not at the better-known festivals but at Bard SummerScape.”\n\n– Financial Times\n\nCommitted since its inception to reviving important but neglected operas, Bard SummerScape has long proven itself “an indispensable part of the summer operatic landscape” (Musical America). Offering a rare new American production of Demon by Anton Rubinstein as its operatic centerpiece, this year’s immersion in Rimsky-Korsakov and His World is no exception. With Olga Tolkmit and Efim Zavalny heading an all-Russian cast in an original staging by renowned American director Thaddeus Strassberger, with the support of the American Symphony Orchestra under the leadership of music director and festival co-artistic director Leon Botstein, Demon runs for five performances between July 27 and August 5, with an Opera Talk, free and open to the public, before the matinee on July 29. SummerScape 2018 also provides the chance to see Rimsky-Korsakov’s seldom-staged operas Mozart and Salieri (August 18) and The Tsar’s Bride (August 19) during the 29th annual Bard Music Festival. Anchored by the Bard Festival Chorale under the direction of James Bagwell, all three presentations take place on Bard’s glorious Hudson Valley campus in the striking Frank Gehry-designed Fisher Center. As Time Out New York notes, “Botstein and Bard SummerScape show courage, foresight and great imagination, honoring operas that larger institutions are content to ignore.”\n\nAnton Rubinstein’s Demon (1871)\n\nIt was Anton Rubinstein (1829–94), Rimsky-Korsakov’s senior by 15 years, who founded the St. Petersburg Conservatory, now named for the younger composer. Both men had an enormous influence on the next generation of Russian composition, and although in his lifetime Rubinstein was best known as a keyboard virtuoso and star pedagogue whose students included Tchaikovsky, he was also a prolific composer with no fewer than 20 operas to his name. The most popular of these was Demon (1871), one of the two operas mounted most often in 19th-century Russia, and the country’s first to be produced in Britain. Yet despite its rich choruses and fiery libretto, today Rubinstein’s masterpiece has fallen into neglect and is almost never staged in the English-speaking world.\n\nComposed in three acts to a libretto by Pavel Viskovatov, Demon was based on a narrative poem by Mikhail Lermontov that was initially banned as sacrilegious. Like the poem, Rubinstein’s opera depicts a demon, or fallen angel, who meets Tamara, a mortal princess, and falls desperately in love, trying everything in his power to seduce her. Tamara’s struggle to resist him becomes a battle not only for her soul but for the fate of the earth itself. When at last she weakens, the price of her redemption is death, and the demon is condemned to eternal solitude.\n\nOn the few occasions it has been heard in the West, Demon has received a warm welcome. After a concert performance by the Kirov Opera at the 2003 Lincoln Center Festival, the New York Times admired the composer’s “sure lyrical gift and command of the orchestra,” while a 2009 London presentation prompted Gramophone to admire “Rubinstein’s colourful and lyrically expressive score.” As The Independent declared: “You can see why it did, and still does, carry the wow factor in Russia.”\n\nBard’s full staging represents an all-too-rare opportunity to see Rubinstein’s opera mounted outside the composer’s homeland. Conceived expressly for SummerScape 2018, the new production is by renowned American director Thaddeus Strassberger, whose previous SummerScape productions are among Bard’s most resounding success stories. The Financial Times declared: “Les Huguenots in Bard’s staging is a thriller from beginning to end. … Five Stars.” New York magazine named his treatment of Der ferne Klang one of the “Top Ten Classical Music Events of 2010”; the Wall Street Journal called his take on Le roi malgré lui “hilarious”; and the New York Times found his handling of The Wreckers “extraordinarily successful.” As for his treatment of Oresteia by Rubinstein’s contemporary Sergei Taneyev, which marked the opera’s first fully staged production outside Russia, it was nominated for a 2014 International Opera Award.\n\nMaking his U.S. debut in Demon’s title role is baritone Efim Zavalny, first prize-winner at the International Shtokolov Vocalists’ Competition. Singing opposite him as Tamara is soprano Olga Tolkmit, a nominee for Russia’s prestigious Golden Mask Award, in her third major role at Bard; having impressed the Financial Times with her “resonant, bright-voiced soprano” in Oresteia, she returned to grace Dvořák’s Dimitrij last summer. Belarusian bass Andrey Valentiy, who has appeared at Moscow’s Bolshoi Theatre and Milan’s La Scala, sings Tamara’s father, Prince Gudal. Her Nanny is portrayed by mezzo-soprano Ekaterina Egorova, a frequent leading lady at St. Petersburg’s Mikhailovsky Opera. Likewise tenor Alexander Nesterenko, who sings Tamara’s fiancé, Prince Sinodal, regularly headlines productions at Moscow’s Stanislavsky Opera. Bard’s all-Russian cast is completed by bass-baritone Yakov Strizhak as Sinodal’s Old Servant, mezzo-soprano Nadezhda Babintseva as the Angel, and tenor Pavel Sulyandziga as the Messenger. The opera’s thrilling dance sequences will be performed by the highly respected Georgian dance troupe, Pesvebi Georgian Dancers.\n\nSets for Demon are designed by Paul Tate dePoo III, who was nominated for a 2017 Helen Hayes Award. The production will be enhanced by video projections from Greg Emetaz, known for his work for New York City Opera and San Francisco Opera, with lighting design by JAX Messenger, whose work on Oresteia helped ensure that “Strassberger’s cohesive vision … was searingly powerful” (Opera News). Demon’s costume design is by Obie Award-winner Kaye Voyce, whose extensive credits range from Broadway to the Royal Shakespeare Company, as well as numerous Bard theater and dance productions.\n\nHigh resolution images for Bard’s production of Demon are available here.\n\nRimsky-Korsakov’s Mozart and Salieri (1897), Bard Music Festival Program 8\n\nNo 19th-century composer contributed more substantially to Russia’s opera repertoire than Rimsky-Korsakov, who wrote 16 examples of the genre. Based on the same Pushkin verse drama that inspired Peter Shaffer’s Amadeus, his one-act opera Mozart and Salieri covers the same territory, animating the rumor that Salieri, official composer of Vienna’s Hapsburg court, so envied Mozart’s genius that he was driven to poison him. Although the opera is rarely mounted even in Russia, this is to be regretted, according to the New York Times, which – citing “the opera’s success and originality” – ranked it among the composer’s “most interesting work.”\n\nForming the second half of a program exploring Domestic Music Making in Russia, Bard’s presentation of the opera stars tenor Gerard Schneider, whose “imposing tenor” (Wall Street Journal) “stole the show” (Allegri con Fuoco) in SummerScape 2016’s mainstage production of Iris. Schneider sings the role of Mozart, with Grammy nominee Mikhail Svetlov, who impressed the Washington Post with his “titanic, all-encompassing bass,” as the composer’s nemesis, Salieri.\n\nThere will be a talk before the concert by festival co-artistic director Christopher Gibbs, who is the James H. Ottaway Jr. Professor of Music at Bard College.\n\nRimsky-Korsakov’s The Tsar’s Bride (1898), Bard Music Festival Program 12\n\nFor his tenth opera, Rimsky-Korsakov combined the fantastic with the historical, turning to the so-called Time of Troubles, the same period of Russian history that inspired Boris Godunov and SummerScape 2017’s Dimitrij. Based on a play by Lev Mey, The Tsar’s Bride depicts Marfa, the merchant’s daughter whom Ivan the Terrible (a silent role, in accordance with Tsarist censorship laws) chooses from among thousands of pretty girls as his third wife. Unfortunately she is already in love with another and subject to the unwanted attentions of a third, who attempts to give her a love potion. When poison is substituted, and the man she loves is blamed and executed, Marfa loses her mind, providing the opera with a bona fide mad scene. Although the familiar Slava anthem functions throughout as a leitmotif, Rimsky-Korsakov explained that he intended The Tsar’s Bride as a reaction against Wagner’s ideas, and aimed for “cantilena par excellence.” This proved successful in his homeland, where the opera was warmly welcomed at its premiere, and has remained in regular rotation ever since. In the West, by contrast, revivals are rare. Yet The Tsar’s Bride is “an upfront rumbustious melodrama, packed with big tunes and thrilling climaxes” (The Telegraph, UK). Moreover, it offers “a compelling study of power and powerlessness” (The Independent, UK), and has “one of the most lyrical of all Rimsky-Korsakov scores” (New York Times).\n\nBard’s semi-staged production features The Orchestra Now (TŌN), Bard’s graduate training orchestra, under Botstein’s leadership. In the title role of Marfa, it stars Lyubov Petrova, “a soprano of ravishing, changeable beauty, blazing high notes and magnetic stage presence” (Opera News). Demon’s Andrey Valentiy sings Marfa’s father, Vasily Sobakin, and Mozart and Salieri’s Gerard Schneider takes the role of her falsely accused suitor, Ivan Likov. Efim Zavalny, the Demon himself, plays her third admirer, Grigory Gryaznoy, with mezzo-soprano Nadezhda Babintseva, who “brought the house down” (RTE) on tour with the Moscow State Opera, as Lyubasha, his murderous mistress. Joel Sorensen, “a beautifully expressive tenor, gifted at characterization” (The Independent, UK), appears as the Tsar’s physician, Yelisey Bomeliy, with bass-baritone Yakov Strizhak, first-prize-winner at the Rachmaninov International Music Competition, as an oprichnik, or member of the imperial police force. Rounding out Bard’s stellar cast as Petrovna, the Sobakins’ housekeeper, is mezzo-soprano Teresa Buchholz, winner of the female division at Carnegie Hall’s Nico Castel International Master Singer Competition; she returns to the festival after a series of “consistently excellent” (New York Arts) performances in previous SummerScape seasons.\n\nWith lighting by Anshuman Bhatia, named a “Young Designer to Watch” by Live Design magazine, Bard’s semi-staged production is designed and directed by Doug Fitch, the co-founder of Giants Are Small. Consistently cited as benchmarks of innovation, his New York Philharmonic collaborations include Le Grand Macabre, named “Best Opera of the Year” by the New York Times, New York magazine, and Time Out New York; and The Cunning Little Vixen, chosen as the “Best Classical Event of the Year” by New York.\n\nBefore the opera, there will be a talk by Bard’s 2018 Scholar-in-Residence, Marina Frolova-Walker, author of Russian Music and Nationalism: from Glinka to Stalin and editor of the forthcoming volume Nikolai Rimsky-Korsakov and His World.\n\nAbout opera at Bard SummerScape\n\nSince the opening of the Fisher Center at Bard, Botstein and the American Symphony Orchestra have been responsible for championing and restoring to the stage a growing number of important but long-neglected operas. All these presentations and their remarkable stagings have been warmly received by audiences and critics alike – not least, last season’s full staging of Dvořák’s Dimitrij. The New York Times admired Bard’s “simple and effective updated production,” called the “vivid choral scenes … a triumph for the impressive Bard Festival Chorale,” and concluded:\n\n“Mr. Botstein drew vibrant playing and a well-paced performance from the American Symphony Orchestra. … He, the festival and this hard-working cast deserve thanks.”\n\nAs Musical America recognizes: “Bard’s annual opera has become an indispensable part of the summer operatic landscape.”\n\nIllustrating the scope and originality of the festival’s programming, a list of Bard’s previous operatic offerings follows below:\n\n2017: Dvořák – Dimitrij (first fully staged American production)\n\nMoniuszko – Halka\n\n2016: Mascagni – Iris\n\nPuccini – Il tabarro and Le Villi; Massenet – La Navarraise; Busoni – Turandot; Puccini/Berio – Turandot, Act III\n\n2015: Smyth – The Wreckers (first fully staged American production)\n\n2014: Weber – Euryanthe (first American revival in 100 years)\n\nSchubert – Fierrabras; Die Verschworenen\n\nvon Suppé – Franz Schubert\n\n2013: Taneyev – Oresteia (first fully staged production outside Russia)\n\nStravinsky – Oedipus Rex, Perséphone, and Mavra\n\n2012: Chabrier – Le roi malgré lui (first staged revival of original version)\n\nSaint-Saëns – Henry VIII\n\n2011: Strauss – Die Liebe der Danae (first fully staged New York production)\n\n2010: Schreker – Der ferne Klang\n\nHindemith – Sancta Susanna\n\nWeill – Royal Palace\n\n2009: Meyerbeer – Les Huguenots\n\n2008: Szymanowski – King Roger; Harnasie (double-bill)\n\n2007: Zemlinsky – Der Zwerg; Eine florentinische Tragödie (first U.S. double-bill production)\n\n2006: Schumann – Genoveva (first U.S. professional production)\n\n2005: Blitzstein – Regina\n\n2004: Shostakovich – The Nose (first East-coast professional production)\n\n2003: Janáček – Osud (first U.S. staged production)\n\nClick here to see a celebration of opera at Bard SummerScape.\n\nOpera at Bard SummerScape 2018\n\nAnton Rubinstein (1829–94)\n\nDemon (1871)\n\nAmerican Symphony Orchestra\n\nConducted by Leon Botstein, music director\n\nDirected by Thaddeus Strassberger\n\nBard Festival Chorale\n\nConducted by James Bagwell\n\nPaul Tate dePoo III: set designer\n\nKaye Voyce: costume designer\n\nCandida Nichols: associate costumer\n\nJAX Messenger: lighting designer\n\nGreg Emetaz: video designer\n\nShorena Barbakadz: choreographer\n\nAnne Ford-Coates: hair and makeup designer\n\nOnofrio Colucci: acting coach/assistant director\n\nRoza Tulyaganova: diction coach/assistant director\n\nJordan Fein: assistant director\n\nDemon: Efim Zavalny, baritone\n\nTamara: Olga Tolkmit, soprano\n\nAngel: Nadezhda Babintseva, mezzo-soprano\n\nPrince Gudal: Andrey Valentiy, bass\n\nPrince Sinodal: Alexander Nesterenko, tenor\n\nNanny: Ekaterina Egorova, mezzo-soprano\n\nOld Servant: Yakov Strizhak, bass-baritone\n\nMessenger: Pavel Sulyandziga, tenor\n\nPesvebi Georgian Dancers\n\nSosnoff Theater\n\nJuly 27* at 8 pm\n\nJuly 29*; August 1, 3* & 5* at 2 pm\n\nTickets start at $25\n\nOpening Night Reception for Members\n\nJuly 27\n\nOpera Talk with Leon Botstein\n\nJuly 29 at 12 pm\n\nFree and open to the public\n\nOpera in the 2018 Bard Music Festival, Rimsky-Korsakov and His World\n\nNikolai Rimsky-Korsakov (18441908)\n\nMozart and Salieri (1897)\n\nBard Festival Chorale\n\nConducted by James Bagwell\n\nMozart: Gerard Schneider, tenor\n\nSalieri: Mikhail Svetlov, bass\n\nAugust 18\n\nProgram Eight, Domestic Music Making in Russia\n\nOlin Hall\n\n1 pm Preconcert Talk: Christopher Gibbs\n\n1:30 pm Performance\n\nTickets: $40\n\nNikolai Rimsky-Korsakov (18441908)\n\nThe Tsar’s Bride (1898)\n\nThe Orchestra Now (TŌN)\n\nConducted by Leon Botstein\n\nBard Festival Chorale\n\nConducted by James Bagwell\n\nDesigned and directed by Doug Fitch\n\nLighting design: Anshuman Bhatia\n\nMarfa: Lyubov Petrova, soprano\n\nLyubasha: Nadezhda Babintseva, mezzo-soprano\n\nGrigory Gryaznoy: Efim Zavalny, baritone\n\nVasily Sobakin: Andrey Valentiy, bass\n\nMalyuta Skuratov: Yakov Strizhak, bass-baritone\n\nYelisey Bomeliy: Joel Sorensen, tenor\n\nIvan Likov: Gerard Schneider, tenor\n\nPetrovna: Teresa Buchholz, mezzo-soprano\n\nAugust 19\n\nProgram Twelve, The Tsar’s Bride*\n\nSosnoff Theater\n\n3:30 pm Preconcert Talk: Marina Frolova-Walker\n\n4:30 pm Performance\n\nTickets: $25–$75\n\nRound-trip transportation from Manhattan to Bard is available for this performance.

Gibbs, Artistic Directors\n\nThe Bard Music Festival was founded in 1990 to promote new ways of understanding and presenting the history of music to a contemporary audience. Each year, a single composer is chosen as the main subject. The biography of the composer, the influences and consequences of that composer’s achievement, and all aspects of the musical culture surrounding the time and place of the composer’s life are explored. Perhaps the most important dimensions of the festival are the ways in which it links music to the worlds of literature, painting, theater, philosophy, and politics and brings two kinds of audience together: those with a long history of interest in concert life and first-time listeners, who find the festival an ideal place to learn about and enjoy the riches of our musical past.\n\nPlease help promote STEM in your local schools.\n\nStem Education Coalition\n\nFor new music by living composers\n\nnewsounds.org from New York Public Radio\n\nhttps://www.wnyc.org/\n\n93.9FM\n\nhttps://www.wqxr.org/\n\n105.9FM\n\nHome\n\nFor great Jazz\n\n88.3FM http://wbgo.org/\n\nWPRB 103.3FM\n\nDan Buskirk Spinning Jazz Mondays 11:00AM-1:00PM\n\nWill Constantine Jr, Blues Bop and Beyond Thursdays 11:00-2:00 featuring Latin Jazz\n\nJerry Gordon Serenade to a Cookoo Frdays 11:00AM-2:00PM with Jerry’s Room at 1:00Pm\n\nJeannie Becker Sunday Jazz 10:00AM-1:00Pm\n\nPlease visit The Jazz Loft Project based on the work of Sam Stephenson\n\nPlease visit The Jazz Loft Radio project from New York Public Radio"
