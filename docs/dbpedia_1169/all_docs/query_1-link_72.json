        "text": "Hawaii 2005\n\nHome from Hawaii where even bad news is delivered by newscasters in Aloha shirts. It was a fabulous trip with the usual Levine family foibles.\n\nNEVER take Hawaiian Airlines. In a world a lackadaisical don’t-give-a-shit airline employees Hawaiian is the gold standard. It’s bad enough our luggage didn’t arrive with the flight. Neither did the bags for half the passengers. And this was true of EVERY Hawaiian flight. Seems they sort of put on the bags they want and hold back others. Or put bags on earlier flights and just leave them in the terminal as sort of a fun scavenger hunt. Their motto should be: “Striving to be America West”.\n\nWe went back to the Grand Wailea on Maui – picture a combination of the Bellagio and Disney’s Blizzard Beach Water Slide Park.\n\nWe have a “Mountain view” room and by “Mountain” they mean the Four Seasons next door. I can now tell you which Endeavor agents sleep late.\n\nQuickly unpacked, leaving a drawer empty for all the coffee packets, soap, conditioners, shampoos, and pens we planned to steal. No sewing kits this year. Those bastards!!\n\nWent to sleep after a long travel day only to discover our room is only two floors right above the Tsunami night club. Is it just me or should they consider a name change? I’d change rooms but where else am I going to hear pidgin hip hop…as it was meant to be heard -- through the floor?\n\nAnnie’s was very excited about the GAP Winter Sale. Needless to say there wasn’t a single heavy coat, ski sweater, or scarf they were out of at the Wailea GAP.\n\nSecond day there I saw a schmuck wearing a CAA T-shirt. It flashed me back to years ago at the Kahala Hilton when I saw someone else wearing one of those. Remember as a kid you would put a comic book inside a real book so the teacher thought you were reading something worthwhile? In this case, sitting around the pool, this CAA tool was reading a book hidden inside a SCRIPT.\n\nWent to make massage reservations at the spa. Was told they were having a “big promotion”. If you use this brand of massage oil they were hawking that smells like cinnamon and vanilla you get a whole $5.00 off their $155 massage. You’d be an IDIOT not to take advantage of that deal!\n\nI don’t think the University of Nevada (Reno) will be asked back to the Hawaiian Bowl anytime soon. This annual football classic held Christmas Eve at Aloha Stadium (capacity: 50,000) and televised nationally on ESPN is a great source of pride to the islands. Three days before the game here’s how many tickets the University of Nevada (Reno) has purchased: 75.\n\nWe wanted to drive around the island but knew that LOST star Michelle Rodriquez was still on the road. 108 is not just the sum total of the “numbers”, it’s her average speed.\n\nHow do they make dippindots?\n\nAnnie received a fortune that said seek professional help.\n\nOne thing I miss: dogs. There is a long quarantine for pets coming over to Hawaii. Concern for the citizens. I say let Fluffy in and keep Michelle Rodriguez locked up for six months.\n\nMy neighbor from across the street is here. It’s the only time I’ve seen her in two years.\n\nWent to Spago’s at the Four Season with writer friends Howard & Karen. We let the kids fend for themselves. A half hour into dinner I get a call from Annie. “Hey, Dad, turn around. Look to your left.” My first thought was “what the fuck are they doing at Spago? This is going to cost me a fortune!” My second thought was “where are they?” I told Annie I didn’t see them. She said, “more to your left. We’re waving.” I still couldn’t see them. Now I’m panicking. Jesus, am I going blind? This went on for two more minutes. Finally she said, “We’re at Longhi’s, have a nice dinner”, they laughed and hung up. I love my children but they’re evil.\n\nSaw KING KONG at the Kihei Cineplex. A sign on the door said “shirts and footwear required”. Bad enough the movie was three hours, it started fifteen minutes late. The projectionist was busy manning the concession counter. The “Aloha Spirit” is a nice way of saying “We wish you would go home”.\n\nWent to a new restaurant called “The Place”. It was a twenty-five minute drive (four for Michelle Rodriguez). The bartender and chef are from the Four Seasons’ Spago. So are the pizza recipes. And it’s right next to the Aquarium so you know the fresh fish is FRESH.\n\nCabana prices have gone up to $200 a day. The most expensive shade in Hawaii. And you can make reservations a year in advance. For only $100 you can reserve cloud cover.\n\nMy wife and daughter decided to skip the bike ride to the bottom of the volcano. Instead they went to Costco.\n\nHard to swim laps in the “adult pool” when there are people standing in the middle of it reading paperbacks. At least they weren’t reading scripts.\n\nPreferred reading material this year: Debby’s shirt. She has a T-shirt filled with stupid quotes our buffoon of a President actually said. Some favorites:\n\n“People say: ‘How can I help on this war against terror? How can I fight evil?’ You can do so by mentoring a child; by going into a shut-in’s house and say – ‘I love you’.\n\n“Natural gas is hemispheric. I like to call it hemispheric because it is a product that we can find in our neighborhoods.”\n\n“We ought to make the pie higher”.\n\n“History?…we don’t know. We’ll all be dead.”\n\n“One of the great things about books is that sometimes there are some fantastic pictures.”\n\n“I’m the master of low expectations”.\n\nAnd finally….”They misunderestimated me”.\n\nA tourist was bitten by a shark 200 yards from our beach. So all beaches along the immediate coast were closed for a day…except the one that fronts the Four Seasons. Guess they figured with all the Hollywood agents there no shark would ever attack – professional courtesy.\n\nGot in an elevator as a woman was pushing the button. She wore a baseball cap with an “L” on it. I asked what the L stood for and she said “lobby”. Do I really look THAT stupid??\n\nThe Aloha Spirit continues: at every Hawaiian airport in addition to the usual TSA inspections (take off your shoes, belt, pull out your computer, remove your pacemaker) they also feature two additional agriculture inspections (one for check-in luggage and one more at the gate for carry on). God forbid a papaya gets into the United States. The terrorists win.\n\nAnd yes, we saw Santa Claus this year. This time in a golf cart tooling around the Maui airport tarmac. So that’s where he gets all his toys and goodies – from all the Hawaiian Airlines luggage that never arrives to you.\n\nChristmas in Palm Springs\n\nAloha. It’s travelogue Friday, sharing some of the goofy travelogues I’ve emailed to friends over the years. At the moment I’m in Hawaii composing a new travelogue you’ll receive next week. But here’s where we were last year. Cast of characters: Debby (wife), Matt (22 year old son), Annie (18 year old daughter). You’ll get to know them.\n\nThe Levines decided on a mere abbreviated trip this holiday season. A long weekend in Palm Springs. Turns out it was just like Hawaii. All those beautiful sandy beaches…but a much farther walk to the ocean.\n\nWe drove down on Christmas Eve. It was my first time on the Sonny Bono Memorial Freeway. Oddly, it was not tree lined.\n\nPassed the new Morongo casino. Matt found it amusing that a casino would have “moron” in its name.\n\nI don’t get the desert. It’s all “Gary Gilmore” country to me. The two big things to do in Palm Springs are play golf or have Sinatra get you laid. So now there’s only one thing.\n\nEasy to tell the locals -- the men wear red polyester pants with white belts and the women dye their hair the color of Huckleberry Hound.\n\nWe stayed at a small resort called 7 Springs. We made the reservations on the ORBITZ website. No wonder we got such a good deal. The hotel knew nothing of our reservations. Even with a confirmation number. That number it seems, simply confirms that they have successfully cashed your deposit. Fortunately the hotel had accommodations that would be available in three hours. I asked why so late? The Christmas Party. Housekeeping is shut down until gift exchange. The 7 Springs is a far cry from the 4 Seasons.\n\nAnd we learned (only upon arrival) that they take pets. And not just little pets either. BIG angry pets. Pets that are not used to being cooped up in hotel rooms. Pets that don’t like the idea of my wife using the pool. Who needs the playful dolphins at the Kahala when you can have surly pit pulls at the 7 Springs?\n\nMatt suggested all guests be issued a tranquilizer gun at check-in.\n\nAnd as luck would have it we were the only guests that did not bring a pet. You know you’re in trouble when one of the room amenities is a pooper scooper.\n\nSince we had three hours to kill while housekeeping played “Silent Santa” we took a stroll down the main drag, Palm Canyon Blvd. This is the Waikiki of Palm Springs. T-shirt shops, tank shirt shops, wife beater shirt shops. Like Hollywood Blvd they have their “walk of fame” with stars in the sidewalk honoring various Palm Springs celebrities. Stars included Liberace (of course), Sandler & Young, Elke Sommer, Rich Little, Kate Ballard, Victoria Principal, Nancy Sinatra (the only female star who didn’t sleep with Sinatra), “Iron Eyes” Cody, cowboy rope trickster Montie Montana (who once performed at my elementary school), and Cheeta “the Chimp” (no foolin’) listed as star of stage, film, TV. Appropriately, his star was right next to Chevy Chase’s. For those who don’t remember, Cheeta was Tarzan’s sidekick in many films and had a brief affair with Maureen O’Sullivan. One star they featured that does not have a corresponding one on Hollywood Blvd is “Borko B. Djordjevic, M.D.—Plastic Surgeon/Humanitarian”. Annie quipped: “Boy, people must’ve been really ugly to have made him a humanitarian.”\n\nLike Sinatra, Bob Hope, and President Eisenhower Cheeta had a compound out here. Actually he’s still there. At 71, Cheeta is the oldest living chimp in captivity. I bet he looks great in red pants with a white belt and still pines for Maureen O’Sullivan.\n\nThere are fifteen Thai restaurants on Palm Canyon Dr. Why??? Considering the mean age of the local population is 106 I can’t imagine there’s that much demand.\n\nOn the other hand, the local “Follies” show does make sense. It’s a big review of music from the 30’s and 40’s performed by people who are 57-87. Matt was a little creeped out by their poster that labeled the show “sexy”. Appearing with the Follies until New Years Eve is Buddy Greco. If Bobby Darin had lived I’m sure that would’ve been his gig. We’ll know next year if Kevin Spacey is the headliner. We didn’t go only because it was dark for the Christmas weekend.\n\nIn Hawaii a big problem is always trying to find a restaurant open on Christmas Eve. No such worries in Palm Springs. I guess because they get JEWS here, but we had no problem getting into the LG Steakhouse on Palm Canyon, conveniently located near the “Crazy Shirt” emporium. On Christmas night we hit the “Great Wall” Chinese restaurant and saw the same Jews we saw the night before at the LG Steakhouse and earlier that day at Sherman’s Deli.\n\nSurprisingly, Sherman’s is quite good. It has to be judging by the autographed celebrity pictures proudly displayed. Kay Ballard, Keely Smith, and Sandler & Young. I guess Cheeta was less enamored with his meal.\n\nWe put our “Do Not Bark” sign out and went to sleep. The beds were quite comfy. It was a relief that 7 Springs did not refer to the mattress.\n\nGoing through the local paper I noticed there were more ads for dermatologists than “after Christmas sales”.\n\nI’m sure if we were at a larger resort we could’ve seen Santa ride in on a moped.\n\nOr gotten maid service. No maid service at the 7 Springs on Christmas. And their complimentary “continental” breakfast consisted of packaged vending machine pastries and kibble.\n\nThere is a Trump 29 casino nearby. Who knew Donald Trump was an Indian?\n\nJacuzzi capacity at the 7 Springs: 8 people, 6 pets.\n\nI wonder if Sinatra ever got Cheeta laid.\n\nThe Art Museum featured selections from the William Holden collection. Probably whiskey bottles from around the world.\n\nThe first two days were clear and cold (but a “dry” cold).\n\nOn Sunday Debby and Annie invaded the outlets at Cabazon (a stunt they wouldn’t even subject contestants to on “Fear Factor”). Matt and I checked out the Spa Casino. It made me long for the now defunct Debbie Reynolds hotel and casino in Laughlin, Nevada. (I always imagined Debbie getting an urgent page, “Come quick, Ms. Reynolds, the toilet in 604 is overflowing”.) A Palm Springs casino means 90% slot machines, maybe fifteen gaming tables, no craps, no sportsbook, video roulette, and aisles wide enough for walkers. But no pets!\n\nIn a pathetic attempt to recreate Hawaii we went to dinner at Roy’s in Rancho Mirage. Rancho Mirage is much classier than Palm Springs. As you drive there on Highway 111 the car dealerships get more upscale.\n\nAll foibles aside, it was great for the family to get together as one even for a few days. (Damn these kids for having their own lives!) Next year Hawaii or the Debbie Reynolds hotel in Laughlin, it really doesn’t matter.\n\nKen Levine\n\nStage/Film/TV/Humanitarian\n\nMy tele-PLAY\n\nAloha again. If you send me email I always try to respond. However, here in Hawaii I'm having a devil of a time reaching anyone on AOL. Doesn't the \"A\" stand for America? Anyway, I'll get to you. Promise.\n\nAfter having gone to New York three times to get shows either on the air or renewed during the Upfronts process I thought “this is INSANITY and there’s a play in this”. So I wrote UPFRONTS AND PERSONAL. It follows one studio’s attempt to get two shows on a network’s fall schedule. I had a reading of the play last summer in LA with Jason Alexander, Wendie Malick, Ed Asner, Kurtwood Smith, Jennifer Tilly, Patrick Breen, and Matt Letscher and it went very well. I’m currently looking for backers (hint hint). Thought you might enjoy a preview and glimpse of what that process is really like.\n\nThe set up: A hotel suite a studio is using as its war room. Very early in the play. Donald is the studio president (Ed Asner), Andy his officious veep (Patrick Breen). Matthew has just arrived (Matt Letscher). He’s the young wide-eyed neophyte writer. Later Gary and Beth will enter. (Jason Alexander & Wendie Malick). They’ve been through the wars.\n\nMATTHEW\n\nHey, let me ask you -- why do they call this process the \"Up Fronts\"?\n\nDONALD\n\nThe networks announce their new Fall schedules then the advertisers buy commercial time \"up front\". Spending billions on nothing more that blind faith. It's like if you put an Off-track betting window in a mental institution.\n\nMATTHEW\n\nWell, I appreciate your letting me do this.\n\nDONALD\n\nHey, you made a helluva pilot. You should be here to defend it. Take a fruit basket. Take four of 'em.\n\nMATTHEW\n\nThanks.\n\n(crossing to the window)\n\nSo...let's check out the view.\n\n(he sees it, disappointed)\n\nOh.\n\nANDY\n\nWe usually have a higher suite but apparently Queen Latifa is in town and she has dogs, and the dogs need to see the sky for some reason we haven't been told so...well, here we are.\n\nDONALD\n\nFeel free to take a dump on the carpet. Fuck 'em.\n\nMATTHEW\n\nWell, there's always the Empire State Building.\n\nANDY\n\nFirst time in New York?\n\nMATTHEW\n\nAre you kidding? Never been out of So-Cal. This is totally unreal. Three years ago I'm working at Kinkos writing scripts at night. And now here I am with my own TV show.\n\n(DONALD takes a big gulp of HIS drink. There's a KNOCK at the door. As ANDY crosses to answer:)\n\nANDY\n\nCome on. It's refreshing. You know what happens to writers after a couple of years.\n\n(ANDY opens the door. GARY NOGLE and BETH HELLER enter. Both are in their 40's. GARY is wiry, always a little revved. BETH is taller than GARY, attractive, bright, and seemingly very much in command. GARY is schlepping a large heavy garment bag.)\n\nGARY\n\nI mean it, Beth. I can't do this anymore. I walked by that idiot in front of the hotel, y'know, the one wearing the big Beefeaters costume and I thought to myself: \"Oh my God, I envy that man. I wish I had his job.\" A Beefeater, Beth! With the hat, and the stick, and the little tights, and...that's when you know it's time to get out.\n\nBETH\n\nSo why did you come?\n\nGARY\n\nWhy do you think? I had to. If we're going to get our damn show renewed they've got to see I'm committed to the fucking thing one hundred percent.\n\nDONALD\n\nThat's what you want -- Talented and trapped.\n\nAloha Oy\n\nIt's become a tradition -- now in its second week -- Friday travelogues...reliving the travel adventures of the Levines which up until now have been reserved for my emailing list and my delusional hope of becoming a book. Since we're heading to Hawaii today I thought I'd share a past Hawaiian vacation from a couple of years ago.\n\nNote one: Internet access providing I will continue to post. And note two: cast of characters -- Debby (wife), Matt (early 20's), and Annie (late teens). Mahalo for reading.\n\nAloha and howzit?\n\nAfter a year's interruption (to rid ourselves of mold and my life savings) the Levines returned again to Hawaii. This year to the Grand Wailea on Maui. Picture Heart's Castle with water slides and a grotto bar. As usual it was glorious. NFL games start at 8 in the morning over there!!!\n\nParis and Nicky Hilton were staying at our hotel. I guess among the many amenities the Grand Wailea offers is a meth lab. (Sure an improvement over Fiona Apple at the Kahala. We got the better anoerexics.) The Four Seasons next door usually has the big Hollywood crowd. Maybe they didn't want Paris. After all, she did make that infamous sex tape...and worse, she has a show on Fox.\n\nOur room was 6091 which was easy to remember because every time we went down for a couple of smoothies the bill was $60.91.\n\nTheir signature restaurant is Humahumanukunukuapua's (actual name). But people call is Humahumanhukunu's for short. Lobster was $59 a pound (again, this is true). They should change the name to Hubrishubrishubrishubrischutzpah.\n\nI forgot to ask Paris how much Maui Wowie was these days.\n\nCabanas were $125 a day and there was a waiting list. But for that money they brought around free fruit and water so it was a bargain. We opted for cosabellas which are lounge chairs with a hood. $40 and a half hour wait in line to sign up. There's a rumor that at the Four Seasons the lines start forming at 4:30 a.m. All the nannies and assistants have to really get up early over there.\n\nNothing more relaxing than turning on the TV and seeing there's a heightened Terror Alert. Yeah, like who would ever want to attack Hawaii?\n\nOne of the many great things about this paradise -- you never hear Paul McCartney's inane \"Having a Wonderful Christmas\" on the radio. Instead they play Paul Anka's \"Christmas in Japan\".\n\nAlthough McCartney was represented. At the art gallery in the next door high end fashion mall a big sign boasts an exhibition of paintings from Paul McCartney, Tony Bennett...and then in much smaller letters, Picasso.\n\nMonday morning Santa Claus arrived on a long canoe bearing candy canes for the kids. He was clad only in a traditional cap and red skirt. The children were confused. Not like any Santa they had ever seen. What I didn't realize until that day was how many tattoos Santa had. Or how scary his heavily-tattooed Samoan elf was. You shouldn't be thinking about the Terror Alert when Santa arrives on shore.\n\nWe spent a lot of time with Jeff Nelson and his family. Jeff is a pitcher for the New York Yankees and we were together in Seattle in the early 90's. He's a rarity. A multi-million dollar ballplayer who actually spends time with his family. Four young daughters and no nannies, no baby-sitters -- just him and his wife Colette.\n\nContrast this with Eric Chavez. The Oakland A player who was also at our digs. Supposedly, his agent, Scott Boros, who was in the middle of trying to make the big Alex Rodriguez blockbuster trade to Boston had to take time out to call the Grand Wailea and request a cabana for Eric. To the hotel's credit they said no. (To the Red Sox credit they said no, too.)\n\nMy son goes to Tufts and has become a big Red Sox fan. Proudly wearing his Red Sox cap. However, when Jeff arrived Matt was reluctant to wear it -- Jeff's pending assault charges in Boston and all. So he ran out to the Gap and got a $4 hat that said \"Est. 1969\". I told him if anyone should ask what \"Est. 1969\" meant just say that was the year \"Tiny Bubbles\" was adopted as the official state song of Hawaii.\n\nTruth is, Jeff could care less. Seriously, he's the sweetest guy in the world (I'm happy to be a character witness) and by Thursday Matt was back to wearing his beloved Red Sox cap. Even took pictures with Jeff while wearing it.\n\nI wanted a picture with me and Paris Hilton where she was wearing nothing but that hat.\n\nHer bodyguard was spotted at the pool Wednesday getting a pedicure. Even during this high Terror Alert.\n\nSpotted on Christmas Eve day, a woman wearing a T-shirt that read in a Hebrew font: Kiss My Tuchas. Gee, why do they hate us??\n\nIt amazes me how many women put on make up to go to the beach. And Botox is very \"in\" this year. But it is keeping with the Hawaiian spirit since they all look like Jack Lord.\n\nWe brought our menorah and lit Chanukah candles. I guess we weren't alone because when I went down to the bar to get matches the waitress said, \"Gee, you're like the ninth person to ask for these. Is there a bonfire somewhere?\" I said no, it was a fireworks convention. In Hawaii they buy that answer.\n\nThe pace on the islands remains blissfully slow. There's a little church on the grounds of the hotel and every morning its chapel bells would ring at 8:10.\n\nYes, I went down a water slide. Matt took a picture. You will never see it.\n\nThis being the busiest season of the year there were lines everywhere...except at the health club. Had no problem getting a treadmaster, no problem finding empty weight machines. The guy selling ice cream dots was mobbed.\n\nWhy is it the fatter the person the louder the Hawaiian shirt? Or the bigger the implants the louder the hair dye?\n\nBook of choice at the Grand Wailea was \"the Da Vinci Code\". At the Four Seasons it was the biography of Lew Wasserman.\n\nThey sell jewelry down at the pool. Women with their guts hanging over their bikini bottoms trying on pearls. I have no idea whether they like the stuff or not. Because of the Botox they can't make an expression.\n\nWent twice to Roy's restaurant. Best food on the island and never disappoints. And the view? Spectacular. Roy's is in the parking lot of a shopping center. You know you're in Hawaii when you see the crimson sun set behind the Safeway and the Crazy Shirt Emporium.\n\nCommercial seen during Hawaiian newscast: a new retirement village featuring golf, recreation, pools, and year round sunshine...in Florida.\n\nA Levine Christmas day tradition is to go to a movie. So we ventured into Kihae. First was dinner at Tony Romas where we were the only table to not order a five-pound onion loaf. Then to the cineplex to see \"Paycheck\". It's McGyver meets Memento. The Hawaiians who sat behind Annie and Matt were completely baffled. Bad enough there was the concept of time travel, they were just thrown because everyone in the movie was wearing long pants.\n\nHow Hollywood is Maui these days? There are academy screenings at the Castle Theatre. (No joke) Just show your DGA, WGA, or academy cards at the door.\n\nMatt just turned 21 and loves being carded since he's now legal. There's a swim-up Grotto Bar and he wondered if he'd be carded there (and if so just where do they think he'd keep ID). So as an experiment he and Annie swam up to it, he ordered a White Russian and was served no problem. Annie ordered an Oreo smoothie and the bartender asked \"You want any booze in that?\" Annie is 17.\n\nDebby had a hot rock massage. That's where the masseuse puts hot relaxing rocks on your back then sits off to the side silently chuckling and reading magazines.\n\nBut all in all another spectacular trip. The weather was perfect. And we got out just in time. Beginning today they're predicting four days of torrential downpours. I guess it's God saying to that woman \"Kiss MY tuchas!\"\n\nHappy holidays and I leave you with this:\n\nA' ohe 'ai pani 'ia o ka 'amo.\n\n(no particular food blocks the anus).\n\nThe Best of the Golden Globes\n\nOh boy!! The Golden Globes have been announced. Each year for my friends I review the major award shows and the Golden Globes (except last year when I slept through them). So in honor of the nominations I thought I’d take you back to happier times – the 2004 Golden Globes, when Dick Clark was still producing and enjoying the relaxing music of KOST. Before housewives and cowboys were desperate. Before Ziyi Zhang became a star and household name.\n\nIt's the lid lifter to the 2004 Awards season, beginning with the show where the awards can be bought -- the Golden Globes. Winners are selected by the \"foreign Press\" meaning your busboys at Jerry's Deli. To put the Golden Globes in perspective, Pia Zadora won one. Jaimie Lee Curtiss once threw a big brunch at her house for the \"Foreign Press\" and copped a best actress award.\n\nSir Laurence Olivier at one time won a Golden Globe which literally broke in his hand during his acceptance speech.\n\nAnd they are presented at a hotel owned by Merv Griffin and televised tape delayed to Hollywood with Dick Clark as producer. All meals are prepared on a George Foreman grill.\n\nThe big incentive for stars to attend is that they do provide dinner. And they can thank the busboys for voting for them.\n\nThe big attraction for the audience is that both movies and television are represented. And Charlie Sheen doesn't host (like the People's Choice Awards which is the Golden Globes with Jamie Cromwell as the biggest movie star)\n\nThree weeks ago I was in that same ballroom to attend a gala dinner honoring the Chairman of Fox Television. Two days later he was fired. It's clearly where Hollywood goes to express its sincere gratitude.\n\nWhere else can you see Clint Eastwood and the Queer Eye guys considered peers?\n\nAlways glad to see Barbra Streisand...when she doesn't have to talk. And I loved her sheepskin gown. Last worn by Sonny Bono in 1965. Notice how they showed Babs on camera fifty times and her husband (a nominee) maybe twice?\n\nGreat that Anthony LaPaglia won...on NBC. This is the same network that refused to approve him for the co-starring role in the short-lived comedy, KRISTIN. Judging by the shot of his wife falling out of her dress, he already has two golden globes.\n\nWhen Francis Conroy is not the most obscure actor to win an award you know you're in trouble.\n\nOther than Rene Zellweger, none of the other Best Supporting Actresses were in movies that played anywhere other than the Laemelle. What a surprise that she won. The FP loves her. She eats out a lot.\n\nWhen Rene Zellweger actually thanks the guy who makes sure she doesn't lose anything in her purse then you know these people are taking themselves just a tad too seriously.\n\nI was happy THE OFFICE won. So what if 99% of the audience has never heard of it? Just from the ten second clip they deserved to beat the other nominees. WILL & GRACE put its best foot forward with a vagina joke. And ARRESTED DEVELOPMENT made fun of hispanic housekeepers. Considering that's the Foreign Press it's no wonder they lost.\n\nDo seat fillers get to eat the meals of the people they’re substituting for?\n\nJessica Lange's hair looked like a Monet haystack.\n\nThe theme this year was \"lessons\". Every actor learned a \"lesson\" from either their director or family or guy who made sure they didn't lose anything in their purse.\n\nSarah Jessica Parker looked like she was wearing the Liberty Bell. Best Actress in a Comedy? What a list of Lucys. Debra Messing. Bonnie Hunt. Some girl from MONK. Alicia Silverstone. Sarah beat out the best.\n\nI'm sorry Diane Lane lost. Stop blaming her for JUDGE DREDD.\n\nHow many times did you scream \"Get Off!!!\" during actors' acceptance speeches? I stopped counting at ten.\n\nDiane Keaton actually prepared that hideous, rambling, incoherent speech of hers. We get it. You're old.\n\nBest speech -- no wait, ONLY good speech: Bill Murray's.\n\nGlad “24” won. Quite a few people from the show got up to accept. One was a mole. But whom???\n\nQuick: name the winner of the Best Actor in a Television Comedy. Hint: He stars in THE OFFICE. Another hint: Ricky Gervais. Any ideas?\n\nYou can't say Eric McCormack was robbed. I forget whether he delivered the vagina joke or it was one of the other over-actors.\n\nJaimie Lee Curtiss should have hosted a brunch this year. But it's an honor just to be nominated.\n\nPacino is starting to look like Frank Zappa. And sound like him. What the hell was his speech about? Even he got lost. I was impressed however, that he acknowledged his twins and actually knew their names.\n\nThe gowns were by and large simple and elegant. I have one suggestion for Rene Zellweger: sleeves!!\n\nWhen you watched the Michael Douglas tribute montage didn't you say \"God, he's gotten old?\" Highlight of the night for me was seeing Karl Malden. I'm happy Michael received that award because as part of his pre nup with Catherine Zeta-Jones if he didn't win the Cecil B. DeMille Award she was entitled to another million dollars of his money when they split.\n\nTHE LORD OF THE RINGS TRILOGY did so well I say it's time for a sequel.\n\nPeter Jackson, its director, forgot to thank the talking tree.\n\nCan you imagine if Sofia Coppola had beaten out Peter Weir, Peter Jackson, and Clint Eastwood? Notice how Jackson acknowledged all of his fellow nominees except Coppola? So Coppola and the talking tree both got dissed.\n\nNicole Kidman looked like Dorothy Provine in THE ROARING 20's. I'm only sorry that Tom Cruise didn't win because I would love to have seen her have to present the award to him.\n\nAfghanistan wins but SIX FEET UNDER loses again.\n\nAll five Best Actress nominees were blondes. The foreign press loves that exotic American look.\n\nCharlize Theron won for a great performance. Who knew she could play ugly?\n\nMelanie Griffith has crossed into middle age. Oh...and get a babysitter next year, Mel.\n\nFor the eleventh straight awards show Jim Carrey wasn't funny. And for the eleventh straight awards show he thought he killed.\n\nLOST IN TRANSLATION -- Best COMEDY??? Good movie but excuse me, aren't comedies supposed to be funny? I guess when you work the back sink at Jerry's nothing is funny.\n\nOkay....so bring on the real award shows – like SAG and the Patsys!\n\nDo not try this at home!\n\nI have read some bad specs in my time and now offer some suggestions of what not to do based on actual scripts I have read…or at least attempted to read.\n\nDon’t view the show from the perspective of a fly. I once read a WINGS spec as seen by a buzzing fly. I offer this as the first example because I know so many young writers fall into this same trap.\n\nDon’t put yourself into the show and make yourself the lead character. I once read a CHEERS where Alan had more lines than Sam & Diane combined. Alan? Who’s Alan? Alan was one of the extras. And so he remained.\n\nAnd just because people tell you you look like Debra Messing doesn’t mean you should write a WILL & GRACE entitled “Grace’s Sister”. If I get a script with a photo attached I know I’m in trouble.\n\nDon’t hand write your script, no matter how good your penmanship. Send your spec in a UCLA blue book and you’ll get an F.\n\nDon’t invent a format.\n\nKnow the characters. I read a spec MARY TYLER MOORE SHOW where Mary wondered what to get her husband for his birthday. Her “husband”???!\n\nKeep in mind the production parameters. A MASH I once read featured this:\n\nEXT. YANKEE STADIUM – DAY\n\nHawkeye is on the mound during the World Series. 60,000 people cheer.\n\nHuh????? Ask yourself the following question: Can anybody other than Peter Jackson or James Cameron make this? And if the answer is no, especially for a multi-camera show that takes place in a living room, then don’t do it.\n\nSimilarly, avoid dream sequences. The GEORGE LOPEZ SHOW is not looking for the next Fellini.\n\nDon’t hinge your show on stunt casting. I read a BECKER where former President Jimmy Carter came in for a check-up and offered dating advice. Yeah, President Carter gets his physicals in the Bronx. And yeah, President Carter is always available to guest on a sitcom and advise a character to say whatever is necessary to get laid.\n\nDon’t change the characters’ reality to fit your story. Ray Barone is not Jewish. THAT’S why he can’t have a bar mitzvah.\n\nI was going to recommend you don’t do like one aspiring writer and make a joke in a CHEERS about Diane’s pussy because it’s crude, offensive, and inappropriate, but I saw the same joke two weeks ago on STACKED.\n\nStill, I’d like to think there is some line of decorum and taste left. I once read a NEWSRADIO where the story was the Dave Foley character comes into his office in the morning and discovers a semen stain on his couch. Then the episode went downhill.\n\nDon’t marry off any of the main characters.\n\nDon’t kill off any of the main characters.\n\nDon’t go the first ten pages before doing a joke. This even applies to many drama specs.\n\nDon’t do the “supersize” hour episode.\n\nThe last sentence in your script should not be “To Be Continued”.\n\nDon’t include a cover letter telling the producer that you sent him a copy of the script months ago and that he was shirking his responsibility by not reading it. Our agent did this once and trust me, David Lloyd was not amused.\n\nAnd finally, avoid this ploy: I once received a spec MASH with a note that read “This script was written by my brother. On his way to the post office to mail it he was hit by a car and killed. I’m sure he would have wanted you to read it anyway. P.S. If you want any changes I can make them.” He received a touching rejection sympathy card.\n\nJust remember this, when producers read your script they want to like it. They want to discover the next Larry Gelbart. It only helps them. Don’t shoot yourself in the foot by doing something stupid like relying on Jimmy Carter to get your laughs.\n\nMy Spec is Earl\n\nI’m often asked “what’s the best spec script to submit?” I can only speak for comedies. For dramas I say cover all your bases and do a CSI: DEADWOOD. There is no hard and fast rule but I, and most sitcom producers I know, prefer scripts of existing shows over pilots. We want to see how well you can write other people’s characters and fit into other people’s styles. That’s what you’ll be faced with if you get an assignment.\n\nSo then the question is “what show do I pick?” Not HOPE & FAITH. Select a current show you like and think you know the best. “Current” is the key word here. Once a show is cancelled the shelf life for your spec is about six months. So don’t start that ARRESTED DEVELOPMENT you’ve been developing. And I hope you didn’t pour a lot of time and effort into a spec KITCHEN CONFIDENTIAL. When RAYMOND went off the air everyone was sad but show runners. No more reading fifty RAYMONDS a day when trying to staff! And for that same reason, please let this be WILL & GRACE’S last year! The good news is if you’ve got a spec FRASIER you can just change the names and send it out as an OUT OF PRACTICE. And of course you never have to worry with a SIMPSONS because they will go on making new episodes forever.\n\nYou do not have to write an episode of the show you’re submitting to. STILL STANDING will read KING OF QUEENS and vice versa. In fact, it’s tougher to sell a spec of the show you’re submitting to because they know that show so well. On the other hand, you could make up the names of the YES, DEAR characters and most show runners wouldn’t know the difference. But be careful. The show runners need to at least have heard of the show. For that reason I wouldn’t recommend specing a RODNEY.\n\nHere are a few other things to consider: The SIMPSONS and FAMILY GUY might really show off your funny but they’re cartoons. That might hurt your chances of getting an assignment on a live show, unless it’s a live cartoon show like MALCOLM. CURB YOUR ENTHUSIASM allows you to push the envelope but the dialogue is improvised. There is no such thing as a real CURB YOUR ENTHUSIASM script. So your spec might feel a little artificial. Of course you could always just write “Larry does something funny here” but I wouldn’t recommend it.\n\nUnfortunately, there are not a lot of great shows out there at the moment. What I think we’ll see this year is everybody writing a MY NAME IS EARL. It’s clearly the best of the new crop. The only caution I give you is that EVERYBODY will be writing one. If that doesn’t concern you (or you’ve written it already) I say go for it. If it does then some suitable alternates might be SCRUBS, TWO AND A HALF MEN, EVERYBODY HATES CHRIS, or HOW I MET YOUR MOTHER (a far cry from the CHEERS, TAXI, MASH, COSBY days).\n\nThen there are the hour sorta-comedies. DESPERATE HOUSEWIVES, BOSTON LEGAL, HOUSE (when patients aren’t going into spasms). These all have very specific tones. Hard to nail but if you do it could be a home run.\n\nBut at the end of the day it still is which show best fits your voice and sensibility? Good luck, and just so you know – the characters on YES, DEAR are Greg, Kim, Christine, and Jimmy. And the main character on RODNEY is Rodney.\n\nMore later.\n\nChristmastime in Vegas\n\nI’m beginning a new feature. Actually, my first feature. TRAVELOGUE FRIDAYS (even if I post them late Thursdays). One of the reason for doing this blog is to attract attention to travelogues I’ve written for my email buddies over the years and hope to compile one day for a book. (I know – what a whore). So starting this week I’ll post one every Friday.\n\nTomorrow night I’m going to see Linda Eder in concert at the Wilshire theatre. She’s an incredible singer, a thirteen time STAR SEARCH winner and it’s a testament to the power of that show that you probably still haven’t heard of her. Last year at this time, my wife and I took a little trip to see her. Here’s my account of that weekend:\n\nDeb and I just got back from a brief weekend in Las Vegas, or, as I like to call it, \"Three Card Monty for the Red States\". Many big attractions there this holiday weekend. The annual rodeo, the Anti-Aging conference, the Jose Luis Castillo/Joel Casamayer title bout. But we were there to see Linda Eder. Ms. Eder is a spectacular singer -- Barbra Streisand but at affordable prices and you never have to suffer through \"Evergreen\". We've become friends with her manager, Dave, who graciously invited us to join him for her concert. Since we likely would have gone to Vegas for Christmas anyway, we gladly accepted.\n\nStayed at the Mandalay Bay. Dave is also a VP of something for the House of Blues (who knows more about the blues than the Jews?) and arranged for us to get a room on the \"House of Blues\" floor. It had the two things Debby and I require in a hotel room -- a fabulous view and voodoo decor.\n\nI'm not joking about the annual Anti-Aging conference. But am I the only one who finds it odd to hold an Anti-Aging conference in the one place where people stay up all hours drinking, gorging, smoking, and enduring the enormous stress of losing their money? I guess it's held there out of respect for Joan Rivers. My feeling is if the President of the Anti-Aging organization isn't 117 then it's a sham.\n\nHad dinner Friday night at Rumjungle in the hotel. Very classy. Girls dance in cages above your head. To me that is classy. To Vegas it's positively elegant.\n\nInteresting crowd at the hotel because of all the special events. A lot of shitkickers (I assume for either the rodeo or \"Mama Mia\") and the prizefight attracted several hundred Ruben Studdards decked out in jewelry and Oakland Raider sweatsuits. Rode in an elevator with one -- a mean looking dude in black sunglasses. He said, \"you here for the fuckin' fight, man?\" I sheepishly had to say \"No, the Linda Eder concert\". I'm lucky I'm still alive.\n\nThis week a boxing title match, next week an ice spectacular featuring American Idol loser Diana DeGarmo.\n\nThe headliner at the hotel was Larry the Cable Guy. If Shecky Green were dead he'd be rolling in his grave.\n\nAnd as I said, a full Broadway production of \"Mama Mia\", not to mention a separate \"Mama Mia\" STORE. Someone had a great line about Abba. It's like being hit in the head with Ikea furniture. You appreciate the craftmanship but it hurts.\n\nI won $20 in blackjack. Debby lost $.55 in the slots. I doubt if we'll be comped the next trip.\n\nI think there were Christmas lights and decorations up all over town. Who could tell?\n\nThe waitresses were all attractive with massive chests. If there was a flood on the casino floor they would float to the surface.\n\nThe most beautiful girl I saw there was a parking valet attendant bundled in a heavy coat. If she got a boob job I'm sure she could get an inside job. Maybe Santa will be good to her.\n\nNext day we hit the beach. Yes, Mandalay Bay has it's own beach. Unfortunately, the ocean was turned off. No waves. But Debby and I took a long walk along the grid that serves as the shore and gazed out at the horizon to see the Lance Burton Magician billboard on Las Vegas Avenue.\n\nFrom there we hotel hopped. Had to stop in at the Excalibur -- a casino in Sleeping Beauty's castle. This is home to the black socks, shorts, and wife beater shirt crowd. You know you're in trouble when they have a special parking lot just for motorhomes. Handing a pair of dice to one of these idiots is like handing a gun to a monkey.\n\nThen on to the Bellagio, where Debby and I checked out the Monet exhibit at their fine arts gallery. (How can you go to Vegas and not stop in a museum??) I imagine when most of the tourists saw the ad for the exhibit they said, \"Hey, they spelled money wrong!\" The paintings were glorious and it was just nice to be in the only room in Las Vegas where everybody voted for Kerry. I can only imagine the paintings Monet himself would have made had he been to Las Vegas. \"The Imperial Palace as seen from the Luxor\".\n\nThe highlight of the trip was the Linda Eder concert. It's the third time I've seen her. I realize that if I see her one more time I'm officially gay. But I don't care. That will happen in March when she performs in Northridge. The only problem was that her concert hall was impossible to find. It's somewhere on the UNLV campus -- the Jerry Tarkanian Music Hall, or something like that -- and even cab drivers have no idea where this is. Dave and I set out for the sound check. The venue is five minutes from our hotel but we wound up somewhere near the Mustang Ranch. The only map on how to get there was on the ticket envelope you pick up at the box office. But we ultimately found it and the concert was wonderful. Celine Dion can't carry her Chloraseptic.\n\nHeaded home early this morning. McLaren airport is the worst in the country re security checks. You actually DO have to allow two hours. It's bad enough you have to remove your shoes, but the spurs must come off too and that takes some time.\n\nAnd now we're home, shopping for voodoo wallpaper."
