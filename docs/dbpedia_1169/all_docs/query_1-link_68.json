        "text": "According to Cinema & Radio Comic Lew Lehr, a German refugee named Meyer, never in the U. S. before, was met at a Manhattan pier by ship news reporters. Said he,right off the bat: \"How happy I am a-a-awrk to be at last in your beautiful America sque-e-e-e, to live in peace and freedom bukabukabuk without fear of concentration camps ow-o-o-o-ow, to raise my children to know the full meaning of mental and physical liberty kre-e-e-sh, I can hardly wait to set foot on your happy shores whe-e-e-e!\"\n\n\"But Mr. Meyer,\" queried one reporter, \"you have never been in our country before, yet you handle the language astonishingly. Where did you pick it up?\"\n\nSaid Mr. Lehr's Mr. Meyer, with understandable pride: \"From your short-wave radio.\"\n\n(this scintillating anecdote devoted\n\nto Joe Milutis, yr sundance naval radio POET)\n\nso the radiopathic mr. mr.\n\nthe 30s megastar of the newsreel industry\n\nclaims the airwaves\n\n(a pretty marvelous gem to troll up\n\nfrom the depths of interwebbing time-space vortex\n\nlet me here redirect readers to the fabulous j.h c craven favorite bert lahr)\n\nso here's more +source:\n\nComedian best known for his narration on the Fox Movietone newsreel novelty segments, usually with a reference to:\n\nMonkeys is the cwaziest peoples !\n\nAs noted, the odd error can creep in: some typos, some discs that donât qualify even as peripheral (Les Benson's \"Borsht Belt Blues\" somehow got included along with Lew Lehrâs stories listed under Manor). These are insignificant problems in a book lavishly illustrated in full colour on every page and printed on top quality paper (HEAVY paper!), and priced at a reasonable US$25.\n\n[ps on pic below-right: WTF? see related story at time Refugag page]\n\nVarious cartoons have Lehr caricatures or people doing the Lehr schtick. These include: She Was an Acrobats Daughter (Freleng, 1937), which has a caricature of Lehr; Russian Rhapsody (Clampett, 1944), where Adolf Hitler says: Nazis is the cwaziest peoples!; Porky in Egypt (Clampett, 1938) done by the Camel; and Daffy Duck Hunt (McKimson, 1949), said by Daffy at the very beginning. Porky does a Lew Lehr imitation as he narrates a novelty bit in Porkys Snooze Reel (Clampett/McCabe, 1941).\n\nMarch 6, 1950 in History\n\nLew Lehr, comedian (Stop Me if I heard this One), dies at 54\n\nBetween 1937 and 1948, he was caricatured in six Warner Bros. animated cartoons: \"She Was An Acrobat's Daughter\" (1937), \"Porky in Egypt\" (1938), \"The Sour Puss\" (1940), \"Russian Rhapsody\" (1944), \"Herr Meets Hare\" (1945), and \"Scaredy Cat\" (1948).[1]\n\nThis is a good place to point out an error in 'Who Framed Roger Rabbit'. During the scene in which Roger and Eddie visit a cinema in 1940s Los Angeles, Roger Rabbit (who is only interested in funny stuff) protests that he hates newsreels. Whoever wrote that line had no knowledge of what a trip to the movies was like in the 1940s. A typical newsreel ended with a funny afterpiece ... in fact, one very popular movie comedian (Lew Lehr) had a long successful career specialising as a performer in the humour sequences at the end of serious newsreels. (Lehr's 'news' footage often depicted monkeys imitating some human activity.) What Roger Rabbit really should have said was: 'Newsreels? I only like the funny part at the end!'\n\nI'll rate 'The Boob Weekly' 3 points for good intentions and one more point for execution. I'm a fan of Rube Goldberg, but he did his best and funniest work in newspapers, not movies.\n\nLew Lehr and Durante crack each other up and have trouble reading their lines. The system cue has been deleted.\n\nHe was also the editor, writer and commentator for Fox Movietone News, beginning in 1932, for the sequences within their newsreels called \"The Dribble-Puss Parade\". Whatever the subject, Lew Lehr's character had a sardonic and slightly-sour outlook on it, especially when it involved footage from old Edison films that Fox Movietone News would insert about once a month to lighten up their Newsreels. In 1946, he wrote, edited and starred in a stand-alone series of \"Drizzle Puss Parade(s)\", distributed by 20th Century-Fox, that usually found him casting a jaded eye on various activities he found in his travels around the United States. The man's voice and/or face was heard and/or seen in at least 300 shorts or newsreels for over 25 years beginning in 1932.

The story was already a corker: the five baby pitbull terriers McKinney was showing off had been cloned in Korea from the ear of her late and much-missed pet Booger, who'd once saved her from an attack by another dog that had practically ripped McKinney's arm off.\n\nBut the story got even better when newspaper suspicions proved true and McKinney was forced to admit she was none other than Joyce McKinney, the former Miss Wyoming who 30 years ago fled Britain to escape charges of kidnapping a Mormon missionary and forcibly having sex with him.\n\nBritons over a certain age will recall with a shudder the surreal and sexy details of that story from the winter of 1977. The 27-year-old McKinney was accused in court, along with a friend, Keith May, of abducting 21-year-old Mormon missionary Kirk Anderson from a church in a London suburb and taking him to a cottage in Okehampton, Devon in the southwest of England. There, said Anderson, he was chained to a bed and forced to have sex with McKinney for three days. McKinney, once a Mormon herself, was said to have formed a crush on him after they'd first met and had sex in 1975. Anderson tried to break off the relationship but McKinney was infatuated and stalked him to England where he'd asked for a posting as a missionary to escape her attentions.\n\nThe story was gift-wrapped for Britain's tabloid press and the \"Mormon Sex Slave\" case held the country agog as Anderson and McKinney gave their versions of what went on in the idyllic Devon cottage to a court assembled to decide whether McKinney had a case to answer. McKinney claimed that she was trying to rekindle her affair with Anderson using techniques of seduction recommended by Alex Comfort, author of that redolent manual of the day, The Joy of Sex.\n\nMcKinney told the court that the chains, fur-lined manacles, rope, chloroform and wedding trousseau complete with \"pink feathers and see-through nighties\" were all props for the bondage sessions she planned for McKinnon. \"We had such a fun time â just like old times,\" McKinney told the court in her native North Carolina drawl. \"I love him so much that I would ski naked down Mount Everest with a carnation up my nose if he asked me to,\" she added. Such sexual frankness rather stuck out in a magistrates court in sedate, suburban Surrey, England, in those days.\n\nFor his part, Anderson claimed that he'd been kidnapped at gunpoint (albeit a replica), forced to have sex while chained to the bed (and twice more unchained), and that, despite being six foot four and 240 lbs. (110 kg), had never resisted. \"I had made a plan for my release,\" Anderson testified, \"but it wasn't through running away. I was going to cooperate.\" Even after his ordeal, when McKinney and May drove him back to London and a long lunch in Trafalgar Square, he still cooperated.\n\nAfter deliberating, the Surrey magistrates decided that McKinney and May should stand trial on kidnap charges but granted McKinney bail. Outside the court she declared her innocence, regaled the press with the promise that they'd heard nothing yet and walked off, tossing over her shoulder, \"You can have my life story for twenty-five thousand!\" But in April 1978, a month before her trial was due to begin, McKinney and May fled the country.\n\nThe police and media both chased after, with British tabloids competing to find McKinney, making do in the meantime with pictures and revelations about her former career as a nude model for sex magazines. When reporters ran McKinney and May to ground in Atlanta, Georgia a month later, the couple revealed how they'd used a succession of disguises â first as nuns, then in a sari and Sinbad the Sailor outfit.\n\nIn July, 1979, the FBI finally caught up with the couple in Asheville, North Carolina, where they got suspended sentences for falsifying passports but were not considered liable for extradition. In 1984, McKinney surfaced again, when she was arrested outside the office of Kirk Anderson in Salt Lake City where he was living. Police found rope and handcuffs in her car.\n\nIn Seoul, as she prepared to return home with one of her brand new Boogers, Bernann McKinney initially denied that she is one and the same Joyce McKinney who is still technically a fugitive from British justice. But confronted by the weight of circumstantial evidence â Joyce McKinney's middle name is Bernann, both are former beauty queens, both owned pitbulls and even appear to share the same social security number, birth date and home address â Bernann McKinney confessed to being a reinvention rather than a clone of her former self. \"I thought people would be honest enough to see me as a person who was trying to do something good and not as a celebrity,\" a tearful McKinney told the Associated Press in a phone call. Ignoring the fact that police in her hometown of Newland, Avery County in North Carolina still want to talk to her about various other charges on file from recent years, McKinney still proclaims her innocence and calls her capers of 30 years ago \"a figment of the tabloid press ... I don't want that garbage in with the puppy story.\"\n\nThis is an updated version of a story that originally appeared on Friday August 8, 2008\n\n&now;\n\na poem for LZ:\n\nVerification Status\n\nReference Status Come shadow, come, and take this shadow up, Not Verified Come shadow shadow, come and take this up, Not Verified Come, shadow, come, and take this shadow up, Not Verified Come, come shadow, and take this shadow up, Not Verified Come, come and shadow, take this shadow up, Not Verified Come, up, come shadow and take this shadow, Not Verified Come, up, come shadow and take this shadow, Not Verified And up, come, come shadow, take this shadow, Not Verified And come shadow, come up, take this shadow, Not Verified Come up, come shadow this, and take shadow, Not Verified Up, shadow this, come and take shadow, come Not Verified Shadow this, take and come up shadow, come Not Verified\n\nTake and come, shadow, come up, shadow this,Not Verified Up, come and take shadow, come this shadow,Not Verified Come up, take shadow, and come this shadow,Not Verified Come and take shadow, come up this shadow,Not Verified Shadow, shadow come, come and take this up,Not Verified Come, shadow, take, and come this shadow, up,Not Verified Come shadow, come, and take this shadow up,Not Verified Come, shadow, come, and take this shadow up.Not Verified\n\nbetter! -- hear the original, a momentous discovery from the depths of the LZ poetry archive (i've been editing, more words shortly! -- it's'll be a prodigious resource.. .) : : a disastrously reverby 1966 recording of Come Shadow, Come from the NET USA poetry series made-for-TV zukofsky program.. .
