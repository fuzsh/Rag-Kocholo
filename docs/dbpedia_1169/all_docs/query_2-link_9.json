        "text": "''X,'' a new opera about Malcolm X by the family team of Anthony Davis (music), Thulani Davis (libretto) and Christopher Davis (story), received its semi/sort-of world premiere Wednesday night at Walnut Street Theater here, part of the American Music Theater Festival.\n\nThis was the first full-scale, full-length performance of ''X,'' but it was listed as ''the final stage in the development of this work prior to its world premiere at the New York City Opera in September 1986.'' It might have seemed that Beverly Sills had raided the Philadelphia festival to win the prestige of the premiere. But after Wednesday's performance, it may be that 11 months' more time is just what Anthony Davis needs. There are remarkable things about ''X''; it has the makings of a great American opera. But there are correctable flaws in its construction.\n\nApart from Malcolm, a Sportin' Life-type character called Street and Elijah Muhammad, all the many other characters fade into background stereotypes. In addition, some of the text falls awkwardly between realism, doctrine and poetry (a Reporter asks Malcolm: ''Are you not the one/who set in motion/rampaging youth/in the streets?''). On the other hand, Malcolm's life was an extraordinary one, the issues it raises are just as alive today as they ever were, and by and large Christopher and Thulani Davis have told it well, using static, archetypal scenes that work decently on their own terms.\n\nMr. Davis's music, on the whole, succeeds estimably, sustaining interest over a three-hour span (with one intermission); this is, in fact, as successful a ''third stream'' score as this writer has ever heard. Classically trained at Yale but best known as a vanguard jazz pianist and band-leader (his group, Episteme, is incorporated into the ''X'' orchestra), Mr. Davis writes seamless operatic music that partakes of a wide variety of jazz and black popular idioms without ever lapsing inertly into any of them. The vocal lines tend toward the declamatory, with occasional clumsy text-setting but without the extreme chromaticism of modernist opera. And the stylistic eclecticism almost always makes good dramatic sense."
