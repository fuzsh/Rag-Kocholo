        "text": "Vassar Today\n\n“Small but Mighty”\n\nVassar Earns Campus Housing Award\n\nThe Association of College and University Housing Officers–International (ACUHO-I) provides resources, support, and programming for more than 17,000 residence life professionals on more than 900 campuses on five continents. For the second year in a row, Vassar has been recognized for outstanding contributions to the organization and the profession.\n\nCurrent ACUHO-I President Leon McClinton presented the President’s Service Award to the College at the organization’s annual convention this summer in Portland, OR. Luis Inoa, Dean of the College for Residential Life and Wellness, right, accepted the award for the College and collected accolades of his own. Having earned the President’s Individual Award for service to ACUHO-I last year, this year Inoa was the recipient of the James A. Hurd Award, which recognizes outstanding contributions by a professional of color.\n\nInoa serves as Co-Chair for the Future of the Profession, Supporting Mental Health imperative and is the incoming chair of the Small Colleges and Universities Network. Yetty Marquez-Santana, Vassar’s Director of Residential Education, who also attended the event, serves as ACUHO-I’s Director of Inclusion and Equity.\n\nAs he announced the award, McClinton referred to Vassar as “a small but mighty college in the northeast that has become a tried-and-true friend of ACUHO-I. My thanks go out to Vassar for sharing these talented individuals with us and serving as a model for what an engaged member institution looks like.”\n\n“You don’t do this work to earn an award,” Inoa concluded, “but to be recognized by our peers puts Vassar on the map as a small college that does lots of good work.” —Larry Hertz\n\nRenowned Filmmaker and Cinematographer on Success in the Biz\n\nAcclaimed filmmaker and cinematographer Ellen Kuras spoke about the groundbreaking work she has done on several major Hollywood motion pictures during a conversation with Professor of Film Mia Mask on September 30 in the Martel Theater. The talk was presented under the auspices of the Capotorto and Mulas Family Distinguished Lecture in Film. Kuras’s work includes her Emmy-award-winning and Oscar-nominated documentary Betrayal and critically acclaimed feature films Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind, Blow, and Spike Lee’s Bamboozled and Summer of Sam. Kuras told the audience that her work required commitment and passion. “But [filmmaking] isn’t a competition; it’s a collaboration,” she added. “The person who brings you coffee on the set is just as important as everyone else, and I try to lead by example.” Kuras advised them to “learn your craft, but never feel entitled. It’s a privilege to be there, so treat people with kindness. There’s a timbre in the industry toward bullying, but part of my success has come from treating people kindly. It doesn’t cost anything to be kind.” —Larry Hertz\n\nThe Society for Historians of American Foreign Relations awarded Robert K. Brigham, Professor of History on the Shirley Ecker Boskey Chair, the Peter L. Hahn Distinguished Service Award at its annual meeting in June. The award recognizes a senior historian who has provided significant contributions to the growth and development of the organization over the course of their career. Honorees demonstrate “a deep commitment to the organization’s mission of promoting and disseminating scholarship in the field of foreign relations broadly defined as well as its distinguished tradition of mentorship, teaching, and public advocacy (especially as it relates to the declassification of government documents).”\n\nVassar Today\n\nGrants in Action!\n\nGame-Changing Microscope to Benefit Vassar and Other Local Colleges\n\nFollow\n\nFollow\n\nFollow\n\nVassar has received a grant from the National Science Foundation to purchase a one-million-dollar, state-of-the-art microscope that will significantly enhance faculty and student research opportunities at Vassar and other nearby colleges. The proposal for this custom-made research tool was submitted by Hadley Bergstrom, Associate Professor in the Psychological Science Department and the Neuroscience and Behavior Program, and a team of faculty from Vassar as well as Marist and SUNY New Paltz.\n\nThe Leica Stellaris 8 is a next-generation confocal microscope that will transform faculty and student research opportunities at Vassar and other Mid-Hudson regional colleges. It is scheduled for delivery in December and is expected to be fully operational for research projects across multiple disciplines by spring, said Bergstrom, who lead a multiyear proposal submission process.\n\n“Twelve faculty members in five departments contributed to writing the grant proposal,” Professor Bergstrom said. “That demonstrates just how much this microscope will be used. It’s a real workhorse that we will use in our day-to-day teaching as well as in our research.”\n\nProfessor Zupan said she was looking forward to using the new microscope in student-led projects in her lab. “Imaging with the old microscope is so time-consuming—it takes 90 minutes to perform a procedure that will take eight minutes on the new one,” Professor Zupan said. “With its capacity to complete more projects more quickly, the new microscope will enable more students to be trained on confocal microscopy techniques, which will hopefully make them more excited about participating in research. This acquisition is a real game-changer for a lot of us.”\n\nAssociate Professor of Biology Jennifer Kennell, who co-wrote the grant proposal with Bergstrom and Associate Professor of Psychological Science Bojana Zupan, said the grant calls for Vassar to share the use of the microscope with other college faculty and students in the region. This collaboration is consistent with ongoing Vassar faculty collaborations with science faculty at other institutions in the Hudson Valley.\n\nMembers of the science faculty at two local colleges said they were also looking forward to using the microscope for their research. “This [microscope] will be a real community resource,” said Megan Dennis, Associate Professor of Biology at Marist College.\n\nLydia Bright, Professor of Biology at SUNY New Paltz, said she was eager to use Vassar’s new acquisition for her own research. “I look at live cells and need to see how proteins move around, and this microscope is ideal for my work,” Bright said. She said she planned to bring some of her students to Vassar as well. “It will be good for them to see some cutting-edge technology that they may encounter in grad school or later in their careers,” she said. “It will be good for them to be able to say that they have used this kind of technology.”\n\nThe Preserve at Vassar Gets New Trees\n\nStudent volunteers and community residents planted 200 trees on the Preserve at Vassar as part of a three-day project in September. The aim was to provide a buffer for the Casper Kill, a stream that runs through part of the Preserve, and to help foster the animal habitat. Preserve Director Keri VanCamp said the College used a $40,000 grant from a local conservation group, Partners for Climate Action Hudson Valley, to purchase 40 trees with a diameter of two inches or more and 160 smaller ones for the project. More than 50 species of trees—maple, American boxwood, sorghum, and cockspur thorn, to name just a few—were selected to enhance the Preserve’s biodiversity. The project is part of a comprehensive plan undertaken by the College to improve the entrance to the 500-acre Preserve, thanks to a major gift from the class of 1971. The gift will fund improved pathways; new pedestrian-safe paths to the Barns; modifications to vehicle traffic routes; and parking and signage to create a more welcoming entrance to the Farm and Preserve. VanCamp said the next phase of improvements will include the construction of a pavilion for picnicking and other gatherings by members of the local community as well as those from Vassar.\n\nVassar’s Historic Musical Performances Get New Life in Digital Recordings\n\nFor more than a century, students, faculty, and staff in Vassar’s Music Department, student choral groups, and the Vassar Libraries have been creating and collecting recordings of Vassar musical performances, but the collections have been physically deteriorating and incompletely cataloged, making them largely inaccessible to music scholars wishing to conduct research.\n\nA $40,000 grant from the Mellon Foundation through the Council on Library and Information Resources “Recordings at Risk” program enabled the College to digitize nearly 300 performances recorded on phonograph records, tapes, and compact discs between 1934 and 2016. They are available for listening at Vassar’s Digital Library by members of the Vassar community; educators and researchers may request access by emailing library_systems@vassar.edu. The recordings include formal concerts, Vassar class “parties” (original musical plays), a cappella group performances, school songs, and collaborations between Vassar faculty, students, and choral groups from other colleges and universities.\n\n“Recordings at Risk” is a limited-term (2017-2025) national regranting program to support preservation of rare and unique audio, audiovisual, and other media through digital reformatting.

But what if the ocean could help us absorb more carbon dioxide? Laura Haynes, Assistant Professor of Earth Science on the Mary Clark Rockefeller Chair, pictured above, will lead a comprehensive initiative to explore this question as a recipient of a $480,415 research grant from the National Oceanographic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA).\n\nHaynes, along with Jennifer Fehrenbacher, Associate Professor of Earth, Ocean, and Atmospheric Sciences at Oregon State University, and Emily Osborne, a Research Scientist at NOAA, will collaborate on a study. It will assess how proposals to use the ocean to combat the rise in carbon-dioxide levels in the atmosphere will affect marine organisms. Some are proposing to dump alkaline minerals into the ocean to help it absorb and store more carbon dioxide, but the impacts of these actions on marine life remain largely unknown. Haynes, Fehrenbacher, and Osborne will investigate how adding these minerals to the ocean would affect foraminifera—small, shell-building plankton that are important to the ocean’s carbon cycle.\n\nHaynes, who has been studying foraminifera throughout her academic career, said the grant would fund research she will be doing at the Bermuda Institute of Ocean Sciences in summer 2025 and 2026. She will recruit four Vassar students each year to assist her in her research. The grant is part of a $24.3 million project funded by the National Oceanographic Partnership Program, a consortium of public and private organizations including NOAA, the National Science Foundation, the federal Department of Energy, the Office of Naval Research, and the ClimateWorks Foundation.\n\nLumina Grant to Shine Light on College Success\n\nAccording to recent studies, four-year colleges in the United States graduate about half of their students in six years. But some institutions, including some that lack the resources of more prestigious colleges and universities, achieve much higher than expected results. A team of Vassar College researchers, headed by President Elizabeth H. Bradley, has secured a $125,000 grant from Lumina Foundation to learn how and why these institutions are succeeding.\n\nBradley will be joined by Wendy Maragh Taylor, Associate Dean of the College for Student Growth and Engagement, and Professor of Education Christopher Bjork as lead investigators on the project. Charlotte Gullick, Exploring Transfer Together Program Manager, and Biniam Tesfamariam, Vassar’s Director of Institutional Research, are the other members of the team. They plan to visit six institutions having greater than expected results over the next 12 months, meeting with faculty, students, and administrators to gather relevant data.\n\nThe Lumina Foundation is an independent, private foundation in Indianapolis committed to making opportunities for learning beyond high school available to all. Lumina envisions higher learning that is easy to navigate, addresses racial injustice, and meets the nation’s talent needs through a broad range of credentials. The foundation aims to work toward a system that prepares people for informed citizenship and success in a global economy. —Larry Hertz\n\nThe Frances Lehman Loeb Art Center Celebrates 30 Years and a Continuing Legacy\n\nFollow\n\nFollow\n\nFollow\n\nWhen the doors of the Frances Lehman Loeb Art Center—named after a trustee—first opened to the public in November 1993, the local and national headlines highlighted the construction of a “world-class art museum” to house the College’s already “exceptional art collection.” The architect César Pelli had, in his own words, designed a “symphony in architecture,” combining different spaces, materials, and lighting schemes to create “a series of movements.” The new building offered considerably more room and improved conditions to view Vassar’s art treasures, which had been, by that point, collected since its founding about 130 years before. Vassar was the first college in the United States to include an art museum as part of its original mission.\n\nWhen the doors of the Frances Lehman Loeb Art Center—named after a trustee—first opened to the public in November 1993, the local and national headlines highlighted the construction of a “world-class art museum” to house the College’s already “exceptional art collection.” The architect César Pelli had, in his own words, designed a “symphony in architecture,” combining different spaces, materials, and lighting schemes to create “a series of movements.” The new building offered considerably more room and improved conditions to view Vassar’s art treasures, which had been, by that point, collected since its founding about 130 years before. Vassar was the first college in the United States to include an art museum as part of its original mission.\n\nThe overall complex of structures, incorporating both the new edifice and the renovated Taylor Hall (site of the Art Department, its classrooms, and library), serves as the entrance to the campus alongside the Frederick Ferris Thompson Memorial Library fronting on Raymond Avenue. The two connected buildings reinforce the importance of the visual arts and other academic resources in promoting the open exchange of ideas and inquiry in a liberal arts education. As an example, among the almost 30,000 visitors to the Loeb last year, there were 4,492 students from 22 different departments and programs for nearly 250 class sessions (about half of which were in the arts). Moreover, in addition to the hundreds of works of art regularly on display, 619 objects were temporarily pulled from storage to support teaching in the building’s galleries and classrooms.\n\nVassar is not only celebrating the 30th anniversary of the Frances Lehman Loeb Art Center, but it is also honoring 160 years of the collection. From its very beginning, the College recognized the importance of the visual arts in promoting the open exchange of ideas in a liberal arts context.\n\nEvery year since 1999, when the first Coordinator for Public Education and Programs position was created, a dozen Vassar undergraduates are hired to work as Student Guides to give all public tours—serving kindergartners to senior citizens and everyone in between. Drawn from all class years and a wide range of disciplines, they give the Loeb a greater ability to connect with visitors on a variety of levels and from a range of perspectives. A current Student Guide majoring in American studies, now working with the newly endowed Putnam Assistant Director for Learning and Community Engagement, noted the significance of her experiences: “From the class meetings held in the galleries, fervently discussing lithography and curatorial practices, to conversations with eight-year-old patrons about the Hudson River School and how marble is carved into statues, the Loeb has taught me so much about art history, the process of sharing and exchanging ideas, and about myself as a learner and a teacher.”\n\nThe prominent location of the Frances Lehman Loeb Art Center intentionally forges a vital link to neighboring communities. The recent expansion of its outreach efforts—including partnerships with the Poughkeepsie City School District, Arlington Central School District, The Art Effect, Celebrating the African Spirit, Dutchess County Historical Society, Locust Grove Estate, and the Poughkeepsie Public Library District—was recognized last June when the Loeb received the Dutchess Award. The accompanying proclamation celebrated its “enriching educational programs and unwavering commitment to fostering creativity and cultural appreciation [that] have greatly enhanced the quality of life for residents of the County and beyond.”\n\nWhen the Vassar Quarterly, in 1990, announced that Frances Lehman Loeb, class of 1928, would provide funding for a new museum—the largest gift ever bestowed on the College by a living individual to date—she was lauded for her generosity:\n\n“All her life she has loved art, been inspired by it, and made it accessible to others.” Today, after 30 years, the Frances Lehman Loeb Art Center continues to honor a woman whose life of philanthropy and public service embodied the ideals of liberal learning and bolsters the reputation of her alma mater. —T.

The 3D laser scan of Notre-Dame of Paris that Tallon produced in 2010 has already been instrumental in the reconstruction of the Gothic cathedral, damaged in a catastrophic fire that broke out on April 15, 2019.\n\nOn the unseasonably warm evening of October 25, 2023, two of the three architects responsible for rebuilding the cathedral, Philippe Villeneuve, Architect-in-Chief of Historic Monuments in charge of Notre-Dame, and fellow restoration architect Pascal Prunet, delivered a Claflin Lecture at Vassar’s Martel Theater, speaking about their efforts to shore up, conserve, and restore the cathedral since the fire. Their visit to Vassar was made possible by The Friends of Notre-Dame de Paris in honor of Andrew Tallon. The third architect, Rémi Fromont, remained in Paris, where he is overseeing the final stages of the reconstruction of the roof and spire. This phase of the project is scheduled to conclude on December 8, 2023, when the new rooster Villeneuve designed will be installed atop the spire.\n\n“[Tallon’s] scan enabled us to reconstruct the vaults without any hesitation from a dimensional or formal standpoint, and it also granted us total freedom to understand how [the cathedral] was made, to be able to rebuild it in a thoughtful, intellectual, and intelligent way,” Villeneuve said during the recent visit to Vassar.\n\nTallon arrived at Vassar in 2007. Over the next three years, as part of a major grant he and Columbia art history professor Stephen Murray secured from the Mellon Foundation to develop an innovative website called Mapping Gothic France, Tallon selected two Vassar students annually to conduct summer fieldwork with him, Murray, and Murray’s doctoral students. The Vassar students Tallon selected were chosen through a competitive application process to participate in the digital humanities project and were responsible for taking 360-degree panoramic photographs of the scores of Romanesque and Gothic buildings the team visited in regions throughout France. Jessica Lentner ’09 and Kappy Mintie ’09 photographed sites in Champagne in 2008; Sofia Gans ’09 and Alexandra Thom ’09 focused on Normandy in 2009; and Ani Kodjabasheva ’12 and I [Lindsay Cook] concentrated on Burgundy in 2010.\n\nThat year, Tallon also scanned Notre-Dame. The primary reason he wanted to produce the laser survey was to study the cathedral’s structure, especially its flying buttresses, which had been rebuilt over the centuries. During Tallon’s lifetime, the 3D ambulat scan was put to multiple uses, including to produce a new ground plan of Notre-Dame and a series of illustrations presenting hypothetical reconstructions of historical states of the cathedral for a monograph he co-authored with Sorbonne art history professor Dany Sandron, first published in French in 2013. The book’s illustrations and captions were adapted for a trilingual display sponsored by Vassar’s President’s International Advisory Council, on view in the cathedral’s ambulatory from 2014 until the 2019 fire. It was viewed by more than 30 million visitors. An English-language edition of Tallon and Sandron’s book subsequently appeared as Notre Dame Cathedral: Nine Centuries of History, trans. Lindsay Cook (Penn State University Press, 2020).\n\nLaser scanning Notre-Dame, photographing it for Mapping Gothic France, and viewing its stonework from the upper terraces led Tallon to worry about the building’s structural integrity. André Finot, the cathedral’s spokesperson, came to Notre-Dame from a career in the advertising industry. Not long after his arrival, Tallon invited him to climb the cathedral to warn him about the state of the building. Finot remembered Tallon telling him, “You see all these stones? This building is in danger—you need to do something. You should create a foundation, and everybody will help, because everybody loves Notre-Dame. Have a good day!”\n\nIt may have sounded simple, but complicating matters was the fact that, by law, the City of Paris owns the land on which Notre-Dame sits, the French state owns the building itself, and the Catholic Church is responsible for maintaining the cathedral. With so many stakeholders involved, “nobody wanted to pay for anything,” Finot recalled. In his view, what ultimately moved the needle was a letter Tallon addressed to Cardinal André Vingt-Trois, then Archbishop of Paris, pleading with him to support the creation of what would eventually become the nonprofit Friends of Notre-Dame de Paris. Vassar alums championed this initiative both before and since the organization was officially founded in 2017, among them Nora Ann Wallace ’73 and Lorna Bade Goodman ’63, P’88, GP’22.\n\nWhen fire ripped through Notre-Dame’s roof on April 15, 2019, the restoration Tallon had helped set in motion was well underway. That very morning work began on one of the flying buttresses he had feared might fail. It was a lucky break that earlier that same week, sixteen of the copper statues adorning the spire were removed for conservation treatment and were not there when the fire broke out. They represent the twelve apostles and the four evangelists, integral to the spire restoration architect Eugène Viollet-le-Duc designed in the late 1850s. The carpentry supporting these figures was inspired, in part, by the base of the medieval spire, which still lingered under the roof in the mid-19th century, as University of Wisconsin-Whitewater Art History Professor Lynn T. Courtenay ’65 demonstrated in a noteworthy 1989 journal article.\n\nThe fire melted the lead roof tiles, destroyed the timber framework of both the 19th-century spire and the 13th-century nave and choir roofs, and weakened the stones its flames licked—but it could not claim the apostle and evangelist statues. They have since been restored, and, at the time of writing, they are all on view at the Cité de l’architecture et du patrimoine, the cultural heritage museum in Paris. Among these towering copper figures is St. Andrew, dedicated both to Cardinal André Vingt-Trois and to the memory of Andrew Tallon. When he visits the museum and sees the restored statue with Tallon’s name written on the plaque, Finot said, he feels “thankful for what [Tallon] did for Notre-Dame.”\n\nThe three architects bring a wealth of experience from their time restoring historic monuments in various regions of France, including some where wars and revolutions have left their mark, allowing for a modicum of creative freedom. The task is different, however, “when you work on icons,” according to Prunet. “At Notre-Dame, we are doing an enormous amount of work, but we are not doing creative work; we are putting things back together again,” he continued. “What we’re doing isn’t very personal,” Villeneuve added. Tallon’s laser scan has enabled the architects to allow Notre-Dame to “speak for itself,” according to Villeneuve.\n\nTallon had sent a copy of his point cloud (collection of data points plotted in 3D space) to Villeneuve’s predecessor, Benjamin Mouton, before the latter retired in 2013, and after the 2019 fire, Marie Tallon saw to it that Villeneuve, Prunet, and Fromont had access to her late husband’s work. During their lecture and in a follow-up interview conducted the next day, Villeneuve and Prunet said that Tallon’s scan—which Prunet called an “exact trace” of the state of the building at the time it was scanned—has been used in numerous ways since the fire. For example, it aided design of the wooden centering custom-made to cradle each unique flying buttress and rib vault and to rebuild the damaged vaults and the sole transverse arch destroyed when the tip of the spire separated from its base and fell westward, becoming a projectile that crashed into the nave.\n\n“Andrew Tallon’s point cloud, well, it’s a bit like listening to a Mahler symphony,” said Prunet, alluding to the scan’s sublime scale and complexity. Extending the musical metaphor, Prunet continued, “It’s a recording,” but one that “needs to be decrypted.” —Lindsay S. Cook ’10\n\nLindsay S. Cook ’10 earned her PhD from Columbia University.

Cretella Tennis Center Opens with Dedication Remarks, Open Play\n\nFollow\n\nFollow\n\nFollow\n\nThe dedication and official opening of the Richard L. Cretella Tennis Center kicked off a new era for Vassar’s men’s and women’s tennis teams. The new facility was made possible thanks to the Richard Cretella Trust, administered by Cretella’s sister Virginia Mars ’51, P’82, GP’04,’07; Mindy Mayer P’92, in memory of her son Eric M. Smith ’92, a member of the men’s tennis team for four years and who now has a court named after him; Chrysoula Dosiou P’22 and Andreas Stavropoulos P’22, who named a court after their daughter Melina Stavropoulos ’22; Georgia Carrington ’58; and Peter Frey ’82.\n\n“I can confidently say that Vassar now has one of the very best outdoor tennis facilities among our peer schools in the northeast,” Michelle Walsh, Director of Athletics and Physical Education at Vassar, said. “That makes such a big difference because it helps us to recruit outstanding scholar-athletes to the campus—students who excel in the classroom, on the court, and who contribute in so many different ways to our campus community.”\n\nThe Richard L. Cretella Tennis Center, built on the former Ballentine Field, has eight tennis courts made with “post-tension” concrete underneath that is made to last at least 20 years, new spectator seating, and storage for team equipment. A new scoreboard will also be installed soon. The courts are conveniently located directly adjacent to Walker Field House, providing the teams with access to locker rooms, indoor courts, and sports-medicine facilities.\n\nBefore the center, the teams had to take a roughly 15-minute walk from Walker Field House to the courts along Raymond Avenue, away from the locker rooms as well as the training and sports-medicine facilities. Now, the teams have a two-minute walk from the field house and its amenities.\n\n“On behalf of both the men’s and the women’s tennis teams, we are so incredibly grateful for this amazing state-of-the-art tennis facility,” Tina McDermott, head men’s tennis coach, said. “We’re just so very proud to practice and compete here. We want to thank the donors again for their support and generosity.”\n\nMars, encouraged by her daughters, created annuity trusts in both of her brothers’ names. When her older brother, Albert W. Cretella Jr., passed, a scholarship was created in his name. After Richard Cretella’s passing in October 2022, Mars and her daughters had a need for the trust to fund something for the College and the College had a need for new tennis courts. This was perfect, as Cretella was an avid tennis player, passing his knowledge and love for the game on to his children and his sister.\n\n“To me, it’s very fitting that a tennis center should be named for him because he would be one of the first ones to be pleased that that was what the money was used for,” Mars said. “The tennis courts needed to be moved and they needed to be where the sports center, the old one, is and a new one will hopefully be built.”\n\nUpon seeing the courts for the first time, Mars said, “It’s wonderful, beautiful, impressive. How many settings do you get like this for tennis?”\n\nThe teams and coaches are celebrating the new courts, too.\n\n“It’s the best facility by far I’ve ever had the opportunity to work on in my 26 years,” women’s head coach Marty Perry said. “From day one, the team is playing better. It’s a huge help to the success of the programs and for recruiting.”\n\n“The first day we practiced on the courts, our coach [Perry] was saying we were a different team,” Macey Dowd ’25, a member of the women’s team, said. “They’re a good source for recruiting.”\n\n“It’s a big step up from the old courts,” men’s team member Jay Wong ’24 added. “We’ve had a breakthrough and this gives us bigger potential to recruit and to host tournaments.”\n\nMembers of both teams said the new courts will provide a much better spectator experience and give the coaches better access to the players during practice.\n\n“It’s my last year and I’m going to enjoy every moment of it,” Benjamin Almquist ’24, a member of the men’s tennis team, said. “It’s beautiful. It really enhances the practice and match experience.”\n\nAs the Walker Field House shows its age, the new tennis courts, according to President Bradley, are “our first, and most recent step, toward strengthening the vision for Vassar Athletics broadly.\n\n“Having those courts really starts us on our way to the larger replacement that we need,” Bradley continued. “So, so much more to look forward to in the program.” —Heather Mattioli\n\nUpdating Vassar’s sports and recreation center and programs is a key component of the Fearlessly Consequential campaign.

Well aware of this, the two sisters who provided the funds to begin construction on Alumnae House put out the call to fellow alumnae for help outfitting the new building. And help they did: Gifts large and small began pouring in, ranging from grand items to small necessities. This began a tradition of gifting items and funds to the House that continues to this day. In fact, the vast majority of furnishings and artwork that have graced Alumnae House over time have been donated or purchased by alums, not the College.\n\nAlums donated trees and other plant materials for the grounds. They sent books they had written for the Alumnae House Library. Queen Ferry Coonley, one of the original benefactors, provided curtains and weaving for eight bedrooms.\n\nTwo silver vases and a dress belonging to Princess Ōyama (Sutematsu Yamakawa), class of 1892, were displayed in a room dedicated in her memory by the class. A watercolor of Matthew Vassar’s brewery, originally displayed in the pub, is a gift of Martha H. MacLeish, class of 1878; it was painted by her daughter, Ishbel, class of 1920. As part of the house’s 75th anniversary celebration in 1999, Martha Lingua-Wheless ’78 coordinated an Anniversary Quilt with over a dozen alums, which is still displayed on the second floor. And the list goes on!\n\nThe most iconic gift to the House, of course, is The Great Wonder: A Vision of the Apocalypse by Violet Oakley, a triptych painted by an artist personally connected to Vassar that was unveiled amidst great fanfare at the house’s formal dedication on June 8, 1924.\n\nThe Great Wonder and Great Influence of Violet Oakley\n\nThe triptych grew out of a visit made by alum Louise Meigs, class of 1891, to the studio of Violet Oakley—then America’s only successful woman mural painter. Meigs, the former roommate of Oakley’s late sister, Hester Oakley Ward, sought to commission a work for the College that would “express a noble idea of womanhood and be an inspiration to everyone who came [there]”; she was captivated by studies Oakley had made related to a passage from the Book of Revelation known as “The Woman Clothed with the Sun.” The passage describes a vision of the apostle John, who sees “a great and wondrous sign” appearing in heaven: “a woman clothed with the sun” who lifts the child she has just borne up to God, saving him from an evil dragon below. The triptych eventually was designated as a gift to Alumnae House from the class of 1891 as a memorial to Hester, who had died of scarlet fever in 1905.\n\nIn a pamphlet handed out at the dedication ceremony, Oakley explained the message of empowerment she wanted women to take from the artwork’s central image:\n\nIn the triptych The Great Wonder … the central [composition] unveils the high idea of Woman and the offspring of her own labours. … May it serve to lift up Every-Woman who contemplates it with inner vision and ponders its message with profound judgement; nerving her to bring to light—without fear—the child of her inmost yearning …; letting it be caught up from her own strong hands to even higher planes of truth …\n\nBut Oakley’s vision for Alumnae House did not stop with the massive artwork that still serves as the living room’s focal point; she created an entire setting for the triptych, from the Italian Trecento-style furniture that surrounded it to the hand-painted, beamed ceiling above it—finished at noon on the day before the house was dedicated. With funds from the Alumnae House Furnishing Committee, Oakley went on a European shopping spree—buying three carved choir stalls in England, an iron lectern in Spain, and a set of candlesticks in Italy, among other items.\n\nOakley’s original furnishings can still be found throughout the house. However, much of it has been moved to other rooms, as successive house decorators prioritized creature comfort over artistic statement.\n\nPub Murals by Anne Cleveland\n\nAlso still visible on two floors of Alumnae House are a series of murals illustrator Anne Cleveland ’37 painted for the house’s Pub in 1946. Depicting scenes of Vassar life with wit and whimsy, Cleveland’s art is as down to earth as Oakley’s is lofty. In perhaps the best loved of these, grinning students in the Daisy Chain file past frowning graduates, who clearly don’t want to leave their beloved alma mater.\n\nAs they were being painted, Liz DeLong ’47 offered a perfect tongue-in-cheek description in the June 5, 1946, issue of the\n\nMiscellany:\n\nTwo walls preserve for posterity and the anthropologists the unique posture of the female student at study. … On the other end of the wall, the secret, “behind the door” habits of bookworms are revealed to the public eye. The cross-legged style, upheld by the trustworthy floor, is the current vogue, with the “keep-your feet-above-your-head-so-the-blood-will-stay-in-your cerebrum” theory as a close second.\n\nAs finals approach, these poses can still be observed on campus!\n\nRestoration and Modernization\n\nMore recently, gifts have taken care of enhancements to the building. In 1972, the classes of 1907 and 1912 provided seed money to install the first electric elevator. In 1999, a group of alums known as the Triptych Society contributed gifts of $10,000 or greater toward the $5 million renovation of Alumnae House, which included central air conditioning and ADA compliance. Most recently two sisters—one an alum and the other a Vassar parent—donated funds to renovate and update all 13 private guest rooms in Alumnae House. [See here.]\n\nThese gifts all help to maintain the feeling so many have when visiting: that Alumnae House truly is a home away from home.\n\nA House Full of Life!\n\nBy Elizabeth Randolph\n\nThere’s the bricks-and-mortar story of Alumnae House—and then there’s the life fostered within: bonds made and strengthened over burgers at the Pub; during overnight stays in the House’s comfy guest rooms; at memorable senior class celebrations; by way of intellectually stimulating lectures and panels; and through celebrations—marriages and other ceremonies—honoring transitions in life.\n\nFollow\n\nFollow\n\nFollow\n\nThe Pub\n\nIn 1937, the private dining room adjacent to the main dining room became a sandwich shop—it was an attempt to generate revenue within the space—but it would transition to a full-service restaurant, The Pub, in 1939. With its cozy booths and tasty food, it quickly became a beloved hangout for students, employees, and members of the local community.\n\nIn the March 1950 issue of the Vassar Quarterly, Eloise Sydenstricker Morton ’50, who worked as a cashier in the establishment while a student, reflected that, at its inception, “Nobody dreamed how much it would supplement and at times replace the formal dining room service. Nobody suspected that 300 starving souls might appear for a Sunday breakfast, or that 100 faculty and townspeople would be served luncheon every day, indoors and out, or that 10 dozen hamburgers could be ordered and grilled in a single evening. Nobody realized how students would take the Pub to their hearts and call it their own.”\n\nAlthough the establishment had to cease operations as a full-service restaurant in 2009, it remains a gathering place for members of the Vassar community, hosting catered meetings, holiday celebrations, and other happenings, such as monthly Faculty Pub Nights—a chance for educators to relax and compare notes while enjoying drinks and nibbles. The Pub was even used as a location for taping the series From the Pub, which featured alums conversing on a variety of timely topics.\n\nNuptials\n\nThe House is a popular place for weddings. Martha Gouse Barry ’86, who has managed Alumnae House operations since 2007, says, “We average about five weddings a year—that’s 70 weddings in my time!” Alums and community members alike often have their rehearsal dinners, receptions, and post-wedding dinners there, as well.\n\nMatt Soper and Samantha Trautman Soper, both ’91, first met as regular patrons of Matthew’s Mug, and became closer in their senior year, when Samantha served as the statistician for the soccer team (Matt was Co-Captain). But it wouldn’t be until Reunion, five years later, that they would recognize their romantic potential. Vassar was so much a part of their story that getting married on campus seemed a no-brainer. They were married in the Chapel 25 years ago and chose to hold the reception and dinner at Alumnae House—a place Matt describes as warm, familiar, and timeless. About 30 alums joined them to celebrate their union—many of their guests stayed overnight at the inn.\n\nThe House provided a place of solace for Keith St. John ’81 and his husband Bill Garber when they married 15 years ago, three years before same-sex marriage would be legalized in New York. There were a lot of challenges to overcome. The Episcopal Diocese of Albany, where they live, didn’t allow same-sex marriages on its property or allow its clergy to perform the service. They traveled across the border to Massachusetts, where same-sex marriage was legal and recognized by New York to get married legally, then drove to Poughkeepsie the next day to the “much-adored” Alumnae House, located outside of the Albany jurisdiction. St. John says it was the perfect setting for the wedding he wanted. “Aside from being steeped in history and a part of the College and campus I had grown to love during my years at Vassar,” he says, “I was attracted to the warmth, beauty, and charm of Alumnae House—it was emblematic of the style and sophistication I had hoped would characterize the entire event.”\n\nComforting Accommodations in Times of Need\n\nYes, the Alumnae House has spent most of its existence as an inn, but there have been times when it has offered a bit of solace to those in dire need of housing.\n\nIn October 1943, during World War II, Vassar President MacCracken sought permission to house 35 freshmen in Alumnae House, due to an underestimation of the incoming class size. The alumnae association obliged. The House re-opened to regular house guests again in 1945.\n\nThroughout the first phase of the COVID pandemic, Alumnae House served as a place where students who had tested positive were able to isolate until they could return to campus. Aside from having a cushy place to land, students were fed meals and also treated to care packages arranged by local alums and House Manager Martha Barry.\n\nAll Things AAVC\n\nThe Alumnae Association of Vassar College (AAVC) has had a special relationship with the House—it’s where the executive directors of AAVC have had their offices and where the AAVC staff (now Alumnae/i Engagement) have always worked. Most of the administrative functions of the AAVC were absorbed into the structure of the College after an agreement between the entities in 2010.\n\nAlumnae House has been a home base for AAVC Board functions, too. Each year the AAVC honors outstanding alums, faculty members, and staff who exemplify ideals of service, excellence in their fields, and that certain je ne sais quoi we call the “Vassar spirit.” The Alumnae House Dining Room has often been where the honorees are feted.\n\nThe House also provides a comfortable and inviting space for AAVC Board meetings. Brian Farkas ’10, a current Vice President of the AAVC Board, notes the extra special importance the House takes on not only when tackling board business, but also in the “off times” after meetings:\n\nThe best part of the board meetings comes around 10:00 p.m. After dinner is done, the Vassar administrators head home. Twenty spirited alums, spanning seven decades, are left all alone. Where do these nerdy Vassar people go? The library, of course! The Alumnae House Library is a small, elegant, Victorian, wood-paneled gem hidden away in the back of the House. Its hodgepodge of furniture includes soft couches and stiff chairs, all of it probably manufactured sometime between 1861 and 1961. The bookshelves are lined with a century of Vassarions on the left and 1980s trash-fiction on the right. For no particular reason, there are a few dozen copies of National Geographic on the top shelf. None of the lamps match, though no one seems to notice. There are nights the board stays there until 2:00 or 3:00 a.m. discussing just about everything, assisted by wine and M&Ms. We talk about our Vassar friend groups, our families, and our careers. We also talk about our dreams for the College. Where can we lead this place over its next century? Where will it lead us? These conversations unfold under a portrait of Henry Noble MacCracken, Vassar’s fifth and longest-serving president, and among the most ambitious in our history. There’s something very Vassar about it all. The Alumnae House Library is a metaphor for Vassar itself—tiny and enormous, safe and subversive, curated and random, totally sheltered and Fearlessly Consequential.\n\nReunions\n\nGraduating doesn’t mean alums need to miss out on spending time at Alumnae House. During Reunion weekends, Alumnae House holds a special treat for members of Vassar’s “vintage” classes, who stay and dine at the House.\n\nCommunity Events\n\nThe Alumnae House often hosts catered events organized by members of the local community. Alumnae House Manager Martha Barry says, “We probably do one or two bar and bat mitzvahs per year, numerous bridal and baby showers, engagement and anniversary parties, baby christenings, memorial services, receptions, and holiday parties for the public.” There are also regular occasion spaces for such events as the Vassar Haiti Project, Poughkeepsie Yacht Club fund-raisers, and Murder Mystery Dinners.\n\nstudent engagement\n\nFirst-year students begin to get acquainted with the House as early as Orientation, when the College issues a “Traditions Checklist.” Students experience and “check off” Vassar traditions such as Convocation and Primal Scream for a chance to win prizes. One tradition involves a visit to the House, where students get their first chance to taste the College’s famous dessert—the Vassar Devil!\n\nSince 2008, seniors have marked 100 nights before graduation with a party at Alumnae House bearing that name—100 Nights. There’s something about being close to the finish line that encourages revelry. Even closer to graduation, during Senior Week, students have traditionally gathered at Alumnae House for their Senior Receptions to celebrate the upcoming milestone. Who remembers posing for their senior class picture on those Vassar-famous steps?\n\nBetween their first year at the College and the last, students get the opportunity to visit the House for all manner of receptions, recitals, lectures, workshops, and panels.\n\nBookends\n\nBy Elizabeth Randolph\n\nFollow\n\nFollow\n\nFollow\n\nIt brings to mind the symmetry of bookends that two sisters—Blanche Ferry Hooker, class of 1894, and Queene Ferry Coonley, class of 1896—gifted funds to build Alumnae House. Now, a century after its dedication, two other sisters have made a significant gift to renovate all 13 private rooms at the House, ensuring it will remain a comfortable, attractive, and welcoming home for alums and other guests to come.\n\nSally Dayton Clement ’71, P’09, a clinical social worker and psychoanalyst based in New York City and Millbrook, NY, and Ellen “Elly” Dayton Grace P’03, a multidisciplinary artist who resides in Minneapolis, MN, come from a long line of generous citizens invested in supporting their communities.\n\nTheir mother, Mary Lee Lowe Dayton ’46, had been active in civic affairs and the feminist movement and worked to support such women’s organizations as Planned Parenthood. She established a fund now known as the Women’s Foundation of Minnesota, which focuses on community-based programs that “ensure safety, opportunity, and pathways to economic security for women, girls, gender-expansive people, and families across Minnesota.”\n\nTheir father, Wallace C. Dayton, had been keenly interested in environmental conservation; he led and supported such organizations as The Nature Conservancy and the National Audubon Society.\n\nThe philanthropic tradition really inspires me, and I’m sure Elly, also. Our parents had a model for being involved in organizations they cared about both in terms of money and time.\n\nSaLLY DAYTON CLEMENT ’71, P’09\n\nVassar had made an indelible impression on Mary Lee, and she gave back in many ways, including serving as a trustee from 1993–1997. Alumnae House also had a special place in her heart. She, along with 35 other students, lived in there as first-year students due to a housing shortage on campus during WWII.\n\nIn the early 2000s, Sally, then a new Vassar Trustee, told Mary Lee the College had raised most of the money to renovate Alumnae House, but was still looking for funds to install air conditioning. Mary Lee asked, “Why aren’t they asking us for money?” She thought those who had adopted Alumnae House as their dorm for one “cozy” year would be happy to support the renovation of the building. She certainly stepped up, donating the funds to make the house a comfortable place to stay year-round.\n\nIn a tribute published in VQ after Mary Lee’s death, her Alumnae House roommate, Katherine Winton Evans ’46, noted that Mary Lee—whom the Minneapolis Star Tribune had dubbed “a civic lioness”—had also funded a renovation of the Wimpfheimer Nursery School, where she’d spent a good deal of time as a child study major (Mary Lee later worked as a kindergarten teacher). But Katherine noted that Alumnae House would remain one of Mary Lee’s “favorite cubs.”\n\nThe tradition of giving continues with the sisters. When asked what their mother would say if she were alive, Sally says, “She would be very happy to see that Elly and I are giving a gift to a place as meaningful to her as Alumnae House. The philanthropic tradition really inspires me, and I’m sure Elly, also. Our parents had a model for being involved in organizations they cared about both in terms of money and time.”\n\nIn addition to her joint gift, Sally has spent plenty of hours in volunteer roles at the College—she served an unusual 12 years as a trustee, after having served three years as a “Young Trustee,” a short-lived designation in the 1970s. (Her son Winston Clement ’09, following in her footsteps, now serves as a trustee.) Sally is currently Co-Chair of the Pyramid Society, a group of former trustees that continues to support the College and each other in innumerable ways. Those experiences have definitely kept her more connected and engaged with Vassar, she says.\n\nIt doesn’t hurt that she owes a debt of gratitude to Vassar for helping her meet her husband, Stephen. “My classmate Margot [Clement Clark] invited me home to Buffalo Easter weekend freshman year because she felt sorry for me. I had no place to go that long holiday weekend,” says Sally, who hails from Minnesota. “It was then I met her big brother.”\n\nFor her part, Elly says, “It’s kind of sweet that I get to combine this gift with my sister.” Though she is not an alum, she has seen how Vassar has benefited her daughter Katy Sturgis ’03. “My daughter has so many good memories of Vassar. She still has very close ties to the friends she made there, strong connections,” she says. “So it definitely inspires me to support the school.”\n\nAs Vassar’s new Inn is constructed down the hill, a stone’s throw from the House, Sally is convinced that the venerable building will remain relevant for those who call Vassar their alma mater. “Alumnae House is a reflection of Vassar’s history and longevity. It’s an old-fashioned building that is beautiful and charming,” she says. “That reflects the College’s roots. And the two buildings side-by-side really show Vassar is anchored in the present, too.”\n\nBeyond Vassar\n\nPlaywright juliany taveras ’16 saw several exciting projects come to fruition in 2023. The second season of the Amazon Original series With Love, on which taveras served as a writer, began streaming in June. And when VQ caught up with the former media studies major in the fall, they were eagerly anticipating the opening of Morris Micklewhite and the Tangerine Dress, an adaptation of the children’s book by the same name, at the Children’s Theatre Company in Minneapolis. The play will eventually travel to the Chicago Children’s Theatre and Rose Theater in Omaha. In fact, taveras has become something of a go-to talent for bringing children’s literature to the stage and screen and is currently adapting the book Julián Is a Mermaid for an animated feature. “It’s just something I’m really drawn to because, as an artist, I’m in conversation with my younger self and thinking about what that child needed, and thinking about what I want to offer back to the world,” they explained. While taveras said they didn’t consciously fit themself into this niche, they remember taking a course on adaptation with their creative writing adviser at Vassar, Adjunct Associate Professor Emerita of English M Mark. “We would look at different work that had been adapted and at this larger idea of how we’re constantly adapting and building off of each other’s work as artists,” they recalled. “I think it’s funny that I’m here doing that in a very direct way!”\n\nLaura Kinter ’13, Executive Director of Awakenings Art, a community studio that provides survivors of sexual violence with trauma-informed, inclusive art-making experiences that encourage healing, was named an Obama Foundation Scholar for 2023–24. The highly competitive program supports rising leaders from around the world in an innovative one-year academic experience. According to the foundation’s site, Kinter “plans to leverage the Scholars program curriculum to work at a systems change level to address the prevalence of sexual assault and aims to foster collective impact by bringing together rape-crisis centers, law firms, therapists, shelters, prevention organizations, and policy advocates to improve the pathway to healing for survivors.” Kinter is considered a rising star in Chicago, IL, NGO leadership. Since she started at Awakenings Art in 2018, she has transitioned the organization from an exhibition space to a restorative center for survivor services offering free art workshops, a cohort program, and more. She is an MBA candidate at the University of Chicago’s Booth School of Business, where she was named a Neubauer Civic Scholar. The scholarship program, which aims to create better business leaders in the social sector, provided a “full ride” for Kinter.\n\nWriter MB Caschetta ’88 won a 2023 Memoir Book Prize from Memoir Magazine for A Cheerleader’s Guide to Spiritual Enlightenment, a collection of essays she’s written since the 1990s. The book was also the subject of a story in the Advocate, which called it an “enlightening, witty read” and noted that while the topics Caschetta covers can be heavy—her battle with long COVID, her disinheritance by her father, losing friends to AIDS—she often finds moments of humor. “I feel like humor saves me,” she told the magazine.\n\nDeborah Steinberg ’14, Senior Health Policy Attorney at the Legal Action Center, was a finalist for the Excellence in Advocacy Awards presented by Women in Government Relations to honor “everyday advocates who dedicate themselves to representing their issue, cause, or organization in the public policy arena.” Steinberg’s advocacy focus is expanding access to comprehensive and equitable care for substance-use disorder and eliminating discriminatory barriers to treatment.\n\nDavid B. Allison ’85, Dean, Distinguished Professor, and Provost Professor at Indiana University–Bloomington School of Public Health was named a 2023 Sigma Xi Fellow. Founded at Cornell University in 1866, Sigma Xi promotes “excellence in scientific investigation and encourages a sense of companionship and cooperation among researchers in all fields of science and engineering” and counts more than 200 winners of the Nobel Prize among its membership. Allison is a staunch advocate for rigor in research methods and the uncompromisingly truthful communication of research findings. He has continually been a principal investigator in NIH-funded grants for more than 25 years and has authored more than 600 scientific publications. His many honors include the National Science Foundation Presidential Award for Excellence in Science, Mathematics, and Engineering Mentoring (2006). In 2022, he was named a Distinguished Lecturer by Sigma Xi, and received the Hoebel Prize for Creativity (Society for the Study of Ingestive Behavior). He received the 2023 Bodil M. Schmidt-Nielsen Distinguished Mentor and Scientist Award, bestowed by the American Physiological Society. Elected to the National Academy of Medicine in 2012, he also serves as Co-Chair of the National Academy of Sciences’ Strategic Council for Research Excellence, Integrity, and Trust.\n\nFiona Shen-Bayh ’11, Assistant Professor of Government and Politics at the University of Maryland, received the 2023 American Political Science Association’s Theodore J. Lowi First Book Award for Undue Process: Persecution and Punishment in Autocratic Courts. The association noted, “This important work on autocratic courts in sub-Saharan Africa during the post-independence era looks at how and why autocrats choose to punish opponents through the judicial process, and the circumstances under which they resort to extrajudicial means.”\n\nJasmine Brown ’10, a Senior Producer of ABC’s World News Tonight with David Muir, and her team won the Emmy Award for Outstanding Live News Program at the 44th Annual News & Documentary Emmys. The awards were presented on September 27 at the Palladium Times Square in New York City. Brown, who previously served as a producer on ABC’s Nightline, is the recipient of numerous other honors including three Edward R. Murrow Awards and a Nieman Fellowship from Harvard University.\n\nFinance professional Darys Estrella ’92 was featured on the August 2023 cover of Hispanic Image magazine in a story about realizing the American Dream. In a LinkedIn post, Estrella thanked the magazine for the honor and said, “My goal is to inspire other women to pursue their dreams, to dare to go for more despite fear, to learn to set limits, to invest in themselves and to understand that they are the masters of their own destiny.”\n\nHallie Ayres ’18, a New York–based researcher and art historian, was chosen as a co-curator of the Shanghai Biennale, which runs through March 31, 2024, at the city’s Power Station of Art Museum. The biennale is one of the most high-profile contemporary art events in Shanghai and the oldest, most established art biennale in China. Ayres serves as Associate Director at e-flux, a web platform that fosters critical discourse in art, architecture, film, and theory, and connects many of the most significant art institutions with audiences around the world through art projects, symposia, and exhibitions. Her writing has been featured in e-flux Criticism and e-flux Journal. She has lectured at the Academy of Fine Arts, Prague, and is a research fellow at the Institute of the Cosmos, where she edited Cosmic Bulletin 2021. Ayers has produced a number of experimental films in the U.S. and Turkey. —Compiled by Kimberly Schaye\n\nVassar Yesterday\n\nWhen Oppenheimer Came to Campus\n\nIn 1958, the “father of the atomic bomb” spoke on campus. We remember his visit, as well as Jean Tatlock ’35, writer, activist, psychiatrist, and his lover, who were both portrayed in this summer’s blockbuster film.\n\nFollow\n\nFollow\n\nFollow\n\nIn 1958, the “father of the atomic bomb,” J. Robert Oppenheimer had a message for the Vassar community: There is more information than ever before, and people must be strategic about learning it. It’s a message Vassar students are still exploring.\n\nIn October 1958, about a decade and a half after leading the Los Alamos Laboratory in developing the atomic bomb as part of the Manhattan Project, Oppenheimer came to Vassar. Then the Director of the Institute for Advanced Study, he gave a speech in the Chapel and spent the next day visiting classes and meeting with students, faculty members, and science clubs. He also did an interview with The Miscellany News, telling the student newspaper that education was a “roadmap” to knowledge areas, but also that one should not take it too seriously because the roads are always being torn up.\n\nThe visit happened after the Atomic Energy Commission revoked Oppenheimer’s security clearance in 1954 due to alleged Communist associations. The theoretical physicist now spent his time delivering lectures. He published a book of his talks, spoke at Columbia and Harvard, and, in 1958, before coming to Vassar, spent a month or two giving talks at the Sorbonne in Paris, followed by lecturing in Tel Aviv. “Oppenheimer was carving out a new role for himself,” Kai Bird and Martin J. Sherwin wrote in their 2005 biography American Prometheus, the basis for this summer’s Oppenheimer film. “Once he had been the scientific insider; now he was becoming a distant but charismatic intellectual outsider.”\n\nSo when Oppenheimer arrived in Poughkeepsie, the Vassar community must have been eager to hear his thoughts. In his speech, “Knowledge and the Structure of Culture,” he focused on the expansion in human knowledge. “Today it can hardly be doubted that every 10 years or so we know twice as much as we did 10 years before,” he told the audience. Information did not go to everyone or to individuals, but instead to communities of specialists “who are in charge of that particular adventure,” he said. A person can’t know everything and instead must “ignore a great deal which, as an organism, we are perfectly capable of knowing,” he continued, “blotting out a great part of the truth in order that some truth may be perceived.”\n\nHe concluded by saying that in uncertain times, science provides order. “In this vast world, with its unceasing change and its immense novelty, without precedent, beyond easy comprehension,” he said, “there are present for us these beautiful, simple, always growing perspectives of order, more than ever before in man’s history.” He received a standing ovation.\n\nMemories of the lecture would remain with students for decades. Katie Webb Johnson ’62, who was just weeks into her freshman year, didn’t know much about Oppenheimer ahead of the talk. “I remember being extremely impressed by him as a speaker,” she says. “But I was struggling to keep up because I was not well versed in those things.” She recalls others in the audience having stronger thoughts about the speaker, given the security-clearance controversy, which even the Misc. alluded to in the lead-up to the lecture. “There was a significant emotional aura, cloud, around his speech,” Johnson remembered—many students in the audience “had opinions.”\n\nOff campus, alums debated the merits of inviting Oppenheimer, too. Writing to VQ, a 1928 alum questioned why Vassar would invite such a poor security risk. “Is loyalty to country in poor repute at Vassar these days?” she asked.\n\nAssociate Professor of Physics and Science, Technology, and Society José Perillán, who directs the STS program, has incorporated Oppenheimer’s lecture into a class. He typically has students analyze a 1959 essay by philosopher of science Thomas Kuhn, and this fall he added the Oppenheimer talk, “putting them into conversation,” he says. “It’s just a fascinating point/counterpoint of a historian of science who was trained as a scientist, and this great scientist, Oppenheimer, who’s reflecting on knowledge and the creation of knowledge and our modern scientific enterprise.”\n\nPerillán believes Vassar held a special and personal meaning for the theoretical physicist. He points to a line Oppenheimer quoted in his speech from the poet John Donne: “’Tis all in pieces, all coherence gone, all just supply, and all relation.” Jean Tatlock ’35, who had been romantically involved with Oppenheimer, is known to have shared Donne’s poetry with him. “He’s giving the talk at her home institution, one of the places she really cared about, and he quotes a poet that she got him interested in,” Perillán says, noting that Tatlock had died more than a decade before Oppenheimer’s speech. “I find it hard to believe that that’s just a coincidence. He was very methodical and very intentional about what he said.”\n\nTatlock arrived at Vassar after her father, a literary scholar and professor at another institution, had spoken on campus multiple times. As a student, her social justice concerns were in evidence. Writing for the Misc., Tatlock penned an eyewitness account of a labor strike, and made the local news when she and other students wrote a letter in support of people who were marching for food and shelter. A Poughkeepsie Eagle-News editorial said the letter “will doubtless start new comment about radicalism at Vassar.”\n\nAs this summer’s film depicts, Oppenheimer and Tatlock’s relationship was complex. They met through friends at Berkley the year after she graduated from Vassar (she was a graduate student and Oppenheimer was a physics professor). She is said to have introduced him to the Communist Party. He later testified that they almost married twice. He instead married Katherine “Kitty” Harrison in 1940, but he and Tatlock, who would go on to become a psychiatrist, continued to meet. They are last known to have seen each other in 1943, an encounter that alarmed U.S. intelligence due to concerns that Oppenheimer might use Tatlock to pass information to the Soviets.\n\nThe following year, Tatlock, who had battled depression throughout her life, was found dead by an apparent suicide, though Kai Bird and Martin J. Sherwin in their book American Prometheus: The Triumph and Tragedy of J. Robert Oppenheimer explored other theories, including assassination.\n\nOppenheimer addressed their relationship during his security hearing a decade later, telling the panel, “She loved this country and its people and its life.” What he didn’t say was that she may have had trouble being happy in her own. —Max Kutner ’11\n\nMax Kutner has written for Newsweek, The Boston Globe, and Smithsonian."
