        "text": "A selective listing by critics of The Times of new or noteworthy opera, classical music and dance events this weekend in the Northeast.\n\nOpera\n\n''COSÌ FAN TUTTE.'' The Berkshire Opera starts its performance season with a New York touch with tomorrow's opening of a Così staged by the exemplary Rhoda Levine, with sets by Michael Yeargan. Following last summer's ''Don Giovanni,'' another Mozart-Da Ponte collaboration, the company brings to this lighter comedy a promising cast, including Jennifer Dudley -- a mezzo-soprano familiar from sundry Glimmerglass productions and small Metropolitan Opera roles -- as Dorabella, and the Giovanni returnees Stephen Powell and Barbara Shirvis as Guglielmo and Fiordiligi. The opera will be sung in Italian, with English supertitles. Tomorrow at 8, Koussevitsky Arts Center, Berkshire Community College, Pittsfield, Mass., (413) 644-9000. Tickets: $20 to $60 (Anne Midgette).\n\n''L'ÉTOILE.'' Glimmerglass Opera. This delightful but rarely heard Chabrier operetta is presented in an imaginative staging by Mark Lamos, on sleek, clean-lined but quirkily amusing sets by Andrew Lieberman. The plot, naturally, is full of farcical twists involving King Ouf I, whose search for someone to execute (an annual tradition in his kingdom) is thwarted when the court astrologer discovers that the king is fated to die a day after the death of the intended victim, one Lazuli. Apart from the inevitable complication -- including Lazuli's having fallen in love with King Ouf's intended -- this offers a measure of protection for Lazuli and causes much anxiety when Lazuli is presumed dead. The cast includes Torrance Blaisdell as Ouf I, Christine Abraham as Lazouli, Troy Cook as Hérisson de Porc-Épic and Karina Gauvin as Laoula. Sunday at 2 p.m. Glimmerglass Opera, Route 80, north of Cooperstown, N.Y. (607) 547-2255. Tickets: $24 to $94 (Allan Kozinn).\n\n''LE NOZZE DI FIGARO.'' Glimmerglass Opera. This company's 920-seat Alice Busch Opera Theater is a comfortably intimate place to hear opera, a quality that serves Mozart's operas particularly well. Stephen Lawless's production of ''Figaro'' focuses sharply on the class distinctions at work in the Almaviva household, a major element of both Mozart's work and the Beaumarchais play from which it is drawn. That isn't to say that other elements are ignored: sexual tensions and questions of trust and betrayal hold prominent places in the spotlight here as well, all abetted by Benoît Dugardyn's elegantly classical sets and Johann Stegmeir's amusingly stylized costumes. George Manahan conducts a cast that includes Dean Ely as Figaro, Nicole Heaston as Susanna, Joyce Guyer as the Countess, Christopher Schaldenbrand as the Count and Valerie Komar as Cherubino. Tomorrow at 8 p.m., Glimmerglass Opera, Route 80, north of Cooperstown, N.Y. (607) 547-2255. Tickets: $24 to $94 (Kozinn).\n\n''TURANDOT.'' It's not Zeffirelli's excess, but John Hoomes's production of Puccini's ''Turandot,'' in its third performance tonight, is the largest opera the New Jersey Opera Festival has ever essayed on the relatively modest stage of Princeton's McCarter Theater. Michael Ching, general/artistic director of the Memphis Opera, conducts, and the Russian soprano Anna Shafajinskaia takes the title role. The festival's weekend continues with its premiere of ''Il Prigioniero'' by Luigi Dallapiccola and ''Bluebeard's Castle'' by Bartok tomorrow night, and a repeat performance of Gluck's ''Orfeo ed Euridice,'' in a superficially attractive but ultimately unsatisfying production with two respectable singers, Margaret Lattimore and Christine Brandes, on Sunday afternoon. Tonight and tomorrow night at 8 and Sunday at 2 p.m., McCarter Theater Center, Princeton, N.J., (609) 919-1003 or (609) 258-2787. Tickets: $24 to $82 (Midgette).\n\n''WHITE RAVEN,'' Lincoln Center Festival 2001. The composer Philip Glass is reunited with his longtime collaborator the director and designer Robert Wilson in their opera ''White Raven,'' which is receiving its much-awaited American premiere as a major event of the Lincoln Center Festival 2001. With a libretto in Portuguese by the writer Lucia Costa Gomes -- a cut-and-paste assemblage of philosophical ruminations, travel logs and newspaper headlines -- the opera purports to examine the exploits of Vasco da Gama and other late 15th-century Portuguese navigators, though the larger subjects of discovery, exploration and culture shock are the real focus. Coherent storytelling is not the point here. But Mr. Wilson fills the stage with alluring imagery and surreal characters, including exotic animals, a sad-faced Dog Man, a Tin Man and a Miss Universe on a crescent moon. Mr. Glass's undulant music of repetitive rhythms and melodic ripples is sometimes fetching and even beautiful. But too often he slips into automatic pilot and the score sounds padded. Yet ''White Raven'' is worth seeing for its imaginative moments and the challenge it presents to the definition of opera. Dennis Russell Davies conducts the American Composers Orchestra. Tonight and tomorrow night at 8, New York State Theater, (212) 875-5600. Tickets: $20 to $90 (Anthony Tommasini).\n\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.
