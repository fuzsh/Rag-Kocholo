Scott Aaron Copland teaching a Berkshire Music Center composing class in the 1940s (Howard S. Babbitt, Jr./ BSO Archives) This summer marks the 70th anniversary of the Tangle- wood Music Center, the BSO's summer training institute for young musicians that was founded (as the Berkshire Music Center) by Serge Koussevitzky in 1940. In con- junction with this anniversary, the BSO Archives has mounted an exhibit at the Tanglewood Visitor Center. The display celebrates the seven decades of teaching and learning that have influenced generations of instru- mentalists, conductors, vocalists, and composers who have studied with BSO musicians and conductors, as well as with a vast number of distinguished composers and other visiting artists on the TMC faculty. In addition, a special exhibit on the first floor of the Highwood Manor House celebrates the work of distin- guished photographer Walter H. Scott (1931-2009). For more than a quarter-century, from 1974, Walter Scott documented the history of Tanglewood through the thousands of pictures he took. Curated by his son Hilary Scott, the exhibit includes vintage prints from Walter Scott's Stockbridge studio. -■-'■- ■ \"-/ &^ -v^-' -'I j ^ First page of the manuscript score of Randall Thompson 's \"Alleluia, \" composed for the opening exercises of the Berkshire Music Center's inaugural session in 1940 (BSO Archives) A late-1970s portrait of Tanglewood photographer Walter H. Scott (courtesy Hilary Scott) Tanglewood The Tanglewood Festival In August 1934 a group of music-loving summer residents of the Berkshires organized a series of three outdoor concerts at Interlaken, to be given by members of the New York Philhar- monic under the direction of Henry Hadley. The venture was so successful that the promoters incorporated the Berkshire Symphonic Festival and repeated the experiment during the next summer. The Festival Committee then invited Serge Koussevitzky and the Boston Symphony Orchestra to take part in the following year's concerts. The orchestra's Trustees accepted, and on August 13, 1936, the Boston Symphony Orchestra gave its first concerts in the Berkshires (at Holmwood, a former Vanderbilt estate, later the Center at FoxhoUow). The series again consisted of three concerts and was given under a large tent, draw- ing a total of nearly 15,000 people. In the winter of 1936 Mrs. Gorham Brooks and Miss Mary Aspinwall Tap- pan offered Tanglewood, the Tappan family estate, with its buildings and 210 acres of lawns and meadows, as a gift to Koussevitzky and the orchestra. The offer was gratefully accepted, and on August 5, 1937, the festival's largest crowd to that time assembled under a tent for the first Tanglewood concert, an all-Beethoven program. After the storm of August 12, 1937, which precipitated a fundraising drive for the construction of the Tanglewood Shed (BSO Archives) At the all-Wagner concert that opened the 1937 festival's second weekend, rain and thunder twice interrupted the Rienzi Overture and necessitated the omission alto- gether of the \"Forest Murmurs\" from Siegfried, music too delicate to be heard through the downpour. At the intermission. Miss Gertrude Robinson Smith, one of the festival's founders, made an appeal to raise funds for the building of a permanent structure. The appeal was broadened by means of a printed circular handed out at the two remaining concerts, and within a short time enough money had been raised to begin active planning for a \"music pavilion.\" Eliel Saarinen, the eminent architect selected by Koussevitzky, proposed an elaborate design that went far beyond the immediate needs of the festival and, more important, went well beyond the budget of $100,000. His second, simplified plans were still too expensive; he finally wrote that if the Trustees insisted on remaining within their budget, they would have \"just a shed, ...which any builder could accomphsh without the aid of an architect.\" The Trustees then turned to Stockbridge engineer Joseph Franz to make further simplifications in Saarinen's plans in order to lower the cost. The building he erected was inaugurated on the evening of August 4, 1938, when the first concert of that year's festival was given, and remains, with modifications, to this day. It has echoed with the music of the Boston Symphony Orches- tra every summer since, except for the war years 1942-45, and has become almost a place of pilgrimage to millions of concertgoers. In 1959, as the result of a collaboration between the acoustical consultant Bolt Beranek and Newman and architect Eero Saarinen and Associates, the installation of tiie tiien-unique Edmund Hawes Talbot Orchestra Canopy, along with other improvements, produced the Shed's present world-famous acoustics. In 1988, on the occasion of its fiftieth anniversary, the Shed was rededicated as \"The Serge Koussevitzky Music Shed,\" recognizing the far-reaching vision of the BSO's legendary music director. In 1940, the Berkshire Music Center (now the Tanglewood Music Center) began its opera- tions. By 1941 the Theatre-Concert Hall, the Chamber Music Hall, and several small studios were finished, and the festival had so expanded its activities and its reputation for excellence that it attracted nearly 100,000 visitors. With the Boston Symphony Orchestra's acquisition in 1986 of the Highwood estate adjacent to Tanglewood, the stage was set for the expansion of Tanglewood's pubhc grounds by some 40%. A master plan developed by the Cambridge firm of Carr, Lynch, Hack and Sandell to unite the Tanglewood and Highwood properties confirmed the feasibility of using the newly acquired property as the site for a new concert hall to replace the outmoded Theatre-Concert Hall (which was used continuously with only minor modifications since 1941, and which with some modification has been used in recent years for the Tanglewood Music Center's opera productions), and for improved Tanglewood Music Center facilities. Inaugurated on July 7, 1994, Seiji Ozawa Hall — designed by the architectural firm William Rawn Associates of Boston in collaboration with acoustician R. Lawrence Kirkegaard & Associates of Downer's Grove, Illinois, and representing the first new concert facility to be constructed at Tanglewood in more than a half-century — now provides a modern venue for TMC concerts, and for the var- ied recital and chamber music concerts offered by the Boston Symphony Orchestra through- out the summer. Ozawa Hall with its attendant buildings also serves as the focal point of the Tanglewood Music Center's Leonard Bernstein Campus, as described below. Also at Tangle- wood each summer, the Boston University Tanglewood Institute sponsors a variety of pro- grams that offer individual and ensemble instruction to talented younger students, mosdy of high school age. Today Tanglewood annually draws more than 300,000 visitors. Besides the concerts of the Boston Symphony Orchestra, there are weekly chamber music concerts, Friday- and Saturday- evening Prelude Concerts, Saturday-morning Open Rehearsals, the annual Festival of Con- temporary Music, and almost daily concerts by the gifted young musicians of the Tanglewood Music Center. The Boston Pops Orchestra appears annually, and the season closes with a weekend-long Jazz Festival. The season offers not only a vast quantity of music but also a vast range of musical forms and styles, all of it presented with a regard for artisdc excellence that makes the festival unique. The Tanglewood Music Center Since its start as the Berkshire Music Center in 1940, the Tanglewood Music Center has become one of the world's most influential centers for advanced musical study. Serge Kous- sevitzky, the Boston Symphony Orchestra's music director from 1924 to 1949, founded the Center with the intention of creating a premier music academy where, with the resources of a great symphony orchestra at their disposal, young instrumentalists, vocalists, conductors, and composers would sharpen their skills under the tutelage of Boston Symphony Orchestra musicians and other specially invited artists. The Music Center opened formally on July 8, 1940, with speeches and music. \"If ever there was a time to speak of music, it is now in the New World,\" said Koussevitzky, alluding to the war then raging in Europe. \"So long as art and culture exist there is hope for humanity.\" Randall Thompson's Alleluia for unaccompanied chorus, specially written for the ceremony, arrived less than an hour before the event began but made such an impression that it contin- ues to be performed at the opening ceremonies each summer. The TMC was Koussevitzky's pride and joy for the rest of his life. He assembled an extraordinary faculty in composition, operatic and choral activities, and instrumental performance; he himself taught the most gifted conductors. Koussevitzky continued to develop the Tanglewood Music Center until 1950, a year after his retirement as the BSO's music director. Charles Munch, his successor in that position, ran the Tanglewood Music Center from 1951 through 1962, working with Leonard Bernstein and Aaron Copland to shape the school's programs. In 1963, new BSO Music Director Erich Leinsdorf took over the school's reins, returning to Koussevitzky's hands-on leadership approach while restoring a renewed emphasis on contemporary music. In 1970, three years before his appointment as BSO music director, Seiji Ozawa became head of the BSO's pro- grams at Tanglewood, with Gunther Schuller leading the TMC and Leonard Bernstein as gen- eral advisor. Leon Fleisher served as the TMC's Artistic Director from 1985 to 1997. In 1994, with the opening of Seiji Ozawa Hall, the TMC centralized its activities on the Leonard Bernstein Campus, which also includes the Aaron Copland Library, chamber music studios, administrative offices, and the Leonard Bernstein Performers Pavilion adjacent to Ozawa Hall. Ellen Highstein was appointed Director of the Tanglewood Music Center in 1997. %■ ^i... M//ron Babbitt, Elliott Carter, John Harbison, and TMC Fellows including conductor Tomasz Golka (standing at podium) during rehearsal for a 2006 TMC performance of Stravinsky's \"L'Histoire du soldat\" (photo: Hilary Scott) The 150 young performers and composers in the TMC's Fellowship Program — advanced musicians who generally have completed all or most of their formal training — participate in an intensive program including chamber and orchestral music, opera, and art song. All partic- ipants receive full fellowships covering tuition, room, and board. TMC Orchestra highlights this summer include Mahler's Symphony No. 3 conducted by Michael Tilson Thomas in the Koussevitzky Music Shed (July 17), and, in Seiji Ozawa Hall, works by Falla and Debussy led by Rafael Fruhbeck de Burgos (July 5) , Hindemith's Symphonic Metamorphoses on Themes of Weber led by Herbert Blomstedt (July 25), and Copland's Symphony No. 3 led by Robert Spano (August 16). In addition, a concert by the TMC Chamber Orches- tra will showcase performances by the TMC Conducting Fellows (July 12). Opera activities include a fully staged TMC producdon of Strauss's Ariadne aufNaxos with Christoph von Dohnanyi conducting (August 1, 2, and 4 in the Theatre) and concert versions of Oliver Knussen's Where the Wild Things Are and John Harbison's Full Moon in March as part of the 2010 Festival of Contemporary Music (August 15 in Ozawa Hall) . The Mark Morris Dance Group returns for its annual residency with performances by the company and TMC Fellows on June 27 and 28, including a new Mark Morris work choreographed to folksong arrangements by Beethoven and MMDG repertory works choreographed to music by Cowell, Chopin, and Harrison. TMC string play- ers start the season with a week-long intensive study of the string quartet, culminating in marathon concerts on June 27 and 28 in the Theatre. All of the TMC Fellows participate in chamber music programs in Ozawa Hall throughout the summer, notably on Sunday morn- ings at 10 a.m., and on Saturdays at 6 p.m. prior to BSO concerts. The Festival of Contemporary Music (FCM), an annual five-day celebration of the music of our time, will this year be the culmination of season-long programming celebrating the Tanglewood Music Center's 70th anniversary, and the seven decades of great composers who have taken a major role in its composition program teaching the next generation of composers and inspir- ing the next generation of performers. Directed and programmed collaboratively by Gunther Schuller, Oliver Knussen, and John Harbison, this year's six FCM concerts (August 12-16) will be a retrospective of great works of the twentieth and twenty-first centuries. It would be impossible to list all of the distinguished musicians who have studied at the Tanglewood Music Center. According to recent estimates, 20% of the members of American symphony orchestras, and 30% of all first-chair players, studied at the TMC. Prominent alumni of the Tanglewood Music Center include Claudio Abbado, Luciano Berio, Leonard Bernstein, Stephanie Blythe, William Bolcom, David Del Tredici, Christoph von Dohnanyi, Jacob Druckman, Lukas Foss, Michael Gandolfi, John Harbison, Gilbert Kalish, Oliver Knussen, Lorin Maazel, Wynton Marsalis, Zubin Mehta, Sherrill Milnes, Seiji Ozawa, Leontyne Price, Ned Rorem, Sanford Sylvan, Cheryl Studer, Michael Tilson Thomas, Dawn Upshaw, Shirley Verrett, and David Zinman. Today, alumni of the Tanglewood Music Center play a vital role in the musical life of the nation. Tanglewood and the Tanglewood Music Center, projects with which Serge Kousse- vitzky was involved until his death, have become a fitting shrine to his memory, a living embodiment of the vital, humanistic tradition that was his legacy. At the same time, the Tanglewood Music Center maintains its commitment to the future as one of the world's most important training grounds for the composers, conductors, instrumentalists, and vocalists of tomorrow. •V-r^ •i. .'

Florence Gould Florence Lacaze Gould, for whom the Florence Gould Auditorium in Seiji Ozawa Hall is named, was born in San Francisco to French parents in 1895. The San Francisco earthquake of 1906 destroyed her father's printing house, and the family returned to France. Florence arrived not speaking a word of French, but she was quick, intelligent, and musically gifted, and by the age of sixteen she was studying voice at the Paris Conservatory. Although she asserted throughout her life that she \"had not a drop of American blood,\" she remained a U.S. citizen until her death in 1983. Florence returned to San Francisco with her new husband, an American architect, at the outbreak of World War 1, but the marriage did not last and she returned to France in 1917. Following the Armisdce, she recommenced her musical studies, and was often to be found singing in the salons of Paris, along with the likes of the famous Parisian entertainer Collette. It was at such an event that she caught the eye of Frank Jay Gould, son of the American railroad magnate Jay Gould. The two were married in 1923 and, at her hus- band's request, Florence gave up her singing career. The Goulds were at the center of social life in the South of France during the 1920s and 1930s, where they attracted an international crowd of sociaHtes, artists, and writers. They remained in France throughout World War II, during which time Florence served as a nurse and estab- lished a famous literary salon that became a center of intellectual life in wartime Paris. It was also at this time that she became a patron of contemporary painters, Braque and Picasso among them, and began amassing an extraordinary collection of modern art. Frank Gould died in 1956, leaving an enormous fortune to his wife. Florence Gould contin- ued her philanthropy to the arts, and was awarded the Legion d'Honneur by French Presi- dent Charles de Gaulle in 1961. The guests of her salon tended no longer to be rebellious, avant-garde intellectuals, but, instead, great established personages, many of them members of the Academie. She also surrounded herself v«th the leading European and American art collectors, dealers, and cultural leaders. At the time of her death, her art collection included works by Bonnard, Cassat, Cezanne, Corot, Degas, Gaugin, Toulouse-Lautrec, Manet, Monet, Pissarro, Renoir, and Van Gogh. The majority of the proceeds from the sale of her estate was given to the Florence Gould Foundation, the principal purpose of which is to foster Franco- American amity and collaboration. The Florence Gould Foundation endowed the auditorium of Seiji Ozawa Hall, naming it in honor of Mrs. Gould, in 1990, and similarly has named other cultural facilities throughout the United States and in France. The Foundation also has endowed a Fellowship at the Tanglewood Music Center for the benefit of talented young French musicians.

Ye shepherds of this pleasant vale Ye shepherds of this pleasant vale, where Yarrow glides along, Forsake your rural toils and join in my triumphant song! She grants, she yields one heav'nly smile, atones her long delays, One happy minute crowns the pains of many suff ring days. Yarrow, how dear thy stream, thy beauteous banks how blest! For there 'twas first my loveliest maid, a mutual flame confest. Take, take whate'er of bliss or joy, you fondly fancy mine; whate'er of joy or bliss I boast, love renders wholly thine. The woods struck up to the soft gale, the leaves were seen to move, the feather'd choir resum'd their voice, and music fill'd the grove. Yarrow, how dear thy stream, thy beauteous banks how blest! For there 'twas first my loveliest maid, a mutual flame confest. HAMILTON 2. The sweetest lad was Jamie The sweetest lad was Jamie, the sweetest, the dearest, and well did Jamie love me, and not a fault has he. Yet one he had, it spoke his praise, he knew not woman's wish to teaze, he knew not all our silly ways, alas! the woe to me! So when the warpipes sounded, dear Jamie, he left me, and now some other maiden will Jamie turn to woo. My heart will break, and well it may, for who would word of pity say to her who threw a heart away, so faithful and so true!

Of all the days that's in the week, I dearly love but one day, and that's the day that comes between the Saturday and Monday, for then I'm drest all in my best to walk abroad with Sally. She is the darling of my heart and she lives in our alley. When Christmas comes about again, then I shall have money; I'll hoard it up, and box it all, and give it to my honey.

What shall I do to shew how much I love her? What shall I do to shew how much I love her? Thoughts that oppress me, o how can I tell? Will my soft passion be able to move her? Language is wanting, when loving so well. Can sighs and tears, in their silence, betoken half the distress this fond bosom must know? Or will she melt when a true heart is broken, weeping, too late, o'er her lost lover's woe. Is there a grace comes not playful before her? Is there a virtue, and not in her train? Is there a swain but delights to adore her? Pains she a heart but it boasts of her chain? Could I believe she'd prevent my undoing, life's gayest fancies the hope should renew; Or could I think she'd be pleas'd with my ruin, death should persuade her my sor- rows are true! ANONYMOUS 7.

When he began writing his mature pieces in the early twentieth century, the most accomplished composers of Spanish-tinged music all had been foreigners — Debussy, Ravel, Liszt, and Rimsky-Korsakov, among others. Like many other composers interested in writing nationalistic music, Falla sought a more genuine idiom by studying and assimilating the folk music of his homeland, incorporating traditional elements into his compositions to create authentic-sounding yet original works. El amor brujo (\"Love, the Magician\"), a piece that the composer arranged into three different versions between 1914 and 1925, tells the story of a gypsy who falls for a young man but must use ritual and magic to banish the jealous spirit of her dead husband before she can be free to pursue her new love. The present selection includes most of Falla's second version of the score (completed in 1916 for mezzo-soprano and orchestra), omitting two movements and all of the sung text. Though lessening the dramatic narrative, this purely orchestral version heightens the effect of the music, which is rich with orchestral color and pulses with dance-inspired rhythms. The Ritual Fire Dance in particular, an invigorat- ing four-minute symphonic romp, is Falla's most popular and instantly recognizable number and is frequently used as an encore piece. G^ Isaac Albeniz (1860-1909) \"Cordoba,\" from Cantos De Espana (orch. Fruhbeck) \"Granada,\" from Suite Espanola (orch. Fruhbeck) \"El corpus en Sevilla,\" from Iberia (orch. Arbos) Catalan composer Isaac Albeniz was one of the most brilliant pianists of his day, and though he gave up concertizing by 1890 to concentrate on composing, his skill as a pianist informed most of his output. Like Ravel's, Albeniz's piano music contains within it an already surpassingly rich textural and harmonic palette, offering a strong temptation for the would-be orchestrator, and a few well-known orchestra- tions by Enrique Fernandez Arbos, Carlos Surinach, and Rafael Fruhbeck de Burgos have found a place in the orchestral repertoire. Fruhbeck orchestrated seven of the pieces from Albeniz's Suite espanola in the mid-1960s, but to keep the travelogue within Spain itself he replaced the \"Cuba\" movement with \"Cordoba\" from the later Cantos de Espana. He employed a Ravel-sized ensemble for his coloristic translations — similar to the orchestra called for by Arbos for his early-20th-century Iberia arrangements. \"Cordoba\" takes its name from the Andalusian city. After an introspective opening, stopped horns (evoking bells) introduce a chant-like, archaic hymn leading to a lilting, dancing tune in 3/4 time with castanets keeping the beat. Quick arpeggios in the accompaniment mimic flamenco guitar (harp, abetted by castanets) . The chant melody briefly interrupts the dance, which returns in a concluding coda. \"Granada\" (another Andalusian city) , from Suite espanola, is a sweet serenata, or night-piece. The melodies in the flutes have a slightly exotic, ornamented quality redolent of Arab-influenced Andalusia. Listen also for the call-and-response between strings and brass. SEIJI OZAWA HALL PROGRAM NOTES 15 \"El Corpus en Sevilla,\" the third piece in Book I of Iberia, is an impression of the June Corpus Christi festival in Seville, during which the effigy of Christ is carried in procession through the streets. The piece begins as a march, gradually becoming less rhythmically strict. A lament song or saeta forms the middle part of the piece. The march returns until night calmly falls over the scene. ^^-> Nikolai Rimsky-Korsakov (1844-1908) \"Capriccio espagnol,\" Opus 34 Nicolai Rimsky-Korsakov — ^who never heard an orchestra until age twelve, originally pursued a career in the navy, and was largely self-educated as a musician and com- poser— ^was one of history's most innate orchestrators and taught virtually every sig- nificant Russian composer of the first half of the twentieth century. Capriccio espagnol, a five-movement suite based on Spanish folk songs, is a dazzling example of Rimsky- Korsakov's orchestral mastery; with its surging rhythms and sun-drenched radiance, few works can match it for sheer exhilaration dindjoie de vivre. The composer chafed at his reputation as a brilliant orchestrator, however, feeling that it short-changed him as a complete composer. In his autobiogra- phy, Rimsky-Korsakov writes of Capriccio espagnol: The opinion formed by both critics and the public, that the Capriccio is a magnificently orchestrated piece — is wrong. The Capriccio is a brilliant composi- tion fi)r the orchestra. The change of timbres, the felicitous choice of melodic designs and figuration patterns, exactly suiting each kind of instrument, brief virtuoso cadenzas for instruments solo, the rhythm of the percussion instruments, etc., constitute here the very essence of the composition and not its garb or orchestration. There is truth to his less-than-modest argument, and the piece does have abundant merits outside its scoring. The pacing is impeccable, never dallying too long on a single idea yet never feeling perfunctory. The intricate dynamic layering creates a constantly evolving dramatic tension, and the subtle variation of melodies allows for significant repetition without becoming tedious. More than anything, though, this music is pure fun; Rimsky-Korsakov freely admitted that \"the Capriccio is undoubted- ly a purely external piece.\" Luckily, solemn profundity is not the only path to musi- cal greatness. 16 .^ Claude Debussy (1862-1918) \"La Mer,\" Three symphonic sketches Of the countless musical works designed to depict aspects of nature, Debussy's La Mer is notable for its singular blend of majesty and mystery, capturing over the course of its three movements both the humbling enormity of the open sea and the gentle bustling of its minutiae. Composed largely in landlocked Burgundy between 1903 and 1905, La M^did not exactly emerge dripping with the salty spray of the ocean; Debussy wrote that he instead drew upon \"innumerable memories\" of the sea from his summers in Cannes as a child, memories that \"are worth more than a reality, which, charming as it may be, tends to weigh too heavily on the imagination.\" Like all of Debussy's work. La Mer certainly suffers no encumbrance of imagination. Though Debussy resented the comparison of his music to the Impressionist painters, La Mer is impressionistic in the most basic sense — it relies on no specific scenario or program to structure the music and offers a swirling nebula of musical ideas rather than a single, cohesive narrative. Debussy's ocean is a primordial, starkly elemental place. There is no human element — no noise of boat, ship, or swimmer — and no distinctive sound of birdsong or other wildlife. Debussy gives us water, wind, and waves, sunlight and darkness, and nothing more.
