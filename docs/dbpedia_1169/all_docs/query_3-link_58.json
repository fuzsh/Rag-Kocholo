        "text": "Out-of-date information\n\nThis page is no longer maintained and contains out-of-date information. Updated information can be found on the UAlbany History site.\n\nChronological History of the University at Albany, SUNY, 1844-2008\n\nby Geoffrey P. Williams, University Archivist Emeritus\n\nThe chronology is a work in progress undergoing continuous revision as new or more accurate information becomes available. For example, it has been commonly thought that the earliest known mention of the school colors, purple and gold, dated from 1907. The author recently discovered a reference to purple and gold as the school colors dating from 1896 and updated the chronology to reflect that change. It is essential that you consult the online Chronological History when confirming a date to make sure you have the most up-to-date information available. Currently, entries from 1844 through 1935 have been checked and updated for accuracy. Entries without citations or followed by ???? means there is some doubt as to the validity of the entry should be confirmed with Geoffrey Williams, University Archivist Emeritus. The chronology represents the author's personal view of what is important in the University's history based on questions received in the University Archives. The Chronological History is intended to give brief information about a subject and pointers to fuller sources of information. Any errors or omissions are the responsibility of the author.\n\nUsing the Chronological History: Most 19th Century entries are simply listed in chronological order during the year they occured. As the entries become more numerous, the entries for each year are divided into sub-categories, again listed in chronological order when an exact date is known. Among the sub-catagories are: Academic Colleges, Departments & Schools; Academic Degrees and Certificates; Academic Programs; Administration; Centers & Institutes; General; Gifts; Grants; Alumni Affairs; and Student Life.\n\nSearching the Chronology: You can search by decade or use the Edit command and Find. Simple one word searches work best. Example: If you are interested in David Page, just search Page. You may get a few extra hits but you will also find buildings named after Page long after his death.\n\nOther Histories: Readers who want a fuller history of the University should consult the three major published histories of the school: Kendall Birr, A Tradition of Excellence: The Sesquicentennial History of the University at Albany, State University of New York, 1844 to 1994 (Virginia Beach, VA: The Donning Company, 1994); William Marshall French and Florence Smith French, College of the Empire State, A Centennial History of the New York State College for Teachers at Albany [Albany, 1944]; and David Woodworth Martin, The Liberal Arts in the Curricula for the Preparation of Teachers at the State University of New York at Albany, 1844-1966 (The University of Connecticut, 1967), or an excellent unpublished history: W. Paul Vogt, The State University of New York at Albany, 1844-1984, A Short History (c. State University of New York at Albany, 1984). Copies of these works, along with a number of other specialized histories, are held in the M. E. Grenander Department of Special Collections and Archives Research Room.\n\nUniversity Names\n\nPresidents & Principals\n\nPrincipals\n\nPresidents\n\nChronological History\n\nFounding in 1844\n\n1844\n\nMay 7th--The State Normal School created by legislature to train teachers for the Common Schools of N. Y. S. It was the 4th state normal school in the country, the first in N. Y. S., and the first outside of Massachusetts. The school was financed by a $9,600.00 grant from the Literature Fund for the first year and $10,000.00 per year for the following five years. It was regarded as an experiment which could be canceled in the future. The State Normal School remained the only \"State\" normal school in N.Y. till 1866 when the N. Y. S. took over the municipal normal school at Oswego. The State Normal School was under the joint control of the Secretary of State and the Regents. (William Marshall French & Florence Smith French, College of the Empire State: A Centennial History of the New York State College for Teachers at Albany [Albany, NY, 1944], pp. 38, 45, 72, hereafter cited as French. A photograph of the original legislation is in the Archives Photo File.)\n\nJune 1--The Executive Committee, forerunner of our current University Council, holds its first meeting. The first members of the Committee were Colonel Samuel Young, chairman (Secretary of State and Superintendent of the Common Schools), Regent Gideon Hawley, Francis Dwight, Rev. Dr. Alonzo Potter, and Rev. William H. Campbell (State Normal School at Albany. Executive Committee Minutes (transcription), Vol. I, p.1, hereafter cited as Exec. Comm.

(Need to check to see if earlier version.)\n\nDecember 18--The first classes were held at the State Normal School's temporary building, former Mohawk & Hudson Railway Building, later known as Van Vechten Hall, located at 115-121 State Street. The buildingâs second and third floors were donated by City of Albany rent free for five years. The City also donated $500.00 to renovate the building. Van Vechten Hall was demolished in the early nineteen-sixties for construction of the IBM Building. The initial enrollment was 29 students taught by two faculty: David Page and George R. Perkins. By the end of the session 98 students were in attendance, \"an equal number from each sex\". State students, those nominated by County Superintendents, receive free tuition and a $.03 pre-mile travel allowance from their home paid at the end of the term. Sixty-nine \"State Pupils\" were registered by the end of the 1st term. State students also received a weekly room & board allowance, $1.25 for women, $1.00 for men. (French, pp. 53-54, 59; Figures on students from French and Report of the Executive Committee of the State Normal School to the Superintendent of the Common Schools and Regents of the University of New York, January 14, 1846, p. 5; for the demolition of Van Vechten Hall see Permit No. 108358, 1964, Building Department Permit Indexes, A-Z, 1962, Albany County Hall of Records)\n\n1845\n\nFebruary 20--James L. Wadsworth donates $300.00 in his will to purchase books on the Library List for the schoolâs Miscellanea Library accepted by the Executive Committee. Wadsworth was a prominent land developer and advocate of school libraries in NYS. This was the first private donation to the school. Other books and maps worth $600.00 were donate by book publishers.(Exec. Comm. Minutes, vol. I, pp. 17 & 21; French, p. 66)\n\nApril 4--The Executive Committee mandates that all student be required to sign a âDeclaration of Teachingâ--a pledge to teach in NYS district schools. (Exec. Comm. Minutes, vol. I, p. 20) The pledge to teach was not abandoned until 1962.\n\nMay 2--The first librarian, Darwin G. Eaton, was appointed. Eaton was a student. (Exec. Comm. Minutes, vol. I, p. 21)\n\n--The Experimental School opened. The Experimental School would become the Milne School and last as a teaching laboratory till 1977. Reputed to be one of the, if not the first, practice-teaching school in the country. Forty-five pupils enrolled in first class. (Ann. Report of the Executive Committee, January 16, 1846, p. 17)\n\nAugust 27--The first graduation ceremony was held. Thirty-four students awarded diplomas. (Ann. Rpt. Exec. Comm., Jan. 27, 1846, p. 14).\n\n1848\n\nJanuary 1--Principal David Page dies. Page Hall on the Downtown Campus was named for Principal Page in 1929. Among Pageâs achievements were designing a curriculum that remained largely unchanged until 1890, securing the support of the legislature for the new experiment in teacher training, and securing legislation that allowed every recipient of a Normal School diploma to teach in the State of New York. (Exec. Comm. Minutes, Jan. 1, 1848, Vol. 1, p. 70; French, p. 92)\n\nJanuary 12--George R. Perkins, LL.D., the first faculty member hired at the Normal School, appointed principal effective Jan. 1. (Exec. Comm.

The City of Albany donates the old fire house on the corner. The following year the State appropriated another $10,000.00 to complete the building and a further $3,500.00 for furnishings. The main entrance of the building faced Lodge Street. (Annual Report of Executive Committee, Feb. 11, 1850, p. 9) See the Annual Report of the Executive Committee, 1850 for a print of the new building by Richard H. Pease, the floor plans, as well as a description of the design of the building for the building. George J. Penchard of firm of Perkins & Penchard, was the architect, . (Exec. Comm. Minutes, March 28, 1848, Vol. 1, p. 83) For the exact location of the building see Map of the City of Albany with Villages of Greenbush, East Albany, & Bath. Sprague & Co. Surveyed and drawn by E. Jacobs, 1857. Albany County Hall of Records.)\n\n1849\n\nApril 11--By act of the Legislature \"Every teacher shall be deemed a qualified teacher who shall have in possession a diploma of the State Normal school.\" (Annual Register and Circular of the State Normal School, Albany, N. Y., for the year ending July 31, 1851, p. 37, Appendix A of the Annual Report of the Executive Committee of the State Normal School to the Legislature, in Senate, No. 34, January 12, 1852)\n\nJuly 31--The Normal School moves to new permanent building at the Corner of Lodge & Howard Streets. (Ann. Rpt. Exec. Comm., April 12, 1852, p. 3; French, pp. 93-94). This building was occupied by the School until 1885. It was demolished in 1949. (Alumni Quarterly, Jan. 1949, p. 2)\n\nSeptember 26--The Association of Graduates of the New York State Normal School was formed by William Phelps, SNS â45, supervisor of the Practice School, 1845-52, Silas Bowen, SNS '45, Teacher of Intellectual Philosophy, 1845-53, and William W. Clark, â45, Teacher of Natural Philosophy and Chemistry, 1845-51. The Association is the direct predecessor of current Alumni Association. The Association, lead by Corresponding Secretary William Phelps â45, maintains a record of the address and profession of graduates. Phelps set up an educational placement bureau for the Normal School through the Association of Graduates. The Associationâs members were also seen as a ginger group to give political support the Executive Committeeâs plans for the Normal School. The Association meets biannually. With Phelpsâ departure in 1852 the Association lost its driving force and appeared by be primarily a mechanism for organizing reunions. Reunions were held in 1851, 1853, 1857, 1859. Reunions were canceled during the Civil War and not very successfully renewed in the late sixties. They were held in 1867, 1868, 1870, and 1872. (For the founding of the Association of Graduates see the Annual Report of the Executive Committee of the State Normal School to the Assembly, Jan. 3, 1850, pp. 8-9, 22-25. For a list of reunion dates see French, p. 108. For the first Constitution of the Association of Graduates see Appendix C, Annual Report of the Executive Committee, January 3, 185[1])\n\n1850s\n\n1850\n\nSamuel Randall, Esq. donates 250 books to establish the Experimental School library. (For Youth & the State, p. 11)\n\nMarch 23--1850 The Legislature passes âAn act to provide for the support and education of a limited number of Indian youth of the State of New York, at the State Normal School.â (Annual Report of the Executive Committee of the State Normal School, January 3, 1851, p. 7; French, p. 94-95)\n\nMay--Nine Native American pupils were admitted, three women and six men, including Caroline, Nicholson & Newton Parker, all of Pembroke, Lucia Green and Mary Jemison of Cattaurugus, Levi Williams of Collins, Thomas Webster of Lenox, and Honues Neddy of Onondaga. (Indian Pupils list, Appendix B,Annual Report of the Executive Committee, January 3, 1851, p. 21) Between 1850 and 1853 at total of twenty-five Native American students attended the Normal School or its Experimental School. None were listed as graduates of the school and on July 21, 1853 the Legislature passed a bill, at the urging of the Executive Committee, providing for the education of Indian pupils at academies instead of the Normal School. (French, p. 94-95; Annual Report of the Executive Committee of the State Normal School, Dec. 31, 1853, p. 6-7) See also Harriet Twoguns, class of 1865.\n\n1851\n\nMarch--Leo S. Root returns $75.00 to the School in compensation for not teaching as per his signed pledge. Root was freed of his moral obligation to teach by action of the Executive Committee. (Executive Committee Minutes, March 14, 1851, . I, p. 115) He pursued a career as a manufacturing, analytic and consulting chemist. (Historical Sketch...., 1894, p. 135)\n\n1852\n\nJuly 8--Principal George R. Perkins submits letter of resignation on May 17 effective July 8 to become mathematician for the New York Central Railroad. (Exec. Comm. Minutes, May 17, 1852, Vol. 1, p. 160)\n\nSeptember 20--Samuel B. Woolworth, LL.D. assumes principalâs position. (Exec. Comm. Minutes, July 1, 1852, Vol. I, p. 164) Woolworth was the first college graduate to be appointed principal. He introduced departmental concentrations for teachers but was unsuccessful in his attempt to introduce the lecture method which the Executive Committee rejected as promoting inattention. (French, p. 95-96)\n\n1854\n\nSuperintendent of Experimental School and Director of Practice Teaching appointed. (For Youth & the State, p. 11)\n\n1856\n\nJanuary 31--Oldest extant Commencement Program. (Bound with Executive Committee Minutes, Feb. 7, 1851 [originals], Vol. 1, p. 219)\n\nFebruary 1--Principal Samuel B. Woolworth resigns effective Feb. 1 to become Secretary to the Board of Regents and a member of the Executive Committee of the Normal School. As a Secretary of the Regents, Woolworth would introduce the Regents Exams. (French, pp. 95- 97; Executive Committee Minutes, January 4, 1856, Vol. I, p. 234) Woolworth would serve as acting principal of the school in 1867 upon the resignation of Oliver Arey, becoming the first person to lead the institution twice.\n\nFebruary 25--David Cochran, A.M., Ph.D. appointed principal. (Exec. Comm. Minutes, January 21, 1856, Vol. I, p. 236) Cochran was born in Springville, N.Y., July 28, 1828, a graduate of Hamilton College, class 1850, taught at Clinton Liberal Institute and subsequently served as principal of Fredonia Academy before his appointment as Professor of Natural Science at the State Normal School in September 1854. (âObituary, David H. Cochran, Ph.D., LL.D,â The Echo, November 1909, p. 73)\n\n1858-59\n\nCharlotte V. Usher--The first African-American student attends the Normal School. There is no record of her graduation and no indication in our records that Usher was African-American. Information about her being African American come solely from Carlton Maybee, Black Education in New York State, p. 312, fn. 10.\n\nSeptemberââCallisthenicsâ first appear in the âProgram of Exercises.â Callisthenics and Sub-Lectures were held from 12:40-1:15 replacing what had been a rest period. On December 1st the Executive Committee give the principal permission to hire the first instructor of âCallisthenics & Gymnasticsâ, I. L. Montgomery. Montgomery was never listed with the regular faculty of the school so he must have served as an adjunct. Callisthenics continued to appear in the âProgram of Exercisesâ through the fall of 1862. The Annual Report of the Executive Committee for February 10, 1863 noted the steep decline of male students and the program of exercised for the Fall limited Calisthenics and Sub-Lectures to ten minutes in the second of three fall terms. No subsequent âProgrammeâ mentions Calisthenics during the 19th Century. In the April of 1861 âmilitary drillâ was added to the gymnastic exercises for men. Military drill was lauded in the 1862 Annual Report for âimportant points of superiority over gymnastics. Its effect on the carriage, its tendency to produce a habit of subordination, and its power to create the highest precision and promptness in action, have been shown to be of the first order.â Military drill was conducted by Professors Husted and Kimball until they resigned to lead the Normal School Company in the Civil War. (âProgram of Exercises,â Appendix B, Documents Accompanying the Annual Report of the Executive Committee, January 19, 1859, p. 28-30; Exec. Comm. Min., December 1, 1859; Annual Report of the Executive Committee, Feb. 4, 1862, p. 9; Annual Report of the Executive Committee, February 10, 1863, p. 7-8, and Appendix B Programmes of Exercises, p. 38)\n\n1860s\n\n1860\n\nSTUDENT LIFE\n\nJanuary 27--Literary Societies of the State Normal School hold semi-annual exercises. This is the first record of a literary society at the school. At the time two societies for males existed, the Excelsior Society and the Independent Association. No mention of a womenâs literary society appears until the early 1870s. (\"Program, Semi-Annual Exercises of the Literary Societies of the State Normal School, January 27, 1860.\" Commencement Program Binder, 1857-1917, Office of President Records)\n\n1861\n\nSeptember--Primary Department created an Experimental School as a separate department. The department prepared students age five to seven using the Pestalozzian or object method of teaching. All female Normal School students spent one week in the department and one hour per week discussing the training method. The first supervisor of the department was Lydia K. Keyes SNS â54. A tuition of $20.00 a year was charged per pupil. (Annual Report of the Executive Committee, February 6, 1863, p. 11, and accompanying Annual Register and Circular of the State Normal School for the Year ending July 10, 1862, p. 35; For Youth & The State, p. 11) French indicates that the Juvenile Department was open in 1862. This appears to be a misreading of the record. (French, p. 100)\n\n1862\n\nSeptember--Normal School Company formed to fight in the Civil War. Led by Lieutenant, subsequently Captain, Albert N. Husted, SNS â45, and Captain Rodney Kimball, the Company fought at Fredricksburg, Chancellorsville, Gettysburg, Wilderness, Spottsville, and Cold Harbor. (Husted Hall was named for Husted in 1927. Husted served as a teacher and subsequently professor of Mathematics of the Normal School/Normal College from September 17, 1855 until his resignation to lead the Normal School Company on July 12, 1862. He was rehired on November 4, 1864 and served continuously as a faculty member until his death on October 16, 1912. He served an interim appointment as principal on the death of President Alden in 1889. Of one hundred original volunteers, seventeen died of wounds, eight of disease, and five were commissioned as officers in African-American regiments. For a brief account of the Companyâs activities see A. N. Hustedâs account of the Companyâs service in A Historical Sketch of the State Normal School at Albany, N.Y. and a History of Its Graduates for Forty Years (Albany: Brandow & Barton, 1884), pp. xii-xv.\n\n1863\n\nJanuary 23--Literary Societies hold semi-annual exercises. The renamed Independent Order of Normals (I.O.N.) [formerly Independent Association] and Ex Society, both male student organizations, again hold exercises. (See \"Semi-Annual Exercises of the Literary Societies of the State Normal School,\" Commencement Programs Binder, 1857-1917, President's Office Records)\n\n1864\n\nSeptember 19--Principal David Cochran submits his resignation to accept the presidency of Polytechnic Institute in Brooklyn, N.Y. At the State Normal School Cochran introduced object-teaching or Pestalozzianism to the school curriculum. The teaching method was used in a new Juvenile Department opened in 1861. The exact date Cochranâs resignation took effect is unclear as he agreed to stay until a successor took office. He remained principal until early December and perhaps into January of 1864. (Cochran to Executive Committee, September 19, 1864, Minutes of the Executive Committee, Sept. 19, 1864, Vol. I, p. 295-6; decision to appoint Oliver Arey Principal, Dec. 2, 1864, Vol I, p. 298; and January 12, 1865, Vol I, p. 299. The latter minutes indicate that Arey accepted the principalship but leaves blank the date at which he actually started work. (French, p. 99-101) Cochran served as President of Brooklyn Polytechnic Institute from 1864 until his retirement in 1899. He continued to be involved with the State Normal School until at least 1900 when he spoke at the dedication of the Soldiersâ Memorial Tablet honoring the Normal School dead in the Civil War. Cochran died in Brooklyn on October 6, 1909. (âObituary, David H. Cochran, Ph.D., LL.D,â The Echo, November 1909, p. 73)\n\nDecember 2--Oliver Arey, A.M., is appointed principal by Executive Committee to start at earliest possible date. (Exec. Comm. Minutes, Dec. 2, 1864, Vol I, p. 298)\n\n1865\n\nJanuary 12[?]--Oliver Arey assumes office of Principal. The Executive Committee Minutes of January 12, 1865, leave the impression that Arey did not take office until the new year. (Exec. Comm. Minutes, Vol. I, p. 299) The local newspapers should be checked to see whether there is notice of Cochranâs departure and Areyâs arrival!!\n\nJuly 13--Harriet E. Twoguns of the Cattaraugus Reservation graduates, the first Native American student to do so. Twoguns taught African-American children in the south for twenty years after graduation. (Historical Sketch, 1894, p. 204) Harriet Twogunsâ descendent, Lee Leroy, received a Distinguished Alumni Award in her honor in 1971. (Carillon, Summer 1971, p. 1)\n\n1867\n\nJanuary 8âPrincipal Oliver Areyâs resignation accepted by the Executive Committee on January 8 effective as of the end of the term. Arey's term as principal was marked by a dispute with the faculty, the nature of which remains unclear. (Exec. Comm. Minutes, January 8, 1867, Vol. I, p. 319; French, pp. 101-102 details charges against Arey by faculty and counter charges filed by Arey, all of which were withdrawn from the official record.)\n\nFebruary 19--The Secretary to the Executive Committee, Samuel B. Woolworth, a former Principal, appointed Principal until a permanent Principal can be selected. Woolworth became the only person to lead the institution twice. (Exec. Comm. Minutes, Feb. 19, 1867, Vol. I, p. 320-21)\n\nApril 3--Joseph Alden, D.D., LL.D., becomes the schoolâs first president. Alden was informally hired on April 3 to begin work on April 22. The change in title from principal to president was approved by the Executive Committee at its July 8 meeting. (Exec. Comm. Minutes, July 8, 1867, Vol. I, p. 325)\n\n1870s\n\n1870\n\nSTUDENT LIFE\n\nPhilomathean Society, young ladies literary society, founded ca. 1870. From programs for a Ladies Literary Society dating from 1873, it appears that the Philomathean Society may have been a later name for the Ladies Literary Society. (Literary Societies folder; Archives Vertical File; Echo, Sept. 1893, p. 11)\n\n1872\n\nALUMNI ASSOCIATION\n\nJuly 2--The Association of Graduates is revived. William J. Ballard, SNS â70, is elected president, Oscar Myers, SNS â70, is elected vice president, Charles J. Majory, SNS â72, is elected treasurer, and Sherman Williams, SNS â71, is elected secretary. The new leadership resolved to query graduates about forming a new Association which would meet once a year. The annual meeting would feature literary exercises including an oration, a poem, a historical essay, and addresses by the president and vice president. (Biennial Meeting Minutes, July 2, 1872, Alumni Association Minutes, 1872-1917, p, 1-2. Alumni Association Records)\n\n1873\n\nALUMNI ASSOCIATION\n\nJune 30--The first annual meeting of the renewed Association of Graduates is held and a new constitution is adopted. The object of the Association is to âcontinue the social relations among the graduates, to enable them to know, or to learn at any time the whereabouts of one another and present at its regular meetings such exercises as shall best conduce to these ends.â The constitution established a differential fee, $.75 per year for men, and $.25 per year for women. Meetings were set for the close of the summer term.(Constitution of the Association of Graduates of the New York State Normal School, Article II, Article IV, section V, and Article V. Annual Meeting Minutes, June 30, 1873, Alumni Association Minutes, 1872-1917, pp. 3-6)\n\n1874\n\nALUMNI ASSOCIATION\n\nDecember 30--At the second Annual Meeting Alumni Association dues were raised to $1.00 for men and $.50 for women. In 1879 the dues returned to $.75 for men and $.25 for women. The Annual Meeting time shifted to the week between Christmas and New Year. Sherman Williams, secretary, launches an effort to identify every graduate of the school. (Annual Meeting Minutes, December 30, 1874, Alumni Association Minutes, 1872-1917, pp.12-13; Annual Meeting Minutes, December 30, 1879, Alumni Association Minutes, 1872-1917, p.23)\n\n1877\n\nJune 28--Sensaburo Kudzo, the first international student, graduates. Kudzo played a prominent role in establishing the normal school movement in Japan. He was an expert on western music. (Historical Sketch, 1894, p. 254; Kudzo Folder in Archives Vertical File) No other international students are known to have attended the school until 1908.\n\n1880s\n\n1880\n\nKate Stoneman, teacher of penmanship at the Normal School, SNC graduate, Class of 1866, and a group of suffragists, successfully lobbies the NYS legislature to allow women to elect local school boards. Women were still barred from voting in the all other elections. In 1886 Ms. Stoneman is admitted to the bar after successfully lobbying the NYS Legislature and the Governor to have women admitted to the bar. She became the first woman lawyer in New York.
