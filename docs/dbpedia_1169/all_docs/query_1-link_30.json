        "text": "Mary Tyler Moore was born in Flatbush, Brooklyn, on December 29, 1936. Moore's family relocated to California when she was eight. Her childhood was troubled, due in part to her mother's alcoholism. The eldest of three siblings, she attended a Catholic high school and married upon her graduation, in 1955. Her only child, Richard Meeker Jr., was born soon after.\n\nA dancer at first, Moore's first break in show business was in 1955, as a dancing kitchen appliance - Happy Hotpoint, the Hotpoint Appliance elf, in commercials generally broadcast during the popular sitcom The Adventures of Ozzie and Harriet (1952). She then shifted from dancing to acting and work soon came, at first a number of guest roles on television series, but eventually a recurring role as Sam, Richard Diamond's sultry answering service girl, on Richard Diamond, Privatdetektiv (1956), her performance being particularly notorious because her legs (usually dangling a pump on her toe) were shown instead of her face.\n\nAlthough these early roles often took advantage of her willowy charms (in particular, her famously-beautiful dancer's legs), Moore's career soon took a more substantive turn as she was cast in two of the most highly regarded comedies in television history, which would air first-run for most of the '60s and '70s. In the first of these, Dick van Dyke Show (1961), Moore played Laura Petrie, the charmingly loopy wife of star Dick Van Dyke. The show became famous for its very clever writing and terrific comic ensemble - Moore and her fellow performers received multiple Emmy Awards for their work. Meanwhile, she had divorced her first husband, and married advertising man (and, later, network executive) Grant Tinker.\n\nAfter the end of Dick van Dyke Show (1961), Moore focused on movie-making, co-starring in five between the end of the sitcom and the start of Oh Mary (1970), including Modern Millie - Reicher Mann gesucht (1967), in which she plays a ditsy aspiring actress, and an inane Elvis Presley vehicle, Ein himmlischer Schwindel (1969), in which she plays a nun-to-be and love interest for Presley. Also included in this mixed bag of films was a first-rate television movie, Vergiß oder stirb (1969), which was an early showcase for Moore's considerable talent at dramatic acting.\n\nAfter trying her hand at movies for a few years, Moore decided, rather reluctantly, to return to television, but on her terms. The result was Oh Mary (1970), which was produced by MTM Enterprises, a company she had formed with Tinker, and which later went on to produce scores of other television series. Moore starred as Mary Richards, who moves to Minneapolis on the heels of a failed relationship. Mary finds work at the newsroom of WJM-TV, whose news program is the lowest-rated in the city, and establishes fast friendships with her colleagues and her neighbors. The sitcom was a commercial and critical success and for years was a fixture of CBS television's unbeatable Saturday night line-up. Moore and Tinker were determined from the start to make the sitcom a cut above the average, and it certainly was - instead of going for a barrage of gags, the humor took longer to develop and arose out of the interaction between the characters in more realistic situations. This was also one of the earliest television portrayals of a woman who was happy and successful on her own rather than simply being a man's wife. Oh Mary (1970) is generally included amongst the finest television series ever produced in America.\n\nMoore ended the sitcom in 1977, while it was still on a high point, but found it difficult to flee the beloved Mary Richards persona - her subsequent attempts at television series, variety programs, and specials (such as the mortifying disco-era Mary's Incredible Dream (1976)) usually failed, but even her dramatic work, which is generally excellent, fell under the shadow of Mary Richards. With time, however, her body of dramatic acting came to be recognized on its own, with such memorable work as in Eine ganz normale Familie (1980), as an aloof WASP mother who not-so-secretly resents her younger son's survival; in Finnegan Begin Again (1985), as a middle-aged widow who finds love with a man whose wife is slowly slipping away, in Lincoln (1988), as the troubled Mary Todd Lincoln, and in Mütter ohne Skrupel (1993), as an infamous baby smuggler (for which she won her sixth Emmy Award). She also inspired a new appreciation for her famed comic talents in Flirting with Disaster - Ein Unheil kommt selten allein (1996), in which she is hilarious as the resentful adoptive mother of a son who is seeking his birth parents. Moore also acted on Broadway, and she won a Tony Award for her performance in \"Whose Life Is It Anyway?\"\n\nWidely acknowledged as being much tougher and more high-strung than her iconic image would suggest, Moore had a life with more than the normal share of ups and downs. Both of her siblings predeceased her, her sister Elizabeth of a drug overdose in 1978 and her brother John of cancer in 1991 after a failed attempt at assisted suicide, Moore having been the assistant. Moore's troubled son Richie shot and killed himself in what was officially ruled an accident in 1980. Moore was diagnosed an insulin-dependent diabetic in 1969, and had a bout with alcoholism in the early 1980s. Divorced from Tinker in 1981 after repeated separations and reconciliations, she married physician Robert Levine in 1983. The union with Levine proved to be Moore's longest run in matrimony and her only marriage not to end in divorce. Despite the opening credits of Oh Mary (1970), in which she throws a package of meat into her shopping cart, Moore was a vegetarian and a proponent of animal rights. She was an active spokesperson for both diabetes issues and animal rights.\n\nOn January 25, 2017, Mary Tyler Moore died at age 80 at Greenwich Hospital in Greenwich, Connecticut, from cardiopulmonary arrest complicated by pneumonia after having been placed on a respirator the previous week. She was laid to rest during a private ceremony at Oak Lawn Cemetery in Fairfield, Connecticut.\n\nThe legendary actress set a record when at age 82, she appeared on Dancing with the Stars (2005). Cloris Leachman was born on April 30, 1926 in Des Moines, Iowa to Berkeley Claiborne \"Buck\" Leachman and the former Cloris Wallace. Her father's family owned a lumber company, Leachman Lumber Co. She was of Czech (from her maternal grandmother) and English descent. After graduating from high school, Leachman attended Illinois State University and Northwestern University, where she majored in drama. After winning the title of Miss Chicago 1946 (as part of the Miss America pageant), she acted with the Des Moines Playhouse before moving to New York.\n\nLeachman made her credited debut in 1948 in an episode of The Ford Theatre Hour (1948) and appeared in many television anthologies and series before becoming a regular on The Bob & Ray Show (1951) in 1952. Her movie debut was memorable, playing the doomed blonde femme fatale Christina Bailey in Robert Aldrich's classic noir Rattennest (1955). Other than a role in Rod Serling's movie Anklage: Hochverrat (1956) in support of Paul Newman, Leachman remained a television actress throughout the 1950s and the 1960s, appearing in only two movies during the latter decade, Der Chapman-Report (1962) and Butch Cassidy und Sundance Kid (1969). Though she would win an Oscar for Peter Bogdanovich's adaptation of Larry McMurtry's Die letzte Vorstellung (1971) and appear in three Mel Brooks movies, it was in television that her career remained and her fame was assured in the 1970s and into the second decade of the new millennium.\n\nLeachman was nominated five times for an Emmy Award playing Phyllis Lindstrom, Mary Tyler Moore's landlady and self-described best friend on Oh Mary (1970) and on the spin-off series Phyllis (1975). She won twice as Best Supporting Actress in a comedy for her \"Mary Tyler Moore\" gig and won a Golden Globe Award as a leading performer in comedy for \"Phyllis\", but her first Emmy Award came in the category Outstanding Single Performance by an Actress in a Leading Role in 1973 for the television movie A Brand New Life (1973). She also won two Emmy Awards as a supporting player for Malcolm mittendrin (2000).\n\nShe was married to director-producer George Englund from 1953 to 1979. They had five children together. Cloris Leachman died of natural causes on January 27, 2021 in Encinitas, California.\n\nBonnie Franklin, of the freckled, fair-skinned, hazel-eyed, rosy-cheeked, carrot-haired variety, could light up a room with her buoyant, folksy personality, but she could be quite serious in a take-charge manner when it came to purposeful acting work. It took Norman Lear and a highly popular TV sitcom to finally make the 31-year-old performer a household star in the mid-1970s.\n\nShe was born Bonnie Gail Franklin in Santa Monica, California on January 6, 1944, the daughter of Samuel Benjamin, an investment banker, and Claire (née Hersch) Franklin, both of Jewish descent. She was thrust onto the stage at a very young age as a child tap dancer and became the protégé of consummate tapper Donald O'Connor. At age 9, she performed with O'Connor on NBC's The Colgate Comedy Hour (1950). A year later, she performed as one of the Cratchit daughters in the Shower of Stars (1954) TV version of \"A Christmas Carol\", starring Fredric March and Basil Rathbone as \"Scrooge\" and \"Marley\", respectively. The young girl then appeared, unbilled on film, playing sweet young things in the rural comedy, The Kettles in the Ozarks (1956), Alfred Hitchcock's Der falsche Mann (1956) and the Sandra Dee/Troy Donahue's box office tearjerker, Die Sommerinsel (1959).\n\nAt age 13, the family moved from Santa Monica to upper-scale Beverly Hills. Graduating from Beverly Hills High School in 1961, Bonnie studied at Smith College for a time where the freshman co-ed acted in an Amherst College production of \"Good News\". She then transferred to UCLA and majored in English. Following her studies, she returned to TV and appeared in lightweight comedies that welcomed her perky, pixie-like presence. These included mid-to-late 1960s episodes of Mr. Novak (1963), Gidget (1965), Solo für O.N.K.E.L. (1964), Unser trautes Heim (1965) and Die Munsters (1964). In 1967, she married Ronald Sossi, a playwright best-known for his writing/producing chores on the TV series, The Rat Patrol (1966). The marriage, however, was short-lived and ended in 1970.\n\nIt was on the musical stage that Bonnie found breakthrough success. Following diligent work in \"Drat the Cat!\" (1965), \"Your Own Thing\" (1968), \"George M.!\" (1969) and \"Dames at Sea\" (1969), she took her first Broadway curtain call in \"Applause\", the well-received 1970 musical version of Alles über Eva (1950), starring Lauren Bacall. Bonnie played a theater \"gypsy\", named \"Bonnie\", who sings and dances to the title song backed by her \"band of gypsies\". Bonnie won the Outer Critics and Theatre World awards and a 1970 Tony nomination for her effort here. She continued on the stage with prime roles in \"A Thousand Clowns\" (1971), the title role in \"Peter Pan\" (1973), and the revue \"Oh, Coward!\" (1975).\n\nIt wasn't until Bonnie was handed the prime role of \"Ann Romano\", a divorced mom raising two daughters (Mackenzie Phillips and Valerie Bertinelli) on One Day at a Time (1975), did she become a viable star. Although her contagious cheerfulness and beaming smile was part of her value on the comedy show, Franklin desired to focus on taboo TV subjects such as divorce, birth control, sexual harassment and suicide, as well as getting laughs. While the program didn't match the ground-breaking importance or success of an Es bleibt in der Familie (1971), the show did command consistent and respectable ratings (\"Top 20\" for seven of its nine years) and lasted on CBS until 1984. Bonnie received one Emmy nomination and two Golden Globe nominations during the sitcom's run, and managed to find time to squeeze in a few other TV-movie projects as well -- A Guide for the Married Woman (1978), Breaking Up Is Hard to Do (1979), the title role in Portrait of a Rebel: The Remarkable Mrs. Sanger (1980) and Your Place... or Mine (1983). Bonnie also directed episodes of One Day at a Time (1975), Karen's Song (1987) Charles in Charge (1984) and Familie Munster (1987).\n\nFollowing the show's demise, Bonnie seemed to keep a lower profile on camera, focusing instead on theatre roles and in several humanitarian efforts. Sporadic guest roles on Burkes Gesetz (1994) (revived), Zwei Singles im Doppelbett (1995) and Ein Hauch von Himmel (1994) was highlighted by a 2005 TV reunion with her One Day at a Time (1975) TV family, The One Day at a Time Reunion (2005). Her return to the theatre, after a break of 14 years, included roles in a variety of plays: \"Happy Birthday and Other Humiliations\" (1987), \"Annie Get Your Gun\" (1988) (as \"Annie Oakley\"), \"Frankie and Johnny in the Clair de Lune\" (1988), \"Love and Guilt and the Meaning of Life\" (1990), \"Grace & Glorie\" (1996), \"All I Need to Know I Learned in Kindergarten\" (1997), \"Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf?\" (1999), \"Same Time, Next Year\" (2000), \"Dancing at Lughnasa\" (2003), \"A Touch of the Poet\" (2005), \"A Delicate Balance\" (2007) and as crotchety \"Ouisar\" in \"Steel Magnolias\" (2011). In addition, she put together and toured in her own cabaret act and appeared in nearly a dozen staged readings with Los Angeles' Classic and Contemporary American Playwrights.\n\nBonnie was a tireless activist for a variety of charities and civic-oriented issues, among them AIDS care and research and the Stroke Association of Southern California. More recently, Bonnie reunited with \"One Day at a Time\" daughter Valerie Bertinelli in a 2011 episode of Bertinelli's sitcom, Hot in Cleveland (2010), and, a year later, played a recurring nun in the daytime Schatten der Leidenschaft (1973).\n\nIn September of 2012, Bonnie was diagnosed with pancreatic cancer and died several months later on March 1, 2013. Her second husband of 29 years, TV/film producer Marvin Minoff, who produced Bonnie's TV movie, Portrait of a Rebel: The Remarkable Mrs. Sanger (1980), as well as the film, Patch Adams (1998), died in 2009.\n\nValerie Bertinelli was born in Wilmington, Delaware, to Nancy (Carvin) and Andrew Francis Bertinelli, Jr., a General Motors executive, and raised with her one older and two younger brothers. In her early teens, her father was transferred to a GM assembly plant in the Detroit, Michigan area and her family resided in Clarkston, Michigan, where she attended Clarkston Middle School. A short time later, her father again was transferred to another GM automotive plant in Van Nuys, California. At this time, Bertinelli became neighborhood friends of the daughter of a TV producer and soon enrolled in the Tami Lynn School of Artists to study acting. Tami Lynn launched Valerie's career in the CBS hit TV series, One Day at a Time (1975). Tami Lynn was Valerie's Personal Manager from 1971 through 1979.\n\nIn December 1975, the situation comedy One Day at a Time (1975), produced by Norman Lear, premiered on CBS with Bertinelli as \"Barbara Cooper\", one of two daughters of a recently divorced woman. The show was a long-time hit and ended production in 1984, without being canceled.\n\nBertinelli has starred in three feature films: R.O.B.O.D.O.G. (1979), Verlorene Helden (1986), and Der Berserker (1987). She was also the protagonist of the miniseries, I'll Take Manhattan (1987), based on a novel by Judith Krantz. She has appeared in made-for-TV movies almost annually since 1979. She was also the star of two other situation comedies, Sydney (1990) and Cafe Americain (1993), both of which were canceled after short runs. In 1981, she married rock guitarist Edward Van Halen. They had homes in the Hollywood Hills and Malibu and have a son, Wolfgang Van Halen. They separated in 2001, when Van Halen had tongue cancer. In 2005, Bertinelli filed for divorce for irreconcilable differences and, it was finalized two years later. Ms. Bertinelli is still chiefly remembered by her television fans for her work on One Day at a Time (1975).\n\nAn adored actress, Bertinelli's long and celebrated career has expanded to include equally beloved TV personality, spokesperson and best-selling author. She stars as \"Melanie Moretti\" on the Emmy® Award-winning series, Hot in Cleveland (2010), which in 2011 was nominated for a Screen Actors Guild Award® for Outstanding Performance by an Ensemble in a Comedy Series. The comedy revolves around three fabulous LA women of a certain age, and best friends (Bertinelli, Jane Leeves and Wendie Malick) whose lives are changed forever when their plane, bound for Paris, unexpectedly lands in Cleveland. Once safely on the ground, they soon rediscover themselves in this new \"promised land\" -- meeting their new landlord, played by Betty White, along the way.\n\nCute as a button and with a petite, porcelain prettiness and vulnerability that endeared her to the American public, Sally Struthers nabbed a series role in the early 1970s and became a solid part of TV history as a member of a dysfunctional family quartet in the milestone sitcom, Es bleibt in der Familie (1971).\n\nShe was born Sally Ann Struthers, the daughter of a surgeon, on July 28, 1948, in Portland, Oregon. Raised there, she pursued an acting career following high school. She eventually moved to Los Angeles and trained at the Pasadena Playhouse College of Theatre Arts, earning a scholarship as its \"most promising student.\" She performed briefly in regional stock plays until finding her break as both a commercial actress and dancer on TV.\n\nA recurring dancer/performer on such variety shows as The Smothers Brothers Summer Show (1970) and The Tim Conway Comedy Hour (1970), the pert-nosed, blue-eyed, curly blonde cutie showed starlet promise in films, offering ditsy support in the Jack Nicholson starrer, Five Easy Pieces - Ein Mann sucht sich selbst (1970), and the chase film, The Getaway - Ihre Chance ist gleich null (1972), top-lining Steve McQueen and Ali MacGraw.\n\nAnd, then came the iconic series Es bleibt in der Familie (1971). Also starring Carroll O'Connor and Jean Stapleton as conservative parents Archie and Edith, and Rob Reiner as liberal husband Mike, Struthers went on to win two supporting Emmy Awards and four Golden Globe nominations as kewpie-doll Gloria Bunker Strivic, Archie Bunker's \"little goil.\"\n\nSeen occasionally guesting elsewhere on such popular TV programs as \"Love, American Style,\" \"The Courtship of Eddie's Father,\" \"Ironside,\" \"Laugh-In,\" \"Sonny and Cher\" and as the voice of teenage Pebbles Flintstone on the spin-off cartoon series The Pebbles and Bamm-Bamm Show (1971), Sally, along with Rob, finally left the popular family show after seven seasons, both eager to grow away from their strong TV images. While Reiner stepped away from the camera and became a noted director, Sally continued to act. She made her Broadway debut in \"Wally's Cafe\" in 1981 and returned, four years later, with a gender-bending version of \"The Odd Couple\" as neat-freak \"Florence\" opposite Rita Moreno's slovenly \"Olive\". In addition, she found steady work in both topical and light-hearted 70's TV movies with Aloha Means Goodbye (1974), Hey, I'm Alive (1975), Der große Houdini (1976), My Husband Is Missing (1978), ...And Your Name Is Jonah (1979), A Gun in the House (1981), to name a few.\n\nWhen offers began to dry up for Sally, she returned to the TV series fold in the early 1980s spinning off her \"Gloria\" character, sans Rob Reiner, with the self-titled sitcom, Gloria (1982). Without Reiner (the plot had the couple split and her focusing on raising son Joey), the ensemble formula that worked so well for her earlier was missing here and the show died in its freshman year. To compensate, however, Sally's baby-doll voice worked extremely well for her in cartoons. She remained active off-camera, providing little girl voices for Saturday morning entertainment, notably her teenage \"Pebbles Flintstone\" character.\n\nIn addition to Yo Yogi! (1991) and Tiny Toon Abenteuer (1990), other TVanimated voice-over work included Käpt'n Balu & seine tollkühne Crew (1990) as \"Rebecca 'Becky' Cunningham\" and, notably, puppeteer Jim Henson's creative prehistoric sitcom, Die Dinos (1991), playing dino-daughter \"Charlene Sinclair.\"\n\nAs she grew older, Sally continued delighting fans with broader shtick in plus-sized parts. She showed that she had lost none of the fun for which she was known, by providing hearty comedy relief when she joined the prime-time series 9 to 5 (1982) and as a guest in \"Charles in Charge,\" \"Sister Kate\" and \"Murder, She Wrote.\"\n\nThe musical stage was another popular venue. Over the years, she has patented the by-the-book principal \"Miss Lynch\", with her many \"Grease\" tours, and as the scheming orphanage operator \"Miss Hannigan\" in a number of road productions of \"Annie.\" She went on to cop a 2002 Los Angeles \"Ovation\" award for her delightfully over-the-top \"Agnes Gooch\" in \"Mame\", starring Carol Lawrence and in 2012, she performed in both \"Always...Patsy Cline\" as Louise Segar, and \"9 to 5: The Musical\" as nosy Roz Klein. In 2014, Struthers toured in the 50th anniversary production in the title role of \"Hello, Dolly!\"\n\nInto the millennium, Sally has guested on such series as \"Sabrina, the Teenage Witch\" and \"The Division,\" had recurring roles on Still Standing (2002) and Gilmore Girls (2000), and was seen in featured or cameo roles in such independent films as the drama A Month of Sundays (2001), the mystery thriller Reeseville (2003), the Mario Van Peebles biopic How to Get the Man's Foot Outta Your Ass (2003), the comedy Monster Heroes (2010), and the musical comedies Waiting in the Wings: The Musical (2014), Hollywood Musical! (2015), Waiting in the Wings: Still Waiting (2018) and Christmas Harmony (2018).\n\nDivorced, Sally is the mother of one daughter who has made a career for herself as a clinical psychologist.\n\nFor years, Sally was a prime spokesperson for the Christian Children's Fund on TV, fervently (and often tearfully) appealing for viewer's monetary assistance in finding an end to starvation in under-developed countries.\n\nSpunky actress, singer and comedienne all rolled up into one, Puerto Rican-American Liz Torres was born on September 27, 1947, a native of the Bronx. She began her stand-up/singing career as a regular performing in various small NYC niteries. It wasn't until she received an invite to appear on The Tonight Show Starring Johnny Carson (1962) that her comic career started blooming on TV and in film.\n\nLiz has been a broadly familiar ethnic face on the sitcom circuit, having had regular or recurring parts in numerous series. In addition to regular roles on 70s TV variety shows for Melba Moore, Clifton Davis and Ben Vereen, she replaced the late Barbara Colby in the Mary Tyler Moore spinoff Phyllis (1975) starring Cloris Leachman following Colby's tragic murder. A year later she joined the Es bleibt in der Familie (1971) cast for a season. Liz co-starred in a number of short-lived series such as Checking In (1981), The New Odd Couple (1982) and City (1990) before hitting paydirt and scoring multiple Emmy and Golden Globe nominations for her prime role of Mahalia on Nachtschicht mit John (1993). She has continued to make the guest rounds on such popular series as Ally McBeal (1997), Die Nanny (1993), Zurück in die Vergangenheit (1989), Wunderbare jahre (1988) and L.A. Law: Staranwälte, Tricks, Prozesse (1986), often providing some necessary comedy relief amid the drama, and she is a veteran of many mini-movies, both comedic and dramatic.\n\nOn Broadway, Torres replaced Tony-winning Rita Moreno as men's bathhouse entertainer Googie Gomez in the wacky comedy \"The Ritz\" and portrayed the bizarre character of Bunny in \"House of Blue Leaves.\" The musical part of her has recorded for RCA and appeared in a number of stage roles that have ranged from Aldonza/Dulcinea in \"Man of La Mancha\" to lightweight roles in \"Bye Bye Birdie\" and \"See Saw.\"\n\nShe has provided amusing vignettes in such film comedies as Immer noch ein seltsames Paar (1998) starring the late Jack Lemmon and Walter Matthau, Sunset - Dämmerung in Hollywood (1988) with Bruce Willis and Permanent Midnight - Voll auf Droge (1998) showcasing Ben Stiller. She was nominated for her the\n\nAlthough comedy has been Liz's primary career outlet, her millennium film credits have leaned toward heavier material with featured parts in the romantic drama Gabriela (2001), the urban drama King Rikki (2002), the social drama Taylor (2005) and the dramedy West of Brooklyn (2008). Outside the recurring roles on the law series First Monday (2002) and the Latino family drama American Family (2002), TV has proven a different story where she is best remembered for her series role as \"Miss Patty\" in the long-running sitcom Gilmore Girls (2000), and made numerous amusing appearances on such regular comedies as \"The Fighting Fitzgeralds,\" \"The Brothers Garcia,\" \"Ugly Betty,\" \"Desperate Housewives,\" \"Devious Maids\" and the Cuban-American sitcom \"One Day at a Time.\"\n\nLong married to producer Peter Locke, the couple resides in Los Angeles.\n\nArmed with an acid dry wit and a full arsenal of sarcasm and sass, African-American character comedienne Marla Gibbs showed up on 1970s television with a bang in middle age (44). Landing the feisty maid role on the popular ground-breaking CBS sitcom Die Jeffersons (1975), eventually led to her very own sitcom 227 (1985) a decade later and international celebrity. A divorced mother with three children (Angela Elayne Gibbs, Dorian Gibbs, Joseph Gibbs) at the time of her initial success, it was a job transfer from Detroit to Los Angeles, while working as a United Airlines reservation clerk, that set up this more-than-welcome surprise and change of destiny.\n\nBorn in Chicago on June 14, 1931, Marla attended Peters Business School (1950-1952) following high school and toiled for a time as a receptionist and switchboard operator in the Detroit area. Eventually, she secured work with United Airlines. After moving to Southern California on a transfer, Marla gave acting a try and initially studied at the Mafundi Institute and Watts Writers Workshop, located in the Watts area of L.A.\n\nBitten hard by the acting bug, Marla went on to appear in a number of local productions, including \"Medea\", \"The Amen Corner\" and \"The Gingerbread Lady\". After only a couple of minor film roles, including the blaxploitation film, Freie Fahrt ins Jenseits (1974), she nabbed the role of Florence Johnston and television stardom.\n\nOn Die Jeffersons (1975), the role of Florence, the maid, was initially set up as a mere one-shot guest role but Marla showed the character's potential. And, so it came to be that Florence Johnston became THE scene-stealing foil to Sherman Hemsley's equally mouthy, money-minded George Jefferson. Until the sitcom became a certified hit, Marla cautiously kept her job with the Airlines. However, with wisecracks and Emmy Award nominations (totaling 5) a plenty, Marla never really had to look back. The role of Florence was a natural for a spin-off series and it happened with the sitcom, Checking In (1981), in which the character becomes a housekeeper for a very swanky hotel. However, the sitcom was harmed by a writer's strike before it could gain a core audience. Fortunately for Marla, she was ushered right back into the Jefferson household following its quick demise (four episodes). Two months after the last \"Jeffersons\" episode aired in July 1985, 227 (1985) was included in that year's fall schedule.\n\nDaughter Angela Elayne Gibbs produced an award-winning play by Christine Houston entitled \"227\", with Marla as the lead, at Marla's own local Crossroads Theatre, which the actress founded in 1981. The award-winning play was a solid hit and Marla wisely purchased the television rights. Once \"The Jeffersons\" was over, she pushed for \"227\" as a sitcom vehicle. Producer Norman Lear gave it the green light and Marla settled right back in for another popular series ride (for NBC), this time as resident gossip Mary Jenkins, whose demeanor was warmer and more approachable than the feisty Florence Johnson. This sitcom, which featured spitfire Jackée Harry as vampish neighbor Sandra Clark, ran for five years.\n\nAn eight-time NAACP Image Award winner, Marla has received several honors over the years, including Essence Woman of the Year. She has not carried a series since \"227\", but has been seen from time to time on other popular shows, including Emergency Room: Die Notaufnahme (1994), Cold Case - Kein Opfer ist je vergessen (2003), Chappelle's Show (2003), Für alle Fälle Amy (1999), Ein Hauch von Himmel (1994), King of Queens (1998) and Dawsons Creek (1998). She has also had recurring roles on daytime (Passions (1999)) as well as prime-time (Pryor's Place (1984), Allein unter Nachbarn (1998)) and gave a knowing portrayal as Natalie Cole's mother in the heart-warming television movie, Lily in Winter (1994).\n\nIn later years, Marla turned up again on the big screen with plucky roles in Up Against the Wall (1991), Meteor Man (1993), Get the Dog - Verrückt nach Liebe (1999), Foolish (1999), Border to Border (1998), The Brothers - Auf der Suche nach der Frau des Lebens (2001), and standout roles in The Visit (2000) and Stanley's Gig (2000).\n\nElsewhere, Marla's voice has been heard on the animated series 101 Dalmatiner (1997) and, in addition to acting, sang the theme song to the film Stanley's Gig (2000), \"In the Memory of You\", which will be included on a CD, entitled \"Scenes In Jazz\". Marla owned a jazz club for some time in South Central L.A. called \"Marla's Memory Lane, a jazz and supper club that ran from 1981 to 1999. She released her own CD of music, \"It's Never Too Late\", in May 2006, and co-wrote with Ray Colcord, the theme song to her starring series \"227\".\n\nInto the millennium, Marla suffered both personal and professional setbacks. Her older sister, Susie Garrett, who co-starred on the hit sitcom Punky Brewster (1984), died of cancer in 2002. A few years later, in 2006, Marla suffered a small aneurysm followed by a stroke. She recovered and made a gradual comeback as a guest on such TV shows as Lincoln Heights (2006), House of Payne (2006), Mr. Box Office (2012), Scandal (2012), Hot in Cleveland (2010), The Blexicans (2015), American Horror Story (2011), This is Us: Das ist Leben (2016), Black-ish (2014), Navy CIS (2003), Bless This Mess (2019) and the revamped One Day at a Time (2017). At one point, she played the recurring role of Grandma Eddy on the comedy series The First Family (2012) which starred her old \"227\" castmate Jackée Harry. On stage, Marla appeared in such comedies as \"Boeing, Boeing\" and was featured in such comedy films as C'mon Man (2012), Madea's Witness Protection (2012), Grantham & Rose (2014), Lemon (2017), Please Stand By (2017), Love Jacked (2018) and She Ball (2020).\n\nActress-comedienne Bea Arthur was born Bernice Frankel on May 13, 1922 in New York City to a Jewish family. She grew up in Maryland, where her parents ran a dress shop. At 12 years old, she was the tallest girl in her school at 5'9\".\n\nShe earned the title of \"Wittiest Girl\" in her school, and her dream was to be in show business, but she didn't think her family would support her. She then worked as a laboratory technician, and in the Marine Corps; she drove a truck, and worked as a typist. Her brief first marriage ended in divorce. Afterwards, she told her parents that she wanted to pursue a career in show business, and they supported her decision to join the New York's Dramatic Workshop for the New School for Social Research.\n\nArthur (her acting name based on a variation of her first husband's surname) played classical and dramatic roles, but it would be years before she found her niche in comedy. Her breakthrough came on stage while appearing in the musical play \"The Threepenny Opera,\" with Lotte Lenya. For one season in the 1950's, she was a regular on Sid Caesar's television show,Caesar's Hour (1954). In 1964, she became truly famous as Yente the Matchmaker, in the original Broadway production of \"Fiddler on the Roof\". Despite this being a small supporting role, Arthur stole the show night after night.\n\nIn 1966, she went to work on a new Broadway musical, \"Mame\", directed by her second husband, Gene Saks, winning a Tony Award for the featured role of Vera Charles. The show's star, Angela Lansbury, also won a Tony Award, and she and Bea became lifelong friends. In 1971, Arthur appeared on the hit sitcom Es bleibt in der Familie (1971) as Maude Findlay, Edith Bunker's cousin, who was forever driving Archie Bunker crazy with her liberal politics. The guest appearance led to Arthur's own series, Maude (1972). The show was a hit, running for six years, during which many controversial topics of the time, including abortion, were tackled, and Bea won her first Emmy Award. While doing Maude (1972), Arthur repeated the role of Vera Charles in the film version of Mame (1974), again directed by Gene Saks, but it was a dismal flop. She also appeared on The Star Wars Holiday Special (1978). While appearing in Maude (1972), she raised her two sons, whom she had adopted with husband Gene Saks. After the show ended, so did her marriage to Saks. She never remarried. She became a lifelong animal rights' activist.\n\nIn 1983, she started working on a new sitcom, Amanda's (1983), patterned after Britain's Das verrückte Hotel - Fawlty Towers (1975) but it was short-lived. In 1985, Golden Girls (1985) made its debut. Co-starring Betty White, Rue McClanahan and Estelle Getty, the show was about the lives of three middle-aged women, and one elderly mother, (played by Getty, who was actually younger than White and Arthur), living in Miami. It was an immediate hit, running for seven seasons. All of the cast members, including Arthur, won Emmy Awards during the show's run. She left when she thought each show was at its peak. The producers realized the shows wouldn't be the same without her. In 1992, Golden Girls (1985) was canceled. Arthur kept a low profile, appearing in only two movies: Mein Partner mit der heißen Braut (1995) and Enemies of Laughter (2000).\n\nIn 1999, Arthur made an appearance at The N.Y. Friars Club Roast of Jerry Stiller (1999). She did a one-woman stage show in 2001, for which she received a Tony Award nomination. In 2003, she reunited with Betty White and Rue McClanahan for Golden Girls (1985) reunion special on the Lifetime Channel. Noticeably absent was supporting actress Estelle Getty, who was ill. The three lead actresses made appearances together for the rest of the decade to promote DVD releases of Golden Girls (1985). They appeared together for the last time in 1998, at the TV Land Awards, receiving a standing ovation as they accepted the Pop Culture Award. She attended her induction into the Academy of Television Arts and Sciences Hall of Fame, with Angela Lansbury.\n\nOn April 25, 2009, at home with her family, Arthur died of cancer. She was 86. She was survived by her two sons, Matthew and Daniel, and her grandchildren, Kyra and Violet. In her will, she left $300,000 to New York's Ali Forney Center, an organization supporting homeless LGBT youths."
