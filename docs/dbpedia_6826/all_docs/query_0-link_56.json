Although subject to extreme privation, meager rations, forced marches, incessant interrogations, brutal beatings, sadistic torture, long periods of solitary confinement and threatened execution, Captain Warner, by his indomitable courage and resolute resistance completely defeated any attempt of the North Koreans and Chinese Communists to obtain security information they desired. His exemplary conduct and unequivocal conviction that the forces of freedom would ultimately prevail over an enemy ruthlessly avowed to destroy the independence of mankind, encouraged and inspired other prisoners to resist the insidious demands of their captors. By his outstanding leadership, heroic self-sacrifice and ceaseless opposition to the North Koreans and Chinese Communists, Captain Warner has reflected great credit upon himself and the United States Air Force.\n\nWarner, PVT Sherman D.

While awaiting for a replacement gun, Private Watkins and three comrades remained in position and defended the exposed gap in the line with rifle fire. Although subjected to a heavy concentration of hostile fire, he remained at his post and continued to engage the overwhelming enemy forces until another machine gun had been put into operation. His heroic stand enabled his unit to repel the enemy assault and reflects great credit upon himself and the military service. Entered the military service from Georgia.\n\nWatley, PFC James M.

On the night of this date he was a crew member of an antiaircraft firing vehicle, attached to an infantry battalion, which had been surrounded and was desperately defending its perimeter. The enemy captured a hill overlooking the battalion positions, and from this vantage point, delivered devastating mortar and small arms fire into the battalion area. During this action, orders were received to place fire on the enemy positions. Disregarding the intense enemy fire, and his own personal safety, he remained in the firing vehicle, which was in an exposed position, and delivered such concentrated and accurate fire that the enemy was completely silenced, and 30 enemy soldiers were killed. The hill was retaken a few minutes later by our infantry with practically no resistance. The courage displayed by Private Webb on this occasion reflects great credit upon himself and the military service. Entered the military service from Texas.\n\nWebber, SGT Leroy F.

There was a large volume of friendly traffic moving through a critical intersection that was subjected to intermittent enemy small arms and mortar fire. Captain Weible fearlessly manned this intersection in such a manner that all friendly traffic cleared Yongsan with the least possible delay and confusion. Later when he learned that there were several wounded men in an open field about one mile southwest of Yongsan, he made tour trips in his jeep along a road subjected to enemy small arms and mortar fire in order tn evacuate these wounded men to an aid station.

When Corporal Weidow, an ammunition bearer in a weapons squad, saw the gunner and assistant gunner wounded by the enemy fire, he immediately dashed forward to assume the gunner position. A few minutes later, Corporal Weidow also became wounded, but seeing the advancing elements of his platoon needed supporting fire, he picked up the machine gun and ammunition and carried it forward to give the attacking riflemen fire support.

When the enemy grenades were thrown into Private Weirs’ position, he un-hesitantly picked them up and threw them back at the enemy. After throwing his own grenades, he charged the hostile position, killing two and capturing four of the enemy.

Through his courage and determination in the face of overwhelming odds, he succeeded in assembling all elements on commanding ground without casualties. The heroism displayed by Lieutenant Welcher reflects great credit upon himself and the military service. Entered the military service from Iowa.\n\nWeldon, PFC Harold d.

His unit occupied defensive positions on a small hill which was dominated by strong enemy positions located on commanding terrain features overlooking friendly defenses. Hostile forces launched a strong, determined assault and, attacking from the rear, delivered extremely heavy small-arms and automatic-weapons fire. Despite wounds received during the action, Private Weldon remained with his radio and continued to carry out his duties under difficult circumstances. On one occasion, being unable to transmit a message by radio, he carried it through to his unit commander.

Advancing through heavy enemy fire, Corporal Wellington rushed forward and engaged the hostile soldiers in hand-to-hand combat. During this encounter, six of the enemy were killed and the remainder forced to withdraw.

On the night of 31 August 1950 he was a member of his company's rear command group. A strong enemy force came around the left flank of the company and attacked his group from the rear. A defense perimeter was immediately organized. Corporal White, with complete disregard for his personal safety, constantly exposed himself to the intense hostile fire raking the perimeter in order to return the enemy fire. On one occasion, he voluntarily left the safety of his covered position and dashed through the enemy fire to an abandoned jeep. Aided by two comrades, he returned to the perimeter with a .50 caliber machine gun and two automatic rifles, thereby greatly increasing the firepower of the small defensive force and covering all avenues of approach. Although the group was surrounded, he courageously held his ground until, early in the morning of 1 September 1950, orders were received to withdraw. His fearless determination throughout this firefight contributed greatly to the success of the command group in preventing the forward elements of his company from being attacked from the rear. The heroism displayed on this occasion by Corporal White reflects great credit upon himself and the military service.\n\nWhite, CPL Raymond L.

As night fell, it became difficult to see the enemy group which began to disperse. When suddenly fired upon and when an abandoned vehicle exploded behind the patrol, Private First Class Whitfield moved calmly among his men, placing them in more suitable positions in case of further attack. Then after a thorough but fruitless search of the area, he assisted in directing the safe return of the patrol to friendly lines.

With complete disregard for his own safety, he made sure that the equipment was completely destroyed. In the afternoon of that day, while he was riding in convoy through an enemy roadblock south of Kunu-ri, the convoy was halted by intense enemy mortar, machine gun, and small arms fire. Corporal Wiley left cover and faced enemy fire with some of his comrades to form a patrol to take a ridge line commanding the road, in order to provide left flank security for the passage of the convoy.

On the night of 31 August 1950 the enemy, attacking in overwhelming numbers, had penetrated our lines and were attempting to make a complete breakthrough in that area. During the enemy advance, a small group of men from a heavy weapons company were cut off and surrounded by the enemy. The group formed a perimeter defense and dug in. Private Wilkey was a member of this group. From 1 to 3 September 1950 the perimeter was under constant, heavy enemy artillery, mortar, and machine gun fire and was subjected to frenzied and frequent hostile assaults. Rations were low, and the only water available to the men was the early morning dew that gathered from the grass, rifle stocks and other equipment. In spite of these adversities Private Wilkey was constantly in the midst of every fire fight and aided in beating off the determined enemy attacks. Throughout this trying period, his unfailing determination and fortitude were a constant source of inspiration to his comrades and contributed greatly to the sturdy defense of the perimeter.

From 1 to 3 September 1950 the perimeter was under constant, heavy enemy artillery, mortar, and machine gun fire and was subjected to frenzied and frequent hostile assaults. Rations were low, and the only water available to the men was the early morning dew that gathered from the grass, rifle stocks and other equipment. In spite of these adversities Private Wiswell was constantly in the midst of every fire fight and aided in beating off the determined enemy attacks. Throughout this trying period, his unfailing determination and fortitude were a constant source of inspiration to his comrades and contributed greatly to the sturdy defense of the perimeter. The heroism and devotion to duty displayed by Private Wiswell reflect great credit upon himself and are in keeping with the high traditions of the military service.
