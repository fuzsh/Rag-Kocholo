        "text": "Phil Alexander, '67\n\n2023 Distinguished Alumni Honoree\n\nPhilip D. Alexander was born February 25, 1947 and grew up on a farm in Bartlesville. He fell in love with the idea of joining the military after hearing stories about being a tail gunner from his Sunday school teacher. That idea became more attainable when Phil began attending the Oklahoma Military Academy in 1962.\n\nDuring Phil’s time at OMA he was active on the Drill Team, Saber Society, Honor Court and Color Guard. Phil has many fond memories of OMA including Cadet Capers, shop class with Major Howard Shirk, modifying the old hearse with Bruce Dougherty for the cheerleaders to use, the camaraderie of the corps of cadets and all the valuable life training.\n\nAfter Phil completed his studies at OMA’s Junior College in 1967, he was commissioned into the US Army the following year. Phil spent 2 years serving in Korea on active duty as an engineer. He then served in the reserves for 15 years with the rank of Captain. Phil also attended Oklahoma State University during this time, where he received his bachelor’s and master’s degrees. Phil taught for three years at Kiamichi Vo-Tech and then spent 25 years as an instructor at Oklahoma State University – IT in Okmulgee teaching automotives. He has obtained certifications in a variety of automotive fields, including the prestigious title of Certified Master Diagnostician with Toyota and General Motors. Phil started his own business after retiring from teaching. All Electric LLC, Aviation Unlimited, and Sound Unlimited were all businesses he owned. In addition, Phil holds a commercial pilot’s license and is a certified flight instructor.\n\nPhil and his wife, Debbie, have been married for 51 years and have one daughter, Julia, a son-in-law, Shane, and two grandsons. Phil is very active in his church; he has taught Sunday School in the past and is currently serving on the board. Phil volunteers his time designing and building audio visual systems for churches and auditoriums.\n\nWhile recalling his early reluctance to get involved with the alumni association, Phil was overcome with emotion as he spoke about what this honor means to him. He added, “OMA played a significant role in who I am now. Although I don’t think about it every day, I live ‘Courage, Loyalty, and Honor’ daily.”\n\nDarrell Jenkins, '68\n\n2023 Distinguished Alumni Honoree\n\nDarrell Jenkins was born in Tulsa, Oklahoma on March 28, 1947. He began his time at the Oklahoma Military Academy in the fall of 1963 and, after spending five years at OMA, he graduated in 1968. Darrell then attended college at Northeastern State University for two years. Darrell served in the military as a Captain and was active in the Army Reserves for 12 years. He has been a real estate developer for 50 years. Darrell and his wife, P. Kae, have a son, Allen. They have also been blessed with a grandson, Paxton Jenkins, and a great-granddaughter, Parker Jenkins.\n\nDarrell has many fond memories of OMA that left a considerable impression on him. Some of the best ones involved his time on the OMA Drill Team and traveling to the events the team participated in together. Darrell was also involved in Bowling, the Saber Society, New Cadet Detail, Cadet Capers, was on the Vedette staff, and was in the top ten percent of his military class. Although Darrell stated his greatest challenge at OMA was adapting to the way of military life, he remembers the rabbit period as a good character-building experience. He developed lifelong friendships at OMA and learned important lessons during his time on “The Hill.” According to Darrell, one of the most valuable lessons he learned was the ability to interact with people of varied backgrounds and ideologies.\n\nDarrell has been active in his community, serving on the Board of Directors for the Tulsa Boys Home and helping to build a home for a school teacher through a program called Habitat for Humanity. He has been a member of the National Homebuilders Association since 1971 and is also involved locally with the Tulsa Homebuilders Association. Darrell was elected to the OMA Board of Directors for a three-year term in 2022.\n\nThe virtues established by the Oklahoma Military Academy of Courage, Loyalty and Honor have remained important to Darrell throughout his lifetime. He stated that being recognized by his peers for the Distinguished Alumni Award is very gratifying for him.\n\nDrew Shipley, '64 (Posthumously)\n\n2023 Distinguished Alumni Honoree\n\nDrew Shipley was born on March 28, 1946, and grew up in Miami, Oklahoma. His time on the Hill began in January 1962 and he soon became a member of the OMA Radio Club. Shipley graduated from OMA in the spring of 1964. He immediately joined the army and was in “B” Company, 1st Battalion (Mechanized), 50th Infantry.\n\nCorporal Shipley began his second Vietnam tour of duty on September 1, 1967. He was part of the 1st Calvary Division (Airmobile) in “Operation Pershing” on the coastal Bong Son Plains in Binh Dinh Province, Vietnam. Shipley led his squad in an ambush patrol on December 10, 1967. His company came under heavy fire from the village of Truong Lam and he was killed in action. Shipley was awarded the Silver Star for his heroic actions that day and was posthumously promoted to Sergeant. In addition to the Silver Star, his awards and decorations include the Purple Heart, National Defense Service Medal, Vietnam Service Medal, Vietnam Campaign Medal, and Combat Infantry Badge. Sergeant Shipley exemplified the OMA credo of Courage, Loyalty and Honor. He was laid to rest in the Grand Army of the Republic Cemetery in his hometown of Miami, Oklahoma.\n\nSergeant Shipley’s former Company Commander, Dick Guthrie, wrote, “He could show flashes of insubordination, but few rivaled him in the field-craft.” Guthrie reminisced about Corporal Shipley and two other squad leaders, both being Sergeants, preparing their men for the battle that led to Shipley’s death. He said of the other two squads, “Both of them were led by Sergeants, but neither order was as crisp or well thought-out as Shipley’s had been.” On May 2, 2013, the Company B Barracks of the 1st Battalion, 50th Infantry Regiment, Fort Benning, Georgia, was named Shipley Barracks in honor of Sergeant Drew Shipley. Dick Guthrie accepted the Dedication Certificate on behalf of Shipley and his family.\n\nJack Wilkinson, '67 (Posthumously)\n\n2023 Distinguished Alumni Honoree\n\nJack M. Wilkinson Jr. was born on November 7, 1947 in Tulsa, Oklahoma. All four years of high school, starting in 1962, as well as his first year of college, in 1967, were spent at the Oklahoma Military Academy. Jack attended the University of Oklahoma for two years after leaving OMA. He then served as a Weapons Platoon Leader in Vietnam.\n\nWith his father, Jack co-owned Monarch Asphalt Industries and had a successful career in the asphalt industry. Jack participated in the Chapel Foundation, Choir, Cadet Capers, the Honor Court, DeMolay, and the Saber Society during his time on “The Hill.” He was also the Guidon Editor, Chevron Society Vice President, the High School Drill Team Commander, and was part of the Honor Committee. Jack received a promotion to the position of Sergeant Major during his final year of high school at OMA.\n\nJack and his wife, June, made their home in Fayetteville, Arkansas. Together they had one son, Brian, a daughter, Elizabeth, and one grandson Jerod Wilkinson. Jack passed away on October 3, 2011 in Fayetteville and his wife followed him less than two years later in 2013.\n\nRichard Dixon, '68\n\n2022 Distinguished Alumni Honoree\n\nRichard Dixon graduated from OMA in 1968. While there, he received numerous awards for his athletic achievements, including Tulsa World Player of the Week, Tulsa World 1st Team All-District and All-State Running Back, OMA Best All-Around Athlete, and he even qualified for the state tournament in wrestling. He gained a valuable set of skills at OMA, which helped him go on to a successful collegiate and professional career.\n\n“There were a lot of things it prepared me for later on in life,” he says. After receiving a scholarship to play Division One football for the University of Tulsa, Dixon would need all the preparation he could get. He went through four different head coaches while at TU, which created an even greater challenge. “You had to go prove yourself every single time you had a different coach,” he says. And that’s exactly what he did. Dixon wound up starting as a defensive end and played with future NFL Hall of Famers like Steve Largent and Drew Pearson.\n\nIn 1972, Dixon graduated TU with a BSBA in Business Marketing. From 1976 -1981, he served as Director of Alumni Relations at TU and the Tulsa Golden Hurricane Club, and then as Director of Development. Dixon found himself looking for another challenge, though. He served under great leaders during his time at OMA, and it was now his turn to take the role. “I always had a desire to have my own business,” he says. Dixon started working at Morgan Pump, a company that sold pumping units for oil wells. After watching some of the manufacturer representatives, he thought, “Hey, this is something I could do!”\n\nDixon and one of his business associates decided to open OPECo, which was incorporated in 1984. Despite early challenges, such as the oil crash of 1986, Dixon persevered and grew the company into a multi-million-dollar business with eight strategically located warehouses in five states. He also served several years as Chairman of the Associates Committee on the Oklahoma Gas Association board of directors.\n\nDixon is retired now, although he and his partner remain 50% co-owners of the company. “I’m fully, semi-retired,” he says with a laugh.\n\nHe has plenty keeping him busy, though. For over fifteen years, Dixon and his wife mentored youth at Eugene Field Elementary and Webster Middle School. He also served as horse foreman at Tulsa Hills Youth Ranch, an organization that offers foster youth the opportunity to interact with horses and engage in other outdoor activities while learning valuable life lessons. He contributes to various missionary efforts, and he is especially interested in clean water projects.\n\nFor the past few years, Dixon has been an active member of the OMA Alumni Association. After attending the OMA 50 Year Anniversary in 2018, he decided to get more involved. “That’s when I got re-energized,” he says. Dixon now meets with several OMA Alumni members on a regular basis, and he is an important contributor through donations. “It’s kind of a unique deal,” he recalls, “getting in touch with those guys after 50 years.”\n\nDixon can be found at the annual reunion golf tournaments held by the OMA Alumni Association. He also enjoys spending time at his 32-acre ranch south of Tulsa; he has three horses, three miniature donkeys, three dogs, and a cat.\n\nJ. Jay Hines, '58\n\n2022 Distinguished Alumni Honoree\n\nFor J. Jay Hines, finishing his education at the Oklahoma Military Academy was an easy decision to make. “Been in a military family, around military my whole life,” he says. “My dad went in the Army in WWII when I was about 3 years old, and stayed in.”\n\nIn fact, his enthusiasm for service was so great that he joined the military even before attending OMA, having enlisted in the National Guard at age 15. “That’s right,” he laughs, “you didn’t have to have a birth certificate back then!” Hines later transferred to the Army Reserve Unit on “The Hill” and was the Company Guidon.\n\nHines participated in many organizations while at the Oklahoma Military Academy. He was a talented tenor sax player and enjoyed playing in the various bands. In 1957, the Marching Band was selected as the official band when Oklahoma celebrated its semi-centennial, giving a concert on the south steps of the Capitol to open the 1957 Legislature. In 1959, thanks to a letter Hines wrote, the Drill Team and Marching Band were invited to participate in the Mardi Gras celebration in New Orleans. He was also in the Concert Band, Rock and Roll Band, and the Dance Band — the “Kaydets”— which played countless events on and off-campus.\n\nWhile in the Glee Club, Hines recalls, he met their accompanist, a local girl who would become his girlfriend. “I was the only rabbit with a date every Tuesday and Thursday night during CQ!”\n\nBy the time he graduated in 1958, Hines had received several awards for his accomplishments. He won the Athletic Ribbon for his involvement on the football and wrestling team, the Merit Ribbon, Band Award, Military Proficiency Ribbon, Outstanding Company, and Expert Marksman Badge and in 1969, won the rifle match between the cadets, instructors and alumni. Hines reached the rank of Corporal on the N.C.D., and his squad won Best Drill Squad of 1958.\n\nAfter graduating OMA, Hines served in the Air Force as a Crew Chief on the C-124— the largest cargo plane at the time. Hines then attended Southwest Tech and surveyed and drafted for the Oklahoma City Board of Education and the State of Oklahoma Highway Department as well as flying for the highway department as an Aerial Observer and Planning Technician. The Boy Scouts of America offered him the position of District Scout Executive for Western Oklahoma, and later the Director of Community Relations in Amarillo, Texas due to his experiences as a longtime volunteer leader with the BSA. Following a transfer to Amarillo, Texas, J. Jay Hines finally found the profession he would stay in for the next fifty years.\n\nAfter attaining a successful professional and military career, and still in his early thirties, Hines thought he would try the transportation industry. “I wanted to see more of this beautiful country; I had a wanderlust, so I decided to hang up my suit, put on some boots and gloves and hit the road! I have been an Owner Operator, Safety Director and Union Company Driver” The job has stuck, and over the course of his trucking career, Hines has travelled to all fifty states, several Canadian Provinces, and several Mexican states. He drives a truck to this day.\n\nHines has also maintained a commitment to civic duty, a commitment that extends all the way back to his childhood. He quickly became an Eagle Scout while in the Boy Scouts of America and was a Page in the 1955 State Legislator for Senator Walt Allen. The two years he spent at OMA instilled an even stronger sense of duty in him, and he has exemplified the values of courage, loyalty, and honor throughout his life.\n\nHe continues to give back to the community, he has been a member of Toastmasters International, the Lion’s Club, and the Rotary Club. J. Jay is a Master Mason and member of the York Rite, Scottish Rite and Shrine. He also contributes to St. Jude’s and Shriner’s Hospital, which provides free healthcare services to children with various ailments. “We have twenty-two hospitals,” he says, “but it doesn’t cost a dime, regardless of how much the people make… there’s never any charge; for braces, for surgeries, for anything, not even transportation to the hospitals.”\n\nHines generously contributes to both OMA projects and the RSU Endowment Fund. In honor of his contribution for the OMA Museum Renovation, he and his late wife will be recognized and honored in the conference center. He also established the J. Jay and Marlene Hines scholarship for RSU GOLD students. J. Jay Hines recently lost his wife and includes her name on everything. “Everything I do is with her by my side,” he says. “My job allows me to be home every day, so I visit her and place a fresh rose on her grave each day, ‘COME RAIN OR SHINE’ and I carry her photograph in my pocket every day.”\n\nHines sums up his fondness for the OMA Alumni Association simply: “I just enjoy seeing some of the guys I used to go to school with or have known a long time, being back on our beautiful campus and just reminiscing.”\n\nJim Tanner, '67\n\n2022 Distinguished Alumni Honoree\n\nNestled in one of Claremore’s historic neighborhoods sits a modest house where Jim Tanner has operated his law firm for over forty years. Once inside, surrounded by the ranchstyle furniture and old maps and photographs of Claremore, one may start to see the significance of Tanner’s practice and his involvement in the Claremore community. And if they are lucky, they’ll get to meet Tanner’s furry business partner, Fluffy, the affable stray cat Tanner took in. It is no surprise that one of Claremore’s most influential citizens spent his formative years at the Oklahoma Military Academy.\n\n“It’s immeasurable the things you learn to do at OMA that you don’t even realize you know how to do,” he says. As it would turn out, Tanner knew how to do a lot.\n\nIn 1963, he enrolled at OMA high school as a day student. Once there, he took advantage of the school’s stellar music program by playing the trombone, baritone, and guitar in the various bands. He traveled with the Marching Band to countless places across the country, and he especially enjoyed the Dance Band. “It was really a lot of fun,” he says.\n\nTanner received the rank of Lieutenant Colonel, and because of his discipline and many talents, he became the Commander of the Day Students. Among his many awards, Tanner received an honorary saber for his leadership abilities.\n\nAfter graduating from OMA Junior College in 1967, Tanner wanted to enlist in active military service, but he was medically disqualified. Instead, he attended OU, where he received a law degree. “The other thing about going to law school,” he says, “that was probably as important as anything to me — I wanted to move back to Claremore.”\n\nTanner’s family has lived in Claremore since the early 1900s. “I can go out to the cemetery; there’s four generations of Tanners buried there.”\n\nHe practiced at a small firm near the Rogers County Courthouse for several years, then, in 1981, he wanted to try starting his own practice. He also wanted to take care of his great aunt’s house after she passed away. “Moving out here was a leap of faith,” he says.\n\nIt paid off. Tanner practiced diverse areas of law, grew his reputation, and eventually narrowed his specialty to real estate and probate. He is a highly respected attorney, and he has even served on the Claremore City Council. And the house, the one his great aunt’s husband spent so much time working on, remains in its original condition.\n\nTanner’s true success, however, is in the enormous contributions he has made to the community. “My grandmother, who was a schoolteacher, she would drill into your head ‘when you die you need to leave the world a little better than you found it.’” And he has worked diligently to do just that.\n\nIn 1991, Tanner started an organization called Safenet Services, Inc, which serves victims of domestic violence, sexual assault, and stalking. “We started out with nothing,” he says. Tanner used his business and legal tact to secure a grant and raise funds for the organization, which resulted in the construction of a multi-milliondollar facility called the Donald W. Reynolds Family Safety Center. Safenet Services can now house far more people and provide even more services.\n\nTanner is also heavily involved with Grand Lake Mental Health, where he has been a board member for over twenty years and has even served as board president. Grand Lake Mental Health provides a variety of mental health services to the community, including counseling, medication management, crisis centers, and support groups — all at no cost to those with low income. During Tanner’s time with Grand Lake, it has seen massive growth, with facilities appearing throughout Northeast Oklahoma. “If you don’t take care of your mentally ill,” he says, “you’re not going to have a country, you’re not going to have a society if you can’t tend to those people that are in need and can’t help themselves.”\n\nTanner has also generously supported the OMA Alumni Association and helped with the upcoming renovation of the OMA museum. Over the past decades, he has attended many reunions. Tanner has fond memories of OMA, like playing bridge in Thunderbird Hall, as well as participating in the hilarious ‘Gridiron’ performances. Many of his lifelong friends were made at OMA.\n\nHe has two daughters and three grandchildren. Tanner enjoys spending time at home with his wife, Cindy, working on old cars, and he continues to play his trombone. As a member and supporter of the Claremore Civic Band, Tanner contributes to the community while doing something he loves. The band meets on Tuesday nights and plays concerts in Claremore throughout the summer. He was also the leader of a 12-piece dance band called J.T. and the Big Band for over 15 years.\n\nTanner offers a straightforward reason he is so committed to civic engagement and philanthropy. “Helping other people is important,” he says. “What else are we here for?”\n\nJohn Helbing, '67\n\n2021 Distinguished Alumni Honoree\n\nHelbing attend the Oklahoma Military Academy from 1966-1967. He participated in drill team, color guard, wrestling and was the first sergeant of A company.\n\n“My fondest memories of OMA were spending weekends with a different cadet at his home, meeting his parents and relatives and enjoying home cooked meals,” Helbing said. “Instructor Sergeant Golden believed in me and helped me when I needed it the most. I’m forever grateful for the care and the commitment he made to ensure we had successful futures as men,” Helbing said.\n\nAfter completing his freshman year at OMA, Helbing transferred to the University of Wisconsin. The 1968 draft interrupted his studies. He served in the Army for three years and then returned to the University of Wisconsin to graduate with honors in 1975 with a bachelor’s degree in occupational safety and health.\n\nDuring his three years of military service, Helbing served with the special forces in the 173rd ABN and the 82nd Airborne achieving the rank of Specialist 5th Class. He was a platoon combat medic and then promoted to a company senior medic.\n\nFor his service he received the Combat Medical badge, the Bronze Star, Vietnam Service Medal with four Bronze Stars, the Republic of Vietnam Gallantry Cross with Palm Unit Citation, the Republic of Vietnam Campaign Medial with Device, the Parachute Badge, the Good Conduct Medal and the Expert Marksman Rifle.\n\nHelbing was honorably discharged from the Army in 1971 and joined the Wisconsin National Guard. He was promoted to Specialist 6th Class upon entry and promoted to Sergeant 1st Class, Medical Platoon Sergeant.\n\nHe held various safety management positions throughout his career ranging from plant safety manager to corporate safety director for Fortune 500 Corporations such as Sara lee, Chiquita, HJ Heinz and Bunge North America.\n\nSince his retirement, his focus is on volunteer work. Wings of Hope, a non-profit that provides free air medical transport to children and adults, is a way Helbing can nurture his love of flying and helping people along the way.\n\nIn his free time, Helbing enjoys golfing, photography, hunting and fishing, scuba diving, riding his pedal bike and of course, flying.\n\nCaptain Vincent P. Mocini, ‘69\n\n2021 Distinguished Alumni Honoree\n\nCaptain Vincent P. Mocini, U.S. Navy (ret) served as the U.S. Naval War College’s first Dean, International Programs and Maritime Security Cooperation from 2003 - 2012. During that time he grew the number of foreign officers attending the Naval War College and greatly enhanced the college’s efforts to engage with foreign alumni in the years following their graduation. Under his leadership, the College initiated a series of alumni symposiums in which the leadership of the War College traveled to locations around the world to connect foreign alumni with U.S. senior military leadership, to provide strategic and operational updates from the faculty, and to allow alumni to renew mutual friendships, so important to preventing conflict. Under his leadership, the war college conducted eight symposiums in every major geographic region of the world.\n\nPrior to that civilian government service, Captain Mocini served 30 years in the United States Navy. He served as the 24th Director of the Naval Command College (NCC) from 2001-2003. The NCC is the premier professional military education program offered to allied and friendly foreign naval officers. Prior to that, he was a member of the Naval War College faculty. From 1996 - 2000 he served in the U.S. Embassy, Rome as the Defense and Naval Attache, during which time he facilitated U.S. cooperation during the Italian-led humanitarian mission in Albania and NATO operations in Kosovo. In addition, earlier in his career, he served in joint and Navy staff assignments.\n\nCommissioned from the U.S. Naval Academy in 1973, Captain Mocini spent much of his career on sea duty. He served as Anti-Submarine Warfare Officer in USS Richard L. Page (FFG 5). During his tour, the ship won multiple service awards, including the “Battle E.” From 1980-1983, he served two tours as Engineering Officer in USS Fanning (FF 1076) and USS Halsey (CG 23). He was Flag Secretary for Commander, Amphibious Force SEVENTH Fleet in the Pacific.\n\nIn 1985, he took command of the patrol hydrofoil missile ship, USS Taurus (PHM 3). This advanced technology ship sailed in UNITAS with our South American allies. The ship also received several commendations for performance in counter-narcotics operations, including the seizure of a ship carrying 24 tons of marijuana in May 1986. After war college study and staff duty, Captain Mocini assumed command of USS Clifton Sprague (FFG 16). During his command tour again on counter-narcotics operations, the ship intercepted and seized a high-speed drug boat carrying more than 1000 kilograms of pure cocaine. The ship also participated in the first combined exercises with ships from the Russian Navy in Atlantic waters off the coast of the United States.\n\nCaptain Mocini was born in Chicago and raised in Saugatuck, Michigan.

Wooster, ‘62\n\n2021 Distinguished Alumni Honoree\n\nDarrell Wooster ’62 began his journey to OMA by following in the footsteps of his father and brother who attended OMA in the 30’s and 50’s respectively. His arrival on the “Hill”, as a rabbit, in 1961, began a lifelong love of everything OMA. It’s values, discipline, and it’s people.\n\nWooster states, “First and foremost, the friendships forged at OMA have been priceless. Mr. Bushong was a math professor who caught me walking across the drill field and whistled from the dining hall and said “Why aren’t you in here taking the ACT test?” I explained to him that I had to get ready for a trip to New Orleans Mardi Gras since I was on the Drill Team. Well he explained to me that if I didn’t take the test there wouldn’t be any trip to Mardi Gras. That brought everything into perspective.”\n\nThe friendships gained at OMA include David Ward, Randy Haroldson, Randy Vierling and many, many others. Wooster and Randy Vierling have followed each other’s lives since OMA and live only 3 miles apart.\n\nWooster would like to express his thanks to Dr. Larry Rice and Dr. Danette Boyle, two selfless people who work tirelessly for RSU and OMA Alumni Association. He would also like to thank the OMA Board of Directors members and selection committee and all those who have poured their lives into helping him and other students past and present here on the “Hill”. He states “Thank you and God Bless”.\n\nMr. Dave Blankenship, ‘52\n\n2019 Distinguished Alumni Honoree\n\nDave Blankenship graduated from Webster High School in Tulsa and attended junior college at the Oklahoma Military Academy in 1952. He lettered in football, basketball and baseball and also served on the Drill Team. Making lifelong friendships remains one of his fondest memories while at OMA.\n\nHe attended the University of Tulsa and joined the Air Force ROTC graduating in 1955. He received his wings at Vance Air Force Base in Enid, Oklahoma and was sworn into duty as a Second Lieutenant. He served three years on active duty, and as a Captain he finished his commitment to the Air Force by serving in an Air Force Reserve Unit as a pilot at Davis Field in Muskogee, Oklahoma.\n\nDuring the Cuban crisis, he was recalled to active duty until the crisis ended. In 1962, Blankenship began working with an aerospace industry (North American Aviation) when the company was moving to Tulsa. He was tapped to set up the office and hire personnel. He continued in executive positions as the company transitioned to Rockwell International and ultimately Boeing. He provided leadership in a variety of areas from hiring to training to public and government relations in the US and overseas.\n\nIn retirement, he continues his past connections to Spartan College of Aeronautics and Technology, where he currently serves as consultant to the CEO. He also serves on the board of Central Bank of Oklahoma.\n\nBlankenship joined the Air Force Association and attended his first annual convention in 1967. The Air Force Association is a national organization promoting the U.S. Air Force and honoring Airman and Air Force heritage. He never missed the spring or fall meetings until 2017. He was elected to the board, elected President from 1982-83, and served as Chairman of the Board in 1984.

So when he enrolled as a Freshman in 1964, he was thrilled to win starting spots on the wrestling and baseball team and join the award winning marching band.\n\nAdmittedly, Good was much more interested in his trumpet, drum sticks and sports than the rifle range, which his top rank of Sergeant First Class reflects - but he embraced OMA completely and marched proudly as a Cadet.\n\nFavorite memories at OMA were the two trips to the Mardi Gras in New Orleans where the OMA Marching Band got 3rd place, and performing at the Opening of the Hemisfair in San Antonio, along with the many wrestling and baseball trips. Mostly he remembers the fellowship, of not only classmates, but the instructors, coaches and administrators.\n\nAfter graduating from OMA in the spring of 1968, Good returned to Oklahoma City and in the fall enrolled in Central State College, now UCO in Edmond. Majoring in Business with a minor in Music, Good soon started an entertainment agency while attending college and the same year began a professional music career as a bandleader and singer.\n\nBooking shows and concerts for corporate and private events, Good booked and produced shows with artists such as Natalie Cole, Frankie Valli and the Four Seasons, Toby Keith, Lee Greenwood, Herman’s Hermits, The Gatlin Brothers, The Doobie Brothers, Three Dog Night, Paul Williams, K.C. & The Sunshine Band, The Temptations, Four Tops, Vince Gill, Sheryl Crow, Don Henley and a host of others.\n\nIn the mid 80s, Good added a speakers bureau to his company renaming it Gary Good Entertainment & Speakers Bureau, and began booking lectures for notables such as Bart Starr, Art Linkletter, Steve Allen, Joan Rivers, Debbie Reynolds, Robert Goulet, Barry Switzer, Olympia Dukakis, as well as many notable authors and business leaders. Most recently he secured an appearance in Dallas for Academy Award-winning actress, Diane Keaton.\n\nAfter being in business in Oklahoma City for over 35 years, in 2008 Good fell in love with Oklahoma’s original state capital, Guthrie, and has since moved his entire operation there. Always enjoying people and activity, Good began adding new ventures, which includes an eclectic art gallery called Gallery Grazioso, Suite Bettie Jean Bed & Breakfast (named after his Mom), Magnolia Manor Boutique Hotel and Magnolia Moon – a wedding and music event venue (as well as his home).\n\nCommunity involvement has always been important to Good. He served on the boards of The Oklahoma Chapter of the Multiple Sclerosis Society, The Cystic Fibrosis Foundation and was the longest serving Commissioner on The Oklahoma City Arts Commission serving for 34 years. He’s most active today in a project he began when his father passed away in 2003. He named it “The Al Good Instruments for Kids Project” and it’s designed to collect donated instruments - clarinets, trumpets, trombones, guitars, pianos etc. and place them in homes with kids that cannot afford to buy instruments. So far they have placed dozens of these instruments and over 20 pianos.\n\nGood’s wife Cristina has her PhD from OSU and is currently an adjunct professor there. She has two children who are also attending OSU. His brother, Ron, is editor and long-time sports writer for Amateur Wrestling News Magazine and was recently inducted into The National Wrestling Hall of Fame. Sister, Pattie, an entrepreneur lives in Phoenix. Good has two grown daughters; Margo, who lives in Wagoner and works in Pryor, and Andrea, who is living in Edmond, Oklahoma as well as two grandkids, Cass and Haleigh and four great grandkids, all living in Oklahoma within driving distance.\n\nMr. Tom Hargis, ‘67\n\n2019 Distinguished Alumni Honoree\n\nTom Hargis from Huntsville, Arkansas, graduated from OMA high school in 1965 and OMA Junior College in 1967. During the summer after his high school graduation, his father Earl Hargis, who also attended OMA, passed away.\n\nHargis was part of the Outstanding Company, Best Drilled Company, Best Drilled Platoon, Chevron Society, Order of the DeMolay, and Saber Society. He earned the Dean’s Honor Roll, Military Proficiency Ribbon, Merit Ribbon, Academic Achievement Wreath, Outstanding Cadet Identification Disc, an Athletic Ribbon in Baseball, and the 1964-1965 High School Business Award.\n\nAfter his time at OMA, Hargis attended the University of Arkansas and graduated in 1970 from Ouachita Baptist University with a bachelor’s degree in business administration.\n\nHargis, a Distinguished Military Graduate in ROTC, was commissioned as a 2nd Lieutenant in the U.S. Army Finance Corps.\n\nHargis retired in 1995 as a Lieutenant Colonel with more than 24 years of active duty service with assignments in Indiana, Pennsylvania, Texas, Kentucky, Virginia, Korea, Japan, and Turkey. Hargis served in positions including Finance and Accounting Officer at installation and Major Command level, installation Comptroller and Budget Officer, Budget Officer at HQs Department of the Army in the Pentagon, and as Executive Officer to the Comptroller of the Army.\n\nIn addition to the Finance Officer Basic and Advance Courses, while on active duty, Hargis also completed the Command and General Staff College, Defense Resource Management Course, and obtained his MBA at Marymount College in Arlington, Virginia.

His goal in attending OMA was to complete the accelerated two-year ROTC Program to obtain an Officer’s Commission. During his time at OMA, he reached the rank of Captain. Hancock was a member of the Chevron Society and the Officers Club, and he received the Distinguished Military Graduate ribbon.\n\nAfter his time at OMA, Hancock attended Oklahoma State University, graduating in 1973 with a Bachelor of Science Degree. Hancock entered active duty in September 1973 and was assigned to Ordnance Corps, stationed at Aberdeen Proving Grounds in Maryland. He remained on reserve duty until 1981.\n\nHancock was hired as the Property and Facilities Manager for Bank of Oklahoma Corporation in 1978 where he was responsible for management, maintenance, leasing, and construction of all bank-owned facilities. He remained with BOK for 14 years, leaving in 1992 to start his own construction and developing business. Beginning in 1992, Hancock and his wife developed a successful full-service residential construction company building high end (more than $1 million) homes from in-house architecture and design through completion. They later branched out into commercial development and senior living facilities.\n\nHancock has been married to Laurie for 25 years. While he has no children of his own, Laurie has three children and eight grandchildren.\n\nHancock came to OMA with the goal of obtaining a U.S. Army Commission, but failed to realize how much more he would gain from his time there. The lessons learned and the sense of responsibility instilled as Cadets formed the foundation for him to gain the success that he has had in life. Standing in formation directly below the flag as it was lowered for the last time in 1971 was a deeply emotional time for him, knowing that he had been a part of such an important institution to so many people.\n\nBill Hayes, ‘59\n\n2018 Distinguished Alumni Honoree\n\nBill Hayes graduated from OMA High School in 1959. Hayes served as President of the Senior Class, earned President’s Honor Roll, Best Drilled Cadet, Outstanding Cadet ID Disk, and was editor of the “Guidon.” He was also a member of the Chevron Society, “O” Club, Cadet Capers, OMA Band, and the Honor Society while lettering in basketball and rifle team.

This was the dawn of the “via satellite” era. He was the Test Director for S/C in the constellation that established the first world wide communications capability.\n\nHayes served as mission director for the first domestic communications systems satellites for the United States, Canada, Japan, Indonesia, and India and with S/C for special applications such as aircraft-ground communications, satellite direct TV/Radio, and weather cloud cover pics/data.\n\nHayes managed the selection, procurement, and integration of launch vehicles for SS/L S/C from the world’s inventory and directed the planning and execution of launch campaigns at launch sites in the US, Russia, Ukraine, French Guinea, China, and Japan.\n\nHayes has been responsible for all aspects of satellite manufacturing including systems engineering, integration, test, launch, mission control centers, and flight operations including the design, manufacture, and operation of support equipment for these disciplines.

He contributes to national veteran’s affairs (member of American Legion) and to fellow vets at the local veterans hospital.\n\nHayes believes his abilities to recognize other people’s talents/limitations, assign them appropriately, and to motivate/execute teamwork were derived through the leadership skills he attained from his OMA experience.\n\nSteve Smith, ‘65\n\n2018 Distinguished Alumni Honoree\n\nSteve Smith came to OMA by default. His father worked for Creole Petroleum Corporation (a wholly owned subsidiary of Standard Oil of New Jersey) in Venezuela. He attended the company-owned school for dependents through the eighth grade. There were no English speaking high schools where they lived, so it became necessary for him to attend a boarding school in the U.S. OMA was the obvious choice since the family was from Oklahoma.\n\nWhile at OMA, Smith served as treasurer of his freshman class, was recognized on the Dean’s Honor Roll all but two semesters, and was on the Chapel Foundation.

While there, he studied Mechanical Engineering and enrolled in the OU Army ROTC program. He found their ROTC to be relatively easy after four years of OMA, and as he was enrolling in the ROTC, he was asked “what would you like to be.” Smith replied First Sergeant would be OK and they let him have it. He then formed the company up and marched them to the parade field.\n\nSmith spent the majority of his working career in the electrical utility industry. He retired from Oklahoma Municipal Power Authority, where he spent 16 years as Chief Scheduler. His duties there included buying and selling energy and capacity for the member cities that make up OMPA. He then went to work for the American Electric Power company in Tulsa as an Electrical System Operator. After the northeast blackout of 2003, the North American Electric Reliability Corporation required all System Operators that operated the bulk electrical grid to be certified by the NERC. Smith held the highest certification for system operators (Reliability) for 16 years to insure the company was never in a position to lose control and encounter cascading outages, even at the expense of their own customers.\n\nDuring Oklahoma’s crippling 2007 ice storm, the extensive training paid off and the majority of its customers were back online in less than five days.\n\nDuring the summer months while attending OMA, Smith would fly back to Venezuela to be with his family. During this time, he served as a youth counselor at their nondenominational church summer camp, Campammento Maranatha.

Dolman, Jr. arrived on the Hill in the late summer of 1964 to begin school as a college freshman with the Class of 1965 and a member of the Cadet Corps. He attended OMA for two years, graduating in 1966. He came to the Hill after completing his initial six months of active duty with the U.S. Marine Corps and he joined his younger brother Paul W. Dolman, who was beginning his second year in high school at OMA.\n\nAfter a Rabbit period of eleven days, Dolman was promoted to corporal in A Company.

An opportunity came knocking in 1988 to join the development team that was building the first major continuing care retirement community in Jacksonville, Cypress Village. “That opportunity opened the door to what became a 25-year career in senior living,” Dolman said. “It was an immensely satisfying period in my life during which I was giving more than getting and serving more than being served.”\n\n“I came to OMA by a circuitous route having done my active duty but wanted to get back into college. When Paul and I could attend OMA together, that really made the Hill, the Corps and the friendships so much more meaningful,” he said.\n\nDolman also had an uncle, Joseph G. Perry, who attended OMA in 1931 and 1932, receiving an appointment to the U.S. Military Academy at West Point.\n\nDolman now resides in Jacksonville with his wife Marietta.

Today, Troop 26 has a yearly membership of nearly 200 boys each year and an adult staff of 50 trained leaders.\n\nThe troop has become the largest and one of the most successful troops in state history, generating more than 700 Eagle Scouts. Bill patterned many of the things he established in his Scout troop after things he had learned at OMA. He built a youth leadership program derived from his experiences in the Saber Society and Chevron Society. Discipline problems in the troop are handled by the boys themselves as elected members of the Troop 26 Honor Court. At OMA he learned firsthand that pride, uniforming and tradition are key ingredients to success, and he has modeled those traits to thousands of Tulsa scouts.\n\nBill planned encounters for his scouts with three American presidents (Gerald Ford, Ronald Reagan and George Bush Sr.) President Ford actually came to a troop meeting to present Eagle Scout Awards to 13 troop members. Bill authored and published two books, each a compilation of letters to scouts from some of America’s heroes from all walks of life, including Medal of Honor recipients, presidents, senators, congressmen, astronauts, admirals and generals, professional athletes and entertainment celebrities. “In The Words Of...” and “From The Hearts Of Heroes” each containing letters addressed to the scouts. They included letters from Jimmy Doolittle, Mamie Eisenhower, Bob Hope, Billy Graham, Jimmy Stewart, Gregory Peck, and the witch from the Wizard of Oz, Margaret Hamilton. A third book, “Voices From the Mountain” is currently in progress and will include a letter from OMA graduate General Edwin Ramsey.\n\nBill has been recognized locally, regionally and nationally with numerous awards, such as the Silver Beaver, the Silver Antelope and the Outstanding Scoutmaster Award from the National Eagle Scout Association. He was included in a National Task Force of Scoutmasters to review the draft of the 10th edition of the Boy Scout Handbook. Bill organized and sponsored an annual Oklahoma Special Camporee for 35 years, providing a special camping opportunity for mentally and physically challenged individuals, an event that was honored by the Joseph P. Kennedy, Jr. Foundation. Bill’s troop was recognized as the Special Olympic National Organization of the Year in 1980, alongside the Pittsburgh Steelers and the Kansas City Royals.\n\nBill has led his troop to summer camping adventures in Colorado, New Mexico, South Dakota, Arkansas, Texas, Kansas, Alaska and Hawaii, has attended 10 BSA National Jamborees, 10 High Adventure expeditions to Philmont Scout Ranch, a canoe expedition at Sommers Wilderness Canoe Base in Canada, and monthly campouts every month for 46 years. Someone added this up to be a total of four years of sleeping in a tent.\n\nBill’s Eagle Scouts are now taking their places in the business and professional communities all across the country that include doctors, lawyers, coaches, teachers, business leaders, law enforcement and the military. One of Bill’s Eagle Scouts was recently promoted to Brigadier General in the USAF.
