        "text": "U.S. Rep. Cory Mills is denying accusations of misrepresenting his four-year military career, sharing documents he says prove his record of heroic Army service.\n\nMills, a first-term congressman representing Florida's 7th District, is facing an Aug. 20 Republican primary challenge from Michael Johnson, a retired Department of Defense employee and Vietnam-era Army veteran from Altamonte Springs.\n\nWhile campaigning, Johnson is handing voters flyers that ask: \"Why does Mills lie about his military service? ... He is committing Stolen Valor.\"\n\nThe term \"stolen valor\" refers to people who make false claims about serving in the armed forces or their military record.\n\nIn particular, Johnson and other critics challenge Mills' claim of earning a Bronze Star medal.\n\nMills — who won a wide-open 2022 Republican primary — has provided The News-Journal with several documents he says prove he served in Iraq in 2003 and earned a Bronze Star with heroism. Also, a seriously wounded soldier's mother says Mills was her son's team leader and was in Iraq, as Mills contends.\n\n“I’m tired of the slander and the defamation,\" Mills said. \"I ran for office to be able to serve the American people, not to defend something I did 20 years ago over and over and over.”\n\nMills is a loyal supporter of former President Donald Trump, who in a 2022 endorsement called the congressman a “wonderful patriot” and “a great fighter for our Country.\" Mills' help in evacuating Americans out of dangerous foreign lands in Afghanistan in 2021, Israel in 2023 and Haiti earlier this year, have gotten him national media attention, as has his analysis as a former sniper after Trump survived an assassination attempt on June 13.\n\nThe News-Journal made a Freedom of Information request to the Army for Mills' Official Military Personnel File and DD Form 214, a document summarizing a soldier's service upon discharge from active duty — on July 15. The documents have yet to be provided to the newspaper, but some have previously been given to Johnson. The News-Journal has confirmed some of the records provided to Johnson are legitimate, as is a medal-confirmation memo Mills shared.\n\nForm shows Bronze Star, but no foreign service\n\nThe DD 214 lists the Bronze Star among the award Mills earned in four years of active duty, ending in 2003. But it contains other errors, Mills said, which critics have used to raise questions about the document.\n\nThey point to section of the document shows no days of foreign service and raise questions about other records Mills has provided.\n\n\"It's very suspicious. It's really red flags,\" Johnson said.\n\nWill Kern, who served more than five years on active duty in the U.S. Marine Corps and nearly another three in the Marine Corps Reserves, knows Mills from their time working together for international security contractor DynCorp. He said he and coworkers had questions about Mills' background then, and still do. He called Mills' DD 214 \"very strange.\"\n\n\"I was heartbroken, as well, to tell you the truth. Having been a former special operator, I know what these men went through to achieve these goals and what these guys have endured, the ones that have been recipients of Bronze Stars and Silver Stars, so just to find out that all of this has just been a lie, it’s just ... it’s mind-blowing,\" Kern said.\n\nJohnson, Kern and others have been contributing documents to the website corymillswatch.com, launched earlier this year by Altamonte Springs businesswoman Jade Murray.\n\nMurray said she received a cease-and-desist letter dated June 11.\n\n“I did receive one letter from a lawyer and I responded to it, and they never responded back. And a lot of what was stated in that letter (weren’t claims I made on the site),\" she said. “I’ve really been very, very careful to not make any claims that I can’t back up.”\n\nFor example, Murray said the attorney accused her of stating that Mills was never deployed.\n\n“I never claimed he wasn’t deployed. I stated what his documents say, that he didn’t have any combat.\n\nSkeptic calls for photos of Mills in Iraq in 2003\n\nKern, who lives in Houston, has gone so far as to offer a reward for photographic evidence of Mills' time in Iraq.\n\n“We are serious: If you can find someone with a picture of Cory Mills in a U.S. military/Armed Forces uniform in Iraq or Afghanistan, we will pay $1,000,” Kern wrote in an email. “It was the most photographed war in our lifetime, and not one picture or video of Cory in uniform, deployed overseas with the U.S. military, has ever been found.”\n\nAfter hearing about the reward, Mills texted two photos to The News-Journal, writing, \"Get your $1,000.\"\n\nAfter looking at the photos and sharing them with others, Kern said he believes the photos were taken during training for the 82nd Airborne medical team in Failaka Island off the coast of Kuwait. Kern said producing a photo of himself in Iraq or Afghanistan with personal protective equipment and a weapon \"shouldn't be a hard request for a hardened, combat Bronze Star recipient.\"\n\nMills has also countered the stolen valor allegations by providing The News-Journal with a copy of his Form 638, the paperwork requesting that Mills receive a Bronze Star, as well as a July 11 Army letter confirming Mills had received the Bronze Star, the Combat Medical Badge and two Global War on Terrorism medals.\n\nMills served in the Army from 1999-2003\n\nMills, 44, is originally from Winter Haven. He is a registered Florida voter at a New Smyrna Beach address and won his congressional seat in 2022. Florida's 7th District includes Seminole and southern Volusia counties.\n\nHe enlisted in the Army in July 1999, when he was 19. He earned an honorable discharge in August 2003, fulfilling his commitment. When he left, he was a member of the Headquarters Company, 1st Division of the 325th Infantry Regiment, part of the 82nd Airborne Division. In March 2003, the 325th took part in the invasion of Iraq.\n\nMills' DD 214 shows he earned a Bronze Star, a Kosovo Campaign medal and expert marksmanship, combat medical, expert field medical and parachute badges. The document also indicates Mills had 0 days of foreign service.\n\nMills says there were errors on his DD 214, which he did not sign, adding he didn't have time to review the document while he was being transitioned off his base. Errors on a DD 214 are \"common,\" Mills said.\n\nMills explained the portion of the document showing no foreign service, saying that line typically does not include deployments overseas, only assignments at bases in Germany, Korea and elsewhere.\n\nSome of Mills' skeptics disagree, saying deployments are usually included as part of the foreign service accounting.\n\nArmy reviews Mills' medals, including Bronze Star\n\nMills claims on his campaign website that he is a \"decorated U.S. Army combat veteran.\"\n\nSome of the skeptics argue Mills couldn't have been awarded a Bronze Star because his records show no foreign service. They question whether he even served in Iraq in 2003.\n\nMills provided The News-Journal two additional documents that he says debunks \"stolen valor\" claims.\n\nThe first came as a result of a review of Mills' medals. Mills said the review came at his request, as he was looking for additional backup to his DD 214 showing he earned the Bronze Star.\n\nThe Army reviewed all of Mills' medals, he said, because the staff discovered he had not been given the Global War on Terror Service Medal or Expeditionary Medal.\n\nWhen Johnson requested Mills' DD 214, the Army redacted the section listing medals.\n\nIn an April 23 letter to Johnson, Col. Christopher Ruga, chief of staff of the Army Human Resources Center at Fort Knox, Kentucky, wrote: \"We have become aware that there may be some inaccurate information in (Mills' Official Military Personnel File) concerning awards, and we are reviewing the records to resolve this issue.\"\n\nAdditionally, sometime in March, a mention of the Bronze Star was edited out of Mills' official Congress biography. Mills told The News-Journal the omission was likely an error as his bio was rewritten to reflect his first year in office.\n\nWhen the Army's review of the medals was complete, a memo signed on behalf of Lt. Col. Damian Tong, chief of the Awards and Decorations Branch, dated July 11 states Mills earned a Bronze Star, a combat medical badge, a Global War on Terrorism service medal and a Global War on Terrorism expeditionary medal.\n\nBill Costello, an Army deputy public affairs officer, confirmed in a separate email that Tong had written the memo in response to the review mentioned by Ruga.\n\nRetired general confirms signing Mills' Bronze Star recommendation\n\nMills furnished The News-Journal with a Form 638, the recommendation for him to earn the Bronze Star. While it shows that he earned the medal and details why, Johnson and others have questions, including the date the form was signed.\n\nArmy Brig. Cmdr. Arnold N. G. Bray's signature is on the Form 638. On one line, Bray's title is listed as brigade commander. On another, it refers to him as\" \"BG (R),\" meaning brigadier general (retired). According to his LinkedIn page and several bios, Bray retired in 2012.\n\nBray himself told The News-Journal that he did sign a recommendation for Mills, but neither he nor Mills answered the question of when it was signed.\n\n\"Cory was one of my (non-commissioned officers) and I awarded all my squad leaders and above the Bronze Star,\" Bray wrote in a text message recently. \"To be clear. Without exception, my soldiers and especially my NCOs were doing things (whereby) uncommon was common.\"\n\nBray also wrote that Mills' actions justifying the award are \"ordinarily submitted by the observing individuals. To be clear, I am not validating any of the specifics.\"\n\nFormer Army soldier Bobby Oller, who served in the 325th from 2002 to 2006, says the bottom of the Form 638 shows that it was created in “Apr 2021.\"\n\n''We all know he had to have this document made after 2021,\" Oller said.\n\nBoth Oller and Johnson say they have spoken to several members of the 325th and has found no one who recalls Mills.\n\nKern wrote: \"Why is it, after all of these years of asking Cory about his military service, all of a sudden he is producing half-assed documents that look ... photoshopped. Why is he sending out 'evidence' that doesn't prove anything?\"\n\nAnother key portion of the 638 is the back and additional pages which would show other Army officials — including the nominating party — signing off on the award. Mills said he did not have the remaining pages.\n\n'Extraordinary heroism and unwavering dedication'\n\nThe Form 638 gives five justifications for Mills to receive the Bronze Star.\n\n“Sgt. Mills distinguished himself by displaying extraordinary heroism and unwavering dedication to duty as an Emergency Medical Treatment Specialist,\" the document states. \"Throughout numerous combat operations, he repeatedly exposed himself to enemy fire to provide life-saving medical care to wounded coalition forces and civilians.\"\n\nThe document states Mills was involved in “multiple grueling campaigns,” fighting in Baghdad, Fallujah, Somalu and “innumerable other towns and villages across Iraq.”\n\nWhile in Baghdad, Mills' unit aided a fellow U.S. unit that \"was pinned down by intense enemy fire.\" A sergeant had been grabbed by an enemy.\n\n\"Jumping into action, Sgt. Mills threw himself at the enemy insurgent and subdued him, saving the life (of the sergeant),\" the document states.\n\nAlso, Mills \"selflessly shared his knowledge and expertise with junior medical personnel, fostering a culture of continuous learning and improvement within the unit.\"\n\nWas Mills involved in Iraq rescue of soldiers?\n\nThe remaining justification provides specifics placing Mills in a particular place and time.\n\nIt credits Mills with helping to save the lives of then-Pvt. Alan Babin Jr., and Pvt. Joe Heit, in a much-retold story dating to March 31, 2003, shortly after the start of the U.S. invasion of Iraq.\n\nBabin was assigned to the headquarters company of the 1st Battalion of the 325th Infantry as a medic.\n\nHe was attached to the 3rd Platoon, Company A, which was positioned in As-Samawah, a city in southwestern Iraq, when Pvt. Joe Heit was injured by gunfire. Babin — who would earn a Purple Heart and Bronze Star with a V device for valor — went to help and was seriously wounded, shot in the stomach.\n\nMills said he was there and aided in the rescue of Babin. His Form 638 states:\n\n\"Sgt. Mills, while under intense enemy fire, came to the aid of two fallen comrades, Corporal Babin and Pvt. Heit, who had been struck by enemy fire. At great risk to his own life, he applied emergency life-saving medical care to both soldiers and assisted in their evacuation back to U.S. Forces, saving the lives of both soldiers.”\n\nRosie Babin, Alan Babin's mother, confirmed Mills was in Iraq with her son.\n\n\"Sgt. Mills was my son, Cpl. Alan Babin's team leader. He was in Iraq and there with my son in As-Samawah when Alan was shot,\" Rosie Babin said in a text message Friday. \"We are still to this day dealing with the effects of that day.\"\n\nMills said the stolen valor accusations have forced him to relive painful memories, such as the day before the As-Samawah mission, when Babin told him he didn't have a good feeling.\n\n\"I told him, ‘Suck it up. This is what we do. Stop trying to think it. Let’s go for it,’ and he was one of the first (expletive) people hit,\" Mills said. \"So, yeah, there’s a little bit of guilt about that.\""
