        "text": "Troy University Chancellor Dr. Jack Hawkins, Jr. paid tribute to area Purple Heart recipients during a luncheon in Ozark on Wednesday as a celebration of National Purple Heart Day.\n\nWednesday’s luncheon was sponsored by the American Legion, the City of Ozark, the American Warrior Real Estate Professional, Disabled American Veterans, AMVETS, the Ozark Area Chamber of Commerce and CCV.\n\nPurple Heart Day was first observed in 2014 as an opportunity to reflect on the bravery of those who have fought for the U.S. to ensure their courage and sacrifice is never forgotten.\n\nOriginally designated as a Badge of Merit, George Washington awarded the honor to three sergeants in the Continental Army on Aug. 7, 1782. In 1932, on what would have been Washington’s 200th birthday, the medal was renamed the Purple Heart and was designated as an honor for those who had been wounded or killed in combat. Gen. Douglas MacArthur was the first to receive the modern Purple Heart for his service in the Pacific theater during World War II. Since that time, 1.8 million Purple Hearts have been awarded, and more than 500,000 soldiers have died in combat.\n\nDr. Hawkins, a Purple Heart recipient himself, served as a platoon leader during the Vietnam War. During his service, he also earned the Bronze Star and a citation from the Korean Marine Corps.\n\n“Today is a special day – Purple Heart Day,” Dr. Hawkins said. “It was Billy Graham who said the two most important but underutilized words in the English language are: thank you. Today, as we recognize National Purple Heart Day, I want to say thank you – thank you for your service and thank you for your sacrifice. America is great because America is good. I want to encourage you to continue to do your part to make our country great by doing good.”\n\nIn 2013, Troy University became the first university in the country to be designated as a “Purple Heart University,” thanks to efforts by TROY alumnus and Purple Heart recipient, KT Cole.\n\nSince 1950, the University has served and supported the Armed Forces and those who are or have served in uniform, their spouses, and their dependents. More than 27 percent of TROY’s total student population is affiliated with the military, and TROY counts more than 60 flag officers among its alumni ranks.\n\nTROY supports its active duty, Reserve, National Guard, and veterans through a number of ways, including the TROY for Troops Centers on campuses in Troy, Montgomery, Dothan, Phenix City, Clarksville, TN and Pensacola, FL locations and a virtual Center at TROY Online. In addition to student lounges and workspaces, the Centers host the SALUTE Honor Society, the Student Veteran Association, a Veterans’ Alumni Association, a Veteran Success on Campus counselor and visiting Department of Veterans Affairs counseling service providers.\n\nTROY also offers its Military and Family Scholarship that caps the cost of tuition at $250 per credit hour for spouses and dependents of members of the military currently serving on active duty, in the National Guard or in the Reserves at undergraduate and graduate levels. Active Duty, Reserves and National Guard servicemembers themselves pay no out-of-pocket tuition costs beyond what military tuition assistance pays."
