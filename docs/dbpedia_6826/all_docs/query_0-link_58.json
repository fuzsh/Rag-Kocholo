        "text": "Ernie Webb wouldn’t send troops to battle alone; he went with them.\n\nThat leadership is on full display as he holds onto his Bronze Star, Silver Star – the third-highest military decoration for valor in combat – and Purple Heart medals. Another ten or so medals hang in a case near him. And with 24 years of military service, he’s seen a thing or two.\n\n“The Army made me who I am today,” Ernie said. “I’m grateful for my time there.”\n\nHe was born in Stillwater, Okla., but now calls Summer Vista Assisted Living in Pensacola, Fla. home. At 86 years old, Ernie has lived in several places, jamming each of those years with life. And he continues leading by example, from military service to authoring a half-dozen books.\n\n“Dad has always been a leader and go-getter, but not the showing-off type,” his daughter Maureen said. \"He's my dad, and I’m so proud of him. We all are.”\n\nErnie completed a two-year stint as an enlisted soldier in the US Army before gaining entry to West Point via a competitive appointment open to Army personnel. Upon graduation, he assumed several leadership roles within the infantry and armor units across Vietnam, Germany, and the United States.\n\n“I loved being at West Point,” Ernie said. “Being there helped teach me about leadership and how to be someone a person would follow.”\n\nDuring a two-year deployment in Vietnam, Webb was awarded the Purple Heart and five valor awards, in addition to receiving both the Silver Star and the Bronze Star for his service. Vietnam landed him in challenging spots, but also a book.\n\nSoldier, by Anthony Herbert and James Wooten, sprinkled Ernie throughout the book, showing his leadership skills as well as his human side.\n\n“War is like nothing else,” Ernie said. “Guys are putting their lives on the line.”\n\nFollowing his time in the military, Ernie dedicated a dozen years to the finance sector as a financial planner and stockbroker. He then channeled his expertise into a two-decade tenure as a leadership consultant, advising Fortune 500 companies across the globe.\n\nA prolific writer, Ernie has contributed a wealth of knowledge on management, leadership, ethics, and interpersonal dynamics. As Editor-in-Chief of Military Review, he was the driving force behind an issue focusing on leadership that not only won accolades but also became the most requested reprint in the publication's 74-year history.\n\nAnd if that wasn’t enough, Ernie taught at West Point. While there, he co-produced a book on life at the Academy titled West Point Sketch Book. Ernie went on to author five other books:\n\n• The Best Government Money Can Buy: Selling Out America\n\n• Rescuing America! We Are Taking Her Back!\n\n• Reclaim Your Inner Core!: Stand On Top Of The Mountain!\n\n• Joshua Freeman\n\n• My Daily Journal\n\nIn addition to a B.S. from West Point, Ernie earned an MA in English Literature from Columbia University in New York. He is a U.S. Naval College of Command and Staff graduate with advanced studies in Qualitative and Quantitative Analysis."
