        "text": "The sprint double was not in the cards for Noah Lyles.\n\nLyles won bronze in the 200-meter sprint Thursday despite testing positive for COVID-19 two days ago, two people close to the situation told USA TODAY Sports. They spoke on condition of anonymity because of the sensitivity of the matter.\n\nLyles was attempting to become the first sprinter to win both the 100- and 200-meter races since Jamaican Usain Bolt did so at the 2016 Rio de Janeiro Olympics, and the first American since Carl Lewis in the 1984 Los Angeles Games.\n\nThe gold medal in the 200 went to Botswanan Letsile Tebogo, who raced out to a comfortable lead before breaking away from the field and cruising to victory, earning the first medal for Botswana at the 2024 Paris Olympics.\n\nWatch Noah Lyles win bronze in 200 meters\n\nLyles hung around after making the turn but appeared incapable of building the speed required to catch Tebogo at the front of the pack. After the race, Lyles was breathing heavily and required medical attention before being carted off the track in a wheelchair. The NBC broadcast reported shortly afterward that Lyles had been diagnosed with COVID-19 two days ago.\n\nWhat were the results of the men's 200-meter race?"
