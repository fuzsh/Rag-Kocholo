        "text": "VALDOSTA, Ga. (WALB) - Moody Air Force Base awarded The Bronze Star Medal to an outstanding airman for their heroic service in the combat zone.\n\nMaster Seargent Peter Pease served as a security forces defender while deployed to Al-Asad Airbase in Iraq for 6 months.\n\nCol. Paul Sheets Moody Air Force Base Commander recognized Pease for his efforts to create strategies and tactics that protected and defended fellow airmen and aircraft during that deployment.\n\nPease said, “This award is to honor everyone that was there with me. I know I received it as an individual but I would have never been there without the rest of the team.”\n\nPease grew up in a small town in Ohio. He has spent the last four years at Moody Air Force Base building his leadership skills and preparing to take his team to the next level.\n\n“This is an extraordinary accomplishment for any airman but it really speaks a lot to the support he receives first from his amazing family for their support and gave him the tools in his upbringing to help could be that inspiration and adhere to the values of the Air Force excellence, service, and dedication to the things that we do,” Sheets said.\n\nPease was able to celebrate this moment with his family and a majority of the 46 airmen that he completed the mission with.\n\nHe said, “It’s all about the people, especially when you get to this level. I don’t just get here if I don’t have a solid core of family, leadership, especially my team. If it wasn’t for that I am not who I am today.”\n\nHave a news tip or see an error that needs correction?
