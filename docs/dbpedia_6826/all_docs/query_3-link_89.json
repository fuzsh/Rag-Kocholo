        "text": "If Team Indiana were a separate nation, it would rank 12th in the medal standings at Paris Olympics.\n\nHoosiers Cole Hocker, Sarah Hildebrandt, Chloe Dygert, Lilly King and Alex Shackell have all won gold in Paris.\n\nPARIS – Featuring rare gold medals by runner Cole Hocker, cyclist Chloe Dygert and wrestler Sarah Hildebrandt, athletes from Indiana are poised to exceed large medal hauls from the previous two Olympic Games.\n\nThrough Wednesday, and with four days of competition left, Indiana-connected Olympians have totaled 15 medals and six golds in Paris.\n\nThat follows 19 medals at Rio de Janeiro 2016 and 20 at Tokyo 2021.\n\nIf Team Indiana were a separate nation, it would rank 12th in the standings, behind Canada’s 19 medals. Canada’s population of 39 million is about six times that of Indiana.\n\nMore from Paris: Lilly King's last Olympic swim ends with gold, world record; Alex Shackell gets medal, too\n\nWith six golds, Indiana would be tied with Canada for 11th.\n\nNotre Dame accounts for seven medals, four in fencing. Carmel accounts for four, three in swimming.\n\nThe state nearly picked up another medal Thursday afternoon from Indiana University diver Carson Tyler, who finished fourth on 3-meter springboard.\n\nReaction to Hocker’s upset victory Tuesday in one of the greatest 1,500-meter races of all time created a near-earthquake in his home state and the United States. The Indianapolis native had a time of 3:27.65, an Olympic record and equivalent to a 3:44.3 mile.\n\nNearly obscured was Yared Nuguse, a Notre Dame graduate who not only won bronze in 3:27.80, but very nearly nabbed gold.\n\nInevitably, there will be attempts this summer to lower the world record of 3:26.00, which has stood since 1998. Hocker is scheduled for 1,500s at Lausanne, Switzerland, on Aug. 22 and Zurich on Sept. 5\n\nNo Indiana runner in 120 years had medaled at a distance longer than 400 meters. At the 1904 St. Louis Olympics, Muncie’s Jim Lightbody won golds in the 800, 1,500 and steeplechase, and Lacey Hearn of Portland, Ind., took bronze in the 1,500.\n\nColumn: Cole Hocker never wavered in his quest to become the best miler in the world.\n\nOther native Hoosiers coming close to distance medals:\n\n∎ Max Truex, Warsaw, was sixth in the 10,000 meters in 1960, setting an American record of 28:50.34.\n\n∎ Charles Hornbostel, Evansville, was sixth in the 800 in 1932 and fifth in 1936.\n\n∎ Don Lash , Auburn, was eighth in the 10,000 in 1936.\n\nIn track cycling, Dygert, of Brownsburg, was part of a U.S. quartet winning a first-ever gold in team pursuit Wednesday. It was her fourth Olympic medal, two less than the record by a female cyclist from any nation.\n\nAmong Hoosiers in all sports, only Evansville swimmer Lilly King, with six, has more medals than Dygert.\n\nAlso Wednesday, Sarah Hildebrandt of Granger took gold in the 110-pound weight class. She became the second Indiana woman to win an individual gold medal, after King in the 100-meter breaststroke in 2016.\n\nHildebrandt, bronze medalist in 2021, also became the second American woman to earn two Olympic wrestling medals, tying Helen Maroulis, who is going for a third Friday.\n\nStill in the mix for individual medals are former Purdue hurdler Devynne Charlton in track and field, Mary Theisen-Lappen in weightlifting, and Mason Parris and Kayla Miracle in wrestling.\n\nPoised for medals in team sports are Notre Dame midfielder Korbin Albert in soccer; Matt Anderson and Annie Drews in men’s and women’s volleyball; the Pacers’ Tyrese Haliburton, Princeton's Jackie Young and Notre Dame’s Jewell Loyd in basketball.\n\nContact IndyStar correspondent David Woods at dwoods1411@gmail.com.
