We don’t shake your hand, pat ’em on the back, say happy Veteran’s Day, and then walk out of the VFW; we owe them the respect that they’ve earned for a lifetime,” Van Orden continued.\n\nThose who, while serving in any capacity with the US Armed Forces in a combat zone, distinguish themselves by bravery, exceptional achievement, or meritorious service that does not require aerial flight may be granted the Bronze Star Medal. During the Vietnam War, over 100,000 Bronze Stars were awarded to U.S. veterans while only 21,630 Bronze Stars with Valor were given."
