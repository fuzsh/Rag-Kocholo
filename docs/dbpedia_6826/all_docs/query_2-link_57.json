        "text": "A native of Charlotte, where he was born in 1908, Dugan Aycock got his start in golf as a caddie at Charlotte Country Club and later as an assistant professional. From that humble beginning, Aycock embarked upon a remarkable career as a golf professional, administrator, promoter, and humanitarian. He served stints as head professional in Badin, Greensboro, and New Bern, but spent 40 years of his career at Lexington GC.\n\nAycock served more years as President of the CPGA than anyone before or since. He was in office from 1948-58 and again from 1966-68. Additionally, he was a PGA of America Vice President from 1959-61 and was voted PGA of America Professional of the year in 1957. Aycock donated much of his time to promoting the game and to aiding fellow PGA Professionals during times of personal crisis.\n\nHenry G. Picard won 30 events on the PGA Tour in the 1930’s and 40’s. His biggest triumphs were the 1938 Masters where he prevailed by two shots and the 1939 PGA Championship in which he defeated Byron Nelson in extra holes.\n\nBorn November 28, 1907 in Plymouth, Massachusetts, Picard came to Charleston CC in 1925 as an assistant professional. He won the Carolinas Open four times before taking the tour by storm. In addition to his numerous titles, he was a member of the U.S. Ryder Cup team in 1935, ‘37, ’39, and ’41.\n\nPicard was also a widely respected teacher, who held professional positions at Hershey CC in Hershey, Pennsylvania and Canterbury CC in Cleveland, Ohio after ending his tour career in 1950.\n\nA longtime resident of Charleston, SC he was elected to membership in the PGA of America Hall of Fame in 1961. Picard is also a member of the SC Athletic, SC Golf and Carolinas Golf Halls of Fame.\n\nBorn in Scotland in 1872, Donald James Ross started his working days as a carpenter, but because he lived close to Royal Dornoch Links, he quickly developed an interest in golf. Ross trained as a professional at St. Andrews, returned to Dornoch in 1893, and remained until 1898 when he emigrated to Boston, MA, where he became greenskeeper at Oakley CC.\n\nIn 1900, Ross moved to Pinehurst CC and later became interested in golf course architecture. He went on to design, build, or remodel over 600 courses, including Pinehurst No. 2, Seminole, Dunedin Inverness, and Oak Hill.\n\nAs a player, Ross won the inaugural North & South Open in 1903 and repeated those victories in 1905 and 1906. He was inducted into the PGA/World Golf Hall of Fame in 1977 and into the Carolinas Golf Hall of Fame in 1981.\n\nArnie wasn’t the first Palmer to brighten the PGA Tour. The original model was Johnny Palmer, a native of Eldorado, NC who worked in the aluminum plant in Badin, NC before turning to golf.\n\nThe playing record of Palmer, who was born in 1918, is impressive. At the local level he won the CPGA Section Championship five times and the Carolinas Open on three occasions. On the PGA Tour, he was an eight-time winner, with his credits including the Canadian Open, the Colonial National Invitational and the Tam O’Shanter World Open when it was the richest event in golf. Palmer also played on the U.S. Ryder Cup Team.\n\nPalmer, a tail-gunner in a B-29 during World War II, was noted for his steady hand and accurate aim – traits the he also carried to his golfing career. He is a member of the Carolinas Golf Hall of Fame and the NC Sports Hall of Fame.\n\nPurvis Jennings Ferree, who was born in Randolph County, NC in 1909 once said, “What I did to promote golf was a small return for what golf did for me.”\n\nFeree considered himself lucky that he had worked at Pinehurst with the great professional/architect Donald Ross and with the great administrator Richard Tufts. Under Ross, he ran the No. 1 course during the summer; under Tufts, he ran the handicap system of the Carolinas Golf Association and also scheduled and conducted the CGA tournaments.\n\nIn 1942, he became head professional at Old Town in Winston-Salem and inherited the job of secretary-treasurer of the CPGA. He served in that position for 24 consecutive terms.\n\nFerree, the 1969 CPGA Professional of the Year, won the 1944 CPGA Section Championship/Carolinas Open, a combined event hosted by Old Town at his own urging.\n\nA big man of 6’2 and 230 pounds, Clayton Vance Heafner was one of the most feared competitors on the PGA Tour in the 1940’s and ‘50’s.\n\nIn addition to winning two Carolinas Open titles and the CPGA Section Championship, Heafner won the Colonial National Invitational, the Jacksonville Open, and two Mahoning Valley Opens on the PGA Tour. However, he is the best remembered for his runner-up performances in two U.S. Opens – one to Cary Middlecoff at Medinah in 1949 and the other to Ben Hogan at Oakland Hills in 1951. He also played on two U.S. Ryder Cups teams and in seven Masters.\n\nHeafner, who was born near Charlotte in 1914, served as an assistant professional in South Boston, VA, and at Sedgefield CC in Greensboro, where under Orville White, he developed his ability as a first rate player. He owned Eastwood GC in Charlotte, which he left to his three children after dying of a heart attack at age 47.\n\nJames Joseph D’Angelo had a full and prosperous career as a golf professional, serving at clubs in his native Pennsylvania, in Oklahoma, and in South Carolina. He is best known as a promoter, one whose efforts turned Myrtle Beach into a golfing mecca.\n\nD’Angelo, who was born in 1909, was involved in the creation of the famous Dunes Golf & Beach Club and served as its first professional; helped organize the South Carolina Chapter of the CPGA; was involved in attracted the Golf Writers Associations of America Championship to the Dunes Club; and became publicity director for Golf Holiday, a promotional organization, after retiring from his post at the Dunes Club in 1968.\n\nHe was named Myrtle Beach Citizen of the Year in 1974 and was officially designated the Grand Strand’s “Mr. Golf.” He is a member of several halls of fames.\n\nD. Grant Bennett, a Winston-Salem, NC native born in 1920, wasn’t famous for his skills as a golfer. He gave up playing baseball because of an arm injury and gave up competitive golf because of an ankle injury and gave up competitive golf because of an ankle injury. Those injuries led him to becoming a golf teacher extraordinaire – the man behind numerous junior champions including such notables as a former Wake Forest Univ. All-American and tour player Jack Lewis Jr, former tour player Mike Holland, and former LPGA player Kathy Hire.\n\nBennett, a pilot during World War II who later became a chemical salesman, started his PGA career as head professional at New Bern G&CC. He later served at Florence CC, at Range End in Harrisburg, PA, at the CC of SC in Florence, and at Wildewood CC in Columbia.\n\nBennet served nearly 30 years as a member of the USGA Junior Committee, was a past junior chairman for the PGA, was twice named SC Professional of the Year, was CPGA Professional of the Year in 1956, and was inducted into numerous sports halls of fame.\n\nJohn Fairley Clark, born in Cumberland Country, NC in 1906, was introduced to the game of golf at the age of 13 when caddying for his scoutmaster. He later became a fine player, finishing eighth in the 1927 U.S. Open at Oakmont, winning the 1929 West Coast Florida Open, and playing in the inaugural Masters in 1934. He also was runner-up in the Southeastern PGA Championship three times.\n\nClark derived most of his pleasure in teaching. He once said, “I enjoy every phase of the golf business, but none more that teaching.”\n\nHe turned professional in 1927 and served as head professional at Fort Bragg Officers Club for 28 years, until his retirement in 1975. He was named CPGA Professional of the Year 1968.\n\nOrville “Whitey” White, who was born in 1908 in Chicago, represents those club professionals who quietly go about their duties without thinking they are anything special. White was something special both as a professional and a teacher.\n\nHis accomplishments included winning the CPGA Section Championship in 1945, the Carolinas Open in 1938 and ’45, the SC Open in 1953, ’54, and ’55, and the Mid South at Pinehurst in 1935. In addition, he played in the Masters in 1935 and ’36, tying for the 15th in 1936. As a teacher, his pupils included Clayton Heafner, who achieved an impressive record on the PGA Tour.\n\nWhite was named Golf Professional Emeritus at Midland Valley Country Club in Aiken, where he was once part owner. He also served at Sedgefield CC in Greensboro and Forsyth CC in Winston-Salem.\n\nA nationally-known golf course architect, Joe Ellis Maples designed and built approximately 70 courses. Born in Pinehurst in 1909, Maples started in the golf business in the late 1920’s as an assistant under the watchful eye of Donald Ross. He served as head professional and superintendent at the following clubs in North Carolina: Plymouth CC(1937-42), New Bern CC(1946-47), Raleigh CC(1950-54), and Pinebrook CC(1954-58). While at Pinebrook in Winston-Salem, he pioneered the use of bentgrass greens in this part of the state. Except for in the mountains, bentgrass greens were unheard of in North Carolina.\n\nAmong the courses to his credit as a designer are Boone GC, Gaston CC, Midland Valley CC, CC of NC, CC of SC, CC of Orangeburg, Pinehurst No. 5, Whispering Pines CC Forest Oaks CC, Greensboro CC (Carlson Fam), Red Fox CC, Cedar Rock CC, Grandfather Mountain CC, Walnut Creek CC, and the Wellman Club.\n\nMaples was a past president of the American Society of Golf Course Architects, a 39-year member of the PGA, and a member of the Golf Course Superintendents Association upon his passing in 1984.\n\nFew have promoted golf as tirelessly as Aubrey C. Apple Sr. Born in 1920, Aubrey started as an assistant professional at Starmount Forest CC in Greensboro in 1946 after a four-year stint in the Air Force. He served as head professional and general manager at Green Valley GC, also in Greensboro, from 1948 until his retirement in 1985.\n\nDedicated to the growth of golf and the ideals of sportsmanship that the game displays, Apple was an accomplished player having competed in the PGA Championship and several Greater Greensboro Opens. He is the holder of three course records in North Carolina.\n\nActive in civic affairs and charitable endeavors, Aubrey served the Carolinas Section as an officer for eleven years, including the office of the President from 1962-65. He was named Professional of the Year in the Carolinas Section in 1965. He served on numerous PGA of America committees and has been a delegate from the Carolinas Section to the National Meeting twenty times. He was instrumental in starting and organizing the Section senior tournament program.\n\nEdward Bennett Bullock was born in Winston-Salem in 1918. In 1943, he joined the U.S. Air Corps and served in both India and China with the Intelligence Corps. From 1954-58, Bullock got his feet wet in the golf business working at Cedarbrook CC in Elkin, NV, Roaring Gap CC in Roaring Gap, NC and Shaw Air Force Base in Sumter, SC. In 1958, Bullock’s life changed as he built the first par-3 course in Myrtle Beach. The following year, he oversaw construction of the Surf Golf & Beach Club in North Myrtle Beach. The Myrtle Beach area had only two courses at that time, a far cry from more than 100 courses that would eventually highlight the region.\n\nBullock served as head professional at the Surf Golf & Beach Club from 1960-71. He then supervised construction and operated the 54-hole Myrtle Beach National complex where he remained until his retirement in 1986. Credited as one of the movers and shakers in the growth of Myrtle Beach golf, Bullock contributed greatly to the area being recognized as the “Coastal Golf Capital of the World.”\n\nWell known for the professionals who trained under his direction, Bullock was recognized by his peers as CPGA Golf Professional of the Year in 1972.\n\nA native of Greensboro, Charles Baxter Farlow was born on Christmas Eve of 1909. For more than half a century, Farlow was a Member of the Section. He was one of the leading teachers in the Carolinas. He trained a number of prominent club professionals including fellow CPGA Hall of Famer Aubrey Apple Sr. His most outstanding student was Carolinas Golf Hall of Famer Marge Burns, also of Greensboro.\n\nFarlow served for 21 years at Starmount Forest GC, frequent site of the Greater Greensboro Open. An accomplished player, he qualified for the U.S. Open eight times and made the cut four times. He also qualified for the PGA Championship five times. Farlow won the CPGA Section Championship in 1940 and the Carolinas Open in 1955. He captured the CPGA Senior Championship in 1962.\n\nFarlow served 40 months in the Army during World War II as a member of General George Patton’s tank division. Following his discharge, he settled into the job at Starmount Forest. Farlow later became head professional at Oak Island in Southport on the NC coast and concluded his career as a teaching professional at green valley country club in his beloved Greensboro. Farlow was the CPGA Golf Professional of the Year in 1978 and passed away in 1979 at the age of 70.\n\nRandall M. Glover dominated professional golf in South Carolina like no other. Born in Sanford, NC in 1941, Glover grew up in Cheraw, SC, where his father was the golf professional. He played well until a stint in the U.S. Army interrupted him in 1964. He came back in 1965, won the Utah Open, and was recognized as the “Most Improved Player” by Golf Digest. Glover captured the Azalea Open in 1967 and gave up the nomadic tour life in 1968.\n\nServing at clubs in Charleston, Summerville, Johnsonville, and Clinton, SC, Glover garnered many Section titles including eight SC Opens, five SC Chapter titles, and two Carolinas Opens. Glover was named the CPGA Player of the Year a record seven times. In 1975, ’76, and ’80, he played for the winning United States team in the PGA Cup matches against Great Britain and Ireland.\n\nAs Section Tournament Chairman and Vice President from 1977-1980, Glover was instrumental in establishing policy and procedures for the Section’s tournament program, considered the finest in the PGA. This modest, soft-spoken professional is a member if the Carolinas Golf Hall of Fame, SC Golf Hall of Fame, and SC Athletic Hall of Fame.\n\nAlfred Goodrich was born in 1922 in Oconto, Nebraska. Turning professional in 1948, he served at the Tides Inn in Irvington, VA and Beechwood Country Club in Ahoskie, NC before moving to Goldsboro GC in 1955. He served the Carolinas Section consistently over the years on committees and as a director, officer, and President from 1975-77. Goodrich was largely responsible for the Carolinas Section securing land and constructing its former headquarters in North Myrtle Beach. He CPGA was the first PGA Section to own its own property and office. Goodrich helped establish the Section’s senior tournament program in the mid 1980’s.\n\nGoodrich was voted CPGA Golf Professional of the Year in 1966, and he was widely known for his fundraising efforts coming to the financial aid of several of his fellow professionals. He was a proficient player, teacher, businessman, and promoter. He captured the 1963 CPGA Pro-Pro Championship with his long-time friend Chuck Alexander.\n\nMelvin Hemphill epitomized the finest aspects of a sport in which sportsmanship and fair play are the basic elements. Born in 1908, in Hattiesburg, Mississippi, he served at the Forest Lake Club in Columbia from the depression days of 1931 to his retirement in December of 1978.\n\nBest known for his teaching, some of Hemphill’s prize students included U.S. Open Champion Jack Fleck, Master’s Champion Tommy Aaron, Canadian and U.S. Amateur Champion Gary Cowan, and PGA Tour standout Gardner Dickenson. Jack Fleck spent two weeks with Hemphill just prior to his playoff victory in the 1955 Open over Ben Hogan.\n\nHemphill was a skilled left-handed player capturing the 1958 SC Open at the CC of Charleston.

From 1935 until 2001, Derr covered the tournament in print, on radio, and on television. He is one of the few reporters who have done so. Derr eventually earned the positions of Sports Director for the CBS network and Director of the World Golf Hall of Fame.\n\nThroughout his career, Derr received numerous accolades including the Golf Writers National Journalism and Masters Major Achievement Awards. He also belongs to the Carolinas Golf Writers and NC Sports Halls of Fame. Derr even received the Bronze Star for his service in the Army Air Corps during World War II.\n\nIn 1975, Derr was asked to temporarily become the CPGA, Executive Director while the Section searched for a permanent employee. The proposed term of three months turned into 10 years of service. After his retirement in 1984, he continued to serve as Special Counsel to the Section for a number of years.\n\nDerr saw it all in the game of golf and experienced more in the world than one person could ever imagine. He had more stories to tell than there was time. His vivid memory could provide insight on some of the most powerful leaders and famous celebrities of the 20th and 2Ist centuries. Age never slowed him down, proven by his first hole-in-one at the age of 92.\n\nGrover Bullin, PGA was born in North Carolina in 1920 and has been a member of the Carolinas PGA Section for 66 years. Bullin is a cornerstone of developing the game of golf in Eastern North Carolina. He spent the entirety of his professional golf career as Head Golf Professional at Wilson County Club starting in 1947 until his retirement in 1989. During his career at Wilson CC, Bullin was known for his selfless approach to the game and his work to cultivate programs for junior and women golfers.\n\nFollowing his retirement from Wilson CC, Bullin continued to grow the game by teaching lessons for the Wilson County Parks and Recreation Department and developed fundraisers for underprivileged youth in the area. He is currently an active supporter of the Mulligans Fore Kids Golf Tournament, which helps give children with disabilities a second chance.\n\nBullin was elected Carolinas PGA Golf Professional of the Year in 1962. He served on the CPGA Board of Directors from 1964-1966. Wilson Country Club annually gives to Golf Scholarship at Barton College in his name. The Grover Bullin Endowed Scholarship was established in 1989, at the time of his retirement, and is used in place of institutional aid to a member of the golf team.\n\nPeggy Kirk Bell was born in Findlay, Ohio in 1921 and started playing golf at the age of 18. Bell attended Rollins College where she was a member of the golf team. She competed in various amateur golf tournaments in the 1940s compiling one of the most successful women’s amateur careers in the history of golf. She won three Ohio Amateur Championships, the 1949 Titleholders Championship, and the North and South Women’s Amateur. Bell turned professional in 1950, the LPGA Tour’s inaugural season, at the urging of her good friend Babe Zaharias, and continued to play a limited schedule on the tour.\n\nThroughout her career, Peggy Kirk Bell has been an ambassador for the game of golf to many generations. In 1953, Bell and her late husband Warren “Bullet” Bell took over Pine Needles Lodge &Golf Club in Southern Pines, NC and developed the resort into what it is today. Under the leadership of Bell, Pine Needles has turned out some of the top PGA Professionals in the Carolinas. The resort is also credited with bringing national attention to the Pinehurst area by hosting three U S. Women’s Open Championships in 1996, 2001, 2007, and 2022.\n\nSome of Bell’s significant honors include 1961 LPGA Teacher of the Year, Golf Digest’s “One of the Six Best Women Teachers in the World; Winner of the first LPGA Senior Championship, 1990 LPGA’s Ellen Griffin Rolex Award, 2004 inductee into Golf Magazine’s World Golf Teacher Hall of Fame (first woman), and 1950 USDA Curtis Cup Team Member. She currently serves as the Chairwoman for the largest girl’s golf tour in the country, the Peggy Kirk Bell Golf Tour.\n\nCharles “Chip” King, a native of Canada, came to the U.S. in 1977 to pursue a career in golf. Elected to PGA Membership in 1982, King had some of the finest mentors in the industry. He began his career in the states under Buck Adams at the CC of North Carolina. His first Head Professional position was at Highland CC. He later held the positions of Head Professional, Director of Golf, and General Manager at Pine Needles Lodge & GC and Mid Pines Inn & GC with Peggy Kirk Bell and her family. King credits Adams and Kirk Bell, both of whom are members of the CPGA Hall of Fame, as having a direct influence on shaping him as a person and as a PGA Professional. He currently serves the members at Grandfather Golf & CC as Director of Golf.\n\nKing has received several awards throughout his distinguished career. He was honored as the 2001 CPGA and 2002 PGA of America Resort Merchandiser of the Year and was the recipient of the 1991 CPGA Professional of the Year Award, the 1999 and ’94 Bill Strausbaugh Awards, and the 1996 and ’89 Horton Smith Awards.\n\nKing served the Carolinas Section as a Board of Directors Member, Secretary, Vice President, President, and Honorary President. He assisted or led the following CPGA Committees: Hall of Fame, Constitution, Education, Membership, Assistants, and Junior Golf. On the National level, he sat on the PGA of America’s President’s Council and Education Committee.\n\nAll of his accolades and accomplishments are noteworthy. However, King takes just as much pride in his history of mentoring and training the Golf Professionals of tomorrow. He has helped dozens of PGA Interns find employment in the golf industry and has placed many of his Assistants in Head Professional positions around the country. Such devotion to others has earned King the enduring respect of countless club members. employees. and industry leaders.\n\nEd began his professional career in 1979 at the UNC Finley Golf Course under PGA member Ed Kenney. Upon his election to membership on April 1, 1983, he was promoted to PGA head golf professional. Since that election, he demonstrated a willingness to serve the Section at every opportunity. He served as Chairman of multiple committees including Education, Membership, Club Relations, and Teaching. He was elected to two terms as a CPGA Board Member, Tournament Chairman, Secretary, and Vice-President. Since 1986, he has served on the national PGA education faculty as a subject matter expert in Teaching for Business Schools I, II, and III, the Golf Professional Training Program, and the current Professional Golf Management Program. On April 1, 1991, he earned distinction as the PGA’s 86″ Master Professional.\n\nIn April 1988, he was hired by Duke athletic director, Tom Butters, to serve as the General Manager and subsequently, the PGA Director of Golf at Duke University Golf Club. 2015 marks his 27th year at the facility. In his 32 years as a PGA Member, Ed has won numerous awards on both a Section and National level. He received the PGA National Bill Strausbaugh Award in 1995 and the PGA National Horton Smith Award in 1998.\n\nThe Bill Strausbaugh Award recognizes a PGA member who has made significant contributions through the mentoring of PGA Professionals and impacting their careers. The Horton Smith Award is designed to recognize PGA golf professionals for their outstanding and continuing contributions to developing and improving educational opportunities for the PGA golf professional. At a National level, receiving one award is an incredible honor; receiving two is a rare and remarkable accomplishment.\n\nWithin the Section itself; Ed has the honor of receiving the Carolinas PGA Horton Smith Award in 1990, 1998, and 2004; the Carolinas PGA Teacher of the Year Award in 1991 and 2003; and the Carolinas PGA Golf Professional of the Year Award in 2001. The Hall of Fame Award is his 10th Award as a PGA Professional and his 8th Section Award. Additionally, Ed has been on the Golf Magazine Top 100 Teachers in America list since 2001, as well as being listed as one of the North Carolina’s Top Instructors by Golf Digest Magazine.\n\nFrom his longtime efforts at Duke, to his ability to hold numerous Section and National Committee positions while also serving as an officer in the Carolinas Section, he still finds time to volunteer with other golf associations, and to share his passion to grow this great game.\n\nRon was first elected to PGA membership in July 1975, while working at Duke University Golf Club — a place he called home for more than a decade. He served as the Women’s Golf Coach, Head Golf Professional, and later, as the Executive Director of the school’s athletic fundraising organization. He guided Duke to its first NCAA tournament appearance in 1983 and then to its first Women’s Golf ACC Championship in 1984. He led Duke to six tournament wins in his time as coach and captured a seventh place finish at the NCAA Championship in 1984. He was selected by the Collegiate Golf Coaches Association as the Regional Golf Coach of the Year in 1984. Coaching, recruiting, and teaching young golfers is one of the best ways to promote the game of golf and Ron did just that throughout his career.\n\nIt wasn’t until 1999 that Ron began his life-changing, 16-year role as Executive Director of the Carolinas PGA Section – a position he assumed both at the Myrtle Beach, SC and Greensboro, NC offices. Ron was pivotal in developing a strong relationship with the Bryan Foundation to relocate the Carolinas PGA Section Office to Greensboro and develop a beautiful, new headquarters at Bryan Park Golf Course.\n\nDuring his time at the Section, Ron not only made a commitment to the PGA’s largest section but to many worthy organizations as well. This includes Play Golf America, Patriot Golf Day and the Folds of Honor Foundation, The First Tee, Adaptive Golf, and Drive, Chip and Putt — a program he still volunteers with at the Section level even after having retired in December 2015. While at the Section, Ron was also a member of the Executive Director Committee, Play Golf America Committee, Scholarship Committee, PGA Communications Committee, Awards and Honors Committee, Hall of Fame Committee, Finance Committee, Education Committee, Code of Ethics Committee, and Sponsors Committee, bolstering an even greater commitment to the Association and its members. Ron embraced all of these initiatives and more while proudly wearing the PGA badge, and continues to today as a PGA Life Member.\n\nAdding to these accolades are also supplemental awards and achievements that Ron has earned over the years including, The President’s Council Award on Growing the Game from 2005-2007, leading the Carolinas PGA Section to win a National Herb Graffis Award in 2007, launching the Section’s most celebrated annual event, the Merchandise Show, and, on top of that, being a chief supporter for the Folds of Honor Foundation, of which he helped the Section to garner over $3,000,000 in donations between 2007 and 2015 (raising $500,000 alone in one year from over 150 Section facilities). Ron’s ability to grow the game and the Section so immensely over the years speaks volumes to his commitment as a PGA Member and to his passion for golf.\n\nBobby Howard, of Lexington, SC, began his professional career when he was elected to PGA membership in 1964. Howard’s impact throughout his career reached all across the Carolinas, and beyond, with his promotion of the game at his multiple owned courses, leadership in South Carolina golf, the Carolinas PGA, the community, and his overall love for teaching and sharing the game.\n\nEarly in his career, Bobby was very influential with the South Carolina Chapter. In 1967 he was President of the Chapter and grew membership from 40 to 120 golf professionals.\n\nHoward served at the Carolinas PGA President from 1969-1970. In this time, he influenced many professionals and made some lasting impacts on the Section. One of the most notable moves during his presidency was his responsibility for acquiring the land and building our Section’s new Headquarters Office in Myrtle Beach, South Carolina. Along with this change, he appointed a Committee to re-write the CPGA Constitution, implementing many significant changes for the Carolinas. “I was elected as President in the Carolinas and I got a couple colleagues to help me re-write the constitution,” said Howard. “We divided the Section into three chapters; South Carolina had their own and North Carolina had two chapters. This allowed South Carolina Professionals to continue playing their tournaments as they had been, but allowed them the ability to become a national PGA Member. That was one of my proudest accomplishments.”\n\nIn conjunction with being a great leader, Bobby was a great player. In 1970, Bobby won the Carolinas Pro-Pro Championship with Bobby Mitchell. He also holds the course record at the Country Club of Charleston with a 62. He was an advocate for playing the game, as he was responsible for the first $1,000 South Carolina Open and the first $10,000 Carolinas Open. As a testament to his overall great leadership, professionalism, and playing ability, Howard won the Carolinas PGA Golf Professional of the Year award in 1971 after only 6 years as a PGA Member.\n\nBobby owned and operated five golf courses across the Carolinas and was extremely gracious when it came to allowing access to his facilities. In 1972, Bobby became the first golf professional in South Carolina to allow a minority golf team to practice and play at his facilities at Sedgewood Golf Club in Columbia, SC. The South Carolina State golf team had no place to go but Bobby welcomed them with open arms. Opening up his facility to this team was not his only move to welcome all to the game. His club in NC, Broadmoor Golf Links, was the first club to welcome the Skyview Open, a legendary African American tour event.\n\nBobby’s work in the 1970’s was not done as he began work on the National Hagen Committee in 1971 in starting and conducting the Walter Hagen Cancer Society Tournament in South Carolina. He worked with this for many years, sending SC winners to the National tournament in Florida. As a National Committee Member through 1983, Bobby helped raise $2.8 million for the fight against cancer.\n\n“It means a lot [to be inducted] because I know practically every one of the Hall of Fame Members. I can think back and it gives me a lot of fond memories,” says Howard, when reflecting on his career and the numerous connections he has made. “I really enjoyed serving as President for a couple years, being on the Executive Committee for 14 years, and have enjoyed being a PGA Professional for nearly 52 years.”\n\nA Virginia native, Jerry Hogge started his career in golf in 1972 at Argyle Country Club as an Assistant Professional. He later went to Lakewood Country Club and in 1975 became Vice President and Director of Golf for the Canaan Valley Golf Resorts soon before pursuing his PGA membership. Hogge began his professional career when he was elected into membership in 1977. Once he earned his membership, he not only spent most of his time as a member in the Carolinas but has solely dedicated his career to the PGA Golf Management Program at Methodist University over the past 32 years.\n\nThe PGA Golf Management Program at Methodist University in Fayetteville, NC would not be the caliber program it is today if it were not for Mr. Hogge. In 1987, Hogge began his career with the program, taking over as Director and implementing many changes and enhancements through adversity in accreditation and acceptance. Two of his goals when he came to Methodist University 32 years ago were to erect a building to house the program and build a golf course for the PGA students. With inspiration spurred from dissonance in his vision, Hogge established this as his “Field of Dreams.” Developments such as these, along with many other personal and professional development models for his students, Hogge’s perseverance and persistence led the program to its accreditation by the PGA of America in 1999.\n\nAt the Section level, Jerry Hogge is a multi-award winner, earning the 1999 Carolinas PGA Horton Smith Award for his efforts and “outstanding contributions in the area of developing and improving education opportunities for the PGA Professional.” In 2001 he earned the Carolinas PGA Bill Strausbaugh Award, given annually to a PGA Professional who has “distinguished themselves by mentoring fellow PGA Professionals, contributions to their community and to local charitable organizations, and overall promotion of the game of golf and the Association.” Subsequently, Hogge won the National PGA of America Bill Strausbaugh Award in 2002.\n\nNational Committees have had the honor of having Hogge serve with them over many years. From 2002-2004, Hogge served on the National Education Committee. Following this, from 2004-2006, he served as a National Education Task Force member. From 2007-2008, Hogge served on the National Employment Committee and Council. His dedication to committees in these spaces confirms his belief that “employment and education are the foundations of any profession.”\n\nHogge is described in many words by those he has encountered and impacted throughout his career. Descriptors include mentor, colleague, teacher, leader, father, grandfather, friend – the list goes on. As a faith-based man, Hogge leads by example and has a servant heart that has shone through for many years. With over 1,100 graduates to come out of the golf program, his impact has multiplied across the industry. In the community, Hogge’s reach is vast. He has served as a Sunday School teacher for 28 years and when he is not spending time with PGA professionals, students, or parents, the Shoebox Ministry for Samaritan’s Purse is one of his true joys.\n\nAs a humble servant to his Section, Association, and community for over 42 years, Hogge is very deserving of this honor. The timing could not be more perfect as Hogge transitioned from his 32 years of service as Director of his prized PGA Golf Management program to Director Emeritus, appointed by the University. Describing his own leadership ability as “inspiring students and my fellow PGA professionals by being committed to education and change,” he has certainly lived this out. For his numerous contributions to the game, the Carolinas PGA is honored to welcome such an outstanding PGA Professional as the 49th Inductee into the Carolinas PGA Hall of Fame.\n\nHaving begun his golf career as an assistant in the late 1970’s, Rick Murphy became passionate about the prospect of promoting the game of golf quickly and earned his PGA Membership in 1981. Throughout the 80’s and into the 90’s, Murphy served as Head Professional and went on to assume the Director of Golf responsibilities at The Cardinal Golf Club by Pete Dye in Greensboro, North Carolina. He was instrumental in growing youth golf at his facility with the creation of the first ever “Clubs for Kids Day” in the mid 80’s. The day was full of various topics of instruction, a show featuring a trick shot artist, and concluded with each kid that attended receiving a golf club. This day gained attention locally and nationally and reached 1500 kids in its second year. This was the start of Murphy’s wide-spread promotion of the game as the program turned Section-wide. These activities led to him receiving the first ever PGA of America Junior Golf Leader Award in 1988.\n\nMurphy’s promotion of the game was just beginning as he continued for years to create opportunities for numerous juniors to get involved with golf while serving as a leader and example for other PGA Professionals and Associates. “Leadership for me is being a doer every day. I would describe my leadership mindset and ability as taking a challenge and tackling it with a well thought out plan and executing it; never being afraid to make a mistake,” says Murphy. “Leadership is helping others achieve their personal best.”\n\nThis leadership philosophy was lived out perfectly when Murphy was hired to assist the Country Club of Bogota in Bogota, Colombia from 1995-1999. His work in teaching and coaching youth golf in the United States was noticed all the way in Colombia as he was brought on to assist with their golf operation, grow their youth programming, and mentor eight Colombian Golf Professionals in an effort to make them better instructors. One of Murphy’s largest impacts there came when he helped build the CC of Bogota daily youth clinic participation from roughly 45 kids to over 160 kids.\n\nHis service to the Carolinas Section as a leader has been profound. He has served on numerous committees, beginning in the 80’s until present day. His Board service kickstarted when he assumed the role of Carolinas PGA Secretary in 2002 and subsequently move into the Carolinas PGA President role in 2006. This position allowed him the insight into the Section leadership’s decision to sell the longtime Section Headquarters property in North Myrtle Beach, South Carolina in 2008. Murphy was instrumental in building a team of support in the Greensboro area which created a team of key leaders who were able to create a highly desirable business arrangement and site location for the new headquarters which was unanimously approved by the Carolinas PGA Board in 2011.\n\nRick Murphy’s name is not only well-known across the Carolinas but is also tied to significant National impact. Murphy served on the National Board of Directors as the District 10 Director from 2013-2016. One of the most significant accomplishments during his tenure was when he jumped at the opportunity to help PGA Members provide more value to their employers, grow participation, and drive additional revenues. This was the driving factor for his creation and development of the PGA of America Inaugural Youth & Family Golf Summit in 2014. This summit has expanded to a two-day PGA Global Youth & Family Summit and has continued every other year under Murphy’s leadership as Chairman. Transitioning his passion back to the Carolinas Section, Murphy developed a similar Carolinas PGA Fall Teaching & Coaching Summit, as well as a Teaching Summit hosted each year in conjunction with the Carolinas PGA Annual Meeting, which he has helped oversee for the past four years.\n\nAt the conclusion of his service on the National Board of Directors, Murphy witnessed the creation, growth, and quick success of PGA Jr. League. His passion for youth development closely aligned with the goal of the program so he suggested the creation of a PGA Junior League Advisory Team in 2016. This team would be comprised of highly engaged PGA Members from across the country to assist in the program’s growth and serve as conduits for local PGA Professionals hosting PGA Jr. League across the country. Murphy served as Chairman of this Advisory Team from 2016-2018.\n\nTo this day, Murphy is actively involved as a host for PGA of America Junior Golf Camps, has served as a First Tee facility, and has engaged with Special Olympics Athletes at his facility for over 18 years. All his years of service have earned him numerous Carolinas Section awards, including the 2016 PGA Professional Development Award, 2009 & 2001 Teacher of the Year Award, 2008 Golf Professional of the Year Award, 1987 Junior Golf Leader Award, and a five time winner of the Junior Golf Promoter of the Year.\n\nOne of the most rewarding moments of Murphy’s life to date has been running for PGA of America Secretary in 2016 and 2018. His motivation: “I wanted to continue to serve our PGA Members and our Association into the future and wanted to have the opportunity to help improve the lives and careers of our PGA Members and to grow the game of golf.”\n\nA colleague summarized Rick Murphy’s service perfectly: “Rick has {accomplished all his goals} through unselfish service, mentorship and giving of his knowledge, passion, and most importantly, friendship.” There is no better embodiment of all it means to be a PGA Professional, serve your Association, and promote the game of golf than Rick Murphy. Murphy says, “My hope is that I have made a positive impact on PGA Members’ lives and their careers.”\n\nMurphy will be inducted into the CPGA Hall of Fame, tentatively scheduled on Sunday, February 21, 2021 at Greensboro Country Club – Irving Park. This ceremony will take place during the Club Car CPGA Awards & Honors Dinner where the Section annually celebrates the accomplishments of outstanding CPGA Professionals.\n\nZack was recruited into the golf business by his long-time mentor Luke Veasey, PGA, Head Golf Professional at Hillandale Golf Course in Durham, NC after attending the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill where he studied Political Science. Zack had learned to play the game and to grow an appreciation for the golf business while growing-up and working at Hillandale as a teenager. During his time as Head Golf Professional and as Director of Golf at Hillandale Golf Course, Veasey and his team had several accomplishments to further the growth of golf to minority groups in the area. These accomplishments included partnering with the Bull City Golf Club Foundation. His team also founded the Bull City Youth League. He made Hillandale the home course of North Carolina Central University and grew the diversity of the game by hiring LPGA and African-American PGA Professionals. Over one-million rounds of golf were played at Hillandale Golf Course during his twenty-two years at the course.\n\nDuring his time at Hillandale Golf Course, he was Carolinas PGA Public Merchandiser of the Year ten times, PGA of America Merchandiser of the year twice, Carolinas PGA Golf Professional of the Year, and recipient of the PGA Professional Development Award and Bill Strausbaugh Award. He served on the Carolinas PGA Board of Directors for seven years, including two years as the Carolinas PGA President. He also served on the PGA of America Board of Directors for three years and on several Carolinas PGA and PGA of America Committees, often as the Chairperson. Following his years at Hillandale Golf Course, Veasey became a managing partner of Global Value Commerce in 2006.\n\nTillman (Tim) Moss was known for his infectious sense of humor, commitment to family and friends, and magnetic personality. Tim started as an Assistant at Harbour Town Golf Links in 1971 and he inspired PGA professionals as well as the game of golf for 40 years. He served his time with the Carolinas Section on the Board of Directors for many years as an officer, including Secretary, Vice President, and President. He served on several committees including the Tournament Committee, the Teaching Committee, and was the Chairman of the Education committee. He was active in the Lowcountry Chapter, and instrumental in making Secession Golf Club what it is today as well as being a first-class teaching professional with numerous clubs in the area including Sea Pines and Moss Creek. Mr. Moss always displayed a professional demeanor and was the most humble and gracious person you could meet. He inspired others as a golf professional to become a better golf instructor by learning how to make each person’s swing better rather than trying to overhaul or change a swing completely. He never took credit for his efforts and went along promoting the game he loved without any hesitation. Tim was often thought of as “the Godfather of golf in the Lowcountry”. Tim promoted the game of golf and coached thousands of golfers during his time. In 1999, was selected as the swing advisor in Robert Redford’s film, The Legend of Bagger Vance. Tim was told he had twenty-eight days to make a non-player (Matt Damon) a believable player and he succeeded. He also wrote a book titled ‘Play Your Best All the Time’ in 2014 forwarded also by Robert Redford. His quoted best golf tip of all time was a Mel Gibson line from The Patriot which was “Remember what I told you about shooting, aim small, miss small.”"
