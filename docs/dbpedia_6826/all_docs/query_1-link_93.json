        "text": "Col. Spannaus was born on Sept. 1, 1930 in Hutchison, Minnesota. He served 26 years in the military, and ended his military career, after serving seven years in Big Spring, at Webb Air Force Base in 1978. He was the final Wing Commander at Webb. He was a fighter pilot in the U.S. Air Force who accumulated over 9,000 hours of single engine and fighter time, serving over 12 of those years in foreign countries.\n\nAs part of his flight time logged, while serving in Korea and Southeast Asia, he flew 222 combat missions over hostile territories. Throughout his military career, he was awarded 40 decorations for distinguished combat flight and exemplary service. A small glimpse into his awards includes: 16 Air Medals, the Bronze Star with Valor, two Distinguished Flying Crosses, two Legion of Merits, and many others reflecting his accomplishments and service over 26 years.\n\nThis brief bio courtesy: Amanda Duforat."
