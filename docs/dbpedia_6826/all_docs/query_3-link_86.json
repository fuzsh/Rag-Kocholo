        "text": "CLARKSTON, WA- Donald Floyd Johnson served as an engineman third class in the United States Navy Reserve.\n\n\" It was an honor to serve my country in uniform,\" Don Johnson said.\n\nToday Congresswoman Cathy McMorris-Rodgers paid a visit to the Clarkston VFW to present veteran Don Johnson with the Bronz Star Medal for his service in Vietnam.\n\n\" For meritorious service while serving with friendly foreign forces engaged in armed conflict against the north Vietnamese and Vietcong,\" Congresswoman Cathy Mcmorris-Rodgers said.\n\nWhen Don Johnson was sent to Vietnam, he had orders to be out on the river as an advisor to a Vietnamese boat but when he arrived at the assignment office, they looked at his service records and couldn't find advanced education in engine training.\n\nHowever, Johnson recently graduated with a degree in agriculture and a farmer is what was needed. He was sent to Commander Naval Forces Vietnam where he started a program that would assist Vietnamese Navy dependents improve their diets and standards of living.\n\n\" I surveyed the bases part of the time. I helped Vietnamese set up their garden and small animal projects and I had a tremendous year in the country,\" Johnson said.\n\n\" In addition, he contributed many of his off-duty hours help build dependent shelters, a livestock breeding shelter, and fish and poultry projects,\" Congresswoman Mcmorris-Rodgers said.\n\nFor this exact work he is being honored today, he shared that he feels humbled and happy that many came out to see him be honored.\n\n\" When this many people turn out to see you awarded and honored its almost more than a person can take, I don't know why I haven't broken down and cried but I feel like doing that,\" Johnson said.\n\nDon Johnson also shared with me that when he came home from Vietnam, he had less than four years in his enlistment making him eligible for separation which he decided to go home and help his mom and dad on the farm."
