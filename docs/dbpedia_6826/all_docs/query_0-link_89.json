        "text": "PORTSMOUTH — Former U.S. Sen. Jim Webb, D-Va., pledged to champion the issue of economic fairness if he decides to run for president.\n\nWebb said the economic opportunities for many Americans “have actually gotten a lot worse” since he first ran for the U.S. Senate in 2006.\n\n“The model has changed, the labor model has changed, particularly for younger people,” Webb said during an appearance Friday afternoon at an event at the Pease International Tradeport hosted by Renee and Dan Plummer of Two International Group.\n\nThere are now 53 million workers in America who are “free-lancers,” Webb said, which means they don’t get important benefits like health care coverage.\n\nHe called for growing the economy to make sure that “people in this country can feel that everybody has a shot, just a shot toward the American dream.”\n\nWebb, a Marine who earned the Navy Cross, the Silver Star Medal, two Bronze Star medals and two Purple Hearts for heroism while serving in Vietnam, reminded about 50 people who attended the event that he wrote an op-ed for the Washington Post five months before the U.S. invaded Iraq saying it was a terrible idea.\n\n“I laid out on strategic grounds why I believed it was a great error for our county,” Webb said.\n\nHe pointed to what has happened since the United States invaded, including the growth of Iran’s power and the break-up of society in Iraq.\n\n“The fact is we can achieve our national objectives without becoming an occupying power in that part of the world,” Webb said.\n\nHe called for the creation of “a new strategic doctrine” for the country “where we can clearly lay out the conditions under which we’re going to use military force.”\n\nHe pointed to what he sees as failures of our foreign policy over the last decade, including the invasion of Iraq — which has strengthened Iran, he said — and President Barack Obama’s decision to unilaterally bomb Libya.\n\n“I think it set a terrible precedent,” Webb said. “The way it happened it in Libya has affected the rest of the region.”\n\nPointing to his military service and his time as Secretary of the Navy and Assistant Secretary of Defense for Reserve Affairs, Webb said he has a lot to offer when voters think about “who would you be comfortable with as commander and chief.”\n\nIn addition, he grew up in a military family and his son served in Iraq.\n\n“It’s a world … I believe I understand, in a fairly unique way,” he said about the military.\n\nAsked a question about how he would balance the budget, Webb acknowledged candidly, “I don’t know realistically who’s going to say they can come up with an idea where they can actually balance the budget.”\n\nHe said there are, however, ways to increase revenues and improve efficiencies.\n\n“We really need to grow our way out of the situation we found ourselves in,” Webb said.\n\nHe called for incentivizing American corporations who are holding “trillions of dollars overseas” to return that money back home by cutting the corporate tax rate and eliminating tax loopholes.\n\nAfter the event, he told the Portsmouth Herald he didn’t think it is necessary to means test Social Security or Medicare to deal with the national debt.\n\n“I think there are ways to approach the budget,” Webb said. “I wouldn’t agree with those two points.”\n\nHe noted the top 10 hedge fund operators made over $1 billion last year, and said the government should look toward them.\n\n“If you want to live the American dream fine, but pay your fair share,” Webb said. “You can’t just go after somebody who’s sitting there on Medicare.”\n\nHe supports dropping the corporate tax rate to 25 percent as a way of bringing companies back to America and growing the economy.\n\nOn other important issues, Webb said after the Citizen’s United Supreme Court case, the “lid blew off on a level playing field” concerning running for office.\n\nHe noted he recently filed paperwork to start an exploratory campaign about running for president, and the most anyone can donate is $2,700.\n\n“You can walk across the street and create a Super PAC and put $27 million in it and people are doing it,” Webb said.\n\nOne way to deal with the issue is not benefiting from Super PAC money, he said.\n\n“If it’s ethically wrong, don’t do it,” Webb said.\n\nOn the issue of women in combat, Webb believes “where we are right now the military itself is making those judgments and that’s where it should be.”\n\nHe described China’s ongoing efforts to make “clear sovereignty claims in the entire South China sea” as a “very serious national security issue.”\n\nAsked when he would decide if he was going to run for president, Webb quipped, “soon,” to laughter from the audience.\n\n“I’ve been to Iowa several times,” Webb said smiling. “I’m happy to be in New Hampshire.”\n\nHe also called for both parties to work together to end paralysis in Washington.\n\n“I think that’s what we need to do for the country,” Webb said."
