It has 30 gold, 38 silver and 35 bronze.\n\nSilver medalist Daniel Roberts' long-distance celebration\n\nTeam USA's Daniel Roberts celebrated his second-place finish in the 110-meter hurdles with his loved ones on a video call.\n\nOn a large screen next to the track, four of Roberts' loved ones were ready to share the moment with him from the U.S.\n\nIt was almost 10 p.m. in Paris, but in the U.S. it was only midafternoon. One of his relatives Zoomed in from a classroom where his students were finishing up the school day and filing out of class.\n\n\"Great job, bro; I love you, bro,\" his relative said.\n\nHolloway keeps his undefeated hurdles streak alive\n\nGrant Holloway of Team USA hasn't lost a race all year — he's won all 20 hurdle races he has participated in (indoors and outdoors) — so it wasn't really a surprise when he crossed the line first today.\n\nWith his win in the 110-meter hurdles, Holloway claimed his first Olympic gold. He was upset in Tokyo, where he took silver.\n\nThe U.S. has won 20 gold medals in the history of this event, twice as many as the rest of the world combined (10).\n\nDaniel Roberts of Team USA grabbed his first Olympic medal, finishing second for a silver.

This is her second Games and her first Olympic medal. She made the final in this event in Tokyo but was disqualified for a lane violation.\n\nThe U.S. has 13 medals in the history of this event. No other country has more than four.\n\nCockrell's time, 51.87, makes her the fourth-fastest woman in this event on record, behind McLaughin-Levrone, of course, and the Netherlands' Femke Bol and American Dalilah Muhammed.\n\nBut today, Cockrell bested Bol, who took home bronze.\n\nSo just how long has it been since Sydney McLaughin-Levrone has lost a race?\n\nSydney McLaughlin-Levrone turned 25 yesterday and got herself a gold medal in the 400-meter hurdles as a present today.\n\nMcLaughin-Levrone is so dominant she hasn't lost a single 400 hurdles race since October 2019, when she was 20.\n\nShe is the first woman ever to win multiple gold medals in the event.\n\nShe has set world records in her last six global or U.S. championships. Starting with the U.S. Olympic Trials in 2021, McLaughin-Levrone set the record with a time of 51.90 seconds. She has only cut it down since, setting a 51.46 record in Tokyo, then 50.68 at the 2022 worlds, then 50.65 at the U.S. trials in Eugene, Oregon, this year and now Paris, with 50.37.\n\nA tip of the hat to first-time gold medal winner Tara Davis-Woodhall\n\nWoodhall, of Team USA, claimed gold in the long jump today, keeping her fourth-round best length of 7.10 meters.\n\n\"I just couldn’t keep it together; I was screaming in my head,” Davis-Woodhall told Reuters about what was going through her head on her final jump. \"I had the crowd in my hands, and that’s what I dreamed of. I made people watch long jump.\"\n\nAccording to Reuters, Davis-Woodhall choked back tears before she sprinted down the runway one final time. After she landed, she stood up before she fell back into the sand with a big smile on her face.\n\nShe donned her trademark cowboy hat and boots to celebrate her first Olympic gold.\n\nTebogo says 200-meter gold 'means a lot' to Africa\n\nReporting from Stade de France, Paris\n\nBotswana’s Letsile Tebogo said becoming the first African to win the men’s 200-meter gold “means a lot to the African continent.”\n\nHe said not being among the favorites for the race gave him “courage.”\n\n“I didn’t look for the gold medal; I just thought maybe if I could be on the mix, I’ll be happy,\" he said.\n\nAsked whether he would have beaten Noah Lyles if he didn't have Covid, Tebogo rejected the premise.\n\nLykes “was in his best form” this Olympics, Tebogo said. “Hopefully you will recover and then help the team win the gold medal tomorrow in the 4x100 meters.”\n\nHow marriage has shaped Sydney McLaughlin-Levrone\n\nBeing a wife and partner has made Sydney McLaughlin-Levrone a better athlete, she says.\n\nMarriage has changed her life for the better and helped her become stronger on and off the track, the hurdler says.\n\n'One of our favorite stories of these Olympics' — Kristen Faulkner\n\nReporting from Paris\n\nTwo-time gold medalist Kristen Faulkner on her shocking win in the road race and race in the women’s team pursuit and her journey from college athlete to cyclist.\n\nTeam USA's Elle St. Pierre and Nikki Hiltz looking for 1,500m glory\n\nTeam USA's Elle St. Pierre definitively earned her place in the 1,500-meter final, placing a tight third in her semifinal behind Kenya's Faith Kipyegon and Britain's Georgia Bell.\n\nShe will join teammate Nikki Hiltz and medal favorite Kipyegon in Saturday's final.\n\nReplay: A look back at Noah Lyles’ golden 100M race\n\nNoah Lyles was determined to capture gold in both the 100-meter and 200-meter races in Paris. That dream was alive after a photo finish in the 100 meters this week.\n\nHe bested Kishane Thompson of Jamaica by just 0.005 seconds, the fraction of a second leading Lyles to the first-place Olympic finish he was hungry for.\n\nToday, he came in third in the 200-meter event and was taken off the track in a wheelchair. He later revealed that he tested positive for Covid earlier in the week and would miss out on the rest of the Games.\n\nBasketball: Team USA has won a medal in every Olympics it has competed at\n\nReporting from Paris\n\nAfter Team USA staged an epic comeback today against Serbia to advance to the gold medal game Saturday, it is guaranteed to medal.\n\nThe U.S. has won a men’s basketball medal in every Olympics in which it has competed (it boycotted Moscow in 1980), and it is seeking its 17th gold medal in men’s basketball.\n\nIt will play France on Saturday in a rematch of the gold medal game at the Tokyo Olympics. The U.S. won that game 87-82.\n\nSteph Curry delivered a vintage performance against Serbia in the U.S. men’s basketball semifinal today, pouring in a game-high 36 points on 12-of-19 shooting to lead Team USA to a comeback win.\n\nTeam USA swimmer Katie Ledecky and rower Nick Mead will be the U.S. flag bearers for the closing ceremony.\n\nSo just how close are Jordan Chiles and Simone BIles?\n\nWomen’s gymnastics star Jordan Chiles and Team USA teammate Simone Biles are close. How close?\n\n“Simone is like a big sister to me,” Chiles says.\n\nDwyane Wade on the call — with an assist from wife Gabrielle Union\n\nDwyane Wade’s second act is off to a great start.\n\nWade is in Paris working as a men’s basketball analyst for NBC during the Summer Olympics. The three-time NBA champion, who won gold with Team USA in 2008 in Beijing, says his wife, Gabrielle Union, has been providing him with tips to up his game.\n\n“She texts me during halftime. I get to look at my phone and be like, certain things she’s like, ‘Ooh, OK, that was good,’ or ‘Ah, that may be a little problematic.’ I get real-time feedback,” he said today.\n\nBasketball: James says he always knew Curry would come in clutch\n\nReporting from Paris\n\nSerbia proved to be anything but a walkover today for Team USA and its roster full of NBA superstars. It took Steph Curry’s 36-point heroics to keep the game as close as it was before America caught fire late.\n\n“It was only a matter of time before he had one of these games,” said LeBron James. “You could see it every day — he puts too much work in not to have a game like this. We wouldn’t want it any other way, and it was the perfect time for Steph to come out and do what he did.”\n\nNoah Lyles says he is out for the rest of the Paris Games\n\nAfter a third-place finish in the 200-meter race and the announcement that he tested positive for Covid on Tuesday, Lyles said his Paris Olympics are over.\n\n\"I believe this will be the end of my 2024 Olympics,\" he wrote on Instagram. \"It is not the Olympic I dreamed of but it has left me with so much Joy in my heart.\"\n\nHe continued: \"I hope everyone enjoyed the show. Whether you were rooting for me or against me, you have to admit you watched, didn’t you?\" A winky-face emoji was in place at the end of the caption.\n\nLyles was poised to compete in relay teams, namely the 4x100 final, but will now sit that race out. His individual events have been completed.\n\nTeam USA’s 86-kg wrestler Aaron Brooks loses heartbreaker\n\nTeam USA’s 86-kg freestyle wrestler Aaron Brooks lost a heartbreaker of a semifinal in the very last moments to Magomed Ramazanov of Bulgaria.\n\nIOC Safe Sport head files online abuse complaint to Paris authorities\n\nThe Paris prosecutor’s office has confirmed to NBC News that Kirsty Burrows, the head of the IOC’s Safe Sport Unit, filed a complaint Sunday after she got online hate messages. Burrows said she was targeted \"following the press conference she gave as part of her duties in defense of Imane Khelif, the Algerian boxer targeted by a wave of transphobic online hate,\" the Paris prosecutor's office added.\n\nThose responsible for the messages risk sentences of up to five years in prison and a 45,000-euro fine (around $49,000). The IOC did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\nKhelif and fellow boxer Lin Yu‑ting of Taiwan have been at the center of a controversy over gender after it was revealed that they had been disqualified at last year’s Women’s World Boxing Championships by the Russian-led International Boxing Association (IBA) for allegedly failing an unspecified gender test.\n\nThe IOC defended the two female athletes, saying in a statement they had been \"victims of a sudden and arbitrary decision by the IBA\" and \"disqualified without any due process.\" IOC President Thomas Bach also said at a news conference Aug. 1 that \"this is not a transgender issue.\"\n\nKhelif advanced to the women’s welterweight final and will face China’s Yang Liu tomorrow, and Lin Yu-ting will face Poland’s Julia Szeremeta in the women’s featherweight final Saturday.\n\nU.S. star Grant Holloway completed his quest and secured the Olympic crown in the men’s 110-meter hurdles, storming across the line first to win his first gold medal.\n\nBasketball: USA survives scare against Serbia, advances to final\n\nThe U.S. men's basketball team defeated Serbia, 95-91, avoiding an upset in a thrilling semifinal.\n\nFacing its biggest test of the Olympics, Team USA trailed by as much as 17 points. But the Americans gained momentum in the closing stages, taking their first lead with just 4 minutes left, thanks to big shots from Steph Curry, Joel Embiid, Kevin Durant and LeBron James.\n\nCurry led all scorers with 36 points, including two clutch free throws to seal the win in the game's closing moments. James notched the second triple-double of his Olympic career with 16 points, 12 rebounds and 10 assists.\n\nSerbia was led by Bogdan Bogdanović, who scored 20 points. It also received a boost from reigning NBA MVP Nikola Jokić's 17 points and 11 assists.\n\nThe U.S. now advances to the final, taking on France in its quest to win a fifth consecutive gold medal.\n\nI hoped my time would be faster, McLaughlin-Levrone says of world record\n\nReporting from Stade de France, Paris\n\nSydney McLaughlin-Levrone said of her new world record in the 400-meter hurdles that she was \"hoping it was a little faster\" after crossing the finish line.\"I wasn't looking at the clock to be honest with you,\" she told reporters after the race. \"Yeah, I mean, across the line I was definitely grateful for that time.

The silver went to Gabriele Casadei and Carlo Tacchini of Italy, with Spain’s Joan Antoni Moreno and Diego Dominguez winning bronze.\n\nCall them 'Triple Espresso': Star U.S. soccer trio reveals nickname they created for themselves\n\nA shot of \"Triple Espresso\" has been just what the U.S. women’s national soccer team needed to put them within one win of their first Olympic gold medal in 12 years.\n\nStar forwards Trinity Rodman, Mallory Swanson and Sophia Smith have combined for nine of Team USA’s 10 goals during their run to the Olympic final, where they will face Brazil on Saturday.\n\n\"We also have a name for ourselves. We have an announcement,\" Smith told Savannah Guthrie and Hoda Kotb. \"Trinity, take it away.\"\n\n\"We have a proposal for our trio name to be 'Triple Espresso.' So we’re going to put that out into the air and let people run with that, because we like that as well,\" Rodman said.\n\nNo word on whether it has anything to do with one of the songs of the summer, Sabrina Carpenter’s \"Espresso,\" but the trio has provided a jolt of energy and youth to a team that won bronze at the Tokyo Olympics.\n\nRead the full article here\n\nWomen's golf: Nelly Korda back in contention\n\nTeam USA's Nelly Korda has found her form in the second round of the women's golf competition and now finds herself toward the top of the leaderboard.\n\nAfter a dismal round saw the defending gold medalist just about par yesterday, she is tied for second at five under par through 12 holes, three shots behind current leader Morgane Metraux of Switzerland.\n\nWith Korda's fortunes changing course, overnight leader Celine Boutier's hopes have gone the other way. The French golfer carded a brilliant round of seven under yesterday, but a nightmare round of four-over saw her drop down the leaderboard as she returned to the clubhouse.\n\nTeam USA's Lilia Vu has also carded an over-par day. She is now one-under for the tournament and will need a strong performance over the weekend to have any chance of medaling.\n\nLack of wind continues to disrupt sailing\n\nThe men’s kite semifinals have been delayed again because of a lack of wind in Marseille, a familiar problem for anyone following the sailing events this week.\n\nEarlier today, Austrians Lara Vadlau and Lukas Maehr took gold in the mixed dinghy after the medal race was inevitably postponed until wind conditions improved. Okada Keiju and Yoshioka Miho of Japan won silver, and Sweden’s Anton Dahlberg and Lovisa Karlsson won bronze.\n\nIn the mixed multihull event, which was rescheduled from yesterday, Italy’s Ruggero Tita and Caterina Marianna Bantio are back-to-back Olympic champions. Silver went to the Argentine crew of Mateo Majdalani and Eugenia Bosco, while Micah Wilkinson and Erica Dawson of New Zealand won the bronze.\n\nSunny Choi tests out breakdance floor for Olympic debut in Paris\n\nTeam USA athlete Sunny Choi is about to make her big debut in Paris for the first-ever Olympics to feature breaking as a sport and shares a look into how she tests out the space.\n\nWhat do you get as a present for a teenage gold medalist? A pet duck of course!\n\nFourteen-year-old Arisa Trew became Australia's youngest-ever Olympic gold medalist on Wednesday as she wowed crowds, including skating icon Tony Hawk, in taking down the women's skateboard park. The way Trew picked to celebrate her win will quack you up: She asked her parents for a pet duck.\n\n\"My parents promised if I won the gold medal I would get a pet duck,\" the teenage Olympian told Australia's Channel Nine. \"They are really cute. I can take it on walks and take it to the skate park.\"\n\n\"My parents definitely wouldn’t let me get a dog or a cat because we are traveling so much right now. But I feel like a duck might be a little bit easier, and ... I don’t know, I just want a duck.\"\n\nOlympians who finish near the bottom still marvel at what it took to get to Paris\n\nReporting from Paris\n\nEven if Israel Madaye had skewed all of his arrows way off target and scored zero points, the archer from Chad in central Africa wouldn’t have cared.\n\nThough he came last in his event, just getting to the 2024 Paris Games was a colossal achievement. He will always be one of the 10,500 athletes competing here who can call themselves Olympians, able for the rest of their lives to sign the honorific OLY after their names.\n\n“My dream was to qualify for Paris,” said Madaye, 36, who lives in the Chadian capital of N’Djamena. “I always said that even if I scored zero points, I would still be pleased with my achievements because I worked very hard to get here.”\n\nRead the full story here.\n\nWhat is Greco-Roman wrestling?\n\nOne of the oldest sports in the Olympic Games, Greco-Roman wrestling was one of the nine sports featured in the first modern Olympiad in 1896, but what exactly is it and how does it differ from freestyle wrestling?\n\nThe main difference is that, unlike in freestyle, wrestlers are not allowed to grab their opponent below the beltline, so UFC-style grabs for the legs to take down an opponent are off the table and throwing opponents by pulling their upper body is key. Competitors also cannot use their legs against their opponents, either as a part of an offensive move or defensively to block their opponents.\n\nBeyond that, the rules are the same as in freestyle. Wrestlers aim to earn points either by pushing their opponent out of the ring or by taking their opponent down to the mat. Matches consist of two periods of three minutes.\n\nWrestlers can also win instantaneously by pinning their opponent's shoulders to the mat, or by achieving \"technical superiority,\" which means having a lead of 8 points or more (a slight tweak to freestyle wrestling, where this threshold is 10 points). There are two finals later today, both taking place after 1:30 p.m. ET.\n\nLedecky and Mead chosen as U.S. flag bearers for closing ceremony\n\nKatie Ledecky and Nick Mead have been picked as flag bearers to lead the U.S. Olympic team into the closing ceremony on Sunday, after a vote by their fellow Team USA athletes.\n\nFour-time Olympic swimmer Ledecky is the most decorated U.S. women’s Olympian ever, with her four medals at the Paris Games taking her all-time haul to 14. Two-time Olympic rower Mead won gold medal in the men’s four rowing at Paris 2024.\n\n\"Congratulations to our Closing Ceremony flag bearers, Katie Ledecky and Nick Mead, who exemplify the spirit of sport and the pride of Team USA,\" said Sarah Hirshland, CEO of the U.S. Olympic and Paralympic Committee.\n\n\"Katie and Nick have significantly contributed to the joyous and celebratory atmosphere. We are thrilled and proud to follow them into Sunday’s closing festivities,” Hirshland added.\n\nJamaica’s men’s 4x100-meter relay stunningly fails to qualify\n\nJamaica’s men’s 4x100-meter relay stunningly failed to qualify for the Olympic final. The group of Ackeem Blake, Jelani Walker, Jehlani Gordon and Kishane Thompson ran just 38.45 seconds and missed out by .06 seconds after bungling a handover.\n\nSpeed climbing: Team USA's Sam Watson wins bronze as he beats own world record again\n\nSam Watson has claimed bronze in the men's speed climbing, breaking his own world record for a third time in a week in the bronze medal climb.\n\nTexas native Watson narrowly missed out on making the final after being edged out by 0.07 seconds by China's Wu Peng in the semifinals. Peng scaled the wall in 4.85 seconds, a personal best for the Chinese climber, to consign Watson, who had been dominant all week, to the bronze medal climb.\n\nWith Journey's \"Don't Stop Believing\" ringing out across the Le Bourget arena in the very short turnaround between the semifinals and finals, Watson quickly recovered to secure bronze, beating his own world record once again in a time of 4.74 seconds to best Iran's Reza Alipour for the third spot on the podium.\n\nThe final was won by Indonesia's Veddriq Leonardo in 4.75 seconds, scraping out the win against Peng by just 0.02 seconds to secure a sensational gold medal win.\n\nTable tennis: China beats France in men’s team semifinal\n\nHosts France put up a fight but were overcome by China 3-0 in the best-of-five format. Favorites China will now play Sweden in tomorrow’s final, with France playing Japan in the bronze medal match.\n\nChina has won all four Olympic titles in this event since it was introduced at Beijing 2008.\n\nHome favorites Félix Lebrun and older brother Alexis Lebrun were both beaten 3-1 in their respective matches. Bronze medalist Félix saved five match points in a second match full of exciting rallies but was eventually beaten 3-1 by Fan Zhendong.\n\nTeam USA's Sam Watson goes for speed climbing gold after beating own world record\n\nFresh from flying up the speed climbing wall in a staggering 4.75 seconds in qualifying on Tuesday, beating his own world record in the process, Team USA's Sam Watson now has his sights set on Olympic gold.\n\nThe final bracket of the men's speed climbing has just gotten underway at Le Bourget, with 18-year-old Watson through to the semifinals and the favorite to take away gold.\n\nBlockbuster day of basketball: Germany vs. France, Serbia vs. USA\n\nReporting from Paris\n\nMen’s basketball takes center stage this evening in Paris, with NBA standouts on all four squads playing in the semifinals at Bercy Arena.\n\nFirst at 11:30 a.m. ET and 5:30 p.m. local time, host France — with NBA Rookie of the Year Victor Wembanyama — takes on Germany and its Brooklyn Nets point guard Dennis Schröder.\n\nThen in the nightcap at 3:00 p.m. ET and 9:00 p.m. local time, the United States meets Serbia in a contest that includes players who've collectively won nearly a dozen NBA MVP awards — Nikola Jokic (2024, 2022, 2021), Joel Embiid (2023), Steph Curry (2016, 2015), LeBron James (2013, 2012, 2010, 2009) and Kevin Durant (2014).\n\nGermany is a 6-point favorite while bettors like America by about 16.5 points.\n\nTeam USA's men's 4x100-meter progress to final, but are they cursed?\n\nThe history of sports is littered with legendary curses — the Chicago Cubs' 108-year World Series hoodoo, only broken in 2016, is one particularly famous example. This morning, the Team USA men's 4x100-meter relay team made it past the first challenge, winning its heat with ease to progress to tomorrow night’s final. But the bad luck surrounding the team is starting to look like a hex.\n\nSince taking silver in Athens back in 2004, Team USA has failed to win a single Olympic medal in this event, and in the last 20 years, the team has been its own worst enemy, with a litany of mistakes and a doping scandal putting pay to its chances of an Olympic medal.\n\nIn 2008, the baton was dropped during the exchange between Doc Patton and Tyson Gay in the heats. A silver medal for the team in London in 2012 was retracted after Gay returned a positive drug test after the Games. Another botched baton exchange in Rio in 2016 — this time the baton passed outside of the legal area — again saw Team USA disqualified. And it was more of the same in Tokyo, with a bungled exchange between Fred Kerley and Ronnie Baker seeing the team failing to progress to the final.\n\nWhile the team made it to tomorrow's final, it did so without individual 100-meter champion Noah Lyles, rested ahead of tonight's 200-meter final — he will almost certainly come onto the team for tomorrow night. With Jamaica surprisingly failing to qualify, could Team USA be about to end its 20-year drought? Find out at 1:47 p.m. ET tomorrow.\n\nBullied as a kid, she channeled her response into a U.S. Olympic boxing career\n\nU.S. boxer Jennifer Lozano started thinking about how far the sport could take her at 9 years old in Laredo, Texas. When she secured her spot in the 2024 Paris Olympics at October’s Pan American Games, she finally realized a dream years in the making.\n\n“That was surreal. I just couldn’t believe what was right in my hand,” she told NBC News. “Something I was working so hard for. Something I had dreamt of for so long for years since I was a kid and everything I had to go through just to be here.”\n\nBut getting to this point wasn’t easy. Lozano was often teased in school for her weight and her Spanish accent, even though she lived in a city where about 90% of the population speaks Spanish at home. When she sought advice about how to handle bullying, she turned to the person she trusted the most: her grandmother.\n\n“She just told me, ‘Sweetheart, if someone ever hits you, you hit them back. Don’t allow it,’” Lozano said on NBC’s “My New Favorite Olympian” podcast. “I was like, ‘You’re right.’”\n\nRead the full article here\n\nChina calls for increased testing of U.S. track and field athletes\n\nChina’s anti-doping agency called on the International Testing Agency (ITA) to increase testing on U.S. track and field athletes, citing American sprinter Erriyon Knighton’s positive test in March for the steroid trenbolone. Knighton races in the men's 200m final later today.\n\nThe Chinese agency, CHINADA, has raised questions about the U.S. Anti-Doping Agency’s handling of the case, even as the U.S. agency has accused Chinese authorities and the World Anti-Doping Agency of covering up the positive test results of 23 Chinese swimmers ahead of the Tokyo Games.\n\nAs in the case of the Chinese athletes, Knighton’s positive test was attributed to the consumption of contaminated meat, and U.S. officials cleared him to compete in Paris.\n\n\"If trenbolone is indeed a common contaminant in the United States, CHINADA would like to remind athletes from all over the world, including American athletes, to pay close attention to the meat contamination problem in the country when training and competing there,\" the agency said in a statement today.\n\nCiting past U.S. doping scandals and a recent WADA statement that 31% of American athletes were insufficiently tested in the 12-month period before the Tokyo Games, the Chinese agency also said anti-doping supervision of U.S. track and field athletes should be strengthened “in an endeavor to truly protect the legitimate rights and interests of the clean athletes around the world, and to rebuild the trust of global athletes in fair play.”\n\nRead more here about the brewing doping storm between the U.S. and China.\n\nTeam USA cruises to victory in women's 4x100-meter relay heat\n\nTeam USA's women's 4x100-meter squad has cruised to tomorrow night's final after winning their heat well ahead of the rest of the field.\n\nThe squad, consisting of Melissa Jefferson, Twanisha Terry, Sha'Carri Richardson and Gabby Thomas, ran in 41.94 seconds, well ahead of Germany and Switzerland who also qualified for the final.\n\nThe U.S. and Jamaica have dominated this event for the last 15 years, combining to win every world and Olympic title between them since 2009. Jamaica was in the second of the two heats, and came home in third in a time of 42.35 seconds with Great Britain, another medal contender, winning in a time of 42.03 seconds.\n\nTeam USA's Daniela Moroz is a favorite in Olympic kitesurfing\n\nSix-time world kitesurfing champion Daniela Moroz is one of today's favorite to win the kitesurfing competition, one of the newest Olympic sports. For Moroz, kitesurfing is in her blood, thanks to her parents who exposed her to windsurfing at an early age.\n\nAustralian field hockey player apologizes after cocaine arrest\n\nAustralian field hockey player Tom Craig apologized yesterday after being released from custody in Paris, where he was arrested Tuesday for allegedly trying to buy cocaine.\n\n\"I made a terrible mistake. I take full responsibility for my actions,\" Craig, 28, who won silver with the team in Tokyo, told reporters. \"My actions are my own and in no way reflect the values of my family, my teammates, my friends, my sport and the Australian Olympic team. I’ve embarrassed you all. I’m truly sorry.\"\n\nThe Australian Olympic committee said Craig, whose team was knocked out of the Olympics in this week’s quarterfinals, had been released with a warning from a French judge but with no charges or conviction. Chef de mission Anna Meares said Craig would \"lose all his remaining Olympic privileges,\" had already moved out of the Olympic village and would not be attending the closing ceremony.\n\n\"He is a good person who made a bad decision,\" she said in a statement. \"But there are consequences for decisions like this.\"\n\nWomen's golf: Lilia Vu in contention as second round gets underway\n\nTeam USA's Lilia Vu enters the second round of the women's golf tournament in a four-way tie for third, with much of the field struggling on the opening day at Le Golf National.\n\nOnly 12 of the 60-strong field were able to break par during yesterday's opening round, with Vu among them. She sits at two-under-par and has just teed off for her second round.\n\nDefending gold medalist Nelly Korda was one of those who initially struggled yesterday. After bogeying on three of the first seven holes, Korda recovered to finish even-par for the day.\n\nBoth sit behind home favorite Celine Boutier, who stormed to a seven-under round yesterday. She is three shots ahead of second-placed South Africa's Ashleigh Buhai and five ahead of Vu and the trailing pack.\n\nNetherlands wins women's 10km marathon swim to claim first gold of the day\n\nThe Netherlands' Sharon van Rouwendaal has become a two-time Olympic champion, after winning the 10km marathon swim on this sunny Paris morning.\n\nOver two grueling hours in the Seine, van Rouwendaal was able to mount a late pass on Moesha Johnson to claim gold, finishing five seconds ahead of her Australian counterpart.\n\nVan Rouwendaal becomes the first athlete ever to win two Olympic gold medals in marathon swimming, after the event made its debut at the 2008 Beijing Games and she won gold at Rio in 2016. The Dutchwoman also took silver in Tokyo.\n\nItaly's Ginevra Taddeucci claimed bronze to round off the podium.\n\n2024 Paris Olympics Day 13: here’s what to look out for.\n\nGood morning! It’s Day 13 of the 2024 Paris Olympics. Here’s what you should be looking out for today.\n\nIt's another big day for track and field fans, with five more medals on offer.

Sydney McLaughlin-Levrone defends her title in the women's 400m hurdles at 3:25 p.m. ET and 9:25 p.m. local time, before Grant Holloway et al round off the day's track events with men's 110m hurdles at 3:45 p.m. ET and 9:45 p.m. local time.\n\nAmerica's men's basketball team takes on Serbia in the semifinals in its pursuit of a fifth straight gold. The team beat Brazil on Wednesday in a game that saw Kevin Durant becoming the U.S.’s all-time Olympic basketball history top scorer, passing Lisa Leslie. Serbia slipped past Australia in their quarterfinal game and Nicola Jokic and his teammates will be hoping for some Team USA complacency, with the American team winning the two identical matchups in the past month. That game is at 3:00 p.m. ET and 9:00 p.m. local time.\n\nElsewhere, the first ever sailing medals will be awarded for kite surfing, with Markus Edegran and Daniela Moroz competing for the U.S. at 9:40 a.m. ET and 3:40 p.m. local time, and 10:37 am and 4:37 p.m. local time respectively.
