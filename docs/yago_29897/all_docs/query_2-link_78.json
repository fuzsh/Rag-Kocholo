        "text": "Media mogul Rupert Murdoch has tied the knot for the fifth time.\n\nThe 93-year-old former chairman of News Corp and Fox married 67-year-old Elena Zhukova at his California Vineyard over the weekend.\n\nMurdoch began dating Zhukova last year, shortly after his previous engagement to Ann Lesley Smith was called off after just two weeks of being announced.\n\nElena Zhukova, who is a retired molecular biologist, was introduced to Rupert by his ex-wife, Wendi Deng, whom he divorced in 2013 after 14 years of marriage.\n\nThe Sun, which is owned by Murdoch, released photographs of the wedding that show Zhukova wearing a white off-the-shoulder Emilia Wickstead gown and an elegant up-do.\n\nMurdoch wore a black suit, white shirt and soft yellow tie.\n\nIn late 2023, Rupert finally stepped down from leading most of the world’s media, handing the title over to Lachlan Murdoch, his eldest son.\n\nLachlan is one of six Murdoch children. They are, in order of birth, Prudence MacLeod, Elisabeth Murdoch, Lachlan Murdoch, James Murdoch, Grace Murdoch, and Chloe Murdoch.\n\nWho Is Rupert Murdoch’s Fiancee, Elena Zhukova?\n\nElena Zhukova is a retired molecular biologist.\n\nHer daughter, Darya (Dasha) Zhukova, is an art collector who is married to Stavros Niarchos, the Greek shipping heir who dated both Paris Hilton and Mary Kate Olsen.\n\nWho Are Rupert Murdoch’s Ex Wives?\n\nRupert’s wedding to Elena Zhukova is his fifth marriage. His previous wives include:\n\nJerry Hall, 2016 – 2022\n\nMurdoch was married to model and Mick Jagger’s ex Jerry Hall between 2016 and 2022.\n\nWendi Deng, 1999 – 2013\n\nRupert and Wendi were married 14 years. They share two children: Grace, 23, and Chloe, 21.\n\nWendi reportedly introduced Rupert to Elena Zhukova.\n\nAnna Torv, 1967 – 1999\n\nNot to be confused with the Australian actress born in 1979, Anna Torv Murdoch was born in Scotland and was married to Rupert for more than 30 years.\n\nNow 79, Torv is the mother of Elisabeth, Lachlan and James.\n\nPatricia Booker, 1956 – 1967\n\nMelbourne flight attendant and model Patricia Booker was Murdoch’s first wife. The two have a daughter, Prudence."
