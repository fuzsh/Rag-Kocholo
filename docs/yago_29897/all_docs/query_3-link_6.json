        "text": "In all, the founder of News Corp and Fox News has been married five times. His love life, including high-profile marriages to entrepreneur Wendi Deng and model Jerry Hall, has often made headlines throughout his career. His split from his second wife, Anna, has been cited as one of the most expensive divorces in history, with reports claiming she earned a staggering US$1.7 billion in their settlement, though that figure has been called in to question, per The Guardian.\n\nIn 2024, Murdoch and his family are worth almost US$20 billion, according to Forbes.\n\nHere’s a timeline of his marriages – and almost marriages.\n\n1. Patricia Booker\n\nMurdoch married his first wife, Patricia Booker, a former department store model and flight attendant, when he was 25 years old in 1956. He married her against the wishes of his mother, Dame Elisabeth Murdoch, who reportedly regarded Booker as “less than” who she expected her son to marry, Vanity Fair reported.\n\nThe pair had a daughter together, Prudence, now 66, who sits on the board of Times Newspapers, a subsidiary of News Corp, London’s Evening Standard reported.\n\nMurdoch and Booker were married for 11 years before divorcing in 1967.\n\n2. Anna Murdoch Mann\n\nSoon after his divorce from his first wife, Rupert met his soon-to-be second bride, Anna Murdoch Mann.\n\nThey first met when Anna was 18 years old. She had the opportunity to interview Rupert while she worked for the Sydney newspaper, The Daily Telegraph, which he later owned.\n\nThough Rupert’s marriage with Anna was his longest, the couple did have a tumultuous relationship towards the end, as rumours circulated that the media tycoon was having an affair with Deng, who was working as an intern for News Corp.-owned Star TV.\n\nRupert and Anna divorced in 1999.\n\n3. Wendi Deng\n\nThe pair met when Deng was a 29-year-old intern for Star TV, a Hong Kong television station owned by News Corp. They share two daughters, Grace and Chloe.\n\nDeng and Murdoch separated in 2013.\n\n4. Jerry Hall\n\nA week before his 85th birthday in 2016, Murdoch married former supermodel and actress Jerry Hall, then 59.\n\nAfter six years of marriage, Hall filed for divorce from Murdoch in June 2022. But in mid-August of last year, she filed a request in Los Angeles Superior Court to dismiss her original petition for divorce and for permission to file a new one, which was dismissed, the Associated Press reported.\n\nIn a joint statement a day after news reports of Hall’s filing, their representatives announced they had finalised their divorce and “remain good friends and wish each other the best for the future”.\n\n5. Ann Lesley Smith\n\nIn March 2023, Murdoch’s love life was back in the spotlight after he announced he was getting married for the fifth time.\n\nIn an interview with the New York Post, owned by Murdoch’s News Corp., Murdoch said he proposed to his bride-to-be Ann Lesley Smith, then 66, a former model and San Francisco police chaplain, on St Patrick’s Day.\n\n“I was very nervous,” Murdoch told the Post. “I dreaded falling in love – but I knew this would be my last. It better be. I’m happy.”\n\nThe pair first met in September 2022 at his vineyard in Bel Air, California. Two weeks later, Murdoch said he called her.\n\nSmith, who was married to the late country musician Chester Smith, who died in 2008, said, “In perspective, it’s not my first rodeo. Getting near 70 means being in the last half. I waited for the right time. Friends are happy for me.”\n\nMurdoch added, “We’re both looking forward to spending the second half of our lives together.”\n\nBut the engagement was short-lived. They called off the wedding just weeks later in April 2023.\n\n6. Elena Zhukova\n\nWithin a year of calling off his last engagement, Murdoch popped the question to his current partner Zhukova, a retired molecular biologist who was once married to Russian billionaire Alexander Radkin Zhukov.\n\nThe media mogul announced his engagement in March, less than a week shy of his 93rd birthday.\n\nOn June 1, they wed at Murdoch’s luxury estate in California, Moraga Bel Air."
