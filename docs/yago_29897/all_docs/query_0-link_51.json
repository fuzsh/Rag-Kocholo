        "text": "in other news Mar. 19, 2008\n\nThe ‘GQ’ Whipped List Includes Some of New York’s MeekestWe were just tipped off to GQ’s list of “the twenty-five most emasculated, disempowered, henpecked husbands on the planet” by Portfolio’s Jeff Bercovici. He was fascinated by the fact that Wendi Deng, our best friend, pushed Rupert Murdoch around so much. Well, yeah. Doesn’t everyone know that it’s the powerful men who love to be dominated? But what other New York men did GQ out as submissives? Despite the obvious and frankly just-for-show sexism (because everyone knows that all dudes who work for GQ are either gay or Sensitive) we clicked over, and we were not disappointed.\n\nwhite men with money Dec. 7, 2007\n\nChanges in the House of Murdoch! Rebel Son James Anointed News Corp. Heir Apparent James Murdoch, Rupert Murdoch’s not-un-hot, not uncool son, is stepping down from his job at British Sky Broadcasting “to take on a broader role within his father’s media empire,” the Times reports today. The paper daintily suggests that the move indicates Rupert “who is 76” (quoth the Times) has a “plan of succession,” meaning that it’s looking like Harvard dropout James is the one who’s going to take over the role of chairman when dad kicks it. (Alas, poor Lachlan!) This Murdoch the Younger, “who is five years younger than his father’s hot young wife Wendi” (quoth us), will not be coming to New York, however. He’ll remain in Europe, where he’ll take on the titles of chairman and chief executive for Europe and Asia for News Corporation.
