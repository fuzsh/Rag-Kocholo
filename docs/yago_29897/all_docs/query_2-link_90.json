        "text": "Nonagenarian media magnate Rupert Murdoch has married his fifth bride this weekend, with scientist Elena Zhukova joining a long line of Murdoch wives.\n\nThe tycoon, 93, tied the knot with his latest partner at his Bel Air estate in California this weekend, surrounded by family and friends.\n\nMurdoch has been dating Russian molecular biologist Zhukova, 67, for several months now.\n\nThis marks the media mogul’s sixth engagement – coming barely a year after his short-lived engagement to Ann Lesley Smith was broken off in April 2023.\n\nThe pair are said to have met at a party hosted by another of Murdoch’s ex-wives – entrepreneur Wendi Deng.\n\nStruggling to keep track? Don’t worry – we’ve got you covered.\n\nAustralian billionaire Rupert Murdoch began his career in the 1950s, setting his sights on the UK with his purchase of the News of The World and The Sun in 1969.\n\nIn 1996, he compounded an iron grip on the worldwide news by launching Fox News.\n\nIn September, Murdoch handed over the succession of his media empire to his son Lachlan.\n\nWho are Rupert Murdoch’s ex-wives and how many children does he have?\n\nMurdoch has been married four times and has had six children in total.\n\nHis first marriage was to flight attendant Patricia Brooker in 1956. The couple had one child together, Prudence, in 1958.\n\nThey divorced less than ten years later, in 1967.\n\nThe same year as he divorced Patricia, he married journalist and novelist Anna Torv (not to be confused with the actress of the same name).\n\nScottish-born Torv (now Mann) was 13 years Murdoch’s junior – and they had three children together during their marriage; Elisabeth (born 1968), Lachlan (1971) and James (born 1972).\n\nAfter they divorced in 1999, she went on to marry financier William Mann, only six months later.\n\n17 days after his divorce from Mann, Murdoch married entrepreneur and media mogul Wendi Deng – who was 37 years younger than the newsmaker.\n\nDuring their time together, they had two children together: Daughters Grace (born 2001) and Chloe (born 2003).\n\nFollowing their divorce in 2013, Murdoch went on to marry model and actor Jerry Hall in 2016.\n\nThe pair’s marriage ended in 2022 – with her husband said to have broken the news via e-mail.\n\n‘Jerry, sadly I’ve decided to call an end to our marriage,’ his e-mail allegedly went. ‘We have had some good times, but I have much to do… my New York lawyer will be contacting yours immediately.’\n\nIn 2023, he announced his engagement to model Ann Lesley Smith – aged 66 – before backtracking a mere two weeks later.\n\nAccording to reports by Vanity Fair, Murdoch is said to have broken off the engagement after becoming ‘increasingly uncomfortable’ with her ‘outspoken evangelical views.’\n\nHe then went on to meet his new bride Elena Zhukova at another ex-wife’s party. They announced their engagement after dating for several months and were married this weekend.\n\nGot a story?\n\nIf you’ve got a celebrity story, video or pictures get in touch with the Metro.co.uk entertainment team by emailing us celebtips@metro.co.uk, calling 020 3615 2145 or by visiting our Submit Stuff page – we’d love to hear from you.\n\nMORE : Jerry Hall 'banned from giving Succession writers ideas' in Rupert Murdoch divorce"
