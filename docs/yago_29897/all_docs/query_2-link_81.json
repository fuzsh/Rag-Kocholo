        "text": "Hong Kong gossip has it that the first time Wendi Deng met her future husband Rupert Murdoch, she accidentally-on-purpose spilled red wine on his trousers. Recounted by the Australian journalist Eric Ellis, the story is probably apocryphal, but it still captures something important: she is the sort of person other people like to tell stories about – and the more outrageous the better.\n\nDeng is evidently not one to be bound by normal rules. And that is why we may wonder whether even Rupert Murdoch, equipped as he is with a steel-trap mind, not to mention the best prenuptial advice money can buy, may not have ventured out of his depth. Although conventional wisdom has it that the divorce will proceed smoothly and without undue strain, an analysis of the circumstantial evidence suggests otherwise.\n\nAccused of social climbing, gold-digging, and even sleeping her way to the top, Deng has now suddenly seen her name linked with everyone from Google boss Eric Schmidt to former British Prime Minister Tony Blair (the latter surely an absolute absurdity). What seems certain is that if fortune favors the bold, few women have ever more studiedly embodied that principle.\n\nAn unshakeable self-confidence seems to be key. When, in her mid twenties, she began work in Hong Kong as a lowly gofer for an English-language television station, for instance, she immediately developed unorthodox techniques for making an impression. In ensuring that everyone knew who she was, she used to waltz in unannounced on senior executives. As recounted by Ellis, a particularly memorable episode concerned Robert Bland, a pony-tailed Australian, who as head of the station’s successful advertising sales department was probably not one to be trifled with. Having made his acquaintance the previous day, she spotted him walking down a corridor. In full view of several colleagues, she snuck up behind him and yanked his ponytail. For a split second the surprised Antipodean was beside himself with apoplexy. As he swung round, Deng chirped, “I’m Wendi! Remember me? I’m the intern. Ha, ha, ha!” Bland’s demeanor instantly morphed from thunder to sunshine.\n\nBorn in Jinan in Eastern China at the height of Mao’s Cultural Revolution, Deng embarked on her rocket ride to the global plutocracy when, aged just eighteen, she met an expatriate American couple Jake and Joyce Cherry. Joyce taught Deng English and was eventually to help get her into California State University. In the meantime Deng started an affair with Jake, an engineer who had been briefly assigned to advise a Chinese manufacturing company. The Cherrys, having returned to California, took Deng into their home. Joyce eventually discovered the affair and kicked them out. Jake soon married Deng and they remained married just long enough for her to secure a green card. Within months of the wedding, however, Deng had started an affair with a younger man. After a spell at Yale she established herself in television in Hong Kong, where she met Murdoch (who owned the television company).\n\nA fundamental problem for Rupert Murdoch as he embarks on this divorce is a clash of cultures. Thinking in Western terms, he and his lawyers may imagine that what the prenuptial contract says goes. This is not how things work in the East. As decades of American interaction with East Asian businesses have consistently shown, contracts mean nothing. What matters is power. Those who have it dictate the terms.\n\nA further cultural point is also relevant. It is considered fair game in East Asia for people to pry into their spouses’ lives – and this goes even in happy marriages. In extreme cases prying might involve audio and even video recording. Of course, spying on one’s spouse is not limited to East Asia but the difference is that in East Asia there is no obloquy: basically Murdoch may have imagined the encounter was being playing by Queensberry rules when in reality this is kick-boxing.\n\nThe current face-off cannot be understood without considering the history. It seems clear that Murdoch learned the full details of Deng’s “controversial” past only after he married her, and then only from reading an account in the Wall Street Journal in 2000 (long before the paper was purchased by his News Corporation in 2007). The next key event seems to have been a television interview in 2006 in which he announced that the two daughters he had with Deng would not inherit the same voting rights in the Murdoch empire as the four children from his earlier marriages. His decision seems to have been influenced by her past – and it seems to have gone a long way towards the final breakdown of the marriage.\n\nIf this inference is correct (and all the circumstantial evidence from various people who know the couple suggests it is), Deng has had many years to prepare for this moment. She must moreover be counted a particularly determined opponent.\n\nThe main issue here would appear to be equal treatment for her children in the Murdoch empire's unusual voting structure (it seems they will be treated equally in purely financial terms). If they get equal voting rights and Murdoch passes on before they reach majority, Deng would presumably vote on their behalf -- and would wield almost one-third of the entire Murdoch family's votes. Given that Murdoch's four children from his previous marriages do not always pull together, the implication is that she would end up, for a time at least, controlling one of the world's most powerful media empires.\n\nPerhaps the strangest thing about this episode is the timing. There is for a start the fact that remarkably few men in their eighties, irrespective of the state of their marriages (or their bank balances), sue for divorce. There is also the fact that Murdoch has spent the last two years in an exhausting effort to steer News Corporation through the British phone hacking affair. He has still not fully recovered from what probably counts as the most stressful episode in his entire life and has not completed the proposed restructuring of the company.\n\nThe circumstances suggest a particularly unpleasant breach – and one in which to say the least the ambitious adventuress from Jinan has hitherto stood her ground."
