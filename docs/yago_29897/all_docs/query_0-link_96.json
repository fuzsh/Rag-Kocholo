        "text": "News Corp. boss Rupert Murdoch has filed for divorce from his wife of 14 years, Wendi Deng, The Associated Press reports. The media mogul claimed \"the relationship between the husband and wife has broken down irretrievably\" in the filing with the New York State Supreme Court, according to the AP.\n\nLet's hope the outcome isn't as grisly as a 2006 episode of Law & Order: Criminal Intent that seems to have been modeled on Murdoch and Deng; it centered around a radio magnate (Malcolm McDowell) whose Chinese-born wife (Cindy Cheung) was the focus of the investigation into his son's murder.\n\nCheck out the most shocking celebrity splits\n\nMurdoch, 82, and Deng, 44, have two daughters — Grace, 11, and Chloe, 9. Murdoch also has four grown children from previous marriages. Three of them — Elisabeth, James and Lachlan — have active roles within News Corp., and all four have equal votes in electing trustees.\n\nThe couple met in 1997 and were married in 1999. Deng became the focus of media attention in 2011 when, during a hearing about the News Corp. phone hacking scandal, she smacked a protester who had thrown a pie at Murdoch."
