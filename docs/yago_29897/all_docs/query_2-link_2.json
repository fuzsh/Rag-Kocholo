        "text": "During their 14 years of marriage, Rupert Murdoch and Wendi Deng welcomed two daughters, Grace, 11, and Chloe, 9.\n\nIn the wake of the divorce, Murdoch and Deng have been reported to have filed for joint custody of their kids.\n\nPHOTOS: Rupert Murdoch’s Family Photos\n\nHere are four things to know about the girls:\n\n1. They have non-voting shares in News Corp., unlike his other children.\n\nIn 2006, Murdoch stated in an interview with Charlie Rose that his youngest children, Grace and Chloe, would have equal economic interest in the family’s trust, but wouldn’t get voting power in News Corp. like Rupert’s other children; Wendi learned about this from TV and threatened to leave him, The New York Times reported. Deng and her two children have 8.73 million shares of class A non-voting shares of News Corp. stock, according to a report.\n\n2. Murdoch worried about private schools.\n\nDuring an interview with Vanity Fair in 2008, Murdoch said he worried about getting Grace into a New York private school and wanted her to attend Brearley, where his second-oldest daughter, Elisabeth, went. The media mogul recruited one of his executives to contact Caroline Kennedy, a Brearley alumna and board member, to get her to write a letter on Grace’s behalf. Both Grace and Chloe are fluent in English and Mandarin.\n\nPHOTOS: Rupert Murdoch and Wendi Deng Through the Years\n\n3. They have famous godparents.\n\nTony Blair, who is godfather to Grace, attended the two girls’ baptism beside the River Jordan in 2011. Also in attendance were Nicole Kidman and Hugh Jackman, who became their godparents in 2010. After the baptism, Queen Rania of Jordan invited the Murdochs, Kidman, Jackman, Kidman’s husband, Keith Urban, and Ivanka Trump for a three-day tour of the country, including a visit to Petra, Wadi Rum and the Dead Sea.\n\n4. A nanny claimed they have an uncensored home life."
