        "text": "Wendi Deng, the wife of the media mogul Rupert Murdoch, and Anna Murdoch Mann, his former wife, have a seemingly cordial relationship.\n\nThey see each other at family gatherings, like the weddings of Anna and Rupert's three adult children, and the christening of grandchildren, people who are close to the family say. Rupert Murdoch's two young children with Ms. Deng, his third wife, play frequently with the grandchildren he shares with Anna Mann, his second wife, who has remarried.\n\nBut despite these family get-togethers, an underlying tension is growing over eventual control of the News Corporation, the globe-spanning media company that Mr. Murdoch has built over four decades, with Ms. Deng and Mrs. Mann playing crucial roles.\n\nA simmering debate over the trust that owns the family's 28.5 percent voting stake in the News Corporation surfaced with the resignation last week of Lachlan, Mr. Murdoch and Mrs. Mann's elder son, from his job at the News Corporation, where he was seen as a potential successor to his father.\n\nThe precipitating reason for Lachlan's departure, he has told several people, was his father's undermining of his position within the company over a long period.\n\nPeople close to both father and son have also acknowledged, however, that tensions over the trust were a factor, and those tensions stem from the conflicting maternal ambitions of Ms. Deng and Mrs. Mann.\n\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.
