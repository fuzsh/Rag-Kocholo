        "text": "AFP June 14, 2013, 2:07 pm\n\nNEW YORK (AFP) - News Corp chief Rupert Murdoch filed papers to divorce his third wife Wendi Deng, citing an \"irretrievably\" broken marriage to a woman 38 years his junior.\n\nThe 82-year-old media tycoon's Chinese-born partner is perhaps best known for a 2011 incident when she leapt to defend her husband by striking a pie-wielding protester, prompting headlines calling her a \"tiger wife\".\n\n\"I can confirm for the record that Rupert filed in New York State Supreme Court this morning for divorce,\" his spokesman Steven Rubenstein told AFP on Thursday.\n\n\"The line from the filing says 'the relationship between Mr Murdoch and Wendi has broken down irretrievably.'\"\n\nA source close to News Corp said the couple had a pre-nuptial agreement but did not elaborate.\n\nThe divorce will not affect the way in which the media empire is run as Deng does not have stock or voting rights in News Corp, the source said on condition of anonymity.\n\nMurdoch's four oldest children, who are from previous marriages, have voting rights, the source said.\n\nNews of the impending divorce was not seen as a sign of problems at the company, and shares in News Corp rose 2.39 percent Thursday to close at $31.68.\n\nDeng, 44, married Murdoch in 1999 aboard a private yacht that he had reportedly bought for his retirement. They have two daughters, Grace and Chloe.\n\nThe news comes two days after News Corp shareholders approved a plan to split the Murdoch-led conglomerate into two independent firms on June 28.\n\nThe corporate split, described as a way to \"unlock value\" at the huge conglomerate, will create one company focusing on news and publishing another concentrating on television and film.\n\nMurdoch will remain in charge of both firms after the split, as chairman and chief executive of the entertainment-focused 21st Century Fox, and executive chairman of the new News Corporation, the publishing unit.\n\nDeng met Murdoch while working at his Star Television company in Hong Kong, where former colleagues have described her as an expert networker with big ambitions.\n\nBorn in the eastern Chinese city of Xuzhou in 1968 -- at the height of the Cultural Revolution -- she left China at 19 to study in the United States. She graduated from the Yale School of Management in 1996.\n\nMurdoch has spent a lifetime building his News Corp empire from a single Australian newspaper he inherited.\n\nHe moved to London where his purchase of the weekly News of the World in 1969 gave him a high-profile foothold in the British market. He went on to buy The Sun, a daily which he turned into a popular and big-selling tabloid.\n\nThe success of his London-based newspapers helped finance his 1981 purchase of The Times and Sunday Times, both prestigious broadsheets, in an acquisition that met with intense opposition from parts of Britain's establishment.\n\nHe relocated to the United States where more bold acquisitions followed and where he became a naturalized US citizen in 1985.\n\nThe conglomerate made a string of high-profile acquisitions, including the Fox broadcast and Hollywood studios, and The Wall Street Journal.\n\nHis youngest son James, 40, is believed to be the heir apparent to the family empire.\n\nJames oversaw the closure of the 168-year-old News of The World tabloid, which folded on July 9 after the revelation the tabloid hacked into the phones of a murdered teenager and the families of dead soldiers.\n\nJames was named News Corp's deputy chief operating officer in March 2011 and serves as chief executive of the news and entertainment giant's international operations.\n\nIn 1998, Murdoch and his second wife, Anna, separated after 32 years of marriage. She then filed for divorce in California courts.\n\nThe three Murdoch children from his second marriage -- Elizabeth, Lachlan and James -- have worked for the company or served on the board of directors.\n\nMurdoch previously was married to Patricia Booker, an Australian flight attendant, with whom he had one daughter.\n\nWendi Deng and Rupert Murdoch could split property empire\n\nAs he files for divorce, the News Corp boss stands to lose some of their multimillion-dollar portfolio of homes around the globe\n\nLisa O'Carroll\n\nThe Guardian, Friday 14 June 2013 14.39 BST\n\nRupert could lose some of the multimillion-dollar portfolio of homes he owns around the world. Photograph: Phil McCarten/Reuters\n\nWhen they quit their loft apartment in New York's bohemian SoHo for the conservative Upper East Side in 2005, it was a wrench for Wendi Deng but a return home for Rupert Murdoch.\n\nIn a rare interview designed to help sell the SoHo property, the differences, perhaps caused by their 38-year age difference, were there to see. At 36, Deng loved the vibrant and arty atmosphere of lower Manhattan and talked of all the friends her daughters had made. \"I love downtown. It is casual and my children have all kinds of friends here,\" she told the New York Times.\n\nMurdoch, on the other hand, said he definitely had no interest in holding on the apartment and was keen to move to the $44m penthouse triplex once home to billionaire Laurance Rockefeller overlooking Central Park. The SoHo apartment sold for less than the asking price at $25m in 2005, more than tripling the $7.4m purchase price.\n\nMurdoch lived in the same Upper East Side block when married to his second wife, Anna Torv, and had his eye on the trophy triplex for decades. \"It was your American dream,\" said Deng, as Rupert explained how he had once told Rockefeller he would buy the Fifth Avenue apartment if he could ever afford it.\n\nIt is one of seven residences around the world that Murdoch is thought to own, which are now expected to feature in the settlement after the News Corporation founder filed for divorce on Thursday.\n\nFifth Avenue, New York\n\nThis majestic 20-room top-floor apartment at 834 Fifth Avenue boasts 4,000 sq ft of space over three floors, each with its own terrace overlooking Central Park zoo. Described as the \"most pedigreed building on the snobbiest street in the more real-estate-obsessed city\" in the world, Deng reportedly spent £5m refurbishing the home and creating a £300,000 gym. When Murdoch bought it in 2005, the $44m he paid made it the most expensive apartment in New York, although this has since been eclipsed.\n\nMoraga Vineyard, Los Angeles\n\nThis 16-acre estate in the Moraga Canyon in upscale Bel Air, California, once played host to Hollywood stars including Clark Gable, Vivian Leigh and Spencer Tracy.\n\nMurdoch bought the house in May 2013 after spotting an advert in his Wall Street Journal for the property advertised at $29.5m. \"About to celebrate buying beautiful small vineyard right in LA. Great wine, Moraga, owned by great Angelino Tom Jones. Time cover, 1961!\", he tweeted in May.\n\nRosehearty, Oyster Bay, New York State\n\nBought in 2003, this £10m beachside home is a jewel on the Centre Island shoreline. It was sometimes rented out, but not just to anybody. Angelina Jolie took it for $100,000 a month during the filming of Salt. The house boasts 11 bedrooms and seven bathrooms, plus a 50-foot pool, large garage, tennis court and a 950-square-foot guest house on the 4.6-acre grounds. It was on the market for $14.8m in September 2011, but it is not known if it was actually sold.\n\nBeverly Hills, Los Angeles\n\nThis 11-bed and nine-bathroom semi-circular villa in Beverly Hills is on an 8,700 sq ft plot tucked away in the hills, far from prying eyes.\n\nMayfair, London\n\nThis luxury apartment in St James, Mayfair, central London, was remodelled by Deng in a modern Chinese minimalist style. Murdoch has frequently assembled some of London's elite at the flat, with dinner guests in the past year including George Osborne, Boris Johnson and homeland actor Damian Lewis.\n\nCruden Farm, Victoria\n\nThe 54-hectare Murdoch family estate in Langwarrin south of Melbourne, Australia, features magnificent gardens complete with ponds, lemon-scented gum trees and two walled gardens and perennial borders. Given to Murdoch's mother as a wedding present by Keith Murdoch in 1928, this is likely to have been left to the media mogul and his surviving siblings when his 103-year-old mother Elisabeth died in December.\n\nCavan, Australia\n\nCavan, is a large farm, or grazier, in Yass in Australia and was one of the first of a number of luxurious residences Murdoch would establish in his 70-year career. Like Cruden, has magnificent gardens which are sometimes open to the public.\n\nBeijing\n\nIn 2004, the couple reportedly paid $5m for a siheyuan, a rare traditional courtyard-style building on the fringes of the Chinese capital's Forbidden City."
