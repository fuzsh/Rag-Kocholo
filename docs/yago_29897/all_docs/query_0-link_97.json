        "text": "Rupert Murdoch, the chairman of News Corp and 21st Century Fox, and his third wife Wendi Deng have agreed the terms of their divorce settlement.\n\nThe couple appeared in the New York Supreme Court in Manhattan to put the final touches on the agreement to end their 14-year marriage.\n\nAs part of the deal, Ms Deng will keep the couple's apartment on Fifth Avenue in Manhattan valued at $44 million and their home in Beijing.\n\nOther details of the deal have been kept secret.\n\nIn a 10-minute hearing, the couple were told by the judge that she was pleased they had resolved matters amicably.\n\nMs Deng gave her soon-to-be ex-husband a hug after the proceedings finished.\n\nMurdoch, 82, and Deng, 44, who were married in 1999, issued a statement after attending the hearing before New York judge Ellen Gesmer.\n\n\"We are pleased to announce that we have reached an amicable settlement of all matters relating to our divorce,\" the statement said.\n\n\"We move forward with mutual respect and a shared interest in the health and happiness of our two daughters. We will not comment on this any further.\"\n\nThe couple has 60 days to implement the settlement before the divorce is final, US media reports said.\n\nMr Murdoch filed for divorce from Ms Deng in June, seeking to end a marriage that had irretrievably broken down, according to his spokesman.\n\nHe made the move weeks before he was set to split his media and entertainment empire into two separate companies: News Corp, for print media, and 21st Century Fox for television and cinema.\n\nThe couple had signed a pre-nuptial agreement ensuring that Murdoch's grip on his media empire would not be affected by any possible break-up.\n\nDeng does not hold a stake in the family trust that controls the two companies.\n\nTheir two children, Grace Helen, 12, and Chloe, 10, have stakes in the trust but they do not hold voting rights.\n\nMr Murdoch also has four grown children: Prudence from his first marriage, and Lachlan, James and Elisabeth from his second.\n\nThese four grown children all have voting rights in the trust that holds about 40 per cent of the voting stock in News Corp and Fox.\n\nMurdoch, whose fortune is estimated by Forbes at around $13.4 billion, owns some of the most famous newspaper titles in the world, including The Wall Street Journal, The New York Post and British dailies The Times and The Sun.\n\nHis British newspaper arm was embroiled in a phone-hacking scandal which erupted in 2011, ultimately leading to the closure of Sunday tabloid The News of the World.\n\nDeng met Murdoch while she worked at his Star Television company in Hong Kong, where former colleagues have described her as an expert networker with big ambitions.\n\nBorn in the eastern Chinese city of Xuzhou in 1968 - at the height of the Cultural Revolution - she left China at 19 to study in the United States. She graduated from the Yale School of Management in 1996.\n\nLast year, she famously leapt out of her seat to counter-attack a protester who hit Murdoch with a cream pie during testimony before a British parliamentary committee over the hacking of voice mails by his now-defunct News of the World tabloid."
