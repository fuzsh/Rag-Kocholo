        "text": "[quote] An old school courtesan. Learn from your betters,children. She is good.\n\nShe made a big mistake, though, \"marrying\" Mick Jagger in a foreign country. I'm sure she learned from that. Her marriage to Murdoch probably happened in a US court of law.\n\nR12, If she signed an iron-clad prenup, then she's not getting anywhere near $500 million unless he chooses to give it to her. Murdoch has the best lawyers in the world and there's no way that Jerry is beating the prenup.\n\nIf prenups were that easily broken, especially ones written by the best lawyers in the world, then why have them at all? No rich person would ever get married again.\n\n[quote] Some prenups provide for an increased payout if the marriage lasts longer than, for example, five years. Perhaps she maxed out the amount that she could collect, and likely wouldnâ€™t get any more when he died. Actually, now that I think about it, collecting under a prenup might be better than inheriting pursuant to a will or trust, since the children might fight her.\n\nI'm guessing this is the nature of their prenup. The marriage has lasted a decent length, i.e., her payout is maxed out. He's still of sound mind (competent). She won't have to deal with his children.\n\nHe's been divorced 3X prior, so it's probably minimal drama.\n\nShe's still reasonably young. She can enjoy her money, travel, plus she has kids and maybe grandchildren.\n\nJerry probably was fooling around on the old asshole and she thought he'd be dead by now. With the Dominion lawsuit looming and the entirely possible outcome that they'll break Murdoch, time to get out now, take the money and run.\n\nI think she only married him because she was still so pissed off at Mick who was a total scumbag to her. When Jerry married Murdoch in London, ALL Mick's kids - not just the ones he fathered with Jerry, showed up at the wedding. Apparently, Jerry is very loveable.\n\nr83 is right - $20 to $40 million or so plus all her jewelry and gifts. If he bought her a ranch recently, in TX, that may be hers to keep as well - a parting gift.\n\nThey were together enough a year ago to host her youngest son's wedding at their shared UK estate. I wonder what happened here. Unlike most in this thread, I don't believe Jerry married him strictly for the money. She's always been a deep romantic at heart - it's what kept her tied to stingy lying Mick for so long - and a deeply committed family person. I think she wanted this - her only legal marriage - to last until death.\n\nWhat r87 said.\n\nSomeone upthread got me thinking about sparing herself a fight with his children.\n\nMaybe, and I know this is may be laughable, but just maybe, this is an amicable, mutual decision to spare everybody a post-death kerfluffle.\n\nHe can cut Hall loose with generous parting gift$. She gets to enjoy those. Done.\n\nHe has 6 children, I believe. 2 with Deng, 3 with the 1st wife and a daughter with the 2nd. He probably just everything in order for them.\n\nI recall reading that as part of the settlement with Deng, he agreed to increase the percentage of cash and stock that his daughters with Deng would get to the same rate as his other children, something his other children weren't happy about.\n\nI read in that Vanity Fair piece about the divorce that his children HATED Deng.\n\n[quote]The marriage has lasted a decent length, i.e., her payout is maxed out. He's still of sound mind (competent). [bold]She won't have to deal with his children.[/bold]\n\nAgreed, divorcing now will save everyone a headache down the line.\n\n[quote]With the Dominion lawsuit looming and the entirely possible outcome that they'll break Murdoch, time to get out now, take the money and run.\n\nI'm surprised R73 is the only one to mention this, especially with this news being reported yesterday (6/21/2022).\n\nIt's not the Dominion suit. That doesn't have a snowball's chance in hell of seriously damaging Murdoch pere et fils. The judge has already let Fox News itself off the hook. This ruling is simply that the complaint has made enough of an initial showing to go forward. There isn't going to be substantive proof against the Murdochs as individuals. And if there was, they won't be facing crippling losses over this.\n\nIt's something else. Agreed with the posters above that something happened. Here's hoping we find out what it is--the whole thing is very odd. NYT reported that Murdoch's people were very surprised to hear of it.\n\nR135, they met in Australia or through an Australia connection. Jerry played Mrs. Robinson in at least one production of \"The Graduate\" there, and was due for a return engagement. Supposedly she met Rupert's sister or some female relative of his there, at a dinner or event, and that relative played matchmaker. When the two of them got engaged he got her out of the contract to do her return in the play.\n\nHer Australia connection goes back a little ways. While there for one of her earlier \"Graduate\" stints, she met a wealthy widower who was a developer or real estate mogul or something. He was much younger than Rupert and nice-looking. That was a serious relationship for several years, about 15 years ago. Didn't last.\n\nI agree with r116. After a certain age, a wealthy and powerful man does not want to appear in public in a diminished state, not only due to vanity, but to avoid speculation from shareholders, the media, public, etc.\n\nMy take on it is that he has a form of dementia. He's only known Jerry for six years or so, it's not a life long relationship. Maybe he's forgotten that he married her or who she is entirely and refuses to belief she's his wife? At 96, it's not hard to believe he's become addled and agitated and that he demanded the \"stranger\" be gone. Even if she lived in a different residence, what would be the point of remaining married, especially if he can't really be out in public lest people catch wind of a mental decline.\n\nDM followup today reports Rupert's \"summer party\" at London's Serpentine Gallery earlier this week was notable for the absence of Jerry or any of her family/friends. (It was also noted he spent 15 minutes talking to Boris Johnson.) But NYT or one of the earlier reports said she was \"doting on him\" at his 90th birthday party at Tavern on the Green late last August 2021.\n\nCould politics finally have come between them? When they got engaged someone was quoted as saying he was conservative while Jerry hated Trump, but they were okay with their differences. But one of Hall's daughters is a progressive firebrand and ERA activist, and Jerry has appeared in photo PR with her. Wonder if divisions widened along with the widening ideological divisions in the culture and his media holdings . . .\n\nSeems to be Aussie outlet showbiz411 reporting that rumored estimates have Jerry getting under $10 million at an estimated $1 million a year per any prenup. That seems low. The DM and others breathlessly throwing around high-stakes figures are ludicrously high and overblown, but under $10 million // $1 million yearly isn't credible either.\n\nshowbiz411 is also the outlet claiming Jerry would smoke around Murdoch and blow smoke in his face. Really? Yes, it's clear she remained a smoker, but insisting on smoking up close to him when he didn't like it and he's 90 years old? That also seems hard to believe.\n\n[quote]I actually am a little surprised. They're both old, why bother to divorce at this point? What is the financial incentive on his side and hers? That's all it can be, right?\n\nI have no idea, but I like to imagine some Succession-type scenario where she held some Marcia-like control over the old fuck & his kids somehow managed to undermine her with him and being who he is, he cut her off without another word. This settlement is her big payout to go quietly before he pops his clogs & shit really get crazy.\n\n[quote] Could politics finally have come between them? When they got engaged someone was quoted as saying he was conservative while Jerry hated Trump, but they were okay with their differences. But one of Hall's daughters is a progressive firebrand and ERA activist, and Jerry has appeared in photo PR with her.\n\nIMO, stop trying to imagine that JH is a better person than she appears to be. She knew who he was when she married him. Same with Melania.\n\n[quote]I'd rather be poor than married to an evil corpse like Murdoch.\n\nThis is a tough one; he may be evil, but wildly rich. Hall will likely never want for anything for the rest of her life.\n\nAside from the whole \"good looks\" thing, I lack the ability to keep my mouth shut & my opinions to myself, so I'd never make it as some rich evil person's spouse because I'd feel the need to tell them what an asshole they are. The ability to be a good concubine is not a job for the weak in spirit\n\nR182, it's dubious that Jerry Hall left Murdoch. It's highly likely it is Rupert issuing her with walking papers. One can only hope the tea spills. But that Friedman guy at showbiz411 claims that all the Murdoch-owned news outlets are burying any news. So, it's basically the NYT, who won't get into the real dirt, plus, the DM and its spinoffs like inews.co.uk, or any other outlet not owned or dependent on the Murdoch conglomerate.\n\nPerhaps lockdown and isolation brought out cracks that wouldn't have cracked otherwise. Another thought is, when they got engaged and in the initial year or two, the word was that Rupert was enjoying life. But then the MeToo avalanche hit Fox, with Rupert losing Roger Ailes and facing a collapse there, etc. And the next thing you knew, news reports were saying Rupert had resumed day-to-day involvement and oversight of Fox.\n\nAnd it basically hasn't stopped since, with Rupert being highly engaged again with all kinds of bazillionaire-pulling-puppet-strings stuff. The whole sale to Disney, the Sky News thing that he lost, one thing after another. Maybe it's not what Jerry Hall understood the plan to be when they married, and there were tensions. But like the scorpion, Rupert is just behaving true to his nature. He may have been feeling lonely post-Wendi Deng, and thought he wanted to enjoy life with a fun gal like Jerry. But this guy was never gonna sit back and enjoy the fun his money could bring him on a sustained basis. He was never gonna be able to contain himself from a day-to-day existence composed of pulling puppet string, micromanaging, making more deals, etc.\n\nShe doesn't seem like the sort interested in Rupert's business or his politics. Nor does she seem interested in billions; a hundred million or so will do. Which is to say she was no threat to his children.\n\nBut she does seem the sort who deeply needs not just romance and affection, but the hard love of a man in her life. Like Wendy, she probably had to find what she needed elsewhere, perhaps even with Mick again. And that for Rupert would be crossing a red line with no chance of redemption. Just like Wendy. The personal insult would be too great.\n\nFrom the article at R194 .\n\n\"Are we witnessing an old man with a Â£14 billion fortune getting his complex family affairs in order like some sort of Succession season finale? \"\n\nIt's an interesting thought. Perhaps he's gotten his final diagnosis and IS getting his affairs in order. I mean, Jerry was great to have on his arm for a few years, but there's no way she's getting a big cut of the inheritance.\n\n[quote]It's an interesting thought. Perhaps he's gotten his final diagnosis and IS getting his affairs in order.\n\nMeh, nothing short of a wooden stake through the heart will end it for that old ghoul. I tend to think he was sick of her for some reason. If he was dying, he seems like the type that would want someone like her around to tend to his every whims and the kids sort out the details when he's dead.\n\nR211. I had forgotten they bought Great Tew. The stories about the house are all the same: that it was abandoned and falling apart by 1800. They ignore the obvious architectural evidence that it was bought in the mid-19th Century, improved and enlarged and lived in by that family until 1914 before being sold again. The iron balustered stair shown in several photos, for instance, is from that mid-19thC period. Clearly it was occupied up to WWI and beyond that if the clippings and letters and Schweppes bottles and other bits were found in the house. It was a dangerous mess, and I'm not sure how much of the house represented its early history or its early history renovated multiple times.\n\nThere are better houses to sink a reported Â£30M into buying (plus renovations), but I hope the work on it hasn't stopped dead.\n\nNothing is beyond repair if you want to repair it, and large sections of this house are not ruinous. This is a big job, but hardly an insurmountable one.\n\nThe house seems to be listed as a Grade II historic building, England having Grade I (highest level of significance), Grade II* (intermediate), and Grade II (lowest and by far the most common listing grade.) Original details of significance cannot be removed or altered without approval. Usually a buildings listing will apply to the exterior and to any catalogued interior elements.\n\n[quote]They were such a bizarre couple, I always kind of hoped they would make it.\n\nAs awful as Murdoch is, you'd think if there was anyone that could appeal to his better nature (assuming he had one), it'd be Jerry. But this split exposes the relationship as what people always figured it was: completely transactional.\n\nRomance is well & truly dead! Next we'll learn that the Clooney marriage is a sham!\n\nThe two apartments Murdoch is still trying to sell at One Madison (22 E. 22nd St.) are disappointing in everything but views and price.\n\nLink to all properties currently for sale in building. Murdoch's are the first two, the PH at $58M (6850sf) and 57A at $16M (3310sf). The view of the MetLife tower and an almost square on view of the Empire State and then the skyscrapers and rivers beyond are impressive, but not among the best. And the architecture is just disappointing, the airport lounge of a better airline...albeit in the sky. It's generically corporate and short of the quality of finish that one might want for splashing around $60M. And somehow it all seems a little tight and underwhelming; for something approach 7000sf, it has airiness in the double-height space, but not a sense of spaciousness. Even the expanse of the partially double-height Great Room and Dining Room with something around 1450sf is chopped in half by an elevator and spiral stair that might have been a nice sculptural element but it's tucked away in shadows.\n\nI would take half of Wendi Deng's divorce settlement apartment for both of these apartments at One Madison."
