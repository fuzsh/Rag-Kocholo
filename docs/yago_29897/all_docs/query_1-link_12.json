        "text": "Rupert Murdoch married Elena Zhukova, a 67-year-old retired biologist, this weekend.\n\nThe billionaire former News Corp. chairman announced their engagement in March.\n\nHis former wives include entrepreneur Wendi Deng and model Jerry Hall.\n\nBillionaire media mogul Rupert Murdoch married his fifth wife, Elena Zhukova, at his Moraga Vineyards in California this weekend.\n\nMurdoch, 93, had announced his engagement to the 67-year-old retired molecular biologist in March, less than a year after he called off his last engagement, to Ann Lesley Smith, a former model and police chaplain.\n\nIn all, the founder of News Corp. and Fox News been married five times.\n\nHis love life, including high-profile marriages to entrepreneur Wendi Deng and model Jerry Hall, has often made headlines throughout his career. His split from his second wife, Anna, has been cited as one of the most expensive divorces in history, with reports claiming she earned a staggering $1.7 billion in their divorce settlement, though that figure has been called in to question, per The Guardian. In 2024, Murdoch and his family are worth almost $20 billion, according to Forbes.\n\nHere's a timeline of his marriages.\n\nPatricia Booker\n\nMurdoch married his first wife, Patricia Booker, a former department store model and flight attendant when he was 25 years old in 1956. He married her against the wishes of his mother, Dame Elisabeth Murdoch, who reportedly regarded Booker as \"less than\" who she expected her son to marry, Vanity Fair reported.\n\nThe pair had a daughter together, Prudence, now 66, who sits on the board of Times Newspapers, a subsidiary of News Corp, London's Evening Standard reported.\n\nMurdoch and Booker were married for 11 years before divorcing in 1967.\n\nAnna Murdoch Mann\n\nShortly after his divorce from his first wife, Murdoch met his soon-to-be second bride, Anna Murdoch Mann, whose maiden name was Torv.\n\nThey first met when Murdoch Mann was 18 years old when she had the opportunity to interview Murdoch while she worked for the Sydney newspaper, The Daily Telegraph, which he later owned.\n\nThe media mogul and Scottish-Australian novelist were married for 32 years and had three children together: Elisabeth Murdoch, Lachlan Murdoch, and James Murdoch.\n\nThough Murdoch's marriage with Anna was his longest, the couple did have a tumultuous relationship towards the end as rumors circulated that the media tycoon was having an affair with Wendi Deng, who was working as an intern for News Corp.-owned Star TV.\n\nMurdoch and Torv divorced in 1999.\n\n\"I thought we had a wonderful, happy marriage,\" she said in an interview with Australian Women's Weekly in 2001. \"Obviously we didn't.\"\n\nWendi Deng\n\nJust 17 days after his divorce from Anna Murdoch Mann was finalized in June 1999, Murdoch, then 68, married Chinese-American entrepreneur Wendi Deng, who was 31 at the time, as reported by the Evening Standard.\n\nThe pair had met when Deng was a 29-year-old intern for Star TV, a Hong Kong television station owned by News Corp. They share two daughters, Grace and Chloe.\n\nDeng and Murdoch separated in 2013.\n\nJerry Hall\n\nA week before his 85th birthday in 2016, Murdoch married former supermodel and actress Jerry Hall, then 59.\n\nHall was previously married to Rolling Stones singer Mick Jagger, with whom she shares four children, before they were granted an annulment in 1999.\n\nAfter six years of marriage, Hall filed for divorce from Murdoch in of June 2022, but in mid-August of last year, she filed a request in Los Angeles Superior Court to dismiss her original petition for divorce and for permission to file a new one, which was dismissed, the Associated Press reported.\n\nIn a joint statement a day after news reports of Hall's filing, their representatives announced they had finalized their divorce and \"remain good friends and wish each other the best for the future.\"\n\nAnn Lesley Smith\n\nIn March 2023, Murdoch's love life was back in the spotlight after he announced he was getting married for the fifth time.\n\nIn an interview with the New York Post, owned by Murdoch's News Corp., Murdoch said he proposed to his bride-to-be Ann Lesley Smith, then 66, a former model and San Francisco police chaplain, on St. Patrick's Day.\n\n\"I was very nervous,\" Murdoch told the Post. \"I dreaded falling in love — but I knew this would be my last. It better be. I'm happy.\"\n\nThe pair first met in September 2022 at his vineyard in Bel Air, California. Two weeks later, Murdoch said he called her.\n\nSmith, who was married to the late country musician Chester Smith who died in 2008, said, \"In perspective, it's not my first rodeo. Getting near 70 means being in the last half. I waited for the right time. Friends are happy for me.\"\n\nMurdoch added, \"We're both looking forward to spending the second half of our lives together.\"\n\nBut the engagement was short-lived. They called off the wedding just weeks later in April 2023.\n\nElena Zhukova\n\nWithin a year of calling off his last engagement, Murdoch popped the question to his current partner, Elena Zhukova, a retired molecular biologist who was once married to Russian billionaire Alexander Radkin Zhukov.\n\nZhukova's daughter, Dasha Zhukova, was formerly married to Russian oligarch Roman Abramovich.\n\nThe media mogul announced his engagement in March, less than a week shy of his 93rd birthday.\n\nOn June 1, they wed at Murdoch's luxury estate in California, Moraga Bel Air.\n\nEditor's note: This story was first published in March 2023 and has been updated to include Murdoch's most recent engagement."
