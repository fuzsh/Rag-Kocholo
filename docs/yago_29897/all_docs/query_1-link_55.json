        "text": "Photographs published in The Sun, the British tabloid owned by Murdoch, show the couple posing and smiling -- he in a black suit and yellow tie and she in an off-the-shoulder white gown as she clutched a bouquet of lilies of the valley.\n\nJet-set guests at the nuptials included Robert Kraft, 82, the owner of the New England Patriots US football team, and his 50-year-old wife Dana Blumberg, news reports said.\n\nMurdoch had previously been married four times, most recently to model Jerry Hall, the longtime partner of Rolling Stones frontman Mick Jagger.\n\nHis roller-coaster personal life is often fodder for the tabloid newspaper industry that he helped foster on three continents.\n\nLast year, Murdoch announced his engagement to dental hygienist-turned-conservative radio host Ann Lesley Smith, but called off the planned nuptials less than a month later.\n\nZhukova, who emigrated to the United States from Russia, is a retired molecular biologist.\n\nHer daughter, Dasha Zhukova, an arts patron and entrepreneur, was formerly married to the Russian oligarch Roman Abramovich.\n\nMurdoch, who has six children, was first married to Patricia Booker, an Australian flight attendant, whom he divorced in the late 1960s.\n\nHe and his second wife, Anna Torv, a newspaper reporter, were together more than 30 years before divorcing in 1999. His third marriage to Wendi Deng ended in 2013.\n\nThe Australia-born Murdoch, whose media empire includes The Wall Street Journal, Fox News and other influential outlets, and his family have a network of about $20 billion, according to Forbes.\n\nMurdoch handed over control of his global media empire to son Lachlan last November, shifting to an emeritus status.\n\nbur/dw/sst"
