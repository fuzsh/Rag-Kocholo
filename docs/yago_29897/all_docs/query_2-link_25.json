        "text": "When News Corp. chairman Rupert Murdoch married his third wife, Wendi Deng, in 1999, all four of his adult children attended the twilight ceremony aboard a yacht in New York harbor. But since then, the marriage has opened a rift between Murdoch and his older children, one that throws into doubt who will control the company after the media titan's death.\n\nThe bitter battle has all the hallmarks of a classic family drama. It pits the toddler children of Murdoch and Deng, a Chinese-born woman in her mid 30s, against Murdoch's children from his first two marriages. One of the key debates: Who should inherit the family's $6-billion fortune and Murdoch's control of News Corp. Should it be just the media titan's adult children, as is now the arrangement, or also his two youngest children by Deng?\n\nOne byproduct of the split came Friday when Lachlan Murdoch, 33, Murdoch's eldest son, quit as News Corp.'s deputy chief operating officer, a decision that shocked News Corp. executives. For Lachlan, the catalyst was a sense that his father was undercutting his work at News Corp., especially regarding the company's television stations, according to people familiar with the matter.\n\nBut relations between the older children and Murdoch are severely strained, according to two people familiar with the situation, in part over the children's unhappiness about their father's relationship with Deng. The broader drama made it impossible for Lachlan and his father to work out their workplace clashes, problems that might have been solved in the past, according to two people close to the situation.\n\nLachlan Murdoch, who was once seen as his father's heir apparent, said in a written statement last week he will relocate to Australia, which he considers home, with his wife and young baby. He will retain a seat on News Corp.'s board. In a written statement Friday, Murdoch, 74, said he was \"saddened\" by his son's decision.\n\nAt the heart of the strife tearing apart the extremely private Murdoch clan is tension over Deng's role in the family. Further complicating matters is stress caused by the coming generational shift, especially as the older children become more assertive about their financial interests, according to one person familiar with how the family operates. Murdoch \"has been alienated and isolated from his older kids,\" says another person close to the matter.\n\nThese broader problems have coalesced around the question of the Murdoch family's control of News Corp., one of the world's biggest media conglomerates. Its far-flung properties include the New York Post and Times of London newspapers, the Fox broadcast TV network, Fox News Channel, control of satellite-TV services such as BSkyB in the United Kingdom, Sky Italia in Italy and DirecTV in the United States, as well as the 20th Century Fox film studio.\n\nUnder the terms of Murdoch's divorce with second wife Anna, control of most of the Murdoch family's roughly 30 percent voting stake in News Corp. would be preserved for Anna's three children (Elisabeth, Lachlan and James) plus Prudence, a daughter from a previous marriage, according to two people familiar with the matter. The older children believe this meant that Deng and her future offspring were not to share in the block of voting stock held through a family trust, now valued at $5.1-billion, or nonvoting stock, also held in the trust, valued at almost $1-billion.\n\nMurdoch has since attempted to change that arrangement, say people familiar with the matter, to give some control of the stake to the two children born to his new wife: Grace, 3, and Chloe, 2.\n\nThe family split comes at a sensitive time for the media giant. For the first time in 50 years, Murdoch's control has come under threat. Liberty Media Corp., controlled by media titan John Malone, disclosed late last year it had boosted its voting stake in News Corp. to 18 percent, fewer than a dozen percentage points below the Murdoch family's 29.5 percent stake.\n\nThe two are trying to find ways to unwind Liberty's stake. The status of the talks isn't clear. A spokesman from Liberty Media had no comment.\n\nThe immediate catalyst for Lachlan Murdoch's resignation was the way his father undercut his role at the company, according to people familiar with the matter. Lachlan grew up on the Upper East Side of New York. His first job in the family business was as an intern at the Mirror newspaper in Sydney, Australia, cleaning the presses. After graduating from Princeton University, he began working as an executive in the Australian newspaper business.\n\nIn the six years since Murdoch married Deng, Lachlan has played an increasingly prominent role at the company. Just months before the wedding, he was given oversight over all of News Corp.'s U.S. print operations. A year later, he was named deputy chief operating officer, reporting to president and chief operating officer Peter Chernin, with added responsibility for the TV station group.\n\nBut despite his job title, one of the few businesses Lachlan had a free hand in managing was one of News Corp.'s smallest, the New York Post, a tabloid paper that was one of his father's first acquisitions after he moved to the United States in the 1970s. As a perpetual lossmaker, it didn't attract attention from other company executives.\n\nThe younger Murdoch quickly found himself being undermined in his attempts to deal with the station group, one of the biggest sources of conflict between Lachlan and his father. News Corp.'s 35 TV stations are some of the company's most important profit generators. Lachlan soon found himself out of the loop, in part because of the close relationship between the station group's chief executive, Jack Abernethy, and Fox News chief, Roger Ailes, a close confidant of the elder Murdoch.\n\nAiles has touted his influence at the station group since Abernethy took over. \"We have lunch every week now,\" Ailes said at a press breakfast in March. Neither Abernethy nor Ailes could be reached for comment.\n\nNews Corp. veterans say his father's interference shouldn't have come as a surprise to Lachlan, who has a more laid-back style than Murdoch.\n\nControl of the Murdoch family trust, and any funds it may ever disburse, is dictated by the ability to appoint directors to the trust company. Murdoch's four older children can appoint one representative each to the board _ a right reinforced in the divorce agreement between Murdoch and his second wife. Murdoch appoints the other four, who will leave the board upon his death and won't be replaced.\n\nAPPARENTLY NOT\n\nRupert Murdoch is the chairman and chief executive of News Corp. His son Lachlan was Murdoch's heir-apparent until Friday when he announced his resignation from his executive posts at the global media company.\n\nMARRIAGES CHILDREN\n\n1956-'66 Patricia Booker Prudence, 46.
