        "text": "Murdoch’s and Deng’s Wedding\n\nOn June 25, 1999, Murdoch and Deng were married on \"The Morning Glory\" yacht on New York's Hudson River. After 14 years of marriage, the media mogul filed for divorce on Thursday, June 13.\n\n2011 Allen & Company Conference\n\nMurdoch and Deng donned relaxing getups as they attended the 2011 Allen & Company Sun Valley Conference. The meeting typically involves the world's most powerful media executives. In Murdoch's company that year was Apple's Tim Cook, Washington Post's Don Graham and Barry Diller and fashion designer Diane von Furstenberg.\n\nLeaving the Royal Courts of Justice in 2012\n\nMurdoch and Deng were driven from the Royal Courts of Justice after providing evidence to the Leveson Inquiry. The phase of the inquiry — regarding culture, practice and ethics of the press in the U.K. — looked at the owners of various media groups. This came in the wake of the phone-hacking scandal that saw the closure of The News of the World newspaper in 2011."
