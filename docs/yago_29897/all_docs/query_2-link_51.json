        "text": "Media mogul Rupert Murdoch has married once again. For the fifth time.\n\nThe 93-year-old Fox and News Corp chairman exchanged “I Do’s” with Russian-born, retired molecular biologist Elena Zhukova, 67, at his California vineyard and estate, Moraga, on June 1, The Sun reported.\n\nDuring the ceremony, Zhukova sported a form-fitting, mid-length white Emilia Wickstead dress with a square neckline, while Murdoch wore a simple black suit paired with a white button-down shirt, completing the look with a pale yellow tie.\n\nPictures of the newlyweds were taken at the estate over the weekend and were released by News Corp.\n\nIn one of the photos, the two were pictured with their arms wrapped around each other, while in another, the couple sat in chairs outdoors.\n\nThe lavish event took place at the secluded property located in the Santa Monica Mountains in Los Angeles’ ritzy Bel Air neighborhood, according to the Moraga website.\n\nThis comes after the couple announced their engagement in March 2024. They had started dating the summer before, The New York Times reported.\n\nThis was after meeting through Murdoch’s third wife, Wendi Deng, according to The Daily Mail.\n\nMurdoch was most recently married to ex-wife, model and actress Jerry Hall. The pair got married in 2016 and divorced in 2022.\n\nHe married his third wife Deng two weeks after he finalized his divorce from his second wife, Anna Maria Torv, in 1999. The former couple share two daughters – Grace, born in 2001, and Chloe, born in 2003. Murdoch and Deng divorced in 2013 after 14 years of marriage.\n\nMurdoch is also father to four other children: daughter Elisabeth, born in 1968; son Lachlan, born 1971; and son James, born in 1972, with ex-wife Torv, whom he married in 1967.\n\nHis first child, daughter Prudence, born in 1958, was with his first wife, Patricia Booker. The couple married in 1956 and divorced in 1967, People reported."
