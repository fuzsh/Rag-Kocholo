        "text": "So, who are these brunette beauties and are they set to inherit any of their 91-year-old dad’s US$18 billion fortune?\n\nThey were raised in New York\n\nGrace was born in New York in 2001 and her younger sister Chloe followed two years later. They both grew up in Manhattan and attended the prestigious Brearley School. The two spent much of their time shuttling between family mansions across Los Angeles, Beverly Hills and Arizona, as per Guest of a Guest.\n\nAccording to her LinkedIn, Grace is currently completing her bachelor’s degree in history and East Asian literature at Yale, and has done internships at WeWork, The Wall Street Journal, Goop, Fox News, Charlotte Tilbury and now, Pace Gallery.\n\nCNN Business reports that Chloe studies at Stanford. Both being half-Chinese, the youngest Murdochs are also both reportedly fluent in Mandarin.\n\nA billionaire’s upbringing\n\nGuest of a Guest reports that the girls have been seen taking a sailing boat out with friends, as well as embarking on luxurious safaris, private jets and birthday parties in St. Tropez – it’s no surprise that Chloe and Grace took up the perks of the billionaire life.\n\nIn one photo posted by Grace, she shared a glimpse into what looks like her very modest university dorm, and she tagged her sister in the post.\n\nTony Blair, Nicole Kidman and Hugh Jackman are their godparents\n\nBut mum’s drama aside, Grace and Chloe have more famous faces to add to their extended family tree. In 2020, The Guardian confirmed that Australian veteran actors Nicole Kidman and Hugh Jackman became godparents to the young Murdochs at a baptism in Jordan. The nation’s Queen Rania proceeded to take Kidman, Jackman, the Murdochs and Ivanka Trump on a tour of the country’s best-known tourist sites after the ceremony.\n\nTony Blair, former prime minister of Britain, is also a godfather to Grace, per The Hollywood Reporter. Things may have got awkward in 2014 when Deng and Blair were caught up in largely unsubstantiated rumours of an alleged extramarital affair – denied by all parties.\n\nThe nanny drama\n\nIn 2012, a former nanny to the Murdoch household spoke to Gawker about her alleged year-long “war zone” experience working for the family. Hsu Ying-shu said that staff members included two secretaries, one cook, two housekeepers, a nanny, a tutor and one part-time laundry person. She said “everyone who works for [Wendi] hates her and is scared of her”. Hsu called Rupert “calm” and a “gentleman” in comparison.\n\nShe said that if Chloe wanted the nanny’s lunch, Deng would give it to her without getting Hsu another one. Meanwhile, Hsu claims that Deng told then-10-year-old Grace to be “skinny like a movie star”. The former nanny now lives on social security, per The Hollywood Reporter.\n\nRelated to Mick Jagger\n\nAfter Murdoch’s divorce from Deng, the billionaire married Jerry Hall, a long-time partner of rock legend Mick Jagger. That means Chloe and Grace added step-siblings Georgia May Jagger, Elizabeth Jagger, Gabriel Jagger and James Jagger to their growing family.\n\nIn August, however, Hall filed for divorce from Rupert, but the two “remain good friends”, Rupert’s lawyer said in a joint statement for the couple, according to Town and Country.\n\nAre they set to inherit the empire?\n\nYes. All of Rupert Murdoch’s six children are direct beneficiaries of the Murdoch Family Trust which makes around US$12 billion a year thanks to the sale of 21st Century Fox to Disney, according to Verdict UK in 2018. The girls’ step-siblings include Lachlan, James, Elisabeth and Prudence.\n\nAccording to The Financial Times, unlike their step-siblings, Chloe and Grace have no voting shares in the trust and have trustees to help manage their stakes."
