        "text": "Surprises are rarely a surprise with Rupert Murdoch. Murdoch-watchers were not surprised when he defied the odds and started a fourth network, and then Fox News, or when he broke his word to advance a business interest, or used his newspapers as a weapon to punish foes and reward allies. That he has filed for a divorce from his third wife, the former Wendi Deng, is not shocking. He is an opaque man who is uncomfortable discussing his feelings, which can make a marriage hard. Perhaps the split was occasioned by their four-decade age gap, or the assertive opinions she did not hide from a husband who likes to be in charge, or her aggressive socializing. Or the tension that has, at various times, surfaced between their children, as when Wendi unsuccessfully pushed for their young daughters, Grace and Chloe, to eventually have the same voting rights in News Corp. as Murdoch’s four adult children from his two previous marriages. Rupert Murdoch strives to be unencumbered—of old loyalties that intrude on business decisions, of pesky social obligations that eat up his precious time. Last year, when his family was divided over the hacking scandal in London, with his daughter Elisabeth, whom I wrote about, and his son James not speaking, and with Murdoch upset with Elisabeth and her husband for their criticism of News Corp.’s handling of the scandal, Murdoch agreed to join the family in a series of encounter sessions with a professional facilitator, in the manner of marriage counselling. Not long after those session began, they ended.\n\nIt was truly shocking when Rupert Murdoch and his second wife, Anna Torv Murdoch, divorced. When I wrote about Murdoch for The New Yorker, in 1995, I was struck by her sway over him. He allowed me to be a fly on the wall in his office for ten days, and from the first I was startled to see him munching on a plate of apples each morning and carrots each afternoon. He explained that Anna wanted him to do this. Over dinner, Murdoch, a man who enjoys his wine, would drink only a single glass. Again, he explained that he was following Anna’s instructions. He was generous with his time, but he sheepishly apologized that he could not persuade Anna to grant an interview. I don’t know whether his romance with Wendi, who was one of his employees, came before or after things between him and Anna came apart; he and Wendi were married in 1999, less than a month after the divorce from Anna was finalized. But it was no secret in the family that Anna wanted her husband to slow down, maybe retire, to spend more time at their California ranch riding horses, to indulge her by going to the opera. Eating carrots and drinking fewer glasses of wine was easy. Divorcing his beloved News Corp. was out of the question.\n\nIt is probably safe to assume that today’s divorce announcement was a business decision, too.\n\nAbove: Rupert Murdoch and Wendi Deng Murdoch in Sun Valley, Idaho, in July, 2012.
