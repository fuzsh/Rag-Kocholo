        "text": "He is smiling so broadly, you’d never imagine he’d done it before.\n\nBut here is Rupert Murdoch, looking like the cat that got the cream, after marrying for the fifth time on Saturday at the age of 93.\n\nOfficial wedding photographs released on Sunday show Mr Murdoch, the media tycoon, in high spirits with his new bride 67-year-old Elena Zhukova, a former molecular biologist born in Moscow.\n\nAmong the attendees was Wendi Deng, Mr Murdoch’s third wife who is reported to have hosted the party last year where the bride and groom first clapped eyes on each other.\n\nFor Mr Murdoch, an incorrigible romantic, it may well have been love at first sight.\n\nLachlan Murdoch, his eldest son at 52, who attended along with his wife Sarah were also among the close friends and family understood to have attended the intimate wedding. Just a few months ago the eldest Murdoch son was handed the keys to News Corp, the family firm.\n\nThe bride, a one-time mother-in-law of Roman Abramovich, wore an off-white, off-the-shoulder wedding dress while her new husband looked immaculate in a dark suit, white shirt and patterned yellow tie.\n\nMr Murdoch, perhaps in a single concession to his age, eschewed more formal footwear for super comfy black trainers.\n\nSuccession, the hit TV series, modelled in part on the internecine rows of Mr Murdoch and his children (he has six in all) could not have made up such a fairytale ending for the world’s most influential media magnate.\n\nThe ending in truth would have been all too saccharine for a series well known for its dark and bitter take on the lifestyle of billionaires.\n\nThe photos released – three in total – show Mr Murdoch’s new wife hugging him tenderly while holding a posy of Lily of the Valley flowers.\n\nIn another they are sat on chairs and she is laughing out loud and he is smiling broadly too. In the third, the happy couple are sat on an outdoor sofa, the couple appearing content. Mr Murdoch is clutching a glass that contains water.\n\nThe wedding took place in Mr Murdoch’s vineyard in California beneath suitably blue skies and in warm sunshine. It might have been fifth time around, but it’s hard to believe he’s had better weather than this.\n\nThe new Mrs Murdoch, despite her academic background, is no stranger to the high life. Alexander Zhukov, her former husband, was a Russian oil tycoon and their glamorous daughter Darya – known as Dasha – was married to Abramovich, the oligarch and one-time owner of Chelsea Football Club who is now on a sanctions list in the UK.\n\nMr Murdoch announced their engagement in March and came as something of a surprise.\n\nHe had previously been engaged to Ann Lesley Smith, a former police chaplain, but their relationship was abruptly called off in April last year.\n\nMr Murdoch’s fourth marriage to Jerry Hall, the ex-model, ended after seven years in June 2022. Saturday’s wedding appeared an altogether lower key affair. When Mr Murdoch married Hall, celebrity guests included Lord Lloyd Webber, Sir Michael Caine, Tracey Emin and Sir Bob Geldof among others as well as senior politicians Michael Gove and Priti Patel.\n\nPrevious wives were Patricia Booker, an Australian flight attendant, and Anna Mann, a Scottish-born journalist.\n\nRobert Thompson, the News Corp chief, and his wife Wang Ping were in attendance for the exclusive ceremony, as did Mr Murdoch’s niece Penny Fowler.\n\nGuests arrived at the sprawling 16-acre California winery in an array of luxury cars including Audis, Bentleys and Jaguars.\n\nStaff members were seen wheeling an array of beautiful white flowers and greenery in the direction of the estate under the watchful eye of security guards.\n\nMr Murdoch stood down as chairman of News Corporation, which owns the Sun and Times newspapers in the UK as well as US media outlets including Fox News and the Wall Street Journal."
