Brian McFadden's wife Vogue Williams has made a veiled attack on her new husband's ex-fiancée Delta Goodrem.

The Irish DJ, who wed Australia's Got Talent judge Brian in Italy in August, appears to have blasted Delta for airing her dirty laundry about her break-up with Brian on her new album Child of the Universe.

"You say you don't want to discuss your personal life so DON'T!! But please stop using it to promote yourself it's embarrassing ... #fake," Vogue tweeted.

Delta is currently on a media blitz to promote her fourth album. The Voice judge has previously been guarded when talking about the breakdown of her seven-year relationship in April 2011 — the lyrics on her new album speak otherwise.

"Go and live your life, find another wife," she sings on 'Lost All Love 4 U'.

"I am broken, there's a stranger on the phone, something is missing from seven years ago," the 27-year-old sings on 'I'm Not Ready'.

Delta and Brian reportedly signed a confidentiality agreement not to speak publicly about their split, according to The Daily Telegraph.

However, the Aussie pop diva gave interviews with 60 Minutes (watch below) and Vogue magazine (ironic, much?) in June talking about the break-up.

"Do I wish that it ended earlier? Yes. Do I wish I had the courage to leave earlier? Yes, I do," she said on 60 Minutes.

"I think what we came to is that we were very different people — extremely different people."

Last weekend, Delta told the Telegraph that, "if there's anything anyone wants to know about me, read my lyrics and listen to the record".

Go figure.
