So Brian McFadden and Delta Goodrem have finally admitted to being a couple. But just what is it with our celebs? They spend months telling us they're `good friends', then suddenly claim to have fallen in love `overnight'. This couldn't be more true in the case of ex-Westlifer Brian, 24, and 20-year-old Aussie songstress, Delta.

Brian, who split with his wife of two years, 24-year-old Kerry Katona, in September, has publicly admitted he is in a relationship with ex-Neighbours star Delta - but only after they were snapped kissing by a swimming pool during a romantic holiday in Cape Town over the New Year.

However, it's alleged he told Kerry - mother of the couple's two children, Molly, three, and 21-month-old Lily Sue - about his new love over the phone on Christmas Eve.

`It was the hardest conversation of my life, telling Kerry I was in love with someone else,' Brian says. `This was the final nail. I don't love her any more and we're not right for each other. Delta and I are an item.'

But it seems Kerry was well aware of a possible romance way before then. `The papers have been speculating for months they were in a relationship and Kerry certainly believes it didn't just start recently,' says a close pal. According to a source close to Kerry's family, her suspicions were proved correct when Brian confessed in the same phone conversation he'd been seeing Delta before they broke up. It's also alleged the main reason Kerry checked into the Priory Clinic, suffering from depression, was because of Delta.

`She was so devastated by Brian's relationship with Delta she could hardly face getting up in the morning,' says a pal. `She only went to the Priory because the thought of Brian being with Delta was driving her insane.'

Despite telling everyone his and Delta's romance started at the Royal Variety Show in December (the pair duetted on stage, and were seen flirting and being very `touchy-feely' according to a witness), the two singers have been friends since August. They met while recording a duet, Almost Here, for Brian's Irish Son album - a month before Brian called time on his marriage. The pair got on well, and Brian was quoted saying Delta was `amazing'. After breaking up with Kerry, he claimed Delta was `helping him' get over the pain, and the two shared many long phone calls.

Delta was dating Australian tennis star Mark Philippoussis at the time, but rumours were rife regarding the nature of her `friendship' with Brian. But Brian insisted, `There's absolutely no romance between Delta and I. People are just making these stories up because I've broken up with Kerry.'

A close pal of Kerry's disagrees. `Brian's claim he only started dating Delta at Christmas is rubbish,' she says.

Even when Delta and Mark split in October, Brian continued to deny the dating rumours well into November. Not content with just saying they weren't an item, Bri even went so far as saying he had `no intention of getting into another relationship soon', he didn't feel `single' and wasn't interested in `going out on the pull'. Even in December, he claimed not to have `snogged one girl' since splitting with Kerry.

Fast-forward a month, and he jetted 6,000 miles to spend a romantic holiday with Delta - a grand gesture for a `new' relationship. Brian then changed his mind, and on his return, confessed the pair got together in December. `It started at the Variety show,' he admits. `Everything clicked. It progressed from there.'

A source close to Brian says he kept his romance with Delta a secret because it was `early days'. It seems more likely he was waiting for a `decent' amount of time to elapse from his split with Kerry before announcing he was cavorting with someone else. Or perhaps the fact he released his duet with Delta shortly after making his love confession isn't such a coincidence after all...
