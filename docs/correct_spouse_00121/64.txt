Brian McFadden's ex-wife Kerry Katona has revealed that she begged him to give her another chance after he’d left their marriage and hooked up with Delta Goodrem in 2004.

"It had all ended so suddenly," the former Atomic Kitten member writes in her upcoming autobiography, Still Standing, obtained by the UK’s Mirror.

"At the time I had known in my heart, whether he would admit it to himself or not, that the main reason he wanted out was how close he was getting to Delta.

"She is so tall and slim, and classy, compared to a small, curvy and gobby northern lass like me. No wonder he had fancied her. And the sexual tension between them was right obvious."

"I kept thinking, 'What if the early days of romance and sexual chemistry had worn off and he was wishing he could get back with me and have our family back together again?' And although I knew it was only a tiny chance, I decided to ring him."

"Please, Brian!" Kerry allegedly asked him. "The girls need you, I need you! Give us another chance. We have to make it work, we've got kids. We should be a family."

To which Brian reportedly replied, "Kerry, it's too late, I've moved on, I'm with Delta now. I don't love you. Goodbye."

"I slid down on to the bathroom floor crying, broken, and hysterical. I had never felt so alone or so, so low. For me, that had been the last-ditch phone call, my final appeal for help and a chance to get my life back on track — and it had failed. So that was it. Game over."

The former Australia's Got Talent judge was 22 and singing in boy-band Westlife when he married Kerry, who was 21 at the time.

The pair had two children together and split in 2004, just two years after their nuptials.

Brian married his current wife Vogue McFadden (née Williams) in August.
