        "text": "ShowbizGosQueen wrote:\n\n:yawn:\n\nOh, do get over yourself! :rolleyes:\n\nI wouldn't say anything written by myself or the other main contributors on the very impressive Victoria Beckham thread is 'really sick' or 'borne out of jealousy or spite' - they're just our opinions - seriously, 'really sick' doesn't come anywhere close and I think you're being a tad over the top to be honest\n\nAs I've said before :yawn: what irritates me about the Beckhams is their desperate need to be in the news to support their ridiculously lavish lifestyle, their ongoing press manipulation and their constant lies to try and protect their money making machine 'Brand Beckham'\n\nAnd when you put yourself up for public consumption as much as the Beckhams, you have to expect things to be said/written about you - that's part of the deal - good or bad - and in this country, people have the right to say what they like, whether you like it or not - it's called freedom of speech\n\nI have a great partner, who's faithful to me, I have a career (unlike Mrs Beckham) and we're hopefully going to buy a house very soon. Yes, it may not be a big or expensive as 'Beckingham Palace' but it'll be a thousand times classier, I promise you. I'm happy with my lot and I'm not greedy. Is Victoria Beckham happy? I seriously doubt it - after all, she never looks it :rolleyes:\n\nEmzi wrote:\n\nIn Heat magazine this week, there's an article (basically) claiming that the body language between Delta and Brian in TV interviews is somewhere between luke warm and icy, and that Delta in 'in charge' of the interviews. Having seen the interviews myself, I have to agree. And writing \"I love you\" on Brians hand as he's about to be photographed strumming a guitar smacks of a poor publicity stunt.\n\nIt will be interesting to see how the romance affects the sales of the single when the charts are out this afternoon.\n\nMany people have commented that it's unfair to pick on Delta because of her illness, others see it as sympathy excuse getting in the way of something more calculated (i.e music sales, publicity). But I guess that's a whole new debate which I'm not getting into!!"
