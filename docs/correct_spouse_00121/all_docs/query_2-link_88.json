        "text": "From mega-selling boy-band star to tabloid pariah, Brian McFadden has done much of his growing up in public.\n\nBRIAN McFadden used to dread flying. Not for the mundane reasons that afflict most of us, but because back home in Britain he couldn't pass through an airport without being swamped by either fans in search of photos and autographs, or foes determined to share their negative opinion of his music.\n\nIn Australia, it's a different story. The former member of boy band Westlife is better known here as Delta Goodrem's fiance (right), and the 28-year-old Irishman says that suits him down to the ground.\n\n\"It's actually been a relief,\" he says of life in the shadow of Goodrem. \"It's nice to have the pressure off and come under the radar. Especially coming into airports — now I can just sneak off and get the bags. If anything, being with Delta has helped. People here listened to what I have to say because of Delta.\"\n\nWith Westlife, Brian McFadden sold 40 million records. Four years after leaving the group, he is attempting to reignite his solo career with an album and a series of live dates around the country, including a show at Crown tonight.\n\nMcFadden began performing in the five-piece Westlife — the creation of pop music impresario and American Idol judge Simon Cowell — when he was 18. Although he played guitar and piano and wrote songs, he and the rest of the band struggled to be taken seriously as musicians. \"We never got any respect as artists because we didn't write all the songs and we weren't a self-producing product,\" he says. \"We were being controlled more like puppets than anything else.\"\n\nMcFadden and his bandmates had input but Cowell called the shots. Things came to a head in 2004, when Cowell played the group Barry Manilow's Mandy and told them they would be recording a cover of it as their next single.\n\n\"They were formulating how to get a No. 1 record,\" McFadden says. \"I wanted to write my own songs and sing my own music.\"\n\nAt first, his decision to go solo appeared to be vindicated. With Robbie Williams' songwriting muse Guy Chambers, he co-wrote Real to Me. His debut solo single was a chart-topper throughout Europe.\n\nBut soon things went wrong. McFadden separated from his wife, former Atomic Kitten star Kerry Katona, and moved into the London home of Australian pop princess Delta Goodrem.\n\nMcFadden has always claimed his marriage was over by the time he and Goodrem hooked up; his former wife insists otherwise. Whatever the details, the result was that McFadden's fans turned on him.\n\nTicket sales for his first solo tour stopped almost instantly. The British tabloids took to describing Goodrem and McFadden as \"homewreckers\". In McFadden's view, the mud still sticks. Goodrem's international focus is now in the US, while McFadden is yet to release his latest album in Britain.\n\n\"That (scandal) has shaped my career,\" he says. \"Hero to villain literally in one weekend.\"\n\nMcFadden's self-deprecating sense of humour has been used to good effect in his appearances on Spicks and Specks and as the host of Foxtel's Football Superstar. He has turned up regularly on Sydney radio and hosted the Dolly Teen Choice Awards in Sydney on Wednesday.\n\nBut he says he is not here permanently. \"I arrived in February to release an album, and just haven't left,\" he says. \"It's just gone so well here I haven't had a reason to go home yet.\"\n\nHe has in fact been back twice this year, but to see his two daughters rather than to work. Next year, he will attempt to break the ice in Britain with the album Set in Stone, which hit the ARIA top five in May.\n\n\"I don't have a script,\" McFadden says, of both his live show and his life in Australia. \"It's great not to be associated with Westlife. There's no preconceived notions about me here.\"\n\nBut, he adds: \"I won't have the same comfort when I go back to England next year. It's always going to be about Westlife.\"\n\nBrian McFadden is at the Palms at Crown at 8 o'clock tonight.\n\nDetails: ticketek.com.au\n\nSinger proved too vocal for Westlife\n\nBRIAN McFadden says nothing has changed in the past four years that has made him regret leaving Westlife (below left).\n\nBut when pushed he admits to a slight bout of envy over a recent gig the band did in Ireland. McFadden's dream as a performer had always been to play Dublin's Croke Park Stadium. Only U2 and Garth Brooks had played the 80,000-capacity venue. \"It was always a big goal of ours and they finally did it,\" he says.\n\nWestlife is one of a handful of successful commercial pop acts founded by American Idol judge Simon Cowell. Although virtually unknown in Australia until it hit No. 1 last year, the band has sold a staggering 40 million albums. Cowell was unknown outside of the music industry when McFadden first met him in the late 1990s. The relationship worked well early but towards the end of McFadden's time in the band, he struck trouble as he became more vocal about its direction.\n\n\"Simon didn't like the fact that his artists could talk for themselves. But it's all fine now. He's actually been quite supportive of my solo career.\""
