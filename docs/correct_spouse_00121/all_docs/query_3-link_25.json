        "text": "Reports emerged this week that he had already gotten down on bended knee and proposed to rumoured love interest, Delta Goodrem.\n\nAnd while she was quick to is come out and slam the latest talk as 'ridiculous and completely untrue', DJ and reality star Chris Stafford is remaining resolutely silent on the matter.\n\nSpeaking to Daily Mail Australia on Tuesday, the upbeat Stafford Brothers hitmaker said: 'it's crazy what they come up with,' but declined to comment on his supposed romance 'at this stage'.\n\nScroll down for video\n\nStaying mum: Chris Stafford is remaining resolutely quiet on rumours he is romancing Delta Goodrem after she slammed a magazine report claiming they are engaged\n\nThe rumour mill has been abuzz with speculation the handsome hunk has taken The Voice coach Delta, 30, off the market, and while his reputation as somewhat of a party boy has had many doubting its veracity, the the talented musician insists it only extends as far as the job.\n\n'Our job is to go in there and make sure you have a good time, we want to enjoy the party with [our fans] - but I'm not saying we're mental and we're crazy!' Chris tells DMA of the nature of his and brother Matt's work.\n\nRELATED ARTICLES\n\nPrevious\n\n1\n\nNext\n\nDelta Goodrem's rumoured beau Chris Stafford finds unique... 'Ridiculous and COMPLETELY UNTRUE!' Furious Delta Goodrem...\n\nShare this article\n\nShare\n\n'During the week it's actually the absolute opposite, it's one extreme to the other!\n\n'We're actually in the gym working out, eating healthy... we actually do like being healthy. From our stage persona to what we are during the week we're completely different.'\n\nWith such a close affinity to his brother - whom he lives, travels and performs with - strong family values are also something Chris holds close to his heart and he says he is 'definitely family orientated' and 'for sure' wants children of his own when the time is right.\n\nSecret? The pair have yet to confirm their romance with rumours they're keeping it quiet in fear of what Delta's legions of fans, who know her for her squeaky clean image, would think (they are pictured here with a fan)\n\n'At this point in my life it's a bit difficult with the travel and touring around, I think if you want to [start a family] you have to make a decision to do that, I like to do everything to the best of my ability and if I can't settle down and have a family at this point in my life, I don't want to do it just as yet.\n\n'[My brother and I] love our family we come together all the time. When we're in Australia we have a Tuesday night dinner at my mum and dad's,' he adds.\n\n'We definitely have a close knit family, my parents come to our gigs, they come along and are as welcome as everyone else.'\n\nChris' bond with his brother is also a strong one and the pair will be appearing together in Tuesday night's episode of Bondi Ink to get matching tattoos.\n\nThe 30-year-old singer and her rumoured DJ love are yet go public with their relationship but it's understood the couple have been going strong for one year now and are keen to tie the knot and start a family.\n\n'She's definitely conscious of her age and has wanted to start a family for ages,' the insider told the publication.\n\nParty boys? Chris and his brother Matt make up DJ duo The Stafford Brothers, and have garnered a reputation over their years on tour for their partying ways\n\nWoman's Day claimed back in June that Chris has been keeping his romance with former Neighbours star Delta a secret for some time but that they are both utterly smitten.\n\nSources told the publication that they have wanted to keep their romance underwraps, in fear of what Delta's legions of fans, who know her for her squeaky clean image, would think.\n\nBut in fact, Chris is almost just as clean - at least according to his lifestyle habits.\n\nA fan of the very physically demanding cross fit, Chris says he drinks a fruit and vegetable juice 'every single day' with beetroot, lemon and ginger being one of his favourites, and even tries to stick to a largely vegan diet.\n\nDJ life: The talented music maker says his partying persona doesn't necessarily extend to his life off stage\n\nOnly a stage thing: He says outside of his sets, he is all about healthy eating and fitness (pictured here with his brother and Paris Hilton)\n\n'We try and do detoxes and all that sort of stuff, like we eat more of like a strict vegan diet, we try and eat a bit more like that,' he says.\n\n'I like feeling good as well as having a good time. You've got to have that sort of side to your life - if you're doing just drinking and partying all the time I don't think you could survive.\n\nThe New Zealand born hitmaker says this particularly rings true during the week when the boys find themselves in the recording studio and in various meetings, saying: 'you need to be switched on'.\n\nNot possible: Chris, who appears on this week's episode of Bondi Ink, says he 'could not function' if he really partied as much as his reputation leads to believe\n\n'You could not function and create what we have if we were just the party boy image.'\n\nThe weekends meanwhile, are almost wholly consumed with gigs so very little time remains for the pair to be hitting the town for wild nights out.\n\nIn his years touring the world with his music, Chris has been known for his love of the party scene, something that dates back to the influence of his fun-loving parents.\n\nLast year he and his brother and the other half of their act Matt, were embroiled in legal action in the US, and were being sued for $140,000 after allegedly trashing a house they rented to film one of their music videos.\n\nHowever at the time the brothers said they don't feel like they've done anything wrong with Chris telling Sydney Confidential: 'The claims are so wrong that we are just like, we know we're going to win.\n\n'We don't really think about it. Apparently [law suits] take two years in America so we just have to keep going with it.'\n\n'Ridiculous and completely untrue': Meanwhile Delta slammed speculation she is engaged after she flashed a ring on THAT finger at Sunday's The Voice finale\n\nChris found himself the subject of front page news again this week when Woman's Day published claims he had proposed to Delta, and received a yes.\n\nDelta was quick to dismiss the report however, with the Wings singer taking to Facebook to label it, 'ridiculous and completely untrue'.\n\n'I cannot believe what I'm reading. Woman's Day, don't hide behind a veil of a source that does not exist or clearly has NO access to the truth,' she wrote.\n\nAccording to the magazine, the singer is 'set to marry' her rumoured beau and is said to be planning a wedding for sometime this year.\n\nRelationship past: She has previously dated Brian McFadden (left), Mark Philippoussis (right) and Nick Jonas\n\nFeeling clucky? A source claims the 30-year-old wants to start a family, something Chris is also eager to do in future\n\nThe 'insider' told the publication the pair are smitten and looking forward to their big day, saying the celebrity-filled extravaganza: 'will be the wedding of the year'.\n\nAs Delta left The Voice Australia finale on Sunday night, the singer did indeed look happy as she mingled with waiting fans.\n\nSigning autographs and posing for photographs, the blonde beauty now only showed off her enviable figure in a low-cut jumpsuit but also a ring on THAT finger.\n\nHowever, the jewellery was one of many rings the singer sported on her left hand that night - possibly to hide the special piece of bling, with only a silver band visible.\n\nncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pa3IpbCmmZmhe6S7ja6iaKymqLWww8GisWiZoqm2pLjEZmpraWdsgHZ7oqGpoqtdiMGissWoqZ1lo5bGtHnWmqWtq12Ytaq4w6ucp2WimrO2v8SsZJqclKeytL%2BMq6ymp6WnwG6xzaCYoJ2dmru1eaOeo62ZXXy8sLDRnqRnoKSiuQ%3D%3D"
