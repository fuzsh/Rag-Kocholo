        "text": "Former Atomic Kitten singer Kerry Katona hit back at former Westlife singer Brian McFadden's joke that their two daughters were 'f**king sick' of being bridesmaids.\n\nKerry, who is also a well-known TV personality in the UK, has been married three times, but her ex-husband Brian is currently preparing to marry for the third time.\n\nToday's top videos\n\n'That's Bri for you, trying to be funny but being a bit of a d**k in the process,' she said in her New! magazine column.\n\n'For the record, Brian's been engaged more times than I have, too!' the 39-year-old pointed out.\n\nKerry also acknowledged that while Brian has a point that their daughters 'are probably sick of weddings', but added: 'I've no doubt they'll support their dad 100% when he walks down the aisle again.'\n\nThe exact comments that Brian made were recently published in OK! Magazine were: 'They’ve been bridesmaids for their mother about five times already so they’re probably sick of it. There’s only so many times you can be a bridesmaid. They must be thinking, ‘Not another f**king wedding!’\n\nThe couple's romance was well-known in the early 2000s and in 2002, Brian and Kerry got married.\n\nHowever, they separated in 2004 and then divorced in 2006 when Brian got with Australian singer Delta Goodrem.\n\nThe pair are the parents of 18-year-old Molly and 16-year-old Lilly, while Kerry has had three other children after their divorce.\n\nKerry has been no stranger to controversy over the years.\n\nShe recently lambasted a weight-loss website which falsely claimed that the singer and TV presenter used their product to help her get fit."
