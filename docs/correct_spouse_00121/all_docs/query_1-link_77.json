        "text": "Brian McFadden has confirmed that he wants to marry Australian singer Delta Goodrem.\n\nThe former Westlife star, who has been dating Goodrem since 2004, said that his failed marriage to Atomic Kitten Kerry Katona will not deter him from tying the knot again.\n\n\"I think every man who goes through a divorce gets the feeling of: \"I'm never doing that again\", but when the time is right I probably would get married and I would definitely marry Delta,\" McFadden told Now magazine.\n\nAsked about how he has kept his relationship with Delta going strong, Brian replied: \"We just created a bubble. It's so much easier when you can share problems rather than bottle them up on your own.\"\n\nMcFadden met Goodrem when they teamed up to record their Almost Here duet over three years ago."
