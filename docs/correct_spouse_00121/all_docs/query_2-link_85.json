        "text": "Brian McFadden and his fiancée Danielle Parkinson have been opened up after the 39-year-old had a miscarriage.\n\nThe couple, who got engaged in December 2019, revealed they have been trying to conceive for two years and are \"desperate\" to have a baby together.\n\nDanielle has now been undergoing IVF treatment for over a year and fell pregnant following their first round.\n\nHowever, she lost the baby five weeks later, telling OK! Magazine: \"I was about five weeks in. I felt pregnant. I had a backache and some tiredness.\n\n\"Then I started bleeding and the symptoms disappeared. I took a pregnancy test and it was negative. A blood test in hospital confirmed I’d lost the baby.\"\n\nBrian was in Dubai when Danielle found out and revealed her boyfriend didn't believe the news.\n\nDanielle then travelled to Dubai to see a \"top gynaecologist in the UAE\" for a scan, which confirmed the news.\n\nWho is Brian McFadden? Dancing on Ice and Westlife star's wife, children, height and more facts\n\nBrian said: \"That’s when it hit me. It was the worst sinking feeling ever.\"\n\nDanielle went on to say that the pair are \"considering using a surrogate.\"\n\nBrian also added: \"Adoption is an option too, but right now I have a feeling the IVF will work for us. We were so close that first time.\n\n\"If we want to get pregnant we have to be positive, I really believe that. When you have a positive mental attitude it affects your body.\"\n\nBrian was married to Kerry Katona from 2002 until they separated in 2004, with their divorce being finalised in 2006.\n\nThe former couple share Molly, 18, and Lily-Sue, 16.\n\nThe ex-Westlife singer was then a long-term relationship with Australian singer Delta Goodrem from 2004 until 2011.\n\nBrian married Vogue Williams in 2011 but separated in 2017."
