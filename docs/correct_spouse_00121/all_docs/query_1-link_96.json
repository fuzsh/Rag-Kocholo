        "text": "By CMU Editorial | Published on Wednesday 2 March 2011\n\nOh, it’s alright everyone. When Brian McFadden sang about taking a drunk woman home to “do some damage” and “take advantage” in his new song ‘Just The Way You Are (Drunk At The Bar)’, he wasn’t talking about women in general, just his wife, Delta Goodrem. Which is apparently fine.\n\nThere was a bit of a furore after the song went online last week, because people for some reason thought that lines like, “I like you just the way you are, drunk as shit dancing at the bar” and “can’t wait to get you home so I can do some damage, can’t wait to get you home and take advantage” were a bit suspect. But they’re not, Brian says so.\n\nMcFadden told The Daily Mirror: “I am shocked at these ridiculous accusations about my new song. For the record I wrote the song about how I love it when Delta has a drink – which is very rarely – and she’s dancing”.\n\nHe then added via Twitter: “My new song is a tongue-in-cheek song about how I find it cute when my girl gets drunk. I am not promoting date-rape. What’s the next thing I am going to be labelled as from things I say? Super intelligent reaction to my song. Wish I was as clever as them. And yes it is dumb lyrics and a dumb beat, that was the point! When did I ever claim to be John Lennon?”\n\nSo, there you go. Not suspect at all. Not at all. Damn you intelligent people with your thoughts ruining Brian’s lyrics. He just wants to ‘damage’ his wife sexually while she’s drunk. Oh, no, hang on, it is still awful."
