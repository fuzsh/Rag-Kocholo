        "text": "Goodrem is understood to have called off her engagement to McFadden last week after months of drifting apart, the Herald Sun reported.\n\nMcFadden, 30, and Goodrem, 26, confirmed their engagement and relationship was finished in a joint statement yesterday.\n\n\"This decision has been made with a lot of soul searching from both parties with the realisation that they have grown apart,\" the statement said.\n\n\"They leave the partnership with respect for one and other, wishing each other success and happiness for the future.\"\n\nFriends said McFadden had found life difficult in Delta's golden shadow and had struggled to balance the public's adoration of her, while he was constantly painted as a reckless bad boy.\n\n\"In some ways, it was hard for him to be the back seat to the Delta Show,\" one said.\n\n\"No one could live up to that expectation.\"\n\nBoth parties are said to be heartbroken over the split.\n\nYesterday, McFadden tweeted:\n\nBrianMcFaddeni love delta and always will. She is one of gods living angels. I thank her for giving me the best years of my life. Please give us time x\n\nPals insist the split was mutual and no third parties were involved.\n\nBut one close friend added: \"The writing had been on the wall for quite a while\".\n\nWhile Goodrem has spent almost a decade as Australian pop's golden child, McFadden has been dogged by controversy, a string of Twitter wars and headline-making behaviour.\n\nIn February, Federal Police were called to meet him at an airport following allegations of being abusive to staff, drunken behaviour and smoking on a V Australia flight from LA - all of which McFadden has denied.\n\nLast week, the Grand Prix celebrity driver caused a scene at Melbourne's Rockpool restaurant - walking out after verbally abusing staff.\n\nOn the track, he was also reckless, running ironman Shannon Eckstein off the road in a preliminary race.\n\nMcFadden will be taken out by friends this weekend in Sydney to drown his sorrows, while Goodrem is understood to be holed up in Los Angeles. Fellow Aussie, presenter Renee Bargh, has been comforting the Lost Without You singer."
