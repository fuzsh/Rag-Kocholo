        "text": "You have to give credit to Vogue Williams for her ability to turn almost anything into material for her funny podcast, including the end of her first marriage to Brian McFadden.\n\nVogue, who is now happily married to Spencer Matthews, tied the knot with the former Westlife star in 2012 but it wasn’t meant to be and they announced their split in 2015.\n\nToday's top videos\n\nThe latest extra clip of My Therapist Ghosted Me saw Vogue and her good pal Joanne McNally read out emails from listeners looking for advice on their love lives, with one person writing in about their love interest moving to Australia.\n\nHaving had her own experience with relocating across the world for a man, Vogue didn’t hesitate to jump in and sarcastically recall how things ‘worked out really well’ for her.\n\nThe listener explained to the podcast-hosts-turned-agony-aunts that despite ‘falling in love’ with a 6’4 man, they had called it quits because he was moving to Australia.\n\n'My situationship has ended after we both caught the feels,’ they explained. 'We met in 2021 and gave a proper go of things. We knew he was going to Australia so we never made things official… There were dinner dates, Christmas presents, my mum said hi, introduction to friends, we weren’t far off [a real relationship].'\n\nVogue and Joanne were astounded by this rundown, with the mum-of-three teasing that it sounded more like 'a marriage' than a situationship and that she’d be ‘taking half’ if she was involved.\n\nShe said: 'I also blame Australia for my first marriage, but anyway… why don't you go to Australia, why hasn't he invited you to Australia? Why aren’t you going over with him?'\n\nVogue then jokingly advised that the listener follow in her footsteps and declared: ‘Do what I did, follow a relationship to Australia, it will work out really well!’\n\nShe continued to say that if ‘it’s a possibility’ then moving to Australia wouldn’t be the worst thing to try as at least it’s ‘a nice place, it's warm, it's sunny’. Clearly Vogue is more of a glass half full, than half empty type of person!\n\nJoanne and Vogue’s conversation then took a deep turn as they deliberated over the listener's problem, with them saying that you can never really have a ‘one that got away’.\n\nSeemingly recalling her own past loves, Vogue said: 'When you meet the one that didn't get away - after the one you thought got away - you'll realise the one that you thought got away isn't the one that got away… because he was c**p!'\n\nJoanne added: ‘There isn't a “the one that got away” because if they were into you they wouldn't have gone away - there’s no such thing. The only solution is to be with someone who wants to be with you. If they went away, they went away for a reason… they left.’\n\nVogue met her ex Brian at a party in Dublin in 2011 soon after he called off his engagement to Australian singer Delta Goodrem, according to the Belfast Telegraph.\n\nSoon after their first meeting, Vogue moved to Australia to be with Brian while he was working as a judge on Australia’s Got Talent. They confirmed their engagement in January 2012.\n\nAccording to MailOnline, Vogue previously admitted that she was 'running away' from everything happening in her life, including grieving her dad who died in 2010, when she met Brian and moved to Australia.\n\n'I see now it might have been better if I hadn't run, and if Brian had lived in Ireland;' she said. 'I would have been with him anyway, but he lived in Australia, so I went there... At the time, I saw no reason not to. But looking back, I see that I wanted to get away from the grief.'"
