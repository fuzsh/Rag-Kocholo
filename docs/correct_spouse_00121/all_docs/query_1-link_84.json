        "text": "BRIAN McFadden is consulting lawyers about custody of his children after his former wife was caught in a drugs sting, according to UK reports.\n\nMcFadden's ex, British reality TV star Kerry Katona, appears to take cocaine in secret video footage obtained by London's News of the World newspaper.\n\nThe pair have two children together, Molly, 7, and Lilly-Sue, 6, who were allegedly in another room when Katona snorted a white powder in her Cheshire home.\n\nFormer Westlife singer McFadden, now engaged to Delta Goodrem, has been publicly silent over the expose but a source told British papers he was \"fuming''.\n\n\"He is talking to fiancee Delta Goodrem and is also consulting his lawyers to see what arrangement they can come to about his kids . . . he no longer wants them to stay with Kerry.\n\n\"He no longer feels they are safe with her.''\n\nPublicist Max Clifford, who cut ties with Katona last year after raising concerns about her drinking, said she now faced losing her children.\n\n\"For the sake of her kids she should get a grip on herself - she has been on a downward spiral for a long time,'' Clifford said.\n\n\"Maybe this will make her evaluate and finally stand up and do what she needs to do. It is sad. We tried long and hard to help her.\n\n\"It also puts in doubt her being fit to look after the children. So Brian McFadden will be possibly be attempting to get custody, as he has done in the past.''\n\nThe former member of girl group Atomic Kitten was this week dumped from her $500,000 role promoting supermarket chain Iceland as a result of the revelations.\n\nWith ratings from her most recent reality TV shows reportedly in freefall and her popularity on the wane, the lucrative deal had been crucial to her finances."
