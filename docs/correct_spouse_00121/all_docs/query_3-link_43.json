        "text": "Kerry Katona has branded her marriage to Brian McFadden \"fake\", claiming she \"just went along with it\".\n\nThe pair were dubbed the golden couple of showbiz when they dated for three years and later tied the knot in 2002.\n\nThey have two children, Molly in 2001 and Lily-Sue in 2003, but their relationship sadly collapsed and they filed for divorce in 2004, which was finalised two years later.\n\nKerry, 42, said that growing up, she was \"desperate to be loved\" and \"so desperate to please\", but admits she went about it \"the wrong way\".\n\nSpeaking about her marriage to Brian, she commented: \"Obviously first marriage I thought it would last forever, I just went along with it.\n\n\"It was just fake, it wasn't real, it wasn't meant to be - it wasn't what I wanted, it was all fake and phoney.\"\n\nThe Warrington-born star admitted she has not spoken to Brian since their daughter Molly's 21st birthday and added they have no reason to talk anymore as their kids are now adults.\n\nThe Whole Again singer claimed her two daughters will call her fiancé Ryan Mahoney before they will phone their dad.\n\nShe told The Mirror: \"Not that we really talked, we never really had that kind of close relationship, they'll ring Ryan before they ring Brian. If they need money, they ring Ryan.\n\n\"That's just how it is, he's got his own little family now, Ryan pays for Molly's car insurance. Molly and Ryan have such a great relationship, it's funny when they're together.\"\n\nBrian McFadden's representatives declined to comment when approached by Express.co.uk\n\nFollowing his split from Kerry, Brian began dating Australian singer and Neighbours actress Delta Goodrem.\n\nAt one point Brain even proposed, but in 2011 their seven-year relationship came to an end.\n\nBrian's second marriage was to Irish model Vogue Williams and they tied the knot in 2012, but the pair parted ways three years later with their divorce being finalised in 2017.\n\nThe Westlife singer is now married to Danielle Parkinson and the couple welcomed a daughter in June 2021."
