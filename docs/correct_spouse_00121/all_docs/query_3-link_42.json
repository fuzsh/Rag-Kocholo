        "text": "Perhaps she hopes to weather the storm by simply remaining aloof. \"Lately I've realised there can be a lot of nastiness, and there can be a lot of things that really hurt, and that you feel like you've been completely exposed,\" she said in an interview with Channel 9's 60 Minutes last Sunday. \"You learn to be guarded, then you learn to be open, then you're guarded again. And you sort of go, 'Well I think you've just always got to be dignified and just always keep your dignity, and at the end of the day just keep a good sense of self, and you'll be OK'.\"\n\nBack in 2003, Goodrem's story was much simpler. It was a tale of talent, determination and seemingly inevitable triumph. Since announcing at the age of eight that she wanted to be a singer and an actor, Goodrem had been relentless in her pursuit of the spotlight. She had filled her free time to bursting with singing, dancing and piano classes, while most of her schoolmates were watching TV or chatting on their mobile phones. \"Delta was quite a driven child,\" her mother Lea Goodrem said in April 2003. \"Delta would have done everything if there was enough time in the day. I was quite happy she wanted to do lots of things – I didn't know she wanted to do everything.\"\n\nAt 13, Goodrem sent a demo recording to the Sydney Swans, in the hope that she might one day sing at one of their matches. The recording eventually made its way into the hands of Swans supporter and artist manager Glenn Wheatley. \"I saw confidence right from the word go,\" Wheatley later said. \"I saw the spark of ingenuity. She was anxious to get going, but I thought she was a little young.\"\n\nWheatley, whose best-known client remains industry veteran John Farnham, was gradually won over by Goodrem's tenacity. He signed her to his management company Talentworks in 1999 when she was just 14 years old. In 2000, his efforts saw Goodrem sign to Sony Music, and in November of the following year her debut single – an anonymous slice of Britney-esque tweenpop called I Don't Care – was released. It peaked at an unremarkable No. 64 on the singles charts.\n\nThings began to look up for Goodrem when she was offered a role on Neighbours early in 2002. Wheatley cunningly spun her character Nina Tucker into an aspiring songwriter, and used the television exposure to relaunch Goodrem's musical career. In October 2002, when the shy, selfdoubting Tucker performed Born To Try on the show, it was to an internationally televised audience of millions, virtually assuring the single's success on its release a month later.\n\nWhen the album Innocent Eyes came out in March 2003 it went straight to No. 1. It was still there in July (and in fact would remain there for 26 weeks, thereby beating the record held by Wheatley's other charge, John Farnham, for Whispering Jack) when a strange lump in Goodrem's neck was diagnosed as Hodgkin's lymphoma, a serious but treatable form of lymphatic cancer. Goodrem cancelled all appearances, shelved plans to launch her album in the US, and went to hospital.\n\nA massive outpouring of public sympathy followed, but at its height, while Goodrem was still undergoing painful and disorientating chemotherapy, her reputation took its first battering when she announced a split with Glenn Wheatley. \"I am grateful for the work that Glenn has put into my career,\" read her statement issued on October 4, 2003. \"However, there have been some recent life-changing experiences for me and my wishes are that while I spend time to concentrate on my recovery, I have the time to reassess my life and how I see my future.\"\n\nDespite these vague, flowery sentiments, the truth was decidedly harder-edged. \"My relationship with Glenn had not been good for some time before I got the cancer,\" Goodrem told The Australian Women's Weekly in April 2004. \"When that came along, it put everything else in my life in perspective, sharp perspective. In the end, it was an easy decision.\"\n\nGoodrem apparently believed her manager was devoting too much time to her chart rival; Wheatley had spent seven months of 2003 working on John Farnham's massive Last Time tour, and Goodrem was feeling neglected. Wheatley, in turn, was hurt and angered by Goodrem's departure, even more so when she collected seven ARIA Awards later that month and barely mentioned him in her profuse thank yous.\n\n\"I was not thanked properly at the ARIAs,\" Wheatley said in November. \"That's a fact. And that didn't go unnoticed by the entire f---ing music industry. One cursory throwaway line: 'Thanks, Glenn.' Who was that? Was that a Glenn? Was that the manicurist?\" Goodrem's seeming ingratitude was the first blemish on her spotless public record, but in July 2004 she notched up a second in a messy legal battle with another early supporter. Melbourne recording house Studio 52 and its associated label Empire Records sued Goodrem and her parents for the right to release recordings of her that they had made in 1999-2000, with owners Trevor Carter and Paul Higgins claiming they had a contractual agreement that predated Goodrem's Sony deal.\n\nWheatley had sent Goodrem to Studio 52 in 1999 to record demo material with Carter and Higgins. Together they assembled a 13-track album of disposable pop, mostly written by Carter. When no record label showed any interest, Empire signed Goodrem to a recording contract of its own. \"Wheatley effectively parked her at Studio 52,\" says a former recording engineer who preferred not to be named. \"When she was signed to Empire, it was purely and simply a parking exercise, waiting for something better to come along – which it did with Sony. None of the stuff she did at Studio 52 has ever seen the light of day, mostly because it's all rubbish.\"\n\n\"She was being pushed in a direction that I don't think she really wanted to go in,\" says Helen Aldridge, a Studio 52 office manager during Goodrem's time there. \"They were pushing her to be the next Britney Spears, they wanted to dress her in skimpy little clothes and put her out there as a sex object, and it just wasn't Delta. She could have been made into a Britney-type character, but she wasn't into it.\"\n\nHiggins and Carter claimed that they took an unformed, inexperienced girl and turned her into a marketable performer, and that their contract entitled them to a percentage of the royalties from Goodrem's subsequent recordings. The case was eventually settled in mediation, with Carter and Higgins receiving an unspecified payout in return for undertaking not to release the earlier recordings.\n\nJust as that case was being settled in October 2004, Goodrem's relationship with Australian tennis pin-up Mark Philippoussis came to a sudden end. The two had met while Goodrem was still recovering from cancer treatment, after Philippoussis sent her flowers and a get-well card. In public everything was roses and romance for nine months, and Goodrem's hit Out Of The Blue was a heartfelt profession of her love for The Scud. But then millionaire heiress Paris Hilton mentioned to a couple of Australians – winners of a Los Angeles shopping spree – that she was having a fling with the tennis star. What's more, Hilton reportedly claimed that Philippoussis had told her Goodrem was \"boring\".\n\nGoodrem insists she had no prior knowledge that her relationship was in trouble. \"(We broke up) because I read on the front page of the papers about Paris Hilton and Mark,\" she said in her 60 Minutes interview last week.\n\nThe ensuing media frenzy at least provided Goodrem with the inspiration for Electric Storm, a Mistaken Identity album track. Her previous relationships – with Glenn Wheatley's son Tim and with Sydney Swans footballer Jude Bolton – had never attracted quite so much attention. \"There was a lot going on in the media about my love life, and I'd never had that before,\" she says on the DVD that comes with the special edition of the album. \"All of a sudden it was getting me really down, and I started to feel a lot of pressure from other things that were being said, and all of a sudden I felt like, 'This is like I'm in a thunderstorm right now, this is really just crazy'.\"\n\nAll in all, 2004 was a year filled with heartache and pain for a star who might have had reason to expect a fair amount of joy. \"There was a lot of betrayal; a lot of people really surprised me,\" Goodrem said last December. \"I saw a lot of different colours in people that I had never seen before, so I guess that was a big growing experience. I learnt from that, and from a lot of different things that happened – all the situations, the betrayals, the story of the management, everything.\"\n\nBy year's end, though, Goodrem was finding solace in the arms of 24-year-old Irish singer Brian McFadden, a former member of boyband Westlife, and with whom Goodrem had written and recorded the duet Almost Here. But even there, she was not safe from controversy. McFadden had only recently broken up with his wife – and mother of their two children – Kerry Katona (from UK girl group Atomic Kitten), and her fans believed there may have been some crossover in their relationships. Last month some even went so far as to send Goodrem threatening letters accusing her of breaking up the marriage, and when McFadden and Goodrem appeared at an Irish charity concert to sing Almost Here, they were booed off stage.\n\nThe scarlet woman is just the most recent of the many contrasting portraits of Delta Goodrem that have been painted over the past two years. From the innocent ingenue to the blameless cancer victim, then on to the ruthless ingrate, the spurned lover and finally the home-wrecker – it's quite a list for someone who is still only 20 years old. Goodrem's own personality, though, seems to have disappeared under the weight of public perception, making the simple question \"Who is Delta Goodrem?\" very difficult to answer.\n\nHer Hating Alison Ashley co-star, 20-year-old Saskia Burmeister, who plays the main role of Erica Yurken, believes the original image of Goodrem still comes closest to the real person she knows. \"We'd sit in our trailers and just read girlie magazines and eat lunch and have a great time,\" she says of the three months they spent together last year making the movie. \"She had a wonderful smile and zest, she'd always give me a big hug in the morning in the make-up bus, and hold my hand as we walked down the steps, just to make sure that I was comfortable. She's an incredibly caring girl.\"\n\nEven those who might have less reason to be complimentary see Goodrem as basically sweet and likeable. \"Personally I think Delta's music is terrible, but herself as a person I really liked,\" says Helen Aldridge. \"She was one of those kids who would have been doing it since she was five in the local talent contest, that kind of kid, really driven to perform, whether it be acting, dancing, singing. She was a girly girl, she loved that kind of stuff.\" Aldridge's unnamed Studio 52 colleague shares her feelings about Goodrem. \"She was a sweet girl and my impression is that she still is a sweet girl,\" he says.\n\nBurmeister sees the parallel between Goodrem's slightly vapid, wide-eyed public demeanour and that of her movie character Alison Ashley, but believes there is an underlying strength of character that most people do not get to see. \"I think that, on the page, Alison Ashley is innocent and she has this kind of reserved nature, and Delta gave her that,\" she says. \"But she also gave her a strength and, for lack of a better word, a kind of power. Alison is very strong in herself, and I think Delta has that in her countenance anyway. You have to be strong to survive in this industry.\"\n\nAlthough Goodrem is only a few months Burmeister's senior, her experience with the media made her a kind of surrogate big sister for the younger actor. \"On the set of Hating Alison Ashley Delta and I had our first interview ever for a film, and I'm such a babe in the woods about it all, I knocked on her door and walked in and went, 'Hi Delta'. She was there playing the piano ... or something, and I'm like, 'Hey, so, with the press, what do I do?' And she was like, 'Come sit down, and I'll talk to you about it'. She gave me a little bit of a pep talk, which was very encouraging.\"\n\nBurmeister refuses to divulge what Goodrem's advice was for dealing with the media. \"If I tell you,\" she jokes, then you'll be able to get around it\". But whatever Goodrem knew about the media in May last year, when filming for Hating Alison Ashley was completed, you can be sure she's learnt a lot more since. And you can also be sure that not much of it has been good.\n\nDELTA – A TIMELINE\n\n1984\n\nBorn November 9 in Sydney to parents Lea and Denis. Named after the Joe Cocker song Delta Lady.
