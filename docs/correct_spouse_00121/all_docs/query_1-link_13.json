        "text": "I hope he has some kind of really public breakdown,the man is slime,treated Kerry appalingly,deserted his kids,then slagged off their Mum in the press when she hit rock bottom,which only happened after he left her,she obviously needed help,and he was happy to swan off to Australia to be with someone else and leave his children in an unsavoury environment filled with drugs and possible neglect.\n\nAs for everyone who says Delta is better off without him,she is not exactly blameless,she was happy to start up with a married man,and leave two vulnerable little girls without their Daddy!!!\n\nWhen affairs happen,its the married one who is in the wrong,but just because she had no partner to hurt and crap on,doesn't make her totally innocent!\n\nVery well said Kira.\n\nI would just like to add that back in 2004, whilst Kerry was still in the jungle, i read reports that Brian McFathead had flown out to Oz in the latter stages of the show, ready to be there to greet his wife (who, as we know became the eventual winner). It was during this time that there were conflicting reports as to how he came to 'lose' his wedding ring. Some said it was accidentally lost whilst swimming in the sea, whilst others claimed he had deliberately removed it and thrown it into the sea, declaring his marriage was over. I have always had my suspicions that Delta was already waiting in the wings at this point and despite him playing the role of 'the proud husband' when Kerry won IAC, he was already making plans to dump her and their two little girls for Delta. As far as i recall, they did split shortly after.\n\nI'd be interested to know if anyone else remembers having similar suspicions to mine around that time?\n\n0\n\nI never thought i would be [sort of] defending a sometimes arrogant, self centered twonk like Brian McFadden!\n\nIts shocking people are defending Katona! Brian is no angle, but the sympathetic posts on here for Katona...CAN must be rubbing their hands with glee. I mean lets be honest this break up has given her the perfect opportunity to play the \"single mother\" routine. She already begged him to contact the children yadar yadar\n\nIsnt it somewhat hypocritical to call Brian out in the press to see his children now, whilst at the same time slamming Mark for wanting to see his? I'm confused!! Oh i remember now...everythings Marks fault this month!\n\nSeriously all the comments about Brian and Kerrys split! Was he really expected to stay unhappily married to Kerry for his children? If anything, growing up in a toxic environment with two unhappy parents would have been more damaging for his girls. And as much as people dislike the fact he left the UK for Delta, they've lasted 7 years together. And so far have nothing but nice things to say about each other. Where as Kerrys recent Ex is busy in the UK being portrayed by CAN as the devil, whilst at the same time CAN are trying to reproduced the same formula for her that worked so great for Peter Andre after his split!\n\nPeople seem to forget she's been defending Mark that dead beat slob for years, had his children and then tried to blame him for EVERYTHING she became unpopular for. No wonder Brian wanted out of her circus, she was demonising him before he left too. I remember Brians chat with Frank Skinner shortly after his break up with Kerry, and he was asked if he left her because he lost weight and got a hair cut?! I mean seriously?!! That how bias the press were at the time. Looking back people had no idea what she was like! Its really harsh but when his girls grow up, it wouldnt suprise me if they blamed Kerry for driving him away. The power of the interest, see. All that shit she said about him...\n\nBesides its been reported Brian McFadden tried several times to get custody of his girls. The last time he failed, was shortly after the video of Kerry powdering her nose came to light! So as much as people are calling him selfish for moving, i think she's just as selfish for not GIVING him custody...at least whilst she got her shit together!.\n\nI mean its such a sad cliche, but nobody really knows what went on behind closed doors with Kerry and Brian. Especially given Katona's antics behind closed doors with Mark Croft!\n\nI think Katona should keep her publicity seeking self out of this one....but she wont! :yawn:\n\n0"
