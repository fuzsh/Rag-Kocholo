        "text": "Kate Waterhouse fired a few curly questions at the former Westlife member and Australia's Got Talent judge before the Lexus Celebrity Challenge at the Australian Grand Prix. Did he really cause an incident on board an international flight? Why does he keep getting into trouble? And why hasn't he married Delta yet?\n\nWhat's happening with your album?\n\nI've got a single coming out in another few weeks but I've just taken a breather after my new song was lifted off radio because some journalist wrote that it was promoting date rape. It was the most ridiculous thing and I laughed it off but it got to the stage where people jumped on the bandwagon, so I had to pull the song.\n\nI read you had trouble with the police.\n\nI don't know, apparently I smoked in the plane toilets and abused all the economy passengers.\n\nSo what happened?\n\nNothing. I don't know how it started because they interviewed nearly everyone on the plane and every single person said nothing happened but for some reason the story stuck.\n\nYou seem to have a bad boy reputation.\n\nIn what way am I a bad boy? Because I like a drink? I just have fun and enjoy myself. Life is too short to sit back and worry, so I've just got to the stage in my life where I enjoy it because we could be dead next week.\n\nDelta seems to be the total opposite.\n\nWe are definitely chalk and cheese; she doesn't drink or go out and I do and I smoke. We definitely live two different lives but I think that's why we work so well.\n\nIs there any pressure to set a wedding date?\n\nI'm not getting pressure from anybody. It's more just other people asking all the time, \"when are you getting married?\" It's as simple as this: we just haven't sent a date yet.\n\nWill the wedding be in Australia?\n\nWe haven't even talked about it. It definitely won't be in Ireland or England and probably won't be in the US, it's more likely to be in Australia.\n\nHow do you cope living in different countries?\n\nWhenever we have an album out this always happens because we have got to go on different time schedules for promotion but the past two years, because we were making our records, we were together for most of it.\n\nWill you make more music together?\n\nNo. We didn't on this record because we ventured into two different styles. We did a lot together on the last record because Delta was starting to veer more into pop - I was veering more to that as well - and were meeting in the middle.\n\nDo you spend much time with your kids?\n\nNot as much as I would like but I've flown them to LA a couple of times and I try to go back to England, where they are, at least every two months but it's been hard the past couple of months because it's been so busy with Australia's Got Talent.\n\nAre you and Kyle Sandilands close?\n\nYes, we are best mates. He is a good guy and I feel sorry for him because he gets a bad rap.\n\nBite size\n\nWE WENT TO: Broadford Racetrack, Melbourne.\n\nWE DROVE: Lexus CT200h.\n\nBRIAN WORE: A car-racing suit."
