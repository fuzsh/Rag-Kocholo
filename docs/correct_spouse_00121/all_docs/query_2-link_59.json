        "text": "Singer Delta Goodrem says her relationship with Irish singer Brian McFadden was a friendship that turned into something else, and she's in love.\n\nGoodrem spoke to ABC Radio today about the bad publicity she had received in Britain over her relationship with the recently separated McFadden, formerly of boy band Westlife.\n\nThe audience of an awards show in Ireland had vocally sided with McFadden's wife Kerry Katona, who was in the band Atomic Kitten, by chanting her name and booing the Australian singer.\n\n\"To be portrayed in a way sometimes that is nothing like you over there, like I was in the UK, it can be really personal,\" Goodrem said.\n\nThe songstress said she was surprised people were even interested in her relationships.\n\n\"I haven't had many relationships you know,\" she said.\n\n\"I'm still really very young and I guess I am still learning how to kind of cope with it myself.\n\n\"I don't know how to do relationships or anything. I am just doing music and talking to people yet I guess I am sort of learning everyday.\"\n\nWhen asked if she was in love with McFadden, Goodrem said: \"I am. I am very happy.\"\n\nGoodrem brought McFadden home to Sydney last week where the couple attended the MTV awards and sang their duet Almost Here.\n\nGoodrem, who had a very public split from ex-boyfriend and tennis star Mark Philippoussis, said the media \"can be awful\"."
