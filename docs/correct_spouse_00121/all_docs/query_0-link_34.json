        "text": "Delta Goodrem and Brian McFadden have pushed back their wedding until 2009 as both singers spend this year focused on their careers.\n\nThe couple, who became engaged late last year, had originally hoped to marry this year.\n\nBut they will spend much of this year apart, with Goodrem in America for months at a time trying to crack the US market, and McFadden travelling in support of his second solo album, Set In Stone.\n\n\"Next year's the wedding,\" McFadden said.\n\n\"We've had three years together every single day, and I think that whole three years was preparing for this year apart.\n\n\"It's been hard but because we're so prepared for it we knew we'd just work hard this year and try to set up the rest of our life.\"\n\nSet In Stone is released tomorrow, the result of two-and-a-half years' work for McFadden.\n\nThe 28-year-old wrote 150 songs for the album, with 10 finding their way onto the record.\n\n\"When I'm in writing mode I pretty much write every single day,\" McFadden explained.\n\n\"As I wrote I went through a period of writing rock songs for a couple of months, and then pop songs, and dance songs and all different kinds of songs.\n\n\"By the end I just kind of had the best ones from each genre, because I wanted every track to be something different ... to keep me from getting bored.\"\n\nMcFadden said most of the songs are autobiographical, but since his last album, Irish Son, that is not so obvious because he is better at disguising their meaning a little.\n\n\"I didn't really leave much to the imagination in the lyrics (on Irish Son), so this time I wanted to make sure people wouldn't judge me from the words,\" he said.\n\n\"I wrote the lyrics in the way that they could have three or four different meanings.\n\n\"If people ask me I'll just say make up your own mind.\"\n\nHowever, McFadden readily admits Like Only A Woman Can is about Goodrem.\n\nThe entire album is dedicated to his fiancee, whom he credits with having a \"massive\" influence on him, musically.\n\n\"I didn't really want to write songs or perform any more and she just kind of dragged me out of that box,\" he said.\n\n\"She breathed a lot of confidence into me as well, which I never had.\"\n\nWhile he is a star in his own right in the UK from his days in the Irish boy band Westlife, in Australia McFadden is better known for being Mr Delta Goodrem.\n\nHe doesn't get sick of talking about her, but would like to be recognised primarily for his music.\n\n\"It can be a little frustrating at times,\" he said.\n\n\"I did something last night where they introduced me as Delta Goodrem's boyfriend Brian McFadden.\n\nAAP"
