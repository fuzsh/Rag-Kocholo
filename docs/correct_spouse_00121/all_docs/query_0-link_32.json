        "text": "After hearing our favourite boy band hunk, Brian McFadden, has officially swapped the mic for a pair of ice-skates for this season of ITV's Dancing on Ice, we thought we would take a closer look at the iconic Irish star and his infamous dating past since Westlife shot to fame.\n\nThe star has been divorced twice, engaged once, and is currently in a relationship with what sources close to him believe is 'the one'.\n\nSo who are the lucky ladies Brian has dated?\n\nVogue Williams\n\nBrian tied the knot to Irish model Vogue Williams back in 2012. Their marriage lasted 3 years.\n\nThey announced the shock split in 2015, when Brian posted a statement on his Twitter and Instagram page.\n\n\"It is with sadness that Vogue and I have made the tough decision to go our separate ways.\n\n\"We will always care greatly about each other, remain friends and wish each other all the very best for the future.\n\n\"We have nothing else to say on the subject and we would like to thank our friends and family for their support during this difficult period. Brian x' wrote the star.\n\nBrian recently revealed he and Vogue, who is now happily married and recently welcomed a baby with Spencer Matthews, did not stay in contact after the break-up.\n\nSpeaking to Closer Magazine, Brian said: \"I don't speak to Vogue any more either.\n\n\"It's pointless. She's married now and is having a baby.\"\n\nWhile the former couple did not have any children together they did share a dog, Winston.\n\nAt the time of their divorce, Brian confessed the thing he misses the most from their three-year marriage is their dog - who was in Vogues care at the time.\n\n\"Not getting to see the dog is the worst part of it. Winston was my best mate and we wouldn't leave each other's sides.\"\n\nKerry Katona\n\nBrian has two children from his marriage to former Atomic Kitten singer Kerry Katona , tying the knot in County Meath, Ireland back in 2002.\n\nThe pair welcomed their first daughter Molly in 2001, before Lilly-Sue came along two years later in 2003.\n\nBrian and Kerry filed for divorce in 2004, claiming Brian's infidelity was at the core of their problems.\n\n“The day my marriage ended was on the stag night (when he cheated on Katona with a lap dancer). That was the time I felt ‘this is not supposed to be’,\" said Brian in an interview with Reveal Magazine.\n\nThe divorce was finalised in 2006.\n\nDespite having problems in the past, Brian has reportedly maintained a healthy relationship with Kerry for the sake of their children. In an interview with OK! Magazine, Kerry said that they still keep in touch and they enjoy a good relationship together.\n\n\"We had a really good phone conversation not long ago where we were properly giggling,\" explained the reality tv star.\n\n\"If I picked up the phone, he’d be there for me,\" she added.\n\nDelta Goodrem\n\nBrian began dating Delta Goodrem in 2004, following his split from Kerry.\n\nDelta is a singer, but is most-known for her role as Nina Tucker in the long-running Australian soap Neighbours.\n\nBrian dated the Australian beauty for seven years, and the pair were even engaged before ending their relationship in 2011.\n\n\"This decision has been made with a lot of soul searching from both parties with the realisation that they have grown apart,\" said the ex-lover's in a statement released at the time.\n\nDanielle Parkinson\n\nThe boyband heart-throb is currently off the market, with current girlfriend, Danielle Parkinson, stealing the key to his heart.\n\nDanielle is a 38-year-old PE teacher from Greater Manchester, England.\n\nApparently, Brian has fallen \"seriously in love\" with the blonde bombshell, after they were pictured together at a golfing event in Dublin in September 2016.\n\nEx-wife Kerry recently told OK! Magazine that her and Brian's daughters, Molly (17) and Lily-Sue (15), hope their father marries Danielle.\n\n\"Molly and Lilly weren’t as close to Delta or Vogue but they are desperate for Brian to marry Danielle,\" she told OK Magazine.\n\n\"I might even get invited to this wedding. Danielle is an absolute diamond.”"
