        "text": "Kyle Sandilands has shared a shocking revelation about Delta Goodrem and her ex-partner that took place inside the radio star’s home.\n\nWhile discussing co-host Jackie ‘O’ Henderson’s sex life, Sandilands brought up a questionable act he claimed he witnessed his friends Brian McFadden and Delta Goodrem did during their relationship.\n\nThe KIIS FM host alleged he saw the couple “spit” into each other’s mouths in his living room while they were dating.\n\n“They’d just spit in each other’s mouths and giggle,” he said.\n\n“I was like... ‘you’re in my lounge room what’s going on here’... it was like Travis Barker and that old Kardashian,” he added.\n\nMcFadden and Goodrem met in 2004 when he asked her to duet with him on their song, Almost Here.\n\nThe couple announced their engagement in 2007 but split four years later in 2011.\n\nAt the time McFadden was still married to reality TV star Kerry Katona, the mother of his two children, although they had separated and the song was about their break up.\n\nSandilands’ claim comes after he and Henderson signed a record-breaking $200 million 10-year contract which will see them on the air for the next decade and expand out of Sydney into Melbourne.\n\nThe radio duo both have mixed opinions on how the Melbournians will take to their first breakfast show on April 29.\n\n“I don’t really think it’ll be an issue at all. I hope they embrace us quickly. But Jackie feels it might be more of a slow burn, but she’s always on the more cautious side of life,” Sandilands told Daily Mail Australia."
