        "text": "Brian McFadden has got married after tying the knot with Irish DJ Vogue Williams in a romantic ceremony at the Castello of Vincigliata in Florence, Italy.\n\nThe former Westlife singer tied the knot with Irish DJ Vogue Williams in a romantic ceremony at the Castello of Vincigliata in Florence, Italy, yesterday (02.09.12).\n\nWhile the details of the nuptials have been kept quiet, Brian’s daughters from his first marriage to Kerry Katona – Molly, 11, and nine-year-old Lilly-Sue – acted as bridesmaids.\n\nThe ceremony in Florence comes days after the couple reportedly made their union official at a Dublin registry office in front of a small crowd of friends and family.\n\nGuests at the Italian wedding included Brian’s ‘Australia’s Got Talent’ co-judge Dannii Minogue and they were treated to a five-course meal, followed by a band, guest DJ and a fireworks display.\n\nBrian – who was previously engaged to singer Delta Goodrem – was very excited about the wedding and had been tweeting about the nuptials all week long.\n\nLast week, he wrote: “Look out Italy the Irish and the Aussies are coming in hot!!!!!!!! (sic)”\n\nYesterday he tweeted: “I’m getting married today. #justsayin.”\n\nBrian, 32, and 26-year-old Vogue have been dating since May 2011, and their engagement was announced in January."
