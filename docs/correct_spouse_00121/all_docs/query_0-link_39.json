        "text": "A representative of pop princess Delta Goodrem has denied a report the singer is engaged to Irish boyfriend Brian McFadden.\n\nBritish newspaper The News of the World reported that Goodrem was planning to wed McFadden, who was once in boy band Westlife.\n\nA representative from Goodrem's record label, Sony BMG, said today as far as she knew there was \"definitely\" no truth to the report.\n\nMeanwhile, a Sydney newspaper reported today that Goodrem's mother Lea had also slammed the rumour.\n\nGoodrem, 20 and McFadden, 25, met mid last year when they recorded their hit duet Almost Here.\n\nAt the time, McFadden was splitting with his wife, TV presenter and former Atomic Kitten singer Kerry McFadden, while Goodrem's relationship with tennis star Mark Philippoussis was starting to crumble.\n\nThe pair did not get together romantically until Christmas when they performed at the Royal Variety Show in London.\n\n- AAP"
