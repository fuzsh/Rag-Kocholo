Brian and her were on speaking terms for a while but not now.\n\n\"She's determined to draw out the divorce and take Brian for everything he's worth.\n\n\"She's been talking to lawyers and won't let Brian walk all over her when it comes to sorting their money, possessions and access to the kids.\n\n\"The way she sees it, if Brian had been honest with her about seeing Delta then that's one thing, but to lie about it is betraying her again.\"\n\nBrian admitted he is in love with the singer and they recently returned from a holiday together in South Africa.\n\nKerry checked in to the Priory clinic again last week for depression since the news of Brian and Delta's relationship came out.\n\nOver the past month, the couple had been talking on the phone and meeting with their daughters Molly, three and 23-month-old Lilly Sue.\n\nBut at the weekend Brian claimed their relationship could have survived if Kerry hadn't rushed into a relationship with ex-boyfriend Dan Corsi.\n\nHe also claimed Kerry had bombarded him with calls boasting she had \"been with\" Robbie Williams.\n\np.martin@ mgn.co.uk\n\nCAPTION(S):\n\nBITTER: Kerry and Brian's split is becoming nasty and will end up in court"
