        "text": "Brian McFadden's marriage to Kerry Katona was meant to be the pop match made in heaven, after they had met on the Smash Hits tour in 1999, but it never really worked out that way.\n\nBrian was singing with Westlife while Kerry was a star in Atomic Kitten and they tied the knot at the Church of the Immaculate Conception at Rathfeigh, Ireland, followed by a 250-strong star-studded reception at Slane Castle, on January 5, 2002.\n\nThe Irish singer, who turns 41 today, has admitted that their relationship had shown cracks before they had married and that a heartbreaking phone call brought it to an end.\n\nBrian had said that after joining Westlife aged 19, he had only ever kissed one other woman before meeting Kerry.\n\nHe said that her falling in love with him was \"overwhelming\" and that he felt that he needed to act upon this without really considering the long-term implications of being betrothed to each other.\n\nSpeaking to the Independent in 2007, Brian said: \"I was very young when I met her and no one ever loved me before. So when Kerry came along and wanted me, that gap was filled and I felt good simply because I had someone to share everything with.\n\n\"I never stopped to think, 'You really should get to know this person before you have kids, think of marrying or settle down.'\n\n\"So then, when we had the first baby, bought a house, spent time together and Westlife became the same thing over and over, I woke up one morning and realised, 'This is not what I want to do with my life, I don't see myself being with this woman in 20 years, she's not who I'm meant to be with, we don't have anything in common.'\"\n\nBy the time they split in 2004, Brian and Kerry had had two daughters, Molly and Lilly-Sue, who are now 19 and 17.\n\nThe moment their marriage came to an abrupt halt was during a tense phone call in which Brian admitted he didn't love Kerry any more.\n\nHe has maintained that the decision to split was mutual, but Kerry has insisted she begged him to stay.\n\nBrian has since said that the marriage was never going to work as he had already cheated on Kerry before they had tied the knot.\n\nHe said that he had a moment with a lapdancer while on his stag do, and that was when he realised that he wasn't fully committed to the relationship with Kerry.\n\nHe said: \"That stag night story started our marriage off badly and if I'm to be completely honest, the day my marriage ended was that stag night, before I even got married.\n\n\"That was the time I felt, 'This is not supposed to be'. That was the first crack and everyone saw it.\"\n\nKerry found out these details in a newspaper, some six months later, and she was devastated by the reveal.\n\nSpeaking to the now defunct News of the World at the time, Kerry said: \"That killed it for me. I loved Brian and I trusted him. I remember thinking: 'But he's the fat one from Westlife. Why would he do this to me?'\"\n\nBrian moved on with Australian singer Delta Goodrem after the split from Kerry.\n\nHe had met Delta when they came together for his solo single, Almost Here.\n\nKerry has since said that if she had not appeared on Loose Women and accepted Brian's invitation to join them in the recording studio, their lives may have taken a wholly different path.\n\nShe said: \"It was always my Brian this and that, and then one day Brian said to me, 'I’m recording a new single with someone called Deltra Goodrem- come with me', and I was like 'I can’t come I’m on Loose Women'. Imagine if I didn’t I’d still be married...\"\n\nIt wasn't meeting Delta that was the issue in truth, Kerry has mused, saying: \"If someone falls out of love with you there’s nothing you can do.\""
