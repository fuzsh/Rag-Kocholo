        "text": "Delta Goodrem has been seen in public for the first time since extraordinary claims were made about her and ex Brian McFadden.\n\nThe Australian singer, 39, performed to a crowd of 1,000 fans alongside Fifi, Fev & Nick for their Brekky In The Burbs live event. She took to the stage in Melbourne and performed three tacks for the crowd. Delta looked stylish in a grey jacket and added chunky gold hoop earrings as she belted out her biggest hits.\n\nHer performance marked the first time she'd been seen in public since radio presenter Kyle Sandilands made claims about her and her Westlife ex boyfriend. He alleged he saw the couple \"spit\" into each other's mouths. \"They'd just spit in each other's mouths and giggle,\" he claimed. \"I was like... 'you're in my lounge room what's going on here'... it was like Travis Barker and [Kourtney] Kardashian.\"\n\nDelta and Brian met back in 2004 when he asked her to duet on the song, Almost Here. The Westlife singer was still married to Kerry Katona at the time, who he shares daughter Molly, 22, and Lilly-Sue, 21, with. They had separated and the song was about their break-up.\n\nBrian moved on with Delta and they became engaged in 2007. However, four years later they called it quits. Kerry and Brian were married from 2002 until 2006. The Atomic Kitten star has since said that if she had not appeared on Loose Women and accepted Brian's invitation to join them in the recording studio, their lives may have taken a wholly different path.\n\nShe said: \"It was always my Brian this and that, and then one day Brian said to me, 'I’m recording a new single with someone called Deltra Goodrem- come with me', and I was like 'I can’t come I’m on Loose Women'. Imagine if I didn’t I’d still be married...\" Kerry confessed: \"If someone falls out of love with you there’s nothing you can do.\"\n\nBrian found love with Vogue Williams in 2012 following his split from Delta, however they divorced three years later. He is now dating PE teacher Danielle Parkinson after meeting through mutual friends. The pair welcomed their first daughter Ruby in 2021 via IVF after revealing they had gone through two miscarriages.\n\nFormer Neighbours star Delta is also loved up as she announced her engagement to long-term boyfriend Matthew Copley last year. Alongside a stunning photo of her and Matthew sharing a kiss, she wrote: \"My best friend asked me to marry him.\" Delta likes to keep her relationship with Matthew private, as they never make red carpet events together. The actress-turned-singer shot to fame in the UK as bad girl Nina Tucker on Neighbours between 2002 and 2005 before making a brief return in 2015. Her hit Born To Try went on to reach number three in the UK charts. Delta also dated Jonas Brothers singer Nick Jonas briefly when he was a teenager before they called time on their short-lived romance in 2012.\n\nThe Mirror has contacted Delta and Brian's representatives for comment."
