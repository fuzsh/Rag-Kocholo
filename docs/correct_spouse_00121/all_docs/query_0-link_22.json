        "text": "Kyle Sandilands made a wild claim about Delta Goodrem on Monday’s The Kyle and Jackie O Show.\n\nDuring a discussion about his co-star’s sex life, Sandilands brought up his pal Goodrem, and alleged that he’d once seen the singer engage in a wild act with her ex-husband, Brian McFadden.\n\nSandilands claimed that he once saw the couple “spit” into each other’s mouths at his home while they were dating.\n\n“They’d just spit in each other’s mouths and giggle,” he claimed. “I was like … ‘you’re in my lounge room what’s going on here’ … it was like Travis Barker and that old Kardashian.”\n\nnews.com.au has reached out to Goodrem for comment.\n\nGoodrem began dating former Westlife singer Brian McFadden after her split from former tennis player Mark Philippoussis – and it was arguably her most public relationship to date.\n\nThe pair – who collaborated on the hit single Almost Here – dated for seven years and even got engaged during that time.\n\nTheir relationship was not without controversy as when they first started dating, the Irish singer had only just broken up with Kerry Katona, his wife and mother of their two children, who was much loved in the UK for being in the girl group Atomic Kitten.\n\nMany fans believed there may have been an overlap between the end of his marriage and his relationship with Goodrem, who was painted as a “homewrecker” in the UK tabloids.\n\nThey split in 2011 and released this joint statement: “This decision has been made with a lot of soul searching from both parties with the realisation that they have grown apart.”\n\nIn a later interview with Vogue, Goodrem touched on their doomed romance.\n\n“There is so much I’d like to say. I was really unhappy and I didn’t know how to get out. I learnt. I got there in the end,” she said.\n\nGoodrem is now happily dating musician Matthew Copley and the pair are engaged to be married.\n\n“I made a conscious decision when I was 30 that I’m not somebody who wants to talk about relationships,” she told InStyle Australia in 2018.\n\n“I made a [choice] that I’m not even going to comment ‘yes’ or ‘no’ … I’ve said nothing for three or four years — all I’ve kept saying is ‘I’m single and I’ll let you know when I’m in a serious relationship.’ And I will.”"
