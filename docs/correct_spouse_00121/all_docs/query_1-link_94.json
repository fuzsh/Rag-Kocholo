And I will.\"\n\nGoodrem's new approach comes after a string of high profile romances, with the singer becoming engaged to Irish pop star Brian McFadden before splitting in 2011 after a seven-year romance.\n\nShe also dated tennis star Mark Philippoussis as a teenager and enjoyed a 10-month romance with Nick Jonas before splitting in 2012."
