        "text": "IT'S been more than a year since they split - but now Delta Goodrem is now finally opening up about her relationship with Australia's Got Talent judge Brian McFadden.\n\nIn the July issue of Vogue Australia, Goodrem says: \"There is so much I’d like to say. I was really unhappy and I didn’t know how to get out. I learnt. I got there in the end.\"\n\nGoodrem, who is a judge on the rival talent show The Voice, dated McFadden for seven years and the pair were engaged to be married. They first met when McFadden was still married to Atomic Kitten singer Kerry Katona.\n\nWhen Goodrem and McFadden announced their split last year, they said they made the decision after a lot of \"soul searching\" but they realised they had been growing apart.\n\nHowever, friends of Goodrem blamed McFadden's insecurities for the relationship hitting the rocks.\n\nThey said McFadden had found life difficult in Delta's golden shadow and had struggled to balance her popularity and the public's perception of him as a reckless bad boy.\n\n\"In some ways, it was hard for him to be the back seat to the Delta Show,\" one said.\n\n\"No one could live up to that expectation.\"\n\nMcFadden is now engaged to Irish model Vogue Williams. Goodrem had a brief relationship with the youngest Jonas brother, Nick. She admits that her affair with the much younger singer was a case of rebounding from one extreme to another. \"But I only have good things to say about Nick,\" she tells Vogue Australia.\n\nThe July issue of Vogue Australia goes on sale on June 6.\n\nPictures: Vogue Australia"
