        "text": "From the years of 2004 to 2011, Australia was eagerly waiting for the wedding of golden couple Delta Goodrem and Brian McFadden.\n\nGoodrem, now 33, had spent the majority of her career as one of Australia’s highest-selling pop artists, and her fiancé McFadden was an ex-member of Irish boyband Westlife, before beginning a successful solo career of his own.\n\nHowever in 2011, the pair announced that they were calling off their engagement, and while Goodrem has remained in the public eye, McFadden’s presence has been a bit more patchy.\n\nMcFadden, 38 and from Dublin, Ireland, first re-appeared in the Australian media after Goodrem’s 2012 interview with Vogue Australia, which shed a negative light over their relationship.\n\n“There is so much I’d like to say. I was really unhappy and I didn’t know how to get out. I learned. I got there in the end,” she told the publication.\n\nMcFadden retaliated through a Twitter rant.\n\n“Sometimes silence is golden. People love to try and deflect attention from their own downfalls onto others,” he wrote.\n\n“And for the record. I’ve seen it all before!! Randomly want to thank (then fiancée) Vogue Williams for making me the happiest man on the planet.”\n\nIn 2012 the musician married DJ Vogue Williams after dating for about a year. They celebrated their marriage in an elaborate Tuscan ceremony, before announcing their divorce three years later on Twitter.\n\nDespite this, things seemed to have ended amicably and in his message to fans he made sure to specify that they will continue to care for each other.\n\n“It is with sadness that Vogue and I have made the tough decision to go our separate ways,\" he wrote.\n\n“We will always care greatly about each other, remain friends and we wish each other all the very best for the future.\"\n\nCurrently, McFadden is dating Danielle Parkinson - a PE teacher from Rochdale in the UK's Greater Manchester region.\n\nIn an exclusive from The Sun, a source said that they had met through mutual friends around November of 2016, and from the looks of his Instagram, their relationship is still going strong.\n\nCareer wise, McFadden is a regular on local celebrity reality TV shows inbetween touring.\n\nTop of his TV resume includes participating on dancing show Stepping Out with his ex-wife Williams in 2013 and co-hosting dating show Stand By Your Man and celebrity cooking show Who's Doing the Dishes in 2014.\n\nOne of his more random pursuits include competing on the British reality TV show The Jump in 2016 which followed celebrities trying to master various winter sports like bob sleighing and snow skating. He was the fourth celebrity to be eliminated from the show.\n\nIn 2016 he also returned to his boy band roots collaborating with ex Boyzone singer Keith Duffy under the name Boyzlife. Together they toured the UK singing hits from from their respective boy bands and sharing stories from their respective careers."
