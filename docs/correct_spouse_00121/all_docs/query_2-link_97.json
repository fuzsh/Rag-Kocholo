        "text": "Brian McFadden is set to marry for the third time after proposing to girlfriend Danielle Parkinson.\n\nThe former Westlife star announced the news on Twitter, writing: ‘FYI I got engaged t beautiful @DaniParky. And yes I’m very very happy xxxx.’\n\nFans and friends filed in with messages of congratulations, with stars including Ola Jordan and Naga Munchetty wishing the happy couple well.\n\nBrian, 39, has been dating PE teacher Danielle since 2016, and met when they were introduced by jazz singer Cole Page.\n\nDanielle previously competed in the hepthathlon at under 21 level, and teaches PE at Matthew Moss High School in Rochdale.\n\nLast night, Brian put on a charity show at the 100 Club in Dublin, but it’s unclear whether he proposed at the show.\n\nThis will be McFadden’s third marriage.\n\nIn 2002, he tied the knot with Kerry Katona in a ceremony in Meath, Ireland, and the couple went on to have two kids together, Molly, 15, and Lilly Sue, 13.\n\nHowever, they filed for divorce in 2004, with the divorce finalised two years later.\n\nBrian then dated Australian singer and actress Delta Goodrem from 2004, and they were engaged before they announced their split in 2011.\n\nA joint statement read: ‘Delta Goodrem and Brian McFadden regretfully announce that they are no longer engaged, and after much consideration, have mutually decided to end their relationship.\n\n‘This decision has been made with a lot of soul searching from both parties with the realisation that they have grown apart. They leave the partnership with respect for one and other, wishing each other success and happiness for the future.’\n\nIn 2011, Brian met reality star Vogue Williams, and he proposed after eight months.\n\nThe following year they tied the knot in Florence, but three years later, the couple had separated.\n\nVogue has gone on to marry Spencer Matthews, and they welcomed their son Theodore in September 2018.\n\nMORE : Caroline Flack’s boyfriend Lewis Burton insists he’s ‘not a victim’ as body camera footage from 999 call ‘to be used’"
