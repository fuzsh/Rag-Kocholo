        "text": "Delta Goodrem showed up in public following 'disgusting' claims by Brian McFadden. For the first time since sensational gossip about her and her ex, Brian McFadden, broke, 39 year old Delta Goodrem was spotted in sight.\n\nThe acclaimed Australian singer delivered a spirited act for an audience of 1,000 fans at Fifi, Fev and Nick's Brekky In The Burbs live event.\n\nSporting a trendy grey jacket twinned with chunky gold hoop hoops, she performed three mesmerising songs for the crowd in Melbourne, reports the Mirror.\n\nREAD MORE: Glasgow family heartbroken after dad dies weeks after headache turned out to be cancer\n\nREAD MORE: Real Baby Reindeer Martha reveals identity and says 'I did not do jail time'\n\nThis marked her foremost public sighting since the controversial radio presenter Kyle Sandilands aired claims about her erstwhile relationship with the Westlife musician, implying that he saw them \"spit\" into each other's mouths.\n\n\"They'd just spit in each other's mouths and giggle,\" he alleged.\n\n\"I was like... 'you're in my lounge room what's going on here'... it was like Travis Barker and [Kourtney] Kardashian.\n\nIn 2004, when Brian met Delta, he requested her to collaborate on their duet song - Almost Here.\n\nNotably, the Westlife singer was still tied in marriage with Kerry Katona back then, with whom he has two daughters Molly, 22, and Lilly-Sue, 21.\n\nThe pair had separated at the time, and the song is believed to mirror their dissolution.\n\nBrian moved on with Delta and they became engaged in 2007. However, four years later they called it quits. Kerry and Brian were married from 2002 until 2006.\n\nThe Atomic Kitten star has since said that if she had not appeared on Loose Women and accepted Brian's invitation to join them in the recording studio, their lives may have taken a wholly different path.\n\nShe said: \"It was always my Brian this and that, and then one day Brian said to me, 'I'm recording a new single with someone called Deltra Goodrem- come with me', and I was like 'I can't come I'm on Loose Women'. Imagine if I didn't I'd still be married...\"\n\nKerry confessed: \"If someone falls out of love with you there's nothing you can do.\"\n\nBrian found love with Vogue Williams in 2012 following his split from Delta, however, they divorced three years later.\n\nJoin Glasgow Live's WhatsApp community here and get the latest news sent straight to your messages.\n\nHe is now dating PE teacher Danielle Parkinson after meeting through mutual friends.\n\nThe pair welcomed their first daughter Ruby in 2021 via IVF after revealing they had gone through two miscarriages.\n\nFormer Neighbours actress Delta Goodrem joyfully announced her engagement to long-term love, Matthew Copley last year.\n\nThe star shared a stunning photo of the pair locked in a romantic kiss and wrote: \"My best friend asked me to marry him.\"\n\nDelta and Matthew tend to keep their relationship low-key, rarely making appearances together at red carpet events.\n\nSign up to our daily Glasgow Live newsletter here to receive news and features direct to your inbox\n\nDelta made waves in the UK when she took on the role of bad girl Nina Tucker on Neighbours from 2002 to 2005, with a brief return in 2015. Her hit single Born To Try quickly climbed the charts and secured position three in the UK.\n\nIn the past, Delta also had a brief romance with Jonas Brothers singer Nick Jonas, back when he was a teenager, before they decided to end their fleeting romantic endeavour in 2012."
