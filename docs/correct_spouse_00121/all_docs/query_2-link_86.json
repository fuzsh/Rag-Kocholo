        "text": "AUSSIE star Delta Goodrem has got engaged to her longtime partner Matthew Copley.\n\nThe former Neighbours actress, 36, shared her sweet engagement video on Instagram today and fans loved it.\n\nDelta wrote: \"My best friend asked me to marry him\" along with an emoji of a diamond ring.\n\nHe replied: \"My forever love!\" along with a red heart.\n\nA video clip showed a violin quarter playing at a romantic spot overlooking the harbour in Malta at sunset.\n\nAt it ends, she raises her hand to the camera to reveal a huge sparkling diamond ring.\n\nThe star was quickly congratulated by fans, with one telling her: \"You have so long deserved a man who loves you the way he does.\"\n\nDelta, who has dated stars including Nick Jonas and Brian McFadden in the past, has been with Matthew for six years.\n\nThe pair met through her singing career saying in February: \"He's my guitarist, I met him through music. It's incredible to be on stage with him because he's so talented.\"\n\nShe told the Australian Women's Weekly: \"We really are a team. He's my best friend, he's kind and just a beautiful human being.\n\n\"I'm very lucky. It's all very natural and I think that comes from a beautiful respect and love. I feel so grateful.\"\n\nHowever, the couple are rarely seen on the celebrity circuit and never make red-carpet appearances together.\n\nSinger and actress Delta became a huge star in Australia and the UK thanks to appearing as Nina Tucker in Neighbours.\n\nThe daytime soap proved a launchpad for her music career, with her ballad Born To Try reaching No3 in the UK.\n\nShe and Brian met in 2004 when she was just 20 and the ex-Westlife star had split from wife Kerry Katona.\n\nHe had asked the Aussie singer to duet with him for hit song Almost Here after quitting the boyband."
