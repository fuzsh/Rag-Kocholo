        "text": "Irish singer Brian McFadden and his fiancée Delta Goodrem have announced the end of their engagement. McFadden, most notably known for leaving Irish band Westlife to pursue a solo career, proposed to the Australian songbird in 2007 after a three year relationship that was highly publicized in both Ireland and Australia.\n\nMcFadden was previously married to English reality star Kerry Katona, with whom he had two daughters, but separated from her in 2004. Though their divorce was finalized in 2006, McFadden and Goodrem experienced major backlash for their relationship, with gossip circulating that they had been involved while McFadden was still married. Goodrem and McFadden have vehemently denied this claim many times, and permanently moved to Australia in order to avoid the ensuing scandal in Ireland and Britain. Katona, who suffered a public meltdown in the years following her divorce from McFadden, has often blamed him particularly for her issues, taking many of her accusations to the Internet.\n\nMcFadden has not shied away from negative publicity in recent years either, however. In February, he was questioned by Australian police after a bizarre outburst on a flight from Los Angeles to Sydney. Goodrem, who is known for her squeaky clean image, publicly battled Hodgkin’s Lymphoma following the release of her debut album Innocent Eyes in 2003. She has since gone into remission and has sold millions of albums worldwide.\n\nGoodrem and McFadden are seemingly on good terms and there are hints at a possible reconciliation, with McFadden tweeting hours after the announcement of their breakup: “i love delta and always will. She is one of gods (sic) living angels. I thank her for giving me the best years of my life. Please give us time x.”"
