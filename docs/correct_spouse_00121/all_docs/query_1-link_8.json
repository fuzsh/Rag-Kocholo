        "text": "When it comes to matters of the heart, Delta Goodrem always wears her own on her sleeve.\n\nThe 37-year-old Aussie beauty has had an eventful romantic history – and we can’t blame the guys who have eagerly lined up to date the gorgeous star.\n\nAfter she rose to fame in the early 2000s for her acting gig on Neighbours, the blonde bombshell from Ramsay Street became one of the most prominent faces in Australian entertainment, so naturally, her dating life was one of the first things that piqued the interest of her fans.\n\nWATCH: Delta Goodrem says Seal is a flirt. Story continues below…\n\nDuring the 2000s, Delta saw her profile rise not only through her Neighbours gig, but also as a talented singer, releasing her first album Innnocent Eyes in 2003.\n\nThe rest, as they say, is history. After enjoying a wildly successful career in the entertainment industry, Delta was a lead coach on popular television show The Voice, where she mentored budding singers who aspired to be exactly like her.\n\nAnd while we love Delta for her undisputed talent, there is a side to her we’d love to know more about – her dating history.\n\nKeep scrolling as we delve into the Aussie beauty’s past romances, from casual flings to full-blown, PDA-packed serious romances.\n\n1. Mark Philippoussis\n\nIn 2004, Delta and tennis legend Mark Philippoussis began dating.\n\nIt seems things got serious between the pair fast, with Delta regularly attending Mark’s tennis matches and causing a media storm with photographers whenever the pair were spotted out and about.\n\nAround the same time they were dating, Delta was sadly diagnosed with a form of cancer called Hodgkin’s lymphoma. Mark is understood to have been a great support to her throughout the difficult time, inspiring one of Delta’s hit singles, Out of the Blue.\n\nControversially, the pair’s relationship ended following a slew of cheating rumours related to Mark, with the tennis star linked to Paris Hilton in 2004.\n\n“Delta and I had something special and unfortunately it didn’t work out and now it’s just making everything feel like it’s all rubbish, and it’s tough,” Philippoussis told 2GB radio’s Alan Jones at the time.\n\n“We realised things were tough,” he said.\n\n“We’re both young, she’s just starting her career. She’s going to get bigger and bigger and I need to get my career back on track and it’s a decision we both came up with.”\n\nBut it seems that Delta knew she was better off without him, revealing on The Voice in 2015 that ex-boyfriends “make number one hits for you.”\n\nYou tell ’em Delta!\n\n2. Blair McDonough\n\nWhile Delta starred on Neighbours, rumours swirled she had a fling with her co-star Blair McDonough in 2003.\n\nAccording to the Sydney Morning Herald, Delta’s hit single Not Me, Not I is rumoured to be about his infidelity – yikes.\n\nNeither ave officially commented on the rumours, so we’re not sure how true this one is.\n\n3. Brian McFadden\n\nProbably one of Delta’s most high profile romances was with none other than boy band member Brian McFadden.\n\nIn 2004, the pair began what turned out to be a very long romance.\n\nBrian, who was part of the popular UK boy band Westlife, was even engaged to the Australian singer, but they broke up in 2011.\n\nSpeaking to Vogue about the romance shortly after it ended, Delta revealed: “There is so much I’d like to say. I was really unhappy and I didn’t know how to get out. I learnt. I got there in the end.”\n\nREAD NEXT: This “couple game” Delta Goodrem and Brian McFadden played when they dated is pretty gross\n\n4. Nick Jonas\n\nAfter her relationship with Brian ended, Delta struck up a relationship with another boy band star – Nick Jonas.\n\nAccording to reports at the time, Nick and Delta dated for 10 months before they called it quits in February 2012.\n\nAnd despite their eight year age-difference, it seems the pair had undeniable chemistry and remain firm friends even to this day.\n\n5. Darren McMullen\n\nThis one isn’t necessarily confirmed, but the rumour mill was definitely in overdrive when Darren and Delta began filming the first season of The Voice together.\n\nThe show’s host Darren actually told Sunday Life magazine in 2016 that he and Delta were never in a “confirmed relationship” but they “liked each other and hung out”.\n\nHe also confirmed the pair had remained close friends. Just as well, as things would surely have been awkward when Darren returned to host The Voice in 2020 if that wasn’t the case!\n\n6. Drew Mitchell\n\nThere’s nothing quite like the lure of a sportsman, and that certainly rang true for Delta when it was revealed she was dating ex-Wallabies star Drew Mitchell.\n\nThe pair were believed to be dating in 2016, but in December that same year, Woman’s Day revealed the pair had reportedly split after Delta dumped him over the phone.\n\nA source revealed to the publication that he was simply “not her speed”.\n\nWell, there you go!\n\n7. Guy Sebastian?!\n\nBefore we get too excited – let’s just preface this to say there is no confirmation as yet that proves Delta and Guy were in a relationship – however, there are certainly rumours.\n\nRecently speaking to WHO, Guy revealed that 16 years ago, the pair “kinda hung out … call it dates or whatever”, while he was on a break from dating his now-wife Jules Sebastian!\n\n“To be honest, it was so brief,” he said, before adding: “We were never girlfriend and boyfriend, we were literally just seeing each other.”\n\nDelta however, brushed off the comments, telling the Kyle and Jackie O show: “Oh my God, was he talking about that?”\n\nShe then confirmed that one of the so-called dates consisted of the pair simply watching a Harry Potter film together.\n\n8. Seal\n\nIn 2017, it was reported Delta had struck up a relationship with fellow Voice coach at the time, Seal.\n\nAnd while the pair never confirmed things officially, a source revealed to Woman’s Day that Delta had been “spending a lot of time with Seal off set and she’s fallen hard for him.”\n\nWhether that was true or not remains to be seen, and with Delta now confirmed to be dating a brand new beau, things clearly ended before they could have begun (in public, in any case!)\n\nNot an ex! Meet Matthew Copley\n\nDelta is currently in a relationship with musician Matthew Copley – but the pair keep their relationship notoriously private.\n\nIn January 2019, the singer shared a sweet (and rare!) photo of herself and Matthew cosied up on a deck chair.\n\nThe singer also shared an intimate video to her Instagram story around the same time of the pair taking part in a singalong group.\n\nIn 2021 the couple appears to be going strong, although they remain very private. In April, Delta thrilled fans by sharing a rare snap of them hanging out on a yacht with TV presenter Renee Bargh and publicist Nicole Foster.\n\nIn the picture, musician Matthew had his arm draped around the Solid Gold songstress while Delta brandished a wide grin as she rested her arm on her boyfriend’s shoulder.\n\nCaptioning the image, Matthew simply wrote: “Matthew’s Angels”.\n\nIt seems Delta has finally found some harmony when it comes to love! Watch their sweet moment below."
