        "text": "Now Kerry Katona is clean and says she feels “amazing” – but Brian McFadden and Delta Goodrem are splitting up after seven years together.\n\n“Delta Goodrem and Brian McFadden regretfully announce that they are no longer engaged and after much consideration have mutually decided to end their relationship,” said a spokesman.\n\n“This decision has been made with a lot of soul-searching from both parties with the realisation they have grown apart.”\n\nBrian, 30, met Delta in 2004 when he and Kerry – who have two children together, Molly Marie, nine, and Lilly-Sue, eight – had recently separated. They got engaged in 2007 after Brian and Kerry divorced but no date was ever set and the relationship has seemed to cool over the past year.\n\nDelta, 26, has reportedly been spending most of her time in Los Angeles recording an album, while Brian has been largely based Down Under where he is a judge on Australia’s Got Talent.\n\nBut Brian paid tribute to his ex on Twitter, saying: “I love Delta and always will. She is one of God’s living angels. I thank her for giving me the best years of my life.”"
