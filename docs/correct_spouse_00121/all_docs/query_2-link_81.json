        "text": "Former Westlife star Brian McFadden has put his forthcoming wedding to Olympian Danielle Parkinson on hold amid the coronavirus pandemic.\n\nThe couple got engaged in December, and had hoped to wed later this year. However, due to the current lockdown the plans have been stalled.\n\n“We’ve put our plans on hold for the moment,” he told Heat magazine. “We’re just going to wait and see what happens over the next few months.”\n\nHe went on to tease plans for the big day, including a performance with pal and Boyzone star Keith Duffy – who he was due to be touring with right now.\n\n“When it does happen you can guarantee that,” he explains. “After a few drinks me and Keith will be up on that stage.\n\n“We spend most of our life on the road, so this is actually the longest I’ve been home in four years,” he added. “My eldest (daughter) had symptoms for a few days. She’s living with her mum but luckily no one else in the house got it.”"
