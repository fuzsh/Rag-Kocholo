        "text": "They say time heals all wounds but that doesn't appear to be the case when it comes to the love triange between Delta Goodrem, Brian McFadden and his ex-wife Kerry Katona.\n\nAppearing on UK talk show Loose Women, Kerry opened up about her marriage to the former Westlife band member, saying another \"loose woman\" ruined her marriage. Watch Kerry's rant in the video above!\n\n\"I was still Kerry McFadden... I was still married to Brian at the time,\" the former Atomic Kitten member told the show's panel, recalling her previous stints on the program.\n\n\"You didn't know this, but everytime I was on Loose Women it was always 'my Brian this' and 'my Brian that' and this one time Brian said to me 'I'm going to go and record this new single with this girl called Delta Goodrem. Will you come with me?' And I said, 'I can't, I'm doing Loose Women'. Can you imagine if I didn't come on this show?! I'd have still been married!\"\n\nWith the rest of the panel gasping at her candid admission, Kerry continued her rant and taking a swipe at Australia's sweetheart Delta.\n\n\"Loose Women ruined my marriage! Well, one of them.\"\n\nRELATED: Delta and Hugh look totally loved-up\n\nRELATED: Is Seal dating a major Hollywood star?\n\nYikes!\n\nKerry and Brian, who share two children together, wed in 2002, however their marriage was short-lived with Brian filing for divorce in 2004 after an alleged affair with Delts.\n\nHe and Delta went on get engaged during their seven-year relationship, but never made it down the aisle with the couple splitting back in 2011."
