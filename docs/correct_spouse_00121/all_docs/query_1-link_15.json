Very radio friendly and I think there's talk of it being the 2nd single from Brian's Wall Of Soundz album.\n\nThe album is out to download on Itunes worldwide from 23rd April. I would love this to enter the UK charts - i know thats not gonna happen. But it would just be amazing if it did\n\nIs it wrong that I have facebooked this everyone I know with the Itunes release date? Did i mention worldwide? So UK, Ireland, the rest of Europe and America can download this too!!!\n\nExcited!!!\n\nSorry, usually I have to import Delta's stuff so to be able to download something knowing its making a contribution here, makes me feel all giddy!\n\nHaha, I know what you mean.\n\nI'd love to get the album physically but I'm going to download it anyway to show my support. Poor Brian, people really don't like him. But this album is very, very good.\n\nI don't think people hate him actually. Maybe people on here, but if he was to release his new stuff here - here's hoping - I think it would do pretty well.\n\nBrian didn't release his 2nd album in the UK - but he did release Like Only A Woman Can in Ireland and that went straight to #1 - think it stayed there for a couple of weeks as well.\n\nI think the hate has died down now that everyone hates Kerry Katona instead... I tihnk that releasing a song all about how he loved the normal, family life then leaving his wife about a fortnight later made him seem a bit ridiculous, but that's a long time ago now.\n\nI don't think this is terribly special, Delta's done much better (I don't follow Bri(y)an)\n\nMaureen said:\n\nThere is another link to it if you search.\n\nYes, it is a good song. Really good. Do people hate Brian in particular or do they just not care about his records?\n\nAnyway, well done Bryiyiyian.\n\nI don't think he's half as hated in the UK as this board would lead you to believe.\n\nThis song is really good actually, and I can see it being huge on the radio over here. However, it sounds literally nothing like the first single he's releasing from Wall of Soundz. Not that I really care, just a bit odd. I have no idea what the concept is for that album anyway as I'm not a big fan. I presume it's a mixed bag of genres or something?\n\nUm no, there is no other video online at the moment. I found it here though:\n\nhttp://www.nhaccuatui.com/nghe?M=RLXGN4gKzx\n\nIt should start playing after a few seconds. Liking the song quite much, but I wish Delta would release new music instead of Brian! He comes across so... unwashed. (And Just say so is awful, btw.)"
