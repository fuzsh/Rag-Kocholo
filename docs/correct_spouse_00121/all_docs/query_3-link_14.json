        "text": "Delta Lea Goodrem was born on November 9, 1984. She is an Australian singer-songwriter, pianist, and actress. Goodrem signed to Sony at the age of 15 and rose to fame in 2002, starring in the Australian soap opera Neighbours as Nina Tucker. Goodrem has achieved eight number-one singles and three number-one albums in her home country. Her debut album Innocent Eyes was released in March 2003 and debuted at number-one on the ARIA album charts. Goodrem ceased work on Neighbours and her music to begin treatment and in early August. Delta Goodrem released albums that contained many themes. One of the themes is sickness and illness and how it can impact someone’s life. While coping with cancer, Goodrem wrote many songs before and after treatment for cancer leading to the release of her second album, Mistaken Identity.\n\nMistaken Identity is the second album by Australian singer, Delta Goodrem. It was released in Australia on November 8, 2004 by Daylight Records and on November 11, 2004 elsewhere. Goodrem co-wrote some of the album with Guy Chambers, who also produced the album with Richard Flack and Steve Power. Mistaken Identity debuted at number one on the Australian Albums Chart making it her second number one album but the sales did not match up to her previous album, Innocent Eyes, released in 2003 which sold 4.5 million copies worldwide.The two number-one singles from the album are “Out of the Blue” and “Almost Here.” The other singles from the album are “Mistaken Identity” and “A Little Too Late.” They became top twenty hits. The album features Goodrem’s first duet with Irish singer, Brian McFadden. Mistaken Identity focuses on Goodrem finding out she had cancer and her battle with cancer in a year. The album portrays how cancer changed her life and music was her resort. “I was drenched in perspiration and couldn’t move for fear. I thought I’d seen a dark figure trying to hand me a note. Now, it’s obvious my subconscious was warning me to get help,” says Goodrem prior to finding out she had cancer. Goodrem looks at the light of things in perspective. “I used to get stressed out, but my cancer has put everything into perspective.”\n\nWhen talking about Mistaken Identity, Goodrem says, “It’s a more grown up album and my music changed because my life had changed; the whole world around me had changed. My music had to reflect that.”\n\nThe album Mistaken Identity starts off with the track “Out of the Blue.” The track starts off like a gentle breeze and then the tempo builds up. You feel a plunge of energy when she says “Out of the blue”, like somebody freed the sync, her vocals start rushing like bubbly water. Goodrem is very secretive as to who the person generating energy and uncontrollable emotions is… The video for this song is unusual because everything is on fire.\n\nThe second track on the album is “The Analyst.” The song has a great piano kick start that draws attention. It is about analyzing, and going back in time. It is something in the human nature that is a pattern for most people, usually bringing out the skeptic in us. I like the line: “Can you be sure we haven’t met see the eyes they don’t forget, they wander through the passage-ways that tease a restless mind.” We all cannot resist putting everything in question, what is, and why is. This song is like a wakeup song in which Goodrem sings about herself in the third person.\n\n“Mistaken Identity” is the third track on the album that has a great tempo. This is about Delta not coming together with the changes her cancer brought. The message stands out the most in the stanza: “The sun likes to rise and the moon likes to fall / And that’s kind like my life / Now I’ve played the role of the nice girl next door / Who gets cut like a knife / Now I’m not looking for apology eyes / And I don’t want to spend a night on a bed of beautiful lies / Erase and rewind leave that sick girl behind / And fast forward / fast forward” Goodrem is saying she is aware of her condition, but she won’t let it define the way she carries on about herself. Don’t give me those looks and don’t make me feel that way, because that’s not me. Delta Goodrem will not let cancer define her.\n\nThe fourth track is “Sanctuary” which is a song also cancer related. The song is about finding stability in a world where reality is made to be a mess. There is someone out there who has all the strength we all need and who has a warm, caring heart that understands and gives comfort.\n\nThe fifth track is titled “A Little Too Late.” This is a refreshing song. It is soft and uplifting like songs on Goodrem’s previous album, Innocent Eyes.\n\nThe sixth track is “Be Strong.” This starts off breezy like “Out Of The Blue” but goes on to be more interesting. It sinks into you as she starts to get more intense with the verses. It speaks out to anyone who’s had a rough time and anyone who’s been broken and thought of giving up. Getting up after a struggle is not easy but it urges a change in the way we see things. We get up more prepared and face difficulties with strength we renewed from experiences. The song stretches a strong point.\n\nThe eighth track is a duet with Brian McFadden titled “Almost Here.” When Deltas vocals come in, it’s the high point of the song. She comes in like an angel and saves the song. The song leaves a great memory to look back on a relationship. The track focuses on the relationship Goodrem and McFadden had with one another.\n\nThe tenth track, “Electric Storm” is one of my personal favorites on this album. This comes to be as an explosion! Goodrem brings out so much power in her voice. The “Electric Storm” represents a turbulent relationship. Fantastic lyrics and the way Delta delivers her vocals over a great piano layer strikes like lightning. The song carries a strong meaningful message of heartache. Everything in this song fits and makes sense. Goodrem performed the song at her “Visualise Tour.” I love the way she performs the song. She has a voice that is soothing.\n\nThe next track is “Extraordinary Day.” The track gives you the haunting feeling of regret, deep sadness and a scent of death. Goodrem pours out her soul, July 8th was the day when Delta Goodrem found out about her cancer and started facing it. She tacked her emotions into words so well. Goodrem expresses how much pain in this song. “…And I feel this isolated”. The genuineness and honesty of it gets you. You can feel the emotions build up, and tears come as the song progresses. The live version of the song when she performed it on tour you hear the pain just from her vocals.\n\nThe twelfth track on the album is “Fragile.” The song is a perfect example of how the piano can deliver the most sensitive emotions like vulnerability. The vocal is charming yet lovable. Delta Goodrem really opens up her doors when she talks about feeling fragile, alone, and not feeling strong. She expresses herself feeling vulnerable which everyone to this day can relate to. Everyone has times where they are feeling vulnerable and at a low state in their life. The album contains two bonus tracks.\n\nThe first bonus track is titled “Disorientated.” Goodrem’s vocal wins you over immediately. Goodrem always manages to give diversity in every song. She puts a twist in this particular one. It can make someone feel the need to get up, jump and spin around the room with their arms wide open. It makes someone feel good about being disorientated. The message is that everyone wasn’t born with a map of what to do and be in life so it is okay to be disorientated. It is perfect to be young and a little wild because everything comes in its time.\n\nThe second bonus track is titled “You Are My Rock.” This song is Delta Goodrem’s thank you song to her brother. Her brother was there at her moments of weakness. You feel what it is like to be in her shoes and how much having an understanding, and helpful brother means. The rock symbolizes the stability he brought into her life. The track ends with a cruel, sharp ending: “We all need someone until we die.” “Mistaken Identity is mostly made up of glossy ballads, which may not be subtle but certainly pack an emotional punch. It’s all down to Goodrem’s strikingly raw vocals – when she gives thanks for still being alive, you can tell she really means it. A powerful album,” says Andrew Lynch. “I felt very unattractive and wrote my 2004 album, Mistaken Identity, about that whole time. And yet I felt wise, as though I knew something other people didn’t.” Overall, Mistaken Identity is the ultimate statement on the highs and lows of the two years of Delta Goodrem’s life prior and after to experiencing cancer.\n\nArlene Chiu"
