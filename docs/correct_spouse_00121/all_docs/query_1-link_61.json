It's messing all my plans up... I was going to produce another album but I won't get any work done with both events going on.\"\n\nDelta – who was recently spotted meeting Britain's Prince William during his tour of Sydney – is fortunately a \"huge sports fan\" so has been understanding to Brian's wishes.\n\nThe Australian actress-turned-singer – who was first rumoured to marry Brian in December 2009 – said: \"I would love to go to the World Cup.\"\n\n- BANG! SHOWBIZ"
