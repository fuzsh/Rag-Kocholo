        "text": "A big fat nope to this one.\n\nSo apparently the simplicity of Netflix and chill wasn’t Delta Goodrem and Brian McFadden’s cup of tea when it came to spending quality time with each other and showing affection. Instead, if they had some time to kill and wanted to show their love for one another, it’s been claimed they’d spit in each other’s mouths.\n\nEach to their own, but still, an M&S dine in for two and a box set surely would have been more romantic.\n\nKyle Sandilands, host of KIIS FM, revealed the pairs alleged time-wasting game would take place at his house.\n\nSpeaking on the show after playing a song by the pair, Kyle said: ‘I remember when I’d have them around my house and they were in love and sometimes would spit in each other’s mouth.’\n\nCo-host Jackie had the same reaction as all of us – ‘why?’. Kyle replied: ‘Fun, they said fun. I always thought, “Wow! That’s weird”.\n\n‘Delta would sit with her mouth open and Brian would spit into her mouth and Delta would spit back into his mouth.’\n\nOh the visuals.\n\nDelta and Brian, who’s just been announced as a Dancing On Ice contestant, got engaged in 2007, and went on to split in 2011.\n\nThey met in 2004 after working together on the track Almost Here.\n\nA year after their split he was in a relationship with model Vogue Williams, whom he went on to marry, but they split in 2017.\n\nVogue got with Made In Chelsea’s Spencer Matthews shortly after, and the pair recently got married and had a baby.\n\nTheir son was born in early September, with Spencer announcing they are ‘truly blessed’ by his arrival.\n\nMORE : Stormzy and Fatboy Slim first headline acts announced for Snowbombing festival to celebrate 20th anniversary"
