        "text": "I actually think they are two of the most entertaining popstars of recent years - just because they're not having meltdowns and acting like divas does not mean they do not have personalities. Watch Delta's Believe Again tour to see. I agree when you watch back some of Delta's old interviews (especially Mistaken Identity era) Delta seems uncomfortable, but she is far from that now - she's come into her own - that's why I want her back in the UK to show everyone here how much she has grown as a person.\n\nAs for Mistakes - well they performed it a few days ago together at one of Brian's gigs - and Delta sang the 2nd verse on her own - so I assume she will get that verse for the single version\n\nHigh delusion factor in this thread. Delta's career is dead and Brian is a revolting person who resorts to nasty tweets about his ex-wife and relying on autotune for some very ordinary chart success in Australia, becuase there's no way he'd have a hit back in UK. You don't get much lower than public tweeting vendettas, particularly when there are kids involved. And all Delta does these days is whore it out for soy milk and some crappy anti-acne cream. Pathetic people.\n\nJohnny_d said:\n\nHigh delusion factor in this thread.

Pathetic people.\n\nOkay, just calm down.\n\nDelta's career isn't dead by any means - she's been working with some fantastic people on her next album which will see a global release, so we will discuss the longevity of her career after that. She hasn't released an album since 2007 in Australia and it's unfortunate that she chose to be face of product campaigns that all launched at the same time, but as soon as she releases music again then the attention will revert to that.\n\nAs for Brian, I am not a fan of his public persona but he is a good songwriter and has a few really great songs - and quite a few on his latest album. His feud with Kerry Katona may not be the highlight of his character but lets just live and let live a little bit while we remember that this is a bloody good song!"
