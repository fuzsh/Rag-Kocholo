Elizabeth Hurley, who married longtime boyfriend Arun Nayar in 2007, tried to do damage control on a tabloid report claiming she'd spent the night with cricketer Shane Warne by tweeting on Sunday that she and husband had separated a few months ago. (A version of this tactic was also recently employed by David Arquette during his split from Courteney Cox.)

"Not a great day," she tweeted Sunday, after the publication of photos in the News of the World showing the Hurley and Warne kissing. But she also insisted that "our close family & friends" were aware of Hurley's separation from Nayar, the heir to an Indian textile empire.
