        "text": "Highest Rated: 73% Austin Powers: International Man of Mystery (1997)\n\nLowest Rated: 0% Viktor (2014)\n\nBirthday: Jun 10, 1965\n\nBirthplace: Basingstoke, Hampshire, England, UK\n\nBeing declared one of the sexiest women in film history by Empire magazine would be a title which many actresses would find difficult to live up to, but Elizabeth Hurley was unlike most of the models-turned-movie stars that preceded her. Not only blessed with high cheek bones and a curvy physique, she was also blessed with a sharp business sense, innate intelligence, as well as an almost supernatural ability to remain poised in the face of ugly controversies. These scandals would come fast in furious, including the infamous arrest of her then-boyfriend, actor Hugh Grant, for soliciting a prostitute, followed a few years later with an ugly paternity suit against millionaire Stephen Bing over the birth of their child in 2001. Despite these high profile setbacks, Hurley remained a popular model with her years-long contract with Estee Lauder, as well as maintained a modest career as an actress and producer, most notably starring as Vanessa Kensington, the knockout agent paired with Mike Meyers in \"Austin Powers: International Man of Mystery\" (1997).\n\nHighest rated movies\n\n73% Austin Powers: International Man of Mystery\n\n63% EDtv\n\n59% Permanent Midnight\n\n53% Austin Powers: The Spy Who Shagged Me\n\n50% Bedazzled\n\n47% Then Came You\n\n34% The Weight of Water\n\n30% Double Whammy\n\nPhotos\n\nElizabeth Hurley at arrivals for Breast Cancer Research Foundation BCRF Hot Pink Party, Park Avenue Armory, New York, NY May 15, 2019.
