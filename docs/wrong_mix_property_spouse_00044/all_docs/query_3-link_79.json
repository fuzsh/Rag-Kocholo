        "text": "Elizabeth Burks helps clients navigate government relations and legislation issues impacting their business. Having served for six years as chief of staff for US Senator Blanche Lincoln (D-AR), Elizabeth played a pivotal role in managing the Senator's legislative and political agendas. As a key moderate in the Senate, chairwoman of the Senate Agriculture Committee, and senior member of the Senate Finance and Energy Committees, Senator Lincoln and her top staff were involved in many of the most important policy debates over the last several Congresses.\n\nPrior to her work in the US Senate, Elizabeth served as legislative assistant to Senator Lincoln during her time as a US Representative, managing her health care-related work for the Health and Environment Subcommittee of the House Commerce Committee.\n\nIn addition, Elizabeth held the positions of both chief of staff and legislative director for Representative Jim Turner (D-TX), the top Democrat on the House Homeland Security Committee as well as a member of the House National Security Committee and the Government Reform and Oversight Committee. During her time with Representative Turner, Elizabeth also acted as the principal staff point of contact for the Blue Dog Coalition of moderate-to-conservative Democrats, of which Representative Turner served in its leadership as administrative co-chair."
