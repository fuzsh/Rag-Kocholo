        "text": "Escaping to Herefordshire, learning lines and baking with her son – the actress and model describes how she spends her weekends.\n\nTown and country\n\nI loathe being in London at weekends and always try to go home to Herefordshire. I love everything about the country – the fresh air, the peace, my dogs and my garden After enduring the M4, I usually have a stiff drink, light a fire and collapse on the sofa. Before bed, I’ll have a long bath with lots of scented bath oil and a good book.\n\nTerrifying to-do lists\n\nTruthfully, most weekends I’m juggling an overflowing inbox and a terrifying to-do list with trying to be Super Mum and Hostess with the Mostest. I try to squeeze in a dog walk or two, and my son and I always bake a cake together. I almost never go out at weekends, unless I’m invited to someone else’s house, but we rarely do that either. I see enough of other people during the week.\n\nShop local\n\nI nip into my local village and try to buy the majority of my food in the small, local shops. I’m lucky that we have a great butcher, greengrocer and bakery. We also have a very good bookshop, a wine shop and an excellent delicatessen. I often go to Countrywide as well and buy lots of things I don’t need.\n\nStress-busting\n\nIf I’m feeling stressed, I like silence. I turn off my phone and soak in the tub with my eyes shut, having made everyone promise to leave me alone for a while.\n\nRead between the lines\n\nWhen I’m filming, the entire weekend is about learning my lines. My son runs through them with me and I’m unbearable and totally unrelaxed until I know them. then I do the usual mad dash around the house, trying to put everything into the car for the trek back to London. If I have Monday off, I stay an extra night, which is bliss, and if I have Friday off, I leave London on Thursday night and do a victory dance.\n\nThe most important meal of the day…\n\nI don’t really each brunch as I love both breakfast and lunch too much. I usually have a cooked breakfast at weekends and a big lunch, too – always a roast on Sunday and big plates of salad on Saturday. I’m enamoured with my new fish poacher, so often do a whole salmon and make kedgeree with the leftovers.\n\nElizabeth’s luxury swim label, Elizabeth Hurley Beach, can be found at elizabethhurley.com"
