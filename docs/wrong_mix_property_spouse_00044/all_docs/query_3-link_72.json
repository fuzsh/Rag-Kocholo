        "text": "What makes him even more endearing is how he’s unapologetically himself, managing to be very open and “real” on his Instagram.\n\nHere are five things to know about Damian Hurley …\n\nHe’s been through issues related to his father\n\nDamian was born into a wealthy family. Other than his famous mother, his father, Steve Bing, was a wealthy businessman and producer, and his grandfather was billionaire Peter Bing, a property developer and one of the wealthiest people in the US.\n\nSteve had initially denied being the father of Elizabeth’s baby until a DNA test confirmed otherwise, per a BBC report. Later, Elizabeth refused her ex-partner’s offer of financial support for Damian, said to be worth about US$2.2 million, Vogue UK reported in 2002. “Damian and I are managing very well by ourselves,” she said.\n\nFast forward to many years later, in June 2020, Steve was found dead due to suicide, having jumped from his flat building, per People. He was 55. Damian later posted about his grief on Instagram, and expressed this thanks to those who extended their condolences.\n\nThe mother and son duo were later in the news again, this time concerning Damian being cut off from Steve’s inheritance, per Hello!\n\nHe’s born to be a model\n\nFamily issues aside, Damian has made plenty of headlines for happier reasons too. The rising star may have gotten into modelling in quite the unusual fashion – but his good looks are in his genes and it certainly seems meant to be.\n\nDamian was only 17 when he got a call telling him that renowned fashion photographer Steven Meisel wanted him to star in a campaign he was shooting in New York. Despite having not modelled before, he took the chance. “In a moment of madness I agreed, flew out, did the shoot and made it back to school in time for my first class on Monday,” he told Vogue India.\n\nHe’s a fragrance guy\n\nAsked about his daily essentials on Vogue India, Hurley said that he always brings a mini cologne sample with him together with his phone, wallet and chapstick. “Scent is very important – it can instantly wake you up and make you feel sexy,” he told the magazine.\n\nHis godfathers are famous icons\n\nHe shares a super close relationship with his mother\n\nOther than his striking resemblance to his superstar mum, Damian is also his mother’s biggest cheerleader. The mum-and-son duo have often made headlines for their Instagram posts – from Elizabeth posing in sultry bikinis (photographed by her son, of course) to Damian revealing a hot shirtless ensemble.\n\nA staunch advocate of breast cancer awareness, Elizabeth once revealed via Hello! how much her son has supported her in this journey. “It’s been part of Damian’s life ever since he could walk and talk, to be honest,” she said.\n\nDamian has called his mother his best friend, twin and favourite human on Instagram."
