        "text": "Elizabeth Hurley reunited with both her ex-boyfriend and ex-husband at a premiere for her son Damian's 'Strictly Confidential'\n\nElizabeth Hurley is all smiles reuniting with her exes.\n\nAt the Wednesday, May, 8 London premiere of her new movie Strictly Confidential, written and directed by son Damian Hurley, the British actress chatted and posed with ex-boyfriend Hugh Grant and ex-husband Arun Nayar.\n\nIn a long-sleeved dress of green sequins, the Bedazzled star, 58, took photos alongside Nayar, whom she was married to from 2007 to 2011. Elizabeth met the businessman, 59, soon after giving birth to her only child Damian, 22 (whom she shares with late film producer Steve Bing).\n\nRelated: Hugh Grant's 5 Children: Everything to Know\n\nOne of Damian’s godfathers, Grant, 63, was also on hand to support the release of Strictly Confidential. The Four Weddings and a Funeral star, married to Anna Eberstein since 2018, famously dated Elizabeth from 1987 to 2000; the two have remained friends ever since.\n\n\"I speak to him quite a lot,\" Elizabeth told PEOPLE in 2020. \"I still go to him for advice on scripts, even though he’s very happily married with five children and I’m very happy in my own life, there’s still certain bits we crossover with very well… asking advice about work, he’s still my go-to person.\"\n\nNever miss a story — sign up for PEOPLE's free daily newsletter to stay up-to-date on the best of what PEOPLE has to offer, from juicy celebrity news to compelling human interest stories.\n\nRelated: Elizabeth Hurley Wants to Do Another 'Austin Powers' Movie — Just in 'Slightly Different Costumes'\n\nThe Austin Powers actress leads Strictly Confidential as Lily, a wealthy woman whose daughter drowned near the family home in the Caribbean. Damian’s \"sensual thriller with a devilish twist,” per its synopsis, follows Georgia Lock’s character Mia returning to the scene, where “old passions rise, new secrets are uncovered, and Mia is pulled into a seductive world of sex, betrayal and murder.\"\n\n“My mother promised me she’d be in my first feature,” Damian told PEOPLE of his feature-length directorial debut. “True to her word, the minute Strictly Confidential was green-lit, my mother dropped everything and raced out to the Caribbean to help.”\n\nAs for the movie’s headline-making sex scene featuring Elizabeth and a younger costar, the actress told PEOPLE that while moments in the movie are “quite out there and daring, there actually isn’t any nudity. Nobody’s exploited at all. We all felt comfortable doing it.”\n\nRelated: Elizabeth Hurley Shares the 'Annoying' Mommy 'Rule' Son Damian Must Follow in Her House — Even at 22 (Exclusive)\n\nIt’s no surprise that Nayar appeared to help support the release of Strictly Confidential considering Damian has referred to him as a fatherly figure in the past. On New Year’s Eve, the filmmaker and model shared a shot to Instagram of Elizabeth and her ex-husband ringing in 2024 together.\n\nStrictly Confidential is in theaters and on digital now.\n\nFor more People news, make sure to sign up for our newsletter!"
