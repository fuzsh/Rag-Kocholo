        "text": "Mumbai residents had a message for newlyweds Elizabeth Hurley and Arun Nayar — get off our beach. City hall agreed, demolishing a wooden deck that had been built for a party to honor the couple.\n\nThe 41-year-old British actress-model and Nayar, 42, were married Friday in a private civil ceremony at Sudeley Castle in Winchcombe, 125 miles west of London.\n\nWorkers cleared away the makeshift platform that extended from a beach-front home onto the popular Juhu beach just before the party late Tuesday, said Civic Councilor Adolf D’souza.\n\n“Juhu beach belongs to the public and illegal constructions and extensions onto the beach are not permitted,” he said Wednesday.\n\nThe hosts, Indian industrialist Adi Godrej and his wife, Parmeshwar Godrej, could not be reached for comment, but residents said the private dinner party went on as scheduled.\n\nA smaller platform on the beach was permitted, said T. Sonpar, coordinator of the Juhu Citizens Welfare Group.\n\n“The rich and famous usually get away with this. But this time at least action was taken and the extension on the beach was reduced,” said Sonpar, who lodged complaints with police and civic officials. “Let your guests sit on the sand, we have no problem. But don’t restrict our access.”\n\nIndian media reported that more than 100 guests, including friends and relatives traveling with Hurley and Nayar from Britain, attended the party. Indian newspapers carried photographs of Hurley shielding her young son from photographers and cameramen gathered outside the Godrej home.\n\nThe couple left early Wednesday for wedding celebrations at Umaid Bhavan Palace, the Maharaja of Jodphur’s palace-turned-luxury resort in the state of Rajasthan in western India."
