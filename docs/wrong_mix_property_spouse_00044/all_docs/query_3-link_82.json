        "text": "Showbiz\n\nElizabeth Hurley's son Damian reveals storyline in debut film inspired by loss of his father\n\nThe filmmaker, 22, opens up in a new interview with Tatler\n\nElizabeth Hurley pictured with son Damian\n\nPA Wire\n\nLisa McLoughlin 26 April 2024\n\nElizabeth Hurley’s son Damian Hurley has said the storyline in his directorial debut was inspired by the tragic deaths of a close friend and his father, Steve Bing.\n\nIn the film, Strictly Confidential, a young woman drowns near her family's Caribbean home, and her relatives grapple with the aftermath of the tragedy.\n\nThe filmmaker, 22, revealed that the concept for the plot was drawn from his own experiences of loss, after a close friend and his biological father took their own lives.\n\nSpeaking on the inspiration behind the film’s storyline, Hurley told Tatler: “Finally, I unearthed a treatment I'd written when I was 17 in the aftermath of losing a close friend to suicide.\n\n“At the time I'd shelved it, deciding I wasn't yet ready to tell the story, but in the three-year interim I'd lost a parent, also to suicide, and had been forced to grow up fast.\n\n“I realised I now had the experience to bring the script to life, and Strictly Confidential was born: the story of a young woman who is haunted by the suicide of her best friend and determined to find answers.”\n\nHurley’s biological father Steve Bing died in 2020\n\nGetty Images\n\nBritish actress Elizabeth Hurley, 58, began dating late film producer Bing shortly after she split from Hugh Grant in 2000.\n\nThe Bedazzled star welcomed their son Damian in 2002 after their 18-month romance ended but the businessman contested paternity, claiming that they had been in a non-exclusive relationship at the time.\n\nBing tragically passed away in 2020 after taking his life in Los Angeles.\n\nRecently, the Austin Power star broke her silence after her son Damian said it “felt totally normal” to direct her raunchy sex scene in their new film.\n\nRead More\n\nWilko is back!

Nobody’s exploited at all. We all felt comfortable doing it.”\n\nStrictly Confidential was released in US cinemas and on Prime Video on April 5 and will be released in the UK on May 13.\n\nIf you're struggling and need to talk, the Samaritans operate a free helpline open 24/7 on 116 123.
