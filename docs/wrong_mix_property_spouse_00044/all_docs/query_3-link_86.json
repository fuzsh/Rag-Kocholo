        "text": "Established in 2005, Elizabeth Hurley Beach is a London based, luxury swim label. Focusing on sensual fit and jet set influences, it’s for the fashion-conscious woman seeking an element of luxury and excitement in her vacation wardrobe. The collection has had global success and now sells worldwide in both independent boutiques and renowned department stores. Each design is crafted using the highest quality cottons, silks and lycra to create well designed, high quality pieces for a beautiful summer wardrobe.\n\nElizabeth Hurley Beach also has a charming bijoux collection for young girls aged up to 13 years. The swimwear is made from premium European lycra which is soft, comfortable and quick drying. The embroidered kaftans, cover ups and signature terry cloth hoodies add a splash of originality to any girl’s vacation.\n\n“We’ve sold a lot of bikinis since we started. We’ve expanded the line a great deal since then and the collection is much broader. Our line for young girls is adorable. I hope we can keep going from strength to strength,” Elizabeth Hurley.\n\nActress and model Elizabeth Hurley has an obsession with beachwear, which she credits in part to growing up in rainy England where she never leaves the house without an umbrella. Elizabeth is involved in every aspect of the business from design through to manufacture and marketing.\n\n“I decided to venture into beachwear not only because I've always been obsessed with vacation clothes, but also because it's an area where women, regardless of shape or size, can either look amazing or really get it wrong. I wanted to develop resort collections which make women feel fabulous at any age,” Elizabeth Hurley."
