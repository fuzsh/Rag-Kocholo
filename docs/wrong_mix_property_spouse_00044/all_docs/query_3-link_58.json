        "text": "After a recent divorce and NBC’s pass on the Wonder Woman pilot (in which she was to play a villain), Elizabeth Hurley’s luck seems to be improving.\n\nSTORY: ‘Gossip Girl‘ Casts French Actress Roxane Mesquida as Blair’s Future In-Law\n\nA CW spokesperson confirms to The Hollywood Reporter that Hurley is joining next season for a recurring role, as first reported by TVLine.\n\nShe’ll play Diana Payne who exec producers Stephanie Savage and Joshua Safran describe as “a sexy, smart, self-made media mogul and all-around force to be reckoned with.” The character will apparently affect all the show’s characters, even “Gossip Girl” herself.\n\nHurley is best known for playing the sexy sidekick to Mike Myers’ titular character in the Austin Powers film franchise. Her next film, High Midnight, costarring Vincent D’Onofrio and Rachel Leigh Cook will be out next year.\n\nThe British actress formerly dated actor Hugh Grant for 13 years. She married Indian software exec and textile heir, Arun Nayar, in 2007, but announced their separation about three years later. Earlier this year, their divorce became final.\n\nEmail: Jethro.Nededog@thr.com; Twitter: @TheRealJethro\n\nRELATED:\n\n‘Gossip Girl’ Star Penn Badgley to Play Jeff Buckley on Big Screen\n\nComic-Con 2011: ‘The Vampire Diaries,’ ‘Alcatraz,’ ‘Fringe’ Panels Set"
