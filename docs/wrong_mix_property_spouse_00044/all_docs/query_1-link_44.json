I'm hoping that now Arun will get back home.\n\n\"I have messaged Arun and am waiting to hear from him. I am shocked.\"\n\nThe couple’s break-up was announced by Elizabeth last week after it was revealed she had been romancing Australian cricket legend Shane Warne.\n\nElizabeth and Vinod's relationship is believed to have been strained since her traditional Hindu wedding to Arun in Jodhpur, India, in March 2007 when Vinod was forced to cancel a £30,000 (€35,384) party he had planned to hold for the pair.\n\nThe nuptials cost £3m (€3.54m) but were the couple were criticised at the time for breaking rules on the consumption of alcohol in the region.\n\nVinod said at the time: \"Joanne and I were publicly humiliated for the sake of a HELLO! magazine deal. Liz and Arun treated us very shabbily and we were pushed into the background like poor relations.\n\n“I knew she was very ambitious, but I never realised just how important fame and attention is to her. This has broken my heart.”\n\nMeanwhile, the 45-year-old model-and-actress has been being comforted by ex-boyfriend Hugh Grant – who she was in a relationship 13 years – at the West London home they still own together in the wake of the fallout surrounding the split and her fledgling relationship with Shane.\n\nA source told the Daily Star newspaper: \"Hugh and Liz may have broken up years ago but they are still very close and he is always there for her.\""
