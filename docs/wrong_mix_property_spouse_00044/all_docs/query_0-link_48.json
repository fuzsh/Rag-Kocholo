Our close family & friends were aware of this.’\n\nNow it seems Miss Hurley has begun the move towards making the split official, and has filed for divorce from her husband.\n\nAccording to the Daily Mail, the star cited 'unreasonable behaviour’ as grounds for the divorce, in the papers filed yesterday, at London’s High Court.\n\nElizabeth is currently in Los Angeles filming TV show Wonder Woman, and has been spotted out and about with cricket star Shane during her trip.\n\nEarlier this year the actress flew to Australia to visit her beau, but cut short her trip and jetted back to the UK.\n\nTaking to Twitter, she wrote: 'Happy Valentine's Day! Remember, love is like a rollercoaster ride- sometimes it's exhilarating but sometimes u (sic) feel sick and want to get off.'\n\nSCANDALOUS CELEBRITY SPLITS"
