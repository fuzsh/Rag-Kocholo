        "text": "“I had an accident, but I am recovering well now,” he told me at a party at Maggie’s Cancer Caring Centre in west London.\n\nA friend says: “He was treated by some excellent burns specialists and has made a remarkable recovery using Crème de la Mer liberally as a healing agent.”\n\nMarriage can wait\n\nMandrake disclosed last month that Ken Livingstone was finally to marry his girlfriend, Emma Beal, after many years and two children together. The wedding is due to take place next to the reptile house at London Zoo this afternoon, but it remains to be seen whether the former mayor of London makes it to the ceremony, as I hear that he will be going in to work as usual. “Ken is devoted to his job and wasn’t going to let his wedding get in the way,” says my man at LBC, the London radio station for which he presents a three-hour show starting at 10am."
