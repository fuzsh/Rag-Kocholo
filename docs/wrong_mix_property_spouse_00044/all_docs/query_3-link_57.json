        "text": "Elizabeth Hurley has said she found it “liberating” to be directed by her son in a new film.\n\nThe actress and 21-year-old Damian Hurley, her son with American businessman Steve Bing, were asked by Access Hollywood about him taking photos of her in a bikini for her beachwear line.\n\nModel Damian said: “People find this really controversial… Showbusiness has been a fundamental part of my entire life.\n\n“So, to us, it’s not a thing, it’s just part of business. She takes my photos, I take hers.”\n\nHe made his debut as a film director with the forthcoming Strictly Confidential, which sees Elizabeth’s character in romantic scenes with actress Pear Chiravara.\n\nElizabeth, best known for starring in Austin Powers: International Man Of Mystery and Bedazzled, said Damian takes images for her fashion brand Elizabeth Hurley Beach and that he “looks out for me”.\n\nThe 58-year-old added: “Who likes being photographed in bikinis? No-one, even when you’re 22 and fabulous.. but it’s relaxing knowing someone’s behind the camera who looks out for me, which was the same on this movie in a way.\n\n“The things that his script needed me to do weren’t necessarily things I’d always done in movies many times before.\n\n“But having him there meant that I felt safe and looked-after, and I knew, in the production and in the post, he’d look after me.\n\n“So actually it’s kind of liberating to work with your family, I may do it again.”\n\nDamian said he was approached to make Strictly Confidential after an executive at Lionsgate saw his short film, The Boy On The Beach, which also starred his mother.\n\nHe said he has been making films since he was a child and was “terrified” before making his first feature, about a woman who is obsessed with her best friend’s death.\n\nHowever, he said he felt in his “comfort zone” because they “didn’t have time” during the short shoot to think about many things.\n\n“Thank God I had you (my mother) to do it with. I don’t think I would have survived that one,” he added.\n\nStrictly Confidential, which Damian wrote as well as directing, also stars The Evermoor Chronicles actress Georgia Lock, Freddie Thorp from Fate: The Winx Saga, and Hollyoaks’ Lauren McQueen.\n\nThe film will be released on April 4."
