        "text": "Hurley and Harry?\n\nElizabeth Hurley is slamming rumors that she took Prince Harry’s virginity. The theory surfaced after the Duke of Sussex, 39, recalled the first time he had sex in his book “Spare,” which was released in January 2023.\n\n“That was ludicrous!” Hurley, 58, said in response during a “Watch What Happens Live with Andy Cohen” appearance on Wednesday. “He said, ‘She was English. She was older than me. It was in Gloucestershire.’ And they were like, ‘Ah, it’s Elizabeth.’ It was absurd. It was ridiculous.”\n\nShe added, “It was like saying, ‘He’s great-looking. He’s American.’ Oh, it’s Andy Cohen.”\n\nIn fact, Hurley and Harry haven’t even crossed paths before.\n\nShe quipped: “I’ve never met him in my life.”\n\nHurley was on the Bravo show to promote her latest film, “Strictly Confidential,” which her son, Damian, wrote and directed.\n\nHarry — who stepped down from his royal duties in 2020 alongside wife Meghan Markle — never spoke out about the Hurley claims. In his memoir, however, he did call losing his virginity an “inglorious episode” in his life.\n\n“She liked horses, quite a lot, and treated me not unlike a young stallion,” he wrote of the “older woman.”\n\n“Quick ride, after which she’d smacked my rump and sent me off to graze,” Harry recounted in the book. “Among the many things about it that were wrong: It happened in a grassy field behind a busy pub. Obviously, someone had seen us.”\n\nShortly after the highly-publicized novel was released, Sasha Walpole claimed in an interview with The Sun that she was in fact the woman who took Harry’s virginity.\n\nAccording to the outlet, Walpole told her mom Lyn, 65, about her dalliance with the Duke of Sussex but was forced to come clean to her father Tony, 71.\n\n“I don’t understand why he went into such detail. He could have said that he lost his virginity and left it at that,” Walpole told the outlet.\n\n“He has done this to my privacy because I was going to keep my head down and not talk about it,” the now mother of two added. “If it wasn’t in the book none of this would be happening.”\n\nHarry and the “Suits” alum, 42, meanwhile, currently reside in Montecito, Calif., with their two children — son Archie, 4, and daughter Lilibet, 2.\n\nHurley, for her part, was previously married to Indian businessman Arun Nayar from 2007 to 2011, and shares Damian with late businessman Steve Bing. She also famously had a longtime relationship with good friend Hugh Grant.\n\nAlthough Hurley has never met Harry, she has met his dad, King Charles III, and estranged brother, Prince William, multiple times over the years."
