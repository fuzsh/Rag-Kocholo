        "text": "Madeleine (Camille Keaton) is a woman torn between a waking life and a prophetic dream one. She has nightmares about being chased through woods by strange witchy characters, she dreams of an baby doll in a glass coffin immolated on a burning wreck of a race car. She also envisions a terrible accident, a race interrupted by one of the cars spinning out of control and slamming into a wall, catching fire. This last seems to relate to Luis (Ricardo Salvino), the son of her occult-obsessed husband Franz Shuman (Sylvano Tranquili), or does it?\n\nMadeleine’s waking hours are haunted by her inability to carry a child. She lost one before, though the specifics are left unspoken. She is married, but her husband does not seem erotically interested in her, which is fine because she’s perfectly capable of finding handsome men to seduce. First there’s Thomas (Pier Maria Rossi), who ultimately chooses to leave her for a relationship with Mary (Paola Senatore), but others are quick to fall into Madeleine’s gravitational pull.\n\nIs Madeleine a nymphomaniac, is she psychologically damaged in another way, or is she caught in the realm of some great supernatural mystery? Writer/director Roberto Mauri helms a sly, earthy examination of a character in crisis with Madeleine: Anatomy of a Nightmare (1974).\n\nBefore she became a sensation in the gritty, grotty horror film I Spit On Your Grave (1978), Camille Keaton appeared in quite a few Italian films. Inspired by Clint Eastwood’s success, she left the states on a trip to the Continent, hoping to jumpstart her acting career there. She made quite a string of interesting features, starring as the titular character in the classic giallo What Have You Done to Solange? (1972) as well as a half dozen other films. Three of these have been collected into the recent Vinegar Syndrome limited edition Blu-ray boxed set, Camille Keaton in Italy, and the first of the pictures in that box is Keaton’s last Italian flick from the 1970s, Madeleine: Anatomy of a Nightmare.\n\nThat subtitle is nicely chosen since it encapsulates quite a few thematic elements from the flick. This is a nightmarish piece, in which a husband who is practicing occult activities can seemingly appear and disappear at will or hypnotize anyone who gazes into his eyes for long enough. It is a world that constantly shifts between bawdy, strange, erotically charged, and unsettling tones. It’s a film where people are not certain of themselves and we are never sure of their motivations.\n\nAlso, the anatomy part is accurate, since it is a film that is nigh-obsessed with bodies and body parts. Camille Keaton’s Madeleine only ever appears in cutoff jeans or skirts that show off her legs. There’s nudity aplenty, some tasteful and some sketchy, as well as plenty of sexually charged scenes about the ways people touch one another. Into this world, Franz is all the more sinister since he seldom shares physical contact of a positive nature with anyone and instead uses his uncanny hypnotic eyes to manipulate. The flesh and the way it can connect between people almost to obsessive levels is one of the topics both the film Madeleine and its titular character grapple with.\n\nKeaton herself delivers a strong performance here as a woman in trouble. She’s got the leading lady looks of course, and the camera certainly enjoys observing and capturing them. However, she also has a sense of how to move her body, how to show emotion through casual gestures and expressions, and how to invest her dialogue with the requisite passion. This is a character that balances being in the moment with a kind of aloofness, a tricky line to play. As well, Madeleine has agency and yet is pulled by forces she cannot completely understand or control, which is also difficult to convey. However, Keaton does a fine job. We may not know the answers to this woman’s mysteries until the revelations in the final minutes, but we never fail to be intrigued.\n\nDirector Roberto Mauri was approaching the end of his career when he wrote and directed Madeleine, and there is an appreciable level of control to the direction. This is an Italian genre film from the 1970s, so one expects some odd turns and some unusual choices in terms of the way the storytelling progresses ala Lenzi, Fulci, Argento, or Bava. There are some intriguing moments but we never go completely into the realms of lunacy. We never once feel like we’re in the hands of a madman for a director. Instead, for its symbolic and strange opening dream sequence through its odder turns, the film nevertheless appeals to cold rational logic in the spirit of classic giallos such as Bava’s Evil Eye (1963).\n\nCinematographer Carlo Carlini has a talent for photography that seethes with emotion, eeriness, and sensuality. There are several subtle but ambitious shots throughout the film. One of the more memorable sequences involves a long shot at an evening party, which first tracks along, following Alfonso Sarlo’s butler character as he proceeds around the massive swimming pool dropping off drinks at several tables, passing through their conversations like a shadow, before the waiter moves off and the camera settles on Madeleine chatting with another woman. Without a break, the camera pans when she walks off to the side and then watches her walk along another stretch of the pool before finally zooming slowly in on her final destination. Only then do we cut. It might not be as long as the shots composing Rope (1948) nor as complex as the lengthy takes in Touch of Evil (1958) or Goodfellas (1990), but it has a surprising number of moving parts over the course of the sequence. The end result does not call a lot of attention to itself, but it’s a perfectly executed moment that easily draws us from conversation to conversation and then from character to character.\n\nSome viewers will be repulsed by a couple of the characters. For all his veneer as a loving husband, the Franz character veers off into some pretty despicable places—including sexually assaulting a drugged woman. Likewise, there are some assumptions about masculine bravado and machismo that are relics of a bygone era, which might not sit well with the contemporary viewer. However, weathering these rougher patches will allow viewers the opportunity to recontextualize them once the finale is reached.\n\nYou see, there’s a twist late in the final act, which reveals everything that we’ve seen was actually told to us by a less than reliable narrator. That twist will be divisive among viewers because it can arguably seem to undermine all the character developments that came before. It certainly seems to explain away the hinted elements of the supernatural or paranormal, which have charged some of the scenes prior. On the other hand, it both addresses the stranger elements in a logical manner that does not smack of a weird menace/Scooby-Doo story, and it sets up a final twisted revelation in the last seconds before the credits. I frowned when these final moments first appeared, but I had a better appreciation for them when I got to the final shot.\n\nThe Vinegar Syndrome Blu-ray release for this film is a lovely thing, all told. The newly scanned and restored 4K presentation is gorgeous—though the 35mm original camera negative was apparently damaged in a couple of places, resulting in occasional greenish hues or image oddities. Nothing major and nothing long lived, but the obsessive will likely be distracted. The disc also includes an interview with Keaton, in which she revisits her Italian career with a few fun behind the camera stories about Madeleine in particular—also, it’s one of her favorite performances. As well, there’s a commentary track with Keaton and Art Ettinger as well as an audio essay from Rachael Nisbet.\n\nMadeleine: Anatomy of a Nightmare is a groovy psychological shocker. Not quite horror, it’s more of a dark fantasy that tackles some intriguing topics, introduces some odd characters and then reveals their sleazier sides, and yet manages to tell an intriguing story about a woman who dreads as much as she loves, who is at the mercy of forces she cannot control and does not understand, and who flirts with self-destruction the same way she does handsome men. Madeleine is an delightful oddity of a movie, an Italian blend of the sleazy, the sexy, and the eerie.\n\n#\n\nMadeleine: Anatomy of a Nightmare is sadly unavailable in DVD and streaming editions. However, there’s a copy included in the delightful Camille Keaton in Italy Blu-ray boxed set from Vinegar Syndrome.\n\nNext, we continue to explore the Camille Keaton in Italy boxed set with the second film of the bunch, Tragic Ceremony (1972). It is available in a DVD edition as well as the Vinegar Syndrome limited edition Blu-ray boxed set.\n\nWriting for “What Strange Power You Have Over Me: Madeleine” is copyright © 2021 by Daniel R.
