        "text": "Madeline, Study of a Nightmare offers up the pretence of a psychosexual study of reality; realised through the psychedelic lens of 1970s Italy. We open with a dream sequence that sees pregnant Camille Keaton running through the woods while being chased by a bunch of middle aged women in brightly coloured wigs. It's captivating, beautifully shot and feels loaded with some kind of intelligent meaning. It sets the tone nicely for the rest of the film. It's all very lovely to look at. Keaton gets to enjoy herself - driving around in a sports car, taking multiple lovers, skinny dipping snd topless horse riding. The tone is mellow and relaxed. It often feels like there's nothing really happening, but the‚Ä¶\n\n‚ÄúFor the Camille Keaton fan, this is the movie.‚Äù\n\n[previous review here]\n\nThis would be my movie if I was Gloria Swanson in Sunset Boulevard\n\n‚Äî Camille Keaton on Madeline\n\nüó£Ô∏è Watched with audio commentary by actress Camille Keaton and Art Ettinger\n\nOpens with pregnant Camille Keaton vs. Power Ranger witches and features topless horseback riding, bikini badminton, Paola Senatore wearing the loudest party dress (until she isn't) and one of the most beautiful swimming pools in all Italian cinema. Tell me, why is this so underseen? Sorry, Art, but Cry of a Prostitute was not directed by Umberto Lenzi (also, the male equivalent of camel toe is called a moose knuckle).\n\nFilm critic Roberto Curti doesn‚Äôt consider Madeline to‚Ä¶\n\n‚ÄúYou fascinate me, but I‚Äôm afraid of you.‚Äù\n\nFor a psychedelic, psychosexual dreamscape, there sure are a lot of dancing hippies in this movie. Not a giallo, but in many ways looks and sounds like a film from the genre‚Äôs later, artier period. This was Camille Keaton‚Äôs personal favorite of all the films she made in Italy. Maybe because there‚Äôs a languid, almost feminine tone to it? Maybe because it‚Äôs more mood than mystery, more vibe than bloodshed? There‚Äôs nothing mean-spirited about Madeleine‚Äôs psychic journey‚Äîwe‚Äôre on her side from the opening shot‚Äîvisibly pregnant, being chased through the woods by candy-colored witches narrating her miscarriage nightmare.\n\nIn a sign of the times, there are rumblings about parapsychology, manifestations of the unconscious,‚Ä¶\n\nMadeline is a surreal psychological thriller that hasn't got much of a plot. It's about the atmosphere and style. It feels weird because there is no guiding thread in this film. But that doesn't matter because the look and feel of this movie are fantastic. From the outstanding soundtrack to the brilliant cinematography, it had everything I need in a movie.\n\nCamille Keaton delivered a dreamy performance that is strong enough to carry the film. But the supporting cast is pretty cool too, giving us performances by Paola Senatore (Immagini di un convento, Emanuelle in America), Silvano Tranquilli (So Sweet, So Dead, High Crime, and Riccardo Salvino (Your Vice Is a Locked Room and Only I Have the Key).\n\nIt's‚Ä¶\n\nThe 1974 Italian psychosexual horror film, Madeleine: Anatomy of a Nightmare, opens with a dream sequence of the title character, played by Camille Keaton, being chased through a field of tall reeds by spooky witches, each with a different bright florescent hair color. During one camera shot showing the witches from behind, I realized that the backs of their heads look just like the ghosts in the Pac-Man video game, down to the exact same color shades. Once I noticed this, I could not unsee it. After you read this review, you will not be able to unsee it either. You're welcome.\n\nUnfortunately for Madeleine, however, she will never outrun these ghosts.

I liked the vibe here. It's just kind of a hang.\n\nWe get the story of Madeline, a woman who seems to be having issues stemming from her miscarriage. We don't get a lot of details. We get a great opening dream sequence. She's married to a man who loves horses. Unless they aren't married. She picks up a hitchhiker and brings him home for a dip in the pool, both literally and as a euphemism. She gets romantic with her husband's son. Only he doesn't know they are married (and, again, maybe they‚Ä¶\n\nAn interesting pick in the Camille Keaton box set, neither a horror, gothic or otherwise, a giallo or a thriller. No, this is a rare film that had less than 40 votes on imdb or letterboxd that may fall into quasi psychedelia, psychosexual art house bleeding its heart out from the inside and then topping itself off with a plot twist. That's funny because a twist in this lackadaisical summer is almost redundant as the narrative.\n\nI think - or thought - this film was trying to evoke a feeling, a sensation through its nympho lead and her being stuck in a reality that has no consequences. She admits to feeling enslaved by an invisible chain, but to whom it‚Ä¶"
