        "text": "LOS ANGELES, Sept. 16 - The movie producer Sid Luft, who helped revive the career of Judy Garland, then his wife, in the 1950's, died on Thursday in Santa Monica. He was 89.\n\nThe cause was apparently a heart attack, said John Kimble, a longtime friend and business partner of Mr. Luft's.\n\nMr. Luft's production credits included \"Kilroy Was Here\" (1947), \"French Leave\" (1948) and most notably \"A Star Is Born\" (1954), starring Garland.\n\nMr. Luft and Garland were married in 1952 and divorced a tumultuous 13 years later. The marriage was Garland's third and Mr. Luft's second.\n\nThey had two children together, Lorna in 1952 and Joey in 1955. Mr. Luft was also stepfather to the singer and actress Liza Minnelli, whom Garland had with the director Vincente Minnelli in 1946.\n\nLuft helped resurrect Garland's career after she was released from her contract at MGM in 1950 after a series of personal and professional crises. It was at MGM that she had become a star and made films like \"The Wizard of Oz\" and \"Meet Me in St. Louis.\"\n\n\"A Star Is Born,\" produced by Mr. Luft and directed by George Cukor, brought Garland an Academy Award nomination for best actress. The oft-filmed story of a troubled movie star whose career is overshadowed by that of his protégée and wife, it also got five other nominations, including for best actor (James Mason), best score and best song.\n\nBut Mr. Luft's marriage to Garland was characterized by numerous separations. At their divorce hearing in 1965, Garland told a judge that Mr. Luft was an abusive husband.\n\n\"He struck me many times,\" Garland told Judge Edward R. Brand of Superior Court. \"He did a lot of drinking.\" In 1993, when Mr. Luft tried to auction the 1939 Oscar that Garland won as best juvenile actress for her performance in \"The Wizard of Oz,\" the Academy of Motion Pictures Arts and Sciences sued and won. The academy claimed it had the right to buy the Oscar -- for $10."
