        "text": "A Century of Film\n\nMetro-Goldwyn-Mayer\n\nThe Studio\n\nIn 1924, Loew’s was one of the most prominent studios in Hollywood. It had a massive studio chain and with Metro Pictures, a production company that was providing a good share of films to fill them. But Metro’s films had been slipping and Lee Shubert, whose theater chains were big on stage but less so in Hollywood, happened to be a board member of both Loew’s and Goldwyn Pictures, the studio formed by Samuel Goldwyn but which he had departed in 1922. Goldwyn wasn’t in great shape and its mascot (Leo the Lion) was better known than most of its stars (the biggest being Will Rogers); a long explanation of Leo’s history as the mascot can be found here. A merger became imminent but they needed someone better than anyone available at Metro or Goldwyn to run the studio.\n\nEnter Louis B. Mayer who had a strong hand in management and had been making films for his own independent production company. Loew’s would be the parent company, absorbing both Goldwyn and Mayer’s independent company and the combined new studio, with a large roster of talent and a steady hand at the helm would be christened Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer but would soon be known primarily as MGM.\n\nFrom the start, it was a massive hit. The craftsmen were solid, the directors and writers were workhorses, but the studio was loaded, not just with acting talent, but with stars. “More Stars Than There Are in Heaven” was the slogan and they lived up to it. In 1925, the studio released two of the most successful films released up to that point: The Big Parade and Ben-Hur.\n\nNorma Shearer would become a star at the end of the Silent Era and continue over into talkies at the same time that the studio brought over Greta Garbo from Sweden and developed Joan Crawford and Clark Gable. And when the features weren’t the big selling point, they had Hal Roach shorts (including Laurel and Hardy and Our Gang) and Tom and Jerry cartoons. Then came the arrival of the young prodigy, Irving Thalberg, who would marry Shearer and become the most prominent producer in Hollywood, knowing which films would make money and when he could occasionally spend more money on a quality product that wouldn’t have quite the same rate of return.\n\nWithin a decade the studio had expanded, with 23 sound stages over 117 acres and 4000 employees run by Mayer like a large family with him as the stern head. But the studio felt its first serious blow when Thalberg died in 1936 and Shearer retreated from films a few years later, followed a year later by the retirement of Garbo. They had young stars ready to replace them with Mickey Rooney and Judy Garland and Greer Garson arrived from England to become a huge star and Oscar darling.\n\nOver the course of the 40’s, Mayer would clash with Dore Schary, the former production chief of RKO who had been brought in to replace Thalberg. By the end of the decade the tension was too much and when Mayer finally confronted his boss Joseph Schenck in 1951 demanding that he had to choose, one third of the studio’s name was gone (with Schary himself staying on only five more years). At the same time, Loew’s was forced to divest itself of the studio so that it could continue to own its theater chain. MGM had completely toppled. This would be reflected in the number of films (over 450 in the 30’s, well over 300 in the 40’s and 50’s, just over 250 in the 60’s).\n\nThe studio would continue on through the 60’s but without the same level of quality and with other focuses (such as their casino in Las Vegas) and eventually, in 1973, MGM decided it would no longer be a film distributor. The studio made a complicated deal with United Artists so that UA would distribute the films (with the MGM name still on them) until 1981 at which point UA, riven by the financial fall-out from Heaven’s Gate would actually merge with MGM forming MGM/UA. For the next 20 years, both studios would continue to reduce their output (while often releasing films as MGM/UA but with one exception, The Secret of Nimh, which really was a joint production, each film was either an MGM or a UA production) until, in the 90’s, neither was doing much of anything and eventually both would stop making films altogether.\n\nOne thing to bear in mind about MGM – it was very much the kind of studio that Disney is today. It produced films that the public absolutely ate up, no matter how well they were received. Yet, many of those films, while massive hits, are not considered at nearly the same level today. They were popular but that doesn’t necessarily mean they were great. MGM won nine Best Picture Oscars but five of those aren’t on the TSPDT Top 2000 list and only 11 of their 48 Best Picture nominees are on that list.\n\nNotable Films:\n\nHe Who Gets Slapped – first MGM film\n\nThe Torrent – Garbo makes her US debut\n\nThe Barrier – the first Lionel Barrymore film for MGM, beginning 28 years with the studio\n\nWhite Shadows in the South Seas – first film where Leo the Lion roars\n\nHallelujah – the first all-black film from MGM\n\nThe Broadway Melody – MGM’s first all-sound film\n\nThe Unholy Three – Lon Chaney’s only talkie and last film\n\nGrand Hotel – the first “all-star” MGM film\n\nGone with the Wind – the biggest film in studio history for both awards and box office\n\nA Two-Faced Woman – the last Garbo film\n\nWoman of the Year – the first Hepburn-Tracy film\n\nBetrayed – the last Gable film for MGM\n\nJailhouse Rock – Elvis comes to films\n\nAndy Hardy Comes Homes – the final Andy Hardy movie\n\nBen-Hur – second to Gone with the Wind for both box office and awards acclaim\n\nThe Directors\n\nMGM is tricky because there are a lot of directors for whom I have seen at least the vast majority of their films that just aren’t all that good. Because MGM was a powerhouse of a studio, a lot of their directors earned at least one Oscar nomination (or more than one) and thus I tried to see all of their work for my Oscar Director project. But most of them didn’t deserve that nomination or, if they deserved it, didn’t have a worthwhile career (in terms of the quality of their films) outside of that nomination. So, to start this out, I will list all of those directors up front in order of their Oscar Director ranking. To point out the difference between the MGM contract directors and those who made a film at MGM, the directors who aren’t in bold (with the film listed after them) aren’t listed below the list because they made just the one or very few films at MGM.\n\n#1 – Stanley Kubrick (2001)\n\n#8 – David Lean (Dr. Zhivago)\n\n#16 – John Huston (The Asphalt Jungle)\n\n#20 – William Wyler (Mrs. Miniver, Ben Hur)\n\n#21 – Sidney Lumet (Network)\n\n#31 – Ridley Scott (Thelma & Louise)\n\n#42 – Fred Zinnemann (The Search)\n\n#54 – George Cukor\n\n#80 – Richard Brooks\n\n#92 – William Wellman (Battleground)\n\n#102 – Norman Jewison (Moonstruck)\n\n#107 – Charles Crichton (A Fish Called Wanda)\n\n#108 – Vincente Minnelli\n\n#109 – Mervyn LeRoy\n\n#111 – King Vidor\n\n#114 – John Sturges\n\n#119 – Victor Fleming\n\n#124 – Frank Lloyd\n\n#128 – Sam Wood\n\n#139 – W.S. Van Dyke\n\n#146 – Clarence Brown\n\n#165 – Mike Figgis (Leaving Las Vegas)\n\n#180 – Robert Z. Leonard\n\n#187 – Charles Walters\n\n#188 – Sidney Franklin\n\n#193 – Norman Taurog\n\n#200 – Lionel Barrymore (Madame X)\n\n#203 – Harry Beaumont\n\nSo look at that list – only two contract directors made the Top 100 while Warners had John Huston and Michael Curtiz, Columbia had Capra, RKO had Welles (briefly), UA had Chaplin and Wyler, Paramount had Wilder and Fox had Ford. What’s more, Cukor and Brooks earned only one nomination each at MGM while earning multiple nominations elsewhere (and both won Oscars for other studios). MGM had the biggest stars but for directors, they mostly had midling talent. But somehow I suspect both Mayer and Thalberg wanted it that way.\n\nHarry Beaumont\n\nFilms: 21\n\nYears: 1928 – 1948\n\nAverage Film: 57.9\n\nBest Film: When Ladies Meet\n\nWorst Film: The Broadway Melody\n\nBeaumont was the second director from MGM to earn an Oscar nomination and the first to have his film win Best Picture though it is widely regarded as one of the worst or even the worst Best Picture winner in history. He stayed at the studio for two more decades but rarely rose above mediocrity.\n\nRichard Brooks\n\nFilms: 14\n\nYears: 1950 – 1985\n\nAverage Film: 67.1\n\nBest Film: Cat on a Hot Tin Roof\n\nWorst Film: Fever Pitch\n\nBrooks moved from screenwriting into directing at the studio and he would make his best film at the studio but he would also leave at the end of the 50’s returning for just two more films and it was after he left that he found real critical and Oscar success.\n\nClarence Brown\n\nFilms: 33\n\nYears: 1927 – 1952\n\nAverage Film: 63.6\n\nBest Film: Of Human Hearts\n\nWorst Film: A Free Soul\n\nHow bad a sign is it that two of the first three directors listed earned Oscar nominations for their worst films. Brown was a mainstay at the studio for a long time and earned a whopping six Oscar nominations (while only two of his films were nominated). He made 14 films at the studio that combined for 35 Oscar nominations but, while most of his films were good, none rose above high ***.\n\nTod Browning\n\nFilms: 13\n\nYears: 1925 – 1936\n\nAverage Film: 70.9\n\nBest Film: Freaks\n\nWorst Film: Fast Works\n\nBrowning made two very good films at the studio (The Unholy Three, Freaks) and no bad ones so it’s ironic that the best film of his career was made at Universal (Dracula). Of the seven surviving films he made at the studio with Lon Chaney, all of them are high *** or better.\n\nJack Conway\n\nFilms: 25\n\nYears: 1930 – 1948\n\nAverage Film: 62.5\n\nBest Film: A Tale of Two Cities\n\nWorst Film: Viva Villa\n\nConway is almost unique in the history of the Academy Awards. Thanks to years of more Picture nominees than Director nominees (32-43, 09-present) plus films that were nominated for Picture without Director in the 5 BP Era there have been over 200 films now that have earned a Picture nomination without a Director nomination. But there have only been 9 directors who have had more than one film nominated for Picture without ever receiving an Oscar nomination for Best Director. Jack Conway is one of just two directors to do it three times (Edmund Goulding is the other): Viva Villa, A Tale of Two Cities and Libeled Lady. And to be fair, I don’t think he ever deserved a nomination (A Tale of Two Cities is my #5 in 1936 but is beaten out in director by Fritz Lang, also for an MGM film, Fury). Conway made more good films than mediocre ones and only a couple of bad ones but Tale is above *** and only Libeled Lady makes it to high ***.\n\nGeorge Cukor\n\nFilms: 21\n\nYears: 1932 – 1981\n\nAverage Film: 72.1\n\nBest Film: The Philadelphia Story\n\nWorst Film: A Woman’s Face\n\nCukor first came to MGM in the 30’s following David O. Selznick who he had worked for at RKO. From the next 25 years while the bulk of the films he made were at MGM including some of his best (Dinner at Eight, The Philadelphia Story, Gaslight) he only earned one Oscar nomination for the studio while earning multiple ones elsewhere. Still, even with the rare Oscar success elsewhere, Cukor was the best of MGM’s directors, making only one mediocre film and no bad ones while making a lot of good or really good ones. He even put in work on two of MGM’s biggest films: The Wizard of Oz and Gone with the Wind.\n\nVictor Fleming\n\nFilms: 14\n\nYears: 1932 – 1945\n\nAverage Film: 63.1\n\nBest Film: The Wizard of Oz\n\nWorst Film: Wet Parade\n\nVictor Fleming should be double grateful to Cukor because Cukor’s commitment to Gone with the Wind meant he left The Wizard of Oz and then when Gable objected, Fleming replaced the fired Cukor there as well. If not for those two films his MGM average drops to 58.0 and he loses his Oscar win. Fleming made a couple of solid films (A Guy Named Joe, Red Dust) which would both have better remakes and did a lot of filler.\n\nSidney Franklin\n\nFilms: 13\n\nYears: 1927 – 1957\n\nAverage Film: 63.9\n\nBest Film: Wild Orchids\n\nWorst Film: The Lady of Scandal\n\nThree Best Picture nominations (Smilin Through, The Barretts of Wimpole Street, The Good Earth), the last earning Franklin himself a nomination is really all that earns him a place here. His 13 films have a tight range between 69 and 56, so not bad but not all that good either.\n\nRobert Z. Leonard\n\nFilms: 45\n\nYears: 1924 – 1955\n\nAverage Film: 59.5\n\nBest Film: Pride and Prejudice\n\nWorst Film: The Great Diamond Robbery\n\nWell over half of Leonard’s films are subpar (21 **.5 films, 5 ** films) while only one is better than a 72 (Pride and Prejudice). But he was a workhorse for the studio, earned two Oscar nominations (The Divorcee, The Great Ziegfeld), won the studio a Best Picture and I’ve seen at least one MGM film directed by him for every year from 1928 to 1955 with some years having as many as three.\n\nMervyn LeRoy\n\nFilms: 19\n\nYears: 1931 – 1954\n\nAverage Film: 62.9\n\nBest Film: Random Harvest\n\nWorst Film: Little Women\n\nFirst, I’ve always thought LeRoy was a bit overrated. Second, his best films were when he was still at Warners early in the 30’s (he made two early films for MGM but didn’t really come over the studio until 1938. Third, he might have produced The Wizard of Oz but he didn’t direct it. Fourth, of his four Best Picture nominees at MGM three of them absolutely didn’t deserve it (Blossoms in the Dust, Madame Curie, Quo Vadis) while the fourth, which also earned him an Oscar nom (Random Harvest) was very good and easily the best of his MGM career but still not up to Oscar level.\n\nVincente Minnelli\n\nFilms: 30\n\nYears: 1943 – 1965\n\nAverage Film: 66.0\n\nBest Film: The Bad and the Beautiful\n\nWorst Film: Undercurrent\n\nHe made all but three of his final four films at MGM but he’s another director I have always felt was overrated. His best film didn’t get him an Oscar nom while the mediocre Gigi won him an Oscar and the over-rated An American in Paris won Best Picture. His films were generally pretty good (14 of his 30 films at the studio are a 69 or higher) but Home from the Hill is the only other film I rate above ***.\n\nGeorge B. Seitz\n\nFilms: 16\n\nYears: 1933 – 1943\n\nAverage Film: 61.6\n\nBest Film: Andy Hardy’s Private Secretary\n\nWorst Film: Lazy River\n\nThough I have only seen 16 of his films, Seitz was a workhorse for MGM for years before he directed A Family Affair. That was the first of the Andy Hardy films and it gave him continued employment at MGM for the rest of his life (Seitz died in 1944), directing 11 of the first 14 films in the series before his death and they were basically all better than any of the films I’ve seen direct outside of the series.\n\nGeorge Sidney\n\nFilms: 16\n\nYears: 1943 – 1964\n\nAverage Film: 64.4\n\nBest Film: Anchors Aweigh\n\nWorst Film: Key to the City\n\nSidney was one of the studio’s key directors for Musicals, covering nine of the 16 films I’ve seen from him (what’s more, he also directed Gene Kelly in the non-Musical version of The Three Musketeers). Nine of his films did combine for 21 Oscar nominations but the only above the line nominations were Picture and Actor for Anchors Aweigh.\n\nJohn Sturges\n\nFilms: 14\n\nYears: 1950 – 1968\n\nAverage Film: 65.4\n\nBest Film: Bad Day at Black Rock\n\nWorst Film: Fast Company\n\nSturges spent the 50’s at the studio, mostly with mediocre Dramas though he somehow broke through to real quality (and an Oscar nomination) for Bad Day at Black Rock. Sturges would leave in 1960 for UA where he made The Magnificent Seven and The Great Escape (the films he’s really known for) before returning just once to direct Ice Station Zebra.\n\nNorman Taurog\n\nFilms: 26\n\nYears: 1938 – 1968\n\nAverage Film: 58.7\n\nBest Film: Lucky Night\n\nWorst Film: The Beginning or the End\n\nTaurog is the ultimate example of mediocrity in directing. He made 26 films at MGM and with one exception (his worst film, a 48) they all land between 67 and 51. He had won his (very undeserved) Oscar before coming to MGM and earned another (undeserved) nomination for Boys Town before settling in with Musicals and light Comedies. He would finish his career at MGM by directing a bunch of Elvis’ late 60’s Musicals.\n\nRichard Thorpe\n\nFilms: 41\n\nYears: 1935 – 1967\n\nAverage Film: 60.3\n\nBest Film: Night Must Fall\n\nWorst Film: Wyoming\n\nUnlike most of the major directors who spent years at the studio, Thorpe never earned an Oscar nomination (though he didn’t deserve one) though there was one Best Picture nomination (Ivanhoe). Night Must Fall was his best film by a long way (5 points) but he only made two bad films (Toy Wife was the other) while he was mostly just mediocre. Between Tarzan films (four of them) and Arthurian type films, Thorpe was clearly the go-to director for Adventure films, directing 12 of them.\n\nW. S. Van Dyke\n\nFilms: 43\n\nYears: 1928 – 1942\n\nAverage Film: 63.2\n\nBest Film: The Thin Man\n\nWorst Film: Cuban Love Song\n\nVan Dyke was the real workhorse for the studio, making an astounding 43 films in under 15 years. Even with cancer and a bad heart he worked until the end, killing himself just after his last film was released at the age of 54. He wasn’t great but his films were more often good than not (25 of his films are *** or higher) and he could work in all genres, making four Thin Man films, a Tarzan film, an Andy Hardy film and making a wide variety of Dramas, Comedies and Musicals.\n\nKing Vidor\n\nFilms: 16\n\nYears: 1924 – 1944\n\nAverage Film: 64.3\n\nBest Film: Show People\n\nWorst Film: The Champ\n\nI consider Vidor over-rated at least in part because his big film (The Crowd) I think is very over-rated. But he could be good in Comedy (Show People), War (The Big Parade) or Drama (The Citadel) and he rarely made weak films.\n\nCharles Walters\n\nFilms: 20\n\nYears: 1947 – 1964\n\nAverage Film: 62.0\n\nBest Film: High Society\n\nWorst Film: Dangerous When Wet\n\nUnlike many of the directors listed here, Walters didn’t have a lot of range. Of the 20 films only three were Dramas and over half of them were Musicals (the rest were Comedies).\n\nSam Wood\n\nFilms: 23\n\nYears: 1929 – 1950\n\nAverage Film: 60.0\n\nBest Film: A Night at the Opera\n\nWorst Film: Lord Jeff\n\nWood was very prolific early on; I’ve seen 11 films he made for MGM between the advent of sound and the start of the Code. Unfortunately, all 11 of them are **.5 because he just wasn’t that good. After working for a few weeks on Gone with the Wind to help Victor Fleming recover from exhaustion, Wood left MGM and did his best work (Our Town, Kings Row, Pride of the Yankees, For the Whom the Bell Tolls) at other studios before returning for his last three films before dying in 1949 before the release of his last film, Ambush.\n\nThe Stars\n\nNorma Shearer\n\nShearer was already a rising star at the studio before she married Irving Thalberg but that took her right to the top. During the years that the Pre-Code films were hard to find, Shearer got a bad reputation for being boring but her Pre-Code films are risque and have an open sexuality that was then shut out of mainstream film for decades. The most beautiful of the MGM stars to me and one of the most talented. Sadly, many of her films didn’t rise to her talent.\n\nEssential Viewing: The Divorcee, A Free Soul, The Barretts of Wimpole Street, Romeo and Juliet\n\nClark Gable\n\nGable signed a contract in 1930, entered the Stars Poll in 1932 and was #2 most years from 1934 to 1942 with four different stars keeping him out of the top spot. Even with his star not as bright after the war, he stayed with MGM and continued to be one of their most prominent actors, not leaving the studio until his contract expired in 1934. The irony, of course, is that Gable won his Oscar on loan to Columbia but then again, it was Selznick’s need for Gable as Rhett that lead to Gone with the Wind being the studio’s biggest hit.\n\nEssential Viewing: Gone with the Wind, Mutiny on the Bounty, Red Dust\n\nGreta Garbo\n\nMGM brought Garbo over from Sweden in the mid 20’s and she quickly became a massive star with her gorgeous looks and great talent. Talking didn’t hold her back and she continued to be a big box office star and critical darling throughout the 30’s before she decided to leave acting behind.\n\nEssential Viewing: Anna Christie, Anna Karenina, Grand Hotel, Ninotchka\n\nWilliam Powell & Myrna Loy\n\nIn 1934, the studio decided to team Powell and Loy up to star as Nick and Nora Charles in The Thin Man. They would end up making six Thin Man films in all but it wasn’t just those films; they also made Libeled Lady, The Great Ziegfeld and Double Wedding together with the first Thin Man sequel all in less than a year. By the time they left the studio in the late 40’s they had made 14 films together.\n\nEssential Viewing: The Thin Man, After the Thin Man, The Great Ziegfeld, Libeled Lady\n\nJoan Crawford\n\nI have never liked Joan Crawford and never thought she was particularly good-looking. But there’s no denying she was a major star for MGM. She was the #1 star of 1930 and stayed in the Top 10 through 1937 and the men at MGM were all over her. Of course, after almost 20 years of being one of the studio’s biggest stars she left in 1943 went to Warners and won an Oscar.\n\nEssential Viewing: The Women, Grand Hotel, Our Dancing Daughters\n\nSpencer Tracy\n\nHe earned six Oscar nominations at the studio and won back-to-back Oscars in 1937 and 1938 so he can’t be discounted as a major part of the studio’s success. Another actor I’ve never been fond of, but I can’t deny his importance.\n\nEssential Viewing: Captains Courageous, Boys Town, Bad Day at Black Rock, Woman of the Year\n\nMickey Rooney\n\nThe number one box office star from 1939 to 1941, Rooney was also the anchor of a major studio series (Andy Hardy), stealing the first film and making the series all about him. He would also do a lot of films with the next person on the list.\n\nEssential Viewing: The Human Comedy, Babes in Arms, Love Finds Andy Hardy\n\nJudy Garland\n\nGarland, of course, rose through the ranks, doing things like being Andy Hardy’s love interest before breaking through with The Wizard of Oz. She was a major star throughout the 40’s, mostly in Musicals but her personal problems ended up with her being pushed out of the studio at the end of the decade.\n\nEssential Viewing: The Wizard of Oz, Meet Me in St. Louis, The Clock\n\nRobert Taylor\n\nI loathe Robert Taylor. He’s one of my least favorite actors of all-time because he was a terrible actor and he wasn’t good looking enough (like say Tyrone Power) to overcome that. But I can’t deny that 1 – he was a big star and 2 – he spent more years under contract to MGM (24, from 1934 to 1958) than any other star, making him a major part of the studio’s history.\n\nEssential Viewing: Johnny Eager, Waterloo Bridge, Quo Vadis\n\nGenres\n\nMGM is known for Musicals, of course. Through 1969, MGM accounts for about 15% of all the films I’ve seen but it accounts for 25% of the Musicals. But during that time it also accounts for 20% of all the Adventure films because those cost a lot of money (which MGM had) and good production values (which MGM also had). But outside of Adventure films, MGM didn’t do too much in the way of genre films (all films except Drama, Comedy or Musical). While the average comes out to about 37.5% of all the films I’ve seen are genre films, the MGM films are less than 30% genre films. It’s not even because of the trend towards more genre films in more recent decades; though over 2/3 of the MGM films I have seen (and that they made) are from before 1970, there are several genres (Action, Horror, Kids, Sci-Fi) in which well more than half of MGM’s output in those genres comes after that point. Among the genres, MGM is considerably above the average number for Adventure and below the average percentage for everything else. Musicals account for less than 6% of all films I’ve seen but over 12% at MGM (the number for all films is 8% for all films but 13.8% for MGM).\n\nOne thing MGM did was focus on some specific sub-genres. For instance, like many studios in the Studio Era, they made a lot of series films. They had two Comedy series (Andy Hardy, Maisie), a Drama series (Dr. Kildare), a Mystery series (The Thin Man) and they made a number of Tarzan films. The Tarzan films are interesting because they made six films from 1932 to 1942 before letting the franchise go, brought it back in 1957, making five more films by 1963 and then one more in 1981. In total, the studio made three different films called Tarzan the Ape Man (1932, 1959, 1981). They made a number of films with Comedy teams (12 Laurel & Hardy films, 5 Marx Brothers films and a couple of Abbott & Costello films). They also made the Elvis Musicals (11 in all). Aside from the Thin Man films, they made five Agatha Christie films in the 60’s (four Miss Marple films and one other film). What’s more, they were flush with literary properties. While covering a wide range of authors, the studio made at least three films each adapted from Dickens, Maugham, O’Neill, Shakespeare, Steinbeck, Stevenson, Tolstoy and Tennessee Williams (the latter being the best, four films that average an 84).\n\nThe Top 75 MGM Films\n\nThe Wizard of Oz\n\nSingin’ in the Rain\n\n2001: A Space Odyssey\n\nGreed\n\nDoctor Zhivago\n\nThe Philadelphia Story\n\nNorth by Northwest\n\nNetwork\n\nThe Bad and the Beautiful\n\nGaslight\n\nCat on a Hot Tin Roof\n\nA Fish Called Wanda\n\nMutiny on the Bounty (1935)\n\nThe Thin Man\n\nRide the High Country\n\nBad Day at Black Rock\n\nForbidden Planet\n\nFaust\n\nPoint Blank\n\nThe Asphalt Jungle\n\nPygmalion\n\nThelma & Louise\n\nThe Night of the Iguana\n\nLeaving Las Vegas\n\nThe Wind\n\nThe Americanization of Emily\n\nThe Shop Around the Corner\n\nDiner\n\nBen-Hur (1959)\n\nGone with the Wind\n\nA Tale of Two Cities\n\nGet Shorty\n\nDinner at Eight\n\nPat Garrett and Billy the Kid\n\nThe Sunshine Boys\n\nForce of Evil\n\nRonin\n\nNapoleon (1927)\n\nMy Favorite Year\n\nFreaks\n\nMerrily We Live\n\nLolita (1962)\n\nSeven Chances\n\nRandom Harvest\n\nThe Year of Living Dangerously\n\nPoltergeist\n\nPink Floyd: The Wall\n\nThe Four Days of Naples\n\nThe Comedians\n\nShoot the Moon\n\nHome from the Hill\n\nBen-Hur (1925)\n\nAct of Violence\n\nFury\n\nLaugh Clown Laugh\n\nThe Merry Widow (1925)\n\nSweet Bird of Youth\n\nThe Actress\n\nThe Mighty Quinn\n\nA Night at the Opera\n\nShow People\n\nThe Naked Spur\n\nThe Goodbye Girl\n\nWoman of the Year\n\nThe Indian Runner\n\nDeath at a Funeral (2007)\n\nThe Unholy Three (1925)\n\nThe Search\n\nAnchors Aweigh\n\nCameraman\n\nEntre Nous\n\nThe Blackboard Jungle\n\nThe Secret of Nimh\n\nTravels with My Aunt\n\nMoonstruck\n\nnote: The first 36 films are ****.

The films are listed in alphabetical order. Unless I have something specific to say, I don’t mention films that have full reviews elsewhere or films that I saw in the theater from 1989 to 2005 (they are all mentioned in those Nighthawk Awards).\n\nBrewster McCloud – How much had MGM changed if this very odd film got made there. A perfect example of why Altman wasn’t made for Hollywood unless he was ripping it to shreds.\n\nThe Clock – Minnelli made a good film directing his future wife Judy Garland in her first dramatic role (and first in which she doesn’t sing) and then they were promptly told to never do it again. See it if you can.\n\nDeath at a Funeral – Darkly hilarious British Comedy directed by Frank Oz of all people.\n\nDiner – A film so funny and enjoyable that even the death-like unfunny combination of Paul Reiser and Steve Guttenberg can’t bring it down.\n\nThe Fearless Vampire Killers – The best way to appreciate Sharon Tate onscreen (since The Wrecking Crew is mostly unavailable) is this enjoyable Vampire Comedy.\n\nHe Who Gets Slapped – Lon Chaney and Norma Shearer. A movie I re-watch whenever it airs on TCM.\n\nLove Finds Andy Hardy – Not the best of the series but my favorite because it makes good use of Judy Garland.\n\nLudwig – Some think it’s brilliant but it’s just a giant mess of a film from a sometimes great director (Luchino Visconti). But it makes great visual use of one of my favorite places (even if I’ve never been there): Neuschwanstein.\n\nMystery Street – Underrated Mystery filmed in Boston and starring Ricardo Montalban.\n\nThe Naked Spur – When critics talk about how good Anthony Mann was at making Westerns this is the kind of film they’re talking about.\n\nPat Garrett and Billy the Kid – Near the top of the list for Westerns I haven’t reviewed and now near the top of the list for MGM films I haven’t reviewed. It’s a great film with an even better soundtrack.\n\nPink Floyd: The Wall – I don’t take drugs and I’ve always loved it.\n\nThe Pirate – Gene Kelly and Judy Garland. ’nuff said.\n\nPoltergeist – I’m one of those who’ve always bought into the idea this was mostly directed by Spielberg because it feels like one of his films and I’ve never thought Tobe Hooper even showed anything like this kind of talent.\n\nSoylent Green – Several years ago now, we were driving with my sister and saw a “Soylent Green is people!” bumper sticker and she was confused and I explained it. To her, only film buffs knew that and it was a niche bumper sticker while V and I explained that it was a widely known cultural moment (which she refused to believe and claimed V only knew it because she was married to me). Ironically, I don’t think I had even seen the film at that point. V, by the way, drinks Soylent all the time and every time she does I accuse her of cannibalism. She loves being married to me.\n\nWestworld – It pales now because of the show which is so much more brilliant in its story-telling and its effects but it was a rather revolutionary concept at the time and is still well worth watching.\n\nThe 10 Most Under-Rated MGM Films\n\nThese are all films that I rate at **** or high ***.5 that have never appeared in TSPDT’s Top 1000 (now 2000) or their Top 250 21st Century Films (now 1000). Also, I eliminated a few films that were nominated for Best Picture (Cat on a Hot Tin Roof, Pygmalion, A Tale of Two Cities).

From 1931 to the present, most years are above 70% and all but two years (1935, 1973) are above 64%. What’s more, in the week following this post, thanks to TCM, 1929 itself will go over 50%, 1930 will go over 60%, 1931 will go over 70% and the 30’s as a whole will go over 70%. I have 10 films from MGM that I have never seen just set to record on my DVR next week alone. This post is going up because it’s the appropriate next studio to cover after UA (which merged with MGM in the 70’s) not because I’m really done with it.\n\nnote: Because most box office information before 1980 is spotty and I have seen most of the MGM films since 1980, the highest grossing MGM film listed on Box Office Mojo that I haven’t seen is A Guy Thing, the #92 MGM film at $15.54 million.\n\nBiggest Years:\n\n1933: 44\n\n1950: 39\n\n1939, 1942: 37\n\n1934: 35\n\nnote: MGM has the most films I’ve seen from any studio in almost every single year up through 1952.\n\nBiggest Years by Percentage of All Films:\n\n1929: 28.00%\n\n1930: 27.59%\n\n1932: 24.41%\n\n1934: 23.18%\n\n1950: 23.08%\n\nEras:\n\nTop 10 Most Films every year from 1926 to 1973\n\nMGM starts with the most films in the very first year. It becomes the first studio over 100 total films in 1930, the first with over 500 films in 1942 and the first with 1000 in 1963 by which point it is several hundred films above any other studio. It would take the massive drop in production in the mid 70’s for other studios to start catching up. The first studio back within 300 films is in 1978, the first within 200 is in 1994. Fox would get within 100 films in 2004 and would actually pass MGM in 2008.\n\nBest Years:\n\n1929: 3 in the Top 10, 7 in the Top 20\n\n1938: 3 in the Top 10, 6 in the Top 20\n\n1926 / 1944: 3 in the Top 10, 5 in the Top 20\n\nThe Top Films:\n\nNighthawk Winner: 1926, 1934, 1939, 1965, 1968\n\n3 Films in the Top 10: 1926, 1929, 1936, 1938, 1944\n\n5 Films in the Top 20: 1926-29, 1938, 1942, 1944, 1953\n\nTop 10 Films: 53\n\nFirst Year in the Top 10: 1926\n\nLatest Year in the Top 10: 1995\n\nTop 20 Films: 111\n\nBest Decade for Top 20 Films: 1930’s (31)\n\nWorst Decade for Top 20 Films: 2000’s (0)\n\nAverage Film By Decade:\n\n1919-1929: 69.74\n\n1930-1939: 61.54\n\n1940-1949: 61.92\n\n1950-1959: 61.85\n\n1960-1969: 59.07\n\n1970-1979: 53.72\n\n1980-1989: 48.48\n\n1990-1999: 45.19\n\n2000-2006: 45.76\n\nTOTAL: 59.10\n\nnote: As always with a chart like this, it does beg the question of whether older films are better (or just fewer older films are bad) or whether the ones that are worse are simply harder to find.\n\nBest Years for Average Film:\n\n1926: 71.45\n\n1928: 68.90\n\n1929: 68.19\n\n1949: 64.92\n\n1956: 63.79\n\nWorst Years for Average Film (minimum 5 films):\n\n1996: 34.13\n\n1998: 34.33\n\n2004: 37.33\n\nStar Rating:\n\nnote: The percentage breakdown for all MGM films by star rating.\n\n****: 2.59%\n\n***.5: 3.31%\n\n***: 44.96%\n\n**.5: 30.84%\n\n**: 13.04%\n\n*.5: 1.66%\n\n*: 2.23%\n\n.5: 1.30%\n\n0: 0.01%\n\nNighthawk Awards\n\nNumber of Films That Have Earned Nominations: 188\n\nNumber of Films That Have Won Nighthawks: 54\n\nNumber of Films With Multiple Nominations: 96\n\nNumber of Films With Multiple Wins: 19\n\nBest Picture Nominations: 20\n\nTotal Number of Nominations: 513\n\nTotal Number of Wins: 111\n\nCategory With the Most Nominations: Actress (48)\n\nDirector with Most Nighthawk Nominated Films: George Cukor (11)\n\nBest Film with No Nighthawks: Ride the High Country\n\nBest Film with No Nighthawk Nominations: Seven Chances\n\nNumber of Films That Have Earned Drama Nominations: 83\n\nNumber of Films That Have Earned Comedy Nominations: 67\n\nNumber of Films That Have Won Drama Awards: 23\n\nNumber of Films That Have Won Comedy Awards: 29\n\nDrama Picture Nominations: 19\n\nComedy Picture Nominations: 27\n\nTotal Number of Drama Nominations: 195\n\nTotal Number of Comedy Nominations: 202\n\nTotal Number of Drama Wins: 37\n\nTotal Number of Comedy Wins: 62\n\nCategory With the Most Nominations: Actress (36 – Drama / 37 – Comedy)\n\nBest Drama Film With No Nominations: Pat Garrett and Billy the Kid\n\nBest Comedy Film With No Nominations: Death at a Funeral\n\nMost 2nd Place Finishes: Gone with the Wind (6)\n\nMost 6th Place Finishes: A Tale of Two Cities / Night Must Fall / Act of Violence / The Americanization of Emily (3)\n\nMost Top 10 Finishes: The Wizard of Oz (21)\n\nMost Top 20 Finishes: The Wizard of Oz (21)\n\nFilms With at Least One Top 10 Finish: 262\n\nBest Film Without a Top 10 Finish: Home from the Hill\n\nFilms With at Least One Top 20 Finish: 315\n\nBest Film Without a Top 20 Finish: The Big Parade\n\nMost Nighthawk Nominations:\n\nThe Wizard of Oz – 18\n\nDoctor Zhivago – 14\n\nGone with the Wind – 13\n\nGaslight – 12\n\nSingin’ in the Rain – 12\n\nMutiny on the Bounty – 10\n\n2001: A Space Odyssey – 10\n\nThe Thin Man – 9\n\nBen-Hur – 9\n\nNetwork – 9\n\nMost Nighthawks:\n\nThe Wizard of Oz – 14\n\nDoctor Zhivago – 9\n\n2001: A Space Odyssey – 9\n\nGreed – 5\n\nThe Thin Man / Gaslight / Ben-Hur – 5\n\nMost Nighthawk Points:\n\nThe Wizard of Oz – 795\n\nDoctor Zhivago – 660\n\n2001: A Space Odyssey – 510\n\nGaslight – 500\n\nThe Thin Man – 490\n\nGone with the Wind – 405\n\nGreed – 400\n\nNetwork – 400\n\nThe Philadelphia Story – 350\n\nMutiny on the Bounty – 340\n\nMost Drama Nominations:\n\nNetwork – 8\n\nThe Night of the Iguana – 7\n\nseven films – 6\n\nMost Comedy Nominations:\n\nDinner at Eight – 7\n\nThe Wizard of Oz – 7\n\nThe Philadelphia Story – 7\n\nSingin’ in the Rain – 7\n\nfive films – 6\n\nMost Drama Wins:\n\nGreed – 4\n\nDoctor Zhivago – 4\n\nGaslight – 3\n\n2001: A Space Odyssey – 3\n\nfour films – 2\n\nMost Comedy Wins:\n\nThe Wizard of Oz – 6\n\nThe Thin Man – 5\n\nThe Philadelphia Story – 5\n\nSingin’ in the Rain – 5\n\nfive films – 3\n\nMost Drama Points:\n\nDoctor Zhivago – 395\n\nNetwork – 375\n\nGaslight – 335\n\nGreed – 330\n\nCat on a Hot Tin Roof / The Night of the Iguana – 300\n\nMost Comedy Points:\n\nThe Wizard of Oz – 490\n\nSingin’ in the Rain – 455\n\nThe Philadelphia Story – 450\n\nThe Thin Man – 410\n\nDinner at Eight – 355\n\nAll-Time Nighthawk Awards\n\nBest Picture\n\nThe Wizard of Oz\n\nSingin’ in the Rain\n\n2001: A Space Odyssey\n\nGreed\n\nDoctor Zhivago\n\nAnalysis: The full list can be seen above. Five films win the Nighthawk (Singin doesn’t but Thin Man does). Another 15 films earn Nighthawk noms. Overall, 54 films land in the Top 10 in their respective years with 107 total making the Top 20. In Drama, Greed, Zhivago and 2001 are winners with 16 other nominees while Thin Man, Wizard, Philadelphia Story, Anchors Aweigh and Singin win the Comedy award with 22 other nominees. North by Northwest and A Fish Called Wanda, which are 17 and 16 points higher than Anchors Aweigh don’t win the Comedy award because of much tougher years.\n\nOf course, MGM was big at the Oscars. After talking the Academy out of awarding The Crowd (which Mayer didn’t like) in the first Oscars, the studio would win Best Picture six times over the following fourteen years. After a gap of almost a decade, the studio would win three more in the 50’s but that was it. After 1959, though it would earn six more nominations, MGM would never again win Best Picture. In total, 57 films from MGM earned Best Picture noms and it was in 1st place in total Picture points from 1929 to 1992 and still sits in a tie for 4th even though it hasn’t had a nomination since 1987.\n\nOnly two films have won the Globe – Drama (Ben Hur, Zhivago) while six have won in Comedy or Musical (American in Paris, Guys and Dolls, Les Girls, Gigi, Sunshine Boys, Goodbye Girl). In addition, 12 films have earned Drama noms (though only Network, Thelma and Louise and Leaving Las Vegas since 1968) and 25 in Comedy including four in 1962 (Period of Adjustment, Boys Night Out, Wonderful World of Brothers Grimm, Billie Rose’s Jumbo) and three in 1982 (Victor/Victoria, My Favorite Year, Diner).\n\nOnly two films have earned BAFTA noms for British Film (Shiralee, The Hill) but a whopping 28 have earned regular Picture noms, 20 of them in the 50’s, including the only winner (Ben Hur). There have been two PGA nominees, both in 1995 (Leaving Las Vegas, Get Shorty).\n\nMGM was always the popular studio, not the critically acclaimed one which is why after The Citadel somehow won both the NYFC and NBR it would take almost 60 years before another MGM film won more than one critics award (Leaving Las Vegas) though in between six films managed to win one each.\n\nBest Director\n\nStanley Kubrick (2001: A Space Odyssey)\n\nDavid Lean (Doctor Zhivago)\n\nVictor Fleming (The Wizard of Oz)\n\nErich von Stroheim (Greed)\n\nGeorge Cukor (Gaslight)\n\nAnalysis: Five films win the Nighthawk (the same five that win Picture). Another 20 films earn a Nighthawk nomination though 8 of those didn’t earn Picture noms. There are four Drama winners (Greed, Bad Day at Black Rock, Zhivago, 2001) and three Comedy winners (Thin Man, Wizard, Singin) with another 21 Drama and 20 Comedy nominees.\n\nIn spite of winning Best Picture nine times, only four MGM films have won Best Director at the Oscars: Gone with the Wind, Mrs. Miniver, Gigi, Ben Hur. There have been 36 nominees as well, though, again, they don’t correspond well to Picture (one Picture winner wasn’t nominated and only 14 of the Director nominees weren’t from Picture nominees). From 1932 to 1944, MGM had a whopping 17 Picture nominees without a Director nomination. In the 5 BP Era, MGM had two films win Picture and Director, one film win Picture without Director, 10 films nominated for Picture without Director, 9 films nominated for Director without Picture but only six films nominated for Picture and Director without a win. Since the last Picture nom, MGM has had three Director nominations (A Fish Called Wanda, Thelme and Louise, Leaving Las Vegas).\n\nMGM has been lackluster at the Globes, winning four times (Gigi, Ben Hur, Zhivago, Network) and earning only 9 other nominations with only Leaving Las Vegas since 1965.\n\nMGM’s heyday was gone before the BAFTAs introduced a Director award in 1968 so only five films have earned noms with no winners: Ryan’s Daughter, Network, Fame, Fish Called Wanda, Thelma & Louise.\n\nMGM has won the DGA just twice (Gigi, Ben Hur) but has earned 18 other nominations, most recently Leaving Las Vegas. Leaving would also won two critics awards, or as many as all MGM films won through 1975. In total, just five MGM films have won a critics award (Asphalt Jungle, Boy Friend, Network, Sunday in the Country, Leaving Las Vegas).\n\nBest Adapted Screenplay:\n\nThe Wizard of Oz\n\nThe Philadelphia Story\n\nGreed\n\nDoctor Zhivago\n\nCat on a Hot Tin Roof\n\nAnalysis: Four films win the Nighthawk (Greed, Thin Man, Wizard, Zhivago) with another 23 nominations. There are only three Drama winners (Greed, Citadel, Zhivago) but five Comedy winners (Thin Man, Wizard, Philadelphia, State of the Union, Lolita). There are also 20 Drama nominees and 12 Comedy nominees.\n\nLike many categories, MGM did well here for a while then just died out. The studio won 8 Oscars by 1965 and no more after that. It also earned 29 nominations though just four of those came after 1965. MGM had The Bad and the Beautiful, the only film until 1996 to win the Oscar without a Picture nomination.\n\nThere have been more Globe winners in their Screenplay category (7) than nominees (6) including three winners early on before it was a regular category and the first regular winner (Zhivago). There have been 10 BAFTA nominees (six before the Adapted / Original split) and none have won the award. Sixteen films won the WGA before the Adapted / Original split. Three more won Adapted during the genre split years with no winners since the merge. In total, including all winners and nominees, 83 MGM films have earned noms at the WGA.\n\nBest Original Screenplay:\n\nA Fish Called Wanda\n\nNetwork\n\nSingin’ in the Rain\n\n2001: A Space Odyssey\n\nNorth by Northwest\n\nAnalysis: It takes until 1976 for MGM to win the Nighthawk here (Network) and then it wins just one more (Fish). On the other hand, the 21 nominees range from 1928 to 1991. Aside from Network, Fury and 2001 win the Drama award while A Night at the Opera, Ninotchka, Anchors Aweigh and Vacation from Marriage win weak years and North by Northwest and Fish win strong ones. There are only 8 other Drama nominees because original dramatic writing wasn’t a strength of the studio while there are 17 Comedy nominees.\n\nThere are 17 Oscar winners among the MGM films including two each in 1949 and 1955 (thanks to competing categories) and three films that won an Oscar here and earned a nomination in the ostensible “Adapted” category at the same time. Winners lasted longer here than in most categories thanks to Moonstruck and Thelma & Louise. There have also been 40 Oscar nominees including 10 in four years from 1950 to 1953. From 1946 to 1949, four MGM films won the Oscar but none earned a nomination without winning. Lars and the Real Girl, nominated in 2007, is the most recent MGM nominee in any category.\n\nSee above for some Globe, BAFTA and WGA info. Lars and the Real Girl earned a BFCA nom. After the split at the WGA, Network won during the genre years while Moonstruck, Thelma & Louise and Bowling for Columbine all have won in the current set-up. All three films to win critics awards (two for Network, one each for Diner and Lars and the Real Girl) were original.\n\nBest Actor:\n\nNicolas Cage (Leaving Las Vegas)\n\nCharles Laughton (Mutiny on the Bounty)\n\nClark Gable (Gone with the Wind)\n\nKirk Douglas (Lust for Life)\n\nWilliam Holden (Network)\n\nAnalysis: MGM wins five early Nighthawks (1929-44) then just Cage after that. There are also 22 other nominees including two from Network. In Drama, it wins four early ones as well as Cage’s win with 25 other nominees. In Comedy it dominates early on (8 wins by 1951) but only wins once more after that (Walter Matthau in Sunshine Boys) though its 22 nominations are much more spread out (1929-2007 with at least one every decade).\n\nMGM is the only studio to have a film with three nominees and none of them won (Mutiny on the Bounty). That was in the middle of a ten year stretch where MGM had six winners including four in a row from 37-40. After 1940, there would only be four more winners: Ben Hur, Network, The Goodbye Girl, Leaving Las Vegas. There are 36 nominees including the non-winner from Network and the three from Mutiny including 16 in the stretch from 1941 to 1958 when MGM had no winners.\n\nThe studio would win in Drama at the Globes roughly once a decade (1946, 1956, 1965, 1976, 1995) and quite a bit more often in Comedy (four time in the 50’s, twice each in the 60’s and 70’s then Get Shorty). Ironically, before 1981, they had only lost the Comedy award six times and the only time since 1963 was The Sunshine Boys (which lost to itself) but from 1981 to 2007 the studio would have 10 nominees without a win. In Drama, it would be all about the 60’s with two nominees before the decade, only two since (The Champ, Shoot the Moon) but six during the decade.\n\nThe Goodbye Girl is the only MGM film to simply win the BAFTA. Julius Caesar managed to win both British Actor and Foreign Actor while both Network and A Fish Called Wanda won the award and had a second nominee. Aside from those four, seventeen films have earned nominations but only three since the British / Foreign split was dropped in 1968 (Sunshine Boys, Shoot the Moon, Leaving Las Vegas).\n\nCage won SAG while Philip Seymour Hoffman (Flawless) and Ryan Gosling (Lars and the Real Girl) earned noms. Cage won all six critics awards while no other performance won more than one; eight different performances won one each.\n\nBest Actress\n\nVivien Leigh (Gone with the Wind)\n\nIngrid Bergman (Gaslight)\n\nKatharine Hepburn (The Philadelphia Story)\n\nElizabeth Taylor (Cat on a Hot Tin Roof)\n\nWendy Hiller (Pygmalion)\n\nAnalysis: As could be expected from a more female dominated studio, MGM does better here, winning nine Nighthawks (though most of them are before 1945). What’s more, there are an additional 39 nominees including two each from Night of the Iguana and Thelma & Louise. In its 14 year heyday (1929-42), it manages 23 nominations with six of those winning the award. The studio isn’t as solid in Drama (six wins, 30 other nominations with two films scoring two noms each) but is quite strong in Comedy (14 wins with 11 of them by 1952 as well as 22 nominees).\n\nFrom 1930 to 1944, MGM would win eight Oscars; after 1944 it would win three. But from 1930 to 1944 there would be 21 additional nominees (including three each in 1930 and 1938) while after 1944 there would be 21 more nominees including two for Thelma & Louise.\n\nOnly three MGM films have win in Drama at the Globes (Gaslight, Sweet Bird of Youth, Network) while 13 have earned noms (including two for Thelma & Louise). It would do much better in Comedy / Musical with 8 wins (most recently Moonstruck) and 20 nominees (three in the 00’s: Bandits, Legally Blonde, De-Lovely).\n\nThe only two BAFTA winners were back in the 50’s (Lili, Ask Any Girl) but there have been 20 nominees including two from Thelma & Louise. MGM has done better here than in Actor with nine of those nominations coming since the split was dropped.\n\nElisabeth Shue (Leaving Las Vegas) is the only SAG nominee. Shue won three critics awards as did Saranadon and Davis for T&L while the other 10 performances to win a critics award won just one each. Interestingly, the first six winners of the NYFC were all for MGM films: Garbo (Anna Karenina), Luise Rainer (Great Ziegfeld), Garbo again (Camille), Margaret Sullavan (Three Comrades), Leigh and Hepburn. Two of the other awards were for different performances by the same actress in one year (Jean Simmons in 1953 – The Actress / Young Bess).\n\nBest Supporting Actor:\n\nKevin Kline (A Fish Called Wanda)\n\nTom Courteney (Doctor Zhivago)\n\nCary Grant (The Philadelphia Story)\n\nBurl Ives (Cat on a Hot Tin Roof)\n\nPeter Sellers (Lolita)\n\nAnalysis: Five performances win the Nighthawk (the first four listed as well as Charles Laughton in Barretts of Wimpole Street). There are also 30 other nominees including two each from Dinner at Eight and Ryan’s Daughter and a second from Zhivago. Four films manage a genre win and another nomination, two in Drama (A Free Soul, Zhivago) and two in Comedy (Wizard of Oz, Fish Called Wanda). There are three more Drama wins and 11 more Comedy wins however there are 21 more Drama nominees and only 9 more Comedy nominees.\n\nOddly, it would take until 1942 before MGM won an Oscar (Johnny Eager) and 1956 before a second (Lust for Life). In all the studio has 8 Oscars and 21 more nominations including two for Quo Vadis.\n\nThere have been six Globe winners including Ryan’s Daughter which also had an additional nominee. Fourteen more films have earned nominations with A Dry White Season the only nominee in the category since 1975. Michael Palin (Fish) is the only BAFTA winner while there have been five other nominees. There have been no SAG nominees. Mickey Rourke (Diner) is the one person to win two critics awards while 10 other performances have earned one win each. Rather notably, only two of the critics wins (including Rourke) turned into Oscar noms: Lee J. Cobb (Brothers Karamazov) and Robert Preston (Victor/Victoria).\n\nGeorge Burns (Globe) and Kevin Kline (BAFTA) both won Oscars in the category but earned lead noms from another group.\n\nBest Supporting Actress:\n\nGloria Grahame (The Bad and the Beautiful)\n\nMargaret Hamilton (The Wizard of Oz)\n\nAngela Lansbury (Gaslight)\n\nLinda Hunt (The Year of Living Dangerously)\n\nRuth Hussey (The Philadelphia Story)\n\nAnalysis: A whopping 11 performances win the Nighthawk though only two (Night of the Iguana, Year of Living Dangerously) after 1952. Of those 11, only Greed, Wizard of Oz and Gaslight managed to win another Nighthawk award. Another 18 performances earn Nighthawk noms. There are nine Drama winners and 12 more nominees with Gone with the Wind showing up in both. In Comedy two films win the award with a second nominee (Dinner at Eight, Merrily We Live), seven films simply win the award and one film earns three nominations without a win at all (The Women). In 1938 and 1939, MGM won Comedy both times and earned six of the ten nominations.\n\nEight performances have won the Oscar with two of them (Hattie McDaniel in Gone with the Wind, Teresa Wright in Mrs. Miniver) from films that also earned another Oscar nomination. Aside from those 10, there have also been 20 more nominees including three each in 1938 and 1944. Since 1960, the studio has as many winners (VIP’s, Patch of Blue, Network, Moonstruck) as nominees (Sweet Bird of Youth, Night of the Iguana, Goodbye Girl, Victor/Victoria).\n\nThere have been six Globe winners though Olympia Dukakis is the only one since 1963. There have also been 16 nominees, the last of them in 1982 (Victor/Victoria and My Favorite Year). There have been just four BAFTA nominees (Ryan’s Daughter, Wetherby, Moonstruck, A Fish Called Wanda). Cate Blanchett (Bandits) is the only SAG nominee. Dukakis won two critics awards while seven performances have won one each though only A Sunday in the County since 1969.\n\nBest Ensemble\n\nNetwork\n\nThe Philadelphia Story\n\nGone with the Wind\n\nMrs. Miniver\n\nDoctor Zhivago\n\nAnalysis: This is based on the total points for acting for all members of the cast. Network wins this easily but it’s one of the rare films in all of film history to earn at least a 5 from six different acting performances (Finch, Holden, Dunaway, Beatty, Duvall, Straight).\n\nBest Editing:\n\n2001: A Space Odyssey\n\nThe Wizard of Oz\n\nPoint Blank\n\nThe Asphalt Jungle\n\nNorth by Northwest\n\nAnalysis: It’s worth noting that none of my Top 5 earned any nominations for their editing. Only three films win the Nighthawk (Thin Man, Wizard, 2001) while another 16 earn nominations.\n\nEight films have won the Oscar though none of them after Grand Prix in 1966. Another 27 films have earned a nomination though only three since 1967 (Network, Fame, Thelma & Louise). The best era, by far, was in the late 30’s as, even with only five nominees per year, MGM had at least two every year from 1935 to 1939. Only five films have managed a BAFTA nomination (the three late Oscar nominees plus Ryan’s Daughter and A Fish Called Wanda). Two films won ACE (How the West Was Won, Dirty Dozen) while seven others earned noms.\n\nBest Cinematography:\n\nDoctor Zhivago\n\n2001: A Space Odyssey\n\nThe Wizard of Oz\n\nGreed\n\nGone with the Wind\n\nAnalysis: By 1958, only two MGM had won the Nighthawk (Greed, Wizard) but from 1959 to 1970 four more did (North by Northwest, Zhivago, 2001, Ryan’s Daughter) and then there are no more MGM winners after 1970. Among nominations it’s quite different with 13 nominees before 1959, only four from 59 to 70 and one much later (Leaving Las Vegas).\n\nMGM won the Academy Award 17 times including five times in the 50’s but only twice after 1959, but for Lean films (Zhivago, Ryan’s Daughter). This was one of the best categories for the studio with 64 nominations aside from the wins though only three times after 1976. However, from 1943 to 1955 the studio managed 38 nominations with six of those films winning the Oscar.\n\nOnly two films managed a BAFTA win (The Hill, 2001) with only seven other nominees (only three after the British requirement was dropped). MGM never managed an ACS nomination (which didn’t start until 1986). Pennies from Heaven did win two critics awards.\n\nBest Original Score:\n\nDoctor Zhivago\n\nThe Wizard of Oz\n\nGone with the Wind\n\nPat Garrett and Billy the Kid\n\nNorth by Northwest\n\nAnalysis: There are four winners, three of which I can hum in my mind easily (Wizard, North by Northwest, Zhivago) as well as Ryan’s Daughter while there are 15 nominees including the iconic Wind score (which loses to Wizard) and the under-rated Willow score.\n\nTwelve films have won the Oscar including 8 from 1948 to 1959. Another 48 have earned nominations including 15 films from 1951 to 1957. Those numbers don’t include an Adapted Score winner (Victor/Victoria) and five more nominees. Three films won the Globe (Zhivago, Shoes of the Fisherman, Shaft) while another 7 earned nominations. Six films earned BAFTA nominations with no winners.\n\nBest Sound:\n\n2001: A Space Odyssey\n\nRonin\n\nThe Wizard of Oz\n\nDoctor Zhivago\n\nSingin’ in the Rain\n\nAnalysis: Much like Cinematography, two early winners (Wizard, They Were Expendable) and then four from 59 to 68 (Ben-Hur, Zhivago, Grand Prix, 2001) and none after that. This is a good category for nominations for MGM though with 24 of them spread out from 1930 to 1998 (Ronin).\n\nEight MGM films won Best Sound, all of them from 1930 to 1966. Another 29 films earned nominations, most recently 2010 in 1984. 2001, Fame and The Wall all won the BAFTA while Ryan’s Daughter, Network and GoldenEye earned noms. There have been no CAS nominees.\n\nBest Art Direction:\n\nThe Wizard of Oz\n\n2001: A Space Odyssey\n\nDoctor Zhivago\n\nGone with the Wind\n\nSingin’ in the Rain\n\nAnalysis: There are five Nighthawk winners but Wind and Singin are out in favor of Ben-Hur and Gaslight. There are 27 other nominees but only three after 1958 (Lolita, Far from the Madding Crowd, Victor/Victoria).\n\nWhen Zhivago won the Oscar it was the 15th MGM film to win the award in less than 40 years; it would also be the last. Still, the number is impressive as are the 52 nominations in the category including 17 in the eight year stretch from 1950 to 1957 and another 8 from 1962 to 1964. Only two of the 52 would come after 1976 (Victor/Victoria, 2010).\n\nThe only BAFTA winner is 2001 while three other films earned noms (The Hill, Ryan’s Daughter, Beatrix Potter). There have been no ADG nominees.\n\nBest Visual Effects\n\n2001: A Space Odyssey\n\nThe Wizard of Oz\n\nForbidden Planet\n\nStargate\n\nPoltergeist\n\nAnalysis: There are seven winners, spread out from 1936 to 1968 as well as 15 nominees but they cover a stretch from 1926 to 1995.\n\nEight films have won the Oscar while another 16 have earned nominations. Poltergeist is the only BAFTA winner with GoldenEye the only other nominee. With the late arrival of the VES awards, only Die Another Day and Valkyrie have earned noms and neither won.\n\nBest Sound Editing\n\n2001: A Space Odyssey\n\nRonin\n\nThe Wizard of Oz\n\nForbidden Planet\n\nWillow\n\nAnalysis: Seven films win the Nighthawk with San Francisco, Wizard, Thirty Seconds Over Tokyo, Ben-Hur and 2001 taking home both Visual Effects and Sound Editing. There are also 18 nominees but the crossover with Visual Effects is actually fairly minimal there.\n\nTwo films have won the Oscar (Grand Prix, Dirty Dozen) and two more earned noms (Poltergeist, Willow). Nine films have earned MPSE wins with another eight earning noms.\n\nBest Costume Design:\n\nThe Wizard of Oz\n\nGone with the Wind\n\nDoctor Zhivago\n\nBen Hur\n\nLust for Life\n\nAnalysis: Given how good MGM was at producing good-to-look-at Musicals, it’s surprising that the studio only manages six Nighthawks with Wizard being the only Musical (and I list it as a Kids film). The other five winners are Napoleon, A Tale of Two Cities, Gaslight, Ben-Hur and Zhivago. There are, however, another 36 nominees and 14 of those are Musicals. From 1948 to 1958, MGM doesn’t win the Nighthawk at all but earns 16 nominations with nine of those being Musicals.\n\nThough MGM’s golden era was done before the Oscars began this award in 1948, MGM still has won 10 awards and earned another 26 nominations. Six films have earned BAFTA noms, four of them British films when they still only rewarded British films in the tech categories. Four films have earned CDG noms.\n\nBest Makeup\n\nThe Wizard of Oz\n\n2001: A Space Odyssey\n\nFaust\n\nLondon After Midnight\n\nWillow\n\nAnalysis: Because my award goes back to 1926 (as opposed to the Oscar), MGM wins six awards and earns 12 more nominations.\n\nMGM won the first award in this category, a special award in 1964 for 7 Faces of Dr. Lao and would later earn one Oscar nom (2010). Three films won the MUASG (Thomas Crown Affair, both Legally Blonde films) while two others earned noms.\n\nBest Technical Aspects\n\nThe Wizard of Oz\n\n2001: A Space Odyssey\n\nDoctor Zhivago\n\nGone with the Wind\n\nBen-Hur\n\nAnalysis: Simply adding up all the points in the technical categories. These are all magnificent technical films across the board.\n\nBest Original Song:\n\n“Over the Rainbow” (The Wizard of Oz)\n\n“Knockin’ on Heaven’s Door” (Pat Garrett and Billy the Kid)\n\n“Have Yourself a Merry Little Christmas” (Meet Me in St. Louis)\n\n“We’re Off to See the Wizard” (The Wizard of Oz)\n\n“That’s Entertainment” (The Band Wagon)\n\nAnalysis: All five of these are 9 point songs. The first, of course, is the best song ever written for a film and the other four are all simply fantastic as well. MGM wins 15 Nighthawks (by far its best category) including six in the 40’s when the competition wasn’t great and only two after 1958 (“Knockin’ on Heaven’s Door”, “When the Tigers Broke Free” from Pink Floyd: The Wall). Three films win the Nighthawk and earn a second nomination (Easter Parade, Singin’ in the Rain, Jailhouse Rock) while Wizard wins and earns two other nominations. There are also 19 films that just earn nominations and for 16 of those films, it’s their only Nighthawk nom. In fact, of the 34 films that earn a Nighthawk nom (or win), 23 of them earn no other nominations while, of the 25 MGM films to earn six or more Nighthawk noms only WIzard and Singin manage a Song nom.\n\nEven though the best of MGM’s songs have mostly gone unrewarded (see how few earned Oscar noms in my Top 5), MGM has won eight Oscar and earned another 25 nominations (including Fame, the first film to ever do both). “Another Brick in the Wall” won the first BAFTA award. Yellow Rolls Royce and Fame won the Globe while 10 other films have earned nominations.\n\nBest Animated Film:\n\nThe Secret of Nimh\n\nAnalysis: It’s the only MGM Animated film to reach ***.5 and it’s, ironically, the one film officially released by MGM/UA. MGM didn’t do much with animation (I’ve seen seven feature films and as far as I know that’s all that MGM ever released). It did win the Nighthawk.\n\nBest Foreign Film:\n\nFaust\n\nNapoleon\n\nLive Flesh\n\nThe Four Days of Naples\n\nAnalysis: MGM didn’t do much distribution of foreign films and these are the only four off the list to earn ***.5 or better from me. All four of them earned Nighthawk nominations but none won the award.\n\nThe Four Days of Naples is the only film distributed in the States by MGM to ever earn an Oscar nom. A Sunday in the Country, Ginger and Fred and Live Flesh all earned BAFTA noms. A Sunday in the Country won three critics awards. Any Number Can Win won the Globe while six other films earned nominations.\n\nBest Film (by my points system):\n\nThe Wizard of Oz\n\nDoctor Zhivago\n\nSingin’ in the Rain\n\n2001: A Space Odyssey\n\nNetwork\n\nAnalysis: This just tallies up all of my points. The Wizard of Oz actually has the second most points of any film in history (behind Return of the King) with 168. It’s a long drop to Zhivago but Zhivago is still the rare film (just over 50 by 2011) to earn over 100 total points. Singin, 2001 and Network aren’t that far below.\n\nBest Film (weighted points system)\n\nThe Wizard of Oz\n\nDoctor Zhivago\n\nNetwork\n\nSingin’ in the Rain\n\nGaslight\n\nAnalysis: Wizard has the third most points ever. Network and Gaslight move up the list because of their quality of acting which are weighted higher.\n\nBest Films With No Top 5 Finishers:\n\nThe Thin Man\n\nRide the High Country\n\nBad Day at Black Rock\n\nWorst Film with a Top 5 Finish:\n\nStargate\n\nNighthawk Notables\n\nBest Film to Watch Over and Over: The Wizard of Oz\n\nBest Line (comedic): “Aristotle was not Belgian. The central message of Buddhism is not ‘every man for himself.’ And the London Underground is not a political movement. Those are all mistakes, Otto. I looked them up.” (Jamie Lee Curtis in A Fish Called Wanda)\n\nBest Line (dramatic): “Your eyes are full of hate 41. That’s good. Hate keeps a man alive.” (Jack Hawkins in Ben-Hur)\n\nWorst Line: “She’s no butterfly. Tony, she’s all pelvic thrust. I mean, she prowls. She’s got it!” (Patrick Bristow in Showgirls)\n\nBest Opening: 2001: A Space Odyssey\n\nBest Ending: Ride the High Country\n\nBest Scene: the world turns color in The Wizard of Oz\n\nBest Kiss: Vivian Leigh and Clark Gable in Gone with the Wind\n\nBest Death Scene: Margaret Hamilton in The Wizard of Oz\n\nMost Gut-Wrenching Scene: the ending of Greed\n\nMost Heart-Wrenching Scene: the end of Ride the High Country\n\nBest Use of a Song: “Over the Rainbow” (The Wizard of Oz)\n\nBest Soundtrack: The Wizard of Oz\n\nBest Rock Soundtrack: Pink Floyd: The Wall\n\nBest Original Song from a Bad Film: “Theme from Shaft“\n\nFunniest Film: A Fish Called Wanda\n\nWorst Film I Saw in the Theater: Showgirls\n\nWorst Sequel: National Lampoon’s Van Wilder: The Rise of Taj\n\nWorst Remake: Tarzan the Ape Man (1981)\n\nWorst Film by a Top 100 Director: Dream Lover (Alan J.

But MGM was dying at the point when I started going to the movies. Ironically, though, one of the first movies I ever remember seeing (Clash of the Titans) is an MGM film. It wouldn’t be until 1992 that I would see another one (The Cutting Edge). After that I count 13 films I have seen in the theater, mostly in college or Bond films (Speechless, Stargate, Blown Away, GoldenEye, Get Shorty, Leaving Las Vegas, Showgirls, Kingpin, Tomorrow Never Dies, The Man in the Iron Mask, Ronin, The World is Not Enough, Die Another Day). And, of course, I have seen The Wizard of Oz in the theater, I think four times now and the next time it plays I’ll see it again.\n\nAwards\n\nAcademy Awards\n\nNumber of Films That Have Earned Nominations: 291\n\nNumber of Films That Have Won Oscars: 99\n\nNumber of Films With Multiple Nominations: 155\n\nNumber of Films With Multiple Wins: 27\n\nBest Picture Nominations: 57\n\nTotal Number of Nominations: 741\n\nTotal Number of Wins: 168\n\nCategory With the Most Nominations: Cinematography (80)\n\nNumber of Films with Nominations I Haven’t Seen: 2\n\nDirectors with Most Oscar Nominated Films: Vincente Minnelli (16)\n\nBest Film with No Oscar Nominations: Point Blank\n\nYear with Most MGM Nominated Films: 1953 (16)\n\nYear with Most MGM Nominations: 1939 (34)\n\nOscar Oddities:\n\nMGM has the first film to 8 wins (Gone with the Wind), the first to 9 (Gigi) and the first to 11 (Ben Hur).\n\nFor over 40 years, Gigi had the most (or tied for the most) wins without a loss with 9.\n\nOf the 17 other films (aside from Gigi) with at least 7 nominations, the only one with less than two losses is Ben Hur, going 11 for 12.\n\nMGM has the film with 2nd (Gone with the Wind) and 3rd (Ben Hur) most points and is the only studio with 3 of the Top 10.\n\nThe only film with more than one nomination to win all of its nominations aside from Gigi is Grand Prix (3 for 3).\n\nWilliam Wyler made just two films for MGM but they both won Picture and Director, earned 24 combined nominations and won 17 Oscars.

The fact that he was under contract to MGM and that Selznick absolutely had to have him as Rhett Butler meant that the biggest film of all-time was distributed by MGM and made them a boatload of money. Like all the books of this kind, a good description of every one of his films, covered with two pages for every film (except GWTW which gets six).\n\nThe Films of Norma Shearer, Jack Jacobs and Myron Braum, 1976\n\nMy favorite of the MGM stars would get her own book in 1976 which isn’t bad given the rate that the books were coming out. Again, it covers all of her films but the bulk of them are MGM films. While they are covered in the history of her career at the beginning of the book, oddly, the book doesn’t list in her individual films when she earned Oscar nominations.\n\nAll the Stars in Heaven: Louis B. Mayer’s M-G-M, Gary Carey, 1981\n\nA worthwhile book that covers the first 25 years of the studio, when Mayer was in charge.\n\nThe MGM Story: The Complete History of Sixty-Five Roaring Years, John Douglas Eames, 1990\n\nOne of those great coffee table books first published in the 70’s and then often republished (with updates) through the 80’s. This one, published in 1990, covers the vast majority of MGM’s history, given that MGM scaled massively back and then went defunct in the years following its release.\n\nNorma Shearer: A Life, Gavin Lambert, 1990\n\nMost of the research, including interviews with Shearer, was done in the early 70’s but because family members were holding out hopes for writing a book, the book itself wasn’t completed and published until 1990. Either way, it’s a solid biography of one of the key MGM players, not only because Shearer was a respected (numerous Oscars noms) and powerful star but because she was married to Irving Thalberg for a decade while he was in charge of production at MGM, giving it an insight to the studio that most star biographies don’t have.\n\nMGM: When the Lion Roars, Peter Hay, 1991\n\nA very good coffee table book that looks at MGM’s history and has numerous sidebars for each year that give notable events and films. Lots and lots of stills. The downside is that the book only covers the studio’s “golden age” and ends with 1959 even though it was published in 1991.\n\nThe Golden Girls of MGM, Jane Ellen Wayne, 2002\n\nWayne likes the tawdry details (before this her books include Marilyn’s Men, Ava’s Men and Cooper’s Women) and so, while she does talk somewhat about the movies these actresses were in, it’s much more about their personal lives, especially their sex lives. After covering the main 10 actresses, she has a section called “Famous But Not So Naughty” which kind of sums up her goal.\n\nClark Gable: A Biography, Warren G. Harris, 2002\n\nA biography of possibly MGM’s biggest star, this one, while it does give details on his private life, focuses much more on his work. A fairly readable biography. I don’t know, though, if my name was Warren and my first name started H-a-r, I wouldn’t use my middle initial G and remind people of one of the worst presidents.\n\nThe Wizardry of Oz: The Artistry and Magic of the 1939 M-G-M Classic, Jay Scarfone and William Stillman, 1999 / rev. 2004\n\nA great book for any lover of The Wizard of Oz (and if you aren’t one then what the hell is wrong with you?), full of fascinating details and lots and lots of stills from the film, behind the scenes and other things related to the film.\n\nThe Leading Men of MGM, Jane Ellen Wayne, 2004\n\nWayne is back at it, because she apparently decided it wasn’t enough so she had to go into all the tawdry details of the men’s lives as well. For those who love Hollywood gossip.\n\nClark Gable: Tormented Star, David Bret, 2007\n\nAnother tell-all biography concerning a star about which there is a lot to tell.\n\nM-G-M: Hollywood’s Greatest Backlot, Steven Bingen, Stephen X. Sylvester and Michael Troyan, 2011\n\nA nice coffee table book (though presented sideways) pictorial history of MGM’s lot with a list in the back of the book that covers which movies were filmed on which parts of the lot.\n\nReviews\n\nThe Best MGM Film I Haven’t Yet Reviewed\n\nThelma & Louise (1991, dir. Ridley Scott)\n\nIt’s hard to remember what a revolutionary movie this was when it was first released. Of course, it has its roots in a film like Bonnie & Clyde, of two people together on the run with the probability that death is the only thing at the end of the road. There are several massive differences, of course, that make this, while not a film as revolutionary as that one, a story that is even more so.\n\nThelma is a bit of a ditz, a pretty woman who’s stuck in a dead-end marriage and feels the need to escape. Louise isn’t quite as trapped because while her job is boring and predictable (she’s a waitress), she’s not trapped in a marriage (she has a boyfriend) and that gives her a bit more freedom. They head out for a road trip but when they make their first stop and a guy who at first seems friendly to Thelma turns nasty and violent in the parking lot, their lives as they knew them are gone.\n\nThe easy thing to point out about this film is that the difference between Thelma and Louise and Bonnie and Clyde is that the former two don’t have to find death at the end of their road. Their story is juxtaposed against a decent cop who has been tracking them and thinks he knows what happened and might be willing to help. But they don’t feel like they can trust him, partially because they have backed themselves into a bad position (they kidnap a cop, they blow up a tanker) and partially because Louise has already been down this road before and hasn’t been believed. In the end, that’s kind of borne out when the cop is prevented from being able to talk them during the showdown. By that point, of course, Thelma and Louise have made their choice and they’re going out in a blaze of glory.\n\nRoad movies had been almost exclusively the purvey of the male-dominated film. To have two women, women who are willing to stand up for themselves, women who are willing to fight back with violence if they have to, was something new. And the fact that they go on the run in the first place is sadly not a plot hole because their fear that they would not be believed is very real and is continually borne out by circumstances almost everyday across the country. They face violence and then they are not believed.\n\nThe film has great direction from Ridley Scott, a first-rate Oscar winning script from Callie Khouri and of course fantastic performances from its two leads. One critics group split their award between both Susan Sarandon as the tougher Louisa and Geena Davis as Thelma though most of the groups, the Nighthawks included, relegated both performances to their nominee list thanks to Jodie Foster in Silence of the Lambs.\n\nOne last word about this film. In my mind, I pair it a little with Lone Star. That’s because this is the film where Brad Pitt shone through and was great in a small, limited performance (as a hitchhiker they pick up who sleeps with Thelma then steals their money) before breaking out and showing he didn’t really have the charisma to be a star (though when not trying to be a star, could be a fantastic character actor) while five years later McConaughey would do the exact same thing.\n\nThe Worst MGM Film I Haven’t Yet Reviewed\n\nHercules (1983, dir. Luigi Cozzi (billed as Lewis Coates))\n\nI will begin with a small digression. In 2005, when V and I were selling our house, we were also getting rid of some stuff. Because it was stuff well-suited to sell at a comic convention, we bought a table at the Portland convention. The cost of that table ($75 I want to say) was well worth it, because aside from making over $300 in sales, the two of us and our friend John got in the convention for free and go to see things like Lorenzo Llamas in line with a former Playboy Playmate to get food, the crazy hot agent of the author down the row from us (no one cared about the author – everyone kept trying to get looks at the agent) and a chance to see, up close, how freakishly big Lou Ferrigno is. He wasn’t that tall (well, he’s four inches taller than me but I was at a sporting event once when I saw Wilt Chamberlain and his legs went over the seat in front of him) but he was simply enormous. He was always well suited to play the Hulk on television. Also note that the Hulk didn’t require him to have lines. If you’re going to be the star of a film, you have to say lines and this film would prove that compared to Lou Ferrigno, Arnie is a Shakespearean actor.\n\nIf the piss-poor performance of Ferrigno in the lead role was the only problem with this film, it would at least be tolerable, or at least be bad more on the level of Conan the Destroyer or Red Sonja. But the key to why this film is so bad is right there on the poster. “Is he being attacked by some sort of spaceship” Veronica asked when I showed her the poster. The answer, is, yeah, kind of.\n\nSee, this film isn’t really a Hercules film. Which is astounding because if you open D’Aulaire’s Book of Greek Myths (if you don’t have a copy that is a major shortcoming you should rectify) to page 132 you will find a number of pages devoted to his deeds. Let’s remember that he did twelve magnificent labors that showed off his great strength, more than enough to fill a feature film. So, with that wealth of stories to choose from, what in the hell are the makers of this film thinking having him fight a wizard who’s trying to conquer the world through some sort of sci-fi contraption? And why give Hercules a love interest (Sybil Danning, also awful, playing Araidne, who had nothing to do with Hercules) and not have it involve the Amazons where you could bring in an entire race of warrior women and even do it while staying true to the original myths?\n\nI have a weakness for Adventure films. I have seen the Jason Mamoa Conan film more than once even though it is clearly awful. But this film is just so misconceived, so badly acted, so stupid you shouldn’t even bother with it once.\n\nBonus Review\n\nRonin (1998, dir. John Frankenheimer)\n\nI prefer the films in this category to be ones that were released when I was in high school or college and something I saw in the theater. But most of those are already reviewed (or a future review) or not very good. In the 80’s, there are a number of films I already reviewed as RCM films (Clash of the Titans, Secret of NIMH, Spaceballs, Willow). So, it was a mediocre film like The Cutting Edge or Stargate or move forward a bit in time. I can’t even get more recent than this – the only two MGM films after Ronin that I saw in the theater I have already reviewed (Bond films).\n\nJohn Frankenheimer was an interesting but very uneven director. In the 60’s with films like Birdman of Alcatraz, Manchurian Candidate, Seven Days in May, The Train and Seconds, he was one of the most sought after directors around, especially for thrillers. But after The Fixer (which was good but a bomb) he had more trouble and by the late 90’s it had been over 20 years since his last really solid film (French Connection II) and he was coming off one of the most public film disasters of the decade (The Island of Dr. Moreau). Then came this film.\n\nFirst, I wanted to see it because of the title – I have always been fascinated by samurai culture and just titling the film Ronin (I was already familiar with the story of the 47 ronin that is discussed in the film in a fascinating scene that Frankenheimer put in there because he likes miniatures – a rare example of someone taking their own fascination, putting it on film and making it really work for the story) was enough. Second, in spite of Moreau (which I saw in the theater), I have always thought of Frankenheimer more for Manchurian Candidate than anything else and so was willing to give him the benefit of the doubt. Third, it had Natascha McElhone and after The Devil’s Own and The Truman Show, I was fascinated by her. Fourth, it had Robert De Niro; in fact, it had the last Robert De Niro performance before he took his odd turn into Comedy and started making films I had no interest in. From 1991 to 1998 I saw 10 De Niro films in the theater; after that it wouldn’t be until 2012 that I would see another De Niro film in the theater.\n\nI would not be even remotely disappointed. Yes, the plot to this can be confusing if you’re not paying attention. It revolves, of course, around a great MacGuffin,this elusive briefcase that everyone is after. Except they’re not and that’s part of what makes the film great. If you haven’t seen it, I will not give it away, but the moment where your realize that one of the characters is not, in fact, after the briefcase, is the moment where everything clicks into place. To some, that made the film a waste, but to me it’s what adds an extra layer to everything we’ve already seen, a great moment that adds depth to all the flash.\n\nThere is a lot of flash. This film contains not one but two of the greatest car chases ever put on film. Even if you don’t want to reward the editing, thinking it’s too quickly cut, I can’t fathom how the Academy did not nominate the sound in this film for either of its sound awards. What this film does in those two chases, between the brilliant editing and cinematography, allowing us to know what’s going on while being continually thrilled (I’ve seen it several times on DVD but it was best watching it in the theater) and the magnificent sound is to keep the film moving at a pace that has you hanging on to the edge of your seat. That the film also has a magnificent ensemble cast (there’s also Jonathan Pryce, Jean Reno, Stellan Skarsgaard, Sean Bean) shows that the filmmakers also did right by casting it correctly. The pieces all fall into place just like they do doing each of the car chases, one through the open air and countryside surrounding and inside of Nice and another through the tunnels and highways of Paris. If you haven’t seen it, it’s a hell of a ride.\n\nPost-2011\n\nThere’s little point in doing categories down here. After the release of Hot Tub Time Machine in early 2010, MGM would stop distributing movies for most of the decade. It wouldn’t be until 2018 when they would get back into it, releasing Death Wish, Operation Finale and Creed II. In 2019, they have released Fighting with my Family but their next releases aren’t scheduled until next year (the next James Bond and Legally Blonde films). None of their films have factored into awards. Creed II did make it to #6 on their box office list though doesn’t come close to the Adjusted list. I have seen all four films though none of them factor into my awards either. Those last two releases next year will be nice because they will put the official list that I use at exactly 2000 movies which means every film I see will move it up exactly .5%."
