        "text": "Famous for its logo of a roaring lion, Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer, Inc. (MGM), ranks as one of the world’s most important film studios. MGM, based in Santa Monica, Calif., develops, produces, and distributes motion pictures for theatrical release and the home-video market as well as television programs. Founded in 1925, MGM became the world’s most prestigious and profitable studio in the 1930s and 1940s. During those years, MGM had under contract at various times such outstanding screen personalities as Greta Garbo, Lon Chaney, the Barrymores (Ethel, Lionel, and John), Joan Crawford, Jeanette MacDonald, Clark Gable, Jean Harlow, William Powell, Myrna Loy, Katharine Hepburn, Spencer Tracy, Judy Garland, Mickey Rooney, Elizabeth Taylor, Gene Kelly, and Greer Garson.\n\nFormed through a number of mergers, MGM began as the Metro Pictures Corporation, the first film-production company founded by prominent motion-picture executive Louis B. Mayer. In 1920 Marcus Loew, a film exhibitor and distributor, bought into the company, which merged with the Goldwyn Pictures Corporation four years later. In 1925 Louis B. Mayer Pictures, Mayer’s second production company, joined the group, and Mayer became the executive head of the studio, a position he kept until 1948. Under Mayer, the studio gained a reputation for producing entertaining films of consistently high quality, though they seldom dealt with controversial subjects. During its heyday, MGM produced such classic films as Grand Hotel (1932), David Copperfield (1935), The Good Earth (1937), The Women (1939), The Philadelphia Story (1940), Mrs. Miniver (1942), Gaslight (1944), and The Asphalt Jungle (1950). MGM also was associated with several famous epics, producing two versions each of Mutiny on the Bounty (1935, 1962) and Ben Hur (1925, 1959), and acting as a major financer and the sole distributor of director David O. Selznick’s blockbuster Gone With the Wind (1939). The studio produced the popular “Thin Man,” “Andy Hardy,” “Topper,” “Maisie,” “Dr. Kildare,” “Our Gang,” and “Lassie” film series. MGM became especially celebrated for its lavish musicals, including The Wizard of Oz (1939), Ziegfeld Girl (1941), Meet Me in St. Louis (1944), Till the Clouds Roll By (1946), Easter Parade (1948), On the Town (1949), Annie Get Your Gun (1950), Show Boat (1951), An American in Paris (1951), Singin’ in the Rain (1952), The Band Wagon (1953), Kiss Me Kate (1953), Silk Stockings (1957), and Gigi (1958). The studio’s later productions included Doctor Zhivago (1965), 2001: A Space Odyssey (1968), and Thelma & Louise (1991).\n\nMGM began to decline in the 1950s and underwent a series of management changes beginning in the 1960s. The company sold off many of its assets in the 1970s and for a time diversified into such nonfilm ventures as hotels and casinos. Beginning in 1973, MGM had various financial associations with another motion picture studio, United Artists Corporation. MGM merged with United Artists in 1981 to form the MGM/UA Entertainment Company, which was acquired by Turner Broadcasting System, Inc., in 1986. In 1996, Turner sold the company to an MGM management–led group. In 1997 MGM acquired the entertainment libraries of Orion Pictures and Goldwyn Entertainment. With its purchase of PolyGram Filmed Entertainment’s film library in 1999, MGM became the owner of the world’s largest film library (more than 5,000 titles), including more than half of all films produced by Hollywood studios after 1948."
