        "text": "Shelley Duvall, with her distinctive appearance and unique acting style, left an indelible mark on Hollywood. Duvall was known for her collaborations with acclaimed directors and her ability to bring complex characters to life. With her passing, let’s take a look at some of her best-known works, as well as some honorable mentions.\n\nRELATED: WWE Star The Undertaker Deems Hulk Hogan’s Sci-Fi Action Comedy ‘Suburban Commando’ The “Worst Movie Ever”\n\nThe Shining (1980)\n\nThe horror classic directed by Stanley Kubrick, the film saw Duvall play Wendy Torrance, a mother and wife who finds herself in the grips of a hotel filled with creatures from beyond.\n\nUnsurprisingly, The Shining is perhaps Shelley Duvall’s most recognized work. Who doesn’t remember the scene where Jack is taunting Wendy for the bat?\n\nIn this Kubrick classic, Duvall delivers a gripping performance opposite of Jack Nicholson, the actress contending with fear and desperation as her co-star slowly descends into madness in the isolated Overlook Hotel.\n\nPopeye (1980)\n\nThough it didn’t get much love when released, Popeye is still one of my personal favorites.\n\nPopeye is a musical comedy directed by Robert Altman. Here Duvall shines as Olive Oyl, the love interest of the titular character played by Robin Williams. Her performance captures the essence of the beloved cartoon character with remarkable precision – not to mention the look.\n\nDuvall’s Olive Oyl is both whimsical and endearing, highlighting her ability to embody a wide range of personas and bring a delightful charm to the film.\n\n3 Women (1977)\n\n3 Women is a psychological drama that allowed Duvall to explore a complex character.\n\nIn this outing, she plays Millie Lammoreaux, a chatty and naive woman whose life intertwines with those of two other women in a small desert community.\n\nSuffice to say, Duvall’s performance here is nuanced and haunting – so much so that it earned her both critical acclaim and a Best Actress Award at that years’ Cannes Film Festival.\n\nBrewster McCloud (1970)\n\nOf course, I had to add her film debut, Brewster McCloud. Duvall plays Suzanne, teaming up with Robert Altman for the first time in this offbeat comedy. The movie follows the story of a young recluse who lives in the Houston Astrodome and dreams of flying. Duvall’s quirky charm and natural screen presence set her apart.\n\nTime Bandits (1981)\n\nDirected by Terry Gilliam, Time Bandits is a fantasy adventure film in which Duvall takes on a supporting role as Dame Pansy. Though her screen time is limited, Duvall’s performance is memorable, adding a touch of whimsy to the film’s eclectic cast. Her ability to leave a lasting impression in a brief role showcases her unique talent and adaptability.\n\nHonorable Mentions\n\nRELATED: Iconic Action Star Carl Weathers Passes Away At 76 Years Old\n\nRoxanne (1987)\n\nThe first honorable mention has to be Roxanne. Not only is it another favorite of mine, it’s one of the funniest romantic comedies ever made. In the movie, Duvall plays Dixie, a charming and supportive friend to the main characters, played by Steve Martin and Daryl Hannah. Though her role is smaller, Duvall brings warmth and sincerity to the film, demonstrating her versatility in both dramatic and comedic settings. Her presence adds depth to the film’s narrative, further cementing her status as a beloved actress.\n\nSuburban Commando (1991)\n\nThe final honorable mention has to go to Suburban Commando. Not only because it has Hulk Hogan and Christopher Lloyd, I mean why not, but because as I grew up in the 90s it was one of those films I often look back on with fond memories.\n\nFor those who don’t know, the movie is a family sci-fi comedy. Duvall plays Jenny Wilcox, a suburban mom who unwittingly gets caught up in an intergalactic adventure when an alien warrior, played by Hulk Hogan, crashes into her family’s life. Duvall’s comedic timing and relatable portrayal of a bewildered but supportive wife and mother add a touch of heart to the film.\n\nShelley Duvall’s career is marked by her ability to take on diverse and challenging roles. From horror to comedy, and from leading lady to supporting character, she has consistently delivered performances that captivate and engage audiences. As an actress who has worked with some of the most visionary directors of her time, Shelley Duvall remains a fascinating figure in cinema history.\n\nNEXT: ‘Star Trek’ Actor Gary Graham Passes Away At 73 Years Old"
