        "text": "AFS Honors Robert Altman’s Texas-Made Film BREWSTER MCCLOUD\n\nMarch 10, 2020 3:03 pm Leave a Comment\n\nAt the 20th Annual Texas Film Awards this Thursday, March 12, AFS will honor Robert Altman’s 1970 film BREWSTER MCCLOUD with the Star of Texas Award. Shelley Duvall, who starred in the film, will also be inducted to the Texas Film Hall of Fame.\n\nWritten and directed by Altman (MASH, MCCABE & MRS. MILLER, THE PLAYER, SHORT CUTS), BREWSTER MCCLOUD was shot on location in and around Houston. The story centers on a strange boy (Bud Cort) living in the Houston Astrodome who spends his days crafting a pair of wings, when his plans are derailed by a serial killer, a beautiful girl (Shelley Duvall), and a detective trying to get to the bottom of it all (Michael Murphy).\n\nOn Wednesday, March 11, AFS will host a sold out special screening of BREWSTER MCCLOUD with Duvall in attendance at the AFS Cinema.\n\nTo celebrate this honor and the 50th anniversary of the film, we’re sharing a selection of behind-the-scene photos from the film and quotes from Robert Altman.\n\n“The Astrodome was new then and it was an indoor area that size that nobody had experienced. Somebody somewhere said something about it and that fascinated me. I went down to look at it and I said “Great.” It was quite an accomplishment just to be able to do it. I think how else can you show that this guy flies unless he’s trapped. He’s like in a cage so that became his freedom. He wasn’t free.” –Altman\n\n“I was making Brewster McCloud in Houston, Texas. I had a small part in the film, and I wanted very much to have not an actress but a local girl who had the accents, who was awkward…I just wanted somebody from that area. And we found Shelley down there, and she was quite remarkable—and put her in the film—she served the purpose of that film very well. And Shelley just developed to the state where she is now. I mean, she’s peerless.“ –Altman\n\n“I think that the things that were imitative in Brewster McCloud were imitative from other mediums—it might be pretentious in other ways- it was cartoon and road runners—but that’s what it was intended to be. Everyone worked in different levels of comedy and I like it.” –Altman\n\n“A film like Brewster McCloud can’t be related to anything…That’s what a lot of the critics said…”– Altman\n\n“It’s probably the most creative, most original film that I’ve done… I was cockiest at that point and I stretched the furthest.” – Altman\n\n“You always hope you’ll be adored. Brewster was much more of a critical success than MASH was…I really like most of my films, but I think you tend to love your most unsuccessful children the most.”– Altman\n\nREAD THIS: Beautifully Harrowing: Why You Must Bear Witness to “COME & SEE”\n\nFebruary 25, 2020 3:38 pm Leave a Comment\n\nCOME & SEE is considered the most devastating anti-war film ever made. Released in the later years of the artistically liberating time of Glasnost, Soviet Union director Elem Klimov tells the story of a Belarusian village being invaded by Hitler’s German troops in 1943. Young Flyora decides to join the Soviet army to defend his village with dreams of heroism and glamor. Instead, Flyora witnesses the intense cruelty and carnage of war as he invariably loses his innocence and comes to grips with the harshness of life.\n\nIn anticipation of our upcoming presentation of the newly restored COME & SEE, we invite you to read the critical reactions to the film and explore its lasting legacy. Screenings begin this Saturday, March 7, 4PM, at the AFS Cinema. Full schedule is here.\n\nRoger Ebert: “It’s said that you can’t make an effective anti-war film because war by its nature is exciting, and the end of the film belongs to the survivors. No one would ever make the mistake of saying that about Elem Klimov’s “Come and See.” It’s not everyday that you get this vote of confidence from Roger Ebert. Read more >>\n\nThe AV Club\n\n“Come and See paints a real historical event as an expressionist nightmare, full of abstract horrors and heightened surrealism.” AV Club’s review whole heartedly recommends this film for a bone-chilling time at the cinema. Read more >>\n\nThe New York Times:\n\n“Powerful material, powerfully rendered by the director and co-writer Elem Klimov…” “Scene for scene, Mr. Klimov proves a master of a sort of unreal realism that seeks to get at events terrible beyond comprehension.” The New York Times knew COME & SEE was more than just a film. It was the beginning of the end for the Iron Curtain. Read more >>\n\nThe Calvert Journal on COME & SEE’s Legacy\n\n“In the 30 years since Come and See‘s release, although its influence has been great, none of the more recent films have been able to realise the original’s emotional acuity.” Calvert Journal tells the readers how it is: there will never be another COME & SEE. Read the full article >>\n\nELEM KLIMOV ON MAKING “COME & SEE”\n\n(https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VN9_r1NEnGM)\n\nCOME & SEE director Elem Klimov recounts the nightmarish process of getting his film through the Soviet censors, and more.\n\nRichard Linklater’s BEFORE SUNRISE at 25\n\nFebruary 14, 2020 5:04 pm Leave a Comment\n\nAFS Public Relations Senior intern, Tom Richard Santos, shares his thoughts on BEFORE SUNRISE ahead of the screening this weekend—the entire Before Trilogy screens Sunday, February 16 at AFS Cinema.\n\nThis year, BEFORE SUNRISE (1995) celebrates a full twenty-five years since Jesse and Celine met on that fateful train passing through Vienna. To celebrate, AFS will be showing this classic love story, written and directed by AFS Founder and Artistic Director Richard Linklater—along with the two following films in the trilogy BEFORE SUNSET and BEFORE MIDNIGHT—this Valentine’s Day weekend.\n\nFrom its relatively quiet beginning in the 90’s indie film wave, SUNRISE has become timeless for many. However, it has also grown more timely for others as the years go on, and perhaps that’s the best reason to revisit it this weekend—and why it’s an absolute must-watch for first-timers.\n\n“Why this movie?,” you might ask. Why has it remained one of the most enduring love stories of the last quarter centuries? Is it the romance? The story? The will-they, won’t-they over one magical night in Vienna?\n\nThere’s likely no one reason. But, in honor of its anniversary, one reason stands out when looking back—it endures because it’s one of the few films of its genre and time that engages in discussion with not only itself and its characters, but also with the person watching it.\n\nIn short? It’s a film about talking that also wants to talk with you.\n\nMore than a romance, more than early mumblecore, more than “a film about nothing”, SUNRISE as a film seems to strive for one-on-one connections with those watching as much as it does with Celine and Jesse—through a constant back-and-forth on a range of subjects. Whether it’s love or loss, religion or philosophy, or cynicism and romance, the film offers a multitude of things to talk about—and is willing to bet you have something to say about it too.\n\nAnd like any good conversationalist, SUNRISE leaves room for the viewer to talk as well, primarily by asking questions of the viewer throughout. For example, in the first café scene, the film seems to ask how you feel about the palm-reader. Do you agree it’s largely a con, like Jesse? Or do you see it as a romantic, slightly magical encounter as Celine does? Or are you stuck in the middle somewhere, torn when the two argue about it before being interrupted on the Danube?\n\nThese scenes structure the film much like a coffee klatsch, jumping from topic to topic, like old friends catching up as they pass the cream and sugar. It’s wonderfully organic, and makes a viewer feel like they’re there at that table. Perhaps that’s because, in a way, they are.\n\nYet the film rarely answers those questions itself—though Jesse and Celine certainly have their opinions. Instead, SUNRISE film puts the onus of those answers on the viewer. And that’s a rare thing. Many films simply cannot wait to tell you what they’re about, and how you should feel about it. Didacticism rules their messages, and maybe that in itself is evocative of our world today. We are commanded daily by the society we’ve built to have strong opinions and concrete beliefs in just about everything, and both nuance and ambiguity are often sacrificed in the process.\n\nPerhaps that’s where some of the magic of SUNRISE lies, in its opposition to those ideas. Every opinion and paradigm in the film is continually challenged and collided with throughout the narrative. What’s left from that collision, at least for some, is something much more amorphous and gray. And you are encouraged to make of it what you will.\n\nOr perhaps not. You are also welcome to take the film at face value. But then again, you are also welcome to change your mind. In the twenty-five years since its release, SUNRISE has invited viewers year after year to return and have that same conversation, again and again. To ask those same questions of themselves. To change their minds.\n\nIt’s almost a litmus test of growth, and of who you have become since your last viewing. How do you feel about the palm-reader this time? Why does that matter?\n\nWho are you now?\n\nThat’s one of the many reasons why the film remains so evergreen and why it’s important to so many. You can enjoy it along with the rest of the BEFORE TRILOGY, or as a single show, this weekend at AFS Cinema. Tickets are available here.\n\nUntil then? “Bye”, “Goodbye”, “Au Revoir” and “Later”.\n\nJohn Cameron Mitchell Brings His Musical Podcast Anthem: Homunculus To AFS Jan 19\n\nJanuary 14, 2020 5:02 pm Leave a Comment\n\nThis Sunday, January 19, the AFS Cinema welcomes acclaimed writer/director/performer John Cameron Mitchell (HEDWIG AND THE ANGRY INCH, VINYL, RABBIT HOLE) for a marathon listening party of the first season of his musical podcast, ANTHEM: HOMUNCULUS. The podcast follows a man named Ceann who is crowdfunding for a life-saving brain surgery by telling his life’s story in a livestream telethon from his Kansas trailer-park home.\n\nANTHEM is a beautiful, sorrowful, and mesmerizing piece of art, due in no small part to the excellent score by composer Bryan Weller (who will also be in attendance), and an all-star cast that includes Glenn Close, Patti LuPone, Cynthia Erivo, and more. It is also deeply evocative of Mitchell’s storied history as a playwright and stage performer.\n\nThe show starts at 2PM and we’ll be listening to all ten episodes in season one mixed with music and conversation, so plan to stay late (until 9PM)! In anticipation, AFS spoke to Mitchell about ANTHEM: HOMUNCULUS and what to expect at the listening party on January 19. Here’s what he had to say:\n\nWHERE DID THE IDEA OF MAKING A MUSICAL PODCAST COME FROM, AND HOW DID YOU COME UP WITH THE NAME?\n\nI first wrote it as “Hedwig and the Divine Homunculus,” a sequel to “Hedwig and the Angry Inch.” But the autobiographical elements were just too incompatible with Hedwig’s so I removed her from the story like a benign tumor. Then I fashioned it into a kind of alternate autobiography: what would I be like if I never left my small town? My co-creator Bryan Weller and I began writing it as a TV series at William S. Burroughs’ Lawrence, KS house – we were invited by his longtime partner, James Grauerholtz. Hollywood wasn’t impressed with the project so we rethought it as a podcast series, perhaps the most expensive one ever made as it’s dense with 40 actors, 31 songs, full orchestra, boys’ choirs and complex soundscapes. It was financed by Topic Studios and is distributed by Luminary Podcast Network. Anthem is the name of our overarching musical anthology series – each season will be a different musical made by different creators. Our season is called Homunculus which means “little man” and refers to the tiny alchemist-created Frankenstein in Faust. It’s also the name of the kind of tumor that my character suffers from. My little man turns out to be sentient.\n\nTHE PODCAST FEATURES 31 ORIGINAL SONGS BY YOU AND BRYAN WELLER. WHERE DID YOU GET THE INSPIRATION FROM, DID THE STORY INFORM THE SONGS OR VICE-VERSA?\n\nThe story came first. I left holes for songs. Bryan encouraged me to write the lyrics for the songs and he would provide a musical setting and suggest melody. I would refine the melody and lyrics and we worked very quickly.\n\nYOU HAVE AN AMAZING CAST IN THE PODCAST INCLUDING GLENN CLOSE, PATTI LUPONE, CYNTHIA ERVO, LAURIE ANDERSON—HOW DID THEY BECOME INVOLVED IN THE PROJECT?\n\nThey were all folks that I knew in some capacity so it was easy to reach out. Good actors are always up for a new challenge especially when they don’t have to shave (podcasts are easy to act in). I sought out Cynthia after seeing her unbelievable performance in The Color Purple on Broadway (see her current Oscar-nominated turn as Harriet Tubman) but Nakhane was the hardest to find. I heard about him in the South African film The Wound and ended up connecting by Instagram (he had just finished watching my film SHORTBUS). We flew him in from Johannesburg. He’s a truly brilliant musical and acting powerhouse.\n\nARE THERE ANY PLANS FOR A SECOND SEASON? IF SO, WHAT CAN YOU TELL US ABOUT IT?\n\nWe are presently seeking pitches for season 2. Reach out through DM to our IG @anthempod or mine @johncameronmitchell. Anything goes as long as you might see it as a musical series.\n\nWHAT CAN THE AUSTIN AUDIENCE EXPECT AT THE JAN 19 EVENT AT THE AFS CINEMA?\n\nIt’ll be like a 7 hour daytime sleepover in a cinema. Cozy seating, food, drink, abstract visuals, surround-sound mix, a few live songs from me and Bryan. Come on down! I’ll also be doing a concert at Bass Hall on February 7 called The Origin of Love: The Songs and Stories of Hedwig.\n\nAFS’ Lars Nilsen’s Top Picks from the 2019 Toronto International Film Fest\n\nOctober 4, 2019 7:10 pm Leave a Comment\n\nThe Toronto International Film Festival is one of the first and best places to discover important new films—from awards season contenders to independent gems. For AFS Lead Programmer Lars Nilsen, it’s a great opportunity to explore many of these new films and scout out titles that may someday make it to the AFS Cinema. After 10 days and over 30+ films, he shares some of his top picks from this year’s festival:\n\nCOLLECTIVE\n\ndir. Alexander Nanau\n\nThis is a documentary about pervasive corruption in the Romanian health care industry. Sounds exciting right? In fact, it is. Starting with a major nightclub fire and its tragic aftermath in which a failed health care response resulted in many unnecessary fatalities, this film follows the trail of crooked hospital administrators and political appointees into some fairly wild corners. I won’t spoil the film, but it is part newsroom suspense drama and part gangster movie and you will be riveted by it.\n\nTHE LOST OKOROSHI\n\ndir. Abba Makama\n\nFrom Nigeria comes this very strange but at times poignant fantasy about a rural man who works in a Lagos skyscraper as a security guard and despairs over the loss of community and traditions in the fast paced, modern city. Suddenly one night he undergoes a Kafka-esque metamorphosis into a colorful grass-skirted ancestral spirit called an Okoroshi. This odd situation is accepted by all at face value, and soon the Okoroshi is engaging in fish-out-of-water adventures among disbelieving city-folk. Some really big laughs here alongside the social commentary. Also, a level of deep weirdness that keeps the whole enterprise popping.\n\nPORTRAIT OF A LADY ON FIRE\n\ndir. Céline Sciamma\n\nThis new film from Céline Sciamma (GIRLHOOD) is a gothic 18th century period piece about a female artist who is commissioned to paint a portrait of noblewoman’s daughter in order to entice a potential husband for the young woman. The daughter refuses to sit for a portrait, so the artist must stealthily observe her and paint her from memory at night. You might guess some of what happens next. In the context of this story, the film makes some really timely points about female representation. The symbolism is “louder” here than is fashionable in most contemporary films. You probably won’t miss Sciamma’s point. I am a big fan of boldness in symbolic language, so, unsurprisingly, I loved this film. I also appreciate that it honors the gothic tradition in literature by hewing faithfully to the style without spoofing it.\n\nTHE TRUTH\n\ndir. Hirokazu Kore-eda\n\nHirokazu Kore-eda’s followup to the breakout hit SHOPLIFTERS is something radically different. Made in France and in French, it stars Catherine Deneuve as a great screen star who is a demanding diva in her family life and on the set as she plays a small role in a new film alongside a very popular young actress. Juliette Binoche plays Deneuve’s screenwriter daughter, and Ethan Hawke plays Binoche’s B-list actor husband. The film is a chamber piece, with everyone lending support to one dazzling soloist – Deneuve, in a part that was surely written for her because no one else could conceivably play it.\n\nTHE TWENTIETH CENTURY\n\ndir. Matthew Rankin\n\nRaise your hand if you know virtually nothing about Canadian Prime Ministers of the past. I thought so. I am also in the dark here. This film is a deeply strange, perverse biopic depicting the life and times of the Prime Minister I am told was the greatest leader in Canadian history, Mackenzie King. As recounted by filmmaker Matthew Rankin, King’s life was a non-stop parade of humiliation, sexual and otherwise. This apparently low-budget film is full to the brim with a commodity most other movies can’t buy, even with all the money in Hollywood – innovation and obsessive creativity. It’s also very, very funny.\n\nAustin Film Society Staff Pick Their Favorite Summer Films from the AFS Cinema\n\nSeptember 10, 2019 9:27 pm Leave a Comment\n\nIt’s been a great summer for film at the AFS Cinema. Here is a roundup of favorites chosen by Austin Film Society team members that surprised, delighted, and inspired us over the past couple of months.\n\nGabe Chicoine, Marketing Associate\n\nINGRID\n\n“Morrissa Maltz’s INGRID was an unexpectedly moving experience for me. In its brief 55 minute runtime the film beautifully captures the life of a German immigrant and outsider artist who left the American Dream behind to follow her own path, living off the grid in self-imposed solitude in rural Arkansas.”\n\nBrady Dyer, Communications Manager\n\nPARIS IS BURNING\n\n“I had heard a lot about the documentary PARIS IS BURNING, but never had a chance to see it. I’m so glad I waited until the opportunity this summer to see it on the big screen. It captures Ball life and the bourgeoning Vogue scene in NYC in the 1980s, before pop culture grabbed a hold of it. At the time of the documentary, the scene was still relatively underground and the key figures—like Willi Ninja and Venus Xtravaganza—were trying to make a name for themselves, hoping to one day break out. The film beautifully presents an intimate portrait of those involved in the scene—their stories are poignant and touching, mixed with joy and disappointment. Although filmed in the ‘80s PARIS feels fresh, honest, timely, and incredibly relevant. Everybody wants a place to belong.”\n\nFabien Ferrari, Summer Intern\n\nGHOST IN THE SHELL\n\n“I discovered GHOST IN THE SHELL for the first time on the small screen. But seeing it in a theater, thanks to AFS, it was truly another experience. I felt transported into this dystopian world that inspired so many Science Fiction movies. I can’t tell how moving it was to see these wonderful old school drawings shots of the futuristic city on a big screen, along with the incredible theme song as loud as it can be. It allowed me to be involved as ever in the story and understand the meaning more behind this powerful anime.”\n\nYolanda Gamble, Youth Media Specialist\n\nTHE FAREWELL\n\n“My pick is THE FAREWELL. I had the chance to attend the sneak preview with Director Lulu Wang, where she shared her inspiration for the film. I love how AFS has a pulse on groundbreaking filmmakers who are bringing their unique perspective onto the big screen while telling a story that is universal to so many people. It definitely made me want to visit my grandma more often!”\n\nEllie Kotapish, Development Manager\n\nTHE FAREWELL\n\n“My summer film pick is THE FAREWELL. I got to see this at our member sneak preview screening where the director Lulu Wang was present to do a Q&A. The story is fascinating overall, but I really appreciated the story and characters. It was refreshing, funny, and relatable (oddly enough). I highly recommend this film!\n\nJake Martinez, Summer Intern\n\nONCE UPON A TIME IN THE WEST\n\n“ONCE UPON A TIME IN THE WEST has stuck with me for weeks. Seeing it at the cinema was amazing—I was transported, by Leone and Morricone, into a world that seemed to be just on the other side of the screen, with an operatic symphony in the walls. I’m really glad there’s a theatre in town playing these films, like they’re meant to be seen.”\n\nConner Smith, Development Coordinator\n\nHOUSE OF HUMMINGBIRD\n\n“The film HOUSE OF HUMMINGBIRD, which was part of the Austin Asian American Film Festival’s excellent lineup, is one of my favorite films that I’ve seen this year. It’s a devastating and beautiful coming-of-age story that presents an authentic narrative about what it feels like to be a teenager. And I appreciate how the ending didn’t tie up into a perfect bow.”\n\nClaudia Silva, Senior Marketing Intern\n\nCAPERNAUM\n\n“After watching CAPERNAUM from director Nadine Labaki, I left the cinema determined to change my life, that’s how inspired I was with twelve-year old Zain’s journey. In the film, Zain wants to sue his own parents for not getting him a birthday certificate in Lebanon, which lacked him the rights of a citizen, including public health care and attending the local public school. The movie is a piece of art that reminds us we are capable to face all the challenges and adversities to achieve our goals, if we have the guts, right attitudes, and determination to change our own history.”"
