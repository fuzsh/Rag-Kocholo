        "text": "Orphaned as a child, Samuel trained as a glovemaker in Hamburg, Germany, and then traveled to England, where he was known as Samuel Goldfish. In 1898, he emigrated to Gloversville, New York, USA, and returned to the glove industry, sweeping floors in a factory. Working his way up, and with a talent for sales and marketing, Samuel became a successful glove salesman for the Elite Glove Company.\n\nIn 1913, Samuel partnered with his brother-in-law, vaudeville producer Jesse Lasky, to create the Jesse Lasky Feature Play Company. That year, they produced Hollywood’s first feature-length film with a then-unknown director by the name of Cecil B. DeMille, called The Squaw Man. Three years later, they merged with Adolph Zukor’s Famous Players Film Company to become the Famous Players–Lasky company, with Samuel serving as chairman of the board.\n\nSamuel decided to go his own way in 1917. He formed the Goldwyn Pictures Company in partnership with Broadway producers Edgar and Archibald Selwyn. The company created the famous “Leo the Lion” trademark, which is still used by Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer (MGM) today."
