        "text": "The manuscript series of the Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer Wardrobe Department records span the years 1940-1984 (bulk 1950s and 1960s) and encompass 20 linear feet. The collection consists primarily of papers and photographs in the form of wardrobe plotbooks. Other items include various materials on technical aspects of concern to wardrobe personnel, correspondence, and a host of miscellaneous articles. In some cases, only one of these elements is represented in the records of a given film, but often elements are combined to reveal a more complete account of the workings of the Wardrobe Department. Films represented encompass 44 years and range from THE PHILADELPHIA STORY (1940) to RECKLESS (1984). MGM releases account for all but eight of the 255 films represented, including two apparently made-for-television movies. The non-MGM films are ANGEL, ANGEL, DOWN WE GO (1969), THE EGYPTIAN (1954), 80 STEPS TO JONAH (1969), THE GALLANT HOURS (1960), THE GOODBYE GIRL (1977), HANG 'EM HIGH (1968), MR. MOM (1983), and THE TEN COMMANDMENTS (1956).\n\nThe Wardrobe Department elements appear in a variety of formats, with the most important and most common being the wardrobe plotbooks (also known as wardrobe breakdowns, costume plotbooks, and costume breakdowns). These follow various styles but usually consist of continuities or scripts into which wardrobe reference photos (also known as costume test stills) have been placed to correspond to the scenes in which these costumes appear, often accompanied by notations and swatches of fabric used in the actual costumes. In many instances there are separate plotbooks for men and women. Photographic material may be separate or included in the plotbooks. Whether black and white or color, they take a multiplicity of forms: wardrobe reference photos, production stills, photographs from contact sheets, photos of the designer's drawings, negatives, transparencies, and film frames. Their sizes are diverse, ranging from a single frame of 35-millimeter film to 8x10-inch stills. The most common are 5x6-inch photos of actors wearing the costumes. There are numerous lists of measurements and wardrobe changes as well as an occasional stray costume tag. Information on a location shoot was sometimes accompanied by shipping invoices for costumes and jewelry, and research information on various types of costuming appeared sporadically throughout. Wardrobe personnel had to be kept apprised of any changes in scripts or characters that occurred in the pre-production stages as well as during the actual filming. As a result, assorted drafts of a script would often accompany the other materials. In addition, cast, bit, and crew lists were constantly updated, and revisions of shooting and other production schedules were standard. Memoranda, letters, and telegrams all served to amend previous decisions, request or supply information, and notify staff members of pertinent changes prior to and during a production. While the memos were related mostly to interoffice dealings, the letters in particular were concerned with extradepartmental affairs. Several dozen costume design drawings, many unidentified, are present. Notable are several by Helen Rose ranging from THE SWAN (1956) to MADE IN PARIS (1966); one by Walter Plunkett for THE PLYMOUTH ADVENTURE (1952); four by Donfeld for WHO'LL STOP THE RAIN (1978); and one by Yvonne Wood.\n\nItems of special interest include a swatch from one of Ben-Hur's costumes from the 1959 movie of the same name. The fabric is attached to a sheet that describes a detailed method by which the material can be made to look old and worn. BEN-HUR and HOME FROM THE HILL (1960) provide examples of original watercolor costume drawings, another type of article appearing infrequently in the collection."
