For other uses, see MGM (disambiguation).\n\n\"MGM Distribution Co.\" redirects here. Not to be confused with MGM Distribution.\n\nMetro-Goldwyn-Mayer Studios Inc. (also known as Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer Pictures, commonly shortened to MGM),[1] is an American media company specializing in film and television production and distribution based in Beverly Hills, California.[2] MGM was founded on April 17, 1924 and has been owned by the Amazon MGM Studios subsidiary of Amazon since 2022.\n\nQuick Facts Trade name, Company type ...\n\nClose\n\nMetro-Goldwyn-Mayer was formed by Marcus Loew by combining Metro Pictures, Goldwyn Pictures and Louis B. Mayer Pictures into one company.[3][4] It hired a number of well-known actors as contract players—its slogan was \"more stars than there are in heaven\"—and soon became Hollywood's most prestigious filmmaking company, producing popular musical films and winning many Academy Awards. MGM also owned film studios, movie lots, movie theaters and technical production facilities. Its most prosperous era, from 1926 to 1959, was bracketed by two productions of Ben Hur. It divested itself of the Loews movie theater chain and, in 1956, expanded into television production.\n\nIn 1969, businessman and investor Kirk Kerkorian bought 40% of MGM and dramatically changed the operation and direction of the studio.[5] He hired new management, reduced the studio's output to about five films per year, and diversified its products, creating MGM Resorts International as a Las Vegas–based hotel and casino company (which it later divested in the 1980s). In 1980, the studio acquired United Artists. In 1986, Kerkorian sold MGM to Ted Turner, who retained the rights to the MGM film library, sold the studio lot in Culver City to Lorimar, and sold the remnants of MGM back to Kerkorian a few months later. After Kerkorian sold and reacquired the company again in the 1990s, he expanded MGM by purchasing Orion Pictures and the Samuel Goldwyn Company, including both of their film libraries. Finally, in 2004, Kerkorian sold MGM to a consortium that included Sony Pictures."
