        "text": "To fully enjoy a stay in Paris, without missing any of the must-see attractions, the first thing to do is to organize a sightseeing itinerary. Of course, the Eiffel Tower tops the list of historical monuments to discover. So, so as not to waste time on transport, we have listed for you all the essential sites to visit around the Eiffel Tower .\n\nAt the foot of the Eiffel Tower\n\nAfter discovering the Iron Lady and admiring the view from its summit, you just need to walk a few minutes to access other emblematic places in the capital.\n\nThe Champ-de-Mars park\n\nSpread over more than 24 hectares, the Champ-de-Mars park is undoubtedly the most photographed green space in Paris. It must be said that it offers a breathtaking view of the Eiffel Tower, and it represents an ideal spot for a pleasant walk. The vast lawns and large paths are regularly occupied by tourists looking for fresh air, but also by joggers or families who come to picnic. Between the Seine and the École Militaire, the Champ-de-Mars park is also an emblematic place for many popular gatherings, such as the fireworks on July 14, or the Olympic sporting events.\n\nThe Grand Ephemeral Palace\n\nAt the end of the Champs-de-Mars park is the Grand Palais Éphémère . Temporarily installed opposite the work of Gustave Eiffel, this 10,000 m² temporary exhibition hall hosts all events at the Grand Palais until its reopening, whether artistic, sporting or cultural. Its eco-design and wooden frame also make it an innovative masterpiece of French architecture.\n\nThe Grand Palais Éphémère will be completely dismantled in 2024, and each material will be reused. We also offered you our retrospective of the superb Paris Photo event .\n\nCruise ships on the Seine\n\nBoarding a Bateau-Mouche and sailing on the Seine is probably one of the most typical tourist attractions in Paris. This is the opportunity to discover the capital and its historical monuments from another angle, and to live a unique and charming experience. For an hour, the boat takes you to meet the most emblematic sites, while a guide tells you the history of Paris.\n\nThe Quai Branly Museum - Jacques Chirac\n\nAt the foot of the Eiffel Tower, on the banks of the Seine, the Quai Branly Museum is recognizable by its bold glass architecture, designed by Jean Nouvel. Around, the green wall and the lush garden also attract the eye and are a real invitation to take a walk.\n\nInside, the Parisian museum traces more than 100 centuries of history through 370,000 works from the four corners of the world, of which more than 3,500 years are on display. We discover civilizations and arts from Africa, Oceania, Asia, and the Americas, represented by various objects: jewelry, clothing, musical instruments, sculptures, photographs...\n\nThe Paris Sewer Museum\n\nNear the Alma bridge and the Quai Branly museum, the Paris sewer museum offers an atypical visit to discover the capital's sewers. Renovated in 2021, this exhibition space offers an immersive experience in the sanitation network of the City of Paris.\n\nSites within a 20-minute walk of the Eiffel Tower\n\nYour curiosity can take you a little further than the Eiffel Tower district , without taking you far from the 7th arrondissement of Paris and the Hôtel Bleu de Grenelle. Here are some good addresses less than 20 minutes walk from the Iron Lady.\n\nThe Paris Museum of Modern Art and the Palais de Tokyo\n\nOn the banks of the Seine, a building dating from 1937 stands out, erected for the Universal Exhibition. In the west wing, we find the Palais de Tokyo , entirely dedicated to contemporary art . With an exhibition space of 22,000 m², it is to date the largest contemporary art center in Europe. There are temporary exhibitions highlighting artists from design, music and fashion.\n\nIn the east wing, we find the Museum of Modern Art (MAM) , entirely devoted to the different artistic movements from the 20th century until today. Its Art Deco architecture is a masterpiece in itself, but above all it houses great works by renowned artists, such as Picasso, Matisse, Modigliani, Alberto Giacometti and Chagall.\n\nThe Yves Saint Laurent Paris museum and the Galliera palace\n\nJust behind the Palais de Tokyo and the Museum of Modern Art, we find two tourist sites in Paris: the Yves Saint Laurent museum and the Palais Galliera . 200 meters from each other, they are two of the 3 Parisian museums dedicated to fashion.\n\nInstalled in the fashion house occupied for a long time by the famous couturier , the Yves Saint Laurent museum is made up of the salons which hosted, at the time, the designer's major fashion shows. There, in the form of permanent and temporary exhibitions, you will find the designer's collections of accessories, dresses, videos and photos.\n\nA little further, the Palais Galliera, Fashion Museum of the City of Paris , traces the history of clothing and fashion in France, from the 18th century to today, through costumes, accessories and documents graphic arts.\n\nThe National Museum of Asian Arts - Musée Guimet\n\nNear the Palais Galliera, towards the Trocadéro, the Guimet museum is dedicated to Asian arts . From China to Korea, from Afghanistan to Japan, more than 5,000 years of history are traced through various forms of artistic expression: jewelry, textiles, statues, ceramics, prints, armor, paintings...\n\nThe Trocadéro, its esplanade and its gardens\n\nFrom the Eiffel Tower, cross the Pont d'Iéna to reach the Trocadéro . Here, you will undoubtedly find the most beautiful balcony with a view of the Iron Lady, the Seine and the entire Left Bank. Tourists make an essential stopover there to enjoy a breathtaking view of the capital, but also to enjoy the Trocadéro gardens , with its Warsaw fountain and its 20 water cannons. Day and night, in summer and winter, the Troca, as Parisians like to call it, is a vast expanse of 90,000 m² ideal for strolling and marveling.\n\nThe Museum of Man\n\nBehind the Trocadéro esplanade , you will discover a building housing several Parisian cultural places, including the Musée de l'Homme . Here, its creator, Paul Rivet, wanted to retrace the history and future of Man through an original and rich visit. Human hope is then detailed based on anthropological, prehistoric and ethnographic collections.\n\nWithin the museum, the route guides you in 3 stages: “Who are we?”, “Where do we come from?” and “Where are we going?”.\n\nThe Paris Aquarium\n\nIf you have time on your hands and you like the aquatic world, take advantage of being in the Trocadéro garden to go to the Paris Aquarium . Inaugurated in 1867 for the Universal Exhibition, it is the oldest aquarium in the world, but it continues to amaze young and old. There, more than 13,000 fish and invertebrates live, including 50 sharks and 700 coral colonies. But the most impressive thing is probably the 15 pools in which there are more than 2,500 jellyfish. This installation is also recognized as being the largest medusarium in Europe .\n\nIn the shadow of the Eiffel Tower, this Parisian aquarium offers numerous educational activities to discover the biotopes of the French coasts.\n\nThe city of architecture and heritage\n\nStill at the Trocadéro, near the Palais de Chaillot, is the city of architecture and heritage . Open to the public since 2007, this building is above all a commercial and industrial site, but it also offers an architecture center, a museum, a school and a specialized library. The objective of this national public establishment is to raise awareness of the heritage and architecture of our territory.\n\nThe wine museum\n\nLeaving the Trocadéro, head towards the Bir-Hakeim bridge to reach the wine museum . It's not really in the 16th arrondissement of Paris that you'd expect to find a museum dealing with oenology. However, it is in vaulted cellars dating from the 15th century that the wine museum is located. There we find history, traditions, heritage and French wine-making know-how through a collection of 2,000 objects. The unusual museum also offers wine tasting workshops and a restaurant.\n\nFind our selection of museums just a stone's throw from our hotel!\n\nThe best spots to admire the Eiffel Tower\n\nOn the square in front of the Eiffel Tower, the Iron Lady stands out with presence. But when we step back and admire it from afar, it takes on an air of great elegance. If you are captivated by the beauty of this architectural masterpiece, here are some favorite spots to admire the Eiffel Tower .\n\nFrom the Seine, on a barge or cruise ship\n\nMany companies offer a stroll or dinner on the Seine . And for good reason, Parisian boats run along the Seine, weaving between the greatest monuments in Paris. But it is above all the Eiffel Tower that attracts all the curiosities. While sailing on the waves, day and night, the Iron Lady reveals herself in her most beautiful light.\n\nFrom the 56th floor of the Montparnasse tower\n\nGet up high to admire the Eiffel Tower from another angle, by climbing to the top floor of the Montparnasse Tower . This tower is the second tallest in Paris, and offers a breathtaking panorama of the first tallest tower! From the Ciel de Paris restaurant, the Eiffel Tower has never been so beautiful.\n\nFrom the Les Ombres restaurant, at the Quai Branly museum\n\nOn the roof terrace of the Musée du Quai Branly , you can have lunch or dinner at the Les Ombres restaurant, and enjoy an intimate face-to-face encounter with the Eiffel Tower. If you're short on time, a little hot drink at Café Branly will do the trick and delight you.\n\nFrom the Paris Ferris Wheel\n\nNear the Louvre Museum, the Grande Roue de la Concorde is another ideal spot to admire the Eiffel Tower. If you are lucky enough to have it in place during your stay in Paris, take the time to climb aboard a basket which will take you 60 meters high, in a timeless romantic atmosphere.\n\nFrom the Sacré-Coeur of Montmartre\n\nUltimately, it's from above that you can best see the Eiffel Tower, so climb to the top of the Butte Montmartre, to the Sacré-Coeur basilica . From here you will have a unique view of Paris and the Eiffel Tower. You will also enjoy the bucolic and picturesque atmosphere of Montmartre.\n\nFrom the Bir-Hakeim bridge\n\nJust one metro station from the Iron Lady, the Bir-Hakeim bridge attracts many tourists. It must be said that the view from this Paris bridge is incomparable. Romantic as can be, this tourist hotspot is the ideal shooting location for many photographs.\n\nStroll across the bridges of Paris!\n\nFrom the Arc de Triomphe\n\nAt the very top of the Avenue des Champs-Élysées, the Arc de Triomphe is also one of the essential viewpoints for admiring the Eiffel Tower. To do this, you will have to climb the 284 steps which will allow you to access the roof terrace of the monument. From up there, you will have one of the most beautiful panoramas of Paris!\n\nFrom the Pompidou Center\n\nIf the Center Pompidou is a wonderful place to spend a day on the theme of culture (cinema, exhibition, library), it is also an admirable spot for contemplating the Eiffel Tower and the roofs of Paris. On the 6th floor of the building, the spectacle is breathtaking.\n\nFrom the Trocadéro esplanade\n\nThe immense esplanade of the Palais de Chaillot is a well-known place for Parisians and tourists to take some beautiful photos of the Eiffel Tower. Slightly below, the Iron Lady displays its best profile, while the gardens offer you a completely unobstructed view.\n\nFind our route from the Trocadéro esplanade to the Iron Lady!"
