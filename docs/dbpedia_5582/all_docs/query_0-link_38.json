        "text": "The Image of Paris introduces students to the role played by the city of Paris in shaping the history and practice of filmmaking. Starting with a general introduction on the history of Paris, followed by a focus on turn of the century urban transformations (mirrored by the first images of the Eiffel Tower and of Parisian life by the Lumière brothers), students will analyze a number of masterpieces of French cinema such as Les Enfants du Paradis by Marcel Carné, and New Wave works by Jean-Luc Godard, François Truffaut, Agnès Varda amongst others.\n\nThey will also explore the concept of the flâneur and investigate the dialogue between cinema and literature through the study of Surrealist films, and of such works as Zazie dans le Métro by Louis Malle and La traversée de Paris by Claude Autant-Lara. The way Paris is seen through foreign eyes will also be an important aspect of the course: the study of 1950s Hollywood portrayal of expat life in the French capital (Funny Face; An American in Paris) will be followed by more contemporary representations of the same theme (Midnight in Paris; Paris I Love You) as by works by non-Wester directors (Eli Lotar, Sarah Maldoror, Alain Bonnamy, Hong Sang-Too, Tsai Ming-liang amongst others).\n\nFinally, the study of 20th century depictions of the Parisian suburbs (La zone by Georges Lacombe; Mon oncle by Jacques Tati) will be paralleled and contrasted with more contemporary narratives (La Haine by Mathieu Kassovitz; Entre les murs by Laurent Cantet). The course format will include a mixture of lectures, screenings and film analysis, practice-based research and field trips to the Cinémathèque Française, La Cité du Cinéma, La Gaîté Lyrique and to other iconic Parisian film locations.\n\nDesign pervades every aspect of the world around us, from how we communicate information and identity, to the tools and systems that help us navigate through physical and digital environments. As design has such a broad reach, it is important that we learn to think about its implications, and the way it is influenced by—and influences—our society. Design Studies is the academic discipline that examines design’s role in our culture, and in our experience of life. By looking at the processes and products of, as well as the discourse on design, we can better understand how the objects and systems we create can solve problems—or, in some cases, create them. The approach for this course will be multidisciplinary and thematic: each week, we will investigate a new topic, considering how design relates to broader issues such as the ethics of consumption, gender, identity, and sustainability, to name just a few. By looking at theoretical essays, historical and contemporary case studies and key texts about design, students will learn to be more critical about how design gets assimilated into our society, our visual culture and our daily experiences, ultimately bringing that understanding into their presentations of their studio practice and their own creativity.\n\n“Queer as being about the self that is at odds with everything around it and has to invent and create and find a place to speak and to thrive and to live.” -bell hooks\n\nContemporary Queer Literature will explore literature written by and about LGBTQ+ people over the course of the last century. In this course we will examine works under a wide literary umbrella, including examples of significant works of fiction, non-fiction, poetry, graphic novels, and film, mainly by writers from the US. Through these works we will explore themes of queer visibility, intersectionality, liberation, and deconstruction of norms. By analyzing the queerness of these works of literature in both form and content, we will collectively work towards building a new queer literary canon. Classes will follow a combined seminar-workshop structure and may include visits, such as to Les Mots à la Bouche (currently Paris’ only LGBTQ+ bookshop) and Chéries-Chéris, an LGBTQ+ film festival. Previous knowledge of queer literature or queer theory are not required, but outside reading and research are expected.\n\nWhether we are reading plays as literature or preparing for a production, the best approach to a play script is to imagine the experience of seeing it on stage—drama + performance = theatre, an artificial world, which paradoxically has much to tell us about our real one. While the dramatic action contained in the play is presented in dialogue with some stage directions, it’s not until it is performed by humans that the characters are developed, the visual representation of the story can be seen and its emotional impact felt. It is the complete spectacle of theatre which presents the story of humans and our interaction in mind, society and history.\n\nWe are going to begin by analyzing and reading plays—to deepen our understanding of character, action, and spectacle. We are also going to examine one of the great controversies in the theatre between the style of realism that has come to dominate plays, movies, and television since the turn of the century, and experimentalism which in a dozen different movements including surrealism, expressionism, and the theatre of the absurd among others, has come to challenge the surface reality we see in everyday dramas and movies and demand theatre give us a deeper representation of experience.\n\nThis literary and stylistic exploration is more than academic—the target will be to bring what we have learned to staging a play(s) for the End of the Year show! The course will feature a series of hands-on workshops for acting and stagecraft as we prepare to occupy the auditorium for May.\n\nTheater: History and Play Analysis is a course designed to do two things: First, it will introduce students to world theatre—its origins in myth and religion, its dynamic interrelationships with society and culture—in the specific historical contexts of different theatres as they developed. Students will study the major periods and developments in the theatre from the ancient Dionysian festivals and Greek tragedy, the William Shakespeare and the Elizabethans, the coming of realism at the turn of the twentieth century and the many avant-garde and Absurdist reactions to it and political and gender issues from the contemporary theatre. Students will learn about approaches to performances and staging and perform scenes from plays.\n\nSecond, the course will introduce students to play texts as dramatic literature, full of the literary themes and conflicts and demanding of the same type of discussion and analysis as stories, novels, poems, and films. Students will learn how to analyze and write about plays as literary texts. The specific project for this semester is Myth, Identity, and Performance within which we’ll look at specific themes such as the individual and society, gender and racial identity, existential identity and what is reality, and drama and social change. We will look at the ways that performance emerged from Shamanistic rituals, the close connection between drama and myth and religion in different societies, and the ways that the performed media has a special ability to help us convey, question, and determine who we are in our cultural and personal, racial and political, gender and linguistic selves.\n\nConsider these three areas and quotes:\n\nMyth: “A man who has a vision is not able to use the power of it until after he has performed the vision on earth for people to see” (Black Ellk, Oglala Sioux shaman. Qtd in Rogan: 9)\n\nGender: “Gender is in no way a stable identity or locus of agency from which various acts proceed; rather, it is an identity tenuously constituted in time—an identity, instituted through a stylized repetition of acts”; gender “is real only to the extent that it is performed.” (“Performative Acts and Gender Constitution” Judith Butler)\n\nPerformance: “Everything that acts is a cruelty. It is upon this idea of extreme action, pushed beyond all limits, that theater must be rebuilt.” (“The Theater and Cruelty.” Antonin Artaud)\n\nConsidering different plays or other performance “texts” through the interpretive framework suggested by these three areas we will try to define what theatre is and is not; ask us to determine which kinds of stories or ideas are best performed, and why performances are so closely associated with the rubrics of myth, gender, and the spectacle of theatre. This exploration demands your active and enthusiastic participation as we discuss, read, and (yes) act out these plays!\n\nThis course provides students with a complete introduction to the history of musical theater, with an overview of 19th century music hall and melodrama and a primary focus on the form that developed in the first half of the twentieth century in England and the United States. The emphasis will be on the broad themes that have influenced the genre, as well as the continuing importance of cultural diversity and ethnic influences on the genre–from English popular culture, Southern US Aftrican-American traditions and the Yiddish culture from the Lower East Side of New York. Students will begin with a solid foundation in historically significant works and canonical authors such as George Bernard Shaw, then progress towards contemporary shows, and how the tradition continues in contemporary theatre and film. The focus of the course will be on discussing the themes of works and the inter-relationship between genres while at the same time developing students’ abilities to write argumentative and analytical essays. Class sessions will include staged readings and a trip to the theatre as well as the viewing of clips of movie-musicals. Learning objectives of the course will be both to analyze works of musical theatre, compare them to non-musical theatrical works, and a foundation for those wishing to eventually perform in the genre.\n\n‘Text’ has somehow survived, thrived even in an increasingly visual, or audio-visual culture. Everyone is writing all the time, ‘texting’ indeed, whether on Twitter or Tinder, creating a Wiki entry, attempting a job application or a thesis, the choice and order of our words determines our future, erotic or academic. This course promises a hands-on and entirely practical, perhaps even actively enjoyable, exploration of writing about art. Though there will of course be some ‘conceptual underpinning’, as it were, of the foundations of the trade, from Diderot to Lucy Lippard, the emphasis will be less on any soi disant theory than on actual zesty practice. We will be dealing with a wide variety of writing and not just on art alone, starting from the basic question of the why and wherefore of such work, from the initial inspiration of any aesthetic reaction to the very real issues of publication, participation and payment even. There will be working trips to museums and galleries, visiting speakers and varied challenges, all with the aim of not only producing actual texts but more importantly students who understand how and what writing can add to their understanding of art and the symbiotic importance of these two long entwined practices.\n\nThis course offers an in-depth exploration of the intricate and continually evolving relationship between art, design, and the world of video games. We will investigate the intersections of video game development with contemporary art and design practices, and students will have the opportunity to:\n\n– Delve into the crucial role of games in various cultures throughout human history. Using foundational texts such as “Man, Play and Games” by Roger Caillois and “Homo Ludens: A Study of the Play Element in Culture” by Johan Huizinga, we will explore the social and cultural aspects of play.\n\n– Trace the origins of modern video game design by examining past works that foreshadowed its elements. This includes exploring Stéphane Mallarmé’s experimental and never-finished “Livre,” interactive plays by Bertold Brecht, and Karlheinz Stockhausen’s musical composition Klavierstück XI, spanning various art forms.\n\n– Learn about cultural movements’ impact on game design; by analyzing movements like Surrealism, Impressionism, and Abstract Expressionism, we will uncover their profound influence on video game design and narratives.\n\n– Investigate experimental approaches to storytelling, world-building, and narrative structures within video games, examining the medium’s historical development.\n\n– Explore how video game culture has deeply impacted contemporary art and design. From video game-inspired art installations to immersive mixed reality experiences and fashion events conducted entirely in virtual environments, we will investigate the convergence of these worlds.\n\nBy the conclusion of this course, students will gain an in-depth understanding of how artists and designers like Corey Arcangel, Angela Washko, and Mishi McDuff have harnessed the video game medium as a powerful form of creative expression. This course welcomes students from various academic backgrounds who share a passion for art, design, and video games. Whether you’re an art and design history enthusiast, a dedicated gamer, or simply curious about the fusion of these realms, this course promises valuable insights into this ever-evolving intersection.\n\nIn her 1974 study Revolution in Poetic Language, Julia Kristeva underlines how the language of European avant-garde poetry is both a symptom of and an instrument for the radical changes we associate culturally, socially and politically with Modernity.\n\nDefining the break or chasm inscribed in history between the long 19th century and the short 20th century, which is epitomized by the First World War, Eric Hobsbawm (The Age of Empire 1875-1914, 1987) describes how ‘under the name of « Modernism » the avant-garde of this period took over most of twentieth-century cultural output’.\n\nRecalling the early twentieth century, the American modernist poet H.D., who lived in Europe all her adult life, says, ‘In 1913 the « modern woman » had no special place on the map … to be « modern » after 1914 … was then a very, very thin line to toe, a very, very frail wire to do a tight-rope act on » (Bid me to live, 1960).\n\nThe course proposes to study the links between poetry and Modernity in the context of European & Anglophone Modernisms from a double perspective. It will begin by addressing the break in style signified by the French symbolists from Baudelaire to Mallarmé, Verlaine, Rimbaud, then moving to the surrealist poets Desnos, Eluard and other poets of the European & Latin-American avant-garde such as Apollinaire, Neruda, Lorca. The students will also be invited to draw links with the visual arts characteristic of Symbolism, Post-Impressionism, Surrealism and Cubism.\n\nThe second part of the course will address International Modernism through both trans-Atlantic & European women poets whose work is characterized by a search for new forms of expression, figures of exile and estrangement and the quest for female identity : H.D., Plath, Akhmatova, Bachman. Particular attention will be accorded to the poetry’s inscription of history and reference will be made to the arts in terms of early cinema, Modern dance and photography.\n\nThe Terra Foundation Research Program gives the opportunity to both undergraduate and graduate students to have a first major academic experience in the field of American art and transatlantic artistic relations.\n\nEvery semester the Liberal Studies Department, along with members of the faculty, will select a group of outstanding PCA students across departments and will offer them the opportunity to take part in a research program based on the collection of the Terra Foundation for American Art Library. The project will culminate in a public presentation at the Terra Foundation Center in Paris.\n\nThe group of selected students will have the opportunity to work as a team and conduct high level research on a specific topic related to American Art. They will have free access to the Terra Library Collection, and training with a librarian who will present the collection and the research facilities available at the Terra Foundation. They will then conduct their research independently and under the supervision of the Liberal Studies Department Chair, and present their findings in English to an audience of art history students from Université Paris Nanterre. Students will also actively collaborate with peers from Université Paris Nanterre through workshops and studio visits (Terra Program I). After completing the first part of the program, students can opt to continue and use the material from their presentation as a basis to write an academic research paper (Terra Program II).\n\nThe PCA/Terra Research Program is suited for all students interested in the history of art and, particularly for those interested in American art. It is an opportunity to work closely with the Terra Library’s unique collection of books, have a first major experience within the academic research world, and improve one’s research, writing and presentation skills. The monthly workshops and the final presentation will also be occasions to meet peers from French universities and compare research methodologies in an international and interdisciplinary context. The program is open to undergraduate, graduate, and visiting students.\n\nThe course Philosophy of the Image aims at addressing key philosophical concepts that have been shaping the contemporary debate and informing art practices in recent years, and that are at the forefront of artistic research today. Key concepts will be discussed in conjunction with specific artworks and art practices in which they manifest themselves in order to expose on a one hand how they inform the production of artists and on the other hand how they are transformed by those very practices they affect.\n\nEach lesson will discuss an art/theory couple: a concept will be analysed in conjunction with an artwork through the reading and discussion of theoretical passages and the analysis of the selected works. Through the dialogue with philosophy art will be regarded as a field of knowledge in its own right, standing on equal footing with the theoretical disciplines with which it dialogues: a field that has a bearing on reality, contributing both to our understanding of the world and to our capacity to shape it. The course provides an introduction to the core conceptual issues of our time via a combined analysis of philosophical theories and art practices in order to improve the students’ capacity to navigate the most relevant ideas of our present as well as the conceptual dimensions of contemporary art.\n\nThe course “Gender Studies: Performance, Cinema, Still Image” engages with interdisciplinary approaches to the study and critique of culture and society. Building on some “classics” of continental thinking and cultural theory, we will explore recent Feminist, Queer, Postcolonial, New Media Art theories and experience. The course explores how cinema, performance, and still images work as a “technology of gender,” how they construct subject positions and identities, and what these constructions can tell us about how gender structures our culture.\n\nBecause of the nature of the course and the amount of time that must be dedicated to screening the films, to gallery visits, and analysis of photo images and advertising, this class will be very different than a traditional lecture-based course. The course will require students to be self-motivated learners and emphasize individual readings of the assigned articles and thoughtful individual critiques of the films and readings. It will explore a variety of contemporary visual imaging technologies that privilege the body and encourage students to develop critical analytical skills to interrogate the world in which they currently live. Analyzing the production, circulation, and consumption of visual cultural productions, the course will ask what the roles of visuality and performance are in constructing ideologies of gender, race, sexuality, and national identity.\n\nFrom the design of the first wheel in ancient Mesopotamia to the harnessing of alternative energy in the future, this course examines the role of technology in driving material, social, cultural, and artistic change. Ever since Palaeolithic caveman domesticated fire and learned to carve stone tools, humans have been driven by an insatiable desire to discover, harness, and design new technologies to purposefully modify their material environment. As an individual and collective endeavour, technological innovation is the result of human ingenuity fostered by specific social, material, and cultural conditions. Although new technologies are intended to solve practical problems, reduce human labour, and improve the quality of human life, changes in technology can elicit a host of unintended consequences with potentially evolutionary effects on society, the environment, and the human experience.\n\nBy analysing the paradigms set forth for scientific ‘progress’ the class will analyse how technology can be seen alternately perceived as the culprit driving social inequalities (i.e. the Marxist response to the Industrial Revolution) or as a possible solution to recalibrate the ‘great divide’ between first and third world countries (i.e. the ‘democratisation’ of knowledge in the Digital Age). Weekly topics will examine how technological developments influenced communication and transportation systems, energy, labour, war, and the economy. We will investigate how technology can reformulate human relationships and influence class, gender and artistic expression. As we examine the ethical dilemmas posed by new technologies, we will ask ourselves: Which technological changes constitute a radical break from the past? What has human culture gained from the experience? What have we lost? What is the role of the artist in designing new technologies? If the promise of technology is to improve our lives – has this been accomplished?\n\nOur innumerable conceptions of technology change as quickly as the technologies themselves. How then do we define technology? How does technology define us? Our aims in this class are to develop our vocabulary and theoretical framework for discussing the interactions of music with technological developments in instruments, musical creation/performance, recording, media, and industry. Notably, we will focus on the cultural, social, and aesthetic lives and meanings of technologies, thinking about how musical technologies—and the various ideas about these technologies—impact our experiences of the (musical) world around us. Topics will range from: the Futurists, the phonograph, Musique Concrète, sounds of urban life, turntablism, artificial intelligence, music apps, and so forth, and will open up discussions into the “aura”/“liveness”/mediation, the politics of capturing sound and how that taps into issues of representation, authenticity, gender, and race, the recognition and/or creation of sound ecologies, the constantly evolving relationship between what is music, sound, and noise, the implications of digitization and digital culture, among many other critical inquiries. We will be drawing from a variety of different source materials in this class, for example: video clips, theoretical writings, music lyrics, written accounts, musical examples, images, and many hands-on demonstrations of instruments and other tools. Course evaluation is based on class discussion, write-ups, a mid-term, and a final project.\n\nMuseums, as all cultural institutions, face a number of pivotal challenges in the contemporary world. From inclusion and accessibility, going through a fundamental rethinking of collections presentation and museographic techniques, museums and exhibition spaces play a central role in both making culture accessible to all and in mirroring the diversity and richness of cultural heritage. This course will address a number of crucial issues related to the field of museology (the study of the museum institution and its shifting role in society) that will be explored by privileging a contemporary and global perspective: starting from the analysis of the role played by museums in the 21st century, students will be introduced to the concept of New Museology and to such fields as cultural preservation and mediation in the context of a global questioning of the discipline. The history of the museum institution itself from the 15th century to the contemporary moment, as the evolution of its political, social and cultural missions throughout the ages will be part of the course.\n\nThe diversity of the Parisian exhibition environment, going from major museums to independent galleries and exhibition spaces, will contribute to connect the students’ theoretical work to the reality of the field. The course format will include lectures, practice-based research, guest talks by collectors and curators, and field work in a number of public and private cultural institutions.\n\nOur innumerable conceptions of technology change as quickly as the technologies themselves. How then do we define technology? How does technology define us? Our aims in this class are to develop our vocabulary and theoretical framework for discussing the interactions of music with technological developments in instruments, musical creation/performance, recording, media, and industry. Notably, we will focus on the cultural, social, and aesthetic lives and meanings of technologies, thinking about how musical technologies—and the various ideas about these technologies—impact our experiences of the (musical) world around us. Topics will range from: the Futurists, the phonograph, Musique Concrète, sounds of urban life, turntablism, artificial intelligence, music apps, and so forth, and will open up discussions into the “aura”/“liveness”/mediation, the politics of capturing sound and how that taps into issues of representation, authenticity, gender, and race, the recognition and/or creation of sound ecologies, the constantly evolving relationship between what is music, sound, and noise, the implications of digitization and digital culture, among many other critical inquiries. We will be drawing from a variety of different source materials in this class, for example: video clips, theoretical writings, music lyrics, written accounts, musical examples, images, and many hands-on demonstrations of instruments and other tools. Course evaluation is based on class discussion, write-ups, a mid-term, and a final project.\n\nDance as an art form is interdisciplinary by nature combining elements of the visual, oral, literary and performative arts. The study of dance history and culture allows students to be introduced to the social and cultural foundation of dance as a form of expression while discovering the variety of connections it establishes with such disciplines as film, photography, fashion, stage and set design, and the visual arts.\n\nThe course will start with an introduction of the history of dance from the nineteenth century to the contemporary moment. While tracing the work and influence of major international choreographers/dancers we will contemplate the significance of dance more broadly through sessions on such topics as street dance, dance in non-western contexts, and dance therapy. We will thus tackle the following questions: what is a “dance culture”? What cultural assumptions determine who “can” and “cannot” dance? Where does dance happen and how does location influence the dance experience? What do artists – and you as artists – see in dancers’ movement? How do they – and you – depict motion? How can one describe and write about the experience of watching dance? What is “kinesthetic empathy” and could it be used to write about and respond to dance?\n\nThe course format includes a mixture of lecture, discussion, practice-based research and viewings of live and recorded performance.\n\nThis course is designed to introduce the student to the artistic and historical tradition of cosmopolitan Paris.\n\nDuring the course the rich cultural and historical heritage of Paris, as it has come down to us from the Middle Ages to the present day, will be explored through a dynamic program of venturing into the city to learn about its cultural resources.\n\nSocial, political and economic changes have been paralleled by scientific, philosophical and artistic developments. For centuries there has been a passion for change and renewal, most clearly of all in the visual arts. Students will learn to read with their eyes and experience works of art in person, analyzing various complex artworks; visiting historic sites, monuments and museums; and considering the city’s remarkable urban development and contributions to architecture and design.\n\nThe focus will be on several historically organized sections: the development of Romanesque and Gothic art in France; the royal and imperial patrimony of the 17th to the 19th centuries; the achievements of the Parisian avant-gardes from the end of the 19th century until the Second World War; and, finally, postmodern Paris. Classroom discussions will alternate with visits to artistic and historical sites in and around the city.\n\nWhile searching for alternative styles and means of expression, modern artists were attracted to the unusual and exotic. Both pre-historic art, early ancient, and “primitive” art (the traditional indigenous products of Africa, Oceania and North America) penetrated the western artistic world and had a determining impact on the aesthetic of the 20th century. The purpose of the course is to contextualize and analyze art and architecture from these cultures, and to describe their afterlife in modernist production. It will also describe the social changes associated with this attraction to “primitive” art forms. Key aesthetic discourses of the period will be articulated, offering crucial insight into the complex and always changing nexus between culture, politics and representation. The course will include field trips to the antiquities collections at the Louvre, to Musée du Quai Branly, and the Centre Pompidou to examine both primitive and ancient objects and images together. Students will be exposed to art historical and post-colonial critiques of the appropriation of past forms and the complex visual and ideological implications of the wholesale designation of cultures as “other”.\n\nThe industrial revolution made new forms of technology and mass communication possible, allowing not only for the mechanical reproduction of the image and its circulation on a large scale, but also new materials, new processes, and new media. These developments have had a decisive impact on visual culture, on aesthetic categories, and on the status of the image. The aesthetic revolution began in Montmartre in the 1880s, reached a climax in SoHo in the 1960s, and continues to shape visual culture and aesthetic debates today. What status does the image have? What is the difference between a Brillo box produced by industrial means and one produced by Andy Warhol? Does a distinction between high art and kitsch still matter in the age of Pop? How have the transformations in visual and material culture affected the productive activity of artists, or conversely, how does artists’ activity take up and critically remark upon these transformations? How has the Pop aesthetic translated and transmuted in contemporary global culture? These are the kinds of questions that this course will explore.\n\nConceived as an introduction to the history of photography, this course will focus on the first half of the 20th century. The main movements and aesthetics characterizing that period will be examined through the work of various international photographers. Arranged thematically while following a chronological progression, it will approach each theme in connection with a major photographer whose singularity will help understand the particularities and issues of the subject and put them into perspective. As a product of light and chemistry, photography has always been determined by technical parameters. We will address these parameters and see how they shaped the history of the medium and what we can learn from them today.\n\nSince its invention, photography has had an ambivalent status, regarded by some only as a way of recording or copying things, while others considered it as an actual means of artistic creation. This constant dichotomy between document and art will constitute the common thread of this course. We will look at it with a critical eye, examining photographs through all the stages of their life, from the moment they were taken to the moment they were printed, published, exhibited or discovered by others. In doing so, we will be able to examine how the status of these photographs often changed during the various stages of their history, going from mere document to renowned work of art.\n\nBased mostly on the observation and comment of photographic images, this course aims to start a discussion and foster debate on photography, its specificities and the way they were developed and used in the first half of the 20th century.\n\nThis course is an introduction to the history of photography from the 1960s up to the recent practices of photographers and artists working with photographic technologies in the context of postmodernity. It will explore a broad range of contemporary photographs from around the world. The primary task of the course will be to familiarize the student with the key figures in the photographic history and the artistic movements of the period. By doing this, we shall observe how the media increased and changed. Over the last three decades photography managed to become a fully recognized art form. It entered galleries, museums, libraries and private collections as a highly valuable object. The medium seems to have entered the realm of fine arts. We shall evaluate the relationship between photography and the visual arts in general. One of the key questions for analysis will concern the increasing permeability of boundaries between media. We will pay particular attention to the impact of digital technologies on the medium. We will engage in discussion and debate regarding the meaning, relevance and significance of both theoretical developments and actual practices.\n\nThis course explores the flourishing theoretical debate around architecture and design in the Modern Era. By providing students with the knowledge and skills required to understand and analyze their built environment, we will focus on significant periods that have marked architecture in Europe until the 20th century. By adopting Paris as a paradigmatic area of study, students will be introduced to the redefinition of a “National Style” in 1840-ies France while focusing on the interpretation of history in contemporary architectural language. Starting from the industrial revolution, the course will then cover the prevailing theoretical movements that have characterized and formed Modern Architectural History. We will then look into emerging artistic and building forms in North America and Europe starting with the School of Chicago, and moving forward with the Arts & Crafts and Art Nouveau movements. Students will be also introduced to the influential avant-garde schools such as the Art Déco and the Bauhaus before approaching the International Style. Although the course offers a diachronic approach of history, architecture and interior design will be also tackled through a thematic analysis with a series of exercises (in-class activities; field trips and visual analysis) where students will assess, explore and compare built structures in our urban environment.\n\nHistory of New Media is an overview of the pioneering artists and scientists who have brought about the dissolution of boundaries that have traditionally existed between the artistic and technological disciplines. The course will survey the work and ideas of artists who have explored new interactive and interdisciplinary forms, as well as engineers and mathematicians who have developed information technologies and influential scientific and philosophical ideologies that have influenced the arts. The course begins with seminal artistic movements and genres as well as the study of the invention of information technologies and new human-machine paradigms that have come to define digital culture. This broad historical analysis will help illuminate an understanding of the emerging digital arts and its aesthetics, strategies, trends, and socio-cultural aspirations. Central to this analysis will be an understanding of key concepts for the interpretation of evolving multimedia forms: including integration, interactivity, hypermedia, immersion, and narrativity. The course will reveal how these primary elements of contemporary media have roots in experimental electronic and performance art prior to the digital era. Students will develop commentary in the form of critical projects through in-depth analysis of historical trends and seminal work in the media arts and information sciences.\n\nThis course interrogates the conceptual and historical connections between Experimental Film, Video Art, and Contemporary multi-disciplinary practices. Throughout the course of 15 weeks students will be guided through a thematically oriented survey of moving-image artworks, related readings, and assignments. Each class is organized with screenings of both Modern and Contemporary works to emphasize often understated connections between these two periods of artistic production. In doing so, we engage with canonical works of Modern Art in a way that connects them to the spaces, materials, and movements of today. Boundaries between sculpture, installation, film, and video will be simultaneously complicated and defined. Putting works from across art history in conversation with one another will help us understand how Contemporary practitioners reference, build upon, and even reject the work of the past. Working in this thematically organized fashion also allows us to focus on often unrecognized or marginalized artists while dissecting pertinent art-historical narratives.\n\nThis class holds communal projections as essential for properly experiencing many works of moving-image art. During each class, screenings will be followed by a discussion section where the works are examined in relation to weekly readings and previously analyzed artworks.\n\nThis course will present works by artists who have – at different times and for diverse reasons –shocked and angered the general public, the art establishment and the mass media.\n\nSpecific incidents will be examined in order to understand how these incidents occurred, with attention given to the different factions involved. For example, why have some works of art been considered obscene? Who made that decision? The way these incidents concluded (and any subsequent impacts) will also be scrutinized.\n\nThe course will focus on controversies about individual works that have ‘violated’ moral norms and taboos; challenged generally accepted art standards; or criticized the established social, economic or political order. Interfaces between artists and the public, and between artists and the art establishment, will be analysed. We will also look at the mutual lack of comprehension that often exists between artists and the mass media and how their relationship has evolved.\n\nThis series of lectures will examine how the concepts of “acceptable” or “unacceptable” are developed and maintained, , focusing on several themes: transgressing aesthetic norms; conceptual ruptures; sex, nudity and pornography; destabilization of social and political order; subversive photography; destruction and vandalism.\n\nThis course will examine relationships between art and politics in the past and, more importantly, today. The purpose of the course is not to discuss social and political problems in themselves or to propose solutions. Instead, it will show how engaged artists aim to raise awareness and change attitudes.\n\nDuring the last few decades society has been profoundly changed by events including the dissolution of the Soviet Union and the fall of the Berlin wall at the end of the 1980s, September 11th, conflicts in the Middle East and other regions, and the worldwide financial crisis – together with globalization, growing awareness of the threat to the environment, and the Covid-19 pandemic. How have artists responded to these and other political and social changes?\n\nTo quote the art critic and philosopher Boris Groys: “Art has its own power in the world, and is as much a force in the power play of global politics today as it once was in the arena of cold war politics.” However, the relationships between art and politics are complex. Some artists are primarily concerned with poverty, social malaise, human rights or racism, while others focus on multinational corporations and environmental destruction. Still others represent the individual’s powerlessness in the face of totalitarian regimes, corruption or the influence of the media.\n\nArtists’ work differs according to their explicit or implicit aims. It is also influenced by their own socio-economic background and culture and those of their intended audience. Interfaces between artists and the public, as well as between artists and the art establishment, will be analyzed. In addition, we will look at the mutual lack of comprehension that often exists between artists and the mass media, and how this relationship has evolved.\n\nGoing beyond modernist categories, a new type of artwork was developed in the second half of the 20th century – defined by the ways in which places, spaces and materials are used. Site-specific art intersected with land art, process art, performance art, conceptual art, installation art and public art. These various artistic practices can be seen as variations on the concept of Gesamtkunstwerk – a ‘total work of art’.\n\nMarcel Duchamp’s ready-mades and Kurt Schwitters’ Merzbau drew attention to the space in which the work was shown, while Minimalism established space as the work in itself. Since then, stimulating considerable controversy, installations have been challenging perceptions of the ephemeral and of the surrounding space. They have provided material for reflection on the relationships between the space and the work of art, as well as on the mechanisms of the art world.\n\nThe organization of space is based on the artist’s choice. It determines the dialectical relationship between the artist and the spectator. The interactive relationship between art and life – established through an appropriate transformation and articulation of space – began an artistic mode that was something entirely apart.\n\nThis course will address historic and contemporary installations by considering the role of space. We will discuss space, materials and site, focusing on several themes: sculpture in the expanded field; enclosure of space; overloaded space; live installation; immersive space; public space; and construction/deconstruction.\n\nIt is in all their complexity that we look at the artworks of today and we tend to read the multiple struggles and questions that they make visible. This complexity is not only the result of the hybridity of artistic practices, the media used, but also the way artists draw their resources from social, political, scientific practices and refer to them or appropriate them. The necessity of critical analysis of knowledge, relations of domination, and norms shapes the landscape of art today.\n\nThis course will present various performative practices and this will be approached by discussing the works of visual artists, choreographers, directors, activists or musicians such as: Claude Cahun and Marcel Moore, Delphine Seyrig and Carole Roussopoulos, Letícia Parente, Füsun Onur, Laurie Anderson, and Talking Heads. Established works by Pina Bausch, John Cage and by contemporary artists as Gisèle Vienne, Rebecca Chaillon, and Kae Tempest will also be analyzed in order to introduce the historical, political, plastic, musical, and textual dimensions of performance. The back and forth between the field of art and that of social practices, and the relationship between live performance and the visual arts will be examined. Performance will thus be explored as a vast space of immaterial practices which uses a specific vocabulary – score, ritual, lecture, reenactment, carnivalesque. Examples will include, amongst others Esther Ferrer, Rabih Mroué (lecture-performance), Eszter Salamon (the artist as a museum), Big Art Group (the stage as a political space for live image production), Meredith Monk and Laurie Anderson (the voice), Antonia Baehr (the score), Latifa Laâbiss (the ritual and the vigil). The course format will include a mixture of lectures, screenings, practice-based research, practical exercises and field trips."
