Exclusions apply and benefits vary.\n\nDownload the current list of venues participating in the ASTC Passport Program (Effective May 1, 2024):\n\nASTC Passport Participant List, May 1, 2024 – October 31, 2024 – Updated July 22 (2-page)\n\nASTC Passport Participant List, May 1, 2024 – October 31, 2024 – Updated July 22 (21-page, 6-pt font)\n\nASTC Passport Participant List, May 1, 2024 – October 31, 2024 – Updated July 22 (37-page, 11-pt font)\n\nImportant Update\n\nPlease check each institution’s website for more information about their operations, including any requirements for advanced reservations.\n\nBefore You Travel\n\nCheck for exclusions. Make sure the science center or museum you are visiting is not located within 90 miles of either your home residence and the science center or museum that you belong to. This distance is measured as a linear radius, not driving distance.\n\nReview the family admittance policy of the venue that you intend to visit. Call before you visit to confirm your Passport Program benefits.\n\nPack your ID (or other proof of residence). Admissions staff reserve the right to request proof of residence for benefits to apply. Passport Program venues requesting proof of residence are marked by “Proof of Residence Required“.\n\nPack your membership card. Passport Program venues are not required to grant benefits to visitors who forget their cards. There is no universal database with all Passport visitors’ member data for admission staff to reference. Some venues will allow you to call your home institution to confirm your membership, but they are under no obligation to do so.\n\nLost your card? Please contact your home science center or museum. ASTC does not issue or administer membership cards.\n\nStill have questions? Read our Frequently Asked Questions."
