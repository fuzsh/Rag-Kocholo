Hear from 2017 graduate Chelsea McManus:\n\nRole: Business Advisor at Shell PLC\n\nIn my current role, I am the advisor to the Chief of Staff to the CEO. The purpose of my role is to ensure that the office of the Chief of Staff is delivering on the goals of the CEO, which combines developing strategy, setting key priorities, and driving continuous operational effectiveness. My education at King's taught me to think critically, to understand and decipher complex ideas, and to think creatively about solutions. My top career achievement to date has been having the opportunity to shape company strategy in a way that drives change and solves complex problems.\n\nChelsea's top career tip:\n\nMy advice would be to keep an open mind, and to consider both what you are interested in, as well as how you like to work, when considering your career."
