His/her choice is not limited to the lists of the départements included in the jurisdiction of the tribunal.\n\nArticle L123-5 On the request of the commissaire enquêteur or the President of the enquiry commission and when the specific\n\nnature of the enquiry demands it, the President of the administrative tribunal or the magistrate he/she has delegated may appoint an expert to assist the commissaire enquêteur or the President of the enquiry commission. The cost of this expertise is borne by the developer.\n\nArticle L123-6 Commissaires enquêteurs or members of the enquiry commission may not be appointed if they have a personal\n\ninterest in the operation or have functions preventing them from being appointed, notably if those functions are performed within the authority, body or department in charge of the project development, the project supervision or the control of the operation concerned by the enquiry.\n\nThe provisions of the previous paragraph may be extended, under the conditions set by a Conseil d'Etat decree, to persons who have held these functions.\n\nArticle L123-7 At least fifteen days before the enquiry is opened and throughout its duration, the competent authority informs the\n\npublic by all appropriate means, notably in the places concerned by the enquiry and, according to the scale and nature of the project, via the written press or by audiovisual communication, of the purpose of the enquiry, the names and capacities of the commissaire enquêteur or the members of the enquiry commission, the date on which the enquiry is opened, the place of the enquiry and its duration.\n\nThe duration of the enquiry must not be less than one month.

Work on these structures may not begin before the end of this period.\n\nFor works as defined in the first paragraph of the present V, as well as for works and structures requiring authorisation or a declaration as stipulated in the Code de l'Urbanisme and which are likely, because of their nature, size or location, to hinder the natural flow of the waterway, the competent authority in order to adjudicate on matters of town and country planning obtains the agreement of the Préfet who has a period of two months from receipt of the declaration or the application to oppose the works or to prescribe the necessary modifications. The works may not begin before the end of this period.\n\nV bis. - In the wetlands known as \"strategic zones for water management\" mentioned in 3 of II, the Préfet may, by means of a ruling, oblige the owners and operators to refrain from any act likely to damage the nature, the role and the maintenance and conservation of the zone, notably drainage, filling, or ploughing of grassland.\n\nVI. - The decree issued by the Préfet may identify, where appropriate, any existing or missing elements which hinder the objective of the constraint, and whose removal, modification or implementation is made obligatory. The cost of the works and compensation for the prejudice which may result from these works must be met by the authority which requested the constraint. However, if the aforementioned elements belong to the State or state-owned institutions, the state must meet the cost of such works.\n\nVII. - Where one of the purposes for which the constraint has been set up involves public bodies of facilities carrying out, works or activities, the owners and operators are required at all times to grant state employees responsible for their development, maintenance or use access to land within the perimeter of the zones concerned by the constraint.\n\nVIII. - The declaration of constraints mentioned in I give rise to compensation for owners of land in zones affected if such constraints create a material, direct and undeniable prejudice. This compensation is to be paid by the authority which has requested the constraint. This compensation is determined, if no out-of-court settlement can be reached, by the competent compulsory purchase judge in the département.\n\nIX. - Material damage affecting crops, cultivation, livestock (whether dead or alive), motorised land vehicles and buildings caused by flooding linked to the temporary storage of water in zones where constraints are present as mentioned in II give rise to compensation for the occupants.\n\nHowever, persons or public bodies having contributed through their acts or negligence to the existence of damage are excluded from benefiting from compensation proportionately to the extent to which the said damages can be apportioned to them. This compensation shall be paid by the authority which requested the declaration of constraint affecting the zone.\n\nDamage affecting crops, cultivation, buildings and livestock (whether dead or alive), belonging to agricultural holdings are assessed within the framework of local protocols of agreement. Where these do not exist, damage is assessed in accordance with the provisions of Article L.361-10 of the Code rural.\n\nX. - For a period of ten years beginning on the date of publication of the decree issued by the Préfet which declares the realisation of the works mentioned in VI or, if such works are not necessary, beginning on the date of publication of the decree issued by the Préfet declaring one or more of the constraints mentioned in I, the owner of a plot of land which is the object of one of these constraints may demand its partial or total acquisition by the local authority which has requested the declaration of constraint.\n\nThis right of abandonment is exercised in accordance with the provisions of Articles L. 230-1 and in compliance with the Code de l'Urbanisme. The owner may, at the same time, demand partial or total acquisition of other plots of land if the existence of the constraint compromises their use or operation in conditions similar to those existing before the declaration of the constraint.\n\nXI. - In the zones mentioned in II, the communes or public institutions cooperating between communes may declare a right of pre-emption under the conditions defined Article L. 211-1 of the Code de l'Urbanisme. They may delegate this right to the local authority having requested the declaration of constraint.\n\nUpdated 04/10/2006 - Page 19/201\n\nENVIRONMENTAL CODE XII. - A Conseil d'Etat decree determines the conditions of application of the present Article.\n\nArticle L211-13 (Act no. 2003-699 of 30 July 2003 Article 53 of the Official Journal of 31 July 2003) (Act no. 2005-157 of 23 February 2005 Article 132 V, VI, VII, VIII Official Journal of 24 February 2005)\n\nI. - Notwithstanding any other provisions to the contrary, the State, the local authorities or their groupings which have acquired land located in temporary flood and surface run-off water storage areas or in mobility zones as defined in Article 211-12 of the present Code may, on the drawing-up or renewal of rural leases defined in Title I of Book IV of the Code rural referring to this land, prescribe methods of ground use to the acquirer in order to prevent flooding or to avoid the aggravation of potential damage.\n\nI bis. - Notwithstanding any other provisions to the contrary, the State, the local authorities or their groupings which have acquired land located in strategic zones for water management mentioned in article L. 211-12 may, on the drawing-up or renewal of the rural leases defined in Title I of Book IV of the Code rural referring to this land, prescribe methods of ground use to the acquirer in order to preserve or restore the land's nature or role.\n\nII. - Notwithstanding Title I of Book IV of the Code rural, the administrativ"
