Whereas Janacekia and certain Janeia are synonyms of Acharax, other alleged Janeia are shown to be clinopisthins such as Dystactella and Clinopistha. Morphological analysis supports DNA studies suggesting Acharax and Solemya are monophyletic, thereby challenging recent taxonomies placing them in separate families or superfamilies. The primary ligaments of Acharax and Solemya are basically similar (opisthodetic, parivincular, attached at nymphae), the main differences being placement: external in Acharax but slightly internal (submarginal) in Solemya. Character analyses suggest the external nymphae of Acharax are plesiomorphic, arising by the Early Devonian, whereas the submarginal placement of the nymphae in Solemya is shown to be a Mesozoic apomorphy involving depression and secondary enclosure of the ligament and nymphae by a shelly outer layer. Nymphal enclosure has had two concomitant effects: 1) dorsal occlusion of the posterior adductor muscle; 2) fusion of the nymphae to internal buttresses that plesiomorphically functioned as simple reinforcement for the anterior margin of the posterior adductor muscles whereas, by exaptation, they become apomorphically modified to serve as supporting braces for the submarginal nymphae by dorsally uniting with them.\n\nJack Bowman Bailey.

Throughout their roughly 475-million-year history, the Solemyidae have remained among the most conservative of bivalves in both morphology and chemosymbiotic autecology (Seilacher, 1990; Cope, 2000; Imhoff et al., 2003; Kiel, 2010; Bailey, 2011). Consequently, many fossil species have been reasonably placed within two ancient and enduring genera, Solemya Lamarck, 1818, and Acharax Dall, 1908. Commonly called “awning shells”, both genera uniquely share the same thickened frill of radially pleated periostracum extending well beyond the calcified shell margins (e.g., see various figures of Pojeta, 1988; Dell, 1995; Taylor et al., 2008; Oliver et al, 2011; Walton, 2015). The frill is an ancient character well documented in Pennsylvanian Acharax (see Bailey, 2011) with possible traces in an Ordovician antecedent, Ovatoconcha Cope, 1996 (see Cope, 2000, 2002).\n\nIn Solemya, minor differences in the ligament are used as a basis for division into subgenera. Although the resulting system has been confusing and its application often inconsistent, several studies (Pojeta, 1988; Carter, 1990; Taylor et al., 2008; Kamenev, 2009; Bailey, 2011) have provided much needed clarification. However, significant problems remain especially regarding the precise relation between Solemya and Acharax, whose intimate phyletic ties have been obscured by: 1) incomplete understanding of the chronological morphogenesis of the diagnostically important ligaments and their associated structures; and 2) confusion generated through the widespread and persistent use of the ambiguous names, Janeia King, 1850 and Janacekia Růžička and Řehoř, 1978 along with their attendant mischaracterizations of Paleozoic solemyids.\n\nTerminology, Figure Scales, and Repositories\n\nDue to inherent ambiguities, certain traditional terms used to describe the bivalve shell and its orientation are sometimes replaced herein by unbiased and directionally neutral terms proposed by Bailey (2009, 2011; see also Carter et al., 2012). This system was designed to be useful in describing fossil bivalve specimens where recognition of the anterior and posterior ends of the shell is problematic due either to differences of opinion or data insufficiency. The system is especially useful in the present study inasmuch as edmondioids and several other posteriorly elongate fossil taxa have been historically confused with solemyids, all of which are anteriorly elongate.\n\nBeginning with Children (1823, p. 300) the archaic spelling “Solenomya” [nomen vanum] and its variation, “Solenimya” were widely used by early authors in lieu of Lamarck’s (1818, p. 488) original spelling, Solemya. To avoid confusion in the text, uncorrected orthographies are here limited to the Appendix.\n\nIllustrations of early authors reproduced herein are 600 dpi grayscale digital scans of the original physical publications, not screen captures borrowed from various online sources. Because authors rarely mention the size or dimensions of illustrated specimens, 1 centimeter bar scales shown in the figures herein were measured directly from the original printed sources.\n\nRepository abbreviations are as follows: BGS - British Geological Survey, Keyworth, Nottinghamshire, UK; UM - University of Missouri, Columbia, MO; USNM - United States National Museum of Natural History, Washington, D.C. The specimen E1114 is in the collections of the Sedgwick Museum, Cambridge, UK.\n\nSOLEMYA, ACHARAX, AND THE SOLEMYIDAE\n\nLigament and Support Structures in Solemya and Acharax\n\nIn the Solemyidae an understanding of the ligament and its supporting structures is fundamental in ascertaining the systematic relations among constituent genera. In the familiar solemyids Acharax and Solemya, the ligament is amphidetic, composed of two principal components: 1) a dorsally arched, parivincular portion posterior to the beaks (= primary ligament) consisting of an inner fibrous layer (Figure 1, lgf) attaching on each side at insertion grooves, bordered by narrow ridges (i.e., nymphae) (Figure 1, ne, ns) that function as attachment sites for an outer lamellar layer (Figure 1, lgl); and 2) an anterior extension (not shown) of the lamellar outer layer in front of the beaks that is often asymmetrically attached between the left and right valves (see Carter, 1990, p. 174; Bailey, 2011, p. 19).\n\nIn Acharax the primary ligament is external, attaching at external nymphae (Figure 1, Figure 2, ne) and insertion grooves (Figure 1, gr). However, in all subgenera of Solemya the primary ligament is sunken to a shallow internal (= submarginal) position immediately below the posterodorsal margins of the shell. There it is attached to a pair of submarginal nymphae and flanking grooves (Figure 1, ns, gr and Figure 2, ns), each supported at its anterior end by attachment to a ridge-like buttress (= rib, ridge, prop, or clavicle of various authors), i.e., a narrow thickening of the valve that extends along the anterior margin of the posterior adductor muscle (Figure 2, btc). Submarginal nymphae in Solemya are conventionally termed chondrophores (e.g., Dall, 1908) thus obscuring their homological relation to external nymphae. Unlike Solemya, the internal buttress (Figure 2, bts) of Acharax is not attached to nymphae and is variable in development, sometimes prominent but often weak or obsolescent. Peripheral thickenings of adductor attachment sites in other bivalve taxa (Bailey, 1983; Taylor et al., 2008) suggest that the buttress in Acharax functions in part for added reinforcement of the thin valve along the posterior adductor margin (Bailey, 2016).\n\nBecause of its remarkable similarities to Solemya in gross morphology, Acharax was originally recognized as a subgenus of Solemya (see Dall, 1908, p. 2). Even the diagnostic primary ligament, aside from its external vs. submarginal location, is fundamentally similar in the two genera (Figure 1; see also Bailey, 2011, text-fig. 2). The homologies seem obvious. Together, Acharax and Solemya arguably form a monophyletic group (i.e., clade) in which the external ligament and nymphae of Acharax, the probable plesiomorphic condition (Figure 1A-B), later achieved submarginal (apomorphic) status in Solemya through depression of the nymphae and ligament below the posterodorsal margin (Figure 1C-E), along with attendant overgrowth of a thin outer prismatic layer (Carter, 1990, fig. 17; Bailey, 2011; Carter, et al., 2012, fig. 216). As noted by Waller (1998, p. 19), the outer prismatic layer (Figure 1, opl) covering the ligament “is a secondary [apomorphic] feature that is not present in the earliest ontogeny of the dissoconch...nor in the earliest members of the Solemyoidea and Solemyidae.” Depression of the nymphae may have been facilitated by the natural tendency of the thin shells and periostracum (Figure 1, pe) to crack and repair in the umbonal and ligamental regions during growth (Waller, 1990; Bailey, 2011).\n\nIn Solemya, depression of the nymphae below the hinge margin has resulted in: 1) fusion of the anterior end of each nymph directly to the internal buttress such that the function of the buttress becomes altered by exaptation from an original one of reinforcing the attachment site of the posterior adductor muscle along its anterior border (Figure 2A, bts) to one of serving as a supporting brace or prop for the submarginal nymph (Figure 2B, btc; see also Bailey, 2016); and 2) dorsal occlusion, either by embayment, truncation, or intersection, of the posterior adductor muscle by the nymph. In the case of intersection, the posterior adductor partially continues around the obstructing nymph, passing posteriorly above it (Figure 2B, pao). The resulting cross-cutting relationship firmly establishes the submarginal posterior ligament and nymphae in Solemya as apomorphic traits (see also pl. 4, fig. 2 of Pojeta, 1988, and figs. 3h, 3i of Hryniewicz et al., 2014).\n\nProxy Characters Linked to Nymphal Placement\n\nIn Acharax and Solemya, nymphal placement has a significant influence on the internal morphology of the shell. If neither nymphae nor ligament are preserved, the two genera may nevertheless be distinguished from each other in internal molds or incomplete specimens so long as traces of the buttresses and posterior adductor scars are present. Serving as proxies of nymphal placement, two functionally linked character states are here designated as follows: Where the nymphae are external (a plesiomorphy), the buttress will be simple and the posterior adductor will be entire. Where the nymphae are submarginal (an apomorphy), the buttress will be compound, and the posterior adductor will be occluded. In Acharax: 1) the buttress is simple (Figure 2A, bts), that is, from the anterior limit of the posterior adductor scar, it extends dorsally to the underside of the umbo without any evident attachment to a nymph; and 2) in the absence of a submarginal nymph the posterior adductor muscle is entire, that is, whole and unobstructed (Figure 2A, pae). The condition is reversed in Solemya: 1) the buttress is compound, that is, it adjoins the anterior terminus of the submarginal nymph, the resulting configuration of the two forming a “7” shape (Figure 2B, btc); and 2) the posterior adductor is thereby occluded, becoming dorsally truncated, embayed, or intersected by the nymph (Figure 2B, pao).\n\nOne additional proxy needs to be discussed. Among fossil solemyids, paired external nymphae are often visibly separated by a narrow space whenever the primary ligament is not preserved. In error, Hind (1900, p. 442) referred to the space as a “slit for the ligament.” Herein termed the internymphal gap (Figure 1B, Figure 3A-E, ig), it is a character seen in living and fossil Acharax but not in Solemya. In his original diagnosis Dall (1908, p. 2) referred to it thusly: “Ligament opisthodetic, wholly external, visible internally only where it crosses the gap between the margins of the valves.” In Acharax, the internymphal gap is covered in life by the arch of the external ligament and is thereby visible only when the ligament is not preserved. In contrast, the internymphal gap is missing in Solemya because the nymphae are submarginal and the former gap is secondarily covered over by the aforementioned outer prismatic shell layer (Figure 1D-E, opl). In addition to Acharax, the internymphal gap (a probable symplesiomorphy) is observed in other fossil solemyid genera with external nymphae including both Clinopistha Meek and Worthen, 1870, and Dystactella Hall and Whitfield, 1872.\n\nSolemyid Origins and Phylogeny\n\nParivincular ligaments with supporting nymphae are key characters used in Pojeta’s (1988) proposed phylogeny of fossil and extant Solemyidae (Figure 4A). Pojeta (1988) and Waller (1990, 1998) posited that these characters were acquired from nymph-bearing ctenodontid nuculoid ancestors such as Ctenodonta nasuta (Hall, 1847) and, especially, Ctenodonta tennesseensis Pojeta, 1988, which, aside from the taxondont hinge, is strikingly similar to the early solemyid Dystactella Hall and Whitfield, 1872. Strong phylogenetic connections of the solemyids and nuculoids are supported by numerous other studies (e.g., Carter et al., 2000; Carter, 2001; Giribet and Distel, 2003; Giribet, 2008; Bailey, 2011; Carter et al., 2011; Bieler et al., 2014). However, based on stratigraphic occurrences Cope (2002) suggested that these characters might have arisen independently in the two groups. Whereas the solemyid Ovatoconcha is dated as late Early Ordovician, ligamental nymphae do not occur in ctenodontids until the Middle Ordovician. Alternatively, Cope also posited that nymphae could be persistent characters derived from earlier, as yet undocumented ctenodontid stock. Indeed, persistent solemyid traits are fairly common among much later nuculoids, for example, in Spathelopsis oakvalensis Peck, Bailey, Heck, and Scaiff, 2009 from the Mississippian of West Virginia (see Peck et al., 2009, p. 959; Bailey, 2011, p. 14).\n\nPojeta’s (1988, fig. 3) phyletic scheme divided the Solemyidae into two sister subfamilies, the Clinopisthinae and the Solemyinae (Figure 4A). With the exception of Solemya, external placement of the nymphae and ligament is broadly shared in both subfamilies. Among the Solemyinae it occurs in Psiloconcha Ulrich, 1894 (Ordovician), Acharax (Devonian-Holocene), and Mazonomya Bailey, 2011 (Pennsylvanian). Among the Clinopisthinae, it occurs in Clinopistha Meek and Worthen, 1870 (Devonian-Permian) and Dystactella Hall and Whitfield, 1872 (Ordovician-Permian). Thus, it is likely to represent the primitive (symplesiomorphic) condition for the Solemyidae as a whole. In contrast, the submarginal ligament structure of Solemya is unique, representing a derived (autapomorphic) condition evidently not occurring prior to the Mesozoic (Figure 4B). Although ligament and nymphae are as yet unknown in Ovatoconcha, the genus is a near match for its possible congener, Psiloconcha with respect to: 1) shell profile, aspect ratio and shell gapes; 2) umbonal placement and elevation; 3) small size and high placement of the posterior adductors to accommodate the underlying hypertrophied gills and hypobranchial gland; and 4) pyriform outline and elevated placement of the anterior composite (adductor/visceral retractor) scars (Bailey, 2011, p. 12). Radial elements in the prosopon are not well developed in either genus, i.e., weak in Ovatoconcha and mostly lacking in Psiloconcha.\n\nThe Problem of Range\n\nIn order to establish a convincing phylogenetic derivation of Solemya from Acharax ancestry, the geologic timing of the split must be consistent with the foregoing character analysis.\n\nThe Y-shaped burrows of the ichnogenus Solemyatuba Seilacher, 1990 occur as early as the Ordovician (Seilacher, 1990). Although they are usually attributed to Solemya, comparable burrows are also associated with Acharax (Stanley, 1970, Campbell et al., 2006; Ros-Franch et al., 2014). Thus, their occurrence cannot be attributed to a particular genus.\n\nEarly authors, including Beushausen (1895), Zittel (1913), Quenstedt (1930), Shimer and Shrock (1944), as well as more recent authors, notably Cox (1969), gave the stratigraphic range of Solemya as Devonian-Holocene under the apparent misapprehension that the submarginal ligament and compound buttress were primitive characters, whereas the external ligament and simple buttress of Acharax were tacitly regarded as later derivations. For example, Cox (1969) regarded Acharax as a later genus with a verified range limited to Miocene-Holocene. However, Pojeta (1988) subsequently emended the range of each genus thusly: For Solemya, Upper Pennsylvanian-Holocene; and for Acharax, Lower Permian-Holocene, (with a dubious Middle Devonian occurrence). Pojeta’s basis for concluding that Solemya occurred as early as the Upper Pennsylvanian was a single specimen, “Solemya sp.” (USNM 415967), from the Hertha Limestone, Erie, Kansas (Pojeta, 1988, pl. 23, figs. 5-8). However, this specimen is a probable Acharax because the alleged free ends of the “chondrophores” shown in his figure 8 are probably the compressed and broken termini of external nymphae, a conclusion supported by his figure 5 of the same specimen showing: 1) simple buttresses that dorsally reveal no indication of either added reinforcement or attachment to internal nymphae; and 2) posterior adductor scars that are entire, lacking the expected dorsal occlusion caused by submarginal nymphae.\n\nAlthough the study of Dickins (1963), like that of Pojeta (1988), ostensibly provided support for the late Paleozoic occurrence of Solemya, Dickins himself was tentative regarding the final generic assignment of his material. His “Solemya” holmwoodensis Dickins (1963) from the Lower Permian of western Australia is herein assigned to Acharax inasmuch as the holotype and three paratypes show strong external nymphae as well as the anterior ligamental extension (Dickins, 1963, p. 60; pl. 7, figs. 1-9). Even a dorsally arched portion of the external parivincular ligament is preserved in the holotype (Dickins, 1963, pl. 7, fig. 2). In error, Hajkr et al. (1978, p. 14) transferred this species to the Sanguinolitidae Miller, 1877.\n\nContemporary studies support the view that Acharax arose much earlier than Cox (1969) had supposed. For example, Acharax has been reported from the Early Devonian of Arctic Canada (Bailey, 2011, 2016; Bailey and Prosh, 2016). In addition, there are Pennsylvanian occurrences in both Kentucky (Carter, 1990) and the Mazon Creek Lagerstätte of Illinois (Bailey, 2011). Furthermore, all of the Devonian-Permian examples of alleged Solemya (and its doppelgänger, Janeia King, 1850) reviewed herein have external ligament and nymphae like Acharax, whereas the submarginal ligament and associated compounding of the buttress of Solemya appear to be Mesozoic modifications (see Appendix; also Bailey, 2011, 2016).\n\nUnverified examples of Solemya have been reported from the Permian (Ciriacks, 1963; Sterren and Cisterna, 2010) and Triassic (Conrad, 1870). Ciriacks (1963, p. 42, pl. 5, figs.12, 13) tentatively designated a nearly featureless internal mold of a possible solemyid as Solemya sp. (UM 5275 = “S. radiata?” sensu Branson, 1930) from the Park City Formation, near Cody, Wyoming. Although Ciriacks (p. 42) described the specimen as “insufficiently preserved for specific identification”, the form superficially resembles Dystactella. Sterren and Cisterna (2010, p. vi) reported an occurrence of Solemya from the Early Permian of Argentina, but they provided neither figure nor description. Conrad (1870, p. 102) described the shell exterior and radial prosopon of “an obscure cast” he designated Solemya triasina Conrad, 1870, from the Triassic of Perkiomen Creek, Pennsylvania. However, data on the hinge and ligament are lacking, and no figure of the specimen, now lost, was provided.\n\nOther studies place the earliest occurrence of Solemya in either the Jurassic (Coan et al., 2000; Imhoff et al., 2003; Neulinger et al., 2006) or Cretaceous (Dechaseaux, 1952). Hryniewicz et al. (2014) reported convincing examples of Solemya from Late Jurassic-Early Cretaceous hydrocarbon seeps of Spitzbergen. The silicon rubber casts of their (fig. 3h-i) internal molds of Solemya (Petrasma) cf. woodwardiana Leckenby, 1859 clearly show the compound buttress and occluded posterior adductor scar. It should be noted, however, that alleged “Solemya woodwardiana” reported by Duff (1978) from the Lower Oxford Clay (Middle Jurassic of England) is a possible Acharax. Although data on the posterior adductor is lacking, a simple buttress is evident. In addition, the butterflied specimen figured by Duff (1978, pl. 1, fig. 40) shows what appear to be traces of a deltoid parivincular ligament stretching across an internymphal gap with a possible nymph and insertion groove preserved in the right valve.\n\nThe accumulation of 18S rRNA gene sequence disparities (Neulinger et al., 2006) separating extant species of Acharax and Solemya seem consistent with a Mesozoic (possibly Jurassic) split. The timing of the split is interesting. Among the Bivalvia in general, the Mesozoic is associated with episodes of rapid expansion and diversification (Ros et al., 2012).\n\nTaxonomic Dissent\n\nDespite extensive study, solemyoid classification remains in dispute, noticeably in regard to the systematic relations of Solemya and Acharax (Table 1). Owing to the external ligament, Cox (1969) in Part N of the Treatise first elevated Solemya (Acharax) Dall from subgeneric to full generic status while adding, in error, the vesicomyid, Adulomya Kuroda, 1931 (i.e., see Amano and Kiel, 2011) to the Solemyidae and, unfortunately, giving full recognition to the problematic Janeia King, 1850 as a subgenus of Solemya.\n\nBased on the ontogenetic expansion vector of the shell and underlying soft anatomy, Pojeta’s (1988) landmark study argued for two main phyletic lines (Figure 4A) within the Solemyidae, thereby subdividing the Solemyidae into two subfamilies: 1) the Solemyinae for anteriorly elongated solemyids with “barely discernible” beaks and umbos (i.e., Solemya, Acharax, and Psiloconcha); and 2) the Clinopisthinae for anteroventrally elongated solemyids with more conspicuous umbos and beaks (i.e., Clinopistha and Dystactella). This system was followed by Bailey (2011) and used herein (see Figure 4B, Table 1 and Appendix).\n\nScarlato and Starobogatov (1979) split the order Solemyoida into two suborders, the Nucinellina and Solemyina. Emphasizing the relative significance of the submarginal vs. external ligament, they divided the Solemyina into two taxonomic divisions: 1) the Superfamily Solemyoidea/Family Solemyidae was proposed for genera with submarginal ligaments such as Solemya; and 2) the Superfamily Acharacoidea/Family Acharachidae was proposed for genera with an external ligament, including Acharax and, in error, the vesicomyid Adulomya (see Amano and Kiel, 2011). A similarly divided system was endorsed by Zardus (2002), Nevesskaja (2009), and Nevesskaja et al. (2013).\n\nMaxwell (1988) likewise placed Acharax and Solemya in separate superfamilies, the Acharacoidea and Solemyoidea, respectively, whereas Amler (1999) recognized only one superfamily, the Solemyoidea made up of three families, the Solemyidae, the Janacekiidae, and the Acharacidae.\n\nBieler et al. (2010) combined and modified the classifications of both Pojeta (1988) and Scarlato and Starobogatov (1979) by dividing the Solemyidae into three subfamilies, the Clinopisthinae, the Acharacinae, and the Solemyinae, the latter considered as a synonym of the Janacekiidae Růžička and Řehoř 1978. However, this system is problematic in that it results in the division of the Acharax-Solemya clade into two paraphyletic subgroups. Furthermore, treating the Janacekiidae as a synonym of the Solemyinae is antithetical because the namesake, Janacekia Růžička and Řehoř, 1978, has the external ligament and nymphae like Acharax but unlike Solemya, as discussed further below.\n\nCarter et al. (2011) proposed dividing the order Solemyida into two superfamilies, the Solemyoidea and the Manzanelloidea. In this system, the Solemyoidea comprises four families: the Solemyidae, consisting of the subfamilies Solemyinae (containing both Acharax and Solemya), as well as the Janacekiinae, Clinopisthidae, Ctenodontidae, and Ovatoconchidae. However, because Janacekia is herein accepted as a junior synonym of Acharax, the Janacekiinae becomes superfluous. In addition, Ovatoconcha, because of its similarities to Psiloconcha, may arguably be placed in the Solemyinae.\n\nIf, indeed, as posited herein, Solemya was derived from Acharax ancestors by, perhaps, mid-Mesozoic times through depression of the primary ligament and nymphae to a submarginal position, the two genera are monophyletic, a conclusion independently corroborated by both Sharma et al. (2013) and Combosch et al. (2017) in each of their phylogenetic tests of molecular markers in the genomic DNA of Solemya and Acharax. The 18S rRNA analysis of these genera by Taylor et al. (2008) reached a similar conclusion. According to Mayr and Ashlock (1991) higher taxa should consist of monophyletic groups separated from groups of similar rank by a distinctive gap. Their understanding echoes Schenck’s (1934, p. 55) classic criterion: “One basic principle is that a family should be monophyletic.” When inherent misunderstandings associated with Janeia and Janacekia are eliminated, the morphologic and temporal gaps separating Acharax and Solemya are not only minimized, but also consistent with DNA studies. Thus, of the various systems described above, Pojeta’s (1988) taxonomic scheme combining both genera within a single subfamily (Solemyinae) remains a viable alternative to placement into separate (paraphyletic) superfamilies or families.\n\nTHE JANEIA PROBLEM\n\nKey issues influencing the taxonomic debate are historical interpretations (sometimes incomplete or erroneous) of past authors regarding the placement of the primary ligament and its associated structures, specifically, the mistaken assumption that among Paleozoic Solemyidae, the primary ligament was placed internally, supported there by so-called “chondrophores” as in modern Solemya. This assumption has been largely based on a series of misapprehensions regarding a single illusory genus, Janeia.\n\nIn Search of a Concept\n\nJaneia King (1850) may be justifiably regarded as a nomen dubium (Hryniewicz et al., 2017). Commenting on its ill-defined and confusing history, Pojeta (1988, p. 214) called it “a name looking for a concept.” Nevertheless, Janeia continues to be widely applied in recent publications (e.g., Nevesskaja, et al., 2013) and many online databases, even though it is devoid of any essential meaning. Historically, the ongoing confusion began with King (1850) himself. In his celebrated monograph, The Permian Fossils of England, he first proposed the genus on page 177 of the text, but subsequently withdrew it in an appendix note (p. 246-247) of the same publication, concluding that Janeia and Solemya are synonymous. In addition, King’s original diagnosis of Janeia is both ambiguous and inaccurate, reflecting not only a misunderstanding of the fossil material at hand but also a lack of familiarity with solemyid soft anatomy. In his diagnosis the anterior and posterior ends of the shell were reversed, and he mischaracterized the ligament (i.e., “cartilage”) as “internal; attached to a considerable portion of, and a little within, the dorsal margin of the valves; dilated, and somewhat oval within the umbonal cavity; narrow and elongated behind [sic] it” (King, 1850, p. 177). The “considerable” dorsal attachment of the ligament possibly refers only to the secondary ligament, that is, the anterior extension of the ligament outer layer (seen in both Acharax and Solemya) that runs along much of the anterodorsal (longidorsal) length of the valves. The “somewhat oval” portion is more difficult to interpret; perhaps it refers to the variably developed subumbonal ligamental demipads seen in Solemya and some Acharax (see Bailey, 2011).\n\nKing (1850, p. 247) reported that his withdrawal of Janeia was based on an evaluation of the anatomical and conchological figures of Solemya mediterranea Lamarck, 1818, as contained in Cuvier (1836, plate 115). Curiously, despite anatomical evidence to the contrary, King (1850, p. 247) persisted in his erroneous interpretation of shell orientation and criticized contemporary conchologists who disagreed. Despite King’s withdrawal of Janeia, the name has had a lasting legacy inasmuch as it has been accepted by many subsequent authors who, in an attempt to salvage the concept, have ascribed to it additional characters far beyond those originally intended by King.\n\nHistorically, Janeia has been conceptually applied to Paleozoic solemyids having an internal (primary) ligament supported by internal “chondrophores” (= nymphae) as in extant Solemya. It must be emphasized that the nature of the primary ligament in Janeia is purely an unsupported assumption based on: 1) King’s (1850, p. 177) mischaracterization of the ligament as internal; and 2) his subsequent conflation of Janeia with extant Solemya. Inasmuch as the name Janeia has been restricted to Paleozoic solemyids, the internal primary ligament has been accordingly presumed to be a primitive (plesiomorphic) character within the Solemyidae, whereas the external ligament in Acharax, is implicitly understood to be a post-Paleozoic derived (apomorphic) condition. However, evidence suggests the opposite to be true, given the many published examples of Janeia showing evidence of an external primary ligament similar to Acharax (see Logan, 1967; Carter, 1990; Dickins, 1999; Bailey, 2011, and Appendix herein), whereas other examples of putative Janeia with external ligaments are assignable to either Dystactella or Clinopistha.\n\nTypes and Archetypes\n\nEach of the species of Janeia originally proposed by King is evaluated below:\n\nJaneia primaeva (Phillips, 1836). Logan’s (1967) restudy of Janeia primaeva accepted the primary ligament as external, a conclusion later confirmed by Bailey (2011) who emended the name as Acharax primaeva (Phillips, 1836) (see Appendix).\n\nAs type species of Janeia, King (1850) selected Solemya primaeva Phillips, 1836 from the Lower Carboniferous (Tournaisian-Viséan) of Lowick, Northumberland, England (see Figure 5A), but he neither discussed it nor its relationship to his two other exemplars, Janeia biarmica (de Verneuil, 1845) from the Upper Permian Magnesian Limestone at Tunstall Hill and Humbledon Hill, Durham, England, and Janeia phillipsiana (King, 1848), allegedly from Humbledon Hill.\n\nSolemya primaeva was evidently based on a single specimen. Phillips’ (1836, p. 209, pl. 5, fig. 6) original treatment consists of an imprecise diagnosis and simple drawing. The putative holotype consisted of a composite mold with attached shell showing no evidence of the ligamental condition aside from the apparent non-occlusion of the posterior adductor scar, suggestive of an external ligament as in Acharax (Figure 5A). The specimen, originally stored in Phillips’ personal collection, is lost, allegedly stolen by thieves (see Hind, 1896 footnote, p. 19). Portlock’s (1843, p. 441) subsequent re-description S. primaeva was based on a single unfigured hypotype collected from an alternate location, i.e., Carboniferous shales of Aghaloo Parish, County Tyrone, Northern Ireland. Portlock’s hypotype, much larger and more elongated than Phillips’ holotype, was later illustrated by Hind (1900) (see Figure 5B). In the same study, Hind illustrated five additional specimens of S. primaeva (e.g., Figure 5C-D). One of these, a topotype (Figure 5C), was reproduced by Cox (1969, fig. B1.1a) in Part N of the Treatise where it was used as a principal basis for accepting Janeia as a valid subgenus. Unfortunately, the Treatise figure is mistakenly credited to Phillips (1836) rather than Hind (1900). Apart from the significant size disparity, the morphologic similarities of Hind’s topotypic example (Figure 5C) and Portlock’s hypotype (Figure 5B) are compelling. Both lack direct ligament data but show simple buttresses and entire posterior adductors characteristic of Acharax.\n\nM’Coy (1855) approved of King’s decision to withdraw Janeia in favor of Solemya in apparent agreement with King’s presumption that the primary ligament is internal. However, he disagreed with King on shell orientation, asserting correctly that the valves are anteriorly elongate. On page 519 of the same work M’Coy provided a detailed description of an additional topotype he identified as Solemya primaeva Phillips, although the shell shape significantly differs from the aforementioned specimens of Hind. As shown in Figure 5E-F, it appears to be either an internal or composite mold with well-marked adductor scars and radial striae. As in Acharax, the posterior adductor scar is entire, and the internal buttress is weak and simple, extending along the anterior border of the posterior adductor and diminishing in relief as it approaches the interior of the umbo. The close-set nymphae shown on the brevidorsum appear to be external, recalling those of Acharax (Nacrosolemya) trapezoides (Meek, 1874) (see Beede and Rogers 1899, pl. 32, fig. 2b; Carter, 1990, fig. 17d), an interpretation that seems supported by M’Coy’s own description (1855, p. 519): “...on its outer or posterior margin the slight thickening of the external cartilage support [= nymphae] is clearly seen, and the reflected gaping [= internymphal gap] edge of the lunette in some specimens...” Surprisingly, these features are not validated by M’Coy’s actual topotype (Sedgwick Museum, no. E1114), a natural cast with attached matrix (Figure 5G-H) on which his illustrations (evidently interpretive reconstructions) were based. In particular, the hinge morphology of the topotype is inconsistent with M’Coy’s figure, providing few clues concerning the exact mode of ligament attachment. Yet, the posterior adductor is simple, and the elevated brevidorsal feature that M’Coy called a “lunette” (p. 519) appears consistent with external nymphae. It is worth noting here that Hind (1900, p. 444) regarded M’Coy’s figures as “largely hypothetical, especially the view of the hinge-line and umbones.”\n\nSolemyids comparable to S. primaeva have been treated by several authors. De Verneuil’s (1845, pl. 19, fig. 5) specimen of S. primaeva from the Lower Permian of Russia is fragmentary; only the anterior portion of the shell is preserved; the ligament-bearing posterior portion of shell is missing. Both M’Coy (1855 p. 520) and Hind (1900, p. 440) accepted Solemya puzosiana de Koninck, 1842, Carboniferous of Belgium (Figure 3B-E), as a synonym of S. primaeva. However, M’Coy (1855) separated the species into two varieties: S. primaeva of Phillips he informally called S. primaeva var. α whereas Solemya puzosiana de Koninck, 1842 (p. 60, pl. 5, fig. 2a, b; Carboniferous of Belgium) he formally named S. primaeva var. β. Similar shells, M’Coy noted, occur in the Lower Carboniferous dark limestone of Lowick and black beds of Derbyshire.\n\nZhang and Pojeta (1986, p. 670, fig. 5.4) reported Solemya (Janeia) primaeva (Phillips) from the Ceshui Formation (Lower Carboniferous of China). Their specimen resembles Hind’s (1900) topotype and Portlock’s hypotype (Figure 5B).\n\nJaneia biarmica (de Verneuil, 1845). King's (1850, pl. 16, fig. 7) example of J. biarmica from the Upper Permian, Tunstall Hill, and Humbledon Quarry, is not a solemyid (Figure 5I). The umbos are too prominent, and the shell is marked by regular, broadly rounded comarginal ribs (radii lacking), and a subtruncate longiterminus. Rather, it is a probable pholadomyoid, i.e., Wilkingia elegans (King) (see Logan, 1967, p. 63). Richard Howse (1857a, p. 309), a colleague and collaborator of King’s, called it a juvenile specimen of Allorisma elegans [= Wilkingia elegans ], and Geinitz (1861, p. 57) agreed.\n\nKing (1850, p. 178) placed Solemya abnormis Howse, 1848 from the Upper Magnesian Limestone (Upper Permian), Tunstall and Silksworth, in synonymy with J. biarmica. Howse (1857a, p. 309) not only disagreed with King’s conclusion but also professed reluctance in referring it to Solemya. His two figures of S. abnormis (Howse, 1857a, pl. 4, figs. 8, 9) are simple drawings. Although the ambiguous shell fragment in his figure 9 shows no distinguishing traits, the modioliform Silksworth shell shown in his figure 8 (Figure 5J herein) compares with Stutchburia modioliformis (King) sensu Logan (1967, p. 50, pl. 8, fig. 8a-e) from the reef facies, Middle Magnesian Limestone (Upper Permian), Tunstall Hill, Durham. Later, Howse (1858, p. 266, pl. 11, figs. 8, 9) published the same Silksworth shell under the name of “Solemya biarmica?” (see Appendix).\n\nDe Verneuil’s (1845, pl. 19, fig. 4a, b) original specimen of Solemya biarmica, herein assigned to the clinopisthin, Dystactella, is a smooth internal mold from the Lower Permian of Nizhny Novgorod Oblast (Russia) (see Figure 5K-L). Unlike Acharax and Solemya, the umbos are broader, more elevated and more subcentrally placed than in either of these genera, and the shell is expanded anteroventrally. Furthermore, the shell radii that often mark internal molds of both Solemya and Acharax are uncharacteristically absent. The thin cylindrical ridge along the brevidorsum is probably a sediment infilling of an internymphal gap associated with a strong external ligament. The characters and the shell profile of de Verneuil’s figured type precisely match McAlester’s (1968, pl. 5, figs. 3-11) and Pojeta’s (1988, pl. 8, figs. 1-10) specimens of Dystactella subnasuta Hall and Whitfield, 1872 (type species of Dystactella) from the Silver Creek Limestone Member of the Sellersburg Limestone (Middle Devonian) of Clark County, Indiana. (compare Figure 5K-L with Figure 5M-N) Herein, de Verneuil’s original figured type of Solemya biarmica is emended as Dystactella biarmica (de Verneuil, 1845) new combination (see Appendix).\n\nA tiny specimen attributed to S. biarmica by Geinitz (1848, p. 8, pl. 3, fig. 34) from the Permian Kupferschiefer of Kamsdorf, Germany, is not instructive. However, a second example figured by Geinitz (1861, p. 60, pl. 12, fig. 18) superficially resembles de Verneuil’s figured type (= Dystactella), but ligamental and other data are lacking. Logan’s (1967, pl. 10, fig. 11, 12) figured specimens, hypotypes “A” and “B” respectively, from the Upper Permian Middle Magnesian Limestone, Durham, were described under the emended name, Janeia biarmica (de Verneuil, 1845). Hypotype “A”, from Humbledon Hill, is an internal mold that generally agrees with de Verneuil’s type. However, Logan’s inferred profile of the incomplete hypotype “B” from Tunstall Hill is more like Acharax although the prosoponal radii characteristic of some (but not all) species of this genus are not evident. Unlike de Verneuil’s figured type, hypotype “B” is far more inequiaxal with lower umbos. Significantly, it convincingly shows remains of paired external ligamental nymphae separated by a narrow oval cleft (internymphal gap), features associated with both Acharax and Dystactella but not Solemya.\n\nJaneia phillipsiana (King, 1848). King’s figure (1850, pl. 16, fig. 8) shows an internal mold, extremely inequiaxial in form, with barely discernible umbo and beak. A few radial ribs are indistinctly shown along with a narrow furrow for a simple buttress extending vertically to the beak but lacking an adjoining groove for the diagnostic submarginal nymph of Solemya (see Figure 5O). Significantly, in a scathing denunciation of King’s work, Howse (1857b, p. 9) accused King of specimen theft, plagiarism, and deceit, calling King’s Janeia phillipsiana a “mere fiction”, and asserting that his published description and figure were inventions based on non-existent fossil material. Accordingly, King’s (1850, p. 179) placement of Solemya normalis Howse, 1848 in synonymy with J. phillipsiana was also denounced by Howse (1857a, p. 309; 1857b, p. 9; 1858, p. 266).\n\nHowse’s (1857a, pl. 4, fig. 7; 1858, pl. 11, fig. 7) own illustration of S. normalis is a simple drawing of an elongated shell with low umbos marked by comarginal lineations with few radii and, apparently, an entire posterior adductor scar (see Figure 5P). However, the shell is unusual in its slightly arcuate profile and broadly embayed ventral margin. In a footnote, Howse (1857a, p. 308; 1858, p. 265) admitted that anterior extremity of his drawing was not correctly represented. Thereby, placement within the Solemyidae cannot be fully confirmed. More recently, Logan (1967, p. 61) gave recognition to Janeia normalis (Howse) based on material from the Upper Permian Magnesian Limestone at Tunstall Hill. However, these are referable to Acharax inasmuch as Logan (p. 62) observed external ligamental nymphae in his hypotypes. Although prosoponal radii are either weak or lacking, the shell profiles (see Logan, 1967, pl. 10, figs. 13, 14) are intermediate between Solemya parallela Beede and Rogers, 1899, pl. 34, fig. 1 (= Acharax parallela (Beede and Rogers) emend. Bailey, 2011) and Acharax primaeva (i.e., S. primaeva sensu Hind, 1900, non Phillips, 1836).\n\nFrom the lower Zechstein (Upper Permian) of Germany, Schauroth (1854, p. 553, pl. 21, fig. 5) described a specimen he hesitatingly referred to Solemya phillipsiana (King). His figure shows a relatively featureless internal mold with an anomalously thick shell remnant attached just above the “posterior” (breviventral) margin (Figure 5Q). The shape of the bivalve superficially agrees with other solemyins and is subtly marked by a few radial elements. Subsequently, Geinitz (1861, p. 60, pl. 12, fig. 19) refigured Schauroth’s original specimen but assigned it to Solemya biarmica de Verneuil, although the similarities to that species are few. Interestingly, Geinitz’s figure of the same specimen is startlingly different from Schauroth’s. Although Geinitz’s figure, like that of Schauroth, shows the same telltale shell remnant, the overall profile of the bivalve is noticeably altered (see Figure 5R). More significantly, the internal mold in Geinitz’s figure is marked by a deep groove for an internal buttress flanked by an adductor scar. Surprisingly, these features are altogether missing in Schauroth’s figure. If Geinitz’s illustration is accurate, the septum-like buttress is simple but appears unusually deep and well defined but does not appear to directly border the adductor scar as expected. The adductor scar, though entire, is unusual in its more breviventral placement. Although the shell profile superficially recalls Acharax parallela (Beede and Rogers), the umbos are more prominent and less extreme in posterior placement, and strong comarginal lirae adventitiously mark the outer surface of the shell remnant. Because of the many disparities, taxonomic placement of this specimen is undetermined, and its location is unknown.\n\nA PERPLEXING LEGACY\n\nJaneia Reinvented\n\nDespite King’s own abandonment of Janeia and Howse’s recriminations, subsequent authors found various problematic reasons for reinstating the name. Fielding Bradford Meek (in Meek and Worthen, 1870, p. 44) suggested reviving Janeia as a subgenus of Solemya for Carboniferous-Permian shells similar to those of King (1850) but showing left-over-right overlap of the beaks. Meek speculated that King’s failure to mention overlap in his original diagnosis of Janeia may have been due to an insufficiency in available material. In 1871, Meek (p. 66) described Solemya (Janeia) vetusta from the Corniferous Limestone (Devonian), Franklin Co., Ohio, and published a figure of it two years later (Meek, 1873, pl. 18, fig. 4). The distinctive shell (Figure 6A) shows the marked anteroventral expansion vector and prominent external ligament seen in the Clinopisthinae (i.e., Clinopistha and Dystactella). The similarities to Dystactella valvulus (Hall and Whitfield, 1872) from the Middle Devonian (Silver Creek Limestone Member, Sellersburg Limestone) of Indiana are fairly strong although Pojeta (1988, p. 217) rejected conspecificity (but compare with Pojeta, 1988, pl. 10, fig. 1). The low, subcentrally placed umbos, long, low-angled posterodorsal slope, weakly developed radii, and narrow posterior adductor bordered by a thin, weak buttress led Meek to compare it to Solemya biarmica de Verneuil, suggesting that King’s abandoned genus, Janeia, should perhaps be reinstated and applied to solemyids with similar characters. James Hall (1885) followed Meek’s precedent; his specimens of Solemya (Janeia) vetusta from the Middle Devonian Hamilton Group, near Louisville, Kentucky and Charlestown, Indiana, superficially agree with Meek’s material (Figure 6B-D). Pojeta (1988, p. 217) placed all of Hall’s figured specimens of Solemya (Janeia) vetusta in Dystactella valvulus. All of Hall’s (1885) figured specimens show evidence of an external ligament in the form of narrow ridges (= external nymphae) along the brevidorsum. In particular, the uniquely scalloped radial elements in the prosopon (Figure 6E) shown in one of Hall’s S. (J.) vetusta exactly match those of D. valvulus illustrated by Pojeta (1988, pl. 10, fig. 1). Kindle’s (1901) figures show similarities (Figure 6F-G). In addition, the paired external nymphae (Figure 6G, ne) are visibly separated by a narrow internymphal gap (Figure 6G, ig). All aforementioned biarmica-vetusta specimens of de Verneuil (1845), Meek (1873), Hall (1885), and Kindle (1901) are herein reassigned to Dystactella (see Appendix). Compare with figured specimens of McAlester (1968, pl. 5, figs. 1-11) and Pojeta (1988, pls. 6-10).\n\nValve Inequality and Overlap\n\nIn Dechaseaux’s (1952, p. 264) treatment of solemyid genera, Janeia is given a range of Devonian-Permian and distinguished from Solemya only by being “légèrement inéquivalve.” The roots of this problematic trait are traceable not only to Meek (p. 44 in Meek and Worthen, 1870; Meek, 1876, p. 127) but also to Beushausen (1895, p. 292). Both authors stressed the need for full reinstatement of Janeia in application to Paleozoic specimens similar to Solemya but showing a slight umbonal overlap (often left-over-right) of the opposing valves. However, Beushausen’s (1895) emphasis on valve asymmetry in diagnosing Janeia must be seen within the larger context of his erroneous belief that, in general, valve inequality and overlap were natural characteristics of most Paleozoic bivalves.\n\nBailey (1983, figs. 34, 35, and p. 280) documented minor left-right inequalities in non-solemyoid protobranchs, for example, left-right valve height and depth inequalities in the Nuculidae (i.e., Nuculoidea deceptriformis Bailey, 1983) and left-right ligamental inequalities in the Malletiidae, i.e., Palaeoneilo filosa (Conrad, 1842). Among the Solemyidae, Bailey (2011) showed that valve overlap and inequality (including ligament lateralization) are common among the Solemyidae and by no means restricted to species referred to Janeia. Růžička and Řehoř (1978) likewise reported umbonal overlap in their Carboniferous genus, Janacekia, although it is a persistent character among the Solemyidae described as early as the Silurian (i.e., Janeia silurica Liljeldahl, 1984). Meek (1873) reported it in Devonian Clinopistha. It has also been observed in an undescribed species of Early Devonian Acharax (Bailey, 2011; Bailey and Prosh, 2016), as well as two common Pennsylvanian species, Acharax (Nacrosolemya) trapezoides (Meek, 1874) and Acharax radiata (Meek and Worthen, 1860) (see Carter, 1990; Bailey, 2011, text-fig. 4.2). In addition, it also occurs in extant Solemya, notably, Solemya (Zesolemya) parkinsoni Smith, 1874, and Solemya (Austrosolemya) australis Lamarck, 1818 (Carter, 1990; Carter et al., 1990; Bailey 2011).\n\nPossible causes of the overlap summarized by Bailey (2011) include: 1) cracking and repair of the fragile umbonal region during growth (Waller, 1990); 2) reclining on one valve within the burrow as in extant Solemya (Petrasma) velum Say, 1822; and 3) the effects of post-mortem sedimentary compaction on the thin, pliable valves.\n\nBased upon his incorrect assumptions regarding valve inequality and overlap, Beushausen (1895, p. 290) placed Paleozoic so-called “Solemya” of previous authors in Janeia. In addition, he expanded and shaped his understanding of Janeia to include both Dystactella and Clinopistha. As Beushausen admitted on page 294: “Eine generische Verschiedenheit von Clinopistha und Janeia kann ich jedenfalls nicht anerkennen.” As exemplars of his broad vision of Janeia, he chose four species from the Devonian of the Rhineland previously placed by Goldfuss (1840) in Sanguinolaria Lamarck, 1799. Each of these is evaluated below:\n\nJaneia? compressa (Goldfuss, 1840). Beushausen’s placement of this species in Janeia was tentative. Neither his designated type (Sanguinolaria compressa Goldfuss, 1840, p. 280, pl. 159, fig. 16a-b) nor his figured specimen (Figure 6H-J) is a solemyid. Both are somewhat modioloid in form with a laterally compressed shell (height/total width = 1.73). Alternatively, both favorably compare with published examples of Pleurophorella Girty, 1904, e.g., Pleurophorella transversa (de Koninck, 1842) (see Morris et al., 1991, fig. 41) from the Lower Carboniferous of Tournai, Belgium (see Appendix). Although the hinge, ligament and internal morphology of Janeia? compressa are unknown, the dorsal views of both Goldfuss’ shell and Figure 6J are similar. Each is posteriorly elongate with a well-defined lunule and escutcheon.\n\nJaneia laevigata (Goldfuss, 1840). Beushausen described neither the hinge nor internal characters. His first example (Figure 6K-L) favorably compares with Sanguinolites striatograunulatus Hind, 1900 (p. 393, pl. 42, figs. 6-22). Though superficially resembling a solemyid in profile and prosponal radii, it is posteriorly elongate. Like Acharax, it has an internal buttress, but here it is shorter and posteriorly borders a well-marked anterior adductor. Based on their restudy of Hind’s syntypes from the Lower Carboniferous of the Isle of Man and Yorkshire, Morris, et al. (1991, p. 87, fig. 38c-h) judged S. striatogranulatus to be a likely synonym of Pleurophorella tricostata (Portlock, 1843). Beushausen’s second example (Figure 6M), his designated type of Janeia laevigata, is a copy of Sanguinolaria laevigata Goldfuss, 1840, p. 279, pl. 159, fig. 14. However, because much of it is embedded in sedimentary matrix, the generic identity of the type is indeterminate. His third example (Figure 6N-P) compares in profile to the following: 1) ? Pleurophorella cuneata (Phillips,1836) (Morris et al., 1991, p. 88, fig. 42) from the Lower Carboniferous, Bolland, Yorkshire; 2) Pleurophorella sp. from the Upper Pennsylvanian of Texas (Morris et al., 1991, fig. 40), and 3) Pleurophorella ? sp. from the Pennsylvanian of Brazil (Anelli et al., 2009, fig. 2H). The laterally compressed shell (dorsal view, Figure 6P), and well-marked lunule and escutcheon, are notably similar to Beushausen’s Janeia? compressa (dorsal view, Figure 6J).\n\nJaneia truncata (Goldfuss, 1840). Two of the figured specimens of J. truncata on Beushausen’s (1895) plate 26 are solemyids (i.e., clinopisthins), probably Clinopistha Meek and Worthen (see Figure 6Q-T) although the ligament is not preserved. Beushausen (1895, p. 297) compared J. truncata to Janeia (Solemya) vetusta (= Dystactella valvulus sensu Pojeta, 1988, non Meek, 1871), whereas Hind (1900) compared it to Clinopistha. However, one of Beushausen’s examples of alleged J. truncata is problematic (Figure 6U-V). The pallial line (pl) is far too distinct for a solemyid (see Cox, 1969, p. N241). In addition, the well-delimited circular profile of the “anterior” adductor scar (ad) suggests a discrete muscular unit, whereas among the Solemyidae it is typically a pyriform composite scar formed by the contiguous placement of the anterior adductor muscle and the visceral/pedal retractor and protractor muscle complex (Bailey, 2011, p. 12). Cox (1969, p. N242) considered the composite anterior scar to be a distinctive feature of the Solemyidae.\n\nJaneia phaseolina (Goldfuss, 1840). The figured specimens of J. phaseolina on Beushausen’s (1895) plate 26 appear to be a heterogeneous mix of bivalves none of which are solemyids (see Appendix). Goldfuss’s type, Sanguinolaria phaseolina Goldfuss, 1840 (see Figure 6W) is generically indeterminate (possible edmondiid?), whereas two of Beushausen’s shells (Figure 6X, Y-AA) appear to be edmondiids, possibly Edmondia de Koninck, 1841 (see remarks of Hind, 1900, p. 297). A third specimen (Figure 6BB), is substantially different from the others. Although the hinge and ligamental attachment are not shown, the short, sulcate shell with tumid umbo recalls certain sanguinolitids, possibly Myofossa Waterhouse, 1969 (see Morris et al. 1991, p. 61, fig. 8).\n\nIn his celebrated monograph on Carboniferous bivalves of Great Britain and Ireland, Hind (1900) was critical of Beushausen’s (1895) reinstatement and emendation of Janeia, suggesting that the dorsal overlap emphasized by Beushausen was largely accidental due to simple displacement of the valves owing to the lack of dentition, noting similar displacement in unrelated bivalve taxa. Moreover, he observed, the left-over-right displacement, though common, was inconsistent. In many cases the displacement was the reverse, and in still other cases displacement was lacking altogether. As a result, Hind reassigned King’s type species, Janeia primaeva once again to Solemya. Although Hind did not discuss the ligament, the internal molds figured specimens in his plate 50 (Solemya primaeva Phillips, Solemya excisa de Koninck, 1885, and Solemya costellata M’Coy, 1844), the simple buttresses and entire posterior adductors favor reassignment to Acharax.\n\nThe Ligament Puzzle\n\nAs noted above, King (1850, p. 247) in his final analysis judged Janeia to be identical with Solemya. As a result, the placement of the ligament of Janeia was presumed to be internal, attached at chondrophores. However, in order to explain the external ligament preserved on some fossil specimens, de Ryckholt (1854, p. 49) surmised that, although the ligament of Solemya was attached internally, it nonetheless protruded to the outside. Of particular interest here is Beushausen’s (1895, p. 290) observation of a small opening (“schmale Oeffnung”) bordered on each side by “verdickten, schrägen Ligamentstützen” (= external nymphae) in published figures of, for example, Solemya puzosiana de Koninck (1842, pl. 5, fig. 2a, 2b; 1885, pl. 23, fig. 34) (i.e., Figure 3B-E herein). Like de Ryckholt before him, Beushausen incorrectly hypothesized the opening (= internymphal gap) to be a dorsal orifice through which King’s alleged internal ligament was permitted to protrude to the exterior. Hind (1900, p. 442) held a similar view. However, Beushausen accorded no particular taxonomic significance to this feature, noting that the opening was seen in some specimens of Janeia but not others. Among the Solemyinae, it must be again emphasized here that the presence of the internymphal gap argues for an external ligament as in Acharax. Generic placement in Solemya is thereby excluded because, as previously noted, the ligament is secondarily enclosed by an outer prismatic layer.\n\nAlthough Quenstedt (1930), a follower of Beushausen, attempted to describe and illustrate the ligament support structures of Janeia, his conclusions are unsupported. At the outset, it must be emphasized that Quenstedt, like his antecedents, began with the erroneous assumption that the ligament of Janeia, like that of Solemya, was internal. His ink drawings (Quenstedt, 1930, pl. 1, figs. 3-4) compared transverse sections through the beaks, one in extant Solemya (Zesolemya) parkinsoni Smith, 1874, and the other in a specimen Quenstedt identified as Janeia truncata (Goldfuss, 1840), from the Middle Devonian, Gerolstein, Germany. The transverse section of the internal nymph in the former appears, as expected, as a simple, recumbent, distally thickened, sublamellar plate, whereas the transverse section of the latter unexpectedly shows a robust, L-shaped ossicle (Figure 7A) alleged by Quenstedt to be a chondrophore for attachment of an internal ligament, a conclusion derided by Hajkr, et al. (1978, p. 11) as unnatural (i.e., “unnatürlich”). Although the strong angle and upright prolongation of the ossicle are generally consistent with an external nymph, the structure is so unnaturally thick and large that neither it nor the associated ligament could believably be accommodated internally if a similarly structured opposing valve (Figure 7B) were fitted into place (Figure 7C). However, if an internymphal gap is introduced between the ossicles (Figure 7D), a reasonable configuration results. Thus, the problematic ossicles take on the form and placement of paired nymphae. By implication, the restored ligament was probably external.\n\nA second problem in Quenstedt’s (1930) study is his inappropriate choice of Janeia truncata as a basis for comparison with Solemya. As noted above, J. truncata is a clinopisthin, probably Clinopistha, a genus known to have strong external ligaments and nymphae (McAlester, 1968; Pojeta, 1988). Quenstedt’s drawing of J. truncata (Figure 7E) is a reconstructed outline of the left valve of an anteriorly incomplete internal mold earlier figured by Beushausen (1895, pl. 26, fig. 5). The missing portion of the specimen was restored differently by the two authors. Judging the anterior margin to be relatively short, Beushausen’s reconstruction closely resembles Clinopistha, whereas Quenstedt’s reconstruction shows anterior elongation comparable to Dystactella. In either case, the anteroventral growth vector (sensu Pojeta, 1988) is consistent with both Dystactella and Clinopistha but dissimilar to either Acharax or Solemya.\n\nThe diagrammatic markings along the posterior margin of Quenstedt’s reconstruction were explained by Quenstedt in the explanation of his plate 1: 1) the narrow form and triangular outline of the posterior adductor is the result of perspective; 2) the vertical line running dorsally along the anterior margin of the posterior adductor represents the internal curvature of the umbo; 3) the sharp angle and short connecting line directly behind the beak corresponds to the trailing edge of the broken shell remnant and is indicative of the umbonal thickness of the shell (see Figure 7E).\n\nThe Treatise and Beyond\n\nIn Part N of the Treatise, Cox (1969, p. N242-N243) accepted Janeia as a legitimate Paleozoic subgenus of Solemya. His diagnosis (p. N243) of S. (Janeia) reads as follows: “Resembling S. (Solemya) in external features and in presence of internal chondrophore; with internal ridge [= buttress] originating at anterior end of chondrophore and diverging from it at acute angle, passing below posterior adductor scar. Dev.-Perm., cosmopolitan.” Unlike previous authors, Cox mentioned neither valve inequality nor umbonal overlap in his diagnosis. As exemplars, Cox chose a topotype of Solemya primaeva Phillips of Hind (1900) (see Figure 5C) and the transverse section of Janeia truncata (Goldfuss) of Quentstedt (1930) (see Figure 7A). Cox’s conclusions are rejected here for three reasons:\n\n1. As noted by Logan (1967), Pojeta (1988), Bailey (2011) and herein, there is no evidence as alleged that the ligament was internally placed either in the type species or, indeed, any of the other species of Janeia proposed by King (1850) or subsequent authors. Cox’s conclusion was apparently based on the L-shaped “chondrophore” in Janeia truncata figured by Quenstedt (Figure 7A). As shown above, J. truncata is a clinopisthin (probably Clinopistha). The L-shaped structures are nymphae supporting an external ligament.\n\n2. Although the figured topotype S. primaeva used by Cox is a solemyin, the simple buttress and entire posterior adductor are consistent with Acharax but not Solemya. Previously, Bailey (2011, p. 30) argued that S. primaeva (and its possible variant, S. parallela Beede and Rogers, 1899) should be placed in Acharax (see Appendix).\n\n3. Cox’s conclusion that the internal “ridge” (= buttress) originates at the anterior end of the “chondrophore” and diverges from it at an acute angle was questioned by Dickins (1999) and is unsupported by the many published internal molds attributed to Janeia. Whereas it is true that the anterior end of the “chondrophore” (i.e., submarginal nymph) joins the buttress in modern Solemya, the two structures show no such connection in published specimens attributed to Janeia. Instead, the buttress in the topotypes is simple, continuing, as in Acharax, without connection or interruption along its entire length.\n\nIn a notable departure from the Treatise diagnosis, Liljedahl’s (1984b, p. 27) reinterpretation of Janeia represents a revival of the criteria of valve inequality and overlap formerly advocated by Meek (1876), Beushausen (1895), and Dechaseaux (1952). His species, Janeia silurica Liljedahl, 1984a (Silurian of Mölbos, Gotland), is herein placed in the Clinopisthinae. As shown in his photographs (Liljedahl, 1984a, fig. 14A-J; 1984b, text-fig. 1.1-1.6), the primary ligament (parivincular, opisthodetic) was attached at strong external nymphae. The parivincular primary ligament, internal features, and anteroventrally extended shell profile all support Pojeta’s (1988, p. 217) contention that J. silurica should be reassigned to Dystactella. However, the left-over-right umbonal overlap in J. silurica is associated with a minor subumbonal ossicle (Liljedahl, 1984b, fig. 14H, 14I) present only in the right valve. The significance of this unique feature, which has elsewhere not been reported in Dystactella, was discussed by Bailey (2011).\n\nOther studies accepting Janeia as a valid genus include Zhang (1977), Kłapciński and Karwowski (1978), Bernard (1980), Muromtseva (1981), Muromtseva and Guskov (1984), and Zhang and Pojeta (1986) (see Appendix). Like Cox (1969) before them, these studies either incorrectly accepted the ligament of Janeia as internal or do not mention the ligament at all. Bernard (1980, p. 21) regarded Janeia as a Permian subgenus of Solemya marked by prominent umbos at the posterior ¼ of the shell. Treating Janeia as a separate genus with a range of Silurian-Triassic, Nevesskaja, et al. (2013, p. 90) placed diagnostic emphasis on valve overlap.\n\nJANEIA VERSUS JANACEKIA\n\nThere is a significant complication to the Janeia story. Růžička and Řehor (1978) were critical of King’s (1850) withdrawal of the name Janeia in favor of Solemya, arguing that King had failed to provide objective evidence that Janeia was related to Solemya. Determination of the anterior and posterior ends of the shell, placement of the ligament, and organization of the internal anatomy, they asserted, were King’s personal opinions. Yet, because King’s original diagnosis of Janeia is both ambiguous and subjective, they were also critical of subsequent authors who adopted the name. Curiously, however, Růžička and Řehor (1978) agreed with King’s erroneous opinion that the long end of the shell is posterior. In their study of an assemblage of Janeia -like shells from the Carboniferous of the Czech Republic, Růžička and Řehor (1978) concluded that the ligament was external, rather than internal, as King (1850) and subsequent authors had alleged. By comparing their shells to those of extant Solemya togata, Poli 1795, they also affirmed that King (1850) was wrong in asserting that the ligament of Janeia, like that of Solemya, was internal. Unfortunately, the authors did not compare their material with extant examples of Acharax, comparing them instead to the solecurtid genus Tagelus Gray, 1847, which they selected as an archetype. Because their interpretations agreed neither with Solemya nor Janeia sensu King, they proposed a new genus, Janacekia Růžička and Řehoř, 1978, herein accepted as a junior synonym of Acharax. Thus, there is neither justification for recognition of Růžička and Řehoř’s family Janacekiidae nor any basis for regarding it as synonym of the Solemyinae as opposed to the Acharachinae (contra Bieler, et al., 2010, p. 115).\n\nBoth Acharax and Janacekia share the same shell profile, the same thick periostracum marked by radial ribs and lirae, and the same primary ligament (external, parivincular, opisthodetic). Significantly, the ligament of Janacekia as originally described by the authors is ironically in agreement with Acharax but not Solemya: “Ligament ist ein äußeres, kurz und opisthodet.” (Růžička and Řehoř, 1978, p. 37). However, because their understanding of anterior and posterior is reversed, the term “opisthodet” was incorrectly applied. Thus, this portion of their description becomes essentially correct but for the wrong reason.\n\nOf critical importance in diagnosing Janacekia is a unique feature Růžička and Řehor termed the “pseudolunula”, consisting of paired external lamellae located on the brevidorsm. Having observed an equivalent feature in “Solemya” radiata Meek and Worthen, 1866 (Pennsylvanian of Illinois), they suggested that “S.” radiata would more reasonably placed in Janackeia rather than Solemya. However, based on examples with well-preserved ligaments from the Mazon Creek Lagerstätte (Pennsylvanian of Illinois), Bailey (2011) transferred “S.” radiata to Acharax. Visual comparison of the brevidorsum of Janacekia (e.g., fig. 64 of Růžička and Řehoř, 1978) with that of Acharax (e.g., pl. 2, fig. 2 of Pojeta, 1988) demonstrates that the “pseudolunula” and external nymphae are synonymous.\n\nJanacekia and Acharax show additional similarities that further secure their identity. As shown in figure 61 of Růžička and Řehoř (1978), the buttress in Janacekia, as in Acharax, is simple, extending dorsally from the anterior limit of the posterior adductor scar to the underside of the umbo without any suggestion of attachment to nymphae, and the posterior adductor muscle shows no indication of dorsal occlusion.\n\nAlthough the analysis of Janacekia by Růžička and Řehor (1978) is comprehensive, it contains numerous errors and internal contradictions. For example, in their extensive biometric section (p. 18-27) the anteriorly elongate shell orientation is understood correctly, whereas, in the systematic section, the incorrect orientation (posteriorly elongate) is applied beginning on their page 37: “Der Vorderteil der Schalen ist kurz, enger als die Hinterzeite. Die hintere Teil ist stets länger als die Vordere.” In addition, the authors provided a detailed reconstruction (their fig. 65) of the foot and pedal accessory musculature (pedal protractor, retractors, and elevators) placed at the short end of the shell, which they regarded incorrectly as the anterior.\n\nInterpretative errors notwithstanding, the deltoid outline of the distinctive external, convex-upward ligament of Acharax is documented in those authors’ photos of Janacekia herberti (pl. 1, fig. 2, showing collapsed ligament with nymph termini), and Janacekia leosi (pl. 7, fig. 9). Moreover, deltoid traces (or possible traces) of the external ligament of Janacekia herberti and Janacekia leosi seem evident in several of their other photos (pl. 3, fig. 12; pl. 8, fig. 9; pl. 11, fig. 4; and especially both pl. 7, fig. 9 and pl. 14, fig. 6). Traces of the anterior ligamental extension like Acharax radiata (Meek and Worthen, 1860) as figured by Bailey (2011, pl. 3, 4) are evident in their pl. 6, fig. 8. The type species, Janacekia herberti from the Carboniferous (Namurian) Ostrava Schichtengruppe, Upper Silesian Coal Basin, Czech Republic, is so remarkably similar to Acharax radiata (Meek and Worthen) from the Mazon Creek Lagerstätte that, aside from differences in the relative relief of the radial ribs, the two are nearly indistinguishable. For example, compare Růžička and Řehoř (1978, pl. 7, fig. 9) with Bailey (2011, pl. 3, figs. 1-9; pl. 4, figs. 1-7). Interestingly, Růžička and Řehoř listed numerous specimens referred by various authors to Solemya primaeva Phillips (= type species of Janeia King, 1850) as synonyms of both Janacekia herberti and Janacekia leosi. However, as noted above and by both Bailey (2011, 2016) and Logan (1967), S. primaeva is a probable Acharax.\n\nIn addition to J. herberti, three additional species of Janacekia (i.e., J. leosi, J. mariae, and J. talboti) were described by Růžička and Řehor (1978) (see Appendix). However, the apparent differences in shell profile and prosopon, which both seem fairly minor, are possibly due to variable taphonomic effects on the thin shells and compliant periostracum.\n\nCONCLUSIONS\n\nCharacter state analysis of the primary ligament and its support structures argues that Acharax and Solemya are monophyletic, a conclusion now in harmony with 18S rRNA and DNA studies (Taylor et al., 2008; Sharma et al., 2013). Thus, classification systems placing the two genera in separate families or superfamilies are not supported; Pojeta’s (1966) placement of the two genera together in a single family and subfamily (Solemyidae: Solemyinae) is preferred.\n\nWithin the Solemyidae the external ligament and nymphae of Acharax, Clinopistha, Dystactella, and Psiloconcha are shared primitive (symplesiomorphic) characters, whereas the unique submarginal ligament and nymphae of Solemya are shown to be derived (autapomorphic) characters.\n\nThe submarginal nymphae of Solemya arose through depression of the external nymphae of Acharax ancestors followed by secondary overgrowth of a thin outer shelly layer, thus covering the ligament as well as its supporting nymphae and the internymphal gap separating them. Previously, submarginal nymphae in Solemya have been unsuitably termed “chondrophores”, thus obscuring their homological relation to external nymphae of Acharax.\n\nThe adjusted ranges of Acharax and Solemya are: Lower Devonian-Holocene for Acharax; and Mesozoic (possibly Jurassic)-Holocene for Solemya.\n\nWhere ligaments are not preserved, fossil Acharax and Solemya are distinguishable from internal molds. New terms representing these characters are introduced: An internymphal gap, evident in Acharax, is absent in Solemya; a simple buttress, evident in Acharax, is compound in Solemya; an entire posterior adductor scar, evident in Acharax, is occluded in Solemya.\n\nMisconceptions relating to King’s (1850) Paleozoic genus Janeia have been instrumental in obscuring the monophyletic connections between Acharax and Solemya. Especially significant is the erroneous belief that Janeia, like Solemya, possessed an internal ligament - incorrectly presumed to represent a primitive (plesiomorphic) condition.\n\nKing’s (1850) material basis for Janeia is critically reviewed. Although the figured type of J. primaeva (Phillips, 1836) (= King’s selection as type species) is lost, topotypes have an external primary ligament and should be placed in Acharax. The remaining designated species of King (1850) are J. biarmica (de Verneuil, 1845) and J. phillipsiana (King, 1848). King’s example of J. biarmica is a misidentified Wilkingia elegans (King, 1850), whereas de Verneuil’s (1845) figured type designated Solemya biarmica is a clinopisthin, probably Dystactella. Janeia phillipsiana of King is an alleged fiction based on non-existent fossils.\n\nIn this study, Paleozoic solemyids previously placed in Janeia have been found to be mainly assignable either to Acharax, Dystactella, or Clinopistha. Other alleged Janeia (misidentifications) are not solemyids (see Appendix).\n\nBased on King’s (1850) erroneous assertions, subsequent authors were persuaded that Paleozoic solemyids possessed an internal ligament. De Ryckholt (1854), Beushausen (1895), and Hind (1900) misinterpreted the internymphal gap as an orifice (or slit) through which a presumed internal ligament was permitted to emerge to the outside. The small ossicle shown in Quenstedt’s (1930) transverse section of J. truncata, is reinterpreted herein as an external nymph rather than an internal chondrophore as he had originally supposed. Unfortunately, Quenstedt’s misinterpretation coupled with King’s erroneous conclusions formed the principal basis for acceptance of Janeia as a valid subgenus by Cox (1969) in the Treatise, Part N.\n\nJanacekia is a problematic genus originally proposed by Růžička and Řehoř (1978) as a rejection of Janeia based on its inherent ambiguity and confusing history. Present analysis shows their interpretation of the shell orientation and ligamental structure to be incorrect. Janacekia is herein accepted as a junior synonym of Acharax.\n\nACKNOWLEDGEMENTS\n\nI am grateful to M. Taviani, L. Angeletti, and A. Ceregato for use of the photo shown in Figure 3A and to M.
