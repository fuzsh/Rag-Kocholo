This University-wide ceremony, where Syracuse University Chancellor and President Kent Syverud will formally confer degrees, is for all undergraduate, graduate and doctoral candidates. Doors open at 8 a.m.\n\nFollowing Commencement, all 2020 Newhouse graduates and their families are invited to join Dean Mark J. Lodato and the faculty and staff for a celebratory reception. The event will include a dean’s welcome, recognition of participating graduates and an opportunity to reconnect with faculty. A precise time and location will be announced soon; stay tuned for details.\n\nFor more information about Commencement activities for the Class of 2020, see the event listing.\n\nNewhouse Students Cover 2024 Presidential Nominating Conventions\n\nAbout two dozen Newhouse students covered both the Republican and Democratic presidential nominating conventions this summer. Led by Joel Kaplan, associate dean of graduate programs, the students gained invaluable experience and built up their resumes through their robust coverage for professional media outlets which included writing stories, creating packages, conducting interviews and more.\n\nCoverage from the Republican National Convention\n\nStefanik Puts NY-21 Center Stage With Prime Time Speech at Republican National Convention\n\nDay 1 of the RNC\n\nCoverage from the Democratic National Convention\n\nWhy John Mannion sat out the DNC as NY-22 takes center stage among Dems\n\nAs party picks Harris, women take center stage among New York’s Democrats: ‘It’s our time’\n\nAlabama Trump voter speaks at DNC, endorses Kamala Harris\n\nNew to Newhouse? Five Tips for First-Year Students\n\nThe Newhouse School welcomes over 500 first-year and undergraduate transfer students this fall. To help them get accustomed to life at Syracuse University, Newhouse offers an introductory course that aids students in learning the ins and outs of life at the school, covering everything from getting involved in extracurricular activities and where to go for help, to recognizing their responsibilities as students.\n\n“One of the main goals of the COM 100 intro class is to get students to think about what they need to do to succeed in college,” said Karen McGee, assistant dean of student success. “What new skills or challenges do they need to learn or experience that they didn’t have in high school?”\n\nWith the Fall 2024 semester starting today, McGee offered some tips for incoming students as they take their first steps toward a career in communications.\n\n1. Read the syllabus\n\nThe blueprint of a college course, the syllabus outlines goals and often provides details of what will be covered each class, along with assignments and other important academic information. It’s important to read a syllabus carefully and ask questions of instructors if you’re not clear on deadlines and expectations.\n\n“It’s a simple way to get started on the right track: read the syllabus and check with your professor if you’re not sure about something. Sync important dates with the calendar on your phone,” McGee said.\n\n2. Manage your time\n\nSuccessful time management makes for successful students, McGee said. Keep virtual calendars up to date and set reminders on your phone, or maybe a planner or wall calendar is your time management strategy of choice. If you’re looking for other ideas, talk to classmates or ask advice from your peer adviser.\n\nAn additional tool for managing your time is the new Syracuse University app, OrangeNow. It’s a customizable app students can use to link with MySlice so it will show their personal schedule, McGee said. They can bookmark things, check assignments, see the bus schedule, the weather and more.\n\nThe Syracuse University Center for Learning and Student Support also offers “Maximize Your Learning” one-on-one sessions for students to help them organize their work for the semester.\n\n3. Visit faculty during office hours\n\nThis is the one of the most important things that a student can do to help themselves succeed, McGee said. A faculty member’s office hours are usually listed on the syllabus. “Even if you have no pressing concerns, it can be helpful to meet your professors at least once during the semester and give them a chance to know who you are,” McGee said.\n\n4. Ask for help\n\nIt’s OK for students to feel anxious before tests and stressed when project deadlines are piling up. It’s understandable to feel lonely being away from home and familiar support structures. Resources are available at Syracuse to help.\n\nOne step a student can take is to contact their academic adviser. The Newhouse Academic Advising Office helps students navigate their new environment while making sure they’re on track to achieving their academic goals.\n\nThe University also offers many options to help address the health and wellness of students, including mental health counseling at the Barnes Center at the Arch.\n\n“There is ‘normal stress’ during the academic year. Stress or anxiety can become a problem if they prevent you from handling day-to-day responsibilities,” McGee said. “The important thing is to speak up, because help is available.”\n\n5. Get involved!\n\nOne of the easiest ways to meet new people and start making connections is by getting involved in extracurricular activities. Newhouse students can connect with more than 30 organizations across campus that cover the communications spectrum, from The Daily Orange, the independent campus newspaper, to Hill Communications, the award-winning public relations firm based at the Newhouse School.\n\nGet a head start on getting involved at the Campus Media Fair to be held outside Newhouse 1 on Friday, Aug. 30 from 1-4 p.m.\n\nAn earlier version of this story was posted in September 2023.\n\nPhoto Gallery: Welcoming New Students\n\nThe Newhouse School welcomed first-year and transfer students to campus this week. At a reception Thursday, students mingled with their new classmates, staff, faculty and student peer advisers.\n\nDean Mark J. Lodato welcomed our new students at his welcome reception Friday at Goldstein Auditorium in the Schine Student Center. Classes start Monday. We’re looking forward to a great Fall 2024 semester!\n\nPhotos by Malcolm Taylor unless otherwise noted.\n\nSyracuse University’s Newhouse School Launches Bandier Music Business Master’s Program\n\nThe Newhouse School is offering a new master’s degree in music business, expanding on the success of the prestigious undergraduate program in the recording and entertainment industries.\n\nBoth degree programs are named after Martin Bandier ’62, the legendary music publishing executive and Syracuse University Life Trustee. The Bandier Program for Recording and Entertainment Industries is regularly recognized as one of the preeminent undergraduate music business programs in the country.\n\nThe new Bandier music business master’s program will offer students the same top features that set apart the undergraduate program, delivering hands-on experiences, training for cutting-edge skills needed to make students job-ready upon graduation and access to the large and loyal networks of Bandier and Newhouse alumni.\n\nBillboard magazine has never published its list of the world’s top music business schools without including the Bandier program.\n\n“Our goal at the Bandier program has always been to be the premier music business school, offering the most comprehensive and cutting-edge education while forging top-tier industry connections,” Bandier said. “With this new master’s program, we’re taking it to the next level, shaping future music leaders who are equipped, connected and ready to make their mark.”\n\nLaunching in fall 2025, the Bandier music business master’s program provides a true multidisciplinary education to prepare students for their first job in the music industry. The comprehensive program will cover subjects including the fundamental rights, royalties and deal-making approaches of the modern music business, across the label, publishing, management, streaming and live sectors, and all genres.\n\nThe core music business instruction will allow students to be well-versed on the basics of everything from music law and copyright to current social media and data tools in use by top companies today. Students will also be able to spend a semester in Los Angeles to work in the heart of the music industry.\n\nThe new master’s program will be overseen by Bill Werde, who is also director of the Bandier undergraduate program. Before joining the Newhouse School, Werde served as editorial director of Billboard, which won a 2010 Ellie Award for Digital Media from the American Society of Magazine Editors during Werde’s tenure. Under his direction, Billboard also earned Eddie Awards for Best Media and Entertainment Publication from Folio magazine in 2006 and 2007.\n\n“Breaking into the music industry can be daunting. If you have great instincts and passion for what fans love in music and how those tastes evolve, the new music business master’s program will give you all the access, skills and network you need for an incredibly fulfilling career in the music industry,” Werde said. “The Bandier program will open doors for students for the rest of their lives.”\n\nThe program presents “a fantastic opportunity for college graduates to acquire the dynamic skills and gain the hands-on experiences that will help them succeed in the thriving music business,” Newhouse Dean Mark J. Lodato said. “We are eternally grateful at Syracuse University for the support of Marty Bandier and his enthusiasm to help the Newhouse School provide a first-class education for students aspiring to work in the recording and entertainment industries.”\n\nNewhouse Impact: Invaluable Experiences for Students at Empire State Winter Games\n\nThe latest Newhouse Impact research roundup also covers more about the increasing importance of media literacy education.\n\nNewhouse Impact Podcast\n\nThe professional world of communications, whether its photography, journalism or other fields, can be fast-paced and demand top quality. One program is giving students experiences where they can hone their craft, and also expand their notion of what it means to be a professional in communications.\n\nOn this episode of Newhouse Impact, Jon Glass, professor of practice in magazine, news and digital journalism and Newhouse executive editor, Seth Gitner, associate professor in magazine, news and digital journalism and visual communications, and multimedia, photography and design graduate student Surya Vaidy discuss a collaboration between Newhouse and the Empire State Games.\n\nStudents can run from skiing to hockey to other winter sports competitions, taking pictures and video, interviewing athletes and coaches, chronicling the events. The build their portfolios and skills, while also getting lessons in what is expected in the professional world.\n\nListen to the full show by visiting the WAER episode page.\n\nAlso listen to: Media Literacy beyond understanding content; its role in social justice & empowerment\n\nMany scholars have noted that education on media literacy is increasingly important as social and digital media become bigger parts of people’s lives.\n\nOn a recent episode of “Newhouse Impact,” Newhouse communications professor Dr. Srivi Ramasubramanian and mass communications doctoral student Shannon Burth expand the notion of media literacy beyond simply understanding the more about the media we consume. Their research also examines the ability to use media, to act and be empowered, and their importance as tools for social justice. They further include understanding the spread of AI and algorithms that increasingly control what is presented in various media.\n\nRecent accolades, highlights and notes\n\nThe Newhouse Impact Summit was held Aug. 1-2 and featured speakers from around the world presenting their innovative and provocative creative and scholarly work on the past, present and future of storytelling through extended reality technologies.\n\nSeveral Newhouse School faculty members and students participated in the annual AEJMC conference on Aug. 7-11 in Philadelphia, PA.\n\nSenior Associate Dean Regina Luttrell received the NCA Public Relations Division PRIDE Committee’s Outstanding Book Award for her book “Strategic Social Media as Activism.”\n\nNewhouse School faculty talked about the study of artificial intelligence and how it touches our lives.\n\nBob Papper and Keren Anderson published reports on RTDNA on their research on representation in radio news, reporter safety and TV news digital initiatives.\n\nJosh Darr wrote about what he’s learned from his research into local news and polarization.\n\nShelly Palmer discussed Google’s controversial “Dear Sydney” Olympic ad.\n\nNewhouse Alumnus Chris Bennett G’22 Creates Award-Winning Short Film\n\nIn his time at the Newhouse School, multimedia, photography and design alumnus Chris Bennett G’22 worked on a short film that extended far beyond the classroom.\n\nFor his master’s thesis, Bennett created “Level One,” a four-minute fully animated piece that takes the viewer through a video game race between two brothers. The project has received national recognition in the animation community, being selected to screen at over 20 film festivals and winning at the Cayuga Film Festival. From concept to final edit was a year-long process executed during the graduate program, Bennett says, and the short film was paramount in securing his current position as a motion designer at Trusted Media Brands in Wisconsin.\n\nHow did you develop the concept and storyline for your short film?\n\nI wanted to do a fully animated film for my master’s thesis and knew that going in. It’s based on playing video games with my brother, and that’s how we bonded. He was six years older than me, so if we played sports, it’d probably be a little unfair. Video games were more of a level [playing] field to hang out.\n\nWhat lessons and skills did you learn while creating your short film?\n\nI learned pre-production and production things from Professor Shaina Holmes’s visual effects class, from file management to the overarching production schedule. Scheduling, labeling, organizing and producing the shots is like her bread and butter. That translates to animation and was a way to really break down a project from scripts to storyboard. Then trying to come up with a story and writing it is the hardest part, and having a nice arc from a climax to rising action. So I felt like a race would just be as simple, like beginning, middle and end.\n\nWhat does the recognition that your film has been receiving mean to you?\n\nIt’s awesome. I went to grad school and was 26 years old. I thought it was kind of a career pivot, and now I’m working full time as a motion graphics animator and get to go to these festivals for animation for something I did. It’s kind of a dream come true.\n\nHow have your Newhouse coursework and experiences impacted your development in animation and your career?\n\nNewhouse gave me a lot of flexibility to learn what I wanted and also pushed me to know if you’re going to do it big, do it right. So I took the time to make this film what it could be, and it’s obviously still a student film, but I think it still shows a lot of skill sets, from writing to software use and design. Classes in motion design, typography, design and visual effects are huge pillars, but I still like harking back to my work every day.\n\nWhat advice would you share with other Newhouse students interested in or pursuing animation or a project like this?\n\nI would say start small. Do a really short project and don’t shoot for the stars right away. And ask for help when you don’t know how to do something. Asking for help is really how you build your network.\n\nSuccess Through Syracuse\n\nAlumna Amanda Quick shares how her journey of opportunity and connection led to a dynamic career.\n\nWhen Amanda Quick ’14, G’16 enrolled in Syracuse University’s S.I. Newhouse School of Public Communications, she intended to follow the trail blazed by renowned broadcasters like Dick Clark ’51, Bob Costas ’74 and Mike Tirico ’88—and she had a four-year plan mapped to help her achieve that goal. But just a few weeks into her first semester, Quick attended the Involvement Fair—where students learn about student organizations and other opportunities on campus—and found herself drawn to a range of activities that were not part of her plan. “I realized there was so much available to me at Syracuse University—so many things I wanted to participate in—I decided to be flexible and open to opportunity.”\n\nSpontaneous commitment to the Division I women’s rowing team is just one of many opportunities Quick embraced during her time at Syracuse. She also added minors in marketing and Chinese studies, interned at the Olympics in London, studied abroad in Hong Kong, traveled the country to interview young entrepreneurs and earned a master’s degree in a new field. Ultimately, Quick’s Syracuse experiences helped her launch a rewarding career working for Fortune 500 companies—a professional trajectory she could not have imagined when she first stepped on campus, but one that perfectly reflects the balance she found between being open to new experiences and ideas and keeping true to her core motivations.\n\nReflecting on all she learned in the process, Quick, who was recently celebrated with the Generation Orange Award and induction onto the board of Newhouse Emerging Leaders, shared some of the valuable takeaways.\n\nTake Advantage of Professional Opportunity Through Alumni Connection\n\nFrom the start, Quick—a broadcast and digital journalism major—sought to gain professional experiences. She joined a student-run radio station as DJ and business development director and participated in multiple internships.\n\nQuick first experienced the supportive community of the Orange network during her internships. She relished interning with BrandYourself, a reputation management company founded by three Syracuse alumni (and which later appeared on ABC’s Shark Tank). Her connection with Syracuse also helped her secure three summer internships with NBC Sports, where she worked with alumni who ensured she had diverse and meaningful experiences. “This is really where the Syracuse connections come in. The Newhouse alumni I met made sure I had extraordinary access. I got to sit on set, meet the talent—it was amazing,” she says.\n\nFocus on What You Love Doing More Than Job Titles\n\nQuick’s professional experiences helped her clarify and refine her goals. “At first, I was focused on becoming a reporter and anchor. But I came to understand that at the core, my passion is storytelling. When I focused on that, rather than a particular job title, I found so many creative ways to tell stories,” she explains.\n\nOne of the projects Quick found most meaningful entailed research on college-aged entrepreneurs. “I was awarded funding through the Renée Crown University Honors Program and traveled to universities across the country to meet incredible students who were building companies and startups right from their dorm rooms,” she says. “The project also allowed me to tap into new mediums and platforms in exciting ways. I was telling stories, but not from an anchor desk.”\n\nWhat’s Next at Newhouse\n\nThe Newhouse School today stands as one of the most well-regarded schools of communications in the country, with programs that represent all areas of the industry. Its roots at Syracuse University stretch back more than 100 years, to the founding of the Department of Journalism in 1919. And those roots are still strong.\n\n“At the end of the day, journalism remains the heartbeat of the Newhouse School,” says Dean Mark J. Lodato. “Journalism is where we serve our most important purpose, as it is critical to our democracy.”\n\nThat sense of purpose underpins the school’s new academic strategic plan, created last fall as part of a campuswide strategic planning process launched by Vice Chancellor, Provost and Chief Academic Officer Gretchen Ritter that resulted in individual plans for each school and college as well as a University plan, “Leading With Distinction.”\n\nSome 300 faculty, staff, students and alumni worked on the Newhouse plan, a comprehensive document that outlines a dynamic vision for the school’s future and charts a course for the next five years.\n\nHere, Lodato discusses highlights of the plan and opportunities for the school moving forward.\n\nDefending the role of journalism in our democracy has become increasingly critical. What part will the Newhouse School play in that effort?\n\nI expect to see robust growth in our impact over the next five years. With the establishment of the Institute for Democracy, Journalism and Citizenship (IDJC), a joint effort with the Maxwell School of Citizenship and Public Affairs, we are working toward a return to civil discourse and underscoring the importance of journalism in our democracy. The institute allows for cross-college collaboration and industry partnerships. Together with NBC News, IDJC is staging a series of focus groups to gain insights from key voting blocs in 2024 presidential election battleground states. The institute has also received a $250,000 grant to look at misinformation in the presidential election, which will involve IDJC researchers working with Senior Associate Dean Jennifer Stromer-Galley from the School of Information Studies, who is an expert in this area. All these things bring immense value to our country and our society.\n\nThe concept of engaged citizenship is an important tenet of the University plan, and IDJC obviously plays into that. In what other ways does engaged citizenship resonate for Newhouse?\n\nWe are producing students who want to engage. We are producing storytellers and journalists, advocates and persuasive communicators. We are keeping our communities informed, we are entertaining our communities and, as journalists, we’re taking responsibility for the future of our communities. We are also applying for grants that will help support local news and looking at how the school can work with media outlets or local organizations—especially in rural areas—to keep communities informed. An example of how this can work is the reporting and writing our students do to help [public radio station] WAER cover Central New York. Our students are also working with professional journalists from the USA Today Network and Central Current as part of a reporting team investigating the impact of police vehicle crashes on communities throughout New York state. That project is led by faculty members Jodi Upton and Nausheen Husain.\n\nTalk about ‘digital citizenship,’ a key phrase in Newhouse’s academic strategic plan.\n\nOne major focus for the school is the connectivity between communications and technology. For years, we have enjoyed tremendous success and rich relationships with legacy media, and we need to continue that. But to truly lead in the future, we need to train our students around technology and communications. So that’s companies like Microsoft, Amazon and Netflix, and it is technologies like augmented reality, virtual reality and artificial intelligence.\n\nWe must ensure that our students can succeed in a rapidly changing communications environment. But that includes training and educating them to be good stewards of this technology. When we talk about digital citizenship, we’re talking about what it means to use technology responsibly if you’re a content creator, and also what it means to use technology in a responsible way if you’re a consumer. Newhouse can play a role in both those areas. We’re educating students, but we can also educate news consumers. It is a real opportunity for us.\n\nHow will the school embrace that opportunity?\n\nWhat we envision is what we are currently calling the Advanced Media Lab. I see it as a hub, ensuring that our departments and faculty use technology—the latest, greatest technology—in the most effective way within our curriculum. It can also be a conduit to external partners and resources. In three years, I would love to see a large company send their employees to us for training in artificial intelligence or corporate communications strategy, for example. It would be educational but would also provide avenues for collaboration with these amazing organizations when they bring their people to campus. We’re currently hiring a new faculty member to be part of this exciting effort and talking to companies about engaging with us at a high level.\n\nWhat are some other areas of opportunity for the Newhouse School?\n\nOur study away programs in Los Angeles and New York City are already strong, and we will continue to expand those while also working to grow our newer program in Washington, D.C. We are raising money to help reduce barriers to access so that 100% of students can take advantage of the opportunity to spend a semester in one of those cities or abroad. We’ll offer more Newhouse DEIA courses at study abroad locations, including a class in Santiago, Chile, that examines diversity in Chilean film, or a course in Madrid that addresses stereotypes in Spanish advertising.\n\nNewhouse is a leader, if not the leader, when it comes to experiential learning. Look at what our students have the opportunity to do, whether in Syracuse or off campus—reporting on Capitol Hill, producing content in New York City or Los Angeles. Few schools can rival that.\n\nKey Points\n\nThe Newhouse Academic Strategic Plan will guide the school’s core mission of providing a top-of-class educational experience focused on preparing graduates for a communications career. The Newhouse School will foster the next generation of alumni and support the faculty and staff so instrumental in helping our students succeed.\n\nWhile the plan sets 2028 as the target to reach goals, this blueprint will provide a foundation for Newhouse into the next decade and beyond.\n\nTop commitments\n\nGrow programs and student experiences, as well as faculty research and creative activities, that focus on the intersection of democracy, journalism and citizenship.\n\nInvest in faculty projects, curriculum development and infrastructure that promote principles of inclusion and equity for students in every Newhouse communications discipline.\n\nExpand industry partnerships and collaborations to create unmatched opportunities to pursue research and creative activities for students and faculty.\n\nDevelop student excellence and advance faculty expertise in technology-driven communication tools and practices, specifically in advanced and emerging media.\n\nEmerge as a global hub for sports media and communications and the study of sports media through teaching, research and creative and professional activities.\n\nTimeline\n\nFall 2022\n\nDean Mark J. Lodato appoints a Strategic Planning Committee composed of faculty, staff and students to oversee the strategic planning process.\n\nFall 2022 semester\n\nCommittee hosts 13 listening sessions to gather input from all segments of the Newhouse community.\n\nOctober 2022-April 2023\n\nCommittee works on the strategic plan in conjunction with Dean Lodato and school leaders.\n\nMay 2023\n\nThe strategic plan is formally submitted to the University Provost’s Office.\n\nJanuary 2024\n\nImplementation of strategic plan begins, establishing benchmarks through 2028.\n\nAdapting to AI\n\nNewhouse faculty members are immersed in study and research across a host of topics that investigate how artificial intelligence touches our lives, from the challenges of rooting out fake news to the opportunities and risks that come with the integration of AI and extended reality. Here, they share insights into how AI is affecting their respective fields.\n\nThe integration of AI and extended reality (XR) offers incredible opportunities for creativity and heightened immersion, but also increases the risks of misinformation and privacy violations. XR technologies collect individualized information about users’ body motions. Generative AI can incorporate that information to create personalized interactive experiences that enhance the experiences of XR users. This has great potential for education, job-training, therapy, entertainment and gameplay. However, this data could also be used to manipulate and mislead through tailored persuasive techniques and interactions with personalized virtual avatars.\n\nAI forces the dwindling local news industry to answer a difficult question: Is AI-generated local news better than nothing? If we want AI to be a civically useful part of local news’ future, local governments need to provide transparent civic information that will train and supply AI “journalism.” One part of my research into new models of nonprofit news asks whether we can use the efforts of these new sites to create informative, equitably focused civic products (including meeting notes, how-to guides and policy analyses) that could be scaled and delivered to broader audiences using AI.\n\nWhile the challenges of fake news and misinformation are not new, the speed, scale and global impact created by digital media channels certainly are. The application of generative AI systems capable of creating completely synthetic text, images, audio and video has the potential to disrupt this dynamic and even further erode public trust. To meet this challenge, our research has had to move beyond a focus on development and evaluation of new digital detection tools and start working with these AI systems directly. By pushing AI generative capabilities to the limit, we can help shape digital literacy and ethical frameworks.\n\nThe integration of AI into mass communication classrooms has effects that will reverberate for years to come. Proper utilization and integration of AI-driven tools are key to the future of our industry. For instance, PR professionals rely on data analysis powered by AI to make data-driven decisions, a stark change from traditional roles in the field. However, rushing to incorporate AI without being aware of its vast potential and limitations can lead to unintended results. The value of artificial intelligence to professionals and rapid proliferation in strategic communication make it an indispensable addition to the field and the classroom. It is vital to research and comprehend these shifts and their ramifications.\n\nGenerative AI, like GPT-4, has revolutionized product development by automating parts of the user interface design and coding processes. Through AI, code generation can be achieved at unprecedented speed, reducing human error and enhancing efficiency. In the advanced media management program, we are examining this shift toward automated product development by studying the quality of AI-generated code and design and its impact on developers’ productivity. We are also looking at the implications of this technology on workforce policies, dynamics, job roles and skills required in the future. We aim to better understand how AI can complement human developers, rather than replace them.\n\nNewhouse Student Awards Summer 2024 Roundup\n\nLearn more about accolades received this summer by students from across Newhouse.\n\nEdward R.
