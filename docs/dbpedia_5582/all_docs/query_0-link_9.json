These private collections originated herbaria and the zoological series that would later on be part of the museum's exhibits.\n\nDuring all those years, different personalities that lead the Museum gave their own particular style and vision to its management.\n\nWhen Hermann Burmeister was named director in 1862 began a 30-year management that became the most significant in the Museum's history, due the magnitude of the implemented changes. During this stage the institution had a strictly scientific orientation and became an internationally renowned paleontological centre. In 1892 Burmeister was followed by Karl Berg, who had in mind a much more open museum. He therefore worked intensely to give the public greater access to all exhibits.\n\nIn 1902 palaeontologist Florentine Ameghino became the first Argentine director of the Museum. In those times material started to saturate the buildings capacity up to a point that it became necessary to close its doors for lack of space. The Museum reopened in 1916. Under the direction ol Martin Doallo-Jurado (1923-1946) the new building in Parque Centenario was built and the Museum moved in there. This innovative management centred on increasing collections, gave impulse to research and intense disclosure of knowledge.\n\nIn 1999 Dr. Edgardo Juan Romero assumed as director. In 2011 Doctor Pablo Tubaro its present director, started his management. New in 2012, the Museum's Bicentenary, the institution is working hard to achieve a new balance between research and museology. Collections are preserved and studied by specialized researchers and technicians. Research jobs are not only performed at the lab, but the researchers also hold study and material collection campaigns and advice other entities in Argentina.\n\nThe museum, the most important of its kind in Buenos Aires and second only to the La Plata Museum of Natural Sciences, nationwide. Besides the Natural Sciences Institute, the museum houses thirteen permanent exhibition halls, including an aquarium, a display with specimens collected from Argentina's numerous research stations in Antarctica, a geological collection centered around meteorites found in Argentina, a paleontology section notable for its Carnotaurus, Eoraptor, Herrerasaurus and Patagosaurus fossils, among others, and a Cenozoic paleontology display featuring Glyptodon, Macrauchenia, Megatherium and Smilodon fossils.

The collection of the Vertebrates Paleontological Division (DPV) was created in 1877, when Dr. Francisco Pascasio Moreno, who was the first director of the museum later on, donated 15.000 pieces.\n\nThe current collection of the museum contains around 4 million items, mostly from Argentina and other South American countries.\n\nThe permanent exhibits are organized in 20 rooms located over two floors. The exhibits display the entire natural history of our planet from the formation of the Universe, through the origin of life, and even the origin of humans and their cultures.

The scientific name of these manatees is âMetaxytherium krahuletziâ, they were named after Johann Krahuletz, who had found the first bones.\n\nThey lived about 20 million years ago on the coast of the tropical Eggenburg Sea.\n\nIn the communal sand pit of KÃ¼hnring seven almost complete skeletons of manatees were discovered, which likely died together during a storm surge and debris avalanche.

The first floor is dedicated to the immense variety of animal life.\n\nBehind the scenes, collections comprising some 25 million specimens and artefacts are the essential basis for the work of over 60 staff scientists.\n\nTheir main fields of research cover a wide range of topics from the origins of our solar system and the evolution of animals and plants to human evolution, as well as prehistoric traditions and customs.\n\nGuided tours, presentations, and workshops on a variety of themes are offered regularly.\n\nThese events not only provide insight into interesting and surprising natural phenomena, but also deal with the fascinating results of scientific research.\n\nThe Museum of Natural History Vienna on the background of \"150th Birth Anniversary of Carl von Hasenauer\" stamp Austria 1983, MiNr.: 1746, Scott: 1248 Emperor Franz I on stamp of Austria 1908, MiNr.: 147v, Scott: 118\n\nThe earliest collections of the Natural History Museum Vienna date back more than 250 years.\n\nIt was Emperor Franz I Stephan of Lorraine, Maria Theresaâs husband, who in 1750 purchased what was at the time the world's largest and most famous collection of natural history objects from the Florentine scholar and scientist Jean de Baillou.\n\nThis was the first step on the road to creating the Natural History Museum Vienna.\n\nThe Natural History Museum and the Museum of Fine Arts were commissioned by Emperor Franz Joseph I (1830 â 1916) and designed by the architects Gottfried Semper (1803 â 1879) and Carl Hasenauer (1833 â 1894).\n\n(Carl Hasenauer was commemorated on an Austrian stamp in 1983.

Just 20,000 years ago, the city of Salzburg was buried under a 1,000 metre thick glacier.\n\nA special highlight is the mummy of a woolly rhinoceros from Starunia. This is a plaster replica of the animal as it appeared when found in 1929. The exhibition informs about details of this extinct rhino species and the unique finds from Starunia in today's Ukraine.

The park hosts a geological education square, a dinosaur egg fossils museum, a dinosaur museum, and dinosaur egg site, and a dinosaur simulation park.\n\nTwo rare egg species from the site were named Macroelongatoolithus xixiaaensis and Prismatoolithus gebiensis.\n\nMacroelongatoolithus xixiaaensis - is an oogenus (a type of trace fossil given a specialized genus name representing that it is a fossil egg) of large, fossil theropod eggs. These eggs are most notable for their large size of 34 - 60 centimetres long. They are also very elongated, usually roughly three times longer than they are wide. These eggs are often found in large clutches of up to 26 eggs, with the eggs forming a ring 2â3.3 metres in diameter, their shell is typically between 1.38 mm and 4.75 mm thick.\n\nPrismatoolithus gebiensis is an oogenus from the Cretaceous. These eggs, about 8 cm long and roughly ovular in shape.\n\nThe Prismatoolithid eggs are attributed to non-avian theropods on the basis of the discovery of this type of eggs with embryos of the troodontid Troodon formosus from the Two Medicine Formation in Montana, USA, and on the basis of the considerable resemblances with some avian eggshells.\n\nThere is also a dinosaur genus named after the city - Nanyangosaurus.\n\nIn 1994 the remains of Nanyangosaurus were found near the village of Houzhuang, in Neixiang county in Henan. This dinosaur is a genus of herbivorous ornithischian dinosaur and is a basal member of the Iguanodontia that lived in the Late Cretaceous of present-day Henan Province, China.\n\nNanyangosaurus was a relatively small dinosaur with an estimated length of four to five metres.

During the Mesozoic, some marine limestones were deposited in El Salvador - unfortunately, these do not have dinosaur fossils. Most of El Salvador's geology formed during the Cenozoic after the dinosaurs had died out and the fossil record of El Salvador is dominated by prehistoric mammals.\n\nMany fossils of prehistoric mammals, including 9-million-year-old teeth belonging to mastodons, an extinct group of large mammals related to elephants, are on the show in the Natural History Museum of El Salvador.\n\nSome fossils and reconstructions of prehistoric animals from collection of the museum were depicted on postage stamps of El Salvador in 1979 and 2006.

His own house quickly became too small for the huge pool of his research work, so the city of Sangerhausen bought up a large part of his collection in 1937. In 1952, the Spengler Museum opened its doors for the first time as the first completely new museum building in the GDR. The construction was organized on a purely municipal level, since it was feared that the collection holdings would be withdrawn.\n\nSteppe mammoth, Mammuthus trogontherii on stamp of local post company Suedharzer Stadt und Landkreiskurier of Germany 2003\n\nSince September 1, 2001, Spengler's former home at HospitalstraÃe 56 has been part of the overall museum and shows the history of the family, the house and living around the year 1900.\n\nA permanent exhibition presents exhibits on the topics of geology, natural history, the Ice Age, prehistory and early history, the Middle Ages, town history and the author and director Einar Schleef (1944-2001), who was born in Sangerhausen. There are also special exhibitions on a wide variety of topics throughout the year.\n\nThe skeleton of a mammoth is regarded as a special feature of the Spengler collection. It is the only complete skeleton of a steppe mammoth (Mammuthus trogontherii) in Germany. Gustav Adolf Spengler made the greatest find of his life in 1931 near Edersleben. The excavation work lasted two years in the gravel pit Edersleben by Gustav Adolf Spengler. The prepared skeleton was placed in the large hall of the Spengler Museum and has been one of the symbols of the town of Sangerhausen ever since.\n\nIt is a female specimen for which an age of 45 - 50 years is estimated. It lived before the Ice age about 500 000 years ago.

The Cenozoic is represented by invertebrates and mainly vertebrates from various German localities, including a pleistocene elephant and a copy of a mammoth mummy.\n\nAlso on exhibit is the skull of the prehistoric man of Steinheim (Homo steinheimensis). The museum also houses a spectacular collection of plant and animal fossils in amber.

Thousands of exhibits were painstakingly prepared. The most beautiful pieces can be admired in the museum.\n\nAll of the exhibits in the fossil collection were found in the BergÃ©r family's quarries. A highlight of the collection are the insect fossils, including many dragonflies, which are in an unusually good state of preservation.\n\nOver 800 different types of fossils have already been found on the Blumenberg quarry, including, for example, the primeval bird Archaeoperyx.\n\nThe original is on display in the Natural History Museum in Berlin, but a copy can be seen in the Berger Museum. Brightly lit display cases contain the \"holotypes\", fossils previously only found on the BergÃ©r family's land. They include, for example, various crabs or the dragonfly \"Bergeriaeschnidia abscissa\".\n\nThe museum was modernized in 2008, to mark its 40th anniversary.

The building burned down in 1968. Since October 2014, the museum has also been one of 26 information points in the UNESCO Geopark Swabian Alb.\n\nAuberlehaus Lore Museum in Trossingen on the cachet of German postal stationery 1984 - \"Lore museum Auberlehaus, 10 years city partnership between Trossingen and Cluses in France\". Postmark of Germany 1993 - \"275 years of Auberlehaus (1718-1993) - 30 years of philatelic club Trossingen\".\n\nThe Auberlehaus Lore Museum primarily contains information on the social history of the city in the city using reconstructed, furnished rooms and workshops illustrating 18th to early 20th century culture.\n\nIn addition to the information about the development of Trossingen from an Alamannendorf to a music city, there is also a paleontological collection.\n\nTrossingen (a town halfway between Stuttgart and Zurich) is the world's largest dinosaur site from the Triassic.\n\nFor example, during several excavations in and around Trossingen, researchers found the remains of 55 Plateosaurus.\n\nThe first skeleton of Plateosaurus was discovered in Trossingen by a group of school boys in 1909, then excavated by the team of Prof. Eberhard Fraas from the Royal Natural History Cabinet in Stuttgart.\n\nPlateosaurus is one of the first dinosaurs uncovered in Germany (1834) and one of the first dinosaurs known to the scientific community. The first appearance of Plateosaurus on a postal object is likely a postcard issued in the 1910s.\n\nIn 1979 the cast of first skeleton of a Trossinger Plateosaurus was installed in the museum.\n\nAn exhibition on the subject of dinosaurs includes dinosaurs from different habitats, as well as petrified reefs, ammonites and turtles.\n\nThe paleontological collection in particular fascinates visitors thanks to the unusual visitor guidance through the exhibits with a black background. This makes the impressive exhibits particularly stand out.

In June, 1949, under the law for the establishment of the Education Ministry, the museum was placed under the jurisdiction of the Education Minister.\n\nIts name was changed to the present National Science Museum. The only museum of this kind in Japan, the National Science Museum makes research and studies of the history of nature and natural science, exhibits data related to the studies for public view and contributes to the diffusion of knowledge concerning the history of nature and natural science among the people.\n\nToday this museum is a guardian of a valuable collection of over 4 million specimens. The Museumâs extensive collection is presented in many exhibitions.\n\nIn 2010, the Museum welcomed over 1.8 million visitors.\n\nThe National Museum of Nature and Science serves as the central research institute for natural history and the history of science and technology.\n\nThe Museum collects and systematically organizes the specimens for the national collection, preserving this heritage for the benefit of the future generation.\n\nAs the countryâs leading museum, the Museum also contributes to deepen the peopleâs appreciation of earth, life, science, and technology by promoting social education.\n\n[R5]\n\nRelated stamps: Japan 1977\n\nMoldova\n\nThe National Museum of Ethnography and Natural History of the Republic of Moldova is the first Moldavian museum.\n\nIt was founded in 1889 by baron Stuart (first, it was called \"Zoological, Agricultural, and Handicraft Museum of Basarabia\") and during the 20th century it was used as a laboratory by the local scientists: F. Ostermann, S. Miller, F. Porouchik, I. Sukhov, B. Taraboukhin, M. Pocoara and others.\n\nThe Museum was constructed in 1905, and its Oriental style is unique in Moldova.\n\nOver the years, the Museum has maintained two basic directions for its scientific effort: ethnology and natural history.\n\nNow it is famous for its geological, paleontological, zoological, entomological, archaeological, ethnographical and numismatic collections.\n\nAmong the thousands of Museum's exhibits, there is a fully articulated skeleton of the proboscid Deinotherium gigantismus, as well as famous archaeological treasures, Bessarabian carpets of the 19th century, etc.\n\nThe Museumâs collections are periodically loaned for exhibition in the museums of Europe, t he Americas, Asia, and Africa to highlight the cultural heritage of the Republic of Moldova.
