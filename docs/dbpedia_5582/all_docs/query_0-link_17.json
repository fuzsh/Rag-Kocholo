If you are unable to visit the Library, you may be able to access these resources through your local public or academic library. The Library's open-access databases are listed below as well as external links to resources, and research guides. Research Guides are available for almost all regions of the world and for a huge variety of subjects ranging from Latinx Resources on Civil Rights to Women in the French Revolution. Researchers can search by subject, research center or keyword. When searching at the collection level guides can be sorted alphabetically, most recent, or by popularity.\n\nDigitized books at the Library of Congress are growing daily, especially older publications that are free of copyright restrictions. Search the Library's Digital Collections using keywords and limits such as audio, prints and photographs, manuscripts, maps, music, software, newspapers or periodicals. If onsite, patrons may use our Stacks database to access thousands of titles including the antique editions of the American children's book series, Our Little Cousin. These non-fiction books were geared toward children and describe the lives of various children in different countries during different period in history. They can be windows into the stereotypes and cultural climate of the times.\n\nThe selection includes open-access scholarly resources in French studies, as well as more specific subject guides on topics such as the French student riots of 1968. For other open access resources try searching Internet Archive, HathiTrust and Gallica, the digital Library of the Biblioth√®que nationale de France."
