        "text": "The Institute brings together all the biological research activities carried out on the Collège de France sites, in particular the Berthelot site. These are implemented by the professors’ chair teams and the teams hosted.\n\nLearn more here.\n\nThe François Jacob Institute of Biology, located primarily at the CEA/Paris-Saclay sites of Fontenay-aux-Roses and Évry, is a research center focused on the strengthen basic research and develop translational and technological research in radiobiology and radiotoxicology human health (neurodegenerative, infectious and immunohematological illnesses) and medical and environmental genomics.\n\nLearn more here.\n\nThe aim of the Hearing Institute is to improve understanding of the principles and mechanisms that underpin the development and workings of the auditory system. Its research fields particularly include auditory perception and cognition, audio communication, multisensory integration, and interactions between the genome and the acoustic environment.\n\nLearn more here.\n\nAs part of the Institut de Biologie de l’Ecole Normale Supérieure (IBENS), the Neuroscience Section aims to discover and understand the key mechanisms underlying the functions of the Central Nervous System, from the molecular and cellular scales up to those of neuronal networks and of the communication between brain areas.\n\nLearn more here.\n\nThe Brain and Spinal Cord Institute (ICM) is a research center with an international dimension, unparalleled in the world, innovative in its design and organization.\n\nLearn more here.\n\nThe Institut Neurosciences et Cognition (INC) brings together researchers of the University of Paris from all domains of Neuroscience and Cognitive sciences – including physiologists, psychologists, psychiatrists, physicists, mathematicians and computer scientists – in a common desire to understand Brain functions and dysfunctions.\n\nLearn more here.\n\nThe Institut Pasteur is a private, non-profit foundation. Its mission is to help prevent and treat diseases, mainly those of infectious origin, through research, teaching, and public health initiatives.\n\nLearn more here.\n\nThe Institute of Psychiatry and Neurosciences of Paris (IPNP) is formed by a multidisciplinary community connecting more than 150 clinical and fundamentalist researchers as well as teacher-researchers who work in areas such as: Neurodevelopment and Psychiatry, Behaviour, Memory and Emotions, Neurovascular, Multi-scale imaging (from molecules to the brain), Translational neurosciences and molecular and cellular mechanisms of brain aging.\n\nLearn more here.\n\nLocated in the heart of Paris at the Centre Universitaire des Sts. Pères of the University Paris Descartes, the INCC breaks barriers between disciplines and thus creates new research topics and new approaches to address the complex functional and neurophysiological aspects of behavior and brain functions.\n\nLearn more here.\n\nLocated in Paris in the Département d’Etudes Cognitives (DEC) of the Ecole Normale Supérieure.The aim of research at Laboratoire de Sciences Cognitives et Psycholinguistique (LSCP) is to understand the psychological mechanisms underlying the acquisition and functioning of cognitive functions that are typically human, such as language, social cognition, and consciousness.\n\nLearn more here.\n\nThe Laboratoire des Systèmes Perceptifs (LSP) is a research unit (CNRS UMR 8248) within the département d’études cognitives (DEC) at the Ecole Normale Supérieure (ENS), Paris. Members of the unit are interested in understanding the mechanisms underlying our perception of the world, with an emphasis on vision and audition.\n\nLearn more here.\n\nThe research field of the Brain Plasticity laboratory is the study of the molecular, cellular, anatomical and behavioral mechanisms of neuroplasticity. This theme is addressed by an integrated multidisciplinary approach, combining genetics, molecular and cellular biology, neural network studies, brain imaging, physiology and behaviour.\n\nLearn more here.\n\nThe five research teams of this Neurosciences laboratory work on understanding the mechanisms that alter the functioning of the developing brain from the fetus to the adolescent , whether the origins of the dysfunctions are genetic or acquired (as a result of an infection or to physical trauma, for example) and whether the diseases are frequent or only affect a small number of patients ( rare diseases ).\n\nLearn more here.\n\nResearch at the Neuroscience department Paris Seine is centered on analysing the formation and plasticity of neural circuits and neural systems in order to decipher fundamental aspects of brain and spinal cord neurophysiology, and the resulting behaviours.\n\nLearn more here.\n\nThe unit is a merger of three CNRS laboratories (Llano, Meunier and Emiliani) under the name SaintsPères Paris Institute for Neuroscience (SPPIN). All teams are located at the St-Pères University Center.\n\nLearn more here.\n\nThe Institut de la Vision is one of the most important research centers in Europe on eye diseases. It brings together in a single building researchers, clinicians and industrial partners in order to discover, test and develop treatments and technological innovations for the benefit of visually impaired patients.\n\nLearn more here.\n\nThe Cité des Sciences et de l’Industrie is the biggest science museum in Europe, and of the three dozen French Cultural Centers of Science, Technology and Industry, promoting science and science culture.\n\nThe Musée Pasteur provides a fascinating insight into three aspects of the life and work of Louis Pasteur all in one place.\n\nThe Musée des Arts et Métiers is an industrial design museum in Paris that houses the collection of the Conservatoire national des arts et métiers, which was founded in 1794 as a repository for the preservation of scientific instruments and inventions.\n\nThe Musée de la Musique represents a collection of more than 8,000 instruments and art objects, with almost 1,000 on exhibit in the permanent exhibition space, including national treasures and legendary instruments such as a piano belonging to Chopin and a guitar belonging to Brassens."
