        "text": "Collections, botanical gardens, and museums are key places for natural history. As multi-coded spaces of knowledge, they fulfil many different functions. Their focus and their meanings have changed over time. Having originated from convent gardens and curiosity cabinets, they first became prominent in the 16th and 17th centuries within a variety of politically infused circumstances-courts, scholarly culture, patronage, trade, and colonialism. 1 The gradual separation between natural and cultural objects, which became visible by the late 18th century, transformed the landscape of collections. By the 19th century, many of them had become public museums that welcomed both professional scientists and an increasingly widening spectrum of the general public. Objects and specimens from different parts of the world were assembled in collections and museums, facilitating comparison, synopsis, and the dissemination of knowledge. Each collection has its own unique history. However, collections should also be analysed in terms of configurations that were essential to all of them-the interrelation between the collector, the object, and the viewers. Over the past 20 years, historical interest in physical spaces dedicated to the accumulation of scientific objects-specimens, visual images created to capture and analyse nature, research instruments, and living creatures, such as wild and exotic animals and plants-has grown rapidly. Collections, botanical gardens, natural history cabinets, and museums have attracted new attention, now associated with the making of knowledge rather than with more traditional stories about academic luminaries making important acquisitions for the benefit of science. 2 Paula Findlen has provided an important stimulus to such work by arguing that natural history and collections situated at the princely courts of Renaissance Italy were essential for understanding the world that dramatically expanded in the 16th century as a result of voyages of discovery and the printing press. Collections not only provided a means of controlling the influx of new objects and information, they helped to ease the tension between the authority of ancient texts and the new experiences opening up for Europe. 3 With a focus on materiality and cultural dimensions, collections become interesting not only because they can be used to illustrate a scientific argument, but also because they provide a means for scholars to reconstruct the very process of knowledge production. Collections are no longer seen as immutable entities, but rather as things and their meanings in flux. These historiographical changes include a wide range of perspectives, such as the political, social, cultural, and administrative as well as that of economic 1\n\nThe article presents a brief historical outline of the formation and development of natural history museology in Europe in the 15th–19th centuries. The development of scientific knowledge at that time affects the idea of the world order and the place of man in it, and the combination of knowledge with practical experience leads to the birth of true science. It is shown that one of the most important components of the development of natural sciences, in particular biological sciences, was the collection of naturalia (i.e. objects of natural origin), the rapid surge of interest in which contributed to the Great Geographical Discoveries. In chronological order, the further historical development of museum work from private collections in Italy to the formation of a prototype of a genuine museum, which performs the main museum functions such as amassment, storage and demonstration of collections, is considered. The role of prominent naturalists and philosophers such as F. Bacon, C. Linn...\n\nAbstract Zurich holds huge scientific collections. They contain objects from around the world, some of them dating back to the 18th century. This interdisciplinary seminar combines perspectives from the history of science and from current scientific disciplines. What do these objects tell us about Zurich's place in the global history of science? What potentials do old collections hold for scientists today? Objectives The aim of the seminar is a) to introduce students to new approaches in the history of scientific collections, and the global history of science; b) to familiarize students with current scientific research based on these collections; c) to enable students to prepare a case study on a particular collection in Zurich and thereby critically examine the historical relations between Swiss science and the wider (non-European) world. Requirements Students are expected to read texts on the history of science and collections, present and discuss them in class, prepare a case study on a particular collection or collector, present results from their research in class and write a research-paper (8-15 pages) connecting their findings to the discussions in class at the end of semester.

Associated is a very important question: how cultural and political structures became a dimension of a collection. In order to establish a Court Natural History Cabinet of its own, separate from other collections (“Physical Cabinet,” The Coin and Antique Collection), Emperor Franz Stephan von Lothringen (1708- 1765) decides in the middle of the 18th century to buy the famous ‘museo’ of Jean de Baillou, who had worked as a director of gardens and mines in Tuscany. The Collection of de Baillou consisted mainly of minerals, which were collected in Italy (some came from famous places all over the world), and fossils, particularly mussels, snails and crustaceans. It was one of the most famous and richest European collections of its type. It represented the Emperor’s passion for science, modern ‘know-how’ and his self-confidence at being a personal centre, not f...\n\nSociety in general is distant from scientific culture, it is required to bring scientific knowledge closer to the population. In this context, an effective and attractive way for scientific dissemination is the establishment of natural history museums, which are institutions of knowledge, displaying the past. Natural history museums have the natural world as their object of study; and their collections may contain the most diverse types of materials (local and/or from various parts of the world), such as zoological, botanical, geological, archaeological, among others. Scientific collections are the largest and most important source of authoritative biodiversity data, contributing to studies of biodiversity composition, evolutionary (morphological and genetic), biogeographical, phenological, as well as geological. The materials present in these collections may serve for temporal comparison, being useful to produce predictive models. Likewise, they have a fundamental role in safeguard...\n\nWe humans have a deeply curious nature. Sometimes our curiosity leads us in doing completely unproductive things and we just love to know the answers to things, even if there’s no obvious benefit. But this curiosity also draws people to explore and learn about the role and significance of a particular thing, for instance, people started to explore the natural world, millions of years ago. In every society, through the ages, people have been using plants, animals and/or their products as essential elements for their survival which defines the relationship between man and nature in the spatio-temporal context. Later, people themselves began to collect as an instinctive desire to possess natural curiosities such as corals, shells, minerals, plants, animals, and their body parts i.e. bones, horns, teeth, etc. Subsequently, museums were conceived where evidence of Natural History and its relationship with society were collected, preserved, and decoded. Most of the museums in India and abroad started with the collection of Natural History. However, the transformation from collection-oriented museums to ones that are mostly focused on the concepts and don’t have many specimens to display has brought about the need to sustain public interest. So, what is the potential of natural history museums at present? Is there any specific role of the natural history museum in our society today? How will museums present the relevance of their Natural History collections and thrive in a changing world? This paper aims to explore significant uses of Natural History collection to meet present and future environmental challenges. This paper also discusses the social relevance of natural History collection across epochs."
