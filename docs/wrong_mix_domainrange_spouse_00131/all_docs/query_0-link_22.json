In announcing a short-term election, straddling the holidays and preceding the March primaries, Gov Perry is transparently attempting to anoint an instant incumbent - in this case, GOP businessman Ben Bentzin, who failed in his 2002 bid against District 14 state Sen. Gonzalo Barrientos. The dominating issue is education, because of its importance to District 48 voters, and because of the public school finance crisis and upcoming special legislative session, likely to be called this spring. Although Bentzin is running as a moderate determined simply to “improve the schools,” he would replace his predecessor Todd Baxter as a reflexive vote for the GOP leadership, and he has already declared his support for private school vouchers “in certain circumstances” - a position indistinguishable from that of the stealth voucher promoters at the Capitol. (Ben Easton acknowledges that he is running primarily for Libertarian visibility, and he believes public schools should be privatized altogether - a position at least more straightforward than that of the current state leaders, who loudly proclaim their support for public education while they persist in bleeding the schools dry) Both Donna Howard (Eanes ISD) and Kathy Rider (Austin ISD) have school board experience, and are acutely aware of the issues facing the public schools and the necessity for the state not just to reform school finance but to fund more of it. Both are fully qualified for the seat, and it would have been helpful to hear them battle it out in a real primary. But because of the difficult arithmetic of this particular election, we strongly believe supporters of public education should unite behind a single candidate - indeed, it would have been nice if the Democratic Party had had enough common foresight to do so. By a narrow but significant margin, we believe the can- didate with the best chance to defeat Perry’s anointed candidate is Donna Howard. Howard has been a school board member and a critical care nurse, and has made education and health care the dominant issues of her campaign, which has been immediately visible and effective. She understands the predicament of the current school finance system, its specific, often contradictory effects in her district and in Central Texas as a whole, and she will be an immediate asset to the regional delegation as well as to the Democratic minority in the House. Moreover, if the Democrats are to begin their difficult return to a balancing presence in state government, they need to put their votes where their anger is, turn out in this election, and send a message to Travis County and the entire state. ■ Candidates Kathy Rider (Democrat) Donna Howard (Democrat) Ben Easton (Libertarian) Ben Bentzin (Republican) Early voting runs through Friday, Jan. 13. Election day is Tuesday, Jan. 17. Voters in District 48 may vote at any loca- tion listed below during early voting but must vote in their individual precincts on election day.

Could Have Done More Dear Editor, I used to be a regular at G/M Steakhouse for my morning paper, coffee, conversation, and cigar [“Food-o-File,” Food, Dec. 30]. The regulars included people coming for more than 20 years. G/M was renowned as a smoker’s diner. The owner was infamous for always having a cigar in his mouth. Nonsmokers could walk 50 feet to Waterloo for a smoke-free breakfast. When smoking was banned, I and many oth- ers stopped going as often and found other places with outside patios for our morning ritu- als. Nonsmoking customers did not increase to offset the loss of the smokers. G/M has been driven out of business because it wasn’t allowed to let consenting adults enjoy a legal product. Certainly we all agree that no one should be exposed to smoke against their will, but what about the freedom of people who enjoy a smoke- friendly environment? What about a business that depends on that clientele? The Chronicle could have done more to help educate the public about the unintended con- sequences of indiscriminate smoking bans and perhaps have saved a small mom-and-pop diner icon from political correctness.

Is this a graphics issue, or does the child really have extra digits? Julie Hughes Not Sumner, Me, Me, Me Dear Editor, Hi, Austin, my name is Kiloh, and I manage the Texas Psych Google group: www.groups.google. com/group/Texas-P. I read with bemusement your article, by Margaret Moser, on Sumner Erickson [\"Starry Eyes,” Music, Dec. 30]. The first inaccuracy in the Sumner article is that we are doing something \"illegal” by trad- ing CDs among ourselves for free. This activity is protected under federal law, specifically the Federal Audio Home Recording Act (3). The second inaccuracy in the Sumner article is that the Roky Trust has always been against this activity. Ms. Moser knows that this trading was set up as far back as 1999 with the help of the Roky Trust. This was when Rick Triplett was running things and Roky was living in abject poverty. We arranged to collect a “donation” for each disc traded and forward it to Mr. Triplett for distribution to Roky in the form of pocket money. People that now sit on the current Roky “Trust” were engaged in a lawsuit with the (then) Roky Trust, and all monies were being tied up in escrow. We had to call it a “donation” to get the money to Roky. That certain people now sit on the Roky Trust in positions of “Trust” galls us and we maintain that the Trust relinquished the right to legitimacy by putting these people on it. The third inaccuracy presented by Ms. Moser in the Sumner article was that Sumner Erickson “tried” to mend fences with us. This event just happened and the “story” presented by Ms. Moser is wholly untrue as she well knows. It was our group who tried to mend fences with Sumner.

Alas, after a series of increas- ingly obtuse and bizarre e-mails from him we decided to cut him loose. Kiloh Smith Phoenix, Ariz. [Margaret Moser replies: 1) Sumner used the word “illegal.” I did not. 2) Kiloh , who frequently calls himself “Satan” online, is correct in saying the Trust in its early days did not disapprove of the trading. However, when they were educated about it, their support was withdrawn. 3) The phrase “mend fences” doesn’t suggest the action as much as participation. Sumner participated in an attempt to smooth over the rift with Kiloh, and Kiloh chose to end the effort.] Dispute Over Percentage Dear Editor, In an otherwise excellent article on van- ishing prairies [“Dreaming of Buffalo,” News, Dec. 23] you say, “the Edwards Aquifer, which feeds Barton Springs ... contributes about 1% of the city’s drinking water.” Developers’ allies propagated this erroneous claim many years ago. Unfortunately, this myth sometimes gets repeated as “fact.” The Tom Green Water Treatment Plant on Town Lake actually supplies 15 to 20% of the city’s drinking water. And for much of the year, Barton Springs’ flow is the major contributor to Green’s water intake. From mid-October to mid-March, essentially the only flow into Town Lake comes from Barton Creek (see www.lcra.org/water/river_report.html). In fact, Barton Creek, due to the Springs, right now is the largest measured tributary to the Colorado River below the Llano River (see http://waterdata. usgs.gov/tx/ nwis/current?type=flow). Later on in the year, more water in Town Lake does come from the Highland Lakes. Even then, Green may draw more from the aquifer because the mouth of Barton Creek is very close by upriv- er. Also, water of different temperatures doesn’t evenly mix - cold water sinks to the bottom of Town Lake on warm summer days. Colder aquifer water could disproportionately supply the Green intake 8 feet below the lake’s surface. An implied subtext to this debate is an unstat- ed idea that the aquifer is expendable. However, a growing city that faces periodic droughts shouldn’t throw away any high-quality water resource. Some real estate interests want to replace the Green WTP with a new water plant on Lake Travis. Even though it could cost utility rate payers more to build a new water plant than to expand the old one, these interests covet the downtown land that Green sits on. Other devel- opers would love to further undermine the case for protecting Barton Springs. These are the original sources for the 1% myth. Stephen Beers [Rachel Proctor May responds: According to the Austin Water Utility , the figure is roughly 1%.] Sumner Made Right Decision Dear Editor, The story is an inspiring tale of not only a come- back, but of a brother’s devotion [“Starry Eyes,” Music, Dec. 30]. I visited Sumner [Erickson] dur- ing his Pittsburgh Symphony days (when he also was on the faculty of Carnegie Mellon Institute) and could not understand his decision to return to Austin for more pressing duties. His success is a glowing story beautifully described in The Austin Chronicle. I was wrong and he was right in making the decision to switch careers for a primary goal of participating in Roky [Erickson]’s long-awaited recovery as a legendary Austin con- tributor to the music scene. Bill Krasilovsky G/M Not Gone Forever Dear Editor, I just read Virginia Wood’s article on my dad’s restaurant, the G/M Steakhouse [“Food-o-File,” Food, Dec. 30]. It’s true that my father, Gus, has decided to hang up his spatula and turn west toward his sunset, but it doesn’t mean the G/M is gone forever. I have decided to keep the spot going and negotiated a lease with the owner of the property to reopen the classic diner that many “true” Austinites have grown accustomed to. There will be some remodeling for the next few weeks to regain that old G/M charm and, unfortunately for Gus, no smoking. I look forward to serving up good food to all the “regulars” and newbies in the coming years. Chris Vayas Nonsmokers Are Better People Dear Editor, I need to clarify something for Carl Swanson (“Postmarks,” Jan. 6). The proliferation of butts on Austin streets and sidewalks, and presum- ably in Austin watersheds, is not because of the smoking ban. It’s because the vast majority of Austin smokers are pigs. They throw their butts out of their cars. (Did carmakers suddenly quit making ashtrays?) They smoke a cigarette out- side their office (on their boss’ dime) and then throw the butt on the sidewalk. They wait for a table at a restaurant and, when they get one, throw their butts on the ground. People who’d never think of throwing trash or garbage into the street think nothing of flicking their butts there. I don’t know the solution of correcting behavior of people who are acting like barnyard animals, but nonsmokers aren’t causing the problem. Michael M. Simpson Too Much Development Already Dear Editor, Douglas Watkins writes [\"Postmarks,” Jan. 6] about the extensive development in the Barton Springs Watershed of the Edwards Aquifer, where rainfall runs off land or pavement, enters the aquifer, flows underground, and emerges at Barton Springs. There has been an awful lot of urban devel- opment over the Barton Springs Watershed. Watkins is wrong to conclude that Advanced Micro Devices should spur further urbanization by building a major campus in our most fragile water- shed and setting off a growth boom Southwest. More urban development in the Barton Springs Watershed means more pollution of Barton Springs, drinking-water wells, water supply to the city of Austin, plus more flooding downstream. Mr. Watkins points out that Motorola (now Freescale) has an enormous operation in the watershed. The residential developments Watkins points out in the watershed were spurred in large part by Motorola’s creation of a major employ- ment center in Southwest Austin and the accom- panying infrastructure. The result of that urban development is dirtier water in Barton Springs. Where rocks once glistened under clear water, they are now covered in sediment and algae.

If AMD moves to Stratus/ Free port’s Southwest Parkway land, there will be more urbanization of thousands of acres, and more pollution of Barton Springs. If AMD backs off, we can protect forever thousands of acres of undeveloped land in the Barton Springs Watershed. AMD can choose another site. The aquifer and watershed cannot relocate. The horse of urbanization is halfway out of the barn. Will we let it run wild? Colin Clark Environment Degraded Dear Editor, Silicon Labs may have helped save the aquifer, but, after the Labs’ move downtown, the total fuel burned each day by its workforce is likely to increase, and congestion on MoPac will increase by about 500 cars per day [“Silicon Labs to Move Downtown, Out of Watershed,” News, Dec. 9]. Long story short: The workers’ environment will take a hit while SOS claims a victory. Charlie Thompson First Night a Smashing Success Dear Editor, I must say that I was a bit skeptical of how Austin’s First Night would turn out [“The Last Shall Be First,” Arts, Dec. 30]. The results not only surprised me, they reaffirmed everything that I have loved about Austin. Sure, there were no giant corporate floats with inflated logos and bright flashing lights.

Instead, the parade con- sisted of community groups, dancing ants, and creative DIY mobile artwork built by Austinites. Better yet, even the crowd that gathered along the street was the eclectic mix of friendly, down- to-earth Austin people that convinced me to move here in the first place. For all of the gentrification and clone-store takeover of our city, the core of the community I love is alive and well, and First Night brought everyone back out to play. This is still a lively, unique city that I am proud to have chosen as my home base. Well done, Austin. Keep it weird in the New Year, y’all! Kai Mantsch austinchronicle.com/postmarks UPDATED DAIL Barton 'Facts' Wrong Dear Editor, An earlier letter to the Chronicle incorrectly states that the recharge zone and contributing zone for Barton Springs are extensively devel- oped and incorrectly suggests that runoff from the development would not discharge to Barton Springs [“Postmarks,” Jan. 6]. However, less than one-half of the recharge zone is fully devel- oped and only a small percent of the contributing zone is developed. Even then, substantial water-quality degrada- tion has been documented at Barton Springs (www.ci.austin.tx.us/watershed/oprslade.htm). Although some degradation has occurred, the water quality of Barton Springs is still well within swimming criteria. However, it is likely that uncontrolled urbanization in the watersheds feeding the springs will eventually cause Barton Springs to be degraded to the extent that it must be closed to swimming. Raymond Slade Jr. Certified professional hydrologist Ludicrous Response Dear Editor, I just read Kiloh Smith’s ludicrous response [p.6] to Margaret Moser’s article about Roky Erickson [“Starry Eyes,” Music, Dec. 30] ... it made me laugh my head off.

Leea Mechling The Bigger Story on Pot Dear Editor, It’s true medical marijuana didn’t get out of committee in the Texas Lege [“The Chronic Goes On,” News, Jan. 6], but a bigger story, IMO, was that the same committee (House Criminal Jurisprudence) approved HB 254 unanimously, with Republicans Mary Denny, Terry Keel, and Debbie Riddle voting for it along with former drug task force commander Democrat Juan Escobar. That bill would have reduced the penalties for low-level marijuana possession from a class B to a class C misdemeanor - meaning a traffic- ticketlike fine and a drug education class com- parable to what’s currently required in Austin for paraphernalia charges. Speaker Tom Craddick and the Calendars Committee didn’t let the bill get a vote on the House floor, but it cleared committee mostly for financial reasons: with class B’s, counties must pay incarceration and indigent defense costs, while class C’s generate fines and revenue, with fewer associated expenses. With county jails like Travis’ and most others completely full, that legis- lation should still have legs in future sessions. Scott Henson Supports Donna Howard Dear Editor, Donna Howard has the shortest learning curve in preparing for the special session on education funding of the candidates run- ning for the District 48 seat in the House of Representatives [\"Special Election for Texas House of Representatives, District 48,” Jan. 6]. The Texas Supreme Court has ordered the Texas Legislature to come up with a public education funding plan by June 2006. Donna Howard has attended House/Senate Committee meetings since 2002. She heard the discussion of the committees, the testimony of school districts, taxpayers, PTAs, large and small businesses, and the concerns of Robin Hood districts and the Equity Center. Donna helped to bring these disparate interests together in discussion panels across the state. District 48 needs Donna Howard. She can immediately participate in the discussion. She will represent the school districts of District 48 and has the respect of those she will be working with. Vote Jan. 17. Nan Clayton Former president AISD board of trustees Celebrate Roky Erickson Dear Editor, Not long ago my son Jon, who is now 35 and in the Air Force, checked the Travis County Appraisal District and told me that the home where he lived in the late 60’s with his little brother and my son Craig Stewart, was worth quite a bit more than he had expected. I remember the home as quite small and it seemed a steep price to me at $185,000 for 1,100 square feet. I preface this comment to tell you that during the time I lived there, a certain Roky Erickson, of 13th Floor Elevators fame, lived right in the same area. I spent my days, however, as a mother to Craig, and Jon David Stewart, and being a teacher at nearby St. Elmo School. My music ran in the direction of Charlie Pride, or Jim Reeves, more or less, and the 1969 Texas Longhorns were much more exciting to me than “some rock band” called the Elevators. But the fact remains, from the area of Bluebonnet and South Lamar a legend was being created at this time. Right down the street from my house, Roky Erickson, a student at Travis High, was launching his career in the now defunct 13th Floor Elevators. Oh, the “cool” people knew who he was, for they would gather at the New Orleans Club or the Jade Room in the Sixties to hear him scream “You’re Gonna Miss Me,” but not this mommy and teacher. Through Craig, I was thrilled to have the oppor- tunity to meet Roky at his 55th birthday party on Sixth Street in 2002, and I’ve enjoyed his company a few times since then at benefits and dinner at his favorite - Threadgill’s on Barton Springs. Those of you who know him are aware of how calm and charismatic he is. He’s a breath of fresh air in the complicated Austin of the 21st century. You look at him and marvel at the talent he displayed 35 years ago, cranking out songs like \"Living on Monkey Island.” Not long ago, my dream came true. I was able to relive what I missed during the late Sixties and watch Roky bravely, and without trepidation, step on the stage to once more, 35 years later, share his talent and genius with all who gathered there at Ruta Maya one hot night last summer. And now, though 61 years old, I can join my voices and scream and jump with the rest who love and adore Roky, no matter what their ages. Ask me to sing any of his songs - I can, you know, and I join with my friend, Lili Lytle [“Postmarks,” Jan. 6], in saying, “I love you, too, Roky”!

Jesse Jackson (right). Obey was a key figure in integrating the Austin Independent School District, speaking out on police treatment of minorities, and other issues. Numerous current and former elected officials from around Texas and the nation attended her funeral.

HEADLINES As of Wednesday morning, a whopping 2,403 citizens had voted early in the District 48 state House elec- tion - 2.43% of registered voters. At this rate, Todd Baxter’s successor will be selected by his immediate relatives. Get out there and vote, Westsiders! Early voting runs through Jan. 13; election day is Tuesday, Jan. 17. For more on the District 48 election, see p.24. The Texas Court of Criminal Appeals rejected Rep. Tom DeLay’s request for either dismissal of the felony indictments pending against him or a speedy trial, prompting DeLay’s withdrawal from contention for his former U.S. House leadership post and furious jockey- ing among Republican House rivals. City Council begins its 2006 deliberations with the usual batch of zoning cases and the likelihood of sharp words over council members’ reluctance to get involved in the debate over AMD’s relocation to the Barton Springs area. Meanwhile, the citizens’ Bond Election Advisory Committee confirmed its November recommendations, forwarding a $614.8 million pack- age for council consideration later this month. See p.16 and p.18. As we went to press last Wednesday night - just in case you missed it - the UT Longhorns beat the USC Trojans in the Rose Bowl, 41-38, winning the national championship behind a miraculous performance from quarterback Vince Young. On Sunday, Young announced he would enter the NFL draft, prompting the New York Times' William C. Rhoden to comment, “Perhaps Young is ahead of this time. ... There is already grip- ing about his unorthodox delivery. Thelonious Monk had an unorthodox delivery, too.” (Fans who just can’t get enough UT football are invited to show up Sunday at Memorial Stadium for a team celebration. Gates open at 5pm for a program beginning at 6:30.) NAKED CITY KOOP Radio (91.7FM) is back on the air. The building which houses KOOP at 304 E. Fifth caught fire Sunday night, and a resident of the building had to be rescued by firefighters, who themselves had to be treated for smoke inhalation. The station’s third-floor studio and offices were not damaged, but the rest of the building - which houses rehearsal and living spaces for several musicians - suffered enough damage to temporarily make entry to the studio unsafe. - Lee Nichols The No Child Left Behind Act is changing public schools throughout the country.

The grocer claims that this is the largest wind-credit purchase in the history of the U.S. and Canada and that it makes Whole Foods the only Fortune 500 com- pany to offset all of its electricity use with wind energy credits. Whole Foods says it would be physically impossible to deliver wind power directly to all of its facilities, so the energy credits, contracted through Boulder, Colo.-based Renewable Choice Energy, track the exact amount of electricity produced by a wind continued on p. 17 POINT AUSTIN Pointed Questions for 2006 When the Lege comes back to school, will they have done their homework? BY MICHAEL KING Gov. Perry got the political New Year off to a (far) right start, when he wrote a constituent that he believes “intelligent design” should be taught in Texas schools as an acceptable alternative to Darwinian biological theory. One might think, with Carole Keeton Strayhom having bolted the upcoming Republican primary, Perry would no longer feel quite so obligated to cultivate his fundamentalist base. But not so - spokeswoman Kathy Walt, an otherwise educated person who is definitely earning her flack’s salary on this one, confirmed that the governor supports teaching intelligent design (aka creationism with a college degree) as “part of the effort to teach critical and analytical thinking skills.” Along the same lines, we await the governor’s proposal for Texas students to study Flat Earth Theory as part of the effort to overthrow the secular tyranny of materialist geography When Perry’s predecessor - you remember Dynamic Dubya? - used to spout this bilge, it was impossible to determine whether he really believed Phonics Cures All Ills or was just reading the requisite cue cards. But Perry seems frankly, even bitterly smarter than the dumbed-down level of contemporary Texas politics. Maybe that explains the inevitably nasty edge to so many of his press confer- ences, when reporters spout their predictable questions and he snarls his more-predictable answers. He has to dance, but he doesn’t have to pretend he likes it. As for Strayhorn, all she had to do to get the endorsement of the Texas State Teachers Association was to declare herself an “inde- pendent.” Since her One True Party has always been Carole Keeton Strayhorn, you’d think the TSTA would at least wait a few weeks before they jumped on her careening November band- wagon. But the teachers have been wander- ing in the desert for so long even saltwater looks refreshing. Union President Donna New Haschke sheepishly called CKS “electable” - since the official endorsement score is now Perry 140, Strayhorn 1, Haschke might con- sider a refresher in Math 101. More to the point, although Strayhom has been more rhe- torically supportive of public education than Perry - and reportedly renounced vouchers in return for the endorsement - she’s done more than her own share of school-bashing. In par- ticular, she loves to bray the Big GOP Lie that “only 50%” of school funding is spent in the classroom. That’s true, of course, only if you continued on p. 16 JANUARY 13, 2006 I THE AUSTIN CHRONICLE I 15 news :: POINT AUSTIN :: FROM P.15 consider four classroom walls, a roof, cafeterias, lavatories, and incidentals like libraries and buses nothing but wasteful fripperies. Considering the Lege’s flat ed budgets over the last several biennia, there are plenty of Texas politicians who do. Cold Comfort The major Dem wannabees, former U.S. Rep. Chris Bell and former Supreme Court Justice Bob Gammage, were pre- dictably grumpy about the TSTA endorsement (which may have been printed on a white flag), though it remains to be seen if either of them can generate sufficient popular traction to make the union send regrets. If nothing else, Strayhorn’s defection promises to make the fall run a good deal more interesting for folks like me, who make a living mocking political dunderheads. Pending the post-primary signature campaign - a serious obstacle to independent Texas can- didacies - we’ve got the real chance of a four-candidate horse race: Perry, Strayhom, Kinky Friedman, and whoever survives the Bell/ Gammage March tap dance. At a minimum, that should make it more difficult for Perry to achieve an outright “mandate” for the 2007 Legislature - and if the three opposition campaigns drag the state political conver- sation a few small degrees to the left, the chances may be somewhat diminished that Vouchers for Intelligent Design can make a comeback on the House floor. Far more fundamentally important for the schools, of course, is the outcome of Perry’s Tax Reform Commission, which thus far seems one more feeble public relations exercise in avoiding serious school funding. Perry appoin- tee John Sharp’s charge seems to be to lower property taxes, find a relatively painless, “revenue neutral” busi- ness tax/sales tax alternative, and otherwise leave bad enough alone. But the increasing pressure from wealthy districts (with politically powerful constituencies) to be allowed to raise local school taxes for “enrichment” carries a potentially positive consequence. If wealthy districts can raise their own money, established legal principles of equity require the state to come up with compensatory funding for those poor- er districts (representing a sizable majority of both students and schools) that can’t raise it on their own. Some people call that “Robin Hood”; the Supreme Court has repeatedly called it the law of the land under the Texas Constitution. So it will not be a slam dunk for the Commission, nor the special session that follows in its footsteps some time this spring, to design a tax plan that moves the same des- iccated pea around under the same tired shell game and calls it “reform.” Even this credulous Lege didn’t buy that scam last year; if Perry, Sharp, Craddick & Co. try to sell the same snake oil again, this year’s prospects for a deal seem little better. ■ BESIDE THE POINT WHAT'S ON THE AGENDA As the year begins, most everybody’s attention is on the pro- posed city bond package that’s looming on the City Council schedule (see p.18). But in its inaugural 2006 session tonight (Thursday), council has several nuts-and-bolts items to decide, including: funding for East Sixth Street public improvement (Items 4 & 5), and a refugee health screening service (Item 7). Potentially juicier is Item 27, directing City Manager Toby Futrell to ask for an attorney general’s opinion on city-employee union AFSCME’s request to create a contract consultation process. But the likeliest fireworks will be lit during Citizen Communica- tions, when a string of environmental activists led by Karin Ascot and Bill Bunch will urge a council resolution against Advanced Micro Devices relocating in the Lantana tract over the Edwards Aquifer - a gesture that at least a few members have already rejected as only “symbolic.” Not coincidentally, Council Members Jennifer Kim and Lee Leffingwell will be requesting (Item 20) a staff presentation on the Regional Water Quality Plan - pre- sumably in the fond hope of heading off any subsequent AMDs. As it happens, later this evening the council is scheduled (Item 54) to hold a hearing over the disputed Lumbermen’s Tract on Davis Lane - which involves some of the same SOS/grandfather- ing issues as Lantana (see “Who’s Your Grandpa? AMD or Lumbermen’s,” Dec. 16). (Latest buzz is that the Lumbermen’s discussion will have to be postponed because of an incorrect agenda posting.) The debate will follow the usual zoning backlog, which this week considers unresolved aspects of the Greater South River City neighborhood plan (bounded by Town Lake, Ben White, 1-35, and South Congress) and the East Riverside/Oltorf neighborhood plan. Indeed, if it weren’t for zoning, council might be tempted to get into real mischief. - Wells Dunbar If the three opposition campaigns drag the state political conversation a few small degrees to the left, the chances may be somewhat diminished that Vouchers for Intelligent Design can make a comeback on the House floor. 16 I THE AUSTIN CHRONICLE I JANUARY 13, 2006 It's FiyEE to make money using the online Chronicle CLASSIFIEDS/ Place FLEE FLINT and ONLINE ADS in 70+ C\\TEGOLIES using our ONLINE CLASSIFIEDS.

Tom “Smitty” Smith, director of Public Citizen’s Texas office, applauded the decision, saying the purchase ensures that wind farms will be built somewhere in the U.S and shows how a responsible corporation can posi- tively effect energy policy. - Daniel Mottola According to Texas Attorney General Greg Abbott, so-called poker run chari- ty events violate the state’s gambling statutes. Poker runs - such as the Austin Police officer-organized event in December 2004, after which APD Cmdr. Shauna Jacobson and her husband, retired Detective Malcolm “Kurt” Jacobson, died in a drunk-driving wreck on Highway 71 - in which participants ride motorcycles to five stops, picking up a playing card at each in order to build a five-card poker hand, are popular fund- raising events with law enforcement agencies. Abbott’s decision, released Dec. 27, was in response to a request for an opinion made by Galveston Co. Criminal District Atl Kurt Sistrunk, who asked the state’s lawyer to consider the legality of pok - specifically, one recently organized Galveston Co. sheriff’s deputies who were raising money for an injured officer. According to Abbott, when participants are offered the chance for a cash prize - as in Galveston - the event runs afoul of state gambling laws. And the charity raffle exception to the law allows for the awarding of prizes based on a single winning “ticket,” but not “where prizes are awarded based on hands of cards.” (To read the full opinion, go to www.oag.state.tx.us/opinions/op50abbott/ga-0385.htm.) - Jordan Smith Controversy in Lakeway over a proposed retirement village looks like it will spill into City Council chambers. Lakeway’s zoning and planning commission approved Jan. 4 an ordinance allowing the Summit at Lakeway to exceed the city’s 100,000-square-foot development limit, to the consternation of several would-be neighbors. Chris Wittmayer, who has led the fight against the retirement complex, says it will lie 150 feet from his home in the neigh- boring Village of the Hills. Worried that it will knock tens of thousands of dol- lars off the property values of surrounding homes, he said, “We would have never bought or built on this land if we had any idea [about the retirement community].” At five stories and 530,000 square feet, the proposed center is anchored by an apartment-style independent living center, and would fea- ture outlying homes and assisted living units. Wittmayer, an attorney, alleges that mistakes by Lakeway’s City Council and zoning entities, such as improp- er public notice of the zoning hearing, have rendered the zoning changes moot, and he threatens legal recourse if the changes stand. The Summit is tenta- tively scheduled for approval by Lakeway City Council on Jan. 17. - Wells Dunbar The nonprofit Solar Austin has good news for those interested in pursuing a career in solar energy. They’ve teamed up with Austin Community College and the State Energy Conservation Office to offer a 14-week course to obtain the sought-after North American Board of Certified Energy Practition- ers Photovoltaic Entry Level Certificate of Knowledge. The certificate itself will not qualify one to install photovoltaic systems, but it does make the stu- dent eligible to enter the workforce and secure the required two years of on- the-job training to able to sit for the NABCEP PV installer exam. The class costs $475 plus lab fees and runs Jan. 30-May 6, Mondays and Wednesdays, 6-7:30pm, for the first 11 weeks, and then Saturdays, 9am- 2pm. It will run again in the fall of 2006. Instructor John Hoffner said the class is designed for people who want to go into the solar business - not only as installers, but as system designers or business managers. Near the end of the “fun and hands-on” course, he said, students will build an operat- ing solar system and connect it to the power grid.

For those with speech or hearing impairments, call TTY 800/462-7585. - Cheryl Smith BEYOND CITY LIMITS In other hurricane relief news, Americans opened their wallets to record depths in 2005 in the wake of hurricanes Katrina and Rita. As of Dec. 16, individuals, corporations, and foundations in the U.S. had contributed a com- bined total of more than $3.1 billion to hurricane relief efforts since Katrina struck the Gulf Coast on Aug. 29, according to data from the Center on Philanthropy at Indiana University. That dwarfs the nearly $1.9 billion Ameri- cans have raised for relief efforts for the devastating tsunami that swelled from the Indian Ocean on Dec. 26, 2004. The American Red Cross raised by far the most money for Katrina and Rita relief efforts - $1.85 billion, or about 59% of the total. Wayne Brennessel, executive director of the American Red Cross of Central Texas, said his chapter has sent $6.2 million to the organization’s national office to help pay for the cost of the Gulf storms. “Certainly beats the tsunami,” said Brennessel of the total. He said his chapter raised $1.2 million in the tsunami’s aftermath. - C.S. Even with the odds in his favor to win the governor’s race in November, GOP Gov. Rick Perry pulled just 40% of the statewide vote in the latest pulse taken by Rasmussen Reports, a public opinion research firm. The poll showed independent challenger Carole Keeton Strayhorn earning 21%, fol- lowed by Democrat Chris Bell with 14%, and independent Kinky Friedman with 12%. Rasmussen Reports concluded that Perry is in no better shape today than he was when state Comptroller Strayhorn was running as a Republican. Strayhorn declared her independence Jan. 2. The polling firm will include Democratic candidate and former Supreme Court Justice Bob Gammage in its next poll. A separate survey of voters showed U.S. Sen. Kay Bailey Hutchison, R-Texas, with a comfortable 65% lead over Democratic challenger Barbara Ann Radnofsky, who netted 25%. - Amy Smith In other governor’s race news, the Texas State Teachers Association broke from tradition this week and endorsed its first Republican candidate for statewide office - former schoolteacher and gubernatorial hopeful Carole Keeton Strayhorn. The state comptroller is running as an indepen- dent in her bid to unseat Gov. Rick Perry in November. The teachers’ group, the state affiliate of the National Education Association, said Strayhorn’s passion for public education was the overriding factor in its decision to back her. It helps that Strayhorn has also reversed herself on a past posi- tion she took in advocating state-funded private school vouchers. “Texas schoolchildren and teachers need a governor who can forge a bipartisan education funding plan,” said TSTA President Donna New Haschke. “We have given the current leadership three years to get the job done and they have failed.” - A.S. The Texas Court of Criminal Appeals has rejected U.S. Rep. Tom DeLay’s request to have felony charges against him dismissed or remanded to a lower court for a speedy trial. The state’s highest criminal court denied the appeal Monday without comment, just two days after DeLay announced he would not attempt to regain his post as House majority leader. DeLay and two associates, John Colyandro and Jim Ellis, face money-laundering charges in connection with their efforts to ensure a Republican sweep in the 2002 legislative races. Travis Co. prosecutors accuse the three of funneling $190,000 in corporate dollars through the Republican National Committee to the campaigns of seven GOP legislative candidates, including former Austin Reps. Todd Baxter and Jack Stick. - A.S. On Jan. 4, the investigator hired to lead the independent probe into the workings of the beleaguered Houston Police Department Crime Lab released his fourth report detailing findings based on 1,100 case reviews. In the 82-page report, investigator Michael R. Bromwich, a former inspector general for the U.S. Department of Justice, writes that his team found “severe and pervasive problems” with serology and DNA profiling work dur- ing the entire 15-year time frame he was hired to review. So far, the probe has uncovered “major issues” in over 40% of the DNA cases the lab reviewed in the Nineties and early 2000s, “including significant deficiencies” in DNA analyses in the cases of death row inmates Franklin Dewayne Alix, Juan Carlos Alvarez, and Gilmar Alex Guevara. (None of the three have been executed.) Bromwich also reports that several analysts failed to “report reli- able and potentially exculpatory DNA typing results and instead reported questionable ... results that inculpated the suspect,” and that the lab failed to use “proper controls” to guard against contamination. On a brighter note, Bromwich reported finding “some very competent and high quality work” within the lab’s firearms, toxicology, and questioned documents sections. So far, Bromwich’s team has examined about 40% of the cases the lab worked between 1987 and 2002, leaving about 1,600 cases to review.

San Antonio millionaire James Leininger, the oft-mentioned but seldom-seen contributor to pro-voucher candidates, put in an appearance at the Texas Public Policy Foundation’s Policy Orientation this week. Leininger, who told reporters after his speech that he would continue supporting pro-vouch- er candidates, told the group of his own early efforts to provide private and parochial school vouchers to low-income children in San Antonio. He said it is both immoral and unjust to force children to attend public schools in situ- ations where they are physically or mentally abused, and that providing low- income families with vouchers gives them the same options that upper-mid- dle income families have. The school choice panel at the forum also includ- ed lobbyist Brock Gregg of the Association of Texas Professional Educators and Railroad Commissioner Michael L. Williams. - Kimberly Reeves Mexia’s most famous daughter, Anna Nicole Smith, got a little unexpected support from the Bush administration, which filed a brief on Smith’s behalf with the U.S. Supreme Court, where Smith’s long-simmering battle to secure a sizable portion of her late husband’s fortune is slated to take center stage Feb. 28. At issue - and what has earned the interest of the administration - is whether the federal courts have jurisdiction to consider a claim on a will while it is already under consideration in state probate court. A federal court in California considered and awarded Smith an $89-million judgment on the estate of her deceased husband, Texas oil tycoon J. Howard Marshall II, while a challenge to her claims, made by Marshall’s son, was already being considered by a Texas probate court. The 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals overturned the decision, arguing that the federal courts lacked jurisdiction over the matter. The Bush administration has weighed in, arguing that the Supremes should protect the feds’ jurisdiction rights in such matters. The high court has yet to rule on whether the federal solicitor will be allowed to argue its position during next month’s oral arguments. -J.S.

NEXT MONTH: Tuesday, February 21, 2006 Gail Caldwell A Strong West Wind www.texasmonthly.com/authorseries ItaafAMili JANUARY 13, 2006 | THE AUSTIN CHRONICLE | 17 news To Bond, or Not to Bond? Despite the newly unanswered questions hanging over the Great Bond Election of 2006 - like, when’s the damn thing scheduled, May or November? - the Bond Election Advisory Committee’s work is done. Monday night, the committee stuck to its guns, formally endors- ing the same $614.8 million package it draft- ed in November, including $67.5 million for affordable housing, $92.3 million for open space, and a hard-fought $90 million for a central library. Cut, in the end, were last-minute proposals for dealing with the package’s late-gestation problem child - State Highway 130, the 49- mile tollway development east of the city, expected to drive much regional growth in the Proposed COA Bond Package Facilities Drainage Transportation Open Space New Central Library Affordable Housing Total $144.0 million 122.1 million 98.9 million 92.3 million 90.0 million 67.5 million $614.8 million next decade. Highway-related projects had not been on the committee’s radar until Mayor Wynn sounded a sudden alarm for that effort - without suggesting that the $600 million overall target should be expanded. With the proposal due at council this month, the com- mittee was abruptly faced with a late-inning substitution. “I’m kinda out of line in this,’’ said David Sullivan, veteran of 1998’s bond process, “trying to introduce this in this late stage. But I’m duty-bound to make this recommendation.” Sullivan’s apologetic suggestion, which came during last week’s final meeting of the public outreach subcommittee, was to ask the coun- cil to shovel an additional $200 million in gen- eral revenue bonds (repaid from city operating funds) on top of the committee’s $614.8 mil- lion in general obligation bonds (repaid from property taxes) for dealing with SH 130. Calling the $200 million figure simply a place- holder, Sullivan backed away from the number, instead contemplating language instructing the city manager simply to examine the possi- bility of revenue bonding. But that alternative was also abandoned, when Sullivan learned the city has “moved away” from revenue bonding. Still, the proposals illustrated the committee’s unease in trying to balance its charge of providing for 130 without any addi- tional funds for the purpose - especially after everything else in the package has already been spoken for, many times over. The initial City Council resolution calling for the bond election says it should be designed in “common to those goals identified by Envision Central Texas,” the umbrella orga- nization assembled to guide regional develop- ment. But the BE AC began work before the conclusion of the SH 130 planning process, so even ECT’s stalwart supporters have been frustrated. Committee Member Robin Rather is on ECT’s board of directors and executive committee, yet at the final BEAC discussion, she said the bond committee has received “no specific plan ... no backup” on 130. With 130’s specific needs so nebulous - and other projects made concrete by hundreds of speak- ers - in its final days the committee scram- bled for ways to preserve the overall package while providing wiggle room for 130. An out- line of the final report says as much, noting that while SH 130 investment is needed, “the lack of detailed proposals to date, and the resulting lack of vetting/consideration by the community, highlights the amount of work still needing to be done to bring any such package to fruition.” What’s to blame for the discordant climax? Probably the conflict between the council’s lofty planning goals and the pragmatic nuts and bolts requested by city staff. Despite the mayor’s request that the bond proposal be informed by ECT goals, the committee’s explicit template began with City Manager Toby Futrell’s “needs assessment” - very heavy on city infrastructure, light on 130 rec- ommendations, and knee-deep in workaday items of uncertain import to a bond election, like HVAC repairs and roof replacements for ailing buildings - undertakings normally paid for directly out of the city’s general revenue. And when public hearings commenced, the committee wasn’t exactly overwhelmed by 130 boosters; of the hundreds of speakers, there was a sole mayoral echo on behalf of 130 - a spokesman from the Chamber of Commerce, who grudgingly acknowledged that he had no specific projects to recommend. That’s not to say the committee will recom- mend nothing concerning 130. According to Sullivan, funds for creek protection, affordable housing, and $20 million of the open space recommendation apply to SH 130 neighbor- hoods. However, all of the $66 million allocat- ed directly to roads will fund reconstruction, and none applies to 130-related roads (e.g., expanding MLK eastward). Sullivan said he has “some trepidation” that when the council looks for funds for 130, it will be other road projects feeling the axe. Alternate forms of SH 130 financing might be considered - per- haps tax increment financing, under an amendment to 1997’s SB 370, from Austin Sen. Gonzalo Barrientos (“The language essentially points at SH 130,” said Barrientos aide Graham Keever). The funds will have to come from somewhere - else - if the bulk of the committee’s recommendations are to sur- vive at council, which is scheduled to take them up Jan. 26. - Wells Dunbar BONDS FOR BIKES The bike racks at City Hall were full last Thursday night for the final public meeting of the Citizen’s Bond Election Advisory Committee, the cycles’ owners in search of big-time cash to fund a series of ambitious on- and off-road bicycle infrastructure proj- ects. This week, however, as the committee finalized its recommendations, cyclists learned that while none of the $2 million in funds recommended for bikeways was cut, they will receive none of the $18 million in extra funds requested Thursday by groups such as the Texas Bike Coalition, the Aus- tin Cycling Association, and Austin Metro Trails and Greenways. The additional dough was intended to fund projects such as trails and bike facilities along the new SH 130 toll road, extending the slow-to-be-built Lance Armstrong Bike- way beyond the city limits all the way to Manor, installing the long-postponed Town Lake Boardwalk, which would bridge a gap in the waterfront trail east of the American- Statesman to the youth hostel, plus the Southwest Greenbelt trail, designed to run from Barton Springs to the Ladybird Johnson Wildflower Center. Committee member and bike commuter David Sullivan said cycling advocates simply rolled out the high-dollar requests too late in the game. As community outreach Chair (and former Chronicle City editor) Mike Clark- Madison pointed out at Thursday’s meeting, GET IT WHILE IT'S GREEN Austin Energy customers calling to sign up for the utility’s GreenChoice program have been out of luck lately, being told that the 100 % renewable energy service is sold out and to try back in a few weeks. Actually, that’s not completely accurate - the current batch of wind-generated energy, precontracted in fixed 10-year increments, is nearing its end, but enough supply actually remains for an esti- mated 1,500 residential customers and 200 businesses. And now AE, as spotlighted in a City Hall press conference Wednesday, will hold a raffle for the remaining GreenChoice subscriptions - whose 10-year fixed rate, fol- lowing a fuel charge hike this month, is actu- ally cheaper than AE’s conventionally generat- ed energy. “We believe this is the first time since coal initiated the industrial revolution in the 1700s that, side by side, wind and solar power has come out cheaper than coal,” said Council Member Brewster McCracken, who is coor- dinating the GreenChoice remodel and PR push. Beginning this week, there will be appli- cation cards all over Austin to enter the raffle, which will remain open through the end of February, McCracken said, with the drawing expected in March. McCracken said the raffle will “build public awareness across the state and the nation that investment in clean energy is paying off since it’s now cheaper than coal, gas, and nuke power,” while serving as a waiting list to gauge how much more wind power Austin Energy should contract. Andrew Donoho, a member of the city’s Resource Management Commission, which reviews water and energy conservation issues, sharply disagrees with this process, noting that all four installments of GreenChoice since its inception in 2000 have sold out. “Austin Energy is not being aggressive in bringing in more GreenChoice energy. They’ve got demand they’re not satisfying,” he said. “Austin Energy is run by brown power [fos- sil fuels] executives,” he said, which led the utility to embrace natural gas, the price of which has risen faster than any other energy source. He faulted City Council for “under- managing” the utility, allowing its executives to make “long-term political decisions ... as to what kind of fuel we use, that will have 20- to-50-year cost structure implications.” Such decisions should be a matter of public debate, he said, and suggested that AE look to coast- al wind farms now being developed, capable of producing steady energy at hot midday peak times, unlike West Texas wind farms, which produce most energy on cold nights. McCracken described two competing strategies regarding GreenChoice: Both hold that the program is better than consuming coal or gas energy, but one favors “keeping it quiet” because the supply isn’t there, while the other advocates “making people aware because with consumer pressure, there is more desire to create supply.” He acknowl- edged that Austin’s desire for green energy is not being met. “GreenChoice is a good eco- nomic bet, and we need to be investing more, but there is not enough supply to satisfy demand.” Offshore wind farms For those who demand clean energy, but simply can’t wait until March for electricity, AE spokesman Ed Clark said new and existing conventional accounts can be transferred to GreenChoice with a simple phone call. Once the last of the current batch of GreenChoice energy is raffled off, he said, a new batch will follow in the coming months - but, as in all previous offerings, the 10-year fixed energy rate likely will initially be more costly than the utility’s brown power. - Daniel Mottola 18 I THE AUSTIN CHRONICLE I JANUARY 13, 2006 any funding increases at this point would have to be subtracted from another area. “Everyone respects everyone else’s turf and everyone realizes that sacrifices have been made,” Sullivan said. Cyclists should take comfort in the fact that no bikeway funds were cut, he said - of the six transportation subcategories, bikeways and sidewalks were the only two to escape a trimming. Sullivan said $10 million remains from 2000 bonds for bikeways - $4 million is still earmarked for the (maybe posthumous at this rate) Lance Armstrong Bikeway, and at least $4 million for trails is included in the open spaces category of this bond package’s recommendations. Speaking on behalf of the 1,500-member Austin Cycling Association, Preston Tyree reminded the commissioners of the difference between affordable housing - one of the night’s oft-discussed bond items - and affordable living, in which he said there are easy ways to get where one needs to go with- out depending heavily on a car. The added funds, he said, were needed to unify roadway money designated for bike lane striping, fed- eral transportation funds for bike facilities, and for the vast connectivity and tourism pos- sibilities that the SH 130 trails and Lance Armstrong Bikeway extension hold. Texas Bike Coalition Executive Director Robin Stallings brought the vision of the lat- ter two projects home, saying towns including Georgetown, Hutto, Pflugerville, and Round Rock are eager and ready to link up to SH 130 bike paths, and pointing to an Envision Central Texas survey where 70% of respon- dents favored safe bike facilities. He also suggested that the city take a fresh look at its bike and trail plan and prioritize bike proj- ect phasing, “to get the most people on bikes and out of cars the fastest,” the “most cost- effective way to relieve congestion.” City of Austin Bike Program Coordinator Colly Kreidler said a bike plan review is under way. More than 18 miles of new bike lanes have been recently completed, but more funds are needed to review areas that weren’t part of Austin when the bike plan was adopted in 1996, as well as to implement new facilities where possible, Kreidler said. Chris Symmank, a bike mechanic and bicycle commuting and maintenance teacher at REI, asked for improvements to offer safe transitions across main arterial roads like Highway 183, Loop 360, and 1-35, which he called “a real dare to cross.” Symmank fondly recalled the bikeways of Davis and Sacramento, Calif., which include striped, bike-only two-lane roads with separate traffic lights, turn lanes, and banked turns. As evidence of the demand for bike facilities, he said hundreds of people have come into his North Austin shop inter- ested in bicycle commuting - which, he added, is a great stress reducer. - Daniel Mottola RATHER VISITS, WEIGHS IN ON LOCAL AMD DEBATE Iconic TV anchor Dan Rather waded into the debate over Advanced Micro Devices’ pro- posed development plans Monday night, expressing his love for Barton Springs in a speech sponsored by the microchip company. “If anybody thinks that by speaking here I’m endorsing AMD, let me make it clear that I am not,” the native Texan told the audience at the Paramount Theatre. A handful of protesters carried signs and dis- tributed leaflets outside the event, the first installment of public broadcasting affiliate KLRU’s Engaging Speaker Series, which was “presented” by AMD (and co-sponsored by The Austin Chronicle). Perky AMD employees dressed in polo-shirt uniforms manned the doors and a state trooper was stationed in the lobby. Before the talk, a video montage of Rather’s career was followed by a PowerPoint slide show assuring the audience, over and over again, that AMD is an “active and responsible corporate citizen,” amid photos of happy and smiling polo-shirt clad suburban-bots. Rather was introduced by AMD marketing vice-president John Volkmann, who used the term “thought leaders.” Although it apparently didn’t bother KLRU management, Rather was clearly uncomfortable with the degree of AMD’s role in the event, delaying the start of his talk on media issues to separate himself from the company. While he stopped short of criticizing AMD’s plan to build its corporate campus over the Edwards Aquifer, he said he hoped the two sides would find “common ground in protecting natural resources,” and appeared to choke up talking about the time he spends at Barton Springs with his family. “We love Barton Springs and the aquifer, and we take it seriously,” he said, drawing applause from the audience. Rather, 74, appeared close to tears at several points during the talk. Early on he grew emo- tional discussing the troops serving in Iraq, asking the audience for a few seconds of silence to honor their sacrifice. The bulk of his talk was a boilerplate call for better journalism stan- dards and more international coverage. Although he carefully avoided specifics, he said the news industry, in general, “needs a spinal transplant.” One thing Rather was not going to discuss: the much-debated 60 Minutes piece on President Bush’s National Guard service, which left a dark cloud over his departure from the anchor desk. Asked if producer Mary Mapes “took a hit” for him, he grew testy. “No, and I didn’t take one for her,” he said. And he made it clear that he wasn’t going to talk about the story further. “I’ve moved forward,” he said. - Kevin Brass At a speech on media issues sponsored by Advanced Micro Devices, former CBS News anchor Dan Rather explicitly distanced himself from AMD's decision to relocate over the Edwards Aquifer. 1 cn IY-W IDEI IRf IG ESA [LI E@ AusSfs Largest Antique, Coletfljte md Vintage Flea IVtaket www.citywideg3r3gespie.com Palmer Event Ctr - Austin Barton Springs @ Bouldin Ave ANTIQUES PRIMITIVES SHABBY CHIC DEPRESSION GLASS ADVERTISING MEMORABILIA CHINA TEXAS COLLECTIBLES FISHING LORES AMERICANA MILITARIA Sign up on our web site for email updates and $1 off Admission Coupons! www.cw^.cant BOOKS FI CHINTZ MAJOLICA FIFE.

Dice! Mix! Puree! On Thursday the Austin ISD board of trustees grappled with the proper recipe for high school success, the latest step of a multiyear process known as high school redesign. Redesign, or breaking large high schools into “educational condomin- iums” of autonomous schools-within-schools, is the Big Idea in the educational policy world - for evidence, one need only view the consul- tant-studded attendance list of the meeting, and the sweet aroma of a $1.5 million rede- sign grant from the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation that now permeates AISD. Already a year into the discussion, each AISD high school will this spring develop a plan to help transform Austin’s high school landscape from 11 comprehensive schools into a “portfolio” of these specialized small learning communi- ties (SLCs). (The basic recipe is on display at Johnston High, which this fall rearranged itself into humanities, science, and business academies of a few hundred kids each.) However, what the discussion showed was that the high- profile, much-wonked-about business of school- slicing and academy-launching can’t work with- out addressing harder issues of equity. “You can’t simply say, ‘We want to take this school and chop it into four parts because that’s what Gates gave us money to do,”’ said Steve Phillips, a redesign expert from Brooklyn College. “That will work for five years and Gates will think his money was well spent until he gets to year six.” The idea behind SLCs is that a 300-student academy focused on, say, science allows a sci- ence-loving kid to better know her peers and teachers, which in turn helps her care about linear equations and Washington crossing the Delaware. It has another potential as well: If every high school in AISD becomes, in effect, a confederation of specialized academies, it could help AISD achieve the long-elusive goal of diverse campuses. “If there’s a system that’s always routing all your lowest performing kids to one place, this is a chance to do something different,” said Phillips. “We do know that when they’re in a more heteroge- neous environment, there’s more of a chance that more of them will do better.” According to Texas Education Agency data, low-income students at high-performing schools like Anderson and Bowie lag behind their middle-class peers in the desks beside them. However, they also outperform students in schools where virtual- ly everyone is poor, showing that heterogeneity does matter. AISD as a whole demonstrates this phenomenon: A recent National Assessment of Educational Progress study showed AISD stu- dents outperforming their urban peers, even when you break the numbers down by race and class - AISD’s poor students beat other poor students, AISD’s black stu- dents beat other black students, and so on. While good teachers and curricula were at the root of this success, the fact that AISD and the other top-perform- ing district in the study - Charlotte, N.C. - are “only” about half poor (compared to upward of 80% and 90% in other urban districts) also play a role. It’s a delicate balance, however - as trustee John Fitzpatrick pointed out at Thursday’s meeting, AISD must serve both a low-income populations and middle-class families who can and do bail for private, charter, or suburban schools that offer, among other things, less diversity. In the 2004-05 school year, AISD had 6,957 kindergarteners but only 5,451 eighth- graders. This isn’t just “white flight”: As LBJ High principal Patrick Patterson pointed out, black middle-class families leave for Pflugerville or Manor, and Trustee Cheryl Bradley added that motivated low-income parents transfer their kids away from Reagan. As AISD tries to develop academies that will convince more of these families to stay, it will have to find a way to deal with the reputation and buzz that says there are certain schools to which good stu- dents do not go. This is a concern voiced by Johnston director Celina Estrada-Russell, who this fall launched her redesigned campus, replete with snazzy new academies, excited teachers, and scores of community partners, only to see many of the most committed fami- lies continue to transfer their students away. “We have an intelligence flight,” she said. “A talent flight. We have 13 students in the band.” The portfolio idea, then, could be an oppor- tunity to ditch some of the names many AISD parents now indelibly associate with failure and violence: Instead of one big Reagan High (for example), or even three mini-Reagans, AISD could have three all-new academies hosted in the building formerly known as Reagan. Imple- menting the portfolio vision across the district, however, will be complicated by neighborhood loyalty and memories of failed experiments in magnet programs, plus the fact that those schools that are already performing well simply don’t feel change is needed. “The community views the school as suc- cessful and it is, for most kids on most days,” said interim Bowie High principal Carol Mills McKenzie. “It’s very difficult to make change in an organization that views itself as very, very good.” So far, AISD has set nothing in stone, so ideas about portfolios, academies, mixing, and match- ing is all tentative. AISD strongly encourages the community to join in the discussion (among other reasons, because AISD needs to demon- strate its commitment to community engage- ment to the Gates Foundation to get more money). The issues promise to be difficult, and the discussion at times tense, but those who care about public education will no doubt agree with MacKenzie’s final word on the subject. “It is better to struggle with a sick jackass,” she told the trustees, “than to carry that wood yourself.” - Rachel Proctor May THE LEARNIN' CALENDAR Should the 2006-07 school year begin on Aug. 15 or Aug. 21? The AISD board of trustees has to decide, and has been busily soliciting public input on the matter. According to state law, school cannot start earlier than the week in which Aug. 21 falls unless the district gets a waiver from the Texas Education Agency. Most Texas districts ignore the law and start mid-August, however - last year, about three in four Texas districts received waivers and sent students back to school as early as Aug. 1. A committee of parents, teachers, and administrators will make a final recom- mendation for the trustees, who will vote on Jan. 23. The committee appears to be leaning toward the earlier start. At a recent hearing, however, about a dozen parents showed up to testify vigorously in favor of a later start date. The parents bemoaned the annoyance of winter break starting 10 days before Christmas. They bewailed the health hazards of sending kids back to school (or band practice) in mid-August when the asphalt is a-sizzlin’, and pointed out that those hot summer days also drive up the district’s air-condi- tioning costs. The parents said a later start could be achieved if the district got rid of some of the teacher development days that translate into three-day week- ends for students, which they said creat- ed child-care hardships for working par- ents, anyway. The parents also expressed concern that the district hadn’t made enough of an effort to make sure parents knew about the hearing. “How much is our opinion really, really wanted?” asked Lila Levinson, who has students at Austin High and Fulmore Middle School. An earlier start has advantages as well: Because so many districts start school early, a later start puts students at a bit of a disadvantage in their football games and standardized tests. An early start enables the district to end the first semester before winter break, and because it corresponds better with col- lege schedules, it makes it easier for teachers to beef up their qualifications over the summer.
