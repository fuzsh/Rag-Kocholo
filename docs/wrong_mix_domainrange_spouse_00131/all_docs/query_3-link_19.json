This breaks the heart of those who recall the youthful exuberance with which it was begun by a handful of UT students. Alas, Eric Hoffer described the route BOR has traveled when he wrote that “Every great cause begins as a movement, becomes a business and eventually degenerates into a racket.” Dave Shapiro [Editor’s note: Hoffer’s quote is actually , “Up to now, America has not been a good milieu for the rise of a mass movement. What starts out here as a mass movement ends up as a racket , a cult, or a corporation,\" but is often misquoted as, “Every great cause begins as a movement, becomes a business, and eventually degenerates into a racket.\"] DISMAYED BY LETTER ON DISTRICTS Dear Editor, I read the letter by professor L. Scott Walker [“Postmarks,” April 6] about why Austin needs single-member districts so that he can get more attention to striping and other traffic issues on 620 and 2222. Of course, these are state roads and not under city control.

I’m undecided about the merits of moving to a single-member system. I like the idea that all the council members should be responsive to and care about the concerns of every Austinite. Under a ward system I think that kind of respon- siveness will disappear. More importantly, after looking at voting turnout in council elections, it’s clear that our biggest problem is a simple lack of voter participation. There may be no better illustration of the potential problems with a ward system than his letter, which reeks of the senti- ment “take care of my issues and to hell with everybody else.” Andy Homer Reader comment On author James Hillman: “Just to prove how far I have strayed I didn’t know James Hillman had passed away until today. I have all of his books and once he wrote me a courteous and wise reply to my won- derings about which direction I should point myself at a crossroads of my life. And Hillman brought me to your work, Michael [Ventura], loved “Letters at 3AM.” Hard to say ‘rest in peace’ as I think he would not appreciate that, Regarding charging more for Downtown parking: \"It’s actually quite easy to estimate those costs. Two weeks ago I was considering where to go eat dinner. I decided to go to Easy Tiger on Sixth Street. Thanks to non-free parking I was able to get a parking space right outside the front door and paid $1.75. \"In the past I would never have attempted to go Downtown (especially to Sixth Street) and eat on a Friday night. And there’s no way I would have gotten a free parking space because someone would have gotten the space at 3pm, gotten blitzed, taken a taxi home, and kept the space until 2pm the next day. \"So the real economic cost is that if that park- ing space hadn’t been there Easy Tiger wouldn’t have made $40 from me. And they wouldn’t have made $40 from the person who came after me. Multiply that by all the other spaces in the city. \"Free parking allows people to park forever which makes it harder to park at a business - which hurts businesses. \"This is at most only tangentially related to the environment. It is directly related to businesses getting customers in their doors.” - Tim Thomas “Point Austin: ‘Free’ Is Much Too Expensive,” News, April 6 austinchronicle.com/comments WHAT IF SIDEWALKS WERE FINISHED? Dear Editor, When I was a child visiting my grandmother in Austin, I had the privilege, for the first time in my life, of walking by myself to the grocery store on the sidewalk. It was really great. I thought of Austin as a magic place where children could go places by themselves. It turns out that my experience was rare. Most children in Austin never walk anywhere, whether alone or otherwise. Three-fourths of Austin’s curbside miles lack sidewalks.

Why do our leaders insist on building rail sys- tems before building the sidewalks necessary to make public transit work? Why can we afford much more costly biomass plants, dysfunctional rail lines, race-car tracks, and highways, but never a complete sidewalk system? A fellow pedestrian says it’s because the offi- cials entrusted with city infrastructure are inter- ested mainly in padding their resumes. These aren’t imaginative people. They think that a big highway cutting through the city like a wound is a glorious resume-building tool. And they see side- walks as insignificant, unworthy of their talents. What if we actually finished Austin’s sidewalk system in 10 years? (City leaders will say that’s impossible; only biomass plants and highways can be built quickly.) If seen and built as a single project instead of two thousand tiny ones, a com- plete sidewalk system would transform Austin, turning it into the kind of city people want it to be: friendly, peaceful, egalitarian, affordable. A complete sidewalk system would solve so many problems at once. Yet our leaders never even mention it. Shall we go on paying people to ruin our city to pad their resumes? Or could we perhaps start insisting that Austin’s sidewalk system be fin- ished in 10 years? Yours Truly , Amy Babich APOLOGY FOR REMARKS Dear Editor, The March 23 issue of the Chronicle included an article entitled “IDEA Still Hunting Enrollment” [News]. In the article, Vince Tovar from the group PRIDE of the Eastside was quoted on several points that indicate opposition to the IDEA char- ter school at Allan Elementary. Mr. Tovar is an employee of Austin Voices for Education and Youth and made these remarks in a setting that he thought was off the record. However, as an employee of Austin Voices, he should not have made these remarks, and they are not representative of Austin Voices. Currently, Austin Voices is working with commu- nities around Eastside Memorial and three other continued on p.10 Kinda risky though.

MOONTOWERCOMEDYFESTIVAL.COM OONTOWER COMEDY & ODDITY FESI austinchronicle.com APRIL13,2012 the Austin chronicle 9 continued from p.7 vertical team campuses on strengthening their campus plans. Our goal is to be a neutral facilita- tor of community and school voice. We believe that there is tremendous strength in these communi- ties and that, working together with the district, these four campuses can do great things for kids. Austin Voices apologizes for any confusion these remarks may have caused. Sincerely , Allen Weeks Executive director Austin Voices for Education and Youth CARS ARE PRIMARY MEANS OF TRANSPORTATION Dear Editor, When it comes to “the Guru of Parking” Donald Shoup’s ideas of charging more for parking as applied to Downtown Austin (\"’Free’ Is Much Too Expensive,” April 6, 2012), I would argue that this would only make those neighborhoods more insular. As a resident of North Austin, I will be less inclined to venture Downtown on a weeknight to the Violet Crown or to the farmers’ market on South Congress on a weekend when I can simply park for free at the Arbor Cinema or the north Whole Foods locations. (And the alternatives are only increasing.) Initially, that may sound great for the Downtown residents who would rather have fewer people around. But how many of those businesses that currently pro- vide tasty treats and cool things to do will still exist Downtown if you reduce the customer base? Mr. Shoup’s second “policy prescription” - using the revenue for the “immediate commer- cial or residential neighborhood (as walkable spaces)” - only worsens the situation. If the revenue is not devoted to Austin-wide public transportation, then how does he expect to realize his “major corollary”? Adequate public transportation is necessary for all this to work. To be frank, I am as skeptical of the notion that if you charge for parking, public transportation will come as I am of trickle-down economics. The fact is that cars are far and away our pri- mary means of transportation, and public trans- portation in Austin is not even close to being a competitive alternative for most residents of a city of this geographic size. This is not New York City, or even Portland, Ore., for that matter. If the residents and businesses of Downtown Austin are intent on diminishing the number of in-town visitors, then by all means, raise the parking rates. But just as free is never really free, the demand curve always slopes downward. Steven Baker THANKS FOR THE MOSERS! Dear Editor, Thank you for having such wonderful writers as the Mosers on your staff. I treasure their candor, and the artful way they describe events. Thank you. Lucy Gunter THANK YOU, STYLE AVATAR Dear Editor, Even though I know and care very little about style and fashion, I’ve long been a fan of Stephen Moser’s delightfully descriptive and sometimes outrageous writing in “After a Fashion.” In the last year or so, I have especially appre- ciated Stephen’s unabashed sharing of his experiences with cancer. If I ever have cancer, I would want to use him as a model for how to deal with it in public. Thank you, Stephen, for continuing to be our Style Avatar in spite of your physical challenges.

As I have just returned home from a week in Austin, let me repay the appreciation I have for the city with a hearty recommend of this film.” - Brad Hinton Film Listings , April 6 austinchronicle.com/comments VOTING IS A RIGHT RESERVED FOR LEGAL AMERICAN CITIZENS Dear Editor, One important principle on which our American democracy was founded is that prin- ciple in which voting is a right reserved for legal American citizens. We should protect this prin- ciple - this principle should grow some teeth by passing the law requiring ID to vote. A proper identification requirement would reduce or omit voting by non-Americans, unregistered voters, and other voter fraud. The argument that a voter ID requirement is a party maneuver to deny voter rights is a mis- guided notion. And fatuous. Most honest voters have state-issued driver’s licenses or ID cards. Besides that, we have to use such in almost every area of our lives. If a police officer pulls someone aside for identifica- tion, that person could face going to jail if they cannot prove who they are. For those who wish to be legal but need help to get identification - there is help available! Churches and other charitable entities will supply vouchers for ID fees, as well as social workers if needed to acquire birth certificates or other documents that are prerequisites to obtaining ID. Charitable agencies are aware that daily life and the law dictate the need for IDs and that the homeless, working poor, and the disabled rely on them to that end. For those who need help to get ID - call 211 or Travis County Health & Fluman Services at 854-3743. Thank you, Lisa Fry (Sharpe) DOESN'T TRUST U.S. CENSUS Dear Editor, The U.S. census is taken every 10 years, the last in 2010. I got a long form from them last month. A friend who worked for the Census Bureau in 2005 informed me that Austin is a test market area and random people are selected every month of every year. The third time they called me on the phone, the man said he had “15 minutes” of questions for me. I told him that according to the U.S. Constitution, all they needed was a head count. I have received letters and calls from them telling me that according to Title 13 of the U.S. Code, I must answer. I no longer answer the phone. I know the Founding Fathers of our country would never have agreed to this. My civil disobedience is an act of conscience. My ex-U.S. census worker friend tells me they will arrest me for not answering the personal questions on the U.S. census form. They already had my address and phone number. I told them one person lives here. Hopefully they won’t arrest me, but I cannot cooperate with such an invasion of my privacy. The U.S. Constitution grants me privacy. They are trying to get me to comply from fear of arrest. I would like to know what Austin Chronicle readers have to say. The U.S. Census Bureau keeps telling me all information I give them will remain confidential. Oh, really? They used the census data in the 1940s to round up Japanese for internment camps - and back then, they claimed it was confidential, too. Maybe now they would share it with cor- porations. Or FEMA. Or who knows. I don’t trust them. Michele Deradune CHEM TRAILS SHOULD BE EXAMINED Dear Editor, Since Michael King brought up chem trails in the same breath as the fluoride issue [“Zoning, Fluoride, and Old Hollywood,” News, April 6], might he risk a few “conspiracy-theorist” or “wing-nut” epithets (the new “reds”?) and take an earnest look at the subject? Or try a few laps on your back in Barton Springs on a bright, blue day and watch those jet “con” trails crisscrossing the sky in tic-tac-toe formation. Notice that they don’t dissipate for a few hours? This anomaly alone should at least nudge the intellectual curiosity of a true muckrak- ing journalist.

Open Questions Campaign questionnaires offer a window into the city’s political obsessions Artists should work for free. That’s one curious conclusion one might come to by reading City Council campaign questionnaires, a preoccupation I pursued over the last couple of weeks while attending campaign forums that sometimes felt like a political version of speed dating. ^ Although there’s no stan- dardized procedure for the dozens of public forums leading up to the May 12 election, several of the more prominent groups (and a few of the less promi- nent) submit advance questionnaires to the can- didates, who return their answers prior to the forum. With any luck, the groups also post the answers to their websites, so vot- ers (and obsessives like me) can seek them out for more detail about the candidates’ positions than, say, “Cut the budget!” or “More money for roads!” It was on such a questionnaire that I learned, for example, that Austin artists should see it as their responsibility to bal- ance the city budget. In fairness, only a cou- ple of Place 5 candidates - John E Duffy and Audrey “Tina” Cannon - sug- gested this strategy for saving city funds, but it caught my eye because it’s such a com- monplace in generic bud- get discussions: “Why are we spending so much money on art?!?” Duffy suggested cutting fund- ing from the Art in Public Places program, “as this city is home to hundreds if not thousands of artists who would love to decorate the city for free if only they were allowed to.” Slightly more generous, Cannon suggested the city could have saved on the Seaholm “art wall” by “collaborating] with the local art community and put[ting] togeth- er a coalition to reduce costs and at the same time highlight local artists.” BY MICHAEL hOINf ^AUSTIN; KING “If enforced, the [Texas] rule will cause irreparable harm to ... tens of thousands of low-income women seeking family planning and other preventive health services.” -from Planned Parenthood’s lawsuit against the state, filed Tuesday Headlines > Not an intimidating City Council agenda today (Thursday), although a couple of charter revi- sion proposals (concerning campaign finance reform and council assuming direct management of its own staff) come to the floor, as do some new pedicab regulations that may raise a fuss. The brace of afternoon public hearings concern annexations of several Southeast Travis County MUDs - always a potential mudfield. And work sessions on Austin Energy rates continue, including a bravely special-called Saturday meet- ing up the suburban road in Lakeway (see “Then There’s This,” p.16). Council campaigns for the May 12 election are in full swing, with endorsement forums and relat- ed debates taking place almost every day - our own Amy Smith co-hosts a mayoral debate Sunday at Scholz Garten - and the candidates answering questions and questionnaires all over town. For an overview of the races, see “It’s Your City Council!,” p.24, and for more forum dates and times, see “Civics 101,” p.16. Two unrelated officeMnvolved shootings ended in tragedy last week - first with the police shooting death of Ahmede Jabbar Bradley, shot and killed after a struggle with a police offi- cer April 5 in East Austin (see “‘I Need Rehab Not Discipline,’” p.19), followed by the fatal shooting of APD Officer Jaime De Luna-Padron later that same night inside a North Austin Walmart (see “Officer’s Death Hits Home,” p.18). o > Next week features a couple of ceremonial dedi- | cations to local luminaries: On Thursday, April > 19, UT-Austin will dedicate a plaza to legendary o news anchor Walter Cronkite, and on Friday, IS April 20, the city and Capital Statues Inc. will o dedicate a Downtown sculpture of the Man of All z Music: Willie Nelson. > Numbers released this week by the Centers for Disease Control show that Texas has been edged out of the Top 3 for highest teen birth rate. Arkansas has taken third, pushing Texas to fourth, with 52.2 live births per 1,000 teen- age girs. Mississippi and New Mexico still lead the nation. > Federal Transit Administrator Peter Rogoff was in Austin on April 10 to announce a grant covering 80% of the cost of Capital Metro’s MetroRapid commuter system. The transit agency will receive $38 million for the new articulated bus system, due to open in 2014, plus an extra $3 million to replace older regular vehicles. Rick Santorum finally bowed out of the seem- ingly impossible race against Mitt Romney on April 10, suspending his campaign for the GOP presidential nomination. However, neither Ron Paul nor Newt Gingrich seem inclined to drop out, and both claim to be the real conser- vative option. The Republican Party of Texas may change its May 29 presidential primary rules: Chairman Steve Munisteri has joined calls to switch from a proportional allocation of delegates to winner- takes-all. Hundreds of Austin Police motorcycles and squad cars fill the parking area outside Wednesday’s funeral service for APD Officer Jaime De Luna-Padron, who was fatally shot in a North Austin Walmart last week. See “Officer’s Death Hits Home,” p. 18, and austinchronicle.com/Newsdesk, April 11. Illllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllll I’m not trying to single out these two candidates - only making the broader argu- ment that so many of our budget discus- sions seize on relatively minor expenditures or city amenities - art installations or board- walks, for example - as somehow “waste- ful.” The truth is, as a city we spend almost nothing on public art (a very selective 2% of major structures), and artists (like musi- cians, in the nominal Music Capital of The World) are routinely expected to donate their time and talents to every charitable occasion - and also to feel honored to be asked to work for nothing. A great city cel- ebrates (and commissions) great art, and incidentally profits from it - witness, for one example, Chicago’s Millennium Park, which cost too much money until it was built and is now cheap at any price. continued on p.16 austinchronicle.com APRIL13,2012 the Austin chronicle 15 I J 1 4 POINT AUSTIN continued from p.15 If a Tree Falls ... Campaign questionnaires, of course, can say as much about the questioners as about the candidates. Reading those of the Real Estate Council of Austin and the Austin Neighborhoods Council, one might conclude that the most important issue facing the city right now is the heritage tree ordinance (which regulates removal). Fresh from a symbolic battle over one Downtown tree (see Amy Smith’s “The Tree in the Way,” Oct. 21, 2011), in a rela- tively brief questionnaire RECA asked no fewer than nine questions about possible ordinance loosening. In its traditionally detailed document, the ANC asks only two heritage tree questions - essentially, wheth- er restrictions should be tighter - but it’s clear enough that the two organizations retain their effectively opposed positions. These opposing questions, which seem very specific, are in fact all about subtext and context - our ongoing public argu- ment about growth and development, how fast it should happen and at what cost, and whether there are ways to mitigate the inevitable changes to the cityscape. Without getting into great detail, the can- didates (not all of them quite so attuned to the ordinance nuances as their question- ers) run the range of responses, mostly landing somewhere in the middle: Let the ordinance work for a while, and make exceptions only when necessary. Enjoy the Ride For the record, the ANC questionnaire is much the most detailed and policy-wonk- ish, very useful for already-educated vot- ers but also heavy with the scent of recent, particular battlegrounds (e.g., the Barton Springs Road planned unit development) that may not provide precise carryover to the next zoning battle. The questionnaires also vary, obviously, with the core inter- ests of the group at hand. Partisan voting histories, for example, are carefully scruti- nized in the joint questionnaire submitted by eight Democratic clubs, who took a very dim view of the Ron Paul enthusiasts queuing up for all the council races. And the League of Bicycling Voters wanted to know which of the candidates would take part in its upcoming “Political Pedal,” the annual Downtown bike ride designed to highlight biking issues and allow min- gling of candidates and bicyclists. For the record, all that responded said they’d be there, this Friday, 4:45pm at City Hall (details at www.lobv.org/calendar) - the event starts with brief speeches, but ends with beer at Billy’s Brew & Que, so you can mingle, hear, exercise, and be rewarded. I’ve tried to provide a broader range of the candidate’s various backgrounds, experience, and specific positions - and endorsements thus far - in the overview in this issue (see “It’s Your City Council,” p.24). Please have a look, and check the organizational websites for more details and, where applicable, the questionnaires. See if they asked your favorite ques- tions. ■ Westward Hos? CITY COUNCIL TAKES ITS RATE CASE TO THE PEOPLE OF LAKEWAY This Saturday, April 14, Austin City Council members head west to the resort community of Lakeway to hear what out-of-city residents think about a proposed electric rate increase. Of course, council already knows what those residents think about the rate package - they loathe it, even with the possi- bility of a 6.1% discount on their bills. If the city does decide to grant them a rate break, Austin residents will have to make up the cost difference on their utility bills. Earlier this year, Mayor Lee Leffingwell and Mayor Pro Tern Sheryl Cole championed the idea of extending an olive branch to the suburban ratepayers. On the campaign trail, though, Leffingwell has backed far away from that initial offer, saying he may not even attend the Saturday hearing. Cole, on the other hand, seems to have embraced her new role as outreach coordinator. She said the city of Lakeway agreed to host the event because most of the concerns were coming from residents who live in communities west of Austin. “We’re looking forward to ... hear- ing from these ratepayers,” she said. “We want to listen > to their concerns and consider them as we consider what we’re going to do with [the rate case]. We want them to be part of the dialogue.” DEFINITION OF 'DISCOUNT’ On the proposed cost break, Cole said, “At this time, I don’t think anyone on council has said that they support a discount” for out-of- city ratepayers. Of course, that depends on one’s definition of discount. Austin opponents of the rate hike tend to point to Leffingwell for inviting the showdown with suburban rate- r THEN , THERE’S , THIS , * BY AMY § k SMITH . payers, an issue that could ultimately be decided by the Legislature. To be clear, Leffingwell did not specifically say that out-of-city ratepayers should get a discount on their bills when he panned the original rate package in his Jan. 15 blog post. But he did say, “I believe this is the right time to give consideration to the con- cerns of ratepayers who live outside the Aus- tin city limits, which the current proposal does not do.” He went on to say that out-of- city ratepayers don’t have the ability to vote for City Council members and that AE trans- fers a large sum of money each year to the city’s general fund to help pay for public ser- vices “that they may not directly receive.” He went on: “As we weigh a rate adjustment that would impact all customers, it’s the appropriate time to also weigh options for more fairly serving the interests of non-resident customers.” Leffingwell was roundly applauded for being the first on council to stick his neck out and criticize the initial rate proposal on several points. But he hasn’t been able to live down his suggestion that the city consider other options for those suburban residents who make up about 14% of Austin Energy’s 450,000 cus- tomers. Mayoral opponent Brigid Shea called Leffingwell’s comments “reckless,” adding that he’s contributed to laying a “big mess” of a rate case on the steps of the Texas Capitol. In any case, two weeks after the mayor’s critique of the rate case, AE General Manager Larry Weis returned to the council with a revised proposal - this one offering the 6.1% discount to non-city residents. V ONLY IN AUSTIN “I hate to think what this will do to incent wealth flight to the suburbs,” said environ- mental activist Paul Robbins of the possible rate break for non-city residents. “The theory of entitlement vanishes when you face the facts. No private utility - phone, gas, cable, private electric utility - goes without a profit outside the Austin city limits. No other large municipal utility in Texas has separate rate structures inside and outside their cities.” Cole herself acknowledges what bears repeating every time we write about electric utility rates - that a large share of non-city ratepayers regularly commute to Austin to work, and to use and enjoy many of the city’s services and amenities paid for by Austin Energy’s revenue stream. “We very much welcome the fact that they work in Austin and visit our tourist attractions and restaurants and shopping centers,” she said, adding that it’s her goal to continue building on the relation- ship with cities whose residents also benefit from everything Austin has to offer. Predictions are that things could get ugly at the Lakeway hearing because of the leg- islative threat to settle the “taxation-with- out-representation” refrain of out-of-city ratepayers. Cole says she welcomes the feedback regardless of how it’s delivered. “I live in the city of Austin; you think I’m not used to being yelled at?” she said with a hearty laugh. “I don’t think the people in the service area are capable of doing anything that I haven’t expe- rienced before - we take it on the chin all the time. I hope the Legislature recognizes that these are our customers and we’ll do our best to reach out to them.” Good luck with that. ■ Saturday’s hearing starts at 10am in the Lakeway City Council Chambers , 1102 Lohmans Crossing Rd. “I hate to think what this will do to incent wealth flight to the suburbs.” - Paul Robbins CIVICS 101 THURSDAY 12 PROPERTY TAX TOWN HALL MEETING New homeowners and longtime residents alike learn how property valuation works, plus how to protest, file exemptions and deferrals, and more. 6:30pm.

PERFORMED NIGHTLY APR 13 APR 23 APR 28 MAY 4 MAY MAY THE MAN WHO PLANTED TREES ESPERANZA SPALDING austinchronicle.com APRIL13,2012 the Austin chronicle 17 I^lml APD Chief Art Acevedo is overcome by emotion as he discusses the shooting death of Officer Jaime De Luna-Padron. Officer’s Death Hits Home Austin Police Chief Art Acevedo began to cry as he recalled how the 6-year- old daugh- ter of slain APD Officer Jaime De Luna- Padron leaned in to whisper in his ear Friday afternoon. “‘Please tell my grandpar- ents that my dad was a good man,’” he said the little girl told him. Indeed, Padron - a Marine who served in both Gulf Wars and spent 14 years with the San Angelo PD before coming to Austin in 2008 to join the airport police, and then APD after the city consolidated its policing operations - was, by all accounts, a stand-up guy. “He was a very close friend, a dedicated father,” said retired APD detective and for- mer Austin Police Association President Mike Sheffield, who recruited Padron to come to Austin. “He was an outstanding officer and a fine human being.” Rmeral services were held Wednesday. Padron was killed after responding to a call at a North Austin Walmart store around 2:20am on April 6. Store employees had called about a man - whom Acevedo identi- fied at a Friday press conference as 24-year- old Brandon Montgomery Daniel - who was acting strangely, was “possibly intoxi- cated,” Acevedo said, and was trying to shoplift from the store. When Padron arrived at the store, Daniel was trying to leave; Padron reached out for the man’s arm to stop him. “I need to speak with you,” he told Daniel, according to an arrest affidavit filed Monday morning. When Daniel “ducked his shoulder” in an attempt to get away, Padron “sternly” told him to stop. Daniel instead ran for the door; Padron tackled him from behind and the two fell to the floor. Quickly and without warning, Acevedo said, Daniel pulled a semiauto- matic pistol from his pocket and fired at Padron. Acevedo said Padron died from a bullet wound to the neck. After Daniel fired, Walmart employees Lincoln LeMere, the overnight shift super- visor, and Archie Jordy, an assistant man- ager, took action “immediately and without hesitation,” Acevedo said. They wrestled Daniel to the ground, and used Padron’ s radio to call for police. Officers arrived and tried to resuscitate Padron, but it was too late; the neck wound was fatal, and he was 18 theaustin chronicle APRIL 13, 2012 austinchronicle.com pronounced dead at the scene. It was a call for service that “appeared on the surface to be a low-risk call,” Acevedo said. “Without warning,” it turned deadly. Daniel is in custody, without bond, and has been charged with capital murder of a police officer, a death-eligible offense. Daniel worked as a software engineer at Hewlett-Packard, where he’d been employed since coming to Austin about a year ago from Colorado, where he graduated from Colorado State University in Fort Collins. Daniel was arrested by APD in February for drunk driving; that case is pending. Accord- ing to the arrest affidavit, as he was being brought into the police station for question- ing, Daniel admitted that he knew he’d killed a cop. “Daniel stated that he inten- tionally shot . . . Padron, in the region of the head,” as the officer “attempted to hinder his flight during the commission of theft.” Daniel’s mother, Mary O’Dell, told the Associated Press that her son had been depressed recently after a breakup with his longtime girlfriend. Daniel’s roommate, Kelvin Davis, told APD detectives that when the two were “hanging out” Thursday evening, Daniel mentioned that the two should “go hit a store.” Davis told police he initially thought Daniel meant the two should go grab a bite to eat; but when Daniel started wondering aloud about how much money might be in the cash registers at a local convenience store, he said he realized Daniel was talking about robbery. “I reminded Brandon that he has a DWI in Austin and a possession of marijuana charge in Tulia,” Davis told police, accord- ing to an affidavit. “Dude, I’ve gotten away with worse shit than that,” Daniel alleg- edly responded. “I run from the cops on my bike almost daily.” Davis said he went to bed around 9pm; it was the last time he saw his roommate. Padron was the first APD officer shot and killed in the line of duty since Ralph Ablanedo was gunned down in 1978; David Lee Powell was executed in 2010 for that killing. The last on-duty death occurred in 2004, when Officer Amy Donovan was acci- dentally struck by a police cruiser while she was pursuing a suspect on foot. The 100 Club of Central Texas has set up a trust for Padron’ s family, and donations can be made at any area Chase bank. Additional donations may be made to the Greater Austin Crime Commission. - Jordan Smith Rooting for Duty In the increasingly tense GOP race for Williamson County District Attorney, Jana Duty, the current WilCo county attorney who is chal- lenging incumbent D.A. John Bradley, has picked up the lion’s share of endorsements, including of the area’s law enforcement organizations. In addition to the endorsement of the WilCo and Travis County sheriffs’ associations, Duty last week racked up nods from both the Austin Police Association, and the statewide officers’ union, the Combined Law Enforcement Associations of Texas. So far, only the Round Rock Police Officers Association has thrown its support behind Bradley’s re-election bid. - J.S. LOCUS ONLY/ PROMOTION!

I r.- r |j. r _l i L li . l I ^ iSlii-ikic^ Pre^enl Friends, family, and neighbors react at the scene of last week’s police shooting of Ahmede Jabbar Bradley. ‘I Need Rehab Not Discipline’ By his own account, Ahmede Jabbar Bradley was a man troubled with drug addiction. “I been smokeing [sic] crack since I was [18],” he wrote in a letter to then-dis- trict Judge Wilford Flowers in October 2006. “Texas talks rehab. I need rehab not disci- pline. I am a habitual drug user your honor.” Indeed, at the time Bradley, then 26, wrote that letter, he was facing time for possession of crack cocaine. It was the 19th time he’d been arrested and charged with a crime - including six misdemeanor charges of pot possession, four misdemeanor charges of evading arrest, and a felony charge of pos- session of crack cocaine that netted him five years in prison, according to court records. On Thursday evening, April 5, his strug- gle came to a sad end, after he was shot and killed after fleeing from an Austin Police officer who’d pulled him over for what APD Chief Art Acevedo said Friday was a routine traffic stop in the 6000 block of Manor Road in East Austin. Acevedo would not say what triggered the stop, but said it was a routine stop by Officer Eric Copeland that started out “friendly.” Then, however, Bradley, who was alone in the vehicle, pulled away in the car, stopped again a short distance away, got out of the car, and fled on foot. It was not the first time Bradley had done such a thing: In 2009, police pulled him over after noticing an inspection sticker viola- tion, and smelled marijuana coming from his car; after he initially pulled over, Bradley took off again, abandoned his car in a near- by yard and fled on foot. In that instance, police apprehended him without incident; he was not as lucky on Thursday evening. Copeland followed on foot after Bradley took off, and the two got into two scuffles in the 5000 block of Overbrook Drive. Copeland tried to subdue Bradley with his Taser, but one of the prongs “didn’t take,” Acevedo said, and the device failed. As the pair continued to struggle, Acevedo said, Bradley pulled the cord from Copeland’s shoulder-mounted mic and tried to strangle the officer with it; Copeland was able to free himself. As the struggle continued, it also escalated; Acevedo said at least two witnesses called 911, asking police to hurry to the scene because it appeared Copeland was losing the fight. Witnesses also reported seeing Copeland and Bradley wrestling for control of Copeland’s gun. Ultimately Copeland regained control and fired several shots, striking and killing Bradley. The scene of the shooting bristled with tension, witnesses said. At one point some- one threw rocks at a patrol car, shattering the driver side window; no one was hurt. Acevedo said there’s video and audio of the stop, and recordings of multiple 911 calls describing the scene. He said the depart- ment will work to expedite the public release of both audio and video of the incident, and implored the public to withhold judgment until after the evidence is in and the record- ings have been made public. “What is most important for us, once we’ve stabilized the scene, is to investigate, so that we have the evidence” that both a grand jury and the public will need in order to determine whether the shooting was justified. Among the questions likely to be raised is whether Copeland should have pursued Bradley after pulling him over for only a minor traffic violation. The decision to pur- sue a fleeing suspect when no apparent exigent circumstances were present was among the issues raised in the 2007 shoot- ing of Kevin Brown. Sgt. Michael Olsen was terminated for that deadly encounter, in part, Acevedo concluded, because he failed to properly assess the threat and risk that Brown was armed - Olsen had been told he was carrying a gun - before deciding to go “hands-on” with Brown and then to chase him through a neighboring apartment com- plex. To what degree Copeland’s tactics and decision to chase Bradley will be an issue in this shooting remains to be seen. Acevedo said the investigation continues and that there’s “a lot of other evidence” related to the incident, but he didn’t elaborate. Copeland was taken to the hospital with a broken finger and other minor injuries; he has been placed on administrative leave with pay as the investigation continues. Acevedo extended his sympathy to Bradley’s family. “I don’t care if the person is Jeffrey Dahmer,” he said. “The pain of a mother and father is real.” - Jordan Smith ft reading by the poet Marie Howe ai^rd-wifiiiing author of The Good Thief .

Some must sting more than others. Take two -term Place 2 incumbent City Council Member Mike Martinez who, dur- ing recent weeks, has been piling up endorsements from all over the Austin political spectrum. Both the Austin police and firefighters’ associations have thrown their support behind him, as have the Austin Progressive Coalition, the Austin Tejano Democrats, the League of Bicycling Voters, the Stonewall Democrats, Central Austin Democrats, and so on. All told, no fewer than 15 organizations have endorsed the former mayor pro tern in his quest for a third term, with the election a month away. But for Martinez, who is both the chair- man of the Capital Metro Board of Directors and former head of the Austin Firefighters Association (thus familiar with the pains of both management and labor), the endorsement of his opponent, Laura Pressley, by local Amalgamated Transit Union 1091 must be particularly bruising, right? An indictment of both his managerial abilities and his devotion to organized labor? Martinez says it’s nothing of the kind. “I’m not surprised, nor am I upset,” Mar- tinez tells me. “This is a symptom of a two- decade process. It’s not personal, and it’s not based on a decision I made. This is just the end of a long process not requested by [the Cap Metro board].” In fact, Martinez most likely lost the ATU endorsement three years ago, when the union pushed for a state Sunset Review audit to get the transit authority’s financial house in order. The audit resulted in belt- tightening at the transit authority and a new union-busting state law, Senate Bill 650, requiring Cap Metro to either transi- tion its employees to a private contractor or make them direct employees of quasi-state agency Cap Metro (rather than employees of current subcontractor StarTran). Recognizing that under the public (direct employment) option, they would lose their right to strike, ATU members rejected it, and chose instead to negotiate the private- contractor route. Earlier this year, ATU and Cap Metro came up with employment core terms for such a private contract that would ensure current wages, comparable health care benefits, and other working conditions for all union workers regardless of their eventual employer. But no agreement was reached on the issue of employee pension plans until last Friday, when an indepen- dent arbitrator determined that Cap Metro is not obligated to require a new contractor be bound by any terms of the transit author- ity’s current retirement plan. According to ATU attorney Glenda Pittman, the decision is subject to appeal. And despite the arbitra- tor’s ruling, Cap Metro offered to grant one year of service to each plan participant - beyond that, ATU would be on its own in negotiating its pensions. To ATU 1091 President Jay Wyatt, that outcome simply confirms that Martinez is not interested in doing right by Cap Metro employees, and that ATU was right to endorse Pressley. (The ATU also effectively blocked a Martinez endorsement by the Central Labor Council, which abstained.) “The Cap Metro board is making up for its financial mismanagement on the backs of its workers,” Wyatt says. “We whistle-blew and they said we caused the problem. I’m not surprised at all by the arbitrator’s deci- sion. He was hand-picked by Cap Metro. If you have a stacked deck against you, are you surprised when you lose?” Wyatt says his union’s support of Pressley is genuine, but that it also reflects the gen- eral distaste membership has for Martinez. “Mike Martinez has been behind this new labor structure from the beginning,” Wyatt says. “He may say he’s a Democrat, but he looks like a Republican. It’s all a bunch of bullshit. We believe Laura Pressley is a nice lady who will do well, but this is a protest endorsement. If a dog had run against Mar- tinez, we would have endorsed that dog.” Martinez says he understands the union’s discontent, but says they need to under- stand that they brought it upon themselves - and upon the entire transit agency - when they demanded that audit in 2009. “I understand their frustration: They’re not getting what they want,” Martinez says. “But when are they going to accept respon- sibility for their involvement in this? The Sunset Commission reviewed everything about us, and we had to sit there and take it. There’s no way we would want to be dressed down in public like that. We didn’t ask for any of this. The position they’re in is at their own request.” Enrollment Stalling, IDEA Gets Magnetic Last fall, when the Austin Independent School District first proposed handing campuses over to IDEA Public Schools, it was sold to parents and trustees as a way to save the Eastside Memorial Vertical Team. Now the district argues that the IDEA Allan campus is a new tool for deal- ing with overcrowding, and teachers are becoming increas- ingly concerned that Allan will become another magnet - recruiting the best students away from their campuses. On March 19, fifth-grade students at Pickle Elementary were summoned to what was in essence an early-morning sales pitch by IDEA staff for its new in-district charter. Education Austin has called the event an “assembly,” but in an email, IDEA Senior Communications Manager Vanessa Barry said that term “is incorrect. They are fifth grade student presentations.” Whatever it might be called, the gathering raised more than a few eyebrows - especially since Pickle is a feeder elementary for Reagan, not Eastside. It now turns out this was one of 12 such student gatherings conducted so far. They’ve taken place in elementaries in the Akins, Lanier, LBJ, McCallum, Reagan, and Travis vertical teams, and IDEA has plans for up to four more. Barry explained, “The goal for the presentations is to educate students on their options for the upcoming school year and answer any questions students may have.” In the 2012-13 school year, IDEA Allan will hold first, sec- ond, and sixth graders. Families within the Allan attendance zone who do not want their children to attend the charter school had until March 9 to opt out. After that, IDEA was allowed to recruit from across the district. AISD Chief Academic Officer Ramona Trevino said that IDEA Allan is simply acting like any of the district’s magnet middle schools - Kealing, Fulmore, the Liberal Arts & Science Academy - and the Ann Richards School. As schools of choice, they get to hold recruitment events at other AISD campuses. She said, “When the board approved the in-dis- trict charter, it went into that bucket of academic options.” However, when IDEA initially made its pitch to AISD - explaining why it should be given the complete Eastside Memorial Vertical Team - the charter group said its model only works by being geographically based. Now its enroll- ment numbers are looking shaky, and it’s relying on dis- trictwide recruitment. Education Austin co-President Ken Zarifis was unimpressed by this policy switch: “They want to compare [IDEA] to Kealing, they want to compare it to LASA, so you’re saying ‘It’s a magnet.’ It’s not a magnet - it’s a neighborhood school that can’t make up its numbers.” IDEA is not planning to hit all 80 AISD elementaries in this year’s sales pitch; it’s visiting only a short list hand- picked by Trevino and AISD Chief Schools Officer Paul Cruz. The criteria is an unexpected one - overcrowding. For example, Pickle has permanent capacity to hold only 617 students, but had 740 enrolled at the start of the 2012 aca- demic year. Zarifis questioned that logic. Calling the addi- tional transportation issues (Allan is several miles southeast of Pickle) impractical, he said, “To reach out that far just seems like a desperation measure on their part, because the Eastside community has said, ‘We don’t want you.’” The timing of the Pickle meeting is also problematic. Under the timeline set out by the district, IDEA could not start taking applications from outside the Eastside Memorial vertical team until after March 30 - well after these pitch meetings started. AISD board President Mark Williams said he was not surprised that IDEA was having recruit- ment problems, especially among the youngest students. Education Austin co-President Ken Zarifis “People generally feel that their elementary schools are pretty good,” he said. The closer kids get to high school, the more likely their parents are to transfer them to a charter program: “The transition of fifth grade to sixth grade is where you see people start to make that choice.” But the situation raises the old question: Why did the district bring IDEA to Austin in the first place? The original proposal was to create the latest and hope- fully most definitive restruc- turing of Eastside Memorial. After a seemingly never-ending series of reforms and staff overhauls and repurpo sings inflicted by the Texas Education Agency and AISD, IDEA was supposed to be the final format for the Allan campus. Then it became the entire Eastside Memorial Vertical Team, from pre-K through 12th grade. IDEA pushed hard for a vertical team takeover, arguing that it needed a geographic base to make this project work. However, Pickle belongs to the Reagan Vertical Team, not Eastside. It is also one of East Austin’s better-performing elementaries, achieving “recognized” status under the state accountability rules for the last two years. Zarifis said he was deeply concerned that the charter may be trying to skim the best students from perfectly good campuses. “The district says that IDEA is part of the family now,” he says. “I don’t know if it’s a drunk uncle that’s moved in, because they’re not playing by the same rules.” - Richard Whittaker 20 theaustin chronicle APRIL 13, 2012 austinchronicle.com “We believe Laura Pressley is a nice lady who will do well, but this is a protest endorsement. If a dog had run against Martinez, we would have endorsed that dog.” - Transit Union President Jay Wyatt As for the arbitrator’s decision last Friday, Martinez sees it as further proof that the board has made, and continues to make, concessions it doesn’t have to in order to maintain the best working conditions it can in the current political climate, while the union refuses to meet the board halfway. “The arbitration shows that Cap Metro is not obligated to offer the pension conditions we have as part of the settlement - still, we did it,” Martinez says. “We’ve been in arbitra- tion since March, and we’ve offered multiple concessions, including the one year of ser- vice, which will bring all employees one year closer to retiring with a full pension. They’ve rejected all settlement offers. “The best thing for the [transit] authority to do financially is to carry over the work- ers’ contracts without any of these benefits. But I’m trying to ensure the transition is smooth by maintaining a stable workforce and employee morale, by taking care of both our workforce and the agency as a whole. I don’t know what else to do to bridge this gap.” - Josh Rosenblatt BUSINESS CARDS • BOOKMARKERS PREMIUM FLYERS • POSTCARDS • RACK CARDS DOOR HANGERS • BROCHURES LETTERHEAD • ENVELOPES • LARGE FORMAT CUSTOM QUOTE !

There seems to be a growing consensus between city staff and neighbors that the Hancock Golf Course should and will remain just that - a golf course - while the Parks and Recreation Department installs a new graywater system and takes various other steps to improve conditions there - both physical and financial. When last we left this story back in Dec- ember, the PARD golf division was can- vassing Hancock neighbors and the public for their feelings about the tract. Hancock is a golf course in trouble, was PARD’s mes- sage: The number of rounds played there is down by almost two-thirds over the last decade, meaning that Hancock is losing a significant amount of money for the golf division (a city enterprise fund, unlike the rest of PARD). Moreover, between declin- ing revenues and the recent drought, course conditions have deteriorated signifi- cantly as well, which means no one wants to play there, which ... well, you can see the downward spiral. So, PARD wondered, what do the course’s neighbors think about the situation? Are they attached to having a golf course there, or might some other use - frisbee golf? dog park? soccer fields? - be equally attractive, while getting the property off the golf divi- sion’s debit sheet? Commercial development remains off the table; it would take voter approval for the city to sell, lease, or “other- wise encumber” this dedicated parkland. Now, after a number of community engagement meetings and presentations, what PARD has heard, with a surprising amount of consensus, is that neighbors very much want the golf course (“even though I don’t golf myself,” several have said) - for its history, its youth programs, and its natural beauty, and because there’s little doubt it’ll get better maintenance under the wing of the golf division’s enter- prise fund than it would if it were cut loose into the population of PARD properties maintained with General Fund tax monies. The two neighborhood associations that have brought up the matter officially at meetings, Hancock and Hyde Park, have voted on resolutions endorsing the course’s continuing operation. And in return, PARD - which was met with considerable skepticism going into the process - has already come back to the table with several pieces of good news and a promising game plan. First off, armed with the neighbors’ determination to improve course condi- tions, PARD has negotiated for Austin Water to front the money for a new reclaimed-water irrigation system, tap- ping into the line running down Red River Street. The estimated $500,000 re-piping expense will save $60,000 a year in water costs while providing more nutrients for the landscaping, PARD’s Kevin Gomillion told an HPNA meeting Monday night; work should begin in late summer and be completed without the course having to close down at any time. There are tentative plans as well for a significant tree-planting along the west edge of the course, essen- tially replacing a section of trees controver- sially removed by the city a few years back. Gomillion notes that this ties in with the new irrigation system, which can be built specifically to support the current and future trees. Earlier that same day, PARD Assistant Director Kimberly McNeeley sent out a memo to stakeholders who had attended a large community engagement meeting held March 24 at the Hancock Rec Center, in which she detailed the ideas for improvements which came up at the meet- ing, outlined an agenda for the next cou- ple of months, and promised a progress report on the developing Hancock action plan by mid-May. In particular, she noted that her team is already focussing on three areas of opportunities: alcohol sales, increased junior programs, and historic designation (Gomillion elaborated that a historian is researching conflicting claims about the course, which may or may not be the oldest course in Texas, and/or the oldest continuously operating course west of the Mississippi). At nine holes on a small tract with lots of challenges, Hancock is always going to be a square peg amid all the golf division’s round holes, but it seems it may fit into the game plans after all. - Nick Barbaro Spare That Tree Last November, when the owners of the old Dreyfus Antiques store at 1901 N. Lamar were applying for rezoning in anticipation of selling the property to a small banking con- cern out of Plano, a restrictive covenant was added to the zoning ordinance stating that the enormous oak tree on the property could not be removed unless it satisfied criteria under the city’s Environmental Criteria Manual - basically, unless it was determined that the tree poses a danger. Does this leafy mainstay at the corner of Martin Luther King Jr. and North Lamar boulevards pose a safety threat? Well, about a month ago, the tree’s new owner, Benchmark Bank, made a tree-removal request with the city of Austin, claiming the oak poses a safety hazard to passing motorists, pedestrians, and future bank employees. According to the two private arborists the bank hired, the oak is a high risk because of structural problems, namely that several of its branch/trunk unions have narrow angles, meaning the bark where the branch and trunk meet is likely to split. City arborist Michael Embesi says bank representatives have asked him to hold off on making any ruling while they gather more information and meet with neighborhood groups. “They’re feeling the situation out,” said Embesi. “They’re well aware that it’s an important tree, so they’re collecting infor- mation on its structure and health.” Embesi said he currently has no plans to address the case. Megan Filgo, a vice president with Benchmark, told the Chronicle her company has no interest in cutting down the tree if saving it is an option. “We love the tree,” she said. “It’s one of the reasons we bought the property. But safety is our biggest concern, so we’re looking into it more carefully. If there’s any way we can save the tree, we’re going to.” Filgo says the Austin team is “exhausting every resource,” includ- ing hiring more arborists and meeting with neighborhood lead- ers. “We’re a small neighborhood bank,” she said. “The bulk of our customers live near our branches. We want to know our neighbors; the last thing we want to do is upset them.” Not everyone is convinced. Tim League, owner of the Alamo Drafthouse chain of movie theatres and a neighbor of the new bank, told the Chronicle in an email that he’s con- vinced Benchmark is trying to “bypass the system to cut down the tree,” and that Embesi “is seriously considering granting a waiver” to cut the tree down. On the phone earlier this week, League sounded cautiously optimistic that Benchmark and the city are doing their best to save the tree. “I hope they do want to preserve it,” he said. Still, the memory of another heritage tree cut down two years ago without permits by owners of a property adjacent to the Dreyfus site has made League and others in his West Campus neighborhood jumpy. “I’m always skeptical, always nervous,” he said. - Josh Rosenblatt Oops In last week’s issue (“Boring Into BOR’,’ April 6), I criticized the Burnt Orange Report and its Editor-in-Chief Katherine Haenschen for their practice of bouncing back and forth between paid political consultancy jobs and supposed “journalism’.’ In her own defense, Haenschen is at pains to point out that she never left her position at BOR during the time when she was the paid campaign manager for Randi Shade’s city council campaign last year, while BOR continued to cover that campaign. Presumably this proves that she has no sense of politi- cal and journalistic ethics, and therefore rules regarding such couldn’t possibly apply to her. My apologies. - Nick Barbaro 22 the Austin chronicle APRIL 13, 2012 austinchronicle.com THE HIGHTOWER REPORT SIVh',\" OWER Paying for Perry the Pretender’s Presidential Run My state’s gallivanting goober of a gover- nor, Rick Perry, is back in the news, with yet another “oops” moment! This one is even stupider than Perry’s fail- ure to remember his own lines in a presiden- tial debate. It has to do with his fierce oppo- sition to spending taxpayer money and his firm stand for rootie-toot-toot rugged individu- alism. But - oops - Rick keeps failing to remember these principles when it comes to spending taxpay- ers’ money on his own indi- vidual desires. For example, in his gran- diose desire to be presi- dent, this tightfisted cham- pion of taxpayers dipped liberally into the public till to have Texas taxpayers subsi- dize his failed run. Perry essentially aban- doned the state and his gubernatorial duties for about six months - but the no- show governor kept billing us for his $150,000-a-year paycheck. It turns out that he was also double-dipping by taking another $90,000 a year in pension pay- ments, even though he’s not retired. Two state checks a month for doing nothing? Good work if you can get it! Wait, there’s more. Gov. Tightwad also socked us for at least $3.6 million to pay a covey of state troopers who traveled all over the country with him for his campaign and fundraising events. They helped arrange his trips, escorted him every- where, did logistical errands, and gave him an aura of importance - all on the tax- payers’ dime, while he gave speeches ridiculing wasteful government spending. Perry’s excuse for such gross hypocrisy is that it’s the law’s fault. State troopers are required to “protect” him wherever he travels, explained a spokeswoman. But - oops - how stupid is that? Anyone running for pres- ident who can’t make an easy executive decision to say “no” to such an unethical waste of taxpayers’ money is simply not up to the job - which, obviously, Perry the Pretender is not.

Candidate and campaign profiles for your consideration \\ BY MICHAEL KING 1 < The overriding issue in the May 12 | municipal election is not on the ballot: ° years of steadily declining voter turnout reflecting a public largely disengaged from local government and local issues. In recent years, turnout has been running persistently below 10%, although for a mayoral election it may get as high as 13-14%. (Because of this year’s confusion over the movable party primaries, there is concern the problem will worsen.) Theories for the diminishing returns range from “essentially satisfied voters” to “complete- ly alienated voters” to more practical expla- nations: for example, the all at-large voting system and campaign funding limits that also limit outreach to voters, who have heard much less (primarily on TV) about local issues and candidates than, say, the GOP presidential race. Yet local govern- ments have a much more direct effect on our daily lives and neighborhoods, and our municipal votes are proportionally much more powerful than national ones. Ripples in some early endorsements do reflect deep dissatisfaction with the cur- rent council on matters such as growth, development, and affordability - central issues in the mayoral campaign - but the broad slate of challengers most consis- tently reflects a sort of free-floating liber- tarianism from candidates with little political experience. The mayor’s race and Place 5 feature most of the action, but there is plenty here to allow voters to consider the prospects and future of Austin and its city government. In that light, the Chronicle offers this overview of the candidates, with brief sum- maries on the individual races and thumb- nails of the specific candidates (asterisks denote incumbents). We’ve gathered that information from candidates’ statements, questionnaires, forum appearances, web- sites (where available), and any other infor- mation we’ve been able to find. To vote in this election, you must be registered to vote by April 12; early vot- ing runs from April 30 to May 8.

Mayor: Defining Leadership, Choosing Direction Brigid Shea and Clay Dafoe vs. Lee Leffingwell The mayoral race could be described as “Classic” vs. “New Austin” - and voters will have to decide which candidate belongs to which era. Incumbent Lee Leffingwell is “running on his record,” and among other accomplishments cites the major environmental initiatives on his watch: his work on water conservation, the renew- able energy generation plan, initiating single-stream recycling, the ban on coal-tar parking lot sealants, the expansion of the Save Our Springs Ordinance to cover redeveloped land over the Edwards Aquifer, and the pending ban on single-use plastic bags. Challenger Brigid Shea points to her founding membership in the Save Our Springs Alliance and to the citizens’ movement underlying the ordi- nance that established a “new political consensus” in the city that “environmentalism is good for our economy.” She believes that legacy has diminished under Leffingwell, whom she says has not been “aggressive enough” in defending Austin’s quality of life. She opposed the Water Treatment Plant No. 4 project (under construc- tion, but still an issue in yet another election cycle), and she believes that the City Council’s willingness to grant corporate “giveaways” (particularly the Congress Avenue convention hotel fee waivers and the Formula One project infrastructure) have undermined the city’s finances and “paid corporations to come here” that would have relocated anyway. Leffingwell responds that WTP4 is both a necessary and “sound environmental project” - replacing aged infrastructure and reduc- ing the city’s carbon "
