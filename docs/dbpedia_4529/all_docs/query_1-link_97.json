This document provides a summary of various primary source materials related to Operation Gladio, a covert anti-communist program established in Western Europe during the Cold War. The documents discuss the origins of Gladio at the Yalta Conference in 1945 and the ideological concerns that drove its expansion. They also outline the covert action directives and training manuals that guided Gladio operations, revealing how cells of armed stay-behind units were prepared to implement terrorist tactics if needed to counter internal communist influence or occupation. Taken together, the materials shed light on the secret history of Western involvement in anti-communist violence and subversion across Europe during the Cold War.",
