        "text": "March 27, 2021\n\nOverall, a decent but flawed look into the relationship between the CIA, various organized crime outfits, and international money laundering. The overarching points the author covers about the interlinked nature of the CIA, the Mafia, and the global drug trade to finance Gladio and other black operations he establishes reasonably well, its just when he really digs into the individuals he goes off on some wrong paths.\n\nI think a lot of the places he veers off course largely stem from the issue a lot of libs and reactionaries run into when they look into this parapolitical stuff, which is they come at it backwards and see it as the individual wills of a small group of people moving material forces around for their whims, rather than that entities like the CIA and the Council on Foreign Relations aren't like, esoteric satanic cabals, they're simply manifestations of the ruling class exerting its influence to further its material interests. The accumulation of capital into the hands of the ruling class naturally leads them to pursue policies to maintain and further consolidate their wealth and power, which manifests in the various arms of the state, both official and congressionally sanctioned and otherwise. The individuals involved are not really super relevant its the capital forces they represent. But by coming at it focusing on the individuals, and filtering it through various ideologies like racism, orientalism, etc, idealists go off course and end up in weird reactionary dead ends\n\nFebruary 27, 2017\n\nBasic claims: 1) That the CIA allied with the Sicilian and U.S. mafia in establishing the US heroin trade, using the profits to fund covert anti-communist operations around the world. 2) That the money involved in these transactions was laundered through Vatican and other Catholic-run banks.\n\nSome of this seems reasonably well documented, but the author has a tendency to blur together different issues in different times and places, creating the impression of a vast, sprawling conspiracy... but in the process coming to seem like one of those people ranting about the Illuminati or UFOs.\n\nOne of the interesting takeaways was the story of the Masonic lodge \"Propaganda Due\"\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Propaga...\n\nwhich included many of the powers that be in late 20th century Italy, including a range of Catholic clergy (who are prohibited by canon law from being masons).\n\nAnyway, certainly worth reading if you like conspiracy theories. There's a lot of stuff about the nuances of money-laundering which can be a bit tedious to read, unless that's your cup of tea.\n\nFebruary 2, 2023\n\nI feel largely the same way with this as I did reading Peter Dale Scott's \"The Road to 9/11\". That is, it's full of information and details such as names and places, but it's lacking in an ideological analysis that provides the reader with an understanding of the material forces undergirding the stories. Condensing down the main ideas of this book, it could have been accomplished in under 100 pages. That being said, those ideas are quite interesting and important: the Vatican being a money laundering agent for the mafia in cahoots with the CIA as it was launching the global drug trade at the height of the Cold War.\n\nJuly 1, 2024\n\nThis book is about a secret operation set up by the OSS, the predecessor to the CIA, consisting of setting up sleeper counterinsurgency groups throughout Western Europe in the event of a Soviet invasion. The cells would sabotage the occupation authorities and prepare a counter invasion by the US and its allies. The operation was codenamed Gladio, for the short swords used by Roman gladiators in the arena. It was the brainchild of Allen Dulles when he was negotiating the surrender in Northern Italy of SS Colonel Wolff against explicit agreement between the Allied Powers. The core of Gladio was made up of the most anticommunists elements, mainly unrepentant fascists and sympathizers. The weapons they used were caches left behind by the Germans and initial funding was provided by plundered assets, particularly the gold of the Croatian central bank that had been looted by the Ustashas and left for safekeeping in the Vatican.\n\nAccording to Williams, further financing was obtained from heroin traffic in league with Chiang Kai Shek, and later with the Vietnamese. This required an alliance with the various Italian and Corsican mafias, as well as with the money laundering capabilities of the IOR, the Vatican bank. Afterwards the cocaine trade with South America would pick up the slack. Gladio eventually went global. Through the Turkish hard right (the Grey Wolves) it penetrated the Muslim world and through Argentinian members of P-2 (a sinister Masonic lodge made up of the most powerful men in Italy) also Latin America. The counterpart to Gladio in this part is the of the world was operation Condor, an alliance between dictatorships to cooperate in the persecution of opponents on a continental scale. Back in its Italian home ground Gladio applied the strategy of increasing tensions between the government and the leftists in order to promote a coup d'etat that would lead to a rightist dictatorship. Thus, P-2 sponsored multiple terrorist actions that claimed hundreds of lives in what came to be named \"the years of lead\". According to Williams, the murder of leftish Christian Democrat Prime Minister Aldo Moro by the Red Brigades was in fact arranged by P-2, since it had been able to penetrate the radical Marxist group.\n\nAnd this is where the book becomes hard to rate. It is full of explosive yet unsubstantiated revelations. The CIA arranged for the murder of John Paul I because he was going to spill the beans on the IOR and reveal Gladio. Yet he is also described as insubstantial, a nonentity with a nervous smile. The CIA had John Paul II elected because he would let the IOR continue its business as usual as long as it provided funds for the Pope's anti-Soviet activities through Lech Walesa and the Solidarity trade union. When the Pope made overtures to the Soviets the CIA and other intelligence agencies arranged the Agca attempt on his life and blamed it on Bulgarian intelligence. The German intelligence uses the Grey Wolves to control Turkish German residents.\n\nIs any of this true? Williams picks up these rumors and presents them as facts. Yet rumors they remain.\n\nA very interesting part of the book near the end refers to the connections between Gladio and the Turkish Deep State. He refers in great detail about the enmity between Turkish President Tayyip Erdogan and US based cleric Fethullah Gullen. I knew nothing about this before reading the book but it was in the news when Erdogan blamed Gullen for a failed insurrection in July 2016. So there may be something even in the wilder assertions by the author.\n\nAnother unappealing aspect of the book is the glee the author displays when recounting the shenanigans of some clerics as evidenced by his continuous references to \"Holy mother Church\" and his relentless antipathy to John Paul II and his defense of murderous Latin American guerrillas such as the Tupamaros. He is deeply anti-Catholic. He sometimes seems unhinged by his hatred for the Church. In fact, recently he was the subject of a criminal investigation after he falsely accused an Egyptian researcher of having stolen radioactive materials from a research facility.\n\nThis book is a heavy dish, made with unknown ingredients, that yet has an intriguing taste. Don't recommend it for conspiracy theory fans or they'll find themselves unable to sleep for many nights.\n\nSeptember 10, 2021\n\nI have to say what an excellent writing style for one and also what excellent research has been done by the author to bring all this to light. I do think his underlying assumptions ruin the conclusions a little bit. I think his assumption that the CIA and the Vatican are secretly Nazis because they used whatever groups they could to fight against communism and defend neoliberalism world hegemony is where he goes off the rails.\n\nHe misses the understanding that the remaining right wing groups acted as perfect foil to allow capitalism to save face its not that everyone is secretly a fascist so let's be sympathetic to communists now. I also doubt many of the extravagant claims of the Jewish community in this book. Like most cases they purposely tell lies to further there own agenda aswell.\n\nOverall though what is found in this book is deeply troubling and mind opening. I makes me think that none of these CIA Ops every really ended especially when it comes to Gladio and Mockingbird. It is also interesting to see how much the Vatican's corruption follows up even to our present Pope. I highly recommend this book especially to Third Positionist leaning Catholics you will be shocked and amazed at what is presented here and it may tie some loose ends in your mind about certain topics in regards to your faith and poltics.\n\nOctober 13, 2022\n\nThis non-fiction spy thriller blew my mind! Not one for conspiracy theories, Operation Gladio detailed the evil collusion between the CIA, the mafia and the Vatican in ways one would suppose it to be a conspiracy theory had Mr. Williams' research not been so exhaustive and well cited.\n\nThe operation dubbed Gladio came into being after WWII, necessitated by the need for the US to monitor communist activities via small \"stay behind\" units made up of spies. In order to pay for the costs associated with the upkeep of these stay behind units, the CIA began to import drugs from Asia (often transported on government planes/Later NATO planes) to sell to inner-city African-Americans via hand-picked mafia connections.\n\nBefore the proceeds from the CIA drug sales could be put to use, the money needed to be laundered, covering its origins. To accomplish this task, the CIA via the mafia contacted their \"sources\" at the Vatican. Who would ever suspect the Catholic Church in laundering drug money, after all? Furthermore, the Vatican bank was an institution unto itself, beyond investigation from outside (and as it turned out, even inside) sources, this making the bank beyond reproach.\n\nAs the operation unfolded over the years, the CIA had its hand in picking the players to ensure the operation's success: journalists; government officials within and without the US; foreign operators; mafia bosses; catholic cardinals; even The Pope!\n\nThe operation had tentacles in foreign governments, global banks, drug manufacturing, drug import and sales, mass murder, political assassinations, coups, etc... The operation involved the uber-secretive Freemasons and even planted Masons within the church.\n\nThe book documents specific examples of each of the above doings and will give the reader pause, especially as they learn of the assassination of Pope John Paul I.\n\nA fascinating read!\n\nThis entire review has been hidden because of spoilers.\n\nJune 19, 2023\n\nA detailed accounting of Italy’s years of lead, the shadowy forces behind them, and the way that the ruling class was able to transplant their southern European operations globally. What i found most interesting was the importance of the heroin trade, both during the cold war and in modern day. Oil is typically thought of as the One Commodity, the thing that wars are fought over and wealth is measured it, but heroin is just as important to global trade and American hegemony. I wish there was a ‘The Prize’ style 700 page book about the heroin trade but alas.\n\nJanuary 1, 2023\n\n“In my 30-year career in the Drug Enforcement Administration and related agencies, the major targets of my investigations almost invariably turned out to be working for the CIA.” — Dennis Dayle, former chief of an elite DEA enforcement unit.\n\nThis is the craziest book I’ve ever read. This is the type of book that, even describing it, sounds insane. But it is heavily sourced and written by a respectable author. High recommend for anyone who wants to learn about US crimes against humanity.\n\nTo describe Project Gladio in one sentence…\n\nProject Gladio was a CIA-backed operation to sell heroin to the Italian-American Mafia and give that money to the Vatican Bank to fund fascist paramilitary organizations and mobsters tasked with subverting democracy and committing false-flag terrorist acts to frame and derail anti-capitalist political groups in Italy and across Europe.\n\nPart 1: The USA has always sympathized with Nazis\n\nThe fact that the US was not on the same side of the Nazis in WW2 is a historical fluke. They were (and still are) much more closely ideologically aligned with Nazi Germany than their ally of circumstance: the Soviet Union. Before, during, and after WW2, the US government and business interests have had strong sympathies with Nazis and their ideology.\n\nAllen Dulles, director of the OSS (precursor to the CIA), said “We’re fighting the wrong enemy” in 1942, in reference to Nazi Germany. He planned treasonous back room deals with the Nazi high command while the war was still happening, trying to achieve a separate peace. Read “The Devil’s Chessboard” for more on him.\n\n“Hohenlohe [a liaison between Dulles and German High Command] was surprised to learn that Dulles not only endorsed the Nazi proposal, but also maintained that a strong Germany was necessary as a bulwark against Bolshevism…”. See: Operation Sunrise\n\nThese guys loved Nazism if it meant stopping communism. This is a foundational ideology of US capitalists to this day. They will always side with fascists to protect capitalism. Whether libertarians, Soc-Dems, Neoliberals, when it comes down to it, they always end up backing fascists.\n\nDulles worked with Nazi General Reinhard Gelhen to create Nazi “stay-behind units” as a police force against the soviets. “Gehlen had been asked by the OSS to set up stay-behind units made up of fellow Nazis to spy on the Soviet Union.” They later became the BND under Chancellor Konrad Adenauer in 1956.\n\nA US director of a covert agency working with literal Nazis to keep Nazis in power during and after WW2. The US funded and supplied these Nazi units with the help of Dulles’ other Nazi friend Karl Wolff.\n\nThese stay-behind units became integrated into “Operation Gladio”.\n\nPart 1.1: US&Vatican-backed Nazi ratlines\n\nThe Vatican and OSS helped Nazis escape justice around the end of WW2, helping them flee to SA (primarily Argentina)\n\n“At the close of the war, the pope [Pius XII], along with Monsignor Giovanni Battista Montini, his Undersecretary of State, had worked with Dulles and the OSS to create the ratlines used to help Nazis escape Europe, something he viewed as an essential means to address the threat of Communism. Several prominent Nazis, including Walter Rauff—who had led an extermination unit of the SS across Italy—still remained sheltered within Vatican City, ready to join in the struggle against the Red Menace.”\n\nKlaus Barbie, “[t]he so-called ‘Butcher of Lyons’ was responsible for 4,342 murders and 7,591 deportations to death camps during his two-year posting in the French city. After the war, US intelligence placed him in a safe house in Augsburg, provided him with a sanitized identity, and granted him a generous stipend of $1,700 a month. In 1983, the Justice Department belatedly admitted that US intelligence officials had arranged for Barbie's escape to Bolivia (where he became known as Klaus Altmann and opened a sawmill in La Paz), and that they had lied by denying to French Nazi hunter Serge Klarsfeld that he was under their protection.” This Nazi was critical in the CIA’s anti-communist terror campaigns throughout South America.\n\nPart 1.2: US-Backed Nazi Argentina\n\n“On March 25, 1976, two days after the coup, William Rogers, assistant secretary for Latin America, advised Kissinger that the military takeover of Argentina would result in ‘a fair amount of repression, probably a good deal of blood.’ To this warning, Kissinger responded, ‘Yes, but that is in our interest.’” If there were really any justice in this world, Henry Kissinger would be rotting in a jail cell.\n\nIn April, 1976, the US gave the Argentinian military dictatorship $50,000,000. Also “In April 1976 the public was invited by two groups calling themselves the Aryan Integral Nationalist Fatherland and the Pious Christian Crusade to attend Masses in the Buenos Aires cathedral ‘for the eternal rest of our blood brother in Christ, Adolf Hitler.’” The regime went on to commit a Jewish Pogram.\n\nArgentina’s “Dirty War” (1976-1983) resulted in up to 30,000 people killed or disappeared.\n\nPart 2: Drugs for Guns\n\nThe newly anointed CIA did not want the citizenry of the United States of America to know about the fact that they were arming fascists to overthrow democracy in ally nations, but they needed money.\n\n“Gladio was a covert operation and had not been initiated by an act of Congress or a mandate from the Pentagon. Few federal officials knew of its existence. The $200 million in original funding came from the Rockefeller and Mellon foundations. But a new and steady stream of revenue had to be created almost overnight....”\n\nTherefore, the CIA oversaw the growing of poppies for the manufacture of heroin, which was sold to buy guns and bombs for the fascists in Europe & SA. The heroin was sold to gangsters in the USA and resulted in the skyrocketing of opiate addiction in the US after WW2. In 1947, the CIA began working with the Mafia to transport heroin into the US.\n\nPart 3: The Mafia and the Vatican\n\n“During the summer of 1947, the terms of the working relationship between the CIA and the Mafia were ironed out by Frank Wisner and Angleton. Meyer Lansky and Helliwell would work in tandem to handle the financial aspect of the narcotics venture through General Development Corporation, a shell company in Miami. Angleton would handle any legal disputes between the mob and the CIA through New York lawyer Mario Brod.”\n\nThe CIA oversaw the Italian-American Mafia as they sold heroin, specifically targeting Harlem and other black areas. The CIA’s money couldn’t go to the fascist paramilitary groups directly… “It had to be channeled through a financial firm that would not be subjected to scrutiny by US treasury agents, Italian bank examiners, or international fiscal monitors. Only one institution possessed such immunity, and it was located in the heart of Vatican City.”\n\nThe Vatican Bank served as a money-launder to turn the CIA’s dirty drug money into clean money for the Gladio stay-behind units. This makes sense, given that they were also sheltering literal Nazis.\n\n“In 1945, the pope had held private audiences with Wild Bill Donovan [executive director of the OSS and chairman of the World Commerce Corporation] to discuss the implementation of Gladio and had decorated him as a crusader against Communism with the Grand Cross of the Order of St. Sylvester”\n\nThe Vatican has already been proven to be a cesspool of pedophiles and their protectors. It is not a legitimate democracy. It is a rogue state with diplomatic immunity from Italy. It’s not a surprise at all to assert that it is full of crime. The damn place has no regulatory body! “As a sovereign state, the Holy See cannot be subjected to any ruling by any foreign court. It remains an institution with over $50 billion in securities, gold reserves that exceed those of some industrialized nations, real estate holdings that equal the total area of many countries, and opulent palaces containing the world's greatest art treasures.”\n\nPerfect place to do crimes. A gangsters paradise.\n\nPart 4: Subverting Democracy\n\nThe CIA had carte blanche to do whatever they wanted. Their fundamental ideology was the maintenance of the US as a oligopolistic superpower, and destabilize any government or organization that even slightly threatened US hegemony. To them, the ends justified the means. So whether it was rigging elections, assassinating political figures, overthrowing democratically elected governments, funding death squads, bombing civilians, or funneling addictive drugs into the USA’s underprivileged communities, that was all perfectly acceptable to them.\n\nAs previously mentioned, two world wars caused by imperialist capitalist nations resulted in a skyrocketing of anti-capitalist sentiment. Italian Communists helped win the war against Mussolini.\n\n“Postwar Italy stood poised to become the first Communist country in Western Europe. Hundreds of thousands of northerners had either actively supported or actively fought for the partisan movement that had finally forced the German army out of Italy. It was the partisans who had captured Mussolini and who had hung him upside down with his mistress; it was the partisans who continued to assassinate Fascists after the war ended; and it was the partisans who constituted the [Italian Communist Party]. By 1946, the division in the country had become acute, with the people in the north wanting a Communist republic and the people in the south wanting a Catholic monarchy.”\n\nGuess which side the USA sided with! The 1948 election in Italy started the new era of US imperialism: The US-backed subversion of democracy to install fascist dictators that were pro-US business interests. To achieve this, the US funded fascist paramilitary groups.\n\n“In the months before [Italy’s] 1948 national election, the CIA dumped $65 million of its black money into the Vatican Bank. […] The CIA's black money for mob muscle was paid out by the Vatican bank from ecclesiastical organizations, including Catholic Action. […] Don Calo and an army of thugs, including Vito Genovese's cousin Giovanni Genovese, burned down eleven Communist branch offices and made four assassination attempts on Communist leader Girolamo Li Causi. The gang…also opened fire on a crowd of workers celebrating May Day in Portella della Ginestra, killing eleven and wounding fifty-seven. […] Throughout 1948, in Sicily alone, the CIA-backed terror attacks resulted in the killing of on average five people a week. […] Monsignor Don Giuseppe Bicchierai, acting upon papal authority, assembled a terror gang charged with the task of beating up Communist candidates, smashing left-wing political gatherings, and intimidating voters. The money, guns, and jeeps for the Monsignor's terror attacks were furnished by the CIA from surplus World War II stockpiles. […] On Election Day, Don Calo and his men stuffed ballot boxes and bribed voters with gifts of freshly laundered drug money…. The mob's tactics worked, and the Christian Democrats triumphantly returned to power. In his memoirs, William Colby, who would later become the director of the CIA, wrote that the Communists would have gained 60 percent of the vote without the Agency's sabotage.”\n\nThe quotes above are just a small fraction of what the US government did through Project Gladio, and Project Gladio is just one small piece of their international terror campaign.\n\nWhen I say ‘The United States Federal Government is the largest terrorist organization on earth,’ I mean that quite literally. Whether the CIA, the DoD, the State Department or the rest, they are together responsible for the vast majority of global terror over the last 70 years. When I say “Everyone to the left of Bernie Sanders gets assassinated by the CIA” I mean that literally. Historically everyone within The West who garners any political power and is politically to the left of Bernie Sanders ends up getting assassinated by the CIA or one of their terror groups.\n\nPart 5: Vietnam, et al.\n\nAs the CIA-backed terror campaigns exploded across Europe, their heroin money started to run dry. So they expanded to French Indo-China: Cambodia, Laos, and Vietnam, with the help of the Corsican Mafia.\n\n“In 1949, the CIA and the Luciano syndicate sorely needed the talents of the Corsicans for the creation of a new narcotics network. But the labor unions in Marseilles [France], where the heroin laboratories were located, remained controlled by Communists, who refused to load and unload ships coming from French Indochina, where the rebel army of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam (a force that would morph into the Viet Cong) was fighting for independence from the French Union.”\n\nThis really makes the tapestry of history come together nicely. Why did we invade Vietnam, a French colony on the other side of the world? “To stop the spread of Communism?” Yes, by shoring up the heroin manufacturing in Vietnam to fund their covert operations and overt global terror campaigns. Fucking bananas.\n\nPart 6: The US-led Global Terror Campaign - SPEED ROUND\n\nThe US-led global terror campaign is so vast and extensive that my summary can never do it justice. Here are some things you can google to learn more…\n\n• Operation Paper (not to be confused with Operation Paperclip)\n\n• Operation Mockingbird\n\n• Counter-Guerrilla: CIA backed military coup in Turkey in 1960, resulting in the extremist Nationalist Action Party to take power. Also staged another coup in 1980 “that toppled the government of Bülent Ecevit and the Democratic Left Party. Upon hearing the news, President Jimmy Carter phoned Paul Henze, the CIA station chief in Ankara, and said, with great relief, ‘Your people have made the coup!’” Shouts out to war criminal Jimmy Carter.\n\n• Grey Wolves of Turkey: “the CIA unleashed them to fight the PKK—the Kurdistan Workers Party. Formed in 1978, the PKK sought to establish a Marxist-Leninist state in a swath of land […] which they called Kurdistan.”\n\n• Fethullah Gülen - A guy trying to undermine the Turkish government whom the CIA protects from extradition to a NATO country. Worked with Graham Fuller.\n\n• Yaşar Öz, whom the FBI busted for drug smuggling but was let go because he had “diplomatic immunity, along with special NATO clearance”\n\n• Operation Demagnetize\n\n• Operation Eagle, 1968\n\n• Operation Condor\n\n• Liberation Theology - A sect of Christianity taught by many South American Catholics. “In 1975, the Bolivian Interior Ministry—a publicly acknowledged subsidiary of the CIA—drew up a master plan with the help of Vatican officials for the elimination of liberation theology.”\n\n• Argentina’s “Dirty War” (1976-1983)\n\n• Project Haven - The 1977 IRS investigation into Castle Bank, which was used for the transferring of heroin money. “Such evidence led to a grand jury investigation. But after the jury was assembled, the investigation was called off. The CIA had issued a warning to the US Justice Department that the pursuit of criminal proceedings against the Castle Bank would endanger ‘national security.’\n\n• Operation Phoenix - “a Stalin-like program that resulted in the assassination of an estimated forty thousand South Vietnamese civilians who were suspected of collaborating with the Viet Cong.”\n\n• Operation Cyclone - spreading radical militant islam throughout Central Asian republics, resulting in the rise of Al Qaeda\n\n• The BCCI, one of the CIA’s favorite corporate banks for transferring drug money\n\n• Kintex - Bulgarian illegal arms trafficker and “used extensively by NATO and the CIA”\n\n• Air America, Frederick Luytjes, & Wilkes-Barre/Scranton airport - The plane company, pilot, & route set up by the CIA to smuggle drugs and money for Pablo Escobar.\n\n• The October Surprise - The time George H. W. Bush committed treason to help Ronald Reagan win the presidency\n\n• The Brabant Massacre in Belgium\n\n• Iran-Contra: Am I really supposed to believe that was a one-off?\n\n• The Uyghurs and Graham Fuller (the craziest part of the book. Stupid text limit)\n\n• “European Parliament resolution on Gladio - Joint resolution replacing B3-2021, 2058, 2068, 2078 and 2087/90”\n\nPart 6.1: Just Italy\n\n• Piano Solo - A CIA-backed coup plot in Italy in 1963\n\n• The Golpe Borghese - December 7 1970, Another CIA-backed coup plot in Italy\n\n• The Sicilian Coup plot of 1972, which almost resulted in Sicily becoming the a US State.\n\n• Piazza Fontana bombing, December 12 1969 - CIA-backed false flag attack that killed 17 and wounded 88. Giovanni Ventura, a collaborator of the attack, provided “confidential CIA files. One document, dated May 4, 1969, listed a number of detailed steps to be taken, including ‘a possible wave of terror attacks to convince public opinion of the dangers of maintaining the [government's] alliance with the left.’”\n\n• Peteano Massacre - May 31 1971, Neofascist terrorist attack blamed on communist groups\n\n• Piazza della Loggia bombing\n\n• Italicus Rome-Munich Express Bombing\n\n• Prime Minister Aldo Moro Kidnapping & murder\n\n• CIA plot to assassinate Pope John-Paul II - “The arrangements had been made by members of the Sovereign Military Order of Malta, P2, and the Safari Club, a covert organization that had been established by Henry Kissinger. The gunmen would be Çatlı and Ağca.”\n\n• Coup plot outlined in “Memorandum sulla Situazione Italiana” and “Piano di Rinascita Democratica”\n\n• “Parliamentary Commission of the Italian Senate for the Investigation of Terrorism in Italy” and “The So-Called Parallel SID—Operation Gladio”\n\nPart 7 - “Reigning in” the CIA\n\n“In the wake of Watergate and revelations about the CIA's involvement in the toppling of the government of Salvador Allende in Chile, Congress passed the Foreign Assistance (Hughes–Ryan) Act in 1974, which stipulated that the president must be personally informed of all covert operations and must endorse a ‘finding’ that such operations are necessary for ‘national security.’”\n\nFrom its founding in 1947 to 1974, the CIA had ~3 decades of free reign to do whatever without oversight even by the President.\n\nBut nothing has changed since 1974 in the CIA. Their reign of global terror has continued on to this day. We must call for nothing short of the CIA’s complete abolition and prosecution of crimes committed by its agents and directors.\n\nPart 8 - Operation Cyclone\n\nAfter the US lost the war in Vietnam, they needed a new place to grow heroin. They chose Afghanistan. In 1975, there was a conflict between the Afghan government and fundamentalist Pashtun tribesmen. “The tribesmen were led by Gulbuddin Hekmatyar, who became the new darling of the CIA.”\n\n“Hekmatyar urged his followers to throw acid in the faces of women not wearing a veil, kidnapped rival Islamic chieftains, and, in 1977, began to build up an arsenal, courtesy of the CIA.” Coooool.\n\nThe CIA was aiding radical Islamic sects in Afghanistan way before the Soviet Union invaded. “Throughout 1978, a year before the Soviet invasion, Hekmatyar and his mujahideen burned universities and girls’ schools throughout Afghanistan and gained feudal control over many of the poppy farmers.” Poppy cultivation skyrocketed. In 1979, the Afghani president was killed in a coup. The new guy, Hafizullah Amin, previously served as president of a CAI front organization, was educated in the west, and was highly amenable to the interest of the CIA, which was funding his regime.\n\n“Fearing a fundamentalist, US-backed regime at its border, the Soviets invaded Afghanistan on December 27, 1979.” And who can blame them, really?\n\n“To provide more support for the mujahideen, the CIA used Abdullah Azzam, Osama bin Laden's mentor, to set up a cell of al-Qaeda within Masjid al-Farooq on Atlantic Avenue in Brooklyn, New York. The cell, known as the al-Kifah Refugee Center, acted as a front for the transference of funds, weapons, and recruits to Afghanistan.” …uuhhh...Did Operation Cyclone inadvertently result in 9/11?\n\nApril 21, 2023\n\nInteresting read. However the analysis overall is pretty flawed. There is a great deal of info to sort through and without question under a more deft hand (say Alfred McCoy) that info could be contextualized into a coherent and piercing narrative.\n\nFebruary 9, 2019\n\nThis might be an interesting book if labeled as historical fiction. Unfortunately, it is an \"account\" that is built by threading together conspiracy theory and imagining threads of events that may not really exist. It might make a good movie screenplay, but it isn't good history. It relies far too much on reportage instead of primary or even secondary sources, without critical evaluation.\n\nApril 2, 2018\n\nRead twice. Awesome, what books are for. A true revelation, systematic, complete, fundamental. It really is the \"Unholy Alliance between the Vatican, the CIA, and the Mafia\"\n\nJune 10, 2023\n\nin simple terms, op gladio was cia arranged scheme to get black money to stay behind units in europe for combating communism. it packed its bags in europe around 1988, but continues in turkey and latin america. Most of the leading figures of this piepline were killed or died of natural causes as were many investigators who tried to link all the departments together.\n\nBasically, american P.L.Helliwell, intelligence spook, thought of a scheme to launder (through vatican IOR bank) millions fo dollars from drug sales (herione to black communities of USA) and distribute them to paramilitary units inside europe and turkey where it could be utilized to target communists/socialists. Most devastating effect of gladio was on Italy which suffered from multiple terro attacks in 70;s conducted by gladio units that were blamed on radicals and leftists. Mnay italian military agents and industralists were aware of this scheme through their membership in the Masonic Lodge P2. Vatican bankers created a host of shell companies and banks to launder this money in a complex financial web. In latic america, this operation became known as Op. Condor, but the spirit was the same: give money to dictatorships and terror squads that were anti-communist.\n\nThe vatican, through its clergy and BANK, were silent partners in Gladio(Calvi and Sindona were both silenced after their useful stints with the bank finished) Eventually, the op was wrapped up in eruope as Soveit union was near breakup. But gladio units in turkey were kept on the pay (THe grey wolves) since the americans wanted to control the muslim populations of new central asian republics through Turkish Islam. (Gullen is being propped up by USA and cia operatives continue to house his schools in various countries).\n\nwhile the vatican and its shell companies are no longer used in drug for arms Gladio pipeline, CIA continues to harbour drug omney from poppy fields in Afg (not now) and launder it through american banks (they are fined whenever they are caught) while the Vatican is still in bed with Sicilian mafia and continues to launder their money (while keeping a fee).\n\nMany gladio investigators were silenced including a pope (murdered in '78)and so any journalists.\n\nThe book offers a sweeping look at history. The writer sometimes fails to connect all the dots between\n\nall disparate events as one cohesive story but there is enough truth underneath the story that one fumes at this crazy operation which CIA industrialists and IVY league educated post WW2 spooks conjured up to advance american global domination and defeat communism.\n\nlets hope the stars shine better in future.\n\nThis entire review has been hidden because of spoilers.\n\nFebruary 15, 2022\n\nI give the book 5-stars because it's a very useful summary of very important events in modern history that remains unknown to many.\n\nThe scale of manipulation, disinformation and murder cannot be forgiven, much less forgotten and should not be overlooked.\n\nI understand well that Gladio may have served at some stage a praiseworthy goal of containing the Soviet Union. I'm not a zealot, not a fervent supporter of any political party. However evil the Soviet Union might have been, especially toward its own people, we should forget neither the preceding tsarist regime nor the Western military intervention on Russian soil when the Bolsheviks refused to continue to participate in the war. The relationship began on an evil note...\n\nThe extent and lengths to which mighty and influential people in the West went to supposedly \"combat evil\" is simply unacceptable.\n\nI'm not even evoking the famous principle: \"The end DOES NOT justify the means\" aka \"You can't fight evil with evil\".\n\nIt's way beyond that. Italy, South America and others - even Turkey and, of course, Greece - suffered greatly in this manipulative game.\n\nThe book is precise enough in recounting the intellectual origins, the beginnings and the zenith of Gladio.\n\nIt reads well, but leaves some things unexplained. The style and method of chapter division and contents is acceptable. The chronology is clear enough, the amount of information is ample.\n\nOf course, no book is flawless but this is a very important book for all history geeks and professionals.\n\nJanuary 23, 2019\n\nBecause I hold the Vatican and the CIA in low esteem the reasoning and conclusions are entirely plausible. The narration is excellent.\n\nMay 16, 2019\n\nThis book is an amazing recount of some of the darkest events of the XX century. The book is superbly annotated but the credibility of the authors sources is suspect. Many of the sources are secondary (other books such as this one) and other are shady websites with little or no credibility. Many of the “facts” that the author takes for undisputed truth are highly controversial when not directly contradicted by the oficial version.\n\nWhat follows is a resume of the text:\n\nAt the end of WWII top members of the US intelligence OSS, among them Allen Dulles, “Wild” Bill Donovan, and James Jesus Angleton, started to prepare for an eventual confrontation with the Soviet Union. To achieve this goal they recruited and protected Nazis such as Reinhard Gehlen and Klaus Barbie to form a number of clandestine armies in many countries of Europe. This would be known as “Operation Gladio”.\n\nTo help many of the Nazis escape from Europe to Latin America, the americans formed and alliance with the Vatican.\n\nThe Vatican saw the atheist communists as a direct competitor for “the souls of men” and a mortal threat to their existence. They helped many Nazis escape to Latin America by providing them with fake passports.\n\nAs the operation grew, the newly formed CIA under Allen Dulles, saw the need to secure immense amounts of black money to finance it. The solution came from a previous scheme concocted by Col. Paul E. Helliwell while he was serving as Chief of Special Intelligence for the OSS in China to provide covert assistance to General Chaing Kai-shek, leader of the Kuomintang (KMT—the Chinese National Army) to raise funds for his army's planned war against the Communist forces of Mao Zedong. Helliwell mounted a fleet of planes to run heroin into China to secure the need funded. This would become the model for “Air America” the CIA drug operation to smuggle heroin from Vietnam to sell in poor black neighborhoods in Harlem.\n\nThe drug network would expand with time to include the Italian mafia in America and Italy, the Turkish mafia, the Corsican mafia, the Latin America drug lords such as Escobar and many other criminal organizations. The black money from the drug trafficking will be laundered by the Vatican Bank under the control of archbishop Paul Marcinkus, also known as “the gorilla” and a series of shadowy corporations created by the CIA and the mob bankers.\n\nThroughout the 1950s, hundreds of Italian clerics and members of the Church's “black nobility” joined the Mafia in support of Operation Gladio. To protect the clandestine nature of this Catholic Gladio and the other stay-behind units, meetings of the anti-Communist forces were conducted in Masonic lodges. Eventually, several “stay-behind” units in Italy evolved into covert Masonic organizations. The main of such units became known as Propaganda Due, or P2.\n\nThe time was right for the CIA to unleash the full force of Gladio through a strategy of tension, which would cause the people of Italy first and many other countries later to view the Communists as a threat to their lives and well-being by infiltrating and impersonating the radical left to cause violence in the form of terrorist attacks and killings to force the need to repress the rise of communism.\n\nAfter the URSS invasion of Afghanistan, the CIA's main concern was no longer left-wing political activity in Italy and Western Europe but rather the situation in Afghanistan. To drive the “evil empire” to the point of total collapse, the CIA would infuse the holy war with munitions and money and training, until the war in Afghanistan became the Agency's most expensive covert undertaking.\n\nOperation gladio would conclude with the fall of the URSS and the exposing of the network to great public scandal prompting the europeans parlaments to launch full investigations on the matter.\n\nThroughout the 1990s, hundreds of Uyghurs were transported to Afghanistan by the CIA for training in guerrilla warfare by the mujahideen. Graham Fuller, CIA superspy, offered this explanation for radicalizing the Chinese Muslims:\n\n“ The policy of guiding the evolution of Islam and of helping them [Muslims] against our adversaries worked marvelously well in Afghanistan against the Red Army. The same doctrines can still be used to destabilize what remains of Russian power, and especially to counter the Chinese influence in Central Asia.”\n\nThis policy of destabilization was devised by Bernard Lewis, an Oxford University specialist on Islamic studies, who called for the creation of an “Arc of Crisis” around the southern borders of the Soviet Union by empowering Muslim radicals to rebel against their Communist overlords.\n\nThis new policy implemented after the end of the cold war would be aptly called “Gladio 2” and continues to this day.\n\nJuly 13, 2024\n\nPaul L. Williams has done a lot of research and given the subject, this was a brave act. He is to be saluted. This is the reason I’m giving his book 5 stars while citing a number of weaknesses.\n\nThe thesis is that after WWII, the newly formed CIA needed funds to fulfill its objectives (overturning governments it deemed insufficiently anticommunist). It could not approach Congress for funds since neither the funds, nor goals, would be approved. The CIA found the needed resources in the drug trade. Williams shows how CIA operatives exploited their contacts in the Vatican and the Italian based Mafia to get the extraordinary amount of money needed to go into this business and then to interfere with the governments of Guatemala, Iran and Chile to name a few.\n\nThe scale of the Gladio is astounding. There are a host of people in many countries (and continents) in production, transportation and distribution. The financing system, stemming from the Vatican’s Bank, is mind boggling. At the top of the operation you see how power/violence is used to protect the drugs and the financiers from prosecutors and honest politicians.\n\nThe text, like the operation, sprawls. The reader is somewhat helped by the format of labeled chapters with separated and labeled topics. Also helpful are the Chronology, the listing of the characters (”Leading Rogues”) and an excellent Index.\n\nThere were many crimes within the drug, financial and regime toppling crimes resulting in money for the rogues (i.e. investing deposits and using Madoff style accounting to credit losing investments to unwitting depositors and gains to the “rogues”) and violence (one of many examples was exposed 20 years after the fact is a kidnapping gone bad resulting in the dismemberment of its teenaged captive).\n\nSeveral issues, large and small, were clarified for me.\n\n---One large issue was mysterious death of John Paul I in 1978 (who was in good health and had served as Pope for only one month) and the assassination attempt on Pope John Paul II in 1981. The “Operation” had aroused suspicion of prosecutors and the press and there was fear that the Popes might expose the Vatican Bank. Evidence defies the official stories of \"natural causes\" (John Paul I) and the \"lone assassin\" who was prosecuted and put to death,\n\n--- another dramatic clarification is that it was Gladio operatives that kidnapped and killed Aldo Moro and not the communists (the \"Red Brigade') whom they framed.\n\n--- On the “small” side there was the resignation of Bert Lance from the (very clean) Carter administration. The story at the time was something about loans made by his family’s small bank in Georgia. According to Williams it was not the Georgia Bank, but BCCI, a bank founded in Karachi, as one of the many banks set up to hide/launder drug money transferred from the Vatican's Banking system.\n\nEarly on I spotted small errors and wondered how pervasive errors could be.\n\n---a Magoddino, but not Stefano (as claimed by Williams), attended the Apalachin meeting;\n\n--- it was the NY State Police that reported the meeting not PA State Police.\n\n--- the western NY mob was based in Niagara Falls not Buffalo (excused since everyone gets this one wrong).\n\nThese errors are not meaningful and episode had little bearing on Gladio. This part could have been edited out as could many such connected (at least in the text) episodes. These only sew confusion and exhaust the reader. The small errors make you wonder, even with great documentation, how much more inaccurate information is in this book and if that info is significant.\n\nI had problems when I started reading this due to the flood of information. There are a lot of dots that are not connected and there are loads of names for whom there is innuendo but no follow up. Once I stopped looking for connections it was a smoother read.\n\nAs noted above, there is a lot of information in this book. While not the best read, I give this 5 stars for the research and the bravery of Paul L. Williams.\n\nNovember 16, 2021\n\nOperation Gladio is a thorough telling of the behind-the-scenes cold war that started during WWII lasting into the 21st century. If you were not previously aware of Operation Gladio and the connections to the CIA your world view will change drastically. The focus of the book is the Vatican, the Mafia, the OSS and CIA, and Italy, one of the few places that actually investigated the anti-communist, far-right, facist underground armies.\n\nRight-wing terrorists committing mass murder in the name of communist groups and creating the opioid epidemic (which systematically and intentionally was targeting black neighborhoods) is, somehow, so thoroughly ignored and unacknowledged in American media that while you read you'll think you crossed into an alternate reality. In a weird way, there's so much evidence that you have to question how American politicians and journalists can be so willfully ignorant (or blatantly lying). American officials have acknowledged many parts of the story, but somehow the CIA gets away with just saying \"we can not confirm nor deny, matter of national security.\"\n\nThe reason we know any of this is a little bizarre: Italian officials stumbled upon evidence of the plots and their members while investigating banking-related crimes. Imagine how many plots there were across the world that were never found out, or were kept secret at the threat of (or actual) violence.\n\nMy only negative comment is that near the very end, it seemed to me the author started drifting into theories that had little to no evidence surrounding the last decade or so. Definitely be critically thinking as you read this.\n\nAudiobook narrated by Michael Prichard: I did not like the narration. There were many mispronounced words (in English) and occasionally the narrator would totally botch the flow of the sentence. It bothers some more than others but is overall listenable.\n\nFebruary 20, 2023\n\nLife is truly stranger than fiction.\n\nIt's an oft repeated slogan, but I don't know how else to summarize this book. If you really think that the garish circus of partisan politics is what really moves power blocs and geopolitics, the joke's on you. Paul Williams' Operation Gladio is what people should be learning in history classes, but undoubtedly won't.\n\nOperation Gladio is such a mind boggling account of deep politics and parapolitical scholarship, it beggars belief. This is a tale of skullduggery so sordid that you'd be tempted to think it was cooked up in a Hollywood screenwriter's hallucinatory fever dream. But the truth is that it’s light years beyond anything Hollywood ever produced. You could take every mob/narco warfare/espionage production and it still wouldn't compare to the revelations of this book.\n\nThe interconnection between the CIA, the mob, the Vatican, the narcotics industry, Islamic terrorist groups, right-wing militias, and international banking is more tightly woven than you can imagine.\n\nThe scope and the level of detail is too broad to summarize, but we're talking about a CIA/narco warfare/fifth column/black ops/money laundering geopolitical underpinning to every major event from the latter half of the 20th century to the present. Everything that Hollywood puts out makes sense now because all they're doing is working off what's really going on and layering over a thin veneer of fiction. Godfather Part 3, The International and The Sopranos are especially relevant to this narrative.\n\nAnd if you really think that the Ukraine/FTX debacle is really something totally organic, the joke's on you.\n\nJune 5, 2023\n\nOperation Gladio: The Unholy Alliance Between the Vatican, the CIA, and the Mafia is a book by Paul L. Williams that exposes the dark history of a secret network of paramilitary groups that operated in Europe after World War II. Gladio was the codename for these clandestine \"stay-behind\" operations of armed resistance that were organized by the Western Union (precursor of NATO) and the CIA, as a precautionary measure, in case the Axis overpowered the Allied forces. However, Germany and Italy were defeated, and the focus of the CIA and these groups immediately turned to the Soviet Union and communism.\n\nThe groups were involved in assassinations, coups, false flag attacks, and other covert operations across Europe to counter the perceived threat of communism. Williams draws on declassified documents, testimonies, and journalistic investigations to reveal that these groups were trained and funded by the CIA through drug money that was laundered clean through the Vatican bank.\n\nThe book is a comprehensive and well-researched account of a controversial and complex topic. Williams does not shy away from exposing the crimes and corruption of powerful institutions and individuals, providing ample evidence and sources to back up his claims. He also explores the historical and political context of Gladio's emergence and evolution, showing how it influenced the course of European and global history. The book is very informative, I would say more suited for scholars than for popular reading. While the book unravels a web of intrigue, conspiracy, and violence that spans through decades and across continents, it is bogged down in too much detail to be thrilling and captivating.\n\nThe book should appeal to anyone interested in history, politics, the Catholic Church, espionage, and or crime. It is a book that will make the reader challenge their own assumptions and question what they know about the morals of the US government and the Roman Catholic church. It is a book that will expose the reader to a hidden reality that is both fascinating and frightening.\n\nJanuary 27, 2021\n\nPaul L. Williams's, \"Operation Gladio\", is written so that even the braindead reader such as myself can grasp the totality of the madness that is Operation Gladio, an all-too real conspiracy that began as the allied forces were on their way to victory and went into full force in post WW2 Europe and anywhere on the planet either supplying or buying heroin. Williams's book shows how the funds from heroin went into the creation of the CIA (and all the forces and personalities, as well), to right-wing extremists posing as communists in Italy and around the globe murdered countless people to stop any advances from communists to gain power, and, of course, the connection to the Vatican and in particular the Vatican bank.\n\nWhile this doesn't read like other more scholarly texts concerning this and other issues related to it, that fact makes for this book to be the perfect starter for those unfamiliar with Gladio.\n\nIf there's one complaint: after Gladio, allegedly, came to an end, the author proposes that it's still active - and it is - in the guise of the new war on terror. While I don't disagree, I find some of his assertions lacking the sufficient evidence such wild claims require. However, evidence is in abundance throughout the entirety of this book save for the final chapter.\n\nDecember 12, 2018\n\nThe most amazing book. It unravels CIA covert operations ever since the end of WWII and especially the illegial finacing of these by encouraging new plantation of drugs and initiating a drug trade which with the help of major banks - including ones in the US and not least the Vatican - whitewashed these funds.\n\nEverything spurred on by a fear of communism.\n\nA lot of Italian \"incidents\" were financed and organised through this covert arm of the CIA (Operation Gladio), as well as in other European countries, most notable financial help to the Solidarity movement in Poland. Who would think they were financed by whitewashed drug money organised by the CIA?\n\nWho did the people of Operation Gladio involve, well not just the mafia, but very high ranking people across Europe, not least inside the Vatican.\n\nA must read for anyone interested in European history in the 20th century.\n\nMay 28, 2022\n\nI'm conflicted about rating this book. If even half of what it describes is true, it is a revelation about the complicity of the CIA, US government, and Vatican in political subversion, relentless terrorist attacks, and the explosion of the international drug trade after WWII. I know, I know. Too preposterous to be believed. The book is well foot-noted, but many of the sources are other books, so it's difficult to determine the veracity of all the claims. Still, those episodes that have been previously exposed (CIA support for the Pinochet coup in Chile, Iran-Contra affair, etc.) provide an overall air of authenticity. This may not be the \"vast right-wing conspiracy\" that Hillary Clinton was referring to, but it sure deserves the epithet.\n\nMarch 5, 2023\n\nA fascinating book chronicling NATO atrocities and how they were funded. An expose of the genocides and war crimes of the Anglo-American Establishment. Definitely filled a few gaps in my knowledge. I was, for ecample, aware of CIA heroine dealing in American inner cities to fund black projects. This filled in the details. Similarly, this book gives a plausible theory as to why the Clinton Administration provided the weaponry to the Turks to genocide the Kurds.\n\nThis fits in the pattern well considering I'm very aware of NATO support of genocidal factions in Syria - since my Church was a primary target of that. And although not addressed in this book, the geopolitical shenanigans definitely carry out to NATO's coup, church persecution, and the current war in Ukraine.\n\nSeptember 14, 2019\n\nthere's a lot of interesting information in this book but I felt it wasn't as buttoned up & cautious as Valentine or Webb so I m staying a little cautious. Author also seemed to me to, at the end, show he's somewhat of an islamophobe though, tbh, that stuff is of a piece with the way the book puts catholics/vactican out front moreso than CIA. Not in an awful way as the author isn't excluding CIA. I think he just has a perspective on supra-government entities and organized crime that I'm not convinced isn't slightly reversed and that's without getting into how it's ALL just capitalism at work. Regardless, those are quibbles and the significant amount of indisputable information you will gather from the book makes it a worthwhile read.\n\nFebruary 25, 2020\n\nThis story, if it is even remotely true, is very highly disturbing. It completely undermines one's faith in the entire Catholic Church and the US Government, both, who seem to have aligned themselves with organized crime, laid the ground work for and fertilized the Opioid Crisis, amongst other illicit drug epidemics, and seem to have been behind conflicts in Asia, Europe, and the Middle East, to name a few. They seem to have found themselves on both sides of Osama Ben Laden at different points in his existence.\n\nIts hard to believe that this is all true and connected but its also hard to believe that its all contrived.\n\nSeptember 27, 2023\n\nCrazy book. Lots of wild information about how the CIA, the vatican, the mob, and the masonic temple all worked together to defeat communism. It does read a bit like a textbook and the guy doing the audio book doesn’t really help that feeling at all. It also seems to get too into conspiracy theories, but then every time I look something up it seems to be true. So it is pretty wild. The weird thing is that I knew all these groups were self-serving and bad people, but I never really considered they would work together. Except for the masonic temple I thought that whole thing was kind of a big joke. But it just turns out that they don’t do anything anymore.\n\nThis entire review has been hidden because of spoilers.\n\nJuly 26, 2020\n\nYou can really sense Williams struggling beneath the scope of this story. It's written in such a dry, encyclopedic voice that it's hard to come to grips with how terrible Gladio and the P2 were. I hate being the type of person to decry a book as \"boring\" but this felt more like an academic text than the piece of investigative journalism it promises to be. However, I have to give some serious points for objectivity as Williams (a catholic) does not shy away from being overtly critical of John Paul II, Ratzinger, Bergoglio, and the Church in general.\n\nRead\n\nFebruary 5, 2021\n\nAnother eye-opening book casting light on several stories that were in the news only briefly. This is the state of our society. The greatest crimes are undertaken right under our noses. We are indoctrinated to believe that past a certain level people will simply not be punished for massive crimes affecting millions of people. People have given up. They praise a pope who was in bed with the junta running the 'Dirty War' in Argentina or massive money laundering operations handled by the Vatican Bank. Just who are these paragons of piety serving? Not you and me -- that is for sure.\n\nApril 6, 2022\n\nI hope this book gets a new edition at some point, because the format is a large hindrance to clarity & legibility. But the information contained within this book is tremendously important and contextualizes so many contemporary geopolitical conflicts, especially the so-called “Uyghur genocide” in Xinjiang (spoiled alert: Xinjiang has more crude oil reserves than Saudi Arabia, and we all know what the US is gonna do when there are oil reserves to be had!). Power through the bizarre formatting & occasional typo - it’s definitely worth it."
