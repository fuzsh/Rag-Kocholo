        "text": "The Dutch Stay-Behind Organisation during the Cold War\n\nIn the Netherlands, a secret stay-behind organisation (SBO) was formed just after WWII had ended, in 1946 or 1947. For many years, this organisation was known as O&I, the abbreviation of Operatiën en Inlichtingen (Operations and Intelligence) 1 although it was also known under other names. Nevertheless, the organisation is often (wrongly) identified as Gladio, after the Italian branch of the SBO.\n\nAlthough O&I had a good relationship with NATO and with sister organisations in other countries, like Germany, Belgium and the UK, it was the only fully autonomous and fully self-controlled stay-behind organisation in Europe. It was neither controlled by NATO, nor by any other foreign agency, including MI6 and the CIA [5].\n\nEach agent had a set of manuals, coded information about agents, transmission schedules, code material, financial means (e.g. money and gold), a radio transmitter and receiver (spy radio set) and sometimes a weapon and ammunition. These items were usually stored inside one or more containers that were hidden by the agent, e.g. in the attic or burried in the garden. Some of this material was also stored in other places, known as caches, both in The Netherlands and abroad.\n\nIn total, between 100 and 200 agents were involved in the Dutch network, which consisted of a staff and field agents [1]. The staff of ± 20 people was involved with organisational tasks, administration and instruction and training of field agents. In the event of a war with the Warsaw Pact countries, the staff would be moved to a safe base in the UK, North America or Canada.\n\nThe field agents were divided into organisers and operators. An organiser was specialised in reconnaissance, forging ID papers, sabotage, information gathering, psychologic warfare, organising illegal press, etc. In the event of a war, the organiser would autonomously built his own clandestine network. Each organiser was assigned an operator who maintained contact with the staff abroad. The operator was specialised in operating the radio equipment, coding and decoding messages, sending burst messages in morse code and preventing interception and direction finding. Initially, the agents would operate in pairs (organiser and operator), but later, when automatic radio stations were deployed, the single-agent concept was introduced [5].\n\nIn 1990, after stories about subversive actions by the Italian SBO 'GLADIO' had reached the press, Dutch Prime Minister Ruud Lubbers confirmed the existence of a Dutch SBO. He also stated that, unlike the other SBOs, the Dutch organisation was autonomous and was not controlled by NATO, MI6 or the CIA. Less than two years later, he saw himself forced to dismantle the organisation.\n\nAlthough the official name for the Dutch SBO was O&I, it is sometimes referred to as I&O, even by people who worked for the organisation [5] and by government officials [10]. In 1985, the name was changed to A&B, but the old names O&I and I&O also remained in use. In the scope of this page we will use O&I.\n\nOnce the war was over, Somer rejuventated his GS III C section, albeit in a less ambitious form than he had anticipated. The section was actually the post-war variant of the wartime BI. For the stay-behind division of his section, he needed communication equipment. After using a variety of Army surplus equipment (mainly from Belgian stores), he managed to secure a budget of NLG 20,000 (EUR 9100), for the development of the first (and only) Dutch spy radio set: the ZO-47.\n\nThe order for the development was given by Somer in 1946 to Philips/NSF. Development took most of 1947 and by the end of that year the radio was ready for its first field test. In early 1948, the first batch of 100 units was delivered to the BI. By that time, Somer had already been appointed head of intelligence in the Dutch Indies and was succeeded by J.J.L. baron van Lynden. This intelligence section (i.e. the former BI) would later become known as the 'I'-service.\n\n➤ More about Jan Marginus Somer\n\n➤ More about the ZO-47 radio set When he conveyed his plans to the Dutch Royal Commander-in-Chief Prins Bernhard, the latter put him in contact with Louis Einthoven, the newly appointed head of the Dutch Bureau of National Security (BNV, later: BVD, now: AIVD).\n\nEinthoven was easily convinced and allowed him to setup an effective operations unit which was actually the post-war varant of the wartime BBO.\n\nThe new organisation did not officially exist and became the direct responsibility of the Dutch Prime Minister. This secret operations section would later become known as the 'O'-service.\n\n➤ More about Henk Veeneklaas During the first years, the 'O' and 'I' service operated independently from each other, without each of them knowing about the other's existence. The I-service was controlled by the Ministry of Defense and reported directly to the Minister. The O-service on the other hand, fell under the Ministry of General Affairs and reported only to the the Prime Minister. Around 1948, the SBOs in various European countries formed the Western Union Clandestine Committee (WUCC) in which thoughts were exchanged about the theoretical structure of a stay-behind organisation. In 1961, the first attempts were made to merge the activities of the O-service and the I-service0. This plan met with strong opposition from the founder and initial leader of the O-service, Henk Veeneklaas. He argued that the two services were too different to be merged. In his opinion, the I-service was a military organisation whilst the O-service was purely a civil one. In 1967, the problem was solved by discharging the heads of both services and appointing a new coordinator. From this moment on, the Dutch clandestine service was known as O&I (sometimes called I&O by its members), with the two services working independently, but under supervision of the coordinator. The main office of the organisation was housed in villa Maarheeze in Wassenaar (near The Hague) under the cover of the Foreign Intelligence Service (IDB). The former BI (by now the I-service) was housed here since May 1945.\n\nThe image on the right shows villa Maarheeze in later years (2014). It is currently used as a high-profile office building and can be rented. There were other incidents that reached the press, such as the discovery of a large amount of weapons with Dutch criminals Sam Klepper en John Mieremet in Alkmaar (Netherlands) on 29 August 1991. According to some newspapers, these weapons were robbed from a cache in The Hague (Scheveningse Bosjes). In 1983/84 the robbery was discovered and reported to the police, but it was decided not to take any further action. Although it was suggested that the stay-behind network was involved in this criminal activity, no proof to support this claim was ever found [5].\n\nIn 2007, the Dutch Minister of Defense confirmed to the Dutch Parliament that the weapons cache had indeed been robbed but that a recent investigation had revealed that the weapons found with the criminals were of a different brand and/or model than those taken from the cache [10]. From the beginning of the clandestine network, the organisation had used a wide variety of radio equipment, mainly from Dutch, UK, US and German origin. This equipment is described in detail further down this page. While suitable for communication between agents and the government in exile, it was largely incompatible with the equipment used by SBOs in other European countries.\n\nIn the early 1980s, the Allied Clandestine Committee, or ACC — attached to NATO headquarters SHAPE in Mons (Belgium) — approved the development of a pan-European communication system for all European stay-behind organisations, including some neutral countries such as Sweden and Switzerland. The new clandestine radio station was developed by manufacturer AEG Telefunken in München (Germany) — in close cooperation with MI6 in the UK — under the codename HARPOON. As the Dutch O&I urgently needed a replacement for the ageing FSS-7, and the new HARPOON radio sets were not expected any time soon, the Racal PRM-4150 (TITHE) was choosen as an intermediate solution. It was already in use with the British Armed Forces, the Diplomatic Wireless Service (DWS) and stay-behind, and had a proven track record. It became known as the DZO-81; Data Zend-Ontvanger (data transceiver) 1981.\n\nIt consisted of a transmitter, a receiver, an automatic antenna tuner and a coding device, mounted together in a Samsonite briefcase. The DZO-81 no longer required the ability to send and receive messages in morse code, as the coding unit could automatically send and receive messages at pre-determinded time schedules. As a result, separate radio operators were no longer required and the organisation adopted the single-agent concept, in which the intelligence agent (i.e. the organiser) also operated the radio.\n\nBy the late 1980s, the new HARPOON system, developed by AEG Telefunken, was ready to replace all existing clandestine radio sets in Europe. By this time, the Berlin Wall had already fallen (1989) and the Soviet Union was about to collapse (1991). As a result, HARPOON would be the final set. The official designator of the HARPOON system was FS-5000, but in the Netherlands it was known as AZO-90, short for: Automatische Zender-Ontvanger (automatic transceiver) 1990. The AEG-Telefunken designator was SY-5000.\n\nIn total, The Netherlands received 110 HARPOON units between 1988 and 1990. The initial five units were received in November 1988. Two of these were used for training operators. The next shipment of 35 units was received in December 1988 [4]. The remaining 70 were received in the 2nd half of 1989 and in the 1st quarter of 1990. In 1990, the first international Long Range (LOR) tests were carried out, and the results with the FS-5000 sets were promising. By March 1991, all sets ordered by the various countries had been delivered. As the Dutch organisation had already developed a computer system and software for secure message processing — back in 1989 — the Netherlands became the first country with a fully automated FS-5000 store-and-forward message handling system [4].\n\nThe LOR tests and the software deveopment took place at NEBAS, the Dutch base station at Villa Maarheeze in Wassenaar (near The Hague) where O&I had been located since the beginning, under the cover of the Dutch Foreign Intelligence Service (Inlichtendienst Buitenland, or IDB). In December 1991, NEBAS was moved to a more convenient location with less public exposure in Utrecht where a completely new building had been erected at the premisis of the KMar, the Royal Dutch Military Police, at Fort De Bilt. Here they were able to install a large Log-Periodic antenna. In 1985, after the discovery of the weapons caches near Heythuysen (1980) and Rheden (1983), the organisation was reorganised. It was decided that the caches would be cleared and would only be refilled when there was actually a clear threat of war. In the meantime, the weapons and explosives were under control of the Dutch Military Police (Koninklijke Marechaussee, or KMar).\n\nAt the same time, the organisation was renamed to A en B (A and B), with A being the former O (Operations) and B being the old I-branch (Intelligence). Nevertheless, most people kept using the old name O&I. In order to avoid confusion, the tasks of the two branches were reconfirmed by (then) Prime Minister Ruud Lubbers as follows:\n\nA-service (Operations)\n\nB-service (Intelligence) Despite the various incidents with caches in the 1980s, the existence of the organistion remained secret for a long time. All that changed when in 1990 the Italian SBO 'GLADIO' started appearing in the headlines. Gladio was suspected of involvement with some ultra right-wing incidents and terrorist attacks. As a result, (then) Italian Prime Minister Guilio admitted on 3 August 1990 the existence of a secret SBO – named Gladio – and revealed that it operated under NATO control.\n\nThe indicents raised international public awareness of the secret organisations, and resulted in a series of public hearings and investigations in countries like Germany, Belgium, Switzerland and The Netherlands. On 13 November 1990, Dutch Prime Minister Ruud Lubbers publicly confirmed the existence of a Dutch SBO, but emphasized that it was completely independent and was not (and had never been) under control of NATO, MI6, the CIA or any other foreign organisation. After the fall of the Berlin Wall in 1989 and the subsequent collapse of the Soviet Union (USSR) in 1991, the threat of a possible Soviet invasion was no longer deemed realistic and the necessesity for a secret stay behind organisation had more or less disappeared. Meanwhile, in 1990, the new European HARPOON radio system (AZO-90, FS-5000) had become available and The Netherlands was the first country to to have implemented a fully automated message handling system.\n\nIn 1991, it became evident that the existing premises in Wassenaar attracted too much attention. In December of that year the Dutch base station NEBAS was moved to a more convenient location at Fort de Bilt (near Utrecht). Despite all this, Prime Minister Lubbers felt he had no other option than to shut down the entire operation. In 1992, he sent a personal letter to the agents of both services in which he thanked them for their loyalty and insisted that any details remained secret.\n\nMembers of the A-service (the former 'O') also received a personal letter from Prins Bernhard who said he had warm feelings for the organisation and had followed them with great interest from 1942 until now (1992). The administrative closure took until 1994, but once that was handled, the secret Dutch SBO was history. The former members receive a small pension for their services, which is handled by the Quia Oportet Trust. 1 An example of such a former agent is Herman Schoemaker from Soest (Netherlands). He was a radio instructor at O&I – the Dutch SBO – and worked for the network from the early 1960s right until the end in 1992. In June 2013 he graduated at the University of Utrecht with a thesis on the Dutch stay-behind O&I [5].\n\nOn the last opening day of our special exhibition Secret Communications, in Duivendrecht (near Amsterdam) in November and December 2013, we had the honour of meeting Schoemaker and listen to his exiting Cold War stories first hand.\n\nTo our surprise, he was accompanied by two other former agents who were involved in the same type of work. Although one of them was an old friend of Schoemaker, he only learned about his involvement in the network when he accidently recognized his voice during a training.\n\nSchoemaker was trained as a radio specialist and he in turn trained other agents in the use of the various radio sets. During the early days (i.e. in the early 1960s) this involved using morse code and the use of the FSS-7 (SP-15) spy radio set and its burst encoders. Especially the use of morse code, the transmission frequency schedules and the use of the cryptographic code material, required a long and intensive training, something that was greatly reduced when the automatic DZO-81 and later the fully digital AZO-90 (FS-5000, HARPOON) radio sets were introduced.\n\n➤ Review of Herman Schoemaker's visit\n\nOver the years, the Dutch stay-behind organisation used a variety of radio sets, ranging from wartime valve-based British spy radio sets, to fully automatic digital long-range radio stations with built-in encryption. Below is an overview of all radio sets that are known to have been used in this context in The Netherlands. Please note that not all O&I personnel will have used all of these radios in an operational context. The use of the following sets has been confirmed. The Mark VII, commonly known as the Paraset, was developed in the UK around 1941, and was used during WWII by agents that were dropped over occupied territory. It is either housed in a metal or a wooden enclosure, and required the valves (tubes) to be removed before transport.\n\nThe Paraset was one of the most dangerous radio sets produced by the British. In reception mode, the signal from its local oscillator was strong enough for the Germans to locate the agent by means of Radio Direction Finding (RDF).\n\n➤ More information\n\nAnother left-over from WWII that was used by the Dutch SBO, is the British Mk.119. It was developed in late 1940 by HMGCC (now: GCHQ) at Hanslope Park (UK), and was also used by Special Forces (SF) and by the British Diplomatic Wireless Service (DWS) for communication with the British Embassies overseas.\n\nThe radio was available in two versions: a three-piece solution in which transmitter, receiver and power supply unit (PSU) were each housed in a separate container, and a single-piece variant in a wooden case, shown in the image on the right.\n\nThe B2, A3 and Mk.119 were the last wartime long-range radio sets that were used by the Dutch SBO, before moving to newly developed post-war equipment from Dutch, German and American manufacturers.\n\n➤ More information"
