        "text": "Ready to dive into the thrilling world of spies and secret missions? Our list of the top non-fiction spy books, chosen by real-life intelligence operatives from the CIA, FBI, Mossad, and the KGB, will transport you into the heart of the action.\n\nFrom Cold War conflicts to modern-day espionage, these books have it all. Enjoy!\n\n50. The CIA Manual of Trickery and Deception by John Mulholland\n\nAmong the many tricks the CIA had at its disposal during the Cold War was a top-secret manual of deception written by magician John Mulholland, a stage performer who honed his skills trading tricks in the back of New York City's Martinka magic shop. The CIA paid Mulholland $3,000 to write its guide toÂ trickery and deception - a \"James Bond meets Harry Houdini\" textbook, as master magician Lance Burton described it. All copies were thought to have been destroyed in 1975, but two intelligence agents managed to get their hands on the document and published it decades later.\n\n49. Life Undercover: Coming of Age in the CIA by Amaryllis Fox\n\nâWeâre impossibly young to have the fate of the world in our hands,â Amaryllis Fox writes in Life Undercover, noting she started as a 21-year-old CIA analyst and became an undercover officer. âSuch is the way of the Agency. By 35, any operative worth their salt has gone hard enough at their job to erode their cover.â Foxâs memoir is a fast-paced thriller that reads like fiction but the description of Foxâs training at the Farm alone is worth the ride.\n\n48. The KGBâs Poison Factory From Lenin to Litvinenko by Boris Volodarsky\n\nRussian spy Alexander Litvinenko died weeks after drinking tea spiked with radioactive polonium-210 in 2006. The former FSS Lt. Colonel certainly wasnât the first or last victim to blame his murder on Moscow. In The KGBâs Poison Factory, former Russian military intelligence officer Boris Volodarsky traces the history of poison assassinations dating back to 1917 and Leninâs Cheka secret police and covers 20 ghastly deaths.Â\n\n47. The Accidental Spy by Tracy Walder\n\nâFormer sorority sister Tracy Walder wanted to teach history after USC but joined the CIA instead. Her job? Travel the globe post 9/11 and disrupt al-Qaeda plots. The many men Tracy encountered along the way often underestimated the young blonde in a pink pashmina but certainly not for long. Walder, The Accidental Spy, eventually joined the FBI to fight the enemy on her home turf, revealing a husband-and-wife team sending military secrets to China. A riveting read.\n\n46. Operation Gladio by Paul L. Williams\n\nHistory jumps off the page in journalist Paul L. Williamsâ disturbing exposÃ© Operation Gladio, the story of a post-WWII alliance forged by the CIA, the Sicilian and US mafias, and the Vatican to battle a feared Communist invasion of Europe. Williams details the âstay-behindâ military units and makes the case that the units were used in South America and NATO-based countries to disrupt left-wing movements.Â\n\n45. The CASSIA Spy Ring in World War II Austria by C. Turnerâ\n\nWritten by a former undercover CIA officer, The CASSIA Spy Ring explores Americaâs most effective spy ring in Austria, Germany's neighbor. This gripping account of CASSIA describes its contributions to the Allied war effort, including reports on the V-2 missile, Nazi death camps, and advanced combat aircraft. Meticulously researched, Turnerâs story is one of espionage, betrayal, and behind-the-scenes work to stop the Nazis.\n\n44. Scorpionsâ Dance Jefferson Morley\n\nCan there possibly be an untold story about the 1972 Watergate break-in? Yes, Morley proves there is much to reveal about the power struggle between President Richard Nixon and his CIA Director Richard Helms, two men who shared the deadly secrets that ended a presidency. They circle each other in a Scorpions' Dance. âWe protected Helms from one hell of a lot of things,â Nixon growled on one of his infamous Watergate tapes. âYou open that scab thereâs a hell of a lot of things.â\n\nâ\n\nâ\n\n43. Behind Enemy Lines by Marthe Cohn\n\nâMarthe Cohn lost members of her family during WWII and felt she had nothing to live for when Marthe slipped Behind Enemy Lines disguised as a German nurse intent on spying for France and its WWII Allies. Supposedly, Marthe was searching for her Nazi fiance but the unlikely Jewish spy was really gathering intel on German positions that ended up saving hundreds of lives. Cohn kept her story a secret until she was 80.Â\n\n42. Abyss: The Cuban Missile Crisis 1962 by Max Hastings\n\nMax Hasting has come up with another bestseller examining the â60s missile crisis. As the Americans and the Soviets stare into the Abyss, contemplating the threat of nuclear war, Hastings' story unfolds through many eyes including the national leaders and American pilots. His research is astonishing and Hastings deservedly retains his position as a master historian.Â\n\n41. The Entity: Five Centuries of Secret Vatican Espionage by Eric Frattini\n\nEric Frattini unravels the Vaticanâs secret spy service known as the Holy Alliance, and later The Entity, which has served 40 Popes and carried out policies from schisms to persecutions and allegedly even kidnappings. SPYSCAPE agrees with Spanish newspaper El PaÃ­s, who describe The Entity as: âA true story that surpasses any novel by John le CarrÃ©.â\n\n40. Iran: The Untold Story by Mohamed Heikal\n\nArab journalist Mohamed Heikal offers an insightful look at Iran, the Shah, andÂ Ayatollah Khomeini. The book also serves as an introduction to The Safari Club - sometimes referred to as âthe second CIAâ for its off-the-books operations at a time when US President Jimmy Carter and the Church Commission were clipping the Agencyâs wings. Iran: The Untold Story lives up to its title.\n\n39. Active Measures - The Secret History of Disinformation and Political Warfare by Thomas Rid\n\nActive Measures details Russian disinformation campaigns from the early 1920's up to the 2016 US Presidential campaign. SPYEX Consultant Peter Warmka, a former senior intelligence officer with the CIA, describes the book as very insightful: âIt has helped me exercise greater critical thinking when evaluating various sources of news media.â You may also want to check out Warmkaâs own book, Confessions of a CIA Spy - The Art of Human Hacking.Â\n\nâ\n\nâ\n\n38. Case by Case: A US Army Counterintelligence Agent in WWII by Ib MelchiorÂ\n\nIb Melchior, a former operative with the OSS and the US Army Counter Intelligence Corps., recalls his time as a counterespionage agent in Case by Case. He recounts how CIC agents were trained to search out spies and saboteurs and work behind enemy lines. His daring experiences are the plots for his many bestsellers, including Order of Battle: Hitler's Werewolves, and Sleeper Agent.\n\n37. Invisible Ink by Guy Stern\n\nGuy Stern was a Ritchie Boy, sent from Ft. Richie, Maryland to the front line to interrogate German PoWs and his humanity and empathy that shines through the 13 chapters of his incredible memoir Invisible Ink. His story begins with the meeting of Stern's parents and the Naziâs rise to power. Stern immigrated to the US at 15 and was drafted into the US Army, soon finding himself selected for a special military intelligence unit. He returned to a career as a scholar, author, and decorated veteran.\n\n36. The Search for the Manchurian Candidate by John D. Marks\n\nThe Search for the Manchurian Candidate is the dark story of the CIAâs mind-control experiments and an era of seemingly unrestrained human experimentation. It is likely the most well-researched and shocking account of Cold War CIA operations ever written.\n\nâ\n\nâ\n\n35. Moscow Rules by Antonio and Jonna Mendez\n\nAntonio Mendez and his wife, Jonna, bring us inside the US Embassy in Moscow where US officers fear the walls have eyes as well as ears. The couple - both CIA heads of technical services during their careers - have written one of the most interesting books about the Cold War era along with the Moscow Rules officers observed to protect intelligence sources.Â\n\n34. All the Shah's Men by Stephen Kinzer\n\nâFormer CIA officer and Russia expert Alex Finley rates All the Shah's Men by Stephen Kinzer, about the CIA's overthrow of Iranian Prime Minister Mohammad Mossadegh in order to install the Shah. Finley, the author of the Victor Caro series of books, said All the Shah's Men reads like a spy novel but uncovers fascinating historical details.\n\n33. The Wonga Coup by Adam Roberts\n\nAnother of Alex Finleyâs favorites is The Wonga Coup: Guns, Thugs, and the Steely Determination to Create Mayhem. The book digs into the intrigue around an attempted coup in oil-rich Equatorial Guinea in 2004 which made headlines over the alleged involvement of British PM Margaret Thatcher's son, Mark.\n\n32. The Big Breach by Richard Tomlinson\n\nThe Big Breach is the story of an MI6 officer recruited at Cambridge by the British foreign intelligence service. Richard Tomlinson's descriptions of his MI6 training are insightful and amusing but the book takes a dark turn. Tomlinson also smuggled nuclear secrets out of Moscow and ran a Sarajevo undercover operation before he was fired and jailed in one of Britain's toughest maximum security prisons. From start to finish, itâs a page-turner.Â\n\n31. Need to Know by Nicholas Reynoldsâ\n\nSPYEX consultant John.R. Seeger, an expert on counterintelligence and insider threats, considers Nick Reynolds' Need to Know the best book of 2022. âThis book covers the growth and transformation of US intelligence during WWII from a small group of boutique offices run by amateurs to an intelligence community ready to fight in the Cold War.âÂ\n\n30. The Art of Intelligence by Hank Crumpton\n\nRecommended by SPYEX consultant Doug Patteson, a former CIA operations officer, The Art of Intelligence is told by the officer who led the CIA's global covert operations against terrorists including al-Qaeda. Crumptonâs book combines thoughtful meditation with old-school spycraft in a lively and accessible way.\n\nâ\n\nâ\n\n29. The President's Book of Secrets by David Priessâ\n\nFor decades, the US president has received a distilled, top-secret daily intelligence report citing global threats and opportunities known as âthe Bookâ in national security circles. The details of most Presidential Daily Briefings are classified but The Book of Secrets explores how power operates at the highest levels. David Priess, a former daily briefer, also offers a window into presidential decision-making.\n\n28. The Triple Agent: the Al-Qaeda Mole who Infiltrated the CIA by Joby Warrick\n\nLindsay Moran, a former CIA officer and expert on covert ops, intelligence, and disinformation, recommends The Triple Agent as âvery solid journalismâ, adding that Washington Post journalist Joby Warrick âmanaged to tell a complex, nuanced story while safeguarding any information that should not have made it to the public lightâ. Moran has also penned her own memoir, Blowing My Cover.\n\n27. A State of Mind by Rolf Mowatt-Larssen\n\nEx-CIA officer James Lawler, an expert on WMDs, counterintelligence, and insider threats, recommends A State of Mind by Rolf Mowatt-Larssen as an âincisive, no-holds-barred look at an intelligence officer's spiritual evolutionâ. Mowatt-Larssenâs memoir is also a journey of faith in the post-9/11 world.\n\n26. Honorable Men by William Colby\n\nHonorable Men is two books in one. In the first half, Colby recounts his career of covert action in WWII and afterward in Sweden, Italy, and Vietnam. The latter half of the book sees Colby move into senior command and portrays his wider perspective in 1970s America.

Circle of Treason by Sandra Grimes and Jeanne VertefeuilleÂ\n\nDoug Patteson, a former CIA operations officer certified in Humint collection and counterterrorism, is an avid reader and author who contributed to More Stories From Langley.

Enjoy!\n\n50. The CIA Manual of Trickery and Deception by John Mulholland\n\nAmong the many tricks the CIA had at its disposal during the Cold War was a top-secret manual of deception written by magician John Mulholland, a stage performer who honed his skills trading tricks in the back of New York City's Martinka magic shop. The CIA paid Mulholland $3,000 to write its guide toÂ trickery and deception - a \"James Bond meets Harry Houdini\" textbook, as master magician Lance Burton described it. All copies were thought to have been destroyed in 1975, but two intelligence agents managed to get their hands on the document and published it decades later.\n\n49. Life Undercover: Coming of Age in the CIA by Amaryllis Fox\n\nâWeâre impossibly young to have the fate of the world in our hands,â Amaryllis Fox writes in Life Undercover, noting she started as a 21-year-old CIA analyst and became an undercover officer. âSuch is the way of the Agency. By 35, any operative worth their salt has gone hard enough at their job to erode their cover.â Foxâs memoir is a fast-paced thriller that reads like fiction but the description of Foxâs training at the Farm alone is worth the ride.\n\n48. The KGBâs Poison Factory From Lenin to Litvinenko by Boris Volodarsky\n\nRussian spy Alexander Litvinenko died weeks after drinking tea spiked with radioactive polonium-210 in 2006. The former FSS Lt. Colonel certainly wasnât the first or last victim to blame his murder on Moscow. In The KGBâs Poison Factory, former Russian military intelligence officer Boris Volodarsky traces the history of poison assassinations dating back to 1917 and Leninâs Cheka secret police and covers 20 ghastly deaths.Â\n\n47. The Accidental Spy by Tracy Walder\n\nâFormer sorority sister Tracy Walder wanted to teach history after USC but joined the CIA instead. Her job? Travel the globe post 9/11 and disrupt al-Qaeda plots. The many men Tracy encountered along the way often underestimated the young blonde in a pink pashmina but certainly not for long. Walder, The Accidental Spy, eventually joined the FBI to fight the enemy on her home turf, revealing a husband-and-wife team sending military secrets to China. A riveting read.\n\n46. Operation Gladio by Paul L. Williams\n\nHistory jumps off the page in journalist Paul L. Williamsâ disturbing exposÃ© Operation Gladio, the story of a post-WWII alliance forged by the CIA, the Sicilian and US mafias, and the Vatican to battle a feared Communist invasion of Europe. Williams details the âstay-behindâ military units and makes the case that the units were used in South America and NATO-based countries to disrupt left-wing movements.Â\n\n45. The CASSIA Spy Ring in World War II Austria by C. Turnerâ\n\nWritten by a former undercover CIA officer, The CASSIA Spy Ring explores Americaâs most effective spy ring in Austria, Germany's neighbor. This gripping account of CASSIA describes its contributions to the Allied war effort, including reports on the V-2 missile, Nazi death camps, and advanced combat aircraft. Meticulously researched, Turnerâs story is one of espionage, betrayal, and behind-the-scenes work to stop the Nazis.\n\n44. Scorpionsâ Dance Jefferson Morley\n\nCan there possibly be an untold story about the 1972 Watergate break-in? Yes, Morley proves there is much to reveal about the power struggle between President Richard Nixon and his CIA Director Richard Helms, two men who shared the deadly secrets that ended a presidency. They circle each other in a Scorpions' Dance. âWe protected Helms from one hell of a lot of things,â Nixon growled on one of his infamous Watergate tapes. âYou open that scab thereâs a hell of a lot of things.â\n\nâ\n\nâ\n\n43. Behind Enemy Lines by Marthe Cohn\n\nâMarthe Cohn lost members of her family during WWII and felt she had nothing to live for when Marthe slipped Behind Enemy Lines disguised as a German nurse intent on spying for France and its WWII Allies. Supposedly, Marthe was searching for her Nazi fiance but the unlikely Jewish spy was really gathering intel on German positions that ended up saving hundreds of lives. Cohn kept her story a secret until she was 80.Â\n\n42. Abyss: The Cuban Missile Crisis 1962 by Max Hastings\n\nMax Hasting has come up with another bestseller examining the â60s missile crisis. As the Americans and the Soviets stare into the Abyss, contemplating the threat of nuclear war, Hastings' story unfolds through many eyes including the national leaders and American pilots. His research is astonishing and Hastings deservedly retains his position as a master historian.Â\n\n41. The Entity: Five Centuries of Secret Vatican Espionage by Eric Frattini\n\nEric Frattini unravels the Vaticanâs secret spy service known as the Holy Alliance, and later The Entity, which has served 40 Popes and carried out policies from schisms to persecutions and allegedly even kidnappings. SPYSCAPE agrees with Spanish newspaper El PaÃ­s, who describe The Entity as: âA true story that surpasses any novel by John le CarrÃ©.â\n\n40. Iran: The Untold Story by Mohamed Heikal\n\nArab journalist Mohamed Heikal offers an insightful look at Iran, the Shah, andÂ Ayatollah Khomeini. The book also serves as an introduction to The Safari Club - sometimes referred to as âthe second CIAâ for its off-the-books operations at a time when US President Jimmy Carter and the Church Commission were clipping the Agencyâs wings. Iran: The Untold Story lives up to its title.\n\n39. Active Measures - The Secret History of Disinformation and Political Warfare by Thomas Rid\n\nActive Measures details Russian disinformation campaigns from the early 1920's up to the 2016 US Presidential campaign. SPYEX Consultant Peter Warmka, a former senior intelligence officer with the CIA, describes the book as very insightful: âIt has helped me exercise greater critical thinking when evaluating various sources of news media.â You may also want to check out Warmkaâs own book, Confessions of a CIA Spy - The Art of Human Hacking.Â\n\nâ\n\nâ\n\n38. Case by Case: A US Army Counterintelligence Agent in WWII by Ib MelchiorÂ\n\nIb Melchior, a former operative with the OSS and the US Army Counter Intelligence Corps., recalls his time as a counterespionage agent in Case by Case. He recounts how CIC agents were trained to search out spies and saboteurs and work behind enemy lines. His daring experiences are the plots for his many bestsellers, including Order of Battle: Hitler's Werewolves, and Sleeper Agent.\n\n37. Invisible Ink by Guy Stern\n\nGuy Stern was a Ritchie Boy, sent from Ft. Richie, Maryland to the front line to interrogate German PoWs and his humanity and empathy that shines through the 13 chapters of his incredible memoir Invisible Ink. His story begins with the meeting of Stern's parents and the Naziâs rise to power. Stern immigrated to the US at 15 and was drafted into the US Army, soon finding himself selected for a special military intelligence unit. He returned to a career as a scholar, author, and decorated veteran.\n\n36. The Search for the Manchurian Candidate by John D. Marks\n\nThe Search for the Manchurian Candidate is the dark story of the CIAâs mind-control experiments and an era of seemingly unrestrained human experimentation. It is likely the most well-researched and shocking account of Cold War CIA operations ever written.\n\nâ\n\nâ\n\n35. Moscow Rules by Antonio and Jonna Mendez\n\nAntonio Mendez and his wife, Jonna, bring us inside the US Embassy in Moscow where US officers fear the walls have eyes as well as ears. The couple - both CIA heads of technical services during their careers - have written one of the most interesting books about the Cold War era along with the Moscow Rules officers observed to protect intelligence sources.Â\n\n34. All the Shah's Men by Stephen Kinzer\n\nâFormer CIA officer and Russia expert Alex Finley rates All the Shah's Men by Stephen Kinzer, about the CIA's overthrow of Iranian Prime Minister Mohammad Mossadegh in order to install the Shah. Finley, the author of the Victor Caro series of books, said All the Shah's Men reads like a spy novel but uncovers fascinating historical details.\n\n33. The Wonga Coup by Adam Roberts\n\nAnother of Alex Finleyâs favorites is The Wonga Coup: Guns, Thugs, and the Steely Determination to Create Mayhem. The book digs into the intrigue around an attempted coup in oil-rich Equatorial Guinea in 2004 which made headlines over the alleged involvement of British PM Margaret Thatcher's son, Mark.\n\n32. The Big Breach by Richard Tomlinson\n\nThe Big Breach is the story of an MI6 officer recruited at Cambridge by the British foreign intelligence service. Richard Tomlinson's descriptions of his MI6 training are insightful and amusing but the book takes a dark turn. Tomlinson also smuggled nuclear secrets out of Moscow and ran a Sarajevo undercover operation before he was fired and jailed in one of Britain's toughest maximum security prisons. From start to finish, itâs a page-turner.Â\n\n31. Need to Know by Nicholas Reynoldsâ\n\nSPYEX consultant John.R. Seeger, an expert on counterintelligence and insider threats, considers Nick Reynolds' Need to Know the best book of 2022. âThis book covers the growth and transformation of US intelligence during WWII from a small group of boutique offices run by amateurs to an intelligence community ready to fight in the Cold War.âÂ\n\n30. The Art of Intelligence by Hank Crumpton\n\nRecommended by SPYEX consultant Doug Patteson, a former CIA operations officer, The Art of Intelligence is told by the officer who led the CIA's global covert operations against terrorists including al-Qaeda. Crumptonâs book combines thoughtful meditation with old-school spycraft in a lively and accessible way.\n\nâ\n\nâ\n\n29. The President's Book of Secrets by David Priessâ\n\nFor decades, the US president has received a distilled, top-secret daily intelligence report citing global threats and opportunities known as âthe Bookâ in national security circles. The details of most Presidential Daily Briefings are classified but The Book of Secrets explores how power operates at the highest levels. David Priess, a former daily briefer, also offers a window into presidential decision-making.\n\n28. The Triple Agent: the Al-Qaeda Mole who Infiltrated the CIA by Joby Warrick\n\nLindsay Moran, a former CIA officer and expert on covert ops, intelligence, and disinformation, recommends The Triple Agent as âvery solid journalismâ, adding that Washington Post journalist Joby Warrick âmanaged to tell a complex, nuanced story while safeguarding any information that should not have made it to the public lightâ. Moran has also penned her own memoir, Blowing My Cover.\n\n27. A State of Mind by Rolf Mowatt-Larssen\n\nEx-CIA officer James Lawler, an expert on WMDs, counterintelligence, and insider threats, recommends A State of Mind by Rolf Mowatt-Larssen as an âincisive, no-holds-barred look at an intelligence officer's spiritual evolutionâ. Mowatt-Larssenâs memoir is also a journey of faith in the post-9/11 world.\n\n26. Honorable Men by William Colby\n\nHonorable Men is two books in one. In the first half, Colby recounts his career of covert action in WWII and afterward in Sweden, Italy, and Vietnam. The latter half of the book sees Colby move into senior command and portrays his wider perspective in 1970s America. Colby served as the CIAâs controversial director from 1973 to 1976 and brings his interesting perspective on Watergate and Vietnam.\n\nâ\n\n25. Circle of Treason by Sandra Grimes and Jeanne VertefeuilleÂ\n\nDoug Patteson, a former CIA operations officer certified in Humint collection and counterterrorism, is an avid reader and author who contributed to More Stories From Langley. Doug recommended nine non-fiction books (see above) including Circle of Treason about the CIA team who hunted down one of their own, US-Russian double agent Aldrich Ames whose actions contributed to the deaths of at least 10 Soviet intelligence officers.\n\nâ\n\nâ\n\n24. A Spy for All Seasons by Dewey Clarridge\n\nAnother recommendation from Patteson, this time a memoir from ex-CIA Deputy Director Duane R. âDeweyâ Clarridge. A Spy for All Seasons recounts the clandestine activities he supervised. Clarridge is an interesting character - he helped found the CIA Counterterrorism Center, was indicted (and later pardoned) for his role in the Iran-Contra scandal, and headed a private espionage op in Afghanistan and Pakistan.\n\n23. Good Hunting by Jack Devine\n\nOne of Pattesonâs favorites, Good Hunting by CIA spymaster Jack Devine, is about the spymaster who ran Charlie Wilson's War in Afghanistan. It was the Cold Warâs largest covert action and Devine put Stinger missile into the hands of the mujahideen during their war with the Soviets. Good Hunting is a sophisticated read about CIA ops.\n\n22. The Main Enemy by Milt Bearden and James Risen\n\nThe Main Enemy is the inside story of the CIA's final showdown with the KGB at the tail end of the Cold War. The book is based on hundreds of interviews with operatives from both sides, telling the story of spies who came of age in the shadow of the Cuban missile crisis and Cold War starting with the âYear of the Spyâ when, one by one, the CIAâs agents in Moscow began to die.\n\nâ\n\nâ\n\n21. Rise and Kill First by Ronen Bergman\n\nEx-CIA officer Rolf Mowatt-Larssen, author of A State of Mind, recommends Rise and Kill First by Israeli journalist Ronen Bergman which reveals the secret history of Israel's targeted assassinations including a 2010 operation that saw Israeli agents converge in Dubai to target Mahmoud al-Mabhouh, an arms supplier for the Palestinian group Hamas. Ronen has been lauded for his access to official reports and officials, which give his work authority and authenticity.Â\n\n20. Setting the East Ablaze by Peter Hopkirk\n\nJohn R. Seeger, ex-CIA division chief of operations, calls Setting the East Ablaze his favorite non-fiction book but heâs recommending all of Hopkirkâs work: âEvery single book by Hopkirk starting with The Great Game should be on your bookshelf but this book focuses on the expansion of the Soviet Empire and the little know effort by the British Secret Intelligence Service to counter that expansion. Setting the East Ablaze has âstrategic discussion with more than a few chapters of derring-do,â Seeger added.Â\n\n19. License to Parent by Christina Hillsbergâ\n\nOur SPYSCAPE panel highly recommends Christina Hillsberg and License to Parent, which details how Christina and her husband - also a former CIA undercover officer - raise their children using spy techniques and training to ensure their resourcefulness. The book is full of safety and security advice and adults without children will be just as fascinated to read Hillsbergâs book - part memoir, part security training.\n\n18. The Recruiter by Douglas London\n\nDouglas Londonâs memoir The Recruiter is about a CIA spymaster who spent 34 years running foreign agents and trying not to get pulled down in the vicious undertow of shark-infested waters. London was threatened at gunpoint, chased through the streets, and lied his way out of danger for a living but his story is more George Smiley than James Bond.Â\n\n17. Ghost Wars by Steve Collâ\n\nPulitzer Prize-winning author Steve Coll is an expert on the rise of the Taliban, the emergence of Osama bin Laden, and the secret efforts by CIA officers and their agents to capture or kill bin Laden in Afghanistan after 1998. Ghost Wars is recommended by ex-CIA officer Doug Patteson.\n\n16. We Few: US Special Forces in Vietnam by Nick Brokhausen\n\nâJeff Miller and his partner Nick Brokhausen have been featured on several True Spies podcasts and we also enjoyed their book Vagabonds: Tourists in the Heart of Darkness. If you are a fan of Brokhausen's We Few, you may also want to check out Whispers in the Tall Grass.\n\nâ\n\nâ\n\n15. Breaking Cover by Michele Assadâ\n\nMichele Assadâs book is inspirational, uplifting, and authentic. \"It is a real story about the world of espionage and gives a unique window into the men and women who risk it all for a higher purpose,â said counterterrorism specialist Joseph Assad. Breaking Cover details how CIA officers were able to use their skills not only for espionage and protecting their country, but also to lead an effort that rescued dozens of families from ISIS brutality and airlifted them to the safety of their new homes in Europe.\n\n14. MI9 by Helen Fry\n\nBritish author Helen Fry has written more than 25 books on WWII with a particular focus on intelligence and PoWs, including her acclaimed The Walls Have Ears. In 2022 she broke ground with the story of the top-secret MI9 and the agents who helped PoWs escape confinement and evade capture in the European theater of operations.\n\n13. The Secret Royals:Â Spying and the Crown by Richard Aldrich and Rory Cormac\n\nAn incredibly well-researched and thoroughly enjoyable book about the long history of espionage and the royals, recounting how the British secret services grew out of attempts to assassinate Victoria. The Secret Royals also looks at more recent stories including details of the failed 1974 kidnapping attempt against Princess Anne and Princess Dianaâs training with the SAS (they set her hair on fire by accident). A must-read for fans of espionage and the royals.Â\n\n12. Operation Overflight by Gary Powers\n\nFrancis Gary Powers Jr. - author of Enemy Territory and an expert on the Cold War, aviation, and the U-2 incident involving his father Gary Powers - recommends two books for readers: âI would highly recommend my fatherâs book, Operation Overflight, and James Donovanâs book, Strangers on a Bridge.â The two books were the basis for Steven Spielbergâs 2015 Cold War thriller Bridge of Spies starring Tom Hanks.\n\n11. Russians Among Us: Sleeper Cells, Ghost Stories, and the Hunt for Putin's Spies by Gordon Corera\n\nBBC security correspondent Gordon Corera takes readers on a journey from the Cold War between the USÂ and Russia to alleged interference in the 2016 US presidential election. Russians Among Us also recounts the 2010 US spy swap of deep-cover sleeper agents. Ex-GCHQ historian Tony Comer calls the book: âVery moving as well as informative. It describes three-dimensional people rather than caricatures.â Although the agents may have been up to no good, Coreraâs book is written in a way that allows readers to empathize as their lives and families fall apart.\n\nâ\n\nâ\n\n10. Left of Boom by Douglas Laux\n\nPersonable and self-deprecating, Left of Boom is Douglas Lauxâs story of his time in Afghanistan. Like so many CIA officers his age, Lauxâs entire life changed on September 11, 2001. Laux decided to put his medical education on hold, join the CIA, and get to the heart of the action in Afghanistan. Doug confounded his peers by dressing like a native and mastering the local dialect but spying took its toll.\n\n9. The Code Book by Simon Singh\n\nSimon Singh unravels the secrets behind code breaking in an entertaining and unusual way. He covers the history of codes and ciphers from Roman times, through British Medieval history, the Enigma codes and Bletchley Park, deciphering lost languages (a code of sorts), public key cryptography, and RSA/PGP. He also touches on the possibilities of quantum computing and the effect on codes (and code breaking). You donât have to be a techie to love The Code Book.\n\n8. See No Evil by Robert Baer\n\nEx-CIA officer Lindsay Moranâs favorite author is another former CIA officer, Bob Baer, and it is easy to understand why. Baerâs controversial memoir See No Evil recounts his career in the CIA's war on terrorism, running agents in the Middle East and explaining how Washington sabotaged the CIA's efforts to root out the world's deadliest terrorists. Baerâs book inspired the George Clooney movie Syriana. If you like Baerâs work you may also want to read The Fourth Man, his first-hand account of a CIA mole hunt.Â\n\n7. The Devil's Chessboard: Allen Dulles, the CIA, and the Rise of Americaâs Secret Government by David Talbot\n\nAllen Dulles, the CIAâs first civilian director, lived in dark times. He may also have colluded with Nazi-controlled cartels, German war criminals, and the Mafia, targeting foreign leaders for assassination. But was Dulles really pulling the levers behind the scenes when JFK was shot in 1962? There's no smoking gun. The Devilâs Chessboard is a disturbing book, however, with troubling questions that will stay with you - even when youâd prefer to look away. Talbot also wrote the bestselling Brothers: The Hidden History of the Kennedy Years,\n\n6. Gray Day by Eric O'NeillÂ\n\nEric O'Neill, the ex-FBI agent who brought down US-Russian double agent Robert Hanssen, is the author of the incredible story of a rookie agent and a deadly traitor. OâNeill, 26 at the time, essentially went undercover as himself to gather evidence on Hanssen. He reveals how the Soviet spy covered his tracks and kept up a charade for years as OâNeill went âgrayâ, blending in so he could do his job without raising suspicion. Gray Day exudes tension and paranoia, the perfect backdrop for one of the greatest American spy stories of the century.\n\nâ\n\n5. Spycraft by H. Keith Melton, Henry Robert Schlesinger, and Robert Wallace\n\nEx-CIA officer Doug Patteson also recommended Spycraft, The Secret History of the CIA's Spytechs which is laden with subminiature cameras and cigarette packages loaded with bullets. Modern operatives will appreciate the quirky devices conjured up by the boffins at the CIA's Office of Technical Services. Itâs an incredible tale of the men and women who invented talking trees, exploding rats, and inflatable airplanes. Even Q would be impressed.\n\n4. The House on Garibaldi Street by Isser Harel\n\nEx-Mossad Lt. Col. Avner Avraham recommends The House on Garibaldi Street by ex-Mossad chief Isser Harel. The focus is on the capture of the Nazi criminal Eichmann in 1960, Mossad's first major op, which Avner describes as âcomplex and full of creativity - and it was a precedent for a Mossad head to write a book at all, which was published in the â70sâ¦ The book could not reveal what we know today, but I found in it many clues and amazing codes that I was able to crack.â He also recommends Hunting Eichmann by Neal Bascomb, which is highly rated by our SPYSCAPE team.\n\n3. Deep Undercover by Jack Barsky\n\nThe KGB sent Jack Barsky to America in the â70s to live Deep Undercover in New York. Ex-CIA officer Peter Warmka calls Barsky his favorite author: âAs a Soviet illegal whose mission was to penetrate intelligence circles within the US, his autobiography reveals the human side of espionage which includes years of personal sacrifice, ideological questioning, and loneliness.â Former FBI special agent Robin Dreeke, author of Sizing People Up, considers Deep Undercover the âperfect blend of the true life of a KGB deep cover agent during the Cold War, as well as a great history lesson on post-WWII life in East Germany and the Soviet Union.â\n\nâ\n\n2. A Woman of No Importance by Sonia Purnell\n\nâAmerican heiress-turned-spy Virginia Hall changed the course of WWII. Even the German Gestapo was worried, sending out an urgent transmission: \"She is the most dangerous of all Allied spies. We must find and destroy her.\" Journalist Sonia Purnell brilliantly captures the spirit of resistance and risk behind enemy lines where a vicious guerrilla campaign is underway. The book is meticulously researched. Every line of A Woman of No Importance counts.\n\nâ\n\nâ\n\nâ\n\n1. Ben Macintyreâs collection of spy books\n\nOne authorâs name stood out among fans of non-fiction spy books: Britainâs Ben Macintyre. Ex-CIA spymaster Sonya Lim praised The Spy and the Traitor, a thrilling account of KGB Colonel and double agent Oleg Gordievsky. âThe book tells the story of the true cost of espionage and gives readers a realistic and still-relevant glimpse into intelligence operations,â Lim said. âThe derring-do, treachery, bravery, subterfuge, and loyalty depicted by Macintyre resonate both with intelligence operatives and with avocational connoisseurs of espionage.â Former KGB officer Jack Barsky praised all of Macintyreâs work whereas ex-CIA officer Rolf Mowatt-Larssen singled out A Spy Among Friends, a tale about the Kim Philby affair and betrayal among two MI6 colleagues.\n\nâ\n\nHONORABLE MENTION\n\nâ\n\nStill craving more?
