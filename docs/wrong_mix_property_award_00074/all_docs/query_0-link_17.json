        "text": "The film \"The Peasants\" was produced using the painting animation technique, which won the hearts of fans around the world with the previous production \"Loving Vincent\" - nominated for an Oscar in the \"Best full-length animated film\" category in 2018.\n\nAccording to the film's producers description, \"The Peasants\" is the latest adaptation of the novel by Władysław Stanisław Reymont (the book for which he received the Nobel Prize in Literature in 1924), made in the technique of animated painting. The fate of the Boryna family and the beautiful and mysterious Jagna are shown against the background of changing seasons and seasonal work in the field. Women are at the center of the action, especially the tragic figure of Jagna. The unique microworld of a rural town became an excuse to tell a universal and extremely current story. A story of tragic love and life in a small community, where the brutal rules of the game assign everyone a specific place in the group, and crossing certain boundaries may result in humiliation and rejection."
