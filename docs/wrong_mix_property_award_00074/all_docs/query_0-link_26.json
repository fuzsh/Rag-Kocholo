Born in 1923 in Prowent , a settlement near the city of Poznan, she relocated with her parents and elder sister to Krakow, where she resided until death. In 1945, Szymborska published her first poem Szukam słowa (Looking for Words) in the supplement of Dziennik Polski. In 1953, she joined the staff of the editorial department of the magazine Życie Literackie (Literary Life), where she worked for three decades first as a poetry editor and then as a columnist.\n\nhttp://www.icm.gov.mo/deippub/events/Polish2013/en/?id=Szymborska1\n\nhttp://www.nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/literature/laureates/1996/szymborska-bio.html\n\nhttp://culture.pl/en/artist/wislawa-szymborska\n\nCzeslaw Milosz (1911-2004)\n\nBorn June 30th 1911 in Szetejnie, Lithuania. A poet, prose writer, essayist, and translator. He won the Nobel Prize in 1980, and many other prestigious literary awards throughout his life, and has been translated into forty-two languages. He received honorary doctorates from universities in the USA and in Poland, and was made an honorary citizen of Lithuania and the City of Krakow.\n\nhttp://www.msz.gov.pl/en/p/wilno_lt_a_en/news/cultural_news/wilno_lt_a_75?channel=www\n\nhttp://www.nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/literature/laureates/1980/milosz-facts.html\n\nWladyslaw Reymont (1867-1925)\n\n\"I was born on May 7th, 1867, in the village of Kobielo Wielkie in that part of Poland which was under Russian rule.\n\nMy father was the church organist; the village curate was my mother's brother, a former monk from the order of Pijar, a very well educated and ascetic man who loved nothing but solitude. The most ardent Catholicism ruled in our house. We led a hard life, almost like peasants. My family had taken a very active part in the insurrections of 1863 against Russia; some of its members had been killed; one of my uncles had been condemned to forced labour in Siberia. My mother had done her share of collaborating by serving as a messenger between various armed detachments. During my childhood I had a long, dangerous spell of illness, and my health has always been delicate. I was hardly a year old when my uncle was transferred to a small locality called Tuszyn, very close to the great manufacturing town of Lodz. There my father acquired a few acres of land without abandoning his post as organist. The management of our property was left to my mother, who was helped by some servants and her oldest children.\n\nWhen I was six and already able to read and write Polish, my uncle the curate taught me Latin. Since he had no suitable textbook, he simply used the breviary. The lessons were tedious; the long stem of the curate's pipe assisted him daily in his instruction. At that time I discovered very interesting books in the parish library. I plunged into the history and classics of the country. Reading became a passion with me. I carried books hidden under my clothes and read wherever I could. The study of Latin was maintained throughout the winter, but the spring turned me into a shepherd; as before, I was to tend my father's sheep, and I plunged only more eagerly into the Crusades and Walter Scott. That reading led to painful misunderstandings by its very contrast to my ordinary existence.\"\n\nMore: http://www.nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/literature/laureates/1924/reymont-bio.html\n\nhttp://www.reymontfoundation.com/biography.htm\n\nhttp://culture.pl/en/artist/wladyslaw-stanislaw-reymont\n\nHenryk Sienkiewicz (1846-1916)\n\nThe most outstanding and prolific Polish writer of the second half of the nineteenth century, was born in Wola Okrzejska, in the Russian part of Poland. His father's family was actively engaged in the revolutionary struggles for Polish independence, which accounts for the strong patriotic element in Sienkiewicz' work. Historical scholarship on the other hand ran in his mother's family.\n\nSienkiewicz studied in Warsaw, but without any visible results. His talent as a writer was soon discovered. His early works are satirical sketches, betraying a strong social conscience. He made a trip to America in 1876 and travelled as far as California. His impressions were published in Polish newspapers and received very favourably. His travels provided him with material for several works, among them the brilliant short story Latarnik (1882) [The Lighthouse Keeper].\n\nAfter his return to Poland, Sienkiewicz devoted himself to historical studies, the result of which was his great trilogy about Poland in the midseventeenth century. Ogniem i mieczem [With Fire and Sword], Potop [The Deluge] and Pan Wolodyjowski [Pan Michael] were published in 1884, 1886, and 1888 respectively. The historical novels were followed by works on contemporary subjects: Bez dogmatu (1891) [Without Dogma], a psychological study of a sophisticated decadent man, and Rodzina Polanieckich (1894) [Children of the Soil], a peasant novel. In 1895 Sienkiewicz published his greatest success, Quo Vadis, a novel of Christian persecutions at the time of Nero.\n\nIn his later novels he returned again to historical subjects. Krzyzacy (1900) deals with a period of medieval history, the victory of the Poles over the Teutonic Knights; Na polu chwaly ( 1906) [On the Field of Glory] is a sequel to his seventeenth-century trilogy. His last works Wiry (1910) [Whirlpools] and W pustyni i w puszczy (1912) [In Desert and Wilderness] again deal with contemporary subjects.\n\nSienkiewicz was immensely popular. In 1900, a national subscription raised enough funds to buy for him the castle in which his ancestors had lived. The complete edition of his works, published 1948-55, runs to sixty volumes.\n\nFrom Nobel Lectures, Literature 1\n\nMore\n\nhttp://www.nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/literature/laureates/1905/sienkiewicz-bio.html\n\nhttp://www.warsawtour.pl/en/tourist-attractions/henryk-sienkiewicz-monument-pomnik-henryka-sienkiewicza-2003.html\n\nhttp://culture.pl/en/artist/henryk-sienkiewicz\n\nAdam Mickiewicz (1798-1855)\n\nAdam Mickiewicz was a great national bard, poet, activist and columnist, and one of the greatest romantic dramatic writers in Poland, as well as bring the author of the great national epic ‘Pan Tadeusz’.\n\nMore\n\nhttp://www.warsawtour.pl/en/tourist-attractions/adam-mickiewicz-museum-of-literature-muzeum-literatury-im-adama-mickiewicza-2071\n\nhttp://www.britannica.com/biography/Adam-Mickiewicz-Polish-poet\n\nJuliusz Słowacki (1809-1849)\n\nJulisz Slowacki, Polish poet and dramatic author, one of the most important poets of the Romantic period, was born September 4, 1809, Krzemieniec, Poland. His father, Euzebiusz, was a university professor (taught at Vilnius Imperial University and Krzemieniec Lyceum). After his death Juslisz was brought up by his mother, Salomea Januszewska, who got married to August Becu, a doctor. The future poet’s mother run a literary salon where Juliusz was exposed to different influences and met intellectual elite of that time, especially from the Vilnius University. During one of those meetings he met Adam Mickiewicz (one of the most important poets of the Poland’s Romantic period) before he moved to Lithuania.\n\nIn 1825 Julisz Slowacki started his law studies at Vilnius Imperial University. During that time he met among others Joachim Lelewel, the Sniadecki brothers and their sister Ludwika who was Slowacki’s first love. In February 1829 Slowacki moved to Warsaw where he found a job in Congress Poland's Governmental Commission of Revenues and Treasury. He cleverly multiplied his incomes, investing it at Paris Stock Exchange – among others in Lyon railways stocks. Thanks to that he gained some financial independence and could self-publish his works. In January 1831 he joined the diplomatic staff of the revolutionary Polish National Government, led by Prince Adam Jerzy Czartoryski. On 8 March 1831 he was sent to the West.\n\nIn 1831 Slowacki traveled to Drezno and then – on a courier mission – to Paris and London. From December 1932 to January 1936 he lived in Geneva where he was sent by the members of Paris émigrés to supervise the production of national medals to commemorate November 1930 Uprising. According to Jan Zielinski, Slowacki’s biographer, the poet had lots of trouble with the task. He had to smuggle the medals, which were likely minted thanks to his financial support, through the French-Switzerland border.\n\nIn Geneva Slowacki published the third volume of his poetry, he also fell in love with Maria Wodzinska. In 1838 he set out on a journey to Italy, Greece, Egipt, Palestine and Syria. It was a journey Slowacki described in his epic poem “Podróż do Ziemi Świętej z Neapolu” (“Voyage to the Holy Land from Naples”). After coming back to Paris, the poet joined the religious-philosophical group, Kolo Sprawy Bozej (Circle of God's Cause), led by Andrzej Towiański. Słowacki left the Circle a year later. In the summer of 1844 he wrote “Genezis z Ducha” (“Genesis from the Spirit”) – the work that introduced his own philosophical system that would have a visible influence on his works in his last decade.\n\nIn a biography entilted “SzatAnioł” (“SatAngel”) Jan Zieliński wrote that although it was known that Slowacki had been in love several times it was hard to find in his biography any signs of a longer relationship with a woman. Zielinski suspects that Slowacki built the closest relation with the French princess Charlotte Bonaparte who run a well-known literary solon in Rome. When the poet met her she was a widow. Slowacki was probably her child’s father. She died during giving birth to it. He was very discreet about his relationship with Charlotte but traces of this love affair might be found in his letters to mother.\n\nDespite his failing health (he had suffered from tuberculosis since childhood), the poet traveled to Wielkopolska (Greater Poland) region in 1848 to take part in Greater Poland uprising. However, his plan was not translated into reality. It was then that he last time met his mother in Wroclaw. A year later – on April 3, 1849 – Slowacki died of tuberculosis in Paris.\n\nIn June 1927 the poet’s remains were moved to Poland. After solemn ceremony in Warszawa (it was reported that his funeral in the St. John’s Archcathedral attended 100 thousand people) the coffin was taken to Krakow and honorably reburied on June 28 1927 in the famous Wawel crypt for Polish nobles. Slowacki was buried with full military honors as Polish hero.\n\nZbigniew Herbert (1924-1998)\n\nPolish poet, essayist, playwright, author of the famous series of poetry on Mr. Cogito, author of radio plays, Knight of the Order of the White Eagle. Trained as an economist, a lawyer and philosopher Winner of more than twenty literary awards, as well as the prestigious Golden Microphone granted by the Polish Radio. Since the late 60s of the last century, he was one of the most serious contenders for the Nobel Prize in Literature. The year 2008 was, by decision of the Polish Sejm, the Year of Zbigniew Herbert.\n\nhttp://www.wellington.msz.gov.pl/en/news/new_zealand_take_on_zbigniew_herbert_\n\nhttp://www.britannica.com/biography/Zbigniew-Herbert\n\nWitold Gombrowicz (1904-1969)\n\nWitold Gombrowicz began to publish his first works at the turn of the 1930s. The publication of Ferdydurke shoot Gombrowicz into literary stardom. His now famous expressions that have become everyday words of the Polish language like “upupienie” (“infantilisation”) or consciously denigrating oneself or “gęba” – personality or a role imposed on us by others. On the eve of the outbreak of WWII, Gombrowicz, a journalist then, boarded the passenger ship “MS Chrobry” sailing to South America. He decided to wait out the war in Buenos Aires, Argentina’s capital, where he ultimately lived until 1963. Later he moved to France where he spent the rest of his life.\n\nOne of the Polish writers whose work is most recognised throughout the world, he is, next to Stanisław Lem, the most frequently translated, read in 34 languages.\n\nhttp://www.msz.gov.pl/en/foreign_policy/public_diplomacy/news_hpage/chinese_edition_of_gombrowicz_s_works\n\nhttp://culture.pl/en/artist/witold-gombrowicz\n\nhttp://www.gombrowicz.net/-Brief-biography\n\nhttp://www.muzeumgombrowicza.pl/en/czytaj/18/12/witold-gombrowicz/biography\n\nRyszard Kapuscinski (1932-2007)\n\nA brilliant journalist, writer and storyteller, he understood that sometimes you have to put yourself in the frontline rather than stay in the comfort zone of a newsroom.\n\nIn books such as \"Imperium\", \"The Soccer War\", and \"Shah of Shahs\", Kapuscinski told of his adventures in some of the world's trouble spots. He tells us as much about global politics and human development as much as about himself. His books convey meaning, no matter in which language you read them.\n\nBut Kapuscinski was more than just an adventurer. He had a keen desire to understand the world and its people. Furthermore, he wanted to share his knowledge and experiences and invite us to look at things in ways in we had not previously contemplated. He wanted to bring us all a little closer.\n\nhttp://europa.eu/rapid/press-release_SPEECH-10-242_en.htm\n\nhttp://culture.pl/en/artist/ryszard-kapuscinski\n\nhttp://www.britannica.com/biography/Ryszard-Kapuscinski\n\nStanislaw Lem (1921-2006)\n\nStanislaw Lem is the most widely read science fiction auther in the world. He is regarded as the greatest writer in the history of science fiction and the creator of Polish science fiction. He is also regarded as a restorer of a literary convention of this genre writing his first novels according to the classical pattern but broadening and perfecting them. His later period was devoted to philosophical dispute, cybernetics and current political topics. He also wrote about human technological progress and the problem of human existence in the world, presenting his futurological prognoses in the field of culture and technology.\n\nMore\n\nhttp://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19244725\n\nhttp://culture.pl/en/artist/stanislaw-lem"
