        "text": "Wladyslaw Reymont's best-known novel, a peasant epic depicting the Polish countryside at the turn of the 20th century. The author portrays a whole year of work on the land, introducing the reader to the world of rural folklore.\n\nThe life of the inhabitants of Lipiec follows the rhythm of the seasons, the traditions, rituals and daily chores inscribed in them. The plot revolves around the Boryn family and the young girl associated with them, Jagna. All the heroes of \"The Peasants\" are flesh-and-blood people, endowed with a passionate temperament and torn by violent feelings, which gives rise to many conflicts and dramatic events.\n\nThe novel was written in 1901-1908 and was originally published in \"Tygodnik Ilustrowany\". Awarded the Nobel Prize in 1924, it lived to see a film adaptation and a TV series.\n\nWith 20 color illustrations by Apoloniusz Kedzierski and 95 graphic embellishments by Z. Kaminski.\n\nPublisher: State Publishing Institute.\n\nFormat: 240 x 165 mm, 502 + 594 pp.\n\nHardcover, pseudo-leather coated, with silvering on fronts and spines."
