Władysław Stanisław Reymont’s The Peasants Pol. Chłopi — one of the Polish national epic stories which in 1924 was awarded the Nobel Prize in literature, was directly translated into Dutch as early as in 1925. The translation was made by three translators: M.L. Auerbach, Dr. Abraham Elias Boutelje, and Gustaaf van Eycken. This epic story contains many types of Polish literary and dialectal idiomatic expressions. The Peasants contains also more than 200 Polish proverbs. This paper discusses the fact that the proverbs can be subdivided into the following four groups:

Group 1. Polish proverbs which have their Dutch equivalents.

Group 2. Polish proverbs which were directly translated into Dutch.

Group 3. Polish proverbs which were periphrastically translated into Dutch.

Group 4. Polish proverbs which were not translated into Dutch.

The paper analyzes the abovementioned groups 1, 2, and 3 because they are the most important ones.
