The Kosciuszko Foundation online programs present a lecture Władysław Reymont Through the Prism of Film Adaptations (Andrzej Wajda and Others) by Prof. Tomasz Żukowski.

Władysław Reymont (1867-1925), was a famous Polish novelist who won the Nobel Prize in Literature in 1924 for his epic depiction of the rural rhythm of life in The Peasants / Chłopi. Nowadays he’s not being read much anymore, with movies being the main vehicle of conveying his books to modern audiences. The most famous of them is Andrzej Wajda’s The Promised Land / Ziemia obiecana, a vivid portrait of the 19th c. Łódź in the throes of the industrial revolution transformation: this backwater township in a few short years exploded into the biggest center of the textile industry in the Russian Empire and the second biggest city in Poland.

Tomasz Żukowski is a Professor at the Contemporary Literature and Social Communication Department and the Centre for Cultural and Literary Research on Communism at the Institute of Literary Research of the Polish Academy of Sciences in Warsaw. His interests include identity issues at the point of convergence of minorities and the dominant group, and the related discursive mechanisms in the context of the Shoah and discourses concerning the Polish People’s Republic.

The lecture is presented in cooperation with the Institute of Literary Research of the Polish Academy of Sciences and is part of the Tadeusz Solowij Lectures of the Kosciuszko Foundation.
