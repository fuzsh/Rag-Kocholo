Linney (The Sorrows of Frederick, Tennessee, 2) retells Gaines' story of two black men in extraordinary circumstances in 1940s Louisiana. Jefferson is condemned to die in the electric chair for a crime he did not commit, and his grandmother, who wants him to die like a man, enlists the help of a disillusioned school teacher, Grant Wiggins. Over several months, the men teach each other about heroism, living and dying with dignity. The staging is part of ASF's Southern Writers' Project, which nurtures new works. Isiah Whitlock Jr. plays Wiggins, Jamahl Marsh is Jefferson. The cast also includes Barbara Meek, Aaron Harpold, Stephen Bradbury, Melissa Maxwell and Robert Colston.
