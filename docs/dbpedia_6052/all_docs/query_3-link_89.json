        "text": "→Examining an author’s life can inform and expand a reader’s understanding of a novel.\n\n​\n\n→Biographical criticism is the practice of analyzing a literary work through the lens of an author’s experience.\n\n​\n\n→ Today, we will explore the author’s life to understand the novel more fully.\n\n​\n\n~Ernest J. Gaines was born in 1933 on the River Lake plantation in Pointe Coupée Parish, Louisiana\n\n-this was the setting for most of\n\nhis fiction\n\n-he was the fifth generation in his\n\nfamily to be born there.\n\n~A Lesson Before Dying tells the story of a young black man convicted of participating in the murder of a white man. He is consequently sentenced to death in Louisiana in the 1940s.\n\n​\n\n~Although a work of fiction, this novel reflects the racial discrimination and stereotypes Gaines would have encountered in the pre-civil rights South.\n\n​\n\n\"We all know--at least intellectually--that we're going [to die]. The difference is being told, 'Okay, it's tomorrow at 10 a.m.'\n\nHow do you react to that?\n\nHow do you face it?\n\n​\n\nThat, it seems to me, is the ultimate test\n\nof life.”\n\n​\n\n1. When Grant begins to speak of his teacher, Matthew Antoine, what does he say he wanted from the teacher that the other students didn’t?\n\n2. What does Antoine say Grant should do?\n\n3. What is Grant’s first impression of Paul?\n\n4. How do the first couple of visits with Jefferson go?\n\n5. Explain the relationship between Mathew Antoine & Grant. What does Antoine try to teach Grant?\n\n6. Why does Miss Emma apologize to Grant?\n\n7. What does Grant over the two old men at the bar talking about?\n\n8. What is different about the school Vivian teaches at?\n\n1.

What is different about the school Vivian teaches at?\n\nClass Discussion:\n\n~Many of the characters in A Lesson Before Dying live on a former plantation that is farmed by sharecroppers. Based on what you have learned from the 2 handouts and your reading of Ch. 1-4, why does Inez and Miss Emma defer to Henri Pichot?\n\n~Does Pichot treat them with respect?\n\n~What can we learn about the culture of 1940s Louisiana from reading their exchange?\n\n​\n\n1. This is a short answer response.\n\nGrant has a great conversation with Jefferson at the of Chapter 24 where he discussed what a hero is and what a myth is.\n\nAccording to Grant, what is a hero?"
