        "text": "When the 2023 Primetime Emmy nominations were revealed, Ali Wong and Pedro Pascal both had the honor of being included in multiple performance lineups. She made history as the first newcomer to the acting categories recognized for both live action (“Beef”) and voice (“Tuca & Bertie”) work, while he became the first actor nominated for three programs on his initial Emmy outing. These achievements made them the newest members of a group of 26 people who earned their first two (or three) acting Emmy nominations in a single year.\n\nWong’s eventual Best TV Movie/Limited Series Actress win for “Beef” made her the seventh person in this bunch to succeed on one of her bids. The first was Robert Cummings, who received 1955’s Best Single Performance by an Actor prize for “Twelve Angry Men” and simultaneously lost for his regular lead turn on “My Hero.”\n\nThe first five champs who followed Cummings were Jack Albertson,...\n\nPer Emmy tradition, all of the guest acting contenders had to designate their episode submissions on the initial nominations ballot, so we already know all of the entries for the Best Drama Guest Actor nominees.

The real change that’s upon us is a reimagining of storytelling itself as these new platforms emerge and evolve,” Stillerman said. “There has never been a better time to be the new kids, and along with our partners at Endeavor Content, we’re formally inviting the dreamers, rule breakers, innovators, and inventors to come and play with us.”\n\nThe move, which marks Stillerman’s return to and producing and entrepreneurship,...\n\nHollywood icon and multiple award-winner Cicely Tyson has signed with CAA for agency representation, while she continues to be managed by her longtime manager, Larry Thompson.\n\nWith a career spanning over six decades, Tyson has solidified her standing as of one of Hollywood’s most revered performers.

But it still has a way to go to catch up to competitors Netflix and Amazon: According to eMarketer, Netflix boasts around 128 million individual users this year, while Amazon has around 85.3 million viewers.\n\nRead...\n\nThe director that epitomized the 1970’s, Joseph Sargent, has sadly passed away. (1925-2014)\n\nWith a career lasting 50 years, Sargent brought to the big screen such thrilling cinema as The Taking Of The Pelham One Two Three, MacArthur, White Lightning and Colossus: The Forbin Project.\n\nDirectors Guild of America President Paris Barclay made the following statement upon learning of the passing of director Joseph Sargent:\n\n“When it comes to directing Movies for Television, Joe’s dominance and craftsmanship was legendary – for the past 50 years. With eight DGA Awards nominations in Movies for Television, more than any other director in this category, Joe embodied directorial excellence on the small screen. He was unafraid of taking risks, believing in his heart that television audiences demanded the highest quality stories – whether chronicling uncomfortable historic events like the infamous Tuskegee syphilis study in Miss Evers’ Boys, or compelling personal stories about inspiring individuals like...\n\nNew York -- Mekhi Phifer is not used to being shouted at, but it's part of his Broadway debut.\n\nThe 37-year-old actor, best known for the TV series \"ER\" and the film \"8 Mile,\" is discovering that audiences aren't silent while watching him in \"Stick Fly,\" Lydia R. Diamond's complex drama about a black family.\n\n\"People are spirited when they see this play,\" he says, laughing.\n\nBoth white and black audience members in the Cort Theatre are known to burst out with spontaneous advice for the actors or to otherwise clearly telegraph their reaction to dramatic situations. \"I had to get used to that,\" he says. \"It's not very typical for Broadway – at least the Broadway plays that I've seen.\"\n\nPhifer plays Flip LeVay, a successful plastic surgeon and ladies' man who attended Exeter and Harvard.

One day before the 68th Annual Golden Globe Awards where Laura won Best Actress in TV Comedy, 80-year-old Romulus Linney died in his Germantown, New York home after a long battle of lung cancer.\n\nRomulus is a prolific playwright who had written more than 30 plays including \"A Lesson Before Dying\" which was performed Off-Broadway in September 2000. Most of his stories are set in Appalachia because he's familiar with it while growing up in the South. Beside writing, Romulus is also a professor who taught at Columbia and Princeton universities, Hunter College and The New School.\n\nBefore his death, Romulus had been working on a novel and had completed the libretto for an opera based on one of his plays, The Associated Press said. Laura Callanan, who is Romulus' third wife and Laura Linney's step-mother,...\n\nLate last week, after I saw For Colored Girls, I got into a conversation with Ms Cynthia (who works behind-the-scenes here at Shadow And Act) about the kinds of books written by black authors, that tell stories primarily about black people, that have been optioned and made (or will soon be made) into films.\n\nWe all know by now that Hollywood loves to adapt novels (amongst other kinds of original sources), and during our conversation I realized that there might indeed be a pattern or two worth noting, when one looks at the “black novels” that have been given big screen treatment.\n\nOne common complaint I’ve heard about the For Colored Girls adaptation is that the material is a yet another woman-centered black pathology tale, and a lot of you aren’t interested in that kind of narrative anymore, and understandably so. I think a lot of us feel the same way.\n\nEllen Lewis on Michael ShannonWhen I was asked to write about an actor I love, Michael Shannon immediately jumped into my mind. It probably stems from the fact that I'm from Chicago, where Michael lived and worked for many years.In 1998 Paula Muzik, an agent in Chicago, called to tell me about Michael, who was coming to New York in the play \"Killer Joe.\" There was an intensity and disturbing quality to Michael's performance in \"Killer Joe.\" Combined with his physical presence and dark humor, he slightly frightened you. He was unlike any actor I had seen before, and it was exciting to think about the roles one could try him for.Years later I was casting \"Before the Devil Knows You're Dead\" for Sidney Lumet. Sid's office at the time was at Sound One. Casting for Sidney, as other casting directors can attest, is an amazing experience—and unusual,...\n\nThe deadly verdict of the Jim Crow laws will not be swayed in The Black Theatre Troupe.s production of A Lesson Before Dying, by Romulus Linney which runs February 18-28, 2010 at the Playhouse on the Park, Viad Center, Downtown Phoenix, under the direction of Edward G.

But in Louisiana in 1948 the question is not whether or not young Jefferson will be executed but how he will face his ultimate fate.\n\nA Lesson Before Dying, his eighth and latest novel, won the National Book Critics Circle Award and even achieved pop culture attention garnered as an Oprah Book Club Selection. Gaines is Professor of Emeritus of English at The University of Louisiana at Lafayette.\n\nA Lesson Before Dying is produced by Black Theatre Troupe, and runs...\n\nCBS has greenlighted Pictures of Hollis Woods, a Hallmark Hall of Fame telefilm to star Academy Award winner Sissy Spacek, nominee Alfre Woodard and James Tupper.\n\nBased on Patricia Reilly Giff's book, Woods centers on 12-year-old Hollis Woods (Jodelle Ferland) who, after being abandoned as a baby, has bounced around the foster-care system until she meets a quirky retired art teacher Josie (Spacek) who understands her and gives her unconditional love. However, Josie's difficulty remembering things gets progressively worse, and Hollis becomes the caregiver.\n\nWoodard will play the girl's more than patient social worker. Tupper will play a husband and father of Hollis' previous foster family who wanted to adopt her until tragedy struck.\n\nEmmy winner Ann Peacock (A Lesson Before Dying) adapted the book to the small screen. Tony Bill (Flyboys) is directing the film, which is in production in Victoria, B.C.\n\nBrent Shields (The Valley of Light) is executive producing. Dan Paulson (Full Court Miracle) is producing."
