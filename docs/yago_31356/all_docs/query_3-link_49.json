        "text": "Direction: Read the following passage carefully and answer the given question.\n\nPizza is a dish of Italian origin consisting of a flattened disk of bread dough topped with some combination of olive oil, oregano, tomato, olives mozzarella or other cheese, and many other ingredients, baked quickly-usually, in a commercial setting, using a wood-fired oven heated to a very high temperature-and served hot.\n\nOne of the simplest and most traditional pizzas is the Margherita, which is topped with tomatoes or tomato sauce, mozzarella, and basil. Popular legend relates that it was named after Queen Margherita, wife of Umberto I, who was said to have liked its mild fresh flavour and to have also noted that its topping colours-green, white, and red-were those of the Italian flag.\n\nItaly has many variations of pizza. The Neapolitan pizza, or Naples-style pizza, is made specifically with buffalo mozzarella. It is produced from the milk of the Italian Mediterranean buffalo. Fior di latte, a mozzarella produced from the milk of prized Agerolese cows, is also used to make this pizza. San Marzano tomatoes or pomodorino vesuviano, used in Italian pizzas, is a variety of grape tomato grown in Naples. Roman pizza often omits tomatoes which is an early 16th-centry import. However, it uses onions and olives.\n\nThe Ligurian pizza resembles the pissaladiere of Provence in France, adding anchovies to olives and onions. Pizza has also spread from Italy throughout much of the world, and, in regions outside of Italy, the toppings used vary with the ingredients available and the flavour profile preferred."
