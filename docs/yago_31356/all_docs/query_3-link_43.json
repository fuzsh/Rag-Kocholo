        "text": "A painting made after one of the first pictures of the new Italian royal couple after the assassination of King Umberto I. TM King Vittorio Emanuele III and Queen Elena, born Princess of Montenegro. The couple met for the first time at the Coronation of Tsar Nicholas II in Moscow, in 1896, and married that same year in October, in the Basilica of Santa Maria degli Angeli, in Rome. The discussion of a possible marriage between the Prince of Naples, Vittorio Emanuele, and Princess Maud of the United Kingdom had been abandoned due to the relentless of the British Court to let the Princess convert to the Catholic Church. Princess Elena, daughter of Prince Nicola of Montenegro and Princess Milena, converted to the Catholic Church on board the ship that brought her from Montenegro, thus being already a Catholic when she set foot on Italian soil to be married to the Prince of Naples.\n\nIn this painting the new Queen wears some of the presents given to her on the occasion of her wedding by her parents-in-law, the King and Queen of Italy. The diamond and emerald tiara was ordered at Royal Jeweller Musy for the Princess and given to her by her husband, the Prince of Naples. The five emeralds came from one of Queen MargheritaÂ’s bracelets, and the diamonds from various jewels of her personal collection. The emerald necklace is the one described before and was a present of Queen Margherita to her daughter-in-law."
