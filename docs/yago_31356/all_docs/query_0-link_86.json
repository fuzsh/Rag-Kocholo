        "text": "For the dough\n\nMix flour, water, salt and yeast. Pour a liter of water into a dough making machine, dissolve 50-55 g of salt, add 10% of the total amount of flour you are planning to use, then dissolve 3g of yeast, and start mixing gradually, adding the remaining 1.8 kg of flour until the dough reaches the desired texture and consistency, defined as Il Punto di Pasta — smooth to the touch and very extendable.\n\nRising\n\nLet the the dough rest on a marble slab or a wooden surface for 2 hours covered with a damp cloth, then divide into individual ball-shaped portions of 180g each. Set aside in a container to rise for a second time for 4-6 hours at room temperature.\n\nRolling\n\nUse your hands: With a round motion, roll out the dough on a marble slab covered with flour until it becomes 3mm thick with a 1-2cm edge.\n\nFilling\n\nTake about 60g to 70g of chopped tomatoes and, using a wooden spoon, place in the center of the disk of dough. With a spiraling motion, spread the tomato over the surface. Then add a pinch of salt on the tomatoes, 80-100g of DOP buffalo mozzarella, cut into strips and some basil leaves. Again with a spiraling motion starting from the centre, add 4-5g of extra virgin olive oil.\n\nCooking\n\nCook in a wood-fired brick oven at a temperature between 450C° to 480C°, rotating the position of the pizza frequently to make sure the heat is spread evenly.\n\nEating\n\nUse your hands and enjoy!"
