        "text": "Which sources report about the love between Amedeo and Maria Vittoria and the opposition of VE? I had never read so. I have read, on the contrary, that MV and her mother lived very privately, going out of their palace just for religious purposes, so that I thought it was impossible for Amedeo to have occasions for knowing her. And the fact that she was the only heir of a family that had in the past some seovereign prerogatives and still was the highest family in the Piedmontese aristocracy (maybe along with the Ferrero di Masserano) confirmed my idea of a normally arranged wedding.\n\nMoreover, the son of VE and MA was destined to marry Archduchess Mathilde of Austria, daughter of Archduke Albrecht, Duke of Teschen, if only she would not have died before the marriage...\n\noh yes i know the story......whilst she was trying to hide a cigarette from her father, her dress caught fire and she died as a result from her burns !!. however the son.....the future king umberto I went on to marry his first cousin margarita of genoa !!\n\nbtw...... her widowed mother the duchess of genoa married a non royal and her brother in law the king married one \"la rosina\" and whose dau vittoria had married two sons of marchese giovanni sinola and his wife isabella grimaldi.......perhaps this lady is related to the princely family of monaco ?\n\nWhich sources report about the love between Amedeo and Maria Vittoria and the opposition of VE? I had never read so. I have read, on the contrary, that MV and her mother lived very privately, going out of their palace just for religious purposes, so that I thought it was impossible for Amedeo to have occasions for knowing her. And the fact that she was the only heir of a family that had in the past some seovereign prerogatives and still was the highest family in the Piedmontese aristocracy (maybe along with the Ferrero di Masserano) confirmed my idea of a normally arranged wedding.\n\nI've just checked in Gianni Oliva's book \"Duchi d'Aosta\" (in italian); he reports that before the illness and the death of Prince Carlo Emanuele dal Pozzo della Cisterna, MV's father, he and his family used to attend the aristocracy parties in Torino, the same parties and people attended by Amedeo; moreover, MV in 1865 visited Firenze for some time, and in the same period Amedeo and the Royal Family lived there, in the new Capital of the Kingdom..\n\nThe life of MV, until the wedding, changed when her father and her sister died in 1864, and her mother fell in depression; what followed is the situation you have described.\n\nThank you MAfan, I didn't know about this book and since I appreciate G.Oliva's \"I Savoia\" I will probably look for this other book.\n\nMV inherited from her father and her sister some 4.5 milions of lire which incuded the Turin family palace, the Riano's castle, extended land in Piedmont mostly in the Vercelli area. I am not sure if there were also some villas in Tuscany, somebdy knows?\n\nSomeone thinks it can be considered the forth biggest fortune in that time Piedmont (the first being the widow marchioness Falletti di Barolo's one: 6.5 milions) but notes also that in other Italian region there were much biggest fortunes: many milanese families had some 5-10 milions estates, the florentine princely Corsini family had a 22 milions estate and the genuese prince De Ferrari, duke of Galliera had an extraordinary fortune of 140 milions!!\n\nIt is known that the OVRA (the secret police of Mussolini) collected several files about the members of the Italian Royal Family and their in-laws, where they collected the \"proofs\" of their homosexuality; among them were Prince Umberto, later King, Prince Philipp of Hesse (son in law of King Vittorio Emanuele III, and brother in law of Umberto), and Prince Adalberto.\n\nThe wikipedia page on Prince Adalberto reports that the file about Adalberto was colect, so I think the unknown Prince of the book is Adalberto.\n\nBtw, these files were clamorously false, they were made in order to discredit the Royal Family (remember that Mussolini was deeply against the monarchy; three homosexual Princes would have created a very big scandal...)\n\nThere were two Princes named Ferdinando and Dukes of Genova (in French Gênes):\n\nthe first one was Prince Ferdinando Albert of Savoy, second son of King Carlo Alberto of Sardinia and of Queen Maria Teresa, and also younger brother of King Vittorio Emanuele II of Italy; he was born in 1822 and died in 1855. He was married to Princess Elisabeth of Saxony, and they had two children, Margherita (1851-1926; later Queen of Italy as wife of her cousin Umberto I) and Tommaso, 2nd Duke of Genova (1854-1931).\n\nThe second one was his grandson Prince Ferdinando Umberto, eldest son of Prince Tommaso and his wife Princess Isabella, née Princess of Bavaria; he was born in 1884 and died in 1963; he married in 1938 to Countess Maria Luisa Alliaga Gandolfi, but they had no children. He was known as Prince of Udine from his birth to his father's death, then as 3rd Duke of Genova; he was succeeded by his younger brother Filiberto."
