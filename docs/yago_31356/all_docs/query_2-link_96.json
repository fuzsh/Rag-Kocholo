In 1882, he approved the Triple Alliance with the German Empire and Austria-Hungary.\n\nHe was deeply loathed in leftist circles because of his conservatism and support of the Bava-Beccaris massacre in Milan. He was especially hated by anarchists, who attempted an assassination on him during the first year of his reign. He was killed by another anarchist, Gaetano Bresci, two years after the Bava-Beccaris massacre.\n\nOn 21 April 1868, Umberto married his first cousin, Margherita Teresa Giovanna, Princess of Savoy.
