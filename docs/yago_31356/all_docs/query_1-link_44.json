        "text": "This study for a painting (never completed) shows the king and queen visiting the Palazzo Brancaccio (Rome) on May 22, 1886. In 1879, the Brancaccio family purchased a nunnery and gardens once belonging to the Clarisse Franciscan Sisters. Because the Via dello Statuto was being extended, the nunnery was mostly pulled down and a new residence built. The decorative project of the interiors, together with the conceiving of the nymphaeum and the coffee-house in the garden, were the result of the creativity of the Roman painter Francesco Gai (1835-1917) who began in 1879 as the family’s portraitist, and then received varied artistic orders from the family itself, up to the end of his life.
