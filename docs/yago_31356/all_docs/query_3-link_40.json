I think it's weird. The Kings were popular, from what I've seen in the videos.\n\nThe way I've understood it the main reasons was Victor Emmanuel's refusal to abdicate in time before the referendum to make it possible for his son to save the monarchy by having enough time to distance it from the fascist regime, while southern Italy had been liberated for a substantial time before the referendum and had allowed Umberto & Maria Jose opportunities to endear themselves to the population there in the north their opposition to the fascist regime was practically unknown and finally the referendum was flawed and performed in a country still in chaos and with large parts of the electorate unaccounted for.\n\nLast edited: May 7, 2018\n\nprinceofitaly\n\nNobility\n\nJoined\n\nJan 10, 2012\n\nMessages\n\n386\n\nCity\n\nTurin\n\nCountry\n\nItaly\n\nA wonderful portrait of Queen Maria José:\n\nhttps://www.instagram.com/p/BgDkEcwnwYq/?taken-by=mikethegap\n\nprinceofitaly\n\nNobility\n\nJoined\n\nJan 10, 2012\n\nMessages\n\n386\n\nCity\n\nTurin\n\nCountry\n\nItaly\n\nPhoto of Maria José with family:\n\nhttp://www.valledaostaglocal.it/fileadmin/archivio/valledaostaglocal/Maria-José5.jpg\n\nprinceofitaly\n\nNobility\n\nJoined\n\nJan 10, 2012\n\nMessages\n\n386\n\nCity\n\nTurin\n\nCountry\n\nItaly\n\nKing Umberto, Queen Maria José and the Formula 1 in Naples.\n\nThe Posillipo circuit changed its name several times.
