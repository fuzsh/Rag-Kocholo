        "text": "A marvelous rediscovery of Marolo gives us the “King” of Vermouth: structured, balsamic, fascinating in its soft balance between woods and spices. A great meditation Vermouth!\n\nUMBERTO I DI SAVOIA\n\nIf physiognomy were an exact science, Umberto I would be a textbook case. Chivalric carriage, chest outside, imperial mustache and a look that commands respect, reason and rigor. Militaristic physicist, dry and agile even in old age, and a natural predisposition to wear liveries, make Umberto I a character all in one piece: loved and respected, authoritative and feared, father of a nascent Italy crossed by strong social tensions and first fires of what will be the First World War.\n\nUMBERTO I DI SAVOIA\n\nIf physiognomy were an exact science, Umberto I would be a textbook case. Chivalrous gait, chest outside, imperial mustache and a look that commands respect, reason and rigor. Militaristic physicist, dry and agile even in old age, and a natural predisposition to wear liveries, make Umberto I a character all in one piece: loved and respected, authoritative and feared, father of a nascent Italy crossed by strong social tensions and first fires of what will be the First World War.\n\nSon of the first King of Italy, Vittorio Emanuele II, and of the Queen of the Kingdom of Sardinia, Maria Adelaide of Habsburg-Lorraine, Umberto I was born in Turin on March 14, 1844. His birth was welcomed with joy both by the royal family and by the Piedmontese people, because that ensured the male descent to a dynasty that at the time was proving to be the only one capable of guiding Italy towards independence. He received a military education, which formed his character in depth: he was in the front line during the battles against the Austrians, in the first and second war of Independence, distinguishing himself in the battle of Solferino and San Martino.\n\nHe was a warrior, but he also knew how to administer his image as father of the homeland. Shortly after the birth of the Kingdom of Italy, in 1868, he married Margherita of Savoy and with her he organized a special honeymoon. As a monarch of antiquity, Umberto and Margherita visited the main towns of their future kingdom. Wherever they went, the people paid them honors and festive receptions, effectively transforming the marriage event into a traveling celebration of the Unity of Italy, with Umberto I at its head.\n\nA “ROYAL” VERMOUTH\n\nThe Umbrian Red Vermouth Superior Domenico Ulrich is dedicated to Umberto I and his austere character. Born from a recipe from 1854 rediscovered and expertly reworked by Marolo, this Superior Vermouth is distinguished by nobility, intensity of flavor and a very particular use of botanicals. Borrowing the aging technique from the world of wine, the botanicals of Vermouth Rosso Superiore Domenico Ulrich, after extraction of the essences in alcohol, remain 6 months in wood for aging. A unique process, which gives intense and wonderful balsamic color, roundness of body and velvety tannins."
