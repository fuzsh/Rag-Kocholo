        "text": "The assassination of King Umberto I of Italy on July 29, 1900, was carried out by anarchist Gaetano Bresci. Motivated by anger over state repression, Bresci’s actions highlighted the rising tensions between anarchist groups and established governments.\n\nUmberto's Reign\n\nUmberto I, the son of Victor Emmanuel II and Archduchess Adelaide of Austria, was born on 14 March 1844 in Turin, then the capital of the Kingdom of Piedmont-Sardinia. As Crown Prince, Umberto was distrusted by his father and received no political or constitutional training, being raised in an environment devoid of affection. On 21 April 1868, he married his first cousin, Margherita Teresa Giovanna, Princess of Savoy. They had one son, Victor Emmanuel, Prince of Naples.\n\nUpon ascending the throne following his father’s death on 9 January 1878, Umberto adopted the title “Umberto I of Italy” rather than “Umberto IV” (of Savoy), disregarding his three ancestral namesakes, Umberto I, II, and III. In November, during a kingdom tour with Queen Margherita and Prime Minister Cairoli, he was attacked by anarchist Giovanni Passannante in Naples. The King deflected the dagger blow with his sabre, but Cairoli was severely wounded. Passannante was sentenced to death, although Umberto commuted the sentence to life penal servitude.\n\nIn foreign policy, Umberto I supported the Triple Alliance with Austria-Hungary and Germany, despite domestic opposition due to past conflicts with Austria. He admired Prussian-German militarism and was honoured by Emperor Wilhelm II, who suggested Umberto strengthen the Italian army to potentially abolish parliament and rule as a dictator.\n\nA major criticism of the policies carried out by the Prime Ministers appointed by Umberto was the continued power of organised crime in the Mezzogiorno (southern Italy), with the Mafia dominating Sicily and the Camorra dominating Campania. Social conditions in this area were dire, with high poverty and illiteracy rates. Despite this, Umberto prioritised military spending over social reforms, partially due to a secret promise to Wilhelm II to provide military support to Germany in a war with France.\n\nMoreover, the King favoured colonial expansion, supporting the occupation of Massawa in Eritrea and expansion into Somalia. He aspired to conquer Ethiopia, regardless of overwhelming public opposition, and backed the ultra-imperialist Prime Minister Francesco Crispi, allowing him to govern authoritatively. Umberto was suspected of aspiring to a vast empire in northeast Africa, a suspicion that diminished his popularity after the disastrous Battle of Adwa in Ethiopia in March 1896, which led to public frustration and demonstrations in Rome. Despite this, he maintained imperial ambitions, rejecting plans to sell Eritrea and blocking reductions in military spending.\n\nThe Events Leading to His Assassination\n\nThe late 1890s saw an upsurge in radical activity in Italy. Rising food prices led to many socialist and anarchist-inspired strikes and anti-government protests, particularly in Bologna and Lombardy. By the spring of 1898, these began to spread southwards, gaining momentum in Tuscany and strengthening the anarchist presence there. As the movement spread, increasing repression from the authorities followed. A state of siege was declared across Tuscany in early May, with anarchist and socialist press being suppressed and workers facing brutal attacks from the police.\n\nThe protests culminated in a massive demonstration in Milan on May 6. Thousands of workers and their families marched towards the Royal Palace, under heavy police and military guard. Angry about the high price of bread, many hungry workers attacked and raided bakeries, taking whatever bread they could find. As the rioting approached the palace, troops under General Bava-Beccaris were ordered to fire on the demonstrators. The exact number of people who died that day in Milan is uncertain, with estimates ranging widely. It is most likely that between 150-400 people were killed, with at least 1,000 wounded. Umberto’s telegram congratulating Beccaris and awarding him a medal outraged a large part of the population.\n\nAssassination\n\nThe assassination of Umberto I by silk weaver Gaetano Bresci occurred amidst the most violent period of anarchist history. Bresci, an immigrant to the US in the late 1890s, left the US in 1900 to travel to Italy and carry out his attack. Upon learning of the King’s plans to stay at the Royal House in Monza, he quickly departed for Milan and then travelled to Monza, arriving on July 26. Observing the royal party’s movements for several days, Bresci decided to act on July 29, when the King was scheduled to distribute prizes to athletes after a sporting competition.\n\nOn the evening of the 29th, the King arrived to scattered applause in an open-air carriage, climbed the podium, and distributed medals to the athletes. After a brief word of congratulations, he descended the platform and returned to his carriage. As he sat down, Bresci burst from the crowd, brandishing a revolver, and fired four times. The King died seconds later, having been hit three times in the chest. Bresci was quickly tackled by police agents and arrested.\n\nThe assassin stood trial in late August and was found guilty of assassinating the King. After serving less than a year of his life sentence on the island prison of Santo Stefano, he was found dead in his cell under extremely suspicious circumstances.\n\nAftermath\n\nUmberto was buried in the Pantheon in Rome next to his father Victor Emmanuel II, on 9 August 1900. He was the last Savoy to be buried there, as his son and successor Victor Emmanuel III died in exile and was buried in Egypt until his remains were transferred to Vicoforte in 2017.\n\nUmberto’s death marked a significant escalation in the wave of anarchist violence sweeping through Europe, heightening fears of political instability. In Italy, this prompted a crackdown on anarchist movements, leading to numerous arrests and stricter security measures. Beyond Italy, the assassination inspired radical actions across the Atlantic. American anarchist Leon F. Czolgosz cited Umberto I’s assassination as a direct influence on his decision to kill President McKinley in September 1901."
