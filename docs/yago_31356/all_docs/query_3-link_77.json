        "text": "New Delhi: Born along the western coast of Italy, pizza has covered a long journey over the years, making a special space in the hearts of fast-food lovers from across the globe. Standing in a different queue because of its high demand among youths, the pizza has various types. Margherita Pizza is considered to be the oldest and holds great significance for its name. Yes, it has been named after the queen of Italy, Margherita of Savoy and here in this article, we will take a look at some lesser-known facts about the queen.\n\nFacts to ponder about Queen Margherita\n\nThe wife of King Umberto I, Queen Margherita of Savoy, was the first Queen of a united Italy.\n\nBorn on November 20, 1851, to Prince Ferdinand of Savoy, Duke of Genoa and Princess Elisabeth of Saxony, Margherita, 17, tied the knot with her first cousin, King Umberto I, 24, of Italy.\n\nShe was a tall, blue-eyed blonde but not considered as beautiful as other queens. However, she was blessed with a charming attitude and an attractive style.\n\nWhen talking about her behaviours, she was a strong woman with a soft heart, sensitivity, and a strong will.\n\nThough she finally tied the knot with her cousin following the council’s decision, the marriage was not her choice, and she was initially supposed to marry Prince Charles of Romania.\n\nAs it was the council’s decision, her marriage was imperfect, and the couple stopped sharing their rooms two years after their great day. Victor Emmanuel was the first and the only child of the couple.\n\nEven before his marriage, Umberto had been in a long-term relationship with Eugenia, Duchess Litta Visconti Varese, an old woman and the true love of his life.\n\nDespite walking on two different paths in private, the couple always appeared as a devoted pair in public.\n\nUpon the succession of Umberto to the throne on January 9, 1878, Princess Margherita became Queen of Italy.\n\nShe reportedly turned into a stronger character and prominent strategist after an assassinating attempt at the king by Giovanni Passannante in November 1878.\n\nAfter having a long attack of pleurisy, Dowager Queen Margherita took her last breath in her villa in Bordighera on January 4, 1926, at the age of 74.\n\nInterestingly, the mining town of Margherita in the northern Indian state of Assam has been named after her.\n\nHow a pizza was named after her?\n\nOnce, the queen of Italy, Margherita, visited a pizzeria in Naples in 1889 to enjoy the taste of delicious food. She was served with flatbread topped with hand-crushed peeled tomatoes, fresh basil leaves, mozzarella (buffalo mozzarella or fior di latte), and extra virgin olive oil. Later, the dish was named pizza Margherita, now the most popular fast food globally."
