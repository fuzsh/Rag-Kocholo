        "text": "King Umberto I of Italy. Image from Wikimedia Commons\n\nUmberto I (born Umberto Rainerio Carlo Emanuele Giovanni Maria Ferdinando Eugenio di Savoia) reigned as the second King of a united Italy from January 9, 1878 until his assassination on July 29, 1900.\n\nBorn on March 14, 1844, Umberto was the second child and first son of King Victor Emmanuel II, by then King of Sardinia, and Archduchess Adelaide of Austria. He had four other siblings: Maria Clotilde, Princess Napoléon; Amadeo, later King of Spain; Oddone, Duke of Montferrat; and Maria Pia, afterwards Queen of Portugal.\n\nKing Umberto and Queen Margherita of Italy. Image from Wikimedia Commons.\n\nOn March 17, 1861, Victor Emmanuel was proclaimed King of a unified Italy and Umberto became the heir to the throne. Victor Emmanuel and Umberto, nevertheless, did not have an affectionate relationship. The king demanded reverence from his heir, while Umberto was told to be obedient and loyal. Distrustful of his son, Victor Emmanuel isolated him from matters concerning politics and constitutional governance. No wonder why Umberto veered towards conservativism and a reign that proved reactionary to his father's and he was brought up with no affection or love.\n\nUmberto was originally arranged to marry Mathilde of Austria as King Vittorio Emanuele II wanted to solidify the ties between Italy and Austria. The archduchess, however, unexpectedly died after her dress caught fire. Eventually, Umberto married his first cousin, Margherita Teresa Giovanna, Princess of Savoy on April 21, 1868. A son was born from this marriage, the heir to the throne, Victor Emmanuel, prince of Naples. The royal couple was a total opposite: Umberto was described as \"a colorless and physically unimpressive man, of limited intellect\" compared to Margherita's appearance, cultural interests and strong personality were to enhance the popularity of the monarchy.\n\nTwo years after their wedding, the couple ended their marital relations as Umberto was deeply involved with Eugenia Attendolo Bolognini, Duchess of Litta, with whom the future king of Italy had an affair even before marrying Margherita, and whom he considered as the love of his life. They never made their separation public and continuously worked as colleagues.\n\nKing Umberto and his only son and heir, the Prince of Naples. Image from Wikimedia Commons\n\nOn January 9, 1878, he succeeded as King of Italy following the death of King Victor Emmanuel. His reign saw Italy’s attempt at colonial expansion in the Horn of Africa, successfully gaining Eritrea and Somalia. The Italian defeat against Abyssinia (present-day Ethiopia) at the Battle of Adwa in 1896 dashed further attempts to expand the kingdom's colonies in Africa. In 1882, he approved the Triple Alliance with the German Empire and Austria-Hungary. Hugely unpopular at home, he was loathed in leftist circles for his conservatism and support of the Bava Beccaris massacre in Milan. The anarchists hated him and an attempt to assassinate him was staged in the first year of his reign. On January 29, 1900, anarchist Gaetano Bresci succeeded in assassinating King Umberto, two years after the Bava-Beccaris massacre."
