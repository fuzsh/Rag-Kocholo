        "text": "The house is one of the most solemn and majestic example of what the home of a member of the aristocracy of Pompeii had to look like and is characterised by impressive architectural solutions, such as the towering Corinthian columns made of tuff in the atrium. It also has a rhodium- type of peristylium, that is with the northern side higher than the other sides; an architectural approach noted also in other houses in Pompeii, such as the House of the Anchor and the House of the Golden Cupids. Some graffiti and inscriptions on many items led to the identification of Lucius Albucius Celsus as being the last owner of the house.\n\nThe current appearance of the building can be dated back to 40-30 BC when many rooms, especially those overlooking the atrium, were restored.\n\nThe house owes its name to the royal visit of Umberto I and Margherita of Savoy on their silver wedding anniversary in 1893.\n\nDate of excavation: 1883; 1891-1893; 1907-1908."
