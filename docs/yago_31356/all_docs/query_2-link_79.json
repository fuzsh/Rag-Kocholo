His parents were Amadeus III of Savoy and Mahaut (or Mafalda, or Matilda) of Albon, the sister of Guy IV of Dauphinois. His memorial day is March 4.\n\nAccording to Cope[1]:\n\n\"Umberto III, who reigned from 1149 to 1189...was a man of irresolute spirit who was disconsolate at being born a prince and preferred the seclusion of a monastery. He only renounced his chosen state of celibacy so as to give his land an heir.\"\n\nHis first wife died young; his second marriage ended in divorce. Umberto gave up and became a Carthusian monk. However, the nobles and common people of Savoy begged him to marry yet again, which he reluctantly did. This third wife gave him two more daughters, and Umberto attempted to return to the monastic life yet again. Finally he was prevailed upon to marry for a fourth time, and this wife, Beatrice, produced the son who would ultimately succeed him.\n\nIn 1188 he founded the Monastery of Sant'Antonio di Ranverso.\n\nFamily\n\nUmberto married four times:\n\nFaidiva of Toulouse (Italian) (d. abt 1154) daughter of Alphonse I of Toulouse\n\nGertrude of Flanders (m. abt 1155), whom he divorced and confined.
