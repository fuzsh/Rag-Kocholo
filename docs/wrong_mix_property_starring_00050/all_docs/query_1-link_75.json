        "text": "Hugh Keays-Byrne still owns the giant axe he used to \"chop up a car\" in a terrifying scene from the first Mad Max movie.\n\n\"It's actually a carcass-cleaving axe,\" said the 56-year old actor who played bikie gang leader Toecutter. \"It's a serious piece of work.\"\n\nSpeaking at a cast and crew reunion in Sydney yesterday marking the 25th anniversary of the film's release, Keays-Byrne said he had won the role after director George Miller saw him playing a bikie in the 1974 Australian movie Stone. Thanks to the international success of Mad Max, which went on to gross more than $150 million worldwide, many people still remember him as the axe-wielding outlaw.\n\n\"I get recognised about once a week,\" said the actor, who arrived in Australia in 1973 as a member of a Royal Shakespeare Company production of A Midsummer Night's Dream. \"It's amazing. I can be in the supermarket at Gosford and someone will come up and say 'Toecutter!'.\"\n\nMad Max star Mel Gibson didn't attend yesterday's reunion at the Belvoir Street Theatre, but Miller - who has postponed production of the fourth Mad Max film, Fury Road - was there. He traded memories with cast and crew members including stunt co-ordinator Grant Page and Steve Bisley, who played Gibson's on-screen partner, patrol officer Jim Goose.\n\n\"I guess the film just grabbed audiences at the right time,\" Bisley said. \"It's amazing how much stuff there is about it on the net.\"\n\nMad Max once held the record as the most profitable film on a cost-to-revenue basis. The cast and crew did not share the spoils, however, and there was talk yesterday about plans to create a new website selling Mad Max memorabilia and providing online information about the people who made the film.\n\nBisley said that in 1977 he was more interested in cash than a stake in the film's future earnings.\n\n\"I was straight out of drama school and had no money,\" he said. \"I just wanted the bucks in my back pocket.\"\n\nEnthused by the new website's potential, Keays-Byrne joked that replicas of his axe would soon be \"available online for a vast fee\"."
