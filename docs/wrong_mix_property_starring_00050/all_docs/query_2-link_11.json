        "text": "Serving Clients Throughout The State of Michigan\n\n“No.” People who have been injured on the job hear this word all the time.\n\nIf you or someone you love has a workplace injury, you have heard no from your employer, your employer’s workers’ compensation insurance carrier, the doctor and others. Hearing no over and over again can be discouraging and disheartening.\n\nI am Timothy S. Burns of Burns Law. My law firm’s mission is to stand up for working men and women who have been injured in the workplace. Based in Saginaw, my law firm turns no into yes for people throughout Michigan.\n\nThe Bottom Line Is Getting Results\n\nHurt doing construction work? Injured in an industrial accident? No longer able to work because of a disability? For more than 25 years I have devoted my career to serving injured working men and women. Over this time I have recovered WELL OVER $100 MILLION for my clients. These results are meaningful in many ways. First, they show my skill and tenacity in helping people who have suffered serious workplace injuries. More importantly, this money has made a significant difference in the lives of the people I serve.\n\nI provide workers’ compensation, Social Security Disability and personal injury claims services for clients throughout Michigan.\n\nAs a second-generation trial lawyer with more than 25 years of experience helping people recover compensation for injuries and disabilities, I know what it takes to get the job done."
