        "text": "Reps. Ty Burns, R-Pawnee, and John Pfeiffer, R-Orlando, recently honored former Oklahoma Highway Patrol Trooper Charlie Hanger with a replica of a sign designating mile marker 202 in Noble County as the \"Trooper Charlie Hanger Honorary Mile.\" This designation marks the location where Hanger apprehended Timothy McVeigh, Oklahoma's most notorious terrorist. \"It was an honor to commemorate Trooper Hanger and the events of that day,\" Burns said. \"Charlie will tell you there is no such thing as a routine traffic stop. This honorary mile is a thank you to all law enforcement officers who dedicate themselves to protecting our communities throughout the state.\" The presentation took place at Sequoyah State Park during the annual Retired Trooper Event. \"Trooper Charlie Hanger will go down in Oklahoma history rightfully as a hero, though he will claim that he was just doing his job and what every trooper would do,\" Pfeiffer said. \"His diligence and dedication do reflect the best of Oklahoma lawmen. His name will join those of Bill Tillman and Heck Thomas as Oklahoma heroes who did their jobs as peacekeepers and served the public and their state.\" This honorary mile is a tribute to Hanger's bravery and law enforcement officers' critical role in ensuring public safety across Oklahoma.\n\nReps. Collin Duel, R-Guthrie, and Ty Burns, R-Pawnee, invite all Oklahomans to attend the second annual Oklahoma Memorial Trail Ruck-Off in Guthrie, Oklahoma, on Saturday, May 18, 2024. The event aims to raise awareness about veteran issues, support military recruitment efforts and promote the newly created Oklahoma Military Trails. \"I encourage everyone to join us on May 18 in Guthrie, whether you're walking or attending the closing ceremony,\" Duel said. \"Your presence will help us honor and raise awareness for our veterans. I want to thank the City of Guthrie, Guthrie Chamber of Commerce and the Oklahoma Department of Veterans Affairs for their partnership in organizing this event.\" This year's ruck-off is named in honor of Pvt Oscar J. Upham, a U.S. Marine who earned the Medal of Honor during the Boxer Rebellion. Pvt. Upham passed away at the age of 77 in Guthrie, Oklahoma. \"Members of the Legislative Veteran's Caucus and several departments in Oklahoma have been working on this project for a while now,\" Burns said. \"We are thrilled to host it once again and excited to expand it to other regions of the state.\" The march will begin at 7:00 a.m. Participants can choose between a four-mile or a twelve-mile route, with or without a 35-pound ruck. The closing ceremony is scheduled for noon at the WPA Armory, located at 724 E. Logan Ave., Guthrie, Oklahoma.

Major General Thomas H. Mancino, the Adjutant General of the Oklahoma National Guard, addressed the audience and declared April 9, 2024, Oklahoma National Guard Appreciation Day. This day recognizes the National Guard's courage and dedication to their duty to serve their state and nation. \"From the battlefields of World War I, II, or Korea, to the mountains of Afghanistan and the Streets of Iraq, to domestic terrorism, tornados, floods, and now even three eclipses, your Oklahoma Army and Air National Guard have been there defending life, liberty, and freedoms from oppression around the world and ensuring the safety of the citizens of this, the greatest state in the greatest nation,\" Mancino said. \"Our whole state has been right there supporting us every step of the way. And we are so grateful for that support.\" Rep. Ty Burns, R-Pawnee, served in the National Guard for 20 years and retired as a Sergeant First Class in 2018. Also in attendance was General Colby Wyatt, who also served with Burns in the 179th Battalion, and Lieutenant Colonel Brent Weece, who was Burns' commanding officer during his time as a Captain in Afghanistan from 2011-2012. Weece was previously a Delta 179 Commander in Laghman and has recently returned as the Battalion Commander for deployments in African countries such as Djibouti, Kenya, and Somalia. \"It was great to see those I've served with, and stand alongside them again,\" Burns said. \"The thunderbird patch we wear represents our service and commitment to protecting our state and nation. It's an honor to stand among those who have answered the call to duty at home and overseas.\" In 2023, nearly 2,000 members of the Oklahoma National Guard answered the call to overseas duty, including the largest deployment in over a decade."
