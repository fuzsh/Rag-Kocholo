        "text": "Mad Max\n\nOriginal United States Movie poster\n\nCountry Australia Directed by George Miller Release Date 1979 Language English Studio Kennedy Miller Productions Distributor Roadshow Distributors\n\nMain Cast Character Actor \"Mad\" Max Rockatansky Mel Gibson Toecutter Hugh Keays-Byrne Goose Steve Bisley Roop Steve Millichamp\n\nMad Max is the 1979 post apocalyptic action film that launched the Mad Max film franchise. Mel Gibson stars in the film as Max Rockatansky, a law enforcement officer patrolling the vast roads of Australia with the Main Force Patrol. After a tragic incident, Max decides to take the law into his own hands to seek revenge. Directed by George Miller, the film would be followed to even greater success with 1982's The Road Warrior and then 1985's Mad Max Beyond Thunderdome. The success of these films would spawn many low budget film knockoffs throughout the next two decades. In 2015, George Miller would return to this world with a fourth feature film: Mad Max: Fury Road, which starred Tom Hardy as Max and a returning Hugh Keays-Byrne as warlord Immortan Joe.\n\nThe following weapons were used in the film Mad Max:\n\nWARNING! THIS PAGE CONTAINS SPOILERS!\n\nHandguns\n\nMauser C96 \"Broomhandle\"\n\nAfter initially being seen handling the distinctive wooden holster/stock, Bubba Zanetti (Geoff Parry) briefly attempts to use a Mauser C96 pistol to shoot a mannequin when the other bikers are messing around at the beach. He begins to aim, but stops when Johnny runs out in front of him with Toecutter's (Hugh Keays-Byrne) shotgun.\n\nSmith & Wesson Model 28\n\nThe MFP carry the Smith & Wesson Model 28 as their standard issue. Although they are rarely drawn and seen mostly in their holsters. When Max (Mel Gibson) puts on the \"Grumpy\" mask when his wife is mad that he is going in to work early because Goose wants him to, their baby is seen on the living room floor, apparently playing with Max's revolver.\n\nSmith & Wesson Model 13\n\nJim Goose (Steve Bisley) appears to carry a 3\" Smith & Wesson Model 13 when he and Max inspect the aftermath of the attacked couple. Bubba is seen firing one at Max near the end of the film.\n\nShotguns\n\nWinchester Model 1912\n\nMax carries a Winchester Model 1912 when he and Jim Goose inspect the aftermath of the attacked couple. It appears to be a long barreled sporting version.\n\nVG Bentley Double-Barreled Shotgun\n\nThe VG Bentley is first seen in the hands of eager MFP patrolman Roop (Steve Millichamp) when he tries to shoot the Night Rider in the film's opening. Another is used by Johnny (Tim Burns) to shoot a mannequin when the bikers are at the beach. Max also keeps one of these weapons close by after he resigns from MFP and goes traveling with his wife and child. A VG Bentley of the same model is listed below as the sawn-off, quite possibly the same shotgun used by Roop later cut down for Max's use. Notable are the same white ring around the base of the grip, the proportions of the steel receiver (namely the flat space between the end of the chamber and the back of the receiver), and the same checkering pattern and locking screw on the forearm.\n\nSawed-off VG Bentley Double-Barreled Shotgun\n\nLater in the movie Max (Mel Gibson) uses a sawn-off VG Bentley as his main weapon. Possibly the same weapon Roop carries, looking at the bluing patterns on the receiver and noting the extreme budget limits of the film. When battling against the Biker Gang, Max for some odd reason makes an effort to reach this shotgun when his leg is damaged while he has a Smith & Wesson Model 28 holstered that he doesn't even attempt to use.\n\nCharles Parker 1878 Side by Side Shotgun\n\nLate in the movie, \"Aunt May\" Swaisey (Sheila Florance), the old woman that Max and family are staying with, uses a very old, exposed-hammer shotgun, likely a Charles Parker 1878, to herd Toecutter's biker thugs into a shed.\n\nRifles\n\nWinchester Model 70"
