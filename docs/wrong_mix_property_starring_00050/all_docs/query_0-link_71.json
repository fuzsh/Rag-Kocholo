        "text": "Mad Max (1979)\n\nMel Gibson portrays Max Rockatansky, a fearless cop waging war with kill-crazy bikers who targeted his family. It's a war that must be seen to be believed, a road-scorching, neo-punk, take-no-prisoner combat set in a postapocalyptic Australia.\n\nContains a bonus DVD disc 'The Madness of Max', behind-the-scenes making od the film that started it all.\n\nThe Road Warrior (1981)\n\nFew films compare with this full-throttle epic of speed and carnage that rockets you into a dreamlike landscape where the post-nuclear future meets the mythological past. Gibson returns as a heroic loner Max, who drives the roads of outback Australia in an unending search for gasoline. Arrayed against him and the other scraggly defenders of a fuel-depot encampment are the bizarre warriors commanded by The Humungus.\n\nMad Max Beyond Thunderdome (1985)\n\nTwo men enter. One man leaves. That's the law in Bartertown's Thunderdome arena. In his third go-round as the title hero Gibson takes on the barbarians of the post-nuclear future â€“ and this time becomes the saviour of a tribe of lost children. Music superstar Tine Turner steals what's left of the screen as Aunty Entity, a power-mad dominatrix determined to use Max to tighten her stranglehold on Bartertown.\n\nMad Max: Fury Road (2015)\n\nHaunted by his turbulent past, Max (Tom Hardy) wanders alone until he's swept up with a group, led by Imperator Furiosa (Charlize Theron), fleeing across the Wasteland. In hot pursuit: a warlord who gathers his gang and pursues the rebels ruthlessly, leading to a high-octane road war in director George Miller's return to the world of Mad Max.\n\nContains the black and chrome edition on Blu-ray. In visually stunning black and white discover why mastermind director George Miller calls Black and Chrome, 'The best version of the movie'."
