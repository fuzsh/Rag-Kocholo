Kertész was best known for his novels “Fatelessness” and “Kaddish for a Child Not Born”. He was the first and only Hungarian author to receive a Nobel Prize for literature.

At the age of 14, Kertész was deported to the concentration camp at Auschwitz and later Buchenwald until his release in 1945, an experience that would inspire his most famous novel “Fatlessness” and a number of subsequent writings.

His early works were not well received by Hungarian critics and Kertesz struggled, taking on many jobs including factory work and a brief foray into journalism, according to online portal origo.hu. Kertész moved to Berlin a little over a decade ago and returned to Budapest just last year when his illness had progressed to its final stages, origo.hu reported.

According to origo.hu, Kertész once said that he was not interested in literature or writing, all he cared about was the “mechanism of power” and his aim was to uncover how it was possible that a human could turn into a killer or a victim in a fleeting moment.
