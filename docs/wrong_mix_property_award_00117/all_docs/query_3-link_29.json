        "text": "BUDAPEST, Hungary â€” Facing media in his homeland for the first time since winning the Nobel Prize for literature, Imre Kertesz praised the welcome he received but criticized what he considers a lack of Hungarian interest in the Holocaust.\n\nDespite the fact that the history of the Holocaust is taught in schools and an official memorial day was created last year, Kertesz said Friday the mass killing of millions of Jews remained \"on the fringe\" of Hungarian thinking despite the country's complicity in Nazi atrocities.\n\n\"I have been deeply touched by this outpouring of love,\" Kertesz said. \"But I know my books are not so popular here because the Holocaust is not embedded in Hungarian consciousness.\"\n\nKertesz was deported to the Auschwitz concentration camp at 14. The experience forms the basis of his novel \"Fateless,\" the 1975 novel that was singled out by the Nobel Prize judges.\n\nAround 600,000 Hungarian Jews were killed during the Holocaust, most transported to Auschwitz in the latter stages of World War II.\n\nAfter the war, discussion of the Holocaust was largely stifled by the Soviet-imposed socialist government.\n\n\"Hungarian society has still not faced the skeleton in the cupboard,\" Kertesz said. \"That is the systematic murder of the Hungarian Jews.\"\n\nKertesz, 72, said his new novel, which he is writing in Berlin, is set during Hungary's transition from communism to democracy in 1989.\n\n\"This will be my last novel about the Holocaust,\" said Kertesz. \"It takes place in Budapest at the time of the change of political system and deals with people who did not experience the Holocaust directly, the second generation, who still have to deal with the Holocaust.\"\n\nKertesz, the first Hungarian to win the Nobel Prize, also criticized the government's decision to provide every school in the country with a copy of \"Fateless.\"\n\n\"I am happy if young people read my books, but compulsory reading is bad,\" he said.\n\nHe also repeated earlier criticism of the English-language edition of Fateless. \"The translators wrote a different book,\" said Kertesz. \"People reading it will think, 'How did this writer win the Nobel Prize if he writes so sloppily?' \"\n\nA film adaptation of the book is under discussion, he said."
