        "text": "Imre Kertész (born November 9, 1929, Budapest, Hungary—died March 31, 2016, Budapest) was a Hungarian author best known for his semiautobiographical accounts of the Holocaust. In 2002 he received the Nobel Prize for Literature.\n\nAt age 14 Kertész was deported with other Hungarian Jews during World War II to the Auschwitz concentration camp in Nazi-occupied Poland. He was later sent to the Buchenwald camp in Germany, from which he was liberated in May 1945. Returning to Hungary, he worked as a journalist for the newspaper Világosság but was dismissed in 1951 following the communist takeover. He refused to submit to the cultural policies imposed by the new regime and turned to translation as a means of supporting himself. Kertész was highly praised as a translator specializing in the works of German-language authors, notably Friedrich Nietzsche, Hugo von Hofmannsthal, Sigmund Freud, Arthur Schnitzler, and Ludwig Wittgenstein.\n\nKertész was best known for his first and most-acclaimed novel, Sorstalanság (Fatelessness, or Fateless), which he completed in the mid-1960s but was unable to publish for nearly a decade. When the novel finally appeared in 1975, it received little critical attention but established Kertész as a unique and provocative voice in the dissident subculture within contemporary Hungarian literature. Sorstalanság features an adolescent narrator who is arrested and deported to a concentration camp, where he confronts the inexplicable horror of human degradation not with outrage or resistance but with seemingly incomprehensible complacency and detachment. For the narrator the brutal reality of atrocity and evil is reconciled by his inherent and inexorable will to survive—without remorse or a need for retribution. With the fall of communism in Hungary following what was deemed the “quiet revolution” in 1989, Kertész resumed an active literary role. With the publication in 1990 of the first German-language edition of the novel, his literary reputation began to expand in Europe, and the novel was later published in more than 10 languages. Kertész also adapted his novel as a film (2005)."
