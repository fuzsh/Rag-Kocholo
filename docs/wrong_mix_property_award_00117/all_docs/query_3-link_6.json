        "text": "In 1944, when he was fourteen, the Hungarian writer Imre Kertész was arrested and deported to Auschwitz and, from there, to Buchenwald. He was liberated in 1945, and returned to Budapest, where he became a Communist, then a dissident journalist and a novelist, essayist, and translator. In 2002, he was awarded Nobel Prize in Literature. The novels “Fatelessness,” “Fiasco,” and “Kaddish for an Unborn Child” are all rooted in Kertész’s experience in concentration camps, though he insists on the distinction between autobiographical fiction and autobiography. “Dossier K,” which came out in 2006 and will published in English by Melville House on May 7th, is an autobiography, but an unconventional one—it unfolds in the form of a self-interview. It is Kertész’s response to the rash of profiles of him that were published after he won the Nobel Prize. Kertész poses pointed, cantankerous, provocative questions to Kertész. What follows is an excerpt.\n\n—The Editors\n\nIn “Fiasco” you write: “When I was fourteen and a half, through a conjunction of infinitely inane circumstances, I found myself looking down the barrel of a loaded machine gun for half an hour.” I suppose that must have happened in the barracks of the gendarmerie. Why was that episode left out of “Fatelessness”?\n\nFrom the novel’s perspective, it was a purely anecdotal element, that’s why it had to be left out.\n\nYet from the perspective of your own life it must nevertheless have been a fairly decisive element …\n\nDoes that mean I’m going to have to say something about things that I never wished to talk about?\n\nThen why did you write about it?\n\nPerhaps precisely so I would not have to talk about it.\n\nDo you find it that difficult?\n\nYou know, this is just like the interviews with elderly survivors in that Spielberg series. I hate all those kind of statements like “They herded us into the stables … They drove us out into a courtyard … They took us off to the brick works in Budakalász,” and the like.\n\nIsn’t that what happened?\n\nIn the novel, yes, it did. But then a novel is fiction…\n\nWhich in your case I know is based on reality. How was it that you came to be in that narrow courtyard at the gendarmerie barracks?\n\nAll things considered, exactly as I described in “Fatelessness.” In the middle of the night—I was fast asleep, resting against the knees of the person behind me, and the person in front of me was resting against my drawn-up legs—I wakened to the sound of shouting and sirens wailing. A minute later and I was standing there, in the yard, under a moonlit sky across which successive squadrons of bomber aircraft were passing. On the low walls drunken gendarmes were squatting behind machine guns trained on the mass of people who were crowded into the barracks courtyard—on us. But there’s no point in my telling you this; you can read a much better account of it in “Fiasco.”\n\nYes, but there it seems that the boy hasn’t a clue about the whole thing, about how he came to be there.\n\nThat, in essence, was how it was.\n\nWere you never interested in what I might call the historical background to that scene?\n\nOf course, it’s just that the circumstances weren’t so easy…\n\nThe reality, you mean, not the fiction…\n\nI wouldn’t draw such a sharp distinction between the two, but let’s drop that for now. The trouble was that under the Kádár regime it was extraordinarily difficult to get hold of any documentation—particularly during the Sixties, when I was writing “Fatelessness.” It was as though they were in cahoots with the Nazi past, the way that all documentation was hidden away: one had to pull out the mostly deficient material from the very back shelves of libraries, and publishing at the time drew a total veil over the past. Nevertheless, I finally managed to piece together that what had lain behind my arrest was a gendarme putsch that had been planned to go ahead in late June 1944. The aim of the putsch, in essence, was to enable the deportation of the Jewish residents of Budapest to Germany to proceed. As we now know, once Horthy saw what the outcome of the Second World War was going to be, and bearing in mind the declaration the Allied powers had made that when the war was over anybody who had had a hand in the extermination of Jews in Europe was going to be called to account, he ordered a halt to the deportations from Budapest, which was the area over which he had tight control. The gendarmerie wanted to revoke that. As a first step, they threw a ring round Budapest one day at dawn and set up control points at the city’s administrative boundaries. Anyway, the gendarmerie somehow managed to pull in the regular police, and on that day the police arrested all the people wearing yellow stars who stepped over the city limits, whether or not a person had a specific permit to do so. That was how I was arrested along with my companions, eighteen of us, all boys of fourteen or fifteen, who were working at the Shell Oil refinery just outside the city limits.\n\nAs far as I know, the gendarme putsch eventually failed.\n\nThat’s right. Lieutenant General László Faragho, who, alongside His Serene Highness the Regent, was joint head of the gendarmerie, got notice of the brewing putsch in time, and for his part, he concentrated the regular army troops under his command and duly won the gendarmes round to giving up their plan.\n\nBut by then they had caught you. Did that also happen the way you described it in “Fatelessness?”\n\nExactly so.\n\nSo, it was the reality that you wrote down after all. Why are you so insistent on the term “fiction”?\n\nLook here, that’s a pretty basic issue. A couple of decades later, when I decided that I was going to write a novel, I was obliged to sort out, for my personal use so to say, what the difference was between the genres of the novel and the autobiography, “memoirs,” if only to stop me from adding yet another book to what already back in Sixties had swollen into a library of, how should I put it…\n\nHolocaust literature. Isn’t that what you wanted to say?\n\nYes, that’s what it’s called nowadays. Back then, in the Sixties, the word “Holocaust” wasn’t familiar; it only came into use later on—and incorrectly at that. I’ve just recalled what is was called back them: Lager literature.\n\nThat’s a better classification?\n\nLet’s not get into considering the point now.\n\nAgreed, but we shall come back to it later on. What would be of more interest to me right now is the difference between fiction and autobiography, as critics and readers alike commonly refer to “Fatelessness” as an autobiographical novel.\n\nIncorrectly, I have to say, because no such genre exists. A book is either autobiography or a novel. If it’s autobiography you evoke the past, you try as scrupulously as possible to stick to your recollections; it’s a matter of extraordinary importance that you write everything down exactly the way it happened, as it’s usually put: that you don’t varnish the facts one little bit. A good autobiography is like a document: a mirror of the age on which people can “depend.” In a novel, by contrast, it’s not the facts that matter, but precisely what you add to the facts.\n\nBut as far as I’m aware—and it’s something that you have repeatedly confirmed in statements you have made— your novel is absolutely authentic; that every facet of the story is based on documented facts.\n\nThat’s not inconsistent with its being fictional. Quite the opposite. In “Fiasco” I describe just how far I went in the interests of summoning up the past, in order to reawaken in myself the atmosphere of the camps.\n\nYou used to sniff the strap of your wristwatch …\n\nYes, because somehow or other the whiff of freshly tanned leather reminded me of the smell that used to build up between the barrack blocks in Auschwitz. Slivers of reality like that are, of course, very important for fiction as well. But there is still a crucial difference in that while autobiography is a recollection of something, fiction creates a world of some kind.\n\nTo my way of thinking, remembrance is also the recreation of a portion of the world.\n\nBut without going beyond that portion of the world; yet that’s what happens in fiction. The world of fiction is a sovereign world that comes to life in the author’s head and follows the rules of art, of literature. And that is the major difference that is reflected in the form of the work, in its language and its plot. An author invents every aspect of a fiction, every detail.\n\nBut you can’t mean to say that you invented Auschwitz?\n\nBut in a certain sense that is exactly so. In the novel I did have to invent Auschwitz and bring it to life; I could not fall back on externalities, on so-called historical facts outside the novel; everything had to come into being hermetically, through the magic of the language and composition. Look at the book from that point of view. From the very first lines you can already get a feeling that you have entered a strange sovereign realm in which everything or, to be more accurate, anything can happen. As the story progresses, the sense of being abandoned increasingly takes hold of the reader; there is a growing sense of the losing one’s footing …\n\nYes. Non habent sua fata libelli—books do not have their own fate—as György Spiró put it in his memorable 1983 essay, which as it happened was the first major assessment of “Fatelessness” that had been printed in Hungary since its publication in 1975. But that is to getting far beside the point; we have digressed a long way from that barracks courtyard. We were at the point where the gendarmes …\n\nDeclared that they had seen us signaling by candlelight from the stables to the RAF aircraft.\n\nYou’re kidding!\n\nNot at all; that really is what they said. At first I too took it to be some sort of joke, but then I could see they weren’t joking at all. If so much as one bomb were to be dropped near us, they would “hack us to pieces”—that was the threat, and it was clear that they could hardly wait for that bomb to be dropped. They were in a murderous mood, most of them dead drunk, like hyenas that have caught the scent of blood. It was a brilliant scene, in fact, and yet it didn’t fit into “Fatelessness.” It almost broke my heart to leave it out, but then there you are: that’s fiction for you. Remorseless in its laws. But then I managed to salvage the scene in “Fiasco.”\n\nHow can you be so … so …\n\nCynical?\n\nI didn’t want to say it.\n\nYou won’t offend me, I look on my life as raw material for my novels: that’s just the way I am, and it frees me from any inhibitions.\n\nIn that case, let me ask: What did you feel that night, when you had not yet acquired that … I would not say cynicism so much as irony to maintain you detachment? The irony with which, after all, you came face to face with death? Weren’t you afraid?\n\nI probably was, but I no longer recall. What was much more important, though, was a kind of recognition that I managed to formulate many years later in “Fiasco”: “I grasped the simple secret of the universe that had been disclosed to me: I could be gunned down anywhere, at any time.”\n\nA devastating realization.\n\nYes, and yet also not. You know, it is not so easy to dampen the joie de vivre of a fourteen-year-old boy, especially if he is surrounded by pals of the same age who are sharing his fate. There is a … an unspoiled innocence about him that protects him from a sense of being completely defenseless, completely without hope. In that sense, an adult can be broken much more quickly.\n\nIs that perception based on your own experiences, or is it something you heard or read about later on?\n\nIt was something that I both observed for myself and also read about. Look, let’s be frank here. Among the masses of books on the subject on the same sort of subject only very few are truly able genuinely to put into words the unparalleled experience of being in the Nazi death camps. And it is perhaps the essays of Jean Améry that say the most, even among those exceptional authors. He has a superbly precise word: Weltvertrauen, which I would translate as “trust in the world.” Well, he writes about how hard it is to live without that trust, and once a person has lost it he is condemned to perpetual solitude among people. A person like that will never again be able to see fellow men but only ever anti-men (Mitmenschen and Gegenmenschen are the original expressions). That trust was beaten out of Améry by the Gestapo when he was tortured in Fort Breendonk, a Belgian fort that was set up as a prison. In vain did he survive Auschwitz; decades later he carried out the sentence on himself by committing suicide.\n\nIt’s typical that those superb—terrifyingly superb—essays appeared in Hungarian translation only recently in the low-circulation publication Múlt és Jövo [Past and Future], and even that was only a modest selection from Améry’s works. But to go back to “trust in the world.”\n\nIndeed, and I think that even at the extreme of my own most emaciated state of physical deterioration that trust … even if I was not exactly radiating it, it must have been plain to see. I simply supposed that the adult world had a duty to save me from that and get me home in one piece. That sounds rather funny today, but it really was the way I felt. I firmly believe that I have that childish trust to thank for my being rescued.\n\nThis excerpt is drawn from “Dossier K,” by Imre Kertész, translated by Tim Wilkinson, to be published by Melville House on May 7, 2013.\n\nPhotograph by Isolde Ohlbaum/Laif/Redux."
