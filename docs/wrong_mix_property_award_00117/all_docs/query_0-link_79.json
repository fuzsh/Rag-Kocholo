He was awarded the Nobel Prize in Literature in 2002 for \"writing that elevates the experience of the individual beyond the contradictions of brutal history.\"⁠\n⁠\nHe was born in a poor Jewish family. In 1944 he was sent to the German concentration camp Auschwitz-Birkenau. His entire family, except for his mother, died during the war. He used his camp experiences in the novel \"Fatelessness\".⁠\n⁠\nHe is the first Hungarian to be awarded the literary Nobel Prize. He received many other awards, including the Brandenburger Literaturpreis (1995), the Leipziger Buchpreis (1997), and the Grand Cross of the Order of St. Stefan (2014)—the most important Hungarian distinction. His books have been translated into many languages.⁠\n⁠\nThe movie \"Fateless\" from 2005 was made based on his novel. For his directing, Lajos Koltai was nominated for a Golden Bear at the Berlin Film Festival.⁠\n⁠\nHe died in 2016 in Budapest. His writing describes the human condition in an extremely up-to-date manner.⁠\nImre Kertész is one of the most outstanding authors from the countries of the Visegrad Group, uniting the countries of Central Europe: Poland, Hungary, the Czech Republic, and Slovakia. Poland is leading the Group in 2020/2021. #V4 #ImreKertesz\".",
