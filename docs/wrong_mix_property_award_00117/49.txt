A SURVIVOR of the Holocaust has won the Nobel Prize for Literature. Imre Kertész, 72, is the first Hungarian to win the award, worth about £690,000.

Although barely known in Britain, Kertész is highly regarded in Germany and Western Europe, where his books are regarded as being among Europe’s most important literary works to deal with the Holocaust and the Nazi era.

“My immediate reaction is one of great joy. It means very much to me,” Kertész said yesterday.

He was born in Budapest and was one of 450,000 Hungarian Jews deported to Auschwitz in the early summer of 1944. He was later transferred to Buchenwald, which was liberated in 1945.
