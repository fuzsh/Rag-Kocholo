President Roh Moo-hyun has proposed that South Korea adopt a new presidential system that allows the country's leader to seek re-election while reducing the term of office.

Roh said in a nationally televised speech that he would seek to revise the constitution to change the current single five-year presidential term to two four-year terms, saying it was one of his campaign pledges.

Roh was not seeking re-election himself, the presidential office said.
