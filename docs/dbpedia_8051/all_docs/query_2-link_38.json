        "text": "Employment Rate Hits All-Time High for 30 Consecutive Months, Unemployment Rate Hits All-Time Low\n\nIn July 2024, the employment rate for those aged 15 and above reached 63.3% (+0.1%p), marking the highest level for 30 consecutive months. Meanwhile, the unemployment rate recorded a historic low of 2.5% (a decrease of 0.2 %p). * Employment indicators for July (2023→2024, %): 63.2 → 63.3 2.7 → 2.5 The growth in the number of employed persons also surged compared to that of the previous month, reaching a double-digit growth (172,000). This indicates a strengthening in the employment growth trend compared to May and June. * Change in employment growth, 2024 (year-on-year, ten thousand): (Jan) +38.0 (Feb) +32.9 (Mar) +17.3 (Apr) +26.1 (May) +8.0 (Jun) +9.6 (Jul) +17.2 By industry, job growth in the service sector significantly expanded (+183,000 to +286,000), leading the overall employment growth. Notably, the education services sector saw a turnaround with employment rising from a decrease of 63,000 to an increase of 2,000; the information and communication sector (+75,000 to +82,000) and the transportation and storage sector (+47,000 to +65,000) also experienced larger increases. On the other hand, employment in construction (-81,000), manufacturing (-11,000), and agriculture, forestry, and fishing (-26,000) sectors fell. By employment type, the number of full-time workers climbed up by 96,000, and the number of temporary workers rose by 227,000. The decline in non-wage workers reduced compared to that of the previous month (-127,000 to -80,000). By age group, employment rates moved up across most age groups, including those in their 30s, 40s, and older adults. Although the employment rate for young people (46.5%) fell by -0.5%p from a year ago, the employment rate for those in their late 20s (72.4%) increased by 0.2 %p, reversing its downward trend after three months and reached an all-time high. The government plans to shore up efforts to boost domestic demand and enhance job support tailored to vulnerable sectors in order to spread the export-driven economic recovery to employment and people’s livelihoods. The ‘Support Package for Small Business Owners’ and ‘Measures to Expand Housing Supply’ (August 8) will be swiftly carried out and the ‘Construction Cost Stabilization Plan’ will be developed by September. Along with the efforts to resolve the unmet demand for construction jobs, the government will be committed to enhancing job transition and livelihood support by providing tailored on-site employment services for construction day laborers and strengthening training support equivalent to that for special employment support industries. Also, a pilot program of the ‘Youth Employment All-Care Platform’ will start on August 16, offering job services to unemployed graduates. Going forward, the government will continue to meticulously review employment conditions for each sector and demographic group through a cross-ministerial job task force and actively seek additional support tools as needed.

During the visit, they encouraged the employees and assessed the operational status, emphasizing the importance of proactive involvement by the industry insiders to ensure smooth personnel supply, in accordance with the collaborative budget plan for foreign labor policies announced on August 7. DPM Choi highlighted that in line with the status of the Korean society as a multicultural nation, it is crucial to transition from a quantitative growth approach focused on addressing short-term labor shortages to a qualitative growth structure that considers long-term demographic changes and labor supply. He underscored the importance of interdepartmental collaboration and continuous, active communication with relevant associations and industries to achieve the early establishment of the collaborative budget. In addition, he pledged to work on tackling on-site challenges from the perspective of foreign workers through measures such as the establishment of visa pathways that facilitate their eventual settlement in local communities DPM Choi then visited Mirae Aerospace to inspect the working conditions of foreign workers. He noted that in the advance field of aerospace, attracting not just basic-skilled foreign labor but also highly talented international experts could meet the on-site labor demands while simultaneously enhancing global competitiveness, thereby achieving a dual benefit. Next, DPM Choi visited KASA and had lunch with the staff while receiving briefing on the current status of operation and challenges of the newly established (May 2024) space agency. He commended the employees for their significant efforts to achieve the new system’s rapid settlement despite it being the first year of the agency’s operation. In particular, he urged the agency to focus on innovative and economically impactful research in the aerospace field, in line with the institute’s founding purpose, as its legally guaranteed leeway in terms of manpower and financial management provides a conducive environment for proactive and aggressive policy implementation. Lastly, DPM Choi stressed that the ultimate success of foreign labor policies is determined by the local ‘settlement’ of foreign residents; therefore, the role of local SMEs and relevant associations that interact with foreigners on the ground is crucial. He asked everyone who attended the meeting to actively engage in their work, remembering that they play a pivotal role in determining the sustainability of Korea’s economy and society going forward. Furthermore, he reminded them that the shift in foreign labor policies has become a ‘necessity, not an option’, given both domestic and international conditions, and reassured policy authorities’ commitment to continuing communication with foreign residents, related industry associations, and local businesses to build a sustainable collaboration system for foreign labor policy.
