        "text": "Elections in South Korea are held on a national level to select the President and the National Assembly. Local elections are held every four years to elect governors, metropolitan mayors, municipal mayors, and provincial and municipal legislatures.\n\nThe president is directly elected for a single five-year term by plurality vote. The National Assembly has 300 members elected for a four-year term, 253 in single-seat constituencies and 47 members by proportional representation. Each individual party willing to represent its policies in the National Assembly is qualified on the legislative (general) election if: i) the national party-vote reaches over 3% on proportional contest or ii) more than 5 members of the party are elected from each of their first-past-the-post election constituencies.[1]\n\nVoting\n\n[edit]\n\nEligibility\n\n[edit]\n\nAll citizens over the age of 18 have the right to vote. According to Article 34 of the 'Immigration Control Act,' a non-Korean citizen registered in the relevant local constituency and who has had a resident visa for at least three years has the right to vote in local elections.[2]\n\nVoting methods\n\n[edit]\n\nVoting methods of South Korea[3][4] Office Methods Electoral district President of South Korea first-past-the-post National Member of the National Assembly first-past-the-post Constituencies and Party List Metropolitan Mayor/Governor first-past-the-post Provinces Member of the Metropolitan Council first-past-the-post Constituencies and Party List Superintendent of Education non-partisan first-past-the-post Provinces Municipal Mayor first-past-the-post Municipal divisions Member of the Municipal Council Single non-transferable vote Constituencies and Party List\n\nElection technology\n\n[edit]\n\nPolling places are usually located in schools. During the absentee or early voting period, voters can vote at any place in the country. On election day, voters may only vote at polling places in their registered constituency. Korean voters mark paper ballots with a rubber stamp using red ink. There is one race per ballot paper; if there are multiple offices up for election, ballot papers are colour-coded and voters are issued one ballot per race.[5]\n\nKorea uses a central count model. After the polls close, ballot boxes are sealed and transported to the constituency's counting centre. Traditionally ballots were hand-counted, and optical scanners have been adopted since 3rd local elections held on 13 June 2002. The scanners resemble cash sorter machines, sorting the ballots into stacks by how they are voted. Stacks are then counted using machines resembling currency counting machines.[6]\n\nKorean elections have been praised as a model of best practice.[5] However, the legality of the introduction of optical scan technology has been challenged and there have been allegations of rigged counting.[6]\n\nSchedule\n\n[edit]\n\nElection\n\n[edit]\n\nPosition 2022 2023 2024 2025 2026 2027 Type Presidential (May)\n\nLocal (June) None National Assembly (April) None Local (June) Presidential (March) President President None President National Assembly None All seats None Provinces, cities and municipalities All positions None All positions None\n\nInauguration\n\n[edit]\n\nPosition 2022 2023 2024 2025 2026 2027 Type Presidential (May)\n\nLocal (July) None National Assembly (May) None Local (July) Presidential (May) President May 10 None May 10 National Assembly None May 30 None Provinces, cities and municipalities July 1 None July 1 None\n\nLatest elections\n\n[edit]\n\n2024 legislative election\n\n[edit]\n\n2022 presidential election\n\n[edit]\n\n2022 local elections\n\n[edit]\n\nSummary of past elections\n\n[edit]\n\nPresidential elections\n\n[edit]\n\nLegislative elections\n\n[edit]\n\nLocal elections\n\n[edit]\n\n2010 South Korean local elections\n\n2014 South Korean local elections\n\n2018 South Korean local elections\n\n2022 South Korean local elections\n\nSee also\n\n[edit]\n\nHistory of South Korea\n\nConstitution of South Korea\n\nElectoral calendar\n\nElectoral system\n\nNotes\n\n[edit]\n\nFurther reading\n\n[edit]\n\nNahm, A.C.
