The president acts as the head of state and is the highest figure of executive authority in the country, followed by the prime minister and government ministers in decreasing order.[1]\n\nThe Executive and Legislative branches operate primarily at the national level, although various ministries in the executive branch also carry out local functions. Local governments are semi-autonomous and contain executive and legislative bodies of their own. The judicial branch operates at both the national and local levels. The South Korean government's structure is determined by the Constitution of the Republic of Korea. This document has been revised several times since its first promulgation in 1948 (for details, see History of South Korea). However, it has retained many broad characteristics; with the exception of the short-lived Second Republic of South Korea, the country has always had a relatively independent chief executive in the form of a president.\n\nAs with most stable three-branch systems, a careful system of checks and balances is in place. For instance, the judges of the Constitutional Court are partially appointed by the executive, and partially by the legislature. Likewise, when a resolution of impeachment is passed by the legislature, it is sent to the judiciary for a final decision.\n\nLegislative branch\n\n[edit]\n\nMain article: National Assembly (South Korea)\n\nAt the national level, the legislative branch consists of the National Assembly of South Korea. This is a unicameral legislature; it consists of a single large assembly. Most of its 300 members are elected from-member constituencies; however, 56 are elected through proportional representation. The members of the National Assembly serve for four years; if a member is unable to complete his or her term, a by-election is held. The National Assembly is charged with deliberating and passing legislation, auditing the budget and administrative procedures, ratifying treaties, and approving state appointments. In addition, it has the power to impeach or recommend the removal of high officials.\n\nThe Assembly forms 17 standing committees to deliberate matters of detailed policy. For the most part, these coincide with the ministries of the executive branch.\n\nBills pass through these committees before they reach the floor. However, before they reach committee, they must already have gained the support of at least 20 members, unless they have been introduced by the president. To secure final passage, a bill must be approved by a majority of those present; a tie vote defeats the bill. After passage, bills are sent to the president for approval; they must be approved within 15 days.\n\nEach year, the budget bill is submitted to the National Assembly by the executive. By law, it must be submitted at least 90 days before the start of the fiscal year, and the final version must be approved at least 30 days before the start of the fiscal year. The Assembly is also responsible for auditing accounts of past expenditures, which must be submitted at least 120 days before the start of the fiscal year.\n\nSessions of the Assembly may be either regular (once a year, for no more than 100 days) or extraordinary (by request of the president or a caucus, no more than 30 days). These sessions are open-door by default but can be closed to the public by majority vote or by decree of the Speaker. In order for laws to be passed in any session, a quorum of half the members must be present.\n\nCurrently, seven political parties are represented in the National Assembly.\n\nExecutive branch\n\n[edit]\n\nThe executive branch is headed by the president.[2] The president is elected directly by the people, and is the only elected member of the national executive.[3] The president serves for one five-year term; additional terms are not permitted.[4] The president is head of state, head of government and commander-in-chief of the South Korean armed forces.[5][6] The president is vested with the power to declare war, and can also propose legislation to the National Assembly.[7][8] The president can also declare a state of emergency or martial law, subject to the Assembly's subsequent approval.[9] The President can veto bills, subject to a two-thirds majority veto override by the National Assembly.[10] However, the president does not have the power to dissolve the National Assembly. This safeguard reflects the experience of authoritarian governments under the First, Third, and Fourth Republics.\n\nThe president is assisted in his or her duties by the Prime Minister of South Korea as well as the Presidential Secretariat.[11] The Prime Minister is appointed by the president upon the approval of the National Assembly, and has the power to recommend the appointment or dismissal of the Cabinet ministers.[12] The officeholder is not required to be a member of the National Assembly. The Prime Minister is assisted in his/her duties by the Prime Minister's Office which houses both the Office for Government Policy Coordination and the Prime Minister’s Secretariat (국무총리비서실; 國務總理祕書室), the former of which is headed by a cabinet-level minister and the latter by a vice minister-level chief of staff.[13] if the president is unable to fulfill his duties, the Prime Minister assumes the president's powers and takes control of the state until the President can once again fulfill his/her duties or until a new president is elected.[14]\n\nIf they are suspected of serious wrongdoing, the president and cabinet-level officials are subject to impeachment by the National Assembly.[15] Once the National Assembly votes in favor of the impeachment the Constitutional Court should either confirm or reject the impeachment resolution, once again reflecting the system of checks and balances between the three branches of the government.[16]\n\nThe State Council is the highest body and national cabinet for policy deliberation and resolution in the executive branch of the Republic of Korea. The Constitution of the Republic of Korea mandates that the Cabinet be composed of between 15 and 30 members including the Chairperson, and currently the Cabinet includes the President, the Prime Minister, the Vice Prime Minister (the Minister of Strategy and Finance), and the cabinet-level ministers of the 17 ministries.[17] The Constitution designates the President as the chairperson of the Cabinet and the Prime Minister as the vice chairperson.[18] Nevertheless, the Prime Minister frequently holds the meetings without the presence of the President as the meeting can be lawfully held as long as the majority of the Cabinet members are present at the meeting. Also, as many government agencies have moved out of Seoul into other parts of the country since 2013,[19] the need to hold Cabinet meetings without having to convene in one place at the same time has been growing, and therefore the law has been amended to allow Cabinet meetings in a visual teleconference format.[20] Although not the official members of the Cabinet, the chief presidential secretary (대통령비서실장; 大統領祕書室長), the Minister of the Office for Government Policy Coordination (국무조정실장; 國務調整室長), the Minister of Government Legislation (법제처장; 法制處長), the Minister of Food and Drug Safety (식품의약품안전처장; 食品醫藥品安全處長), the Chairperson of Korea Fair Trade Commission (공정거래위원장; 公正去來委員長), the Chairperson of Financial Services Commission (금융위원장; 金融委員長), the Mayor of Seoul, and other officials designated by law or deemed necessary by the Chairperson of the Cabinet can also attend the Cabinet meetings and speak in front of the Cabinet without the right to vote on the matters discussed in the meetings [21] The Mayor of Seoul, although being the head of a local autonomous region in South Korea and not directly related to the central executive branch, has been allowed to attend the Cabinet meeting considering the special status of Seoul (Special City) and its mayor (the only cabinet-level mayor in Korea).\n\nIt has to be noted that the Cabinet of the Republic of Korea performs somewhat different roles than those of many other nations with similar forms. As the Korean political system is basically a presidential system yet with certain aspects of parliamentary cabinet system combined, the Cabinet of the Republic of Korea also is a combination of both systems. More specifically, the Korean Cabinet performs policy resolutions as well as policy consultations to the President. Reflecting that the Republic of Korea is basically a presidential republic the Cabinet resolutions cannot bind the president's decision, and in this regard, the Korean Cabinet is similar to those advisory counsels in strict presidential republics. At the same time, however, the Constitution of the Republic of Korea specifies in details 17 categories including budgetary and military matters, which necessitates the resolution of the Cabinet in addition to the President's approval, and in this regard the Korean Cabinet is similar to those cabinets in strict parliamentary cabinet systems.[22]\n\nThe official residence and office of the President of the Republic of Korea is Cheongwadae, located in Jongno-gu, Seoul. The name \"Cheongwadae\" literally means \"the house with blue-tiled roof\" and is named as such due to its appearance. In addition to the Office of the President, Cheongwadae also houses the Office of National Security and the Presidential Security Service to assist the President.[23]\n\nMinistries\n\n[edit]\n\nCurrently, 18 ministries exist in the South Korean government.[24] The 18 ministers are appointed by the President and report to the Prime Minister. Also, some ministries have affiliated agencies (listed below), which report both to the Prime Minister and to the minister of the affiliated ministry. Each affiliated agency is headed by a vice-minister-level commissioner except Prosecution Service which is led by a minister-level Prosecutor General.\n\nThe Minister of Strategy and Finance and the Minister of Education, by law, automatically assume the positions of Deputy Prime Ministers of the Republic of Korea.\n\nThe respective ministers of the below ministries assume the President's position in the below order, if the President cannot perform his/her duty and the Prime Minister cannot assume the President's position. Also note that the Constitution and the affiliated laws of the Republic of Korea stipulates only so far as the Prime Minister and the 17 ministers as those who can assume the President's position.[14] Moreover, if the Prime Minister cannot perform his/her duty the Vice Prime Minister will assume the Prime Minister's position, and if both the Prime Minister and the Vice Prime Minister cannot perform the Prime Minister's role the President can either pick one of the 17 ministers to assume the Prime Minister's position or let the 17 ministers assume the position according to the below order.[25]\n\nThe commissioner of National Tax Service, a vice-minister-level official by law, is customarily considered to be a minister-level official due to the importance of National Tax Service. For example, the vice-commissioner of the agency will attend meetings where other agencies would send their commissioners, and the commissioner of the agency will attend meetings where minister-level officials convene.\n\nMinistry of Economy and Finance (기획재정부; 企劃財政部)\n\nNational Tax Service (국세청; 國稅廳)\n\nKorea Customs Service (관세청; 關稅廳)\n\nPublic Procurement Service (조달청; 調達廳)\n\nStatistics Korea (통계청; 統計廳)\n\nMinistry of Education (교육부; 敎育部)\n\nMinistry of Science and ICT (과학기술정보통신부; 科學技術情報通信部)\n\nMinistry of Foreign Affairs (외교부; 外交部)\n\nOverseas Koreans Agency (재외동포청; 在外同胞廳)\n\nMinistry of Unification (통일부; 統一部)\n\nMinistry of Justice (법무부; 法務部)\n\nSupreme Prosecutors' Office (검찰청; 檢察廳)\n\nMinistry of National Defense (국방부; 國防部)\n\nMilitary Manpower Administration (병무청; 兵務廳)\n\nDefense Acquisition Program Administration (방위사업청; 防衛事業廳)\n\nMinistry of the Interior and Safety (행정안전부; 行政安全部)\n\nNational Police Agency (경찰청; 警察廳)\n\nNational Fire Agency (소방청; 消防廳)\n\nMinistry of Patriots and Veterans Affairs (국가보훈부; 國家報勳部)\n\nMinistry of Culture, Sports and Tourism (문화체육관광부; 文化體育觀光部)\n\nCultural Heritage Administration (문화재청; 文化財廳)\n\nMinistry of Agriculture, Food and Rural Affairs (농림축산식품부; 農林畜産食品部)\n\nRural Development Administration (농촌진흥청; 農村振興廳)\n\nKorea Forest Service (산림청; 山林廳)\n\nMinistry of Trade, Industry and Energy (산업통상자원부; 産業通商資源部)\n\nKorean Intellectual Property Office (특허청; 特許廳)\n\nMinistry of Health and Welfare (보건복지부; 保健福祉部)\n\nKorea Disease Control and Prevention Agency (질병관리청; 疾病管理廳)\n\nMinistry of Environment (환경부; 環境部)\n\nKorea Meteorological Administration (기상청; 氣象廳)\n\nMinistry of Employment and Labor (고용노동부; 雇用勞動部)\n\nMinistry of Gender Equality and Family (여성가족부; 女性家族部)\n\nMinistry of Land, Infrastructure and Transport (국토교통부; 國土交通部)\n\nNational Agency for Administrative City Construction (행정중심복합도시건설청; 行政中心複合都市建設廳)\n\nSaemangeum Development and Investment Agency (새만금개발청; 새萬金開發廳)[26]\n\nMinistry of Oceans and Fisheries (해양수산부; 海洋水産部)\n\nKorea Coast Guard (해양경찰청; 海洋警察廳)\n\nMinistry of SMEs and Startups (중소벤처기업부; 中小벤처企業部)\n\nDepartment Formed Employees Annual budget Location Minister Minister's Party Ministry of Economy and Finance\n\n기획재정부 February 29, 2008 1,297\n\n(2019) \\21,062 billion\n\n(2019) Sejong Choi Sang-mok Independent Ministry of Education\n\n교육부 March 23, 2013 7,292\n\n(2019) \\74,916 billion\n\n(2019) Sejong Lee Ju-ho Independent Ministry of Science and ICT\n\n과학기술정보통신부 July 26, 2017 35,560\n\n(2019) \\14,946 billion\n\n(2019) Sejong Lee Jong-ho Independent Ministry of Foreign Affairs\n\n외교부 March 23, 2013 656\n\n(2019) \\2,450 billion\n\n(2019) Seoul Cho Tae-yul Independent Ministry of Unification\n\n통일부 March 1, 1969 692\n\n(2019) \\1,326 billion\n\n(2019) Seoul Kim Yung-ho Independent Ministry of Justice\n\n법무부 July 17, 1948 23,135\n\n(2019) \\3,880 billion\n\n(2019) Gwacheon Park Sung-jae Independent Ministry of National Defense\n\n국방부 August 15, 1948 1,095\n\n(2019) \\33,108 billion\n\n(2019) Seoul Shin Won-sik People Power Ministry of the Interior and Safety\n\n행정안전부 July 26, 2017 3,964\n\n(2019) \\55,682 billion\n\n(2019) Sejong Lee Sang-min Independent Ministry of Patriots and Veterans Affairs\n\n국가보훈부 June 5, 2023 337\n\n(2023) \\ billion\n\n(2023) Sejong Kang Jung-ai Independent Ministry of Culture, Sports and Tourism\n\n문화체육관광부 February 29, 2008 2,832\n\n(2019) \\5,923 billion\n\n(2019) Sejong Yu In-chon Independent Ministry of Agriculture, Food and Rural Affairs\n\n농림축산식품부 March 23, 2013 3,706\n\n(2019) \\14,660 billion\n\n(2019) Sejong Song Mi-ryung Independent Ministry of Trade, Industry and Energy\n\n산업통상자원부 February 29, 2008 1,503\n\n(2019) \\7,693 billion\n\n(2019) Sejong Ahn Duk-geun Independent Ministry of Health and Welfare\n\n보건복지부 March 19, 2010 3,637\n\n(2019) \\72,515 billion\n\n(2019) Sejong Cho Kyoo-hong Independent Ministry of Environment\n\n환경부 December 24, 1994 2,534\n\n(2019) \\7,850 billion\n\n(2019) Sejong Han Wha-jin Independent Ministry of Employment and Labor\n\n고용노동부 July 5, 2010 7,552\n\n(2019) \\26,716 billion\n\n(2019) Sejong Lee Jeong-sik Independent Ministry of Gender Equality and Family\n\n여성가족부 March 19, 2010 323\n\n(2019) \\1,047 billion\n\n(2019) Seoul Vacancy Independent Ministry of Land, Infrastructure and Transport\n\n국토교통부 March 23, 2013 4,443\n\n(2019) \\43,219 billion\n\n(2019) Sejong Park Sang-woo Independent Ministry of Oceans and Fisheries\n\n해양수산부 March 23, 2013 3,969\n\n(2019) \\5,180 billion\n\n(2019) Sejong Kang Do-hyung Independent Ministry of SMEs and Startups\n\n중소벤처기업부 July 26, 2017 1,082\n\n(2019) \\10,266 billion\n\n(2019) Sejong Oh Young-ju Independent\n\nIndependent agencies\n\n[edit]\n\nThe following agencies report directly to the President:\n\nOffice of the President(대통령비서실; 大統領秘書室)\n\nOffice of National Security(국가안보실; 國家安保室)\n\nKorea’s Presidential Advisory Body.

This is because the law stipulates that the secretary general of the board, the second highest position in the organization, be the rank of minister and therefore the chairperson, directly over the secretary general in the organization, should be at least the rank of Vice Prime Minister in order to be able to control the whole organization without any power clash.\n\nNational Intelligence Service (국가정보원; 國家情報院)[28]\n\nKorea Communications Commission (방송통신위원회; 放送通信委員會)[29]\n\nThe following councils advise the president on pertinent issues:\n\nNational Security Council (국가안전보장회의; 國家安全保障會議)[30]\n\nNational Unification Advisory Council (민주평화통일자문회의; 民主平和統一諮問會議)[31]\n\nNational Economic Advisory Council (국민경제자문회의; 國民經濟諮問會議)[32]\n\nPresidential Advisory Council on Science and Technology (국가과학기술자문회의; 國家科學技術諮問會議)[33]\n\nThe following agencies report directly to the Prime Minister:\n\nMinistry of Personnel Management (인사혁신처; 人事革新處)[34]\n\nMinistry of Government Legislation (법제처; 法制處)[35]\n\nMinistry of Food and Drug Safety (식품의약품안전처; 食品醫藥品安全處)[36]\n\nFair Trade Commission (공정거래위원회; 公正去來委員會)[37]\n\nAnti-Corruption and Civil Rights Commission (국민권익위원회; 國民權益委員會)[38]\n\nFinancial Services Commission (금융위원회; 金融委員會)[39]\n\nPersonal Information Protection Commission (South Korea) (개인정보보호위원회; 個人情報保護委員會)[40]\n\nNuclear Safety and Security Commission (원자력안전위원회; 原子力安全委員會)[41]\n\nThe Independent Central Administrative Agencies are\n\nCorruption Investigation Office for High-ranking Officials (고위공직자범죄수사처; 高位公職者犯罪搜査處, CIO)[42]\n\nIt is an independent agency for anti-corruption of high-ranking officials in South Korean government, established by 'Act On The Establishment And Operation Of The Corruption Investigation Office For High-ranking Officials'.[42] According to judgment by the Constitutional Court of Korea in 2021, the CIO is officially interpreted as an independent agency inside the executive branch of the South Korean government, which means independence from the Cabinet of South Korea and the Office of the President.[43] By article 3(3) and 17(2) of the Act, CIO's report on the President of South Korea is strictly prohibited, and it only reports to the National Assembly of South Korea.[42]\n\nNational Human Rights Commission of Korea (국가인권위원회; 國家人權委員會, NHRCK)[44] is an independent agency for protecting and promoting human rights in South Korea. Though the NHRCK regards itself as independent from all three branches of the government, it is officially regarded as an independent administrative agency inside the executive branch,[45] according to judgment by the Constitutional Court of Korea in 2010.[46] It burdens duty to report its annul report directly to the President and the National Assembly, by Article 29 of the National Human Rights Commission of Korea Act.[44]\n\nRelocation of government agencies\n\n[edit]\n\nUntil 2013, almost all of the central government agencies were located in either Seoul or Gwacheon government complex, with the exception of a few agencies located in Daejeon government complex. Considering that Gwacheon is a city constructed just outside Seoul to house the new government complex, virtually all administrative functions of South Korea were still concentrated in Seoul. It has been decided, however, that government agencies decide if they will relocate themselves to Sejong Special Self-Governing City, which was created from territory comprising South Chungcheong Province, so that government agencies are better accessible from most parts of South Korea and reduce the concentration of government bureaucracy in Seoul. Since the plan was announced, 22 agencies have moved to the new government complex in Sejong.[19][47][48]\n\nThe following agencies will settle in the Government Complex Seoul:\n\nFinancial Services Commission (금융위원회)\n\nMinistry of Foreign Affairs (외교부)\n\nMinistry of Unification (통일부)\n\nMinistry of Gender Equality and Family (여성가족부)\n\nThe following agencies will settle in Seoul, but in separate locations:\n\nBoard of Audit and Inspection (감사원) will continue to stay in Jongno-gu, Seoul.\n\nNational Intelligence Service (국가정보원) will continue to stay in Seocho-gu, Seoul.\n\nNuclear Safety and Security Commission (원자력안전위원회) will continue to stay in Jongno-gu, Seoul.\n\nNational Security Council (국가안전보장회의) will continue to stay in Jongno-gu, Seoul.\n\nNational Unification Advisory Council (민주평화통일자문회의) will continue to stay in Jung-gu, Seoul.\n\nNational Economic Advisory Council (국민경제자문회의) will continue to stay in Jongno-gu, Seoul.\n\nPresidential Advisory Council on Science and Technology (국가과학기술자문회의) will continue to stay in Jongno-gu, Seoul.\n\nMinistry of National Defense (국방부) will continue to stay in Yongsan-gu, Seoul.\n\nSupreme Prosecutors' Office (검찰청) will continue to stay in Seocho-gu, Seoul.\n\nNational Police Agency (경찰청) will continue to stay in Seodaemun-gu, Seoul.\n\nThe following agencies will settle in Government Complex Gwacheon:\n\nKorea Communications Commission (방송통신위원회)\n\nMinistry of Justice (법무부)\n\nDefense Acquisition Program Administration (방위사업청)\n\nThe following agencies will settle in Government Complex, Daejeon:\n\nKorea Customs Service (관세청)\n\nPublic Procurement Service (조달청)\n\nStatistics Korea (통계청)\n\nMilitary Manpower Administration (병무청)\n\nCultural Heritage Administration (문화재청)\n\nKorea Forest Service (산림청)\n\nKorean Intellectual Property Office (특허청)\n\nKorea Meteorological Administration (기상청)\n\nThe following agencies will settle in Government Complex Sejong:\n\nOffice for Government Policy Coordination, Prime Minister's Secretariat (국무조정실; 국무총리비서실)\n\nMinistry of Personnel Management (인사혁신처)\n\nMinistry of Government Legislation (법제처)\n\nFair Trade Commission (공정거래위원회)\n\nAnti-Corruption and Civil Rights Commission (국민권익위원회)\n\nMinistry of Strategy and Finance (기획재정부)\n\nMinistry of Education (교육부)\n\nMinistry of Science and ICT (과학기술정보통신부)\n\nMinistry of the Interior and Safety (행정안전부)\n\nMinistry of Patriots and Veterans Affairs (국가보훈부)\n\nMinistry of Culture, Sports and Tourism (문화체육관광부)\n\nMinistry of Agriculture, Food and Rural Affairs (농림축산식품부)\n\nMinistry of Trade, Industry and Energy (산업통상자원부)\n\nMinistry of Health and Welfare (보건복지부)\n\nMinistry of Environment (환경부)\n\nMinistry of Employment and Labor (고용노동부)\n\nMinistry of Land, Infrastructure and Transport (국토교통부)\n\nMinistry of Oceans and Fisheries (해양수산부)\n\nMinistry of SMEs and Startups (중소벤처기업부)\n\nNational Tax Service (국세청)\n\nNational Fire Agency (소방청)\n\nMultifunctional Administrative City Construction Agency (행정중심복합도시건설청)\n\nThe following agencies will settle in separate locations:\n\nMinistry of Food and Drug Safety (식품의약품안전처) will continue to stay in Cheongju, North Chungcheong Province.\n\nRural Development Administration (농촌진흥청) will move to Jeonju, North Jeolla Province.\n\nSaemangeum Development and Investment Agency (새만금개발청) will move to Saemangeum development project area.\n\nKorea Coast Guard (해양경찰청) will continue to stay in Songdo, Yeonsu-gu, Incheon Metropolitan City.\n\nJudicial branch\n\n[edit]\n\nMain article: Judiciary of South Korea\n\nThe judicial branch of South Korea is organized into two groups. One is the Constitutional Court which is the highest court on adjudication of matters on constitutionality, including judicial review and constitutional review. Another is ordinary courts on matters except jurisdiction of Constitutional Court. These ordinary courts are regarding the Supreme Court as the highest court. Both the Chief Justice of the Supreme Court and the President of the Constitutional Court have equivalent status as two heads of the judiciary branch in South Korea.\n\nElections\n\n[edit]\n\nMain article: Elections in South Korea\n\nElections in South Korea are held on national level to select the President and the National Assembly. South Korea has a multi-party system, with two dominant parties and numerous third parties. Elections are overseen by the Electoral Branch of the National Election Commission. The most recent presidential election was held on 9 March 2022.\n\nThe president is directly elected for a single five-year term by plurality vote. The National Assembly has 300 members elected for a four-year term, 253 in single-seat constituencies and 47 members by proportional representation. Each individual party intending to represent its policies in the National Assembly must be qualified through the assembly's general election by either: i) the national party-vote reaching over 3.00% on a proportional basis or ii) more than 5 members of their party being elected in each of their first-past-the-post election constituencies.[49]\n\nLocal governments\n\n[edit]\n\nLocal autonomy was established as a constitutional principle of South Korea beginning with the First Republic. However, for much of the 20th century this principle was not honored. From 1965 to 1995, local governments were run directly by provincial governments, which in turn were run directly by the national government. However, since the elections of 1995, a degree of local autonomy has been restored. Local magistrates and assemblies are elected in each of the primary and secondary administrative divisions of South Korea, that is, in every province, metropolitan or special city, and district. Officials at lower levels, such as eup and dong, are appointed by the city or county government.\n\nAs noted above, local autonomy does not extend to the judicial branch. It also does not yet extend to many other areas, including fire protection and education, which are managed by independent national agencies. Local governments also have very limited policy-making authority; generally, the most that they can do is decide how national policies will be implemented. However, there is some political pressure for the scope of local autonomy to be extended.\n\nAlthough the chief executive of each district is locally elected, deputy executives are still appointed by the central government. It is these deputy officials who have detailed authority over most administrative matters.\n\nCivil service\n\n[edit]\n\nThe South Korean civil service is managed by the Ministry of Personnel Management. This is large, and remains a largely closed system, although efforts at openness and reform are ongoing. In order to gain a position in civil service, it is usually necessary to pass one or more difficult examinations. Positions have traditionally been handed out based on seniority, in a complex graded system; however, this system was substantially reformed in 1998.\n\nThere are more than 800,000 civil servants in South Korea today. More than half of these are employed by the central government; only about 300,000 are employed by local governments. In addition, only a few thousand each are employed by the national legislative and judicial branches; the overwhelming majority are employed in the various ministries of the executive branch. The size of the civil service increased steadily from the 1950s to the late 1990s, but has dropped slightly since 1995\n\nThe civil service, not including political appointees and elected officials, is composed of career civil servants and contract civil servants. Contract servants are typically paid higher wages and hired for specific jobs. Career civil servants make up the bulk of the civil service, and are arranged in a nine-tiered system in which grade 1 is occupied by assistant ministers and grade 9 by the newest and lowest-level employees. Promotions are decided by a combination of seniority, training, and performance review. Civil servants' base salary makes up less than half of their annual pay; the remainder is supplied in a complex system of bonuses. Contract civil servants are paid on the basis of the competitive rates of pay in the private sector.[citation needed]\n\nSymbols\n\n[edit]\n\nEmblem of the Government of South Korea (1949–2016)\n\nFlag of the Government of South Korea (1949–2016)\n\nThe taegeuk symbol used by government and its institutions (from 2016)\n\nFlag of the Government of South Korea from 2016, some other governmental institutions uses the flag in the same pattern.\n\nSee also\n\n[edit]\n\nSouth Korea portal\n\nGovernment of North Korea\n\nPolitics of South Korea\n\nNational Assembly\n\nJudiciary of South Korea\n\nCabinet of South Korea\n\nOrders, decorations, and medals of South Korea\n\nReferences\n\n[edit]\n\nFurther reading\n\n[edit]\n\nKorea Overseas Information Service (2003).
