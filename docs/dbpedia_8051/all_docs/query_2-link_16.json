        "text": "Despite government anticorruption efforts, including investigations and prosecutions, practices such as bribery, influence peddling, and extortion persist. The 2016 Improper Solicitation and Graft Act establishes stiff punishments for those convicted of accepting bribes, and applies to government officials and their spouses, as well as to journalists and educators. The Corruption Investigation Office for High-Ranking Officials (CIO) investigates corruption allegations against public officials and can unilaterally indict police officers, prosecutors, and judges. Conflict-of-interest legislation for public servants took effect in 2022.\n\nIn June 2023, the Board of Audit and Inspection (BAI) began an audit of the NEC over reportedly nepotistic hires after the organization initially refused to allow an inspection. In September, the Anti-Corruption and Civil Rights Commission (ACRC) began an inspection of all lawmakers’ assets following the passage of legislation in May that requires government officials and lawmakers to declare their virtual assets.\n\nIn 2022, officials appointed during the Moon administration came under scrutiny over allegations that the administration had manipulated economic data, and a September 2023 BAI audit revealed economic “data manipulation.” Multiple National Assembly members resigned in 2023 due to allegations of corruption, and First Lady Kim Keon-hee was investigated for allegedly manipulating stock prices.\n\nThe media environment is generally free and competitive, and the media reports aggressively on government policies and allegations of official and corporate wrongdoing. However, a defamation law authorizes prison sentences or fines, encouraging some self-censorship, and journalists have faced political interference from employers and government officials.\n\nThe Yoon administration has signaled that criticism of its activities and allegations that it has a left-wing bias could prompt retaliation and the number of defamation cases it has filed has risen. In 2022, the PPP filed a defamation suit against the Munhwa Broadcasting Corporation (MBC) for publishing a video of President Yoon apparently cursing while speaking to aide after meeting with US president Joseph R. Biden. In May 2023, the apartment of the journalist who reported on the video of President Yoon was raided on charges that he had of leaked the personal information of the minister of justice. Also in 2023, two media outlets—Newstapa and the Joongang Tongyang Broadcasting Company (JTBC)—were raided over their reporting on election interference, which implicated President Yoon. Journalists and foreign reporters have repeatedly been denied access to presidential media briefings and events since Yoon’s election.\n\nAccess to North Korean media is restricted. News coverage or commentary deemed to favor Pyongyang can be censored and lead to prosecution under the NSL. In 2022, the Unification Ministry published a report recommending that restrictions be loosened, but no changes were made in 2023.\n\nThe Korea Communications Standards Commission (KCSC) evaluates online content and blocks or deletes material according to vaguely defined standards; most of the affected content is reportedly related to illegal sex work, pornography, gambling, promotion of illegitimate food and medicine, or other criminal activity. In September 2023, the Korean Communications Commission proposed a “one strike” policy to counter outlets that report false information; the policy was criticized by observers as unconstitutional.\n\nIn 2022, prosecutors raided the offices of the country’s broadcasting regulator, the KCC, over concerns that it manipulated the broadcast-renewal process for two television outlets in 2020. KCC Chairman Han Sang-hyuk was indicted in May 2023.\n\nPrivate discussion is typically free and open, and the government generally respects citizens’ right to privacy. However, the government’s capacity for surveillance remains robust. An antiterrorism law grants the NIS expansive authority to monitor private communications. The NIS, police, prosecutors, and investigative agencies can also access metadata without a warrant; this includes internet users’ national identification numbers, postal addresses, and telephone numbers.\n\nThe NSL restricts speech that is considered pro–North Korean. In 2022, the Constitutional Court reviewed the constitutionality of Articles 2 and 7 of the NSL, which define and punish “antistate” organizations and proscribe the production or possession of material considered rebellious. The court ruled that the articles were constitutional in September 2023. In November, the ruling supported the sentencing of a man convicted of writing a pro–North Korea poem in 2016.\n\nWorkers have the right to form independent unions and engage in strikes and collective bargaining. The country’s independent labor unions advocate for workers’ interests in practice, organizing high-profile strikes and demonstrations that sometimes lead to arrests. However, labor unions have diminished in strength as more South Koreans work on a temporary or part-time basis. Workplaces with fewer than 30 employees are not obligated to establish or operate collective agreements, and major employers sometimes engage in antiunion activity.\n\nMany unions held strikes in 2023 in response to proposed job cuts or changes to work hours and overtime rules. In July, members of KMWU, including those from the automobile industry, joined a nationwide strike by the KCTU to protest the government’s labor policies and demand better wages, causing disruptions in the country’s manufacturing sector. In October, public sector workers staged a major nationwide walkout to demand better wages and working conditions.\n\nThe Korean Teachers and Education Workers Union (KTU) held rallies in response to the mistreatment of teachers in 2023; however, public school teachers are barred from taking collective action or striking.\n\nIn 2023, the NIS raided the offices of the KCTU because of suspected “ties with North Korea.”\n\nJudges render verdicts in all cases. While there is no trial by jury, an advisory jury system has been in place since 2008, and judges largely respect juries’ decisions. Ordinary legal proceedings are generally considered fair, but the courts have sometimes been accused of denying due process and impartiality to defendants in NSL cases.\n\nIn 2022, the National Assembly passed amendments to the Prosecutors’ Office Act and the Criminal Procedure Act that would limit prosecutors’ ability to directly conduct investigations. Despite petitions from the Justice Ministry and the Yoon administration, in March 2023 the amendments were found not to violate prosecutors’ authority.\n\nIn August 2023, President Yoon pardoned over 2,100 individuals, including prominent chaebol leaders, with the aim of stimulating the economy.\n\nViolent crime is relatively rare, but the country remains at war with North Korea, resulting in a heavy military presence in some areas and the constant threat of renewed combat. Minor incidents of violence near the de facto border are not uncommon. In December, a BAI audit reported that the Moon administration concealed information related to the death of a South Korean fishery official at the hands of North Korean soldiers in 2020.\n\nIn 2023, 23 officials were charged with negligence and involuntary manslaughter related to the October 2022 Itaewon crowd crush, in which nearly 160 people died.\n\nReports of abuse by prison guards are infrequent. Prison conditions generally meet international standards.\n\nSouth Korea lacks a comprehensive antidiscrimination law. Members of the country’s small non-Korean population face legal and societal discrimination, including forced repatriation. Children of foreign-born residents and single foreign parents are systematically excluded from education and medical systems, and estimates place the number of unregistered foreign children at up to 20,000.\n\nApproximately 34,000 North Korean defectors have entered South Korea since 1998. While the government aims to socially integrate defectors, they can face months of detention and questioning upon arrival. Some defectors have reported abuse in custody and societal discrimination. In February 2023, four South Korean officials were indicted for allegedly mishandling the repatriation of two North Korean fishermen in 2019.\n\nNorth Korean defectors need not apply for asylum using the same process as other applicants. Those from other countries are far more likely to have their claims rejected or mishandled by immigration officials; since 2019 the country has recognized less than three percent of asylum seekers as refugees each year.\n\nWomen generally enjoy legal equality but face significant social and employment discrimination; when compared to men, they enjoy a lower employment rate and suffer the largest pay gap among OECD countries. In August 2023, the Shinhan Card company was found guilty of purposely giving women’s applications lower scores in order to hire more men. In November, the Labor Ministry announced plans to investigate workplace gender discrimination.\n\nSexual harassment of women, including in the workplace, is common; a number of political figures have been accused as part of the #MeToo movement. In June 2023, National Police Agency data showed that in 2022, sexual crimes had rebounded to pre-pandemic levels.\n\nExisting legislation bars discrimination based on sexual orientation but lacks specific penalties for violations. Transgender people are not explicitly protected and interpretations of gender identity are “left up to courts” on a case-by-case basis. In a survey released by Dawoom, an LGBT+ rights NGO, in May 2022, 67 percent of transgender respondents said they had experienced discrimination in the previous year.\n\nWhile protections against exploitative working conditions are enforced, foreign migrant workers remain vulnerable to illegal debt bondage and forced labor, including sex trafficking. In 2023, the government considered a pilot program to help address the country’s low birthrate by allowing domestic workers from Southeast Asia into the country to work for parents, prompting concerns of exploitation. Migrant workers’ groups have denounced the employment permit system and legislation that makes it difficult for individuals to change their employment, which can expose workers to abuses and mental health-related issues.\n\nDelivery workers, some of whom have died from overwork, typically lack the labor protections offered to full-time employees.\n\nWomen in South Korea are vulnerable to recruitment by international marriage brokers and sex traffickers. Many foreign women who have suffered sexual violence face language barriers and are reluctant to come forward due to their employment status. Although the government actively prosecutes human trafficking cases, those convicted often receive light punishments. In its Trafficking in Persons Report 2023, the US State Department noted that authorities “did not report identifying any” forced labor or trafficking victims despite numerous reports."
