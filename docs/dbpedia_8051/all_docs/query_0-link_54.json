        "text": "The period under review was shaped by two major developments. The first half of the review period continued to be dominated by responses to the COVID-19 pandemic, while the presidential election in March 2022 and the subsequent change in government dominated the second half of the review period.\n\nThe Republic of Korea (South Korea) performed comparatively well during the COVID-19 pandemic. This relative success can be attributed to a combination of factors. First, South Korea has relatively few ports of entry, making it easier to restrict international travel. Second, quarantine rules were strictly enforced. Third, South Koreans are accustomed to wearing masks, particularly in response to fine dust pollution and the 2015 outbreak of the MERS virus. In general, Koreans are also willing to follow government guidelines, even if the guidelines are not legally binding. Fourth, the health care sector in South Korea is relatively well-developed and universal health insurance ensures that all those who become sick receive treatment. Fifth, although the COVID-19 vaccination campaign began slowly, it ultimately proved highly successful. With an 86% vaccination rate, South Korea now ranks among the highest in the world. Sixth, due to the absence of a complete lockdown and the government’s swift adoption of a large stimulus package, the economic consequences of the COVID-19 crisis were relatively small compared to other countries. However, the full social costs of the crisis remain unknown. Since South Korea has a significant portion of irregular, precarious and self-employed workers, the true social costs of the crisis are only likely to emerge in the coming years. In terms of structure, the South Korean economy was well-positioned to meet the surging demand for IT products during the COVID-19 crisis, although its heavy reliance on fossil fuels remains a vulnerability.\n\nDespite South Korea’s reliance on fossil fuels, however, the effects of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine and the subsequent increase in energy prices on consumers have so far been limited. While overall inflation in South Korea has increased and interest rates have risen, the effects are less severe than in other countries for two main reasons. First, the majority of the gas and oil used in South Korea is sourced from the Middle East and the United States. Only approximately 5% of the gas and 6% of the oil comes from Russia, and all the gas is delivered through flexible LNG terminals rather than pipelines. In fact, South Korea is a leading player in the transportation and processing of LNG. Second, the energy sector in South Korea is mainly controlled by state-owned companies that have absorbed some of the increase in global market prices, partially shielding consumers. However, a downside to this approach is that energy conservation has been a very low priority for both consumers and the government.\n\nIn March 2022, South Korea elected a new conservative president, Yoon Suk-yeol. Yoon gained popularity as a prosecutor when he stood up against former conservative President Park and the more liberal President Moon. As a political outsider, Yoon relies heavily on staff and experts who served under previous administrations, particularly the conservative Lee Myung-bak administration. Politically, President Yoon is strongly conservative and pro-business. He claims to want to reduce state interventions, regulations and the corporate tax rate. He is particularly harsh in his critique of labor unions, and the previous administration’s reduction of the maximum weekly working hours and increase in the national minimum wage. At the same time, he represents a generational change in the Conservative Party. The old generation, which retains a strong connection to the country’s dictatorship and refuses to acknowledge the historical role of the democracy movement, is gradually retiring.\n\nAs his Conservative Party lacks a parliamentary majority, President Yoon will face significant challenges in implementing major reforms. Furthermore, given the constitution’s strict limit of a single five-year presidential term, he must navigate negotiations and seek compromises, or rely on winning the 2024 parliamentary elections to advance his agenda. Yoon’s domestic reform agenda will undoubtedly encounter strong resistance from the Democratic Party majority in the parliament, yet he has already shifted away from the previous administration’s foreign policies. While the Moon administration (unsuccessfully) pursued relations with North Korea, Yoon has adopted a more confrontational stance and pledged to strengthen ties with the United States, South Korea’s key ally, as well as with Japan. Particularly in relation to Japan, where relations reached an all-time low under the previous administration, the contentious issue of Japan’s colonial occupation of South Korea looms large. In the wake of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, although not a pressing concern for South Korea, both administrations have condemned the attack and, albeit reluctantly at first, supported international sanctions. On the critical issue of climate change, President Yoon, much like his predecessor, has shown little enthusiasm. While the long-term goal of achieving net-zero carbon emissions by 2050 remains intact, the administration’s short- to medium-term goals fall short of expectations. Under the Paris Agreement, the binding, nationally determined contributions commit to a mere 24.4% reduction by 2030 compared to 2017 levels. With over four years left in office, Yoon’s concrete political agenda remains ambiguous and awaits clarification.\n\nThe Republic of Korea (South Korea) has been very successful in economic development since the 1960s and in democratization since the 1980s. The foundations of successful economic development, as well as the causes of many economic, social and political challenges, can be found in the authoritarian regimes of President Park Chung-hee (1961 – 1979) and President Chun Doo-hwan (1980 – 1988), both former generals. Socioeconomic modernization facilitated democratic change in the late 1980s, and, after decades of struggle against Japanese colonialism and authoritarian rule, South Koreans successfully overthrew the military dictatorship in 1987. Nevertheless, the military-backed political party under General Roh Tae-woo won the presidential race in the first elections held in December 1987. In the 1993 elections, Kim Young-sam formed a coalition with the ruling party and was the first civilian elected president after three decades of military dominance in politics. During his term (1993 – 1998), democratic reforms continued, including in the areas of civil-military relations, electoral politics and the judicial system. The election of former dissident Kim Dae-jung as president in December 1997 marked a significant milestone, demonstrating that all relevant forces had been integrated into the political system. Kim Dae-jung is given particular credit for managing the successful recovery from the Asian financial crisis (1997 – 1998) and engaging with North Korea as part of his Sunshine Policy. In 2003, former labor lawyer Roh Moo-hyun became president. Roh tried to deepen democracy by strengthening human rights, improving civil society participation, and reforming deeply conservative institutions such as the judiciary and education system. He also continued the process of economic liberalization, negotiating controversial preferential trade agreements with the United States and the European Union. Ultimately, Roh failed to deliver on many of his promises and was criticized for presiding over declining growth rates and increasing inequality. In 2007, the conservative Lee Myung-bak, a former CEO of a construction company turned mayor of Seoul, easily won the presidential election by promising a return to high growth rates. After 10 years of progressive rule, a new chapter in South Korea’s democratic development was opened with the return to a conservative government. During his tenure, Lee was criticized for his top-down approach, and restrictions on the press and freedom of expression. While he has been credited with managing the global financial crisis (2007 – 2008) relatively well, he was also criticized for his one-sided support of big business and the controversial Four Rivers project. In December 2012, the conservative Park Geun-hye, daughter of former President Park Chung-hee, was elected president on a platform of economic democratization and welfare. However, she failed to deliver on her promises. In addition, she was criticized for her authoritarian governing style, botched staff appointments and human rights infringements. After several top-level corruption scandals led to massive street protests, President Park was impeached by the parliament in 2016, and the current president, Moon Jae-in, was elected in May 2017. Both former presidents, Park and Lee, are serving long prison sentences for corruption. President Moon of former President Roh’s Democratic Party won the election following Park’s impeachment, constituting the second loss of power by the Conservative Party since the election of Kim Dae-jung in 1997. While the Moon administration successfully managed the COVID-19 crisis, the administration will also be remembered for its unsuccessful engagement policies with North Korea, and the missed opportunities to achieve more comprehensive social and liberal reforms, despite the historic opportunity presented by the Democratic Party’s parliamentary majority.\n\nEconomically, South Korea’s transformation from a protectionist and state-directed developmental state to a more open and market-oriented economy is progressing slowly. Both the legacy of the developmental state and the state’s close relationship with big business conglomerates (chaebol) remain strong and continue to shape the South Korean economy. Significant strides toward liberalization were taken in the 1980s, early 1990s and after the Asian financial crisis. Policymakers followed a sequence of measures promoting industrialization and global market integration. This involved strategic planning, government guidance of domestic economic actors, and a selective approach to foreign direct investment and imports, all of which constituted key elements in the state-led industrialization policy implemented from the 1960s onward. A legacy of South Korea’s late and “condensed” industrialization persists in the influential position of chaebols, which have dominated economic activity ever since the 1970s and continue to impede competition.\n\nIn its foreign relations, South Korea has focused on its main adversary, North Korea, along with the strong military presence of its main ally, the United States. Historically, South Korea has been a rather inward-looking country. However, over the last two decades, it has become increasingly involved in global and regional international institutions, such as the United Nations, World Trade Organization (WTO), G-20, OECD, RCEP and the ASEAN Plus Three process.\n\nElections at the national, regional and local levels are held in a free and transparent manner. The extent of money-driven politics at election times has declined substantially in recent years. Accusations of and investigations into illicit campaign financing are often used as a means of questioning or undermining the reputation of potential political candidates.\n\nAll electoral affairs are managed in a free and transparent manner by the National Election Commission (NEC), an independent constitutional organ. The controversial National Security Law bans parties that are “pro-North Korean.” In December 2014, the Constitutional Court ruled that the United Progressive Party was to be disbanded, as its pro-North Korean stance violated this law.\n\nThe opaque character of South Korean election law concerning allowable support for candidates during the election period, which can last for up to 180 days before an election, represents an electoral gray area. According to some interpretations of Article 93 of the election law, all public expressions of support for candidates or parties are illegal during this period unless one is registered as an official campaigner. This can be seen as a disadvantage for smaller candidates who lack their prominent rivals’ access to traditional media. In general, small parties have a difficult time gaining coverage in the mainstream media.\n\nSocial media is changing this landscape. On the one hand, it is an influential and equalizing means of public communication for all candidates and parties. On the other hand, social media is being used to illicitly interfere in elections. In 2017, the Korean National Intelligence Service (NIS) was found guilty of using social media to support President Park’s election in 2012. In 2018, the Democratic Party (DP) expelled two of its members for online opinion-rigging that aimed to benefit Moon Jae-in during the 2017 election. DP insiders were again accused of online opinion-rigging during the 2022 presidential election.\n\nSouth Korea’s March 2022 presidential and June 2022 local elections are widely acknowledged to have been successfully, fairly and safely administered. That said, the presidential election was not only the tightest election in South Korea’s history but was also marred by mudslinging and politically motivated investigations, which skirt the line of “fair” election practices. Regarding parliamentary elections, South Korea’s first-past-the-post system decisively advantages large, established parties. Originally, an election reform in 2019 aimed at compensating smaller parties for the disadvantage. However, in practice, the reform worsened the situation because – in a legally dubious move – former members of major parties created satellite parties to benefit from the new election system. Further reform of the electoral system is needed to better align voters’ preferences with the allocation of representative seats.\n\nThe freedoms of association and assembly are guaranteed and, in principle, respected, although some major problems remain. The National Security Law is considered one of the main obstacles to freedom of expression, association and assembly, as it authorizes the National Intelligence Service (NIS) to penalize individuals and ban organizations if they are deemed to be “pro-North Korea.” The very loose definition of pro-North Korea poses a persistent risk that it could be misused to suppress opposition to government policies.\n\nDemonstrations in South Korea require prior approval, which can be hard to obtain. In practice, many demonstrations are declared illegal, sometimes due to minor issues such as the obstruction of traffic. The need to contain COVID-19 led to some restrictions, and bans on public demonstrations and other gatherings (e.g., church services) were even imposed during the review period. Several groups, particularly those on the right of the political spectrum, accused the government of using public health as a pretext to ban anti-government demonstrations.\n\nLabor unions continue to face considerable challenges when organizing, including legal constraints on their freedom to engage in political activities. For example, businesses can sue labor unions, seeking compensation for “lost profits” during strikes. Labor unions gained some ground under the Moon administration. In 2018 and 2019, respectively, the Korean Government Employees Union (KGEU) and the Korean Teachers and Education Workers Union (KTU) were reinstated after losing their official status for allowing dismissed employees to retain their memberships. In December 2020, the National Assembly passed several major revisions to labor laws. These revisions included strengthening protections related to irregular work, industrial accidents, trade unions (dismissed and unemployed workers are guaranteed the right to union membership) and strikes (removing the ban on strikes at manufacturing facilities). This set the stage for the Moon administration to ratify three of the four outstanding ILO conventions: no. 87 (on freedom of association), no. 98 (on the right to organize and collective bargaining) and no. 29 (on the prohibition of forced labor). The bill ratifying Convention 105 (Abolition of Forced Labor) was withdrawn due to unresolved conflicts with domestic laws regarding prison labor.\n\nLabor unions are likely to lose ground under the pro-business Yoon administration. The Yoon administration took a hard-line approach to the June and November 2022 truck drivers’ union strikes, which demanded minimum freight rates, labeling the strikes “illegal.” In September 2022, President Yoon and his People Power Party (PPP) came out against a set of bills proposed by progressive lawmakers that would limit the ability of companies to seek strike-related compensation. In December 2022, PPP lawmakers proposed a set of bills that would tighten auditing and accounting requirements for labor unions. Both the more progressive KCTU and conservative FKTU (the two largest umbrella labor unions in South Korea) have criticized Yoon’s labor union reform efforts, with FKTU raising concerns that Yoon’s tactics signal a “return to politics of force, using the knife of the investigative authorities.”\n\nOn a more positive note, in 2020, the National Assembly stripped the NIS of its authority to conduct criminal investigations into violations of the National Security Law (effective 2024). In 2022, the incoming Yoon administration also announced that it would decriminalize access to North Korean media. However, it remains to be seen if this will entail a further loosening of the National Security Law.\n\nOverall, South Korea maintained its position as one of the few successful democracies in East Asia. It led the region’s rankings in the areas of press freedom and liberal democracy. Indeed, it was the only Asian country ranked in the top 10% of the 2022 V-Dem Liberal Democracy Index, and its liberal democracy score was higher than more than half of OECD members. In general, the frequency of state infringements on political rights declined under the Moon administration. Meanwhile, the Yoon administration has been vocal about its commitment to freedom and liberal democracy, though its treatment of the press has so far raised red flags (see Q2.4 Freedom of expression).\n\nThe freedoms of expression, press, science and art are constitutionally guaranteed. They are generally respected in practice, but there are some infringements. Reporters Without Borders, for example, has criticized the politically affiliated process through which managers at public broadcasters are appointed. Major media outlets are politically biased – with the largest and longest-running outlets aligned with conservative parties.\n\nAnother major restriction is the National Security Law’s (NSL) criminalization of pro-North Korea speech and activity (real or perceived). North Korean TV and radio programs are actively blocked, and North Korean newspapers are not permitted to be sold in South Korea. However, the new Yoon administration announced in 2022 that it would decriminalize access to North Korean media. The NSL has been used to prosecute individuals who advocate for positions that are seen to favor communist North Korea. The NSL has also led to a degree of self-censorship among the media and other actors.\n\nFurthermore, South Korea has very problematic anti-defamation laws that punish defamation (even in the case of true statements) with harsh prison terms if they are not seen as being in “the public interest.” Defamation suits are frequently filed as a means of preventing critical questions from journalists or civil society and of muting political opposition.\n\nHaving learned from the MERS outbreak – during which fake news spread rapidly – South Korea has been relatively successful at providing accurate, credible, and timely information via the Korea Centers for Disease Control’s Office of Risk Communication. There was little politicization of official COVID-19 information by the media, and KCDC data seems highly regarded as trustworthy, neutral, and evidence-based. It remains a concern that laws against fake news and the extensive interpretation of defamation in South Korea, which includes truthful statements, limit press freedoms and encourage self-censorship.\n\nUnder the progressive Moon administration, South Korea significantly improved press and internet freedoms. Reporters Without Borders ranked South Korea 43rd out of 180 countries in 2021, the highest score among Asian countries. This was a vast improvement from its all-time low ranking of 69th and 70th during the conservative Lee Myeong-bak and Park Geun-hye administrations.\n\nSome are concerned that Yoon will follow his fellow conservatives (Lee and Park) in rolling back press freedoms. Since his inauguration in May 2022, Yoon has been accused of sidelining “leftist” media outlets, for example, by not affording them equal access to presidential briefings and, in one instance, barring a media outlet (MBC) from the presidential plane. More worryingly, the Yoon administration has used “protection of the national interest” as a justification for retaliating against media outlets. For example, the Yoon administration has accused MBC of disseminating fake news and harming the national interest by reporting that Yoon had been overheard using offensive language during an official international event. The International Federation of Journalists has expressed concerns over the presidential office’s treatment of MBC, saying that this sets “a dangerous precedent.” Violent threats against MBC journalists have ensued. This led to a joint statement by the Korea Broadcasting Journalist Association, National Union of Media Workers, Journalists Association of Korea, Korea Producers and Directors Association, Korea Video Journalist Association, and Korea Broadcasting Engineers and Technicians Association, among other groups. In the statement, they expressed concern that the Yoon administration’s “continued attacks to suppress the media” incited “threats of terrorism and murder against a journalist by [the administration’s] extremist supporters.” The joint statement even likened Yoon’s tactics to Russia’s “mobilization of regime supporters as a means to tame critical media.”\n\nSouth Korea has open government and freedom of information laws and institutions in place. However, public institutions are not very proactive in providing information.\n\nThere is a clear separation of powers with mutual checks and balances. South Korea’s constitution grants substantial powers to the executive in general and the president in particular. Most observers agree that the South Korean presidential system is a paradigmatic example of an “imperial presidency,” at least during times when the party of the president has the majority in the unicameral South Korean parliament.\n\nThe judiciary is generally able to check the power of the executive, and the Constitutional Court in particular has earned some reputation for its independence. However, many experts call for additional reforms to decentralize power away from the “imperial presidency.” Notable reform proposals include strengthening the role of the prime minister, introducing a limit of two four-year presidential terms instead of the current single five-year term limit and/or restricting the constitutional powers of the president.\n\nThroughout his tenure, President Moon took steps to strengthen the rule of law, including by “completely separat[ing] powerful institutions from domestic politics and install[ing] systems to make any such institutions unable to wield omnipotent power.” In December 2020, the National Assembly adopted three legislative reforms to this effect. These included a major reform of police law that introduces a local autonomous police system and allows for the establishment of a national investigation office; a revision of the National Intelligence Service Act, which strips the National Intelligence Service of its authority to conduct criminal investigations into violations of the National Security Law; and the introduction of a bill establishing the new Corruption Investigation Office for High-ranking Officials (CIO).\n\nThe establishment of the CIO was part of Moon’s efforts to check the power of the Supreme Prosecutor’s Office, while also preventing it from interfering in politics. Prosecutors in South Korea lead the investigation of criminal cases and have considerable flexibility in deciding whether to prosecute a suspect or not. Unlike judges, prosecutors are not independent, and there have been cases in which they have used their power to harass political opponents. Typically, prosecutors appear more reluctant to investigate acting government officials (with whom they are politically aligned) than the representatives of previous governments. Under President Yoon – who fought Moon’s prosecutorial reform efforts in his former capacity as prosecutor general – the minister of justice has reinstated investigative powers that were stripped from the Prosecutor’s Office. Meanwhile, the fate of the CIO, which was intended to be independent from the Prosecutor’s Office, remains to be seen.\n\nThe South Korean judiciary is highly professionalized and independent, though not completely free from governmental pressure. In particular, since its establishment in 1989, the Constitutional Court has become a very effective guardian of the constitution.\n\nUnder South Korea’s version of centralized constitutional review, the Constitutional Court is the only body with the power to declare a legal norm unconstitutional. The Supreme Court, on the other hand, is responsible for reviewing ministerial and government decrees. However, there have been cases in the past where the Supreme Court sought the authority to adjudicate on the constitutionality of acts that had minimal connection to ministerial or government decrees. This has interfered with the Constitutional Court’s authority, which has contributed to several legal battles between the Constitutional Court and Supreme Court. On the whole, the Constitutional Court has become an effective guardian of the constitution, although it has been relatively weak on anti-discrimination issues and defending political liberties relating to the security threat posed by North Korea. One development to follow is the Constitutional Court’s review of the constitutionality of the National Security Law, which began in September 2022 in response to 11 petitions lodged by individuals and district courts.\n\nFollowing the civil law tradition, prosecutors in South Korea are not independent. Instead, prosecutors are civil servants who are hierarchically organized and prone to political influence. Efforts to reform the Prosecutor’s Office dominated the justice sector throughout the Moon regime. Two justice ministers (Cho Kuk and Choo Mi-ae) during the Moon administration unsuccessfully pursued this priority. Having been chosen expressly to lead this reform, former Justice Minister Cho was forced to resign after only a few weeks in office after the Supreme Prosecutor’s Office turned the table and charged several members of Cho’s family with corrupt and illicit activities. His replacement, Minister Choo, resigned after failing to remove Prosecutor General Yoon Suk-yeol from office for fraud, bribery and other corrupt activities.\n\nMoon’s key prosecutorial reform successes were to move some investigative authorities to the police, and to establish the new Corruption Investigation Office (CIO) to investigate and prosecute high-ranking officials. The Yoon administration has reversed the former reform, and it is likely to dissolve or weaken the CIO in favor of the Prosecutor’s Office.\n\nBasic civil rights are protected by the constitution. Courts have been reasonably effective in protecting civil rights, and a Human Rights Commission was established in 2001. The Korean Supreme Court accepted “conscience or religious beliefs” in 2018, and the government is slowly starting to offer a civil-service alternative for conscientious objectors to military service. A moratorium on executions announced in 1998 remains in place, although attempts to completely abolish the death penalty in the parliament and the Constitutional Court have thus far failed. In April 2019, the Constitutional Court strengthened women’s rights, ruling that South Korea’s 65-year ban on abortion was unconstitutional. In October 2021, stronger workplace harassment penalties were adopted, and beginning in 2022 employees will for the first time be able to petition the Labor Relations Commission for relief and damages in gender discrimination and sexual harassment cases.\n\nDespite the constitutional provision that “there shall be no discrimination in political, economic, social or cultural life on account of sex, religion or social status” and the relatively effective performance of the courts in protecting these civil rights, South Korea’s lack of a comprehensive anti-discrimination law remains an obstacle to realizing these constitutional rights. In fact, discrimination remains a major problem in South Korea for groups as diverse as women, migrants, people with disabilities, LGBTQ+ people and North Korean defectors.\n\nWomen are still underrepresented in the labor market, comprising only 43% of the labor force, despite having an average education level similar to that of men. The Global Gender Gap Index for 2021 ranks South Korea 102nd out of 156 countries evaluated. The gender pay gap remains the largest in the OECD, and the COVID-19 shock disproportionately affected female workers, as they outnumber men in the service sector and in irregular jobs, the areas most affected by the pandemic. In terms of leadership positions, the proportion of women in managerial positions in state-funded and large private companies was 19.8% in 2019, while 19% of National Assembly seats are held by women, both rates below the global average. Gender equality advocates are concerned that women will lose further ground under the Yoon administration. Yoon’s campaign included appeals to anti-feminist male voters. Yoon denies that there is systemic gender discrimination in South Korea, blames feminism for South Korea’s low birthrate and, in October 2022 (as promised during his campaign), announced the dissolution of the Ministry of Gender Equality and Family.\n\nDiscrimination against irregular workers, North Korean defectors and ethnic Koreans from other countries (principally China) remains widespread. According to a study by the National Human Rights Commission of Korea, half of North Korean defectors in South Korea have suffered from discrimination. Discrimination against migrants intensified during COVID-19, as migrants were excluded from disaster relief payments and services (e.g., the provision of subsidized masks) that the government extended to all South Korean nationals. These groups are particularly vulnerable to discrimination and abuse in the workplace. Advocates have called on the South Korean government to ratify ILO Convention No. 190 on ending workplace harassment and violence.\n\nWhile courts have strengthened some rights for the LGBTQ+ community, the government has failed to take decisive action to reduce systemic discrimination. In April 2022, the Supreme Court overturned the convictions of two men who had been prosecuted under Article 92-6. This decision set a positive precedent for protecting homosexuals serving in the military, while the courts continue to review the overall constitutionality of Article 92-6 of the Military Penal Code, which criminalizes sexual relations between members of the same sex within the armed forces. On the other hand, in January 2022, a Seoul court ruled against a homosexual couple who had sought spousal health insurance benefits.\n\nFor the 11th time since 2007, the National Assembly is considering a comprehensive anti-discrimination law that would prohibit discrimination based on gender, disability, medical history, age, origin, ethnicity, race, skin color, physical condition, marital status, sexual orientation and gender identity. Despite widespread public support for such a law and the backing of then-President Moon, the National Assembly Legislation and Judiciary Committee had not completed its review by the original November 2021 deadline. It has extended the review period to May 2024.\n\nSouth Korea’s democratic institutions are generally effective, though the impeachment of President Park has raised questions whether the massive power held by the president undermines the performance of government overall, as policy framing and implementation depend on a strong and capable president.\n\nFor example, during the COVID-19 pandemic, the centralized system meant that South Korea could react swiftly in the initial phases. Regular meetings of the Central Disaster and Safety Countermeasures Headquarters (CDSCHQ) meetings, which brought together representatives of all relevant ministries, and 17 provinces and major cities, were held to ensure a cohesive national approach to combating the spread of COVID-19. These meetings facilitated regular coordination among high-ranking officials from central and local governments, which was crucial for identifying problems, overcoming obstacles and devising solutions. The regular meetings supported a concerted implementation process and the effective allocation of central government resources, enabling rapid local adaptation to changing circumstances when necessary. Attesting to the strength of the system, there were no relevant COVID-19-related basic public service disruptions. Since the beginning of the pandemic, the government has mobilized public administration effectively to ensure testing, tracing and quarantine policies were enforced. While COVID-19 necessitated emergency measures (e.g., the temporary suspension of personal data privacy and association rights), these have been implemented in accordance with relevant laws and by the appropriate, designated authorities. The executive and other branches of government have functioned effectively and within their designated authority.\n\nAt the same time, the hierarchical structure became problematic in areas where President Moon showed little leadership, such as the rollout of vaccinations. More recently, concerns have been raised that the Itaewon crowd disaster (during which more than 150 people died) could have been avoided or mitigated if police trained in crowd control had been deployed to Itaewon rather than to an anti-government protest as directed by the Yoon administration.\n\nExecutive power is concentrated in the president’s hands. South Korea’s constitution grants substantial powers to the executive in general and the president in particular. Most observers agree that the South Korean presidential system is a paradigmatic example of an “imperial presidency.” The president has the authority to and often does rearrange, merge and abolish ministries according to his or her agenda. For example, President Moon created the Ministry of SMEs and Startups; renamed the Ministry of Science, ICT and Future Planning as the Ministry of Science and ICT; and merged the National Security Agency and the Ministry of Public Administration and Security to form the Ministry of the Interior and Safety. President Yoon dissolved the Ministry of Gender Equality and Family. That said, South Korean staff within bureaucracies are highly trained and competent, which helps ensure a degree of continuity. Conflicts between ministries are frequent but do not substantially affect overall policymaking in high-priority policy areas due to the coordinating role of the president’s office. Key issues that hold a high priority for the president can be effectively coordinated among relevant ministries, while areas that are not prioritized by the president tend to exhibit departmentalism and fragmentation.\n\nThe performance of the parliament is hampered by the National Assembly Advancement Act of 2012. The act requires the consent of three-fifths of lawmakers serving on parliamentary committees before a bill can be brought to a vote in the plenary and limits the power of the assembly speaker to bring a bill to a vote. The legislation was intended to prevent the majority party from unilaterally passing controversial bills using its majority. However, this means that without cooperation between the ruling and main opposition parties, or a significant defection from the opposition bloc, the ruling party is incapable of passing legislation.\n\nAnother performance-related problem is the lack of independence accorded to local governments, as they depend on the central government for revenues. Financial independence ratios of provinces and municipalities steadily decreased over the past decade. The central government often uses its leverage to intervene in local affairs. President Moon committed to, but was ultimately unable to achieve, boosting the financial independence and administrative authority of local governments and fostering balanced national development.\n\nThe party system is arguably the weakest link in South Korean democracy; parties are very unstable. Party organizations are weak, with very few dues-paying members and largely without a grassroots connection. Parties are organized around a small number of powerful individuals and function largely as “electoral clubs” in order to bring members into public office, in particular the presidency. They are founded, merged, renamed and dissolved largely at will, leading to a relatively high degree of voter volatility.\n\nLocal party offices are forbidden by law, contributing to the fact that parties have only weak grassroots connections. Regional fragmentation is another big problem, with the ruling party dominating the southeastern region and the opposition party dominating the southwest. On the other hand, ideological fragmentation and polarization is limited in the sense that political positions in most policy fields are flexible and change according to public opinion. One of the few fields characterized by significant ideological polarization is policy toward North Korea.\n\nThe reform of the parliamentary election process, which was passed in late 2019, was intended to strengthen parties organized around political goals. While the intention to strengthen proportional representation in parliament was laudable, the reform inadvertently exacerbated the situation because – in a legally dubious move – former members of major parties established satellite parties to exploit the advantages of the new election system. Further reforms are needed to ensure a more accurate reflection of voters’ preferences in the allocation of representative seats.\n\nWhile ideological polarization is limited, the two major political camps remain unforgiving in their struggle over political power and moral legitimacy. For the Democratic Party, the Conservative Party represents the legacy of military rule. Meanwhile, the Conservative Party suspects the Democratic Party of sympathizing with North Korea. The two political camps fight tooth and nail over seemingly minor differences, each portraying themselves as the defenders of democracy against the dangerous (if not evil) ideas of the opponent (Kim 2020; Shin 2020). For example, some members of the then-opposition characterized the pandemic disaster relief allowance not only as wasteful but as socialist (Kim and Kim 2020). For its part, the Democratic Party has been keen to discredit the Conservative Party by associating it with its history of military rule and colonial collaboration. As most South Koreans identify themselves as “moderately progressive” (38%) or centrist (32%), both sides seem to believe they can benefit from branding their opponents as extremists (Kim 2020). Given this “us against them” mentality, South Korea’s National Assembly is notorious for political gridlock.\n\nThe South Korean financial system is highly differentiated and largely follows international standards. The principle international standards are Basel II and Basel III, although the gradual implementation of Basel III was deferred by one year to January 1, 2023.\n\nThe Financial Supervisory Commission (FSC) and the Financial Supervisory Service (FSS) are the supervisory authorities for banks and financial markets in South Korea. The FSC is a government agency in charge of rulemaking and licensing, while the FSS is in charge of supervision, consumer protection and other oversight activities delegated by the FSC. The FSS is a special legislated body staffed not by civil servants but by private sector employees.\n\nMajor South Korean banks remain well above the Bank of International Settlements (BIS) capital adequacy ratio. The ratio decreased due to corporate loans increasing and the U.S. dollar strengthening. According to the World Bank, the general bank capital-to-asset ratio for the country was 7.5% in 2020. Notably, no major south Korean bank experienced failure during the global financial crisis. Nonetheless, the utilization of the BIS ratio as an international standard proved ineffective in preventing a few small bankruptcies among savings banks.\n\nHousehold debt remains one of the biggest risks to South Korea’s economy, with the ratio of household debt-to-GDP at 104% – one of the highest among major economies. So far, the share of nonperforming loans remains low, at 0.3% as of the end of June 2022. The growth of household lending slowed in 2022 due to rising interest rates and increasing government restrictions on real estate transactions. Several real estate policies introduced by the Land Ministry and the Finance Ministry during the Moon administration to reduce speculation were deemed ineffective. The Yoon administration has vowed to thoroughly revise real estate policy. The new policies will differ from the previous ones in three major aspects, namely by expanding housing supply, easing the burden of real estate tax and deregulating housing-related loans.\n\nThe South Korean stock market remains shallow, with few high-quality stocks. Consequently, the stock market largely remains a place for speculation and is extremely volatile. The large number of transactions reflects a short-term focus and speculative mindset among investors.\n\nThe South Korean constitution states that “there shall be no discrimination in political, economic, social, or cultural life on account of sex, religion, or social status” (Article 11). Unfortunately, South Korea still lacks a comprehensive anti-discrimination law that would enforce these constitutional rights. In fact, discrimination remains a major problem in South Korea, particularly for women, migrants, people with disabilities, LGBTQ+ people and North Korean defectors. Women are still underrepresented in the labor market, making up only 42.6% of the labor force, despite having a similar education level. In the Global Gender\n\nGap Report 2022, South Korea ranked 99th out of 145 countries evaluated. The gender pay gap remains the largest in the OECD, with women earning 31.4% less than men on average in 2021. Additionally, the COVID-19 shock disproportionately affected female workers, as they outnumber men in the service sector and non-regular jobs – groups that were highly affected by the pandemic. In leadership positions, only 19.8% of women held positions in state-funded and large private companies in 2019. As of 2023, women comprise only 19.1% of National Assembly members, and only three of the 19 ministers in the current cabinet are women. President Yoon Suk-yeol, who won the presidential elections in April 2022, abolished gender quotas for his cabinet and has promised to abolish the Ministry of Gender Equality and Family.\n\nRegarding education, equality of opportunity is significantly impacted by socioeconomic status. Due to a competitive education system, South Koreans heavily invest in private education (e.g., hagwons and cramming schools) to prepare their children. In 2021, 60% of expenditure at the tertiary level in South Korea came from private sources, compared to an average of 30% across the OECD.\n\nDiscrimination against irregular workers, including North Korean defectors and ethnic Koreans from other countries (primarily China), remains widespread. Discrimination against foreigners regarding COVID-19 policies continued until the end of 2021, as the government decided not to recognize vaccinations received by foreigners abroad. Although courts have bolstered rights for LGBTQ+ individuals, the government has not taken decisive action to reduce discrimination. An anti-discrimination law, which was proposed in 2020 and inspired hope for change, has yet to be voted on by the National Assembly.\n\nPolicy coordination in South Korea takes place in a hierarchical and centralized manner. Power is concentrated in the central government and particularly in the president’s office. The president’s 0ffice (the Blue House) ensures that important policies are implemented. Provincial governments, although having their own functions to some extent, basically serve as an intermediary between the central and municipal governments. Local governments depend heavily on the central government for funding and guidance. Their main function is to implement centrally determined policies and programs, as directed and guided by central government ministries and agencies. The high degree of centralization allows for largely coherent policy implementation. Within the government, the Finance Ministry has budget planning authority and is clearly dominant, able to block initiatives by the line ministries.\n\nConflicts between ministries are frequent but do not affect overall policymaking for high-priority policy areas due to the coordinating role of the president’s office. The fragmentation of government activities in policy areas that are not prioritized by the president is a frequent subject of criticism and ministries often fail to coordinate activities in these fields. Ministers in South Korea depend almost solely on the support of the president. The president has the authority to appoint and dismiss ministers, and frequently reshuffles the cabinet. High turnover limits ministers’ independence, as they are unable to develop their own voice to pursue their own or institutional policy ideas. President Moon reshuffled his cabinet four times in as many years.\n\nHigh-priority issues for the president can be effectively coordinated among relevant ministries, while departmentalism and fragmentation characterize areas not prioritized by the president.\n\nFor example, South Korea’s COVID-19 response and recovery efforts were a key presidential priority and were consequently well-coordinated. Regular meetings of the Central Disaster and Safety Countermeasures Headquarters (CDSCHQ) – which brought together representatives of all relevant ministries, and 17 provinces and major cities – were held to ensure a cohesive national approach to combating the spread of the virus. The meetings facilitated coordination between high-ranking officials from both central and local government, and were vital to identifying problems, overcoming obstacles and devising solutions. The regular meetings facilitated a concerted implementation process, the effective allocation of resources by the central government and rapid local adaptation when necessary.\n\nCorruption remains a major problem in South Korea, although anti-corruption institutions have improved substantially over time. Rules requiring audits of state spending and party financing, access to information and officeholder accountability are in place, but these have not been fully successful in eradicating corruption. Parachute appointments (nakhasan) are still common among retired bureaucrats, who often land jobs in the same industries they were charged with regulating. While laws exist to limit this, if bureaucrats obtain special permission from public service ethics committees, they can get around such restrictions.\n\nAs seen in the protests against former President Park, the Korean public, civil society organizations and the media are vigilant and ready to engage in effective protest of top-level abuses of power. Courts have also been tough on those involved in corruption scandals, even handing down long prison sentences to former presidents. While courts tend to hand down harsh sentences against former public officials, they tend to be much more lenient when it comes to corruption in the private sector. President Moon promised to strengthen anti-corruption initiatives and said he would not pardon members of the elite involved in corruption scandals, as had previously been common practice in South Korea. Reneging on this promise, Moon pardoned former President Park Geun-hye and effectively pardoned Samsung Electronics Vice Chairman Lee Jae-yong. During his first months in office, President Yoon pardoned former President Lee Myung-bak.\n\nSeveral institutions hold politicians and public servants accountable and penalize wrongdoing. The Korea Independent Commission Against Corruption, established under the Anti-Corruption Act, handles whistleblowers’ reports, recommends policies and legislation for combating corruption, and examines the integrity of public institutions. The Public Service Ethics Act is designed to prevent high-ranking public officials from reaping financial gains related to their duties both during and after their period of public employment. The South Korean parliament does not have an ombudsman office, but the Ombuds Office of the Anti-Corruption and Civil Rights Commission of Korea (ACRC) may be seen as a functional equivalent to a parliamentary ombuds office. The Improper Solicitation and Graft Act, which was initiated by the ACRC, has had a huge impact on changing the culture. The commission’s independence is guaranteed by law, although the standing members of the commission are all appointed by the president. Most ACRC members are drawn from the legal profession, which could limit its ability to proactively and independently serve as an ombuds office across a wide range of areas. People can petition the government directly without approaching the parliament or the ombudsman. The Foreign Investment Ombudsman (FIO) system hears complaints from foreign companies operating in South Korea. The FIO is commissioned by the president on the recommendation of the Minister of Trade, Industry and Energy via the deliberation of the Foreign Investment Committee. The FIO has the authority to request cooperation from the relevant administrative agencies and recommend the implementation of new policies to improve the foreign investment promotion system. It can also carry out other tasks to assist foreign companies in resolving their grievances. Most recently, the Moon administration created the Corruption Investigation Office for High-Ranking Officials.\n\nDespite the strong campaign against corruption in the public sector, the government has achieved minimal success in curbing corruption and influence-peddling by big business groups. One serious concern is the massive degree to which economic power is concentrated and the lack of respect that some economic elites show for the law. Courts are much more lenient toward businessmen than toward public officials.\n\nWhile South Korea has consistently scored 0.73 (on a scale of 0 to 1) on the World Justice Project Rule of Law Index since 2016, its government corruption score (0.67) is among its lowest component scores.\n\nSouth Korea’s civil society is one of the most vibrant in the Asia-Pacific region. Civil society organizations (CSOs) and engaged citizens are active in monitoring and holding accountable the public and private sectors. The 2016/2017 candlelight protests, which ultimately led to the impeachment of former President Park Geun-hye, as well as the 2019 protests both for and against former Minister of Justice Cho Guk, revealed a high level of political information and interest among the South Korean public. In particular, many young people and students participated in these protests. Younger people are responsible for most of the more than one million petitions that have been filed with the Blue House since the presidential petition system was launched in 2017. The South Korean public, civil society organizations and media are vigilant and ready to effectively protest high-level abuses of power. The #MeToo movement has also brought many abuse-of-power cases to light.\n\nCivil society participation strengthened under President Moon. The previous conservative governments under presidents Lee and Park were known for their top-down approach, and civil society groups largely lost their ability to influence the government. In contrast, President Moon emphasized transparency, communication with citizens and civil society participation. He held frequent discussions with civil society groups and senior business leaders; introduced a petition system in which the government is required to address the topic of a petition that at least 200,000 citizens have signed; and held deliberative democratic consultations to provide input into controversial policies in areas such as nuclear energy and university admissions. President Moon also appointed many former civil society activists to government positions and frequently utilized the expertise of civil society groups. He adopted a more accommodating stance on labor unions and was able to bring the Korean Confederation of Trade Unions (the more hard-line of the two umbrella trade unions) back to the tripartite dialogue table for the first time since the KCTU’s withdrawal in 1999. Unfortunately, the co-optation of some civil society groups has negatively affected these groups’ ability to offer a critical perspective on policies and act as a check on the government.\n\nSome fear that the pro-business Yoon administration will revert to more selective consultation practices favoring big business over labor and other stakeholder groups. Yoon has already taken a harder line against labor unions and NGOs, citing the need for greater financial transparency and responsibility by such entities.\n\nThe media is a weak link in South Korea’s civil society and underperforms in its role as a facilitator of public debate. Part of the problem is the country’s strong commercialism and associated weakness in the area of political journalism. Newspapers and TV rely heavily on advertising revenues. Most prominent TV stations produce a mix of infotainment and quality information about government policies. Another problem is that the major newspapers lean to the political right, although alternatives exist. In general, political reporting tends to be framed in the context of personalized power politics, diverting attention away from important policy issues.\n\nSouth Korea is generally considered to be a credible partner by the global community. It is a member of the United Nations, the WTO, the IMF, the World Bank, the G-20 and many more of the most important international organizations.\n\nSouth Korea rarely plays a leading role in international cooperation. Nevertheless, South Korea does play a role in international organizations. For example, it contributes actively to U.N. peacekeeping missions and is a growing contributor to development cooperation. South Korea joined the OECD Development Assistance Committee (DAC) in 2009, although it has been slow to increase its spending in line with the DAC goal of 0.7% of GNI. Furthermore, South Korea is committed to the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) and has signed the Paris Agreement on reducing greenhouse gas emissions. However, South Korea cannot be considered a leader in these fields, as its national sustainability and emissions-reduction goals are underwhelming. For example, while the European Union has promised to reduce greenhouse gas emissions to 40% below 1990 levels, South Korea has only pledged to reduce emissions to 40% below business-as-usual projections, which would represent an increase of 81% compared to 1990.\n\nWith its Digital, Green and Human New Deals policy, the Moon administration began to take a more proactive role in international cooperation. At a summit in 2021, President Moon and President Biden agreed on a U.S.-South Korea technology partnership. In 2020, South Korea pledged to achieve carbon neutrality by 2050, while it scaled up its NDC target at COP26 in 2021. In line with President Moon’s inclusive, human-centered vision for South Korean society, the administration finally pushed through three key ILO conventions, for which labor rights activists have been advocating for decades. Moreover, South Korea pledged to substantially increase its contributions to global health initiatives such as GAVI and the Global Fund.\n\nThe Yoon administration has indicated that the South Korean government will fulfill its responsibilities with regard to global issues, such as pandemics, climate change and development assistance (ODA), befitting the country’s growing stature on the international stage.\n\nDuring the review period, South Korea’s relationship with its immediate neighbors North Korea, Japan and China worsened. While relations with North Korea initially improved, no lasting improvements were achieved, and relations came to a standstill following the unsuccessful U.S.-North Korea meeting in Vietnam in February 2019. Relations with Japan further deteriorated amid disagreements on how to deal with atrocities committed during Japan’s occupation of Korea. In October 2018, South Korea’s Supreme Court ordered two Japanese companies to pay compensation for forcing Koreans to work. Japan retaliated against these rulings by restricting certain exports to Korea. These conflicts came on top of territorial disputes and a dispute about Japan’s use of sex slaves during World War 2. There are initial signs that relations with Japan will improve under the Yoon administration.\n\nTensions with China, which had eased during the Moon administration, have recently deteriorated as the Yoon administration has aligned more closely with the United States. South Korea is also contributing to the regional arms race, for example, by upgrading its blue-water navy, which comprises three battle groups led by Dokdo-class helicopter carriers. Furthermore, South Korea has emerged as a major arms exporter. In 2020, for the first term, South Korea entered the top 10 of the SIPRI list with a 143% increase in arms exports for the period from 2015 to 2019 compared to the period from 2010 to 2014.\n\nIn 2021, South Korea signed the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership (RCEP) with Japan, China, ASEAN, New Zealand and Australia. This trade agreement promises not only to facilitate trade in the region but also to introduce conflict resolution mechanisms. With the Yoon administration prioritizing security, South Korea’s relations with the United States and northeast Asia are likely to overshadow its cooperation with Southeast Asia.\n\nThe short-term challenge for the relatively new Yoon administration is to govern with a parliament firmly in the hands of the opposition, at least until the next parliamentary election in April 2024. Even then, it seems doubtful that President Yoon’s Conservative Party will regain a majority, considering his declining popularity. As a political outsider, he might theoretically be well placed to negotiate compromises with the opposition. However, he has so far preferred to brand himself as a strong leader, pushing through radical market reforms and taking a tough stance against protests, particularly from labor unions, as well as maintaining a hard line on North Korea. It is unlikely that he will be able to garner the support of the opposition Democratic Party for such radical changes. The recent raids on labor union offices – based on individual members’ contacts with North Korea – are also cause for concern, as the government may attempt to exploit North Korean connections as a pretext for silencing political opposition under the draconian National Security Law.\n\nSo far, the effects of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine on South Korea have been limited, although, in the medium term, South Korea will be affected by rising global energy prices. With a low share of renewable energy, South Korea is heavily dependent on imported fossil (and nuclear) fuels. State-owned energy companies are currently able to absorb some of the price increases by subsidizing energy, but this will become more expensive and challenging if energy prices remain high. Thus, the expansion of renewable energy, storage capacity and initiatives for energy saving will be among the most important economic challenges. The housing market, with sky-high real estate prices and massive household debts due to mortgages, poses another major threat to economic stability, particularly amid rising interest rates.\n\nAchieving a formal peace treaty or, at least, improving relations with North Korea remains a key challenge for South Korean diplomacy. Unlike President Moon, who unsuccessfully attempted to engage North Korea, President Yoon is considered a hard-liner on North Korea. Therefore, it is unlikely that there will be any major steps toward improved relations under the current administration. On the contrary, Yoon wants the United States to redeploy nuclear weapons to the peninsula and even suggested that South Korea should consider building its own nuclear weapons. While these remarks were seen critically in the United States, it is expected that relations with the United States will improve, as President Yoon is seen as a supporter of a strong U.S. military presence in South Korea. Improvements are also expected in relations with Japan, as Yoon is expected to have fewer expectations concerning reparations for Japanese atrocities committed during Japan’s colonial occupation of Korea. President Yoon will likely have a broader approach to foreign policies than his predecessors, extending beyond what is useful for North-South relations. Thus, we might see more international initiatives when it comes to important global challenges, such as climate change, development cooperation and international security."
