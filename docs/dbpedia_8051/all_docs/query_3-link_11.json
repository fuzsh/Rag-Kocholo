        "text": "Moon Jae-In\n\npresident of South Korea\n\nQuick Facts\n\nMoon Jae-In (born January 24, 1953, Geoje Island, South Gyeongsang province, South Korea) is a South Korean lawyer and civil rights activist who was the president of South Korea (2017–22) and leader of the liberal Democratic Party of Korea (2015–16).\n\nEarly life and education\n\nMoon’s parents were refugees who fled North Korea ahead of the 1950 Chinese winter offensive during the Korean War. They were among the 100,000 civilians evacuated from Hungnam, North Korea, during “Christmas Cargo,” a massive sealift that marked the conclusion of the Battle of the Chosin Reservoir. Moon was born at a refugee relocation center on Geoje, an island southwest of Busan. His family moved to Busan, and Moon spent his childhood there. He entered Kyung Hee University in Seoul in 1972 and became active in the student movement against the authoritarian regime of Pres. Park Chung-Hee. He was expelled and briefly imprisoned for his activism.\n\nIn 1975 Moon was conscripted into the South Korean army, in which he served as a special forces commando. In August 1976 two U.S. Army officers were murdered by North Korean troops during a routine tree-trimming exercise in the demilitarized zone (DMZ). Moon participated in Operation Paul Bunyan, the subsequent massive show of force that accompanied the complete removal of the tree. After completing his military service in 1978, Moon returned to his studies and earned a law degree from Kyung Hee University in 1980. In 1982 he established a legal practice in Busan with his friend and future South Korean president Roh Moo-Hyun. The pair specialized in civil and human rights matters, and they worked to defend trade unionists and student activists who faced persecution under Pres. Chun Doo-Hwan. With the restoration of democracy in 1987, Roh transitioned to politics while Moon continued his legal career.\n\nRole in the Roh Moo-Hyun administration\n\nWhen Roh was elected president in December 2002, he invited Moon to serve in his cabinet. Roh took office in February 2003, and Moon was named Roh’s senior secretary for civil affairs. Throughout Roh’s presidency, Moon’s prominent role in the administration earned him the nickname “Shadow of Roh.” Although he was one of Roh’s most trusted advisers, Moon largely sought to avoid the public attention that typically accompanies such a position. In March 2004 Roh was the target of an impeachment motion by opposition lawmakers, and Moon joined the legal team that argued Roh’s case before the Constitutional Court. The South Korean public overwhelmingly opposed the impeachment, and the Constitutional Court ruled in Roh’s favor in May 2004. Later that year, Moon helped inaugurate the Kaesong Industrial Complex, a duty-free trade zone and manufacturing complex just north of the DMZ that was jointly operated by the governments of North and South Korea. The Kaesong venture was one of the more prominent expressions of Roh’s strategy of engagement with the North, and it represented a continuation of the “sunshine” policy initiated by Roh’s predecessor, Kim Dae-Jung.\n\nThe “sunshine” policy suffered a serious blow in October 2006, however, when North Korea successfully tested a nuclear weapon. Nevertheless, Moon, who had been named Roh’s chief of staff, was the principal organizer of a historic summit between Roh and North Korean leader Kim Jong Il in October 2007. That meeting led to an ambitious eight-point plan designed to bring peace to the Korean peninsula. The unexpectedly positive outcome of the summit did little to boost Roh’s sagging approval ratings, and his chosen successor, Chung Dong-Young, was crushed by conservative candidate Lee Myung-Bak in the 2007 presidential election. Both Roh and Moon returned to private life in 2008, but the following year, Roh became the target of a bribery investigation. In May 2009 Roh took his own life, leaving behind a suicide note in which he referenced ill health and a desire to preserve what remained of his legacy. Moon oversaw the memorial services for his friend, and he went on to serve as the chairperson for the Roh Moo-Hyun Foundation, an organization dedicated to Roh’s memory and the continuation of his work.\n\nPath to the presidency\n\nIn 2012 Moon entered electoral politics for the first time, winning a seat in the National Assembly representing the Sasang district of Busan. That December he was the Democratic United Party (DUP) candidate in the presidential contest against Park Geun-Hye, the daughter of Park Chung-Hee. Moon was narrowly defeated, but he remained active in politics at both the national and party level. In February 2015 he was named chairperson of the DUP’s successor, the New Politics Alliance for Democracy (NPAD). The day after Moon’s elevation to party chief, a South Korean appellate court ruled that the National Intelligence Service had orchestrated an illegal online whispering campaign against Park’s opponents prior to the 2012 presidential election. The court declined to comment on whether the interference had altered the outcome of the election. Moon chose not to run for reelection for his National Assembly seat in 2016.\n\nGet a Britannica Premium subscription and gain access to exclusive content.

Park was accused of extorting tens of millions of dollars from companies by threatening them with financial audits if they did not donate to charitable foundations operated by her friend, Choi Soon-Sil. As details of the scandal were uncovered, demonstrators called for Park’s resignation and staged the largest street protests since the restoration of democracy. Park’s Saenuri Party had lost its legislative majority in April 2016, and a resurgent Democratic Party (the successor to the NPAD) began to push for her removal. In December Park was impeached by an overwhelming majority, and on March 10, 2017, the Constitutional Court upheld that decision.\n\nPark’s impeachment triggered a snap election, and Moon quickly emerged as the front-runner. Moon pledged to rein in the power of the chaebols, to sever the ties between government and business, and to adopt a more nuanced North Korea policy. His strongest conservative challenger, former United Nations secretary-general Ban Ki-Moon, had declared in February 2017 that he would not enter the race. Software magnate Ahn Cheol-Soo, who had supported Moon in 2012, threatened to split the centrist vote with a technocratic “third way” campaign, but he ultimately fell short. Despite Ahn’s last-minute surge, Moon won the May 9, 2017, contest in a landslide, becoming South Korea’s first liberal president in nearly a decade."
