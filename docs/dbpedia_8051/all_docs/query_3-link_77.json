        "text": "Seoul: Yoon Suk-yeol has been elected South Korea’s next President after riding a wave of popular support in a bitter battle over the future of the politically divided nation.\n\nWith about 98 per cent of the ballots counted as of 4am, People Power Party candidate Yoon had won 48.59 per cent of the votes, narrowly edging liberal rival Lee Jae-myung who garnered 47.80 per cent.\n\nYoon thanked his supporters outside his home in the capital Seoul after what he described as a “long night”. The vote was the tightest Presidential race in South Korean history.\n\nHe spoke shortly after Lee conceded defeat during a news conference at the campaign office of his Democratic Party, where he congratulated Yoon and called for him to heal the country’s divisions.\n\nYoon will take office in May and serve a single five-year term as leader of the world’s 10th-largest economy, which is now grappling with stark income inequalities and soaring personal debt and facing growing threats from nuclear-armed North Korea.\n\nThe result will herald a geopolitical shift in Asia after five years of cautious diplomacy under the Democratic Party rule of Moon Jae-in. Yoon, the first political novice to be elected Korean President, has promised to push Korea closer to the United States and strengthen the country’s response to a rising China.\n\nThe vote for Yoon capped off a month-long Presidential campaign that saw both leaders target young swing voters growing restless over job insecurity, soaring house prices and gender roles.\n\nIn a last-ditch effort to rally support, the Democratic Party and People Power Party held rallies for tens of thousands of Koreans in Seoul on election eve despite adding 342,000 COVID-19 cases that day.\n\nThe two squares – less than 500 metres apart – were filled with blue and red, Korean flags and a populace bitterly divided about the best way forward for a country that in the space of six decades has left behind civil war and a dictatorship to emerge as one of Asia’s most vibrant democracies. More than 75 per cent of 44 million eligible Korean voters went to the polls on Wednesday.\n\nThat meteoric economic rise has created a marketing behemoth that puts an emphasis on the identities of the two candidates – leading to campaigns that have become increasingly personal.\n\nBoth candidates attacked each other’s wives, Lee accused Yoon of being a drunkard, there were unsubstantiated allegations of voter fraud and claims that shamans had infiltrated the campaign. By the second week of the presidential race it had been dubbed the “election of the unfavourables” with up to 58 per cent of Koreans stating they disliked both candidates.\n\n“I support Yoon not because I want to bolster the conservative party [PPP] but because this country needs a regime change,” said former Democratic voter Byun Sung-chul, 48, who works in real estate. “If the change doesn’t happen, our democracy would continue to falter.”\n\nThe personal attacks obscured what were otherwise substantial policy differences. Yoon pledged to abolish the Gender Equality Ministry. Lee, a factory worker who became the governor of South Korea’s most powerful province, said he would develop Korea’s “work-life balance”.\n\nYoon told his supporters he would get the government out of their lives, Lee said South Korea needed a universal basic income to get through COVID-19. Yoon said he would foster closer ties with the United States and a harder line on China and North Korea.\n\n“Our national security will be at risk if we let a person like Yoon take the highest post,” said Min Kyung-chil, 81, a retired civil servant, outside Yoon’s local polling place at Wonmyung primary school in upmarket Gangnam.\n\nCongressman Kim Doo-kwan, who ran against Lee during the 2021 Democratic Party’s presidential primaries told The Sydney Morning Herald and The Age that he believed young voters would come back to the party after finding that Yoon did not have the policies to implement the vision he had promised.\n\n“We think Lee will win by a 1 percent margin, or about 200,000 votes,” he said before the vote.\n\nBut in the end it was Yoon, a public prosecutor that made his name going after the head of Samsung and former President Park Geun-hye who carried the popular imagination with a campaign that promised to drain the swamp of Korean politics by “sending the Democratic Party home” and implementing a vision of a strong Korea.\n\n“He looks like an upright person, a man who can power through difficult times,” said 47-year-old local artist and Yoon supporter Hong Jung-hee.\n\nYoon marshalled frustrated young men and some women by running a campaign that suggested the #MeToo movement had gone too far, men were being shut out of jobs and the five years of the Moon Jae-in government had divided society. That claim spoke to a generation of men that have seen the number of young adults giving up on finding work grow by 18.3 per cent since 2015, according to Korea’s Economic Research Institute.\n\nFei Xue, an asia analyst at the Economist Intelligence Unit, before the results were announced, said he expected Yoon to win the election because of public dissatisfaction with the Democratic Party and their role in “perpetuating economic inequality, their failure to curb rising property prices, and a lack of progress in tackling corruption and abuse of power”.\n\nPark Sung-min, the president of MIN Consulting said the shifting stance among young voters was critical – pushing them away from social welfare programs of the Democrats towards the pro-business, small government of the People’s Power Party.\n\nLoading\n\n“Unlike the baby boomers raised during a period of dynamic industrialisation and democratisation of the country, millennials and Gen Z were born into a relatively developed South Korea,” Park said."
