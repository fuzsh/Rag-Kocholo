Far in their van the Eagle Eye of Song Looms o'er Ravenna, where he died, and where He saw God's Freedom in the dazzling glare Of visions, which to every race belong. Him his redeemed, united Italy — Her Alps new crowned with M onza's iron band, Her Hadria wedded with her Doge's ring — Hails as the Prophet-Bard of Liberty; And bids the free of every tongue and land Join in her Ave, and their tribute bring.\n\nPREFACE V E R Y new translation of the Divine Comedy, though in itself a fresh tribute, however humble, to the interlingual, as well as to the international claims of \" the loftiest of poets,\" calls for a word of justification. That justification involves the expression of some theory as to the translation of Dante's world-poem, itself implying a criticism, whether expressed or not, of competitors already in the field.\n\nE\n\nThe present translation, which is the result of over twenty years' work with large classes in \" Dante in English \" at Brown University, was undertaken and continued with the object of meeting a need, which did not seem adequately met by the .well known translations of Cary, Longfellow, Norton, or others more recent; it, therefore, frankly aimed at being in every possible way an improvement on its rivals old and new. Since the advent of the feeling that minute loyalty to the actual words and thought of the original is a prerequisite to a translation of any poem of supreme human import, such a pioneer work as that of Cary, which so long held the field, came to be recognized as being, not only no longer abreast of the modern achievements of Dante scholars, but as inadequate in the above all-important respect. Longfellow's widely diffused version, which is an almost painfully accurate translation of the then accepted Italian text, at once attained great popularity not only in America [vii]\n\nPREFACE\n\nbut abroad, a popularity largely due to the poetical fame of its author, to its literal loyalty to every word of the original, for which it could so easily be made to serve as a ' pony,' and to the wealth and excellence of its accompanying notes. Longfellow, however, in his apparent eagerness to be true to every syllable of the Italian, was led to draw too much upon the tempting Latin element, which looks like Italian, and too little upon the stronger, homely Anglo-Saxon element, bf his English medium, to bring due conviction to an English ear; he was also betrayed into infelicities of construction and rhythm peculiarly surprising in such a poet as the author of the incomparable Dante Sonnets, a betrayal which has found explanation in the state of his mind and heart during the prosecution of the work. This, consequently, remains as an instance of a great translation which, not intended to be prose, ought not to have been thought of as poetry. After using it for two or three years, I gave it up, iii spite of its many happy lines, and valuable notes, because I found that I could not read it aloud with continuous pleasure either to myself or to my hearers. Possibly as a reaction against these obvious defects, Charles Eliot Norton produced his well known and excellent prose version, against which the only thing that can be said is, that it is just what it purports to be, prose, a prose only slightly hampered by extreme verbal loyalty; and that it was composed under the strange conviction, expressed in his preface, that \" to preserve in its integrity what \" (of the [ viii]\n\nPREFACE\n\nthought and sentiment embodied in the verse) \" may thus be transferred, prose is a better medium than verse.\" Admitting, however, that for the harmonious blending of meaning and music in the original, a new harmony might, indeed, be substituted, Mr. Norton unfortunately added: \" but the difference is fatal,\" and in giving up the creation of a new harmony himself, he lent the great authority of his name to the suggestion that any such attempt by others would prove futile. As to such efforts as that of Dean Plumptre and others to translate Dante in English terza rima, it ought to be sufficient to urge, in the first place, that rhymes are practically an insurmountable obstacle for one who, as a translator, is already limited by the demands of loyalty to another's articulated thought and feeling; and, secondly, that terza rima is not an indigenous, or even a fully acclimated, form of verse in English, and can not be made to sound natural to an English ear, or, at any rate, produce the effect it does in Italian, where it is to the manner born. I, therefore, feel that neither terza rima, nor, indeed, any rhymed translation in metrical forms still more alien in poetical tone to that in which the Divine Comedy was written, can prove to be at best other than unnatural and unsympathetic, though at times brilliant, tours deforce. Their readers will too often be met by forced constructions, and forced or weak rhymes, while students familiar with the Italian original will too often be grieved by omissions, weakenings, or additions, to [ix]\n\nPREFACE\n\nfeel that they have been brought into due spiritual, or even intellectual, proximity to it; for even in such interesting translations as those of Parsons and Shadwell, their rhymes and meters would seem to have been indulged in at too great a cost to the poem's thought, flow and tone. In view, then, of the above and other similar frank criticisms of the work of my predecessors in the fascinating field of Dante translation, I have been guided by the following considerations, which are modestly offered in justification of the aims, if not of the results, of a slowly matured effort, which has enjoyed the rare help of being progressively tested by being read aloud in public during many years. The transference of a poem from one tongue to another is capable of success in direct proportion to the degree in which the human and spiritual element in the original predominates over the artistry, however excellent, of the verse-form in which that element is embodied; the Divine Comedy, for example, differing vitally in this respect from such a poem as Poe's Raven, which owes relatively too much to the charm of its meter and syllables to lend itself to a successful translation. It is, therefore, possible for the indwelling spirit of a supremely great poem to reclothe itself fittingly, and yet retain its essential identity, because in such a case the spirit, and not the clothing, is paramountly the thing; being that which originally made itself a body, it can make itself another, whatever the former's perfection; but this is true only on condition that the new clothing fit it, and hold\n\n[x]\n\nPREFACE\n\nsomething like the same relation to it, as that sustained by the old clothing to the original. Now the evolution and acquired associations of poetical forms having, as I believe, given the qualities of blank verse the nearest possible position in English to those sustained by terza rima in Italian, notwithstanding the rhymes of the latter, blank verse would seem to be the translator's natural choice. Being rhythmical and also metrical, it can supply the translator with the emotional and fusing element fatally lacking in prose; and being free from the artificial bondage of rhymes, or stanza schemes, which can only rarely prove happy under the restraints of dictated thought, it will release him from all temptation to disloyalty to the integrity of the original's intellectual and spiritual message, or to any interruption of that formal continuity, which is a quality that blank verse and terza rima possess in common, in spite of the latter's divisibility into terzine. For these reasons I cannot but feel that blank verse would be the medium that Dante himself would use, were he writing the same poem in English now, to say nothing of what he would do, were he translating it into that language. This blank verse must, however, be loyal to itself and to its own laws, and must not take any such liberties with them as too many manufacturers of \" vers libres,\" so-called, seem to think proof against the charge of license. In other words, a blank verse line cannot be made by applying scissors to indifferent prose. Again, in some such use of blank verse [xi]\n\nPREFACE\n\nas that suggested, it will no longer be necessary to pad or truncate the words or thought of the original poem, since two lines and a fraction, or four lines, as the case may be, can be made to represent with due spiritual loyalty the poetical matter of the three lines of the Italian terzina. Feeling, then, that blank verse is not merely the best, but the only organically satisfactory, medium afforded by the English language for a translation of the Divine Comedy, I have aimed, in using it, at being loyal, first to the spiritual tone and thought, next to the words, and last of all to the syllables and line dimensions of the Italian text, believing with the poet Spenser that the poem's soul, if caught to any extent, will somehow make itself a body out of whatever natural material it be afforded; but that, contrariwise, the most perfect imitation of a former body, such as has been achieved in a Dante translation by using feminine rhymes having the same vowel as in the original, will not reproduce the spirit. Aiming ever at keeping the reader's attention from being unnaturally diverted, I have tried to avoid the use of any word whose archaic nature would draw an attention to itself, not drawn to its Italian counterpart. I have furthermore striven to keep myself free from all organic omissions or additions, however sorely tempted by actual indolence, or fancied inspiration, in the hope that a faithful translation, expressed in the best English and in the best blank verse at my command, would ultimately enable me to render with some success the homely directness and famili[xii]\n\nPREFACE arity, the strength and beauty, the satire, pathos, and even the sublimity, of the ever varying component parts of the Italian poem; and that the latter, if placed on guard, as it were, on the opposite page, as I am grateful for having it placed, would serve as an ever present criterion of its English portrait, and also prove a persuasive to the reader of the translation to render himself more and more familiar with the compelling harmonies of its model's soul and form. Accurate and sympathetic reproduction of its\n\nauthor's\n\nthoughts and moods, good English, and good verse have, therefore, been the triune aim of my long continued work on the poem's every line and poetic unit, with what result the reader and student must be the ultimate judge, no one realizing more than I how far any achievement is likely to be from its inspiring ideal. T h e Italian text is that of the Vandelli edition of 1914, with such changes in individual words, spelling, and punctuation as, in my judgment, seemed warranted in themselves, and justified b y having been adopted b y one or more of such accredited Italian editors of the poem as Torraca, Casini, Passerini, or, in some instances, by our American Dantist, Dr. Grandgent.\n\nIn very few cases only have I risked erring\n\nheretically on the side of radical boldness in adopting a rejected variant which seemed more Dante-like, or more consistent with its immediate or more remote context, than that of the textus receptus.\n\nOn the other hand, several temp-\n\ntations to make Dante say in my translation something in [xiii]\n\nPREFACE\n\na given place that was truer, stronger, more beautiful, or more refined, than what was strictly warranted by the words he there used and by their context, have been sternly, though at times regretfully, resisted. On the English page the reader will see that in the vast majority of cases I have found it possible to have three lines of blank verse match the three Unes of each opposite terzina without disloyalty to the interests of either. Where this seemed impossible or undesirable, simple typographical devices have been adopted, to keep up the useful parallelism to the eye, without detriment to the flow or metrical integrity of the English verse. Again, in the translation the subject matter has been helped, I trust, by being divided into paragraphs, with the object of making the dialogue clearer, as well as of isolating and framing independent gems of thought, feeling or description. A temperate use of capitals has been made in printing both texts with a similar aim. In dealing with the title Maestro, as applied to Virgil by Dante, I have replaced the usual translation, Master, by that of Teacher, which more correctly and unambiguously distinguishes his function as an instructor from that of lord, leader, or guide. In the translation of individual words — idiomatic phrases having been rendered as far as possible by idiomatic equivalents — while careful to reproduce Dante's quaint choices, when illuminating, I have not always thought it a part of loyalty to reproduce obscurities, when obviously due, in spite of his reported claim to the contrary, to the tyrannical exigencies [xiv]\n\nPREFACE\n\nof his rhymes; for though the latter may never have led him to say what he did not wish to say, they often forced him to say it less clearly. The grave accent has been used for all purposes in the Italian text, except that of marking a closed o or e, and in the English, to facilitate the pronunciation of proper nouns, or the rhythmic reading of the verse; while a free use has been made of the apostrophe, as one way of rendering the frequently colloquial style of the Italian, and in such embarrassing cases as that of see'st when pronounced as one syllable. In the hope of publishing before long a fourth volume containing a running commentary on the poem, all notes have been omitted from the pages of the translation, what seemed indispensable being inserted in the Interpretative Analysis, which will explain itself. Coming now to the question of indebtedness, apart from what I personally owe to the happy accident of my Italian birth and early familiarity with both Italian and English, and from what every Dante scholar consciously or unconsciously owes to the high lights, old and new, of the vast and rich body of Dante literature; as well as apart from that deeper spiritual indebtedness which could only find adequate expression in the simple Italian words of my dedication; I wish here to express my special gratitude to Dr. Harry L. Koopman, Librarian of Brown University, for the uncounted hours of his valuable time, the long continued and ever increasing sympathy, the convincing praise and persuasive disapproval, without which I might have had to advance too [xv]\n\nPREFACE\n\noften not only \" silent, alone, and unaccompanied,\" but unquickened and unchecked; as well as to one who was my pupil when I began this work, and has ever since been my friend, Mr. Henry D. Sharpe, of Providence, for the liberal generosity which enabled me to spend an unhampered year in Florence, in the atmosphere of Dante scholars, whose scientific zeal for the letter of Dante's text never blurs their Latin vision of the poem's spirit, or of its national and world significance. Among the latter, Dr. Guido Biagi of the Laurentian Library, and Count Giuseppe Lando Passerini, editor of the Giornale Dantesco, are here most gratefully remembered for courtesies, encouragement, and help extended to me during my stay in Florence. Finally, before closing a preface to what I hope will prove to have, under the present circumstances of the world, something more than merely a scholarly import, I cannot forego the opportunity of recording the intense joy with which, as an American who, born in Rome and brought up in Florence, lived to become a lover not only of Dante the Poet, but also of Dante the Patriot, I appreciate the full significance of its date. Nineteen hundred and seventeen will be remembered as the year in which, under the inspiring moral leadership of a Veltro-like, democratic King, Italy, robed in the symbolic colors of Beatrice, was about to attain that complete national unification and redemption of her people, of which Dante was, as he still is, the creative Poet-prophet, and one of whose results will be that, in Dante's oft quoted [xvi ]\n\nPREFACE\n\nwords, Quarnaro's gulf will again \" bound Italia, and her border bathe; \" and also as the year in which, in virtual alliance with America, she made her marvelous Latin contribution toward the universal attainment and preservation of that Liberty, personal, national and international, \" for whose sake death did not prove bitter \" to her sons on land or sea, or in the air, or even upon the snow clad sister summits of those Alps, \" which o'er the Tyrol lock out Germany \" from what has ever been the imperial garden of a World Culture, which, like its fairest single flower, Dante's Commedia, is not only scientific, but human and divine. COURTNEY LANGDON. PROVIDENCE, RHODE ISLAND,\n\nOctober 28, 1917.\n\n[ xvii ]\n\nINTERPRETATIVE ANALYSIS OF THE INFERNO The letter kületh, but the spirit giveth life.\n\nHROUGH the following notes of an Analysis which has been made as brief as possible, with due regard to the needs of the general reader of the translation, there runs an Interpretation for which, as a whole, its author is alone responsible. While all notes of a linguistic or historical character are based upon the researches of the most accredited scholars in the field, others, which progressively develop the Interpretation, are based rather upon the belief that for the non-professional reader — the reader who belongs to the great class of honnêtes gens, for whom French literary men proudly claim that they prefer to write — it is far more important to try to show what a great work of art means, or can self-consistently be seen to mean, now, than what it may seem to have meant to its author's contemporaries, or even to the author himself, when viewed from afar in the dim and dry light of time-hampered research. Its permanent truth and beauty, and their present-day suggestions, being after all what is most valuable and enjoyable in such a poem as the Divine Comedy, it should be remembered that spiritual truth is seedlike, and grows, and therefore increases and\n\n[xix]\n\nINTERPRETATIVE ANALYSIS\n\ndeepens in significance with the progress made in spiritual appreciation by the ages which in turn receive it. Even great poets build better than they consciously know, and better, certainly, than their outclassed contemporaries are aware of; hence it would seem to be no part of loyalty to insist that the inspirations of a supreme poet's genius shall be narrowed down in meaning to the relatively little which a later century can intellectually leam from the painful limitations of the age from which he had to procure their clothing. Let the reader, then, separate, if he must, what seems scholarly in these fragmentary and purposely succinct notes from what their writer, who confesses to be more concerned with the poem's flowers and their implications than with its roots and sources, claims is only a self-consistent, personal interpretation, which at least may spur those that cannot accept it in parts, or as a whole, to realize the value of drawing from the poet's inexhaustibly fertile suggestions an edifying interpretation of their own, and, in their own way, of \" heeding carefully the teaching which lies hidden beneath the veil of the poet's mysterious lines.\" Since, then, linguistic, historical and geographical notes to a poem are a necessary evil, and only justified by the ordinary reader's natural unfamiliarity with its illustrative allusions, they have not been forced upon his attention any more than need be. For a similar reason almost all references to authorities or sources, as well as all linguistic notes to the Italian text, have been relegated to the pages of the pro[xx]\n\nINTERPRETATIVE ANALYSIS\n\nspective Commentary, in which an attempt will be made to show what Dante did not get from any of his \" sources,\" and what few of his commentators, and then only sporadically, got from him. As to the Interpretation of the teaching, instead of being formulated in an Introduction, which \" would have vainly boasted \" of vying, in their method, with the Introduction and Arguments of Dr. Grandgent's Dante, it will be found to follow step by step the natural evolution of the poem's thought. It is, therefore, suggested that the corresponding part of what follows be read by those who do not claim to be Dante scholars between a first and a second reading of each canto's translation; a reference to the linenumbers on the Italian page will guide the reader to the answers furnished to all questions that will probably be asked, while those in the Analysis will lead its more leisurely students to the lines of the text upon which comment is made. Of this progressive Interpretation the fundamental contentions are: that Dante, while frequently drawing illustrations of his teaching from his own personal experience, is throughout the poem making himself a representative of Man in general as he is brought face to face with those universal moral, and spiritual problems of life, which change only in their intellectual clothing from age to age, from race to race, and even from man to man; that spiritually sin and virtue are, respectively, their own all-sufficient punishment and reward; that what in the letter of the allegorical story is said of the fate of individuals is to be taken only as illustrac i\n\n]\n\nINTERPRETATIVE ANALYSIS\n\ntive of the significance of states of moral and spiritual consciousness; that neither Hell, Purgatory nor Heaven are places, but states of which all men can at any time have experience; that the moment of physical death has no special eternal significance, except in so far as it symbolizes those critical spiritual moments when man's spirit is eclipsed by entering the shadow of the Wrath of God, or swims into the ken of His Love; that Eternity is something infinitely more, and other, than endless astronomic time; and that, finally, the Divine Comedy, while very significant as a supreme Italian, Catholic, Scholastic and fourteenth-century work of art, has an import for all men and for all ages which breaks through the bonds of the language, theology, philosophy and times which gave it form, far more victoriously and often than is generally realized — an import which can be grasped only by emphasizing the high-water marks of its insight into Reality, and by never letting its teaching's spirit drop to the level of its avowedly hampered letter, whose latent spiritual significance needs translation into terms of twentieth century appreciation far more than its Italian does into English. To help bring into clearer light these eternal spiritual aspects of the world's greatest single poem is the object of this translation, and especially of its accompanying interpretative notes.\n\n[_ xxii ]\n\nINTERPRETATIVE\n\nCANTO\n\nANALYSIS\n\nI\n\nINTRODUCTION TO THE ALLEGORY OF THE DIVINE COMEDY. DANTE, M A N .\n\nT H E WOOD AND THE MOUNTAIN.\n\nTHREE WILD BEASTS.\n\nVIRGIL, M A N ' S REASON\n\nTHE .\n\n.\n\ni . Dante, representing Man, astray in the Wood of Sin, at the age of thirty-five. Dante having been born in 1265, the date of the Vision recorded in the Poem is 1300. 13. T h e Mountain of the ideal life of Virtue. 17. The sun, a planet in the Ptolemaic system of astronomy. 32, 45, 49. The three symbolic Beasts: the sensual Leopard of Incontinent Appetite; the arrogant Lion of Bestial Violence; and the greedy, materialistic Wolf of Malicious Fraud and Treachery. 37. Later than the time of line 13, early in the morning of Good Friday, 1300, at the beginning of Spring, when the sun was in the constellation of Aries, where it was believed to have been on the day of Creation. 63. Virgil, Dante's first Guide and Teacher, the symbol of Man's Reason, or of his intellectual, aesthetic and moral faculties, of which the University and State may be the organized collective instrumentalities. 73. Aeneas. 79. Virgil, as author of the Aeneid, the poem of Rome's civilizing mission, acknowledged as the Poet of poets, and as his inspiring Teacher b y Dante, who asks his help against the insatiable Wolf of Materialism and Greed. 94. The Wolf, evidently the most dangerous of the three Beasts to Dante, represents the class of sins spiritually the most dangerous to Man. 101. The prophecy of the Veltro, or Hound, a vaguely described future deliverer of Italy, Can Grande (the great Dog) della Scala, of Verona, which lies between two Feltros, being possibly intended. 107. Italian heroes who, on one side or the other, died in the Trojans' war under Aeneas for the conquest of Italy. HI. That the source of the Wolf is E n v y , the offspring of Pride, falls in with the above interpretation of the worst of the three animals, Greed. 112. The course of Salvation through Hell, and Purgatory, the eternal states of Disobedience and Slavery, and of the humble Reconquest of Liberty, under the guidance of Virgil, or Reason; and, later, through Paradise, the state of loving Obedience and Freedom, under the guidance of Beatrice, the symbol of Man's Spiritual faculty, whose functions are Faith, Hope and Love, and of which the Church may be the organized\n\n[[ x x i i i J\n\n2-13\n\nINTERPRETATIVE\n\nANALYSIS\n\ncollective instrumentality. 125. Virgil's incompetence as a Pagan signifies that mere Reason is not qualified to make Man's higher nature spiritually happy. 134. The Gate of Purgatory proper, which ultimately leads to Paradise. In the translation it will be noticed that line 15 has been printed in two parts, which together form a regular blank verse line; this was done here, as elsewhere in the book, so as to avoid padding the thought, and leaving a blank line on the printed page. The usual rendering of line 37 is: \" The time was at the morning's first beginning,\" which, while a possible meaning of the Italian, does not seem as apposite as the permissible translation adopted. CANTO INTRODUCTION TO THE INFERNO. THE\n\nTHREE\n\nBLESSED\n\nII T H E MISSION OF VIRGIL.\n\nLADIES.\n\nSPIRITUAL NATURE\n\nBEATRICE,\n\nMAN'S 14-\n\nI. The evening of Good Friday. 7. Invocation of the Muses, who represent the Arts and Sciences, upon a knowledge of which a poet must draw, as well as upon his own Genius and Memory. 13. Aeneas, who descended into Hades to get the help, which led to his conquest of Italy, and eventually to the glories of Imperial and Papal Rome. 28. Saint Paul, the Apostle to the Gentiles, who claimed to have been \" caught up into Paradise.\" 32. Cowardice on Dante's part disguised as Modesty. 43. Virgil, the Magnanimous, reproving him for his spiritual Pusilanimity, gives an account of his Mission from Beatrice, sent to Dante's help b y the Gentle L a d y (the Virgin Mary) and L u d a , the representatives, respectively, of Divine Mercy and Light. 52. The souls in the Limbo, or Borderland. 53. Beatrice, described with ever increasing emphasis throughout the poem as \" beautiful and happy,\" thus establishing the difference between her and Virgil, who is only learned and wise. 7 7. The circle referred to being that of the Moon, this new definition of Beatrice means that Man's spiritual, and not his rational, nature is what makes him greater than anything else on earth. 88.

Dante thought of Rachel as being Beatrice's counterpart in the symbolism of the Old Testament. 103. Beatrice defined as \" true Praise of God,\" which is not intellectual knowledge, but spiritual appreciation. 107. The river of Sin, which does not flow into the sea. 119. The materialistic Wolf. 124. God's Mercy, and Light, and His Spirit in Man. 131. Fearlessness and Freedom, here as elsewhere, the great spiritual qualities. 140. Virgil (Reason) accepted b y Dante as his Leader, Lord and Teacher, titles with which he addresses, or refers to, him appositely in each case. Herewith the two poets enter upon the rough road which leads them underground to the outer Gate of Hell. In this canto Man's three spiritual friends are contrasted with the three brutal enemies from which his Reason rescued him in Canto I, while Beatrice, who represents God's spirit in Man, is b y the poet identified in line 105, as frequently in the poem, with the historical Florentine girl, Beatrice Portinari, whom Dante had loved since his childhood, of whom he had written in his Vita Nuova, and to say of whom \" what had never been said of any woman \" he had prepared himself in every way ever since her death in 1290.

Inscription on the Gate, describing Hell as being a spiritual state, (in the letter of the allegory, a place) eternally created b y the Power, Wisdom, and even the Love of God, wherein Pain is the eternal concomitant of Disobedience of a Will inspired b y perfect Justice. 14. Fearlessness the initial quality requisite of whoever would know Reality. 17. The vision of God the real goal of Man's life. 22. The stars, here as elsewhere, the symbols of the Hope, abandoned b y whoever enters Hell. 34. Cowards, Neutrals, and the Lukewarm in moral and spiritual concerns, who, held in contempt b y the universe, are rejected by Heaven and Hell alike. The Lower World's Vestibule, its largest circle, is devoted to these characterless souls, who form the great majority. 52. The restless Flag of FasMon followed by those whose deeds, thoughts, feelings, and beliefs are not self-determined. £ XXV ]\n\nINTERPRETATIVE\n\nANALYSIS\n\n59- He \" who through his cowardice the great Refusal made,\" most satisfactorily (though not generally) interpreted as Pilate, who through fear of the Jews washed his hands of responsibility for the fate of Jesus, whose innocence he had officially acknowledged. Most commentators take him to be Celestine V, who was induced to abdicate the Papacy through humility by the fraudulent intrigues of his successor, Boniface VIII. 64. Never spiritually alive, they act only under external compulsion, while their blood and tears serve only to feed lower forms of life. 71. The river Acheron, crossed by all who, in willing sin, will its equivalent and inseparable punishment. 82. Charon, the Ferryman of Acheron, who refuses to receive Dante, because he is not, as are the others, spiritually dead. 93. The boat that takes repentant souls to the Island of Purgatory. 95. The password which prevails in the realm of Incontinence, where Reason, though neglected, is respected. 117. One of several references to the art of Falconry. 126. Not fearing the sin, they do not fear its punishment. 130. Under the symbolism of earthquake, wind, and lightning Dante describes his mysterious birth by a flash of intuition, as it were, into a first appreciation of the truth which pervades the whole of his Inferno, that any state of Sin is one with its accompanying, or equivalent Pain. While unconscious, hajpasses across Acheron, to see with his mind's eye what nonoDeaience and disobedience of the laws of the spiritual or real world mean in terms of pain. Of this, which is one of the strongest, though least frequently appreciated, cantos of the whole Inferno, the outstanding figure is the Pilate whom Dante, in contrast to the Cowards whom he \" recognized,\" \" knew \" at once, as unmistakably the greatest conceivable illustration of the despicable class, which does not understand that human tears, and even blood, are made sublime, when shed for a noble cause. CANTO\n\nIV\n\nT H E F I R S T CIRCLE. T H E LIMBO, OR BORDERLAND, OF U N BAPTIZED INNOCENTS AND WORTHIES, AND ILLUSTRIOUS PAGANS. VIRGIL. ARISTOTLE 38-49\n\n7. A first confused impression of the World of Evil. 21. Specially deserving of notice are the occasions when Virgil and Dante show £ XX v i\n\n]\n\nINTERPRETATIVE\n\nANALYSIS\n\nsympathy, or refuse it, for sinners in the lower world. 24. Dante's Hell is physically conceived as being a vast inverted cone extending from immediately below the surface of the earth to its centre, and divided into nine concentric and ever diminishing circles. 25. This outermost circle portrays the spiritual state of the innocent and worthy, but pagan-minded, who, not having attained the Christian conception of life, cannot, while in that state, share in its happiness, and who therefore, though desiring, have no hope. 52. The legend of Christ's descent into Hades, and His removal of the Hebrew Worthies who had believed in the Redemption that was to be — a conception probably based upon consciousness that spiritual apprehension of a truth is the essential saving thing. 68. The light surrounding these illustrious Pagans is only a hemisphere, because their loyalty to Reason was unquickened by spiritual faith. 72. Honor, the outstanding quality in this canto. 79. In spite of Homer's traditional supremacy, Dante probably thought of Virgil as \" the loftiest of poets,\" and hence, as such, greater, and better fitted to be his guide than Aristotle, \" the Teacher of those that know.\" 88. Homer and the three Latin poets whom, with Virgil, Dante thought the greatest of Antiquity, and whom he yet describes as \" neither sorrowful nor glad.\" 97. Dante received among them as an equal, a claim on his part more than confirmed by the verdict of posterity. 106. The Castle of Wisdom and Glory, with its seven walls, Prudence, Justice, Fortitude, Temperance, Intelligence, Learning, and Wisdom; its stream of Eloquence; and its gates, Grammar, Dialectics, Rhetoric, Music, Arithmetic, Geometry, and Astronomy, through which was entered the domain of Knowledge. 121. The military and political Heroes of the Trojan-Roman civilization, with the chivalric Saladin as the only representative of Mohamedanism. 130. Philosophers and men of Science, presided over by Aristotle, the \" Teacher of those that know.\" 139. The qualities of plants. 144. A commentary on Aristotle, followed by the great medieval theologian, Thomas Aquinas. 148. Dante here enters the real Hell of Sin and Pain, whose darkness is nowhere mitigated even by the half light of Reason. The picture of the negative punishment (?) of the paganminded in this canto should be understood as applying to the pagan-minded in modern and contemporary, as well as in ancient times. It is merely a poetical statement of an obvious and ac-\n\n£ xxvii\n\nINTERPRETATIVE\n\nANALYSIS\n\nknowledge«! fact. A materialistic or merely intellectualistic conception of life, necessarily involves a lack of happiness open o n l y to those who can accept the joyous Christian view of life. T h e fate of individuals in \" another world \" is, in this case as in all others, on the knees of a Justice whose other name is L o v e , to which can be also left the little children w h o m D a n t e describes as being in the border state. M o s t texts read in line 36, parte, \" a p a r t , \" instead of porta, \" g a t e w a y , \" which latter, however, best describes the symbolic function of baptism.

As, in descending, the circles grow narrower, the sins t h e y rev e a l a n d the pain the latter involve are conceived as growing in intensity. 4. Minos, the classic Judge of the D e a d , is grotesqued b y D a n t e , and made the symbol of M a n ' s g u i l t y Conscience. 12. H i s tail is with grim humor conceived as long enough t o girdle him eight times. 19. A suggestion of the danger of contamination in an unguarded examination of Sin. 27. Contrasting with the sighs of the first Circle. 28. Carnal sinners in general; their punishment being merely a picture of their sin, t h e y are swept around in the dark b y the aimless winds of sexual passion uncontrolled b y Reason. 36. B l a m i n g God, or others, and not themselves, characteristic of those held in Hell. 40. T w o more pictures from bird life. 44. N o rest in disloyal love. 52. Semiramis leads those who sinned through brutal lasciviousness, or incest. 59. For the usual text succedette \" succeeded,\" the variant sugger dette, \" g a v e suck t o , \" has here been boldly substituted, as being significant, more Dante-like, and in perfect harmony with the context. 61. I n marked contrast with Semiramis, D i d o of Carthage, who, faithless to her plighted l o y a l t y to her dead husband, g a v e herself to Aeneas, leads those w h o w e a k l y yielded t o a genuine, though illegal, love for one person. 69. L o v e characterizes this canto as much as Honor the last. 72. D a n t e ' s bestowal or refusal of s y m p a t h y differentiates sins springing from good nature from those caused b y meanness or ill £ xxviii 3\n\nINTERPRETATIVE\n\nANALYSIS\n\nwill. 73. The pitiful story of Francesca da Rimini and Paolo Malatesta, which has made its fifth canto one of the most popular of the Inferno, is treated b y Dante with his utmost poetic «¿arm and sympathy, because though sinful, theirs was the sin of a genuine love. 81. God's name is not used b y any one speaking in Hell, except in a case of defiance. 87. Love answers love. 97. Ravenna. 100. Noteworthy is the contrast between the love of the man and that of the woman. 103. When found together, Francesca and Paolo were killed, without a chance of repentance, b y her husband, Gianciotto Malatesta, lord of Rimini. 107. The legally justified, but treacherous and murderous husband is here condemned to Caina, Cain's ring in the ice of Cocytus reserved for traitors to their relatives at the bottom of Hell. 123. T h e Italian dottore is best taken here, as above, as meaning not teacher, but leader. 124. A reference to Virgil's previous happiness on earth, or to his having in the Aeneid made Aeneas say to Dido: \" Thou bidst me, Queen, recall grief unspeakable.\" 127. T h e Arthurian legends were the favorite reading of the nobility then. 137. Sir Gallehault, the go-between in the case of Sir Launcelot and Queen Guinevere. 139. Dante's sympathy not reproved here b y Virgil, as it will be on another occasion. With this circle Dante enters upon the first of the three main parts of Hell, that of Incontinence, or Intemperance, which deals with four sins due to a lack of rational control over necessary human appetites, upon whose use depend the birth, the physical nourishment of individuals, and the development of Man's material, and moral civilization. M a n y scholars think that the del costui piacer of line 104 should be taken to mean \" for his charming looks,\" but, apart from the involved lack of contrast with line 101, line 103 seems to suggest as more correct the version given in the text.\n\nCANTO T H E THIRD CIRCLE.\n\nVI\n\nT H E H E L L OF INCONTINENCE.\n\nTEMPERANCE IN THE USE OF FOOD. TONS.\n\nCIACCO\n\nCERBERUS.\n\nIN-\n\nGLUT62\n\nι . Dante's frequently mysterious passage from one circle or spiritual state to another resembles the mysterious w a y in which the [ xxix 3\n\nINTERPRETATIVE\n\nANALYSIS\n\nmind shuts out a previous thought or feeling by an act of will, and gives itself wholly to another. 7. The cold and dirty rain in which the Gluttons are submerged, and the three-mouthed monster, Cerberus, who torments them, represent their disgusting abuse of the natural and necessary appetite for Food. 21. Profaners of their body, the temple of the spirit. 38. Ciacco, Jimmy, the pig, apparently the twofold nickname of a clever, goodnatured Florentine glutton in Dante's time. T o the \" empty shades \" of spirits in Hell, Dante attributes the power of being seen, heard, and touched, but without solidity. 42. Dante was born before Ciacco had died. 48. Dante had not yet seen some of the lower circles. 58. Sympathy, because gluttony and the like are sins to which the social and good-natured are peculiarly tempted. 64. The political vicissitudes of Florence after 1300, the date of Dante's Vision. The Bianchi and Neri are the factions referred to. The Neri were driven out in 1301 by the Bianchi, who in turn were exiled in 1302 (and with them Dante) largely as a result of the intrigues of Boniface VIII, who in 1300 was \" hugging the shore,\" or \" on the fence.\" The poem having been written at different times later than its feigned date, historical events posterior to 1300 are, as here, narrated in the form of prophecies. Three suns are three years. 73. Of the two just men in Florence, it is quite like Dante to have had himself in mind as one. 74. Peculiarly noteworthy are the three sparks, \" overweening Pride, Envy, and Greed,\" which were the cause of trouble in the limited sphere of Florence six centuries ago! 79. Illustrious citizens of Florence, whom Dante respected for their civic virtues, but whom he will see lower down in Hell, because of their personal sins. 86. Punishment in Hell is graded by a law of spiritual gravitation. 89. Almost all sinners wish to be remembered on earth, except traitors, who have wholly broken the social bond. 96. Christ at the Final Judgment. Men are justly judged by a comparison of their lives with that of the moral and spiritual Record-holder of the race. 106. Man's spirit being thought to be wholly itself only when embodied, it follows that when reëmbodied its happiness or unhappiness will be more keenly felt. 115. Gluttony suddenly vanishing from Dante's mind, he sees before him the symbol of Intemperance in the Use of Wealth, Plutus, Man's great enemy.\n\n[ XXX\n\n]\n\nINTERPRETATIVE\n\nANALYSIS\n\nIn view of the Italian people's well known temperance in the use of wine, etc., it is interesting to note that it did not occur to Dante to mention intoxication in this canto, or anywhere in the Inferno, except in the case of Pope Boniface V I I I . ( x x v n , 99.) While no one this side of the experience can know what a \" future life \" will be like, one can imagine that it will involve a fuller consciousness of the eternity in which one is already living in this life, and of which one is at times aware.\n\nCANTO T H E FOURTH CIRCLE.\n\nVII\n\nT H E H E L L o r INCONTINENCE.\n\nTEMPERANCE IN THE USE OE WEALTH. PLUTUS. AND PRODIGALS.\n\nFORTUNE\n\nIN-\n\nMISERS 72\n\nι . What it was probably intended to be, incomprehensible jargon, or a clucked out appeal to Satan. 3. Another definition of Virgil. 6. M a n will ultimately solve the problems presented b y Wealth. 8. T h e moiister Plutus being called a Wolf would seem to strengthen the interpretation, whereby the Wolf of the first canto stood for materialistic Greed, born of E n v y , the child of Pride, a view enforced b y the following reference to Michael's defeat of Satan's rebellion against a spiritual God. 19. I t is because of the perfection of Divine Justice that sin is self-punished. 22. Misers and Prodigals represented as wasting their lives in selfishly amassing and holding, or in squandering Wealth; Abuse and Nonuse, here, as elsewhere in the realm of Incontinence, being opposed to rational Use. Charybdis in the Strait of Messina. 39. Avarice a besetting sin of churchmen in Dante's age. 46. Dante sees Emperors and Ghibellines in Hell, as well as Popes and Guelphs. 52. Dante uses unrecognizability to describe sins which result in, or are due to, lack of character. 59. Avarice and Prodigality mutually punishing each other. 74. Mediaeval mythology conceived of Angels and Intelligences in somewhat the same way that Laws are conceived of in the intellectual mythology of modern Science. 77. Fortune is thought of as the personification of the law controlling the waxing and waning of the prosperity of individuals, families, nations, and races. 87. Gods, Angels, and Laws are all mythological attempts to express observed correlations in Nature. 93. A s when she is blamed as\n\n[ xxxi]\n\nINTERPRETATIVE ANALYSIS Luck, or worse. 98. This means, in the language of the stars, whose positions Virgil sees in his mind, that it is now past midnight, over six hours since the evening of Good Friday, when the poets entered Hell. Judging from a hint dropped in line 25, Dante deemed that man's wrong attitude toward wealth — which he thought of as an outer body, upon the proper use of which material civilization's interests depended — was the most prevalent of all the sins in Hell. In this connection the symbolic Wolf of materialistic Greed is brought in, not in her own capacity as representing malicious Fraud, but as \" mated \" to Incontinence. THE FIFTH CIRCLE. THE HELL OF INCONTINENCE. INTEMPERANCE IN INDIGNATION. THE WRATHFUL AND SULLEN. STYX 78-81 101. This is the overflow of Acheron, since Dante conceives of all the rivers of his Hell as interconnected. 106. Styx, the marshy river, or fen, which with its banks forms the Fifth Circle. 109. The Wrathful and the indolent Sullen, who, by abuse or nonuse, failed în the rational use of that natural Indignation, upon which the higher interests of Man's civilization as much depend, as the lower do upon the rational use of Wealth. 116. Not the angry, but \" those whom anger overcame.\" 118. Those who have not character enough to have the courage to voice their convictions, and fight for them like men.

Phlegyas, the wrathful local boatman of Styx, blinded by anger, does not see as clearly as Charon did. 27. The effect of Dante's material body on Phlegyas' boat is used as a means of reminding the reader that Dante is the only living being in the poem. 32. Filippo, nicknamed Argenti (Silver), 'an arrogant and irascible Florentine of the Adimari family. 37. No sympathy for ill-natured sinners. 43. In Virgil's approval of his righteous indignation Dante makes the only men-\n\n£ xxxii []\n\nINTERPRETATIVE\n\nANALYSIS\n\ntion in the poem of a member of his immediate family. 66. \"Sbarro,\" \"unbar,\" one of Dante's many rhyme words which lend lucidity to his thought. 68. The City of Dis, or Nether Hell, which contains the realms of Bestiality and Malice, classes of Sin far worse than Incontinence. 71. Mosques, possibly to suggest the Heresy just inside, Mohammedanism being thought to be as heretical as it was schismatic. T H E G A T E OF THE CITY OF D I S (SATAN)\n\n88-91\n\n82. The Devils, or demons of Biblical mythology, being the guardians of the irrational domain of Bestiality, are naturally inaccessible to the claims of Virgil, or Reason. 105. Virgil's ultimate dependence upon Beatrice is suggestive of that of Art and Science upon Inspiration and Intuition. 125. Reference to the legend of Christ's Descent to Hades, and of the Devils' opposition to His entrance. 128. Reason undivorced from Spirituality is sure of receiving the help of Inspiration or Intuition, when at the end of its natural resources.

B y his use of the past tense Dante seemed to have implied that Guido was dead. 79. Proserpine, the Queen of Hades, identified with Luna, the Moon; in less than fifty moons, or months, from April, 1300, Dante found himself banished from Florence, never to return. 85. The Battle of Mont' Aperti, on the river Arbia, won in 1260 b y the Ghibelline forces under the leadership of Farinata, over the Guelphs of Florence. 87. Perpetual banishment from Florence decreed b y the returning Guelphs against the Uberti family. 91. The Ghibelline Diet of Empoli, which followed the victory of Mont'Aperti. 97. Knowledge of the Present depends upon life in Time; that of the Future upon life in Eternity, remote events of a general nature depending predominantly upon moral and spiritual forces. 109. Again, sympathy for the man, and not for the sinner, as such. 119. The Hohenstaufen Emperor, Frederick II, whom Dante greatly admired, but condemned to be seen here for the heretical beliefs he shared with his contemporary Cardinal degli Ubaldini. 122. Farinata's prophecy of Dante's exile. 130. The meaning of the vicissitudes of Dante's (Man's) life not to be explained b y Reason (Virgil), but b y Spiritual Insight, the Beatrice who does not know intellectually, but \" whose lovely eyes see \" b y a direct vision of spiritual Reality. One of the most significant definitions of Beatrice in the poem, for if Religion had always understood that it was exclusively concerned with Man's conquest of the eternal world of spiritual reality; and had Science remembered that its sole function is the conquest of the spatial and temporal world of matter, there would have been no more \" conflict \" between them than there is between Virgil and Beatrice in our poem.\n\nCANTO\n\nTHE SIXTH CIRCLE (continued).\n\nXI\n\nTHE DISTRIBUTION, OR\n\nETHICAL CLASSIFICATION OF THE DAMNED\n\n.\n\n.\n\n.\n\n116-\n\n5.

He who would know the inmost nature of evil must be willing to get used to its repulsiveness. 17. The Seventh, Eighth, and Ninth Circles, small only in relation to the first six. 22. The following analysis is based upon Dante's interpretation of Aristotle's classification of sins under Incontinence (Intemperance), Bestiality and Malice, wherein Reason is, respectively, neglected, defied, or wrongly used. 25. Creatures lower than Man would not have sufficient intelligence, while any presumed to be higher would have too much, to make deceit effective. 28. The first of the last three. 29. The three persons are one's own self, one's fellow self, and the Universal Self. 33. Dante treats property as an outermost body of Man's spirit. 43. A fine definition of a suicide; not one who kills himself, but a spirit who kills his own body. 44. Wasting one's property, and pessimism, outer forms of suicide. 48. Respect for Nature, which is an outer manifestation of God, associated with reverence for the latter. 50. Sodom here stands for unnatural sexual sins, while Cahors, in France, in the middle age a nest of usurers, stands for Usury, conceived as sin against Industry. 57. The second of the last three Circles. 60. Stigmatized as \" filth \" are Evil Counsellors, and Promoters of Discord. 61. Treachery. 64. The Ninth Circle, the frozen lake of Cocytus, at whose center Dis, or Lucifer, is fixed. 66. Here, and elsewhere in the poem, eternally and eternal should be given a deeper significance than endlessness in Time, or something more like perfect, or absolute; Dante's Lucifer represents the zero-stage of life. 70. The Wrathful and Sullen in Styx, the Carnal Sinners, the Gluttons, and the Misers and Prodigals. 80, 97, 101. The Ethics, Philosophy, and Physics referred to are those of Aristotle. 103. Man's Industry is patterned after the operations of Nature. 109. Dante condemns Usury because it is contrary to God's law that Man shall live \" in the sweat of his face,\" and because he believed it opposed to the interests of Industry, Man's Art; the Usurer getting his living from neither Nature or his own toil. 113. Astronomical data signifying that the time is now about half past three A.M. on Saturday. Caurus, the Northwest wind, shows the Wain's or Dipper's position in the sky.

Christ, who when in Hades removed from the Limbo the believing Worthies of the Old Dispensation. 41. The earthquake at Jesus' death, which, breaking open the outer Gate of Hell, furnished access to the Circle of Violence; the whole myth symbolizing the insight into Evil resulting from the life and death of Jesus. 43. Reference to the doctrine of Empedocles, who taught that Love restored to a happy Chaos the seeds of things that had been separated by Hate. 52. Phlegethon, the river of Blood, guarded by the semi-human Centaurs, symbols of human Brutality. 67. Wounded by a poisoned arrow by Hercules for trying to carry off Dejanira, Nessus left his shirt which, being poisoned, killed Hercules. 75. Sin self-punished. 77. One of countless touches of convincing realism. 84. The human and the equine. 88. Beatrice, already defined as being herself the \" true Praise of God, which is spiritual appreciation, and not intellectual understanding or servile flattery, of Him. 103. Tyrants, or wholesale slaughterers like Attila, the Hun, the most deeply immersed in the Blood of Phlegethon. 109. Italian thirteenth-century tyrants. 114. Nessus is put temporarily in charge of Dante, as being the local expert. 116. Murderers. 118. Guy de Montfort, who during Mass (\" God's bosom \") at Viterbo killed Prince Henry E xxxvii\n\nINTERPRETATIVE\n\nANALYSIS\n\nof England, whose heart King Edward I brought home, and buried in a shrine on London Bridge. 135.

A river and a town which bound the wild district of the Tuscan Maremma. 10. The Harpies, symbols of remorse and fear of the future, feed on bushes, to which are reduced the spirits of those who deprived themselves of human bodies. 21. Things unbelievable, if merely narrated. 37. Suicide, either b y the killing of the body or by inaction, is here pictured as essentially vegetating, a self-lowering in the scale of life. 45. The perfection of psychological description. 48. A similar wonder told b y Virgil in the Aeneid about Polydorus. 58. Pier delle Vigne, a Chancellor of Frederick II, who, according to Dante here, was unjustly accused of treachery, and took his own life in prison. 64. E n v y . 68. Frederick II. 75. It is only as an illustration of the significance of Heresy that Dante sees him in the Sixth Circle. 84. Sympathy again unreproved. 94. The state of Suicides before and after the Final Judgment; the life of the body, of which the spirit of the suicide deprives himself, is considered as an instrument for the building of character for which he is responsible. 96. The suicide's own conscience. 115. Those who were violent against their property, which Dante considered as an outer body, for which a spirit is also responsible. 118. Lano da Siena, and Giacomo da Sant' Andrea, two thirteenth-century Italians famous as squanderers of their means. 121. Lano died in the battle of Pieve del Toppo, won in 1289 b y the Aretines against the Sienese. 125. The Spendthrifts' creditors. 143. Florence, whose patron Saint was John the Baptist, had been in its more warlike, and less commercial, Pagan times under the protection of Mars, a part of whose statue was said to have been set on the Ponte Vecchio, after the legendary destruction of Florence\n\n[ xxxviii ]\n\nINTERPRETATIVE\n\nANALYSIS\n\nb y Attila. The whole passage is a warning to any people, which, in its eagerness for commercial prosperity, risks losing the military qualities which alone would enable them to keep it. 151.

Bitterly as Dante at times inveighed against Florence for her vices and ingratitude, no man ever loved his native place more tenderly and proudly than did Dante. 8. The Plain of burning sand on which nothing will grow, finely symbolizes sins against spiritual, human, and social growth. 15. The Libyan desert crossed b y Cato of Utica with the remnants of Pompey's army. 16. God's Vengeance consists in causing sins to contain the seed of their own punishment. 22. Those prostrate on the ground are the violent against God directly; those seated without doing anything the violent against Industry, the economic art; and those restlessly running around with no results the violent against the procreative laws of Nature in Man. 28. The Rain of Fire, the symbol of God's Wrath. 31. A n Alexandrian legend probably the result of blending two experiences, one of a heavy snow fall, and the other of torrid heat. 44. Reason reminded of its limitations. 49. Capaneus, one of the famous seven kings who fought against Thebes; he was killed with a thunderbolt hurled b y Zeus, whom he had arrogantly defied. This is the Dante character which most resembles the Satan of Milton. 52. Vulcan, who had his smithy in Mongibello, M t . Aetna. 58. Phlegra, in Thessaly, the site of the mythical struggle between Zeus and the Giants, the Sky-god and the Sons of Earth, Spirit and Matter. 65. Capaneus' blasphemous rage its own punishment. 77. The overflow of Phlegethon. 79. A pond of boiling mineral water near Viterbo. 88. This brook is peculiarly notable possibly because the fact that the flames falling upon the third ring which it crosses, are extinguished above it, shows that the punishment of one sin cannot extend to another; the overflow of Phlegethon is still a part of\n\n[] x x x i x j]\n\nINTERPRETATIVE\n\nANALYSIS\n\nthe first ring. 94. The classic myth of the origin of Man in the island of Crete, and of the Golden Age under Saturn, whose wife, Rhea, secured the survival of Jupiter, b y substituting a stone for him at his birth, thus concealing him from his father who would else have devoured him, because the Fates had declared that he would be dethroned b y a son. T h e truth of this myth may consist in the fact that while there is only one God, conceptions of Him are continually dethroning each other in turn. The Hebraic Garden of Eden myth is saved b y Dante for use in the Terrestrial Paradise at the top of Mount Purgatory. 103. The Old M a n of Crete, the symbol of the ever deteriorating human race, whose tears furnish Hell with its rivers; Damietta, in Egypt, represents the ancient world of Man before the age of Imperial and Christian Rome. 126. In the Inferno the two poets, when not going down toward the center, regularly turn to the left around an arc of each circle, thus following the course of the sun. 130. Phlegethon means, in Greek, boiling; Lethe, the other infernal river of classic mythology, Dante saves for a higher purpose in the Terrestrial Paradise. 139. Another of countless instances of the way Dante makes his reader feel the concrete realism of the story with which he has clothed his Allegory; a definite time is allotted to each part of his journey.

The stone embankments protecting the overflow of Phlegethon compared to the Belgian dykes, and to the embankments along the river Brenta erected to meet the freshets from the Chiarentana mountains, both of which human constructions are declared to be larger than those in Hell; a realistic and masterly touch of selfrestraint on Dante's part. 16. A band of Sodomites who were famous literary men. 22. Brunetto Latini, a distinguished Florentine Guelph, a statesman and writer, and author of Li Livres dou Trésor (Tesoro) an allegoric didactic poem written in French. He probably helped Dante in his studies, and died in 1294. 30. Dante uses the specially polite voi in addressing Brunetto, as he did in the case of Farinata and Cavalcanti. 45. Reverence for [XL]\n\nINTERPRETATIVE\n\nANALYSIS\n\nthe man, unaffected by condemnation of the sin he illustrated. 54. Not Italy, but Heaven. 55. Dante's astrological \" s t a r \" (unless his natural disposition be intended) was the constellation of Gemini, the Twins, in which the Sun was at the date of his birth, some unknown day in May or June, 1265; this was supposed to be a prognostic of literary ability. 61. Dante believed himself descended from the original Roman stock of Florence, and not from the alien element which later came into it from the older and rougher mountain town of Fiesole. 68. Again the Greed, the Envy and the overweening Pride ! 70. One of the many passages in the poem which testify to Dante's firm belief in his future fame, in spite of his rejection by his fellow Florentines. 79. Dante's deep sympathy for Brunetto here and in what follows shows that he impartially put his friends, as well as his enemies, in Hell. 85. One of the greatest tributes ever paid a teacher by his pupil. 89. Those of Ciacco and Farinata. 90. Beatrice. 99. Reason's approval of Dante's fearless attitude toward the impersonal vagaries of Fortune. 109. Priscian, a celebrated grammarian of the early sixth century; Francesco d'Accorso, a professor of law at Oxford and Bologna late in the thirteenth. 112. A bishop of Florence (on the Arno) transferred to Vicenza (on the Bacchigliene), by Pope Boniface VIII, to whom Dante here gives his humblest title, Servus servorum Dei, ironically. 122. A popular foot race at Verona, instituted in 1207, and still held in Dante's time; a piece of green cloth was the prize contended for.\n\nCANTO\n\nXVI\n\nT H E SEVENTH CIRCLE {continued).

The waterfall of Phlegethon. 8. Dante wore the toga, a tradition from Roman times, to which he was ever proudly loyal. 15. Another strong instance of respect for the general character of individuals independent of a searching condemnation of the sin which they served to illustrate. 21. A scheme by which the three could keep moving, and yet converse with Dante. 26. The text here adopted is granted to be in every way the best, but is\n\nINTERPRETATIVE\n\nANALYSIS\n\ngenerally rejected on documentary grounds. 34. Three illustrious Florentines: Guido Guerra, of the Conti Guidi, a leader of the Guelphs of Florence; Tegghiaio Aldobrandi, whose warning, if heeded, would have saved the Florentine Guelphs the defeat of Mont'Aperti; Jacopo Rusticucci, an honored Florentine, apparently plagued by a shrewish wife; all three contemporaries of Dante's father. 6r. A compendium of Dante's journey through the spiritual world. 73. A wonderfully succinct account of the causes of the troubled state of Florence in Dante's time, which throws light upon the history of the United States since the Civil War — undigested Wealth, and undigested Immigration. 78. \" As one looks at truth! \" 88. Just such a hurriedly uttered Amen can still be heard in the rendering of the Latin liturgy in Florence! 92. Phlegethon, falling over the edge of the Seventh Circle into the profound abyss below to form the frozen lake of Cocytus at the bottom of Hell. Bloodthirstiness ultimately results in utterly cold-hearted Treachery. 94. The stream which at Forlì takes the name of Montone, and in Dante's time flowed into the Adriatic, without becoming a tributary of the Po, as did all others on the northern slope of the Apennines, from the Po's source in the Cottian Alps eastward. 100. A monastery rich enough to have accommodated more monks than it did. It is possible, however, to translate the passage: \" because of falling o'er one ledge, when by a thousand it should be received.\" 106. Thought to be the cord of St. Francis, Dante being reported as having intended in his youth to join the Franciscan order, as a means of resisting the temptations to Incontinence, represented by the allegorical Leopard of the first canto. 118. Virgil could read Dante's mind. 122. Geryon's appearance not a surprise to Dante. 124. An anticipation of Browning's teaching in the Ring and the Book, X I I , 845-857. Telling unfamiliar as well as unpopular truths is fraught with danger, but Dante dared to face it here. The dangerous truth is, that the cord of St. Francis actually brought up Geryon, the symbol of Fraud. Now Dante loved St. Francis, but, aware as he was of the degeneracy of his order, his own experience may have caused him to realize that joining an organization did not in itself accomplish what must be achieved by one's own will. The cord itself had in Dante's time become too frequently a symbol of Fraud, and so could attract Geryon. Hereafter Dante will wear no girdle but the reed of humility, assumed at the beginning\n\n[xlii]\n\nINTERPRETATIVE\n\nANALYSIS\n\nof his course through Purgatory. 128. His Comedy, to which \" both Heaven and earth had set their hand,\" was to Dante as sacred as anything he could swear by. 133. A diver. The usual form of the text of lines 26, 27 refered to above, \" in contrario il collo faceva a' piè continuo viaggio; \" is rythmically forced, and makes the neck travel instead of the feet.\n\nCANTO\n\nTHE SEVENTH VIOLENCE\n\nCIRCLE AGAINST\n\nXVII\n\n{continued). ART\n\nTHE\n\n(INDUSTRY).\n\nGERYON\n\nTHIRD\n\nRING.\n\nUSURERS. 184-\n\nI. Geryon, the symbol of Fraud, whose nature will be revealed b y the punishment of its several forms in the following Circle. 1 7 21. A marvelous selection of illustrations of Fraud! Arachne, a Lydian maiden who challenged Athene to weaving, and was turned b y her into a spider. 31. T h e y had to go to the right to avoid crossing the stream of blood; ten paces means a few. 34. Usurers; Usury being of all forms of violence the nearest to Fraud, they are next to the Abyss. 39. T o understand the evil of Usury Dante does not need to be accompanied b y Virgil. 45. Making money work for them, the usurers are represented as seated, with nothing to do but \" avail themselves of the market,\" and make money — spiritually a \" melancholy \" job. 49. One of several little instances in the poem of Dante's grim sense of humor. 54. Being without character, which is inseparable from personal distinction, these usurers are distinguishable only b y means of the money bags hanging from their necks, and hence, except in financial circles, are of no account. 59. The devices on the bags are the coats of arms of prominent Florentine and Paduan usurers. 72. Giovanni Buiamonte, said to have been the most infamous usurer in Europe in Dante's time. 82. Hereafter the two poets can no longer descend from one Circle to another on foot; here, only b y consenting to accept the help of Fraud itself in the person of Geryon, can insight into Fraud be acquired; but Man, in so doing, must be sure to let Reason sit between him and Fraud's sting. 107. Phaëthon, the son of Apollo, who, misguiding the chariot of the Sun, burned the skies and produced the Milky W a y . 109. Icarus, the son of the inventor Daedalus, the mythical\n\n[ xliii ]\n\nINTERPRETATIVE\n\nANALYSIS\n\nfounder of aëronautics. 122. The punishments of the Eighth Circle, which they are approaching. 127. Another simile drawn from the art of Falconry; Geryon had only grudgingly performed the service imposed on him by Virgil. The dominant figure of this canto is that of Geryon, the wonderfully drawn symbol of Fraud, the sin of perverted Reason, which is described as stronger by far than all defensive or offensive armor, and as spiritually the most foully corruptive of all classes of sin. Recalling the fact that one is now in the domain of the Wolf of fraudulent Greed, Dante's method of handling it reminds one of the Gospel teaching that when \" in the midst of wolves \" one should be as \" wise as serpents \" while remaining as \"harmless as doves.\" Until civilization comes to realize that Fraud is, as Dante here teaches, morally and spiritually more deleterious to man than any form of Incontinence, such as even drunkenness, or than any kind of Violence, such as even murder, little real ethical progress will be made.\n\nCANTO\n\nXVIII\n\nT H E EIGHTH CIRCLE.

Pandars, pimps, or professional procurers of women, driven around the trench by devils armed with scourges, who represent the mean passions which restlessly goad them on to fraud. 25. Dante uses nakedness here and elsewhere to portray sins that are peculiarly indefensible. 27. The second band were moving faster than were the walking poets. 28. Immense crowds of pilgrims from all over Europe gathered at Rome for the Jubilee of 1300; Dante may himself have been there, and witnessed what he describes. 3 1 . The Castle of Sant' Angelo; the mountain opposite is Giordano. 49. A Bolognese, who for money is said to have betrayed his own sister to the lust of a Marquis da Esti of [xliv]\n\nINTERPRETATIVE\n\nANALYSIS\n\nFerrara. 51. A grim play upon the word salse, sauces, a name given to a place near Bologna, where the bodies of criminals were thrown. 61. In Bologna, which lies between the rivers Savena and Reno, sipa used to be the dialectic form of si, yes. 76. Seducers of women, scourged around the trench in the opposite direction. 83. Jason, the royal leader of the Argonauts in their quest of the Golden Fleece of Colchos, and the seducer of Hypsipyle, Medea and other women. 90. Because, ever since cursed b y Venus, they had been abandoned b y their husbands. In the general massacre Hypsipyle had saved her father, King Thoas. THE EIGHTH CIRCLE (continued). THE SECOND TRENCH. FLATTERERS AND PROSTITUTES. INTEKSHNEI. THAIS 204-207 100. Here Flatterers and Prostitutes, viewed as men and women who, for personal advantage of one kind or another, prostituted their souls or their bodies b y playing with friendship, affection, admiration, or love, are immersed in excrement, to signify the utterly disgusting and corrupt nature of their sin morally and spiritually; the boldest instance of Dante's unflinching realism. 122. A contemporary of Dante, of whom little else is known. 130. The famous Athenian courtesan, said to have been the mistress of Alexander. Whatever prostitution may be from other points of view, physical or ethical, Dante's marvelous insight saw that it was spiritually poisonous, because essentially the most corrupting form of Flattery.\n\nCANTO\n\nXIX\n\nTHE EIGHTH CIRCLE. THE HELL OF MALICE. FRAUD. THE THIRD TRENCH. SIMONIACS, SPIRITUAL PROSTITUTES. NICHOLAS I I I . BONIFACE V I I I . CLEMENT V . . 208-219 ι . Simon Magus, the magician who offered to pay St. Peter for spiritual gifts, the prototype of all who have been corrupt in the conduct of the Church's organization, b y buying or selling its offices, or by setting a monetary value on its spiritual gifts. In so far as Universities share with the Church in the same high field of spiritual responsibility for Man's .higher nature, they have been, and are, open to the same temptation. 10. The perfect Justice\n\n[xlv]\n\nINTERPRETATIVE ANALYSIS of God, whereby sin is its own punishment, illustrated throughout the Inferno, as virtue being its own reward is throughout the Paradiso. 17. The baptismal font in what was Dante's church, now the baptistery, in Florence, had four round wells around its central water basin, in which the baptizing priests stood, protected from the crowd bringing recently born children on special baptismal occasions. Dante, having once had to break one of these to release a child choking in it, is believed to be here defending himself against a charge of sacrilege. 28. The Simoniacs, having subjected their spiritual gifts, symbolized by the tongues of fire which rested on the Apostles' heads at Pentecost, to lower material interests, are here seen symbolically upside down with their heads in the earth, and with flames torturing the soles of their feet. Prostitution again! 49. Dante, as one of the six priors of Florence in the summer of 1300, may have been present officially at the execution of assassins for money, who were condemned to be planted head down in a hole dug in the ground. 52. Pope Nicholas III, who here mistakes Dante for Boniface VIII, still living, and equally guilty of simony. This is one of Dante's devices, whereby he is enabled to condemn to Hell one who in 1300, the date of his poem's Vision, not having yet died, could not be seen there. 56. Boniface VIII was believed to have ascended the Papal throne as the result of deceitful intrigues, ending in the abdication of Celestine V, mistakenly identified, some think, with \" him who through his cowardice the great Refusal made.\" 70. Nicholas III belonged to the great Roman Orsini (Bear) family. 75. Having changed their allegiance from Spirit to Matter, their destiny is to disappear from the real world into the earth. 82. Clement V, of Bordeaux, who was to follow Boniface soon after his death in 1303, was a creature of Philip the Fair of France, as the High Priest Jason had been that of Antiochus of Syria. 99. Charles I of Anjou, to whom Nicholas was opposed. 100. In spite of his bitter attacks upon several Popes, notably Boniface VIII, for their corruption, Dante was always most loyal to the ideally great conception of the Pope's office as Head of a united Christian Church. 106. Dante here attributes to Papal Rome in its corruption what the author of the Apocalypse probably ascribed to Pagan Rome. 109. This probably means that the Church had prospered, or would prosper, only so long as her head, the Pope, remembered that she was born of the seven gifts\n\n[xlvi]\n\nINTERPRETATIVE\n\nANALYSIS\n\nof the Holy Spirit, and observed the ten moral commandments. 115. One of the most famous passages in the Inferno, and one capable of the widest range of application. Dante shared in the erroneous belief of his age that Constantine had abandoned Rome, and even the Empire of the West, to the Popes to rule therein as temporal sovereigns. The spiritual truth may, however, be disengaged from it that for spiritual institutions excessive or hampering material endowments are fraught with the danger of degeneration and loss of freedom. 121. Again Virgil approves of Dante's fearless expression of a righteous indignation.\n\nCANTO T H E EIGHTH CIRCLE. FOURTH TRENCH. TICERS OF MAGIC.\n\nXX\n\nT H E H E L L OF MALICE.\n\nFRAUD.\n\nTHE\n\nDIVINERS, SOOTHSAYERS AND PRACMANTO\n\n220-229\n\nι . From time to time Dante will incidentally suggest the care with which he had planned out the symmetrical balance of the component parts of his work. In fact, in what poem in universal literature has the architecture of the Divine Comedy been surpassed or equalled ? 7. The sinners in this trench, if supposed to have seen into the future, have turned it into a past. This is described by their punishment — a mere picture of the real nature of their sin — which consists in walking ahead with their faces turned completely around, what they see being thus a past over which they have no creative control. Dante hereby suggests that man is a co-creator with God, and that the spiritual future being yet uncreated b y their free cooperation, cannot be known. 27. This is in Italian a play upon the double meaning of the word pietà, piety and pity. Dante, being here concerned for the fate of no individual sinner, is reproved b y Virgil for what here seems his sympathy with the sin, to separate which from its equivalent punishment would be as irrational, as it would be to wish any physical or logical law to be other than what it is. 31, 40, 46. Amphiaraus, a diviner, one of the seven Kings who besieged Thebes; Tiresias and Aruns also diviners; all three known to classic lore. 48. Great Italian marble quarries northwest of Pisa. 52. With Manto Dante reaches a case peculiarly interesting to him, because she was the fabled foundress of Mantua in Lombardy, the home [ xlvii ]\n\nINTERPRETATIVE\n\nANALYSIS\n\nof his teacher Virgil. 59· A reference to the fall of Thebes, the birthplace of the god, Bacchus, under the tyranny of Creon. 61. One of Dante's most graceful bits of Italian geography, with its expression of the inveterate Latin feeling that the greater function of the highest Alps is to keep Germany and her traditional Barbarians out of the \" Garden of the Empire,\" as he calls Italy in the Purgatorio. 67. Trento, as well as Brescia and Verona, an Italian city. 78. Govemolo, the modern form of Governo. 94. A reference to internal Ghibelline-Guelph dissensions in Mantua, which resulted in a decrease of the city in population and importance. 97. Dante here, for some unknown reason preferred this version of the origin of Mantua to one given by Virgil in the Aeneid. Not being history, a later version of a legend may well be better than an earlier one. 103. \" B u t . . . ! \" 106. Soothsayers connected with the story of Troy, and the sailing of the Greeks from Aulis. 115. Michael Scot, a famous Scotch thirteenth-century physician and astrologer, reputed a magician. 118. Italian necromancers, and women who won for themselves the dangerous name of witches. 124. Cain and his thorns, a popular Italian version of the Man in the Moon; an astronomical bit indicating that it is now about 6 A.M.\n\nCANTO\n\nXXI\n\nT H E EIGHTH CIRCLE.

Though the name Commedia was in Dante's time that given to serious poetic compositions that ended well, and so befits Dante's supreme poem, which ends happily in Paradise, the nature of this and of the following canto is such that Comedy in the modern sense would perfectly apply to them. Corruption in politics, and the endless struggle between corrupt representatives of the people and often equally corrupt executives of the laws passed against that corruption, have always been fair game for more or less good natured amusement, cartooning, etc. True to his nature as a great artist, Dante in dealing with the subject at once descends in incident and language to the natural level of the comedy of the perennial political tragedy, so that any criticism from the point\n\nxlviii\n\nINTERPRETATIVE ANALYSIS of view of taste can be met by the answer that everything in these cantos is as organically fitting as is anything in the other ninetyeight. 6. The first note struck; the world of grafters and corrupt politicians is a dark world, wherein they \" lie low.\" 7. Venice was in Dante's time, as it had been long before, and was to be long after, the great naval power of the world. 8. Pitch, the other characteristic of the relation sustained to each other and to their entangling profession by grafters who can only ply their nefarious trade at the expense of good government by playing into each other's corrupt hands; grafting is dark and sticky business. 19. A wonderful picture of the temporary excitement made by public suspicions of corruption and graft in the underworld, and the almost immediate subsiding of the public interest momentarily aroused. 29. The nearest modern equivalent of this black devil and his mates would seem to be something approaching a blend of the more or less permanently effective newspapers and police. 37. Evil-claws; Santa Zita being the patroness of the city of Lucca in Tuscany, the reference here is to its town council. 40. Bonturo Dati, ironically made an exception to the wholesale charge against Lucca, had the reputation of being in 1300 its boss, and the worst grafter of them all. 42. Ita, the Latin for \" yes \" used on the judicial occasions where these magistrates and lawyers testified or voted, for financial considerations, contrary to their swom duty. 46. \" Doubled up \" in a position such as that assumed by those worshipping the Holy Face, an ancient image of Christ believed to have been by the hand of Nicodemus, which was preserved in Lucca. 49. A stream near Lucca, a popular bathing resort for its inhabitants. 53. An attitude all too frequently assumed towards such people by a conniving police or press. 62. A reference to Virgil's previous descent through Hell, or to his historical experience with the corrupt politics of Rome and Italy in his time. 76. Evil Tail. 82. Two ways of viewing the same cause. 84. The promise of Reason's ultimate success in leading Man into a resultful knowledge of the world of political evil. 95. A Tuscan town which surrendered to the Lucchese, and to the Florentines with whom Dante was serving, in 1289, when a young man of twenty-four. 106-114. Three statements by the devil, the first and last of which were true, while the middle one was false; the third, moreover, being a beguiling truth of religious import. The next crag-bridge was down, but so were all\n\n[xlix]\n\nINTERPRETATIVE\n\nANALYSIS\n\nof them in the sixth trench, so that the second statement was untrue; 1266 years from 1300 took one back to the year 34, that of Christ's death, when the earthquake accompanying it shattered the outer Gate of Hell, the high bank separating the sixth from the seventh Circles, and the bridges across the Sixth Trench, that of the Hypocrites. This would seem to be the devils' formula for telling a successful lie : sandwich it between two truths. 118. These comic devils all of them have more or less significant names, some seeming to have resulted from grotesquing those of well known Italian families, which may have been tainted with this sin of graft. 125. Since there was no crag that \" all unbroken \" crossed the dens, or trenches, this ominous order was the same as telling the devils to do with the two investigating poets as they pleased. 137. The last three lines of this canto find their due explanation in the note to line 1, and at any rate are boldly endorsed by the four opening terzine of the next canto. Dante's contempt for corruption in politics was too great, and too well justified, for him to shrink from giving it the most apposite expression that occurred to him.

The brilliant mock heroic twelve-line paragraph with which this canto opens, serves to prove how allegorically significant was the close of the last, and is as organic a factor in the all-spanning Inferno as are others more agreeable to read. 5. A reference to the Battle of Campaldino in 1289, won by Florence and Lucca over Arezzo, a battle in which Dante served, as he did at Caprona. 15. Proverbial wisdom, similar to that of \" In Rome do as the Romans do,\" which harmonizes with the fact that the two poets were forced to reach the realm of Fraud by riding carefully on the back of Geryon, its symbol. 25. Frogs again as instruments of Dante's grim humor! 48. A Navarrese grafter, whose name may have been Ciampolo, though little is known of him but what is recorded here. 52. Thibaut II, Count of Champagne, King of Navarre, son-in-law of Louis IX, and a famous French lyric poet. 65. Italians have always thought of themselves as Latins. 82.\n\n[1]\n\nINTERPRETATIVE\n\nANALYSIS\n\nGallura, one of the four provinces into which the Pisans divided Sardinia; this Gomita is said to have been hanged b y Judge Nino Visconti of Gallura, who will appear in the Purgatorio. 88. Michel Zanche of Logodoro, another province of Sardinia, was vicar of Enzo, Frederick II's son, and was murdered by Branca d'Oria, whose soul Dante will see in the ice below, without waiting for him to die. 118. Dante, the sublimely happy poet the Paradiso will show him to have become, far from being exclusively \" saturnine \" as some who have only superficially read the Inferno have called him, evidently had a fair share of the lubricating sense of humor, and expected it of his readers. 127. This beats the Virgilian \" Fear added wings to his feet,\" which may have suggested it. 135. Another incident, which recalls many a modern farce, in which grafters, the police and the \" y e l l o w \" press figure with little to distinguish them from each other. 142. A last flash of dry humor, before the poet returns to the tragic aspect of the world of evil. 148. Even the agents of justice against corrupt politics get sticky with pitch at times!\n\nCANTO T H E SEVENTH CIRCLE. T H E SIXTH TRENCH.\n\nXXIII\n\nT H E H E L L OF MALICE.

The comic frivolity of the last two cantos is with fine contrast succeeded b y the solemn seriousness of this, whose tone is suggested b y the opening line. 3. Franciscans. 4. This fable, supposed to be Aesop's, told how a frog who had tied a rat to himself to tow him over the water, dived without regard to his companion, who while struggling was picked up b y a kite, who carried them both ofif. 7. Mo and issa, two Italian dialectic words meaning now. 33. An imagined evil may be even more terrible than a socalled actual one. 51. Noteworthy are the frequent expressions of the tenderness Dante felt toward the poet Virgil, whose influence upon him must have been second only to that of the Florentine maiden, Beatrice, both of whom he accepted as, severally, his rational and spiritual guides through the world of reality, 55. The fact that the executives of each trench are limited in their action to their own immediate sphere of power, is here used [ H ]\n\nINTERPRETATIVE ANALYSIS to show that in the world of Divine Justice no punishment can follow a sin of which it is not merely a picture. 58. Dante sees hypocrites as a \" painted,\" and \" burdened \" people — one of his most wonderful spiritual portraits, which besides recalling the \" whited sepulchers \" of the Gospel, is strangely reproduced in the case of Shakespeare's hypocrite, Claudius, who, lashed by Polonius' acknowledgment that \" with devotion's visage and pious action we do sugar o'er the devil himself,\" contrasts his crime with his \" most painted word,\" and exclaims: \" O heavy burthen! \" 63. Why Dante should have thought of the monks of Cologne as illustrating \" the cloak of hypocrisy \" has not been satisfactorily explained. 66. Frederick II was believed, at least by his enemies, to have had those guilty of lèse majesté clothed in lead, which was subsequently melted upon them. 67. Of course \"exhaustion\" and \"for ever\" are mutually contradictory terms; hence here as elsewhere a deeper meaning must be found for \" eternal.\" Hypocrisy is innately and inescapably \"fatiguing,\" since it involves living simultaneously two lives. 74. Dante is ever at pains to find concrete illustrations for his abstract moral and spiritual states, which is what makes a great poet greater, paradoxically speaking, than an equally great philosopher. 76. Again recognized by his Tuscan speech! 84. Hypocrites have to tread a narrow path because restlessly obliged, as the sincere and frank are not, to \" mind their p's and q's.\" 88. A third device to remind us that Dante was the only one alive in the Inferno. One symptom of hypocritical piety is the solemnity and sadness it affects. Cf. the Gospel warning: \" Be not, as the hypocrites, of a sad countenance.\" 94. As the reader will frequently note, Dante in spite of what he had suffered from it, proudly loved his native town. 99. That's it! The penalty sparkles, because the penalty is the sin. 100. Their outwardly fair-seeming piety, morality, and interest in good things are really a burden to them, and cause them (the scales) to weep and moan (creak). 103108. The second of these two hypocrites was the founder of the Jay order of the Beata Maria, whose members, not obliged to be ascetic, so availed themselves of the exemption that they came to be known as \" J o y \" Friars; these two were both at different times called to be podestà (dictators for a year) of Italian towns, and in 1266, were called together to rule Florence; while in power they razed the houses of the Uberti in the neighborhood of an old\n\n[Hi]\n\nINTERPRETATIVE ANALYSIS fortress called the Gardingo. 109. How Dante would have ended his interrupted speech we do not know, but can easily imagine, from what we know of his hatred of hypocrisy and of his love for Florence. 115. This is the archhypocrite, Caiaphas the High Priest, the second of the infamous triumvirate of the Crucifixion, Pilate the archcoward, and Judas, the archtraitor being the other two. Not \" lifted up \" as Jesus was, Dante sees Caiaphas crucified like his victim, but on the ground, and forced to bear, as their type, the burden of all subsequent hypocrites. 122. Annas, the High Priest, and the other Pharisees, whose decision to prefer the logically and temporarily \" expedient \" to the spiritually and eternally right, brought an age long trouble upon their race. 124. Virgil had been through this trench before, but Caiaphas had not come to it yet. 129. Malacoda had told him that one crag-bridge still spanned the trench. 142. The friar, having studied theology at the great university of Bologna, had heard that the devil was professionally a liar, and ironically suggests that Virgil should not have been taken in b y the pleasant outsides of the sandwich-lie. 147. And so this masterly picture of Hypocrisy, which began with the adjective \"painted,\" ends with the adjective \" burdened.\" Like all its companion pictures, its convincing power comes from the fact that a great poet addresses simultaneously his reader's total, undifferentiated intellectual aesthetic, moral and spiritual consciousness.\n\nCANTO\n\nXXIV\n\nT H E EIGHTH CIRCLE.

A s a means of emphasizing Virgil's calm self-mastery, Dante opens his next description of Fraud, b y giving his reader a charming picture of a mid-February day in Tuscany, where the snows of its short winter which permits roses to bloom in December, and spring-flowers in February, are much dreaded, largely because, on the plain, they rarely exceed the effects of a heavy frost. When the sun is in Aquarius in January and February, with spring not far off, it is beginning to warm its locks, as in early autumn it might be said to cool them, and as the season is advancing toward the vernal equinox, the nights are said to move southward, as six [liii]\n\nINTERPRETATIVE\n\nANALYSIS\n\nmonths later they would be moving toward the North. 21. When he came to Dante's rescue in the gloomy Wood. 30. Judging from his many descriptions of it throughout the poem, Dante must have had much experience in mountain-climbing during his journeys in Italy and elsewhere. 53. Dante's own experience had shown him that imponderable soul-energy was the greatest of all forces. 56. An anticipation of his long climb up Mount Purgatory. 65. The word onde of the Italian text seems to suggest that it was Dante's distinct speaking which caused the inarticulate voice in the trench he was approaching. Hence the translation. 85. His well conned Latin poets, Lucan and Ovid, had familiarized Dante with the classical snakes of the Libyan Desert, whose names have been reproduced unchanged in the translation, because their Latin names seem to make them snakier, for the same reason that the reverse would be true in the case of flowers. At any rate Dante does not propose to let either Africa or Asia boast of worse snakes than those he saw in Hell. 93. The stone, heliotrope, was supposed to render its bearer invisible. 100. Two letters each of which is written by one stroke of the pen. 106. Both Ovid and Brunetto Latini had told the oriental myth of the Phoenix, whose essentials Dante has reproduced here. 112. Epileptics, as in the Gospel account of them, were supposed to be under the control of the devil. 118. Dante is filled with admiration of the Power of God, as displayed in the miraculous transformations seen in this trench. The variant quanto è severa, \" how severe it is,\" while grammatically more satisfactory, would not give as Dantelike and significant a thought as the one here adopted. 124. Vanni Fucci of Pistoia, was a bastard, well known in Dante's time as a man of violence, but not generally suspected as a fraudulent thief; hence Dante's surprise at finding him here instead of higher up, in the relatively less guilty Seventh Circle, among highway robbers. 130. Knowing that he was recognized, Vanni Fucci does not try to hide his identity. 138. The vestry of the cathedral of Pistoia, whence some of its ecclesiastical treasures had been stolen in 1293; that Vanni Fucci was the thief was apparently discovered only some time later. 143. To vent his spite on Dante for having identified him among the snake-like thieves, Vanni Fucci proceeds to prophecy to him the misfortunes of his party, the Whites, from 1300 to 1302 or, possibly, 1306. A brief account of events will here suffice. In 1301, the Neri were driven from\n\n[liv]\n\nINTERPRETATIVE\n\nANALYSIS\n\nPistoia; later Florence changed her government b y banishing the Whites; in 1302, Moroello Malaspina (the bolt) of Lunigiana (Val di Magra) unexpectedly routed the Whites of Pistoia. W h a t ever the true historical interpretation of this meteorologically couched prophecy post eventum, it is interesting to note t h a t in 1306 Dante, in exile, was a guest of this Malaspina, and is said to h a v e dedicated his Purgatorio to him. B y the term Picene Plain D a n t e referred to the territory of Pistoia.\n\nCANTO T H E EIGHTH CIRCLE.\n\nXXV\n\nTHE HELL OF MALICE.\n\nSEVENTH TRENCH ( c o n t i n u e d ) .\n\nTHIEVES.\n\nFRAUD.

D a n t e spared none of the wrangling, faction-weakened republics of his time, which k e p t I t a l y disunited, self-enslaved, and a prey to foreign interference and aggression. Pistoia was believed to h a v e been founded b y the remnants of Catiline's rebellious army.
