        "text": "In communist Romania, a questionable reverence for those artists working together with an enduring faith in the labour ethic played a significant role in shaping self-and civic identity from the late 19 th till the near end of the second half of the twentieth century. Certainly it was a commonplace assumption that what the artists did as communists was often the most outstanding indicator of who they were. The diversity of images and objects belonging to Romanian socialist realism placed upon the worker&#39;s heels a false property of heavenly ingredients for the birth of the new communist man, and the official painters were not far from this commitment. In the present article, I shall dwell upon the way Romanian totalitarian art turned the original role of art into a manipulative tool which legitimately paved the way of the communist political system to a powerful and influential position. Keywords: Romanian socialist realism, communist art, communist new man, proletariat. As some ...\n\n\"Political power and, in particular, totalitarian regimes use sophisticated instruments of propaganda in order to legitimise their abusive or repressive measures. Ideologies were used to support, during the 20th century, totalitarian regimes, the latter’s ultimate failure leading to the “end of ideology” (Knight 622). The study is interested in the relations between the “totalitarian ideology” applied in its practices by Communism and cultural manifestation, the latter being transformed into an instrument of propaganda. The roles of art and literature within propaganda are intimately connected to the legitimising mechanism. Culture is forced to abandon any aesthetic interests, losing independence and becoming tributary to a role and a cause. It was functional, as transformed in discourse manifestations of the communist ideology with the purpose to legitimise power. It meant an artificial and dramatic shift for all Eastern Europe cultures as their natural aesthetic orientation was replaced by functionality and subordination to politics. This trauma was also experienced by the Romanian culture in the late 1940s and 1950s – case particularly analysed in the study – being forced to follow this new function of legitimising a regime that was consolidating its fragile bases.\"\n\nMy essay investigates the artistic practices made in Romania in the decades 1960-1970 which employ media and technology as principal means of production and presentation, while offering an insight into the cultural, social and political determinants underlying their production. By Media art I understand art forms produced by electronic means and which are mainly time-based: video, experimental film, sound, computer-based images, presented as single channel works or as installations. The focus of my study is equally on the means of expression (the (un)problematization of the medium, themes, narrative strategies, technologies, apparatus) and on the conditions of manifestation of these artistic productions (the cultural and political framework of the period in Romania and Eastern Europe, issues related to cultural and technological (de)synchronization, institutional and public reception, critical positioning and subversion, humor and irony as survival strategies, processes of signification and the regimes of memory associated with media art practices). Three representative artists and groups of the period will be discussed – kinema ikon, Sigma, and Ion Grigorescu. They are different in terms of approach, strategy and artistic values, but their common ground is equally represented by their significant interest in the moving image, and by their constant efforts to innovate the artistic language and the relationship with the context. Key words: Media arts, Eastern Europe, Neo-Avant-garde, Cultural synchronization, Political context\n\nThe fall of Communism gave way to a frantic search for the “truth” wherein competing narratives aimed at expunging collective memory and reconstruct national identity. In post-socialist Romania memory, history and justice have become embedded in an ongoing struggle for political power between the surviving forces of the old regime and those who believe in a complete break with the pre-1989 nationalist-communist dictatorship of Nicolae Ceausescu. Twenty five years after the Revolution, Romania’s cultural milieu has not yet escaped the boundaries of the aforementioned paradigm. This paper will not dwell on the critical anthologies cited above. Instead, it will focus on the debates surrounding the critical role of the writer-intellectual and the production of literarure inside an authoritarian regime. The main questions this paper seeks to answer is how should we approach literature produced during the Communist period? Were literary productions entirely the product of ideology? How did the literary canon evolve and how was it influenced by the historical and political context of the time? In an effort to break away from the socialist regime should all literary creations produced during he Communist era be discarded? In retrospect how should one asses the role of the writer/intellectual?\n\nhttp://www.routledge.com/books/details/9781138025158/ Nicolae Ceauşescu’s humorless and ultra-nationalist dictatorship took its comics seriously, and even held official party meetings in order to establish what children’s magazines—the main space for comics at the time—should publish. Historical comics had to teach a version of the Romanian past that would boost nationalist sentiment and justify a negative perception of the outside, while painting Romania as a country of pure-hearted valiant and hard-working men (and rarely women), permanently assailed by evil forces. This chapter examines the image of ”the foreigner” in several historical comic strips published in long-standing communist children’s magazines, where foreign nationals were extremely frequent, and generally evil. However, the representational code used by the artists in these didactic cartoons was quite realistic. The most frequently represented episodes from the (proto)Romanian past were the Roman conquest of Dacia (second century AD), the first unification of the Romanian provinces under the same political leadership (1600), a Russian-Romanian battle against the Ottoman Empire (1877), and World War II. The representations of foreigners in communist cartoons showed three main groups: the Romans (morally inferior conquerors of the proud Dacians, the Romanian ancestors), the Germans (always depicted as sly smirking uniformed Nazis, even decades after the end of World War II), and the Turks (Ottomans whose sole purpose was to conquer, pillage, and plunder). The comics contained a mixture of fictitious characters and actual participants in history, all of them treated as if they were equally “real.” During Ceauşescu’s dictatorship, the national superhero was a virtuous man (never a woman, despite the self-proclaimed feminist party line) endowed not only with heightened moral sense and loyalty to a nation whose identity had not yet been articulated, but also with uncommon physical prowess and an uncanny awareness that his bravery would help build something grand in the future, more specifically, Ceauşescu’s Romania.\n\nThe general knowledge about the political dimension of the Romanian historical avant-garde places the groups on the left of the political spectrum. However, there is little work on what this means precisely when it comes to the concrete historical situations. It may well be that \"Contimporanul\", the main press organ of the avant-garde “supported a political agenda of socialist origin”, but what does it mean specifically? In order to give a complete historical-intellectual picture of the Romanian avant-garde, specifically of Contimporanul, one must also account for the first couple of years of its appearance, when it published a large number of political opinion articles, written mainly by the same authors that would become central for the artistic movement as well. We aim to fill this gap in the scholarship by giving a detailed account of the reactions from \"Contimporanul\"’s pages to the political events of the time, notably those that involved the socialist movement. The case in point is the Trial from Dealul Spirii and the alleged political assassinations against socialist leaders committed or condoned by the state authorities. The overall image of the political ‘ideology’ of \"Contimporanul\" from those years shows rather a marked democratic attitude towards the events, and a great deal of journalistic objectivity behind the attacks against the liberal establishment."
