        "text": "This paper presents a supervised learning method for irony detection in Arabic tweets. A binary classifier uses four groups of features whose efficiency has been empirically proved in other languages such as French, English, Italian, Dutch and Japanese. Our first results are encouraging and show that state of the art features can be successfully applied to Arabic language with an accuracy of 72.76%.\n\nPrecise semantic representation of a sentence and definitive information extraction are key steps in the accurate processing of sentence meaning, especially for figurative phenomena such as sarcasm, Irony, and metaphor cause literal meanings to be discounted and secondary or extended meanings to be intentionally profiled. Semantic modelling faces a new challenge in social media, because grammatical inaccuracy is commonplace yet many previous state-of-the-art methods exploit grammatical structure. For sarcasm detection over social media content, researchers so far have counted on Bag-of-Words(BOW), N-grams etc. In this paper, we propose a neural network semantic model for the task of sarcasm detection. We also review semantic modelling using Support Vector Machine (SVM) that employs constituency parse-trees fed and labeled with syntactic and semantic information. The proposed neural network model composed of Convolution Neu-ral Network(CNN) and followed by a Long short term memory (LSTM) network and finally a Deep neural network(DNN). The proposed model outperforms state-of-the-art text-based methods for sarcasm detection, yielding an F-score of .92.\n\nEnglish. Automatic irony detection is a young field of research related to Sentiment Analysis. When dealing with social media data, the shortness of text and the extraction of the statement from his context usually makes it hard to understand irony even for humans but especially for machines. In this paper we propose an analysis of the role that textual information plays in the perception and construction of irony in short texts like tweets. We will focus on the impact of conventional expedients of digital writing, which seem to represent a substitution of typical gestures and tones of oral communication , in figurative interpretation of messages in Italian language. Elaborated computational model has been exploited in the development of an irony detection system , which has been evaluated in the Sen-tipolc's shared task at EVALITA 2016.\n\nAbstract Hashtags are used in Twitter to classify messages, propagate ideas and also to promote specific topics and people. In this paper, we present a linguistic-inspired study of how these tags are created, used and disseminated by the members of information networks. We study the propagation of hashtags in Twitter grounded on models for the analysis of the spread of linguistic innovations in speech communities, that is, in groups of people whose members linguistically influence each other.\n\nIn the domain of Natural Language Processing (NLP), the interest in figurative language is enhanced, especially in the last few years, thanks to the amount of linguistic data provided by web and social networks. Figurative language provides a non-literary sense to the words, thus the utterances require several interpretations disclosing the play of signification. In order to individuate different meaning levels in case of ironic texts detection , it is necessary a computational model appropriated to the complexity of rhetorical artifice. In this paper we describe our rule-based system of irony detection as it has been presented to the SENTIPOLC task of EVALITA 2016, where we ranked third on twelve participants.\n\nOpinion mining on Twitter recently attracted research interest in politics using Information Retrieval (IR) and Natural Language Processing (NLP). However, getting domain-specific annotated data still remains a costly manual step. In addition, the amount and quality of these annotation may be critical regarding the performance of machine learning (ML) based systems. An alternative solution is to use cross-language and cross-domain sets to simulate training data. This paper describe a ML approach to automatically annotate Spanish tweets dealing with the online-reputation of politicians. Our main finding is that a simple statistical NLP classifier without in-domain training can provide as reliable annotation as humans annotators and outperform more specific resources such as lexicon or in-domain data.\n\nEVALITA, the evaluation campaign of Natural Language Processing and Speech Tools for the Italian language, was organised for the fifth time in 2016. Six tasks, covering both re-reruns as well as completely new tasks, and an IBM-sponsored challenge, attracted a total of 34 submissions. An innovative aspect at this edition was the focus on social media data, especially Twitter, and the use of shared data across tasks, yielding a test set with layers of annotation concerning PoS tags, sentiment information, named entities and linking, and factuality information. Differently from the previous edition(s), many systems relied on a neural architecture, and achieved best results when used. From the experience and success of this edition, also in terms of dissemination of information and data, and in terms of collaboration between organisers of different tasks, we collected some reflections and suggestions that prospective EVALITA chairs might be willing to take into account for future editions."
