        "text": "\"Political power and, in particular, totalitarian regimes use sophisticated instruments of propaganda in order to legitimise their abusive or repressive measures. Ideologies were used to support, during the 20th century, totalitarian regimes, the latter’s ultimate failure leading to the “end of ideology” (Knight 622). The study is interested in the relations between the “totalitarian ideology” applied in its practices by Communism and cultural manifestation, the latter being transformed into an instrument of propaganda. The roles of art and literature within propaganda are intimately connected to the legitimising mechanism. Culture is forced to abandon any aesthetic interests, losing independence and becoming tributary to a role and a cause. It was functional, as transformed in discourse manifestations of the communist ideology with the purpose to legitimise power. It meant an artificial and dramatic shift for all Eastern Europe cultures as their natural aesthetic orientation was replaced by functionality and subordination to politics. This trauma was also experienced by the Romanian culture in the late 1940s and 1950s – case particularly analysed in the study – being forced to follow this new function of legitimising a regime that was consolidating its fragile bases.\"\n\nThe working class has often been seen as a poverty-stricken, less knowledgeable category, without a political or civic conscience, but an also indispensable one. Without the many laborers, neither the industries nor the interwar bourgeoisie workshops would have functioned, as would those of the \"communist bourgeoisie\". The present study aims to highlight the way in which the rhetoric looking at the working class was mirrored in the left-wing press. Starting with the social democratic press before the First World War, we will investigate some reference publications. Thus, we will examine not only the interwar period publications, but also the periodicals from communist Romania, both during the period of Gheorghe-Gheorghiu Dej and Nicolae Ceausescu.\n\nOur article represents a short analysis of the literature from ideological point of view during Communist regime in Romania. Taking into consideration the complexity of this topic, we focused particularly on the first stage of the communism. After 1944-1945, the process of sovietisation and satellisation has just begun in Central and Eastern Europe. The Romanian Communist Party and its internal allies managed to seize power. After that, the Romanian society underwent radical transformations. It is also the case of the culture and literature. They both suffered total changes, being influenced by the Soviet pattern. We can perceive a total metamorphose of Romanian literature. The literature, like the historiographical discourse, turned into a docile and very useful tool for propaganda and Communist ideology. So, in this period the literature became profoundly ideologized. As a consequence, we notice the poor quality of literary texts. We resorted to a theoretical approach, explaining the main concepts. We identified and analysed the main differences between socialist realism and proletcultism. We underscored the principles and characteristics of the socialist realism insisting on its anti-cosmopolitanism. Actually, in Romanian People’s Republic, we had a different type of anti-cosmopolitanism, not similar to that from U.S.S.R.\n\nThe fall of Communism gave way to a frantic search for the “truth” wherein competing narratives aimed at expunging collective memory and reconstruct national identity. In post-socialist Romania memory, history and justice have become embedded in an ongoing struggle for political power between the surviving forces of the old regime and those who believe in a complete break with the pre-1989 nationalist-communist dictatorship of Nicolae Ceausescu. Twenty five years after the Revolution, Romania’s cultural milieu has not yet escaped the boundaries of the aforementioned paradigm. This paper will not dwell on the critical anthologies cited above. Instead, it will focus on the debates surrounding the critical role of the writer-intellectual and the production of literarure inside an authoritarian regime. The main questions this paper seeks to answer is how should we approach literature produced during the Communist period? Were literary productions entirely the product of ideology? How did the literary canon evolve and how was it influenced by the historical and political context of the time? In an effort to break away from the socialist regime should all literary creations produced during he Communist era be discarded? In retrospect how should one asses the role of the writer/intellectual?\n\nTheoretical frameworkAt the beginning of WWI, we can identify two categories of journalists: &quot;the foot soldiers&quot; and &quot;the ivory tower&quot; ones. The first ones are those in the field gathering information who then pass it on to the ones in the &quot;ivory tower&quot; who work on it and synthesize it (Hentea, 2000,9). Even though the military profession has nothing to do with journalism, at a closer look we can identify a number of common traits: devotion, initiative, ability to make critical decisions in a crisis (Clem, 1992,63). For a journalist to do his job, he needs free access to the battlefield, freedom of movement within that area, and access to official military information. In case one of these conditions are not met, the accuracy of the data becomes doubtful. Unfortunately, more often than not, the military curtailed access to information or war zones by claiming &quot;military secret&quot;. (Hentea, 2000,18). A war correspondent is usually up against a few..."
