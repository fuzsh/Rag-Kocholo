Bonk Elaine Khoo\n\nP:03\n\nWhat Twenty-Eight of the Worldâs Foremost E-Learning Leaders and Thinkers Say aboutÂ Adding Some TEC-VARIETY âAs online learning continues to evolve, we hear a great deal about the access it allows and the flexibility it provides.Â But as Bonk and Khoo so clearly demonstrate, it also af- fords endless opportunities to engage and inspire learners of all ages and abilities.Â Using a well-researched theoretical framework, they have captured more than 100 easy-to-replicate virtual learning activities, guaranteed to enrich any technology-enhanced learning envi- ronment.Â This powerful and practical resource is a must-read for educators in any setting, looking to expand their repertoire of evidence-based, student-focused teaching tools and strategies.â âSusan C. Aldridge, PhD, President Drexel University Online âThe arrival of the digital era offers vast opportunities and challenges to higher education institutions in facing a new culture of teaching and learning. This book by Drs. Curtis Bonk and Elaine Khoo bring new insights on how we can maneuver through the complexities of online teaching and learning. TEC-VARIETY tackles motivation and retention grounded in psychology research. This is one of the few books that has scholarly rigor and is inter- esting and engaging reading. It is a must for academics, scholars, and course developers.â âGrace Javier Alfonso, PhD,Â Chancellor University of the Philippines, Open University âWhat a grand book! This is going to be a highly valuable resource for countless instructors and designers in online learning. Adding TEC-VARIETY is unique in that it combines the theoretical and pedagogical foundations of effective learning with 100 easy-to-implement activities that promote the engagement of online students in deep learning.Â These strategies can instantly breathe life into courses that fail to tap the enthusiasm and imagination of students.Â TEC-VARIETY has become a handbook for my design of engagement in online classes.â âRay Schroeder, Associate Vice Chancellor for Online Learning and Founding Director of theÂ Center for Online Learning, Research and ServiceÂ (COLRS) University of Illinois Springfield âThis is the best way forward for those of us teaching online, Bonk and Khoo have provided a wealth of activities to ensure that the interactions online really do enhance the expe- rience.Â Increasingly as the world splits into big and small dataâMOOCs and apps, this book can help us ensure that better learning and teaching can follow. The work shows the journey that we have taken over several years to improve the experience and learning out- comes for the distance and online learner. It suggests great strategies (100 actually!) based in solid theoretical foundations with loads of practical suggestions. I particularly enjoyed Chapter 14 with strategies about how you might work with colleagues to encourage them to try some of the ideas.â âProfessor John Hedberg, PhD,Â Millennium Innovations Professor of ICT and Education, School of Education, Macquarie University, Australia\n\nP:04\n\nâWhilst some educators are still pondering whether to move towards the ânewâ world of on- line, Bonk and Khoo have captured 2 decades of e-experience into one highly usable guide. They offer us immense joy for the online worldâa principles-based approach to motivation and engagement offering variety but also ways forÂ us to make thoughtful choices in the service of full engagement for learners.Â You can search for whatever your latest pedagogical challenge demandsâfeedback, surprise, tension, involvement . . . name your own adjective . . . and find a solution! Donât go online without it!â âProfessorÂ Gilly Salmon, Pro Vice Chancellor Learning Transformations Swinburne University of Technology, Melbourne, and author ofÂ E-moderatingÂ andÂ E-tivitiesÂ âNo more excuses for boring online courses! The TEC-VARIETY framework is the ulti- mate approach to combining theory and practice in online and blended learning.Â Not only do Bonk and Khoo present a solid theoretical framework on which online and blended learning rests, they couple that with fun, practical exercises far beyond âread and discussâ courses. The result? A highly dynamic place of motivation and engagement. This is a must read for anyone who works online.â âRena M. Palloff, PhD, Faculty, Fielding Graduate University and Owner/Lead Consultant, Crossroads West, and author of numerous books about online and virtual learning, most recently, the 2nd edition ofÂ Lessons from the Virtual Classroom âCurt Bonk and Elaine Khoo provide a welcome, much-needed resource for online teaching and learning, offering an amazing array of ideas and activities to transform online content delivery into a motivating and exciting way to learn. This toolbox of great yet very practical and tested ideas will spark the imagination of online teachers in ways to engage learners with the curriculum. It will also deepen our understanding of the potential of online educa- tion. Learning and curiosity about our world is our most basic human characteristic, and with this book Bonk and Khoo introduce educators to activities that can encourage and motivate innovative thinking and doing in online learning environments. Imagine having access to a 100+ activities that we can use or customize for our online classes: thatâs an apple for the teacher with a cherry on top!â âLinda Harasim, PhD, Professor, School of Communication, Simon Fraser University, and author of five books about collaborative technologies and online learning, most recently,Â Learning Theory and Online Technologies âBack in 1987, Chickering and Gamson articulated seven principles of good teaching. Then came the web, online learning, MOOCs, and myriad directions in support of student success. With clarity and verve, Bonk and Khoo combine memorable acronym with moti- vational principles that move us into meaningful action. Reflect on the stories, examples, and ideas herein; raise awareness and engagement; and become motivated to recraft and perfect the art of online instruction. Awesome book!â âAnn Hill Duin, PhD, Professor of Writing Studies,Â University of Minnesota, and author of several books in higher education and information technology, most recently, Cultivating Change in the Academy âProfessors Bonk and Khoo answer the dreams of all faculty development departments. Their Adding Some TEC-VARIETY is the perfect primer for incoming faculty and a page-turning reminder to the old-timers that this ânew-fangledâ online methodology is not only here to stay but it works.â âRobert F. Bromber, PhD, Head, Education Technology Branch, Marine Corps University\n\nP:05\n\nâHow to engage and motivate online learners has long been the enduring problem that frustrates online instructors and scares away many would-be online instructors. Bonk and Khoo form a dynamic duo leveraging over three decades of research to deliver a rare book that offers substantial theoretical insights into the problem while also giving clear practical guidance on how to apply those insights. This is a book that deserves a special place on your digital bookshelf, worth turning to again and again for examples and inspiration as you plan your next online adventure in learning.â âMichael Wesch, Associate Professor of Anthropology Kansas State University âe-Learning has been around more than two decades and now it is part of mainstream instruction.Â It is time to be concerned with the emotional aspects of online learners for their deep and impactful learning. With this book, Curt Bonk and Elaine Khoo, who have each been investigating e-learning for a long time, do exactly that. They have taken many years to thoroughly review the research literature and lead us on a wonderful journey through countless innovative instructional practices that they have seen or experimented with. Get this bookâit contains extensive methods ofÂ how instructors can promote quality learning with some TEC-VARIETY.â âOkhwa Lee, Professor, Dept. of Education, Director, Educational Research Institute Chungbuk National University, South Korea âBonk and Khoo wrote an excellent book, providing many interesting learning activities for online tutors, teachers, developers, etc. It is not necessary anymore to be extremely creative to find the right online pedagogic activity for your students. You just need this book and your classes will instantly become more fun. Iâm definitely going to use it with my students!â âTheo J. Bastiaens, PhD, Professor of Educational Technology FernuniversitÃ¤t in Hagen, Germany and Open Universiteit, Netherlands âBonk and Khoo suggest that we all need to ârenew our passportâ to prepare for innova- tive and exciting online learning adventures. Their new book, TEC-VARIETY, provides a roadmap for online and blended learning excursions. Using 10 themes and then charting 10 pathways to learning for each, the authors offer a unique framework thatÂ online in- structors will find invaluable. One of the most useful part of the book is the final section detailing the Web tools mentioned in each chapter. Thirty years ago when we started us- ing computers, they did little without additional hundreds of dollars invested in software. Today our digital devices can literally transport us around the world with minimal cost.â âMargaret Riel, Director,Â Center for Collaborative Action Research Pepperdine University âOne of the most common complaints I hear from organizations that offer online edu- cation is that manyâsometimes mostâlearners do not finish online courses and those who do often are not very engaged by the experience. It would be hard to underestimate the impact Adding Some TEC-VARIETY could have for these organizations and, more importantly, their learners. Curt Bonk and Elaine Khoo have created a highly practical, highly actionable resource for anyone serious about creating truly successful online learn- ing experiences.â âJeff Cobb, Host ofÂ Mission to Learn, and author of Leading the Learning RevolutionÂ andÂ 10 Ways to Be a Better Learner\n\nP:06\n\nâTEC-VARIETY is the kind of book that every teacher would need to have as a guide for their online teaching and learning. Through years of research and experiences we know that student retention is a major problem in distance and online learning, and motivating students plays a significant role in the learning process. This book by Prof. Curt J. Bonk and Dr. Elaine Khoo is a repository of ideas on motivating your learners online and how to engage them in learning. In it, you have over 100 ideas organized systematically within the TEC-VARIETY framework. I even found the CTRL-D (indicating cost, time, risks, learn- er-centeredness indices, and duration for each activity) as given by the author as guide at the end of each activity highly useful. If you are looking for practical tips to improve student retention, here is the âLibrary of Congressâ for you to choose from!â âSanjaya Mishra, Director, Commonwealth Educational Media Centre for Asia New Delhi, India and editor ofÂ Interactive Multimedia in Education and TrainingÂ andÂ Cases on Global E-learning Practices âWith the rising demand for online courses more and more instructors are being asked to teach online, often with little or no preparation. To them, as well as to more experienced instructors, Bonk and Khooâs book is a godsend. The authors set out the TEC-VARIETY framework to guide instructors on how to enhance online courses in 10 areas including student boosting student curiosity, engagement, and motivation. For each of these 10 areas they provide 10 online activities to support them. What sets this book apart from other similar ones is that Bonk and Khoo provide a solid research base to justify the activities. Iâm recommending the book to all of my faculty who teach or intend to teach online!â âRon Owston, PhD, Dean, Faculty of Education, University Professor, and Founding Director of the Institute for Research on Learning Technologies (IRLT) York University, Toronto, Ontario, Canada âBonk and Khoo articulate that we are in the âLearning Centuryâ and explain that learning now resides within everyoneâs reach. They highlight how important it is for instructors and designers to understand theory to better meet the needs of adult learners. In practice, this means that educators must also take into account the wider sociocultural, developmental, and ecological factors influencing learner actions. Using a theory to practice approach, this book offers great tools for educators and designers who want to motivate and actively engage learners in the online environment in this new learning age.â âSimone C.O. ConceiÃ§Ã£o, PhD, Professor, Department of Administrative Leadership, School of Education, University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee School of Education, and author of five books on online teaching and learning, most recently, Motivating and Retaining Online Students: Research-Based Strategies That Work âIn my job as an officer, I meet young cadets who are eager to learn for their future occu- pation. My job is to keep them motivated to do just that and this is why I enthusiastically embrace the contents of this book. It is easy to understand, use, and access. Adding Some TEC-VARIETY and the 100+ activities described are a perfect tool for those who want to make a difference in their online teaching. So, what are you waiting for? Go and discover the benefits of TEC-VARIETY. And thatÂ´s an order!â âMajor Thomas Lyck is the Head Teacher of War Studies at The Swedish Armed Forces School of Logistics,Â Skoevde, Sweden\n\nP:07\n\nâWOW! After getting an advance copy of TEC-VARIETY, I immediately emailed Curt Bonk to see if I could share it with my online course design team. The book is already a âgo- toâ resource for fresh course development ideas.â âRovy Branon, PhD, Associate Dean and Chief Technology Officer University of Wisconsin-Extensionâs Continuing Education, Outreach and E-Learning Division âAre you usually suspicious of books full of activities, tips and tricks? Do you find their lack of context and depth annoying? Me too, which is why I was so happily absorbed (but not surprised) by Curt Bonk and Elaine Khooâs most recent offering. Yes, this is a book chocka- block with ideas and practical tips for engaging learners in online learning, and for keeping them engaged. But it is more. This collection of useful approaches is grounded in learn- ing theory and research, weathered by experience, and brought sharply into focus with clear examples, each with estimates of risk, time, cost, learner-centricity, and duration. The TEC-VARIETY categories ring true, and every reader, especially those with experience in online learning, will locate gaps in their own practice. For example, Bonk and Khoo treated me to a useful collection of fresh ideas for building curiosity and for creating helpful tension or dissipating counterproductive tensionâthings Iâve largely neglected in my own courses. I plan to keep extra copies of this book available for colleagues who think online learning is confined to correspondence school methodologies, and Iâll either give them a copy or smack them over the head with one, depending on their redemption quotient.â âRichard Schwier, Professor and Head, Educational Technology and Design, Department of Curriculum Studies, University of Saskatchewan, and author of several educational technology books, most recently,Â Connections: Virtual Learning Communities âEvery teacher would benefit from this book and should keep it next to their computer and close by wherever they go. Adding Some TEC-VARIETY provides easy to understand principles and teacher-friendly activities that students will love. If you believe in holistic education and would like to see your students engaged and happy, this book is for you.â âDr. Nellie Deutsch, eLearning Professional Development Specialist, online teacher at WizIQ, faculty member of Atlantic University, Masters of Arts in Transpersonal and Leadership Studies, Toronto, Canada âCurt Bonk and Elaine Khoo are most impressive with this latest handbook on motivating participants in online learning. Adding Some TEC-VARIETY is engagingly readable, in- for-matively research based, and highly practical with its 100 suggestions for what to do not only on Monday, but conceivably for an entire online course. Perhaps most significantly, this book is free and open and available for online instructors and practitioners to share. It is clear, the world is truly open!â âVance Stevens, Webheads in ActionÂ andÂ HCT/CERT, Al Ain, UAE âThis book provides a wealth of ideas and strategies for establishing the three Rs (relevance, rigor, and relationships) for online learning.â âNorm Vaughan, Professor, Department of Education & Schooling, Mount Royal University, Calgary, Alberta and author of Blended Learning in Higher Education and Teaching in Blended Learning Environments\n\nP:08\n\nâThere is no reason for online students to not be engaged in your class. In TEC-VARIETY, Curt Bonk and Elaine Khoo demonstrate 100+ practical ways to motivate your students. A strongly motivated student can overcome a plethora of learning obstacles. Spend some time with this book and you can help your students love the subject matter as much as you do and clear up all their muddiest points. If you canât engage your students with just a handful of the 100+ practical ideas in this book, you might consider retirement.â âAl Lind, Vice President for Innovation and eLearning, Council on Postsecondary Education, Kentucky Virtual Campus âFinally there is a publication that every online educator needs to read! In Adding Some TEC-VARIETY, Bonk and Khoo have hit a home run by putting theory into action with principles we all need to teach with. From the introductory chapters focused on motivation and retention, to the fantastic principles with practical approaches anyone can put into action, online instructors and trainers need to have this book in their tool box.â âAaron H. Doering, PhD, Associate Professor, Learning Technologies, Co-Director, LT Media Lab, Bonnie Westby-Huebner Endowed Chair of Education and Technology, Institute on the Environment Fellow, College of Education + Human Development, University of Minnesota, and book author, most recently, of The New Landscape of Mobile Learning Bonk and Khoo deliver by laying out a solid, well-researched foundation for online learn- ing that includes their signature TEC-VARIETY framework and by detailing over 100 practical and effective activities. This book can help refresh and motivate seasoned online instructors as well as inspire novice instructors to provide engaging online instruction for their students. Every instructor in my online program is going to get a copy of this! âJoan Kang Shin, PhD, Professor of Practice and Director of TESOL Professional Training, Department of Education, University of Maryland, Baltimore County, and author of Our World for National Geographic Learning and Cengage âCurt and Elaine know online learning and pinpoint exactly what will foster student success in computer-mediated instruction. Adding Some TEC-VARIETY is a must-read for anyone teaching a Web-enhanced, blended, or online course, and a required resource for all online learning administrators. As an online instructor myself, I cannot wait to try the volume of relevant, action-oriented activities in my own courses to enhance student achievement.â âJarl Jonas, Program Director, Business Development, Blackboard, and Adjunct Instructor, Excelsior College âEngaging and motivating online learners is a challenge for everyone. Here is a book that you can use for yourself for the students you are teaching about online teaching, and learners learning online. There is even a chapter for administrators and organisational leaders; please set them their âhomeworkâ! All of this is freely available as chapters and also beautifully printed as a book, if you want to buy it. Thank you Curtis and Elaine.â â Niki Davis, PhD, Professor of E-learning and Director of the College of Education e-Learning Lab, University of Canterbury, New Zealand; Editor-in-Chief, Journal of Open, Flexible, and Distance Learning\n\nP:09\n\nAdding Some TEC-VARIETY 100+ Activities for Motivating and Retaining Learners Online Curtis J.

We thank each person who has attended our workshops or presentations on TEC-VARIETY during the past decade and later used the framework and gave us feedback on it. With your timely and insightful ideas, we have continued to refine and improve it. Millions of thanks to each of you! There are many kindred spirits leading our path to completion of this book. In partic- ular, we thank Vanessa Dennen from Florida State University who originally outlined aspects of this book project. Her 2006 book chapter with Bonk on online motivational strategies proved extremely helpful to us in detailing many of the activities of this book. Thanks so much, Vanessa. Visions you had for this book more than a decade ago are finally coming to fruition. If this book makes an impact anywhere in the world, it will do so as a result of your creative approach to instruction, high octane energy, and ex- tremely agile mind. Vanessa as well as our colleagues, Drs. Debra East, Xiaojing Liu, and YaTing Teng, gave us extensive feedback on the initial draft of this book. Their timely comments and insightful suggestions definitely enhanced the final product and sped up the production process. As she had done with previous book projects with Bonk, Donna Jane Askay provided invaluable editing support. Donna is not the typical editor. She immerses herself in her book projects and learns the material so well that she can challenge the authors to raise their game. She definitely did that with us. When our editor tells us she is inspired after reading our chapters, we know we are on to something. It also gives us timely momen- tum in the homestretch. Suffice it to say, we were delighted that Donna found time to participate in this project. We were also appreciative of the timely indexing services of Audrey Dorsch and the book design skills of Robyn Taylor Barbon. William Tyler Bryan-Askay did a marvelous job proofreading this big book in a time- ly fashion. Seth White was his usual highly reliable, efficient, and conscientious self on many project pieces from inception of this book project till the very end. And we would be remiss not to mention the highly creative and responsive talents of Alex Bonk on the cover design and introductory chapter graphics. Thanks for the book publishing insights and suggestions, Alex! You are the best son anyone could ask for. We also thank Ke Zhang from Wayne State University. Her previous collaboration with Bonk on the R2D2 model resulted in a book, Empowering Online Learning: 100+ Activities for Reading, Reflecting, Displaying, and Doing with Jossey-Bass in 2008. This earlier book served as a guidepost for the construction and formatting of the entire TEC- VARIETY book. It provided the starter text that every writer dreams to have. Thanks, Ke. We deeply appreciate your sage insights into trends in the field, ever-abundant en- thusiasm, heartwarming encouragement, and unique charm. There are several others still to recognize. We appreciate Jay Cross and Jeff Cobb for their advice and examples on self-publishing. We also express thanks to Travis Craine and others at Amazon CreateSpace for their timely and informative advice and for an- swering our questions over more than two years. We deeply appreciate Rose Benedict for retrieving many of the research and theory articles referenced in this book. People like\n\nP:15\n\nxiii Tom Reynolds from National University, Tom Reeves from the University of Georgia, Okhwa Lee from Chungbuk National University in Korea, Mimi Lee from the University of Houston, and Grace Lin from the University of Hawaii, served as sounding boards for some of the ideas expressed in this book. Their frank feedback, encouragement, and friendship provided the energy and sense of optimism for many of the activities and variations we detail. In addition, many other people around the planet offered us inspiration, candid feed- back, encouragement, ideas, suggestions, advice, and a host of useful Web resources. Such individuals include our wonderful colleagues and students at Indiana University and the University of Waikato, as well as many others who are far too numerous to list individually here. Thank you all. We think of each of you daily. We hope that you can use some of the ideas expressed here to find immense success online as well as support the successes of others in the Web of Learning. In closing, Curt Bonk would like to thank Professor John Stephenson for being the first to ask him to speak on online motivation back in March 2005 at Middlesex University in London. That talk eventually evolved into plans for this book. He also thanks his family members and friends for supporting him while he was writing this book. Elaine Khoo sends deep gratitude to JC, then JH, Nat, and Dan, who are her inspirations between the sunrises and sunsets. About the Authors Using decades of combined experience in online and blended learning environments, Curt Bonk and Elaine Khoo designed a book that they felt was grounded in both prac- tice and theory. Too many technology books and resources side with one or the other but seldom both. In terms of the former, counting the activity variations and extensions, there are hundreds of interactive and engaging online learning activities outlined in this book. Suffice it to say, this book is meant to be highly practical. At the same time, each principle or component of TEC-VARIETY is based on decades of research in various fields of psychology, education, business, computer science, and cognitive science. In particular, the fields of human motivation as well as human learning and cognition have contributed an enormous pool of research findings from which Bonk and Khoo have dipped into to develop and refine their framework. Bonk and Khoo have also conducted dozens of their own studies in online and blended learning as well as emerging technologies for learning, Bonk since the mid-1980s and Khoo since the late 1990s. This work spans the gamut of educational sectors including Kâ12 schools, higher education, military and corporate training, and a diverse array of informal and nontraditional settings.

Translation: Without foresight or vision the people will be lost. âKingi Tawhiao Potatau te Wherwhero, demonstrating the urgency of unification and strong Maori leadership The Web of Learning Many ideas and events led to the development of the TEC-VARIETY framework and the 100+ activities for motivating and retaining online learners described in this book. Much of it has its roots in the mid-1980s, long before most educators had ever heard of online learning. At the time, Bonk was, in fact, a deeply bored accountant working in a high-technology company. In his spare time, he enrolled in paper-based correspondence and television courses as well as outreach and extension courses to qualify for graduate school in ed- ucational psychology at the University of Wisconsin. During these courses, he learned much content knowledge in education as well as psychology. Perhaps more important, Bonk gained an appreciation for the multiple modes of educational delivery as well as the varied ways in which learners could access courses, and then change or improve their lives. When online learning began taking off a little over a decade later, he coordi- nated several national research projects on the state of e-learning and blended learning in both higher education and corporate training in the United States. His research soon entered into Kâ12 and military training settings and then expanded globally. In each project, many benefits and challenges regarding online learning were document- ed. For instance, as with centuries of correspondence and face-to-face (F2F) courses, most online courses initially relied on text alone. There was often a cookie-cutter or one-size-fits-all mentality of the right way to do things and often a favored instructional design model that would win the day. Such is the history of the instructional design field. As was soon apparent, however, prescriptive forms of instruction belonged to the pre- 1\n\nP:18\n\n2 ADDING SOME TEC-VARIETY vious world of scant learning resources and limited selections; they were not applicable to an open learning world housing vast resources, choices, and opportunities to learn. Fast-forward to the age of the Web 2.0 in the second decade of the twenty-first century. We live in a world rich with golden nuggets of free and open learning content as well as technologies for interacting and collaborating about this content. Not too surprisingly, relying on prescriptions and preset paths can lead to boredom and protests. There might also be contempt for instructors who are unwilling to allow individuals to learn as they do in more informal settings where they might rely on Twitter feeds, text messages, on- line news and reports, mobile applications, Facebook postings, and shared online video. Todayâs learners also want instruction to be highly connected to their occupations and interests. This yearning for relevant and meaningful learning will not subside anytime soon. With the growing zest for interactive, collaborative, dynamic, and relevant instruction, there is something significant happening in learning environments today across every educational level and sector. Simply put, the creation of learning materials is no longer the sole province of the instructor, instructional designer, or some other educational expert. In this new age of learning, everyone can contribute something to the palette of course materials and resources. The Web 2.0 tilts the balance of power in the classroom toward those doing the learning. They no longer have to passively consume or browse through available contents. Now, they can add to them. As Brown and Adler (2008) con- tend, learnersâ minds are now on fire as they discover and create new information and then reveal it to others. To emphasize the learning possibilities of the Web, at times we often refer to the Web as âthe Web of Learning.â This Web of Learning brings a rich tapestry of learning pos- sibilities to each connected citizen of this planet (Bonk, 2009c). The Web of Learning metaphor reminds those teaching and learning online of the thousands or perhaps mil- lions of interconnected learning-related uses of online resources and technologies. In effect, it expands the confines of traditional classroom learning by empowering learners to draw from informal learning and active social networks. Online instructors can bring in experts to their classes for real-time discussions as well as asynchronous ones. In addition to experts, learners from remote parts of the world can collaborate or interact with global peers and mentors. Curiosity is piqued. Feedback is enhanced. There is an authentic audience to interact with that extends beyond the instructor or online course system. The motivational level of learners can be elevated several degrees. Learning now resides within everyoneâs reach. It comes along with us when we attend a musical or art exhibit. When in such a setting, mobile devices can call up pertinent information that is contextually based, thereby filling in the gaps in oneâs knowledge and accelerating personal growth within a field of study. Today, resources laid down by others along our learning trail can be quickly accessed and explored. These learning markers might come in the form of comments and ratings on news articles, suggested links in Facebook status updates, tweets in Twitter to still other resources, or trackbacks embedded in blog postings. Without a doubt, this is a new learning age. We are in the âLearning Century.â Despite the plethora of ways to learn today, most online courses remain caught up in old expectations of how a course is conducted. There are captured lectures to watch\n\nP:19\n\nPREFACE TO TEC-VARIETY 3 and articles or e-books to read prior to unit quizzes and summative examinations. Such courses remain firmly rooted in a text-centered past. A joke often heard at the dawn of online learning was that some institutions and organizations were giving certificates and degrees in electronic page turning. Suffice it to say, in the age of the Web 2.0, such an approach is definitely not a laughing matter. It is no small wonder why students spurn such dreary classes in favor of those that are more in keeping with the times. Intentions Each day, and at times, each moment of that day, educators come face-to-face with the vast technological changes of the past decade. They listen to podcasts. They Skype to communicate with distant friends and relatives. They text message their spouses and children about dinner plans or the movies. Some might have a personal blog or one that they use for class activities. Others use a wiki to organize class content or to set the agen- da for a meeting. To get ready for such a meeting, they might turn to Google Docs or Wikispaces to gather and share initial ideas. The technology list and possibilities for put- ting them into use are only limited by oneâs imagination and willingness to try them out. The TEC-VARIETY framework purposely takes into account these current technolo- gy trends and attempts to stimulate their use in pedagogically effective ways. As such, it rests at the intersection of such exciting educational affordances brought about by emerging learning technologies, intrinsic as well as extrinsic motivation-related theo- ries, and the rapidly shifting perspectives on teaching and learning philosophies and approaches. For online educators who are frustrated with never-ending waves of technology and the lack of training on how to effectively use them in their courses, we hope that the TEC-VARIETY framework can offer a ray of sunshine and a new beginning for on- line educators worldwide. As part of that hope, such educators might find activities and strategies that they can make use of to nurture engagement and success online. These strategies can breathe life into current classes and programs that are failing to engage their learners. They tap into learnersâ inner resources and desires to learn and grow toward a better future. At the same time, they can invite the global sharing of ideas and knowledge as part of a worldwide community or family of learners. Since the dawn of Web-based instruction, most educators have grown accustomed to ceaseless calls to change their educational practices and reform their schools, institu- tions, or training programs. They have probably read countless reports about the need for learning to be situated and constructed by the learner. Active learning is a repeated mantra that is heard whether one is peeking in to observe a teacher in a Kâ12 classroom, walking down a cavernous hallway of some large higher education institution, sitting in the back rows of a military or corporate training summit or institute, or attending a grantees meeting of an educational foundation or government agency. The proponents of new learning theories (e.g., social constructivism, situated cogni- tion, connectivism, and so on) are well intended. However, educators in the trenches of teaching and learning need memorable, practical, and easier ways to implement active\n\nP:20\n\n4 ADDING SOME TEC-VARIETY learning ideas. This book showcases a timely and extremely usable framework for nearly any application of technology in teaching or training. However, it is particularly suitable for fully online and blended learning courses and programs. We want online educators and trainers to apply it immediately in their instructional practices. We also want them to discuss and debate with other instructors as they work with it, and compare it to any other framework or theory on which they are presently relying. Just how can theory help inform our use of technology? More specifically, how might theories of human motivation become applied in online and blended learning envi- ronments? For one, there is a growing realization that human motivation is not simply about understanding learner drives and internal feeling states but must also take into ac- count the wider sociocultural, developmental, and ecological factors influencing learner actions. The learning context or environment is as critical an aspect for continuing per- formance as oneâs personal volition or passion to learn. Of course, personal passions and goals are vital to learning, but influential too is the learning environment or path that is laid out to help in that success. The TEC-VARIETY framework considers all of these factorsâthe individual motivational state of the learner or sets of learners you are working with as well as the technology tools and resources, the pedagogical practices or activities, and various other contextual variables. In this digital era, educators are faced with a host of difficult questions to which the general public wants answers. Some of these questions are economic in nature as the costs of traditional education skyrocket. There is much sentiment that online learning can save both time and money. Many educators and politicians note that open educa- tional resources such as the freely available course contents from MIT, Berkeley, and Harvard might save learners tens of thousands of dollars in their educational pursuits. Unfortunately, there will be scant savings if learners become bored online and drop out of a class or a program entirely. In response, we hope that the 15 chapters of this book will enlighten online educators and learners across the planet about the prospect of online learning. After reading part or all of this book, educators will come to realize that in a short decade or two, we have moved from a few highly limited alternatives for delivering education to hundreds of new instructional formats, many of which were totally unimaginable just a year or two back. Where correspondence and television courses as well as books on tape once were the only nontraditional educational options, today you will discover virtual, open, col- laborative, massive, and mobile learning formats that can reach learners anywhere and anytime. We fully realize that there may be dozens or even hundreds of other frameworks avail- able to take advantage of emerging theory and technology. Perhaps TEC-VARIETY can be one of the beacons which online educators can use to help signal some safe and exciting learning passages. The motivational principles detailed in this book can assist online educators to appropriately harness the many affordances of the Web. When that happens, their students can participate in engaging teaching-learning interactions that lead not only to some short-term learning successes but also to more positive views of themselves as learners and a genuine love for this process we call learning. During the evolution of Web-based forms of learning, you may come across new tools, resources, and materials. If there is a particular technology, Web resource, or learning\n\nP:21\n\nPREFACE TO TEC-VARIETY 5 activity that you believe would enhance this book or would open our eyes to unique learning opportunities found in the Web of Learning, please do not hesitate to share it with us. Perhaps you were able to expand on or modify one or more of the activities sug- gested in this book in ways that suited your own teaching styles, content, audiences, and contexts. Or maybe you discovered powerful new approaches for implementing one or more of our activities. We encourage those who created new adaptations of the activities to share their ideas and success stories with us as well as any setbacks and challenges. We are looking forward to such sharing as we grow and learn from them as part of a community of worldwide scholars and practitioners who use a little bit of TEC- VARIETY each day. To facilitate this flow of information, we intend to continually update the TEC-VARIETY book website (http://tec-variety.com) with new pedagogical activities and ideas, technology tools, reviews, and announcements as well as stories of best practices. You can find a free PDF of the entire book at the TEC-VARIETY website that anyone is most welcome to download, use, copy, and share with others.

Act! Action will delineate and define you. âThomas Jefferson Background There comes a moment when you just know the time is ripe to push into an area. Today that area happens to be motivation and retention in online learning. Some might argue that the need for such a book was already apparent more than a decade ago. Online learning exploded in the late 1990s, especially for those in adult sectors like higher education, corporate training, and the military (Allen & Seaman, 2004, 2007, 2010b, 2014). The Kâ12 sector, in contrast, heated up much more recently (Picciano & Seaman, 2008; Watson, Murin, Vashaw, Gemin, & Rapp, and colleagues at Evergreen Education Group, 2010; Watson, 2007). Research conducted at the turn of the century, including that by Bonk, revealed enormous online drop-out rates. In higher education settings, it was not unusual to hear about the loss of 20 to 30 percent of enrolled students (Bonk, 2002a). That percentage would often double in the world of corporate and military train- ing (Bonk, 2002b; Frankola, 2001a). These data were troubling. What was happening to cause so many individuals to give up their quest to learn online? And what could be done about it? 7\n\nP:24\n\n8 ADDING SOME TEC-VARIETY The common refrain was that there was little engagement within online courses. Students would complete assigned tasks similar to those given in a correspondence or television course and wait for feedback or comments from the instructor. For many, there were technical barriers and problems that surfaced even before they could enter the online course. Once they surmounted such challenges, they had to figure out what was expect- ed and when. The directions for all this were often sketchy and assumed a level of online technology prowess that few had. Overcoming such issues was not particularly easy. Making matters worse, all that your technology access got you was a stamp on your ticket to the online learning club. Then it came time for completing your assigned tasks and submitting them. Unlike traditional classrooms, there were often no peers to run ideas by, remind each other of upcom- ing tasks, or discuss and debate ideas with. Given that online learning was so new for everyone involved, there were limited examples of prior work and minimal job aids for completing tasks. Compounding such problems, most online content was severely lacking in quality. For those who persisted with their online learning quests, there were few learning en- ticements in those early online learning days. Online courses typically provided limited goals or products to strive toward. When there was a goal, there was a highly con- strained or unclear audience for learnersâ work. Who would be providing feedback on studentsâ final products? Too often, little such feedback came. There was much irony here given that, unlike in F2F settings, students working in online or blended courses expected feedback on everything they posted to the Web. This was somewhat of a rev- elation for those accustomed to teaching in traditional, walled classrooms. Those with experience teaching correspondence courses or with tutoring students might not have been so shell-shocked. But most were not adequately prepared for this brave new online learning world. Suffice it to say, without feedback or comparison points, online students were uncertain of their learning progress. They were in a state of learning limbo. As Stanford psychol- ogist Albert Bandura (1986, 1997) might say, there was scant opportunity to develop studentsâ self-efficacy as online learners. Part of the problem was that there were few benchmarks to which to compare their performance. And when there was a target, they were often told that they were lacking in some skill or competency and could not pass on to the next level. Such gated learning communities with limited forms of feedback were especially prevalent in military and government training settings (Bonk, Olson, Wisher, & Orvis, 2002). Given this situation, it was no small wonder that there were quite hearty student drop- out numbers and plenty of other problems in those early years. Of course, these were just a few of the barriers and challenges facing online learners. Further fuel for the online retention travesty was the general lack of instructor and student training for such envi- ronments. Add to that poorly designed courses, insufficient or inept strategic planning, and constantly changing demands and expectations, and much could and did go wrong in those early online courses. Still, the hype bandwagon kept playing the all-too-familiar songs, such as âif you build it, they will comeâ and âif you do not jump in now, it will be too late.â\n\nP:25\n\nINTRODUCING TEC-VARIETY 9 The Read, Reflect, Display, and Do (R2D2) Model In partial response to this situation, in 2005, Bonk and Professor Ke Zhang at Wayne State University designed an easy-to-apply and highly practical framework for address- ing more diverse learner needs (Bonk & Zhang, 2006). It is called the Read, Reflect, Display, and Do (R2D2) model (see Figure 1.1). The R2D2 model was published in a book titled Empowering Online Learning: 100+ Activities for Reading, Reflecting, Displaying, and Doing (Bonk & Zhang, 2008). In the book, there are 25 activities for each of the four quadrants of the model, or 100 activities in total. As explained in Empowering Online Learning, some might think of the R2D2 model as a knowledge acquisition and use cycle as well as a problem-solving wheel. FIGURE 1.1: R2D2 COMPONENTS. The first phase of the model emphasizes reading, listening, and text-based activities. That initial phase or component helps to focus instruction on acquiring knowledge through various mechanisms including online readings, podcasts, and Web-streamed lectures. Next, in the second phase, the R2D2 model highlights the observational side of learning. In this component, the online instructor targets reflection on content and self-checking or reviewing learnersâ understanding of, for example, blogging, online practice tests, and shared online video reflections. Third, the model highlights visual forms of learning including timelines, concept maps, flowcharts, and videos. Here, the learner is required to create visual representations of her learning and put it on display for the instructor or others to review and comment on. Alternatively, a learner might use or review the visual content or depictions created by others. Finally, the fourth phase of R2D2 is intended to encourage practice or hands-on experimentation with the learned content. In this phase, learners operationalize the content by solving cases, completing various problems in a simulation, or posting a report or video summary. As these activities take place, course content and activities become more enriching and personally meaningful for learners.\n\nP:26\n\n10 ADDING SOME TEC-VARIETY As with any educational model, there are many caveats and guidelines. For instance, the four phases can proceed in any order. In addition, those using R2D2 should keep in mind that many activities take place in two or more phases of the model. In the end, the instructor and others involved in the design, delivery, and implementation of the course can decide on how, when, and where R2D2 might prove beneficial for their context. They might even employ it as a means to design or prepare instruction. Rather than an instructional design model per se, R2D2 is a means to make sense of the learning and instruction possibilities of the Web. It is a simple four-part model of what is now possible online, and is also intended to help with addressing diverse learners and offering more variety, flexibility, choice, and learning empowerment. Some may, in fact, use it as a learning style model. Others could use it to fashion courses from a prob- lem-solving point of view. Whatever the perspective, R2D2 can help teachers think about their online instructional practices. It is just one model. But it is a starting point for online teaching and learning considerations. And it can be a means of reducing the tension and stress of teaching online. Given the never-ending parade of emerging technologies for learning, both experienced and novice online instructors face great difficulties deciding which tools, activities, and resources can enhance their online and blended courses. R2D2 can help. The TEC-VARIETY Framework A second guide to assist those new to online learning or seeking additional support is an acronym called the TEC-VARIETY framework. As indicated by the title, this book will present many stories, examples, and ideas regarding how this easy-to-remember mne- monic aid can enhance online instruction. In some ways, the TEC-VARIETY framework builds on the R2D2 model. For instance, it also synthesizes the varied ways for enhancing Web pedagogy into a few principles or ideas that, when combined, can powerfully boost the chances for online learning success. However, instead of four aspects of learningâ reading, reflecting, displaying, and doingâthis framework addresses different aspects of learner motivation. In fact, as noted below, each letter of TEC-VARIETY stands for one or more motivational principles. 1. Tone/Climate: Psychological Safety, Comfort, Sense of Belonging 2. Encouragement: Feedback, Responsiveness, Praise, Supports 3. Curiosity: Surprise, Intrigue, Unknowns 4. Variety: Novelty, Fun, Fantasy 5. Autonomy: Choice, Control, Flexibility, Opportunities 6. Relevance: Meaningful, Authentic, Interesting 7. Interactivity: Collaborative, Team-Based, Community 8. Engagement: Effort, Involvement, Investment 9. Tension: Challenge, Dissonance, Controversy 10. Yielding Products: Goal Driven, Purposeful Vision, Ownership\n\nP:27\n\nINTRODUCING TEC-VARIETY 11 The TEC-VARIETY framework represents our combined three decades of research, teaching, and general exploration in Web-based learning environments. Since the start of this millennium, each of us had thought deeply about ways to elevate the quality of online learning. From time to time, we shared our insights and ideas with each other. Initially, we were concerned about issues related to effective online moderating and fa- cilitating. Khoo, in fact, closely studied online moderation for a number of years as part of her dissertation research. As the two of us discussed, reflected on, and wrote about effective pedagogy, we found among online educators and those considering teaching online a general lack of understanding about how to motivate their students and raise their level of engagement. This concern extended to Web-enhanced or supplemented courses, not just fully online ones. In fact, the following quotation from an instructor whom Khoo interviewed epitomizes some of those issues. He described how his online teaching pedagogy eventually evolved from âshovelwareâ into a more refined practice: âWeâre all new at the game and we all evolve in how we go about teaching because when we did start we were very much âshovelwareâ sort of people. We almost transcribed our on-campus lectures and put them up there on the computer for people to sit and read our lectures but as time has gone by, weâve found that that isnât very effective.â The transition for this instructor, however, did not happen overnight. The evolution required a constant examination and reflection of his teaching beliefs and practices cou- pled with a degree of risk taking and experimentation to take advantage of the Webâs capabilities to enhance his studentsâ learning. Only once this had occurred could this instructor begin to recraft and perfect his art at online instructionâan important point which we will revisit several times in the remaining chapters of this book. It was also clear from our own experiences and from the prevailing literature that moti- vation has a direct bearing on student satisfaction and ultimately on learner retention in online and blended courses. Of course, we realized that motivation was a major concern not only for instructors but for administrators faced with decisions about whether to offer particular classes, degrees, or programs online. Students, too, wanted to be assured that they were not being sent to some type of learning purgatory or detention camp when enrolling in such courses. Although technology-rich learning environments ini- tially intrigued them, many had heard horror stories about online courses and programs. With that in mind, we spent a couple of years collecting, reading, and categorizing arti- cles related to student motivation. For over a decade, Bonk has presented ideas related to online motivation and retention to many audiences, from Kâ12 to higher education to corporate and military training and beyond. During this time, he has accumulated a suite of online learning examples for an assortment of motivational principles from audience members, colleagues, and his own personal explorations. Gradually, these principles became formulated in the âTEC-VARIETYâ mnemonic or framework. We hope that, like R2D2, TEC-VARIETY can be a catalyst for discussing, devel- oping, and delivering online courses or course components. Each time we share the TEC-VARIETY framework, audience feedback indicates extensive interest. They soon discover that when the ten principles are combined, the results can be extremely power- ful. People who have applied the framework have not only told us that it works, but they have sent us hundreds of engaging examples of how they are using it.\n\nP:28\n\n12 ADDING SOME TEC-VARIETY In addition to such anecdotal evidence, our own research in corporate and military training as well as Kâ12 schools and higher education environments indicates that each of the 10 principles plays a key role in online learning success. As you will discover in the ensuing chapters, our research and that of many others highlights the importance of moving from traditional instructional formats with teacher telling or lecture-based practices and requisite textbooks to an environment where there is much more learner discussion and reflection on content. Success occurs when learners feel that they know each other well. It also happens when there are choices and at least some degree of flexi- bility in learning, when students take ownership over their learning, and when galleries of learner projects and products are on display for others to discuss and debate. Such environments are more hands-on, collaborative, and active (Kim & Bonk, 2006). TEC- VARIETY can guide and facilitate such educational transformations. Each framework, R2D2 and TEC-VARIETY, can play a role in enhancing your online courses and activities. Their respective use will depend on your course content and context, the cultural backgrounds of the participants, student and instructor familiar- ity with online learning, and any known learning preferences. As indicated, we firmly believe that motivation provides the core structure for online learning success. When instructors can capture student interest in the specific learning activity, or, better yet, the overall course or program, then the road to success is more swiftly and energetically traveled. Besides a desire to learn, students need to feel curiosity and excitement about the course contents as well as some sense of tension and challenge along the way. They need to experience a sense of empowerment and control over their learning destinies, enhanced by the social presence of their instructors and fellow students. Such individu- als help lay the markers and signposts along the trail of learner success. Book Content and Organization As in the R2D2 book, a set of instructional options facing online instructors and support personnel has been detailed for each activity in this book. These options include the degree of risk, time, and cost; all are rated from low to high. We also note the degree of learner-centeredness of each task. Most online instructors we encounter in our respec- tive travels claim to be seeking activities that contain minimal risk, are user-friendly and inexpensive, and do not chew up a ton of time. Although low-risk, low-cost, and low-time activities can pique instructorsâ interests, in actuality, many are quite willing to experiment at the outer edges of the risk and time continua. Some might even have funding to pay for websites or tools that charge a fee. Our detailed information about such variables is intended to help with task selection as well as professional reflection on your teaching. We hope that it also helps to nudge many of you reading this book to try out ideas you had not considered previously and then share them with your colleagues. In the coming chapters, we will often mention an educational setting where we have seen an activity used. That does not preclude its use in another area or environment. In fact, it is crucial to point out that an online activity deemed applicable to a particular discipline, educational group, or age level can often find substantive use within another educational\n\nP:29\n\nINTRODUCING TEC-VARIETY 13 population or environment. With appropriate modifications and guidelines, nearly all of the 100 strategies outlined in this book can be applied to any population of learners. The format of this book is intended to help the reader make sense of the powerful learn- ing opportunities in this Web of Learning. As with the R2D2 book, in this particular book, you will find the following: â¢ Details on 100 easy-to-implement online instructional activities. â¢ Ideas for varying and extending each activity, amounting to a wealth of ideas for creating highly motivational online learning courses and environments. â¢ Caveats and practical guidance for each activity as well as recommendations for the TEC-VARIETY framework as a whole. Such advice should prove beneficial to online instructors, instructional designers, courseware design- ers, course management developers and vendors, training managers and administrators, and many others. â¢ Ideas, anecdotes, and examples to which online instructors and their students can personally relate. â¢ An assembly of Web-based learning tools and resources that are potentially useful in a range of learning situations, educational sectors, and fields or disciplines, in addition to ideas for how to thoughtfully integrate them. This book is divided into three parts. At the beginning of the first section, the Preface describes the background information for this book. Here in Chapter One, we introduce the TEC-VARIETY framework and explain the journey that led to it. We also delineate the purpose and scope of this book. The second chapter lays out the theory, research, and practice related to online attrition and retention. In the third chapter, key motiva- tional concepts and principles are detailed from the standpoint of four perspectives on human learningânamely, behaviorism, cognitivism, constructivism, and sociocultural theory. We also delve more deeply into the associated psychological principles of the framework. Given that research on human motivation extends back for more than a century, we will focus on that which is most pertinent to online learning environments. As such, Chapter Three will concentrate on principles such as feedback, psychological safety, control, dissonance, fantasy, engagement, goal setting, and interactivity. The first few chapters along with the Preface, therefore, will form the core or base for the online motivation-related applications documented in much of the rest of the book. The TEC-VARIETY framework has 10 main principles. Each principle will have its own featured chapter; that is, Chapters Four to Thirteen will each contain 10 activities, form- ing the second key section of this book. To help the reader, Table 1.1 is an overview of the 10 main principles of the framework and the corresponding instructional activities for each principle detailed in this book. In the third section, Chapter Fourteen offers an assortment of ideas for how to work with resistant and less experienced online instructors, those who are new to online learning and instruction, and those who are more experienced but have not yet attempt- ed a blended or fully online course. As noted in that chapter, such ideas should be bound into a systemic professional development program or initiative, not simply treated as one-off solutions. Finally, Chapter Fifteen recaps the journey within the book and the components of the TEC-VARIETY framework while suggesting how the framework\n\nP:30\n\nTABLE 1.1: 100+ ACTIVITIES FOR TEC-VARIETY. 14 ADDING SOME TEC-VARIETY\n\nP:31\n\nRELEVANCE INTERACTIVE ENGAGEMENT 81.

In this final chapter, we summarize the 100+ activities and assorted ideas from the previous chapters into one table showing the degree of time, risk, and cost for each activity. We also discuss ways to integrate var- ious principles of the framework to create more effective and engaging fully online and blended learning courses. Using the two recap tables, the reader can quickly find needed information applicable to one or more component of the TEC-VARIETY framework. When combined, Chapters Four through Thirteen contain the 100+ advertised activities of this book. If it is the start of your online class and you are in need of an icebreaker, there are 10 sample ones in Chapter Four. On the other hand, if you are reaching the end of a unit or the course, you might find the product-based ideas of Chapter Thirteen more to your liking. And if you simply desire a change of pace, then the ideas and activities of Chapter Seven on variety may have just what you seek. In whatever ways you plan to use this book, it is vital to be thoughtful in your integration and exploitation of Web technology. As indicated, there are more than 100 different activities in this one book. To help the reader review and understand as many of these as possible, a description and purpose is included for each activity. Also detailed are the skills and objectives, advice and ideas, and various instructional considerations related to the degree of time, risk, cost, and learner-centeredness of each activity. We also offer a variation for each activity. Such variations raise the pool of instructional ideas in this book from 100 to at least 200. And when the ideas from both the R2D2 book and this one are combined, juxtaposed against one another, and intermingled in ways heretofore not seen, there are seemingly count- less ideas for online instructors to consider. What should become apparent is that this book simultaneously provides an overarching lens related to motivation with technology as well as a series of specific approaches for effective instruction. You will find a macro framework in addition to dozens of more micro-level ideas that can be implemented each time you journey online. This book should provide you with a convenient and purposeful toolkit to boost your confidence as an online instructor or instructional designer. It should also offer needed informa- tion for managers and directors of learning organizations and enrichment for the casual observer who is simply interested in online learning. As TEC-VARIETY becomes part of your instructional blood, it may even have an impact on your instructional decisions in traditional F2F instructional settings. Once the framework is internalized, you might be better equipped to address diverse learner needs and personalize their learning envi- ronment in novel and exciting ways. We hope so and we look forward to hearing about your results. As a resource for more personalized and engaging learning, we hope that you will make journeys back to sections of this book as needed. When you do, you will come across several key learning resources intended to help you best use this book. First, embedded in Chapter One is a table listing the 100 activities in this book according to the main 10 motivational principles of the TEC-VARIETY framework. In addition, a similar table in the final chapter recaps these activities according to indices of time, risk, and cost as well as learner-centeredness. There is also a list of Web resources which are sorted by chapter to help with your search. These Web resources and references at the back of the book can be used to further explore most topics mentioned in the book. To expedite your explorations, both the book references and Web links can be found at the bookâs website,\n\nP:33\n\nINTRODUCING TEC-VARIETY 17 http://tec-variety.com. Of course, we welcome and appreciate any suggestions you may have for enhancing the site. Goals and Uses of this Book This book can be employed in a variety of settings and situations. Some might use it in a masterâs course in educational technology such as online learning leadership, instruc- tional design, technology and motivation, distance learning, and e-learning. Others could use it with pre-service or in-service teachers in one or more technology appli- cations or methods courses. Students in such courses will begin to grasp the range of learning opportunities on the Web as well as grapple with how they could personally employ various technology tools and Web resources. Those in corporate, government, and military settings may see this book as a means to create, review, and modify online course content and activities. They might set up insti- tutes, workshops, and summits around some of the ideas from this book and others in the field. Many individuals we have encountered in such adult-based learning situations are in the midst of a significant overhaul of their online content due to concerns about learner completion rates, sustainability, cost-effectiveness, and the impact of their train- ing programs. We believe that the TEC-VARIETY framework speaks directly to each of those concerns. As noted with the R2D2 book, this book offers one view or perspective on how to de- sign effective online and blended learning environments. There are countless others. Neither R2D2 nor TEC-VARIETY is intended as an instructional design model. Still, each provides a mechanism for reflecting on the quality of online courses and course contents as well as a guide for designing new ones. TEC-VARIETY is a tool to assist those pondering teaching online for the very first time. It can also help the more sea- soned online instructor seeking to verify her online teaching practices and perhaps push beyond them. The audience of the book, therefore, includes instructors, tutors, trainers, instructional designers, administrators, and anyone wanting to know about effective forms of Web-based instruction. Caveats Regarding the Web Resources, Tools, and Activities Listed Many aspects of this book are purposefully intended to help the reader understand and then find resources that can assist in motivating and retaining online learners. We cover a wide gamut of Web resources, technologies, and disciplines. As already mentioned, at the end of the book, we recap the Web resources mentioned along the way. We must cau- tion the reader, however, that we did not select a particular technology tool or resource to promote or advocate personally, nor do we offer any guidelines or recommendations\n\nP:34\n\n18 ADDING SOME TEC-VARIETY for deciding between them. Nevertheless, in each chapter, we include references to the prevailing literature related to many of the techniques and tools suggested. Keep in mind that there are undoubtedly dozens of other highly useful tools that you may have heard about or already use in your classes. This is not a technology book nor is it a book devoted solely to instructional methods; instead, it is a text addressing the intersection of technology, pedagogy, and learning. As such, it is filled with options and opportunities to ignite the interest of experienced and novice instructors and that of their students. Given the range of options, we recommend that you test out or experi- ment with a particular website or tool before incorporating it into a learning experience in your classes. You should also keep in mind that during the coming years, many of the tools and re- sources that are documented in this book will be replaced or discarded, or will have morphed into some larger system. Websites and associated URLs may change or disap- pear in the blink of an eye and then reemerge a week or month later in a more robust or useful format. New ownership often results in name changes or new locations for a popular technology or resource. If you cannot find something that we mention and it sounds interesting, keep searching or perhaps write to one of us. What should become obvious as you scan through this book is that the 100+ activities outlined in it are often real examples that we have personally encountered or seen in use by others. A few of them may remain future goals and visions for our own classes, but all are possible today. We must also remind the reader that although we have attempted most of the tasks and activities described in this book, there are dozens of different ways to use each one. Our examples, therefore, are not prescriptions or the only ways to use them some of these ideas. Instead, you should flexibly apply these activities according to your specific learning situation or context. We realize that some of these ideas will not work in every educational sector or course level. Ignore or put a red âXâ by activities that will not work for you. Concentrate on those that might find success in your learning environment or situation. And for any activities you are not sure about, use your creative juices and imagination to enhance, extend, and transform them. When you do that, the 100+ ideas of this book explode to tens of thousands. We provide the kernels or skeletons for many instructional ideas. As you review each one, you should reflect on how to add some meat to those bones and get those kernels popping. You should also realize that there are thousands of other ideas that did not make it into this book. Given that the field is changing so rapidly, it is impossible for a single book to point to all the opportunities educators have today. Need more ideas? Explore the R2D2 book as well as other online learning books. Be patient. If there is something that you really want to do online in your classes or programs, eventually you will be able to do it. We hope you enjoy the rest of the book.\n\nP:35\n\nCHAPTER TWO ONLINE LEARNING ATTRITION AND RETENTION Theory to Practice I didnât fail the test, I just found 100 ways to do it wrong. âBenjamin Franklin Background We remember growing up in the 1970s and 1980s when the norm was to try to get into college or university after high school so you could find a good job and eventually attain a productive and well-respected career. Competition to get the best grades was fierce. Many of our friends wanted to attend the most prestigious universities. âCorrespondence coursesâ (as distance learning was called back then) were viewed as the poor cousin to the more traditional campus-based courses. Fueling such attitudes, the correspondence courses offered were often clerical, administrative, or semivocational in nature. This situation did not deter the millions of correspondence learners brave enough to give it a go, including Bonk, who enrolled in a couple of television and correspondence courses in the mid-1980s prior to entering graduate school. Bonk formed a person- al bond with his designated course instructor, Dr. Robert Clasen of the University of Wisconsin, and as a result, he fairly quickly completed each of these courses. A few 19\n\nP:36\n\n20 ADDING SOME TEC-VARIETY months later, Professor Clasen hired him to help with a new television course on critical thinking shortly after he arrived at the University of Wisconsin for graduate school. Near the end of that decade, Khooâs good friend, Jamie, took up the challenge of learning through correspondence after she and Khoo had completed high school. Not being ac- ademically inclined, Jamie signed up for a clerical course via correspondence. Within a few weeks, she was sent her first few packages of manuals, instructions, and assignments via the postal service. She would complete her assigned tasks, mail them back, and get the next lot of assignments. This went on for about 10 months. Early enthusiasm with the course and materials eventually turned to despair. Her lament? Jamie felt that she was mostly on her own throughout this course. Unlike Bonkâs experience, there was no one to support or help her when she had questions. She received written feedback every couple of months upon submitting her work. In be- tween, she was basically in isolation. And as the material became more difficult, Jamieâs anxieties increased. Soon she quit. The process was just too hard. Jamieâs story is typical of the early distance learning scenario. Of course, there were many highly visible success stories like Bonkâs who, coincidentally, would likely not have authored this book had he not had access to such distance learning courses. Nevertheless, a majority of folks found it too frustrating to sustain the motivation to chug on alone in such courses. Fast-forward to the twenty-first century. Todayâs distance educators have a multitude of choices when it comes to selecting from available communicative technological tools to enhance their teaching or training practices and support their studentsâ learning. Unlike Jamieâs learning options, technology resources have expanded to include podcasted lec- tures, mobile flashcards, expert blog posts, wiki-based multimedia course glossaries, YouTube video lectures and expert demonstrations, course announcements and re- minders in Twitter, and other vast information networks contributed by people around the planet (e.g., Wikipedia). With these new means to foster learner interaction, collab- oration, engagement, and personal study, schools, universities, and corporate training departments worldwide have embraced the culture and fervor surrounding Web-based distance learning. There is now wide recognition and elevated status accorded to online courses and programs in a range of academic disciplines that are either offered entirely online or use different forms of blended learning to supplement current F2F programs. Consider current statistics. We increasingly hear reports on how the number of students and corporate employees attracted to the potential of open, flexible, and distance learn- ing options continues to accelerate. By 2011, the worldwide expenditures for e-learning services and products amounted to over $35.6 billion. Equally astounding, it was fore- casted to grow at a 7.6 percent five year compound annual growth rate, thereby reaching nearly $51.5 billion by 2016. Double-digit five year growth forecasts (from 2011 to 2016) for online learning are estimated for the top two fastest growing markets, namely, Asia (at 17.3 percent), and Eastern Europe (at 16.9 percent). The US market alone was expect- ed to hit $27.2 billion by 2016 (Ambient Insight, 2012). Online student numbers rose significantly since the start of the century. As of August 2012, there were more than 30 million online higher education students worldwide who took one or more of their classes online. Over half were in the United States (Ambient Insight, 2013). Forty percent of these students view online learning components as essen- tial to their learning experience (Blackboard Kâ12, 2011). In 2011, over 320,000 primary\n\nP:37\n\nONLINE LEARNING ATTRITION AND RETENTION 21 and secondary school students in the United States were found to attend a virtual school. The fastest growing sector of online learning, in fact, was the PreKâ12 market which has been growing at a rate of nearly 17 percent. In fact, it has been projected that a whopping 17 million Kâ12 students in the United States will be taking at least one online course by 2015 (Ambient Insight, 2011). A national survey from the Sloan Consortium on online learning in 2010 indicated that there were 5.6 million college students enrolled in at least one online course in the fall of 2009 (Allen & Seaman, 2010b). This figure increased to over 7 million by 2013 (Allen & Seaman, 2014). The 2014 report from Allen and Seaman revealed that more than one-third of all college and university students were taking at least one online course. Perhaps most impressive was the 12.7 percent growth rate for online enrollments from 2008 to 2013 which far exceeded the paltry 3.1 percent enrollment growth rate for high- er education overall. Such news keeps coming. Late in the summer of 2011, a massive open online course (MOOC) offered by two of the worldâs leading artificial intelligent researchers from Stanford University drew more than 100,000 students (Markoff, 2011). In early 2012, MOOC providers like Coursera, edX, and Udacity sprang forth to offer these new types of online courses. By August of that year, Coursera enrolled more than a million learn- ers from nearly 200 countries. Students in a single MOOC can come from hundreds of countries (Koller, Ng, Do, & Chen, 2013). Such figures signal that the radical growth of online learning is likely to increase dramatically in the coming decades. Commonly cited reasons for enrolling in Web-based learning include the flexibility of learning across time, distance, and space. Another factor typically mentioned is an op- portunity for empowerment and autonomy with the wide array of learning options and choices at oneâs fingertips. With online learning, students enjoy enhanced personaliza- tion and a sense of control or ability to take charge of what they need to learn. Other reasons include a personal desire to explore knowledge and ideas, the ability to network globally with peers and exchange ideas with like-minded others, and a chance to satisfy oneâs curiosity. At the Kâ12 level, the reasons range widely from needing remedial cours- es to wanting to take advanced coursework, to needing classwork while on an extended stay in the hospital, to being homeschooled, whether by choice or because of pregnancy, bullying, or other issues (Bonk, 2009a). A Chink in the Online Learning Armor In tandem with the development of new communicative technologies in the distance learning arena come concerns for effective instructional design and pedagogies to ensure that students are effectively learning the content. During the past two decades, online learning researchers and educators around the world have voiced loud concerns about innumerable problems in online pedagogy. In Australia alone, there are dozens of books and research reports from established online learning pioneers like John Hedberg, Gilly Salmon, Jan Herrington, Catherine McLoughlin, and Ron Oliver who are highly critical and cautious about the state of online pedagogy.\n\nP:38\n\n22 ADDING SOME TEC-VARIETY A major concern, not just in Australia but around the planet, is with the lackluster and disconcerting news of low online learner completion rates. We are confronted with head- lines screaming, âOnline and Incompleteâ (Jaschik, 2011), âOnline Learning Facing 80% Attrition Ratesâ (Flood, 2002), âPreventing Online Dropouts: Does Anything Work?â (Parry, 2010), and â100 Pounds of Potatoes in a 25-Pound Sack: Stress, Frustration, and Learning in the Virtual Classroomâ (Mello, 2002). Such reports reveal a chink in the online learning armor, echoing the same story of frustrated and bored distance learn- ers living Jamieâs experience all over again. Unfortunately, many educators become so enamored by every new wave of learning technology that each is adopted in superficial ways akin to âgift wrappingâ old wine in new bottles (Fischer, 2003). A report in early 2014, however, found that four in ten academic leaders in higher education settings in the United States felt that it was more difficult to retain online learning students than F2F students (Allen & Seaman, 2014; Kolowich, 2014). Such concerns are not without merit. Online learners, in fact, are reported to have higher noncompletion, withdrawal, or drop-out rates (i.e., attrition) compared to their counterparts taking F2F campus-based courses (Park, 2007; Phipps & Merisotis, 2000). A survey by Jaggars and Xu (2010) among two-year community college students found that students enrolled in purely online courses fare worse than their contemporaries enrolled in hybrid and F2F courses on campus. The noncompletion rate for these fully online students was estimated to be 10â15 percent higher than the rate among students in hybrid and F2F contexts (Xu & Jaggars, 2011). Similarly, Cellilo (n.d.) reported drop- out figures amounting to 30 percent in online classes compared to the 10â15 percent drop-out rates experienced in traditional classes. The numbers are often even worse in the corporate world. In the early years of Web- based instruction, drop-out rates in the online training world ranged dramatically from about 10â20 percent (Frankola, 2001b) to well over 50 percent and perhaps as high as 80 percent (Bonk, 2002; Flood, 2002; Ganzel, 2001). Fast-forward a decade and the retention news is even more depressing; at least for the latest distance learning phenomenaâMOOCs (Kolowich, 2014). Drop-out rates for MOOCs often exceed 90 percent. In fact, MOOC completion rates of a mere 5 percent are not uncommon (Koller et al., 2013). As an example, in a course on bioelectrici- ty at Duke University in the fall of 2012, nearly 13,000 people signed up but only 350 participants, or less than 3 percent, completed it (Rivard, 2013). Although the course introduction video was viewed 8,000 times, most of those enrolled did not watch more than one or two instructor lectures and even fewer took the course quizzes. Such num- bers are not atypical. A key question, then, is how to get those enrolled in MOOCs, or any type of online course, to stay beyond the first week or two. A decade ago, a study at the U.K. Open University (Simpson, 2004) revealed that only the more confident distance students completed assignments at any stage of their study. Such research suggests that it is criti- cal to extensively support novice online learners in the early stages of such a course. As part of that support, MOOC participants, and perhaps all online learners, need to feel connected or part of a learning community where their questions and concerns can be addressed. Hence, there are often local meet-up or study groups that get together or interact in physical or online settings to discuss their course progression. Given the pro-\n\nP:39\n\nONLINE LEARNING ATTRITION AND RETENTION 23 jected increases in the use of MOOCs in higher education as well as other educational sectors, such types of support groups will increase in the coming years. Online student retention (the number of students following through a course or pro- gram; also called âpersistersâ) is a highly distressing issue for institutions, administrators, and educators all over world. In fact, it has been cited as one of the greatest weakness- es in online education (Berge & Huang, 2004; Herbert, 2006; Jun, 2005). Chief among the factors contributing to attrition is lack of student motivation (Bonk, 2002; Cocea, 2007; Wolcott & Burnham, 1991), conflicts of time (Hiltz & Goldman, 2005), and lack of interaction or support from the instructor (Carr, 2000; Hara & Kling, 2000; Moore & Kearsley, 1996). In addition, the survey by Xu and Jaggars (2011) touched on reasons such as lack of both faculty and peer support and interaction, sense of isolation, time constraints, technical difficulties, and a general lack of structure as common reasons for dropping out of online courses. Naturally, educational institutions and corporations must justify their investments in online learning programs to their stakeholders. Decisions about the degree to which they utilize the Web for fully online and blended forms of instruction affects wider issues such as organizational planning, training, and assessment (Bonk, 2002; Tyler- Smith, 2006). Never before have considerations about effective approaches to engaging students in online courses been more urgent. Issues such as access to education, learn- ing outcomes, and the perceived value and credibility of online courses, programs, and qualifications all hang precariously on the extent to which institutions and organizations are capable of retaining their students (Cocea, 2007; Tyler-Smith, 2006). We turn now to research in online student attrition and retention to gain an understanding of some of the factors influencing a studentâs decision to leave or to complete an online course or program. Understanding Online Student Attrition In the latter part of the previous century, several popular models of student attrition and retention in formal educational programs were conceived. Vincent Tinto, whom some consider the godfather of student retention issues in higher education, has a model that has been widely cited and used (Tinto, 1975). The results from Tintoâs longitudinal study of on-campus student retention rates led him to surmise that the likelihood of a student choosing to persist with or discontinue formal study is based on the degree to which she is able to integrate into the academic system of the institution. The components of such a system include intellectual development as typically exhibited by grade performance and learner portfolios as well as the social interaction system composed of the course lecturers, guest experts, and peers. The combination of academic and social integration factors was revolutionary for that time and became the basis from which later models were designed and adapted. David Kember (1989) expanded on Tintoâs model to consider unique learner charac- teristics typical in distance education arenas. Such characteristics include the fact the students in these courses are likely to be mature adults studying part-time who are si- multaneously juggling family and work responsibilities. Elements of Kemberâs model\n\nP:40\n\n24 ADDING SOME TEC-VARIETY include Learner characteristics, Learner Goal commitment (intrinsically versus extrin- sically motivated), the Academic environment, and the Social/Work environment. Cost/ benefit analyses also play a role in retention in his model. Kember pointed out that these elements need to be integrated and often change during the studentsâ academic career. From his perspective, students then weigh together all these factors when making the decision to complete or drop out of a course or program. Building on these ideas, recent models of online student attrition attempt to construct a more comprehensive understanding of the factors influencing a studentâs decision to drop out of online courses. Alfred Rovai (2003), for instance, proposed a composite model to explain student drop-out containing two distinct stages. In the first stage, he considers two factors that are apparent prior to admission: (1) learner characteristics including age and gender; and (2) learner skills such as computer literacy and read- ing and writing ability. In the second stage, Rovai includes two after-admission factors, namely: (1) external factors such as finances, time constraints, and work commitments; and (2) internal factors suc"
