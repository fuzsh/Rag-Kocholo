        "text": "Citation preview\n\nEVERYDAY POLITICAL OBJECTS\n\nEveryday Political Objects examines a series of historical case studies across a very broad timescale, using objects as a means to develop different approaches to ­understanding politics where both internal and external definitions of the political prove inadequate. Materiality and objects have gradually made their way into the historian’s toolbox in recent years, but the distinctive contribution that a set of methods developed for the study of objects can make to our understanding of politics has yet to be explored. This book shows how everyday objects play a certain role in politics, which is specific to material things. It provides case studies which re-orientate the view of the political in a way that is distinct from, but complementary to, the study of political institutions, the social history of politics and the analysis of discourse. Each chapter shows, in a distinctive and innovative way, how historians might change their approach to politics by incorporating objects into their methodology. Analysing case studies from France, the Congo, Burkina Faso, Romania and Britain between the early Middle Ages and the present day makes this study the perfect tool for students and scholars in the disciplines of history, art history, political science, anthropology and archaeology.

This is partly a result of the incomplete or at least relatively recent victory in these sub-disciplines of the assumed pre-existing hermeneutic: that of semiotics and language-as-a-system. As a political historian, interested in both the effects of language on action and on the social history of politics, it seemed to me, at least, that historians had only recently started to integrate discourse, ideas and culture into their account of past societies, and that the material turn was even less advanced in its influence. After a little friendly discussion, we put in an explanatory footnote. This book is the result of a project involving primarily historians but also archaeologists, anthropologists and politologues, to investigate what focusing on everyday objects can contribute to an historical understanding of politics. It provides a series of case studies which re-orientate our view of the political in a way distinct from, but complementary to, the study of political institutions, the social history of politics and the analysis of discourse. It was made possible by generous support from the University of Lille and from the Institut de Recherche Historique du Septentrion (IRHiS), a mixed CNRS-University of Lille research unit (UMR 8589). The majority of the cases studied are drawn from France, between the early Middle Ages and the twentieth century, although individual chapters also consider the Congo, Burkina Faso, Romania and Britain. The University of\n\nAcknowledgements xv\n\nLille funded the initial three-year project ‘Everyday Political Cultures’ (2017–19) of which ‘Everyday Political Objects’ was one thematic strand. Together with IRHiS and the Institut National d’Histoire de l’Art, the university also provided generous support towards translating the 8 out of 16 chapters which were originally written in French. This translation was undertaken by Adrian Morfee and Anita Conrade. Most importantly of all, however, IRHiS provided the opportunity to develop this project in an intellectually stimulating environment, which is, moreover, far from being an ivory tower, tightly entangled as it is with a hard-working, public university. This book could not have existed without the scientific input of Gil Bartholeyns, Laurent Brassart, Manuel Charpy, Esther Dehoux, Elodie LecuppreDesjardin, Matthieu de Oliveira, Thomas Golsenne, Sylvain Lesage and Mathieu Vivas, nor without the benevolent oversight of Stéphane Michonneau and Charles Mériaux, and the technical support of Christine Aubry, Martine Duhamel and Julie Lemoine. Thanks are also due to Karen Harvey, and to the four readers for Routledge (including Rebecca Spang and Jonathan Spangler) for their incisive comments at crucial moments. Christopher Fletcher Lille, November 2020\n\n1 INTRODUCTION Useful things Christopher Fletcher\n\nThis book aims to show how everyday objects play a certain kind of role in politics, which is specific to material things. It hopes, in the process, to show how this helps us to understand what politics is. Materiality in general and objects in particular have gradually made their way into the historian’s toolbox since the 1990s. So far, however, the distinctive contribution that methods developed for the study of objects can make to our understanding of politics has yet to be fully realized. Much stimulating work, for example, has been devoted to the way that everyday objects and forms of dress become symbols of the bearer’s or the wearer’s political beliefs; how they can display demands for change, or opposition to change, in forms of government and social organisation.1 Research on the cusp of cultural, economic and political history has examined how changing political regimes inflected the relationship between political power and furniture design, for example, or the tension between perceptions of the value of money and the material forms it takes.2 Following the lead of economists and anthropologists, historians have tracked the flow of commodities for interactions, which since they concern power relations, sometimes on a global scale, might be thought of as political.3 In all this work, however, the meaning of the political has been taken for granted in a way which limits its usefulness for more distant periods and beyond Western Europe. It also risks introducing an element of teleology even when dealing with the eighteenth- and nineteenth-century West. This is a pity, since historians of politics have much to learn from the study of objects, and even more from the study of everyday objects. If we talk about politics in terms of our common-sense understanding of it, we tend to focus on phenomena which seem to us self-evidently political in a way which risks anachronism.4 In the present day, politics is usually understood either in a ‘narrow sense’ as denoting the world of politicians, public policy and the state, or else in a ‘broad sense’ denoting competition for control over any human grouping. Both have their advantages and their limitations as tools for studying past\n\n2 Christopher Fletcher\n\nsocieties. Focusing on the nearest equivalents to the former in past societies carries the clearest risk of anachronism. The search for the origins of the ‘modern state,’ useful as it has been for comparative purposes, risks privileging certain institutions over other social phenomena which were at least as important at the time.5 The solution frequently offered is to take up contemporary terminology: what actors in past societies called politics. One problem with this move, however, is that today and in the past, much which might be identified as politics has not been described by participants or contemporary observers as such. In the modern West, political scientists note the phenomenon of ‘avoiding politics’ in which agents actively avoid using language or raising issues considered to be ‘political,’ even when they deal with matters which raise questions of general import and even when they seek to influence government policy.6 In late medieval Western Europe, by comparison, the division between ethics, economics and politics was a commonplace of Latinate expert discourse after the twelfth century re-discovery of Aristotle, but it did not become at all common in the vernacular until the fifteenth century. ‘Politics’ was discussed in terms of negotiating common or mutual interest in a way which did not involve a specific, specialized, ‘political’ vocabulary.7 As this and other historical examples demonstrate, it would be wrong to limit our inquiry by only considering phenomena to be political if participants or contemporary observers describe them as such, especially as one common political tactic is to deny that one is acting politically. Falling back on the second, ‘broad sense’ definition, however, risks losing ‘politics’ some of its descriptive usefulness, for one of two very different reasons. On the one hand, a ‘broad sense’ conception of politics might be used to justify external intervention in areas which had been kept aside from politics in a certain society at a certain moment. One example of this is the feminist dictum ‘the personal is political,’ another the environmentalist claim to intervene in decisions which had been treated as solely scientific or technical.8 Indeed, in the sophisticated development of such a view of politics fitted for the present-day West, some political theorists have taken the identification of common interests and the raising of these interests to a general level as the marker of true politics.9 Politics, or rather politicization, is the act of introducing new areas of contention into a political sphere with a definite institutional existence in the modern West. In fact, such definitions are somewhere in between a ‘narrow’ and ‘broad’ sense, since they are themselves intended as political moves which seek to mark certain areas of human life as explicitly conflictual and hence legitimate areas for intervention. As such, they are not easy to adapt as a way of providing a means of discussing politics in past societies, although they do have the merit of underlining the permeability of this sphere. A more general, vernacular broad definition of ‘politics’ as competition for influence in any human grouping is certainly more adaptable, and hence less distorting of past realities, but it risks becoming so general as to lose the specifics of the political. In expressions such as ‘office politics,’ or in moves by social historians to broaden the use of this term to include all kinds of manifestations of ‘the social distribution and use of power,’ what seemed to be specific about politics in our\n\nIntroduction 3\n\nusage is largely lost.10 If all human conflict and competition is politics, then politics loses a large part of the usefulness it possessed when used more narrowly, becoming an adaptable but consequently rather loose label for conflictuality, competition and strategic behaviour in any human grouping. Yet if politics should not be described in our own terms, and cannot be identified in all cases by the terms participants used, it is difficult to see how else it can be defined. Despite repeated efforts by political philosophers over the past two centuries to provide a broader definition of politics which is not centred on the state; it has proved difficult to provide one which commands general acceptance. The liberal or ‘Weberian’ conception of politics as competition to secure control of the state, and especially its monopoly of legitimate violence, has often been put into question, but each new approach to politics then proposed tends to retain the mark of the particular historical circumstances for which it was developed.11 Politics among those, like most historians, who are not political philosophers, is still most often conceived either in a ‘narrow sense’ with reference to the state, or in historical societies those institutions which seem to resemble it, or else in a ‘broad sense’ as the enterprise of securing influence within any human grouping. It is here that everyday political objects come in. Everyday political objects help to reveal the articulations between the ‘narrow sense’ and ‘broad sense’ politics, in part because they frequently migrate between state politics, the specialized political sphere or what most closely resembles it in a given society, and other arenas which can be taken to be political latu sensu – labour relations; the family; religion; and various kinds of face-to-face communities – or which simply do not appear to be political at all. A case drawn from recent history, which emerged whilst this project was in progress, gives a first idea of how these propositions might be put into practice. On 30 July 2008, the French government issued a decree modifying the Code de la route to specify, among other things, that drivers must equip themselves with a reflective triangle and a hi-visibility jacket for use in the case of a breakdown or emergency stop.12 In practice, this meant that all drivers were supposed to buy these items and to place the jacket, in particular, somewhere convenient within their vehicle: the article specified that it should be ‘to hand’ (à portée de main). From then on, it was not unusual to see this item displayed prominently in more modest or utility vehicles, often over the passenger seat, in a way which quickly incurred condescension on internet forums and beyond.13 Ten years later, however, this everyday object suddenly acquired an enormous political charge. Between October 2017 and October 2018, the price of petrol increased by 15% and that of diesel, which had previously been much cheaper as a result of a preferential tax rate, by 23%.14 Between May and November 2018 an online petition launched against the rise in fuel prices received over a million signatures.15 Far from giving ground in the face of this protest, in September 2018 the French government announced its intention to increase energy taxes by 11.5% from 1 January 2019.16 As a result, the movement hardened, and in the course of October calls for a national blockade beginning on 17 November spread quickly through the internet and increasingly through\n\n4 Christopher Fletcher\n\nconventional media. It was during the build-up to this movement that the gilet jaune or high-vis jacket made its first political appearance. On 24 October, Ghislain Coutard, a 36-year-old maintenance technician, posted a video in which he took his hi-vis jacket from the seat next to him, apparently at random, and suggested using it as a sign for the movement: ‘That will motivate [people] and say: “Putain, we’re going to see ‘gilets jaunes’ everywhere on the dashboards, it’s a sign, it will maybe really move. It’s not just words in the air.” ’17 In the months that followed, the gilet jaune became the uniform of those participating in regular Saturday blockades at roundabouts across the country, and in the unlicensed demonstrations in major cities which accompanied them. It would also become the name of the participants themselves: they were the gilets jaunes. For the early twenty-first century historian or cultural critic, it might seem that what we have here is a semiotic intervention, an attempt to do politics by manipulating the system of signs (‘it’s a sign’), comparable to the role of discourse and language in many political contexts.18 Yet, quite apart from the reaction we might imagine this provoking from the gilets jaunes themselves, with their contempt for ‘words in the air,’ closer analysis reveals that this is not the whole story. The gilets jaunes show instead how a familiar object, primarily characterized by its use value, might acquire a new meaning and a distinctively political use. Hi-vis jackets did have symbolic connotations before the autumn of 2018, and these definitely contributed to their usefulness as a new political symbol. But it was ultimately the fact that such jackets were technically conceived to be seen from a distance, and that all drivers were legally obliged to own one, which suggested its new use and hence its new symbolic value. In terms of cognitive psychology, it was the ‘perceived affordances’ of this object, the things that it could apparently be used for, which suggested its new, political use and hence its new, political meaning.19 We can further assert, using terms which have become widespread amongst anthropologists, archaeologists and more recently historians, that with its political appropriation the ‘biography’ or ‘cultural biography’ of this particular object entered a new phase.20 This phase was distinctively ‘political’ in our terms, in that it involved intervention in what is assumed in modern Western societies to be ‘politics’ in the narrow or strict sense: the world of public policy and the action of the state. The gilets jaunes made this intervention, paradoxically, by insisting that they were exterior to the institutionalized political sphere, a characteristic which aligned them with the contemporary category of ‘populism.’ Indeed one of the characteristics of the movement of the gilets jaunes was how the leaders which emerged were violently rejected the moment they sought institutional legitimacy or agreed to attend negotiations with the government, even though many of them subsequently remained public figures.21 The case of the gilets jaunes is a useful starting point for considering a number of questions which have come to concern the historical profession in recent years as well as the contribution these might make to historical understandings of politics. In some circles, the steadily increasing interest in materiality, the study of objects and material culture in recent decades has been seen as a means of putting\n\nIntroduction 5\n\ninto question the ‘linguistic turn’ conventionally dated between the 1980s and 1990s.22 A ‘material turn’ has been proposed as one of the means to move beyond an alleged academic orthodoxy in which language is supposedly conceived of as both an all-encompassing and, rather contradictorily, infinitely flexible structure which must be negotiated prior to understanding any past society.23 In fact, the ‘material turn’ and the interest in objects is better considered as complementary to the ‘linguistic turn’ rather than superseding it or cancelling it out.24 Nonetheless, it does have to be recognized that focusing on the perceived affordances and biography of objects, for example, and, more radically, on their ‘agency’ does involve a more fundamental revision of our models for conceiving historical processes than is sometimes allowed.25 Objects and materiality cannot simply be incorporated into existing models of interpretation developed for the analysis of language and discourse. Objects, like images, are something different, and we need a different set of methods to understand them. This, too, has an important contribution to make to how we historicize past phenomena, including politics, in a fundamentally different fashion from discursive approaches, in a way that contributes in a modest way to understanding comparable phenomena today. The contributions to this volume examine a series of historical case studies, using objects as a means to develop new approaches to understanding politics. A number of themes emerged organically in the course of the presentation, discussion, translation and revision of these chapters. These themes are independent of any pre-existing theoretical schema, even if they draw on and adapt a number of existing theoretical currents. One of these, close to the notion of the ‘biography’ of objects, is the social mobility of everyday objects. Another, recalling ‘perceived affordances,’ is the primacy of use, and the different way an everyday, functional object might be political than a more exclusively symbolic one. Many of the objects discussed here were familiar both in elite and in ‘popular’ contexts, either simultaneously, since the objects were useful for a number of different social groups at the same time, or at different periods, as objects which were once associated with particular social groups were taken up and re-used by others. A number of the authors also draw on Alfred Gell’s theorisation of ‘agency’ as the capacity for social action ascribed to an object, even of the extent to which some objects may be considered to be veritable ‘persons,’26 but what is perhaps more marked across the volume is the affiliation of almost all the contributors with Gell’s project of demonstrating the limits of semiotics as a way of understanding the social efficacy of objects. Although some objects, especially art objects, might be conceived of by both artists and recipients as a means of transmitting messages through the mastery of a common system of interpretation, Gell insists that the symbolic value of an object is rarely if ever determined solely by its position in a system of signs.27 Similarly, in the chapters which follow, use is something independent of meaning, a product of particular techniques, social practices and specific historical circumstances, which can, however, influence and provide new meaning. In the process, useful objects provide both specific means of overtly exercising political power and also ways of exerting political influence while obscuring or denying the desire to do so.\n\n6 Christopher Fletcher\n\nThe political consequences of the social mobility of everyday objects can be considered from the point of view of the biography of a single object, or of the typical trajectory of a particular kind of object, or else as the biography of a type of object over the long term. Considering a broad category of objects over the long term in the longest chapter in this volume, Manuel Charpy begins by examining how the practice of reselling second-hand European clothes in the colonial Congo initially made their recipients seem absurd and inferior in Western eyes, as clothes were, from a colonial point of view, used in a way which seemed to misunderstand their symbolic value. How the political significance of Western clothing changed emerges as Charpy expands his perspective to the biography of this category of objects between the nineteenth century and the present day. From a marker of submission to colonial norms, high levels of expenditure on imported European clothing became a means to wrong-foot and undermine those who positioned themselves as their superiors. Applying comparable methods to the coloniser, Vanessa Alayrac-Fielding offers an explicitly political reading of the flow of commodities in the context of eighteenth-century British colonialism. She considers how objects such as porcelain tea things included teapots, tea tables and also fans with oriental themes were appropriated in eighteenth-century Britain, often by women, in a way which inscribed colonial politics in the everyday. AlayracFielding, in considering a broad category of objects, considers themes which run through these chapters, including the agency which could be ascribed to objects, such as fans and snuff boxes, perceived not merely as a tools but as an extension of the person who used them, conditioning in turn what they could do. In a theme which recurs throughout this volume, she notes the way that portable objects combined intimacy and familiarity with a potential for concealment and revelation, which made them particularly effective as a means of mobilizing political sentiments that found themselves marginalized. Moving the focus to a more restricted category of objects yields revealing comparisons about how the use value of an object inflects its political meaning in different ways as it is used by different social groups. Luc Bourgeois considers horns used as musical instruments, which also migrated between social groups in the course of the Middle Ages. At first associated with the aristocratic pursuits of war and hunting, and with the sounding of the alert on the walls of fortifications or on ships, horns were an important symbol of noble power in the central Middle Ages. A horn might be used, for example, to symbolize the gift of privileges of liberties from a lord to a town, with the original object or a copy of it being preserved and regularly sounded in certain towns into the modern era. Yet this symbolism marked a fossilization of past use, since with the return of metal trumpets and other more sophisticated instruments in the later Middle Ages, the horn no longer served to symbolize aristocratic power, becoming instead the instrument of pilgrims, shepherds and tradesmen. Julie Renou, meanwhile, considers a class of objects, rings, whose use and meaning could change over a human being’s lifespan, or over several lifetimes, as they were passed from one owner to another, accruing meaning with each step. Rings have tended to be classed in terms of the expense of the materials\n\nIntroduction 7\n\nthey were made from, ascribing high status materials to high status individuals, and cheaper stones and metals to lesser folk. Yet Renou demonstrates the social mobility of these objects. Rings made with copper alloy or with a blue-tinted glass paste ‘jewel’ could serve comparable functions of creating or strengthening social ties and power relationships for the noble women who feature in Gregory of Tours, or for the lesser individuals who were interred with comparable objects. In a study of the social mobility and political resonance of a particularly revealing type of object, Mathilde Semal examines the case of women’s fans in eighteenth- and early nineteenth-century France. An object with a simple use value as a means of cooling down its owner, fans had also long served functions as a tool of seduction and self-presentation strongly associated with the aristocracy, while also providing a decorative ground which could relay news and political messages. With the simplification of methods of production at the time of the Revolution, the fan, after a brief eclipse, returned as a means of transmitting a far broader range of messages, first pro-Revolutionary, and then counter-Revolutionary. In this case, use in itself did not dictate the message, but the fan evolved with the aims and tastes of its different owners. Even here, the fan’s technical composition as something which could be opened or closed, wholly or in part, which could be seen close to or from a distance, meant that its materiality inflected how it could be used, and what messages could be delivered, to whom and with what effect. Alongside the biography of an object, a recurring theme in this volume is the way an object’s use value and ‘perceived affordances’ suggest possibilities for the exercise of power and dominance, which in turn inflect its meaning, in a way which is not fully understandable from a purely semiotic perspective. Jean-Baptiste Santamaria, for example, considers how the political resonance of the coffer or chest as a symbol of princely or noble power in the later Middle Ages was inflected by its everyday use. Coffers served to stock money, which primarily meant silver or gold coin, or objects made of these metals, in a way which evaded paper accounting. Coffers thus served the prince as a reserve of power which no underling could regulate, and it was for this reason that the image of the prince dipping into his coffer to reward his followers was so powerful. Yet at the same time, this object’s use made it ambiguous and a source of tension, standing both for good management and the prince’s miserliness. Laurence Douny examines another charged political object, chosen for its ‘perceived affordances,’ which although it was initially mobilized to reinforce the dominance of the powerful, nevertheless invoked and continues to invoke the compromises and controversies which underlie their power. Drawing on interviews in the field, she analyzes the political resonances of a Fulbe spear in the village of Douroula in western Burkina Faso from the seventeenth century to the present day. Initially taken as a trophy by a Marka archer from a Fulbe horseman he had killed with a poisoned arrow, the spear was of a type adapted for the slave hunting that they practised, designed to intimidate or immobilize their prey. This particular spear, adopted as part of the symbolic property of Douroula at its founding, regularly used in collective rituals, became an ambiguous symbol after the Marka founder of the village was killed by his own brother, who seized\n\n8 Christopher Fletcher\n\npower in alliance with the Fulbe. Even after its replacement by a copy at an undated but acknowledged moment in the past, the spear has been used in regular sacrificial ceremonies which enact the political tensions and the political constitution of Douroula, in a manner which is inseparable from the spear’s original use. More simply, focusing on the everyday use of objects which acquire political meaning assists historians in their most fundamental task: understanding what was going on. Éric Fournier examines the seemingly arbitrary use of the Browning gun in the socialist newspaper La Guerre Sociale in the early 1910s to characterize ‘Citizen Browning,’ an initially mysterious socialist figure, perhaps a man or perhaps the weapon itself, who provides cool-headed resistance to the violence of police or strike-breakers. Fournier shows how after the generalization of the right to bear arms after 1885, coupled with the development of mass industrial production in France and Belgium, firearms became a mundane object for the last time in French civilian life. The Browning gun was both readily available, was advertised to have a firepower which surpassed that of the police, and could be easily smuggled in from Belgium if the import of guns was banned at some future point. It was this mundane context which made the figure of ‘Citizen Browning’ effective. Also with the aim of understanding what was ‘at stake’ in a particular conflict, Adrien Quièvre analyzes the use of mundane and familiar objects in mine workers’ charivari on the margins of a major strike in the Anzin coalfields, near Valenciennes, in 1884. Although this strike was marked by a degree of union organization which minimized the more spontaneous outbreaks of contestation or violence which had marked earlier movements, on a number of occasions miners who returned to work were targeted by charivari or ‘rough music.’ Drawing on the emerging field of sound studies, Quièvre analyzes the objects used to make the noise which accompanied these events. He demonstrates how, although their affordances as means of creating noise were important, the everyday uses of the objects chosen carried their own messages. In particular, they used objects associated with the domestic life of miners and their families in a way which reintroduced miners’ wives, sidelined by the new, exclusively masculine organization of the labour movement. Cauldrons, pans and clogs served to make noise whilst reintroducing women, challenging the division between paid work and the unpaid labour, which enabled it, and which was closely regulated by the mine company in its role as landlord. Footwear, indeed, has often provided powerful political objects in different contexts, again with clearly gendered connotations, notably by the way that the material existence shaped the body of the wearer, the way they moved and held themselves. Matthew McCormack examines the complex structure of political meanings attached to different kinds of shoes in Georgian England. Fashionable French footwear for men, which often had wooden soles, shaped how the wearer walked, or rather did not walk very much. Like female footwear for the well-to-do, which in this period consisted of delicate pumps with a limited lifespan, these wooden or part-wooden shoes were impractical for walking over anything but a short distance. Leather boots, on the other hand, were adapted primarily for riding, making the wearer mobile over the countryside or on the road but to a limited extent on\n\nIntroduction 9\n\nfoot. They were thus excellently adapted markers of rough, i­ndependent ‘country’ masculinity. As male leather footwear for the better-off developed, it became more practical for walking in town. McCormack suggests that this produced a more gendered form of footwear, which marked the moral and even physical superiority of Englishmen of the propertied or professional classes, over the French-influenced court, women and the bulk of the population who largely wore ill-fitting wooden footwear, or footwear with wooden soles, regardless of sex. In mine workers’ homes, in a protester’s pocket, on a man’s feet or in a woman’s tea set, political objects drew their power from the way they mixed with the everyday, the way they were familiar, ordinary, even anodyne. This characteristic of political objects extends to everyday things which might at first seem to be simple devices for the transmission of political messages which could be reduced to language or discourse but which turn out to have a particular material and even bodily aspect. Alexandra Ilina analyzes how the use of still film strips or ‘diafilm’ in communist Romania served to transmit messages which the historian can analyze as translating the changing nature of state ideology in the 1970s and 1980s, as Ceausescu’s regime gradually adopted a nationalist ideology tinged with medievalism in place of earlier more orthodox Soviet propaganda. Yet to focus on the message without taking into account the everyday medium loses much of their power, since these film strips had no associated audio: the script was read aloud, usually in a family environment, often by an adult to children, in a way which made them less aggressive and more immersive than a newsreel would have been. Jonathan Thomas likewise describes how the changing uses of recorded audio, notably in the form of vinyl records, inflected the way it was used by groups and parties seeking political influence in the ‘narrow’ sense, first on the left, and subsequently on the far right. While records were initially used to deliver political speeches, requiring conscious listening and engagement by the audience, politicized record companies increasingly made use of music as a means of transmitting messages to a less attentive audience. Initially used by groups close to the Socialist and Communist Parties, after the Second World War similar methods were adopted by the Société d’Etudes et de Relations Publiques (SERP), a record company directed by the far-right politician Jean-Marie Le Pen. Musical recordings associated with the Third Reich or colonial Algeria were published as historical documents, themselves submerged in a catalogue of political recordings more acceptable in mainstream politics. The aim was to make extreme right messages seem anodyne or at least commonplace in a period in which they were politically marginalized. The biography and social mobility of objects, their use value and perceived affordances, the way that they mix with the everyday and familiar, shaping bodies as well as minds: all these factors give them a political power which is stronger for not being uniquely political. Indeed, the way in which everyday objects seem self-­evidently apolitical or even anti-political makes them particularly effective as a means to intervene in the specialized political sphere or politics in the ‘narrow sense.’ As we saw in the case of coffers or a captured spear, everyday objects mediate agency in a way which obscures its originator. Faced with the same objects, multiple\n\n10 Christopher Fletcher\n\npossibilities present themselves for the interpretation of where the demands they make might come from. As Gil Bartholeyns discusses in the case of the household regulations of the king of France in the thirteenth and fourteenth centuries, human beings could easily be placed at the service of objects: drinking vessels, tableware, bedding and hunting boots. In a way comparable to but not identical with written regulations, the objects of the royal household carried an agency which might be perceived to originate with the king, since it was in his service that they were supposed to act. Yet as often in royal or princely rule, the king’s agency was considerably less immediate and even real than that of the officers, laws or objects which were held to made it manifest. Even in the case of the ‘seditious objects’ from the Restoration (1814–1830) analyzed by Emmanuel Fureix, there is nothing self-­ evident about ascribing the agency behind them to the human being who made them, the ‘artist’ in Gell’s terms. These objects, according to the police at least, had the power to provoke political movements and riots at the mere sight of a coin defaced to portray Charles X in Jesuit robes or a liqueur bottle decorated with the image of Napoleon. Here the ascription or ‘abduction of agency’ is very much the work of the police, even when the objects in question were clearly constructed with political intent: a statuette of a portly Louis XVIII, for example, where the top could be removed to reveal the bust of Napoleon.28 Such objects were deliberately mixed by the shopkeepers with royalist objects, or were kept to the back of the shop, so that they could argue that the agency was somebody else’s. Indeed, they were clearly sometimes in good faith, as is demonstrated by the sometimes highly imaginative misinterpretations of objects which fell into police hands, giving them a seditious agency which was neither the doing of the maker nor of the vender. This book thus examines a series of historical case studies across a very long time scale, using objects as a means to develop different approaches to understanding politics where existing definitions of the political prove inadequate. A number of themes emerge clearly. The first is the way that the biography of an everyday object or category of objects, and especially the way they can migrate from one social, geographical or political context to another, can make them important recipients of political meaning. Many of the objects discussed here were familiar both in elite and in ‘popular’ contexts, either simultaneously, since the objects were useful for a number of different social groups at the same time, or at different periods, as objects which were once associated with particular social groups were taken up and re-used by others. A second is the way that the use value of objects confers on them political significance and political meanings which are not just a function of discourse. Each chapter in this book demonstrates in a variety of ways that an object’s use is distinct from its meaning: use is a product of particular techniques, social practices and specific historical circumstances which are not reducible to language or discourse. But they also each show how use can influence or create new meaning, new symbols and new discourses. In the process, useful objects provide both specific means of overtly exercising political power and also ways of exerting political influence, while obscuring or denying the desire to do so. The everyday objects studied here acquired part of their political power precisely from\n\nIntroduction 11\n\nbeing ordinary, familiar and taken for granted. Their very banality or obviousness invited an inattentiveness and even an intimacy which facilitates the denial or the avoidance of politics. These qualities could be used by dominant groups, by nobles, conquerors and the winners of earlier conflicts, but they also allowed them to fulfil a role often neglected in analyses of politics. Everyday objects can be powerful receptacles for the possibilities for political action on the part of losing, dominated or marginalized groups, those who are not supposed to take part in politics, or who refuse or reject the political.\n\nNotes 1 See e.g. Lynn Hunt, Politics, Culture and the French Revolution (Berkeley: University of California Press, 1984); Richard Wrigley, The Politics of Appearances: Representations of Dress in Revolutionary France (Oxford and New York: Berg, 2002); Leora Auslander, Cultural Revolutions: The Politics of Everyday Life in Britain, North America and France (Oxford and New York: Berg, 2009). 2 Leora Auslander, Taste and Power: Furnishing Modern France (Berkeley: University of California Press, 1996); Rebecca L.

Sporting objects of adornment, whether for everyday use or for grand occasions, was one way an individual, family, or even social group could display wealth. Studies of textual sources have shown the importance of belongings, including jewellery, and of assets more generally, in aristocratic praxis. The accumulation, exhibition and redistribution of jewellery participated in the social processes that marked and confirmed the position individuals and families held in community groups.1 As Laurent Feller observes: ‘belongings and assets are part of wealth. Owning belongings which in large quantities constitute assets amounts to being wealthy.’2 If wealth goes hand in hand with power, the display of precious goods was instrumental in generating and consolidating the strategic positions of the elites. This chapter considers how personal ornaments were deployed in the ‘broad-sense’ politics of power struggles between and within aristocratic groups. Jewellery and clothing were convenient movable goods which could be displayed to express one’s wealth in a day-to-day context, outside the more highly charged ceremonies of early medieval social life such as betrothal, marriage and burial, all while playing an important role in these, too. Given that texts provide few descriptions of clothing and adornment, however, another approach is necessary to study the appearance of the powerful. Specialists of the early Middle Ages can instead turn to the material record, basing their discussion on what are generally regarded as the most prestigious tombs, thanks largely to the quantity and the materials of the objects found there. Archaeology has mainly addressed the difficult topic of the power of elites through study of funereal contexts. Yet although ways of analyzing the material record, especially necropolises and funereal practices, have evolved over the past 20 years, belongings have remained trapped in an interpretive dead-end, based on debatable assumptions. Power is said to be expressed by the ‘wealth’ of the\n\n14 Julie Renou\n\nobjects – by the materials, techniques and depositional practices used. Yet closer observation of the objects themselves reveals precious clues for renewing our conception of objects of power during the early Middle Ages, alongside the analysis of the specificities of the sepulchral contexts in which they were found.3 This chapter sets out some lines of enquiry into the implicit messages objects of adornment may communicate, focusing on the example of rings, a small, discreet accessory worn by both women and men.4\n\n‘Precious’ belongings In France, interpreting objects from the early Middle Ages has been based on an ideal, modern image of personal belongings, the legacy of an otherwise superseded historiography of ‘fine objects.’ Although the sources say little about objects of adornment, analysis of objects has been grounded in scattered references to socalled precious metals and pieces of jewellery gleaned from textual sources. The resulting picture has been focused on materials, and at times on production techniques, seeking to fill in the gaps left by early medieval authors. This has resulted in a normative analytical framework based on a series of dualisms – expensive versus cheap materials, original objects versus poor quality copies, and so on. Gold, silver and gems are associated with elites, while copper alloys and glass paste stones are ascribed to the lowly. While this is not wrong per se, it is an extrapolation which needs qualifying if we are to account for the variety of practices archaeology can reveal. Rings, and bronze possessions more generally, are presented as a residual background noise from those with a standard of living below that of the elite, unable to acquire well-made objects and/or objects made from precious materials.5 Textual sources do indeed demonstrate the importance of gold, silver and gems, all of which were highly prized for their prestige in early medieval societies. Copper alloys, meanwhile, were regarded with suspicion.6 Nonetheless, the material evidence allows us to sketch out another part of the picture. Copper objects do occur among objects of adornment belonging to elites, but not to the most powerful, such as royal figures. Although some copper alloy artefacts were manufactured with great care, they are cursorily undervalued in studies in comparison to discoveries in gold or even silver, despite the fact that the latter were far rarer and are not to be found at all among the items found in certain necropolises. When a tomb yields only a few objects, this is promptly interpreted as proof that the interred were poor. This leads to a distorted interpretation of the material evidence, focusing on exceptional finds which monopolize scholars’ attention, to the detriment of more modest yet clearly present clues. Copper alloy items are often described as copies, imitations or else as having been produced for individuals of lesser status. They are, however, sometimes unique examples presenting major formal and decorative variations which are indicative of the technical prowess that went into their manufacture.7 The skill of the metalworker needs to be taken into account in any analysis of such an object. This includes the mastery of copper alloy recipes to make colours resembling the\n\nRings of power 15\n\naspect of gold, together with the work on any settings or decorations. The fact that metalworkers held a privileged position in early medieval societies is in itself suggestive. In Gaul, such workers enjoyed protection and tax advantages, and their production was monitored and structured by royal power.8 Their skill in metalwork gave them an important role in competition between elites, and hence in the production of a category of prestige goods. When Gregory of Tours relates that King Chilperic presented him with a basin made of gold and gems, he attributes the following words to him: ‘I made that to honour and ennoble the nation of the Franks; but I shall make many more things if I am granted life.’9 It was long believed that this basin was actually made by Chilperic, but recent studies suggest this basin was probably commissioned by him, which would also have allowed him to present it as his personal work.10 We may view this episode as showing a powerful figure asserting his capacity to draw on the skills and metals of a qualified worker to fashion an object. The sole purpose the basin has in this instance is to exhibit the wealth and power of the person who commissioned it. In a similar way, we might posit that commissioning a jewel could be a highly symbolic act, even if the object was only an undecorated bronze ring. Individuals and families commissioned metalworkers, whose production was controlled and prized by elites. Irrespective of whether they were fashioned in gold, in copper alloy, in white metal alloy or in several different materials, their value was conditioned in advance, in part by the position the metalworker held in wealth competition among the elite. The estimated economic cost of an object and the quantitative study of artefacts deposited with the person interred are thus not enough to estimate their social status or level of wealth. Such approaches disconnect the object from its context and from the social framework in which it was produced and handled, which are precisely what constituted its value. For Maurice Godelier, precious objects must bestow and symbolize power, ‘materialize wealth . . ., independently of their various forms and actual raw materials.’11 Thus, the material characteristics of an item do not suffice to grant it the status of precious object, nor to endow it with power. The sociologist Thierry Bonnot sets out another potential line of enquiry: ‘there is no intrinsically valuable object; rather, objects are conditioned by actions – appropriations, exchanges, and practices – and by evolving judgements which depend on the context and history.’12 The value of an object may thus fluctuate, depending on the social framework of appraisal. Above all, it is not indexed on forms and materials. The characteristics of what constitutes preciousness have been fixed too rigidly due to the normative framework used by archaeology of the early Middle Ages for interpreting belongings. To get out of the interpretative impasse, it is necessary to look at the whole trajectory of the artefacts, from the origin of their materials to their deposit in the burials, including their daily use. The first difficulty is to get beyond the current appearance of artefacts when analyzing them. Unfortunately, the objects in question have by now corroded, and the alloys have lost their original colour and brilliance. All too often, the appearance of a jewel is submitted to peremptory judgement, whereas detailed analysis\n\n16 Julie Renou\n\nFIGURE 2.1 Ring\n\nwith woven shank in copper alloy, white metal alloy and glass paste. Unearthed in sepulchre 31 during excavations at Saint-Martin Priory, Niort (Deux-Sèvres). Now held by the Musée de Niort.\n\nPhoto: Julie Renou.\n\nenables us to determine the materials used, to deduce their recipe, and so to try and reconstruct the object’s original appearance. Jewellery from the Merovingian period can also show severe traces of wear and tear, which may lead to the arguably hasty conclusion that it was of poor quality. A ring discovered during excavations at the Priory of Saint-Martin, Niort (Deux-Sèvres) raises questions about our way of perceiving objects (Figure 2.1). This ring was discovered in sepulchre 31, dating from the sixth or seventh century, together with earrings in white metal alloy and glass cloisonné, and glass beads associated with twisted copper alloy wire, all of which was found at the level of the neck of the buried person. An iron buckle, another ring in copper alloy and a wild boar tooth were also discovered in the lower part of the sarcophagus.13 The composite ring had been made with particular care. A bright blue domed glass stone is mounted on a shank of woven rushes in copper and white metal alloys. The strands making up the shank were corroded, altering the colours of these metals, but the alternating silver and gold must have emphasized the depth of colour of the glass paste. The materials used are not those traditionally considered high status, yet this is clearly an accomplished piece of work. It is common to devalue jewels decorated with glass stones in comparison to those mounted with gems. Although it is true that gems would have involved greater economic cost to procure, this analysis needs to be qualified. Presenting glass stones solely as cheaper alternatives forestalls the interpretation of objects,\n\nRings of power 17\n\nhindering debate by enclosing it in binary terms. Certain important aspects of this material are thus ignored. A more promising approach has been recently suggested in discussion of the materials used in certain beads of blue glass. In many cases, their colouring was obtained using zaffre, an oxide obtained by calcinating cobalt, which has been extensively studied by François Delamare.14 These glass pastes are an intense deep blue, like that on the ring from the Priory of Saint-Martin, Niort. By comparing textual, archaeological and archaeometric data, Delamare has documented the use of cobalt blue glass from the beginnings of its fabrication until production ended in the nineteenth century. He proves that the blue glass used in Western Europe up until the twelfth century was imported from the eastern Mediterranean, from what is now the Syrian and Palestinian coast.15 For the early Middle Ages, this blue glass was thus imported or else recovered from items imported earlier. Much the same can be said of beads and garnets from what is now India and Pakistan.16 In addition to showing that these products were imported from the Syrian and Palestinian coast, study of cobalt blue glass beads also indicates that these ‘zaffre stones’ were viewed very positively during the Middle Ages.17 In writings attributed to the monk Theophilus Presbyter, descriptions of Byzantine blue glass draw on vocabulary evoking gems and sapphires, and combining various materials ‘indeed the Greeks make with the same sapphire stones precious chalices for drinking, decorating them with gold in this way.’18 For Grodecki, this refers to ‘zaffre’ blue glass employed to ‘imitate gems.’19 Writing in around 1145, Abbot Suger likewise described the stained glass installed at Saint-Denis as follows: ‘[these stained-glass panels] are very precious due to the marvellous execution of the painted glass and to the material of the zaffres.’20 Suger thanked God for having allowed him to procure sufficient quantities of this blue glass. For the early Middle Ages, it is possible that workers obtained glass by recycling old objects, as Theophilus’ remarks suggest, but it is also possible that they were imported from the Syrian and Palestinian coast. As with garnets and beads from the Indian subcontinent, obtaining such products relied on expensive organization and distant contacts. In this context, it is difficult to argue that the use of blue glass pastes, and glass paste objects more generally – including beads – were merely low-cost alternatives for more valuable materials. The mounting of a bead from India on a ring discovered in sepulchre 89 at Chasseneuil-sur-Bonnieure (Charente), dating from the fifth or sixth century, suggests we should adopt a different perspective on glass objects.21 The position of the bead is not, as might be expected, connected to other beads around a necklace. It was thus mounted for some other purpose. Whether or not it was used to replace a missing element, it was positioned in such a way as to exhibit its function as a bead, since the perforation is visible. It should be noted that it is unlikely that this position was due to a mistake by the jeweller, for the object is of undeniably good quality. It might be a bead that had particular affective meaning for the person who had it mounted. But equally, it might be a bead evoking the individual’s wealth. This component thus had a strong symbolic value, due to its origin or history, leading it to being mounted on a ring that acts as its setting. The limitations of existing\n\n18 Julie Renou\n\nreductive paradigms for analyzing precious objects found in studies of personal belongings suggests we need to take our enquiry further, looking particularly at the web of social practices in which they were placed.22\n\nFor an analysis based on the cultural biography of things One fertile approach for studying material culture is to situate bodily display in the theatre of early medieval social representations. Rings were associated with rituals to create or strengthen social ties and power. If added to the pommel of a sword, a ring could evoke the place of the owner in a social hierarchy or mark the lines of fidelity linking domini and their affiliates. Rings also publicly announced the creation of a union in the Roman Catholic marriage tradition.23 When the sign was understood by all, this probably led to the emergence of various types of recognizable ring. In any event, the choice of the type of object to materialize a ritual was probably made so that this jewellery could be worn and displayed in all circumstances. Whether in everyday life within the family group, or outside the group in any social interaction. In this context, we can introduce the question of the management of personal space by individuals when they wore ornamental objects. By applying the grid of proxemic analysis proposed by Edward Hall onto the study of social groups in the early Middle Ages, we raise interesting points about the display of objects.24 This approach takes the individual’s management of personal space as a cultural product, allowing us to pose the question of how ‘objects are lived,’ to paraphrase Jean Baudrillard: the gestures attached to an object, the awareness that the wearer has of the jewel when he or she wears it.25 Although we are ignorant of certain key facts, here, such as people’s postures or the evocative sounds of objects, we may try to piece together the mosaic of practices involved in wearing rings during this period. For example, at what time of the day were rings worn, or on the contrary, were they sometimes removed? On which social occasions where they intended to adorn the hands? Were some rings only worn within the family group, in public, or outside the immediate community? Taking into account the wide range of practices that may have varied between socio-cultural groups, we can see that rings, which are small objects, present many advantages, such as the fact that they can be easily removed or put back on again, depending on the context and the occasion. It is also easy to imagine that a ring made of a shiny material might easily perceived by seen by the wearer’s interlocutors, even at a distance from them. Byzantine betrothal rings, from the Roman Catholic tradition, are a telling example of what can be analysed from this perspective. The documented artefacts date from late antiquity, but this type of ring was probably still worn at the very beginning of the Middle Ages in highly Romanized areas such as the south of the Gaul.26 The head of the ring bears portraits of the betrothed, as in this example found in Bordeaux in the nineteenth century (Figure 2.2). The shank of this gold ring bears an inscription picked out in niello, NEMFYDI VIVAS, which may be taken as NYMPHIDIUS VIVA, thus corresponding to the\n\nRings of power 19\n\nFIGURE 2.2 Gold\n\nring dating from the fourth century. Musée d’Aquitaine, Bordeaux.\n\nPhoto: by Lysiane Gauthier, Mairie de Bordeaux.\n\nname Nymphidius followed by viva (in deo).27 Its polygonal shape surmounted by the portraits, is clearly inspired by Byzantine engagement rings. Note that when the ring was worn, the inscription was not visible, as it was partly hidden by the wearer’s fingers. Traces of wear and tear on Byzantine examples tend to prove that they were worn over long periods of time: the wearing of these rings was therefore not reserved for the engagement rite. The object became a permanent sign of the commitment which lead to its creation. The heads of these rings could have a sigillary function: if they were worn by the wife, it was probably a copy of the seal of the husband.28 For some signet rings, it is doubtful how far such a ring could actually have been used for the purposes of applying a seal. It perhaps served more as an evocation of the capacity to apply a seal, rather than as a functioning tool-jewel. Although Roman and Germanic marriage traditions apparently co-existed in the early Middle Ages, this type of ring dropped out of use in southwest Gaul over the course of the fifth century. Inscriptions, in particular, were no longer displayed on the body of the ring, but were instead located on its head, clearly visible when the object was worn – although they could still be hidden if necessary, by turning the ring. Moreover, no ring discovered in Gaul from this period bears an inscription on the inside of the shank – the circular body of the ring. The development of messages in this hidden location apparently appeared later. The fact that these were usually intimate messages, for example expressing devotion and love towards a person, must certainly be understood as a function of the secret aspect of this location, hidden from indiscreet glances. The first description of the Christian marriage rite in Gaul dates from the eleventh century, but does not mention a ring.29 The practice of giving a ring during the wedding rite, as opposed to on betrothal, has not\n\n20 Julie Renou\n\nbeen dated, but it apparently became established during the Carolingian period, as attested by textual allusions to wedding ceremonies.30 Being endowed with no legal significance, the components and forms of the rite were left to custom, depending on who was getting married, on the clergy involved or on the region. It was not until the thirteenth century that descriptions of Christian betrothal rites mention the gift of a ring.31 It was during this period that the church extended its authority over matrimonial unions, asserting a legal monopoly over the rite and instating the gift of a ring as one step in the ritual.32 Archaeology allows us to observe the adoption of the ring as part of the marriage rite through the analysis of sepulchres. In southwest Gaul, men and women were buried with rings. We are, however, unable to ascertain their function since the position where these objects were deposited does not provide any conclusive evidence, and nor do variations in form between these rings.33 Indeed, it is plausible that this type of ring may have figured among gifts offered during betrothal festivities in both the Roman Catholic and the Germanic tradition. The ring could thus represent the union of two families, with the display of high-quality jewels on the hands of the betrothed couple serving to evoke the emerging power of the two groups. The same could also be said of rings offered during the marriage rite. In this case, the form and materials might vary depending on the owners, with the object becoming a way of claiming a particular social status – be it coveted, in the process of being acquired, or attained – and not merely a sign publicly announcing the commitment as desired by the church. This leads to a question which is worth pursuing further. In such contexts, it seems difficult to imagine that such objects could be exclusively reserved for women.\n\nWere rings for women? Rings discovered in funereal contexts are commonly presented as feminine objects, on the grounds that they are often associated with personal belongings that we think of as being the appanage of women during the early Middle Ages. Sometimes indeed, it has been suggested that if a ring was discovered at the level of the left hand, then it signified the deceased’s matrimonial undertaking. Depending on the materials from which objects of adornment are made, the sepulchre might then be described as the rich tomb of an aristocratic lady. On the other hand, when the ring is not associated with attributes thought of as masculine, such as swords, there is a reluctance to see it as a symbol of power. Instead, it is seen merely as an expression of wealth, except in exceptional cases, such as that of sepulchre attributed to Queen Aregund (d. c. 380), wife of Chlothar I and mother of Chilperic I.34 Once again, only sepulchres considered to belong to the most powerful individuals receive particular attention, and in other cases archaeological clues tend to be neglected. It would thus be interesting to reconsider the common idea that rings were primarily reserved for women. The reality is apparently less marked than the historiography might suggest. Recent studies advocate systematically comparing data\n\nRings of power 21\n\nfrom observations of biological anthropology with those from analysis of belongings. But at times it can be difficult to apply this method due to the state of conservation of the bones, and a fortiori for older data from the nineteenth and early twentieth century. For southwest Gaul, what analysis of gender primarily reveals is the large number of gaps in the data, due to the absence of gender diagnosis and/ or the poor state of conservation of the skeleton (Figure 2.3). Putting aside these caveats, it is however possible to consider the available data for individuals deposited, adorned with rings, and those for whom objects were placed with the corpse in the sepulchre illustrated in figure 2.3. It can be seen that men were buried with rings at the level of their hands, just like women. It should be noted that rings are rarely found on phalanxes, and so the ring may have been deposited in or near the hand of the deceased. In all cases, it may or may not have been a gift to the interred. The observed proportions of men and women buried with objects of digital adornment rules out the possibility that rings were used exclusively by women. Furthermore, observation of belongings found together in sepulchres tends to suggest that objects were deposited in greater number and variety in women’s tombs than in men’s tombs. Whereas archaeology does not allow us to go further in the gendered interpretation of objects of adornment, the textual sources do provide some clues. Observation of the various rites marking the life of an aristocratic woman reveal the importance of precious goods used for adornment, including clothing and clothing accessories, both for the woman as an individual and for the image of her family. The life of an aristocratic woman was punctuated by various rites during which she obtained, displayed and redistributed her jewels, depending on the status being acquired or lost.35 We have already looked at betrothals, in which objects of\n\nRenou 2018, proportion of women and men buried with rings in southwest Gaul 23\n\n7\n\n119\n\nWomen FIGURE 2.3 Proportion\n\nMen\n\nIndeterminate\n\nof women and men buried with rings during the early Middle Ages in southwest Gaul.\n\n22 Julie Renou\n\nadornment played an important role, since it was a matter of proving the family’s power to the future spouse. Isabelle Cartron has documented the role adornment played in constructing the aristocratic aesthetic during the early Middle Ages, and its omnipresence in the various stages and rites marking an individual’s life. In this group at that time, when a woman was widowed, she lost her status as a spouse and was socially marginalized, ‘in a state of symbolic death.’36 The wife of the Frankish dux Rauching (d. 587), for example, on being informed of her husband’s death by one of his servants, gave away her jewels and took refuge in a basilica.37 Casting off belongings was a characteristic both of widowhood and of entering a convent. A woman had to abandon her finery on leaving secular life to devote herself to prayer, passing from the protection of her family to that of a religious community.38 A widow, too, might be deprived of some of her goods, which could be confiscated, and lose the protection of her kin.39 After a certain lapse of time, the length of which is hard to determine, she was then able to return to society and remarry. Ultimately, the woman, protected by her kin and/or by the institution of wergeld, was an asset for families, since she provided a convenient way to display their power and wealth – actual or aspired to – and of protecting precious goods entrusted to her. In a social frame which was intrinsically bound up with and indissociable from the economic frame, objects and especially jewels for display played a role in establishing hierarchies between individuals. Elites used various means to define themselves. Female adornment was a convenient way of reinforcing the ties between protagonists in a social group which stood out for its wealth – or the possibility some had of evoking this wealth – by facilitating their identification within this group, while at the same time differentiating them from the rest of the community. As the sociologists Boltanski and Thévenot note, discussing social frames where an object’s economic value does not determine its social value: ‘objects are not apprehended in their specific grandeur, as is the case in the industrial world, but mainly as partaking in establishing hierarchical relationships between people and as enabling their grandeur to be recorded, thereby facilitating their identification during encounters.’40 This seems to fit the social use of objects of adornment in the contexts we are concerned with here: it is not just economic value that counts, but an object’s capacity to mark and even to establish hierarchical relationships between individuals and groups. What matters is thus not so much the gender of the object as the use of the object by a specific gender during occasions that were part of elite practices. Adorning a woman with signs evoking power and wealth was a way of displaying, consolidating or laying claim to the right to these privileges. Hence, this interpretation provides a different way of thinking about jewels deposited in sepulchres, as funerals are just one among many rites marking the various changes in a woman’s status. This ceremony was as important to her as it was to her family, as it offered a way of displaying power and ambition.41 While it is not certain that fewer men wore this type of jewel, it is plausible that depositing their rings in sepulchres did not bear the same symbolic value or interest for them as it did for women.\n\nRings of power 23\n\nObjects with a past: the memory of ancestors Aristocratic women did not just wear objects of adornment; they were placed in charge of part of the family treasure. These objects were vectors of memory, forming a bond with ancestors whose memory was vested in them and assiduously maintained. A memory object keeps time at bay. Its materiality represents the family’s origin myth together with its power rooted in successive generations. They were thus personal jewels whose sentimental value was additional to their economic value and to their capacity to demonstrate power, where this included not only the family’s power but also that of the woman wearing the object. Sylvie Joye has worked on the notion of the power of aristocratic women and how it could be actualized.42 Adornment is one such instrument of power, and part of the construction of the feminine aristocratic aesthetic. Williams and Hamerow have demonstrated this for southern England, emphasizing the importance of memory objects entrusted to women’s keeping.43 When placed in a sepulchre near a deceased woman, these objects asserted the family’s power, as Cristina La Rocca has shown for the region of Lombardy.44 Study of the material record in southwest Gaul supports these observations, particularly thanks to hitherto largely neglected clues, namely the wear on objects and any alterations or repairs prior to being deposited. In an article about the sepulchre he attributes to Queen Aregund, Michel Périn discusses the state of objects deposited in the tomb near the deceased,45 insisting on marks of wear, ‘clumsy repairs,’ the presence of ‘fake’ objects, and missing components on certain jewels which lacked garnets on being deposited.46 He dismisses the hypothesis that it was economic reasons which led the deceased’s family to deposit her with these ‘mismatching’ and damaged objects, first because he thinks that it is a royal sepulchre, and second because the deceased was buried in luxurious clothing. He thus imputes these aesthetic anomalies to the queen’s decision: ‘It would thus seem that Aregund simply chose to be buried with jewels that were dear to her and that she had worn a lot.’47 This remark, which deserves critical attention, is representative of how repaired and damaged jewels are generally interpreted on the rare occasions when they are even mentioned. Proportionally, rings in southwest Gaul were repaired less frequently than fibulae, buckle plates, or aglets.48 Out of the 200 rings in documented archaeological contexts, 21 were deposited in incomplete or fragmented form. Only one ring discovered at Sergeac (Dordogne) shows proven signs of repair. Such rings are thus a promising field of enquiry. It should be noted that 18 rings were still functional when deposited, with only three missing such extensive parts that they could no longer be placed around a finger. Despite this, the rings were deposited at the level of the hands. The disrepair was of various types: in four cases the shank of the ring was broken, seven had gaps in the setting, and ten had no head, despite this being the most visible part when someone wears a ring (Figure 2.4). Although this ring has completely lost its upper part, the copper alloy solder is still visible. These two solder points once secured the head to the shank. The head\n\n24 Julie Renou\n\nFIGURE 2.4 Ring\n\nin white metal alloy with a missing head. Discovered in sepulchre 84 during excavations at the Priory of Saint-Martin, Niort (Deux-Sèvres). Held by the Musée de Niort.\n\nPhoto: Julie Renou.\n\nwas not discovered during excavations, suggesting that the ring was deposited in this state. It should be noted that in certain cases organic parts might have disintegrated due to various taphonomic mechanisms following their interment. On the other hand, certain rings discovered in excavation do show traces of proven wear, visible repairs and missing parts. Much like the sepulchre said to be Aregund’s (and hence a royal burial), sepulchres seen as less prestigious do also contain fragmented objects deposited in them. Since this practice can be observed at all levels of the social hierarchy, it seems less clear that such deposits were simply motivated by economy or by the attachment of the deceased to the jewels, among people for whom these objects would have been precious economically as well as for other reasons. There are also reasons to doubt that visible repairs to these jewels should be attributed simply to the inexperience of the worker who made them, since repairs too had an economic cost. It is surprising that studies of personal belongings are based on lists of wealth in textual sources but rarely refer to the importance of old objects handed down. In the present day, damaged objects, if not thrown away, might be repaired or recycled. The aim of such interventions is to transform an object and/or to remove the marks left by the passage of time. But this would not have been the case for precious objects crystallizing a status, alliance, social rank or power during the early Middle Ages. This ties in with Régine Le Jan’s observations in 2003 about the precious nature of Constantine’s crown, given by the pope in 816 to Louis the\n\nRings of power 25\n\nPious: it ‘is not precious solely because it reputedly belonged to the first Christian emperor, but because the latter and all the popes who subsequently owned it were still present in the object.’49 Hamerow and Cartron have demonstrated the importance such objects had in building family memories and the role that women played in conserving them.50 It may thus be envisaged that they were perceived differently from modern perceptions of repairs, in ways forged by the conservation practices of their socio-economic framework. Traces of ‘clumsy’ repairs observed on objects might be explained by the desire to maintain the object in a functioning state. It was not the aesthetic aspect of the object which mattered but maintaining its function, although there are admittedly many instances of fibulae being deposited without any fastening, rendering the object non-functional.51 Yet, on the other hand, the cost of repairing objects of adornment would have involved an expensive outlay that could not be afforded. Why not melt the material down to manufacture another object or recover the metal? No doubt bec"
