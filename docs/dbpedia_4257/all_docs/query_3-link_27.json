        "text": "It was a freezing cold January afternoon in 2011 when I met Bob Hoskins on an industrial estate in west London. The air stank of sewage, Heathrow-bound planes thundered overhead and Hoskins snuffled and coughed his way around the set.\n\nIt is a cliché that actors come alive when the cameras roll but Hoskins was very much alive when shivering in a warehouse waiting his turn, when chatting to everyone from his co-stars to a random caterer and, of course, when the director called \"action\".\n\nI'm not claiming any special insight into his character from one brief encounter for a Guardian feature but a day on set is usually long enough to distinguish salt-of-the-earth types from more self-absorbed actors who can turn on the charm for a quick interview. Hoskins, as you would expect, was very much of the former school.\n\nHe may have had flu \"up to the eyebrows\" (which weren't very high) but he oozed charisma and was the life-and-soul of the production, a low-budget film set during the Wapping strikes called Outside Bet. Even its star seemed to have doubts about the six-week shoot but he did not flag, and put all his considerable energy into it, despite the makers only being able to afford him for three weeks (which in practice meant he worked twice as hard).\n\nWhen he declared he was \"knackered\" and \"if I survive this movie it's gonna be a miracle\" he said it in such good spirits that I didn't believe him. At 68, he didn't seem remotely frail, and exhibited no signs of Parkinson's, although the fact that he talked of how filmmakers would phone him and morbidly promise \"a cracking little swansong for you\" – as if each film would be one of his last – seems eerie in retrospect.\n\nI was surprised when he announced his retirement from films 18 months later. It was obvious that he cherished even the most unglamorous days on set, and so he must have been more ill than he publicly revealed.\n\nFew people may remember Outside Bet, his penultimate credit, but of course his performances in films such as The Long Good Friday are indelible. And I'd wager that Bob Hoskins – warm, funny and full of star quality – will loom large in the memories of everyone who had even the briefest encounter with him."
