        "text": "Bob Hoskins was born in Bury St Edmunds in 1942, the son of a lorry driver and a nursery school teacher.\n\nHe was brought up in Finsbury Park north London and left school at 15 with one O-level qualification before going on to work various jobs including as a lorry driver and a window cleaner.\n\nHis acting career began in 1969 when he was asked by his friend Roger Frost to step in and finish a theatre audition in London. Hoskins got the part.\n\n\"Bob was a natural,\" said Mr Frost. \"He just got up on stage and was brilliant.\"\n\nAfter a selection of minor television roles he won critical acclaim in 1980 for a powerful performance as London gangster Harold Shand in the feature film The Long Good Friday.\n\nA few years later he was cast as George, the cockney chauffeur to a high-class prostitute in the film Mona Lisa. Hoskins won a BAFTA and a Golden Globe for the role.\n\nIn 1982 he had a small role as a rock band manager to singer Pink, played by Bob Geldof, in the Pink Floyd film The Wall.\n\nIn 1988 he received his second Golden Globe nomination for playing the role of Eddie in the part-animated feature film Who Framed Roger Rabbit.\n\nThe film proved popular with cinema audiences and went on to take $329m (Â£195m) at box offices worldwide.\n\nHoskins was married twice and had four children."
