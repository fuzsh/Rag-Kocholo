        "text": "David Nicholas Wilkinson, director/ producer/ founder and owner of Guerilla Films is probably unique in the UK entertainment industry in that he has been involved in so many different areas since he entered the industry in 1969 in a TV commercial. His first acting role was playing Ronnie Winslow in \"The Winslow Boy\" with Kenneth More and then later with Richard Todd in the lead role.\n\nHis film \"Getting Away With Murder(s) was voted No17 in The Guardian Best Films of 2021 in the UK (and by default the highest-rated documentary on that list).\n\nIn 1982 he pioneered the \" Reverse Co-Production\" with Keith Williams, BBC Head of Plays/ Films, making him effectively the first true independent producer with the Corporation.\n\nHis first production, To The Lighthouse, was nominated for a BAFTA Award. Films he has produced have won awards at the Sundance Film Festival, DocFest, the Galway Film Fleadh, the Grierson Awards, etc. In November 2023, he was awarded the first-ever Stirling Award for Achievement in Documentary by the Central Scotland Documentary Festival and the University of Stirling (home of the John Grierson Archive).\n\nFrom 1999 - 2023, apart from Alex Gibney Zero Days and Lasse Hallström Hilma, Wilkinson's Guerilla Films has only released British & Irish productions/ co-productions within the UK & Ireland, specialising in those films that other distributors thought difficult and un-commercial.\n\nSince Louis Aimé Augustin Le Prince made the world's first film on 14th of October 1888, no other British distribution company has ever made such a strong and wholehearted commitment to British films.\n\nSome of these films starred Anthony Hopkins, Alan Bates, Gary Oldman, Ian Holm, Penelope Wilton, Pete Postlethwaite, Harvey Keitel, Richard Attenborough, Ewan McGregor, Kenneth Branagh, Stellan Skarsgård, Jim Broadbent, Richard E. Grant, Susannah York, Rita Tushingham, Tom Courtenay, Joanna Lumley, Derek Jacobi, Bob Hoskins, Elizabeth McGovern, Peter Capaldi, Richard Armitage, Elliott Gould, Lena Olin,Tom Wilkinson, Michael York and many more. (See guerilla films limited's IMDb page for details).\n\nHe is also a writer both for the screen, newspapers, and magazines and co-wrote the book \"Ronald Harwood's Adaptations\" and has twice appeared on BBC's Radio 4's Today Programme as an expert on the British film industry."
