        "text": "Robert William \"Bob\" Hoskins, Jr. was an British-American actor, voice actor and film director, known for playing Cockney rough diamonds, psychopaths, and gangsters in films. He is best known as George in the British neo-noir mystery Mona Lisa, in which he was nominated for the Academy Award for Best Actor in 1986 for his performance. His other well-known roles include Eddie Mannix in Hollywoodland, Lou in Mermaids, and Nikita Khurshchev in Enemy at the Gates.\n\nFor Disney, he played Eddie Valiant in the 1988 Touchstone Pictures film, Who Framed Roger Rabbit. That stand-out performance gave his career an additional reputation as a player in family-oriented films, such as playing Boris in Balto, Captain Hook's first mate Mr. Smee in Steven Spielberg's Hook. His other roles include J. Edgar Hoover in Nixon, Johnny Scanlan in Passed Away, Mario in the 1993 Hollywood Pictures film, Super Mario Bros., Eddie Mannix in Hollywoodland, and Fezziwig and Old Joe in the 2009 animated film, A Christmas Carol, where he once again collaborated with director Robert Zemeckis.\n\nHoskins officially retired from show business in 2012 due to an ongoing battle with Parkinson's disease. He died of pneumonia in 2014 at the age of 71 and was survived by his wife and 4 children.\n\nDisney Roles[]\n\nGallery[]\n\nTrivia[]"
