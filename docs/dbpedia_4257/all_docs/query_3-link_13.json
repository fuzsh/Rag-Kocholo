        "text": "Bob Hoskins, the legendary British actor whose career spanned more than 40 years, has died at the age of 71. Hoskins passed away today (April 30) after contracting pneumonia. He announced his retirement from acting in 2012 following a Parkinson's diagnosis.\n\nBob Hoskins dies, aged 71: Tributes pour in for Long Good Friday star\n\nHoskins leaves behind an eclectic selection of film roles, having worked with filmmakers ranging from Steven Spielberg to Stephen Frears. Here are eight of his more memorable big screen roles...\n\nThe Long Good Friday (1980)\n\nProbably the greatest British gangster film ever made, Hoskins delivered an explosive turn as Harold Shand, a criminal looking to refashion himself as a legit businessman. John McKenzie's film has stood the test of time exceptionally well, having contemporary resonance in Shand's plans to rejuvenate the London Docklands to make way for the Olympic Games.\n\nMona Lisa (1986)\n\nThis Neil Jordan drama was the film that put Hoskins on the map and proved just how good an actor he was. Playing George, an ex-con hired to drive around a high-class call girl (Cathy Tyson), Hoskins played subtly with his 'gangster' persona and was rewarded with an Oscar nomination and Golden Globe and BAFTA wins.\n\nWho Framed Roger Rabbit (1988)\n\nRobert Zemeckis's live-action/cartoon hybrid broke new ground in visual effects, seamlessly blending Hoskins's determined gumshoe Eddie Valiant with flamboyant Looney Tunes-inspired characters. Hoskins had the responsibility of anchoring it all as the human lead, and he sells every insane moment with consummate ease. Green screen, pixel-driven blockbusters are a dime a dozen now, but back in the late '80s this was all new to actors - Hoskins deals with it all brilliantly.\n\nMermaids (1990)\n\nCher might be the marquee star of this cult '90s comedy, but Hoskins matches her at every turn playing the kind shopkeeper who wins Rachel Flax's heart. Today, a role like this would likely go to a polished Hollywood hunk, but Hoskins was a diamond in the rough, a male romantic lead you could actually believe in.\n\nHook (1991)\n\nSteven Spielberg's retelling of the Peter Pan story got a bad rap when it was released in cinemas, but years of TV repeats have meant that a generation has grown up with a lot of affection for it. One thing that's indisputable about this troubled blockbuster is its acting - across the board everyone is great, with Hoskins a particular delight as Hook's put-upon sidekick Smee. Dustin Hoffman was on moustache-twirling duties as the titular villain, but Hoskins holds his own next to the Hollywood A-lister.\n\nTwenty Four Seven (1997)\n\nDespite finding success in the States, Hoskins never lost touch with independent British cinema. Aspiring director Shane Meadows wrote the part of Alan Darcy specifically with Hoskins in mind - he agreed to star and his name helped raise the cast to make Twenty Four Seven a reality. Hoskins plays Darcy, a trainer who unites young men in a fractured Midlands town through his boxing club. This is Rocky done on a shoestring, but a film, like most of Meadows's later work, with immense emotional punch.\n\nEnemy at the Gates (2001)\n\nBy the early '00s, Hoskins was starting to appear most frequently in supporting roles, and one such memorable instance was his scene-stealing turn as Soviet politician Nikita Khrushchev. Hoskins was never the tallest of actors, but he had a tangible screen presence, no more evident than in the below clip from the film. You can tell he's relishing every single moment of his character's Russian accent.\n\nMrs Henderson Presents (2005)\n\nHoskins starred opposite Judi Dench in this based-on-a-true-story tale of a widow and impresario (Vivian Van Damm) who start up a revue called \"Revudeville\". Stephen Frears's saucy comedy is charming from minute one, and that's mainly down to the on-screen spark between Dench and Hoskins."
