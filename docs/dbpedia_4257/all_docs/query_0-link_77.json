        "text": "Any Beatles fan interested in knowing the band’s history knows, or should know, who Allen Klein is.\n\nFor those that need an increase in a rather dreary side of Beatleology, I’ll inform you of who he is.\n\nAllen Klein was The Beatles’ manager from 1969-1970 after original manager Brian Epstein’s death in 1967. Klein had managed The Rolling Stones and several other groups prior to The Beatles. Klein even negotiated for his clients to receive a reworking of contracts and a much-needed increase in income after previous contracts in the early years of bands had not called for them to be paid much. The Beatles, all except Paul McCartney, were impressed with his in-depth knowledge of music as well as the business that goes along with it.\n\nKlein is also known for his tough and brutal yet successful business strategies.\n\nKlein was the one who brought in Phil Spector to produce The Beatles’ Let It Be album, which angered McCartney because he was not pleased with Spector’s production of the album and his bandmates’ involvement with Klein resulted in McCartney filing a suit against his fellow Beatles to dissolve the band and their partnership. McCartney’s dissatisfaction with Let It Be also prompted his release of Let It Be…Naked in 2003, which was the Let It Be album as McCartney truly intended prior to Spector’s input.\n\nKlein’s decisions regarding the Beatles’ business affairs were questionable and Klein mismanaged the business affairs of The Beatles.\n\nThat said, Klein also worked as an account on the film Force of Impulse (1961) and, later, produced several films.\n\nThe Klein Film Festival is my collection of my reviews of films Klein was involved in.\n\nThe way that Marty (1955) was produced independently inspired the business model of Allen Klein, which he adapted for the music industry. So, I am including Marty (1955) in my Klein Film Festival.\n\nMarty (1955)\n\n“Marty” is a film which pinpoints on Marty Piletti (Ernest Borgnine), a Bronx-based butcher who has no love life to speak of. This is not for a lack of trying, but Piletti is constantly pressured by his family to settle down amidst all of his siblings being married with lives of their own.\n\nPiletti encounters Clara (Betsy Blair), a Benjamin Franklin High School teacher who is diserted by her date at the Stardust Ballroom. Clara has had the same luck finding love as Piletti has had. As the film progresses, the newly-found couple take things slow, work through each other’s insecurities over the societal status of their occupations, and build the foundation of their relationship, despite the jealousy and fears of others.\n\nMarty is an enchanging piece filled with heart, wit, beauty in acting as well as scenery, and well-thought-out relatability to viewers. I recommend it to all.\n\nForce of Impulse (1961)\n\nHere is another case of working class citizens looking down on people due to social status and structure topped with the ignorance of racism.\n\nTony Marino (Tony Anthony) is a football star athlete who is head-over-heels in love with Bunny (Teri Hope), who only gives him the attention he wants because he won a football game, even though it is evident she has feelings for him as well.\n\nBunny’s boyfriend, Phil (Jody McCrea) is watching over Bunny at the bequest of her father, his soon-to-be employer. This complicates things, but Bunny always runs back and forth between men whenever she fights with the other.\n\nMarino does not have the funds to take Bunny out, but wishes to show her a night out on the town. As a result of this, Marino takes money from his father Antonio (J. Carrol Naish) and the grocery store he is grooming his son to run in the years to come.\n\nForce of Impulse stays true to its name as temptation in the varieties of love and finances are all clear and the results of actions remain realistic in every way.\n\nWhile this film may have faults in Bunny’s portrayal and lack of development with her character, the musical backdrop of jazz crooner Lionel Hampton intertwined with the inescapable heartbreak of teen love and the false assumptions and expectations of a benighted society make for a film worthy of a view, despite its misgivings.\n\nA Dollar Between the Teeth (1967)\n\nSet against the eloquently-presented landscape of an abandoned town, which fits the bill and layout of any western thanks to the cinematic direction of Luigi Vanzi backed by cinematographer Marcello Masciocchi, A Dollar Between the Teeth centers on the Stranger (Tony Anthony), an everyman’s cowboy who gets a first-hand view of a Mexican murder. This prompts him to propose to the villainous Aguilar (Frank Wolf) that he let The Stranger partake in the robbery of gold.\n\nUpon his arrival to claim his share of the shiny goods, The Stranger is beaten, eventually retrieves all of the gold, and becomes a man on the run from Aguilar and his banshee of outlaws.\n\nThis all sets the stage for a western standoff that is as unsurprising as it is formulaic. True to the genre, A Dollar Between the Teeth lacks a desired focus on plot and relies too heavily on the overzealous action in every scene. This film is structured to follow a formula that leaves virtually no wiggle room for Anthony to enact his acting abilities let alone any worthwhile unexpected twists for viewers. It is a waste of time.\n\nMrs. Brown, You’ve Got a Lovely Daughter (1968)\n\nEssentially, a motion picture vehicle for 1960s band Herman’s Hermits to demonstrate their wit against the melodies and harmonies of their music, this film is more than the music. Mrs. Brown is a greyhound dog that Herman inherits from his grandfather upon his death.\n\nHerman (Peter Noone) is not very successful at his job at an advertising company, which instills little faith in him, and Herman and his Hermits, Barry (Barry Whitwam), Derek (Derek Leckenby), Keith (Keith Hopwood), and Karl (Karl Green) embark on racing Mrs. Brown. To raise the money needed to enter such races, the band tour local bars and clubs for the cash.\n\nMany things happen, which are predictable but nonetheless funny in a film with a rock and roll band, but the film has heart as Herman pursues Judy, the daughter of another, more wealthy Mrs. Brown and race competitor G.G. The two enjoy their splendid times until Judy’s modeling dreams cause her to leave London for travel.\n\nToss your notions and comparisons to any other rock and roll films. Any expectations you have may ruin your experience with a film deserving to stand on its own. Mrs. Brown does have a lovely film here and it is layered with humor, heart, and a well-written plot tucked within it a message to recognize the important things in life.\n\nThe Stranger Returns (A Man, A Horse, A Gun) (1968)\n\nIn this sequel, the Stranger (Tony Anthony) waltzes into a western town via his trustworthy horse Pussy. Almost immediately upon coming into this town, he witnesses a robbery. The object of this robbery is a gold stagecoach. His alias, which he takes from a dead man found rolling into town, comes in handy when he uses the help of an elderly preacher (Marco Guglielmi) for a classic standoff between the new friends and the robbers. This is a thoroughly enjoyable piece of work. Director Luigi Vanzi learns from his errors of its predecessor by allowing Anthony to write this story and add depth of a plot-centered focus. There is an additional plot twist that no one will foreshadow. Excellent film that exhibits the Stranger’s charisma and likeability magnificently.\n\nEl Topo (“The Mole”) (1970)\n\nEl Topo (Alejandro Jodorowsky, who also directs) is a man who rides into a town on horseback to discover the townspeople being killed. After abandoning his son and leaving him with the people, he leaves with a woman he calls Mara (Mara Lorenzio). Mara persuades El Topo to show his love and commitment to her by killing four masterful gun slingers. What is the use in all of this? The moral dilemma El Topo faces becomes the core of the film as we learn from each gun slinger and, in the end, process what life is truly all about through the relationship of an aged El Topo and his son Hijo. Jodorowsky is a genius when it comes to presenting surreal and bizarre atmospheres. The way he works the camera and film to present situations through a philosophical lens with a heavy dose of religious symbolism causes you to learn and take in what is happening in a way that few directors can achieve without hinting what is to come ahead of time. Don’t let the trippy nature of this film fool you. It is worthy. We all should watch Jodorowski’s cinematic efforts. We will learn a lot and him all the more.\n\nBlindman (1971)\n\nNever underestimate the blind. “Blindman” is about a blind cowboy (Tony Anthony) who has to tackle the job of retrieving several mail-order brides for miners. Don’t you know that you can’t trust anybody? The blind man’s business associates play him for a fool and sell the brides to Domingo (Lloyd Battista), a Mexican bandit. Blindman does what any cowboy would do. He tracks Domingo and his men down, leading to yet another standoff.\n\nAnthony plays Blindman marvelously. He gives the best performance that I have ever seen in any of his works. Ringo Starr gives a worthy performance as Candy, one of Blindman’s associates, but it is Anthony who is the star. This film becomes a little predictable as it progresses, morphing into a much-too-reliant picture on action. A great story is there, but I feel the unfortunate reality is that the focus is on the action and the shots of the camera.\n\nThe Concert for Bangladesh (1972)\n\nThis is a film a great combination of two concerts, the first of its kind. Viewers see the George Harrison-helmed benefit concert for the war-torn Bangladesh that features great music from Harrison, Ringo Starr, Ravi Shankar, Eric Clapton, and many more. Every shot, every angle, every song, and every crowd roar are all captured in full. I love this concert and this film. The only thing I wish is that more of a spotlight would have been shown on the behind-the-scenes aspects of this concert. Unless you were in attendance for the actual concerts at Madison Square Garden on August 1, 1971, something is lost for the cinematic viewer who watches this in the comfort of home or a multiplex. Something could have been added from behind-the-scenes to make the film special for the majority of us who were either not or or not alive to watch history in the making.\n\nThe Holy Mountain (1973)\n\nBrainchild of Alejandro Jodorowski, The Holy Mountain delves into many perspectives. An alchemist, played by writer-director Jodorowsky, is essential to this film after a man, representing Jesus Christ, sees our avarice world and enters various realms of people representing each planet in our solar system. Each realm is very different in nature.\n\nOne is sexual, another grotesque, and all are bizarre. However, they are necessary to show a new perspective. Upon the introductions in the realms, the newly-formed group, ala Jesus’ disciples, decide to no longer bind themselves to their material possessions. The ultimate goal for all is to seek and attain immortality on the Holy Mountain.\n\nThis film has a good premise and, as is Jodorowsky, is filled with religious symbolism throughout. Do not be alarmed. There is very little talking until about halfway through the picture. While this film is a bizarre undertaking and may take a few viewings to grasp, it is worth your while to seek out.\n\nThere are key life lessons that are just as applicable today as they were back in 1973. I enjoyed this film and have come to admire Jodorowsky’s insightful wit tremendously.\n\nThe Greek Tycoon (1978)\n\nInspired by the romance between Jackie Kennedy Onassis and Artistodle Onassis, The Greek Tycoon demonstrates how Theo Tomasis (Anthony Quinn), an oil and airline magnate who pursues Liz Cassidy (Jacqueline Bisset) after she and her husband, James, the President of the United States, visit his island amidst other political figures. Does he care that she is a married woman? Wouldn’t you guess, no?\n\nAfter the initial meeting, the film shows the tragic events in both of their lives that occur around the same time span that allow him to begin courting former First Lady Cassidy.\n\nI found this film to be an interesting depiction of Aristodle Onassis, and the scenery of Greece and London, in particular, are both amazingly breathtaking. Quinn embodies Mr. Tomasis well. From an outsider’s standpoint, this film did lovely in its presentation and execution of the Omasis (Onasis) relationship and marriage.\n\nI have not seen Without Each Other (1962) nor The Silent Stranger (The Stranger in Japan) (1968) but I would love to see them if I can find them. As of right now, I am unable to find them anywhere on the internet or elsewhere.\n\nInteresting facts: John Lennon and Yoko Ono loved Alejandro Jodorowsky’s El Topo (1970) so much that they were the ones who persuaded Klein to buy its rights.\n\nLennon also financed $! Million dollars of the budget of The Holy Mountain (1973).\n\nAlejandro Jodorowsky had recruited George Harrison to star in The Holy Mountain (1973) but Harrison had not wanted to take part in a scene where his character as the Christ-like figure would wash his butt.\n\nDuring his Yeezus tour, Kanye West layered his website with hidden messages pertaining to The Holy Mountain. West always had the backdrop of a mountain similar to the one in The Holy Mountain (1973) on stage during the tour and it seems everything concerning the tour references the film.\n\nDuring the recording of the All Things Must Pass album, George Harrison recorded a demo of “Beware of Darkness” with the lyrics, “Beware of ABKCO.” Klein Founded ABKCO (Allen & Betty Klein and Company) Records in 1961.\n\nHarrison’s Run of the Mill” is also a telling look at how the headache of the business that Klein helped turn Apple into in a business sense had an effect on the relationships between the four Beatles.\n\nJohn Lennon’s 1974 tune “Steel and Glass” from his Walls and Bridges album is directed at Klein.\n\nMy Ray of Sunshine is this:\n\nFilms can be formulaic and too heavily reliant on echoing the genre in which they represent but others, when thought out well, can offer unique perspectives and give an opportunity to introduce new realms of thinking and hopeful understanding.\n\nWhether it be anything from my HandMade Films Film Festival, my Vollmer Film Festival, or this Klein Film Festival, be open-minded and you may find lovely films and some that may be soaked in symbolism yet dedicate two hours to exploring a world that your mind may not have thought possible in the world until a certain cinematic piece came along.\n\nKlein with John Lennon, Paul McCartney, and Ringo Starr.\n\nLennon, Yoko, and Allen Klein in 1977.\n\nKlein and Jodorowsky in 2009 when the two reconciled after not talking since 1973, when Klein demanded Jodorowsky direct “The Story of O.”\n\nA comparison of the film The Holy Mountain (1973) (left) and Kanye West’s many aspects of his Yeezus tour stage set (right).\n\nThe Holy Mountain on the Yeezus tour.\n\nJodorowsky and Kanye West.\n\n[Photos courtesy of the Daily Mail, San Francisco Chronicle, Complex.com, and Mread.com].\n\nTo read my film reviews of every film produced by George Harrison’s production company HandMade Films, check out what I call my HandMade Films Film Festival at\n\nhttps://bobsrayofsunshine.wordpress.com/2015/01/16/the-handmade-films-film-festival/\n\nRead my reviews of every film that Jürgen Vollmer was involved with. Vollmer was a friend of The Beatles during their Hamburg days who photographed them frequently and, additionally, came up with their mop top hairstyle during John Lennon’s 21st birthday visit, alongside Paul McCartney, with Vollmer in Paris in ’61. Later, he became a set photographer for many French films when he moved to France in 1961. He also was a set photographer for many productions in Hollywood, California, USA.\n\nThe Vollmer Film Festival: My Reviews of the Films Jurgen Vollmer Was Involved With\n\nAs a follow-up to my HandMade Films Film Festival, I decided a while back to watch all of the films that Jurgen Vollmer was involved in. That is, all of them that I could find. If you’re a Beatles fan, you should know who Vollmer is. If you don’t, here’s the rundown.\n\nJurgen Vollmer is a German photographer who befriended all four Beatles during their residencies in Hamburg, Germany in 1960. He soon became a trusted member of The Beatles’ inner circle and photographed them often. He even came up with their iconic mop top hair cut and style. He, Astrid Kircherr, and Klaus Voormann have known them for an equal amount of time of 55 years and counting. In 1960, Lennon nicknamed Vollmer, Kircherr, and Voormann “the Exis.”\n\nVollmer moved to France in 1961 as a lot of Germans did not accept his style. He then became a film set photographer on several French films and, throughout the 1980s up until 2005, he was a film set photographer on films in the United States.\n\nI am going to review the Jurgen Vollmer-related films that I saw as part of what I am calling the Vollmer Film Festival.\n\nQui êtes vous, Polly Maggoo? (Who Are You, Polly Maggoo?) (1966)\n\nThe film essentially exposes the fashion industry and shows audiences how excessive and obsessive the fashion world is. Polly Maggoo (Dorothy McGowan) is a super model who agrees to be followed around by a film crew, which invites viewers inside behind the scenes of how fashion works. Grayson Hall plays magazine editor Miss Maxwell.\n\nMcGowan shines as Maggoo and it will make you wish she appeared in more films for french cinema. She had the experience of a model herself and no one would better fit into the role. The film is fast-paced, which makes it a little hard to keep up with. There are no real shockers about the fashion world but the film fulfills its duties in a satirical way and is a must watch for those who wish to be models or partake in the blood, sweat, and tears of creating fashion as a designer.\n\nLe jeune homme et la mort (The Young Man and Death) (1966)\n\nRudolph Nuereyev stars in this tragedy ballet piece as the lead man in Roland Petit’s famous ballet. Petit directed this French television adaption, which he also wrote originally and choreographs.\n\nPetit beautifully captures Nuereyev at his finest. If you don’t know the plot of Le Jeunne, it centers around a young man who is broken hearted by his unfaithful girlfriend and contemplates ending it all. He lets his emotions flow by way of dancing to Bach and his Passacaglia and Fugue in C Minor.\n\nI have never been an enthusiast for ballet, but I know its value. It is not something I prefer, but this film will resonate with its audience as I have recognized the beauty of the scenes and I think Nuereyev and his counterpart cheating partner Zizi Jeanmarie gave wothy performances with their dance numbers.\n\nI will say that the film leaves you wanting more. I admire what Petit did with his 1946 work 20 years later, and I liked the gentle way that the resolution was handled under his direction. He is a great choreographer who knows the direction he wants to take his work because he knows his craft. Any ballet dancer who worked with him was in the best possible hands. High praises.\n\nBenjamin ou Les mémoires d’un puceau” (Benjamin, The Diary of an Innocent Boy) (1968)\n\nThis film centers on Benjamin (Pierre Clementi) who goes to live with his aunt, Countess de Valandry (Michele Morgan) and Benjamin begins to be pursued by many women and a pursuer named Anne (Catherine Deneuve) could get Benjamin caught in a love triangle. I would call this film the portrait of the adolescent phase of life. Benjamin is a virgin who doesn’t know what he’s doing or what to do with his pursuers, much like many are their first time. Clenenti portrays Benjamin beautifully and exceptionally awkwardly, which captures adolescence. The scenery of this film is photographed and captured beautifully. Audiences are definitely able to feel the emotion and beauty of the surroundings and characters.\n\nUn Soir, Un Train (One Night, One Train) (1968)\n\nThe film centers on Mathias (Yves Montand), who gets into an argument with the woman he is living with named Anne (Anouk Aimee). Shortly after their brief fight, the two take a train to see a political event. While Mathias is sleeping, Anne vanishes. Upon wakening and exiting the train with Val (Francois Beukelaers) and Hernhutter Hector Camerlynck), the three encounter a village where they do not understand the native language. Ever still, the search for Anne is on. This film has delightful moments at its start, but as the film progresses you will discover the predictable nature that embodies each scene. The atmosphere is beautiful, but the story is not original or enticing. Although it will leave those watching with an important life lesson other than life is too short for a bad day at the cinema, this falls flat.\n\nProvidence (1977)\n\nProvidence is the result of a writing collaboration between playwright David Mercer, who wrote the film’s screenplay, and Alain Resnais, who directed the picture.\n\nThe plot revolves around Clive Langham (John Gielgud), a successful writer who is an alcoholic in the twilight of his years looking to write one last novel before crossing over to the eternity of Heaven.\n\nAll writers channel their creative juices towards different variations of people and the surroundings that they inhabit. For Langham, his creative flow draws inspiration from his family: wife Sonia (Ellen Burstyn), and sons Claude (Dirk Bougarde) and Kevin (David Warner). As the film unravels, dysfunctionality unveils itself, something present in all families in one way or another, and viewers see how their patriarch has played with their personalities via embellishments under the setting of his extravagant, white layered and goth mansion.\n\nEach scene throughout the progression of the film shows Clive imagining aspects of his novel being played out in his head against the backdrop of gorgeous French oceanic scenery in France as well as Providence itself, Louvain, Brussels, and Antwerp. The interior shots of the mansion display it’s affluence while the exterior shots epitomize the beauty of the natural world we take for granted.\n\nThe darkness of this film seen at times were striking inspirations evoking the work of writer H.P. Lovecraft.\n\nThe film is noted for praiseworthy performances from Gielgud, Burstyn, Warner, Bogarde, and Denis Lawson and Elaine Stritch. All who played members of the Langham family gave their all to the characters and their commitment paid off as it soaks through the screen.\n\nA major part of the layered charm is the immense symbolism painted within the meaning of the simplistic word, “Providence.” Symbolism lies embedded with author Clive Langham reigning control over his literary realistic characters in a fashion reminiscent of puppetry. “Providence” is the name bearing the entry of the gates guarding the mansion, and the scenery of Providence is wonderfully captured justifiably as the breathtaking location that it is.\n\nProvidence does a lot to make viewers think of how they perceive people and the emotions with which we associate our family members through the lens of Clive Langham as he writes about each familial character and cements his views onto how they are personified into the book. This is a revealing side to Clive and, often, shows that his perceptions of his sons are based on their occupations and conduct in addition to the experiences they have had individually.\n\nSome of the revelations in the depictions of his family via his mindset are sad but exemplifies relatability that we all can understand to a certain degree as we go into his head, to an extent.\n\nFamily life is the reason so many are inspired and each person in family dynamics affect a person’s life in both positive and negative ways, depending on any given memory as we seep through them like a photo album in the trajectory of reflection.\n\nI found this film complex in its psychological undertones through the perspective of a flawed man at the end of the end and I was taken with the lengths the film went to spotlight how one man and, in a way, how we all, handle perception. I found the inspirations of the environmental scenery which permeates superbly to go alongside memorable performances driven by passion and a seemingly glorifying sense of devotion to each character across the board in director Resnais’ impressive English film directorial debut, to be refreshing and encapsulated on film brilliantly.\n\nFilms are a window to the world and some, when done well, can further encourage us to realize the intertwining ways in which perception, and many other variables, play an immeasurable role in how we view and treat our loved ones, how we learn to treat the world around us, and create awareness and positive change when needed to enhance that very individualistic prism for the better.\n\nL’imprécateur (The Accuser) (1977)\n\nCorporations are institutions run on the notion of getting the most out of every dollar and making the most out of that dollar, mixed with expert handling of marketing, leads to success on a global scale that, often, drives people to their wit’s end.\n\nRosery & Mitchel is a company built with such numerical thinking at play. They are a miltinternational company whose executive is killed in a tragic car accident.\n\nA cloud of mystery hangs gloomily over the company as each employee receives threatening letters the very next morning, which causes worry around the Paris offices. Once the American outlet gets word of the bizarre happenings while the executive’s family mourns their loss, the American branch launches a search of epic proportions to locate the person who caused the executive’s final moments much too soon. That person is the accuser in question. Jean Yanne portrays the Director of Human Relations for Rosery & Mitchel, Jean-Pierre Marielle plays Roustev, Michael Lonsdale plays Abéraud, and Michael Piccoli deserves the most praise for his performance as Saint-Ramme, the high-up head honcho of Rosery & Mitchel who is driven mad by the corporation’s scrutinous manhunt for who is responsible for the crash. The success he once gleamed over becomes his worst nightmare as he, also, became more and more overworked and spirals into a breakdown that is a pity to watch but necessary to unravel his conscious as the film boils over in the search for the accuser in the sewage below the Rosery & Mitchel building and the toast of, I believe, good health toward Piccoli’s Saint-Ramme that makes the man himself wish he were dead or, at the very least, anywhere but his surrounded hospital bed.\n\nThe film gets progressively dark as it evolves, escalates, and intensifies but that seems rather fitting because the world of business, corporations, and cover-ups are dark, muddy waters of equal measures in our own reality.\n\nAmerican viewers may not get as much out of it as its French audience given that a vast majority of this picture is in French dialogue but the music at the backdrop is a thankful guiding light, along with some scene progressions, as to what is happening as the film moves along.\n\nI probably did not get as much out of this movie for the above stated reason but I got a substantial amount of the gist, which was enough to follow along through the music and the scenes but I could also tell the enormity of Piccoli’s character and was gripped by the level of emotion and ability within his performance. He is and was a treasured actor of our time.\n\nThe Natural (1984)\n\nThis film stars Robert Redford as Roy Hobbs, an up-and-coming baseball player with unique abilities on the field. He achieves his dream, but, way back in 1920s Chicago as he rises with the Cubs, he is lured by Harriet Bird (Barbara Hershey), who shoots him. Years later, while playing successfully with the New York Knights, the bullet still inside him from that infamous night causes uproar again. The Natural is, perhaps, the greatest sports drama in the last 30 years. It is certainly a standout in Vollmer’s collection. Throughout the movie, viewers see Hobbs’ triumphs and struggles in life as he becomes the man he ends up being by the end credits. This could also be a great film to examine for perspective sports psychologists. Redford deserved the Academy Award and Robert Duvall is exceptional as sportswriter Max Mercy. The film is based on Philadelphia Phillies first baseman Eddie Waitkus and his being shot by Ruth Ann Steinhagen.\n\nL‘Amour à mort (Love Unto Death) (1984)\n\nAt this time man named Lazarus was sick. He lived in Bethany, the village of Mary and her sister Martha. (Mary, whose brother Lazarus was sick, was later to anoint the Lord with perfume and wipe His feet with her hair.) So the sisters sent word to Jesus, “Lord, the one You love is sick.”\n\nWhen Jesus heard this, He said, “This sickness will not end in death. No, it is for the glory of God, so that the Son of God may be glorified through it.”\n\nNow Jesus loved Martha and her sister and Lazarus. Yet when He heard that Lazarus was sick, He stayed where He was for two days. Finally, He said to the disciples, “Let us go back to Judea.”\n\nSo when Martha heard that Jesus was coming, she went out to meet Him; but Mary stayed at home.\n\nMartha said to Jesus, “Lord, if You had been here, my brother would not have died. But even now I know that God will give You whatever You ask Him.”\n\nJesus said to her, “I am the resurrection and the life. He who believes in Me will live, even though he dies. And everyone who lives and believes in Me will never die.”\n\nJohn 11\n\nMuch like the Biblical story of Lazarus in John, Chapter 11, French cinema’s L’Amour à mort (Love Unto Death) is a picture about resurrection.\n\nIn this Alain Resnais-directed offering, Sabine Azéma and Pierre Arditi star as primary characters Elizabeth Sutter and Simon Roche, a couple in the midst of a blossoming romance cut short when Simon collapses at their home in the picture-esque atmosphere of Uzès, Gard, France.\n\nElizabeth begins to grieve through the immediacy of the trauma experienced resulting from his death and the subsequent visit by Dr. Rosier (Jean Dasté) while, also, informing dear friends Judith and Jerome (Fanny Ardent and André Dussollier) in the process of her loss over the phone.\n\nAfter Dr. Rosier affirms Simon’s passing to Elizabeth and leaves to go to the hospital, Simon suddenly awakens and is brought back to life. A shocked Elizabeth becomes so flabbergasted that she is at a loss for words and cannot bring herself to alert Judith and Jérôme, who she had called over the phone, much to their worry.\n\nSimon embraces the experience of death and resurrection as the profound impact that it is and, further, engulfs himself in his life with Elizabeth and shedding the seemingly shadow of a life he had led prior. He now has a new lease on life.\n\nHe throws himself in his archaeological work and passions, something that brought he and Elizabeth together in the first place, and sets out to do all the things that he would have never had the chance to do were it not for his eye-opening experience.\n\nAs Simon, Elizabeth, Judith, and Jerome all learn about the death of another friend, the driving force who introduced Elizabeth and Simon to one another, we learn of Jérôme’s viewpoints on suicide as the characters, once more, come to grips with the reality of mortality that all of us must confront in the grand scheme of life.\n\nAs the film progresses, viewers are lucky enough to witness the empowering and enriching strength of sincere love through the lens of Elizabeth and Simon while, along the way, we also learn to enhance our ever-evolving viewpoints on mysteries in life that divide our world.\n\nI have said before that film can serve as a gateway to change in the world and the prisms presented through character lenses in the cinematic art form should serve as a unifying force rather than one of division.\n\nThis film is beautiful on many fronts but I love the lengths to which the writing goes to to demonstrate that all things in life are layered with variations of perspectives. It all depends on your mindset.\n\nLove comes in many forms, opportunities present themselves in various mysterious ways, religion can offer a multitude of considerations on inner workings of how things are to be thought in accordance with beliefs and what is written, and even death bears meaning beyond realms of thinking. All things need not be coated in typical prisms of thinking let alone darkness. There is beauty in meaning that transcends a viewpoint of what many may previously have thought to have been usual.\n\nLearning to think with an open heart and mind can heighten viewpoints once thought to be beyond ideas of possibility and broaden the ways you can help to increase knowledge of newfound perspectives to the world that you inhabit.\n\nIt all depends on how open your heart is. After all, perspectives that we have on love and death should leave you filled with endless hope given that, in the end, we will all be resurrected and reunited for all eternity.\n\nThis picture does a wonderful job of portraying trajectories we all can learn from on a multitude of levels and the love between the characters in the connections that they have is something to be admired as they, and as a result, we, too, learn that all stages of life have endless forms and ways of being shown.\n\nJust The Way You Are (1984)\n\nAt some point in our lives, we all face occurrences in pivotal moments that allow us to face the truth about not only ourselves but certain situations we are dealt and insecurities we may have.\n\nFacing the reality of accepting the truth and no longer hiding but embracing part of what makes a person who they are is at the forefront of director Edouard Molinaro’s “Just The Way You Are.”\n\nKristy McNichol plays Susan Belanger, an up-and-coming flutist who is revered amongst her friends and the locals in the Boston area for her talents in the orchestra pit. Belanger does not find attracting the attention of countless suitors too hard but what holds her back is an insecurity she has concerning her bum leg due to an illness she has had since childhood.\n\nSusan seems to view her love life hopeless and she agrees to go forward with marrying her homosexual friend, Frank, who aims to get a promotion in his business and thinks a woman on his arm would look good and spike his chances.\n\nBerlangee’so father secures tour dates in Europe for Susan, who, while in France, ventures out into the French Alps on a skiing resort with her leg under the cloak of a cast in an effort for Susan to be spared no sympathy and be treated as an equal amidst creeping insecurity hidden beneath herself.\n\nUnbeknownst to us all, love finds us in unexpected territories in most cases. That is precisely what happened when Berlander meets Peter Nichols (Michael Ontkean), a photographer sent to cover a skiing event for people with disabilities.\n\nOver the course of a seemingly short time, Susan and Peter’s connection formulates in a bond which permeates joy and affection yet Susan tries to fight her feelings away as she continues to grapple with finally accepting herself and letting Peter in on the truth revolving around her leg.\n\nThe ensuing ending provides a worthwhile lesson for anybody battling insecurities. I, too, have learned over time that the best alternative is to realize that any and all insecurities are only a product within your head and communication is the only barrier to counteract such feelings. This will allow for healing, empathy, growth, and acceptance which, further, leads to loving yourself and others just the way you, and they, are.\n\nI enjoyed the chemistry between McNichol and Ontkean and I also think that Kaki Hunter’s performance as Susan’s best friend, Lisa, a dancer who shows her skills during orchestra performances, is noteworthy. Lisa Elliott is the epitome of the kind of best friend we all should feel so lucky to have and cherish in life. This film may not be for everybody but I loved it because it has heart, humor, structure, and the key message at its core that we all need to learn to be welcoming of love when it comes to us and, above all, let that very love lead in all that we do.\n\nCat’s Eye (1985)\n\nCat’s Eye is a combination of three Stephen King stories all revolving around a cat. A tabby cat is chased by a St. Bernard in an alley and nearly killed by a Chevy truck. The cat is captured and taken to Quitter’s Inc., which uses a bizarre method of horror to get smokers to kick their habit. These horrors usually involve the smoker’s family and cat and increase the more the smoker continues use. After escaping Quitter’s Inc. torture, the cat encounters a group of kids and is taken home by a gambler named Cressner (Richard Hays). A sticky situation of blackmail ensues for Norris, who must cross a ledge on the gambler’s apartment to avoid being framed with drugs.\n\nA bizarre string of events soon follow, which leads to the cat being adopted by Amanda (Drew Barrymore)but the cat is forced to sleep outside and is unable to protect her from a troll. There is a death that the cat is blamed for, which causes the cat, General, to be brought to an animal shelter. This does not stop General from protecting Amanda.\n\nThis all sounds ridiculous. Trust me, it is. What movie involves an evil troll? First-time viewers will discover the film’s mediocrity within five minutes. It is preposterous. Such a waste of the talents of Barrymore, James Woods, Hays, and all involved. This is one King creation that should have been shelved and destroyed before it ever saw the light of day.\n\nPirates (1986)\n\nThis ridiculous film pinpoints on Captain Thomas Bartholomew Red (Walter Mattheu). Red and his first mate Frog end up stranded on an island but it is survival of the fittest as Red tries to kill and eat Frog. They are rescued by a Spanish galleon but forced into slavery. Red takes control of the vessel as fellow slaves start to unite but Frog is struck by Cupid when it comes to the niece of a colonial governor. Red inspires many to steal a Spanish golden throne that his rescuers stole from the Aztec king. The film is terrible. It is from the creative mind of Roman Polanski. Polanski, ever creative, wastes his time here. This is something I would expect from Monty Python. Nothing is funny in any scene. Pirates was poorly made and is far too long for anybody. Don’t ever watch this film. I would rather be stranded with a raft in the ocean watching any Deuce Bigolo as opposed to this equal piece of garbage.\n\nRaw Deal (1986)\n\nMark Kaminsky (Arnold Schwarzenegger) is a small town former FBI agent called back into the agency to personally investigate the murder of Chief Harry Shannon’s son. This film is one of the few Schwarzenegger endeavers that I enjoyed. The plot and flow of the film were rather predictable but the role fit Schwarzenegger like a glove. Although he has gone on to replicate the same type of roles and he has been type casted, Schwarzenegger fits into the film’s scope as Johnny Depp would fit marvelously as Boo Radley in the remake of To Kill a Mockingbird that is within my head. If you are a fan of Schwarzenegger or action, this one is for you.\n\nMaximum Overdrive (1986)\n\nThe film opens with Earth passing through the tail of a comet, previously inanimate objects start to show a murderous life of their own. The film’s basis begins here. Machines come to life as the result of this comet orbiting earth. It is the job of humans to destroy the machines before the machines destroy them in the eight ongoing days that the comet orbits our planet. The machines take on any human or pet that gets in their way or challenges them. The machines stop at nothing. Maximum Overdrive essentially predicts how technology has taken over our world 30 years later. However, this film is insane, and that is not a compliment. If I had lived in Willmington, North Carolina as a character in this film, I would have personally taken the film reels’ contents, shouted at a murderous “Dixie Boy” truck, and watched in glory as the truck flattened this film with it’s wheels. I would have yearned for death if I had to experience this film as a character. King has gladly stuck to writing books and never directed again.\n\nGardens of Stone (1987)\n\nSgt. Clell Hazard is a Vietnam War veteran who trains soldiers for battle. He and his trainees work at Arlington National Cemetery, where he is denied like clockwork the opportunity to truly help soldiers the way that he wants. His desires come in good use when he helps the son of a war buddy. The son, Jackie Willow, is taken under Sgt. Clell’s wing and becomes his protegee. James Caan gives an excellent performance as Sgt. Clell. Gardens of Stone offers, probably, the most authentic portrait of some of the training that soldiers go through as well as the way they were thrown into the Vietnam battlefield. Gardens of Stone is an excellent picture with skill, emotion, authenticity, and heartache with great, standout performances from James Earl Jones, Anjelica Huston, and D.B. Sweeney as Jackie Willow. This is among director Francis Ford Coppola’s best.\n\nWho’s That Girl? (1987)\n\nNikki Finn (Madonna) is an ex-convict newly released from a women’s prison who enlists the help of the tax lawyer who is sent to drive her to a bus station. The lawyer (Griffin Dunne) is engaged to be married and is taken on an adventure that causes Finn and Trott to bond and become close, much to Trott’s annoyance and reluctance. Madonna cannot act, but she is a great fit for the role of Finn. Her makeup is fitting and the way that she evidently got so deep into the film’s role is deserving of praise. Other than that, the film has a predictable outlook as it progresses. I enjoyed meeting Finn’s old associates Raul (Coati Mundi) and Benny (Dennis Burkley) as well as the cougar Murray. The film has humorous moments but the predictability causes the film to lose any chance of being realistic. However, a song in the film, “Causing a Comotion”, sums up the character of Finn and her shenanigans throughout the picture.\n\nMoonstruck (1987)\n\nCher plays Loretta Castorini, a New York City bookeeper, who has been looking for love all of her life. Castorini decides that love is taking too long to come and she agrees to marry the best friend of her late husband. There is only one problem: She does not feel love towards the man, Johnny Cammareri (Danny Aiello). She is tasked by her fiancée to persuade his brother, Ronnie (Nicholas Cage) to come to their impending nuptials. From here, you can say, the rest is history.\n\nMoonstruck has an admirable storyline. It is one with heart. However, once Loretta’s fiancé gives her the duty of persuasion, predictability takes over and any viewer knows where it goes from here. The movie loses its edge over the others. I love Cher in this role but, with predictability, her acting chops go out the window. It is a cute film, but does not set itself apart from generic categorization.\n\nFunny Farm (1988)\n\nThis film gives you the realization that nothing is ever as it seems. Andy and Elizabeth (Chevy Chase and Madilyn Smith Osbourne) are young and married. They grow tiresome of city life and move to the country with Andy’s prospect to be the next great writer with his Great American Novel. As I said earlier, nothing is ever as it seems. The townspeople reveal their quirkiness and the movers get lost while delivering the couple’s furniture.\n\nIt is all a ruckus. Elizabeth begins to write herself and Andy is feeling threatened. The dreams they had of this picturesque town and their fantasy life are dashed. Dare I say ruined? It is a dark comedy with brilliant writing. The chemistry of Chase and Osbourne shine through, which makes the film all the more enjoyable. This is, indeed, a funny town, funny farm, and funny film.\n\nThe Accidental Tourist (1988)\n\nHere is a film that offers a glimpse inside the devastation that tragic heartbreak can cause if you have never experienced losing a child. With that heartbreak can come release.\n\nMacon Leary (William Hurt) is a travel guide writer who seems to lead a bleak life. Sarah Leary (Kathleen Turner) grows tired of how cold and shallow Macon has been. She wants a divorce. While trying to find a boarder for his dog at a local vet, Muriel Pritchett (Geena Davis) strikes up a friendly conversation with him. This continues in their next initial interactions. She calls him to offer animal advice and is persistent the more he is distant.\n\nPritchett unlocks the key to Leary’s hurt and William Hurt s marvelous as the pain is clear within Leary.\n\nPritchett introduces him to her child, for which his grief is too much and he is not ready, but the two get to know each other and bond.\n\nLater, his soon-to-be ex-wife wishes to rekinkle their romance. Leary is unsure but goes along with it anyhow, much to the sadness of Pritchett.\n\nLeary travels to Paris and Muriel ends up following him. Sarah surprises him and the atmosphere of France is the backdrop to Leary’s soul searching.\n\nThe Accidental Tourist is a diamond in the ruff. It has predictable moments but not many. The darkness of this feature is accompanied by sweetness, much like life and its pros and cons.\n\nThe chemistry that Hurt and Davis have with one another is charming, which is one of a variety of reasons as to why The Accidental Tourist should never be missed.\n\nLambada (1990)\n\nThis film centers around Kevin Laird (J. Eddie Peck), a teacher at Galaxy High, a school in the heat wave of Beverly Hills. Laird is a passionate teacher during school hours but a skilled dancer against the blanket of darkness encompassing the night sky outside No Man’s Land, a nightclub known for playing host to a barrage of fresh blood dancers who partake in the lambada.\n\nThe lambada is a dance that engulfs the layers of intimate connection that two dancers have with the body and enticing undercurrents of sex are displayed feverishly in the form of dance.\n\nProfessor Laird uses the tool of dance to gain credence and respect with his students as he teaches them in a study hall.\n\nLaird becomes so well engrossed in dance that he earns the nickname “Blade” within the dance crowd of the No Man’s Land.\n\nAs Professor Laird is accepted by his students, he begins to teach them math using everyday items such as pool balls to demonstrate the rectangular quadrant system in the hall used for his teaching sessions.\n\nWith each passing day in Galaxy High, Professor Laird’s students’ thirst for learning is realized the more he engages them through the challenge of connection and igniting the knowledge via intriguing ways that serve to make them happier and better people through the impact of his presence.\n\nSandy Thomas (Melora Hardin) , a student, sees Laird at No Man’s Land and fantasizes about him in the classroom. She proves herself persistent but her advances are continually rebuked given the fact that she is a minor.\n\nSandy reveals herself to be jealous and has a hand in orchestrating a gang war after Laird attempts to prepare his students for the GED test. The gang war unravels Laird’so perceived mysterious dancing life and culminates in his firing by Principal Singleton (Keene Curtis).\n\nThe aftermath of being terminated propels an uproar by Galaxy High students, including a rectified Sandy, as well as No Man’s Land workers and regulars, all of whom unite to give Superintendent Leland a bird’s eye view of the impact of Laird’s personality and effectiveness of his lessons.\n\nA final contest between the gang behind the venge-fueled war that caused Laird’s demise and his inspired students proves the aforementioned effectiveness mentioned above, just how much Laird has encouraged his class in their commitment to knowledge, and the importance of education, as cemented in Laird’s own background and the resulting potential he sees in all of his students. Professor Kevin Laird is an exemplary teacher that we all should wish to encounter.\n\n“Lambada” is an entertaining film with sometimes sub-par dialogue and skills in acting but the beating heart within the veins of this film is the energetic and passion-fueled dancing sure to keep you entranced and a storyline that shows hope and heart deemed inspiring and empowering for all to see, through the students of Galaxy High, the greatness within themselves.\n\nTrue Colors (1991)\n\nTrue Colors is virtually a self-portrait of politics and the nature of betrayal in the political arena.\n\nJohn Cusack and James Spader portray Peter Burton and Tim Gerrity, who have been best friends since high school. Burton is running for congress and Burton works for a law firm. Their friendship experiences the ltimate test when Gerrity sets Burton up when he catches him in a lie.\n\nPolitics is a dirty game and this film is a poignant testament to the kick dirt in your face attitude of Washington. Predictability runs rampant but True Colors is an important piece to see if you want to go into politics or are studying law. Most importantly, True Colors teaches the lesson that lies are ever present but never have any worth in life’s grand scheme. Everything has a price.\n\nLa vieille qui marchait dans la mer (The Old Lady Who Walked in the Sea) (1991)\n\nLady M (Jeanne Moreau) leads a fraudulant lifestyle. She has immense pain. The surrounding beauty that is the sea is a temporary bandage. Pompilius (Michael Srrault) helps in her scheme. She falls for a young man named Lambert (Luc Thuillier). Lambert is scheming in equal proportions. He uses Lady M. for monetary gain and Pomeilius has no use for the lad. It is a fascinating love triangle with astounding scenery as the backdrop for its mayhem. Moreau is brilliant. She makes the film.\n\nThe Prince of Tides (1991)\n\nNick Nolte is Tom Wingo. Wingo’s sister Sally (Blythe Danner) has experienced so much trauma that she is unable to recall fully what has happened as she has blocked a lot out by force. Tom fills in her childhood gaps for her psychologist, Susan Lowenstein (Barbara Streisand). The puzzle pieces of a traumatic and abusive childhood for both start to come together and one begins to realize the hatred Tom has for their mother.\n\nThrough the sessions, Lowenstein falls for Tom and the two begin their relationship on a whole new level.\n\nThe profession seeps through as Tom finds resolution and hope is found for Sally,\n\nThe film has an ending that I nether suspected nor liked seeing.\n\nStreisand has been a natural for decades. Her prowess as an actress and director is remarkable. The way that she encapsulates both New York and South Carolina and their accompanying beauty is a testament to her directorial efforts.\n\nThis is a film of pain, comfort in beings, triumph, and love overall. It is based on the book of the same name.\n\nUniversal Soldier (1992)\n\nPhysicality is evident here. Terrorists are in for a surprise with the creation of an elite group of soldiers is used to overpower the enemy.\n\nAly Walker portrays reporter Veronica Roberts, who travels with this group and witnesses the essential secret for their success. The soldiers are, basically super soldiers who have abilities that normal humans are not lucky enough to embody. One of the reporter’s cameramen is killed by a super soldier. Luc (Jean-Claude Van Damme) begins to have flashbacks and changes his war-set mind and becomes very helpful to her.\n\nUniversal Soldier is very unique but hard to follow at times. With new technologies even now, 23 years after this film, I imagine universal soldiers are possible. This film gives the notion that robotic soldiers would be taken over by emotion. That is nice to fathom but, probably, unrealistic. This is a movie after all. Van Damme is a star but has since been type-cast in roles like this. He has a lot of talent. Universal Soldier is unique, puzzling, and universal to its core audience.\n\nConsenting Adults (1992)\n\nRichard Parker (Kevin Kline) is a musical composer. He and his wife Priscilla (Mary Elizabeth Mastrantonio) lead ordinary lives.\n\nWhen new neighbors Eddy and Kay Otis (Kevin Spacey and Rebecca Miller) move in next door, the couples become fast friends. Eddy is an expert at scamming insurance companies. Being that the two men are attracted to their respective wives, the men make a deal to sleep with the other’s wife for a night.\n\nThings take a turn for the absolute worst when Kay turns up dead the next morning. Eddy has established an alibi and Richard ends up arrested and must hire a private investigator to help him.\n\nIt is here that we learn a twist within the film and Eddy’s true colors may be revealed. Richard is implicated in a second murder, which causes him to do all he can to outsmart Eddy before it is too late.\n\nThis film is full of suspense. Like a lot of these, it has its predictable moments but it is not the usual turnoff that it has been in others. Consenting Adults will keep you guessing, for the most part, until its conclusion.\n\nMa petite entreprise (My Little Business) (1999)\n\nIvan Lansi stars as a small business owner trying to make his business work. He discovers that his insurer (Francios Berleand)has embezzled money and he, in fact, does not have any insurance. He hatches a plan that plays out throughout the feature that reinforces the belief that it is of massive importance to have good people surrounding you.\n\nThe scenry of France is absolutely gorgeous. I have found that scenery particularly sticks out in French cinema. Berleand is exceptional as a conning insurance man and Lansi dives into the role of the small business man giving all he’s got head first. This is a gem of a film.\n\nPas De Scandale (Keep It Quiet) (No Scandal) (1999)\n\nGregoire (Fabrice Luchini) is a formerly successful businessman. He was jailed for fraudulant crimes with his finances and, upon release, he goes back to his apartment with his wife Agnes (Isabelle Huppert) and their kids.\n\nThe family notices a mood change in Gregorie since he gained his freedom back. Gregorie agrees to a television interview with his talk show host brother Louis Jeancourt (Vincent Lindon).\n\nDuring the interview, Gregorie stiffens up and feels trapped. While getting his hair done at a parlor, he encounters a woman who has a boyfriend who had been an inmate at the very prison where Gregorie did his time and the two where, incidentally, released on the same day.\n\nYou can pretty much guess what happens from there. The cinematography is witty as the film opens with Gregorie traveling by car the day of his release. The sky is gloomy and rainy, reflecting Gregorie’s mood.\n\nAside from the cinematographic wit, the film itself is very slow in pace and drags on from time to time. The film mirrors Gregorie’s new slow and easy approach with his life now. The story had promise but was drenched in ruin by the predictability of it all about half way through.\n\nI wish it were easy to like this film. The only thing good about this feature is Vahina Giocante as Stephanie the hair stylist.\n\nShe was a rising star in this film which is clear by her abilities at such a young age. Although this film has a murky flow and the pace of molasses, Giocante will go far.\n\nÇa commence aujourd’hui (It All Starts Today) (1999)\n\nPhilippe Torreton stars as Daniel, a kindergarten teacher in France. The film documents the very real struggle of parents who feel the effects of unemployment while trying to raise their children. Daniel is seen trying to unite fellow staff members of the school to keep education afloat amid the chaotic nature of a community in time of need while also juggling the strained relationships he has with his family.\n\nThis is likely the most relatable film of my Jurgen Vollmer Film Festival. I write this in a time where teachers and parents deal with this very struggle every day. Parents do the best they can working to feed and provide for their children and teachers fight in unions for proper pay and substantial budgets, like Daniel does also, and pay for school items out of pocket.\n\nThis is a film of the times that remain as relevant today as it was in 1999. Torreton evokes powerful emotion and passion for what he is doing under the mindful eye of director Bertrand Tavernier. Tavernier is excellent at his craft and, with this film, establishes himself once again as one of the greats of French cinema.\n\nFrom Hell (2001)\n\nInspector Frederick Abberline is a detective determined to bring Jack the Ripper to justice. This film chronicles the murders of Jack the Ripper in 1880s London. Abberline has wild theories about the murders de to the visions that he has and these theories lead him to conclude that Jack the Ripper is educated based on the way each murder is done with precision.\n\nAbberline falls in love with a prostitute named Mary Kelly (Heather Graham). The brutal nature of the murders takes its tragic turn and affects everybody.\n\nI have to say that Depp is great in the role of Abberline. You feel sympathetic towards him and his struggle to lead a normal life as the murders increase.\n\nFrom Hell is, I think, a lesser-known film in Depp’s repertoire. It deserves recognition.\n\nBehind Enemy Lines (2001)\n\nThe film is intense from start to finish as Navy navigator Chris Burnett (Owen Wilson) is struck down by the enemy during war.\n\nInspired by the Mrkonjic Grad Incident during the Bosnia War, after being struck down, the opposing side as well as a secret police enforcer are on his tail in hot pursuit to capture him.\n\nHis commanding officer, Rear Admiral Leslie McMahon Reigart (Gene Hackman) does everything he can to turn over every stone and rescue him.\n\nThe plot is carried out too aggressively for my taste but there definitely is an audience for this film. In my view, the action scenes use too much force but it is acceptable as the Bosnian War encountered such forceful tactics.\n\nGene Hackman gives an astounding performance that will leave viewers remembering his dedication to Wilson’s Burnett for years to come. No man is left behind.\n\nThe League of Extraordinary Gentlemen (2003)\n\nIn a nutshell, a variety of popular fantasy characters such as Tom Sawyer (Shane West), Dorian Gray (Stuart Townsend), Dr. Henry Jekyll and Edward Hyde (Jason Flemyng), M (Richard Roxburgh), Captain Nemo (Naseeruddin Shah), and Alan Quatermain (Sean Connery) join forces for a top secret mission for the British Empire.\n\nPhotography captures the mood and essence of 19th century life in the U.K. with vigor. That said, the film is too long for its own good. Additionally, it is a waste of the talents of Connery and Company. I imagine that they did this movie for the money.\n\nThere can be too much going on with too many characters at times and the Average Joe will be looking at their watch. The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen is based on one of six comic books. Comics generally have a niche, core crowd. There is a lot of action to attract those people, but for me the other movie goers are left in the dark and I dispise a film that makes no effort to pull in new, unfamiliar audiences.\n\nThe Order (2003)\n\nThe Carolingians are a historic group of priests and the head of the Carolingians is found dead.\n\nAlex Bernier (Heath Ledger) must go to Rome to get a handle on the case and find out the man’s exact cause of his death.\n\nBernier has help from Father Thomas (Mark Addy) and a beautiful troubled artist named Mara BSincair (Shannyn Sossamon). All roads point to mystery and bizarre circumstances.\n\nThe Order is an excellent thriller-mystery with a spectacular performance by Benno Furmann. Ledger should be known for this film.\n\nRome is used beautifully as the film’s setting. No other ppace would fit a film with secret commentary, perhaps, about Catholicism. Director Brian Helgeland benefits by using every actor’s strengths to get the best out of them and the essence and beauty of Sossamon shines beautifully in her scenes.\n\nThis is an underrated film.\n\nMan on Fire (2004)\n\nCIA officer and former United States Marine Force Reconnocance officer John Creasy (Denzel Washington) is in ned of work. Hanks to networking with old pal Paul Rayburn (Christopher Walken) he becomes a bodyguard.\n\nProminent businessman Samuel Ramos (Marc Anthony) hires Creasy to protect his 9-year-old.\n\nCreasy has demons that he works to conquer from his experiences in the Marines and CIA. Pita, the daughter, (Dakota Fanning), becomes close to Creasy and the two form a bond.\n\nPita is abducted and Creasy is shot several times. He is suspected to be a hit target by Miguel Manzano (Giancarlo Gianni), an agent for the AFI.\n\n“La Voz” (Roberto Sosa) is the mastermind demanding a ransom. The ransom is delvered but taken by a corrupt group of officers and not delivered to “La Voz.”\n\nCorruption runs amuck and Creasy vows vengeance against the kidnappers. The power of journalism is demonstrated with swift effectivity as well.\n\nWashington gives a wonderful performance as Creasy and the film appeals to its target audience with action that will keep you gripped for the entire duration.\n\nYou will never see the ending coming. I stil have mixed feelings about its close, but the film satisfies and holds nothing back.\n\nAVP: Alien vs. Predator (2004)\n\nDuring an archaeological expedition on Bouvetøya Island in Antarctica, archeologists are flabbergasted when they discover that they are smackdab in the middle of a life or death war between Alien and Predator, each from their own respective franchises.\n\nMuch like Freddy vs. Jason, AVP is moronically stupid. Granted, fans of each franchise wil love it. And they did, for there is a sequel. I found this incredibly disappointing, but what can you expect? I enjoyed the story of the archeologists and how the group found themselves involved in the fierce battle, but the battle sequences are mediocre and will leave you unfulfilled of the battle you wish could be improved.\n\nThe dark and eerie scenery sets the mood for the battle, but the sequences are not worthy of praise.\n\nI am not the audience for this, but I think even fans of the two would be left scratching their heads wondering, “Why, why, why!”\n\nMr. & Mrs. Smith (2005)\n\nBrad Pitt and Angelina Jolie star as John and Jean Smith, a married couple married for “5 or 6 years” who are having marital problems. The two are spies working for separate organizations. They are tasked with the assignment to kill one another, which launches them on a wild adventure as they try to outsmart the other and, perhaps, rekindle their old flame.\n\nVince Vaughn has a memorable performance as Eddie. He brings the comic relief in an otherwise action-filled picture.\n\nAt the time this film was made, Pitt and Jolie had fallen in love while filming. Audiences can most certainly feel the chemistry and energy between them. This film fits the duo like a glove. It is clear the two had a great time making it and it is a wonderful piece of film to add to your action-packed collection.\n\nMy Ray of Sunshine for today is:\n\nThe cinema in any language is amazing. While what is presented on film is not a complete representation of cultures, the cinema can introduce us to many cultures and ways of thinking. The cinema is a gateway to other countries and parts of the world. If one cannot afford to travel, put on a movie from any country you wish to see and you will be enamored with the sites of your dreams. Movies take you on a journey.\n\nThe cinema can introduce us to many actors and directors we may have not known before but whom, now, are amongst our favorites. The world is a melting pot of many cultures and languages. Watch films and you will see how amazing that is.\n\nThe scenery is beautiful, which is thanks, in this series, partly to photographer Jürgen Vollmer. His talent is everlasting and with these films, his and the actors’ and directors’ works are preserved.\n\nIf you want to check out more of Jurgen Vollmer’s photography work, look for his book From Hamburg To Hollywood, which contains his photographs from his outstanding career as a photographer for bands such as The Beatles as well as set photographer for these films. He also is brilliant at telling his personal stories, which accompany nearly every photo.\n\nHe has also authored Jürgen Vollmer: On Filmsets and Other Locations, The Beatles in Hamburg: Photographs 1961 as well as Rock ‘N’ Roll Times: The Style and Spirit of the Early Beatles and Their First Fans.\n\nFurthermore, he took the album cover of John Lennon’s Rock ‘n’ Roll album, which is a picture of Lennon in his pre-mop top period with the Fabs.\n\nThe only films that Jurgen Vollmer was set photographer for that I was not able to find were Tout Peut Arriver (Don’t Be Blue) (1969), and the television documentary, Lillian Gish (1983).\n\nIf anybody finds these films, let me know where I can see them in their entirety and I will add them to this, my Jurgen Vollmer Film Festival.\n\nFUN FACT : There is a HandMade Films connection to one of the films that Vollmer was involved with.\n\nImmediatley after shooting Shanghai Surprise, which George Harrison helped finance with HandMade Films, Madonna undertook the role of Nikki Finn in Who’s That Girl?\n\nTo read my film reviews of every film produced by George Harrison’s production company HandMade Films, check out what I call my HandMade Films Film Festival at\n\nhttps://bobsrayofsunshine.wordpress.com/2015/01/16/the-handmade-films-film-festival/\n\nIn 1978, George Harrison founded the British film production company HandMade Films with his then-manager Denis O’Brien to finance Monty Python’s Life of Brian. I am a huge Beatles fanatic. It should come as no one’s Shanghai Surprise, then, that from October 2014-January 2015, I held what I have dubbed a HandMade Films Film Festival. Here, now, I’ll be reviewing each of HandMade Films’ 28 films as quickly and as detailed as I can.\n\nLittle Malcom (1974) (NOT A HANDMADE FILM)\n\nLittle Malcolm is the inaugural film produced by George Harrison pre-Handmade.\n\nThe film, based on the David Halliwell play of the same name and produced under the watchful eye of Apple Films, centers around Malcolm Scrawdyke’s plan for revenge against the unseen Alott once he is kicked out of college. His friends Wick, Dennis, and Irvin concoct a plan to meet with him on weekends. Malcolm has a better idea when he devises the concept of the Party of Dynamic Erection. The party mirrors the perceived magnanimity yet dangerous ideals of the Nazi party, which served as the basis for the Party of Dynamic Erection in Halliwell’s mind when writing the play.\n\nScraedyke, (John Hurt, in a mesmerizing performance) is assisted in concocting a plan to kidnap Allott as the true means, purpose, and driving force behind the party. In fact, Skrawdyke hopes his creation to be the antithesis of authority’s permeated societal conformity.\n\nScrawdyke and his crew set out to act out the proposed kidnapping of Allott, which see Skrawdyke and crew using the draw of a rare painting that they take in a heist from an art gallery as the launch for their operation, hoping to convince Allott to destroy the painting in desperation.\n\nSeeing Wick, (John McEnery) Irwin, (Raymond Platt) and Dennis (David Warner) act out the kidnapping was an immense delight that is full of hilarity that proves to be the film’s highlight.\n\nThe entirety of the cast serve up riveting portrayals of their characters, each given time to shine through individual monologues the more Scrawdyke’s self-serving, dualistic personality bubbles to the surface on the screen resulting from his ever-present paranoia. His true colors are not pretty.\n\nRosalind Ayres is remarkable as Ann Gedge, Scrawdyke’s love interest that never was due to his lack of confidence. It is Gedge who csuses Scrawdyke’s kidnapping plot to foil in a gut-wrenching scene that is hard to watch. Gedge unwittingly unleashes the full-blown darkness that a fear of being “found out” can unmask beneath what has always defined and limited Malcolm Scrawdyke. Cowardice.\n\nLittle Malcolm (1974) is a film full of surprises that you will not see coming. It is a shame it has gone unnoticed by so many. Seek it out immediately. The performances and plot are commendable throughout the picture and the music supplied by Harrison and Apple Corps. bands Splinter and Harpoon are all additional gifts awaiting your unwrapping ala Christmas morning.\n\nHANDMADE FILMS PRIDUCTIONS\n\nMonty Python’s Life of Brian (1979)- A man named Brian was born next door to Jesus, joins an Anti-Roman separatist group, but is often mistaken for the Messiah. This is a religious satire that does a fantastic job at pointing out and making fun of the hypocrisy of humans and the emphasis we put on religion. It has funny elements, but I don’t really care for the film. It’s not complete garbage as some scenes are funny but, for me, not many.\n\nA Sense of Freedom (1979)- This film tells the story of Jimmy Boyle’s prison stay. It was based on Boyle’s 1977 book of the same name. David Hayman is a natural in the role of Boyle. I really enjoyed this film. It shows the struggles of getting used to prison, what it is like inside, and the struggles upon release. A very good film that is a gem to see.\n\nThe Long Good Friday (1980)- I fell in love with Bob Hoskins here. He plays Harold Shand, an old-school former gangster with the high hopes of turning his life around by becoming a successful businessman free from his past. The only problem is that he needs the financial backing of the Mafia. Hoskins does an outstanding job in the role. It is without question a 1970s period piece, which adds something to the picture. I love Helen Mirren, too. I can’t rave enough about this film. HandMade Films may very well have made my all-time favorite crime film.\n\nTime Bandits (1981)- Time Bandits definitely unleashes the inner-child in all of us. The film is a masterpiece in every sense. The cinema can showcase the unlocking of the imagination and it certainly does through 11-year-old Kevin. Kevin is a history fanatic who has a wonderful and always-flowing imagination. He is visited by a knight who takes him, night after night, to historical events and fairy tales to witness them firsthand. Time Bandits definitely is a work of art and one of my HandMade favorites.\n\nTattoo (1981)- Bruce Dern plays a tattoo artist hired by a modeling agency. He becomes infatuated and far too obsessed with one model in particular. He holds her hostage and uses her body to tattoo his ultimate crème de la crème of tattoos. Dern should never have done this horrible, horrible picture. I don’t know if he needed the money or if he wanted to meet a former Beatle, but neither George nor Dern should have wasted their time on this trash. No wonder it got a Razzie.\n\nVenom (1981)-An internationally-known criminal uses rich lady Ruth Hopkins’ (Cornelia Sharpe) driver and house lady in a plot to kidnap her son. However, her son brings home a poisonous snake that was wrongly switched and destined for a toxicology lab. The snake unleashes terror and murder on the house. It’s safe to say from my synopsis that this film is nothing but trash. The actors probably needed the work, but this is not worth anybody’s time or money to buy or rent. Let this not unveil its venom inside your bloodstream—or movie screen that is.\n\nThe Burning (1982)- A group of kids at a summer camp pull a prank gone wrong on a camp employee that they all make fun of. The kids put a skull with candle eye sockets in the guy’s bed. The counselor wakes up and is startled by the skeleton skull. This causes the lit candles to ignite everything in his room on fire, including the man himself. He is burned. Every summer, the counselor returns to the camp to enact revenge on kids for what happened to him. There is most definitely a 80s vibe to this film and you can easily tell that it was made for the sole purpose of capitalizing on the popularity of slasher films of its day. All copies of “The Burning” should be burned never to be seen again. It is a good time waster if you’re not expecting anything else. Perhaps it’s good for a Halloween gathering. Funnily enough, it was around Halloween when I watched it. Still, it did nothing for me but show the cruelty and judgments of hospital employees (some) and dirty, rotten teens.\n\nMonty Python Live at the Hollywood Bowl (1982) This film was simply John Cleese, Eric Idle, and the Python crew singing songs and dong sketches while—you guessed it—live at the Hollywood Bowl. The crew took a page from The Beatles ala 1965 and performed to a sold-out crowd. Not surprising. Also, there are intersecting clips of sketches, too. Nothing against the Pythons, but they’re just not funny to me. I was not closed-minded. I had not watched or seen anything Python prior to this, excluding Life of Brian, which, I said, was not all bad. I liked the Monty Python songs more than the sketches. Everything else, for me, was not up to par. Although I will say that The Rutles was a genius idea and film. Much love to the Python pals, but not their concert movie.\n\nScrubbers (1982)- This film was very controversial in its day probably because of the two lesbian characters. Two girls escape from a London girls’ prison brothel. One, Annetta, (Crissie Catterill) has a goal of seeing her child, who is a toddler in an advent being raised by nuns. The other, Carol, (Amanda York), is hoping to see the inside of a more nearer prison because she wants to be in the clink with her girlfriend. The film is hard to watch and gets very depressing. Both girls end up in the same prison and the girlfriend that Carol hoped to see has a replacement. As a result, the girlfriend and her new lover tease and taunt Carol. Annetta seeks revenge upon her arrival to the prison and Carol is forced to find protection. Both Amanda York and Chrissie Cotterill give worthy performances, but the film is dark and I thought it was far too depressing to be entertaining.\n\nThe Missionary (1982)- Michael Palin gives a noteworthy performance as Rev. Charles Fortesque, who is offered a job to minister and look after prostitutes in the East End after returning from a decade-long missionary trip in Africa. Lady Ames (Maggie Smith) handles the cash for the assignment, but lonely Ames has the Reverend share her bed. I’d say Rev. Fortesque has an exciting time when he engages in a lot of “adventures”, shall we say, with the women of the East End. He doesn’t need a red light district, to say the least. It is a surprisingly good film. I enjoyed it a lot. I enjoy the acting of both Palin and Smith in their respective roles. It is worth the watch for plot and entertainment.\n\nPrivates on Parade (1982)- This is based on a play by Peter Nichols, for those that don’t know, and it centers on a primarily gay military group providing entertainment. They are called the “Song and Dance Unit, Southeast Asia.” Their task: To entertain the troops during the Malayan Emergency. It is hilarious to see John Cleese’s Major Giles Flack and his whole brigade in drag and singing. For those parts alone, it is worth it.\n\nA Private Function (1984) – The year is 1947. Princess Elizabeth and Prince Phillip are getting married. England had as a food shortage problem to consider, but local businessmen desire to celebrate this Royal Wedding. The pig that they wish to raise and roast gets pig-napped by Gilbert Chilvers, (played by Michael Palin), and Joyce, (Maggie Smith) doesn’t help matters. Events take place and a food inspector attempts to end the food shortage. Palin and Smith are the perfect pair for a British comedy. I love Richard Griffiths in the role of accountant Henry Allardyce. It is a good film that shows the lengths people go to for a celebration. It is not the best in the HandMade Films archives but it is funny and entertaining enough to give a passing grade.\n\nWater (1985)- Michael Caine’s Baxter Thwaites is the Governor Cascara, a colony in the Caribbean in need of tourism. Luck changes for the entire colony all thanks to explorers who discover mineral water that has chemical effects and completely reinvigorates the colony’s economy. This film does drag a bit but Caine is great as Baxter. The cast were good and Caine offers lots of laughs. While it is lesser-known, I enjoyed watching this. Additionally, it was great seeing George, Ringo, and Eric Clapton among others, comprise the Singing Rebel’s Band\n\nMona Lisa (1986)- Bob Hoskins plays George, an ex-convict turned chauffer. He is hired fresh from prison to drive Simone, (played brilliantly by Cathy Tyson). A friendship forms between the two the more George drives her. George is thrust into the danger of Simone’s lifestyle. It certainly is a double-edged sword. George helps Simone track down her long lost friend while trying to dig some dirt on a regular of Simone’s for his boss. Hoskins was a true treasure and his acting was spot on here. Tyson gave a great performance as Simone as well. We are reminded of the cruelty of life by the end. I loved the scenery in the exterior scenes. Director Neil Jordan is amazing and Hoskins should have won the Oscar he was nominated for. A ‘80s classic.\n\nShanghai Surprise (1986)- Gloria Tatlock (Madonna) is looking to get some opium for her ill parents. Glendon Wasey (Sean Penn) is looking for the fastest way possible out of China. The two wind up on the hunt for drugs and fall for one another. Smugglers will stop at nothing to get the drugs they possess. I quite liked the plot of Shanghai Surprise. Unfortunately, it was a surprise to see that the acting was atrocious and kills any chance the film had for success.\n\nWithnail and I (1987)- Withnail and Marwood, (Richard E. Grant and Paul McGann) are two friends and Londoners anxious for success. They are eager for a trip and get a key to Withnail’s uncle’s cottage. Withnail’s Uncle Monty, (Richard Griffiths) is gay and immediately takes a liking to Marwood. After excuses are made, Withnail and Marwood go back to their lives, but Marwood grows tired of Withnail’s immaturity. The ending is not what I expected and rather tragic, but there are elements of comedy and tragedy here. All three actors are fantastic and I now know why this film has such a cult following. I loved it, too.\n\nBellman and True (1987)- Bernard Hill plays a computer expert who is forced by bank robbers to decode the bank alarm system to the bank where he once worked after the robbers track he and his son to London after Hiller (Hill) originally gave them the code. The robbers kidnap his son and force Hiller to engage in the robbery. I liked the intensity of the film. The acting was good. The plot is rather slow at first but it picks up and is worth watching. My only complaint is that the British accents can be hard to understand at times when characters talk fast.\n\nThe Lonely Passion of Judith Hearne (1987)- Based on the 1955 book by Brian Moore, Maggie Smith plays Judith Hearne, a lonely piano teacher in 1950s Ireland. Hearne falls for James Madden, (Bob Hoskins), a businessman who once lived in New York and desires to launch his own American burger eatery. Madden’s family think that Hearne is after Madden not for love but, more so, money. So begins the downfall. Hearne becomes a woman dependent on alcohol and desperate for companionship. The film does a great job at emphasizing the near coke hold that the Catholic religion places on people and, in this case, the entire country of Ireland. Moore’s frustration with the church inspired him to write the book in the first place. Madden’s true intentions are revealed and the film ends where it deserves to. I empathize with Hearne.Everybody deserves happiness with the right person. I love Bob Hoskins and Maggie Smith. They really do wonders bringing their characters to life. I recommend it.\n\nTrack 29 (1988)- A mother gives up her son for adoption as an infant but never forgets him. Years later, Martin, (played by Gary Oldman), goes searching for his mother. He runs into her at a restaurant and, days later, comes to her house. Martin begins to tell his story and live with his mother and her toy train-obsessed husband. Martin begins backtracking and living the childhood that he never could. Little do we know, his mother may be imagining her son the whole time. Martin resents his mother’s husband for neglecting his mom. Things take an unexpected turn. Gary Oldman is fantastic as Martin and Theresa Russell is marvelous as his mom, Linda. It is a little-known prize in the vaults of Handmade Films.\n\nFive Corners (1988)- This crime drama is set in the Bronx in the 1960s and stars Jodie Foster as Linda. Foster is superb. Heinz, the neighborhood tormentor, has just been released from prison. Linda had nearly been raped by Heinz, sending him to prison. Harry, (played by Tim Robbins), is a peace-loving guy who is Linda’s protector. Due to the violent events happening in the 1960s, Harry believes in nonviolence and Heinz is back to his old ways. Throughout the film, different things happen to supporting characters on different sections of New York—hence the title. The film shows how lowlife jackasses can take advantage of girls without them even realizing it due to substances. Get my drift? Heinz causes ruckus and the police follow in his trail. This movie is a gritty nailbiter that will keep you on the edge of your seat throughout. It is phenomenal.\n\nThe Raggedy Rawney (1988)- A soldier during World War II goes a wall after being traumatized by witnessing his friend’s death and blinding an officer. The shell shock causes Tom, the soldier, (played by Dexter Fletcher), to not talk. He becomes acquainted with a caravan of gypsies led by Darcy, (Bob Hoskins). The Army that Tom was once a part of tries to find him and threatens the gypsies. Tom, dressed as a woman from an encounter with a little girl, falls for Darcy’s daughter Jessie, (Zoe Nathenson), and the incoming army forces the gypsies to fight. This is a great film filled with heart. Bob Hoskins sat in the director’s chair for this. He did a great job. The scenery is gorgeous, too. I recommend this to all.\n\nChecking Out (1988)- Jeff Daniels stars as Ray Macklin. Macklin becomes an obsessive hypochondriac when a work friend collapses and dies. He overreacts to every ache, pain, and the like and will not be convinced that he is healthy. He has a conversation with his deceased friend while unconscious in the hospital after a car crash. This was hilarious. I can relate to Daniels’ Macklin as I, too, am a hypochondriac. This movie does a great job at emphasizing the ridiculousness of hypochondria. This is funny and I recommend it.\n\nHow to Get Ahead in Advertising (1989)- Richard E. Grant plays an advertising executive named Dennis Dimbleby who has a nervous breakdown in his position as executive taking advantage of consumers. The breakdown causes a big boil to grow on his face, which only he can hear taunting and talking to him. The boil adds to his stress and makes him into a miserable person. The film is funny, a bit bizarre, but sad as well. It does a great job at pointing out how advertisers take advanta0ge of consumers. It did not have the ending I would have liked, but I suppose it is a true one if this were to actually occur.\n\nPowwow Highway (1989)- Greedy road developers stand in the way of A Martinez’s Buddy Red Bow. Gary Farmer’s Philbert Bono sees visions and seeks medicine for the spirits. His 1964 Buick Wildcat is given to him for a trade of drugs and liquor. Amanda Wyss plays Bonnie, Buddy’s sister is arrested in New Mexico. Buddy and Philbert embark on a road trip to break his sister out of jail. This film is great and far too lesser-known. It shows the importance of family that the Lame Deer, Montana Cheyenne tribe places in their culture. It is important for all of us to remember. For that reason alone, it is worth checking out.\n\nCold Dog Soup (1989)- Frank Whaley plays Michael Latchmer, who asks Sarah Hughes, (Christine Harnos) on a date. While on the date at her mother’s home, Sarah’s old dog collapses and dies. Mother and daughter ask Michael to bury the dog in the park. While in a taxi, the driver Jack, (Randy Quaid), persuades Michael to sell the dead dog’s corpse for other means. One of the many means is for cold dog soup in a restaurant. Sarah becomes involved in the task gone wrong and is taken aback by Jack, leaving Michael in the dirt. Randy Quaid gives a tremendous performance but the film is predictable. It has worthy moments which are funny, but the predictability never stops.\n\nNuns on the Run (1990)- Robbie Coltrane and Eric Idle star as Brian Hope and Charlie McManus, two thieves who steal money in a robbery after after their boss and a drug dealer are killed. The duo go on the run after robbing a Triad gang and end up disguised as nuns named Sister Inviolata of the Immaculate Conception and Sister Euphemia of the Five Wounds. Faith, whom Brian began a relationship with, witnesses the two go into the nunnery. The Superior offers to help them, but she wants the money they have to go to the convent. The film is very eventful and will leave you laughing throughout. It will be a pleasure every time you put the DVD of this film on. I very much recommend it.\n\nThe Wrong Guy (1997)- George did not produce this film, as his lawsuit against Denis O’Brien was taking place at this time and he sold HandMade to Paragon Entertainment in ’94. However, I’ll review it nonetheless. Dave Foley’s Nelson works at a business and gets overlooked for a promotion. He shouts death threats to his boss soon after. A short time later, Nelson finds is boss in his office dead. This prompts him to go on the run, fearing the police. However, even when the police rule him out, he’s still running from the law. It is not until being picked up on the road by Lynne Holden, (Jennifer Tilly), shacking up with her, and meeting and being a hostage of his boss’s true killer, that Nelson realizes he is not the fugitive he thought. This is a pretty decent film. It gets predictable as the film goes on, but it draws laughs. It’s not horrible.\n\nThank you, George, for adding movie producer to your resume in the 1980s. For the most part, HandMade Films has a great repertoire. I love how HandMade gave creative freedom to the filmmakers of these films. I did not like them all, but it’s been great doing the first official HandMade Films Film Festival. A lot of the actors in HandMade Films went on to make names for themselves in the film industry. A lot of future Harry Potter stars owe their gratitude to HandMade. Maggie Smith, Timothy Spall, Richard Griffiths, Robbie Coltrane, and Gary Oldman all appeared in Potter. I respect and admire Harrison and O’Brien for trying their Hand at every film genre such comedy, drama, musical, and more. That alone sets HandMade apart from the rest.\n\nHas anybody else ever done a HandMade Films Film Festival? I hope I started a trend. I encourage you all to undertake this if you love film. You will discover British film gems. HandMade Films made some of the best films to grace cinema that you will ever see. Satisfaction guaranteed. Additionally, your opinions may differ from mine.\n\nFILMS INFLUENCED BY MONA LISA (1986) AND THE OUTPUT OF HANDMADE FILMS:\n\nPrompted by the release of the HandMade Films-produced neo-noir film Mona Lisa (1986), there had been a factory-like wave of films in the British neo-noir genre from the years 1987-2003 that were influenced by the filmmaking stylings and techniques of Mona Lisa (1986) as well as HandMade Films as a whole. Below are my reviews of those HandMade-inspired cinematic contributions. Without the impact of HandMade Films on British cinema, these films would not have been made. Thanks again, George.\n\nHidden City (1987):\n\nCassie Stuart plays Sharon Newton, who is a picture researcher who becomes fixated on a piece of government film that splices a hidden supposed kidnapping of a woman in the 1940s within the film and its ensuing follow-up films. Charles Dance wittingly plays charming journalist James Richards, who uses his connection with Britain’s Ministry of Defense to uncover, through Newton, government secrets that lead, ultimately, to piecing together the woman hidden within the Government films’ story. As Richards and Newton tirelessly work to put the pieces together, they are led to an underground tunnel, an incinerator, and the very building where the hidden woman’s story was filmed. The film is fascinating and demonstrates, in no uncertain terms, that the Government will stop at nothing to withhold secrets and no city will remain as you remember it. I am fond of the relationship between Dance and Stuart as the film progresses. Director Stephen Poliakoff’s directing is worth praise. This film remains a highlight of the films inspired by Mona Lisa (1986) and HandMade Films. I also see the influence of the thrill first seen within kidnap thriller Bellman & True (1987).\n\nStormy Monday (1988)\n\nSean Bean portrays Brendan, a Jazz club worker who meets waitress (Melanie Griffith) and the two begin a blossoming romance when he meets her at her restaurant of employment. The jazz club’s owner Finney (Sting), a former participant in Mob activities, tries to put his past behind him. After he is propositioned by blackmailing gangsters, Finney turns the tide just as a dinner encompassing American investors approaches. Cosmo (Tommy Lee Jones) is the most corrupt of them all and his motives are unveiled when it is learned that he uses Kate as a prostitute for gain for his business. Cosmo and Finney collide the more Cosmo puts pressure on Finney to sell his club so that Cosmo can move forward with other plans for the city.\n\nThis film is far less enticing. The scenes featuring Finney’s organized crime connections are not at all gripping to the viewer and, I feel, the investor dinner went on for far too long. Tommy Lee Jones does not convince me in his role as a ruthless investor. He most likely only did this picture for the money. The only thing about the film that shines throughout is the chemistry between Sean Bean and Melanie Griffith. That aside, Stormy Monday (1988) should have been engulfed in a tornado, never to survive the wreckage.\n\nShallow Grave (1994)\n\nDanny Boyle’s directorial debut, Shallow Grave (1994) revolves around three friends: Physician Juliet Miller (Kerry Fox), journalist Alex Law (Ewan McGregor), and accountant David Stephens (Christopher Eccleston) in need of a fourth roommate. The three go about interviewing potential mates, asking cruel questions to make themselves laugh at the expenses of the applicants’ reactions.\n\nHugo (Keith Allen) is eventually entrusted as the fourth roommate but is never seen again after unpacking his bag and shutting his given bedroom door.\n\nWhy is Hugo not seen again? The entourage of friends find him dead on his bed next to a suitcase full of money. Wanting to keep Hugo’s death a secret and keep the money they discover, the friends bury Hugo’s corpse in the woods after it is decided via drawing lots that David be the one to dismember his body parts.\n\nLittle do they know that Hugo is being chased down by a group of men who murder informants while on their way to tracking Hugo down. The police are thrown into the mix when the apartment below the one occupied by the trio is vandalized. This causes them all increasing anxiety and David becomes paranoid after some of the money is spent by Alex and Juliet.\n\nDavid begins living in the attic along with the suitcase of money and the once friendly relationship between the trio becomes strained as the violent men pursuing Hugo’s trail break into their apartment.\n\nDavid’s paranoia results in tragedy as he brings a dark Beatles song to life as the police close in on the friends upon the botched burial of the murderous men.\n\nDistrust is coated within the film and leads to a conclusion nobody will see coming. The bottom line through it all is that, in the end, we all should have friends but, if you can’t trust them, what then?\n\nShallow Grave (1994) is a ‘90s classic. The plot seems put together with thought-out care. The cinematography within the film mirrors the feel of the feature the more it goes forward. This is a standout of British cinema.\n\nI am glad that this film exists as it alone directly influenced British cinema for the next twenty odd years. Being influenced by Mona Lisa (1986) and the neo-noir introduced about ten years or more prior with HandMade Films’ filmography, one could say that George Harrison keeps giving and giving just through his cinematic contributions to the British film industry via HandMade Films.\n\nFollowing (1998)\n\nJeremy Theobald plays a young, struggling writer who follows strangers around London in secret as he looks for an idea for his debut novel. Cobb, a young man in a dark suit, notices he is being followed and confronts the wannabe writer.\n\nCobb (Alex Haw) is a serial burglar who encourages his follower to partake in the burglaries with him. Cobb’s goal in burglaring is to force his victims to reevaluate what they had and take better care of the things they cherish in their lives.\n\nAs the struggling writer pursues a relationship with a blonde woman (Lucy Russell) once burglarized by he and Cobb, the writer realizes that the blonde and Cobb had been seeing one another as well and had conceived a plan to manipulate him. A bald man had committed a murder in flat, which was discovered by Cobb and the flat was burgled by the writer. The blonde reveals her own blackmailing schemes. Yet again, it is proven that nobody is safe from being stabbed in the back. This is a quick-witted story with many layers. Director Christopher Nolan learned well from the film noir stylings of Mona Lisa (1986) and gave the world a gripping, engaging story with many layers. It is a worthy film to watch.\n\nCroupier (1998)\n\nClive Owen masterfully plays Jack Manfred, a struggling writer. His writing is not taking him anywhere or opening any doors. To make ends meet, he secretly takes a job at a casino as a croupier, a dealer, a job he once undertook while living in South Africa. As time goes on, the job takes over his whole life. His relations with wife Marion (Gina McKee) falter as Jack becomes engulfed in his croupier occupation, drugs, and affairs.\n\nWhen at home with Marion, Jack begins work on a book about a croupier that mirrors Jack’s life through the novel’s character, Jake.\n\nJack becomes entangled in a plan to be the inside man for a planned robbery at his casino by the creditors who are affiliated with Jani, a gambler who he had been seeing.\n\nManfred’s lifestyle leads to tragic consequences as we learn the orchestrator of the planned heist was within Manfred’s own family. Viewers learn the humor and surprise of backstabbing and stopping at nothing to benefit, even if the benefits come from using your own family as a pawn. The anonymity that follows the rest of Manfred’s life after his novel sees publication could be concocted as a fantasy for a viewer to live by by the time that the end credits begin to roll.\n\nOwen’s performance is remarkable and this is a worthy offering of director Mike Hodges. I would highly recommend this. There are elements of the dark and surprising Mona Lisa (1986) throughout.\n\nSexy Beast (2000)\n\nSafecracker Gal retires to the beautiful oceans and landscape of Spain until trouble comes afloat when no-good schemer Don Logan (Ben Kingsley) inquires Gal about one last job alongside his fellow retired friends, Aitch (Cavan Kandall), Harry (Jams Fox), and Teddy Bass (Ian McShane). The undertaking of the heist has personal implications for Gal as the heist is of massive proportions. One person, in particular, will regret the onslaught of the heist in the first place.\n\nKingsley’s Logan is quick to anger and not a very friendly person to become involved with. Having his friendship has stark consequences. That said, for viewers, Kingsley shines as the funnyman, offering knee-slappers throughout the picture.\n\nAlthough the film can be hard to grasp for some, it is enticing and will keep you on the edge of your seat throughout an action-packed ninety or so minutes. For HandMade Films fans, it is very fitting in the neo-noir category avalanched for Britain by Mona Lisa (1986). Although not my favorite, I do recommend Sexy Beast (2000).\n\nI’ll Sleep When I’m Dead (2003)\n\nAnother sampling of director Mike Hodges’ filmography, I’ll Sleep When I’m Dead (2003) centers on Will (Clive Owen) striving to find answers as to why his brother, Graham (Johnathan Rheys-Meyers) was found dead with his throat slashed in a bath tub of blood.\n\nThe film sets out in delicate force as we see Will living in the country losing his job and hallucinating about his brother, Davey, prompting his curiosity over how his brother is doing.\n\nFrank Turner, a notorious crime boss played by Ken Scott, is infuriated at Will’s return and encourages his return back to the countryside after the funeral, in no uncertain terms.\n\nCharlotte Rampling plays Helen, a restaurant owner who was once involved with Will, who tags along with Will in his quest for answers. A meeting with the coroner who executed Davey’s autopsy, as well as a psychologist, reveals the traumatizing reason why Davey committed suicide.\n\nIt is revealed that drug dealers made a call at a party after Darvey made a sale to one of their girlfriends.\n\nAs the film progresses, we learn the dire consequences of jealousy as a hitman sets out to retaliate on a prank carried out by Will’s friends.\n\nMalcolm McDowell is menacing as the villainous Broad and Clive Owen shines in his portrayal of the scarred Will.\n\nWhere there is darkness, there is sometimes quality as what is shown on screen can happen to mirror the experiences of any particular viewer. Those involved with drugs can be struck by the no-nonsense reality of this film. It is riveting. It can be vivid. It is worthy of a watch.\n\nThank you for reading. I hope you enjoyed this extended blog. My Ray of Sunshine for today is simple: If you ever need to rejuvenate yourself, if you are feeling down, angry, happy, etc. I guarantee you that there is a film within the archives of cinema that echoes your feelings and emotions. Film has the power to touch us deeply on an emotional level. HandMade Films did that for me, especially with Withnail & I. Cinema has the power to touch you deeply and help you to forget your troubles, too. I welcome all comments and I hope to ignite discussions on how films make us all feel. Regardless of the emotion you feel, use that emotion positively and put in a movie that reflects how you feel. The cinema is a place of magic and wonder. Movies have the power to change our lives. I bet at least one has changed yours.\n\nP.S. If interested, pick up the Robert Sellers book Very Naughty Boys: The Amazing True Story of HandMade Films. It is a wonderful read!"
