        "text": "After getting his first theatre role by accident – he only went along to support a friend at an audition – Hoskins' screen career got off the ground in 1978 with Dennis Potter's Pennies from Heaven, a six-part series for the BBC; he played sheet-music salesman with a penchant for showtunes and extramarital affairs.\n\nHe then moved on to what is still his defining role The Long Good Friday, still the benchmark for Brit gangster thrillers, and one that still towers over the pale imitators of recent vintage. Hoskins' performance as aspirational hoodlum Harold Shand, ambushed by the IRA, was an absolute barnstormer, filled with instantly quotable lines and beautifully detailed performance. The final scene, as he is driven to his death (that's Pierce Brosnan with the gun, by the way).\n\nHoskins followed Long Good Friday director John Mackenzie onto his next project, an adaptation of Graham Greene's The Honorary Consul. The stars were Richard Gere and Michael Caine, but Hoskins did sterling work behind a dodgy 'tache as local police chief Perez.\n\nSticking close to Gere, Hoskins went up a Hollywood grade to The Cotton Club, cast by Francis Ford Coppola as the club's front man Owney Madden. The sprawling gangland yarn was a flop on release, and earned notoriety after the murder of one of its financial backers, but it's critical reputation has remained high.\n\nHoskins finally found another top notch lead role back in the UK, when Neil Jordan cast him as the ex-con driver of call girl Cathy Tyson. Both desperate and cocky, his acting got him an Oscar nomination, and a Bafta win, and cemented his place as one of Britain's key actors of the 80s.\n\nHollywood came calling again, for the pioneering meld of live action and animation of Who Framed Roger Rabbit? Hoskins, cast as private eye Eddie Valiant after Harrison Ford passed, may have had a rocky American accent, but his ability to interact with non-existent co-stars was impressive.\n\nHoskins changed pace to play second fiddle to Cher and Winona Ryder in Mermaids: he is steadying-influence local shopkeeper Lou, who tames Cher's wildcat mother. Perhaps not Hoskins' finest role, but the film has a cheeriness that has kept it fresh.\n\nArguably his biggest disaster was agreeing to appear in the SuperMarioBros film in 1993 - a videogame adaptation that Hoskins never managed to live down.\n\nBy the time Shane Meadows appeared on the scene, and was ready to make his feature debut Twenty Four Seven, Hoskins represented the old school, a touchstone figure to be given due homage. Meadows handed him the lead role of a boxing gym operator who tries to get the local youths off the streets.\n\nIn the late 90s Hoskins may no longer have been a major draw, but he turned up in arguably his strangest film: Felicia's Journey, from Canadian-Amenian auteur Atom Egoyan. Adapted from William Trevor's novel, Hoskins played a sinister Brummie catering manager who befriends the hapless teenager of the title. Hoskins is properly creepy in the role, an overlooked mini-masterpiece.\n\nAs one of the quartet of ashes-scatterers on a car journey to the seashore, Hoskins was possibly not stretching himself in Last Orders, but as a status-definer it was perfect: Blow-Up's David Hemmings, Tom Courtenay and Ray Winstone were in the car too, with Michael Caine hovering overhead.\n\nAfter the Last Orders boost, Stephen Frears cast Hoskins as Soho nudie-club legend Vivian \"VD\" Van Damm, opposite Judi Dench in Mrs Henderson Presents. Hoskins donned a tweed suit and a posh accent to play Van Damm, forever squabbling with theatre owner Laura Henderson.\n\nHoskins went back to his working-class roots for Made in Dagenham, as the grandfatherly shop steward who encourages Sally Hawkins and co to stage their strike for equal pay.\n\nAs a coda to a distinguished career, it's more apposite than the overheated Snow White and the Huntsman; the blind dwarf Hoskins played in the latter became his final role.\n\nMore on Bob Hoskins"
