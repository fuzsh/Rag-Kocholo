        "text": "British actor Bob Hoskins announced that he is retiring from acting after being diagnosed with Parkinson's disease.\n\n\"He wishes to thank all the great and brilliant people he has worked with over the years, and all of his fans who have supported him during a wonderful career,\" rep for the Golden Globe-winning actor said Wednesday in a statement to BBC. \"Bob is now looking forward to his retirement with his family, and would greatly appreciate that his privacy be respected at this time.\"\n\nHoskins, 69, was diagnosed late last year.\n\nHis career started with roles on British television shows in the 1960s and 1970s. His breakthrough role was as gangster Harold Shand in \"The Long Good Friday\" opposite Helen Mirren. He also earned a Golden Globe and a Best Actor Oscar nomination for his role as a criminal named George in 1986's \"Mona Lisa.\"\n\nHis most memorable role to American audiences was likely that of private investigator Eddie Valiant in the groundbreaking 1988 movie \"Who Framed Roger Rabbit,\" which combined live-action with animation. More recently, Hoskins played the dwarf named Muir opposite Kristen Stewart in \"Snow White and the Huntsman. \"Hoskins' other film credits include \"Mermaids,\" \"Hook\" and \"Nixon.\""
