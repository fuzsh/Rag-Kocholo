        "text": "Bob Hoskins, whose death at 71 was announced today, was one of the most talented character actors in movie and TV history. His prodigious output demonstrates a huge acting range, in leads and supporting roles, over several decades. Here are some highlights:\n\n‘Pennies From Heaven’ (1978)\n\nAfter seven years of low-profile work mostly in British TV, Hoskins broke through as a Depression Era sheet-music salesman who lip-synchs in this groundbreaking mini-series. Steve Martin took his part in the inferior 1981 American feature version.\n\n‘The Long Good Friday’ (1980)\n\nHoskins established himself as an international film star in this seminal gangster film for which he received a British academy award nomination. In the film scene, he betrays a wide range of emotions without saying a word.\n\n‘Othello’ (1981)\n\nHoskins played many famous literary characters — among them Sancho Panza and Micawber — as he alternated between films and TV for the rest of his career. Here he delivers Iago’s first-act soliloquy from a BBC production of “Othello.”\n\n‘The Cotton Club’ (1984)\n\nHoskins was much in demand on both sides of the Atlantic, often the best thing in his Hollywood assignments. In this famous flop, he plays underworld-connected Cotton Club owner Owney Madden — one of many real-life characters in a gallery that includes Nikita Kruschchev, J. Edgar Hoover, Benito Mussolini, Winston Churchill, Manuel Noriega and Pope John XXIII. He was also supposed to play Al Capone in “The Untouchables,’’ but was paid off with $400,000 after Robert De Niro changed his mind and decided to do it.\n\n‘Mona Lisa’ (1986)\n\nHoskins’ only Oscar nomination came for one of his most touching performances, as a parolee who falls in love with the high-end call girl he is chauffeuring.\n\n‘Who Framed Roger Rabbit’ (1988)\n\nHoskins’ most famous role is in a tour de force in a live action/animated classic that finds him back in splenetic mode as a toon-hating detective who finds himself helping to clear Roger of murder.\n\n‘Mermaids’ (1990)\n\nHoskins as a romantic interest for single mother Cher, helping her raise Winona Ryder and Christina Ricci? It sounded unlikely but turned out to be utterly delightful.\n\n‘Hook’ (1991)\n\nHoskins’ comic Smee was the high point of this Steven Spielberg disastrous fantasy epic. Here he steals a scene from Dustin Hoffman’s Captain Hook.\n\n‘Mrs. Henderson Presents’ (2005)\n\nHe’s a tough but kind theatrical impresario who helps eccentric widow Judi Dench save her theater by staging near-nude revues during World War II in this fact-based comedy-drama.\n\n‘Hollywoodland’ (2006)\n\nMenacing again as real-life MGM mogul Eddie Mannix, who may have had something to do with the death of TV’s Superman George Reeves (Ben Affleck)."
