        "text": "September 1986 - British Vogue\n\nBob Hoskins is forty-three years old, 5ft 6in tall and weighs fifteen stone. Large, rosy pointed ears stand out from his powerful head, and he wears his remaining hair as short as wood-grain, like a Roman praetor. He has the broad blunt hands of a mole, and gives frequent thoughtful tugs to his nose. When he is acting rage, which he does superlatively well, nearly all the white shows round his gum-drop eyes, and his mouth folds and unfolds into the most menacing snarl ever captured on celluloid. Anyone who has seen The Long Good Friday will remember that final terrifying shot of Hoskins as the captured gangster sitting in the back of a limousine, his face working in silent fury, his mouth contorted to the shape of a belt buckle lined with bared white teeth. Even as soft-hearted George in Mona Lisa, he is still quite combustible and gives mincingly convincing displays of groin-kicking, face-smashing and head-butting. But how far does the real Bob Hoskins conform to this image of extreme physicality?\n\nDo you play any sport?\n\nSport bores the life out of me. I'm the least competitive person you've ever met. The only game I have quite enjoyed is chess.\n\nDo you take any form of exercise?\n\nI go to Alan Talbot's gym in the East End. Have done for years. I find I have to change shape to play different parts, so I go to Alan and tell him the shape I want to be. For the character of Stanley in Sweet Liberty, I had to be quite dapper, neurotic, a bit of a mother's boy; so I told Alan I wanted less shoulders, more belly and a bigger bum. I ended up looking like Tweedledum, which is what was needed. Right after Stanley I had to play George. George is very solid and muscular, just out of prison; less belly and more shoulders than Stanley, but he couldn't look sleek. I only had two weeks to get George looking right, so I worked out all morning every day. Alan talked me through it. We're like a pair of old gossips.\n\nDid you mind when you started to go bald?\n\nNo. It started happening when I was thirty-two. I've always had short hair. I don't like hair getting in the way, so when it started to go, it was a bit of a godsend really ... Obviously I'd love a headful of curly black hair. 'Course I would! But there's loads of us about, the baldies. Hundreds and thousands of us. It's funny but when you go into any group, you find the baldies do always gravitate towards each other. You're never alone with a bald head.\n\nDo you lose your temper easily?\n\nVery rarely. I make a lot of noise now and again, shouting and all that. But I'm not an aggressive type.\n\nHave you ever been involved in a fight in real life?\n\nYou're joking! Every kid's had a fight. Yeah! But I wouldn't call myself a violent person. I don't like it. Fortunately people don't pick on me when they're looking for a fight. That's the benefit of being short; there's no kudos involved in fighting with a shorty. My advice is, if any trouble looks like starting - run. The idea that two adult intelligent people would stand there battering together like a pair of rams is ridiculous.\n\nSo you've never been in a proper grown-up punch-up?\n\n... Well. Yes. Of course. Erm. Ah, oh yes, about - ooh! - six years ago. One of those things that happen while you're driving. This bloke got out and I got out. There was all that shouting and screaming. We started a fight. Fortunately he was in exactly the same shape I was. We lasted five seconds. Neither of us landed a punch. We were both sitting on the floor out of breath. Then we wound up down the pub. That was that. The only fight I've had for years and years.\n\nAre you brave?\n\nKnocking someone out isn't brave. That's just destructive. I think it takes real bravery for ordinary people now to bring up kids, with unemployment as it is and with the line this government is taking. That takes real bravery...\n\nBob Hoskins has played more than his fair share of megalomaniacs, tyrants and villains. His roles have included Richard III, the fiendish Bosola in The Duchess of Malfi, Iago, Napoleon, Mussolini, East End gangster Harold Shand in The Long Good Friday, devious Nathan Detroit in Guys and Dolls, Ronnie Kray in England, England by Snoo Wilson and Kevin Coyne, and mobster Owney Madden in Francis Coppola's The Cotton Club. But Hoskins is vexed by those who assume he always plays villains.\n\nYou have played a number of villainous roles in your time. Why do you think th---\n\nNo I haven't! Not really! Not when you look at all the other parts I've played too. All right, Iago was a bit of a villain. In fact he was one of the living dead. Jonathan Miller gave me the accurate psychological framework to start from, and I played Iago as the case history of a psychopath.\n\nBut what about all- the others? What about Arthur Parker in Pennies from Heaven? Arthur is Everyman; that part had every self-contradictory human quality in it. Or Morrie Mendellsohn in The Dunera Boys? You wouldn't call him a bad man! And Amie Cole in Flickers! He might be a spiv and a megalomaniac, but he's also a man of vision and tenderness. And what about old Sheppey (the lead in Anthony Page's BBC production of a play by Somerset Maugham)? People said that play was rubbish but I thought it was wonderful. The amazing thing about Sheppey is that he has a deep love of humanity which he's never been able to show until he suddenly wins a fortune on the horses.\n\nNow that you've made your fortune, do you try, like Sheppey, to use some of it to help other people?\n\nThat's my business. It's a very private thing; I've no reason to do it except for me. And that's that.\n\nTo return to the villains: I understand that your portrayal of gangster Harold Shand was so convincing that the Kray brothers sent fan mail.\n\nWhen I did The Long Good Friday, I went down the clubs to meet the chaps, and said, \"Teach me how to be a gangster.\"\n\nWhich clubs?\n\nLeave off. Anyway, afterwards they gave me an Omega watch. \"As a present of appreciation,\" they said. It was a bizarre thing; it worked on sound, but it didn't work on me. In the end I gave it to Sammy, my driver, because it worked on him.\n\nI would have thought you would enjoy the baroque London settings and dangerous language of Steven Berkoff s plays. Do you admire his work?\n\nI know Steve well. He's brilliant. This country doesn't make enough of him. If he were living in France or the USA, they'd praise him to the skies. But here, he's having to play bit parts to get the dough together to do his next production. Pathetic! I would like to produce something with Steve where both our imaginations were at work. We work in very different ways. But I'd like to make a film with Steve where I put myself in the reverse situation, so that I was directing him.\n\nTell me about your Shakespearean career.\n\nI started off understudying minor roles in rep at Stoke-on-Trent. My first part was Peter, the nurse's servant in Romeo and Juliet. The audience thought I was hilarious because I was the wrong shape for Shakespeare. I looked like an Elizabethan pillar-box. But it was when I played Richard III in rep at Hull that it all first made a real impression on me. I sat down to read it in one of those Complete Works. I couldn't put it down when I'd finished Richard III, I just kept on reading. Macbeth, Lear, Hamlet, I read about six of the major works straight off. The language! But when I went to see it in the theatre I was disappointed. Shakespeare gets murdered in performance. I've liked very few of the productions I've seen. I liked the Theatre of Odessa's Richard III at the Round House. They gave it everything, basking in their own language so there was none of that over-respectfulness you get in English productions. A certain English reserve has grown since Shakespeare's day which takes away from the passion in his plays. I don't mean demon-king ranting; I mean passion, the genuine article. If an actor didn't come up with the genuine article for the people who went to the theatre in Shakespeare's day, he'd get an orange chucked in his chops.\n\nHave you ever thought of playing Caliban?\n\nNo! But there is a part in The Tempest I would love to play. Ariel. He's great. A street urchin. A very petulant creature. We always treat magic as airy-fairy pantomime stuff; but I've come across real magic quite a lot in my life. I would treat magic as a force to be reckoned with. And I would play Ariel as a sort of Tottenham Court Road car salesman because he's always doing deals. He says to Prospero, \"Look! I done you a favour, you said I could go now. How much more have I gotta do?\" But nobody ever would cast me as Ariel; it would cost them a fortune to swing me up on a line.\n\nIs there any other role you are ambitious to play?\n\nThey're planning to make the ultimate film of The Wind in the Willows. And they've offered me Mole. I am desperate to play Mole. I played Alfred the Horse once in Toad of Toad Hall, but this time I've got to be Mole..."
