Similarly, his sequel film Saheb, Biwi Aur Gangster Returns had gained critical acclaim. He is also well known for his role as Ramadhir Singh in Anurag Kashyap’s modern cult film Gangs of Wasseypur. [10] Dhulia holds a Master’s Degree in Theatre from the National School of Drama.\n\nIn 1990 he moved to Mumbai where he worked as casting director on the film Bandit Queen, a biopic of Phoolan Devi. He was casting director for 1995’s Stiff Upper Lips, in which he also had a cameo role as a stallholder, and 2000’s The Warrior, directed by Asif Kapadia. Dhulia started his direction career, by assisting Pradip Krishen in Electric Moon (1992) and Ketan Mehta in Sardar (1993).\n\nThereafter he turned to television, thus during the 90s Dhulia directed and produced several television programs, including the six-part Krishna’s Dream for UK Channel Four. Kahani Ek Kanya Ki (1991) was written for Doordarshan, and Hum Bambai Nahin Jayenge (1993), for BI Television, was set in an acting school. 1996’s Just Mohabbat was the story of a boy’s coming-of-age, and Naya Daur (1995) adapted a classic Hindi novel by Bhagwati Charan Verma for Zee TV.\n\nDhulia’s 1999 series Star Bestsellers, a sequence of six 45-minute short stories (“Ek Sham Ki Mulaqat”, “Fursat Main”, “Hum Saath Saath Hain Kya”, “Anekon Hitler”, “Musafir”, and “Bhawaron Ne Khilaya Phool”), won him popular recognition.

With it’s commercial box-office success in India, Nagesh has created a new genre in Indian cinema – the indie film that breaks the traditional barrier of both commercial and art cinema.\n\nRockford, a coming of age story of any boarding school going kid, his second film also written and directed by him, follows the same style of film making- of telling empathetic stories that are real and everyday, as well as entertaining. Besides it’s tour of several film festivals, beginning with the Austin Film Festival in 1999, the film was also commercially successful, doing over 16 weeks of business in India.\n\nBollywood Calling, the filmmaker’s third film, stars Om Puri and Naveen Nischol in the lead. This film also had a very successful commercial run in India and other countries with Indian Diaspora.\n\nHis next film 3 Deewarein is another ‘genre bender’ on the Indian movie front combining elements of drama and mystery and boasting of an impressive star cast of Naseeruddin Shah and two of India’s biggest Hindi stars Jackie Shroff and Juhi Chawla. The film has been acclaimed critically in India and abroad. It also won the writer-director, Nagesh, a premier Indian award, Film Fare award, in the best original story category.\n\nHyderabad Blues-2 : Rearranged Marriage, the fifth film from the director, is a sequel to Hyderabad Blues, a film that started it all. Picking up six years from where it left off, HB2 also casts Nagesh in its lead.\n\nIqbal, featuring Naseeruddin Shah, Girish Karnad and Shreyas Talpade, is an inspiring story of a deaf mute boy from a small town in rural India who dreams of making it to the Indian cricket team. Released in 2005, the film was a huge box office success and has been included as mandatory reading in many middle school text books. This film won many awards for the director and acting awards for the cast.\n\nLoosely based on a true incident, Nagesh’s next film ‘Dor’, starring Shreyas Talpade, Ayesha Takia, is a story of two women of different worlds coming together. This film received rave reviews, was a run away success at box office and screened at many international festivals.\n\nHis Bombay to Bangkok, again starring Shreyas Talpade and Lena Christensen, is a whacky romantic comedy released in early 2008. In 2009, shifting gears yet again, Nagesh tackled the action thriller genre about a man with the ability to see the past in 8 X 10 Tasveer starring Akshay Kumar.\n\nNagesh’s next film Aashayein opened in August of 2010 to rave reviews and tells the story of a man who learns to live life all over again when he realizes he has ninety days left to live.His next release Mod, is a romantic drama and tells the story of a lonely girl who runs a watch store in a small town in India and a stranger with a mysterious past shows up at her doorstep to have his watch repaired.\n\nHis last film Lakshmi is based on a harrowing true story of a girl who was sold into prostitution at 14, but who once rescued had the courage to sue her traffickers successfully in a landmark case in the state of Andhra Pradesh in southern India.\n\nThe film has been to numerous festivals and has won numerous awards, primarily the Audience Award in Palm Springs for the Best Film, Best International Feature at the Toronto Reel World Film Festival and Best Director at the Stuttgart Indian Film Festival.His current film Dhanak (Rainbow) is the story of an eight-year old blind boy and his sister and the magical journey they take across the desert state of Rajasthan to get his eyesight back.\n\nIn 2003 the film was discovered in a glowing DVD review on Site and Sound magazine – a larger version of this review eventually found its way into an independent list of 46 underrated works of world cinema (Gentleman Magazine, India). Dil Pe Mat Le Yaar was followed by a breezy gangster film called Chhal (Deceit, 2001) which for reasons unknown to Hansal has been regarded as a cult film and has met with more praise than his previous film (his personal favorite).\n\nHansal’s early films reflected various subcultures that inhabit the culturally complex city of Bombay (now Mumbai). After these films Hansal made unsuccessful attempts at films that pandered to the mainstream sensibility while continuing to work with newer talents. Among these were the comedy Yeh Kya Ho Raha Hai (What’s Happening, 2002), a gangster drama Raakh (Ashes, 2005), a short film in Dus Kahaniyaan (Ten Stories, 2007) and Woodstock Villa (2008).\n\nDisappointed with his output and his attempts to make films that did not reflect his independent sensibilities, Hansal went on an extended sabbatical to explore social work, rural life and new stories. Shahid (2012) is the result of this soul searching mission and a return to roots for Hansal. Shahid is a deeply personal story that reflects Hansal’s anger and concern towards religious/class based/racial intolerance around the world. He calls it “an attempt to exorcise the demons of 2000 when I was attacked by intolerant political parties and was forced to remain silent out of fear for my life”. Shahid won Hansal Mehta the 61st National Award for Best Direction and its lead actor Rajkummar Rao the National Award for Best Actor.\n\nClose on the heels of Shahid’s theatrical release in October 2013, Hansal Mehta teamed with Rajkummar Rao to make the acclaimed ‘Citylights’ (an official adaptation of the British Indie hit ‘Metro Manila’) for Fox star Studios and Mahesh Bhatt.\n\nHansal has also dabbled in television with India’s longest running food show, Khana Khazana and many other television series that were considered acclaimed for their non-conformist approach compared to the mainstream Indian television industry. In his spare time Hansal experiments with Indian cuisine and his home is regularly frequented by unsuspecting friends who are subjected to his culinary digressions. He also loves ranting through blogs and amateurish free-verse poetry on his website that is humbly called www.hansalmehta.com. The humble website also lists out some of Hansal’s more successful Indian recipes."
