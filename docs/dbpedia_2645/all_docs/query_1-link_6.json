        "text": "Tigmanshu Dhulia's Bullett Raja features Saif Ali Khan and Sonakshi Sinha.\n\nMumbai: Filmmaker Tigmanshu Dhulia sayshe roped in Saif Ali Khan for his upcoming action-crimethriller Bullett Raja as the movie required a superstar torake in box office earnings.\n\nThe 46-year-old director, who has made films likeHaasil, Saheb Biwi Aur Gangster and Paan Singh Tomaramong others, said a high budget film demands the \"stars\" ofBollywood.\n\n\"When you are working on a high budget film, the pressurerequires you to have an actor, who can pull that off at thebox office. And I think only he (Saif) can justify that kindof budget. So, we had to get a star. Luckily, Saif wasinterested in this space,\" Tigmanshu told PTI.\n\nTigmanshu has often chosen serious topics for his moviesbut this time around he found it interesting to come out witha masala entertainer.\n\n\"I have never made a film like this before. As comparedto Paan Singh Tomar and Saheb Biwi and Gangster, which wereserious films, this is an entertainer. Bullett Raja has allthe aspects of a commercial film which you can enjoy in thetheatre,\" he said.\n\n\"I was apprehensive initially if I would be able to pullit off. If I roped in somebody who had already done a filmlike this it would have not been a challenge,\" he added.\n\nActress Sonakshi Sinha will be seen playing the leadinglady opposite Saif in the movie and the director says he foundthe chemistry between the two actors extra-ordinary. BullettRaja will hit theatres on November 29.\n\n\"Sonakshi is a star and she has done successful films, sowe needed somebody like her. But the reason we cast her isthat she looks Bengali because of her big eyes, dusky andclassic looks. She was perfect to play a Bengali character inthe film.\n\n\"Other reason is that I feel that when you're castingmale and female lead, there should be some contrast betweenthem because then their chemistry gets better. Saif is veryfair and Sonakshi is dusky, they look fabulous together,\" hesaid.\n\nBesides direction, Tigmanshu has acted in films likeSaheb Biwi Aur Gangster, Anurag Kashyap's Gangs ofWasseypur and Hansal Mehta's Shahid, but he has no plans totake up acting as a full time career.\n\n\"I think I have just done two scenes in Shahid becauseHansal, who is my friend asked me to do it. I did it forAnurag because he is a friend. I only work with friends, whenthey ask me to act. It is not that I am looking at it as analternate career,\" he said.\n\nBullett Raja also stars Jimmy Shergill, Chunky Pandey,Ravi Kishan, Gulshan Grover and Vidyut Jamwal.\n\nEntertainment I Read Latest News on NDTV Entertainment.
