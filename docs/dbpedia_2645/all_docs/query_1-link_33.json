        "text": "Lucknowite Ali Fazal will be playing the main lead in the film.\n\n“We will shoot the film in Lucknow, Mathura and Vrindavan. I have done the ground work in all three cities and we will start the shoot in March. We are yet to decide whether we will start the shoot from Mathura or Lucknow,” says Tigmanshu, who was in the state capital for a two-day recce.\n\nHe is now zeroing in on the talkies on which the film is based.\n\n“The film is about single screen and situation of such talkie is actually really bad in current days. They have lost its old world charm. We will shoot in portions like exterior can be of one cinema, interior of other and projection room somewhere else. We have seen many in Lucknow — Gulaab, Pratibha, Jai Bharat and Hind,” he says.\n\nEarlier he had identified Allahabad-based Palace talkies for the shoot.\n\n“We will not be shooting in Allahabad anymore. It’s not the same city in which we lived,” he says.\n\nTalking about the film’s cast, Tigmanshu says, “Ali is from Lucknow and he best suits the role. Leading lady will be finalized in a day or two. Besides, we will have Sanjay Mishra and Pankaj Tripathi.”\n\nEarlier, names of lot actors have done round for the film, including that of Imran Khan, Priyanka Chopra, Shahid Kapoor, Aditya Roy Kapoor, Shraddha Kapoor and Kartik Aryan.\n\nWhile filmmaker Ekta Kapoor (Balaji) had previous agreed to produce the film, it will now be a Film Keeda Productions.\n\nSeveral other locations such as La Martiniere College, Centennial College, River Front and some old houses have already been identified for the shoot.\n\nIn a previous chat with HT, he had said, “I wanted to do a love story in the current context when the definition of love has changed completely. With WhatsApp, Internet, video chats and mobiles, communication has become very easy nowadays. It is not like it used to be in our younger days when letters were prevalent and landline were also very less. So, I want to do the love story in today’s era but for them communication is still not easy. The conflict in this love story is not caste or religion — its communication.”\n\nTigmanshu has recently completed the shoot for Saheb, Biwi Aur Gangaster3 with Sanjay Dutt, Jimmy Shergill, Mahi Gill and Chitrangada Singh. “The film is now going in post-production. We are planning a May-June release. It has been shot in Bikaner, Jodhpur and Mumbai. It starts from its sequel and moves ahead.”\n\nShooting for his film Yaara starring Vidyut Jamwal, Amit Sadh, Vijay Verma and Kenny has also been completed and he hopes to release the film around the release of SBG3."
