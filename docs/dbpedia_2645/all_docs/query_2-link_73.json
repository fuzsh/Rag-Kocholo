        "text": "Tigmanshu, who has suddenly become a cash cow after the back-to-back success of Sahib Biwi Aur Gangster and Paan Singh Tomar is in a meeting with a producer type in his inner office. Meeting over, the director half sincerely apologises for the delay. We both know that he would rather sit in the sanctum sanctorum and crack deals rather than give interviews. Before I can begin to question him, I’m greeted by a growl. It’s coming from Saibaan, the tailless mongrel adopted by Tigmanshu. “They brought her to me and we took her to the vet and got her treated. Her infected tail had to be cut. It was at the time of Sahib Biwi Aur Gangster. In fact, it was Jimmy (Shergill) who named her Saibaan. She’s proved lucky for me as after adopting her, my fortunes have turned.” Tigmanshu has always found pets to be therapeutic. Especially dogs. “No work was coming my way after Charas flopped. But I had to satisfy my ego somehow. So I bought a Labrador and named him Action. So I would say ‘Action’ 200 times a day and satiate my ego.” he laughs. “Also, Action was happy to see me for no reason at all at a time when my so-called friends weren’t acknowledging my presence. That was a mood booster too.”\n\nIt took him seven years to overcome the debacle of Charas. Seven dark years when everything was going wrong with him. “I had become the living example of Murphy’s Law. Whatever could go wrong, did go wrong. For example, I started a period film with Sunny Deol, a multi-crore project... the producer ‘fell’ from a multi-storeyed building, broke almost all his bones and suddenly I didn’t have a film. I was to start a film with Yash Raj Films... I even met Aditya Chopra... he told me to chalk it all out and then nothing came of it.”\n\nI can deal with a flop but not this. As filmmakers we live to see the release of our products and it was as if there was no light at the end of the tunnel.”\n\nIt’s strange that he didn’t use his good offices with Uday Chopra, who is Adi’s younger brother, to boost the project. Tigmanshu gives a wry smile and says Uday stopped being a friend sometime after Charas was declared a flop. “We were quite close while shooting Charas but he stopped communicating afterwards. We exchange messages once in awhile but that’s it. Ours isn’t the sort of friendship where I can lean on him.” The people he could lean on, actors like Jimmy Shergill and Irrfan Khan, weren’t in a position to help him out. “They did offer me great emotional support. They know of my dreams and aspirations. They aren’t my social friends. We don’t need to meet every day as we know we are there for each other.”\n\nHe’s happy that Sahib… has given a boost to Jimmy’s career. Tigmanshu is all set to start a sequel to the film and, if rumours are to be believed, the film has hot, hot scenes between new entrants Soha Ali Khan and Irrfan. The director says one shouldn’t believe everything that’s printed in the papers. “I haven’t shown my script to anyone so I don’t know where these rumours started.” He admits he wouldn’t have made the sequel if Sahib... wasn’t a hit. “It’s a whole new territory right now. Continuity is going to be a bitch. Hopes are high, the actors would want to be one up… I’m going to go crazy these next few months.”\n\nIrrfan, who made an impact with the intense portrayal of a steeplechase runner turned dreaded dacoit in Paan Singh Tomar is a strange choice to play a thakur in the Sahib… sequel. The director says he shares a comfort zone with the chameleon-like actor. “We shot Paan Singh Tomar on difficult terrain with a shoestring budget. I wasn’t able to provide creature comforts to my actors but no one complained. Especially Irrfan who, believe me, is used to all kinds of pampering while shooting for Hollywood productions. He adapted beautifully to the milieu and started behaving, speaking like a native. It was as if he was born for the role.” Tigmanshu was carrying the seeds of Paan Singh ever since he was an AD on Shekhar Kapur’s Bandit Queen. It was a long journey frought with much heartburn. “I wanted Paan Singh to be my first film. It was like a nagging itch that never went away. I’m glad it finally saw the light of the day as now I can move on to something else.”\n\nHe could have gotten a younger looking Irrfan if he’d made Paan Singh Tomar some 10-15 years ago. One complaint about the film is that Irrfan looks too old for the role. Tigmanshu comes loyally to his friend’s defence and says he couldn’t have made the film with any other actor. “Who else could have played the role? No one else came close.” I suggest Ranveer Singh’s name and he looks flabbergasted. “You’re joking, right? Ranveer still needs time to be an actor. He might become an actor in maybe 15 years. Yeh log gym mein bane actors hain. They go to these fancy gyms and spas and think they are actors just because they are handsome.”\n\nTigmanshu declares that once upon a time his favourite actor was Govinda. “I was a total Govinda fan. I thought he was a fantastic actor. Unfortunately, when I first went to him, he was a big star and I was a nobody. I told him I have a fantastic comedy for him and he said he wanted me to adapt a Dada Kondke film. Things just didn’t work out.” The maverick informs he did start a film with Govinda during his seven not so good years. “We almost completed the film. Some 40 days work still remains. The producer lost interest... And I’m saddled with yet another unfinished film.”\n\nTigmanshu knows he is no messiah and can’t convert the bulk of filmmakers to his views. “Our filmmakers sadly don’t have that faith in their products. They just want to have a quick fix solution to make money so they make a Housefull.” There were rumours that he was keen to cast Rani Mukerji for a role in a historical film. The director informs me he’s fascinated by the life of Begum Samru and finds Rani suitable for the role.\n\nThe director had been working 24X7 for the past three years and wants to take his wife Tulika and daughter Jaansi for a vacation before he starts work. Jaansi is an unusual name and I want to know why he opted for it. “It’s all thanks to Mani Ratnam,” laughs Tigmanshu. “There is a line in the song Ae ajnabi from Dil Se which goes, ‘Woh jaansi kahan hai…’ my wife loved the line and thought Jaansi would be an apt name for our daughter. It’s unusual but apt. She’s our lifeline. Her name conveys our feelings for her.”\n\nUnusual but nice. Just what we have come to expect from the maverick filmmaker."
