        "text": "Comparisons between “Bullett Raja” and “R…Rajkumar” have been doing the rounds ever since the release of the two films was announced on two successive Fridays. But Prabhudheva and Tigmanshu Dhulia feel the comparisons are not only odious, they are also uncalled for.\n\nWhile Saif Ali Khan starrer ‘Bullett Raja’ came out on November 29, Shahid Kapoor’s ‘R…Raajkumar’ was released on December 6 and none could do wonders at the box office.\n\nThe comparisons were drawn due to the similarities like both the films are crime drama with a good dose of romance, the protagonists are ruffians, and the plots are based in the small town. In both films, Sonakshi Sinha has played the female lead.\n\n“I’ve the highest regard for Tigmanshu Dhulia’s work. He’s such a brilliant director. I really don’t see any point of comparison between his film and mine, except Sonakshi who is common to the cast of both films. We are very different filmmakers. And I am sure we’ve made very different films. His film has its own energy, mine has its own,” said the choreographer-director.\n\n“I don’t think I can make films like Prabhudheva. His films have a peculiar high-level energy. Many have tried to imitate it. I’d be foolish to even attempt doing something similar,” Dhulia said."
