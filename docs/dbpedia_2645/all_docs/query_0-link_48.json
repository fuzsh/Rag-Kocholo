        "text": "Saif Ali Khan, a prominent figure in Bollywood, has had a remarkable journey in the film industry, especially during the 90s. His acting debut in 1993 with the action drama, Parampara, marked the beginning of a successful career. Over the years, Saif has earned numerous accolades, including a National Film Award and seven Filmfare Awards. In recognition of his contributions, he was honoured with the Padma Shri, India’s fourth-highest civilian award, in 2010. However, Saif’s film career as an actor has witnessed its share of ups and downs.\n\nRemarkably, Saif Ali Khan still holds a unique record that eludes many talented Bollywood actors to this day. He ranks seventh on Box Office India’s ‘Hit Count Actor All Time’ list, a testament to his enduring appeal. His record includes 12 points, comprising two blockbusters, one superhit, and nine hit films, reflecting his consistent ability to captivate audiences with his on-screen presence.\n\nEven in the present day, Saif remains active on both the silver screen and OTT platforms, showcasing his versatility as an actor. His recent appearance in the action-adventure drama Adipurush attests to his enduring popularity.\n\nContinue reading →\n\n1/15 Story of how Saif Ali Khan prepared for his role in ‘Go Goa Gone’ will leave you puzzled\n\nRaj and DK’s ‘Go Goa Gone’ remains one of the first and only zombie movies Bollywood has ever had. While the fans await the makers to come up with the second instalment of the film, we got hold of a small detail pertaining to the first part.\n\nAccording to reports, for Saif, who played the role of Boris, it was a task to get into the skin of his character who sported a golden hair and faked a Russian accent. The makers, it is said, came up with an idea to help Saif go ahead with his character. They got him ‘The Zombie Survival Guide’ by Max Brooks which apparently has a hilarious take on a zombie invasion. Needless to say, Saif pulled off his character with ease.\n\nThe makers are reportedly now returning with the sequel to the film. The shooting for the film will start in January, next year.\n\nContinue reading →\n\nWell, the war between actors Shahid Kapoor and Saif Ali Khan is on, and no, Kareena Kapoor Khan is not the reason why the Batti Gul Meter Chalu actor has challenged the Sacred Games actor.\n\nBefore you start cursing us for not revealing the reason why Shahid has open challenged Saif, let us tell you that Shahid has said that he might just grow a longer beard than the Nawab.\n\nFor the uninitiated, Saif Ali Khan has been sporting a full facial fuzz for Navdeep Singh directorial Hunter, in which he is will be seen essaying the role of a Naga sadhu.\n\nContinue reading →\n\nSaif Ali Khan will be co-hosting the 18th edition of the International Indian Film Academy Awards along with filmmaker Karan Johar in New York on July 15\n\nActor Saif Ali Khan is all set to co-host the 18th edition of the International Indian Film Academy Awards along with filmmaker Karan Johar in New York on July 15. In a statement to the media, the 46-year-old actor said that they have a ‘lot of surprises’ in store for their fans: “I am happy to be back to the IIFA stage this year as I join my close friend Karan Johar to host the IIFA Awards in New York. The excitement for IIFA has been steadily growing worldwide. This year it’s going to be super fun and glamorous in every way as Karan and I are going to have lots of surprises in store for our fans internationally!,” said Saif Ali Khan.\n\nContinue reading →\n\nFrom dressing sassy showgirls to recreating period army uniforms in Rangoon, costume designer Dolly Ahluwalia discusses the challenges of a historical wartime romance.\n\nWHEN two-time National Award-winning costume designer Dolly Ahluwalia says that Vishal Bhardwaj’s war and romance drama Rangoon has been the toughest movie of her career, she’s not kidding. With films such as Bandit Queen (1993), Omkara (2006) and Haider (2014) under her belt, she’s no stranger to large-scale spectacles and sweeping canvases. But Bhardwaj’s latest, set during World War II and shot largely in Arunachal Pradesh, proved to be a formidable challenge. The experience was much like the volatile storyline of the love triangle between livewire action heroine Julia (played by Kangna Ranaut), erstwhile actor and debonair producer Rusi Billimoria (Saif Ali Khan) and soldier Nawab Mallik (Shahid Kapoor).\n\nArmed with keywords such as “love triangle”, “war”, “aristocracy”, “comedy”, “tragedy” and “sensuousness”, Ahluwalia set about creating a canvas for each of her characters. “I watched a lot of Hollywood and Bollywood films from the ’40s to see what the fashion was like back then, delved into old fashion magazines that I sourced from London and studied people’s personal albums to gauge the Western trends that had percolated down to India,” she says.\n\nContinue reading →"
