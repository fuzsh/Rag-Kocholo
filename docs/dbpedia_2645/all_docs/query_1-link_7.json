        "text": "In an industry like Bollywood, nobody has just one particular job. People who write scripts and dialogues can also be hairstylists and directors can also be music directors, or even actors. And that's one of the things we love so much about the industry. There is a great exchange of creativity across the medium that makes its byproduct such a joy to watch. One of the most common crossovers we've seen in Bollywood has been directors turning actors. While some of them pleasantly surprised us, some were quite disappointing. But here are six of them who we would definitely like to see in front of the camera again, soon.\n\nAnurag Kashyap\n\nAnurag has played small roles in multiple films, but it was his villainous role in Akira that really showcased his acting talent. We're well-aware of his brilliant directing abilities, and now we know he can hold his own on screen as well. While he maintains that he doesn't want to act, we hope he still keeps popping up in roles here and there.\n\nKaran Johar\n\nDilwale Dulhania Le Jayenge was a big film for Karan Johar, not only because it was the first film he worked on, but because it was also because it was his first time onscreen. While he's been on our television screens predominantly for multiple shows since then, it was his full-fledged role in fellow director-turned-actor, Anurag Kashyap's film Bombay Velvet that had everyone talking. The film unfortunately didn't fare well, but people were quite impressed by Karan's role in the film. We're not surprised, though, that besides being a great director, we also think he was made to be in front of the camera.\n\nPrakash Jha\n\nAcclaimed filmmaker Prakash Jha never seemed like someone who we would see in front of the camera. But when he first took to acting in 2010's Raajneeti, we were pleasantly surprised. He even shared screen space with Priyanka Chopra in last year's Jal Gangaajal, and received a lot of praise. What's even more brilliant is that these two films were his own directorial ventures! We definitely wouldn't be able to handle two such high pressure tasks with as much ease.\n\nTigmanshu Dhulia\n\nAnother director who managed to really impress us with his acting abilities was none other than the Paan Singh Tomar and Haasil director, Tigmanshu Dhulia. His roles in Gangs of Wasseypur, Shahid and Manjhi: The Mountain Man earned him acclaim.\n\nFarah Khan\n\nWhile Main Hoon Na director, Farah, has made many appearances in Bollywood films as herself, or even in the background, her first full-fledged role was playing the female lead in Shirin Farhad Ki Toh Nikal Padi. While the film didn't do too well, the director, and her co-star, Boman Irani, made for an adorably hilarious pair.\n\nAmole Gupte\n\nThe director of Hawa Hawaai received almost as much praise for his acting chops in Kaminey and Stanley Ka Dabba, as he did for filmmaking. He was even seen in Bheja Fry 2, Singham Returns and Ek Tara. We're still in awe of how brilliantly talented he is.\n\nRead iDiva for the latest in Bollywood, fashion looks, beauty and lifestyle news."
