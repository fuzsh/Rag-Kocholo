        "text": "The Dubai Film Festival coverage continues, this time focussing on India, with reviews of Valley of Saints, Miss Lovely, Shutter, Gattu, Shobdo and Shahid.\n\nThis year, as always, the Dubai Film Festival had a fair share of offerings from the subcontinent.\n\nA special program titled ‘Celebration of Indian Cinema’ brought together some interesting films from various parts of the country which included Hansal Mehta’s gripping biopic Shahid, Kaushik Ganguly’s Shobdo, Joy Mathew’s debut feature Shutter and Tryodoshi (Quarter 1)– Buddhadeb Dasgupta’s magical big screen interpretation of some of Rabindranath Tagore’s select poems.\n\nIn the competition section, we had three major titles competing it out with the best of the Asia-Africa region – Ashim Ahluwalia’s Miss Lovely, Anand Gandhi’s Ship of Theseus and Musa Sayeed’s Valley of Saints, all first time directors. Though none won the coveted best film prize, Valley of Saints did pick up a special jury award while Aida El Kashef bagged the best actress trophy for her role in Ship of Theseus.\n\nDocumentaries from India, however, did manage to make a lasting impact at this year’s fest. Nishta Jain’s documentary on Sampat Pal Devi and her crusaders titled Gulabi Gang went on to win the Best documentary Award. The other Indian documentary in the section, Char….The No-Man’s Island, directed by Sourav Sarangi also picked up a special mention.\n\nThough impossible to cover them all, here are the reviews of the ones we did finally manage to catch at the 9th Dubai International Film Festival.\n\nVALLEY OF SAINTS (Kashmiri, 2012)\n\nCast: Gulzar Ahmed Bhat, Mohammed Afzal, Neelofar Hamid\n\nDirected by Musa Sayeed\n\nEven though Valley of Saints had been garnering great responses from all over the festival circuit, I was quite wary of what to expect from this romantic triangle involving close friends. Thankfully, director Musa Sayeed does not settle for a tried and tested formula staying completely away from the cinematic lingo and melodrama that is much adored in these parts of the world. Instead, Sayeed opts for a far more realistic and natural approach to the subject material, thereby making the film stand out from the bunch.\n\nThe film narrates a simple tale of two steadfast buddies who finds their plans to flee to Delhi thwarted by a sudden curfew imposed by the military. While the two spend the following days waiting for the curfew to be lifted, they also end up playing host to a young Kashmiri-American woman named Afisa, who has come down to the region on a research trip, studying the pollution levels of the Dal lake.\n\nTo being with, branding the film as a romantic one is doing the film a grave injustice. This is as much a film about friendship and coming of age. It is a film about the aspirations of the Kashmiri youth, forced to accept the political situation as a part of their daily lives. Above all, it functions effectively as an ecological film that keeps throwing light on how even the ‘heaven on earth’ has not been spared from pollution.\n\nThe thing that floored me was the performance from the non-actors. Both Gulzar and Afsal (also their real names) are such naturals that I was taken aback on learning that the two had absolutely no prior acting experiences. Sayeed instead taps into their natural talents, and their own life experiences to shape up the characters and screenplay. It eventually helps in bringing a certain authenticity and honesty to the film.\n\nIt is refreshing to see a movie about Kashmir that does not delve into the politics of the region. Valley of Saints aims at providing a much-needed voice to the valley and its people. And all the success that the film is receiving is sure to give young Sayeed the confidence to take on bigger and more ambitious projects.\n\nA more detailed review of the film has already been published in Mad About Moviez, which can be read here.\n\nSHUTTER (Malayalam, 2012)\n\nCast: Lal, Sreenivasan, Vinay Fort, Sajitha\n\nDirected by Joy Mathew\n\nShutter, the lone Malayalam feature that made it to this year’s DIFF narrates the misadventures of a Dubai based NRI during a trip back to his native town of Kozhikode.\n\nRasheed (Lal), who is in town to arrange his daughter’s engagement, makes the folly of picking up a sex worker (Sajitha) on a drinking night out. With no rooms available for the night, he lands up with the prostitute in the vacant commercial storeroom that he owns. Rasheed then gets his trusted errand guy, auto rickshaw driver Suran (Vinay Fort), to lock the store from outside and return in a couple of hour. However Suran fails to turn up at the designated hour, leaving Rasheed in an awkward situation of being locked up in a room with a prostitute.\n\nDirector Joy Mathew’s debut feature does provide for a few tense moments, but the film at the core is a social satire, addressing the prevalent issues that plague the modern Kerala society. The confined space and the shutter are all deftly used as an allegory to highlight the narrow mindset of people we come across in our lives. It does take the confines of the small dingy room for the conservative Rasheed to really open up his eyes to the world around him.\n\nIt would have made a much better impact had things been lot crisper and precise. For a start, one do wish that Mathew did not take an hour just to set up the characters and premise. Besides the main track, we also do have a parallel track about a struggling movie director (Sreenivasan) trying to retrieve his misplaced film script. Though, the middle portions work favourably,but Mathew’s insistence to push across the messages of trust and friendship end up making the screenplay appear predictable and contrived. A more subtle approach was definitely the need of the hour.\n\nVeterans Lal and Sreenivasan go about their tasks in the usual effective fashion, with Sajitha proving good support. However it is Vinay Fort, as the auto driver, who turns out to be the surprise package in this interesting but ultimately erratic feature.\n\nSHAHID (Hindi, 2012)\n\nCast: Raj Kumar Yadav, Prabhleen Sandhu, Mohd Zeeshan Ayyub, Vipin Sharma\n\nDirected by Hansal Mehta\n\nShahid, narrating the true story of a slain human right activist and lawyer Shahid Azmi, is a remarkably bold and gritty outing from director Hansal Mehta.\n\nMehta’s film, introduces us to a young Shahid Azmi who run away to a jihadist camp after witnessing the brutality of the heinous Mumbai riots of ‘93. Eventually, realizing that the ways of the jihads is not his calling, Shahid returns back to his home in Mumbai. But he still pays a price for it when he is picked up by the Mumbai police for suspected acts of terrorism sentencing him to a prison sentence. It is here, under the guidance of a few political prisoners, that he realizes that being a part of the system is the right way to fight for justice. He continues his graduation studies in prison and on acquittal, pursues a degree in law.\n\nAfter the initial hurdles to the start of his career, Shahid does find his groove only when he starts practice as an independent lawyer. Taking up cases for the poor and the needy, he eventually moves into the limelight when he fights for young Muslim men who are wrongly slapped with charges of terrorism. Despite the constant threats and opposition, Shahid continues his fight for justice undeterred. His inspiring career is however comes to an abrupt end when he is shot dead in his office, by unidentified assailants in 2010.\n\nLike Paan Singh Tomar, Shahid too serves as a shameful reminder of the struggles the minorities and the weak have to undertake to attain equality and basic constitutional rights in the country. While the former biopic showed us a man forced to go against the law, this one is about one who joins the system in his quest for justice.\n\nThe film is obviously not without flaws. The budget constraints do show up every now and then. We really don’t see much visual references in capturing the period over which the film spans. In fact, we hardly see any changes in the physical attributes of the title character over the course of the film. Yet, these are flaws that can be overlooked to an extent, because Shahid is that rare hard hitting biopic made with a lot of heart. It is evident in the performances too.\n\nRaj Kumar Yadav’s superlative performance goes a long way to enhance the film. It was justified of Mehta to opt for a fresh face instead of settling for an established actor which would have relegated the character. Yadav brings those dimensions of naiveté and sincerity which would have been seriously lacking otherwise.\n\nYadav’s brilliant effort is admirably supported by Prabhaleen Sandhu (Shahid’s wife Mariam) and Mohd Zeeshan Ayyub (Shahid’s older brother). Vipin Sharma also pitches in with a delightful performance to go along with the spirited cameos from Kay Kay Menon and Tigmanshu Dhulia.\n\nKudos to Mehta and team for striving to tell the story of this unlikely hero, that too, within a more commercial template. This is indeed a voice that deserves to be heard, not just in the confines of the periphery of film fests but by a much larger audience. With the producers Anurag Kashyap Films and Bohra Bros Films eyeing a possible March 2013 release date, Shahid should hopefully get the attention it deserves.\n\nMISS LOVELY (Hindi, 2012)\n\nCast: Nawazuddin Siddique, , Anil George, Niharika Singh, Zeena Bhatia\n\nDirected by Ashim Ahluwalia\n\nMiss Lovely, an offbeat yet daring effort from director Ashim Ahluwalia, is foremost an attempt to give life and blood to the players that functions within the murky, illicit world of the C-grade film business. This scorned industry, churning out horror-porn flicks at shoe string budgets, has been the bread and butter for many misfits who failed to make it to the bigger glossier world of Bollywood. Yet despite the varying degrees of products, their aspirations and insecurities do have a common ring to it.\n\nDirtier than ‘The Dirty Picture’, Miss Lovely is a tale set in the 1980s, at a time when the market for these kinds of horror-porn movies was at its peak. Ahluwalia goes on to even pluck a storyline straight from that era about ‘warring brothers’ to slip the viewer right into familiar territory. While Vicky Duggal, (Anil George) is the ambitious, scrupulous older brother who is into producing C-grade film, Sonu (Nawazuddin Siddique) is the reserved and naïve younger one who is certain that he is in the wrong line of work, even though he goes about assisting his brother, dutifully.\n\nWhat Sonu really would like to do is make ‘Miss Lovely’ – a romantic film which is anything like what his brother makes. And when he meets a pretty young wannabe actress named Pinky (Niharika Singh), Sonu is pretty certain that he has found his ‘Miss Lovely’. However, just as Sonu believes he has it all figured out, life decides to hand him down a different script.\n\nThis is a project that evolved into a feature film when Ahluwalia realized that he would never be able to make a documentary about this industry with no one willing to come before the camera. So while Ahluwalia throws in all the first hand experiences and stories he stumbled upon into the narrative, the story line is more or less an afterthought, hoping it serves as a good binder. Unfortunately this factor clearly shows up on the screen. What, therefore, we have is a wayward screenplay that seems to have no real course to trail.\n\nThe film does have its moments with the initial half promising us a fascinating exploration of the dark, shady world. However the novelty aspect wears off pretty quick and what we are left to deal with is a half-baked script, doused in some haphazard editing and equally irking frames. After a fine job early on with its atmospheric treatment, the wheels come off in the second, with things rolling down pretty much like your mainstream standard fare, just the kind it tried to distinguish itself from at the very onset.\n\nDespite all the sleaze on offer, it is the marvelous Nawazuddin who ultimately seizes your attention. It has truly been the year of this man, shining through in everything he did. This one also proves to be no exception with Siddique putting in an assured and subtle act keeping the audiences engaged even as they witness the screenplay taking a regrettable nosedive.\n\nSHOBDO (Sound) (Bengali, 2012)\n\nCast: Ritwik Chakraborty, Srijit Mukherjee, Raima Sen, Churni Ganguly, Victor Banerjee\n\nDirected by Kaushik Ganguly\n\nAfter last year’s Laptop, director Kaushik Ganguly returns to DIFF 2012 with his latest work, Shobdo (Sound), a movie which he terms as ‘a tribute to the unsung heroes’ of film making.\n\nIn Shobdo, Tarak (Ritwik) is a Foley artist who is extremely passionate about his work, spending most of his days either working away in the studio room or thinking up ways on how to recreate the various sounds he hears. However the man is so involved in his job that he begins to develop a strange condition – he pays attention to only the ambient sounds. As a result, his ears are sharp enough to observe the nuances and complexities of the various sounds around him, but conveniently blank out voices of people around. His psychiatrist (Churni Ganguly) and his wife (Raima Sen) begin to get extremely worried about the situation but Tarak continues to remain on a denial mode.\n\nAt a time when the sync sound is gaining popularity in the Indian industry, this is a timely venture that pays homage to the art of Foley. Ritwik Chakraborty comes up with a fine performance in the lead role of the artist consumed by the passion for his art. Decent support comes in the form of the supporting cast that includes Raima Sen, Victor Banerjee and Churni Ganguly.\n\nHowever while focusing on the aspect of sound design and Foley techniques, Ganguly seem to have forgotten another vital department of film making – the editing. Even at 100 minutes, the film seems to be stretched. A lot of the first hour is spent with the psychiatrist repeatedly discussing and expounding us with the peculiar condition of the protagonist until, we too, stop registering the voices and begin to restrict our attention to the ambience. The film picks up a beat when the narrative does switch back the focus from the problem to Tarak’s character.\n\nGATTU (Hindi)\n\nCast: Mohammad Samad, Naresh Kumar\n\nDirected by Rajan Khosa\n\nRajan Khosa’s Gattu is undoubtedly a charmer of a film that can win the hearts of both the young ones and the adults, alike.\n\nTen year old Gattu is an orphan kid living with his ‘uncle’, doing odd jobs at the scrap shop. Despite the conditions that he lives in, the spunky street smart kid has absolutely no complaints, fibbing his way through without a flinch. But when he is not busy working, the boy finds immense pleasure in kite flying. And what would give him more joy is if he could defeat the indestructible ‘Kali’ – a black kite that many have unsuccessfully tried to overcome. Gattu is determined to pin down ‘Kali’ at any cost, even if it means that he has to sneak into a school posing as a student, all for the sake of having access to a better rooftop.\n\nDirector Khosa has done a marvelous job with the script. He pitches the right mood, never for once resorting to cliché melodramas to get things moving. Nor does he succumb to stretching the film beyond necessary. Sure it does get a little exaggerated towards the end, but then what is a children’s film without a bit of that? Kohsa ensures that the issues of illiteracy and child labour are well addressed without going all preachy on us.\n\nMohammed Samad as Gattu is a great find. He makes the title character an endearing personality. The lad ends up carrying the entire movie on his shoulders. Of course it helps that his characterization is also charmingly novel. He is far from the routine ‘perfect orphan boy’. Yet, you never hold any of the flaws against him and instead only proceed to cheer the indomitable spirit of young Gattu. The eleven year old is already going places, with an Anurag Kashyap production next on his list, where he will be sharing screen space with none other than Nawazuddin Siddique.\n\nSandesh Shandilya also warrants a mention for the wonderful background score."
