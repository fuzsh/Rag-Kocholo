        "text": "Irrfan Khan was one of the best actors that the entertainment industry had. He was an extraordinary performer whose work has left a lasting mark on cinema. With his remarkable talent and versatility, he captivated audiences worldwide. His nuanced portrayals in films like Qarib Qarib Singlle, Talvar, Hindi Medium and Maqbool showcased his immense skill and depth as an actor.\n\nToday, as we remember the late actor on his death anniversary, let’s go over the list of films that he’s done with some of the best directors worldwide.\n\nTalvar- Meghna Gulzar\n\nHaider- Vishal Bhardwaj\n\nPiku- Shoojit Sircar\n\nLife in a…. Metro- Anurag Basu\n\nThe Amazing Spider-Man- Marc Webb\n\nPaan Singh Tomar-Tigmanshu Dhulia\n\nSlumdog Millionaire- Danny Boyle\n\nThe Namesake- Mira Nair\n\nTalvar- Meghna Gulzar\n\nTalvar is a gripping film directed by one of Bollywood’s most talented writers and director, Meghna Gulzar. The film is based on the infamous Noida double murder case of 2008. Irrfan Khan delivered a stellar performance as investigating officer Ashwin Kumar, bringing depth and sensitivity to the character. It’s easy to say that this is one of Irrfan’s best performances because the film really brought out different layers to him as an actor because you could feel his character’s anxiety and obsessiveness with the case, while sitting in the audience. Meghna Gulzar has also directed critically acclaimed films like Raazi and Sam Bahadur.\n\nHaider- Vishal Bhardwaj\n\nThis film is directed by Vishal Bhardwaj who is known for his masterful storytelling and unique cinematic style. In the film, Irrfan portrayed the enigmatic Roohdar, a character who guides Haider on his journey of revenge and self-discovery in war-torn Kashmir. Even though the part was brief, it was a delight to watch him deliver poetic dialogues and establish chemistry with each character in the film. Vishal Bhardwaj is known for delivering cinematic masterpieces such Omkara, Maqbool and Maachis.\n\nPiku- Shoojit Sircar\n\nThis heartwarming comedy-drama is directed by Shoojit Sircar who is known for his realistic portrayal of characters and everyday life situations. In the film, Irrfan Khan plays the role of Rana Chaudhary, a taxi company owner who is drawn into the quirky dynamics of Piku and her father. This character is also one Irrfan’s most loved one because of how beautifully he established a friendly and romantic relationship with Deepika Padukone’s character. Their unexpected pairing was widely appreciated by audiences. Shoojit Sircar is a National Award winning director has also directed films like Sardar Udham Singh and Pink.\n\nLife in a…. Metro- Anurag Basu\n\nIrrfan, who was widely known for playing serious characters, surprised the audience by essaying this memorable role of Monty who is a shy and introverted man who falls in love with a married woman. It is one of those few films that showcased him as a softer and romantic character. The film is directed by Anurag Basu who is known for his comedic yet emotional storytelling. Anurag Basu has directed highly appreciated films like Barfi and Kites.\n\nThe Amazing Spider-Man- Marc Webb\n\nIn this film Irrfan portrayed the role of Dr. Ratha who is involved in the Oscorp corporation's research projects.He is the immediate superior to Dr Curt Connors who later turns into the Lizard, the film's villain. This film not only brought him more recognition in Hollywood but gave us Bollywood fans a chill down our spines because Irrfan so convincingly played an evil role. The film is directed by Marc Webb who is known for both action as well as slow, feel-good films such as 500 Days of Summer and The Only Living Boy in New York.\n\nPaan Singh Tomar-Tigmanshu Dhulia\n\nIrrfan Khan delivered a powerhouse performance in the biographical film directed by Tigmanshu Dhulia. In one half of the film, Irrfan smoothly essayed the role of the athlete who won a gold medal in Indian National Games seven times in a row and in the other half, he completely transformed himself into a leader of dacoits who nobody wants to be involved with. Tigmanshu Dhulia's filmmaking style is known for its realism and intensity. Irrfan has also collaborated with Tigmanshu Dhulia for famous films like Haasil which played a huge role in carving him as an actor and making a name for himself.\n\nSlumdog Millionaire- Danny Boyle\n\nThis oscar winning film is directed by Danny Boyle. Danny Boyle is himself an Academy Award winner and is known for films like 127 Hours, 28 Days Later and Trainspotting. In Slumdog Millionaire, Irrfan played the convincing role of a police inspector. Even though his part was small, he made a mark for himself through his unnoticeable screen presence. His body language and strong dialogue delivery did not make him look any less than a real life Indian cop.\n\nThe Namesake- Mira Nair\n\nTo save the best for the last, Irrfan Khan's performance in The Namesake was deeply nuanced and resonant as he perfectly managed to portray the complexities of having an immigrant identity with subtlety and depth. This Mira Nair directorial caused the spark for Irrfan’s international fame. Mira Nair has directed some appreciated work like Salaam Bombay! and Monsoon Wedding."
