        "text": "Kunal Kapoor was slightly ashamed when he read the script for Raag Desh. “ I wasn’t very familiar with the event,” says the genial actor who stars in Tigmanshu Dhulia’s latest directorial venture. “There’s [only] a fleeting mention of it in school history textbooks.” The film, which released yesterday, chronicles the court-martial of Indian National Army (INA) officers Prem Sahgal, Gurbaksh Singh Dhillon and Shah Nawaz Khan. The trials garnered immense public outcry, making them instrumental in India’s freedom struggle. Kapoor wonders, though, why a film on the subject hasn’t been made earlier. “It’s a story that was made for the big screen,” he says.\n\nPatriotism and patronisation\n\nAt the time, the Congress and the Muslim League joined forces to protest the trials, and the event saw widespread public support for the INA officers. “After this, there were around three to four lakh people who would come to see them in every city because they were that popular,” shares Kapoor. The actor, who portrays Shah Nawaz Khan, believes patriotism has been reduced to social media posts, vigilantism or an India-Pakistan match. “It’s not about putting down somebody else who has an opinion, but about fighting for the ideologies that the country was built upon,” he asserts. To prepare for his role, Kapoor had to perfect a combination of Punjabi and Urdu when he spoke. “And I worked so hard on it that eventually my inner monologue was in Shah Nawaz’s voice,” he laughs.\n\nRaag Desh isn’t the first time Kapoor worked in a film that looks at India’s freedom struggle. He co-starred in the widely successful Rang De Basanti in 2006. The actor played Aslam Khan, and the freedom fighter, Ashfaqulla Khan, known for his involvement in the Kakori train robbery of 1925. “When success comes easily, some choices you make are not deeply personal,” he shares, about the film’s reception. That’s how he chose to be Raghuvendra, one of the protagonist’s love interests in Gauri Shinde’s Dear Zindagi (2016). “There were some films that didn’t work out in between, so I sat back and reflected on why I became an actor in the first place. Ever since then, the choices have really paid off.”\n\nIt was this deep consideration that attracted Kapoor to Raag Desh’s script. “Shah Nawaz Khan came from an affluent family and all his relatives were in the British Indian Army,” shares the actor adding that his character joined the INA knowing that a time might come where he would have had to fight the British Indian Army and maybe kill members of his family. “He was willing to do that because the cause was bigger than the individual,” says Kapoor.\n\nTrigger-happy decisions\n\nYet another reason to be part of Dhulia’s film was to work with the director himself. “It was the quickest that I’ve said yes to a film. Tigmanshu is not only a brilliant director and writer, but he’s also a really good actor,” says Kapoor talking about the filmmaker’s roles in Hansal Mehta’s Shahid (2013) as lawyer Maqbool Memon; and in Anurag Kashyap’s Gangs of Wasseypur (2012) films as Ramadhir Singh. “He understands the mindset of other actors which is why he is able to bring out good work from them,” says the actor adding that shooting for the film wasn’t easy, given that the Uri surgical strikes and demonetisation occurred at the same time. “But I never saw him stressed or upset.”\n\nThe actor will soon be seen as Chandu Chekavar in National Award-winning director Jayaraj’s upcoming Veeram, an adaptation of William Shakespeare’s Macbeth; and in Reema Kagti’s Gold based on India’s first Olympic medal after Independence in 1948. He will also star in débutante director Vandana Kataria’s The Noblemen , as a drama teacher teaching Shakespeare. “This past year I think I’ve done more interesting work than I think I’ve done in my entire career,” he laughs. “And a lot of directors I’ve worked with feel that there’s only so much of me that they’ve explored. And I find that dynamic really interesting.”\n\nIn addition to his list of upcoming films, the actor is looking forward to releasing a film based on his own script. Kapoor started writing when he was 12 years old and has recently dedicated time to turn them into screenplays. One of these is about the relationship between a father and son. “That screenplay is ready now and will hopefully go into production soon,” he concludes with smile."
