        "text": "2013 has been a good year for Bollywood. With blockbuster films like Raanjhanaa, Bhaag Milkha Bhaag, Chennai Express and Grand Masti, film makers and producers are smiling their way to the bank.\n\nBut it’s not over. Yet. Come November and the Box Office will see five films that will compete with each other to break records and set new ones. It will be big business for Bollywood.\n\nFive major films that will be releasing: Krrish3, Ram Leela, Gori Tere Pyaar Mein, Singh Saab The Great and Bullett Raja.\n\nContinue reading →\n\nSanki, Yaaron Ka Yaar, Dil Phenq Aashiq! That pretty much sums up Raja Misra a.k.a our very own Bullett Raja, Saif Ali Khan. Tigmanshu Dhulia’s new small town hero packs a solid punch and makes a lasting impression only to heat up things with his sizzling action-romantic act! Jab hum aayenge toh garmi thodi badh jayegi!\n\nBullett Raja’s racy and action-packed first trailer stylishly heats up things and expectations of yet another massy entertainer. But warn you, this one is purely in Tigmanshu Dhulia’s style. Small town, Guns, Gangsters, Gaalis and lots of fast –paced action.\n\nContinue reading →\n\nSaif Ali Khan belongs to that rare breed of stars who have been able to make it big as a solo hero, even after essaying supporting/parallel roles in many super hit films. His ‘jodi’ with top stars like Akshay Kumar, Shah Rukh Khan and Aamir Khan was highly popular and together they delivered some blockbuster hits. Saif’s decision to go solo was frowned upon by many but the ‘Nawab’ proved his mettle and showed that he is capable of carrying a film on his own shoulders.\n\nHUM TUM marked Saif’s first major solo success and was followed by PARINEETA & SALAAM NAMASTE, announcing that Saif Ali Khan had arrived as a solo lead. However, that prestigious 100 crore club, that is now a benchmark of success for all top stars is eluding Saif. His RACE 2 (although it co-starred John Abraham) could not cross the 100 crore mark and folded up netting 93-94 crore. And so all eyes are now on his upcoming venture, the Tigmanshu Dhulia directed BULLETT RAJA.\n\nContinue reading →"
