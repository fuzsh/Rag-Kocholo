Katrina says a lot of things start with mindset change and \"we need to think what we are doing for women around us\". \"Recently, I've become more aware of this, even subconsciously, do we really support our contemporaries- in whatever industry you're in?

The \"Tiger Zinda Hai\" actor says she tries to do whatever she can within her capacity. \"Am I lifting up the women around me, am I doing what I can to support, encourage or to help them grow?

In the film, Boyega will be seen playing the role of Jake Pentecost, son of Stacker Pentecost but the actor also served as an on-set producer on the Sci-fi. So when director Steven S DeKnight and the film's producers approached him, the actor saw an opportunity. In my previous films, I was just an actor. Now I'd be a producer as well, and I loved the challenge of having to live up to that form of leadership, co-producing alongside a studio that I admire, acting in a fantastic role, and working with Stevensomeone I've wanted to work with after his incredible work on Spartacus and Daredevil,\" Boyega said in a statement. \"Being a producer was interesting because any decision I helped make outside the character affected the role.
