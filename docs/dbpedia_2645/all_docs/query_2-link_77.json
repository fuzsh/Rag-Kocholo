We have been listening to you and we have made the app experience more immersive, delightful, and easier to use.\n\nImmersive visuals with a focus on the worldâs best stories\n\nDecide what to watch with more info and an easier way to navigate episodes\n\nWatch immersively and change episodes without leaving the video player\n\nManage everything about you in âMy Spaceâ\n\nDedicated tab for you to search faster\n\nPraneetkaur ,\n\nNot user friendly\n\nThe content they have is good but how the new updates on app have disrupted it the entire ott experience is worst. Iâd also written to the hotstar team to bring back the watchlist option which was on the previous version on app that allows a user to add individual episodes to the watchlist. That was very simple and easier way to navigate through any particular episode. But after the new update that came in March, this feature has been disabled. You can now only add the entire series of any show to the watchlist but not particular episodes. With every update on the app in apple store, the team very conveniently write that âwe are listening to youâ¦â are you guys actually listening? These apps are made to give us entertainment, we are charged for the quality of app, content. App updates are made to fix bugs, issues ,not to distrupt the user experience, which you guys have been doing since almost 6 months. And doing a fab job in spoiling the experience ðð». All the more worst experience is while navigating through episodes, the entire list just doesnât open. Please explain how do you move forward or backwards to pick up from where we left the series? Your team has all the screenshots of the issues I have addressed, please do your homework and then come back with a resolution, âliterallyâ. High time you should genuinely start listening to your users!\n\nDeveloper Response ,\n\nHi! Thank you for being honest with us! Please share your feedback here: scroll a couple of times on the home page of the app & click on the \"Share Feedback\" option & share your detailed feedback along with your number. This will help us improve."
