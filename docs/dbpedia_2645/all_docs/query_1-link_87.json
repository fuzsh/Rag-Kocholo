Scarred by unpleasant memories, she prefers to travel on New Year's Eve.\n\nAnonymity could be comforting and such a situation could lead to an almost romance as two strangers go through the eight stages of a relationship – The Icebreaker, The Honeymoon, The Reality Check, The Break-up, The Patch-up, The Confiding, The Great Friendship, The Killing Confusion - all over one phone conversation.\n\nAs they get closer to each other over the phone, they find themselves miles apart geographically when the film ends and it is time for her to board her flight. Will they just let it be a night they would cherish for the rest of their lives or do they want more?\n\nGood Night | Good Morning, starring Manu Narayan (Bombay Dreams, The Love Guru, Quarter Life Crisis) and Seema Rahmani (Loins of Punjab, Sins and Missed Call) also features New York based theatre actor Vasanth Santosham (Bhopal: A Prayer for Rain), screenwriter and film critic Raja Sen and adman Abhishek D Shah.\n\nShot in black and white as a tribute to the era of talkies of the fifties, the film set to a jazzy score by musicians from UK (Jazz composer Ray Guntrip and singer Tina May collaborated for the song ‘Out of the Blue), the US (Manu Narayan and his creative partner Radovan scored two songs for the film – All That’s Beautiful Must Die and Fire while Gregory Generet provided his versions of two popular jazz standards – Once You’ve Been In Love and Moon Dance) and India (Sudeep and Jerry came up with a new live version of Strangers in the Night) was met with rave reviews from leading film critics.\n\nThe film was released under the PVR Director’s Rare banner on January 20, 2012.\n\nFestivals & Screenings\n\nMumbai Film Festival (MAMI), Mumbai 2010 World Premiere\n\nSouth Asian Intl Film Festival, New York, 2010 Intl Premiere\n\nGoa Film Alliance-IFFI, Goa, 2010 Spl Screening\n\nChennai Intl Film Festival, Chennai, 2010 Official Selection\n\nHabitat Film Festival, New Delhi, 2011 Official Selection\n\nTransilvania Intl Film Festival, Cluj, 2011 Official Selection, 3.97/5 Audience Barometer\n\nInternational Film Festival, Delhi, 2011 Official Selection\n\nNoordelijk Film Festival, Netherlands, 2011 Official Selection, 7.11/10 Audience Barometer\n\nMumbai Film Mart, Mumbai 2011, Market Screening\n\nFilm Bazaar, IFFI-Goa, 2011, Market Screening\n\nSaarang Film Festival, IIT-Madras, 2012, Official Selection, 7.7/10 Audience Barometer\n\nTheatrical Release, January 20, 2012 through PVR\n\nMumbai\n\nDelhi\n\nGurgaon\n\nAhmedabad\n\nBangalore\n\nChennai\n\nHyderabad (January 27)\n\n* * * * *\n\nMore information: IMDB | Facebook | Youtube | Wikipedia | Website\n\nHow do you evaluate an incomplete painting?\n\nOr half a story?\n\nIt seems unfair but this is a situation the makers of Gangs of Wasseypur have forced on us by making us pay to watch what’s clearly an incomplete story. Yes, we can always appreciate individual moments and scenes but not all of us are die-hard Kashyap fans. Yet.\n\nI wish it was as simple as saying that Gangs of Wasseypur 1 is half-empty or half-full of the plot but at this point, it looks like it holds no water.\n\nGood filmmaking, or shot-taking, doesn’t always translate to good storytelling. While every frame here is so passionately put together (cinematography by Rajeev Ravi and edited by Shweta Venkat Mathew), supremely performed with brilliantly conceived moments of quirk and humour, Part 1 just doesn’t come together as a cohesive story.\n\nGangs Of Wasseypur is a trip, no doubt. A trip to nowhere, one most enjoyed if you are an Anurag Kashyap fan. You buy a ticket to Wasseypur, you meet colourful, gun-toting, expletive-spewing, sex maniacs on the way and share a couple of laughs, amused by their choice of language till the buffoonery gets repetitive. After a long, bumpy ride through every other busy bylane close to where you boarded from, the driver leaves you stranded on a highway with a note: “Next bus to Wasseypur in three months.”\n\nYou paid to watch revenge. What you get is a guy doing everything else except that. Unfortunately, most of us still consume films as stories and as far as stories go, Wasseypur Part 1 is a non-starter, a deceitful film that delivers none of the promise of that revenge advertised in big block letters: Keh ke loonga. Fine, but take already. The only thing it takes is your ticket money. All talk, no walk.\n\nIt’s all backdrop, backdrop, backdrop spelt out all through… and even that backdrop of coal mining is not convincing, as the film pretends to be a documentary on the subject with archival footage that does nothing to the narrative except prolong it with endless voiceover.\n\nVoiceover here isn’t used to help you settle in, it’s the thread and glue that holds the loosely arranged pieces together, a character who returns to keep us in the loop, as bursts of superimposed text to illustrate timelines and character names are slapped on the screen, every few minutes. Show, tell and text on top! (This evening, the team has also released a family tree for those still confused about who’s who in the film)\n\nWhile the two-part Kill Bill sets up the context and leaves two out of the five people in the list dead, assuring you are halfway home, Gangs of Wasseypur Part 1 cancels out everything that happens with its climactic moment, not just taking the hero back to square one but changing its mind about who the hero is.\n\nSo we just watched a 160 minute long prologue?\n\nEven an out of form Ram Gopal Varma showed some focus in his indulgent, pulpy two-part Rakta Charitra. Part 1: One guy rises to power leaving the other guy who has lost his whole family understandably thirsting for revenge in Part 2.\n\nHere, we don’t even understand why revenge is that important for the guy who has sworn to keep his head shaved till he has ruined his enemy.\n\nIf you want us to connect or understand the avenger’s motivation, he must have some quality that makes us root for him or at least some injustice meted out to him. But his father was a scheming scoundrel too. Sardar Khan has no redeeming quality except that it is portrayed by a fantastic Manoj Bajpayee.\n\nThe protagonist’s full time occupation is being a sex maniac, revenge is a part time thing he would do, like, over a few decades when he’s not getting his women pregnant. His misadventures with the two women in the film make for delightful vignettes but there’s little else powering this film except the entry of the endearingly filmi Faisal Khan (Nawazuddin) towards the end.\n\nThe trailer of Part 2 is one of the slickest ever you will see this year and going by the fun promised, you can blindly book your tickets to watch the Nawazuddin Siddiqui show. Richa Chaddha’s Nagma is guaranteed to win her fans, Reema Sen looks every bit the seductress and Huma Qureshi’s charm and chemistry with Nawazuddin sparkles.\n\nPiyush Mishra makes for a wicked cheating Consigliori, Jaideep Alhawat is dispensed off early on as the man whose death triggers off this epic, Jameel Khan amuses us playing the foil to Bajpayee, while Pankaj Tripathi makes for a menacing baddie we want to see more of.\n\nLike the villain of the piece Ramadhir Singh (Tigmanshu Dhulia lends this character so much charisma and intensity) demonstrates, coal becomes heavier when soaked in water, but there’s only so much you can adulterate it with.\n\nHere, coal is substituted with coolth. We are so cool that in our town, we call the women, Womaniya (Hats off to music director Sneha Khanwalkar for the soundtrack that provides some respite). We are so cool that we use gorgeous-looking typeface guaranteed to make you drool even if it wears a vibe different from the rustic environs of the film. We are so cool that we would make the opening credits of ‘Kyonki Saas Bhi Kabhi Bahu Thi’ look like a joke. We are so cool we have characters called Definite, Perpendicular and Tangent in Part 2 of Gangs of Wasseypur because honestly, we got tired of keeping count of the Khans and Qureshis in the film!\n\nAll that coolth and pop realism may do well with the die-hard Kashyap cult but for the rest of us who paid to watch a bloody saga of revenge, it seems like a long wait at the circus.\n\nGenre: Gangster\n\nDirector: Anurag Kashyap\n\nCast: Manoj Bajpayee, Nawazuddin Siddiqui, Richa Chaddha, Reema Sen, Huma\n\nQureshi, Jameel Khan, Tigmanshu Dhulia, Pankaj Tripathi, Jaideep Alhawat\n\nStoryline: A man must avenge the death of his father, but he whiles away his time making babies.\n\nBottomline: Epic fail. Probably works a lot better when seen back to back.\n\nA shorter version of this originally appeared here."
