        "text": "Arshad Warsi and Scam 1992 star Pratik Gandhi have been roped in to play lead roles in filmmaker Tigmanshu Dhulia's next movie Yash.\n\nProduced by Piiyush Singh, Abhayanand Singh, Ashwini Chaudhary and Miten Shah, the film marks the first on screen collaboration of Warsi and Gandhi. Singh, COO, Golden Ratio Films, said, their aim is to make films that are content driven.\n\n\"Content in movies has to be compelling and different to keep up with the changing tastes and expectations of the audience. But Yash is beyond all of that. It is an attempt by us to narrate a realistic story that will take the audience by surprise,\" said the producer."
