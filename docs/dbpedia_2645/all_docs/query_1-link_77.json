        "text": "Biographies are on the rise in Bollywood as more and more filmmakers are investing in stories. They say fact is often stranger than fiction and looking at our list, that indeed seems to be true. Sarbjit, for instance, is about a man who spent 22 years in prison on a false charge while Manjhi: The Mountain Man is all about a man who carved a path through a mountain all by himself. Neerja is about a young stewardess who went above and beyond the call of duty in a hijack situation, while Sanju brought Sanjay Dutt’s exciting life to celluloid. Presenting a list of the best biopics movies from this decade for your viewing pleasure this lockdown.\n\n1. Shahid (2012)\n\n2. Aligarh (2015)\n\n3. Manjhi: The Mountain Man (2015)\n\n4. Neerja (2016)\n\n5. Sarbjit (2016)\n\n6. Manto (2018)\n\n7. Sanju (2018)\n\n8. Pad Man (2018)\n\n9. Thackeray (2019)\n\n10. The Accidental Prime Minister (2019)\n\n11. Super 30 (2019)\n\n1. Shahid (2012)\n\nDirector: Hansal Mehta\n\nCast: Rajkummar Rao, Tigmanshu Dhulia, Kay Kay Menon, Prabhleen Sandhu\n\nShahid is based on the life of lawyer and human rights activist Shahid Azmi, who was assassinated in 2010. The cases handled by him were almost exclusively of defending those accused of terrorism. Shahid (Rajkummar Rao) is troubled by the1992 Mumbai riots and travels to Kashmir to become a terrorist. Not liking what he saw there, he soon returns. He’s jailed by the police under Terrorist and Disruptive Activities (Prevention) Act, for plotting against the state and spends seven years in Tihar Jail. There, he completes his education. By the time he was discharged, he had gained a degree in law. He starts working under Maqbool Memon (Tigmanshu Dhulia) -- the character based on civil rights lawyer Majeed Memon but soon starts his own practice. He works mostly on pro bono cases in tandem with NGOs. He only defends people accused of terrorism and starts getting calls threatening his life. While defending Faheem Ansari in the 2008 Mumbai attacks case, he is shot by two gunmen and dies on the spot. In the end, Ansari is shown to be acquitted of all charges by the Supreme Court of India. It was a hard-hitting film and was highly praised by the critics. Rajkummar’s performance also came in for a lot of praise.\n\n2. Aligarh (2015)\n\nDirector: Hansal Mehra\n\nCast: Manoj Bajpayee, Rajkummar Rao\n\nHomosexuality is still a taboo subject in India. Aligarh is based on the true story of Ramchandra Siras, a professor of Marathi and the head of the Classical Modern Indian Languages Faculty at Aligarh Muslim University, who was suspended from his position as he allegedly had homosexual tendencies. Manoj Bajpayee portrays Siras with all his complexities. Siras thinks he’s a victim of campus politics. He feels goons were sent to film his homosexual encounter with a rickshaw puller because people were jealous of his position. He refuses to fully come out as gay and is shown to be unable to handle himself when the gay community reaches out to him. He’s drunk most of the time after the incident and can’t understand why his world has turned upside down. He doesn’t want to be a champion of gay rights either. The film raises questions about the invasion of privacy. It also makes us ponder whether sexual orientation is the only yardstick with which we must judge people. While Manoj Bajpayee was fabulous, Rajkummar Rao was equally good as the journalist who tries to draw the professor out of his self-imposed shell.\n\n3. Manjhi: The Mountain Man (2015)\n\nDirector: Ketan Mehta\n\nCast: Nawazuddin Siddiqui, Radhika Apte\n\nIt’s a film based on the life of Dashrath Manjhi. Manjhi, widely known as the ‘Mountain Man’. Manjhi was a poor labourer in Gehlaur village, near Gaya in Bihar, India, who carved a 25 feet deep, 30 feet wide and 360 feet long path through a hill using only a hammer and chisel, working tirelessly for close to 22 years at a stretch. Dashrath Manjhi (Nawazuddin Siddiqui) lives in a small village near Gaya, Bihar, with his wife Phaguniya Devi (Radhika Apte) and his son. There’s a rocky mountain near his village that people either had to climb or travel round to gain access to medical care at the nearest town Wazirganj. One day Manjhi's pregnant wife falls down while trying to cross the mountain and eventually dies giving birth to a girl. Saddened by her loss and enraged by grief, Manjhi decides to teach the mountain a lesson and for 22 years struggles to carve a path through it. He’s made much fun of by the other villagers but doesn’t give up the project. His success proves that mountains indeed can be moved if you have the required faith. The chemistry between Nawazuddin Siddiqui and Radhika Apte is excellent. Nawazuddin shines both as a young husband and as a bitter old man who struggles against all odds to fulfil his vow. Ironically, after the real Manjhi’s death in 2010, the government finally built a concrete road to their village.\n\n4. Neerja (2016)\n\nDirector: Ram Madhvani\n\nCast: Sonam Kapoor, Shabana Azmi, Yogendra Tiku, Shekhar Ravjiani\n\nNeerja Bhanot was the Senior Flight Purser on Pan Am Flight 73 flying from Bombay to the United States, which was hijacked by four armed men on 5 September 1986 at Karachi airport in Pakistan. The aircraft was carrying 380 passengers and 13 crew members. The terrorists wanted to fly to Cyprus with the goal of freeing Palestinian prisoners in Cyprus. Bhanot was able to alert the cockpit crew as soon as the hijackers boarded the plane and the pilots escaped. She also helped in hiding the passports of the American passengers. Later, she opened an emergence hatch and was helping passengers escape when she was shot dead by the terrorists. She became the youngest recipient of the Ashok Chakra Award, India's most prestigious gallantry award for bravery shown during peacetime. Sonam essays the titular role in the film, which is shot from her perspective. In between the tension-filled moments, we see glimpses of her life before the ill-fated flight took off, as she reminisces about her happy childhood, her adolescence and her fledgeling romance with a young man. Sonam gave a commendable performance as the young braveheart bent on doing her duty even at the cost of her own life. Shabana Azmi too won accolades for her deft portrayal of Neerja’s mother.\n\n5. Sarbjit (2016)\n\nDirector: Omung Kumar\n\nCast: Aishwarya Rai Bachchan, Randeep Hooda, Richa Chadha, Darshan Kumar\n\nSarbjit Singh was born in Bhikhiwind, located along the Indo-Pakistani border in the Tarn Taran district of Punjab. He was caught by Pakistani rangers near Kasur and claimed he had crossed over the border in an inebriated state. The Pakistani police initially charged him for trespassing but later accused him of being an Indian terrorist. He spent 22 years in jail, from 1991 till his death in 2013. Various mercy petitions were filed on his behalf but all got rejected. Even the intervention of the Government of India wasn’t enough to get him freed. He was killed by prison inmates, some say as retaliation towards the hanging of Afzal Guru. The film is told from the viewpoint of Sarbjit’s sister Dalbir Kaur, played by Aishwarya Rai Bachchan. Randeep Hooda, who essayed the titular role, lost 18 kgs to look like someone who has been in prison for 22 years. The film opened to good critical acclaim and both Aishwarya and Randeep were praised for their performances.\n\n6. Manto (2018)\n\nDirector: Nandita Das\n\nCast: Nawazuddin Siddiqui, Rasika Dugal, Tahir Raj Bhasin, Inaamulhaq\n\nManto is a hard-hitting biopic of one of our most seminal writers. Saadat Hasan Manto belonged to two worlds. One was inhabited by the progressive writers like Ismat Chughtai, her husband Shahid Lateef, who was both a writer and a filmmaker, Krishan Chander, Rajinder Singh Bedi and others of their ilk. But apart from this fascinating world full of bright lights, bright ideas and bright faces, he also lived in a much darker world inhabited by prostitutes and lowlifes. Manto was also a creature of Bombay. While he was happy with India's Independence, the Partition was like a blow to his soul and he never really recovered from it. Though he was forced to migrate to Lahore, his soul never really left Bombay. This alienation from the city which was his Muse led to severe emotional turmoil. Writer/ Director Nandita Das has written a brilliant script depicting the rise and fall of a genius mind. Reality and imagination get juxtaposed as instances from Manto’s life get fused with sequences from some of his famous stories. Nawazuddin captures outdid himself playing Manto. His quicksilver expressions say more about the man than the chaste Urdu he spouts.\n\n7. Sanju (2018)\n\nDirector: Rajkumar Hirani\n\nCast: Ranbir Kapoor, Paresh Rawal, Manisha Koirala, Vicky Kaushal, Anushka Sharma, Jim Sarbh, Sonam Kapoor, Dia Mirza\n\nIt was a cracking take on the life of Sanjay Dutt, one of our most controversial film stars and Rajkumar Hirani has made every episode seem as real as it could get. But the treatment is such that you don’t end up feeling like you’ve watched a news documentary. Humour is both Hirani’s sword and shield and he has used it well. You begin smiling when the first scene, involving Sanju’s reading of his biography, begins. And you keep laughing till the end credits roll. It’s a story of a troubled young man fighting his demons and carving for himself a path towards redemption. Sanju tells you superstars are humans too. They can make bad, even horrible decisions -- like every other human being on earth and we shouldn’t be quick to judge them. Ranbir Kapoor’s performance is the soul of the film. Ranbir somehow convinced himself that he was actually Sanjay Dutt -- and hence the physical transformations and the voice modulations looked so convincing. The film is worth a rewatch just for Ranbir’s performance alone.\n\n8. Pad Man (2018)\n\nIn India, men still behave as if periods don't exist and a large number of women still don't have access to sanitary pads. Pad Man is a fictionalised account of the life of Arunachalam Murganatham. He understood that only a meagre percentage of women in India use sanitary pads and went on to create a low-cost process for making sanitary napkins. Today, women cooperatives across India use his technology to make low-cost sanitary products. In 2014, Time magazine included him as one of the 100 most influential people across the world. In 2016, The Indian government awarded him with a Padma Shri. Thanks to his efforts, the taboos associated with menstruation and menstrual hygiene are slowly getting broken at the grassroots level. Akshay Kumar, who played the lead role, embodied the spirit of Arunachalam Murganatham. It was a sincere effort on the actor’s part. His speech towards the end about why he thought of making affordable sanitary pads, though long, was straight from the heart. You felt you're watching someone with genuine concern for women and not just an actor going through the paces.\n\n9. Thackeray (2019)\n\nDirector: Abhijit Panse\n\nCast: Nawazuddin Siddiqui, Amrita Rao\n\nIt’s a film based on the life of Shiv Sena supremo Balasaheb Thackeray. Bal Keshav Thackeray, popularly known as Balasaheb, was the son of social reformist Keshav Sitaram Thackeray, a leading figure in the Samyukta Maharashtra movement. Thackeray took his father’s political legacy to new heights, forming the radical party Shiv Sena in 1966 to give voice to the aspirations of disgruntled Marathi youth. The party has been known for its strong-handed techniques and its anti-outsiders, anti-Muslim stance. Shiv Sena stayed away from active politics, before winning the Maharashtra state elections in 1995. The film follows his rise from being a political cartoonist in the Free Press Journal in 1959 to mentoring his party to power in 1995. The makers didn’t pull any punches and showed him hitting back when his life gets targeted. He’s shown to be a compassionate leader who nevertheless doesn’t believe in democracy within his party. His interactions with wife Meenatai show a softer side to the supremo. Nawazuddin Siddiqui plays Thackeray and the actor intelligently hasn’t blindly mimicked the leader but has subtly tried to bring out the ideology and conviction of the man through his acting and has succeeded. It’s a film that does justice to one of the most unique politicians of our country and is worth revisiting.\n\n10. The Accidental Prime Minister (2019)\n\nDirector: Vijay Ratnakar Gutte\n\nCast: Anupam Kher, Akshaye Khanna, Suzanne Bernert, Aahana Kumra\n\nThe film is an adaptation of Sanjaya Baru's book The Accidental Prime Minister which is the author’s account of the life of ex-Prime Minister Manmohan Singh. He was the Prime Minister of India during 2004-2014 under the UPA alliance. While his first term is considered a success as he brought in many economic reforms and successfully signed a nuclear treaty with America, The second term was tumultuous as it was besieged by many controversies, chief among them being the Radia Tapes and the 2G scam. Manmohan Singh was unfortunately looked upon as a rubber stamp PM and while the film reiterates that rumour, it also tries to balance out things by portraying him in a good light as a person and an economist. It's shown that while Singh might not have been a great talker, his words did have an impact, especially when it came to international diplomacy. His economic reforms too benefited the country a lot. The big problem with the film is that the focus shifts from Singh to Baru. It became more about Baru's turmoils, struggles and moral dilemmas than Singh's.\n\n11. Super 30 (2019)\n\nDirector: Vikas Bahl\n\nCast: Hrithik Roshan, Mrunal Thakur, Virendra Saxena, Pankaj Tripathi, Aditya Shrivastava, Nandish Singh\n\nSuper 30 is an inspiring film based on the life of mathematician Anand Kumar. Anand Kumar is best known for his Super 30 programme, which he started in Patna in 2002. He not only coaches underprivileged students for the IIT entrance test free of cost but provides them with shelter and food for the duration as well. His has really been an inspiring journey, as 422 out of the 480 students till 2018 have cleared the tough entrance test, thanks to his efforts. He has been felicitated by the government and has been the subject of a Discovery Channel documentary. Hrithik Roshan plays the role of Anand Kumar in a film with quiet dedication. One of the themes of the film is that the underprivileged children don’t do well because they lack the confidence in themselves and Anand sets about righting that wrong. He’s shown to be a target of the coaching mafia but doesn’t bow down to their pressure. Hrithik Roshan underplays the anger, the pain, as well as the joy, felt by his character and makes us believe in Anand Kumar. The 30 unknown actors who play his students too have performed well. Overall, it’s an inspiring film indeed and that not only imparts life lessons but entertains as well."
