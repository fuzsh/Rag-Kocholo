I never said yes, then why are people now saying that I have left it? I never confirmed the fact that I am doing the film,\" the 32-year-old said here Monday at the launch of his song \"Gundhi baat\" from his film \"R...Rajkumar.\"\n\n\"I said that I have been offered the film, I have to meet the filmmakers, go through narrations. Now again there are speculations that I am not doing the film,\" he added.\n\nShahid added that he will make an official announcement if he will ever do the film.\n\n\"If I am doing the film, I will let you guys know. I don't come and announce all the films that are offered to me because it's not correct to talk about those films. If I am doing a film, I will announce it,\" said Shahid.\n\nDirected by Tigmanshu Dhulia, \"Milan Talkies\" is produced by Balaji Motion Pictures."
