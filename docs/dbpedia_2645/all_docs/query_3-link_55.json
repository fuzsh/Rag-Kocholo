        "text": "On his recent visit to the state capital, he says, “Ambika Patel earned the name Thokia for his killings and had even ambushed Special Task Force men before he was finally encountered in 2008. I will be narrating the story to Babil as he will gel with the role best like his father and my friend Irfaan in Paan Singh Tomar (2013). I had written it during lockdown.”\n\nKhan has also produced the film Jaakho Rakhe Saaiyan that was shot in Meerut. “It was the Uttar Pradesh government’s subsidy that drew me here and we have shot the entire film here with Arjun Rampal, Tigmanshu Dhulia and has been directed by Rajiv S Ruia. The film is in post-production and some patchwork is left to complete the film. We may go for a web release also. For low budget films, subsidy is the motivation and it’s a blessing that the government has included web projects also,” he said.\n\nThe filmmaker is now geared up for his film Non Stop Dhamaal with Annu Kapoor, Rajpal Yadav and Asrani. “We started the shoot on January 21, but Annuji fell ill a week later (heart ailment). All dates went haywire as we had a huge star cast, but we were able to wrap up the shoot in May before he came to Lucknow for his next film. It’s on the film industry struggle and life in the hub – Aaramnagar (Mumbai). Now, we are looking for a favourable date to release as it’s a big challenge to get theatres amidst big releases,” he says."
