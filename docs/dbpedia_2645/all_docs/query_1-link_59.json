        "text": "Last seen in Bunty Aur Babli 2, actress Rani Mukerji is all set to return to the silver screen with an intense drama, Mrs Chatterjee vs Norway. The almost three-minute trailer of the movie introduces the audience to Debika Chatterjee, Mukerji’s on-screen character, who moves to Norway with her husband and young kids. While they try to build a world for themselves in the foreign country, Debika Chatterjee’s world is shattered when the Norwegian foster care authority arrives at her doorstep and takes away her kids.\n\nDirected by Ashima Chibber, Mrs Chatterjee vs Norway is an intense movie which is inspired by the real-life case of Sagarika Bhattacharya. If you’ve watched the trailer and liked it, then here are a few highly engaging and intense dramas inspired by real-life stories that you can watch on Netflix, Disney+ Hotstar and other online streaming platforms. Scroll down to check out the complete list.\n\n10 movies based on true stories to watch before Rani Mukerji’s Mrs Chatterjee vs Norway releases\n\n1. Sarbjit – YouTube, Google Play Movies & TV\n\nDirected by Omung Kumar, the Randeep Hooda, Aishwarya Rai Bachchan, Richa Chadha and Darshan Kumar starrer tells the tale of Sarabjit Singh, a farmer who accidentally crosses the Indo-Pak border. When he is arrested by the Pakistani army and accused to be the main culprit behind the Lahore bomb blasts, Singh’s sister Dalbir fights to prove her brother’s innocence. Sarbjit is a movie inspired by a real-life incident that you can watch ahead of Rani Mukerji’s Mrs Chatterjee vs Norway’s release.\n\n2. Paan Singh Tomar – Netflix\n\nLate actor Irrfan Khan, who was known for his brilliant on-screen performances, essayed the role of Paan Singh Tomar in Tigmanshu Dhulia’s 2012 biographical drama. While the movie won several accolades, it highlights Tomar’s story, a former Indian Army soldier who won many gold medals at the Indian National Games and the circumstances that forced him to become a dacoit.\n\n3. Shahid – YouTube\n\nKnown for his unconventional choice of roles, Rajkummar Rao won the National Film Award for Best Actor for his performance in filmmaker Hansal Mehta’s 2012 biographical drama Shahid. The movie focuses on the life of Shahid Azmi – a lawyer and human rights activist who was falsely convicted of terrorism and assassinated in 2010. In addition to Rao, the movie also features Mohammed Zeeshan Ayyub, Prabhleen Sandhu and Baljinder Kaur in pivotal roles.\n\n4. Neerja – Disney+ Hotstar\n\nHere’s another biographical movie that told the story of a brave flight attendant Neerja Bhanot, who sacrificed her life while protecting the passengers of the 1986 Pan American flight from hijackers. The highly intense drama helmed by Ram Madhvani stars Sonam Kapoor in the titular role, who won a National Film Award for her strong act in the emotional thriller which was released in 2016.\n\n5. Bhaag Milkha Bhaag – Disney+ Hotstar\n\nFarhan Akhtar‘s sports drama Bhaag Milkha Bhaag is based on Indian athlete Milkha Singh, who represented India at the Commonwealth Games, Asian Games and the Olympics. Helmed by Rakeysh Omprakash Mehra, the biographical drama allowed Akhtar to establish himself as a versatile actor in the competitive industry. The 2013 Hindi drama delves into Singh’s life and shows how he overcame personal obstacles for his country and earned the name of The Flying Sikh. A highly engaging drama that promises to strike an instant chord, just like Rani Mukerji’s Mrs Chatterjee vs Norway movie trailer.\n\n6. Padman – Netflix, ZEE5\n\nThe story of Akshay Kumar and Radhika Apte starrer Padman which won the National Film Award for Best Film on Other Social Issues in 2019, is based on the life of a social activist and entrepreneur – Arunachalam Muruganantham. Kumar’s role in the movie is inspired by Muruganantham, the man who is known for creating low-cost sanitary pads for women in rural areas.\n\n7. Talvar – Disney+ Hotstar, Netflix, YouTube, Google Play Movies & TV\n\nFilmmaker Meghna Gulzar’s thriller drama Talvar starring Konkona Sen Sharma and Neeraj Kabi and late actor Irrfan Khan is based on the mysterious 2008 Noida double murder case that had rattled the entire nation. The story delves into the complex murder case while presenting the movie through the perspective of three main characters. While the Aarushi Talvar murder case remains a mystery to date, Gulzar managed to keep the audience on the edge of their seats by turning the complicated and tense narrative into a brilliant movie with her filmmaking skills.\n\n8. No One Killed Jessica – Netflix, YouTube, Google Play Movies & TV\n\nNo One Killed Jessica starring Vidya Balan and Rani Mukerji is an excellent option to watch while you’re waiting for Mrs Chatterjee vs Norway. The murder mystery is based on Jessica Lal’s murder case, another shocking incident that sent shockwaves across the entire nation. Despite many witnesses, it took years for Jessica Lal’s murderer – the son of an influential politician, to receive punishment.\n\n9. Article 15 – Netflix\n\nDirector Anubhav Sinha’s crime thriller Article 15 is inspired by the multiple real-life crimes driven by caste-based discrimination in the country, including the 2014 Badaun gang rape incident. Actor Ayushmann Khurrana plays the role of a police officer in the intense drama who embarks on a journey to investigate the disappearances of teenage girls from a village. But what he discovers is a shocking truth that is ignored by many. You can watch this intense drama on before Mrs Chatterjee vs Norway releases.\n\n10. Special 26 – Jio Cinema, Google Play Movies & TV, Apple TV+"
