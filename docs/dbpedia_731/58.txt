Sony has delivered a MotorStorm Apocalypse dev diary video -- and it's quite festive. Seriously: it features "The Festival," which is the single-player campaign mode of the game. As you can see in the video below, the Festival mode will offer up a real story to go with your urban wasteland racing, seen through the eyes of three characters: a rookie, a pro and a veteran.

Races in the mode occur in a set sequence, and while some will make use of the new Supercar and Superbike classes others will get crazy with vehicle choices, like pitting one measly motorcycle against a whole field of competitors in big rigs.

This latest sequel to MotorStorm and its Split/Second-esque take on urban racing is looking pretty darn good from a gameplay standpoint, but its visuals are clearly still a ways from being finished. Hopefully they'll be spruced up by the time the demo hits.
