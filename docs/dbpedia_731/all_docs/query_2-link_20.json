        "meta_description": "MotorStorm was one of those rare beasts: a decent, nay, excellent launch title. Splendid graphics, a real sense of heft and/or lightness - depending on the vehicle you chose - and mud, sand and rock textures that were so real you almost felt the need to spit dirt flecks from your mouth post race. Besides that, it had a crazed sense of abandon and almost post-apocalyptic nihilism. You were in the desert, racing these insanely powered up vehicles through tracks that looked like abandoned sets from Mad Max 2.\r\n\r\nWith eight tracks, and some decent downloadable content - which included four extra tracks, not to mention co-op and multiplayer, MotorStorm shut up a lot of naysayers and reassured PS3 owners that, yes, their platform of choice was indeed a choice platform. So, has MotorStorm: Pacific Rift (PR) just bunged on a few new maps, maybe another vehicle or two, and tried to catch lightning in a bottle all over again?\r\n\r\nThe answer, rather pleasingly, is no. In fact MotorStorm: Pacific Rift has taken the lunatic thrills of the first game and ratcheted them up. A lot.",
