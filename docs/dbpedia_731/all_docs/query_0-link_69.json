        "text": "Resistance 2\n\nPlaystation 3, Insomniac Games, M (Mature)\n\n\"Resistance: Fall of Man\" did one thing that I did not think was possible. It made fighting alien, mutated life-forms fun again. How many Technicolor, scaly, musty, multi-eyed creatures can a person eradicate? The game offers something a bit different, fighting advance-life forms in a post-WWII setting with 1950s technology. Now things become interesting. By taking a risk in melding time eras into an \"alternate\" reality, the game creates a compelling mix of storytelling and chaotic action.\n\n\"Resistance 2\" brings the action home to the United States -- yes, the apple pie-eating, Ed Sullivan-watching, DeSoto-driving America of 1953. Fans ultimately will have a splendid time, but there are changes that could make this exceptional game legendary.\n\nThe first thing that will grab players' attention is the expanded scope of what goes on during the game. The point that you are fighting in a land of total devastation is driven home not only by the overall landscape presented in each level, but also by how flesh pods, creaky structures, eerie moments and strange noises come together to affect your senses. Some enemies are small and attack in packs; others are gargantuan and require that you use help.\n\n\"Resistance 2\" mixes up everything to keep you guessing. But there is plenty of help available from grunt soldiers and other characters. In squad-based action the attention is always on you; running and hiding is not an option. In some of the larger engagements, other soldiers can buy you time to regain your wits, but there is still little room to be reckless.\n\nThe actions follows the formula of taking players on a trip through tight corridors with surprises sprinkled here and there, leading them to a skirmish with a decent mix of enemies -- medium and heavily armed -- and finally dropping them off in purgatory where everything including the kitchen sink and the dirty water in it is thrown at them. The action can support armies of enemies at a time.\n\nIf there is a disappointing moment to the action it's the \"Boss\" characters. These paint-by-numbers affairs pale in comparison to everything else that is encountered.\n\nWeapons work seamlessly. Each has primary and secondary fire functions. Switching weapons is easy; reloading can be a bit slow. Not having to cycle through to grenades is a lifesaver and makes fighting more efficient. Weapon choices are crucial and depend on the situation. The wrong weapon equals a quick death. If there is a weapon just lying around, like a Magnum handgun or a Wraith machine gun, take it as a hint of what's to come and pick it up. Just a bit of friendly advice, from ol' Chimera bait here.\n\nOnline the game changes completely. There is a multiplayer mode with a new story line. Action is class-based and supports eight players. This isn't a bad deal, especially when you are trying to focus on your objectives and it makes the game nmore personal. The more traditional online mode supports up to 60 players with more than 60 maps. The server runs smoothly, and the matchmaking function is accurate. \"Resistance 2\" is the rare sequel that improves on the original. Grade: A\n\nMotorStorm: Pacific Rift\n\nPlaystation 3, Evolution Studios, T (Teen)\n\nDescription: A mud-churning, tire-burning racing simulation game.\n\nFeatures: This is an extensive off-road racing game. Controls are not very technical. Gas, brake, turn and boost are all that you need to master it. The racing has an arcade feel but grows with intensity as the game moves along. \"The Festival\" -- the main single-player mode -- has 96 races for players to traverse. Tracks are split into four zones -- Earth, Fire, Water, and Air -- each element plays a major role in the track design. The designs are layered with obstacles. The \"best\" route to take on the track is determined by the vehicle you use. Bikes are not suitable for mud or marsh. Larger vehicle can have a tough time navigating tight turns or maintaining control when airborne. There are eight vehicle classes to choose from; bikes and racing trucks are the safest choices in most races. Online player can mash it up with 11 other racers. The action is a bit orderly and offers different levels of competition. Grade: B+\n\nFar Cry 2\n\nXbox 360, Ubisoft, M (Mature)\n\nDescription: A mercenary tries to erase a double-dealing arms trader.\n\nFeatures: Players get to choose from nine characters at the beginning of the story. Who you choose can affect how you play the game. The characters who you don't choose make appearances throughout the action as \"buddies\" to help you out of a jam from time to time. Sometimes you call them, sometimes they call you, and sometimes they just show up. The only time they are helpful is when they offer goods or information to advance the main goal. Their fighting leaves a lot to be desired. The environment is wide open. Choose to travel the roads -- not recommended until you are comfortable with the fighting controls -- or take the \"quick\" travel bus system. The game allows players to gain his or her own \"intelligence.\" Sites can be scouted to gain the most information possible before going into a firefight. The targeting system is only as good as your aim. There is no \"target-lock\" here to save players nor do you see every bullet coming. This is a nice touch of realism that keeps you on your toes. Online, players can compete in four basic match-types using six classes of soldiers. Grade: B\n\nBackyard Football '09\n\nNintendo Wii, Atari, E (Everyone)"
