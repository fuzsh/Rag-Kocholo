We both hit it in exactly the same direction but I hit it going quicker. On the way down you could see that I was gaining on him and I said out loud to myself \"This is going to end so badly\".\n\nSure enough he hit the ground and I landed directly on top of him, his vehicle exploded on impact and I just carried on going\n\nSimply awesome.

Even though I know that track like the back of my hand and it's one of my favourites. I guess all of the speed events are hard, no matter wht track you're on.\n\nOh my ****ing god, the level 6 race at Colossus Canyon ('No Escape') is making me want to smash my TV in. I swear it's impossible to come 1st, I have managed a close 2nd but whenever I try to take the route the computer takes to win, I end up falling into a massive hole near the waterfall, whereas they somehow clear the jump even without boosting.\n\nAnyone got any idea how to win it? I've driven perfect races over and over and just can't get any better than 2nd.

Try too see what they use and then try again.\n\nYou are limited to a racing truck for that race, and that's what they're using.\n\nI think it's just the AI level, I'm trying to do a race on Razorback now and I can't do any better than 4th, the AI just keep ganging up on me and forcing me off the track at any oppurtunity. It seems it suffers from the same ridiculous difficulty curve as the original.\n\nWell gang up on them and see how they like it!\n\nI've reached Level 7 and now the game has just become insanely difficult. I've pretty much given up on the single player because it's simply too hard to enjoy, especially when they decide it will be 'fun' to put you on a bike against a grid full of monster trucks that are able to take quicker routes than you.\n\nAbsolutely ridiculous. This game has been ruined for me in single player.\n\nI've given up too, I'm now where near as far as you but I seem to lack the motivation to get any further. I'll probably wait till a friend comes round to see if I can push the boundaries a bit more, or just have fun in splitscreen or online. I mean its still a great game, but it just is still infruitating the higher the level is.\n\nI've reached Level 7 and now the game has just become insanely difficult. I've pretty much given up on the single player because it's simply too hard to enjoy, especially when they decide it will be 'fun' to put you on a bike against a grid full of monster trucks that are able to take quicker routes than you.\n\nIn that case, this game sounds even more promising for me. 👍\n\nOne man's poison is another man's treasure.\n\nI have not yet had the time to play MotorStormPR yet, with the exception of some fun offline multi-player games with some friends during a party, however, if what you say is true, then like the first MotorStorm it sounds like I'm going to really enjoy it as I really liked the added challenge in that the further you advance the more the AI takes an aggressive role in trying to stop you.\n\nI like games that have variety and options. Like the original MotorStorm, as long as they give you the option of being in races where the AI is not always out to kill you, and offer some variable gameplay options, I'll be happy!\n\nIn the original MotorStorm they also added a Time Trial mode, which was great for a more sim-style mode where your results are based on your abilitity and technique and not impacted by AI or other players, and even had a ghost car option to compare your lap times and techniques with others as well as yourself. 👍\n\nIs that mode also available in MSPR?\n\nI have not yet had the time to play MotorStormPR yet, with the exception of some fun offline multi-player games with some friends during a party, however, if what you say is true, then like the first MotorStorm it sounds like I'm going to really enjoy it as I really liked the added challenge in that the further you advance the more the AI takes an aggressive role in trying to stop you.\n\nI like games that have variety and options.

They still tend to set out to kill you at later levels.\n\nJust a heads-up, the EU store now has a revised demo (version 2.0) for this game. I have not compared it to the original demo, nor have I read what the difference are between the two.\n\nEDIT:\n\nI just downloaded the new demo, and from what I can tell so far the difference is that you get a new course, Razorback, which is frankly what they should have used in the first place as it is not only longer than Rain God Spires, but it is also a more compelling course what with the bigger jumps, waterfalls, and water crossings.\n\nThe new demo also replaces the racing truck with a buggy, but the other vehicle choices remain unchanged with the same bike and monster truck as before.\n\nThe only other difference that I have spotted is that in Split-Screen mode, it now has a 12 car field instead of 8.\n\nI just downloaded the new demo, and from what I can tell so far the difference is that you get a new course, Razorback, which is frankly what they should have used in the first place as it is not only longer than Rain God Spires, but it is also a more compelling course what with the bigger jumps, waterfalls, and water crossings.\n\nRazorback is one of my favourite tracks, that jump by the waterfall is immense, and the last bit as you fly through the caves is always intense. Have you tried the alternative route down the caves, through the river, yet? It generally only works in larger vehicles.\n\nAt the moment I am stuck with the level 8 races. I have gold for everything else and instantly can only do a best of bronze on level 8. I am simply nowhere near the leader anymore from being able to win by 1-2 seconds quite easily. Wish the game had a less steep difficulty increase.\n\nLevel8 can be pain in the <fill in blanks here>\n\nSome things i (try to) do:\n\n- Never give up if the first lap goes bad, sometimes you even win.\n\n- As said above AI in front of you will slow down, so most of the time if youre somewhere 3-4-5th in the race on lap 2 then they will not go mega fast in the last lap\n\n- Save boost for the last parts of the races, not using boost also seems to help, in elimination rounds its needed some times but i try to avoid it untill last part of the race.\n\n- Practice the last part of a track since its boosting to the finish line\n\n- Have luck (dunno how though )\n\nHave all races gold EXCEPT tidal takedown ... its just insane that race.\n\nAnyone with tips for the track and bikes/atv is welcome 👍\n\nHopefully the AI will crash in the last part or so."
