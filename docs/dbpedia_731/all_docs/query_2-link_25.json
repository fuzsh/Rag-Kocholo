        "text": "Glorious follow up to one of the greatest off road racing game to date.\n\nUser Rating: 8 | MotorStorm: Pacific Rift PS3\n\nLet me say this first Motorstorm was nothing short then fun. The single player campaign could have had more events and customizable races (missing feature) but what made the game stand out, at least for me, was the multiplayer. The feeling of seeing vehicles, or pieces of them, fling left and right meanwhile you make last second corrections to not to fall on a pit or slam against an obstacle could not be described by words.\n\nBut lets dig Motorstorm 2:\n\nThe GOOD:\n\n- Graphic: best graphic ever for an off road game.\n\nThe race tracks have a lot of variety and each of them has his how character and will leave you breathless for their beauty. You will race in forests, lava, beaches, volcanic craters, waterfalls etc.\n\nLot of chaos on the screen but I haven't seen any slowdown, frame rate is 30 rock solid.\n\n- Sound: Usual cacophony of engines and a really nice soundtrack which includes many many songs (not sure if we can set our own play-list though).\n\n- Gameplay: Same mayhem multiplied by 4, as 4 are the elements you will be racing on. Each element will require a specific approach, so if you are racing on the beach you should quickly decide when run on the water to cool off you engine. On the lava river fire will be ur worst enemy, so jumps will be the best way to avoid certain death, and so on....\n\n- Online: No lag, excellent mic support, super chaotic.\n\n- Future DLC: Yes they are coming and I hope at the proper price (if not free!!)\n\nThe BAD:\n\n- Controls: I noticed that to make the damn vehicle turn it is a pain. Controls in the first Motorstorm were more tight. Here you really need to work your way with boosters and breaks to perform the proper turns. (nothing that a patch cannot fix).\n\n- Repetitive: True there are a lot of events, but it would have been nice to insert something like leagues for each vehicle with trophies and tournaments in different classes. Also the addition of different engine types would have been appreciated. Small engines vehicles not being able to cover long jump or slowing down too much in water would have added an extra strategic factor.\n\n- Too many straights on the race tracks: fast vehicles will disappear into the horizon leaving the slower ones in the dust. I would have preferred more curves to keep the pack of racers more compact and test everybody driving skills instead of booster management. The first MT was good at making u feel closer and closer to victory and then punish you with a last second error.\n\nLastly to all of those people that think that this is just a \"booster pack\" I would suggest to rent it first and experience the massive mayhem of the online racing, you will enjoy.\n\nTo Evolution studio, please fix the steering .. thanks !\n\nOther Helpful Reviews for MotorStorm: Pacific Rift\n\nRating:8\n\nAn awesome game, is it an awesome sequel?\n\nMotorstorm: Pacific Rift is a fun game that expands on its predecessor not gameplaywise but in about every other way possible.
