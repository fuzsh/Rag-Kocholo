        "text": "RFOM - 6\n\na 6 because the multiplayer was good for a week or two. SP was a joke after playing other recent FPS games on other formats.\n\nMotorstorm - 5\n\nSeems like it should be a good game, but it isn't. Similar to burnout, but nowhere near the fun.\n\nF-1 - 7\n\nA good game, but like the real thing it got boring for me pretty fast. Had the longest play from me out of all the games. Still, if your a fan of F-1 you would love it i'm sure.\n\nIs Fight Night not that great on the ps3? It was a 9/10 i'd say on the 360.\n\nin no order\n\nF1CE 7/10 good game never played online though\n\nMotorStorm 7.5/10 One player mode a bit limited but fun not played online, started to play it a bit more recently before that i woulda given it a 7. Does look impressive playing on a big HD tv though.\n\nRFOM 9/10 love it my second fav PS3 game single player bit slow at first but towards the end it was fantastic. Online excellent too far better than a lot of PC FPS i played online.\n\nVirtua Fighter 8.5/10 Didnt think id enjoy the single player as much as i do, dont really miss online though as i dont think it would work well with it. Could spend hours just learning the moves for one character. Multiplayer is good fun though.\n\nFight Night Round 3 7/10 I thought it was ok just not quite my thing though may get back to it sometime.\n\nOblivion 9.5/10 Best PS3 game out at the moment infact i think its prob the best game out on PC or 360. Just so much to do, looks great, runs better than on my PC, very addictive in, and i enjoy the storylines going on. Knights of the nine expansion is ok but as its free cant complain i guess.\n\nmay rate the PS store games later.\n\nRFOM: 8.5 Great FPS game, enjoying the multiplayer mayhem much more than GOW.\n\nMotorstom 8 Great fun, load times and online glitches and lack of 2p mode lose this a point.\n\nF1 CE: 7 Good game, not played an F1 game for a long time. His has just the right amount of depth for me. Don't feel a real sense of speed though (maybe cos its not 60fps?).\n\nFight Night Round 3: 7 Identical to the 360, graphics look a bit washed out in general compared to the 360 and load times are silly. Would be an 8/10 for the 360 version.\n\nNBA Homecourt: TBA Only played a couple of games so not sure yet closest game I have played to it is NBA jam which was like 10yrs ago!\n\nSpider-man 3: TBA Just got today.\n\nrp2000\n\nR:FOM - 8 - Great story, actually different for a change, not the usual, here are aliens shoot. But Aliens in a WW2 style, i like the twist. Just stick with it, most folk don't get past 1 or 2 hours, but after that is when it gets great. Also multiplayer is fantastic, a return to the quake3/UT days IMO\n\nF1: CE - 8 again But i love F1 and racing F1 online as pretty as that is is great. I recently started playing quite a bit of Moto GP '06 again and it shows Moto GP '06 right up for bland 2D environments, and i used to think that was a pretty game\n\nMotorstorm - 7 Great pick up and play online, can burn a night through on it no probs, but Single player sucks. Its very pretty though, and i hope they have some decent DLC\n\nRiiiidddggge Racerrrr - 7 Pretty game, same as every other ridge racer, just don't like the events structure\n\nVF5 - 8 Gorgeous, possibly the nicest looking game of the gen, definatly on the console, maybe pipped by GoW. Plays great but i think it is more of a 2 people game rather than fight the AI.\n\nUL: Dark Kingdom - 6 Generic hack and slash like UT on the PSP was. Not to bad to pass away the time, its relativly nice looking, better than ninty Nine Nights as it is more story driven and has a decent amount of save points If you can pick it up cheap, go ahead.\n\nSpider-Man 3 6/7 - meh only played 20-30 mins and it isn't as pretty as i thought it was going to be, will put some time into it and see if it grips me, so this score may become a permanent 6 or a 7, doubt it will get higher than a 7 tbh.\n\nSo thats all my games, butttttttttt the best game on the PS3 at the moment is God Of War 2. Sod the PS3 games and buy that now!!!\n\nR:FOM 8 - Decent enough FPS with excellent MP, which lifts it above other recent efforts in the genre.\n\nMotorstorm 6 - Maybe I'm missing something but this just seems like a glorified tech demo to me. Looks nice and has a good soundtrack but the gameplay just isn't there. The load time of the vehicles somewhat surprised me, too.\n\nGenji: Days of the Blade 4 - My interest in this game waned very soon after getting past the Giant Enemy Crab, which I just had to see for myself. Looks very pretty, but last gen gameplay and terrible viewing angles.\n\nGT:HD 7 - Can't really argue for free.\n\nFlow 6 - Good fun for a couple of hours.\n\nTekken DR 7.5 - It's Tekken. In HD!!\n\nResistance: Fall of Man - 10/10\n\nExcellent single player and multiplayer experience. Truly have to play the whole game to appreciate it though.\n\nThe Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion - 9/10\n\nOne of my all time favourite games, so much so ive bought it on everything its been released on! Runs the best on PS3.\n\nVirtua Fighter 5 - 9/10\n\nHas to be the best fighting game i have ever played and i basically played em all! Extremely fluid fast yet slow paced fighting game that is easy to pick up and play but hard to master! Love it!\n\nFormula One - 9/10\n\nIf you like Formula 1 you'll love this, solid frame-rates, crisp graphics and great commentary make this game a must!\n\nMotorstorm - 8/10\n\nIs a good game but i'm getting increasingly infuriated by the later levels as they are too hard! Also the lack of tracks and hard to find online races bring the score down.\n\nJosh"
