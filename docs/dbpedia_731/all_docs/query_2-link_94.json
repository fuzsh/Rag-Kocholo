        "text": "Format: PS3\n\nDeveloper: Evolution Studios\n\nPublisher: Sony Computer Entertainment\n\nReleased: Thursday March 31st\n\nScore: 8/10\n\nA confession. Motorstorm Apocalypse has been one of the most uncomfortable gaming experiences I've ever had. You see, my review copy arrived on March 11th, a day that will live forever in infamy. After waking early and spending the morning in the company of some of the most harrowing televisual images of our generation, a spot of escapism on the PS3 seemed like a good, if a somewhat selfish, idea.\n\nAlthough I knew exactly what Motorstorm Apocalypse was, I hadn’t connected the dots until I saw that first freeway torn apart by the game’s premise-setting earthquake. You see, this is a racing game set in a city being torn apart by natural disasters, and one in which you’re asked to revel and exploit as the devastation unfurls around you. So it was with a sense of guilt and awkward discomfort that I hurried through the opening races. When I hit the startlingly evocative tsunami level, though, I had to call it a day.\n\nObviously, it’s utterly facile to complain about merely playing a videogame, but Motorstorm Apocalypse has to be one the most unfortunately timed products ever. Sony has rightly delayed the release until this week in the EU, and even a week removed from the Japanese Tsunami itself, it’s much easier to critique the game in its own right. Evolution Studios shouldn’t be chastised either, this is not a tasteless piece of software in any way, no more so than any Hollywood disaster blockbuster you could care to mention. Just unfortunate.\n\nNor should Evolution's achievements be ignored. In setting its third Motorstorm in this crumbling metropolis, the team has crafted a visually bombastic and uniquely dangerous racer that manages to combine the multi-vehicle madness of its predecessors with something altogether more spectacular.\n\nThe meat of the single-player game, as ever, is the Motorstorm Festival. Instead of just presenting players with a series of events, though, Evolution has decided to tell an overarching story through three characters, each one representing a difficulty (Rookie, Pro and Veteran). It’s a cringe-worthy tale of jumped-up petrolheads, an evil governmental oligarch and an undercover journalist, all told through the medium of awful semi-animated comic book panels. It’s agonising, in all honestly, but does give the developers a logical reason to recycle tracks while maintaining the pretence that this is all happening during a three day disaster.\n\nAs for the tracks themselves, they’re a mixed bag, varying from instantly forgettable to truly stunning, seemingly on a race-by-race basis. The likes of Skyline, with its terrifying rooftop dash across crumbling skyscrapers, will go down as one of the truly great racing game courses. Others, like Downtown’s oval dash through some rubble with a few ramps, are a real letdown. Evolution has always been masterful in creating tracks with their own personality and nuance, from the twisting menace of Dirt Devil in the original Motorstorm to the cloud-piercing vertigo of Pacific Rift’s Raingod Spires, but the disparity in quality here is disappointing.\n\nWhen it’s good, though, it’s very good. The beauty of Motorstorm has always been in the battles between different vehicle classes, and that core struggle is still a vital part of Apocalypse. The tracks are designed to support all vehicle types, from tiny superbikes up to hulking big rigs. Coming out on top requires an innate understanding of what you’re using and how best to use it. If you’re on a bike or strapped into an ATV and you’re going shoulder to shoulder with the big boys down in the muddy underpasses, you can expect to be swatted away like a bothersome tick. It’s like a gasoline-fuelled jungle. You have to know how to survive. Makes that Evolution name even more appropriate.\n\nBattling through the Festival mode, despite the insidious story, is unquestionably a PS3 highlight. Even when you’re lining up on the same track as a Pro that you’d already bested as a Rookie, there are huge differences. Each tack has its own set of variations, some featuring the trailer-making ‘events’ that’ll have jaws agape, some just skilfully and subtly constructed to test your driving wit. And some, unfortunately, that are just a bit drab. Still, there’s a real sense of progression as you battle though to finish in the top 3 to continue, or avoid expulsion in the new ‘Eliminator’ races, which explode the last-placed vehicle at regular timed intervals.\n\nLess thrilling, though, is getting stuck. For such a forward-looking racer, Motorstorm Apocalypse is oddly stuck in the past when it comes to progression. Nowadays, we’re used to being able to pick from a selection of events in our racers, but Apocalypse is purely linear. Can’t qualify? Keep trying or give up. And when you’ve been thrust back into fourth place because the track decided to hurl an unavoidable rock at your face, it’s somewhat frustrating. The kind of somewhat frustrating that sees you popping down to town to buy a replacement Dual Shock.\n\nStill, the Wrekreation free-race mode is as complete as ever, allowing you to set up your own combination of track and vehicle and just enjoying the ride. Online, too, is a blast, awarding you XP chips as you progress through the levels, and offering the buttery smooth vehicular combat the series has always promised but never quite delivered.\n\nA lot to admire, then. The third Motorstorm may have stripped away some of the class of its predecessors and replaced it with noise and bluster, but it has done so with a technical bravado that is, at times, astonishing. The handling is tight and playful, the visuals arresting and the exhilaration of winning tangible. Beware, though. Even the most ardent thrill-seeker will need a strong constitution to stomach this particular apocalypse. Escapism this most certainly isn’t."
