        "text": "Say what you want about the future, but for right now, 3D isn't all the rage. Sure, it's popping up in movies and games, but not every consumer is embracing it and most games aren't making the most of it. MotorStorm Apocalypse is one of the rare exceptions. Ever since IGN first saw the game running in 3D, editors have been talking about how great it looks and how much the goofy goggles add to the experience.\n\nRecently, a crew of editors descended on a MotorStorm Apocalypse multiplayer event. They tried the online offerings, crashed some cars and got even more quality time with 3D. What did they think? Well...\n\nLoading\n\nPlay\n\nGreg Miller: So, Scott Lowe, MotorStorm Apocalypse. It's the first game that's forced me to learn how to spell \"apocalypse,\" but it's also the first game to have 3D that I actually care about and would want to use. Thoughts?\n\nScott Lowe: Indeed, my use of the word \"apocalypse\" has gone up 134 percent since I got my hands on the game. It is definitely one of the more logical uses of 3D I've encountered -- given the large range of environmental effects -- and it looked pretty good. Having that sense of depth made avoiding falling buildings much easier.\n\nGreg Miller: Yeah, we're coming away from a multiplayer session last week, and what stood out to me there was water splashing on the screen and rolling down to obstruct my view and glass flying at me as I slammed through partitions. In an earlier demo, I drove up the side of a collapsed building, and that was the moment that sold me on 3D being worthwhile in this game. The MotorStorm franchise has always looked great, and this just takes it to the next level. Ugh. That sounded cliche. Anyway, so, we're done. MotorStorm looks phenomenal. Hooray, right?\n\nScott Lowe: Not quite. The game definitely falls victim to a lot of the common issues associated with 3D. For one, the effect highlights some graphical issues, like some rather unimpressive explosion effects, which seemed flat and poorly rendered. Not to mention, the rapidly changing environments and high speeds will likely create issues for anyone who experiences discomfort using 3D.\n\nGreg Miller: Hmm. Interesting. I think I'm such a slack-jawed yokel when it comes to 3D that I just sat there and grinned at the good stuff I saw. I didn't see the flat effects like you did. Sure, that will definitely come when I sit down and play for an extended period of time and get to take it all in without club music from an event assaulting my ears, but I still think the game is breathtaking at first glance. Are the issues a deal breaker for you? I just recorded a video preview where I said this game made 3D matter to me -- should I go and delete that?!\n\nScott Lowe: By no means! The issues I found are not a deal breaker, they're just something to note, and I'll still play it in 3D, because really, how can I turn my back on 3D tornadoes and destruction?\n\nGreg Miller: Exactly. Perhaps I'm still longing for fulfillment after the movie 2012, but the destruction is what really has me excited for MotorStorm Apocalypse. I tinkered with the first two PS3 MotorStorms, but they never really took. They always felt a bit sterile -- race around the island, try not to explode. Here, everything's effed up and only getting more effed up. I'm hitting people, the world changes with each lap, and the scale is really cool from driving up building to trying not to fall into the sea. This one seems like a game I'm going to really dig into. You?\n\nScott Lowe: Totally. It's really hard for me to get into hardcore racing sims like Gran Turismo -- I just don't know and/or care enough about cars. Franchises like MotorStorm, specifically ones with dynamic environments or gameplay mechanics, are always more entertaining. You may not be getting the most authentic racing experience, but you do get to make your rivals' cars explode into pieces by ramming them off the road.\n\nGreg Miller: Vehicular manslaughter is always a crowd pleaser. So, the actual thrust of the event we were at was multiplayer -- good for up to 16 players online, four-player split-screen locally. What did you think of the mode?\n\nScott Lowe: Well, it was hard to get a feel for the full weight of a 16-player match because there weren't enough players. The largest game I was able to compete in was roughly eight or nine players, which was plenty, but not quite as challenging or chaotic as a full match. All the same, having to battle it out against real players amidst total destruction created a fun and unpredictable racing experience. Plus, I won on my first try. I like it when I win.\n\nLoading\n\nPlay\n\nGreg Miller: Well, I never win in racing games (unless it's ModNation Racers ), so that's why I thought the wager system was so cool. From the lobby -- where you can pick vehicle loadouts -- you select a rival and bet that you can beat them. That's a great idea for shlubs like me that know they aren't going to be racing for the gold every time. I could join races with my friends -- four players can play local split-screen and join online matches -- and wager against them instead of solely worrying about first place.\n\nScott Lowe: An incentive structure outside of an unlock system is always welcomed, though it wasn't exactly clear what the wager system amounted to. I'm curious to see what winnings can be used for. Hopefully it's for custom car skins or upgrades, like tailpipes that shoot out sparkles and rainbows.\n\nGreg Miller: OK. So, 3D and multiplayer have been covered. What else you got for me on MotorStorm Apocalypse thoughts?\n\nScott Lowe: I'd just like to add that despite all of the new bells and whistles, this still looks and feels like a MotorStorm game. If you loved it before, you may love it even more now. If you hated it, there's a chance that the new features may sway you. Either way, I'm curious to see how this game turns out when it ships later this year.\n\nGreg Miller: It should be interesting. Like I said, this is the first MotorStorm I've played and gotten super-psyched for. If the pretty cars on a pretty tracks from the past games didn't entice you, maybe the end of the world will.\n\nAlso, way to end sounding like a press release, Scott. \"When it ships later this year.\" Nerd.\n\nScott Lowe: I agree with your assessment.\n\nAnd thanks, Greg, I will forever be known as Scott \"Sounds Like a Press Release\" Lowe because of you!\n\nWhat do you think of MotorStorm Apocalypse's 3D? It's multiplayer? Scott Lowe sounding like a press release? Let us know in the comments below."
