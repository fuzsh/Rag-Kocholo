        "text": "posted 03-15-2007 07:59 PM It has been a very long time since I played a game console other than something produced by Sony, but I have been spending a lot of time on the 360 lately. And at first I had no plans to buy a 360, now I have two and it is still a battle to get playing time with four people that want to play. The 360 is not perfect, it freezes up often and there is a lack of RPG's and good sim racers which is what I like most, it does look nice though and I have been able to find some games that I enjoy playing. And Microsoft has done well with the fact that I am now addicted to getting achievments as well as finishing games. I do not play too much online but X-box live does have a nice balance and promotes community. Add in the Market with its microtransactions(love'em or hate'em) it does keep you coming back for more.\n\nSo a couple of months ago I also picked up a PS3 which has up to now received very little use. For if a game was available on both systems why buy it for the PS3 where I will get no achievement points, there is no downloadable content, and I cannot play with online buddies. The PS3 is a nice system but you can see how little things can change the way you play.\n\nMotorstorm is the first PS3 exclusive that I really wanted to play. It is an arcade dirt/rally racer that features everything from motorcylcles to semitrucks. There is not a defined route through the courses but different routes that you can take, but the different routes tend to favor one type of vehicle or another. As a general rule bigger and heavier vehicles stick to routes lower in the course and like mud better. Lighter and qucker vehicles work better on the higher and dryer routes. The different vehicles do have different a different feel and are very competitive. The AI is decent as they race pretty realistically and will beat on you if you let them. You can win with any vehicle on any course if you know its style and where to drive it. So it has a nice balance. It is not in anyway realistic though as you jump from higher to lower levels and bounce off rocks and things that would destroy a real car. You also do not really drift aka rally but the different terrains do feel different. Mud is sticky and sluggish, hard rock and dirt faster. Hard rock and dirt can be very bumpy though which is difficult for lighter vehicles and their traction. And you have turbo boost which adds a strategic element in when and how to use it. Go too fast and you cannot make the turns, use too much boost and your car blows up so it is very much an arcade racer. Graphically it is amazing with the amount of detail in the terrain, rocks, mud, and other vehicles. Your vehicle shows damage and if you over boost or take too much damage it will blow up into many little pieces. If you crash a motorcycle or ATV \"you\" bounce across the terrain in slomo like a rag doll. The terrain also deforms, junk cars, barrels, trees etc will move from being run into. Ruts form in the mud and it gets stickier and a bit harder to navigate as you continue to lap. There are also mud/dust effects with the camera that changes your visibility from time to time.\n\nThe races consist of up to twelve vechicles and that includes online racing. Online is simple in that you just go and find a race. I like the fact that you can see how many people are online so you can see how likely it is that you can get into a race. With X-box live, sometimes you wait and wait trying to find a match with people that aren't there and you would never know there was noone to compete with. It would be difficult to find a race with particular people on the PS3 if you did not communicate in advance on where you are going to be and you would have to that via third party. So there are pros and cons to both services. As you race online with Motorstorm you gain rankings that seem mostly based on number of races driven although there maybe other factors.\n\nIt has been a very enjoyable game both online and offline. I have won a couple of online races, one of which was a thrilling come from 6th after wrecking for the win race. One of my boys does not like racing games and I have a hard time keeping him off of the PS3 so it has a good fun factor value and the boys love the bashing and crashing. So the PS3 is now in demand again at my house.\n\n-LDM\n\n------------------\n\n\"When faced with certain death, eat strawberries.\"\n\nGT4 Diaries\n\nLDM's GT4 Obsessions\n\nGT4 Obsessions Companion Log\n\nposted 03-21-2007 12:44 PM Another oldie chipping in ...\n\nI am most definitely a XBOX360 convert. After the debacle of the PS3 launch - and no 'titles' to speak of - it is unlikely that this Sony product will ever grace my gameroom. FFXII could also be my last PS2 game - with the system and 80+ games being confined to future moments of nostalgia.\n\nMy primary requirement for a console gaming system - in fact my only requirement - is to play games in my own fantasy world away from the rigor of worklife. I do not need a system that plays HD movies, provides internet access, tells me I'm overweight, and cooks bacon for breakfast - I have a wife for that !!!\n\nI now have 13 XBOX360 games - the latest that is keeping me amused being Dynasty Warriors 5 Empires. One of my favorite game series (although only 2 releases) was Dynasty Tactics, and although Warriors is more hack and slash, it does partially blend the strategic and fighting genres. I'm hoping for a Dynasty Tactics 3 one day!\n\n(LDM - my gamer points are now at 7,000+ for what that's worth as I do not hook up to XBOX live!).\n\nOther 360 games: Oblivion (obviously!); Perfect Dark (very difficult at higher levels); Enchanted Arms; Need for Speed Most Wanted and Carbon (average arcade racers); Tiger Woods 2007 (still analogue); Just Cause (GTA sandbox type); Test Drive Unlimited (nice game - cruisin' Hawaii in some exotic cars); Project Gotham Racer (an OKish GT); Saints Row (another sandbox game with a high degree of difficulty if you're a completionist like me).\n\nObviously I have not attained all of the achievements for these games as many are on-line based. Although I find this a little aggravating I recognize that I'm in the minority when it comes to on-line gaming.\n\nThe game I'm looking forward to is Forza 2 and I may even go on-line and give LDM a run for his money .\n\nLater..."
