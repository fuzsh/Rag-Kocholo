        "text": "MotorStorm Apocalypse, the latest iteration of the franchise, has had a run of bad timing and poor luck. The game, originally scheduled for release earlier this spring, was delayed because its premise — earthquakes and destruction — seemed too similar to real-world events in Japan. It was the right decision and Sony should be recognized for it. Unfortunately, when the game was released last week, it was during the PlayStation Network debacle. All of this is quite unfortunate because MotorStorm Apocalypse is the best edition of the game, so far, and a really fun racer.\n\nThe action takes place in a fictional city that resembles San Francisco in many ways. In the game, there has been a massive earthquake creating an apocalyptic setting and a largely abandoned city. Aftershocks reverberate and there's talk about how \"the big one\" is still on its way. All of this simply sets the stage for a MotorStorm festival that looks like what we'd see if Michael Bay directed The Fast & The Furious.\n\nIn single player campaign, there are three degrees of difficulty. Starting out as a rookie, you race through a series of events using different vehicles, which are pre-selected for you. At rookie, the degree of difficulty is pretty simple and you can make it through entire section of the campaign in a couple of sessions. But then the competition really ratchets up. Once you reach Pro, you'll be fighting for every position and hoping for error-free races.\n\nVehicles come from about a dozen classes including muscle cars, choppers and the old favorites you know from previous games. Your car, truck or bike is equipped with a turbo boost that gives you an extra injection of horsepower to inch ahead of your adversaries. But be careful — boosting too much can cause your engine to blow up and you have to monitor your temperature gauge when boosting. Driving through water or flying off a jump can quickly cool your engine down and leave you ready to boost again.\n\nThere's a minor combat mechanic to the game, but it's nowhere near as satisfying as the one found in the Burnout series or the old Road Rash games. Still, there's plenty to be happy with. As you scream down abandoned streets and hurtle across old shipyards, zip through parks and fly over rooftops, your environment is constantly changing. Skyscrapers tumble, bridges collapse and Mother Nature causes further destruction with aftershocks that change the landscape. Whether you are winning or losing, races are wonderfully exciting and feel completely different as you progress from track to track. A population of \"crazies\" have stayed behind and haze you as you race, getting in your way or throwing Molotov cocktails as you race past. You can take them out, but they aren't worth any points, so the Death Race aficionados will only be half-satisfied.\n\nThere's also a big multiplayer aspect to this game with track construction, race betting and 16 player races. But since PSN is still down and there's no return in sight, I can't report on how the multiplayer is. Overall, Motorstorm Apocalypse (the part I was able to play) is great fun and a good addition to your collection if you like racing games or the franchise. The game is rated T for Teen for crude humor, drug references, language, suggestive themes, and violence.\n\nMotorStorm Apocalypse is $59.99 and available now, exclusively for the Sony PlayStation 3.\n\nDisclosure: Sony sent GeekDad a review copy of this game.\n\nIf you haven't yet (or lately) you can donate to help the victims of the Japanese tsunami.\n\nUSPS Text Scammers Duped His Wife, So He Hacked Their Operation\n\nThe Smishing Triad network sends up to 100,000 scam texts per day globally. One of those messages went to Grant Smith, who infiltrated their systems and exposed them to US authorities.\n\n‘Sinkclose’ Flaw in Hundreds of Millions of AMD Chips Allows Deep, Virtually Unfixable Infections\n\nResearchers warn that a bug in AMD’s chips would allow attackers to root into some of the most privileged portions of a computer—and that it has persisted in the company’s processors for decades.\n\nThe Benefits of Ozempic Are Multiplying\n\nThere’s mounting evidence that GLP-1 drugs have health benefits beyond diabetes and weight loss, for conditions ranging from addiction to Parkinson’s—and scientists are evolving theories of why.\n\nOpenAI Warns Users Could Become Emotionally Hooked on Its Voice Mode\n\nThe company has revealed details of AI model safety testing—including concerns about its new anthropomorphic interface.\n\nAI Is Heating the Olympic Pool\n\nA data center in Paris has been hooked up to the energy system heating the Olympic pool. But critics say that projects recycling data centers’ excess heat are a distraction from the real environmental costs of AI.\n\nHow Hackers Extracted the ‘Keys to the Kingdom’ to Clone HID Keycards\n\nA team of researchers have developed a method for extracting authentication keys out of HID encoders, which could allow hackers to clone the types of keycards used to secure offices and other areas worldwide.\n\nThe 20 Best Movies on Amazon Prime Right Now\n\nThe Idea of You, Brittany Runs a Marathon, and American Fiction are just a few of the movies you should be watching on Amazon Prime Video this week.\n\nDoes Jewelry and Big Hair Slow Down Olympic Runners?\n\nEven a little added weight and air drag can make a measurable difference. But WIRED's physics guru says, if it makes you feel strong, go for it!"
