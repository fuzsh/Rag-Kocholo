SCEI spokesperson Phil Harrison cant stop talking about it, and we see why...\n\nis this the first racing killerapp for the ps3? or do people simply have to know that you can download GTHD for free.\n\ndiscuss...\n\nok... the title of the thread kinda made me interested so i clicked it...\n\nDamn u caught me!\n\nnow what are we talking about here? a PS3 game I'm assuming? any details? or should i go read about it on some other forum?\n\nsorry, this was the direct from the news post where the trailer/information was there. take a look at \"http://www.trinigamers.com/forums/showthread.php?t=4038\"]Ps3:Motorstorm. is it more real than real life?? - TriniGamers\n\nand for you dial up-ers,\n\nmotorstorm is the off road racing game being released in a couple of days in the US. it boasts some of the best graphical content seen so far on the ps3, to rival and even better that of the GTHD game which is available for download on Playstation online.\n\ni cant begin to explain the graphic technology behind the game, but i can provide screenshots for your viewing pleasure.\n\nThe game is quite appealing visually, certainly some amazing visuals, however excitement from Sony Executives like Harrison doesn't say much anymore.\n\nAs long as the multiplayer experience is solid this game should be a good release.\n\nNB, racing titles traditionally fare best on the european markets, now if only some more units could be sent to Europe\n\nToo many times have we seen the old Sony Spin hyping up stuff. This is going to definitely be a wait and see as with all things Sony. \"More real than real life\" That's a true Sony Spin line right there.\n\nbill, you do not have permission to access this page.
