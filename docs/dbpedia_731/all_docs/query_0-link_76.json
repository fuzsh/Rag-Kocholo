(Though I suggest ATV)\n\nThere are 4 main areas you need to make changes in, Parts, Livery, Stickers and Personalisation.\n\nEach vehicle type has different selections in these 4 areas depending on the vehicle type so the quickest one to do will be the ATV.\n\nParts - Wheels, Frame, Headlights, Front Mudguards, Handlebars, Engine, Footrests, Rear Mudguards, Bodywork, Tail-Lights and Exhaust System.\n\nLivery - Base Colour, Vinyl Design, Vinyl Colours 1, 2 and 3\n\nStickers - Artwork and Stickers 1 - 5\n\nPersonalisation - Race Number, Weathering, Grunge and Scratches.\n\nMake changes in all these areas and press 'Save and Exit' and the trophy will pop in the loading screen."
