        "text": "Conclusion\n\nTo conclude, let me emphasize that I did not include a section where I talk about the game's faults. That's because it simply does what it does extremely well. While PURE is not a perfect game, any minor flaws are completely overshadowed by the amount of fun you'll have playing it. Black Rock Studio definitely has another winner on its hands. Sadly, I do feel that the game will go underappreciated due to the lack of publicity prior to its release. After all, a game this fun should not go unnoticed. As I mentioned at the beginning of this review, PURE caters to those who can appreciate its whimsical approach to racing. It's definitely a departure from games like GRID, but should hit home for those who enjoy the TrackMania games. The focus is definitely on the amusement factor here. While I rarely hand out wholehearted recommendations, you have mine as I firmly believe that games like PURE are the reason we play video games. It's lighthearted, over-the-top, unrealistic, and above all, pure fun.\n\nExcellent handling\n\nIntuitive control scheme\n\nEnjoyable vehicle customization\n\nLargely fun aerial stunts\n\nBeautiful graphics\n\nLack of split-screen option\n\nLack of variety in multiplayer modes\n\nPURE takes the serious aspect of off-road racing and throws it out the window with its high-flying stunts and high speed action. You might find better racing games out there, but you'll be hard pressed to find one that's as much fun to play."
