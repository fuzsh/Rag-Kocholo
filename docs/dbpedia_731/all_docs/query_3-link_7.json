I realized something as I played it: My favorite racing games are those that are the most violent and chaotic. So far I’ve played and enjoyed (beyond Motorstorm):\n\nWreckfest\n\nTest Drive: Eve of Destruction\n\nThe Flatouts\n\nThe Burnouts\n\nThe Carmageddons\n\nBloody Rally Show\n\nSplit/Second\n\nDeath Rally\n\nGas Guzzlers Extreme\n\nRoad Redemption\n\nSo are there other chaotic, violent racing games I’ve not yet played that I should?\n\nThanks for your time!\n\nIt’s a joke.\n\nOn the PC Engine there was an insane top down racing game called Dekoboko. It sucks single player, but as a 5 player games I don’t think I have ever seen this level of multiplayer mayhem. Near unplayable, though, I guess: that’s a thin line that is very easy to cross!\n\nIt’s not a great game, but Full Auto 2 had a certain charm to it. Play on PlayStation if you can, as that version was better. This was a repackaged version of the original iirc, and not really a sequel (though it had some improvements).\n\nI loved Rollcage 1/2 back in the day. These had a recent spiritual sequel called Grip.\n\nOh nice!\n\nMy only real addition to this kind of gnarly petrolhead chaotic racing is the brilliant BlazeRush which I reckon is one of the best single-screen elimination style racers since Micro Machines popularised/started it (SpeedRunners is the other!). It was @tomchick who highlighted this in a thread some years back and it’s honestly been one of the most consistently well received games I’ve whipped out at games nights."
