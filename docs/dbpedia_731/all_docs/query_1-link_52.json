        "text": "7.5 Presentation\n\nAside from the basic one-player run and online modes thereâ€™s little else to explore, although the ticket system introduces the different elements of the game well.\n\n9.0 Graphics\n\nWhether youâ€™re gawping at the superbly-realised tracks or drooling over the insane detail of the cars, MotorStormâ€™s sharp visuals will make your jaw hit the floor.\n\n9.0 Sound\n\nThe â€˜liveâ€™ versions of rock classics that pound away in the background match the action perfectly, while the guttural grunt of your mud-buster is suitably meaty.\n\n8.5 Gameplay\n\nThis is off-roading at its most visceral, a high-octane racing epic that really does push your driving skills to the limit. The AI can be a bit much sometimes, though.\n\n8.0 Lasting Appeal\n\nGrabbing gold in all 21 tickets will take some doing, then thereâ€™s the brilliantly simple but infinitely enjoyable online mode to get stuck into. No split-screen is disappointing.\n\n9.0\n\nOutstanding OVERALL\n\n(out of 10 / not an average)\n\nA slightly different outake from IGN's UK review.\n\nPretty much what I expected, around 8-9's across the board and www.metacritic.com and www.gamerankings.com averages show that. I picked it up on release day and it's been great fun. Visceral game play I haven't experienced for a long while. Not sure any other game can compare to the fun I've had. But it's like a Road Rash mixed with Colin McRae mixed with Burnout 2. The features are definitely missing, which is disappointing. I think that because the different vehicles all have different game play styles it's easier to get over the lack of features. Every vehicle is different on every track.\n\nOnline is a blast, theres no doubt about that. Though I wish evolution took some notes from Resistance in the online features. It's kinda hard to meet up with a friend unlike R:FoM. But once you do it's really fun. Theres a few of options when your the server mod, like changing vehicles allowed, and even the time of day can have an effect on game play. But it would of been nice to mute a player's mic like mentioned above.\n\nI'm interested in the new stuff they plan to add. Though I'll be disappointed if they charge for new modes, which I feel should be free. I have no problem paying for tracks and maybe new vehicles but modes that should of been included in the game should definitely be free. They never specified what they are going to do, just that some things will be free, and others will be payable. And if the immersion stuff they talked about on the PSINext podcast comes through, I'll have to finally get that G25 Logitech wheel. Which should be crazy if that works out.\n\nToday:\n\n5:45pm Was out getting dinner with friends and mentioned motorstorm came out. Friend A is delighted and Friend B says he'd prefer to play F1 for the umpteenth time. I decide to pick the game up so we can check it out when we get back home.\n\n8:45pm I sell back Motorstorm for a loss of 37 dollars and purchase Formula 1.\n\nWhat happened in those three hours? I attempted to playonline for 30 minutes to not avail. I played the single player mode for about 1 hour. That was enough to uncover a bevy of glaring faults. As in, \"oh you did not just charge me 60 dollars for this horse shit\" faults. The saddest part is that at it's core, Motorstorm has some really excellent gamplay.\n\nOn the upside, F1 is amazing.\n\nJust wondering, what kind of faults did you experience while playing? I can understand the lack of modes, which I have a problem with as well. But I have been having a blast with the single player and unlocking cars to play in multiplayer. The lack of tracks is not that big of a deal since I've put in plenty of hours into the game and still have not mastered one track; except maybe for the track we got back in the November demo. I definitely feel I got my 60 dollars worth. Hopefully those new modes they have planned are free.\n\nI find it interesting since Motorstorm seems to have been getting better reviews than F1. I plan on getting both but I'm putting off F1 for a few weeks until I save up for the G25.\n\nOT: Some of the F1 reviews I read seem to be suggesting that purists will love this F1 game but they still gave it mediocre scores.\n\nYeah thats what I'm hearing from the people who have played it. Some reviewers seemed to have never turned the assists off or never turned them on.\n\nAnyways..I saw this was worth posting, from gaf:\n\npainey@gaf said:\n\nI just watched the UK gamer.tv special on motorstorm.. looked fantastic, they showed the game, developers gave hints on how to use each car/bike, told how the guys wifes who had never played a game before got hooked using the SIXAXIS control and then a dev even proved that it is possible to play using only motion (gamer.tv were sceptical :lol)\n\nthey also announced new modes and stuff, not sure if it is exclusive info but here is what they said;\n\nNew Tracks: Enclosed Arenas (think demolition derby) and all tracks available in reserve (ala ridge racer)\n\nNew Mode: Barrels of Fun - an arena full of explosive barrels.. try and survive\n\nNew Mode: Bring down the Rig - 11 Humans on motorbikes vs 1 Human in a Big Rig. The bikes have to blow up the Big Rig before it finishes the race/time limit runs out.\n\nNew Mode: WIP [Unnamed] - Opposite of Bring Down the Rig, 1 human in a Big Rig must eliminate 11 Humans on motorbikes before they finish the race.\n\nThey also said they would support Motorstorm with new cars, tracks, modes, etc for 12 months after its release.\n\nAdditional to that are the new modes we knew about already that are coming soon. (Time Trials & Elimination). Some videos of those modes are already on Gamespot.\n\nHopefully these items are priced well and/or free."
