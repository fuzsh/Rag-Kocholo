Such events are common to see when playing online, however events of this type are not restricted to online play.\n\nMutliplayer oriented events[]\n\nKill The Buggy\n\nBackwards race - racing on reversed tracks\n\nDemolition Derby\n\nSingle-player oriented events[]\n\nAI smash - The player drives backwards and attempts to wreck as many forward-driving AI as possible without wrecking themselves.\n\nFree-roam - The player, instead of racing, simply explores a track with no intention of racing.\n\nGuardian Angel - The player races in eliminator attempting to not only come in first, but to aid a certain ai to come in second as well.\n\nTournament - The most complicated game mode (performed in MSPR), the player races for 4-100 full-grid races/eliminators, keeping track of the position they come in for each race as well as the position for each color of AI name tags. Once the tournament ends the results are calculated."
