        "text": "Sony Computer Entertainment America Inc. announced today the North American release of MotorStorm™, available exclusively for the PLAYSTATION®3 (PS3™) computer entertainment system. Developed by Evolution Studios, the acclaimed development team renowned for their World Rally Championship (WRC) game series, MotorStorm introduces players to an alternative and extreme off-road racing festival where the only rule is to take out the competition and win at all costs.\n\nRecently launched in Japan, MotorStorm has incorporated numerous graphical and gameplay enhancements for the North American version, including the addition of a 12-player online mode. The game also features innovations such as real-time track deformation, where ruts in the track will remain and cause each lap to be different, an aggressive artificial intelligence (A.I.) system that scales to the player's abilities, and spectacular crash sequences that take full advantage of the PS3 hardware, making MotorStorm one of the most anticipated next-generation games available.\n\n\"MotorStorm showcases the power and technology of the PS3 with its combination of next-generation online and offline gameplay functionality and life-like A.I.,\" said Jeff Reese, Director, Software Marketing, Sony Computer Entertainment America. \"With over-the-top action, cinematic crashes, and exhilarating gameplay, consumer anticipation for the game has been overwhelming. Not only do we expect thrill seekers to enhance their PS3 library with MotorStorm, we believe the game will ultimately draw more consumers to the PS3.\"\n\nIn MotorStorm, players descend upon the badlands of Monument Valley for the MotorStorm Festival to celebrate an alternative racing culture. The festival is highlighted by a no-holds-barred off-road race with aggressive and competitive opponents all gunning for the championship title. Players will cut through mud paths, speed over sand dunes, and launch across rocky cliffs in an extreme race to the finish line, all of which is underscored by a rocking soundtrack. The competition is fierce and it's a survival of the fittest with MotorStorm's combat-like racing. The physics-based car damage feature heightens the challenge, allowing for any of the seven vehicle types to break and destroy parts upon collisions with other racers. A real-time track deformation function has been implemented so that after each lap raced the terrain will look and handle differently, ensuring players will never face the same lap twice.\n\nHarnessing the power of the PS3, MotorStorm features remarkable player-centric A.I. that reacts to numerous situations within the game, such as realistically reacting to player taunts, seeking out the best routes based on vehicle type used, and changing the level of driving aggression due to player actions. The advanced cinematic effects such as motion-blur and slow motion Hollywood style \"crash cams\" make wiping out in your vehicle nearly more exciting than finishing the lap.\n\nFeaturing a compilation of tracks from some of the most popular rock bands, the MotorStorm in-game soundtrack accentuates the game's brutal off-road mayhem, providing players the ideal background music to get in the mood for complete destruction and cutthroat competition. The soundtrack features heart-pounding rock anthems sure to raise the game's intensity level by artists such as Primal Scream, Queens of the Stone Age, Nirvana, Slipknot, and more.\n\nMotorStorm gained critical acclaim at the 2006 E3 show, earning IGN's 2006 E3 award for \"Best Racing Game\" and GameSpot's Editor's Choice Award for \"Best Racing Game.\" The game also earned 1UP's \"Best of Show\" award from TGS 2006.\n\nThe independent Entertainment Software Rating Board (ESRB) rates MotorStorm \"T\" for \"Teen\" (Descriptors: Language, Violence).
