        "text": "“MotorStorm: Apocalypse” is a smart racer that’s run into some awful luck. Evolution Studios’ latest project was ready for release April 12, but a catastrophic earthquake hit Japan. It was the worst news possible for a game in which players race through a city that’s being destroyed by tremors, storms and other forces of a nature. Given the circumstances, the launch would have been inappropriate.\n\nThe game’s release was delayed to this week, but “MotorStorm: Apocalypse” was again hit with a double whammy of misfortune when deadly tornadoes struck the South and the PlayStation Network went offline. The former was another case of bad timing for a game that features a destructive whirlwind in a racetrack, and the latter incident could cause irreparable harm to Sony’s reputation. The security breach that led to the shutdown of Sony’s online service also means that a key part of the game isn’t functional at its launch.\n\nEvolution Studios can’t get a break, and that’s a shame because “MotorStorm: Apocalypse” is a good arcade racer. It’s an entry that breaks new ground. The original took place atop desert mesas, the sequel was held on a tropical island and a PlayStation Portable spinoff centered on the Arctic. But in “MotorStorm: Apocalypse,” the developer brings city street racing to the series in its own special way.\n\nOn aircraft carrier\n\nThis time, the MotorStorm Festival, the touring event at the heart of the series, begins aboard a commandeered aircraft carrier. The organizers, Big Dog and Ms. Austin, take the vessel to a city on the verge of a cataclysm. Most of its residents have been evacuated and the only people left are the Crazies, who stayed behind, and Dusklite mercenaries, who are charged with protecting the rich residents’ belongings.\n\nAmid this environment, players will take on the role of three characters — Mash (a rookie), Tyler (a pro) and Big Dog (a veteran). These are also the three sections of the single-player campaigns that tell different stories from the two-day festival.\n\nThey introduce players to the gameplay starting off from easy (Mash) to hard (Big Dog). For those expecting courses that go around in circles, they’ll be surprised about the twists and turns in this race.\n\n“MotorStorm” has always been known for courses that have multiple paths and controls that offer a risk and reward with boosts. Players can speed up in short spurts, but they have to be careful because if they boost too long, their vehicle will explode. Of course, there are mitigating factors. If players drive through large puddles, it’ll cool the hypercharged engine. If they drive through fire, it’ll heat up the vehicle making it more likely to burst into flames. Racers will have to balance this gameplay wrinkle with vehicles — ATV, big rigs, buggys, supercars, motorcycles and monster trucks — that each handle differently.\n\nEvolving tracks\n\nThe big change comes from the constantly evolving tracks. Players will be zooming through streets, rooftops and alleyways, and through this all, the temblors will rip fissures in the earth, high winds will toss boats across boardwalks, high-rises will topple over. There are also looters and mercenaries that impede or fire on racers.\n\nThe structural changes remind me of Black Rock Studio’s underrated “Split/Second.” Visually, “MotorStorm: Apocalypse” isn’t as impressive, but it’s nonetheless astounding to see the dynamic destruction of a race, where every lap is different. The ground splits open creating makeshift obstacles that can wreck rivals. Gas tankers and buses will turn into flying missiles. Short cuts may end up blocked off by landslides.\n\nAmid these obstacles, players will fend off competitors in a free-for-all. For speedy motorcyclists with little protection, that means avoiding big rigs that could crush them. For supercars, that means staying on asphalt and away from mud that slows drivers down.\n\nIn terms of modes, players will have the conventional race with up to 16 competitors. There’s a survival mode where the last-place racer is eliminated after intervals a few seconds long. Finally, players have a timed run, where they have to make it out of the city within a time limit.\n\nSadly, the PlayStation Network was still down as of Wednesday morning, and I couldn’t access the more interesting parts of “MotorStorm: Apocalypse.” The online competition with its perks, vehicles and betting system promised a fresher experience than the single-player. I’ll post on my blog about that part of the game when PSN is restored later this week."
