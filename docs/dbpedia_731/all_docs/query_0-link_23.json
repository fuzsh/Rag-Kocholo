        "text": "Update: Sony has confirmed that there will be no LAN option for MotorStorm. Therefore, the game mode that we were participating in was being hosted in the UK and the code was review-quality. Therefore, the lag experienced can be explained by the distance involved.\n\nThe PlayStation 3 is still striving for the definitive killer app to be released. It's a common quandary of a new console. Thankfully the PS3 is launching with several \"great-ish\" titles; while they're not necessarily killer, only a fool would discount their potential for enjoyable time-wasting. MotorStorm is shaping up to be one of these great titles, and who knows, with a little polish could even turn into a killer.\n\nThere are times when getting our games six months after the rest of the planet isn't such a bad thing. While we can count those times on the hand of a (giant) crab, MotorStorm is one such title. Pity the poor Japanese, where MotorStorm was released as a rush-job, missing one of the most crucial features expected in a racer.\n\nHow dare they release a racer without any form of multiplayer whatsoever. Imagine - a PS3 racing title with a clear emphasis on down-and-dirty, car-versus-bike-versus-truck mayhem, and no opportunity to play against a real opponent - split-screen or otherwise. That, friends, is an almost unforgivable blunder. But, thanks to our location at the arse-end of the Earth, we're getting a later version of the game, now with online multiplayer. This is why we were so keen to get hands-on with a fresh, complete build.\n\nSo, how was it? First of all, if you've either played the NTSC version or seen the videos, you'll have a good idea of how the racing mechanics in MotorStorm work. You choose a class of vehicle, a model and a track to compete on - much like the single player mode. However, all of this hinges around the multiplayer game lobby, where you can host a game, customise settings and invite other players into the match. This is the process when connecting the PS3s to an overseas host, as was the case for our test.\n\nOnce one of the players chooses their vehicle, a countdown timer commences, giving you mere seconds to finalise your selection. Then, it's into the race - such as it is, since the sense of speed is surprisingly lacking.\n\nThere is a definite learning curve that is hidden behind the deceptively simple control scheme. Using the right trigger to accelerate and the left to brake, and throwing in a boost gauge into the mix might not sound like the formula for absolute racing bliss - and for the most part, it isn't. Of course, there is more to MotorStorm than simply racing; there's more going on than just darting around a circuit. In reality, in a way reminiscent of Wave Race 64 back in the day, the key to success lies in mastering your balance, rotation and landing. Taking advantage of the environment to give you a momentary lead can mean the difference between a successful overtake and a spectacular dismantling crash.\n\nProvided you don't bother with the motion-based control option, the mechanics are mostly responsive and after learning to compensate for outside factors, such as physics, inertia and Cam's repetitive smashing into the rear of our buggy, things become second nature. Given that some of our competitors had never played the title before, reactions to the controls and physics were mixed; it also caused frustration for some, since regular players of GTA and Burnout suddenly found themselves losing. Badly.\n\nAccording to Sony, the build we were playing was review PAL code, with the server hosted in the UK. This was not immediately clear to us, which accounts for confusion over the set-up. With eight players, the network performance definitely took a hit, with occassional lag and teleporting - not too surprising considering we were playing on a server halfway around the world. We're not overly concerned, since many games experience teething problems early on when dealing with online infrastructure, and playing on local servers should lead to a less warp-tastic experience. As it stands, we think hosting a game in the UK and inviting 8 players is asking for trouble, but under normal circumstances with fewer players and a local host with a high-speed connection, we hope lag will be less of an issue.\n\nOf course, this isn't a review, though, and we will keep our fingers and toes crossed that this issue is resolved in time for release, especially considering network code is usually one of the last parts of a game to get the final lick of developer love."
