        "text": "I've always had a soft spot for this series so I took the plunge. The game itself is just fine and having the course constantly change on you certainly pumps up the adrenaline. Courses themselves are also pretty inventive, including one along the tops of skyscrapers. Just ignore their attempt to shoehorn some kind of plot into it by inserting awful motion comics.\n\nHowever I'm not here to praise the game. I'm here to question the developer's sanity in making all vehicle and parts unlocks multiplayer only. Seriously WTF? Aside from local co-op, I don't think I've ever played online multiplayer in either the original or Pacific Rift. Those games had most vehicles unlockable via single player. Given that the game is pulled from Japan and have always been sort of low key, I doubt the online population is going to be large enough to sustain the kind of complicated unlocking scheme they got (not enough to just win races, you have to fulfill specific conditions). It's not hard to imagine someone getting this cheap couple years down the line and finding it impossible to unlock anything.\n\nTL,DR: Any attempt to force singleplayer er, players to play multiplayer is just stupid.\n\nIn general, I'm annoyed when games that offer multiple modes of play contain unlocks applicable to a mode of play not unlockable by playing in that mode. Having to play multiplayer to get the content I want for single player play, or single player play for content I want for multiplayer sucks, especially since I frequently have zero interest in one mode or the other. Occasionally, even requiring online play when the game offers local multiplayer that's identical to the online play. Bleh.\n\nFighting games are probably the most common offender, although less frequently so of late. Racing games pretty commonly, too. Party games that you have to play the single player mode to unlock more play modes for are probably the most stupidly designed offender: not only does the single player mode typically suck for them, and most people aren't buying them for the single player mode, but by making a player play through them alone you're pretty much ensuring a worse play experience when they are played multiplayer in a \"party game\" setting because the player that unlocked everything will have a big skill advantage over people without experience in the games.\n\nYou could probably extend the conversation to badly designed unlock systems in general. Being tedious, obscure, or poorly paced are probably the most common failings. I bear a special loathing for games where you unlock stuff in multiplayer by doing things that are a bad way to play the game. Challenging or goofy unlock challenges in single player are cool, but incentivizing players to play poorly in a team game where the rest of their team may be playing to win is not.\n\nThere's not a one true way to approach unlocks, and what is a good unlock system is to some extent going to be subjective, but there's definitely well designed systems and poorly designed ones. My favorite unlock system is probably Super Smash Brothers Melee. Pretty much everything could be unlocked in multiple ways that supported different playstyles- including simply eventually unlocking everything by sheer time played."
