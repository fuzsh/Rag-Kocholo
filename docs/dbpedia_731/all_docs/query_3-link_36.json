        "text": "I haven't touched the online part yet, just making my way through the single player tracks and loving every minute of it. I specifically like the way individual tracks can play differently each time. Especially with atmospheric effects such as lighting, darkness, angle of the sun, vehicle type etc.\n\nThe AI I find to be exceptional, and they will take risks to take you out if you annoy them. Seen some spectacular crashes.\n\nI dont normally give 10/10 to anything but Motorstorm has exceeded all my expectations from E3 '05!\n\nOh and the other essential part - it is sooooooo much fun to play! When pausing a crash and using the thumbsticks to pan the camera the detail you can see is amazing.\n\nI'm very much into serious racing games like gtr on the pc, but this game is great fun. Infact it's getting the most play time on the ps3 at the moment. I'm having alot more fun than I ever did with pgr3. Haven't tried playing online yet but may try that soon. Oh and some of the graphics in this game are stunning I'd give this a 7 out of 10. I can't see me playing this game a few months down the line, if online play goes ok for me then it will no doubt extend the longevity.\n\n8 out of 10 for me.\n\nGreat physics, good laugh playing but no where near enough content to keep me happy and a **** poor online implementation hold this game way back from its potential, which tbh is just annoying more than anything else.\n\nWill stick to what i said in the motorstorm thread that it just feels like a tech demo that went better than expected so sony pushed them to make a retail game out of it hence why its lacking in so many features.\n\nThanks for summing up my thoughts. I would give it a 7 out of 10. Looks great, nice physics. Not enough to keep me interested or to be a classic. I am having more fun with GT:HD anyway.\n\nIt's a very solid 9 from me. Love the game! Every race has something unique happen and it's constantly great fun. Graphically it's fantastic with spawling landscapes and superbly detailed vehicles. No pop up or slow down that I have noticed and the lighting is great giving the whole thing a realistic look. The physics on the cars is the best i've ever seen in a racing game and they always seem to react just right with the environment. The cars also seem fully part of the world as they cut into the mud and sand and you never get the feeling that the vehicles are floating over the landscape like you do in some racing games.\n\nIt's a bit lacking in modes, but the 1 player is keeping me occupied and i've not even got round to trying multiplayer yet. That said, we're in the middle of a house move so time has been limited.\n\nIn summary - one of the best launch games ever and one of the most enjoyable racers i've ever played. It kind of gives me the best from some my fave racers of the past - Stunt Car Racer, Enduro Racer, Power Drift, Buggy Boy and Burnout 2 and wraps it all up in a great looking and sounding title. It's ridiculously loud though and where as my Amp is usually on 9 or 10, this game has me set it to around 5 or 6! If the game had a split screen mode and perhaps some more depth to the single player game (i.e. say a more open ended Gran Turismo style game with money from winning races that can be used to upgrade or buy new vehicles) then it would have got 10 easy, as it is I can't bring myself to give it less than 9.\n\nI give it 8 out of 10. Its a very good game, the online play is not as good as it might have been (Lobby system in particular) so it losses a point for that.\n\nAlso no split screen. Other than that a very solid launch title. The graphics are fantastic, its ones of the best racing games I have played on a console.\n\nThere is only this and resitance worth having for me at the moment...I am not sure why people are loving GT HD. Its so unplayable, I cant class it as fun. I mean it really is awful am I missing something ?\n\nI give it 8 out of 10.

Its so unplayable, I cant class it as fun. I mean it really is awful am I missing something ?\n\nI really like GTHD and find it very playable indeed. What don't you like about it? The cars control well and have pretty decent physics, graphically it's very nice indeed and there's a nice range of cars to play with.\n\nOn the other hand, I played the Resistance demo and it did nothing for me at all. Tekken 5 R is good and Lemmings is as good fun as it ever was.\n\nGoing back to Motorstorm though - just watching some of the extra's and the ariel video's are just stunning and look real! Some of the best HD images i've seen.\n\nGraphically GTHD was OK but I couldnt believe how badly the cars handled in it . Also no vehicle damage and no interaction with the scenery. I just thought it was really really poor. But then again its a demo and free so I suppose I shouldnt complain.\n\nI agree that the scenery interaction is poor and there's no damage, but I like the handling of the cars. Once you get used to it you can really start throwing the cars around and it's great fun. Considering it's just the GT4 engine with some tarted up graphics I think it holds up very well. The fact that you can drive into a bit of tape round the track and it reacts like you've hit a brick wall has always been a bug bear of the GT series with me though. GT5 will have to address that, the issue of car damage and have a great online game if it wants to be taken seriously along side Forza 2. I personally see GT5 being superb though and can't wait for it.\n\nI gave this game 7/10.\n\nIn the graphics department the PS3 could hardly have hoped for a better showcase game to launch with but it is far from niggle and annoyance free.\n\nThe most frustrating element I find if the continued enforcement of one type of vehicle per race, despite the competition having free choice, which rather than giving you an incentive to try and find optimum routes for that type just annoys me.\n\nWhen you crash there should be some mechanism to restart quickly because sometimes you can go from first to last place because it's rolling over a hill slowly or such like.\n\nNot a fan of the music either (which has always been a Playstation failing) and until developers start to incorporate the ability for custom soundtracks this will continue to be an annoyance factor for me and detract from the games.\n\nMy online experiences have not been pretty. Unable to get on European servers for some reason and so have to select Australian lobbies. When you do get into a Lobby it's been time after time waiting 5+ minutes for someone to start it in relative silence (at least with Live you could request the host (politely) if they are ever going to start the game).\n\nOverall a good game, very good... but not perfect.\n\nI would love to give it 9/10 as it is great fun but not having split screen is an issue and so is the lack of tracks / cars. It really gives you the idea that they rushed it out, almost like a half completed game. Remember what PGR1 was like compared to PGR2.\n\nHowever i do really love the insane completely stupid physics nature of the game. I take games like gt / pgr3 very seriously and so its nice to have a game you can just let some steam off with. If it was an arcade game, with a wheel and moving chair it would be seriously good, especially as number of tracks/options aren't so important in a arcade machine.\n\nI give it 7.5/10, could be great but needs a little more polish. Bring on Motorstorm 2.\n\nGraphically GTHD was OK but I couldnt believe how badly the cars handled in it . Also no vehicle damage and no interaction with the scenery. I just thought it was really really poor. But then again its a demo and free so I suppose I shouldnt complain.\n\nWho cares about vehicle damage, in the real world if you crash a car it race over. Simple solution don't crash.\n\nAs the handling make sure you have all the drivers aids turned off. I have driven a few of these cars in real life (okay not in anger) and i think the handling appears to be pretty much spot on."
