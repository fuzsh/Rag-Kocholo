Nice balance of realism and arcade. I have not found a game to scratch those itches. Forza Horizon might have done it if not for open world.\n\nOct 2, 2020\n\n#24\n\nI need more Wipeout and Ridge Racer (classic) in my life.\n\nRosebud\n\nTwo Pieces\n\nApr 16, 2018\n\n46,170\n\nOct 2, 2020\n\n#25\n\nThere are some nice indie arcade racers this gen\n\nPatitoloco\n\nOct 27, 2017\n\n24,239\n\nOct 2, 2020\n\n#27\n\nI miss midnight club\n\nHell yeah!

You can really tell it's from the pedigree that made the stellar Sonic & All-Stars Racing Transformed, which still holds up extremely well. We need more racing games like that.\n\nSumo Digital makes amazing arcade racing games, but they absolutely need the time, budget and direction to produce nice and meaty ones.\n\nGeezer\n\nJan 29, 2018\n\n289\n\nOct 2, 2020\n\n#30\n\nNo, OP, you are not. I loved MSR on the Dreamcast and it's spiritual successor PGR on the original Xbox.\n\nI associate Ridge Racer with Playstation so strongly that the lack of a Ridge Racer on PS4 is one of the most disappointing things of this generation. I was hoping Namco would release a Ridge Racer game for PS5/Series X but we shouldn't hold our breath for that.\n\nkdoll08\n\nOct 25, 2017\n\n463\n\nOct 2, 2020\n\n#31\n\nI miss Ridge Racer and the Sega Arcade racers so much. It is a shame the last Ridge Racer was on Vita and was really lacking in single player content.\n\ndodo667418\n\nKnights of Favonius World Tour '21\n\nOct 28, 2017\n\n1,716\n\nOct 2, 2020\n\n#32\n\nAbsolutely. The Motorstorm games were so good. Pacific Rift was one of my favorite games last gen. The original game was also so much fun. The things I'd do for a PS5 remaster trilogy...\n\nDriveclub was great as well. The launch was botched, but after a couple of weeks it was a good experience, loved the driving physics.\n\nThankfully we still have the Forza Horizon series. 3 in particular was a blast, Australia was so well done. 4 is also really good, still playing it every now and then. And thankfully we also still have Codemasters, I usually love their games. Looking forward to Dirt 5.\n\nEdit: Yeah Midnight Club was also super fun. I remember just driving around Los Angeles for hours. The city was super well done and the soundtrack was a bop. It's a shame they probably won't do another one because it doesn't print money like GTA does.\n\nEdit2: Yeah also Split Second. We had some incredible racing games last gen. I also just remembered FUEL and Nail'd, also very fun experiences.\n\nLast edited: Oct 2, 2020\n\nOct 2, 2020\n\n#33\n\nI am looking forward to Dirt 5 and the next Forza.\n\nLiK\n\nOct 25, 2017\n\n32,755\n\nWaggles\n\nOct 26, 2017\n\n3,344\n\nOct 2, 2020\n\n#35\n\nMy god, yes.\n\nthe closest we get is the Forza Horizon series, and that just ain't it.

Dirt uses fictional cars, right?\n\nNope, these are the ones confirmed so far: https://www.google.com/search?q=Dir...me..69i57l2.2022j0j7&sourceid=chrome&ie=UTF-8\n\nentremet\n\nYou wouldn't toast a NES cartridge\n\nOct 26, 2017\n\n63,700\n\nOct 2, 2020\n\n#44\n\nThey exist in the indie space these days. The ROI is not there for the big publishers.\n\nType VII\n\nOct 31, 2017\n\n2,426\n\nOct 2, 2020\n\n#45\n\nGive Hotshot Racing, Horizon Chase Turbo, Inertial Drift and Pacer a look.\n\n2Blackcats\n\nOct 26, 2017\n\n16,522\n\nOct 2, 2020\n\n#46\n\nI still play them. Probably some classics I've missed that I should pick up\n\nHero Prinny\n\nOct 25, 2017\n\n3,311\n\nOct 2, 2020\n\n#47\n\nMotorstorm was and stil is one of my favorite arcade racers. Unpopular opinion but Apocalypse is my favorite one. Every race felt like something straight out of a blockbuster action film. I really wish we got a sequel or something\n\nOct 2, 2020\n\n#48\n\nFor me, only Motorstorm.\n\nI suck at all of the other racers. All of them.\n\nBring back Motorstorm. I was a beast in it.\n\nOct 2, 2020\n\n#49\n\nRidge Racer 8 is probably my most dreamed about game. It's still pretty mindboggling to me that Ridge Racer 7 was 1080p & 60 FPS given the... extreme lack of that on the PS3 and shit, even the current generation of stuff. The PSP games are excellent. I know the market has changed a ton, but honestly even an \"AA\" level Ridge would be stupidly exciting.\n\nAnyway, I have a massive thing for racers from the late 90s/early 2000s. I don't think we'll ever really get a ton of new games in that genre from any of the old studios, but I'd flip out for being able to play WaveRace 64 on my Switch, and getting more home ports of Sega racers the quality of Daytona HD. Give me Daytona 2 & Scud Race you cowards."
