        "text": "An official Motorstorm 2 Teaser Trailer will be released exclusively on IGN at 6pm GMT today... EDIT - Its out!\n\nLink -http://uk.ps3.ign.com/articles/858/858851p1.html\n\nIt has been confirmed that it will be CGI (like the originals first trailer) but will hopefully show some stuff that the dev's are hoping to improve on.\n\nSo stay tuned ... only another half an hour, just hope its more realistic than Motorstorm's original CGI trailer where in the end, although great, the game didn't look anything like it!\n\nRobin\n\nIGNUK\n\nMore MotorStorm Cometh\n\nIGN unleashing first teaser trailer of Sony's tropics-bound MotorStorm sequel today.\n\nUK, March 12, 2008 - You probably think you already know about MotorStorm 2 if you've been following the torrent of information leaks springing forth from the internet over the last couple of weeks.\n\nHere's what you should definitely know though: if you swing by IGN later on today at 6pm GMT, you can feast your eyes on the first MotorStorm 2 teaser trailer. Despite some haggling, Sony adamantly refused to let us spoil the surprise and give you a sneak-peak at the game so you'll just have to believe us when we say it has the potential to blow your socks clean off your lower appendages.\n\nSo far, it's been revealed that MotorStorm 2 does away with the barren desert landscapes of the first game, replacing all that brown with lush vegetation in a tropical island setting. It features water hazards, destructible scenery and monster trucks.\n\nFinally, online play is rumoured to be complemented by four-player split-screen race-offs, which is always nice in a retro sort of way.\n\nSo, just to recap, that's 6pm GMT, today, Wednesday March 12. Be there or be completely indifferent.\n\nAnd this trailer looks good, but the teaser for the first Motorstorm looks better. Hehe.\n\nI kinda agree, the first one was a lot more brutal, I do like the nod at the end in this one to the original where it ends with someone about to get squished!\n\nBut this time I hope its a more accurate representation of the trailer because Motorstorm kind of let me down when I saw it after seeing CGI...\n\nRobin\n\nI was just reading up on Motorstorm 2 Pacific Rift on Sony Playstations official website and was reading up on some information. One of which grabbed my intrest...alot.\n\nKey Features:\n\n* The Island - A brand new radically different location for the festival.\n\n* Unpredictable Events - Never the same race twice. Events will take place to change the race on a lap to lap basis.\n\n* Split Screen Play - Play with up to 3 buddies on the same screen.\n\n* The Monster Truck - An all new vehicle class added to the core vehicle selection for a total of 8 different vehicle classes.\n\n* Immersive Online Experience  A radical re-look at the whole MotorStorm online experience, focusing on ease of use and breadth of gameplay all while tearing it up in races up to 16 players.\n\n* Improved Actions - A new level of control; punch, duck and ram using a new control layout.\n\n* Free-play - Race how you want by creating your own race tickets.\n\n* Photo Mode - Snap your greatest victory or your most visceral crashes and share them with the world.\n\n* New Rating Systems - Its not all about winning; its also about how you perform.\n\nPhotomode. That is awesome, I really want this game now. Just imagine what kind of photos you would be able to get....\n\nSource\n\nThat Trailor looked like another \"This CGI and will be nothing like it, but it will be boringggg...\" lol.\n\nThe fact that Motorstorm (the original) was graphically brilliant is besides the point then?\n\nI personally think the graphics will be up to scratch by the time its released, from the 40% complete run throughs I've seen it looks pretty good now. Also seeing splitscreen up and running in the 40% run throughs were great. Now we just to have more content than the original."
