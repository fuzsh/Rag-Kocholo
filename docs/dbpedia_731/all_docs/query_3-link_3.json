I have GT Sport and I liked doing the driving school and missions but the other solo content seems kinda drab. Have Forza Horizon 3 and it's fun but it doesn't really have a good solo campaign either. I've got more sick cars than I know what to do with and it's just kinda driving to events and doing enough stuff to unlock a new outpost or whatever they're called.\n\nLooking more for something with progression like Midnight Club LA I guess. I remember starting in a Golf then at the end of the game I'm doing 200+ on these Kawasaki Ninjas. Man that game was awesome. What is your favorite?\n\nReally been in the mood for some good racing lately but I honestly don't play much multiplayer these days.

I remember starting in a Golf then at the end of the game I'm doing 200+ on these Kawasaki Ninjas. Man that game was awesome. What is your favorite?\n\nTry the Hot Wheels expansion, I liked their Campaign better (and it's shorter).\n\nThere are very few that I care for at all to be honest but the standout one is GRID. In the game's Career Mode you got to compete across a whole range of disciplines while building a racing team. To have a game that did street racing, and track racing, and Touge, and destruction derby, and day-night-day multi-class Le Mans 24 Hours so well... It's so refreshing compared to the ridiculously contrived stories in however many arcade racing games (Dirt, Need for Speed, Forza Horizon etc) or the straight laced approaches of other games (Gran Turismo, Forza Motorsport, Driveclub etc).\n\nGRID was actually a really formative experience for me as someone that was primarily into Gran Turismo/Forza Motorsport at the time. It made me realise what I cared about most in a racing game (racing) and it helped me realise how few racing games actually make it their primary focus. It's why I was immediately on board with the concept of Gran Turismo Sport and why it, Dirt Rally, and games on the other end of the arcade-sim spectrum like Wipeout and Mario Kart are my favourite racers this generation.\n\nI was going to say Gt Legends but Geoff Crammonds GP3 take it.\n\nIf I remember correctly their F1 license was out of date but that meant they could Sim the results and times of the 97/98 season.\n\nI'm not really fussy when it comes to career modes or any of that bs in a racing game. Just make it fun and give me a few options and I'm sound.\n\nSaying that Toca race Driver 2 wasn't bad with its story mode but there was nothing that stood out and made me think, \"need more story in my racers\"."
