        "text": "MotorStorm: Apocalypse is the third major title in the PlayStation 3 exclusive MotorStorm series, and it promises to shake up the series with new mechanics and a fresh setting. While the previous entries were focused on off-road racing, Apocalypse takes the action into a destroyed city, which also introduces a dynamic element to the competition. Thanks to the track deformation and other events that occur during the race, there is a lot of variety to be had here. The controls are still somewhat unique and require getting used to, as there are 13 different vehicle classes to choose from. Though it borrows some elements from other racers, MotorStorm: Apocalypse makes up with polish what it lacks in originality.\n\nApocalypse is a more story-driven experience than previous installments. At the core of the game’s single player is the Festival mode, which tells the story of a competition that spans two days. The narrative is told from the perspective of three participants in the Festival, named Mash \"The Rookie\", Tyler \"The Pro\", and Big Dog \"The Veteran”. As such, players get to experience the same Festival from three different view points, all intertwined and eventually leading to an overall conclusion. Needless to say, the story is very simplistic and with extremely basic dialog. It serves as nothing more than a way to string races together, but it’s better than navigating a menu.\n\nAs mentioned, this is the first MotorStorm title to take place in an urban setting. Though the series has always been about offroad racing, this new locale doesn’t stop the game from showcasing its signature racing style and intensity. The ‘Stormers arrive to the dock of a collapsing city that continues to crumble through the campaign, which is also home to two warring factions of humans. These two human factions are also a new element to the series, which introduces a new element to the game. The races sometimes take place in the heat of battle between the two sides, causing additional mayhem and even adding to the car’s heat meter, thus introducing additional challenge to the racers.\n\nBut of course, the big feature of the game is track deformation. If you’ve played last year’s Split/Second, then things won’t be too surprising here. However, what Apocalypse may lack in originating the idea, it more than makes up for with stylish presentation and polish. The destruction seen in the game is on a much grander scale than anything else you’ve seen before, and it’s presented with enough finesse to really make an impression. Buildings collapse, the already-deformed streets crumble even further, producing new routes and obstacles. The races are also intelligently designed – most are for 3 or 4 laps, and the real changes don’t start occurring until the last lap. This throws a real curve ball, as the track you’ve learned after the first couple of laps becomes almost unrecognizable.\n\nThe level of destruction seen in the game allows the box to boast over 40 tracks, while in reality there are around 12 or 15 – with quite a number of variations between them based on time of day and destruction that is occurring. It’s clever design, offering more bang for essentially the same track. Sadly, the game suffers from much the same problems as Split/Second – once you’ve completed a track, there are no further surprises to see. You’ll know exactly what happens during the destruction sequence and what the newly deformed track will look like. Also, during the destructive events, the track will deform in very intrusive ways, causing you to crash frequently as new obstacles appear.\n\nThankfully, due to balanced respawn times, this isn’t much of a problem. Much like Burnout, the MotorStorm franchise has a heavy focus on crashing into your opponents, with controller buttons dedicated to smashing others. Because of this, the game has a very balanced respawn system that allows you to crash a number of times, but still be in the running for a podium finish. Similarly, the AI opponents often crash by themselves or with “help” from the player, but remain competitive. The driving physics feel like classic MotorStorm, which means they are arcade-based but have strong drifting and can get some time to get used to – especially on bikes.\n\nThere is a somewhat major problem with the AI races, and it is that they seem scripted – there is little hope for the player to be leading within the first lap. However, as the race winds down to the end, you’ll miraculously catch up and often surpass your opponents to snag a first place finish. It doesn’t seem to matter which difficulty you’re playing at, driving perfectly or recklessly. It’s a predictable pattern that occurs through the single player campaign races. On a more positive note, the game has a few special races that are story-based, and on a timer rather than against other racers. Missions such as escaping an oncoming earthquake are a thrill, and also provide a good break from the regular competition.\n\nThere is a diverse number of vehicles in the game, 13 in total, which include supercars, superbikes, hot hatches, muscle cars and choppers as new to the series. All of the vehicles handle with noticeable differences, and have varying acceleration and speeds. Unfortunately, these differences can only be estimated in the game by the type of vehicle, as there are no stats to compare or view. So for example, big rigs are slow movers but can take out any opponents unlucky enough to be nearby, whereas bikes are quick and agile but are easy to crash. All of the cars in the game come with an impressive variety of customization options, from vinyls and stickers to bumpers and headlights, allowing for very unique looking cars.\n\nThe game also features a variety of multiplayer options. Players can do quick races online in either chase or eliminator modes, with offline split-screen. When going online, the game supports large lobbies that encourages player voting for the next track. There is also a unique betting system, which lets players bet either on themselves or against those who they think they can beat in a race. This earns you extra credits towards leveling up, which itself unlocks new items and perks. Players can select up to 4 perks, which range from extra damage during crashes, boosts of speed, higher engine heat threshold, and others. As more are unlocked, it can become a very strategic decision on what loadout to bring in each race.\n\nSadly, it has to be said that MotorStorm: Apocalypse suffered from a perfect storm of bad luck (no pun intended). The game was released in Europe in March, with the release in North America set to follow later, in April, for reasons unknown. Due to the tragedy in Japan, the game’s release was then further delayed to May. In yet another occurance, the PSN has been down for over 3 weeks between April and May, which is when Apocalypse was released. Now that game’s finally out, there seems to be very little interest – an effect best seen in empty online lobbies, and that’s unlikely to change.\n\nApocalypse is uniquely presented, not just because it has a story to follow along with, but also thanks to the interesting graphical style used. The Festival mode progress is presented with comic book style animated cutscenes, which are well drawn and add flavor to the game’s presentation. The in-game graphics are good as well, though sometimes the textures aren’t very sharp. Nonetheless, the destruction often looks great and vehicle damage models are detailed well. The game’s soundtrack is also a standout, with some mixes from DJ Shadow, though the number of songs is lacking.\n\nMotorStorm: Apocalypse is a fitting entry in the PS3-excuslive series that tries to bring something new to the franchise. The game’s main hook – deforming environments – is well designed and implemented, offering exactly what players might expect. The destroyed city is an interesting and unique location that is also immersive thanks to the addition of the ongoing human conflict. The racing is signature MotorStorm style, which means many crashes but also fair respawn timing. Sadly, due to a variety of factors outside of the game’s control, the multiplayer lobbies sit empty just a week after release. Apocalypse is a solid chapter in the MotorStorm franchise that brings something substantially new to the table, and though it may not always be perfectly executed, it’s a well-made racer nonetheless."
