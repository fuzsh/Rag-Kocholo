        "text": "Motorstorm: Pacific Rift is a 2008 game developed by Evolution Studios. It’s the second title in the Motorstorm series, with the original being an ambitious but ultimately flawed launch titles for the PS3. The main issue with the first game is that it was a very pretty arcade racer. No story mode, no advancement of cars or classes, and most importantly no split screen multiplayer. PR not only fixed those issues but did a good enough job that Sony purchased the studio as a result of the games success.\n\nThe ‘Oh Shit’ moment is something everyone has experienced. Maybe only a few times in your life but you have at least felt it. It’s the moment where something some crazy, extreme, nuts, or weird happens that it just makes you yell ‘Oh Shit!’ In games it’s really hard to duplicate this feeling, because you have to draw the player in, in order to really make someone yell like that you have to give them a feeling that what is happening is critical to their success. Motorstorm: Pacific Rift is an entire game that’s entire design is made to make you scream ‘OH SHIT!’ as much as possible.\n\nThis game is hard, I mean really hard, like retardedly hard, I am only on skill level 3 of 8 and it already takes 10 tries to beat a race. I own Demon’s Souls and I am willing to bet that I have bashed my head against the wall more trying to beat Motorstorm then I ever did on Demon’s Souls. But this adds to the overall feel of the game though, they want you to lose, they want you to hate it, they want you to feel as though the slightest mistake means starting over because you pretty much lost the race. If they create that feeling in the player then every jump, every intense ride through the jungle, every win is just going to have such an emotional impact on the player. That’s the success of Motorstorm it makes you really feel every race of the game, my dad was watching me play and was quite literally on the edge of his seat, and I found myself yelling after a close win. Keep in mind that I turn off music when I play racing games because I need to hear the pitch of the motor, in other words I am not an animated video game player, ‘ice’ would be a more accurate description.\n\nThe improvements are what really make this game stand out from the previous entry. All aspects of the game have been improved, first off the graphics, I mean WOW! There is an early shot in the game of the island and then it zooms into a race taking place, and I swore to god I was looking at an actual island. 4 player split screen is an accomplishment as well, much like Killzone 2 this game really shows off the power of the PS3 not so much in what you see in single player but what you see in multiplayer. It shows off the power when you play the game with 3 other people and realize that it can run the game 4 times over. You can have 12 cars on fire jumping over an active volcano with 6 of the guys flying through the air as they get punched off their bikes and you realize the game isn’t struggling or shaking or anything, it’s just running crisp and smooth. There is a tangible career mode now as well, work your way through different events, you unlock bonus cars and paintjobs for getting wins as well as new events.\n\nI think if I had to name one flaw it would be in this career mode, first off some sort of options for upgrading your cars would have made the game so much longer, because right now as your progress your cars don’t get better but your enemies do. From the start your cars stay the same but the enemies go from level 1 to level 8, so what I just have to get that much better? What if like most humans can’t do that? But again it all comes back to the challenge of the game, so you have to wonder if the decision to leave out upgrades was intentional, who knows. Second off and perhaps my biggest problem with the game is locking you into certain car classes. You have classes of cars, ranging from bikes, to rally cars to monster trucks. They give you all the cars very early on, yet every single race has some ridiculous restriction on what cars you can drive, I understand that in time attack mode or check points, but a normal race with no special rules, why the hell can’t I drive what I want? Especially sense the opposing A.I. can drive what they want. It just doesn’t make any sense.\n\nAs it stands this is still a game I would highly recommend picking up, its fun and if you have friends its wayyyyyy more fun. You and everyone around you will spend the majority of the time screaming ‘Oh Shit!’\n\nPeace"
