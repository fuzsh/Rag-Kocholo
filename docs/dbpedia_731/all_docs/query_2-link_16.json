        "text": "[rant]I always love if reviews quantify games by #levels or #hours you need to run straight to the end. Some games I played endlessly were plattformers you could finish in 2 hours.\n\nYes, 2 hours aint much, but if its a blast to play through, why dont do it again? Its certainly better than inflated 15 hour games with boring sections that have apparently no other use than to stretch the playtime, and most 10+ hour games have sections I hate - why even think about going back there...\n\nIm sure Motorstorm could have 2 dozend so-so tracks, 80 only visually different cars. But instead they aimed for quality levels, balancing them for all those different types of vehicles and made sure they play well.\n\nOf course it could have less tracks and suck, or could have more and all of them beeing excellent, its that general negativity of comparing numbers that pisses me off. Conversly you have that endlessly shallow and pointlessly random Oblivion getting hailed for being \"big\".[/rant]\n\nInteresting about the lasting appeal.\n\nThe demo, most people played the hell out of it, and guess what it only had 1 track. So, if you are enjoying 5 of the 8 tracks and playing online. I don't see why the lasting appeal is that big of a deal.\n\nThe second thing is options, while it's nice to have more \"options\" most times people play 2 or 3 gameplay styles which are their favorite.\n\nThe reasons for the lower scores in other categories is negligible for me. Though others may say spot on.\n\nSpeng.\n\nIt'll be interesting to see how the graphics/physics engine of Motorstorm compare to other racing/driving games.\n\nGame may not have enough tracks or modes but it seems the biggest accomplishment, and possibly the one that they spent the most time on, was to get this engine going using this \"difficult to develop for\" architecture.\n\nIn interviews, the development team members seem to indicate that they believe there's a lot of room for improvement/refinement.\n\nBut the game will need to sell well to finance big improvements in sequels? Or would they seek to leverage the engine with minor enhancements and new content (tracks) in sequels?\n\nIt's not a question of bias, but of competance.\n\nI know the VF fans like to bash DoA, but DoA has a faithful following and sells well (read: some people actually like it and buy it so it cannot be all bad in regards to consumer taste and appeal), and has evolved as a fighter. And what it may be lacking against a game like VF it has a big upside: Online play. How a reviewer weighs the game will depend on their sense of taste, style, skill, and how they play. The skill is a big one in that not everyone is an uber skilled/play non-stop fighting fan. They want to pick up and play, and even if they are very good they don't want to funnel hundreds of hours into the game. The difference is one of a totally absorbed fan versus someone who really likes the game. Sim junkies, for example, can rip a game apart and go for a \"lesser\" all around experience because certain aspects are so vitally important to them that aspects that appeal to the casuals and even more serious games who fall short of sim fanatics place more importance on other aspects.\n\nI think with VF/DoA we are seeing a schism: Exacting gameplay mechanics versus online play. Depending where you come from as a gamer one could absolutely trump the other. And I am sure reviewers have the same issues--which is more important to them?\n\nI am a big online gamer myself and while I understand why VF isn't online I have a hard time dismissing the lost gameplay/longevity gains lost by ignoring online play. Ideally a game would design an exacting fighting model that played well with online limitations.\n\nGameSpot has weighed in:\n\nThe Good: Core racing design is a riot; online multiplayer is a great deal of fun; superb visuals; great soundtrack and sound effects.\n\nThe Bad: A shallow package with only one (not very good) single-player mode; no offline multiplayer.\n\n...\n\nMotorstorm is a good game that also feels like it has a great deal of untapped potential. As an over-the-top, gorgeous-to-look-at racer, Motorstorm is absolutely a success. As a deep and lasting experience, it's far from it. The question, then, is what's more important to you? Is it of greater import to you that a game feature great racing mechanics and incredible graphics, features be damned? Or does a deep array of lasting modes and features make or break a game for you? If you answered yes to the former, then Motorstorm is unequivocally the game for you. If you answered yes to the latter, pay consideration to just how much you're going to get out of a solid online mode and a cheap-feeling single-player mode that you'll probably never go back to once you finish it. Either way, here's to hoping that the next time around, Evolution turns in a more fleshed-out experience to go with its great game design.\n\nAs much as I like longevity, a great racing/looking game with online play is worth a look. The 7.9 is a low score, but putting aside its flaws the good points do offer hours of high quality fun. A couple extra features, like split screen MP, seem to be the difference in the reviews. Always room for a sequal That no one is complaining about the core experience indicates that a sequal could easily resolve these issues. A great foundation for a new franchise.\n\nThe core experience/gameplay is indeed brilliant. I had the Japanese import and it was even more limited, but I had a tonne of fun with what was there. But when you're reviewing a game, things like game modes and options need to be accounted for.\n\nNot that I think \"7.9\" is low per se. Somewhere in the 8 range sounds right to me, and that's pretty much there.\n\nThere's a couple of other reviews out there now too (GameDaily - 8), GameRankings has a roundup of some others as usual too.\n\nwell 7.9 (and the 7.5 score by 1up) are low only by the expectations that people had for this game since E3 05. In reality (and by all accounts it does seem to be feature-short) it is a good score.\n\nFor example Lost Planet got knocked down a few pegs from my expected (based on screens and demos) 8.8 - 9.2 range due to a crappy SP methodology, but for me the MP alone makes LP a 9 in my book.\n\nso... to each his own and just enjoy MS on its own merits (the graphics and online play alone would do that for me as they do in Lost Planet)\n\nIts great that from the current reviews that i've read about the game, that no ones knockin it graphically for not being able to hit the E3 traget render, rather praising it for its amazing visuals :smile:\n\nAs to whether KZ will get the same treatment, thats something that remains to be seen\n\nI agree. I'm glad to see a beautiful game get the props it deserves without mad marketing punishing it. Sony brought the problem on themselves and so did anyone who believed either of the two famous pre-PS3 target renders."
