        "text": "\"Motorstorm Apocalypse\" lets you feel what it is like to race through a city experiencing an earthquake, tornado and urban warfare all at the same time. Apart from maybe driving down Atlantic Boulevard late on New Year's Eve, there is nothing else like it.\n\nWhat they're saying: From SCEA - \"Race in a ravaged city through 48 hours of pure mayhem ... Endure hundreds of explosive real-time dynamic events.\"\n\nWhat we're saying: Now if we weren't talking about a video game, that would sound like a pretty horrible time. But when you're experiencing mayhem from the comfort of your couch with a cold one in reach, it's actually pretty fun.\n\nThe nut graph: This is the third \"Motorstorm\" game for the PlayStation 3, and they have the formula down. You race in different classes, everything from dirt bikes and ATVs to monster trucks and big rigs. Often all the classes are in the same race, opening up different routes. And nobody is racing politely.\n\nThe races are chaotic, with large and small debris flying everywhere, and courses that change as buildings and bridges collapse. There are 40 races altogether, each taking a few minutes (sometimes you have to race one a few times to get a good enough finish to advance) and through three different difficulties. There is a weird little storyline that ties it together, but you can skip through it easily.\n\nAggression is rewarded more often than patience, but you'll need both. Fans of racing simulations like \"Gran Turismo 5\" might be put off by all the explosions, but the racing is mostly balanced.\n\nSince the PSN is finally alive again, you can try your hand online (or off-line with up to four-player split-screen) to extend your playtime. There is definitely some fun to be had there.\n\nIt's a solid game, definitely the best \"Motorstorm\" yet. You probably already know if this is your cup of tea, but if you don't mind a little (or a lot) of mayhem in your racing then give this a look.\n\nReason to smile: When you throw everything together for a perfect turn and pass, this game is as satisfying as they get.\n\nReason to growl: Sometimes the game forces you to look at some distant, oncoming catastrophe, just long enough for you to crash into a building.\n\nRobert McGinty: (904) 359-4250"
