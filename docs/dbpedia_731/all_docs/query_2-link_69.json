        "text": "News\n\nTech News\n\nGame review: Motorstorm Apocalypse\n\nThis story is from March 20, 2011\n\nGame review: Motorstorm Apocalypse\n\nMotorstorm Apocalypse is the third PS3 entry into Sonyâs off-road racing franchise.\n\nMotorstorm Apocalypse is the third PS3 entry into Sonyâs off-road racing franchise. The first two games taking place in natural terrain such as deserts and jungles. Keeping with the gameâs penchant for exotic locales, Apocalypse takes place in a city thatâs in the midst of an earthquake.\n\nWith the environments being a big draw for fans of the series, Apocalypse does not disappoint. Racing around a city when itâs at its crumbling worst is a visual treat with collapsing buildings and falling bridges making their presence felt during races. Thereâs always something in your way. So much so that it makes 2012 seem like a sock puppet show in comparison.\n\nSure, racing games usually focus on its cars, Apocalypseâs city is clearly the star of the show making tracks bend to its will, forcing you to seek alternative routes across the chaos. It gives you a great sense of satisfaction even if you donât place first.\n\nAnd it gets better. If natural disasters werenât enough youâd find mercenaries and survivors making their presence felt on the track as they try to sabotage races with gun fire, helicopters or Molotov cocktails.\n\nWhile the sheer magnitude of destruction on display rarely ceases to amaze some of the seriesâ quirks make a return in terms of gameplay. As was the case with its predecessors , the AI tends to be sadistic forcing some nasty moves that could be off-putting if this is your first game in the franchise. In addition to this vehicle handling is anything but smooth, rather it feels as if your ride is at times, cast in lead. Oh and you will crash. A lot.\n\nOld-timers would be right at home given that these elements were present since the seriesâ inception . Theyâre not deal-breakers but they add a fairly steep learning curve for a newcomer. Other changes include the ability to ram into an opponent apart from the usual boost, drifts and super jumps that have been mainstays of the series.\n\nThereâs a smorgasbord of vehicles to choose from too. Along with the usual buggies, big rigs, monster trucks, ATVs and dirt bikes there are choppers, superbikes and supercars in the fray. The sheer choice on display is fantastic.\n\nIn terms of graphics, Apocalypse is a mixed bag. It looks drop dead gorgeous in some places while in others it seems quite lacklustre with low textures and jagged edges making their presence felt. This is a bit of a letdown considering that this is a PS3 exclusive title.\n\nThe single-player mode consists of three careers to choose from as per level of difficulty and altogether wonât take you more than 6-7 hours to complete. While you will race around the same locations and tracks in each career, the drastically changing layout of the city will ensure that each career mode is significantly different from the next. And if youâre bored of playing alone thereâs a 2 player split-screen mode and online as well.\n\nApocalypseâs online mode is robust. Thereâs a levelling system with performance upgrades and unlocks such as skins and mods. Itâs as if theyâve ported Call of Dutyâs online mechanics for a racing game and itâs very well done. The clincher is the betting mode, allowing you to bet your in-game earnings known as chips giving you something more to play for.\n\nAll in all, Apocalypse is a great game for fans of the franchise. But if youâre willing to put up with its learning curve and quirks, itâs a fun title all the same.\n\nEnd of Article\n\nFOLLOW US ON SOCIAL MEDIA"
