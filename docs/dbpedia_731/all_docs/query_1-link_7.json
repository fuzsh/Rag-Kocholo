You'd have thought that's what they'd have been aiming for. :eek:\n\n0\n\nThis Might Sound Stupid But Weres Wreckreation In The Menu ?\n\nOk, I've just loaded this up.\n\nThe main menu when game starts offers\n\nFestival\n\nwreckreation\n\noptions\n\nsomething else\n\nselecting wreck (as said) offers \"split screen\" for which you either need to have your other controllers turned on or it will ask you to turn them on.\n\n0\n\nBut When U Load The Game And Go Onto Play It Shows U The Tickets Lets U Choose Ure Vehicle Then It Only Seems To Be 1 Player\n\nPaul, you might want to cut out the 'txt spk' - it asks in the posting tips that it's not used, and not to mention it looks daft as we're not limited in how many characters we can use on the forum like you would be in a text message.\n\n0\n\nPaul, you might want to cut out the 'txt spk' - it asks in the posting tips that it's not used, and not to mention it looks daft as we're not limited in how many characters we can use on the forum like you would be in a text message.\n\nI am not a fan of text speak myself but a tad petty if I may say so... :yawn:\n\n0"
