        "text": "It's hardly the first off-road racing game, but the choice of seven vehicle types going up against each other in the same race is what adds instant appeal to the races, with between eight and fifteen vehicles in any one race. The variety and the dynamic play created by having them all fight for the win is a big part of the fun; get on a bike for a light, speedy but demanding ride, crush everything and everyone in sight inside a big rig, or really get into the spirit of things in a buggy or rally car.\n\nIt's not the fastest racing experience you can find either, even among the first wave of PS3 games, but it's certainly the most enjoyable. Full-on environment, vehicle, driver and crash physics add an unprecedented feeling of depth to the gameplay; as you bounce around the wildly undulating terrain in a buggy, go flying off your bike into a rocky wall, or smash through anything in your way in a truck, this is pure fun as you fight to keep control of the race and master each track.\n\nIf you clip a small bit of tyre on the edge of an imposing rock, get ready for a rough landing after a brilliant crash - you'll never just bump off a wall and carry on. Hit some barrels left laying around in the vast, object-rich environment, and it will tear down the track for hundreds of metres - and the rag doll driver animation is superb to watch, especially in slow motion as you're thrown into a cliff before your own bike lands and crushes back on top of you.\n\nSo the crashes are just plain awesome, and although the respawn delay is relatively lenient, you're bound to lose a few places in the race. This is the core action you'll enjoy in MotorStorm, and it's often spellbinding stuff.\n\nIn terms of the singleplayer game, it's a lot of fun while it lasts, but once you've completed it there's little to tempt you back, especially with the fun you'll be having in the online mode.\n\nThere are 21 singleplayer 'tickets' to play through in total, and as you accumulate points and gold medals, you unlock more tickets and vehicles. Each ticket is made up of between one and four tracks. Tickets get progressively more challenging, and there's some nice event variety too - like the manic, unpredictable all-bike battle just for starters.\n\nPage: 1 2 3\n\nNEXT PAGE >>"
