        "text": "ShareRetired\n\nPrivate\n\n60%PlayStation 3\n\nA decent racing game. But way to difficult to unlock the last level. Unlocking the last level requires you to achieve first place in all the 20 levels before. An that is quite a challenge! Extremely frustrating to be speeding towards a win and then suddenly get knocked over by another truck and have to start the map from start again. On the other hand, quite rewarding to win a race you been struggling with.\n\nAll in all more frustration than i like in a racing game.\n\nShareCompleted\n\nStrypixx\n\n80%PlayStation 3\n\n12h Played\n\nOther than one particular, insane difficulty spike (looking at you, buggy byways), this is a really good arcade racer that seems to be forgotten by most unfortunately.\n\nShareCompleted\n\nsupah_mama_luigi\n\n80%PlayStation 3\n\nwould rate much higher if the multiplayer servers were still up. one of those games that feels like the main campaign is just training for the multiplayer, but since theres no multiplayer, all thats left is really frustrating AI races against CPUs that cheat. If theres a server revival in the next century, I'll be sure to revisit this one. EDIT- THOSE MFERS DID IT, PRIVATE SERVERS ARE HERE AND THE GAME HAS MULTIPLAYER! PLAY THIS SHIT BROS!\n\nShareCompleted\n\nRRC123\n\n90%PlayStation 3\n\nTo my surprise I liked the insane, over-the-top crashes and extreme racing of Motorstorm more than Burnout 3. While the physics can be unpredictable and spell ruin for you in higher-level races, it's still a really fun game which arcade racing fans should not overlook."
