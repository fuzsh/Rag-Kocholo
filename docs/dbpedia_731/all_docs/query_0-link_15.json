        "text": "Motor Storm: Pacific Rift is a Racing game available on the PS3. It can be played in Singleplayer Competitive Splitscreen modes.\n\nMotor Storm: Pacific Rift is a Racing game. Racing games, although sometimes seen as a sporting sub category, are a well established video game genre in their own right.\n\nMotor Storm: Pacific Rift can be played in a Singleplayer mode. Single Player Campaign games focus on one player's experience. Rather than collaborate with other players either locally or online, players progress alone. The campaign style of gameplay offers a connected series of challenges to play through. These chapters work together to tell a story through which players progress. Single player games are able to focus on one experience of a scenario, so that it is usually a richer, more visceral game.\n\nMotor Storm: Pacific Rift can be played in a Competitive mode. Competitive Multiplayer games provide experiences where players compete against each other and the computer. Obviously lending itself to sports and team games, these competitive engagements have also dominated the shooting and fighting genres because of the direct combat and expertise involved in each. Although these games were originally played in a split screen style, more recently they are played online via services such as PlayStation Network, Xbox Live and the Nintendo Wireless Connection."
