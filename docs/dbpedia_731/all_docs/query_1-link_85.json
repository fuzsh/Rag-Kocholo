The third MotorStorm game for PS3 has been in development for two years and its 3-D component for half that time. Developer Evolution Studios has done an admirable job implementing this technical gimmick, and in 3-D mode the demo maintains a steady 30fps framerate and the visual details hold up (at least better than in Killzone 3's first take in 3-D).\n\nMotorStorm: Apocalypse is understandably chaotic, however, and the 3-D distractions, like those flying crazies, make an already difficult race course more challenging to navigate. I slam into a few walls, not easily seeing turns in the impromptu \"track\" -- a straight-shot race through a crumbling, fictional West Coast city. I finish in something like 13th place and ask if I can see the game in \"2-D mode,\" but the demo doesn't allow for us to switch over.\n%Gallery-94881%",

During Apocalypse, all of the environmental destruction is predetermined -- it's scripted -- and not an apparent racing strategy (whereas Split/Second has players trigger the gameworld-changing events). Split/Second might offer the more engaging gameplay mechanic, but within the racing genre, large-scale environmental destruction is still relatively new; and Apocalypse can get away with its passive integration of exploding set pieces without being necessarily second-rate.\n\nThe apocalyptic theme fits in well with the general attitude of the series. To me, MotorStorm has always been about enjoying the hurt inflicted upon oneself and others more so than the thrill of winning a race. O'Brien says the development team hasn't tinkered much with the core gameplay, aside from a few updates, including the addition of some new vehicle classes (the demo featured a supercar). What has changed is a single-player Festival mode with deeper narrative elements. The Apocalypse story will alternate between three main characters as they ride out 48 hours of chaos."
