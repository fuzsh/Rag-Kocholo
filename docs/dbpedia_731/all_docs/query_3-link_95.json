        "text": "The Consensus: MotorStorm: Arctic Edge Review\n\nBy Anthony Gallegos |\n\nIntense racing, repetitive levels.\n\nGood\n\nPros:\n\nGreat-looking visuals; AI provides a pretty good challenge.\n\nCons:\n\nTracks start to feel repetitive during Festival Mode, making it feel like a bit of a grind.\n\nGameSpy's Take\n\nWhen I play a racing game, I don't care about how fast I'm going or what gear I'm in; the only thing that matters is whether or not I'm ahead of the pack. I'm not terribly fond of racing sims like Forza or Gran Turismo; though I recognize they're good games, I prefer arcade racers that challenge my reaction speed more than my ability to understand car mechanics. What I want out of a racing game is a fun selection of vehicles (real or fake), easy-to-learn controls that take skill to master, and a variety of tracks that make me want to keep coming back. MotorStorm: Arctic Edge nails the vehicles and the controls, but the levels really start to feel tired after a while (especially during the single-player \"Festival Mode\").\n\nArctic Edge gives me a sense of speed and almost-out-of-control tension, and the levels do a great job with verticality, allowing me to fly over my opponents in acrobatic moves straight out of \"Starsky & Hutch.\" The races are brutal, with ruthless drivers lashing out from their motorcycles, ATVs, big trucks, cars, and buggies. In the later levels of the game's single-player Festival Mode, I found myself dealing with highly aggressive AI that used weight advantages to slam me into walls and spin out other players in order to cause multi-car crashes. Having to choose a vehicle based on how much damage it can dish out -- as well as how fast it goes -- is something I can get behind anytime.\n\nArctic Edge may be a relatively intense racer, but its controls are deceptively simple to learn. The only buttons I really needed to think about were my accelerator, my brake, and my \"boost\" ability (which recharges over time, and can be abused to the point where the car breaks). But the simple interface is actually perfect for what Arctic Edge asks of the player, as the incredible speed and forward momentum of your vehicle -- combined with courses that feature an abundance of tight turns and abrupt walls -- creates an experience that demands attention and rewards skill. Sure, I might not be managing a bunch of gears as I go into an absurd turn, but it's nonetheless rewarding to pull off a line that shaves seconds off my time and bests the competition.\n\nDespite the great controls and awesomely aggressive nature of Arctic Edge's racing, I eventually found myself bored by the game's 12 tracks. Sure, they're not carbon copies of one another, but several share enough similarities that they not only fit together thematically, but ultimately just feel like one big track. The result: After a few hours of overall playtime, each race started to feel like a continuation of the previous event, turning the single-player game into a bit of a grind to get to the next rank (which unlocks new events). Online multiplayer breaks up the pace a bit, but the lack of friends to play with and the absence of any chat capability made it feel more like I was playing with really good AI instead of other people. Other ways to change up the experience like timed modes -- where you can race the ghosts of developers or try and best your own times -- also aid the single-player game, but they don't unlock any new cars, so I never found them too appealing.\n\nArctic Edge is a good portable racer, but I didn't find the tracks varied enough to keep my attention for more than a few minutes at a time. But hey, with an arcade-style racer like this, that's pretty much all you need -- and at least it's not costing you quarters each time.\n\nNext: Page 2 >>\n\nPage: 1 2"
