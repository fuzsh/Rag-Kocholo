        "text": "MotorStorm is a great game that is held back by it's lack of game types.\n\nUser Rating: 8.5 | MotorStorm PS3\n\nMotorStorm was one of the many Playstation 3 titles that started as a tech demo, this one was a tech demo shown at E3 2005. From that time, the game has evolved into one of the most intriguing racers of this new generation of consoles. Did Evolution Studios develop the game enough to make it a fun game instead of just a tech demo? Find out in my review of MotorStorm.\n\nThe first thing that I saw that led me away from thinking that this was just a tech demo was the gameplay. While this wasn't apparent until somewhere around Level 3, the AI is very smart and will do whatever it takes to win or at least beat you. This is not just the case though, as they also will square off against each other, making the game more realistic. The races end up becoming extremely hard but still maintain the fun factor. There are a couple of bad parts though, such as when you are racing as a big rig and flip over, most of the time the vehicle will not explode, and to be able to race again, you must run your boost up to full to blow the vehicle up.\n\nThe graphics in MotorStorm are incredible. This was clearly the part of the game that Sony was pointing out to be next gen. Everything looks nice, from the vehicles to the drivers and even to the mud on the ground. There is a nice bit of attention to detail as bikes and ATVs can punch and taunt one another and drivers of other vehicles will often stick their head out of their car to look behind them. When your vehicle explodes, the action goes into slow motion, and you can really see how good the graphics are.\n\nThe sound in MotorStorm is also great. All of the cars have different horns and different engine sounds, and this is all accompanied by in my opinion the greatest soundtrack ever to grace a video game. The incredible soundtrack consists of artists such as Every Time I Die, Nirvana, Primal Scream, Queens of the Stone Age, and Wolfmother. It even made me like songs that I didn't like before, such as Before I Forget by Slipknot.\n\nThis is where the game takes a hit. MotorStorm is bare bones. There is no split screen multiplayer, exhibition, time trial, or ghost mode, although a time trial and ghost mode should be coming in a patch soon. The single player isn't exactly a career mode, but it has enough to pass as the single player. Since it takes getting gold on all races to win, there's not really much to do after you beat the single player. The online multiplayer seems incredibly tacked on. Rooms are sloppy in the way that when you enter the room, you have to wait for a race to finish almost all the time. There is no available race filter and the speed of which you get into the race depends on if the host can make up his mind. While in the race, you can see everyone's name above their vehicle, which is nice, but it really doesn't cut it. A multiplayer mode this sloppy is most definitely not next gen.\n\nLooking back on the bright side, the design of MotorStorm is great. While there are only eight tracks, each one is beautifully designed with different routes that makes every race on it different. There are also a ton of different types of vehicles, including a bike, an ATV, a rally car, a buggy, a racing truck, a mud plugger, and a big rig. Each one has their pros and cons, and it makes for a very interesting and strategic race.\n\nMotorStorm is a great game that is held back by it's lack of game types. If it would have had those game types, especially split screen multiplayer, this would have been a much better game than it is. Even without the good game modes, this is another, or shall I say the other, impulse buy for the Playstation 3.\n\nOther Helpful Reviews for MotorStorm\n\nRating:7.2\n\nFun game, great graphics &amp; gameplay...but offline multiplayer should be standard...not a downloadable afterthought.\n\nShort and simple...this game is beautiful and the racing is addictively fun. It captures the essence of out of control off-road racing to a tee. The game looks absolutely amazing to be honest. But who came up with the br...
