        "text": "2009 has, in my opinion, been one of the best years ever to be a gamer.\n\nWith so many great games arriving and with plenty of 2008’s hits (Bioshock/Fallout 3/GTA IV/Metal Gear Solid 4 etc) falling in price it’s a great time to own a PS3.\n\nThrow the PSP resurgence into the mix and it adds up to one brilliant era for games.\n\nAnyway, now onto the main event! The awards you’ve been waiting for…\n\n.\n\nBEST DLC (Downloadable Content)\n\nWINNER: Fallout 3 – Expansion Packs\n\nOffering hours and hours more gameplay and an extended level cap to boot, the various DLC packs for Fallout 3 were well above anything else that arrived this year. Getting back into the Capital Wasteland never felt so good. 🙂\n\nRUNNERS UP:\n\nKillzone 2 – Maps\n\nLittleBigPlanet – Various Costumes\n\nBatman – Play as Joker Challenge Maps\n\n.\n\nBEST GAME INNOVATION\n\nWINNER: Killzone 2 (Changing Game Modes Within A Consistent Online Match)\n\nKillzone brought the noise in more ways than one but the changing game types within one online game was pretty sweet. Meaning that just as you’d be capturing the flag (speaker) the game could switch to deathmatch (Body Count) or whatever which in turn means that no two rounds are ever the same – genius.\n\nRUNNERS UP:\n\nInFamous (Karma System Working Within Empire City)\n\nPrototype (Running Up Buildings)\n\nCall Of Duty: Modern Warfare 2 (Deathstreaks)\n\n.\n\nBEST TRAILER\n\nWINNER: Assassin’s Creed II\n\nThere were lots of amazing trailers in 2009 but for me the most impressive both visually and with respect to what the gameplay promised, was Assassin’s Creed II. A fantastic game that saw you playing through the 1400’s in Italy, the trailer showed off exactly what the game had to offer.\n\nRUNNERS UP:\n\nUncharted 2\n\nBattlefield: Bad Company 2\n\nGod Of War 3\n\n.\n\nMOST ANTICIPATED GAME OF 2010:\n\nWINNER: Battlefield: Bad Company 2\n\nHeavy Rain was nailed on for this and while it’s still one of my most anticipated games of next year, playing through the beta of Battlefield: Bad Company 2 has swayed me in favour of DICE’s first person shooter. With vehicles as well as guns this one looks set to rock it come March 2010.\n\n.\n\nBEST SOUNDTRACK (SCORE)\n\nWINNER: Killzone 2 (Joris De Man)\n\nThere have been plenty of great scores in the games of 2009 but Killzone 2’s is awesome. ‘Helgan Forever’, the main theme, will live long in the memory – mainly due to the fact that it is a fantastic, stirring, piece of music. Brilliant throughout the game, Joris De Man’s score is a great companion to a stunning game.\n\nRUNNERS UP:\n\nUncharted 2\n\nInfamous\n\nPrototype\n\n.\n\nBEST SOUNDTRACK (LICENSED)\n\nWINNER: Dirt 2\n\nWith a soundtrack featuring the might of Elbow, Yeah Yeah Yeahs, The Subways, Black Tide, Ladyhawke and Queens Of The Stone Age, Dirt 2 takes pole position in the soundtrack stakes. With a nice variety of styles it says a lot when you don’t get bored of the tracks after hearing them a few times and the inventive use of music through the menus and loading screens was a great touch.\n\nRUNNERS UP:\n\nMotorstorm: Arctic Edge (PSP)\n\nWet\n\nBrutal Legend\n\n.\n\nBEST VOICE ACTING\n\nWINNER: Uncharted 2\n\nWell, what can you say about the voice acting of Uncharted 2. It has to be one of the very best performances ever given in a game. I listened to an interview in which the cast compared the experience to theatre as they were all in the same room together for all of the voicing/motion capture and boy does it show. The chemistry between all the actors involved is apparent throughout and some of the ad libbed stuff is stunning.\n\nRUNNERS UP:\n\nGhostbusters: The Video Game\n\nWet\n\nBatman: Arkham Ayslum\n\n.\n\nBEST GRAPHICS\n\nWINNER: Uncharted 2\n\nKillzone 2 ran Uncharted 2 very, very close for this award but in the end Naughty Dog takes it on the variety of stunning locations they manage to fit into the game – especially the areas with some of the most realistic snow I’ve ever seen. The character models are superb and the animation is extremely well done.\n\nRUNNERS UP:\n\nKillzone 2\n\nDirt 2\n\nBatman: Arkham Asylum\n\n.\n\nBEST SPORTS GAME\n\nWINNER: FIFA 10\n\nIf you’d told me 18 months ago FIFA would be winning an award on my blog I would’ve thought you were insane. In tandom with the decline of PES, FIFA has risen to former glories and is now the definitive football (soccer) game. This game actually makes you think about the build up play well in advance and, even more importantly, lets you have full control over the action on the pitch.\n\nRUNNERS UP:\n\nFight Night Round 4\n\nDirt 2\n\nMadden 10\n\n.\n\nBEST PSP GAME\n\nWINNER: GTA Chinatown Wars\n\nThere have been some great titles for the PSP this year but GTA Chinatown Wars pips them all at the post for sheer volume. There is so much to do in Liberty City and while the missions are bite sized there are plenty of them to get stuck into. A cast of colourful characters (as usual) helps matters and this is a fitting entry into the GTA universe.\n\nRUNNERS UP:\n\nAssassin’s Creed Bloodlines\n\nResistance: Retribution\n\nLittleBigPlanet\n\n.\n\nBEST STORYLINE\n\nWINNER: InFamous\n\nInfamous was a surprise hit for me as I was looking forward to Prototype a lot more. However Cole McGrath’s story of dealing with superpowers and finding out how the explosion happened was so great I played the game twice. With a few twists I didn’t see coming this game boasts a really great story. Uncharted 2 ran this close as it had a brilliant story but Infamous just pips it at the post.\n\nRUNNERS UP:\n\nWet\n\nAssassin’s Creed II\n\nUncharted 2\n\n.\n\nSINGLE PLAYER GAME OF THE YEAR\n\nWINNER: Uncharted 2\n\nUndoubtedly the best single player game for some time, Uncharted 2 makes you feel like the star of the best action movie ever. This is one of those games where all the pieces come together so well it’s a completely seamless experience. Brilliant.\n\nRUNNERS UP:\n\nInfamous\n\nBatman: Arkham Asylum\n\nAssassin’s Creed II\n\n.\n\nMULTIPLAYER GAME OF THE YEAR\n\nWINNER: Killzone 2\n\nIs there a more satisfying sound that the ping of a kill on Killzone 2? 🙂 Giving the players more weight made the game feel heavier but seemingly fairer than a ‘twitch’ shooter like Modern Warfare 2. Killzone 2 is certainly the game I spent most time online with this year – clocking up in excess of 100 hours, which is a first for me. Great online fun.\n\nRUNNERS UP:\n\nDirt 2\n\nCall Of Duty: Modern Warfare 2\n\nUncharted 2\n\n.\n\nGAME OF THE YEAR\n\nWINNER: Uncharted 2\n\nNaughty Dog’s excellent Uncharted 2 is no surprise as game of the year. Having already seen it take the gong at Spike’s VGA Awards I am following suit and giving Uncharted 2 the Game Of The Year Award for 2009. A fantastic, deep gaming experience with a great multiplayer added to boot. Seriously I’d like to speak to someone who played this and didn’t like it. As a whole Uncharted 2 is the best game in years and a very worthy winner.\n\nRUNNERS UP:\n\nInFamous\n\nAssassin’s Creed II\n\nKillzone 2\n\n.\n\nWow, still struggling to believe we’re nearly done with 2009!\n\nIt says a lot about this year that a title as great as Batman: Arkham Asylum can be nominated for 4 awards and not win one. Quality titles abound.\n\nIt’s been an amazing year for gaming and the quality looks set to continue into 2010 with a host of great releases.\n\nLet me know what your highlights were for 2009!\n\n.\n\nDecember 17, 2009\n\nCategories: Gaming, GregHorrorShow Awards 2009 .

Author: greghorrorshow . Comments: 7 Comments\n\nAfter the recent release of a few driving games on the PSP I thought it might be worth taking a look at them across various sections so that people looking to buy can make a more informed choice.\n\nFor full reviews of each see the links below:\n\nMOTORSTORM: ARCTIC EDGE\n\nGRAN TURISMO\n\nDIRT 2\n\nSo here we go…\n\nGRAPHICS\n\nObviously a big part of any gaming experience but boy do people love cars that look good 🙂\n\nDirt 2 is the least prettiest of the three with Motorstorm’s slightly cartoonish style in second place. Gran Turismo takes the chequered flag in this department, with some lush visuals although the odd screen tear stops it getting a perfect 10.\n\nMotorstorm 8\n\nGran Turismo 9\n\nDirt 2 6\n\nDirt 2: “The least prettiest of the three…”\n\nHANDLING\n\nHow your car handles is obviously an important part of any driving game and these titles are no different.\n\nMotorstorm’s use of boost is well implemented and you only ever feel out of control via your own mistakes.\n\nGran Turismo’s handling is lifelike and if you try to drive like a maniac you will up in the wall before long.\n\nDirt 2 isn’t too bad in this respect but at times it’s difficult to tell whether the game is keeping tabs on things like grip etc as it’s often possible to just hold down accelerate and take turns.\n\nMotorstorm 8\n\nGran Turismo 9\n\nDirt 2 7\n\nGAME MODES\n\nNo doubt about the winner here – Motorstorm has a fabulous single player campaign of ranking up and tackling different events in different vehicles.\n\nGran Turismo doesn’t have much in the way of modes for single player, it’s just race where you want to and while Dirt 2 does have a World Tour mode it’s pretty limited and doesn’t have much to keep you coming back.\n\nMotorstorm 9\n\nGran Turismo 7\n\nDirt 2 7\n\nMotorstorm: “Has a fabulous single player campaign.”\n\nMUSIC\n\nAgain Motorstorm takes this hands down – some great tracks on there including the anthem ‘Omen’ by The Prodigy. Good use of music.\n\nWell the other two games are much of a muchness – not a great deal of music, surely they could’ve squeezed some more tunes in there?\n\nMotorstorm 9\n\nGran Turismo 7\n\nDirt 2 8\n\nCAR SOUNDS\n\nGran Turismo wins out in the engine stakes – you really can hear the difference in vehicles, even when the cars are similar.\n\nMore impressive than Motorstorm because Motorstorm’s engine sounds only vary between different types of vehicles. (i.e cars and trucks)\n\nAnd sadly Dirt 2’s engines sound the same regardless of what you’re driving.\n\nMotorstorm 8\n\nGran Turismo 9\n\nDirt 2 6\n\nGran Turismo:”You really can hear the difference in vehicles.”\n\nTRACK SELECTION\n\nMoving onto the available tracks and Gran Turismo roars into the lead – yes you race each course backwards and forwards but even so there are still a huge amount of tracks to race on.\n\nMotorstorm also has quite a selection and also gets a bonus for mutliple routes through each track.\n\nDirt 2 lags behind again – boasting in the region of around 8 tracks. 😦\n\nMotorstorm 8\n\nGran Turismo 9\n\nDirt 2 6\n\nVEHICLE SELECTION\n\nYou can’t argue with 800 cars. Gran Turismo is the undisputed king in this round, regardless of the fact some are just different models of the same car.\n\nOne of the main points of Motorstorm is to race different types of vehicles against each other so it wouldn’t be much of a game without a decent selection of vehicles. New snow based vehicles have been added to the usual Motorstorm suspects.\n\nDirt 2 doesn’t deliver massively on the vehicle front but there is probably just about enough to keep you going.\n\nMotorstorm 8\n\nGran Turismo 9\n\nDirt 2 7\n\nGran Turismo: trumps Motorstorm right at the end.\n\nOVERALL\n\nMotorstorm 58 / 70\n\nGran Turismo 59 / 70\n\nDirt 2 47 / 70\n\nIt’s a very close race between the front two but Dirt 2 is way back in last place.\n\nGran Turismo trumps Motorstorm right at the end based on Vehicle and Track selection.\n\nMy advice would be simply – if you can’t afford both then go with Motorstorm for mindless fun or Gran Turismo for a slightly harder but more rewarding driving experience.\n\nOctober 29, 2009\n\nCategories: Gaming .

Author: greghorrorshow . Comments: 2 Comments\n\nI really enjoyed the two Motorstorm titles on PS3 (despite online connection issues with Pacific Rift :mad:) and so I was really looking forward to getting some boost action on the small screen.\n\nThe game throws you straight into racing and the set up is the same as the PS3 versions. Race different types of events to unlock more vehicles and rank up. The more you rank up the more advanced races you have access to.\n\nThe music is great, with a particular nod here to the Prodigy ‘Omen’… in one race as a bike I came hurtling along a high route, off a ramp and just as the Prodigy track kicked in I overtook two trucks below me while I was in the air before landing well and keeping them in my rearview mirror. 😎\n\nThe game appeared a little easy at first and I was worried I might have another Dirt on my hands but after 10 or 15 races it started becoming more challenging.\n\nPart of the challenge is working out which of the vehicles to go for: a bike for speed but lack of control on ice? Or a big rig – slow as hell but controllable? With the vehicles on offer it’s certainly a dilemma! 😀\n\nThe multiple routes through each race are fantastic, often seeing you grab victory from the jaws of defeat and the inclusion of ice bridges is a neat touch.\n\nIce bridges are for routes high up and cannot take the weight of heavier vehicles. But obviously if you’re in a big vehicle you can take the route and break the bridge to stop other using it – is it worth the cost of a crash?\n\nAnother thing that raises the bar compared to other PSP driving games I’ve played is that you will often find yourself smashed by the other vehicles – resulting in a) some amazing slow motion crashes and b) a real determination to get back up the field as soon as possible.\n\nYou can go from near enough last to first in one lap on Motorstorm, which often means you never feel like you’re completely out of the running. It’s quite an achievement for any game to make you feel excited when you’re 8th with half a lap left and you’re still pushing for the win 😆\n\nWith options to (cosmetically) customise your vehicles and of course play friends online, Motorstorm PSP is an essential purchase for anyone with a PSP.\n\nRating: 9/10\n\nOctober 22, 2009\n\nCategories: Gaming .
