        "text": "I played the beta - while it was nice from a technical viewpoint, performance was very good, the experience for me was a resounding \"meh\". But it's not really my genre, perhaps others would enjoy it more.\n\nHowever. As much as people dislike loot boxes (for good reason), are we now in a position where \"some of the mechanics of the game could be used to milk consumers\" is a negative, when it doesn't exist as of yet? I don't think any review should include the phrase \"the game may not be great at the moment, but it has the potential to!\". Similarly, I don't think judging a game by potential future consumer fleecing is acceptable either. If loot boxes are introduced, sure, go to town. But as it is today, if they don't exist, why concern yourself with it?\n\nAs a matter of fact, couldn't \"feeling that this game was originally designed to sell loot boxes\" be also interpreted as that they were going to be a part of the game, but were removed from the end product? Shouldn't this be a pro then instead of a con?\n\nThis game sums up the issue with modern games perfectly. Not just that it has lootboxes, or that it seems to have been rushed to completion with many noticeable issues that are inexcusable from a modern, experienced game company.\n\nThat issue is updates. Sure, this game might be OK now, but the fact that an entire lootbox system could be introduced a month from now, once all the reviews are out, is disturbing.\n\nin the PS3 era, this didnt happen, largely thanks to limitations on download sizes and the insane costs of pushing patches to consoles implemented by both sony and MS at the time. Before that, games had to be finished before release, or you would lose more then just faith from consumers, you would lose tons of money. Today, entire mechanics and monetization schemes can be installed in a matter of minutes (or hours, given the insane sizes of game patches and the lack of proper internet infrastructure in much of the US) to year old games because the developer feels like it.\n\nThis generation has been really good at making me miss previous generations in a way the ps2 and ps3 never did. I think I'm going to go play some motorstorm now, without lootboxes, to try and forget about this.....\n\nI loved Motorstorm so much that I was willing to buy this game just to help keep the studio alive, and maybe produce a real successor in the future.\n\nYou won't get one.\n\nArcade racers are dead, editors don't want them because reasons.\n\nThis game only managed to exists because.. well there's no \"racing\", no single player content, competitive only, designed as Saas and filled with microtransactions.\n\nThe only way to make a game with cars in it was to cater to every stupid current economical trope so an editor would agree to put the cash for it.\n\nAnd of course, as a 60$/€ game, it is dead on arrival.\n\nAnd bean-counters will say \"See, an arcade racer flopped, we told you..\" because of course, that was the reason.\n\nI loved Motorstorm so much that I was willing to buy this game just to help keep the studio alive, and maybe produce a real successor in the future.\n\nYou won't get one.\n\nArcade racers are dead, editors don't want them because reasons.\n\nThis game only managed to exists because.. well there's no \"racing\", no single player content, competitive only, designed as Saas and filled with microtransactions.\n\nThe only way to make a game with cars in it was to cater to every stupid current economical trope so an editor would agree to put the cash for it.\n\nAnd of course, as a 60$/€ game, it is dead on arrival.\n\nAnd bean-counters will say \"See, an arcade racer flopped, we told you..\" because of course, that was the reason.\n\nBy the same token, there's been a push to redefine what constitutes \"arcade\" racing. Most people these days would say that the success of Forza Horizon shows that arcade racing is still viable, but that's like saying the success of Call of Duty means arena shooters are still alive and well.\n\nI loved Motorstorm so much that I was willing to buy this game just to help keep the studio alive, and maybe produce a real successor in the future. I was willing to do that all the way until you brought up loot boxes. I hate loot boxes so viscerally that even the mere possibility that this game was designed for them, and that they might be introduced in the future, is such a turn-off for me, that I can't give this team any of my money.\n\nNo matter how amazingly good Motorstorm was.\n\nLoot boxes in racing games is not a new thing. GRAN TURISMO had them even, in certain races they awarded cars (the real money makers) at \"random\" when you placed first. Admittedly the list of possible cars was at worst, 5.\n\nThe push to get you to but crates however has me thinking really hard about never touching the game.\n\nI loved Motorstorm so much that I was willing to buy this game just to help keep the studio alive, and maybe produce a real successor in the future.\n\nYou won't get one.\n\nArcade racers are dead, editors don't want them because reasons.\n\nThis game only managed to exists because.. well there's no \"racing\", no single player content, competitive only, designed as Saas and filled with microtransactions.\n\nThe only way to make a game with cars in it was to cater to every stupid current economical trope so an editor would agree to put the cash for it.\n\nAnd of course, as a 60$/€ game, it is dead on arrival.\n\nAnd bean-counters will say \"See, an arcade racer flopped, we told you..\" because of course, that was the reason.\n\nHow to make a successful arcade racer 101.\n\n1.Put Mario as the first word in the games title.\n\n2.proffit\n\nAs a matter of fact, couldn't \"feeling that this game was originally designed to sell loot boxes\" be also interpreted as that they were going to be a part of the game, but were removed from the end product? Shouldn't this be a pro then instead of a con?\n\nI haven't played Onrush, so I can't comment on that specific game, but having played Bust-a-Move Journey and Arkanoid vs. Space Invaders on mobile, I can say that games with lootbox-style mechanics but no actual lootboxes to buy can suck just as much, and sometimes more.\n\nConsider the following three fictional game unlockable systems:\n\n1. No lootboxes. All of the game's unlockables are unlocked after 10 hours of gameplay.\n\n2. All of the game's unlockables are unlocked after 1,000 hours of gameplay. But you can buy lootboxes to speed up the process.\n\n3. All of the game's unlockables are unlocked after 1,000 hours of gameplay. But there are no lootboxes.\n\nUnlockable system number 2 is arguably better than unlockable system number 3, because while both 2 and 3 are fully accessible by patient players without other games to play, at least number 2 gives impatient players another option to unlock things, if they really want to and care less about money than the time they would otherwise have to spend on the game in order to get what they want.\n\nUnderstand that this is not an endorsement of lootboxes, which still suck. Unlockable system number 1 is hands-down the best one presented here, because it is neither predatory nor unreasonable. Good game design demands reasonable balance, not just the absence of lootboxes. Games that punished players with excessive grinding existed long before the ability to implement microtransactions did.\n\nIf loot boxes are introduced, sure, go to town. But as it is today, if they don't exist, why concern yourself with it?\n\nAs a matter of fact, couldn't \"feeling that this game was originally designed to sell loot boxes\" be also interpreted as that they were going to be a part of the game, but were removed from the end product? Shouldn't this be a pro then instead of a con?\n\nThere are loot boxes in the game, they're just not buyable with Real World Money (RWM). This is normally a benign type of loot box, that has been used for decades. Except - if you go into the game design intending these to be for RWM it poisons the well, leading you to design in user hostile ways.\n\nNobody would have thought SW:BF2's original progression was a good idea except they were trying to sell you loot boxes to speed up that horrible process. Nobody would have thought Diablo III's Auction House, which replaces the beautiful addictive core loop of having better items drop for you (and getting attached to them) with a boring business transaction for all your gear, was a good idea if they weren't trying to skim real money off you. Shadow of Mordor, 'nuff sed.\n\nDesigning a game for real world loot money boxes, unless they're purely cosmetic and you don't cripple the normal progression for them, fundamentally leads to a compromised game. Like maybe in this case having a bunch of crappy multiplayer modes and not enough single player modes."
