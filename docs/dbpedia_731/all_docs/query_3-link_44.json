        "text": "ShareCompleted\n\njasonfynne\n\n50%PlayStation 4\n\n10h Played\n\nTL;DR You can't even buy this anymore so this is just for myself then, obviously.\n\nSo. This one is now delisted, you can't rate it on the PSN, and when you boot it up it can't start in Online mode anymore (which tells me the servers are shut down) - for a game only four-years-old, this must have crashed-and-burned REALLY well. But we're in a time where any free-to-play game could be turned off at any moment if it isn't making any money.\n\nThere is certainly a \"money-making\" cosmetic backside to \"Onrush\" that I wasn't around to experience: when I bought it, they were giving the standard edition away at three-bucks. At that price I'm willing to try anything, especially a Codemaster's arcade-racing game. They've been around since the micro-computer days I'm nostalgic for, and even better for the game now if it isn't shoving coin packs in my face when I boot it up. HOWEVER, making you unable to level up unless you're connected? Callous, Codemasters. That's a whole handful of PSN trophies that no one will be able to unlock anymore.\n\nBesides that, what a surprise it was to find such a lengthy single-player campaign hidden within Onrush's hollowed-out offline shell. No, you can't buy it on Playstation anymore and I'm probably only writing this for my own benefit (or to anyone who still has it backlogged). But what started out as a poor-man's \"Flatout\" actually became really addictive. It didn't happen right away: I was ready to write it off from the beginning. Every car seems underpowered no matter how brutish they look and it's a real struggle to keep up with the pack: I kept getting stuck in the rear where you aren't far enough back for the game to respawn you automatically but you aren't close enough to any other drivers to make a difference in the events. This sucked particularly hard in the Overdrive mode that dominates the race-types: you have to keep accelerating to get points, and in the campaign's later missions the margin for error is so tiny that braking to get the game to catch you back up could mean losing a round. And don't get me started on those motorbikes: they're terrible. Why? They just are. I hated driving them, they felt bad, and any time a bikes-only event came up I cringed. Thank goodness you aren't technically required to beat every race to progress: just fulfill a set of challenges.\n\nI didn't play it for a while after that, but I went back to it during my dark days (when I didn't have any other racing games and I was waiting for NFS Heat to go on sale) and found there were actually addictive qualities to the gameplay I only noticed by sticking with it. I learned the track layouts (not a huge track list, but what's there are huge & varied with lots of shortcuts) and the vehicle type that was right for me (the Enforcer, because it's excellent) and from there I settled into a comfortable gameplay loop with a range of event types (I still hate Switch, though) and AI opponents that subtly increased in difficulty before I even realized it. The feeling of crushing an opponent under the weight of my car after multiple takedowns, accompanied by Criterion-levels of destruction, was a satisfying reward for my education.\n\nIf this is truly the end-of-the-road for Onrush, may it RIP well. I enjoyed it for what it was after some fierce growing pains, and maybe I would have liked it more if it didn't go out of its way to be so irritating so often.\n\nShareCompleted\n\nwhlrtkrd\n\n70%PlayStation 4\n\n22h 58m Played\n\nAppropriate title, it's such a rush I didn't understand what was going on for the first few hours. Once I started to pick the most appropriate vehicle class for each event type (usually the bigger stronger ones) I became much more successful.\n\nIt's a shame the game sold so badly because the developers getting fired stopped them from being able to fix some problems which could have quite easily made it a better game. Post-match summaries take a whole minute of dubstep and can't be skipped. That would have been easy to fix. Don't panic and close down a studio after one game. But since EA bought Codemasters they would have shut it down by now anyway.\n\nMostly the issues are with visibilty. Activating the special rush mode usually just sends you into the wall at high speed rather than into the opposition. Night-time, snow, or night-time AND snow levels are just as bad as Driveclub from the same developers. See you soon at yet another publisher.\n\nEven with the issues I think it was well worth trying. Even in single player, even with all this AAA rubbish: hats, multiple currencies, microtransactions, lootboxes...\n\nShareCompleted\n\nBlue_Odeyssey\n\n60%PlayStation 4\n\n11h Progress\n\nGame burns out long before the end of the career. While the team dynamic is a good idea, it often feels disempowering - you can have the race of your life, but if your AI doesn't pull its weight, then there's not much you can do. It's fine in single events as you can restart and try again, but later in the campaign, knockout tournaments are introduced. This often feels like it's reduce to pot luck whether you finish.\n\nThe takedown system is a sub-par version of Burnout's with many clashes feeling unfair and creating strange outcomes (a tap from a bike can take down a truck etc.). Also, the game gives the player no leeway after taking an opponent down, but clutters the screen making it difficult to avoid crashing - defeating the object of driving aggressively.\n\nIt has some nice ideas, with the game requiring players to boost to score being the most fun showing the most promise, but clearly was built on a budget as car handling is mediocre.\n\nFun is small doses with the sound turned down and something else in the background.\n\n5.8/10"
