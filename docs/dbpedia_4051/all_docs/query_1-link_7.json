        "text": "Impressions en Plein Air\n\n(From Flight 2199, regarding Monet)\n\nby Andrena Zawinski\n\nFar above the street scene graffiti of Paris,\n\nI think of you, Monet, from the air up here\n\nflying this sea foam sky, a shelf of waves\n\nagainst a floor of mist breaking open\n\nin patches of blue and white.\n\nAnd I, like some devotee of impending\n\ncollisions in texture and transparency, dapple\n\nwords as Giverny expatriates might have once\n\non palettes a harvest of light, cultivating\n\na poetry of space en plein air.\n\nI have looked, Monet, into the mirror into which\n\nyou must have many times glanced or long gazed,\n\nyour Orient prints awash in blue flirting the glass\n\nwith the constant movement of the sea\n\nin which little else has changed.\n\nYou grew big bellied with age, tousle of hair thick\n\nwith gray, sight on the wane, canvases growing,\n\nyou padding through the long yawn of rooms\n\npainted blue as lichen, yellow as sunflowers,\n\nreflecting lilies afloat between the sky and the water.\n\nBut in your garden, beyond the rose blanketed fence,\n\nthose flowers brown now in a wilted July. I have looked,\n\nMonet, into the mirror into which you must have\n\nglanced or long gazed recollecting those lilies for me,\n\nyet another tourist here.\n\nThey tell me the best part of your life was inhabiting\n\nthese gardens. And as the light fades, I cannot help\n\nbut wonder where it is next that I will go, and of my words,\n\nwhat will they become stretching there\n\nen plein air.\n\nFirst appeared at Adirondack Review and in the author’s collection, Something About.\n\nPHOTO: Water garden at Claude Monet’s home and garden in Giverny, France, by Gilles Bizet.\n\nPAINTING: Claude Monet, Water Lilies and Japanese Bridge, 1899, Princeton University Art Museum, New Jersey.\n\nNOTE: Giverny is located on the right bank”of the river Seine at its confluence with the river Epte. Situated 50 miles west-northwest of Paris, in the province of Normandy, the village is best known as the location of Claude Monet‘s garden and home. In 1883, Monet and his family rented a house and gardens in Giverny. In 1890, he had enough money to buy the house and land outright and set out to create the magnificent gardens he wanted to paint. Monet lived and painted in Giverny from 1883 to his death, at age 86, in 1926.\n\nNOTE FROM THE AUTHOR: Giverny, a lovely train ride from Paris, is a favorite destination for many to see Monet’s home and gardens as it was for me. To walk where he walked during the most satisfying part of his life was to witness not only his Impressionism on canvas, but to imagine his everyday life “en plein air.” This poem was written on the plane ride home leaving Paris, incorporating qualities of the painting style through color and texture of words.\n\nPHOTO: Claude Monet with some of his water lily paintings. Source: History in Color by Dana Keller.\n\nABOUT THE AUTHOR: Andrena Zawinski’s poetry has received numerous awards for lyricism, form, spirituality, and social concern, several of them Pushcart Prize nominations. Her latest book is Landings from Kelsay Books; others are Something About from Blue Light Press (a PEN Oakland Award) and Traveling in Reflected Light from Pig Iron Press (a Kenneth Patchen Prize), along with several chapbooks. Her poetry has previously appeared on Poetry and Places.\n\nGjirokastër Stroll\n\nby Norma Wightman\n\nWorkmen hammer the limestone chunks,\n\nfitting them tightly into a new walkway.\n\nWheelbarrows of stone and sand stand\n\nhelter-skelter among workmen as they\n\nbend to their labors. They scarcely take\n\nnotice as tourists weave around the\n\nconstruction to reach shops beckoning\n\nwith carpets, crochet work, and carvings.\n\nI watch the men sculpting the stones\n\nto fit snugly against each other; admire\n\ntheir deft handling of the weighty rocks.\n\nI ask our guide how much these men might\n\nearn each month—the answer comes first in\n\nLekes, then Euros. The amount would barely\n\npay for the smallest carving a nearby tourist\n\njust decided to buy.\n\nPHOTO: Gjirokastër, Albania. Photo by Ervin Gjata.\n\nNOTE: Gjirokastër is a city and in southern Albania, in a valley between the Gjerë mountains and the Drino River. Its old town is a UNESCO World Heritage Site, described as “a rare example of a well-preserved Ottoman town, built by farmers of large estate.”\n\nNOTE FROM THE AUTHOR: When I toured Albania in 2019, Gjirokastër struck me as the most picturesque of Ottoman-era cities carved from stone. Stone masonry is a major craft in the city, but the pay is poor and many masons travel to Greece to ply their skill for better pay.\n\nPHOTO: Tourist shops and stone streets in Gjirokastër, Albania. Photo by Ervin Gjata.\n\nABOUT THE AUTHOR: Norma Wightman is a retired teacher who has lived on the California Central Coast for 30 years. She travels widely with her husband, but when at home leads interpretive walks for California State Parks. No surprise that her favorite poetry themes are related to nature. Her poems have been published in Echoes Poetry Journal, Your Daily Poem (online), and in chat books.\n\nThe German Hotel\n\nby Charles Bukowski\n\nthe German hotel was very strange and expensive and had\n\ndouble doors to the rooms, very thick doors, and it over—\n\nlooked the park and the vasser tern and in the mornings\n\nit was usually too late for breakfast and the maids\n\nwould be everywhere changing sheets and bringing in\n\ntowels, but you never saw any hotel guests, only the\n\nmaids and the desk man and the day desk man was all\n\nright because we were sober during the day but we had\n\ntrouble with the night man who was some sort of snob\n\nand not very good with getting the corkscrews and ice\n\nand wine glasses up to us and he was always phoning to\n\nsay the other guests objected to our noise.\n\nwhat other guests?\n\nI always told him that everything was very quiet,\n\nnothing was going on, that somebody must be crazy, so\n\nwill you please stop ringing?\n\nbut he kept ringing, he became almost like a\n\ncompanion to us through the night.\n\nbut the day man was very nice, he always had little\n\nmessages of importance that either meant money, or a\n\ngood friend coming to see us, or both.\n\nwe stayed at the hotel twice during our trip to\n\nEurope and each time we checked out the day clerk\n\nbowed ever so slightly, he was tall and well-dressed\n\nand pleasant and he said each time: “it was nice to\n\nhave you with us. please come here again if you return.”\n\n“thank you,” we said, “thank you.”\n\nit’s our favorite hotel and if I ever get rich I am\n\ngoing to buy it and fire the night clerk and there will\n\nbe enough ice cubes and corkscrews for everybody.\n\nNOTE: Charles Bukowski wrote “The German Hotel” in 1979, the year following his first trip to his birthplace, Andernach, Germany. The poem appeared in Wormwood Review, No. 81, 1981.\n\nPHOTO: Andernach, Germany. Photo by Yakari-Travel.\n\nNOTE: Andernach is a town with a current population of about 30,000 in Rhineland-Palatinate, Germany. Located on the banks of the Rhine River, it is one of the oldest towns in Germany, tracing its origins to a Roman settlement in 12 B.C.\n\nPHOTO: Birthplace of Charles Bukowski, Aktienstraße 12, 56626 Andernach, Germany. Photo by Smalltown Boy.\n\nABOUT THE AUTHOR: Quintessential Los Angeles poet and novelist Charles Bukowski was born on August 16, 1920 in Andernach, Germany, where his parents met a few years before. Bukowski’s German-American father Henry was a sergeant in the United States Army serving in Germany after the country’s 1918 defeat during WWI. Henry had an affair with Katharina Fett, a German friend’s sister, and she became pregnant. Charles Bukowski claimed to have been born out of wedlock, but Andernach marital records show that his parents married one month before his birth. On April 23, 1923, the family sailed from Bremerhaven, Germany, to Baltimore, Maryland, where they settled. In 1930 the family moved to Los Angeles, where Bukowski lived most of his life. He died of leukemia in the Los Angeles community of San Pedro on March 9, 1994.\n\nAt Ease in Tarragona\n\nby Margaret Koger\n\nI’m barefoot, standing on wet sand as waves froth white at my ankles.\n\nI tug my strapless a little higher as others exult au naturel in the sun.\n\nI wait for the Med to lift me. The man I’ve come lately to love shed\n\nhis fear of naked flesh soon after our Idaho childhoods. He swims\n\nas old Sol and his salty sister re-source us.\n\nHow did I child in Central Cove, Idaho and adult on the Platja Savinosa?\n\nWhence the Sant Jordi Hotel? (Saint George ready slay Spanish dragons?)\n\nI see myself at three or five or seven crossing a black asphalt border\n\nto hear stories—Helen’s hurricanes, her romance with Danny the Basque\n\nhow the old country suffers, money so scarce, sons sent away.\n\nIs this where my wanderlust began? Or were Robert Louis Stevenson’s rhymes\n\n“At the Sea-Side,” and “Away all Boats” in a garden of verses already my future?\n\n“The Land of Nod” and a “Pirate Story”? Yes! Derring-do, swashbuckling me\n\nKidnapped with David Balfour and Ransome washing up on Treasure Island\n\nperchance to roam the Cévennes in France with a donkey carrying my bags.\n\nMy mind a puzzle map of distant shores, not just a country girl forever\n\nharboring sea dreams, dreams held at bay by family anchors until finally\n\nonce, twice, and then again to Barcelona, to ramble along the Ramblas\n\ncanaries in cages, scented flower stalls, buskers’ weddings, Picasso prints,\n\nbeer, and men harmonizing in the Barri Gòtic.\n\nSo, the map. Why not try Tarragona? Where Roman ships harbored in Tarraco\n\nHispania Tarraconensis, one of the most important cities of the empire\n\nwhere the amphitheater roared with lions as crowds of citizens howled for blood\n\nAugustus meanwhile reclining in a lavish villa; a time-travel view of antiquity\n\nso easily accessible by rail. Yes, why not?\n\nOh Tarragona! Why so comforting? Mornings at the Sant Jordi, old Domingo’s\n\nforty years of service, shuffling now, baskets of sticky croissants and butter,\n\ncafé con leche? Yes, and orange juice—before we watch rabbits and goats\n\nscamper across the scrub hillside below. Tarragona, where Sol and his sister\n\nsea renew us, for the sea is fecund, enlivening even when wind whips\n\nthe waves into twisted breakers and the surf swells, stealing sweetness\n\nfrom the beach. Then we stroll the Rambla Nova, eye ships waiting\n\nroadstead to enter the crowded harbor, step down into the amphitheater\n\nphotograph the monumental ombú tree, and rest beside the hippodrome,\n\nimagining chariot races, dramas, circuses, and 30,000 roaring Romans.\n\nBy sunset we hunger for Sant Jordi’s calm, to gaze out to sea, hoping\n\nto return next year, hoping to hear summer singing its universal song.\n\nPHOTO: Tarragona, Spain.

Founded before the 5th century BC, it is the capital of the Province of Tarragona. The city has a population of 201,199 (2014).

Miller\n\nto Charles Ives and his symphonic cataclysm\n\nThe trumpets and drums of “Putnam’s Camp”\n\ntopple over each other in a race toward high-\n\nsteppin’ small-town holiday promenade\n\nand its irresistible brass detonation.\n\n“The Housatonic at Stockbridge”: an immersed\n\norchestral mass, recollected river swelling\n\nfrom flow and eddy, to inundate, climax\n\nand fall back. A sigh before silence.\n\nTwo of Ives’ Three Places in New England\n\nrise a quarter mile in present sound,\n\nreach my black iron table and chair\n\non a Lenox inn porch. Out of the arched throat\n\nof the Shed at Tanglewood, past the highway\n\nskirting a margin of Stockbridge, uphill\n\nthrough the apple trees. Music, filtered\n\nby landscape, diffused into roofless sky.\n\nAn inchoate tonal pile, I follow this with water\n\nhinting at the corners of my eyes,\n\nbecause I know these contrary harmonies\n\nfrom the vinyl I spun at age twelve,\n\ngazing through the living room window\n\nat our own home mountain vision.\n\nMr. Ives, if only you could hear this\n\nwith me, tangled with the traffic below,\n\nthe clatter of breakfast gathered\n\nfrom metal tables by summer workers,\n\nChairs scraped back into place\n\nacross the vintage painted wood\n\nbraided with soprano confidences\n\nregarding some kitchen contretemps.\n\nThe glory of your all-of-it-at-once,\n\nCharles, that divine discord.\n\nOriginally published in The Poetry Porch, 2020\n\nPHOTO: The Apple Tree Inn, Lennox, Massachusetts.\n\nNOTE: Apple Tree Inn is located in the heart of the Berkshires in Lenox, Massachusetts. The property is host to an 1885 Victorian-style manor situated on 22 acres of rolling hills facing Stockbridge Bowl (Lake Mahkeenac).\n\nNOTE FROM THE AUTHOR: This poem was written at Apple Tree Inn, Lenox, Massachusetts, in August 2019. I was sitting on the breakfast porch, and sounds from the Boston Symphony Orchestra’s morning rehearsal filtered uphill. The music itself described the part of the world where I sat.\n\nPHOTO: The author at Apple Tree Inn, Lennox, Massachusetts (2019).\n\nABOUT THE AUTHOR: David P.

Now,\n\nit cannot locate our hotel,\n\ncommands us to turn\n\ninto oncoming traffic, leads us\n\ntwo times around the outskirts\n\nand back to where we started.\n\nMy young son is driving.\n\nSoon it will be dark. I am anxious,\n\nthen remember to ask the angels,\n\nwho await our pleas for help.\n\nUnder my breath, I ask.\n\nAt that exact second,\n\nwhen my petition has just slipped\n\nfrom my lips,\n\nthe system reroutes itself,\n\nguides us directly to the plaza\n\nand our hotel on top of the hill.\n\nPHOTO: Street of the Casco Antiguo, Arcos de la Frontera, Andalucia, Spain.

Take picture yes.\n\nYou touch beast?”\n\nHe roused the child so Ferdy and I waded\n\nto tap out fingers lightly on the scales\n\nfor our camera\n\nentrusted to our host.\n\nWe shared the pictures\n\nwith the crocodile’s groggy playmate\n\nwho rubbed her eyes\n\nto see Polaroid magic.\n\nFerdy interpreted the old man’s Indonesian for me:\n\n“Eight year ago, I fish River\n\nand catch baby crocodile in my net.\n\nWe eat not crocodile\n\nwhen the fish are many,\n\nso I throw it back in water,\n\nbut I hear cry like baby orang,\n\nhuman baby.\n\nI fish more, and again net bring crocodile\n\nto my boat,\n\nand again I hold its tail to throw in River,\n\nwhen I see it cry. And then of course I know\n\ncrocodile is twin, is person.”\n\nFerdy explained for me:\n\n“Country people drown second girl\n\nwhen twins are born,\n\nbecause twins are bad luck, even in Sumatra\n\nwith my Batak tribe still,\n\nbut sometimes baby fight to live\n\nand gods help.\n\nThey turn baby into animal. The old man he say:\n\n“‘So I take her home. We feed her\n\nas we feed my granddaughter\n\nwho has same age.\n\nShe eat not food of crocodile,\n\nonly food of my granddaughter.’”\n\nThe old man laughed,\n\nsaid to me in English,\n\n“She is person. They are as sisters now yes.\n\n“We call her Setia.” Faithfulness,\n\nFerdy translated. “And she thank my family\n\nwith luck and fortune.”\n\nWe left a gift of rupiah.\n\nAboard our boat again, I asked Ferdy\n\nif he believes.\n\n“The people believe,” he said.\n\n“But you? You wear a university ring on your finger,\n\nyou are no animist. What do you\n\nbelieve?”\n\n“I believe what I see.\n\nYou not?”\n\nI laughed, pressed him for logic, reason\n\nbeyond reasons.\n\n“‘That is my opinion,’ in Indonesia we say, ‘You have yours.’”\n\nAnd Ferdy bore me deeper down the Mahakam,\n\ninto the Borneo jungle.\n\nPHOTO: Village on the Mahakam River, East Kalimantan, Indonesia, Borneo.

It is the only island in the world to be politically administered by three countries at once. Approximately 73% of the island is Indonesian territory. In the north, the East Malaysian states of Sabah and Sarawak make up about 26% of the island. The sovereign state of Brunei, located on the north coast, comprises about 1% of Borneo’s land area. A little more than half of the island is in the Northern Hemisphere, including Brunei and the Malaysian portion, while the Indonesian portion spans the Northern and Southern hemispheres.\n\nMAP: Location of Borneo in Southeast Asia.\n\nNOTE FROM THE AUTHOR: One of the best trips my partner Ferdy and I ever took in Indonesia was a week’s journey on a motorboat, with pilot, guide, and cook, down the Mahakam River in Kalimantan, Indonesia’s piece of Borneo. I narrate exactly what I saw and heard at the most intriguing of our stops along the shore in the poem “Setia,” originally published in Pacific International 30 years ago!\n\nPHOTO: Setia with visitors (from left) Ferdy and river guide, along with the little girl she lives with.\n\nABOUT THE AUTHOR: A native New Yorker, James Penha has lived for the past quarter-century in Indonesia.

Ehrlich\n\nA perfect day begins the night before.\n\nA mackerel net is set in a fireball of a setting sun.\n\nUp at dawn before marauding seals\n\nhave cleaned off the catch,\n\nI fillet them on the shore tossing bloody entrails\n\nto screeching gulls hovering overhead\n\nI deliver a feed to my neighbors and friends.\n\nI’m awed by the grandeur of pristine air\n\nand sun-flooded clouds as white as a linen wedding dress.\n\nIn a sky lit from behind by a quintessential blueness,\n\nI gather wild strawberries for breakfast.\n\nI munch on June Ellen’s homemade granola\n\nand one of her gargantuan cowboy-cookies.\n\nI cruise across St Mary’s Bay in a Boston Whaler\n\nto snorkel off Wheeler’s Bar at low tide for the mother lode\n\nof bar-clams and maybe even poach a lobster or a bushel\n\nof hefty crabs.\n\nWhile mackerel and beer-soaked corn are on the grill,\n\nI’ll down a few Mooseheads, before sauntering along\n\nthe shore eyeballing red foxes, who sit like Cheshire cats\n\nin front of an old lobster box.\n\nIt was used as a table when they were fed by Leonard,\n\nwho is now propped up on a throne of pillows.\n\nHis glazed eyes still search the horizon for his nemesis,\n\nthe seal, his shotgun at the ready, only now, it’s just a cane.\n\nI’m reassured to still see herons, sentinels of the bay,\n\nstanding on one leg, hunting for morsels of the sea.\n\nA bevy of piping plovers and terns tiptoe on the sandy shore\n\nin a flurry of white feathers nattering with ospreys, gulls\n\nand cormorant cronies.\n\nScattering crows, squawking chanticleers cackle,\n\ncaw-cawing ahead of me.\n\nI see apparitions of driftwood jungle-creatures,\n\na gallery of sculptures even Rodin and Giacometti might envy:\n\nA horse head with knots for chestnut eyes, a gnarled octopus\n\ncurled around cattail punks reaching for the sky, an elephant\n\nwith a broken tusk plunked in plush maidenhair marsh-fern\n\nas if it were a grove where elephants go to die.\n\nA gaunt giraffe feeds on fluttering green leaves\n\nhigh up in an aspen’s branches, a reindeer’s\n\nbleached white antlers protrude in rust-colored clay\n\nand verdant kelp.\n\nA unicorn dips his horn into the swirling Gasperaux,\n\nsweetening the gushing freshet flow\n\nso smelt can leave the estuary and breed in the sea.\n\nA slow walk in the labyrinthine shallow water\n\nempties my mind into quietness.\n\nmonitor the underwater show:\n\nunder lucent plankton, schools of silver minnows flash by.\n\nBarnacle-covered fiddler crabs careen sideways\n\nlike inebriated pals, a pair of small red fish\n\nstealthily lumber along resembling twin submarines.\n\nI step over cracked carapaces, steamers\n\nand chipped blue mussels\n\nrevealing an opalescent inner layer.\n\nSuddenly, I’m dazzled by a four-foot eel darting away\n\ninto emerald green eel grass,\n\nreminding me of how Leonard once trapped a slew\n\nof squirming eels, nailing them to a bench, skinning\n\nand smoking them for shipment to a Bavarian Rathskeller.\n\nOn the way back I see my father’s profile in a passing cloud\n\nand feel an ache of regret that such an avid fisherman\n\nnever got to visit my paradisial bay.\n\nObserving my shadow I reflect on how ephemeral\n\nand transient we are, and how elusive moments\n\nof perfect happiness can be. I also wonder\n\nhow come my shadow is so much taller than me.\n\nMy perfect day ends slumbering in an old iron bed\n\nwith creaking springs that once cranked out\n\na progeny of eighteen They made do with a hand pump\n\nand a two-seat outhouse, still standing next to the barn\n\nlisting to the side like a slowly sinking ship.\n\nPHOTO: Cormorants perched on pier pilings, Prince Edward Island, Canada. Photo by Rixie.\n\nNOTE FROM THE AUTHOR: There is no more beautiful destination than Prince Edward Island, Canada. This poem recounts a day in the life on the island.\n\nNOTE: Prince Edward Island is located in the Gulf of St. Lawrence, west of Cape Breton Island, north of the Nova Scotia peninsula, and east of New Brunswick. Its southern shore bounds the Northumberland Strait. The island has two urban areas, and in total, is the most densely populated province in Canada. The island’s landscape is pastoral, with wooded areas and rolling hills. The coastline has a combination of long beaches, dunes, red sandstone cliffs, salt water marshes, and numerous bays and harbors.\n\nMAP: Prince Edward Island circled in red.\n\nABOUT THE AUTHOR: Milton P. Ehrlich Ph.D. is an 89-year-old psychologist and a veteran of the Korean War. He has published poems in Poetry Review, The Antigonish Review, London Grip, Arc Poetry Magazine, Descant Literary Magazine, Wisconsin Review, Red Wheelbarrow, and The New York Times.\n\nIn the Piazza del Duomo, Florence, Italy\n\nby Wilda Morris\n\nOn this cool November night, I sit at an outside café\n\nsurrounded on two sides by five-foot glass walls.\n\nFrom here, I can see the Baptistery, a corner\n\nof the Giotto’s bell tower. Beyond the Duomo\n\nwith its red-orange dome, my view is obscured\n\nby chocolates reflected from a store window.\n\nThe piazza is alive with parents pushing strollers,\n\ntourists from a dozen nations dragging suitcases,\n\nsnapping selfies on cell phones. Photographers\n\nfocus Nikons and Canons. A police car backs out.\n\nBicycles weave between pedestrians. A toddler\n\nclinging to a big red balloon rides her father’s shoulder.\n\nLeashed black labs sniff each other; the owners\n\nlaugh, say ciao. and begin to chat.\n\nThe young donna in short skirt twirls\n\ntoward the suave young man as his dog\n\nlicks his leg. They compare canine companions.\n\nHe grins as he tells her a tale about his.\n\nShe waves goodbye and starts to go, pulling\n\non her leash. He calls her back. After more talk,\n\nshe puts his number in her cell phone, he puts hers\n\nin his. My lasagna went cold as I watched\n\nsomething warm between them.\n\nPHOTO: Piazza del Duomo, Florence, Italy (2017). Photo by Runoman.\n\nNOTE FROM THE AUTHOR: On my first trip to Italy, I had to choose between Florence and Venice, and picked Venice. It hurt my heart when the train went past Florence, though, and I didn’t get to experience any of that wonderful city. When I had an opportunity to attend a writing workshop in Orvieto, I added several days in Florence to my itinerary. Early one evening, I ordered dinner at a sidewalk cafe in the Piazza del Duomo. Before I went back to the hostel where I was staying, I drafted this poem about my experience there. It is different from my poems about the cathedral, the art galleries, and the Arno River, but it records a fond memory.\n\nABOUT THE AUTHOR: Wilda Morris, Workshop Chair, Poets and Patrons of Chicago, and past President of the Illinois State Poetry Society, enjoys traveling as much as writing. She has published over 650 poems in anthologies, webzines, and print publications. She has won awards for formal and free verse and haiku. Her most recent collection is Pequod Poems: Gamming with Moby-Dick (Kelsay Books, 2019). Her poetry blog at wildamorris.blogspot features a monthly poetry contest.\n\nPHOTO: The author on the roof of the cathedral in Florence, Italy, a few years ago.\n\nHome of the Desert Rat\n\nby Robert Coats\n\n…I shall give myself\n\nto the desert again—that I, in its golden dust\n\nmay be blown from a barren peak,\n\nbroadcast over the sun-lands…\n\n—Maynard Dixon, 1935\n\nThree arms of a cloud fuse to form an arrow\n\npointing at the summit of Picacho Peak,\n\nits flanks of red-orange rock\n\nriven by deep arroyos.\n\nThe shack of the Desert Rat is darkened\n\nby a cliff’s shadow thrown across the terrace.\n\nBehind the shack, the steep bank of a desert wash\n\nand nearby, a Model T,\n\na copse of scraggly cottonwood.\n\nWhat wound would drive\n\na man to live here in solitude?\n\nPerhaps at Belleau Wood\n\nhe saw comrades blown to bits.\n\nOr returned home from work to find\n\nhis house in flames, his young wife\n\nand baby trapped inside.\n\nIn the late afternoon light\n\nhe walks across the boulder-strewn terrace\n\nto watch the mountain’s purple shadows\n\ndrawing long.\n\nAt night he steps out to gaze\n\nat the Milky Way’s long shawl\n\nilluminating\n\nthe vast and silent sky.\n\nPAINTING: Home of the Desert Rat by Maynard Dixon (1944-1945), Phoenix Art Museum.\n\nNOTE FROM THE AUTHOR: This is an ekphrastic poem; that is, a poem about a painting or photograph. Maynard Dixon (1875-1946) was a well-known painter who lived and worked in the American Southwest, painting the landscapes and people of the region, including many Native Americans. During the last years of his life, he and his third wife (Edith Hamlin) divided their time between Mount Carmel, Utah, and Tucson, Arizona. By the time of this painting, Dixon was struggling with emphysema, and his mobility was reduced. ¶ The exact location where Dixon set up his easel is unknown, but the available evidence—the chevron pattern on the side of the mountain, the shape of the summit, and the deep arroyo at its base—indicates that the mountain is Picacho Peak, 40 miles northwest of Tucson. But, curiously, the red-orange color (typical of Utah sandstone) and lack of vegetation on the mountain do not match what is shown in the image on Google Earth. Picacho Peak is basalt, a black volcanic rock, and its vegetation is typical of the Sonoran Desert. We know that Dixon was very fond of the red sandstone landscapes, so it seems likely that his choice of color made use of his well-earned artistic license.\n\nABOUT THE AUTHOR: Robert Coats has been writing poetry for more than 40 years. Aside from four poems previously published by Poetry and Places, his poems have appeared on the Canary Website, in Orion, Zone 3, Windfall, Song of the San Joaquin, in two anthologies (Fresh Water: Poems from the Rivers, Lakes and Streams and Fire and Rain: Ecopoetry of California), in the hand-printed and bound book Gathering Black Walnuts from Cedar Fence Press, and in his book The Harsh Green World, published by Sugartown Publishing. He is a Research Hydrologist with the UC Davis Tahoe Environmental Research Center."
