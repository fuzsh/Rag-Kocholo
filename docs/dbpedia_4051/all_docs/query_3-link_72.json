This action was directly against the terms which Germany had accepted after the First World War. This move, in terms of foreign relations, threw the European allies, especially France and Britain, into confusion. What should they do about it?\n\nAnthony Eden was the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs and Stanley Baldwin the Prime Minister at the time.\n\nUse the Foreign Office documents in this lesson from March 11th 1936 to find out about the motives and attitudes of the British government as they discuss their options.\n\nTasks\n\nBackground\n\nAccording to the Treaty of Versailles, the Rhineland, a strip of land inside Germany bordering on France, Belgium and the Netherlands, was to be de-militarised. That is, no German troops were to be stationed inside that area or any fortifications built. The aim was to increase French security by making it impossible for Germany to invade France unawares. Other terms restricted the German army to 100,000 men and the navy to just 36 ships. Germany objected to the terms of the treaty but were told to sign it or the war would begin again.\n\nThe Treaty of Versailles also set up the League of Nations, an international peace-keeping organisation. It was based on the idea of collective security, that is, the nations of the world would act together (collectively) to preserve peace. Unfortunately, one of the most powerful, the USA, did not join the League.\n\nGermany in the 1920s was keen to get back on normal terms with other nations and signed the Treaty of Locarno. By this treaty Germany agreed to accept the terms of the Versailles Treaty, at least on her western borders. France continued to worry about their safety against Germany particularly after Adolf Hitler became Chancellor of Germany in 1933. He had always declared his firm intention of overthrowing the Treaty of Versailles and uniting all Germans in one country, even if it led to war. Germany began to re-arm. Could France trust collective security, or should they find military allies?\n\nIn May 1935 France signed a treaty of friendship and mutual support with the USSR. Germany claimed the treaty was hostile to them and Hitler used this as an excuse to send German troops into the Rhineland in March 1936, contrary to the terms of the treaties of Versailles and Locarno. It was a gamble on his part and his generals were nervous about it. German re-armament had not yet reached a point where they felt ready to take on a well-armed nation like France.\n\nFollowing the discussions described in the documents, the British Foreign Secretary, Anthony Eden, did indeed meet the German ambassador and make his proposals. Hitler refused to withdraw his troops, and put pressure on the League of Nations to act. France was on the verge of a general election and would not act without Britain’s support. However the British people felt that the Treaty of Versailles was unfair on Germany and was over-restrictive, and so partly because of this, the British government decided to do nothing. Hitler moved on from the occupation of the Rhineland in 1936, to the annexation of Austria and the seizure of the Sudetenland in 1938, to the take-over of the rest of Czechoslovakia in March 1939 and then Poland in September 1939.\n\nTeachers' notes\n\nExternal links\n\nQuiz yourself on Adolf Hitler\n\nHow much do you know about Adolf Hitler and the rise of Nazism in Germany?\n\nThe German occupation/Re-militarization of the Rhineland\n\nVideo on the German re-occupation and militarization of the Rhineland.\n\nWhat’s the context? 1 December 1925: signing the Locarno Treaties\n\nA blog on the Locarno Treaties which gives further context for sources.\n\nConnections to curriculum\n\nKey stage 3\n\nChallenges for Britain, Europe and the wider world 1901 to the present day: the inter-war years: the Great Depression and the rise of dictators\n\nKey stage 4\n\nAQA GCSE History: Germany, 1890–1945: Democracy and dictatorship\n\nEdexcel GCSE History: c1900–present: Warfare and British society in modern era\n\nOCR GCSE History: War and British Society c.790 to c.2010; attitudes and responses to war\n\nBack to top"
