        "text": "Schindelmeiser: What does the surname Schindelmeiser mean?\n\nThe surname Schindelmeiser is of German origin. It is derived from the German word ‘schindel’ meaning ‘shingle’ or ‘roof tile’ and the word ‘meiser’ which means ‘steward’.

It is thought that the surname was initially given to someone who managed a roof-making business or oversaw the shingle-making process.\n\nThe surname Schindelmeiser is relatively rare, so there is limited information available about its history.
