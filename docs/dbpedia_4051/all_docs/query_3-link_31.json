        "text": "I’m currently studying Highland Gaels due to a branch of my family ancestry, and also as the subject of my next historical novel. In the process, I’ve happened upon the Hidden Glen Folk School, established by Dr. Michael Newton, Ph.D. to recover the best of Highland Gaelic tradition through Gaelic histories, songs, stories, poems, language, and practices. The school has been a breakthrough for me as I endeavor to sort through distinctions between Highland Scots, Lowland Scots, and the Scots-Irish.\n\nThrough a Hidden Glen classmate, I’ve learned something not on my radar — the “Irish Palatines.” Seriously? Irish Germans? Is that really a thing? Yes, it is.\n\nThe term Palatines, or people of the Palatinate (German Pfalz), refers to people living in a region of southwest Germany. According to Britannica,\n\nThe Rhenish Palatinate included lands on both sides of the middle Rhine River between its Main and Neckar tributaries. Its capital until the 18th century was Heidelberg. … The boundaries of the Palatinate varied with the political and dynastic fortunes of the counts palatine.\n\nDid they ever. This Sunday, April 3, I’ll be presenting a webinar on the topic Explore the Rhineland-Palatinate for the Irish Palatine Special Interest group of the Ontario Genealogical Society and will give an overview of those “political and dynastic fortunes,” wars, religious persecutions, and more. (Click here for more info and to register.)\n\nNow for the Irish part. In the early 1700s in the Palatinate, after devastating scorched-earth wars, famine, and religious persecution, many Palatines had grown desperate. Enter Protestant Queen Anne of England (1702-1714) who viewed the Protestant Palatines as victims of religious persecution, and also sought to increase the number of Protestant subjects then in Ireland. Meanwhile, due to reports that a better life awaited in North America, the thoughts of the Palatine peasants “were turned toward America [in part] through what seemed like an invitation from Queen Anne of England to settle in her transatlantic colonies.” [from Don Heinrich Tolzmann’s book, The German American Experience, p. 57] By October of 1709 about 15,000 Palatines had voyaged to London with hopes of settling in British America. They became known by the English as the “poor Palatines.” Never mind that fewer than half were Palatines.\n\nNo more than half of the so-called German Palatines originated in the namesake Electoral Palatinate, with others coming from the surrounding imperial states of Palatinate-Zweibrücken and Nassau-Saarbrücken, the Margraviate of Baden, the Hessian Landgraviates of Hesse-Darmstadt, Hesse-Homburg, Hesse-Kassel, the Archbishoprics of Trier and Mainz, and various minor counties of Nassau, Sayn, Solms, Wied, and Isenburg. [From German Palatines, on Wikipedia]\n\nAlso never mind that they weren’t all Protestants. Apparently some 2,000 were Catholics (from Wikipedia “German Palatines,” see link above). In any event,\n\nOver 800 families, comprising more than 3000 people, were sent on to Ireland between September 1709 and January 1710. Most left again within a few years, for England or America, but 150 families settled in Rathkeale, County Limerick and thrived in the production of hemp, flax and cattle. A second successful settlement of Palatine families took hold near Gorey in Co. Wexford around the same period. [from Goethe Institute’s “Irish Palatines”]\n\nThese persons were among the first wave of Palatine emigrants. Surnames of the persons sent to Ireland in this era can be found at the Library Ireland website.\n\nHistorical Novel Society North America 2021 conference\n\nI’ll be presenting at the June 21-27 Historical Novel Society North America Conference, a full week of online activities where attendees can learn, share, connect, and inspire. Over 80 panels, presentations, and cozy chats, plus master classes, author spotlights, book clubs, conversation rooms, and social events. You can also sign up for agent pitches, query critiques, and the Blue Pencil Cafe. My topic is “All Is Not Lost: Making the Most of your Research.” Click here for the full program of events and offerings. Registration is now open.\n\n2021 International German Genealogy Conference\n\nComing in July: International German Genealogy Partnership (IGGP) conference. I be presenting two talks: one on “Explore the Rhineland Palatinate,” the other — “Following the Trail: Emigrant letters of the 19th Century” with my German colleague Angela Weber. Held online in real time July 17-24, presentations will also be available to watch at home at your convenience for the next six months, through December. This conference is the third one offered by the IGGP. They’re well organized and have a great line up of offerings. Don’t miss out! Registration deadline May 1.\n\nOh my! the book How We Survive Here has been out for a year now, and it’s been a wonderful ride. It’s always nice to hear from readers. Several people have commented to me, “It’s a great read. I was right there with you the whole way.”\n\nThe book is the story of my quest to trace and write about my ancestors, which culminated in the historical novel The Last of the Blacksmiths (2014). In addition to being a memoir, the book How We Survive Here also includes letter translations by my German cousin, Angela Weber, making the letters available for the first time to genealogists and scholars.\n\nDating between 1841 and 1908, the letters are written from Cleveland to Freinsheim, Germany, by Philipp Henrich Handrich (1), Jakob Handrich (1), Michael Harm (23), Michael Höhn (1), and Johann Rapparlie (7). So many other surnames are mentioned. German immigration to Cleveland in the 19th century is a prime example of chain migration. After the first people came and got established, others from the same village followed.\n\nIn the back of How We Survive Here, I’ve included an index with page numbers noting where various names are mentioned.

Celebrity princesses holding court behind a wine-tasting counter, pouring out sips from jewel-tinted bottles of wine? Not exactly. Here’s how it worked.\n\nThe Urlaubsregion Freinsheim (think chamber of commerce, German-style) organizes a wine-tasting to five different villages in and around the region, guided by the wine princesses from each of five villages. Each princess introduces two wines unique to her village. In our case, the tour included: a Riesling and a dry Weisburgunder in Weisenheim am Sand, Viognier and Grauburgunder in Erpolzheim, Chardonnay and Rose in Herxheim, Auxerrois and Cuvée in Weisenheim am Berg, and white and red Spätburgunders (Pinot Noirs) in Freinsheim.\n\nBut pictures say it best.\n\nIn our family tree, 19th century ancestor Johann Philipp Harm, the father of Michael Harm, married twice. Johann Philipp’s first marriage in 1827 was to a woman named Elisabetha Harm Bruch, a widow more than ten years older than he was, and his first cousin. This first wife passed away in 1832, childless, when Johann Philipp Harm was just 36 years old.\n\n“We think this first marriage was about property,” Günter told me on my first visit to Freinsheim in 1988. “To keep Elisabetha’s property in the family.”\n\nA hint to a mystery, passed down from generation to generation, which may have its source in Code Napoleon civil laws.\n\nElisabetha and Johann married in the late 1820s, a time after Napoleon had been driven back from the Pfalz. Nonetheless, a version of the Code Napoleon, a unified set of laws on personal and property rights, had endured, including laws of equal inheritance for male and female alike. So if family lore is correct, Elisabetha Harm may have inherited property from her deceased husband? Or from her parents after they’d died? (Her parents would have been Johann Philipp Harm’s Uncle and Aunt.) If she’d had other siblings (I don’t know), they would have received an equal share.\n\nOn the other hand, when it comes to women’s rights, Elisabetha’s marriage to Johann makes little sense. The Code Napoleon was a blow to the revolutionary era’s progress on the equal rights of women.\n\nIn post Revolution France, the ideas of female equality received a setback in a series of laws known as the Napoleonic Code. Through it, the legal right of men to control women was affirmed. Although most of the basic revolutionary gains – equality before the law, freedom of religion and the abolition of feudalism – remained, the Code ensured that married women in particular owed their husband obedience, and were forbidden from selling, giving, mortgaging or buying property.\n\n–from ‘The Wife is Obliged‘\n\nWhich begs the question, why on earth would Elisabetha have married Johann Philipp, her cousin not her lover, solely to turn over control of her property to him. So he would work her land for them both? If they did marry to keep the land in the family, what would have happened to the land if Elisabetha had never married? Did the government have right of succession?\n\nAh, a tangled web of mysteries. Ideas, anyone?\n\nThe last time I visited Freinsheim was the fall of 2010 during the annual “Wine Hike” / Weinwanderung. (Ostensibly, I was there to research my novel, but hey, a girl can have fun too, right?)\n\nSoon I’ll be headed back there, about the same time of year, but so much in my life has changed. I’ve studied more German, for one thing. I feel as if I’m so much closer to my relatives, for another. But most of all, I’ve now made the leap from aspiring writer to published author. The book I went there to research — relying on Freinsheimer hospitality for a whole month! — has become a reality.\n\nAnd they’re setting up a book talk for me, while I’m there, in a renovated old hospital that is now used as a cultural venue. My presentation will be Monday, October 6 at 7:00 p.m. I’ll talk about my book (hopefully in German) and read from it, and will have help from my relatives during the Q&A. Heartfelt thanks to the Weber family for setting this up. A link to the announcement of the event (in German) is here.\n\nWhen I visited the Pfalz region of Germany, I especially enjoyed the wines. The Rieslings are crisp, not cloying, the Spätburgunder is as fine as a good Pinot Noir, and the sparkling Sekt is equal in quality to French champagne.\n\nWine-making is so ubiquitous to the culture and lifestyle of the Pfalz, the entire cellar of the Bad Dürkheim Heimatsmuseum is dedicated to a viticulture exhibit. The rack shown here is an example of the traditional method of fermenting champagne. According to the Heimatsmuseum curator, it was an iffy proposition — 10- to 20-percent of the bottles could be counted on to explode, the champagne wasted.\n\nWines from the Bad Dürkheim region were exported to Cleveland in the 19th century, thanks to the Dürkheimer wine-makers George and John Fitz and a Cleveland wine importer named Leick of Kirchheimbolanden. (Apparently Leick and his brother married the Hege sisters from Dürkheim, so a connection was made.)\n\nIn particular, the Fitz brothers produced the 1848 Dürkheimer Firemountain label especially for export. Records show the wine was also exported to New York City, Cleveland and New York City being areas with high Palatine immigrant populations. While the year on a label normally indicates the vintage, in this case, all wines carried this year. The year 1848 was a reference to the 1848 Revolution for democracy, the Fitz brothers reaching out in solidarity to exiles forced to immigrate to America after the revolution was crushed. It’s not clear how long the 1848 label lasted. But wine exports continued until Prohibition brought an end to the once lucrative trade.\n\nThese days, the Mosel region seems to dominate German wine imports to the U.S. However, I recently stumbled on a delightful surprise. The Fitz wine-makers of Bad Dürkheim are still in business. Now called the Fitz-Ritter Winery, the history of their revolutionary 19th century activities is even posted proudly on their website:\n\nSEKT – SPARKLING WINE WITH DEMOCRATIC ROOTS\n\nIn 1837, the Fitz estate founded the first “Champagne“ Production in the Palatinate (second in all of Germany). Johannes Fitz, known as “the Red Fitz,” had imported the necessary know-how from the Champagne region of France which had been his exile home following his activity for the German Democracy movement at the Hambach Festival in 1832.\n\nFive years later the first „Palatine Champagne“ emerged from the Bad Dürkheim winery. …Just as it was back then, today the Sektkellerei Fitz (Sekt is the German word for sparkling wine) still produces “Sekt” from Burgundy and Riesling wines by traditional bottle fermentation.\n\nNo wonder the Fitz wine-makers reached out to those suffering exile in 1848–John Fitz had been an exile himself in 1832. I checked into it, and the Fitz-Ritter wines are again being exported to the U.S. Oh happy day!\n\nOn any visit to Freinsheim, Germany, one of the first stops on the “wall walk,” a tour of the narrow corridor that rings the old inner wall, is always at the former home of Hermann Sinsheimer. I snapped this photo of the house (if you look closely, you’ll see the resident cat in the window) and the accompanying stone-etched plaque that adorns the facade on my first day in Freinsheim in September, 2010. Roughly translated, the plaque reads:\n\nThe lawyer, writer, and journalist Hermann Sinsheimer was born in this house on the 6th of March 1883. His passion for theater and literature before 1933 drove him to write what he observed of German cultural life. Also, what he wrote in exile was influenced by his happy childhood in Freinsheim. He died far from home, in London, in 1950.\n\nA more complete write-up of the life of Hermann Sinsheimer can be found here, at the AJR (Association of Jewish Refugees) Journal.\n\nWhile Herman Sinsheimer has languished in obscurity for decades, of late, several books have been published of his work. One is the letters of Hermann Sinsheimer, written while he was in England back to his friend Frida Schaffner in Freinsheim. Dr. Hans-Helmut Görtz edited these letters with Erik and Gabriele Giersberg. They’ve been published in a comprehensive book Briefe aus England in die Pfalz. The book (768 p., hardcover, many photographs) is edited by the Stiftung zur Förderung der Pfälzischen Geschichtsforschung in Neustadt an der Weinstraße. It costs 49 Euros. Whoever is interested in buying a copy should send Dr. Görtz an email at hhgoertz@t-online.de.\n\nAnother book, just released and available on Amazon-UK, is an uncensored release of Sinsheimer’s 1953 autobiography Gelebt Im Paradies, published in 2013 by Deborah Vietor-Engländer. This book includes Sinsheimer’s childhood reminiscences, his reflections on anti-Semitism, on accounts of his days in Munich and Berlin, and of living in exile with fellow German Jewish refugees in England during and after the war. The book is available here: Amazon.co.UK.\n\nThe book jacket reads (translated from the German):\n\nHermann Sinsheimer (1883-1950), theater director, theater critic, editor of Simplicissimus and editor of the Berliner Tageblatt, wrote his autobiography “Gelebt im Paradies” in the Palatinate, in Munich and later in Berlin, completing it during his exile in England starting in 1938. In the book, he provides portraits of his contemporaries, from Erich Mühsam to Joachim Ringelnatz, from Alfred Kerr to Frank Wedekind.\n\nWas Germany once a paradise? In Sinsheimer’s youth in the Palatinate, certainly, but in retrospect in exile Sinsheimer also reveals the fullness of the paradise lost he suffered during his years in Munich and Berlin, the destruction he witnessed, and his insights and memories of historical events.\n\nLived in Paradise is a first release, because here the text kept out of the 1953 imprint has been returned in its original, uncensored form, to properly stock the shelves of German literature. Sinsheimer’s autobiographical essay Deutschland, not included previously, is a document free of hate, a reflection of the exile as he considers German thinking of tomorrow. This text is published here for the first time in German. The political writer reflects on what happened, why the Germans could have done what they did, driving the Jews, including large parts of the scientific and artistic intelligentsia, out of the country. In 1942, Sinsheimer asks: What should be done after the war with Germany is lost?\n\nYes, the book is in German, but if you dare, I highly recommend delving into the observations and insights of this thoughtful, courageous man."
