        "text": "My 2018 visit to Heidelberg’s Kurpfalzisches Museum, with its excellent Roman exhibit, inspired me to carry out some further research on the Celts, Germans and Romans in the area of Heidelberg in particular and in the surrounding Rhineland-Palatinate in general.\n\nPicturesque Heidelberg lies nestled by the Neckar river where it emerges from the wooded hills of the Odenwald into the Rhine plain of today’s southwestern Germany. Already by 550,000 BC, early man, homo heidelbergensis, inhabited the area. Celts from the early iron age Hallstatt culture, the Mediomatrici, moved in the 9th century BC from their homelands in what is today Germany, to settle west of the Rhine in the Ardennes Mountains.i Although the Mediomatrici capital was far to the west, at Metz (Divodorum “the citadel of the gods”), their realm stretched east to include Speyer (Spires Eng.) in the Rhineland-Palatinate. At Speyer the Mediomatrici worshiped the goddess Nantosuelta (meaning winding stream), who presided over birth, death and recuperation and was represented by a raven or by a woman with a birdhouse on a staff.ii\n\nDuring the fifth century BC, Celts of the late iron age La Tene culture (which succeeded the Hallstatt culture) build a stronghold on the Heiligenberg (Holy Mountain) across the River Neckar from today’s Heidelberg.iii The Celts gave the River Neckar its name, which meant “wild companion.”iv Mining iron ore in the hills of the Odenwald, the settlement grew rich and powerful.\n\nCirca 104-101 BC, a number of Germanic Cimbri and Teutones settled among the Belgae while the remainder of their tribe set out on their advance on Italy. Some of the Cimbri and Teutones remaining behind would later end up in the Rhineland-Palatinate and Heidelberg area.\n\nIn 70 BC,v the Nemetes, a Celtic-Germanic tribe, settled in the Mediomatrici’s eastern border along the Rhine. The Nemetes continued the veneration of Nantosuelta and also worshiped the goddess Nemetona at the healing waters and sacred grove on Rhine at Altrip. Nemetona, whose name means “sacred grove” was a dual healing and war goddess.vi\n\nIn 58 BC Caesar shattered the tribal Kingdom that Ariovistus had carved out of the Alsace region in Gaul with his Germanic Suebi confederation. In the aftermath, the Germanic Vangiones, Nemetes and Triboci continued to hold on to their Gallic conquests west of the Rhine but submit to Roman suzerainty. Eventually they were absorbed in the predominant Celtic culture.vii Other tribes of Ariovistus’ coalition chose to forgo Roman rule and settled east of the Rhine, where they too merged with Celtic culture.viii The Suebi Nicretes (Suebi of the Neckar)ix settled in the area of Lopodunum (Ladenburg) and the Toutoni (Teutones/Cimbri) by the Odenwald of Miltenberg and Heidelberg.x Votive statues dating from after Julius Caesar’s Gallic conquests, discovered in Roman territory along the Main river and in Baden, near Heidelberg, feature inscriptions indicating that the dedicators were Cimbri. Probably they were descendants of survivors from their tribe which had all but been wiped out by Marius in 101 BC.xi\n\nAround 5 BC, the Celts built a double rampart around the Heiligenberg where their stronghold had grown and prospered. Remains of the 5 km-long circular wall are still visible today, and were part of one of the largest Celtic fortifications in south-central Europe. Built of stone and wooden buttresses, the wall towered up to 5 m in height.xii\n\nAfter AD 70, as part of Vespasian’s policy of pushing the Roman frontier east of the upper Rhine, the Romans built forts in the area in the area of today’s Neuenheim and Bergheim, across the River Neckar from Heidelberg. The forts, originally of wood, were built of stone after AD 90. Among the cohorts garrisoned there was the 2nd Augusta Cyrenaica equitata. The first wooden pile bridge over the Neckar was built by the Romans to connect these forts to the southern bank. Around AD 200, architect Valerius Paternus replaced the wooden bridge with a 260m long stone one.xiii The fort at Neuenheim was held by Rome until it was lost to the Alemanni (Swabians) in AD 260.xiv The latter emerged in the third century in former Suebi territory east of the Rhine and south of the Main, and after multiple westward invasions spread into Alsace and south into the Alps.xv In 769, during the early Middle-Ages, the village of Bergheim (mountain home) was first mentioned.xvi\n\nExhibits in Heidelberg’s Kurpfalzisches Museum relating to the Celtic-Roman-Germanic period.\n\nRoman Freighter\n\nIn addition to the Roman high sea fleet, larger sailing vessels were used to transport goods along coastal waters and along rivers. Due to the depth of their loaded draft, such ships could only be sailed on the major rivers and up slow currents, otherwise they had to be pulled up stream. The high-swung stern of the freighter was often decorated by animal heads. Two large oars were used to steer the ship from atop the stern cabin. The cabin was reserved for the Magister navis (master of the ship), the captain, ship pilot, the senior helmsmen. The crew slept on deck, or if necessary, in the hold.\n\nRoman Burgus with Shipping Quay at Ladenburg\n\nAs part of Valentinian’s frontier defense strategy, in AD 369/70 the Romans built a burgus at the site of the abandoned Roman city of Lopodunum (Ladenburg) on the right bank of the Neckar River. Once the center of Roman presence in Upper Germania’s hinterland, Lopodunum, alongside the Neuenheim fort 10 km upriver, was lost during the collapse of the Limes in the mid third century AD. The burgus at Ladenburg controlled the Neckar passage and served as a Roman bridgehead east of the Rhine against the Alemanni.i The walls protecting the quay reached into the water, so that the quay was only accessible by ship. Landward, further walls enclosed a courtyard. The 18m-tall central tower dominated the burgus. The garrison likely numbered 45-50 men.ii The Ladenburg burgus was abandoned after AD 400.iii\n\nThe Spatha Sword\n\nThe spatha was introduced into the Roman army during the early imperial period by warriors from subjugated Celtic and Germanic tribes who served in Roman auxiliary units. They brought with them the spatha, the typical Celtic broad sword used by both ethnic groups which dated back to a long line of Celtic long bladed swords. The spatha was popular among the cavalry who appreciated its long reach. The double-sided blade measured 65 to 80 cm (2 feet to 2.9 feet). It was worn on a belt or from a baldric. One shortcoming of the spatha was that it was more likely to break in battle than the gladius hispanienses (the legionary short sword). Such broken blades were at times given a new point to be made into short swords. Starting in the late 2nd century AD, the spatha gradually replaced the gladius becoming the main side arm of the legionaries by the end of the third century.\n\nThe Shield Boss\n\nShow below, a shield boss from one of the Kircheim graves in the Heidelberg area. The bronze cast ornament is in shape of a Christian cross. The cross decorated armaments as well items used in daily life. To the Christian-pagan population of the Merovingian period, the cross was seen as both a defensive and healing symbol. During battle, the infantry man would lean their shoulders into the shield. Opposing shield walls would typically become tense shoving matches. Sword and spears slid through the tight openings, here and there drawing blood, but for the most part it became a contest of stamina. Behind the shield wall, their comrades threw missile weapons.\n\nWomen’s fashions in Roman Germania\n\nDuring the 1st century AD, women in the Roman occupied Heidelberg area dressed in a mix of Celtic, Germanic and Roman styles. A long-sleeved undergarment was worn beneath a sleeveless dress that reached to the ankles. The dress was made of a simple fabric cylinder pinned together at the shoulder by a brooch (fibula). Outdoors a cloak was worn, again featuring a shoulder fibula. The costume was further embellished with up to six additional gilded bronze fibulae.\n\nTwo to three generations later, fashion from the south inspired a more subdued tunic-like upper body garment and a cloak that was only slung over the upper arm and shoulder. The fibula’s practical function no longer necessary, the brooch became a purely decorative multi-colored jewelry piece.\n\nFashion trends in hairstyles and jewelry of female provincial residents sought to emulate those of the Imperial family, who were the trend setters. Curly hair was teased like the women of the Flavian emperors, or braided and combed backward like the Antonine empresses.\n\nEverything for beauty: Makeup and Jewelry\n\nUpper class Roman women devoted much time for the application of makeup. Among the most common makeups was white lead, which was used for a lighter complexion (a toxic substance, lead may have caused health problems with repeated and prolonged exposure). Wine yeast was used to redden the lips, crushed ant eggs to blacken the eye brows and rouge to blush the cheeks. With a bronze probe, the Roman lady took the makeup powder from a narrow necked glass, balsam from the balsamarium and mixed it together with saliva on a stone plate. The mixture was then dabbed onto the face and cheeks.\n\nBesides fibulas, jewelry of gold and silver with gemstones was worn, as well as amulets such as animal teeth, to ward off bad luck or bring good fortune. The Roman lady also loved pearls. Such luxuries were naturally more common at Rome than on the frontier, where bronze jewelry, highly polished to resemble gold, was commonly worn.\n\nImage: Photo L. Dyck, Information panel, Kurpfalzisches Museum, Heidelberg, 2018.\n\nThe Frankish Warrior\n\nOriginal clothing as known from the late Medieval period are missing from the Merovingian period. Finds in north German moorland, relief sculpture from the Roman Imperial period, Carolingian miniatures and contemporary descriptions, depict common Germanic clothing which was worn into the early Middle-Ages. In addition, grave deposits have included items worn with the deteriorated clothing. Strong regularities among Merovingian grave goods bear witness to the common appearance of the deceased.\n\nOver his pants the Frankish man wore a knee length, sleeved tunic. The tunic was tied at the waist with a metal shod leather belt. The belt pouch typically carried various bits and pieces; a knife, beard tweezers, fire steel and stone, seeds and herbs, amulets or religious tokens.\n\nImages: Photos of illustration of Frankish warrior and of replicated grave find, Kurpfalzisches Museum, Heidelberg, 2018, L. Dyck, 2018.\n\nRoman Limestone Quarry and Kiln, Heidelberg Rohrbach\n\nThe lime kiln produced lime (calcium oxide) by the burning of limestone (calcium carbonate) in temperatures above 900 degree Celsius. Usually mixed with water, lime was used as a basis for mortar in the construction of buildings. High quality lime had many other uses as well, including waterproofing walls, bleaching paper, in medicine and for soil enrichment. The diorama appears to show a Roman flare kiln; a well or pit like structure with a hearth at the base.\n\nSlave workers in Roman quarries were treated harshly. The rate of deaths increased as Rome’s elite became more wealthy and created ever greater demand. Having a skill could be a lifesaver, however, and valuable artisans such as stone masons received better treatment.\n\nRoman Legionary\n\nThe museum display shows a Roman legionary of the Imperial era, late 1st century CE. The figure appears to wear a Imperial Italic type helmet. These helmets were usually manufactured in Italy where armorers were more familiar in working with the easier bronze, rather than the more difficult iron. The basic design is of the newer of Roman “Coolus” helmet introduced during Augustus’ reign that replaced the older “Montefortino” helmet of Julius Caesar’s days. The Coolus helmets were based on the more natural skull design of the iron Gallic helmets and were further improved with Roman additions. The Coolus featured a larger neck guard than the Montefortino and additional protection against frontal blows. The crest was detachable and by this time was mostly worn during ceremonial functions. The figure wears a sleeveless mail hauberk with shoulder doubling, braced across the chest to prevent the shoulder straps to slip outwards as they would naturally do. The pilum held by the figure is a heavy javelin with a maximum range of about 100 feet (30 m).With the weight of the javelin further increased by the iron-topped wooden block, the small triangular head could penetrate shields and armor. The convex scutum shield features edges iron rimmed edges to protect against sword blows and wear and tear.\n\nRoman Auxiliary\n\nThe figure below features a Roman cavalry auxiliary soldier from around the second half of the first century CE. Protecting the body is a simple, sleeved mail hauberk. The sword is suspended by a baldric. The helmet is of iron and decorated with bronze linings. Its large flat projecting peak and the cheek guards with embossed ears are typical of the cavalry. The troopers main weapon is a thrusting spear, an additional javelin is leaning on his shield. The hexagonal shield is of the type seen on many 1st century cavalry tombstones.\n\nSkull of elderly Woman with elongated Skull: i Erin Blakemore, Pointy Skulls belong to Foreign Brides, DNA suggests, National Geographic.com.au, 13 March 2018"
