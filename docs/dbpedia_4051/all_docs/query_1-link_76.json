        "text": "The Early Iron Age Hallstatt C period in Northwest and Central Europe is marked by the emergence of monumental tumuli with lavish burials, some of which are known as chieftain's or princely graves. This new burial rite reflects one of the most noteworthy developments in Early Iron Age Europe: the rise of a new and elaborate way of elite representation north of the Alps. These sumptuous burials contain beautiful weaponry, bronze vessels and extravagantly decorated wagons and horse-gear. They reflect long-distance connections in material culture and elite (burial) practices across the breadth of Northwest and Central Europe. Research into this period, however, tends to be regionally focused and poorly accessible to scholars from other areas – language barriers in particular are a hindering factor. In an attempt to overcome this, Connecting Elites and Regions brings together scholars from several research traditions and nations who present regional overviews and discussions of elite burials and material culture from all over Northwest and Central Europe. In many cases these are the first overviews available in English and together they make regional research accessible to a wider audience. As such this volume contributes to and hopes to stimulate research on the Early Iron Age Hallstatt C period on a European scale.\n\nThere is a cluster of Early Iron Age (800–500 BC) elite burials in the Low Countries in which bronze vessels, weaponry, horse-gear and wagons were interred as grave goods. Mostly imports from Central Europe, these objects are found brought together in varying configurations in cremation burials generally known as chieftains’ graves or princely burials. In terms of grave goods they resemble the Fürstengräber of the Hallstatt Culture of Central Europe, with famous Dutch and Belgian examples being the Chieftain’s grave of Oss, the wagon-grave of Wijchen and the elite cemetery of Court-St-Etienne. Fragmenting the Chieftain presents the results of an in-depth and practice-based archaeological analysis of the Dutch and Belgian elite graves and the burial practice through which they were created. It was established that the elite burials are embedded in the local burial practices – as reflected by the use of the cremation rite, the bending and breaking of grave goods, and the pars pro toto deposition of human remains and objects, all in accordance with the dominant local urnfield burial practice. It appears that those individuals interred with wagons and related items warranted a more elaborate funerary rite, most likely because these ceremonial and cosmologically charged vehicles marked their owners out as exceptional individuals. Furthermore, in a few graves the configuration of the grave good set, the use of textiles to wrap grave goods and the dead and the reuse of burial mounds show the influence of individuals familiar with Hallstatt Culture burial customs. A comprehensive overview of the Dutch and Belgian graves can be found in the accompanying Fragmenting the Chieftain – Catalogue.

The majority of the Dutch and Belgian burials were found several decades to several centuries ago and context information tends to be limited. They also tend to be published in Dutch or French or otherwise difficult to access publications. This research went back to the original reports and studied the objects found in these graves in detail. This generated new and evidence-based insights and interpretations into these exceptional burials and allowed for the reconstruction of the individual burial rituals. Fragmenting the Chieftain – Catalogue presents the first comprehensive overview of the Dutch and Belgian elite graves (in English) and the objects they contain. The results of an in-depth and practice-based archaeological analysis of the Dutch and Belgian elite graves and the burial practice through which they were created can be found in Fragmenting the Chieftain. A practice-based study of Early Iron Age Hallstatt C elite burials in the Low Countries.\n\nThis study set out to investigate the changes in the burial ritual during the Middle Iron Age (500-250 BCE) in the Meuse-Demer-Scheldt area and the Dutch and bordering German Rhineland. The study aimed to identify these changes and to investigate how these were related to shifting ideas about identity and how they related to changing interregional connections. For the latter, an attempt was made to review whether this period should be considered to be a period of globalization. In order to investigate changing identities, both elite graves and the “other 99%” of regular graves have been analysed. A database was set-up including 71 cemeteries with a total of 651 graves located within the study area. The burial ritual changed in many respects, for example, monument building and urn burials became less frequent. Longbeds disappeared in favour of square and rectangular burial monuments and rectangular cult places. Grave goods, especially metal grave goods and animal bones, became a more frequent feature during this period. There also appeared to be many differences in the burial traditions between the different micro- regions. This seemed to indicate that the burial ritual was highly localized, especially the elite burial practices which appeared to be more localized than in the Early Iron Age. It was therefore concluded that it seemed plausible that the expression of identities changed from a collective urnfield identity in the Early Iron Age to a kin-based identity in the Middle Iron Age. In terms of social organization, the Middle Iron Age seemed to represent a more stratified society than the previous period. It appeared that wealth and status could be inherited through generations. The Early Iron Age connections with the Hallstatt area seemed to have disappeared during the Middle Iron Age. These were replaced by connections with the Moselle-Marne and Hunsrück-Eifel area. Unlike in the Early Iron Age, when the connections with the Hallstatt area were restricted to the upper 1% of the population, large parts of the population appeared to share in these connections. Especially Marne pottery, and for some micro-regions inhumation graves, were a frequent feature in the burial ritual. It was concluded that these connections did fit with the characteristics for a period of globalization. However, geographically the connections hardly reached beyond the Moselle-Marne and Hunsrück-Eifel areas. It was concluded that, in order to speak of globalization a wider geographical scope, preferably intercontinental, should be studied in order to truly assess such connections.\n\nThis paper discusses aspects of social structures of Early Iron Age societies and large-scale interaction in the early Hallstatt period between the Low Countries and the Hallstatt culture. In contrast to the later Hallstatt period and the Late Bronze Age, such contacts and societal differentiation are seldom discussed for the early Hallstatt period. Even though this period may have been organized on a more regional level in terms of culture groups and archaeologically traceable remnants of social interaction, underlying large-scale interactions are still visible as is evidence of social differentiation, especially in the burial practice. The burials of Oss in the Netherlands are the starting point to illustrate such interactions throughout Europe using the well-known Hallstatt imports in these burials as the first indicator of large-scale interactions. Furthermore, current research on burials both in the Low Countries and Central Europe allow more detailed insights into these burials and a comparison of the burial practices in these regions shows – among expected differences due to the regional embedment of burial rites – clear similarities in these, e.g. in the reuse of burial mounds, pars pro toto depositions and the wrapping of grave goods. These similarities indicate that it is more than just the objects that were traded throughout Europe and that there were shared underlying ideas of how these people were to be buried.\n\nThe appearance of large fortified Early Iron Age centers, traditionally known as Fürstensitze, represents one of the main developments of the first millennium BC north of the Alps. For a long time, their emergence was seen mainly as a result of increasing contacts with the Mediterranean world and in particular as a reaction to the foundation of the Greek colony of Massalia around 600 BC. However, rich burial evidence from the 8th and 7th centuries BC demonstrates that the increase in social hierarchisation and the development of powerful local elites predated by more than a century the arrival of the Greek colonists in southern France, implying that the social processes concerned were primarily of an indigenous nature. This paper will consider the evidence for Hallstatt C elite burials between Main and Danube, including outstanding examples such as the Gomadingen grave on the Swabian Alb and the sumptuous burial from Frankfurt-Stadtwald. The main conclusion is that we need to move away from Mediterraneo-centric perspectives and simplistic applications of core-periphery models, by acknowledging the importance of endogenous factors and the complexity of Early Iron Age networks."
