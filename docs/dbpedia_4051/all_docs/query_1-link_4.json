        "text": "Heinrich Karl Bukowski was born on August 16, 1920 in Andernach as the only child of Katarina Fet and Henry Heinrich Bukowski. Mother is a tailor from that small town, a gentle person, with a round face and big eyes. The father is an American from Pasadena, California, originally German and a sergeant in the US Army. After serving as an occupation soldier in Germany, he founds a construction company and goes bankrupt. The father has a rough appearance and character. He often beat him.\n\nIn 1923, the family moved to the USA in Baltimore. Eleven-year-old Charles, or Hank as he was called, speaks English with a German accent, and is bullied by children. 1924 - move to Los Angeles.\n\nCharles was exempted from classes in the 5th grade - because of acne that left a mark on his face for the rest of his life. Bukowski reads: Hemingway, Sinclair Lewis, Sherwood Anderson, John Dos Passos, DH Lawrence...\n\nLater, he enrolls in college, interrupts his studies and moves around America doing various jobs.\n\nWhile driving an ambulance, in 1942 in San Francisco, he got acquainted with classical music. And it stays with him for the rest of his life - like acne.\n\nBayrischer Rundfunk: \"Bukovski wrote with a light hand and dry humor about the horror of the banal, about bad sex, about easy women, horse racing, miserable jobs, and the joys of drunkenness.\"\n\nStrange that he was not interested in rock music, jazz or blues, but classical music, Beethoven, Tchaikovsky and Mahler, the works of white older men, whose pathos-laden music functions as a machine of glorification and sublimity.\n\nBukowski was older than the rebellious students of the 70s. He knew what was coming. In any case, those young fans of his admired his laconic sentences about banal reality.\n\nWhen he sat down at the typewriter scribbling, classical music could be heard in the background. His wonderfully simple, clear sentences speak of an existence without any hope, without any vision, as people like to say today, about a life that takes place at the very bottom of the materialistic world. Despite his misanthropy, his lyrics are always full of tenderness for others. The American existentialist Bukowski falls in line with Hamsun and Seline. And in the future it will have readers, that should be clear.\"\n\n\"Bukovski also worked in the post office, he sorted and delivered letters, and wrote his first novel \"The Man with a Leather Bag\", which is considered a classic of underground literature, although it is only about a drunken postman who, due to listlessness, fails in every area of ​​his life. But is aware that he does not have to fear any serious consequences. White Americans in the 70s did not know about existential fears,\" writes Velt.\n\nDeutschlandfunk culture: \"Over the years, Bukowski's prose and poetry became more concise, as if he didn't want to waste time.\" He threw out everything he considered ballast. He wrote to his friends more and more often about his poor health and said that he was not afraid of death. Two years before his death, he admitted that fame and fortune should not be despised, but he longed for the old days when he was still unknown. When asked about the secret of his success, he answered: It was just hard work, day after day, and a feeling of happiness at the same time.\n\nHe was often accused of being a trivial writer, of writing only about sex and drunkenness, and of being sexist. His image of a woman was quite traditional. at the same time, the XNUMXs movement worshiped him. Bukowski is above all, timeless because his themes are timeless and affect everyone, in every society.\n\nHe once said about himself:\n\nThey present me as braver and more talented than I was. It exaggerates ... the human race exaggerates everything, its heroes, its enemies, its importance.\n\nWhen asked about the meaning of life, he answered in an interview: Shit - next question.\"\n\nThe Berlin taz writes that a literary magazine devoted a special issue to him. It is about the magazine Drecksack, which in a free translation would be scum and whose subtitle reads - a readable magazine for literature. \"That would have appealed to Bukowski, who did not like literary magazines or literary evenings. The magazine is published by Florian Gunter, a good Bukowski connoisseur whose book \"Notes on a Dirty Old Man. \"Charle Bukowski from A to Z\" is coming out these days,\" writes taz.\n\nThe author of the article in Bild writes that he is still angry with Bukowski because he was only once in his and the author's hometown of Andernach, a small town on the Rhine with 25.000 inhabitants.\n\n\"I was still going to school, a few minutes' walk from the house where he was born, when Bukowski published his \"Fuck Machine\" in 1977. Absurd stories about 12 flying monkeys who don't really want to copulate, and a professor from Hitler's Germany who after invented the perfect Fuckmaschine for Americans.\n\nWhen he came to Germany for a literary evening in 1978, Helmut Schmidt was the chancellor, and Helmut Schön was the coach of the football team. An unprecedented winter was behind us, we thought we would drown in the snow. Bukowski came to Andernach and was astonished by the flood of the overflowing Rhine, which he later described in a book about that visit to Germany.\n\nThe beautiful villa where he spent his first eleven years was a brothel for a while - Bukowski would have liked that.\n\nAnd the plaque dedicated to him at that mansion is usually pretty shitty. If the pigeons didn't do it voluntarily, we would ask them to do it ourselves. Death, for him, was nothing more than \"the last joke in a series of bad jokes\".\n\nThe mayor of Andernach Achim Hiten (63, SPD), a Bukowski fan like me, wrote to the widow a few weeks ago: The federal state of Rhineland-Palatinate wants to establish a Bukowski prize, for young writers who are unconventional and sharp, like Bukowski. The widow did not answer.\"\n\nCharles Bukowski was married twice and has a daughter born in 1964. He suffered from leukemia. He died of pneumonia on March 9, 1994. \"Don't try\" is written on his tombstone.\n\nPrepared by: Dijana Roščić"
