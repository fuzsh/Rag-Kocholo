        "text": "German Americans (German: Deutschamerikaner) are citizens of the United States who are of German ancestry; they form the largest ethnic ancestry group in the United States, accounting for 17% of U.S. population.[1] The first significant numbers arrived in the 1680s in New York and Pennsylvania. Some eight million German immigrants have entered the United States since that point. Immigration continued in substantial numbers during the 19th century; the largest number of arrivals moved 1840–1900, when Germans formed the largest group of immigrants coming to the U.S., outnumbering the Irish and English.[2] Some arrived seeking religious or political freedom, others for economic opportunities greater than those in Europe, and others for the chance to start afresh in the New World. California and Pennsylvania have the largest populations of German origin, with more than six million German Americans residing in the two states alone.[3] More than 50 million people in the United States identify German as their ancestry; it is often mixed with other Northern European ethnicities.[4] This list also includes people of German Jewish descent.\n\nAmericans of German descent live in nearly every American county, from the East Coast, where the first German settlers arrived in the 17th century, to the West Coast and in all the states in between. German Americans and those Germans who settled in the U.S. have been influential in almost every field, from science, to architecture, to entertainment, and to commercial industry.\n\nDankmar Adler – architect[5][6]\n\nAdolf Cluss – architect, builder of numerous public buildings in Washington, D.C.[7]\n\nFerdinand Gottlieb – architect heading his own firm, Ferdinand Gottlieb & Associates, based in Dobbs Ferry, New York[8]\n\nWalter Gropius – pioneer in modern architecture, founder of Bauhaus[9]\n\nAlbert Kahn – industrial architect; known as the \"architect of Detroit\"[10]\n\nRichard Kiehnel – senior partner of Kiehnel, Elliot and Chalfant[11]\n\nHenry C.
