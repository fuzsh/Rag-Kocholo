        "text": "The German Hotel\n\nby Charles Bukowski\n\nthe German hotel was very strange and expensive and had\n\ndouble doors to the rooms, very thick doors, and it over—\n\nlooked the park and the vasser tern and in the mornings\n\nit was usually too late for breakfast and the maids\n\nwould be everywhere changing sheets and bringing in\n\ntowels, but you never saw any hotel guests, only the\n\nmaids and the desk man and the day desk man was all\n\nright because we were sober during the day but we had\n\ntrouble with the night man who was some sort of snob\n\nand not very good with getting the corkscrews and ice\n\nand wine glasses up to us and he was always phoning to\n\nsay the other guests objected to our noise.\n\nwhat other guests?\n\nI always told him that everything was very quiet,\n\nnothing was going on, that somebody must be crazy, so\n\nwill you please stop ringing?\n\nbut he kept ringing, he became almost like a\n\ncompanion to us through the night.\n\nbut the day man was very nice, he always had little\n\nmessages of importance that either meant money, or a\n\ngood friend coming to see us, or both.\n\nwe stayed at the hotel twice during our trip to\n\nEurope and each time we checked out the day clerk\n\nbowed ever so slightly, he was tall and well-dressed\n\nand pleasant and he said each time: “it was nice to\n\nhave you with us. please come here again if you return.”\n\n“thank you,” we said, “thank you.”\n\nit’s our favorite hotel and if I ever get rich I am\n\ngoing to buy it and fire the night clerk and there will\n\nbe enough ice cubes and corkscrews for everybody.\n\nNOTE: Charles Bukowski wrote “The German Hotel” in 1979, the year following his first trip to his birthplace, Andernach, Germany. The poem appeared in Wormwood Review, No. 81, 1981.\n\nPHOTO: Andernach, Germany.

Located on the banks of the Rhine River, it is one of the oldest towns in Germany, tracing its origins to a Roman settlement in 12 B.C.\n\nPHOTO: Birthplace of Charles Bukowski, Aktienstraße 12, 56626 Andernach, Germany.
