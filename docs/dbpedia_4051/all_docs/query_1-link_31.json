        "text": "The award-worthy actor, now enjoying an over five decade career, has a resume that includes everything from Shakespeare to Seinfeld -- from the villainous Senator on Ozark to the wise judge on Lincoln Lawyer.\n\nBorn on June 28, 1946, in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, the son of Clair, an architect and musician, and Marian (Holman) Davison, a secretary, Bruce's parents divorced when he was just three. He developed a burgeoning interest in acting while majoring in art at Penn State and after accompanying a friend to a college theater audition. Making his professional stage debut in 1966 as Jonathan in \"Oh Dad, Poor Dad, Mama's Hung You in the Closet and I'm Feelin' So Bad\" at the Pennsylvania Festival Theatre, he made it to Broadway within just a couple of years (1968) with the role of Troilus in \"Tiger at the Gates\" at the Vivian Beaumont Theatre. The year after that he was seen off-Broadway in \"A Home Away from Home\" and appeared at the Lincoln Center in the cast of \"King Lear.\"\n\nSuccess in the movies came immediately for the perennially youthful-looking actor after he and a trio of up-and-coming talents (Barbara Hershey [then known as Barbara Seagull], Richard Thomas and Catherine Burns) starred together in the poignant but disturbing coming-of-age film Petting (1969). From this he was awarded a starring role opposite Kim Darby in Blutige Erdbeeren (1970), an offbeat social commentary about 60s college radicalism, and in the cult horror flick Willard (1971) in which he bonded notoriously with a herd of rats.\n\nMoving further into the 70s decade, his film load did not increase significantly as expected and the ones he did appear in were no great shakes. With the exception of his co-starring role alongside Burt Lancaster in the well-made cavalry item Keine Gnade für Ulzana (1972) and the powerful low-budget Im Netz der Gewalt (1977) in which he played a child molester, Bruce's film roles were underwhelming, such as his elder Patrick Dennis in the Lucille Ball musical film version of Mame (1974), as well as Das zweite Kommando (1972), C.R.A.S.H. (1976), Grand Jury (1976) and Verstecktes Ziel (1978).\n\nAs such, Bruce wisely looked elsewhere for rewarding work and found it on the stage and on the smaller screen. Earning strong theatrical roles in \"The Skin of Our Teeth,\" \"The Little Foxes\" and \"A Life in the Theatre,\" he won the Los Angeles Drama Critics Award for his work in \"Streamers\" in 1977. On TV, he scored in mini-movie productions of Trauer muss Elektra tragen (1978), Deadman's Curve (1978) (portraying Dean Torrence of the surf-era pop duo Jan and Dean) and, most of all, Mein deutscher Soldat (1978) co-starring Kristy McNichol as a German prisoner of war in the American South who falls for a lonely Jewish-American girl. In 1972 Bruce married actress Jess Walton who appeared briefly as a college student in Blutige Erdbeeren (1970) and later became a daytime soap opera fixture. The marriage was quickly annulled the following year.\n\nThe 1980s was also dominated by strong theater performances. Bruce took over the role of the severely deformed John Merrick as \"The Elephant Man\" on Broadway; portrayed Clarence in \"Richard III\" at the New York Shakespeare Festival; was directed by Henry Fonda in \"The Caine Mutiny Court Martial\"; played a moving Tom Wingfield opposite Jessica Tandy's Amanda in \"The Glass Menagerie\"; received a second Los Angeles Drama Critics Award for his work in the AIDS play \"The Normal Heart\"; and finished off the decade gathering up fine reviews in the amusing A.R. Gurney period piece \"The Cocktail Hour\". While hardly lacking for work on film (Flucht auf heißen Reifen (1982), China Blue bei Tag und Nacht (1984), Spione wie wir (1985), and Zeit der Rache (1985)), few of them made use of his talents and range.\n\nIt was not until he was cast in the ground-breaking gay drama Freundschaft fürs Leben (1989) that his film career revitalized. Giving a quiet, finely nuanced, painfully tender performance as the middle-aged lover and caretaker of a life partner ravaged by AIDS, Bruce managed to stand out amid the strong ensemble cast and earn himself an Oscar nomination for \"Best Supporting Actor\". Although he lost out to the flashier antics of Joe Pesci in the mob drama GoodFellas - Drei Jahrzehnte in der Mafia (1990) that year, Bruce was not overlooked -- copping Golden Globe, Independent Spirit, New York Film Critics and National Society of Film Critics awards. Other gay-themed films also welcomed his presence, including Mississippi - Fluss der Hoffnung (1995) and It's My Party (1996). The actor eventually served as a spokesperson for a host of AIDS-related organizations, including Hollywood Supports, and has been active with foundations that assist abused children.\n\nBruce has been all over the screen since his success in Freundschaft fürs Leben (1989). Predominantly seen as mature, morally responsible dads and politicians, his genial good looks and likability have on occasion belied a weak or corrupt heart. Bruce married actress Lisa Pelikan in 1986 and they have one son, Ethan, born in 1996. (Die Farbe der Gerechtigkeit (1997)). Popular films have included Das Leben - Ein Sechserpack (1993) starring Will Smith, the family adventure film Gefährliche Wildnis (1995) and the box-office hit X-Men (2000) and its sequel in the role of Senator Kelly. More controversial art-house showcases include Dahmer (2002), as serial killer Jeffrey Dahmer's father, and Hate Crime (2005), as a bigoted, murderous pastor.\n\nInto the millennium, Bruce has played mature gents and several high-level officials in such films as Dead Girl (2006), Das Weihnachtswunder (2009), Camp Hell (2010), Black Beauty (2015), Displacement (2016), 9/11 (2017), Along Came the Devil (2018), Itsy Bitsy (2019)\n\nDivorced from second wife Lisa Pelikan, Bruce is happily married to Michele Correy and has a daughter with her, Sophia Lucy, born in 2006. They live in the Los Angeles area.\n\nSimon Rhee is a 7th Degree Black Belt in Tae Kwon Do and a 4th Degree Black Belt in Hap Ki Do. He is a World-Class Martial Artist known for his beautiful kicks and incredible forms, and is a many-time Grand Champion of the tournament circuit. Karate Illustrated noted that, \"Simon Rhee has the prettiest kicks, most flashiest and picturesque Martial Arts techniques in the nation\".

Simon Rhee is a teacher's teacher when it comes to Tae Kwon Do instruction and he has given many dynamic seminars to Martial Artists, Stunt people and, Black Belt Instructors worldwide.\n\nAn intense, versatile actor as adept at playing clean-cut FBI agents as he is psychotic motorcycle-gang leaders, who can go from portraying soulless, murderous vampires to burned-out, world-weary homicide detectives, Lance Henriksen has starred in a variety of films that have allowed him to stretch his talents just about as far as an actor could possibly hope. He played \"Awful Knoffel\" in the TNT original movie Evel Knievel (2004), directed by John Badham and executive produced by Mel Gibson. Henriksen portrayed \"Awful Knoffel\" in this project based on the life of the famed daredevil, played by George Eads. Henriksen starred for three seasons (1996-1999) on Millennium: Fürchte deinen Nächsten wie dich selbst (1996), Fox-TV's critically acclaimed series created by Chris Carter (Akte X: Die unheimlichen Fälle des FBI (1993)). His performance as Frank Black, a retired FBI agent who has the ability to get inside the minds of killers, landed him three consecutive Golden Globe nominations for \"Best Performance by a Lead Actor in a Drama Series\" and a People's Choice Award nomination for \"Favorite New TV Male Star\".\n\nHenriksen was born in New York City. His mother, Margueritte, was a waitress, dance instructor, and model. His father, James Marin Henriksen, who was from Tønsberg, Norway, was a boxer and merchant sailor. Henriksen studied at the Actors Studio and began his career off-Broadway in Eugene O'Neill's \"Three Plays of the Sea.\" One of his first film appearances was as an FBI agent in Sidney Lumet's Hundstage (1975), followed by parts in Lumet's Network (1976) and Prince of the City - Die Herren der Stadt (1981). He then appeared in Steven Spielberg's Die unheimliche Begegnung der 3. Art (1977) with Richard Dreyfuss and François Truffaut, Damien - Omen II (1978) and in Philip Kaufman's Der Stoff aus dem die Helden sind (1983), in which he played Mercury astronaut Capt. Wally Schirra.\n\nJames Cameron cast Henriksen in his first directorial effort, Fliegende Killer - Piranha II (1982), then used him again in Terminator (1984) and as the android Bishop in the sci-fi classic Aliens: Die Rückkehr (1986). Sam Raimi cast Henriksen as an outrageously garbed gunfighter in his quirky western Schneller als der Tod (1995). Henriksen has also appeared in what has developed into a cult classic: Kathryn Bigelow's Near Dark - Die Nacht hat ihren Preis (1987), in which he plays the head of a clan of murderous redneck vampires. He was nominated for a Golden Satellite Award for his portrayal of Abraham Lincoln in the TNT original film The Day Lincoln Was Shot (1998).\n\nIn addition to his abilities as an actor, Henriksen is an accomplished painter and potter. His talent as a ceramist has enabled him to create some of the most unusual ceramic artworks available on the art market today. He resides in Southern California with his wife Jane and their five-year-old daughter Sage.\n\nRobin Simone Givens was born on November 27, 1964 in New York City, to Ruth (Newby) and Reuben Givens. Her father left his family when Robin was a young girl, and she seldom saw him after that. Robin's mother raised her and her younger sister in Westchester, Connecticut. Her mother (once linked to Yankee outfielder Dave Winfield) always encouraged her children's creativity, and helped them develop an interest in the arts. When she was young, Robin began playing the violin but quickly decided it was not for her. She chose instead to channel her artistic energy through acting and, at the age of ten, she started acting classes at the American Academy of Dramatic Arts in New York City. In 1980, at fifteen, Robin enrolled as a freshman at Sarah Lawrence College to study pre-med. By her junior year, however, Robin's excitement about the idea of a career in acting intensified and she began taking her craft more seriously. Robin's first experience in Hollywood was on Die Bill Cosby Show (1984), the hottest show on television. As a result of the role, she and comedian Bill Cosby forged a great friendship which would prove instrumental in Robin's career. She also landed a guest appearance on Noch Fragen Arnold? (1978). Her career was just about to take off. Robin first made it big in Hollywood in 1986. She took a role in a television movie, Der Callgirl Club (1986), as \"April Baxter\". But, it was later that year that Robin became a recognizable actress in Hollywood. She was given a role on the television series Ganz große Klasse (1986) as \"Darlene Merriman\". The series was a comedy about a group of gifted high school students that were placed in an enrichment class. In 1988, Robin married boxing legend Mike Tyson. This union put her into the national spotlight, as Tyson was on the top of his career. He was one of the youngest boxers ever to receive the attention, acclaim and financial success that Tyson garnered. The marriage ended (on Valentine's Day), just a year later. Rumors hinted at abuse and infidelity. Robin gave marriage another chance in 1997, by marrying her tennis instructor Svetozar Marinkovic. The marriage proved a total failure, as the two were separated since the day they married, and Robin filed for divorce citing \"irreconcilable differences\". Aside from a successful model and acclaimed actress, Robin is a mother. In October 1999, she gave birth to a baby boy. The baby's father is tennis player Murphy Jensen, but the couple are no longer together. She has another child, and she is raising the two boys today. In 2000, Robin took a controversial career move as she took over for Mother Love on the successful television talk show, Forgive or Forget (1998). Her stint was brief, as just a few months later, the show stopped production. Many point to Mother Love's devoted audience, and the odd dismissal of her from the show she pioneered and created. Robin has tried to forge a friendship with Mother Love, but Love doesn't appear interested. Robin called in during a Howard Stern interview of Mother Love, where she said she was \"on her way to work\", which although innocent, proved to upset Mother Love.\n\nAs an established and extremely talented stunt double and actress, Zoe Bell has made a name for herself through her unparalleled dedication, skills, and focus.\n\nZoe Bell was born on Waiheke Island, New Zealand, to Tish, a nurse, and Andrew Bell, a doctor. She has a background in gymnastics and martial arts. She began working as a stunt woman when she doubled Lucy Lawless on the cult favorite TV series Xena: Die Kriegerprinzessin (1995). Bell also appeared as a double in the ABC thriller Alias: Die Agentin (2001) and on an episode of Cleopatra 2525 in 2000 as a double for Vicki Pratti. In the action packed-documentary 3, 2, 1 - Action (2004), Bell, along with legendary stunt-woman Jeannie Epper, give an insight into the career of women who take falls and punches for a living. Double Dare also gives a glimpse into the struggles of stunt-women to stay thin, employed, and sane in a male-dominated career.\n\nAfter the cancellation of Xena, Bell's next gig was working with Quentin Tarantino in Kill Bill - Vol. 1 (2003) and Kill Bill: Vol. 2 (2004), playing the stunt double for Uma Thurman's role, The Bride. Bell was nominated for her work in Kill Bill, Vol. 1 in the categories of Best Stunt by a Stunt Woman and Best Fight for the Taurus World Stunt Awards, both of which she would win the following year for Kill Bill: Vol. 2. Bell also showed off her stunt-woman skills as a double for Sharon Stone in Halle Barry's Catwoman (2004).\n\nBell was injured in the final days of filming, requiring surgery, but she has since recovered and returned to work. Bell appeared along with legendary stunt woman Jeannie Epper in Amanda Micheli's acclaimed documentary 3, 2, 1 - Action (2004), which offers a glimpse at the lives and careers of both women, as well as the friendship they share.\n\nBell debuted her acting career, with her already famous stunt skills, in the double feature Grindhouse (2007) written by Quentin Tarantino and Robert Rodriguez. She was hand-picked, by Tarentino himself, to star in his segment of the double feature, Death Proof - Todsicher (2007), about four women working in the film industry that are stalked by a murderer in his Death Proof car.\n\nBell, a native of New Zealand, resides in Los Angeles but hopes to someday own a home in New Zealand.\n\nRichard Treat Williams was born in Stamford, Connecticut, to Marian (Andrew), who dealt in antiques, and Richard Norman Williams, a corporate executive. At the age of three, his family moved to Rowayton, Connecticut.\n\nEducated at prep-school, he first made a serious commitment to his craft during his days at Pennsylvania's Franklin and Marshall College. Working summers with the nearby Fulton Repertory Theatre at Lancaster in the heart of Amish country, Williams performed the classics as well as contemporary dramas and musicals.\n\nAfter graduating, Williams--whose first name, incidentally, is a family surname on his mother's side--headed for Manhattan where he understudied the Danny Zuko role in \"Grease.\" After working in the The Andrews Sisters musical \"Over Here,\" he made his film debut as a cop in Eiskalt (1975), then returned to \"Grease,\" this time in the starring role. While he took leaves for two small film roles, in Der Mörder lauert in der Sauna (1976) and Der Adler ist gelandet (1976), it was his stage work in \"Grease\" that led to his cinematic breakthrough in Hair (1979). Spotted by director Milos Forman, Williams was asked to read for the role of Berger, the hippie. It took 13 auditions to land the part, but the film's release catapulted Williams into stardom.\n\nWilliams then portrayed a GI on the make in Steven Spielberg's 1941 - Wo bitte geht's nach Hollywood (1979) and starred in the romantic comedy Warum sollte ich lügen? (1980) before tackling the role of Danny Ciello, the disillusioned New York City cop who blew the whistle on his corrupt colleagues in Sidney Lumet's Prince of the City - Die Herren der Stadt (1981). He followed that with Die Jagd (1981), in which he played the legendary plane hijacker who successfully eluded capture (by Robert Duvall); Die Grenzwölfe (1984), in which he and Kris Kristofferson starred as a pair of maverick border patrolmen who come upon a large cache of stolen money; Sergio Leone's Es war einmal in Amerika (1984), in which he played a Jimmy Hoffa-like labor organizer; and Bedrohliches Geflüster (1985), a screen adaptation of Joyce Carol Oates' short story, \"Where Are You Going?\"\n\nTelevision viewers have seen Williams in a prestigious pair of dramas, Jack Dempsey - Ein Mann wird zur Legende (1983), a three-hour story of the hard-living heavyweight champ, and John Erman's adaptation of Tennessee Williams' classic \"A Streetcar Named Desire,\" which pitted Williams' Stanley Kowalski against Ann-Margret's Blanche Dubois. Williams has also returned to Broadway sporadically -- first to appear in \"Once in a Lifetime\" while filming \"Hair,\" and in 1981 to play the role of the pirate king in \"The Pirates of Penzance.\"\n\nWilliams died in a motorcycle June 12, 2023, in Vermont. The driver who hit Williams knew him, and pled guilty to negligent driving resulting in death.\n\nIan Ziering (pronounced 'EYE-an, Zare-ring') was born on March 30, 1964, and was raised in West Orange, New Jersey. By the mid-1970s, young Ian was landing spots in national commercials at the age of 12, which led to roles in various soap operas and stage plays, most notably Springfield Story (1952), the Broadway production of I Remember Mama and, in a national touring production of Peter Pan. In 1981 he made his feature film debut in Endless Love (1981) (as Brooke Shields's little brother) - a film that also marked the big-screen debuts of Tom Cruise and James Spader.\n\nHowever, in 1990, Ziering landed the role that would change his life - 'Steve Sanders' on the teen drama, Beverly Hills, 90210 (1990). The show brought instant, worldwide fame to the cast. Ian was suddenly an international heartthrob and played the role for the show's entire ten-year run. During his years on Beverly Hills, 90210 (1990) he was also featured in various films and television shows, including Russell Crowe's No Way Back (1995), Hallo Holly (2002) and Melrose Place (1992), to name a few.\n\nSince Beverly Hills, 90210 (1990), Ziering has appeared on numerous television shows including CSI: New York (2004), J.A.G. - Im Auftrag der Ehre (1995) and Fran Drescher's Happily Divorced (2011). In addition, he has continued to be one of the most in-demand actors for various animated films and television shows including Spider-Man (2003), Mighty Ducks (1996), Batman of the Future (1999) and Biker Mice from Mars (1993). In 2005, in a real change of pace from his normal acting roles, Ziering also appeared in the Tony Scott feature film thriller, Domino (2005), with Keira Knightley. Other film credits include National Lampoon's: 301 - Scheiß auf ein Empire (2011), Der Chaos-Dad (2012) with Adam Sandler, An American Girl: McKenna Shoots for the Stars (2012) with Nia Vardalos, Snake & Mongoose (2013), and, Christmas in Palm Springs (2014).\n\nIn 2007, Ziering showed the world that he was a true triple threat when he signed on to the fourth season of the hit ABC series, Dancing with the Stars (2005). A fan and judge favorite with his partner, two-time Mirror Ball Champion Cheryl Burke, the pair eventually danced their way into the show's semifinals. In addition to his ongoing acting roles and voice over work, Ian is a much sought-after television host and, was most recently seen hosting HGTV's A-List Pets.\n\n2013 proved to be a pivotal year for Ziering both professionally and personally. At the age of 49, Ian became a Las Vegas headliner when he starred as the celebrity guest host of the award-winning production of Chippendales at the Rio All-Suite Hotel and Casino. Taking on this new role, the actor hit the gym and dropped 30 pounds, transforming himself into a fit and muscled man, thrilling the sold-out audiences. His Chippendales engagement brought him a new wave of fans and international acclaim, thrusting him once again into the limelight. The engagement was such a huge success, establishing Ian as a major Las Vegas box-office draw, he was asked to return to the show in Summer 2014 for another sold-out run at the Rio with the world-famous brand.\n\nHowever, it was during his final week with the Chippendales in 2013 that Ian's small-budget film Sharknado - Genug gesagt! (2013) aired on the SyFy Channel and instantly became a social media and worldwide phenomenon. Garnering more than 5,000 Tweets per minute during its initial broadcast - more than any other television show to date - Sharknado - Genug gesagt! (2013) became an instant science fiction, cult classic and, even received a theatrical release in movie theatres around the world due to its popularity with fans.\n\nThe franchise exploded so much that in July 2014 Ian reprised his role as Fin Shepard in SyFy's Sharknado 2 (2014), and the film went on to devour the world and become an even bigger pop culture phenomenon than the first. The record-setting sequel had nearly 4 million viewers in its first broadcast and went on to claim the title as the \"Most social movie on TV ever\" by garnering one billion (that is NOT a typo) Twitter impressions. At one point, Sharknado 2 (2014) held all top 10 trending topics in the United States with more mentions on Twitter than #MileyCyrus on the day of the 2013 MTV Video Music Awards (2013), and #kimye on Kim Kardashian and Ye's wedding day. Sharknado 3: Oh Hell No! (2015) stormed the world in July 2015 and chomped its way to over 2 billion Twitter impressions - doubling those of Sharknado 2 (2014). Generating more Twitter activity than every episode of the final season of Mad Men (2007), every episode of last Season's Der Bachelor (2002) and Hillary Clinton's Presidential announcement, Sharknado 3: Oh Hell No! (2015) trended #1 in the United States and #2 worldwide. The latest film in the hit franchise, Sharknado 4: The 4th Awakens (2016), debuted on July 31, 2016 on SyFy.\n\nA true philanthropist, Ian used his brains, brawn (and his heart) when he competed on NBC's 7th Season of the hit series, The Celebrity Edition of The Apprentice (2004). Along with his other contestants, Ian endured challenging tasks that tested his ability to work with his colleagues while ultimately raising over $320,000 for the EB Medical Research Foundation (www.ebkids.org). Ian is proud to be the fourth highest celebrity fundraiser in the history of The Celebrity Edition of The Apprentice (2004). Inspired by his entrepreneurial tasks during The Celebrity Edition of The Apprentice (2004), Ian has created a new clothing line, Chainsaw Brands (ChainsawBrands.com), featuring classic American style athletic leisure and apparel. In keeping with his philanthropic nature, a portion of all proceeds from the sale of his signature line will benefit those less fortunate. In addition, in February 2016, Ian launched CelebrityHideaways.com, a luxury destination based website for the discerning traveler looking for unique experiences typically frequented by the rich and famous. His extensive travel over the last 30 years lends itself to revealing the less beaten path for site visitors to browse, get information, and book their perfect vacation.\n\nAnd, it's not just his professional career that is soaring. Ian's personal life has seen some wonderful changes as well over the last few years. He and his wife, nurse Erin Ziering, welcomed their second daughter, Penna Mae in 2013. Their first daughter, Mia Loren, was born on the same day, two years earlier. The quintessential father and family man, Ian was named DaddyScrubs \"Daddy of the Year 2013,\" an award which recognizes fathers who are extremely proactive in raising their children. In June 2016, Ian and his wife launched the family blog, AtHomeWithTheZierings.com, a creative resource for other families. Ian currently resides in Los Angeles with his wife and daughters.
