Charles Bukowski was a German-American poet, novelist and short story writer. He was born in Andernach, Germany in 1920 and immigrated to the United States as a child. Bukowski wrote extensively about the ordinary lives of poor Americans, relationships and the drudgery of work. He published thousands of poems and hundreds of short stories over several decades in small literary magazines. Bukowski received little attention from academic critics during his lifetime but enjoyed popularity in Europe and was called the \"laureate of American lowlife.\" He lived most of his life in Los Angeles where he was influenced by the city's culture and wrote until his death in 1994.",
