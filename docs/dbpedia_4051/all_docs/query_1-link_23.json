        "text": "Joan Collins is an English actress from Paddington, London. She is most famous for playing the role of vengeful schemer Alexis Carrington Colby in the soap opera \"Dynasty\" (1981-1989). In 1997, She was appointed an Officer of the Order of the British Empire (OBE) for services to drama. In 2015, She was promoted to the rank of Dame Commander of the Order of the British Empire (DBE) for services to charity.\n\nShe was the daughter of talent agent Joseph William Collins (1902-1988) and his wife, dance teacher Elsa Bessant, (1906-1962). Joseph was born in South Africa, and of Jewish descent. As a talent agent, his most famous clients were Shirley Bassey, the Beatles, and Tom Jones. Elsa was born in the United Kingdom to an Anglican family.\n\nCollins was educated at Francis Holland School in London, an independent day school for girls. She made her theatrical debut c. 1942, as a child actress. She had a role in a performance of the play \"A Doll's House\" (1879) by Henrik Ibsen (1828-1906). In 1949, She started training as an actress at the Royal Academy of Dramatic Art (RADA) in London. In 1950, she signed a contract with a British film studio, the Rank Organisation of businessman Joseph Arthur Rank, 1st Baron Rank (1888-1972).\n\nCollins made her film debut in the short film \"Facts and Fancies\" (1951), and her feature film debut in \"Lady Godiva Rides Again\" (1951), where she played an unnamed Beauty Queen Contestant. She had supporting roles as the Greek maid Marina in \"The Woman's Angle\" (1952) and gangster's moll Lil Carter in \"Judgment Deferred\" (1952).\n\nCollins had her big break when cast as juvenile delinquent Norma Hart in prison drama \"I Believe in You\" (1952). She was hailed as Britain's new \"bad girl\" and started being offered high-profile roles in British films. The next stage in her career started when cast as Princess Nellifer of Egypt in the historical epic \"Land of the Pharaohs\" (1955), an international production . While the film was not successful at the box office, it became a cult classic and Nellifer was one of her most recognizable roles. Studio executive Darryl Francis Zanuck (1902-1979) was sufficiently impressed to offer her a 7-year-long contract with American studio 20th Century Fox. She took the offer.\n\nCollins' first American film was the historical drama \"The Virgin Queen\" (1955), where she shared the top-billing with established stars Bette Davis and Richard Todd. She then played the leading role of actress Evelyn Nesbit (1884/1885-1967) in the biographical film \"The Girl in the Red Velvet Swing\" (1955). The role was intended for established actress Marilyn Monroe, but she replaced Monroe based on a studio decision.\n\nCollins was placed on loan to studio Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer for her next role, that of gold digger Crystal in \"The Opposite Sex\" (1956). She received the top billing in the refugee-themed film \"Sea Wife\" (1956), and enjoyed box-office success with the interracial-love themed drama \"Island in the Sun\" (1957). In the drama film \"The Wayward Bus\" (1957), she received top-billing over her co-star Jayne Mansfield. Her next films included the spy thriller \"Stopover Tokyo\" (1957), the Western \"The Bravados\" (1958), the comedy \"Rally Round the Flag, Boys\" (1959), the caper film \"Seven Thieves\" (1960), and the biblical epic Esther and the King (1960).\n\nBy 1960, Collins was one of 20th Century Fox's biggest stars, but she demanded a release from her studio contract. She had campaigned for the title role in the upcoming production of \"Cleopatra\", but the studio chose to cast Elizabeth Taylor in the role. Collins felt slighted. As a freelance actress for most of the 1960s, she had few film roles. Among her most notable roles was playing the leading lady in \"The Road to Hong Kong\" (1962), the last film in the long-running \"Road to ...\" series. The male leads for the entire series were Bing Crosby and Bob Hope, but their usual leading lady Dorothy Lamour was considered too old for the role. Collins replaced Lamour.\n\nCollins started appearing frequently on television guest star roles. Among her most notable television roles was the villainous Siren in \"Batman\", and pacifist spokeswoman Edith Keeler in \"Star Trek: The Original Series\". \"Road to ...\" played in only one episode of Star Trek, the time-travel episode \"The City on the Edge of Forever\" (1967). However the episode is regarded among the best episodes in the entire Star Trek franchise, with Collins considered one of the most memorable guest stars in the original series.\n\nIn 1970, Collins returned to her native United Kingdom. She started appearing frequently in British thriller and horror films of the decade. Among her films was revenge-themed drama \"Revenge\" (1971),science fiction film \"Quest for Love\" (1972), horror anthology \"Tales from the Crypt\" (1972), psychological horror \"Fear in the Night\" (1972), thriller \"Dark Places\", horror anthology \"Tales That Witness Madness\" (1973), and horror film \"I Don't Want to Be Born\" (1975).\n\nCollins appeared in a few comedies in-between horror films, but none was particularly successful. She returned to the United States in order to play a role in the giant monster film \"Empire of the Ants\" (1977). She then returned to mostly appearing in thriller roles. She was catapulted back to stardom with the lead role of nymphomaniac Fontaine Khaled in the erotic drama \"The Stud\" (1978), an adaptation of a novel written by her younger sister Jackie Collins. The film was a surprise box office hit, earning 20 million dollars at the worldwide box office. \"Road to ...\" returned to the role of Fontaine in the sequel film ''The Bitch'' (1979), which was also a hit.\n\nCollins found herself in high demand in both stage and film. But she gained more notoriety with the television role of Alexis Carington in \"Dynasty\". She started appearing in the role in the second season of the soap opera. Her performance is credited with the subsequent rise of the show's Nielsen's ratings. She became a household name, and received a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame in 1983.\n\nBy 1985, \"Dynasty\" was the number-one show in the United States, beating out rival soap opera \"Dallas\". Collins was nominated six times for a Golden Globe Award for her role, winning once in 1983. She was also once nominated for an Emmy as Best Actress in a Drama Series. Collins was viewed as a sex symbol at the time, and in 1983 appeared in a 12-page photo layout for Playboy magazine. She was 50-years-old, unusually old for a Playboy model.\n\nCollins appeared in a total of 195 episodes of \"Dynasty\". The series was canceled with the last episode of its 9th season, due to falling ratings. New ABC entertainment president Bob Iger (1951-) is credited with ending the series as soon as possible. The show had a cliffhanger ending, and several of its subplots were not resolved. Collins returned to the role of Alexis in the sequel mini-series \"Dynasty: The Reunion\" (1991). The miniseries only lasted for 2 episodes, but resolved several subplots and was a ratings hit.\n\nThroughout the 1990s., Collins returned to guest star roles in television. She appeared in (among others) \"Roseanne\", \"Egoli: Place of Gold\", and \"The Nanny\", She had the recurring role of Christina Hobson in the short-lived soap opera \"Pacific Palisades\" (1997). She appeared in 7 of its 13 episodes. Her next notable soap opera role was that of so-called \"rich bitch\" Alexandra Spaulding in 2002 episodes of the long-running series \"Guiding Light\". Collins was the third actress to play this role. following Beverlee McKinsey and Marj Dusay.\n\nIn film, Collins played Pearl Slaghoople, Wilma Flintstone's mother, in \"The Flintstones in Viva Rock Vegas\" (2000). It was the second live-action film based on the popular animated series \"The Flintstones\". In 2006, she toured the United Kingdom with \"An Evening with Joan Collins\", an one-woman show where she narrated the highs and lows of her career and life. She later toured the word with both this show and its sequel \"Joan Collins Unscripted\".\n\nCollins had a notable guest star-role as Ruth Van Rydock in the television film \"Agatha Christie's Marple: They Do It with Mirrors\" (2009). The film was an adaptation of the 1952 novel by Agatha Christie, where Ruth is an old school friend of Jane Marple, who assigned Jane to investigate a home for juvenile delinquents.\n\nCollins played herself in three episodes of the sitcom \"Happily Divorced\" (2011-2013). She had the recurring role of Crystal Hennessy-Vass in the sitcom \"Benidorm\" (2007-2018). She had another recurring role as Alexandra, Grand Duchess of Oxford in the soap opera \"The Royals\" (2015-2018).\n\nCollins had two different roles in the horror anthology series \"American Horror Story\". She played wealthy grandmother Evie Gallant, and witch Bubbles McGee. She appeared in a total of four episodes in 2018.\n\nBy 2024, Collins was 90-years-old. She has never retired from acting, and she continues to appear in new roles.\n\nAs one of Hollywood's leading men, Bruce Boxleitner has starred in a major motion picture franchise, numerous feature films, and several popular television series, produced a major network film and TV series, performed on Broadway, and authored two science fiction novels.\n\nBoxleitner received his formal acting training on stage.

Boxleitner resides in Los Angeles with his wife, publicist Verena King, and has three sons: Sam, Lee and Michael.\n\nIn 1976, if you had told fourteen-year-old Franciscan seminary student Thomas Cruise Mapother IV that one day in the not too distant future he would be Tom Cruise, one of the top 100 movie stars of all time, he would have probably grinned and told you that his ambition was to join the priesthood. Nonetheless, this sensitive, deeply religious youngster who was born in 1962 in Syracuse, New York, was destined to become one of the highest paid and most sought after actors in screen history.\n\nTom is the only son (among four children) of nomadic parents, Mary Lee (Pfeiffer), a special education teacher, and Thomas Cruise Mapother III, an electrical engineer. His parents were both from Louisville, Kentucky, and he has German, Irish, and English ancestry. Young Tom spent his boyhood always on the move, and by the time he was 14 he had attended 15 different schools in the U.S. and Canada. He finally settled in Glen Ridge, New Jersey with his mother and her new husband. While in high school, Tom wanted to become a priest but pretty soon he developed an interest in acting and abandoned his plans of becoming a priest, dropped out of school, and at age 18 headed for New York and a possible acting career. The next 15 years of his life are the stuff of legends. He made his film debut with a small part in Endless Love (1981) and from the outset exhibited an undeniable box office appeal to both male and female audiences.\n\nWith handsome movie star looks and a charismatic smile, within 5 years Tom Cruise was starring in some of the top-grossing films of the 1980s including Top Gun (1986); Die Farbe des Geldes (1986), Rain Man (1988) and Geboren am 4. Juli (1989). By the 1990s he was one of the highest-paid actors in the world earning an average 15 million dollars a picture in such blockbuster hits as Interview mit einem Vampir (1994), Mission: Impossible (1996) and Jerry Maguire: Spiel des Lebens (1996), for which he received an Academy Award Nomination for best actor. Tom Cruise's biggest franchise, Mission Impossible, has also earned a total of 3 billion dollars worldwide. Tom Cruise has also shown lots of interest in producing, with his biggest producer credits being the Mission Impossible franchise.\n\nIn 1990 he renounced his devout Catholic beliefs and embraced The Church of Scientology claiming that Scientology teachings had cured him of the dyslexia that had plagued him all of his life. A kind and thoughtful man well known for his compassion and generosity, Tom Cruise is one of the best liked members of the movie community. He was married to actress Nicole Kidman until 2001. Thomas Cruise Mapother IV has indeed come a long way from the lonely wanderings of his youth to become one of the biggest movie stars ever.\n\nMichelle Branch was born on July 2, 1983 in Sedona, Arizona as Michelle Jaquet DeSevren Branch. She was born 7 weeks early, weighing only 3 lbs. 11 oz. When she was 3, she recorded herself singing Beatles covers on her parents karaoke machine & sent them off to her grandmother. She took up singing lessons at 8 but had to stop when she moved at 11. Afterwards, she took singing lessons w/ Gina Bettum. A year after picking up the guitar, she began lessons w/ Gina's husband but soon stopped after she found herself constantly being technical instead of artistic. At 15, she left school & was home-schooled tutored by her mom w/ a clear warning that if her grades dropped, she had return to school.\n\nHer 1st break into the music industry happened when she was at home looking after her younger sister. A family friend called her, telling her that a music manager named Jeff Rabhan was taking a time share tour at her company & to get down to her office w/ a demo tape. Since she was unable to leave her sister alone, lacked a driver's license & her parents weren't at home, she stole her neighbor's golf cart & made her way down to the resort. When she got there, he wasn't interested, but after forcing her tape on him, he listened to it on his way home in the car. A few months later, she unexpectedly received a phone call from him, asking to sign her.\n\nAfterwards, she went into the studio to record an indie album titled Broken Bracelet, planning to give it away at local shows. In summer 2000, she received another phone call-this time from Hanson's reps, asking her to play in some of its upcoming shows. She happily accepted, packed her bags & flew to California. There, she was spotted by a rep at Maverick Records who offered a record deal. In December 2000, she eventually signed w/ the label.\n\nIn summer 2001, her 1st hit turned out to be Everywhere. It shot to #12 on the Billboard Hot 100, establishing her as an up-&-comer. Several artists wanted to work w/ her such as Lifehouse, Jude, The Calling, Sheryl Crow & The Chicks. In January 2002, All You Wanted debuted at #6, eventually reaching #1 on the TRL top 10. That summer, Carlos Santana asked to collaborate w/ her for the Game Of Love, a song off his comeback album Shaman. It cracked the top 5, gaining her worldwide recognition.\n\nIn April 2003, she finished recording the album Hotel Paper. The 1st single was Are You Happy Now?. Since then, she has gone on to perform at the Super Bowl & Latin VMAs. She also became the 1st person to perform on top of the Madison Square Garden marquee.\n\nBon Jovi is an American rock band formed in 1983 in Sayreville, New Jersey. It consists of singer Jon Bon Jovi, keyboardist David Bryan, drummer Tico Torres, guitarist Phil X, and bassist Hugh McDonald. Original bassist Alec John Such quit the band in 1994, and longtime guitarist and co-songwriter Richie Sambora left in 2013. The band have been credited with \" the gap between heavy metal and pop with style and ease\".\n\nIn 1984 and 1985, Bon Jovi released their first two albums and their debut single \"Runaway\" managed to crack the Top 40. In 1986, the band achieved widespread success and global recognition with their third album, Slippery When Wet, which sold over 20 million copies and included three Top 10 singles, two of which reached No. 1 (\"You Give Love a Bad Name\" and \"Livin' on a Prayer\") Their fourth album, New Jersey (1988), was also very successful, selling over 10 million copies and featuring five Top 10 singles (a record for a glam metal album), two of which reached No. 1 (\"Bad Medicine\" and \"I'll Be There for You\"). After the band toured and recorded extensively during the late 1980s, culminating in the 1988-1990 New Jersey Tour, Jon Bon Jovi and Richie Sambora released successful solo albums in 1990 and 1991, respectively.\n\nIn 1992, the band returned with the double-platinum Keep the Faith. This was followed by their biggest-selling and longest-charting single \"Always\" (1994) and the album These Days (1995), which proved to be a bigger success in Europe than in the United States, producing four Top Ten singles in the United Kingdom. Following a second hiatus, their 2000 album Crush, particularly the lead single, \"It's My Life\", successfully introduced the band to a younger audience, and the band considered this their comeback album. The band followed up with Bounce in 2002. The platinum albums Have a Nice Day (2005) and Lost Highway (2007) saw the band incorporate elements of country music into some of the songs, including the 2006 single \"Who Says You Can't Go Home\", which won the band a Grammy Award and became the first single by a rock band to reach No. 1 on the country charts. The Circle (2009) marked a return to the band's rock sound. The band also enjoyed great success touring, with both the 2005-2006 Have a Nice Day Tour and 2007-2008 Lost Highway Tour ranking among the Top 20 highest-grossing concert tours of the 2000s. After recording and releasing Because We Can in 2013, lead guitarist Richie Sambora left the band just before an April concert during the supporting tour to spend more time with his family. The band released their first studio album without Sambora, Burning Bridges, in 2015 and the follow-up album This House Is Not For Sale in 2016, the tour for which encompassed 2017-2019. Their most recent album 2020 (2020) was re-worked to include songs inspired by the COVID-19 pandemic and George Floyd protests; its supporting tour was delayed to 2022.\n\nBon Jovi has released 16 studio albums, five compilations and three live albums. They have sold more than 130 million records worldwide, making them one of the best-selling American rock bands, and performed more than 2,700 concerts in over 50 countries for more than 34 million fans. Bon Jovi was inducted into the UK Music Hall of Fame in 2006, and into the US Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 2018. The band received the Award of Merit at the American Music Awards in 2004, and Jon Bon Jovi and Richie Sambora were inducted into Songwriters Hall of Fame in 2009.\n\nEmilio Estevez was born on May 12, 1962, in New York City. He is the eldest son of actor Martin Sheen, who at the time was just breaking into the business. His mother, Janet Sheen (née Templeton), was a former New York art student who had met Emilio's father right after he had moved to Manhattan. Martin and Janet had three other children, Charlie Sheen, Renée Estevez, and Ramon Estevez, all of whom became actors. His father is of half Spanish and half Irish descent, and his mother, whose family is from Kentucky, has English and Scottish ancestry.\n\nHe lived on Manhattan's Upper West Side until his family relocated to Malibu in 1968. Before graduating from Santa Monica High School in 1980, Estevez had already had a small role as a messenger boy in Apocalypse Now (1979), that was ultimately cut from the film.\n\nThough his father had opted to use the stage name \"Sheen\" over his more ethnic birth name \"Estevez,\" Emilio chose to retain the family name, hoping to avoid riding his father's coattails. He also thought the double \"E\" set of initials was \"pretty.\"\n\nHe appeared in a few TV movies, the first of which was 17 Going on Nowhere (1980), before making his big-screen debut opposite Matt Dillon in 1982's Tex (1982). A part in Outsider: Rebellen ohne Grund (1983) followed, and Estevez made his first big splash as the punk rocker Otto in the cult classic Repo Man (1984).\n\nOriginally cast as Bender (The Criminal) in the seminal John Hughes flick Der Frühstücksclub (1985), Estevez took the part of Andrew (The Athlete) instead after Hughes could find no one else to fill the role. Another ensemble film, St. Elmo's Fire: Die Leidenschaft brennt tief (1985) came next. Then Estevez made his screen-writing debut with Jungs außer Kontrolle (1985), a film in which he also starred.\n\nHe then starred in the Stephen King thriller and cult hit Rhea M. - Es begann ohne Warnung (1986), . The ambitious young actor added directing to his palette with Wisdom - Dynamit und kühles Blut (1986) in 1986. Estevez went on to write, direct and star in the film Men at Work , Men at Work (1990) alongside his brother Charlie Sheen in 1989 . Originally written as an environmental comedy that follows two slacker garbage men who find a dead politician in a trash barrel,''Men at Work'' went on to be a moderate success and enjoys a \"cult\" status.\n\nEstevez jumped back into making studio films with hits like Die Nacht hat viele Augen (1987) and Young Guns - Sie fürchten weder Tod noch Teufel (1988), as well as their subsequent sequels.\n\nIn 1992, Emilio took on one of his most iconic and famous roles as Coach Gordon Bombay in Mighty Ducks - Das Superteam (1992). The enormously popular Disney film spawned two sequels and an NHL hockey team of the same name, but Estevez was interested in making more dramatic films.\n\nIn 1995, he agreed to make a brief appearance in Mighty Ducks 3 - Jetzt mischen sie die Highschool auf (1996) in exchange for Disney helping him finance and distribute another effort as actor-director, Heimatfront (1996). Though smiled on by critics, Heimatfront (1996) received a very limited distribution by Disney and thus went largely unseen. The War at Home, filmed in Austin, Texas, is an exploration of the effects of PTSD on a Vietnam veteran who has returned to his Texas family's home in 1972. The film co-stars Oscar winner, Kathy Bates, Estevez ' s father Martin Sheen and Kimberly Williams . The film premiered at the Toronto Film Festival in 1996 as an Official Selection. Estevez continued to work in films, both behind and in front of the camera, including a fourth effort as director and star, Rated X (2000), which co-starred brother Charlie Sheen and was a selection at the Sundance Film Festival in 2000.\n\nIn 2006, Emilio made the motion picture Bobby. Bobby (2006), a \"day in the life\" film. Robert F. Kennedy Estevez wrote, directed, and acted in the picture, which, follows 22 characters in the Ambassador Hotel on June 4th, 1968 on the day Senator Robert F. Kennedy was assassinated following his win in the California primary. The film remains one of the starriest ensemble cast ever assembled with Anthony Hopkins, Sharon Stone, William H. Macy, Demi Moore, Ashton Kutcher, Laurence Fishburne, Harry Belafonte, Lindsay Lohan, Helen Hunt, Martin Sheen and many others in the cast. Distributed by The Weinstein Company, \"Bobby\" went on to be nominated for two Golden Globes, Best Original Song and Best Picture (Drama), as well as a Screen Actors Guild Best Ensemble nomination in 2006. He won a Hollywood Film Best Ensemble Award and received a 7-minute standing ovation at the Venice Film Festival following his nomination for the prestigious Golden Lion for directing the film . The film had its North American premiere at the Toronto Film Festival where it was an Official Selection.\n\nIn 2009 Estevez filmed a new project which he wrote, produced and directed called, The Way, in Spain starring his father, Martin Sheen, in a story about a man who decides to make the Camino de Santiago after the death of his son in the French Pyrénées. It was released in the United States on October 7, 2011, following the premiere at the Toronto Film Festival in 2010.\n\nIn 2019, Estevez released another feature film, The Public, starring Alec Baldwin, Christian Slater, Jena Malone, Jeffrey Wright, Taylor Shilling, Michael K. Williams and Estevez himself, which he also wrote, directed and produced. The movie was shot entirely inside the downtown Cincinnati Public Library during the winter of 2017. Once again, The Public enjoyed it's world premiere at the Toronto Film Festival in 2018. The film was released in 2019 by Greenwich Entertainment and Universal Pictures.\n\nIn 2021, Emilio returns as Coach Gordon Bombay in the new Disney + series, The Mighty Ducks: Gamechangers.\n\nIntriguing, inspiring, and never less than interesting -- key adjectives in describing the career of Beverly D'Angelo, which has well passed the four-decade mark. Perhaps deserving better movies than she generally found herself in, she nevertheless was always an object of fascination and the one to watch...whatever the role. Hardly the shrinking violet type, Hollywood counted on her for her colorful personality, down-to-earth demeanor and scene-stealing capabilities.\n\nBeverly Heather D'Angelo was born on November 15, 1951 in Columbus, Ohio, the daughter of musicians Priscilla Ruth (Smith), a violinist, and Eugene Constantino \"Gene\" D'Angelo, a bass player who also managed a TV station. Her maternal grandfather, Howard Dwight Smith, was the architect who designed the Ohio (\"Horseshoe\") Stadium at Ohio State University. Her mother had English, Irish, Scottish, and German ancestry, and her father was of Italian descent. Beverly once attended an American school in Florence, Italy.\n\nInitially drawn to art, Beverly worked as a animator/cartoonist at Hanna-Barbera Productions before moving to Canada to pursue a rock singing career, To make ends meet she worked as a session vocalist and sang anyplace she could -- from coffeehouses to topless bars. At one point the teenager was invited to join up with rockabilly legend Ronnie Hawkins. Beverly's acting career started up when she left the Hawkins band and joined the Charlottetown Festival repertory company. She was touring Canada as Ophelia in \"Kronborg: 1582\", a rock musical version of Shakespeare's \"Hamlet\" when the renowned Colleen Dewhurst caught a performance and saw promise in both Beverly and the show. Eventually musical director Gower Champion got into the mix and the show was completely revamped, becoming the rock musical \"Rockabye Hamlet\", which made its way to Broadway in 1976. While the show itself was short-lived, Beverly's Ophelia attracted fine notices and she soon found herself on the West coast with film and TV opportunities. After this point, she seldom returned to the stage but did star alongside Ed Harris in the 1995 off-Broadway production of Sam Shepard's \"Simpatico\", which earned her a Theatre World Award.\n\nA role in the TV miniseries Der Preis der Macht (1976) led to bit parts in Hexensabbat (1977) and in the Woody Allen classic Der Stadtneurotiker (1977). A string of co-starring roles followed with First Love (1977), the Clint Eastwood starrer Der Mann aus San Fernando (1978) and the film adaptation of the hit counterculture musical Hair (1979). Best of all for Beverly was her powerhouse featured performance as the one-and-only Patsy Cline in the acclaimed biopic Nashville Lady (1980). Both she and Oscar winner Sissy Spacek (as fellow country singer Loretta Lynn) expertly supplied their own vocals.\n\nPlaying everything from tough-as-nails prostitutes, party girls and barflies to rich, prim widows and depressed, alcoholic moms, most of Beverly's output was solid during this time. Playing happening kind of gals, she customarily rose above much of the standard comedic or dramatic material given. An interesting gallery of offbeat characters came her way in a number of hit-or-miss features: Ich brauche einen Erben (1981), Der Chaos-Express (1984), Sterben... und leben lassen (1986), Traumfrau vom Dienst (1987), High Spirits - Die Geister sind willig! (1988), Cold Front - Ein Killer läuft Amok (1989), Die Erbschleicher (1990), Ein Papst zum Küssen (1991), Man Trouble (1992), Lightning Jack (1994), Zwei Satansbraten außer Rand und Band (1994), Merchants of Venus (1998) and Sugar Town (1999). She also sang in a few of these films.\n\nBeverly attracted mainstream notice as Chevy Chase's beleaguered wife in the comedy spoof Die schrillen Vier auf Achse (1983) and its three sequels. Stronger roles came with such films as the English/Irish production Miracle - Ein geheimnisvoller Sommer (1991) and the Neo-Nazi film American History X (1998). She was also a favorite of director John Schlesinger who used her in Da steht der ganze Freeway Kopf (1981) and Auge um Auge (1996), among others. In the spoof Hilfe, meine Frau ist ein Saurier! (1996), in which she served as associate producer, Beverly gamely starred as a chic Beverly Hills housewife who turns into a flying prehistoric reptile by night. Other offbeat independent filming includes Illuminata (1998), Merchants of Venus (1998), Weaver of Claybank (1915), Black Water Transit (2009), House Bunny (2008), Episode #7.33 (2007), Bounty Killer (2013), Frat Pack (2018) and Dreamland (2016).\n\nOn TV, Beverly scored well as matricide victim Kitty Menendez in Familiendrama in Beverly Hills - Die Geschichte der Menendez-Brüder (1994) and earned an Emmy-nomination (and arguably gave the best performance) as Stella Kowalski opposite \"Hair\" co-star Treat Williams in the TV remake of Endstation Sehnsucht (1984). Other topnotch TV mini-movies included Sündiges Geheimnis - Ich liebe den Freund meiner Mutter (1996) and Das jüngste Gericht - John Lists Story (1993), in which she played Robert Blake's devout wife. On primetime she has been cast quite assertively in recurring parts -- she has been spotted on Law & Order: Special Victims Unit (1999) as a defense attorney; Entourage (2004) as a talent agent; Shooter (2016) as a national security advisor; and Insatiable (2018) as a scheming beauty contestant coach.\n\nBeverly's off-camera romantic life has been just as interesting. Following her relationship with \"Hair\" director Milos Forman, she married Lorenzo Salviati, an economics student who also was an Italian duke. She left Hollywood and lived with him in Europe, but separated after two years and returned. A six-year relationship with Irish director Neil Jordan was followed by one with Oscar-winning production designer Anton Furst; this ended tragically when, just weeks after their breakup, he committed suicide. A former union with the volatile Al Pacino produced twins Olivia and Anton, who were born in 2001.\n\nThese days, Beverly's career on camera has remained secondary to the raising of her children. Occasionally she has made use of her vocal talents performing at L.A. nightclubs and with a jazz band that included brother Jeff. From time to time she still lights up the screen as a brash professional or somebody's colorful mom; whatever time she has on screen, whether major or minor, it is always welcomed and never, ever less than...interesting.\n\nAward-winning Canadian actress Susan Clark, born on March 8, 1943, took up acting at an early age (12) in her hometown of Sarnia, Ontario. Her family moved to Toronto around that period of time and she joined the Toronto Children's Players Theatre. Her first professional curtain call took place on the musical stage in a 1955 production of \"Silk Stockings\" which starred veteran actor Don Ameche.\n\nThe \"acting bug\" bit hard and a very determined Susan pressed her family to allow her to study at London's prestigious Royal Academy of Dramatic Arts. She gained valuable experience in repertory, making her London debut in \"Poor Bitos\" in the early 1960s. She even got a taste of on-camera work when she won multiple roles on a 1965 episode of The Benny Hill Show (1957). Returning to Canada, however, due to the illness of her father, she subsequently decided to trek, instead, to Los Angeles to continue her professional career. In search of on-camera work, she attracted notice in some guest roles on TV and this eventually led to a Universal contract. The ten-year contract was one of the last of its kind as Hollywood was witnessing the demise of the studio contract system.\n\nAfter gaining some exposure on episodes of Die Leute von der Shiloh Ranch (1962) and Wettlauf mit dem Tod (1965), Susan's first screen assignment for Universal was as the second female lead in the soap-styled drama 25000 Dollar für einen Mann (1967) starring Robert Wagner, in one of his typical jet-setting playboy parts, and the scintillating Jill St. John, who would wed her \"Banning\" leading man two decades later. From there, Susan only grew in stature. Playing the second female lead again in the critically-praised crimer Nur noch 72 Stunden (1968) starring Richard Widmark and Inger Stevens, she finally earned top female billing opposite Clint Eastwood in Coogans großer Bluff (1968) playing a sexy parole officer and enjoying romantic clinches with the up-and-coming film icon on film.\n\nTall and willowy with incandescent blue eyes, Susan continued to impress on celluloid with roles in Blutige Spur (1969), Valdez (1971) and, in particular, Zwei Galgenvögel (1971). It was 70s TV-movies, however, that would take full advantage of Susan's vibrant, intelligent acting talents. First came the tender-hearted mini-movie Big John macht Dampf (1968). While a vehicle for Bonanza's Dan Blocker, co-star Susan made a strong, spunky impression as his small-town romantic interest. This was followed by choice roles in Herausforderung zum Grand-Prix (1970) and The Astronaut (1972).\n\n1975 was a banner year for Susan who not only provided a couple of excellent scenes as Gene Hackman's wife in the film-noir Die heiße Spur (1975) but, made a resounding, Emmy-winning impression on TV audiences as feminist track-and-field Olympian-turned-golf star Babe Didrikson Zaharias, who is later felled by cancer, in the TV mini-bio Babe (1975). This was a pronounced victory for Susan both professionally and personally for it was on this set that she met her second husband, co-star Alex Karras, who played Babe's spouse George. Susan was in immediate demand and was quickly cast as another feisty, ill-fated heroine, this time in the form of famed aviatrix Amelia Earhart (1976). Predictably, Susan was wonderful and earned a second Emmy nomination for her efforts (she didn't win).\n\nShe and Karras (who had a child, Katie, in 1980) went on to jointly act in and/or produce various film and TV projects, including the TV movies Jimmy B. & André (1980), and Maid in America (1982), and the films Nobody's Perfekt (1981) and Porky's (1981). This culminated in their biggest collaborative effort with the sitcom series Webster (1983) wherein both were unmercifully upstaged by the hopelessly cute antics of its tyke star Emmanuel Lewis. While the series hardly tested the couple's acting mettle and the plot was pretty much a \"Diff'rent Strokes\" rehash, the show proved quite popular on its own and put Clark and Karras firmly on the TV map between 1983 to 1988. Susan, herself, earned a Golden Globe nomination for \"Best Actress in a Comedy Series\".\n\nFollowing the sitcom' demise, Susan relinquished the limelight a bit and found contentment on the local Southern California stage. Relishing acting challenges in such wide-ranging plays as \"Meetin's on the Porch\" (1990) with Patty Duke and Carrie Snodgress, \"Afterplay\" (1998), \"Bicoastal Women\" (2003) and \"The Importance of Being Earnest\" (2004) (as Lady Bracknell), she eventually became a dedicated member of the Rubicon Theater Company in Los Angeles, gracing such plays there as \"The Glass Menagerie\", \"Dancing at Lughnasa\", \"The Devil's Disciple\" and, most recently, \"A Delicate Balance.\"\n\nFeatured in the TV movies Verloren im Schneesturm - Eine Familie kämpft ums Überleben (1994), Die Eisprinzessin und das Biest - Die wahre Geschichte von Tonya und Nancy (1994) and Toe Tags (1996), she was last seen on camera co-starring in the dramatic TV series Emily of New Moon (1998) as ever-rigid Aunt Elizabeth, who assists in raising her orphaned niece.\n\nSusan has a daughter, Katie, by husband Karras who died of kidney failure in 2012."
