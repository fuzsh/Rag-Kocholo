        "text": "Popped Hot Air Balloon, And Suckers\n\nBy Gerard Sarnat\n\nQuailBellMagazine.com\n\n\"Big Red was her favorite horse until I stripped down.”\n\n-- Charles “Hank” Bukowski\n\nBorn Andernach, Rhineland-Palatinate, Germany,\n\nraised South Central LA, racetracks\n\nback in the Reagan years\n\nmay have been Buk’s version\n\nof Herman Hesse´s anti-fascist Magister Ludi.\n\nThere was a bunch of us cocky experts\n\nwho hung out besotted among the crappy leftover buntings\n\nand balloons at the top of Hollywood Park’s\n\nstretch section of the bleachers.\n\nPractically every day I was there, including\n\nthe weekend of our high school ball.\n\nHank sat about ten rows behind -- even worse view\n\nalbeit the decisive action takes place around that turn.\n\nThe huge beast who didn’t wear clothes well was always alone.\n\nFinally I got up the nerve to ask him to autograph\n\nthe Daily Racing Form I gave to my kind of date\n\ninstead of a corsage.\n\nOne day following him through the trash of torn tickets\n\nto the $2 window, we couldn't believe our ears:\n\nHank bet the goddamn favorite to show!\n\nFor all his horse race ruminations,\n\nthe Master of the Game actually knew nothing.\n\n#Unreal #Bukowski #BigRed #PoppedHotAirBalloon #BeatPoets #Germany"
