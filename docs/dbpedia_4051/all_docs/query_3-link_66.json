        "text": "Bruce Willis (born March 19, 1955) is an internationally renowned American actor, made famous by his role of John McClane in the original Die Hard. He has since reprised the role in all of its sequels, something no other actor has accomplished in the series; Die Hard 2, Die Hard with a Vengeance, Live Free or Die Hard and A Good Day to Die Hard. He had previously confirmed there would be a sixth and final installment, titled Die Hardest. However, in 2022 he retired from acting amid health concerns.\n\nCareer\n\nWillis has appeared in the number of successful movies, including The Last Boy Scout, Striking Distance, Pulp Fiction, 12 Monkeys, The Fifth Element, Armageddon, Mercury Rising, The Sixth Sense, Unbreakable, Sin City, The Whole Nine Yards and its sequel The Whole Ten Yards, Tears of the Sun, Hostage, 16 Blocks, The Expendables and it's sequel The Expendables 2, RED and its sequel RED 2, Looper, Moonrise Kingdom and G.I. Joe: Retaliation. He also had a lead voice acting role in Over the Hedge.\n\nIn 2022, Willis has retired from acting amid health concerns after being diagnosed with aphasia, a language disorder caused by brain damage that affects a person’s ability to communicate. As of 2023, he is no longer verbal.\n\nAs John McClane\n\nWillis was finally hired to interpret John McClane in the first Die Hard movie, in 1988, after director John McTiernan offered the script of the movie and thew the role to a variety of action stars, including Sylvester Stallone, Harrison Ford, and Don Johnson, all of whom turned it down.\n\nDemographic data from CinemaScore helped persuade the studio and director John McTiernan to cast Willis. He was paid $5 million to star in the film, a figure virtually unheard of at the time for an actor who had starred in only one moderately successful film, and normally paid to the major stars of the time, such as Dustin Hoffman and Warren Beatty.\n\nMcClane's character role catapulted Willis to movie star and action hero status. After the success of the first Die Had film, Willis would reprise his role as John McClane in the four sequels, which also were box office successes.\n\nFilmography\n\nFilm\n\nYear Title Role Notes 1979 The Driller Killer Whitey 1979 Goldengirl Sheen 1979 The In-Laws Woody 1980 Cruising Larry 1980 Template:Sortname Man Entering Diner (uncredited) 1981 Prince of the City Extra 1982 Template:Sortname Courtroom Observer 1983 Trackdown: Finding the Goodbar Killer Man Entering Diner UncreditedTemplate:Citation needed 1984 The Natural Moff 1987 Blind Date Walter Davis 1988 Sunset Tom Mix Also co-executive producer Die Hard John McClane 1989 In Country Emmett Smith Nominated – Golden Globe Award for Best Supporting Actor – Motion Picture Look Who's Talking Mikey (voice) That's Adequate Himself Mockumentary 1990 Die Hard 2 John McClane Look Who's Talking Too Mikey (voice) Template:Sortname Peter Fallow 1991 Mortal Thoughts James Urbanski Hudson Hawk Eddie \"Hudson Hawk\" Hawkins Also writer\n\nGolden Raspberry Award for Worst Screenplay\n\nNominated – Golden Raspberry Award for Worst Actor Billy Bathgate Bo Weinberg Template:Sortname Joseph Cornelius \"Joe\" Hallenbeck Nominated – MTV Movie Award for Best On-Screen Duo (shared with Damon Wayans) 1992 Template:Sortname Himself Cameo Death Becomes Her Dr. Ernest Menville Nominated – American Comedy Award for Funniest Actor in a Motion Picture (Leading Role)\n\nNominated – Saturn Award for Best Actor 1993 Loaded Weapon 1 John McClane Uncredited cameoTemplate:Citation needed Striking Distance Tom \"Tommy\" Hardy 1994 Color of Night Dr. Bill Capa Stinkers Bad Movie Award for Worst Actor\n\nNominated – Golden Raspberry Award for Worst Actor North Narrator Pulp Fiction Butch Coolidge Nominated – Chlotrudis Award for Best Supporting Actor Nobody's Fool Carl Roebuck 1995 Die Hard with a Vengeance John McClane Four Rooms Leo Uncredited\n\nSegment: \"The Man from Hollywood\" 12 Monkeys James Cole Nominated – Saturn Award for Best Actor 1996 Last Man Standing John Smith Beavis and Butt-Head Do America Muddy Grimes (voice) 1997 The Fifth Element Korben Dallas Nominated – Online Film & Television Association Award for Best Sci-Fi/Fantasy/Horror Actor Template:Sortname The Jackal Nominated – Blockbuster Entertainment Award for Favorite Actor - Suspense 1998 Mercury Rising Art Jeffries Golden Raspberry Award for Worst Actor Armageddon Harry S.
