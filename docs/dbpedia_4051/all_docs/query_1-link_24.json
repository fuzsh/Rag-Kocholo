This family includes about 3000 described species worldwide, including 161 in the genus Pseudolycoriella. Sciarids are also commonly known as ‘black fungus gnats’, and in nature their larvae are mainly found in decomposing plant material where fungal activity is apparent. Pseudolycoriella hygida is one of the few sciarid species that has been successfully maintained in culture under laboratory conditions for several decades. Since the original culture was established nearly 60 years ago, studies on Psl. hygida have contributed to the understanding of different aspects of insect biology. The aim of this work is to deepen our understanding of this species by presenting previously unpublished morphological, cytological, and molecular data. Apart from contributing to the characterization of Psl. hygida, this work is an important resource for future studies on the biology of both Sciaridae and Diptera.\n\nAbstract\n\nPseudolycoriella hygida (Sauaia & Alves, 1968) is a sciarid that has been continuously cultured in the laboratory for nearly 60 years. Studies on this species have contributed to the understanding of DNA puffs, which are characteristic of Sciaridae, and to the knowledge of more general aspects of insect biology, including cell death, nucleolar organization, and the role of the hormone ecdysone during molting. The genome of Psl. hygida has now been sequenced, and it is the third publicly available sciarid genome. The aim of this work is to expand the current knowledge on Psl. hygida. The morphology of the adults is revisited. The morphology of larvae and pupae is described, together with the behavior of immature stages under laboratory conditions. Cytogenetic maps of the salivary gland polytene chromosomes are presented, together with a comparative analysis of the mitotic chromosomes of six different sciarid species. Pseudolycoriella hygida was originally described as a species of Bradysia and recently moved to Pseudolycoriella. We examine here the systematic position of Psl. hygida in the latter genus. Our results extend the characterization of an unconventional model organism and constitute an important resource for those working on the cytogenetics, ecology, taxonomy, and phylogenetic systematics of sciarids.\n\nKeywords: Sciaroidea, Sciaridae, Pseudolycoriella, Neotropical Region, cytogenetics, morphology, systematics, literature review\n\n1. Introduction\n\nThe fly family Sciaridae Billberg, 1820 (black fungus gnats) contains about 3000 described species worldwide [1], of which 161 belong to the genus Pseudolycoriella Menzel & Mohrig, 1998 [2,3,4]. Most sciarids are blackish-brown, with grayish or brownish wing membranes, but the bodies of some species are patterned with light brown, orange, or yellowish. The Sciaridae belong to the superfamily Sciaroidea and display a broad geographic distribution, inhabiting diverse environments ranging from sub-arctic to desert regions, with a correspondingly wide range of colonized terrestrial habitats [5,6,7]. There are currently about 300 described species of sciarids in the Neotropical realm, although the classification of many of these species needs to be revised [8]. Further research will certainly increase the number of genera and species recognized in the region, as is the case of Pseudolycoriella.\n\nA current hypothesis, based on both morphological and molecular data, is that during the course of evolution, the larvae of some sciarids shifted from feeding on dead plant material (plant litter and/or rotten wood) to feeding on living plants [5]. Abundant decaying vegetable material often leads to high population levels of sciarids, some of which become pests. The larvae of synanthropic species can feed on plants or mushrooms of economic importance, and although increasing attention has been given in the literature to these pest species, they represent only a small fraction of the diversity of this family [9,10].\n\nSciarids have played a key role in the development of our understanding of genetics; however, to some extent, this contribution has been overlooked in historical accounts of the subject. In many dipteran larval tissues, including the salivary glands, the interphase chromosomes are polytene, which arise from multiple rounds of DNA replication without the separation of the sister chromatids. The quantity of DNA in polytene nuclei increases in geometric steps and is accompanied by an increase in cell size. Polyteny is understood as an effective mechanism that accelerates growth and enhances gene expression [11]. These gigantic chromosomes were initially described by Balbiani [12], and their morphology and chemical nature were elucidated through studies on species of bibionids, Chironomus Meigen, 1803, and Drosophila Fallén, 1823 in the 1930s (reviewed in [11,13]). Since the 1920s, different sciarid species have been used as model organisms to investigate some key aspects of genetics. An unusual mechanism of chromosome elimination and sex determination in sciarids was initially described in the 1920s by Charles W. Metz (reviewed in [14]). In the 1950s, Marta E. Breuer and Crodowaldo Pavan investigated DNA puffing patterns, the increase in DNA content, and the abundant transcription occurring in DNA puff-forming regions in the salivary gland polytene chromosomes at the end of the fourth larval instar (reviewed in [15,16]). In the following decades, various groups both in Brazil and in the United States worked on the molecular characterization of sciarid DNA puffs, which contributed to the understanding of eukaryotic origins of DNA replication (reviewed in [17,18,19]).\n\nThe role of ecdysone in sciarid DNA puff formation, transcription, and amplification was initially investigated by Helen V. Crouse in the 1960s and further expanded upon by other research groups working with various sciarid species as model organisms. Together, these studies contributed to the understanding of the role of ecdysone in DNA puff formation, transcription, and DNA replication in DNA puff-forming regions (reviewed in [20]). Besides the characterization of processes typical of sciarids—namely, the unusual mechanism of sex determination and DNA puff formation—the study of sciarids also contributed to the understanding of telomere organization, nucleolar structure [21], antimicrobial peptides, and cell death [22] (reviewed in [18]). More recently, the research focus has shifted to insecticide resistance [23] and to the characterization of germ line restricted chromosomes that occur in a few groups across the tree of life, including sciarids, cecidomyiids, and chironomids (reviewed in [24]).\n\nPseudolycoriella hygida (female adult in ) was originally described by Heni Sauaia and Maurílio A.R. Alves as a species of Bradysia Winnertz, 1867 [25] and recently moved to the genus Pseudolycoriella [26]. Rearing this species in the laboratory began with two females in 1965 in the Cellular Biology Laboratory of the Medical School of the University of São Paulo in Ribeirão Preto. The species was formally described with considerable detail based on adults [25], and the culture has been successfully maintained ever since. In 2016, the culture was transferred to the School of Pharmaceutical Sciences on the same university campus. Through the years, different laboratories in the state of São Paulo and Paraná have maintained Psl. hygida cultures with different degrees of success. Presently, this sciarid is cultivated in Ribeirão Preto, state of São Paulo (FCFRP-USP) and in Maringá, state of Paraná (UEM, State University of Maringá).\n\nThe life cycle of Psl. hygida lasts 41 days at 22 °C. Different diets, all based on partly decomposed leaves, have been employed over the years [27]. The use of diets with defined composition has been attempted. However, a decline in viability has been reported after some generations [28,29]. At present, the cultures of Psl. hygida are maintained on a diet of partly decomposed leaves of Ilex paraguariensis Saint Hilaire, 1822, which can be supplemented during the fourth larval instar with an artificial diet of defined composition [26,27].\n\nThe studies in Heni Sauaia’s laboratory in the 1970s and 1980s investigated the DNA and RNA puffs in the salivary gland chromosomes of Psl. hygida. By using a combination of cytological analysis and larval injection of drugs that either inhibit DNA synthesis or chemically modify DNA and radiolabeled precursors, his group confirmed that sciarid DNA puffs are sites of developmentally regulated gene amplification and abundant RNA synthesis [18,20,30,31,32]. Subsequent studies showed that the regulated synthesis of groups of salivary gland proteins was related to the expansion and regression of specific DNA puffs [33,34]. The observation that many of the DNA puff proteins were also found in the saliva of fourth instar larvae provided support for the idea that DNA amplification is a mechanism selected to provide a short-term boost in the amounts of those proteins that are destined to build the cocoon [33,34].\n\nIn the following years, Psl. hygida was employed as a model organism by different research groups both in Maringá and Ribeirão Preto. These studies included the characterization of the mitotic chromosomes and nucleolar organizing regions [35,36], the molecular characterization of DNA puff-forming regions (reviewed in [18,20]), the direct demonstration that DNA puff proteins are employed to build the cocoon [37,38], studies in transgenic Drosophila, as well as those that determined the levels of ecdysone titers and the role of the hormone on DNA puff gene expression at the end of the fourth larval instar (reviewed in [20]). Further studies established the mechanisms of programmed cell death in larval organs [18,22]. Together, these studies represent a consolidated contribution in the area of insect molecular biology and further emphasize the relevance of studying unconventional model organisms, such as sciarids.\n\nThe Psl. hygida genome has recently been sequenced, and an annotated version of the genome is available in the public databases [26]. The analysis of the Psl. hygida mitochondrial genome revealed that it contains all 13 protein coding genes, 22 tRNAs and 2 rRNAs characteristic of insect mitogenomes, and an unusually large control region of about 21 kb. A phylogenetic analysis based on Bibionomorpha mitogenome sequences reconstructed the phylogeny of the Bibionomorpha infraorder supported the monophyly of Sciaridae and revealed subfamily and genus-specific gene rearrangements [39]. The Psl. hygida genome is the third sciarid genome to be published and the first for the genus Pseudolycoriella, constituting a significant contribution to the field of Diptera genomics and to those working on sciarid biology [26]. However, some cytological and morphological aspects of Psl. hygida have not been previously published.\n\nWe present here an updated description of Psl. hygida adults and the first description of the morphology and behavior of immature stages, which were obtained from the long-term Psl. hygida laboratory culture. The identification and classification of the species based on morphological characters of the adults are presented together with a COI-based ML tree that reveals the position of Psl. hygida in the genus Pseudolycoriella. The description of the larval salivary gland polytene chromosomes was made more than 50 years ago [40], and photomicrographs of these chromosomes have been shown in different studies [32,41,42]. Here, we revisit the first description of these chromosomes and present a high-quality cytogenetical map that has remained unpublished since it was originally drawn. Additionally, we include a comparison between sciarid mitotic chromosomes displaying marks, such as centromere and nucleolar organizer. Taken together, these data extend the characterization of a sciarid species that has been employed as a model organism for over 55 years, and they provide a valuable resource for those studying the morphology, cytogenetics, and evolution of sciarids in particular and dipterans in general.\n\n2. Materials and Methods\n\n2.1. Cultivation and Life Cycle of Pseudolycoriella hygida\n\nAll specimens investigated in this work are derived from the culture currently maintained in the Monesi laboratory, located on the campus of the Universidade de São Paulo in Ribeirão Preto, Brazil. Pseudolycoriella hygida was maintained in plastic cultivation boxes (11 × 11 × 3.4 cm) layered with humid soil as previously described [26,34,43]. The life cycle lasts about 41 days at 22 °C [26], and although shorter durations for the life cycle (36 days) have been reported, the differences are mainly the result of cultivation at lower temperatures (20 °C) (for example, [34,41]) and/or not taking into account the 9-day-long embryonic development [43]. At 22 °C, the embryonic, larval, pupal, and adult stages last about 9 days, 22 days, 5 days, and 5 days, respectively.\n\nThe embryonic stage has been previously described [43], as well as the developmental stages of late fourth instar larvae, which is based on changes in the shape, size, and position of the eyespots [34]. The larval stage comprises three molts and four instars, and the larvae feed continuously on a diet of partially decomposed Ilex paraguariensis leaves. During the fourth larval stage, the diet can be supplemented with an artificial diet of defined composition (1.2% yeast extract, 1.4% cornstarch, 0.8% oatmeal flour, 1.2% agar). At the end of larval development, the larvae build individual cocoons in the soil. Psl. hygida is a digenic species, and the ratio between females and males is 5:1. The males emerge before the females, and copulation occurs as soon as the females emerge. Egg laying starts 24–48 h later. A female lays between 100 and 200 eggs [40,44]. Under laboratory conditions, no food is offered to the adults, which live for only 5 days.\n\n2.2. Molecular Methods and Techniques\n\n2.2.1. Preparation of Polytene Chromosome Spreads\n\nSalivary glands were dissected and immersed in 7% perchloric acid for at least 2 h. The most anterior region was transferred to a drop of 50% acetic acid and squashed between the slide and coverslip. After removal of the excess acetic acid, the coverslips were sealed with paraffin. Photographs were taken under phase contrast with a Universal Microscope (Carl Zeiss GmbH, Jena, Germany).\n\n2.2.2. Preparation of Polytene Chromosome Maps\n\nLarvae at the E5 eyespot stage were used for chromosome spreads as well as photographs. At this stage, most DNA puff primordia can already be observed. Several slides were inspected and photographed, including those from larvae at the same stage but from different cultivation boxes. To construct the map, photographs of the same chromosome were compared in order to rule out variations that could lead to map imprecisions.\n\n2.2.3. Preparation of Mitotic/Meiotic Chromosome Schemes\n\nSeveral photographs displaying the whole chromosome complement of the six studied species were used. Chromosome lengths within the chromosome complement of the same species were measured, taking the largest autosome (A/IV) as a reference size (2.1–2.3 cm) for the other chromosomes within the same complement, and depicted proportionally in the chromosome schemes. The following data were employed for the scheme construction: Pseudosciara pubescens (Morgante, 1969) (as Trichosia) [45,46], Rhynchosciara americana (Wiedemann, 1821) [21,46,47], Schwenckfeldina sp. (as ‘Schwenkfeldina’; misspelling) [21,46], Lycoriella ingenua (Dufour, 1839) (as Sciara pauciseta) [48], Bradysia tilicola (Loew, 1850) (as Sciara coprophila) [49], and Pseudolycoriella hygida (Sauaia & Alves, 1968) (as Bradysia) [50].\n\n2.2.4. Molecular Analysis Based on COI Barcodes\n\nThe genomic DNA of all specimens with the sample ID beginning with ‘SDEI-Dipt’ was extracted at the Senckenberg Deutsches Entomologisches Institut (SDEI) using the EZNA Tissue DNA Kit (Omega Biotek, Norcross, GA, USA), following the manufacturer’s protocol. The extracted DNA was stored at −20 °C for later use. Typically, the entire specimen was used for DNA extraction. For the phylogenetic analyses, the mitochondrial region of the cytochrome oxidase subunit I gene (COI) was sequenced using the primers LCO_1490 and HCO_2198, which amplify the entire standard barcode region (658 bp) of the animal kingdom [51]. If these primers did not produce sufficient results, the primers LepF1 and LepR1 [52] or LCO_1490 and HCO_2198 in combination with the internal primers sym-C1-J-1718 [53] and C1-N1760 [54] were used. PCR products were purified and sequenced using an ABI3730XL sequencer with the Big Dye v. 3.1 Terminator Kit (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Schwerte, Germany) by Macrogen Europe (Amsterdam, The Netherlands). Sequences were manually edited using Geneious 9.1.2 [55] and aligned using BioEdit 7.2.5 [56].\n\nThe phylogenetic tree was constructed using the Maximum Likelihood (ML) method implemented in IQ-TREE 1.6.91 [57]. The best-fitting models for the analyses were determined using ModelFinder [58], which resulted in GTR+F+I+G4. The ML analysis included 1000 Ultrafast Bootstrap Approximation (UFBoot) replications using all sites. The tree was drawn to scale, with branch lengths corresponding to substitutions per site. The analysis included nucleotide sequences from 62 specimens (48 individuals of 44 Pseudolycoriella species and single individuals of 14 outgroup representatives), and the pairwise proportion of differences per nucleotide site (p-distance) between all sequences was calculated using MEGAX [59] with the pairwise-deletion option (Table S1). All codon positions were included. UFBoot values are reported for 95% and above.\n\n2.3. Morphological Methods and Techniques\n\n2.3.1. Slide-Mounting and Imaging of Immature Stages\n\nSpecimens of each larval stage were selected from the culture, together with male and female pupae. At least one specimen of each stage was permanently mounted on a microscope slide and deposited in the Museu de Zoologia, Universidade de São Paulo (MZUSP), São Paulo, Brazil. Specimens were cleared with KOH, dehydrated in ethanol, and mounted in Canada balsam (modified from [60]). The habitus and morphological details of the structures were imaged using light microscopy and photographed with a LEICA DC500 camera attached to a LEICA stereomicroscope model MZ-16 and to a compound microscope model LEICA DM2500 (all from Leica Microsystems GmbH, Wetzlar, Germany). Photos were stacked with Helicon Focus 6. Images were edited with Adobe Photoshop CC, and plates were prepared with Adobe Illustrator CC.\n\n2.3.2. Slide-Mounting and Imaging of Adults\n\nA stereo zoom microscope OLYMPUS SZX12 in combination with a ring light system OLYMPUS KL 2500 LCD was used for the preparation of adults. All sciarid specimens were initially preserved in 70% ethanol. They were first transferred to 96% ethanol and then subjected to a creosote treatment (approx. 15 min per step). The creosote step allowed residual dehydration of imagines and lightening of very dark, heavily sclerotized body parts. After dehydration, the adults were placed in lateral view on slides with a liquid Canada balsam/xylene mixture. Females were positioned under a coverslip without prior dissection of body parts ( ). For males, genitalia were separated under permanent microscopic observation with two clamped insect needles (size 1) and embedded in the ventral view next to the body [61]. A HERAEUS Instruments T6060 oven with a constant operating temperature of 50 °C was used to dry the permanent slides over a period of two to three weeks.\n\nA fully automated LEICA DM6 B microscope system was used in the morphological examination and measurement of adult specimens. The microscope was equipped with HC PLAN eyepieces (10×), seven objective lenses (1.25×, 5×, 10×, 20×, 40×, 63×, 100×), an intermediate magnification changer (1.0×, 1.25×, 1.6×), and an LAS interactive measurement module. Images were documented with a LEICA DMC6200 digital camera mounted on the LEICA DM6 B microscope (both Leica Microsystems GmbH, Wetzlar, Germany). Between 10 and 40 images were taken at different focal planes, stacked, and fully automatically computed into a depth-sharp photo with the LAS Montage MultiFocus software, version 4.13.0. Images were edited with Zooner Photo Studio, version 10, and arranged as plates with Adobe Photoshop CS6, version 13.0. After completion of the morphological studies, 44 permanent slides of 62 Psl. hygida adults were deposited in the Diptera collection of the Senckenberg German Entomological Institute (SDEI) in Müncheberg, Germany (for details see Section 3.4).\n\n2.4.

Results\n\n3.1. Pseudolycoriella hygida in the Literature\n\nIn the past 55 years, Pseudolycoriella hygida has either itself been the subject of scientific investigations or the species has been used for comparison with other study objects. Our literature search retrieved 71 publications in which the name ‘hygida Sauaia & Alves’ occurs. Of these, 68 were in cytogenetics and/or molecular biology, and 2 were in taxonomy and systematics. Only Trinca et al. [26] took an interdisciplinary approach by linking research results from genetics and systematics. In the following overview, the cited publications that appeared between 1968 and 2023 are listed chronologically, because the results of one study generally form the basis of the next.

Development and Behavior of Immatures and Adults\n\nAt 22 °C, first instar larvae hatched from eggs between the 9th and 10th day of embryonic development, already showing a sclerotized cephalic capsule. First instar larvae began to feed immediately after hatching, and the gut darkened due to the presence of ingested matter ( A,B). During the whole larval stage, the larvae secreted saliva onto the surface of the food, comprising partly decomposed Ilex paraguariensis leaves, and the larval groups spread out over the substrate. As the larvae began to move around, additional substrate was placed in the box. Larvae moved in groups, as is common in sciarids, from the older food that was exposed to saliva to the fresher food. Second instar larvae molted on the fourth day of larval development, staying close to the bottom of the box. Second instar larvae could be observed with or without the sclerotized cephalic capsule during this transition, but all larvae usually had a sclerotized cephalic capsule by the fifth day. Third instar larvae emerged on the eighth day, with a new replacement of the cephalic capsule. During the third instar, the larval gut became even darker.\n\nThe molt of the fourth instar larva occurred between the 11th and 12th day of development and was accompanied by another change of the cephalic capsule. The food of fourth instar larvae was augmented with an artificial supplement of defined composition (for details, see Section 2.1). Within 18 days, larvae at stage E1 (eyespot pattern 1) could be seen [34], while the larvae began to feed mainly on the artificial diet at stage E5. From stage E5 onwards, the artificial diet was added to the edges of the leaf-based food and on the soil, which induced the larvae to migrate towards the soil. After stage E7, larvae buried themselves in the soil, adopted a half-moon shape, stopped moving, and started to build individual cocoons. At the beginning of pupation, the fourth instar integument moved posteriorly, and the cephalic capsule remained attached at the posterior end of the pupa ( C). Adults emerged mostly on the fifth day after pupation. Males usually emerged before females and moved around the female pupae. As soon as the females emerged, copulation occurred. Females started laying eggs 24–48 h after emerging. Adults lived for about 5 days [26].\n\n3.3. Description of Immature Stages\n\nLarva ( A,B, and A–D).

Identification and Classification of Pseudolycoriella hygida Based on Morphological Characters of Adults\n\nOf the 161 described Pseudolycoriella species, 135 species have been classified into 10 species groups based on the morphological characters of male adults [3,61,63,68,71] as follows: Psl. aculeacera group (5 species; erroneously also referred to as ‘Psl. ovistyla group’ for the same species group in [71]); Psl. bruckii group (74 species); Psl. horribilis group (2 species); Psl. longicostalis group (11 species); Psl. macrotegmenta group (14 species; formerly also referred to as ‘macrotegmenta complex’); Psl. morenae group (2 species); Psl. nodulosa group (6 species; formerly also referred to as ‘nodulosa complex’ or subgenus Ostroverkhovana Komarova); Psl. quadrispinosa group (9 species); Psl. triacanthula group (8 species); and Psl. torva group (4 species).\n\nNo adequate species groups have yet been defined for the remaining 26 Pseudolycoriella species (16.15%) with deviating body and genital characters. They are currently still regarded as ‘unplaced’ within Pseudolycoriella. This ‘unplaced species mix’ also includes Psl. hygida (Sauaia & Alves, 1968) as well as Psl. coecoalata Mohrig, 2003 described from Costa Rica, Psl. florentissima Mohrig & Rulik, 2004 from Dominican Republic, Psl. nocturna Mohrig & Kauschke, 2019 from Canada, Psl. skusei Mohrig, Kauschke & Broadley, 2016 from Australia, Psl. senticosa Vilkamaa, Hippa & Mohrig, 2012, and Psl. tribulosa Vilkamaa, Hippa & Mohrig, 2012, both only known from New Caledonia. The males of these seven species have long, slender gonostyli with usually 3–4 mesial megasetae and at least one downcurved whiplash seta on the upper third of gonostylus, whereby intercoxal differentiations at the ventral base of gonocoxae are absent. Pseudolycoriella nocturna and Psl. skusei were excluded from further analysis because both species lack the curved margin of the anteroapical tibial organ. In addition, Psl. skusei has an unusually high, strongly narrowed tegmen with a very long aedeagus, and Psl. nocturna has untoothed claws and some setae on the mediotergite. Pseudolycoriella florentissima can also be ruled out, because in this species the tegmen has no finger-shaped median process and the gonostylar megasetae are arranged subapically in a narrow group, similarly to representatives of the Psl. bruckii species group. In the remaining species Psl. hygida, Psl. coecoalata, Psl. senticosa, and Psl. tribulosa, the mesial megasetae on the upper half of gonostylus are arranged one below the other, usually clearly separated from each other. These species can be divided into two morphotypes according to the coloration of the basal antennal flagellomeres, the surface structure on the basal portion of flagellomeres, the shape of gonostyli, the length of setae on medial gonostylar margin, the length and position of whiplash seta, and some structures of the aedeagus complex.\n\nMorphotype A (Psl. senticosa, Psl. tribulosa): Flagellomeres 1 and 2 yellow; basal portions of flagellomeres without conspicuous surface structures; gonostylus club-shaped, constricted at base; gonostylar apex not elongated, with linear inside edge; inner margin of gonostylus with setae moderately long, distinctly shorter than the whiplash seta; whiplash seta very long, inserted subapically close to the apex of gonostylus; base of aedeagus short, wide, funnel-shaped, and membranous; area of aedeagal teeth roundish, small.\n\nMorphotype B (Psl. hygida, Psl. coecoalata): Flagellomeres 1 and 2 dark brown; basal portions of flagellomeres with pit-shaped, partially honeycomb-like connected surface structure; gonostylus equally wide from base to apex, not constricted at base; gonostylar apex elongated, with angled inside; inner margin of gonostylus with setae long, only slightly shorter than the whiplash seta; whiplash seta distinctly shorter, inserted medially at the base of upper gonostylar third; base of aedeagus long, narrow, funnel-shaped, and sclerotized; area of aedeagal teeth band-shaped, narrow.\n\nBased on the morphological analysis carried out above, Psl. hygida (Sauaia & Alves) is closely related to Psl. coecoalata Mohrig, 2003 from Costa Rica, which was figured in detail by Mohrig [67] (compare with Figure 26a–f). The male of Psl. hygida differs from this species by its shorter flagellomeres (index of fourth flagellomere = 1.6–1.9), a shorter gonostylus with a wider apex and 3–4 mesial megaseta, a shorter tegmen (only as high as wide at the base) with a long finger-like process, and a short ejaculatory apodeme. In contrast, in Psl. coecoalata, the male flagellomeres are longer (index of fourth flagellomere = 2.4), the gonostylus is longer, with a narrower apex and only 2 megaseta on the medial side of the gonostylus, and the tegmen is significantly higher than wide. In addition, in Psl. coecoalata, the finger-like median process on the tegmen is only half as long and the strong ejaculatory apodeme of aedeagus twice as long as in Psl. hygida. Further differences exist in the setosity of some wing veins, which can be used for the identification of Psl. hygida and Psl. coecoalata in both sexes. The r-m vein is completely covered with macrotrichia in Psl. hygida (bare in Psl. coecoalata), and the distal area of R5 is also covered dorsally with macrotrichia (in Psl. coecoalata with ventral macrotrichia only). In addition, veins M1 and stM in Psl. hygida often retain some macrotrichia (atavism), which has not yet been observed in Psl. coecoalata.\n\n3.6. Genetic Identification and Relationship to Other COI-Analyzed Pseudolycoriella\n\nTo identify the genetic relationship of Psl. hygida to other Pseudolycoriella species and to evaluate genetic variability, we conducted a phylogenetic analysis using COI barcode sequences. The study presented here included 44 described Pseudolycoriella species of which the COI barcodes are currently known ( , ). In order to test the monophyly of Pseudolycoriella, 13 genus representatives of Sciaridae were selected that are currently either considered to belong to the ‘Pseudolycoriella genus group’ or may be close to this complex based on morphological structures, especially due to the presence of very long, mesial, or whiplash gonostylar setae [1,5].\n\nAmong them are specimens of 10 type species, representatives of 2 species groups postulated in Menzel and Mohrig [61] that differ morphologically from the type species of genera, and 1 available Spinopygina species ( ). The mycetophilid family Diadocidiidae Winnertz, 1863 was selected as the outgroup of Sciaridae, with the type genus Diadocidia Ruthe, 1831 and the type species Diadocidia ferruginosa (Meigen, 1830).\n\nOur analysis revealed that none of the three COI sequences of Psl. hygida from Argentina downloaded from BOLD (sample IDs BIOUG23645-D09, BIOUG23277-A10, BIOUG23471-G01; identified as ‘Sciaridae sp.’) nor the two barcodes of Psl. hygida from Brazil (sample IDs SDEI-Dipt-0002255, SDEI-Dipt-0002256) showed any intraspecific variability (0.00%) within each population. However, sequences of the specimens from Argentina diverged by 0.46% from those from Brazil. We attribute this intraspecific variability to the geographic distance between these populations. The COI analysis also showed that the five specimens from Argentina and Brazil form a monophylum and that this species is a representative of the genus Pseudolycoriella ( ). The nearest-neighbor species to Psl. hygida in our analysis was Psl. bruckii (Winnertz, 1867), with an interspecific distance of 16.64% (Table S1).\n\nMolecular data for Psl. hygida (partly published under the names ‘Bradysia hygida’ or ‘Sciaridae sp.’) are deposited in BOLD Systems and GenBank as follows:\n\nCOI barcodes: BIN ID BOLD:ACW7953 [125], and this study.\n\nRibosomal RNA: 5S, GenBank accession number {\"type\":\"entrez-nucleotide\",\"attrs\":{\"text\":\"AY224134\",\"term_id\":\"29169791\",\"term_text\":\"AY224134\"}}AY224134 [99]; 18S, GenBank accession number {\"type\":\"entrez-nucleotide\",\"attrs\":{\"text\":\"JQ652461\",\"term_id\":\"387165383\",\"term_text\":\"JQ652461\"}}JQ652461 [50]; 28S, GenBank accession number {\"type\":\"entrez-nucleotide\",\"attrs\":{\"text\":\"JQ652462\",\"term_id\":\"387165384\",\"term_text\":\"JQ652462\"}}JQ652462 [50].\n\nMitogenome: GenBank accession number {\"type\":\"entrez-nucleotide\",\"attrs\":{\"text\":\"MW442371\",\"term_id\":\"2182488974\",\"term_text\":\"MW442371\"}}MW442371 [39].\n\nGenome assembly: GenBank accession number {\"type\":\"entrez-nucleotide\",\"attrs\":{\"text\":\"WJQU00000000\",\"term_id\":\"2457853398\",\"term_text\":\"WJQU00000000\"}}WJQU00000000, BioSample SAMN12911131 [26].\n\n3.7. Cytogenetics\n\nThe polytene chromosome complement of Psl. hygida follows the pattern documented for other sciarid species that have been cytogenetically studied: there are three autosomal chromosomes named A, B, and C according to Metz [126] or IV, III, and II, respectively, according to Crouse and Smith-Stocking [127], in addition to the X chromosome ( ). The latter is a pair in the female soma while it is only single in the male soma [35,36]. Such a general feature of all of the sciarid flies allows the identification of the male polytene X chromosome as it stains weaker than the female polytene X that originates from two chromatids instead of one. Polytene chromosome maps of Psl. hygida, although constructed half a century ago, are shown for the first time in this report ( ) and have since been useful for the identification of Nucleolar Organizer Regions (NORs) and DNA and RNA puffs in addition to other transcriptionally active sites that do not develop large puffs (reviewed in [18,20]).\n\nExcept for Hybosciara fragilis (Morgante, 1969), which has never been recollected since the 1960s, sciarid flies that have been exploited in cytogenetics and/or molecular biology are restricted to six genera, namely Bradysia [49,128], Rhynchosciara [21,46,47], Lycoriella [48], Pseudolycoriella [26,39], Pseudosciara [45,46], and Schwenckfeldina [21,46]. With the aim of finding clues regarding whether and how chromosome complements of sciarids are conserved or diverge during genus evolution, we compared representatives of these genera using data available in the literature. Their basic chromosomal features, such as the localization of centromeres and NORs, are shown schematically ( ).\n\nThree conserved chromosome marks emerge from . All included species display a single NOR within each chromosome complement that is always close to the centromere. In addition, in the studied species the large autosome (A or IV) is always metacentric or sub-metacentric ( ). Three sub-groups can be formed based on NOR location: in Pseudosciara and Lycoriella, it is located in the metacentric or sub-metacentric X chromosome; in Rhynchosciara and Bradysia, it is located sub-telocentrically in chromosome X; and in Schwenckfeldina and Pseudolycoriella, the NOR is sub-telocentric in the shortest autosome (chromosome C or II).\n\n4. Discussion\n\n4.1. Breeding of Pseudolycoriella hygida and Morphology of Immature Stages\n\nPseudolycoriella hygida larvae are maintained on a diet of partially decomposed Ilex paraguariensis leaves, but it remains to be determined if they feed exclusively on decomposing vegetable matter or also on the associated fungi and/or microorganisms that participate in the decomposition process. Pseudolycoriella hygida larvae are gregarious, and during the larval stage they migrate towards the fresher food. Nevertheless, the larvae will continue to feed on older food until it turns into slurry if fresher food is not added to the culture. Attempts to feed Psl. hygida larvae on living plants were not successful, whereas larvae fed solely on white mushrooms (Agaricus bisporus) did not show alterations in the life cycle (Marques and Monesi, unpublished observations). Different sciarid species can use different food sources [5,130], and even though the feeding behavior under laboratory conditions may differ from that which occurs in nature, we propose that further studies should be carried out on Psl. hygida to better understand larval feeding habits and behavior in the very species-rich and widespread genus Pseudolycoriella.\n\nA laboratory culture is a valuable resource in the study of different traits of an insect species, such as the life cycle, development, feeding habits, and molecular mechanisms. Sciarid larvae found in the field are difficult to associate with adults, and the larvae and pupae of relatively few species have been described. Menzel and Mohrig [61] pointed out that preimaginal stages of less than 40 sciarid representatives have been described morphologically so far. Most of these are black fungus gnats that have drawn attention either as pests or because they undertake large larval migrations, a natural phenomenon popularly called ‘armyworm’ or ‘snakeworm’ [61].\n\nGeneral morphology, terminology, and illustrations can be found mainly in [6,61,70,131,132,133,134,135,136,137]. The presence of a genal foramen, the membranous medial area ventrally, seems to be a derived feature shared by all sciarids—also seen, for example, in Corynoptera [134] and Scythropochroa [136], although with some variation in shape and size. A medial sclerotized projection of the clypeus, also seen in Scythropochroa [136], is a derived feature probably not universally present in sciarids.\n\nPseudolycoriella hygida larvae build individual cocoons, which is similar to most other sciarid species [102,138] but differs from some Rhynchosciara species, which build communal cocoons [102,118]. Descriptions of Psl. hygida adult external morphology [25], embryonic development [43], and the pattern of larval eyespot formation at the end of the fourth larval stage [34] have previously been published. The redescription of Psl. hygida adults and the description of the immature stages complete the characterization of all developmental stages of this sciarid species and constitute an important resource for future studies on this unconventional model organism.\n\n4.2. Unknown DNA Sequences in Pseudolycoriella: A Challenge in Phylogenetic Systematics\n\nThe COI analysis of 57 sciarid species showed that Psl. hygida appearing as sister species of Psl. nodulosa + Psl. bruckii ( ) and the nearest neighbor species could be Psl. bruckii (Winnertz, 1867), with an interspecific distance of 16.64% (Table S1). Both the large genetic distance and the Palaearctic distribution of Psl. bruckii, which is restricted to Europe, indicate the weak points of the ML tree presented in . (A) COI sequences alone are generally not suitable for inferring phylogenetically closely related sister species. (B) Our analysis considers only 44 of 161 Pseudolycoriella species whose COI barcodes are known (27.3%). In contrast, 72.7% of all described Pseudolycoriella species have not yet been genetically analyzed, particularly the species from the tropical and subtropical regions of Central and South America, Africa, and Southeast Asia. (C) Genetic data on ribosomal genes (especially 16S, 18S, 28S) are currently only available for 21.1% of known Pseudolycoriella species. Such rDNA sequences have so far only been published for 34 validly described species from Korea (1), Brazil (1), and New Zealand (32) [3,5,50], which makes a well-founded molecular phylogenetic analysis of all described Pseudolycoriella impossible at present. For these reasons, the phylogenetic relationships will not be further discussed. On the other hand, a comparison of Psl. hygida with morphologically similar Pseudolycoriella species discussed in Section 3.5 revealed that it is closely related to Psl. coecoalata Mohrig, 2003 from Central America, for which no molecular data are yet available. For the reasons mentioned above, the results presented make an important contribution to the molecular phylogeny of this megadiverse and globally distributed genus. They prove morphologically and genetically that Psl. hygida belongs to Pseudolycoriella and that the species is more widespread in the Neotropical realm than previously assumed.\n\n4.3. Pseudolycoriella hygida as a Model Organism in Cytogenetics\n\nHistorically, Psl. hygida was the third sciarid species for which polytene chromosome maps were constructed [40] after those of Bradysia tilicola (as Sciara coprophila) [139] and Rh. americana [140]. Together with the maps of Pss. pubescens (as Trichosia) [141], Psl. hygida is the fourth sciarid species for which polytene maps are available in the literature. Chromosome maps are a valuable tool in studies focusing on cytogenetic or molecular traits of species. Their preparation is time-consuming, but the finished map contains a detailed, graphical representation of chromosomes in a given developmental period. The accuracy of polytene maps depends primarily on the chromosome quality in terms of cytological resolution. In this sense, sciarid larvae usually provide polytene chromosomes of very good quality, which are not always present in the salivary gland cells of other dipterans. In some cases, polytene chromosome spreads are below the minimum standard required for image documentation and subsequent map production.\n\nGene amplification, visualized cytologically in the form of DNA puffs in polytene chromosomes, seems to be common to all the sciarid species that have been studied to date. Although information on the phenomenon is lacking for Schwenckfeldina sp., the species included in the present study is also likely to develop DNA puffs, as do other sciarid representatives. In contrast, with regard to gene amplification and RNA expression, Psl. hygida is one of the most well-studied organisms.\n\nA comparison of chromosome complements showed that the largest autosome (chromosome A/IV) appeared invariably metacentric/sub-metacentric, while other autosomes and also chromosome X may vary from sub-metacentric to sub-telocentric. The sub-telocentric assumption comes from Bradysia tilicola (= coprophila), the only species that has been analyzed molecularly in relation to centromere location. Use of specific probes showed that centromere sequences do not reach the very end of chromosome X [49]. Whether other sciarid chromosomes are in fact telocentric remains to be investigated. The conservation of the centromere position observed for the largest autosome is worthy of note, as this mark is shared by distinct genera, i.e., organisms evolutionarily distant albeit belonging to the same dipteran family.\n\nAnother conserved characteristic displayed by the sciarid complements involves the NORs, with only one per chromosome complement. Its location in the X chromosome was for a long time considered invariable until the first studies on the subject were carried out on Psl. hygida. This species was the first sciarid to have the NOR localized in the chromosome C/II, namely the shortest autosome [36,50]. Years later, an identical NOR location was detected in Schwenckfeldina sp. [21]. The evolutionary transfer of the sciarid NOR from the X chromosome to the autosome implies a change in the expression of ribosomal genes, because the two NORs in the autosome pair make dispensable the mechanism of dosage compensation required in sciarid genomes where NORs are on the X chromosome [142].\n\nThe comparison of chromosome complements of the species available for analysis supports chromosome evolution unrelated to sciarid phylogeny [5]. It is important to note that given the number of sciarid genera and species in nature, this study is obviously unable to provide a reliable measure of chromosomal features in Sciaridae in relation to either conservation or divergence.\n\n4.4. Sciarid Names Used in Cytogenetics and Molecular Studies: Towards an Integrative Approach to Clarifying Scientific Problems\n\nGenetic research on Sciaridae was initiated in the mid-1920s by Charles W. Metz (1889–1975) in the United States, who initially conducted studies on chromosomal behavior and sex determination on Sciara coprophila, S. pauciseta, and S. similans [143,144]. Subsequently, chromosome research was extended to other sciarid species, for which laboratory cultures were established mainly in the United States and Brazil. So far, the following twenty-one sciarid species names have been used to describe study objects in cytogenetics: americana Wiedemann, angelae Nonato & Pavan, baschanti Breuer, coprophila Lintner, elegans Morgante, fagilis Morgante, hollaenderi Toledo Filho, hygida Sauaia & Alves, impatiens Johannsen, milleri Pavan & Breuer, ocellaris Comstock, odoriphaga Yang & Zhang, tritici Coquillett, pauciseta Felt, prolifica Felt, pubescens Morgante, reynoldsi Metz, similans Johannsen, spatitergum Hardy, subtrivialis Pettey, and varians Johannsen.\n\nMany of the above names were used unchanged in cytogenetic publications over a period of almost 100 years, regardless of the nomenclatural innovations and corrections in the classification of Sciaridae.\n\nOnly the names Hybosciara fragilis Morgante, 1969, Rhynchosciara americana (Wiedemann, 1821), Rhynchosciara baschanti Breuer, 1967, Rhynchosciara hollaenderi Toledo Filho, 1969, and Rhynchosciara milleri Pavan & Breuer, 1955 are correct and consistent, because their position in the system of sciarids has not changed over a long period, nor were they shown to be junior synonyms of sciarid taxa described earlier. The type material of Bradysia elegans Morgante, 1969 is still unrevised. Similarly to what happened with Psl. hygida, the reexamination of the type series of B. elegans may show it to be a species of Pseudolycoriella. The remaining taxa belong to thirteen species with the following nomenclatural history (valid species names in bold):\n\nBradysia cellarum Frey, 1948. Used in cytogenetics as Bradysia odoriphaga; B. odoriphaga Yang & Zhang, 1985 synonymized by Ye et al. [145]: 183.\n\nBradysia impatiens (Johannsen, 1912). Used in cytogenetics as Sciara impatiens or Bradysia impatiens; first mentioned as Bradysia in Roberts and Lavigne [146]: 25, based on Shaw [147]: 29, 30.\n\nBradysia ocellaris (Comstock, 1882). Used in cytogenetics as Sciara ocellaris, Sciara reynoldsi, Sciara tritici, Bradysia ocellaris, or Bradysia tritici; S. ocellaris combined in the genus Bradysia by Tuomikoski [148]: 133; S. reynoldsi Metz, 1938 synonymized by Mohrig et al. [7]: 166; S. tritici Coquillett, 1895 synonymized by Steffan [149]: 290, with important comments on the type material and nomenclature in Menzel and Mohrig [61]: 155, and Mohrig et al. [7]: 168.\n\nBradysia pallipes (Fabricius, 1787). Used in cytogenetics as Sciara prolifica; S. prolifica Felt, 1897 synonymized by Mohrig et al. [7]: 168.\n\nBradysia radicum (Brunetti, 1912). Used in cytogenetics as Bradysia spatitergum; B. spatitergum (Hardy, 1956) synonymized by Mohrig et al. [74]: 410.\n\nBradysia tilicola (Loew, 1850). Used in cytogenetics as Sciara coprophila or Bradysia coprophila; S. coprophila Lintner, 1895 synonymized by Menzel and Mohrig [61]: 148, Menzel and Heller [150]: 231.\n\nBradysia varians (Johannsen, 1912). Used in cytogenetics as Sciara varians; first mention as Bradysia in Stone and Laffoon [151]: 234.\n\nCorynoptera subtrivialis (Pettey, 1918). Used in cytogenetics as Sciara subtrivialis; S. subtrivialis combined in the genus Corynoptera by Steffan [134]: 49.\n\nLycoriella ingenua (Dufour, 1839). Used in cytogenetics as Sciara pauciseta; S. pauciseta Felt, 1897 synonymized by Steffan [149]: 290, Menzel and Mohrig [61]: 394.\n\nLycoriella sativae (Johannsen, 1912). Used in cytogenetics as Sciara similans; S. similans Johannsen, 1925 synonymized by Mohrig et al. [7]: 216.\n\nPseudolycoriella hygida (Sauaia & Alves, 1968). Used in cytogenetics as Bradysia hygida; B. hygida combined in the genus Pseudolycoriella by Trinca et al. [26]: 21.\n\nPseudosciara pubescens (Morgante, 1969). Used in cytogenetics as Trichosia sp., Trichosia pubescens, or Trichomegalosphys pubescens; T. pubescens combined in the genus Pseudosciara by Mohrig and Menzel [8]: 175.\n\nRhynchosciara americana (Wiedemann, 1821). Used in cytogenetics as Rhynchosciara americana and/or Rhynchosciara angelae; Rh. angelae Nonato & Pavan, 1951 synonymized by Breuer [152]: 172.\n\nIn addition, Brito da Cunha et al. mention a ‘Bradysia mogiensis’ in their papers [153,154] that is not included in the catalogue of Neotropical Sciaridae [82]; no valid species description has been found in the literature for this Bradysia name. It is said to date back to a publication by the same author [155], in which only a not-further-identified ‘Bradysia sp.’ was discussed. Therefore, ‘Bradysia mogiensis’ is formally a nomen nudum and cannot be used without valid description.\n\nThe nomenclatural history of the validated sciarid species does not include a single species that represents the genus Sciara Meigen. The cytogenetically analyzed species either belong to other genera or have been given synonymous or invalid names. On the other hand, the inconsistent naming of cytogenetic study objects leads to problems in interdisciplinary research, because after the introduction of genetic analysis methods in phylogenetic systematics, the same reference databases are used by geneticists and taxonomists alike (e.g., BOLD, GenBank). Gene sequences that should be allocated to the same species have been deposited with different species and genus names. Consequently, the inconsistent use of sciarid names has meant that existing datasets are often not recognized or only recognized with difficulty and are therefore either not taken into account in subsequent studies or discussed in the wrong context. For the reasons mentioned above, the correct naming of species used is indispensable and an essential prerequisite for the well-founded comparison of genetic data. This highlights the fact that contemporary scientific problems, such as nomenclatural barriers, can usually only be overcome through the integrated efforts of experts from different research disciplines.\n\nAcknowledgments\n\nWe thank Maria Isabel P.A.
