Rescue workers are in contact with the woman and were hoping to extract her before the end of the day.\n\nThe tragedy occurred late on Tuesday evening when one floor of the multi-storey hotel collapsed with 14 people inside.\n\nTwo people were killed. One was a woman born in 1961, whose body was found later in the afternoon on Wednesday, while another man's body has not yet been recovered from the rubble.\n\nFive were able to escape the site immediately, but seven people were trapped in the building overnight, six of whom were rescued over the course of Wednesday.\n\nAmong those rescued were a 2-year-old boy, his mother and his father, who suffered severe injuries.\n\nPictures from the scene show parts of the building had collapsed, with concrete debris on the ground.\n\nPublic broadcaster SWR reported that the fire brigade was initially unable to enter the building due to the risk of further collapse. Neighbouring buildings were also evacuated.\n\nInvestigations were under way to establish why the hotel collapsed. Local authorities said the structure of the building probably dates back to the 17th century, while construction work was also being done on the hotel on Tuesday."
