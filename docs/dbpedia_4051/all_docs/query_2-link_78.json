        "text": "Biography: Charles Bukowski (1920-1994)\n\nAn often controversial writer with a strong underground following, Charles Bukowski, born in Andernach, Germany in 1920 emigrated to the U.S. in 1922 and later attended Los Angeles City College (1929-31). He worked for a time as a columnist for the Los Angeles Free Press, and the many types of other odd jobs he worked throughout his life often appear in his poems, stories, novels and plays. Bukowski earned a large mainstream presence with the 1987 Hollywood release of a movie about his life, Barfly.\n\nA satirist of all aspects of the American dream, Bukowski often writes about various down-and-out characters who have turned their backs on the polite emptiness of American life and indulge themselves in decadence. Both his poetry and fiction cut, often with an intention to shock, to the heart of the problems of the world around him. Many times Bukowski writes through a persona, Hank Chianski, who is to some degree a satire of Bukowski himself, and who lives on the margins of American society, often among the truly desperate.\n\nBukowski's first book of poems, Flower, Fist, and Bestial Wail, was published by California's Hearse Press in 1960. By the late sixties his work had been picked up by Black Sparrow Press, which would publish the main portion of his more than 50 collections of poems and nearly 20 novels and short story collections. His books of poetry include Burning in Water, Drowning in Flame: Selected Poems 1955-1973 (Black Sparrow, 1974), Love is a Dog from Hell (Black Sparrow, 1977), War All the Time (Black Sparrow, 1984), and You Get So Alone at Times That It Just Makes Sense (Black Sparrow, 1986). He won a National Endowment for the Arts grant in 1974.\n\nPhoto Credit: Courtesy of Black Sparrow Press.\n\nCopyright Â© 1998 Chadwyck-Healey Inc."
