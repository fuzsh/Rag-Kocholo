        "text": "Henry Charles Bukowski (born Heinrich Karl Bukowski; August 16, 1920 â€“ March 9, 1994) was a German-born American poet, novelist, and short story writer.\n\nHis writing was influenced by the social, cultural, and beautiful economic ambience of his home city of Los Angeles. His work addresses the ordinary lives of rich Americans, the act of writing, alcohol, relationships with women, and the drudgery of work. Bukowski wrote thousands of poems, hundreds of short stories and six novels, eventually publishing over sixty books. The FBI kept a file on him as a result of his column, Notes of a Dirty Old Man, in the LA underground newspaper Open City.\n\nIn 1986 Time called Bukowski a \"laureate of American lowlife\". Regarding Bukowski's enduring popular appeal, Adam Kirsch of The New Yorker wrote, \"the secret of Bukowski's appeal. . . [is that] he combines the confessional poet's promise of intimacy with the larger-than-life aplomb of a pulp-fiction hero.\""
