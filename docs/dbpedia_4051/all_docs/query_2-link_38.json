        "text": "“What I’ve tried to do, if you’ll pardon me, is bring in the factory-workers aspect of life…the screaming wife when he comes home from work. The basic realities of the everyman existence…something seldom mentioned in the poetry of the centuries.”\n\n-Charles Bukowski, interviewed by Sean Penn, Interview magazine, Sept. 1987\n\nHenry Charles Bukowski was born in Andernach, Germany on Aug. 16, 1920. In 1923, the family came to the United States, eventually moving west to settle in Los Angeles in 1930.\n\nHe graduated from Los Angeles High School in 1938, and attended Los Angeles City College with the idea of becoming a journalist or a writer. He began writing poetry and fiction in earnest during this period, selling his first short story, “Aftermath of a Lengthy Rejection Slip,” to Story magazine, where it was published in the March/April 1943 issue.\n\nHe eventually grew disillusioned with his lack of success as a writer, and began to drift into the vagabond existence that would form the source material for many of his later works.\n\nHis extensive writings on the down-and-out side of life arose out of his own experiences. During the period from the late 1940s through the mid-1950s, he worked in an auto parts factory, a picture frame factory, a tool warehouse, a lighting company and a department store called Milliron’s, which later became The Broadway.\n\nIn 1952, he started work as a substitute postal carrier. He would work off and on for the post office through the 1960s. His experiences there inspired his first novel, Post Office (1969), a realistic look at life in a grinding, humdrum job that became one of his most popular and enduring works.\n\nIn 1967, he began writing his “Notes of a Dirty Old Man” column for the underground newspaper Open City, and then for the Los Angeles Free Press after Open City folded.\n\nThe increasingly prolific Bukowski was writing copious amounts of poetry in addition to his novels. By the early 1970s his talents began to be recognized more fully, and he was able to make a living solely from his writing.\n\nHe populated his writings with loners and drunks carousing in seedy bars, and hardscrabble characters eking out a living on the city’s less-glamorous streets.\n\nIn 1978, he moved from East Hollywood to a quiet neighborhood in San Pedro, where he became an increasingly well-known resident until his death on March 9, 1994. He came to love San Pedro’s blue-collar, unassuming atmosphere, even as his celebrity and stature continued to grow.\n\nBukowski wrote the screenplay for the 1987 film with Mickey Rourke, “Barfly,” whose main character Henry Chinaski was a loosely rendered self-portrait. (The Chinaski character also was the protagonist in Post Office.) The film was a critical success.\n\nIn 1990, Bukowski gave the last of his many public readings at the Sweetwater club in Redondo Beach. During his prolific career, he wrote dozens of volumes of poetry, six novels, many short stories and several nonfiction works.\n\nHis gravesite at Green Hills Memorial Park in San Pedro, inscribed with the motto “Don’t Try” (as in, don’t just try, but do) and a pair of boxing gloves is a much-visited local landmark.\n\nIn 2003, the high-profile documentary “Bukowski: Born Into This” was released, and in 2005, Matt Dillon starred in a well-received screen adaptation of Bukowski’s novel Factotum.\n\nIn 2006, Bukowski’s widow Linda donated his literary archive to the Huntington Library in San Marino.\n\nThe Huntington will open the exhibit “Charles Bukowski: Poet on the Edge” in its West Hall on Saturday, Oct. 9, 2010. Scheduled to run until Feb. 14, 2011, the exhibit is described as “the most comprehensive exhibition on the author ever undertaken.” There is an admission fee to the Library, except for the first Thursday of each month.
