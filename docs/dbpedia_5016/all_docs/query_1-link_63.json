        "text": "What is PRAM?\n\nPRAM, which stands for Parameter Random Access Memory, is a type of memory used in some Mac computers that stores key system settings and preferences, such as time and date, volume, and startup disk selection.\n\nUnlike RAM (Random Access Memory), which is volatile and loses stored data when you shut down your computer, PRAM is non-volatile, so it doesn’t clear its data when you turn off your computer. This preserves system settings between sessions, even if the computer is unplugged or experiences a power outage.\n\nPRAM works by using a small amount of battery power to maintain the stored settings. When the computer is powered off, the PRAM continues to draw power from the battery, which lets it retain its data.\n\nIn some newer Macs, PRAM has been replaced by NVRAM (Non-Volatile Random Access Memory), which also stores system settings and preferences. NVRAM does not require a battery to retain its data, but it may occasionally need to be reset to resolve issues related to booting or network connectivity.\n\nWhen should you reset PRAM?\n\nProblems with your PRAM and NVRAM can result in user settings being lost, causing issues like connectivity problems and resolution changes. If you notice a change in how your Mac’s battery meter, clocks, lights, ports, or power button function, the culprit could be your PRAM.\n\nCommon problems that could be caused by PRAM include:\n\nIncorrect display resolution\n\nUnexpected volume or sound behavior\n\nIncorrect date, time, or time zone data\n\nErratic mouse scrolling and clicking behavior\n\nUnusual keyboard responses\n\nA question mark appears when you start up your Mac\n\nBut not all Mac problems are caused by PRAM. That’s why it’s important to regularly practice basic digital hygiene. Cleaning out your Mac’s other storage and using Mac cleaning software to remove unwanted clutter and bloatware can help speed up your Mac and keep it in good shape.\n\nIf PRAM is indeed the reason that your computer is acting oddly, you should be able to solve the issue with a PRAM reset.\n\nPRAM issues can result in various user settings being lost.\n\nIs it safe to reset PRAM?\n\nIt is safe to reset your PRAM or NVRAM, but keep in mind that many system features will default to their original factory settings. You should also back up important data before you reset your Mac.\n\nAfter a reset, settings such as time, keyboard layout, display resolution, and volume may restore to default — you might need to change them back if you had your own custom settings.\n\nHow to reset PRAM or NVRAM on a Mac\n\nResetting a Mac’s PRAM is a simple process. These steps apply to all Macs, including MacBook Pro, MacBook Air, and iMac devices. We’ll also show you how to reset PRAM or NVRAM if your Mac has a newer type of memory.\n\nHow to reset PRAM\n\nHere’s how to reset PRAM on a Mac:\n\nShut down your Mac and disconnect any USB devices except for wired keyboards.\n\nPress the power button to turn on your Mac.\n\nImmediately press and hold Option, Command, P, and R.\n\nHold these keys down until you hear the startup sound twice. On Macs without a startup sound, you will see the Apple logo appear and disappear twice.\n\nRelease the keys and let your Mac continue to start up as usual.\n\nHow to reset NVRAM\n\nResetting NVRAM is the same process as resetting PRAM. Here’s how to reset NVRAM on a Mac:\n\nShut down your Mac.\n\nPress the power button to turn on your Mac.\n\nImmediately press and hold Option, Command, P, and R.\n\nHold these keys down until you hear the startup sound twice. On Macs without a startup sound, you will see the Apple logo appear and disappear twice.\n\nRelease the keys and let your Mac continue to start up as usual.\n\nWhat is SMC?\n\nSMC (System Management Controller) is a type of memory used in Macs. While PRAM and the SMC are both types of memory, they serve different purposes.\n\nThe SMC manages hardware-related functions such as cooling fans, battery charging, and keyboard backlighting. Problems with these parts of the computer can sometimes be solved by an SMC reset.\n\nThe SMC is only present in Intel-based Macs. In Macs with an Apple silicon processor, such as those with an M1 or M2 chip, the functions that the SMC used to perform are handled by the chip itself.\n\nCommon SMC issues\n\nResetting the SMC (System Management Controller) on a Mac can help resolve a variety of hardware-related issues.\n\nHere are some common issues that could be resolved by resetting the SMC:\n\nThe Mac won't turn on or it turns off without warning.\n\nThe battery is not charging or doesn't hold a charge for as long as it used to.\n\nThe fans are louder than normal or running at high speed.\n\nYour Mac is overheating.\n\nThe keyboard backlight is malfunctioning.\n\nThe display flickers or doesn’t go on correctly.\n\nThe trackpad is not functioning normally.\n\nIt experiences other power-related issues.\n\nSome issues related to Mac performance may not be resolved by resetting the SMC. In that case, you may need to clean up your computer more generally — delete unnecessary files, uninstall unused applications, free up disk space, etc. AVG TuneUp for Mac is specialized optimization software that will take care of these tasks automatically and get your Mac running smoothly in no time.\n\nHow to reset the SMC on a Mac\n\nThe process for resetting the SMC varies slightly depending on your Mac model. In this section, we’ll explain how to reset your SMC on Intel-based Macs.\n\nMacs based on the newer Apple silicon M1 and M2 processors don’t have an SMC, as these functions are performed by the chip itself. Some users have found that turning off their M1 or M2 Mac and waiting for 30 seconds before restarting produces similar effects to an SMC reset.\n\nOn post-2018 MacBooks, MacBook Pros, and MacBook Airs\n\nBefore resetting the SMC on any MacBook, MacBook Pro, or MacBook Air, check whether your Mac model has the Apple T2 Security Chip. These chips are in MacBooks, MacBook Pros, and MacBook Air models from 2018 or later.\n\nHere’s how to reset the SMC on any Mac laptop model with the Apple T2 Security Chip:\n\nShut down your MacBook.\n\nPress and hold the power button for 10 seconds, then let go of the button.\n\nWait a few seconds and restart your Mac.\n\nIf that doesn’t fix the issue, shut down your Mac again.\n\nPress the right Shift key, the left Option key, and the left Control key and hold for seven seconds. Then, press and hold the power button along with the other three keys.\n\nKeep holding down all four keys for another seven seconds. If your Mac has turned on, it will turn off again as you hold down these keys.\n\nLet go of the keys and wait a few more seconds. Then, restart your Mac.\n\nOn pre-2018 MacBooks, MacBook Pros, and MacBook Airs\n\nFor older Macs that don’t have an Apple T2 Security Chip, the process to reset the SMC is different. Whether the Mac in question has a removable or non-removable battery also affects the process.\n\nFor example, to reset the SMC on a MacBook which has a removable battery, you don’t have to hold a key combination. That’s because these laptops reset the SMC by performing a power cycle. Power cycling turns off the Mac’s power and forces it to restart.\n\nHow to reset the SMC on a pre-2018 MacBook with a non-removable battery\n\nShut down your MacBook.\n\nConnect the power adapter to your MacBook.\n\nOn the keyboard, press and hold the left Shift, Control, and Option keys, as well as the power button, for 10 seconds.\n\nRelease all three keys and the power button, then press the power button again to turn on your MacBook.\n\nHow to reset the SMC on a Mac with a removable battery\n\nShut down your Mac.\n\nRemove the battery.\n\nPress and hold the power button for five seconds.\n\nPut the battery back in and switch your MacBook back on again.\n\nOn iMac, Mac Mini, or Mac Pro\n\nResetting SMC on a desktop Mac also depends on whether your Mac has an Apple T2 Security Chip.\n\nHow to reset the SMC on a desktop Mac with an Apple T2 Security Chip\n\nShut down your Mac.\n\nPress and hold the power button for 10 seconds, then release it.\n\nWait a few seconds, then restart your Mac.\n\nIf that doesn’t solve the issue, shut down your Mac again.\n\nUnplug the power cable and wait 15 seconds.\n\nReconnect the power cable and wait 5 seconds.\n\nHow to reset the SMC on a pre-2018 desktop Mac\n\nShut down your Mac.\n\nUnplug the power cable and wait 15 seconds.\n\nReconnect the power cable and wait 5 seconds.\n\nPress the power button to turn on your Mac.\n\nKeep your Apple device healthy with AVG TuneUp for Mac\n\nIf you're looking to keep your Mac running smoothly, AVG TuneUp is an easy way to remove clutter and boost performance.
