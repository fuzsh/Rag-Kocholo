        "text": "The COVID-19 pandemic has exposed the complex interdependencies of globalized supply chains. While these global multistage production networks had spread during a relatively benign environment of falling trade barriers and increasing interdependencies among countries, a series of shocks over the last decade and the current crisis argue for a reassessment. Managers should consider regionalization, more robust second sourcing, and rethink scale and product mix as they work to ensure more resilience in the future.\n\n(Most popular article of 2020, MIT Sloan Management Review)\n\nHarvard Business Review\n\nThe COVID-19 pandemic exposed the vulnerabilities in the production strategies and supply chains of firms everywhere. Coupled with a rise in economic nationalism, manufacturers everywhere are going to be under pressure to rethink their sourcing and logistics strategies. They need to analyze their risk exposures, and then think about how to improve their resilience. They should look beyond just relocating supply, towards harnessing process innovations and revisiting some of the trade-offs between product variety and flexibility.\n\nWhy have things been such a mess? For starters, there are a lot more layers than you probably imagine.\n\nDespite the current turmoil, memories will fade, and economics will trump concerns about national vulnerabilities.\n\nby Gary P. Pisano and Willy C. Shih, Harvard Business Review, JulyAugust 2009\n\nFor decades, U.S. companies have been outsourcing manufacturing in the belief that it held no competitive advantage. That’s been a disaster, maintain Harvard professors Pisano and Shih, because today’s low-value manufacturing operations hold the seeds of tomorrow’s innovative new products.\n\nWhat those companies have been ceding is the country’s industrial commons—that is, the collective operational capabilities that underpin new product and process development in the U.S. industrial sector. As a result, America has lost not only the ability to develop and manufacture high-tech products like televisions, memory chips, and laptops but also the expertise to produce emerging hot products like the Kindle e-reader, high-end servers, solar panels, and the batteries that will power the next generation of automobiles.\n\nTo rebuild the commons and restore its wealth-generating machine will require government and industry in the United States to make two drastic changes. Read the full article\n\nby Gary Pisano and Willy C. Shih\n\nCompanies compete on the decisions they make. For years—even decades—in response to intensifying global competition, companies decided to outsource their manufacturing operations in order to reduce costs. But we are now seeing the alarming long-term effect of those choices: in many cases, once manufacturing capabilities go away, so does much of the ability to innovate and compete. Manufacturing, it turns out, really matters in an innovation-driven economy.\n\nIn Producing Prosperity, Harvard Business School professors Gary Pisano and Willy Shih show the disastrous consequences of years of poor sourcing decisions and underinvestment in manufacturing capabilities. They reveal how today’s undervalued manufacturing operations often hold the seeds of tomorrow’s innovative new products, arguing that companies must reinvest in new product and process development in the US industrial sector. Only by reviving this “industrial commons” can the world’s largest economy build the expertise and manufacturing muscle to regain competitive advantage. America needs a manufacturing renaissance—for restoring itself, and for the global economy as a whole.\n\nThis will require major changes. Pisano and Shih show how company-level choices are key to the sustained success of industries and economies, and they provide business leaders with a framework for understanding the links between manufacturing and innovation that will enable them to make better outsourcing decisions. They also detail how government must change its support of basic and applied scientific research, and promote collaboration between business and academia.\n\nFor executives, policymakers, academics, and innovators alike, Producing Prosperity provides the clearest and most compelling account yet of how the American economy lost its competitive edge—and how to get it back.\n\nWilly C.
