        "text": "2023 – NVIDIA became the first chipmaker to ever reach a market capitalization of $1 trillion. Mostly, these gains have accumulated during the last decade, when the company’s stock has surged by roughly 10,870%. Yet in fiscal 2023, NVIDIA’s revenue stayed flat, and its adjusted EPS dropped 55%.\n\n2022 – The parent company of Arm Holding, SoftBank, and NVIDIA said that they would not move forward with the transaction due to regulatory challenges. In 2022, as it did in 2021, NVIDIA experienced a major growth jump as the pandemic forced more consumers to buy new PCs for online classes, remote work, and high-end video games. More data center operators also had to upgrade their services with NVIDIA’s GPUs.\n\n2021 – The intended takeover of the British company Arm Holdings was suspended because the UK’s Competition and Markets Authority had spoken about competition concerns. Later the same year, a competition investigation into the takeover was opened.\n\n2020 – NVIDIA’s scientists developed an open-source ventilator to compensate for the shortage caused by the pandemic. Later in the year, the company announced its Ampere GPU microarchitecture and the Nvidia A 100 GPU accelerator.\n\n2019 – NVIDIA announced new RTX Studio laptops, which promised to be seven times faster than a top-end MacBook Pro with a Core i9 and AMD’s Radeon Pro Vega 20 graphics in apps like Maya and RedCine-X Pro. In August, the company announced Minecraft RTX, with an added real-time DXR raytracing tailored to the Windows 10 version of the game.\n\n2018 – The company released the Nvidia Quadro GV100 on March 27 and the RTX 2080 GPUs on September 27. The same year, Google announced that Nvidia’s Tesla P4 graphic cards would be integrated into Google Cloud service’s artificial intelligence.\n\n2017 – NVIDIA released the Titan V on December 7.\n\n2016 – NVIDIA presented the first GPUs of the GeForce 10 series, the GTX 1080 and 1070, based on the company’s new Pascal microarchitecture.\n\n2013 – The Tegra 4 and the Nvidia Shield, an Android-based handheld game console, were unveiled to the public. The company announced that it bought PGI from STMicroelectronics.\n\n2011 – NVIDIA released its Tegra 3 ARM system-on-a-chip for mobile devices. It featured the world’s first world quad-core mobile CPU. The same year, the company announced that it would acquire Icera, a baseband chip-making company in the United Kingdom, for $367 million.\n\n2008 – The company acquired Ageia, developer of the PhysX physics engine and physics processing unit.\n\n2007 – NVIDIA was named the Company of the Year by Forbes magazine for its rapid growth and success.\n\n2004 – NVIDIA announced that it would assist Sony with the design of the graphics processor (RSX) in the PlayStation 3 game console.\n\n2002-2003 – These were years of successful acquisitions. In July 2002, NVIDIA acquired Exluna which made software-rendering tools. In August 2003, NVIDIA bought iReady, a provider of high-performance TCP/IP and iSCSI offload solutions.\n\n2001 – This was the year of noticeably growing revenue for the company. NVIDIA earned $1.37 billion and thus nearly doubled the revenue of the previous year. Its net income jumped to $176.9 million, while its stock price climbed to $66.90 at the end of the year from $16.50 at its beginning. In December, NVIDIA replaced Enron Corporation on the S&P 500.\n\n2000 – NVIDIA split its stock for the first time. Since 2020, NVIDIA’s stock split history has continued, as it split its stock also in 2001, 2006, 2007, and 2021. An investor who bought 100 shares of NVDA stock in the 1999 IPO would now own 4,800 shares of NVIDIA thanks to all the share splits along the way.\n\n1999 – The company released the GeForce 256 (NV10), thus introducing onboard transformation and lightning to consumer-level 3D hardware. The GeForce 256 implemented video acceleration, motion compensation, and hardware sub-picture alpha blending and left all existing products spectacularly behind. Among other products created the same year was Aladdin TNT2 for PCs, which cost less than $1,000. In 1999, NVIDIA went public.\n\n1998 – NVIDIA released the RIVA TNT, which boosted its reputation for developing effective graphic adapters.\n\n1997 – This proved to be a memorable year for NVIDIA. After launching the RIVA series of graphic processors, it became a force to be reckoned with in the industry. The company’s popularity continued to be on the rise when it presented its GeForce 256 GPU to the world, thereby offering excellent 3D graphic quality. In so doing, NVIDIA outclassed Voodoo Graphics, subsequently purchasing the assets of its producer – 3dfx Interactive – in 2000. In 1997, Microsoft chose NVIDIA to develop graphic cards for its Xbox video game console.\n\n1995 – NVIDIA released its first chip, having invested $10 million in its development, the money it raised from Sutter Hill Ventures and Sequoia Capital.\n\n1994 – A year later, the company signed an agreement with SGS-Thomson Microelectronics, a European wafer fabricator. This partnership enabled NVIDIA to create its single-chip GUI accelerator or sound/graphic board. NVIDIA also arranged for Diamond Multimedia Systems to install these chips in multimedia accelerator boards.\n\n1993 – The company, which now produces graphics processors, mobile technologies, and desktop computers, was founded by three computer scientists, Jen-Hsun Huang, Curtis Priem, and Chris Malachowsky, in Santa Clara, California. The founders envisaged their logo as an “all-seeing eye.” They changed the colors of their logo, removing the black color from it over the years and finally settling on green and white, but the main concept has stayed unaltered. What is also peculiar about the company is the pronunciation of its name. In the word “NVIDIA,” the first letter “N” is pronounced separately from the rest of the sounds, as the letter “N” of the English alphabet is pronounced: /en/ -vidia. In Latin, “invidia” means “envy.”\n\nWhen they started their company, the founders saw that video games were computationally challenging but could potentially sell well. They also understood that video games would help them reach large markets. With this in mind, Jen-Hsun Huang, Curtis Priem, and Chris Malachowsky decided to establish a large R&D department to solve difficult computational problems involved in video gaming, initially investing $40,000 in the R&D team, all that they had in the bank then. With time, NVIDIA succeeded in winning $20 million of venture capital funding from Sequoia Capital and other sources.\n\nOver the years, NVIDIA has formed significant partnerships with other tech and media giants, counting overall almost 250 partners. Among these partnerships are deals with Microsoft, Hewlett Packard Enterprise, Amazon Web Services, Google, VMWare, IBM, SAS, and Lenovo."
