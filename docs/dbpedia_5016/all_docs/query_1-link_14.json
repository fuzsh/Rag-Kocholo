        "text": "In the mid-90s, Silicon Graphics (SGI) was the computer company to watch. Its machines brought T-1000 to life in Terminator 2: Judgment Day. When the teenage Lex Murphy declared: \"It's a Unix system, I know this\" in Jurassic Park, she was in front of the same kind of SGI machine used to render the dinosaurs for the movie.\n\nThe company filed for bankruptcy in New York last Wednesday, but SGI was already a distant memory for most film producers. The only suitor for SGI's assets was a relatively unknown maker of blade servers for internet companies. And Rackable Systems only had to pay $25m (Â£17m) for a company worth $7.4bn at the height of its success.\n\nThe end of SGI began 10 years ago. Customers in digital animation were beginning to buy Windows workstations, but they went for cheaper options than those supplied by the company.\n\nCluster time bomb\n\nSGI decided to focus on the supercomputer, or high-performance computing, business. But the trend of building compute clusters out of PCs and blade servers has eaten away even at that. Earl Joseph, research vice president at the analyst firm IDC, says more than 65% of high-performance computers are now clusters. Last year, Dell's sales in this market were more than five times higher than SGI's.\n\nSpecialised hardware is not popular among processing-hungry production houses, according to Simon Robinson, the chief technology officer at the London and LA-based effects developer The Foundry. \"The hardware has to be standard because our end market is people who have built up their systems over time,\" he says. Production houses cannot afford to throw out all their old hardware every time a shiny new high-performance machine comes along. Instead, they gradually add more powerful multiprocessor machines and slowly retire the older ones.\n\nClive Longbottom, service director at the analyst firm Quocirca, says this \"scale-up, scale-out\" approach has changed the landscape of supercomputing: \"When your current environment isn't enough, you don't have to trash it all and start again.\"\n\nSynopsys, which supplies software tools to businesses such as Intel to design their large chips, found it could take servers that it already had and assemble them into a virtual supercomputer that made it into the industry's listing of the top 500 fastest computers in the world. The company developed its own management software to \"go from bare metal to optimised configuration\", according to Sriram Sitaraman, a senior IT manager.\n\nAlthough some supercomputer users turn to suppliers such as HP and IBM to do the job for them, others simply roll their own because so much of the hardware is now standard. Without the money to design much of their own silicon, they have to buy off-the-shelf PC processors and memory. Mark Parsons, commercial director at the Edinburgh Parallel Computing Centre (EPCC), complains: \"We are going through this really boring period in computing.\"\n\nThanks to the arrival of quad-core processors, the aggregate performance of the latest supercomputers and clusters look good on paper. But not as good in practice. The coming upgrade to the Hector machine based at Edinburgh, the UK's national supercomputing service, will see the speed of each individual processor cut by about 15%. \"At the same time, the memory bandwidth is only rising from 10GBps to 12GBps,\" says Parsons.\n\nInstead of sharing 10GBps between two processors, the upgrade will see four processors squabbling over access to a 12GBps pipe to memory. \"It's a 40% reduction in bandwidth into each core. But the way to keep the core busy is faster memory to push data into it,\" says Parsons.\n\nThe alternative to simply packing more multicore PC processors into blade servers is to use specialised accelerator processors. SGI had been drumming up interest in this approach at the MRSC supercomputing conference in Berlin last month. The company aimed to use four different types of accelerator in one machine.\n\nFoot on the accelerator\n\nCharles Gillan, principal engineer at the Institute of Electronics, Communications and Information Technology (ECIT) based at Queen's University, Belfast, says: \"SGI was the only company trying to bring the heterogeneous accelerator to market.\" He points out that chipmakers such as AMD, Intel and Nvidia are combining standard PC cores with accelerator processors tuned for graphics.\n\nLast month, the BNP Paribas bank decided to replace a server containing 500 conventional processor cores that consumes 25kW of power with a one-teraflop machine based on Nvidia Tesla graphics processors. The bank claims the new machine will improve throughput 15-fold but use less than 10% of the electricity.\n\nSteve Wallach, of the former supercomputer maker Convex, has formed a new company, Convey, to make machines that rewire themselves to suit the job at hand. SGI hoped to use this technique to build its heterogeneous accelerator.\n\nRackable is keeping quiet about its plans for SGI: another company could still outbid it. But, if it keeps the accelerator project alive, the company that absorbs SGI may yet take part in the evolution of the next supercomputer."
