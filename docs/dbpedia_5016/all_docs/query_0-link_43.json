        "text": "In May, FORBES broke the news that Silicon Valley investor Peter Thiel bankrolled Hulk Hogan's infamous sex-tape lawsuit against the now-bankrupt Gawker. You might be wondering: so what? Why should I care? Critics have argued that Thiel's money gives other billionaires a blueprint for how to silence media outlets they dislike. Thiel's approach has also added a new twist to what's known as \"alternate litigation financing,\" which, until now was strictly a business opportunity. No longer.\n\nAugust 2004: PayPal cofounder and venture capitalist Peter Thiel becomes Facebook's first institutional investor when he commits $500,000 to the company for a more than 10 percent stake. He takes a seat alongside CEO Mark Zuckerberg on the board in April 2005, a position which he still holds today. When Facebook goes public on May 18, 2012, Thiel is one of the company's biggest winners. He is now worth an estimated $2.7 billion and has sold off most of his stake in the social media company.\n\nDecember 19, 2007: Gawker.com publishes a story with the headline \"Peter Thiel is totally gay, people.\" Many feel the story is a public outing of Thiel, though Gawker defends the post, saying Thiel had come out to close friends in the past. Regardless, those close to Thiel tell FORBES the story left a mark, and that it was likely part of his motivation for going after Gawker in court. In a recent interview with The New York Times, Thiel says \"Gawker has been a singularly terrible bully.\"\n\nMay 18, 2009: Peter Thiel compares Valleywag, Gawker's Silicon Valley-focused website, to Al Qaeda in an interview. \"I think they should be described as terrorists, not as writers or reporters,\" he said. \"I don’t understand the psychology of people who would kill themselves and blow up buildings, and I don’t understand people who would spend their lives being angry.\" Valleywag would go on to publish dozens of stories about Thiel and other high-profile figures in Silicon Valley.\n\nOctober 4, 2012: Gawker publishes video clips showing Hulk Hogan, whose real name is Terry Bollea, having sex with his friend's wife, Heather Clem. Former Gawker editor AJ Daulerio details the scene in a story that remains on the site today. \"Because the internet has made it easier for all of us to be shameless voyeurs and deviants, we love to watch famous people have sex,\" Daulerio writes. \"We watch this footage because it's something we're not supposed to see...\" The story draws more than 7 million views.\n\nOctober 5, 2012: Hulk Hogan's personal attorney, David Houston, demands Gawker remove the sex tape clips he says were filmed without Hogan's knowledge. Gawker initially refuses, prompting Hogan to hire additional lawyers and prepare a lawsuit. Houston sends two letters to Gawker in the days after the clips were published. Gawker eventually removes the video in the ensuing litigation, publishing a story update: \"The video posted here has been removed pending litigation.\"\n\nOctober 15, 2012: Hulk Hogan's new lawyer, Charles Harder, files a lawsuit against Gawker in a Florida court. Harder became involved with the case between the publication of the tape and the complaint filing. Based in LA, Harder has represented celebrities like George Clooney. It's unclear how Harder became connected to Hogan and when Peter Thiel began funding the litigation. Both Harder and Thiel have declined to discuss specifics of their agreement with FORBES.\n\nDecember 5, 2012: Charles Harder's partner and friend, Jeffrey Abrams, files incorporation paperwork with the California Secretary of State to start a law firm. Insiders say the firm, Harder Mirell & Abrams LLP, has made suing Gawker its \"bread and butter.\" Harder disputes this, telling FORBES, \"The matters against Gawker is one aspect of my firm’s practice. We represent numerous businesses and individuals in a plethora of legal matters that have nothing to do with Gawker.\"\n\nDecember 28, 2012: Charles Harder files an amended complaint with a Florida court on behalf of Hulk Hogan. Underneath his signature, Harder signs \"Harder Mirell & Abrams,\" making the filing the firm's first. Harder brought Hogan's case, along with work for a slew of other celebrity clients, with him when he left his former firm, Wolf Rifkin Shapiro Schulman & Rabkin LLP, around the same time. Hogan's lawsuit would drag on in court for more than three years, drawing lots of media attention.\n\nFebruary 7, 2013: A plaintiff in an eventual class action lawsuit against Gawker signs a retainer agreement with Harder to have the lawyer work on his behalf in a case involving unpaid interns. Harder, who typically represents celebrity clients, would not go on to represent the plaintiffs in court; the case was eventually dismissed. Harder later tells FORBES, \"It is shocking that Gawker would rather spend a million dollars on lawyers to fight its interns, than simply pay that money to the interns.\"\n\nJune 17, 2015: Meanith Huon, a plaintiff in one of many lawsuits currently pending against Gawker, tells a judge during a court hearing in Illinois that he isn’t worried about continuing his case against the media company because he was “getting support from Hulk Hogan’s lawyers in California.” Huon and Harder would both decline to comment on the case when questioned by FORBES. The suit is now on appeal in the 7th circuit court. Huon is an attorney and represents himself in the case.\n\nJanuary 2016: Gawker executives, led by founder Nick Denton, agree to sell a minority stake in the company to Russian billionaire Viktor Vekselberg and his company, Columbus Nova Technology Partners. The deal would mark the first time the company has taken outside investment. Gawker later says the money was used, in part, to defend itself from ongoing litigation. Denton tells FORBES that, if not for the slew of lawsuits he's up against, the company would be profitable.\n\nJanuary 19, 2016: Charles Harder files a lawsuit against Gawker on behalf of writer Ashley Terrill, alleging the website “published a false and highly defamatory hit-piece.\" In the Gawker story, journalist Sam Biddle details a series of back and forth exchanges between Terrill and executives at the dating app Tinder. \"At the center is Ashley Terrill, a Hollywood columnist on an obsessive, possibly unhinged pursuit of what she says is the truth about [Tinder cofounder] Whitney Wolfe,\" Biddle writes.\n\nMarch 7, 2016: Hulk Hogan’s case against Gawker begins in a state court in St. Petersburg, Fla.\n\nHogan, who alleges that the New York-based news organization invaded his privacy when it published a video clip of him having sex with his friend's wife, testifies that Gawker’s airing of the video “turned my world upside down.” Hogan and his attorneys seek $100 million in damages from Gawker, its CEO Nick Denton and its former editor AJ Daulerio.\n\nMarch 18, 2016: A Florida jury awards Hulk Hogan with a $115 million judgment after finding that Gawker invaded the former wrestler's privacy. That amount is later bolstered by an additional $25 million for punitive damages for a total of $140 million. (Gawker is now working to appeal the verdict as it navigates bankruptcy proceedings.) Founder Nick Denton says in a statement, \"We feel very positive about the appeal that we have already begun preparing, as we expect to win this case.\"\n\nApril 5, 2016: Hulk Hogan's lawyer, Charles Harder, publishes a guest column in the Hollywood Reporter detailing how his client won his case against Gawker. Harder wrote \"The jury's verdict sends a message to irresponsible websites: Think twice before you invade someone's privacy or violate their rights.\"\n\nThe articles includes a picture of Harder's legal team, along with Hogan, celebrating their win over a champagne-fueled dinner the night the verdict was announced.\n\nMay 2, 2016: Hogan files a subsequent lawsuit against Gawker alleging extortion around the publication of his sex tape. Charles Harder represents Hogan. Gawker responds to the suit by calling it \"ridiculous\" and accuses Hogan of \"abusing the court system to control his public image.\" The case does not draw as much attention as the former wrestler's previous lawsuit, in part because the proceedings have been overshadowed by Gawker's subsequent bankruptcy filings.\n\nMay 10, 2016: Harder files a lawsuit in Massachusetts against Gawker on behalf of Shiva Ayyadurai, who alleges that the website defamed him when journalist Sam Biddle wrote an article in 2012 for Gawker-owned Gizmodo, challenging Ayyadurai's claims that he invented email. In his suit, Ayyadurai, an MIT graduate married to actress Fran Drescher, seeks $35 million in damages. Ayyadurai later tells FORBES that no lawyer would take his case before Harder agreed.\n\nMay 24, 2016: FORBES breaks news that billionaire venture capitalist Peter Thiel funded Hogan's expenses in his lawsuits against Gawker. \"It is not illegal for an outside entity to help fund another party’s lawsuit, and the practice, known as 'third-party litigation funding' has become increasingly common in the U.S,\" FORBES notes. \"Typically, the outside party negotiates for a defined share of any proceeds.\" The news prompts calls for Facebook to remove Thiel from its board.\n\nMay 25, 2016: Peter Thiel explains his reasoning for funding Hulk Hogan's case, along with others brought against Gawker (he declined to name them), in an interview with the New York Time. Thiel referred to his funding of the litigation as \"one of my greater philanthropic things that I've done,\" and says he's spent roughly $10 million bankrolling lawsuits against Gawker. Funding arrangements like this are usually done to make a return on investment. Thiel, though, said it's \"not a business venture.\"\n\nMay 26, 2016: Gawker founder Nick Denton pens an open letter to Peter Thiel, raising a host of unanswered questions. \"Is your goal to bankrupt, buy, or wound Gawker Media? If you were to own the company after a final judgment in the Hogan case, what would your editorial strategy be?\" Denton asks. He continued, \"When you say your aim is deterrence rather than revenge, whom do you aim to deter?\" The letter comes on the heels of Thiel's first extended interview about the lawsuit.\n\nJune 10, 2016: Gawker files for Chapter 11 bankruptcy after a Florida judge denies a request for a stay that would have allowed the company to avoid immediately paying Hogan's judgment as it worked on an appeal. At the same time, the company begins an auction supervised by the court. Publisher Ziff Davis is the first bidder and enters an asset purchase agreement for less than $100 million. (At one point Gawker was valued at more than $250 million. Nick Denton still controls the company.)\n\nJune 15, 2016: FORBES reveals that conservative blogger Charles \"Chuck\" Johnson, widely regarded as an internet troll, had contact with Charles Harder's firm about his own defamation lawsuit against Gawker. Johnson sued Gawker in Missouri in the summer of 2015, alleging that Gawker had defamed him in a series of articles. Before the case could be dismissed, he filed a nearly identical lawsuit in California. Johnson is representing himself in the case, which is due back in court this year.\n\nAugust 1, 2016: Gawker founder Nick Denton files for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection to prevent Hulk Hogan from collecting his share of the $140 million jury verdict. In his filing, Denton estimates his own net worth to be between $10 million to $50 million. Denton is also leading Gawker’s efforts to sell of its assets in a court-advised auction. “The brands and the business, which we have built together, are in amazingly robust shape,” Denton wrote in a memo to employees.\n\nAugust 16, 2016: Univision Communications agrees to buy Gawker Media’s assets for $135 million after outbidding digital publisher Ziff Davis in a bankruptcy auction. Univision, which oversees publications like Fusion and The Onion, ends Gawker’s 14-year run as an independent company. Denton, who previously valued Gawker at $250 million, said he’s “pleased” employees will be able to continue to work at Univision “disentangled from the legal campaign against this company.”\n\nAugust 18, 2016: Univision and Gawker Media announce Gawker.com will shut down after 13 years. Univision says it will continue operating Gawker Media's other six sites, including Jezebel, Gizmodo and Deadspin. In a meeting with Gawker staff, Isaac Lee, Univision's chief digital officer, says the decision not to continue Gawker.com had been made the day a Florida jury awarded former professional wrestler Hulk Hogan more than $140 million in his invasion of privacy lawsuit against Gawker.\n\nNovember 2, 2016: Gawker agrees to a settlement with Hogan and two other plaintiffs represented by Charles Harder, the Hollywood attorney who has made suing the company his firm's ' bread and butter.' In addition to paying out more than $32 million, Gawker agrees to remove from its archives the stories that spurred the lawsuits. The deal must be approved by a federal bankruptcy judge and the group of unsecured creditors before it is finalized."
