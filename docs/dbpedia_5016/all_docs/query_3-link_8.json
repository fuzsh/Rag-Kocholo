Quake .. trip.. crashed the network at the job .. was it a Banshee?? sounds alot like on winbin\n\nThe company I worked at sold a lot of SGI - Crimson, Onyx, Indigo. Siemens bought 30 of them for solids modelling, CNC machine emulation, and wind tunnel emulation. We configured them before shipping then had a large LAN party with everyone before packing them up and sending to the customer. It had a great tank battle, flight simulator and dog fight game that came free.\n\nI do remember the Onyx. wish I could forget those times though. Erase them from images burned onto brain. sad being those were the roaring 20s\n\nIN 1995-96 was learning Discreet Logic's Flint on an indy. Later (1999) was working on an Octane workstation. These machine were never turned off but for maintence. A certified engineer was mandatory to fix a minor or major issue. IRIX was a fantastic os. what a time...\n\nRight I suppose... much like the tick tick tick from the faucet in the bathroom. always seems to be the best jobs to have only require about a 1/4 turn\n\n\"The OpenGL standard remains the only cross-platform 3D-graphics API and has even been ported to cell phones and other portable devices. \"\n\n/* Vulkan has entered the chat */\n\nCross platform is the only real distinction that matters here. DirectX was ported to cell phones. Metal was ported to cell phones. I think even libgcm made it to the Vita which is a portable device. Every closed operating system tends to offer a 3D-graphics API. And there is no reason to have two mature open graphics APIs... which now is Vulkan.\n\n\"The OpenGL standard remains the only cross-platform 3D-graphics API and has even been ported to cell phones and other portable devices. \"\n\n/* Vulkan has entered the chat */\n\nCross platform is the only real distinction that matters here.

It's a step into low-level territory, like D3D 11 -> D3D 12, but it still is the same elements. Vulkan is governed by the same Khronos. Before the release they even called it \"OpenGL next\".\n\nAlso, it's irrelevant if Vulkan is \"multi-platform\" because that in essence means it runs on Linux. Too bad the relevant platforms are anything but Linux. Windows is doing fine with D3D, same goes for the Xbox. The PlayStation has Gnm(x) which is in fact more similar to D3D than OpenGL/Vulkan. And macOS has Metal. So yeah, there's no reason to have 2 mature APIs, so Vulkan serves no purpose whatsoever.\n\nVulkan is OpenGL.

One customer \" Blue Sky Studios\" had a combination of MAC, and SGI workstations.\n\nThe rendering end was 500 pizza box size Alphas. All the rendering was sent to a TRU64 Alpha cluster. I spent a lot of time there during production of \"Ice Age\".\n\nI believe they are using Linux based systems now.\n\nSGI machines were good in there time. The TRU64 clusters were also very good in there time.\n\nI was fortunate enough to work for DEC (Then Compaq--> HP) at a time when all kinds of neat and new stuff was coming along at a pretty good pace."
