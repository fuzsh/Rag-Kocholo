        "text": "The Onyx-1 is a specialised 'supercomputer' that marks a significant step in the development of computer graphics and animation production technologies used in television commercials and film production. Also known as a Reality Engine, the name of the graphics calculation card it used, it led the way in special-purpose computing systems using existing and newly designed devices to make the production of high-end graphics feasible within the time-frames and resolution requirements of the television and film industries. It is a good example from the short period in computing when large, very fast systems became available for commercial rather than military purposes. They were superseded by clusters of PCs. Most of the Geometry Engine's tasks are now carried out by the graphics display card of the modern PC, which has been driven by the needs of the computer game industry. It employs specially developed hardware (the 'Reality Engine') to carry out the mathematically intensive tasks of creating both fantastic and realistic 3D computer models of objects and creatures. Up until the mid-1980s computer graphics had to be produced on large-scale general purpose mainframe computers with purpose-built application software. Smaller systems, such as the graphics workstations used in architecture or the PC based systems used in 2D paintbox image making for corporate purposes, were extremely slow and of inadequate resolution when it came to graphic and animation work for film production. As the industry grew, new technologies had to be developed to allow the production industry's demands to be fulfilled. Australia has a significant reputation on the world stage for the quality of its graphics production and the development of high-end production software. This particular machine was imported by the Future Reality Company for Garner MacLennan Design (GMD), which at the time was a strong competitor for Animal Logic and was engaged in television commercials. When this particular machine was first brought into the country the Defence Department had to clear it as it was considered to be a supercomputer. Once it arrived at GMD it was upgraded to a 16 processor system and installed in the GMD facility in Crows Nest, Sydney."
