With love, AYATI Board of Directors Jigisha Patel Sneha Desai Sneha Patel Sheila Rohra Piyush Mehta Attend our gala here: https://lnkd.in/gDXJ9ZEc\n\nThere was a time when we did not think there would be enough jobs for 30 electronic game design students per year, let alone the 260 currently being trained at Nanyang Polytechnic(NYP) each year... Super thrilled to take this picture with Low Wei Fann Francois and Jiu Len Wong who are both studying game development at NYP, in front of a green screen. I managed the electronic games portfolio at Singapore Economic Development Board (EDB) in 1997-8 and worked closely with the NYP team to build out their state of the art Silicon Graphics animation lab then. At the time, game development in Singapore was still in its infancy. Together with the NYP leaders, we fretted if the 30 students in each cohort would have jobs upon graduation. Fast forward to today. Companies like Ubisoft, Bandai Namco Mobile, and XII Braves Pte Ltd call Singapore their home, and hundreds of games have been developed here. Each year NYP graduates 260 talented developers and content creatives, with many securing jobs before graduation. So thankful to Chairman of NYP, Tong Hai Tan, for the chance to catch up with old friends at NYP. NYP has grown from strength to strength under his leadership. üí™üèø #IndustryDevelopment #Games #Talent\n\nA massive alliance has formed to promote Open Source as a counterbalance to OpenAI , Microsoft, Google & Anthropic While IBM & Meta are leading the charge, NVIDIA, AMD , Hugging Face & many other #AI leaders are a part of the new alliance. So are professional open source server OS pioneers #RedHat & The Linux Foundation, major research universities like Harvard University, Yale University, University of California, Berkeley, Cornell University, Dartmouth College, University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign as well as NASA - National Aeronautics and Space Administration & CERN It‚Äôs a classic battle we‚Äôve seen numerous times in the rapidly evolving tech industry since Sun Microsystems went up against proprietary engineering workstations , servers & operating systems from companies like Hewlett Packard Enterprise, & Silicon Graphics, & when Microsoft Server went up against & #Linux. Historically, open source comes out on top over time. Open source LLMs are advancing at a faster rate than proprietary models but still have a way to go to catch OpenAI Game on. #OpenSource #AI William Allison Utkarsh Pandey Adam Cutler Ashley L.
