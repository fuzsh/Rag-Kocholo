        "text": "General FAQ\n\nWhat is IRIX? Is it a Linux, a BSD?\n\nIRIX is a proprietary variant of UNIX System V developed from the late-1980s to 2006 by Silicon Graphics Inc. It shares an ancestry with Sun/Oracle Solaris, AIX, HP-UX and other proprietary UNIX operating systems. Like most, it contains significant BSD code. It's not related to GNU/Linux in any way.\n\nWhat does IRIX run on? Is it open source?\n\nIRIX is closed source and only runs on Silicon Graphics and some CRAY hardware. All of these use MIPS processors, running in big-endian mode.\n\nWhy should I bother with IRIX?\n\nIRIX is historically important, as it is the source of XFS, a major player in CGI, CAD, and the development of SMP for Linux and BSD, as well as HPC (High Performance Computing)\n\nWhere can I get IRIX?\n\nIRIX has not been sold by SGI (Now owned by HP Enterprise) in over a decade. We offer IRIX versions on the FTP servers and mirrors, and also you may buy CDs of it on eBay.\n\nAny efforts to open source IRIX? Can it be emulated?\n\nThe answer is currently no and yes, sort of. HP Enterprise has no plans as of 2020 to open source IRIX. Unfortunately, there is no widely functional emulator the way there is for Amigas or other vintage computers, but limited support has been added to MAME. Please keep discussion about this in the appropriate categories.\n\nWhat happened to SGI?\n\nSGI phased out the MIPS-powered Silicon Graphics hardware in early 2006, in favor of Intel's Itanium running variants of Linux. It later went bankrupt in 2009, and was purchased by Rackable Systems, who rebranded as Silicon Graphics International, and then in 2016 HP Enterprise purchased SGI, ending all support for SGI's MIPS and IA-64 computers.\n\nWhats a cheap SGI?\n\nUnlike Amigas, there's really no clear cut answer. Prices range from under $100 USD for a relatively low end system, to over $1000 USD for a top end system.\n\nWhat happened to Nekochan.net?\n\nNekochan.net, which started sometime in 2001 or earlier, was shut down by its admin, Peter Plank in May of 2018 due to alleged concerns over the EU Regulations of the GPDR.\n\nWhen did IRIX Network start?\n\nIRIX Network was started by Raion in 2017 along with his friend and colleague Praetor.\n\nWhere can I find the sgi logo font?\n\nThat's available here: https://www.download-free-fonts.com/details/79810/sgi-text\n\nWhat happened to IRIX.CC/IRIX.PW?\n\nThat's just the old domain name. It's not called IRIX.CC and never was. Please do not call the site IRIX.CC.\n\nIRIX Network or IRIXNet is fine.\n\nDevelopment FAQ\n\nWhat compilers are available for IRIX?\n\nIRIX has a few compilers, the native option being MIPSPro, and the alternatives being LCC (Little C Compiler) and GCC (only up to 4.7.x in mainline, see below).\n\nCan you cross-compile for IRIX?\n\nNo, not using the native toolchain. You can using GCC and binutils, but this brings far more bugs, and limitations and is highly discouraged as GNU does not accept IRIX patches upstream.\n\nWhy is GCC 4.8.x and higher not supported?\n\nGNU's policy for compiler support is as follows: They only hold an obligation to support proprietary OSes as long as convenient, plus pending vendor support. As it's no longer convenient, IRIX joins the graveyard alongside old Solaris and AIX versions."
