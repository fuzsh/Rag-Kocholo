        "text": "Storied Sunnyvale tech company Silicon Graphics, the onetime multibillion-dollar company that rose to fame in the 1990s by helping Hollywood create blockbusters like “Jurassic Park,” agreed to sell itself for a mere $25 million Wednesday after seeking bankruptcy protection for the second time in three years.\n\nIf the bankruptcy judge approves the sale to Fremont-based Rackable Systems, which makes servers and storage devices for data centers, it might mark the final chapter for SGI, which was founded in 1982 and has taken a painful tailspin into near obscurity in recent years.\n\nRackable Systems CEO Mark Barrenechea is hopeful. “They are a Silicon Valley icon,” he said. “We believe the entire business is of compelling value to Rackable.”\n\nStill, the news is “kind of sad,” said Rob Enderle, an analyst with the Enderle Group in San Jose, which tracks emerging technologies. “At one time, SGI was really thought to be where much of the creativity was going to occur in Silicon Valley. They were the guys kind of on the forefront of virtual reality.”\n\nNo decision has been made yet about whether Rackable would retain the corporate name of SGI, which makes servers, supercomputers, data storage devices and related software, and has become a shell of what it once was.\n\nSGI was the brainchild of Jim Clark, an associate professor at Stanford University, who later went on to found Internet titan Netscape. By making computer workstations that could produce incredibly fast graphics, SGI in the 1990s became a darling of Hollywood special-effects designers, who used its technology to help make such movies as “Terminator 2,” “Star Wars” and “Jurassic Park.”\n\nIn 1993, President Bill Clinton dropped by the company for a visit. And SGI was bringing in lots of money. In 1997, its fiscal year sales totaled $3.66 billion.\n\nBut by the next year, problems were surfacing. The company laid off hundreds of employees. SGI hired Rick Belluzzo, Hewlett-Packard’s executive vice president and general manager of its computer organization, to be its CEO, but he abruptly resigned the following year. Things went downhill from there.\n\nEnderle contends SGI delved into too many product areas. In addition, many of SGI’s customers turned to cheaper computer systems made by its competitors. SGI also plunged into debt.\n\nIt started shedding some of its assets and cutting expenses.\n\nIn 2000, it sold its interest in supercomputer maker Cray Research. In 2003, it vacated its Mountain View headquarters and leased the buildings to Google. Two years later, it hired a turnaround company to help it stop hemorrhaging money. But in May 2006, the company filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection and emerged from that status in October.\n\nSince then, it has maintained a broad array of customers that use its technology to simulate global climate changes, design automobiles and help businesses manage large amounts of data. It also has a number of contracts with the Defense Department and various intelligence agencies.\n\nNonetheless, demand for its high-end computer systems has eroded in part because of increasing competition from such companies as HP, Sun Microsystems and IBM, according to the company’s latest bankruptcy filing. It lost $153 million during its 2008 fiscal year and its current bankruptcy filing lists $390 million in assets along with nearly $527 million in liabilities.\n\nAs part of its proposed purchase of SGI, Rackable has agreed to take on an undisclosed portion of those liabilities. But there’s a chance Rackable may not wind up acquiring the company. The deal not only has to be approved by the bankruptcy judge, but also the Chapter 11 provisions SGI used allow other interested companies to submit their own bids for SGI, which Rackable will have the option to match.\n\nAssuming Rackable does buy SGI, several analysts said it’s unclear whether it would be getting a good deal, in part because SGI’s falling fortunes have made its business less visible in recent years.\n\n“No one knows a lot about SGI,” said Pacific Crest Securities analyst Brent Bracelin. He said some of SGI’s products use what he called “last-decade’s kind of technology” and that it’s unclear how well those would fit with the devices Rackable sells.\n\nBut Merriman Curhan Ford analyst Alex Kurtz noted that Rackable — which has been losing money in recent quarters — may benefit from acquiring SGI’s customers.\n\n“It might be a smart move in the end,” he said. “We’ll have to see.”\n\nAnother unanswered question is what would happen to SGI’s 1,169 employees, 142 of whom work in Sunnyvale. Barrenechea, who said Rackable has about 300 employees, declined to speculate on that. But Bob Pette, SGI’s vice president of corporate marketing and visualization, said “we believe 90-plus percent of the employees will be unaffected by this.”\n\nRackable’s stock price fell 18 cents to $3.88 and SGI’s dropped 23 cents to 18 cents Wednesday."
