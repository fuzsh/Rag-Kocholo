Mashey) Date: Nov 13 1995 Newsgroups: misc.invest.stocks,comp.graphics A week ago, in reply to a question I posted a few simple questions to Intergraph about the demo that \"proved\" the new Intergraph workstations blew away SGI... and also emailed them to several Integraph employees, and this will go to more. Possibly I've missed the reply, and if so, perhaps someone would point me at it. In any case, take this as a 2nd request for simple, non-proprietary information on a publicly-shown demo: c) What were the run-times? d) What was the program and its input files? And if the program was produced by Intergraph, was the tuning done on SGI commensurate with that on NT? Following is the text of the original post: From: mash@mash.engr.sgi.com (John R.

Would you care to comment on the demo on a price |> to performance basis and other rellavent benchmarks? thanks. Yes, although I have to do this secondhand from talking to press and analysts who attended, or to other people who saw it on TV broadcasts. (It showed some Intergraph P6 box beating an Indigo2, running some recalc or rendering problem that took several minutes, with the Intergraph finishing ~30 seconds earlier, and the Intel or Intergraph speaker then turning to the Indigo and making remarks like \"still going\". Lots of comments were made to effect that SGI's graphics performance was now blown away by PC-class machines (or words to that effect). I'm short on time, back in a few days, but basically: 1) It appears to be a *CPU* demo, not a graphics demo, i.e., something that runs a few minutes to display a few frames is *not* an interactive graphics benchmark ... and in fact, has very little to do with the graphics hardware. 2) It was versus a 200MHz (15-18 months old) R4400 with Extreme graphics (>2 years old) ... although the latter appears to be irrelevant, i.e., while the cost comparison was verus the I2Extreme ... an Indy with much less expensive graphics would have run at least as well... Now, it is not implausible that a 200Mhz Pentium Pro be faster than a200Mhz R4400 on raw CPU benchmarks, although it is not guaranteed either (the R4400 has a larger L2 cache, which doesn't help small benchmarks much, but may, or may not make a difference on larger ones. Of course, we have been shipping faster R4400s (250Mhz) for a while, and for some FP-intense problems, people use 75MHz R8000s.) 3) Actually, this brings to mind the wish to ask some of the Intergraph posters for a little data, which surely cannot take more than a few minutes to find, and post, and most of which cannot possibly be proprietary: a) We think the Indigo2 was 200MHz, 1MB cache, 64MB memory, Extreme. We think it had a 1280x1024 24-bit color display. is this right? b) We think the Intergraph was also 200Mhz, although we don't know if it had one or two CPUs, and we don't know if it had the 1152x864 display (i.e., 76% of the 1280x1024 size) or a larger display, and we're not sure which graphics board was in there ... although from the appearance of the run, it likely doesn't matter much. But the interesting questions are: c) What were the two actual run-times? d) Exactly what was the program and the input dataset that produced the demo? I.e., are we allowed to know this, or must we guess? d1) Was the program some third-party CAD package, i.e., something provided by somebody else, and likely to have been optimized for both platforms? If so, what are the versions? OR d2) Was the program an Intergraph package that is shipped (or will be) as a product on Windows/NT, but not on IRIX? If so, can you provide any backup for the idea that there might have been equal tuning and optimization of the package running on IRIX? OK: djallen@ingr.com & rbarnes@ingr.com: it can't take much to answer those questions...

If this is so and meaningful: a) Most of the PC business will have gone under, since regular Pentiums will have to be selling for much less. b) Intergraph, which is selling 2-CPU systems in the $20K range, will be gone for sure, since one could trivially buy such a $2K system, add a $500 graphics accelerator [if one believes the claims of such being equal to the best workstations :-)], and run the exact same software. Thanks for reminding me about this demo (the press release). 1) Over the last month, I have several times, in this newsgroup, challenged Intergraph people to explain the could-not-possibly be proprietary details of this demonstration, so that reasonable people could evaluate the meaning of the demo, and understand: a) Did the benchmark actually use much of the Indigo2Extreme's graphics hardware (whose price was certainly included), or was it really a CPU benchmark masquerading as an interactive graphics benchmark? (i.e., would it have run just as fast on a low-end Indy?) b) What were the corresponding run-times? c) If it was really a CPU benchmark of an Intergraph internal application, was it tuned and optimized as well on the Indigo2, or perhaps was it terrifically well-tuned on the Intergraph ... and not on the Indigo2. d) All of this is strange, since Intergraph literature claims many applications also available on SGI ... and hence, one would have expected plenty of head-to-head demoes on interactive graphics performance... Of course, Intergraph's literature repeatedly claims: \"Intergraph is the world's largest company dedicated to supplying interactive computer graphics systems.\" (Can anybody explain a use of the English language that lets that be true? Note that Intergraph's Web pages mention servers, just like Sun or SGI...) 2) So far, after posting politely (and emailing, just to make sure), it's been a month, and nobody has chosen to answer some very simple questions. Thoughtful people may want to consider why... and calibrate further examples from the same sources.... -john mashey DISCLAIMER: <generic disclaimer, I speak for me only, etc> UUCP: mash@sgi.com DDD: 415-933-3090 FAX: 415-967-8496 USPS: Silicon Graphics 6L-005, 2011 N.

Well, since you mentioned SGI ... 1) Lots of people, in their right minds, *would* do low-end 3D without hardware acceleration for geometry, but using the CPU's FPU. *SGI* does. 2) This makes perfect sense as part of product line: a) You might design a system with everything built-in, then you get what you get [i.e., like a video game]. b) But most people design systems that can take a range of graphics boards with different characteristics, with: - a range of frame-buffer sizes - 8-bit ... 24-bit color - Z-buffering, or not - texture [and size of texture memory], fogging, real-time- anti-aliasing, various image and video processing, etc, etc]. - hardware geometry acceleration. c) Consider the lowest-cost graphics board that *has* hardware geometry ... in many designs you can save some more money if you delete that hardware, and that lets you hit one more price point, and it may be adequate if you're doing fairly light 3D. d) It does help to have a processor like the recent MIPS R5000, that, for its cost, is especially good at 32-bit floating-point (i.e., pipelined 1/cycle, with 4-cycle latency). (note, BTW, that the SPEC fp benchmarks have very little 32-bit floating-point, so they don't necessarily tell you much.) e) Of course, there is a huge variation in performance: just inside SGI's product line are performance metrics that vary by at least 1000:1 between a low-end Indy and a high-end Onyx + Reality Engine2s. [This is why the commonly-made statement: \"Add this graphics board to a PC and you'll get the 3D graphics performance of an SGI workstation\" is fairly vacuous, i.e., a more precise comparison than to something with a 1:1000 range would make more sense :-) ] -- -john mashey DISCLAIMER: <generic disclaimer, I speak for me only, etc> UUCP: mash@sgi.com DDD: 415-933-3090 FAX: 415-967-8496 USPS: Silicon Graphics 6L-005, 2011 N.

(b) Despite SGI's skill in this ara ... we always have customers who want *more* (both more at a specific price, at more at almost any price) and know what they'd do with it if they could get get it! I must admit, it is frustrating to talk with a research head of a Fortune50 company who says: \"If you can do XXX, we'd buy 50 of them, whatever they cost, otherwise we'll buy 1 of your fastest.\" A: sorry, we can't do that yet. \"So when?\" A: sometime after the year 2001 we'll get fast enough. <good discussion of accelerators> . |> >>It's the accelerators that made SGI such a hot item, not \"its\" CPUs. |> |> I'm pretty sure that their Impact series of accelerators transforms the |> polygons as well as rasterizes them, but I don't know about the Extremes |> and other earlier accelerators.

Note that a given application may be: (1) Light on CPU and graphics (2) Light on CPU, heavy on graphics (3) Heavy on CPU, light on graphics (4) Heavy on CPU, heavy on graphics and people buy different systems to cover these, although they do like to be able to run the same binaries. If it seems weird to have this many variation, it's sometimes hard to explain: it's easier to see. A good demo is when we show people around our demo center, starting with a rotating lighted model: a) On an Indy, it's OK, flat-shaded. b) On an Indigo2 Extreme, it's OK Gouraud-shaded. But go back to the Indy, turn the Gouraud on, it slows down. c) On an Indigo2 Impact, it's fine with reflection-mapping. Go back to the Extreme, try that ... and it basically stops. Do not go back to the Indy. Put another way, everybody does graphics demoes that look good, by making sure that the machine can do the job ... it's only when you see two systems side-by-side trying to do the same thing, with 10:1 to 1000:1 differences, that the differences become truly obvious. -- -john mashey DISCLAIMER: <generic disclaimer, I speak for me only, etc> UUCP: mash@sgi.com DDD: 415-933-3090 FAX: 415-967-8496 USPS: Silicon Graphics 6L-005, 2011 N.

In addition, there are of course demands for much higher resolution, needed to supply products to \"most people\", although not needed in volume, most likely, since likely to be expensive, i.e., some of the demands for visual simulation are for coordinated monitors/projectors with more pixels.

If so, I'll buy 50 of them, whatever they cost. If not, I'll buy one of the best you have now, and I'd like to know when you think you will be able to do that?

In particular, it is apparently still difficult to have enough resolution to show people roadsigns at the distance they can read them in real life. Other areas that wish for better resolution include defense image analysis, and closer to home, medical image analysis. -- -john mashey DISCLAIMER: <generic disclaimer: I speak for me only...> EMAIL: mash@sgi.com DDD: 415-933-3090 FAX: 415-932-3090 [416=>650 August] USPS: Silicon Graphics/Cray Research 6L-005, 2011 N.

I work for a company which makes medical printers. Our marketing people claim our product is the industry leader in image quality. We print approximately 4000x5000 pixels at 12 bits per pixel. I'm a programmer, not an image scientist, but my understanding is that precise intensity control is more valuable than spatial resolution. The average eye is an 8-9 bit device but many radiologists want 10+ bits and can tell the difference, or at least want 8 bits going through a lookup table (e.g. choose 256 from 4096). CRTs are 6-7 bits in an office environment, or 8 under good conditions with some effort. There are some technologies based on modulated reflection which might bring good intensity control to displays (see the April 28 EE Times, pages 37-38), but I think there may be problems making them large. -- John Carr (jfc@mit.edu)\n\nIndex Home About Blog"
