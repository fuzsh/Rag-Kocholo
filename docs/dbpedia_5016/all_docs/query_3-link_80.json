        "text": "Mountain View, Calif. -- Silicon Graphics, Inc. (SGI) announced results for its quarter and fiscal year ended June 30, 1996. Silicon Graphics' revenue for the fourth quarter of fiscal 1996 without giving effect to the Cray Research acquisition was $826 million, a 26 percent increase over the same quarter a year ago. The company's standalone net income for the fourth quarter was $81 million, or 46 cents per common share, compared with $53 million or 30 cents per common share in the fourth quarter of fiscal 1995. Revenue and net income recorded in the fourth quarter were the highest for any quarter in the Company's history. Silicon Graphics' standalone revenue for fiscal 1996 was $2.8 billion, a 24 percent increase over the prior year. Net income for fiscal 1996 was $245 million or $1.39 per common share, compared with $225 million or $1.28 per common share for fiscal 1995. \"The strong acceptance of our 64-bit, R10000-based products, which shipped in volume during the quarter, is driving our increased revenue growth rate,\" said Edward R. McCracken, Silicon Graphics' chairman and chief executive officer. \"Our fourth quarter results show that we are able to be aggressive on pricing while continuing to deliver industry-leading operating profits. Our solid momentum in our core markets and accelerating growth in emerging markets, like the Internet, position us to take full advantage of the opportunities ahead.\" IMPACT OF THE CRAY RESEARCH ACQUISITION Silicon Graphics acquired a 75 percent interest in Cray Research through a cash tender offer in April 1996 and acquired the remaining shares in a stock-for-stock merger effected June 30, 1996. As a result, Cray's results were consolidated with Silicon Graphics' fourth quarter results, subject to adjustment for the minority interest held by Cray's public stockholders prior to the merger. Giving effect to the acquisition, the company's total consolidated revenue for fiscal 1996 was $2.9 billion, resulting in net income of $115 million or 65 cents per common share. Total revenue for the fourth quarter was $977 million, resulting in a net loss of $49 million or 30 cents per common share. For the June quarter, Cray Research incurred an operating loss of $23 million on revenue of $151 million. The results include losses incurred by Cray's Business Systems Division, which was sold to Sun Microsystems effective July 2, 1996. \"As anticipated, this was a transition quarter for Cray Research, both because of the forthcoming T90 and T3E products as well as merger-related activities,\" said McCracken. \"Nonetheless, Cray Research did grow its backlog during the quarter, which indicates continued strong customer relationships. With the merger now complete, we are looking forward to a successful fiscal 1997.\" Pre-tax acquisition-related charges for the fourth quarter were $102 million, including a $98 million write-off of purchased in-process research and development. In addition, because purchase accounting requires that purchased work-in-process and finished goods be written up to fair value, gross margins in the fourth quarter were reduced by approximately $18 million, as a portion of that inventory was sold to customers. The company's consolidated backlog at June 30, 1996 was $572 million, representing orders scheduled to ship during fiscal 1997. The Company's audited results for the year ended June 30, 1996 include the effects of the acquisition of Cray Research, Inc. in the fourth quarter."
