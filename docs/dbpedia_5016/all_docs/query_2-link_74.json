        "text": "From a business perspective, Unix's true breakthrough was closely tied to the emergence of a new type of machine in the early 80s: the Workstations.\n\nThese were high-end, individual machines with advanced processing capabilities, storage capacities, display features, and network connectivity, far surpassing what standard Personal Computers could offer.\n\nThe demand for these \"power monsters,\" intended to serve a single user, was primarily driven by the increasing importance of CAD/CAM, CGI and VLSI applications.\n\nOver time, industries around the world adopted these powerful machines, creating a highly lucrative market where numerous competitors vied for dominance.\n\nLet's talk Workstations\n\nAlthough there were experiments with this concept in the 1970s, the movement truly gained momentum in the early 1980s with the arrival of 32-bit CPU generations.\n\nWhat nearly all these machines have in common is the choice of Unix as their operating system, which over time would become the industry standard of this market.\n\nUnix thus became the cornerstone of a rapidly growing and flourishing market, which brought about significant changes : Now there were substantial profits to be made around Unix. ðŸ¤‘\n\nAs is often the case, this new market was initially pioneered by emerging players before catching the attention of the major industry players :\n\nApollo Computer, founded in 1980, created several generation of Worksations based on Motorola 68k CPUs and a proprietary Unix-Like, it was a major market player until its takeover by Hewlett-Packard in 1989.\n\nSun Microsystems, founded in 1982, emerged as the industry leader, initially with machines based on the Motorola 68k and later on its proprietary SPARC RISC CPU. The company's Unix operating system was originally based on 4.2BSD.\n\nSilicon Graphics, founded in 1981, distinguish itself by focusing on the emerging market for 3D CGI applications. Like many of its competitors, the company initially used Motorola 68k processors before transitioning to RISC architecture with MIPS. The operating system Irix was based on AT&T's UNIX System V with BSD extensions they employed was initially.\n\nFaced with a juicy B2B market, the historical players could not ignore the movement, so :\n\nIn 1986, IBM, confident in its strong ties with large industrial companies, launched the IBM RT PC. This machine was based on a processor that was the fruit of pioneering work on the RISC approach of their lab with Project 801, which had been initiated in the early 70s and had remained on the drawing board. The RT PC was offered with three operating systems, including AIX the IBM'Unix, which was based on UNIX System V with 4.3BSD-compatible extensions. The RT PC was an announced failure, designed to keep the market busy even though the machine was still far from state-of-the-art so IBM introduced the RS/6000 workstations in 1990, which featured a new proprietary RISC the POWER1. And that's when it became a best seller, taking advantage of IBM's sales power with major corporations.\n\nDigital Equipment, despite having a strong offering with its VAX systems and VMS operating system, the company struggled in this market against competition until the introduction of the Alpha Systems range in 1992. The first 64-bit RISC architecture with OSF/1 the Unix of the Open Software Foundation (OSF) alliance.\n\nHewlett-Packard, was a very early entrants in this market, having been pioneers since the 1970s with offerings that were heavily geared towards engineers. Starting in the mid-1980s, the Series 9000 offered solutions of this type, utilizing either the Motorola 68k processors or the proprietary FOCUS architecture. However, it was after the acquisition of Apollo and the development of the proprietary PA-RISC processor that their offerings truly took off. The operating system, named HP-UX, belongs to the System V family.\n\nLets' get back to Unix\n\nSo, in less than a decade, Unix was at the heart of a business involving hundreds of thousands of machines and generating colossal sales.\n\nBut even so, it wasn't a triumph for Unix, but for Unixes.\n\nAlmost all the players were on their own version, based on System V, BSD or a mix of the two.\n\nAnd furthermore, since the breakup of AT&T, the company had regained commercial freedoms over its creation.\n\nThis period was marked by intense competition and fragmentation within the Unix community, with multiple versions of Unix being developed and promoted by different groups.\n\nThe Unix Wars\n\nThe conditions were set for the launch of what would be called the Unix Wars a series of conflicts among Unix vendors in the late 1980s and early 1990s, primarily focused on setting a standard for the Unix operating system.\n\nTo address these fragmentation issues, several groups emerged :\n\nThe X/Open Group was established in 1984 to promote open systems based on Unix.\n\nIn response to concerns that Sun Microsystems and AT&T's collaboration on System V Release 4 might dominate the market, other vendors formed the Open Software Foundation (OSF) in 1988.\n\nThe same year, Unix International (UI) was created as a counterbalance to OSF.\n\nX/Open eventually merged with the OSF in 1996, forming The Open Group.\n\nThe membership of various actors in these groups was fluid and sometimes contradictory, with twists and turns reminiscent of Game of Thrones.\n\nThe rivalry between OSF and UI, and their respective members, led to a divided Unix market.\n\nThis competition often overshadowed technical considerations, leading to commercial conflicts that slowed progress towards a unified Unix standard.\n\nThe Game of Unix Thrones\n\nIt would take an entire book to cover all the conflicts, alliances, lawsuits, and betrayals of that era. At a glance :\n\nThe acquisition of AT&T's Unix System Laboratories, and therefore the Unix trademark, by Novell in 1992.\n\nIn 1992, Unix System Laboratories filed a lawsuit in federal court in New Jersey against Berkeley Software Design, and the Regents of the University of California. The lawsuit centered on intellectual property rights related to the Unix operating system in BSD.\n\nIn 1995, Novell sold the business of administering and supporting existing UNIX licenses, along with the rights to further develop the System V code base, to the Santa Cruz Operation (SCO). However, whether Novell also transferred the copyrights to UNIX became a contentious issue and later led to litigation.\n\nIn 2000, SCO sold its entire UNIX business and assets to Caldera Systems, which later became The SCO Group. Following the burst of the dot-com bubble, consolidation in the Unix market occurred, leaving Solaris, HP-UX, and AIX as the dominant commercial variants.\n\nIn 2003, The SCO Group initiated legal action against various Linux users and vendors, claiming that Linux contained copyrighted Unix code owned by SCO.\n\nSCO also alleged trade-secret violations by IBM and contract breaches by former customers who switched to Linux.\n\nNovell contested SCO's claims, asserting that they retained the core copyrights and other rights over UNIX. This dispute led to the SCO v. Novell lawsuit, where a 2007 ruling favored Novell, affirming their ownership of the UNIX copyrights and ordering SCO to remit funds owed to Novell.\n\nDespite a partial overturn in 2009, a 2010 jury trial confirmed Novell's ownership of the UNIX copyrights. The SCO Group, under bankruptcy trustee Edward Cahn, continued legal action against IBM, but the lawsuit was dismissed in 2016."
