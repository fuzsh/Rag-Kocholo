She already has two children - son Jackson, aged six, and daughter Violet, aged one.

And on Tuesday Poppy Montgomery, 42, welcomed a third one, son Gus Monroe Deveraux, her rep told People on Thursday.

The father is the star's husband, Microsoft executive Shawn Sanford. The actress is best known for her two hit TV series Without A Trace and Unforgettable.

'Mom and baby are doing well,' the rep said.

Gus weighed in at 7lbs, 4oz. and measured 20.5 inches long.

The redheaded beauty, who shot to fame with her hit series Without A Trace, married Shawn in February at Disneyland, she revealed while on Live With Kelly And Michael.

Sanford is also father to daughter Haley and son Braydon from his previous marriage.

Poppy did not shared that she was pregnant again until July. 'Iâ€™m hoping to get all of the privileges now of a real pregnant person,' she joked. 'I want to be respected and given lots of royal treatment.'

The Australian-born beauty had son Jackson with actor Adam Kaufman, whom she met in 2005. He went on to play her boyfriend on Without A Trace.
