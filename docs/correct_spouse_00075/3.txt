Hollywood actress Poppy Montgomery, and her partner, Microsoft executive Shawn Sanford, welcomed their daughter Violet Grace Devereux on April 22. Violet Sanford was born at 7.57 am, weighed 3 kg (6lb 12oz), and measured 49.5 cm long. She joins big brother Jackson, aged 5, who is from Poppy’s previous relationship to actor Adam Kaufman.

Violet’s floral name continues a family tradition, for Poppy and her sisters are named after flowers too. Poppy’s family was covered as a celebrity sibset last year, and Poppy’s own name featured on the blog for Remembrance Day.
