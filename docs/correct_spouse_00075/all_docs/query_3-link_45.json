It incorporates 3D morphometric and comparative study of both living and fossil species, phylogenetic palaeobiology, quantitative studies of form-function relationships, and classic elements of palaeontology/systematics. His expertise is focused on Mesozoic and Late Palaeozoic groups including dinosaurs and other reptiles. His research group has addressed fundamental questions on the deep time evolutionary history of tetrapods more widely, including mammals, birds, crocodylians, turtles, lizards and their ancestors. It also finds links between the past and the present, using large datasets of extant species anatomy to test hypotheses of the ecology of extinct species such as dinosaurs.\n\nAdam Bly is a scientist, entrepreneur, and thought leader who has spent the past 15 years innovating at the nexus of science and society.

As a Black feminist anthropologist and ethnographer, her work uses sport to theorize race, kinship, care, and gender. In her first book project, under contract with University of California Press, Dr. Canada analyzes the performing athletic body to reveal how processes of injury, violence, and care impact the everyday lived experiences of Black college football players. An overall goal of her ethnographic research is to recenter not only what we consider to be anthropological knowledge, but also who we consider to be academic and public knowledge producers. Because she is committed to bringing current social, political, and popular culture events into the intellectual conversation, she founded and directs the HEARTS Lab. This innovative intellectual environment will engage scholars, fans, athletes, and writers to integrate academic and public audiences who are not usually in conversation about sport.

Drawing on a social design framework, his work explores how ideologies shape movements and vice versa. Through using performative and participatory methodologies, he positions design as a social practice. With this approach, he investigates how our bodies propagate, internalize and reproduce social norms. He proposes ways that this can be unlearned through new forms of pedagogy, activities and games that deconstruct group dynamics.\n\nSport and physical education have been his main field of research for the past five years. In this context, Gabriel develops alternative team sport games that reinvent sport as a queer pedagogy. With this method, he developed Multiform (2019) for the municipality of Rotterdam; an educational program for primary and secondary schools that contributes to inclusive physical education. More recently, Gabriel launched the Tournament of the Unknown (2022), a tournament series that reimagine togetherness.\n\nWorking towards a more inclusive future, his work infiltrates multiple layers of society through three specific sectors: education, culture and the sports industry.

From chasing monkeys in jungles and cities, to exploring the lives of our evolutionary ancestors, to examining human health, behavior, and diversity across the globe, Professor Fuentes is interested in both the big questions and the small details of what makes humans and our close relations tick. Earning his BA/BS in Anthropology and Zoology and his MA and PhD in Anthropology from UC Berkeley, he has conducted research across four continents, multiple species, and two-million years of human history. His current projects include exploring cooperation, creativity, and belief in human evolution, multispecies anthropologies, evolutionary theory and processes, and engaging race and racism.

As a survivor of the opioid crisis herself, and as an artist, Nan has particular stake in pressuring the Sackler family (the manufacturers of the opioid crisis) to be held accountable, and for museums to reject Sackler donations.\n\nLori Gruen is the William Griffin Professor of Philosophy and Professor of Feminist, Gender and Sexuality Studies and Science in Society at Wesleyan University where she coordinates Wesleyan Animal Studies.

Her current projects include exploring captivity and the ethical and political questions raised by carceral logics.\n\nBorn in 1978 in Paris, France, Camille Henrot now lives and works in New York City. The practice of French artist Camille Henrot moves seamlessly between film, painting, drawing, bronze, sculpture, and installation. Henrot draws upon references from literature, psychoanalysis, social media, cultural anthropology, self-help, and the banality of everyday life in order to question what it means to be both a private individual and a global subject. A 2013 fellowship at the Smithsonian Institute resulted in her film âGrosse Fatigue,â for which she was awarded the Silver Lion at the 55th Venice Biennale. She elaborated ideas from âGrosse Fatigueâ to conceive her acclaimed 2014 installation âThe Pale Foxâ at Chisenhale Gallery in London.

One day soon, he believes, the histories of philosophy and literature in premodern South Asia will more widely be seen as an integral part of the humanities. As they should be. His first book, Other Lives: Mind and World in Indian Buddhism, tracks ways in which one premodern Buddhist philosopher, Vasubandhu of Peshawar, used descriptions of experiences in dreams and non-human forms of life in thought experiments to rethink the relationship between mind and world. For more about Other Lives, which was written with a commitment to global philosophical outlook, with particular attention to a possibly connected ancient world, see this prÃ©cis and this review.\n\nJoan Kee is a professor in the History of Art at the University of Michigan. Her research focuses on how modern and contemporary artworks challenge our understandings of words like âworld,â âvalue,â âabstraction,â and âscale.â In Contemporary Korean Art: Tansaekhwa and the Urgency of Method (2013), Kee argued that close attention to process in the works of artists like Ha Chonghyun, Park Seobo, Lee Ufan, Yun Hyongkeun, and Kwon Young-woo set materiality against the imposition of meaning in authoritarian South Korea. Kee is especially interested in what might be called an applied art history, in which methods central to the disciplineâclose visual analysis in particularâoffer a framework for thinking about related cultural phenomena, from law to digital communication. Partly based on her experiences as a lawyer working in a range of areas from criminal defense to family mediation, Models of Integrity: Art and Law in Post-Sixties America (2019) explores how artists engaged with US law in ways that aimed to recuperate the integrity compromised by the very institutions supposedly entrusted with establishing standards of just conduct. Newly released, her book The Geometries of Afro Asia: Art Beyond Solidarity, asks how we might tell a history of art that begins with the global majority, spanning Asia, Africa, North America, and Europe. It sets at its center the worlds Black and Asian artists initiate through their work from roughly 1960 to the present.\n\nJosh Kline is a New York-based artist, who works primarily in sculpture, video, and installation, to create artworks and exhibitions that consider the ways in which our humanity has been transformed, commodified, and instruÂ­mentalized within neoliberal society. Examining the regimes of control to which the human body is increasingly subjectedâranging from governmental and corporate surveillance to the relentless pursuit of youthâKline addresses the erosion of boundaries between labor and leisure and the incursion of consumer culture into the most literally intimate aspects of life: blood, DNA, neurochemistry. In 2015, Kline began a major cycle of installation-based projects exploring the politics and economics of the 21st Century. Kline’s solo exhibition, Climate Change: Part One, will open at 47 Canal, New York on April 27, 2019. His work will also be included in the 2019 Whitney Biennial.\n\nJaamil Olawale Kosoko is a multi-spirited Nigerian American author, performance artist, and curator of Yoruba and Natchez descent originally from Detroit, MI. jaamilâs practice is conceptual, process-based, and interdisciplinary from within a corporeal modality. kosoko moves across the creative realms of live art performance, video, sculpture, and poetry using both cultural and academic idioms.
