        "text": "By Gill Pringle\n\nPictures: Jack Guy\n\nThe TV star is thrilled with her stunning new shape. She shares her diet and workout secrets.\n\nPoppy Montgomery is bringing her one-year-old baby boy home to Australia to spend his first Aussie summer with his proud grandparents.\n\nAnd son Jackson isn’t all she’ll be showing off — Poppy plans to reveal her fabulous post-baby bikini body, too.\n\nThe 36-year-old actress piled on 32kg during her pregnancy, but has slimmed down to a svelte 53kg after swearing off sugar since Jackson was born.\n\nThe Without A Trace star tells Woman’s Day the secrets of her new hot bod, her plans for another bub and why she’s thinking of marrying long-time partner Adam Kaufman, 35.\n\nWhat was your pre-pregnancy weight?\n\nI was 51kg, and my weight before I delivered was 82.5kg. How about that? But I felt good — I ate and ate…\n\nSo, you put on almost 32kg during pregnancy?\n\nYes, I was very, very free with my eating.\n\nAnd your weight now?\n\nAbout 53kg. I’m good with that — I’m not stressing to lose the extra five pounds [2.25kg]. I fluctuate, like I think everybody does … 51kg is actually too small for me and that normally means I’m stressed out, so 53kg is a great weight for me."
