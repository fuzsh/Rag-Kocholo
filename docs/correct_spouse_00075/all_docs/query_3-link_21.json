        "text": "Even in the most promising circumstances, the transition from vision to action presents formidable challenges. Research from Harvard Business School underscores this, revealing staggering failure rates of up to 90 percent in strategy and execution within today's business landscape. While scholars have long analyzed the underlying causes, one undeniable truth remains: vision alone rarely suffices. Recognizing this reality, our panel discussion brings together a distinguished group of leaders who will share their winning strategies for bridging the gap between vision and action to drive success. Throughout the session, our esteemed panelists will impart their expertise and acumen in crafting and owning a compelling, differentiating vision and provide the insight necessary to bring it to successful fruition. Through candid discussions and real-world examples, attendees will gain practical tools and inspiration to transform their own visions into tangible, thriving outcomes.\n\nModerator\n\nDina DiLorenzo\n\nPresident, Guggenheim Investments\n\nSpeakers\n\nDesiree Gruber\n\nCEO, Full Picture\n\nDawn Ostroff\n\nBoard of Directors, Mattel; Board of Directors, Paramount Global\n\nAnastasia Soare\n\nCEO, Anastasia Beverly Hills\n\nA lifetime of hard work should translate into a dignified and secure retirement in America, yet economists project that 40 percent of Americans will run out of money during retirement. Many factors perpetuate the US retirement crisis, including economic inequality and wage stagnation, the lack of access to employer-sponsored retirement savings plans, and soaring health-care expenses. As 2024 represents the apex of baby boomers reaching age 65, there’s an urgent need for bold leadership, innovation, and action to advance lifetime financial security. The need is especially pressing for younger generations who face daunting obstacles to early saving. Join this panel to hear what our nation’s top financial leaders are doing to “retire inequality” and ensure that all Americans can enjoy a healthy, financially secure future.\n\nModerator\n\nJennifer Ablan\n\nEditor-in-Chief, Pensions and Investments\n\nSpeakers\n\nThasunda Brown Duckett\n\nPresident and CEO, TIAA\n\nJohn Carter\n\nPresident and Chief Operating Officer, Nationwide Financial\n\nWill Fuller\n\nPresident and CEO, Transamerica\n\nPenny Pennington\n\nManaging Partner, Edward Jones\n\nFinancial Markets\n\nFor most of the post-WWII period, too many investors focused on returns without sufficient consideration for the social environment of their stakeholders. In recent decades, however, surging populism, increasing deglobalization attitudes, climate concerns, and widening income inequality have pushed investors to reexamine their approach. Demographic changes in the US and across the globe will drive the flow of consumers, talent, and capital over the next 50 years, presenting an opportunity for trillion-dollar wealth generation. How can inclusive capitalism ensure ballast for returns and reduce risk in uncertain times? Does an investing style that considers these factors stabilize returns in the long run? Our expert panelists will present options to demonstrate how investors can negotiate political and geopolitical uncertainty and continue to ensure long-term viability for their investments.\n\nModerator\n\nTroy Duffie\n\nDirector, Financial Markets, Milken Institute\n\nSpeakers\n\nNisha Biswal\n\nDeputy CEO, US International Development Finance Corporation\n\nRoger Ferguson\n\nImmediate Past President and CEO, TIAA\n\nCarla Harris\n\nSenior Client Advisor, Morgan Stanley\n\nMartin Nesbitt\n\nSenior Partner, Co-Chairman, and Co-CEO, The Vistria Group\n\nRegions & Developing Markets Diversity, Equity, & Inclusion Capital Access & Economic Opportunity\n\nExperts in a vast field of opinions will explore the complex interplay between higher education, skills-based hiring, and the sometimes elusive value of a college degree in today's workforce. Join our panelists as they delve into the ongoing debate about the relevance of traditional degrees in a job market that increasingly emphasizes practical skills and competencies. They will address the emerging trend toward alternative skill-building pathways and assess how individuals can navigate the range of choices to align their educational experiences with their career goals. A critical factor in any decision: How are US college students and alumni tackling student debt? Listen to what university presidents, corporate executives, and government officials must contribute to this broader discourse on the changing landscape of higher education, as well as the multifaceted world of skills, degrees, and employability.\n\nModerator\n\nJeff Selingo\n\nAuthor and Journalist\n\nSpeakers\n\nEric Gertler\n\nExecutive Chairman and CEO, U.S. News & World Report\n\nDaphne Kis\n\nPresident, WorldQuant University\n\nMichael Roth\n\nPresident, Wesleyan University\n\nBen Sasse\n\nPresident, University of Florida\n\nDiversity, Equity, & Inclusion Human Capital, Jobs, & Education\n\nAfrica has the fastest growing, youngest population of any continent, and for this rising population set, it is second nature to turn to technology to solve the continent’s most pressing problems. Moreover, the wealth of free online coding boot camps, robotics lessons, and lectures is having a big impact, inspiring careers and seeding ideas for start-ups across Africa. According to ILO’s Global Employment Trends for Youth 2020: Africa, “...Africa is the only region where the youth bulge will continue to grow … presenting both an opportunity to reap the demographic dividend and an imminent …threat to social cohesion as well as massive migration in search of opportunities if appropriate policies are not implemented to harness the dividend.” With grit, resilience, creativity, and passion, Africa’s youth embraces the challenge to move their continent forward and create a better tomorrow collectively. How can the global community—policymakers, investors, corporates, and consumers—help enable this spirit for everyone’s benefit?\n\nModerator\n\nDan Keeler\n\nFounder and Editor, Frontier Markets News\n\nSpeakers\n\nRamadan Ameen\n\nCEO, Americas and Central Asia, Ubuntu Global Holdings\n\nMaya Horgan Famodu\n\nFounder and Managing Director, Ingressive Capital\n\nYolanda Mabuto\n\nManaging Director Africa, Divaine Growth Solutions\n\nWalter Pacheco\n\nCEO, Angolan Stock Exchange\n\nFred Swaniker\n\nFounder and CEO, Sand Technologies\n\nRegions & Developing Markets Capital Access & Economic Opportunity Human Capital, Jobs, & Education AI, Innovation, & Technology\n\nHarnessing the body’s own immune system has revolutionized the treatment of several refractory cancers, from melanoma and lymphoma to certain lung and liver cancers. In 2018, Drs. James Allison, US, and Tasuku Honjo, Japan, shared the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine for discoveries that led to the development of cancer therapy by a process termed inhibition of negative immune regulation, which enables a patient’s own immune system to block encroachment by certain malignancies. To date, immunotherapies have been shown effective in many cases of melanoma and about two dozen other cancer types. The armamentarium of immune therapies has also grown to include novel therapeutic mechanisms that may have antiviral applications. Expert panelists will range beyond the current treatment horizon to cover the next act in immunotherapy, including mRNA vaccines, cell-based approaches such as TIL cell and CAR-T therapy, and what these developments mean for patients, investors, the life-sciences industry, and the outlook for cancer treatments.\n\nModerator\n\nMarc Hurlbert\n\nCEO, Melanoma Research Alliance\n\nSpeakers\n\nGina Carithers\n\nPresident, Prostate Cancer Foundation\n\nFriedrich Graf Finckenstein\n\nChief Medical Officer, Iovance Biotherapeutics\n\nAnusha Kalbasi\n\nAssociate Professor, Robert L. and Mary Ellenburg Endowed Faculty Scholar, Department of Radiation Oncology, Stanford University School of Medicine\n\nConnie Pfeiffer\n\nVice President of Medical Affairs, Immunocore\n\nSunil Verma\n\nSenior Vice President, Global Medical Affairs, AstraZeneca\n\nHealth & Medical Research\n\nIn 2023, organizations spent an estimated $188 billion globally on cybersecurity, and that figure is expected to rise to almost $215 billion in 2024. Cybercriminals are advancing quickly, and their attacks are becoming so sophisticated that cybersecurity experts are struggling to keep up, let alone get ahead of the next critical threat. As technology advances, and the data of our financial, tech, and government institutions becomes more and more valuable, how will cybersecurity leaders across these sectors work together to counter bad actors? Join us and our fellow thought leaders to discuss how high the stakes really are, and what they are doing to build institutional resilience and mitigate risk.\n\nModerator\n\nDmitri Alperovitch\n\nChairman, Silverado Policy Accelerator; Author, \"World on the Brink: How America Can Beat China in the Race for the Twenty-First Century\"\n\nSpeakers\n\nJen Easterly\n\nDirector, Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency\n\nMichael Greenwald\n\nGlobal Head, Financial Innovation and Digital Assets, Amazon Web Services\n\nRob Silvers\n\nUnder Secretary for Policy, US Department of Homeland Security\n\nSecurity & Risk AI, Innovation, & Technology\n\nJapan remains one of the most innovative and pioneering forces in technology, business, and finance in the world today. From cutting-edge electronics, robotics, and AI to sustainable and climate-linked investments, Japan, with Tokyo as its epicenter, has pushed the boundaries of what's possible and shaped the development of industries around the world. Alongside recent monetary and public policy shifts, Japan is gearing up for wider industrial, financial, and social reforms that leaders hope will drive a new growth paradigm for the country, while working to address structural and cyclical challenges. In this private session, we gather top leaders to discuss the business and investment opportunities in Tokyo and Japan and examine how companies can capitalize on the transformations underway to unlock new investment flows and build new partnerships.\n\nOpening Remarks\n\nLaura Deal Lacey\n\nExecutive Vice President, MI International, Milken Institute\n\nModerator\n\nHiromichi Mizuno\n\nSenior Advisor, Milken Institute\n\nSpeakers\n\nYuriko Koike\n\nGovernor of Tokyo\n\nHirowaka Murakami\n\nChief Investment Officer, Yamauchi-No.10 Family Office\n\nHiroshi Ozeki\n\nPresident and CEO, Nissay Asset Management Corporation\n\nFinancial Markets Business & Industry Regions & Developing Markets\n\nAfter the COP28 agreement to phase down oil and gas, all eyes are on corporations as they reassess and revamp their net zero strategies. The climate tech sector continues to attract first-time investors, underscoring the market’s staying power. As industries decarbonize, what are the challenges and opportunities in leveraging innovative financing instruments to stimulate private investment in sustainable solutions? What is the role of the capital markets in both spurring development of these technologies and supporting companies as they adopt and deploy them at scale? The Paris Summit for a New Global Financing Pact renewed financial commitments to support developing countries’ emissions targets. In light of this renewal, what systemic changes are needed to facilitate a sustainable business transition globally?\n\nModerator\n\nLeslie Kaufman\n\nSenior Reporter, Bloomberg\n\nSpeakers\n\nRavina Advani\n\nHead, Low Carbon Transition Group Americas, BNP Paribas\n\nKyle Baker\n\nHead of Energy Transition, Americas Investment Banking, Jefferies\n\nMatthieu Courtecuisse\n\nCEO, Sia Partners\n\nMatt Harris\n\nFounding Partner, Global Infrastructure Partners\n\nConnor Teskey\n\nPresident, Brookfield Asset Management; CEO Renewable Power and Transition, Brookfield\n\nFinancial Markets Sustainability & Environment\n\nThe pandemic accelerated the transformation of the workplace and elevated the opportunity for employers to assume a critical role in workforce and community health. Employers are finding a voice on critical issues such as promoting employees’ mental health and wellbeing. This accelerated redesign also illustrated the importance of a “whole person\" approach, coupled with empathetic leadership, to influence productivity, enhance engagement, and effectively address the needs of five generations in the workforce. This invite-only discussion will focus on the emergent models of learning and innovation to optimize health for employees and organizations. Vital aspects to explore include the investments needed to pave the way for a healthy, engaged, and productive workforce. Fostering a resilient workforce is not only the right thing to do, it also makes business sense.\n\nModerator\n\nEsther Krofah\n\nExecutive Vice President, MI Health, Milken Institute\n\nSpeakers\n\nPatrick Conway\n\nCEO, Optum Rx\n\nJoneigh S.

For many, valuations fell to levels not seen in a decade, while investments made globally also sank by a quarter. Yet, against the backdrop of an improving macroeconomic environment, AI’s growing influence, and with over USD 300 billion in dry powder waiting to be deployed in the US alone, the industry is poised for a pivot. This begs the essential question for investors: Will mega-round financing continue to wane, with managers increasingly prioritizing smaller, more profitable and strategically positioned firms? We will explore which sectors will outperform and how trends will differ in developed and emerging economies. We will consider the government investing to diversify and develop local economies, including a discussion of Qatar’s recent announcement of a USD 1 billion fund for its national start-up and VC ecosystem. Join us as we chart the path forward for venture capital and the role that managers can play in emerging markets.\n\nModerator\n\nNicole Valentine\n\nDirector, FinTech, Milken Institute\n\nSpeakers\n\nMohammed Al Sowaidi\n\nChief Investment Officer, Region Americas, QIA\n\nSaleha Osmani\n\nManaging Director, Falconbridge Advisors\n\nJack Selby\n\nManaging Director, Thiel Capital\n\nFinancial Markets Business & Industry Regions & Developing Markets\n\nWe assume that the longer and harder we work, the more we will be able to generate. Performance optimization research has debunked this out-of-date myth. To produce the highest quality product, we need to balance work with rest and downtime. This workshop will explore nature's cycles, including our own, through a yogic lens. Learning to ride our individual circadian rhythms optimizes our performance quantity and quality. We will learn a number of micro-rest and nervous system reset practices that can be done anywhere throughout the day. You will come away from this presentation with tools to help you reach your highest potential—including a permission slip to rest.\n\nSpeaker\n\nSarah Ezrin\n\nYoga Teacher, E-RYT 500\n\nDisagreement and conflict resolution are foundational elements of the United States’ system of governance; divergent views on federalism, checks and balances, the separation of powers, and other such norms have been present since the founding of the country. While there is partisan division on many critical issues facing the US, broad consensus in some areas continues to lead to the enactment of bipartisan policies. This panel will examine how political leadership can play a role in breaking through the divisive noise and what can be accomplished as we lead up to 2025 and beyond.\n\nPolicy, Politics, & Regulation\n\nVisual storytelling is one of the most powerful media for bearing witness, documenting history, and inciting change. From the early 20th century, technology and public interest have driven talented photographers and documentarians—think of Robert Capa, Margaret Bourke-White, Henri Cartier-Bresson, Dorothea Lange—to document momentous times such as the Great Depression, the World Wars, and other historic phenomena. Photography helps connect the personal with the global, the profane with the sacred, the joyful with the painful. Moving images transport us: first entering our homes as tv news bulletins, then via 24/7 cable news, and now with our devices on a constant loop. Photojournalism creates opportunities to sharpen awareness, protect communities, preserve habitat and conserve resources, and document vital cultures. Join our conversation with acclaimed visual storytellers who will share iconic photographic images with an eye toward hope and healing.\n\nModerator\n\nJimmie Briggs\n\nPrincipal, Justice and Equity, Skoll Foundation; Writer and Journalist\n\nSpeakers\n\nAndrea Bruce\n\nPhotographer, National Geographic\n\nScott Harrison\n\nFounder and CEO, charity:water\n\nYunghi Kim\n\nPhotojournalist, Contact Press Images\n\nEli Reed\n\nPhotographer and Photojournalist, Magnum Photos\n\nSustainability & Environment Society & Culture Philanthropy & Social Impact\n\nInnovation has never taken place in a vacuum: inventors and entrepreneurs have always had patrons and providers of the infrastructure needed to dream up new technologies and bring new products to market. The internet might never have been possible without the Pentagon; DNA was discovered in a Cambridge University lab; and Bell Labs remains famous for the technological advances that it spawned. The sociology of innovation—how we can best arrange people and platforms to encourage breakthroughs—has become a hot topic, examining the ideal role of government, corporate and university spinouts, incentives and rewards, and the other factors needed to spur economic growth in the most efficient, sustainable way. In this panel we bring together innovators, policymakers, public intellectuals, and new organizations to help us understand how genius should best be organized to benefit us all.\n\nModerator\n\nSimon Radford\n\nDirector, European Policy and Programming, Milken Institute\n\nSpeakers\n\nJano Costard\n\nChallenge Officer, SPRIND\n\nSteffi Czerny\n\nCo-Founder and Curator, DLD Conferences\n\nThomas Fink\n\nDirector, London Institute of Mathematical Sciences\n\nAlbert Read\n\nAuthor, \"The Imagination Muscle\"; Former Managing Director, Conde Nast Britain\n\nBusiness & Industry AI, Innovation, & Technology\n\nEmerging markets and developing economies (EMDEs) are processing a new paradigm as the global economy grapples with protectionist legislation affecting supply chains and trade alliances that prioritize geopolitical interest. Questions loom large regarding pivotal electoral outcomes and market access between the world's two largest economies, as persistent slow growth from China runs concurrently with a rise in productivity from India. These complexities are compounded by persistently higher interest rates and the impacts of inflation—navigating them successfully is paramount if EMDEs are to achieve sustainable growth. Despite these challenges, many developing economies are witnessing a productivity spike driven in part by shifting demographics and population growth. How can EMDEs steer a path through this complex set of macro conditions? Where are investors seeing opportunity globally, and what factors are they assessing to make investment decisions?\n\nModerator\n\nAngela Rodell\n\nFounder, Rodell Consulting\n\nSpeakers\n\nAnthony Bisegna\n\nExecutive Vice President, Head of State Street Global Markets, State Street\n\nAndrew Cross\n\nChief Financial Officer, Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank\n\nKomal Sri-Kumar\n\nFounder and President, Sri-Kumar Global Strategies, Inc.\n\nYana Watson Kakar\n\nManaging Director and Head of Americas, CDPQ\n\nFinancial Markets\n\nAfter many years of prosperity, growth, high valuations, and unlimited dry powder, private markets now face serious challenges from geopolitical uncertainty, inflation, and rising interest rates. What are the consequences and who are the benefactors of stricter market policies and regulations on the global flows of capital and returns? How can GPs and LPs collaborate and co-invest more effectively, and with greater transparency, while incorporating impact into their risk-adjusted return analyses? How are asset managers adapting their strategies to navigate evolving market conditions and capitalize on emerging opportunities within private markets? This roundtable of leading asset owners will be an opportunity for frank exchange about the future of the industry.\n\nOpening Remarks\n\nPetra Freddi\n\nManaging Director, Europe, Milken Institute\n\nModerator\n\nScott Hart\n\nCEO, StepStone Group\n\nSpeakers\n\nJanne Gustafsson\n\nSenior Portfolio Manager, Structured Credit, Ilmarinen\n\nElena Manola-Bonthond\n\nChief Investment Officer, CERN Pension Fund\n\nAnton Orlich\n\nManaging Investment Director, Private Equity, CalPERS\n\nWil S. Warren\n\nPartner and President, Lexington Partners\n\nWhen nonprofit organizations and philanthropists set out on their philanthropic journey, they are seeking to generate impact or a high rate of return on their investment. However, the impact generated through the deployment of traditional vehicles of gifts and grants is not always tangible or defined. The integration of venture philanthropy and impact investments into a philanthropic portfolio provides philanthropists with the opportunity to generate alpha across both financial and impact metrics. During this private roundtable discussion, we will hear from leading venture philanthropists on how they structure their investment practices to enhance their philanthropy.\n\nModerator\n\nMelissa Stevens\n\nExecutive Vice President, MI Philanthropy, Milken Institute\n\nSpeakers\n\nMatt Onek\n\nPresident and CEO, Mission Investors Exchange\n\nAlice Pomponio\n\nManaging Director, BrightEdge, American Cancer Society\n\nBahiyah Robinson\n\nFounder and Chief Executive, VC Include\n\nLisa Sobrato Sonsini\n\nFounding Board Chair, Sobrato Family Foundation\n\nPhilanthropy & Social Impact\n\nDid you know that a regular practice of the brief, contemplative mental pause can recharge, energize, and optimize your mind-body complex more deeply than sleep? Discover how you can benefit from quickly quieting your mind. Reduce stress at the cellular level, so you can remember and reconnect with who you really are at the core—not the overwhelmed, over-functioning you…the real you. Tapping into the power of the mental pause will make it possible for you to accomplish more with less stress and a greater sense of calm.\n\nSpeaker\n\nRajshree Patel\n\nCoach and Self Awareness Trainer, Art of Living Foundation\n\nTalk of trouble in the private equity industry is unrelenting. High costs of capital, a gloomy outlook, and a lackluster IPO market have threatened private equity investors’ ability to deliver favorable IRRs and execute transformational investments. Yet some investors have continued quietly toiling away. Poised between worries about buying into a recession, on one hand, and fading recession risks, on the other, capital-constrained environments have created opportunities for those with dry powder to deploy selectively. Faced with the undoubted current market headwinds, who is still deploying dry powder right now? How will managers continue to generate returns for their LPs, deliver value across their portfolios, and navigate structural uncertainty in the years ahead? What core tenets in their investment strategies have they remained steadfast to?\n\nModerator\n\nMark Thierfelder\n\nCo-Chair and Partner, Dechert\n\nSpeakers\n\nJoe Baratta\n\nGlobal Head of Private Equity, Blackstone\n\nAnne-Marie Fink\n\nChief Investment Officer, Private Markets and Funds Alpha, State of Wisconsin Investment Board\n\nPatrick Healy\n\nCEO, Hellman & Friedman\n\nJonathan D.

From crafting innovative growth strategies and developing modern-day workforces, to meeting evolving customer expectations while navigating ongoing global macroeconomic uncertainties—and now, the new world of generative AI. What are the ways in which corporations and industries are developing, experimenting, and learning with generative AI to protect and benefit businesses, their customers, employees, and broader society? What are the essential leadership elements and strategies that CEOs employ to propel their companies towards success—particularly in an era characterized by disruptive and emerging technologies?

From border security and immigration to the defense of democracy and US policy choices for navigating geo-political turbulence, the issues driving the 2024 elections are causing significant shifts in partisan allegiances and driving political fragmentation in new ways. Join political experts as they discuss the critical issues that will reverberate across the partisan divide, impacting voters in battleground states crucial to determining the Senate and House majorities—and delivering the electoral votes for the presidency.\n\nModerator\n\nGerard Baker\n\nEditor-at-Large, The Wall Street Journal\n\nSpeakers\n\nKellyanne Conway\n\n#1 NYT Best Selling Author; President of KAConsulting LLC; Former Senior Counselor to the President\n\nVan Jones\n\nSocial Entrepreneur; Bestselling Author; CNN Host; and Founder, Dream Machine Innovation Lab\n\nChris Liddell\n\nAuthor, \"Year Zero: The Five-Year Presidency\"; Former White House Assistant to the President and Deputy Chief of Staff\n\nJim Messina\n\nCEO, The Messina Group; former Obama 2012 Campaign Manager, White House Deputy Chief of Staff\n\nPaul Ryan\n\n54th Speaker of the U.S. House of Representatives; Vice Chairman, Teneo; Partner, Solamere Capital\n\nPolicy, Politics, & Regulation\n\nThe private credit market has grown remarkably: from $875 billion in 2020 to approximately $1.4 trillion at the start of 2023. It is now projected to reach $2.3 trillion by 2027. Although mega funds contributed almost half of new capital raised, traditional lenders and smaller institutions have also entered the market in search of the ideal targets. The abundance of capital supply has thus far been met by the demand of corporate borrowers seeking breathing room amid high costs and stricter lending by banks, but it remains to be seen whether supply will outpace demand. How are private credit investors, big and small, finding the right deals? What roles can the banks still play? Finally, how long can we expect this golden age of private credit to last?\n\nModerator\n\nJohn Bowman\n\nPresident and Incoming CEO, CAIA Association\n\nSpeakers\n\nJeffrey Aronson\n\nManaging Principal and Co-Founder, Centerbridge Partners\n\nMarianna Fassinotti\n\nHead of Private Credit, The D.

Over the past decade, these factors have expanded to include climate risks like natural disasters as well as social risks like migration and labor. A 2023 FTSE Russell survey of 350 asset owners globally indicated that approximately eighty percent have implemented or are considering implementing sustainability considerations in their investment strategies. More than half say they are responding to demands from stakeholders and/or are adopting a strategy to mitigate long-term risks. Between the SEC’s regulations requiring publicly listed companies to report climate-related financial impact and the EU’s climate disclosure requirements, how are institutional investors shifting their investment priorities and allocations to meet fiduciary duties while also addressing climate and social risks? Is the current ESG framework still sufficient? How are investors navigating a political landscape that is now more critical of ESG integration? Are asset owners uncovering opportunities to maintain diverse and balanced portfolios?\n\nModerator\n\nCara Williams\n\nGlobal Head of ESG, Climate and Sustainability, Mercer\n\nSpeakers\n\nAhmed Saeed Al Calily\n\nChief Strategy and Risk Officer, Mubadala Investment Company\n\nHershel Harper\n\nChief Investment Officer, UAW Retiree Medical Benefits Trust\n\nDerek Rozycki\n\nExecutive Director, Head of Responsible Investing, Mubadala Investment Company\n\nAndrew Siwo\n\nHead of Sustainable Investments and Climate Solutions, New York State Common Retirement Fund\n\nCarine Smith Ihenacho\n\nChief Governance and Compliance Officer, Norges Bank Investment Management\n\nRossitsa Stoyanova\n\nChief Investment Officer, Investment Management Corporation of Ontario\n\nFinancial Markets Sustainability & Environment\n\nChildren today are spending more time on screens than ever before. According to the Kaiser Family Foundation, youth spend an average of more than seven hours per day engaged in screen-based entertainment, totaling up to 114 full days spent in front of screens annually. This session will delve into the mental health implications of digital media consumption on young people, spanning from early developmental stages to the cultivation of critical thinking skills amidst the proliferation of misinformation online. Panelists will explore how digital media can serve both as an educational tool and a contributor to mental health challenges such as body dysmorphia, anxiety, and suicidal ideation. The discussion will also address the role of policy in creating safer digital environments for youth and how protective measures and proactive interventions can bolster youth mental health. Through this conversation, we aim to shed light on the complex interplay between digital media and youth mental health while advocating for strategies to mitigate potential harm and promote positive well-being.\n\nModerator\n\nSpeakers\n\nKenneth Cole\n\nFounder, The Mental Health Coalition\n\nJennifer Siebel Newsom\n\nFirst Partner of California\n\nAshwin Vasan\n\nHealth Commissioner, City of New York\n\nSherrie Westin\n\nPresident and Interim CEO, Sesame Workshop\n\nHealth & Medical Research AI, Innovation, & Technology\n\nExtreme weather and oil and gas subsidies are costing taxpayers billions of dollars a year, money that could be spent to save human lives, protect property and infrastructure, and fund greenhouse gas mitigation projects. Re-calibrating climate finance is essential if we’re to scale up truly catalytic capital deployment in the next decade. We wouldn’t be starting from scratch. New investment priorities focused on net zero, nature, and national debt offer opportunities for focused action in the Global North. Rising demands in the Global South for regional strategies and support for de-risking the project pipeline will succeed if the climate finance community can re-tool institutional mechanisms from the bottom up. This private session will examine the state of current churn on climate finance and review a new Milken Institute strategy document for effective action from 2025-2035.\n\nModerator\n\nDan Carol\n\nSenior Director, MI Finance, Milken Institute\n\nSpeakers\n\nJ.

The decision has reignited contentious discussions surrounding race-conscious admissions policies, exposing deep-rooted societal divisions and raising critical questions about fairness, meritocracy, and the pursuit of diversity in educational institutions and in the workplace. While some view the decision as a victory for equal treatment and merit-based selection, others argue that it undermines efforts to address systemic inequalities and perpetuates exclusionary practices based on race or sexuality. This far-reaching discussion will take a data-driven approach to access what has worked and what hasn’t in DEI efforts.\n\nModerator\n\nRichard Ditizio\n\nCEO, Milken Institute\n\nSpeakers\n\nBill Ackman\n\nFounder and CEO, Pershing Square Capital Management L.P.\n\nJohn Hope Bryant\n\nChairman and CEO, Operation HOPE, Inc.\n\nDina DiLorenzo\n\nPresident, Guggenheim Investments\n\nJarvis V.

Yet 70 percent of that growth (approximately US$6.2 trillion) is disproportionately attributable to just six American technology companies. With the number of private equity companies in the US outnumbering public companies twofold, where do investors look for diversification? Despite potential future rate cuts, the cost of capital will likely remain high. Where are investors doubling down for continued growth? What’s left in veteran investors’ playbooks?

Digitalization has renewed opportunities for growth and inflation is cooling. Yet the cost of capital will remain high for the foreseeable future and the US IPO market is still waiting for its rebound. On the ground, consumer and business trends are changing in real time, keeping business leaders on their toes.

The number of women running Fortune 500 companies has reached an all-time high of nearly 11 percent, but industries critical to global economic success—such as STEM, trade, infrastructure, and finance—are still heavily lacking in female representation and entrepreneurship.

Workforce health and wellness are at the heart of achieving and maintaining organizational success. With almost half the population obtaining health insurance through the workplace, employers have the unique opportunity to drive innovation while improving their communities. Though a healthier workforce ultimately creates a healthier economy, employers are challenged with containing healthcare costs, especially with growing chronic disease rates. Employers are looking beyond traditional offerings, providing holistic benefits that support whole-person health. The public sector is positioned to partner across sectors while driving healthcare cost containment, caregiving, and housing policies to support a resilient workforce. This panel will examine how employers can support employee well-being through value-driven, whole-person care that treats both physical and mental health equally. How are companies making employee well-being a business priority? Where can investment drive innovation? How might the private and public sectors partner together to enhance workforce engagement while improving health outcomes?\n\nModerator\n\nNicholas St. Fleur\n\nScience Reporter, Associate Editorial Director of Events and Host of Color Code Podcast, STAT\n\nSpeakers\n\nShereef Elnahal\n\nUnder Secretary for Health, US Department of Veterans Affairs\n\nTracy Layney\n\nExecutive Vice President and Chief Human Resources Officer, Levi Strauss & Co.\n\nDan Mendelson\n\nCEO, Morgan Health, JPMorgan Chase & Co.\n\nJohnny Taylor, Jr.\n\nPresident and CEO, Society for Human Resource Management (SHRM)\n\nBusiness & Industry Health & Medical Research\n\nFaster and more profoundly than ever, AI is on the cusp of transforming finance, manufacturing, retail, entertainment, healthcare, warfare, and every sector in between. In the face of these changes, businesses need a coherent AI-centered strategy, a retrained or upskilled workforce, and transparent communication. How can public and private sectors collaborate to ensure an AI future that helps more than it harms? Given market trends and ethical considerations, what risks and rewards exist in the applications of AI and investment in it?

The expansion of the EU’s disclosure requirements through its Corporate Sustainability Reporting Directive (CSRD) last year introduced mandated third-party verifications and a phased implementation timeline for non-EU entities operating in the EU. The US Securities and Exchange Commission has taken similar actions, requiring publicly listed companies to report climate-related risks to their businesses along with Scope 1 and Scope 2 emissions for larger companies. How will divergences in ESG reporting standards affect international investment activity and the competitive landscape for companies with a global presence? What are the potential challenges and solutions to standardizing third-party verifications across regions? How can investors leverage ESG disclosures to identify new investment opportunities and achieve higher returns, particularly within industries with significant long-term ESG risks and impact?\n\nModerator\n\nWendy Cromwell\n\nVice Chair; Director, Sustainable Investment, Wellington Management\n\nSpeakers\n\nDaniel Fibiger\n\nHead of Global Sustainability and President, Gap Foundation\n\nJingdong Hua\n\nVice-Chair, International Sustainability Standards Board (ISSB)\n\nLinda-Eling Lee\n\nFounding Director and Head, MSCI Sustainability Institute\n\nMark Uyeda\n\nCommissioner, US Securities and Exchange Commission\n\nSustainability & Environment\n\nAI offers enormous potential to accelerate biomedical research and improve care delivery.

By 2050, 90 cities in Africa will be home to over a million people, and the continent will hold six of the world’s mega cities—those with more than 10 million residents. The continent’s median is age today is 19, and by 2050, one in four people on the planet will be African. These demographics, coupled with the urgent need for healthcare-, education- and climate-focused investments, are signals that Africa is a region of opportunity, ready for investors’ capital. From infrastructure, agriculture, supply chains and minerals to entertainment, sports, and financial technology, Africa is awash in ambition and potential.\n\nIn Africa and abroad, how can policymakers, businesses, investors and development partners best come together to seize the upside of this demographic story? What is needed to foster a vibrant private sector in Africa, where innovators can access reliable financial markets and tap into the continent’s tremendous potential? What are the most pressing priorities, to help ensure that growth is sustainable and inclusive, and that employment opportunities are unlocked in the world’s youngest and fastest-growing countries? Please join us for a private session focused on the world’s next major economic powerhouse and which will gather the Milken Institute’s Global Financial Scholars as well as inaugural members of the Milken Institute's Africa Leaders Business Council - corporate leaders committed to supporting the Milken Institute's efforts to accelerate these opportunities across Africa.

This is an opportunity to exchange ideas and break down silos between investors from pension plans, endowments and foundations, sovereign wealth funds, insurance companies, state and corporate treasuries, and single-family offices. Drawing on collective knowledge, CIOs and CEOs from around the world will consider the most compelling ways to navigate the changing macroeconomic landscape and address the most pressing questions these corporate officers face. How are asset owners accounting for risk in their portfolios? In what ways are allocators adjusting their investment strategies to account for a persistent higher-interest–rate environment? How are investment offices considering the use of artificial intelligence? What role are upcoming elections and changing demographics likely to play in investment strategies? How are investors negotiating geopolitical risk and geographical diversification?\n\nOpening Remarks\n\nErin Lubitz\n\nAssociate Director, Business and Program Development, Milken Institute\n\nWelcome Remarks\n\nMichael Milken\n\nChairman, Milken Institute\n\nSpeakers\n\nChristopher Ailman\n\nChief Investment Officer, Investments, California State Teachers' Retirement System\n\nJase Auby\n\nChief Investment Officer, Teacher Retirement System of Texas\n\nKim Lew\n\nCEO, Columbia Investment Management Company\n\nFinancial Markets\n\nFrom finding recovery since the COVID19 pandemic to geopolitical outbreaks, investors have rolled with the punches stemming from volatile conditions across market cycles. Despite signs of resilience and optimism, global growth forecasts have been uneven across emerging markets, developing economies, and advanced economies. Foundational tenets of neoliberalism have repeatedly been called into question amid intensifying geopolitical tensions and unrest, such as G10 interest rate coordination, comparative advantage-based trade, and supranational corporate interests prioritizing global supply chains over geopolitical interests. What are the broader economic and market implications of increased geo-economic fragmentation? Is there still room for multilateralism against such a fragmented backdrop? What remains of challenges faced by policy makers, corporate executives, and asset managers alike? Are we experiencing a recurrence of history or rewriting the chapter of our times?\n\nModerator\n\nDavid Westin\n\nAnchor, Wall Street Week, Bloomberg\n\nSpeakers\n\nAndrew Junkin\n\nChief Investment Officer, Virginia Retirement System\n\nKaren Karniol-Tambour\n\nCo-Chief Investment Officer, Bridgewater Associates, LP\n\nRohit Sipahimalani\n\nChief Investment Officer, Temasek\n\nMax Stone\n\nExecutive Committee Member, The D. E. Shaw Group\n\nFinancial Markets\n\nCapital is flocking to alternative asset classes as a hedge against market volatility. Infrastructure and natural assets, for instance, have emerged as stable investment opportunities with reliable appreciation over time. Efforts to combat rapid warming of the planet and manage an efficient global transition will require investment in areas beyond wind and solar. And as the AI data boom ushers in a new era of computational power and connectivity, concerns about its growing environmental footprint have arisen. Cutting-edge climate-smart technologies, resilience projects, and nature-based solutions can accelerate progress towards decarbonization and adaptation goals as well as deliver long-term value to investors. To build these asset classes truly to scale, however, industry needs public sector funding and policy incentives to realign the economy after a century of oil and gas subsidies. Capital markets have a significant role in future-proofing their portfolios and, in turn, the planet. Can targeted private investment and advocacy within portfolio companies scale up promising climate solutions in alternative asset classes and sectors? Because public capital is limited, what policies or paradigm shifts could enable essential climate adaptation technologies? How can companies continue toward a sustainable transition amid the growing importance of resilience and adaptation?\n\nModerator\n\nLeslie Kaufman\n\nSenior Reporter, Bloomberg\n\nSpeakers\n\nRobbie Diamond\n\nPresident and CEO, SAFE\n\nOscar Fahlgren\n\nChief Investment Officer, Mubadala Capital\n\nChristopher James\n\nFounder and Chief Investment Officer, Engine No. 1\n\nJennifer Pryce\n\nPresident and CEO, Calvert Impact\n\nJason Scott\n\nEntrepreneur in Residence and Partner, Spring Lane Capital; Co-Chair, CREO Syndicate\n\nSustainability & Environment\n\nWe live in a world that often values output, busyness, and economic growth over subjective outcomes such as human joy. This panel explores the sustainability of economic growth from the perspective of happiness, discussing ways in which employers, investors, and communities can shift their approach to growth to achieve long-term, lasting human well-being. We take a scientific approach to happiness, incorporating lessons from economics, psychiatry, and neuroscience to discuss concerns such as sustainability, mental health, and societal changes resulting in growing loneliness and isolation. This panel will explore practical changes to our definition of outcomes and success, as well as daily strategies we can use to achieve a meaningful life and sustainable happiness as individuals and communities.\n\nModerator\n\nMaggie Switek\n\nSenior Director, Research, Milken Institute\n\nSpeakers\n\nJen Fisher\n\nHuman Sustainability Leader, Deloitte\n\nHal Hershfield\n\nProfessor at UCLA Anderson School of Management, University of California, Los Angeles\n\nMariano Rojas\n\nProfessor of Economics, Tecnológico Nacional de México\n\nRobert Waldinger\n\nProfessor of Psychiatry, Harvard Medical School; Director, Harvard Study of Adult Development, Massachusetts General Hospital\n\nSustainability & Environment Society & Culture\n\nThe world, we're told, faces a “polycrisis” - concurrent environmental, economic, social, public health and geopolitical crises, whose complex and compounding relationships are poorly understood but affect us nonetheless. Developing and emerging markets, in particular, are gripped by social unrest, climate change, geopolitical tensions, and demographic and public health pressures. Governments, investors, and the donor community struggle to effectively determine how to tackle these interlocking challenges. Artificial intelligence holds the potential for us to better forecast polycrisis consequences (such as social or economic unrest); more precisely identify location-specific drivers; and design smarter, holistic interventions that mitigate risks and more effectively advance inclusive development. At the same time, AI also poses a range of significant risks, including potential perpetuation (and exaggeration) of bias, with discriminatory and destabilizing outcomes. With implications for policymakers, donors and investors alike, this panel will illuminate AI's advances – and potential risks – as a tool for bolstering resilience and inclusive growth in developing and emerging markets.\n\nModerator\n\nNicol Turner Lee\n\nSenior Fellow, Governance Studies and Director, Center for Technology Innovation, Brookings Institution\n\nSpeakers\n\nJalak Jobanputra\n\nFounder and Managing Partner, Future\\Perfect Ventures\n\nChris Mahony\n\nCo-Founder and CEO, Peloria\n\nRoya Rahmani\n\nChair of Delphos International, Delphos\n\nBartlett Russell\n\nDeputy Director, Defense Sciences Office, US Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA)\n\nSecurity & Risk Policy, Politics, & Regulation AI, Innovation, & Technology\n\nDespite trade disruptions, inflation, and political shifts, investor optimism in Latin America remains high. Over the past two decades, the region has seen significant development and attracted substantial foreign investment, while also making strides in reducing poverty and improving infrastructure. Latin America now stands as a more connected and prosperous region than ever before, with a large and youthful population increasingly engaged in the global economy. With promising opportunities for growth and innovation, particularly in the technology sector, Latin America is poised to become a major player in the global market.

With 10-plus years since the global financial crisis and the last 3 years marked by extreme financial stimulus, borrowers and lenders have had to acclimate to unfamiliar territory characterized by a higher cost of capital, an ever-changing regulatory environment, and technological disruptions. What are the lessons of the past decade? Where are markets headed next? What appears compelling today and has potential for tomorrow?

This panel of noted experts will assess the current military dynamic, the prospects for a diplomatic breakthrough, US and Western support for Ukraine during and following the war, and the sustainability of any territorial settlement between the two sides. The panel will assess the feasibility of a Ukrainian victory and the prospects of Russian strategic patience outlasting Western commitment.

In the wake of policy outcomes following the COVID-19 pandemic, G20 economies have grappled with servicing the largest peace-time deficits in history. The world has adapted and recovered unevenly. While the US has recovered somewhat robustly, its global peers have diverged from their pre-COVID policy responses as they seek to balance growth, inflation, solvency and employment. Where is the state of the world headed amid the current set of global challenges that require vast collective responses? Is this time different? Can we still look to the US for global economic leadership? And what does this mean for global coordination (or lack thereof)? Facing a globally divergent economic landscape for the first time in a decade, how can the US leverage its relative strength to ensure that a soft landing is not disrupted by global economic turbulence?\n\nModerator\n\nJo Ling Kent\n\nSenior Business and Technology Correspondent, CBS News\n\nSpeakers\n\nAfsaneh Beschloss\n\nFounder and CEO, Rock Creek Group\n\nJeffrey Jaensubhakij\n\nGroup Chief Investment Officer, GIC\n\nDavid M.

As countries become richer and markets freer, the story went, the more likely it was that democracy would emerge and take hold. Far from capitalism being its own gravedigger, as Marx had predicted, the creative destruction of markets guarded against the concentration of unearned power. More recently though, political upheavals in numerous countries have led some to warn that liberal democracy could be a phase more than a destination. As evidence, they point to the rise of the populist backlash by those who feel pushed aside by more favored—and more diverse—groups, and economically excluded by, in their eyes, the rent-seeking, financially privileged. For western societies to secure liberal democracy as a governing philosophy, we must examine the written and unwritten rules of how it should gain and keep the consent of those it governs. This panel brings together thinkers, writers, and policymakers at the forefront of the debate of what liberal democracy is and what we must do to preserve it.\n\nModerator\n\nMatthew Bishop\n\nChairman, Global Impact Leaders, Sorenson Institute\n\nSpeakers\n\nDaniella Ballou-Aares\n\nCEO and Co-Founder, Leadership Now Project\n\nHein De Haas\n\nDirector, International Migration Institute; Author, \"How Migration Really Works”\n\nMaría Teresa Kumar\n\nPresident and CEO, Voto Latino\n\nArmen Sarkissian\n\nFourth President of Republic of Armenia; Chairman, ATOM\n\nLucan Way\n\nDistinguished Professor of Democracy, Department of Political Science, University of Toronto\n\nPolicy, Politics, & Regulation\n\nThe 2024 UN World Water Development Report highlights a stark reality: approximately 2 billion people worldwide lack access to safe drinking water. As climate change exacerbates droughts, this figure continues to climb. Recent initiatives, like the US federal government’s $50 billion allocation to the EPA for improved water infrastructure under the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law, and USAID’s $1.2 billion investment in water security and sanitation across Asia, Latin America, and sub-Saharan Africa, offer hope. Yet, they raise crucial questions about optimal fund deployment and the role of private investment. How can we scale water conservation, build resilient watersheds, implement storm water capture and reuse initiatives, and catalyze sustainable water management and treatment solutions to maximize impact? What role should corporates play as water users and stewards? How do we ensure equitable access to clean drinking water amidst competition from different industry sectors and high costs of implementing new systems? This panel will bring together corporates, investors, government officials, water conservation experts, and sustainability leaders to chart a financially viable and environmentally sustainable path forward for water security.\n\nModerator\n\nGadi Schwartz\n\nCorrespondent, NBC News\n\nSpeakers\n\nJoey Bergstein\n\nCEO, BlueTriton Brands\n\nWade Crowfoot\n\nSecretary, California Natural Resources Agency\n\nAndré Gustavo Salcedo Teixeira Mendes\n\nCEO, Sabesp – Cia. of Basic Sanitation of the State of São Paulo\n\nMelissa Ho\n\nSenior Vice President, Freshwater and Food, World Wildlife Fund\n\nMary Jane Melendez\n\nChief Sustainability and Global Impact Officer, General Mills Inc.\n\nSustainability & Environment\n\nEurope is undergoing a period of profound political and economic transformation. While this has produced challenges to Europe's political status quo, corporate leaders and to Europe's own citizens and consumers, it has presented an opportunity to reset old certainties. Political and business leaders continue to debate how Europe can regain an economic dynamism to generate the growth needed to maintain a welfare system relied upon by a greying population, while also rethinking how to make its supply chains more resilient in the light of growing geopolitical challenges. Europe must also effectively balance advocating for its own political interests amidst potential challenges from other continents while remaining receptive to expanding global markets elsewhere in the world. Key to both renewed dynamism and global competition is the question of how Europe can nurture the next generation of leading companies in AI and tech, clean energy, and other emerging sectors: not just becoming a regulator of choice in these industries but a global market leader in its own right. This private session brings together corporate leaders and investors from both within and outside Europe to debate the big issues confronting the continent, debating the risks to Europe's prosperity and identifying opportunities at a moment of great change.\n\nOpening Remarks\n\nPetra Freddi\n\nManaging Director, Europe, Milken Institute\n\nModerator\n\nAnne McElvoy\n\nExecutive Editor and Podcast Host, Politico\n\nSpeakers\n\nJohn Aylward\n\nChief Investment Officer and Founder, Sona Asset Management\n\nAlex Baldock\n\nGroup Chief Executive, Currys\n\nKlaus Hommels\n\nFounder and Chairman, Lakestar; Chairman, NATO Innovation Fund\n\nFinancial Markets Regions & Developing Markets\n\nWith acute labor shortages, cyberattacks, increasing denials from insurance payers, and cancelled elective surgeries, healthcare institutions have faced immense challenges in the aftermath of COVID-19. As a result, hospital investment offices have been met with unique, sizable, and volatile demands in areas like budgets and objectives to subsidize hospital operations, while still aiming to produce strong returns. In the face of continued pressures, how are hospital and health-care investment offices adapting to serve the needs of their institutions? In what ways have oversight bodies and committees responded to recent challenges? How are investment offices changing structures, technologies, allocations, and pools to meet these new needs? And how can allocators effectively utilize the right mix of internal and external resources for the best possible long-term outcome?\n\nModerator\n\nJason Klein\n\nSenior Vice President and Chief Investment Officer, Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center\n\nSpeakers\n\nJenny Chan\n\nChief Investment Officer, Children's Hospital of Philadelphia\n\nRudy Hobson\n\nSenior Managing Director, The Colorado Health Foundation\n\nDarrel Pfeifauf\n\nVice President, Asset Allocation and Risk, Advocate Health\n\nAlyssa Rieder\n\nChief Investment Officer, CommonSpirit Health\n\nFinancial Markets Business & Industry Health & Medical Research\n\nThe entertainment industry is evolving to meet the demands of consumers.

Having weathered unprecedented changes following a high in pandemic-era spending which drove up real estate valuations followed by inflation and interest rates hikes, there has undoubtedly been differential dislocations across sectors in the real estate market. The combination of rapid rise in interest rates coupled with regional U.S. bank exposure to commercial real estate led to several bank failures. With banks tightening on lending across the board, how does this present opportunities across the real estate capital stack? On the flipside for residential real estate, as high rates and massive housing shortage place pressure on new buyers, what are the long-term implications for an economy in transition from home buyers to long-term renters? How are astute real estate investors navigating the dispersion across sectors when the cement settles in real estate?\n\nModerator\n\nTed Seides\n\nFounder, Capital Allocators\n\nSpeakers\n\nJase Auby\n\nChief Investment Officer, Teacher Retirement System of Texas\n\nMaggie Coleman\n\nChief Investment Officer, Real Estate Equity, Global Co-Head Portfolio Management, Manulife Investment Management\n\nJoshua Morris\n\nPartner, Global Real Estate, Davidson Kempner Capital Management\n\nTim Sloan\n\nVice Chairman, Fortress Investment Group\n\nJoshua Weintraub\n\nCEO, Residential Opportunities, Senior Managing Director, Cerberus Capital Management\n\nFinancial Markets\n\nHistorically, global investment flows to the Asia Pacific were aimed at leveraging the growth potential of diverse emerging and advanced economies. Over the last decade, global asset managers and institutional investors have been able to generate strong and stable returns from various asset classes by taking advantage of low capital costs, booming consumer markets, technological innovations, and improved regulatory and governance environments. While few would doubt the region’s ability to generate returns, the subdued global economy and a strong US dollar have impacted the availability of capital for companies to grow. Our experts will analyze the investment outlook throughout the Asia Pacific, from Australia to ASEAN, and North and East Asia. Which asset classes are still pulling in fresh capital?

Research further indicates marked shortfalls in savings along with lack of any retirement savings on the part of at least 25 percent of workers. Levels of financial education and fluency are tied to financial security. How do we enhance engagement with finance and investing so that all Americans have the financial stability and security to live the American dream? Innovative programs that encourage earners at every level to turn towards finance, serve to educate potential investors, and stand with those who need assistance in developing a financial plan are on the rise.

At long last, the US seems to have reached an inflection point, with the White House Initiative on Women’s Health Research to bolster transformative investment in research areas ranging from heart attacks in women to menopause management. Could revitalized research and investment begin to address historic disparities and inequities in women’s health? Can we translate scientific and research breakthroughs into clinical practice? Which conditions need urgent attention and where does care begin?

With the Saudi Stock Exchange (Tadawul) now ranking as the 10th largest exchange globally, coupled with reforms led by the Saudi Capital Market Authority, the kingdom's capital markets are poised for expansion and international recognition. Foreign investors' increased participation—ownership grew from approximately $50 billion in 2019 to over $100 billion in June 2023—reflects growing confidence. The need for alternative financing solutions to businesses across various sectors is a key driver in the expansion of public and private debt and equity markets, supporting economic diversification and fostering entrepreneurship. With the emergence of REITs as a viable investment vehicle, Saudi Arabia's real estate sector has also attracted considerable attention from both domestic and international investors. Join our panelists to analyze Saudi's progress towards increasing capital liquidity, market transparency, and regulatory certainty.

For a framework originally developed to serve a university endowment with perpetual time horizon, its principles have been adapted and implemented across different investors and their mandates. In a world where institutional investors and asset managers are continually hunting for yield amid a difficult and volatile environment, what is the true value of diversification?

For every leveraged buyout financed by broadly syndicated bank loans, there are four financed by private credit. While the cost of capital remains high for both borrowers and lenders, and young investment teams acclimate to unfamiliar territory, creative deal structures have reemerged to bolster access to capital. While refinancing debt, direct lenders and private equity sponsors have increased equity capital injections, and as dry powder to support existing portfolio companies has disappeared, deal teams have increasingly used payment-in-kind financing structures. The opportunity set is widening for investors and lenders. So, where do our seasoned panelists see the market headed? How can retail investors gain access to the exciting world of private credit? Importantly, what can we do to keep capital accessible and ensure continued growth?\n\nModerator\n\nLiz Hoffman\n\nBusiness and Finance Editor, Semafor\n\nSpeakers\n\nDianna Carr-Coletta\n\nManaging Director, Direct Lending, PGIM Private Capital\n\nDavid Geenberg\n\nCo-Head, North American Investment Team, Strategic Value Partners\n\nTheodore L.

The dangerous consequences of climate change are now a daily reality across the globe threatening millions of lives and trillions of dollars of built assets by 2050. At the same time, current strategies to deploy public and private capital such as Investor 100+ and carbon pricing are experiencing mixed success, amid conflicting trends as both global oil demand and clean energy deployment rates rise together. Navigating this zone of paradox will demand adaptive strategies over the next critical decade of deployment. That’s why we must re-think the road to Net Zero by front-loading more climate adaptation and resilience investment and building next generation mechanisms to reach the Paris Agreement’s goals.\n\nModerator\n\nDan Carol\n\nSenior Director, MI Finance, Milken Institute\n\nSpeakers\n\nMark Gallogly\n\nCo-founder and Managing Partner, Three Cairns Group\n\nAmber D.

With growing geopolitical uncertainty, inflation, and continued interest hikes, volatility seems to be here to stay. How are investors adapting to more modest market returns? What is the impact of the explosion in investment data, and the global incorporation of sustainability? What role does technology play in shaping the future of active fund management, and how are firms integrating data analytics and AI to enhance decision-making and drive alpha generation? How is geopolitical uncertainty and geographical allocation shifting market dynamics? This roundtable of leading asset owners will be an opportunity for frank, unfiltered discussion about the future of the industry.\n\nOpening Remarks\n\nAmanda Schlumpf\n\nAssociate Director, Business and Program Development, Milken Institute\n\nModerator\n\nSpeakers\n\nCameron Black\n\nChief Investment Officer, Blue Cross Blue Shield of Arizona\n\nElizabeth Fernando\n\nChief Investment Officer, NEST\n\nPatrick Fleming\n\nChief Investment Officer, State of Wyoming\n\nPedro Furtado Reis\n\nCo-Chief Investment Officer, Equities, Norges Bank Investment Management\n\nFinancial Markets\n\nThe early days of motherhood are often painted with rosy hues, but in reality, they involve significant identity transformation and emotional challenges that persist far into the first year. Postpartum depression affects nearly one in five new mothers, often leading many to endure physical and emotional burdens for up to a year after childbirth. Consequently, roughly 43 percent of highly skilled women leave their careers either temporarily or permanently after giving birth, hampering economic productivity and labor markets. In response, brands are innovating and investing in postpartum care products and services to fill the void left by the inadequate resources within the US health care system. The pregnancy and motherhood market is valued at $35-40 billion in the US alone. This private session delves beyond the \"baby blues,\" uncovering postpartum realities from physical recovery to mental health struggles and workforce impact. We'll hear from mothers, health-care professionals, advocates, and investors, who will address resource shortcomings, investment prospects, and strategies for enhancing maternal support during this pivotal period. Let's create a future where mothers are truly seen, heard, empowered, and invested in the way they should be.\n\nIntroductory Remarks\n\nAlex Schueler\n\nSenior Director, Business and Program Development, Milken Institute\n\nModerator\n\nMallika Chopra\n\nCEO, Chopra Global\n\nSpeakers\n\nLori Bregman\n\nDoula, Author, Wellness and Women's Empowerment Coach\n\nEmilie Fritz Veloso\n\nFounder and CEO, One Tribe\n\nHarvey Karp\n\nFounder and CEO, Happiest Baby\n\nKate Ryder\n\nCEO and Founder, Maven Clinic\n\nLatham Thomas\n\nFounder, Mama Glow; Visiting Professor of Gender and Sexuality Studies, Brown University\n\nOlivia Walton\n\nFounder and CEO, Ingeborg Investments\n\nSecurity & Risk Health & Medical Research\n\nWhen you’re starting or scaling a business, you need to invest wisely.

Transform struggles into strengths and work with the natural rhythms of every individual on your team.\n\nJust over 15 years since the outbreak of the Global Financial Crisis in September 2008, so much yet so little has changed across the capital markets. Markets today are showing signs of stability with the rate-hike cycle expected to be over soon. As many hold their breath in anticipation of rate cuts and consequential cascading relief to the money markets, financial market players still face insurmountable challenges in juggling the fallout of market stresses. Geopolitical competition, volatility, liquidity concerns, net zero transition and various risk factors have different impacts on asset classes. What are investors looking at—broad range economic indicators and market-specific considerations alike—as a basis for asset allocation and disruption? What lessons have we learnt from previous crises that still hold true? In defining a new age of investing ahead, what are the imperatives and cornerstones?\n\nModerator\n\nCarol Massar\n\nTV and Radio Anchor, Bloomberg Media\n\nSpeakers\n\nSean Dobson\n\nCEO and Chief Investment Officer, Amherst\n\nLaurence Gottlieb\n\nCEO, Fundamental Advisors\n\nShyam Rajan\n\nGlobal Head of Fixed Income, Citadel Securities\n\nDana Settle\n\nCo-Founder, Managing Partner, Greycroft\n\nScott Spielvogel\n\nManaging Partner, One Rock Capital Partners\n\nFinancial Markets\n\nUpside scenarios forecast private markets to reach 10 percent of global AUM by 2025, and it remains one of the biggest opportunities in asset management. Yet, despite this $14 trillion target, 2023 recorded lackluster returns for private equity as private credit exposure continued to grow. Investors have had to diversify allocations across multi-asset class alternatives to drive returns and differentiate themselves from their peers. What are the mega-forces reshaping private market asset classes today? Will the headwinds of continued elevated interest rates, changing institutional capital requirements, and buoyant public markets impede subsectors in the industry, or will they present new opportunities? As memories of the ‘08 financial crisis and the 2020 pandemic linger, how can the history of decision-making help bring to the fore present-day opportunities?\n\nModerator\n\nYup S.

By most estimates, 2023 was just a preview of worse to come. There is an urgent need to recognize the new climate reality and the impact it’s having on public and private resources, and move the conversation in climate finance to a more pragmatic and impactful approach. Is the current climate financing dialogue consistent with this new reality? If not, what is needed to bring sharper focus on building resilience and adaptive infrastructure? What regional or global mechanisms exist—or need to be created—to direct capital to high-impact initiatives? Panelists will discuss the new climate reality, its financing environment, and the need to give prominence to portfolios that build better adaptive and more resilient infrastructure.\n\nModerator\n\nAimée Christensen\n\nCEO, Christensen Global\n\nSpeakers\n\nGillian Caldwell\n\nChief Climate Officer and Deputy Assistant Administrator, United States Agency for International Development (USAID)\n\nJeff Goodell\n\nNew York Times Bestselling Author, \"The Heat Will Kill You First\" and “The Water Will Come\"; Contributing Writer, Rolling Stone\n\nEkhosuehi Iyahen\n\nSecretary General, Insurance Development Forum\n\nStacey Swann\n\nFounder and CEO, Resilient Earth Capital\n\nSecurity & Risk Sustainability & Environment Regions & Developing Markets\n\nWe are at a time now where the financial position of women is stronger than ever with women controlling most of the consumer spending and standing to inherit a significant portion of the generational wealth transfer. There is a $700 billion opportunity if banks and other institutions do no more than provide financial services for women at the same rate as for men. However, the barriers that have historically impeded women persist, with less than 3 percent of venture capital flowing to female-led startups, the gender pay gap, and unequal responsibilities at home. How will we respond to this catalytic moment? Where are allocators finding the most success? How can investors accelerate the growth of women-owned businesses?\n\nModerator\n\nAnna Mason\n\nManaging Partner, Ingeborg Investments\n\nSpeakers\n\nTonya Allen\n\nPresident, The McKnight Foundation\n\nErin Harkless Moore\n\nManaging Director, Investments, Pivotal Ventures\n\nKwanza Jones\n\nCEO and Founder, Kwanza Jones and José E.

While the food and agriculture industry makes up $7.63 trillion worldwide, it also accounts for 15 percent of fossil fuel use and one-third of greenhouse gas emissions, which makes the industry an essential component of the global economy and any climate solutions. Yet today’s food systems are largely funded by philanthropic grants, government subsidies, limited lending with high-risk loan funds, and investor tax credits. Defining food systems as an asset class would drive sustained and reliable funding for the transformation of food systems, which would promote economic and community development, mitigate the impacts of climate change, and improve population health. In this session, food systems and financing experts will discuss the investment case for food systems and how such investment can be a catalyst for inclusive, sustainable, and resilient transformation.\n\nModerator\n\nDanielle Nierenberg\n\nPresident, Food Tank\n\nSpeakers\n\nErtharin Cousin\n\nCEO and Managing Director, Food Systems for the Future\n\nAnna Lappe\n\nExecutive Director, Global Alliance for the Future of Food\n\nAdam Waglay\n\nCo-Founder and Co-CEO, Butterfly Equity\n\nCraig Wichner\n\nFounder and Managing Partner, Farmland LP\n\nFinancial Markets Sustainability & Environment Health & Medical Research\n\nWhile the European-US alliance proved durable for much of the 20th century, today that bond is under strain as it faces geopolitical challenges as profound as any of the last century. This session delves into the questions shaping the future of Europe and its relation to the US. Will Europe be a bridge connecting competing civilizations and spheres of influence? Or, faced with the unbridgeable divide between Western hegemony and its autocratic challengers, will it choose the side of liberal democracy? Can Europe put collective interest ahead of narrower national concerns, or will a lack of cohesion result in it being sidelined? This conversation will explore the choices Europe faces, including ways to build and maintain the agency needed to exercise strategic autonomy. Key issues addressed will include the challenges posed by an aging population, potential new sources of economic dynamism and growth, and the commitments of collective defenses. Join us for an insightful conversation with prominent thought leaders, policymakers, and regional experts as we explore the potential trajectories that will shape the future of Europe and the broader Western alliance.\n\nModerator\n\nSuzanne Lynch\n\nGlobal Playbook Author and Associate Editor, Politico\n\nSpeakers\n\nBenedetta Berti\n\nHead of Policy Planning, Office of the Secretary General, North Atlantic Treaty Organization\n\nBenedikt Franke\n\nVice-Chairman and CEO, Munich Security Conference\n\nMichael Spence\n\nProfessor and Dean Emeritus, Stanford Business School\n\nKinga Stanislawska\n\nFounder, European Women in VC\n\nSecurity & Risk Regions & Developing Markets Policy, Politics, & Regulation\n\nThe majority of Americans are not saving enough to meet their needs in retirement. Generating income in retirement has often been referred to as a three-legged stool composed of pensions, Social Security, and defined contribution/401(k) plans. Relying on Social Security as a sole source of retirement income will leave many workers at or near the poverty level, and many pensions are gone or frozen. Join other retirement and workplace benefits leaders to discuss the development of a national framework to even out the other leg of the stool—providing more income certainty within a defined contribution plan. Contribute to the discussion of where we are now, what needs to change, and how finance leaders could create a better system. This important discussion will focus on the practical implementation of bold changes that can reshape our shared futures by enhancing financial security for all Americans.\n\nModerator\n\nEric Stevenson\n\nPresident, Retirement Solutions, Nationwide\n\nSpeakers\n\nCheryl Evans\n\nDirector, MI Finance, Milken Institute\n\nJosh Jessup\n\nGeneral Manager Global Retirement and Financial Wellness, Delta Air Lines\n\nWade Pfau\n\nProfessor, The American College of Financial Services\n\nFinancial Markets Policy, Politics, & Regulation Capital Access & Economic Opportunity\n\nAs volatility in equity and credit markets begins to ease, investors find themselves navigating a landscape where the fundamentals of capital markets are undergoing significant shifts that haven’t been witnessed in more than a decade. The era of abundant liquidity is waning, marked by a rising cost of capital, and equity markets contending with a sustained and heightened risk-free rate. Equity issuance may face smaller initial offers, whereas volatility may return to debt markets as issuers grapple with persistently high rates alongside priced-in rate cuts. All that, while contending with technological shifts across the industry, adding another layer of complexity. Amid the murky waters ahead, what are meaningful changes in the public markets and alpha generation? As we draw close toward the Fed’s interest-rate pivot, are investors pausing to take stock across the market? What remains of investable themes at home and abroad for the rest of 2024?\n\nModerator\n\nRomaine Bostick\n\nTV Anchor, Bloomberg\n\nSpeakers\n\nTodd Barker\n\nCEO and Chief Investment Officer, Freestone Grove Partners\n\nKelly Granat\n\nCo-Chief Investment Officer, Lone Pine Capital\n\nGeorge Maris\n\nChief Investment Officer and Global Head of Equities, Principal Asset Management\n\nPedro Furtado Reis\n\nCo-Chief Investment Officer, Equities, Norges Bank Investment Management\n\nFinancial Markets\n\nTo tackle cancer, we first need to identify it. Many cancers, if found early, have a survival rate of at least 90 percent. However, 65 percent of Americans are not up to date on at least one of their routine cancer screenings. Revolutionary cancer screening technologies entering the market are designed to take account of patient preferences and potentially expand access to, and decrease the inconvenience and discomfort of, conventional cancer screening tests. Innovative technologies—such as smart patches that can detect melanoma without an incision, a quick blood test to detect colorectal cancer, and an at-home self-collection test for cervical cancer—have the power to change how physicians diagnose cancer and increase the number of people getting screened. This panel of experts will examine the proliferation of innovative and at-home cancer-screening technologies, along with their anticipated impact on early cancer detection, increased access for patients, and effective cancer care.\n\nModerator\n\nSpeakers\n\nKara Egan\n\nCEO, Teal Health\n\nHelmy Eltoukhy\n\nCo-Founder, Chairman and Co-CEO, Guardant Health\n\nJody Hoyos\n\nCEO, Prevent Cancer Foundation\n\nLarry Kessler\n\nProfessor, Health Systems and Population Health, Adjunct Professor, Pharmacy, University of Washington\n\nAnaeze Offodile\n\nExecutive Vice President and Chief Strategy Officer, Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center\n\nHealth & Medical Research\n\nOver the next several years, the United States will take part in at least four major events that could help shape the future of the nation and the world: the 250th Anniversary of the United States, the World Cup, the Olympic and Paralympic Games, and the opening of the Center for Advancing the American Dream. Each of these moments offers a unique opportunity to generate excitement on their own, but together, they represent a historic confluence of events that can reinvigorate the American spirit, engage communities across the country, revitalize interest in our shared history among younger generations, and bring to life the long-held belief that out of many, we are one. Sports represent the purest form of meritocracy, where natural talent and hard work converge to produce excellence, which is perhaps why sports have long transcended our domestic and international divides. And the celebration of our founding—and our founding ideals—offers us an important time of reflection in the face of an uncertain future. Together, these events provide the United States with a unique diplomatic opportunity to demonstrate to each of us and to the rest of the world what our nation stands for as it ushers in the next 250 years of American democracy.\n\nModerator\n\nJim Gray\n\nSportscaster, Fox, SiriusXM and Amazon Prime; Author, \"Talking to GOATs\"\n\nSpeakers\n\nJanet Evans\n\nJanet Evans, Chief Athletic Officer, LA28\n\nGianni Infantino\n\nPresident, Fédération Internationale de Football Association (FIFA)\n\nRosie Rios\n\nChair, America250 Commission\n\nLindsey Vonn\n\nOlympic Champion and Entrepreneur\n\nSociety & Culture\n\nThroughout history, the American presidency has stood as an emblem of democracy and strength and has survived challenges to the core values of democratic governance. As we live through turbulent political times, and as the world grapples with unremitting geopolitical change, it is more critical than ever to advance democratic ideals at home and abroad. Join us to hear from leaders of US presidential centers as they continue the legacy of US presidents and how they are working today to advance the principles of democracy and public diplomacy.\n\nModerator\n\nEugene Daniels\n\nPlaybook Author and White House Correspondent, Politico\n\nSpeakers\n\nPaige Alexander\n\nCEO, The Carter Center\n\nKen Hersh\n\nPresident and CEO, George W.

In industries such as electric vehicles, e-commerce, AI, telecommunications, and creative design, business creators are building solutions to meet local challenges then transferring their successful models beyond their borders. How were these entrepreneurs able to find success in domestic and international markets? What lessons can be learned from building companies that can be transferred to any region? What opportunities exist for investors to partner with this next generation of innovators?\n\nModerator\n\nDiane Brady\n\nExecutive Director, Fortune Live Media; Editorial Director, Fortune CEO Initiative\n\nSpeakers\n\nBinny Bansal\n\nCo-Founder, xto10x Tech"
