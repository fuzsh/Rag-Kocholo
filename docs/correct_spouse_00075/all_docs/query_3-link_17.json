        "text": "In high school Poppy Montgomery was a straight-A student. She excelled in Angst, Anarchy, and held an Abject Adversity to Authority.\n\nWhile the now 36-year-old actor is on a career high playing a woman with a seemingly limitless memory in this season's breakout US drama Unforgettable, her formative years kicking around Sydney were memorable for all the wrong reasons.\n\n\"I was expelled from six private schools in Australia,\" she tells us on set in New York, leaning dangerously forward in her chair, a broad grin on her face as she combs a hand through the rich ruddiness of her long hair.\n\nBest known for playing FBI special agent Samantha Spade on Without A Trace, Montgomery is now front and centre on Unforgettable.\n\nHer character, Carrie Wells, has a condition known as hyperthymesia, also known as HSAM (Highly Superior Autobiographical Memory). The real-life condition, affecting only a handful of people in the US, means the person has an extraordinary capacity to recall specific events, down to the tiniest detail, from his or her past.\n\nGive them a date, even in many years past, and they can recall with chilling accuracy what happened to them and around them on that day.\n\nThe only thing former police detective Carrie has trouble recalling are details about the murder of her sister Rachel, many years earlier.\n\nIn describing some of Carrie's actions when reunited with a former lover and partner (Nip/Tuck's Dylan Walsh) to solve crimes, as being off-centre and somewhat rebellious, Montgomery sees a parallel with her nature.\n\n\"Carrie's a rebel. She is someone who lives by her rules and I can identify with that,\" she says, recalling her emotion-charged meetings with principals and subsequent expulsions.\n\n\"I certainly have that streak in me - not so now - but I certainly can go back to that and identify with it in Carrie.\n\n\"I went to Ascham (School). I went to SCEGGS (Darlinghurst). I went to Kambala (Girls School). I went to every Sydney girls school to the point where at like 15 I just dropped out. Well I've done all of them.\n\n\"I was just outspoken. I didn't want to wear the school uniform in the way they wanted me to wear it - mine was always too short or my hair was dyed or I was wearing make-up. The school didn't allow for a lot of personality and I definitely worked mine in there - and apparently that didn't go down too well.\"\n\nWhile Carrie's back story has her throwing herself into police work at an early age, Montgomery's escape was acting. At 18 she packed up and headed for Los Angeles, soon scoring cameo spots in shows such as NYPD Blue and Party Of Five. The work continued to flow in before she settled into the Without A Trace gig alongside fellow Aussie Anthony LaPaglia. That lasted for seven seasons. Its end tied in with Montgomery and her boy-friend, Adam Kaufman, welcoming their son, Jackson Phillip Kaufman into the world. LaPaglia is the little boy's godfather.\n\n\"I either play really famous women like J.K. Rowling (telemovie Magic Beyond Words) or Marilyn Monroe (Blonde) or I play a-little-on-the-edge cop characters,\" Montgomery says. \"I think I am drawn to strong female characters overall. Basically I took two years off to be with my son, who is three-and-a-half now and I've been working since I was so young - so that was weird for me not to be working. Any working mum will tell you it's not easy to juggle everything.\n\n\"You always feel like you're not giving one part of your life as much as you should. But we all do it. It's a great privilege to be able to work and have a child so I try to juggle it the best I can.\"\n\nShe has relocated to New York for filming, with Kaufman and Jackson staying in Los Angeles because of her son's schooling. They criss-cross the country to stay in contact.\n\n\"We are going to keep our house in LA,\" Montgomery explains. \"He (Jackson) came to New York with me and loved it, went berserk. It is his kind of city. I was worried because he is such a California kid. The travel is good for him and he is at that age where he is still portable. Your life adapts around it.\"\n\nMontgomery went through a pretty rigorous program with a personal trainer to get in shape for the series. \"I wanted her to take on a superhero look,\" she says. \"I felt like she had this superhero ability.\"\n\nWhile the series is enjoying freshman success in the US and looks likely to be picked up for a full season, Montgomery still is keen to schedule time to get back to Australia for a break.\n\n\"I was back for Christmas last year and I try to bring my son home as much as possible because my parents live there,\" she says. \"I try to get back once a year to spend time with my family.\"\n\nSwitched On suggests that with her success that when she's in Sydney she may want to revisit some of her old school haunts and hang out front, thumbing her nose?\n\n\"Exactly,\" she says with a rich cackle. \"Here I am. Look at me now!\"\n\nUnforgettable, Nine, Thursday, October 6, 8.30pm"
