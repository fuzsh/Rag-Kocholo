        "text": "Fast Facts\n\nLived in the same town and attended the same high school as State of Affairs star Katherine Heigl\n\nAs he's a few years older, however, they never walked the hallways at the same time\n\nAspired to become a pro baseball player until his senior year of high school, when he grew tired of the sport\n\nOffered baseball scholarships to three universities, but chose a different life's path instead\n\nDiscovered acting through a scheduling fluke\n\nHe took Theatre 101 as a college freshman because it was the only elective that fit in with the rest of his planned classes\n\nTo his surprise, it spoke to him in a way that he hadn't expected\n\nPost-college, studied acting at the Circle in the Square Theatre School and Eugene O'Neill Theater Center's National Theater Institute"
