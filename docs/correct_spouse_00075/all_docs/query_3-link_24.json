Expelled from the religion and an outcast, Ann Eliza crusades against polygamy in the United States. In the present day, a murder involving a polygamist family unfolds as Jordan Scott, a young man cast out of his fundamentalist sect years ago, must reenter the world that cast him aside in order to determine the truth behind his father’s death. And as Ann Eliza’s narrative intertwines with Jordan’s search, readers are pulled deeper into the mysteries of love and faith.\n\n(DE) HISTORICAL MYSTERY; PARALLEL NARRATIVES\n\n22 Britannia Road by Amanda Hodgkinson\n\nAt the end of World War II, Silvana and her near-feral eight-year-old son Aurek board the ship that will take them from Poland to England. After living wild in the forests for years, carrying a terrible secret, all Silvana knows is that she and Aurek are survivors. Everything else is lost. Waiting for them in England is her husband Janusz, who has not seen his wife or son in six years. He has reinvented himself as an Englishman in hopes of forgetting the past. But the six years spent apart have changed them all. To make a real home, Silvana and Janusz will have to come to terms with what happened during the war, accept that each is different, and allow their beloved but wild son to be who he truly is.\n\n(MA) HISTORICAL FICTION; ENGAGING\n\nAbsolution by Alice McDermott\n\nTricia is a shy newlywed, married to a rising attorney on loan to navy intelligence. Charlene is a practiced corporate spouse and mother of three, a beauty and a bully. In Saigon in 1963, the two women form a wary alliance as they balance the era’s mandate to be “helpmeets” to their ambitious husbands with their own inchoate impulse to “do good” for the people of Vietnam. Sixty years later, Charlene’s daughter, spurred by an encounter with an aging Vietnam vet, reaches out to Tricia. Together, they look back at their time in Saigon, taking wry account of that pivotal year and of Charlene’s altruistic machinations, and discovering how their own lives as women on the periphery—of politics, of history, of war, of their husbands’ convictions—have been shaped and burdened by the same sort of unintended consequences that followed America’s tragic interference in Southeast Asia.\n\n(HA) FICTION; RIVETING; VIETNAM WAR\n\nThe Accidental by Ali Smith\n\nAmber, thirty-something and barefoot, shows up at the door of the Norfolk cottage that the Smarts have rented for the summer. She talks her way in. She tells nothing but lies. She stays for dinner. As she insinuates herself into the family, the questions of who she is and how she’s come to be there drop away. Instead, dazzled by her seeming exoticism, the Smarts begin to examine the accidents of their lives through the searing lens of Amber’s perceptions. When Eve Smart finally banishes her from the cottage, Amber disappears from their sight, but not—they discover when they return home—from their profoundly altered lives.\n\n(MA) LITERARY FICTION; EXPERIMENTAL; FAMILY LIFE\n\nThe Adventures of Tom Sawyer by Mark Twain\n\nOn the banks of the Mississippi River, Tom Sawyer and his friends seek out adventure at every turn. Then one fateful night in the graveyard, they witness a murder. The boys make an oath to never reveal the secret, and they run away to be pirates in search of treasure. But when Tom gets trapped in a cave with scary Injun Joe, can he escape unharmed?\n\n(UP) CLASSIC FICTION; HUMOROUS; CHARMING\n\nThe Alice Network by Kate Quinn\n\nIn the aftermath of World War II, unwed American college girl Charlie St. Clair is pregnant. She’s also nursing a desperate hope that her beloved cousin Rose, who disappeared in France during the war, might still be alive. When Charlie’s parents banish her to Europe to have her “little problem” taken care of, she flees to London, determined to find out what happened to Rose. There, she finds Eve Gardiner, a woman who worked as a spy for the Alice Network during World War I.
