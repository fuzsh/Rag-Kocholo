        "text": "Actor Adam Kaufman may be best known for his 2002 role in Steven Spielberg science fiction mini-series Taken. I unfortunately never saw that series, but had been taken with Mr. Kaufman back in 1999 when he made his first television appearance on Buffy The Vampire Slayer.\n\nI have been wanting to profile Adam Kaufman since starting the blog, but there were surprisingly very few good images whenever I started to pull together a post. Recently however, with the announcement that Adam is joining Katherine Heigl and Alfre Woodard on NBC's State Of Affairs this fall, I decided to pull what I had and finally give the actor his due.\n\nI am positive I was not the only Buffy viewer who instantly crushed over Adam when he joined Buffy in 1999 as Parker Abrams. His puppy dog eyes, his great face and adorable nose and that beautifully perfect head of hair. Buffy fell hard too,falling into bed with Parker in the season 4 episode Harsh Light Of Day. The episodes title sadly foreshadowed where Parker's character was heading. After a night of sex, Parker turned out to be a bit of a douche and sadly didn't stick around long. Buffy soon moved on to another hot coed hunk, this time in the form of Riley Finn (Marc Blucas).\n\nBuffy The Vampire Slayer\n\nDawson's Creek\n\nIf the WB's Buffy began my crush, the WB's Dawson's Creek cemented it. Kaufman went straight from Buffy to playing Jack's first boyfriend, Ethan on Dawson's Creek. His first appearance was in December 1999 in the episode, Close Encounters of the Close Kind. Although this relationship was again a short one, Ethan did serve as a mentor and bridge for Jack and featured Jack's first, and I believe the shows first, televised same sex kiss.\n\nAfter Creek, Kaufman had stints on Without A Trace (with then partner Poppy Montgomery) and a host of other guest spots on television series and tv movies. State Of Affairs however, marks his first return as a regular on series television since 2007. Welcome back Adam!\n\nCupid\n\nThe Client List"
