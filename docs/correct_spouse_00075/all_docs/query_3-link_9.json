        "text": "Poppy Montgomery, who appears on the hit show \"Unforgettable,\" is sure to always remember this special period in her life – particularly because she just welcomed her second child, a daughter!\n\nNamed Violet Grace Devereux Sanford, Montgomery's bundle of joy tipped the scales at 6 pounds and 12 ounces, and the little one measured all the way out to 19.5 inches long, making her quite a delivery indeed.\n\n\"We are overjoyed with the arrival of our beautiful angel and filled with gratitude that she is happy, healthy and thriving,\" the couple told People magazine.\n\nThis is the first child for Montgomery, 37, and her boyfriend, Shawn Sanford, a Microsoft executive. The pair began dating in late 2011. Montgomery also has a 5-year-old son, Jackson, from a previous relationship with actor Adam Kaufman.\n\nWhy Violet, of all names? According to Montgomery, it's a long-standing tradition in her family to name little girls after flowers. The actress – who herself is named after a flower – has four sisters, named Rosie Thorn, Daisy Yellow, Lily Belle and Marigold Sun."
