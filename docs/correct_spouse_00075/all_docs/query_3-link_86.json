        "text": "Anthony LaPaglia (, Italian pronunciation: [laˈpaʎʎa]; born 31 January 1959) is an Australian actor. He has won three AACTA Awards, Best Actor in a Leading Role for Lantana (2001) and Balibo (2009), and Best Actor in a Supporting Role for Nitram (2021).\n\nFor his starring role as Jack Malone on the American television crime drama series Without a Trace (2002–09), he received a Golden Globe Award in 2004. LaPaglia won a Tony Award for Best Actor in a Play for his portrayal of Eddie Carbone in the 1997 Broadway revival of A View from the Bridge, and a Primetime Emmy Award for his role as Simon Moon on the television sitcom Frasier (2000–04).\n\nHe has also appeared in films such as Betsy's Wedding (1990), So I Married an Axe Murderer (1993), Empire Records (1995), Autumn in New York (2000), Happy Feet (2006) and its sequel Happy Feet Two (2011), Mental (2012), Holding the Man (2015), and Annabelle: Creation (2017).\n\nEarly life and education\n\nLaPaglia was born in Adelaide, South Australia, the son of Maria Johannes (née Brendel), a secretary and model, and Egidio \"Eddie\" LaPaglia (deceased), an auto mechanic and car dealer. LaPaglia's mother was Dutch, and his father emigrated from Bovalino, Calabria, Italy, at the age of eighteen. His younger brother, Jonathan LaPaglia, is also an actor, and his other brother, Michael, is a car wholesaler in Los Angeles. LaPaglia attended Rostrevor College and Norwood High School.\n\nLaPaglia was working in Adelaide as a shoe salesman for Florsheim Shoes in the early 1980s. He asked to be transferred to the US and continued working there while studying acting as he was rejected by the prestigious Sydney drama school NIDA. LaPaglia first began his venture into dramatic art in his late teens, when he enrolled in an acting course at the South Australian Castings Agency (SA Castings) in Adelaide. The two-and-half-year course was to be supplemented with a further three months, which would have included a \"boot camp\" and a trial listing with SA Castings. After completing one-and-a-half years of the course, LaPaglia left Adelaide for Los Angeles.\n\nCareer\n\n1985–1999\n\nLaPaglia's earliest credit was a 1985 part in an episode of the television series Steven Spielberg's Amazing Stories. His first feature film was Cold Steel in 1987, followed that same year by the title role of Frank Nitti in the telemovie Nitti: The Enforcer. LaPaglia had a supporting role as a mobster in the minor hit Betsy's Wedding (1990).\n\nHe starred alongside Danny Aiello and Lainie Kazan in 29th Street, a fact-based comedy/bio-pic, as the first New York State Lottery winner, Frank Pesce Jr. This was followed by roles in the vampire/Mafia story Innocent Blood (1992), the comedy thriller So I Married an Axe Murderer (1993), the legal thriller The Client (1994), and the comedy Empire Records in 1995. That same year, LaPaglia appeared in the role of Jimmy Wyler, lead character in the TV series Murder One, during its second and final season. LaPaglia made his debut in an Australian production opposite Hugo Weaving in The Custodian (1993). The following year he appeared in the romantic comedy Paperback Romance (1994) with Gia Carides, whom he later married.\n\nDuring 1997–98, LaPaglia appeared in a Broadway production of Arthur Miller's A View from the Bridge with the Roundabout Theatre Company and later received a Tony Award for his portrayal of the protagonist, Eddie Carbone. LaPaglia also played Tito Merelli in Ken Ludwig's Lend Me a Tenor on Broadway. Before A View From the Bridge opened, LaPaglia was sent a script for the pilot of The Sopranos and met its creator, David Chase, to discuss the role of protagonist Tony Soprano. However, various factors, including Fox and his Broadway role, prevented LaPaglia from obtaining the role.\n\nSpike Lee cast LaPaglia as a New York police detective in Summer of Sam (1999). During 2000–04, LaPaglia appeared in eight episodes of the sitcom Frasier, including the finale, playing Daphne Moon's brother Simon. The role won him an Emmy Award for \"Outstanding Guest Actor in a Comedy Series\".\n\n2000–2011\n\nHe continued to live mainly in Los Angeles, returning occasionally—especially from about 2000—for roles in major Australian films such as Looking for Alibrandi (2000), Lantana (2001), The Bank (2001), Happy Feet (2006), $9.99 (2008), Balibo (2009), and Happy Feet Two (2011). In 2002, LaPaglia co-starred as a fire captain opposite Sigourney Weaver in The Guys, a film about New York firemen who died in the World Trade Center. He also played the role onstage, rotating with Bill Murray and others. \"We did it as a tribute to the men,\" said LaPaglia. \"I've been so lucky to do it, to be part of this experience. But I can't go back to that morning or watch the video. It's too painful.\" He also played fictional Australian actor Anthony Bella (who played Nicky Caesar in the fictitious series Little Caesar) in the comedy movie Analyze That, but was uncredited in his role.\n\nIn addition to playing the central character in Without a Trace during 2002–09, LaPaglia co-wrote an episode entitled \"Deep Water\". In 2009, LaPaglia played the part of Roger East, a real-life Australian journalist, in the political thriller Balibo, about the killing in 1975 of five Australian journalists by the Indonesian Army in the town of Balibo, East Timor. The opening scene depicts East's own summary execution, during the Indonesian invasion.\n\nIn October 2011 it was announced that LaPaglia would join the cast of Quentin Tarantino's new film Django Unchained, in which he would portray an Australian character once again. However, he eventually left the project, calling the production \"out of control.\"\n\n2012–present\n\nOn 18 February 2012, it was announced that LaPaglia would star in the ABC drama pilot Americana. The show was not picked up. It was announced in May 2013 that LaPaglia signed on in the feature adaptation of Stephen King's A Good Marriage with Joan Allen. In March 2014, LaPaglia joined a new CBS terrorism drama pilot titled Red Zone starring as a retired CIA operative and current high school football coach who returns to active duty after a terrorist attack in Washington, D.C. It was renamed Field of Play and not picked up for the 2014 season.\n\nFrom about 2012, LaPaglia began accepting work in Australia more frequently. Following major roles in Underground (2012) (a biopic about Julian Assange) and the comedy Mental (2012), LaPaglia had a supporting role in the Neil Armfield's Australian romantic-drama film Holding the Man, as Bob Caleo. The 2015 film stars Ryan Corr and Craig Stott, with supporting performances from LaPaglia, Guy Pearce and Geoffrey Rush. Holding the Man was adapted from Timothy Conigrave's 1995 memoir of the same name. For his role within the film, LaPaglia was nominated for an AACTA Award for Best Actor in a Supporting Role at the 5th AACTA Awards in 2015. In that year LaPaglia returned to his home city, Adelaide, to star in A Month of Sundays as Frank, a miserable real estate agent who finds solace and redemption in a chance friendship with an elderly woman (played by Julia Blake) who reminds him of his mother. In 2016 he appeared in his first Australian TV series: The Code, a political thriller set against rising geopolitical tensions between the US and China. The following year he starred in the four-part miniseries Sunshine, an Australian crime drama series screened on SBS from Wednesday 18 October 2017, set in the western Melbourne suburb of the same name, playing the role of mentor to a promising young Sudanese-Australian soccer player. The four-part miniseries is an Essential Media production, directed by Daina Reid and written by Matt Cameron and Elise McCredie. In 2018, LaPaglia appeared in the fifth season of the comedy Rake, based loosely on the life and misadventures of Charles Waterstreet.\n\nIn 2017, LaPaglia played Vito Rizzuto in the Simon Barry Canadian TV series Bad Blood, which aired on Citytv, in French on ICI Radio-Canada. From 2017 to 2020, he starred in Neil Jordan's series Riviera. Set in the French Riviera, the series follows Georgina Clios, a midwestern art curator whose life is turned upside down after the death of her billionaire husband Constantine Clios (LaPaglia) in a yacht accident. Georgina becomes immersed in a world of lies, double-dealing and crime, as she seeks to uncover the truth about her husband's death.\n\nIn 2023 LaPaglia appeared in the ABC TV series The Black Hand, which explores the activities of the Italian 'Ndrangheta in the cane fields of Queensland, Australia, in the 1920s and 1930s. The same year, he appeared in his Australian stage debut as Willy Loman in Arthur Miller's play Death of a Salesman at Her Majesty's Theatre, Melbourne, directed by Neil Armfield.\n\nPersonal life\n\nLaPaglia currently lives in Santa Monica, California. He has said that he adopted an American accent to help him get acting work after moving to the US. His current accent is neither distinctly American nor is it Australian, but, rather, a combination of both. According to an offhand remark by LaPaglia, he has employed an American accent since 1982. LaPaglia is the godfather of Poppy Montgomery and Adam Kaufman's son, Jackson. LaPaglia's first marriage was to actress Cherie Michan. His second marriage was to actress Gia Carides, whom he met at a party; the two starred in the 1994 Australian movie Paperback Romance (a.k.a. Lucky Break) and married in 1998. Their daughter Bridget was born in January 2003. In April 2015, newspapers reported that LaPaglia and Carides had split after 17 years. He married Alexandra Henkel (his third marriage), who is 30 years younger, on 28 April 2018.\n\nLife in soccer\n\nIn the 1980s, LaPaglia was a goalkeeper in the National Soccer League, playing for Adelaide City and West Adelaide. LaPaglia was part owner of A-League club Sydney FC until 2008; flying from California to Sydney to attend their matches since their inception in 2005. He was the narrator and executive producer of The Away Game, a critically acclaimed television documentary exploring the experiences of Australian men's soccer players in Europe.\n\nHe plays occasionally with Hollywood United, an amateur organisation of which he is club president, with others in the entertainment industry including Frank Leboeuf, Vinnie Jones, Steve Jones (of the Sex Pistols) and others.\n\nLaPaglia has a minority shareholding in the International Goalkeepers Academy. The Academy was founded and is operated by James Fraser, who represented the Australian national team leading up to the 1974 FIFA World Cup.\n\nLaPaglia has volunteered as an actor with the Young Storytellers Program. He played in a charity soccer match in 2007 to raise funds for Southern California wildfire relief.\n\nOn screen and stage\n\nFilm Year Title Role Notes 1987 Cold Steel 'Spooky' (film debut) Feature film 1988 Nitti: The Enforcer Frank Nitti TV film Police Story: Gladiator School Sergeant Petrelli TV film 1989 Slaves of New York Henry Feature film Mortal Sins Vito 1990 Criminal Justice David Ringel TV film Betsy's Wedding Stevie Dee Feature film 1991 He Said, She Said Mark Feature film One Good Cop Detective Stevie Diroma Feature film 29th Street Frank Pesce Jr. Feature film The Brotherhood Salvatore's Brother TV film Keeper of the City Vince Benedetto TV film 1992 Whispers in the Dark Larry Morgenstern Feature film Innocent Blood Joe Gennaro Feature film Black Magic Ross Gage TV film 1993 So I Married an Axe Murderer Tony Giardino Feature film The Custodian Sergeant James Quinlan Feature film 1994 The Client Barry 'The Blade' Muldano Feature film Lucky Break Eddie Mercer Feature film Bulletproof Heart Mick Feature film Past Tense Larry Talbert TV film Mixed Nuts Felix Feature film 1995 Empire Records Joe Reaves Feature film 1996 Chameleon Willie Serling Feature film Trees Lounge Rob Feature film Brilliant Lies Gary Fitzgerald Feature film Never Give Up: The Jimmy V Story Jimmy 'Jimmy V' Valvano TV film 1997 Commandments Harry Luce Feature film The Garden of Redemption Don Paolo Montale TV film 1998 Phoenix Detective Mike Henshaw Feature film 1999 Lansky Charles \"Lucky\" Luciano TV film Black and Blue Bobby Benedetto TV film Summer of Sam Detective Lou Petrocelli Feature film Sweet and Lowdown Al Torrio Mockumentary film 2000 Company Man Fidel Castro Feature film Looking for Alibrandi Michael Andretti Feature film The House of Mirth Sim Rosedale Feature film Autumn in New York John Feature film 2001 Jack the Dog Jack's Attorney Feature film Lantana Detective Leon Zat Feature film The Bank Simon O'Reily Feature film On the Edge Dr. Maas TV film 2002 The Salton Sea Al Garcetti Feature film Dead Heat Ray LaMarr Feature film Road to Perdition Al Capone Feature film (uncredited) I'm with Lucy Bobby Staley Feature film The Guys Nick Feature film Analyze That Anthony Bella / Nicky Caesar (uncredited cameo) Feature film 2003 Manhood Jack's Attorney Feature film Happy Hour Tulley Feature film Spinning Boris Dick Dresner 2004 Winter Solstice Jim Winters Feature film (also executive producer) 2006 The Architect Leo Waters Feature film Played Detective Drummond Feature film Happy Feet Boss Skua (voice) Animated feature film 2008 $9.99 Jim Peck (voice) Stop motion feature film 2009 Balibo Roger East Feature film (also producer) 2010 Overnight Captain Brody Legend of the Guardians: The Owls of Ga'Hoole Twilight (voice) Animated feature film 2011 All-Star Superman Lex Luthor (voice) Animated feature film Happy Feet Two Alpha Skua (voice) Animated feature film 2012 Long Time Gone (aka Crazy Kind of Love) Gordie Feature film Mental Barry Moochmore Feature film Underground: The Julian Assange Story Detective Ken Roberts TV film Americana Robert Soulter TV film 2013 Boomerang Bill Hamilton TV film 2014 A Good Marriage Bob Feature film Big Stone Gap Spec Broadwater Feature film Newcomer Daniel Red Zone TV film 2015 A Month of Sundays Frank Mollard Feature film (also executive producer) This Isn't Funny Mike Feature film Holding the Man Bob Caleo Feature film The Eichmann Show Leo Hurwitz TV film 2016 The Assignment John 'Honest John' Hartunian Feature film Toy Gun Gaetano Lolli 2017 Annabelle: Creation Samuel Mullins Feature film 2020 Pearl Jack Wolf Feature film 2021 Nitram Maurice Feature film Television Year Title Role Notes 1985 Amazing Stories Mechanic Episode: \"The Mission\" 1986 Magnum, P.I.
