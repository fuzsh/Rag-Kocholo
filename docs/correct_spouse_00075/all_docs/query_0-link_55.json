I think some of the poll will be based on if this is the last eppy ever or not. Thanks for your patience and understanding.\n\nThanks to Mimi and Mouchette for the link to YouTube:\n\nTHE TEAM SEARCHES FOR A MAN WHO DISAPPEARS AFTER A LATE NIGHT DIVE, ON THE SEVENTH SEASON FINALE OF \"WITHOUT A TRACE,\" TUESDAY, MAY 19\n\nAcademy Award Winner Martin Landau (\"Ed Wood\") Reprises His Role as Frank Malone, Jack's Father\n\nAdam Kaufman, Poppy Montgomery's Real-Life Boyfriend, Reprises His Role as Brian Donovan, the Father of Samantha's Son, Finn\n\n\"Undertow\" - The team searches for a man who goes missing after a late night dive and try to zero in on who could be responsible for his disappearance. Meanwhile, Danny and Elena take their relationship to another level, on the seventh season finale of WITHOUT A TRACE, Tuesday, May 19 (10:01-11:00 PM, ET/PT) on the CBS Television Network.\n\nSERIES REGULARS:\n\nJack Malone: Anthony LaPaglia\n\nSamantha Spade: Poppy Montgomery\n\nVivian Johnson: Marianne Jean-Baptiste\n\nDanny Taylor: Enrique Murciano\n\nMartin Fitzgerald: Eric Close\n\nElena Delgado: Roselyn Sanchez\n\nGUEST CAST:\n\nDerek Wilson: Kenneth Mitchell\n\nMarie Feretti: Alicia Leigh Willis\n\nTravis Feretti: Gattlin Griffith\n\nBrian Donovan: Adam Kaufman\n\nHannah Malone: Vanessa Marano\n\nAndrew Reese: Dominic Flores\n\nSocial worker: Samantha Adams\n\nKelly: Amanda Tepe\n\nMrs. Feretti: Loanne Bishop\n\nND Agent: Stacy Kesten\n\nFrank Malone: Martin Landau\n\nWRITTEN BY: Executive producers David Amman & Greg Walker\n\nDIRECTED BY: Jeannot Szwarc\n\nPost by mamu on\n\nCan't say much of the MP/case (Xander from Buffy has totally aged!), it was buried amongst a ton of personal storylines:\n\n1) Danny and Elena's marriage.\n\n2) Hannah wanting to move back to Chicago, and Jack dealing with that and him being a bad\n\ndad.\n\n3) Sam/Brian...him thinking it's time for him to move on/move out, with Sam telling him to stay.\n\n4) Jack and Sam break up. Jack focusing on daughters, Sam wanting to be family. Sam referring to Brian: \"He's no Jack Malone\" ... saying their timing was never right.\n\nJack gets to go \"off the rails\" with the suspect/witness, again. You get to see Martin in a wet suit/in the water...he's the hero for saving the MP.\n\nThere was a nice Jack/Viv scene at the end...almost seemed like they (writers?) knew this could be the last episode?\n\nAs a DE fan, I'm upset that they ended up not showing the actual wedding, but alluded that the whole team would be there.\n\nFinal scene was the camera on the board with the MP photo, and then they changed the photos of the MP to various previous MPs through the years....\n\nIt really felt like a series finale to me. With the last scene, scene with Viv/Jack and the \"tying up\" of the Sam/Jack stuff....\n\nPost by mamu on\n\nSo.... any word on who will be Danny's best man?\n\nAt the beginning of the episode, Elena told Danny that they had to be in line at the courthouse by 5. Elena said Sam was going to be her witness, and she asked Danny who would be his...at that moment, Jack approaches them and Danny said Jack would be.\n\nBut, right before the end...Viv interrupts Sam and Jack's \"heart-to-heart\" to say that she got a call from Elena and they had to get to the courthouse....Martin was already there.\n\nSo, in a nutshell...I have no clue who was the best man ... I'll say Martin for the simple reason that he was at the courthouse already.\n\nPost by mamu on\n\nAny word on Sofie?\n\nNothing. They don't mention her at all, but she could possibly have been at the courthouse...we'll never know, as they didn't show the scene.\n\nI guess it explains why Ashlyn Sanchez wasn't listed in the cast and the whole \"they can't get married in the finale if she's not there\" train of thought...she could have been, we just don't know since they never intended to show it!\n\nPost by mamu on\n\nDid Martin Landau appear? Was it a new scene or a flashback?\n\nNew scene serving as a flashback. It was when young Jack (bad hair!!) was looking at his baby daughter through the glass in the hospital and his dad is there...it had to do with the whole Jack/Hannah/I'm a bad father storyline.\n\nPost by SeptemberBaby on\n\nDid Martin Landau appear?

Malone??\n\nThey should have saved the $$ to have Landau guest star and used it to have Sofie in this episode. I bet she comes a bit cheaper.\n\nPost by SeptemberBaby on\n\nWasn't this the same scene that was in Malone v. Malone??\n\nMaybe it was, I didn't see that episode...so it could have been. Sorry.\n\nI think they had a conversation about her name and how she's named after Jack's grandmother (I think???) It was something about the baby's name. I think?? Now I can't be sure.\n\nPost by cludwig on\n\nI am not sure in which eppy it was, but there was definitely a scene with Jack & his dad looking at babies and Jack's dad asking which one his granddaughter is.\n\nIt would seem to me that they used an already existing scene, because I am pretty sure Martin Landau doesn't come cheap and why re-do something if the end result would be very close to an original ? (Hope this makes sense.)"
