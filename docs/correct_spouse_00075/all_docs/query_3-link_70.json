        "text": "SHORT SYNOPSIS\n\nA lonely obese teenager everyone calls \"Butter\" (Alex Kersting) is about to make history. He is going to eat himself to death, live on the Internet, and everyone is invited to watch. When he first makes the announcement, online to his classmates, Butter expects pity, insults, and possibly sheer indifference. What he gets are morbid cheerleaders rallying around his deadly plan. Yet as their dark encouragement grows, it begins to feel a lot like popularity. And that feels good. But what happens when Butter reaches his suicide deadline? Can he live with the fallout if he doesn't go through with his plans?\n\nSYNOPSIS\n\nButter (Alex Kersting) is a smart, funny high school junior who happens to weigh 423 pounds. His eating issues stem from multiple sources, but one day when the pressure becomes too much, he opens a website called Buttersfinalmeal.com. Here he invites his classmates to watch as he consumes his last meal on New Year's Eve, literally eating himself to death. The overwhelming positive reaction to his posting astonishes him, and he becomes an instant member of the in crowd (Jack Griffo and Adain Bradley). But even finding the friendship he craves doesn't help ease his internal pain. His mom (Mira Sorvino) still supplies him with high-calorie \"comfort\" foods; his dad (Brian Van Holt) still looks at him in disgust, and Anna (McKaley Miller), the most beautiful girl at school, won't give him a second glance. His doctor (Ravi Patel) and his music teacher (Mykelti Williamson) are his only mentors, but he keeps them in the dark about his deadly plan. Playing his saxophone and spending time as his online alter ego, JP, a tall, athletic hunk who chats for hours online with Anna, provide the only real comforts in his life.\n\nThe story heads toward a frightening climax as Butter discovers that his newfound friends are just as cruel in their own way as those who abused him in the past. The ending leaves Butter realistically examining his options for the future.\n\nBased on the Best-Selling YA novel of the same name by Erin Jade Lange.\n\nDIRECTOR STATEMENT BY PAUL A. KAUFMAN\n\n“You think I eat a lot now? That’s nothing. Tune in December 31st, when I will stream a live webcast of my last meal. Death row inmates get one. Why shouldn’t I? I can’t take another year in this fat suit, but I can end this year with a bang. If you can stomach it, you’re invited to watch…as I eat myself to death.” — Butter\n\nGobsmacked! That’s how I felt when I first read this quote from Erin Lange’s novel, BUTTER. I was surfing Amazon looking for a book to option to adapt into my next film. My kids were 17 and 19 and I wanted something that could affect them in a positive way but nothing too soft or too dark. I searched words like “reliance”, “bullying”, “self-esteem”, “family issues” and such. I spent days going from book to book searching for that connection to a story I wanted to tell - ultimately a story that could “inspire”, a theme that resonates with most of my work. That was when I found Butter or as I put it, Butter found me.\n\nWho was this “Butter” and how on earth can he eat himself to death? And why? I had to know. I ordered the book.\n\nAs I read the book my stomach turned with each page. I was hooked - big time. I was instantly drawn in to Butter and his plight. I was witnessing and feeling his pain, then his joy. The book tells the story from the first person. Butter’s voice is funny and irreverent. Although I am not obese, I empathize with him. Who did not feel left out in High School? Who has not felt marginalized? Who in some way has not felt bullied? Unaccepted? Gawked at? Lonely? Even considered suicide? I know I have.\n\nThe details of Butter’s life, his struggles plus the humor give the film an authenticity that I hope will make it powerful and emotional. His story is so original and represents everything I want to say as a film maker. Making this movie can affect change. The experience I'm most trying to communicate with Butter is that of acceptance. While this film is a journey towards suicide, it’s about beginnings, change, and how deeply funny life can be in its most serious moments. I knew I had to make a choice between a darker film and one that would resonate with a teenage audience. My main goal was to get the quality of a John Hughes movie and make it comedic.\n\nWhile writing the screenplay, I met Christina Sibul. She had read the book, loved it, and want to be involved. She helped along the way in developing the script. When the script was finished, rather than make it with another production company to finance the film privately, we reached out to J. Todd Harris at Branded Pictures Entertainment. Todd loved the script and decided to produce the film together with Christina. When it came to financing the movie, we reached out to the people that would be most affected by the content. This included family, friends, friends of friends, childhood dentists, old high school friends, etc. Because it was such a low budget movie, we knew that we needed additional help. We found that help with some big resources in LA, including Panavision, FotoKem, Santa Clarita Studios, and many others.\n\nWe were very lucky to find such an amazing cast. We did an international search for an actor to play Butter. We received auditions from Australia, England, and ended up finding Alex in Las Vegas after he had driven out twice for screen tests. From the moment we met him, we knew he was Butter. We put Alex with an acting coach, Myra Turley, who also happened to be the mother of our amazing casting director, Tannis Vallely. In regard to Butter as a musician, we really wanted him to have a unique sound. We looked at a lot of different options because we didn’t want him to be just another saxophone player. We found Rocco Barbato on YouTube. He was based on Vegas and had a unique tone to his music. He has a real energy, strength, and confidence to his playing. Rocco worked with Alex on teaching him how to play the sax, as well as wrote all of the saxophone compositions for the film. Everything was pre-recorded. Another interesting element is our use of prosthetics in the film. Butter weighed 430 pounds and Alex weighed 100 pounds less. We had to get him a prosthetic suit. We received a quote for $65K but could only budget $5K. Through a friend of a friend, we met with Bill Bryan. He loved the script and agreed to make the suit for a fraction of the cost.\n\nWith all of these elements in place, we were finally ready to begin production. We shot the movie in 18 days in Los Angeles. The cast and crew were amazing. Everyone got along, which made the shoot very smooth. Working with Mira Sorvino was a treat. She really designed and created the character of Marian. We spoke on the phone when she took the part and had some great ideas. In the scene where she’s showing her photograph, she came up with that the night before and shot it on her iPhone. Her dedication was very much appreciated. I personally called Mykelti Williamson to play Professor Dunn and was thrilled when he accepted. McKaley Miller, who plays Anna McGinn, came in and read with Butter for his screen test. After auditioning dozens of girls, we went with her because she shined. Jake Walker who plays the bully, Jeremy, also came in for the screen test to help out as the reader and ended up getting the role. Both were right in front of us the whole time. Brian Van Holt and Annabeth Gish were also terrific to work with. Both were very dedicated to the film and were a joy to have on set.\n\nThe script attracted a lot of people because it’s so much more than a movie. It is art meeting advocacy. Even though we are telling a story, we all want to be involved because it deals with body positivity and mental illness, while also preventing teen suicide. The whole is greater than the sum of its parts, and this movie had all the right parts. Everyone involved was highly aware and supportive of the message we wanted to send. As part of our advocacy, we partnered with the JED Foundation. JED exists to protect emotional health and prevent suicide for our nation’s teens and young adults. They have been our nonprofit partner since the completion of the script. We want to make sure we were being socially responsible while dealing with such important issues. With them, we knew we were in good hands. The JED Foundation has a secondary foundation called SeizeTheAwkward.org. It deals with teenage anxiety and how that can prevent teens from being able to discuss their problems. A lot of their online content is comedic in nature, while staying true to the overall message. We thought this overlap was very fitting for out film.\n\nWhen production was finished, we began the editing process with Garry M.B. Smith. Jeff Toyne did an amazing job with the composition of the movie. The soundtrack has over 30 songs, all of which were unknown artists found on Spotify. Each were contacted directly. I also had a family member involved with the Pentatonix. They gave us a song that is found in the end credits. Another example of people loving the film and the message and wanting to get involved.\n\nBullying has become an epidemic. Many children are victims of sexual bullying and cyber bullying, and overweight children are especially targeted. The alarming statistics on bullying are upsetting. In a recent national survey of overweight sixth graders, 30 percent experienced daily teasing, bullying or rejection because of their size. The number doubles for overweight high school students.\n\nWe need to teach our children to be kind. To accept others how they are. To stand up for others. It starts there. To show a simple act of kindness and acceptance. This may be the ray of hope a desperate teen might need. Befriend the Butters of the world.\n\nButter will capture our hearts. His story will capture our minds. It’s an important story to tell with a powerful message.\n\nAnd let’s not forget to sit back and enjoy a really good film.\n\nTHE FILMMAKERS\n\nPAUL A.

However, she showed interest in a career in acting from an early age, and moved to New York City to try her hand in the Big Apple’s film industry, waitressing, auditioning and working at the Tribeca production company of Robert De Niro. She succeeded in getting a little television work in the early 1990s, but got her first film job in the independent gangster movie Amongst Friends, on which she worked her way up the ladder behind the camera to eventually associate-produce the film, and, more importantly, was eventually cast as the female lead. The indie production was well-received, and Sorvino's performance attracted enough buzz to get her cast in two more movies, one a more prominent indie, Barcelona, the other, her first Hollywood feature, Quiz Show.\n\nAn exceptionally poised and articulate young woman, she may have seemed inappropriate to play a crazy hooker, but Woody Allen took the chance, and her magnificent performance as the female lead in his Mighty Aphrodite proved her range as a performer and earned her an Oscar™ for Best Supporting Actress.

KAUFMAN - See Director’s statement above.\n\nJ. TODD HARRIS\n\n“When Paul first introduced me to this movie, he said it was 'noisy' and he was right. Watching him adapt this powerful book and will this movie into existence was inspirational for me - and I've worked on a lot of independent features. The care, the attention to detail, the focus on the overall message - all of the highest caliber. I'm honored to be a part of this movie and proud to have helped Paul realize it. It's a film everyone in high school (or who has ever been to high school) should see.\"\n\nCHRISTINA SIBUL\n\n“I was attracted to the story because I love working on young adult material in terms of their stories. Our lead character learns deeply about himself and how to be authentic and honest. Hopefully, this film can start a conversation where we can talk about childhood obesity, suicide, bullying and other issues. One of the major components to this story is that the bullying starts to look a lot like cheerleading, except cheering him on is leading him to a negative end. We started our schedule with most of the adult, seasoned actors working first and it’s been amazing to watch Mira Sorvino bringing life and humor to her character, even though the subject matter is dark. She brings depth to the story, range, intelligence, life and humor. Mira has such an empathetic take on the character, and I can see her thought processes working on her character’s journey. It’s been lovely to see Alex work with these talented pros and it has greatly benefited our production and enhanced his performance. The character of Butter is very similar to what Alex went through in high school, where most people didn’t get to see the real Alex. He’s warm, open and engaging. Alex has a real vulnerability, but he also a very funny person who now in his early ‘20s has a great sense of who he is. We live in a much harder dog eat dog world, because kids are visually out there on social media. I believe that we’re having a positive dialogue going on out there but we still have a long way to go.”\n\nERIN JADE LANGE\n\n\"I came up with the idea of writing BUTTER when I was working in TV news at the time, covering almost daily stories about teen suicide, internet bullying and childhood obesity. These stories took root in the back of my mind until they exploded out into this story.\"\n\n\"I was thrilled when Paul first contacted me about making a movie about the book but also disappointed because, at the time, the book was already optioned for film. I wanted to work with Paul instead, but I didn't think he would be willing to wait a year on the option. It was amazing when he followed up a year later, still excited about the story!\"\n\n\"I never even imagined that one of my books would become a movie. Being a published author has been my dream come true, and seehe ding my first story made into a movie is really just bigger than I ever dared to dream.\"\n\n\"What an amazing experience it was to visit the set! The moment I turned the corner to the courtyard where filming was underway will be forever frozen in my memory. It took my breath away to see all of the cast and crew, the set, the equipment. Writing a book is such a solitary thing. Seeing how many people it takes to bring that story to the screen is humbling.\"\n\n\"I thought actors accurately represented the way I wrote the characters. It is so well cast. Everyone fits their roles just as I imagined, but the actors also brought new things to the characters that I love. It's like watching the characters I wrote, except amplified and made even more complex.\"\n\n\"I am so grateful to Paul for consulting with me as he worked on the script. Many authors sign away their books with no assurance of how those stories will be translated. Paul was very generous in letting me be part of the process. I trusted him to make the changes necessary for the screen, and he added some moments that I now wish were in the book! Above all, it was amazing to put Butter in the hands of someone else who loves this story and \"gets\" these characters.\"\n\n\"The movie didn't feel low-budget to me! From the professionalism I saw on set to the amazing final product on the screen, nothing about this movies seemed like it was made on the cheap. I think when something is made with HEART, that has a greater impact on the end result than how much it cost.\"\n\nMIRA SORVINO\n\n“Marian believes that to keep Butter’s love, she needs to give him whatever he wants, which includes feeding him constantly whatever he wants.”\n\n“I cried when I first read the script. It was so beautiful and poignant, but sad, because it’s about human pain and suicide. But, on a lighter note, it’s also funny. It’s a slice of life on being a teenager today. Part of Marian’s problem is she is an enabler who creates all sorts of wacky food art which she serves to him. In that aspect, to her, food is love, and in my real family that was always the case. That’s how a lot of families expressed their love in order to make everyone happy. But Butter does have this issue with weight and she’s really not helping him.”\n\n“As a mother, I have teenaged daughters who sometimes make me feel like I’m an outsider, and I’m often feeling that I’m growing away from them. As the film progresses, she realizes that she’s not helping her son and she’s trying desperately to fix it. Marian is a little daft and she wants to be the perfect mother. But as time goes on, she’s able to admit some things to Butter and her husband and is working very hard to make things right.”\n\n“This movie confronts so many topical issues. I don’t think phones and computers have made anyone any happier. There’s a lot of anonymous hate out there and these folks would not be that ruthless right to your face. It’s so easy to write something mean and then move on to the next tweet or text. We really have to reach out to people who need help and I hope this movie tells these people that they are unique, and there are a lot of ways to climb out of depression. You are never alone and there is community out there to help.”\n\nMYKELTI WILLIAMSON\n\n“I’ve worked with Paul before and he pitched me the story, then sent me the script and two hours later I said I’m in. The story grabbed me immediately and would not let my heart go. I actually feel privileged to be a cast member. Butter absolutely ranks among the most important projects I’ve done.”\n\n“I think Dunn is the most empathetic character in the film in regard to Butter. He understands that everyone has value, everyone is someone’s child. He believes in Butter and his future, and does everything in his power to help this young man navigate this tough terrain.”\n\n“I’m a people person. Years ago, I came to fully understand the intrinsic value of using one’s own life experiences to elevate the lives of others. I saw that same quality in the Professor Dunn character.”\n\n“I have not been in a movie like this since ‘Forrest Gump.’ Butter is a different person’s journey, but it will land on you in many ways that ‘Gump’ did, and it will be a shame if people don’t go see it.”\n\n“I’m a longtime Mira fan because she’s that rare and unique balance of classis movie star meets girl next door. I found Alex’s creativity a breath of fresh air…and boy was it fun to watch him navigate Butter’s journey so beautifully.”\n\nBRIAN VAN HOLT\n\n“Reading the script brought up a lot of anger in me, triggering issues I had as teenager battling anxiety and fear. It elicited many emotions in me.”\n\n“Butter and Frank’s relationship is very strained. To him, Butter is a big disappointment because he’s not a mini-Frank. Once a rising football player, Frank suffered a concussion, which caused him to be blind in one eye, making him bitter and struggling with his own fears. He has a hard time relating to Butter and disconnects from his son’s life, and it’s very sad. I think that this story is about consequences and how your actions affect you and everyone around you and at times it’s painful to watch.”\n\n“There’s a saying ‘pain is the cornerstone of change’ and this is something within him that forces Frank to wake up and be a father.”\n\nANNABETH GISH\n\n“I had an emotional, visceral reaction to the script and I just couldn’t say no. I have two sons, so I’m aware of bullying and cyberbullying and I know how important it is to counteract these problems. It’s so crucial to be mentally healthy. It’s imperative to find kindness as parents, friends, and co-workers.”\n\nALEX KERSTING\n\n“The first time I read the script wasn’t until after I’d already read the book. Erin just poured her heart out into Butter and you couldn’t help but feel all those really strong gutsy emotions hearing his side of the story and how he was dealing with everything. Paul managed to get everything into that script… You can’t help but have a visceral reaction to this type of story. I was literally in tears shooting a couple of the scenes let alone reading it. There’s so much emotion in this entire story. “\n\n“I wasn’t completely sure I could handle the challenge of this complex character, since I’ve never done anything quite like this before. But the initial meeting with Paul by Skype changed my mind and it brought out the fact that there are a lot of similarities between Butter and myself.”\n\n“Butter has all these issues, but he has to be true to himself, so his family and friends can be true to him. I think that this story is about consequences and how your actions affect you and everyone around you. I have gone through depression myself, so I know how dark things can get.”\n\n“Working with Mira, Mykelti and the rest of the seasoned ‘adults’ has been such an amazing learning experience for me. It has been magical for me just being in the same room with them.”\n\n“Anyone who has ever had to deal with any issues in high school is going to see themselves in Butter. Anyone who has ever been online (and that’s pretty much everyone) must make a point to see this film.”\n\nMCKALLEY MILLER\n\n“Anna is sort of the girl next door, but still in the popular crowd - she has the best of both worlds. She also has a tendency to sometimes fall into the wrong crowd. She’s a caring person and she takes to Butter in ways she wouldn’t expect.”\n\n“My character is relatable to me and I think will be to the audience, because she is like every other girl who is trying to find her place. She meets JP (Butter) online and feels him emotionally, although she doesn’t know what he looks like. But Butter is catfishing her, so he is basically doing something similar to the bullying he’s getting at school. Anna has fallen into a trap that Butter has set for her.”\n\n“This story offers so many issues that audiences can take something away from. I would love to see a change in the way that we treat people. We kind of popularize morbid, dark things and I wonder, why do we do it? Everyone has a little part of sadness inside of them. BUTTER is dark at times, but I hope that people will become more empathetic and see where people are at different stages in their life before jumping to conclusions.”\n\nABOUT THE BOOK AND AUTHOR\n\nERIN JADE LANGE, Author Erin Jade Lange is the award-winning author of contemporary young adult novels, Butter, Dead Ends, and Rebel Bully Geek Pariah. She is the winner of the Friedolin Youth Book Prize in Germany and the Sakura Medal in Japan. She has also been nominated for the Waterstones Children’s Book Prize (twice), the German Children’s Literature Award and multiple state book awards. Her debut novel was a 2013 Teens’ Top Ten Pick, and her books have appeared on several state reading lists. As a former journalist, Erin is inspired by current events and real-world issues and uses her writing to explore how those issues impact teenagers. She is an only child, so she spent a lot of time entertaining herself as a kid. This required her to rely heavily on her own imagination, which is probably why she became a writer. Erin grew up in the cornfields of northern Illinois, along the Mississippi River in one of the few places it flows east to west. She now lives in the sunshine of Arizona and will forever be torn between her love of rivers and her love of the desert.\n\nBOOK AWARDS • 2016 Abraham Lincoln Masterlist\n\n• 2016 Nevada Young Readers Award nominee\n\n• 2015-2016 Iowa High School Book Award nominee\n\n• 2015 Sakura Medal winner\n\n• 2015 High School Sequoyah Masterlist\n\n• Waterstones Children’s Book Prize nominee 2014\n\n• 2014-2015 South Carolina Young Adult Book Award nominee\n\n• 2014 Blue Hen Book Award nominee\n\n• 2014 TAYSHAS List\n\n• 2013 Teens’ Top Ten Pick\n\nSELECT BOOK REVIEWS “Using current, hot-button topics–cyberbullying, obesity, and teen suicide the author weaves a compelling tale sure to draw teens in.” – School Library Journal STARRED Review\n\n“Dark, funny, painful, and powerful.” – Publishers Weekly\n\n“Butter is a darkly humorous tale of bullying, obesity and the craving for popularity in the Internet age.
