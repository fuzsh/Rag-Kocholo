        "text": "(no subject) - instantsarcasm\n\nIt bugs me when they say \"longtime boyfriend.\" Because usually it's about people who've been dating for like...a year. Three years isn't a \"long time\" to me. Tim Robbins and Kurt Russell are \"longtime boyfriends.\"\n\nIs the phrase supposed to calm people who freak out about a woman having a baby with a man that she's not married to?\n\nI totes agree. This has been a pet peeve of mine for ages.\n\ncurrently cohabitate in L.A.\n\nthat made me laugh for some reason. This article is oddly written lmao.\n\nI know! 'Native Australian' just sounds weird. :)\n\nBeautiful couple ♥\n\nHe'll always be Parker from Buffy to me.\n\nHa! Me too. I just commented that below :)\n\nDitto.\n\nSame. I need to stop thinking he's an asshole because of his one role in Buffy. The fact that he's dating Poppy lessens his assholiness.\n\nKaufman's credits include guest spots on Veronica Mars, Law & Order, Mad Men, CSI: NY, Monk and, playing a bartender who's been a little slow in signing those papers relinquishing his custodial rights, Without a Trace.\n\nAND \"Buffy the Vampire Slayer\". I can never see this actor and not see \"Parker\", even though he's gotten MUCH better looking since his time during Buffy's 4th season.\n\ni loved her in dead man on campus.\n\nI remember him on Dawson's Creek.\n\nI remember him as Parker on Buffy, but who was he on Veronica Mars?\n\nHe was in The Girl Next Door in season 1...the artist boyfriend of the pregnant girl.\n\nAh, thank you. I think I need to dig out my S1 dvd and re-watch them all.\n\nNo prob! I should rewatch it too, I <3 season 1.\n\nI watch that show religiously.\n\nI was wondering when she was going to have the baby! I like the name Jackson Phillip. Good for them!\n\nIsn't that the guy Buffy dated and ignored her??? Also Jack McPhee's first gay kis?? If so, he's not in Veronica Mars, he only did the pseudo pilot for seaosn 4.\n\nYes, that's him. And he was on Veronica; he was Andre in The Girl Next Door.\n\nLove love love Poppy Montgomery. There is just something about her that is very alluring and fascinating. Love her as Samantha Spade on Without a Trace as well. It's one of my favorite shows.\n\nThey look so cute together. I could care less if they aren't married. It's a piece of paper that gives tax benefits and health benefits. That's about it.\n\nAt least their kid has a normal name.\n\nIt was a such a surprise to see him on Mad Men as that salesman. If I were Betty Draper, I'd have that fantasy too (rawr). He has gotten way hotter since his Buffy days.\n\nTheir baby must be beautiful. Congrats to them!"
