        "text": "It's been a busy year for Poppy Montgomery. The Without a Trace star became a mom on screen and off, welcoming son Jackson on December 23 and giving birth to a son on the drama's season finale in May. \"I feel really lucky,\" Montgomery says. \"I love my family, I love my job. I'm a lucky person.\" Here, she shares her feelings on Trace's Sam Spade, motherhood and her babies' daddy. (Without a Trace airs Tuesdays at 10 pm/ET on CBS.)\n\nTV Guide: What's the most surprising thing about motherhood?\n\nPoppy Montgomery: I didn't realize how hard it would be to leave him, even for a minute. I also didn't realize how much fun it would be. I thought it would be a lot of hard work, which it is. But it is also really fun.\n\nTV Guide: Is there something your parents taught you that you want to teach Jackson?\n\nMontgomery: My parents taught me fearlessness.... They taught me about love, about work, about everything. My main concern is for him to know that he is loved.\n\nTV Guide: What was the biggest surprise for Sam last season?\n\nMontgomery: Her pregnancy! She had to decide whether or not she was ready to be a mother. And I guess the audience was surprised to find out who the father was.\n\nTV Guide: That brought Adam Kaufman (Brian), the father of your child in real life and on screen, back. How was it to work with him again?\n\nMontgomery: It was so much fun. I was a little nervous this time. I didn't want to mess up my lines and look like a fool! I wanted him to think I was good.\n\nTV Guide: Has parenthood changed your relationship?\n\nMontgomery: I just think that I love Adam more. I see how great a father he is. You realize that you're linked together for life. No matter what, you share a child.\n\nTV Guide: Do you plan to marry?\n\nMontgomery: I'm sort of OK either way. I think for Jackson it might be important at some stage that we get married. But there is no rush.\n\nTV Guide: Where do Sam and Jack (Anthony LaPaglia) stand?\n\nMontgomery: I love their relationship. It never really evolved, that's the problem. I think we're going to see some resolution soon. She's always been in love with him and always will be.\n\nCheck out full episodes and clips of Without a Trace in our Online Video Guide.\n\nSign up now for our free Daily Scoop e-mail newsletter to get the inside scoop."
