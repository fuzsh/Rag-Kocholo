Hollywood actress Poppy Montgomery, and her husband, Microsoft executive Shawn Sanford, welcomed their son Gus Monroe Deveraux on November 11 – quite aptly, on Remembrance Day, sometimes known as Poppy Day! Gus Sanford joins big sister Violet, aged 19 months, whose birth was featured on the blog, and big brother Jackson, aged 6, who is Poppy’s son from a previous relationship to Adam Kaufman, as well as siblings Hayley and Brandon from Shawn’s previous marriage.

During her pregnancy, Poppy wrote a blog post on choosing the perfect baby name, something which she feels very strongly about. Her own name has caused her a few unhappy moments, and she believes a badly-matched first name and surname can be a terrible mistake (she still shudders at how close she came to calling her first son Jack Kaufman). There’s information on why she chose Violet Grace for her daughter, and some sensible advice on choosing baby names. She’s certainly done a great job on Gus Monroe.
