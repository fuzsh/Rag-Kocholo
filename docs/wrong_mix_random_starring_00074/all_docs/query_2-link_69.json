        "text": "Download Comparison Guide\n\nProduct Overview\n\nInfor ERP is a robust suite of enterprise resource planning (ERP) applications designed to help distribution and manufacturing companies run core business operations. Its main ERP offering includes CloudSuites. Infor’s CloudSuites are comprehensive industry suites geared toward manufacturing, service and distribution industries.\n\nEach CloudSuite has its own unique set of features. These integrated features offer visibility into several business facets, from accounting and human resource management to sourcing, projects, customer relationship management (CRM) and supply chain.\n\nIn addition, the solution’s analytics accelerate processes using preconfigured dashboards, key performance indicators (KPIs), reports and other tools that help users take advantage of Infor’s functionality in the shortest time possible. Companies can also drill down into analytics information to take appropriate action after gaining insight.\n\nFeatures\n\nInfor ERP comes with full functionality for small and medium-sized businesses and enterprise-level organizations.\n\nSome of its key features include:\n\nAdvanced planning & scheduling – Infor ERP allows users to immediately determine if they have the workforce, machines, tools and materials needed to manufacture a product. Users can track product demand as it rises. Before committing to an unplanned order, users can see the ripple effect it’ll have on their shop floor and schedule so expectations can be set with existing customers beforehand. If a piece of equipment goes down, users can alter production schedules immediately. Through it all, Infor ERP boosts productivity, increases on-time delivery and improves order accuracy.\n\nHuman capital management (HCM) – Many industries rely on consistent service, and today’s buyers are more informed and expect quick delivery at a lower cost. Therefore, matching personnel to demand and understanding talent capabilities are crucial to success. Infor ERP includes HCM solutions that support a user’s need for a comprehensive view of the talent base so the right staff can be attracted, hired and retained.\n\nPrebuilt industry analytics – Infor provides clients with robust prebuilt industry analytics data by domain and industry that works across business systems and makes crucial information easily accessible for all stakeholders. Users can navigate and measure multidimensional data with a set of predefined chart templates or drill down into data on an ad-hoc basis. In addition, analytics allow companies to configure dashboards and create reports with industry data models, operational metrics, strategic KPIs, and a library of widgets and charts.\n\nWorkforce planning – Infor’s workforce planning capability allows manufacturers and distributors to optimize their headcount to meet scheduling criteria, so they always have the right number of staff members at the right time. This feature makes it possible to manage production line requirements, as well as address actual and planned coverage gaps. In addition, workforce planning helps organizations discover how many individuals are required for both direct and indirect labor to best conduct a demand forecast.\n\nTarget Market\n\nInfor ERP is primarily intended for small and midsized companies, but it can scale to cater to the needs of larger organizations. Here’s a list of its notable customers:\n\nImplementation/Integration\n\nInfor offers the following deployment options:\n\nOn-premise – With on-premise deployment, Infor runs on internal servers hosted at locations the client controls. Clients’ systems, processes and users are connected through internal infrastructure. Organizations often opt for on-premise deployment when they want to host their data internally, or if specific third parties or customers require it.\n\nCloud – In cloud ERP deployment, Infor’s suites are hosted by a cloud services provider, and the solution’s maintenance and daily operations are outsourced. Infor works with Amazon Web Services, known for its world-class cloud infrastructure. Companies choosing this implementation get the option to scale capability as needs change, which results in lower total cost of ownership (TCO).\n\nHybrid – With a hybrid implementation, some of the client’s software applications are hosted on-premise while others are deployed in the cloud. Some organizations prefer hosting applications (e.g., CRM) in the cloud, while deploying core systems, such as ERP, on-premise. Companies choose this strategy when they want to take a calculated approach to moving to the cloud or when they’re duty-bound to host specific forms of data internally.\n\nCustomer Service & Support\n\nBy dialing their local Infor support number, customers can get in touch with Infor’s trained support specialists, who offer personalized support on a daily basis.\n\nInfor offers Elite Support to its dedicated customers. This option includes a designated Customer Success Manager who serves as the customer’s advocate. Success Managers have a deep understanding of Infor’s products.\n\nAdditionally, Infor has a support portal for its customers. It’s an all-in-one hub that gives users access to all support resources, from customer communities and service packs to software patches and more.\n\nInfor’s Knowledge Base is updated daily, and it’s where customers can find the Infor Support Assistant – an innovative application that’s synced with their respective Infor applications to help Infor proactively manage their upgrades and issues.\n\nPricing\n\nInfor doesn’t publicly disclose its pricing information. Contact the vendor directly for a quote.\n\nShortcomings\n\nInfor ERP doesn’t have full functionality with Excel. Users have the option to export to Excel, but specific screens don’t have an export feature.\n\nSome users have also said that running reports and background tasks can consume large amounts of IT resources, slowing operations for other users, so they must be performed after-hours.\n\nScreenshots\n\nAbout\n\nInfor is a global leader in business cloud software products for companies in industry specific markets. It builds complete industry suites in the cloud and efficiently deploys technology that puts the user experience first, leverages data science, and integrates easily into existing systems.\n\nOver 60,000 organizations worldwide rely on Infor to help overcome market disruptions and achieve business-wide digital transformation.\n\nDownload Comparison Guide\n\nSend feedback or corrections to feedback@betterbuys.com.\n\nRelated Solutions"
