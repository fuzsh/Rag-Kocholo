Infor has prioritized beauty as a competence, providing a look-and-feel that represents accessibility, openness, and agility in a crisp, straightforward way.\n\nAbout Infor\n\nInfor is the third-largest provider of enterprise applications and services, helping 70,000 customers in 194 countries improve operations, drive growth, and quickly adapt to changes in business demands.
