        "text": "SEE ALSO: Jewelry Brand Cadar Opening First Retail Store at 875 Washington Street\n\nThe software company first moved into SL Green (SLG)’s building between West 19th and West 20th streets in 2012, and expanded its space the next year, as Commercial Observer previously reported.\n\nInfor’s renewal is the latest in a slew of deals SL Green signed recently. MSD Partners, Mamoura Holdings and Nearwater Capital all recently signed leases at One Vanderbilt, while British jeweler Vashi opened its first U.S. location at 110 Greene Street in SoHo.\n\nSL Green also joined the growing number of landlords and brokerages jumping into the flex office space market, and said it would dedicate a full floor of One Vanderbilt to its Altus Suites platform.\n\nSavills’ Jim Wenk and Kirill Azovtsev, along with JLL (JLL)’s Brannan Moss, represented Infor in the deal; SL Green handled it in-house via Jeremy Bier and Steven Durels.\n\nA spokesperson for JLL did not respond to a request for comment. Representatives for Savills and SL Green declined to comment."
