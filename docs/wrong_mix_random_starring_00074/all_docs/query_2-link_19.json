        "text": "SEE ALSO: Carter’s Takes 25K-SF Office at ESRT’s 1350 Broadway [Infor] “has grown exponentially to accommodate the demand for their business base,” Bruce Mosler of Cushman & Wakefield told Commercial Observer. He represented the tenant along with colleagues Mark Mandell, Doron Etzioni and Ethan Silverstein.\n\nThe seventh and eighth floor space will be used by Infor’s Hook & Loop division, which focuses on changing the way “workers interact with software” and has grown to over 80 employees, according to an Infor spokesman.\n\nThe penthouse at SL Green Realty Group’s 635-641 Avenue of the Americas follows Infor’s previous expansion at the same address late last year, as Commercial Observer previously reported, which doubled the company’s space to 92,246 square feet.\n\nThe 271,000-square-foot property is now 100 percent leased, the building owner’s leasing director Steven Durels, told the Post. The adjoining buildings are being redeveloped as one property.\n\nSL Green’s multi-million capital improvement project at 635-641 Avenue of the Americas includes infrastructure improvements, along with high-end amenities such as the glass duplex penthouse and a rooftop space with bocce ball court, according to a spokesman for JLL.\n\nRedevelopments have made the historic property, “one of the nicest buildings in Midtown South,” Mr. Mosler, some of which include a new lobby and penthouse, along with a revitalized façade.\n\nPaul Glickman of JLL represented building ownership in the transaction, along with a team including Diana Biasotti.\n\nMr. Durels didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment."
