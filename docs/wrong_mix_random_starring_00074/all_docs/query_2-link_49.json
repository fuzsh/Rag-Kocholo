        "text": "My name is Darrell Caho and I am the Safety Officer at the Hopedale Medical Complex. I am writing this letter today just to let you know how great your service is and how much easier you make my life as a Safety Officer in a healthcare facility. Your recall alert system is up-to-date, in real time, smooth and user-friendly. I almost feel like I am cheating. All the information I need to keep my staff and our patients safe is literally one click away. The accuracy of each recall including lot numbers and date ranges insures that we know exactly where we stand and prevents loss of man hours in order to narrow down specific items. In short, it’s amazing. Safety is important everywhere, but doubly so in the healthcare industry. Your system and your support team have enabled us to be confident and proficient; offering the best products and environment to people during some of their most troubling times. That is invaluable. Thank you.\n\n​\n\nDarrell R. Caho\n\nSafety Officer/Emergency Preparedness Chairman\n\nHopedale Medical Complex\n\nI just wanted to let you know that the National Recall Alert Center site is working very well for us here at Flambeau Hospital. The alerts are received promptly and are addressed by designated staff in a timely manner. The site is very user friendly and our personal liaison is quite knowledgeable and answers all of our questions quickly.\n\nSo far, the National Recall Alert Center has met and exceeded our needs and expectations and it also plays a very important part in providing quality care to our patients.\n\n​\n\nEden Hewitt, Administrative Coordinator for Compliance and Education\n\nFlambeau Hospital\n\nPO Box 310\n\nPark Falls, WI 54552\n\nHaving National Recall Alert Center's E.-C.L.A.S.S. Alerting, Management, Tracking & Tracing System has actually allowed me to sleep at night. Before NRAC, I was always worried that we would have hospital products under recall of which we might not have been informed. That is no longer the case. What a relief since we all know how non-responsive manufacturers are and how late the FDA is in getting out any information.\n\nI love the fact that your service encompasses every single department within our facility.\n\nAlso, I was very impressed at how long it took my staff and me to fully learn the E.-C.L.A.S.S. system—only 8 minutes!! Yes, yours is the most user-friendly and the most intuitive system I've seen.\n\nNow that I have NRAC and its Triple Alerting Feature, I NO LONGER have to be concerned with not being informed of Class 1 recalls which could lead to patient death. Simply stated, no other organization I've seen comes close to all the features and benefits I am now enjoying with NRAC.\n\nBy the way, your customer service is second to none! Having my own personal liaison at your home office is outstanding and I, for one, appreciate it very much (and so does my entire staff and stakeholders).\n\nAgain thank you so much for helping to reduce the recall risk to our patients and staff—it was a great decision for us and we haven't regretted it one bit!\n\n​\n\nMel Li, Director of Quality Management\n\nCornerstone Hospital Medical Center\n\n2001 Hermann Drive\n\nSuite 100\n\nHouston, TX 77004\n\nI truly want to praise the NRAC recall system. Following several years of working closely with one of NRAC’s competitors we decided to look into other electronic recall alert systems. The system we were using was “good” and we thought it was state-of-the-art. Within minutes of speaking with you over the phone and having you walk me through the NRAC system I could easily see that NRAC exceeded the competitors in almost every possible way.\n\nCompetitor:\n\n· Weekly notices sent out every Friday (recalls from all over the country, many of which\n\nwere not even sent to our region)\n\n· Running reports was extremely time-consuming and printing was even more difficult.\n\n· The competitor’s system was very costly.\n\n· Customer service was very good.\n\nNRAC:\n\n· Recall notices are sent out as they become active (more timely) and are only related to\n\nrecalls that impact our specific region, which means less nuisance recalls that have no\n\npossible impact.\n\n· The Class 1 recall alert system is amazing as it provides me with almost immediate\n\nnotification (via text message and telephone notices). The ability to respond within\n\nminutes to a high risk recall is so important to keeping our patients safe.\n\n· Running reports and printing them is simple, immediate and extremely useful to ensure\n\nthat all responsible individuals in the organization are closing the loop on recall\n\nnotifications assigned to them.\n\n· NRAC is much less expensive.\n\n· The customer service exceeds my expectations every time.\n\nReceived: December 22, 2015\n\nThank you, for the nice anniversary card. I have enjoyed working with the team at NRAC and the recall system has made my job so much easier. I especially like how simple the report section is to use.\n\nHappy holidays in the coming months,\n\n​\n\nKevin McQueen, Director of Safety/Environment of Care/Patient Safety Officer\n\nTri-City Medical Center\n\n4002 Vista Way\n\nOceanside, CA 92056\n\n760-940-3076\n\nMy facility was looking for a recall alerting service so we checked all the services available. After our investigation, my committee and I had no trouble deciding that National Recall Alert Center was the only service that matched our needs.\n\nWe wanted a closed-loop, fully compliant service.\n\nWe wanted a service that was cloud-based so that no IT integration was necessary.\n\nWe wanted a service that had no learning curve.\n\nWe wanted a service that was extremely easy and fast to use by all stakeholders.\n\nWe wanted a service that had the most experience in the field—CHECK.\n\nWe wanted a service that provided real-time service—24/7/365 as well as on weekends and holidays.\n\nWe wanted a service that provided for live assistance anytime we needed it via phone email and fax.\n\nWe wanted a service that had a system that virtually made certain we would never miss a class I recall.\n\nWe wanted a service that escalated several times as well as provided for backups.\n\nWe wanted a service that integrated the information we receive from the manufacture into a scannable document to be kept in the same listing file.\n\nWe wanted a service that provided for security of notes that are being kept with the alerts.\n\nEverything we wanted and felt we needed, we get with National Recall Alert Center.\n\nSimply stated, we couldn't be happier! With National Recall Alert Center we not only receive recall alerts but we also receive full recall management, tracking and tracing.\n\n​\n\nBarbara Allday, Purchasing Department\n\nSouth Central Regional Medical Center\n\n1220 Jefferson Street\n\nLaurel, MS 39440\n\nI would like to share a positive experience with our NRAC system. The FDA sent a representative to inquire about a recall and our Materials Management Technician met with them. The Materials Management Director as well as the Risk Management Director were both off-site at a leadership retreat and the technician was unable to reach them for assistance. The Technician knew how to search for a specific recall because he had been educated previously. He said he was nervous but he pulled up the product recall very quickly and easily, and the FDA Representative was pleased with the information provided. The situation could have been very different if the Technician had to go into his director’s office and look for paper files, but because of the ease of use with the NRAC system, the visit was a positive one.\n\n​\n\nCindy Lang, Director of Risk Management/Patient Safety Officer\n\nMedical Center of Lewisville\n\n500 W Main St\n\nLewisville, TX 75057\n\nWe have been using NRAC for a few months already and from the beginning, with the training offered by Mike Kester to the follow up to make sure we do not have any issues navigating the recall alerts pages and performing our job to be in compliance, all the process has been made very simple to follow and easy to work for us.\n\nCertainly it is always a concern when handling recalled products to make sure they are not left on the shelves of hospitals even after the recall has been released, publicized and checked by the facility employees, but I should mention that the NRAC makes this task far less stressful and easier to perform.\n\nThank you for your help and support in such an important job as to handle recall alerts to be in compliance with the FDA and their accreditation organization.\n\n​\n\nAngie Ledesma, Supply Chain Management Coordinator\n\nShriners Hospitals for Children\n\n2425 Stockton Blvd\n\nSacramento, CA 95817\n\n1. We never close - that is very important to you because you, too, never close - you are responsible for the safety and well-being of your patients 24/7/365. We, too, are there protecting you - alerting you on recalled products as soon as we learn of them - 24/7/365. When you have questions of any kind - we are there to answer them for you and your staff 24/7/365. Whenever you need something from you - we have your back 24/7/365.\n\n2. We have built relationships with manufacturers for more than 4 decades. That assures you of receiving faster information on recalled products and it also assures you of receiving perfect and pristine data when such recalls are transmitted to you. Obtaining information directly from the source itself - means much.\n\n3. Our member service is 2nd to no one. We actually assign a personal liaison to each and every hospital facility. That person at one of our offices is, essentially, open ‘your team’ and is someone you will have a relationship with whenever necessary.\n\n4. Our triple alerting feature - unique to National Recall Alert Center assures you will never miss a class I recall. 5. We protect you with our multi-million dollar insurance policy just in the event there is ever a mistake or omission.\n\n5. We are the most experienced in the field and this is not just our specialty - but is the only field we are in. Exclusively.\n\n6. We allow you to try our recall alerting service and system before you ever make a final decision. If you do decide to become a member of National Recall Alert Center, you will not be constrained to a contract if you wish not to have one and you can decide to leave any time you wish if you find a better organization to join.\n\n7. You get the biggest 'bang for the buck' - ours is the least expensive service of its kind and, by far, has many more features than any other organization anywhere.\n\nWe are proud of the fact that, unless you require it, you are never tied in to our system and can leave at any time you feel you wish for any reason at all. We either deserve to keep you as a member, or we don’t. That way, we do our best at all times and we never rest on our laurels. Hospitals have often told us that when they have used other organizations that require contracts, after signing up they were disappointed for one reason or another and couldn’t leave until the end of their contract - sometimes 5 years later. That is never the situation with National Recall Alert Center."
