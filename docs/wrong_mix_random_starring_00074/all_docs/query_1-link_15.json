They recently moved their HQ from Georgia to New York City, and they did so with the help of VOA, a globally known architectural firm. The office is 48,000 sqft and emphasises collaborative working paradigms as much as practically possible.\n\nThe new collaborative layout brings a social essence to the floor, a core component of both Inforâ€™s product capabilities and the way team members develop ideas."
