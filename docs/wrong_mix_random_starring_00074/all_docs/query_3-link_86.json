        "text": "Infor is not only making strides by growing partnerships with notable businesses, but has expanded their own business by opening a new office in Charleston, West Virginia. This office will run cloud applications for U.S. Government Agencies at the federal, state, and local level, as well as with government contractors in the public sector. The company already has ties with the state, as Infor’s Coleman Artificial Intelligence Platform is named after the inspiring physicist and mathematician Katherine Coleman Johnson, whose trail-blazing work at NASA helped U.S. astronauts land on the moon. Coleman earned her bachelors in mathematics and French with the highest honors from West Virginia State College (now West Virginia State University). Additionally, Infor is partnering with Marshall University in Huntington, West Virginia, and with West Virginia State University in Institute, West Virginia (just northwest of Charleston), to build a pipeline of skilled talent that is trained in software engineering, cloud operations, and support services related to Infor products. These universities are part of Infor’s Education Alliance Program (EAP), which provides member organizations access to free software used in business computing, as well as hands-on technical training. U.S. Senator Joe Manchin of West Virginia is pleased to have the software giant selecting the Mountain state to establish a regional office, bringing more than a hundred job opportunities to the state. The 12,000 sq/ft office anticipates bringing in 100 technical jobs to the Charleston area in software engineering, cloud operations, and consulting and support services to support its public sector customers. It is located on the 6th floor of the 18-story Laidley Tower building at 500 Lee Street East in downtown Charleston – one block away from the Charleston Transit Center and next to numerous downtown businesses.\n\nFor Full Article, Click Here"
