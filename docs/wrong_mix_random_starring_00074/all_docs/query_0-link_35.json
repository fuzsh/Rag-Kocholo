        "text": "Reduced Costs, Enhanced Visibility, Improved Safety and Fewer Rider Delays Among Core Benefits\n\nInfor, a leading provider of beautiful business applications specialized by industry and built for the cloud, today announced that the New York Metropolitan Transportation Authority (MTA) has selected Infor Enterprise Asset Management software (EAM), in conjunction with Bentley Systems, Incorporated, to standardize the management of assets throughout the organization.\n\nThe MTA operates the New York City subway and bus systems, and two commuter railroads which, on average, serve more than 8.6 million passengers in the City of New York and its metropolitan area, and nine toll bridges and tunnels within New York City.\n\nMTA sought a comprehensive, unified information technology approach for managing and maintaining each of the MTA operating agencies' infrastructure, vehicles, and other assets. Through the use of Infor's EAM by each of its agencies, the MTA expects to improve how its agencies manage and maintain their assets and that this will result in improved service and lower costs. In addition, EAM will enable the MTA to oversee those activities at the enterprise level.\n\nThe MTA's objective in making this EAM investment is to empower all levels of the MTA by providing more informed, transparent and data-driven decision-making. This will in turn help the organization optimize the use of resources and lower the cost of operations, while enhancing the safety and reliability of the infrastructure. Infor EAM will provide MTA users with analytical tools needed to handle all maintenance, strategic planning and reliability initiatives throughout the organization, which includes MTA Headquarters, MTA New York City Transit, MTA Bus, MTA Long Island Rail Road, MTA Metro-North Railroad, and MTA Bridges & Tunnels. By managing assets uniformly across the enterprise, the MTA can, through shared business practices, improve safety, reliability, cost-effective asset use and, most importantly, enhance customer satisfaction.\n\nTo facilitate the standardization of such an asset-rich organization, the MTA has created a Program Management Office (PMO) to help manage Enterprise Information, Asset Management and Strategic Innovation. The primary mission of the PMO is to develop a blue print for a long-term asset management strategy that can be implemented agency-wide to lower costs, improve inventory and deliver efficiency. By partnering with Infor EAM, the MTA anticipates improved reliability, greater transparency and an extended asset lifecycle through predictive maintenance. The implementation is also projected to improve safety and customer satisfaction for riders by creating a more resilient infrastructure that operates based on repeatable, industry best practices.\n\nThis contract is compliant with the Federal Transit Administration's (FTA) Disadvantaged Business Enterprise (DBE) regulation, which ensures a level playing field when awarding US Department of Transportation (USDOT) contracts to private organizations. The regulation also require DBE participation, i.e., firms that are at least 51 percent owned and controlled by individuals who are citizens or permanent residents of the United States and also meet the criteria of being socially and economically disadvantaged. The New York MTA Department of Diversity and Civil Rights had assigned a goal of 17 percent for the implementation of the contract, a goal that was met through the participation in this software procurement of Sygma Technology Solutions, a New York-based DBE IT consulting firm.\n\n\"The transportation industry represents a unique challenge when it comes to asset management. As timing is such a vital factor to the success of our objectives, we sought to enhance the asset management system that drives our organization. With Infor, we are able to structure an approach to improve asset reliability, reduce waste and achieve greater control of our diverse set of assets,\" said Feroze Khan, MTA procurement director of IT Category Management. \"Working with Infor will allow us to focus on managing the software needs of our organization in a manner which delivers the best possible experience to our riders.\"\n\nIn addition to Infor EAM, the New York MTA will also implement Infor ION, a purpose-built middleware system to help ensure a smooth transition from the MTA's legacy systems. Infor Dynamic Enterprise Performance Management (d/EPM) will also be utilized to deliver comprehensive analytics that create more informed decisions for the PMO by providing integrated compliance, budgeting, planning and KPI dashboards.\n\nThe MTA's initial deployment will start out with a limited Software-as-a-Service (SaaS) model that will provide the MTA with the ability to shift the MTA's immediate needs for EAM implementation from an on-premises to a cloud hosting model. By initially implementing the SaaS cloud model, the MTA can anticipate a reduction in capital IT expenditures through the elimination of hardware procurement and server maintenance for that implementation.\n\n\"The MTA is an exceptional example of how a public transportation organization can take proactive steps to ensure sustainable asset reliability. By choosing to standardize with Infor EAM, the MTA can expect to improve operations, inject greater transparency into fleet management, and lower costs by shifting to cloud-hosted deployment over time,\" said Kevin Curry, senior vice president, EAM & Public Sector, Infor. \"We look forward to delivering a best-in-class platform to an organization that drives the lives of so many citizens.\""
