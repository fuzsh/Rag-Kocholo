        "text": "The core team of five who started Infor, Inc. arrived at the office on the same day in December 2010. Now, five and a half years later, the company is seeing growth that increases exponentially every year.\n\nAccording to Stephan Scholl, president of Infor, much of this is because the company took a unique direction. While many of its competitors are focused on infrastructure, Infor decided to spend $2.8 billion on the application layer. By letting the infrastructure go and doubling down on the application layer, it has much more agility, Scholl explained. With the innovations developed through that investment, there’s no longer a need for modifications upgrade to new systems.\n\nScholl spoke to Dave Vellante (@dvellante) and George Gilbert (@ggilbert41), hosts of theCUBE, from the SiliconANGLE Media team, during Inforum 2016 at Javits Center in New York City.\n\nA key partnership with AWS\n\nAnother key reason for Infor’s success is its mutually beneficial partnership with Amazon Web Services, LLC (AWS). And it is proving itself to be different from its competitors with an open availability and by having the ability to take mission-critical applications to the cloud, said Scholl. And this partnership is what allows Infor to be able to provide this vital solution.\n\nCo-innovation and co-development are the hallmarks of its partnership with AWS, added Scholl. They work hand-in-hand on the ground floor, providing input into the framework. In return, AWS is aggressive in pursuit of these targets, with both sides contributing financially. “We’ve pushed them over the end, and they’re willing to follow our lead,” said Scholl. “It’s a true partnership.”\n\nGrowth in the coming years\n\nWith no one else able to function at the level that Infor and AWS can in this arena, according to Scholl, he is confident that Infor is miles ahead of its competitors. And he believes it’s likely the company can grow two to three times its size in the coming years.\n\nInfor looks forward to using this momentum and partnership to continue innovation, Scholl said.\n\nWatch the complete video interview below, and be sure to check out more of SiliconANGLE and theCUBE’s coverage of the Inforum 2016.\n\nPhoto by SiliconANGLE"
