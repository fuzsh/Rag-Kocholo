More than 1.5K public sector entities at all levels employ the platform.\n\nThe firm plans to team up with various West Virginia-based universities to develop talent in the company's areas of specialization under the Education Alliance Program,Â which grants free computing software for participants.\n\nÂ \"I thank Senators Joe Manchin and Shelly Moore Capito and many others who assisted Infor in establishing Charleston as a major cloud operations center,\" said Charles Phillips, Infor CEO."
