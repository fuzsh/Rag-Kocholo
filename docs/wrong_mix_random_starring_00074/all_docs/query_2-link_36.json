        "text": "WASHINGTON –The Howard University School of Business will kick-off the Executive Lecture Series for the 2019-2020 school year with a presentation by Charles Phillips, chairman of the Board of Directors for Infor. The lecture will be held Tuesday, Sept. 17 at 11:10 a.m. in the School of Business Auditorium, located at 2600 6th St NW.\n\n“The Executive Lecture Series is a program we are very proud of and one that we think provides a lot of value for our students and the Howard community,” says Barron H. Harvey, dean of the School of Business. “We are excited to welcome Charles Phillips to lecture to our students as he represents the kind of leadership that we want our students to be inspired by.”\n\nSince 1995, the Executive Lecture Series has served as a pinnacle program created by the School of Business to enhance the academic and professional development initiatives benefiting students, faculty, staff and other members of the University community. The Executive Lecture Series allows corporate executives and global leaders to observe Howard’s outstanding students and excellent programs while giving students exposure to leaders of various industries.\n\nBefore becoming chairman of Infor's Board of Directors, Phillips served as chief executive officer for nine years. As CEO, Phillips built the foundation for digital transformation: industry applications, domain experts, a science lab at M.I.T, machine learning, Internet of things, design thinking, and hyper-scale clouds to challenge business models and create new ones. Phillips pioneered the concept of deploying an entire industry in the cloud and, as a result, Infor now has more than 58 million cloud users.\n\nHeadquartered in New York City, Infor provides industry-specific software to more than 75,000 companies globally in the manufacturing, healthcare, fashion, government, and retail sectors, among others. Infor is a global leader in business cloud software specialized with 17,300 employees and over 68,000 customers in more than 170 countries.\n\nPrior to Infor, Phillips was president of Oracle Corporation and a member of its Board of Directors. During his seven and a half year-tenure, the company tripled in size and successfully acquired 70 companies. Phillips was also managing director in the Technology Group at Morgan Stanley and previously served as a captain in the U.S. Marine Corps in the 2nd Battalion, 10th Marines artillery unit. He serves on the boards of Viacom Corporation, the Apollo Theater, Business Executives for National Security, and the New York Police Foundation, as well as President Barack Obama’s Economic Recovery Board.\n\nPhillips holds a bachelor of science degree in computer science from the U.S. Air Force Academy, a juris doctorate from New York Law School, a master’s in business administration from Hampton University, and honorary doctorates from several universities. He is also a member of the Georgia State Bar.\n\nPhoto: Charles Phillips, source: FastCompany.com\n\n###\n\nAbout Infor\n\nInfor is a global leader in business cloud software specialized by industry.
