        "text": "Business application software provider Infor said it will relocate its headquarters from Alpharetta, Ga., to New York City by mid-2012. Infor CEO Charles Phillips said that 2011 has been a strong year for the company, with three consecutive quarters of double-digit year-over-year growth, which has fueled the decision to accelerate investment in product innovation by coming to New York’s “Silicon Alley.”\n\nInfor said its new site will be located a region of New York known for its high concentration of Internet and technology companies and access to the pool of technical talent in the area. The site will feature an innovation center, where it will house newly hired software engineers and graphic designers, and Infor said it expects to have one of the largest software engineering teams in New York.\n\nIn a statement, New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg said that the growth in the tech industry demands a large, dedicated workforce, which is behind the city’s Applied Sciences initiative to build a new engineering school.\n\nInfor said it expects to hire and house developers and graphic designers to enhance the user experience and integrate social applications into the workplace. Infor also plans to build a customer center that showcases its innovations.\n\nInfor’s current headquarters will continue to operate as its main shared services center, housing finance, human resources and tax services."
