        "text": "Mayor Goodwin and the Charleston Area Alliance welcome Infor, a global tech company, to the Capitol City. The company is opening an office in Charleston and bringing 100 new technology jobs to the Kanawha Valley. The City of Charleston and Charleston Area Alliance worked collaboratively with the West Virginia Development Office to help bring this new business to the community.\n\n“I am excited to welcome these new tech jobs to Downtown Charleston. This is in line with my focus to diversify our city’s job offerings, provide opportunities to create a more vibrant community and grow Charleston’s position within the technology sector,” Mayor Amy Shuler Goodwin said. “Infor will be hiring at the Kanawha Valley Job Fair co-hosted with U.S. Senator Joe Manchin’s office on March 22 at the Charleston Coliseum and Convention Center. N3 will also participate in the Job Fair and is looking to add 100 people to their workforce at that time.”\n\n“We’ve been incredibly excited about this project and the promise it holds. We’ve worked hand-in-hand with the city and the state to move it forward, and we applaud today’s announcement that these jobs are landing in Charleston,” said Matthew Ballard, the Alliance’s President and CEO. “With companies like Infor, N3 and Resolver making the strategic decision to locate here, our community is truly positioning itself as a new hub for the technology sector. We’re building a strong foundation of new technology jobs that will lead to future growth. That is something to celebrate.”"
