        "text": "NEW YORK, Feb. 7, 2019 /PRNewswire/ --Infor, a global leader in business cloud software specialized by industry, today announced that it has opened a new office in Charleston, West Virginia, to run cloud applications for U.S. Government Agencies (at the federal, state and local level). The office also will work closely with government contractors supporting these agencies.\n\nWith more than 17,000 employees, Infor offers purpose-built software applications for select industries, including the public sector. Over 1,500 state, local and federal entities run CloudSuite Public Sector.\n\nInfor anticipates that it will hire 100 technical employees in Charleston in the disciplines of software engineering, cloud operations, and consulting and support services to support its public sector customers. The office will expand as Infor adds additional customers.\n\n\"I am thrilled that Infor has chosen to locate a regional office in Charleston, bringing with it more than a hundred new, good-paying tech jobs to the state,\" said U.S. Senator Joe Manchin of West Virginia. \"I'm pleased to have had the opportunity to meet with Infor CEO Charles Phillips and his team on a number of occasions over the last year to discuss our skilled workforce and solidify the positive value of doing business in the Mountain State.\"\n\nInfor is partnering with Marshall University in Huntington, West Virginia, and with West Virginia State University in Institute, West Virginia (just northwest of Charleston), to build a pipeline of skilled talent that is trained in software engineering, cloud operations, and support services related to Infor products. These universities are part of Infor's Education Alliance Program (EAP), which provides member organizations access to free software used in business computing, as well as hands-on technical training.\n\n\"I am thrilled Infor has decided to open a new office in Charleston,\" said U.S. Senator Shelley Moore Capito of West Virginia. \"This announcement helps reaffirm our ability to compete for high-skilled jobs and attract investment from leading global firms, like Infor.\"\n\nInfor's Coleman Artificial Intelligence Platform is named after the inspiring physicist and mathematician Katherine Coleman Johnson, whose trail-blazing work at NASA helped U.S. astronauts land on the moon. Coleman graduated with highest honors from West Virginia State College (now West Virginia State University), earning bachelor's degrees in mathematics and French.\n\n\"I can't tell you how proud I am to welcome Infor to the Mountain State,\" said West Virginia Governor Jim Justice. \"I applaud their commitment to hiring West Virginians and to working with our local higher-education institutions to help keep more of our graduates right here at home. With the expansion of Infor, we can better attract other growing tech companies and show them why doing business in West Virginia is a great investment.\"\n\nInfor CEO Charles Phillips said, \"I thank Senators Joe Manchin and Shelly Moore Capito and many others who assisted Infor in establishing Charleston as a major cloud operations center. Infor has operations in over 200 countries and territories but selected the great state of West Virginia for this important initiative.\"\n\nThe new Infor 12,000-square-feet office is set up to support 100+ employees. It is located on the 6th floor of the 18-story Laidley Tower building at 500 Lee Street East in downtown Charleston â€“ one block away from the Charleston Transit Center and next to numerous downtown businesses.\n\nTweet This:\n\n@Infor opens new office in Charleston, #WestVirginia, to run #cloud applications for U.S. Government Agencies. http://bit.ly/2GpV1FC\n\nAbout Infor\n\nInfor is a global leader in business cloud software specialized by industry.
