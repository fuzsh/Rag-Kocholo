        "text": "Modernizing ERP Systems: Innovative Strategies With Infor\n\nWhat makes a modern, cloud-based ERP effective? Infor's success with systems tailored to specific industries provides a lens into the most important factors.\n\nInfor’s Strategy For Differentiation\n\nInfor has a truly differentiated approach to ensuring that their customers get ongoing value from the business applications they have purchased.\n\nInfor Nexus Is Taking An Interesting Approach To Generative AI\n\nChatGPT has generated a blizzard of publicity. But the use cases for generative AI in business software applications have been disappointing. Infor Nexus is an exception.\n\nInfor Enterprise Automation Puts Robotics Front-End Back-End\n\nInfor OS connects systems and people through back-end automation, decision automation and now – with the release of Infor RPA – front-end automation.\n\nTop Suppliers Of Transportation Execution And Visibility\n\nARC Advisory Group did a global market study of the Transportation Execution and Visibility market. The five largest providers of TES, listed alphabetically, are Descartes, E2open, FourKites, Infor Nexus, and project44.\n\nMolex Prizes Agility\n\nMolex, a global electronics and connectivity solutions company, has been investing in their intelligent digital supply chain strategy to improve their supply chain agility and customer experience. A solution from Infor Nexus at the heart of their digital supply chain infrastructure.\n\nTop Solutions for Supply Chain Agility\n\nWhile there are several types of solutions that contribute to supply chain agility, the KEY solution is a Multi-enterprise Supply Chain Network. The three leaders in this market are Descartes, E2open, and Infor Nexus.\n\nNavigating Turbulent Times With A Supply Chain Control Tower\n\nThere is a new generation of control towers, far more robust than what we have seen in the past. Covid-19 has served to highlight just how important supply chain agility is. The Infor Nexus solution has some distinctive capabilities.\n\nInfor CTO Defines Key Cornerstones Driving The Future Of Software\n\nSoftware industry visionaries are arguably more pragmatic that hardcore futurists, but no less prescient in their ability to be able to think about the next-big-thing and talk about likely platform-level shifts that will impact the way we use devices in the near future.\n\nInfor’s Cloud Race Brings $13 Billion Acquisition\n\nKoch Industries has closed on its reported $13 billion acquisition for the remaining shares of Infor. Under Charles Phillips’ leadership as chairman of Infor’s board of directors and previously CEO, the company charted its own path in the enterprise software marketplace.\n\nInfor CEO Kevin Samuelson: Why We’re Specifically Industry-Specific\n\nLeaner, meaner and keener is not the usual marketing spin that IT firms typically want to drive. But this scenario goes some way to explaining what’s happening at Infor, a company known for its industry-specific cloud applications prowess that gravitates towards ERP and supply chain tools.\n\nInfor Drives 'Operationalized AI' Forward With Coleman Platform\n\nAn AI algorithm is a set of instructions designed to solve a problem. It defines the relationships between different sets of data &amp; provides the computational steps to extract results. So an algorithm as a recipe, or a set of directions, but the data ingredients that go into it can change.\n\nInfor Aims To Build Tighter, Quieter, Brighter Digital Supply Chains\n\nMachines have the ability to help us digitally manage our businesses and drive forward AI-enabled supply chains that know more about themselves and so be able to orchestrate large portions of the business itself. The promise is tighter, quieter and brighter (more intelligent) commerce.\n\nInfor To Pay $8 Million Per Year For Brooklyn Nets Jersey Patch\n\nThe Brooklyn Nets have become the fourth NBA team to sign a jersey patch sponsorship deal, inking Infor to a 3-year deal at $8 million per year.\n\nA New Supply Chain Solution Is Prominently Featured At Infor's Inforum 2016 Conference\n\nAt the time of the acquisition it was estimated that GT Nexus had revenues of about $150 million, so the acquisition price was a substantial multiple of the GT Nexus’s revenues. So why did Infor pay so much for GT Nexus? In his keynote, CEO Charles Phillips made the point that “no one wants to be on a network until everyone is.”"
