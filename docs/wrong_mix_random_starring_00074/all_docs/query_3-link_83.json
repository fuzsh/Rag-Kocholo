        "text": "Today I will write a post on how to start with the Infor Smart Office SDK as a continuation of Karin’s getting started post and Scott’s one to eight part series. We use the Smart Office SDK to develop applications in C#/WPF that run inside Smart Office with the benefits of look & feel, session, user information, M3 context, integration to M3 APIs and M3 Web Services, etc. I’m developing an application for a customer to integrate Cisco IP phones with Infor Customer Lifecycle Management (CLM). This is a great opportunity for me to share with you interesting bits and pieces as I progress, and it’s a way for me to anchor what I learn. I will put screenshots galore.\n\nHere are the steps:\n\nDownload and install Microsoft Visual Studio for C# and WPF development. I opted for the free Visual Studio Express 2013 for Windows Desktop:\n\nLaunch it from the Windows Start menu > All Programs > Visual Studio 2013 > VS Express 2013 for Desktop:\n\nDownload and install the Infor Smart Office SDK from Infor Xtreme > Downloads > Products > User Productivity Platform > Smart Office SDK – M3; choose the same version as the target Smart Office server you will develop for, version 10.1 in my case:\n\nUnzip to a temporary folder in your computer and move the contents to the SDK root directory, for example C:\\InforSmartOfficeSDK\\ ; I moved to a folder with the full version number as I might have to switch back and forth between different versions for customer projects:\n\nFor more information , read the installation instructions in the Infor Smart Office Developers Guide at path Documentation\\DevelopersGuide.pdf:\n\nSet an environment variable LSOSDKBin in My Computer > Properties > Advanced system settings > Environment Variables, to the path of the Bin sub-folder, in my case it’s C:\\InforSmartOfficeSDK_10.1.1.1_20130920\\Bin :\n\nEdit the contents of the file RegisterServer.reg in a text editor like Notepad, and change the value of Server to point to the scheme://domain:port of your Smart Office server URL. Then execute the file to merge the new MangoDev Key into your Windows Registry (C:\\Windows\\regedit.exe); in my case I later manually added String values for Username and Password so I don’t get authentication prompts anymore (beware of this security risk):\n\nOpen the Sample Solution Samples\\Samples.sln in Visual Studio:\n\nSelect BUILD > Build Solution F7:\n\nSelect DEBUG > Start Debugging F5:\n\nThat will start Smart Office in Developer mode. Select Help (question mark icon at the top right) > About Infor Smart Office > View features, that will show you the Framework Examples and the Sample Feature:\n\nStart the Hello World application in the Sample menu of the Navigator widget:\n\nAnd try the other samples and widgets:\n\nThat’s it!\n\nIf you like this, subscribe to this blog to receive an email notification when we write posts, and become a contributor and write your M3 ideas.\n\nPublished by\n\nthibaudatwork\n\nex- M3 Technical Consultant View all posts by thibaudatwork"
