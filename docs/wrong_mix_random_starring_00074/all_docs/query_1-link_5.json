        "text": "Starting out with just a floor and a half in 2011, Infor has grown to occupy eight floors across 641/635 Sixth Avenue in just five short years. We worked with Infor throughout the conversion process—transforming what was once an emerging technology firm’s office into what is now their international headquarters.\n\nThe new space reflects the tech industry’s changing business drivers and new and expanding user groups. Workers and guests can enjoy a number of amenities including lounges, café/pantries, videos displayed on screens throughout the office, and breakout soft-seating clusters.\n\nOur team developed a workplace design aesthetic to mirror Infor’s brand and work culture. We aimed to promote transparency and collaboration within a technology-rich environment, which was achieved by incorporating three-dimensional layering of glass architectural elements, coupled with the open plan layout—ultimately promoting interconnectivity by allowing staff to see into multiple spaces simultaneously.\n\nThe palette of grey, white and Infor’s signature red, accented by wood finishes, colorful environmental graphics and rotating artwork installations makes for a visually-pleasing and high-energy work environment—perfect for their new headquarters."
