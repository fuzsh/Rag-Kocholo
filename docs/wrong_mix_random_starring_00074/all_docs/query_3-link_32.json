Is your enterprise ready? Many manufacturers are still burdened by highly customized, legacy on-premise ERP solutions. Extended over time with additional applications, the old systems often present a technical debt that makes it difficult to keep pace with business change. What’s needed is a proven, rapid path to ERP transformation, and Deloitte and Infor can help. Together, we bring the capabilities and cloud-based ERP solution that can serve as a platform to drive enterprise growth, increase market share, and deliver hard value for the bottom line.\n\nDeloitte and Infor for human capital\n\nThe workplace is changing fast, and to win the war for talent and prepare for the future of work, enterprises need to transform how they maximize the value in their greatest resource: their people. New priorities are emerging across industries—employee wellbeing, reskilling and upskilling human capital, and adapting for a future with AI and machine learning. Rising to the challenge, enterprises require better visibility into all aspects of their talent and people including access to diverse workforce segments (employees, contractors, gig workers), compliance with global and local regulations, support for employee growth, and tools that enable collaboration and improved decision-making. From HR and payroll to talent, workforce management (WFM) and learning management, Deloitte with Infor can deliver a Human Capital Management (HCM) solution that helps unleash, support, and retain your enterprise talent.\n\nDeloitte and Infor for healthcare organizations\n\nAttaining an ideal level of continuous innovation takes more than just technology—it requires a clearly defined path and closely managed organizational change. And that change needs to be coordinated among both your support and patient care staff, facilities, and many other stakeholders across the network.\n\nWhile this can be challenging, Deloitte can be the trusted resource that guides you through your journey and instills the resilience needed for constant improvement. As Infor’s leading global systems integrator (GSI), we draw on decades of experience and healthcare industry knowledge to help you confidently move away from the on-premise customizations that can sap productivity and hinder innovation.\n\nLearn more about how we can help you can achieve the digital transformation that equips your health care organization to meet challenges and opportunities, today and in the future.\n\nBack to top"
