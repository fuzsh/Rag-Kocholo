        "text": "New York City (NYC) is not Silicon Valley, but it’s one of the biggest tech hubs in the US. It was named Silicon Alley in the 1990s, having multiple tech companies operating in Manhattan.\n\nThe Silicon Alley name didn’t stick, but NYC proved to be a thriving and emerging IT hub with high ambitions. NYC is also referenced as “The Big Apple”, “The Melting Pot”, “The Capital of the World” and has multiple nicknames due to its massive diversity.\n\nAccording to the Office of the New York State Comptroller, there are more than 10,000 IT companies in NYC, which represents a growth of over 34% over the past couple of years, and software publishing is one of the fastest growing tech subsectors.\n\nIn 2022, there were 110 unicorns (companies valued at more than $1B) in NYC, based on the research presented by CB Insights. This makes New York the 2nd biggest city in the US by the number of unicorns & tech startups, just behind San Francisco with 167 unicorns.\n\nSome of the leading tech companies like IBM, Etsy, Vimeo, Squarespace, Shutterstock, Bloomberg, etc, are headquartered in NYC.\n\nVC (venture capital) firms invest heavily in NYC based tech startups. Venture funding in New York City boomed in recent years and reached tens of billions of investment to support IT companies from various industries like fintech, healthtech, security, AI, blockchain and more.\n\nThere are more than 1,260 IT companies from New York, registered on TechBehmoths.
