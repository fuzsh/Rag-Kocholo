We understand that the confluence of culture, art, and finance is a magnet for visitors from around the world. And working in Manhattan just steps from landmarks like the Empire State Building and Times Square, we feel the pulse of the city in our veins.\n\nFrom high-tech towers and wide avenues to gracious old buildings and narrow streets, the city’s mix of past, present, and future always brings out the best in us. Each day we come to work ready to tackle the creative, technically complex, never-seen-that-before challenges that our clients present and our urban fabric demands.\n\nInspired by and built on design excellence, our teams lead by example to create a more resilient and smarter city."
