The city invested $48 million to finance the construction for Frauenshuh, and another $22 million on an adjacent municipal parking ramp.\n\nFrauenshuh bought the building from the city in 2000 for $54.7 million and sold it in 2005 for an undisclosed amount to Behringer Harvard.\n\nThe city still owes $24 million on the bonds it took out to pay for the project, said Joe Campbell, St. Paul Mayor Chris Coleman’s communications director.\n\nCity leaders said it is common for companies to reexamine their options when their leases begin to come due, and such a move does not necessarily mean Infor will leave St. Paul proper or downtown.\n\n“This is a common practice in the marketplace … . It’s way too soon to sound the alarm bells,” Campbell said.\n\nBut the news that Infor may at the least shrink the amount of space it occupies in St. Paul comes on the heels of the recently announced closing in March of the downtown Macy’s department store.\n\n“It’s a challenge you never want to hear,” acknowledged Matt Kramer, president of the St. Paul Area Chamber of Commerce.\n\nKramer noted that Infor said it still has a commitment to the Twin Cities because of its strong employee base. The software company needs the former Lawson developers and staff to continue to improve and support the products its customers use.\n\nIt will be up to the city, the chamber and other parties to leverage downtown St. Paul’s strengths to keep those employees actively engaged with downtown, Kramer said.\n\nSome of the benefits of the Lawson Commons building location include access to the coming light-rail line, a bird’s–eye view of Rice Park and a short walk to the Ordway Theater or to the Xcel Center for a concert or NHL hockey, Kramer said.\n\nAnd the building has its own amenities. On one corner facing Rice Park and St. Peter Street is Kincaid’s, a classic steakhouse; a Chipotle Mexican Grill and a Starbucks can be accessed from the lobby. The block also includes a Dunn Bros. coffee shop and a nightclub, the Amsterdam Bar and Hall.\n\nKramer said he personally pitched Infor senior vice president Mary Trick, the software outfit’s operations leader in St. Paul, on the benefits of the reopened St. Paul Athletic Club, which Infor employees can reach through the skyway system.\n\n“There are a lot of benefits to being here, and our job is to sell those benefits,” he said.\n\n“The good news is we’ve got a little time. This is not something that needs to be hashed out in 30 days,” Kramer said.\n\nThe possible shrinkage of Infor’s office needs does not worry the mayor, Campbell said.\n\nCampbell ticked off a list of recent signs that downtown St. Paul remains a magnet for development. These included the news that the Mille Lacs Band of Ojibwe is interested in buying and operating the downtown Crowne Plaza and DoubleTree hotels, the development of a ballpark in Lowertown for the minor league St. Paul Saints, the completion of the light-rail Central Corridor line and the recently renovated Union Depot station.\n\n“The mayor very much believes our best days lay ahead of us,” Campbell said.\n\nLeslie Brooks Suzukamo can be reached at 651-228-5475.
