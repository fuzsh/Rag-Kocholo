Before we dive in, if you’re just starting your search for the best enterprise resource planning (ERP) tools, you should first check out my picks for thebest ERP software. Infor is one of the top-rated ERP tools out there, but to figure out if it's a good match for you, it's important to understand the software’s benefits and drawbacks.\n\nMy in-depth Infor review will take you through everything you need to know to make a more informed decision—pros and cons, features and functionality, pricing, and more—to help you to better understand its capabilities and suitability for your needs.\n\nInfor ERP Software Product Overview\n\nInfor is a comprehensive enterprise resource planning (ERP) software, often utilized by medium to large-sized businesses, including those in industries where software engineers focus on automation to enhance operational efficiency.

Its design supports the work of associate software engineers and DevOps teams, ensuring that current employees can efficiently address the needs of end users. It outperforms many competitors in industry specialization and global supply chain management but may fall short in terms of ease of customization and implementation complexity, a notable consideration for associate software engineers and DevOps professionals.\n\nWhile it offers excellent features, its cost and complexity make it less suitable for smaller businesses or those without significant IT resources. Infor is best for companies looking for a deep, industry-focused ERP system that can handle complex, global operations, aligning with the skill sets of associate software engineers and DevOps teams.\n\nInfor: The Bottom Line\n\nInfor distinguishes itself from similar ERP software with its industry-specific solutions and advanced analytics capabilities, particularly in the manufacturing industry.

The most disappointed customers are likely to be those from smaller operations or businesses that need a more straightforward, plug-and-play ERP solution. Environments with limited IT support, simpler operational needs, or tighter budget constraints may find Infor's expansive and detailed system more challenging and less cost-effective.\n\nInfor FAQs\n\nDoes Infor offer solutions for specific industries?\n\nYes, Infor provides industry-specific solutions for various sectors like manufacturing and healthcare.\n\nCan Infor integrate with existing business systems?\n\nYes, Infor offers integration capabilities with a wide range of business systems.\n\nIs Infor suitable for global supply chain management?\n\nYes, Infor excels in managing complex global supply chains.\n\nDoes Infor provide cloud-based ERP solutions?\n\nYes, Infor offers flexible cloud deployment options for its ERP solutions.\n\nCan Infor support multi-currency transactions?\n\nYes, Infor supports multi-currency transactions, catering to global businesses.\n\nIs mobile access available for Infor ERP?\n\nYes, Infor provides mobile accessibility for convenient management on the go.\n\nDoes Infor offer customizable ERP solutions?\n\nYes, Infor's ERP solutions can be customized to meet specific business needs.\n\nAlternatives to Infor\n\nSAP ERP: Ideal for large enterprises requiring robust and comprehensive ERP solutions.\n\nOracle NetSuite: Best suited for businesses looking for a cloud-native ERP with strong financial management capabilities.\n\nMicrosoft Dynamics 365: A good option for organizations that want seamless integration with other Microsoft products and services.\n\nInfor Company Overview & History\n\nInfor is a global enterprise software company providing a range of solutions, including ERP, supply chain management, asset management, and more.
