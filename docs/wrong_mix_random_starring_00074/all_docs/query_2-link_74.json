To receive a full credit for time remaining on your card, the envelope must be postmarked no later than one day after the problem occurs. Sundays and Federal holidays are not counted.\n\nMetroCard has expired\n\nWhether Pay-Per-Ride or Unlimited Ride, every MetroCard has an expiration date. The date is located at the upper left corner on the back of the card. The expiration date is usually about one year from the date of purchase.\n\nIf your Pay-Per-Ride MetroCard expires, you have two years from the expiration date to transfer any remaining money to a new card. Within the first year after expiration, use a MetroCard Vending Machine to transfer the balance to a new card. After that time, the expired MetroCard must be sent to MetroCard customer claims. Ask the station agent for a postage-paid Business Reply Envelope.\n\nMetroCard Customer Claims\n\n130 Livingston Street\n\nBrooklyn, NY 11201\n\nMetroCard was lost or stolen\n\nThe Pay-Per-Ride MetroCard can’t be replaced if it is lost or stolen. Treat it like cash. The following MetroCards can be replaced:\n\nEasyPayXpress and Reduced-Fare EasyPay MetroCard. Call the EasyPay Account Service Center at 1-877-323-7433 immediately if your card is lost or stolen. You can also file a claim online. We will deactivate your card to protect you from unauthorized charges. We will also send you a replacement card in the mail.\n\n30-Day Unlimited Ride MetroCard and the 7-Day Express Bus MetroCard. These cards provide balance protection if purchased with a credit card or debit/ATM card.\n\nReduced-Fare MetroCard. Call 511 and we will deactivate your MetroCard and send you a new one with the remaining fare value at the time of deactivation. Allow two/three weeks to receive your replacement card. You can also file a claim online.\n\nFor help, call 511 between 6 a.m. and 10 p.m., 7 days a week.\n\nHow to get a refund\n\nIf you used a MetroCard\n\nMost MetroCard claims can be filed online. If the issue you’re having is listed on this page, fill out and submit the related form. If not, you can print this form (or get one from a station agent) and mail it to us here:\n\nMetroCard Customer Claims\n\n130 Livingston Street\n\nBrooklyn, NY 11201\n\nIf you used an OMNY reader\n\nIf you believe that you were incorrectly charged by an OMNY reader, call us at 877-789-6669:\n\nMonday to Friday, 8 a.m. to 8 p.m.\n\nSaturday and Sunday, 8 a.m. to 5 p.m.\n\nAbout the Courtesy Pass\n\nOur goal every day is to give you the best service possible and, when something goes wrong, to fix the problem as quickly as we can. We do our best to get service moving again or to give you options to take another train or bus.\n\nIf a severe delay happens and this isn’t possible, you can ask a station agent for a Courtesy Pass. It’s not a refund, but you can use a Courtesy Pass as payment of fare on the subway or bus within 48 hours of when it was issued.\n\nYou ride because you have somewhere you need to go. Our pledge is to provide you with good service and, when service is not good, we strive to help you every step of the way.\n\nAbout GO Tickets\n\nDuring certain planned service changes, you might receive a GO Ticket from a station agent. This ticket allows you to continue your trip during the hours of scheduled maintenance or construction.\n\nThe “GO” in “GO Ticket” stands for “General Order,” which is what we call our plans for work and alternative service. And, of course, green also means go. We use both Courtesy Passes and GO Tickets to honor our pledge to keep you moving.\n\nHow to replace your MetroCard\n\nWe want to hear from you\n\nYou can sign up to join the community of customers who fill out our quarterly Customers Count survey. We'll send you an email each quarter to remind you to complete the survey. Each time you submit the form, we’ll enter your name into a drawing to win free rides. More importantly, you'll be giving us valuable feedback that we share with our team to make your commute better.\n\nThanks for riding with us."
