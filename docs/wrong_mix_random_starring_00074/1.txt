Infor is a privately held U.S. software company that specialises in enterprise software, ranging from financial systems and resource planning to supply chain and customer relationships. They recently moved their HQ from Georgia to New York City, and they did so with the help of VOA, a globally known architectural firm. The office is 48,000 sqft and emphasises collaborative working paradigms as much as practically possible.

The new collaborative layout brings a social essence to the floor, a core component of both Inforâ€™s product capabilities and the way team members develop ideas.
