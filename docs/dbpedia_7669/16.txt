Arnold Alois Schwarzenegger (born July 30, 1947) is an Austrian-American actor, producer, director, activist, businessman, investor, writer, philanthropist, former professional bodybuilder and politician who played Dutch in the 1987 film Predator. He later lent his voice and likeness to the character in the 2020 video game Predator: Hunting Grounds. Other notable films Schwarzenegger has appeared in include Pumping Iron (1977), Conan the Barbarian (1982), The Running Man (1987), Total Recall (1990), True Lies (1994), The 6th Day (2000) and The Expendables trilogy (2010-2014).

Schwarzenegger has won a Golden Globe and an Emmy. For his role in Predator, he was nominated for a Saturn Award for Best Actor. He is considered an icon of action cinema and starred in numerous big-budget Hollywood action films during the 1980s and 1990s. He has also had a political career; he served two terms as the 38th Governor of California from 2003 until 2011. Schwarzenegger was nicknamed the "Austrian Oak" in his bodybuilding days, "Arnie" during his acting career, and "The Governator" (a portmanteau of "Governor" and "The Terminator" – one of his best-known movie roles) since the start of his political career.

Trivia[]

The real-life goblin spider species Predatoroonops schwarzeneggeri is named after Schwarzenegger; every member of the Predatoroonops genus has a name that references Predator, due to the perceived similarity between the spider's mouthparts and the Predator's mandibles.[2] Additionally, one of the two recognised groups in the Predatoroonops genus is also named schwarzeneggeri.[2]

Schwarzenegger is unique in that he not only plays a character in one of the films from the Alien, Predator and Alien vs. Predator franchises, he is also mentioned by name in AVP media — specifically, he is said to be a blockbuster actor, as mentioned by Rasche in the novel Predator: Concrete Jungle.[3] Schwarzenegger also appears in a humorous cameo as himself in the novel Predator: Turnabout, during a brief sequence where Mary dreams that she is on the beach in Los Angeles and sees him walking by.
