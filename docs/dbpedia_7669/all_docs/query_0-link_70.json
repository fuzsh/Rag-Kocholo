Use the current page, even to continue an old discussion.\n\nI've created a script to copy and paste references within an item some months ago and after fixing all bugs that occured, I made it available as a gadget. You can enable DuplicateReferences in your preferences. The source code can be found here.\n\nA link will be placed next to every reference which allows you to copy that reference and insert it to another statement. This is very useful if one imports several statements from the same source and some users have been complaining about the waste of typing the same reference again and again. I hope this gadget helps you all adding more and more references to our statements.\n\nIssues and feature requests can be made on the talk page of the gadget or even better, directly on phabricator on our lovely Wikidata-Gadgets project.\n\nBest regards -- Bene* talk\n\nThx for this very useful tool. Is it possible to add a reference to the toolbar or to wikidata useful? Pyb (talk)\n\nHey Pyb, can you explain your idea a bit further? Do you want the gadget to remember a reference across items? -- Bene* talk\n\nI often use the same reference on a lot of items. Right now we couldn't quickly add a reference from Wikidata Useful or from the toolbar. It would be great if we could customize our javascript with our favorite references. A gadget to remember a reference across items would also be a good idea. Pyb (talk)\n\nCould some people help with cleaning up Wikidata:Database reports/Constraint violations/Mandatory constraints/Violations? The page has been around 60k bytes for quite some time now. Sjoerd de Bruin (talk)\n\nHoi, CEO only makes sense in relation to an organisation a person is CEO of. My question is, how do I add this on a person? Thanks, GerardM (talk)\n\nUse chief executive officer (P169) on the item that the person is CEO of. --Yair rand (talk)\n\nItem position held (P39) chief executive officer (Q484876). While you're at it, possibly also occupation (P106) businessperson (Q43845). --Izno (talk)\n\nThe current practice has ONLY CEO on people. CEO is by its very name related to a company. Businessman is not. Thanks, GerardM (talk)\n\nUse <position held (P39) chief executive officer (Q484876)> with qualifier (of (P642):'company item'). P642 is widely used as a qualifier to P39. Joe Filceolaire (talk)\n\n@Filceolaire, Izno, GerardM, Yair rand: Eh guys, please add this usecase to WikiProject Reasoning. It seems especially suitable to handle these representation mismatch of the same things.\n\nUse <employer (P108): 'company item'> with qualifier <position held (P39): chief executive officer (Q484876)>. @Filceolaire: of (P642) can be widely used, but it would be better to keep it as a last option, specially if other (much more precise) alternatives are available. Andreasm háblame / just talk to me\n\n+1. Yeah that is better. Joe Filceolaire (talk)\n\nP39 is meant to be a first class statement given that it has required qualifiers (though I appreciate the use). --Izno (talk)\n\nI don't like that we don't have a policy about biographies of living persons here. See for example Della Rose Joel (Q20888791). Describing very young childeren of people who are still alive... I don't think that is a good idea. Sjoerd de Bruin (talk)\n\nWe already have Princess Charlotte of Wales (Q18002970), so why not. But statements should be sourced.--GZWDer (talk)\n\nPractically it is \"Kian\" who can do the best job by harvesting information continuously from Wikipedias. It is a matter of training the statements that are of a particular concern. As it is, many items for people are insufficient. BLP is quality and it is imho best when we concentrate on specific attributes one at a time and improve quality in this way.\n\nConsequently as we get better in BLP related information, we will be able to signal BLP issues to Wikipedias. Thanks, GerardM (talk)\n\nThere is more than one aspect to BLP but the most fundamental aspects is that we avoid libelling (or is it slandering) living persons because they can sue. We don't want <instance of:war criminal> or <occupation:thief> or similar added to an item about a living person without solid references to an actual conviction in court. I guess this is what we should be training bots to look out for.\n\nAs well as statements there is also the possibility of libel in Descriptions; especially as we have hundreds of different Descriptions in different languages. This will, I think, be much harder for bots to detect - another argument for automatically generating Descriptions from statements instead. Joe Filceolaire (talk)\n\nAs it is there is no way for us to have something functional without tools like Kian. Quality is quality and BLP is nothing different. When a Wikipedia makes a BLP booboo, we will capture those booboos in Wikidata. Having solid tools like Kian, we can be the best because we capture changes in Wikipedias as well. The notion that Wikidata will have sources for everything that may be problematic in BLP is not really realistic. What we need is being responsive to quality issues notified to us by tools. That will for a long time be the best we can do. Thanks, GerardM (talk)\n\nHello, As you may know I'm building AI tools to fight vandalism and triage edits for human review. I want to know what kind of vandalism is common in Wikidata, what kind of items are common targets and things like that. Specially some examples can help me a lot. Your input is valuable to me, and if you don't want to share your ideas publicly (in case you might be thinking that vandals will see) please feel free to send me an email (ladsgroup at gmail). There is a paper published in this case and we can discuss about that too :) Best Amir (talk)\n\nYou can start with looking into the abuse filters (Special:Tags could also be relevant). Matěj Suchánek (talk)\n\nDo you have any code up to look at so far? :) / where would it be? :) ·addshore· talk to me!\n\nPasleim's PLbot collects possible vandalism at User:Pasleim/Vandalism, Ivan A. Krestnin's KrBot collects removed sitelinks at User:KrBot/Lost links, Emaus' LinkRecoveryBot used to revert these removals but sometimes had false positives. Matěj Suchánek (talk)\n\nThank you. I will look into them and I probably ask some questions here. @Addshore: the source code is here it's based on revision scoring (m:ORES), the most important part is building features for the AI system and then it will train and builds the classifier. If you need help in running the code, tell :) Thanks Amir (talk)\n\nSee analysis and studies summarized at Help_talk:Description#Vandalism_problem. --Atlasowa (talk)\n\nHi all,\n\nWe are excited to introduce a new Wikimedia Public Policy site. The site includes resources and position statements on access, copyright, censorship, intermediary liability, and privacy. The site explains how good public policy supports the Wikimedia projects, editors, and mission.\n\nVisit the public policy portal: https://policy.wikimedia.org/\n\nPlease help translate the statements on Meta Wiki. You can read more on the Wikimedia blog.\n\nThanks,\n\nYana and Stephen (Talk)\n\n(Sent with the Global message delivery system)\n\nHi everyone :)\n\nWe've finally done all the groundwork for unit support. I'd love for you to give the first version a try on the test system here: http://wikidata.beta.wmflabs.org/wiki/Q23950\n\nThere are a few known issues still but since this is one of the things holding back Wikidata I made the call to release now and work on these remaining things after that. What I know is still missing:\n\nWe're showing the label of the item of the unit. We should be showing the symbol of the unit in the future. (https://phabricator.wikimedia.org/T77983)\n\nWe can't convert between units yet - we only have the groundwork for it so far. (https://phabricator.wikimedia.org/T77978)\n\nThe items representing often-used units should be ranked higher in the selector. (https://phabricator.wikimedia.org/T110673)\n\nWhen editing an existing value you see the URL of unit's item. This should be replaced by the label. (https://phabricator.wikimedia.org/T110675)\n\nWhen viewing a diff of a unit change you see the URL of the unit's item. This should be replaced by the label. (https://phabricator.wikimedia.org/T108808)\n\nWe need to think some more about the automatic edit summaries for unit-related changes. (https://phabricator.wikimedia.org/T108807)\n\nIf you find any bugs or if you are missing other absolutely critical things please let me know here or file a ticket on phabricator.wikimedia.org. If everything goes well we can get this on Wikidata next Wednesday.\n\nCheers --Lydia Pintscher (WMDE) (talk)\n\nYay! Looking forward to playing with this :) —Galaktos (talk)\n\nThe link in the unit selection menu goes to /entity/Q1234 instead of /wiki/Q1234; is that a bug or just a configuration problem of the beta instance? —Galaktos (talk)\n\nThat's intended as that is the URI of the concept and that is semantically correct there. --Lydia Pintscher (WMDE) (talk)\n\nReally? ’Cause following the link gives me a 404 error :D —Galaktos (talk)\n\nOhhhh ok. Yeah that redirecting is probably not set up for beta. It works on Wikidata itself. Thanks for checking! --Lydia Pintscher (WMDE) (talk)\n\nOh I see, over here /entity links work. Thanks! —Galaktos (talk)\n\nDoes not recognize aliases for units. \"Meter\" must be spelled in the American style; \"metre\" doesn't work.\n\nJust add it as an alias to the item and it'll work :) --Lydia Pintscher (WMDE) (talk)\n\nNo ability to enter an exact quantity. To enter an exact quantity one must enter, for example, 299792458±0, which the average user is unlikely to guess.\n\nYes that's the same way as it has been with quantities before. We need to work on that as well but it is unrelated to unit support. --Lydia Pintscher (WMDE) (talk)\n\nThis is tracked at https://phabricator.wikimedia.org/T68580 btw. —Galaktos (talk)\n\nIs there a list of allowed units somewhere? Or can any entity on wikidata be a unit? Should there maybe be a class (\"unit\" - standard of measurement) with units instances of that or of subclasses? Also, will the rollout include creating all the properties listed on Wikidata:Property_proposal/Pending/2? ArthurPSmith (talk)\n\nYes any item on Wikidata can be used as a unit. There should later probably be constraints checks to find items that use items that likely should not be a unit. Once the code is rolled out the people with property creator rights can create the properties that have been waiting for unit support. That is however not a thing the dev team will do. I don't expect it to take long for that to get done. --Lydia Pintscher (WMDE) (talk)\n\nok, I guess that's fine. I didn't find it before but we do have unit of measurement that every unit should be an instance of (directly or indirectly) so doing the constraint check should be relatively straightforward. Probably needs some experience in use though. ArthurPSmith (talk)\n\n→ Wikidata:Property_proposal/Generic#conversion_to_standard_unit --- Jura\n\nIf units have to be entities, it would sometimes be necessary to create an entity just to support a particular quantity, such as the gravitational constant 6·67428 × 10⁻¹¹ m³ kg⁻¹ s⁻². Giving that unit a label and finding it may be a challenge. Jc3s5h (talk)\n\ncan you think of a good alternative? Allowing the unit to be a combination of entities in some way perhaps? That seems overly complicated for most situations though. ArthurPSmith (talk)\n\naliases : there is aliases to help the search :) the gravitational constant unit can very well be aliased (or even labeled) \"gravitational constant unit\". author TomT0m / talk page\n\nThe unit(s) (m³ kg⁻¹ s⁻²) is not the value of the constant (6·67428 × 10⁻¹¹ m³ kg⁻¹ s⁻²). How do you, on the page of the gravitational constant, describe its value? --Izno (talk)\n\ndimensional analysis\n\n@Izno: its a different question, retrieving easily an item and describing it. Any item can be a unit. Considering this specific unit is expressed wrt. other more elemental unit, we have to find a way to express (m³ kg⁻¹ s⁻²) in Wikidata. We already have items for \"m\", \"kg\" and \"s\", we could create item for m³, kg⁻¹, and s⁻² which mean we will have to introduce a property to express the power of units. We have to introduce a (n-ary) property to express multiplication of units, something like\n\n⟨ m³ kg⁻¹ s⁻² ⟩ multiplication of units Search ⟨ m³ ⟩\n\ntogether with (P1706) ⟨ kg⁻¹ ⟩\n\ns⁻² Search ⟨ {{{7}}} ⟩\n\n. For the power items, we would have\n\n⟨ m³ ⟩ unit power of Search ⟨ m ⟩\n\npower value Search ⟨ 3 ⟩\n\n. For example. author TomT0m / talk page\n\nI would expect clicking \"X\" on the unit box to remove the unit. (That is, change it from \"1 meter\" to \"1\".) Instead, it only hides the box. --Yair rand (talk)\n\nHmm yeah that is a tricky one with this user interface. I actually forgot to add this to the list of known issues. It'll have to be split into two proper input fields instead of this overlay. This is just the quickest we could technically do. Once we have two proper input fields the issue you are having should be solved. We have phabricator:T109459 for that. --Lydia Pintscher (WMDE) (talk)\n\nImpossible to enter °F and °C by their aliases. When I use the Q number instead, the label shown is incomprehensible (\"GUbpRaNn\" and \"zCBkZFkr\"). --Casper Tinan (talk)\n\nI just tried it on the test system and it worked fine. I had to create the item for °C first though. --Lydia Pintscher (WMDE) (talk)\n\nExcelent. Thanks a lot. It might be possible to limit the suggested unit values to (1) often used units or (2) subject of the property (P1629) and from here measured by (P1880, reverse of measured physical quantity P111). Poul G (talk)\n\n@Lydia Pintscher (WMDE): So, Wednesday's come and gone, and units wasn't deployed. Did something go wrong? Is there a new schedule? --Yair rand (talk)\n\nSorry I realize now that my wording was ambiguous. I meant Wednesday September 9th. Sorry for the confusion. --Lydia Pintscher (WMDE) (talk)\n\nHey folks :)\n\nAs part of his internship with us Bene has been working on making Wikidata more usable on mobile devices. We'll be redirecting users on mobile devices there soon just like it is done on Wikipedia.

Redirecting people on mobile devices isn't happening yet. --Lydia Pintscher (WMDE) (talk)\n\nPlease see the announcement at Wikidata talk:Flow#Priorities for the Collaboration (Flow) team. --- Jura\n\nThis is extremely disappointing and a slap in the face of everyone who invested time in getting this enabled. The code is just going to rot, we should stop all conversions immediately and revert all pages that already have been changed. Deploying an unfinished product for which the support will crumble over the next couple of months will just be a source of more WMF frustration. And this is coming from someone who was starting to like it. Multichill (talk)\n\nI'm ready to start rewriting Wikidata:Glossary as my comment on the talk page but the translation tags are messing editing up. I am going to copy it to User:Filceolaire/Draft:Glossary, strip out all the translation tags, rearrange and rewrite then copy it back over Wikidata:Glossary and call for retranslation and tagging - unless anyone has a better idea? Joe Filceolaire (talk)\n\nDone. Well ready for review. I have completely rewritten the Glossary at User:Filceolaire/Draft:Glossary and kept less than 10% of the old definitions. Anyone who wants to comment please do before I overwrite the existing. Joe Filceolaire (talk)\n\nSure. But don't think for a second that it is remotely ok to paste all of that into Wikidata:Glossary without the translation tags.--Snaevar (talk)\n\nThanks Snaevar for adding tags. I've incorporated all the comments and this has added a few sections since then I'm afraid and I am not familiar with Translation tags to fix it. I would like to get it finished so I can overwrite the existing page. Can you help or suggest where I can find out how to fix this myself? Joe Filceolaire (talk)\n\nIs Q1627243 and Q209896 the same? If yes: please merge into one object. --2A02:810D:27C0:5CC:5C05:B3B8:B224:E4D5\n\nDone by Vlsergey apparently. —Galaktos (talk)\n\nI'm finding that on pages such as: Wikidata:Database reports/Constraint violations/Mandatory constraints/Violations, some entries are displayed in a script I don't recognise, possibly Cyrillic. For example: Q501 is displayed as Шарль Бодлер (Q501), but if I go onto the item, Charles Baudelaire is displayed at the top, as that is the label in English. Is there a way to stop this? I have the language set to English in my settings, but is there some setting I'm missing? Silverfish (talk)\n\nAdd babel boxes to your user page. See my page for example. Languages are based on your current location without them. Sjoerd de Bruin (talk)\n\nI've added a babel box, and now nothing displays the name, just the Q identifier. And after a little while I've gone back to the same page, and it's the same as before. Note it's only on pages like that that this happens, on the Autolist 2 tool it just displays the English label, for example, and that seems to the usual way things work. And on that page only some of the items have that sort of link with the text in Cyrillic, some have the text in English, and some just the Q identifier (those within an English label, I assume). Silverfish (talk)\n\nThis seems to be a very strange issue. On special pages we automatically add the label when an item is linked but in Wikitext that shouldn't happen. Apparently, something like that happens nevertheless. After purging the page, the labels are gone. You see the labels in Russian because the HTML gets cached after saving in the language the last editor of the page has set in their preferences. -- Bene* talk\n\nCheck which namespaces/pages are actually cached. Jeblad (talk)\n\nI was editing Labette Cardinals (Q17015538) - a bunch of sports teams attached to a college in Kansas - and I came across this problem:\n\nWe have sport (P641) to indicate what sport a team or individual plays but most competitions are restricted in other ways. You don't compete in tennis or even in tennis doubles (Q18123885) - you compete in Womens professional tennis doubles. What properties should we use to indicate these restrictions? Joe Filceolaire (talk)\n\n@Filceolaire: It's a sports league (Q623109) (league (P118). I always wondered if a sport was actually assimilated with the rules you follow on a match for example, which would mean basketball = basketball match for example. author TomT0m / talk page\n\nYes TomT0m, Labette Cardinals (Q17015538) is in the Kansas Jayhawk Community College Conference (Q16998117) league but they compete in 6 different sports, some men only, some women only, some both sexes. I think the 'Spirit squad' may even be mixed., I accept that we should create a separate item for each thing the Olympics give medals for but do we need to do the same for Kansas Jayhawk Community College Conference (Q16998117) or can we use qualifiers?\n\nHow do we say\n\nif it is men/women/mixed;\n\nif it is amateur or professional;\n\nif it is local, regional, national or international;\n\nif it is under 12s, under 18s, under 21s, veterans;\n\nif it is one of those categories the paralympics have;\n\nif it is 100m, 200m, 400m, 800m?\n\nIs there an existing property/qualifier we could use? Do we need a new property? Do we need a new property for each of these? Joe Filceolaire (talk)\n\nTo me 800m is a sport by itself, who is a part of the more general athletics (Q542) one, for example: usually there is a 800m competition in a meeting. author TomT0m / talk page\n\nplease look at Lee (Q218125) and LEE (Q6457631). i noticed that at the moment it is (partly) impossible to add/change labels/descriptions of items which differ only in lower/upper case spelling. This was possible in the past.\n\nfor example please try out at Lee (Q218125) to change en-description \"Wikipedia disambiguation page\" to \"Wikimedia disambiguation page\". Then an error note appears telling that LEE (Q6457631) already has the same description (even if its label is spelled differently).\n\ndoes someone know more about this, or can help? Holger1959 (talk)\n\nIt's a feature of the software that no two items can have the same Label and Description in one language. \"Wikimedia disambiguation page (but see 'LEE' also)\" and \"Wikimedia disambiguation page (but see also 'Lee')\" should work. Joe Filceolaire (talk)\n\nJust curious if such \"feature\" could be disabled. It much simple to enter nothing into description at all than duplicating description. -- Vlsergey (talk)\n\n@Filceolaire: thank you for reply! do you know who decided this and where the change was announced?\n\nProblem: we have thousands (!) of different items like Abcd and ABCD, mainly because enwiki (but also some other Wikipedias) has different pages in many such cases (often disambiguations, but there are also \"CamelCase\" items vs. not \"Camelcase\" items, etc).\n\nI mean, it would be easy for me to add \"(but see also …)\" to the English label, and \"(aber siehe auch …)\" to the German label, but what should i add for all the other possible languages if every label in every language must differ? this really looks like a bad change to me. Holger1959 (talk)\n\nHolger: The developers put this feature into the code but you will have to ask Lydia Pintscher (WMDE) where (or if) that was announced (she leads the developers team). The problem mainly relates to Disambiguation pages - other types of page are unlikely to have the same description for both pages. If Lydia doesn't get back to you here you can ask on Wikidata:Contact_the_development_team or you can also register a bug/feature request on [1]. Hope that helps. Joe Filceolaire (talk)\n\n@Lydia Pintscher (WMDE): can you say something about this issue? to see the \"API Error\" problem, please try eg. changing the Dutch/nl description of Lee (Q218125) to the standard string \"Wikimedia-doorverwijspagina\", or try changing the English/en description to \"Wikimedia disambiguation page\". Another example could be the 2 items for UOC (UOC (Q6478014)) und UoC (UoC (Q7897866)).\n\nFor editing such items after the software change, we have to either change their labels in all languages (eg. for English from \"LEE\" to \"LEE (all capitals)\", or for German to \"LEE (in Großbuchstaben)\", etc), or we have to change their descriptions in all languages (see Filceolaire's suggestion above). For both options i don't know what to add eg. in Spanish, or in many other languages i don't speak. For the \"change labels option\", this would also break the rule that labels generally should only contain the term itself (no additional strings). For the \"change descriptions option\", this would break the rule for disambiguations, that they should be uniform (all the same, not differing, at least in Latin Script languages), and this would also break the standardized set of disambiguation descriptions used by many bots, tools and users. Holger1959 (talk)\n\nThe label plus the description should be unique and identify an entity clearly. Difference only in case is not enough. We should give more information imho. --Lydia Pintscher (WMDE) (talk)\n\n@Lydia Pintscher (WMDE): what do you mean with \"We should give more information\" – who is \"we\"? the developers (on how to handle such problems), or the community (on which information)?\n\ni would be happy if you (or someone else) could tell or show me a working solution for the problem. i don't know the exact number, but i think enwiki alone has more than 1000 such \"double\" disambiguations where we at Wikidata have two items like \"Lee/LEE\" or \"UoC/UOC\".\n\nof course one could also say \"only one of them is allowed\", but i don't know if we could really force enwiki (and other projects) to merge all these pages? Holger1959 (talk)\n\nHow could we help users to find properties that are relevant to specific infoboxes? Ideally a project would list them, but I think we don't have that many projects for that to be possible. --- Jura\n\n@Jura1: Assuming an infobox is mapped to a class, or some subclasses of a class, templates like {{PropertyForThisType}} and more importantly the corresponding property should help. author TomT0m / talk page\n\nYes, properties for this type (P1963) on the item mentioned in template has topic (P1423) should do. Thanks. --- Jura\n\nA dynamic approach might be to run related_properties.php on items with instance of (P31) = the item mentioned in template has topic (P1423). --- Jura\n\nGreetings!

Does anyone know if there are optimisations possible or needed to enable tree query intersections on the Wikidata Query Service beta (ie the SPARQL beta) ?\n\nThe query I'm trying to run is to try to discover why The Guardian (Q11148) was being returned as a member of the class-tree of occurrence (Q1190554) in . So I'm trying to query to return all the items in that class-tree, between The Guardian (Q11148) and occurrence (Q1190554).\n\nFirst I tried to use WDQ, with ; but it only returns the single item The Guardian (Q11148) itself.\n\nHaving tried another similar WDQ query, to discover items in the corresponding class-tree for Hundred Years' War (Q12551), it seems WDQ may be returning only partial response-sets on queries like this, apparently when it reaches an item in the tree with more than one parent (details in this ping to Magnus.)\n\nSo I thought I'd try the SPARQL beta instead. After a couple of hours trying to get to grips with how to do SPARQL, I think this is a corresponding SPARQL query, at least in a basic form, [2] (seemingly having clicked the link you may then need to hit return by hand in the browser bar to load the query; then hit the 'execute' button below) -- but the query is timing out, presumably when it tries to create a full descending class-tree for occurrence (Q1190554).\n\nCan anyone check whether my SPARQL is right, and/or suggest any optimisation that may help -- eg perhaps to hint to it to try to run the upward query from The Guardian (Q11148) first, and then an upward query from each of the items in that set, rather than a full descending query from occurrence (Q1190554) ? Alternatively, does anyone know what @Magnus Manske: did to get queries like this to work, and whether any similar heuristics could or are being planned for the SPARQL version ?\n\nI appreciate that I'm a SPARQL newbie, so my query may be wrong. But this seem (at least at my newbie level of understanding) a reasonably straightforward example of the sort of query that we would seek to be able to run successfully and routinely.\n\nThanks in advance for any help anyone can offer. All best, Jheald (talk)\n\nMaybe it's because The Guardian (Q11148) is instance of newspaper (Q11032) which is subclass of publication (Q732577) which is instance of process (Q10843872) which is subclass of process (Q3249551) which is subclass of occurrence (Q1190554)? Mushroom (talk)\n\n@Mushroom: Thanks!! I'd missed the \"instance of process (Q10843872)\" when I was trying to follow the chain by hand. (Which may imply I'm going to need something more sophisticated than just TREE in the original WDQ query, eg perhaps ).\n\nOn the other hand, I still don't see why my subsequent WDQ and SPARQL queries didn't work to try to find the items in the chain -- looking at some of the Autolist results from the queries at Wikidata:WikiProject_UK_and_Ireland#Stats, there's a lot more than just The Guardian (Q11148) which seems anomalous, so anything to make the investigation process less manual is valuable. Jheald (talk)\n\n@Mushroom, Jheald: This chain subclass/instance seems bogus. I usually insist that for something like this to work correctly, in the spirit of Help:Classification, we need to take care that a class as class as real world of object should always be a subclass of real world object classes, and that class of class of real world object should always be subclasses of class of class of real world object ... events or processes subclasses of events or process classes and so on. Can we stop a bit here and think about this in this particular case ? author TomT0m / talk page\n\n@TomT0m, Mushroom: I have had a bit more of a think here about the statement that seems to have caused this.\n\nThe problematic statement appears to be\n\npublication (Q732577) ... is an instance of (P31) ... process (Q10843872)\n\nwhereas what I think may have been intended might have been something a bit more like\n\nscientific style (Q7433830) ... is part of (P361) ... engineering (Q11023)\n\nMaking this change would leave publication (Q732577) entirely focussed on the notion of representing a publication, a physical object; rather than the process of publication, the (or an) act of publishing. This would solve the class-tree issue -- though I am a little worried that the classification might not be reflecting the actual full content and scope of the directly sitelinked articles.\n\nI would suggest further discussion specifically on the classification of publication (Q732577) could be appropriately located at Wikidata:Classification_noticeboard#Publication, and leave this thread here for any discussion / hints / tips as to how to get best results for SPARQL queries. Best, Jheald (talk)\n\nHoi, Statistics on Wikidata seems to be in dire straits when I notice no updates for august.. What is going on, what can be done to improve things? Thanks, GerardM (talk)\n\nHi everyone,\n\nAs Wikidatans, we all know how much data quality matters.\n\nWe all know what high quality stands for: statements need to be validated via references to external, non-wiki, trustworthy sources.\n\nThat's why the primary sources tool is being developed.\n\nAnd that's why I am preparing the StrepHit IEG proposal.\n\nStrepHit (pronounced \"strep hit\", means \"Statement? repherence it!\") is a Natural Language Processing pipeline that understands human language, extracts structured data from raw text and produces Wikidata statements with reference URLs.\n\nAs a demonstration to support the IEG proposal, you can find the FBK-strephit-soccer dataset uploaded to the primary sources tool backend. It's a small dataset serving the soccer domain use case.\n\nPlease follow the instructions on the project page to activate it and start playing with the data.\n\nWhat is the biggest difference that sets StrepHit datasets apart from the currently uploaded ones?\n\nAt least one reference URL is always guaranteed for each statement.\n\nThis means that if StrepHit finds some new statement that was not there in Wikidata before, it will always propose its external references.\n\nWe do not want to manually reject all the new statements with no reference, right?\n\nIf you like the idea, please endorse the StrepHit IEG proposal!\n\nCheers,\n\n--Hjfocs (talk)\n\nThe danger of blanket statements is that they are often easy to refute. No. Quality is not determined by sources. Sources do lie.\n\nWhen you want quality, you seek sources where they matter most. It is not by going for \"all\" of them, it is where Wikidata differs from other sources.\n\nArguably and I do make that argument. Wikidata is so much underdeveloped in the statement department that having more data with a reasonable expectation of quality will trump quality for a much smaller dataset.\n\nI do not understand at all why your tool must feed into the primary sources tool. Imho it is anathema to the instant gratification that is posting in Wikidata itself.\n\n\"Rejecting new statements with no reference\"? That is plain insane. It is just another argument why I hate the presentation of your idea.\n\nThanks, GerardM (talk)\n\nThanks GerardM for your criticism, let me reply to your concerns.\n\n\"Quality is not determined by sources. Sources do lie. When you want quality, you seek sources where they matter most.\"\n\n\"Rejecting new statements with no reference\"? That is plain insane.\"\n\nThe following references contrast the above points. I got inspired by them when developing the idea:\n\nWikidata:Referencing_improvements_input\n\nhttp://blog.wikimedia.de/2015/01/03/scaling-wikidata-success-means-making-the-pie-bigger/\n\nhttps://tools.wmflabs.org/wikidata-todo/sourcery.html\n\nhttps://phabricator.wikimedia.org/T76230\n\nhttps://phabricator.wikimedia.org/T76232\n\nhttps://phabricator.wikimedia.org/T76231\n\nhttps://phabricator.wikimedia.org/T90881\n\n\"It is not by going for \"all\" of them\"\n\nI completely agree with you that many sources can be flawed. I may have neglected the term \"trustworthy\" before \"sources\" and added it.\n\nThe project will also include an investigation phase to select a set of authoritative sources, see the first task in the proposal work package.\n\n\"I do not understand at all why your tool must feed into the primary sources tool.\"\n\nAs stated in the project page, the primary sources tool is made for data donations, and StrepHit would consist exactly of that.\n\nCheers,\n\n--Hjfocs (talk)\n\nPhabricator is very much a development environment. What goes on there is not familiar to many people like myself that are deeply involved in Wikidata. Certainly not when suggestions like compulsory references to statements are made. The sad thing is that the tool that you may be working on becomes in this way an aggressive statement, not into a welcome plan for a tool that may integrate with existing tools. Integration is what we need. Both quality and quantity is what we need badly.\n\nIn my blogpost I suggest that StrepHit will be awesome when it is more like Kian. It actively seeks integration both by playing nice with other tools and by seeking cooperation and not confrontation. There is plenty of room for StrepHit, it is a choice of its creators what it is they want it to be. Thanks, GerardM (talk)\n\n\"The sad thing is that the tool that you may be working on becomes in this way an aggressive statement\"\n\nThe primary sources tool actually asks the user to approve or reject new references for an existing statement or new statements extracted from external sources (which always come with references in the StrepHit case).\n\nUnder this perspective, I think it is way less aggressive than directly adding statements into the knowledge base.\n\nCheers,\n\n--Hjfocs (talk)\n\nAfter the suggestion was made at the London science meet-up yesterday, I have been bold and created a new Wikidata:Classification noticeboard, in similar spirit to the existing Wikidata:Interwiki conflicts page for sitelink issues. On the new page I hope people will feel encouraged to bring apparent issues in the classification tree for discussion -- for example, instance of (P31) / subclass of (P279) chains that appear to lead to paradoxical results or nonsense search results; discussions about best choices of classification statements for particular items; and any other specific class-tree examples that just smell wrong.\n\nIt seemed to me that it would be useful to have a dedicated page that such issues could be brought to without swamping Project Chat. I know it's an area that myself I don't feel 100% confident in, so felt it would be good to have somewhere to bring things that don't smell quite right, for feedback and review if I think I can see how things might be fixed, or to be able to involve experts if I can't. There is certainly a lot that doesn't seem quite right at the moment -- the Autolist searches at Wikidata:WikiProject_UK_and_Ireland#Stats currently bring up a lot of anomalous results, which I hope to work through somewhat as a project over the next few months. But with luck many such of these anomalies will turn out to be related, so that starting to look at a few, and resolving issues in the tree of classes that cause those, may then make many of the other anomalies go away as results of the same cause. My hope is that with a dedicated page, it will act as a magnet for people to bring forward such anomalies, leading in turn to more of the most far-reaching underlying oddities being fixed and sooner.\n\nSome initial threads I've opened there for discussion include:\n\nHow a commuter rail line finds itself in the class-tree of occurrence (Q1190554) and what should be do about it\n\nWhat the proper scope of subclasses should be for work (Q386724) (\"a distinct intellectual or artistic creation\")\n\npublication (Q732577) -- does this item relate only to publications as distinct objects, or does it also reflect the act of publishing (which could then cause trouble for queries)\n\n... and should an appropriate relation be specified for publication (Q732577) as a fixation of information (Q11028) ?\n\nProblems with the class-tree around sequence (Q133250), which can lead to newspapers being returned as examples of mathematical object (Q246672)s\n\nThe correct class-trees for items representing \"series of creative works\".\n\nemployment (Q656365) -- a contract (Q93288) or a social relation (Q853725) ?\n\n... and I am sure over the next few weeks there will be many more.\n\nOne thing that could certainly be improved would be the machinery of the page -- eg an easy button to create a new thread, permalinks for threads, auto-archiving of threads recently marked resolved, etc. I don't know whether it would be straightforward to add such functionality, such as is typically found on noticeboard pages on larger wikis. One option might be to go to Flow, rather than to develop a specific dedicated infrastructure for the page; though I have to say the edit-box in Flow feels rather unstable compared to the trusty text-area input of an ordinary wiki page, plus of course the recent de-prioritisation of development work on Flow; so any move to go with Flow would seem to come with a fair number of pros and cons.\n\nBut anyway, the page is now up; so I hope people will approve of its creation, and bring issues to solve, and solutions to fix them.\n\nWhat you want to do is to define an ontology. You have two ways to do it: the bottom-up or the top-down approach. Your page proposes a bottom-up approach starting by examples and classifying them by building a classification structure.\n\nThe best in my opinion is to start using a top-down approach with the two or three first levels at the top in order to have some objectives when starting to classify an element.\n\nHave a look at en:Upper ontology before starting anything and before doing anything new perhaps can we find an existing ontology which can meet our requirements.\n\nBut we add to answer some questions before doing any choice:\n\nwhat kind of granularity we want (what is the smallest concept we want to describe as instance)\n\nthe question of the inheritance\n\nInstead of a Wikidata page, we need a project for that and as we are speaking about general knowledge we need a general project to organize the whole structure but specific projects have to develop domain classifications because nobody can have an overview about everything. Snipre (talk)\n\nThe situation is that we have a load of items with classifications that do not pass the smell test. That is a matter of quality of what we have, not of defining an ontology. When as a consequence of stuff that does not pass the smell tests changes are proposed and implemented it is NOT either bottom to top or top to bottom it is from somewhere within the mess outwards. If this leads to clarity, I am all for it.\n\nYou have been bold and it may be of a benefit. You mention a meeting in London but you do not report on it, all you do is present us with what was suggested.. I am interested in the lines of thought. Thanks, GerardM (talk)\n\nGood ideal ! ({ {Ping|Snipre}} : before having something ideal in some sense, let's already try to have something that works ;) ) author TomT0m / talk page\n\nPS: related to this : Help:Modeling, I launched quite a while ago but did not really work. author TomT0m / talk page\n\nHi @GerardM: not much to report, in truth. It was only a small hacking session on Saturday, following the earlier Wikipedia Science Conference on Wednesday and Thursday (which I did not get to), and hackathon near Cambridge on Friday (which I did not get to either).\n\nThere were only about half a dozen of us there on Saturday, but at one point, talking with User:Daniel Mietchen and User:NavinoEvans, the talk turned to Wikidata, and the importance of including the full subclass tree when running searches instance <instance of X>, but then somebody said how you had to be careful doing that because there were so many odd things in the class tree, eg the Guardian newspaper coming up as an instance of \"event\", and what could we do to try to clean it up; and I think that's when somebody suggested that creating a dedicated noticeboard might act as an organising focus and also encourage activity, just as we have Wikidata:Interwiki conflicts already, or all the various noticeboards on en-wiki. The conversation didn't really develop any more than that, just the suggestion being raised, but it seemed to me not a bad idea, so I thought why not give it a try. That's about it really. Jheald (talk)\n\nYeah, not much to report, except that people in the room had no difficulty coming up with examples where such a noticeboard might be useful. My notes from the meeting (on bibliographic metadata, not classification) are here. --Daniel Mietchen (talk)\n\n@TomT0m: Nice draft page -- brings together a lot of useful stuff in one place. I've added it to the 'resources' at the top of the noticeboard page. Jheald (talk)\n\n@Snipre: I take your point, to some extent, but we do now have 250,000 subclass of (P279) statements already in play, and very nearly 14 million instance of (P31) statements, so there's a lot we already have in place; but it would be nice to iron out at least some of the more noticeable oddities, to make the searches work better.\n\nYou're also right that it can sometimes make a lot of sense to clean up top-down -- for example, even at the first level, the class tree of occurrence (Q1190554) shows some pretty odd inclusions. [3]\n\nYou're also right that there is certainly scope for refinement, both at the top end, and as regards choices of granularity -- for example, for people we insist that every item for a human being be an instance of human (Q5), with all other defining information being carried by properties; whereas for example for films there is really quite an extensive sub-tree of classes that an instance might belong to. No doubt our ontology will continue to evolve, such decisions could certainly be revisited, and I am sure that as time goes on we shall compare and benchmark against as many other ontologies as we legally can. But for the moment, rather than throwing everything out and starting again from scratch, it does seem to me to make some sense to try to eliminate some of the odder anomalies from what we've already got, to at least make the search queries work a bit better. Jheald (talk)\n\n@All, regarding Flow it seems I may have have stacked the picture a bit over-cautiously against it. Proclamations of its demise appear to be exaggerated. According to its original developer Jorm here, and this clarification message, it has not been abandoned, or even indefinitely put on ice -- dev suppport for it is not going to go away. But instead the focus from now is going to be how to better provide and support workflow features of typical project and noticeboard pages -- pages such as this very noticeboard -- rather than more general discussion-editing bells and whistles. So perhaps adopting Flow for the page should not be so quickly dismissed, but should still be seriously considered. Jheald (talk)\n\n@Jheald I never said that we should start from the scratch. But I tink your noticeboard will treat individual problems and you risk to modify after some weeks a classification branch you already modified previously and by the way you will destroy what you tried to correct. You need at some point a overview of the structure. Snipre (talk)\n\nHi all, I've written up the notes here for the discussions at the Hackathon, but nothing extra on this topic that hasn't been brought up (note: Wikimedia UK has an issue with the site's security certificate so you will probably get a warning from your browser if you follow the link). Many thanks @Jheald: being bold and setting up the notice board! NavinoEvans (talk)\n\n(I'm going to be using the WD:Glossary definitions of these terms here, even though they seem to have been a bit mixed up for some people (myself included on occasion) along the way. For clarification: Item means the real-world topic/subject, and entity is the thing on Wikidata. If I've gotten these mixed up right now, my apologies.)\n\nThe statements on a Wikidata entity represent claims regarding the item of that entity, not the entity itself. We don't put instance of (P31) Wikidata item (Q16222597) everywhere. Similarly, the statements are not regarding the Wikimedia articles linked to the entity. We don't (normally) put instance of (P31) Wikimedia article page (Q15138389) or its subclasses. There are exceptions to this, such as instances of Wikimedia list article (Q13406463). These pages tend to have unusually formed titles, that don't describe a topic, and instead describe the article page itself. For example, when one navigates to the page \"List of sovereign states\", the article doesn't go on to tell you all about an interesting list. The title describes the article page itself, not the topic, which is a decent way of telling that something's a bit different with this kind of article. Wikimedia article page (Q15138389), along with Wikimedia project page (Q14204246), Wikimedia main page (Q5296), and others, are subclasses of Wikimedia page outside the main knowledge tree (Q17379835). Wikidata item (Q16222597), strangely, is not, and is instead a subclass of Wikimedia internal item (Q17442446).\n\nWith that out of the way...\n\nI think we really need to be clearer on the distinction between entities linked to articles about the items and entities linked to articles that are the items. Wikimedia page outside the main knowledge tree (Q17379835) and Wikimedia internal item (Q17442446) (which should be merged, imo) should not be subclasses of MediaWiki page (Q15474042) or its numerous superclasses. No subclasses of either of these should also be subclasses of items within the main knowledge tree. Entities that have actual topics should not have any sort of should not be subclasses of these. Some professor whose area of study was history of China (Q82972) was (hopefully) not studying the aspect of history (Q17524420). The notable event known as the death of Osama bin Laden (Q19085) that occurred on 2 May 2011 was not a certain aspects of a person's life (Q20127274). The Canadian detainees at Guantanamo Bay (Q5030746) are not a Wikipedia overview article (Q20136634). The city of Luanda (Q3897) is definitely not a Wikinews article (Q17633526).\n\nI propose that all statements similar to these be removed, and the following pages be deleted:\n\nWikipedia overview article (Q20136634)\n\ncertain aspects of a person's life (Q20127274) (Fixed. --Yair rand (talk) )\n\nWikinews article (Q17633526)\n\nevents in a specific year or time period (Q18340514)\n\naspect of history (Q17524420)\n\ncultural depiction (Q20742825)\n\n--Yair rand (talk)\n\nSupport this effort. author TomT0m / talk page\n\nGlossary\n\n\"Item means the real-world topic/subject, and entity is the thing on Wikidata\" No, item is a special type of entities (properties are entities). An item is equally the real world concept and the stuff on Wikidata it maps to :) The glossary is not the easiest piece to write sometimes with successive rewrinting nonsenses emerges (next time I read it the (way secondary reification concept got totally out of control, don't know what happened.)author TomT0m / talk page\n\nAh, got it. I don't suppose we actually have an unambiguous term specifically for the real-world topic/subject? --Yair rand (talk)\n\n'Wikidata Entity' = 'Wikidata item (with Q number)' OR 'wikidata Property (with P number)' OR future Wikidata query (with some other reference)'.\n\nA Wikidata item is about a single topic and has statements about that topic. A ststatement has a property and a value. The value can be an item or a wikimedia Commons file or a web URL or a string or monolingual text (with specified language) or a date or a number or a number with specified unit. A statement may have qualifiers and references each with a property and a value.\n\nA wikidata item can be an instance or a class. An instance is a single individual and has a statement using the instance of (P31) property to link it to the class it is a member of. A class is a group of instances and has a statement using the subclass of (P279) property (or the parent taxon (P171) property for a biological taxon) linking it to a larger class. Some items are both a class and an instance of a particular type (or class) of class.\n\nFor Encyclopedias and biographical dictionaries on wikisource the topic that the item is about (or is an instance of (P31)) will be an 'encyclopedic article' or a 'biography'.\n\nA wikidata item has sitelinks to pages on wikimedia wikis which are about the same topic. The wikimedia wikis use these sitelinks to add interlanguage links between wikis in diffferent languages. Each wikidata item can have only one sitelink to a wiki. This is so that other wikis have only one language link to that wiki.\n\nBecause each wikidata item has only one sitelink to each wiki there can be a problem when a wiki has more than one page about a topic - separate wikidata items have to be created for each of these pages. Wiki Category pages, for instance, are on a different wikidata item from the item for the topic of that Category.\n\nSome wikimedia wiki pages describe a topic which is internal to wikimedia and not related to a real world topic, such as Template pages, disambiguation pages, Help pages etc. These pages also need language links so they need wikidata items with sitelinks. These items have statements identifying them as \"instance of (P31):MediaWiki page (Q15474042)\" or various subclasses of MediaWiki page (Q15474042).\n\nHope that helps. That Glossary really needs a rewrite. Joe Filceolaire (talk)\n\n\"political career of Arnold Schwarzenegger\"\n\nIndependently of the re-write of the glossary, what value for instance of (P31) do you suggest for \"political career of Arnold Schwarzenegger\" (Q3660742). Personally, I think \"partial biography article\" (Q20127274) is suitable. Obviously we can discuss if \"article\" should be in the item's label or not. @YMS:. --- Jura\n\nIt's quite clear to me it describes real world events known together as a political carreer. So I'd just use . It's a part of its life, just left to decide if a biography people is a description of someone's life, anb if we just can use something similar to or :) author TomT0m / talk page\n\nThe use of templates in your comments makes them hard to read for me. Your second sentences reads \"So I'd just use < partial biography article (Q20127274) (View with Reasonator) > instance of (P31) miga < Political carrer >\". Just to clarify: which item would have what statement(s)? --- Jura\n\nSeems pretty straightforward, there is even a manual if you type just\n\n⟨ subject ⟩ Wikidata property ⟨ object or value ⟩\n\n:) it's a simple subject/property/object triple, so the statement is on the subject, of course. author TomT0m / talk page\n\nOk. In that case, I tend to think you might have inverted the two. --- Jura\n\nIndeed. author TomT0m / talk page\n\npolitical career of Arnold Schwarzenegger (Q3660742) should have instance of (P31) \"political career\". Seems simple enough. --Yair rand (talk)\n\nand the currently non-existent \"political career\" item a statement \"subclass of partial biography article\"? --- Jura\n\nNo, subclass of \"career (Q282049)\" or similar. It would not be part of the Wikimedia page outside the main knowledge tree (Q17379835) set. --Yair rand (talk)\n\nSo to use \"partial biography article\" we would need to remove it from Wikimedia article page (Q15138389) (which I did earlier today), replace biographical article (Q19389637) with something else, and possibly rename it to \"certain aspects of a person's life\" ? --- Jura\n\n...and de-link the Polish article on biographies, remove all three existing statements associating the item to biography (Q36279), article (Q191067), and text (Q234460), and get rid of all existing labels, descriptions, and aliases, since none of these apply to the concept of \"certain aspect of a person's life\". At that point, I don't see why we'd be using certain aspects of a person's life (Q20127274) as a starting point in the first place. (Also, \"aspect\" might not be the best word here, but I can't think of a better one right now. Might be possible to get a bit more specific.) Arnold Schwarzenegger's political career is not a biography or text of any sort. --Yair rand (talk)\n\nQ20127274 doesn't have a link to a Polish article nor any aliases, but we can re-write some of the existing descriptions/labels. The advantage of having it is that it covers many items that had hardly any statements before. Obviously, if we can identify more specific aspects, such as the political career, new items can be created. --- Jura\n\nSorry, I got mixed up between Q20127274 and Q19389637 before. I see your point with regards to keeping the statements of items that point to it. If the labels can be replaced, then I agree it makes sense to use it. --Yair rand (talk)\n\nOk, I'd agree to make these changes. Let's see what YMS thinks. --- Jura\n\nI'm okay with anything that is a consistent system. Using items like Q20127274 was an easy solution for articles which are otherwise hard to classify. What would you do with first inauguration of Barack Obama (Q25094)? With religious views of Adolf Hitler (Q392636)? With Death and funeral of Pedro II of Brazil (Q5420282)? Or with the cited death of Osama bin Laden (Q19085), which actually is an interwiki conflict, with some articles describing a military operation, some the death of a person? What with Napoleon and the Jews (Q2916488), Abraham Lincoln in the Black Hawk War (Q4669055), later life of Isaac Newton (Q6495541)? All those are items for Wikipedia articles just describing some arbitrary aspects of some larger topic, and to find a suitable \"is a\" will be a guesswork every time. --YMS (talk)\n\nThey are all instances of events - or sequences or sets of events, aka. story ? , for sure. A death is an instance of death, an investiture is an instance of investiture ... Put the most precise you can think of. As the classes are hierarchically ordered (an investiture is a political event which is a US political event, ...), querying instances of a general one will return also the more specific ones. author TomT0m / talk page\n\nI have some difficulties seeing \"Napoleon and the Jews\" or \"Abraham Lincoln in the Black Hawk War\" as events. In fact, I have some difficulties seeing those as real-life entities at all, for me they are just Wikipedia articles. If that's my personal problem, I won't dare to block any progress here. But it seems like may others seem to have similar problems to find the right category to use, as most of the items of these kinds used to be classified as humans basically since the beginning of Wikidata. --YMS (talk)\n\nIt depicts and analyses a class of events in the case of Abraham Lincoln, all the events of the Black Hawk War involving Abraham Lincoln, or in which Abraham Lincoln influences. Otherwise it's an analysis of what he thought or how he acted in the Black Hawk War ... What does \"Napoleon and the Jews\" certainly describes a set of interaction (direct or indirect, through law voting) with the Jews ? Otherwise it describes a set of decisions Napoleon took on the Jews topic, I don't know. Interesting topic though :) Apart from that, these articles have definitely a defined topic. author TomT0m / talk page\n\nHm, this is a rather complicated issue. Maybe \"Napoleon and the Jews\" is a relationship of some sort? --Yair rand (talk)\n\nWould this do? Instance of career, with qualifiers \"of: Arnold Schwarzenegger\" and \"field of this profession: politics\" Popcorndude (talk)\n\nI would go with <instance of:political career> or maybe <instance of:career(applies to part:politics)> and <main subject (P921):Arnold Schwarzenegger (Q2685)>. I think <field of this profession:politics>is wrong because a \"career\" is not a profession. I think <main subject (P921):Arnold Schwarzenegger (Q2685)> is better than <of:Arnold Schwarzenegger (Q2685)> because it can be an independent statement and not just a qualifier. Joe Filceolaire (talk)\n\nI'd go with \"political career\" over simple \"career\" with an extra qualifier, but that's not such an important point. It definitely should not use main subject (P921). The primary point I've been trying to make is that these items should not be treated as works/articles. They don't have languages, publication dates, subjects, authors, etc. The distinction between the topic and the article itself is important. Arnold Schwarzenegger's career in politics did not have a main subject. A biographical article may have a subject, but that is not what the item is about. --Yair rand (talk)\n\nFollowing the discussion above, I changed the label of Q20127274 to \"certain aspects of a person's life\" and removed biographical article (Q19389637). --- Jura\n\nYair rand, Jura: What about facet of (P1269):Arnold Schwarzenegger (Q2685)? Joe Filceolaire (talk)\n\nSeems complementar and appropriate to me :) author TomT0m / talk page\n\nThat would work. --Yair rand (talk)\n\n\"History of\"\n\nThere are some 2916 item listed as instance of (P31) aspect of history (Q17524420). These are definitely linked to articles about a topic, so they shouldn't be treated as Wikimedia articles themselves. I'm unsure about how they should be treated, though. Is \"history of France\" a part of \"history of Europe\"? Maybe a subclass of it? Neither? Is it an instance of \"history\"? \"Time period\"? 121 items are listed as subclass of (P279) history of a country or state (Q17544377), and using it would mean that subclass of (P279) couldn't be used for lower-level history articles. 34 items have instance of (P31) history (Q309), and 143 items have subclass of (P279) history (Q309) statements. (Many of the former to actually be museums, strangely.) Thoughts? --Yair rand (talk)\n\n@Yair rand: History of france is a part of history of europe. History of france and history of europe are subclasses of history, in general. History of france is a subclass of \"history of a country\", and maybe \"history of a European country\" to refine further. author TomT0m / talk page\n\nWould history of the United States from 1980 to 1991 (Q2633338) be part of history of the United States (Q131110)? Would 1981 in the United States (Q2812799) be part of that? Or maybe both of those would use subclass? Would history of the Poles in the United States (Q16843880) be part of history of the United States (Q131110)? Also, would any of these have any instance of (P31) statements? --Yair rand (talk)\n\nQ17524420 has just been relabeled from \"Wikimedia history article\" to \"aspect of history\" by User:Michiel1972, with the description changed to \"article with an aspect of the history of something\". If the item is still to be used, the new label is very much an improvement, but the description still has the problem of treating items as Wikipedia articles. I'm also unclear on where this item fits into the general workings of history items. @Michiel1972: Could you comment on this? --Yair rand (talk)\n\nI do agree with the discussion above, these items are not included in wikidata because they are 'wikipedia articles' but because they are describing something (a detail, an aspect, a year, a part) of history of something. So I changed the label so it better fits the P31 usage, as I was mainly inspired by the change of label of certain aspects of a person's life (Q20127274) . Michiel1972 (talk)\n\nCould somebody quickly remind me:\n\nhow to add an edit summary to an edit ? &\n\nhow to see (and edit) the labels and descriptions in all languages for a particular item, not just my selected favourite languages?\n\nThanks in advance, Jheald (talk)\n\nSo apparently I can only add an edit summary when undoing or reverting an edit (Help:FAQ#Editing). Which is unfortunate; but I suppose I can make a very minor edit, then revert it, if there's a block of edits I want to explain... Jheald (talk)\n\n@Jheald:\n\nT47224 (Story) Allow detailed summaries in GUI\n\nT92759 allow editing of more languages in the in other languages box than the ones defined via babel boxes Open\n\nT61905 It should be possible to add a label in any eligible language Closed, Resolved\n\nI have no idea why manual edit summaries are not allowed at wikidata. It' s bad. --Atlasowa (talk)\n\nCustom edit summaries are not possible yet (without hacks) because Wikidata is a multilingual project and we try to make as much information available to the user in their language as possible. This includes the edit summary. --Lydia Pintscher (WMDE) (talk)\n\nHey everyone :)\n\nWe'll be doing the next Wikidata office hour on September 23rd at 17:00 UTC. See here for your timezone. We'll be meeting in #wikimedia-office on Freenode IRC. As usual I'll start with an overview of what's been happening around Wikidata since the last office hour and then we'll have time for questions and discussions.

We need to delete all (/شرح which means /doc) in Arabic Wikipedia intery. The link قالب:صندوق جبن/شرح will be then قالب:صندوق جبن. --Helmoony (talk)\n\n@Helmoony: This may be a useful list. --Daniel Mietchen (talk)\n\n@Daniel Mietchen Thank you. I've made some changes. Just one question, how can you explain that the example I mentionned above Q6717769 doesn't appear on google results ? --Helmoony (talk)\n\n@Helmoony: I have created a database query for you. There is also a regularly updated list which seems not to support Arabic suffixes. Matěj Suchánek (talk)\n\n@Matěj Suchánek That's extraordinary usefull. Thank you a lot. --Helmoony (talk)\n\nHello,\n\nI'd like to search systematically items with unsourced statements on specific properties (date of birth (P569) and date of death (P570) for a beginning).\n\nIs there a way to build a WDQ query checking if the statement is sourced or not ? and if not, is there another tool that could please help me ? --Hsarrazin (talk)\n\nYou should be able to do this with http://wdqs-beta.wmflabs.org/ . It uses SPARQL (Q54871) but not a lot of us are good with that. Multichill (talk)\n\nok, this is like Chinese to me — certainly very clear for a dev', but completely unreadable to ordinary contributors… :D\n\nis there someone who could help me build a query, please ?\n\nthe idea would be something like date of birth (P569)2004 (Q2014) and unsourced - ideal would be and linked to xxwiki. Thanks for help. --Hsarrazin (talk)\n\n@Hsarrazin: you can try something like this: https://phabricator.wikimedia.org/P1993 (note the limit - there are a lot of unsourced statements so without limit it will probably time out). If you also want to check for sitelinks then it's like this: https://phabricator.wikimedia.org/P1994 . Note it checks for language, if you want specific wiki then so far the only way is to filter URLs with SPARQL string functions. – The preceding unsigned comment was added by Smalyshev (WMF) (talk • contribs).\n\nCombined with a date range filter, that would be this. --Yair rand (talk)\n\nThanks a lot, this works fine, and the limit number for answers is ok, since I intend to complete those :)\n\none small question though, I had results that already had imported from Wikimedia project (P143) or reference URL (P854) sourcing. How can I filter those with no reference at all, or those with existing imported from Wikimedia project (P143) or reference URL (P854), but no stated in (P248) ? --Hsarrazin (talk)\n\nWQS: Searching for items with reference to \"Le Figaro\"\n\nFrom wikidata mailinglist: Searching for \"stated in\" \"Le Figaro\" (P:P248, Q216047):\n\nWQS query result: 347\n\nSee also: mw:Wikibase/Indexing/SPARQL_Query_Examples. --Atlasowa (talk)\n\nCan someone improve the query? better use count(?statement) rather than count(?ref), right? and post the WQS link? --Atlasowa (talk)\n\n@Atlasowa: Interestingly, changing count(?statement) to count(?ref) makes no difference -- count() here is essentially counting the number of identifiable cases where the subsequent algebra is true (ie the number of lines you would get from a SELECT query), regardless of whether it is ?ref or ?statement in that case which is being selected and then counted. So, even though it may not be what one might image at first sight, both are in fact equivalent to asking for just (count(*) as ?count), like this, without specifying either ?ref or ?statement.\n\nTo count the number of individual statements or refs, use DISTINCT -- giving 337 distinct statements, to 267 distinct references. Jheald (talk)\n\nThank you, Jheald! Can i ask some more?\n\n1) What is the difference between 337 distinct statements and 267 distinct references? Does it mean that wikidata has 267 items with LeFigaro references and 337 distinct statements with LeFigaro references (= some of the 267 items have several statements with LeFigaro references)? Is this interpretation correct?\n\n2) Can i get a list of the statements with reference to Le Figaro (or a list of items or both)?\n\n3) What about references to Le Figaro that do not use \"stated in\" (P:P248) but \"reference URL\" (P:P854, \"should be used for internet URLs as references\") like http://www.lefigaro.fr/flash-actu/2015/09/08/97001-20150908FILWWW00125-abe-reelu-a-la-tete-de-son-parti.php ? (See Help:Sources#Web_page) Is it possible to search for those references too?\n\nSorry for piling on more questions ;-) --Atlasowa (talk)\n\n@Atlasowa: I am only a newbie at this, but I think one can discover the subject, the property, and the object of the statement with a query like this: http:// tinyurl.com/nmkee2z (Can't link directly to the URL generated by the 'short URL' button on the query page, because the URL-shortener is blocked by the wiki software). [direct link]\n\nThere may well be neater ways to do this; and I haven't checked to see if it copes with statements with multiple values; but it's at least a start. Jheald (talk)\n\nAn example of where the same reference is used to support more than one statement occurs in the place of burial (P119) of Honoré Daumier (Q187506), as can be seen if we lock the '?subject' variable to Q187506 as in this query: tinyurl.com/p87rsd5. Jheald (talk)\n\nHere's the query tweaked to find statements that occur more than once: tinyurl.com/qcgwtty; investigating further, this occurs where the same statement is supported by more than one reference that fits the criteria, eg place of burial (P119) for Benoît Malon (Q2015151) as per this query, tinyurl.com/nmbblwp. Jheald (talk)\n\nAwesome, Jheald! Here's the [direct link], many thanks! --Atlasowa (talk)\n\n@Atlasowa: I think that this: tinyurl.com/pxlrkd7 is how one would do a search for a reference link including 'lefigaro.fr'. However, as you can see, the search is timing out. I think this is because the search service will be trying to build a list of all URLs used by reference URL (P854) before scanning it for lefigaro; but this first stage is taking too long.\n\nInterestingly, the LIMIT 10 directive, telling it to stop as soon as it's found ten, doesn't seem to be helping -- with a conventional SQL search this can often at least let you have a peek (and confirm your query is correct). I also tried searching for '^http://www.lefigaro.fr' -- ie this exact phrase specifically at the start of the URL, which should be slightly quicker to filter by; but probably not nearly enough to make the query fast enough. Even just trying to count the first ten also fails. tinyurl.com/q7y77bm Jheald (talk)\n\nThank you very much for your investigation, Jheald! There is Special:LinkSearch, which suggests that wikidata should find some links: https://www.wikidata.org/w/index.php?title=Special:LinkSearch&limit=100&offset=0&target=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.lefigaro.fr For example date of death (P:P570) of Q3313825. --Atlasowa (talk)\n\nI see the there is a lot of \"number\" entities in Wikidata like this: 2747 (Q19242825) - basically for every number. What is the purpose of those? Are we going to store all natural numbers in Wikidata one by one? That seems kind of pointless. They are created by User:PoulpyBot though the bot's description pages have no mention of why it is done. Anybody has explanation about this? --Laboramus (talk)\n\nQuite a lot of numbers are interesting/notable, so it would seem to be convenient to have the complete set up to a certain limit and then additional ones as necessary. How far to go? Well 1000 might have been a good place to stop; it seems that 10000 was chosen by User:Poulpy. Not sure it matters a great deal. MSGJ (talk)\n\nHey folks :)\n\nIt is time to give some more sister projects access to the sitelink or data part of Wikidata. The schedule is as follows:\n\nSeptember 22nd: Wikibooks will get access to statements (aka Phase 2)\n\nOctober 20th: Meta, Mediawiki and Wikispecies will get access to the sitelinks (aka Phase 1)\n\nPlease give them a warm welcome and watch Wikidata:Wikibooks, Wikidata:Meta-Wiki and Wikidata:Wikispecies for questions.\n\nCheers --Lydia Pintscher (WMDE) (talk)\n\nSince tinyurl.com is banned here, is there any other solution for URL shortening that is OK here? I understand the potential problems with spam, etc. but this seems to be a convenient way to post URLs for e.g. long SPARQL queries without having to actually paste in the whole query (which may also conflict with wiki formatting and cause other inconveniences). Any suggestions? --Smalyshev (WMF) (talk)\n\nSmalyshev (WMF) I think all URL shorteners are banned because of the cost to community time when abused. I see no way to URL shortening without someone making a very strong case for some exception.

Currently the query tinyurl.com/po9nxyv reveals 125 incidences where that has been done. Here is also the equivalent search on WDQ, , which uses a special fake item number to represent no value.\n\nOn the edit screen for an item, start to add the property, then when the input box comes up, hit the icon immediately to the left of the input box with three little horizontal bars. This will reveal the special option \"no value\", allowing you to make an edit like this: (diff).

Looks better now (probably still not 100 % perfect) --2A02:810D:27C0:5CC:F1F0:D92B:87DF:76BD\n\nI am very confused with what's going on with \"school of education\". We seem to have two entries with that English label intended to mean the generic term for a college that trains teachers - school of education and professor seminary. The first lists just 'de' and 'en' wikipedia links, both of which look like they describe what I would expect. The second also has a 'de' link to a different page - \"Lehrerseminar\" which seems to be a historical entity rather than the current term for a German teacher's college; and it has many other language links as well (but not 'en'). Meanwhile there seem to be some other inconsistent language links on the various language-specific pages, for example I would have expected the page 'École supérieure de pédagogie' in French wikipedia to be linked as it is the French label for school of education, but that is instead linked to Q17000323 which is indicated as a disambiguation page... Any suggestions how to fix this all up? I think school of education is right and should just be linked to more pages in different languages somehow? ArthurPSmith (talk)\n\nIn Help:FAQ#Other Wikimedia sites, #1, there is actually no answer given. It would be really helpfull, if someone that knows the whole development of Wikidata, offer some date, when the process of integration is expected to end, for example midst of 2017 or in about 3 or 4 years... Many linking work would be spared in local wikis knowing that. --Janezdrilc (talk)\n\nThere is currently no progress towards integration with Wikispecies or most Wiktionaries, so no date can be offered. Wikispecies has no interest in integration, and the challenges of Wiktionary integration have hit major snags, in part because the data structure of the Wiktionaries does not match that used by Wikidata. --EncycloPetey (talk)\n\nThank you for this information. Just one more question: Is there any plan to introduce existing sister project links into all local wikis (like this way or maybe this way) and when about is that going to take place? --Janezdrilc (talk)\n\nYes that is planned. The ticket for it is phabricator:T103102. There is no timeline for it yet. --Lydia Pintscher (WMDE) (talk)\n\nThere are also plans for the wikidata software to be used on Commons to encode the metadata for each file and internationalise it. This is on hold for the moment but is (as I understand it) a fairly high priority. Joe Filceolaire (talk)\n\nI tried to ask to the Italian Bar, but no answer. So the problem is the links to VIAF to some Italian buildings are totally wrong, and I don't know how to correct this, so I am leaving this note.\n\nPalazzo Alberti Q16163465 on Wikidiata is a palace in Florence, on Viaf in Sansepolcro\n\nPalazzo Bardi-Serzelli Q16585968, on Viaf is actually palazzo Busini Bardi Q3889596\n\nPalazzo Bargagli Q16585972, on Wikidata is a palace in Florence, on Viaf in Siena (sarebbe Q3889601)\n\nPalazzo Mancini Q16586227, on wikidata is a palace in Florence, on Viaf in Roma (sarebbe Q3360896)\n\nPalazzo Strigelli Q16586343, on wikidata is a palace in Florence, on Viaf in Palazzuolo sul Senio\n\nPalazzo Bonaparte Q19721646, on wikidata is a palace in Florence, on Viaf in Rome (sarebbe Q3889693)\n\nVia Garibaldi Q16620946, on Wikidata is a street in Siena, on Viaf in Genoa (sarebbe Q2343106)\n\nCollegio degli Scolopi Q19984666, on Wikidata is a palace in Florence, on Viaf in Pieve di Cento e Urbino\n\nMuseo dell'Opera Metropolitana del Duomo Q869130, on wikidata in a museum in Siena, on Viaf in Perugia (sarebbe Q3868002)\n\n--Sailko (talk)\n\nSo they are not well identified. The obvious solution remove the VIAF identification for now. GerardM (talk)\n\nThere are a lot of wrong identifications at the side of VIAF. I still don't know why a bot imported them all without checking. Sjoerd de Bruin (talk)\n\nI am glad they were imported. Yes, there may be errors, but now they are checked and otherwise nobody would bother. Thanks, GerardM (talk)\n\nHello.Is there a contradiction between this item and this Wikipedia template?This template prevents interwiki links from appearing.Because it determines the appearance of a particular copies --ديفيد عادل وهبة خليل 2 (talk)\n\nIn which sitelink(s)? --- Jura\n\nI just note your addition to your comment. It's likely that this is something that needs to be fixed at Wikipedia, not Wikidata. --- Jura\n\nOriginated from this set of fixes for the Russian version of the Main page. Because of locale set globally to en-US (I assume), native language specific formatting tools are useless. So for number formatting or plural forms I had to write independent modules. Say instead of just {{NUMBEROFARTICLES}} having {{#invoke:String|replace|{{NUMBEROFARTICLES}}|,| }}. It would be more convenient to set locale to ru-RU for the page, or to have an optional argument overriding default locale like {{NUMBEROFARTICLES|locale=ru-RU}} I am not sure if this is within the scope of this forum yet to mention the problem. --NeoLexx (talk)\n\nIt's so fucking slow. And why does it not allow me to just type {{Q}} or {{P}}?--Kopiersperre (talk)\n\nThere is a button to switch between wikitext and visual mode. It can't be disabled, because it's enabled per page.

For example, „Missing” items in the interval [Q19200000, Q19299999] would be 5970 items deleted after creation? --Atlasowa (talk)\n\n(note: per below: I inverted blue and red --- Jura\n\n„Missing” refers to the json dump, where redirs and deleted items are not present. So the red bar is the sum of redirected and deleted items. An execption is the last bar, which contains not yet created items. --Succu (talk)\n\nI like it. It gives a chronological perspective on the no-statements problem. Personally, I might have used the colors differently. I think the variation in missing items is odd, but less important than missing statements. --- Jura\n\nJura, feel free to change the colors in that line: | colors = #0000FF : #FFFFFF : #FF0000. --Succu (talk)\n\nOk, I inverted blue and red, so we still have stalagmites and stalactites. --- Jura\n\nVery nice user:Succu! Make sure to put this somewhere more permanent too and findable from Wikidata:Statistics.\n\nHow hard is it to produce these kind of nice diagrams for a specific subset of items? Say for example I would like to have it for instance of (P31) -> painting (Q3305213)? Multichill (talk)\n\nIf the items all have instance of (P31): painting (Q3305213) then they all exist (not blue) and they would all have at least 1 statement (not red). So then all the items would be white, or are you asking about slightly different? Popcorndude (talk)\n\nI guess he wouldn't get any stalactites, but one could still try to do batches of equal size by QID to visualize the number of statements per item, a bit like this (which isn't by QID). --- Jura\n\nThis should not be to hard to implement, but not out of the box. A solution could be to use a fourth bar (one reducing the size of the \"white\" bar). --Succu (talk)\n\nBut, Multichill, showing around 106,000 items this way would not be very impressive. ---Succu (talk)\n\nTo impress is not the goal Succu :-). I would love to have it to see the progress of Wikidata:WikiProject sum of all paintings. Multichill (talk)\n\nA fourth bar would look like in Distribution of P225. --Succu (talk)\n\nJura, I created a color variant on my user page. Meaning green = good, yellow = attention, red = bad ;) --Succu (talk)\n\nI guess we don't agree what is bad ;) --- Jura\n\n>10% of redirects/deletions (2.4 million items): it does seem like a lot. --- Jura\n\nI would call this often unnecessary part as „bad”. Items generated by automated processes that say only „We have your sitelink” are of limted help. I think the old intewiki bots did a better job. --Succu (talk)\n\nMoved to the Wikidata:SPARQL query service/suggestions page\n\nI am curious if we have a process for deleting items that become orphaned? For example, an item that has only one sitelink then that page is deleted on Wikipedia (or sister project) for reasons such as lack of notability / spam. Now the item is orphaned (e.g. unused on Wikidata) and also probably not notable here.\n\nI know that the site link automatically gets deleted, but then what? Aude (talk)\n\nThere a few queries trying to track these (focusing on nearly empty items) and eventually they end up on Wikidata:Requests for deletions where they get nuked. --- Jura\n\nthe fact that an item does not exist on wikipedia doesn't mean it has to be deleted. Such items can be used to store info (I think of people, especially), in order to be able to use them for \"lists of\", even if there is not enough info to build a real sourced wp-article ;) --Hsarrazin (talk)\n\nWell, sometimes we get several items as they keep deleting and re-creating articles at WP. ;) --- Jura\n\nGood point about items suitable for a list, though I see a lot that probably don't fit that (e.g. stuff deleted for promotional / spam reasons).\n\nIn going through deletion requests on enwiki, I realized this might be somewhat an issue here and thought maybe there could be a tool or something to help, though sounds like we already have something. (where?) I don't think we would want to automatically delete items, but report them so humans can review them. Aude (talk)\n\nA good style is that if you close an AfD request on enwiki as delete, and there are no interwiki links, to delete the Wikidata item as a part of the deletion process.--Ymblanter (talk)\n\nThat's what I do and agree would be nice, but in practice I think most admins don't take care of this. (they probably don't realize or think of it) Aude (talk)\n\nNo, most of them do not. This is why we have the instruments listed below.--Ymblanter (talk)\n\nSee User:Pasleim/Items for deletion/Page deleted‎], there are bot runs on the easy ones. Sjoerd de Bruin (talk)\n\nThere is also User:Pasleim/Items for deletion/Category for categories, which requires some extra care because categories which have been speedy moved also end up there, but they should not be deleted.--Ymblanter (talk)\n\nThanks for the links :) Aude (talk)\n\nI just changed the interwiki link for one of our lemmas on sw-wiki. I noticed that I was close to making a mistake - as I luckily did not proceed to the end I am not sure if there is a kind of brake on that risk.\n\nI went on the \"edit links\" button on my swwiki-page and get on the \"wikipedia\"-box at the \"ecology (Q7150)\" entry, hit edit and see 139 entries. So i start removing languages, because I do not want to have my sw-lemma linked to these. After hitting delete 20,30 times I grow tired and think \"There must be another way\". So I start looking for faqs, find nothing and go back to my edit window and ONLY NOW remember that I just have to remove my sw-lemma from this screen, so that I can later link it to another item on wikidata.\n\nI feel relieved that I did not hit the \"save\" button yet. Would I have erased the interwiki link to (Q7150) for these 20,30 languages ? Did you notice that this happens sometimes or am I the only idiot?\n\nWell I did change interwiki links before, but not often and this morning I was wired the other (wrong) way round. And for my morning mindset I could not find any hint how to change an interwiki link for a lemma that belongs somewhere else. Presently I feel like putting a short warning / hint just on top of the list you see after you hit \"edit links\" on your wikipedia page. \"For a change of interwiki links remove your language from this list, then go back to your article and link anew to the desired item\". Kipala (talk)\n\nI don't see what's the problem here? Sjoerd de Bruin (talk)\n\nIf it happened only to me - no problem. If it happens more often - put in some brake. Kipala (talk)\n\nDon't worry. It's a wiki, so you can edit it, but you shouldn't be able to break permanently ;)\n\nBTW, I think there is an edit filter running on that. --- Jura\n\nMaybe was a problem on label. Now I changed it for sw lang. --ValterVB (talk)\n\nBut is this the reason why I see so much users removing all sitelinks? Sjoerd de Bruin (talk)\n\nWell, I guess if your interface language is set to a language that doesn't have a label for the item and you come from an article convinced that you are on the item for that article, the logical thing to do could be to remove all conflicting sitelinks? --- Jura\n\nYesterday, while cleaning data-twins (see above), I noticed another problem of the same kind. When, on a wp, the need for for disambiguation appears, the original name generally becomes the disambiguation page.\n\nIn this case, I found 3 cases, yesterday, where the original human (Q5) items (with iw-links) held the disambiguation. The new page for the person was created with a new name, and another wd item created with data added, hence creating a duplicated item. Those are rather difficult to trace if the new item is not completed with claims. There may be a lot of them, unnoticed. They require quite a lot of work to clean up, and could lead to accidental wipeouts. :/ --Hsarrazin (talk)\n\nThis is the second time I am experiencing difficulty 1) finding where to propose a property (searching the discussion page of similar properties does not lead me where I need to go) and 2) proposing the property with the example template (syntax errors). Can somebody please fix this for me: https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Wikidata:Property_proposal/Creative_work#Bildindex thx, --Jane023 (talk)\n\nFixed by Jura1 here. --Stryn (talk)\n\nPlease head over to Wikidata:Property_proposal/Generic#Generic_or_Specific:_Vote_here and give your opinion on how many mass properties we need. --Tobias1984 (talk)\n\nIs technically possible to create a filter to detect addition of sitelinks to Commons categories in entries compused solely of entries on NS:0 from Wikipedia (and/or NS:AUTHOR from Wikisource; that have an id number inconsistency across Wikisources)? This will be helpfull to detect changes as [4]+[5]. Lugusto (talk)\n\nThere are a lot of people on Wikidata, who are focussing on Commons sitelinks. But the most don't know what they are doing, removing links and merging categories with articles... Sjoerd de Bruin (talk)\n\nok, I thought Commons categories were to be added only in Commons category (P373) on items which are not Wikimedia category (Q4167836) (i.e. subjects of the Commoncat), and to Commons wikilinks on Wikimedia category (Q4167836). Am I right ? is there a page with recommandations about that, or is there no consensus yet ? --Hsarrazin (talk)\n\n@555: The really important thing is to add a Commons category (P373) statement in such cases, as that is the canonical way to show an item has a related Commons category.\n\nIf we do want to stop people making sitelinks from article-items to Commons categories (the conclusion that was sort-of adopted from this discussion), we need a bot to enforce it. As the statistics I posted a couple of weeks ago show, over 100,000 such 'cross-namespace' sitelinks were created in the last 12 months -- a more than doubling in number.\n\nWe need to take a decision, either to enforce the no cross-namespace links rule, or to abandon it. Doing nothing is effectively the latter.\n\nBut the one thing that is important is to add the Commons category (P373)s, as the one guaranteed way to be able to show such a linkage. Jheald (talk)\n\n@Hsarrazin: Note that it is also worth adding a Commons category (P373) on category-like items here that have a corresponding category on Commonscat, as with the present sitelinking muddle, it cannot be guaranteed that such category <-> category relationships with be discoverable by a sitelink (the sitelink may have been taken by an article <-> commonscat sitelink). Currently, per the statistics linked just above, about 80% of category-items with known related commonscats have Commons category (P373)s. It would be good if this were nearer 100%. Jheald (talk)\n\n\"If we do want to stop people making sitelinks from article-items to Commons categories (the conclusion that was sort-of adopted from this discussion)\" <- This is a false representation of the situation. This is what Jheald wants, but it is NOT the conclusion. See for instance:\n\n\"James Heald, 27/08/2015 11:29: > I believe we have clear policy on only sitelinking commons categories to category-like items, and commons galleries to article-like items;\" - No, we don't, or at least none has been shown. Please don't spread unsubstantiated policy claims.\n\nas long if there is no software improvement for Commons, the status quo that both articles and categories are used as sitelink for Commons will remain the situation.\n\n--Atlasowa (talk)\n\nIn the Netherlands polders often had dikes that broke at some stage. How do I register such events? Thanks, GerardM (talk)\n\nsignificant event (P793)? Multichill (talk)\n\nThanks, like this ?\n\nerr... do you think \"dijkdoorbraak\" is \"en\" ? shouldn't it be \"nl\" rather ? if you got \"en\" too, would be nicer to translate in other languages ;) --Hsarrazin (talk)\n\nWe do not communicate the much on how Wikidata is used in various Wikis, so here is a quick summary about French Wikipedia:\n\nWikidata retrieving funcitons have been added to some traditional infoboxes, as a default when there is no value. Some other infobox templates have been rewritten in Lua, which is better suited to more sophisticated things like fr:Grand Prix de Fourmies 2015 (by user:Jérémy-Günther-Heinz Jähnick). Values are usually accompanied by a backlink to Wikidata, and tracked in fr:Category:Page utilisant Wikidata par propriété‎. One generic biographical infobox, fr:Template:Infobox Biographie2 template has been created from scratch and bot-added to ca 60k items.\n\nWikidata has trigged length, loopy debates. The \"biographie2\" template in particular has been criticized by some, and widely used by others. The bot adding it has been stopped. Criticisms of Wikidata usage are very diverse, with some main clusters:\n\nwe are frwiki, we don't want to depend on another site, and certainly not a geeky database (that seems to be a minority)\n\ndata are low quality and badly sourced\n\nWikidata is too hard to understand, I don't want to have to spend my time there\n\nedits are hard to track in watchlist, and not visible in page history (the most cogent arguments imo)\n\nHeated debates there but it seems that when Wikidata has been implemented in a template for a while, things settle pretty well. --Zolo (talk)\n\nLUA-templates can avoid use of data that has Wikipedia as source or no source at all, right? That seems like a good step first. Sjoerd de Bruin (talk)\n\nIt can, but that would exclude just about everything. Even though there are complaints about data quality, unsourced data is usually better than no data. --Zolo (talk)\n\nI guess that depends on the what statement you use. -- Innocent bystander (talk)\n\nIn many cases, automatically uploaded data, often from infoboxes, has a reference to xxwiki. That in my opinion is a poor (secondary) source and should not qualify as such. At least the rank of such a reference should be \"history\". Poul G (talk)\n\nIn an effort to update da:Module:Wikidata I did a review of some of the other implementations. By design they are so different, that it's hardly fair to claim, that they are really the same (same Q). I found the french to be the best design. I would support an effort to converge, ultimately with the same Lua-code in the core modules. That would require the module-names, including sub-modules, published functions and documentation to be in the same language (english). Texts shown to our readers should come from language-configurations, eg. i18n = mw.loadData(\"Wikidata/i18n/\"..mw.language.getContentLanguage():code), with fallbacks from mw.language:getFallbackLanguages. Default formatting should rely on mw.language with posible escapes parameterized like value-module in the spanish version (inspiration for our danish, but now only readable by spanish-speaking people). Poul G (talk)\n\nSomewhat funny that WMFDE develops it and it gets used first on frwiki, but not on dewiki --- Jura\n\nI have tried to write the frwiki module in such a way that it can be exported, but as it came to rely on existing local modules, it did not work 100%. Surely we can draw inspiration from each other, but as long as we can't store modules in a central place, keeping them really in synch sounds a bit difficult. Another complicating factor is the particular habits of each Wiki (in the present case, the way frwiki likes to pack three internal links into every single date). --Zolo (talk)\n\nThe value-module/-function can handle dates with multiple links; maybe it could be reduced to one field, like formatter=Module.function. Poul G (talk)\n\nWP's like wp:de, wp:es, wp:en, wp:nl, wp:it etc. individually generate almost identical tables of the yearly changing team members array and the event (race) results from one source: Union Cycliste International. Isn't this a field of data processing that can be restructured and simplified here? --MaxxL (talk)\n\n@MaxxL: Please contact user:Jérémy-Günther-Heinz Jähnick: he is working a lot to develop a data structure and infobox in lua in the field of cyclism.\n\n@Jérémy-Günther-Heinz Jähnick: You can provide some info I think. Snipre (talk)\n\n@MaxxL: Hi. The project Wikidata:Cycling is larger that you can guess. I have write a small presentation in English here. To respond at your question, we list cyclists thanks to has part(s) (P527) in the seasons item, like CCT-Champion System 2015 (Q19336144). We can add precisions thanks to qualifiers. Infos like the country or the previous team will be contain in the item of the cyclists. These informations were also used when we will write classifications. In the articles on Wikipedia, the entries of the table will be ordered thanks to P1964 (P1964), contained in cyclist'item. It lacks me the solution (a template) to establish this table on an article in the French Wikipedia. After tests, it will be translate in around 20 languages.
