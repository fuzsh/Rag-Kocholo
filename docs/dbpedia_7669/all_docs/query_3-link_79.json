        "text": "As a champion bodybuilder, he’s a five-time Mr. Universe winner. As an actor, he became the biggest action hero in Hollywood. And as a politician, from 2003 to 2011, he was governor of California — the most populousbevölkerungsreichpopulous U.S. state, which, if it were a country, would be the world’s fifth-largest economy.\n\nThese are just the best-known successes in Arnold Schwarzenegger’s remarkably diversevielgestaltig (auch: facettenreich)diverse career. He’s also a smart businessman, reportedly making his first million from real estate (US)Immobilienreal-estate investments even before he was famous. He told author Tim Ferriss, for the book Tools of Titans: “I saw, over the years, the people that worked out in the Fitnessstudiogymgym and that I met in the acting classSchauspielunterrichtacting classes, they were all very vulnerableverletzlich (hier: in einer prekären Situation)vulnerable because they didn’t have any money, and they had to take anything that was offered to them because that was their livinghier: Broterwerbliving. I didn’t want to get into that situation.”\n\nArnie’s rules for success\n\nHe may be in his mid-70s, but Schwarzenegger is still making movies and still to right a wrongein Unrecht wiedergutmachenrighting wrongs he sees in the world. Always a believer in California as a land of opportunity, he has helped attract investment to the state, particularly in its technology companies. Now a cult figure and inspiring motivational speaker, when Arnie speaks, people listen. He often gets invited to speak at tech events, such as Bits & Pretzels in Munich in 2022, so that he can share the principles that have guided him to success.\n\nIn everything I ever did, the thing that I heard out of people’s mouths was: ‘That’s impossible’\n\n1. Have a vision\n\n“If you don’t have a vision of where you’re going, you to drift aroundsich umhertreiben lassendrift around and you never end up anywhere,” he says. While growing up near Graz, in Austria, he discovered a bodybuilding magazine that to feature sb.jmdn. zeigen (hier: über jmdn. berichten)featured Reg Park, a British bodybuilding champion and star of several Hercules films of the 1960s. In that magazine, Schwarzenegger saw the “blueprintBlaupause, Planblueprint” for his own life and career. By that time, he already felt that Austria was too small for him. His parents may have wanted him to join the police, like his father, but young Arnie had his to have one’s sights set on sth.etw. anvisierensights set on America and Hollywood — and he knew bodybuilding would get him there.\n\n2. Don’t listen to the naysayers\n\nEven Schwarzenegger’s friends and family didn’t believe anyone could be a bodybuilding champion, suggesting that he try something more conventional, like skiing or cycling. And when he wanted to work in movies, he says that agents and studio executiveManager(in)executives laughed at him, saying his 250-pound (113-kilogram) body and strong accent meant he could never be a box-office starKinostarbox-office star in Hollywood. “[In] everything I ever did, the thing that I heard out of people’s mouths was: ‘That’s impossible. That can’t be done.’ But you know what? I didn’t sb. didn't give a shit (vulg.)es war jmdm. scheißegalgive a shit.”\n\nAgain and again, he has proved the naysayerPessimist(in)naysayers wrong, but it wasn’t easy. In his first movie, Hercules in New York — a film that, he says, “went right into the toilet” — Schwarzenegger’s voice was to dub sth.etw. synchronisierendubbed by an American actor. But still, he wasn’t discouraged. With hard work, he turned his body and voice into assetKapitalassets. Schwarzenegger remembers: “[Terminator director] James Cameron said: ‘What really makes this movie work is Arnie talks like machine.’ I don’t know if it was meant as a compliment.”\n\n3. Work your ass off\n\nHaving a vision is important, but you must then be prepared to, as Schwarzenegger says, “to work one’s ass off (vulg.)sich zu Tode schuftenwork your ass off.” Consider that his first film was in 1970 and his breakthrough role, in Conan the barbarianBarbar(in)Barbarian, came in 1982. That’s 12 years of working towards his goal — trying, often failing, but never giving up. He describes spending five to six hours a day in the gym while also going to college, working in a construction job and attending acting classes in the evenings. “There is no magic out there. You cannot get around it — you have to work and work and work.” Even after his signature rolecharakteristische Rolle (hier: Paraderolle)signature role, in The Terminator (1984), had catapulted him to global fame, Schwarzenegger continued to to hone sth.etw. verfeinernhone his skills, showing in films like twinZwillingTwins (1988) and Kindergarten cop (ifml.)Bulle, PolizistCop (1990) that there was more depth to his acting than just robots and tough guy (ifml.)harter Kerltough guys.\n\nThe Governator takes charge\n\nIn 2003, Schwarzenegger’s career took a new and, for many, unexpected turn when he to run for sth.hier: für etw. kandidierenran for governor in the state of California. But perhaps it shouldn’t have come as such a surprise. At the time, Schwarzenegger was married to the journalist Maria Shriver (the couple to divorcesich scheiden lassendivorced in 2021), and this made him a member of America’s political “royal family” — the Kennedys. Former President John F. Kennedy was Shriver’s uncle.\n\nSchwarzenegger has said he began thinking about going into politics in the late 1990s, a time when he was already politically active, promoting after-school programs in public schools, for example. The U.S. constitutionVerfassungConstitution allows only native-born Americans to be president, so Schwarzenegger became the “governatorWortschöpfung aus „governor“ und „terminator“Governator,” to take charge of sth.das Kommando über etw. übernehmentaking charge of California instead.\n\nWhile his overallgesamtoverall political legacy is considered “mixed,” he is to be credited for sth.Anerkennung für etw. bekommencredited for to take sth. onhier: etw. angehentaking on essential but (at the time) unglamorous issueProblem, Angelegenheitissues, like infrastructure and the environment. As governor, Schwarzenegger also to appoint sb.jmdn. ernennenappointed people to public office without caring which party they came from. Republican leaders may not have liked it, but Schwarzenegger has always been more pragmatic than partisanparteilichpartisan. “It has nothing to do with ‘Republican versus Democrat,’” he told The New York Times. “I never paid attention to any of this political stuff, periodPunktperiod, because I think that both are full of to be full of crap (vulg.)hier: Scheiße laberncrap.”\n\nYou cannot get around it — you have to work and work and work\n\nLast (action) hero?\n\nMore than a decade after leaving office, Schwarzenegger is still the most popular Republican in America, according to YouGov surveyUmfragesurveys, and he continues to be a leader in public life. Waiting for his Covid vaccination, he encouraged others to get vaccinated with a famous line from the Terminator films: “Come with me if you want to live!” And after Trump supporters attacked the U.S. Capitol on January 6, 2021, Schwarzenegger made an emotional speech comparing that incidentVorfallincident to the Kristallnacht attacks on JewJude/JüdinJews by the Nazis in 1938. The video of that speech has had tens of millions of views."
