        "text": "https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/oportebit#Latin refers only to oporteo, not oportet, of which it is also a future form. 89.23.224.97\n\nIt's an odd one since they are functionally the same verb, just that only one sense is personal. The OLD and L&S have them under one lemma. If they are being treated as separate then I guess both should be listed there, yeah, though given that the only extra attested form for the personal sense seems to be the 3rd person plural I wonder if having a single lemma would be better. —Al-Muqanna المقنع (talk)\n\nYes, I think it would. Thanks for answering. How do I get someone to volunteer to do that? I don't feel experienced enough in neither Latin dictionaryty, nor wiktionarian editing to do it myself. But one or the other would be nice, because I got mislead to the wrong lemma looking up oportebit. 89.23.224.121\n\nDefinition is unclear. What is meant by \"illegitimate\" in the definition? It seems to be saying that it is illegitimate to believe in the law, which is obviously self-contradictory. I imagine in fact this phrase (though I've never heard it before) is just an exhortation not to use the word \"illegal\" to refer to people. Equinox ◑\n\nI've heard it before, but allways thought it is a quote of somebody, not a phrase. It is similar to \"property is theft\" or \"eat the rich\". Tollef Salemann (talk)\n\nIf we want to have these – technically they aren’t even covered by the inclusion criteria but need a special case, similar to our Wiktionary:Phrasebook project or in expansion of it (“which phrases should I learn to become a successful entryist in another country’s politics?”) – then we should not categorize as “language proverbs” but as “language political slogans”. It is only the form of the assertion that allows an editor to claim it to be “a phrase expressing a basic truth which may be applied to common situations” as we now define proverb, but the actual speech act is to demand a certain treatment of people according to human dignity not exhausted by avoiding some objectifying language. We could also add Yankee go home, Ausländer raus and the analogy Nazis raus and for such demands it is even more patently inappropriate to declare them proverbs.\n\nThese entries appear to have a merit because as even this example shows, there is a need for explanation, though largely ideological contextualization. From the same author: scratch a liberal and you'll find a fascist – apparently she finds much commendable in this direction.\n\nThey are disrecommendable however because some of the attested phrases fall within the scope of an offence and thus even promoting them by phrasebook entry might be illegal according to the logics of some public prosecutors, who are definitely as smart as those who edit Wiktionary to “protect the trademarks” of their clients. Otherwise why wouldn’t one add the rhyming phrase Wer Deutschland liebt, ist Antisemit (“Whoso for Deutschland woos, must despise them Jews”) which has been recorded a few years ago but now waned mostly because of criminal sentences according to § 130 sect. 1 of the German criminal code? If it rhymes it is extra-inclusionworthy, was probably the thought of the IP editor who added diversity is perversity to our English rhyming phrases.\n\nOverall I am concerned more about what audience is attracted than about the documentation of the matter per se. Fay Freak (talk)\n\nI don't doubt that this has the force of an admonishment proverb in some contexts. If indeed proverbs come in pairs, what will be the partner for this one? Will we treat it equally? DCDuring (talk)\n\nignorantia juris non excusat :) Equinox ◑\n\nThat might might be a good test for proverbiality: If there isn't a contradictory partner, it isn't a proverb, it's a phrase! DCDuring (talk)\n\nLike Tollef, I've heard this but would not have thought of it as something to include in a dictionary: it's a slogan, like \"leave means leave\" or \"no child left behind\" or \"make American great again\". Including abbreviations is one thing (TINA, TATA, MAGA), but I would not have thought of slogans themselves as dictionary material, at least not when the basic meaning is intelligible from the individual meanings of the words. OTOH we do include some other comparably-transparent slogans like black lives matter and police lives matter, so who knows. - -sche (discuss)\n\nIm not defending to have slogans here, don't get me wrong. Wiktionary is not a corpus. But does any policy exist to what of phrases include or not? 'Cause otherwise just nominate for deletion all the slogans. Not all words put together which has a certain fast use must be in a dictionary.\n\nAnd above all the stuff said by Fay Freak, i also wonder about the definition of slogan and quote. Bible has some thousands of phrases actively used here and there, but is it really good idea to include stuff like \"the righteous will stay alive by his faithfulnes\" and \"snarling like dogs they prowl trough the city\" just because some groups of people use this for defending their political views by giving it a certain definition which is not directly seen in the phrases themselfs?\n\nI think it is weird to include political phrases 'cause allmost every phrase has a political context, and every quote of any book of historical cultural importancy has a political context, so literally everithing can be used as a slogan. What's the criteria? Tollef Salemann (talk)\n\nThe first Bible quote feels provebial to me. Maybe it is one. CitationsFreak (talk)\n\nI have a quibble with the new version of the entry. Do people use this phrase to refer to calling non-immigrants illegal? I've only heard it as a reference to Central/South-American immigrants entering American undocumentedly, especially after Trump. CitationsFreak (talk)\n\nIf you're not a North Korean citizen, and you waltz your way into North Korea, you are illegal. Doesn't matter how documented you may or may not be. Leasnam (talk)\n\nYou can go to North Korea legally through China. CitationsFreak (talk)\n\nNot too strictly speaking, in modern law, actions are what are illegal generally, not entities that perform illegal actions. DCDuring (talk)\n\nThe Verb has a synonym section for \"increase one's muscle mass\", but the definition is only \"to become big\", nothing about muscles or workouts. Equinox ◑\n\nI guessed that it would be easy to cite the \"increase one's strength/muscle mass\" sense, but I only found one cite in Google's big four corpora. I even find the \"hype\" sense on body-building/athletics websites. DCDuring (talk)\n\nWe define this as \"Having sharp, razor-like leaves\" and say it's from xyro- + -philic, but we only have -philic defined as \"loving, having affinity for\". Are we missing a biology/botany sense of -philic which explains xyrophilic meaning \"having razor-like leaves\", or is this a weird one-off use of -philic, or is the definition of xyrophilic wrong, or what? Is -philic here an error for -phyllous, -phyllic? - -sche (discuss)\n\nThey are all pronounced …fɪl…, right? So add {{IPA}} and {{homophone}} for some suffixes at least, if not {{misconstruction of}}. While the native speakers have difficulties in spelling, to the non-natives conversely pronunciations are unintuitive, depending on whether the language is constructed as spoken or as written first.\n\nAs you don’t dare to move the pages to the correct spelling which you find no attestations of. You may move though and slap {{normalized}} on it, since you can’t argue either that anyone is organically more likely to find the cited spelling, and this is perfectly in accordance with the formal inclusion criteria by reason that, as said on other places, you can even add words which aren’t attested in writing at all but in audio, where you choose your own spelling. Remember, descriptivism is also describing the normative forms, which authors could have adhered to but failed to adhere to in their attempts. Like an attempt is also a full-fledged crime. Fay Freak (talk)\n\n@-sche: The one quote in the entry is an obvious error for xerophilic. I think Doremitzwr let his enthusiasm for Ancient Greek get away from him. Anyone else would have realized it made no sense, instead of rummaging through lexica for anything that fit the spelling and making up a definition to match it. Chuck Entz (talk)\n\nAha! I'll RFV it and we can presumably delete it in a month (or sooner if anyone wants to be bold). - -sche (discuss)\n\nIs this really a proverb? Sounds more like a catchphrase. Compare violence sells, blood sells (\"blood sells. The bloody version of Mortal Kombat sold seven times better than the bloodless version\"). PUC –\n\nI'd say it technically meets the definition of proverb in most dictionaries, although people are unlikely to refer to it as such because they associate the word with more traditional sayings. People mostly seem to call it a saying, adage or maxim according to Google, but those aren't used as headings on Wiktionary. A catchphrase to me is usually from popular culture and associated with a particular person or character, so I wouldn't use that word. Weylaway (talk)\n\nThe pronunciation of dargah is given as /ˈdʊəɡɑː/. However, the Indian English pronunciation is closer to /dəɹɡɑː/. Sbb1413 (he) (talk • contribs)\n\nWow, the error was uncaught since the entry's creation back in 2012. Dictionary.com has (for non-rhotic accents) /ˈdɜːɡɑː/, but that pronunciation may correspond better to the spelling durgah. I've removed /ˈdʊəɡɑː/ in any case. - -sche (discuss)\n\nThank you. The spelling \"dargah\" is more common than \"durgah\" despite the pronunciation, because the pronunciation in Dictionary.com corresponds to the Indian English pronunciation (at least in my accent) /dəɹɡɑː/, which in turn corresponds to Hindi दरगाह (dargāh). --Sbb1413 (he) (talk • contribs)\n\nIs the definition accurate (and appropriate) ? <<opposed to multiculturalism and egalitarianism by race and sex>> & <<often supportive of anti-Semitism, Islamophobia, homophobia, transphobia, white nationalism and white supremacy>> really ? Is this correct, or is this just what the alt-left assumes it is ? These are clear misinterpretations.\n\nWhen compared to the definition of alt-left the difference is striking, and smacks of extreme bias.\n\nIt would be as if the alt-left were defined as <<opposed to national sovereignty and human rights>> & <<often supportive of Christianophobia, child mutilation, paedophilia, crime and corruption, elitism, fascism, globalism, hypocricy and anti-white racism>>. Can we make alt-right neutral ? As neutral as alt-left is ? Leasnam (talk)\n\nI mean one can add random stuff there like “typically supporting the Putin regime” and “using rare slurs towards other races” and then one will similarly come here to make a long argument why this isn’t accurately depicting the definition but at most a statistical distribution. You are right in your observation. This consideration should alert us. The nyms are random. Declaring neo-reactionary a synonym is ridiculous, neither is alt-right far right, just to some degree tilting and, most importantly coquetting into that direction, otherwise one could just call it far right and there would be nothing new.\n\nThat being said I know not exactly what it means, but it does not mean what is depicted on the entry page and I may give up on such terms, particularly American ones, always spearheaded and consequentially edited by those who, possibly fifteen years of age, have the least education about what fundamental isms mean, that in the US are projected upon a two-party system, becoming one of the least accurate map projections of thinking to reality. One must be fifteen and occupied by some dubious political organization to outline such terms unpaid, isn’t it? It is often true that the youths endanger each other. Many people stay at that age-typical intellectual development in political preferences, personality development supposedly finished, though identity could be a more spurious idea than ever. And if not, if one understands how people’s minds work, then, as the Dunning-Kruger effect vanishes, it is a challenging question to formulate what one understands, so more primitive people can get a grasp of your ideology. Everyone is telling lies in politics to promote a point of view, sadly necessary for simplification, and how publishing to not perish works in academia and journalists, exemplarily.\n\nHowever this tirade of catchwords is also vastly redundant, rather than simplified. “supportive of anti-Semitism, Islamophobia, homophobia, transphobia, white nationalism and white supremacy” is sufficiently covered by “opposed to multiculturalism and egalitarianism by race and sex”. This tendency of thinking marks right-wing views, resulting in those phenomena. No doubt about this because apart from ctrl-left sociologists, whom you trust not, there is intelligence gathering by neutral authorities in this matter, bound to define what they control. The interesting part for alt-right here is “sometimes claimed to be ironic”. I think this is the core of the matter. The demeanour is ironic. Alt-right is a literary genre. The “translations” into other languages are of course translationese. This alleged ideology works only in a baiting context of a language and at most culturally related languages. Say, what is a Chinese alt-right? You see.\n\nTo speak of “amorphous group” is also wise because it takes two to tango: You are alt-right because your friends, by family-resemblance, are alt-right. I can post as many Hitler portraits and Nazi music and argue the points of his party as I like, I will still not be a Nazi, because I mix my private ideology, like private language, only accessible to the choicest; would only be schizoid, it would be nice masking. Ideologies are also where one “fits in” socially. Allists are designed to lose internal identity, or symbiotize it with a mass. As said on other places, they are repulsed by logical stances, instead they need framing, so everything dovetails within their Dunbar number. There arises a scheme to microdose outrageous propositions, thus one does business with supposedly ideologically novel publications. Not saying they don’t have just fun either to “own the libs”. But it is a continuing language game. Politics seems like a videogame addiction for many. And hate sells. Most are bare needy for it, left or right, as for sex, for but the most privileged can always avoid being annoyed even theoretically. Fay Freak (talk)\n\nWe could define it more concisely like Wikipedia does, \"a far-right, white nationalist movement\". \"White nationalist\" is definitional (the movement's main notable activities have been white nationalist rallies), but many of the other items in the \"often supportive of...\" list, while not per se incorrect, are maybe not vital / definitional — it does not seem like the alt-right contrasts with some other far-right movement by being \"often supportive of [...] Islamophobia, homophobia, transphobia\" where the other one is not. (Whereas, the white nationalism and organizing Nazi rallies is relatively distinguishing/definitional, even if they aren't the only far-right movement doing it.) Dictionary.com defines it as \"a political movement originating on social media and online forums, composed of a segment of conservatives who support extreme right-wing ideologies, including white nationalism and antisemitism (often used attributively).\" Merriam-Webster has \"a right-wing, primarily online political movement or grouping based in the U.S. whose members reject mainstream conservative politics and espouse extremist beliefs and policies typically centered on ideas of white nationalism.\" - -sche (discuss)\n\nRemoved everything after \"Internet\", as well as \"neo-reactionary\" as a syn, per Fay Freak. I feel like \"far-right\" is related to \"alt-right\", and I may edit further to indicate this. CitationsFreak (talk)\n\nThank you, it looks much better. Leasnam (talk)\n\nWe have this defined as a plural of xylograph (and give cites of it there), but is that right? It seems more like a separate word, formed with -ica (“a collection of things”); indeed, one of the cites refers to \"These block-books, or xylographica\". - -sche (discuss)\n\nDone Fixed. Equinox ◑\n\nThanks! - -sche (discuss)\n\nSee this search for 16 terms that are in Category:English sequence adverbs that bear the label {{lb|en|sequence}}. Some 35 members of the category do not have that label.\n\nIt seems to me that raising the academic notion of \"frequency adverb\" to the level of a definition label seems likely to be confusing, especially without any link to an explanation. I have added similar labels (eg, degree) to other adverbs, but I now wonder whether they are more confusing than helpful. Even a link to an explanation or to the category directly from the label doesn't seem likely to be very helpful. This kind of label is what I would expect only in a learner's dictionary where the user can be expected to know how to interpret such things, but not in a general native speaker's dictionary. How can we address the needs of both types of users, both when unregistered and when registered? DCDuring (talk)\n\nDiscussion moved from User talk:Sgconlaw.\n\nI've received the following request from WF: \"Hey. Can you undelete this page? Equinox deleted it in a fit of anti-Wonderfool frustration a few years back, although it was good shit P. Sovjunk (talk) \"\n\nThe definition was \"to the bone (completely)\". However, I don't speak Spanish so I thought it was better to ask here whether the term is idiomatic or merely sum-of-parts. — Sgconlaw (talk)\n\nVale, I'll just make it again. Sorry for wasting your time P. Sovjunk (talk)\n\n@P. Sovjunk: no worries. I’m just not in a position to properly judge this entry. — Sgconlaw (talk)\n\nWhich \"right\" do right eigenvector and right eigenvalue come from? Is it because they are on the right hand side of an equation, or that they are correct??? P. Sovjunk (talk)\n\nProbably this: Left and right (algebra). Equinox ◑\n\nYep. Seeing as we have left eigenvalue, I could have figured it out myself. I kinda feel a bit stupid P. Sovjunk (talk)\n\nI thought this and roentgenizdat would have the same meaning, but they don't. Should they be aligned in some way? Equinox ◑\n\nThe Russian term is probably wrong, per etym. (X-ray + publishing house makes sense for the bone records, not the typical Flexi-Disc, plus a bone record sounds like it could be under the subset of \"Flexi-Disc.\") CitationsFreak (talk)\n\nDone Appears to have been corrected now. Thanks. Equinox ◑\n\nThe etymology claims that the source(s) are a doublet, but do not make it clear which terms comprise the notional doublet, nor why they are a doublet, as they all seem to hark eventually from the Latin bis + coctus; sounds to me more like cognate than doublet. JonRichfield (talk)\n\nIt claims that English biscotti is a doublet of English biscuit, which it is. Doublets are different terms in the same language from the same etymological source (generally derived via different routes) so all words in the same language that are cognates of each other are also doublets. Or did you overlook the fact that it linked to English biscotti and not Italian biscotti? Chuck Entz (talk)\n\nOK, but the topic is so arbitrary and tortuous that I think we should include a link to Doublet (linguistics), since no adequate definition is likely to fit into a dictionary entry.JonRichfield (talk)\n\nWe could do that, but our usual practice is to link to the much shorter definitions in our glossary for the sake of readers who may flinch at being presented with such a long Wikipedia article. I suppose for some words we could link to the glossary, and then from the glossary link to Wikipedia if we feel some readers might want more details. —Soap—\n\nWe do that already for some terms. Appendix:Glossary#areal feature links to Wikipedia’s Areal feature. Appendix:Glossary#aspect links to Wikipedia’s Grammatical aspect. And so on. --Lambiam\n\nWhat sense of big is used in \"big mad\", , , etc? - -sche (discuss)\n\n“In a large amount or to a large extent.” Adjective POS apparently “Important or significant,” thus about replaceable by “significantly”. Fay Freak (talk)\n\nI'd have the same def., but degree adverb modifying adjective. DCDuring (talk)\n\nI posted this last month on the information desk and didn't get any response, so I'll repost here and see if anyone could help.\n\nThis concerns some words used in songs from Argentine Yiddish singer Jevel Katz. In particular, פּאַגאַריי (pagarey), כערענטע (kherente) and קוניעלע (kunyele) found in the song A tragedye fun a pagarey. Should I add these to Wiktionary even though I'm not sure whether anyone outside of Katz uses/used those terms? Although כערענטע (kherente) is probably just an ad-hoc borrowing from Spanish gerente and nothing systematic. Insaneguy1083 (talk)\n\nYou could exercise editorial discretion to not bother spending time to add things that don't seem to really belong to the Yiddish language rather than to Katz's personal idiolect. I don't think there's anything in policy that would stop someone else from coming along and adding them, though, unless they are mere code-switching (like we wouldn't include the English words from the Wise Guys' song \"Denglisch\" as ==German==). We have some terms in various languages with labels or usage notes indicating that they're specific to someone's philosophy or that they're someone's nonces; I suppose you could add these and flag them as nonces, as the most future-proof option (against someone else just adding them with no indication of nonceness). - -sche (discuss)\n\nInstead of an ad-hoc borrowing, the use of כערענטע could just be code-switching, like seen here for English. --Lambiam\n\nThe Ottoman Turkish quote mentions a Canadian man whose name appears transliterated as \"Jozef Gadbory\", what English surname matches it better, my guess would be Gadberry, but it can't be due to phonological reasons.

Also, some columns in the tables are not correct ... for example, the participial in the STATIVE tables ... as well as certain statives themselves, such as '-jabule' - which would 'normally' be '-jabulile' - jabule MAY be correct (for example dialectically) for all I know!

The only definition of 'tai' in English is a Japanese loan word for Japanese bream (a fish). The concept of 'tai chi' (spiritual excercise routine) has no semantic connection to the Japanese fish. So: what is the relationship between tai and tai chi? (Note: I do not immediately believe this meets the requirement of Wiktionary:Semantic_relations#Otherwise_related. This kind of thing is seen elsewhere (as at [2] Han-tan & Mu-tan-chiang, [3] Fo-chan and elsewhere).) --Geographyinitiative (talk)\n\nThere's absolutely no relationship apart from the obvious one tat both contain the word \"tai\". Loads of similar links have recently been added by Wonderfools. If there are any that editors disagree with it, and feel like removing the link, Wonderfool (at least the current version of WF) is not bothered. P. Sovjunk (talk)\n\nI'm on the fence. On one hand, they're not etymologically or semantically related; on the other hand, they're not claimed to be (they're not listed in \"Related terms\", nor \"Synonyms\" or \"Coordinate terms\" or the like). And the criteria for listing something as a \"see also\" are murky but — since I not infrequently see e.g. terms where the spelling is similar enough to be confusable crosslinked via ==See also== — certainly seem to extend beyond what's listed in WT:NYMS, which is...what? it's not even labelled as a guideline, I'm guessing it's just an (incomplete) explanatory page? \"If you encountered and are looking up the word tai, be sure it's not part of one of these longer multi-word [multiple space-separated part] terms which have separate entries\" could be a useful reason to see-also-link something, but it's also not something we do consistently: perhaps we should try to decide whether or not to do that in general, not only specifically in this case. - -sche (discuss)\n\nI feel that completely unrelated or very distantly related words shouldn’t be shoehorned into the “See also” section simply because they are superficially identical or similar. This is misleading and unhelpful to readers. It’s like putting widow in the entry window. — Sgconlaw (talk)\n\nThey take up very little screen space, so I approve of connections like this. Somtimes we add a qualifier label (etymologically unrelated) to either one specific term or a whole group, though in this case I wouldnt think too many people, even English language learners, would connect tai chi with the fish. —Soap—\n\nYeah, the etymologically unrelated tag is something Wonderfool started. The wording was very deliberate. WF was gonna make a crappy template too, but meh... P.

It's just yogurt, isn't it? Equinox ◑\n\nI doubt it, but I could see you being right. Probably a copy+paste job from a public-domain dictionary, if it is. CitationsFreak (talk)\n\nI get the sense no-one is sure. The 1933 OED has this as \"Yaourt (ya·ɹt). Also yao(o)rt, you(a)rt. [Turkish [...] yōghurt (with quiescent gh) YOGHURT.] A fermented liquor made by the Turks from milk.\" In contrast, it has various spellings of yogurt, like yoghourt and yoghurd, explicitly defined as yogurt (which it defines as \"A sour fermented liquor made from milk, used in Turkey and other countries of the Levant\"); it doesn't list yaourt among the many alternative spellings of yogurt. Either the editors thought yaourt and yogurt were different, or they were not confident that they were the same. I've yet to find anything conclusively saying they are or aren't the same, but searching is hampered, as I'm sure you also found, by the fact that it's also a French word. - -sche (discuss)\n\nGiven that the French word means yoghurt and our etymology claims the word is borrowed from the French, is there really any good reason to think that English yaourt means something else? Andrew Sheedy (talk)\n\nThe use of an obsolete sense of liquor in the definition strongly suggests that it is lifted from an old dictionary, probably indeed the 1933 OED or its precursor, A New English Dictionary on Historical Principles, whose definition is identical. The Century Dictionary has, “[< Turk. yoghurt.] A kind of thickened fermented liquor made by the Turks of milk curdled in a special way.”. This dictionary has no entry for yoghurt or yogurt, while A New English Dictionary on Historical Principles, after writing, “See also Yaourt”, defines yogurt as, “A sour fermented liquor made from milk, used in Turkey and other countries of the Levant.”. The name yoghurt only took off in the 20th century, while yaourt fell in disuse.[7] So yaourt is clearly an obsolete name for yoghurt. --Lambiam\n\nDone Christ, I am tired. Okay, I turned it into \"obsolete form of yogurt\". There are loads of linked and related terms but I'm sure the clueless, literature-uninterested philistine Wonderfool will fix them up.

A reference needs to be added.\n\nSee also the same here https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/dort -> There you also have the -ɔːt even though I believe it's not correct.\n\nIn my opinion, the standard pronunciation is [dɔʁt], with [dɔɐ̯t] being arguably more common and just as correct/just as legitimate. The latter sounds more modern, the former more old-fashioned. See also Art: https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/Art\n\n[ʔaːʁt], [ʔaːɐ̯t], [ʔaːt] Here, ʔaːt is indeed correct as a third option because a long \"a\" plus an a-schwa, vs just a long a, is virtually indistinquishable.

Fay Freak (talk)\n\n@Fay Freak The pronunciation [ɔː] for word-internal /ɔr/ is in fact not just common, but likely the most common realisation in contemporary German. You also hear the corresponding monophthongizations [ɛː], [œː] for /ɛr/, /œr/, but these are admittedly much rarer. — If you need a source, I suggest one you can find on Google Books: Pracht, Henrike: Schemabasierte Basisalphabetisierung im Deutschen. Ein Praxisbuch für Lehrkräfte, Waxmann Verlag, p. 67. The author gives the examples [mɔːɡən], [fɔːnə] for \"morgen\", \"vorne\". You can also listen to the Audio here at \"Zorn\" for a clear example. — I'm going to reinstate the transcriptions you deleted. 88.64.225.53\n\nI can imagine these pronunciation, and people without phonological erudition would hardly notice anything odd when one uses them so they must be used by some, but nope, it is just lazily spoken or heard, also by the IP who added it to dort and claimed the speaker used it, who clearly said [ɔʁ], and not plausibly “the most common realization in contemporary German”, where even [äɐ̯] in the whole region of Eastern Westphalia-Lippe is distinguished consistently, and thus appears on the graphs of Praat when linguistics students of the Bielefeld University take their phonetics courses. I am also a person who thinks we should not give [eː] variants for [ɛː] even if widespread. You are like those Soviet linguistics who contended the letter ъ should be abolished because the distinction is documented to have merged with that expressed by ь—a circumstance I have neither ever experienced in practice. Holier-than-thou language teaching. Of course I will not add such things not known first-hand, whatever some pedagogues claim to be common (dictionary-only pronunciations). Fay Freak (talk)\n\n@Fay Freak What's the point. -- You and your fellow East Westphalians may distinguish [aɐ̯] from [a:] replace : with ː, invalid IPA characters (:), and that's great. But I certainly don't and neither do millions of Germans. (And in this case we really don't have to argue about it.) In the same way nobody doubts that there are people who say [ɔɐ̯]. But very many others say [ɔ:] replace : with ː, invalid IPA characters (:) (word-internally, usually not finally), and that's not \"lazily spoken\", much less \"lazily heard\". It is a variant, a common variant and therefore mentionable. The asker wanted a source, I gave him one. (What I will take back is the \"likely\" in \"likely the most common realization\" above. I'll replace it with \"in my opinion\", because I firmly believe it is, but may not have sufficient data to prove it.) 88.64.225.53\n\nOne of the senses given for the adjective sick is “In bad taste”, as in sick joke. Which sense of taste is this? --Lambiam\n\nI'd say sense 4. Vininn126 (talk)\n\nA good definition should allow substitution. For example, “The writing in this manual is very esoteric” → “The writing in this manual is likely to be understood by only a very small number of people with a specialized knowledge”. Or, “Their top hitman, Joe Russo, was on the lam after murdering Joe Barboza in San Francisco” → “Their top hitman, Joe Russo, was running away from the police after murdering Joe Barboza in San Francisco”. What can we do with “Vegan jokes are in bad taste”,[8] using the definition for sense 4? Rewrite the sentence as “Vegan jokes are in someone's bad implicit set of preferences”? That is likely to be understood by only a very small number of people. --Lambiam\n\nHmm. Good catch. MWOnline and 2 idioms dictionaries (@OneLook) consider in bad taste an idiom. Similar to to one's taste which should be at to someone's taste. DCDuring (talk)\n\nI have added the lemma in bad taste. --Lambiam\n\n@Lambiam, DCDuring: Not sure this is the right move, as there are quite a few alternatives: in poor taste, in dubious taste, in debatable taste, in awful taste, in horrible taste, in good taste, in excellent taste… PUC –\n\nI wonder whether not in good taste doesn't occur more often than in good taste alone. DCDuring (talk)\n\nEvidently other lexicographic references find it worth including. We have lots of idioms for which synonyms can be substituted. I would be perfectly happy, no, eager to entertain definitions of taste that were substitutable in this expression and its antonyms and synonyms. I wouldn't bother looking at MWOnline since they gave up and include the expression as a whole. DCDuring (talk)\n\nWhat about seeing it as a synonym of judgment? Is in bad judgment a conceivable expression in English? PUC –\n\nNot in my idiolect. DCDuring (talk)\n\nIt may be that we need our definitions to be less subjectivist/relativist and more objectivist/absolute (at least allowing the notion of consensus social values). Also, as I think it may be difficult for anyone here to come up with a substitutable, yet intelligible-to-normal-humans, definition, we may have to settle for a suitable non-gloss definition. DCDuring (talk)\n\nI'm wondering whether French faute de goût, literally “mistake of taste”, could not be translated as \"lapse in judgment\". If yes, I think it would be further confirmation that \"taste\" and \"judgment\" are semantically quite close. PUC –\n\nPerhaps, but not substitutable in this expression. DCDuring (talk)\n\nBoth definitions 4 and 5 refer to personal preference. Prefer implies positive liking and def. 5 expicitly shows that. That is one reason why in bad judgment doesn't work. In fact, bad judgment refers to defective judgment, not a defect in what is judged. In addition, in bad taste implies that a reference group would share the perception or judgment, so the word personal used in both definitions is inappropriate. Perhaps taste in this sense would be \"conformity to a social norm (of a reference group).\" Not many dictionaries have such a definition, but Collins has \"judgment or aesthetic or social matters according to a generally accepted standard\". This definition is not substitutable in \"bad taste\". DCDuring (talk)\n\nThe OED's definition III.8.b. might be what is sought here. I feel it's nearly synonymous with our sense 3 of fashion, which is \"A style or manner in which something is done.\" The OED gives rather dated quotations such as \"in the same Taste\", \"in the taste of the last century\", \"in the Moorish taste\", and, critically, \"nothing could be [...] in better taste\", which matches the idiomatic usage as discussed by @PUC above.

There is also one man’s fish is another man’s poisson, a pun that only succeeds because “one man’s meat is another man’s poison” is an established saying. --Lambiam\n\nI think snowclone slots can be (and probably have to be) somewhat restricted.

Examples available on request. Quercus solaris (talk)\n\nWhat is the practical difference? The former is defined as \"English terms related to sexual intercourse or sexuality\" and the latter is defined merely as \"English terms related to sexuality\". Category:Sexuality is a subcategory of Category:Sex, but definition 1 of sexuality is \"the quality of being sexual; that which is characterized or distinguished by sex\", which doesn't help clarify what the difference is. There is a lot of overlap, e.g. Category:Prostitution is a direct child of both. I kind of get it, e.g. Category:Sexual orientations and Category:LGBT are under Category:Sexuality, and so are Category:Paraphilias and Category:BDSM, but the actual line seems very blurry, as evidenced by the terms found directly under one or another category. I also think we need some serious updating of the definitions of some terms, e.g. the definition of paraphilia uses terms like \"abnormal\" and \"pathological\" that AFAIK represent an outdated conception of what a paraphilia is, and definition 5 under sexuality is \"sexual identity, gender\" which seems rather vague at the very least. Can someone help clarify the category definitions and subcategory membership? Benwing2 (talk)\n\nI feel that “Sex” is not a useful name because it’s ambiguous—it could refer to gender or sexual differences, or to sexual behaviour. Also, the hierarchy Reproduction > Sex > Sexuality isn’t ideal as not all sexual behaviour relates to reproduction. Perhaps “Sex” should be renamed “Gender and sex”, and both it and “Sexuality” made direct subcategories of “Life”. — Sgconlaw (talk)\n\nWe have CAT:Gender already (no objection to renaming that one \"gender and sex\"). I agree \"sex\" is a terribly ambiguous name. Given that the current CAT:Sex defines itself as being for \"terms related to sexual intercourse or sexuality\", and we already have a CAT:Sexuality ... if we move all sexuality terms to CAT:Sexuality, will there be any \"terms related to sexual intercourse\" left that can't go in CAT:Sexuality? If so, could we create CAT:Sexual intercourse, and then eliminate CAT:Sex? - -sche (discuss)\n\nI agree with everything here. AG202 (talk)\n\nI don't think \"sex\" is very ambiguous. All ambiguity derives from the description on the category page \"terms related to sexual intercourse or sexuality\" instead of \"terms related to the sex act\" and its placement at the bottom of the topical category tree as opposed to under CAT:Sexuality. In my view \"sexual intercourse\" is more ambiguous because people disagree over whether it pertains to all sex acts. Maybe \"sexual relations\" would work, but \"sex\" is just much simpler. —Caoimhin ceallach (talk)\n\nI mean, the current content of the category being a mix of not only terms relating to intercourse and sexuality but also some gender-sex terms (which nothing in the category description would suggest including) proves that the ambiguity is in the name, not in the description which people don't even see when adding the category to pages. Any ambiguity in the scope of \"sexual intercourse\" is also present in the corresponding sense of \"sex\", hence all the debates in society (especially among teens or the religious) over whether something counts as sex, so \"sex\" offers no advantages, only equal ambiguity in that regard and greater ambiguity overall. - -sche (discuss)\n\nIt only proves that if you assume editors add words to categories without looking at them first. Now, I can't vouch for others, but I look at the both the topic tree and the topic description before adding a word, both of which in this case suggest CAT:Sex is a catch-all category for everything \"related to sexual intercourse or sexuality\".\n\nWiktionary at least seems to agree with my intuition: sex is \"Sexual activity, usually sexual intercourse\", while sexual intercourse is primarily \"Coitus or genital-genital sexual contact.\" The same goes for Merriam-Webster and Oxford Dictionary of English.\n\nLastly, the simplicity of \"sex\" over something longer shouldn't be discounted. —Caoimhin ceallach (talk)\n\n@Caoimhin ceallach: mmmm, we can’t ignore the fact that all the dictionaries note that sex has multiple senses. For example, Merriam-Webster lists as the first sense “either of the two major forms of individuals that occur in many species and that are distinguished respectively as female or male especially on the basis of their reproductive organs and structures”, and “sexual intercourse” is sense 2b. The equivalent sense numbers in Wiktionary are senses 1 and 6. — Sgconlaw (talk)\n\nI think when people talk about sex, they mean, well, sex. I would argue that the other meanings of sex are largely vestigial. They've mostly been superceded by gender. What remains is the fairly technical meaning \"gender, but based solely on physical characteristics\". (Side note: I think our entry sex used the OED as a template, which orders meanings chronologically. But we're not supposed to do that: WT:STYLE#Definition_sequence.) —Caoimhin ceallach (talk)\n\nI think it should be hierarchized vice-versa, and some categories now under Sex rather be under Sexuality. Like there are activities presupposing sexuality (a certain disposition that can merely express itself in ideations or fashion choices or whatever: the five senses at our entry sexuality are hardly conceptual reality), particularly sex, while pornography and erotic literature, genres, are not sex, and Incel community is also its negation and emphasizes community, while Seduction community is not necessarily directed at having sex but romantic relationships (?). Can’t rename Sex to gender and sex since, as it appears, it means sexual activity. Gender stuff can then by under sexuality, as people surely attempt to match it (stressing also that the term “gender” expresses an abstraction that did not catch on before the later 20th century), while reproduction should be under sex, as Sgconlaw rightly observed. Overall the categories are not too wrong, their definitions though … Fay Freak (talk)\n\nI think we should do away with the name \"Sex\" altogether because it's just inherently vague. Perhaps, as @-sche suggests, rename \"Gender\" as \"Gender and sex\", and move content relating to sexual intercourse and sexuality (but not specifically to gender and sex) to \"Sexuality\". Create \"Sexual intercourse\" only if we really feel that we need to differentiate sexual intercourse from sexuality. As for categorization, I would suggest \"Life > Sexuality > Gender and sex\", and (if really required) \"Life > Reproduction > Sexual intercourse\". — Sgconlaw (talk)\n\nNo, it’s not vague: It means sexual activity, sexual acts, and I actually already said this. There is a slew of criminal law defined around such acts (cross-linguistically), sex and the law, the relevant statutes are based upon the concept, and most people, in most contexts and as their first idea, see it as some kind of activity, not those meanings of longer history. Lucky that we have thus short a name in English. You can of course rename it to one of the longer terms in order to distinguish it from the other meanings of the word, but the other meanings are hardly read into it in the context of a dictionary category. The formulation you propose is possible but somewhat peripheral to the likely meanings of the words, not to say idiosyncratic, apart from unnecessarily “turning around” the usage previous editors have exposed, which is quite problematic: Someone comes back and then the categories have the reverse purpose. Fay Freak (talk)\n\n@Fay Freak: it's not useful as a category name because it can either mean (among other senses; see the entry) \"a category into which sexually-reproducing organisms are divided on the basis of their reproductive roles in their species; the distinction and relation between these categories, especially in humans; gender\", or \"sexual activity, usually sexual intercourse unless preceded by a modifier\". Category names should be as unambiguous as possible to avoid confusion. — Sgconlaw (talk)\n\nI do think there should be a category pertaining to the sex act and I think the most obvious name of such a category is Sex.\n\nAs an aside, it would be a good idea if the category page headers contained a few words explaining what the category is and is not about. This would dispel a lot of the ambiguities that come with them. —Caoimhin ceallach (talk)\n\n@Caoimhin ceallach: usage notes can (and should in some cases) be added to category pages, but bear in mind that many editors will not visit the category pages to read them. Thus, potentially ambiguous names should be avoided. — Sgconlaw (talk)\n\nI think we would be better off having subcategories in the format \"Sexual xyz\", where \"xyz\" can be things like \"identity\", \"activity\", etc. I'm not sure what they should be subcategories of, but at least it will give us the ability to be specific and clear. Chuck Entz (talk)\n\n@Sgconlaw @Caoimhin ceallach I want to hard oppose any category with the term sexual intercourse: it’s awkward and old-fashioned, frequently used in a hyperformal way that is reminiscent of some of the more tongue-in-cheek entries we often see at Urban Dictionary, and - most importantly - is probably too narrow in scope (since it doesn’t cover many peripheral aspects of sex). I agree with @Chuck Entz, and would support sexual activity. It’s general enough, without having the issue of being ambiguous. Theknightwho (talk)\n\n@Theknightwho: \"sexual activity\" seems fine to me. I did query in an earlier post as to whether it was necessary at all to have a separate category for \"sexual intercourse\", and suggested that if it was it should be a subcategory of \"Reproduction\". In other words, it would be restricted to use for categorizing biological terms. Maybe a better term for that would be \"Sexual reproduction\" (as opposed to \"Asexual reproduction\"). But, again, maybe its unnecessary to have such a narrow category, and terms relating to both sexual and asexual reproduction can just be placed in \"Reproduction\". — Sgconlaw (talk)\n\n(but not war hero)\n\nI stumbled onto these while fixing misspellings (war-hero was defined as \"Alternate form of: warhero\"). They were created by a sock of Luciferwildcat/GTroy. In typical fashion, the definition is rather lame, the choice of lemma is rather confused (I think he was afraid the obvious lemma, \"war hero\" would be deleted as SOP), and it seems to have been created solely to use in another dubious entry (Alchisay- name of an individual with no figurative meaning, and obviously created to make a political point). No brain cells were harmed in the creation of these entries.\n\nI'm not quite sure what to do about them: if any of these should exist in the first place (are there any uses of \"warhero\" that aren't typos, scannos or dummy names for something else? Is \"war hero\" SOP?), the formatting is rather primitive and the definition(s) need help. Chuck Entz (talk)\n\nI think they are all typos. As here in page 9a the printing looks bizarre. As often, amongst other editors in the past, it is an excuse to create an entry somebody was inept to argue for as idiomatic. Particularly since, if you are already banned, you want people to pay as little attention to you as feasible, rather than make them think. No less, war hero seems a word enough for me to include, like rock star and track star, also from a comparative perspective. Fay Freak (talk)\n\nThe typography looks fine to me, in that issue. (But I can't find the term \"war hero\", in any spelling anywhere.) CitationsFreak (talk)\n\nAre you referring to a specific definition? Because the phrase \"war hero\" is extremely common, including in the titles of a number of books. Google books has almost a million hits for \"war hero\" and \"war heroes\". Leaving aside SOP issues, it would probably pass on \"clear, widespread use\". As I said, our definition is pretty lame and probably wrong for any spelling. Basically, a war hero is someone who has done something heroic in a war. Chuck Entz (talk)\n\nI meant in the provided text. CitationsFreak (talk)\n\nThat makes sense. I had a feeling I was missing something, because it's not like you to say something so obviously, outrageously wrong. Chuck Entz (talk)\n\nIndeed, I couldn't find the the phrase there at all, either.

CitationsFreak (talk)\n\n@CitationsFreak: Are you unacquainted with the practice of lexicography to divide columns of pages by letters? Page 9 is page 9a and page 9b.

Case in point that all such cases are misprintings. Fay Freak (talk)\n\nI have never heard of that practice. And, yeah, the spacing is weird. However, it feels weird to claim that every use is an error in some way.

(I'm sure it is very commonly used in the real world.)\n\nDefinition: the pretend age of a 50, 60, or 70-something who doesn't want to use their real age because they think it's too old.\n\nWiktionary allows quotes that have words that are under their definition, so including a quote by Jack Benny under this definition is something I think should be done. Any thoughts on the best wording for this definition?? Georgia guy (talk)\n\nI am not sure this is idiomatic. — Sgconlaw (talk)\n\nI guess it is right to assume that it is not. It would be another entry to our chain of merely contextually loaded numbers: → Talk:neunstündig, Talk:77 times, Talk:quater, Talk:8:46. If you got enough of them, you might write a paper. Fay Freak (talk)\n\n@Georgia guy It strikes me as a concept rather than a lexical item. In other words, it's 39 rather than \"39\". It can be phrased in a number of ways in a variety of contexts. In the same way, the freezing point of pure water at a standard pressure is 32° Fahrenheit/0° Celsius. That's a fact- a very important one. It's not, however, a part of the language- you wouldn't have a dictionary entry for *0°. Chuck Entz (talk)\n\nIn my experience, I've never heard 39 used this way, but I have heard 18, 20, 25, 30, \"20 for the 40th time\" and all sorts of other combinations, which suggests to me that \"39\" simply happens to be more common in your circles than the other numbers, but not that there's anything special about it. Andrew Sheedy (talk)\n\nWhat sense of immune is used in immune system? PUC –\n\n@PUC: one that we don’t have yet. OED has “Of or relating to the phenomena of and processes involved in immunity”. — Sgconlaw (talk)\n\nI'm not sure that's a separate sense from our sense 4. - -sche (discuss)\n\n@-sche, Sgconlaw: Not sure either, but then our sense 4 has to be reworded, otherwise it would make the definition of immune system circular. PUC –\n\nThe applicable sense of the adjective immune can be defined as “related to immunity”, in which the term immunity is used in the medical sense. Compare immune response. However, since our definition of immune system does not rely directly or indirectly on a definition for immune, there is no danger of a circularity. --Lambiam\n\nOther dictionaries that have an entry for this fall into two camps: those that have paragraph-long \"definitions\" and those that have very simplified definitions. The long definitions run the risk of being TLDRs for many users, IMHO. If only there were a way we could allow all users the option of finding a long definition and more without overtaxing or repelling some of them. That would mean some kind of mechanism to allow users to see much more elaborate content if they wanted. Preferrably no one here would need to develop and maintain such content. If only there were such a mechanism .... DCDuring (talk)\n\nDoes this term really mean \"Somebody who excels in or is swift in executing a discipline\"? From the cites presented, it seems to refer to running (as in track and field), and GB backs me up. CitationsFreak (talk)\n\n@CitationsFreak: Perhaps the origin. It was generalized and transferred manifold times, I would suppose. I started from poetic rap uses of course, not adding all quotes available, and figured my own definition, since no dictionary has it or in other words there were only uses but no mentions, save Urban Dictionary, surely written by children, who only abstracted inaccurate meanings from particular contexts and not your specific definition either. Fay Freak (talk)\n\n@Fay Freak: The first three cites are about people running (as in the movement). The last sense doesn't, but is probably a pun on \"running\". Urban Dict. has this sense ass well, see the April 2007 definition. CitationsFreak (talk)\n\n@CitationsFreak: I have looked at the occurrences again, two weeks after newly engaging with the word, and redefined, in a manner that should insure us, “Somebody who is swift or excels in athletic running or in an occupation likened to it.” Probably any sport typically associated with “track”. As track and field. That Reddit Post refers to Jesse Owens, who, we find out, “was was an [Afro-]American track and field athlete”. And possibly car races as well, while biking would be odd. An intransparent, questionable term, with all kinds of puns, hence we need a dictionary entry. Fay Freak (talk)\n\nThat is way better. CitationsFreak (talk)\n\nTwo totally different cocktails? Equinox ◑\n\nPer Wikipedia: \"White lady ... is a classic cocktail that is made with gin, cointreau or Triple Sec, fresh lemon juice and an optional egg white. [It] sometimes also includes additional ingredients, for example egg white, sugar, cream, or creme de menthe.\". I'm leaning towards yes. CitationsFreak (talk)\n\nI consider it entirely plausible there are totally unrelated homonymous cocktails. After all, the number of combinations adj + noun is bounded, while the number of cocktail recipes appears to be without bound. That having been said, I very much doubt that homonymous cocktails are orthographically distinguished by the capitalizations of their names. --Lambiam\n\nYeah, if separate senses can be attested, I doubt they are consistently distinguished by capitalization; here is an author who capitalizes the Cointreau cocktail, in this book (which establishes the ingredients of the cocktail) and in others (which are more use-like, vs this mention):\n\n2018 December 6, Tristan Stephenson, The Curious Bartender Volume II: The New Testament of Cocktails, Ryland Peters & Small, →ISBN:\n\n... drink called White Lady. Originally comprising two parts Cointreau to one part crème de menthe and one part lemon juice, the drink tasted like a bad throat lozenge and looked like that suspicious kind of swimming-pool water. It's a[…]\n\nHowever, I'm sceptical that these are conceived of as separate cocktails, as opposed to one cocktail with a slightly variable recipe: here someone calls for gin and triple sec (like our definition at White Lady), but says triple sec is interchangeable with Cointreau (which is, indeed, just a kind of triple sec) and calls for lemon (not lime) juice as well as egg white (like our definition at white lady):\n\n2020 October 1, Gilli Davies, Royal Welsh Cookbook, eBook Partnership, →ISBN, page 74:\n\n[…] To make that perfect White Lady, put 60ml of good gin into a cocktail shaker with 30ml of triple sec (or Cointreau) and 20ml of lemon juice. Add a large amount of ice and a dash of egg white. Shake vigorously[…]\n\nWikipedia also seems to consider it one cocktail with variable ingredients, as CitationsFreak points out. So it seems like there may just be one thing, \"a cocktail made of gin or creme de menthe, triple sec (such as Cointreau), and lemon or lime juice (and optionally egg white)\". - -sche (discuss)\n\nI have moved \"White Lady\" sense to \"white lady\", and reduced \"White Lady\" to an alt form. So that's a start. As discussed above, we probably still want to merge senses. I'm strictly not allowed spirits (last time I drank vodka I lost my house keys) so can't help in this case. Equinox ◑\n\nmerged CitationsFreak (talk)\n\nWe have mute h as the main entry, but Google NGram view suggests otherwise: [[17]] Leasnam (talk)\n\n@Leasnam I think you're comparing apples and oranges. Mute h mostly refers to the difference in French between initial h that allows liaison and initial h that doesn't. Silent h is rarely used for that, but is the main way to describe the initial h in words like English honest and honor where the letter is written, but not pronounced. By that definition, every initial h in French is silent, whether mute or not. Since far more English speakers are talking about English than about French, the references to silent h are far more numerous. I'm not sure there's an easy way to filter for just references to the phenomenon of h muet in French words. Chuck Entz (talk)\n\nI had a feeling that might be the case. If so, then English silent h probably needs its own stand-alone entry (?). Silent h is very common in English to refer to the h in hour, honest, etc. and is has a hit rate of 19,5 K in GBooks. Mute h only shows about 8 K hits. Leasnam (talk)\n\nI mostly edit on Wikipedia so I mostly don't know the policies here on Wiktionary. I also don't know where I should add this: here or WT:RFV.\n\nSome entries in the {{gender symbols}} template cite the source Signs & Symbols: Over 1,001 Visual Signs Explained, but Signs & Symbols doesn't support them.\n\nFor example, Wiktionary defines the symbol \"⚪︎\" U+26AA MEDIUM WHITE CIRCLE (which should be an outline of a circle, but Chrome shows it as a filled circle character/emoji) as \"asexual\" but Signs & Symbols says that it is a symbol either representing \"female/feminine\" or nonbinary people. Citing Signs & Symbols, Wiktionary also defines \"⯱\" U+2BF1 ERIS FORM TWO as \"trans-female\" and \" \" <no Unicode character> as \"trans-male\", but they are nowhere in Signs & Symbols.\n\nI don't know what should be done in these cases. Any help would be greatly appreciated. LightNightLights (talk)\n\nEris form two (and the total lack of use of it) was discussed a while ago at Wiktionary:Information desk/2023/September#Help_removing_unsourced_\"trans_woman_symbol\". Perhaps the best course of action is to RFV the questionable symbols and find out whether actual, real-world use exists, and then delete them if they're only sourced to one book's claims (mentions) or not even that. Update: I've RFVed the symbols. - -sche (discuss)\n\nI didn't know about that discussion. Other than that, thank you! LightNightLights (talk)\n\nWhy are there so many \"related\" terms at Portuguese égua? And how come none of them is cavalo? OweOwnAwe (talk)\n\n@OweOwnAwe. Wiktionary \"Related terms\" sections are for etymologically related terms, so those are technically correct (they are all from the same Proto-Indo-European root: *h₁éḱwos), while cavalo is completely unrelated. Still, including the descendant of an Ancient Greek name based on a compound including the related term, passed down through Latin and a Spanish ruler's name to the name of a country, and finally borrowed into Portuguese and suffixed to make it a demonym, is IMO a bit of a stretch. Chuck Entz (talk)\n\nOh, I get it. I actually thought \"related terms\" had more to do with the meaning of the word rather than its etymology, that's why it took me a while to find out why \"Filipe\" and \"Filipinas\" were there. Thanks for clarifying. OweOwnAwe (talk)\n\nYou're not the only one. It's a bit counter-intuitive, but it's a choice that was made early in Wiktionary's history and it's reflected in hundreds of thousands if not millions of entries, so we might as well be consistent. See WT:EL. Chuck Entz (talk)\n\nWhile we're at it, is \"égua\" used as an interjection really as vulgar/offensive as the terms we list as translations? If it's something more like \"holy cow\", then we need to fix that. Note that I've seen strongly vulgar/offensive English terms used to translate Portuguese exclamations or slang before, and I have a feeling they were added by someone who didn't have a good feel for the English terms. Andrew Sheedy (talk)\n\nApparently, there is milder vulgarity in Hebrew derived from Russian where the second word (or is it two words?) sounds like a really bad vulgarity in Russian.\n\nI heard it today on Belarusian opposition news talking about the Israeli knesset.\n\nA Russian vulgar phrase (not mild at all!) is (a more grammatical form) is (иди) к ёбаной ма́тери (k jóbanoj máteri), which is (go to) \"the fucked mother\", \"fuck off\", go to hell)\n\nI couldn't find a Hebrew spelling or a confirmation from reliable sources.\n\nIs the phrase spelled לך קיבינימט (lekh kibinimat) in Hebrew? Anatoli T. (обсудить/вклад)\n\nUpdate: the Hebrew Wiktionary has an article קיבינימט and it looks attestable.\n\nA less grammatically correct version of ёбаная мать (jóbanaja matʹ, “fucked mother(vulgar)”) are ебёна мать (jebjóna matʹ) or ёбана мать (jóbana matʹ), which are probably the source of the Hebrew word.\n\nThe ungrammatical form \"(иди) к ебе́ней ма́тери (k jebénej mátjeri)\" (\"(go to) the fucked mother\") also exists, which sounds closer to \"kibinimát\" but \"мать\" is indeclined in the Hebrew derivation.\n\nI will request an entry for קִיבִּינִימָט (kibinimát) Anatoli T. (обсудить/вклад)\n\nInviting @Taokailam, @Ruakh. Anatoli T. (обсудить/вклад)\n\nI consulted a native speaker and indeed, it is vulgar. Taokailam (talk)\n\nIt's pretty common phrase in Hebrew, and it is from Russian, but i have no clue what is the right way of spelling it. There is also a very similar phrase in Kazakh or Kyrgyz language, so it may be some reason of why the ending -eri is missing. Tollef Salemann (talk)\n\nThere appears to be an additional sense of dubia that means \"work of doubtful authorship\", as seen in w:Eubulus (poet), w:Annales (Ennius), etc. This arose at this discussion about the disambig page for dubia at Wikipedia. This books search turns up numerous references for this sense of dubia, and this page at \"Author Unknown\" (2014) by Don Foster contains a definition. If someone would like to expand dubia to add this sense, I'd appreciate it. Thanks, Mathglot (talk)\n\nIn the way it is used in Author Unknown it is the plural of dubium. Borrowing terms from Latin and Greek is not uncommon in textual scholarship, especially corpus linguistics (codex, hapax legomenon; editio princeps), typically with classically formed plurals (codices, hapax legomena; editiones principes). --Lambiam\n\nWhat Lambiam says. It does not mean but can mean “work of doubtful authorship”, depending on the context. This is to say it might merit an entry as an English word but only with a general definition. The rest of that discussion seems irrelevant to our lexicologic work. Fay Freak (talk)\n\nIndeed, the majority of scholarly uses I find refer to a passage in some old text raising a philosophical or theological question. Musical scholars appear to prefer the term opus dubium for works of uncertain ascription. --Lambiam\n\nwhether or not has been deleted here for being SoP. https://dictionary.cambridge.org/us/dictionary/english/whether-or-not says it's an idiom. Who's right? — Alexis Jazz (talk)\n\nIt is probably (marginally) an idiom, in the sense that the elision and alteration of truly transparent means of expressing the same thing are themselves not fully transparent to some. Taking the two examples from the link:\n\nWhether or not you like it, I’m going out tonight. ⇐ Whether you like it or do not (you) like it, ....\n\nWhether he wants to or not, he'll have to clean his room. ⇐ Whether he wants to or does not want to, ....\n\nTo a native speaker the transformation is more or less automatic, ie, part of grammar. Perhaps it is less so to a language learner, DCDuring (talk)\n\nArguably it was deleted out of process some 15 years ago, so it is good to review its exclusion now. DCDuring (talk)\n\nCommon or not, I don't know whether it can be considered an idiom if either half of the phrase can be omitted without a notable change in semantics. In my opinion, like it or not, it's just two words being used in their standard senses, regardless of whether they are paired together or standing alone. Qwertygiy (talk)\n\nOne can omit neither half of the phrase from whether or not you like it, I’m going out tonight, whatever these “halves” may be. --Lambiam\n\nTouché. I can't come up with a natural, proper substitute for either while keeping that construction. \"if'n or not\" is quite far from standard English, and that's as close as I can get without shuffling clauses around. Whether that means it is idiomatic when paired directly, or that it's subject to a broader rule of grammar, I can't say or not for certain. (See, that does sound a bit stilted to me. Maybe not to others. Maybe or not to others? Hm.) Qwertygiy (talk)\n\nCan brick up mean immure? PUC –\n\nBrick up is a troponym of immure, but brick in is a closer troponym. One can brick up a wall that doesn't enclose any thing, so to have pure troponymy one would need a narrow definition of brick up, possibly a subsense of a broader definition like \"(transitive) to erect a wall with respect to\". Perhaps one can brick up an embankment to make a retaining wall or brick up a building frame to make a wall of a structure. The two terms are in completely different registers: It's hard to imagine an RP pronunciation of brick up. DCDuring (talk)\n\n'The Sad Story of Henry' is a Thomas the Tank Engine story where the Fat Controller decided to 'brick up' Henry and it could certainly be read with an RP accent but on a more high-brow level, 'The Cask of Amontillado' by Edgar Allen Poe opts for 'brick in'. --Overlordnat1 (talk)\n\nAs an RP speaker, this is actually the first sense I think of when I hear the term out of context. I certainly wouldn't take brick up to mean \"erect\" (as in, \"brick up a wall\") - that sounds quite unnatural to me. Theknightwho (talk)\n\nSo, there is a common feature in Russian, characterized by the use of an em dash and lack of a verb like this:\n\nZ — a user in Wiktionary.\n\nWhat is the name of this feature? (if it has any) I ask because it also occurs in Tajiki and I wanted to know more about its usage in Tajiki. --Z\n\nAccording to Wikipedia, at Dash#In_other_languages, it's used as a stand-in for the present copula, is/are/am. I don't know if the practice has a particular name. Qwertygiy (talk)\n\nThe phenomenon is called zero copula. You can also search for the copula/\"to be\" being omitted or left out. Weylaway (talk)\n\nYeah, in my experience it's an optional way of indicating the zero copula (but this can also just be omitted entirely, without even a dash). - -sche (discuss)\n\n@ZxxZxxZ, @-sche, @Qwertygiy, @Weylaway:\n\nPlease see a note in —#Russian: In the standard Russian orthography \"—\" can be used as a copula in the sense \"A = B\" when both parts are noun in the present tense. Not used with pronouns, adjectives or in the past or future tenses. Anatoli T. (обсудить/вклад)\n\nThe Portuguese entry cravo has \"pimple\" as one of its meanings, making it a synonym of espinha. However, at least in Brazil, these are not synonyms: espinha means \"pimple\" and cravo means \"blackhead\". Since they are not considered synonyms by other dictionaries, I wonder if they're even used that way. OweOwnAwe (talk)\n\nI don't know if they're used the way Wiktionary lists them, but I can agree here: espinha and cravo aren't the same thing. MedK1 (talk)\n\nIs this a real pronunciation of Israel? In what accent? Added in diff. Merriam-Webster has, besides the main pronunciations we and most other dictionaries have (/ˈɪz.ɹi.əl/, /ˈɪz.ɹeɪ.əl/), also /ˈɪs-/ and /ˈiz.ɹəl/ (the latter of which I don't recall ever hearing), but no /-ɹɛəl/. - -sche (discuss)\n\nA disyllabic pronunciation that sounds like \"is\" + \"rail\" can be viewed as a \"compressed\" version of trisyllabic /ˈɪz.ɹeɪ.əl/ (or a version for speakers who have a general merger of /-ˈeɪl/ and /-ˈeɪəl/ as [ɛəl]). I'm pretty sure it exists. Actually, I would guess that a 'compressed' disyllabic [ˈɪz.ɹiəl] or [ˈɪz.ɹɪəl] (\"is-reel\") also exists, but not really as a phonemically distinct entity from [ˈɪz.ɹi.əl].--Urszag (talk)\n\nI'm not sure what the specific name of the accent would be, if it isn't considered simply \"American South\", but in the Carolinas, I believe /ˈɪz.ɹɛəl/ would be the accurate IPA of the way I've always heard Israel pronounced by 'average' speakers who are neither newscasters nor drawling. Although I can't directly attest to the existence of /ˈiz.ɹəl/, that is exactly how I would expect it to sound in the stronger Piedmont accent of central North Carolina, with Dale Earnhardt Jr. as a notable example. Qwertygiy (talk)\n\nWe should certainly have /ɪzˈɹeɪl/ listed as a pronunciation, this is in line with the pronunciation we give for Israeli (/ɪzˈɹeɪli/) after all. It's not just before an 'l' that such vowel reductions occur though of course, I say Ireland and island in the same way, both with 2 syllables and diamond is always di'mond for me too. --Overlordnat1 (talk)\n\nQuibble -- it would not be /ɪzˈɹeɪl/ as in /ɪzˈɹeɪli/ because the emphasis differs. Israel vs. Israeli. The exact vowels might differ, but I've never heard of a standard pronunciation that stressed the second syllable.\n\nIt would have to be /ˈɪz.ɹeɪl/. Qwertygiy (talk)\n\nAbsolutely, I just put the stress in the wrong place due to me lazily copy-pasting the pronunciation given in the Israeli article and not thinking about the stress mark. Overlordnat1 (talk)\n\nSo the entry for how often was deleted as sum-of-parts, but literal translations don't exist or aren't idiomatic (natural) in some languages. Can it be reconsidered as a THUB or maybe phrasebook entry? Drapetomanic (talk)\n\n@Felonia, Mglovesfun, msh210 Drapetomanic (talk)\n\nHow combines with almost any adjective phrase. \"How totally scrambled do you want your eggs?\" may not be attestable, but it is perfectly grammatical and understandable. No OneLook dictionary has an entry for it, not even WordNet, which seems to bend over backward to include expressions for a multilingual semantic net that is almost as much conceptual as lexicographic. DCDuring (talk)\n\nThere is Latin quotiens, Ancient Greek ποσάκις (posákis) and Uneapa vahaziva. Archaic Russian сколь (skolʹ), Armenian քանի (kʻani) and South Levantine Arabic قديش mean “how much” or “how many”, but can also be used for “how often”. This does not seem enough to merit a THUB. Do you know other examples? --Lambiam\n\nI think this is probably worth an entry, as it has a rather specialized meaning. If not, I think we should check if there are enough words for at least a t-hub. Polish has frekwencja, so that's at least one. Any objections? Vininn126 (talk)\n\nIt seems pretty SOP to me, but I can see sense in making it a t-hub. Theknightwho (talk)\n\nIt seems SoP to me too, but other OneLook dictionaries have it (really just WordNet 3.0; not MWOnline, AHD, Collins, Cambridge, Oxford). DCDuring (talk)\n\nDoing a quick, cursory check, it seems that at least a few languages have a single word for this, including German Wahlbeteiligung and Finnish äänestysprosentti (though our current def is \"polling percentage, perhaps @Surjection can comment if \"voter turnout matches), so we have at least 3 languages that might benefit. Strictly speaking, Polish frekwencja is \"number of people participating in something\", with \"frekwencja wyborcza\" strictly being \"voter turnout\", but very frequently (pun intended) you see a type of ellipsis where just \"frekwencja\" means specifically voter turnout. Vininn126 (talk)\n\nBoth German and Finnish are highly synthetic languages, aren't they? We don't usually (and IMHO shouldn't) accommodate all of the possible words they can form with English translation hubs. DCDuring (talk)\n\nSeems SoP to me. — Sgconlaw (talk)\n\nMake the damn entry already P. Sovjunk (talk)\n\nI dunno, to me it seems fairly SOP. Vininn126 (talk)\n\nKeep uncreated. PUC –\n\nCreate it since it can serve as a good t-hub as per Vininn. MedK1 (talk)\n\nVininn seems to have had a change of heart. DCDuring (talk)\n\nI was mostly keeping the joke going. I still want to see if there are enough entries for a t-hub. Vininn126 (talk)\n\nKeep uncreated, given that translations exclusively denoting turnout in the electoral sense can be (and are) accommodated at turnout#Translations with qualifiers. voter turnout and electoral turnout (less common but still used) could be added as collocations under sense 2. Or alternatively (or additionally) the electoral sense could be split out as a subsense of turnout sense 2 with its own translation box. Voltaigne (talk)\n\nWhat makes the definition of turnout for this collocation distinct from the definition in, say, volunteer turnout, marcher turnout, attendee turnout, primary turnout, caucus turnout? Turnout alone, in context, means \"election/voter turnout\". DCDuring (talk)\n\nMy suggestion was either to add voter turnout as a collocation under sense 2 (in which case it would illustrate a specific application of the broader \"turning up and participating\" sense, not a distinct sense), or adding a (nested) subsense of sense 2 (deriving from it, not distinct from it). Another possibility is to do neither of these. Voltaigne (talk)\n\nIs there a difference between senses 1 (\"the state of being self-confident\") and 2 (\"a measure of one's belief in one's own abilities\")? PUC –\n\nPretty sure that the writer of the def had in mind the nongradable/binary versus gradable/degree distinction, but it seems like stretching too hard in this instance. This strikes me as one that would take \"the state or degree of\" as a single def. I have been to that entry before but did not dwell mindfully on the asserted sense differentiation. Quercus solaris (talk)\n\nI went ahead and did \"the state or degree of\" as a single def, per WT:BOLD. Quercus solaris (talk)\n\nSame, is there a difference between senses 1 (\"Habitual moderation in regard to the indulgence of the natural appetites and passions; restrained or moderate indulgence\"), 2 (\"Moderation, and sometimes abstinence, in respect to using intoxicating liquors\") and 3 (\"Moderation of passion\")? Why would the quote under sense 2 (\"On these occasions I have noticed such a dreamy, vacant expression in his eyes, that I might have suspected him of being addicted to the use of some narcotic, had not the temperance and cleanliness of his whole life forbidden such a notion\") not fit under sense 1? I don't see it supporting the distinction at all. PUC –\n\nThe quote definitely fits sense 1, not sense 2. Sense 2 may be somewhat dated, but it is quite distinct in my opinion. The temperance movement, specifically, did not endorse consuming alcohol in moderation, or general restraint from all temptations. It was specifically about establishing the Prohibition of alcohol. To promote temperance was to be a teetotaler. Qwertygiy (talk)\n\nYes, exactly. All three senses are distinct, but I think sense 3 could use some fleshing out. Sense 1 is the cardinal virtue of temperance, sense 2 is an alcohol-specific sense, which could perhaps be made a subsense of 1, and sense 3, as the synonyms illustrate, is not so much about restraint and more about having a calm demeanour (it's like the mood equivalent of a temperate climate). Andrew Sheedy (talk)\n\nI'd need to see quotations of sense 1 vs sense 3 to tell how distinct they are, but So many uses of temperance have meant sense 2 specifically to the exclusion of the other things sense 1 could refer to that I think it makes sense to have 2 as a separate sense, like the slavery-related sense of abolitionist. - -sche (discuss)\n\nPortuguese. Both of \"arrepender\"'s senses are reflexive. Should the page be therefore \"arrepender-se\"? But then again, I really can't seem to be able to find a lot of Portuguese pages with \"-se\" in them. Maybe what should be done is change \"esbaldar-se\" to \"esbaldar\"? The reflexive can always be represented in the conjugation table like in my latest edit. MedK1 (talk)\n\nOn WP, through bridge redirects to truss bridge. Our definitions look different to me, but that may be because through bridge uses 100-year-old English, and I am a fool P. Sovjunk (talk)\n\nThe use of tissue in the MW 1913 definition suggests that one should exercise care in using extended metaphorical, figurative meanings of terms. Century 1991 had as a definition of tissue: \"Figuratively, an interwoven or interconnected series or sequence; an intimate conjunction, coördination, or concatenation.\" But the flimsy nature of tissue paper and the lack of rigidity in biological tissue make the connection of tissue to a rigid structure of metal beams that could support railroads non-intuitive for us.\n\nThe Venn diagram of possible referents of the two terms would overlap. In principle several types of bridge structures could be called through bridges. In fact, it seems that there are through arch bridges and through truss bridges. I don't know whether anyone calls any suspension bridge or cable-stay bridge a through bridge, though such bridges have a deck that is mostly surrounded by the structure. Maybe the core requirement for a bridge to be called a through bridge is that the deck is completely surrounded by the structure. Not all truss bridges are through bridges, as the WP article shows. It would take some citation mining to find the (probabilistic) limits of application of \"through\" in bridge nomenclature. DCDuring (talk)\n\nThe definition doesn't appear to be substitutable, at least not in the context I'm familiar with: \"return to the status quo ante bellum\". PUC –\n\nAnd this isn't status quo + ante bellum (\"pre-war\")? DCDuring (talk)\n\nHow is it a learned borrowing, given the wide use of the components? How is it just \"legal\" in its usage context; or is that just someone trying to indicate topic? DCDuring (talk)\n\nI find sense 1 (\"The misrepresentation of one's own true motive\") incomprehensible. And what is the difference between senses 2 and 3? PUC –\n\nSense 1 concerns false pretense about one's own motives, such as those of a manipulator or those of a troll for example. In 2 vs 3, I think the distinction they were after is fraudulent behavior generally versus nefarious/ulterior motives when filing suit specifically. For laypersons I'd agree that those don't need to be separate senses. Maybe a legal dictionary would keep them separate. For example, Black's 6e s.v. bad faith does give a contractual sense and an insurance sense as special cases of the general sense (given first). But that's not a general dictionary, whereas Wiktionary is. Quercus solaris (talk)\n\nRegarding sense 1, all right, but I don't think the definition is substitutable. I do agree it has got to do with the (deliberate) misrepresentation of something, but I'm not sure \"one's own motive\" is the right term. PUC –\n\nFor sense 1, take the definition for sense 2 but omit the label “(law)”. In somewhat shortened form, we get: “Intent to deceive or mislead to gain some advantage.” A bad-faith interpretation is an interpretation made in bad faith, that is, an interpretation made with the intent to deceive or mislead to gain some advantage. --Lambiam\n\n@Lambiam @PUC No, I don't think that's right: sense 1 refers to saying things with an ulterior motive in order to manipulate (e.g. trying to embarrass someone), but it needn't be overtly deceptive. Sense 2 refers to fraud, which is. Sense 1 is the general sense, and covers senses 2 and 3, but we need both of those because both they're technical uses of the term in specific contexts. Theknightwho (talk)\n\nDeceptive moves are usually covertly deceptive, unless the operator is totally inept. It will be helpful if we have examples of use of the term (in a non-legal or existentialist context) for which the definition “Intent to deceive or mislead to gain some advantage” is not applicable. Perhaps simply “Dishonest intent” or \"Malicious intent”? --Lambiam\n\nAgain, does it really have four senses??? Sorry for the flurry of questions, but I've been stumbling upon many cases of poorly distinguished senses and it's driving me crazy. PUC –\n\nBy the way, other dictionaries indicate it's a Britishism, but our entry doesn't reflect that. PUC –\n\nIt happens a lot with everyone's favourite quote-adder Kiwima (talk • contribs). P. Sovjunk (talk)\n\nWhat are you saying about me? I never even touched that entry! What do I do a lot? Kiwima (talk)\n\nThe two dictionaries referenced under Further reading, Merriam-Webster and Longman Dictionary of Contemporary English, each have just one sense, basically the same sense (“show willingness”). I think this covers all uses in the quotations. --Lambiam\n\nThe first page says the latter is a synonym for it. I kind of disagree; I feel like \"eating like a pig\" has negative connotations of bad manners and slobbery eating, while \"eat like a horse\" just means they ate a lot, not necessarily churlishly. I added a translation for \"eat like a pig\" into another language but then, seeing how the other page was already a translation hub and is considered a synonym, I moved the translation over. Does anybody agree with me that they've got different senses? Should I undo the move? MedK1 (talk)\n\nI agree. I never would have thought they were synonyms. Andrew Sheedy (talk)\n\nAgreed. Although one would not be surprised if one heard conflation of them, they are not synonymous. I would call them more cot than rel. Coordinate ways for humans to eat like an animal. Quercus solaris (talk)\n\nAgree. — Sgconlaw (talk)\n\nI note that the entry for eat like an animal mentions only quantity. I thought it equally applied to eating with poor manners (i.e., \"like a pig\")? Andrew Sheedy (talk)\n\nAgreed; I tweaked it. These various entries are definitely improved now, compared with when they asserted synonymy. If anyone quibbles about status as cot, I would accept see-also instead; but there is some essential coordinateness involved, and in my opinion it is best to try to show that when it exists. Quercus solaris (talk)\n\nIf someone eats like a bird, do they eat like an animal? --Lambiam\n\nHave to say no, which shows the limits of figurativeness/metaphor in natural language. Each metaphor is valid within its constraints, but juxtaposing them shows the boundaries. So we show eat like a bird as ant to eat like an animal because that's what it is idiomatically, even though bird is hyponymous to animal. Quercus solaris (talk)\n\nI remember talking with someone who defended his use of the word animal as a synonym for mammal, saying that it only includes birds when used in juxtaposition with plants or some other non-animal group. I couldn't accept that but he has a point ... in many contexts, if I hear the word animal, especially stressed (you put humans alone on an island with ANIMALS?!!) Im going to think of large mammals first.\n\nTo me, eat like an animal means to eat without using one's hands, which we almost never do, and therefore I simply dont use this expression. I suspect most people don't take it so literally, but I bring it up because we might be able to find translations in other languages in which a word covers both the literal use and the figurative (e.g. consider English gobble). —Soap—\n\nSeems not quite synonymous to me. Compare to 'piss like a pig' (spatter) and 'piss like a horse' (a lot). But there are some people who avoid comparison of humans to pigs, so in this case i've heard of native English speakers the use of 'horse' as a dirty human. Tollef Salemann (talk)\n\nRegarding the sixth determiner sense, which had been \"approximately, about (with a number)\" and was just changed to \"Emphasizing a number\": are we dealing with two senses here, for \"about\" vs \"exactly\"? Or are they both just emphasis? With bigger numbers, it seems to normally mean \"about\", not \"exactly\": Merriam-Webster has a sense \"About\" with the usex \"some 80 houses\" (they also assign \"twenty-some people\" to this sense), and Henry David Thoreau (born 1817) wrote in Walden (published in 1854, plausibly written sometime earlier, after his last book in 1849) \"I have lived some thirty years on this planet [...]\" when he was several years older than 30. - -sche (discuss)\n\n@Equinox - -sche (discuss)\n\nIf it is not exact, it must mean \"at least\": I don't think \"some 10,000 pounds were spent on the project\" could mean only £9,999, right? What you cite above must be a separate sense I've never heard of, maybe unused in BrE. Equinox ◑\n\nUsually when people say \"there were some 50 items pending\" or \"I have lived some thirty years on this planet\", what \"some\" means is \"about\", that is, \"approximately\". It is done especially when they want to focus on the ballpark (sig figs) and ignore the spare change (that is, \"they spent some 300 million on the boondoggle\" means \"they spent around 300 million and change on the boondoggle\"). The ux items under what is currently numbered as sense 6 are properly illustrations of this sense (\"approximately\"). Quercus solaris (talk)\n\n@Quercus solaris Are you agreeing with Equinox? DCDuring (talk)\n\nNo, I was maintaining that the \"about\"/\"approx\" sense needs to be maintained. But I just looked at the entry now and I see that both the \"about\" sense and the \"emphasizing\" sense are listed (6 and 7), and I'm fine with that. Thanks Quercus solaris (talk)\n\nOK, I re-added the sense \"about\" with some cites and refs, but left \"Emphasizing a number\" for now. Is it distinct from the sense that's right after it, \"a remarkable\", as in \"he is some acrobat!\"? I don't want to burden people with wading through all the hits for \"some [number]\" that are other senses (including \"about\"), if the emphasis sense is also real. But off the top of my head, the only 'emphatic' interpretation of \"She had been employed at that company for some five years now\" that comes to mind is emphasizing the characteristics of the years, rather than emphasizing the number, like \"She worked here for just two days, but she worked here for some two days: first we got robbed, and then she invented a cure for cancer!\", which is I think the \"remarkable\" sense. BTW, we have this \"approximately [a number]\" sense as both an adverb and a determiner; which is it? Merriam-Webster and Dictionary.com have it as an adverb, but they also don't seem to recognize a determiner POS (at least for this word) at all. - -sche (discuss)\n\nGrammatically, for both these definitions, it seems to be the noun that is modified. I agree that semantically some can be replaced by approximately in most cases, which makes the adverb PoS seem right. I'd argue that cases like: \"It was some three meters long.\" / \"No, it was more like exactly 10 feet long.\" suggest that it is the NP being modified rather than the number. I would distinguish this from the [number]-some case where it is clearly the number being modified. DCDuring (talk)\n\nY'all want some? How many? PUC –\n\n\"When the word poor is used to express pity, it does not change the meaning of the sentence...\" etc. This seems, well, poorly worded... Equinox ◑\n\nAgreed. Can probably do without the usage note. It seems like it may have been prompted by an urge to provide ESL/EFL help, but I think that sense 3 and its ux probably does enough for any user (even ESL/EFL), especially if the soup line is moved up to be a ux there (\"Used to express pity.\" / ux \"Oh you poor little thing.\" / ux \"Give this soup to that poor man!\"). The usage note, although true, is probably not for Wiktionary as much as it is something that an ESL/EFL tutor would explicate while tutoring. Good effort though. Quercus solaris (talk)\n\nI don't think the non-gloss definition is necessary. It seem to imply more than it should. Many dictionaries have a gloss definition or synonym \"pitiable\" or \"exciting pity\". It might be good to have a usage example in which poverty is not what is pitiable: \"She didn't catch the mouse! Poor kitty!\". (I hope someone can do better than that.) DCDuring (talk)\n\nKitty caught the mouse. Poor mouse! --Lambiam\n\nThe usage note appears indeed somewhat unnecessary. This is a common phenomenon in (AFAIK) all human languages. In “the dirty bastard had just stabbed me in the back”, the attribute dirty does not serve to avoid a misunderstanding that the perpetrator was some other, cleaner bastard. And in “he stared with disgust at the unappetizing mess”, the reader would not assume the presence of an appetizing mess. When we read that “the good woman had been very kind to him”, we know it does not serve to distinguish her from the not-so-good women. And so on and so forth. --Lambiam\n\nThe usage note has been improved in this edit. --Lambiam\n\nAgreed — it's that underlying theme of whether (or not) the adjective distinguishes one X from another X. My mind is reaching for the words determinative a"
