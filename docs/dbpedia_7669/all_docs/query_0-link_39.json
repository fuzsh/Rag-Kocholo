        "text": "English\n\n[edit]\n\nEtymology\n\n[edit]\n\nPopularized by Julie Connelly in a 1989 Fortune magazine cover story, by analogy with a real estate trophy building.[1][2][3] (This etymology is missing or incomplete. Please add to it, or discuss it at the Etymology scriptorium. Particularly: “An editor of the Wikipedia trophy wife page thinks it is older, possibly 1950 or 1965”)\n\nNoun\n\n[edit]\n\ntrophy wife (plural trophy wives)\n\n(derogatory) A wife, usually young and attractive, regarded as a status symbol for the husband, usually older and affluent.\n\n1991, Douglas Coupland, “It Can't Last”, in Generation X, New York: St. Martin's Press, →OCLC:\n\n[…] while Mrs. Scott-Baxter, his fourth (and trophy) wife, blonde and young and bored, glowered at the Baxter spawn like a mother mink in a mink farm, just waiting for a jet to strafe the facility, affording her an excuse to feign terror and eat her young.\n\n1993 March, Sally Ogle Davis, “The good, the bad and the disasters”, in Ladies' Home Journal, page 57:\n\nBut don't expect this one to break up. Arnold [Schwarzenegger] got his trophy wife—a real-life Kennedy, his entreé to the top social echelons in the country—and he's not about to let her go.\n\n2008, Julia Llewellyn, The Model Wife, Penguin UK, →ISBN:\n\n‘She's with her nanny.’ ‘Oh yeah, I forgot. You're a proper trophy wife now. Staff and everything. Well…’ She produced a bottle of cava from a plastic bag. ‘With no child to keep up appearances for, let's get ourselves in the mood.’\n\n2013, George G. Nyman, Love Lost in Time Relativity, AuthorHouse, →ISBN, page 12:\n\nShe was David's fourth wife. Twenty-four years his junior, they both knew why they were together. David was filthy rich, and Belinda was a trophy wife. In fact, this was her third time around in this career: Being a trophy wife.\n\nTranslations\n\n[edit]\n\nSee also\n\n[edit]\n\narm candy\n\nReferences\n\n[edit]\n\nFurther reading\n\n[edit]"
