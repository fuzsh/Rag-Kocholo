        "text": "After 7 years of governing California, Arnold Schwarzenegger stepped down after the end of his second term. On January 2, 2011 Jerry Brown, a Democrat, took over running Americas most populous state.\n\nSchwarzenegger, a body-builder who came from Austria when he was 20, came to power in 2003 after a special recall election which got rid of Gray Davis who was very unpopular at that time.\n\nSchwarzenegger was a media star from the first minute on. Reporters followed him every step of the way, everything he did was broadcast on TV and the internet. On the first day in office he cancelled the car tax which was supposed to go into effect.\n\nThe Governator had great plans for California. He promised the “Golden State” a golden future. Improving infrastructure, creating better schools, reforming prisons and protecting our environment were his visions, but he didn’t have the money to pay for everything.\n\nWhen he came to office Schwarzenegger talked voters into borrowing $15 billion to do away with the budget problem he inherited from his predecessor. Instead of balancing the budget Schwarzenegger left California in a worse condition than when he started out in 2003. The state’s budget deficit rose from $6 billion in 2003 to over 25$ billion at the end of 2010.\n\nCalifornians wanted to give the Governator a fair chance. They knew that it would take some time to learn how government in a state the size of California worked. Schwarzenegger had a Democratic Senate to deal with and he was surprised when they didn’t do everything he wanted.\n\nBefore his political career started, Arnold Schwarzenegger had been a body builder and actor. He started training with weights at the age of 15. At 20 he became Mr. Universe and left Austria for America, where he became famous as a Hollywood action star. He had leading roles in films like Conan the Barbarian and the Terminator.\n\nDuring the 2004 Republican convention Schwarzenegger was at the height of his fame. Some Republicans even wanted to change the law to make it possible for a foreign-born American to become President.\n\nBut in the last years of the Governor’s term, his popularity faded. In the end only 30% of all Californians supported his work. They found out that Schwarzenegger was no superman that could turn around the state’s economy. They had the feeling that their lives had not improved since 2003. But Arnie, as he is nicknamed, also had good days, especially when he fought for preserving the environment."
