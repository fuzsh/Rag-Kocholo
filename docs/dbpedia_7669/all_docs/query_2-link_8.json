        "text": "AFTER decades as an actor and bodybuilder, Arnold Schwarzenegger pursued a political career.\n\nDuring The Terminator alum's first election campaign, he succeeded Gray Davis and became Governor of California.\n\nIs Arnold Schwarzenegger a Republican or Democrat?\n\nArnold Schwarzenegger identifies as a member of the Republican Party.\n\nBefore Arnold ran for office in 2003, he had long been a supporter of Republican causes.\n\nPreviously, the Emmy Award winner cited Richard Nixon and Ronald Reagan as political influences.\n\nAt the 2004 Republican National Convention, he told the crowd: \"I finally arrived here [the United States] in 1968.\n\n\"I had empty pockets, but I was full of dreams. The presidential campaign was in full swing.\n\n\"I remember watching the Nixon and Humphrey presidential race on TV.\n\n\"I heard Humphrey saying things that sounded like socialism, which is what I had just left. But then, I heard Nixon speak.\"\n\nArnold added: \"He was talking about free enterprise, getting government off your back, lowering taxes and strengthening the military.\n\n\"Listening to Nixon speak sounded more like a breath of fresh air.\n\n\"I said to my friend, 'What party is he?' My friend said, 'He's a Republican.'\n\n\"I said, 'Then I am a Republican!' And I've been a Republican ever since! And trust me, in my wife's family, that's no small achievement!\n\n\"I'm proud to belong to the party of Abraham Lincoln, the party of Teddy Roosevelt, the party of Ronald Reagan and the party of George W. Bush.\"\n\nWhen was Schwarzenegger elected Governor of California?\n\nOn October 7, 2003, Arnold was elected Governor of California after winning that year's recall election against incumbent Gray Davis.\n\nOn November 17 of the same year, the seven-time Mr. Olympia winner assumed office.\n\nOn November 7, 2006, he was reelected over Democratic nominee Phil Angelides.\n\nHis political causes ranged from the environment, sustainability, energy efficiency, healthcare, and education.\n\nWho succeeded Schwarzenegger as Governor of California?\n\nOn November 2, 2010, Democratic candidate Jerry Brown was elected to succeed Schwarzenegger over Republican opponent Meg Whitman.\n\nBrown was officially sworn into office on January 3, 2011."
