        "text": "Tickets on Sale Nov 4; Tour Kicks Off Jan. 27\n\nComedian to Appear in 20+ Cities Across U.S.\n\nCobb Energy Centre – Friday, March 24\n\nFeimster Featured on CBS Saturday and in PEOPLE Magazine, On Stands Now\n\nComedian, writer, and actress Fortune Feimster announces her new Live Laugh Love! tour. Like her recently released hour-long Netflix special, Good Fortune, her live show captures the hearts of viewers and critics alike. Tickets for the 2023 tour go on sale Friday, Nov. 4 at 10 a.m. local time at FortuneFeimster.com.\n\n“There is nothing better than performing live and with every tour the shows just get more and more fun. I can’t wait to get back on the road and share new stories about my life and family,” shares Feimster. “I named the tour ‘Live Laugh Love!’ because of those infamous signs you see in a lot of mom’s homes…my mom being no exception. And when I got older, I realized I too had one of those signs and thought ‘uh oh, I’m becoming my mom.’ What that means will be revealed on the tour. Plus, who doesn’t want to live, laugh, and love?”\n\nAffable, charismatic, and one of a kind, Feimster uses her confessional comedy to bring people together. Through laughter and storytelling, she shows audiences of all ages, backgrounds, and sexual orientations that common ground is only a joke or two away. She has expanded on that commonality with her new special, “Good Fortune,” with Decider noting, “Feimster remains the fun aunt, cousin, or friend you want to sidle up to at the party.” Beginning Jan. 27, fans can do just that, as CBS News opines the comedian is, “having a moment.” She brings stories from her life along with lots of laugher and love to over 20 cities across the U.S. from Portland, Maine, to Atlanta, Georgia, and Charleston, South Carolina to Las Vegas, Nevada.\n\nFor more information and to purchase tickets, visit FortuneFeimster.com and follow Feimster on Facebook @fortunefunny and on Instagram and Twitter @fortunefeimster.\n\nFortune Feimster: Live Laugh Love!dates are as follows:\n\n1/27/2023 Albuquerque, NM Kiva Auditorium\n\n1/28/2023 El Paso, TX UTEP Magoffin Auditorium\n\n1/29/2023 Midland, TX Wagner Noel PAC\n\n2/3/2023 Savannah, GA Johnny Mercer Theatre\n\n2/4/2023 Knoxville, TN Knoxville Civic Auditorium\n\n2/5/2023 Chattanooga, TN Soldiers & Sailors Memorial Auditorium\n\n2/17/2023 Indianapolis, IN Clowes Memorial Hall\n\n2/18/2023 Columbus, OH Palace Theatre\n\n2/19/2023 Lexington, KY Lexington Opera House\n\n2/24/2023 Dallas, TX Majestic Theatre\n\n2/25/2023 Austin, TX Paramount Theatre\n\n3/2/2023 Munhall, PA Carnegie of Homestead Music Hall\n\n3/3/2023 Cleveland, OH Connor Palace\n\n3/4/2023 Cincinnati, OH Taft Theatre\n\n3/16/2023 Medford, MA Chevalier Theatre\n\n3/17/2023 Boston, MA The Wilbur\n\n3/19/2023 Portland, ME State Theatre\n\n3/24/2023 Atlanta, GA Cobb Energy Performing Arts Centre\n\n3/25/2023 Augusta, GA Bell Auditorium\n\n3/26/2023 Charleston, SC North Charleston Performing Arts Center\n\n3/30/2023 Fresno, CA Saroyan Theatre\n\n3/31/2023 Sacramento, CA SAFE Credit Union\n\n4/1/2023 Las Vegas, NV Wynn- Encore Theatre\n\n4/22/2023 Nashville, TN Ryman Auditorium\n\nABOUT FORTUNE FEIMSTER\n\nStand-up comedian, writer, and actor, Fortune Feimster has been building an innovative, inclusive, and unique career for more than 20 years. Be it on the road, her radio show, film, or television, her contagious and joyous comedy is touching lives and bringing us together daily. It has made her one of the busiest women working today. She first became known as a writer and panelist on E’s hit show Chelsea Lately, and then starred as a series regular on The Mindy Project for Hulu and Champions for NBC. She has gone on to have many guest appearances on TV shows including Claws, 2 Broke Girls, Workaholics, Glee, Dear White People, and Tales of the City, as well as recurring roles on Showtime’s The L Word: Generation Q and CBS’s Life In Pieces.\n\nShe’s had memorable roles in the movies Office Christmas Party, Social Animals, and Father of the Year. She also recently voiced the role of Evelyn on The Simpsons, she’s the voice of Brenda on Bless the Harts for Fox, and she voices Ava on Summer Camp Island for the Cartoon Network.\n\nWhen not acting, Fortune tours the world doing standup. Her just released one-hour special on Netflix, “Good Fortune,” along with her first, “Sweet & Salty,” were met with great critical acclaim. She’s appeared as a guest on late-night including “The Late Show with Stephen Colbert,” “Jimmy Kimmel Live,” “Late Night with Seth Meyers,” “Conan” and more. Her previous half-hour specials on Comedy Central and on Netflix’s season one of “The Standups” led Decider to rave, “her presence is positively inspirational.”\n\nAs a writer, Fortune has teamed up with some of the industry’s greatest. She created and starred in the Tina Fey produced pilot Family Fortune for ABC. Additionally, Steven Spielberg’s production company, Amblin, recently acquired two features Fortune wrote, Bad Cop, Bad Cop and Field Trip, both of which she is attached to star.\n\nShe recently wrapped filming on a big Netflix action series with Arnold Schwarzenegger and she\n\ncan currently be heard every morning on Sirius XM’s channel 93 for Netflix with Tom Papa. On their show, What A Joke with Papa and Fortune, they interview tons of comics and talk all things comedy. She also hosts a weekly podcast with her partner, Jax, called Sincerely Fortune."
