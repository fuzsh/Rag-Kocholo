(This is a subject that's really close to me, as I am a previous and hopefully future participant in the aforementioned Bee) There is previous discussion in the Tea Room. So far the suggestions are:\n\nPut a concise explanation under a ===Trivia=== header in the entry, linking to Wikipedia's article on the Scripps National Spelling Bee. (This is what I had originally been doing.)\n\nFor those who don't like the Trivia header, merge ====Anagrams==== and ====Spelling bees==== (note L4 status) under one L3 header, ===Word play=== and still keep the information in the definition.\n\nPut all the SNSB winning words into an appendix and/or category, also having info in the entries (or not).\n\nPersonally, I would do all three.\n\nMy argument for putting info in entries: A dictionary serves to give information about words and their usage, while an encyclopedia gives information about the concepts the words represent. This is information about the word itself and how it has been used, therefore it belongs in a dictionary. Opinions would be greatly appreciated on this ... Thanks! L☺g☺maniac chat?\n\nThe content belongs under ===Trivia===, and while anagrams might also be under Trivia, I don't like the heading \"Word play\" (and have other plans for Anagrams, see above). It would be best if there was a template for doing this, both so it's easy to add, and then it's easy to modify if we want to. Conrad.Irwin\n\nPlease see Appendix:Scripps winning words -- Prince Kassad\n\nOk, then, I didn'tknow that was already there . . . so I guess the question is now do we want the info in the entries or not, and how? I don't want to decide this all by my lonesome ... L☺g☺maniac chat?\n\nPersonally, I am weakly hostile to having them in the entry, simply because these don't seem to add enough value to justify a change to ELE. Plus ===Trivia=== is kind of a lame heading, and invites people to add... even more trivial things. :-) -- Visviva\n\nI also dislike them. Anagrams are at least an objective property of the word, but having appeared in a particular competition is not. For me it's like having \"words that were played in Scrabble games in tournament finals\": arbitrary and non-useful. Equinox ◑\n\nWhat is clear is that they should could be in appendices and that any WP entries about these words should link to Wiktionary's entries as well as any appendices that we have. We need to make the content of all appendices more accessible to not-so-knowledgeable users, but our better appendices merit special attention. We could make a special effort to make Wiktionary a site of interest to spelling-bee contestants, who might make good contributors, based on a sample of one so far. DCDuring TALK\n\nThe info is in an appendix (though that could be improved, and is on my to do list for when I get the fast computer) and the WP entry does link here. And I hope that other spelling bee competitors who come here to contribute have more free time on their hands. (To quote the faun Tumnus: Then you must have had a very poor sampling.) So if the consensus is to remove the info from the entries (since I've done like, the first half...) then I could do that I guess. L☺g☺maniac chat?\n\nWe have many appendices which are pretty much lost in cyberspace because nothing links to it. I think it would be a great idea to have an Index on appendices, maybe sorted by subject. That way we would also be able to clean up that namespace much easier. -- Prince Kassad\n\nExcellent. Sorely needed. DCDuring TALK\n\nThe current policy says that, essentially glosses on derived terms, synonymous terms and antonyms are not specifically allowed, ever.\n\nThis has the unfortunate side-effect that some of the few articles in the wikipedia that are dictionaric shame the wiktionary with their coverage of the word. For example suffixes have mostly been deleted from thw wikipedia, but for example w:-gram had a long list of derived 'gram's including a brief indication of their meaning, where as -gram just has a pointless list, without anything to help the user find the right gram for a particular purpose.\n\nIt's completely unreasonable to expect users to click on them to find out what they mean, and English is not regular enough to be able to guess. So the list of words becomes unusable, but would be able to be usable if glosses are allowed.\n\nThis is even a problem for synonymous terms; there's a saying that 'there are no true synonyms'- every word is subtly different in emphasis, usage or shades of meaning, but the current layout pretends they are exactly the same.\n\nBasically I think that glosses should be permitted on synonyms, antonyms and derived words.Wolfkeeper\n\nWhich policy are you referring to? In practice, glosses are highly encouraged on all lists that need to be matched to senses, although obviously some pages are more thorough than others- see parrot for a well-glossed entry. Nadando\n\nSee: Wiktionary:Entry_layout_explained#Synonyms. It has a very specific layout, and all the other sections like antonyms and derived terms are supposed to follow it.Wolfkeeper\n\nAlso Wiktionary:Entry_layout_explained#Further_semantic_relations where it specifies about the others.Wolfkeeper\n\nI believe Wolfkeeper (talk • contribs) is referring to glosses after a word, as in {{term|word||gloss}} or {{onym|xx|word|gloss=gloss}}, not to the glosses before a list, as in {{sense|gloss}}. With synonyms it's usually moot — the gloss that heads the list should really apply to each word, or else they're not really synonyms (at least in English; with foreign-language words, there are some good uses of glosses) — but with other semantic relations, it's less so. And with derived terms and related terms, we don't even have the {{sense}} up front. —RuakhTALK\n\nI agree with Wolfkeeper (talk • contribs) and Ruakh (talk • contribs) to the extent that there are many cases where {{sense}} or something similar might be a good tool for grouping related terms and derived terms, which are our principal low-structure lists that are sometimes too long to be useful.\n\nI strongly disagree with the idea of having glosses for each term in any of the semantic and etymological relations lists because:\n\nIt would make intimidatingly long entries even longer\n\nIt would require massive effort to keep the glosses coordinated with the definitions.\n\nWouldn't a more widespread utilization of \"popups\" largely solve both problems, whatever the resource costs and the barriers to implementation? DCDuring TALK\n\nNo, I actually don't think that would be as good, you would have to point at each in turn to get its meaning, and it interferes with searches.Wolfkeeper\n\nEven with synonyms the words are never precisely the same; they usually have different emphasis. \"There are no true synonyms\".Wolfkeeper\n\n(Unindent) To clarify what is at stake: Wolfkeeper proposes that pages look like in this revision of \"-gram\", in which a gloss or a definition is stated right next to each listed derived term. The first four items of the list of derived terms as posted by Wolfkeeper to -gram:\n\n===Derived words===\n\ncorrelogram - in the analysis of time series, a plot of the sample autocorrelations r h {\\displaystyle r_{h}\\,} versus h {\\displaystyle h\\,}\n\ncosmogram - a flat geometric figure depicting a cosmology\n\nengram - a hypothetical means by which memory traces are stored\n\nengram - a term used in Scientology and Dianetics for a \"recording\" of a past painful event not normally\n\n--Dan Polansky\n\nYes, where that is appropriate. I'm not saying we would make that mandatory though. The point is for the policies to permit better quality entries. I think the current situation where you are essentially forbidden from this is clearly wrong.Wolfkeeper\n\nAnd those are not particularly good examples correlogram should be something like a plot of sample autocorrelations; brutally short.Wolfkeeper\n\nI'm having trouble getting into the head of the user of the page configured this way. What question is the user asking? Of the current design for the the Derived terms section, I imagine a small number of normal users to be asking \"What is that \"-gram\" thing that I'm trying to remember?\" or \"I know it ends in \"-gram\", but how do I spell it?\" I can also imaging Scrabble players using it. After that I get to questions that only special types of word nuts (like ourselves) would ask. DCDuring TALK\n\nHow about people just reading the list and having a way of remembering which are which? We're supposed to be writing articles to read, not just use for a particular directed purpose I think. The fact is that looking at a list of completely unlabelled -gram's is very hard particularly for younger people with smaller vocabularies.Wolfkeeper\n\nTo Wolfkeeper: I find the lists of derived terms useful even without glosses. I do click on the derived terms to find what they mean. From what I remember from past discussions that took place on Wiktionary, other people voiced similar sentiments. --Dan Polansky\n\nIf you really do think this, check out -logy. While I know a lot of those, some of them like enology or agrostology seem really obscure to me, and three or four words next to them would tell me whether I might be interested in going there or not. Maybe if you're a genius at greek perhaps these are all obvious, but not most people.Wolfkeeper\n\nThe real take-home point here is, I think that from a user interface point of view any link that takes you anywhere that you don't have any clue where it's taking you is a bad link. Every link should give you some clue. That these links are by policy completely unlabelled is just wrong.Wolfkeeper\n\nThen I have no clue what ypu are upset about. The user knows exactly where they are going because the link target is also the name displayed for the link. How can a user have \"no clue where it's taking you\" when the target entry of the link is displayed? --EncycloPetey\n\nWords are used to give a particular meaning. If you don't have any idea what the meaning is, what is the purpose of knowing that that word is related to another word? Knowing that a random list of letters is connected to -logy is incredibly hard to do anything with at all. That's not the way people work, they don't just learn random words; people learn new words by associating words with other things, knowing that agrostology is about grass connects it to other things like 'agrarian'. A dictionary that permits gloss is better than one that doesn't, you can read the list and immediately have a good idea what the words mean, otherwise people, particularly young people will read the list and have no clue what the words mean. It helps build people's vocabulary. If you don't do this, it presents a scary and forbidding list of long words to them and probably makes them feel stupid for not immediately knowing them. You don't want people to feel like that, the dictionary should bend over backwards to help people know what words mean and how they are used. The way this guideline is written, it's more like a deliberate uncaring punch in the face.Wolfkeeper\n\nBut that's why we have entries about each of those words. The entry for (deprecated template usage) ornithology (the study of birds) tells you about the component roots, the meaning, any grammatical or usage oddities, etc. There is no sense in duplicating that information in every location that the word ornithology (the study of birds) is used. If we did that every time ornithology (the study of birds) was used in a list of words, we'd be needless duplicating information that could just as easily be found by placing it at the entry for ornithology (the study of birds). Placing all the definitions into a list of synonyms or related terms swamps out the important information with lots of additional noise. Yes, it's noise, because it's not information about the current entry, but about another entry not being discussed on that page. If a long list of words is \"scary\", as you say, then how much scarier will it be when it's packed full of definitions as well as the words themselves? For the sake of our users, any list of Related terms should be kept visually simple so that a user can quickly see the portion of the word that is etymologically related, and not have to wade through lots of other information that should be on the entry for which it is relevant. --EncycloPetey\n\nHow is adding information that the reader would be likely to need, adding 'noise'? That's complete nonsense.Wolfkeeper\n\nIn the case of derived words, for example for a suffix, it is information about the current subject of the article; 'you can add this to this suffix to make a word that can mean X', or you can add this to make it that; this is exactly the kind of thing that people read suffix articles to find out. Simply having a list of words is, in general, really very useless.Wolfkeeper\n\nBy request, you can now add Translation requests with the Translations editor, simply specify {{trreq}} in place of a translation. Conrad.Irwin\n\nWhile RC patrolling I ran across talarozole, which got me questioning a few things. Is it okay to be listing the applications for a drug? Isn't that a form of making medical claims? Should we include experimental pharmaceuticals which have not received any approval for use in humans? Do we need to include the health applications, or could we instead limit the information we provide to what portion of medicine prescribes the product. Is this a form of marketing, similar to the (Pharmacorp-produced) Nurses and Physicians drug reference books?\n\nAfter some personal discussion about it with Equinox, I'm bringing it here to at least open a discussion about it.\n\nIn the interests of full disclosure, I've been involved in clinical trials research and research ethics, which might bias my point of view. - Amgine/talk\n\nIf we say what Scholar articles and the financial press say about the product, especially emphasizing the intent of the developers/marketers and stick our usual attestation standards how could this be a problem realistically? I don't entirely see how we can realistically keep up with the changing status of the drug, but that is a problem we have with all of our encyclopedic content. DCDuring TALK\n\nRight. But to avoid any seeming \"form of making medical claims\" we can use (say) \"...drug used for...\" instead of \"...drug for...\".​—msh210℠\n\nI'd be even happier with \"drug being tested for\" before it is approved. Even if our entry falls behind the real world, we would be erring on the side of caution. I don't know that we would want to be talking about off-label uses. Let WP do that kind of thing if they want. The shorter the entry the less likely anyone would actually rely on it, IMHO. DCDuring TALK\n\nThat was oddly prescient based on today's announcement about Pfizer (2.4 billion USD fine for off-label advertising.) Being paranoid, I think the structure \"used in oncology\" or whatever general portion of medicine regularly prescribes the product would be both less specifically marketing, and a strictly factual (rather than medical) claim. - Amgine/talk\n\nThe financial press often reports that companies have a new drug for X. No one takes that as marketing. In addition, these drugs have to be prescribed. Are doctors going to be relying on us? People make all sorts of explicit and implicit claims for the efficacy of all sorts of products for achieving all all sorts of desirable outcomes. We are in no position to attest to the truth or falsity of any of those claims. Saying that \"X\" is the name of a drug used to treat a disease is not a statement that X is effective against a disease.\n\nWhat do you make of [[crystal ball]] or [[doctor]]? I find [[doctor]] to be somewhat misleading. It seems to imply that many people can heal the sick, but that only doctors are licensed to do so. \"Heal\" implies a successful outcome. \"Treat\" the sick would be less misleading. The \"heal\" wording passed its fifth anniversary at Wiktionary just this week. Perhaps en.wikt bears responsibility for some of the excessive faith in the medical profession that has made US medical costs so high. DCDuring TALK\n\nActually, the press reporting about a new drug is marketing, and it's always assumed as such by anyone who knows much about financial news. Even when working on en.wikinews I was being targeted by marketers with press releases about pharmaceuticals. I suppose I should kick start another article, like the Senate staff one to show who is editing the drug articles on wikipedia. {{unsigned}]\n\nMy point was intended to be that the financial press (vastly more suable than WMF) doesn't seem too worried. The attack of scrupulousness that we are suffering about this seems over the top. We are not so aggressively skeptical about all other implausible claims that appear in our entries. Has the outrageously silly one in doctor generated any concern, any complaints, any lawsuits? I suppose I ought to edit that one into shape. After all what do I expect: that it heal itself? DCDuring TALK\n\nThe press is not suable in this regard; they have specific protections in the US Constitution which do not apply to Wiktionary. But your arguments disregard the question: is it appropriate for a dictionary to make medical claims? I don't know, but I suspect not. - Amgine/talk\n\nActually, we don't have much skin in this and are not to be trusted to make this kind of decision. I suppose we really ought to kick this one upstairs to the folks with actual legal responsibility. Someone must have faced a related issue on WP. DCDuring TALK\n\nThis is still dodging the question. Surely we can address whether it is ethical - disregarding the legal ramifications? - Amgine/talk\n\nHow about we simply punt the issue of keeping up with encyclopedic claims concerning drugs to Wikipedia, which is an encyclopedia. Something along the lines of:\n\n==English==\n\n{{wikipedia}}\n\n===Noun===\n\n{{en-noun|-}}\n\n# A [[pharmaceutical]] with the chemical formula (FO<sub>2</sub>)BAr.\n\n[[Category:Pharmaceutical drugs]]\n\nOf course for drugs such as thalidomide that have been used attributively, as in thalidomide baby, fuller entries would be warranted. — Carolina wren discussió\n\nSimply giving a chemical formula does not provide context in which it is likely to appear. Whatever we choose to say, it ought to include enough information for a reader to interpret appearances of the word, such as in a novel. If a character in a novel inquires, \"Do you have any aspirin?\" a person looking up that word here would be unenlightened by a chemical formula. The novel is perhaps using the quote to indicate indirectly that a character has a headache or body ache. So, a minimal definition of (deprecated template usage) aspirin ought to indicate that aspirin is used for pain. We do not need to advocate a drug for a purpose, but we can certainly describe its use. For new or experimental-stage pharmaceuticals, I don't have as strong an opinion, as they are more likely to be neologisms and less likely to have meaningful connotations. --EncycloPetey\n\nI agree: the chemical formula is (99 times out of 100) insufficient.​—msh210℠\n\nI'd reverse that ratio, as far fewer that 1 out of 100 drugs will ever be widely known. There are thousands of pharmaceuticals these days. — Carolina wren discussió\n\nOr they could be inquiring after an aspirin in that hypothetical novel because they have a fever, are suffering from a heart attack or stroke, participating in a study as to whether it is effective in blocking the formation of cataracts, etc. Most times, the use to which a drug is being put to should be evident from the source text. If quotes such as \"My mistress is the aspirin I take for the aggravation my wife causes me.\" exist, I can see the need for a fuller entry than the bare bones one I described. But most drugs are not so well known for them to ever be used metaphorically or figuratively, so for entries such as (deprecated template usage) feprazone, (deprecated template usage) miraprofen, (deprecated template usage) nepafenac, (deprecated template usage) tarenflurbil, etc., a bare bones entry such as I described suffices, as it would for (deprecated template usage) talarozole. — Carolina wren discussió\n\nConsider\n\ngold—a heavy yellow elemental metal of great value, with atomic number 79 and symbol Au.\n\nand its alternative\n\ngold—a chemical element with atomic number 79.\n\nThe dictionary definition of gold is phrased not only in terms of underlying scientific properties such as its atomic number or chemical formula but also in terms of those properties or ways of interaction with the reader that are directly accessible to the perception and experience of the reader, such as color, heaviness, typical great value, or typical uses. As a consequence, many dictionary definitions are not 100% pure definitions in terms of logic but rather contain certain factual elements.\n\nWhen a drug is seen as an artifact, its use is its key characteristic; the likely main uses of hammer are fit for the inclusion in the definition of hammer.\n\nI do realize that with less known drugs there is an additional concern to avoid their unduly promotion or advertising, but only stating their chemical composition seems insufficient to me regardless of how widely known the drug is.\n\nI see no problem with the particular definition:\n\ntalarozole—an investigational drug for the treatment of acne, psoriasis and other keratinization disorders.\n\nIt states that (a) the drug is investigational, and (b) that it is investigated for the treatment of specific conditions, without saying anything about the efficacy of the drug. An additional statement of chemical formula would be in order, though. --Dan Polansky\n\nIn general I'm in agreement with you, Dan. However, note that we don't state gold is toxic, building up in the bone structure with symptoms similar to lead poisoning. Another way to phrase the definition might be:\n\ntalarozole—an investigational drug for dermatology.\n\ntalarozole—an investigational drug for skin disorders.\n\nLosing some specificity does not harm the informational value of the definition, imo. - Amgine/talk\n\nRelatedly (and not incidentally), I've just imported w:Wikipedia:Medical disclaimer to Wiktionary:Medical disclaimer (accessible indirectly via the \"Disclaimers\" link on every page). Please take a look, point out problems, and so on. We may also want to create some sort of {{medical-disclaimer}} template, for use on affected entries and categories. —RuakhTALK\n\nLet's ask a lawyer with experience in food and drug law. That would be me. Drugs sold in the U.S. and Europe, at least, must be approved by the appropriate regulatory agency for the specific purpose for which they are used. When they are used for another purpose, this is called an off-label use, and is a violation of the law (although rarely punished if the drug is not hazardous when used for such a purpose). We could, with no legal or moral jeopardy, state that the drug has been approved for use in a particular area, or is being investigated for use in a particular area. For drugs approved in the U.S., we can link directly to the FDA page which contains all indications and cautions. bd2412 T\n\nAs our attorney (based on the $1 I will be forwarding to you as retainer once you give me your address or bank routing number), would you advise that we as individuals face any personal legal risk from carelessness in our wording of what the uses are? Do stewards, bureaucrats, or admins face more risk than registered or unregistered users? Does anyone face any risk apart from WMF? If WMF faces risk and we do not, are we not morally compelled to take advice from them. Are they in any way protected by not knowing of the risk that we think we see? DCDuring TALK\n\nThis gets us more into encyclopedia territory, but so long as we are not representing that a drug is in fact safe or effective for a particular purpose, we can identify any uses to which it is allegedly actually put by reference to sources supporting those allegations. We can incur no legal jeopardy whatsoever for accurately reporting that a drug has been approved by a government agency for a particular use, or that it has actually been used for that purpose, even if it is ineffective. For example, we can say that amygdalin or laetrile is a substance that has been used as a treatment for cancer, but has not been proven effective for that purpose. bd2412 T\n\nTo avoid legal problems, we should be able to leave the text to something like:\n\n==English==\n\n{{wikipedia}}\n\n===Noun===\n\n{{en-noun|-}}\n\n# A [[pharmaceutical]] (or [[drug]]) used for [[x]] (or \"used to treat [[x]])\n\nThis is a dictionary, and a dictionary's job is to describe a word and its usage, so if we stick to something like that ... This is probably exactly what bd2412 just said but I like to reword things to be simpler.... :) L☺g☺maniac chat?\n\nIf we are going to say that, we need to cite an external source for the claim. bd2412 T\n\nWhile working on the entry for the Catalan preposition per, I came across a sense in which the equivalent English translation is a nullity. I used an unlinked empty set sign (deprecated template usage) Ø to indicate that, but I'm not at all happy with this solution, yet I can't think of a better one. The problem is likely of broader application than this one entry, which is why I brought it here instead of the Tea room. Any suggestions? — Carolina wren discussió\n\nNote the solutions used under (deprecated template usage) the for languages which have no definite article. The solution there is to say not used. If we agree this (or something else) is a good general solution for this, I recommend creating a template to include in such cases to make it uniform, with a possible link to an explanation of this phenomenon in general. --EncycloPetey\n\nNot quite an equivalent occurrence, but close. What you suggest works acceptably for translation tables when English -> FL yields nothing, since the lack of linking helps establish it as a usage note and not a translation, but in a sense line for a foreign language entry, I'd be worried that it might be interpreted literally as the word has the meaning of not used. — Carolina wren discussió\n\nWhy is any translation necessary? —RuakhTALK\n\nA green background like in {{trreq}} might help make it stand out from the other text. -- Prince Kassad\n\nI don't know from Catalan, but in the example given it looks to me like \"to\" is the translation of per. The \"to\" in \"to vacation\" is not the infinitive \"to\", so vacar would only match \"vacation\" AFAICT. But yes, for similar cases, if deemed necessary, I think you could just do something like:\n\n# {{non-gloss definition|Blah blah. No corresponding word is used in English.}}\n\n... and just leave it out when translating the example. The absence of the boldfaced term should speak for itself in most cases. The empty-set symbol is a bit distracting IMO. -- Visviva\n\nSee if you like my specific solution: translate per to in order to. —AugPi\n\nBy the way, in analogy to Spanish, the construction va anar sounds to me like being in the future tense, so El meu germà va anar a Tahití per vacar a la platja would be \"My brother will go to Tahiti in order to vacation on the beach.\" —AugPi\n\nI would like to see a uniform \"tag\", as it were, to categorise translations in which corresponding words cannot be found. I've encountered this before: in Finnish (TESL) and Chinese (solo), for example. Consistency is always good! What say you admin?

Dominic·t\n\nI am formally requesting bot status for my new bot, User:Di gama bot. It is not intended for any long-term 24×7 operations, but rather for short-term \"projects\" involving many edits. At the moment, it is being geared up for a mass page move of sign language entries following a change in the entry name style, in accordance with the proposal at Wiktionary talk:About sign languages. As of this message, the matter is not settled, but a change of some sort is likely and this bot is intended to do the heavy lifting.\n\nAs noted above, the job requires the ability to move pages and I don't think bots innately have that privilege, so it would need to be autoconfirmed as well. The program is not hashed out yet, but it will use a stock script of Pywikipedia in conjunction with a hand-gathered list of moves to be done. As I said earlier, it is a short-term project, and will be monitored by me for the duration. Any future projects using this bot will be requested similarly. —Di gama (t • c • w)\n\nI don't imagine there would be any objections, but I believe this is technically supposed to go through a formal WT:VOTE after being mentioned here. -- Visviva\n\nI've made a new vote page at Wiktionary:Votes/bt-2009-10/User:Di gama bot for bot status, but I notice that in the instructions at WT:VOTE, which state:\n\nReplace “Title of vote” with what you’d like to start a vote on, or add the relevant user in one of the boxes below.\n\nCtrl-A, Ctrl-C (select all, copy) of the text in that input box (it is the new link).\n\nEdit in a new tab that page and add the one line of magic text below the editbox.

If you are planning on starting a new vote, please:\n\nDon't rush.\n\nAllow other people to review the wording for at least a week before the vote starts (this is not necessary for the formulaic votes such as adminship requests). This ensures that simple errors, such as the one with counting the voting eligibility vote can be spotted.\n\n<edit>Don't</edit>Conrad.Irwin Change the vote after it has started. If a week is given for checking things over, it is unlikely there will be any need for this.\n\nAccept the outcome of votes. If the outcome of a vote can be ignored then there is no point in voting. By allowing time before voting starts to discuss issues, most problems can be avoided. If a vote is still inconclusive, then start afresh considering the feedback, there's no point in whipping a dead horse - and it\n\nAvoid using the vote's talk page for discussion of the issue being voted on, we have WT:BP for policy discussions and changes to vote talk pages are hard to notice.\n\nI don't know whether we should add these or similar points to a Wiktionary:Voting policy page, I'd like to hope it wasn't necessary but it seems that we are beginning to become too big to run by common sense alone. Conrad.Irwin\n\nPerhaps in the spirit of points one and two, you may want to præface № 3 with \"Don't\" -- unless I've misunderstood what you're trying to say. † ﴾(u):Raifʻhār (t):Doremítzwr﴿\n\nIndeed, with the Doremitzwr amendment and other editorial adjustments (like clarifying the referent to it in \"and it\" at the end of 4), this seems like a useful set of guidelines, possibly worth a vote once we are further along in this discussion. Whether guidelines alone are adequate is itself a worthwhile part of the discussion.\n\nRegrading 5. I am not sure that the vote page itself is a good place for extended discussion either. In meatspace, there are laws like \"No electioneering within 100 feet of the polling place\".\n\nItem 3. might be formalized that a vote commenced must proceed to its conclusion as originally worded or be deemed to have failed, requiring a restart of the process from start of the one week review of the wording.\n\nItem 4. The declaration to disregard rules subject to vote or the systematic practice of disregarding those rules would seem to be the kind of thing that should summarily disqualify one from membership in the community. DCDuring TALK\n\nOverall, this looks quite sane. DCDuring's fourth point also strikes true to me, though at this point in time it is slightly too late at night for me to make extended comments on this. However, I also would like to add that I am very, very sick of seeing hostility against people who are opposing a vote. The voting pages are perfectly okay for being a place for discussion, but I would like to see the hostility -- and that's from both sides, not just one -- ending. We don't need provocative comments in the explaining rationale for opposing a vote, but we also don't need provocative comments prompting what does something mean, or calling people imbeciles. The current voting farce, as it may be, prompts me to stick to my own little corner of the Wiktionary, despite the fact that there are numerous things that I do when the environment is pleasant to be around aside from Hiligaynon and Kapampangan. --Neskaya kanetsv?\n\nI too would like to see some sort of policy statement on votes, as some of our past (not just recent) votes have been unmitigated disasters. In addition to the above points, some other topics which might be worth addressing include canvassing, eligibility, vote structure, etc. Some initial thoughts of mine: Prohibitions don't necessarily have to have consequences. If we say \"canvassing is disallowed,\", but cite no specific result of engaging in such behaviour, we don't have to worry about trying to prove someone engaged in canvassing, and yet we still make note that it's frowned upon. That being said, a prohibition without sanctions is dependent upon civility, which is something we cannot always rely upon. Also, regarding pre-vote discussion (which I absolutely agree is a must for most votes, save admin votes etc.), maybe we could come up with a way to address the responsibilities of everyone else besides the vote creator. There have certainly been times where a discussion is started, and either no one participates, or everyone who participates seems hunky dory with it, and then the bill is voted down. Take Ivan's recent Serbo-Croation disaster. The SC merger was not exactly done in a dark corner. A policy page was set up concerning the proposed merger well ahead of time, its existence was advertised on the BP, and very few concerns were raised on its talk page. Then the vote is set up and everyone and their mom crawls out of the woodwork with cries of \"genocide.\" I think that certainly explains, although doesn't justify, the incivility seen from the proponents. I'm somewhat at a loss as to how this could be done, but I'd like to hear thoughts if anyone has them. Also, I would like to see a voting eligibility. Call me elitist if you will, but I think a minimum of experience and commitment to the project are absolutely reasonable conditions for a productive vote. And vote structure....how do we go about things when there are multiple options, considering the fact that we have higher standards than a democratic vote. Must there always be a \"none of the above\" option? Finally, could we at least think about something a little looser than \"support\" (i.e. I support only this option and no other). I know that there have been votes before, where I'd like to see some sort of decision, but wasn't absolutely set on it being my preferred option. Perhaps we could introduce a \"this is my first choice, but I'll vote on anything that achieves consensus\" option? Sorry this is so long, but there are more issues we need to address here than have been presented thus far. Also, it should be noted that it would be absolutely unjust if anything decided was applied ex post facto. -Atelaes λάλει ἐμοί\n\nI wonder if we could change the way we structure issue votes, just a little. Wikis are supposed to be about consensus, right? And votes are supposed merely to demonstrate consensus, except that for various reasons, that never seems to work around here. So maybe we should switch things up a little. Suppose we first have discussion, then have a vote only on whether to delegate the final resolution of the issue -- under certain ground rules -- to a particular page where everyone is welcome to participate. A consensus reached on the delegated page would then have policy authority; it could be brought back for a re-vote only if it could be shown either that no real consensus was established, or that the consensus reached was manifestly moronic. In any case, the burden of proof would be solidly on the person(s) seeking to overturn the established consensus. This would minimize the self-selecting effects of having a discussion on a specialized page -- since the page will already have been thoroughly brought to community attention -- but also avoid the usual mess that occurs when people want to try to reach a new consensus after a formal vote has started. Maybe we could trial this on some relatively non-controversial issue? -- Visviva\n\nI'm not too much against a voting eligibility, honestly. I'd just like to see the vote for it be a bit longer after a disaster vote, as until then I'm really not sure it's been discussed enough and that people aren't being reactionary. I'm also against the within X number months before the vote part because people like Connel and Dvorty and even occasionally myself take off from Wiktionary for periods of time longer than the X months, and that doesn't mean that we don't know enough about the project to come back if there is an important vote going on. I think that we do need to think a lot about the optiontype votes, because those also seem to be a recipe of some sort for disaster. (Note, more coherent thoughts will be put together in the morning.) --Neskaya kanetsv?\n\nI really like Cirwin's proposal, but also Visviva's suggestions. One really important point about Visviva's suggestions is that, if a consensus is reached, there is no need for a vote of any kind. Just a statement that consensus has been reached unless someone posts a disagreement within X, and then ask everyone who has had a dispute but dropped out of the discussion to review it again. Too many iterations of this, say more than two, would trigger a vote, of course. (Note that both these ideas and the voting model are susceptible to tyranny of the majority.) - Amgine/talk\n\nI think we need both a well-crafted voting system along the lines that Conrad suggests and mechanisms for reaching conclusions that are taken seriously but can me adjusted more readily than by vote of the type we've been having. Visviva's suggestion seems worth a try. We have had votes along the lines that Nesakaya has suggested.\n\nBut we need to not be too creative about voting systems. We could have perhaps a few different voting models but they need to be clearly understood and be well named with the voting model that applies to a specific vote clearly shown. The models might vary as to the percentage of vote required, the number of votes for a quorum, the accommodation of multiple choices, and delegation to a virtual subcommittee. Each voting model itself should the the subject to our most rigorous approval standard. A voting model perhaps could be testable once without requiring a rigorous vote. DCDuring TALK\n\nI agree with much of what others have written (Conrad's original five points, DCDuring (02:21, 7 September)'s comment on item three, and Visviva (06:43, 7 September)'s comments). Regarding DCDuring (16:23, 7 September)'s comments: We already have templated vote forms linked to from WT:V.​—msh210℠\n\nIn Danish words like \"baby carriage\", are usually compounds of the two corresponding nouns, in this case barnevogn from barn which is barne- in compounds and vogn which is unaltered. The article \"barne-\" exists as a Norwegian prefix, but I'm not really confident about calling it a prefix. My, uneducated, guess is that it is a compound of two nouns. Is there a parallel to this in other languages to emulate? If considered a prefix + postfix, we should make a affix template, which combines {{prefix}} and {{suffix}}. In the article wiener I added the prefix \"wiener-\", but again it doesn't feel right. Perhaps we should invent another term, like \"compound prefix\" and \"compound postfix\" to address this.--Leo Laursen – (talk · contribs)\n\nBy the way: barn can be either \"barn-\", \"barne-\", \"barns-\", \"børne-\" or -barn (-barnet, -børn, -børnene) in compounds.--Leo Laursen – (talk · contribs)\n\nFor what it's worth (I am unsure if it helps but let us see):\n\nIn Czech, words usually need to be inflected or modified before they can be compounded, like in \"hlavolam\" = \"hlavo\" (from \"hlava\") + \"lam\" (from \"lámat\"). I do not see the Czech \"hlavo-\" as a prefix, but have no sources to cite on this.\n\nIn German, there is often an additional \"s\" or \"es\" between two compounded words, like in Todesangst (=Tod+es+Angst), Inhaltsverzeichnis (=Inhalt+s+Verzeichnis).\n\nSee also User:Dan_Polansky#Compounds. --Dan Polansky\n\nAncient Greek is rife with compounds, and I think it silly and couterproductive to make affix entries for every word which appears in a compound. I simply list the regular component etyma if a word appears in a compound, and follows normal compound rules (i.e. ν changes to μ before labial, stem forms are used instead of lemma forms, so we see the stems of ἀνήρ and πούς (ἀνδρ- and ποδ- respectively) in ἀνδράποδον, accent recesses, etc.) However, if an affix cannot be traced to any regular word via regular changes, I make an affix entry and note related words (e.g. ἀρχι-). -Atelaes λάλει ἐμοί\n\nAtelaes, I totally agree. And thanks to Dan Polansky I found Category:Danish compound words and {{compound}}. Thanks a lot.--Leo Laursen – (talk · contribs)\n\nThere already is a template which combines {{prefix}} with {{suffix}}: it is {{confix}}. By the way, I am starting to grapple with the very same issue in Dutch, about whether to consider a morpheme as a word or an affix. For example: sfeer versus -sfeer. —AugPi\n\nI've had similar problems in Latin. My approach has been to consider the element a word if it has an independent existence with the same meaning and the same (or nearly the same) spelling. I do this in Latin also for prepended prepositions, such as ad in adsum, since it is also an independent preposition. So, by my Latin criteria, I would call Dutch \"-sfeer\" a word rather than a suffix. --EncycloPetey\n\nYour criterion seems reasonable, so I deleted -sfeer, since it can stand alone as sfeer. —AugPi\n\nJust to note, I've actually taken this one step further. If a word is a very common affix, in addition to being a regular word, I'll note some of its afix properties in the word entry. See διά (diá) for an example of what I'm talking about. This is in line with what standard Ancient Greek dictionaries are doing, and I find it to be a far easier way to organize information, and more helpful for the end user. -Atelaes λάλει ἐμοί\n\nMy only comment at this time is that I'd not want to call it a Prefix. I'm not sure what heading or contextual tag I'd use, but I dislike the idea of having a \"Prefix\" entry that isn't under the usual Prefix entry name. --EncycloPetey\n\nIt is fairly common in Czech and German for prefixes to come in pairs with prepositions; in German: auf, auf-; an, an-; zu, zu-, etc. So I would create the entry διά- (diá-) for a prefix, as I would expect that most prepositions would have a same-spelled prefix worthy of standalone documentation. But I know no Ancient Greek, and this is just the way I would do it following the model of Czech and German. --Dan Polansky\n\nMight our English chemistry terms be relevant? See e.g. (deprecated template usage) methoxy and then (deprecated template usage) methoxypyrazine, where we use the \"compound\" etymology template instead of \"prefix\". Equinox ◑\n\nStraw poll: Would you support an addition to WT:CFI along the lines of:\n\nPlace names\n\nA place name should be included if it is attested with three durably archived citations spanning at least 150 years. Listings on maps, in gazetteers, or in geographic dictionaries may not count toward the required three citations, although such listings may be used to provide additional information.\n\nI'm interested in providing some sort of place name criterion, and a longer span for supporting quotations seems a suitable way to do this objectively. I hesitate to extend the date span further, since there are major modern cities and nations that have been in existence for only a century or two. Nairobi was founded in 1899, for example. --EncycloPetey\n\nWhat’s the rationale behind 150 years? Why not include new cities? --Vahagn Petrosyan\n\nMany editors here complain about the inclusion of \"small\" or \"unimportant\" places, but we have repeatedly rejected \"importance\" criteria as encyclopedic. So, I figure that 150 years of citations establishes the durability of the word, which is more a lexical criterion. The choice of number is a bit arbitrary, but covers well more than a single century. It is also designed to push the upper limit of what might be usable, in order to (hopefully) appease the crowd that normally opposes the inclusion of place names. Note that the criterion only states what is to be allowed; an entry failing this criterion is not necessarily therefore excluded. Other considerations may permit its inclusion even when this criterion does not permit it. I would, for example, argue (in some other thread) that capital cities of nations should always be included. However, that is beyond the scope of this proposal. The goal of this proposal is not to exclude new cities, but to find an acceptable criterion for objectively including at least some of the place names we continually wrangle over. We can always debate additional place name criteria at a later date. --EncycloPetey\n\nI’m for including all place names without additional preconditions, but if 150 years is the only way to appease placename-haters, I would vote for such a proposal. --Vahagn Petrosyan\n\nI am of the same opinion. Good place names entries have linguistically interesting and important information. Can we, at least include large place names, no matter how old they are and famous place names (often used in news, literature, etc.)? Those are more likely to be sought by users. The \"statistical\" information about the size and the presence of universities, job opportunities, etc. matters here as these places are more likely to be used in the written form, therefore users will only welcome them. Anatoli\n\nI agree. I think it would be absurd not to have London and Chicago, if only for the etymological value, and to note translations. bd2412 T\n\nProving the existence of a word should be the only criterion. I already object to the \"3 years\" mentioned in CFI: paper dictionaries have good reasons for such criteria, but not a wiki. Words may really exist and really be used a few days after their creation. Why not really adopting, once and for all, the principle \"all words, all languages\" and focusing only on \"what's a word?\", \"what's a language?\", \"when does a word begin to exist in a language?\" Lmaltier\n\nI fail to see why the \"three independent durably archived citations\" rule cannot apply to cities as well. That rule just by itself filters out all small villages which will never be mentioned in any books. -- Prince Kassad\n\nSupport, but just as long as we keep in mind that this is a dictionary, which serves to explain words and their origins and usage, not the concepts themselvse. As long as we're just describing the name of any place and where it came from and what it describes (and not providing any information that really belongs in Wikipedia), then this is fine. And it really shouldn't matter whether the name is 150 years old or not, 'cuz of course, like Lmaltier said above, a word can gain usage really quickly. So if the name is widespread and has sufficient citations . . . sure, we can have 'em . . . :) L☺g☺maniac chat?\n\nI support this, as I definitely want to see more placenames here, but mirror the concerns of Logomaniac, and still think we need to better define how we define placenames. I think we're still confusing different referents with different definitions. Truth be told, I still don't have a strong mental grasp on it myself. This is still a problem with other types of proper nouns. If two guys are named John, the word \"John\" does not have different meanings for the two of them. Likewise, there are multiple Bloomingtons, and yet I think the word \"Bloomington\" does not have a different sense for the different cities, simply different referents. Again, this is all pretty hazy in my own mind, but I think we need to sit down and have a good discussion about what defining a proper noun really means. If we figure this out, I think it will help us avoid the encyclopedic info problem we've got. -Atelaes λάλει ἐμοί\n\nIf you don't mind, Atelaes (and everyone else), I could do a little explaining right now, at least of my take on the situation. There's a difference between \"word\" and \"concept\" - a concept is any tangible (or intangible) thing, while a word is just a term used to refer to that concept. That's also some of the difference between a dictionary and an encyclopedia - a dictionary explains the origins etc. of words themselves and defines which concepts they refer to, while an encyclopedia defines the concepts and lists the different words used to refer to that concept. So in your example, two guys named John, the two different guys are two different concepts but they are both referred to with the same word. Ditto with \"Bloomington\" - the different cities are different concepts but they are both referred to with the same word. As long as we as a dictionary stick to describing the words it'll be good. So with St. Cloud, an entry I created semi-recently, even though the word generally refers to the city in central Minnesota (a concept), there are other cities referred to with that word so I had to let the definition somewhere like \"any of several cities in the U.S.\". I think one of the problems we get into sometimes is that we tend to drift toward explaining the concepts themselves and not just the words. That's where it gets tricky. But for placenames, as long as we just explain the words themselves (and point people to Wikipedia), it should be fine. Wow that got long . . . But anyway, you now know my opinion on the subject :) L☺g☺maniac chat?\n\nI think the important criterion, besides proven to exist, is that a place name in a non-Engish land should first be given in the original spelling in the language of that place. I don’t think it is useful to have an English transcription of an Oriya village when we don’t have the name in Oriya. In patroling the language-cleanup category, probably the most common entry I encounter is that of an obscure village somewhere in India, written only in English and no hint of the native spelling or even the language of the village. I delete them out of hand if I can’t get the native name first. —Stephen\n\nIMO we definitely should not list every use of a city name. (To take London as an example, there are tons of them with nothing in common beyond the name.) That's about as bad as listing under Smith all of the millions of individual people who happen to have that name. OTOH, saying that something is a place name, and giving its ety, might be okay (though to be honest I don't like the sound of it, because there are simply so many, including the tiniest of villages, and it seems like clutter). Equinox ◑\n\nExactly. That is definitely not what we as a dictionary are supposed to do. Listing every use of a city name (or listing every person with the surname Smith) is purely and wholly encyclopedic, and will never belong in a dictionary. It just shouldn't happen here. So yes, we definitely should not do that. And we wouldn't have reasons to include the names of the tiniest of villages, because such would probably not have 3 independent durably archived citations and would therefore not meet CFI (o whatever EP is proposing to set up.), as Prince Kassad noted above. L☺g☺maniac chat?\n\n@Atelaes: I think that there is, for each person named John, a separate sense of the proper noun John. (However, all of them are covered by a single sense of the common noun John (“a person named John”), found in sentences like “There seem to be a lot of Johns in this town.”) We certainly don't want to include each such sense — instead, we give a non-gloss definition for a sort of meta-sense that covers them all — but the reasons for that don't necessarily apply to all place-names. If a name is only used for a tiny number of places, I don't see much need for that sort of artificially-vague meta-sense (except perhaps to avoid a \"slippery slope\"?). —RuakhTALK\n\nYes, there are infinitely different senses of the one proper noun, but a dictionary would never think of adding a list of such senses - i.e. 1) my brother's best friend, 2) my brother's other friend, 3) my uncle, etc... But they are all covered by a broader sense, still of the proper noun, referring to the name itself and then a common noun referring to anyone under this name. But even if a term (like a placename) is only used to refer to a small number of specific concepts (like towns/cities), we still shouldn't be listing those places as that is encyclopedic. We are just supposed to say that, hey, it is a placename (no matter how many cities it refers to) and point the user to Wikipedia if they want to find the specific places. Remember, this is a dictionary! (I like to say that) and a dictionary just gives the meaning of the word, not the different specific concepts that word refers to. It is almost as absurd as listing all the different types of televisions under the entry television. It just doesn't happen in a dictionary. L☺g☺maniac chat?\n\nThe meaning of John in John Smith and John Kennedy is the same, the meaning of Kennedy in John Kennedy and Edward Kennedy is the same. But the meaning of Paris (in France) and Paris (in Texas) is not the same, and this fact has linguistic consequences (e.g. possibly, pronunciation, etymology, or gentilic words). All senses should be listed, whether the word is a toponym or not. Lmaltier\n\nYou mean we're supposed to add a sense for every single city named \"Rochester\"?! Or \"Paris\"?! There are like, 10 different Rochesters in the U.S. and probably a lot elsewhere. Even if there's only 3 or 4 occurrences of a name, I would still prefer if we left it to \"A placename common in the <insert region here>\". Of course if everyone else decides other wise, well, I guess I could just stay out of it. L☺g☺maniac chat?\n\nYes, I mean exactly that. If you don't think it's necessary, have a look at fr:Beaulieu. You'll see that this page doesn't mention any encyclopedic info such as population, but it mentions linguistic information specific to each sense. Lmaltier\n\nThere's a Beaulieu in Hampshire, in case you want to add that one too! Equinox ◑\n\nBut the Paris in Texas (and presumably almost every other Paris) is named for the one in France; so we have only two senses - the first for the original in France, and a second for \"any of a number of other cities and towns named after the city in France\". bd2412 T\n\nThere may be only two different etymologies, but not only two senses. Are inhabitants of Paris (Texas) called Parisians? Maybe, but I'm not sure at all... This information should be mentioned, it's linguistic information. Lmaltier\n\nDon't oppose. I would really prefer that we stuck to the policy that proper names in mainspace have to be used to indicate something other than the literal referent. On the other hand, we should have a policy that people will actually follow consistently. This seems like such a policy. Also, an advantage to the 150-year (or similar) criterion is that it rules out ephemeral region names (metropolitan statistical areas, forest districts, etc.) These are completely encyclopedic, and would be a serious concern if had only the 1-year criterion. (If a particular sewage district has been around for 150 years, I suppose it's earned some kind of distinction.) There are going to be some new and messy corner cases, but I guess we'll deal with them when they arise.\n\nIt would be ideal if these were consistently tagged in some way, so that any future reuser who might want to use Wiktionary as a dictionary could filter this junk bright shiny loveliness -- oh, I'll just stick with \"junk\" -- out. -- Visviva\n\nweneedAL ev'm-itsaMASIV PROJECT,wt,so nobigdeal.\n\n[eg acurious girl intheTINIEST OFPLACES needs2beABL2GO2WT'n'FINDOUTwot herhamlet's nameACTUALY MEANS[=etyl!!\n\nmymyself imstilnot sur'bout the engl name4ppl fromthe south ofbelgium[VLOMS-wAAL]--itsNEVA i/thoseOFENSIVLY B-A-D PRINT DICT uguyz solike[n i/encyclop. itgoes byREGION, n even ifu STUMBLE UPONit,itsNOT THEIR JOB,so info INcomplete etc--n let alone FINDIN'THE CHIN.TR-L so idont need2hum-haw here i/tw--iREALY-REALYwish uguyz'dc FURTHER THAN UR NOSES RLONGnDISCOVER [N ACOMODATE!]USERS'NEEDS!!!!![w/o say telin'sumST.SHITbout unprof.tr-lators getin aboost fromaUSERFRIENDLYwt,imeanJEESUS,wotr wedoin here???--史凡>voice-MSN/skypeme!RSI>typin=hard!\n\nA problem with 150 years is demonstrated by that the name of Brasília wouldn't qualify for inclusion under this guideline.\n\nShould prescriptive government documents be added to the list of maps & references? On the other hand, we already accept many technical terms with prescribed definitions, and typically put a restrictive label on them like chemistry, medicine, etc. (Or don't label them: look at the for-physicists-only definition of metre!). —Michael Z. 2009-09-08 16:19 z\n\nI can't think of a good way to objectively define a \"prescriptive government document\". Do treaties and constitutions count as such? Why or why not? --EncycloPetey\n\nI'm just thinking of official lists of place names and their spellings, electoral districts, etc., whose names may not be in general use, or may change or be renamed periodically as governments re-stack the voters' lists. We should go by attested use instead. —Michael Z. 2009-09-09 05:28 z\n\nThe proposal doesn't say what it means by \"citations\". Any use at all? I suspect half the tiny hamlets in Great Britain will meet that criterion (and many elsewhere, such as Colonie (w:)), not that that's necessarily a bad thing.​—msh210℠\n\nOne linguistic criterion in a multilingual dictionary such as ours might be that the place name has attestably a different name in at least two languages, or alternatively in at least one language that is not widely used by nationals of that place. This would automatically exclude \"hamlets\" as they are most likely known in only one language (and pretty unknown in that one, too!), but include important places like London (see Lontoo, Londres, Lundúnir). A foreign spelling is typically something that one would want to look up in a dictionary. This might be combined with other criteria such as \"national capital cities always included\". --Hekaheka\n\nWe don't have such criteria for any other kinds of words. This would just favour place names in colonies and along popular invasion routes. —Michael Z. 2009-09-10 02:00 z\n\nHow do we handle the fact that the identity (which is close to being the definition) of the referent changes. In the first instance, let's ignore formal names of the sovereign states and just focus on an area place name, say, Germany. Writings in different periods would necessarily be referring to the Germany as then or previously constituted. A translation of a Latin work that translated \"Germania\" as \"Germany\" is referring to something different from later definitions of Germany. Many of the referents do correspond to specific borders, but many don't. Are all the Germanies in the set of entities called Germany 1866-1870, 1871-1914, 1918-1938, 1945-reunification, and post unification the same? Note that even this omits the fluidity of the concept during wars and in the years before Bismarck. The referent, that is, seems to be very fluid, which fluidity is usually reflected in the history of the place or the ethnic or national identity involved. Our existing entry for Germany has three definitions and omits many periods. Inevitably, someone will attempt to insert a complete set of definitions of Germany and attempt to cite each one. Because we emphasize attestation from the written record and historians write copiously I don't doubt that many senses will turn out to be citable. DCDuring TALK\n\nWe're talking about criteria for the inclusion of words here, not of the places they represent, and not even of their definitions or senses, so don't steer this conversation too far into the realm of defining.\n\nBut to address your concerns, the word Germany refers to the land of the Germans, and not to a particular set of surveyor's measurements or constitutional documents. —Michael Z. 2009-09-10 02:00 z\n\nThat just pushes the problem elsewhere. What is a \"German\"? Someone who lives in Germany? Well that's no use. Equinox ◑\n\nMaybe not. Germans in this sense are members of an ethnic group, with a shared language. They originally came from elsewhere, but the region they settled in is named after them. Germans in the civic sense, in turn, are people with certain legal rights in Germany.\n\nBut I admit, some dictionaries define these differently. The OED arguably cops out by not defining Germany, even though it says of German (adj) “The precise signification depends on the varying extension given to the name Germany”. —Michael Z. 2009-09-10 02:28 z\n\nWell, it seems circular, but they are basically the same because they have the same name. (Contrast a country that changes its name without changing any geographical borders.) Otherwise couldn't we argue for (deprecated template usage) prime minister having a different, separate referent each time a new one was elected, or (deprecated template usage) cat when a new cross-breed was created? Equinox ◑\n\nThen, which two of the three current definitions of Germany do we strike or how do we rewrite the definition? Do we forbid other definitions?\n\nI would really like to see examples of some model entries for\n\na current place that corresponds to a sovereign jurisdiction, say, Germany\n\na current place that corresponds to a non-sovereign jurisdiction, say, Nice\n\nother inhabited places, say, Cote d'Azur and Hell's Kitchen\n\nother named geographic features (if they are to be included)\n\nAn ocean\n\nA marsh\n\nA valley\n\nA glacier\n\nA plains\n\nAre there any features of these entries as they are that would be excluded? How many senses are to be permitted? How attested? What about maps? Pictures? External links (Official websites, Tourist Bureau, Chamber of Commerce)? Hypernyms; hyponyms; coordinate terms? DCDuring TALK\n\nThis proposal is about inclusion of terms, and not about styles of defining (although we could certainly use some of the latter). —Michael Z. 2009-09-10 02:00 z\n\nOppose. If I cannot know the consequences, then it is a pig in a poke. To the extent that I can foresee the consequences, it appears likely to lead to further dilution of effort to improve quality of existing entries of other types. DCDuring TALK\n\nMust-reads, for those who want to bring in proper names:\n\nSalikoko S. Mufwene (1988) “Dictionaries and Proper Names”[1]\n\nLaurence Urdang (1996) “The Uncommon Use of Proper Names”[2]\n\nBoth argue that there is no logical reason to omit proper names, but the former also says “since proper names function prototypically as referential indices, denotative descriptions beyond, e.g., 'personal name' or 'name of a city in GL' (where GL stands for geographic location) should be omitted.” —Michael Z. 2009-09-24 05:06 z\n\nJust looking at σχολή among other, where do pronunciations for ancient dead languages like this come from? I see them for Latin and for Old French as well. Clearly I'm not against them of they're correct, but what sources can there possibly be there are reliable, unless they were recorded at the time, trying to \"reconstruct\" pronunciations seems very dodgy. Mglovesfun (talk)\n\nI wouldn't think it was noticably more challenging than reconstruction Proto-Indo-European. While they may not be totally accurate, enough information can be obtained from verse (where the meter can imply the pronunciation) etc. to make good enough assumptions. Conrad.Irwin\n\nPronunciation sections for dead languages are, of course, of a different nature than pronunciations for living languages. However, they can be quite reliable. Ancient Greek, specifically, is well suited to fairly precise and confident reconstructions. There are a few things which are used to make such reconstructions, including poetic writings, borrowings, spelling mistakes, and probably a host of other things (phonology has never been my strong suit). Ancient Greek has plenty of all of them, because of its broad historical influence (both temporally and spatially). Our pronunciations are solely based on spellings, but Ancient Greek (especially Classical Greek) was almost certainly spelled based on phonetic principles (instead of etymological principles, as is often the case in English), as its writings came about so soon after the invention of its writing system (a writing system specifically devised for it, which is not the case for many other languages), and was not quite so rife with borrowings as some modern languages are. Later borrowings (e.g. Hebrew names in the Greek New Testament) are probably somewhat less reliable. -Atelaes λάλει ἐμοί\n\nLikewise for Latin. For Classical Latin, there are additional helps in reconstruction beyond the ones Atelaes has mentioned for Greek. Some contemporary grammarians explicitly discuss phonology in clear terms; they compare sounds of different letters within Latin, among dialects, and with Greek. There are writers who bemoan \"mis\"-pronunciations that are common. There are writers who vary their spellings of certain words, thus indicating similarity of sound, and there are plays on words in some comedies that allow for similar analysis.\n\nThere are whole books written on the subject of phonology in Classical Latin, and the best ones (some of which I own) include a discussion of the problems that remain and some of the uncertainties. However, we have a fairly confident picture for most of the sounds, and even an idea concerning elision and other phonological changes that occur in context. The only serious points of contention concern the \"long\" and \"short\" vowels. Continental Classicists tend to favor an interpretation of long vowels as of strictly greater duration but with no change in vowel quality. English Classicists favor the view that at least a couple of the vowels differed in quality (different IPA symbol) in addition to being of longer duration. I've chosen to follow the Continental viewpoint as a result of discussion with Latin specialists on Wikipedia and elsewhere, but I have not seen a coherent data-based argument anywhere that I've looked. The difference in view seems to be largely traditional at this point, so I'm going with the people who speak descendant languages. --EncycloPetey\n\nI don't know about Classical Latin, but certainly for Vulgar Latin there are good data-based arguments that short i and u are qualitatively different from long i and u, namely that in the Western Romance languages at least short i and u merge with long e and o, while long i and u are separate. Anyway, I do think it's feasible to give classical Latin pronunciations for Latin entries, and it wouldn't be amiss to give Italianate/Ecclesiastical Latin pronunciations as well. For Old Irish (the old language I'm working on adding forms of right now), it's harder because it's difficult to know what IPA symbol is most appropriate for certain sounds. But even so, it would be nice to do so, because pronunciation isn't easy to guess from spelling in Old Irish, and sometimes it makes a difference to meaning (for example, ingen (“fingernail”) and ingen (“daughter”) are pronounced differently).

He says he has RSI; that sounds like it's a bitch, but that's just tough. He could do more to aid communication, including acquiring a faster computer to support a dictation program.

And I would like to introduce everyone to a recording of the way that this comes out to a text editor. While I understand that Sven possibly has concerns about accessibility, I wonder if he realises that his writing is literally impossible and therefore not going to be read by anyone with a processing disability, or dyslexia. —Neskaya kanetsv?\n\n(after triple edit conflict) It's RSI, which basically means that one's arm & hands hurts like crazy.

(e.g. only since assisted editing for translations I'm able to contribute there, please continue the good work! :) Your language edits like german translations seem to be OK to me quality-wise (which i hold for no mean feat as you seem mainly monolingual, as many here, per your babel, and thanks for having one! :), and so perhaps it's unfortunate that my \"formal request actually hits you in the back of your neck, me being pushed by continuous ignorant and silly posts from many other editors; only, what I don't get is why what looks like a competent, serious, committed person (all properties very high on my value scale ;) at least seems to keep saying the above refered to (I read your posts, and other people's, over and over again, thinking they'd not be really saying all that, but, as a near-native english speaker who seems to at last have won some or a degree of community approval and respect based on the merit of my entries and not 'cause perhaps i'm actually a nice guy, brown-nose with admins (who'd say that?! :P ) (sense of humor is an asset, i think, though even that is sometimes lost here, also from my side :( ) or, let alone that, 'cause I'm disabled (as I said before, I'm not very convinced about positive discrimination, and didn't invoke it for myself to say the least), approval thus of my work here these nine months, even from what I'd say are rather critical people (which I can be myself, so no first stone from my side here), still, it kept reading, in your case \"We don't help disabled people to function here\", concept which I likely have called accommodate/enable at various stages, assuming that were the proper and precise english words, and which I strongly expected, felt and feel you guys would and should, sure, within reason -- for example I'm not expecting you guys to have speech-to-text at your end as of yet since the software is not so far developed at this stage (who'd have believed in free internet-phoning 20 years ago? I communicate via that technology anno 2009, and thoroughly enjoy it! :p ), so, entry-wise I type everything out as I don't get Dragon Naturally Speaking (my speech recognition program) to run for now on my old beast of a laptop (can't be substandard there, I agree with sgb though about different accuracy-requirement on discussion pages, that exactly was my point all the time, and at least tolerance there seems due in my view (doesn't it feel I'm already and really doing all I can?!) and since it seemed you, Conrad (amidst others admittedly, but since you're a tech-whiz you're key to people like me here, and to WT in general), kept repeating that \"no-help\" statement, I decided to take the \"formal request\"-approach as a means to an end, which is: \"Please help me function here\" -- does it really need to be that i get pushed just that far I'm like now hanging crying for upsetness over my computer to state what I feel is only the very obvious in developed society?! In general in my experienced here I find WT-people very concerned with themselves, but not very thoughtful of their own actions, where I in contrast go by \"give as good as you want and are willing and prepared to get\", which means that if I've been a ass myself somehow, whether unknowingly or on purpose, I find it very much ok for people to tell me, including in an upset way, as long as they make sure to have me see why they feel like that and where i went wrong -- you guys with upset newbies, my gad, you people just block 'em all :( -- I hope that with Logomaniac's help (herculean effort, please let's try for a record button!!) the many nuances in my what has been assessed, to the community's apparent surprise, as actually not that bad English writing (of course it's not, as i told you guys over and again from the very beginning, the Keyboard is the problem!!) will be readily available to be gleaned up in the community's wonted and wanted style-ways, and I really really hope these nine months of avoidable drama will know an ending leading to improvements for me and all the other disabled users, more understanding in the community (I like, nay, loooove understanding things, but, am i the only one thus here?) and better communication -- for the record, I've no personal grudge against anyone on this forum: EncycloPetey (at times the pedanticness, sophistries and fallacies as well as limited outlook on language learning and how dictionaries could and should help in that process are a bit much), SemperBlotto (ignoring can be a lower form of tolerance to give it that twist, and thus not all that bad -- it (ignoring) is supposed to be also a rather rude thing in Flanders like say with friends, but we're mere collaborators here on a world-wide stage, and it's what I asked for myself anyway - to be at least tolerated - and I came across quite a few definitions from you I really liked and looove it when you help me make my entries work, even despite my discussion pages-shorthand!), Conrad (Note I didn't ask for a block which I'd hold for the very last and unconstructive thing to do -- I just like this to get solved and the unnice remarks from the community re my input problem (not \"writing style\"!) to stop; it's really very frustrating that one, me, has to actually ask such, comparable to an overweight person having to implore to please not call him/her fat -- see now what I mean with uncivil??), DCDuring, msh210, Ruakh (please be not so flowery guys, as many non-natives have signaled, like you with me I hardly ever get your meaning, especially DCDuring's) and have to guess), Mglovesfun (Was I un-nice about getting the nl wrong in the entry i made (over de kling jagen)? It was an attempt, and that is what we're here for, but persistingly so not wanting to understand the nature of my problem really gets at me, and keeping deleting useful entries for learners because of some misguided CFI IMHO (and mind it's mostly not my entries, which is irrelevant but the usefulness of WT), especially when just discovering about what goes on at RFD I can get mega-upset about that too) -- I'm firmly convicted we most of the/quite a few times can just agree to disagree, at least ensuring we understanding each other without (w/o - another user used that abbreviation too, so why then come to me and give me an additional hard time about it?) trying to put each other down -- It is normally in my personal experience not a good thing to be in the center of scrutiny (I actually try to avoid the attention Conrad reproached me to seek, and as almost 40 years old i can also do without \"grow up!\" comments really) -- I just wish, since it is now so anyway, my disability, RSI, would be understood, leading to WT be accessible also for disabled people; Furthermore, as said before: I do not think it matters who proposes etc. as long as that happens and wiktionary keeps progressing, so I hope now quite some misunderstandings will get and be out of the way, improving what we can, moving on forwards with a clean slate towards a bright future!!

There are several projects, http://shtooka.net for example, that provide free audio recording software that works on all computers, however I don't believe it would be easy to provide an online \"record\" button. (It is possible in Java, but the browsers security manager normally disables access to the microphone, and while it should be possible in Flash, a quick google turned up nothing useful). Given that the best way to record the audio is a program on the user's computer, the only improvement I can think of would be to make uploading at commons easier (I still find it next to impossible to navigate the endless dialogs), as sounds files are likely to have fairly similar conditions and requirements it might be possible for us to implement a special audio uploader on toolserver, but I can't recall any attempts to do that (at least not just for Wiktionary audio, people do use a photo upload tool). If there is interest in this, I can have a go at it, but as I don't deal much with audio myself I would need a fairly detailed overview of what is required.
