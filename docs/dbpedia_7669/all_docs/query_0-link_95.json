        "text": "Yesterday, we noted proposed changes in public pension accounting rules by GASB, the Governmental Accounting Standards Board. An observation from Academic Council Chair Robert Anderson, added to that blog note, indicated that the GASB proposal would not have a direct impact on UCRP. However, the problem facing UCRP is partly political.\n\nAs prior blog posts have noted, the governor is planning some kind of pension proposals – apparently requiring a ballot proposition. Such a proposition, depending on how it is worded, could sweep UCRP into a statewide change, even though the Regents enacted their own pension modifications in December 2010.\n\nThere is a report today in the Sacramento Bee that the big CalSTRS fund covering schools, whose unfunded liability is already large under current accounting rules, would experience a big jump in its recorded liability:\n\n…The California State Teachers’ Retirement System already faces a funding gap of $56 billion – the difference between the money it expects to have on hand over the next 30 years and what it will need to pay out in benefits during the same period. The (GASB) proposal would triple the gap – on paper – to around $150 billion, said Ed Derman, deputy chief executive officer at CalSTRS…\n\nFull article at: http://www.sacbee.com/2011/10/18/3986621/outlook-goes-from-bad-to-worse.html\n\nAnything that raises the pension issue in the larger state pensions – CalSTRS and CalPERS – could lead indirectly to UCRP changes that go beyond what the Regents enacted. While CalPERS apparently would not be much affected by the GASB proposal, $150 billion at CalSTRS will surely stir things up.\n\nFrom Wiktionary\n\n“bury the lede”\n\n(idiomatic, US, journalism) To begin a story with details of secondary importance to the reader while postponing more essential points or facts.\n\nhttp://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/bury_the_lede\n\n====\n\nAn article in today’s calpensions.com indicates that both CalPERS and CalSTRS have asked GASB – the Governental Accounting Standards Board – for a delay in its proposed new rules on public pension accounting. The rule would allow public pensions such as UCRP to continue with their projections of earnings on their assets (7.5% for UCRP) but would require a much lower discount rate for unfunded liabilities. The net effect of the proposed change would boost the accounting value of unfunded liability.\n\nBuried at the end of the report is an indication that GASB is moving towards doing the same for retiree health care. Note that at UC, as in most public systems, there essentially is no trust fund with assets for retiree health – the system is pay-as-you-go. Hence, everything is unfunded liability. The impact on reported unfunded liability for retiree health would be much bigger than for pensions.\n\nThere is also a final sentence that indicates GASB is looking at “financial projections.” It is not clear to what that phrase refers, but it sure sounds like GASB is looking at whether assumed future earnings rates on assets, e.g., 7.5% for UCRP (and higher at CalPERS and CalSTRS), are too high.\n\nHere are the last few sentences of the article:\n\nOther speakers at the hearing said the new accounting rules should require government employers to report their retiree health debt. The state, for example, owes an estimated $60 billion over the next 30 years for retiree health care. Like most government employers, the state has not set aside money to invest and help pay for retiree health care promised current state workers. The state is paying about $1.5 billion for retiree health care this year, a rapidly growing cost.\n\n“I think I can offer you some hope,” …the GASB chairman, told a speaker. “Dealing with OPEB (other post-employment benefits), primarily retiree health benefits, is something that’s on our agenda. We will be looking at that going forward.”\n\n(He) told another speaker that GASB has “another project that is looking at financial projections.”\n\nFull article at http://calpensions.com/2011/10/17/calpers-calstrs-delay-new-accounting-rules/\n\nUPDATE: Academic Council chair Robert Anderson adds the following note re UCRP via email (in italics below):\n\nThe actual GASB proposal for pensions is to project the liabilities year by year; then project the assets forward, including future contributions according to your actuarial plan (which you must be actually following, not just planning to do at some indefinite point in the future) and your assumed rate of return on assets and see if you ever run out of money. If you do, all liabilities beyond that point are discounted back at a lower rate, most likely a corporate bond or a taxable municipal bond rate. If not, all liabilities are discounted back at the assumed rate of return. We have an actuarial plan that restores us to full funding in 30 years, and we are currently following it, so the new GASB rule on pensions should make no difference to us.\n\nIt would make sense for (GASB) to apply that to retiree health. But note we are already discounting retiree health at (if I recall correctly) 6%, precisely because we are not prefunding it. Thus, I think there would be little change in our retiree health liability. I presume CalPERS and CalSTRS are also currently required to use the lower rate also. Thus, I am not sure it would make much difference.\n\nIn short, the impact on retiree health accounting would depend on whether GASB insisted on a rate below 6%.\n\nAt the Milken Institute State of the State conference today (attended by yours truly), Governor Brown was asked by Michael Milken about public pensions in California. (Cell phone photo of conference event at right.)\n\nBrown indicated he was working on a proposal on pensions – but did not give a precise date when it would be unveiled. He did say that it would involve a constitutional amendment that would have to be approved by a vote of the people.\n\nIt was unclear what the coverage of the pension proposal would be. All state and local pensions in California? Just state-level pensions? Would it include UCRP? If so, would it override what the Regents did to modify the university’s pension system in December 2010?\n\nWhat appears to be the case is that this proposal is still a work in progress. That means that UCOP and the Regents have a chance to weigh in on the proposal before it is completed.\n\nBelow is an audio of what Brown said. (Video with just a still picture.)\n\nUpdate: State Treasurer Bill Lockyer comments at http://blogs.sacbee.com/the_state_worker/2011/10/bill-lockyer-says-pensions-must-be-fiscally-politically-sound.html He notes with regard to the legal obligation to pay earned benefits: “I’m also mindful that judges, too, have been promised their pensions.”\n\nGovernor Brown has been vetoing and signing. Among the vetoes were two that would have made commercial initiative signature gathering more difficult. One was a ban on paying signature gatherers by the signature. They would have then been paid by the hour which would have changed the incentive structure in a way that would have undermined name gathering. In theory, they would have sat in front of supermarkets and watched the clock tick rather than annoy people into signing. And he vetoed another bill that would have required signature gatherers to wear large badges saying they were being paid. Presumably, that would have made signature gathering more difficult since the illusion of a volunteer-for-the-great cause gathering would have been removed.\n\nExactly why the governor did what he did is just one of those Jerry Brown contrarian Zen mysteries. Democrats liked the bills (or they would not have passed). He is a Democrat but he vetoed them. It seems to be something like that. Anyway, from the narrow UC perspective, the vetoes mean that it will be easier for whoever (a whoever with $1-$2 million for signature gathering) to put pension initiatives doing who-knows-what on the ballot. And the who-knows-what could override the Regents’ December 2010 decision on the UC pension. Thanks, Jerry.\n\nThe governor vetoed a bill related to CalPERS survivor benefits saying action on pensions should be part of some larger pension reform. What that is will presumably be revealed in the weeks to come.\n\nThere remains the issue of when stuff might get on the ballot. Normally, initiatives that have the needed signatures are put on the next available election. The first statewide election will be the presidential primary. Since there is little mystery about who the Democratic nominee for president will be, the primary will turn out Republicans. (On the other hand, the primary is being put back to June so by that time the Republican nominee might well be known.) On the assumption that the primary will tilt toward Republicans, legislative Dems are pushing a bill that would put initiatives on the November ballot instead. We will have to see how that turns out. Yours truly is traveling at the moment and not fully up-to-date on this matter.\n\nThe governor did sign the bill making university fundraising foundations more “transparent.” See earlier blog posts on that issue.\n\nRegent-designate David Crane – a late appointment by Gov. Schwarzenegger who has yet to be confirmed (or not) by the state senate – has pushed various versions of pension reform.\n\nIn an op ed today in the Sacramento Bee, he seems to be appealing to the current governor. Whether that will carry any weight in the state senate is not clear. Basically, he wants a “Grand Bargain” on a corporate tax change – which Gov. Brown has pushed – in exchange for pension reform.\n\nCrane says nothing specifically about the UC pension, however. Is he just talking about CalPERS and CalSTRS in his op ed? Or does he now accept the Regents’ pension changes made last December? We have yet to hear.\n\nExcerpt from the op ed:\n\nRecently Gov. Jerry Brown rightfully proposed a change to California’s corporate tax that would boost both job prospects and state revenue. That’s right, a tax increase that would also be good for in-state jobs. In brief, the change would make the “single-sales-factor” method of corporate taxation, enacted into law in 2009, mandatory instead of elective. Unfortunately Republican legislators have already thrown cold water on Brown’s proposal, presumably because it would violate an ideological stand against tax increases. But there’s a more productive path available to them that would be good for both budgets and jobs: demand real pension reform in exchange for the tax increase.\n\nFull op ed at: http://www.sacbee.com/2011/09/04/3881582/a-grand-bargain-tax-hike-pension.html"
