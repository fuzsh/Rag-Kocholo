        "text": "As a teen, Schwarzenegger spent three hours a day in the gym\n\nSchwarzenegger said his interest in bodybuilding began early in his life when he became fascinated by muscular icons like Reg Park. As a young teen, he tagged along with a crowd of weightlifters and wrestlers who hung out at a local lake.\n\nMany of them trained at a weightlifting gym called Athletic Union in Graz, Austria, which Schwarzenegger joined so he could work out, too.\n\n\"I could train, finally, with the big boys,\" he said. \"This weightlifting club became, for me, the mecca. I became addicted to that, so I went every day.\"\n\nSchwarzenegger said he would write on the wooden wall of the gym with a piece of chalk, marking down a line for each set he performed for each body part, such as biceps, triceps, chest, and back.\n\nThe workout would be finished once he performed 20 sets of exercises for each, such as bicep curls and bench flies, to build a physique like those of his idols.\n\n\"Now after three hours of training, this whole thing would be full of sets that I've done to get to that goal,\" he said.\n\nA mentor told Schwarzenegger his biceps were too big compared to his calves\n\nAll the training paid off, and Schwarzenegger began winning competitions and being noticed by big names in international bodybuilding. He was eventually invited to work out and compete in London, at which point his focus on building a massive upper body backfired.\n\nRelated stories\n\nOne of his early mentors, bodybuilding trainer Wag Bennett, complained that Schwarzenegger needed to work on a balanced physique by developing his legs more, since his calves were dwarfed by his biceps.\n\n\"The calves are skinny, and the whole proportion is off,\" Schwarzenegger said. \"If you want to win, you need to be fine-tuned, and you have to have everything at ten.\"\n\nSchwarzenegger took Bennett's advice, and it paid off, earning him first place in the Mr. Universe contest in 1967.\n\nHe lost the 1968 Mr. Universe competition in America because he had too much body fat\n\nFollowing his Mr. Universe win, Schwarzenegger attracted the attention of Joe Weider, the \"godfather of bodybuilding\" who had his own version of the competition in Miami.\n\nConfident he could win, Schwarzenegger said he was devastated and embarrassed when the judges called his name for second place. Instead, the top title went to American bodybuilder Frank Zane, who said in the docuseries that Schwarzenegger had plenty of mass, but wasn't lean enough to be a first-place winner.\n\n\"He was acting so arrogant and cocky like he was the winner, but he wasn't in shape. It was all about being big and you know, size with him,\" Zane said in the docuseries.\n\nSchwarzenegger said he then traveled to Los Angeles to work with elite bodybuilders and trainers, who told him he had potential, but needed to get rid of a lot of body fat.\n\nJoe Gold, the owner of Gold's Gym, even called him \"balloon belly,\" according to Schwarzenegger.\n\nSchwarzenegger said he's never been a 'fanatic' about his diet or counted calories\n\nAfter being advised to slim down, Schwarzenegger changed his eating habits, but has previously said he never counted calories.\n\n\"I was never a fanatic about diet,\" he said in the docuseries.\n\nInstead, Schwarzenegger said he made sure to get plenty of protein and would start eating later in the day to lose weight.\n\nHe said his training partners, Franco Columbu and former rival Zane, also helped him get into supplements, including a regimen of vitamins and supplements.\n\nHe \"experimented with\" steroids but said it was only a small part of his overall fitness plan\n\nBut vitamins weren't the only thing giving Schwarzenegger a boost during his pro era â€” he said he also \"experimented with\" steroids. He said the cycles lasted for fours months a year with a doctor's supervision and strict rules.\n\n\"Everybody in the bodybuilding field who is up there on the top is taking steroids,\" Schwarzenegger said in a clip of an earlier interview featured in the docuseries. \"Maybe 5% of my progress is from the steroids.\""
