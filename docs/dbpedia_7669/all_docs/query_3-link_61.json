        "text": "Arnold Alois Schwarzenegger (born July 30, 1947) is an Austrian-American actor, producer, director, activist, businessman, investor, writer, philanthropist, former professional bodybuilder and politician who played Dutch in the 1987 film Predator. He later lent his voice and likeness to the character in the 2020 video game Predator: Hunting Grounds. Other notable films Schwarzenegger has appeared in include Pumping Iron (1977), Conan the Barbarian (1982), The Running Man (1987), Total Recall (1990), True Lies (1994), The 6th Day (2000) and The Expendables trilogy (2010-2014). He is perhaps best-known for playing the titular cyborg in the Terminator franchise (1984-). Aside from his work in film, Schwarzenegger has had an extensive career in television.\n\nSchwarzenegger has won a Golden Globe and an Emmy. For his role in Predator, he was nominated for a Saturn Award for Best Actor. He is considered an icon of action cinema and starred in numerous big-budget Hollywood action films during the 1980s and 1990s. He has also had a political career; he served two terms as the 38th Governor of California from 2003 until 2011. Schwarzenegger was nicknamed the \"Austrian Oak\" in his bodybuilding days, \"Arnie\" during his acting career, and \"The Governator\" (a portmanteau of \"Governor\" and \"The Terminator\" – one of his best-known movie roles) since the start of his political career.\n\nAwards and Nominations[]\n\nYear Film Notes 1987 Predator Nominated — Saturn Award for Best Actor\n\nFilmography[]\n\nYear Title Notes 1969 Hercules in New York 1973 The Long Goodbye Uncredited 1974 Happy Anniversary and Goodbye 1976 Stay Hungry With R.
