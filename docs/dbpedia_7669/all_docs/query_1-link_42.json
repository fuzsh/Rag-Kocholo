        "text": "Norah O'Donnell: Hillary Clinton called you the king of debt.\n\nDonald Trump: Well, no she didn't call me, I called myself the king of debt. I'm the king of debt. I'm great with debt, nobody knows debt better than me. I made a fortune by using debt. And if things don't work out I renegotiate the debt, I mean that's a smart thing not a stupid thing. And I made a fortune.\n\nO'Donnell: How do you renegotiate the debt?\n\nTrump: Because you go back and you say, hey, guess what, the economy just crashed, I'm going to give you back half. I like debt for me, I don't like debt for the country. I like debt for my company, but I don't like debt for the country. For the country we have $19 trillion in debt, it's going to be very soon $21 trillion, not billion, $21 trillion in debt. And I will tell you we are sitting on a time bomb and Hillary Clinton doesn't have a clue. And President Obama has pretty much doubled the debt since he's been in office and somebody's going to pay a big price. We have to start chopping that debt down.\n\nO'Donnell: Janet Yellen, who you know, the chairman of the Federal Reserve blasted you for saying that the U.S. could load up on debt and then make a deal with creditors if the economy has soured. She said there would be very severe consequences if an elected president tried to renegotiate the nation's debt.\n\nTrump: I wouldn't renegotiate the debt.\n\nIn an interview with CBS This Morning' Norah O'Donnell, , quoted in \"CBS' Norah O'Donnell Challenges Trump On His Economic Plan\", Media Matters for America, 22 June 2016\n\nQ: Very simple question; does the buck stop with you? And on a scale of 1 to 10, how would you rate your response to this crisis?\n\nDonald Trump: I'd rate it a 10. I think we've done a great job. And it started with the fact that we kept a very highly infected country, despite all of the—even the professionals saying no, it's too early to do that, we were very, very early with respect to China. And we would have a whole different situation in this country if we didn't do that. I would rate it a very, very—I would rate ourselves and—and the professionals—I think the professionals have done a fantastic job.\n\nCoronavirus task force press briefing, , quoted in Ian Schwartz (16 March 2020), \"Trump: I'd Rate My Response To Coronavirus a 10\", RealClearPolitics\n\nTrump undermines the free press because he wants to be the only legitimate source of information in society. He lies all the time to break down the processes by which we discern the truth about the world around us, and compile the observations and facts which make up the tapestry of reality. He has exposed the paper-thin vulnerability of our democratic society, which depends mightily on observing social norms—like yielding to shame—and a shared acceptance of some common set of truths.\n\nThe American president is determined to bulldoze this architecture of social structures, and usher in an era where force, not deliberation and cooperation, determines the path our society will take. If he never acknowledges any truth besides his own, he never has to do anything outside his own direct interests. He does not have to actually respond to any kind of criticism, or ever reconsider his course of action. Relentless lying, after all, is a form of coercion, in which you bend others to your will by forcing them to accept the infrastructure of your false reality—or to give up caring whether anything is true or false in the first place. Don't believe your eyes and ears. Everybody was cheering for me.\n\nJack Holmes, Politics editor at Esquire.com, \"Donald Trump's Press Conference With Theresa May Would Not Be Complete Without an Assault on Truth\", Esquire.com (June 4, 2019)\n\nThis young girl, Tara Conner, how old is she? 20? 21. She went out and she was partying. She's from Kentucky. She went to New York and she was hanging out at all the parties, and doing what Paris and Lindsay do — you know, dancing, whatever. And so he held a press conference to announce whether or not she was going to retain her crown. And then she started to cry, going, \"I just want to thank Donald for giving me a second chance.\" And there he is, hair looping, going [flipping hair over top of her head, imitating Trump] \"Everyone deserves a second chance. I'm going to give her a second chance.\"\n\nHe annoys me on a multitude of levels. He's the moral authority? Left the first wife, had an affair. Left the second wife, had an affair. Had kids both times, but he's the moral compass for 20-year-olds in America. Donald, sit and spin, my friend! I don't enjoy him. No. No, no, no."
