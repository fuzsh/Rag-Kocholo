        "text": "Discussion moved from WT:BP#new competition.\n\nHi. I'm releasing Wiktionary:Easter Competition 2010 to the public. It should start tomorrow, but I'm not sure if the rules are clear, so please look at it and discuss. The goal of it is to get more cites into Wiktionary, and get people to follow one of my typical edit patterns (find something to read, weed out phrases that aren't in Wikt, add them to Wikt). --Rising Sun talk? contributions\n\nI personally consider a bit unfair the fact that I lately created various Portuguese words, therefore they wouldn't be worth 15 points anymore. :) Nonetheless, the rules are quite clear to me and the game is likely to be fun. I'm playing it. --Daniel.\n\nCan an (deprecated template usage) opus mean a (deprecated template usage) website for the uses of this competition? I add about a dozen words most days from arXiv. SemperBlotto\n\nNo, a website is not an opus...imagine \"i found it on google\". --Rising Sun talk? contributions\n\nDoes the First Folio count as an opus? If so, I'm calling it. If not, I have other ridiculous choices I could use. --EncycloPetey\n\nNope, that folio is comprised of several books. Sorry --Rising Sun talk? contributions\n\nDoes The Lord of the Rings count as an opus? It tells one story. (and I have the Lord of the Rings compiled in one single book) --Daniel.\n\nI can say the same of the \"First Folio\", so presumably not. But someone should clarify, since Widsith has chosen The Faerie Quene, which I believe was also published originally in more than one volume, but can now be found as a single \"book\". I'd like to know what is meant by \"book\" and whether it applies to \"original\" publication; Ovd's Metamorphoses was originally published in XV \"books\" (scrolls) by virtue of the differences in ppublication limitations, but nearly all extant copies exist as a single or double volume work rather than as 15 tiny chapter books. This would also affect people's choices when it comes to Dickens, whose novels were originally published in smaller installments in newspapers. --EncycloPetey\n\nFaerie Queene (and Metamorphoses) is a single work, I don't think it's the same as Shakespeare's plays which were gathered together only later as a kind of compendium. Ƿidsiþ\n\nThe same is true of Stephen King's The Gunslinger (Dark Tower, volume 1). It was originally published as a series of short stories, then later compliled as volume 1 of his \"single work\" magnus opus (in seven ever-more-lengthy volumes). So, I want clarification before I begin, lest I have to change works. I'm considering Ovid's Metamorphoses, Schuster's Hepaticae and Anthocerotae of North America East of the Hundredth Meridian (all six volumes), Leitgeb's Untersuchungen der Lebemoose, Grzimek's Animal Life Encyclopedia (volume 1), Arnold Schwarzenegger's New Encyclopedia of Modern Bodybuilding, or something along those lines. (It's unlikely that people would \"steal\" quotes from me if I chose one of those works.) However, I have to know what constitutes a \"single opus\" since Jerome's Vulgate Bible, although produced and published as one work, is a translation of more than 70 items originally written separately by many authors over an extended period. --EncycloPetey\n\nThe Lord of the Rings counts, yes. If not only because I fricking love it. But also because it's sequential --Rising Sun talk? contributions\n\nGood. :) I also like that series very much. But since sequential stories are allowed, I'll strategically choose Harry Potter. Thanks for this clarification. --Daniel.\n\nBut I don't like Harry Potter. Damn, you made a fool of me. --Rising Sun talk? contributions\n\nNo problem. You may consider creating a list of everything you like for purposes of delimiting rules. But if you do it, please do it when hosting another competition. I like how Harry Potter quotations are converted to game points right now. --Daniel.\n\nThe competitve element is at odds with the statement in the rules that a player must add from a single opus. --EncycloPetey\n\ntrue, this concerned me. Any suggestions of how to make it more competitive? --Rising Sun talk? contributions\n\nI have a suggestion:\n\n\"It is also possible to use opuses chosen by other editors. 3 points are won for each new citation from another competitor's opus, with 3 more for adding a new definition, and 3 more for creating a brand new entry.\" --Daniel.\n\nOK. yoink --Rising Sun talk? contributions\n\nDoes a \"form of\" line count as a \"definition\", or is the contest limited to lemmata? --EncycloPetey\n\nSure, form ofs are allowed. --Rising Sun talk? contributions\n\nCan we double-dip using the same quote for both a lemma and a form-of? —Internoob (Disc•Cont)\n\nNah, I don't like that idea, denied --Rising Sun talk? contributions\n\nIs it retroactive? I've been doing exactly this with every book I've read for the last four years. Ƿidsiþ\n\nI'm thinking...should I demand a translation for non-English entries? --Rising Sun talk? contributions\n\nPlease, do not - in the case of Don Quixote, finding a copyright free English translation is a piece of cake, but there are innumerable opera in other languages which have never been translated in English, including most of my favourite Russian authors such as Rozanov, Meščerskij or Leontiev. The uſer hight Bogorm converſation\n\ndenied. In this case, please, add a translation. I'm perfectly happy with your own translation. You never know, you might find you're good at it, and get rich off translating Rozanov. --Rising Sun talk? contributions\n\nDon't the rules say \"new definition\"? \"new translation\" doesn't get a mention (but I think this should be changed for our Portuguese friend). SemperBlotto\n\nA definition, in wiktionary terms, is another # line. So, in this case, yes, I can bend the rules. Of course, verb forms are still allowed in this case. --Rising Sun talk? contributions\n\n\"The opus must be the same in all cases, and not a translation.\" Please clarify this statement. Examples would be appreciated. --Daniel.\n\nK, if one user chooses War and Peace, then another user can't take bonus points (the 3 points) for adding citations from Война и мир. --Rising Sun talk? contributions\n\nI'm perfectly happy with one user chosing Война и мир as his opus, and another choosing War and Peace. --Rising Sun talk? contributions\n\nSo, this business with Don Quixote is perfectly acceptable, because they were chosen as the main opus by 2 different users. --Rising Sun talk? contributions\n\nI'm not really into this competition, but by pretty much coincidence I added two citations from a s:fr:Érec et Énide today. Can I claim them retrospectively, even though I haven't actually entered the competition yet? fruit is one (author not tagged in citation, yet). Mglovesfun (talk)\n\nSure you can. Don't spend too long counting points or keeping the running total up to date, though. --Rising Sun talk? contributions\n\nDo alternative forms, spellings and inflected forms also count for 5, 10 and 15 respectively? Maybe they shouldn't. But maybe they should. See my (deprecated template usage) vangier. Mglovesfun (talk)\n\nSure, they're just as valid as anything else. --[[User:Rising Sun|Rising Sun]] [[User talk:Rising Sun|talk?]] [[Special:Contributions/Rising_Sun|contributions]] 15:56, 3 April 2010 (UTC)\n\nIf more than one definition is added to a single entry, does each additional definition count? See repeated, where I have found a quote that uses this word as an adjective in two different senses. --EncycloPetey\n\nGreat. I might have to look into that particular entry later, but it's valid under my rules --Rising Sun talk? contributions\n\nThe rules say there are \"20 bonus points for each week (7-day period, start time irrelevant) in which no rival players add any other quotes from the chosen opus\". I think what's meant is \"20 bonus points for each week (7-day period, start time irrelevant) in which no rival players add any other quotes from the chosen opus, where no two such weeks overlap\", right?​—msh210℠"
