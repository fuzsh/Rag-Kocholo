        "text": "WHICH BLAIR PROJECTED?\n\nAccording to the Daily Express newspaper, an offer has been made to former Prime Minister Tony Blair to make a cameo appearance in an episode of 'Doctor Who' during the upcoming fourth season.\n\nBlair has already appeared in an episode of 'The Simpsons' (animated, natch), and in a sketch with once and future 'Who' Companion Catherine Tate.\n\nHowever, from a Toobworld perspective, his participation in the series wouldn't make sense. Since RTD took over 'Doctor Who', it has been firmly established to be taking place in an alternate TV dimension. As the audience, it was our perspective that changed sometime between the 1996 TV movie and the re-launch of the series in 2005. (Perhaps due to the Time War?)\n\nThe adventures of the Doctor in the universe of Earth Prime-Time, the main Toobworld, would probably be the same as those we've been watching, except that the Slitheen never destroyed Big Ben, Harriet Jones never became Prime Minister, and (hopefully) Arnold Schwarzenegger never becomes the President of the United States.\n\nAdd another to that list: in the main Toobworld, Tony Blair is still alive. Over in the TV dimension where the \"nu-Who\" takes place, he's been dead since the \"Aliens In London\"/\"World War Three\" two-parter. As far as Toobworld Central is concerned, that was Tony Blair whose body tumbled out of the closet at Number 10 Downing Street.\n\nSo if Tony Blair was to appear as himself, the perspective of the show would have to switch back to the main TV universe. And I don't think that's about to happen while RTD is in charge. He's created his own little sandbox in which he can create whatever scenarios he chooses, even if his vision of Life today doesn't reflect the world in which we actually live.\n\nIf I was Tony Blair - well, first I'd probably roger Cherie before anybody got wise to the deception, just to say I did. But then I'd tell RTD that I'd be happy to appear on 'Doctor Who'... just as soon as he was no longer in charge of the production.\n\nAs good a revenge as any for killing off Blair's televersion on a show his own kids were sure to be watching.....\n\nJust sayin', is all.....\n\nBCnU!\n\nToby OB\n\nTOOBWORLD TIDDLY WINKS*\n\nSome items of interest for Toobworld in the last week, mostly from the TCA madness in California......\n\nSnoop Dogg will be on the new episode of 'Monk' tonight. Last Sunday he met E and Vince in that night's episode of 'Entourage'. In the past he's appeared as himself on 'Las Vegas', 'Player$', 'Weeds', 'Martin', 'The Tracy Morgan Show', 'The Steve Harvey Show', and 'Just Shoot Me'.\n\nAdd to all of that his work in blipverts for Chrysler, T-Mobile, Orbit gum, AOL 9.0, and a Dutch cell phone company and you have somebody more than ready to kick it in the Hall.\n\n¶\n\nIt was announced during the CBS sessions at the TCA death march that there will be a crossover next season between 'CSI' and 'Without A Trace'.\n\nAs 'Without A Trace' operates in the general tri-state area around New York City, I'd rather see that show cross over with 'CSI: NY'.\n\nBut what do I know?\n\n¶\n\n“CSI” and “CSI: NY” will have crossover episodes on the same night in which William Petersen and Gary Sinise visit each other’s hometowns.\n\nThis will make Gary Sinise's character Mac Taylor eligible for the TV Crossover Hall of Fame.\n\n¶\n\nAmy Sedaris says that Jerri Blank and the other characters from Flatpoint High on 'Strangers With Candy' would take up temporary residence in Springfield is she got her way for the 500th episode of 'The Simpsons'.\n\n\"I think we might be talking about plotlines involving baby farms, crystal meth labs, a prostitution ring or two, a food poisoning epidemic caused by the sale of off-brand Girl Scout cookies made illegally in Manchuria... Fun stuff like that.\"\n\nShe claims that Groening woud be \"moist as a snack cake\" after he reads her draft proposal.\n\n¶\n\nOn August 6th, Alan Thicke will return to 'The Bold & The Beautiful' as talk-show host Rich Ginger. Any chance he changed his name from Dennis Dupree, the character played by Thicke on 'Hope & Gloria'?\n\n¶\n\nJerry Seinfeld will appear in the season opener of '30 Rock' as himself, making him another celebrity ready for membership in the TV Crossover Hall of Fame.\n\nAny mentions of his hit TV show will not be a Zonk. He made a sitcom in Toobworld called 'Jerry' and it could be he made another one called 'Seinfeld' after being released from prison. Enough time has passed for the normal shelf life of any hit sitcom.....\n\nBCnU!\n\nToby OB\n\n*A title in remembrance of Connecticut radio/tv legend Bob Steele....\n\n#1900: CHARLES LANE - WHAT MIGHT HAVE BEEN\n\nIn writing up my Hat Squad tribute to Charles Lane, I mentioned my surprise at all of the shows in which he never appeared. He was on 'Maude', but why not 'All In The Family'? He was in an episode of 'Rhoda' and two of 'Lou Grant', so how come they couldn't find a role for him on 'The Mary Tyler Moore Show'? (It will be a Toobworld contention from now on however that Charles Lane played Mayr's uncle, General Richards, on an episode of 'Gomer Pyle USMC'.)\n\nI'm not saying that there were already established roles in other shows which would have been better served by the participation of Charles Lane. I don't want to second-guess the producers as to why they never hired him for their shows. I'm just pointing out the programs where he would have been at home. This will be a bit o' \"wish-craft\". In other Toobwords, I'm just sayin', is all....\n\nUnfortunately for the late Mr. Lane, I'm a prisoner of preconceived perceptions. Even though I know he hated his typecasting, I see him only as those irascible skinflints and bureaucrats he portrayed over the years.\n\nFrom the New York Times:\n\nHis bony physique, craggy face and the authoritarian or supercilious way he would peer through his spectacles at his fellow actors eventually led to his being typecast and locked into playing a succession of lawyers, judges, assorted lawmen and other abrasive roles. It was, he said in an interview, “stupid and unfair” to be called upon to play the same kinds of roles over and over again.\n\n“It didn’t give me a chance,” he said. But, he added, “it made the casting easier for the studio.”\n\nAt the same time, that typecasting may have provided him with far more work than he otherwise might have had if he did not have such an enduring image. So even though these suggestions would have reinforced his typecasting, I for one would have been happy for the chance to see more of him.\n\n'ARCHIE BUNKER'S PLACE' & 'CHEERS'\n\nThese are two shows in which Mr. Lane could have been a regular bar patron. On 'Archie Bunker's Place', Bill Quinn probably already covered the bases as an elderly patron with his role as the blind Mr. Van Rensselear. And 'Cheers' had several elderly barflies in Al and Phil.\n\nBut Charles Lane could have added the bitters to the mix, and he would have given Carla as good as she gave out.\n\n(By the way, Bill Quinn played Mary Richards' dad, Doctor Walter Reed Richards, so if I'm going to claim that Mr. Lane was her uncle as General Richards on 'Gomer Pyle, USMC', that means he and Quinn would have been playing brothers.)\n\n'ALL IN THE FAMILY'\n\nMany actors played several roles on 'All In The Family' over the years, so if Mr. Lane played a role in the earlier series, he could have still gone on to play a patron at Archie's bar.\n\nI find it hard to believe he never did appear on 'All In The Family'; I can almost picture him as having done so. He would have been perfect as some bureaucrat locking horns with Archie Bunker; perhaps as the HR director down at the warehouse.\n\n'BATTLESTAR GALACTICA'\n\nIf he had appeared on the original series, Mr. Lane might have been one of the sires of the council. But he would have fit in better on the sequel 'Galactica 1980', once they reached Earth. (Perhaps as a motel clerk who rents a room to Dillon and Troy.)\n\nHad he appeared on the revamped version, a story reflecting the issues of the today on Earth could have involved him in a debate about age; whether it should be a factor in deciding who qualified for precious space during the evacuation.\n\n'MONK'\n\nHe could have been in the nursing home mystery episode, hopefully as a witness rather than as the victim. But I could also see him as Monk's grandfather, with the same traits!\n\n'DEEP SPACE NINE' & 'BABYLON 5'\n\nA little bit of forehead makeup and voila! An elderly alien on board either one of those space stations.\n\n'JULIA'\n\nHe could have been a medical colleague for Doctor Chegley, perhaps even a bigoted one who finally sees the error of his ways thanks to Julia.\n\n'GET SMART II'\n\nThis would have been an obvious one - they should have brought hm in to reprise his role as Uncle Abner, Great Uncle Abner to Zack Smart.\n\n'ALIAS SMITH AND JONES'\n\nI see him as either a bank manager or maybe as the representative of the company that manufactured the Brooker 404 safe.\n\n'IT TAKES A THIEF' & 'BANACEK'\n\nHe would have worked well as an insurance investigator who tangled/worked with Alexander Mundy or Thomas Banacek in the past.\n\n'BATMAN'\n\nMy Bat-idea? Charles Lane as the first criminal Batman ever collared in Gotham City.\n\n'HAZEL'\n\nA role here would be something similar to the eight he played on 'Bewitched': as a man Mr. Baxter is working for, whose acerbic nature is softened by the rough charms of Hazel.\n\n'THE DANNY THOMAS SHOW'\n\nI see him as a friend/adversary of Uncle Tonoose.\n\n'THE HONEYMOONERS'\n\nProbably he'd work best as an official at the bus company, one that could put the fear of God into Ralph, but the show already had George O. Petrie to fill similar roles over the years.\n\n'LASSIE'\n\nBuilding off that image of him as Farmer Frisby on 'The Andy Griffith Show', Mr. Lane could have been some reclusive hermit who learns to open up and be friendly again thanks to the collie.\n\n'VOYAGE TO THE BOTTOM OF THE SEA'\n\nAs either a senator, or admiral or perhaps a paper-pusher from the Nelson Oceanographic Institute.\n\n'COLUMBO'\n\nThere were plenty of episodes in which the story was padded out by Columbo's diversions for bureaucratic details - getting permits, having his driving skills rated, stalling a gun practice test. Mr. Lane could have been a bureaucratic functionary in any one of those types of scenes - so long as Vito Scotti didn't grab it first!\n\nHere are a few other shows I'd have enjoyed seeing him in:\n\n'THE ROCKFORD FILES'\n\n'THE WHITE SHADOW'\n\n'HILL STREET BLUES'\n\n'NORTHERN EXPOSURE'\n\n'thirtySOMETHING'\n\n'THE DICK VAN DYKE SHOW'\n\nFinally, with this show there could have been an actual crossover! Mr. Lane could have played one of his many roles from 'Bewitched' here, where he would have been the new advertiser for 'The Alan Brady Show' and the writing staff needed to impress him.\n\nIt's all wishful thinking now, and Charles Lane has such a substantive body of work already to enjoy. But it's like eating peanuts - no matter how many you have, you always want more when they're gone.\n\nOnce again, thanks for all that you contributed to TV and the movies, Mr. Lane. May God bless......\n\nBCnU!\n\nToby OB\n\n[My 1900th post to this blog]\n\nCROSSING \"ZONE\": MAYBERRY LANE\n\nFollowing the death of character actor Charles Lane last week, I discovered that I could use one of his characters to further strengthen the theoretical link I made between 'The Andy Griffith Show' and an episode of 'The Twilight Zone'.\n\nMr. Lane played Farmer Frisby in the eleventy-first episode of 'The Andy Griffith Show', \"Aunt Bee The Crusader\". Frisby was the butter-and-eggs man for the Taylor household, who often made his rounds with his pet rooster, Beauregard. When he let on to Aunt Bee that his farm was being taken away from him in order to make room for a new highway, Aunt Bee led a protest march to block construction.\n\nDuring his attempts to restore the peace, Andy discovered that Farmer Frisby had about six moonshine stills in operation under his henhouse! (Frisby was betrayed by a drunk chicken.) Once Aunt Bee got wind of what was going on, she dropped the crusade and the highway went through.\n\nHaving no place left to go, Farmer Frisby probably moved in with his brother. It's my contention that Frisby had an older brother (by one year) who lived over in Pitchville Flats, North Carolina. Somerset Frisby ran the local gas station, but he was more at home around the cracker barrel in the general store, telling his tall tales.\n\nUnfortunately for Frisby, alien visitors who had no conception of falsehoods heard his stories as well, and they believed them to be true. Recognizing Frisby as perhaps the greatest intellect of the planet Earth, they decided to take him back with them to their home planet. Had it not been for Frisby's trusty harmonica, which delivered a noise unbearable to the aliens, Frisby might have ended up yet another UFO abductee from Toobworld.\n\nAlso living in Pitchville Flats was a man named Mitchell, who apparently was the identical cousin of the Mayberry barber, Floyd Lawson. (It could be that they were identical half-brothers, if Floyd's father was a \"ramblin' man\".)\n\nBy the way, one of those aliens took such a liking to the architecture of Mayberry, North Carolina, that he reconstructed the entire town on a Class M planet inhabited by humanoids. (Evidence of this can be seen in the 'Star Trek' episode \"Miri\".)\n\n'The Andy Griffith Show': \"Aunt Bee The Crusader\"\n\n'The Twilight Zone': \"Hocus Pocus And Frisby\"\n\nBCnU!\n\nToby OB"
