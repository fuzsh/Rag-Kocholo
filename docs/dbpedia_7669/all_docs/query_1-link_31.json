        "text": "Today, January 22, marks the birth of Robert E. Howard (1906-1936). In observance, I’m going to look at “The House of Arabu”. I read it in The Horror Stories of Robert E. Howard. It will be reprinted in Renegade Swords from DMR Books later this year. Look for it. I’ll have an announcement when more details about Renegade Swords are released, details such as the publication date.\n\nI don’t know when “The House of Arabu” was written. It wasn’t published until 1952 in The Avon Fantasy Reader #18 under the title “The Witch From Hell’s Kitchen”. I like Howard’s original title much better. The story has been reprinted several times, but it isn’t as well known as much of Howard’s other sword and sorcery. I did notice that the version reprinted in The Ultimate Triumph had a slightly different closing line than the version in The Horror Stories of Robert E. Howard.\n\nThe story is set in Mesopotamia. The protagonist is a mercenary from Scandinavia named Pyrrhas. He’s in charge of the defenses for the city where the story takes place.\n\nYes, he’s a brooding barbarian.\n\nThere is a curse on Pyrrhas. In his attempt to try and find the source, he visits an evil sorcerer, takes a goddess captive, and fights a demon in the realm of the dead. There’s plenty of intrigue and action. It’s a solid S&S adventure, and it’s done well.\n\nI suspect, and this is just a guess, that “The House of Arabu” predates Conan. The story could almost be a Conan story with the serial numbers filed off. Almost. The real-world setting doesn’t quite work as well as the Hyborian Age does. The character of Pyrrhas isn’t as well developed as some of Howard’s other characters. He’s not quite a Clonan.\n\nAnd I think that that might be the reason this story might not be familiar to the casual Howard fan. Pyrrhas is not Conan. But you can see traces of Conan there. The prose is good, but it’s not A-game Howard. It’s as though Howard has an inkling, no, a firm idea, of what he’s trying to do. He’s just not quite at that level yet.\n\nFrankly, if this tale were written before Howard created Conan, I don’t understand why he didn’t recycle it into a Conan story. It would have been a solid entry into the series with just a little tweaking. And while not rising to the level of, say, “The People of the Black Circle” or “Beyond the Black River”, it would certainly be an improvement on “The Vale of Lost Women”.\n\nIf you’ve got a copy of “The House of Arabu”, give it a read. If not, then be patient. As I stated above, DMR Books is going to reprint it later this year in Renegade Swords, which will be an anthology featuring lesser known works by some big names in the field. Look for it."
