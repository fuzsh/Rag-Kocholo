Darkly colored, bitter, and slightly acidic, coffee has a stimulating effect on humans, primarily due to its caffeine content. It has the highest sales in the world market for hot drinks.\n\nSeeds of the Coffea plant's fruits are separated to produce unroasted green coffee beans. The beans are roasted and then ground into fine particles that are typically steeped in hot water before being filtered out, producing a cup of coffee. It is usually served hot, although chilled or iced coffee is common. Coffee can be prepared and presented in a variety of ways (e.g., espresso, French press, caffè latte, or already-brewed canned coffee). Sugar, sugar substitutes, milk, and cream are often used to mask the bitter taste or enhance the flavor.\n\nCaffeine is a stimulant that can be found in many beverages including coffee, tea, energy drinks, and soda. Many people rely on this stimulant to increase their energy and alertness\n\nWhat is Coffee Buzz Club in youtube?\n\nCaffeine is a stimulant that can be found in many beverages including coffee, tea, energy drinks, and soda.
