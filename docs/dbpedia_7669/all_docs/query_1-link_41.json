A native speaker would use it to describe how use a a key that doesn't quite fit into a lock. This means that the key must be moved around a bit inside the lock until it lines up correctly (and allows you to unlock the door.) In other words, \"you have to jimmy the lock.\"\n\nMore generally, some people could use it to describe a door that is too big for the frame and needs to be forced slightly to open; \"In the Summer all the wood in this place swells up, so you will have to jimmy the door.\"\"\n\n- https://www.ineteconomics.org/perspectives/blog/from-long-covid-odds-to-lost-iq-points-ongoing-threats-you-dont-know-about"
