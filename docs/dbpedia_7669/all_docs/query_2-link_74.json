        "text": "This year’s presidential election could have been much different.\n\nArnold Schwarzenegger tells Adweek that he wishes he could run for president.\n\n“If I’d been born in America, I would’ve run,” the native Austrian says in the magazine’s cover story this week. “Because now? This was a very good time to get in the race.”\n\nSchwarzenegger, a Republican, has said he won’t be voting for the GOP nominee, Donald Trump — the same man whom Schwarzenegger is replacing as host of NBC’s The Celebrity Apprentice when it returns Jan. 2.\n\nThe former California governor urged his 4 million Twitter followers to follow suit in an Oct. 8 tweet (the day after the Access Hollywood tape featuring Trump and Billy Bush engaged in a lewd conversation about women was leaked): “For the first time since I became a citizen in 1983, I will not vote for the Republican candidate for president. As proud as I am to label myself a Republican, there is one label that I hold above all else: American. So I want to take a moment today to remind my fellow Republicans that it is not only acceptable to choose your country over your party — it is your duty.”\n\nStill, Schwarzenegger comes with his own baggage. He was accused of sexual assault by multiple women shortly before the gubernatorial election in 2003. And his personal behavior came under scrutiny again six months after he left office in 2011, when it was revealed he secretly fathered a child with his housekeeper while married to NBC’s Maria Shriver.\n\nSchwarzenegger — who was dubbed the “2016 Brand Genius” in the Adweek cover story — backed Ohio Gov. John Kasich during the primaries."
