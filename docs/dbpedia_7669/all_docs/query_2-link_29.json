        "text": "Hi, Ron ... The suggestion that Arnold run for Governor of California has been around for the last four or five years. It was assumed that if he did run for governor of California, it would be in 2006. Schwarzenegger, 55, has made no secret of his interest in running if a more qualified candidate didn't present himself as a viable candidate for the office. With democratic governor, Gray Davis, facing a recall, Arnold may have the opportunity to run before the projected 2006 date. Arnold will be on the cover of the new Esquire Magazine which hits the newsstands on June 13th, and he is quoted as saying, \"Yes, I would love to be governor of California. ... If the state needs me, and if there's no one I think is better, then I will run.\" Arnold hasn't held office, but is no stranger to politics. His wife, Maria Shriver, is the daughter of Sargent Shriver and Eunice Kennedy. Arnold, a Republican, was appointed by Bush Senior as chairman of the president's council on physical fitness and sports, and is well liked by the present Bush administration. In an interview in this week's TV Guide, Arnold admitted he is thinking of running but would wait until after the release of Terminator 3 and after talking with his family about running for office. As for skeletons in the closet: to date nothing major has come to the fore what would preclude his running for the office. Some online links on Google News with links to the story can be found here: Canadian TV (from Associated Press) - http://www.ctv.ca/servlet/ArticleNews/story/CTVNews/1054839283912_26/?hub=Entertainment San Francisco Chronicle - http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/news/archive/2003/06/05/state1305EDT0070.DTL Search Techniques - Google News - Arnold Schwarzenneger - Arnold Schwarzenneger + politics To paraphrase, politics make strange bedfellows. Regards, Serenata\n\nSchwarzenegger did use steroids as a professional bodybuilder in the `70s, although of course he is against drugs now. Political opponents could get a big laugh out of Schwarzenegger's discussion of orgasm frequency in \"Pumping Iron,\" the 1977 bodybuilding documentary that featured Schwarzenegger. Schwarzenegger's father was a Nazi and arguably a war criminal. Schwarzenegger also invited ex-Nazi Kurt Waldheim to his wedding, according to The Jerusalem Post. However, Schwarzenegger is no anti-Semite -- he has visited Israel, played in a klezmer band, even learned some Hebrew. The only federal candidate to which Schwarzenegger has contributed money is brother-in-law Mark Shriver, who lost a congressional primary last year. Schwarzenegger was a major financial and vocal supporter of Prop 49, the successful (and very un-Republican) initiative to require the state to set aside money for after-school programs."
