I now understand why my past attempts to learn other languages (Spanish, German, Latin) have left me with little more than a smattering of near-random vocabulary words, and I’m inspired to try again. Fluent Forever promises a fun, personalized learning regimen that is sure to wire a new tongue into your brain with speed and simplicity. And Wyner’s sharp wit will keep you entertained along the way! I’ve never been so excited to challenge my mind.” —Karen Schrock Simring, contributing editor at Scientific American Mind “Fluent Forever is the book I wish I had had during my numerous failed attempts at learning different languages. It’s a refreshingly fun and engaging guide that shows you how to language hack your brain. Wyner’s done all the hard work so that the reader can actually enjoy the process of becoming fluent in a language quickly!” —Nelson Dellis, 2011 and 2012 USA Memory Champion “Fluent Forever more than meets the daunting challenge of learning a new language by giving the reader a solid game plan based on how people actually learn and memorize information. From the first chapter, I couldn’t wait to get started using Wyner’s techniques and tons of resources. His writing is engaging, smart, and conversational, making learning a real joy. If you’ve ever wanted to become fluent in another language, do yourself a favor and start reading Fluent Forever now.” —Melanie Pinola, contributor writer for Lifehacker.com and author of LinkedIn in 30 Minutes “This is the book I’d use next time I want to learn a new language. It employs an intelligent mix of the latest methods for learning a language on\n\nyour own using the Web, apps, and voice-training tips in an accelerated time frame.” —Kevin Kelly, senior maverick at Wired and author of What Technology Wants “I know what you’re thinking: But learning a new language is soooo hard! The solution? Stop being a whiner and start reading Wyner. This book is a winner! Guaranteed to rewire your brain in as many languages as you’d like.” —Joel Saltzman, author of Shake That Brain!: How to Create Winning Solutions and Have Fun While You’re at It “An excellent book … Wyner writes in an engaging and accessible way, weaving in his personal language journey. His method, proven by his own achievements, is clear: focus on pronunciation, avoid translation, and use spaced repetition extensively. And he offers lots of specific techniques to make sure you’ll never forget what you’ve learned. I’d recommend this book to anyone who is serious—not just aspiring but really serious—about becoming fluent in a foreign language.” —Kevin Chen, cofounder of italki.com “Mash up the DNA of Steve Jobs and Aristotle and add training in engineering and opera, and you get Gabriel Wyner, whose ingeniously elegant system helps us knuckleheads learn not just foreign languages but, well, everything. Autodidacts rejoice!” —Jay Heinrichs, author of Thank You for Arguing and Word Hero “Americans refuse to realize that all languages are foreign—yes, including English. It’s time we learned how to speak like the rest of the world: in more ways than one. This book is a hilarious toolbox that helps you get a head start. Pick a foreign language (yes, including English) and voilà: el futuro es tuyo. High-five to Gabriel Wyner!” —Ilan Stavans, author of Dictionary Days: A Defining Passion\n\nCopyright © 2014 by Gabriel Wyner All rights reserved.

If you talk to him in his language, that goes to his heart. —Nelson Mandela\n\nAmericans who travel abroad for the first time are often shocked to discover that, despite all the progress that has been made in the last 30 years, many foreign people still speak in foreign languages. —Dave Barry\n\nLanguage learning is a sport. I say this as someone who is in no way qualified to speak about sports; I joined the fencing team in high school in order to get out of gym class. Still, stabbing friends with pointy metal objects resembles language learning more than you might think. Your goal in fencing is to stab people automatically. You spend time learning the names of the weapons and the rules of the game, and you drill the proper posture, every parry, riposte, and lunge. Finally, you play the game, hoping to reach that magical moment when you forget about the rules: Your arm moves of its own accord, you deftly parry your friend’s sword, and you stab him squarely in the chest. Point! We want to walk up to someone, open our mouths, forget the rules, and speak automatically. This goal can seem out of reach because languages seem hard, but they’re not. There is no such thing as a “hard” language; any idiot can speak whatever language his parents spoke when he was a child. The real challenge lies in finding a path that conforms to the demands of a busy life. In the midst of my own busy life as an opera singer, I needed to learn\n\nGerman, Italian, French, and Russian. Out of those experiences, I found the underpinnings for this book. My methods are the results of an obsessive need to tinker, research, and tinker again. My language-learning toolbox has, over time, turned into a well-oiled machine that transforms fixed amounts of daily time into noticeable, continuous improvement in my languages and in the languages of every person I’ve taught. In sharing it, I hope to enable you to visit the peculiar world of language learning. In the process, you’ll better understand the inner workings of your mind and the minds of others. You’ll learn to speak a new language, too.\n\nBEGINNINGS So far, my favorite moment of this crazy language-learning adventure took place in a Viennese subway station in 2012. I was returning home from a show when I saw a Russian colleague coming toward me. Our common language had always been German, and so, in that language, we greeted and caught up on the events of the past year. Then I dropped the bomb. “You know, I speak Russian now,” I told her in Russian. The expression on her face was priceless. Her jaw actually dropped, like in the cartoons. She stammered, “What? When? How?” as we launched into a long conversation in Russian about language learning, life, and the intersection between the two. My first attempts to learn languages were significantly less jaw dropping. I went to Hebrew school for seven years. We sang songs, learned the alphabet, lit lots of candles, drank lots of grape juice, and didn’t learn much of anything. Well, except the alphabet; I had that alphabet nailed. In high school, I fell in love with my Russian teacher, Mrs. Nowakowsky. She was smart and pretty, she had a wacky Russian last name, and I did whatever she asked, whenever she asked. Five years later, I had learned a few phrases, memorized a few poems, and learned that alphabet quite well, thank you very much. By the end of it, I got the impression that something was seriously wrong. Why can I only remember alphabets? Why was everything else so hard? Fast-forward to June of 2004, at the start of a German immersion program\n\nfor opera singers in Vermont. At the time, I was an engineer with an oversized singing habit. This habit demanded that I learn basic German, French, and Italian, and I decided that jumping into the pool was the only way I’d ever succeed. Upon my arrival, I was to sign a paper pledging to use German as my only form of communication for seven weeks, under threat of expulsion without refund. At the time, this seemed unwise, as I didn’t speak a word of German. I signed it anyway. Afterward, some advanced students approached me, smiled, and said, “Hallo.” I stared at them blankly for a moment and replied, “Hallo.” We shook hands. Five insane weeks later, I sang my heart out in a German acting class, found a remote location on campus, and stealthily called my girlfriend. “I think I’m going to be an opera singer,” I told her in whispered English. On that day, I decided to become fluent in the languages demanded by my new profession. I went back to Middlebury College in Vermont and took German again. This time, I reached fluency. I moved to Austria for my master’s studies. While living in Europe in 2008, I went to Perugia, Italy, to learn Italian. Two years later, I became a cheater.\n\nCHEATERS OCCASIONALLY PROSPER: THE THREE KEYS TO LANGUAGE LEARNING This book would not exist if I had not cheated on a French test. I’m not proud of it, but there it is. First, some background. The Middlebury Language Schools offer five levels of classes: absolute beginner, “false” beginner (people who have forgotten what they’ve learned), intermediate, advanced, and near fluent. At the time of the test, I was an absolute beginner in French, but I had already learned a Romance language, and I wanted to be with the “false” beginners. So, for my third stint at Middlebury, I cheated on the online placement test, using Google Translate and some grammar websites. Don’t tell Middlebury. A month later, I received my regrettable results. “Welcome and congratulations!” it began. “You have been placed in the intermediate level!” Shit. I had three months to learn a year’s worth of French or look like an idiot at the entrance interview. These interviews are serious business. You sit in a\n\nroom with a real, live French person, you chat for fifteen minutes about life, and you leave with a final class placement. You can’t cheat; you can either speak French or make sad faces and wave your hands around like a second-rate Parisian mime. As I was in the middle of completing master’s degrees in opera and art song, the only free time I had was an hour on the subway every day and all day on Sundays. I frantically turned to the Internet to figure out how to learn a language faster. What I found was surprising: there are a number of incredibly powerful language-learning tools out there, but no single program put all of the new methods together. I encountered three basic keys to language learning: 1. Learn pronunciation first. 2. Don’t translate. 3. Use spaced repetition systems. The first key, learn pronunciation first, came out of my music conservatory training (and is widely used by the military and the missionaries of the Mormon church). Singers learn the pronunciation of languages first because we need to sing in these languages long before we have the time to learn them. In the course of mastering the sounds of a language, our ears become attuned to those sounds, making vocabulary acquisition, listening comprehension, and speaking come much more quickly. While we’re at it, we pick up a snazzy, accurate accent. The second key, don’t translate, was hidden within my experiences at the Middlebury Language Schools in Vermont. Not only can a beginning student skip translating, but it was an essential step in learning how to think in a foreign language. It made language learning possible. This was the fatal flaw in my earlier attempts to learn Hebrew and Russian: I was practicing translation instead of speaking. By throwing away English, I could spend my time building fluency instead of decoding sentences word by word. The third key, use spaced repetition systems (SRSs), came from language blogs and software developers. SRSs are flash cards on steroids. Based upon your input, they create a custom study plan that drives information deep into your long-term memory. They supercharge memorization, and they have yet to reach mainstream use.\n\nA growing number of language learners on the Internet were taking advantage of SRSs, but they were using them to memorize translations. Conversely, no-translation proponents like Middlebury and Berlitz were using comparatively antiquated study methods, failing to take advantage of the new computerized learning tools. Meanwhile, nobody but the classical singers and the Mormons seemed to care much about pronunciation. I decided to use all of these methods at once. I used memorization software on my smartphone to get the French into my head, and I made sure that none of my flash cards had a word of English on them. I began making flash cards for the pronunciation rules, added a bunch of pictures for the nouns and some verbs, learned the verb conjugations, and then built up to simple French definitions of more abstract concepts. By June, in my hour a day on the subway, I had learned three thousand words and grammar concepts. When I arrived at Middlebury, I waited in a room for my entrance interview in French. This interview was meant to ensure that I hadn’t done anything stupid, like cheat on my online placement test. It was the first time I had ever spoken French in my life. The teacher sat down and said, “Bonjour,” and I responded right back with the very first word that came into my brain: “Bonjour.” So far, so good. As our conversation evolved, I was amazed to find that I knew all the words she was saying, and I knew all the words I needed to respond. I could think in French! It was halting, but it was French. I was stunned. Middlebury bumped me into the advanced class. In those seven weeks, I read ten books, wrote seventy pages’ worth of essays, and my vocabulary grew to forty-five hundred words. By the beginning of August, I was fluent in French.\n\nTHE GAME PLAN What is fluency? Each of us will find a different answer to this question. The term is imprecise, and it means a little less every time someone writes another book, article, or spam email with a title like “U Can B FLUENT in 7 DAY5!1!” Still, we maintain an image of fluency in our minds: a summer afternoon in a Parisian café, casually chatting up the waitress without needing to worry about verb conjugations or missing words in our vocabularies. Beyond that café, we must decide individually how far we wish to go.\n\nI would confidently describe myself as fluent in German. I’ve lived in Austria for six years and will happily discuss anything with anyone, but I certainly needed to dance around a few missing words to get out of a €200 fine for my rental car’s broken gas cap. (Apparently, the word for “gas cap” is Tankdeckel, and the words for “I don’t give a damn if I’m the first person to drive this car, the spring holding the gas cap closed was defective” start with “Das ist mir völlig Wurst …” and go on from there.) You’ll have to determine for yourself whether your image of fluency includes political discussions with friends, attending poetry readings, working as a secret agent, or lecturing on quantum physics at the Sorbonne. We struggle to reach any degree of fluency because there is so much to remember. The rulebook of the language game is too long. We go to classes that discuss the rulebook, we run drills about one rule or another, but we never get to play the game. On the off chance that we ever reach the end of a rulebook, we’ve forgotten most of the beginning already. Moreover, we’ve ignored the other book (the vocabulary book), full of thousands upon thousands of words that are just as hard to remember as the rules. Forgetting is our greatest foe, and we need a plan to defeat it. What’s the classic language-learning success story? A guy moves to Spain, falls in love with a Spanish girl, and spends every waking hour practicing the language until he is fluent within the year. This is the immersion experience, and it defeats forgetting with brute force. In large part, our proud, Spanish-speaking hero is successful because he never had any time to forget. Every day, he swims in an ocean of Spanish; how could he forget what he had learned? I learned German in this way, given an opportunity to leave my job, move to Vermont, and cut off all ties to the English-speaking world for two full summers. Immersion is a wonderful experience, but if you have steady work, a dog, a family, or a bank account in need of refilling, you can’t readily drop everything and devote that much of your life to learning a language. We need a more practical way to get the right information into our heads and prevent it from leaking out of our ears. I’m going to show you how to stop forgetting, so you can get to the actual game. And I’m going to show you what to remember, so that once you start playing the game, you’re good at it. Along the way, we’ll rewire your ears to hear new sounds, and rewire your tongue to master a new accent. We’ll investigate the makeup of words, how grammar assembles those words into\n\nthoughts, and how to make those thoughts come out of your mouth without needing to waste time translating. We’ll make the most of your limited time, investigating which words to learn first, how to use mnemonics to memorize abstract concepts faster, and how to improve your reading, writing, listening, and speaking skills as quickly and effectively as possible. I want you to understand how to use the tools I’ve found along the way, but I also want you to understand why they work. Language learning is one of the most intensely personal journeys you can undertake. You are going into your own mind and altering the way you think. If you’re going to spend months or years working at that goal, you’ll need to believe in these methods and make them your own. If you know how to approach the language game, you can beat it. I hope to show you the shortest path to that goal, so that you can forget the rules and start playing already. After I learned German, I thought, “Ach! If I could just go back in time and tell myself a few things, I would have had a much easier time with this language!” I had precisely the same thought after Italian, French, Russian (which I finally learned in 2012), and Hungarian (2013’s project). This book is my time machine. If I squint my eyes just right, then you are monolingual me from nine years ago, and I’m creating a time paradox by helping you avoid all of the pitfalls and potholes that led me to make my time machine in the first place. You know how it is.\n\nHOW LONG DOES FLUENCY TAKE? To estimate the time you’ll need, we’ll need to consider your fluency goals, the language(s) you already know, the language you’re learning, and your daily time constraints. As I said earlier, there is no such thing as a hard language. There are, however, languages that will be harder for you to learn, because they aren’t in the same family as the language(s) you already know. Japanese is difficult for English speakers to learn for the same reason that English is difficult for Japanese speakers; there are precious few words and grammatical concepts that overlap in both languages, not to mention the entirely different alphabets involved. In contrast, an English speaker learning French has much less work to do. English vocabulary is 28 percent French and 28 percent Latin. As soon as\n\nan English speaker learns proper French pronunciation, he already knows thousands of words. The US Foreign Service Institute ranks languages by their approximate difficulty for native English speakers (see Appendix 2). In my experience, their estimates are spot-on. As they predicted, Russian (a level 2 language) took me nearly twice as much time as French (a level 1 language), and I suspect that Japanese (a level 3 language) will take me twice as much time as Russian. I reached a comfortable intermediate “I can think in French and use a monolingual dictionary” level in three months, working for an hour a day (plus weekend binges), and a similar level for Russian in six months at thirty to forty-five minutes a day (plus weekend binges). I then used seven to eight weeks of intensive immersion to bring both of those languages to advanced “comfortable in a cafe, comfortable chatting about whatever, somewhat uncomfortable describing car problems” levels. I’ve seen similar results with my students. Without an immersion program, I suspect advanced French would take five to eight months, working for thirty to forty-five minutes per day on your own. Level 2 languages like Russian and Hebrew should be twice that, and level 3 languages like Chinese, Arabic, Japanese, and Korean should take four times as long as French. These harder languages do take time, but there’s no reason you can’t learn them. You’ve already met the only prerequisite: you’re interested. Think about exercise for a moment. To succeed in an exercise routine, we need to enjoy it or we’ll drop it. Most of us don’t have six-pack abs or fit into a size 2 dress. I’ve certainly tried for the abs (I gave up on the size 2 dress long ago), but I never succeeded, because I rarely enjoy exercise. Those of us who do, succeed. Successful gym rats learn to find the joy (and endorphins) in grueling daily workouts. The rest of us can push ourselves into the gym with willpower, but if we don’t find it enjoyable, we’re unlikely to continue for the six to twenty-four months we need to see results. Fitness plans keep shrinking in time—30-Minute Fitness, the 10-Minute Solution, Ultimate Physical Fitness in 5 Minutes, the 3Minute Workout—in an attempt to make something that’s difficult seem more palatable. But no matter what, we’re still going to be a sweaty, achy mess at the end of it, and getting ourselves fired up to do it every day is hard in the short term and harder in the long term. As long as language learning is hard, we’ll run into the same problems. Who enjoys drilling grammar and memorizing word lists? Even if I promise you\n\nFluency in 30 Seconds a Day, you’re going to have a hard time sticking to it if it’s unpleasant. We’re going to drop the boring stuff and find something more exciting. The tools I’ve assembled here are effective. Much more important, they’re fun to use. We enjoy learning; it’s what addicts us to reading newspapers, books, and magazines and browsing websites like Lifehacker, Facebook, Reddit, and the Huffington Post. Every time we see a new factoid (e.g., “In AD 536, a dust cloud blotted out the sun over Europe and Asia for an entire year, causing famines that wiped out populations from Scandinavia to China. No one knows what caused it”), the pleasure centers of our brains burst into activity, and we click on the next link. In this book, we’re going to addict ourselves to language learning. The discovery process for new words and grammar will be our new Facebook, the assembly process for new flash cards will be a series of quick artsand-crafts projects, and the memorization process will be a fast-paced video game that’s just challenging enough to keep us interested. There’s no coincidence here; we learn better when we’re having fun, and in looking for the fastest ways to learn, I naturally ended up with the most enjoyable methods. My favorite thing about language learning is this: I can basically play video games as much as I like without suffering deep, existential regret afterward (e.g., “I can’t believe I just wasted six hours of my life playing stupid games on Facebook”). I spend thirty to sixty minutes a day playing on my smartphone or watching TV. (The TV series Lost is awesome in Russian.) I get a language out of it, I feel productive, and I have fun. What’s not to like? Let’s learn how to play.\n\nDO THIS NOW: THE PATH FORWARD An organizational note: over the course of this book, I’m going to introduce you to a lot of tools and resources. If you ever forget which one is which, you’ll find them all in the Glossary of Tools and Terms at the end of this book, along with a brief explanation. With that said, let’s get started. I intend to teach you how to learn, rather than what to learn. We can’t discuss every word, grammatical system, and pronunciation system that exists, so you’ll need some additional resources specific to your language of choice.\n\nSpeaking of which, you should probably begin by choosing a language to learn.\n\nChoose Your Language Choose a language based upon employment opportunities, difficulty, availability of resources, or number of speakers, but in the end, choose a language that you like. A reader on my website once asked me whether he should learn Russian or French. His relatives spoke Russian, he loved the culture, but he was worried about the difficulty. French seemed like a safe alternative. Never settle for safe when you can have fun instead. Your language will become a constant companion, living in your head. If you like your language, then you’ll have fun studying it, and when you have fun, you learn faster. You have many resources at your disposal.\n\nLanguage Books Get yourself some books. Someone sat down and spent months (or years, heaven forbid) organizing the information you need, and you can have all of that effort in the palm of your hand for $15–$25. Thank you, Herr Gutenberg. In Appendix 1, I list my favorite picks for the top eleven languages you’re most likely to be studying. If your language isn’t there, go to my website, FluentForever.com. I aim to have book recommendations for as many languages as people want to learn. GET THESE NOW\n\nA good grammar book will walk you through your language’s grammar in a thoughtful, step-by-step manner.1 On the way, it will introduce you to a thousand words or so, give you a bunch of examples and exercises, and provide you with an answer key. You will skip 90 percent of the exercises in the book, but having them around will save you a lot of time once we begin to learn grammar. If the book gives you “Englishy” pronunciation for each word (Bonjour: bawn-JURE, Tschüss: chewss), I give you permission to burn it and find\n\na different one. Walking into a Parisian cafe and saying “bawn-JURE” is a good way to get ignored indefinitely by the waiter. If your new book comes with a CD, then so much the better. There are two pitfalls here to avoid. First, avoid books systematically detailing every single solitary rule and detail and exception, all at once, in an uncontrollable torrent of grammatical despair. I used to love these books—until I tried learning from them. These are technical tomes that lay out the entire grammatical system of a language in giant flowcharts. They’re lovely reference manuals but are very difficult to use in a step-by-step manner. Second, be wary of most classroom books, especially those without an answer key. Books designed for classrooms are often sparse on explanations, because they expect that the teacher will be able to handle any confusion. You’ll often have more luck with a self-study book. A phrase book is a wonderful reference, as it’s difficult to find handy phrases like “Am I under arrest?” and “Where are you taking me?” in a dictionary. Phrase books from the Lonely Planet company are cheap and come with a tiny, extremely practical dictionary in the back. We’ll use this dictionary when we learn our first words, because it’s a lot easier (and faster) to skim through than a real dictionary. We’ll grudgingly allow “bawn-JURE” here but only because there are no phrase books without it. CONSIDER THESE\n\nA frequency dictionary typically contains the most important five thousand words of your target language, arranged in order of frequency. (The number one word in English, the, shows up once every twenty-five words.) These books are amazing, with lovingly picked examples and translations. They’ll save you tons of time and they take so much work to compile that we should be throwing money and flowers at the feet of their authors. There are some online frequency lists, but they’re not as good as the paper versions. Frequency dictionaries don’t exist in every language yet, but if your language has one, you win. Get it. A pronunciation guide will walk you through the entire pronunciation system of your language, with the help of recordings and diagrams of your mouth and tongue. For many languages, you can find guidebooks with CDs devoted entirely to pronunciation. They’re wonderful resources and well worth the purchase. In addition, I’ve made it my personal mission to develop\n\ncomputerized pronunciation trainers in as many languages as I can. These trainers can do a few neat things that textbooks can’t, and we’ll discuss them in depth in Chapter 3. You won’t be able to find a guidebook or trainer in every language, but when they exist, they’re extraordinarily helpful. You also want to find two dictionaries. It is up to you whether you find them online or in print. The first is a traditional bilingual dictionary (e.g., English-French/French-English), with accurate pronunciation listed for every word. Again, if you see “bawn-JURE,” burn it. If you see funny symbols (e.g., [bᴐ̃.ʒuʁ]), keep it. We’ll make friends with the International Phonetic Alphabet in Chapter 3. The second is a monolingual dictionary (e.g., French-French), which has actual definitions (e.g., in French) rather than translations. You’ll never see “bawn-JURE” in one of these, so don’t worry about finding your lighter. You may also want a thematic vocabulary book. These books arrange the words in your language by theme: words about cars, words for food, medical words, and so on. They’re handy for customizing your vocabulary (we’ll talk about them in detail in Chapter 6). FOR THE INTERMEDIATES\n\nIf you’ve already spent some time studying your target language, adjust your shopping list as follows: First, if you already have a grammar book, make sure that you actually like it and that it’s sufficiently challenging. If not, get a new one that fits your level. Second, if you don’t have a phrase book, they’re worth having. Even if you’re already reading books in your target language, you might not know how to ask about business hours or rental car insurance. A phrase book will let you look up sentences for many day-to-day situations that don’t show up in books. Third, you probably don’t have a frequency dictionary yet, and you’ll use it much earlier than a beginner. Go get one. Last, hold off on a pronunciation book or trainer until the end of Chapter 3. You’ll have a better idea then as to whether you’ll need one. THE INTERNET\n\nThe Internet is filling up with free grammar guides, pronunciation guides,\n\nfrequency lists, and dictionaries of all shapes and sizes. The quality varies drastically from site to site and changes daily. You can learn a language for free on the net, but you’ll be able to do it faster if you combine the best Internet resources with well-written books. I list my favorite Internet resources on my website (Fluent-Forever.com/language-resources), and we’ll be discussing the most important websites—Google Images and the new language exchange communities (e.g., Lang-8, italki, Verbling)—throughout this book. TUTORS AND PROGRAMS\n\nIf you need faster results and have some funds to spare, you can speed up your learning with private tutors (who are extremely affordable at italki.com) or intensive programs at home and abroad. The fastest route to fluency is also the least convenient: intensive immersion programs will provide twenty-plus weekly hours of class time, ten to twenty weekly hours of homework, and a strict noEnglish policy. You’ll leave with a comfortable proficiency in your language of choice in exchange for two months of your life and a wad of cash. Some of them have generous financial aid policies if you apply early enough, so they may be within your reach if you lack the funds but have the time. LANGUAGE CLASSES\n\nIn this book, we’re going to discuss the process of learning a language on your own, outside of the classroom. But if you’re already enrolled in a class (or if there are some good affordable classes offered nearby), then be sure to check out Appendix 6: How to Use This Book with Your Classroom Language Course.\n\nThe Path Forward In the coming pages, we will knock down language’s challenges one by one. I’ll introduce you to a memorization system that will allow you to remember thousands of facts effortlessly and permanently. Then we’ll determine which facts to learn. I’ll guide you step-by-step through your language’s sounds, words, and grammar. Every step of the way, we’ll use your memorization system to\n\nlearn more rapidly. Finally, we’ll develop your listening and reading comprehension, as we pave a path toward fluent speech. Along the way, I’ll show you all my favorite toys. I like finding ways to make life more efficient, even when finding a faster way to do something takes more time than simply doing it. Someday the month I spent memorizing a hundred composers’ birth dates and death dates will pay off in time savings, but it hasn’t quite yet.2 When it comes to efficiency in language learning, I got lucky. I needed to learn four languages to fluency for my singing. Beyond these, I want to learn Yiddish, Hebrew, and Hungarian to speak with my relatives, and I’m fascinated by Japanese. With so many languages to learn, I could spend an enormous amount of time looking for efficiency and still justify the time expense. As a result, I have a chest full of neat tools and toys to play with. We’ll begin with my favorite one: the Spaced Repetition System (SRS).\n\n1. They’ll do it, for the most part, in English. Yes, this breaks my no-English rule, but you know what they say about rules and breaking things. 2. But every time I type out a recital program and don’t have to look up a composer’s dates (Johann Strauss Jr., 1825–1899!), I win back a little more time.\n\nCHAPTER 2\n\nUpload: Five Principles to End Forgetting A man’s real possession is his memory. In nothing else is he rich, in nothing else is he poor. —Alexander Smith\n\nA SCENE FROM THE MATRIX, WARNER BROTHERS PICTURES, 1999:\n\nTANK smiles as he sits down in his operator’s chair, flipping through several disks. He picks one, and puts it into his computer. NEO looks at the screen. Neo: Jujitsu? I’m going to learn … jujitsu? Smiling, TANK presses the Load button. NEO’s body jumps against the harness as his eyes clamp shut. The monitors kick wildly as his heart pounds, adrenaline surges, and his brain sizzles. An instant later his eyes snap open. Neo: Holy sh*t! TANK grins. While we can’t yet upload jujitsu directly into our brains, we do have\n\ntechnology that can help us learn faster. This technology derives its power from five principles of memory: • Make memories more memorable. • Maximize laziness. • Don’t review. Recall. • Wait, wait! Don’t tell me! • Rewrite the past. These principles will enable you to remember more in less time. Combined, they form a system that can insert thousands of words and grammar rules so deeply into your mind that you’ll be able to recall them instantly. Most attractively, this system can take what little spare time you have and steadily turn it into a usable foreign language.\n\nPRINCIPLE 1: MAKE MEMORIES MORE MEMORABLE Qualsiasi dato diventa importante se è connesso a un altro. Any fact becomes important when it’s connected to another. —Umberto Eco, Foucault’s Pendulum\n\nTo learn to remember, we must learn about the nature and location of memory. Scientists working in the 1940s and ’50s began their search for memory in the most obvious place: within the cells of our brains—our neurons. They cut out parts of rats’ brains, trying to make them forget a maze, and found that it didn’t matter what part of the brain they chose; the rats never forgot. In 1950, the researchers gave up, concluding that they had most definitely searched everywhere, and that memory must be somewhere else. Researchers eventually turned their search for memories to the wiring between neurons rather than within the cells themselves. Each of the hundred billion neurons in our brains are, on average, connected to seven thousand other neurons, in a dense web of more than 150,000 kilometers of nerve fibers.3 These interconnected webs are intricately involved in our memories, which is\n\nwhy scientists could never find the mazes in their rats. Each rat’s maze was spread throughout its brain. Whenever the scientists cut out a piece, they damaged only a small portion of the involved connections. The more they removed, the longer it took the rats to remember, but they never forgot their mazes completely. The only way to remove the maze entirely was to remove the rat entirely. These patterns of connections form in an elegantly simple, mechanical process: neurons that fire together wire together. Known as Hebb’s Law, this principle helps explain how we remember anything. Take my first memory of cookies. I spent ten minutes waiting in front of the oven, bathed in radiating heat and the scent of butter, flour, and sugar. I waited until they came out of the oven and watched the steam rise up off of them as they cooled. When I could bear no more, my father gave me a glass of milk, I grabbed a cookie, and I learned empathy for my poor blue friend from Sesame Street. My neural network for cookies involves sight, smell, and taste. There are audio components—the sound of the word cookie and the sound of milk pouring into a glass. I remember my dad’s face smiling as he bit into his own delicious cookie. This first cookie experience was a parade of sensations, which wired together into a tight web of neural connections. These connections enable me to return to my past whenever I encounter a new cookie. Faced with a familiar buttery scent, that old web of neurons reactivates; my brain plays back the same sights, sounds, emotions, and tastes, and I relive my childhood experience. Compare this experience to a new one: your currently-forming memory of the word mjöður. There’s not much of a parade here. It’s not obvious how to pronounce it, and in a particularly obnoxious move, I’m not even telling you what it means. As a result, you’re stuck looking at the structure of the word—it has two foreign letters sandwiched between four familiar ones—and not much else. Without Herculean efforts, you will forget mjöður by the end of this chapter, if not sooner.\n\nLevels of Processing: The Great Mnemonic Filter The divide that separates your new mjöður from my cookie is known as levels of processing, and it separates the memorable from the forgettable. My cookie is\n\nmemorable because it contains so many connections. I can access cookie in a thousand different ways. I will remember cookies if I read about them, hear about them, see them, smell them, or taste them. The word is unforgettable. We need to make your mjöður just as unforgettable, and we will do it by adding four types of connections: structure, sound, concept, and personal connection. These are the four levels of processing. They were identified in the 1970s by psychologists who created a curious questionnaire with four types of questions and gave it to college students: • Structure: How many capital letters are in the word BEAR? • Sound: Does APPLE rhyme with Snapple? • Concept: Is TOOL another word for “instrument”? • Personal Connection: Do you like PIZZA? After the questionnaire, they gave the students a surprise memory test, asking which words from the test they still remembered. Their memories were dramatically influenced by the question types: students remembered six PIZZAs for every BEAR. The magic of these questions lies in a peculiar mental trick. To count the capital letters in BEAR, you don’t need to think about brown furry animals, and so you don’t. You’ve activated the shallowest level of processing— structure—and moved on. On the other hand, you activate regions throughout your brain to determine whether you like PIZZA. You automatically utilize structure to figure out what word you’re looking at. At the same time, you’ll tend to hear the word pizza echoing within your skull as you imagine a hot disk of cheesy goodness. Finally, you’ll access memories of pizzas past to determine whether you enjoy pizza or just haven’t met the right one yet. In a fraction of a second, a simple question––Do you like PIZZA?––can simultaneously activate all four levels of processing. These four levels will fire together, wire together, and form a robust memory that is six times easier to remember than that BEAR you’ve already forgotten. The four levels of processing are more than a biological quirk; they act as a filter, protecting us from information overload. We live in a sea of information, surrounded by a dizzying amount of input from TV, the Internet, books, social interactions, and the events of our lives. Your brain uses levels of processing to judge which input is important and which should be thrown out.\n\nYou don’t want to be thinking about the number of letters in the word tiger when one is chasing after you, nor do you want to be assaulted by vivid memories of cows when you buy milk. To keep you sane, your brain consistently works at the shallowest level of processing needed to get the job done. At the grocery store, you are simply looking for the words chocolate milk, or perhaps even Organic Wholesome Happy Cow Chocolate Milk. This is pattern matching, and your brain uses structure to quickly weed through hundreds or thousands of ingredient lists and food labels. Thankfully, you forget nearly every one of these lists and labels by the time you reach your milk. If you didn’t, your encyclopedic knowledge of supermarket brand names would make you a terrible bore at parties. In more stimulating circumstances, such as that tiger in hot pursuit, your brain has a vested interest in memory. In such a case, should you survive, you’ll likely remember not to climb into the tiger enclosure at the zoo. In this way, levels of processing act as our great mental filter, keeping us alive and tolerable at parties. This filter is one of the reasons why foreign words are difficult to remember. Your brain is just doing its job; how should it know that you want to remember mjöður but not disodium phosphate (an emulsifier in your chocolate milk)?\n\nHow to Remember a Foreign Word Forever To create a robust memory for a word like mjöður, you’ll need all four levels of processing. The shallowest level, structure, allows you to recognize patterns of letters and determine whether a word is long, short, and written in English or in Japanese. Your brain is recognizing structure when you unscramble odctor into doctor. This level is essential for reading, but it involves too little of your brain to contribute much to memory. Almost none of the students in the levels of processing study remembered counting the capital letters in BEAR. Words like mjöður are difficult to remember because you can’t get any deeper than structure until you know how to deal with odd letters like ö and ð. Your first task in language learning is to reach the next level: sound. Sound connects structure to your ears and your mouth and allows you to speak. You’ll start by learning the sounds of your language and which letters make those sounds, because if you begin with sound, you’ll have a much easier time\n\nremembering words. Our college students remembered twice as many APPLEs (which do, in fact, rhyme with Snapple) as they did BEARs (which has four capital letters). Sound is the land of rote memorization. We take a name, like Edward, or a pair of words, like cat–gato, and we repeat them, continuously activating the parts of our brain that connect structure to sound. Our mjöður is very roughly pronounced “MEW-ther,” and the more accurately we learn its pronunciation, the better we’ll remember it.4 Eventually, our mjöður will be as memorable as a familiar name like Edward. This is better than structure, but it still isn’t good enough for our needs. After all, many of us don’t remember names very well, because our brains are filtering them out as quickly as they arrive. We need a way to get through this filter, and we’ll find it at the third level of processing: concepts. Our college students remembered twice as many TOOLs (synonym for instruments) as APPLEs (Snapples). Concepts can be broken down into two groups: abstract and concrete. We’ll begin with the abstract. If I tell you that my birthday is in June, you probably won’t immediately see images of birthday cakes and party hats. You don’t need to, and as we’ve discussed, our brains work at the shallowest level required. It’s efficient, and it saves us a lot of work and distraction. Still, the date of my birthday is a meaningful, if abstract, concept. This makes it deeper and more memorable than pure sounds, which is why you’ll have an easier time remembering that my birthday is in June than you’ll have remembering that the Basque word for “birthday” is urtebetetze. Deeper still than abstract concepts are concrete, multisensory concepts. If I tell you that my upcoming birthday party will take place in a paintball arena, after which we’ll eat a cookies-and-cream ice-cream cake and then spend the rest of the evening in a swimming pool, you’ll tend to remember those details much better than you’ll remember the month of the event. We prioritize and store concrete concepts because they engage more of our brains, not because they’re necessarily any more important than other information. In this case, it is less important that you know the details about my birthday than that you know when and where to show up. Given this phenomenon, how do we make a strange, foreign word like mjöður memorable? The word itself is not the problem. We are not bad at remembering words when they are tied to concrete, multisensory experiences. If I tell you that my email password is mjöður, you probably (hopefully?) won’t\n\nremember it, because you’re processing it on a sound and structural level. But if we’re in a bar together, and I hand you a flaming drink with a dead snake in it, and tell you, “This—mjöður! You—drink!” you won’t have any trouble remembering that word. We have no problem naming things; nouns comprise the vast majority of the 450,000 entries in Webster’s Third International Dictionary.5 It’s when those names aren’t tied to concrete concepts that we run into trouble with our memories. Our goal, and one of the core goals of this book, is to make foreign words like mjöður more concrete and meaningful.\n\nBreaking Through the Filter: The Power of Images and Personal Connections Earlier in this chapter, we encountered a translated word pair: cat–gato. As we discussed, standard study practice involves repeating gato and cat until they form a sound connection. This is too shallow to remember easily, but it’s also beside the point; when you read gato, you don’t want to think the word cat; you want to think this:\n\nWe’ll get better results if we skip the English word and use an image instead. We recall images much better than words, because we automatically think conceptually when we see an image. Image-recall studies have repeatedly demonstrated that our visual memory is phenomenal. Memory researchers in the 1960s subjected college students to one of the most terrifyingly-named memory tests ever invented: the Two-Alternative Forced-Choice Test. In it, college students were shown 612 magazine ads (possibly tied to chairs with their eyes held open) and then asked to identify the old pictures when shown a new mixture of images. The students correctly picked the old images 98.5 percent of\n\nthe time. Unsatisfied, the researchers repeated their tests with more images, trying to determine what college students will put up with for low pay and free food. There doesn’t seem to be a limit. Students were willing to sit in dark rooms for five consecutive days, watching ten thousand images in a row. After the study, these students accurately identified 83 percent of the images. Our capacity for visual memory is extraordinary; we only need to learn how to take advantage of it. Since we need to learn words, not pictures, we will use combinations of words and pictures. Such combinations work even better than pictures alone. This effect even applies to totally unrelated images: you will remember an abstract drawing with the sentence “Apples are delicious” better than that drawing alone. Faced with an incomprehensible image and an unrelated word, your brain struggles to find meaning, even if there isn’t any. In the process, it automatically moves the word out of the disodium phosphate trash can and into cookie territory. As a result, you’ll remember.\n\nWe can go one step deeper than pictures by taking advantage of the last level, personal connection. You will remember a concept with a personal connection 50 percent more easily than a concept without one, which is why our college students remembered 50 percent more PIZZAs (Yes, we like them) than TOOLs (Yes, they are synonymous with instruments). This is not to say that concepts alone are ineffective. If you connect gato to a picture of some cute cat, you will have an easy time remembering that word. But if, in addition, you can connect gato with a memory of your own childhood cat, that word will become practically unforgettable. How do we use this in practice? A new foreign word is like a new friend’s name. Our new friend could be a person, a cat, or a drink; the memory burden in each case is the same. Let’s make a new friend’s name memorable using levels of processing.\n\nOur new friend is named Edward. Simply by thinking “Edward,” we have already reached the second level of processing—sound. If we want to go deeper, into concept territory, we would search for a concrete image for the name Edward, such as the movie character Edward Scissorhands. If we spent a moment imagining our new friend with a pair of scissors for hands, we would have an easy time remembering his name later. This strategy is used by competitive memorizers (yes, there are competitive memorizers) to quickly memorize people’s names, and we’ll discuss it in depth in Chapters 4 and 5. But we’re not done yet. We’ll do even better if we can find a personal connection with his name. Perhaps you still remember watching Edward Scissorhands in a theater, perhaps your brother is named Edward, or perhaps you too have hands made of scissors. As you imagine your new friend interacting with Edward-related images and Edward-related personal memories, you are activating broader and broader networks in your brain. The next time you see Edward, this parade of images and memories will come rushing back, and you’ll be hard pressed to forget his name. This gives you valuable social points, which are sometimes redeemable for wine, cheese, and board game nights. This thought process can take creativity, but you can learn to do it quickly and easily. For a concrete word like gato, you can find an appropriate image on Google Images (images.google.com) within seconds. If you simply ask yourself, “When’s the last time I saw a gato?” you will add a personal connection and cement your memory of the word. Easy. For an abstract word like economía (economy), our job is still very simple. When we search Google Images, we’ll find thousands of pictures of money, piggy banks, stock market charts, and politicians. By choosing any of these images, we’ll force ourselves to think concretely and conceptually. As a result, the word will become much easier to remember. If we ask ourselves whether the economía has affected our lives, we’ll get the personal connection we need to remember that word forever. In this book, we’re going to learn vocabulary in two main stages: we’ll build a foundation of easy, concrete words, and then we’ll use that foundation to learn abstract words. Throughout, we’ll use levels of processing to make foreign words memorable. KEY POINTS\n\n• Your brain is a sophisticated filter, which makes irrelevant information forgettable and meaningful information memorable. Foreign words tend to fall into the “forgettable” category, because they sound odd, they don’t seem particularly meaningful, and they don’t have any connection to your own life experiences. • You can get around this filter and make foreign words memorable by doing three things: • Learn the sound system of your language • Bind those sounds to images • Bind those images to your past experiences\n\nPRINCIPLE 2: MAXIMIZE LAZINESS I’ve heard that hard work never killed anyone, but I say why take the chance? —Ronald Reagan\n\nForgetting is a formidable opponent. We owe our present understanding of forgetting to Hermann Ebbinghaus, a German psychologist who spent years of his life memorizing lists of nonsense syllables (Guf Ril Zhik Nish Mip Poff). He recorded the speed of forgetting by comparing the time it took him to learn and then later relearn one of his lists. His “forgetting curve” is a triumph of experimental psychology, tenacity, and masochism:\n\nThe curve reveals how rapidly we forget and what remains once we’ve forgotten. The right side of his curve is encouraging: even years later, Ebbinghaus could expect old random gobbledygook to take him measurably less time to learn than new random gobbledygook. Once he learned something, a trace of it remained within him forever. Unfortunately, the left side is a disaster: our memories rush out of our ears like water through a net. The net stays damp, but if we’re trying to keep something substantial in it—like telephone numbers, the names of people we’ve just met, or new foreign words— we can expect to remember a paltry 30 percent the following day. How can we do better? Our instinct is to work harder; it’s what gets us through school tests and social occasions. When we meet our new friend Edward, we generally remember his name with rote repetition; we repeat his name to ourselves until we remember. If we need to remember—perhaps Edward is our new boss—then we can repeat his name continuously until we’re sick of it. If we do this extra work, we’ll remember his name significantly better … for a few weeks. Extra repetition is known as overlearning, and it doesn’t help long-term memory at all. Can you remember a single fact from the last school test you crammed for? Can you even remember the test itself? If we’re going to invest our time in a language, we want to remember for months, years, or decades. If\n\nwe can’t achieve this goal by working harder, then we’ll do it by working as little as possible.\n\nOne Metronome, Four Years, Six Million Repetitions Hermann Ebbinghaus’s 1885 study has been referred to as “the most brilliant single investigation in the history of experimental psychology.” He sat alone in a room with a ticking metronome, repeating lists of nonsense syllables more than six million times, pushing himself to the point of “exhaustion, headache and other symptoms” in order to measure the speed of memorization and the speed of forgetting. It was the first data-driven study of the human mind, and I suspect it made him a blast at social events.\n\nKEY POINTS • Rote repetition is boring, and it doesn’t work for long-term memorization. • Take the lazy route instead: study a concept until you can repeat it once without looking and then stop. After all, lazy is just another word for “efficient.”\n\nPRINCIPLE 3: DON’T REVIEW. RECALL. In school we learn things then take the test, In everyday life we take the test then we learn things. —Admon Israel\n\nSuppose I made you an offer. I’ll give you $20 for every word you can remember from a list of Spanish words. The test is in a week, and you have two options: (1) you can study the list for ten minutes, or (2) you can study the list for five minutes and then trade it for a blank sheet of paper and a pencil. If you choose the second option, you can write down whatever you still remember,\n\nand then you have to give the sheet back. Here are results from a similarly worded experiment. In it, students either read a text twice or read it once and wrote down what they remembered. They then took a final test five minutes, two days, or one week later. Notice how studying twice (i.e., overlearning) helps for a few minutes and then screws you in the long run. Oddly enough, a blank sheet of paper will help you much more than additional study time. You’ll remember 35 percent more in a week.6\n\nTry this one: after reading through your Spanish word list, you can: A. Get five more minutes with your word list. B. Get a blank sheet of paper and test yourself. C. Get three blank sheets of paper and test yourself three times. Here are your final recall results, one week later:\n\nMadness. How can taking an identical test three times in a row produce such a large effect? Odd as it is, this follows rules of common sense. When you study by reading through a list multiple times, you’re practicing reading, not recall. If you want to get better at recalling something, you should practice recalling it. Our blank sheet of paper, which could be replaced by a stack of flash cards, a multiple choice test, or simply trying to remember to yourself, is precisely the type of practice we need. It improves our ability to recall by tapping into one of the most fascinating facets of our minds—the interplay of memory and emotion. Deep within our brains, a seahorse and a nut are engaged in an intricate chemical dance that allows us to decide what is important and what is forgettable. The seahorse-shaped structure is known as the hippocampus, and it acts as a mental switchboard, connecting distant regions of the brain and creating a map of those connections. You access this map in order to recall any recent memory.7 The connected neurons reactivate, and you relive your past experience. Over the course of months and years, these networked neurons lose their dependency on the hippocampus’s map and take on an independent, Bohemian lifestyle in the outermost layers of the brain.\n\nThe Curious Case of H.M.\n\nThe hippocampus’s role in memory was discovered relatively recently, in one of the most famous case reports in neuropsychology—the case of Henry Molaison. In 1953, Molaison had his hippocampus surgically removed in an attempt to cure his epilepsy. His illness was cured, but the surgery left him with severe amnesia. He retained most of his old memories, but without his hippocampus, he lost his ability to store new ones. Molaison could recall his distant past because the map of those memories had spread throughout his brain. In losing his hippocampus, he lost the ability to make and access new maps and thereby lost his ability to form new memories. His story later became the inspiration for Memento, Christopher Nolan’s film about a man with anterograde amnesia in search of his wife’s killer.\n\nThe hippocampus’s nut-shaped dance partner is the amygdala, and it tells the hippocampus what to keep and what to throw out. It does this by translating our emotions into chemicals, causing our adrenal glands to send out bursts of memory-enhancing hormones according to the situation. If we encounter emotionally arousing input—“Look, a tiger! Ow, my arm!”—then the amygdala will strengthen that memory. If not—“Look, a pencil. I’m hungry”—then it won’t. This leaves us with a healthy fear of tigers and a healthy disregard for pencils as food items. Coupled with the nearby reward centers in the brain, the amygdala provides the mechanism behind our magical blank sheet of paper. Our emotions are reflexive creatures. They respond to our environment whether we want them to or not. While we can try to trick our brains into getting excited over a list of Spanish words, our brains know better. Unless learning that el dentista means “the dentist” in Spanish gives you goose bumps, your amygdala will not give those memories much of a boost. El dentista is just not as important as el tigre. You can try to inject amphetamine directly into your amygdala, which will work, but that may prove to be more trouble than it’s worth. Our blank page, however, changes everything. At the moment where your performance is judged, your brain realizes that it had better get its act in gear. As a result, every memory you recall gets a squirt of memory-boosting chemicals. Those memories are reactivated, your amygdala calls for hormones, your hippocampus maps out the involved networks, and your neurons wire tightly together. Every time you succeed at recalling, the reward centers in your brain release a chemical reward—dopamine—into your hippocampus, further\n\nencouraging long-term memory storage. Your blank sheet of paper has created a drug-fueled memory party in your brain. Your boring word list never stood a chance. KEY POINTS • Acts of recall set off an intricate chemical dance in your brain that boosts memory retention. • To maximize efficiency, spend most of your time recalling rather than reviewing. • You’ll accomplish this goal by creating flash cards that test your ability to recall a given word, pronunciation, or grammatical construction. Coupled with images and personal connections, these cards will form the foundation of a powerful memorization system.\n\nPRINCIPLE 4: WAIT, WAIT! DON’T TELL ME! If it’s hard to remember, it’ll be difficult to forget. —Arnold Schwarzenegger\n\nWe’ve all gone through situations in school and work in which we’re supposed to memorize something, but rarely does someone tell us how to do it. This is not without good reason. There is no such thing as “memorizing.” We can think, we can repeat, we can recall, and we can imagine, but we aren’t built to memorize. Rather, our brains are designed to think and automatically hold on to what’s important. While running away from our friendly neighborhood tiger, we don’t think, “You need to remember this! Tigers are bad! Don’t forget! They’re bad!” We simply run away, and our brain remembers for us. The closest mental action that we have to memorizing is practicing recall (“What was that guy’s name?”). Now we need to investigate precisely what effective recall feels like. Try to recall the foreign words that have shown up so far in this book. You’ll remember some words immediately—perhaps the words from the previous\n\nsection: el tigre, el dentista. If you keep looking, you’ll find a few more in relatively easy reach—perhaps gato is still lurking about. Last, hiding in the murky fog of your brain, a few words may reluctantly emerge.8 If we were to track your ability to remember each of these words, we would see a curious result. By next week, you’re most likely to forget the words you knew best—those words that you remembered immediately. You’re 20 percent more likely to retain the words that took a little more time. But the words that took the most effort to recall—those you had all but forgotten—will etch themselves deeply into your consciousness. You’re 75 percent more likely to remember them in the future, and if they spent a few moments just out of reach at the tip of your tongue, then you’re twice as likely to remember them. What’s going on here? Let’s look at the most extreme example, a word that dances on the tip of your tongue before you finally recall it. A word like this is an incomplete memory. You have access to fragments of the word, but you can’t see the whole picture yet. You can recall that it starts with the letter s, or that it’s something like a poem or a monologue, or that it sounds like solipsist or solitaire, but you need time to reach the word soliloquy. More often than not, in these situations, we recall accurate information. Our word does start with the letter s. Our brains fly into a wild, almost desperate search for the missing piece of our minds, frantically generating S words and throwing them out when they don’t match what we’re looking for. Your amygdala treats these searches as matters of life and death, for surely if you don’t remember the actor who played Matt Damon’s therapist in Good Will Hunting, you will leap out of the nearest window.9 You experience such relief at finally finding your goal that the word becomes nearly impossible to forget. How do we take advantage of this? Do we even want to? Tricking our brains into a permanent, desperate chase after missing words sounds stressful. Doing this a hundred times a day sounds like a recipe for early heart failure. Fortunately, we don’t need to be stressed to remember; we just need to be interested. We will get bored if we spend our days incessantly asking ourselves whether we still remember our friend Edward’s name. It’s too easy, it’s tedious, and it doesn’t work very well. If we wait longer—until we’re just about to forget— then remembering Edward’s name becomes a stimulating challenge. We’re aiming for the point where a dash of difficulty will provide just the right amount of spice and keep the game interesting. If we can find it, we’ll get twice as much benefit for our time, and we’ll have much more fun in the process.\n\nKEY POINTS • Memory tests are most effective when they’re challenging. The closer you get to forgetting a word, the more ingrained it will become when you finally remember it. • If you can consistently test yourself right before you forget, you’ll double the effectiveness of every test.\n\nPRINCIPLE 5: REWRITE THE PAST The difference between false memories and true ones is the same as for jewels: it is always the false ones that look the most real, the most brilliant. —Salvador Dalí\n\nI remember waking up one day with a symphony in my head. I had dreamt that I was sitting at my desk, composing, and I woke up with the results intact. Beaming with pride, I ran to my brother. “Listen to this,” I said, and began humming a few bars. “Isn’t that awesome? I composed it in my sleep!” “No, you didn’t,” my brother replied. “It’s from the Superman movie. We saw it last week.” As we discussed earlier, a memory is just a web of connections: disparate neurons fire together, wire together, and become more likely to fire together in the future. In my dream, I remembered the Superman theme at the same time as I envisioned myself composing. My brain reflexively connected the two into a convincing new memory—a false memory—and I went and embarrassed myself in front of my brother. This happens to all of us, and it’s a result of the way we store memories. In a 2011 memory study, researchers showed two groups of college students a vivid, imagery-laden advertisement for a new, fake brand of popcorn: Orville Redenbacher’s Gourmet Fresh. Afterward, they thanked the first group and sent them home. Then they gave the second group samples of fresh popcorn. One\n\nweek later, they brought both groups back and asked them about their impressions. Here’s where it gets creepy: both groups vividly remembered trying the popcorn, even though one group never had. They all thought it was delicious. When we remember, we don’t just access our memories; we rewrite them. Prompted by the popcorn advertisement, these college students remembered movie nights at home, the smell of corn and butter, the crunch in their mouths, and the salt on their lips. In the midst of reliving these experiences, they saw images of other people enjoying popcorn in bags marked “Orville Redenbacher’s Gourmet Fresh,” and their memories changed. The network of neurons from past movie nights activated at the same time as they saw the brand’s logo. Because neurons that fire together wire together, their brains stored these new connections as if they had always been there. Our “single” memories are amalgamations of every recall experience we’ve ever had. When I remind you of the word gato, you probably recall the little image of a cat from earlier in the chapter. But as that image floats around in your head, you can’t store it just as it was. You are a different person now, with different information in your head and a different section of this book in front of you. Perhaps you’ve changed rooms, or your emotional state, or perhaps you now have a cat in your lap. You have a wholly new set of neurons involved in this gato experience compared with your last one. As a result, your new gato memory will join the new connections from your present to the old reactivated connections from your past. In that single act of recall, your gato network has doubled in size. This rewriting process is the engine behind long-term memorization. Every act of recall imbues old memories with a trace of your present-day self. This trace gives those memories additional connections: new images, emotions, sounds, and word associations that make your old memory easier to recall. Once you’ve rewritten these memories enough times, they become unforgettable.\n\nFeedback to the Rescue Of course, you must remember a memory before you can rewrite it. You will remember “American Express: Don’t leave home without it” to your dying day\n\nbecause American Express has spent millions of dollars making its ads memorable. Every time you see a new American Express ad, the vivid images and sounds are rewritten into your memory of their all-important slogan. You would forget their slogan between each commercial cycle if they eliminated the famous actors and imagery-laden travel scenarios from their ads. If this happened, the crucial rewriting process would never occur. “Don’t leave home without it” would become just another forgotten advertisement, rather than one of the most successful ad campaigns in history. In practicing recall, we are striving to continuously rewrite our memories. We create a memory for gato, and we build upon that memory with every recall until it is as unforgettable as an ad slogan. But what happens when we can’t remember? Surely we won’t be able to remember everything we learn, particularly if we’re trying to wait as long as possible between practice sessions. The day may come when we try to remember gato and draw a blank instead. We’ve forgotten the word, and in this scenario, it will stay forgotten. Like Ebbinghaus’s gobbledygook, we’ll be able to learn it faster in the future, but we won’t get any benefit from our practice. We need a way to restore our forgotten memories, and we’ll find it in immediate feedback. Feedback is a simple concept with dramatic results. If we encounter our gato flash card and get stumped, then we can simply look at the back side of the card and see a picture of a cat. We have just given ourselves immediate feedback, and as a result, one of two things happens. If our memory of gato has vanished, then we start over. We form a new, “original” experience at the moment we got stumped and looked at the answer. This is not as good as remembering our actual original experience, but it’s still very effective. Our brains are primed and ready to create a new memory. As we search our memories for gato-related images and associations, we build a wide network of neural connections. We may remember that gato is a type of animal but can’t remember which one. If we encounter an image of a cat while these connections are still active, our completed network will burst into activity, the reward centers of our brains will activate, and we’ll have a new, deep, and memorable experience to build upon. Alternatively, we may still have access to our original memory of gato. This memory will burst into life—“Oh, yeah!”—at the moment we see that picture of a cat. In this scenario, we’ll relive our memory, our new experience will join it, and the memory will be rewritten with new connections. Thanks to a simple act\n\nof immediate feedback, we’ve regained our rewrite. Feedback allows us to resuscitate forgotten memories and get the most out of our practice sessions. KEY POINTS • Every time you successfully recall a memory, you revisit and rewrite earlier experiences, adding bits and pieces of your present self to your past memories. • You’ll make the best use of your time when practicing recall if your earlier experiences are as memorable as possible. You can accomplish this by connecting sounds, images, and personal connections to every word you learn. • When you do forget, use immediate feedback to bring back your forgotten memories.\n\nTIMING IS EVERYTHING: THE END OF FORGETTING μέτρα φυλσσεσθαι καιρòς δ’ ∊̓ττὶ ττα̴σιν α̋ριστσς Observe due measure, for right timing is in all things the most important factor. —Hesiod\n\nHow do we combine the five principles? We want our original memories to be as deep and multisensory as possible (1: Make memories more memorable). We want to study as little as possible (2: Maximize laziness), and practice recall as much as possible (3: Don’t review. Recall). We want our recall practice to be challenging but not too hard (4: Wait, wait! Don’t tell me!). Last, when we practice, we want to nearly forget those original experiences but not forget them completely. When we do forget, we want immediate feedback to put us back on track (5: Rewrite the past). If we could predict exactly how long we could remember each thing we learn, we would be able to work miracles with our minds. We would have an alarm that went off right before we forgot where we left our car keys, and life would be a wonderful paradise free of forgetting. Unfortunately, our memories are too messy. They make unpredictable connections to everything we experience or\n\nimagine. They lose pieces of our past and gain pieces of our present. Any mention of a car, a lock, or even a word that rhymes with key can enhance or suppress our key-related memories. I can’t count the number of times that I’ve memorized some word, only to have some new, similar-sounding word come along and screw everything up months later. We can’t accurately predict when we will forget a single memory. However, we can make predictions about a group of memories. Take a gaggle of college students and teach them obscure trivia, like “Who invented snow golf?” Then let them practice recall once, and test them six months later.10 Depending upon the timing of that single practice session, you’ll see quite different results:\n\nFor students trying to remember something for six months, the immediate practice session (which produced a 27 percent final score) is not bad at all. But as the delay increases to twenty-eight days, the students’ scores double. This pattern appears in numerous studies, although the ideal delay changes depending upon the final test date. There is a complex balance between the advantages of nearly forgetting and the disadvantages of actually forgetting, and it breaks our forgetting curve in half:11\n\nThat single practice session has made the difference between forgetting nearly everything and remembering quite a bit. Here’s the final leap: if immediate recall practice is good, and delayed practice is better, and if one session is good and many sessions are better, what happens if you delay your recall practice many times?\n\nWe’ve found the end of forgetting. You learn a word today and then shelve it for a while. When it comes back, you’ll try to recall it, and then shelve it again, on and on until you couldn’t possibly forget. While you’re waiting for your old words to return, you can learn new words and send them off into the future, where you’ll meet them again and work them into your long-term memory. At least until you can upload jujitsu directly into your brain, this is the most efficient way to memorize large amounts of information permanently.\n\nIn Search of the Perfect Interval You want to remember as much as possible now, later, and much later. To choose how often to practice, you have to balance efficiency and comfort. In general, you’re not studying for a single test with a specific date, so you can’t pick an optimal interval and run with it. For the extreme long term, you’ll get the best efficiency if you wait years between practice sessions, but that won’t help you in the short term at all. Moreover, your practice sessions would be extremely frustrating. After such a long delay, you’d have forgotten almost everything. On the other hand, if you practiced all the time, you’d be able to\n\nremember almost everything, but your old words would come back so often that they would bury you in hours of daily work. The thread between these two goals—remembering now and remembering later—starts small and grows rapidly. You’ll begin with short intervals (two to four days) between practice sessions. Every time you successfully remember, you’ll increase the interval (e.g., nine days, three weeks, two months, six months, etc.), quickly reaching intervals of years. This keeps your sessions challenging enough to continuously drive facts into your long-term memory. If you forget a word, you’ll start again with short intervals and work your way back to long ones until that word sticks, too. This pattern keeps you working on your weakest memories while maintaining and deepening your strongest memories. Because well-remembered words eventually disappear into the far off future, regular practice creates an equilibrium between old and new. You’ll spend a fixed amount of time every day learning new words, remembering the words from last week, and occasionally meeting old friends from months or years back. By doing this, you’ll spend most of your time successfully recalling words you’ve almost forgotten and building foundations for new words at a rapid, steady clip. Playing with timing in this way is known as spaced repetition, and it’s extraordinarily efficient. In a four-month period, practicing for 30 minutes a day, you can expect to learn and retain 3600 flash cards with 90 to 95 percent accuracy. These flash cards can teach you an alphabet, vocabulary, grammar, and even pronunciation. And they can do it without becoming tedious, because they’re always challenging enough to remain interesting and fun. Spaced repetition is a godsend to memory intensive tasks like language learning. It’s a pity that it wasn’t a subject back in school, when I had a lot more to remember. At its most basic level, a Spaced Repetition System (SRS) is a to-do list that changes according to your performance. If you can remember that pollo means “chicken” after a two-month delay, then your SRS will automatically wait four to six months before putting pollo back on your to-do list. If you’re having trouble remembering that ropa means “clothing” for more than two weeks, your SRS will put ropa on your list more frequently until it sticks for good. What does this look like in practice? SRSs come in two main flavors: on paper or on computer. The computerized versions will perform all scheduling on their own. Every time you access your computerized SRS, it will automatically teach you twenty to thirty new cards and quiz you on the\n\nhundred or so cards you’re about to forget. Your job is to tell your SRS whether or not you remember a particular card, and your SRS’s job is to build a daily, customized to-do list based upon your input. This list is designed to help you memorize as efficiently as possible, so that you can spend your time learning instead of micromanaging. A paper SRS accomplishes the same feat using a flash card file box, a carefully designed schedule, and a few simple instructions. It’s basically a simple board game. The game contains seven levels, which correspond to seven labeled sections in your file box (i.e., level 1, level 2, etc.). Every card starts on level 1, and advances to the next level whenever you remember it. If you forget, the card falls all the way back to level 1. Whenever a card gets past level 7, it has won its place in your long-term memory. Every time you play with your paper SRS, you’ll consult your schedule and review the levels of the day (e.g., December 9: Review levels 4, 2, and 1). This is your daily to-do list, and it adapts to your performance because of the way your cards gain and lose levels. By following the rules of the game (see Appendix 3), you create a primitive, paper computer program. This program is just as effective and fun as a computerized SRS and is satisfying in an “I did this by myself” sort of way. At the end of this chapter, we’ll compare paper and computerized SRSs in depth, so you don’t have to make up your mind just yet.\n\nDIY Deck Building This is not Rosetta Stone. You can’t just download a deck of flash cards for your SRS and magically learn a language. Why not? Flash cards are fantastic at reminding you about your original experiences, but they’re not particularly good at creating memories in the first place. If you read someone else’s gato flash card, you probably won’t spontaneously think of your childhood cat or of the numerous Shrek: Puss in Boots (Gato con Botas) images that show up on a Google Images search for the word. There’s no movie, no sound, and no story. Under these circumstances, you’ll be hard-pressed to form a deep, multisensory memory while you’re busily studying on the way to work. This isn’t the SRS’s fault; it’s in the nature of the language game.\n\nThe Power of the Creative Process Have you ever studied for a test by writing out a summary of your notes? It worked fairly well, didn’t it? When you create something, it becomes a part of you. If, instead, you simply copied someone else’s notes, you wouldn’t benefit nearly as much. When you try to memorize someone else’s work, you are fighting an uphill battle with your brain’s filters. Even though gato = [picture of a cat] is much easier to remember than gato–cat, it still isn’t stimulating enough to store permanently, because someone else chose it, not you. In contrast, when gato is a cat that you chose, then that choice allows you to sidestep your mental filters. As a result, you’ll have a much easier time remembering.\n\nOne of the reasons why language programs and classes fail is that no one can give you a language; you have to take it for yourself. You are rewiring your own brain. To succeed, you need to actively participate. Each word in your language needs to become your word, each grammar rule your grammar rule. Programs like Rosetta Stone can provide decent original experiences for words like ball and elephant, but eventually, you need to deal with words like economic situation. Abstract words like these require complex, personal connections if you’re ever going to use them comfortably while speaking. You have to make those connections for yourself, because no one else can tell you how the current situación económica has affected you. You also need to retain the connections you’ve made, even when you’re busy learning new words. This is a lot to do at once, so you might as well use the best tools for the job. Until someone puts a USB port into the back of our skulls, our most effective weapon against forgetting is spaced repetition. And since we need deep, memorable experiences to get the most out of spaced repetition, we might as well get them in the process of making our flash cards. The card construction process is one of the most fun and satisfying ways to learn a language. Content in the knowledge that every detail will become a permanent memory, you become the architect of your own mind. What breed of dog will you think about when you wish to remember the word dog? Which examples will you choose to form your verb conjugations? What vocabulary is most useful for your own life?\n\nMaking these decisions forms an exciting part of the learning process and, ultimately, takes very little time. After getting used to your SRS, you can add new cards in a matter of seconds. For most nouns, you can simply type the word once, search for a picture on Google Images, and copy (or draw) it onto your card. This can take less than fifteen seconds. Imagery for more complicated ideas will, of course, take more time to identify—a process that itself gives you the connections you need to make a word your own. I sincerely wish I could sell my personal flash card decks. If their usefulness were transferable, I’d make a lot of money and help a lot of people. Instead, I give them away for free on my website with the disclaimer that no one has successfully used them to learn a language. Of the few thousand people who have downloaded them, no one has tried to refute that claim, so I feel confident stating here that my personal decks are useless to anyone but myself. Use them at your own peril.\n\nFrustration and the Fate of Your Smartphone For a moment, let’s consider what happens when someone (not you, of course) tries to use one of my decks. At some point, he’ll run into my card for dog and see a golden retriever puppy. Now, I have had the fleeting, fifteen-second experience of searching for this image on the Internet, seeing many different dogs of many different ages and breeds, and choosing this golden retriever. In those few seconds of searching, I learned what this word means and chose a pleasant reminder for this learning experience. However, anyone else will have to answer a number of questions and have nothing to base their answers upon. Does this word refer to the breed of dog? Its age? Its color? In using a nonpersonalized deck, this instant of confusion will be recorded along with the memory, and the meaning of the word will be uncertain. On its own, uncertainty is not a terrible thing; a great deal of uncertainty is often involved in learning a language in a foreign country. The problem with uncertainty in your flash cards is that it makes your daily reviews more difficult, which translates to added time and added forgetting (which also adds time). The original experience that you’ll remember with every review will become “WHAT does this MEAN? I don’t have TIME for this $#*@!” which can quickly become frustrating.\n\nThis last point is the deadly one. As soon as your daily reviews become frustrating, it gets harder and harder to sit down and do them. You may be able to force yourself to stick with it for a few weeks, but you need longer than that to see major results. This becomes a vicious cycle, because frustration impedes your ability to remember, which puts the frustrating cards in front of you more often, which eventually causes you to throw your smartphone out of the nearest window. All of this is unnecessary. The learning process for a new word takes very little time, and it’s time well spent. If you take just a moment to figure out how to remind yourself of the meaning of a word, you can retain that word forever. This point was nicely summed up by Damien Elmes, the creator of my favorite SRS program, Anki: “Creating your own deck is the most effective way to learn a complex subject. Subjects like languages and the sciences can’t be understood simply by memorizing facts—they require explanation and context to learn effectively. Furthermore, inputting the information yourself forces you to decide what the key points are and leads to a better understanding.” I’d add that the card creation process is a lot of fun, too. You get to spend time by yourself and for yourself, learning, discovering, and creating. Once you’ve done this, your daily reviews become enjoyable, because most of your time is spent saying to yourself, “Holy sh*t! I can’t believe I still remember that! I am a rock star!” It’s a daily self-esteem booster that happens to teach you a language at the same time, and it’s an easy habit to form and maintain. We like habits; they make the difference between comfortably chatting with the Parisian waitress and awkwardly asking for the English menu. KEY POINTS • Spaced repetition systems (SRSs) are flash cards on steroids. They supercharge memorization by automatically monitoring your progress and using that information to design a daily, customized to-do list of new words to learn and old words to review.\n\nDO THIS NOW: LEARN TO USE A SPACED REPETITION SYSTEM\n\n(SRS) We have found a way to defeat forgetting. Now we must decide what to remember. In the next four chapters, I’ll show you precisely what to learn and how to learn it. We’ll begin with the sounds and alphabet of your language. This will give you the structure you need to remember new words easily. To accomplish this, I’ll show you old and new tools that can quickly rewire your ears, and we’ll use spaced repetition to rapidly memorize example words for every important letter combination (e.g., gn as in gnocchi). In short order, you will master the sounds of your language. Armed with your language’s sounds, you can begin to tackle words. I will show you a list of the 625 most frequent concrete nouns, verbs, and adjectives. These words are easy to visualize, which makes them easy to remember. We will insert them into your SRS with a combination of pictures, personal connections, and sounds. In turn, your SRS will quickly insert those words into your long-term memory. In the process, you’ll construct a foundation upon which you can build the rest of your grammar and vocabulary. Finally, I will show you how to use Google Images to find illustrated stories for every word and grammatical concept in your language. You’ll use these stories to make effective, memorable flash cards for your SRS. Before long, your grammar will become a reflex, and you won’t need to worry about it. Every new word will reinforce that grammatical reflex, and every new piece of grammar will reinforce your words. Your language will build itself to fluency, and you’ll come along for the ride. Before we begin, you have a choice to make. There are two main types of SRSs: paper-based and computer-based. Choose your SRS and learn to use it. Then look at your daily schedule and determine how much time you have available. We’ll use that information to create a language-learning habit.\n\nChoose Your Spaced Repetition System The most popular SRSs are computer-based, and my absolute favorite is Anki. First released in 2008, Anki is free, easy to use, and runs on every operating\n\nsystem and smartphone.12 It syncs between devices (so you can study at home on your computer and then continue on your smartphone on the train to work), and it can handle images and sound files. You tell it how many new flash cards you want to learn every day, and it handles the rest. In roughly thirty minutes per day, you can learn thirty new cards and maintain all of your old cards. Scale up or down as needed to fit your schedule and tolerance for LCD screens. If you prefer working with your hands, you can create an SRS with physical flash cards. Named after an Austrian science journalist writing in the 1970s, the Leitner box is just a particularly clever way to use a flash card file box, some dividers, and a calendar. In the original version, your box is divided into four sections. You review section 1 every day, section 2 every two days, section 3 every three days, and so on. When you successfully remember a card—gato = [cute picture of a cat]—it moves into the next section. If you forget, it moves back into section 1. This acts like a gauntlet for words; any flash cards that can get all the way to the last section have won their way into your long-term memory. The original system uses shorter intervals than we need (one/two/three/four days as opposed to weeks/months), but we can fix that by adding a few more dividers and changing the schedule around. You’ll find detailed instructions and an appropriate schedule for a Leitner box in Appendix 3, along with download links for Anki. Not sure whether or not to use a Leitner box? When you use physical flash cards, you benefit from an involved, hands-on arts and crafts experience with each of your cards. This is a wonderful learning experience that will make your cards much easier to remember, and you lose this experience when you move to a computer. Still, computerized SRSs have a number of advantages over physical flash cards, so don’t make your decision just yet. First things first. You can’t make paper flash cards talk. You’ll be learning pronunciation before you learn vocabulary, and it’s much easier to learn pronunciation when your flash cards can talk to you. If you use physical flash cards, you’ll need to set aside time to listen to recordings of your words, and you’ll need to become very comfortable with a phonetic alphabet (a fәnεtık ælfәbεt). This won’t take you a long time, but it is work, and now you can’t say I didn’t warn you ahead of time. Second, it is extraordinarily easy to get pictures from Google Images into\n\ncomputerized flash cards, and pictures are the most effective way to remember large amounts of information. Even if you use physical flash cards, and even if you’re a terrible artist, you should be drawing pictures for every word you encounter. Your visual memory is too helpful to ignore, and as long as you can tell your cat stick figure from your dog stick figure, you’ll still reap the benefits. Third, the process of finding images for computerized flash cards is one of the most powerful learning experiences you could ever hope for. Again, your brain sucks in images like a sponge. Just a few seconds browsing through twenty dog images will create a powerful, lasting memory. Even if you’re using physical flash cards, don’t pass up the opportunity to learn your words through Google Images. We’ll cover this process in depth in Chapter 4. Last, you’ll be making two cards for many words: a comprehension card (bear = ?), and a production card (big, furry animal, likes to eat honey = ?). Making duplicate cards on a computer is easy; doing it by hand can get tedious. If it’s too tedious, skip the production cards. You may get enough of a memory bump from the arts and craftiness of physical flash cards to spare yourself the need for them, and if you’re having trouble keeping a word in memory, then you can always make the production card later. Go to Appendix 3 and pick your poison. If you choose to use a Leitner box, then you have some supplies to pick up and a calendar to fill in. If you go for Anki, then download it, install it, and follow the video tutorials until you understand how to use it.\n\nTime Commitments and Your Language Habit Take a moment to plan out your budding language habit. You will have two customizable time commitments: creating your flash cards and reviewing those flash cards. Your flash card reviews should be regular; ideally, you’re looking for a slot in your schedule that you can maintain on a daily basis. If you can connect your review time to another regularly recurring event in your life (e.g., breakfast or your daily commute), you’ll have an easier time establishing a new language habit. While daily reviews are best, any regular routine will naturally adapt to your schedule. If you skip weekends, for example, you’ll have more reviews on Mondays. But since you’re only learning for five days a week, you’ll have fewer\n\nreviews than someone practicing daily, so it will stay manageable. Start with a small number of new cards (fifteen to thirty) per day; you can always decide later if you want to go crazy with your flash cards. As mentioned earlier, you can learn thirty new cards per day and maintain your old cards in exchange for thirty minutes a day. If you go overboard with learning new cards, they will come back later, whether you have time for them or not. In the middle of my Russian adventures, I spent a summer learning sixty new cards per day (it took me around an hour a day). After the summer, when I had significantly less time, those cards showed up for months in my daily reviews. I eventually got through them, but if I had begun learning Russian in that way, I may have run away screaming. Learn new cards at a rate that you know you can maintain. Do note that we’re talking about learning thirty new cards per day, rather than thirty new words. Over the next few chapters, I’m going to show you how to break sounds, words, and grammar into their smallest, easiest-to-remember bits. You’ll memorize each bit individually. As a result, some words may involve a small handful of cards. This may sound like more work (“I have to memorize four flash cards for a single Chinese character?”), but as you’ll see, it’s going to make your life much easier. SRSs give you the ability to retain everything you throw into them. As long as you can review a little bit each day, there’s no end to what you can jam into your head, and as long as your cards are simple and easy to remember, you’ll be able to learn them quickly and easily. There’s one more time commitment—card creation—and it can be much more sporadic than card reviews. I tend to go on card creation binges once a month, sitting for absurd numbers of hours in front of my computer and making hundreds upon hundreds of cards in a weekend. I get obsessive when I’m having fun. You may prefer a more moderate approach. You’ll find that it’s a nice way to spend a long Sunday afternoon, and if your schedule demands something more regular, then twenty minutes every day should do the trick.\n\nA Tip for Missed Days When dealing with a bloated review pile, continue learning two to three new words per day. It will spice things up a bit without adding much to your time commitment.\n\nIf you miss a day (and you will occasionally), then it’s not the end of the world. The only difficulty is that your reviews will pile up whether you want them to or not. Remember, your SRS is just a fancy to-do list. If your SRS believes that you’re about to forget the word pollo, then that flash card will land in your to-do list even while you’re vacationing in Hawaii. Once you get back from your vacation, you may have a long list waiting for you. At that point, you should complete those reviews first. They’ll give you the best payback for your time, and they’ll get you back on track with your language habit. Cut back on learning new cards, and spend a few days working at you"
