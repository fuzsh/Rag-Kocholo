        "text": "The following information passed a request for deletion.\n\nThis discussion is no longer live and is left here as an archive. Please do not modify this conversation, but feel free to discuss its conclusions.\n\nA specific person, no citations, no secondary meaning. —Michael Z. 2009-09-21 05:31 z\n\nAs far as I can see proper nouns are always WT:RFV issues as they need attributive use. I think this one might pass, but then again it might not. Mglovesfun (talk)\n\nCited in attributive use, IMO. Ergo, would meet CFI. DCDuring TALK\n\n[From duplicate section created 21:48, 2 October 2009 (UTC)]\n\nEncyclopedic, unfit for a dictionary. Korodzik\n\nAlready RfDed above #Arnold Schwarzenegger. Cited in attributive use IMO. DCDuring TALK\n\nCited, so kept. Anyone disagree? Mglovesfun (talk)\n\nThis entry has survived Wiktionary's verification process.\n\nPlease do not re-nominate for verification without comprehensive reasons for doing so.\n\nI don't think most of the quotations that are currently listed really confirm the use and sense of this term. All except the third are compounds, and they could just as easily be references to the person Arnold Schwarzenegger and not the noun. I don't think can really count for this term; they really count towards \"Arnold Schwarzenegger voice\" and so on. Only the third quotation unambiguously refers to this term as an independent noun. Can we find more citations that clearly show this to be a noun in its own right, and not just part of a compound that could refer to the person? —CodeCat\n\nAttributive use of a noun is use of a noun, at least in English. DCDuring TALK\n\nI disagree, but even so, there's still my other point. None of those \"attributive uses\" as you call them clearly reflect the sense in the entry, and could easily (even more likely IMO) refer directly to the person instead. —CodeCat\n\nSee Talk:Arnold Schwarzenegger. TeleComNasSprVen (talk)\n\nIMO, \"an Arnold Schwarzenegger physique\" is a reference to the specific person, and \"an Arnold Schwarzenegger voice\" is likewise a reference to Ahhnuld's specific Austrian German accent, so neither of those citations supports a common noun meaning \"a[ny] muscleman\". OTOH, I think that \"what an Arnold Schwarzenegger does\" and \"with an Arnold Schwarzenegger chest\" support the noun POS. - -sche (discuss)\n\nI don't see an objective basis for the distinction. If you are reducing yourself to a datapoint based on linguistic 'feel', then there is no disputing the fact that you feel that way. DCDuring TALK\n\nWell then how else is RFV supposed to work? Aren't we supposed to determine whether words mean what we say they mean? —CodeCat\n\nTwo more cites added. — Ungoliant (falai)\n\nPassed. — Ungoliant (falai)"
