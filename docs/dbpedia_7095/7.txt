Nice vessel, had a pleasure to go onboard and see even the bridge - an oldfashioned bridge unlike on present vessels. The dining rooms were located on lower promenade deck with windows to deck, that's not a very usual location for dining rooms on larger ocean vessels. Just what has become of Sitmar? Are they someway associated with one of the present cruise lines with head office in Monaco?
