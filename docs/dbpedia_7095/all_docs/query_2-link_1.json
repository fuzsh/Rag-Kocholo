        "text": "From June through September Alaska's Inside Passage turns into a nautical highway. Cruise ships ply its waters night and day, shuttling passengers from one point of interest to another.\n\nThe voyage is a scenic one. Tree-covered islands and mountains shrouded in mist float past your stateroom window. You may catch sight of an Alaskan brown bear ambling along shore or humpback whales romping in the water. The panorama is always spectacular.The Inside Passage is a popular cruise destination for many reasons. The scenery is one. The variety of shore excursions is another. They range from scenic flights over Misty Fjords National Monument near Ketchikan to river running near Juneau. My favorite was a flight over Taku Glacier and a feast of fresh salmon broiled to juicy perfection at a wilderness lodge. A bus trip from Skagway over White Pass into the Yukon Territory came a close second.\n\nCruises of the Inside Passage vary in length. My 14-day cruise on Sitmar's FairSky (Sitmar has since merged with Princess) began and ended in San Francisco. Most cruises set sail from Seattle or Vancouver.\n\nPorts of call vary, too, although Victoria, Vancouver, Ketchikan, Juneau, Skagway, Glacier Bay and Sitka are usually among them.\n\nPrices also vary, not only from one cruise line to another, but from discounts to full fare on the same ship. Discounts are available to passengers who book early, book at the last minute or buy their cruise through a travel agency that offers volume discounts.\n\nSome cruise lines offer tours via train, bus and plane to landlocked sections of Alaska. A 14-night Princess cruise from Vancouver to College Fjord, for example, includes taking the train from Anchorage through Denali National Park to Fairbanks; driving by bus to Prudhoe Bay; and flying back to Seattle via Anchorage. The undiscounted price begins at $2,549 per person.\n\nFor more information on Inside Passage cruises, talk to your travel agent.\n\nPORTS OF CALL\n\nVictoria is British Columbia's capital city. Located on the southern tip of Vancouver Island, its elegant gardens and charming architecture lend to the city's festive atmosphere. The influence of Mother England is still apparent. Two-decker tour buses ply its streets and baskets laden with flowers adorn every lamppost. A portrait of the queen hangs in the Parliament Building and tea is served every afternoon in the lobby of the Empress Hotel.\n\nThe provincial museum is certainly worth a visit. So is the Parliament Building. Above all, don't miss Butchart Gardens. They are an oasis of color in the rolling hills of suburbia north of the city. The rose garden alone could occupy hours. Don't miss the begonia bowery.\n\nVictoria is British Columbia's political capital. Vancouver is its center of finance. Products of western Canada inevitably pass through Vancouver's busy harbor. High-rises cast shadows over such ethnic neighborhoods as Chinatown. For a breath of fresh air, take a bike ride through Stanley Park, or better yet, walk. The park is large enough that once you get into it, you feel like you're miles from the city.\n\n---\n\nKetchikan, in my mind at least, is the most scenic town on the Inside Passage. Rows of houses, painted every pastel on the palette, are set against a mountain background. A lonely white steeple stands starkly above the town's skyline and peaks are playing peekaboo through the early morning mist.\n\nKetchikan is a center for Tlingit and Haida Indian cultures. Thirty totem poles rescued from abandoned villages are on display at Totem Heritage Center. Saxman Totem Park has what is billed as the largest totem collection in the world.\n\nScenic flights to Misty Fjords National Monument are well worth the money. Keep in mind that afternoon flights are less likely than morning departures to be cancelled because of fog. Creek Street, where houses are built precariously on piles over a stream, is located near the waterfront.\n\n---\n\nJuneau is Alaska's modest capital. The city clings to the hillside of Gastineau Channel. Residents wake up to a panorama of magnificent mountains and breathe air scented with pine. Landmarks include St. Nicholas Russian Orthodox Church, Mendenhall Glacier and the State Capitol.\n\nGold played a major role in the city's development. If you walk a mile or two into the mountains, away from the hustle and bustle of downtown Juneau, you come across the mill of the Alaska-Juneau Mine. You'll find other mining remnants as you scavange around the mountainside.\n\nThe Juneau-Douglas City Museum specializes in the city's mining history. The Alaska State Museum documents the history, culture and arts of Alaska's capital city.\n\nWhether the capital should be moved to a more convenient location has been the subject of debate for years. You can get to Juneau one of two ways: by air or by sea. A proposal to move the capital to a site near Anchorage was defeated. The debate will likely continue.\n\n---\n\nSkagway is one of few places along the Inside Passage that's connected to the vast interior by road. The highway, paved a few years ago, climbs over White Pass to the Yukon Territory, leading eventually to Whitehorse.\n\nAmong the few pockets of civilization is Carcross, a skeleton of a town on the shore of Lake Bennett. The lake is a jewel of blue shimmering against a clear mountain sky.\n\nSkagway's history is indelibly linked to the Klondike gold rush of 1896-'97. Thousands of gold-seekers used Skagway as a starting point for their trip to Dawson. The journey to White Pass was cumbersome. They spent the winter camped near Bennett and Lindeman lakes and in the spring floated 500 miles downstream in homemade boats to Dawson.\n\nKlondike Gold Rush National Historic Park encompasses buildings in Skagway that date back to the gold rush. A short walking tour takes you to almost every point of interest.\n\nBus excursions to Carcross are available or you can take the narrow gauge train to White Pass and back. The railroad is an engineering marvel considering it was built by hand at the turn-of-the-century.\n\n---\n\nGlacier Bay National Park is a highlight of any Inside Passage cruise. Your ship pulls alongside a 100-hundred foot glacier wall, waiting for slabs of ice to peel off and crash into the water. One cruise ship at a time is allowed to enter the bay. Park rangers come on board and explain the ecology over the loudspeaker.\n\nYou'll be awed by the scenery and overwhelmed by the expanse of the glaciers. Glacier Bay alone is worth the trip.\n\n---\n\nFor 126 years, the Russians explored and ruled what is now Alaska. Sitka was the capital of the Russian territory until 1867, when the city was transferred to the U.S. St. Michael's Cathedral, built in 1844 and rebuilt after a fire in 1966, is one of the remnants of Russian influence. The Alaska Museum houses a fabulous collection of artifacts from early explorers and Natives.\n\n*****\n\n(ADDITIONAL STORY)\n\nTravel by train through the wilderness\n\nhe train from Anchorage to Fairbanks via Denali National Park is perhaps the best-known of the three routes operated by the state-owned Alaska Railroad system. The train runs daily from May 19-Sept. 20. One-way fare for the 11 1/2-hour trip, which also stops at Wasilla, Talkeetna and Nenana, is $98. Many tourists disembark at Denali National Park where they stay overnight and take a wildlife tour. They return to Anchorage the following day. Round-trip fare from Anchorage to the park is $136. Reservations are recommended. Off-season the train runs only on weekends.\n\nThe four-hour train ride from Anchorage to the port town of Seward winds through high mountain scenery. It is considered the most scenic train ride in the state. Operates daily from May 26-Sept. 9. Round-trip fare is $60.\n\nThe fare for the 30-minute ride from the town of Whittier on Prince William Sound to Portage is $7.50. Double that for a round-trip ticket. The trip is a popular day-excursion with cruise ship passengers docked at Whittier.\n\nFor information call 1-800-544-0552 or write Alaska Railroad Corp., Passenger Services, P.O. Box 107500, Anchorage, Ala. 99510-7500. Twenty-five percent discount on tickets over $50 during shoulder seasons: May 19-June 10; Aug. 28-Sept. 20.\n\nThe White Pass & Yukon Route railroad takes you from Skagway to the top of White Pass to Fraser. Motorcoaches transport you from Fraser to Whitehorse. Scenery here is magnificent and the narrow gauge railroad dates back to the turn-of-the-century. Call 1-800-343-7373 or write to White Pass & Yukon Route, P.O. Box 435, Skagway, Alaska, 99840.

Ferries in the southeastern system stop at Ketchikan, Wrangell, Petersburg, Sitka, Juneau and Haines. The trip begins at Bellingham, Wash., or Prince Rupert, B.C., and ends at Skagway.\n\nPrices from Bellingham to Skagway are as follows: two-bed cabin with window - $204; four-bed cabin with window - $279; one-way fare per person - $218; vehicle - $522 to $620 depending on its length.\n\nThe trip from Bellingham to Skagway takes 3 1/2 days. The trip from Prince Rupert to Skagway takes 36 hours, excluding Sitka, and 48 hours including Sitka.\n\nWhittier, Valdez, Cordova, Tustemena, Seward and Kodiak Island are among the places served by the southwestern system.\n\nFor a cabin reservation, send in a written request a year ahead of time. Include your name, address, telephone number, number in party (include children's ages) and preferred travel dates. Include alternate dates and cabin or stateroom requirements. Full fare must be paid at least 45 days before your date of sailing.\n\nPhone reservations are taken beginning Jan. 2. Cabins are usually sold out by the end of the first week.\n\nBut you don't have to sleep in a cabin. Passengers can sleep on deck chairs in heated, covered solariums. There are public showers and restrooms. Each ferry has a cafeteria. The ferry Columbia has a restaurant.\n\nSenior citizens can travel free from October through May, standby status. Vehicles, cabins, food and beverages are charged at normal rates.\n\nFor information write the Alaska Marine Highway, Pouch R, Juneau, Ala. 99811, call 1-800-642-0066, or contact your travel agent.\n\nTravel agents can make reservations for ferries and most hotel and sightseeing excursions."
