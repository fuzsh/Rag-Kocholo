        "text": "The Cruise & Maritime Voyages fleet auction is over, with five ships heading to new owners or to scrap, and the values have finally been revealed as buyers were able to get cruise ships for pennies on the dollar during the sealed bidding process.\n\nThe Results:\n\nVasco Da Gama\n\nBuilt: 1992\n\nTonnage: 55,451\n\nCapacity: 1,258 Guests\n\nBuyer: Mystic Invest\n\nSales Price: $10,187,000\n\nHistory: Originally operated by Holland America, the ship was built in 1992. The original S-Class ship, it sailed as the Statendam until 2015, when Carnival Corp. transferred it to P&O Australia where it sailed as the Pacific Eden, along with its sister ship, the Pacific Aria, the former Ryndam.

A year later, the vessel was sold to Soviet owners, becoming the FedorDostoyevskiy. After years sailing chartered to European tour operators, the vessel got its original name back and in 1996 was acquired by TransOcean Tours. In 2013, it was chartered to CMV for a new operation in Australia. The British cruise line later acquired TransOcean Tours to focus on the German market.\n\nMagellan Built: 1985\n\nTonnage: 46,052\n\nCapacity: 1,452 Guests\n\nBuyer: Seajets\n\nSales Price: $3,431,000\n\nHistory: In service since 1985, the Magellan was built for Carnival Cruise Line as the Holiday.
