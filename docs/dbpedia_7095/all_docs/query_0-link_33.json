        "text": "Click the logo above to reach the Cruise-Australia FrontPage for News Updates & “Ship of the Month”\n\nWith Reuben Goossens\n\nMaritime Historian, Cruise‘n’Ship Reviewer, Author & Lecturer\n\nPlease Note: All ssmaritime and my other related ssmaritime sites are 100% non-commercial and privately owned sites. Be assured that I am NOT associated with any cruise or shipping companies or travel/cruise agencies or any other organisations! The author has been in the passenger shipping industry since May 1960 and is now semi-retired, but continues to write article on classic liners and cruise ships in order to better inform cruise and ship enthusiasts for their pleasure!\n\nPage Three - B\n\nIntroduction to the 1989 Brochure:\n\nFor me this special Sitmar Cruises brochure is a very sad one for it never came to fruition, as it was released in March 1988 for cruises in 1989. However, on July 14, 1988 that all of Sitmar Cruises was obtained by P&O and therefore all ships, including the Australian TSS Fairstar, TSS Fairsea, TSS Sitmar Fairwind, TSS Fairsky and ship already launched and in fit-out stage, the MV Sitmar FairMajesty was taken over by P&O and all, except the Fairstar were transferred to their sister company Princess Cruises and renamed. The Fairstar was transferred to P&O in Australia and she continued under her original name cruising from Sydney. The Fairsea was renamed the Fair Princess and the Sitmar Fairwind the Dawn Princess, Fairsky became the Sky Princess, whist the Sitmar Fair Majesty was completed in 1989 as the Star Princess and she was officially named by Audrey Hepburn.\n\nTo date I have only scanned the front and back covers, and the pages covering the page revealing the new Sitmar FairMajesty, which was due to be completed in 1989, and some of the photographs from this edition. However, I am delighted to say that I did do a scan of the only published Deck Plan of the Sitmar FairMajesty that was ever released and it is below the images. The two plans of the ship are quite large; however, if you wish to see even larger versions, just click on the plans and a much larger one will open up in a new window. When it opens, it may well reduce in size, but just click on the new image and it will expand to it full size!\n\nIn due course, should time permit I hope to add some further images from this 101 page brochure, but due to age and health problems, this was all I able to manage at this time. I am sure that for all those genuine ship lovers and those who recall those wondrous days of Sitmar Line and the quality of Sitmar Cruises, you will enjoy viewing this. Enjoy!\n\nReuben Goossens.\n\nHere we see the front (left) and back page (right) of the final brochure ever released by Sitmar Cruises in Monaco\n\nHe we see pages 6 and 7 named “The Ships” but of course it highlights the new Sitmar FairMajesty\n\nTSS Fairsky is the newest ship in the Sitmar fleet and was built in 1984 she is seen at anchor in Charlotte Amalie, in St-Thomas\n\nA wonderful view of the TSS Fairsea during one of her many 14 or 16 day Panama Canal cruises\n\nHowever, on the West Coast, Mexico cruises were extremely popular and here again we see a romantic view of the\n\nFairsea at sunset offshore at Puerto Vallarta’s Lady of Guadalupe Cathedral revealing the quiet dignity of Spanish architecture\n\nAlthough this photo is not in the brochure, I added to be able to add the Sitmar Fairwind to this page\n\nShe is seen here berthed at Port Everglades ready for another Caribbean cruise\n\nMV Sitmar FairMajesty Official Deck Plan:\n\nIf you wish to view a larger plan, just click on the Plan below!\n\nIf you wish to view a larger plan, just click on the Plan below!\n\nGo to Page Four Sitmar Memorabilia and Menus\n\n****************************************\n\nSitmar Cruises INDEX:\n\nPage One … The Ships History - From Liners to Cruise Ships!\n\nPage Two … Deck Plans - 1972, 1973/74, 1985 & 2000.\n\nPage Three … Brochures, Photographs & Other Items.\n\nPage Three B … Sitmar Cruises Final Brochure for 1989, but these cruises never eventuated.\n\nPage Four … Sitmar Memorabilia and Menus.\n\nPage Five … Other Sitmar Cruises Ships to 1988.\n\nPage Six … MV Arcadia, launched as Sitmar FairMajesty\n\n.with a 1998 Author’s Photo Album!\n\n****************************************\n\nReturn to the ssMaritime Main INDEX\n\nssMaritime.com & ssMaritime.net\n\nWhere up to 700 liners of the past make history & the 1914 built MV Doulos Story\n\nPhotographs on ssmaritime and associate pages are by the author or from the author’s private collection.
