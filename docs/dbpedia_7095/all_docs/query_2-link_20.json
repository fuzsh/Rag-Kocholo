Addressing the savvy traveller’s desire for some place new from Accra to Zanzibar was another priority.\n\nThis successful formula had Silversea Cruises expand and they now operate thirteen ships. Silversea Cruise’s motto “Every Wish Granted” is certainly applied. Their high crew to passenger ratio is 1:1 which delivers the most attentive service a passenger could ever experience.\n\nSilversea offer authentic luxury.
