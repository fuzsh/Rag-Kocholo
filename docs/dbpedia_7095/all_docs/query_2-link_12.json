        "text": "Before selecting a cruise, it may be prudent to find out the type of shipboard entertainment it will provide. On most liners, each evening and many an afternoon will doubtless offer a choice of attractions. Their nature, quality and variety can vary substantially from cruise to cruise, however, and what some passengers may find thoroughly enjoyable, others may not like at all.\n\nMinimally, a cruise liner will probably carry a couple of singers, a comedian, a novelty act and a quartet of dancers. Sometimes tonight's singer is one of tomorrow night's dancers, and last night's tenor is tonight's comedian. The entertainers are professional; they are booked through theatrical agencies. But many have seen better times or are resigned to the fact that stardom at sea is the most to which they can aspire.\n\nOn the Costa liners, such as the Carla C and Flavia, entertainers often double as members of the hospitality staff, according to Libby Cannold, a company spokesman. They may assist the cruise director, she said, by working as hostesses at the information desk, assisting in embarkation and landing procedures or helping to ready passengers for excursions ashore.\n\nSome liners present virtual Broadway extravaganzas - well known and lavishly produced musical comedies starring performers who may not be prominent but at least have appeared in road companies of the same shows. A few ships present big names, some of them to amuse but others to stimulate the intellect.\n\nThe more time a ship spends in ports, the less it is likely to expend on entertainment, because the accent will be on excursions ashore. Such is certainly true of the three- and four-day cruises out of Miami to the Bahamas, on which professional entertainment is sometimes interspersed with embarrassingly amateurish performances by passengers themselves.\n\nThe variety of entertainment, if not also the quality, is likely to increase in proportion to the size of the ship. There will be more passengers to please and more public lounges in which to please them. Acts are likely to rotate from room to room, but the aim is to keep the ship hopping.\n\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.
