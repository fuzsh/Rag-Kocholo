        "text": "From Russian Revolution To Shipping Revolution\n\nVessel management is a major part of the commercial shipping, and warrants an article in its own right. However, as a practical case study in how a single company mastered this kind of activity, a worthy example is that of Vlasov ships, otherwise known as V.Ships, based in the Mediterranean Principality of Monaco since 1984, and today run by its president, Roberto Giorgi. However, although v. Ships as a management agency was formed in 1984 following the split from its parent company Vlasov, it owes its existence to the creation of the Vlasov group many years previously by the company’s founder, Alexandre Vlasov, a Russian émigré.\n\nAlexandre Vlasov (born 1880 in Novocherkassk, died 1961), and his son Boris Vlasov (born 13th March 1913 in Odessa, died 2nd November 1987 in Monaco) were the leading members of a Russian-originating family, and first moved to Italy before settling in Monaco, the family were ship owners, and controlled several shipping companies from 1925, as well as influencing the international maritime sector in general. Many ships have sailed with the group over the years, from 150-ton trawlers to the giant supertankers, and all the group’s ships have been identified by yellow funnels with a large letter “v” superimposed on the yellow background. Perhaps the most famous company within the Vlasov group has been the SITMar (Societá Italiana Trasporti Marittimi) Line, which was one of the pioneers of the modern- day cruise sector."
