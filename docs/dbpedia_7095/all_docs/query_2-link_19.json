        "text": "We were scheduled to tender in Dubrovnik in the Gruz town, as the old town anchorage was occupied by two cruise ships and the dock by the Carnival Freedom. As the tender ride would be a long one, I arrived a little early to give as much time as possible for the guests to enjoy the port. I was not a happy person when I came around the corner and found that my assigned anchorage was occupied by one of the ships assigned to downtown. It turned out that there was some swell there and this particular ship could not keep a lee for its boats so it shifted. As a result I had to anchor further out and that increased the tender distance even more.\n\nHowever nothing could be done about it, so I was glad that I decided to arrival ahead of schedule. The other ship left at 1600 hrs. and then I raised the anchor and moved in closer, reducing the tender distance by 5 minutes. The weather was off and on rain and sunshine. The rain came with wind gusts and that meant that I had to keep the engines going to help to control the ships swing as there was not much room to move about. Local television found the arrival of a 1000 ladies of sufficient interest to dispatch a camera team to film the tender dock. My 2nd officer who was supervising the shore side tender procedures was totally startled when he suddenly became the focus of the tv team as being the most senior officer present. Consequently he had to endure an interview in Croatian English. As a result he was world famous in Croatia for 5 minutes on the six oâ€™clock news.\n\nDuring the day the weather started to improve steadily and that means that by tomorrow we will have our normal sunny weather back again. As the weather here can change very very quickly I try to listen as much as possible to weather forecasts given on the VHF radio apart from checking the internet websites every morning and evening. A very good station is Bari radio here in the Adriatic. (Bari is a town on the East coast of Italy, about halfway down) It was funny to hear, at 08.30 the announcement started with a “Gale warning, rain and wind” and 10 minutes later the new weather forecast only mentioned sunny periods and light winds. Things had apparently improved rapidly in the South Adriatic in a very short period of time. All the better for us.\n\nAfter a night with rainy weather we arrived at 05.30 at the Venice pilot station where the weather improved rapidly. By the time we docked the rain clouds had receded to the horizon and the sun started to come out. Getting into the berth was a tight operation as we had on one side the Carnival Freedom and on the other side the Sky Wonder. The rest of the day turned out very to be nice, so good that the sail away party in the afternoon could be held on the outside deck.\n\nThe Sky Wonder is a most peculiar ship as it is a steam ship. The last cruise ship that was built with steam propulsion. The ship was constructed as the Fairsky for Sitmar cruises in the 1983. The owner of Sitmar at that time, Boris Vlasov, was a strong believer in steam even when all the other ships were motorized to reduce fuel consumption. His calculation was based on the idea that a steam plant requires less maintenance and will thus offset, in the long run, the cost of the extra fuel needed to attain the same speed. When the ship entered service the cruise industry kept a close eye on the performance of the Fairsky, often comparing the ship with the Nieuw Amsterdam and Noordam of Holland America Line. The N-ships had very slow running motor engines which were very fuel efficient. When the oil prices started to rise in the late 80â€™s the concept of the Fairsky did not work anymore and thus she was the last cruise ship built with a steam plant. The ship remained highly successful and after Sitmar was taken over by Princess, she became the Sky Princess. Since about a year she is owned by the Spanish operator Pullmantur.\n\nWe have one more cruise to go and then the ship will leave for Baltic, by means of a 14 day European Capitals cruise. From a point of logistics it is not so easy to provision a ship that is on the move and therefore we prefer to do this in the home port or turn around port. For the Mediterranean this is Venice and for the Baltic it will be Copenhagen. Stocking up for a regular cruise and for the coming 14 days after that takes a bit of doing and today was a very busy day for the provisions master as truck after truck arrived. Every item had to be checked off and frozen and chilled supplies to be directly packed away into the cold rooms. However all was loaded on time and the process will be repeated again 10 days from now.\n\nWe are now starting a charter cruise. Oliviaâ€™s Mediterranean Culinary Adventure cruise. Oliviaâ€™s is an organization for and by women. Ladies who prefer their own company to those of others. Thus we have a 1000 of them on board and great fun it is. Oliviaâ€™ charters each year 3 to 5 cruises with a Holland America and they love the company. My crew likes these cruises too. The atmosphere on board is really upbeat and a great time is had by all. This cruise they have brought on board a number of celebrity chefs who will do special cooking demonstrations during the cruise, hence the name Culinary Adventure cruise. It is a regular East Mediterranean cruise with a little twist as we will swap the port of Katakolon with the port of Mykonos.\n\nWe had indeed local weather on arrival. Light rain and a bit of sunshine on the dock, heavy rain 3 miles to the North and a sea swell running towards the shore from the wind of yesterday. The Veendam docked in Dubrovnik but the Grand Princess had been scheduled for tendering into the old town. However on arrival they found that the swell was running straight into the old town harbor so the ship moved to the anchorage near our dock with the intention to take our place as soon as we sailed.\n\nSuch a late minute change of location causes a bit commotion on the shore side. All the tour buses have to be re-located and shuttle buses have to be arranged at short notice as the dock is located in Gruz harbor and it is a ten minute bus ride to the old town. In two days time we will have to tender as well, as there will be 5 ships in Gruz Harbour (Luka Gruz in the Croatian language) but the pilot promised good weather, so hopefully we will have more luck than the Grand Princess.\n\nAnother ship in port that morning was the Spirit of Adventure. This ship belongs to an English company called Saga Cruises and they cater exclusively to a market for the 55 and older. No children on board and the average age is in the mid to late 60â€˜s. The company has three ships, the Saga Rose, Saga Ruby and this one. Marketing is only done in Great Britain. The Spirit of Adventure does not have a Saga name as the company wants to make very clear that the ship is different from the regular product. It offers more adventure style cruises and has a very extensive lecture program on board. The ship was built in 1979 as the Berlin for the German operator Peter Deilmann. It measures just under 10000 tons and with a draft of less then 15 feet it can go too many places where a regular size cruise ship can not go. Thus with the shallow draft they docked all the way into Gruz harbor in the corner that is normally used for ships tenders.\n\nWe departed exactly on time and then spent the afternoon sailing between the Croatian islands. As it was still very windy outside there were only a few sailing boats out in the open. If you know how to sail properly a strong breeze really makes it fun to do some ocean sailing but it seemed that most sailers preferred to stay in port that day. We heard several conversations on the VHF with people talking about making restaurant reservations and meeting for cocktails. Just fine for us, the less sailboats out in the open sea, the less issues we have to deal with.\n\nBy late evening we were back in the middle of the Northern Adriatic sea and exposed to a whole series of thunderstorms. These storms tend to be very concentrated and as we sail through them we have a downpour for about 15 minutes and the wind can whipped up to 50 or 60 knots. The lightning can be quite spectacular with intense light flashes against a pitch black sky. The rain made at least one man very happy, my chief officer. He had been suffering from complaints from our guests about dirty windows and sand on the deck and nothing he could do about it. In ports he was severely hampered in cleaning due to local regulations and at sea you can not clean windows outside the ships hull. So now with one big downpour all his troubles were taken care of. At least for the next two days, when we come to the Greek islands again.\n\nThis was the first day with inclement weather since a long time, due to a depression building over the centre mediterannean. Luckily the winds did not affect us that much and it was only noticeable to the guests when we changed course coming out of the Strait of Messina. The wind was coming from the East South East and the mountain ridges of Calabria acted as a funnel. That gives the peculiar phenomena that the wind kept a direction just of the port bow, while we made a 100 degree course change. While we changed course, the wind changed direction as well, guided by the general lay of the mountain range. In the Strait of Messina, it blew from the south as the mountain range is North South, and when we came around the South point to the East, the wind followed the mountain ranges again. East -West.\n\nCruise ships catch a lot of wind and we ballast the ship to keep it from listing. However the pumps can not always keep up with the changing wind or the pace of the course change and then the ship will lean until we are on the next course. The pumps can compensate again. We have two internal tanks with a big pump in between that we use to transfer water from one side to the other. If that is not enough, we can use the regular ballast tanks. We can also transfer fuel from one side of the ship to the other (but that is a very slow process) or we can switch the drinking water consumption from portside tanks to starboard tanks and vice versa. We use close to 500 tons of drinking water each day, so by just switching can make a considerable difference to the listing of the ship.\n\nBy the time we had turned the corner and were heading into the Adriatic Sea, the wind started to increase but still from the South East and we were going north. That meant a following wind, so the relative wind on the deck was the true wind minus the ships speed and as are result it was still comfortable for the guests. Another thing with the Med. is that there is no ocean swell. All the waves are wind driven. It takes quite awhile before the wind has given the waves sufficient momentum that it becomes noticeable for a ship the size of the Veendam.\n\nThere can be very bad with autumn and winter storms in the area, especially if the winds blow for a number of days from the same direction but in the summer the gales are of short duration and the seas return to a smooth state very quickly. The one nice thing for us was that during the sailing through the Strait of Messina there were no fishing boats around. The SE wind, blowing against the current causes a lot of turbulence in the water and to be in there with a small boat gives the feeling as if you are navigating through a washing machine on full spin cycle. The big ships are not affected as the current eddies are too small but for a fishing boat it can be dangerous and so the fishermen were all at home waiting for the wind to die down.\n\nThe wind started to die down during the course of the evening and the weather forecast predicted the chance of a local thunderstorm for Dubrovnik. The word “local” is the unpredictable part of the forecast in Dubrovnik, as the weather can differ greatly within the range of a few miles, depending if there are mountains in between or not.\n\nI think that I have mentioned this before but the port of Naples is a form of controlled mayhem. Ferries going in and out, ships at anchor, ships drifting near the breakwater, and little fishing boats all over the place. That makes for a very interesting arrival. On our final approach we were sandwiched between two ferries, whose only intent seemed to be to get into port as quickly as possible, regardless of the rest of the world. Blocking our course was a drifting container ship, obviously waiting for a berth but its position was right in the middle of the normal approach and exit route of the port. It was a very nice and wind still morning, while we swerved around him, but the weather was extremely hazy. We never saw Mount Vesuvius and ships around us loomed in the haze as grey lumbering mastodons.\n\nWe docked again at the regular passenger pier, only this time on the West side as the East side was taken up by the Carnival Freedom. They had arrived just ahead of us and by the time the Veendam was docked they were discharging their thousands of guests via two gangways. One gangway on the pier area for the tours and gangway on the Upper level which has the normal terminal access. For the guests I had hoped, that it being a Saturday, the traffic in Naples would be a little bit less hectic than normal but unfortenately regular pandemonium prevailed outside the terminal entrance. Naples is a town steeped in history and a great place to visit, and so is the surrounding country side, but the traffic is a challenge. Most of our guests were wise and had either chosen a ship organized tour or used a taxi to get to where they wanted to go.\n\nI remember an incident from a few years ago, when I was with the old Noordam in Naples. I had gone for a walk around the Castle that dominates the port and was just on my way back. On the other side of the street was a lady walking whose body weight was, letâ€™s say, considerable. She had her hand bag, a big one, slung over her right shoulder with the straps across her breast so that the bag itself hung on her left hip. Out of nowhere came a scooter with two guys on it. They zipped by very close. Then the one on the backseat grabbed the handbag with the intention that the strap would break and he would be able to steal the bag while the speed of the scooter ensured a quick escape.\n\nHowever this strap was of some strong elastic material and did not break, it just stretched. The lady noticing what was happening froze on the spot. But because of her weight, she did not move an inch while the scooter tried to sped off but could not as the strap did not break and the thief did not let go. The rest of the scene was something out of a movie. The scooter came to a sudden halt, the driver lost control and both scooter and men crashed into the wall in front of the lady. The handbag remained in one piece. The lady quickly recovered from the shock and started bashing the two men with the same handbag while they were lying dazed on the ground. A few seconds later a policeman came around the corner, and the two thieves made a hurried exit, while still receiving the occasional hit from the hand bag. The policeman walked to the lady, obviously asked if she was ok, congratulated her with her actions, started the scooter and drove off in the traffic.\n\nI then found out that the lady was one of the Noordam guests, so I sent her a bottle of wine for dinner that evening, to congratulate her with her heroic actions. I still wonder what that police officer did with the scooterâ€¦â€¦â€¦â€¦â€¦â€¦, I guess the two drivers never claimed it back. Naples, controlled mayhemâ€¦â€¦â€¦â€¦.\n\nDocking today was a bit of a challenge as the harbor master had assigned us to a dock that was too short for the length of the Veendam. To disembark the guests we had to use another exit from the ship and that meant docking with the nose out. However as the dock was only 90 meters long (while the Veendam is 220 meters) there was no place to put our bow lines ashore. Thus we had to use our anchors to keep the bow in position. Although not a complicated maneuver it was an elaborate one which required extra officers to handle the anchors, one for each anchor, and when going astern to the dock the officer aft had to keep me carefully advised of the decreasing distances, so I could stop the ship in time. The trick was to get the stern as far in as possible so that as much as possible of the ships side rested against the pier.\n\nIn the end we had the stern about 15 feet away from the end of the dock. We could not go any further as there was an electricity box on the dock side that would have blocked our exit door for the gangway. This sounds a bit strange but we come across these sorts of things all the time. A port will build a beautiful dock and then starts to decrease it usefulness by cluttering it up with all sorts of structures. Items that should have been recessed in the pier surface, or at least, moved away from the edge of the dock where the ships gangway will be positioned. Through the years I have had problems with bringing the ship into a perfect position because of lantern posts, fire hydrants, Telephone boxes, plant displays, bunker stations, gates and fences. It is getting better lately as port authorities discuss new projects more often with the cruise lines. Also in instances where the company builds their own docks (such as Carnival did in Grand Turk Island) the result is much better.\n\nIt is always interesting to find out what the sea bottom is made up of. When the anchor is raised again, the part of the chain closest to the anchor and the anchor itself is often covered in mud or sand. It depends on the composition of the soil if it is easy to clean the anchor or not. A lot of people think that it is the anchor that holds the ship in position but that is for larger ships this is not really the case. The anchor is the “hook in” point for the chain. When the anchor is dropped, we go astern with the ship until the flukes of the anchor dig themselves into the seas bottom. Then we continue to pay out a certain amount of chain. Most of this chain rests on the sea bottom and the weight and friction of that resting chain keeps the ship from floating away. We have formulae and rules of thumb that we apply to decide how much anchor chain we will pay out to keep the ship safely “at anchor”.\n\nThe nautical chart tells us what the seabottom is supposed to be made up of. So you see letters such as G. Bk.Sh etc. in the chart. This translates into Gravel and Broken Shells. If you then pick up the anchor, it should come up clean as gravel and broken shells normally do not stick to the chain. If the anchor chain is dirty we have powerful water jets in the recess in the ships hull in which the anchor rests. In Ajaccio we anchored in gravel and thus the two anchors came home nice and clean.\n\nMonte Carlo was gearing up for the yearly Grand Prix and that meant that the regular dock and tender dock was not available. The dock was taken up by the Seabourn Spirit and two sailing vessels that were all chartered and were staying for the duration of the Grand Prix. (Finishing on Sunday the 27th.) Also the tender dock in the Monte Carlo marina was not available as that side of the Marina was screened off for the races.\n\nThus we had to anchor at the other side of the Oceanic Museum and tender into Fontveille Harbor. In this case that was even better as it brought the ship about half a mile further away from down town and that meant less noise. Even when at anchor and more then 3000 feet away from the shore, the noise can still be ear splitting. Part of the race goes under the big building on the waterfront and the half open tunnel acts as a sort of loudspeaker booming noise over the water. It can be so loud that you can not sit on the deck. Fontveille is a little further away and so the noise is much less, although still very pronounced.\n\nIt was a nice and almost windless day and thus a good day for a tender service as there was no sea swell. The swell and waves in the Mediterranean are all wind generated, so if there is no wind, there are no waves. Only the oceans have the long rolling waves that can stay on for days on end and roll in regardless of the local weather. The only thing that we had to content with was the wake generated by pleasure boats passing by the gangway at full speed. There are a lot of rich people in Monte Carlo who like to spend money on fancy toys including powerful speedboats and fast yachts. They take these out for a spin outside the harbor and the drivers are not hampered by the slightest from of common sense. They race by the ship at short distance and create so much wake at the tender platform that we have to stop the tender service as the tender movement alongside the platform becomes too dangerous. I wish these people would use their boats for what they are meant for. Keep them alongside the dock in the marina, for parties and to display skimpy bikiniâ€™s on the top deck.\n\nMost of our guests preferred to go on tour here but the crew was highly excited with the prospect to see some of the circus that surrounds a Grand Prix. Although the races itself are on Sunday, there was test driving going on and that can also be very spectacular. You never know if somebody will crash. A ticket for the day to get inside the circuit was about 40 eurosâ€™ and working schedules were re-arranged where necessary to make sure that all had a chance to have a look. You really have to buy a ticket as each possible viewpoint that is over looking the circuit is screened off also the pathways higher up the hill. It seems that even the people who own apartments overlooking the circuit have to pay “viewing rent” if there are more people on their balcony than that belong to the apartment.\n\nWe sailed in the early evening from the anchorage for our next port of Call Ajaccio Corsica.\n\nLivorno is not too far North from Civitavecchia and we sailed through the night along the Italian coast with a speed of about 15 knots to get to the pilot station at 05.30. Again there was a parade of cruise ships and ferryâ€™s going in. The Spanish Oceanic was in port as well as the Carnival Freedom, not to mention 5 or 6 large ferries that came in from the islands of Sardinia and Corsica and the French port of Toulon. Our approach to the port was enlivened by a cargo ship who decided to first cross our bow and then to stop right on our course track. Legally nothing wrong with that but from a point of good seamanship it did not make sense. Nobody in their right mind is going to sit right in the middle of a port approach, but that ship did so, so we had to sail around her.\n\nThis time we were assigned one of the cargo berths and the port had arranged shuttle buses for the guests to get them out of the docks. This is a very busy port and everywhere we saw ships being discharged and container and tanker ships coming in and leaving. Entrance and exit to the port is a narrow entrance on the south side of the breakwater and you have to make two sharp turns with the ship to get into the centre of the harbor. Those turns are comparable with the sharp turns you make while in a car trying to go from level to level in a parking garage ashore.\n\nOnce again a sunny day and most guests where gone for the whole day. Only a few, who had been there, seen it and bought the T shirt, decided to stay on board and enjoy shipboard life. With a nearly empty ship, it was for me a great opportunity to do some extensive drilling. Not every port allows drills but Livorno does as long as we inform all the proper authorities. Livorno has three different authorities who are involved. First there is Pac-Livorno. That is the organization that controls the movements in the port. Then there is the SIS (Ships Information Services) whose main duty it seems to be to collect statistical data and then there is the pilot station, who also wants to know what is going on. Permission has to be asked as well 2 days in advance from the Harbor master, which office then produces a number of forms, to be signed by the captain. These forms indicate that the captain assumes all liability for damage caused by the lifeboats in the water. As there is more chance of the stone docks causing damage to the lifeboats than the other way around, I have not much of a problem with these forms.\n\nToday we had a simulated oil spill, with the oil going on fire, which went out of control and resulted in all having to abandon the ship. The rule for abandoning ship is that everybody has to be in the boats and the boats in the water, within 30 minutes of the alarm going off. We managed 8 minutes this time with the crew from lifeboat stowed to lifeboat away in the water. Of those 8, only three minutes were needed to lower the boat, so that would leave 27 minutes for mustering the guests and placing them in the boats in a real emergency. After these drills there is an extensive debriefing as there are always things to be learned and items to be improved upon.\n\nTomorrow we are in Monte Carlo with the Grand Prix races.\n\nA bright and early arrival this morning, sailing into the port by 6 am. Although our official arrival time was 8 am., it is better to have the long tours on the road by 7 am.; otherwise we never get them back on time in the evening. There is a saying in the Dutch language “all roads lead to Rome” and they do, but a traffic jam is most likely a Roman invention as well. Getting in and out of the Eternal city is a form of controlled mayhem and getting the tours on the road an hour earlier does help. Especially with at least 5000 other cruise guests in buses on the road as well.\n\nThere was a whole parade of cruise ships at the pilot station. Ahead of us was the Insignia with 700 guests on board. For this ship Civitavecchia is the change over port and that made her the first ship going in, as with luggage to be offloaded, it had to be early. Behind us was the Brilliance of the Seas with a maximum of 2400 guests on board, followed a little later by the Voyager of the Seas with a maximum of 3800 guests on board. All these people wanted to see something of the area, with most of them going to Rome or the surrounding country side, so a busy day.\n\nWith the increase of cruise ships calls, there is the need for more docking space and the port has embarked on an aggressive expansion project. The breakwater (the pier that protects the port from the waves) has already been extended with 1500 feet and another 1500 feet has been projected. The waste land along the coast is being filled in and new docks are constructed. As they have made not up their minds yet completely about where the cruise ships will dock from now on, the new docks have been laid out in such a way, that when almost complete, a decision will be made if it will be a cruise ship dock or a containership dock. Therefore there are no fixed passenger terminals yet, only re-inforced tents. These will stay until a final plan has been worked out. For us the tents where not necessary, as our guests could walk directly from the gangway to the buses.\n\nOn departure we had the compulsory tug again who pulled us of the dock and into open waters. A tugboat is required on departure and I thought that if I have to pay for a tug, I might as well use the tug. So instead of swinging off the berth, which is the normal procedure and the easy way out for the tug, (the ships thrusters do most of the work) I had the tug pull the Veendam astern for about 2000 feet. It is possible to swing off the berth; the harbor entrance gives me 150 feet clearance on the bow and the same on the stern, but why do so if you have miles of open sea, just 2000 feet away from you. So the tugboat had to work for the money this time.\n\nOnce outside we headed North West for our next port of call Livorno, with yet another early arrival, as we have full day tours to Florence and Pisa.\n\nIn Messina I like to arrive early. If I can get the ship into the port before 6 am., then there is no delay caused by ferry traffic. There are at least 10 ferries leaving from Messina each hour (and also 10 arriving) and their schedule takes precedence over any other traffic. If I get the Veendam through the breakwater just before 6 am, than I am just in a gap between the scheduled ferries. This time it worked out great. At 05.50 a ferry came out of the port and at 05.55 the Veendam sailed in.\n\nWe were the only cruise ship in port and as it was another glorious day, the guests really enjoyed themselves. Messina was heavily rebuilt after the Second World War and much of the old town is gone but there are a few churches and other sights in walking distance. Those guests who decided not to go on tour had also sufficient things to see during our morning stop. Messina is only a short stop as we have to get to Rome on time, which is one of the highlights of the cruise.\n\nAll tours were back on time and I was ready to leave at exactly 1300 hrs. when the pilot sprang a surprise on me with the announcement that a whole examination board was joining the ship. Without my knowledge, the Veendam had been selected by the harbor master to be the ship of choice to examine a new pilot. Normally I sail the ship in and out Messina myself and the pilot takes care of the communication with the local traffic. (My Sicilian is non existent and most local ferry captains speak very limited English, let alone Dutchâ€¦â€¦â€¦â€¦â€¦ so I leave the communication to the pilot) Now we had to do it differently as there is not much to exam if the captain is doing it all and the pilot, who is to be examined, is just standing here.\n\nApart from the â€“to be licensed pilot- a 2nd and a 3rd pilot boarded. Followed by the senior pilot, followed by the harbor master. After much handshaking I was given the green light to proceed. So I brought the ship of the pier and then handed over the “conn” (conducting the safe passage of the vessel, while the master remains in charge) to the new pilot and we sailed out of port. As soon as the ship was clear of the breakwater, two course changes later, the harbor master and senior pilot left the ship. The exam had lasted less than 5 minutes and a new pilot had been licensed.\n\nWe sailed in the afternoon past the Volcano Stromboli again. There was not much activity going on, just a small plume of smoke coming out of the top. But as the sun shone on the mountain, everybody could have a good look. In the mean time the Veendam was running at full speed. Even at 20 knots it takes 30 minutes to sail by Stromboli so more than enough time for the guests to get a good view, take some pictures and listen to the narration of the Port Informer. I had to keep the speed up as I had to time the arrival at Civitavecchia correctly. Including the Veendam there were going to be three other cruise ships in port, including two “apartments of the seas”, all arriving 15 minutes apart."
