        "text": "OP\n\ncruiser\n\nJoined:\n\nPosts: 43\n\nI was going through photos and came across pictures taken on the Fairwind and the Fairsky. Although it is so mmany years ago, the memories linger. The Italian service, the wonderful food, especially the buffet on the promenade.\n\nThe old Fairwind was really worn out at the time, but she was a real lady at sea.......not like the current floating hotels. Does anyone out there remember the Sitmar experience......sigh. Gee, I can even remember the Captain....Rodolfo Potenzoni, whi was the master on both ships....short in stature, tall in personality.\n\nOh the memories....how about you?\n\ncruiser\n\nJoined:\n\nPosts: 8,981\n\nYES oh YES. I always liked cruising and had been on many ships. Then Ken and I married and the Fairwind was the first ship that Ken and I went on together. I loved that ship and that line. It made a cruise monster out of Ken. The beautiful decks etc. True \"ladies\" is so well put. The food was truly incredible and the buffets they had in the kitchen do you remember those? How about the white glove afternoon teas in the forward lounge. Those were the days.\n\nWonderful line, old ships even then, but who cared. I always make the connection between Sitmars, Fairwind and Fairsky and the Song of Flower. Both older ships without all the walk in closets etc but a certain charm and style you cant match with the new ships. This is the type of thing that cannot be put into words so others who have not experienced the grace of these ships can understand.\n\nThen again some sailed on Sitmar and the Song and called them \"old tubs\". We are certainly all different.\n\ncruiser\n\nJoined:\n\nPosts: 20\n\nThose were the days.......I think we cruised twice on the Fairwind and twice on the Fairsea , one thing I do remember is going down the wrong set of stairs to the dinning rooms and running into a dead end. Maybe it was just me, but I did that alot. The service was great and the food was wonderful, but I also cruised on Holland America old Vendam and Volendam when they were class acts too. Looking back we really thought it couldn't get any better, we thought the small staterooms were just fine, now we have to have at least 300 sq. ft. and a walk in closet, spoiled? I guess thats what Radisson and Seabourn has done to us, but I think Princess , Holland America and even RCCL has just let all the good stuff of the past go by the wayside.\n\nRemember Royal Cruise Line, we only cruised one time , but that was also a very good line.\n\nLobster and cavier??? You could have as much as you wanted....\n\nMemories, aren't they Great....\n\nSandy\n\np.s. it's when we can't remember that worries me!! ;)\n\ncruiser\n\nJoined:\n\nPosts: 388\n\nOur first cruise was on the Sitmar Line's Fairsea so I do remember that ship very well. It was the most exciting thing boarding that ship. Still have the old photos that were taken on the ship although they are fading fast!! The Captain on Silversea (I've forgotten his name) Silver Wind remembered taking us out to see when we were about to encounter a huricane off the coast of Mexico. We went to Zihuatano (Sp.) instead of Puerto Vallarta and there was very little there but a small village. This was on the Fairwind, I think. Yes, lots of memories of those old ships.\n\nJean\n\n\"Never pass up an opportunity\n\nto go for a joyride\""
