Ships Leisure will provide ship management services for the two vessels after partnering with A&K Travel Group.\n\n“The idea of combining the unparalleled onboard service that Crystal Cruises is known for with the extraordinary tailor-made experiences Abercrombie & Kent has been successfully providing for our guests for the past 60 years fills me with excitement, enthusiasm and pride,\" said Kent, who will now become co-chairman of A&K Travel Group and Crystal Cruises.\n\nCrystal Symphony and Crystal Serenity will now resume service in 2023 after undergoing extensive refurbishments."
