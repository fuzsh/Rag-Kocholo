        "text": "Silver Wind is one of the first duo of ships entering service for Silversea Cruises in 1994.\n\nBelow is the new Silversea funnel marking, a change from the beginnings of the company when the 'S'-logo was presented on the funnels.\n\nSilver Whisper and Silver Shadow look a lot like their two forerunners, resembling the same profile, only bigger. Silver Whisper was named by Marzia Lefebre D'Ovidio, wife of Silversea Cruises' CEO. The ship made her first cruise in june 2001 and two years later she was used as an accomodationship for the celebrations of the 300-year anniversary of St.-Petersburgh. This charter was signed by Vladimir Putin himself. Also, in 2004 she was used as a hotelship in Athens for the Olympic Games, as were her older sisters.\n\nSilversea Cruises is a very upmarket line, offering next to one of the highest passenger to crew ratio's in the industry a lot of extra's for their passengers. All beverages are included in the fare, except for specialities from the Conoisseurs List. Also included are things like port charges, travel insurance and complimentary shore-events during every voyage. Passengers can choose from nine different pillows for their use in the cabin and also it is possible to give your preference for the soft or the firm side of the matrass. Those matrasses and pillows are of course also custom made for the company. All ships have been updated between 2008 and 2010 to match the companies newest ship Silver Spirit that was again an enlarged version of the Silver Shadow and Silver Whisper, measuring 36.000 tons and she entered service in 2009. In 2017, the line added their ninth ship, which is now also their largest with a tonnage measurement just above 40.000. Her name is Silver Muse.\n\nIn june of 2018, Silversea Cruises became a part of the Royal Caribbean family when the industry giant bought 66,7 percent of the company. Silversea keeps running under its own management, but will be able to grow more intensively with the investment of one of the industries largest companies. Of course it also means that Royal Caribbean can start tapping into the luxury market.\n\nSilversea Expeditions"
