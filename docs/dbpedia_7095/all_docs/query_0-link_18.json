        "text": "A&K Travel Group Ltd., the pioneering travel company owned by Geoffrey Kent and Heritage (the industrial holding company chaired by Manfredi Lefebvre d'Ovidio), has acquired the luxury cruise vessels Crystal Serenity and Crystal Symphony.\n\nThe two ships will resume service in 2023 after undergoing extensive refurbishment and will operate under the award-winning “Crystal Cruises” brand that has also been acquired by A&K Travel Group Ltd.\n\n“I am thrilled to start this new chapter and to be back in an industry that has always had, and always will have a special place in my heart. Thirty-five years ago, my family acquired control of Sitmar Cruises, building three of the first purpose-built cruise ships, and 30 years ago my family pioneered a new way of cruising. Our goal was to deliver the best experience, pampering guests from all over the world with around-the-clock butler service and extraordinary culinary experiences. Selling the cruise business that belonged to my family for a quarter of a century was a difficult decision, as I knew I would miss this industry immensely. Therefore, when the opportunity arose to acquire Crystal Cruises, I did not think about it twice. Having next to me my incredible friend and inspiring leader Geoffrey Kent makes this venture even more enjoyable,” said Manfredi Lefebvre d’Ovidio, Co-Chairman of A&K Travel Group Ltd., Crystal Cruises and Abercrombie & Kent.\n\nBrief Description:\n\nIn the extraordinary general meeting held on August 31, 2021, Centricus Acquisition Corp (Nasdaq: CENH, CENHW, CENHU) shareholders voted to approve its proposed business combination with Arqit Quantum Inc (Nasdaq: ARQQ, ARQQW).\n\nAbout Centricus Acquisition Corp.\n\nCentricus Acquisition Corp., chaired by Manfredi Lefebvre d’Ovidio, raised $345 million in its IPO in February 2021, which was upsized due to strong demand and included the underwriters’ full over-allotment option. Centricus Acquisition Corp. was founded by the Monaco-based investment group Heritage, the London-based global investment firm Centricus, and Carlo Calabria.\n\nAbout Arqit\n\nArqit supplies a unique quantum encryption Platform-as-a-Service which makes the communications links of any networked device secure against current and future forms of attack – even from a quantum computer. Arqit’s product, QuantumCloud™, enables any device to download a lightweight software agent of less than 200 lines of code, which can create keys in partnership with any other device. The keys are computationally secure, don’t exist until the moment they are needed and can never be known by a third party. QuantumCloud™ can create limitless volumes of keys in limitless group sizes and can regulate the secure entrance and exit of a device in a group. The addressable market for QuantumCloud™ is every connected device."
