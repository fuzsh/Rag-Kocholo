        "text": "Following a very successful first cruise with CMV on the Magellan last October, I had absolutely no hesitation in booking another cruise with the company.\n\nAs these things tend to happen with me the cruise sort of found me rather than the other way around, being restricted on dates having a school age child options that don’t cost a small fortune are quite difficult to come by even in there enlightened times where 2 million British people take a cruise every year. The Columbus fit the bill in terms of dates and itinerary.\n\nThe Columbus and I have to an extent led parallel shipping lives, she was under construction when I first become interested in ships back in 1988 and entered service the following year as one of the very first new build cruise ships I remember.\n\nOriginally intended to be named Fair Majesty, the ship was ordered by Sitmar Cruises but during construction the company was sold to P&O and the ship was delivered as Star Princess for P&O’s American subsidiary Princess Cruises.\n\nA product of the Chantiers de l’Atlantique Shipyard in France, which was the choice of builder for the legendary French Line, when delivered the ship was one of the largest in the world and although smaller than Chantier’s final ocean liner project the France which at the time of the Star Princess’s delivery was in her heyday at NCL’s Norway.\n\nThe ship was named in Ft Lauderdale on 23rd March 1989 by Audrey Hepburn\n\nThe ship remained with Princess until 1997 when she was given the unenviable task of replacing P&O’s much-loved liner the s.s. Canberra. Thankfully she was bestowed with a suitable name from P&O’s back catalogue – Arcadia.\n\nTimes were changing however, and UK travel companies were starting to dabble in cruising with Thomson, Airtours and First Choice all chartering ships to start their own lines. P&O were initially unphased by the competition and some would rightly say down right rude about package holiday passengers not being cruise passenger types, but soon realised that something needed to be done to compete, so the decision was taken to start a new brand, Ocean Village in 2003.\n\nThe Arcadia was selected as their first ship and given a thorough makeover to give her a more laid back and contemporary feel. ‘The cruise for people that don’t do cruising’ was the slogan, the target audience was 30 to 50 years old and with the cruise concept of freedom and flexibility on board regarding food, clothing, and entertainment. A secondary target was families, with extensive family facilities.\n\nThe ship operated for Ocean Village for 7 years sailing the Med in the summer and the Caribbean in the winter.\n\nFollowing the closure of Ocean Village, the ship sailed for refit for the Australian market and another P&O Subsidiary – P&O Cruises Australia where she became Pacific Pearl.\n\nDespite expanding rapidly, the Australian fleet was starting to age and the company looked to dispose of older units with the Pacific Pearl cited for removal from the fleet.\n\nIn 2017 she was acquired by Global Cruise Lines and chartered to CMV to become their flagship Columbus. The ship was handed over in Singapore and sailed to Rotterdam for final commissioning.\n\nThe Columbus homeports in Tilbury and uses for former Ocean Liner terminal at the port which hosted Transatlantic liners until the general demise of the trade. Thankfully the terminal survived post closure and was resurrected in 1995 as a cruise terminal its brick terminal with some lovely stained glass windows brought to life once more with ships mooring alongside the floating wooden landing stage on the Thames.\n\nCMV use several different ports around the UK and as I explained in my last article these tend to be paired up so that cruises from Liverpool for example call at Dublin as their first port of call to load Irish passengers. In the case of Tilbury, Rotterdam is used to collect passengers from mainland Europe. Its all part of the very clever business model that CMV employ to ensure high load factors and by operating from aspiring cruise ports they can secure in some cases exclusive or near exclusive use of facilities\n\nThe port of Tilbury is much like Liverpool in that it is largely accessed through locks and it has a huge amount of space, over 1,000 acres in fact and 56 operational berths. The cruise terminal as I mentioned is accessed via a floating landing stage.\n\nWe arrived at the port in time for loading at around 12:30 and following the well sign posted route we ended up at the brand-new long stay car park which is quite literally across the road from the terminal. Cars enter the car park, queue for instruction before moving forwards to a shed where luggage is taken. The driver is then directed to a parking space before all passengers board a somewhat unnecessary shuttle bus for the 30 second transfer to the terminal. An angle grinder would probably make light work of chopping a hole in the fencing around the site where a gate could be erected and passengers could simply walk the hundred yards or so to the terminal entrance but I’m sure in time the process will be tweaked\n\nWhen we arrived at the terminal our luggage label colour was already starting the boarding process so with heath waver completed, passports checked, and credit card swiped it was a quick walk through the body scanner and onto the landing stage and the ship. All told car to cabin in under 25 minutes. It was all very efficient and stress free, rare in travel these days.\n\nOnce onboard we headed for the cabin and let ourselves in. It was an inside cabin on deck 10 aft 15 yards or so from the outer deck. It was a great spot and the cabin itself was excellent clearly having benefited from carpeting and soft furnishing changes in the April 2017 refit.\n\nWhat amazed me about the cabin was the amount of storage space, there must have been 20 drawers in that cabin as well as several double wardrobe’s worth of hanging space. This of course is nod to the ships Sitmar roots, a company whose bread and butter for many years was the liner trade with long voyages the norm. Interestingly Sitmar operated cruises out of Australia for several years so the Australian link for the ship took her right back to her original owners’ heartland.\n\nOnce we had been acquainted with our cabin steward it was up to the dreaded self-service restaurant to acclimatise ourselves with the cuisine. Located two decks up aft of our cabin we were ideally placed for the short walk up.\n\nI hadn’t found any photos online which really showed the plantation self-service restaurant in all its glory – yes there were plenty of the servery area but none really of the scale of the place. It was much larger than I had given it credit for and there was plenty of seating, what’s more the tie up with Whittard and Douwe Egberts meant that you were guaranteed a good brew! The food was fresh, tasty and plentiful and whilst it wasn’t going to feature heavily on our list of places to visit on the ship it served its purpose well.\n\nAfter lunch we had a look around and went back to the cabin to find our cases had arrived, so we unpacked.\n\nLifeboat drill was a hybrid of meet at the muster station for briefing and then out to the boats for assembly, it worked well and gave a measure of the vast expanse of open deck under the boats on deck 7.\n\nWe left Tilbury is superb weather conditions and sailed down the windy Thames past the London Gateway cargo terminal and out to sea.\n\nWe had booked early sitting for dinner and on CMV it is really early, doors open at 5:30 for 5:45. The choice of food and the quality were superb, very much the equal if not better than P&O and certainly more favourable than Marella, throughout the cruise there was plenty of variety to encourage everyone to try something a bit different – it was way beyond my expectations in all honesty and really was special.\n\nThe Waterfront restaurant is a lovely spot, very cleverly reconstructed with lots of alcoves and mid height walls making the space look far more intimate than it was. It also looked far more modern than one would expect from a ship of Columbus’s years much in the same way that Magellan’s did.\n\nThere was a mixed entertainment show in the evening which was good – there was more British entertainment staff than I recall on Magellan and indeed that was true of the ship generally – the cruise director was veteran Iain Bagshaw who we last encountered on Thomson Celebration out of Newcastle a few years ago.\n\nThe next day was a sea day and we easily slipped into our sea day routines, I attended the excellent lectures which were an introduction to Norway and one about wildlife. There was of course the usual port talk which was very good as well.\n\nWe dined in the main restaurant again at lunch and the menu was again top notch.\n\nIt was the first of two formal evenings and a straw count revealed that just over half of the men I saw were dressed in formal wear with the rest in suits which is normal really. The captain’s cocktail and welcome parade took place in the Palladium show lounge, a sizable room with a really big stage and an LED screen to aid performances. It was a good room, although nowhere near as nice as the one on Magellan.\n\nThe sparkling wine and canapés flowed freely and the event was well worth attending. A Gala dinner followed which was again – really very good indeed.\n\nOur first port of call was Eidfjord. A heatwave had engulfed Europe and we were anticipating high temperatures and blue skies but when we put the TV on the bridgecam channel we were somewhat disappointed to see fog! However, we despatched our spy to the aft deck and he came back to reveal that it was actually hot and sunny, the low cloud very quickly disappeared\n\nEidfjord itself is very pretty, nestled in between mountains with picture perfect houses, hotels and shops, its easy to walk around and quite flat too. There is a stunning river that flows into the lake but as my son found out whilst attempting to swim, the water is cold!\n\nThe entertainment in the evening was a UK guest comedian, the usual type of gags as experienced on-board ship he was perfectly good.\n\nWe sailed out through the stunning Hardanger fjord towards the North Sea to before cutting through the various islands and inland again towards Sognefjord and Flam.\n\nFlam is a picture postcard kind of place, from the stern of the ship you looked out on the stunning natural scenery with mountains and waterfall and the town which is no more than 500 meters in total in length and width but contained within are souvenir shops, cafes, restaurants and the Flam railway museum.\n\nThe Flam railway itself is the highlight here, it takes about an hour each way through the most magnificent scenery I have ever witnessed, whilst not cheap at £65 each it is more than worth it, it really does leave you speechless.\n\nThe cruise director was the main act for the entertainment this evening – a first in my experience although I have seen cruise directors take part in some of the shows before now. Iain is a magician and his act was very good and well received although in all honesty, I really wanted to be outside so as soon as he had finished I shot out onto the open decks to watch the sun setting and a pink/peach tint to the sky was a magical glow to a wonderful day.\n\nThe final port of call was Bergen. Once Norway’s capital and the recipient of rain on over 300 days a year we sailed into glorious sun and temperatures that were bordering on ‘too much’, at one point the temperature in the town reached 33 degrees. It was so hot in fact that whilst exploring I went inside several shops to take advantage of their aircon. It was quite something to take shelter in Bergen’s tourist shops many of them selling knitwear and seriously technical waterproof jackets.\n\nBergen itself is a pleasant city with a bustling harbour with sightseeing and commuter catamarans a plenty.\n\nWe sailed away at 5pm bound for the open sea and home.\n\nIt was the final formal night of the cruise and again time to dress up. Dinner was of course excellent, and the comedian was back for another performance. There was a farewell party in the main atrium of the ship which is spread over three levels. It was festooned with flags and balloons for the occasion.\n\nThis is one area of the ship that could use a bit of a lift. The carpet brings it to life with colour, but the staircase wall is one of the most boring walls I’ve ever seen. It’s so plain and its always been the same I would dearly love to see it used for – anything really.\n\nThe final day of the cruise was a sea day as we headed back to Tilbury and particularly in the morning the weather was sunny but the sea was quite choppy, around force 5 to 6 but she handled it admirably like the deep hulled, thoroughbred that she is although the outer decks on deck 7 were closed and pools closed.\n\nIt was another day in the theatre for me with 2 lectures to attend and the second Mary Poppins film shown to quite a good number of passengers. The film was so good I skipped lunch although I did go and grab a couple of fresh rolls with minute steak on them afterwards.\n\nAfter the second lecture I spent a very pleasant hour and a half reclining on a padded lounger on the back of deck 10 reading before getting ready for one last dinner. I’ll admit by this point I was ready for something simple to eat so I selected a Santa Fe salad and it was perfect, very enjoyable.\n\nThe show team gave their performance of Rock and Roll numbers for the final show of the cruise and they were excellent, perhaps in this show more than they others they were able to exercise their talent. The lead vocalists were excellent, and the dancers tired me out just watching them. We enjoyed on last cocktail during the show. We bought a package of 10 cocktails on the second night a bargain at £39 and enough for one each for 5 nights of course for myself and my wife. I tried a different one each night and they were all excellent and cheaper than beer.\n\nWe decided to opt for express disembarkation which meant we didn’t have to put our cases out and we would be the first off, the ship the following morning. We did this for several reasons. The ship was due to arrive at 08:00 and our designated time to get off the ship with our luggage taken ashore for us would be 10:20. As we had to be out of our cabin by 07:00 that would have meant waiting around a ship full of people at the end of their holiday sad because they had to go home and that’s not a pleasant experience especially as the facilities would be closed. In addition, we had a 4-hour drive home.\n\nWe said goodbye and thank you to our cabin steward and headed down to deck 5 for disembarkation but on the way down noticed that the restaurant wasn’t very busy, so we went in there for breakfast. I hadn’t been in the restaurant for breakfast until today largely because id either missed it time wise or grabbed a quick bite elsewhere but it really was very pleasant, I wasn’t particularly hungry so had muesli but the cooked breakfast looked very good and that is a really important thing in the British market.\n\nAfter breakfast we joined many other people in the atrium for disembarkation, express was a popular choice seemingly and there were lots of people on all three levels of the atrium, thankfully the ship was cleared for disembarkation around 08:20 and the crowds quickly cleared. Once off the ship it was a simple process of walking through the terminal to the front, but it was anticipated that passengers would then join the shuttle bus back to the car park.\n\nThere was only one bus and it was of the type that was full of seats so of little use to passengers with cases so most decided to take matters into their own hands and walk out of the terminal complex, across the street and into the car park otherwise they would have waited ages to catch the not so practical bus to travel the hundred yards or so to the car park – remember at the beginning I said an angle grinder would make a nice hole in the car park fence? Add to that a zebra crossing and the whole parking situation would be just that bit better but as I said this was new to them.\n\nColumbus is a fantastic ship, her interior design is a mix of old and new, the refurbishment of this vessel was clearly not done on the same scale as the Magellan although the circumstances of the two ships change of trade was a little different but nevertheless the main restaurant, bars, self-service buffet and cabins were all refurbished to a very high standard.\n\nIt’s the space that really strikes you on this ship, the ceilings are high, the passageways are broad and there is plenty of lifts, she is extremely comfortable. And that really is a major unsung bonus of Columbus – she measures 63,786 gross registered tonnes (GRT) and has a nominal capacity of 1,400 passengers. What this means is that GRT per passenger is 45.56.\n\nAs I’ve said many times on this blog the British don’t mind an older ship and they certainly prefer a roomier vessel and aren’t bothered too much by fancy bells and whistles\n\nThe trick to a successful British ship is good food, good entertainment and plenty of smaller spaces, cosy bars, reading rooms and home comforts.\n\nI am totally sold on the Columbus. In advance of this cruise I was so convinced that I would like her that I booked a 14-night Baltic Capitals cruise on her for 2020 – I’m very happy that I did now!"
