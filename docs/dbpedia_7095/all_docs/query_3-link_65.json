Goldberg, TravelPage.com, Cruise Editor, and Christopher E. Smith, TravelPage.com, Associate Cruise Editor\n\nNever mind that it had its origins carrying coal...and got into the passenger business the old fashioned way by carrying immigrants and displaced persons...by 1972 Sitmar was in the North American cruise business and immediately made a grand impression on people with their FAIR ships...\n\nAcross the world two FAIR ships cruised for the Australian trade...One of the ships was a former British troopship...converted to a high class immigrant ship and upgraded slightly to cater for a crowd of rough Australian partiers. That was the FAIRSTAR. Smaller and less rowdy was the FAIRSKY, originally an American escort aircraft carrier and later an Italian manned immigrant ship displaced by the aircraft and now also cruising. Sitmar sold that ship in 1978.\n\nBy the early 1980s when Sitmars plans for a new ship turned into a building contract, it was everybodys guess that FAIRSKY would be her name. They were right and the name of the new ship was no secret. When Sitmar Cruises told the world that the new ship was going to be a 38,000 gross tonner, some of the cruise trade and many of the companys past passengers looked on in horror because it looked like an unprecedented leap into gigantisicm...for the line which came to great popularity in the USA and Canada with the 25,000 tonners FAIRSEA and FAIRWIND.\n\nFans of the company just KNEW the new ship could not possibly offer them the style, ambience and warm coziness of those twins...And 38,000 tons seemed REALLY too big for a cruise ship back in 1980, when the cruising giants were the 39,000+ton OCEANIC and the 44,000 ton CANBERRA. Yes, Royal Caribbean had a new ship coming into service in 1982, the nearly 38,000 ton SONG OF AMERICA, but about all that ship and the Sitmar twins had in common at the time was they all floated and both offered vacations at sea...The styles and offerings of the two companies were totally different. Sitmars fans and many industry observers felt that such a ship would simply be too big for the traditional cruise product offered by Sitmar...SIZE - would be the first hurdle for the new FAIRSKY...even though the OCEANIC and CANBERRA were bigger than the planned newbuild, those two very popular cruise ships, like so many still cruising full time back then, had been designed with additional purposes and uses in mind...but this one wasnt...this new cruise giant was designed to do one thing CRUISE, to take passengers into the sun on winter itineraries and to Alaska in the summer on cruises ranging from 7 to 14 days.\n\nA big surprise for the interested was the location of the yard chosen to build her...It was the CNIM ...the Constructions Navales et Industrielles de la Mediterranee near Toulon, France. This ship was to be the first major cruise liner to come from a FRENCH shipyard...the first major French-built passenger ship for overseas trades to be built in a lot of years... but maybe the biggest surprise of all was her propulsion system, for their giant liner, Sitmar ordered good old fashioned steam turbines, and as of this writing, this ship remains the last big turbine steamer ever built, a distinction shes likely to hold forever.\n\nAs the new FAIRSKY was being built, P & O stole nearly all of the thunder of Sitmars new ship with the building of the trend setting ROYAL PRINCESS...a 44,000 ton giant with none but outside cabins and two decks of cabins with private verandas..the ROYAL PRINCESS...and what differences abide in these two contemporary ships of similar sizes and capacities...Then Sitmar gave everyone a surprise...when the 38,000 tonner was building, it turned out that she would not come in at 38,000 tons, she would be 46,000 tons, the worlds largest cruise ship!!! And so she would remain for a very short time, until Carnivals Superliners the HOLIDAY, CELEBRATION and JUBILEE, topped the FAIRSKYs size a year later. After only some five years as Sitmars immensely popular FAIRSKY, Sitmar sold out to P & O and was merged into Princess Cruises. The FAIRSKY became the SKY PRINCESS and she is still pleasing a lot of people.\n\nThat said, there are also quite a few people the SKY PRINCESS does not please...and for that, blame both staff on board and corporate headquarters in Los Angeles. Like it or not...its the people you sail with that make a cruise a wonderful experience or help you to turn it into a trial...and the most important people you encounter on ANY cruise is the crew...not stately Mrs. Van Tassel and Mrs. Gottrocks, bejewelled beauties offering swank parties to the favored few...its the crew...officers, staff and crew...right down to the deck boys you encounter while trying not to trip over their mops, hoses and pails.\n\nAnd it is HERE....in the people department, where the SKY PRINCESS has her greatest failings...Some of the staff was great, some of them even cordial but not many of them, Im afraid. Most of those at the Pursers information desk were cheerful, helpful and accommodating and the shore excursion staff were great. Nor could we complain about service in the dining room where cordial Italian Line, Home Lines and Sitmar veterans staff the management positions. Warm, welcoming and friendly was cabin service...in fact it went way beyond typical service for cruise ship cabins and approached that in a small luxury hotel.\n\nCruise Director Shane Stewart is a gem, a delight and not only is he very good at his job, he tries hard to make his department the ships best...He and his coterie were friendly, available and ready to mingle. But many of the people we met elsewhere left us cold...and the insolence of some of the Filipino deck and bar stewards left us aghast..Actually, with the exception of a couple of the Filipina bar stewardesses, we were distressed at the rudeness and lack of work ethic of the barmen and their British barmaids but perhaps the cue for this ships generally cold attitude rests with her British officers, steely, aloof and seemingly uncomfortable with their paying guests...I too often wondered of them Why are they here? until a few days later when I began to ask myself Why am I here on this ship?\n\nYou need to understand something about the SKY PRINCESS straight off...though massive just 15 years ago, ..SKY PRINCESS, is no megaliner today and her proportions strike many people as small!!! So her public rooms are not of the breathtaking sort nor are they, with the exception of the wonderfully decorated Veranda Lounge, anything of a decorative triumph...in fact some of them are just ugly, unfortunate spaces where the ships operators are able to place tables and chairs...At least the chairs, and some of the public rooms are comfortable, reasonably proportioned and pleasant enough to pass a quarter of an hour or so. Lets start aft with that unfortunate Veranda Lounge.\n\nI call it unfortunate because aft on Promenade Deck, this expensively decorated honey of a room, with its high ceiling, pleasant dance floor and convivial bar is a traffic pattern more than anything else...What makes the Veranda Lounge unfortunate is its use as a place to eat during breakfast and lunch when the lounge overflows with buffet diners in search of a place to eat...Its tables at those mealtimes all too often overflowed with the detritus of strangers meals, nothing youd particularly want to see...But worse than that during our three week cruise..its major problem was a matter of music. One of the combos that played in here was a trio of guitarists and their twangy sounds and selections could not fail but to send us running for the exits along with most of those brave enough to be still seated in there when that group of three walked up to the bandstand...Nor was the other trio much better, though attempting a repertoire of big band era favorites, they should have held us spellbound...we love those tunes and rhythms, yet this trio was almost as bad as the other...The Piano Lounge, a room verboten to smokers, has more than enough space and has been recently refurbished in a nondescript style....with tables too high for convivial chatting...board games or snacks come to mind...but its decor is neither offensive nor is it memorable...and unless you like the pianists selections, or are a fan of the many daily quizzes SKY PRINCESS cruise staff host (most of them in here and ALWAYS, it seems, in time to occupy First Sitting passengers while Second Sitting watches the show).\n\nTheres a quiet tiny bar adjacent, the Melody, and it seems to win no custom from the paying guests...attracting only the nightly visits from officers and staff who seem to intuit that no passengers will interact with them here. These rooms, as well as a shop aft and one further forward, open onto the main indoor passageway on this deck...a thoroughfare crowded more by merchandise, unchanging displays of wine and artwork you can bid on at auctions than by passengers. Nearby, tucked behind a wine sales kiosk and a table strewn with merchandise for purchase, is the Pizzeria, but the Filippino pizzamaker in here had no talent for the stuff we know to be pizza so one visit was more than enough for our curious palates.\n\nFurther forward, the Promenade Lounge, once ideal for board games and bored games (people watching, taking a load off, etc.) By day is crowded with MORE shoppers fingering whatever goods Shop Manageress has ordered taken there for display...while crowding the aft wall can often be merchandise from yet another sales room. The forward end of this lounge, a particularly ugly one badly lit by those awful fluorescents, as I remember it, is the photographers shop...Beyond the forward stairs is The Sky Princess showroom, a space designed when showrooms also served as lounges, and it might appeal as it slopes down towards the stage but even a very costly refurbishing has not done much to improve sight lines during evening productions....which is a shame, because the song and dance troupe on board was refreshingly earnest, and a delight to watch.\n\nA deck above, youll find the ships observation lounge, a room so dark I wonder what the decorator had in mind...a nearby bar, a very large casino, a card room, and a charming little wood-paneled library. Nestled away from all passenger spaces aft on this deck is the Starlight Room, venue for aerobics classes by day and disco by night. Dont fool yourselves, though....passengers who know about it dont go, and those who dont know about it cant...so who goes? The officers and staff, of course, attend in great droves on any given night. Add to these spaces a small and almost capable gym with a large hot tub and the tiniest of saunas is located up on Sun Deck...but there are no changing facilities nor anywhere to leave your personal possessions...like clothes...while you bake...Finally, a teen center and a pleasant childrens playroom and outdoor splash pool are available down on Aloha Deck, and a two tiered cinema is housed down in the bowels of the liner.\n\nThere are five locations, not including room service, where food is available during the day and evening.....2 dining rooms, 2 outdoor buffets, and a pizzeria. Just keep in mind that at whatever appointed hour for food service to end the comestibles are snatched away and you would have to call on room service or attend that Pizzeria for sustenance on an off hour. Located midships on Aloha Deck, just below many of the lounges, are the bright, comfortable Savoy and Regency Dining Rooms (Sitmar named dining rooms after great hotels like Londons Mayfair and Savoy) and they are almost identical in size and furnishings.\n\nJust as Mr. Vlasov did not want you sleeping together, he did NOT want you to eat alone (go figure) so there are no dedicated tables for two, but if you require one...and generally we do...we are far too altruistic to impose ourselves on strangers at mealtimes...the competent maitred or his staff will do their utmost to provide you one if space allows. Menus are varied and complete.....and if items appeared more than once it was because we were on board too long...the menus are designed not to repeat but no other SKY PRINCESS cruise is three weeks long (we added a 2 night coastal to a 19 night Alaska/transPacific/Korea/Siberia/Japan jaunt for 21 nights here)...\n\nEverything we ate in the dining room was palatable....though on quite a few afternoons only an always available cheeseburger appealed...and after two attempts at the lunch buffet...where some of the dreariest comestibles this side of a university cafeteria ply their wares...we always waited for the second sitting luncheon gong at 1:30P.M. If you are a pasta fiend...you can live on it here...there are usually four and sometimes five or six different pasta dishes daily and at both lunch and dinner, a pasta dish if not two is prepared and dished up right in the dining room. We were very pleased with the service both at our assigned table and anywhere else we found ourselves for a meal..its excellent, with friendly, efficient waiters, busboys who remember if you like your tea iced or hot, your coffee American or Italian and then there were the knowledgeable wine stewards...Despite the several wine kiosks set up to increase wine sales, the wine stewards had little to do on our sailing...and, we were told...usually sell little wine...maybe its the prices...many Princess passengers are Californians, and used to fairly decent wines for $5 to $10 per bottle at home, resent paying $18 and $20 or more for the same stuff, just because Princess is selling it to them. This is a situation we see everywhere in the cruise business...not just on Princess...and because of the captive nature of the buying audience...we shake pointing fingers at the bean counters and screamSHAME on YOU!!! But we applaud the minimum of hoopla...the lack of. singing waiters, forced applause, and the Lets Make Merry summer camp ambience, the faux cameraderie foisted upon strangers is happily missing here...So heres our take on FOOD in the dining room... meals in the dining room were relaxed, comfortable and some of the food delicious.\n\nToo bad Sitmar Cruises didnt consider the popularity of al fresco and/or buffet dining when they designed this ship because the SKY PRINCESS just does not have a proper outfitting for outdoor breakfast and lunch buffets. But that doesnt mean that this company has forsaken the hungry swimsuit crowd...and honestly, Princess has greatly improved lunch buffets...just a few years ago, they really were unspeakably bad...now theyre just...well, less than good...cold burgers, cold fries, cold special items...all of which should be warm...(in all fairness, the outside temperature rarely exceeded 60 degrees on our sailing)...but the selections sure have increased!\n\nEven had buffet food aboard the SKY PRINCESS really been first rate...with 800 or more passengers glomming free food like theres no tomorrow...theres no place for them all to sit!. Surrounding one of the two outdoor pools are two buffet lines flanking the pool aft on Promenade Deck and a myriad of folding tables groan under displays of desserts, soups, salad and some specialty items, etc., and there is enough plastic patio furniture nearby to seat one to two hundred at a time....but overflow customers tote trays to the unlikeliest spots....bar stools, benches in foyers....wherever they can find a place to park it.\n\nFrankly, with the service and food so tasty in the dining room, we just dont fathom the popularity of the buffet....can it be that some of us shyer diners are too embarrassed to ask a waiter for seconds? Anyway, if you MUST eat outside, go up to Deck 10 and grab lunch from the sandwich, soup and salad bar located at the Lido Deck pool. Rarely crowded. With tables shielded from the wind, this buffet lacked some of the hot items served two decks below but there were plenty of tasty treats....at breakfast, hot croissants, danish, cold cuts, cheeses and smoked fish were among the selections. And if you want it, or can stomach it, for it quickly gained a reputation as AWFUL, theres the pizzeria, where individual sized pies with a variety of toppings, or giant calzones are served.\n\nA look through the brochure tells you that the SKY PRINCESS accommodates you in any of 18 cabin categories, but dont believe it... there are really only 4 kinds of cabins on the SKY PRINCESS....and they are excellent cabins all! Standard inside and outside cabins have two lower beds (some feature pullman uppers to accommodate three or four people), superb drawer and closet space, bathroom with shower, TV, and the thoughtful 5 star amenity of freshly laundered bathrobes. We counted 16 drawers in the inside rooms up on Lido Deck...Because old man Vlasov who headed Sitmar was a conservative sort who felt that two people should share a big bed ONLY for the purpose of propagating the species, he VETOED any solution that would permit beds to be arranged as doubles according to occupants wants...so in this ship, beds cannot be pushed together to form a queen.\n\nOf the 16 categories of standard cabin, only location determines category...and thus price...and other than that theres not a blessed whit of difference between minimum outside category G and top dollar standard category B, except Dolphin Deck cabins have portholes and the others have windows....and the insides are like the outsides so if you dont spend any time relaxing in your cabin, and dont mind the lack of natural light, book DOWN...take an inside and by NO MEANS should you even consider paying for any higher outside grade...You will not get your moneys worth. Even if you bear in mind the old caveat of avoiding cabins too far forward or aft, there are no lousy cabin locations in this ship. If you like a lot of private time aboard ship, and frankly we do, and if decor means everything to you like it does to ONE of us, we recommend you spring for the prettiest cabins aboard...the minisuites.\n\nDrapes separate the sleeping area from the rest of the room (when drapes are closed that area becomes a real cozy cocoon of a bedroom), the siting area has a large leather sofa (convertible to bed), and a big picture window.....oh yes, theres a refrigerator too. These are great accommodations and now enjoy Princess Grand Class service. Be warned, though...these minisuites come with two big negatives...well maybe ONE...if you are bringing enough clothes for more than a 10 or 12 day trip you may find the three closets and few drawers barely adequate...we were packed for a 30 day trip and only just managed it....by the way...suitcases do NOT go under beds here...we had to stash ours in the closets but, in fairness, the steward would happily have taken them and stored them for is...I did not like the BATHROOM! Like the standard cabins bathrooms, minisuite bathrooms are SMALL....27\" from door to a counter 17\" deep...throne faces shower curtain a mere 50\" away...and the bathroom door opens IN and both of us managed to tear flesh on the tops of our feet because it does. Add to the amenities of a minisuite a bathtub in a fully marbled bathroom, a double bed, a dressing room and a balcony, and you have a category AA suite. On selected sailings, passengers housed in suites and minisuites receive Princess new Grand Class butler service....nightly canapes, express laundry, mail service, and a host of little this and thats.....its such a great concept that you really need not leave your suite EVER!!! So sublime is the experience, we reluctantly (only because we loathe dividing ships into classes) give FIVE STARS to the SKY PRINCESS IF YOU ARE TRAVELING IN A MINI SUITE OR SUITE...but for the rest, we grudgingly give her three and a half.\n\nDuring the fall, winter and spring, Princess deploys SKY PRINCESS on some really exotic itineraries in the Pacific.....Southeast Asia, Australia/New Zealand, South Seas islands, and Hawaii. Most of these cruises are about two weeks long.....but what a shame it would be to fly all the way to say, Australia, and not take a couple of extra days to relax before the cruise....so if at all possible, consider taking three weeks if you can. During the summer, SKY PRINCESS offers week long cruises between Vancouver and Anchorage or vice versa.\n\nThe SKY PRINCESS gets an upper middle class clientele for her interesting Asia cruises and they do tend to be older...Its cheaper than a nursing home and it goes places was overheard here, too, by one of the countless old codgers we passed...But dont countem out yet, the older generation has too much to offer, saw too much and did too much and know too much to let em pass by without filling you in on things you want to know...we met men who sailed the Pacific in the 1930s! And with minds sharper than many of todays college kids, any number of Princess older passengers can be great companions. When she returns to North America in spring 1998 she will do those 7 night Alaska cruises and will get a wider age, educational and economic level...\n\nWe have ONE MAJOR complaint about the SKY PRINCESS and it is the excessive in your face sales pitches for everything but the kitchen sink. Not a sea day went by where much of the lone indoor corridor on Promenade Deck, not to mention Piano Lounge and nearby lounges, wasnt clogged with giant portable tables set up with T-shirts, jewelry....you name it....all kinds of items that would be better displayed in the shops....after all, there are FOUR stores on board including the photo shop, and one of them is quite spacious.\n\nNor do we give more than little exaggeration when we tell you that every other published event in the daily program was linked with an invitation to part with your cash..OK sign for it...not just bingo (which was played TWICE a day on most sea days) or casino specials, but seminars on how to fix your face, your hair, wine tastings, art auctions, and so on. Yes, most ships have these things, dreadful as some of these activities are...but the Princess Patter (program of the day) looks more like the classifieds...and lets not forget...the whole back page IS advertising...With so much emphasis on generating on board sales, quiz times, librarys opening hours, and bridge play were pretty much the only indoor non revenue activities. It was so intense and the real activities so limited, that passengers volunteered to provide impromptu programs on foreign language and maritime history and other things.\n\nFifty years ago, passengers were counted on to contribute to the entertainment on board, but today, there is no excuse. We KNOW it costs money to build four 77,000 and one 109,000 gross ton cruise ship and of COURSE, Princess, we will help you pay for the damn things...but the Princess people REALLY need to tone down this obsession with spend, spend, spend and beef up their offerings of lectures, movies and other things...Several passengers with whom we spoke..a couple of doctors wives, a retired banker, some ex-military men, told us they were actually angered by the extent of Princess sales come-ons and sales tables that were so blatant...they all agreed that they did not take the cruise to be hustled..and like us, those people felt their intelligence had been insulted. In spite of this, co-author Chris Smith loves this ship...and if he doesnt like a scheduled activity, he wont go to it...and he frankly cant remember ANY activity other than meals he ever went to!!!...But he loves this ships decks, their layout, the sizes and locations of the public rooms, and Smith can usually tune out irritating dance combos...though he DID NOT like it when the shop took over the Promenade Deck Lounge, and found the no-smoking policy a bit TOO extensive...so he felt unwelcome in the Piano Lounge, but found somewhere else to go at all times...usually right up to our minisuite!"
