        "text": "The parent of Princess Cruises said today that it had agreed to buy privately held Sitmar Cruises for $210 million in cash and an unspecified amount of debt, a merger that would create the nation's second-largest cruise company behind Carnival Cruise Lines.\n\nTravel industry executives and experts said the merger between rival Los Angeles-based cruise companies was part of a consolidation trend in the $5 billion-a-year cruise ship industry. The industry is growing at 10 percent a year and is aiming at a broader market, where competition is keener and larger cruise operations are more cost-effective.\n\nUnder terms of the proposed deal, the Peninsular and Oriental Steam Navigation Company of Britain will pay Sitmar's owners $210 million and assume the line's debt, which includes loans on three new $150 million ships. Sitmar Cruises is principally owned by the Vlasov family trust.\n\nThe combined companies are to operate under the Princess banner. The two cruise companies have catered to an older audience touring the Caribbean. Princess, with five ships, also goes to Israel, while the four-ship Sitmar line cruises to Australia and New Zealand."
