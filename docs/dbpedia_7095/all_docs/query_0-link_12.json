        "text": "A Cruise Company Reflecting Generations Of Maritime And Travel Experience\n\nIn the early 1990s, the Lefebvre family of Rome, former owners of Sitmar Cruises, conceived and organized a unique cruise company pledging to build and operate the highest quality ships in the ultra-luxury segment. John Bland, former president of Sitmar and one of the industry's most respected executives, was appointed as Silversea's founding president. Bland worked with a small but select group of professionals crafting what was to become one of the world's preeminent cruise lines. The name \"Silversea\" was chosen because it connotes quality and luxury as well as capturing the romance and special sensations of the sea.\n\nSilversea's ships were designed to incorporate the very best elements of the world's favorite cruise ships: an open, single seating dining room; an elaborate show lounge for nightly entertainment-an element missing on other small luxury ships; an Italian crew and European staff; exquisite decor; superb service and cuisine; and luxurious all suite accommodations, 75 percent featuring private verandas. At 16,800 grt, these exceptional ships would accommodate a mere 296 guests providing one of the highest passenger space ratios (56.75) of any ship at sea.\n\nSister ships Silver Cloud and Silver Wind would be wrapped-up in one truly all-inclusive price featuring: all suite accommodations; roundtrip economy air transportation; deluxe pre-cruise hotel stay; all gratuities; all beverages, including select wines and spirits; all port charges; all transfers and porterage; and The Silversea Experience, a complimentary shore event offered on select sailings.\n\nWhen industry skeptics said an all-inclusive luxury product could never succeed, or when competitors said there wasn't any room in the luxury market for another cruise line, Bland and his team would simply respond: \"We'll let the market decide.\"\n\nFollowing two years of planning and preparation, Silver Cloud debuted in April 1994, followed by Silver Wind in February 1995. Each ship received rave reviews from travel agents, press, and most importantly, the guests. It appeared to all that a star was born.\n\nWith the product philosophy firmly in place, it became time to look at the future management and growth of the company. In March 1995, Bill Smith joined Silversea as Senior Vice President of Sales and Marketing. In November of that same year, Smith, a protÈgÈ of Bland since the days of Sitmar (arguably one of the most popular cruise lines of all time), was tapped as Silversea's President and Chief Operating Officer. His mission: to consolidate the worldwide functions of Silversea, maintain and even exceed its excellent service standards, and guide the company into a successful and profitable future.\n\nDuring his first two years as President, Smith made final appointments to his management team (see attached roster) and guided the company on a successful course as it grew from about 25 employees to its current roster of more than 100 in the Ft. Lauderdale headquarters, and an office in London that handles sales and marketing in the UK and Europe. Silversea also has a worldwide network of General Sales Agents (GSAs) representing the company internationally.\n\nWhen Silversea began promoting cruises in 1993 for its inaugural cruise in April 1994, only the Sales and Marketing division was based in Ft. Lauderdale. Under Smith's direction, the line consolidated all of its functions in the corporate office in Ft. Lauderdale: Finance and Hotel departments relocated from Monaco in Spring of 1995; Reservations came in-house in September 1995 (formerly handled by Certified Vacations); and finally, in April 1997, all Vessel/Marine Operations relocated to Ft. Lauderdale as well.\n\nWith the creation of the Vessel Operations Division all marine, deck and engine, manning, and hotel operations are now managed from Ft. Lauderdale. As a result of this expansion, Silversea no longer required the services of V. Ships of Monaco. In only its second full year of operation (1996), Silversea's ultra-luxury sister ships Silver Cloud and Silver Wind sailed at near capacity often exceeding an 85 percent load factor and the line ended 1997 with equally impressive results.\n\nThe readers of Conde Nast Traveler magazine echoed the sentiments of the agent community when they voted Silversea \"World's Best Cruise Line\" in 1996. Never before in the nine year history of the Readers' Choice Awards has a cruise line received as high a rating (93.7) and topped the list of 100 best travel companies in the world. And this was only the first year of Silversea's eligibility.\n\nThe list of accolades continues to grow: Silversea was again voted \"World's Best\" by the readers of Conde Nast Traveler in 1997 and again in 1998; and, the readers of Travel & Leisure consider Silversea to be the very best small ship cruise line as well (1997 and 1998). The line's exceptional product has consistently garnered the highest possible accolades from leading guide books including: Six Stars, Fielding's Guide to Worldwide Cruises (1996, 1997, 1998, 1999); Five-plus Ribbons, Stern's Cruise Guide (1997, 1998); Six Stars, Access Cruise Guide (1997-debut year); \"Number One Cruise Line\" and \"Number One Cruise Ship Cuisine\", America Online (1997); and \"Best of the Best\" Suites, Travel Holiday (1995).\n\nNot one to rest on its laurels, Silversea is always searching for new and innovative ways to develop and perfect its product. Strategic marketing alliances with prominent world names such as Relais & Chateaux - Relais Gourmands and National Geographic provide an enrichment aspect to Silversea cruises not found on other lines. In 1997, the very first designer jewelry boutique at sea debuted aboard Silver Cloud and aboard Silver Wind in 1998, to date, sales in the Bvlgari shop have exceeded expectations. And in 1998, the line's \"Silver Links\" golf program and fly-fishing cruises will debut. All said, it provides a nice balance of culture, cuisine, history, fashion and activity.\n\nThey say imitation is the best form of flattery and in mid-1997 some of Silversea's competitors began including complimentary beverages in their cruise product. It is well understood that clientele at this end of the market can afford the fine wines and beverages that have always been offered complimentary on Silversea. Cost to the guest wasn't the concern when it was decided this would be part of Silversea's all-inclusive product. Rather, a sociable and friendly atmosphere was the goal. It obviously worked as Silversea has always been described as a friendly ship with a relaxed, casual elegance.\n\nSilversea's product concept and delivery is validated by its guests. After just three years of both ships in full operation, the line boasts a repeat guest rate over 35 percent. And membership in its Venetian Society (repeat guest program) is growing steadily. Travel agents and guests alike appreciate Silversea's no-discounting business philosophy and all-inclusive product delivery. And they love the verandas, too!\n\nSilversea is bullish on the future of the ultra-luxury market, and is expanding its fleet with the addition of two slightly larger vessels that will be of similar design and style as Silver Cloud and Silver Wind.\n\nToday, Silversea Cruises has set a new cruise industry standard in the ultra-luxury market by bridging the gap between ocean-liner and small-ship cruising. The line is distinguished by its all-suite ships, all-inclusive pricing, imaginative global itineraries and genuine hospitality. As the line prepares for the future, it is quite clear that the market has decided: Silversea is an undisputed success."
