        "text": "The Fleets\n\nSocietà Italiana Trasporti Marittimi (SITMAR) 1937-1988\n\nThe Società Italiana Trasporti Marittimi (SITMAR) was formed by Russian émigré Alexandre Vlasov. Vlasov operated cargo ships under various flags (including Greek, Italian and British) before and during the war. After the war, numerous American wartime standard ships were available for purchase, and Vlasov bought the Wooster Victory and Vassar Victory. These were suitable for emigrant carriers since both had been troopships in the war. He chartered them to the IRO (International Refugee Organisation [run by the UN]). The Vassar Victory was renamed CASTELBIANCO, under the Italian flag, whereas Wooster Victory initially operated under her original name, before becoming the CASTELVERDE when she also became Italian flagged.\n\nBy 1952, the IRO charters were coming to an end, and CASTEL BIANCO and CASTEL VERDE (as their names were later spelled), were put into service as emigrant carriers between Genoa and Central America. Before starting this service, both ships were substantially rebuilt. Sitmar withdrew the Central American service in 1957, and the two ships were sold to the Spanish Line.\n\nVlasov also bought an American C3 ship in 1949, and was rebuilt as the 1,800 passenger FAIRSEA (1). She was Panamanian-flagged. Also a former German seaplane tender the Friesenland was purchased from the British Government and converted into a refrigerated ship with limited passenger accommodation and named FAIRSKY (1).\n\nIn 1950 another American C ship was purchased but the rebuilding into a reefer ship was halted and she was laid up. In 1958-1959 she was rebuilt into a passenger ship and renamed FAIRSKY (2).\n\nFAIRSEA (1) initially operated IRO charters, and was then put on the Australian run. She also made a few North Atlantic crossings. In 1953 between Bremen and Quebec, FAIRSEA (1) was given a long-term contract by Australia to carry emigrants from Southampton. The other C3 ship became the FAIRSKY (2) in 1958, under the Panamanian flag, and also joining the Australian service.\n\nAlso joining the Australian service was the CASTEL FELICE, purchased in 1952 originally the BI Line's Kenya. The CASTEL FELICE also made several round voyages between Bremen and Quebec and Le Havre-Southampton and New York but was mainly sailing between south Europe and Australia.\n\nAlexandre Vlasov died in 1961 and his son Boris became director of the company.\n\nThe FAIRSTAR previously the Bibby Line troopship Oxfordshire was purchased in 1964. These four ships maintained the emigrant service until 1970, when the contract passed to Chandris Lines. An attempt to regain the Australian contract was made when Vlasov acquired the Cunarders Carinthia and Sylvania in 1968. The plans came to nothing, and they remained laid up at Southampton for a number of years as the FAIRLAND and FAIRWIND. The loss of their regular contracts forced Sitmar to change direction, and they devoted their activities towards becoming a major cruise company. FAIRSEA (1) had already been scrapped in 1969, following a fire in the engine room, and CASTEL FELICE was scrapped in 1970 at the end of the Australian contract. The ex-Cunarders FAIRLAND and FAIRWIND received substantial conversions into cruise ships. FAIRLAND was renamed FAIRSEA (2) before entering service in 1971. The two ships joined the FAIRSKY (2) and FAIRSTAR for cruising on the American market.\n\nThe FAIRSKY (2) was sold for scrap in 1977. A third large ship was sought to replace her, initial interest in the Queen Anna Maria being thwarted when she was bought by Carnival. Finally, the Portuguese liner Principe Perfeito was bought to replace her in 1979, being renamed FAIRSKY (3). She was due to be converted in a Spanish yard, for completion in 1981, but it was eventually decided that the project was uneconomic, and she was sold to John Latsis in 1982. In her place a new FAIRSKY (4) was delivered in 1984 as a cruise ship.\n\nThe SITMAR FAIRMAJESTY was the last passenger ship built for cruising ordered by Sitmar before the take over by P&O and never sailed for Sitmar.\n\nIn 1988 Boris Vlasov put Sitmar Cruises as the passengers department was called now for sale and the company was sold to P&O. P&O assigned all SITMAR’s ships to Princess Cruises except for the FAIRSTAR which had a separate management office in Sydney.\n\nsee also http://www.ssmaritime.com/sitmar2.htm\n\nMany thanks to Henk Jungerius and Ted Finch for their assistance in collecting this data.
