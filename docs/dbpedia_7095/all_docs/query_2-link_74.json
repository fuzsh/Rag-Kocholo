        "text": "From LA to Mexico – Princess Cruises celebrates 50th anniversary – PRINCESS CRUISES celebrates its 50th anniversary this week with a trip down memory lane for passengers.\n\nTo cap a year of 50th anniversary activities, Princess Cruises, which celebrates the five decade mark in 2015, created a special Mexico itinerary sailing today, December 3, 2015.\n\nThis is exactly 50 years to the day that the line’s original ship, Princess Patricia, set sail on the company’s very first cruise in 1965.\n\nPrincess Patricia sailing to Mexico – 50 years ago today…\n\nOffered on the intimate Pacific Princess, the unique sailing is the same length as the company’s first cruise – 14 days – and will include a blend of ports from the maiden itinerary such as Puerto Vallarta, Mazatlán and Manzanillo, with some newer destinations such as La Paz and Loreto.\n\nHistory of Princess Cruises…\n\nGuests on the cruise will be treated to an array of activities and entertainment commemorating half a century of cruising by the famous line, and will also be joined by some surprise guests.\n\n“This nostalgic cruise to Mexico will be the perfect finale to what’s sure to be a special 50th anniversary year for Princess,” said Jan Swartz, Princess Cruises president. “For this significant milestone we couldn’t resist recreating, with some new touches, the very first cruise our company operated. And because the name Pacific Princess is so integral to our company’s history, we wanted to offer the cruise aboard the current ship with this iconic name.”\n\nOne of the best-known names in cruising, Princess Cruises first set sail in 1965 with a single ship cruising to Mexico. Nearly 50 years later, the line has grown to become the third largest cruise line in the world and a recognized leader in taking travelers to some of the most fascinating places around the globe.\n\nHISTORY OF PRINCESS CRUISES and THE LOVE BOAT…\n\nFor those not old enough to recall the ABC-TV series, “The Love Boat” debuted in 1977 and lasted until 1986.\n\nThe series showcased cruising to the mass market.\n\nIt is safe to say that ‘The Love Boat” single handedly introduced the concept of vacation cruising to the masses and was responsible for over a billion dollars in revenue for passenger travel by ship.\n\nIt could be called the greatest dramatic info-commercial of all time.\n\nFor two seasons Princess Patricia was chartered to Stan McDonald, a Canadian-born businessman now in Seattle, for cruising between Los Angeles and Acapulco during the winter.McDonald became excited about cruising during the 1962 Seattle World’s Fair.\n\nHe eventually branched out to other vessels but chose to name his new company Princess Cruises after the venerable Princess Patricia.History of the S.S. Princess Patricia and the legacy of naming the “Love Boat” ships of Princess Cruises.\n\nIt all started with the Canadian Pacific Railway’s costal liners…\n\nThe Canadian Princess Railway formed the British Columbia Coast Steamship Service (BCCSS), which would provide passenger service to various coastal communities for the next 80 years.\n\nMany of its special breeds of coastal ships bore the name “Princess”.\n\nThe CPR celebrated 100 years of service in 1981, the same year in which its last remaining cruise ship, the SS Princess Patricia (the original Princess Cruise Line’s Love Boat) was tied up, ending that phase of transportation service in the Pacific Northwest.\n\nA painting by Michael L. Grace of the first “Love Boat” and original cruise ship of Princess Cruises – the PRINCESS PATRICIA. The ship is seen sailing under the Vincent Thomas Bridge in San Pedro – for her first (Princess) cruise to Mexico.\n\nThe Princess Patricia under steam. How she would have appeared when making her first Princess Line Cruises.\n\nThe early CPNC ship Islander set the precedent for the Princess ships that would become the backbone of the eventual CPR fleet servicing the BC coast and Alaska.\n\nWhen built, she was the most luxurious vessel on the west coast.\n\nShe began cruising to Alaska in 1889, when the arrival of a steamer as elegant as Islander was a big event.\n\nHer career ended suddenly when carrying gold and passengers south from Skagway on July 13, 1892.\n\nThe ship sank after hitting a submerged rock or drifting iceberg; 42 perished.\n\nThe “Princess” title came to be used for CPR ships because of the aging CPNC vessel Princess Louise.\n\nThe popular “Empress” ships were already established in the Pacific, so the decision was made to carry out a royal theme, with smaller coastal ships bearing the prefix “Princess”.\n\nPrincess Victoria was the first purpose-built ship for the BCCSS, and immediately set the standards for luxury liners on the coast.\n\nBoth the appearance of her hull and superstructure as well as interior arrangement would be copied for many subsequent Princess ships.\n\nThe smaller Princess Beatrice was the first CPR Princess built in British Columbia.\n\nBy 1907, Princess May and the new Princess Royal began regular 6-day sailings to Skagway.\n\nA year later, the CPR inaugurated its famous Triangle Route, with service between Seattle, Vancouver and Victoria. Princess Charlotte joined the fleet, handling the Triangle Route as well as occasional excursions to Alaska.\n\nFrom 1910-1911, four more Princesses (Princess Mary, Princess Adelaide, Princess Alice and Princess Sophia) were built and a newly purchased ship was renamed Princess Patricia.\n\nIn 1913, Princess Maquinna joined the fleet.\n\nWorld War I expropriated two new Princess ships for the war effort; neither ship ever joined the CPR fleet.\n\nAfter the war, shipyard space in Europe was fully booked so the CPR had Princess Louise built in British Columbia.\n\nShe was very well appointed, and could boast that all 133 first class staterooms had both hot and cold running water. In 1922, she began a 40-year career running to Alaska, earning her nickname “Queen of the Northern Seas”.\n\nAs the years passed, the CRP continued to add to its fleet and its routes, replacing old ships with new.\n\nPrincess Patricia in Acapulco, Mexico on her first Princess Cruise.\n\nPrincess Patricia docked in Ensenada, Mexico. During the first year of Princess Cruises – the company operated short cruises to Ensenada.\n\nAriel view of the Princess Patricia. On her way to Alaska.\n\nDuring the 1920s, cruising to Alaska was very profitable, with three Princess ships making the voyage in the summer months.\n\nOccupancy was regularly 97 percent and during one season the three ships handled 10,000 passengers on 22 voyages. Revenues dwindled during the Great Depression, and the BCCSS disposed of old or redundant vessels. World War II saw several Princess ships requisitioned for use as troop transports and supply ships.\n\nAfter the war, Princess Kathleen was rebuilt for the Alaska Service.\n\nTwo new sister ships were built for the Triangle Run, Princess Marguerite and Princess Patricia, named for earlier CPR ships. In 1952, Princess Kathleen ran onto rocks in Lynn Canal.\n\nFortunately, there was no loss of life but the ship sank. For the next 10 years, Princess Louise handled CPR’s Alaska cruises alone. The arrival of car ferries spelled the end of coastal service and the CPR ended its regular Triangle Run.\n\nPrincess Marguerite stayed on a daily summer route to Seattle, while a refurbished Princess Patricia took over the Vancouver-Skagway-Juneau run in 1963.\n\nFor two seasons Princess Patricia was chartered to Stan McDonald, a Canadian-born businessman now in Seattle, for cruising between Los Angeles and Acapulco during the winter. McDonald became excited about cruising during the 1962 Seattle World’s Fair. He eventually branched out to other vessels but chose to name his new company Princess Cruises after the venerable Princess Patricia.\n\nPrincess Patricia docked in Vancouver, BC, Canada. These were the original colors during the period Stanley McDonald charted the night boat from CPR. The two stacks were later changed to the red colors seen in the photos above.\n\nThe Princess Patricia became the last remaining passenger ship in the CPR fleet, continuing to sail to Alaska each summer until that era ended on October 12, 1981. Her legacy lived on with the many ships of Princess Cruise Lines.\n\nThe History of Princess Cruises: A Timeline of Key Events\n\n1965\n\n• Company founder Stanley B.
