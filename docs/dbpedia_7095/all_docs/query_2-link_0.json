        "text": "Let's go back in time..... Your Sitmar Experience !\n\nMy grandma was a frequent cruise traveler & always had brochures on her coffee table. Of all her cruises she couldn't stop talking about Sitmar. How Italian it was, the food, the Fairwind, the service. She had many Princess & Royal Viking line brochures also.\n\nWhen most boys my age were dreaming of Star Wars in 1978, I was obsessed with cruise ships....specifically the Fairwind ! I made a promise to myself that as soon as I became an adult with some disposable income that I'd run, not walk to our local travel agency.\n\nFast forward to 1988 when I did run to the travel agency & the friendly woman told me that Sitmar was just that week bought out by Princess . I couldn't believe it. When I finally set sail, Fairwind was officially Dawn Princess. The sea witch looked beautiful on her funnel & gone was the famous Sitmar yellow. Back then a 25,000 grt ship seemed big !\n\nThe mostly older crew seemed tired & going through the motions, particularly in the dining room. I found this surprising considering the reputation of Sitmar, but a table mate said that the general changes after Princess were notable. Much of the food & desserts were prepared on carts at the table & full platters of vegetables were individually served. My cabin steward was near my age, Portuguese, very warm & friendly.\n\nWe talked in Spanish. Dawn Princess was obviously an older ship that had seen younger, fresher days. The cosmetic upkeep didn't seem to be a priority for Princess. I still loved the ship nonetheless.\n\nOn this cruise I discovered two places that I still gravitate to aboard any ship - promenade deck & aft pool . I'll never forget swimming in that aft pool in a tropical sunset & hearing the dinner chimes & announcement in Italian calling first seating to the dining room.\n\nWe were spoiled by our 2nd cruise which was on Sitmar's Fairwind in summer 1988. The white glove service from silver serving platters by Italian & Portuguese waiters was amazing. Their pizzeria in red & white had freshly baked calzones & pizzas which were great. It was an all Italian & Portuguese and our waiter was pictured on that final Sitmar brochure and Paolo was great!\n\nSix months later we sailed the now Dawn Princess & definitely noticed changes...all of those great things were gone & the overall cruise experience definitely was degraded. :( Two years later we tried Costa's Cruising Italian Style which was closer to Sitmar than Princess but overall we preferred Princess.\n\nWhile I don't know if Princess offered a nightly pasta course before the merger, thankfully Princess still has this option even though it's no longer freshly made onboard the ship. I occasionally run into one of the old Sitmar Italian or Portuguese crewmembers & enjoy reminiscing with them. A few continued their careers with Princess because of their love of the sea.\n\nHowever the price we paid was about the same as now nearly 30 years later. With inflation we paid much more & today such prices would be closer to those on luxury or more premium cruise lines such as Oceania & Azamara. I've never sailed on those premium cruise lines because of their price however good friends who've sailed Oceania, Azamara & Princess say they're a step up from Princess. Although to get Sitmar's level of service & food we'd probably have to sail a luxury cruise line which definitely isn't within our budget.\n\nAnd with Princess we can afford to sail more days & to still enjoy our cruise experience. Even though it'll never be Sitmar it also doesn't have Sitmar's higher prices. It's enjoyable to have a trip down memory lane however the good old days of cruising were rarely affordable for many of us to take a cruise.\n\nLobez...I still have my cruise log book & it was the Circolo del Comandante which is translated to the Captain's Circle. Do you remember the list each cabin received with the roster of passengers & their hometowns? I discovered at the end of the cruise their were other passengers from our small town.\n\nEdited March 21, 2017 by Astro Flyer\n\nIn February 1985, we took the Fairsea from Aruba through the Panama Canal to Los Angeles. As everyone else has stated, the food, the crew, and the service were exceptional.\n\nWe had our 17 month old daughter with us. At the time, not many children would be on board (there were six under the age of ten on our sailing).\n\nSitmar had a complimentary children's program for six months old and up (there were cribs and diapers in a separate nursery area of the children's area).\n\nThe staff were not Sitmar employees but were instead volunteers that did a round trip (LA-LA) for free in exchange for working in the children's area a certain amount of time. And the qualifications to be eligible to volunteer were stringent. Sitmar only accepted people that had professional experience with children, i.e; nurses, EMTs, teachers, etc. On our cruise the volunteer staff consisted of one teacher, two pediatric nurses, an EMT and a child social worker,\n\nBesides the usual fun and games, the teacher had a daily two hour \"class\" time in which she was available to help with school work.\n\nThe highlight was the cookies and milk \"tea\" party that the captain and his wife hosted in their quarters for the children (parents were welcomed to attend).\n\nAt the time ship's would not have a buffet area. In the morning, there would be a light breakfast (scrambled eggs, bacon, toast, pastries, cereal, fruit) set up on the rear of the promenade deck.\n\nBecause our daughter had learned the first day that all the action was on the upper decks, she would be awake and ready to go around 6:30 AM each morning. We would go up to have breakfast on deck. On the third morning, as we approached the serving table, a ship's officer was standing there.\n\nWe didn't realize he was waiting for us until he approached and said he had a big favor to ask of us. The ship crew had families and many missed their children. Would we please allow our daughter to be taken to the crew mess for breakfast?\n\nWhen we said yes, he arranged to meet us back at the serving table in one hour.\n\nEvery morning after that, a ship's officer was there for the \"baby,\" and in one hour an officer (including the captain one day) would carry her back up to us. She usually had jelly smeared on her mouth and she would be clutching some goody a crew member had given her. We would be given a full report by the returning officer on what she had eaten and drank at breakfast (and it was always nourishing food, the goody clutched in her hand was just the good bye treat each morning).\n\nIt seemed that every crew member on the ship knew Alicia (our daughter) and always stopped to talk and play with her as we passed. This included the crew that usually did not interact with passengers such as the deck washers, the mechanics, and others. This would happen in the presence of a \"boss,\" who would just smile as the crew stopped to play with the baby.\n\nThe last day, when we were leaving, there were tears in the eyes of the crew who said good bye to her as we passed to leave. We had also received a handwritten note from the captain the night before thanking us for sharing our baby with the crew and telling us we would never know what a difference her presence had made on board ship.\n\nYes, those were good times. The kids could do no wrong. My DD would disappear and when I'd notice there she was doing dolly racing. Dolly and suitcase and dolly and Kim. I told her to leave them alone so they could work. Umm, no. Back on and the races were on. Every night this drop dead gorgeous young Italian would see my daughter enter the dining room. He would stop what he was doing and run over, put her arm through his and escort her to the table. She was 7. Our cabin held 4. Two sets of bunk beds and a single night stand. We actually had an outside cabin. You walked down a narrow hallway and looked out the tiny port hole. The midnight buffet was a King's spread.\n\nOne night the Captain was doing a speech. I told her to leave the cruise director alone that he was working. As the Captain finishes up and walks toward the back of the room for the photo op he grabbed my daughter and took her with him pulling her to his side. Came time for the first dance, she was it. He handed her off to the CD and then on to the other officers. My DD could fold napkins with the best of them.\n\nEvery time I watch the Love Boat I laugh. About the only real thing on that ship is the staircase. The pool is the about the right size but you certainly couldn't dive in it. I mean Julie and staff had a cabin that was twice the size of the real M'D's cabin. His was really the size of the waiters except instead of 4 there was just him and he got his own bathroom. Back then, the morning was spent doing the place settings for dinner.\n\nFast forward many years later. She is an 18 YO. We see one of our friend waiters. One that we had known since she was 7. Yes, people we were friends. Every time the ship docked in Vancouver we met up with him. Sometimes shopping, sometimes our house. Anyway, he was laughing about her \"boots\" that she wore for Air Cadets (the US version of ROTC). The guy with him laughs. You could hear a pin drop. He looks at the other guy and says, YOU have no right commenting on her shoes. I've known her since she was a child."
