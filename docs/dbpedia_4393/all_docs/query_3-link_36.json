        "text": "Shades come in many shapes and sizes, but typically they are in adult human sizes. They are made through their queen and are typically impossible to make artificially.\n\nAppearance[]\n\nShades, by default, appear as an apparition of dark floating mass of thick black fog, which blocks light extremely well. Their body type and shape differ based upon what they decide to be, and the flames that take the place of their eyes change color based upon their power and their role.\n\nShades[]\n\nSee also the associated category: Shades\n\nKnown Kings Known Queens Known Lilly Hydatilis Logan Mintar Yulia Daryl\n\nBiology[]\n\nShades have an entirely unique biology as their bodies are completely made out of condensed smoky darkness. They are created from a Shade Queen's will and spirit energy creating new entities out of darkness within the Shade Realm. While it is possible for Shades to be born outside of the Shade realm, it is highly unheard of and extremely difficult as there is oft insufficient darkness to create new shades.\n\nOverall Abilities[]\n\nAll Shades possess the abilities to manipulate darkness as well as the dark matter that make up their bodies. The Kings have significant powers in comparison to his underlings and uses it in such to empower all who serve under him, whilst a Queen is the sole entity among the shades capable of creating permanent new life amongst the ranks of shades by herself. All shades are capable of making temporal clones of themselves due to their very nature, but the clones do not have a permanent lifespan until the body is either inhabited by a soul of the Queen's creation, or a soul is placed unto the clone by another's digression.\n\nHistory[]\n\nTBA\n\nPast[]\n\nTBA\n\nInterspecies Relationships[]\n\nDue to the Shades' unique biology, they are capable of procreating with other species. The offspring of such a relationship is called a Shadeling Hybrid. Shadelings are incapable of manipulating their bodies, but maintain the abilities afforded to them by their Shade parent and whichever powers are passed along from their non-shade parent. If a shadeling does not breed with another shadeling or a shade, their shade traits are completely removed from their genes, thus rendering their offspring to the genes passed down from their non-Shade parent.\n\nCulture[]\n\nWhilst shade culture does differ from kingdom to kingdom, all of the kingdoms do follow old medieval hierarchy and culture.\n\nTrivia[]\n\nShades are the oldest species created by Logan and are his most developed species.\n\nEvery Yin needs a Yang. As such, the contrasting species with the Shade is the Shimmer"
