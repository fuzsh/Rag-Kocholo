        "text": "I had already put together one daily round-up of new metal for this Saturday (here), but since doing that I found more items I want to share, because sharing is caring (I spit up in my mouth as I wrote that, so it didn‚Äôt turn out as funny as I‚Äôd hoped). Part of what‚Äôs in here involves clean singing; and no, we aren‚Äôt entirely bigoted on the subject despite the site‚Äôs name. However, I‚Äôm sandwiching the clean in between slices of the unclean, just so no one gets the idea that the exceptions have become the rule around here.\n\nTHE GREAT OLD ONES\n\nThe Great Old Ones are a French black metal band who released their debut album Al Azif last year via Les Acteurs de l‚ÄôOmbre Productions. To commemorate the one-year anniversary of that album, The Great Old Ones decided to record a cover of a Bj√∂rk song. Probably wouldn‚Äôt have been my pick for a celebratory commemorative, but what the fuck, I decided to check it out ‚Äî and it‚Äôs outstanding.\n\nThe band have preserved the song‚Äôs melancholy melody through a mix of vibrating tremolo chords and intensified its emotional power and dramatic punch with wrenching black metal vocals, heavy bass, and well-timed drum blasting. In retrospect, I can see how the song‚Äôs lyrics would lend themselves to a black metal cover: ‚ÄúI‚Äôm a fountain of blood . . . I‚Äôm a path of cinders burning under your feet . . . You‚Äôre the intruder hand / I‚Äôm the branch that you break.‚Äù\n\nThe Great Old Ones cover is a ‚Äúname your price‚Äù download at Bandcamp here. Have a listen below.\n\nhttp://www.facebook.com/thegreatoldones\n\nhttps://tgoo.bigcartel.com\n\nI should confess that I‚Äôd never seen Bj√∂rk‚Äôs video for ‚ÄúBachelorette‚Äù, so I took this opportunity to watch it. It‚Äôs kinda cool. However, I prefer The Great Old Ones‚Äô version of the song. üôÇ\n\nANTTI RAILIO\n\nFurther proof, as if any were needed, that Finland is one of the most metal nations on Earth, at least on a per capita basis: A Finnish metal vocalist ‚Äî Antti Railio ‚Äî won The Voice of Finland competition on April 26.\n\nYou may have heard of The Voice. It‚Äôs one of those musical TV competitions like Idol and The X Factor. It started in Holland in 2010 and spread around the world like a virus. I watched one episode of the US version this year (don‚Äôt ask why, I was probably drunk) and I couldn‚Äôt make it to the end due to a bout of projectile vomiting (by me ‚Äî if projectile vomiting had happened on the show I would have continued watching). The Finnish version had its second season this year, and I found out about Antti Railio‚Äôs triumph via our friend and close observer of Finnish metal fireangel (of the Night Elves blog).\n\nAntti Railio was formerly the frontman of a power metal band named Celesty and now has a band called The Wildfire, who seem to play a mix of hard rock and metal, based on the songs I found here. I‚Äôm embedding two videos of his performances on The Voice of Finland below. One is a cover of ‚ÄúSkyfall‚Äù and the other is a cover of the more up-tempo ‚ÄúManiac‚Äù; he brings a power metal feel to both of them (more videos of his competition performances are available on YouTube). I‚Äôm not a big power metal fan, but Antti Railio has definitely got some pipes. Congrats to him on this victory.\n\nSHADE EMPIRE\n\nTo wrap up this trio of items, I‚Äôm staying with Finland but moving back to unclean territory with Shade Empire. Their 74-minute-long fourth album Omega Arcane will be released by Candlelight Records on May 3 in Finland, on May 6 in the rest of Europe, and sometime in June in North America. In late March I spied their official video for the album‚Äôs first single, ‚ÄúRuins‚Äù, and was really impressed (featured here). The song is scathing, sweeping, and soaring, a riveting mixture of styles that include elements of black metal, melodic death metal, and doom, with orchestral touches that enhance the drama rather than clog the arteries with cheese. I thought fans of bands such as Insomnium and In Mourning would do well to pay attention. The video is a badass feast for the eyes, too.\n\nThis morning, my NCS comrade TheMadIsraeli tipped me to the fact that Omega Arcane is now streaming in full at the Finnish INFERNO web site, along with a track-by-track commentary. I haven‚Äôt yet listened to all of the album, having paused long enough to stitch this post together, but so far it‚Äôs sounding every bit as strong as ‚ÄúRuins‚Äù led me to believe it would. Listen below and pre-order here."
