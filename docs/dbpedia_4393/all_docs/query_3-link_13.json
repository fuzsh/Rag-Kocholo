Adam & Eve\n\nBlack as the heart of Satan\n\nDeep as the pits of Hell\n\nI float in infinity\n\nEach moment I die and then I'm born again\n\nTime has no meaning\n\nThere is no place\n\nThere's only Oneself and the Blackflame\n\nChaos surrounding me, the inner peace\n\nThe awareness that the work has now been completed for this part of the path\n\nWill the others follow, I do not care\n\nThe ultimate goal is still closer\n\nand someone will take the next step for me\n\nStill I'm here, but not in the form of flesh\n\nI guide you, I'm the sixth sense\n\nThe union of both, sun and the moon\n\nI'm in every flame, I'm in every shade\n\nUnion of both the sun and the moon\n\nStill I am here, but not in the form of flesh\n\nYou feel me, you hear me, but you cannot see me\n\nI am every flame, I am every shade\n\nI'm behind your every word\n\nI'm in the eyes of murderer\n\nI am Adam I am Eve, I'm the serpent and the king\n\nSon of fire and shadow\n\nI am Adam I am Eve, I'm the serpent and the king\n\nI am in every flame, I am in every shade\n\nThe union of both sun and the moon\n\nStill I am here, but not in the form of flesh\n\nI am in every flame, I am in every shade\n\nThe union of both sun and the moon\n\nStill I'm here, but not in the form of flesh\n\n3. Blood Colours The White\n\nHanging on a cliff\n\nGroping for something I cannot quite reach\n\nThe fall is too deep\n\nIf I let go It will take all that's left of me\n\nBlood colours the white\n\nI'm mesmerised\n\nIt burns in my eyes\n\nBut if I look away I lose all that I have\n\nMy mind is turning black, it's burning\n\nFaces from the dark turning\n\nThrough the scorched fields I am walking\n\nTowards the gates\n\nWho tells the truth?\n\nI see faces but\n\nthe words they speak are unknown to me\n\nThe crooked serpent\n\nThe distance is too wide\n\nHow can I know what's happening on the other side\n\nI want to let go\n\nBut then there's no turning back\n\nI'm kept in the dark\n\nI stand on my grave\n\nNo one is there\n\nThere's no name on the stone\n\nSerpent around my neck...\n\nThe gates are still sealed\n\nMy mind is turning black, it's burning\n\nFaces from the dark turning\n\nThrough the scorched fields I'm walking\n\nTowards the gates\n\nI have the key, but it's under my skin\n\nBlood colours the white\n\n4. Flesh Relinquished\n\nI slay my wings and change into serpent skin\n\nReform my flesh and hide my face from the sun\n\nThe black flames inside devour everything\n\nI rise from within and claim dominion\n\nThrough the 9 gates, through the pits of mind\n\nBurn the fields of your old life\n\nPeel off pity and remorse\n\nHeart of chaos brings tranquillity\n\nAs it starts to burn\n\nThe power within thee\n\nBrings forth thy hidden face\n\nYou will be crushed\n\nAs I claim the throne in your temple\n\nAngels are gone, your palaces burn\n\nYou enjoy the rush\n\nYour mind goes blank and you throw yourself\n\ninto the vortex of decadence\n\nAs it starts to burn\n\nThe power within thee\n\nBrings forth thy hidden face\n\nI call forth the shadow which I am\n\nand always have been\n\nWalk through the fire eternal\n\nThe flames no longer burn your flesh\n\nI slay my wings and change into serpent skin\n\nReform my flesh and hide my face from the sun\n\nThe black flames inside devour everything\n\nI rise from within and claim dominion\n\nThrough the 9 gates, through the pits of mind\n\nBurn the fields of your old life\n\nWalk through the fire eternal\n\nThe flames no longer burn your flesh\n\nYou become one of them\n\nFrom the heart of chaos you'll find tranquillity\n\n5. Harvesters Of Death\n\nHumanity carries the knowledge of the beast\n\nThe living cannot teach the dead\n\nbut the dead can instruct the living\n\nEmpty faces\n\nBodies moving but hearts are not beating\n\nnor is their blood warm\n\nLegion that shuns no sacrifice\n\nTheir lives have already been given\n\nCertain of their destiny\n\nThey are ready to merge in cosmos\n\nWalking on a black earth towards a dead sun\n\nAbandon human face and flesh\n\nIncorporeal, but surrounding all of us\n\nAbandon human face and flesh\n\nThe other dimension twisted where\n\nthe words of man do not reach\n\nWhere the serpent will devour itself\n\nTo fulfil the prophecy they are ready to\n\nset the world on fire!\n\nHarvesters of death\n\nWalking among men\n\nFor a few short moments before the end\n\nWalking on a black earth towards a dead sun\n\nLegion that shuns no sacrifice\n\nTheir lives have already been given\n\nCertain of their destiny\n\nThey are ready to merge in cosmos\n\nHarvesters of death\n\nWalking among men\n\nFor a few short moments before the end\n\n6. Serpent-Angel\n\nFrom the night crawled the serpent\n\nSeduced to its toils\n\nPlunged wisdom into mind, entangled into body\n\nMoved in silence like the wind\n\nWas present everywhere\n\nWatching over your every step, the Serpent angel\n\nObscured one's sight\n\nBut yet gave vision to see all\n\nOpen your eyes in a new world\n\nThe paths have now come together and the destination has unveiled itself\n\nYou can now abandon your hollow shell\n\nYour ragged thoughts are now crystal clear\n\nAll the elements are taking their place\n\nThe final encounter with the \"others\"\n\nwill start the last phase\n\nCome on and step into the circle\n\nWe hold the key to the cypher...\n\nYou bear inside your mind\n\nEclipse now now the face of God that I have become in this darkened image\n\nI move in silence like the wind, I'm present everywhere\n\nI'm watching over your every step\n\nI'm the Serpent-Angel\n\nI gave you vision to see all\n\nNow open your eyes in a new world\n\nThe paths have now come together and the destination has unveiled itself\n\nYou can now abandon your hollow shell\n\n7. Whisper From The Depths\n\nThe depths are calling\n\nDark waters whisper, tempting to fall beneath\n\nWhere no light shimmers\n\nBeneath the surface\n\nthose sunken eyes stare at to the sky\n\nThe broken star shines brighter\n\nthan the others now it's time.\n\nThe final breath, cold water, fills the tired lungs.\n\nDark veil embraces, your path here is done\n\nSink in cold womb\n\nYou are at the gates of your destiny\n\nDrive away sickness\n\nDrive away death\n\nBeneath the surface\n\nThe final breath\n\nThe depths are calling\n\nDark waters whisper, tempting to fall beneath\n\nWhere no light shimmers\n\nSink in cold womb\n\nYou are at the gates of your destiny\n\nForget yourself and find greater connection\n\nDrive away sickness\n\nDrive away death\n\nBeneath the surface\n\nThe final breath\n\n8. Ecstasy Of Black Light\n\nThe skies have opened\n\nThe final chapter is writing itself\n\nHallucinations become reality\n\nThe insane now holds sanity\n\nThe structures of reality are twisted\n\nAs prey transforms into beast\n\nEvery creature is now equal\n\nin the eye of Zero Nexus\n\nThey are all predators of apocalypse\n\nThe gateway is open\n\nThe chosen 9 will enter into the eye\n\nThe circle is finally complete\n\nNow it's time to break it\n\nAs prey transforms into beast\n\nEvery creature is now equal\n\nin the eye of Zero Nexus\n\nThey are all predators of apocalypse\n\nThe vortex opens\n\nThe chosen 9 will enter into the eye\n\nThe circle is finally complete\n\nNow it's time to break it\n\nThe journey that once was their calling\n\nhas now given them Ecstasy of black light\n\nFree from their human form they are now\n\npart of the chaos they once reached for\n\n9.
