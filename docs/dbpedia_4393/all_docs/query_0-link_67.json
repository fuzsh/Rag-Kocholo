Ruins\n\nÂ\n\nThe giants holding world crumbled\n\nand the blow beyond the stars\n\nFroze the entire face of the Earth\n\nThe gateway opened and seismic waves\n\nflushed the living\n\ninto the rivers of the Underworld\n\nÂ\n\nFloating in your own feces ha!\n\nIs this the creature that was an image of their God?\n\nÂ\n\nThese are the scorched steps of mankind â ruins!\n\nThis is travesty of life â ruins!\n\nÂ\n\nThey are too weak to be godlike!\n\nThey are too weak to even fight back when given a chance to do so!\n\nÂ\n\nBehold the human agony in all its glory\n\nIs this not what you have been waiting for\n\nIs this not what you have been trying to foreseen\n\nFor as long as you have lived\n\nÂ\n\nThese are the scorched steps of mankind â ruins!\n\nThis is travesty of life â ruins!\n\nÂ\n\nAre you willing to eat\n\nthe flesh of your fellow man\n\nIf notâ¦\n\nThen into to pit\n\nYou must crawl\n\nand die!\n\nÂ\n\nIt is time to arise\n\nIt is to conquer these ruins\n\nÂ\n\nInto the pitâ¦\n\nYou must crawlâ¦\n\nFlesh will rottenâ¦\n\nBones will turn to dustâ¦\n\nÂ\n\nThe giants holding this world crumbled\n\nand the blow beyond the stars\n\nFroze the entire face of the Earth\n\nThese are the scorched steps of mankind â ruins!\n\nThis is travesty of life â ruins!\n\nÂ\n\n2. Dawnless Days\n\nAnd so it happened\n\nDawn ceased to exist\n\nAnd darkness became the law\n\nThe fact that only few percent\n\nof human population survived\n\nis overwhelming\n\nÂ\n\nWith a smile I greet this new world order\n\nÂ\n\nThe true nature of things is starting to reveal its grin\n\nTo witness chaos in all its glory â feasting among the Earth\n\nÂ\n\nWe are privileged\n\nWe are the riders of dawnless days\n\nWe are the chosen ones\n\nWe are the dead who will hunt down the living\n\nWe are the predators\n\nWe are the riders of dawnless days\n\nÂ\n\nTress petrify\n\nAnd seas have turned\n\nInto drowning pools of life\n\nAcid rains hammering down\n\nThunderstorms cast the only light\n\nÂ\n\nWe are privileged\n\nWe are the riders of dawnless days\n\nWe are the chosen ones\n\nWe are the dead who will hunt down the living\n\nWe are the predators\n\nWe are the riders of dawnless days\n\nÂ\n\nThese dawnless days will go on eternally\n\nAnd the skies are not cleared\n\nThe rays of Sun cannot penetrate\n\nThrough the black horizon\n\nÂ\n\nThere are some survivors\n\nHiding in these ruins\n\nIt is our mission to hunt them down\n\nand make sure\n\nthat we are the only ones left\n\nÂ\n\nÂ\n\n3. Until No Life Breeds\n\nIn vain they fight\n\nThey have fell from their throne\n\nÂ\n\nAs the light faded from the horizon\n\nThe ones of the nocturne awake\n\nDarkness grants them its blessing\n\nAnd sends them out to hunt\n\nÂ\n\nAir is steaming as the horde leave its nest\n\nFrost is covering the ground\n\nAll life shall be raped by the dark\n\nÂ\n\nAs the resources expire\n\nThe only thing that keeps the last bits of human race going\n\nIs pure instinct of survival\n\nÂ\n\nA herd of weaklings is lost in the ruins\n\nAnd panic is starting to rise\n\nThe troops of decay smell their fear and are ready to strike\n\nÂ\n\nAir is steaming as the horde leave its nest\n\nFrost is covering the ground\n\nAll life shall be raped by the dark\n\nÂ\n\nThe scavenger of apocalypse\n\nWill hunt you down\n\nÂ\n\nUntil no life breeds\n\nUntil no life breeds\n\nUntil no life breeds\n\nÂ\n\nBehind the curtains of thorns\n\nFar from the landscape of demise\n\nÂ\n\nAir freezes as the horde leaves the nest\n\nAll life shall be raped by the dark\n\nÂ\n\nÂ\n\n4. Ash Statues\n\nFields, as far as the eye can see\n\nFilled with human remains\n\nScorched to their feet\n\nÂ\n\nThey were all praising the Sun\n\nand this was their reward\n\nNow they form the army of ash statues\n\nÂ\n\nInto the shadows you must flee\n\nAnd whom ever can find a path there\n\nShall become the king!\n\nÂ\n\nAnd from that stone made domain\n\nShall the destiny of all remaining lives be made\n\n5. Disembodiment\n\nThe killing fields have now gone quiet\n\nAnd you are torn apart by the cold winds\n\nWhat lies ahead behind the reapers grin?\n\nA weight too heavy to be carried away\n\nÂ\n\nAs I step through the black mirror\n\nIt is just a tiny step towards the chaos\n\nSoon devouring cosmos\n\nÂ\n\nAs Earth leaves behind new portals open\n\nÂ\n\nAm I trapped forever in this orbit of emptiness?\n\nWill I ever assimilate\n\nÂ\n\nThe more you suffer\n\nThe more you see\n\nThe more you give\n\nThe more you gain\n\nThe more you burn\n\nThe more you can take\n\n6. Malicious Winds\n\nThis coldness goes straight to the bones\n\nIt is not from this world\n\nIt is not normalâ¦\n\nAs if the entire planet was just waiting\n\nFor something to appear\n\nFrom the bottomless darkness\n\nSomething to devour the remains of\n\nYour solar system\n\nÂ\n\nThe sky howls in a way\n\nThat there is no peace\n\nDuring these starless nights\n\nOnly the eyes of the nocturne\n\nCan be seen\n\nThey will hunt you down\n\nOne by one\n\nÂ\n\nHe will arrive beyond space and time\n\nÂ\n\nMalicious winds\n\nCarry my flesh\n\nwith your wings\n\nTo face the destroyer of worlds\n\nMalicious winds\n\nShow me how it all ends\n\nÂ\n\nFrom beyond space and time\n\nHe is coming\n\nFrom the bottomless darkness\n\nHe will arrive\n\nThe traveler!\n\n7. Traveler Of Unlight\n\nTraveler of unlight\n\nTremble the cosmic order\n\nUnleash the black beast\n\nTo the halls of golden temple\n\nBloom in rays of black Sun\n\nÂ\n\nFrom within the void\n\nAnd from void within\n\nSummon the starless skies\n\nÂ\n\nHear the call of a dying race\n\nCombine my voice\n\nTo your black stream of the dead\n\nAs I join without a second thought\n\nThe knowledge through aeons\n\nPierce my spine\n\nÂ\n\nTraveler of unlight\n\nTremble the cosmic order\n\nUnleash the black beast\n\nTo the halls of golden temple\n\nBloom in rays of black Sun\n\nÂ\n\nMy dreams of Saturn now come alive\n\nAs my flesh melts from my bones\n\nThis calming blacknessâ¦\n\nAt last my thoughts are clear\n\nTowards the gateway\n\nI travel beyond the veil\n\nof cosmos\n\nInto chaos\n\nÂ\n\nI abandon this weak flesh\n\nTo set my will free\n\nÂ\n\nTraveler of unlight\n\nTremble the cosmic order\n\nUnleash the black beast\n\nTo the halls of golden temple\n\nBloom in rays of black Sun\n\nÂ\n\n8. Devolution\n\n[Instrumental]\n\n9. Slumbering Giant\n\nForgotten in the turns of time\n\nExistence denied\n\nA tamed beast tied up in chains that wonât last\n\nBuried beneath the surface of this dying planet\n\nWandering in cosmic disharmony\n\nFar beyond the structures of reality\n\nÂ\n\nThere is no hope for your pitiful race\n\nYou cannot bury the old\n\nI will arise\n\nWith joy I observe as your flame slowly suffocates\n\nÂ\n\nObserver under ice\n\nA beast tied up in chains that wonât last\n\nItâs time to purify the scum of this planet\n\nDying planet\n\nÂ\n\nWandering beyond the structures of reality\n\nÂ\n\n10. Nomad\n\nDeserts of ice to be crossed\n\nMountains of iron scrap to be climbed\n\nTo find a way through\n\nJust to start it all over again\n\nÂ\n\nKill â and you might live\n\nFall down â and you are done with\n\nÂ\n\nLimbo of death landscape is endless\n\nAnd those still alive are your enemies\n\nÂ\n\nAs a nomad you must hunt in wasteland\n\nAbandon all humanity, forget the faces\n\nÂ\n\nDeserts of ice to be crossed\n\nMountains of iron scrap to be climbed\n\nTo find a way through\n\nJust to start it all over again\n\nÂ\n\nKill â and you might live\n\nFall down â and you are done with\n\nÂ\n\nLimbo of death landscape is endless\n\nÂ\n\nUnlike in war where you fight for a âgreater causeâ\n\nHere you fight just for yourself\n\nJust to live another day and wait\n\nUntil thereâs nothing to be done\n\nÂ\n\nAs a nomad you must hunt in wasteland\n\nAbandon all humanity, forget the faces\n\nBurn all emotions in stake of decay\n\nÂ\n\nTo take another step towards the end\n\nAnd feel more alive than before\n\nAbandon all of humanity\n\nForget the faces\n\nBurn all emotions in stake of decay\n\nAs a nomad you must hunt\n\nUnlike in war where you fight for a greater cause\n\nHere you fight just for yourself\n\nJust to live another day and wait until\n\nThereâs nothing to be done\n\nTo take another step towards the end\n\nAnd feel more alive than before\n\n11.
