        "text": "Chapter Text\n\nA fire burned over a bed of red embers, where light sprung and wavering shadows danced along the gilded walls of Dany’s rooms. A sharp, sweet scent of lemon balm and myrtle filtered through them to prevent the smell of sickness from pervading. The windows had been left open, letting in fresh air as the afternoon slipped into evenfall.\n\nSitting on a carved chair, its base surmounted by the winged heads of the Harpy, Aemond rested his temple against them, gazing after Daenerys, wrapped in her sleeping silks, her eyes shut as her chest labored to rise. Every so often, a pillow would fall to the floor or the blanket would be pushed off which he duly put back in its place. There was no one else but them, which he vastly preferred these days instead of the steady, rustling background of maids, pages, physicians, and stewards going about.\n\nWhen he was not at council or consulting with his lieutenant-generals, he spent what little time he had with Daenerys, often waiting upon her himself much to the servants’ collective bewilderment. Only the girls showed a measure of understanding as they saw to it he was given what he needed without being asked and would quietly slip away upon his arrival, leaving him with the queen.\n\nHere we are again, Dany, Aemond looked upon her lovely face. How many times had he found himself here, besides this very bed? So focused was he on her breathing that any who observed him became exhausted by the sheer intensity of his purpose as he sat there transfixed, clutching her hand to reassure himself she was still alive. Her heart was beating, her lips drawing breath. Her eyes would open and he would have her in his arms again, a minute longer, an hour more, a day, years.\n\nAn awful weight crushed him from the inside as he now faced a terrible extremity. He could feel it physically choking the life out of him slowly, inch by inch. A vise from which he could not escape from and the harder he fought against it, the tighter it wound.\n\nSince the disastrous interview with Kinvara, he had thrown himself with a vengeance to the war effort as preparing for battle was something he could at least control.\n\nBut where magic was concerned, he was powerless.\n\nA fact that the High Priestess seemed to take subtle pleasure in, sending him to an unfathomable level of rage he had not felt since the Dance.\n\nFor every answer she gave, he had ten more questions and every bit of knowledge he could piece together merely cemented his despair. In his mind’s eye, from memory and bitter speculation, he imagined Alys, standing atop her broken tower, locking her blue eyes onto him and casting the spell that would consign him to a fate worse than the death he was meant to have. Daemon, Caraxes, Vhagar. Three for one, one for three. The spilling of royal blood and fire from the ensuing battle was what enabled his crossing into this time.\n\nIt wasn’t enough, though.\n\nAemond gazed down at Dany, bile rising up from his stomach as he recalled Kinvara’s words.\n\nHis reawakening had required another sacrifice yet there had been no other when Alys sent him ahead through the centuries. Dany’s pyre. The God’s Eye. Fire and water. Lives lost, dragons hatching. A nexus of circumstance and probability converging into focus, providing the pathway from past into future. He should not have lived and yet, a jest played by the gods perhaps, the magic had failed.\n\nThe moment his flesh came back to his bones and blood coursed through his veins again, when his lungs took in air once more, his eye opening to light, he had inadvertendly blighted the life of the only living mortal who was left in the ashes.\n\nHis savior.\n\n…and victim.\n\n“...Aemond?”\n\nSeeing Dany struggling to sit up, he shot out of his seat and helped her recline along her pillows so she would not have to exert herself any further than necessary. He seized a nearby goblet that Irri had left behind and was about to fill it with water when Dany shook her head. Setting it down at a table, he held her hand. Her face glistened beneath a fine sheen of perspiration and when he felt her cheek, it was cool.\n\n“What day is it?” She finally was able to say.\n\n“Rest now, Dany.” The underside of his thumb stroked her brow as he knelt by her bedside but she stirred beneath his touch and closed her fingers around his wrist, stopping him.\n\nHer eyes looked into his and it took the combined weight of formative training along with dire necessity for him to keep his own gaze neutral as he stared right back, determined not to let the facade slip. He could not let her see.\n\nNot this.\n\nNever this.\n\n“Tell me what has happened,” she whispered when he turned away to dampen a cloth and wipe her face with it.\n\n“The Voltanenes will be at the Bay in three days’ time. Qarth declared against us and is making way to Astapor.” He was extremely careful not to express the slightest veneer of emotion.\n\nDaenerys was silent as she lay in her bed and when she spoke again, it was with resolve. Weak as she was, there was an undeniable shade of strength in her voice. “Then I must go.”\n\n“Go where?”\n\n“To answer Volantis, Myr, Tyrosh, Lys, and Qarth. With fire and blood.” She made to stand but he stopped her before she could set her feet on the ground.\n\nAemond easily held her in place with one arm. “You are in no condition to ride Drogon, let alone walk. Allow others to lead in your stead.”\n\n“I will not have people risking their lives for my sake alone when it is within my power to shield and protect them.” There was unbreakable steel in her words. “I am the Queen of the Seven Kingdoms. I belong to those who cast off their chains and took up their spears for me. I must therefore take up my dragons for them.”\n\n“Daenerys.” He was torn by searing pride, guilt, and anger. “ You. Cannot. Go.”\n\n“I was not making a request.” The dragon’s daughter would not take no for an answer but neither would its son.\n\n“I will be the one taking command of the western front for Mereen’s defenses with the Golden Company and Silver Legions. Grey Worm will head off the Qartheen with the Unsullied and the Dothraki that remain to us in the city.” Aemond said, fully expecting a quarrel to break out between them because he had acted without her authority. At this juncture, he did not care if she got angry but the fallout never came.\n\nHer hand instead sought his. Her face was drawn as she steadily gazed up at him.\n\n“I must.” She repeated. “I need to finish what I began in Slaver’s Bay. The duty falls to me too, Aemond. You cannot fight all my battles for me.”\n\nYes, I can, and will! He wanted to scream at her. I was Protector once and will be so again! If not for you, what else?\n\nBut he kept silent and attempted no reply as he remained where he was, rendered immobile in helpless fury.\n\n“My love, look at me.” Dany murmured and when he refused, he felt her fingertips gently slide along his jaw and turn his chin so his eye would meet her own again.\n\n“We are dragonriders, you and I, and we will win with our dragons. If you are to lead the Golden Company and my Silvers, then I should go with the Unsullied and the khalasar. The Dothraki will not heed Grey Worm’s command save mine and yours. You know this.”\n\nLosing his temper, he snapped, “They are a savage, undisciplined mob and I am not their khal—”\n\n“ You are, as I am their khaleesi. They only follow the strong. They believe in you, as I do. If you will not have them fight alongside you, then have them do so with me. My bloodriders are fierce and can rise to this challenge in the east.”\n\n“Dany, you have never ridden into battle on a dragonmount. What if the Qartheen have scorpion bolts? Would you even know how to evade them? We never practiced that, let alone trained any of the dragons for it. There is still much I have yet to teach you.”\n\nAnd so little time.\n\n“I conquered Astapor, Meereen, and Yunkai when the dragons were mere hatchlings.” Dany quietly reminded him. “Why do you doubt me? Are my victories of so little worth to you?”\n\n“I’ve never questioned your capabilities. It is your lack of experience and now your health that concerns me.” He moved away. “I am not alone in thinking this. The small council will speak against your participation. To imperil your life…”\n\nWhen the succession is not secure. When we are neither married nor have an heir of our own blood.\n\nHe did not dare finish.\n\n“In Valyria, you and I agreed to rule together, as one.” She was unwavering as mountains by a storm ridden sea. “We will therefore defend as one and fight as one. If you are to stop Volantis in the west, I must strike Qarth in the east. How can you fight in two places at once? There is no other way.”\n\nHis hand curled into a constrained fist, the knuckles going white. “I can handle it myself.”\n\n“You said you would want us to be equals and act as a partner with me, not against me. I had taken those words as truth then. Are you telling me now you spoke false?” She met his coldness with sincerity and he could not bear it.\n\n“I will not have you in harm’s way, Dany.”\n\nThe way she was looking at him made him feel so much worse.\n\nFor in this moment, he was forcefully reminded of a terrible time when he had tried to coerce Helaena, still in the throes of grief, to ride Dreamfyre into battle when he marched on the Riverlands. It had been an outrageous proposal then as it would have been now. He was met with extreme resistance from all parties and Alicent, appalled he even had the temerity to demand such a thing, stopped speaking to him altogether.\n\nHow eager, desperate he had been, to put his sister in danger with no care or thought to what happened. And here he was, just as eager and desperate. Except this time, it was to save the woman he loved. He did not protect Helaena then. So what made him think he could protect Daenerys now?\n\n“I have been in harm’s way since I was born. The Usurper’s knives followed Viserys and I wherever we went. Facing an enemy on a battlefront would be no different.” Dany said, recalling him from his bitter reverie.\n\n“You may not survive this.” Aemond tried to break through this unshakeable certainty of hers. “Are you hearing me? This is going to be different. You could die. Drogon could be struck down. It could be an arrow that finds you or a spear tearing your dragon’s wing in midair. If that happens, how do you expect us to prevail? Without you, we would not only lose the heir to the Iron Throne but everything else we achieved in Essos. Tell me, Dany. How would we continue when there is nothing left of you?”\n\n“You speak of succession.”\n\nThough she spoke without anger, there was an undeniable vulnerability in her voice that made him inwardly flinch. It would have been better if they argued than to see her wounded like this. Once, he would have shunned and reviled it as weakness. Cruelty was second nature to him in those days. Yet when it came to Daenerys, as often was the case now, he could not bring himself to express let alone feel any of that. Only mutual sadness, if not pity, for what she had lost.\n\nHe reached for her hand and held it tight.\n\n“We have each other. We don’t need anyone else.”\n\n“Then why,” she asked, “is it fair to have you risk life and limb yet you would have me content to lie here? Do you think I could do that, knowing you would be out there, endangering yourself in my stead?” Her words sunk into him and in the heavy silence that followed, she bade him to look at her again. “I have to do this. You know I do.”\n\nSlowly, he forced himself to and clung to the sight of her, trying to hold onto every detail. The love in her eyes, the compassion reflected in her countenance.\n\n“When we were in the Red Waste…” He was not entirely certain why he was asking this question now or for what purpose but something was compelling him to do so. “Do you remember when I fell sick? The memory of it is a blur to me. But someone was always there, giving me water and passing food to my lips from their own because I hadn’t the strength to eat. Truth be told, I thought it was one of your handmaids.” He paused, unsure how to go on.\n\n“One night, I dreamed someone held me in their arms and they…” He could no longer bear the weight of Dany's stare and stumbled over his words. “They let me….”\n\nHe bit his lip, not knowing how exactly to put it into words when Dany squeezed his hand.\n\n“....you were dying.” She said softly. “The nearest city was still a hundred leagues. I did not know what else to do other than give you what I had. There was nothing else.”\n\nShe held a hand to her breast, where he had fed from in delirium.\n\n“But you were ill.” He could almost hear the rising echo of Dany’s cries from her tent in the desert. All those nights when he was forced to hear her suffering from abscesses that had developed in her chest because the milk within was no longer drawn off.\n\n“Only after we stopped.” She confessed in a whisper. “I didn’t say anything because....I didn’t think you would understand. I wasn't sure how you would react either.”\n\nOvercome, if not stricken with a host of conflicting emotions, Aemond did not know where to look or what to say. Involuntarily, he started to withdraw but Dany leant over to catch his face with her hands.\n\n“Are you ashamed?” Her voice was tight and her eyes glistened as she searched his face for affirmation. A sign that he would reject her.\n\n“I was a stranger to you.” There was a strangling pain in his throat he tried to swallow down. “I was selfish and unkind....I hated you, even blamed you. Yet you helped me anyway. How could you do that? Why would you even save me someone like me?”\n\n“I would do anything to save you.” Daenerys pulled him closer and tilted her lips so she could press them against his temple. “I love you.”\n\nShe kissed him so tenderly, thoughtfully, as though this singular act could somehow lessen the agony that was tearing him apart.\n\nTrembling, he seized her into his arms and kissed her back in fervent intensity. Like a man condemned holding onto the last shred of mercy left to him, in the slim hope of rescue. He crushed her as she drew out a choking gasp from his lips and had she glimpsed his face, she would have seen his wretched unhappiness. The terror carved beneath his jeweled eye and visceral desperation that had now taken hold of him. Plain as day, there was his love, all consuming and ever deep, and the undisguised joy of having hers. But eclipsing them was fear and despair.\n\nThat she had proven beyond doubt she would do anything to save him and if she was to ever learn the truth of the curse that lay between them, he knew what she would choose.\n\nBut by the gods, old and new, with hardened resolve, he would never allow it.\n\n“ I’m sorry .” He shakingly whispered against her mouth.\n\nI’m sorry I crossed into your time.\n\nFor taking your life away, at the expense of mine.\n\nT hat I won’t be with you in the years to come nor rule beside you after we retake the Iron Throne.\n\nBecause by then, it will be too late and between us both, only you must remain.\n\nOnly you.\n\n*\n\n*\n\n*\n\n*\n\nIn the dark, Aemond stood outside with both hands resting on the edge of his balcony, watching the glimmering cityscape as night rolled in.\n\nBehind him, the High Priestess waited in the shadows like a sweep of bleeding red against the blackness surrounding them.\n\n“Before all else, you will swear to me, here and now, that Daenerys is to know nothing of this blood magic. I will not have her sacrificing herself. The price will be paid by me and me alone.” Aemond coldly stated the terms without turning around. “You and your priests will take every measure to maintain her survival. When the Seven Kingdoms are retaken and she is safely placed on the Iron Throne, you can do what you will with me.”\n\n“If that is your wish, my king.”\n\n“It is a command.”\n\nHe faced her with unbridled rage as the lights of Meereen illuminated his profile in a thin outline of gold. “Know this, Priestess. Betray me at your peril. If I find the smallest reason to suspect you, I will turn you, your god, your temples, and all your adherents to ashes.”\n\nA haunting silence stretched long between them, punctuated only by the distant sounds of everyday life coursing through Meereen.\n\nKinvara lowered her eyes in a show of deference. “The Lord of Light requires us all to submit. Apart from your life, what else can you give up in exchange, to R’hollor’s will?”\n\n“You would try to make a believer out of me?” He was losing patience fast. “Very well. I denounce the Seven, the gods of Old Valyria, the Harpy, the Lyseni goddesses, the Faceless God, the shadows in Asshai. Shall I reject every faith in Essos? Will that be enough for your god?”\n\n“A king’s devotion is aplenty,” Kinvara was untouched and unmoved by his anger. “But this continent, Westeros too, has lived in darkness for far too long.” She looked to the skies where a smattering of constellations burned white in the night. “You and your queen desire to unite the Free Cities under a new Valyrian banner. Out of the ruins, you will begin anew, helping the Lord’s Chosen return peace and cleanse its grounds of the living curse that haunt it still.”\n\nHer gaze was solemn as they looked at each other.\n\n“Do you remember what you saw that day, when you and Queen Daenerys fled the isle on your dragons?” Her question was tinged with knowing. “You saw them, didn’t you? The figures in the flames?”\n\nShe closed the distance between them until she was just a few paces away.\n\n“Should I recount how those monsters came to be?” Her voice reawakened a chill of terror within him. “Shall I tell you their names? And who they were before?”\n\nWhen he did not answer, she smiled.\n\n“It is the Lord’s will that your victories are assured. An empire shall rise with House Targaryen and follow the one true faith. All other beliefs are but heresy to the word of R’hllor. Let the Red Temple sanctify your kingdoms and rule. When the Iron Throne is yours, you will tear down the Sept and its idols. You will command the Andals to forsake their Seven and baptize their lords in fire if they refuse. Do this, and our temples will commit themselves unto you and your queen.”\n\n“Swear upon your god then.” Aemond looked at her with pure contempt.\n\n“He is your god too, my lord.”\n\nHe seized her wrist and twisted it to the side so as to cause her pain. Still, she did not react. He must not be afraid. He was blood of the dragon, as was Dany.\n\n“ You will save her…. ” he bore down on Kinvara. “....and you will keep her safe .”\n\nHe dug his nails in so deep as to draw blood yet she made no attempt to stop him.\n\n“Heartless prince, sorrowful king,” the priestess was soft in her condemnation. “You do not know what you ask…yet you shall have it. By the grace and might of R’hllor, I swear to you, Aemond Targaryen, to preserve the life of Daenerys Stormborn. Does that satisfy, sire?”\n\nHe flung her hand aside and dismissed her without another word.\n\nWhat is done is done.\n\nFaithless, his eye took in Meereen, the stars, the night, and the threat that was to still come.\n\nThe horror of his promise, yet to be fulfilled, as he consoled himself with dreams of Dany’s empire and the life she would live without him in due time."
