        "text": "Thultanthar (\"Shade\" in the language), also known as the Shade Enclave and the City of Shade, was a flying city, created in the year -1471 DR, some 1,483 years after created the first such floating city. Thultanthar's high mage known only as had been experimenting with the for some time and had successfully shifted the entire city into the Plane of Shadow mere days before cast and temporarily destroyed the in the Year of Sundered Webs (-339 DR). For some reason though, Lord Shadow could not move the city back to the . It took weeks but eventually, they managed to return to Netheril, or at least what was left of it. Searching for survivors for days, the city floated over the ruins of the Netherese empire. Finding none, Lord Shadow assumed it was the work of the and began planning his revenge. He stopped though, when he realised that one city was not a match for them and that his subjects were likely the last of the empires people. He abandoned those plans and retreated back into the Plane of Shadow, vowing that one day, they would return and reestablish the empire. The city's clerics of cast and saw what had really happened, but only informed the noble families, presumably on the whim of Shar herself for some reason. The excursion into the Plane of Shadow, due to unforeseen circumstances has lasted much longer than Lord Shadow anticipated. So for over 1,700 years, the inhabitants have battled the and the other shadowy horrors of the realm, while each generation became gradually more attuned to the plane itself, becoming what are now known as Shadovar.\n\nIn the Year of Wild Magic (1372 DR), Thultanthar returned to Faer√ªn after the elf finished a spell to bring Shade back to where the Shadovar found themselves floating over the . Almost immediately, the princes of Thultanthar (now known more commonly by its translated name of Shade) have been busy looking for Netherese ruins and artifacts as well as spying on people and places that could possibly hinder their ultimate goal of creating a new Netheril in their image.\n\nTelamont Tanthul and the Princes of Shade[]\n\nShade is ruled by the Most High , a powerful Shadovar / of the . Telamont is actually the original Lord Shadow who was alive in the time of Netheril. He has kept himself alive this long through powerful magic but may resort to lichdom at some point. One day he intends to inform the Shadovar of his true identity to inspire them all to victory.\n\nHe returned to Toril with his twelve sons, the , all potent warriors and Shadow Weave spellcasters."
