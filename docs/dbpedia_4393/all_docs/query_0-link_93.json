        "text": "Finnish symphonic black metallers Shade Empire have announced their sixth studio album „Sunholy“ will be released on 15th September via Candlelight Records. Ahead of the release the band have unveiled their captivating new video for first single, „In Amongst the Woods“:\n\nMixed by Chris Edrich (Devin Townsend, Leprous, Alcest) and mastered by Pierrick Noël (Klone), with Fleshgod Apocalypse’s Francesco Ferrini responsible for the orchestrations and Andy Reich at Collapse Of Art completing the artwork, „Sunholy“ is a long-aged piece of art and labour of love. Embodying the most comprehensive Shade Empire effort to date, the lyrics are thematically inspired by the Jonestown tragedy, a mass murder-suicide of the Peoples Temple cult, but there’s also a fuller contemplation and exploration of the current state of the world.\n\nQuelle & ©: Head of PR"
