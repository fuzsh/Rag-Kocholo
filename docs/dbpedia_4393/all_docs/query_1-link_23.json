        "text": "1. Conjuration\n\nI am the crusher of all your gods and saviours.\n\nBringer of extermination, wielder of rage.\n\nYour old believes, patterns made of lies, shall be erased by the rise of new kind of misanthropic wrath.\n\nThe earth is scorched, as we dwell towards the gates of our mortal existence.\n\nThe twisted wheel of time is now ready for the arrival of new kind of sovereign.\n\nSay farewells to your precious memories.\n\nIt's time to enter a whole new reality, where pain is pleasure and pleasure is our only passion.\n\nI am the almighty the lord from the world of chaos.\n\nBringer of destruction and grief, creator of new world... of worms.\n\nSay farewells to your precious memories.\n\nIt's time to enter a whole new reality, where pain is pleasure and pleasure is our only passion.\n\nThe rush of torture in my veins... The shooting pain...\n\nAnd behold the creation of unholy shall inherit the throne that lies in this new dimension of pain.\n\nThe earth is scorched, as we dwell towards the gates of our mortal existence.\n\nThe twisted wheel of time is now ready for the arrival of new kind of sovereign.\n\nSay farewells to your former images and believes.\n\nIt's time to enter a different kind of reality, where all your hopes and fantasies are diversified in to nightmares.\n\n2. Pain & Pleasure\n\nAshes of burned memories cover my marks from infinity.\n\nBut just how many times I have walk this same path over again.\n\nI can see the shine of deception in your eyes.\n\nI was born to hate you and your kind.\n\nYou promise heaven, but all you can give is lies.\n\nI see the fear of being left alone in your eyes.\n\nAll those ruined lives, corrupted minds with lies.\n\nNow those forgotten souls scream your name from behind the graves.\n\nThere will be no tomorrow, there wasn't one today.\n\nEvery morning you will wake up to see your own image in hell.\n\nAnd the day will come when these lessons of suffering will be taught you and your kind too.\n\nI look into dimension of pain too absurd for man to realize.\n\nAnd with joy in my heart I can see your upcoming destiny.\n\nThe force of black mind is much greater than you can ever realize.\n\nI'll have my time to wait, but you will know my hate.\n\nI will teach you the arts of pain and pleasure.\n\nYou're just a coward behind your shell, you will rot in your own personal hell.\n\nFeel the heat of flames burn your flesh.\n\nWere the flames really there or only inside your head?\n\nFeel the razor cutting your skin, can't you see it's your own hand that moves the blade.\n\nThis is the art of pain and pleasure!\n\n3. Human Sculpture\n\nI declare war, war against human nature.\n\nI demand more, more from this dilemma you call life.\n\nYou're so blind, you cannot see that with our mind controlling solutions we have controlled your \"superior\" specie.\n\nYou have been living in a lie, we've been able to create you a never ending hallucination.\n\nAnd you think that you know what is fear, but how can you be afraid of something that you don't even know to exist.\n\nIn your mind you think that you are safe.\n\nYour life is as fragile as a sculpture made of glass.\n\nMankind is blessed with ignorance.\n\nAnd you still think that your God.\n\nYou are nothing more than a human sculpture made of filth and disgrace.\n\nWith one single though I can change the course of future aeons...irrevocably.\n\nAnd you still think that you're God.\n\nYou are nothing more than a human sculpture made of filth and disgrace.\n\nI am the Tyrant, the tyrant of your world, the devil guides us to mysterious ways.\n\nExtreme mindfuck, total control?\n\nHypnotizing mental disorder?\n\nYou're so blind, you cannot see that with our mind controlling solutions we have controlled your \"superior\" specie.\n\nYou have been living in a lie, we've been able to create you a never ending hallucination.\n\nAnd you still think that you're God.\n\nYou are nothing more than a human sculpture made of filth and disgrace.\n\n4. Designed For Blood\n\nAgain the dusk rapes the light and blood red vision covers my sight.\n\nAgain I fall into a realm where battles are fought, within my mind.\n\nForbidden, forgotten am I the last of my kind?\n\nThe night is waiting for me, it cherishes with its might.\n\nLay your eyes up to the skies and behold the sight.\n\nThe stars have formed into a sign of Pentagram.\n\nUnder this cursed sky you shall combine your life with mine.\n\nI watch you trough the eyes of wolves.\n\nThe choirs of ravens it's my voice you hear.\n\nOh, how I love the night I get my strength from its might.\n\nI cannot live in the light of day I need the wine that runs through your veins.\n\nThis desire that keeps me alive, it is and shall forever be my guide.\n\nFaceless but yet my only shelter: the dark.\n\nHere I belong, I am designed for blood.\n\nThe dreams about house of God are all nothing but lies.\n\nAnd now you will see it with your own eyes.\n\nTake the flame, burn yourself, see there's no pain.\n\nThe only thing inside your head is the lust for more and more.\n\nMy days with God have never existed for I have failed in his eyes.\n\nYou won't dare to show me your face, father of lies.\n\nI watch you trough the eyes of wolves.\n\nThe choirs of ravens it's my voice you hear.\n\nI follow you until you are alone in the dark.\n\nI will baptize you with my desire for blood.\n\nFaceless but yet my only shelter: the dark.\n\nAgain I must vanish in to the night.\n\nAgain the dusk rapes the light and blood red vision covers my sight.\n\nAgain I fall into a realm where battles are fought, within my mind.\n\nForbidden, forgotten I am the last of my kind?\n\nThe night is waiting for me, it cherishes with its might.\n\nMy days with God have never existed for I have failed in his eyes.\n\n5. Creation Of Death\n\nEvery night I can see the sands of time running through my hands, yet every time it seems that something gives me another chance.\n\nAll the times I've tried to die, no years no words can ever tell.\n\nI want to leave but I'm doomed to live in this hell.\n\nSometimes I try to live. It feels like I'm made eternally to be.\n\nCome funeral winds, embrace my soul. Carry me to a place where I can...(die)\n\nEvery night I can see the reflections before my eyes, and every time I must see my precious ones die.\n\nOver and over again the cycle is never ending.\n\nOver and over again I hope for the veil of death over me to descend.\n\nI was born to be a creation of death. Again and again I must take my own life away.\n\nSometimes I try to live... I wish it would end. Again I have failed.\n\nCome funeral winds, embrace my soul. Carry me to a place where I can...(die)\n\nAgain I shed my life out from my veins.\n\n6. Ja Pimeys Laskeutui\n\nValon hetket jÃ¤Ã¤vÃ¤t aina varjoihin pimeyden.\n\nJa vielÃ¤ koittaa aika jolloin alkaa yÃ¶ ikuinen.\n\nValon surma, varjon voitto ja katso osat kÃ¤Ã¤ntyvÃ¤t, ei enÃ¤Ã¤ ylimielisten halveksuvia katseita.\n\nEi enÃ¤Ã¤ tekopyhyyttÃ¤. Saamme kulkea niinkuin on tarkoitettu.\n\nKuulkaa hiljaisuutta, kaikonneet ovat heidÃ¤n turhat sanansa.\n\nNyt orpoina seisotte vaikka luulitte olevanne niin mahtavia.\n\nMissÃ¤ on ylpeytenne nyt? Kadonnut on valtanne, jÃ¤Ã¤nyt alle varjon.\n\nMutta meidÃ¤n aikamme on vasta alkanut ja me tuomme takaisin sen mikÃ¤ meille kuuluu.\n\nAlati kasvava on joukkomme varjo ja sinne me rakennamme valtakuntamme.\n\nEi enÃ¤Ã¤ tekopyhyyttÃ¤...ja pimeys laskeutui.\n\n[English translation:]\n\nThe moments of light, always behind the shadows of darkness.\n\nAnd yet the time will come when the night becomes eternal.\n\nDeath of the light, triumph of the shadow, and look the parts turn,\n\nNo more pretentious looks of the arrogant!\n\nNo more hypocrisy,\n\nWe can move as intended!\n\nHear the silence, gone are their needless words.\n\nNow you stand as orphans, and you thought to be so mighty!\n\nWhere is your pride now? Gone is your power, fallen under the shadow\n\nBut our time has just begun, and we will bring back what belongs to us!\n\nContinuously is our force's shadow growing, and there we will build our empire!\n\nNo more hypocrisy, and the darkness has fallen!\n\n7. Extreme Form Of Hatred\n\nHad crushed glass in my eyes, but still my vision stays clear.\n\nHatred runs trough my veins, misanthropic is my mind. I have seen you all before, you and your \"better life\".\n\nIn order to maintain your peace you must begin war.\n\n(And you will fall)\n\nThe code in my mind: survival of the strongest.\n\nProgrammed in your mind: \"I am God\"\n\nWhere ever I go there shall be hell, for I am bringer of hell.\n\nI show you this new empire made of pain.\n\nYour truths are false to me, you try to be something that you can never be.\n\nHad rusty nails go trough my temples, but still my thoughts runs clear.\n\nTorture runs trough my veins, destructive is my mind.\n\nI have seen you all before, you and your \"better life\".\n\nIn order to maintain peace you must begin war. (And you will fall)\n\nThe Code in my mind: survival of the strongest.\n\nWhere ever I go there shall be hell, for I am bringer of hell.\n\nYou creatures shaped as man I cannot tolerate.\n\nYour truths are false to me, you try to be something that you can never be.\n\n8. Demonized\n\nI am the one without name, yet I'm known everywhere.\n\nI am the creator of your fears, bringer of your sins.\n\nSee the world that is for real, unlike the one you live in now.\n\nThe world you once saw trough the eyes of innocence was full of lies, and bitterness.\n\nDon't look for something that you cannot find.\n\nThe strength you seek is already part of you.\n\nUse it if you dare, don't be devoured by things that can tear your soul apart and will kill your heart with sins.\n\nYou'll have no trouble finding me, I have always walked among you.\n\nYou feel my breath on your skin, but you have never seen my face.\n\nI am the serpent within your mind, follow me into the dark.\n\nSee what's behind the black veil of mind.\n\nAs the brightest day turns into darkest night, the same way you enter from this life to the darker side.\n\nYour mind is full of black thoughts, your soul is in my control.\n\nThe earth you once walked on is now forgotten and gone forever.\n\nYou have no trouble finding me I have always walked among you. An angel in disguise.\n\nCan't you see that I'm the one you've been looking for? The serpent within your mind.\n\nThanks to ced_teryx for sending these lyrics.\n\nThanks to reapershadow666 for sending track #6 English translation.\n\nThanks to idolaattori for correcting track #6 lyrics.\n\nSubmits, comments, corrections are welcomed at webmaster@darklyrics.com\n\nSHADE EMPIRE LYRICS"
