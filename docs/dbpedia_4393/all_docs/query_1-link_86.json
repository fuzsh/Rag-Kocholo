        "text": "Ashes of burned memories cover my marks from infinity. but just how many\n\nTimes i have walk this same path over again.\n\nI can see the shine of deception in your eyes. i was born to hate you and\n\nYour kind. you promise heaven, but all you can give is lies.\n\nNow those forgotten souls scream your name from behind the graves. there\n\nWill be no tomorrow, there wasnâ€²t one today. every morning you will wake up\n\nTo see your own image in hell. and the day will come when these lessons of\n\nSuffering will be taught you and your kind too.\n\nI look into dimension of pain too absurd for man to realize. and with joy in\n\nMy heart i can see your upcoming destiny."
