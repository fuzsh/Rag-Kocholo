The empire returns.

Six years since the release of their critically acclaimed ode to hatred, Poetry Of The Ill-Minded, Finnish symphonic black metal icons Shade Empire unleash their latest anthological masterwork in the form of Sunholy. A portmanteau between the twin concepts of ‘sun’ and ‘unholy’, it is clear from the outset that Shade Empire are seeking to dissect the duality of light and dark, good and evil, and between the sacred and the heretical.

Featuring nine tracks of utterly annihilating power, Sunholy follows Shade Empire’s established tradition of dispensing thought-provoking thematic content alongside unparalleled brutality. The album’s 3 single offerings premeditate this. Opening track In Amongst The Woods immediately rages through the listener’s skull, offering little solace between its melodic vocals and callous screaming. Title track Sunholy displays the group’s trademark unrelenting force of symphonic black metal, and finally Torn Asunder underscores Shade Empire’s ability to seamlessly transition between dichotomous elements of melody and earth-scorching metallic impact.
