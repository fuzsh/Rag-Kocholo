The Mali Empire benefited from trans-Saharan trade networks through wealth accumulation, cultural exchange, and political expansion.

The trans-Saharan trade networks were a significant source of wealth for the Mali Empire. Gold, salt, and other valuable commodities were traded across these networks, with the Mali Empire controlling key trade routes and cities. This control allowed the empire to levy taxes on goods passing through its territory, providing a substantial source of income. The wealth accumulated from this trade was used to fund the empire's military, administrative, and cultural endeavours, contributing to its growth and stability.

Moreover, the trans-Saharan trade networks facilitated cultural exchange, which enriched the Mali Empire. Traders, scholars, and other travellers brought with them new ideas, technologies, and cultural practices. This included the spread of Islam, which became the dominant religion in the empire. The adoption of Islam not only influenced the empire's legal and administrative systems but also enhanced its prestige in the eyes of other Islamic societies, fostering diplomatic relations and further trade opportunities.

The trans-Saharan trade networks also enabled the Mali Empire to expand politically. The wealth generated from trade allowed the empire to maintain a large and powerful military, which was used to conquer and control more territories. These territories often included important trade routes or cities, further increasing the empire's wealth and power. Additionally, the empire's control over trade routes and its wealth attracted many people, leading to population growth and urbanisation. This, in turn, contributed to the development of a complex and sophisticated political system, with a centralised administration and a network of governors overseeing different regions.

In conclusion, the trans-Saharan trade networks were instrumental in the prosperity and expansion of the Mali Empire. They provided the empire with wealth, facilitated cultural exchange, and enabled political expansion, shaping the empire's history and legacy.
