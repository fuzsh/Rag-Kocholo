I'm not sure if a thread has already been made but I'm interested in all the ancient and medieval African coinage systems and other forms of currencies that was in use in different parts of the continent.

COINS: When were they minted? How far was their geographical distribution?

OTHER CURRENCIES: How was their value determined? What historic foreign coins were in circulation?

I will start with the coinage of the Sultanate of Mogadishu, a major power in the medieval Horn of Africa. The earliest coins date back to the 13th century and continued into the 17th century.

The coins had the names of 26 Sultans, and have been found in different parts of Somalia, the Horn, modern Dubai, Turkey and Iraq.

On the flip-side, foreign currencies found at Somali archaeological sites and private collections include Roman era coins, Fatimid coins, Venetian coins, Song and Ming Dynasty coins, and coins from medieval Sri Lanka and Vietnam.

Some regions, like Borno, used strips of cloth (and other goods) as currency and there was an exchange rate for cowries or Maria Theresa thalers. Maria Theresa thalers were used in the region until the end of the 19th century, I believe and were gradually phased out by British colonial rule.

The Mali Empire, besides using salt and gold dust, is also said to have had a large stash of gold dinars, for example during Mansa Musa's pilgrimage, he spent 50,000 gold dinars in Egypt alone.

Taking into account the mints of North Africa were probably using Malian gold for their coins, there might have been an agreement where they supplied the Mansas with dinars at a much common rate than we think, and the dinar was most likely just as important domestically as it was in foreign states.

I don't know. From Ibn Battuta I was under the impression that barter was more commonly used than coinage in 14th century Mali. Ibn Battuta's account alludes to using various goods to buy or exchange for food from women in villages or towns along the Niger.

'It could change everything': coin found off northern Australia may be from pre-1400 Africa - The Guardian

Experts believe they may have found a Kilwa coin that could change what we know about the history of global trade.

The medieval Indian Ocean trade network might have been a lot more expansive than we currently think.

That's not really what the article says. The least likely possibility is any sort of trade with native Australians. It's obviously a spin-off/casualty from trade routes we know about.

Well, it is one of the theories the article postulates as the reason for the coins being there, least likely or not. Both Kilwans and Mogadishans were well established in nearby Malacca and we know native Australians like the Yolngu traded with the Muslim Makassar people of neighbouring Indonesia. If rock art from the 1500s is anything to go by, their trepanging relationship was most likely centuries old.

In any case, its a fascinating discovery.

I'm leaning towards yes, because archaeologists active in the modern territories of the former Mali Empire retrieved clear evidence of innovative systems to purify gold and mint unmarked coins in medieval West Africa.

The only question now is whether they were ever marked by a ruler, if they were traded as currency in the traditional monetary sense across the trade roads of the Sahara region with a clear set value and whether this system of minting unmarked gold coins was abandoned for other forms of currency like salt.

Makes sense, the region clearly knew and likely dealt with currencies minted elsewhere so they would have knowledge of coin.

I've heard some of the untranslated manuscripts covered coins, not sure what's taking academics so long to go over them since they seem to have had them at a few universities in Europe for awhile iirc. I guess they must be harder to translate than expected.

Yes, Mansa Musa spent 50 thousand gold dinars in Egypt alone, during his pilgrimage to Makkah, which makes me wonder what the total damage would have been to the royal treasury since he went through several countries and regions before reaching the Holy City. The Malians were definitely no strangers to the benefits (and usage) of coins in transactions.

I hear he reversed the gold collapse by going in a massive spending spree to reverse it. Not sure how accurate or not that is.

He bought back all the gold he had spent to stabilise the markets. To be honest I wish he had spent his wealth on ships and military technology instead. If he had travelled through the Muslim world with a small entourage he could have picked up the most talented masons, blacksmiths, carpenters, scribes and shipbuilders on the way back from Makkah.
