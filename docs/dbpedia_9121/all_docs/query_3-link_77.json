Each was influenced by trade, contact with other cultures, religion, environmental factors, and invasions.\n\nGhana was the first of the three early African empires, lasting roughly from 300-1200 CE.\n\nMali came next and lasted from 1200-1500 CE.\n\nSongahi, the last of these three great empires, remained from 1464-1591 CE.

This pdf includes the entire book and has extensive information about the history, society, and culture of these civilizations.\n\nI. Ghana\n\nThere is still much we do not know about the ancient kingdom of Ghana. Most of what we do know comes from the writings of Arab travelers and historians who became aware of Ghana in the 8th Century CE. As a result, very little is known about the time before Arab contact.\n\nThe Empire of Ghana is the earliest known empire in the Western Sudan. It is believed that they had large armies, sophisticated systems of governance, and systems of taxation. Ghana was first populated of Soninke clans, who acted as intermediaries of the slat and gold traders in the region. The kingdom was ruled by a king who relied on tributary princes. This system of government had many similarities to the feudal system in Europe.\n\nOne lasting account of the Kingdom of Ghana is written by Al-Bakri, a member of a prominent Spanish Arab family who lived during the 11th century.\n\nThe Empire of Ghana thrived on the wealth of gold. It also increased its ability to trade when it acquired camels, as this allowed them to cross the Sahara with more ease and trade a wide variety of commodities—something that the ancient people could not do.\n\nThe Trans-Saharan Gold Trade (7th to 14th Century)\n\nHere is a lesson plan from the National Endowment for the Humanities about trade in ancient West Africa\n\nGo here for a brief overview of the Kingdom of Ghana\n\nDates and Time Frames\n\n300 CE—archeological evidence suggests that the Empire of Ghana existed by this time. It could have started earlier, however.\n\n8th Century CE.--Arab explorers discovered the Empire of Ghana in the 8th century CE. No one knows exactly when the empire started, but it is thought that by the time the Arabs arrived, the empire could already have been thriving for several centuries. The Tarikh as-Sudan, a history book that was written in the 17th century, claims that by the time the Arabs came Ghana had already been ruled by 22 different kings.\n\nSome historians think that they suffered from a military take over by the Almoravid Muslims of Morocco who wanted to spread Islam—others think that while these people did encroach upon the people of Ghana, it was not a violent jihad (holy war).\n\nThe King of Ghana lost his trade monopoly as gold trade routes began to change and other kingdoms began to mine gold in places not readily accessible to Ghana\n\nDrought affected Ghana by affecting the land and the people were no longer as successful with agriculture or raising cattle.\n\nPoint of Interest\n\nThe modern country of Ghana is not located in the same place as the Empire of Ghana. Modern Ghana is about 400 miles southeast of where the Empire was and is not related ethnically either. The modern country was named after liberation from colonization—choosing a name of one of the great African empires was symbolic of African independence and success.\n\nII. Mali\n\nThe Empire of Mali came into power as the Empire of Ghana was declining, and formed into one of the huge states of premodern Africa - it was 2,000 km wide (approximately 1200 miles).\n\nEquipped with a complex governmental structure headed by the king and managed by officials, sub-kings, and bureaucrats, Mali was also one of the first states south of the Sahara to see the new religion of Islam firmly take hold. The message of the Prophet was soon allied to the interest of the rulers of Mali, and a strong relationship between religion and the state quickly developed.\n\nLike Ghana, the Empire of Mali controlled the gold trade, but it also controlled the salt trade. Cowrie shells were used as currency which made the empire’s economic system advanced.\n\nIn the 15th century, the Mali Empire began to suffer defeats from without and within. Tuareg nomads conquered Timbuktu, and soon after, Songhai living in Gao began a revolt against Mali.\n\nRead more about the Mali Empire, its rulers, and eventual decline here.\n\nTimbuktu\n\nThe city of Timbuktu was a central spot on the trade routes and one of the most important places in medieval Africa.\n\nThe modern-day city is one of the sites included in the World's Most Endangered Sites.\n\nTimbuktu's Badass Librarians Checking Out Books Under Al-Qaida's Nose, NPR (April 23, 2016)\n\nImage of a Saracen king of West Africa, believed to be Mansa Musa, Emperor of Mali.\n\nFrom the Catalan Atlas of 1375\n\nDates and Time Frames\n\nTimbuktu founded by Tuareg herders.\n\n1235 CE—Sundiata rose to power.\n\n14th century CE—Mali reached its peak.\n\n1324—Mansa Musa, one of Mali’s most famous Kings, made a pilgrimage to Mecca. He also left behind him amazing buildings.\n\nUnder his rule, Timbuktu became a city known for learning.\n\nIn 1327, Mansa Musa oversaw the construction of the Sankore Madrasah, Mali's university. Thousands of students from across the empire would come to Timbuktu in order to study.\n\nMansa Musa, Thought to Be the Richest Person in History\n\n15th century CE—Mali was weakened by raids from the outside. The Tuareg Berbers took over the economy of Timbuktu. At the same time, the Empire of Songhai was becoming more powerful.\n\n1500—Songhai had overtaken what was left of Mali; scholarship and trade flourish under Songhai Empire.\n\n1591—Moroccans invade and deport scholars.\n\n1612—French colonial power replaces local rulers.\n\n1960—Mali gains independence from France.\n\nHere is an excerpt from Larry Brook's book \"Daily Life in Ancient and Modern Timbuktu\" that provides insight into their society as well as women's role in their society\n\nIII. Songhai\n\nMap of Songhai Empire\n\nThe people who made up the Songhai Empire in the 15th century CE actually started as fishermen and canoeists in the 9th century and formed a kingdom in the 11th century.\n\nThey lived in an area claimed by the Mali Empire during Mali’s reign, but Mali never managed to have control over them.\n\nAs Mali fell, Songhai rose under the control of Sonni Ali The Great. Songhai became what is now known as the greatest African empire ever.\n\nJoannes Leo Africanus, an Arab traveler visited Timbuktu in the Kingdom of Songhay early in the 1500s.\n\nHe left this description of that city.\n\nLearn more about the Songhai Empire's introduction into the Islamic world and its eventual decline here.\n\nFor background, see The Empires of Western Sudan from the Metropolitan Museum of Art.\n\nClick here for Interactive Timeline of Western Sudan, from 500 - 1600 A.D.\n\nDates and Time Frames\n\n15th century—Songhai Empire came into power under the leadership of Sonni Ali.\n\n1493—Sonni Ali died. Mohammed Toure took power. He led the empire with a more dedicated commitment to Islam than his predecessor. He also standardized systems of weights, measures, and currency. Consistency in these fields helped him consolidate power. Songhai came to its height under Toure’s leadership.\n\nHere is a UNESCO video about Askia's tomb and the empire of Songahi\n\nLate 16th Century—Songhai’s decline was aided by civil war. Because it was so big it was difficult to keep control over all the different people the Empire encompassed. Drought and disease also weakened the empire.\n\nCollapse: Why Do Civilizations Fail?
