Founded by Malinke prince Sundiata Keita, the empire flourished as a result of trade.\n\n---\n\nFrom. 700 to 1600 A.D. the ancient empires of Ghana (700-1100), Mali (800-1550) and Songhay (1300-1600) controlled vast areas of West Africa.\n\nModern oral traditions recorded that the Mandinka kingdoms of Mali or Manden had already existed several centuries before unification. This area was composed of mountains, savanna, and forest providing ideal protection and resources for the population of hunters. Those not living in the mountains formed small city-states.\n\nFounded by Sundiata Keita, the Mali Empire arose with the consolidation of several small Malinké Kingdoms in Ghana around the areas of the upper Niger River, following his victory over the kingdom of Sosso. The development of the empire began in its capital city of Niani, which was also Mansa Sundiata’s birthplace. The medieval empire stretched from the Atlantic Ocean to the Niger River.\n\nSundiata Keita was a Malinke prince, whose name means 'lion prince', who waged war against the kingdom of Sosso from the 1230s. The name Sundiata gave to his empire, Africa's largest up to that point, was Mali, meaning 'the place where the king lives'.\n\nThe Mali Empire prospered thanks to trade and its prime location, situated between the rain forests of southern West Africa and the powerful Muslim caliphates of North Africa.\n\nThe Mali Empire consisted of outlying areas and small kingdoms. All these Kingdoms pledged allegiance to Mali by offering annual tributes in the form of rice, millet, lances and arrows. Mali prospered from taxes collected from its citizens, and all goods brought in and out of the Empire were heavily taxed while all gold nuggets belonged to the King. However, gold dust could be traded and at certain times gold dust was used as currency together with salt and cotton cloth. Cowrie shells from the Indian Ocean were later used as currency in the internal trade of Western Sahara.\n\nThe Mali Empire would reach a height of strength during the reign of Mansa Musa I. Territorial expansion coincided with cultural advancements, particularly in architecture, and the empire flourished. Using his large army, Musa doubled the empire’s territory.\n\nThe reign of Mansa Musa I (1312-1337) saw staggering wealth brought through Mali's control of regional trade routes, its second golden era.\n\nMali, which included the city of Timbuktu, became known as an important center of knowledge. The empire developed into a hub for the Islamic faith before the empire’s ultimate decline in power and influence.\n\nRight behind the Songhai Empire, which would conquer most of the kingdom by the late 15th century, ancient Mali was one of the largest states in pre-modern African history. The empire lasted from c. 1230 to 1600.\n\nIt was the largest empire in West Africa and profoundly influenced the culture of the region through the spread of its language, laws, and customs along lands adjacent to the Niger River, as well as other areas consisting of numerous vassal kingdoms and provinces.\n\nThe Mali Empire flourished as a result of trade. It contained three immense gold mines within its borders, and the empire taxed every ounce of gold or salt that entered and exited.\n\n---\n\nAbout the Author: Lawrence Jean-Louis is the founder of eBrand Me, a digital marketing agency offering marketing & consultative services to CPAs and tax professionals.
