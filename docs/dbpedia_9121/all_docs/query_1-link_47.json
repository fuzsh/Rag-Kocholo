        "text": "Parallel management systems\n\nThe fall of the Macina Empire in 1864 in the wake of local uprisings against it was followed by a colonial administration that managed the region until 1960. The French divided the region into thirty-five cantons and appointed chiefs of cantons which were subordinated to the chiefs of subdivisions (Macina, TÃ©nenkou, Mopti and DjennÃ©), who were in turn subject to the decisions of the chiefs of cercles at the time (Issa Ber, Mopti and Macina). Only the chiefs of cantons, the lowest rank, were locals.\n\nAs a general rule, the colonial administration accepted the indigenous management of natural resources, namely, the Dina, but undermined its ability to enforce access to rights and to administer local resources based on the needs of various production systems. For instance, the colonial power was convinced that some of the lands that were used only seasonally were underexploited. In 1904, this assumption led to the transfer of ownership of unoccupied lands to the state (via nationalisation) and later to their allocation as private property. TheÂ colonial administration also imposed itself as an external actor managing and distributing access to natural resources in the Delta. For the first time, the Delta was no longer managed by a political and economic structure based on the interests of local populations and their customs. Instead, an outsider entity began governing both access and use of naturalÂ resources.\n\nThis marked the outset of two parallel forms of land tenure, whose existence feeds directly into the insecurity of tenure that characterises Mopti today. Customary chiefs could only manage the lands under continuous production; the colonial administration was charged with the management of unoccupied lands and was allowed to grant private property titles. Other resources such as water and forests were simply taken off from the jurisdiction of customary systems and placed under the control of the Water and Forests Agency, the predecessor of what is nowadays called the National Direction of Water and Forests (DirectionÂ NationaleÂ desÂ EauxÂ etÂ ForÃªts).\n\nMost local populations remained largely ignorant of this dual system and of the legal provisions adopted by the French administration â as they remain about land tenure legislation today. However, some of those who did know did not shy away from exploiting the new system to gain advantageous access to resources. The creation of local interest groups intent on exploiting the French administration for preferential access to productive resources denied to them under the customary system (especially for settlement), continuously undermining the traditional management of natural resources. Rather than addressing the exclusionary practices of the Dina, the colonial and postcolonial rearrangement of resource management continued these practices.\n\nIn postcolonial Mali under the presidency of Modibo KeÃ¯ta (1960â1968), customary systems underwent further alterations and saw their power diminish even more, moving into the hands of state authorities. The cantonment chiefdoms were abolished because they were perceived as supporters of the opposition party. The administrative division of the region was rearranged and following a governmental policy all administrators were recruited from outside the Mopti region. The role of the administration was to maintain social order and arbitrate disputes through the chieftaincies, who were likewise charged with tax collection. InÂ spite of this proliferation of authorities, little clarity was established as to what exactly each authority was responsible for.\n\nThe most emblematic example is that of the Water and Forests Agency, which enjoyed power to arrest, confiscate and impose sanctions on local populations, as well as to influence the distribution of natural resources. Seasonal visitors to the Delta could now request access to natural resources from traditional chiefs, the administration (e.g., governor) and its technical service (Water and Forests Agency) â that had competing interests. Finally, in 1986 all customary land tenure rights were abolished and property was transferred to the state. Customary property rights were converted to rights of use of the land âonly for as long as the state has no need of itâ. According to the most updated legislation, unclaimed land belongs to the state, but customary property rights are recognised if ratified by formal authorities.\n\nThe state added competing and overlapping institutions, which, instead of creating links with the local knowledge of production systems, challenged and undermined it. Production systems are currently faced with a governance characterised by âstructural chaosâ. ThereÂ isÂ aÂ vast array of state institutions that local communities cannot rely on and that compete in allocating natural resources, generating more tenure insecurity. A case in point is the use of formal justice in the management of natural resources that often led to inapplicable and unsustainable decisions that in turn were conducive to local conflict. ForÂ instance, judges attributed property rights to outsiders from different cercles, even different regions of the country, which contravenes customary norms. This solidified in the reattribution of land to members of a certain community by traditional chiefs while an outsider held theÂ propertyÂ title.\n\nMore generally, local populations did not trust judges to solve their disputes because the judges did not understand local dynamics and their verdicts tended to favour the richer party and sedentary groups. Discrimination against pastoralists was mentioned by a number of interviewees. In particular, one explained that âthe formal justice has brutalised and abused the Fulani pastoralists for too longâ and that âinjustice never ends against themâ. In addition, formal justice often struggled to fulfil its mandate. It lacked resources â mostly qualified personnel â and collaboration with the police was not always smooth. Often the statements collected by the police were poorly redacted and lacked basic information. Judiciary proceedings were also perceived as being too long: some of the cases brought before judges needed immediate solutions to ensure the continuity of activities of various production groups, for example the permit to start the seasonal movement of herds.\n\nIn retrospect, nationalisation has deprived local communities of their customary jurisdiction over communal resources. Nowadays, a legal framework applies to the entire country without accounting for local contingencies, and conventions regulate the management of natural resources. In Mopti, the new laws cut across customary frontiers established by the Dina and made outsiders with little knowledge of local production systems responsible for administering regional wealth. This is not to say that state legislation should be regarded as intentionally inimical towards local communities and their working systems. But the way in which it was implemented in Mopti was incoherent and conducive to marginalisation, subverting customary management of natural resources without putting in place a sustainable alternative or complementary system to the satisfaction of local constituencies. Even when moves to support traditional arrangements were made, they never resulted in actionable plans or the devolution of power.\n\nChallenges to traditional justice as resource management\n\nThe legacy of the Dina empire is still visible in the Mopti region. Indeed, the implementation of Dina norms is perhaps the most unifying factor across production systems and ethnic groups today. Customary chiefs play a prominent role in solving disputes based on Dina principles, especially given the overwhelming absence of the formal justice system and peopleâs mistrust towards the judiciary. Customary leaders are commonly perceived as part of society, not as external actors seeking to impose a different order on the community and its resources. Within all administration systems that succeeded the Dina in Mopti, traditional chiefs were the only constant authority figure and the only one stemming directly from the community. These authorities thus derive legitimacy from their proximity to the disputants, physically and culturally, who view them as âpillars of the societyâ, and as the only ones who can maintain the social fabric of central Mali. At the same time, however, these traditional authorities face an erosion of their legitimacy and their ability to adjudicate resource conflicts.\n\nStructural impediments\n\nThe decentralisation process that started in 1992 could have been a positive turning point for the better management of natural resources. In this process, the state sought to formalise the ties between formal local authorities and traditional ones, for instance, by formally appointing chiefs. Most important, customary authorities are invested by law with reconciliation in civil and commercial matters. Many customary chiefs objected to how decentralisation unfolded. First, they did not appreciate that in the decentralised hierarchy of governance they were subject to the authority of the mayors, mainly because traditional authorities were only granted a consultative voice. In their view, this limits their role and subjugates their decisions to the executive power of mayors who are bound to consult chiefs, but not to implement any of their suggestions. Formal authorities agreed in interviews that the more the state apparatus evolved, the less important traditional authorities became.\n\nThe roles that chiefs were granted were crafted in such a way that the impact of their decisions could not go beyond their village and could only be implemented with the consent of state authorities, that is, mayors. This limited their ability to generate legitimacy and social capital via leveraging their social embeddedness. Additionally, in certain cases, the multiparty system that results in partisan allegiances in the communal council prevented chiefs from being asked for advice. Often mayors of municipalities (communes) that encompass several villages invite for consultations only the chiefs who either belong to the same political party or have views that align with their own. As a consequence, âchiefs have a very important role on paper. But in reality, they are not even consultedâ.\n\nAnother dissatisfaction stems from the selective implementation of the renowned 2006 lawÂ relating to the creation and administration of villages, fractions and districts. Given the multitude of tasks allocated by the state to these traditional authorities, the law legislated that chiefs and their councillors were entitled to financial compensation and reimbursement of travel expenses. Most of the chiefs and councillors interviewed never received either. Most municipalities justify the lack of enforcement by pointing to their depleted treasuries, but to the chiefs this is the umpteenth proof of the stateâs unwillingness to genuinely insert chieftaincies within the local power structures and acknowledge their role in local governance.\n\nIn practice, and even though each village, fraction or neighbourhood is administered by a chief assisted by a council, the precise status of chieftains is still unclear. Even when laws grant responsibilities to chiefs, they are hardly put in the position of fulfilling them. AlthoughÂ the selection and nomination of the chiefs is to be carried out based on local traditions, a local representative of the state has to ratify the nomination within thirty working days. ThisÂ process is particularly consequential given that, by law, village chiefs have a consultative voice in the communal council and need a formal recognition to be able to exercise their duty. The vast majority of chiefs â up to 70 per cent â did not receive formal recognition by the state as required by Malian law.\n\nThe nominations process has also been challenged in recent years. According to tradition, the chieftaincy is passed from father to son. If the son is too young, authority should be passed on to the next closest male relative. If no one meets the standards, sometimes the state administration organises elections, challenging centuries-old traditions of succession. Such new protocols are harmful and fall short because they are self-centred and remote from the normative values in which local populations recognise themselves.\n\nCorruption and misgovernance\n\nThe involvement of chiefs in the political arena â often expressed by allegiance to certain parties â and corruption are two of the main circumstances delegitimising customary authorities today. According to a Malian expert, customary chiefs are related by family ties to the mayors and state authorities in at least 60 per cent of the 703 communes of the country. This number is a personal estimate, but every chief interviewed affirmed that they were either closely related to the mayors in their villages or towns or had occupied both positions at the same time at a certain point. Village chiefs started running for mayorsâ seats in the aftermath of decentralisation. More of a preservation strategy than a political agenda, this practice evolved into the concentration of power in the hands of few, which in turn consolidated patronage systems that, when proved disadvantageous for local communities, become harder to break and to challenge.\n\nLocal chieftains are deeply involved in politics and often members of political parties. Whereas in principle no one should be banned from expressing their political preferences in public, this situation creates a legitimacy problem. Believed to be super partes authorities, the inclination towards a specific political agenda undermines their impartiality. People fear that they might make decisions either in favour of villagers who are members of their political party or in line with partisan choices. People are also under the impression that chiefs sometimes collude with formal authorities in the settlement of disputes. For instance, according to local users of customary systems, in certain cases traditional authorities have agreed with the gendarmerie on a fine they have then shared between themselves.\n\nAdditionally, the proximity of the customary figures to political parties may play a role in their decisions to attribute communal resources such as land to people outside the community. The main external contenders to land in the centre of Mali are private investors and the bourgeoisie bamakoise, the new rich from Bamako. Most of the outsiders who seek property titles in Mopti are farmers, thus limiting the amount of pasture available for pastoralists. But agriculturalists are affected as well. Some complain that the best parcels of land are sold to investors, with or without the consent of the chiefs, and that the customary norms are overridden in these transactions. Newcomers to a community do not owe allegiance to local chiefs or to customs that apply there. Because customary norms that dictate use of land are applicable to and known only by the local community, an outsiderâs use of communal resources cannot be administered by local chieftaincies.\n\nFurthermore, if they are not directly involved in the decision to sell land to outsiders, customary authorities are also frequently bypassed during the processes of subdividing and selling land, even though the law requires their consultation. They are also not informed of such transactions carried out by formal authorities, which increases the risk of mismanagement of local resources (by way of reattribution) and consequent conflict. ThisÂ has already resulted in pitiless competition over natural resources and conflicts that often escalated into communal violence.\n\nRent-seeking behaviour\n\nAnother delegitimising element is the rent-seeking behaviour of certain customary figures, among which the dioros, the landlords of the bourgou. The bourgoutiÃ¨res, the zones where this fodder grows, are particularly important for the pastoralist production system, which was prioritised in these zones under the Dina. Second in line were the Bozo, who could use it to establish a basis for their fishing activities in the Delta. Finally, agriculturalists (mainly rimaibes, the slaves of the Fulani) cultivated these lands and harvested them before the return of the pastoralists. However, the bourgoutiÃ¨res came under remarkable pressure as society became more sedentary and harvesting increasingly important relative to grazing. Moreover, the overlapping and contradicting management systems created tensions and conflicts with regards to ownership and use.\n\nTo date, a good portion of the bourgoutiÃ¨res in the rural areas are managed by the dioros, just as they were in the time of SÃ©kou Amadou. However, permission to graze in a bourgoutier has become conditional on paying a fee. The fee used to have the symbolic function of acknowledgement of local dioros and their authority by outsiders. In exchange, the dioros used this as a monitoring system to ensure that they knew who entered the area and that no one was seeking illicit appropriation. However, current amounts go far beyond the symbolic value and vary mainly based on the number of heads in the herd and on the zone. InÂ certain areas in the north of Mopti, the dioros used to demand up to five million CFA (about 7700 euro) to access their bourgoutiÃ¨res. In other zones, they demanded one million CFA for every hundred animals, even if they did not have enough pasture for them. Estimates from previous studies in the area indicate that annual profits from bourgou fields vary from USD 170 per hectare under rudimentary management to USD 750 per hectare under intense management.\n\nThis rent-seeking behaviour pushed many pastoralists to fraudolently enter the bourgoutier, which led to the dioros having them sanctioned by the gendarmerie. Dioros were also accused of complicity with formal authorities, including the justice system. However, being brought before the formal institutions of the state is perceived as humiliating by the Fulani community and the population living in the rural areas. As one interviewee emphatically explained, âif you bring me to the police for a dispute and I am married to your sister, I will divorce her and never speak to you againâ.\n\nWhen formal justice is sidelined, it is often because its legal framework fails to provide âan answer to the psychological and cultural expectations governing the confidence of litigants and the (formal) lawâ. This is also symptomatic of a justice system that is remote from its users both physically and (most importantly) psychologically. Thus, the rent-seeking behaviour of the dioros and their collaboration with formal institutions who have historically mistreated local populations, was perceived as one of the gravest forms of social injustice.\n\nLack of enforcement and a complementary justice system\n\nOne final factor undermining the legitimacy of customary authorities and their ability to mediate resource conflicts is that they have no enforcement power. Indeed, the resurgence of resource conflicts in Mopti is symptomatic of precisely this lack and of the grave absence of justice that should accompany reconciliation. Although disputants might personally share the decisions of customary authorities, they cannot be legally or in any other way compelled to implement them.\n\nThe only enforcement mechanism available to customary authorities is to cultivate a goodÂ reputation and maintain constructive relations with the community. Often the act of abiding by customary decisions is driven by communal social expectation and fear of socialÂ sanctioning â for example, individuals can be excluded from social events, like marriages and baptisms. AlthoughÂ this does not resolve all commitment problems, having customary authorities able to impose visible social costs on perpetrators helps the âhand-tyingâ and enforcement. However, this contrepoids system characteristic of traditional arrangements, however, has eroded and lost its power over time.\n\nMoreover, the disputes are not mediated at the level of socio-professional groups that compete for natural resources and do not ensure the buy-in of all competing parties. Usually,Â disputes are handled on an individual basis and the chiefs take into account the particular episode that triggered the dispute, but not always the entire history of conflict in that particular community or related to that specific resource. The reconciliation is also between the disputants only, not between the local socio-professional groups they are a part of and a justice process does not accompany it. Such conflicts thus continue to arise.\n\nThe lack of enforceability of their decisions had pushed those wealthy enough to afford the costs of the formal justice to seek redress before the judiciary. But, as mentioned, this contributed to the further degradation of communal relations, rather than to just outcomes. âFormal justice only speaks the truth when one paysâ, âthe independence of the judiciary means the absolute lack of control over justiceâ, âjudicial power equals economic power which equals corruptionâ, and âformal justice is just another name for repressionâ are some of the impressions that interviewees expressed."
