However, this river, and its principal tributaries are, in their natural state, capricious rivers. In the early 1950s, the World Bank began assisting the Thai government in a series of projects designed to break this ancient tyranny of the rivers’ violent changes. The paper describes how the river is being tamed for irrigation and navigation, and how they are providing electric power and other benefits.\n\nAfter becoming independent, a number of African countries experienced serious economic difficulties. This article, one in a series on stabilization, describes the uniqueness of the problems faced by a particular country at a particular time, but it also indicates some of the difficulties that are common to the developing countries as a whole, and some of the measures for overcoming them.\n\nManfred Reichardt\n\nTHE REPUBLIC OF MALI, independent since 1960, is a landlocked country in West Africa which in the north extends well into the Sahara desert. It covers an area about twice the size of France, but its limited resources and the geographical isolation provide one of the least promising natural settings for economic development for its 4.6 million inhabitants; Mali’s gross domestic product per capita is among the lowest in the world. The economic activity is mainly concentrated along the rivers Senegal and Niger, the principal economic arteries of the country, and is based on subsistence agriculture. Mali’s main source of income has traditionally been the export of cattle and groundnuts; cotton is a vigorous newcomer. There are no known mineral resources of commercial significance except some rock salt which covers part of the country’s own needs."
