Special thanks to Barbara Brown, coordinator at the African Studies Center, Boston University, and all the speakers at the summer/fall 2001 African History Institute. Credit goes to the Teachers Curriculum Institute for their curriculum unit Empires and Kingdoms of Sub-Saharan Africa, from which I excerpted two lessons.[1] Special credit also goes to the authors of the three versions of the Sundiata epic that provides both inspiration and a focus for this unit. Special acknowledgement goes to Carol Bearse, Curriculum Coordinator for the ESL/Bilingual Program at Fuller Middle School, Framingham, MA, for her essential contributions to the lessons on Sundiata and honoring our ancestors. Thanks also to Lenna Dower, Milton Academy, for sharing her unit on Sundiata. See the Teacher Resources in the appendix for additional sources.\n\nIntroduction\n\nAncient West Africa: An Introduction, designed for the middle grades (6 – 8), uses a humanities approach. The three areas of focus are physical geography, the gold trade of ancient West Africa, and the epic of Sundiata of Mali. The unit applies the Five Themes of Geography throughout. Strategies for students with special needs and students acquiring English are also applied.[2]\n\nPurpose\n\nThe primary purpose of this unit is to introduce students to West African culture and history. Within this objective, the unit also hopes to:\n\nEnrich, complicate, and humanize students’ understandings and perceptions of Africa;\n\nFocus on West Africa, (in anticipation of a subsequent unit on slavery in the U.S.), expanding students’ perceptions of Africans beyond the narrow scope of the Atlantic slave trade; and,\n\nDispel misconceptions and assumptions about Africans as “simple” or “uncivilized” peoples.\n\nCurriculum Context\n\nPrior to this unit, students will have studied the dawn of humans in Africa; Ancient Egypt; and ancient empires that extended into Africa (including empires of Greece, Alexander the Great, Phoenicia, and Rome).\n\nAfter this unit, students will study U.S. history beginning with the thirteen colonies, including the Atlantic slave trade and influences of West African culture on the Americas.\n\nObjectives for Student Learning\n\nDuring this unit, students will:\n\napply the Five Themes of Geography (location, regions, human-environment interaction, movement, and place) to study Africa\n\nunderstand that Africa is vast\n\nappreciate that Africa is diverse, geographically, linguistically, culturally, and economically\n\nrecognize that we cannot learn all of Africa in this mini-unit (as a result of being vast and diverse across space and over time)\n\nlearn simple physical geography of Africa and some implications for human-environmental interaction\n\nbe able to describe the Ancient West African gold trade\n\nsynthesize aspects of the culture, religions, politics, and history of ancient Mali from studying the epic tale of Sundiata\n\napply their understanding of the African tradition of honoring ancestors by creating “Honoring My Ancestors” projects\n\nOutline of the Unit\n\nLesson 1 Activating & Assessing Prior Knowledge Lesson 2 Review the Five Themes of Geography Lesson 3 Introduction to African Maps (Location, Place) Lesson 4 Physical Geography of Africa & Human Adaptations to the Environment (Location, Regions, Human-Environment Interaction) Lesson 5 Caravans of Gold video (Movement) Lesson 6 Honoring the Ancestors: The Kingdom of Ancient Mali & the Sundiata Epic (Place) Lesson 7 Student Projects “Honoring Our Ancestors”\n\nLesson 1: Activating & Assessing Prior Knowledge\n\n(Approximately 30-60 minutes)\n\nMaterials: Graphic organizers (word-splash web, Before & After Reading, and pre-unit vocabulary assessment)\n\nPurpose: To activate and assess prior knowledge and identify misconceptions.\n\nProcedure: Students will complete the graphic organizers. Use the organizers for class discussion and to activate inquiry questions. If appropriate, use student responses to modify lessons. Retain the organizers to compare understands at the completion of the unit.\n\nLesson 2: Review of 5 Geography Themes\n\n(Approximately 30-45 minutes)\n\nMaterials: Handout “100+ Generic Geography Questions;\n\nPurpose: To review the 5 themes of geography so that students may apply them in the Africa unit.\n\nProcedure: Review the 5 themes, briefly defined below. Use the handout for students to practice with topics familiar to them, such as their home, school, and town.\n\nBrief Definitions: 5 Geography Themes[3]\n\nLocation: The location theme helps answer the question “Where is it?”\n\nPlace: The theme of place answers the question “What is the place like?” Places can be described by their physical characteristics such as climate, mountains, deserts, bodies of water, plants, and animals. Places can also be described by their human characteristics, such as many people live in a place, what language they speak, and what they do for a living.\n\nHuman-Environmental Interaction: The theme of human-environmental interaction deals with how people use, adapt to, or change their environment.\n\nMovement: The theme of movement looks at how people, objects, and ideas are linked to places through movement.\n\nRegions: The theme of regions looks at places divided and defined by physical or human characteristics or categories.\n\nLesson 3: Introduction to African Maps\n\n(Approximately ½ hour)\n\nMaterials:\n\nSlide projector\n\nOverhead projector\n\nMap: How Big is Africa?\n\nPolitical map of modern Africa\n\n“Messy Map” of African language groups\n\nMap of ancient Africa (from African Beginnings)\n\nMap of physical features of Africa (TCI slide CP.B)\n\nPurpose: To introduce Africa as a huge and diverse subject that we cannot fully study and understand in this unit.\n\nGeography Themes: Location & Place.\n\nProcedure: Students will briefly examine a series of maps of Africa to appreciate the following:\n\nAfrica is huge\n\nModern Africa has 54 nations\n\nAfrica has thousands of languages and many ethnic and culture groups\n\nHuman history in Africa spans millions of years – from the dawn of humans through ancient civilizations to the present\n\nThe physical geography of Africa is diverse, therefore people’s lives vary as they adapt to their environment\n\nLesson 4: Physical Geography of Africa & Human Adaptations to the Environment\n\n(Approximately 1 ½ – 2 hours)\n\nMaterials:\n\nSlide projector\n\nOverhead projector\n\nTCI Slides (1.1E, 1.1D, 1.1Q, CP.B, 1.2B, 1.2C, 1.1A, 1.2H)\n\nTCI Handouts (map: Student Handout 1.1A – modified; Student Handouts 1.2A – one for each zone; checklist for labeling map)\n\nTCI Teacher Guides to Slides 1.1 and 1.2 (modified)\n\nColor markers, pencils, or crayons\n\nTeacher master of completed map\n\nNotes on Human-Environment Interaction\n\nPurpose: To introduce students to simple physical geography of the African continent and some examples of how Africans adapted to their diverse environments.\n\nPrimary Geography Themes: Regions & Human-Environment Interaction\n\nProcedure: Follow the procedures outlined below.\n\nPart I Major African Water Bodies\n\nGive each student a map outline of Africa (TCI Student Handout 1.1A -modified) and Checklist for Labeling Map\n\nUse the TCI Teacher Guide to Slides 1.1 to narrate the slides & guide class discussion.\n\nStudents will locate, draw, and color major water bodies onto their maps using the Checklist Students will check their work against teacher master on transparency.\n\nPart II Four Major Regions/Zones of Physical Geography\n\nShow TCI Slide CP.B of African physical geography zones (in color)- four major geographic zones: tropical rainforest, savanna, semi-arid, and desert.\n\nUse Teacher Narrative: Introduction to Zones of Physical Geography to introduce the unifying theme of water for the zones and human-environment interaction.\n\nPass out Student Handouts TCI 1.2A (one for each zone). Students will read and study these handouts to draw, in pencil, each zone onto their outline maps of Africa. After checking their work against teacher master, students will color the zones and complete the key.

This will allow students to apply their understandings from this unit to their own lives. The individual projects will serve as assessments of learning.\n\nProcedure:\n\nTeacher will model examples of each possible project format: poem, family artifact with oral or written story, family story (oral or written), illustration of family tree.\n\nReview the criteria chart for the project requirements and assessment.\n\nStudents will select one format and begin brainstorming/researching/drafting.\n\nStudents will complete their projects as homework.\n\nStudents will share projects in class.\n\nTeacher Narrative: Introduction to Zones of Physical Geography\n\nWater is a defining factor for life in Africa. Find the equator on your map of Africa. Along the equator is a force called the “tropical convergence zone” where the interplay between the physical geography and the atmospheric conditions mean lots of turbulence, which means RAIN! Lots of RAIN! Rain all year long. The “tropical convergence zone” bounces up and down like a yo-yo, sometimes moving north, sometimes moving south. So people move to follow the yo-yo effect – wanting to use the rain to their advantage for living, following wild game animals, growing crops, or raising livestock animals.\n\nIn the African climate, the most significant factor is rainfall. Along the equator, rain all the time. In the rest of Africa, rain is seasonal; winter is the dry season, summer is the rainy season. Remember the four zones: tropical rainforest (most rain, along equator), savanna (both sides, north and south of the rainforest), the semiarid (between the savanna and the desert), and the deserts.\n\nAccess to water, rain or water bodies, deeply affected the lives of Africans. For example, in the tropical rainforest, the tsetse fly killed domesticated animals like horses and cattle, so armies based on cavalry and cattle farmers could not exist in the tropical zones. Also, in the tropical zones, diseases like malaria kill many people, though the Africans found herbal/plant medicines to help heal malaria.\n\nTeacher Narrative Introducing “Caravans of Gold” Video\n\nMovement is an important geography theme. Movement includes the movement of people, goods, and ideas.\n\nIn ancient Africa, river and sea systems were critical to ancient African trade and cultural exchanges within Africa as well as with cultures in Europe, Arabia, India, and as far away as China. For example, along the Indian Ocean, monsoon winds carried trade boats south along the east coast of Africa from November to March, and north from April to October. The Red Sea and the Nile River connected Africa and the world around the Mediterranean Sea.\n\nHowever, don’t think of the Saharan Desert as a barrier to trade and cultural exchange! The Sahara used to be wetter. Ancient Saharan desert cave drawings show that the desert used to be an area with more water.\n\nFor thousands of years, the Berber people of northwest Africa crossed the Sahara to trade and for cultural exchanges. Then, in approximately AD 300, the Romans brought an important technology to the Sahara. Any idea what? The camel! Romans needed African grain to feed the Empire.\n\nThe Berber people, who had been crossing the Sahara for hundreds of years before the Romans came, creatively adapted the camel to the Sahara to make trade easier. A major part of the trade across the Sahara was for gold and salt. Salt was so valuable, it was used as money in trade.\n\nSocial Studies\n\nMs. van Gigch\n\nName ______________________\n\nSection _____________________\n\nDate _______________________\n\nChecklist for Labeling Physical Geography of Africa\n\nMajor African Water Bodies:\n\nCheck off when you have located, drawn, and labeled the following:\n\n____ Nile River\n\n____ Lake Victoria\n\n____ Mediterranean Sea\n\n____ Atlantic Ocean\n\n____ Indian Ocean\n\n____ Red Sea\n\n____ Niger River\n\n____ Congo River\n\nFour Major Physical Geography Regions/Zones:\n\nCheck off when you have drawn & colored the zones and key:\n\n____ Tropical Rainforest\n\n____ Savanna/Grasslands\n\n____ Semiarid (northern strip of semiarid is called The Sahel)\n\n____ Deserts\n\n____ color-code your key\n\nTeachers’ Resources & Works Cited\n\nResources:\n\nAfrican Studies Center, Boston University, Boston, MA (to borrow materials and receive training)\n\nCurricula:\n\nTeachers’ Curriculum Institute.

the Great…” (page 2)\n\nGriot: “Listen to the story of the son of the Buffalo, the son of the lion… Maghan Sundiata… the man of many names against whom sorcery could avail nothing.” (page 2)\n\nScene 2: The Buffalo Woman\n\nGriot: A hunter, who is also a seer, does a twelve cowrie shell divination for King Maghan Kon Fatta, that he may see the future. (page 5)\n\nHunter 1: “…Fine king, your successor is not yet born. I see two hunters coming to your city… a woman accompanies them. Oh, that woman! She is ugly, she is hideous, she bears on her back a disfiguring hump. Her monstrous eyes… but mystery of mysteries, this is the woman you must marry, sire, for she will be the mother of him who will make the name of Mali immortal forever…” (page 5-6)\n\nGriot: Later, two strangers, hunters, arrived at the king’s city with a woman. The hunters tell the story of their adventure. (page 6)\n\nHunter 2: “… After the great harvest my brother and I left our village to hunt… we learned that an amazing buffalo was ravaging the countryside… the King [of Do] had promised the finest rewards to the hunters who killed the buffalo. We decided to try our luck… [when] we saw an old woman… who was weeping, … gnawed by hunger… Touched by her tears I approached and took some pieces of dried meat from my hunter’s bag…” (page 7)\n\nBuffalo Woman: “…arrows are useless against the buffalo; but, young hunter, your heart is generous and it is you who will be the buffalo’s vanquisher. I am the buffalo you are looking for, and your generosity has vanquished me.” (page 7-8)\n\nGriot: And so the buffalo woman transformed herself into the young hunchback woman named Sogolon and traveled with the hunters to King Maghan Fatta, who married her to complete the destiny told in the 12 cowrie shell divination. (page 8-9)\n\nScene 3: The Lion Child\n\nGriot: Sogolon became pregnant. When “Sogolon’s time came… Thunder began to rumble and swift lightening rent the clouds…the king’s griot sings…’I salute you Maghan Kon Fatta… the lion child, the buffalo child is born’” … The name was given on the eighth day after his birth.” His name was Sogolon Mari Djata. (pages 12 – 14)\n\nScene 4: Childhood\n\nGriot: By the age of 3, Sogolon Mari Djata, as everyone called him, could still not walk or talk. (page 15)\n\nSassouma: Sogolon, see my eleven year old son! “I prefer a son who walks on his two legs to a lion that crawls on the ground.” (page 16)\n\nGriot: At age 7, Mari Djata still crawled. The King speaks to his advisors. (page 17)\n\nKing’s advisors: “When the seed germinates growth is not always easy; great trees grow slowly but they plunge their roots deep into the ground.” (page 17)\n\nKing: Mari Djata, I am growing old…but before death takes me off I am going to give you the present which each king gives his successor… In Mali, every prince has his own griot…Doua is mine and the son of Doua, Balla Fasseke here, will be your griot. Be inseparable friends from this day forward. From his mouth you will hear the history of your ancestors, you will learn the art of governing Mali… May you destiny be accomplished, but never forget that Niani is your capital and Mali the cradle of your ancestors.” (page 17)\n\nScene 5: The Lion’s Awakening\n\nGriot: One day Sassouma Berete was especially mean to Sogolon, laughing at Sogolon and her son who still couldn’t walk at seven. (page 19)\n\nSundiata: “Very well then, I am going to walk today… Go and tell my father’s smiths to make me the heaviest possible iron rod.” (page 19)\n\nGriot: Balla Fasseke ran to the master smith to order an iron rod. “[Mari Djata] crept on all-fours… to the iron bar… he picked up the iron bar without any effort and stood it up vertically… With a violent jerk he threw his weight on to it…In a great effort he straightened up and was on his feet at one go – but the great bar of iron was twisted and had taken the form of a bow!… Sogolon Djata walked.” (pages 19-22)\n\nSassouma: (speaking to herself) I will call the nine great witches of Mali and make a plan to kill Sundiata. I must protect the throne for my son. (page 24)\n\nGriot: The next night, Sundiata went to check his mother’s vegetable patch and found the nine witches stealing leaves and pretending to run away like thieves. (page 25)\n\nSundiata: “Stop, stop, poor old women…What is the matter with you to run away like this. This garden belongs to all…Each time you run short of condiments come to stock up here without fear.” (page 25)\n\nWitches: “Listen, Djata…we had come here to test you. We have no need of your condiments… We were sent here by the queen mother to provoke you… But nothing can be done against a heart full of kindness… Forgive us, son of Sogolon.” (page 26)\n\nScene 6: Exile\n\nSogolon: “Let us leave here, my son… You will return to reign when you are a man; for\n\nit is in Mali that your destiny must be fulfilled.” (page 27)\n\nGriot: “One morning the king [Sassouma’s son] announced his intentions of sending an embassy to the powerful king of Sosso… For such a delicate mission he thought of Balla Fasseke… It was a very clever way of taking away from Sundiata the griot his father had given him.” (page 27)\n\nKing of Mema: (speaking to Sundiata) “It is destiny that has sent you to Mema. I will make a great warrior out of you.” (page 37)\n\nGriot: “After three years the king [of Mema] appointed Sundiata… his viceroy, and in the king’s absence it was he who governed. Djata had now seen eighteen winters and at that time he was a tall young man with a fat neck and powerful chest… The soothsayers of Mema revealed the extraordinary destiny of Djata. It was said that he was the successor of Alexander the Great and that he would be even greater.” (page 37)\n\nScene 7: The Battle at Kirina\n\nGriot: While Sogolon’s son was fighting his first campaign far from his native land, Mali had fallen under the domination of a new master, Soumaoro (also known as Sumanguru), King of Sosso. (page 38)\n\nTraveler: “Maghan Sundiata, I salute you; king of Mali, the throne of your fathers awaits you. Whatever rank you may hold here, leave all these honours and come and deliver your fatherland. The brave await you, come and restore rightful authority to Mali. Weeping mothers pray only in your name, the assembled kings await you, for your name alone inspires confidence in them. Son of Sogolon, your time has come… for you are the giant who will crush the giant Soumaoro.” (page 45)\n\nGriot: “Up until that time, Sundiata and Soumaoro had fought each other without a declaration of war. One does not wage war without saying why it is waged… Here is the dialogue of the sorcerer kings:” (pages 59-60)\n\nSoumaoro: “Stop, young man. Henceforth I am the king of Mali. If you want peace, return to where you came from.”\n\nSundiata: I am coming back, Soumaoro, to recapture my kingdom. If you want peace you will make amends to my allies and return to Sosso where you are the king.\n\nSoumaoro: I am king of Mali by force of arms. My rights have been established by conquest.\n\nSundiata: Then I will take Mali from you by force of arms and chase you from my kingdom.\n\nSoumaoro: Know, then, that I am the wild yam of the rocks; nothing will make me leave Mali.\n\nSundiata: Know, also that I have in my camp seven master smiths who will shatter the rocks. Then, yam, I will eat you.\n\nSoumaoro: I am the poisonous mushroom that makes the fearless vomit.\n\nSundiata: As for me, I am the ravenous [rooster], the poison does not matter to me.\n\nSoumaoror: Behave yourself, little boy, or you will burn your foot, for I am the red-hot cinder.\n\nSundiata: But me, I am the rain that extinguishes the cinder; I am the boisterous torrent that will carry you off.\n\nSoumaoro: I am the might silk-cotton tree that looks from on high on the tops of other trees.\n\nSundiata: And I, I am the strangling creeper that climbs to the top of the forest giant.\n\nSoumaoro: Enough of this argument. You shall not have Mali.\n\nSundiata: Know that there is not room for two kings on the same skin, Soumaoro; you will let me have your place.\n\nSoumaoro: Very well, since you want war I will wage war against you, but I would have you know that I have killed nine kings whose heads adorn my room. What a pity, indeed, that your head should take its place beside those of your fellow madcaps.\n\nSundiata: Prepare yourself, Soumaoro, for it will be long before the calamity that is going to crash down upon you and yours comes to an end.\n\nGriot: After the war of mouths, swords had to decide the issue. (pages 60-61) “It was announced to Sundiata that his sister Nana Triban and Balla Fasseke, having escaped from Sosso, had now arrived.” (page 56)\n\nNana Triban: Hail, my brother.\n\nSundiata: Greetings, sister.\n\nBalla Fasseke: Hail Sundiata.\n\nSundiata: Greetings, my griot.\n\nNana Triban: (wiping away tears) When you left Mali, my brother [Sassouma’s son] sent me by force to Sosso to be the wife of Soumaoro…I was in constant touch with Balla Fasseke, each of us wanting to pierce the mystery of Soumaoro’s magic power. One night I … said to Soumaoro…Tell me, king of kings, tell me what jinn [magic spirit] protects you… he himself boasted to me of the might of his Tana. That very night he took me into his magic chamber and told me all. [A tana is a hereditary taboo. In the case of Soumaoro, he was forbidden to touch a rooster’s spur so he could concentrate in himself the power of his ancestors. If he touched the rooster’s spur and broke his taboo, his ancestors would withdraw their power and Soumaoro would lose his power.] (pages 57 – 58, 93 – 94)\n\nGriot: In the battle at Kirina, “Sogolon’s son looked for Soumaoro… The king of Sosso, who did not want Sundiata near him, retreated far behind his men, but Sundiata followed him with his eyes. He stopped and bent his bow. The arrow flew and grazed Soumaoro on the shoulder. The [rooster’s] spur no more than scratched him, but the effect was immediate and Soumaoro felt his powers leave him… A great black bird flew over… the bird of Kirina… The king of Sosso let out a great cry and, turning his horse’s head, he took flight.” (page 65)\n\nScene 8: The Lion King Returns to Mali\n\nGriot: “… one by one, the twelve kings of the bright savanna country got up and proclaimed Sundiata ‘Mansa’ [king] in their turn. Twelve royal spears were struck in the ground in front of the dais. Sundiata had become emperor.” (page 75)\n\nOne of the 12 kings: Sundiata, Maghan Sundiata, king of Mali, in the name of the twelve kings of the ‘Bright Country’, I salute you as ‘Mansa’.\n\nGriot: Djata’s justice spared nobody. He followed the very word of God. He protected the weak against the strong… Under his sun the upright man was rewarded and the wicked one punished.”\n\n“In their new-found peace the villages knew prosperity again, for with Sundiata happiness had come into everyone’s home. Vast fields of millet, rice, cotton, indigo and fonio surrounded the villages.”\n\n“There are some kings who are powerful through their military strength. Everybody trembles before them, but when they die nothing but ill is spoken of them. Others do neither good nor ill and when they die they are forgotten. Others are feared\n\nbecause they have power, but they know how to use it and they are loved because they love justice. Sundiata belonged to this group… He was the father of Mali and gave the world peace. After him the world had not seen a greater conqueror… and [the capital] Niani became the navel of the earth.”\n\n“The griots … used to boast of Niani and Mali saying ‘If you want salt, go to Niani, for Niani is the camping place of the Sahel caravans. If you want gold, go to Niani… If you want fine cloth, go to Niani, for the Mecca road passes by Niani. If you want fish, go to Niani, for it is there that the fishermen of … Djenne come to sell their catches. If you want meat go to Niani, the country of the great hunters, and the land of the ox and the sheep. If you want to see an army, go to Niani, for it is there that the united forces of Mali are to be found. If you want to see a great king, go to Niani, for it\n\nis there that the son of Sogolon lives, the man with two names.” (pages 81 – 82)\n\nSocial Studies\n\nMs. van Gigch\n\nName ____________________\n\nSection ___________________\n\nDate _____________________\n\nVideo Guide for Caravans of Gold\n\nFocus Question:\n\nAnalyze the ancient West African “caravans of gold” using the geography theme of movement: the movement of people, things, or ideas.\n\nCity of Jenne in Mali\n\n600 years ago, there was a trade network linking land and sea as far away as China and India.

Niane, listened to the griot Djeli Mamoudou Kouyate tell the Sundiata epic tale. Kouyate was a griot from the great Keita griot family, descended from the same family as Sundiata. Niane wrote down the epic in the Malinke language. It was later translated into English.\n\nDavid Wisnieski (Wiz – NESS- key) wrote and illustrated an English-language picture book version of the Sundiata epic based on the Niane writing from the griot Mamoudou Kouyate.\n\nEach griot learns the epic from their family and passes it on to their children. Each family might tell the story a little differently, especially because audience participation is important in the telling and would be different each time.\n\nGriots might also use music to accompany the storytelling, using traditional instruments such as the harp-like kora string instrument, or the balafon, which is like a wooden xylophone.\n\nOne person, who visited Mali, described hearing the Sundiata epic and after three days of storytelling, Sundiata hadn’t yet been born! This can be a long story!\n\nWe will hear the picture book version, in English, and we will supplement that with pieces from the longer translation.\n\nThis unit is available for free use in classroom but is covered by copyright.
