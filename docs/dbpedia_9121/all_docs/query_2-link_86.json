Nevertheless, the Trans-Saharan trade route also was able to obtain gold, ivory, metal ware, textiles, pepper, dates, beads, and leather. Consequently the quantity of goods led to an increase in wealth for Ghana. The Trans-Saharan trade route was able to exchange their luxury goods for pottery, glassware, and textiles from Persia, India, and China. Additionally during the 900’s the kings converted to Islam causing wealthy merchants to also convert. On the other hand, overland trade on the Silk Road produced silk, spices, and precious stones. Meanwhile sea-lanes on the Silk Road were capable of carrying bulkier items such as steel, stone, coral, and building materials. Because China was the only country that had cultivators and weavers with an outstanding knowledge of developing techniques, they were able to produce high-quality silk fabrics in classical\n\nOne of the most prominent effects of the cross cultural interaction was the Afro Eurasian Trade Network which helped increase revenue. The trade routes that were part of this network were the Mediterranean Sea Maritime Trade Route, Indian Ocean Maritime Trade Route, Eurasian Silk Road and the Trans-Saharan Trade Routes. The increase in trade resulted in the emergence of major cities such as Timbuktu, Jenne, Mogadishu, Mombasa and other Swahili city states. Another reason for the flourish of trade was the invention of new technologies such as caravans for traveling and the trading of luxury goods such as silk, cotton and porcelain. The dawn of new kingdoms such as Mali, Songhay and Sudan contributed to this effect as well. The spread of Islam resulted in\n\nThe early civilizations of Africa were different in many of their cultural traits. One common trait they did have in common was the importance of trade in their society. Although trade was good for the African civilizations, there was consequences that followed trading. I will be using documents B, F, and D to support how early African civilizations had consequences from trading. In document B it states that, “The door of the pavilion is guarded by dogs on an excellent breed… who wear collars of gold and silver,” this quote helps support the idea that Ghana had lots of gold and wealth.\n\nMansa Musa expanded the Mali empire and was a very smart and generous person. He had lots of wealth. An Egyptian official describes him as very generous, as there was no one who did not receive a sum of gold from him (Document 4). Timbuktu is a name of a city in Mali that has a very highly sophisticated political structure. They have many doctors, judges, priests, and other men who are very intelligent and well taught. The importance of education in Ghana led to better health for the people living there. Also in Ghana they have manuscripts and written books brought there that are sold for more money than any other merchandise (Document\n\nThe History of Africa is very interesting. They had many trade routes and many resources such as salt and gold, their most popular resource was gold. Mansa Musa was their leader and had gone on the Haji as a duty and made their empire known throughout other countries. After that journey the empire had expanded even more that from the start of when their empire first rose up. As you could tell Mansa Musa was a good leader because of the choices he had made to create africa today. In Medieval Africa, Mansa Musa had an Economic impact on Africa because of the duty of islam and the value of gold.\n\nThe Byzantine Empire needed the metal to create an economy and many products. The route kept on expanding to be a more traditional trade route of the Silk Road between Europe and the Middle East. The camel caravans and oases were the primary modes of transportation to make it possible for the buyer and seller to communicate about the product and slave. The camels were perfectly suited to the travel through the Sahara from moving for extended periods of time and carrying heavy packages. The transportation also helped cultural exchange between Africans and Arabs. The Trans-Saharan trading enriched the African kingdoms beyond what would have been possible without it.\n\nLastly between the brothers: Siga who is sent with Tiekoro as protection to Timbuktu who becomes forgotten by his own brother as they refuse him because he is not Muslim. And Naba, who loses his role model, and grieves on his behalf. As Islam continues to spread and conquer more and more lands, the more families become split as parents send their children to schools to learn how to write and speak Arabic. When Tiekoro left for Timbuktu the Troare family continued to divide and separate due to continuous forces by foreign expansion and hunger for riches. As a son of a slave woman who had drowned herself, Siga isn’t regarded with nearly as high as prestige as Tiekoro is, despite them only being a couple hours apart in age. After being banished away for not being Muslim, Siga adjusted to his environment with the help of a kind boy and, after being a donkey boy for a while, decides to go into trade. Trade goes completely against the respectable income of a Bambara nobleman, which can be made through cultivating agriculture because the Troare family “owned plenty of good land planted with millet, cotton, and fonio, worked by hundreds of slaves” (Conde 4). Especially because the Mali Empire had been on fertile land where many different kinds of crops such as ones of sorghum, millet, and fonio could be maintained and the domestication of animals like sheep, goats, and cattle had been strong (Africa 141). Although the way of a Bambara had been agriculture,\n\nMuslims controlled the trade routes in Mali which made it easier for Battuta in order to maneuver around the empire because of the fact that he is also a Muslim and traveled throughout the Islamic world. Some Malians would use salt as a medium of exchange even though gold and silver were used mostly everywhere else. Gold, copper, salt, kola nuts, and spices were immensely crucial to the Malian economy, its gold is very important around the world. Battuta explains on the occasion of former king of Mali Mansa Musa went to Cairo two years prior before him and the king “flooded Cairo with his kindness” which would upset their gold market for many years. Social inequality was an issue in Mali, prisoners that were capture were made into slaves, especially women, they were gathers and served as concubines for example, Battuta illustrates how women servants and slaves girls are practically naked in front of everyone including Mansa Suleyman daughters. Men either hunt or maintain the structure of the house. Battuta also expressed his dislike of the way Malian’s were not ritually slaughtering their animals. However he praises how clean the natives are in the mosque on Fridays and memorizing the Quran by"
