        "text": "A lot of Mali’s success came from their very generous and humble ruler named Mansa Musa (Doc.4). Mansa Musa took a hajj to Mecca to learn and give a chance to the monotheistic culture of Islam. When he returned to Mali, he spread Islam throughout it and eventually it spread all throughout Western Africa by merchants bringing their culture and religion with them when they traded and spreading their beliefs. The capital of Mali was Timbuktu, a very successful city that produced many of Africa's greatest scholars at the time and had a library with many books and manuscripts that would have sold for a fortune (Doc.5). The government of Mali also had a very strict set of laws, most similar to Hammurabi's code of laws from ancient Babylonia. Its laws were very harsh and they showed no mercy for any crime. Even if you stole the littlest thing you would still be punished greatly. Mali also had very great security from outside invaders. These two things impressed many other rulers of similar kingdoms, and made people not commit any crimes in Mali\n\nOne reason that the geography helped the development of the kingdom of Ghana was because of trade. According to Document A, there were gold and salt mines surrounding Taghaza and Timbuktu. This shows that those cities were very likely to be involved in trade and that it would have been an effective trade, as one city wanted salt and the other city wanted gold. According to Document B, “The Arab traders of this region wanted gold as much as the Wangara wanted salt…” This shows that trade\n\nThere are many similarities and differences in the prosperous Mongol and Mali Empires. One similarity is that both the Mongol and Mali Empire lived in nearly uninhabitable places. The Mongols in the steppe and Mali in the desert. The steppe biome has unfertile soil and the desert is very dry with poor soil for farming. Another similarity would be that both empires had very powerful leaders that helped build a better empire. Powerful Mongol leaders were Genghis Khan and Kublai Khan. A powerful Mali leader was Mansa Musa. It is said that he made it “rain” gold on a pilgrimage to Mecca. A third similarity is that both empires were extremely tolerant of other religions. Although Mansa Musa, the Mali emperor, adopted Islam as his main religion, he didn’t force his people and subjects to follow the same one. He let them worship other religions. In the Mughal Empire, which is based of the Mongol empire, Akbar the Great promoted religious tolerance. He was Muslim, but he sought wisdom from the holy men of all faiths. There are some differences as well. A difference would be that different weapons were used in battle in the Mali and Mongol Empires. Mali focused more on arrows and javelins while the Mongols didn’t. The Mongols used very powerful short-bows on horseback and gunpowder started forming! Another difference is that Mali expanded through trade and Mongols through conquest. An example of a Mongol conquest would be the capture of the Xi Xia. Mali thrived and expanded\n\nGold and salt mines surrounded Ghana and were kept a secret from the other countries who might want to get in on the great wealth of Ghana. Another reason Ghana had an opulent economy was because people loved books and would pay a great fortune to buy them. In Document 1 it talks about how the location of Ghana was important to the economy and in Document 4, people in Ghana lived on to do great tasks, because of the knowledge they got from all the books they bought. As seen in the map in document 1, it shows Ghana located directly in the middle of 12 gold and salt mines which they kept private so no one could steal their good fortune (Document 1). In the fourth document it reads,“Here are many doctors, judges, priests, and other learned men that are well maintained at the king's costs. Various manuscripts and written books are brought here . . . and sold for more money than other merchandise” (Document 4). This is helpful because they used the mines to trade with people who did not have the opportunity to collect gold and salt, but needed it. The salt is used to keep food fresh in warmer areas, and the gold is used for trading. They also highly appreciated books and would pay a substantial of money to get them. Books started to even become more highly priced than items like merchandise. The location of Ghana contributed greatly to the rich and wealthy atmosphere of Ghana as well as\n\nThe Byzantine Empire needed the metal to create an economy and many products. The route kept on expanding to be a more traditional trade route of the Silk Road between Europe and the Middle East. The camel caravans and oases were the primary modes of transportation to make it possible for the buyer and seller to communicate about the product and slave. The camels were perfectly suited to the travel through the Sahara from moving for extended periods of time and carrying heavy packages. The transportation also helped cultural exchange between Africans and Arabs. The Trans-Saharan trading enriched the African kingdoms beyond what would have been possible without it.\n\nThe Kingdom of Ghana was a rich and mysterious country. The Ancient country lay where Maturia, Mali, and Senegal are to day. The kingdom existed from 700-1200 A.D. but people had been living in the area since the Fourth century A.D. Ghana's Golden age was from the Ninth to the Eleventh century A.D. During this time gold was abundant along with salt and other valuable goods. These items made Ghana a rich nation where the primary income was made from trading with the Arabs and other African nations. Even though trading was the main source of income, most of the common people were farmers. These farmers grew crops like corn, wheat, and rice. All of these reasons make the Ancient Kingdom of Ghana a desireable place to move to.\n\nFor centuries, European nations had been trading slaves, gold, ivory, and more with the west coast of Africa. Throughout the early 1800s, Europeans barely knew anything about the rest of the country of Africa. This quickly changed as Europe grew a sudden interest in exploring the rest of the country and taking advantage of their many valuable resources. Many wonder what motivated Europeans to Imperialize Africa, or extend their country’s power throughout Africa. The driving forces behind European Imperialism in Africa were the strive for ultimate power in Africa between competing countries, the need for money and technological advancements in European civilizations, and the constant attempt for Europeans to spread their cultures throughout\n\nEven before Europeans came to Africa, the kingdoms in Africa were quite wealthy. As previously mentioned, Ghana was a very strong kingdom in which its people were also incredibly wealthy. Their government appeared to be wealthy as well, which assisted Ghana in being able to control the gold and salt trade. An Arab scholar, Al-Bakri, wrote about the king’s court and how basically everything that the court had was gold (Document 2). The point of view of this document was also positive, and that is because scholars are usually upper class, just like the king’s court. Al-Bakri thought very highly of the court, and explains in detail how every person has some gold on them and how their surroundings also possessed gold. Ghana had a strong army and an intelligent political counsel, which made other countries fear them. Nations around Ghana did not want to start problems and usually just maintained peace with Ghana (Document 3). Ghana was not the only successful kingdom, one of the leaders of Mali, Mansa Musa,\n\nThe second Empire that was more extensive was Mali in West Africa. They were dominating in the 13th and 14th century. This empire was one of the largest trading posts in the world, which had roots in the gold of West Africa. Mali Empire flourished because of the trade above all else. This empire contained three immense gold mines within its borders unlike the Ghana Empire, which was only a transit point for gold. The taxed every single once of gold, cotton and salt that entered its borders. Mali was the source of almost half the old world’s gold exported from mines in Bambuk, Boure and Galam. The gold nuggets were the exclusive property of the mansa, and were illegal to trade within his borders. All gold was immediately handed over to the imperial treasury in return for an equal value of gold dust. The gold dust had been weighted and bagged for use at least since the reign of the Ghana Empire. The next great unit of exchange in this empire was salt. Salt was as valuable, if\n\nHowever, the Mali Empire’s power was weakened due to quarrels about orderly succession of the emperors. When the Songhai Empire realized that weakness at the center of Mali, they started rebelling. In 1375, Geo rebelled. Soon Songhai Empire began its expansion at the expense of Mali. They conquered Mema, Timbuktu from the Tuareg. The military commander responsible for these victories, Sunni Ali Ber, was considered the first great ruler of the Songhai Empire. He continued to expand and build the empire by taking control of important Trans-Saharan trade routes as well as other cities and provinces of Mali. Trade had a significant influence on the history of these empires. The riches made through these trades contributed to build larger kingdoms and empires. In order to protect their trade, they build even larger armies. The slave trade was the most important contributor to their economic development. “The Songhai kingdom under the rule of Askia Mohammed used slaves as soldiers. Slaves were trusted not to overthrow their rulers. Sometimes, slaves were given position such as royal advisers because “Songhai rulers believed that slaves could be trusted to provide unbiased advice unlike other citizens who held a personal stake in the outcome of decisions” (Tesfu 2015).\n\nDuring the eighth century throughout the late sixteenth century, one trade route entranced everyone involved from the Mediterranean to the Africa’s. The Trans – Saharan Trade was an important trade route that ran across the Sahara between the Mediterranean countries and West Africa. In the beginning stages of the Trans- Saharan trade many small trade routes were being used throughout the period. this is because travelling across the Sahara before the domestication of the camel was difficult. The Trans-Saharan trade route did more than attract traders. This route was an economical boost for many and also connected the West African people with the Mediterranean people."
