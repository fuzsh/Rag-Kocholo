        "text": "The article below uses “Three Close Reads”. If you want to learn more about this strategy, click here.\n\nFirst read: preview and skimming for gist\n\nFill out the Skimming for Gist section of the Three Close Reads Worksheet as you complete your first close read. As a reminder, this should be a quick process!\n\nSecond read: key ideas and understanding content\n\nFor this reading, you should be looking for unfamiliar vocabulary words, the major claim and key supporting details, and analysis and evidence. By the end of the second close read, you should be able to answer the following questions:\n\nWho was Mansa Musa, and why might he have had a problem with his portrayal in the first photo?\n\nExamine the map shown in the article. What does it tell us about settlements of communities in the Sahel?\n\nWhat is the Sahelian state model? What is its significance?\n\nWhat is religious pluralism? How is it relevant to understanding west African communities?\n\nWhat are some of the arguments for and against considering Mali an empire?\n\nThird read: evaluating and corroborating\n\nAt the end of the third close read, respond to the following questions:\n\nCan you think of other societies you’ve learned about in which the state supported religious pluralism? Which societies, and when?\n\nHow does this article support, extend, or challenge your understanding of the “state” when viewed through the filter of the communities frame?\n\nNow that you know what to look for, it’s time to read! Remember to return to these questions once you’ve finished reading.\n\nThe Golden King\n\nExamine the image below. A man sits in the middle of a late fourteenth century map, staring at a yellow orb, a nugget of gold. He is clearly a king, for he wears a crown and holds a scepter. To Europeans, these are symbols of kings, and the image was created by the European map-maker Abraham Cresques who lived in Spain around the year 1375. Yet the king is African, not European. He is Mansa Musa I, ruler of the state of Mali, and is possibly the wealthiest man of his time. He probably did not really have a crown or a scepter because these were not West African symbols of kingship. But the gold nugget is accurate because Mansa Musa controlled some of the richest goldfields of this era.\n\nThere were plenty of West African states in this era, but Mansa Musa's Mali is the one that shows up in world history texts because it left behind the most evidence. Mali emerged from a region that had given birth to many states in earlier centuries. Also, unlike North Africa and Europe, the collapse of the Roman Empire was not felt in West Africa. But it certainly had its own political patterns and connections to those other parts of the world. As early as 300 CE, trade routes crossing the Sahara Desert linked North Africa, including Roman controlled regions, to the growing cities in West Africa. These cities, including Jenne-Jeno, were relatively egalitarian and had little centralized authority. But that changed by 800 or 900 CE.\n\nStates and Trade in the Sahel to 1100 CE\n\nThe region south of the Sahara Desert was known as the Sahel, or sometimes the Western Sudan (this region is far to the west of the current countries of Sudan and Southern Sudan). This was mostly dry grassland, with some wetter areas, including two large rivers called the Senegal and the Niger. Plus there were several lakes in an area known as the Chad Basin1‍. These wet areas could support large populations of people. As usual, that created a need for organization and governance. So different communities built states, sometimes collaboratively, and sometimes forcefully. The earliest we know of was Wagadu, the state we usually call by the title of its ruler, Ghana. Headquartered near the Niger River, it was probably established around the end of the sixth century. Nearby, the city of Gao controlled a region that we know as Kawkaw. Further to the east, a number of communities combined to build the state of Kanem in the Chad Basin around the ninth century. Other states in this region soon followed, and it didn't hurt that many shared the same language, called Hausa. To the west, the state of Takrur was built on the Senegal River around the ninth century. It was sometimes under the control of Wagadu, and sometimes independent.\n\nThese kingdoms competed and fought with each other, conducted diplomacy, formed alliances, and generally shared ideas about how to manage a kingdom. Despite their diversity and the vast size of this region, they had three major elements in common. We call these the Sahelian state model.\n\nFirst, these states generally relied on the domination of long-distance trade for the funds they needed to govern and survive. Wagadu, for example, controlled a large portion of the gold trade because it sat in the middle of the trade route that sent the gold north. Most West African gold in this period was mined a hundred miles or so south of Wagadu, and it was in great demand in North Africa and Europe, thousands of miles to the north. Meanwhile, the Hausa states and Kanem controlled the sale of kola nuts, grown in the forests to the south and mostly used as a stimulant in North Africa and the Middle East. (Kola has caffeine and was one of the original ingredients that made Coca-Cola such a stimulating drink!) Takrur controlled regional trade in grain and salt. These states also manufactured goods, especially textiles, but their governments were more focused on trade because it was easier to tax.\n\nSecond, these states all relied on densely populated, wet, grain-producing centers. They had little control over the people in the drier regions around them—most of whom were nomadic herders. The governments of the big states couldn't really rule them, and in fact the nomads sometimes raided or invaded the cities around the lakes and rivers. The most control these governments could exert over the nomads was the occasional demand of tribute, usually in the form of some trade goods, money, or animals.\n\nFinally, all of these states had to deal with religious diversity. From at least the ninth century, Islam was a powerful force in the West African Sudanic zone. It was the religion of the traders from North Africa, and soon some West African merchants became Muslims as well. But most of the people of the Sudan in this period, especially farmers followed local, non-Muslim religions. A few rulers chose to convert to Islam because it was useful for trade and because it had a written language. The Kings of Takrur and Kanem became Muslim by the eleventh century, for example. But most kings did not. Instead, they were very inclusive. Both Muslims and members of local religions served in their courts. Rulers allowed many different sets of rituals, and themselves participated in multiple types of prayers and practices. One of the unique local features that remained important was matrilineality, or tracing one's heritage and ancestry through the mother. At the state level, this included political power for royal queen mothers (the mothers of kings), which was not a normal feature of Islam in many other regions. This flexibility and inclusiveness of faith—known as religious pluralism—remains a feature of many of the communities of this region today."
