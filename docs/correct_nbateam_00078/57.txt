The Warriors traded shooting guard Jason Richardson to the Charlotte Bobcats on Thursday for the rights to North Carolina forward Brandan Wright, whom the Bobcats had drafted No. 8 overall.

With the trade, the Warriors cut salary and nab one of the best athletes in the draft in Wright (6-foot-9, 205-pounds). They also get help for their limited front line and a shot of nitro for their up-tempo game.

In Richardson, the Bobcats get the proven scorer they need in their backcourt to go with their young core of power forward Emeka Okafor, point guard Raymond Felton and small forwards Gerald Wallace, a free-agent-to-be, and Adam Morrison.

Acquiring Wright comes at a price for Golden State. Richardson, who will make $11 million next season, has been the heart of the Warriors the last few years.
