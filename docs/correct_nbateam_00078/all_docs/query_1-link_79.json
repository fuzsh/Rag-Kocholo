        "text": "ATLANTA | Jason Richardson is retiring after a 13-year NBA career in which he averaged more than 23 points a game for Golden State 10 years ago.\n\nThe 34-year-old swingman signed with the Atlanta Hawks in August. He played 19 games with the Philadelphia 76ers last season, his play shortened by a knee injury.\n\nRichardson announced his retirement on Facebook, a move confirmed by the Hawks on Thursday. He says his decision was “hard and tough” but made easier by “choosing my family and my health.”\n\nRichardson also has played with Phoenix, Orlando and Charlotte. He averaged 17.1 points a game, including three seasons over 20 points. He set a career high with 23.2 points per game with the Golden State Warriors in the 2005-06 season."
