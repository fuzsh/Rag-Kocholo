        "text": "Jason Richardson was in a great mood earlier today when he called in for a “TK Show” conversation–thrilled by the Warriors’ 13-0 start, the big comeback victory last night, and looking forward to Tuesday night, when the Warriors are honoring him at Oracle Arena.\n\nThere’s a reason why Richardson is one of the most popular Warriors of all-time: He played so hard, he cared so much, he was always so authentic, and he connected so thoroughly with the Warriors fan base.\n\nAnd when you hear him talk about the Warriors trading him in 2007–months after the “We Believe” season–you hear exactly how sharply and bitterly his heart was broken by the move.\n\nI asked Richardson about this current team–and he said no doubt, the Bulls’ 72-10 record is definitely in jeopardy.\n\nWe also talked about his “little brother” Draymond Green, who, like Richardson, is from Saginaw, Mich., and went to Michigan State, we talked about breaking in as rookies with Gilbert Arenas and Troy Murphy, and the insanity of “We Believe” a few years later.\n\nJason sounds very comfortable in his new retirement–driving the kids around, relaxing at home, and looking at his next career step."
