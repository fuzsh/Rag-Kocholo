        "text": "SPRINGFIELD — Bishop Gorman’s Jase Richardson got the Hoophall Classic crowd on its feet in the second half of a game against Wheeler High School from Georgia on Saturday.\n\nThe junior flew down the court in transition and dropped a one-handed dunk on top of a Wheeler player while getting fouled.\n\nAfter the play, Richardson strutted toward the sideline, tapping his head while getting high-fives from his teammates.\n\nJase’s brother, Jaxon, a freshman at Bishop Gorman, was on the court for the play. He was impressed, but didn’t want his brother to have all the fun.\n\nDuring the fourth quarter, Bishop Gorman stole the ball from Wheeler and got out on the break.\n\nJaxon flew down the left wing and received a pass while cutting into the paint. The freshman finished off the play by jumping up and slamming in a thunderous two-handed dunk, creating his own highlight moment.\n\n“He always has to out do me in some way,” Jase Richardson said with a smile.\n\nPowered by 20 points from Jaxon Richardson (9-for-9 from the field) and 14 points from Jase Richardson, Bishop Gorman defeated Wheeler, 82-66, on Saturday at the Hoophall Classic.\n\nJaxon Richardson was named the game’s MVP.\n\n“I’m very happy that I played good and my teammates helped me,” Jaxon Richardson said. “I’m proud that my brother got his body, that caught me off guard. I’m just happy to be a part of the team.”\n\nThe Richardson brothers are the sons of former NBA player, Jason Richardson.\n\nJase is a junior and has taken an official visit to Michigan State, where he holds a scholarship offer. He also has scholarship offers from Arizona State, Arkansas, Florida, Kansas, Stanford and Washington. According to ESPN, Jase is the No. 32 player in the Class of 2024.\n\nJaxon just recently turned 15 years old and is new to high school basketball this year. The freshman has an offer from UNLV, but hasn’t heard much from other schools.\n\nBishop Gorman coach Grant Rice thinks that is going to change soon.\n\n“He’s fitting right in,” Rice said. “Jaxon is a guy that does whatever the team needs. It’s cliche, but it’s true. He doesn’t expect to have plays ran for him. He plays defense, rebounds, gets the loose ball. He was 9-for-9 tonight; dunks, awkward layups. It was unbelievable. We are happy to have him. He does a lot of things that makes the team win.”\n\nJase remembers when he and Jaxon were in elementary school and played basketball together in their backyard, pretending to play together at a place like the Hoophall Classic.\n\nWatching his younger brother come through on a big stage was a cool moment for him.\n\n“I’m so proud of him,” Jase Richardson said. “He did his thing. Most definitely proud of him.”\n\nThe brothers want to see each other succeed, but that doesn’t mean that their competitiveness doesn’t shine through during games and at practice.\n\n“They’ve been known to argue a bit at practice, to say the least,” Rice said.\n\nUsually when players argue with each other, Rice steps in and tells them to clear it up, but when it’s a pair of brothers, like Jase and Jaxon, he lets them resolve it themselves most of the time.\n\n“When two players get into it, you don’t want to see it,” Rice said. “But when they’re brothers, you let it go, because I’m sure it happens at home. I let them figure it out.”\n\nTheir arguments come from a place of competitiveness, but when it comes to recruiting and scholarships, there’s no jealousy between the two.\n\nWith Jase in the middle of his recruitment process, Jaxon has used his older brother as a resource as he starts his own college recruitment journey.\n\n“I can see what he does and it guides me,” Jaxon said. “He helps me take the steps I need to and avoid the ones I don’t.”\n\nJase was sidelined for nine months last year due to a right knee injury and wasn’t able to play basketball during the entire summer.\n\nWith his one-handed slam in the second half as evidence, his knee feels fine during games now, but he is on a minutes restriction from the coaching staff and ices it after every game to keep swelling down.\n\n“He’s a warrior,” Rice said about Jase. “He’s battling. … You never want to go through something like this, but you saw him on the dunk. He’s getting back to his normal self.”\n\nOn the recruiting front, Jase is looking forward to scheduling an official visit to Arkansas toward the end of the season.\n\n“I’m trying to see what schools want me on campus and to see what the programs are about,” Jase Richardson said."
