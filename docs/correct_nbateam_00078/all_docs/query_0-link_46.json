        "text": "CHARLOTTE, N.C. – Another game, another hopeful but overmatched opponent, another reason for the Lakers to be wary as their marathon trek nears its end.\n\nThe Lakers took care of business Monday night against the Charlotte Bobcats, nothing more and nothing less, leading from start to finish and winning, 106-97. The Lakers weren’t overpowering, but they didn’t need to be against Charlotte.\n\nThe Lakers have one more of these games, the last in a string of three in four days against weak opponents, before they reach the All-Star break.\n\nTheir game Wednesday against the Minnesota Timberwolves might be the most important of all the nine games on this trip, however.\n\nWinning six of their first eight simply means it’s time for the Lakers to be a little greedy.\n\nThey want to take seven of nine. Nothing less will please them at this point.\n\n“We put ourselves in a good position, but we’re still upset that we let those two get away,” Kobe Bryant said after scoring 31 points on 9-for-17 shooting to lead the Lakers. “We believe we should be sitting here at 8-0.\n\nWe honestly feel that way. Now it’s time to go to Minnesota and finish this trip off the right way.”\n\nExpectations were minimal when the Lakers departed Jan. 30 for Detroit and the start of their trip. Five victories might have been a reasonable goal at that point. Four victories might not have been viewed as disastrous.\n\nBut the Lakers put together two three-game winning streaks after trading for Pau Gasol on Feb. 1. They also managed to subdue two struggling teams, the Miami Heat and the Bobcats, and now have a chance to do the same to the Timberwolves (10-39).\n\nNeither Sunday’s win over Miami (9-40) nor Monday’s over Charlotte (18-34) will go down in the lore of great Lakers games. In fact, they were similar in the way the Lakers built an early lead, held it and then turned back a late run by the opposition.\n\nBryant and Gasol got the Lakers (34-17) pointed in the right direction against the Bobcats, scoring 18 and 16 points, respectively, in the first half. Gasol made his first six shots en route to 26 points by game’s end.\n\nThe Lakers built a 13-point lead and seemed poised to turn the game into a rout in the second half, but just as Miami did Sunday, Charlotte rallied.\n\nAnd just as they did against the Heat, the Lakers refused to give away the game to the Bobcats. The Lakers had their moments of weakness late in their last two games, but they did not fold in the fourth quarter like they did in last Wednesday’s loss to Atlanta.\n\n“When you play a team with a bad record, you can never underestimate them,” said Lamar Odom, who had eight points and a team-leading 10 rebounds Monday.\n\n“As a team, we still have to go out and handle our business. It’s all about the win. You don’t just go out there and play. You play to play.”\n\nThe Bobcats didn’t exactly roll over and play dead for the Lakers despite missing leading scorer Gerald Wallace, who was sidelined because of a right foot strain. They also refused to be pushed around one night after the Detroit Pistons thumped them.\n\nIn fact, Charlotte trailed the Lakers by only 89-86 after Matt Carroll’s three-point play with 7:17 remaining in the game. Lakers coach Phil Jackson was so displeased with his second unit that he replaced all of them but Luke Walton in a mass substitution.\n\nBryant, who was on the floor at the time, also took a seat.\n\nWhen Bryant returned moments later, he helped the Lakers pull away for good.\n\nHe made a short jumper in the paint to put the Lakers ahead by 96-90. Then Walton hit a jumper from the left corner and the lead was back to eight points.\n\nGame over.\n\n“We have one more game before we can say anything about this trip,” Jackson said. “Fortunately, we have gotten a few wins under our belt and now we are down to one game and we want to get that one to go home on.”"
