        "text": "SAGINAW, MI\n\n— On Monday, Feb. 22, 1999, one of the greatest plays in Saginaw sports history occurred in arguably one of the best high school basketball games the city has ever witnessed.\n\nBut if you weren’t one of the 6,000 people inside Wendler Arena at the then-Saginaw Civic Center, you probably didn’t see it.\n\nUntil now.\n\nIn 1999, YouTube didn’t exist, and social media was in its infancy. The footage of the game was stored away at Saginaw Educational Television.\n\nCurrent Saginaw Valley State University Media Relations Director J.J. Boehm was the play-by-play commentator for SETV then and was new to the area. Boehm said he was impressed by the talent and called it the “zenith of high school sports in this community.”\n\nThe play?\n\nA three-quarter court lob pass to Jason Richardson, who dunked it.\n\n“It was a highlight among highlights,” Boehm said. “This was during a pre-YouTube era, so it couldn’t be distributed to friends and relatives across the country.”\n\nThe second game of the annual series was supposed to be played the previous Friday at Saginaw High. It was moved to the Civic Center would host the game because of the overwhelming number of ticket requests and the anticipation surrounding the game.\n\nIt was my freshman year of high school, and when I walked inside Wendler Arena that night, I was one of the few who had an original ticket. In all my years of covering sports on every level, in four states, it’s still one of the greatest plays I’ve ever seen.\n\nIt was the first high school game at the venue since Bridgeport and Buena Vista faced each other in a 1994 matchup.\n\nSaginaw High was ranked second in the state (15-1) and was led by junior swingman Eugene Seals. A year later, Seals would finish second in voting for Mr. Basketball before heading to the University of Miami (Ohio) on a scholarship.\n\nSaginaw High's freshman point guard was Anthony Roberson. Roberson went on to be arguably the school's best player, a McDonald's all-American, and an NBA player.\n\nSaginaw High also had a guy named Charles Rogers, who went on to be the No. 2 overall pick in the 2003 NFL draft. He finished the game with a modest 21 points and 8 rebounds.\n\nBut while the Trojans' roster was loaded with future Division I football and basketball players, the Lumberjacks had a star of their own.\n\nThe Lumberjacks were ranked third in the state (13-2) and were led by future NBA star and two-time slam dunk champion Richardson.\n\nRichardson had verbally committed to play for Tom Izzo and the Michigan State Spartans. Then-Michigan State assistant coach Tom Crean was at the game. Crean is now the head coach at Indiana.\n\nWith all the talent in the building that Monday evening, Richardson still wound up as the best player on the floor. He brought the crowd to its feet when he took off for a 360-degree dunk just inches inside the free throw line. Saginaw High won the game 78-64, but Richardson did his part by pouring in 29 points and grabbing 12 rebounds.\n\nBut one play by Richardson and Lumberjacks point guard Tyron McMath turned a great game into a legendary moment.\n\n“Jason would catch everything, and I remember during a scrimmage we played in, throwing a bad pass, and it bounced off the floor, and he still caught it and dunked it,” McMath said. “He could just make up for everything.\n\n“We couldn’t throw a bad pass; we just had to lead him.”\n\nAfter a Saginaw High score, McMath started to dribble down the floor until he saw something out of the corner of his eye.\n\n“Jason put up his finger, and was like ‘throw it up,'” McMath said.\n\nRemembering the play that took place in the scrimmage, McMath said he initially thought he overthrew the three-quarter court lob pass.\n\n“I remember coach screaming ‘No! No! No!'” said McMath. “Coach Slaggert was super conventional, and he jumped up when the ball went up.”\n\nSeals was running back to cover his man on defense but didn’t think anything out of the ordinary was happening.\n\n“I really didn’t know what he was doing, we just saw the ball go up and just thought it was a long pass, and it went over guys' heads,” Seals said. “Jason ran and Tyron threw it to him, and we all just wanted to look away. We didn’t want to see it happen.”\n\n“I mean who throws an alley-oop from beyond halfcourt?\"\n\nAfter the play the game had to be stopped for several minutes. Fans stormed the court in awe of what just happened.\n\n“I just remember people dancing and high-stepping on the court like they had just scored a touchdown,” McMath said.\n\n“Being around Jason, you always saw him do crazy things, but a three-quarter court alley-oop is a little crazier than usual,” Seals said.\n\nThe Trojans went on to win the game, partly because of Roberson’s performance. The then-freshman scored 20 points and hit three crucial 3-pointers in the final period.\n\nFourteen years later, people still are talking about “The Play” from Saginaw in places as far away as Georgia.\n\n“That was 1999 ... it's been so many great players to come out of Saginaw since then ... and here I am living in Atlanta, and I run into a guy I don’t even know, and he mentions it to me,” McMath said. “I just feel blessed to be a part of something that people truly remember.\n\n“It was the best play, best pass, and best moment in basketball I’ve ever had.”"
