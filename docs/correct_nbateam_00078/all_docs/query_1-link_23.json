        "text": "David Zalubowski/Associated Press\n\nVeteran shooting guard Jason Richardson appeared in 19 games last season after missing the entire 2013-14 campaign due to a knee injury, but the 34-year-old isn't ready to retire just yet.\n\nOn Tuesday, the Atlanta Hawks announced they had signed the veteran:\n\nYahoo Sports' Marc J. Spears originally reported on Aug. 15 Richardson was expected to sign a non-guaranteed contract with Atlanta.\n\nParameters of the deal have not been reported.\n\nRichardson was absent from the regular-season hardwood for more than two years after undergoing knee surgery midway through the 2012-13 season with the Philadelphia 76ers, but he didn't let that deter his quest to contribute, as the Charlotte Observer's Rick Bonnell noted:\n\n\"I always been that guy who loved the game,\" Richardson said on Feb. 25, according to the Philadelphia Inquirer's Keith Pompey. \"I don't look at it as a job or paycheck. I just love basketball.\"\n\nLast season, J-Rich averaged 9.1 points, 3.5 rebounds and two assists while shooting 34.8 percent from the field and 32.3 percent from three.\n\nOver the course of his 13-year career, Richardson has drilled 1,608 triples, which ranks 16th all time, according to Basketball-Reference.com. Dirk Nowitzki resides one spot lower with 1,575 converted threes.\n\nWhile the non-guaranteed nature of Richardson's agreement doesn't ensure he'll make the Hawks' final roster, the team can take an extended look at the former Slam Dunk Contest champ over the next few months.\n\nThe Hawks can also get a feel for his leadership skills, which would certainly be of value to a squad on the rise in the Eastern Conference.\n\nAtlanta's got a bit of a logjam at the 2 with Kyle Korver, Tim Hardaway Jr. and Justin Holiday all under contract, but a resurgent showing in training camp could put Richardson on the Hawks' radar when final cuts approach."
