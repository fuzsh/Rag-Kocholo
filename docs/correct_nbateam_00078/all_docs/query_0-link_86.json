        "text": "Welcome to the 5th installment of the 2009-10 Phoenix Suns player report cards. We're still using the A-F system, but I decided to make it a bit more definitive for us all. No plus or minuses...\n\nToday we look at Jason Richardson.\n\nJason Richardson faced some serious challenges coming into this season. He was supposedly the crown jewel of the Bell/Diaw/Singletary trade. Expectations were high for the athletic, high scoring former two time dunk contest champion. In Golden State he was the main man, averaging 18 a game for six seasons. After being traded to the Bobcats, he put up 22 a game for an awful 2007-8 Charlotte squad.\n\nUpon his arrival in Phoenix, we all mourned the loss of Raja Bell, he of the Kobe clothesline, defensive minded and oft big shot maker from beyond the arc. But Richardson represented something different to many of us. Perhaps a pseudo superstar, a scorer, and exciting player that could give the Suns another scoring option along with good size at the 2 to help slow down the scourge of opposing 2's that were beginning to consistently have career nights against Phoenix. Rich could hit from downtown, he could slash to the rim, and he could post up the smaller two's in the league.\n\nBut it was an ugly start for Jason, that included some poor choices off the court coupled with inconsistent play on the court. With the exception of a handful of games, Richardson was largely a disappointment. Many around these parts were clamoring for either a trade of Rich and his large contract or a relegation to the bench in favor of everyone's favorite Brazilian Sun, Leandro Barbosa.\n\nInstead what we got this season was a more dedicated Jason Richardson. Rich showed up to training camp in good shape, eager to put his troubles behind him and focus on winning basketball games. He was very happy to be back with the guys, and most importantly, a Phoenix Sun. And what we got during the regular season was a better JRich. A more aggressive, mentally focused and in shape Rich. He was 3rd on the team in scoring, 4th in rebounds, and 2nd in 3-point makes. In 79 games, Richardson scored in double figures 61 times.\n\nI'll spare you the details about the Suns performance when Jason Richardson scores X points, this was the inside/outside joke of the season. So let us just say that the numbers support that the better Jason played, the better the Suns played. The numbers also support that Jason played much better after a day or two off.\n\nMake your conclusions however you like on that one. Bottom line, Jason Richardson had a better than average regular season.\n\nHe had ups:\n\nJason Richardson Floats a GW Jumper against the Oklahoma City Thunder (2/23/10) (via boygenius88)\n\nHe had downs:\n\nJason Richardson misses dunk vs Spurs (via makesco)\n\nAnd on to the postseason.\n\nJason Richardson had been to the playoffs only once in his 9 year NBA career, in 2007 with the Warriors. For an NBA player coming from a winner like Michigan State, that couldn't be fun. So perhaps this season was pretty special for JRich. The Blazers chose to let Jason roam free in the first round, and he made them pay, going 21-43 (49%) from beyond the arc, including 8 3's in Portland en route to a 42 point effort. In the close out game, again in Portland, Richardson hit 5-8 from three, putting up 28 points and 7 boards.\n\nSan Antonio also had difficulty bottling up JRich, as he tallied 27, 19, 21, and 11 points while shooting 12-23 (52%) from long range as the Suns swept the Spurs. Obviously the competition got tougher against L.A. and Richardson's numbers weren't as gaudy as the prior two series. Still, you cannot say that Rich disappeared as he shot 47% from the field and 14-35 (40%) from behind the arc\n\nHere are some more numbers to chew on:\n\n2009-10 Jason Richardson Statistics\n\nPOINTS PER GAME\n\nREBOUNDS PER GAME\n\nASSISTS PER GAME\n\n15.7\n\n5.1\n\n1.8\n\nFG%\n\nFT%\n\n3PT FG%\n\n47%\n\n74%\n\n39%\n\nPOINTS PER GAME PER 36 MINUTES\n\nREB PER GAME PER 36 MINUTES\n\nASSISTS PER 36 MINUTES\n\n17.9\n\n6\n\n3\n\nPOSTSEASON POINTS PER GAME\n\nPOSTSEASON REBOUNDS PER GAME\n\nPOSTSEASON ASSISTS PER GAME\n\n19.8\n\n5.4\n\n1.1\n\nPER\n\neFG%\n\nTS%\n\n16.63\n\n57%\n\n57%\n\nKey:\n\nPer-rating of a player's per minute productivity\n\neFG%-effective FG%, adjusting for 3pt FG worth more than a 2.\n\nTS%-true shooting percentage, taking into account 2 point FG's, 3's and FT's\n\n(Stats courtesy of hoops data and basketball reference)\n\nSTATISTICAL HIGHLIGHTS:\n\n3rd in NBA postseason 3-point makes (2nd in WC)\n\n5th in NBA postseason 3 point percentage\n\n5th in WC regular season 3 point makes among guards\n\n7th in NBA postseason scoring among guards\n\n8th in PER among WC shooting guards\n\n11th in NBA regular season 3 point makes\n\nIn simple terms, I liked the way Jason Richardson adjusted his mind and game this season. He was an integral part of the Suns run into the playoffs, and was huge in the postseason. In this system, on this team, Jason does his job. He shoots, he slashes, he rebounds. On the negative end, he was still prone to streakiness (aren't most 2's streaky?) and mental lapses on both ends of the floor. But this is Jason Richardson, not Kobe Bryant. What were we expecting?\n\nRich is an emotional guy. A bit more than average. His confidence dictates his success, as is the case with a lot of players. Still, it's a bit different with Jason. He needs to see the ball go through the hoop. And when it doesn't, he beats the crap out of himself. We saw this plenty this season, but we also saw him attempt to stay in the game on the boards and on the defensive end.\n\nGrade: B\n\nWhat say the rest of you?"
