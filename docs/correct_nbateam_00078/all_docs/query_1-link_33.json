        "text": "CEDAR CITY, Utah -- The Thunderbird men's basketball program and head coach Todd Simon has announced the signing of Jason Richardson, a guard from Fullerton College.\n\n\"Jason is an attacking guard that can make plays both for himself and his teammates,\" Simon said. \"He's also shown that he can rebound well from the guard position. His experience and maturity will be a great asset for us.\"\n\nWhile playing for the Hornets in Fullerton, California, Richardson started all 28 games and averaged 18.6 points per contest. He also averaged five assists and five rebounds. He had a season-high 32 points against Citrus on November 4th, dropping in 32 points.\n\nHe will come to Southern Utah University with two seasons of eligibility remaining.\n\nRichardson started his career at Cal State Northridge, where he appeared in 30 games as a freshman. He averaged 6.5 ppg and 2.4 apg his freshman year, and started in 12 games. He posted seven assists twice during the year and led the team in scoring against USC. He scored a CSUN career-high 22 points against South Dakota.\n\nThe Hawthorne, California native attended Junipero Serra High School where he was a four-year letterman and a captain for two of those seasons. He helped lead his team to a victory in the CIF IVAA Championships, and was named to the Daily Breeze All-Area Team. He was also a McDonald's All-American Nominee, along with being selected Del Rey Conference First Team All League. He was an honors student all four years, and was named Eugene Profit Scholar Athlete for having the highest GPA on the team. During his entire high school tenure, Richardson averaged 18.3 ppg, 5.6 rpg, 4.7 apg and 2.1 steals.\n\nRichardson will be joining a team that is fresh off the first-ever run to the Big Sky Conference Tournament Semifinals, with an upward trajectory heading into Simon's third year as head coach.\n\nRichardson will be immediately eligible to play starting next season.\n\nFollow the Thunderbirds all season @SUUBasketball on Twitter and Instagram and by liking the Southern Utah Basketball page on Facebook.\n\nRead all about the Thunderbirds on www.suutbirds.com."
