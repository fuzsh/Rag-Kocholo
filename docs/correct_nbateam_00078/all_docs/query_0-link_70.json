        "text": "The Cavaliers have already beat the Bobcats twice this season, but this Bobcats team is slightly different after shipping Jason Richardson to Phoenix. They proved it last night by knocking off the Celtics in overtime. The Cavs need an impressive win heading into their game with the Celtics on Friday and catching the 'Cats on the back half of a back-to-back could be just what the doctor ordered.\n\nTalk about the game here in the comments! They Auto-Refresh, bringing an awesome game night experience!"
