        "text": "JASON Richardson made a bold call about Kobe Bryant and revealed the moment he realized the former Laker's greatness.\n\nEx-NBA star Richardson thinks Kobe is the second greatest player to play the game, behind Michael Jordan and ahead of LeBron James.\n\nThe 42-year-old is a 14-year veteran in the NBA and a two-time Slam Dunk Contest champion.\n\nHis deepest run in the playoffs came with the Phoenix Suns in the 2010 season - where they ran into Kobe's Lakers.\n\nThe Suns went down in six games against the Lakers with Bryant going on to capture his fifth NBA title.\n\nRichardson told The U.S. Sun: \"We had an amazing team - Grant Hill, Steve Nash, Amare Stoudemire, Jared Dudley, Goran Dragic, Leandro Barbosa - it was a group of guys that really liked each other.\n\n\"That was the greatest thing about that team. We were all in for one common goal.\n\n\"We played together, we played for each other, nobody was selfish. It was one of my favorite teams to be a part of.\n\n\"It was a great matchup, they had Kobe and Pau Gasol, they were championship experienced and we weren't.\n\n\"They had one of the greatest players to ever play the game in Kobe Bryant and it was just a battle.\n\n\"That's when I realised Kobe was the second best player in the world ever in my opinion.\n\n\"In game six he went to a whole new level and we couldn't do anything with him.\"\n\nPhoenix went one better than that run in 2010 with Chris Paul and Devin Booker's team reaching the finals two years ago.\n\nThe Suns have added Kevin Durant from the Brooklyn Nets in a blockbuster deal this season.\n\nRichardson said: \"They got some big names - they've got three future hall of famers right now in my opinion with Chris Paul, Devin Booker and Kevin Durant.\n\n\"I think it's tough getting somebody midway through the season and trying to find a chemistry.\n\n\"But those guys are professional, those guys are hall of famers, those guys know how to play basketball.\n\n\"They're gonna figure it out and they're going to be deadly and dangerous to stop.\"\n\nBut the former NBA star struggled to pick a winner in this year's \"wide open\" playoff race.\n\nRichardson said: \"I don't think there's a clear cut favorite right now - so many teams are playing great basketball.\n\n\"You've got Sacramento coming out of nowhere and nobody is talking about and playing really good basketball.\n\n\"Golden State is always going to be a threat because of the experience they have over the years.\n\n\"Milwaukee, Philadelphia - it's hard to pick a winner right now.\n\n\"I think this is probably the most open race that we've had for the championship in a long time.\n\n\"My heart would bet on Golden State but my mind is telling me Philly is playing really well.\""
