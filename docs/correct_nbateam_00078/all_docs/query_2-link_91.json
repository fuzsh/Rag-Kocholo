        "text": "Synopsis\n\nBefore you dunk your way to legendary status, comes focus, discipline and professionalism. Jason Richardson on what goes into never taking your eye off the ball.\n\nTo use a basketball metaphor, NBA legend Jason Richardson isn’t likely to pass up a chance to return to India. In the country recently, Richardson coached young students across schools and came away impressed.\n\n\"I’m just used to American kids coming up to me and saying, \"Here, sign this!!\" They’re really brash. Kids here were so respectful and said, \"Please sir, sign this!\" and I was like \"Wow\"! They were very well-mannered kids. I’m going back and teaching my kids some discipline (laughs loudly),\" he says. A stay-at-home dad at present, the two-time Dunk Champion is considering front-office offers from the NBA as well as a coaching assignment. Based on a career running with a team, Richardson reveals the little things that go a long way towards winning the game.\n\nFocus and discipline. In all the winning teams that I played for, everyone who came in knew what their job was and executed it. You look at the teams which have won and they know when to be serious and when to have fun. The teams that I’ve been on, we all hung around off the court, at each other’s houses or going for a movie. We just wanted to win and it didn’t matter who scored.\n\nAre there any difficulties when players make the step up from college basketball to the NBA to earn millions of dollars?\n\nA lot of them don’t understand that even though it’s a sport, it’s a business. When you’re 20 years old and are given millions of dollars, you have to be professional.\n\nWho’s your favourite basketball player of your generation?\n\nFor the 80s and 90s, Dominique Wilkins. I also like Michael Jordan. For years, I thought I had Kobe (Bryant) figured out and he just kept adding stuff to his game.\n\n(Catch all the Business News, Breaking News, Budget 2024 Events and Latest News Updates on The Economic Times.)\n\nSubscribe to The Economic Times Prime and read the ET ePaper online.\n\n...moreless\n\n(Catch all the Business News, Breaking News, Budget 2024 Events and Latest News Updates on The Economic Times.)\n\nSubscribe to The Economic Times Prime and read the ET ePaper online.\n\n...moreless\n\nWhy leading doctors and scientists pin hope on green jackfruit to fight fatty liver and cancer\n\nYoungsters are roaming around derivatives fire.
