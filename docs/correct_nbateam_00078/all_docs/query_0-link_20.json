        "text": "In fact, the two have drawn comparisons to Michael Jordan and Scottie Pippen from the Queen City faithful.\n\nWhile I wouldn't go that far just yet, Wallace, Richardson, and the rest of the Bobcats aren't to be taken lightly.\n\nRicharson was acquired from the Golden State Warriors via a trade for Brandan Wright on draft night last year. His arrival gave the Bobcats something they'd been missing—a reliable scorer.\n\nRichardson has also brought strength and athleticism, as well as a long-range jumper to complement Matt Carroll's.\n\nAs for Wallace—his athletic ability on offense and defense has made him a candidate for the All-Star Game, and maybe the NBA's Most Improved Player Award. He is a good slasher, and shot-blocker.\n\nWith G-Force and J-Rich running the show, the Bobcats are one of the up-and-coming teams in the Eastern Conference.\n\nThe Cats have taken baby steps so far—but seem to be making the right moves, from drafting Emeka Okafor, Raymond Felton, and Jared Dudley to acquiring Richardson.\n\nOf course, the news hasn't been all good. Sean May has been injury-prone since he was drafted, and is looking like a bust. Charlotte also passed up the opportunity to draft Brandon Roy by selecting Adam Morrison instead.\n\nMorrison had a solid rookie campaign before going down with a year-ending injury during the 2007 preseason.\n\nAs for the rest...\n\nFelton has improved this season, averaging 14 PPG to go with seven assists.\n\nOkafor's numbers (13 points and 10 rebounds) have taken a small slide this year—but the shot-blocking has still been there, and he's still great when it comes to boxing out.\n\nIf he can become more consistent and stay healthy, Okafor can become a premier forward in the league\n\nMatt Carroll has been the quietest productive player on the roster. Even though he only averages 8.5 PPG, he shoots 39 percent from behind the arc. The stat line for Carroll over the last three games—19, 10, and 18 points—shows that he plays a vital role in the Charlotte offense.\n\nThe rookie Dudley, finally, has shown small spurts of what he's capable of with the right amount of minutes.\n\nTo his credit, first-year head coach Sam Vincent has done an exceptional job following in the footsteps of Bernie Bickerstaff. To get over the hump, though, he'll have to get his team to improve its 2-12 road record.\n\nIn any event, the Bobcats have a bright future. With few more adjustments—a consistent low-post scorer, a quality backup point guard—the Cats will have the pieces they need to compete in the mediocre Southeast Division.\n\nAnd who knows—if Morrison can come back at full strength, Charlotte fans might have their own Big Three to root for."
