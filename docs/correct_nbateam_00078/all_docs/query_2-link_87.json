        "text": "Did you miss the Sports Bash or do you just want to listen to it again?\n\nThe Sports Bash ON DEMAND gives you the chance to go back and hear what you missed. Its the Sports Bash with Mike Gill and Todd Ranck.\n\nHere is today’s show: Wednesday August 15th 2012.\n\nIs Philadelphia a basketball town\n\nWith the addition of Andrew Bynum, the debate arose asking the question on whether or not Philadelphia is a basketball town. It was a heated debate on The Sportsbash between Mike Gill and Ryan Messick. Mike Gill says Philadelphia is a passionate sports town, while Ryan Messick says basketball, especially with the Sixers finish in last place. Me? I just sat back and listened in enjoyment:\n\nEven More:\n\nAnd Even More:\n\nAnd Yes, Even More..I need an aspirin\n\nJ-Rich Calls In:\n\nOne of the newest Sixers met the media today in Center City with almost 2,000 fans screaming and chanting their names called in and talked with Mike and Ryan. Richardson said he's never been apart of a press conference like that and he's excited to join and mentor a young group of players, much like Grant Hill did with him when they played together in Phoenix.\n\nSportsbash Stock Exchange\n\n1. BUY OR SELL thinking more about Andrew Bynum after his press conference?\n\n2. BUY OR SELL Team Bobby Valentine after Red Sox fallout?\n\n3. BUY OR SELL Washington Nationals plan for Stephen Strasburg as \"pathetic?\"\n\n4. BUY OR SELL the Giants not re-signing Melky Cabrera?\n\nTop Tweets\n\nIt’s a Wednesday edition of Top Tweets brought to you by The NEW Mercedes-Benz of Atlantic City. Visit their website and drive home in a luxury car tomorrow!\n\n5 Questions\n\n1. Do you believe in the perfect game, no-hitter jinx?\n\n2. How long will it take for Reebok to drop Chad Johnson?\n\n3. Who is better at 27, LeBron or MJ?\n\n4. Besides Bynum, what new player will have the best season with Sixers?\n\n5. What's your favorite way to relax?"
