        "text": "Four-star guard Jase Richardson is following in the footsteps of his father, Michigan State great Jason Richardson, and committed to the Spartans on Sunday. Here’s what you need to know:\n\nJase Richardson, a 6-foot-3 and 180-pound prospect, is the No. 3 rated combo guard nationally and the No. 35 overall player in the 2024 class, according to the 247Sports Composite.\n\nJason Richardson played two seasons with the Spartans (1999-2001), made two Final Fours appearances and won the 2000 championship. He went on to have a 13-year NBA career.\n\nJase had narrowed down his list of top three schools to Michigan State, Alabama and Cincinnati.\n\nWhy Richardson chose Spartans\n\nIt was 50-50 between Alabama and Michigan State until the final buzzer but Tom Izzo lands his third commitment in the 2024 class.\n\nThe backcourt is set with Richardson at the point guard spot and Kur Teng next to him at shooting guard. This backcourt will be a lot of fun to watch as they both can score and facilitate. As for Richardson, this was the perfect fit. What Izzo and his staff have done with point guards over the last few years is remarkable.\n\nThey play early as freshmen, develop and win games. Richardson had a breakout summer, going up 11 spots in the rankings between June and September, finishing as the No. 35 prospect in the class. He ended his AAU career with averages of 20.8 points, 4.2 rebounds & 4.2 assists on 57/45/81 shooting splits at the Nike EYBL Peach Jam. — Tobias Bass, men’s basketball recruiting beat writer\n\nWhat’s next for Michigan State?\n\nThe Spartans have three commitments in 2024, Richardson, Teng and big man Jesse McCulloch. The staff is going heavily after high four-star wing Bryson Tucker. He hasn’t scheduled any visits yet but the Spartans are likely to get one of those visits. — Bass\n\nRequired reading\n\nPurdue, Michigan State are clear top tier in Big Ten men’s basketball media poll\n\nCollege basketball preseason Top 25: Kansas, Marquette, Duke lead 2023-24 rankings\n\n(Photo of Michigan State coach Tom Izzo: Joseph Maiorana / USA Today)"
