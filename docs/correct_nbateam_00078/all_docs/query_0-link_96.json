        "text": "WILMINGTON, N.C. (AP) — Charlotte Bobcats part-owner Michael Jordan returned to his hometown Friday to get his first glimpse of the team he remade in the off-season.\n\nJordan arrived to learn he may be shopping for big men after forward Sean May’s decision to have season-ending knee surgery.\n\nJordan, who has the final say on all basketball decisions, watched from the balcony as the Bobcats went through a 45-minute scrimmage at UNC Wilmington under new coach Sam Vincent.\n\n\"We had a good conversation. He’s very supportive of the way we’re practicing,\" Vincent said. \"He likes what he sees. It was real encouraging to have him come and watch what we’re doing.\"\n\nJordan declined to speak to reporters both after practice and earlier in the day, when he helped dedicate a reading room at the local children’s center where he played basketball as a kid.\n\nJordan was involved in a busy offseason, when he hired Vincent to replace Bernie Bickerstaff and pulled off a draft night trade with Golden State to acquire Jason Richardson.\n\nThe Bobcats also re-signed leading scorer Gerald Wallace and 3-point specialist Matt Carroll. They’re trying to sign forward Emeka Okafor to a contract extension before the end of the month.\n\nMay said Tuesday he’ll undergo surgery, a decision that leaves Charlotte thin in the frontcourt.\n\nJordan’s afternoon began at the Community Boys & Girls Club on the outskirts of Wilmington, where a younger Jordan spent countless hours as a kid.\n\nJordan, who donated US$100,000 to the club in March, dedicated a Bobcats-themed reading wing Friday, which will be stocked with books and other educational materials.\n\nAbout 100 children attended the brief ceremony, where Jordan spoke fondly of his memories of the center.\n\n\"For all these kids that are going to benefit from this, hopefully we have another Michael Jordan here somewhere in terms of their success,\" Jordan said. \"Not Michael Jordan per se in terms of basketball. Someone who just believes in their dreams and aspires to be the best person they can be.\"\n\nBobcats ready to run under new coach\n\nAfter his first training camp practice, new Charlotte Bobcats coach Sam Vincent joked he was happy no one was leaning over a trash can getting sick.\n\nWhen they weren’t running sprints, the Bobcats were pushing the ball up the floor on nearly every possession in scrimmages. And Vincent plans to keep it up all season.\n\n\"Get the ball and go,\" point guard Raymond Felton said of Vincent’s offensive philosophy.\n\nWhen the Bobcats acquired Jason Richardson from Golden State in a draft night trade and re-signed Gerald Wallace, Vincent decided the best way to use their athleticism was to become a running team.\n\nBut to run consistently over an 82-game schedule, conditioning is key. Getting into top shape was a priority in pre-camp workouts, and it continued in two-a-day practices this week at UNC Wilmington.\n\n\"I was on a running team last year, so I’m pretty much in shape,\" Richardson said. \"But I think a lot of guys were surprised at how good of shape you’ve got to be in to be in coach Vincent’s offence and with the way he wants to play on defence. It’s going to be a gut check this whole month to get ready for November.\"\n\nVincent believes the Bobcats will use their weapons best on the fast break with the speedy Felton in the middle and the athletic Wallace and Richardson on the wings.\n\n\"That’s when I’m at my strong point, when I run a lot,\" Felton said. \"The conditioning part, it was tough the first day. But we realize that’s something we need because we’re going to be running. And we’re going to be doing it from the start of the season to the end of the season. We need to be in great shape.\"\n\nVincent also wants his big men involved on the break. Emeka Okafor has lost weight and has moved well in camp. Athletic Ryan Hollins has been working at centre with the starters.\n\n\"I’ve slimmed down 10 pounds, so that will help. But the rest of the guys are athletic, so it’s really not going to matter,\" Okafor said. \"Everybody is sleek and fast and in good shape. And we ran a bit last year, too, so I don’t think it will be any problem at all.\"\n\nVincent has spent the majority of practices this week working on defence. That’s because he believes with Richardson and Wallace, plus shooters Matt Carroll and Adam Morrison coming off the bench, the Bobcats should have little trouble scoring after averaging 96.9 points last season.\n\n\"I’m a solid believer with the guys we have on this team, we’re going to be able to score points,\" Vincent said. \"We’ve prioritized defence and conditioning.\"\n\nThe downside to running is it can produce more turnovers. Felton committed 230 last season, and Charlotte had more turnovers than its opponents.\n\n\"When you’re playing that fast, it’s so important to take care of the basketball,\" assistant coach Phil Ford said. \"Because you’re going to produce so many more possessions, that gives you the opportunity to have more turnovers.\"\n\nBut with so many quick, athletic players, the Bobcats feel running is the best option.\n\n\"Because if you’re out pushing and running at every opportunity, more shots are going to go up, more points are going to go up,\" Wallace said. \"There’s more of an opportunity to score. Plus, if we’re playing up-tempo, that’s going to give me free range on defence.\n\n\"It’s going to be fun. I’m looking forward to it.\""
