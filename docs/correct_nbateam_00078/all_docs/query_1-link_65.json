        "text": "Retired basketball star Jason Richardson bought a flipped mansion in Miami.\n\nRichardson dropped $6.3 million on the 1.2-acre estate at 10010 Southwest 60th Street from Jeff Aririguzo, a source confirmed. Aririguzo is an e-commerce entrepreneur and influencer.\n\nJorge Uribe of One Sotheby’s International Realty had the listing, and Gisele Bonetti and Megan Clark of Coldwell Banker brought the buyer.\n\nRichardson had a 14-season career with the NBA, playing for the Golden State Warriors, Charlotte Bobcats, Phoenix Suns, Orlando Magic and Philadelphia 76ers between 2001 and 2015. He was the fifth overall pick in the NBA draft in 2001.\n\nReports emerged earlier this summer that Richardson’s sons, Jase and Jaxon Richardson, up-and-coming high school basketball stars, were transferring to Columbus High School in Miami. The Richardsons would be joining the twin sons of former NBA All-Star Carlos Boozer on the team, according to SBLive Sports. Jase Richardson, a senior this year, has received offers to play at Stanford University, University of Southern California, University of Alabama, and his father’s alma mater, Michigan State University.\n\nSign Up for the undefined Newsletter\n\nAririguzo bought the estate in unincorporated Miami-Dade County, just south of Olympia Heights, for $3.8 million last September, records show. Built last year, the 8,800-square-foot mansion includes five bedrooms, five bathrooms and one half-bathroom, according to property records. The 1.2-acre estate also has a gym, a pool and an outdoor kitchen. The listing also noted there are 14-foot ceilings throughout the home.\n\nAririguzo listed the mansion for $6.3 million in July, Redfin shows. The sale marks a 68 percent increase in price in one year.\n\nWith the move to South Florida, Richardson joins a crowd of basketball pros who own luxury real estate in the region.\n\nIn October, LeBron James bought a condo at Estates at Acqualina in Sunny Isles Beach for $9 million. Also last year, Miami Heat All-Star Jimmy Butler bought a South Miami home for $7.4 million."
