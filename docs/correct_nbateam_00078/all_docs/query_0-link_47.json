        "text": "Jason Richardson kept rising and firing from beyond the arc in the fourth quarter.\n\nRarely did he misfire.\n\nRichardson nailed four of his six three-point attempts and netted 14 of his 22 points in the final frame as the Philadelphia 76ers tallied a 104-98 victory over the Charlotte Bobcats.\n\n\"He was tremendous,\" Sixers coach Doug Collins said of Richardson. \"He was our ace of spades tonight.\"\n\nJrue Holiday recorded 13 points and a career-high 15 assists, while Evan Turner registered 25 points and 10 rebounds for Philadelphia, which has won three in a row and six of its last eight games.\n\nBen Gordon had 19 points off the bench for the Bobcats, who have dropped their last three contests.\n\n\"Any time you trade baskets with a good team, quality team like that, it's going to bite you in the butt,\" Gordon admitted. \"We didn't do a good job of getting stops when we needed, getting key rebounds when we needed.\"\n\nThe game was tied at 83-83 before the Sixers used a 12-4 run to pull away.\n\nRichardson, who has hit at least two 3-pointers in all 12 games he's played in this season, nailed a pair of triples during the outburst, while Turner's up- and-under scoop shot gave Philadelphia a 95-87 edge with 4:01 to play.\n\nA bit later, a Ramon Sessions reverse layup pulled Charlotte within 97-93, but Richardson's trey at the other end pushed the margin back to seven with 1:11 left and the hosts never got the deficit less than five the rest of the way.\n\nPhiladelphia outscored Charlotte, 27-25, in each of the first two quarters and led, 54-50, at the break.\n\nThe Sixers took a 76-73 cushion into the fourth.\n\nGame Notes\n\nPhiladelphia has won seven of its last eight meetings against Charlotte ... Thaddeus Young had 15 points and seven boards for the Sixers ... Philadelphia shot 51.2 percent (44-of-86) from the floor."
