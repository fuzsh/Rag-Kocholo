SAGINAW, MI â€” Former Arthur Hill star Jason Richardson knocked down four 3-pointers down the stretch to lead the Philadelphia 76ers to a 104-98 win over the Charlotte Bobcats, Friday, Nov. 30, at Charlotte.

Richardson scored 14 of his 22 points in the fourth quarter.

Evan Turner led the 76ers with 25 points, drawing the attention of the Charlotte defense and leaving Richardson open.

"I was very surprised," Richardson said in an ESPN.com story. "There were a couple of other times I looked at the clock and knew we had to burn some time. But I was shocked they left me open so many times."

Richardson was 9 of 17 from the floor, including 4 of 8 from the 3-point line. He added five rebounds, two steals, one steal and one blocked shot.

Richardson, 31, graduated from Arthur Hill in 1999 after winning the Mr. Basketball Award and leading the Lumberjacks to the Class A state title appearance.
