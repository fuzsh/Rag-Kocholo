Washington | With Jason Richardson leading the way, the Charlotte Bobcats are suddenly on their best run ever.

Richardson scored 34 points, and the Bobcats stretched their winning streak to a franchise-record five consecutive games by holding off the Washington Wizards 100-97 Saturday night.

The Bobcats, who are in their fourth season of existence, went 1-11 during February, but they are 5-0 in March.

Charlotte led by as many as 19 points in the first half and 92-84 with less than a minute remaining. But Washington got to 92-89 on a 3-pointer by Roger Mason Jr. with 28.7 seconds left, and then to 96-94 on Antawn Jamison's 3 over Richardson with 14.8 to go. Mason's two free throws pulled Washington to 97-96 with 10 seconds on the clock.

But Richardson then went 2-for-2 at the line, and Washington's Deshawn Stevenson intentionally missed his second foul shot with the score 99-97 and 5.6 seconds remaining. Matt Carroll added a free throw for the final margin.

Richardson is averaging 28.8 points this month, and he displayed a bit of everything against Washington.

That included a spectacular windmill dunk with 20 seconds left in the third quarter - he shot 5-for-5 in that period - and making five of his first seven 3-point attempts.

Washington had a chance to get back to .500 for the first time in more than a month but instead fell to 30-32, one game ahead of idle Philadelphia for sixth place in the Eastern Conference.

Hawks wins NBA's first replay since 1983

New score, same result. The Atlanta Hawks won the NBA's first replay since 1983, holding off the Miami Heat 114-111 in overtime in the completion of a protested game.

The NBA ordered the teams back to the court after upholding Miami's protest of a 117-111 loss to the Hawks on Dec. 19.

The Heat went to the league after the home team's stat crew mistakenly ruled Shaquille O'Neal - who's now with the Phoenix Suns - had fouled out with 51.9 seconds left in overtime when he actually had only five fouls.

The game resumed from the point of the protest and neither team scored during their brief time on the court. They got a 15-minute break, then returned to the court for their regularly scheduled game.

McGrady scores 41, Rockets win 18th in a row

Tracy McGrady and the Houston Rockets are making it look easy, even against the best teams in the Western Conference.

McGrady scored 41 points and the Rockets stretched their winning streak to 18 games with a 106-96 victory over the New Orleans Hornets.

The Rockets have won their last nine games by double digits and moved into a tie with the Hornets in the overall conference standings. Houston, 13-15 in mid-December, closed within one game of San Antonio in the Southwest Division.

The Rockets have the NBA's longest winning streak since the Los Angeles Lakers won 19 in a row in the 1999-2000 season.

Houston became just the seventh team in history to win 18 or more consecutive games.
