        "text": "MICHAEL Jackson fans around the world were left in shock when he suddenly died.\n\nOver the years the self-proclaimed King of Pop was just 50-years-old when he passed away.\n\nWhen did Michael Jackson die?\n\nMichael Jackson died on June 25, 2009 at 2.26pm.\n\nThe singer's personal physician Conrad Murray said he found the singer in bed and not breathing on the afternoon of June 25, 2009.\n\nThe pop legend had been rehearsing past midnight on the night of June 24, 2009 ahead of a series of comeback concerts at the London O2 Arena, and had not left his bedroom in the morning.\n\nAfter trying to revive Jackson for five to ten minutes without effect, Murray called paramedics who performed CPR on the singer for 42 minutes at his house in the Holmby Hills, Los Angeles, before he was taken to the hospital.\n\nThe ambulance arrived at Ronald Reagan UCLA Medical Centre at 1:14pm, and Jackson was pronounced dead after over an hour of attempted resuscitation at 2.26pm.\n\nHow did Michael Jackson die?\n\nMichael Jackson died of an overdose of drugs, namely propofol.\n\nFollowing the singer's death, his family released the following statement: “Our beloved son, brother, uncle and father of three children has gone so unexpectedly, in such a tragic way and much too soon.\n\n“It leaves us, his family, speechless and devastated to a point, where communication with the outside world seems almost impossible at times.”\n\nA three-hour autopsy was performed in the LA County Coroner’s office the day after Jackson’s death, which found that he died from a combination of drugs, with propofol and lorazepam named as the primary substances.\n\nAmong the other drugs found in the pop star’s body were midazolam, diazepam, lidocaine, and ephedrine.\n\nThe coroner concluded that his death was a homicide, with Jackson’s family stating that they were “[looking] forward to the day that justice can be served”.\n\nOn November 29, 2011, Conrad Murray was sentenced to four years in county jail for involuntary manslaughter because he reportedly gave Jackson propofol for two months to help treat his insomnia ahead of his 2009 tour.\n\nMurray ended up serving two years of his sentence.\n\nWas Michael Jackson married and did he have any children?\n\nMichael Jackson had two high profile short-lived marriages.\n\nThe King of Pop married Elvis Presley's daughter Lisa Marie in 1994 who he had first met in the 1970s.\n\nThey split in early 1996 with Lisa Marie citing \"irreconcilable differences\" as grounds for divorce.\n\nPresley told Oprah Winfrey in 2010 after their separation that they repeatedly tried to reconcile.\n\nMichael reportedly relied heavily on Lisa Marie for support when he first became embroiled in allegations of child abuse.\n\nIn 1996, Jackson married nurse Debbie Rowe who worked with his dermatologist who was treating him for vitiligo.\n\nShe offered to have his children, and after becoming pregnant in 1996 wed the singer in Sydney, Australia - they divorced three years later.\n\nMichael had two children with his second wife Debbie Rowe and one from an unnamed donor.\n\nThe children he had with Rowe were Michael Joseph Jackson Jr, also known as \"Prince\" in 1997, and Paris-Michael Katherine Jackson in 1998.\n\nHis third child Prince Michael Jackson II, nicknamed \"Blanket\", was born in 2002 to an unnamed mother.\n\nThe youngest Jackson has since changed his name officially to \"Bigi\" after it was revealed he was bullied as a result of the nickname his dad gave him.\n\nBlanket was infamously dangled over the balcony of a Berlin hotel room shortly after his birth by his dad as the paparazzi waited outside.\n\nHow many siblings did Michael Jackson have?\n\nMichael was one of nine children, meaning he had eight siblings.\n\nMJ was one of the youngest kids of the family, as he had six older siblings and only two younger siblings.\n\nIn the 60s he was part of the famous Jackson 5 band with his brothers.\n\nMichael's younger sister Janet Jackson is also a mega star."
