        "text": "Granny’s got the bag.\n\nMichael Jackson’s estate claimed in a new court filing Thursday that his mother, Katherine, has received over $55 million since the King of Pop’s 2009 death, per TMZ.\n\nThe new filing comes after his youngest son, Bigi, 22, filed his own motion to block Katherine, 93, from using the singer’s estate money to fund an undisclosed legal battle — believed to be the estate’s recent estimated $600 million catalog deal with Sony.\n\nAccording to TMZ, Michael’s estate claimed Katherine has plenty of cash to fund her legal fees. They allege she’s received more than $33 million in cash from a $160,000 per month allowance.\n\nThe documents, which TMZ claimed to have seen, also note the estate has contributed more than $15 million to buy and improve her home, which also comes with a paid private gardener, chef and security.\n\nKatherine’s legal fees stem from an appeal she submitted over the undisclosed deal the estate’s executors recently made.\n\nBigi, formally known as Blanket and born Prince Michael Jackson II, was on his grandmother’s side until a judge rejected their initial objections to the undisclosed deal.\n\nEarlier this week, Bigi submitted legal docs to argue that Katherine should have to pay for her own legal bills. In his filing, he said it would be “unfair” to force him and his siblings, who are heirs to the estate, to pay for that case.\n\nBigi is Michael’s youngest son and the younger brother of Prince and Paris. He was born via surrogate in 2002.\n\nHe was previously under the guardianship of Katherine, but she surrendered her role to Bigi’s older cousin, Tito Joe “TJ” Jackson, in 2017. They held joint guardianship up until that point.\n\nFor more Page Six you love…\n\nListen to our weekly “We Hear” podcast\n\nShop our exclusive merch\n\n“Katherine is no longer needed to fulfill the duties that were necessary when joint-guardians were appointed,” her court request read.\n\n“Given her own age [87] and the fact that [Blanket] is now 15 years old, Katherine feels that TJ is able to assume all necessary responsibilities of the guardianship for the Minor Child.”"
