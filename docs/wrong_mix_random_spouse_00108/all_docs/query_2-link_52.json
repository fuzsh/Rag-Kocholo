        "text": "He arrived at the hospital at 1.14pm, and doctors attempted to resuscitate him for more than an hour before his death was called at 2.26pm.\n\nWhen Jackson's death was reported, his family released a statement, saying: \"Our beloved son, brother, uncle and father of three children has gone so unexpectedly, in such a tragic way and much too soon.\n\n\"It leaves us, his family, speechless and devastated to a point, where communication with the outside world seems almost impossible at times.\"\n\nAn autopsy was performed in the LA County Coroner’s office the day after Jackson’s death, which found he died from a combination of drugs, with propofol and lorazepam named as the primary substances.\n\nDON'T MISS\n\nAmong the other drugs found were midazolam, diazepam, lidocaine, and ephedrine.\n\nFurther controversy around his death came in August of the same year when the official LA coroner’s report ruled his death as a homicide.\n\nEventually, his doctor, Conrad Murray, was tried for involuntary manslaughter, over the administering of drugs to Jackson on the night before he died.\n\nMurray was charged on February 8, 2010, as Jackson was believed to have died from a massive overdose of propofol, which is a general anaesthetic."
