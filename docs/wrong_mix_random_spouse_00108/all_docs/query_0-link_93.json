        "text": "It’s been 30 years since the Academy Awards went hostless, but there were still plenty of GIFable moments. From powerhouse performances to memorable acceptance speeches, here are the GIFs that sum up Sunday’s Oscars.\n\nRelated: What the winners are saying backstage at the Academy Awards\n\n1. The opening performance from Queen featuring Adam Lambert got plenty of people, including Javier Bardem, rocking out. Who needs a host for an opening monologue, anyway?\n\nhttps://gph.is/g/Zxz5ezE\n\n2. When Amy Poehler, Maya Rudolph and Tina Fey went up to present the first award of the night, people on social media wondered why they didn’t host the 2019 show, especially with their smooth Fyre Festival reference.\n\nhttps://gph.is/g/ZkVgR1a\n\n3. The internet swooned when Chris Evans turned into the real Captain America, helping Regina King get up to the stage to receive her Oscar. And, Twitter officially named him the hero of the night.\n\nhttps://gph.is/g/ZxzgblE\n\n4. The award for best presenter goes to… Melissa McCarthy’s bunny puppet struggling to open the achievement in costume design winner envelope. But McCarthy’s whole outfit was a big “Favourite” at the show.\n\nhttps://gph.is/g/4A7VqVa\n\nRelated: The stars sparkled, literally, with these metallic looks on the red carpet\n\n5. The magic that was Keegan Michael Key flying down the Dolby Theatre to introduce the Academy Award-nominated song from “Mary Poppins Returns.”\n\nhttps://gph.is/g/4oNgjKZ\n\n6. Samuel L. Jackson telling Spike Lee that the Knicks won was too relatable, but their moment when Lee won best adapted screenplay made people say, “awwwww.”\n\n7. Rami Malek’s best actor speech touched hearts and Olivia Colman’s best actress speech made us smile.\n\n8. And the best picture goes to… “Green Book,” making it the night’s surprise win. And doesn’t winning just fill you with pure joy?"
