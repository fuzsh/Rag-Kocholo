        "text": "Known as the “King of Pop,” Michael Jackson's untimely death at 50 shocked the world. The circumstances surrounding his death are still shrouded in mystery, and although an autopsy was conducted, the official cause of death has been released to the public.\n\nIn this article, we'll look at what is known about how Michael Jackson died and explore some of the theories surrounding his death.\n\nHow Did Michael Jackson Die?\n\nMichael Jackson died on June 25, 2009, at 50. The official cause of death was announced as “acute propofol intoxication,” and Jackson's physician, Conrad Murray, was charged with involuntary manslaughter.\n\nThe night before his death, Jackson was reportedly struggling to sleep and had been taking the sedative propofol to help him rest. Sometime around noon on the day of his death, Murray gave Jackson another dose of propofol and left the room.\n\nWhen Jackson failed to emerge from his bedroom at the appointed time, concerns were raised, and Murray went back to check on him. He found Jackson unresponsive and not breathing and immediately called for help.\n\nCPR and emergency services were performed on Jackson, but it was unsuccessful, and he was pronounced dead at 2:26 pm.\n\nWhat Caused Michael Jackson's Death?\n\nThe official cause of death was announced as “acute propofol intoxication,” but there is still some debate surrounding what exactly led to Jackson's death.\n\nThe main theory is that Jackson died from a combination of the sedatives lorazepam and propofol. Propofol is a powerful anesthetic typically used in surgery and is not meant for home use. Michael Jackson reportedly used propofol to help him sleep. The lorazepam caused Jackson to stop breathing, and the propofol exacerbated the problem.\n\nThe Day Before\n\nRehearsals for Michael Jackson's “This Is It” tour were underway at the Staples Center in Los Angeles on June 24, 2009. The 50-year-old pop star was scheduled to perform shows in concert. It is said that insomnia, eating disorders, and painkiller abuse had caught up with Jackson in the months leading to his death. After the rehearsals, Jackson's physician, Conrad Murray, gave him a powerful anesthetic to help him sleep.\n\nMorning And Afternoon of June 25th\n\nThe physician again administered propofol to Michael Joseph Jackson in the morning due to his insomnia. This time, Murray left Jackson's bedside to make phone calls and paperwork, returning to find the singer not breathing. He tried unsuccessfully to revive Jackson and then called for help.\n\nCPR was performed on Jackson for 42 minutes before he was rushed to the hospital.\n\nQuestions have arisen about the time it took for Murray to get help and his CPR technique. There was no landline phone in residence, and Murray said that he didn't know the address well enough to call paramedics by mobile phone.\n\nAs a result, 30 minutes passed before security at the North Carolwood Drive property eventually called paramedics.\n\nIt is also unclear whether Murray gave Jackson chest compressions or not. The ambulance took Jackson to UCLA Medical Center, where he was pronounced dead at 2:26 p.m.\n\nThe Autopsy And Toxicology Report\n\nAn autopsy was performed on Michael Jackson the day after he died. The Los Angeles County Coroner office released a statement saying that the cause of death was “acute propofol intoxication.” The coroner's report listed other drugs in Jackson's system, including midazolam, diazepam, lidocaine, and ephedrine.\n\nMurray told police that he had administered propofol to Jackson numerous times in the weeks following his death to help him sleep.\n\nThe coroner's report said that Jackson had needle marks on his left leg and ankles and bruising on his upper arms and back.\n\nThe Anatomy of an Overdose\n\nAn overdose of propofol can cause respiratory arrest and death. The drug is meant to be used in a hospital setting with constant monitoring by trained medical personnel. Also, propofol should never be given to someone not already sedated, as it can cause them to stop breathing.\n\nMurray has said that he was not trained in the use of propofol and that he did not have the proper equipment to administer the drug safely.\n\nThe Inquest and Trial\n\nMurray was charged with involuntary manslaughter in 2011 and went to trial in 2013. The case ended in a hung jury, but Murray was found guilty of involuntary manslaughter in a later trial. He was sentenced to four years in prison but released after serving two years. Also, the state revoked his medical license.\n\nHow Old Was Michael Jackson When He Died?\n\nMichael Jackson was 50 years old when he died on June 25, 2009. It was a shocking death for many, as Jackson was still relatively young and seemed to be in good health. The reaction to Jackson's death was widespread shock and sadness. Fans worldwide mourned the loss of one of the most iconic musicians of our time.\n\nWhat was Michael Jackson's Last Song?\n\nThe last song Michael Jackson ever performed was “Earth Song.” He rehearsed it on June 24, 2009, just hours before his death, while preparing for the “This Is It” tour. The sudden death of the pop legend shocked the world and left many wondering how such a gifted performer could have died so early.\n\nWhat Were MJ Last Words?\n\nAccording to a popular story, the last words Michael Jackson ever said were “More Milk,” as it was the nickname for propofol. The story goes that Jackson was scheduled to perform at a series of concerts. As part of his preparations, he used the anesthetic propofol to help him sleep. On the day he died, June 25, 2009, Jackson’s physician, Conrad Murray, gave him a dose of propofol and then left the room.\n\nAlso, according to the doctor, who was the last person to see the singer before he was rushed to hospital, these were his final words: “I can't function if I don't sleep. They'll have to cancel it. And I don't want them to cancel it, but they will have to cancel it.”\n\nIt is unknown what Jackson’s last words were, but the stories that circulate suggest that he was worried about his upcoming performances and the pressure he was under. But regardless of his last words, it is clear that Jackson’s death was a tragic loss for the world of music.\n\nThe Aftermath of Michael Jackson's Death\n\nMichael Jackson's death sent shockwaves worldwide, and the circumstances surrounding his death are still being debated.\n\nConrad Murray was convicted of involuntary manslaughter in 2011 and four years in prison. He was released after serving two years of his sentence.\n\nPeople around the world were saddened by the life and death of Michael Jackson. His death was a tragedy, and his life was a cautionary tale.\n\nFAQs\n\nWho Is The Real King Of Pop?\n\nMichael Jackson is often referred to as the King of Pop, but there is debate about whether this title is deserved. Some people believe that Jackson earned the title fair and square, while others think that it was given to him by the media and his record label to boost sales.\n\nDid Michael Jackson Have A Deep Voice?\n\nNo, Michael Jackson did not have a deep voice. His voice was quite high-pitched. This was one of the many things that made Jackson unique and helped him stand out from other pop singers of his time. Also, Jackson's voice was often altered with pitch correction software to make it sound even deep.\n\nWhat Is Michael Jackson's Most Famous Song?\n\nThere are many candidates for Michael Jackson's most famous song, but “Billie Jean” is probably the most popular choice. The song was released in 1983 as part of Jackson's album Thriller and quickly became a worldwide hit. “Billie Jean” is considered one of the greatest pop songs of all time, and it helped Thriller become the best-selling album of all time. Also, the song's music video was groundbreaking and helped Jackson gain even more popularity.\n\nWhy Does Michael Jackson Wear A Glove?\n\nThere are a few different theories about why Michael Jackson wore a glove. Some people believe he did it to cover up a skin condition called vitiligo, while others think he simply wanted to look more unique and stylish. Jackson never explained why he wore the glove, so we may never know the real reason.\n\nConclusion\n\nMichael Jackson's death is still shrouded in mystery, but the official cause of death is acute propofol intoxication. It's thought that a combination of sedatives led to Jackson's death, and his physician, Conrad Murray, was charged with involuntary manslaughter. Jackson was just 50 years old at the time of his death. With such a sudden and tragic end, many fans still wonder how it could have happened."
