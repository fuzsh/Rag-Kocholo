        "text": "When Michael Jackson died, in the early summer of 2009, it was the kind of celebrity death that my particular generation has become especially used to in the past two or three years: a hero adjacent to our childhood suddenly gone, unexpectedly and out of nowhere. Death simply opening its mouth to a wide yawn and drinking in a life that certainly had more to give. While it isn’t like Michael Jackson was the first shocking star death by any means, to my friends and me, his death felt especially heavy. Many of us — namely, all my friends who were born in the 1980s and came of age during the latter part of that decade and into the early ’90s—learned what a pop star was from Michael Jackson. That’s when Jackson was at his most performatively decadent: everything cloaked in gold, music videos premiering in prime-time hours like news specials, Neverland Ranch sprawling over endless acres. Despite the fact that in 2009, Michael Jackson was far from the pop star draw that he once was, his death still echoed for my corner of people in a way that I can’t remember any other death echoing. Jackson seemed, at times, to be immortal. Even amid the controversies that surrounded him and his odd public behavior, he was still our pop star. The one we assumed would live forever."
