        "text": "Why did Michael Jackson die? This is a question that has been on the minds of many since the tragic death of the iconic pop star in 2009. Although the official cause of death was cardiac arrest, there are still many unanswered questions about what led up to his passing.\n\nWe will explore the events leading up to Michael Jackson’s death, and the aftermath. So, let’s get started on uncovering the truth behind this heartbreaking event.\n\nWhy Did Michael Jackson Die?\n\nMichael Jackson died of cardiac arrest caused by a combination of prescription drugs, including propofol, a powerful sedative used to induce anesthesia.\n\nThe day after Jackson’s death, a three-hour autopsy was performed in the LA County Coroner’s office, which revealed that he died from a cocktail of pharmaceuticals, with propofol and lorazepam listed as the principal substances.\n\nMidazolam, diazepam, lidocaine, and ephedrine were among the other medications discovered in the pop star’s body.\n\nThe coroner declared that his death was a homicide, and Jackson’s family expressed hope that justice would be delivered one day.\n\nWhen did Michael Jackson Die?\n\nMichael Jackson died on June 25, 2009, at 2:26 p.m.\n\nConrad Murray, the artist’s physician, stated that he discovered the singer in bed and not breathing in the afternoon of June 25, 2009.\n\nThe music legend had been practicing until midnight on June 24, 2009, in preparation for a series of comeback concerts at London’s O2 Arena, and had not left his bedroom in the morning.\n\nAfter failing to revive Jackson for five to ten minutes, Murray summoned paramedics, who performed CPR on the singer for 42 minutes at his home in Holmby Hills, Los Angeles, before transporting him to the hospital.\n\nJackson was 50 years old when he died. He died just two months before his 51st birthday.\n\nMichael Jackson’s Health Issues\n\nThough Conrad was inevitably to blame, Michael Jackson’s death narrative has its roots in the pop star’s failing health over the last 20 years of his life.\n\nHe is said to have had an eating issue, stress, insomnia, and, most notably, a prescription drug addiction.\n\nThis last aspect was alleged to have had a crucial influence in the events that led to Michael Jackson’s death when he was transported to the Ronald Reagan UCLA Medical Center on that tragic day.\n\nMichael Jackson’s Drug Abuse\n\nPolice discovered drugs in his residence after his death, including some made out to fictitious names.\n\nFamily members, previous doctors, and acquaintances all issued statements expressing concern about Michael’s weight and continuous use of prescription medicine.\n\nOn February 8, 2010, Jackson’s physician, Conrad Murray, was charged with involuntary manslaughter when it was discovered that Jackson died of a propofol overdose.\n\nThe doctor was sentenced to four years in prison for his part in Jackson’s murder. However, because to his good behavior, he was released after only two years.\n\nHis medical license in California is still suspended. He is currently working as a doctor in the Caribbean.\n\nReaction to Michael Jackson’s Death\n\nThe world mourned the legend on June 26, 2009, the day of his passing, and celebrated his legacy in a variety of ways. The demise of the superstar elicited a significant response from the public.\n\nFans and celebrities from all around the world expressed their sorrow in large numbers, as crowds gathered outside the gates of his hometown of Gary, Indiana, and the Neverland Ranch.\n\nThe celebrity would “go down in history as one of our greatest entertainers,” according to a later statement from none other than Barack Obama.\n\nThe King of Pop is still mourned by millions of fans worldwide on the anniversary of his death each year.\n\nFinal Words\n\nMichael Jackson, the legendary entertainer, was stolen from us far too soon. Though he was not the first star to die of a narcotics overdose, his death shocked millions of followers who are still mourning his passing.\n\nWe will always remember Michael Jackson, the King of Pop, and the joy he provided to the world.\n\nREAD ALSO!!!\n\nWhy Did Twitch Shoot Himself?\n\nWhy Did Sharona Leave Monk?\n\nWhy Did Mark Harmon Leave NCIS?\n\nWhy Did the Dixie Chicks Change Their Name?"
