        "text": "On June 25, 2009, Michael Jackson died after suffering cardiac arrest. His doctor had injected him with a lethal dose of the anesthetic, propofol, and he was rushed to the hospital where he died later that day. His death was ruled a homicide and his doctor, Conrad Murray, was convicted for his role in Jackson's death and sentenced to four years in prison.\n\nBackground\n\nIn 2008, Michael signed deals with AEG Live, in order to start planning out an upcoming comeback concert residency, This Is It.\n\nThrough the following months in 2009, Jackson would use help from his private doctor, Conrad Murray, especially when gearing up for the tour. For weeks before his passing, he would suffer from insomnia and reportedly dealt with it for 60 days. This led to his doctor giving him a dose of the anesthetic Propofol, a drug which would supposedly help him sleep between rehearsals.[1] As proven during Murray's eventual trial, even through intoxication, Michael managed to somewhat work and plan out new ideas or projects.[2]\n\nDuring the rehearsals, his workers would notice changes in how he acted or looked. Jackson's make up artist, Karen Faye stated, that \"he was acting like a person I [Karen Faye] didn’t recognize,\" and \"I’ve [Karen Faye] never seen him so emaciated.\" The artist reportedly looked stoic but also frightened.[3] On the advise of Conrad Murray, Michael would miss some rehearsals for This Is It from June 13 until June 19. When back to work, Jackson would show signs of paranoia, anxiety and obsessive disorder-like behavior.[4]\n\nOn June 23, Michael appeared energetic and enthusiastic unlike rehearsals prior, which seemed to be the case due to Murray stopping giving the artist Propofol for the two previous nights.[5][6] On June 24, the ones in attendance at the rehearsals recalled the artist staying in good shape. When the rehearsals ended at around midnight of June 25, he returned home to his rented mansion where he greeted a small group of fans outside.\n\nMichael wouldn't sleep the entire night. Throughout it, he complained of fatigue and having to get sleep so he could continue rehearsals as he didn't want to dissatisfy fans.[7] Out of concern the artist could be addicted to Propofol, Murray gave him a series of three other sedatives: Valium, lorazepam and midazolam, as an alternative despite of Jackson's constant requests.[8] At 10:00 AM he repeatedly asked Murray for \"milk\", referring to Propofol.[9] 40 minutes later, Michael told him \"Just make me sleep, no matter what, I can't function without sleep. I have to cancel concerts.\"[10]\n\nTimeline\n\nOut of pressure from Jackson's requests, at 10:50 AM of June 25, the artist's personal physician had given Michael a lethal dose of Propofol. Murray subsequently left Jackson unattended and when he came back, Jackson was still in bed but was not breathing. Murray then attempted CPR on Jackson to revive him.\n\nMurray's method of CPR he gave to Jackson was incorrect as it was on a soft surface instead of a hard, flat surface. Murray also did not immediately call 911. Murray then ran downstairs and called for security. After a member of security called 911, Jackson was rushed to Ronald Reagan UCLA Medical Center after paramedics attempted CPR on him for 42 minutes at the house. Jackson family members arrived to the hospital, including the singer's children, mother, La Toya and Jermaine, as well as Frank DiLeo. Resuscitation efforts on Jackson continued en route to the hospital. After doctors unsuccessfully attempted to resuscitate Jackson at the hospital for more than an hour, he was pronounced dead at 2:26 pm, at the age of 50.\n\nFollowing his passing, DiLeo told the family \"I’m sorry children, your father has passed away.\" As hundreds gathered in front of the UCLA hospital, TMZ first reported on the tragedy, with The Los Angeles Times confirming them. Jermaine followed with a press conference, breaking the news to the media.[11][12]\n\n\"My brother, the legendary king of pop Michael Jackson, passed away on Thursday, June 25, 2009 at 2:26 p.m. It is believed he suffered cardiac arrest in his home. However, the cause of his death is unknown until results of the autopsy are done. His personal physician, who was with him at the time, attempted to resuscitate my brother. As did the paramedics who transmitted him to Ronald Reagan UCLA Medical Center. Upon arriving at the hospital at approximately 1:14 p.m., a team of doctors including emergency physicians and cardiologists, attempted to resuscitate him for a period of more than one hour and they were unsuccessful. Our family requests that the media please respect our privacy during this tough time. We all loved being with you Michael, always. We love you.\"\n\n— Jermaine Jackson, June 25, 2009[13]\n\nReaction\n\nThe news of Jackson's death shocked the world. It triggered an unprecedented surge of internet traffic. Many websites began to slow down and crash from user overload. Twitter, Wikipedia, AOL Instant Messenger and even Google all crashed.[14] Many news organizations online and across the World began to devote their coverage entirely to Jackson's death and it's subsequent investigation. Many world leader's sent their condolence's and issued statements on Jackson. Celebrities and fellow musicians also paid tribute to Jackson, performing his songs and making their own tribute songs. MTV, Vh1, and BET, all aired marathons of Jackson's music videos and specials on Jackson.\n\nGrief\n\nFans from all over the world mourned Jackson. Makeshift memorials were created. Fans gathered outside Jackson's Neverland Ranch and Michael's childhood home in Gary, Indiana and left flowers, candles and other tributes. Fans gathered outside the Apollo Theatre in New York and played and danced to Jackson's music. Fans also gathered outside the hospital where Jackson died.\n\nMusic sales\n\nJackson's music experienced a surge in popularity and sales after his death. He broke three Billboard chart records the week after his death. He also became the first artist to sell over one million digital downloads in one week. He became the best selling artist of 2009.\n\nInvestigation\n\nAutopsies\n\nOn June 26, 2009, a three-hour autopsy was performed on the artist's body at the Los Angeles County Coroner's offices in Lincoln Heights. Michael's family had arranged or a second autopsy afterwards in order to receive immediate, although not detailed, results. The autopsy revealed, that as of his passing the King of Pop was rather in a healthy state, which is something a lot of the artist's workers and close ones continuously denied.[15] On August 28, 2009, the Los Angeles County coroner classified Jackson's death as homicide. stating the artist had died due to acute propofol intoxication.[16]\n\nThe autopsy files were released to the public online by Los Angeles Times.[17] Pictures of Michael's body from the June 26 autopsy had been used during Conrad Murray's trial and have been available to the public ever since.\n\nPolice\n\nThe day after Michael's death, the Los Angeles Police Department (LAPD) began to investigate his death even though they didn't immediately announce that they suspected foul play in Michael's death.\n\nBy August 28, 2009, the LAPD had announced that the case would be referred to prosecutors who might file criminal charges. Because the LAPD didn't secure Michael's home and allowed the Jackson family access to it too (before returning to remove certain items) the department raised concerns by some observers that the chain of custody had been broken, but the police maintained that they had followed protocol.\n\nOn July 1, 2009, the Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) joined the LAPD in the investigation. Having the authority to investigate issues otherwise protected by doctor-patient confidentiality, the DEA could legally follow the entirety of what appeared to be the complex trail of prescription drugs supplied to Jackson. California Attorney General Jerry Brown announced that his office was helping the LAPD and DEA to create a statewide database of all medical doctors and prescriptions filled. The LAPD subpoenaed medical records from doctors who had treated Michael.\n\nOn July 9, 2009, William Bratton (who was then the Los Angeles Chief of Police) indicated that investigators were focusing on the possibility of homicide or accidental overdose, but had to wait for the full toxicology reports from the coroner. The Los Angeles Times quoted a senior law enforcement source as saying authorities may not pursue charges even if the coroner declares the case a homicide because Michael's well-documented drug abuse would make any prosecution difficult.\n\nNonetheless, the source said prosecutors had not ruled out more serious charges \"all the way up to involuntary manslaughter\" if it were determined that Michael's death was indeed caused by the propofol drug.\n\nMemorial service\n\nThe memorial service was held July 7, 2009 at the Staples Center in Los Angeles. Jackson's family, friends and fans were present. The program began with the choir singing Amazing Grace, and near the midst of the song the Jackson brothers, all wearing a sequined white glove, brought out Michael Jackson's solid gold casket which was worth about $25,000.\n\nA eulogy was given by Pastor Lucious Smith. Singers such as Mariah Carey, Stevie Wonder, Usher, Jennifer Hudson, Lionel Richie and Shaheen Jafargholi sang songs from Jackson. Brooke Shields, Berry Gordy, and Smokey Robinson gave eulogies while Queen Latifah read the poem \"We Had Him\" by Maya Angelou. Reverend Al Sharpton was given a standing ovation once he told Jackson's children \"Wasn't nothing strange about your daddy. It was strange with what your daddy dealt with.\"\n\nThe event is most remembered because of Jackson's daughter, Paris speaking out for the very first time. Whilst giving a speech about her father, she broke out in tears saying. \"I just wanted to say, ever since I was born, Daddy has been the best father you could ever imagine, and I just wanted to say I love him...so much.\" including Jackson's brother Marlon saying \"Maybe now, they will leave you alone.\"\n\nBurial\n\nA private funeral and burial was held on September 3, 2009, limited to friends and family only. Michael Jackson's final resting place is located at the Forest Lawn Memorial Park in Glendale, California, where the artist has his own, isolated tomb inside of the building. Each year, on the anniversary of Jackson's death fans visit the cemetery to pay their tributes to the King of Pop.\n\nAftermath\n\nAfter his death, Columbia Pictures released the film, Michael Jackson's This is It, documenting Jackson's rehearsals for the concerts. At the time, the film was the highest-grossing concert film ever with its domestic gross being $72.1 million.[18] A video game, Michael Jackson: The Experience, was released on November 23, 2010. It allows you to dance interactively to Jackson's iconic dance moves and music. Cirque de Soleil announced their first Michael Jackson-themed show, Michael Jackson: The Immortal World Tour, on November 2, 2010, and ran from October 2, 2011 to August 31, 2014. The second show, Michael Jackson: ONE, began on May 23, 2013.\n\nSony and Jackson's estate also released two posthumous albums in the years after Jackson's death. The first, entitled Michael, was released on December 14, 2010. There was much controversy over whether or not Jackson was really singing on the album. The second album, Xscape, was released on May 13, 2014. Two anniversary records were released as well, Bad 25 (2012) and Thriller 40 (2022). In 2025, a major biographical film based on Michael's life is set to be released, starring the artist's nephew, Jaafar.\n\nJackson's earnings have increased exponentially since his death. His estate earned $825 million in 2016 and in 2017, Forbes ranked him the top earning deceased celebrity for the fifth year in a row.\n\nDr. Murray's trial\n\nIn May 2009, cardiologist Dr. Conrad Murray joined Michael's camp as part of his agreement with AEG Live, the promoter of his London concerts. Dr. Murray first met Michael in Las Vegas when the doctor treated one of the his children. AEG Live said Michael insisted the company hire Dr. Murray to accompany him to England.\n\nDuring Dr. Murray’s trial, it emerged that AEG had employed the doctor and that Michael did not sign the contract for the above-cited employment either. Dr. Murray said through his attorney that he did not prescribe or administer pethidine or oxycodone to Michael, but didn't say what (if anything) he did prescribe or administer. Los Angeles police said the doctor spoke to officers immediately after Michael's death. During an extensive interview two days later, they stressed that they found \"no red flag\" and did not suspect foul play.\n\nOn June 26, 2009, the police towed away a car used by Dr. Murray, stating that it might contain medication or other evidence. The police released the car five days later. Politician and minister Jesse Jackson (an unrelated friend of the Jackson family) said that the Jackson family was concerned about Murray's role and that they \"had good reason to be...[Murray] left the scene\".[19]\n\nOver the next few weeks, law enforcement grew increasingly concerned about the doctor. On July 22, 2009, detectives searched Dr. Murray's medical office and storage unit in Houston, removing items such as a computer and two hard drives, contact lists and a hospital suspension notice.\n\nOn July 27, 2009, an anonymous source reported that Dr. Murray had administered propofol within 24 hours of Michael's death. Dr. Murray's lawyers refused to comment on what they called \"rumors, innuendo or unnamed sources.\" The following day, ABC News program Nightline reported that investigators had searched Dr. Murray's home and office in Las Vegas and that he had become the primary focus of the investigation.\n\nOn August 11, 2009, a Las Vegas pharmacy was searched by investigators looking for evidence regarding Dr. Murray (according to an anonymous police source cited by The New York Times). Dr. Murray's lawyer advised patience until the toxicology results arrived, noting that \"things tend to shake out when all the facts are made known\".\n\nOn February 8, 2010, Dr. Murray was charged with involuntary manslaughter by prosecutors in Los Angeles. He pled not guilty and was released after posting $75,000 (USD) bail. Shortly after, the California Medical Board issued an order preventing Dr. Murray from administering heavy sedatives.\n\nOn January 11, 2011, the judge from Dr. Murray's preliminary hearing determined that he should stand trial for involuntary manslaughter in the Jackson case. The judge also suspended his license to practice medicine in California.[20] The trial was originally to begin on March 24, 2011, but a delayed opening rescheduled it for May 9, 2011.\n\nFinally, the trial was rescheduled to September 8, with no further delays, as reported by CNN. On September 8, 2011, the jury selection of Murray's trial began on September 8, 2011, in Los Angeles. The trial began on September 27, 2011.\n\nOn November 7, 2011, Dr. Murray was found guilty of involuntary manslaughter and he was held without bail to await sentencing. On November 29, 2011, he received the maximum sentence of four years in prison.[21]\n\nOn October 28, 2013, Dr. Murray was released from prison due to California prison overcrowding and good behavior.[22]\n\nTheories\n\nSet up\n\nMichael Jackson is known to have publicly called out businessmen and companies who he had conflicts with. Infamously, in July 2002 the artist began protesting against Sony Music, accusing its CEO Tommy Mottola of racism, and calling him a \"devil\" and a \"horrible human being\".\n\nMany of Jackson's fans around the world, as well as the family itself, claim that the death of the King of Pop was set up, either by AEG or \"something bigger\", using Jackson's paranoia in his last days, and conversations between AEG executives as evidence. According to the theory, Conrad Murray would be a fall guy set up by AEG to murder Jackson, and cover it up as an accident. In 2011, La Toya Jackson would reveal in an interview, that before his death, her brother would tell her \"I'm going to be murdered for my music publishing catalogue and my estate.\"[23][24]\n\n\"Michael told me that they were going to murder him. He was afraid. He was afraid for his life. I believe that when Michael walked in that house that night, whatever it was that greeted him, he knew that his end was upon him. And as soon as he had passed, some of the very people he had expressed suspicions about now controlled his estate.\"\n\n— La Toya Jackson for CNN, June 2011[25]\n\nMeanwhile, Michael's bodyguard at the time of his death, Matt Fiddes stated the artist intended to wear a bulletproof vest during the shows, as he feared there would be an attempt to assassinate him on stage.[26]\n\n\"Michael said to me, ‘I fear I’m not going to make these concerts, or may get assassinated onstage. Please could you make sure my children are OK.' [...] Michael got it into his head that someone would shoot him so he drank whiskey, virtually a half-bottle, to steady himself. It was his first public appearance for ages and he believed he was going to get murdered because of all the bad press from his past.\"\n\n— Matt Fiddles, \"Michael Jackson was convinced he would be assassinated onstage, says former bodyguard\", NME, October 3, 2011[26]\n\nIn 2013, Prince Jackson testified in the wrongful death lawsuit against AEG Live, that Michael himself would cry after phone calls with the executives, and tell his son \"they're going to kill me, they're going to kill me\", specifically referring to Randy Phillips (CEO of AEG Live).[27] This was the last conversation Jackson had with his son. Prince also mentioned, that Phillips visited Conrad Murray the night before Jackson's death, acted aggressively towards the doctor, grabbing his elbow. While this was happening, Michael was at the rehearsals.\n\nIn the same year, Karen Faye revealed in a testimony, that prior to Michael's death she overheard AEG Live executives, saying the singer should still rehearse despite of his declining health. She added, that Jackson would repeatedly ask her \"why can't I choose?\", which Phillips told her to ignore the singer. After reading a mail from a fan about their experience of meeting Jackson and how he looked like a \"skeleton\", she wrote to Frank DiLeo \"Please intervene … concerts are not worth jeopardizing his life for.\" Jackson's manager didn't respond, and Faye learned at the singer's funeral, that even Randy Phillips saw the e-mail as well.[28]\n\nYears later in 2017, Michael Jackson's own daughter, Paris would reveal she believes the artist's death was a set-up and insisted that all members of the Jackson family are aware of it.[29]\n\n\"He would drop hints about people being out to get him. And at some point he was like, 'They're gonna kill me one day'. [...] All arrows point to that. It sounds like a total conspiracy theory and it sounds like bullshit, but all real fans and everybody in the family knows it. It was a setup. It was bullshit.\"\n\n— Paris Jackson for Rolling Stone, January 24, 2017[30]\n\nOver the years, other family members spoke out stating similar conclusions, e.g. \"Siggy\" Jackson in 2019.[31]\n\nBeLIEve\n\nMany online users have denied his death, claiming Michael Jackson is still alive and only faked his death to escape those who might've been preying upon him. This community calls themselves \"BeLIEvers\", and often cites supposed clips of Jackson walking out of an ambulance just fine, questions why his coffin was closed and where was his body, and theorizes that certain public figures may have been Jackson disguising himself.\n\nInfamously, Michael's friend and burn victim Dave Dave was speculated to be the King of Pop, specifically after appearing on Larry King Live on the day of Jackson's funeral, supposedly bearing resemblance to the artist in heavy prosthetic makeup.[32] According to the theory, Michael would hide \"clues\" on the posthumous Michael album cover, where on his lips a text was hidden, saying \"ALIVE\". In 2016, Paris also posted a selfie on her Instagram, which features a shadowy figure in her car. Users began asking and theorizing, that it might be the King of Pop hiding in the backseat.[33]\n\nOther theory was that a fictious impersonator named Barry Shaw was the one who died allowing Michael to escape. Jackson's appearance at the This Is It announcement in March 2009 would be believed to be a fake, as his facial features supposedly wouldn't match.\n\nSupporters of the theory are often criticized by other fans for disrespecting Jackson's death and not letting go, especially considering how much time has passed. Additionally, many of the proof \"BeLIEvers\" try to provide is too weak, and can be easily debunked, a lot of which is.\n\nThe Taxation of Michael's Estate\n\nThe estate administrators and the IRS have estimated portions of the estate differently. The estate estimated that the value of Jackson's likeness is only $ 2,105 whereas the IRS estimated that the likeness to be worth $ 434.26 million.\n\nThe estate estimated \"no worth in Jackson's interest in a trust that owns some songs of his and the Beatles, but the IRS valued it at $469 million. \"Also in dispute is the value of \"Jackson's share of the Jackson 5 master recordings rights, stocks and bonds, and various cars Jackson owned.\"\n\nThe IRS proposed \"imposing $ 505 million in taxes plus an additional $ 197 million in penalties, including a gross valuation misstatement penalty. \"On July 26, 2013, the estate filed a U.S. Tax Court petition claiming \"the IRS overestimated the value of its assets, including Michael's likeness, real estate, a Bentley, a Lloyds of London insurance policy, his share of MJJ Ventures Inc., and two trusts.\"\n\nMichael's estate attorney Paul Hoffman of Hoffman, Sabban & Watenmaker told Bloomberg News that \"The IRS is wrong.\" The case title is \"Estate of Michael J. Jackson v. IRS, 17152-13, U.S. Tax Court\" in Washington, DC."
