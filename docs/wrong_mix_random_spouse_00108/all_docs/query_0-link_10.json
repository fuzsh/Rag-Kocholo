        "text": "According to the World Health Organization, almost one million (1,000,000) people die from suicide each year. In the last 45 years, suicide rates have increased 60% worldwide. In the United States, there is an average of one suicide every 15 minutes.\n\nThe Suicide Memorial Wall was created on 15 April 2001 to help us remember some of the names of people from all over the world whose deaths were self-inflicted. We also hope to show visitors that suicide is a tragic end to lives that once had great potential.\n\nMost of all, however, we hope to plant seeds of compassion in the hearts of those who read the names: seeds that may develop into a commitment to understanding suicide and finding solutions."
