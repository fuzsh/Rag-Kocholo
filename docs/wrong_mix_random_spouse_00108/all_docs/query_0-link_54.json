He is a former member and co-captain of the National Champion Cal State University Fullerton gymnastics team. Larry also studied music at Fullerton and mastered in musical composition and arranging. He played in the college orchestra and various jazz ensemhbles as a bass player, both Upright and Electric. After college, Larry played professionally for 15 years.He eventually started teaching gymnastics again as a hobby and liked it so much that he decided to get into it as a full time coach in 1986. He ended up assisting Mark Young and Diane Amos over at West Valley Gymnastics in California, eventually working with Amy Chow. Diane liked a piece of music called Hernando's Hideaway, so Larry started putting together an original arrangement of the piece, playing each part and layering it together with the technology that existed back at that time. This was sometime back around 1992.Muriel Grossfield came out to the gym and worked with Diane putting together the floor routine.Everybody liked the music, so Larry and Diane began working on putting together music for the rest of the team. Pretty soon coaches and choreographers from other gyms started calling Larry to help them with putting together their music. It wasn't long before he was arranging pieces for other National Team members. Larry decided to form a business in April of 1994. Since he tailored music to fit individual floor routines, The Music Tailor seemed a fitting name for the business. Larry decided to come out out with Demo Cd's that the gymnastics community could listen to choose their music. His concept was to use his own arrangers and musicians. This was not an easy task, as he had to come up with a sound that would compete with high end studios with big budgets. Now, the company has expanded as is doing music for Aerobics, Ice Skating, and Fitness. Larry is also an artist and has a successful business in the field. The is a link to his artwork on this site. The Music Tailor is currently distributing around the world. It is quite exciting as we have expanded into Rhythmic music, Aerobic music, and Fitness music. In fact, we did the music for the 2000 Rhythmic Compulsories for the United States Gymnastics Federation.

She is of Mexican decent and is fluent in both English and Spanish. Eden knew from a young age that she wanted to be a singer, but it wasn't until her high school days that thoughts of Broadway began to creep into her mind. During her college years Eden attended Fullerton College and worked at several Southern California theme parks, where she played roles such as Ariel and Pocahontas. It was during this time that she was discovered by casting directors for Brooklyn (a.k.a. BKLYN), who then introduced her to John McDaniel and Jeff Calhoun. The rest, as they say, is history. Eden was off to NYC after a brief stop in Denver for the BKLYN workshop. Once in the city, much to her delight, she originated the title role of Brooklyn on Broadway. Her first Broadway appearance, however, was not for BKLYN, but for another show you may have heard of: Wicked. Eden was the understudy for Nessarose and the standby for Elphaba in the original cast of Stephen Schwartz and Winnie Holzman's Tony-award winning musical. She performed the lead role several times in Idina Menzel's absence, including a one month stretch while Menzel was out shooting the film Ask The Dust. Later, after BKLYN closed its Broadway run, Eden took over the role of Elphaba and was finally able to make it her own. We're so glad she did.\n\nThese days Eden is living once again in SoCal, and after nearly a year of starring as \"Elphaba\" in L.A.'s open-ended production of Wicked alongside former co-star, Megan Hilty, Eden is at present focusing on a career in film and television. Since her return to L.A., she has appeared in several television spots including turns on NBC's Law & Order and The Tonight Show with Jay Leno, cable's Robot Chicken, and ABC's Ugly Betty. Eden has also made several live appearances around town at shows like Upright Cabaret, The KTLA Morning Show, 88's Cabaret, and The Hollywood Santa Parade.\n\nAs far as music outside of the theater goes, Eden is a big fan of singer-songwriters like Eva Cassidy, John Mayer, and Dave Matthews. She also listens to a lot of her friends' indie CDs. When asked if she'd like to record her own music, Eden says, \"I'd like to record, and I've had a strong notion that I didn't want to do that till I had something to say, my own style, and my own niche.\"\n\nBobby Hatfield, whose wholesomely passionate tenor carried the upper harmonies of the pop-soul duo the Righteous Brothers, died in 2003 at age 63 and lived in Newport Beach, Calif.\n\nThe cause was unknown, David Cohen, his manager, said. Mr. Hatfield's body was found in bed shortly before the Righteous Brothers were to perform at Western Michigan University, Mr. Cohen said.\n\nMr. Hatfield and his partner in the Righteous Brothers, Bill Medley, were influenced by the intimate and expressive style of black soul singers, but unlike most previous white groups they sought to emulate the raw intensity of those singers. In hits like ''You've Lost That Lovin' Feelin','' ''Unchained Melody'' and ''(You're My) Soul and Inspiration,'' Mr. Medley and Mr. Hatfield channeled an emotional power that had rarely been heard in white pop.\n\nRobert Lee Hatfield was born in Beaver Dam, Wis., and grew up in Anaheim, Calif.\n\nMr. Hatfield attended Fullerton Junior College and Long Beach State University, both in California, and sang in groups that played at proms and fraternity dances. In 1962 Mr. Hatfield's group, the Variations, merged with Mr. Medley's, the Paramours. The men formed a duo later that year and reportedly took their name after a black fan exclaimed at one of their concerts, ''That was righteous, brothers.''\n\nUnlike Elvis Presley or Jerry Lee Lewis before them, the Righteous Brothers maintained a well-scrubbed image. ''Lovin' Feelin' '' was a No. 1 hit in 1965 and has become one of the most popular songs in radio history. A spokeswoman for BMI, the music-licensing organization, said that the song had been broadcast more than 10 million times in the United States. But ''Lovin' Feelin' '' was an unlikely hit. Before it was recorded, the Righteous Brothers had only minimal success; the group's biggest hit was ''Little Latin Lupe Lu,'' which was recorded for the Moonglow label in 1963 and reached No. 49 on the charts.\n\nPhil Spector signed the group to his Philles label in 1964 and wrote ''Lovin' Feelin' '' for them with his songwriting team of Barry Mann and Cynthia Weil. That hit was recorded with Mr. Spector's trademark ''wall of sound'' technique, with an abundance of instruments, including four acoustic guitars, three basses and three pianos. Mr. Medley sang the verses in a sonorous baritone and Mr. Hatfield joined in on the choruses with soaring harmonies.\n\nWorried that the song was too long to be played by D.J.'s, Mr. Spector listed a false running time on the record's label. Instead of its actual length of 3 minutes and 50 seconds, the last two digits were reversed, so the label read 3:05.\n\nThe Righteous Brothers recorded several more hits with Mr. Spector, including ''Unchained Melody,'' ''Ebb Tide'' and ''Just Once in My Life,'' before signing a million-dollar contract with Verve Records. At Verve the group recorded another Mann-Weil song, ''(You're My) Soul and Inspiration,'' with Mr. Medley as producer fastidiously recreating Mr. Spector's wall of sound. It became a No. 1 hit in 1966. In the mid-60's the group was also a regular act on the weekly television show ''Shindig!''\n\nThe group broke up in 1968 and for a short time Mr. Hatfield retained the name the Righteous Brothers on tour, with Jimmy Walker filling in for Mr. Medley.\n\nMr. Hatfield and Mr. Medley reunited in 1974 and had a No. 3 hit with ''Rock and Roll Heaven,'' a tribute to dead rock stars. Mr. Medley retired in 1976, but the two reunited again in 1983. The group was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in Cleveland in 2003.\n\nSomeone once asked me how long I’ve wanted to be a singer. The answer to that question is easy - I’ve always wanted to be a singer. My grandma says that when I was three-years-old I used to sing bible songs I learned in church and my face would light up. When I was three and a half-years-old I had my first dance recital for tap and ballet class. Even back then, I loved performing on stage. During my childhood, my parents enrolled me in a Christian school located in Yorba Linda, California where I performed in the school’s church choirs and took Jazz, Ballet, Tap, and Gymnastics classes. I started writing lyrics and melodies at age nine.\n\nBy the time I was in junior high, I still wanted to sing but I also discovered I had a passion for acting, especially Musical Theatre. I auditioned for the Fullerton College Summer Theatre program for two summers called, Standing Room Only (SRO). In SRO, I performed and took college classes on singing, dancing and music theory. Additionally, I also performed in a few musicals with the Yorba Linda Community Theatre. In school, I was actively involved in the junior high Show Choir and Concert Choir and performed all over the county including the Richard Nixon Library, Disneyland, and Knott’s Berry Farm.\n\nAs I grew older, my desire to become a professional singer and share my God given talent with the world increased. It was clear to everyone around me that my first love was the arts. I knew I always wanted to inspire people and music gave me an outlet to express my feelings, overcome adversity, and make a difference in people’s lives.\n\nIn high school, my passion for the arts continued. I joined every choir the school offered - Concert Choir, Women’s Ensemble, Vocal Jazz, and Show Choir. I also joined the drama club and performed two One Act pieces. Starting sophomore year, I competed throughout the region in the award winning Company C show choir. At age 15, I was selected for the Young Americans (YA) and performed small variety shows throughout Southern California. At age 16, I was selected for Celebration Dinner Theatre in which I was a Singing & Dancing waitress at Cal Poly Pomona College.\n\nAt age 17, after high school graduation, I moved out on my own. I attended Fullerton College and participated in Bravo-Song and Dance Troupe, and was one of the worship Team Leaders at Canyon Hills Friends Church. My second semester of college, I moved to Northern California and performed in the local Musical Theatre program at College of Marin. I graduated with my Associate of Arts degree in Liberal Arts and Music. After completing my first degree, I wanted to find out what the Christian Bible belt music scene was like so I packed my bags and headed to Memphis, Tennessee where I attended Christian Brothers University (CBU) for my last two years of college. I was awarded scholarships for Music and Academics and I graduated with a degree in Information Technology Management and Music Performance.\n\nDuring my time at CBU, I competed in talent shows and performed all over Shelby County with the college choirs. As part of my degree requirements, I prepared and performed solo, a 15 set Senior recital that included pieces in Broadway, Jazz, and Gospel and classical pieces in Italian, German, and Latin.\n\nUpon graduation, I moved to Missouri to work for the Boeing Company, as I needed an income to support myself while pursuing my musical aspirations. Later, I returned to California. I have continued to sharpen my songwriting skills and seek out collaboration opportunities and have taken classes in Piano, Guitar, Ballet, Jazz and Hip-Hop. I perform whenever an opportunity strikes, whether it is for the CEO’s Christmas party at my work, weddings, or funerals.\n\nIn recent years, I competed at Lou Pearlman’s, Fashion Rock in Orlando, Florida and spent seven months at the L.A. Talent Academy ( LATA). I completed LATA workshops on singing, dancing, and performance techniques with industry professionals and performed in two showcases. I also competed in the Contemporary Christian vocal and songwriting categories at the Gospel Music Association (GMA) Music in the Rockies in Estes Park, Colorado. Most recently, I collaborated with an independent producer and wrote and recorded ten original Pop crossover Contemporary Christian songs.\n\nI have been praying for an opportunity to become a professional recording artist. If I get the chance to go on tour I would like to perform an entertaining, heart-felt, and inspiring show. I want to use my original songs to share my life-learned lessons with audiences and be a positive role model for young people. Through my own personal and spiritual life struggles, I have learned not to compromise personal values, to stay true to myself, and the importance of persevering to reach my goals and dreams. I would like to share this valuable message with my fans through my music.\n\nDavid Royer started Mojave Audio in 1985 in the garage of his house. The location was Fullerton, California, and Mojave Audio was a one-man, custom pro audio gear shop. David is best known for his ribbon microphone designs with Royer Labs, but he originally started out designing and building vacuum tube microphones, mic preamps and compressors for engineers in the Los Angeles area.\n\nSince the mid 1990's, David's custom Mojave products have been used on a number of well-known recordings and have achieved legendary status among a small circle of high-end engineers. Mojave Audio Inc. was launched in 2005 to bring David's condenser mic designs to the world.\n\nDavid Royer is one of an elite group of microphone designers who know that music and sound are inseparable from electronic design. Everything David designs comes from his deep, lifelong love of music.\n\nDavid's focus on sound started in his home, where he grew up absorbing the classical and folk music that his parents played constantly. From an early age, he was transfixed by the orchestral recordings he heard, leading to a love of classical music that continues today. At 21, David decided to create his own recordings and purchased an Ampex 960 tape recorder and a couple of off-the-shelf consumer microphones. Unhappy with his early results, he started experimenting with his microphones and soon began an in-depth, lifelong study of microphone design and electronic theory.\n\nAfter a four year hitch in the Navy, where he honed his skills in electronics and acoustics as a sonar technician, David started designing his own microphones. He founded a small company called Mojave Audio in his garage in Fullerton CA, where he modified amplifiers and made his own condenser microphones, mic preamps and compressors. Building gear under the Mojave and DVA labels, he created a number of condenser mics that have become studio staples among a small group of high-end audio engineers. In 1997 David designed his first ribbon microphone, The R-121, which led to the opening of Royer Labs in 1998. In a short period of time it became a breakthrough ribbon microphone that reintroduced ribbons to engineers around the world. David also designed a number of ribbon \"firsts,\" including phantom powered ribbons and tube ribbon mics.\n\nTyler Walton is a professional drummer with many years of experience both performing live and recording in the studio.
