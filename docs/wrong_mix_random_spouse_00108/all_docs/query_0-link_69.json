        "text": "Filipinos have been through a lot this 2009—there's the global recession, natural disasters topped by typhoons Ondoy and Pepeng that caused great floods in the country, and most recently the Maguindanao massacre that ended the lives of several media practitioners and civilians.\n\nThis year was also marked by the unexpected deaths of prominent personalities. So, before we say goodbye to all the negativity of 2009 and welcome the New Year, PEP recalls the people whose passing many Filipinos mourned for.\n\nFrancis Magalona. Many got curious when all the hosts of Eat... Bulaga! appeared on stage looking sad after a commercial break. It took a while before Vic Sotto, who was at the center leading the group, got the courage to deliver the bad news to avid fans and viewers of the noontime show—the passing of their \"dabarkads\" Francis Magalona.\n\nThe Pinoy Master Rapper fought a \"happy battle\" with leukemia for nearly seven months before his body finally gave up on March 6. Francis was very open about his illness which he updated on his blog as often as he could, including photos of his chemotherapies, facts about leukemia, and, of course, fun moments with his wife Pia and their eight children.\n\nFrancis is considered a great loss to the music industry. He was able to share his love of country through his songs such as \"Mga Kababayan,\" \"Tayo'y Mga Pinoy,\" and \"Man From Manila.\"\n\nFollowing his death were special tributes from different music artists including the second set of Eraserhead's reunion concert last March. Francis was supposed to guest on the concert for the song number \"Super Proxy,\" which he had performed in a duet with former frontman Ely Buendia in the band's 2005 album.

He was found lifeless in his room at his Lucban, Quezon home. Later reports said that he died of a heart attack. (CLICK HERE to read related article.)\n\nThe 64-year-old talent manager was responsible for the showbiz careers of some of the big names in Philippine entertainment, like Richard Gomez and wife Lucy Torres-Gomez, Joey Marquez, John Estrada, brothers Anjo Yllana and Jomari Yllana, and sisters Janice de Belen and Gelli de Belen, to name a few.\n\nHe also had a hand in discovering other popular stars like Claudine Barretto, Carmina Villaroel, Nadia Montenegro and Eric Fructuoso.\n\nDouglas, or Tito Dougs to his close friends and talents, also contributed his talent to the movie industry by writing the screenplays of Isang Gabi, Tatlong Babae (1975) and Zoom, Zoom, Superman! (1973). He also put up his own movie production outfit named MAQ Productions. He was also credited as executive producer, line producer, and project coordinator for many movies of Regal Films, owned by Mother Lily Monteverde, and other film outfits.\n\nMichael Jackson. Less than two weeks after the passing of Douglas, the entertainment industry was slammed again with another shocking news—the death of King of Pop Michael Jackson.\n\nJackson was slated to have his most-awaited comeback concert in July. But he died of cardiac arrest on June 25 at the UCLA Medical Center in Los Angeles, California.\n\nIt took more than two months before his remains were finally laid to rest. His family had to wait until an autopsy was done. This was after reports came out saying that his personal physician, Dr. Conrad Murray, allegedly administered a powerful anesthetic to the King of Pop shortly before he died.\n\nAlthough Jackson had passed away, fans still had the chance to watch their idol for the last time in This Is It last October. This docu-film, which was shown for only two weeks around the world, showed footages of the rehearsals for the supposed final concert of the international pop singer.

Former President Corazon Aquino, who fought colon cancer for several months, died of cardio-respiratory arrest at the Makati Medical Center. She was surrounded by her five children—Ballsy Aquino-Cruz, Pinky Aquino-Abellada, Noynoy Aquino, Viel Aquino-Dee, and Kris Aquino-Yap—and other close relatives and friends when she passed away. (CLICK HERE to read related article.)\n\nHundreds of thousands of Pinoys patiently lined up at La Salle Greenhills in San Juan City and the Manila Cathedral in Intramuros, Manila, to pay their last respects to the country's former leader. On its way to the Manila Cathedral, Pres. Cory's funeral cortege passed by Ayala Avenue, Makati City, and stopped beside her husband Ninoy Aquino's statue.\n\nPres. Cory's wake was also visited by aspiring senator Ferdinand Marcos Jr. and Imee Marcos, children of the late Martial Law president Ferdinand Marcos. Pres. Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo also paid her last respects to Pres. Aquino.\n\nThe funeral procession took more than eight hours to reach the Manila Memorial Park in Parañaque City because of the many Filipinos who waited on the streets where her cortege would pass by to pay their last respects to the enduring symbol of People Power.\n\nBernard Bonnin. Veteran actor Bernard Bonnin died on November 21, one week after his confinement at the hospital due to stroke. (CLICK HERE to read related article.)\n\nThe 70-year-old actor had been dubbed as the \"Palos ng Pinilakang Tabing.\" He used to play \"pretty boy\" roles before he got his break to play the lead character in LVN's movie adaptation of the komiks novel Alyas Palos, which he would reprise eight times.\n\nThe veteran actor also played superheroes in such films as Gagamba (1962) and Captain Karate (1965).

However, he requested to go home a couple of days later, where he spent his last days with his wife, filmmaker and actress Laurice Guillen, and their daughters, opera singer and theater actress Ana Feleo and TV and film actress Ina Feleo.\n\nDelgado was a multi-awarded actor who was often featured in films directed by critically acclaimed directors such as Lino Brocka, Mike de Leon and Ishmael Bernal. His movies included Kakabakaba Ka Ba?

Not many were aware of it, but earlier this year, the industry lost a good character actor and radio reporter with the passing of Chris Daluz.\n\nDaluz was in Olongapo City shooting scenes for his Korean film when he suffered a mild stroke.\n\nThe 74-year-old actor once worked as a radio reporter for dzMM.

A tragic incident ended the lives of Filipino-Canadian film critic Alexis Tioseco and his Slovenian girlfriend Nika Bohinc.

He was also a regular contributor to several magazines and top newspapers.\n\nThai Film Journal mentioned in its blog that the slain film critic was also one of the founding programmers of the S-Express program series of Southeast Asian and Asian films that travels to film festivals in the region and around the world.\n\nTrinidad Etong. She was not a household name but she made headlines in death because initial suspicions fell on her husband, ABS-CBN broadcaster Ted Failon, for allegedly being involved in her tragic demise on April 16.\n\nThe 45-year-old Etong sustained a gunshot wound to the head in an incident that was investigated by police. While some speculated that Failon's wife was killed by another person, his camp claimed that she committed suicide.\n\nThe bathroon at Failon's house, which was reportedly the scene of the incident, was cleaned up by his house helpers. The same thing was done to the vehicle that was used to bring Etong to the hospital. The gun used in the shooting incident reportedly passed hands.\n\nThe National Bureau of Investigation (NBI) findings later showed that Etong committed suicide.\n\nEraño Manalo. Hundreds of thousands of Pinoy followers of the Iglesia Ni Cristo mourned as one when Ka Eraño \"Erdy\" Manalo passed away due to cardiopulmonary arrest on August 31.\n\nFor a long time as the executive minister, Ka Erdy had guided his religious group in maintaining the tightness of their church.
