However, the cause of his death is unknown until results of the autopsy are known.\n\nHis personal physician, who was with him at the time, attempted to resuscitate Jackson, as did paramedics who transported him to Ronald Reagan UCLA Medical Center. Upon arriving at the hospital at approximately 1:14 p.m., a team of doctors, including emergency physicians and cardiologists, attempted to resuscitate him for a period of more than one hour but were unsuccessful.\n\nJackson's family requests that the media respect their privacy during this tragic period of time.\n\n-UCLA-"
