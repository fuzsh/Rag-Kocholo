        "text": "Redondo Beach, city, Los Angeles county, southern California, U.S. It is adjacent to Palos Verde Peninsula (south) and Hermosa Beach (north), on Santa Monica Bay. Originally inhabited by Gabrielino (Tongva) Indians, the area became part of Rancho San Pedro, a Spanish land grant made to Juan Domínguez in 1784. A former commercial port for Los Angeles (before development of San Pedro Harbor), it was initially a trade centre for oil and lumber and later grew as a beach resort after the Redondo Hotel was built (1890). It is now a bedroom community of greater Los Angeles. King Harbor, protected by a breakwater, has modern marina facilities, and the Redondo Beach Pier, with its many shops, restaurants, and performance spaces, attracts many visitors. Surfing is popular at the city’s beaches. Inc. 1892. Pop. (2000) 63,261; (2010) 66,748."
