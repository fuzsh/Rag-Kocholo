        "text": "You may think you know the real story behind the death of Michael Jackson. Harvey Levin would beg to differ. The head honcho of TMZ talked to Deco about the upcoming Fox special that blows the cover off of MJ’s death.\n\nGet ready for one wild ride.\n\nWe might have thought Michael Jackson would always be there, amazing us with his tremendous live performances.\n\nWhen Michael Jackson’s personal physician, Dr. Conrad Murray, was convicted in the death of the singer, the case was closed or so we thought.\n\nHarvey Levin’s new special, “TMZ Investigates: Who really killed Michael Jackson”, shines a light on the people allegedly responsible for his demise.\n\nHarvey Levin: “There were a lot of people who have never had a reckoning over his death, and that’s what we get into. That’s what we focus on.”\n\nAccording to Harvey, the special’s been long overdue.\n\nHarvey Levin: “We broke the story of Michael Jackson’s death and followed it for a long time, and there were things about this for us that never sat right.”\n\nMaybe the biggest thing was believing only one doctor was responsible for Michael’s drug use.\n\nHarvey Levin: “To say Conrad Murray is the beginning and end of his story simply isn’t true, and that’s not just us saying it. that’s the detective who arrested … Conrad Murray. We knew that there were multiple doctors doing, what doctor Murray had done and that they had done it over the course of years.”\n\nThe special makes sure to point out the singer wasn’t an innocent party in all this.\n\nHarvey Levin: “Michael was gonna get what he wanted, and if you said no he would find somebody who would do it for him.”\n\nWe get to hear from those closest to Michael, like ex-wife Debbie Rowe, who worked for one of his doctors.\n\nDebbie Rowe: “People died. In some way, I was a part of it. Give me a minute.”\n\nConrad Murray gets to tell his side of the story.\n\nConrad Murray: “Michael Jackson was a drug addict, and he was a master at manipulation because I was manipulated by Michael.”\n\n“TMZ Investigates: Who really killed Michael Jackson” premieres Tuesday at 8 p.m. on Channel 7.\n\nCopyright 2024 Sunbeam Television Corp.
