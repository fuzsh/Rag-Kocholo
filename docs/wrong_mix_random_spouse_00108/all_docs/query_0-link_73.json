At 103, Phinney still lived independently, drove, and maintained an active correspondence to promote the legacy of U.S. President Andrew Johnson in his hometown of Greeneville, Tenn.\n\nPhinney attended Tech when enrollment was 527 students and dormitories were without the luxury of running water. He was featured in the spring 1998 issue of the Virginia Tech Magazine.\n\nBack to Contents"
