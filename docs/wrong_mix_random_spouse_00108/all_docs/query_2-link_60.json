        "text": "Michael Jackson’s death at the age of 50 in June 2009 shocked thousands of fans worldwide but others are asking whether it was all an elaborate show.\n\nJackson conspiracy theorists, known as “believers”, have long claimed that the singer is still alive, having faked his own death.\n\nIn early 2017, investment banker David Dunn took the stand in the US Tax Court in Los Angeles and said Jackson was “on the edge” of going bankrupt before his death - fuelling theories that the pop legend may simply have changed his identity in order to escape his financial problems.\n\nIn July last year, Hollywood hairdresser Steve Erhardt, who was a close friend of Jackson, claimed he had information about the star that “not even the family knows”.\n\nIn a post on Facebook, Erhardt wrote: “A tip for the believers, the Michael Jackson believers. You heard it here first, an announcement of sorts.\n\n“And in a couple of months, or latest at the end of the year, you will be receiving some very good news. It’s almost unbelievable. And not even the family knows… but I do.”\n\nNo more news was forthcoming from Erhardt, but believers insist Jackson must simply have decided to remain in hiding.\n\nHere are four more conspiracy theories about the King of Pop’s death.\n\nJackson's daughter thinks he was murdered\n\nIn 2017, Paris Jackson told Rolling Stone magazine that she was convinced her father had been murdered.\n\n“All arrows point to that. It sounds like a total conspiracy theory and it sounds like bullshit, but all real fans and everybody in the family knows it. It was a set-up. It was bullshit,” she said.\n\nSome online conspiracy theorists questioned whether she was pointing to a group such as the Illuminati.\n\nJackson’s will wasn’t signed by him\n\nIn 2012, five of the singer’s brothers and sisters - Janet, Rebbie, Randy, Tito and Jermaine - signed a letter to the executors of Jackson’s estate, John Branca and John McClain, accusing the pair of fraud, forgery, exploitation and abuse. The letter was published on gossip site Celebuzz.\n\nJackson’s siblings claimed that he was not in Los Angeles on the day his will was dated, 7 July 2002, and therefore could not have signed it. They also claimed that Jackson said he despised Branca and McClain and didn’t want them to have anything to do with his life.\n\nRepresentatives for his estate responded: “We are saddened that false and defamatory accusations grounded in stale internet conspiracy theories are now being made by certain members of Michael’s family whom he chose to leave out of his will.”\n\nJackson was killed for his music catalogue\n\nLa Toya Jackson has repeatedly said there was a conspiracy to kill her brother and that he knew he was going to die. He reportedly told her: “La Toya, I’m going to be murdered for my music publishing catalogue and my estate.”\n\nLast year The Sun reported the existence of a note allegedly written by Jackson just weeks before his death that appears to support this theory. The note read: “They are trying to murder me.” Jackson continued that he was '“scared about his life” and that “the system wants to kill me for my catalogue”, according to the newspaper.\n\nJackson killed himself with drugs\n\nOn 28 August 2009, the LA County Coroner made an official statement classifying Jackson’s death as homicide. The coroner stated that he died from the combination of drugs in his body, including anesthetic propofol that Jackson’s personal doctor Conrad Murray had been giving him to treat sleep problems for two months prior to his death. Murray was eventually found guilty of involuntary manslaughter in 2011 and was sentenced to two years in jail.\n\nBefore his trial, Murray’s lawyer claimed that the singer “took desperate measures” because of his deteriorating finances. However, the judge refused Murray’s request for Jackson’s financial records.\n\nLawyer Howard Weitzman, representing the singer’s estate, asked: \"Is the theory that Michael Jackson committed suicide, took his own life? I don't think that’s a salable theory.\""
