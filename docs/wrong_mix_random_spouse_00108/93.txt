Known as the “King of Pop,” Michael Jackson's untimely death at 50 shocked the world. The circumstances surrounding his death are still shrouded in mystery, and although an autopsy was conducted, the official cause of death has been released to the public.

In this article, we'll look at what is known about how Michael Jackson died and explore some of the theories surrounding his death.

How Did Michael Jackson Die?

Michael Jackson died on June 25, 2009, at 50. The official cause of death was announced as “acute propofol intoxication,” and Jackson's physician, Conrad Murray, was charged with involuntary manslaughter.

The night before his death, Jackson was reportedly struggling to sleep and had been taking the sedative propofol to help him rest. Sometime around noon on the day of his death, Murray gave Jackson another dose of propofol and left the room.

When Jackson failed to emerge from his bedroom at the appointed time, concerns were raised, and Murray went back to check on him. He found Jackson unresponsive and not breathing and immediately called for help.

CPR and emergency services were performed on Jackson, but it was unsuccessful, and he was pronounced dead at 2:26 pm.

What Caused Michael Jackson's Death?

The official cause of death was announced as “acute propofol intoxication,” but there is still some debate surrounding what exactly led to Jackson's death.

The main theory is that Jackson died from a combination of the sedatives lorazepam and propofol. Propofol is a powerful anesthetic typically used in surgery and is not meant for home use. Michael Jackson reportedly used propofol to help him sleep. The lorazepam caused Jackson to stop breathing, and the propofol exacerbated the problem.

The Day Before

Rehearsals for Michael Jackson's “This Is It” tour were underway at the Staples Center in Los Angeles on June 24, 2009. The 50-year-old pop star was scheduled to perform shows in concert. It is said that insomnia, eating disorders, and painkiller abuse had caught up with Jackson in the months leading to his death. After the rehearsals, Jackson's physician, Conrad Murray, gave him a powerful anesthetic to help him sleep.

Morning And Afternoon of June 25th

The physician again administered propofol to Michael Joseph Jackson in the morning due to his insomnia. This time, Murray left Jackson's bedside to make phone calls and paperwork, returning to find the singer not breathing. He tried unsuccessfully to revive Jackson and then called for help.

CPR was performed on Jackson for 42 minutes before he was rushed to the hospital.

Questions have arisen about the time it took for Murray to get help and his CPR technique. There was no landline phone in residence, and Murray said that he didn't know the address well enough to call paramedics by mobile phone.

As a result, 30 minutes passed before security at the North Carolwood Drive property eventually called paramedics.

It is also unclear whether Murray gave Jackson chest compressions or not. The ambulance took Jackson to UCLA Medical Center, where he was pronounced dead at 2:26 p.m.

The Autopsy And Toxicology Report

An autopsy was performed on Michael Jackson the day after he died. The Los Angeles County Coroner office released a statement saying that the cause of death was “acute propofol intoxication.” The coroner's report listed other drugs in Jackson's system, including midazolam, diazepam, lidocaine, and ephedrine.

Murray told police that he had administered propofol to Jackson numerous times in the weeks following his death to help him sleep.

The coroner's report said that Jackson had needle marks on his left leg and ankles and bruising on his upper arms and back.

The Anatomy of an Overdose

An overdose of propofol can cause respiratory arrest and death. The drug is meant to be used in a hospital setting with constant monitoring by trained medical personnel. Also, propofol should never be given to someone not already sedated, as it can cause them to stop breathing.

Murray has said that he was not trained in the use of propofol and that he did not have the proper equipment to administer the drug safely.

The Inquest and Trial

Murray was charged with involuntary manslaughter in 2011 and went to trial in 2013. The case ended in a hung jury, but Murray was found guilty of involuntary manslaughter in a later trial. He was sentenced to four years in prison but released after serving two years. Also, the state revoked his medical license.
