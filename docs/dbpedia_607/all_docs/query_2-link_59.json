        "text": "Museum pedagogy with all its theoretical and practical aspects is a discipline, which in the Czech Republic currently experiences a period of boom. The past twenty years of unrestricted development, when museums ceased to serve as a tool of official propaganda and returned to free interpretation of their collections, saw not only an increase in interest of the society in museums but also a struggle of museums for new audience. From a practical view we thus find a wide offer of activities and fringe programmes of various quality, and on a theoretical level we can follow up the interest of museologists and pedagogues in the hinterland of the discipline. Museum pedagogy in the Czech Republic rests on a solid base of a long-time tradition. The paper gives a brief overview of the development of this discipline in the Czech Republic both on a theoretical level and from the view of education at the Masaryk University in Brno. Muzejní pedagogika ve své teoretické i prakticistní rovině je oborem, který v České republice zažívá úspěšné období. Za posledních dvacet let vývoje společnosti, kdy muzea přestala být nástrojem režimních sdělení, ale vrátila se ke svobodné interpretaci sbírek, stoupl nejen zájem společnosti o muzea, ale především zájem muzeí o návštěvníky. V prakticistní rovině tak v různorodé kvalitě nacházíme pestrou nabídku aktivit a doprovodných programů, v teoretické rovině můžeme sledovat zájem muzeologů i pedagogů o zázemí oboru. Zázemí muzejní pedagogiky v České republice stojí ovšem na pevných základech dlouholeté tradice. Příspěvek je krátkým připomenutím vývoje oboru v České republice jak v rovině teoretické, tak i v rovině jeho výuky na Masarykově univerzitě v Brně.\n\nIn this paper I will explore a concept of museum as the service organization. Conducting service activity is often badly associated, seen as something mediocre (in Polish perspective). However, service perspective won't rob the museum from traditionally meanings, but it will enrich them giving new explanation fields and broaden the museum meaning. Museum offer is enough unique, that only it, as the service provider is able to enrich the viewer in a unique aesthetic and spiritual values. The way to perform an ancillary role towards the society is undoubtedly providing by museums the public services. The role of public service provider is harmonized with the educational function. There is a need to change the paradigm, in order to notice not only human, but also service dimension of these cultural institutions function.\n\nIn recent years, the museums are places also undertakes educational tasks as well as incorporates and aiming to be preserved and exhibit many objects. However, museum education, which enables individuals to approach their own cultures and many different cultures with a very perspective of tolerance and respect, is based on the recognition of similarities and differences, the development of awareness of intercultural understanding and the development of empathy, raising the quality of education and protecting the environment and cultural assets. On the other hand, the development of multicultural education policies in today's postmodern teaching approaches can be associated with museum education. It is an all-purpose concept that includes multiculturalism, race, ethnicity, language, sexual orientation, gender, age, disability, social class, religious preference and other cultural dimensions that develop within the modern globalization process. The purpose of this study is to determine the relevance of museum education to multicultural education and as a result, how it will contribute to the multicultural education understanding of museum education. Generating the study subject by considering educational dimensions of the museums, it was effective to think that cultural values hosted by these institutions may be closely related to the \"multicultural education\" model which is especially developed with the globalizing world in recent years. It is possible to say that in the study in which the content analysis method is used, there are no studies in which these two concepts coexist. As regards multicultural education, it is seen that the perceptions, attitudes, competencies or opinions of students, prospective teachers, teachers, school principals and academicians are often consulted. In relation to museum education, museum education activities and studies related to expert, teacher candidates and student opinions are included. JEL Classification: I20.\n\nThe study aims to present the best practices of museum education, art pedagogy and circus pedagogy in Hungary, to highlight their importance and their role as mediators of cultural values and their role in social equal opportunities. It emphasizes the role of non-formal forms of learning that are capable of meeting learners’ needs in a well-defined, differentiated, and experiential way outside the school system. At the same time, the study reflects on current issues in the renewal of museum education. Among other things, for those who want to study, «everything is more interesting outside of school». Changing learning habits and technical opportunities poses a major challenge in sustaining learning motivation. It also emphasizes the potential of informal learning in diverse settings - family, community, informal and supportive of information acquisition and capacity building (Coombs 1969, 1972). It cites examples of good domestic practice as interpreted by the Constructivist Museum ...\n\nMuseums are the most effective settings for life-wide learning used in arts education. The aim of this study is to determine the effect of use of museums for educational purposes on a Studio Art-painting-course. In this study designed according to case studies technique, one of the qualitative research methods, a semi-structured interview form was used to determine students' opinions on the learning process. The study group of the research was composed of sophomore students from the Division of Painting Education of the Department of Fine Arts Education at Bartın University. A museum trip took place in this four-week study, after which students were requested to draw some oil painting. Following the hands-on work, students were interviewed, and their drawings were collected. Data obtained from student interviews were put into a descriptive analysis, and they were arranged according to the specific theme of each. Oil paintings created by students as part of the study were interpreted descriptively by consulting experts, too. The results showed that students were really enjoyed attending a course in a museum, drawing right there. Students stated that they were attracted and got excited by different activities and learning environments in general and by attending a course in the museum, in particular. Considering data obtained from the interviews, the positive contribution reported by students was also reflected on their oil paint drawings, which were the practical component of the study.\n\nModern approach evolved modern museums as dialogue centres which make close contact with visitors based on learning in order to present its exhibition objects. Along with twenty first century, being one of the most important places among the social functions of museums, \" education \" has almost been one of the traditional functions of them. Besides the educational facilities which museums provide visitors, they should also develop their physical structures in a contemporary line, and reconsider them in a way that highlights individual experience and visitor interaction during the time spent in there. In order to maximize interaction between visitors and museums, museum education which is developed by using pedagogical methods and grounding on various values, concepts and information has a close relation with visual culture that is an interdisciplinary concept. Visual culture has put popular objects into museums and been an important subject on which modern museums focused in order to provide their sustainability. Modern museums produce information and aim to spread information to all classes in a society by using educational activities; also when they are considered as living places, they are used to practice the functions of visual culture. These practices have been helpful for developing information technologies in museums especially for the last thirty years and, resulted in implementing a structural reform and revisions in regard to integrating these technologies with museum perception. In the frame of these revisions, online technologies, simulations, interactive presentations and digital exhibitions are at the first place. These chances that took place in museums have been the source for from the collections of these institutions to their policies and also from the use of human resources to digitalizing of their activities. The purpose of this study is to identify the visual culture activities which take place in modern museums in the framework of educational activities, and to display practice samples in Turkish museums in detail. The study is a result of a descriptive survey model research that contains samples regarding 81 visual culture practices in the world and Turkish museums. The study is limited with state and private museums which are tied to Turkish Republic Ministry of Culture and Tourism and inspected by the relevant ministry. Visual culture practices that took place in these museums are gathered by using structured interview forms and commented by analyzing content analysis."
