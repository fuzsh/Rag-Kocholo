        "text": "Every time we meet, we resolve to build a stronger organisation. We started in India in 2007 and have had our share of ups and downs in the journey of 16 years till date. Today we stand in India as the only organic global asset management in the country. In this entire period, what has stood as a constant for us, is our team. Even after spending almost 13 years in the organistion, I feel new compared to many of my colleagues. We met recently at Goa to discuss our way forward and also to know each other better. A team that meets together, strategizes together, has fun together, works harder together! The key word always remains \"together\". As employees, three things are required of us: 1.We work with no insecurity. I personally feel that insecurity is the biggest hindrance to personal growth 2.We submit ourselves totally to the organisation and let the organisation decide our future( I know this is easier said than done). But I have seen many who have grown exponentially by doing that. 3.We will always remember that the organisation is bigger than us. To do this we have to keep these two things in mind: 1. Always remain relevant. Today, employees( including CEOs) are assessed not on their past contribution to the organistion or vintage within the company, but on whether they remain relevant to the organization's future. Am I able to feature myself strongly in the future plans and growth of the organisation will determine my value. That has to be way employees build their approach in their career now. For the past work, one has already been compensated. That is the simple truth. So, one has to work hard on learning and sometimes take a very painful path of unlearning in order to remain relevant. Not many will succeed as many remain caught up with their past achievements. 2. Always be future ready. For doing this, one has to develop the ability of what we call at Mirae \"destroy yesterday\". As Indians, we are very emotional and get into the trap of remaining in the past. To understand future trends, one has to get past that. Only then can one gain the ability to gauge what is coming. One has to become very cognizant of data and future trends. At Mirae, we believe we are very data centric in most of our decision making. There is this wonderful thought. If the external environment moves faster than you, you stand disrupted. To remain relevant, you have to always keep pace with the changing world. If you are able to move faster than the external environment, then you are the disruptor. We came back with these thoughts in our minds and with the singular resolve to continue to uphold the fiduciary nature of the job that we are so fortunate to have. #miraeasset #assetmanagement"
