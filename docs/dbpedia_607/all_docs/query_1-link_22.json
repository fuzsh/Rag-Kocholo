PHOTO: FILE\n\nThe situation is so dire that Meatcoâs subsidiary in the United Kingdom (UK) is under liquidation.\n\nA BoN analysis shows that during this period, Meatco could have\n\nreceived approximately N$6.1 billion instead of N$2.1 billion for the\n\nmeat products it exported.\n\nâThis can easily absorb the losses\n\nincurred by Meatco over the last\n\n[five] years between 2018 and\n\n2023, amounting to N$636 million.â\n\nThe analysis by the central bank\n\nwas conducted on request of public\n\nenterprises minister Ipumbu Shiimi\n\nto investigate the underselling of\n\nMeatco products and potential revenue opportunities for the company.\n\nUnder-declared\n\nIn those five years, Meatco has exported 53.3 million kilograms of\n\nmeat, making revenues of N$2.1\n\nbillion.\n\nâThis revenue is significantly\n\nunder-declared by N$4 billion, in\n\ncomparison to Meatcoâs Namibian\n\ncompetitors who export meat to the\n\nsame market using a conservative\n\nmarket rate.â\n\nThe bank said during the period\n\nunder review, Meatco took up 73%\n\nof the market share of meat exports, yet received less than 50% of\n\nreturns compared to revenues made\n\nby its main local competitors.\n\nFor instance, on average, Meatco\n\npriced meat per kilogram to Norway at N$48.12, while new local\n\nmarket player Beefcor Meatâs supplies are priced at N$154.34 per kilogram. Farmers Meat Market sold\n\nits meat at N$211.22 per kilogram.\n\nMeatcoâs price per kilogram in New\n\nZealand was N$45.52, while Beefcorâs price was N$109.11.\n\nIn South Africa, Meatcoâs beef\n\nis sold at N$31.93 per kilogram,\n\nFarmers Meat Market charges\n\nN$68.67 and Hartlief priced its\n\nproduct at N$76.08.\n\nWith regards to the United Kingdom, Meatco priced beef exports at\n\nN$44.69 per kilogram and Beefcor\n\npriced its products at N$71.43.\n\nSignificantly lower\n\nâWe further noted that Meatco has\n\na marketing agency, GPS Food\n\nGroup, which is also an importer\n\nof meat from both Meatco and\n\nits competitors in Namibia.â\n\nThe bank said the agency specifically markets Beefcor, whose\n\nexports to GPS amounted to 1.2\n\nmillion kilograms, with a value\n\nof N$173 million sold to Norway.\n\nIn this respect, the data showed\n\nthat the price at which Meatcoâs\n\nbeef is exported by the marketing agency is significantly lower\n\nthan the price charged by its\n\ncompetitors who use the same\n\nagency, it said.\n\nâDuring the 2022 financial year,\n\nthe turnover for GPS was estimated at N$4.2 billion annually in the UK, compared to the\n\nturnover of Meatcoâs UK subsidiary at N$10.8 million.â\n\nGPS also imports meat from Brukarros Meat Processors.\n\nDuring the period under review,\n\nGPS imported four million kilograms of beef valued at N$164.8\n\nmillion, while the beef transactions for Brukkaros were 209 000\n\nkilograms, valued at N$3.9 million.\n\nThe bank said Meatcoâs UK subsidiary has over the period imported 10 million kilograms of\n\nmeat, valued at N$492 million.\n\nâThe prices per kilogram are significantly less compared to competitors such as Beefcor.â\n\nSuspicious\n\nAccording to the BoN document,\n\nNamibia Meat Import and Export is a subsidiary of Meatco in\n\nSouth Africa and imported 15 million kilograms of meat valued at\n\nN$487.5 million for the period.\n\nâTheir transactions also reflect\n\nunder-declarations and further\n\nreconciliations by the auditors or\n\nforensic auditors could be warranted.â\n\nIt said it is suspicious that GPS\n\nmakes an annual turnover of\n\nN$4.1 billion while Meatco makes\n\nlosses, adding that the companyâs\n\nUK subsidiary is consequently under liquidation.\n\nIn October 2023, Meatco owed\n\ncommercial farmers N$320 million for cattle delivered to its abattoirs. The capital bill has since\n\nbeen settled, but Meatco has not\n\nbeen able to pay interest on such\n\ndebt â a situation that has infuriated producers.\n\nEfforts to reach Meatco CEO\n\nMwilima Mushokabanji for comment proved futile.\n\nOpuwo theft\n\nMute\n\nThe police, who came under heavy\n\ncriticism for announcing the\n\namount as N$200 million, insisted\n\nthat it was Bank Windhoek who initially reported such an amount.\n\nâPlease understand that the information shared [by the Namibian\n\nPolice] was shared as obtained from\n\nthe complainant [Bank Windhoek]\n\non that particular date, including\n\nthe figures,â police spokesperson,\n\nDeputy Commissioner Kauna Shikwambi, told journalists on Monday.\n\nâWe are, however, glad that after\n\nthe investigation was launched, the\n\nsame complainant rectified the figures in their press release.â\n\nSuspicious\n\nAccording to an industry source, itâs\n\nâsuspiciousâ that the bank changed\n\nits version of the amount stolen.\n\nâItâs a big reputational risk for\n\nthem, more so because they are a\n\nlisted entity whose share price can\n\nbe massively affected.â\n\nA Namibian Sun visit to Opuwo\n\nthis week uncovered Rebebeâs allegedly wild social life, which is suspected to have fuelled his lust for\n\nmoney.\n\nHe and Megameno were allegedly\n\nspotted together in Opuwo over the\n\nfestive season, while Rebebe reportedly also provides his former colleague with accommodation when\n\nhe comes to town for court proceedings emanating from the 2021 theft.\n\nEarly bird\n\nRebebe, an administrative clerk at\n\nthe bank, is alleged to have transferred the money into two bank accounts last Saturday. By virtue of\n\nhis position, which is quite senior\n\nat branch level, he reportedly had\n\nmore admin access to bank systems.\n\nâHe used his access to make it\n\nlook like two people made deposits of N$1 million each. The system\n\nshows these were deposits, but actual records show they were internal\n\ntransfers,â a source said.\n\nOn the day of the alleged theft,\n\nRebebe clocked in at around 07:00,\n\nmaking him the very first person to\n\nreport for duty.\n\nAt around 08:00 when his colleagues arrived, he allegedly went\n\nto a nearby shop and then proceeded to a well-known local restaurant,\n\nwhere he bought beer âto calm his\n\nnervesâ.\n\nHe returned to the bank and after he made the two transactions, he\n\nreportedly went outside and started\n\nmaking calls. It is suspected these\n\ncalls were to other members of a\n\nsyndicate, for them to start withdrawing money at ATMs across the\n\ncountry.\n\nAfter returning inside, Rebebe\n\nallegedly unplugged the telephone\n\nlines, while the CCTV cameras were\n\nalso tampered with.\n\nAt around 11:30, he then informed\n\nhis colleagues that he was stepping\n\nout. He left with a backpack that\n\npurportedly contained N$500 000\n\nin cash.\n\nHours later\n\nThe theft was only detected two\n\nhours after the transaction, officials\n\nclose to the matter said.\n\nâThe way banks work is that you\n\ncan only detect anomalies when\n\npeople start reconciling transactions made that day, and that usually only happens when the bank has\n\nbeen closed to customers,â an industry insider said.\n\nIn this case, the transactions were detected due to being above the allowed threshold.\n\nWhen the suspicious transactions were detected, bank officials in\n\nWindhoek attempted to call Opuwo,\n\nbut they could not get hold of anyone due to the telephone being unplugged.\n\nBy the time they got hold of their\n\nnorthern colleagues, Rebebe had disappeared. It is understood that two\n\nother men are wanted in connection\n\nwith the incident.\n\nWho is Rebebe?\n\nOriginally from Opuwo, Rebebe completed grade 12 at Outjo Secondary\n\nSchool in 2014. He was born in July\n\n1993.\n\nOne of his former teachers said:\n\nâHe was very smart; not academically,\n\nbut street smart. He wasnât a troublesome learnerâ.\n\nAnother educator remarked: âHe\n\nwas a learner who smiled a lot when\n\nhe was found doing something wrong.\n\nHe smiled to neutralise the situationâ.\n\nâ Additional reporting by Toivo\n\nNdjebela.\n\n[email protected]\n\nContinued from page 1\n\nContinued from page 1\n\nContinued from page 1\n\n/Ui told Namibian Sun that he has\n\nbeen bathing her and cooking for\n\ntheir family since the start of this sad\n\nordeal, all while he tries to lure a few\n\nwords from her.\n\nHe doesnât mind these tasks, he\n\nadded.\n\nâIt is her silence that haunts me,\n\nnothing else. She just looks at me,\n\nand then her eyes fall to the ground,\n\nand thatâs how she sits all day. I have\n\nto sometimes shake her to breastfeed\n\nthe crying baby. Iâm not sure if she\n\nhears the baby cry,â he said.\n\nAsked whether the timeless rituals\n\nof the San people might be able to\n\nheal her, he stared up to the sky and\n\nspoke in Ju /hoan, as if asking the\n\ngods for answers.\n\nStressful event\n\nLocal psychologist Dr Shaun\n\nWhittaker said women going mute\n\nafter childbirth can happen when\n\nthe birth is particularly stressful,\n\nadding that high levels of anxiety\n\ncan lead to a host of issues.\n\nHe explained that women can\n\nlose their voice for a day or two,\n\nor longer. They can go blind, or\n\nlose the ability to use one of their\n\nhands for a few days.\n\nâIn the olden days, they called it\n\nhysterical speech loss. Nowadays,\n\nitâs called functional neurological\n\nsystem disorder. It simply means\n\nthat one of the neurological functions in the body does not function well because of a stressful\n\nevent.â\n\nHe added that itâs usually temporary, and said he hopes //Asaâs\n\nspeech will soon return.\n\n[email protected]\n\nP:03\n\nWINE\n\nDOWN\n\nWEDNESDAY\n\nVALID 17-20 JANUARY 2024\n\nE&OE\n\nOSHITUFI\n\nDRY RED WINE\n\n750ml\n\nN$2999\n\nEACH\n\nTASSENBERG\n\nDRY RED WINE\n\n2L\n\nN$8499\n\nEACH\n\nOFFERS VALID FROM 17 - 20 JANUARY 2024 ONLY.

Many were\n\npleasantly surprised, while others\n\nsaid his speech oozed hypocrisy\n\nas his administration had previously agreed with Germany that\n\nit did not commit a genocide in\n\nNamibia.\n\nWhen the German government\n\nrejected the genocide charges\n\nagainst Israel on Friday, 12 January, it marked exactly 120 years\n\nsince Imperial Germany attacked\n\nNamibiaâs Nama and Ovaherero\n\npeople in 1904.\n\nDuring an interview with Al Jazeera, Professor Katjiua Mutjinde\n\n- Paramount Chief of the Ovaherero Traditional Authority -\n\ndescribed Geingobâs speech as\n\ncommendable, but added that it\n\nwas hypocritical as the issue of\n\nreparations has yet to be concluded, while the Nama and Ovaherero\n\npeople remain shut out of direct\n\nnegotiations with Germany.\n\nAccording to him, it only makes\n\nsense for Namibia to stand behind\n\nPalestine as the country has a long\n\nhistory of collaboration with that\n\nstate since the time of its late leader, Yasser Arafat.\n\nâNamibiaâs intervention is applaudable, but it comes as a surprise to us, the Nama and Ovaherero, that our president is now\n\naccusing Germany of not being\n\nin line with the [United Nations]\n\ngenocide convention when at the\n\nsame time our government has\n\nsided with Germany. [The government] violated our rights not to\n\nparticipate in the negotiations by\n\nagreeing that Germany has not\n\ncommitted genocide in Namibia\n\nand agreeing that Germany must\n\nonly pay bilateral arrangements,\n\ndevelopment programmes, instead\n\nof reparations. I think it is a bit\n\nhypocritical from the president\n\nright now,â he said.\n\nStrong and blunt\n\nAccording to Professor Henning\n\nMelber, Geingobâs tone towards\n\nGermany was unusually strong\n\nand blunt, and not in line with his\n\nusual diplomatic way.\n\nâI think it simply highlights the\n\noffence Namibians took and the\n\npresident voiced - in a rather blunt\n\nway - the utter frustration that exists amongst a majority of Namibians when they look at the German\n\nattitude they consider as arrogance, hypocrisy, moral double\n\nstandards.\n\nâNamibians were confronted all\n\nthe time with Germanyâs lecturing\n\nduring the last year when Germany finally admitted that what happened in the beginning of the 20th\n\ncentury was, in todayâs perspective, a genocide,â he said.\n\nMelber added that Germanyâs argument that the Nama and Ovaherero genocide cannot be compared to the holocaust showed a\n\ntotal lack of empathy.\n\nProblematic\n\nMeanwhile, Matthias Goldmann,\n\na senior research fellow at the Max\n\nPlanck Institute for Comparative\n\nPublic Law and International Law\n\nin Heidelberg, Germany, said Germans underestimated how their\n\nlecturing the world on genocide\n\nwould be seen by their victims.\n\nâDue to Germanyâs history, there\n\nis a reason why this is concerning.\n\nWhat I found particularly problematic is the way they framed\n\nSouth Africaâs complaint as an\n\ninstrumentalisation of the International Court of Justice, which\n\nmeans it is an illegitimate suit -\n\nsomething that should not have\n\nhappened.â\n\n[email protected]\n\nNO HOLDS BARRED: President Hage\n\nGeingob.

This\n\nis equivalent to 50 cubic metres\n\nper hour based on the norm of 100\n\nlitres per day, assuming the boreholes pump water for 20 hours a\n\nday,â he said.\n\nâCurrently, there is no water\n\nshortage, but the demand for water exceeds the available supply of\n\n50 cubic metres per hour. âThat is\n\nwhy the City drilled the first borehole and plans for another six,â he\n\nexplained.\n\nPopulation growth\n\nCurrently, there are currently\n\nmany more people residing in\n\nGroot Aub than the 10 000 for\n\nwhom the City had to provide\n\nwater.\n\nThere are also numerous plots\n\nin and around Groot Aub, adding\n\nadditional pressure on the available water resources.\n\nIn 2018, the City had already\n\ndrilled five boreholes.

Agriculture ministry spokesperson Jona\n\nMusheko said the ministry will attend to Venaaniâs concern.\n\nFirst phase\n\nIt was reported last year that the\n\nsecond phase of the ongoing multibillion-dollar Neckartal irrigation\n\nproject will cost taxpayers an additional N$2.4 billion.\n\nThe initial phase of the project\n\nwas completed at a cost of N$5.6\n\nbillion in 2018.\n\nThe first phase of the project includes close to 19 000 hectares of\n\nland purchased in the ||Karas region between 2013 and 2018.\n\nThe agriculture ministry has\n\nbeen allocated a total of N$2.4 billion for the 2023/24 financial year,\n\na 22.1% increase from last year for\n\nthe second phase, which requires\n\nbuilding canals, spill points and\n\nbooster pump stations.\n\nNeckartal is the largest dam in\n\nthe country, with almost twice the\n\ntotal capacity of existing major\n\ndams. Its current water level stands\n\nat 89.1%.\n\nSchlettwein previously said the\n\nproject will create about 12 600\n\npermanent and seasonal jobs for\n\nthe envisaged irrigation schemes.\n\nGreat potential\n\nThe ministry conducted a feasibility study in 2010 and identifiedmore than 5 000 hectares of irrigable land on the southern and northern sides of the B4 road, between Keetmanshoop and LÃ¼deritz, eastof Seeheim.\n\nThe irrigable land is estimated tobe approximately 4 250 hectares, or 85% of the required 5 000 hectares.\n\nIt has a storage capacity of approximately three times that of the Hardap damâs volume. At full supply level, it has a storage volume of 857 million cubic metres of water.\n\nThe dam also stretches for morethan 38 kilometres upstream andhas a circumference at full supplylevel of more than 290 km.\n\nIn addition, it has the potential to generate 3.5 MV of power, whichwill then be ploughed back into thenational power grid.\n\nCAPACITY: The Neckartal Dam has a storage volume of 857 million cubic metres of water.

Roots began eight years ago\n\nwith a dream by Johan Rieckert.\n\nâHis dream was for Namibia to become independent in terms of food\n\nsecurity. We import most of our\n\nfood, and so money goes out of the\n\ncountry. This is where Roots Namibia wants to make a difference\n\nand is actively doing so. Through\n\nthe Roots project, numerous job\n\nopportunities have been created in\n\nthe Stampriet area,â said Theresa\n\nGreeff, head of marketing and sales\n\nat Roots.\n\nDuring Covid-19, various types of\n\nchilli peppers were harvested at\n\nRoots, and Rieckert took them to\n\nAnneke Jacobs, asking if she could\n\nmake something with them.\n\nâAnneke had a lot of time on her\n\nhands and occupied herself with\n\nthe chilli peppers and the making of sauces. Together with Johan, they refined and adapted the\n\nsauces to what we are exporting to\n\nFrance today.â\n\nGreeff explained that a visitor to\n\nRoots tasted the sauces and was\n\nvery impressed.\n\nâHe said there is a massive market\n\nin France and ordered 200 000\n\nbottles, the first of which were\n\nshipped in December and are selling like hotcakes.â\n\nA fresh taste of Namibia\n\nThe next 30 000 bottles are almost\n\nready and will be sent at the end of\n\nMarch. The subsequent shipments\n\nwill follow in June until the entire\n\norder is delivered.\n\nâIn the next shipment, we will be\n\nadding the creamy chilli sauce. So,\n\nwe will be sending four different\n\nsauces each time, introducing a\n\nnew sauce that has been created,\n\ntested and refined to the shipment.\n\nRoots is currently exploring the\n\nSouth African and Canadian markets for export.\n\nâOur apples and grapes are also\n\njuiced, and they will soon be on\n\nNamibian store shelves.

I want to start with the issues\n\non which I am in agreement with\n\nthe good professor before I discuss\n\nthose issues on which I beg to differ with her.\n\nShe states that â...many Namibians whose proficiency in English is\n\npoor can speak, read and write Afrikaans very well.â\n\nI would give her the benefit of\n\nthe doubt here, although it is a\n\nproblematic statement because, in\n\nmy opinion, this will only apply to\n\nthose who were educated before independence.\n\nShe further states that â...Afrikaans is the mother tongue of Coloured people, the Rehoboth Basters\n\nand some of the whites, but it is spoken by the majority of white people.\n\nIt is also the writing and reading\n\nlanguage of most Khoekhoegowab\n\nspeakers. Next to Oshiwambo and\n\nKhoekhoegowab, it is the most\n\nwidely-spoken [mother tongue] in\n\nNamibia.â I fully agree with that.\n\nQuoting Klaus Dierks, she also\n\nargues that since 1796, when the\n\nOorlam Afrikaners (a Nama subethnic group) crossed the border\n\nfrom South Africa to Namibia, Afrikaans has served as the language\n\nof interracial and inter-ethnic communication in Namibia for the last\n\n227 years. This is a strong point,\n\ncontrary to popular opinion that\n\nAfrikaans was introduced by white\n\nAfrikaners in Namibia. One could\n\nalso add that Afrikaans is used by\n\nmost Khoekhoegowab speakers, not\n\nGerson Uaripi Tjihenuna. PHOTO: CONTRIBUTED\n\nonly as their reading and writing\n\nlanguage but also as their de facto\n\nsecond language.\n\nLingua franca\n\nA few years ago, I published a piece\n\nin New Era under the heading: âAfrikaans, the language we love to hateâ.\n\nIn it, I made a strong case for Afrikaans as a possible lingua franca\n\nin Namibia. I also went on to argue\n\nthat Afrikaans had resurfaced as a\n\nstreet language employed by young\n\nblack Namibians and is associated\n\nwith âstreet wisdomâ.\n\nGiven the ethnic rivalry caused by\n\nidentity politics amongst black Namibians, I fully agree with the professor that Afrikaans could be the\n\nbest option for a lingua franca.\n\nThe argument by the professor\n\nthat â...the majority of Afrikaans\n\nspeakers in Namibia were not white\n\nracists, but were part of the oppressedâ is a solid one as well. It is\n\ntherefore very parochial for people\n\nto categorise Afrikaans as the language of the former oppressor.\n\nNow that I have laid the framework on the issues with which the\n\nprofessor and I agree, I want to\n\ntouch on those issues I beg to differ with her.\n\nEffective communication tool\n\nReferring to high school dropouts,\n\nthe good professor argues: âMost of\n\nthem do their best to learn to speak\n\nunderstandable English, but it often\n\nsounds more like Namlish.â\n\nThe question is,\n\nhow does Namlish\n\nsound and what is\n\nwrong with that? If\n\nby Namlish, as a perceived shortcoming,\n\nthe professor means\n\nincomprehensible\n\ngrammar, then I\n\nwould not have a problem with that. If, however, she means comprehensible Namibian sentence construction of the English language or Namibian accent, then I would have a serious problem with that. If we can deliver effective and comprehensible communication in Namlish, especially in an informal setting, then,in my opinion, that should do.\n\nFor any person to expect Namibians to speak English with a British accent, for example, borders ona Eurocentric approach to the language debate.\n\nThis is a general statement and Iam not implying that this was whatthe professor meant. Namlish isdeveloping into a distinct variantof English and one does not have tospeak British English to communicate effectively.\n\nThe good professor further argues that â...Namlish may develop into akind of Swahili, eventually spoken by all the Namibian ethnicities.â\n\nThere is nothing wrong with the Swahili example, but in my opinion, Pidgin English, which is spoken inWest Africa, especially in Nigeria,would be a better example. Pidgin English, just like Namlish, is regarded as a variant of English, whereas Swahili is not.\n\nThe professorâs argument that Anglophone, Francophone and Lusophone African countries â...will never achieve more than 50% proficiencyâ in these European languages is, in the absence of empirical evidence, very sweeping. And itis therefore, with all due respect, notgood scholarship.\n\nTo refute the professorâs sweepingstatement, Angola would be a goodexample.\n\nBetween 70 and 80% of Angolans speak Portuguese fluently (https://\n\nwww.quora.com, accessed on 25 December 2023) and most young Angolans that I know, especially thosewho have grown up in the Luanda area, do not speak any African language.\n\n*Gerson Uaripi Tjihenuna is acommissioner of elections, however, the views expressed in thisopinion piece are entirely his andnot those of Electoral Commissionof Namibia (ECN).\n\nCAPTURING\n\nNATUREâS\n\nDISAPPEARING\n\nFIERCE BEAUTY\n\nThe 59th Wildlife Photographer\n\nof the Year competition welcomed 49 957 entries from 95\n\ncountries.

His association with\n\nthe club dates back to their Namibia Football Association Khomas second division days, where\n\nShalulile played a pivotal role in\n\nsecuring promotion during the\n\n2011â2012 season.\n\nRemarkable work\n\nShalulileâs ascent through the\n\nranks was nothing short of remarkable. From the under-20\n\nsquad to donning the national\n\ncolours for the Namibia national team, the Brave Warriors, he\n\nshowcased his scoring prowess\n\nin crucial moments and is the\n\ncurrent captain.\n\nThe highlight came\n\nin 2015, when he played an instrumental role in guiding Namibia to their first-ever trophy â\n\nthe Cosafa Cup.\n\nThe talented forward later\n\njoined Highlands Park, propelling them from the South African second tier to the premiership. His goalscoring exploits\n\ndidnât go unnoticed, prompting\n\nMamelodi Sundowns to secure\n\nhis services midway through the\n\n2019â20 season. Shalulile finished the season as the joint top\n\ngoalscorer alongside Orlando\n\nPiratesâ Gabadinho Mhango,\n\nunderscoring his lethal finishing\n\nability.\n\nAccolades\n\nShalulileâs time with Sundowns\n\nhas been nothing short of spectacular. He has amassed a collection of accolades, including the\n\nprestigious Premiership Footballer of the Year (2020â21),\n\nPremiership Top Goalscorer\n\n(2020â21), Premiership Footballer of the Season (2021â22),\n\nPremiership Playersâ Player of\n\nthe Season (2021â22), and Top\n\nGoalscorer (2021â22).\n\nVital player\n\nAs the 2024 Africa Cup of Nations (Afcon) unfolds, Namibia\n\nfinds itself banking on the goalscoring prowess of its star player.\n\nShalulile, having netted an impressive 16 goals for the Brave\n\nWarriors, remains a key asset for\n\nthe national team. His last goal,\n\na testament to his skill and tenacity, came in Namibiaâs Afcon\n\nqualifier against Burundi on 20\n\nJune 2023.\n\nNamibiaâs hopes at Afcon are undoubtedly pinned on the shoulders of Shalulile, whose ability to\n\nfind the back of the net and inspire his teammatesâ makes him\n\na vital component of the squad.\n\nAthletics Namibia president Erwin Naimhwaka\n\nlists the associationâs\n\npriorities and plans\n\nfor the upcoming year.\n\nAthletics Namibia\n\nprioritises growth\n\nâ¢ VISION FOR A STELLAR YEAR\n\nLIMBA MUPETAMI\n\nWINDHOEK\n\nWith the aim of improving\n\nservice delivery, Athletics\n\nNamibia (AN) president\n\nErwin Naimhwaka says the organisation has identified specific priorities, including major events, development plans, talent identification\n\nand planned collaborations to reach\n\ntheir goal.\n\n1.Priorities and strategic\n\nobjectives:\n\nNaimhwaka highlighted a focus on\n\ncreating strong teams for continental\n\ncompetitions, providing ideal opportunities for athletes to qualify for the\n\nOlympic Games in 2024.

Paladin Energy plans to\n\nreopen its Langer Heinrich mine in\n\nquarter 1 of 2024, which will bring\n\nthe number of operating uranium\n\nmines in Namibia back to three,â\n\nPSG said.\n\nOil and gas\n\nexploration frenzy\n\nRenewed interest in Namibia as an\n\noil and gas exploration destination\n\nwould also largely see the deployment\n\nof drilling rigs to Namibia, PSG said.\n\nâLooking ahead, continued growth\n\nin oil exploration is probable, as the\n\nMinister of Mines and Energy has\n\nstated that as many as five oil drilling\n\nrigs could be operating in the Orange\n\nBasin at the start of the year â up from\n\na record three in 2023. The Orange\n\nBasin could attract further interest\n\nfrom oil companies if TotalEnergiesâs and Shellâs oil well appraisals\n\nin the first half of 2024 yield positive\n\nresults,â PSG said.\n\nThe phased closure of the B2Goldâs\n\nOtjikoto Gold Mine would affect the\n\nmining sector, notably gold production, PSG said. The slow in demand\n\nfor diamonds would also affect the\n\nsector, with expectations that mining\n\ncompany De Beers that is likely to\n\ncurb supply in 2024.\n\nSo long, B2Gold\n\nâWe anticipate a slowdown in gold\n\nand diamond mining in 2024.

As mentioned\n\nbefore in our Economic Focus report\n\nin November, the diamond market is\n\nfacing low prices and several other\n\nchallenges, which will prompt De\n\nBeers to curb supply to diamond\n\nbuyers in 2024,â it said.\n\nThe tourism sector and demand for\n\ncredit domestically is also viewed as a\n\nfactor likely driving growth in 2024,\n\nPSG said.\n\nâThe robust expansion in the mining\n\nsector is gradually paving the way for\n\nenhanced activity and improved earnings in the broader economy. While\n\ncurrent indicators such as credit\n\ndemand and domestic tourism may\n\nnot fully reflect this progress, they\n\nare poised for a positive shift.

However,\n\nthis reliance on natural resources also\n\nleaves the economy vulnerable to external market fluctuations,â Simonis\n\nStorm said.\n\nPolicymakers were advised to turn\n\nNamibiaâs focus towards diversifying its economic activities to guard\n\nagainst future economic shocks.\n\nâNamibiaâs economic success will\n\ndepend on diversifying its economic activities, managing external vulnerabilities, and fostering sustainable growth across all sectors.

This reflects a notable slowdown from the\n\n7.6% recorded in 2022, but has been\n\nrevised upwards from the initial\n\nAugust 2023 projection of 3.3%.\n\nThe slowdown in 2023 is attributed to diminished demand in\n\nboth global and\n\ndomestic\n\neconomies,\n\ninfluenced by\n\nelevated inflation rates\n\nand soaring\n\ninterest rates\n\nthat adversely\n\naffect consumer spending.\n\nAdditionally,\n\nthe high base\n\neffects from\n\nthe mining industry, especially diamond\n\nmining and\n\nother mining activities, contribute to the deceleration.\n\nPrimary sector\n\nProjections indicate a dip in the\n\ngrowth of primary industries in\n\n2023, mainly due to reduced expansion in diamond mining and other\n\nmining and quarrying activities.\n\nEstimated growth rates stand at\n\n8.6% and 4.7% for 2023 and 2024,\n\nrespectively,representingamoderation from the elevated base of 30%\n\nrecorded in 2022.\n\nDiamonds\n\nThe diamond\n\nmining industry is anticipating a\n\nsignificant\n\ndecrease in\n\ngrowth in\n\n2023,\n\npri -\n\nmar -\n\nily influenced by\n\ndiminished\n\nproduc -\n\ntion levels\n\nstemming\n\nfrom declining international prices.\n\nProjections\n\nindicate a growth rate of 5.5% and\n\n9.7% in 2023 and 2024, respectively, marking a substantial deterioration from the robust 45.1% growth\n\nrecorded in 2022.\n\nUranium\n\nProjections suggest an expansion in\n\nthe uranium mining sector for 2023,\n\nfollowedbyamoderationingrowthfor 2024. Anticipated to surge by\n\n14.8% in 2023, the sector is poised\n\nfor subsequent moderation with a\n\ngrowth rate of 3% in 2024, reflecting\n\nthe industryâs recovery from water\n\nsupply interruptions.\n\nMetal ores\n\nThe metal ores sub-sector is poised\n\nfor a robust recovery in 2023, with\n\nprojections indicating an expansion\n\nof 24.1%, followed by a moderated\n\ngrowth of 7.5% in 2024.\n\nThe surge in gold production is\n\ncredited to the extraction of higher-grade ore across all operational\n\nmines.\n\nQuarrying\n\nProjections indicate a moderation in\n\ngrowth for other mining and quarrying activities, encompassing oil\n\nexploration, in the years 2023 and\n\n2024.\n\nThe sub-sector is expected to\n\nwitness growth rates of 35.3% and\n\n5% in 2023 and 2024, respectively, marking a substantial reduction\n\nfrom the remarkable 144.2% growth\n\nrecorded in 2022.\n\nThe slowdown in 2023 is attributed to projections indicating a more\n\nrestrained increase in exploratory\n\neffortscomparedtopreviousyears.Driving economy in 2024\n\nPHOTO UNSPLASH/ALBERT HYSENI\n\nGoldman Sachs\n\nbacks rand, sees\n\nâroom to runâ\n\nGoldman Sachs Group has added\n\nits voice to a chorus of expectations of a weaker dollar after the\n\nUS central bankâs clearest sign yet\n\nthat interest-rate cuts are coming.\n\nGoldman made sweeping changes\n\nto its exchange-rate forecasts after\n\nthe Federal Reserve signalled a\n\nmore-rapid move to ânon-recessionaryâ interest-rate cuts, analysts including Michael Cahill\n\nwrote in a note.\n\nFor the first time since September,\n\nhedge funds and other large speculators switched to a net short position against the US dollar as of\n\n12 December, according to Commodity Futures Trading Commission data.\n\nThe Bloomberg Dollar Spot Index\n\ndropped 1.2% last week and\n\ntouched a four-month low after the\n\nFed held interest rates and projected 75 basis points of reductions\n\nin 2024.

Those were the\n\nbiggest gains among G-10 currencies outside of Norwayâs krone,\n\nwhich jumped more than 4% as its\n\ncentral bank unexpectedly lifted its\n\nkey deposit rate.\n\nGoldman sees the yen little\n\nchanged at 142 per US dollar in six\n\nmonths, significantly stronger than\n\nits prior estimate of 155.\n\nIt also boosted projections for\n\nthe Australian and New Zealand\n\ndollars by at least 9% over the same\n\nhorizon.\n\nâWe see the most âroom to runâ\n\nfrom current levels in pro-cyclical currencies that should benefit\n\nfrom the Fed loosening its grip on\n\nfinancial conditions and adding\n\nto the case for a soft landing,â the\n\nstrategists wrote.\n\nThat group includes the British\n\npound, the South Korean won and\n\nthe South African rand.\n\nâ Fin24/Bloomberg\n\nGoldman Sachs has made sweeping changes to its exchange-rate\n\nforecasts after the Federal Reserve signalled a more-rapid move to ânonrecessionaryâ interest-rate cuts.

This follows a\n\nsubstantial 354.4% surge reported in\n\nthe corresponding quarter of 2022.\n\nThe remarkable growth can be attributed primarily to continued investments in oil exploration within\n\nthe country, signaling a positive trend\n\nin the mining exploration industry.\n\nMetal ores, diamonds\n\nThe metal ores subsector reported\n\ndouble-digit growth of 33.4%. This\n\nstands in stark contrast to the decline\n\nof 22.6% observed in the corresponding quarter of 2022.\n\nThe stellar performance in the subsector is credited to a substantial increase in the production of gold, signaling a positive trajectory for the\n\nmetal ores industry.\n\nThe diamond mining subsector registered a marginal decrease of 0.2%\n\nin its growth rate in real value added.\n\nThis marks the first downturn in nine\n\nconsecutive quarters, presenting a\n\nstark contrast to the 32.6% growth\n\nwitnessed during the same quarter\n\nin 2022.\n\nAgriculture\n\nThe agriculture and forestry sector\n\nwitnessed growth of 19.9% in the past\n\nquarter, compared to a deceleration\n\nof 10.6% recorded in the corresponding quarter of 2022.\n\nThe NSA attributed the upsurge\n\nto the livestock farming subseca decline of 45.7% recorded in the corresponding quarter of 2022.\n\nTrade\n\nThe wholesale and retail trade sectorâs economic activities increased\n\nby 6.1% in real value added during\n\nthe past quarter, compared to an increase of 11.3% registered in the corresponding quarter of 2022.\n\nThe sectorâs growth trajectory\n\ncontinued for the tenth consecutive\n\nquarter.\n\nâThe performance of the sector is\n\nreflected in the revenue of wholesalers and retailers that stood at N$17.0\n\nbillion compared to N$15.3 billion\n\nobserved in the third quarter of 2022.\n\nThis is a nominal increase of 11.1%\n\ncompared to a growth of 17.9% recorded in the same quarter of 2022,â\n\nthe NSA said.\n\nTourism\n\nThe hotels and restaurants sector â a\n\nproxy for tourism â recorded growth\n\nof 6.4% in real value added during the\n\npast quarter, compared to an increase\n\nof 3.2% in the same quarter of 2022.\n\nâThe sectorâs growth is reflected the\n\nincrease in number of travellers from\n\ninternational, regional and domestic destinations, who demanded for\n\nhotels and restaurants services.

Namibia is doing the âYear of\n\nRevivalâ right. Numbers donât lie; we\n\nare a resurgent nation and punching\n\nabove our weight.\n\nThe interest, investments and activities in the energy sector, both renewables and oil and gas, mean our nationâs\n\nfuture looks positive. As always, there\n\nis a caveat: we must remember the\n\neconomyâs fundamentals.\n\nTough times\n\nNamibia as a country and us as a population have come through a challenging period marked by drought,\n\neconomic downturn and Covid-19.\n\nEconomically, socially and individually, the impact was severe. Jobs were\n\nlost, we lost loved ones to Covid-19,\n\nthe economy took a major hit, and\n\ncompanies went bankrupt.\n\nA positive turnaround was certainly\n\nnot inevitable, and from an economic\n\nstandpoint, we had to reimagine and\n\nreinvent our economy.

Even more\n\nimportantly, we as Namibians needed\n\ntobecomeârevitalisedâ.Ubuntu\n\nOur populations needed to know, understand and process what we had\n\ngone through in the last few years.\n\nPart of becoming a revitalised nation\n\nmeant healing from the knocks we\n\ntook and adversity we faced.\n\nA revitalised nation needs a resilient population, which is easier said\n\nthan done. You canât just shake off the\n\ndeaths of loved ones or create a new\n\njob out of thin air.\n\nWe owe it to ourselves to work together as a nation, pulling in the same\n\ndirection toward success.\n\nThe true spirit of âUbuntuâ comes to\n\nmind. Engaging and supporting each\n\nother, talking about the pressures and\n\nchallenges we feel and embracing our\n\nhealing is as important as getting our\n\neconomy back on its feet.\n\nA resurgent nation needs to be mentally fit, strong and ready to take on\n\nthe massive challenges of economic\n\ngrowth.\n\nInvestment\n\nIn my new role as the chief executive\n\nofficer of the Development Bank of\n\nNamibia (DBN), where I took over\n\nfrom my excellent predecessors, we\n\nare taking a holistic approach to developing the economy and how entrepreneurs can become successful.\n\nInvesting in business ideas and concepts is essential for growth and development.\n\nHowever,thepeoplerunningthesebusinesses need to be well-rounded and understand that running a\n\nbusiness is not just about making a\n\nquick buck.\n\nCreating a nurturing environment\n\nwhere employers and employees can\n\nthrive and create a solid and longterm business that is destined for\n\ngrowth and will contribute to growing\n\nthe Namibian economy and labour\n\nforce is essential.\n\nIt speaks to the true essence of\n\nrevival and of a resurgent populace.\n\nIt is the true embodiment of Ubuntu\n\nand Harambee, as has been championed by our President.\n\nOn an annual basis, production of milk in\n\nNamibia declined during the past quarter\n\nmainly due to an increase in the cost of\n\nanimal feed, but milk output rose on a\n\nquarterly basis.

The downturn\n\nin the wholesale and retail\n\ntrade sector was particularly pronounced in clothing and\n\nvehicle subsectors, the BoN said.\n\nOn a quarterly basis, the manufacturing sector continued its\n\nupward trajectory, registering a\n\n1.7% increase in employment.\n\nMeanwhile, the wholesale and\n\nretail trade sector faced a 0.3%\n\ndecline in employment during\n\nthe same period.\n\nWages\n\nThe wholesale and retail trade\n\nGRAPHS BANK OF NAMIBIA\n\nNamibia guzzles more fuel\n\nNamibia consumed 304.2 million litres of fuel in the past quarter, 13.6% more than the same three months last year.\n\nAccording to the Bank of Namibia (BoN), the rise was reflected in the increased consumption of both diesel and\n\npetrol by 14.9% and 10.5%, respectively. The rise in the fuel consumption partly suggests the uptick in the economic\n\nactivities for both industries and households, the central bank said. Quarter-on-quarter, the total fuel consumption\n\nincreasedby8.8%duringthepastquarter.PHOTOUNSPLASH/DAWNMCDONALDOil perks up as Red Sea tensions\n\nspark investor jitters\n\nGlobal oil benchmark Brent\n\ntopped US$80 a barrel yesterday amid jitters over global\n\ntrade disruption and geopolitical\n\ntensions in the Middle East following attacks on ships by Yemenâs\n\nIran-aligned Houthi forces in the\n\nRed Sea.\n\nBrent crude futures rose 89 cents,\n\nor 1.1%, at US$80.12 a barrel by\n\n1101 GMT, while US West Texas\n\nIntermediate crude climbed 93\n\ncents, or 1.3%, to US$74.87 a\n\nbarrel.\n\nThe benchmarks closed up more\n\nthan 1% on Tuesday as some companies rerouted vessels, with longer\n\nvoyages increasing the cost of\n\ntransport and insurance.\n\nYesterday, Greece advised commercial vessels sailing in the Red\n\nSea and the Gulf of Aden to avoid\n\nYemeni waters. Greek ship-owners\n\ncontrol about 20% of the worldâs\n\ncommercial vessels in terms of carrying capacity.\n\nTask force\n\nMeanwhile, Washington on\n\nTuesday launched a task force to\n\nsafeguard commerce in the region.\n\nâThus far, the US-led naval mission\n\nto mitigate Houthi attacks has\n\nfailed to ease broad concerns of\n\nsafe passage through the Red Sea,\n\nwith major maritime carriers still\n\nchoosing to steer clear amid the\n\ntensions,â said Yeap Jun Rong,\n\nmarket strategist at IG.\n\nThe Houthis vowed to defy the\n\nUS-led naval mission and to keep\n\ntargeting Red Sea shipping in\n\nsupport of Palestinian enclave\n\nGazaâs ruling Hamas movement.\n\nAbout 12% of world shipping traffic\n\npasses up the Red Sea and through\n\nthe Suez Canal.
