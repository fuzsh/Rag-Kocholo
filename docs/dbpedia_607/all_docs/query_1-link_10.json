        "text": "By Bob Greene\n\nSTARS\n\nStanislas Wawrinka beat David Ferrer 6-1 6-4 to win the Portugal Open men’s singles in Oeiras, Portugal\n\nTommy Haas beat Philipp Kohlschreiber 6-3 7-6 (3) to win the BMW Open in Munich, Germany\n\nAnastasia Pavlyuchenkova beat Carla Suárez Navarro 7-5 6-2 to win the women’s singles at the Portugal Open in Oeiras, Portugal\n\nAdrian Ungur beat Diego Sebastian Schwartzman, 4-6 6-0 6-2 to win the Tunis Open in Tunis, Tunisia\n\nJiri Vesely beat Steve Darcis 6-4 6-4 to win the Prosperita Open 2013 in Ostrava, Czech Republic\n\nVasek Pospisil beat Michal Przysiezny 6-7 (7) 6-0 6-1 to win the Soweto Open in Johannesburg, South Africa\n\nSAYING\n\n“It’s a sensational feeling to be quite honest. It was another one of those milestones that I hoped for, to maybe win this title one year. To have done that, this late in my career, is a big highlight for me.” – Tommy Haas, after winning the BMW Open.\n\n“It feels great to have won a title again, as it was one of my goals at the start of the year. It was a challenge against a top four player. I am very happy with the way I played today. I was really focused and I made it difficult for him on my serve.” – Stanislas Wawrinka, after upsetting David Ferrer to win the Portugal Open men’s singles.\n\n“Stan played a great match. I was never close to winning.” – David Ferrer.\n\n“She was holding me back on the baseline, putting a lot of spin on the ball and moving me around. But I just tried to start playing point by point, fighting every point. It wasn’t easy, but I just tried to dig deep and fight, and that really helped me in the end.” – Anastasia Pavlyuchenkova, who won the Portugal Open women’s title by beating Carla Suárez Navarro.\n\n“Today I had chances to win the first set, but Nastia was playing so well at those moments, and then she played really, really well in the second set. She just kept getting better as the match went on and deserved to win today. But it was a really good week for me. I’m very happy I was able to make another final here.” – Carla Suárez Navarro.\n\n“I think today both of us were so nervous and so tight. We’re just glad it’s finally over. It wasn’t the prettiest match for both teams, but we had some good points and definitely happy to win.” – Dmitry Tursunov, who teamed with Jarkko Nieminen to win the doubles in Munich, Germany.\n\n“It feels extremely good. I don’t have that many (doubles) titles.” – Jarkko Nieminen, who won his third career ATP World Tour doubles crown.\n\nBrad Drewett\n\n“Today is a very sad day for sport and tennis in particular. Our president Brad has passed away.” – Rafael Nadal.\n\n“He was always very nice to work with. Very honest and gentle. For me, it was hard seeing him not be the same anymore towards the end physically. But we can only appreciate what he’s done for us and what he did until the last moment he really possibly could. That will never go away.” – Roger Federer.\n\n“He was a very brave man with the courage to stand up and try to change some things in our sport for the better. We remember him as a very calm, composed and intelligent man who loved this sport with all his heart while he was playing, coaching, and then as the president of ATP.” – Novak Djokovic.\n\n“His knowledge, experience and enthusiasm will be a great loss to the whole sport.” – Francesco Ricci Bitti, International Tennis Federation (ITF) president.\n\n“The recent prize money increases with the Grand Slams are perfect examples of Brad’s brilliant strategic management, and another example of how much he cared about our athletes and the sport’s long-term growth. His legacy as a leader, as a person, and as a father who always put his family first, will have an everlasting impact on tennis.” – Stacey Allaster, WTA Chairman and CEO.\n\n“The tennis world lost a strong leader, true gentleman and a great friend today in ATP Executive Chairman and President Brad Drewett. Brad left an indelible mark on the game and everyone who knew him.” –David Haggerty, USTA chairman, CEO and president.\n\n“Tennis has lost a great leader and human being who accomplished so much for the sport he loved.” – Ken Solomon, Tennis Channel chairman and CEO.\n\nSAD NEWS\n\nBrad Drewett, a player, tournament director and executive chairman and president of the ATP, lost his battle with motor neurone disease, also referred to as Lou Gehrig’s Disease. He was 54. The Australian has been credited with making a number of changes within tennis and securing a greater share of Grand Slam tournament revenue for players as well as growing the sport in Asia. Recently, he was listed by the Sports Business Journal as one of the 50 most influential people in sport. Before he retired from playing in 1990, Drewett was ranked in the top 40 in singles and top 20 in doubles. In 2006, he was named ATP Chief Executive Officer for the International Group, overseeing the operations in the Middle East, Asia and Pacific regions. From 2003 to 2005 he led the region as Managing Director. In January 2012, he was named ATP executive chairman and president. This past January, he announced he had amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, a disease that affects voluntary muscle activity, including speaking, walking, breathing and swallowing. When he announced a new sponsor on the opening day of the Australian Open, his speech was noticeably slurred. He had planned to step down once a successor was found. He died at his home in Sydney, Australia.\n\nSENIOR STUD\n\nAge is just a number to Tommy Haas. In his 10th attempt at the Munich, Germany, tournament, the 35-year-old won the BMW Open for the first time. And he beat defending champion Philipp Kohlschreiber in the first all-German final in Munich in 48 years. “I can hardly believe that I still managed to win here after such a long career,” Haas said. He became the first 35-year-old to win an ATP Tour title since Fabrice Santoro captured Newport, Rhode Island, USA, in 2008. It was Haas’s fourth title in Germany and 14th overall. With the victory, Haas will move up to 13th in the world rankings. So far this year Haas has reached the final in San Jose, California, USA, and upset top-ranked Novak Djokovic in his run to the semifinals in Miami, Florida, USA. “Every time you win a title, it’s a reflection of putting everything together the whole week,” Haas said. “It doesn’t happen that often. You’re really proud of those moments.”\n\nSTAN’S THE MAN\n\nSwitzerland’s Stanislas Wawrinka, playing aggressively right from the start, dominated their baseline rallies to upset top-seeded David Ferrer and win the Portugal Open. “Stan played pretty well from the baseline and he had a good percentage of first services. He surpassed me in everything,” Ferrer said after losing to Wawrinka for just the fourth time in 11 career meetings. The winner won the first five games of the match and closed out the opening set in 30 minutes. With the two tied at 4 in the second set, Wawrinka broke Ferrer at 30, then held to capture his fourth career ATP World Tour title and first of 2013. “It is going to be tough to return to the Top 10, but I am definitely playing better than last year and I am improving,” said Wawrinka, who is ranked 16th in the world. “Today I got the confidence that I can beat a top four player in a final on a clay court.”\n\nSICK CALL\n\nJuan Martin del Potro withdrew from the Madrid Open because of a viral infection. Last year the Argentine reached the semifinals at the Spanish clay court event. “He has a virus and will not be fit to play. We wish him a fast recovery,” a statement on the tournament’s website said. David Goffin of Belgium took del Potro’s place in the main draw.\n\nSIDELINED\n\nBig-serving Ivo Karlovic of Croatia is recovering in a hospital in Miami, Florida, USA after being admitted with viral meningitis. Ranked as high as 14th in the world at one time, Karlovic was rumored to have suffered a stroke. But his wife Alsi said it wasn’t true. “Ivo did not have a stroke, as some outlets have stated,” she said in a statement released by the ATP Tour. “Rather, he has viral meningitis. We ask for privacy during his recovery process. We thank everyone for their support and well wishes.” The 6-foot-10 (2.08m) Karlovic last played at a Challenger in Sarasota, Florida, USA, last month.\n\nSTRING CONTINUES\n\nFor a while it looked as if Carla Suárez Navarro was finally going to beat Anastasia Pavlyuchenkova and win a tournament title. Both would be firsts for the Spaniard. Alas, neither was to be. Suárez Navarro took a 5-3 lead in the opening set. But Pavlyuchenkova staved off three set points – one in the ninth game and two more in the 10th – before winning 10 of the last 12 games of the match. “I had a slow start, the Russian said. “I was a little bit disappointed about that. It was the third match this week I started like that. Also, Carla was playing really well.” The winner called her coach – Martina Hingis – onto the court in the first set. “I think I just needed some positive words from Martina out there,” Pavlyuchenkova said. It paid off as she beat Suárez Navarro for the fifth time without a loss and captured her fifth career title – her first on clay. Suárez Navarro fell to 0-5 in WTA finals.\n\nSTOPPED BY BACK\n\nA back problem has caused Venus Williams to withdraw from the Madrid Open. The 32-year-old American, once ranked number one in the world, pulled out of the clay-court event before her first-round match against Spanish wild card Anabel Medina Garrigues. Williams was replaced in the draw by Switzerland’s Stefanie Voegele, who lost to Medina Garrigues 6-3 6-3.\n\nSENT TO JAIL?\n\nEuropean media is reporting that Bernard Tomic’s father, John, has been arrested after allegedly head-butting his son’s training partner, Thomas Drouet. There are reports that the 29-year-old Drouet’s nose was broken after the former tour player tried to break up an argument between the Tomics. In a statement, Tennis Australia said it was working closely with ATP officials who are investigating the incident. The ruckus reportedly occurred after Bernard Tomic suffered his third first-round loss of the year, this time to Czech veteran Radek Stepanek at the Madrid Open.\n\nSAYS NO\n\nThe International Tennis Federation (ITF) backed the referee who awarded a Davis Cup Asia/Oceania Group II tie to New Zealand because of an unplayable court. Pakistan was defaulted when their home tie played in Myanmar was halted because of a hole in the court. Pakistan had won the first match and was leading in the second when referee Ashita Ajigala of Sri Lanka ruled that the grass court in Yangon had become unplayable and dangerous. The Pakistan Tennis Federation (PTF) appealed the ruling, but the ITF’s Davis Cup Committee upheld the referee’s decision. There were only two grass courts at the facility where the tie was played. “The Committee noted that the poor quality of the original match court led the referee to designate the practice court as the match court,” the ITF said in its statement. The tie was played in Myanmar after New Zealand refused to visit Pakistan because of safety concerns. The PTF could still appeal to the ITF Board of Directors, the ITF statement said.\n\nSET FOR PARIS\n\nAlex Kuznetsov and Shelby Rogers have earned wild cards into the main draw at the French Open. Kuznetsov received the men’s wild card by having the best combined results at clay court Challenger tournaments in Sarasota and Tallahassee, Florida, USA, as well as Savannah, Georgia, USA. Rogers earned her wild card in the women’s singles main draw by accumulating the greatest number of WTA ranking points at two of the three USTA Pro Circuit USD $50,000 clay-court events in Dothan, Alabama; Charlottesville, Virginia, and Indian Harbour Beach, Florida, USA. The 26-year-old Kuznetsov was the junior runner-up at Roland Garros in 2004. When she was a junior, the 20-yearold Rogers won the USTA Girls’ 18s National Championship to earn a wild card into the main draw of the 2010 US Open, her only appearance in a Grand Slam tournament main draw.\n\nSHOWTIME FOR SISTERS\n\nA documentary about the Williams sisters in 2011 – Venus and Serena – will have its theatrical release this week. Serena, in a video introduction that will be shown at a theater in New York City, says that 2011 was “one of the most difficult years of my whole entire life.” The New York screening will be hosted by Billie Jean King and John McEnroe. Maiken Baird and Michelle Major spent almost four years trying to convince the sisters to participate in the first feature-length documentary on their lives. At the time of the negotiations, Serena and Venus were ranked one and two in the world. But just after the filming began in January 2011, Venus dropped out of the Australian Open with a hip injury, the first time she had ever withdrawn from a Grand Slam tournament. A couple months later, Serena was hospitalized with a pulmonary embolism. By September, Venus announced she had been diagnosed with Sjögren’s syndrome, an autoimmune disease that can cause muscle pain, arthritis and fatigue. The film also deals with their father, Richard Williams, and has little-seen footage from their early days in Compton, California, USA.\n\nSECRETS?\n\nChris Evert has struck back at her former fiancé Jimmy Connors, who hinted in a new book at their relationship ended because she had an abortion. “In his book, Jimmy Connors has written about a time in our relationship that was very personal and emotionally painful,” Evert said in a statement. “I am extremely disappointed that he used the book to misrepresent a private matter that took place 40 years ago and made it public without my knowledge. I hope everyone can understand that I have no further comment.” The two were at the top of tennis when they both won Wimbledon singles titles in 1974 and were due to get married later that year. In his memoir, “The Outsider,” Connors hints he broke off the relationship. “An issue had arisen as a result of youthful passion,” he wrote. “I was perfectly happy to let nature take its course and accept responsibility for what was to come. Chrissie, however, had already made up her mind that the timing was bad and too much was riding on her future. … It was a horrible feeling, but I knew it was over. Getting married wasn’t going to be good for either of us.” Evert was 19 at the time, Connors three years older.\n\nSIGNED UP\n\nDefending champion Marin Cilic, former world number one Lleyton Hewitt and American Sam Querrey will play the AEGON Championships at Queen’s Club in June. The field for the grass-court warm-up for Wimbledon also includes Andy Murray, Tomas Berdych, Juan Martin del Potro and Jo Wilfried Tsonga. The tournament begins June 10. While Cilic will be seeking a second straight title, Hewitt will be going for a record fifth crown. The Australian is tied with Boris Becker, John McEnroe and Andy Roddick with four Queen’s Club titles.\n\nTwo of the players – Andy Murray and Tomas Berdych – are already scheduled to play on finals day. Murray and Tim Henman will play Berdych and Ivan Lendl in Rally Against Cancer, a doubles exhibition to raise money for the Royal Marsden Cancer Charity.\n\nSHOULDER SURGERY\n\nDavid Nalbandian has undergone surgery on his right shoulder. The Argentine’s shoulder was operated on by his personal doctor, Angel Luis Cotorro, in Barcelona, Spain. Nalbandian said he hopes to be recovered in time to play for Argentina against the Czech Republic in a Davis Cup World Group semifinal in September. Doctors have said it will take four months for Nalbandian to recover.\n\nSTRONG FIELD\n\nFor the first time in nine years, Rafael Nadal will play in Roger Federer’s hometown tournament. Organizers of the Swiss Indoors in Basel, Switzerland, said their field for the October 19-27 event will be headed by five-time champion Federer, Nadal and defending champion Juan Martin del Potro. The last time he played in Basel, in 2004, Nadal lost a first-round match to Rainer Schuettler of Germany. He also lost early to another Spaniard, Feliciano Lopez, in 2003, the only year he and Federer were both in the Basel field. The Swiss Indoors, played on carpet then, is now a hard-court tournament.\n\nSUGARPOVA\n\nMaria Sharapova made a one-day trip to Moscow to present her “Sugarpova” candy brand to the Russian market. She has introduced her candy to several other markets, including the United States. But she says tennis remains her main focus. “Right now tennis is the most important for me,” she said. She also said she plans to compete in the 2016 Olympics in Rio de Janeiro. A small pack of “Sugarpova” sweets sells in Moscow for 175 rubles (USD $5.66).\n\nSERVING UP PORSCHES\n\nRumors are floating that the new Porsche 911 4S being driven by Bulgarian tennis star Grigor Dimitrov is a present from Maria Sharapova. The Swiss media is reporting that Dimitrov’s new vehicle is the same car Sharapova received for winning the Porsche Open in Stuttgart, Germany. “I am not a car collector, but my friend is mad about them,” Sharapova said. In his bio, Dimitrov lists cars among his hobbies. Dimitrov, who turns 22 later this month, and the 26-year-old Sharapova have been an item since the start of the year. And while neither player has confirmed the relationship, they haven’t denied it either.\n\nSHARED PERFORMANCES\n\nJohannesburg: Prakash Amritraj and Rajeev Ram bat Purav Raja and Divu Sharan 7-6 (1) 7-6 (1)\n\nMunich: Jarkko Nieminen and Dmitry Tursunov beat Marcos Baghdatis and Eric Butorac 6-1 6-4\n\nOeiras (men): Santiago Gonzalez and Scott Lipsky beat Aisam-Ul-Haq Qureshi and Jean-Julien Rojer 6-3 4-6 10-7 (match tiebreak)\n\nOeiras (women): Chian Hao-Ching and Kristina Mladenovic beat Darija Jurak and Katalin Marosi 7-6 (3) 6-2\n\nOstrava: Steve Darcis and Olivier Rochus beat Tomasz Bednarek and Mateuz Kowalczyk 7-5 7-5\n\nTunis: Domink Meffert and Philipp Oswald beat Jamie Delgado and Andreas Siljestrom 3-6 7-6 (0) 10-7 (match tiebreak)\n\nSURFING\n\nMadrid: www.madrid-open.com/\n\nCagnes-Sur-Mer: www.opendecagnes.com\n\nRome: www.internazionalibnlditalia.com/\n\nPrague: www.spartapragueopen.cz\n\nBordeaux: www.atp-primrosebordeaux.com/\n\nTOURNAMENTS THIS WEEK\n\n(All money in USD)\n\nMEN\n\n$4,404,383 Mutua Madrid Open, Madrid, Spain, clay\n\n$125,000 Kunming Challenger, Kunming, China, hard\n\nWOMEN\n\n$5,273,930 Mutua Madrid Open, clay\n\n$100,000 Open de Cagnes-Sur-Mer Alpes-Maritimes, Cagnes-Sur-Mer, France, clay\n\nTOURNAMENTS NEXT WEEK\n\nMEN\n\n$3,470,878 Internazionali BNL d’Italia, Rome, Italy, clay\n\n$111,351 BNP Paribas Primrose Bordeaux, Bordeaux, France\n\nWOMEN\n\n$2,369,000 Internazionali BNL d’Italia, Rome, Italy, clay\n\n$100,000 Sparta Prague Open, Prague, Czech Republic, clay\n\nBy Bob Greene\n\nSTARS\n\nAustralian Open\n\n(First Week)\n\nEkaterina Makarova beat fifth-seeded Angelique Kerber 7-5 6-4\n\nJeremy Chardy beat sixth-seeded Juan Martin del Potro 6-3 6-3 6-7 (3) 3-6 6-3\n\nCarla Suarez Navarro beat seventh-seeded Sara Errani 6-4 6-4\n\nLaura Robson beat eighth-seeded Petra Kvitova 2-6 6-3 11-9\n\nNicolas Almagro beat eighth-seeded Janko Tipsarevic 6-2 5-1, retired\n\nZheng Jie beat ninth-seeded Samantha Stosur 6-4 1-6 7-5\n\nSAYING\n\n“We are only halfway through the tournament but it felt like a final to me.” – Novak Djokovic, after he survived a tight five-hour, fourth-round battle with Stanislas Wawrinka.\n\n“I think it’s the best match I’ve ever played. At the end I was really close and I was really sad to lose. It was a great disappointment for sure.” – Stanislas Wawrinka, who lost the fifth set 12-10 as he fell to top-ranked Novak Djokovic.\n\n“It was close to being a great day. And now, it’s not such a great day.” – Samantha Stosur, who was two points away from victory before Zheng Jie won five straight games to shock the ninth-seeded Australian 6-4 1-6 7-5.\n\n“When you’re a young person, you just don’t think it’s ever going to end, and you’re on top of the world. Now I realize, all these opportunities, I try to make the best I can of them. I love the game, and while I’m here I’m going to go for it.” – Venus Williams, at the age of 32 in her 19th year on the WTA tour.\n\n“Oh, I’ll be out there. I mean, unless something fatal happens to me, there’s no way I’m not going to be competing. I’m alive. My heart’s beating. I’ll be fine.” – Serena Williams, after injuring her ankle during her first-round victory.\n\n“I’m very happy to win today, but I don’t play for the records. Even when I lose, I still enjoy it. Of course, every time I lose … it’s tough. But still I enjoy playing. I love tennis. I like practice. I like games. I like the tour. I’m enjoy it a lot.” – Kimiko Date Krumm, whose first-round victory over 12th-seeded Nadia Petrova made the 42-year-old the oldest winner of a women’s singles Grand Slam tournament match.\n\n“It’s nothing. Just I eat a lot; I sleep a lot. Last night I was in the bed before 10. I finished the dinner already 7:30. Sleep before 10 like the kids. Because always after the match or after the practice I’m tired, so I need time to recover a lot. So I sleep a lot; I eat healthy foods; I drink a lot. It’s simple life. That’s it. Nothing special.” – Kimiko Date Krumm on her secret of playing so well at the age of 42.\n\n“Whatever word you want to put on it. At 5-2 up in the third, double break probably is a bit of a choke, yeah.” – Samantha Stosur, who twice served for the match as she lost five straight games to fall to China’s Zheng Jie.\n\n“He’s the last person that deserves anything like that, with his five or six surgeries already.” – Sam Querrey, commenting on his second-round opponent, injury-plagued Brian Baker, who retired from their match with a meniscus tear in his right knee.\n\n“I wanted to finish with an ace so I wouldn’t have to play the point.” – Gael Monfils, who double-faulted on four match points before finally defeating Lu Yen-Hsun 7-6 (5) 4-6 0-6 6-1 8-6 in a second-round match.\n\n“I did not expect to hit 207, I was shooting for 200.” – Serena Williams, after hitting a 207 kph (128 mph) serve, the fastest of her career.\n\n“I feel so much emotion. It’s a great moment for me. Everyone dreams of this.” – Jeremy Chady, after upsetting sixth-seeded Juan Martin del Potro.\n\n“It’s not my favorite part of the job, beating up on the hometown heroes.” – Roger Federer, following his straight-sets win over Australian Bernard Tomic.\n\n“A lot of players, when you play these sort of players like Roger (Federer) or Novak (Djokovic), you lose belief before you get into the match. Eighty or 90 percent of players that play the top guys, like with Roger, you lose your belief. I got in there, I started to think after they mentioned all these grand slams leading up – Wimbledon champion six times, six times US Open champion. Then I was, ‘Oh crap, it’s Roger.’ I tried to block out who’s on the other side of the net, but couldn’t quite do it after that announcement.” – Bernard Tomic.\n\nSQUEAKER\n\nIt was the “other” player from Switzerland who nearly knocked defending champion Novak Djokovic out of Australian Open. But by the time the five-hour, two-minute marathon had ended, Djokovic has escaped the upset bid by Stanislas Wawrinka 1-6 7-5 6-4 6-7 12-10. “He deserved equally to be a winner of this match,” Djokovic said of Wawrinka. “I give him a lot of credit. He showed his qualities. He was the aggressive player on the court. He was playing well, mixing it up, using the right tactics and serving really well. I was just trying to hang in there and fight and give every drop of energy.” Djokovic is seeking to become the first man in the Open Era to win three successive Australian Open titles. He came close to not making it to the second week of the year’s first Grand Slam tournament. They both lost serve to begin the final set, then battled evenly until the 22nd game where Djokovic held three match points before finally winning. “He had a lot of chances to win this match,” Djokovic said of his Swiss opponent. “All the credit to him. I feel sorry that one of us had to lose.”\n\nSCARE\n\nSerena Williams had a painful start to the Australian Open. The American scared herself and fans when she turned her right ankle in her first-round match. Then she hit herself in the head with her racquet. “That’s it, I’m done, I’m done,” the tournament’s third seed joked when asked what other surprises she might have. “That was it. Just wanted to do two things. Now I got it out of the way.” Serena was leading Edina Gallovits-Hall 4-0 when her foot caught and she fell awkwardly to the court, clutching her right ankle. She was helped to her courtside chair and a WTA trainer assessed and re-taped her already heavily taped ankle. She returned to the court and won the next four points to break her opponent’s serve. When she held to close out the first set, she received additional treatment for the ankle. Then, in her second-round match against Garbine Muguruza, Williams hit herself in the face with her racquet, drawing blood. “I think it happens to everyone, but I have never busted it wide open like that,” Serena said. “So, yeah, I was like, ‘Oh, no. I can’t have a tooth fall out.’ That would be horrible.” Instead, it was her opponents she was putting out of the tournament. She beat Gallovits-Hall 6-0 6-0 and Muguruza 6-2 6-0.\n\nSTILL NOT THERE\n\nDavid Ferrer will move up to number four in the world when the new rankings are published after the Australian Open. But just because he’s now passed the injured Rafael Nadal, Ferrer doesn’t believe he’s that close to the Big Four of men’s tennis – Novak Djokovic, Roger Federer, Andy Murray and Nadal. The four have won 33 of the last 34 Grand Slam tournament titles, with only Juan Martin del Potro grabbing the US Open crown in 2009. Although he has been ranked fifth in the world at the end of the last two years, Ferrer has never reached a Grand Slam tournament final, being a three-time semifinalists in the four majors, including twice last year. “Is very difficult to win a Grand slam because there are the top four,” said the Spaniard. “In this moment, the last three or four years, they are better than the other players. … You have to play your best or more than best to beat these guys. Hopefully I can beat them in the Grand Slams sometime.”\n\nSTUNNED\n\nEverything seemed to be going right for Samantha Stosur. Then things changed dramatically – and quickly. Stosur was two points from winning her second-round match when China’s Zheng Jie won five straight games to stun the Australian. The final point came on Stosur’s ninth double-fault of the match. “Obviously it’s a hard one to take when you get yourself into a winning position and you lose five games straight,” Stosur said. “It just kept happening, point after point after point.” In 13 appearances at the Australian Open Stosur has never made it past the fourth round. She became the first Australian woman to win a Grand Slam singles title in more than 30 years when she captured the US Open in 2011, a year after she reached the French Open final. “At 5-2 I felt great,” she said. “Then all of a sudden it obviously went away quite quickly. Crazy things start popping into your head. You make an error and you tighten up a little bit.” In her on-court interview, Zheng apologized to the crowd, which was heavily rooting for Stosur. “It’s amazing I could come back,” she said.\n\nSAD NEWS\n\nBrad Drewett is stepping down as head of the ATP after being diagnosed with Motor Neurone Disease, which is also known as Lou Gehrig’s Disease. The 54-year-old Australian was appointed ATP Executive Chairman and president just 12 months ago. He will continue in his role until a successor is found. As a player, Drewett reached a career-high singles ranking of 34th in the world in 1984 and was ranked in the top 20 in doubles. He has been a part of the ATP for more than 35 years, as a player, ATP Player Council member, ATP Player Board member, as CEO of the International Region and tournament director of the year-ending event before being named to the top spot. Roger Federer, president of the ATP Player Council, said in a statement that it was “sad news for all of us at the ATP and the entire tennis community. He is well liked and respected by everyone and has done a tremendous job in leading the ATP over the past 12 months, overseeing some major initiatives and a record-breaking year in 2012.”\n\nSOON TO RETURN\n\nRafael Nadal is expected to return to tennis at the Brazil Open next month. The Spaniard has not played since Wimbledon, mainly because of tendinitis in his left knee. A stomach virus forced him to withdraw from an exhibition event last month in Abu Dhabi and also skip the Australian Open. Nadal is also entered in the Mexican Open in Acapulco, which begins on Feb. 25. He won both tournaments the only other time he entered them, which was in 2005.\n\nSURVIVED\n\nIt wasn’t easy, but Frenchman Gael Monfils finally got past Taiwan’s Lu Yen-Hsun in a second-round match. Monfils double-faulted on four successive match points before finally clinching the five-set victory. “It was a bit crazy,” Monfils admitted in a courtside interview. “It was like, “I need to hit an ace because I know it’s going to be a double-fault for sure. It was weird. I think I got a big lucky in the end.” Ranked as high as seventh in the world in 2011, Monfils missed a lot of last year with a right knee injury and has fallen to 86th in the rankings.\n\nSIGNED\n\nTwo-time defending champion John Isner and rising star Ryan Harrison have agreed to play in this year’s Hall of Fame Tennis Championships. Their commitments to the tournament were announced at the same time the International Tennis Hall of Fame in Newport, Rhode Island, USA, revealed that a consortium of global companies have signed multi-year deals to sponsor the only grass-court tournament in the Americas. The 2013 tournament, which will be held July 8-14, will be sponsored by Rolex, Chubb Personal Insurance, EMC Corporation, Alex and Ani, and Corona.\n\nSWEETER WITH AGE\n\nKimiko Date-Krumm players for just one reason: she loves the game. But she’ll also take the wins and the records that come along with her on-court successes. The 42-year-old became the oldest woman to win a Australian Open singles match in the Open Era when she upset 12th-seeded Nadia Petrova in the opening round 6-2 6-0. “Of course I’m very happy to win today, but I don’t play for the record,” said Date-Krumm, who retired and was out of tennis for 11 years before she returned to the WTA tour in 2008. “I don’t have a target or a dream. I already had big success in my first career, so I’m just enjoying the traveling and talking to the young players. It is fun.” It was her first Australian Open win since 1996, the year she retired. And she had more fun in the second round, downing Israel’s Shahar Peer, who is 12 years her junior, 6-2 7-5. The run ended in the third round when she lost to Bojana Jovanovski 6-2 7-6 (3). “Some people, the player’s mother is younger than me – so it’s like my daughter,” Date-Krumm laughed. “Everyone is almost half age as me, so it’s not easy, but I’ve got nothing to lose so I just try to keep going.” She said she retired at the age of 26 because of the pressure of winning. She had been ranked as high as fourth in the world. “(There was) always too much attention to me. And I was young, so I don’t have not so many space for myself,” she said. “It’s very tough that time, so I don’t like so much tennis, and tour also. … (There was a time when) I don’t like so much tennis. But now I like tennis. I like practice. I like game. I like tour.”\n\nSTRONG PERFORMANCE\n\nGreat Britain’s Laura Robson is making her mark in Grand Slam tournaments. She knocked off eighth-seeded Petra Kvitova at the Australian Open, taking the third set 11-9. At last year’s US Open, the 18-year-old beat both Kim Clijsters and Li Na. “I knew it was going to be very, very tough and trying to return her serve in the first set was very, very hard,” Robson said after her win over Kvitova. “But I knew once I got my returns firing and a bit more confidence on my serve I could get myself back into the match and that’s what I did.” The winner was helped by Kvitova, a former Wimbledon champion, who committed 18 double faults.\n\nSNAPPED\n\nJerzy Janowicz admits he went a little “nuts” when the chair umpire didn’t agree with him. With Janowicz leading 9-8 in a tiebreak, India’s Somdev Devvarman hit a forehand down the line. Janowicz thought the ball was out. The chair umpire, Marija Cicak, ruled otherwise. Evidently believing Cicak had wronged him previously, Janowicz began screaming, “How many times? How many times?” before he dropped to his knees on the court, screaming to the umpire, “I’m begging you.” Devvarman said he was worried about his opponent’s voice. “I mean, the guy was yelling at the top of his lungs and I was like, ‘Dude, just calm down.’” After losing the tiebreak 12-10, Janowicz hit the umpire’s chair and tossed a water bottle across the court, earning him a code violation. Seeded 24th, Janowicz won the four-hour match, 6-7 (10) 3-6 6-1 6-0 7-5. “You can’t control your emotions all the time,” he said after the match. “Actually, I went nuts. I calmed down little bit later on. Sometimes I have problem to control by emotions, but I’m trying to work on this.”\n\nSHARED PERFORMANCES\n\nSisters Venus and Serena Williams are arguably the best women’s doubles team in the world. It’s just that they don’t play often. Consequently the sisters were seeded 12th at this year’s Australian Open, even though they have won 13 major doubles titles in their careers, including four at the Australian open and three Olympic gold medals in doubles. They have reached the final in seven of the last 10 Grand Slam tournaments that they’ve played and have never lost a doubles match once they get to the final. “They mean a lot to me,” Serena said about doubles titles. “I mean, people that are winning a lot of singles titles nowadays in the past decade or two decades usually don’t win as many in doubles. So I’m almost even with my singles and doubles.” Serena has 15 Grand Slam singles titles, while Venus has seven. Venus has joked that they have so many trophies they use some as fruit bowls.\n\nSTEPPING UP\n\nTennis is stepping up to help one of its own. Tennis greats are helping to raise money for retired player Andrew Florent, who was recently diagnosed with cancer. Fans can bid on a private tennis lesson by Jim Courier or play a doubles match against Pat Rafter and Goran Ivanisevic. Then there are two seats at the so-called Legends Lunch on the day of the women’s final, where the attendees will include Rod Laver and Andre Agassi. Among other items to be auctioned are a pair of tickets to both the men’s sand women’s finals, as well as a photo opportunity with the men’s winner. Now 42 years old, Florent was runner-up at the Australian Open juniors boys singles in 1988. He turned pro in 1990 and became a doubles specialist, reaching a career high ranking of 13th in 2001.\n\nSURFING\n\nAustralian Open: www.australianopen.com\n\nHeilbronn: www.heilbronn-open.de/\n\nParis: www.opengdfsuez.com/\n\nPattaya: www.pentanglepromotions.com\n\nDavis Cup: www.daviscup.com\n\nITF: www.itftennis.com\n\nATP World Tour: www.atpworldtour.com/\n\nWTA: www.wtatennis.com/\n\nTOURNAMENTS THIS WEEK\n\nMEN\n\nAustralian Open, Melbourne, Australia, hard (second week)\n\n$113,662 Heilbronn Open, Heilbronn, Germany, hard\n\nWOMEN\n\nAustralian Open, Melbourne, Australia, hard (second week)\n\nTOURNAMENTS NEXT WEEK\n\nWOMEN\n\n$690,000 Open GDF Suez, Paris, France, hard\n\n$235,000 PTT Pattaya Open, Pattaya, Thailand, hard\n\nDAVIS CUP\n\nFirst Round\n\nWorld Group\n\nCanada vs. Spain at Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada, hard\n\nItaly vs. Croatia at Turin, Italy, clay\n\nBelgium vs. Serbia at Charleroi, Belgium, clay\n\nUnited States vs. Brazil at Jacksonville, Florida, USA, hard\n\nFrance vs. Israel at Rouen, France, hard\n\nArgentina vs. Germany at Buenos Aires, Argentina, clay\n\nKazakhstan vs. Austria at Astana, Kazakhstan, clay\n\nSwitzerland vs. Austria at Geneva, Switzerland, hard\n\nGroup I\n\nAmericas Zone: Uruguay vs. Dominican Republic at Montevideo, Uruguay, clay\n\nAsia/Oceania Zone: Chinese Taipei vs. Australia at Kaohsiung, Taiwan; Uzbekistan vs. China at Namangan, Uzbekistan, clay; India vs. South Korea at New Delhi, India, hard; Japan vs. Indonesia at Tokyo, Japan, hard\n\nEurope/Africa Zone: Poland vs. Slovenia at Wroclaw, Poland, hard; Romania vs. Denmark at Cluj Napoca, Romania, hard; Ukraine vs. Slovak Republic at Kremenchug, Ukraine, hard\n\nGroup II\n\nAmericas Zone: Puerto Rico vs. Mexico at Humacao, Puerto Rico, hard; El Salvador vs. Barbados at Santa Tecla, El Salvador, clay; Venezuela vs. Guatemala at Caracas, Venezuela, hard; Peru vs. Haiti at Lima, Peru, clay\n\nAsia/Oceania Zone: New Zealand vs. Lebanon at Auckland, New Zealand, hard; Sri Lanka vs. Pakistan at Colombo, Sri Lanka, clay; Kuwait vs. Thailand at Meshref, Kuwait, hard; Philippines vs. Syria at Lapu-Lapu, Philippines, clay\n\nEurope/Africa Zone: Bulgaria vs. Finland at Sofia, Bulgaria, hard; Ireland vs. Estonia at Dublin, Ireland, hard; Tunisia vs. Latvia at El Menzah, Tunisia, hard; Monaco vs. Belarus at Roquebrune-Cap-Martin, Monaco, clay; Moldova vs. Hungary at Chisinau, Moldova, hard; Bosnia/Herzegovina vs. Luxembourg at Sarajevo, Bosnia/Herzegovina, hard; Lithuania vs. Cyprus at Siauliai, Lithuania, hard; Portugal vs. Benin at Lisbon, Portugal, clay\n\nBy Justin Cohen\n\nATP Executive Chairman and President Brad Drewett to step down\n\nATP Executive Chairman and President Brad Drewett will step down from his current position after being diagnosed with Lou Gehrig’s disease. Drewett took over his current position in January 2012, having previously been a player on the ATP World Tour, as well as the CEO of the international region and tournament director of the ATP World Tour Finals. Drewett, 54, will continue the job on an ‘interim basis’ until the ATP board of directors appoint his successor. “It has been a privilege to serve as executive chairman and president of the ATP, an organization that I’ve been a part of for more than 35 years since I became a professional tennis player,” said Drewett. “I hold the ATP very close to my heart, and it’s with sadness that I make the decision to enter this transition period due to my ill-health.” Lou Gehrig’s disease, or Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS), affects voluntary muscle activity, including speaking, walking, breathing, swallowing and general movement of the body. It usually causes progressive disability.\n\nAustralian Open attendance already soaring through day two of action\n\nThe first Grand Slam of the year at the Australian Open in Melbourne has already produced many exciting matches and the fans are turning up in herds to see them. The first day combined attendance was 61,955; while Tuesday’s day and night combined attendance was 68,055.\n\nAzarenka teams up with Red Bull for multi-year endorsement deal\n\nAccording to a report by Kristi Dosh of ESPN, world No. 1 Victoria Azarenka has signed a multi-year endorsement deal with beverage giant Red Bull. Azarenka’s management team, Lagardère Unlimited confirmed the report. Financial terms of the agreement were not disclosed.

New Balance announced that they are working with Raonic to launch a new tennis themed collection of footwear and apparel just in time for the 2013 US Open.\n\nKia Motors extends major sponsorship deal with Australian Open as Rolex strikes ATP partnership\n\nAccording to an article written by Matt Cutler for SportsBusiness.com, Kia Motors has penned a five-year extension to its major sponsorship of the Australian Open while the Association of Tennis Professionals (ATP) has announced a new multi-year commercial partnership with Rolex. Korean automotive company Kia will remain as the Open’s top commercial partner through to 2018. Along with supplying vehicles to the event, the company will once again support the popular Kia Open Drive initiative, in which players are transported to certain places – their hotel, a training session or special event – in a Kia vehicle set up with cameras, microphones and an iPad. The iPad generates questions for the player to answer regarding their hobbies, thoughts and stories from the tour. “This will make Kia, with 17 years of support for the Australian Open, the longest-running major sponsor in the 108-year history of this iconic Grand Slam event,” said Kia Motors Australia CEO Charlie Kim. “We believe the excitement and enthusiasm and passion displayed on the court (by players) here in Melbourne… is the perfect embodiment of what the Kia brand stands for.” Rolex will become the official timekeeper of the ATP World Tour, while the agreement also sees the luxury Swiss watch brand extend its existing sponsorship of the season-ending ATP World Tour Finals at The O2 in London. Rolex has a long-standing relationship with tennis, sponsoring the sport’s leading tournaments, and counts 17-time grand slam champion Roger Federer among its family of testimonies.\n\nBoise bids for Davis Cup quarterfinal\n\nAccording to the Idaho Statesman, legendary Boise State University tennis coach Greg Patton is working with Idaho Tennis Association Executive Director Steve Bickham and local businesses to bid to the United States Tennis Association to host the U.S. Davis Cup quarterfinal from April 5-7 at the Taco Bell Arena. The group submitted the bid January 6, and Patton expects the USTA to make its decision within the next 10 days. Tacoma is among the cities in the running, Bickham said. Jim Courier’s U.S. squad opens up Davis Cup play this year against Brazil in Jacksonville from February 1-3. If the United States wins, they will face either Serbia or Belgium.\n\nWTA players Konta, Gajdosova named first brand ambassadors of EleVen by Venus Williams\n\nActive lifestyle apparel brand EleVen By Venus Williams announced that world No. 153 Johanna Konta and No. 167 Jarmila Gajdosova will be the first official brand ambassadors to wear the line in a major tournament.

The Spring 2013 collection of EleVen By Venus Williams launches January 16, 2013 and will be added to the current collection available at local retailers, tennis shops, and online at EleVenByVenus.com.\n\nWTA Tour adding new events in 2013 while increasing prize money\n\nThe WTA Tour recently announced new tournaments in Brazil and Poland in 2013, while the season prize money will see a 10 percent increase overall to $58.7 million. This year, the overall prize money on the WTA Tour excluding Grand Slams will increase from $53.3 million in 2012 to $58.7 million. It is a 69 percent rise since the organization’s Road Map charter was put in place in 2009. The new events on the WTA Tour in 2013 will be in Katowice, Poland in April and in the Brazilian city of Florianopolis. In addition to the event in Bogota, Colombia, and Florianopolis, an International event will be relocated from Memphis in the United States to Rio de Janeiro. The 2014 calendar will also feature events relocating to China and Hong Kong. Wuhan, the hometown of current World No. 6 and 2011 French Open champion Li Na, will host a Premier 5 event the week prior to the China Open in Beijing. The tournament will feature at least seven of the year-end top 10-ranked players competing for more than $2 million in prize money and will replace the Toray Pan Pacific Open in Tokyo. Coupled with the relocation of an International event from Kuala Lumpur to Hong Kong in 2014, China will host five of the 18 events in the Asia-Pacific region. “We are excited by the growth of women’s professional tennis, particularly in key markets like China and Brazil,” said Stacey Allaster, WTA chairman and CEO. “Development in the BRIC markets, led by China, has been a strategic priority for the past several years. We look forward to continue strengthening of our global brand, developing our sport, and building our fan base worldwide.”\n\nPark advocates disagree with USTA expansion plan\n\nAccording to an article written by Clare Trapasso of the New York Daily News, Park advocates aren’t showing much love to a plan for a $500 million expansion of a premiere tennis center in Flushing Meadows-Corona Park, which plays host each summer to the US Open. Activists slammed a proposal last week that would allow the U.S. Tennis Association to use .68 acres of park land for the project and not replace it elsewhere. “Any time that we’re going to be taking away park land, park land replacement must be a priority,” said City Councilwoman Julissa Ferreras (D-East Elmhurst). “Green space is so limited in our community.” But USTA officials said the city Parks Department asked the association to pay for improvements in the park instead of replacing the small sliver of property. The city will choose the projects. The USTA submitted a proposal to the city last Monday to expand the Billie Jean King National Tennis Center, where the U.S. Open is held annually. It must undergo a city and public review process before the City Council can vote on whether to approve it.\n\nWilson launches new clay court tennis balls\n\nContinuing its leadership in the tennis ball category, Wilson Tennis (www.wilsontennis.com) expands its premium tennis ball position with new Tour Clay Red and Tour Clay Green tennis balls that feature Element Guard technology, developed to maximize performance and durability specific to red and green clay court surfaces. Wilson is already positioned as the leader in premium hard court tennis balls used at more than 45 professional events around the world, as well as the Official Ball at the US Open and the upcoming Australian Open Grand Slam. The ITF also utilizes Wilson as the Official Ball of Davis Cup and Fed Cup, along with the WTA recognizing Wilson as its Official Tennis Ball. In the US market, Wilson is also the Official Ball of the NCAA and is utilized at all USTA circuit events. “We are very proud of our ongoing focus to produce the most consistent quality tennis ball utilized on hard courts around the world and are now excited that we will stand behind this same focus for premium performance on clay courts globally,” said Jon Muir, general manager of Wilson Racquet Sports. “It may be taken for granted by many consumers, but Wilson continues to ensure all levels of players who want the most consistent and best performing tennis ball can play Wilson with confidence on all court surfaces.” Launching this month, the Wilson Tour Clay Red and Tour Clay Green balls provide a surface-specific performance for red and green court characteristics in different countries. The Tour Clay Red is constructed specifically for use on red clay courts and is ideal for courts in Europe and South America.

Organizers of the US Open said they were moving the final to Monday to allow the two finalists a day off after their semifinal victories. Quoted in a USA Today article written by Douglas Robson, ATP board representative Justin Gimelstob said he and other ATP leaders were “frustrated” by the USTA’s announcement to extend the tournament to 15 days. Gimelstob also said, “It’s a tale of two very different interpretations. There are nine months to go, and many more chapters to be written.” USTA Spokesman Chris Widmaier said Tuesday that the decision to move the final to Monday should have surprised no one based on communication with the tour and players in recent months. “We understand their concerns,” Widmaier said. “We look forward to further discussions.” While many players were frustrated with the change, ATP executives and board members were stunned Andy Murray praised the changes. “I’m pleased that the USTA has modified the U.S. Open schedule to include a day of rest between the semifinals and final,” 2012 champion Murray said in the statement. “Together with the prize money increase, it’s good that they’ve taken on board the players’ concerns.”The ATP runs the men’s World Tour but not the four Grand Slams, and the organization said in a statement: “We strongly believe the US Open should keep a similar schedule to the other Grand Slams, with the men’s semi-finals completed by Friday and the final on Sunday. The ATP and its players have made it clear to the US Open that we do not support a Monday final (at Flushing Meadows). It is unfortunate the US Open response did not reflect our views on this issue and the ATP and its players will continue to pursue this matter in its discussions with the USTA.” The USTA has said the change is for the 2013 event only and that the matter would be reviewed after that.\n\nATP approves tournament in Bogotá in 2013\n\nThe ATP World Tour is set to return to Bogotá, Colombia, in 2013, following the ATP Board of Directors’ approval of the sale of the Los Angeles tournament, an ATP World Tour 250 event, to IMLA de Colombia, a Colombian entertainment and sports marketing company. The new tournament will be staged at the Centro de Alto Rendimiento in Bogotá, the same venue that hosted an ATP World Tour event from 1997–2002. Brad Drewett, ATP Executive Chairman & President, said, “The ATP World Tour is a truly global sports property, and demand for events around the world has never been greater. This latest transfer represents a fantastic opportunity for the ATP World Tour to continue to strengthen its presence in South America, a growing market for men’s professional tennis. The new tournament owners have a wealth of experience in tennis and we look forward to a successful event in Colombia. “I would also like to take this opportunity to thank Bob Kramer and his organizing team for their tireless work in running the ATP World Tour 250 event in Los Angeles over the years. Bob’s services to tennis have been hugely appreciated,” said Drewett. The Bogota event will take place on outdoor hard-court from July 15-21, 2013. In turn, the 2013 BB&T Atlanta Open will take place one week later, from July 22-28.\n\nMP & Silva adds ATP Kremlin Cup to its Tennis Portfolio\n\nMP & Silva, a leading international media rights company, has secured a worldwide rights distribution deal from 2014 to 2018 with the Kremlin Cup ATP World Tour 250 Series event. The deal includes all territories outside Russia. Held in the Olympic Stadium in Moscow once a year, the Kremlin Cup is Russia’s first professional international tennis tournament, played in indoors hard courts.

The Kremlin Cup is a welcome addition to the portfolio, being the first time that MP & Silva adds its footprint in Russia. MP & Silva will be the exclusive distributor of Kremlin Cup across cable, satellite, terrestrial, Web TV, IPTV and mobile platforms.\n\nATP Executive Chairman and President makes Sports Business Journal’s Top 50 list\n\nATP Executive Chairman and President Brad Drewett has been named on Sports Business Journal’s list of 50 Most Influential People in Sports Business. It is the first time that an ATP executive has featured on the list and the Australian is the only tennis executive to make this year’s list. Recognizing Drewett for his work in securing a greater share of Grand Slam tournament revenue for players, the SBJ wrote that “Drewett took over the ATP in 2012… (and) already has won huge concessions from the Australian Open.”\n\nMadison Keys, Rhyne Williams Win Australian Open Wild Card Playoffs\n\nMadison Keys (Rock Island, Ill.) and Rhyne Williams (Knoxville, Tenn.) each earned wild card entries into the main draw of the 2013 Australian Open Sunday by winning the Australian Open Wild Card Playoffs at Life Time Athletic & Tennis at Peachtree Corners. Keys defeated Mallory Burdette (Jackson, Ga.), 7-5, 6-3, and Williams took down Tim Smyczek (Milwaukee), 7-6(4), 5-7, 6-3, 6-3, in Sunday’s indoor finals, each in a match format emulating the Grand Slam. The 17-year old Keys, seeded third, won the event for the second year in a row, becoming the first woman and second player overall, along with Ryan Harrison (2009-10), to do so in the tournament’s five-year history. “I’m pretty happy with how I’ve been doing and how I’ve been playing. Hopefully I can just really keep it up now,” said Keys, who fell to Jie Zheng in the first round of last January’s Australian Open, 6-2, 6-1. “It’d be great to go to Australia and not get killed in the first round this year. Hopefully that happens. But I’m just really excited to go down and start playing some tournaments again.” “I’m moving incredibly well, and when I’m moving my best I feel like I give myself a really good chance of winning, and I feel like I could play with anyone,” said the 190th-ranked Williams, who will play in his second straight Grand Slam after qualifying and reaching the first round of the US Open this summer.\n\nMark Knowles Celebrity Tennis Invitational raises $100,000\n\nThe Mark Knowles Celebrity Tennis Invitational in the Bahamas at the Atlantis, Paradise Island, raised $100,000 this year, bringing total contributions over the 12 years of existence to around $900,000. The main beneficiaries include the Sassoon Heart Foundation (Pediatric), the Cancer Society For Pediatric Care, the Association for the Physically Disabled, the Special Olympics, Mark Knowles Tennis scholarships for promising junior tennis players and numerous additional children’s charities. The recently-retired 41-year-old Knowles welcomed many professional tennis players to his annual event including Sam Querrey, Lindsay Davenport, Sabine Lisicki and Xavier Malisse.\n\nBrisbane International named Best Sports Event in Queensland\n\nThe Brisbane International was named the best sports event in Queensland for 2012 at the 18th Annual Queensland Sport Awards at the Brisbane Convention and Exhibition Centre last week. “It’s a great honor for the Brisbane International to receive this award,” said Cameron Pearson, Tournament Director of the Brisbane International. “This is the second time we’ve been named the Queensland Sport Event of the Year, the first was in 2009 the inaugural year of the Brisbane International. 2012 was an exciting year for the Brisbane International. More of the world’s top female tennis players signed on to compete in the sunshine state after the tournament was upgraded by the Women’s Tennis Association (WTA) to a Premier event, allowing unlimited participation by the world’s top 10 tennis players and a significant prize money boost to $655,000, which will increase again in 2013 to $1,000,000.\n\nNishikori, Haas commit to 2013 Delray Beach International Tennis Championships\n\nFormer champions Kei Nishikori and Tommy Haas have agreed to participate in the 2013 Delray Beach International Tennis Championships (ITC) in South Florida, which will be played from February 22-March 3, 2013. Nishikori, the 2008 champion, and Haas, the 2006 champion, will join Mardy Fish and the world’s top ranked doubles duo of Bob and Mike Bryan as early commitments to the tournament.\n\nKohlschreiber, Becker, Kamke commit to Power Horse Cup in Dusseldorf\n\nGermans Philipp Kohlschreiber, Benjamin Becker and Tobias Kamke have signed on to participate in the Power Horse Cup in Dusseldorf, which will be played from May 19-25, 2013. “With Kohlschreiber, Becker and Kamke in the line-up, it means three German top tennis players will be competing at the Rochusclub. It’s great news and we’re very happy,” said Tournament Director Dietloff von Arnim. In November, World No. 9 Janko Tipsarevic announced his commitment to the 2013 event.\n\nAustralian Matthew Ebden hires Peter McNamara as Coach\n\nAustralian No. 4 Matthew Ebden has announced his new coaching partnership with former World No. 7 Peter McNamara. After reaching a career-high ranking of No. 61 in October, the newly married Ebden finished the year just outside the Top 100. “He has a chance because he doesn’t really have a weakness and that’s a nice situation to be in, as it means he can build on what he’s got,” said McNamara. “We’ll take a more professional attitude towards building to the Top 30 in the world and I think that’s where he can make. There’s no difference between anyone outside the Top 6 and the next 100: they’re all very similar. Matt’s one of the guys who can make a jump if he puts his head down and pushes his limits.” McNamara, who won two Wimbledon doubles titles and the 1979 Australian Open with countryman Paul McNamee, has previously coached Mark Philippoussis and most recently worked with Grigor Dimitrov.\n\nWilson Ramps Up Footwear Technology for 2013 with Rush Pro\n\nReinforcing its commitment to providing best-in-class performance, Wilson Racquet Sports is completely revamping its footwear line for 2013 with the introduction of the Rush Pro™ shoe for men, women and juniors.

We are the only tennis brand providing fully integrated premium products for players head to toe.”\n\nSTARS\n\nKristina Mladenovic beat Valeria Savinykh 7-5 5-7 6-1 to win the Ankara Cup in Ankara, Turkey\n\nSAYING\n\n“I am honored to have this opportunity to lead the ATP, an organization that I am proud to have been a part of since the beginning of my professional playing career. The ATP World Tour and men’s tennis are stronger than ever and it is my intention to continue to lead the organization on this successful path, working hand in hand with our players and tournaments. I am very excited about the opportunities ahead.” – Brad Drewett, after being named executive chairman and president of the ATP.\n\n“Brad is a very experienced executive and has been an effective leader within the ATP for many years. He understands the global nature of the business as well as the complexities of dealing with all of the Tour’s stakeholders. I am confident that Brad’s work ethic and leadership will help contribute to the continued success of the ATP World Tour.” – Roger Federer, president of the ATP Player Council.\n\n“I am thrilled to be back on the ATP Champions Tour after more than a decade and being able to compete in Zurich against some great champions is an exciting prospect. I’m feeling good and ready to compete again and am looking forward to being back on the ATP Champions Tour.” – Jimmy Connors, who will return to the senior tour at the age of 59.\n\n“After seven years partnering with the WTA, we have decided not to renew the partnership. We feel that after seven years our brand has evolved and our business as well.” – Graciela Pineda, Sony Ericsson spokeswoman.\n\n“They have been a great partner and we will miss them.” – The WTA Tour, in a statement, concerning the Sony Ericsson decision.\n\nSTEPPING UP\n\nA former player is the new executive chairman and president of the ATP. Brad Drewett will take over the reigns of the men’s tennis organization on January 1. He will be based in the ATP’s London office. The ATP Board of Directors voted unanimously to give the 53-year-old Australian a three-year contract. Drewett won the Australian Open junior boys in both 1975 and 1977 before playing on the tour for 12 years, reaching as high as 34th in the world in singles. He currently serves as CEO of the ATP International Group, where he has overseen operations in the Middle East, Asia and Pacific regions since 1999. Prior to that, Drewett was elected to the Player Council and was an ATP Player Board Representative from 1993 until 1999. He also has served as tournament director of the Barclays ATP World Tour Finals and formerly the Tennis Masters Cup since 2001. Drewett succeeds Adam S. Helfant, who had headed the men’s tennis organization since 2009.\n\nSPONSORSHIP ENDS\n\nSony Ericsson Mobile Communications AB will end its sponsorship of the women’s tour when the agreement ends next year. When Sony Ericsson signed a six-year, USD $88 million contract in 2005, it was the largest sponsorship in tennis history and in women’s professional sports. The company dropped the naming rights last year when it signed a two-year extension until December 31, 2012. In a statement emailed to Bloomberg News, the WTA said the Sony Ericsson sponsorship “has over the past seven years taken women’s tennis to new heights of popularity and success, and broadened the audience for the sport across the globe.”\n\nOver the past 18 months, the WTA has signed several major new sponsors in Europe and Asia-Pacific, including BNP Paribas and its Turkish partner TEB as co-sponsors of the WTA’s year-end Championships.\n\nSAY IT LOUD\n\nThe WTA has announced a four-year deal with PERFORM, a digital sports specialist that will manage the WTA’s Premier tournament media rights from 2013 through 2016. The deal covers the 22 Premier WTA events, including the season-ending finale. Under the agreement, PERFORM has acquired all media rights to the Premier tournaments and will oversee the overall development and media of the events outside the United States and Canada. The digital sports media company already provides the WTA with a range of web, live streaming and mobile services. It plans to double the current live match production levels and improve the availability of ancillary content packages across all media with a weekly magazine program, e-Player coverage and hourly news output in at least seven languages.\n\nSENIOR SENIOR\n\nJimmy Connors is back. Ending a 13-year absence, Connors will return to the ATP Champions Tour when he competes in the BNP Paribas Zurich Open in March. The 59-year-old left-hander will join a round-robin group that includes Henri Leconte. Others entered in the eight-player, March 20-24 tournament include defending champion Mark Philippoussis, Tim Henman and Marat Safin. The event also will feature the world’s top juniors, who will play their own round-robin tournament. The youngsters and the legends will join to play doubles.\n\nSTAYING HOME\n\nStill recovering from the immune system disease Sjogren’s syndrome, Venus Williams has withdrawn from January’s ASB Classic in Auckland, New Zealand. The 31-year-old Williams has not played a WTA match since pulling out of the US Open with the illness. She has played several exhibition matches recently, but organizers of the New Zealand tournament said the American is not yet ready to return to competitive tennis. Williams, who has won seven Grand Slam singles titles, played in only four tournaments in 2011 because of injuries.\n\nVenus Williams is still expected to play the Australian Open later in January. Craig Tiley, tournament director of the year’s first Grand Slam tournament, told newspapers that he had been in contact with Williams’ agent. “I wanted to touch base, but there’s no change for her. She’s coming,” Tiley was quoted as saying.\n\nSHARAPOVA OUT\n\nNot fully recovered from an injury to her left ankle, Maria Sharapova has withdrawn from the Brisbane International. Sharapova was hurt in September during the Pan Pacific Championships in Tokyo, Japan. In a statement sent to tournament officials, Sharapova said the injury should not affect her playing the Australian Open, which she won in 2008. The injury forced her to withdraw from the China Open and she was hobbled while losing two matches at the year-ending WTA Championships.\n\nSINGLED OUT\n\nNovak Djokovic, who won three of the four Grand Slam tournaments in 2011, has been named BBC Overseas Sports Personality of the Year. The 24-year-old Serb won his first 41 matches of the year and replaced Spain’s Rafael Nadal as the ATP’s number one player in the world. Djokovic’s 10 titles in 2011 included the Australian Open, Wimbledon and the US Open. He beat out Barcelona and Argentina soccer star Lionel Messi and German Formula 1 race car world champion Sebastian Vettel for the award. It is the sixth time in 11 years that a tennis player has won the award, which is decided by a panel of sports editors from national and regional newspapers and magazines. Other tennis players to receive the award include Rafael Nadal, Roger Federer and Goran Ivanisevic.\n\nSHE’S THE TOPS\n\nWimbledon champion Petra Kvitova has been named Czech athlete of the year in a poll of sports journalists. The 21-year-old Kvitova won five other singles titles in 2011, including the season-ending WTA Tour Championships. Rising from 34th in the world to number two, Kvitova was named the WTA’s Player of the Year.\n\nSLUSH FUND\n\nThe singles winners at next year’s BNP Paribas Open in Indian Wells, California, USA, will each pocket USD $1 million. The tournament becomes the first combined ATP World Tour and WTA event to award the two singles champions a million dollars each. Prize money has been increased for all rounds of the tournament, with the singles runner-up earning USD $500,000 and the two losing semifinalists receiving USD $250,000. “The BNP Paribas Open has been raising the bar for the sport over the course of the past four decades, and today’s $1 million winners’ prize money announcement represents yet another historic milestone,” said Stacey Allaster, chairman and CEO of the WTA. “The BNP Paribas Open is one of the cornerstone events in professional tennis exactly because of this attention to players and willingness to innovate and push the boundaries of success.” The 2012 tournament will be played in March.\n\nSTRAIGHT IN\n\nJeremy Chardy and Aravane Rezai have been given wild cards into the Australian Open under a reciprocal agreement between the French Tennis Federation and Tennis Australia. The French federation selected Rezai, who has been ranked as high as 15th in the world, and Chardy, who reached a career-high ranking of 31 in 2009. The Australian Open begins Jan. 16 at Melbourne Park.\n\nSIMPLY MARVELOUS\n\nThe women’s singles trophy at the Brisbane International has been named for former Australian star Evonne Goolagong Cawley. “I have won a few trophies in my time, but I have never had a major event name their trophy after me,” said Goolagong Cawley, who won seven Grand Slam tournament singles titles. Cameron Pearson, Brisbane International tournament director, said the trophy was named for Goolagong Cawley because she had “contributed so much to the game during her career and continues to do so with her National Development Camp and work with indigenous youth.” The Brisbane International begins January 1 with US Open champion Samantha Stosur and runner-up Serena Williams in the field. Andy Murray heads the men’s singles field.\n\nSUSPENDED\n\nLucas Renard of Sweden has been suspended for six months and fined USD $5,000 after admitting he committed an offense under Article D of the 2011 Uniform Tennis Anti-Corruption Program. Four of the six months period of ineligibility will be suspended if the 19-year-old Renard commits no future violation, that he exhibits continuous good conduct and that he attends anti-corruption education training. Because of the sanction, Renard is not eligible to participate in any tournament or competition organized or authorized by the governing bodies of professional tennis. No other details of the case were made public.\n\nSEND MONEY BACK\n\nThe United States Tennis Association (USTA) wants Alex Bogomolov Jr. to pay back some of the money it spent on him. Ranked 34th in the world, Bogomolov Jr. will play Davis Cup in 2011 for his native Russia. After his family moved to the United States, the USTA gave Bogomolov Jr. financial and coaching help. The Russians actively recruited the 28-year-old and the International Tennis Federation (ITF) agreed he could play Davis Cup for Russia. “He has received quite a bit of support, it’s an ITF decision and at the USTA we are exploring our options. I’ll leave it at that,” said Patrick McEnroe, who is in charge of player development for the USTA. “I have no issue with Alex personally. From the USTA standpoint, he was born in Russia, he has family there, he should repay the USTA. He’s actually signed something saying that and we’ll see what happens.”\n\nSPORTS CABLE RULING\n\nTennis Channel has won its dispute with Comcast. Tennis Channel filed a complaint against the cable operator last year, accusing it of discriminating against the network in violation of Federal Communications Commission (FCC) rules. Tennis Channel argued that Comcast gave preferential treatment to two similar sports cable networks it owned – Versus and Golf Channel – by placing them on more broadly distributed tiers. In its ruling, the FCC fined Comcast USD $375,000 and ordered it to treat Tennis Channel the same as Versus and Golf Channel.\n\nSEASON GETS UNDERWAY\n\nThe 2012 tennis season gets underway at Perth, Australia, this coming Saturday when China and France battle in the Hyundai Hopman Cup. The format sees two round-robin pools of four being contested before the winners meet in the final. French Open champion Li Na leads China against Marion Bartoli and France. Bartoli’s teammate is Richard Gasquet, who is ranked 19th in the world. Li’s teammate is Wu Di, who is ranked more than 400 places lower than his French counterpart. Others competing in the exhibition include world number one Caroline Wozniacki, Wimbledon champion Petra Kvitova and two-time Grand Slam tournament winner Lleyton Hewitt.\n\nSUCCESSFUL SISTERS\n\nChinese twins Lu Jia-Jing and Lu Jia Xiang continued their winning ways by capturing a USD $25,000 International Tennis Federation (ITF) tournament in Pune, India. In the final, the Lu sisters beat sisters Varatchaya and Varunga Wongteanchai of Thailand 6-1 6-3. It was the third straight tournament title for the Chinese twins. They also won two USD $10,000 ITF events in Pune and Solapur, India.\n\nSELLING SHARES\n\nSpanish star Rafael Nadal and his uncle Miguel Angel Nadal have sold their 10 percent share in Real Mallorca to German businessman Utz Claassen. A Real Madrid fan that lives on the island in the Mediterranean, Nadal had joined a consortium that invested in 2010 in the Real Mallorca soccer team. Claassen purchase now gives him a 20 percent stake in the team.\n\nSHARED PERFORMANCES\n\nAnkara: Nina Bratchikova and Darija Jurak beat Janette Husarova and Katalin Marosi 6-4 6-2\n\nSURFING\n\nTyumen:\n\nwww.tyumentennistour.ru\n\nDoha:\n\nwww.qatartennis.org\n\nChennai:\n\nwww.aircelchennaiopen.org/2012/\n\nBrisbane:\n\nwww.brisbaneinternational.com.au/\n\nAuckland:\n\nwww.asbclassic.co.nz/\n\nPerth:\n\nwww.hopmancup.com.au/\n\nTOURNAMENTS THIS WEEK\n\n(All money in USD)\n\nWOMEN\n\n$50,000 Siberia Cup, Tyumen, Russia, hard\n\nTOURNAMENTS NEXT WEEK\n\nMEN\n\n$1,024,000 Qatar ExxonMobil Open, Doha, Qatar, hard\n\n$422,000 Brisbane International, Brisbane, Australia, hard\n\n$398,250 Aircel Chennai Open, Chennai, India, hard\n\nWOMEN\n\n$655,000 Brisbane International, Brisbane, Australia, hard\n\n$220,000 ASB Classic, Auckland, New Zealand, hard\n\nEXHIBITION\n\nHyundai Hopman Cup, Perth, Australia, hard"
