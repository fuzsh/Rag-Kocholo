        "text": "By Jane Voigt, Special for World Tennis Magazine\n\nWashington D.C. (July 28, 2013) Politicians, lawyers, and journalists make up a large percentage of the working population in Washington D.C.\n\nYet little known to those that peer inside the capital beltway is the celebrity of tennis here.\n\nCiti Open, formerly called The Legg Mason Tennis Classic and now branded with the clout of Citibank, is the creation of Donald Dell a Bethesda, Maryland, native and area lawyer.\n\nAttorney Dell grew out of his law firm a strategic sports marketing and management company — SFX — that partnered with the Washington Tennis & Education Foundation (WT&EF) to establish the annual tournament. Since then Dell’s footprint on the sport has become indelible, inside the beltway and internationally.\n\nDell inched toward the management of tennis players through SFX after his success as captain of the winning 1968 U. S. Davis Cup Team. He used his business connections in and around D. C. plus his friendship with Arthur Ashe — a Richmond, Vir., native and member of that Davis Cup Team — to underwrite the first tournament for professional tennis players one year after the Open Era began in 1968. It was called The Washington Star International, and named after the daily evening newspaper.\n\nHe also played on tour, help create the ATP Tour, ran the ATP Tour, and remains the founder and co-chairman of Citi Open.\n\nThe WT&EF continues its role to “improve the life prospects of low-income, underserved children and youth in the District of Columbia through athletic and academic enrichment,” writes its web site. Its mission satisfied Ashe’s imperative that the tournament be located in an area of D. C. that was inclusive of a broad range of races and ethnicities. Ashe had had his share of discrimination, during his tennis career, and wanted the practice stopped. The game was for everyone.\n\nIn addition to Dell’s continued work at Citi Open, his voice can be heard during the U. S. Open as he calls matches. HIs insight may not be predicated on up-to-the-second Twitter news, yet his vast experience lends an angle to his comments that make listeners pay attention.\n\nAnother lawyer that soared to the top of his profession to become a Supreme Court Justice is John Paul Stevens. Originally from Chicago, the now-retired Justice learned tennis from his older brothers at their parents’ summer home in Michigan.\n\nHis first racquet was a Wilson, or so he recalled in an interview. “It had gut in it,” he added emphatically.\n\nJustice Stevens played on the “B” team at The University of Chicago.\n\n“My coach made it clear that I had the worse serve in captivity,” Stevens said in the same interview. “It’s still true.”\n\nThe best players the Justice ever faced were Bill and Chet Murphy — twins on the first team (the “A” team) of the University of Chicago. “They took care of me,” he said.\n\nHe continued to play during World War II when stationed at Pearl Harbor with the Navy from 1942-1945, after the bombings. Depending on his weekly work schedule, he “played with other officers right on the Navy base.”\n\nBefore his appointment to The Supreme Court in 1973 by President Gerald Ford, Stevens worked as a law clerk. It was 1948. Justice Hugo Black invited him to play on his home’s court in Alexandria.\n\n“I played two sets with him,” Stevens began. “I beat him handily in the first set, but he outlasted me in the second set. He was in better shape than I was when I was a law clerk that spring.”\n\nAlthough Justice Byron White was not a tennis player, Stevens admired the All-American Football and Basketball player whom he met at Pearl Harbor.\n\n“He was one of the greatest athletes in the history of college sports and the best athlete who ever served on the Court.”\n\nWhile on The Supreme Court, he put together a regular Sunday game with two Supreme Court Policemen. He played Justice Antonin Scalia, too, but only twice.\n\n“He’s probably better than me, but I don’t know. He’s an afternoon person and I’m a morning person. Our schedules don’t match up very well.”\n\nJustice Stevens love of the game has endured in retirement. He still plays a couple times a week with a long-time friend and Washington lawyer. In colder months, he arrives sometimes wearing a bright red baseball jacket with ‘Washington Nationals’ embroidered in loopy letters across the front. On the back it reads, ‘Stevens.’ He was given the jacket as a souvenir, after sending a first-pitch right over home plate before a home game.\n\nDavid Gregory, NBC’s host of Meet The Press, lives and plays tennis inside the beltway. What would he improve in his game? “As far as my game, I need better footwork and a better serve-volley game.” He believes now-retired Senator John Breaux is one of the best players inside D. C.\n\nFred Mc Nair’s name isn’t heard frequently in modern tennis circles. A Washington native, Fred, or “Freddie” to his friends, is the fourth Fred Mc Nair. He comes from a tennis playing and tennis giving family. His father started the WT&EF in 1954.\n\nHis grandfather played in the U. S. National Championships, currently the U.S. Open, in 1912. Fred’s father played in the same major four times when it was located at the Westside Tennis Club outside New York City. Fred played there once in 1969.\n\nSTARS\n\nRoger Federer beat Mikhail Youzhny 6-7 (5) 6-3 6-4 to win the Gerry Weber Open in Halle, Germany\n\nAndy Murray beat Marin Cilic 5-7 7-5 6-3 to win The Aegon Championships in London, Great Britain\n\nSimona Halep beat Andrea Petkovic 6-3 6-3 to win the Nürnberger Versicherungscup in Nürnberg, Germany\n\nDaniela Hantuchova beat Donna Vekic 7-6 (5) 6-4 to win The Aegon Classic in Birmingham, Great Britain\n\nSAYING\n\n“I thought I played well from the start and I really had to fight for it, in the semis against Tommy Haas and in the finals against Mikhail Youzhny. I think I did well today and they are exactly the kind of wins I need at this part of the season.” – Roger Federer, after capturing his first title of the year.\n\n“The difference was that he was better today – he’s been better all his life.” – Mikhail Youzhny, who lost to Roger Federer in the final at Halle.\n\n“He’s one of the best grass court players in the world. Me and Marin, we have played against each other since the juniors and we have had a lot of close matches and tight matches. I was lucky to come through in the end because he was playing great tennis, especially towards the end of the second set and I got a little bit lucky at the end of that set.” – Andy Murray, who beat Marin Cilic to win the title at Queen’s Club.\n\n“It was a great match from both sides, a great level of tennis. Andy showed he is capable of coming back; he’s a great fighter. Congratulations to him for a great week. It was an extremely great week for me. I enjoyed all my matches. It wasn’t easy. I had some tough fights.” – Marin Cilic.\n\n“It feels great to finally get the title. The first week on grass is always really demanding on the body, so I’m proud of how I made it through so many long matches throughout the week. And when I really needed to, I was tough mentally. I’ve been playing here since ’99, I think – it was about time I got the title.” – Daniela Hantuchova, after winning at Birmingham, Great Britain.\n\n“I have mixed emotions right now. I can’t be happy after losing a match, but it was a great week for me and I’m happy I could reach the finals. And I gave it my all today – maybe it wasn’t my best tennis, but it was the best I could do today, and Daniela was just the better player out there.” – Donna Vekic, following her loss to Daniela Hantuchova at Birmingham, Great Britain.\n\n“It is something that right now seems light-years away, something that I am not even thinking about.” – Rafael Nadal, when asked about matching Federer’s record 17 Grand Slam tournament titles.\n\n“Ten years ago I went into Wimbledon with so much pressure, even though I had lost in the first round the year before. In terms of needing to prove my point that I was a legitimate Grand Slam contender, I had incredible pressure. Now, 10 years later, I know Wimbledon, I know Halle, I know my way around and what I need to do to perform well. I’m going in with pressure because I’m defending my title. There’s always pressure because it’s a privilege to play at Wimbledon and I want to do so, so well.” – Roger Federer.\n\n“Always having a title you feel happy, especially one week away from Wimbledon. It’s the first tournament on grass this year and to win it gives us confidence.” – Santiago Gonzalez, after teaming with Scott Lipsky to win the Gerry Weber Open doubles.\n\n“I think it is disappointing for a serve-and-volley player to go down like this. It shows also how easy it is to hit passing shots or returns today.” – Roger Federer, after beating Mischa Zverev 6-0 6-0 in the Gerry Weber Open quarterfinals.\n\n“Andrea beat me in Romania a few years ago and I’m happy I could win against her here today. She played great and the atmosphere was great. It’s an unbelievable feeling to win my first WTA title.” – Simona Halep, who beat Andrea Petkovic in the final of the Nürnberger Versicherungscup.\n\n“There are definitely more positives than negatives. The good thing is Simona made it a little easier for me to get over the loss because she played such an incredible match. She played an almost perfect match, especially after she found her rhythm in the middle of the first set. I wasn’t playing my best tennis, but even if I was playing my best tennis, it would be a very, very tough call.” – Andrea Petkovic.\n\n“There is no one leader. If there is a guy playing better than the other, he doesn’t try to be the leader. Because that is not good. You don’t want to feel that your brother is carrying you.” – Mike Bryan, on how he and brother Bob play winning doubles.\n\n“As twins, you see your twin as an equal. You don’t want to feel like you are dominating. When one of us starts to talk and bosses the other around, that is a negative for us. It is better in big moments, when we don’t say too much.” – Bob Bryan.\n\n“I love playing as many weeks on grass as possible. Yeah, that’s why the Olympics and playing Newport (Rhode Island, USA) last year was so special to me because I could play a bigger chunk of tournaments. I think it’s a unique surface. There are certain players that play really well on it.” – Lleyton Hewitt, who is second only to Roger Federer in number of match wins on grass among active players.\n\n“Happy Father’s Day to our awesome Dad back home in California. He is the reason we fell in love with this game so many years ago.” – Bob Bryan.\n\nSTILL WINNING\n\nHalle, Germany, seemed as good a place as any for Roger Federer to return to the winner’s circle. Federer used the grass-court tournament to prepare for his defense of his Wimbledon title by rallying from a set down to beat Russia’s Mikhail Youzhny and capture his first title of 2013. “I have won a lot in my career but not recently,” said Federer, who hadn’t won since August 2012 in Cincinnati, Ohio, USA. “I am happy it worked for me today.” Youzhny played brilliantly and matched Federer with hammering ground strokes. Federer took home the Gerry Weber Open title for the sixth time after playing for two hours, 2 minutes. It was his 77th career title, tying him with John McEnroe for third place in the career titles list behind Jimmy Connors and Ivan Lendl. “I was satisfied with my game in the past 10 months,” Federer said. “Maybe people thought I was playing badly. That was not the case. I was playing well but when it mattered the others were just better. Today it worked well.”\n\nSTRONG AGAIN\n\nAndy Murray overcame an opening-set groin strain and a strong performance by defending champion Marin Cilic to win his third Aegon Championships at Queen’s Club. In gaining his 27th career singles title, Murray rallied to defeat Cilic 5-7 7-6 6-3. It was his first tournament since he withdrew from the French Open with a back injury. “I worked very hard in the time that I had off to try and get myself in the best shape possible,” Murray said. The winner screamed in agony in the eighth game of the match when his foot slipped on the grass and he strained his groin. He continued to play without treatment. “It was just a bit sore on the groin area, but thankfully it wasn’t too bad,” Murray said. Murray also won the Wimbledon warm-up tournament in 2009 and 2011, and became the sixth player to win Queen’s Club three or more times.\n\nSLOVAKIAN CHAMPION\n\nDaniela Hantuchova was the experienced veteran and ranked higher. She was supposed to win, considering her opponent in the final was 16-year-old Donna Vekic. But even in defeat Vekic showed she could be the face of the future on the WTA tour. “This was my second WTA final and I’m still only 16,” said Vekic, the youngest player in the top 350 in the rankings. “Things have gone fast so far in my career, but I’m hoping when I make my third final I will win it. But it’s been a great week, considering it was my first grass-court event on the WTA Tour. Now I’m really looking forward to Wimbledon” where she will be making her main draw debut. The 30-year-old Hantuchova captured her sixth career title, her first since Pattaya City, Thailand, in February. This was her first win in three grass-court finals, having been runner-up in Eastbourne, Great Britain, in 2004, and Birmingham, Great Britain, in 2011.\n\nSIMONA VICTORIOUS\n\nPlaying in the fourth final of her career, Simona Halep finally came away with the big trophy. The Romanian never lost her serve as she bested former top-10 player Andrea Petkovic at the Nürnberger Versicherungscup for her first WTA title. “This is a very nice win for me, and this is a very nice tournament,” Halep said. “I’ll never forget this.” Halep became the eighth Romanian ever to win a WTA title, joining Virginia Ruzici, Irina Spirlea, Ruxandra Drogomir Ilie, Sorana Cirstea, Alexandra Dulgheru, Irina-Camelia Begu and Monica Niculescu. Petkovic entered the tournament as a wild card. Despite the defeat, her confidence is high as she heads to Wimbledon, where she received a wild card into the main draw. “Everybody knows that grass and me haven’t become a love romance yet,” Petkovic said. “But I’m working on it. A few candlelight dinners with the grass and we’ll see.” The German has never made it past the third round at Wimbledon.\n\nSECOND DOUBLE BAGEL\n\nRoger Federer was perfect in his quarterfinal match at the Gerry Weber Open. And it was Mischa Zverev who paid the price. The Swiss master posted only his second career double bagel as he blanked Zverev 6-0 6-0 at the Gerry Weber Open. “It’s not something which is easy to do,” Federer said. “You never go into a match aiming for that score. I was very surprised that it happened, especially on grass.” It took just 39 minutes for Federer to close out his easy win. “I hope he doesn’t take it too badly,” Federer said. “I just had a pretty easy time picking up his serve, and I must have made a ton of returns.” He got his first double bagel against Gaston Gaudio at the 2005 Masters Cup in Shanghai, China, and said the only time he lost a match without winning a game was his first match at the age of 8. Zverev was philosophical about the beating. “I’d rather lost 6-0 6-0 to Roger in a quarterfinal” than to a qualifier in the second round,” Zverev said. “At least there is something to talk about later.”\n\nSHOWING IMPROVEMENT\n\nOn her way to the final of the WTA event in Nürnberg, Germany, Andrea Petkovic upset top-seeded Jelena Jankovic. Both players received wild card entries into the tournament. Petkovic had missed months of action due to various injuries. Once ranked in the top 10, she had dropped to 103rd in the world. “I am glad my body has allowed me to play tennis again,” Petkovic said. “It was also mentally important for me to play such a match against a top-20 player.’” Serving for the match at 5-3, Petkovic lost the first three points, falling to a 0-40 deficit. But her Serb opponent produced error after error, giving Petkovic the victory.\n\nSOUTHERN CAL OPEN PARTNER\n\nTonic by Martina Hingis has been named the Official Clothing Partner of the Southern California Open, a WTA Premier 700 event that will be held July 27-August 4 in Carlsbad, California, USA. The youngest Grand Slam tournament champion of this era and the youngest player to be ranked number one in the world, Hingis will be inducted into the International Tennis Hall of Fame next month. She is collaborating with Tonic to create her own signature tennis collection. The pieces were created for the high intensity movements of tennis.\n\nSIGNED UP\n\nSerbia’s top two female players – Ana Ivanovic and Jelena Jankovic – along with Italy’s Flavia Pennetta have announced they will be play in the Southern California Open, a major stop on the Emirates Airline US Open Series calendar. Others in the field include reigning Australian Open champion Victoria Azarenka and 2012 Wimbledon finalist Agnieszka Radwanska. The 28th edition of the Southern California Open will be played at the La Costa Resort and Spa.\n\nSICK BAY\n\nGael Monfils has pulled out of Wimbledon for “personal reasons.” The 26-year-old Frenchman has just returned to action after being sidelined with a knee injury. He said he withdrew his request for a Wimbledon wild card because he had to deal with a personal problem that could not be delayed. He didn’t elaborate. Once ranked as high as seventh in the world, Monfils fell to 119th in the ATP rankings before rebounding to 67th following a series of good results.\n\nSPOTS SECURED\n\nRafael Nadal has already earned a spot in the Barclay’s ATP World Tour Finals, which will be held in London on November 4-11. Since returning from a knee injury that sidelined him for seven months, Nadal has reached the final in all of the nine events he has played, winning seven titles, including a record eighth French Open crown. While Nadal is currently fifth in the world rankings, he is first in the current Race standings and guaranteed a top-eight finish and end-of-season showpiece event. Nadal missed last year’s World Tour Finals due to the knee injury that also forced him out of the London Olympics, the US Open and this year’s Australian Open. He has qualified for the ATP World Tour Finals for nine straight yeas. In 2010, Nadal lost to Roger Federer in the title match.\n\nAlso qualifying for the season-ending event are brothers Bob and Mike Bryan, the world’s top-ranked doubles team. The 35-year-old American twins are three-time ATP World Tour Finals champions, winning in 2003-04 and 2009. The Bryans have qualified for the season finale for the 12th consecutive year. They are trying to finish the season ranked number one in the world for a ninth time and fifth consecutive season.\n\nSUSPENDED\n\nYannick Ebbinghaus of the Netherlands has been suspended for six months and fined USD $10,000 for violating tennis’s betting rules. The International Tennis Federation (ITF) said the 23-year-old Ebbinghaus admitted to 67 violations between May 2012 and February 2013. The ITF said he can cut three months off his suspension if he commits no future violations and attends anti-corruption education training. If Ebbinghaus cooperates with the Tennis Integrity Unit (TIU) in educating others about the ban on betting, half of his fine will be waived. Under tennis rules, players are prohibited from betting on matches.\n\nSISTERS AND SELES\n\nSisters Venus and Serena Williams will play a doubles exhibition match against Monica Seles and Canada’s Eugenie Bouchard to kick off the Rogers Cup competition in Toronto, Canada. The match will be played August 5 on the opening night of the week-long WTA tournament. A member of the International Tennis Hall of Fame, Seles will be returning to Toronto for the first time since she was inducted into the Rogers Cup Hall of Fame in 2009. She won the Rogers Cup in 1995 following a two-year absence from the sport after being stabbed by a spectator at a match in Hamburg, Germany. Bouchard won the Wimbledon junior girls singles in 2012. The Williams sisters had received a wild card into the French Open women’s doubles, but withdrew because of an injury suffered by Venus.\n\nSTILL REMEMBERED\n\nThey remember Nicolas Mahut at Wimbledon. Still reaping the fruits of his record 11-hour, 5-minute marathon match against John Isner in 2010, Mahut has been given a wild card into this year’s tournament. Mahut lost the first-round match 70-68 in the fifth set. He currently is ranked 224th in the world and could not have entered the main draw without a wild card. The 31-year-old Mahut teamed with fellow Frenchman Michael Llodra to reach the French Open doubles where they lost to American brothers Bob and Mike Bryan.\n\nSINGLES ACHIEVEMENT\n\nThanks to four rain delays, it took more than five hours before Sam Querrey was able to wrap up his 200th career singles victory. That came on the American’s 7-6 (11) 5-7 7-6 (5) win over Aljaz Bedene in the second round at the Queen’s Club grass-court tournament in London, Great Britain. Querrey saved a match point at 6-5 before winning the tiebreaker and wrapping up the victory. Bedene fell hard while hitting a cross-court forehand winner. He received medical attention but was not injured.\n\nSHARED PERFORMANCES\n\nBirmingham: Ashleigh Barty and Casey Dellacqua beat Cara Black and Marina Erakovic 7-5 6-4\n\nHalle: Scott Lipsky and Santiago Gonzalez beat Daniele Bracciali and Jonathan Erlich 6-2 7-6 (3)\n\nLondon: Bob Bryan and Mike Bryan beat Alexander Peya and Bruno Soares 4-6 7-5 10-3 (match tiebreak)\n\nNürnberg: Raluca Olaru and Valeria Solovyeva beat Anna-Lena Groenefeld and Kveta Peschke 2-6 7-6 (3) 11-9 (match tiebreak)\n\nSURFING\n\nEastbourne: www.lta.org.uk/\n\n‘s-Hertogenbosch: www.topshelfopen.nl/\n\nWimbledon: www.wimbledon.com\n\nTOURNAMENTS THIS WEEK\n\n(All money in USD)\n\nMEN\n\n$618,000 Aegon International, Eastbourne, Great Britain, grass\n\n$541,600 Topshelf Open, ‘s-Hertogenbosch, the Netherlands, grass\n\nWOMEN\n\n$637,000 Aegon International, Eastbourne, Great Britain, grass\n\n$235,000 Topshelf Open, ‘s-Hertogenbosch, the Netherlands, grass\n\nTOURNAMENTS NEXT WEEK\n\nMEN and WOMEN\n\nThe Championships, Wimbledon, Great Britain, grass (first week)\n\nBy Bob Greene\n\nSTARS\n\nStanislas Wawrinka beat David Ferrer 6-1 6-4 to win the Portugal Open men’s singles in Oeiras, Portugal\n\nTommy Haas beat Philipp Kohlschreiber 6-3 7-6 (3) to win the BMW Open in Munich, Germany\n\nAnastasia Pavlyuchenkova beat Carla Suárez Navarro 7-5 6-2 to win the women’s singles at the Portugal Open in Oeiras, Portugal\n\nAdrian Ungur beat Diego Sebastian Schwartzman, 4-6 6-0 6-2 to win the Tunis Open in Tunis, Tunisia\n\nJiri Vesely beat Steve Darcis 6-4 6-4 to win the Prosperita Open 2013 in Ostrava, Czech Republic\n\nVasek Pospisil beat Michal Przysiezny 6-7 (7) 6-0 6-1 to win the Soweto Open in Johannesburg, South Africa\n\nSAYING\n\n“It’s a sensational feeling to be quite honest. It was another one of those milestones that I hoped for, to maybe win this title one year. To have done that, this late in my career, is a big highlight for me.” – Tommy Haas, after winning the BMW Open.\n\n“It feels great to have won a title again, as it was one of my goals at the start of the year. It was a challenge against a top four player. I am very happy with the way I played today. I was really focused and I made it difficult for him on my serve.” – Stanislas Wawrinka, after upsetting David Ferrer to win the Portugal Open men’s singles.\n\n“Stan played a great match. I was never close to winning.” – David Ferrer.\n\n“She was holding me back on the baseline, putting a lot of spin on the ball and moving me around. But I just tried to start playing point by point, fighting every point. It wasn’t easy, but I just tried to dig deep and fight, and that really helped me in the end.” – Anastasia Pavlyuchenkova, who won the Portugal Open women’s title by beating Carla Suárez Navarro.\n\n“Today I had chances to win the first set, but Nastia was playing so well at those moments, and then she played really, really well in the second set. She just kept getting better as the match went on and deserved to win today. But it was a really good week for me. I’m very happy I was able to make another final here.” – Carla Suárez Navarro.\n\n“I think today both of us were so nervous and so tight. We’re just glad it’s finally over. It wasn’t the prettiest match for both teams, but we had some good points and definitely happy to win.” – Dmitry Tursunov, who teamed with Jarkko Nieminen to win the doubles in Munich, Germany.\n\n“It feels extremely good. I don’t have that many (doubles) titles.” – Jarkko Nieminen, who won his third career ATP World Tour doubles crown.\n\nBrad Drewett\n\n“Today is a very sad day for sport and tennis in particular. Our president Brad has passed away.” – Rafael Nadal.\n\n“He was always very nice to work with. Very honest and gentle. For me, it was hard seeing him not be the same anymore towards the end physically. But we can only appreciate what he’s done for us and what he did until the last moment he really possibly could. That will never go away.” – Roger Federer.\n\n“He was a very brave man with the courage to stand up and try to change some things in our sport for the better. We remember him as a very calm, composed and intelligent man who loved this sport with all his heart while he was playing, coaching, and then as the president of ATP.” – Novak Djokovic.\n\n“His knowledge, experience and enthusiasm will be a great loss to the whole sport.” – Francesco Ricci Bitti, International Tennis Federation (ITF) president.\n\n“The recent prize money increases with the Grand Slams are perfect examples of Brad’s brilliant strategic management, and another example of how much he cared about our athletes and the sport’s long-term growth. His legacy as a leader, as a person, and as a father who always put his family first, will have an everlasting impact on tennis.” – Stacey Allaster, WTA Chairman and CEO.\n\n“The tennis world lost a strong leader, true gentleman and a great friend today in ATP Executive Chairman and President Brad Drewett. Brad left an indelible mark on the game and everyone who knew him.” –David Haggerty, USTA chairman, CEO and president.\n\n“Tennis has lost a great leader and human being who accomplished so much for the sport he loved.” – Ken Solomon, Tennis Channel chairman and CEO.\n\nSAD NEWS\n\nBrad Drewett, a player, tournament director and executive chairman and president of the ATP, lost his battle with motor neurone disease, also referred to as Lou Gehrig’s Disease. He was 54. The Australian has been credited with making a number of changes within tennis and securing a greater share of Grand Slam tournament revenue for players as well as growing the sport in Asia. Recently, he was listed by the Sports Business Journal as one of the 50 most influential people in sport. Before he retired from playing in 1990, Drewett was ranked in the top 40 in singles and top 20 in doubles. In 2006, he was named ATP Chief Executive Officer for the International Group, overseeing the operations in the Middle East, Asia and Pacific regions. From 2003 to 2005 he led the region as Managing Director. In January 2012, he was named ATP executive chairman and president. This past January, he announced he had amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, a disease that affects voluntary muscle activity, including speaking, walking, breathing and swallowing. When he announced a new sponsor on the opening day of the Australian Open, his speech was noticeably slurred. He had planned to step down once a successor was found. He died at his home in Sydney, Australia.\n\nSENIOR STUD\n\nAge is just a number to Tommy Haas. In his 10th attempt at the Munich, Germany, tournament, the 35-year-old won the BMW Open for the first time. And he beat defending champion Philipp Kohlschreiber in the first all-German final in Munich in 48 years. “I can hardly believe that I still managed to win here after such a long career,” Haas said. He became the first 35-year-old to win an ATP Tour title since Fabrice Santoro captured Newport, Rhode Island, USA, in 2008. It was Haas’s fourth title in Germany and 14th overall. With the victory, Haas will move up to 13th in the world rankings. So far this year Haas has reached the final in San Jose, California, USA, and upset top-ranked Novak Djokovic in his run to the semifinals in Miami, Florida, USA. “Every time you win a title, it’s a reflection of putting everything together the whole week,” Haas said. “It doesn’t happen that often. You’re really proud of those moments.”\n\nSTAN’S THE MAN\n\nSwitzerland’s Stanislas Wawrinka, playing aggressively right from the start, dominated their baseline rallies to upset top-seeded David Ferrer and win the Portugal Open. “Stan played pretty well from the baseline and he had a good percentage of first services. He surpassed me in everything,” Ferrer said after losing to Wawrinka for just the fourth time in 11 career meetings. The winner won the first five games of the match and closed out the opening set in 30 minutes. With the two tied at 4 in the second set, Wawrinka broke Ferrer at 30, then held to capture his fourth career ATP World Tour title and first of 2013. “It is going to be tough to return to the Top 10, but I am definitely playing better than last year and I am improving,” said Wawrinka, who is ranked 16th in the world. “Today I got the confidence that I can beat a top four player in a final on a clay court.”\n\nSICK CALL\n\nJuan Martin del Potro withdrew from the Madrid Open because of a viral infection. Last year the Argentine reached the semifinals at the Spanish clay court event. “He has a virus and will not be fit to play. We wish him a fast recovery,” a statement on the tournament’s website said. David Goffin of Belgium took del Potro’s place in the main draw.\n\nSIDELINED\n\nBig-serving Ivo Karlovic of Croatia is recovering in a hospital in Miami, Florida, USA after being admitted with viral meningitis. Ranked as high as 14th in the world at one time, Karlovic was rumored to have suffered a stroke. But his wife Alsi said it wasn’t true. “Ivo did not have a stroke, as some outlets have stated,” she said in a statement released by the ATP Tour. “Rather, he has viral meningitis. We ask for privacy during his recovery process. We thank everyone for their support and well wishes.” The 6-foot-10 (2.08m) Karlovic last played at a Challenger in Sarasota, Florida, USA, last month.\n\nSTRING CONTINUES\n\nFor a while it looked as if Carla Suárez Navarro was finally going to beat Anastasia Pavlyuchenkova and win a tournament title. Both would be firsts for the Spaniard. Alas, neither was to be. Suárez Navarro took a 5-3 lead in the opening set. But Pavlyuchenkova staved off three set points – one in the ninth game and two more in the 10th – before winning 10 of the last 12 games of the match. “I had a slow start, the Russian said. “I was a little bit disappointed about that. It was the third match this week I started like that. Also, Carla was playing really well.” The winner called her coach – Martina Hingis – onto the court in the first set. “I think I just needed some positive words from Martina out there,” Pavlyuchenkova said. It paid off as she beat Suárez Navarro for the fifth time without a loss and captured her fifth career title – her first on clay. Suárez Navarro fell to 0-5 in WTA finals.\n\nSTOPPED BY BACK\n\nA back problem has caused Venus Williams to withdraw from the Madrid Open. The 32-year-old American, once ranked number one in the world, pulled out of the clay-court event before her first-round match against Spanish wild card Anabel Medina Garrigues. Williams was replaced in the draw by Switzerland’s Stefanie Voegele, who lost to Medina Garrigues 6-3 6-3.\n\nSENT TO JAIL?\n\nEuropean media is reporting that Bernard Tomic’s father, John, has been arrested after allegedly head-butting his son’s training partner, Thomas Drouet. There are reports that the 29-year-old Drouet’s nose was broken after the former tour player tried to break up an argument between the Tomics. In a statement, Tennis Australia said it was working closely with ATP officials who are investigating the incident. The ruckus reportedly occurred after Bernard Tomic suffered his third first-round loss of the year, this time to Czech veteran Radek Stepanek at the Madrid Open.\n\nSAYS NO\n\nThe International Tennis Federation (ITF) backed the referee who awarded a Davis Cup Asia/Oceania Group II tie to New Zealand because of an unplayable court. Pakistan was defaulted when their home tie played in Myanmar was halted because of a hole in the court. Pakistan had won the first match and was leading in the second when referee Ashita Ajigala of Sri Lanka ruled that the grass court in Yangon had become unplayable and dangerous. The Pakistan Tennis Federation (PTF) appealed the ruling, but the ITF’s Davis Cup Committee upheld the referee’s decision. There were only two grass courts at the facility where the tie was played. “The Committee noted that the poor quality of the original match court led the referee to designate the practice court as the match court,” the ITF said in its statement. The tie was played in Myanmar after New Zealand refused to visit Pakistan because of safety concerns. The PTF could still appeal to the ITF Board of Directors, the ITF statement said.\n\nSET FOR PARIS\n\nAlex Kuznetsov and Shelby Rogers have earned wild cards into the main draw at the French Open. Kuznetsov received the men’s wild card by having the best combined results at clay court Challenger tournaments in Sarasota and Tallahassee, Florida, USA, as well as Savannah, Georgia, USA. Rogers earned her wild card in the women’s singles main draw by accumulating the greatest number of WTA ranking points at two of the three USTA Pro Circuit USD $50,000 clay-court events in Dothan, Alabama; Charlottesville, Virginia, and Indian Harbour Beach, Florida, USA. The 26-year-old Kuznetsov was the junior runner-up at Roland Garros in 2004. When she was a junior, the 20-yearold Rogers won the USTA Girls’ 18s National Championship to earn a wild card into the main draw of the 2010 US Open, her only appearance in a Grand Slam tournament main draw.\n\nSHOWTIME FOR SISTERS\n\nA documentary about the Williams sisters in 2011 – Venus and Serena – will have its theatrical release this week. Serena, in a video introduction that will be shown at a theater in New York City, says that 2011 was “one of the most difficult years of my whole entire life.” The New York screening will be hosted by Billie Jean King and John McEnroe. Maiken Baird and Michelle Major spent almost four years trying to convince the sisters to participate in the first feature-length documentary on their lives. At the time of the negotiations, Serena and Venus were ranked one and two in the world. But just after the filming began in January 2011, Venus dropped out of the Australian Open with a hip injury, the first time she had ever withdrawn from a Grand Slam tournament. A couple months later, Serena was hospitalized with a pulmonary embolism. By September, Venus announced she had been diagnosed with Sjögren’s syndrome, an autoimmune disease that can cause muscle pain, arthritis and fatigue. The film also deals with their father, Richard Williams, and has little-seen footage from their early days in Compton, California, USA.\n\nSECRETS?\n\nChris Evert has struck back at her former fiancé Jimmy Connors, who hinted in a new book at their relationship ended because she had an abortion. “In his book, Jimmy Connors has written about a time in our relationship that was very personal and emotionally painful,” Evert said in a statement. “I am extremely disappointed that he used the book to misrepresent a private matter that took place 40 years ago and made it public without my knowledge. I hope everyone can understand that I have no further comment.” The two were at the top of tennis when they both won Wimbledon singles titles in 1974 and were due to get married later that year. In his memoir, “The Outsider,” Connors hints he broke off the relationship. “An issue had arisen as a result of youthful passion,” he wrote. “I was perfectly happy to let nature take its course and accept responsibility for what was to come. Chrissie, however, had already made up her mind that the timing was bad and too much was riding on her future. … It was a horrible feeling, but I knew it was over. Getting married wasn’t going to be good for either of us.” Evert was 19 at the time, Connors three years older.\n\nSIGNED UP\n\nDefending champion Marin Cilic, former world number one Lleyton Hewitt and American Sam Querrey will play the AEGON Championships at Queen’s Club in June. The field for the grass-court warm-up for Wimbledon also includes Andy Murray, Tomas Berdych, Juan Martin del Potro and Jo Wilfried Tsonga. The tournament begins June 10. While Cilic will be seeking a second straight title, Hewitt will be going for a record fifth crown. The Australian is tied with Boris Becker, John McEnroe and Andy Roddick with four Queen’s Club titles.\n\nTwo of the players – Andy Murray and Tomas Berdych – are already scheduled to play on finals day. Murray and Tim Henman will play Berdych and Ivan Lendl in Rally Against Cancer, a doubles exhibition to raise money for the Royal Marsden Cancer Charity.\n\nSHOULDER SURGERY\n\nDavid Nalbandian has undergone surgery on his right shoulder. The Argentine’s shoulder was operated on by his personal doctor, Angel Luis Cotorro, in Barcelona, Spain. Nalbandian said he hopes to be recovered in time to play for Argentina against the Czech Republic in a Davis Cup World Group semifinal in September. Doctors have said it will take four months for Nalbandian to recover.\n\nSTRONG FIELD\n\nFor the first time in nine years, Rafael Nadal will play in Roger Federer’s hometown tournament. Organizers of the Swiss Indoors in Basel, Switzerland, said their field for the October 19-27 event will be headed by five-time champion Federer, Nadal and defending champion Juan Martin del Potro. The last time he played in Basel, in 2004, Nadal lost a first-round match to Rainer Schuettler of Germany. He also lost early to another Spaniard, Feliciano Lopez, in 2003, the only year he and Federer were both in the Basel field. The Swiss Indoors, played on carpet then, is now a hard-court tournament.\n\nSUGARPOVA\n\nMaria Sharapova made a one-day trip to Moscow to present her “Sugarpova” candy brand to the Russian market. She has introduced her candy to several other markets, including the United States. But she says tennis remains her main focus. “Right now tennis is the most important for me,” she said. She also said she plans to compete in the 2016 Olympics in Rio de Janeiro. A small pack of “Sugarpova” sweets sells in Moscow for 175 rubles (USD $5.66).\n\nSERVING UP PORSCHES\n\nRumors are floating that the new Porsche 911 4S being driven by Bulgarian tennis star Grigor Dimitrov is a present from Maria Sharapova. The Swiss media is reporting that Dimitrov’s new vehicle is the same car Sharapova received for winning the Porsche Open in Stuttgart, Germany. “I am not a car collector, but my friend is mad about them,” Sharapova said. In his bio, Dimitrov lists cars among his hobbies. Dimitrov, who turns 22 later this month, and the 26-year-old Sharapova have been an item since the start of the year. And while neither player has confirmed the relationship, they haven’t denied it either.\n\nSHARED PERFORMANCES\n\nJohannesburg: Prakash Amritraj and Rajeev Ram bat Purav Raja and Divu Sharan 7-6 (1) 7-6 (1)\n\nMunich: Jarkko Nieminen and Dmitry Tursunov beat Marcos Baghdatis and Eric Butorac 6-1 6-4\n\nOeiras (men): Santiago Gonzalez and Scott Lipsky beat Aisam-Ul-Haq Qureshi and Jean-Julien Rojer 6-3 4-6 10-7 (match tiebreak)\n\nOeiras (women): Chian Hao-Ching and Kristina Mladenovic beat Darija Jurak and Katalin Marosi 7-6 (3) 6-2\n\nOstrava: Steve Darcis and Olivier Rochus beat Tomasz Bednarek and Mateuz Kowalczyk 7-5 7-5\n\nTunis: Domink Meffert and Philipp Oswald beat Jamie Delgado and Andreas Siljestrom 3-6 7-6 (0) 10-7 (match tiebreak)\n\nSURFING\n\nMadrid: www.madrid-open.com/\n\nCagnes-Sur-Mer: www.opendecagnes.com\n\nRome: www.internazionalibnlditalia.com/\n\nPrague: www.spartapragueopen.cz\n\nBordeaux: www.atp-primrosebordeaux.com/\n\nTOURNAMENTS THIS WEEK\n\n(All money in USD)\n\nMEN\n\n$4,404,383 Mutua Madrid Open, Madrid, Spain, clay\n\n$125,000 Kunming Challenger, Kunming, China, hard\n\nWOMEN\n\n$5,273,930 Mutua Madrid Open, clay\n\n$100,000 Open de Cagnes-Sur-Mer Alpes-Maritimes, Cagnes-Sur-Mer, France, clay\n\nTOURNAMENTS NEXT WEEK\n\nMEN\n\n$3,470,878 Internazionali BNL d’Italia, Rome, Italy, clay\n\n$111,351 BNP Paribas Primrose Bordeaux, Bordeaux, France\n\nWOMEN\n\n$2,369,000 Internazionali BNL d’Italia, Rome, Italy, clay\n\n$100,000 Sparta Prague Open, Prague, Czech Republic, clay\n\nBy Bob Greene\n\nSTARS\n\nNovak Djokovic beat Rafael Nadal 6-2 7-6 (1) to win the Monte Carlo Rolex Masters in Monte Carlo, Monaco\n\nAlex Kuznetsov beat Wayne Odesnik 6-0 6-2 to win the Sarasota Open in Sarasota, Florida, USA\n\nFED CUP\n\nWorld Group Semifinals\n\nItaly beat Czech Republic 3-1 at Palermo, Italy\n\nRussia beat Slovak Republic 3-2 at Moscow, Russia\n\nWorld Group Playoffs\n\nGermany beat Serbia 3-2 at Stuttgart, Germany; Australia beat Switzerland 3-1 at Chiasso-Seseglio, Switzerland; Spain beat Japan 4-0 at Barcelona, Spain; United States beat Sweden 3-2 at Delray Beach, Florida, USA\n\nWorld Group II Playoffs\n\nPoland beat Belgium 4-1 at Koksijde, Belgium; France beat Kazakhstan 4-1 at Besançon, France; Argentina beat Great Britain 3-1 at Buenos Aires, Argentina; Canada beat Ukraine 3-2 at Kiev, Ukraine\n\nGroup II\n\nEurope/Africa Zone at Ulcinj, Montenegro: Latvia and Tunisia promoted to Europe/Africa Zone Group I in 2014\n\nSAYING\n\n“Rafa, thank you for allowing me to win it once. I couldn’t ask for a better start to the clay season.” – Novak Djokovic, after ending Rafael Nadal’s 46-match winning streak at Monte Carlo.\n\n“It is not a tragedy. I lost after eight years without losing here. Today, he was better than me. …. He’s a fantastic player. If you are not at 100 per cent, (it) is very difficult to win against these kinds of players. His game is very complete. To win, I have to play my best and I have to bring him to the limit.” – Rafael Nadal, after losing the Monte Carlo Rolex Masters final to Novak Djokovic.\n\n“To be honest, I wanted to be out there. I told Mary Joe (Fernandez, the USA captain) yesterday I feel good, I feel positive. I pumped myself up and I wanted to be there for the team.” – Venus Williams, after winning the clinching match in the United States Fed Cup victory over Sweden.\n\n“At the end of the day, experience just goes a long way. Venus has been there so many times before. To have her in that clinching match for me was really important.” – Mary Joe Fernandez, USA Fed Cup captain, on having Venus Williams replace Sloane Stephens in the reverse singles against Sweden.\n\n“Today was also fun to play, even though I lost.” – Sofia Arvidsson, following her loss to Serena Williams after upsetting Sloane Stephens on the opening day of the Sweden-United States Fed Cup tie.\n\n“He was extremely good today, and this is also what I call the champion’s luck. The top players are able to do that.” – Jo-Wilfried Tsonga, after Rafael Nadal scooped the ball off his ankles for a winning shot down the line.\n\n“I am losing a bit of intensity at some moments. That’s normal after a long time out of competition.” – Rafael Nadal, following his hard-fought 6-2 2-6 6-4 quarterfinal victory over Grigor Dimitrov.\n\n“I made a lot of mistakes – 24 unforced errors is far too many … that’s where half the points went.” – Andy Murray, after being upset by Stanislas Wawrinka at the Monte Carlo Masters.\n\n“I am very happy that I fell down. I forgot the score when I came back, and (something) came back in my head. The crowd helped so much. Sometimes I just really enjoy playing, and it was a great fight.” – Ekaterina Makarova, who helped lead Russia to a its Fed Cup win after taking a medical time out for treatment to her knee and finger she bloodied in a fall.\n\n“She’s amazing. We were joking that she’s like a soldier. She has a bleeding knee and she won such an amazing match – one of the most emotional matches she has won. And then in the doubles she was feeling tired, but she’s a great fighter.” – Elena Vesnina, who teamed with Ekaterina Makarova to win the tie-clinching doubles in Russia’s Fed Cup victory over the Slovak Republic.\n\n“We were a little bit lucky, of course. When you save seven match points, you need a little bit of luck. But we played very well on those points. We still believed in ourselves until the end and it paid off.” – Julien Benneteau, who teamed with Nenad Zimonjic to win the doubles at the Monte Carlo Masters.\n\n“It was unbelievable. They started unbelievable (after the rain break), without missing any shots. Julien had to hit an ace on the second serve at 5-4 and also had an unbelievable return of the first serve to save another match point. It was just amazing to come up as the winners in our first tournament together. They are such champions. We knew they were going to come out strong. They never give up. We really had to play unbelievable to win at the end.” – Nenad Zimonjic, who with Julien Benneteau, won the Monte Carlo Masters doubles by beating brothers Bob and Mike Bryan.\n\nSUPER SERB\n\nRafael Nadal’s remarkable streak on the red clay at Monte Carlo finally ended after 10 years of triumph. The Spaniard had won 46 consecutive matches before losing in the final to Novak Djokovic. Nadal’s last defeat in the event was to Guillermo Coria 10 years ago. Since then he had won the title eight straight times, an ATP record for one tournament, and had beaten Djokovic in the final last year. The Serb had played a year despite the death of his grandfather during the tournament. And he wasn’t sure he would play this year after twisting his ankle while playing Davis Cup against the United States two weeks ago. “I didn’t know I would be a part of the tournament this year,” Djokovic said. “(It’s) the best decision I ever made in my life.” He dominated Nadal in the opening set, winning the first five games of the match. Nadal took the next two games before Djokovic closed out of the opening set. It was Nadal who led 4-2 in the second set. But Djokovic broke him at love, and then lost only one point in the tiebreaker. Since returning from a knee injury in February, Nadal has reached five consecutive finals, winning three. Djokovic has won three titles this year, including the Australian Open, and 37 in his career. While Nadal owns a 19-15 advantage over Djokovic in their career meetings, the two have split evenly the 16 finals in which they met.\n\nSURGE\n\nIt was Ekaterina Makarova to the rescue to lead Russia into the Fed Cup final. The Slovak Republic won the first two singles matches and appeared headed to victory. But after Maria Kirilenko won the opening reverse singles, Makarova replaced Anastasia Pavlyuchenkova in the lineup and drew Russia even with a 6-3 4-6 6-4 victory over Daniela Hantuchova. It was Makarova’s first career win over the Slovak veteran. That set the stage for the doubles, where Makarova teamed with Elena Vesnina to grab a spot in the final with a 4-6 6-3 6-1 victory over Dominika Cibulkova and Hantuchova. The Russians will take on Italy, which the defending Fed Cup champion Czech Republic, in the final in November.\n\nSISTERS DOING IT\n\nWhen times got tough, Mary Joe Fernandez turned to the veteran on her roster. And Venus Williams came through with a win to keep the United States in the Fed Cup World Group. Somewhat surprisingly, it was the first time in her Fed Cup career that Venus had clinched a Fed Cup tie for the United States. But it wasn’t easy. She needed eight match points before besting Sweden’s Johanna Larsson 6-3 7-5. “I wasn’t keeping track,” Williams said of the match points. “I was just trying to stay focused on getting the win for the US.” Venus got the call after her younger sister, Serena, easily won her second match of the weekend to pull the Americans in front 2-1 in their best-of-5 competition against Sweden. Sofia Arvidsson had given Sweden its first point when she surprised Sloane Stephens in the opening match. The win improved Venus Williams’ Fed Cup record to 15-2 in singles, and 19-4 overall. Serena improved her Fed Cup singles record to 10-0 with a 6-2 6-1 win over Arvidsson in the first reverse singles match.\n\nSTUTTGART WIN\n\nPlaying in Stuttgart, Germany’s doubles team pulled out a victory over Serbia to keep the home country in the Fed Cup World Group next year. “I said this morning to Anna, ‘You know we’re going to be so ready for the match if we reach 2-2,’” Germany’s Sabine Lisicki said, referring to Anna-Lena Groenefeld. The pair led from the outset to beat Vesna Dolonc and Aleksandra Krunic 6-2 6-4. With the loss, Serbia falls back to World Group II next year. “It was a perfect doubles,” German coach Barbara Rittner said. “I was very relieved when we won it.”\n\nSERVICE TO FED CUP\n\nChris Evert is the latest tennis legend to be honored for her Fed Cup dedication by the International Tennis Federation (ITF). The International Tennis Hall of Fame member was given a replica Fed Cup trophy by the ITF during the competition between the United States and Sweden. Evert competed in 42 Fed Cup ties, posting a 57-4 record in the international team play. She helped the United States to Fed Cup titles in 1977, 1978, 1979, 1980, 1981, 1982, 1986 and 1989. “It’s very meaningful,” Evert said after receiving the trophy. “It was a big part of my career, representing the United States. I got to play with great players like Martina Navratilova, Pam Shriver, and Tracy Austin.”\n\nSTAR POWER\n\nAlthough Russia finally won its Fed Cup clash against the Slovak Republic, thanks to Ekaterina Makarova, the fans in Moscow probably were hoping the former players on their bench could take to the court. They included Larissa Savchenko, a former Grand Slam tournament doubles champion, represented the Soviet Union in more Fed Cup ties than any other Russian has since; Elena Likhovtseva, who won 26 matches in a nine-year period; and Anastasia Myskina, who won the French Open in 2004. Also at the competition was Martina Hingis, who now coaches Anastasia Pavlyuchenkova, a member of the Russian Fed Cup squad.\n\nSAYS WILL HEAR APPEAL\n\nThe Pakistan Tennis Federation says the International Tennis Federation (ITF) has agreed to hear an appeal by Pakistan against the awarding of their Davis Cup Asia-Oceania Group II tie to New Zealand. “It is a major breakthrough for us after we got confirmation from the ITF they will be hearing our appeal against the referee’s decision,” PTF secretary Mumtaz Yousuf told reporters. Ruling that the grass court in Yangon, Myanmar, had become unplayable and dangerous, Sri Lankan referee Shita Ajigala disqualified Pakistan and awarded the win to New Zealand. The tie was played in Myanmar after New Zealand refused to visit Pakistan due to security concerns. Pakistan had won the opening singles and was leading in the second when play was halted and New Zealand declared the winner. The appeal will be heard by the ITF’s Board of Directors next month.\n\nSTRING OF ERRORS\n\nAndy Murray blamed his own string of errors as a big factor in his 6-1 6-2 loss to Stanislas Wawrinka. Looking frustrated on the court, Murray won only eight points on his own serve in the first set and finished the match with 24 unforced errors. “I started hitting the ball shorter, then he was able to dictate the play,” Murray said. Wawrinka completed the stunning upset in just 58 minutes. With the victory, Wawrinka helped out Swiss countryman Roger Federer. The loss dropped Murray to third in the ATP World Tour Rankings, behind leader Novak Djokovic and Federer. “I need to do a lot of work,” Murray admitted.\n\nSO MUCH MONEY\n\nWhatever you call it – Euros, dollars, pesos, francs – one thing is certain. There will be a lot more money to spread around at this year’s French Open. Roland Garros organizers said the overall total for the tournament will go from USD $24.6 million to USD $28.7 million. This winners this year will pocket USD $1.96 million, compared to USD $1.64 million a year ago. But that’s not all. Players eliminated in the second, third and fourth rounds will receive 25 percent more than they did last year. French Tennis Federation director Gilbert Ysern says his organization “wishes to maintain its effort with regards to players eliminated during the first week.” The tournament begins May 26.\n\nSUB EXTRAORDINARE\n\nMaria Irigoyen was chosen for Argentina’s Fed Cup team to play only doubles. But when Florencia Molinero wasn’t up to her usual form, Irigoyen stepped in and beat Elena Baltacha 7-5 3-6 6-1 to lead her country to a Fed Cup by BNP Paribas World Group 2 playoff win over Great Britain. Baltacha, who had come back from retirement, also was subbing for another member of her team, Johanna Konta. The two teams split the opening two singles before Paula Ormaechea stopped Britain’s Laura Robson 6-4 4-6 6-2 in a battle of the team’s top players. That left it for Irigoyen, who wore down Baltacha in a baseline battle that lasted a little over 2½ hours. “They were tough defeats, we had lots of chances we didn’t manage to take,” Britain’s captain Judy Murray said. “Bally (Baltacha) played so well in practice all week, and I felt if I needed someone to go out there and deal with the conditions, she’s got such a great Fed Cup record and is a great competitor, I knew she would give everything. It was a risk – she’d not played much competitive tennis in the last six months – she nearly did it and I’m very proud of her.” Great Britain did not have Heather Watson, who is ill. Argentina’s captain Bettina Fulco said it made a difference. “It would have been too difficult for us if Watson had come,” Fulco said.\n\nSTOPPING THE BRYANS\n\nPlaying together for the first time, Julien Benneteau and Nenad Zimonjic reached the final of the Monte Carlo Rolex Masters only to find two-time defending champions Bob and Mike Bryan waiting for them. It made no difference as Benneteau and Zimonjic defeated the American brothers 4-6 7-6 (4) 14-12 (match tiebreak) to come away with the title. The winners saved seven match points in the rain-interrupted final. The match had been suspended with Benneteau and Zimonjic leading 3-0 in the second set.

Pakistan was on the verge of posting a 2-0 first-day lead in the best-of-five-match series when the ITF referee called the match in favor of New Zealand due to its perception of the court conditions.\n\nDue to security concerns in Pakistan, the ITF dictated that the Pakistanis would have to play the series at a neutral venue. A grass court at the Pun Hlaing Golf and Country Club in Yangon, Myanmar was selected by the Pakistani Tennis Federation and approved for play by the ITF.\n\nHowever, after Pakistan’s Ageel Khan beat New Zealand’s Artem Sitak 7-5, 3-6, 6-2, 7-5 and Qureshi lead Daniel King Turner 6-2, 3-6, 3-0 on the opening day of the series, the on-site ITF-selected neutral referee Asitha Attygalla deemed that a hole in the back of the grass court, described as being an inch deep and six inches wide, was endangering players and ruled that Pakistan would have to forfeit the tie immediately for not providing a playable court.\n\nAttygalla did not allow for a delay in play, by hours or even a day, to repair the court, choosing to immediately award the match to New Zealand by a 4-1 margin.\n\n“It has been a rough court from day one, concerns which we voiced,” New Zealand captain Alistair Hunt told Radio Sport as reported by Reuters. “The court only lasted about a match and a half before a reasonably good hole opened up on the baseline, which proved too dangerous to play on and the referee has called it.”\n\nPakistan Tennis Federation (PTF) President Kaleem Imam said to Reuters that Attygalla’s decision was a “disaster” and said, “Our manager said the players were very distraught after the referee’s decision. We spent thousands of dollars on preparing for this tie and sending a full-fledged squad to Yangon. We were desperate to win this tie and confident we could do it. We had no option but to complain to the ITF (International Tennis Federation) after the referee awarded the entire tie to New Zealand claiming the playing surface was dangerous.”\n\nLocal observers called Attygalla’s decision “shocking” and deemed the decision was an over-reaction as the court was repaired shortly after the match was awarded to New Zealand.\n\nAccording to Reuters, Pakistan have been forced to host many international sporting matches at neutral venues as foreign teams have refused to travel to the country after eight Pakistanis were killed following an attack on the Sri Lanka cricket team in March 2009. Attygalla, the neutral referee, is also a native of Sri Lanka and resides in Australia.\n\nQureshi, who won the doubles title at the recent Sony Open in Miami, plans to fly to London to meet with the ITF’s Davis Cup Committee and directly plead the case of his team and suggest that the two teams resume and complete the match at the club at Roehampton, England, within the shadow of the ITF’s headquarters. A group of Pakistani tennis supporters have set up a Facebook page here: https://www.facebook.com/DiscriminationWithPakistanTennisDavisCupTeam to support the effort.\n\nQureshi is one of the most respected players on the ATP Tour and gained international recognition when as a Muslim from Pakistan, he partnered with Amir Hadad, a Jew from Israel, at Wimbledon and the US Open in 2002. Their partnership received much international media attention and their photo appeared as the lead, above-the-fold image on the front page of The New York Times during the US Open, where they reached the third round. He was also placed in the spotlight in 2010 when he partnered and reached the US Open doubles final with Rohan Bopanna, a leading player from India, a nation with political differences with that of Qureshi’s Pakistan. Shortly after his US Open success (he also reached the mixed doubles final) Qureshi founded his non-profit foundation (www.StopWarStartTennis.org), created with the purpose of bringing hope through tennis to all those affected by war, sectarian conflict and landmines/unexploded ordinance.\n\nQureshi is a two-time winner of the ATP World Tour’s Arthur Ashe Humanitarian of the Year award (in 2002 with Hadad and 2010 with Bopanna) and in 2010 he was named a goodwill ambassador to the United Nations Development Program. In 2010, he was awarded the “Sitara-i-Imtiaz” (Star of Excellence) by the Government of Pakistan and also was given the Pakistan President’s Award for Performance in 2002, the Salam Pakistan Youth Award by the President of Pakistan in 2007 and, in 2003, he was a finalist for the Anne Frank Award For Moral Courage presented by the Anne Frank Trust.\n\nHis ebook STOP WAR, START TENNIS: LESSONS OF LIFE AND UNDERSTANDING FROM A PAKISTANI TENNIS PLAYER, (available for $4.99 in the United States here: http://www.amazon.com/Tennis-Lessons-Understanding-Pakistani-ebook/dp/B009XE3LLO/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1352133085&sr=8-1&keywords=Stop+War+STart+Tennis) details his inspiring stories of the life and tennis career with the hopes of inspiring people to learn from both defeats and triumphs in sports or other endeavors.\n\nBy Bob Greene\n\nSTARS\n\nHoracio Zeballos beat Rafael Nadal 6-7 (2) 7-6 (6) 6-4 to win the VTR Open in Viña del Mar, Chile\n\nRichard Gasquet beat Benoit Paire 6-2 6-3 to win the Open Sud de France in Montpellier, France\n\nMarin Cilic beat Jurgen Melzer 6-3 6-1 to win the PBZ Zagreb Indoors in Zagreb, Croatia\n\nRhyne Williams beat Robby Ginepri 7-5 6-3 to win the Challenger of Dallas in Dallas, Texas, USA\n\nLauren Davis beat Ajla Tomljanovic 6-3 2-6 7-6 (2) to win the Dow Corning Tennis Classic in Midland, Michigan, USA\n\nFED CUP\n\nFirst Round\n\nWorld Group\n\nCzech Republic beat Australia 4-0 at Ostrava, Czech Republic\n\nItaly beat the United States 3-2 at Rimini, Italy\n\nRussia beat Japan 3-2 at Moscow, Russia\n\nSlovak Republic beat Serbia 3-2 at Nis, Serbia\n\nWorld Group II\n\nSwitzerland beat Belgium 4-1 at Bern, Switzerland; Sweden beat Argentina 3-2 at Buenos Aires, Argentina; Spain beat Ukraine 3-1 at Alicante, Spain; Germany beat France 3-1 at Limoges, France\n\nZone Group I\n\n(Round Robin)\n\nEurope/Africa at Eilat, Israel: Great Britain and Poland advance to the World Group playoffs on April 20-21; Bosnia/Herzegovina and Georgia are relegated to Europe/Africa Zone Group II in 2014\n\nAmericas at Medellín, Colombia: Canada advances to the World Group playoffs on April 20-21; Chile and Peru are relegated to Americas Zone Group II for 2014\n\nAsia/Oceania at Astana, Kazakhstan: Kazakhstan advances to the World Group playoffs on April 20-21; India is relegated to Asia/Oceania Zone Group II for 2014.\n\nZone Group II\n\n(Round Robin)\n\nAsia/Oceania at Astana, Kazakhstan: Indonesia is promoted to Asia/Oceania Zone Group I for 2014\n\nSAYING\n\n“I’m shocked. I’ve beaten one of the best players of tennis history. It’s an incredible sensation.” – Horacio Zeballos, after upsetting Rafael Nadal in the final of a clay court tournament.\n\n“Although I didn’t make it (to win the tournament), for me it is a huge achievement playing all the week.” – Rafael Nadal, when he received the runner-up trophy.\n\n“It’s tough now. Before we had Kim (Clijsters), we had Justine (Henin) and, OK, now we have Yanina and Kirsten, and they’re a good team, too, together with the younger girls. But if one of them can’t play, it’s getting a lot tougher.” – Ann Devries, Belgian Fed Cup captain, after Belgium lost to Switzerland.\n\n“I felt I played an almost perfect match, for sure the best one in a year, year and a half. Everything worked perfectly – serve, return, movement on court.” – Marin Cilic, after winning the Zagreb Indoors for the third time.\n\n“In the morning when I was practicing, it was even difficult to walk. I took some pain-killers before the match and adrenaline helped me when I was on court. (Ekaterina) Makarova is a really tough player and it was hard to get many points out there, but I tried my best, but it just wasn’t enough.” – Kimiko Date-Krumm, who played despite her injury and lost her second singles match in Japan’s 3-2 loss to Russia.\n\n“It shows that I have had a good career so far, and when I started playing tennis I never dreamed of winning 300 matches on tour, especially reaching the Top 10. Winning 300 matches is something big.” – Jurgen Melzer, whose 300th career victory came against Lukas Rosol in the quarterfinals of the PBZ Zagreb Indoors.\n\n“Obviously it was a great week for us. Today, we think we played our best match of the tournament. We had to, because (Ivan) Dodig and (Mate) Pavic beat a lot of good teams this week.” – Julian Knowle, who teamed with Filip Polasek to win the Zagreb Indoors doubles.\n\n“We were leading 2-1 and we had a chance to win, but this is the Fed Cup and this is tennis. My players gave their best and that’s all I can ask of them. This is the start for us, not the finish. We only have three players in the top hundred, and if we want to improve our players need to get higher rankings. It’s a long way to reach this goal, but we need to try.” – Takeshi Murakami, Japan’s Fed Cup captain.\n\nSOUTH AMERICAN STUNNER\n\nRafael Nadal’s return didn’t go quite according to plan. Playing in his first tournament since losing early at Wimbledon last June, Nadal was shocked again as he fell to Argentine Horacio Zeballos in the VTR Open final to claim his first career title. “I still think I’m dreaming,” an emotional Zeballos said. “It’s an honor playing against him. I enjoyed being with him at the locker room, eating with him. He’s a great guy, I would like to ask him if he’s from this planet.” It was Zeballos who played as if he came from another planet. When Nadal served to stay in the match, he was broken by Zeballos to close out the nearly three-hour match. Nadal has been sidelined by a troublesome knee injury, and his comeback was delayed by illness. The reigning French Open champion is scheduled to play two more tournaments in his South and Central American swing. “This is one of the best weeks of the last months,” Nadal told the crowd following the match. “I want to thank you all.”\n\nSECOND STUMBLE\n\nRafael Nadal didn’t just fall in the singles final at Viña del Mar. The Spaniard also reached the title match in doubles, only to once again wind up with the runner-up trophy. Nadal and Juan Monaco lost to the Italian pair of Paolo Lorenzi and Potito Starace 6-2 6-4. It was Lorenzi’s first doubles final, while Starace captured his sixth crown in his ninth final. “I’m really happy because Potito and I are very good friends,” Lorenzi said. “It was a great victory for us against Monaco and Nadal. We hope to play in another tournament again as soon as possible.”\n\nSWISS TRIUMPH\n\nAfter dropping the opening singles match, surprising Switzerland rallied for a 4-1 first-round Fed Cup by BNP Paribas World Group II victory over visiting Belgium. With the win, Switzerland advanced to the World Group playoffs in April. Romina Oprandi and Stefanie Voegele won both of their “reverse” singles matches to clinch the victory. Oprandi, Switzerland’s top player, beat two higher-ranked opponents, Kirsten Flipkens and Yanina Wickmayer, losing just 10 games in the process. Voegele’s win over Alison van Uytvanck clinched the tie. “On paper they were the stronger side, but we had some compensation for that by playing at home and being able to choose the surface,” Swiss captain Heinz Guenthardt said. “But never mind that, I feel our players played absolutely at the maximum of their capacity and you can’t really ask for anything more. It was a perfect weekend.”\n\nSTILL WINNING\n\nMarin Cilic continued his winning ways in Zagreb, Croatia. The top-seeded Cilic won his nation’s top ATP event, the PBZ Zagreb Indoors, for the third time. This time he stopped Austria’s Jurgen Melzer in the title match. Cilic also won the Zagreb tournament in 2009 and 2010. He now has won nine career titles. Melzer was never in the contest as Cilic began the day by winning the first two games and racing to a 5-3 first-set lead. Melzer won just one more game. “He deserved the victory,” said Melzer. “It was a really good match he played – very well from the baseline, had good serve. I had to play for all points on my serve.”\n\nSECOND TITLE\n\nIn an all-French final, Richard Gasquet won his second title of the season, stopping Benoit Paire in the Open Sud de France in Montpellier. “It’s fabulous to win two titles in a season, especially so early,” Gasquet said. “I’m very motivated for the remainder of the season.” He also captured the Qatar Open in January and now has nine career titles. Paire was playing in only his second ATP Tour final, losing to Andreas Seppi in Belgrade, Serbia, last year. “I rushed a lot of my shots,” Paire said. “I thought about the final in Belgrade where things went bad for me. When I lost the first set 6-2, I told myself ‘it’s happening again.’ I think the result is a bit normal. You must play a few finals to know how it feels.”\n\nSPOTLESS STILL\n\nBeginning its run to a third straight Fed Cup championship, the Czech Republic crushed Australia 4-0, thanks to Petra Kvitova coming back from match point down to beat Samantha Stosur 2-6 7-6 (3) 6-4. “It was my first really good match this year,” Kvitova said in an on-court interview. “When I lost the first set I didn’t want to give up the match. I knew the next matches could be very tough, which is why I fought a lot, and the key was the tiebreak in the second set.” Stosur had lost her opening singles match to Lucie Safarova on two tiebreaks. Against Kvitova she played much better tennis. But after missing a match point 67 minutes into the match, it was Kvitova who picked up her game. “I don’t think I did much wrong today,” Stosur said. “It was one that just slipped away. Petra played a very good match. In the second set I thought we were both playing very high quality, and when it comes down to that, it was just a point here and a point there.”\n\nSLIPPING BY\n\nRussia had to battle to get past Japan, but it did just that in its first-round Fed Cup World Group tie. Japan’s Ayumi Morita won both of her singles matches, but Russia’s Elena Vesnina and Ekaterina Makarova captured the decisive doubles match to give the home squad a 3-2 victory. “It was tough, but it was an amazing couple of days for us and we are so happy that we beat Japan and it was very difficult for us,” Vesnina said. “Ekaterina was a real hero for us as she helped us win a couple of crucial points.” Makarova won her first Fed Cup singles match, besting Japanese veteran Kimiko Date-Krumm, to keep Russia in the contest. Then she teamed with Vesnina for the winning point. Suffering from an Achilles injury, Date-Krumm decided to play only minutes before the match was to begin. The 42-year-old said she decided to play as she believed it would be too much pressure to ask rookie Misaki Doi to play her first World Group singles match in such a pressurized situation.\n\nSUCCESSFUL\n\nMarc Gicquel and Michael Llodra were just doing what has become normal. They became the eighth all-French pair since 1987 to win the doubles at the Open Sud de France. It was their first ATP World Tour team title. “Now I can say that I won all the French tournaments – except Roland Garros – as Montpellier was the one I was missing,” Llodra said. “My objective in doubles is to beat Guy’s (Forget) doubles record of 28 titles. I won’t stop until I beat him.” Llodra has won 24 career doubles titles, while Gicquel won his first since the 2010 Brisbane International. “It’s been a great week for me and I want to thank ‘Mika’ for playing with me here in Montpellier,” Gicquel said. “We had a lot of fun on and off court and I am delighted that my fourth career title comes here in Montpellier and in France.”\n\nSHARED PERFORMANCES\n\nDallas: Alex Kuznetsova and Mischa Zverev beat Tennys Sandgren and Rhyne Williams 6-4 6-7 10-5 (match tiebreak)\n\nMidland: Melinda Czink and Mirjana Lucic-Baroni beat Maria-Fernanda Alves and Samantha Murray 5-7 6-4 10-7 (match tiebreak)\n\nMontpellier: Marc Gicquel and Michael Llodra beat Johan Brunstrom and Raven Klaasen 6-3 3-6 11-9 (match tiebreak)\n\nViña del Mar: Paolo Lorenzi and Potito Starace beat Juan Monaco and Rafael Nadal 6-2 6-4\n\nZagreb: Julian Knowle and Filip Polasek beat Ivan Dodig and Mate Pavic 6-3 6-3\n\nSURFING\n\nRotterdam: www.abnamrowtt.nl\n\nSan Jose: www.sapopentennis.com\n\nDoha: www.qatartennis.org\n\nSão Paulo: www.brasilopen.com.br\n\nCali: www.copabionaire.co/\n\nMemphis: www.memphistennis.com/\n\nMarseille: www.open13.fr\n\nBuenos Aires: http://copaclaro.com/atp/\n\nDubai: www.dubaidutyfreetennischampionships.com\n\nBogotá: www.copaclarocolsanitas.com\n\nTOURNAMENTS THIS WEEK\n\nMEN\n\n$1,728,200 ABN AMRO World Tennis Tournament, Rotterdam, the Netherlands, hard\n\n$546,930 SAP Open, San Jose, California, USA, hard\n\n$455,775 Brasil Open, São Paulo, Brazil, clay\n\nWOMEN\n\n$2,369,000 Qatar Total Open, Doha, Qatar, hard\n\n$125,000 Copa Bionare, Cali, Colombia, clay\n\nTOURNAMENTS NEXT WEEK\n\nMEN\n\n$1,212,750 US National Indoor Tennis Championships, Memphis, Tennessee, USA, hard\n\n$706,214 Open 13, Marseille, France, hard\n\n$493,670 Copa Claro, Buenos Aires, Argentina, clay\n\nWOMEN\n\n$2,000,000 Dubai Duty Free Tennis Championships, Dubai, United Arab Emirates, hard\n\n$235,000 US National Indoor Tennis Championships, Memphis, Tennessee, USA, hard\n\n$235,000 Copa Claro Colsanitas, Bogotá, Colombia, clay\n\nBy Justin Cohen\n\nATP Executive Chairman and President Brad Drewett to step down\n\nATP Executive Chairman and President Brad Drewett will step down from his current position after being diagnosed with Lou Gehrig’s disease. Drewett took over his current position in January 2012, having previously been a player on the ATP World Tour, as well as the CEO of the international region and tournament director of the ATP World Tour Finals. Drewett, 54, will continue the job on an ‘interim basis’ until the ATP board of directors appoint his successor. “It has been a privilege to serve as executive chairman and president of the ATP, an organization that I’ve been a part of for more than 35 years since I became a professional tennis player,” said Drewett. “I hold the ATP very close to my heart, and it’s with sadness that I make the decision to enter this transition period due to my ill-health.” Lou Gehrig’s disease, or Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS), affects voluntary muscle activity, including speaking, walking, breathing, swallowing and general movement of the body. It usually causes progressive disability.\n\nAustralian Open attendance already soaring through day two of action\n\nThe first Grand Slam of the year at the Australian Open in Melbourne has already produced many exciting matches and the fans are turning up in herds to see them.

Korean automotive company Kia will remain as the Open’s top commercial partner through to 2018. Along with supplying vehicles to the event, the company will once again support the popular Kia Open Drive initiative, in which players are transported to certain places – their hotel, a training session or special event – in a Kia vehicle set up with cameras, microphones and an iPad. The iPad generates questions for the player to answer regarding their hobbies, thoughts and stories from the tour. “This will make Kia, with 17 years of support for the Australian Open, the longest-running major sponsor in the 108-year history of this iconic Grand Slam event,” said Kia Motors Australia CEO Charlie Kim. “We believe the excitement and enthusiasm and passion displayed on the court (by players) here in Melbourne… is the perfect embodiment of what the Kia brand stands for.” Rolex will become the official timekeeper of the ATP World Tour, while the agreement also sees the luxury Swiss watch brand extend its existing sponsorship of the season-ending ATP World Tour Finals at The O2 in London. Rolex has a long-standing relationship with tennis, sponsoring the sport’s leading tournaments, and counts 17-time grand slam champion Roger Federer among its family of testimonies.\n\nBoise bids for Davis Cup quarterfinal\n\nAccording to the Idaho Statesman, legendary Boise State University tennis coach Greg Patton is working with Idaho Tennis Association Executive Director Steve Bickham and local businesses to bid to the United States Tennis Association to host the U.S. Davis Cup quarterfinal from April 5-7 at the Taco Bell Arena.

This year, the overall prize money on the WTA Tour excluding Grand Slams will increase from $53.3 million in 2012 to $58.7 million. It is a 69 percent rise since the organization’s Road Map charter was put in place in 2009. The new events on the WTA Tour in 2013 will be in Katowice, Poland in April and in the Brazilian city of Florianopolis. In addition to the event in Bogota, Colombia, and Florianopolis, an International event will be relocated from Memphis in the United States to Rio de Janeiro. The 2014 calendar will also feature events relocating to China and Hong Kong. Wuhan, the hometown of current World No. 6 and 2011 French Open champion Li Na, will host a Premier 5 event the week prior to the China Open in Beijing. The tournament will feature at least seven of the year-end top 10-ranked players competing for more than $2 million in prize money and will replace the Toray Pan Pacific Open in Tokyo. Coupled with the relocation of an International event from Kuala Lumpur to Hong Kong in 2014, China will host five of the 18 events in the Asia-Pacific region. “We are excited by the growth of women’s professional tennis, particularly in key markets like China and Brazil,” said Stacey Allaster, WTA chairman and CEO. “Development in the BRIC markets, led by China, has been a strategic priority for the past several years. We look forward to continue strengthening of our global brand, developing our sport, and building our fan base worldwide.”\n\nPark advocates disagree with USTA expansion plan\n\nAccording to an article written by Clare Trapasso of the New York Daily News, Park advocates aren’t showing much love to a plan for a $500 million expansion of a premiere tennis center in Flushing Meadows-Corona Park, which plays host each summer to the US Open. Activists slammed a proposal last week that would allow the U.S. Tennis Association to use .68 acres of park land for the project and not replace it elsewhere. “Any time that we’re going to be taking away park land, park land replacement must be a priority,” said City Councilwoman Julissa Ferreras (D-East Elmhurst). “Green space is so limited in our community.” But USTA officials said the city Parks Department asked the association to pay for improvements in the park instead of replacing the small sliver of property. The city will choose the projects. The USTA submitted a proposal to the city last Monday to expand the Billie Jean King National Tennis Center, where the U.S. Open is held annually. It must undergo a city and public review process before the City Council can vote on whether to approve it.\n\nWilson launches new clay court tennis balls\n\nContinuing its leadership in the tennis ball category, Wilson Tennis (www.wilsontennis.com) expands its premium tennis ball position with new Tour Clay Red and Tour Clay Green tennis balls that feature Element Guard technology, developed to maximize performance and durability specific to red and green clay court surfaces.

Organizers of the US Open said they were moving the final to Monday to allow the two finalists a day off after their semifinal victories. Quoted in a USA Today article written by Douglas Robson, ATP board representative Justin Gimelstob said he and other ATP leaders were “frustrated” by the USTA’s announcement to extend the tournament to 15 days. Gimelstob also said, “It’s a tale of two very different interpretations. There are nine months to go, and many more chapters to be written.” USTA Spokesman Chris Widmaier said Tuesday that the decision to move the final to Monday should have surprised no one based on communication with the tour and players in recent months. “We understand their concerns,” Widmaier said. “We look forward to further discussions.” While many players were frustrated with the change, ATP executives and board members were stunned Andy Murray praised the changes. “I’m pleased that the USTA has modified the U.S. Open schedule to include a day of rest between the semifinals and final,” 2012 champion Murray said in the statement. “Together with the prize money increase, it’s good that they’ve taken on board the players’ concerns.”The ATP runs the men’s World Tour but not the four Grand Slams, and the organization said in a statement: “We strongly believe the US Open should keep a similar schedule to the other Grand Slams, with the men’s semi-finals completed by Friday and the final on Sunday. The ATP and its players have made it clear to the US Open that we do not support a Monday final (at Flushing Meadows). It is unfortunate the US Open response did not reflect our views on this issue and the ATP and its players will continue to pursue this matter in its discussions with the USTA.” The USTA has said the change is for the 2013 event only and that the matter would be reviewed after that.\n\nATP approves tournament in Bogotá in 2013\n\nThe ATP World Tour is set to return to Bogotá, Colombia, in 2013, following the ATP Board of Directors’ approval of the sale of the Los Angeles tournament, an ATP World Tour 250 event, to IMLA de Colombia, a Colombian entertainment and sports marketing company. The new tournament will be staged at the Centro de Alto Rendimiento in Bogotá, the same venue that hosted an ATP World Tour event from 1997–2002. Brad Drewett, ATP Executive Chairman & President, said, “The ATP World Tour is a truly global sports property, and demand for events around the world has never been greater. This latest transfer represents a fantastic opportunity for the ATP World Tour to continue to strengthen its presence in South America, a growing market for men’s professional tennis. The new tournament owners have a wealth of experience in tennis and we look forward to a successful event in Colombia. “I would also like to take this opportunity to thank Bob Kramer and his organizing team for their tireless work in running the ATP World Tour 250 event in Los Angeles over the years. Bob’s services to tennis have been hugely appreciated,” said Drewett. The Bogota event will take place on outdoor hard-court from July 15-21, 2013. In turn, the 2013 BB&T Atlanta Open will take place one week later, from July 22-28.\n\nMP & Silva adds ATP Kremlin Cup to its Tennis Portfolio\n\nMP & Silva, a leading international media rights company, has secured a worldwide rights distribution deal from 2014 to 2018 with the Kremlin Cup ATP World Tour 250 Series event.

It is the first time that an ATP executive has featured on the list and the Australian is the only tennis executive to make this year’s list. Recognizing Drewett for his work in securing a greater share of Grand Slam tournament revenue for players, the SBJ wrote that “Drewett took over the ATP in 2012… (and) already has won huge concessions from the Australian Open.”\n\nMadison Keys, Rhyne Williams Win Australian Open Wild Card Playoffs\n\nMadison Keys (Rock Island, Ill.) and Rhyne Williams (Knoxville, Tenn.) each earned wild card entries into the main draw of the 2013 Australian Open Sunday by winning the Australian Open Wild Card Playoffs at Life Time Athletic & Tennis at Peachtree Corners. Keys defeated Mallory Burdette (Jackson, Ga.), 7-5, 6-3, and Williams took down Tim Smyczek (Milwaukee), 7-6(4), 5-7, 6-3, 6-3, in Sunday’s indoor finals, each in a match format emulating the Grand Slam. The 17-year old Keys, seeded third, won the event for the second year in a row, becoming the first woman and second player overall, along with Ryan Harrison (2009-10), to do so in the tournament’s five-year history. “I’m pretty happy with how I’ve been doing and how I’ve been playing. Hopefully I can just really keep it up now,” said Keys, who fell to Jie Zheng in the first round of last January’s Australian Open, 6-2, 6-1. “It’d be great to go to Australia and not get killed in the first round this year. Hopefully that happens"
