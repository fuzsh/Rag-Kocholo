        "text": "By Randy Walker\n\n@TennisPublisher\n\nRoger Federer may head into the US Open with his lowest ranking since 2002 at No. 7, but the 17-time major singles champion is once again on the cusp of making more tennis history.\n\nJust by stepping onto the court for his first-round match against Grega Zemlja of Slovenia at the 2013 US Open, the 32-year-old Federer will add another record to his incredible tennis resume. The 2013 US Open will mark Federer’s 56th consecutive appearance in a major tournament, equaling the record men’s mark set by Wayne Ferreira, who played 56 major titles from the 1991 Australian Open to 2004 US Open.\n\n“Still here,” is what Federer said to reporters earlier this year in Australia when asked to discuss approaching Ferreira’s record, bringing up that he had actually ball-boyed for Ferreira, played doubles with him, but neglecting to bring up that he lost to the South Africa two of the three times they played on the ATP Tour.\n\n“Longevity has always been something that’s been important to me,” said Federer in January. “I’ve planned the season accordingly this year again, that I will not miss the majors because of injury. But then again sometimes you get hit with an unlucky injury just shortly before a Slam. There’s obviously nothing you can do about it. The best‑of‑five, the rule in tennis, it takes to get deep in a tournament, there’s no easy ways. I’m excited that I’ve played so many in a row and I hope I can keep the streak alive and see where it stops. We’ll see how it goes.”\n\nReporters informed Federer that Ferreira was surprised that his record was so soon to be broken and asked Federer for his reaction.\n\n“Yeah, I am, too,” he said. “It’s not something you really plan. You play when you’re ready. If you’re not, you’re not. When I was coming along, guys would not go to Australia. Like (Carlos) Moya wouldn’t play Wimbledon because he just thought, I’d rather take that time to get off and get ready for some more clay after Wimbledon. It was normal. I came through that period of times a well. But I felt my game suited all the service surfaces, so I thought, Might as well go to all the different tournaments. Next thing you know, we’re here talking about it. It wasn’t something that was planned in any way.”\n\nFerreira retired shortly after playing his 56th straight major at the 2004 US Open, just days before his 33rd birthday.\n\n“I feel good in the fact that I’ve been healthy through all of them,” said Ferreira in 2004 to reporters of his 56 straight majors. “I’ve had some good runs at it. My career has been long. I think maybe I would have changed it up a bit and played a little bit less and been more ready for the Grand Slams. I did come in here for a few of them tired and not prepared well enough for them. But, you know, I’ve competed well. I’ve always been in good shape and given my best here. I think, you know, I’ve had some really good chances to win the whole thing, and it hasn’t worked out. But I came in here thinking — every time I came in here thinking I could win the tournament.”\n\nAs documented in THE BUD COLLINS HISTORY OF TENNIS book (available here: http://www.newchaptermedia.com/the-bud-collins-history-of-tennis-an-authoritative-encyclopedia-and-record-book/), in women’s tennis, Ai Sugiyama of Japan owns the women’s – and all-time – record for most major singles titles played consecutively with 62 played from 1994 Wimbledon to the 2009 US Open.\n\nBy Liz Kobak\n\n@LizTennis\n\nNadal, Williams Win Emirates Airline US Open Series\n\nRafael Nadal clinched the 2013 Emirates Airline US Open Series men’s title on Monday after John Isner withdrew from the Winston-Salem Open due to hip injury. Only Isner could have potentially surpassed Nadal in points.\n\nThe World No. 2 accumulated 200 points after winning the 2013 Western & Southern Open and therefore competes for $3.6 Million at the 2013 US Open, the largest payout in tennis history.\n\nSerena Williams clinched the 2013 Emirates Airline US Open Series women’s title on Saturday after defeating China’s Li Na in the semifinals of the Western & Southern Open. The World No. 1 also vies for $3.6 million in potential US Open prize money, including $1 million in possible bonus prize money as Series and Open champion.\n\nThe Emirates Airline US Open Series Bonus Challenge produced some of tennis’ largest payouts for men (Roger Federer won $2.4 Million in 2007) and women (Kim Clijsters won $2.2 Million in 2005 and 2010).\n\nBartoli Retires, Shocks World\n\nWimbledon Champion Marion Bartoli surprised everyone when she announced her retirement from the WTA tour last Wednesday after losing in three sets during the Western & Southern Open to Romania’s Simona Halep.\n\n“Everyone will remember my Wimbledon title,” said tearful Bartoli during her press conference. “No one will remember the last match I played here.”\n\nPersonal sponsors may or may not pull out following this announcement, according to sports industry experts.\n\n“She might lose mid six figures from endorsers but also frees up time to do things off the court,” said Ben Sturner, CEO and Founder of sports marketing firm Leverage Agency. “[One] Wouldn’t see too many endorsers dropping her unless maybe it’s a tennis specific brand.”\n\n“I don’t think [Bartoli] is worried financially that it will affect her,” Sturner continued. “I won’t be surprised to see her in some exhibitions in the near future, especially in France.”\n\nBartoli won her first-ever Grand Slam six weeks prior without dropping one set. She became the first two-handed player on both sides to claim this title. Some wonder why Bartoli chose to compete in this event rather than retiring immediately following her Wimbledon victory. Her face still appears on a billboard outside of New Haven, where she was supposed to compete.\n\nMurray, Djokovic To Play at Madison Square Garden\n\nReigning Wimbledon Champion Andy Murray and World No. 1 Novak Djokovic are bringing their on-court rivalry to New York’s Madison Square Garden.\n\nTennis’ top dogs are playing two out of three sets on March 3, 2014 at the popular Metropolitan arena home to NBA’s Knicks and NHL’s Rangers.\n\nMurray and Djokovic have played each other in three of the last four Grand Slam finals, with Murray leading 2-1 in head to head. Murray aims to defend his US Open title, in which he beat Djokovic in five hard sets last year. Top-ranked Djokovic defeated Murray in January’s Australian Open final, while Murray won their Wimbledon title match last month in three convincing sets.\n\nTickets go on sale Nov. 4, 2013.\n\n“What Can Tennis Do To Improve Lives In Africa” Panel Set For Friday\n\nCredit Suisse is hosting a media panel discussion “What Can Tennis Do To Improve Lives In Africa” on Friday morning, August 23 at the Grand Hyatt Hotel in New York.

Newcomers Vasek Pospisil (CAN) and Pablo Carreno Busta (ESP) are also seeking success in Kuala Lumpur.\n\n“We are delighted that so many marquee names have decided to come to KL to celebrate our fifth birthday,” said Tournament Director Nick Freyer, of organisers IMG. “In addition to the previously announced top 10 marquee players, stars of the future and previous finalists, we now welcome additional top players.”\n\nLiz Kobak is a 2010 graduate of Columbia University and Northwestern University journalism master’s recipient. She is a former WTA ranked pro, #1 ranked United States junior tennis player who rates her 6-4, 6-1 win on Italian clay over Sara Errani as her best victory.\n\nFLUSHING, N.Y., August 15, 2013 – The USTA today announced its plans for a sweeping transformation of the USTA Billie Jean King National Tennis Center that will include building a retractable roof over Arthur Ashe Stadium, and the construction of two new stadiums. The transformation will be implemented in three phases to begin at the conclusion of the 2013 US Open, with the goal of overall completion by the 2018 US Open. The completion of the retractable roof for Arthur Ashe Stadium is scheduled for August 2017.\n\nThe cost for this historic transformation is estimated at $550 million, including the cost of the retractable roof, estimated to cost in excess of $100 million. As it has done with improvements to the National Tennis Center in the past, the USTA will self-finance the entire cost of this transformation through a combination of bonds and USTA revenue generation. Since 1994, the USTA has invested more than $500 million in improvements to the site.\n\n“We have been working toward a viable design for a roof on Arthur Ashe Stadium for more than a decade,” said USTA Chairman of the Board and President Dave Haggerty. “Through a long and arduous process, we feel that we now have a design that meets the criteria of being architecturally sound, aesthetically pleasing, reasonably affordable, and buildable.”\n\nIn addition to the roof on Arthur Ashe Stadium, phase one of construction is scheduled to include the shifting of the existing practice courts and two tournament courts to the north. This will allow the construction of an expanded viewing area for the practice courts and the three new tournament courts. This enhanced fan experience will require the re-building of the current transportation facilities located adjacent to Arthur Ashe Stadium.\n\nThe retractable roof is being designed by ROSSETTI, the designer and architect of Arthur Ashe Stadium. The USTA has hired Hunt Construction Group to build the retractable roof structure. Hunt has a long and impressive track record of sports facility construction in New York City, including construction of the Barclays Center and Citifield. As designed, the retractable roof constructed of flexible, translucent PTFE fabric stretched over a steel frame, will be supported by eight steel columns surrounding Arthur Ashe Stadium.\n\nPhase two of the transformation will be anchored by the construction of a new 8,000-seat Grandstand Stadium in the southwest quadrant of the Tennis Center. Simultaneously, field courts 7 through 16 will be moved south so that a larger pedestrian and fan esplanade can be created, better connecting the new Grandstand with Court 17. This southern expansion also allows the USTA to further enhance the fan experience, with a new additional food court, new merchandise locations and sponsor exhibit booths, and other fan amenities across the southern expanse of the Tennis Center.\n\nThe project’s final phase will include the construction of a new 15,000-seat Louis Armstrong Stadium. The USTA expects final design work for Armstrong to be completed in the next 12 to 18 months. The targeted completion date of the stadium, which will be built “roof-ready,” is August 2018. Also during the third phase, the USTA will complete a series of upgrades to the East Entrance, the most trafficked entry point to the US Open.\n\n“We have an aggressive construction agenda for the entire National Tennis Center, with a new Grandstand Court built in time for the 2015 US Open, new retractable roof over Arthur Ashe Stadium by 2017, and a new Louis Armstrong Stadium opening for the 2018 US Open,” said Gordon Smith, USTA Executive Director and Chief Operating Officer. “We recognize there are many known, and certainly many unknown, hurdles we will have to confront to meet this schedule. We are ready for the challenge and hope we can achieve it.”\n\nAs a direct result of these collective enhancements to the NTC, the facility will be able to accommodate an extra 10,000 people each day during the US Open, increasing attendance by approximately 100,000 new visitors, and amounting to a significant economic boost to Queens, New York City and the entire metropolitan region.\n\nBy Liz Kobak\n\n@LizTennis\n\nWTA Announces New Partnership with SAP\n\nThe WTA has announced a multi-year global sponsorship agreement with worldwide enterprise application software leader SAP.\n\nThrough the agreement, the WTA and SAP will collaborate to transform tennis, developing innovative solutions to further fan engagement, providing players with performance analyzing tools that optimize strategy and better service media. SAP is also now an official sponsor of the prestigious WTA Championships.\n\n“Through our cooperation with SAP, we aim to provide revolutionary analysis for our fans, players, coaches and media,” said WTA Chairman & CEO Stacey Allaster. “We are thrilled to be teaming with a global, innovative leader like SAP as international companies continue investing in women’s tennis.”\n\nThe SAP sponsorship announcement expands on the WTA’s continued business success off court with more than $200 million revenue generated for the organization since 2011. The WTA’s sponsorship portfolio continually grows with six new sponsors in the past three years, including signing global partner Xerox last February.\n\nHall of Fame Creating Enhanced Tennis Facility\n\nThe International Tennis Hall of Fame & Museum in Newport is adding new features to its illustrious roster: an extensive capital campaign in hopes of creating one cohesive campus and world-class tennis facility.\n\nThis will offer enhanced visitor experiences while supporting the organization’s goal of preserving tennis’ history and promoting the sport. Four primary campaign focus areas are: Upgrade the museum with new technology and enhanced exhibitions; create more tennis courts and facilities; improve campus-wide amenities including tennis stadium enhancements and overall strategic expansion of the Hall of Fame’s footprint.\n\n“The campaign for the International Tennis Hall of Fame & Museum will ensure that we can achieve our mission of preserving the history of tennis,” said Chairman of the International Tennis Hall of Fame & Museum Christopher Clouser, “That our facilities offer a world-class, one-of-a-kind experience for tennis enthusiasts, and that the property and our programs are a benefit to the local community.”\n\nThe campaign aims to allot $15.7 million toward renovation. In one year of fundraising, only $10,556,000 million has been raised according to the Board of Directors.\n\nAdidas Quarterly Sales Target Falls\n\nGerman sportswear group Adidas today cut its forecasted sales targets for 2013 on Thursday, blaming plummeting Q2 European sales and unfavorable currency impacts.\n\nAdidas reported €3.38 billion in Q2 sales, significantly lower than effective sales.

Prior to that, Pierce represented IMG for 27 years, leading its consulting division.\n\n“Andy is a trusted leader,” said a Lagardère spokesman. “His 30 years of experience in forming corporate partnerships and within the sports industry will enhance our existing business.”\n\nRising American Female Star Receiving Endorsements\n\nThe United States of America’s second highest ranked WTA female tennis player, Sloane Stephens, has lots to smile about in addition to her 2013 successes on court.\n\nThe 20-year-old American recently received endorsements from non-tennis brands, unusual especially for female athletes. American Express and Johnson & Johnson’s Listerine are giving Stephens $500,000 annually. UnderArmour is paying her $100,000 including bonuses and featuring her on billboards, where Stephens is the only female included in those advertisements.\n\n“American tennis has been dying for a new star,” said Stephen’s agent and Lagardère Unlimited’s Director of Tennis John Tobias.\n\nUnderArmour will raise Stephens’ endorsement pay to at least $750,000 annually should she continue excelling in tournaments.\n\nUSTA/NYJTL Announces Arthur Ashe Essay Contest Winners\n\nThe United States Tennis Association (USTA) named ten winners of the 15th Annual USTA/NJTL Arthur Ashe Essay Contest.

Very happy the way that I played almost every match in this tournament. Is very important for me, this title. Just very happy for everything.” – Rafael Nadal, after winning the Rogers Cup.\n\n“I said yesterday the only chance to win against Novak, the only tactic is to play very well. And I did. I played a very high level tonight, I think. I played with the right decisions in the important moments.” – Rafael Nadal, after beating Novak Djokovic 6-4 3-6 7-6 (2) in the Rogers Cup semifinals.\n\n“It was very close match. Whenever we play against each other, it’s always a thrilling match for the crowd to see. We are both competing at the high level. We both want to win these matches.” – Novak Djokovic, who now trails 21-15 in his career meetings against Rafael Nadal.\n\n“The goal is to try and peak at the US Open. – Andy Murray, after his shocking loss third round loss to Ernests Gulbis inMontreal.\n\n“When I lose a match I am always a little bit sad. But still have to find some positives. It is my first tournament afterWimbledon. I was doing a pretty good job, so I just continue for next month.” – Li Na, after losing her Rogers Cup semifinal to Sorana Cirstea 6-1 7-6 (5)\n\n“It was extremely hot out there and so tough to play, so I’m really happy I found the energy to win in the end. She was playing really well, and with the conditions, after the fourth game of the first set I was dead already. I’m sure in different conditions it would be a different game, but we both fought until the end and gave all our heart out there and I’m so happy to have won.” – Shahar Peer, following her triumph at the Suzhou Open, her first tournament title in four years.\n\nSPOILER\n\nMilos Raonic was trying to become the first Canadian to win the Rogers Cup in 55 years. Rafael Nadal made sure Canadawill wait at least one more year. The last Canadian to win what was then called the Canadian Open was Robert Bedard, who captured his country’s top tennis event in 1955. Now 81 years old, Bedard was among the crowd that watch Nadal win his third Rogers Cup title The Spanish star also won in 2005 and 2008. “I did a lot of things well,” Nadal said. “My return was huge this afternoon. I returned a few first serves of his in important moments, decisive. Then I think he play with more mistakes than usual. That helped me.” Playing his first tournament since suffering a first-round loss at Wimbledon, Nadal won his eighth title of the year and 58th of his career. By reaching the final, the 22-year-old Raonic will move up to 10th in the world rankings, the highest a Canadian man has ever been ranked. He also will be the youngest player in the top 10.\n\nSERENA AGAIN\n\nSerena Williams just keeps winning, which means she is steadily moving up in the records books. Her crushing victory over Sorana Cirstea in the Rogers Cup women’s final in Torontowas the 54th WTA singles title of Williams’ career.

Only Martina Navratilova, Chris Evert, Steffi Graf and Lindsay Davenport have won more WTA singles titles than Williams. “There’s a lot of pressure and nothing is guaranteed, but I’m happy to do well,” Williams told the crowd. The Romanian was appearing in only her third WTA final. The world’s top-ranked woman player, Williams had no problems with her Romanian foe, needing just over an hour to capture the Rogers Cup for the third time.\n\nSHAHAR STARS\n\nWhen Shahar Peer beat China’s Zheng Saisai in the final of the Suzhou Ladies Open, it was the Israeli’s first tournament title in four years. Once ranked as high as 11th in the world, Peer fell to 179th earlier this year. But she reached her first WTA-level final in two years last month inBaku,Azerbaijan, and has now been in the quarterfinals or higher in her last four tournaments, having won 11 of her last 14 matches and nine of her last 10. Although her victory inSuzhou,China, will put her back in the top 100 in the world, Peer will have to qualify to gain a spot in the main draw of the US Open later this month. She split with coach Pablo Giacopelli several weeks ago and decided to focus on gaining ranking points and confidence by playing smaller events inAsia. It’s a decision that is paying off forIsrael’s top female player.\n\nSLIPUP\n\nAndy Murray was hoping to get a lot of practice on hard courts in preparation for defending his US Open title.Latvia’s Ernests Gulbis made sureMurrayhad as little work as possible. Gulbis shocked the Rogers Cup crowd when he upsetMurray6-4 6-3 in a third-round match. “I was playing a very good player today, someone that gives you very little rhythm on the court,”Murray said. “But I actually thought I hit the ball better today than yesterday.” After winningWimbledon– and becoming the first British player to do so since Fred Perry in 1936. “I had a bit longer to prepare this year,”Murray noted. “But maybe I just need to make sure I get a few more matches in practice in the future.”\n\nSPECIAL FEELING\n\nNo surprise here. Serena Williams us the first player to qualify for this year’s TEB BNPParibas WTA Championships, which will be held in Istanbul, Turkey, from Oct. 22-27. The world’s top eight women singles players and top four doubles teams will compete for a record-setting USD $6 million in prize money. It is the third straight year the TEB BNPParibas WTA Championships have been held in Istanbul. The defending champion, Williams has now qualified for the season-ending championships 10 times in her career and is a three-time champion, having also won in 2001 and 2009. She also reached the final in 2002 and 2004. This season Williams has amassed an impressive 51-3 record, and her titles include Roland Garros, her 16th career Grand Slam tournament singles title.\n\nSUPER HOT SORANA\n\nIt was a remarkable week for Sorana Cirstea. Playing in the Rogers Cup in Toronto, the unseeded Romanian battled into the final after posting victories over former world number ones Carolina Wozniacki and Jelena Jankovic, defending champion Petra Kvitova and 2011 French Open winner Li Na. “I am really excited for what’s happened this week,” Cirstea said. “Everything now is coming together for me.” The Romanian’s lone singles title came five years ago atTashkent.\n\nSTRIKE\n\nMardy Fish took time from practicing so he could indulge in another of his favorite sports. The American threw out the first pitch before the San Diego Padres took on the Cincinnati Reds in a baseball game. “I played a lot of sports growing up. I played a little baseball until I was 14 or so,” Fish said. “I was born in Minnesota so I’m a huge Twins fan. I know a couple of guys on the team, so I root for them.” Fish was inCincinnatipreparing for this week’s Western & Southern Open. Fish was a finalist in Cincinnati in 2003 to Andy Roddick and in 2010 to Roger Federer.\n\nSISTERLY PAYBACK\n\nDon’t blame Kirsten Flipkens if she feels a little shell-shocked. The Belgian lost the opening set 6-0, and then rallied to upset Venus Williams at the Rogers Cup inToronto. By the luck of the draw, Fipkens had to play Venus’ little sister, Serena, later in the tournament. Serena Williams was ready for the challenge. “After I won the first set (6-0) I definitely thought about Venus, and I thought about what a good comeback Kirsten had, so I thought, ‘I’m not going to get overconfident.’ She’s obviously a really good player, so I was just trying to stay really focused as well as really intense at that moment.” Serena won 6-0 6-3.\n\nSTRAIGHT IN\n\nBradley Klahn earned a wild card entry into the main draw of the US Open men’s singles, then captured the Comerica Challenger in Aptos,California,USA. The 22-year-old American reached the final in Binghamton,New York,USA, where he fell to Alex Kuznetsov. While at Stanford University, Klahn won the 2010 NCAA men’ singles title and was a four-year All-American. He clinched the wild card awarded to the American man who earns the most ranking points in two of four USTA Pro Circuit hard-court events, which includes a USD $100,000 event in Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada, and a USD $50,000 tournament in Lexington, Kentucky, USA. Klahn received a wild card into the US Open qualifying last year. He won three matches, advancing to the main draw, where he upset fellow left-hander Jurgen Melzer in a five-set first round.\n\nShelby Rogers earned the women’s 2013 US Open wild card.\n\nCollin Altamirano and Sachia Vickery won the USTA Boys’ and Girls’ 18s National Championships singles titles, earning each a wild card into the main draw of the US Open. The 17-year-old Altamirano became the first unseeded player ever to win the USTA Boys’ 18s singles in the tournament’s 71 years. Vickery, 18, is 230th in the WTA rankings.\n\nSTICKING TOGETHER\n\nMartina Hingis credits her doubles partner for bringing her back into the game. The Swiss star was inducted into the International Tennis Hall of Fame last month. Then she immediately signed up to play doubles on the WTA tour with Daniela Hantuchova. Hingis said it was Hantuchova who convinced her to play again. “When I was coaching Anastasia Pavlyuchenkova, that’s when Daniela approached me and said, ‘Don’t you thing it would be great to play doubles? You’ve still got it.’” The two lost in the second round at the Rogers Cup inToronto, but they are entered into this week’s tournament inCincinnati,Ohio,USA, and at the US Open. Hingis teamed with Jana Novotna to win the US Open doubles in 1998.\n\nSELES HONORED\n\nMonica Seles, a two-time US Open champion, has been named the 2013 inductee into the US Open Court of Champions. Seles will be inducted during an on-court ceremony in Arthur Ashe Stadium prior to the women’s singles final on Sunday, September 8. The US Open Court of Champions salutes the tournament’s all-time greatest champions with an individual permanent monument that serves as a lasting tribute. Prior inductees include Andre Agassi, Arthur Ashe, Don Budge, Maureen Connolly, Jimmy Connors,Margaret Court, Chris Evert, Althea Gibson, Richard “Pancho” Gonzalez, Steffi Graf, Billie Jean King, Jack Kramer, Rod Laver, Ivan Lendl, Molla Bjurstedt Mallory, John McEnroe, Martina Navratilova, Margaret Osborne DuPont, Ken Rosewall, Pete Sampras, Bill Tilden and Helen Wills.\n\nSALUTED\n\nAlan Hassenfeld, a member of the International Tennis Hall of Fame (ITHoF) board, has been awarded the prestigious Chairman’s Award. Christopher E. Clouser, chairman of the ITHoF, made the presentation at the tennis shrine in Newport,Rhode Island,USA. The former chairman of the board and present chairman of the executive committee of Hasbro, Inc., an international toy company, Hassenfeld has taken an active leadership role in ITHoF affairs, serving on both the Development Committee and the Capital Campaign.\n\nSAD NEWS\n\nEiichi Kawatei of Japan is dead at the age of 79. Kawatei was a leader in the development and promotion of tennis inAsiaand worldwide for more than 40 years. He was highly active with the International Tennis Federation (ITF) for more than 30 years, serving as a member of the Committee of Management, member of the ITF Board of Directors, Vice President, Chairman of the Junior Competitions Committee and Honorary Life Vice President. He also was a Technical Delegate for the Olympic Tennis Event each year since the sport’s return to the Games in 1988.\n\nSHARED PERFORMANCES\n\nAptos: Jonathan Erlich and Andy Ram beat Chris Cuccione and Matt Reid 6-3 6-7 (6) 10-2 (match tiebreak)\n\nMontreal: Alexander Peya and Bruno Soares beat Colin Fleming and Andy Murray 6-4 7-6 (4)\n\nSuzhou: Timeo Babos and Michaella Krajicek beat Han Xinyun and Eri Hozumi 6-2 6-2\n\nToronto: Jelena Jankovic and Katarina Srebotnik beat Anna-Lena Groenefeld and Kveta Peschke 5-7 6-2 10-6 (match tiebreak)\n\nSURFING\n\nCincinnati: www.cincytennis.com/\n\nWinston-Salem: www.winstonsalemopen.com/?\n\nNew Haven: www.newhavenopen.com/\n\nTOURNAMENTS THIS WEEK\n\n(All money in USD)\n\nMEN\n\n$3,079,555 Western & Southern Open,Cincinnati,Ohio,USA, hard\n\nWOMEN\n\n$2,369,000 Western & Southern Open,Cincinnati,Ohio,USA, hard\n\nTOURNAMENTS NEXT WEEK\n\nMEN\n\n$625,000 Winston Salem Open atWakeForest, Winston Salem, North Carolina, USA, hard\n\nWOMEN\n\n$637,000 New Haven Open at Yale,New Haven,Connecticut,USA, hard\n\nBy Bob Greene\n\n15 July 2013\n\nSTARS\n\nCarlos Berlocq beat Fernando Verdasco 7-5 6-1 to win the SkiStar Swedish Open inBåstad,Sweden\n\nFabio Fognini beat Philipp Kohlschreiber 57 6-4 6-4 to win the Mercedes Cup inStuttgart,Germany\n\nNicolas Mahut beat Lleyton Hewitt 5-7 7-5 6-3 to win the Hall of Fame Tennis Championships inNewport,Rhode Island,USA\n\nRoberta Vinci beat Sara Errani 6-3 3-6 6-3 to win the XXVI Italiacom Open inPalermo,Italy\n\nSimona Halep beat Yvonne Meusburger 6-3 6-7 (7) 6-1 to win the Budapest Grand Prix inBudapest,Hungary\n\nSAYING\n\n“I would like to tell you I’m not tired. I’m tired, but I have the trophy in my bag.” – Nicolas Mahut, who won two matches on the last day to capture the rain-delayed Hall of Fame Tennis Championships.\n\n“If I could’ve had a day off and come back and played the final, I reckon things would’ve been different. All in all, it was a good week.” – Lleyton Hewitt, noting the semifinals and final were played on the same day because of rain delays.\n\n“I was probably eventually going to lose this tournament. It just happened a little earlier than I thought or wanted.” – John Isner, the two-time defending champion after losing to Lleyton Hewitt in the semifinals at Newport, Rhode Island, USA.\n\n“A month ago I was playing to make the cut for the qualies (qualifying) at the US Open, I was (ranked) 240 with some points to defend. I told my coach, I have to play great on grass to make the cut for the qualies. A month later I have two titles.” – Nicolas Mahut.\n\n“You have to be patient to get a title. I think the key was the mind-set I had from the first to the last match. Mental toughness was the key.” – Carlos Berlocq, following his SkiStar Swedish Open victory.\n\n“I played an unbelievable match today. I knew I had to – Sara is an unbelievable player.” – Roberta Vinci, after beating her doubles partner, Sara Errani, in the Palermo,Sicily, final.\n\n“It’s a fantastic feeling to win my third WTA title of the year. I just believed in my chances and I’ve taken them. I’m really enjoying my game right now. I hope that I can keep winning.” – Simona Halep, following her win in Budapest,Hungary.\n\n“At the end she was just better and she really deserved to win the title today. I’m still happy because I played a really good tournament. I’m only taking positive things with me from here.” – Yvonne Meusburger, after losing the Budapest final.\n\n“The players from that time on were consulted. It wasn’t about money.” – Cliff Drysdale, remembering what the male players won by boycotting Wimbledon in 1973.\n\n“Myself and (Ilie) Nastase were the only two privileged Romanians.” – Ion Tiriac, noting by playing tennis they were able to travel abroad learn about the rest of the world and what was going on.\n\n“There was no greater fighter who ever lived who played this game.” – Charlie Pasarell, recalling Pancho Gonzalez, who beat Pasarell in the longest match ever played on Wimbledon’s Centre Court.\n\n“That was the only time I was nervous.” – Martina Hingis, recalling the 1997 US Open when she beat 17-year-old Venus Williams.\n\n“I never lost an election. Whatever I was a candidate for, I won it.” – Ion Tiriac, when asked how it felt to be elected into the International Tennis Hall of Fame.\n\n“It’s the ultimate honor. I’m proud not just for me but for my family.” – Charlie Pasarell, when asked about being inducted into the International Tennis Hall of Fame.\n\n“I did a lot of different sports, but tennis was always a priority.” – Martina Hingis.\n\n“In three finals of Davis Cup he beat me three times.” – Ion Tiriac, talking about Stan Smith, a Hall of Famer who is now president of the International Tennis Hall of Fame.\n\n“How does it feel to have talked your way into the Hall of Fame.” – Mike Szostak, a reporter for the Providence Journal, to Cliff Drysdale, a former top-10 player who was inducted into the International Tennis Hall of Fame as a broadcaster.\n\nSHORT, PERHAPS, BUT OH SO SWEET\n\nTwo matches in one day? So what! After all, it was Nicolas Mahut on the court, someone who knows a little something about persevering in tennis. “You know I can play a long time. I can stay a long time on the court,” said Mahut. How right he is. The 31 year-old Frenchman lost the longest match in tennis history, dropping the fifth set to John Isner 70-68 at Wimbledon three years ago in a match that lasted 11 hours, 5 minutes. To capture the rain-delayed Hall of Fame Tennis Championships inNewport,Rhode Island,USA, all Mahut had to do was win two matches that couldn’t last more than six sets. That’s the rule. He took 63 minutes to beat Michael Russell 6-2 6-2 in the semifinals, then needed 2 hours, 19 minutes, to outlast former world number one Lleyton Hewitt 5-7 7-5 6-3 and win his second career title in two months. Not bad for a guy who needed help to even play the tournament. “I was not supposed to play,” Mahut said of gaining a wild-card entry into the tournament. “I wasn’t able to play the (qualifiers). I’m really grateful to (the tourney director) for the wild card he gave me.” Hewitt was one game away from winning, leading 5-3 in the second set, when Mahut began his championship run.\n\nIn his semifinal, Hewitt ousted two-time defending champion John Isner 5-7 6-2 6-4. The loss ended Isner’s 13 straight match wins in Newport. Last year, Isner had beaten Hewitt in the Hall of Fame Championships final. “It was a long battle this morning,” Hewitt said.\n\n“It was tough on both of us. In the end, I got the better of John.”\n\nMahut made the tournament doubly sweet when, on Monday, he teamed with fellow Frenchman Edouard Roger-Vasselin to capture the doubles, defeating the American pair of Tim Smyczek and Rhyne Williams 6-7 (4) 6-2 10-5 (match tiebreak).\n\nSWISS HALL OF FAMER\n\nSwitzerland’s Martina Hingis led the class of 2013 inductees into the International Tennis Hall of Fame (ITHoF) in ceremonies at the shrine in Newport,Rhode Island,USA. The 32-year-old was the fourth youngest player to be inducted, following Tracy Austin (30), Bjorn Borg (31) and Hana Mandlikova (32). “Thank you, tennis, you gave me the world,” Hingis told the crowd. “You chose to give me a place here for eternity.” Stan Smith, a Hall of Famer himself who is now president of ITHoF, said: “Having achieved world number one status in both singles and doubles and having won an incredible 15 Grand Slam tournament titles, Martina Hingis is undoubtedly one of the world’s elite players and we are glad to pay tribute to her among the legends of the sport.” Also enshrined were 94-year-old Thelma Coyne Long ofAustralia, who was inducted in the master player category, and Ion Tiriac, Cliff Drysdale and Charlie Pasarell, who were inducted for their contributions to tennis. Another Hall of Famer, Rod Laver, accepted the award for Long, who is currently living inSydney,Australia.\n\nSUCCESS, FINALLY\n\nItaly’s Fabio Fognini finally walked away a winner. The tournament’s fifth seed won the Mercedes Cup in Stuttgart,Germany, besting Philipp Kohlschreiber in the title match. It was the third time Fognini had been in an ATP World Tour final, losing his first two times last year, and had never beaten Kohlschreiber in two previous career meetings. Trying to win the tournament in his home country, Kohlschreiber saved four set points in the eighth game of the second set before Fognini pulled even at one set apiece. Fognini took a 4-1 lead in the final set before becoming the first Italian to capture the clay court event in Stuttgart.\n\nSWEET SWEDEN\n\nCall Carlos Berlocq a champion – finally. Playing in his second ATP World Tour final, Berlocq finally walked away with the winner’s trophy, beating eighth-seeded Fernando Verdasco. The 30-year-old Berlocq broke the Spaniard’s serve twice in the second set after capturing a grueling opening set that lasted more than an hour. The Argentine’s only other trip to a final came in February 2012 when he lost to Juan Monaco at the VTROpen.\n\nSTRAINED RELATIONS?\n\nThe finalists at the Italiacom Open know each other quite well. Roberta Vinci and Sara Errani are the WTA’s top-ranked doubles team and are close friends. And when the two usually face each other, it is Errani who emerges the winner. Not this time, however. In the battle of Italians, Vinci lost her serve in the opening game, then broke back twice to earn the opening set. It was all Errani, who won the Palermo,Sicily, tournament in 2008 and 2012, in the second set as she raced out to a 5-1 lead. In the decisive third set, Vinci turned the tables, taking a 4-0 lead, and then held off her sixth-ranked friend to gain her ninth career victory. Vinci’s victory ends a streak of five straight losses to Errani. “I live here and practice here at this club, so winning here is fantastic for me,” Vinci said. “I really didn’t expect to win this tournament, especially with Sara in the final, but I played a really good match. I’ll probably stay five or six days at home now, and then I’m starting my hard court season in Carlsbad(California,USA).”\n\nSTREAKING SIMONA\n\nSimona Halep won her third WTA tournament in five weeks by defeating Yvonne Meusburger in the final of the Hungarian Grand Prix. The 21-year-old Romanian, who has a 16-1 won-loss record since the French Open, also captured titlesNuremberg,Germany, andRosmalen,Netherlands. Halep had sailed through the week without dropping a set and appeared to be on her way to a straight-set victory in the final. She built a 6-3 lead in the second-set tiebreaker, giving her triple match point. But Meusburger won eight of the next 10 points to send the match into a third set. Halep took back control to join Virginia Ruzici, Irina Spirlea and Ruxandra Dragomir Ilie as the only Romanian players to win three or more WTA titles.\n\nSHARAPOVA & JIMBO\n\nMaria Sharapova has a new coach. Hoping to stem her disappointing season, the Russian dropped Thomas Hogstedt, her coach of three years, and hired Jimmy Connors, the eight-time Grand Slam tournament champion and former coach of Andy Roddick. Sharapova and Connors have worked together for short stints in the past, but never on a full-time basis. “I am happy to announce that Jimmy Connors will be my new coach,” the 26-year-old Russian announced on her website. “I have known Jimmy for many years and we briefly worked together in 2008 just before the Australian Open. I am really excited about our new partnership and looking forward to the upcoming tournaments.” Sharapova lost in the semifinals of the Australian Open to Li Na, reached the French Open final as defending champion, only to lose to Serena Williams, and then was upset in the second round at Wimbledon by Michelle Larcher de Brito. That was the earlier Sharapova had been eliminated at the grass court major since 2009.\n\nSTREAK IS OVER\n\nThe Texas Wild ended the longest winning streak in major United States pro sports history by defeating the Washington Kastles in World Team Tennis. Eugenie Bouchard beat Anastasia Rodionova in the decisive match, giving the Wild a 23-18 win. That came a day after the Kastles bested the mark of 33 set by the National Basketball Association’s Los Angeles Lakers in the 1971-72 season. Before falling to the Wild, the Kastles had not lost in the summer league sinceJuly 22, 2010.\n\nSARDINIA SITE\n\nThe Fed Cup final between Italy and Russia will be played on clay inCagliari,Sardinia. The event will be held November 2-3 at the Tennis Club Cagliari. Between them, since 2000ItalyandRussiahave won seven Fed Cup titles – the Italians capturing the women’s team title in 2006, 2009 and 2010, while the Russians were victorious in 2004, 2005, 2007 and 2008. In the 2007 Fed Cup final,RussiabeatItaly4-0 on a hard court in Moscow.\n\nSCANDAL\n\nA Catholic youth movement in Poland has dropped Agnieszka Radwanska for appearing nude in the “Body Issue” of ESPN Magazine. While not explicit, the photo shows the naked 24-year-old Radwanska sitting in a lawn chair by a pool filled with tennis balls. The group, known as Krucjata Mlodych (Youth Crusade), runs a campaign dubbed “I’m not ashamed of Jesus.” It dropped the world’s fourth-ranked player for what they said was “immoral behavior.” Radwanska had appeared in a television commercial sponsored by the group in which she spelled out the word “Jesus” with tennis balls and urged young Poles not to be ashamed of their faith.\n\nSHARED PERFORMANCES\n\nBåstad: Nicholas Monroe and Simon Stadler beat Carlos Berlocq and Albert Ramos 6-3 3-6 10-3 (match tiebreak)\n\nBudapest: Andrea Hlavackova and Lucie Hradecka beat Nina Bratchikova and Anna Tatishvilli 6-4 6-1\n\nNewport: Nicolas Mahut and Edouard Roger-Vasselin beat Tim Smyczek and Rhyne Williams 6-7 (4) 6-2 10-5 (match tiebreak)\n\nPalermo: Kristina Mladenovic and Katarzyna Piter beat Karolina Pliskova and Kristyna Pliskova 6-1 5-7 10-8 (match tiebreak)\n\nStuttgart: Facundo Bagnis and Thomaz Bellucci beat Tomasz Bednarek and Mateusz Kowalczyk 2-6 6-4 11-9 (match tiebreak)\n\nSURFING\n\nHamburg: http://bet-at-home-open.com/\n\nBåstad (women): www.swedishopen.org/\n\nBad Gastein: www.gastein-ladies.at\n\nBaku: http://bakucup.az/\n\nStanford: www.bankofthewestclassic.com/\n\nAtlanta: www.bbtatlantaopen.com\n\nGstaad: www.creditagricolesuisseopengstaad.ch/\n\nUmag: www.croatiaopen.hr\n\nAstana: http://tennis.wettpoint.com\n\nTOURNAMENTS THIS WEEK\n\n(All money in USD)\n\nMEN\n\n$1,413,538 bet-at-home Open – German Tennis Championships,Hamburg,Germany, clay\n\n$638,085 Claro Open Colombia,Bogotá,Colombia, hard\n\nWOMEN\n\n$235,000 Collector Swedish Open,Båstad,Sweden, clay\n\n$235,000 Nürnberger Gastein Ladies, BadGastein,Austria\n\nTOURNAMENTS NEXT WEEK\n\nMEN\n\n$546,930 BB&T Atlanta Open,Atlanta,Georgia,USA, hard\n\n$535,623 Crédit Agricole Suisse Open,Gstaad,Switzerland, clay\n\n$535,623 Vegeta Croatia Open,Umag,Croatia, clay\n\n$125,000 Presidents Cup,Astana,Kazakhstan, hard\n\nWOMEN\n\n$795,707 Bank of the West Classic,Stanford,California,USA, hard\n\n$235,000 Baku Cup,Baku,Azerbaijan, hard\n\nBy Bob Greene\n\nSTARS\n\nWimbledon\n\nMen’s Singles: Andy Murray beat Novak Djokovic 6-4 7-5 6-4\n\nWomen’s Singles: Marion Bartoli beat Sabine Lisicki 6-1 6-4\n\nMen’s Doubles: Bob Bryan and Mike Bryan beat Ivan Dodig and Marcelo Melo 3-6 6-3 6-4 6-4\n\nWomen’s Doubles: Hsieh Su-wei and Peng Shuai beat Ashleigh Barty and Casey Dellacqua 7-6 (1) 6-1\n\nMixed Doubles: Daniel Nestor and Kristina Mladenovic beat Bruno Soares and Lisa Raymond 5-7 6-2 8-6\n\nJunior Boys Singles: Gianluigi Quinzi beat Chung Hyeon 7-5 7-6 (2)\n\nJunior Girls Singles: Belinda Bencic beat Taylor Townsend 4-6 6-1 6-4\n\nJunior Boys Doubles: Thanasi Kokkinakis and Nick Kyrgios beat Enzo Couacaud and Stefano Napolitano 6-2 6-3\n\nJunior Girls Doubles: Barbora Krejcikova and Katerina Siniakova beat Anhelina Kalinina and Iryna Shymanovich 6-3 6-1\n\nMen’s Wheelchair Doubles: Stephane Houdet and Shingo Kunieda beat Frederic Cattaneo and Ronald Vink 6-4 6-2\n\nWomen’s Wheelchair Doubles: Jiske Griffioen and Aniek Van Koot beat Yui Kamiji and Jordanne Whiley 6-4 7-6 (6)\n\nOTHER\n\nFlorian Mayer beat Jiri Vesely 4-6 6-2 6-1 to win the Sparkassen Open inBraunschweig,Germany\n\nSAYING\n\n“Winning Wimbledon, I think, is the pinnacle of tennis. I still can’t believe it. Can’t get my head around that. I can’t believe it. This one will take a little while to sink in, I’m sure.” – Andy Murray, after becoming the first British man to win the Wimbledon singles in 77 years.\n\n“It was the finals of Wimbledon, so I cannot be too disappointed with my overall performance in the whole tournament. It was a great tournament for me. I could have done better today, but that’s sport. What doesn’t kill you makes you stronger, I guess. I need to have that kind of mentality and move on.” – Novak Djokovic, after losing the Wimbledon final to Andy Murray.\n\n“When I saw the packed stadium and the beautiful sky, I was like, ‘Gosh, this is going to be a great moment.’ And it was a great moment, trust me.” – Marion Bartoli, after winning the women’s singles title.\n\n“Everything now feels like a bonus. It just feels like we’re adding nuts and whipped cream and cherries to our great career.” – Bob Bryan, who with twin brother Mike became the first doubles team to be the reigning champion at all four Grand Slam tournaments at the same time.\n\n“I didn’t think anything could feel as sweet as the (Olympic) gold medal, but this one just feels like there’s a cap, a lid, or a ribbon around our career. It’s pretty cool. It’s something we never dreamed of, to try to win four in a row.” – Mike Bryan.\n\n“That last game will be the toughest game I’ll play in my career. Ever.” – Andy Murray, about a game in which he lost his first three match points before winning Wimbledon after the fourth deuce.\n\n“I’ve dreamed about this moment for so long. For me, winning Wimbledonis beyond my wildest dreams, let alone with an ace – but I’ve been practicing my serve for so long, I guess I saved it for the best moment. … This has been my dream since I was six years old.” – Marion Bartoli.\n\n“I’ve played my best tennis here. I took out the champion and runner-up from last year. That’s pretty big. This tournament definitely made me a better player. It was hard today but the experience will help me in the future. I still believe I can be champion one day.” – Sabine Lisicki, following her loss to Marion Bartoli in the women’s final.\n\n“I like playing with girls that hit big and are aggressive because I’m pretty slow. I’m not going to be the one covering more than half the court, which happens sometimes in mixed doubles. I’m fortunate to play with someone that can more than do her share. She’s a great player.” – Daniel Nestor, who teamed with Kristina Mladenovic to win the mixed doubles.\n\n“You know everything is starting to get empty in the locker room. It is, you know, a completely different feeling.” – Sabine Lisicki, on being in the quarterfinals at Wimbledon.\n\n“It’s another good thing for the country. We had the London Olympics, we have a royal baby coming soon, and a win like this keeps us on a roll when times are hard.” – Graham Bredber, a 47-year-old railway worker cheering on Andy Murray’s victory.\n\nSEVENTY-SEVEN YEAR DROUGHT ENDS\n\nAndy Murray broke the curse and became Great Britain’s first Wimbledon men’s singles champion since Fred Perry won the title in 1936. And Murraydid it by sweeping past the world’s top-ranked player, Novak Djokovic, in straight sets. “It’s hard. It’s really hard,”Murray said. “You know, for the last four or five years it’s been very, very tough, very stressful. It’s just kind of everywhere you go. It’s so hard to avoid everything because of how big this event is, but also because of the history and no Brit having won.” Not true any more. And Murray did it by rallying in both the second and third sets. He trailed 4-1 in the second set and 4-2 in the third. Each time, he fought back to take the lead. In the third set – the final one as it turned out –Murray won the last four games to end the 77-year-old chase. Even then it wasn’t easy. He won the first three points and had triple match point. Djokovic pulled to deuce. “I started to feel nervous and started thinking about what just happened,”Murray said. “There’s a lot of things you’re thinking of at that moment.” Eight points later the long wait was over. Britain had its own Wimbledon champion, and his name was Andy Murray.\n\nQueen Elizabeth reportedly joined in the celebration of Murray’s triumph, apparently sending him a private congratulatory message. Watching the victory from Centre Court’s royal box was British Prime Minister David Cameron. “It was an amazing performance from Andy Murray but also an amazing day for British tennis and for Britain,” Cameron said. “He never gave up and it was magnificent.”\n\nMissing from the royal box was the Duchess of Cambridge, Kate Middleton, a tennis fan who watched Murray last year but is due to give birth to the future heir to the British throne.\n\nSECOND TIME A CHARM\n\nMarion Bartoli’s second trip to the Wimbledonwomen’s singles final wound up with the big trophy. The Frenchwoman completed her run to the title by besting giant-killer Sabine Lisicki 6-1 6-4. Seeded 15th, Bartoli became the 42nd different player to win a Grand Slam tournament title in the Open Era, and the 18th different player to capture the women’s singles at Wimbledon. She is just the sixth player since 1968 to win the title without dropping a set, joining Martina Navratilova, Serena Williams, Venus Williams, Lindsay Davenport and Chris Evert. Bartoli’s first major title came in her 47th Grand Slam tournament appearance, the most by a woman before winning. Jana Novotna won Wimbledon in 1998 in her 45th appearance at a major. While Bartoli had a relatively easy run to the final, Lisicki knocked off defending champion and top-ranked Serena Williams, last year’s Wimbledon finalist and fourth-ranked Agnieszka Radwanska, 2011 US Open champion Samantha Stosur and 2010 French Open winner Francesca Schiavone. “Having so many hard matches is draining in the end of the day,” Lisicki said. “I think Marion was fresher today. I think that made a big difference too.” Bartoli lost the Wimbledon final in 2007 to Venus Williams in her only other trip to a major title match. It was Lisicki’s first Grand Slam tournament final. “I will learn and take away so much from it,” Lisicki said. “I’ve done that in the past. Experience has always helped me so much.”\n\nSIGNAL ACHIEVEMENT\n\nHsieh Su-wei became the first player from Taiwan to win a Grand Slam tournament title when she teamed with China’s Peng Shuai to capture the women’s doubles, besting Australia’s Ashleigh Barty and Casey Dellacqua. Peng is the third Chinese to win a Grand Slam doubles title. Hsieh and Peng have now won six WTA titles as a team. At Wimbledon, they were seeded eighth. Their Australian opponents were seeded 12th. It was the third time Dellacqua has finished runner-up in a women’s doubles final at a Grand Slam event. However, she did win the 2011 French Open mixed doubles title with American Scott Lipsky.\n\nSEMIFINAL STRUGGLE\n\nIn a titanic semifinal struggle that many consider the best match of the tournament, top-seeded Novak Djokovic survived against Juan Martin del Potro 7-5 4-6 7-6 (2) 6-7 (6) 6-3. Even Djokovic was impressed. “It was one of the best matches I’ve been a part of, one of the most exciting,” the relieved winner said. “It was so close.” The battle lasted four hours, 43 minutes, the longest semifinal inWimbledonhistory. “I could not separate us, apart from when I was 2-1 up and a break up, and I dropped serve,” said Djokovic. “That’s why he’s a Grand Slam champion. He came up with some top shots … credit to him.” Del Potro’s long Grand Slam tournament title came at the US Open in 2009 before injuries sidelined the Argentine.\n\nSTREAKING\n\nThe latest triumph by twin brothers Bob and Mike Bryan means they are the reigning champions of all four Grand Slam tournaments, a feat being dubbed the “Golden Bryan Slam.” They also won last year’s London Olympic doubles gold medal on the grass at Wimbledon. “It’s hard to even dream that we’d have the Slam, all four at one time,” said Mike. “It all started back after we won the gold. It just felt like a huge pressure was released. Went on to win the (US) Open and had a great summer. This year we’ve been on an amazing year. Never had a streak like this. Especially at 35, I feel like we’re hitting our peak.” The 35-year-old Americans lost the first five games of the match before finding their game. The victory raised their career total to 91 doubles titles. “Now we got to try to suit back up for the calendar slam,” Mike said, referring to the US Open, the final major of the year. “I don’t even want to think about that.” Ken McGregor and Frank Sedgman are the only men’s doubles team to have held all four titles at once, winning seven successive majors from the 1951 Australian Open to Wimbledon in 1952.\n\nSTAYING HOME\n\nThe back injury that kept Venus Williams out of Wimbledon is also causing her to pull out of World TeamTennis matches this week. The seven-time Grand Slam tournament winner has not played since suffering a first-round loss at the French Open in May. When she withdrew from Wimbledon, it ended the 33-year-old’s streak that had begun with her debut on the grass courts of the All England Lawn Tennis and Croquet Club in 1997. The 33-year-old American had played at Wimbledon every year since making her debut there in 1997. The Kastles, who began this week on a 32-match winning streak, said Martina Hingis would replace Williams.\n\nSWISS OPEN SPOT\n\nRoger Federer is returning to his roots. Following his stunning second-round loss on the grass courts at Wimbledon, Federer will play the clay-court Swiss Open in Gstaad, where he debuted when he was 16 years old. On his Twitter account, Federer wrote that Gstaad “gave me my first wild card in ’98.” He was the Wimbledon junior champion, but lost in straight sets to Lucas Arnold Ker of Argentina. Federer won the Gstaad title in 2004.\n\nSTRANGE\n\nPlaying in a USD $50,000 Challenger tournament in Winnetka,Illinois,USA, top-seeded Alex Bogomolov Jr. retired from his semifinal match when he disagreed with a line call. Serving in the third set, Bogomolov and his opponent, eighth-seeded American Bradley Klahn, were in a baseline rally when Bogomolov appeared to let up on a shot at his feet, believing it was long. The chair umpire told Bogomolov the ball was good and that the lines person saw it the same way. Bogomolov extended his hand to the umpire and conceded the match, losing 4-6 6-4 3-1.\n\nSHARED PERFORMANCES\n\nBraunschweig: Tomasz Bednarek and Mateusz Kowalczyk beat Andreas Siljestrom and Igor Zelenay 6-2 7-6 (4)\n\nSURFING\n\nBåstad (men): http://men.swedishopen.org\n\nStuttgart: www.mercedescup.de/\n\nNewport: www.halloffametennischampionships.com/\n\nBudapest: www.hungariangp.hu\n\nHamburg: http://bet-at-home-open.com/\n\nBåstad (women): www.swedishopen.org/\n\nBad Gastein: www.gastein-ladies.at\n\nTOURNAMENTS THIS WEEK\n\n(All money in USD)\n\nMEN\n\n$564,440 SkiStar Swedish Open,Båstad,Sweden, clay\n\n$533,785 Mercedes Cup,Stuttgart,Germany, clay\n\n$455,775 Hall of Fame Tennis Championships,Newport,Rhode Island,USA, grass\n\nWOMEN\n\n$235,000 Budapest Grand Prix,Budapest,Hungary, clay\n\n$235,000 XXVI Italiacom Open,Palermo,Italy, clay\n\nTOURNAMENTS NEXT WEEK\n\nMEN\n\n$1,413,538 bet-at-home Open – German Tennis Championships,Hamburg,Germany, clay\n\n$638,085 Claro Open Colombia,Bogota,Colombia, hard\n\nWOMEN\n\n$235,000 Collector Swedish Open,Båstad,Sweden, clay\n\n$235,000 Nürnberger Gastein Ladies, BadGastein,Austria\n\nBy Randy Walker\n\n@TennisPublisher\n\nOn the seventh day of the seventh month, the 77-year drought of a British men’s singles champion at Wimbledon ended.\n\nAndy Murray achieved what many thought at one time was an almost laughable concept – a British-born men’s champion at Wimbledon.\n\nHis 6-4, 7-5, 6-4 final-round victory over Novak Djokovic in three hours and nine minutes wiped away decades of British disappointment since Fred Perry was the last British male to win the Wimbledon singles title on July 3, 1936.\n\nThe victory comes one year after Murray was the first British man to win to reach a Wimbledon final in 74 years, when he lost an emotional final to Roger Federer, where the Scotsman famously broke down and cried on-court in disappointment when interviewed by Sue Barker of the BBC. Murray, however, redeemed himself by winning the Olympic gold medal over Federer on the very same Wimbledon Centre Court at the London Olympics just four weeks later. He then became the first British man in 76 years to win a major title when he won the U.S. Open in New York in September.\n\nEntering the Wimbledon final against Djokovic, who he beat to win the U.S. Open and also on the very Centre Court he beat him at in the Olympic semifinals, Murray seemed poised and calm to fulfill his destiny. “The sense is, that I get, is that he feels he should win today” said Patrick McEnroe on ESPN of Murray, stating that Murray was merely “hoping” last year that he would beat the six-time Wimbledon champion Federer.\n\nMurray’s grit and determination to win the title was showcased in coming back from a 1-4 deficit in the second set and a 2-4 deficit in the third set. In the third set, Murray broke Djokovic in the opening game and took a 2-0 lead as many felt like he already had one hand on the trophy, even more so when Murray held an 0-30 advantage on Djokovic’s serve in the third game, staring a double service break cushion. But Djokovic continued to fight and held serve en route to winning four straight games to take a 4-2 lead, Murray showing signs of mental and physical fatigue. Murray steadied himself and broke Djokovic back, held for 4-4, then broke Djokovic again to set up one of the most dramatic games in Wimbledon history as he served for the title at 5-4.\n\nWith the pressure of exorcising over seven decades his country’s tennis frustrations, stress and failures on his shoulders, Murray quickly jumped to 40-0, holding three championship points. However, as the ESPN commentators went appropriately quiet on the verge of such an historic occasion, Djokovic fought off all three match points, conjuring thoughts of his match-point turnarounds against Federer in the 2010 and 2011 US Open semifinals, as Murray began to tighten up. Djokovic then won his fourth point in a row as Murray netted a tentative forehand to stare a break point that would completely change the complexion of the match. Murray moved the score back to deuce with a strong first serve that Djokovic hit long. Djokovic then stabbed Murray with an emotional dart by winning the next point with a net-cord winner to secure a second break point. Murray then held his nerve and after a long baseline rally, curled a forehand cross-court winner to bring the score back to deuce. Djokovic then gained a third break-point opportunity to bring the score level to 5-5 once again when he retrieved a Murray drop shot and, from his shoelaces, dipped a forehand cross court at an extreme angle for a winner, described as “one the great shots you will see at that stage” by John McEnroe on ESPN. An aggressive forehand followed by a backhand volley winner again saved the game again for Murray as the players moved to deuce for a fourth time. Djokovic then failed to put an overhead away – a weakness that has hurt him in the past – and Murray gained his fourth match point when he chased down a drop shot and hit a forehand that Djokovic was unable to handle. Murray, exhausted more mentally than physically, then closed out the title when Djokovic netted a backhand into the net.\n\nMurray told Tom Rinaldi on ESPN the last game of the match was “probably the hardest few points I have had to play in my life.”\n\nIn the on-court post-match presentation, the BBC’s Sue Barker asked Andy how he held on for the last game, saying that it was “torturous to watch” and Murray quipped “Imagine playing it?”\n\n“This is a great moment for Great Britain and for our sport,” said John McEnroe on ESPN. “This guy deserves it.”\n\nBy Randy Walker\n\n@TennisPublisher\n\nAt the start of Wimbledon, many were predicting that the women’s singles champion would win the title without losing a set.\n\nExcept just about everyone believed that it would the dominant No. 1 Serena Williams who would turn the trick and not Marion Bartoli.\n\nTo conclude one of the quirkiest, unusual women’s Wimbledon fortnights in history, Bartoli, perhaps the most eccentric women’s player on the tour today, won the Wimbledon women’s singles title without the loss of a set, defeating Sabine Lisicki 6-1, 6-4 in the championship match.\n\nBartoli is one of the few players who hits both forehands and backhands double-handed and is the first player of that style to win a Wimbledon singles title. Seeded No. 15, she is the lowest ranked player to win the Wimbledon women’s title since Venus Williams, seeded No. 23 and ranked No. 31, beat her in the 2007 Wimbledon final, her only previous appearance in a major tournament final. To accent the surprise of Bartoli’s championship run, she had not advanced passed the quarterfinals of any tournament so far this year and had not won a title since 2011.\n\nLisicki, seeded No. 23, was the betting favorite to win the title against Bartoli, the big-serving German ending the 34-match win streak of defending champion and world No. 1 Serena Williams in the fourth round and No. 4 seed and defending finalist Aga Radwanska in the semifinals. Bartoli emerged from the bottom half of the draw that was vacated of its top two seeds, No. 2 Victoria Azarenka, who pulled out in the second round due to injury, and No. 3 seed Maria Sharapova, who lost in the second round.\n\nAgainst Lisicki, Bartoli was broken in her opening service game of the match, but reeled off six games in a row as Lisicki was not able to get over her nerves and gravity of the situation. Bartoli actually led 6-1, 5-1 and nearly closed out the most lopsided Wimbledon final since Billie Jean King beat Evonne Goolagong 6-0, 6-1 in 1975. Lisicki held serve for only the second time in the match to make the score 2-5, then broke Bartoli to make it 3-5. She then held serve for 4-5, before Bartoli served out the match at love, sealing the title with an ace out wide.\n\nMuch has been written about the unusual mannerisms on court, including frequent kangaroo hops and wild practice swings, her unorthodox groundstroke style and unique serving motion. Her practice sessions have featured elastic bands, weights around her ankles and other contraptions, mostly used for resistance training. Most of the training methods were instituted by her father Walter, a former doctor, who worked as her coach since she started playing the game at age 6. Her dedication to staying with her father as her coach prevented her from playing Fed Cup for France for many years, due to French Tennis Federation coaching rules at those events, costing Bartoli an opportunity to compete in the 2012 Olympics. However, Bartoli ended her coaching relationship with her father earlier this year and has been mentored by Amelie Mauresmo, the French Fed Cup captain and the last French woman to win Wimbledon in 2006.\n\nBartoli had played 47 major tournaments before winning her first major title, which, according to ESPN, is the most in the Open era before winning a first major title. Bartoli lost only eight games combined in her semifinal win over Kirsten Flipkens of Belgium and the final against Lisicki and is also the only player to win Wimbledon with beating a top 10 player en route.\n\n“She really embraced the moment. It really helped that she had been there before” said Mary Joe Fernandez on ESPN, noting that Bartoli played a lot more calm than Lisicki, who experienced more “emotional turbulence,” crying on court in the latter stages of the match when she trailed 6-1, 5-1.\n\n“She just seized the moment,” said Pam Shriver on ESPN of Bartoli. “She knew that this was her opportunity. The draw was not going to open up her like this ever again”\n\nBy Randy Walker\n\n@TennisPublisher\n\nJust when you think you have seen one of the best matches you have ever seen, here comes another one.\n\nIn a Wimbledon classic, Novak Djokovic and Juan Martin del Potro slugged their way through the longest semifinal match in Wimbledon history Friday, battling for four hours, 43 minutes and five sets before the top-seeded Djokovic prevailed 7-5, 4-6, 7-6 (2), 6-7 (6), 6-3.\n\nDjokovic called the match “one of the best matches I have ever been a part of” elaborating “It was probably the most exciting (match) here at Wimbledon. It was such a high level from the first to the last point.”\n\nOn ESPN, Brad Gilbert called the epic, “Without a doubt, the most physical match I have ever seen on grass,” noting that 64 times during the match, a rally last nine shots or more. Many of the rallies featured blistering forehands from Del Potro – some clocked at over 100 miles per hour – and furious counter-punching from Djokovic, with many heart-stopping exchanges, some of which had Del Potro scrambling into the first row of seats on Centre Court.\n\nDjokovic had a chance to close out the match, holding two match points at 6-4 in the fourth-set tiebreaker, but Del Potro used amazing will and a gutsy go-for-broke to win the four points in a row to force a fifth set.\n\nWhen it comes to analyzing the greatest tennis matches of all time, Steve Flink is perhaps the world authority, having written a book THE GREATEST TENNIS MATCHES OF ALL TIME ($28.95, New Chapter Press, available here: http://www.newchaptermedia.com/the-greatest-tennis-matches-of-all-time/) and rates the match as one of the best semifinals in the event’s history.\n\n“For drama and physicality, this semifinal ranks up there as a semifinal Wimbledon classic, but not up there as one of the absolute epics,” Flink wrote in an email. “I don’t feel it was of the same high quality as Djokovic vs. Rafael Nadal match at Roland Garros this year. I say that because Djokovic never played his best tennis. He served terrifically for most of the match and tried his hardest but he also was fighting himself.”\n\n“At one set all, he had 6-5, 0-40 triple set point and let Del Potro escape before taking the tie-break,” Flink continued. “In the fourth set he broke for 4-3 and then played a bad game on his serve to let Del Potro back in again. The tie-break was exhilarating but Djokovic had two match points and should have closed it there. And the fifth was marred somewhat by Del Potro’s weariness.”\n\nFlink, who rates the Roger Federer vs. Rafael Nadal 2008 Wimbledon final as the greatest tennis match of all time in his book, lists the 1927 Wimbledon semifinal – Henri Cochet defeating Bill Tilden 2-6, 4-6, 7-5, 6-4, 6-3 – as the No. 10 match of all time and the highest-ranked semifinal in his book. Flink emailed that the 1977 Wimbledon semifinal – Bjorn Borg defeating Vitas Gerulaitis 6-4, 3-6, 6-3, 3-6, 8-6 – would also rate higher than Del Potro against Djokovic.\n\n“I thought it was an excellent match in many ways and Del Potro played some of his best tennis since winning the US. Open,” wrote Flink, “but Djokovic did not look like the best player in the world to me.”\n\nThe previous longest Wimbledon semifinal took place in 1989 when Boris Becker defeated Ivan Lendl 7-5, 6-7, 2-6, 6-4, 6-3 in four hours and one minute.\n\nDjokovic will meet Andy Murray in Sunday’s final. Murray defeated Poland’s Jerzy Janowicz 6-7 (2), 6-4, 6-4, 6-3.\n\nBy Randy Walker\n\n@TennisPublisher\n\nForty years ago this Sunday, on July 7, 1973, Jan Kodes was the last Czech man to win the men’s singles title at Wimbledon, a distinction that Tomas Berdych would like to take away from the Hall of Famer from Prague.\n\nThe 1973 Wimbledon championships is perhaps more known for the 82 men’s players who boycotted the event in support of Yugoslav player Nikki Pilic’s suspension by his federation. But Kodes was able to navigate through a draw that featured such standouts as Bjorn Borg, Jimmy Connors, Ilie Nastase among others. In the semifinals, he won a dramatic 89 97 57 64 75 match against Britain’s Roger Taylor where the match was delayed by rain with Kodes serving down 4-5 in the fifth set. In the final, Kodes defeated Alex Metreveli of the Soviet Union 61 98 63.\n\nKodes discusses his unique preparation for the Wimbledon final in his book JOURNEY TO GLORY FROM BEHIND THE IRON CURTAIN (New Chapter Press, available at www.NewChapterMedia.com) that included a last-minute panic just before playing the biggest match of his life, as explained in this exclusive book excerpt.\n\nRealization descended on me the next day. I grasped what was ahead of me. The finals of the most prestigious tournament in the world! Playing the finals of any tournament of consequence is still very different from playing the Wimbledon finals. Metreveli made it known that he would have preferred meeting Taylor in the finals.\n\nMany players prompted me: “Please, don’t let the Russian win! That hasn’t happened here yet!” I went to lunch and heard again: “I hope you won’t let the Russian win!” I arrived for practice and a Polish Englishman, an emigrant Mr. Spychala, who was in charge of scheduling play on practice courts and passing out balls, said: ‘Jan, tomorrow I’ll be rooting for you; you won’t let a Russian win, will you?” I had to listen to this all day long! I would have preferred playing against Newcombe or Smith. That would have been a real spectacle!\n\nAnd then it struck me: “What do they say at home? In Prague? The 1968 invasion of Czechoslovakia was still a fresh wound in everyone’s mind. The entire nation is following this development! What if I lose? People will say: Naturally, they ordered him to lose, he had to let him win. It is the same as with the hockey team! ”\n\nSuch was my way of thinking that Friday, a day before the most significant final match of my life. I contemplated all odds, I practiced just 30 minutes and rested; I had a massage and tried to nurse my messed up ankle\n\nThe evening before my final match they showed clips on television from the matches played in the last few days. There was Metreveli defeating Jimmy Connors and Alex Mayer, the winner over the Rumanian Nastase, and then they showed my match against Taylor. In the train of the clips Jack Kramer and Fred Perry made their commentaries. They talked with Dan Maskell, a former Davis Cup player in the era of our Kozeluh and afterwards a Wimbledon commentator for many years: “It is the first time in the history of this championship that two players from communist countries face off in the finals. Who will prevail?”\n\n“If I were to put money down on anybody it would be Kodes,” said Fred Perry. “Why? Because he won Paris twice and he reached the finals on grass at Forest Hills. Metreveli will be nervous, he does not have much experience dealing with the pressures of a final match.”\n\n“I was Kodes’ commentator in 1971 at Forest Hills, where he defeated Newcombe and Ashe,” said Jack Kramer. “He has a dangerous serve return and his game on grass improved tremendously. He is a more complete tennis player now, after winning Roland Garros twice and he showed against Taylor that his serve is adequate.”\n\nThese comments made me feel very good. I persuaded myself that if experts say that I am better, it must be so. I went to bed around 10:30 pm. I called the reception and asked not to forward any calls to me since I did not want to be disturbed in the middle of the night or early in the morning. I put cotton wool in my ears and took half of an aspirin to warm my body through. I did all that in order to have a good rest before the finals. In the morning the receptionist woke me up as I had requested and within a minute I had\n\nfour phone calls! My friend, Franta Novak, told me: “I could not get hold of you!” Others asked: “What is going on with you? It is impossible to reach you!” I only blessed my fantastic foresight that I might get disturbed by phone calls. In real terms I found myself fitting a true “professional” with all that it entailed.\n\nOn the way to Wimbledon I realized that I had not asked anybody to warm me up. But it didn’t disconcert me. Just making my way to the court struggling through the crowds will tire me out! Well, I’ll have a massage done and warm up in the locker room. Inwardly I decided that I did not need the on-the-court warm up.\n\nUpon my arrival I spotted Metreveli warming up on court number two! I panicked and was overwhelmed with a feeling that I should, indeed, warm up a little. I looked around and found no players in sight; they have already left. Damn it, who shall I hit with? At that moment the veterans finished some doubles and they came to the locker room all sweaty and tired out, among them Vic Seixas, a 1953 Wimbledon champion, By the way, Vic was one of the first individuals who came to me after the match with Taylor and told me how unfair was the suspension of play at 4:5; he did not remember anything of the sort ever taking place at Wimbledon before.\n\nI approached him: “Vic, I am due to go on the court to play the finals in a few minutes but I have nobody to warm up with. I am a bit nervous and need just a few minutes to hit the balls back and forth. Would you pop up a few balls for me? Fifteen minutes, no more than that.”\n\n“You don’t think that I could warm you up? I can’t take that responsibility.” He knew what it entailed to be in the finals and he was afraid he could not warm me up sufficiently.\n\n“Vic, only a few minutes; you’ll serve, I’ll return in order to get the rhythm going!”\n\n“But Jan, how can I warm you up?”\n\n“Come on, we are both changed to play…”\n\nI talked him into it, picked up balls and we went to court number two. I started a rally but he was unable to respond successfully. Poor guy was more nervous than I was! I needed only a few hits, a return, some serves, a few volleys, just to get the timing going.\n\nWe spent about twenty minutes on the court and as we were returning to the locker room he said: “I know this did not give you much but I hope that it helped you and you’ll win the first set.”\n\nI took a shower, light massage and off I went to the Centre Court.\n\nI was immensely grateful to Vic for those twenty minutes of warm up. He knew very well the meaning of what he said when he wished me good luck in the first set. On grass, success at the beginning of the match is terribly important. If I start the match off well, my opponent will “miss the train.” And that is exactly what happened!\n\nI won the first set 61.\n\nBy Randy Walker\n\n@TennisPublisher\n\nThe dateline July 2, 2013 provides some interesting anniversaries in Wimbledon women’s history, as documented in the new This Day In Tennis mobile app (www.TennisHistoryApp.com)\n\nWith Sabine Lisicki’s historic upset of world No. 1 Serena Williams, it is interesting to note that July 2, 2013 marks the 25th anniversary of another blonde-haired German with a booming serve and powerful groundstrokes, Hall of Famer Steffi Graf, winning the first of her seven Wimbledon women’s singles titles.\n\nThe woman who Graf defeated on this day 25 years ago also won a Wimbledon title 30 years ago on July 2, 1983, defeating Andrea Jaeger in the final. Navratilova won an astounding nine Wimbledon women’s singles titles. Petra Kvitova, also from the Czech Republic like the naturalized American Navratilova, will be looking to join Navratilova as the only Czech-born multiple winner of Wimbledon women’s singles titles, following up her singles victory in 2011.\n\nNavratilova and Chris Evert, who have each won 18 major singles titles, have been much discussed in the conversation of Serena Williams adding to her major singles title collection as both American legends have won only two more major singles titles than where Serena currently sits with 16 majors. However, the player who Serena should be aiming for is Helen Wills Moody, who has won 19 career major singles titles and is the American record holder in this category. It was 75 years ago on July 2, 1938 when Wills Moody won her 19th and final major title at Wimbledon, defeating Helen Jacobs in the championship match.\n\nThe following are the excerpts as seen in the “This Day In Tennis” mobile app. To order a hard copy of this compilation, the book ON THIS DAY IN TENNIS HISTORY is available for sale at www.newChapterMedia.com and wherever books are sold.\n\n1988 – Nineteen-year-old Steffi Graf ends Martina Navratilova’s six-year stranglehold on the women’s singles title at Wimbledon, defeating the eight-time champion 5-7, 6-2, 6-1 to win her first Wimbledon singles title and capture the third leg of her eventual Grand Slam. Navratilova fails in her attempt to win her ninth Wimbledon singles title and breaking the record that she shares with Helen Wills. Says Navratilova of the loss, “This is how it should happen. I lost to a better player on the final day. This is the end of a chapter, passing the torch if you want to call it that.”\n\n1983 – Martina Navratilova concludes a dominant performance at Wimbledon, defeating Andrea Jaeger 6-0, 6-3 in 54 minutes to win her fourth championship at the All England Club. Navratilova wins seven matches without relinquishing a set en route to the title in less than six hours total time. Says Navratilova, “I’ve been the favorite the last two years to win every match that I’ve played. If I don’t live up to it, the whole world seems to come tumbling down. It’s a disaster, a tragedy, like there’s nothing worse that could happen in the world to you but lose a tennis match. After the French, everyone was predicting that I would come apart at the seams. If anything, it inspired me to play better, more aggressively.” Entering the final, Navratilova had lost only four matches in 18 months, most recently to unheralded Kathy Horvath in the fourth round of the French Open four weeks earlier in one of the biggest upsets in tennis history.\n\n1938 – Thirty-two-year-old Helen Wills Moody wins her 19th – and final – major singles title, easily defeating rival Helen Jacobs 6-4, 6-0 in the women’s singles final at Wimbledon. Jacobs plays the match despite a severely-strained Achilles tendon, which hampers her as she loses the final eight games of the match. The final is the 11th and final meeting between “the two Helens” – with Wills Moody winning the rivalry by a 10-1 margin. Wills Moody’s 19 major singles titles is the all-time record until it is topped in 1970 by Margaret Smith Court, who goes on to win 24 major singles titles."
