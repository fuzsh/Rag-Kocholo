Instead, excrement drops into a tank or bag that must be emptied and\n\ncleaned. The lifetime costs of dry toilets are lower than\n\nthat of flush toilets as they save on water, and some even\n\nproduce fertiliser from the dried waste. In southern Africaâs driest country, where sewage connections reach\n\njust 35% of citizens, they are vital to providing sanitation.\n\nJakugberug Kavari drinks brackish water from a well in the\n\nOmaheke Region.

For example, itâs not\n\na schoolâs responsibility to\n\nteach your child values such\n\nas honesty, humility, respect\n\nand love. Thatâs on you as\n\na parent. In South Africa, a\n\nman with no iota of formal\n\neducation was elected president and presided over the\n\ncontinentâs biggest economy\n\nfor nearly a decade. Perhaps\n\nJacob Zuma did not leave the\n\nglossiest of legacies behind,\n\nbut that has absolutely zero to\n\ndo with his level of education.\n\nThe values he was most\n\nadored for, such as being a\n\ndoting father, adoring husband, anti-apartheid activist\n\nand shrewd politician, are not\n\ntaught in school.\n\nOur society is teeming with\n\ndeadbeat fathers, drunkard\n\nhusbands and online bullies\n\nâ all armed with PhD qualifications.

We are\n\nhoping to release the 2022-2023 equity\n\nreport towards September. We are entering the data manually.â\n\nMajor concern\n\nInstitute for Public Policy Research\n\n(IPPR) director Graham Hopwood said\n\nit was a major concern that the EEC was\n\nnot releasing equity reports on a timely\n\nbasis to show trends in equity employment.\n\nâItâs a major concern. This legislation\n\nwas introduced to ensure the transformation of the workplace, particularly at\n\nupper management level, from the situation pre-1990 when the economy was\n\nstructured along apartheid lines.\n\nâYet we have had no data for several\n\nyears through which we can assess if progress has been made,â he said.\n\nâThe legislation really serves no purpose if the EEC does not produce regular\n\npublic reports. Some people think that\n\nthe affirmative action law has had its day\n\nand should be phased out, while others\n\nare saying we still have a long way to go\n\nand need to increase efforts to achieve\n\nequity - particularly in executive positions. Itâs impossible to judge the situation without up to date reports containing the latest statistics,â he said.\n\nRundu court\n\nThrough a collaboration\n\nwith the Institute of Inventors and Innovators in\n\nSouth Africa, IAN offers\n\na range of programmes\n\nand resources.\n\nAssociation launched\n\nto help inventors\n\nâ¢ PUBLIC URGED TO JOIN\n\nSTAFF REPORTER\n\nWINDHOEK\n\nâItâs the best thing since sliced\n\nbread!â How often have you\n\nheard that saying?

Every so often, the\n\ntank must be emptied. And if the\n\ntoilet is a pit latrine, then one must\n\ndig another hole and move the pot\n\nbefore the next use. There are also\n\nthings you canât always put down\n\nthe hole â such as water â and, like\n\nall toilets, sometimes they need fixing.\n\nNone of this is obvious, especially if\n\nyouâve never used one.\n\nEducation is key\n\nIn 2012, after visiting Namibia, the\n\nUnited Nationsâ (UN) special rapporteur on the human right to safe\n\ndrinking water and sanitation, Catarina de Albuquerque, outlined that\n\npublic participation âin the design,\n\nimplementation and monitoringâ of\n\ntoilet initiatives would be indispensable in providing the country with\n\nsanitation. She also warned that\n\nthe benefits of investing in sanitation would be lost if the government failed to give equal attention\n\nto âhygiene promotion and awareness raising on the benefits of safe\n\nsanitationâ.\n\nSimply put, building toilets would\n\nnot guarantee their use. People must\n\nwant to use them, but to create that\n\nincentive, many Namibians - who\n\nhad lacked adequate sanitation for\n\ndecades - would need to be educated\n\non the benefits and instructed on\n\nproper cleaning, maintenance and\n\nhygiene.\n\nThe government acknowledges\n\nthis. In fact, its 2008 water supply and sanitation policy outlined\n\nthat improving sanitation would be\n\nachieved by âcommunity involvement and participation.â And yet it\n\nappears it has not followed its own\n\nguidance.\n\nIn 2012, the Namibian government\n\nconstructed 10 000 dry Ecosan toilets across five northern regions at\n\na cost of N$181.5 million, but many\n\nare no longer usable because residents say they were not provided\n\nwith instruction, promotion, cleaning or maintenance guidance upon\n\ninstallation.\n\nPaulus Mutikisha, the headman\n\nfor Ekolanaambo, a village in the\n\nOshana Region and one of the beneficiaries in 2012, told Namibian\n\nSun in 2019: âWe have never used\n\n[the toilets] because we were never\n\ntrained on how to use them,â adding that some facilities were not\n\ninstalled properly. âMoney has been\n\nwasted, and the structures are... falling apartâ.\n\nIn 2014, many beneficiaries of a\n\nscheme that aimed to build 6 500\n\npit latrines across the country returned to the bush to defecate. Residents of the Coblenz and Okondjatu\n\nvillages in central Namibia complained about the stench, bemoaning their inability to keep the toilets\n\nin good condition. âWe only have a\n\nfew of these dry pit toilets, and as\n\nmuch as they are helpful, we are\n\nchallenged when it comes to their\n\nmaintenance,â Unjee Usora told The\n\nNamibian.\n\nâAt the end of the day, the toilet is\n\nfilled with faeces.â\n\nUser involvement\n\nThe latest draft of Namibiaâs 2022-\n\n2027 national sanitation and hygiene strategy, reviewed by the\n\nCentre for Collaborative Investigative Journalism (CCIJ), accepts that\n\nâ[u]ser involvement in the choice\n\nof sanitation systems and their construction, operation and maintenance [was] limited... [leading] to\n\nsanitation facilities not being used,\n\noperated or maintained properlyâ.\n\nFlush or dry, providing sanitation\n\nis not just an infrastructure project, and the government is aware\n\nof this too. It was the duty of the\n\nministry of agriculture, water and\n\nland reform to organise âthe training of communities on operation\n\nand maintenance,â according to the\n\ngovernmentâs 2010-2015 national\n\nsanitation and hygiene strategy. The\n\nministry of health and social services, meanwhile, was responsible\n\nfor conducting âhygiene education\n\nin rural areas and informal settlementsâ.\n\nBut this doesnât appear to have happened.\n\nIn fact, according to the latest draft\n\nof the 2022-2027 strategy, the agriculture ministry and ministry of\n\nurban and rural development alone\n\nbuilt 20 230 sanitation facilities\n\nbetween 2009 and 2019, yet âno\n\ncommunity involvement and participation or sanitation hygiene promotion activities were incorporatedâ.\n\nDuring those 10 years, open defecation dropped by just 2.7% nationwide, while sanitation levels in urban areas actually declined.\n\nCCIJ asked Dr Elijah Ngurare, the\n\nagriculture ministryâs deputy executive director for water affairs, why\n\nNamibia failed to engage communities in training and operation or to\n\nrun a national campaign promoting\n\nhygiene.\n\nHe said: âSanitation challenges have\n\nbeen acknowledged and government\n\nhas now decided to scale up the process... construction, maintenance\n\nand rehabilitation is going to be the\n\nnorm. This includes both rural urban and rural sanitationâ.\n\nBut the government has made implementing such strategies as complicated as possible. Rather than\n\ncentralising responsibility for improving sanitation, six ministries, regional councils and local authorities\n\nhave each been tasked with its delivery: The agriculture, health, urban\n\nand rural development, education,\n\nenvironment and gender ministries\n\neach have funding for sanitation in\n\ntheir budgets.\n\nMeanwhile, local authorities â partly\n\nfunded by central government â are\n\nresponsible for providing sanitation\n\nin urban areas, including informal\n\nsettlements, and the ministry of\n\nwork and transport is responsible\n\nfor developing new and managing\n\nexisting wet sanitation systems.\n\nDifficult to monitor\n\nThis division of duties and funding\n\nmakes it especially difficult to monitor and track investment in sanitation, as well as Namibiaâs adherence to the 2015 Ngor declaration,\n\nin which the government promised\n\nto annually commit a minimum\n\nof 0.5% of gross domestic product\n\n(GDP) to sanitation and hygiene\n\nfrom 2020 onward.\n\nThe latest version of the 2022-2027\n\nsanitation and hygiene strategy acknowledges that the government\n\nand local authorities âdo not have a\n\nclear budget line for sanitation... As\n\na result, the sanitation budget is...\n\ndifficult to trackâ.\n\nMatheus Shuuya, water, sanitation,\n\nand hygiene specialist at Unicef Namibia, saidd this contributed to poor\n\ncoordination of the sanitation sector,\n\nsomething the government admitted in its fifth National Development\n\nPlan.âThe sector is... not playing together,â he explained, adding he was\n\ndesperate to see the Namibian government develop a separate sanitation budget so that it could monitor\n\nfunding moving forward.\n\nThe consequences of insufficient\n\ngovernance are evident in surveying\n\nthe Namibian landscape. Damaged,\n\ndisused and derelict government toilets can be found across the country.\n\nOften, they are filthy beyond use,\n\nblocked by newspaper or filled with\n\nexcrement, and a considerable number no longer function.\n\nCutting corners\n\nAt a time when sanitation is in desperate need of a dedicated, coordinated and potentially more costly\n\napproach, those in the private sector\n\nsay the government has complicated\n\ntheir efforts to provide more sustainable options.\n\nEline van der Linden is the executive\n\ndirector of Omuramba Impact Investing, the sole distributor of a dry\n\ntoilet called the Enviro Loo.\n\nUnlike the ventilated pit latrines\n\npreferred by the government, her\n\ntoilets reduce odour by separating\n\nwaste from urine and are built with\n\na closed container that prevents\n\ngroundwater pollution. Crucially,\n\nshe also offers user and maintenance\n\ntraining upon installation - including refresher courses on cleaning\n\nand maintenance with locals who\n\ncan then charge the community a\n\nfee for their services as cleaners or\n\njanitors.\n\nBut the technology and training\n\ncomes at a higher price tag, which is\n\nwhy Van der Linden no longer bids\n\non government tenders. Her cost\n\nsimply exceeds government specifications.\n\nâ[The government] thinks cheap\n\nsolutions will last,â she said, adding\n\nthat she has never seen training included as part of a tender.\n\nâWhen they do put dry toilets down,\n\nthey do it without any additional\n\neffort... No toilet system will work\n\nwithout educating communities on\n\ndaily cleaning.â\n\nBut while Van der Lindenâs toilets\n\nare more expensive, a sanitation crisis also comes at a cost.\n\nNamibiaâs health minister Dr\n\nKalumbi Shangula told CCIJ that\n\ninadequate access to sanitation was\n\nleading to sickness and infection,\n\nwhile the risk of disease and pollution also threatens tourism and agricultural industries.\n\nâThereâs a need to establish what the\n\ncost of inaction is,â Shuuya added.\n\nâPerhaps the decision-makers donât\n\nhave the evidence to say âthis is what\n\nweâre losing out on by not investing\n\nin sanitationâ.â\n\nBut while the full cost of Namibiaâs\n\ncrisis is unknown, it is clear the government has significant work to do\n\nto address it in a timely manner.\n\nA weak defence\n\nBy the governmentâs own admission,\n\nsanitation has stalled in recent years,\n\nand the various ministries tasked\n\nwith improving it have each failed to\n\nprioritise the sector.\n\nThe urban and rural development\n\nministry, for example, has failed to\n\nhit its toilet targets in four of the last\n\nfive years.\n\nIn 2021, the ministry promised to\n\nconstruct 10 000 new toilets in rural areas, but built only 980 before\n\nclaiming the original target was âerroneously indicatedâ and that 1 000\n\nwas the real target.\n\nIn explaining the failure to meet\n\neven the 1 000 toilets target, urban\n\nand rural development ministry said\n\nâlate submission of activity plans\n\nand accountability reports from the\n\nregions result[ed] in late approval of\n\nbudgetsâ.\n\nAnd 14 years ago, the government\n\noutlined plans â with input from\n\nfour ministries, local authorities and\n\nthe Office of the Prime Minister â to\n\nstimulate âbehavioural changeâ with\n\na national hygiene campaign. This\n\nwas supposed to happen by 2015,\n\nyet Namibia has still not had a nationwide campaign to promote both\n\nsanitation and hygiene.\n\nThe agriculture ministry, charged\n\nwith the coordination of government sanitation services, admitted\n\nvia email to CCIJ that challenges in\n\nimproving sanitation included âpoor\n\nsanitation practices and the non-involvement of communitiesâ, but said\n\nlimited access to water, resources\n\nand finance remained a hindrance.\n\nThis while vast sums have been allocated to the ministries responsible\n\nfor sanitation. Whether those funds\n\nare actually spent on sanitation is a\n\nmatter of priority, and, in 2022, the\n\nagriculture ministry cut its water\n\nsupply and sanitation coordination\n\nbudget by 72.7%.\n\nNgurare admitted that âmost funding earmarked for water and sanitation in the last couple of years had\n\nunfortunately been redirected to the\n\nNeckartal Damâ, Namibiaâs largest\n\ndam that supports a large irrigation\n\nscheme in the south.\n\nShangula also blamed a lack of\n\nfunds, arguing low tax revenues prevented Namibia from prioritising\n\nsanitation.\n\nâYou can only [improve sanitation]\n\nif you have money, and we donât have\n\nenough for it,â he said. âThe economic base of Namibia is very small.â\n\nBut, again, it may just be an issue of\n\nprioritisation.\n\nâIncorrectâ comparison\n\nIn recent years, the lionâs share of\n\nNamibiaâs health budget allocation\n\nhas been spent on curative rather\n\nthan preventative services, with little\n\nleft for projects that could promote\n\nsanitation and hygiene.\n\nAnd while Namibia may have a narrow tax base, according to the World\n\nBank, it generates more tax revenue\n\nper capita than Botswana, Lesotho and almost as much as Zambia,\n\nthree countries in southern Africa\n\nwith better sanitation coverage than\n\nNamibia. Shangula denied that other countries in the region were performing better than Namibia â with\n\nlower defecation rates and better\n\naccess to sanitation â despite being\n\npresented with data that ran counter\n\nto his claim.\n\nâBotswana has a similar setup with\n\nNamibia... they are struggling with\n\nthe same issues we are,â he said. âI\n\ndonât think that comparison is correct.â While Botswana also struggles with poor informal settlements,\n\nsparsely populated rural areas, water\n\nscarcity and an arid climate, according to the World Health Organisation and Unicefâs joint monitoring\n\nprogramme, 80% of its citizens have\n\naccess to at least basic sanitation,\n\nmore than double that of Namibia.\n\nEven at the highest levels of government, a lack of familiarity with the\n\ndata is not uncommon. In Namibiaâs\n\npreparatory meeting notes to the\n\nUN ahead of the 2023 water conference, the government claimed 46%\n\nof rural communities have access to\n\nâsafely managed sanitationâ, but Namibiaâs own census mapping report\n\n- published in the same year â states\n\nthat less than 27% of Namibians in\n\nrural areas have such access.\n\nAgriculture minister Calle Schlettwein, who attended the conference in\n\nNew York, declined to comment on\n\nthe discrepancy.\n\nEleven years ago, De Alberqueque\n\nsaid Namibiaâs sanitation deficit was\n\nnot a result of a lack of finances, but\n\na âlack of a common visionâ, âprioritisationâ and an âabsence of effective\n\ncoordination among the different\n\nministries and between central and\n\nlocal governmentâ. In 2023, these are\n\nstill the biggest obstacles to improving sanitation. But where the government has fallen short in reaching its\n\nstated sanitation goals, others are\n\nnow stepping in. However, urbanisation and climate change are pushing\n\nback, escalating a crisis that threatens more death, disease and contamination in the next decade.\n\n*Namibiaâs rural development\n\nand coordination budget drop was\n\ncalculated using Vote 17 found in\n\ngovernment accountability reports from 2019-2020 and 2021-\n\n2022.\n\nThis report was produced by\n\nCCIJ, a non-profit organisation\n\nthat brings together investigative reporters, visual storytellers\n\nand data scientists to investigate\n\nkey global issues affecting underserved communities.

Business7 compiled this overall report from articles\n\nposted on the website of the African Energy Chamber.\n\nP:10\n\nThe Orange Basinâs recent indings in ofshore\n\nNamibia have brought attention to the possibility of commercial oil and gas ventures. Consequently, the country is well-positioned to gain\n\nfrom a comprehensive local content strategy\n\nthat focuses on implementing efective policies and promoting economic diversiication\n\nover the long term.\n\nâWe want to come in and invest, trade, and to\n\npromote returns with regards to our projects\n\nin Namibia,â stated Tarik Berair, business development manager at Technip, a global leader\n\nin energy projects, technologies, systems and\n\nservices.\n\nâWhat I see today are projects from the oil\n\nand gas sector, but also from the green hydrogen and green ammonia industries, that can all\n\naccumulate at the same time and provide opportunities in-country.\n\nâWe work closely with the local stakeholder so\n\nthat when we come in, we can evaluate the baseline that is already based in the country, which\n\nlets us know what we need to bring in from our\n\nside in terms of quality and safety,â Berair said.\n\nTransformation\n\nNamibiaâs oil and gas sector is on the verge of\n\nsigniicant transformation, ofering the potential to enhance local content across the countryâs broader energy industry. With anticipated growth in the sector and participation from\n\nboth regional and global players, new prospects are expected to emerge within the domestic market.\n\nâLocal content is diverse, and we need to pay\n\nattention to the social dynamics in the continent,â said Sergio Ferreira, local energy advisor\n\nfor Sub-Saharan Africa at Norwegian Energy\n\nPartners.\n\nâBefore you actually look at how local people\n\nand businesses can beneit, you irst have to\n\nlook at demand and igure out what international oil companies need in order to promote\n\nlocal content development,â Ferreira stated.\n\nAccording to panelists at the NIEC 2023, the\n\nNamibian governmentâs focus on enhancing\n\nlocal content has the potential to expedite economic growth and social development.\n\nâBy striving to establish itself as a regional\n\nenergy hub in Sub-Saharan Africa, Namibia\n\ncan foster a competitive workforce, which will\n\nnecessitate collaboration with key stakeholders\n\nto forge dependable local partnerships.\n\nâWhen the oil and gas organisations prepare\n\nthe roles available for their employees, they\n\nneed to adequately determine and evaluate the\n\ncompetence required,â stated Jemma Langley,\n\nhead of the permanent local content committee\n\n(PLCC) and secretariat at the ministry of energy\n\nand energy industries in Trinidad and Tobago.\n\nâThis will allow these companies to evaluate\n\nthe gaps that need to be illed and what steps\n\nneed to be taken to address the development of\n\nlocal content building,â Langley said.\n\nStrategy\n\nPanel discussions at the conference highlighted\n\nthe potential of a comprehensive and sustained\n\nlocal content development strategy to foster\n\nhuman, social and economic development, ultimately leading to tangible beneits for businesses operating in Namibia.\n\nPrioritising the development of the workforce\n\nand suppliers, the upstream sector in Namibia\n\nhas a favourable outlook for generating equitable and sustainable value creation.\n\nâToday, local content is a topical issue. It has\n\nbeen a topical issue for the last ive years. If you\n\nlook at our laws, we basically enacted a law that\n\nplaced conditions on license holders focused on\n\ncreating in-country value,â said Carlo Mcleod,\n\ndeputy director of petroleum afairs at the ministry of mines and energy in Namibia.\n\nâWe want local companies to become part\n\nof our strategies towards developing local\n\ncontent,â Mcleod added.\n\nThe panelists underscored the importance of\n\nNamibia collaborating with oil companies to\n\npromote investment in local communities as a\n\ncrucial element for achieving sustainable development. They emphasised that the Namibian\n\ngovernment should prioritise building a globally competitive workforce and supply chain as\n\nit advances the development of its oil, gas and\n\nwider energy industries.\n\nâWe want to make sure that the opportunities for employment are open. We would like\n\nthe host country to ensure the participation\n\nand training of their workforce, because if you\n\nhire local personnel, it allows us to cut costs\n\nand bring value to the country where we are\n\noperating,â said Nillian Mulemi, the CEO of\n\nPetrofund in Namibia.\n\nInvestment\n\nThe NIEC 2023 also featured a panel discussion\n\nexploring the investment landscape in Namibia,\n\nwith a slate of high-level energy players sharing\n\ntheir insights into how the emerging oil producer can foster long-term and diversiied growth.\n\nâWeâve got a lourishing exploration and appraisal industry, however, the development and\n\nproduction industry is still new to us,â stated\n\nShiwana Ndeunyema, acting managing director for Namcor.\n\nâWe need to be able to understand where it is\n\nwe want to participate and where we can add\n\nvalue, while creating value for service companies and local businesses to participate in exploration and production,â Ndeunyema.\n\nThe panelists emphasised the signiicance of\n\ninancial institutions in optimising the low of\n\ncapital into Namibiaâs energy industry and highlighted the need for eicient management services and processes. They stressed that trusted\n\ninancial partners, with strong local ties, are essential for driving future growth and development in the sector.\n\nâWhen you look at investment in the sector,\n\nit is fundamental to acknowledge economic\n\ngrowth. We need to ask ourselves how we bring\n\ninvestment into the sector, not only towards\n\nfossil fuels, but also towards renewable opportunities,â said Baronice Hans, managing director of Bank Windhoek.\n\nâWe need to look at all our key stakeholders\n\nand how we can balance their interests. We need\n\nto think about how we approach these opportunities and how we diversify. We need to create\n\nconidence in our country and think about how\n\ncapital will beneit the key stakeholders in this\n\ncountry,â Hans added.\n\nEnergy hub\n\nEstablishing Namibia as a potential energy hub\n\nin the region will demand substantial and diversiied investment across the entire energy value\n\nchain, supported by international participation.\n\nTherefore, the panelists explored possibilities\n\nfor advancements within Namibiaâs investment\n\nlandscape, which has the potential to unify the\n\nindustry and instill conidence among investors, service providers, and local businesses.\n\nâCompanies have had conidence in Namibia,\n\nand this includes conidence in the future,â\n\nstated Dr. Klaus Endresen, chairman of the\n\nNamibia Petroleum Operators Association,\n\nadding that: âWhen we start moving into a new\n\narea, until we might get to the revenue, you will\n\ngo through many phases, take many risks, and\n\nthat is what we do in our industry.â\n\nThe speakers also highlighted that the extraction of hydrocarbons can accelerate the energy\n\ntransition in Namibia and the broader Southern African region. They emphasised the signiicance of establishing and sustaining an appealing investment environment in Namibiaâs\n\nextractive industry. Despite the risks involved\n\nin exploration, the panelists expressed optimism about the prospects for development in\n\nNamibiaâs energy sector.\n\nâNamibia has maintained a very peaceful and\n\nsigniicant investment environment that is attractive for participants and their interests,â\n\nsaid Kauna Ndilula, advisory board member\n\nfor the Namibia Investment Promotion and\n\nDevelopment Board (NIPDB).\n\nâAs we present these opportunities, it is important to ensure a stable environment, but also\n\ninclusive development. Namibia is a very progressive country and diversiication is part of\n\nthe issues we need to address,â Ndilula added.\n\nDiversification\n\nThe panelists underscored the importance of\n\npreserving a stable environment that prioritises\n\ndiversiication and inclusivity for Namibia to\n\nparticipate in the future of energy development.\n\nThey also emphasised that the conidence in\n\nNamibiaâs investment landscape hinges on the\n\ncountryâs collaborative eforts with international players and neighbouring nations.\n\nâAngola and Namibia have a shared history\n\nthat goes back many, many years, which has\n\nserved to promote a longstanding relationship\n\nbetween our countries,â stated Osvaldo InÃ¡cio,\n\nthe executive director of Angolaâs Sonangol and\n\nchairman of Sonangol Integrated Logistic Services (Sonils).\n\nâWe need to open the door for young, talented\n\npeople, and our progression with our friends in\n\nNamibia will incorporate shared experiences.\n\nâIt is my belief that we will beneit from what\n\nother countries can teach us and in essence,\n\nthat is what we are dealing with here today,â\n\nInÃ¡cio said.\n\n2 BUSINESS NEWS\n\nFROM PAGE 1\n\nMines and energy minister Tom Alweendo.

And by mid-April Brent\n\nreached US$86 and WTI US$83 per barrel.\n\nBut oil has now started to retreat again, an unexpected development during a war involving\n\na major oil exporter, and at a time when a giant\n\nconsumer like China is reopening after three\n\nyears of economic isolation.\n\nThis shows that oil price forecasts continue\n\nto be unreliable.\n\nThe economic outlook and Chinese consumption growth are key to demand expectations,\n\nwhile Russia is the wild card in terms of supply.\n\nUntil uncertainty around these three factors\n\ndissipates, global oil markets will not have a\n\nclear direction.\n\nEconomic outlook\n\nOil demand is closely linked to economic growth\n\nbecause a slowing economy shrinks income,\n\nleading people to curtail expenditure and travel\n\nless, and slowing down manufacturing that uses\n\noil.\n\nVarious economic forecasts have recently highlighted the major challenges facing\n\nthe global economy, but widely prevailing\n\nuncertainty seems to top the list.\n\nIn its April 2023 World Economic Outlook,\n\nthe International Monetary Fund (IMF)\n\nemphasised a high level of uncertainty âamid\n\ninancial sector turmoil, high inlation, ongoing\n\nefects of Russiaâs invasion of Ukraine, and three\n\nyears of Covidâ.\n\nThe World Bank has also warned that âa lost\n\ndecade could be in the making for the global\n\neconomyâ as ânearly all the economic forces\n\nthat powered progress and prosperity over the\n\nlast three decades are fadingâ.\n\nAprilâs Opec Monthly Oil Market Report kept\n\nits forecast for economic growth and oil demand\n\nlargely unchanged from previous reports, but\n\nsaid: âThe global economy will continue to\n\nnavigate through challenges including high\n\ninlation, higher interest rates particularly in\n\nthe Eurozone and the US, and high debt levels\n\nin many regions.â\n\nIt stated that âthese uncertainties surrounding current oil market dynamicsâ were behind\n\nits decision to cut production.\n\nThe China factor\n\nChina is the worldâs second-largest oil consumer\n\nand the second-largest economy after the US.\n\nSo all eyes have been on its oil demand since\n\nthe country ended the nearly three-year zeroCovid policy that severely restricted its peoplesâ\n\nmobility and economic activity.\n\nToday, it is the main bullish factor in many\n\nglobal economic forecasts.\n\nThe IMFâs managing director, Kristalina Georgieva, recently said: âChina this year is going to\n\ncontribute about one-third of global [ economic]\n\ngrowth. We calculated that 1% more growth in\n\nChina translates into 0.3% more growth for the\n\neconomies that are connected to China.â\n\nThe IEA believes China will account for half\n\nof the global increase in oil demand this year.\n\nGoldman Sachs expects Chinaâs oil demand\n\ngrowth to boost Brent by roughly US$15 per\n\nbarrel.\n\nHowever, such enthusiasm is not universally\n\nshared. A Citibank report says Chinaâs postCovid recovery seems slower than expected.\n\nBeing an export-driven economy, the Asian\n\npowerhouse is exposed to the health of the rest\n\nof the world. A weakening global economy will\n\nreduce demand for Chinese exports, with negative repercussions on its economy and therefore oil demand.\n\nSimilarly, Chinaâs National Bureau of Statistics\n\nsaid âthe external environment is even more\n\ncomplex, inadequate demand remains prominent and the foundation for economic recovery\n\nis not solid yetâ.\n\nOr, as the Saudi energy minister, Abdulaziz\n\nbin Salman Al Saud, reportedly said when asked\n\nabout an oil demand rebound recently: âIâll\n\nbelieve it when I see it.â\n\nRussia: not done yet\n\nAs a major oil producer and exporter, Russia also\n\nhas a massive inluence on global oil markets.\n\nDespite sanctions since the beginning of the\n\nwar in Ukraine (and following the annexation\n\nof Crimea in 2014), Russia continues to be the\n\nworldâs third-largest oil producer after the US\n\nand Saudi Arabia.\n\nWhen Russia invaded Ukraine, oil prices\n\nspiked due to fears of a loss of Russian supply.\n\nThe IEA warned the resulting 3 mb/d loss\n\n(around one-third of Russiaâs total and almost\n\n3% of world production) could produce âthe\n\nbiggest supply crisis in decadesâ.\n\nAnalysts from investment bank JP Morgan\n\nsaid Russia could cut up to 5 mb/d of production driving global oil prices to a âstratosphericâ\n\nUS$380 per barrel.\n\nSuch gloomy scenarios did not materialise.\n\nRussian oil continued to low but changed\n\ndirection from Europe to Asia, helping to ease\n\nprice pressure for consumers everywhere. And\n\nRussiaâs cuts in retaliation for sanctions have\n\nso far been smaller than expected.\n\nOf course, it could cut more, especially if this\n\nwould put more economic pressure on the west\n\nand afect support for Ukraine.\n\nThis cocktail of uncertainties should encourage a more cautious stance when it comes to\n\npredicting oil prices, this year at least. Some\n\nanalysts have already reduced their 2023 price\n\nforecasts, with estimates varying between\n\nUS$81 and US$100 a barrel.\n\nExpect more revisions.\n\nAs one study that tracked the evolution of oil\n\nprices over four decades said: âall price expectations are subject to errorâ.\n\nâ The Conversation\n\nPHOTO UNSPLASH/\n\nJOHN CAMERON\n\nSome analysts have already\n\nreduced their 2023 price forecasts, with estimates varying\n\nbetween US$81 and US$100 a\n\nbarrel.\n\nP:12\n\n4 AT YOUR FINGERTIPS\n\nEven though the ocean is crucial to African nations and their people, foreign\n\nentities may prioritise their own interests, which can sometimes harm African\n\ncountries and their citizens. Ifesinachi Okafor-Yarwood, a lecturer at the University of St Andrews, and Freedom C. Onuoha, a professor of political science\n\nat the University of Nigeria, explore this statement.\n\nAfricaâs oceans\n\nprotected for\n\nbig corporates\n\nA\n\nfricaâs valuable ocean resources have\n\ndrawn the interest of foreign nations,\n\nparticularly those in the West and Asia.\n\nHow they exploit these resources can be\n\nproblematic because these oceans ofer a\n\nwide range of important resources â from\n\nish to minerals and hydrocarbons â that are\n\nalso crucial to the continentâs economy and\n\nfood security.\n\nBut, in some countries, foreign interests\n\ndominate. For instance, the continentâs oil\n\nexploration, shipping, ports infrastructure,\n\nand industrial ishing sectors are sometimes\n\ndominated by foreign companies.\n\nAngolaâs oil production, for example, is dominated by the major international oil exploration and production companies including Total (France) with a 41% market share,\n\nChevron (US) with 26%, Exxon Mobil (US)\n\nwith 19%, and BP (UK) with 13%.\n\nAnd so, despite these waters being vital to\n\nAfrican countries and their citizens, foreign\n\nactors will act in a way thatâs in their best interests - at times to the detriment of African\n\ncountries and citizens.\n\nSecurity\n\nOne illustration of this relates to maritime\n\n(ocean) security.\n\nThe United Nations Convention on the Law\n\nof the Sea (UNCLOS) stipulates that coastal\n\ncountries are responsible for managing the\n\nsecurity of their territorial waters (up to 12\n\nnautical miles from their shorelines) and that\n\nof their exclusive economic zones, between 12\n\nand 200 nautical miles from their shoreline.\n\nThis includes protection against unlawful acts\n\nat sea, such as illegal ishing, piracy and armed\n\nrobbery, terrorism and other related crimes.\n\nHowever, the same convention allows other\n\ncountries to act, against piracy, for example,\n\nin the exclusive economic zones.\n\nDrawing on our expertise on African maritime governance and security, we reviewed\n\nliterature, databases of policy documents and\n\nmaritime security reports, to explore how nonAfrican countries selectively frame what constitutes threats.\n\nHow these threats are framed determines the\n\nresponse to them and how those response are\n\nresourced. The efect is that it undermines a\n\nholistic notion of maritime security that would\n\nbeneit the African people.\n\nIllogical\n\nWe argue that the focus by non-African countries is on piracy and armed robbery at sea which\n\nthreaten resource extraction, transportation\n\nand safety. They hardly focus on the protection of Africaâs marine resources, in particular from pollution and illegal ishing caused by\n\nforeign powers.\n\nThis approach is illogical. It fails to recognise that thereâs a link between deprivation and\n\nmaritime crimes, including piracy and armed\n\nrobbery at sea. African coastal communities,\n\nmany of whom are already marginalised and\n\ndeprived, are highly dependent on marine resources. The depletion of these resources only\n\nworsens their situation.\n\nFailure to prioritise the protection of African\n\nmarine resources will push people further into\n\npoverty and continue the cycle of insecurity\n\nat sea.\n\nFighting piracy\n\nThe foreign focus on piracy is clear. Over 20\n\nUnited Nations Security Council Resolutions\n\nor presidential statements have been issued\n\non piracy in the Gulf of Aden (East Africa) and\n\nthe Gulf of Guinea (West and Central Africa).\n\nPiracy is a problem. It can involve kidnap for\n\nransom and, in extreme cases, can lead to the\n\ndeath of crew members.\n\nBetween 2005 and 2012, pirates in the Gulf\n\nof Aden received an estimated US$500 million\n\nransom. Almost 2 000 sailors were kidnapped\n\nand many were killed.\n\nAt the heights of piracy in the Gulf of Guinea,\n\npirates accrued about US$4 million every year.\n\nThe irst UN resolutions on piracy in Africa\n\nwere introduced in the Gulf of Aden in 2008\n\nand in the Gulf of Guinea in 2011. Since then,\n\npiracy incidents have reduced in both Gulfs.\n\nFish and the environment\n\nBut the problem is, the focus of African nations\n\nneeds to be on the protection of ish stocks and\n\nthe environment which afects the livelihoods\n\nand food sources of African citizens.\n\nSome threats â like oil pollution and illegal\n\nishing â are often perpetrated by foreign entities.\n\nFish is a source of food and income for millions of Africans. When thereâs less ish catch,\n\npoverty increases as do the number of out of\n\nschool children and poor health.\n\nYet, as we found during our research, no UN\n\nresolutions exist for environmental degradation or marine resource plunder. This is typically caused by pollution and illegal ishing\n\nperpetrated by foreign companies and distant\n\nwater vessels.\n\nAn agreement to put an end to harmful isheries subsidies, which enable overishing and\n\nillegal ishing, was adopted at the World Trade\n\nOrganisationâs ministerial conference in 2022.\n\nBut, to date, only four countries have accented\n\nto the agreement.\n\nAlong with pollution, overishing and illegal\n\nishing are key factors that contribute to the\n\ndepletion of Africaâs ish stocks, pushing people\n\ninto poverty. In West Africa, for instance, the\n\nincome of small-scale ishers decreased by up\n\nto 40% between 2006 and 2016.\n\nReduced catch also led to a decrease in the\n\navailability, and an increase in prices, of ish\n\nfor local consumption.\n\nIllegal fishing\n\nIllegal ishing, perpetrated largely by foreign\n\nleets, exacerbates the depletion of ish stocks.\n\nIt has a massive impact on economies. In West\n\nAfrica it costs six countries an estimated US$2.3\n\nbillion every year.\n\nDespite the international coalitionâs success in\n\nneutralising piracy in the Gulf of Aden, illegal\n\nishing by foreign vessels continues to pose a\n\nsigniicant threat to the food and economic security of millions of Africans.\n\nWhatâs ironic is that illegal ishing has been\n\ncited as a major contributory factor to piracy\n\nin the Gulf of Aden. And in the Gulf of Guinea,\n\nhistorical pollution by foreign oil companies,\n\nand resulting deprivation, gave way to militancy\n\nwhich morphed into piracy.\n\nConceivably, as more people are pushed into\n\npoverty, more people are pushed towards criminal activities, including piracy-related activities.\n\nShifting focus\n\nFocusing mainly on piracy isnât the solution.\n\nIts root causes â depleted ish stocks, loss of\n\nlivelihoods and poverty â need to be addressed.\n\nMaritime safety and security in Africa will\n\nonly be achieved when the same level of attention and resources that are given to countering piracy by African governments and their\n\nforeign counterparts is extended to sustainable isheries and curbing of marine pollution.\n\nAchieving this balance requires several clear\n\nactions.\n\nFive steps\n\nFirst, the African Union (AU) and regional\n\neconomic communities must take collective\n\naction to push for an end to exploitative relationships in the continentâs ocean resources. This includes urging the UN to recognise\n\nillegal ishing and associated crimes as grave\n\nsecurity threats.\n\nInternational partners must go beyond rhetoric and stop inancing the exploitation of the\n\ncontinentâs resources through subsidies that\n\nallows for legal exploitation of depleted species\n\nand illegal ishing.\n\nSecondly, African states should adopt a holistic approach to maritime security that encourages cooperation and collaboration across\n\nsectors, as outlined in the AIMS 2050 and\n\nLomÃ© Charter. This approach should use piracy\n\ncountermeasures to combat illegal ishing and\n\nassociated activities.\n\nThird, to understand the impact of threats\n\nto maritime security and resource extraction,\n\nAfrican voices (at the community level) should\n\nbe relected in the formulation of policies and\n\nstrategies.\n\nFourth, while successful in reducing piracy,\n\nthe current approach to maritime security in\n\nAfrica is not sustainable.\n\nThe root causes of insecurity, such as youth\n\nunemployment and environmental degradation, should be addressed. This requires urgent\n\nattention with a focus on social and ecological well-being.\n\nFinally, the reduction in incidents of piracy\n\nand armed robbery at sea, especially in the Gulf\n\nof Guinea, is due to cooperation, collaboration\n\nand coordination between regional navies and\n\ntheir partners.\n\nThis approach is widely recognised as sustainable. It should be maintained, and indeed extended to address other security threats at sea.\n\nTaking these steps will ensure that no one is\n\nleft behind and that the continentâs prospects\n\nfor future prosperity are not undermined.\n\nâ The Conversation\n\nPHOTO UNSPLASH/DAVID CLODE\n\nServing foreign interests\n\nFailure to prioritise the protection of African marine resources will push people further into\n\npoverty and continue the cycle\n\nof insecurity at sea.\n\nThe Conversation\n\nP:13\n\nBusiness7 is aired weekly on Wednesdays at 21:00 on NTV - channel 285\n\non DStv and channel 25 on GOtv - with repeats at 20:30 on Saturdays and\n\n17:30 on Sundays.\n\nIt focuses on current issues in the Namibian economy and analyses how global developments\n\nimpact the country.\n\nFor advertising contact [email protected]\n\nONEUPTWO.COM/NTV\n\nGen.

It is\n\nthought to be one of the largest pink\n\ndiamonds in history ever to be recovered, Storm Mountain said.\n\nStorm Mountain, which is jointly\n\nowned by Namakwa Diamonds\n\nLimited and the Government of\n\nLesotho, says the diamond weighs\n\nin at 108.39ct and was recovered at\n\nits Kao mine in Lesotho. It has not\n\nyet been named, a Storm Mountain\n\nspokesperson told News24.\n\nIn July 2022, the BBC reported that\n\nthe Lulo Rose, found in Angola, was\n\nthe largest pink diamond to be found\n\nin 300 years. At 170 carats, it was understood to be the biggest since the\n\nfamous Daria-i-Noor, which is now\n\nknown as one of Iranâs national jewels.\n\nThe Daria-i-Noor is 185 carats, though\n\nit is believed be the largest part of a\n\nbigger diamond that was cut into two.\n\nThe Kao mine, which is in the Butha-Buthe district, mines the biggest\n\nkimberlite pipe in Lesotho and has\n\nproduced a number of exceptional\n\npink diamonds. In recent years, these\n\ninclude the Pink Eternity (47.81ct) in\n\n2022, the Pink Dawn (25.97ct) and\n\nPink Palesa (21.68ct) in 2021, as well\n\nas the Rose of Kao (29.59ct) in 2018.\n\nThe latest diamond breaks the companyâs own records, however. Previously, the largest diamond ever\n\nfound by Storm Mountain was the\n\nPink Eternity, which it sold in 2022.\n\nPink diamonds are rarer than white\n\ndiamonds and often fetch higher\n\nprices. In 2022, a private collector\n\npaid US$57.7 million (over R1 billion),\n\na record price per carat, for the 11.15-\n\ncarat Williamson Pink Star â which\n\nhad attracted another 50 bids.\n\nLesotho Minister of Natural Resources Mohlomi Moleko has commented of the diamond that âit is\n\none of the most significant diamonds\n\nfound to date in Lesothoâ. âFin24\n\nSouth Africaâs\n\nproducer inflation eases\n\nSouth Africaâs producer inflation\n\ncooled more than forecast to a 13-\n\nmonth low in March, signaling price\n\npressures along the value chain may\n\nbe easing.

Spending even a\n\nfew minutes in meditation can help restore\n\nyour calm and inner peace.\n\nAnyone can practice meditation. Itâs simple\n\nand inexpensive. And it doesnât require any\n\nspecial equipment.\n\nAnd you can practice meditation wherever\n\nyou are â whether youâre out for a walk, riding\n\nthe bus, waiting at the doctorâs office or even\n\nin the middle of a difficult business meeting.\n\nUnderstanding meditation\n\nMeditation has been practiced for thousands\n\nof years. Meditation originally was meant to\n\nhelp deepen understanding of the sacred and\n\nmystical forces of life. These days, meditation\n\nis commonly used for relaxation and stress\n\nreduction.\n\nMeditation is considered a type of mindbody complementary medicine. Meditation\n\ncan produce a deep state of relaxation and a\n\ntranquil mind.\n\nDuring meditation, you focus your attention\n\nand eliminate the stream of jumbled thoughts\n\nthat may be crowding your mind and causing\n\nstress. This process may result in enhanced\n\nphysical and emotional well-being.\n\nBenefits of meditation\n\nMeditation can give you a sense of calm, peace\n\nand balance that can benefit both your emotional well-being and your overall health. You\n\ncan also use it to relax and cope with stress\n\nby refocusing your attention on something\n\ncalming. Meditation can help you learn\n\nto stay centered and keep inner peace.\n\nAnd these benefits donât end when your meditation session ends. Meditation can help carry\n\nyou more calmly through your day. And meditation may help you manage symptoms of\n\ncertain medical conditions.\n\nMeditation and illness\n\nMeditation might also be useful if you have a\n\nmedical condition, especially one that may be\n\nworsened by stress.\n\nWhile a growing body of scientific research\n\nsupports the health benefits of meditation,\n\nsome researchers believe itâs not yet possible\n\nto draw conclusions about the possible benefits of meditation.\n\nWith that in mind, some research suggests that meditation may help people\n\nmanage symptoms of conditions such\n\nas:\n\nâ¢ Anxiety\n\nâ¢ Asthma\n\nâ¢ Cancer\n\nâ¢ Chronic pain\n\nâ¢ Depression\n\nâ¢ Heart disease\n\nâ¢ High blood pressure\n\nâ¢ Irritable bowel syndrome\n\nâ¢ Sleep problems\n\nâ¢ Tension headaches\n\nBe sure to talk to your health care provider about the pros and cons of using\n\nmeditation if you have any of these conditions or other health problems. In some\n\nrare cases, meditation might worsen symptoms associated with certain mental health\n\nconditions.\n\nMeditation isnât a replacement for traditional medical treatment. But it may be a\n\nuseful addition to your other treatment.\n\nTypes of meditation\n\nMeditation is an umbrella term for the many\n\nways to achieve a relaxed state of being. There\n\nare many types of meditation and relaxation techniques that have meditation components. All share the same goal of achieving inner peace.\n\nWays to meditate can include:\n\nGuided meditation - sometimes called\n\nguided imagery or visualization, with\n\nthis method of meditation you form\n\nmental images of places or situations\n\nyou find relaxing.\n\nYou try to use as many senses as possible, such as smells, sights, sounds and\n\ntextures. You may be led through this\n\nprocess by a guide or teacher.\n\nMantra meditation - in this type\n\nof meditation, you silently repeat a\n\ncalming word, thought or phrase to\n\nprevent distracting thoughts.\n\nMindfulness meditation - this type of meditation is based on being mindful, or having\n\nan increased awareness and acceptance\n\nof living in the present moment.\n\nIn mindfulness meditation, you\n\nbroaden your conscious awareness. You focus on what you\n\nexperience during meditation, such as the flow\n\nof your breath.\n\nYou can observe\n\nyour thoughts\n\nand emot i o n s .\n\nBut let\n\nthem pass\n\nwithout judgment.\n\nQi gong - this\n\npractice generally combines\n\nmeditation, relaxation, physical movement\n\nand breathing exercises to restore and maintain balance. Qi\n\ngong (CHEE-gung) is part of traditional\n\nChinese medicine.\n\nTai chi - this is a form of gentle Chinese\n\nmartial arts training. In tai chi (TIE-CHEE),\n\nyou perform a self-paced series of postures or\n\nmovements in a slow, graceful manner while\n\npracticing deep breathing.\n\nTranscendental meditation transcendental\n\nmeditation is a simple, natural technique. In\n\nthis form of meditation, you silently repeat a\n\npersonally assigned mantra, such as a word,\n\nsound or phrase, in a specific way.\n\nThis form of meditation may allow your\n\nbody to settle into a state of\n\nprofound rest and relaxation and your\n\nmind to achieve a\n\nstate of inner peace,\n\nwithout needing to\n\nuse concentration\n\nor effort.\n\nYo g a - y o u\n\nperform a series\n\nof postures and\n\ncontrolled breathin"
