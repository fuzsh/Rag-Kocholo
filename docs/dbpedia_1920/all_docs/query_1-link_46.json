        "text": "Underage TV doctor, Broadway star, magician - Neil Patrick Harris has played many roles in his career but the actor has now added the role of a lifetime to his off-screen resume, that of a husband.\n\nThe How I Met Your Mother star married longtime partner, celebrity chef, David Burtka on September 6.\n\nThe attached image seems to one from the altar where the stars can be seen saying 'I do' in custom made Tom Ford tuxedos.\n\nThe couple have been in a relationship since 2004 but it was only in 2007, a year after Neil stepped 'out-of-the-closet', that Neil confirmed that they had been in relationship for sometime. They have two children, twins Gideon Scott and Harper Grace, who were born through surrogacy in 2010. The couple are famous for their amazing co-ordinated Halloween costumes too.\n\nNeil, who shot to fame in Doogie Howser MD, and David announced their engagement in 2011 after same-sex marriage became legal in New York state.\n\nAccording to eonline.com, How I Met Your Mother producer and director Pam Fryman, who is a close friend, officiated the ceremony while singer Elton John performed at the reception."
