        "text": "Neil Patrick Harris and David Burtka have been supporting each other since their very first date.\n\nThe couple started out as friends after meeting on a street corner in 2004, though their relationship quickly turned into something more. Harris and Burtka went public with their relationship in 2007, and later welcomed twins Harper Grace and Gideon Scott via surrogate in 2010. Following the 2011 ruling that legalized gay marriage in New York, the couple announced their engagement, and eventually wed in a private ceremony in Italy in 2014.\n\nBetween supporting each other through career changes and cross-country moves, Harris and Burtka have stood by each other through it all. \"I'm simply amazed by this awesome man,\" Harris wrote on Instagram in a birthday tribute for Burtka in 2021. \"David is the glue that holds our family together, the constant provider of meals and compassion, and the funniest, most loving man I know.\"\n\nFrom their celebratory social media tributes to sweet moments on the red carpet, here's everything to know about Neil Patrick Harris and David Burtka's relationship.\n\nApril 1, 2004: Neil Patrick Harris and David Burtka go on their first date\n\nBruce Glikas/FilmMagic\n\nHarris and Burtka went to the movies for their first date on April 1, 2004, after meeting in passing on the street.\n\nIn a 2012 essay written for Out magazine, Burtka shared that he had had a boyfriend when he met the Doogie Howser star, but that the relationship was already on the rocks and ended shortly afterward.\n\nNovember 2006: Neil Patrick Harris comes out to PEOPLE, keeping his relationship with David Burtka private\n\nIn an exclusive interview with PEOPLE, Harris publicly came out as gay in 2006. \"I am a very content gay man living my life to the fullest and feel most fortunate to be working with wonderful people in the business I love,\" he said.\n\nThe interview came two months after season 2 of How I Met Your Mother began airing on CBS.\n\nApril 2007: Neil Patrick Harris confirms relationship without naming David Burtka\n\nA few months after coming out to PEOPLE, Harris confirmed that he was in a relationship on The Ellen DeGeneres Show. In the interview, he spoke to DeGeneres about coming out while maintaining his privacy.\n\n\"I'm not a very scandalous person and so I didn't want to have to respond to some story â€¦ I just made a statement and sort of squashed the fires,\" he said. \"My life had been relatively open in my world. I've been dating the same guy for three years and our families know. We go out together all the time â€¦ I never felt it was an obligation for me to hold pinkies down the red carpet or anything.\"\n\nSeptember 16, 2007: Neil Patrick Harris and David Burtka make their red carpet debut at the Emmy Awards\n\nJeffrey Mayer/WireImage\n\nAfter three years of dating, Harris and Burtka made their first joint red carpet appearance at the 2007 Emmy Awards.\n\nThe 2007 Emmy Awards marked the first of four nominations Harris received for outstanding supporting actor in a comedy series for his role in How I Met Your Mother.\n\nJune 2009: Neil Patrick Harris responds to rumors of starting a family with David Burtka\n\nAs Harris' How I Met Your Mother costars Alyson Hannigan and Cobie Smulders began to expand their families, rumors swirled that Harris and Burtka were thinking of starting their own.\n\n\"We are not currently expecting a baby,\" Harris told PEOPLE in a statement.
