        "text": "I actually think NPH is the one from the cast who'll have a career afterwards.\n\nJason Segall can't go away fast enough, IMHO. And I can't even remember the other guy. Who is, allegedly, the lead.\n\nRemember that guy from SCRUBS? Who was making movies, too, for a while?\n\nI rest my case.\n\nI don't know what will happen to him after this shitty show goes off, but I hope that he does more dramatic roles like he did before this shitty show. He was really good in Clara's Heart and in the TV movies Not Our Son and Snowbound.\n\nI'm just kind of tired of the goofball comedy stuff when he is really good at dramatic roles as well.\n\nI don't see any indication that he is a particularly good adult actor -- he was a child in Clara's Heart. He's awful in the series, although writing and directing surely deserve most of the blame. He loves musical comedy and will probably show up in some revivals or perhaps something new that hits. He's become a self consciously 'quirky' supporting type, epicine rather than femme but without anything that shows range as an actor. He's best sending himself up (Howard and Kumar)or as a host. He's young enough to score another series before it's all over; that's really where his main experience has been, and the small screen seems about right for his ability. But all performing careers are ultimately about luck -- he had a period of bad luck where nothing worked for him and he ran through the Doogie Howser money, then at least had the luck to get into a long running series which has made him a lot of money and also allowed him to springboard into a 'personality', so we'll see...\n\nI've never watched How I Met Your Mother, but a friend showed me Dr. Horrible's Singalong Blog, which was unexpectedly hilarious and apparently has a huge cult following.\n\nAnyway, he's a successful, well spoken, out gay man who by all accounts seems like a nice guy. Why would you WANT him to go away, unless you're a freeper troll who doesn't want gay youths to have positive role models?\n\nAll the musical theatre losers seem to love him. Even though he can't sing. Or dance. And plays the same role over and over again.\n\nWhy are we supposed to worship this guy? Glad he's open about his sexuality but god, do we need such a untalented, whitebread bourgeouis bore as our role model? He makes James van der Beek look edgy.\n\nR12, that's what I think, too. Just very busy. He will have the same kind of career as an English actor considered successful: busy. Smart actors don't measure career success in superstardom. Plus, you never hear any horror stories about him so there seems to be a lot of goodwill towards him in the industry and he's had a front role in two very successful TV shows (even if Doogie was a thousand years ago.) He's bankable. I doubt we'll see him on TV commercials late at night for convection ovens.\n\nI never did like his sissy ass. He is not funny, and doesn't have any particular talent that I can discern. He was not able to play a teenage genius and he most assuredly can't come across as a promiscuous heterosexual. Mayhap he could do a half-way credible job in something like the \"The New Normal\".\n\nWhy not!\n\nWho would ever think that he would have had a career after \"Doogie Hauser\"?\n\nHe was in a wonderful Christmas movie with Debbie Reynolds a few years ago. Totally different from his Doogie and Barney characters.\n\nI think it was called \"A Christmas Wish\" I love it and I recommend it.\n\n[quote]I like NPH but can't believe that POS sitcom of his has lasted this long. Surely one of the worst of TV's longest-running series of all time.\n\nDitto. Can't stand that shitty ass show. I used to like NPH, but I've noticed that he seems to carry his character's cocky persona over into interviews, which makes me not like him much anymore. I wonder if the show has gone to his head or if he just doesn't know when to get out of character. The whole cocky goofball shit is annoying.\n\nHe's the best thing about that wretched sitcom, but talk about damning someone with faint praise. His character is a caricature and a little bit of it goes a long way. How I Met Your Mother is about as good a sitcom as Yes, Dear and yet it lingers around like a foul fart.\n\nR9/10/34 is an awful person who is also extremely old.\n\nPersonally, I don't particularly care for NPH. He's too bland for me.\n\nHowever, one only needs to be paying the bare minimum of attention to current pop culture to realize how well liked he is by the mainstream. He's the kind of actor who will be in the limelight in some way as long as he wants to be. Not to say he'll get the best work, but he will work as long as he wants. There will always be an audience for him.\n\nIf you can't understand this, you don't know much about how the business works.\n\nI think he's tired of being a father. A couple of weeks ago, he said that he liked to get out of the house before the screaming and crying starts and then today on air, he said he was exhausted because his kids kept waking up every two or three hours.\n\nSounds like someone has spoiled them rotten. I say, get a good nanny who will keep them so active during the day, so they will be sleepy at night. Maybe they should send them to their room when they start crying? Who can stand whiny kids? I can't.\n\nHe has got money in the bank. He will probably pack up the brood, move to NYC and spent the next ten years on Broadway as a musical performer, and teh occasional indie film.\n\nSame as what David Hyde Pierce has done.\n\nPlus it is time for his partner to get back on stage. he pretty much gave up his career to support NPH, now it is his turn.\n\nJason Segal has made a few successful movies - Sarah Marshall. Alyson Hannigan has also done a few reasonably successful movies - American Pie.\n\nCobie Smulders is a big question mark - the only notable thing she's done is the fanboy wet dream (minor) role in Avengers.\n\nRadnor is the one least likely to have a career afterwards.\n\nIf he's not constantly fielding offers to work, which I think will be the case, he has enough money he can produce whatever project he wants to work on. Or, if he wants to take a break, he can, indefinitely. He's set for life and never HAS to work another day if he chooses not to.\n\nR74 he loaded up his bank account during his Doogie Howser years.\n\nhe had very good parents who didn't touch his trust. Just like Brian Bloom, he invested his money wisely and only worked when he wanted to.\n\nThat is why during the years between Doogie and HIMYM NPH did tons of regional theater. And wasn't struggling to find work, or be struggle financially.\n\nI'm sure he has enough in the bank to be comfortable, if he does nothing but Broadway for the next decade\n\nJason Segel is a very likable, comely man who will go on to do other things.\n\nEven when he bent over and showed his dirty ass in \"Saving Sarah Marshall\" I was behind him (so to speak).\n\nI think that he will have a pretty good career. He has a certain presence that cannot be denied. He is also rumored to be a very easy actor to work with.\n\nI hope only the best for him."
