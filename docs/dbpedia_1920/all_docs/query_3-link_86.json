        "text": "Now that the Golden Globes have been handed out, it's time to get ready for this year's Oscars. And while the Academy Awards are all about honoring achievements in film from the past year, we all know that the host can make or break the show. So before you head to the movie theatre to check out all the flicks primed to win awards this year, make sure to acquaint yourself with this year's host -- Neil Patrick Harris.\n\nNeil Patrick Harris is an American actor born in Albuquerque, N.M. Harris rose to fame at a young age as a genius, teenaged doctor in \"Doogie Howser, M.D.\" He went on to play Max in \"Capitol Critters\" from 1992 through 1995, and had several guest roles on numerous television series throughout the 1990s. His most recent TV hit, however, was as womanizer Barney Stinson on \"How I Met Your Mother\" from 2005-2014.\n\nHarris also holds several film credits to his name, including roles in \"Starship Troopers\" and David Fincher's \"Gone Girl.\" But Harris is often remembered for playing a hard-partying, parodied version of himself in \"Harold and Kumar Go to White Castle\" and the film's subsequent sequels. Harris also starred in the cult-classic \"Dr. Horrible's Sing-Along Blog\" in 2008.\n\nHarris has made a big name for himself on Broadway, playing Tobias Rag in \"Sweeney Todd\" in 2001, Emcee in \"Cabaret\" in 2003, the Balladeer and Lee Harvey Oswald in \"Assassins\" in 2004, and most recently played the titular role in \"Hedwig and the Angry Inch\" in 2014.\n\nHowever, Harris may be best known for his incredible performances as an awards show host. Harris emceed the Tony Awards in 2009 and again from 2011-2013. Harris also hosted the Primetime Emmy Awards in 2013 and the 2010 Spike Video Game Awards.\n\nHarris is currently married to David Burtka, an actor and chef. The pair have two children together. Harris was awarded a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame in 2011.\n\nThis will be Harris' first year as Oscars host, but judging by his resume, he certainly seems more than qualified to put on a good show."
