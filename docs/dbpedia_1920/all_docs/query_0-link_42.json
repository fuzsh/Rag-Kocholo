Show time both nights is 9:30 PM.\n\nThe musical director is Seth Rudetsky.\n\n\"Director Neil Patrick Harris has taken the conventional cabaret structure and turned it upside down, creating a show unlike anything that has been seen before,\" according to press notes. \"Add the musical direction of Seth Rudetsky and you’re in for something special. Funny yet emotional, energetic yet raw – David Burtka’s concert will be a night to remember at 54 Below.\"\n\nBurtka was last seen on Broadway as Tulsa in the Bernadette Peters revival of Gypsy. A trained chef, he has been seen on screen in \"How I Met Your Mother,\" \"On The Lot\" and \"Crossing Jordan.\"\n\nTickets will go on sale Sept. 25. There is a $50-$90 cover charge and a $25 food and beverage minimum."
