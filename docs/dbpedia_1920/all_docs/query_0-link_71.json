        "text": "NEW YORK — Kim Kardashian and Kanye West aren’t the only ones who tied the knot this year in Italy. So did Neil Patrick Harris and David Burtka.\n\nThe “How I Met Your Mother” star and his actor-chef groom were married Saturday in Italy. They’d been dating for 10 years and are parents to 3-year-old twins, Gideon and Harper. The grooms wore custom Tom Ford tuxedos and Elton John performed at the reception.\n\n“Yup, we put the ‘n’ and ‘d’ in ‘husband,“’ Harris tweeted Monday. His publicist later confirmed the news.\n\nHarris, 41, just won a Tony Award for his role in “Hedwig and the Angry Inch.” He has been in several Broadway productions, including “Assassins,” “Proof” and as the exuberant master of ceremonies in “Cabaret.”\n\nBurtka, 39, played Tulsa in the Bernadette Peters-led revival of “Gypsy,” was seen off-Broadway in “The Play About the Baby” and is also a chef.\n\n“How I Met Your Mother” producer Pam Fryman officiated at the wedding. Same-sex marriages are not allowed in Italy so it was not legally binding in that country.\n\nThe next celebrity couple to pick Italy to marry is George Clooney and human rights lawyer Amal Alamuddin, who will tie the knot in Venice in a couple of weeks."
