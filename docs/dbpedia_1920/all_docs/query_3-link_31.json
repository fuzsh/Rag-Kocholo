        "text": "Welcome to “More Ketchup, Please,” our newest series that’s spilling the beans on all the different ways we cook for, and with, our kids. We've got some great guests stopping by, to get schooled by their little ones on how to perfect family favorites. The more (cooks) the merrier? We think so.\n\nActor and chef David Burtka knows exactly how to throw a great party (as evidenced by his new book Life Is a Party: Deliciously Doable Recipes to Make Every Day a Celebration). One of his secrets for hosting? Involving the whole family. As Burtka says, “Parties should be for everyone, and not just the adults.” Which is why his kids usually make an appearance.\n\nGideon and Harper, Burtkas’s 8-year-old twins with husband Neil Patrick Harris, are regular sous-chefs in the kitchen, whether it’s to whisk batter, pick herbs—or lick egg beaters. While they each have a trademark recipe, it’s their combined forces that have produced the real winners. Like the sweet and salty popcorn with mini meringues, a genius spin on Kettle Corn—so popular it’s now part of the Burtka-Harris family folklore, second only to Burtka’s legendary Bolognese (watch the video for that story).\n\nIn this week’s episode, Burtka and the twins bring their cooking skills to our kitchen, to make not one but three kinds of popcorn—mini meringue, curry butter, and drumroll, please…bacon fat with bacon bits. Because let’s face it, everything tastes better with bacon.\n\n“It’s a popcorn bar!” says Burtka. And if that isn’t a heck of a crowd-pleaser, we don’t know what is.\n\nThe Burtka-Harris Popcorn Bar\n\nWhat’s your favorite recipe to cook with your kids? Tell us in the comments below."
