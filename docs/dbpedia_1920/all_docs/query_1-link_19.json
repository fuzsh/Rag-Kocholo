        "text": "Neil Patrick Harris, the actor who plays one of my favourite characters currently on television – Barney Stinson of How I Met Your Mother – turns 37 today.\n\nHappy birthday and all that jazz, NPH.\n\nBarney is my favourite character on this hilarious sitcom. But I didn’t always love me some Barney.\n\nThe main reason I started watching this show was because Alyson Hannigan (Lily) co-stars. I’ve loved her since her days as geeky nerd turned hot lesbian wicca, Willow Rosenberg, on one af my all-time favourite series, Buffy the Vampire Slayer.\n\nWhile Alyson can’t sing worth a damn – as evidenced in BtVS’s classic 6th season musical extravaganza/episode, ‘Once More, With Feeling’ – her sincere portrayal of Willow (ranging from angst-ridden teenager hiding her crush on her best friend, Xander, in s.1, to vampire-Willow from an alternate dimension in s.3, to her new-found lesbian sexual identity in s.4, to her magical downfall and turn to evil sparked by Tara’s murder in s.6 and her eventual redemption in s.7) was really one of the stand-out performances in a show boasting the talents of Anthony Stewart Head and James Marsters.\n\nThat one time at band camp, when I read she had a regular starring role on a new sitcom (HIMYM) I knew there was no way I was going to skip the show.\n\nI started watching the show and I liked it.\n\nBut Barney initially irritated me with his never-ending shagfest-quest, suit-obsession and catch phrase. Though I did like the actor who portrayed him. I’d heard of Doogie Howser, M.D. but I’d never seen the late 1980’s sitcom, so I had no idea who NPH was. I also didn’t see Harold & Kumar go to White Castle until 2006/7, so I hadn’t seen his hilarious turn as ‘himself’.\n\nHIMYM was my first introduction to NPH and while I didn’t quite like his character at first, I was impressed with his performance. It also doesn’t hurt that I think he’s the most attractive male cast member (normally I’d go for Josh Radnor but his ‘Ted’ is just too annoying). By the end of s.1 I loved Barney. He grew on me and I learned to ignore his catch phrase.\n\nSince my gaydar is constantly offline, it came as somewhat of a surprise when NPH announced in 2007 in People magazine that he was a “content, gay man.” While being gay didn’t change my opinion of him, it certainly endeared him to me even more.\n\nNPH acts, sings and dances, which he proved in a recent episode of Glee (not yet aired on SA screens) and previously also on the fantastic 2008 web-based series, Dr. Horrible’s Sing-a-long Blog.\n\nYet my gaydar didn’t ping once.\n\nI love that he didn’t make a big deal out of his coming out. He only did the People-interview because a “shocking gay scandal” was looming on the horizon and he wanted to set the record straight, so to speak.\n\nBut he wasn’t closeted before the interview. He had been (and still is) in a long-term relationship with actor David Burtka. While David isn’t famous (he mostly does theatre), you may recognise him from his minor role on HIMYM. He appeared in a couple of episodes as Scooter, Lily’s stalker ex-boyfriend. You might remember he tried to get Lily to call of her wedding to Marshall in the s.2 finale."
