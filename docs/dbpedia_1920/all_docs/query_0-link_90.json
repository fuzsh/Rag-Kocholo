        "text": "OpenTable, the online restaurant reservation company, has launched a new service on its website called Tastemaker lists. The lists feature the favorite restaurants of frequent diners, including a number of celebrities.\n\nAmong the first to provide a Tastemaker list are actor Neil Patrick Harris and David Burtka, his husband, who is from Dearborn and grew up in Canton.\n\nHarris and Burtka count two Michigan restaurants among their favorites: Michael Symon’s Roast in the Westin Book Cadillac in downtown Detroit and the Gandy Dancer in Ann Arbor.\n\n“(Roast) isn't your average hotel restaurant,\" they write. \"Michael Simon's Detroit steakhouse is a surefire hit — a place that has it all. Its menu highlights meats of all kinds that pair well with amazingly tasty sides.”\n\nThey cited the Gandy Dancer as “one of Michigan's best restaurants. This place is wonderful for events and big parties. This establishment is known for fine food, which has a menu that focuses on seafood and wonderfully cooked steaks.”\n\nOther spots on Harris and Burtka’s list of favorites are Quince in San Francisco, Momofuko in Las Vegas and Lidia’s Restaurant in Kansas City, Kansas, from acclaimed TV chef Lidia Bastianich. The couple also has a New York City-only restaurant list.\n\nAccording to OpenTable, Harris has a “longstanding passion for all things delicious ... and he’s now seen as an authority on food and dining, too.” Burtka is a chef who graduated from Le Cordon Bleu, started a catering company in L.A. and became a Food Network star.\n\nOther celebrities with lists include TV cooking personalities Christina Tosi and Carla Hall and singer-songwriter Jordin Sparks.\n\nContact food writer Susan Selasky at sselasky@freepress.com or 313-222-6872.
