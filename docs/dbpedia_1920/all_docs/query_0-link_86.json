        "text": "NEW YORK - Kim Kardashian and Kanye West aren't the only ones who tied the knot this year in Italy. So did Neil Patrick Harris and David Burtka.\n\nThe \"How I Met Your Mother\" star and his actor-chef groom were married Sept. 6 in Italy. They had been dating for 10 years and are parents to 3-year-old twins, Gideon and Harper.\n\n\"Yup, we put the 'n' and 'd' in 'husband,'\" Harris tweeted Monday. His publicist later confirmed the news.\n\nThe 41-year-old Harris just won a Tony Award for his role in \"Hedwig and the Angry Inch.\" He has been in several Broadway productions, including \"Assassins,\" ''Proof\" and as the exuberant master of ceremonies in \"Cabaret.\"\n\nBurtka is 39. He played Tulsa in the Bernadette Peters-led revival of \"Gypsy\" and is also a chef."
