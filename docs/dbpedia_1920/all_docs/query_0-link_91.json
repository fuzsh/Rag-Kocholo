        "text": "Where did Neil Patrick Harris spend his husband’s birthday?\n\nAt East Tennessee's very own (and very decadent) Blackberry Farm.\n\nNPH and his actor and chef husband, David Burtka, spent a few days in Walland, Tennessee, to celebrate Burtka’s 44th birthday. They loved it.\n\n\"If there is a heaven, may it please be like @blackberryfarm,\" he wrote on Instagram.\n\nThe actor best known for his role on \"How I Met Your Mother\" and \"Doogie Howser, M.D.\" shared his fly-fishing experience, too. He caught 13 rainbow trout and named the first fish “Dusty.”\n\nDon’t worry, he made sure to tell his viewers that he’s team #catchandrelease.\n\nHarris posted an Instagram photo of the couple on Wednesday, saying “I’m proud of you in so many ways — it’s just a better life when you are in it.”\n\nHarris and Burtka aren’t the first celebrities to find themselves at the farm. The New York Post reported last year that “Modern Family” star Jesse Tyler Ferguson and singer Carrie Underwood have visited the resort in the foothills of the Great Smoky Mountains.\n\nBlackberry Farms describes itself as \"one of the top rated properties in the world.\" It offers guests rooms, suites, cottages and houses. It's super luxurious — for example, a three-bedroom guest house (with meals included) will run you about $5,700 per night.\n\nAnd there is a three-night minimum stay for guests during this time of the year, according to a farm brochure.\n\nGuests can hike, enjoy a wine tasting or relax at the spa. The farm’s site also offers a private paintball course."
