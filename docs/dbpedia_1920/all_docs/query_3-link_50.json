        "text": "David had to quit the show cause while he was on-stage, Neil was sticking his dick in every hole he could find.\n\nThe shorter one is more worried about what the hell he’s going to cook tonight that those bratty kids will actually eat.\n\n“...Neil was sticking his dick in every hole he could find.”\n\nNeil only wants my Dooty Houser.\n\nI stopped following him on twitter but Burtka used to complain endlessly about being stuck home with the kids while Neil was onstage or acting somewhere. Very frauish.\n\nIn his Tony acceptance Harris said next year would be David's year. I guess not.\n\nDavid was so hot and in his youth but he never lost the baby weight. Neil has said he was obsessed with him like many men were after Burtka did that nude Albee play.\n\nNow NPH can have him. Nobody envies him.\n\nI get the impression David is like many stay at home moms, loves that she doesn’t have to work, but resents the husband because he can. Ridiculous.\n\nDavid is one of the naturally dumbest people on the face of the earth. He makes Dora Dumfuck look like Einstein. However, he's very crafty. It's odd how someone could be both; you assume the dumb thing is a put on or a scam, but it's not. It's rather remarkable.\n\nThey are nowhere near as fugly as Pete and her wife.\n\nthat's a really old photo. David is much fatter now and Neil more methy looking.\n\nDavid will emerge from that shadows as NPH struggles with alcoholism and David will win a big award where a drunken Neil accidentally smacks him, but at the podium he will announce himself as “I am Mrs. Neil Patrick Harris!” and the audience will lose its collective shit after an extended period of silence."
