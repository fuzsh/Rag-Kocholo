        "text": "David Burtka is known around the globe for his passion for a good party and ability to keep up in the kitchen.\n\nMeanwhile, his all-singing, all-dancing husband Neil Patrick Harris has made us laugh for decades, and when they come together, they're a force to be reckoned with.\n\nWatch the full story above.\n\nKnow the news with the 7NEWS app: Download today\n\nAfter getting down on one knee, David and Neil tied the knot five years ago, juggling Hollywood and home life as dads to their two children and becoming the envy of parents everywhere.\n\n\"We met on the street,\" Burtka said.\n\n\"We were both doing Broadway shows at the time, and the girl who was playing my wife on the show knew Neil, and he thought I was dating her.\n\n\"But she said, 'No, David's gay.' Then we started hanging out, and that was it. Here we are, 15 years later.\"\n\nThe family are known for their creativity, and they've become famous for their incredible annual Halloween portraits.\n\n\"The kids really like doing the Halloween picture, but we sort of have the final say,\" Burtka said.\n\n\"They give us some options, whether it be Minecraft or Descendants, but we're like, let's get a little more creative than that. So it's a family endeavour.\n\n\"But they also get a chance to be whatever they want for Halloween for trick or treating - so they get two costumes.\"\n\nFrom fashion to furnishing\n\nTheir love for design also extends to the family home - a luxurious New York City townhouse which they remodelled together.\n\nMore on 7NEWS.com.au\n\nWhy Helena Bonham Carter didn't rely on a historian to play Princess Margaret\n\nThese secret Netflix codes will unlock hundreds of Christmas movies\n\nMeet the voice behind some of Disney's biggest hits\n\nGet more entertainment news here\n\n\"I tend to have final say I think,\" Burtka said.\n\n\"Neil trusts me with that, but we really love doing it. He's got some great ideas. We don't just have someone do our house - we really get in there and decorate together, so it's a really fun family job.\n\n\"We're living there, so we have to love it.\"\n\nLife is a party\n\nDavid is now sharing his entertaining expertise in a new book, teaching you how to take your party planning to the next level.\n\nAnd when it comes to hosting a party, David and Neil are a match made in heaven - while he manages the food, Harris takes care of the drinks.\n\n\"A couple of years ago, I got Neil four four-hour lessons with the head bartender at Crown Shy, a famous restaurant here in New York City,\" Burtka said.\n\n\"He learned all the major spirits, and we have a seven-foot bar at our house. So he's able to work all of the cocktails and wines, and I do the food. So it's a nice group effort at our house.\"\n\nTips for Christmas\n\n\"What we need right now is to put our phones down and come together,\" Burtka said.\n\n\"One of my biggest tips is don't do it alone. If someone comes over to your house and they ask what they can do, have a list of things they can do and put them to work.\n\n\"I think people appreciate that. They'll appreciate that they're a part of the meal.\n\n\"It's also nice to let the party go further - don't just have dinner planned. Have a game planned, or a screening planned, or have a little show.\n\n\"Go a little further than you expect to go.\""
