        "text": "Actor Born June 15, 1973 in Albuquerque, N.M.\n\nNeil Patrick Harris is one of the few performers who gained huge acclaim as a child actor, then successfully transitioned to an adult career.\n\nHarris was born to Ruidoso, N.M., restaurateurs Sheila and Ron Harris and got involved in acting at a very young age. His big break came at the age of 15 when playwright Mark Medoff discovered him at a New Mexico drama camp and cast him in his film, âClaraâs Heartâ opposite Whoopi Goldberg. That film earned him his first Golden Globe nomination. The following year, he got the lead role in TV creator Steven Bochcoâs comedy-drama series âDoogie Howser, M.D.â Harrisâ performance as a precocious teenage doctor earned him his second Golden Globe nominations and made him a star. The series ran for four seasons, ending in 1993. After the show ended, Harris made a series of TV guest appearances and appearances in films, including the Paul Verhoeven science fiction action film âStarship Troopersâ in 1997.\n\nHarris began appearing in Broadway productions in 2000, including a concert production of âSweeney Toddâ and a revival of âAssassins.â\n\nIn 2005, Harris joined the ensemble cast of his second big TV hit, the CBS sitcom âHow I Met Your Mother.â The role of Barney, a notorious ladiesâ man, earned Harris multiple Golden Globe and Emmy nominations, but no wins.\n\nDuring the seriesâ run, Harris also came out as a gay man, publicly acknowledging his relationship with actor David Burtka. The couple announced they were expecting fraternal twins through a surrogate mother in 2010.\n\nHarris finally earned his first Emmy in 2010 for his hosting duties on another award show, the Tonys. He also won a creative Emmy for his guest acting spot in \"Glee.\" Harrisâ hosting job (which he repeated in 2011) earned the actor rave reviews and good ratings."
