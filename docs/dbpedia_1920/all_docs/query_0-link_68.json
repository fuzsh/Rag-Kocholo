        "text": "Few performers in show business enjoy the profile of Neil Patrick Harris as a serious actor, comedian, singer, stage director, book author, as well as beloved awards show emcee and TV host. It could be argued that Harris, like Richard Thomas before him on The Waltons, won a career’s worth of audience goodwill for a charming role that positively branded him as a guy you could love when he appeared (at the ripe age of 16) as Doogie Howser, M.D. (1989-1993).\n\nFew young actors have had such early success, and it may have been a hard act to follow. Theater work followed, but Neil Patrick Harris’s first major film role was an unlikely yet memorable one: as one of the commanders in Paul Verhoeven’s spectacular, semi-campy science fiction epic, Starship Troopers (1997), and quickly followed with The Proposition (1998) with Kenneth Branagh, Madeleine Stowe, and William Hurt and John Schlesinger’s The Next Big Thing (2000) with Madonna and Rupert Everett.\n\nMuch of Neil Patrick Harris’s diverse career (he’s even a respected and skilled magician) has been on the American stage and television, including producing and hosting multiple editions of the Tony Awards broadcast, and most prominently as Barney in the long-running sitcom hit, How I Met Your Mother (2005-2014). But his occasional screen roles tend to be memorable, as when he played himself in the groundbreaking cult hit, Harold & Kumar Go to White Castle (2004) with John Cho and Kal Penn and revived the stunt in the sequels, Harold & Kumar Escape from Guantanamo Bay (2008) and A Very Harold & Kumar Christmas (2011).\n\nHarris jumped on the current animation bandwagon early, doing voices in both Phil Lord’s and Christopher Miller’s Cloudy with a Chance of Meatballs (2009) and its 2013 sequel, as well as Cats & Dogs: The Revenge of Kitty Galore (2010). He starred in a live-action/animation mix in The Smurfs (2011) and The Smurfs 2 (2013) and opposite Jim Henson’s legendary puppets in The Muppets (2011)."
