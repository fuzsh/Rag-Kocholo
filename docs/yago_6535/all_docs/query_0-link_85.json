        "text": "Heavy, tedious Turkish arthouse melodrama, The Road is more interesting for its history than in and of itself. Scenarist Yilmaz Güney, an ethnic Kurd, could not film The Road because he was a political prisoner of Turkey’s military regime. Therefore, his assistant, Serif Gören, shot the film. Turkey had had a military coup in 1960 and military interventions in 1971 and 1980.\n\nEach of a group of ethnically diverse prisoners is given a week’s furlough. Each encounters family and related issues. This is a schematic, dull film, not any sort of compelling depiction of political oppression. Turkey has given us beautiful films, among them Dervis Zaim’s Somersault in a Coffin (1996), Nuri Bilge Ceylan’s Kasaba (1997) and Clouds of May (1999), and Yesim Ustaoglu’s Journey to the Sun (1999). The Road does not compare with these.\n\nOn the other hand, it is somewhat better than The Wall (Duvar, 1983), a prison drama that Güney directed on his own."
