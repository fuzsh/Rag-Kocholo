        "text": "Sebastian Argol\n\nYol (Original Soundtrack)\n\nMilan (Switzerland) 1982\n\nA 120 CH 001 (LP)\n\nsleeve : EX-(SOC, wear on edge and corner.)\n\nmedia : EX/EX(some slightly surface noises.)\n\nThe original soundtrack to the Turkish film \"Yol,\" directed by Yilmaz Guney and his assistant Serif Goren and released in 1982. Yilmaz Guney escaped imprisonment and fled to Switzerland with the negative film, which was then edited and released in Paris, France. The music was composed by Sebastian Argol, who is said to be an alias of a well-known composer, although details about this artist are unknown. This is an undiscovered masterpiece that contains very high quality neo-world music throughout the album. The album also contains different versions of the same track, which is common on soundtracks, but the total quality is excellent. The album has a world view similar to that of Luis Delgado and Luis Paniagua, the Spanish experimental/ambient music giants, and is highly recommended.\n\nA4: The Bodies\n\nB5: To The Unknown"
