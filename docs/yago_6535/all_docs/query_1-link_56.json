        "text": "“The Kurdish Cinema created its hero before it was founded. ” — Mihemed Aktaş\n\nThe fire of the Kurdish cinema began to blaze with the documentary Grass: A Nation Battle’s for Life (1925) and continued with the film Zarê (1925), and the documentary Kurd-Êzîdî (Yezidi-Kurds 1932–3)[1]. And then it died out. The Kurds remained hidden in the cinema for a quite long time, just as they were hidden in the world. It was a long time before Kurdish cinema reached Yılmaz Güney. And this time passed with a weak political environment. In that era, the Kurds were unvoiced through genocide, murder, plunder, and exile. Once in every four parts of Kurdistan a political light came out and began to spread, Yılmaz Güney took the stage, and Kurdish cinema developed with him.\n\nThe issue of belongingness of a movie or a person for the Kurdish cinema is a long story. This discussion includes Yılmaz Güney as well. It can be said that the prominent discussion of this issue is about Yılmaz Güney and his belongingness to the Kurdish cinema. We know that Yılmaz Güney is Kurd and he was in the struggle of the Kurds and Kurdistan case just after he broke out of the prison and fled to Europe. In his own words “We want to be the children of an independent, democratic and united Kurdish country, Kurdistan, not the children of a colonial country that is occupied from all sides… Long live independent, united, and democratic Kurdistan!”. However, when the turn comes to the language of his movies, they are all in Turkish even the one that is taken in France, The Wall. One does not know how to solve this issue. Perhaps we will never solve it, but always discuss on. Should there always be a result of every discussion?[2]\n\nI will shortly focus on the three admirable movies of Yılmaz Güney; Hope (1970), the Herd(1979), and Yol (1982). These three movies are already the basis of Yılmaz Güney’s cinema.\n\nUmut, Hope (1970), is one of the best movies of Yilmaz Guney. Cabbar is an arabesque poor living in Adana. He wants to live a wealthy life like that bourgeois of time which he is unquestionably far away from. The only solution for him is the lottery. In modern society, Cabbar continues his life by working a cart. Of course, the first scene is highly valuable because while Cabbar is on the cart, there is a train in front of him. The contradictions of the contemporary industry are well illustrated.\n\nCabbar’s horse dies in an accident and incomparable despair ensues in him. Cabbar always wants to get rid of his hard-earned living but he can’t, he can’t get it. Of course, he borrows money from some of his friends. But he cannot pay it back. Thereafter, he wants to buy another horse. And to earn some easy money he enters into a robbery plan, but it fails. Once more, to easily get money, he goes in search of a treasure. But despite his effort, he does not succeed.\n\nIf we compare Yılmaz Güney’s Cabbar performance with his previous ones, we can realize that there is an apparent improvement. This time he is no longer a powerful hero, that is unable to solve everything with his weapon at once. Yılmaz Güney was imprisoned for one year and six months before the movie Hope. Transformations occur in his cinema and acting. He says in his own words:\n\n“But I definitely did not know what was communism at that time… I had read nothing in terms of science. My sentence and my first incarceration with unparalleled suffering was an elementary school for me. When I was imprisoned I said this to myself: you are going to stay here for one and a half years. You also have six months in exile. Prepare a program for yourself, first write a novel. Then you call yourself a socialist and you are sentenced for it. At least you must learn what it is. When you go out the prison, you are going to get involved with the cinema, think about your goals, and make them clear. “[3]\n\nSürü, The Herd (1979) movie was shot at a very difficult time. The political situation, in 1971, was awful that everyone was anticipating a military coup. In 1973, the political conjuncture was improving, that is why Yılmaz Güney was released. However, he was arrested again in 1974 on a charge against him. He again maintained to work on cinema in prison. Thus, in 1979, he wrote the scenario of the Herd, and Zeki Ökten directed the movie.\n\nTo say with Yılmaz Güney’s words, this movie is the story of his mother’s family and tribe.[4] The Herd is about animal traders. They go from Kurdistan to Ankara to sell their herd. The difficult road between Ankara and Kurdistan is also the cornerstone of the Kurdish question. They have been deprived of a good society, culture, art, and economy. The Herd begins with a sign of peace between the two Kurdish tribes. Thereafter, women milk, make tandoori bread and collect wood from the valley. And all these are shown without romanticization. Women and men, in different clothes and costumes, each is shown very beautifully. Similarly, the wild nature of Kurdistan is cinematized.\n\nThis film becomes the first Yilmaz Güney film that explicitly covers the life of the Kurds and the question of the existence of Kurds in North Kurdistan.\n\nHemo’s wife Bêrîvan is from the Khalîlxanîyan tribe. Since the beginning of their marriage, she has not had children. Hemo already does not like Khalilkhanis, and his wife, as a Khalilkhani woman, could not bear a child either. He, therefore, feels oppressed by the woman. Feeling angry about it, he attacks his surroundings. This is a symbol of the conflicts of Kurdish culture, the basis of which goes back to the patriarchal system. The ignorance the Kurds are left in is politically illustrated by these examples.\n\nThe shepherds enter the city road after the first scene. Bribery and greedy government officials keep the sheep in dirty and broken wagons along the way. They are constantly on the brakes to break the legs of the sheep. And some of the sheep die because of the dirt and misery. Thieves steal some sheep from the poor shepherds during the travelling. We can say that while the herd that was brutally loaded on the wagons symbolizes the Kurds, the officers who suddenly braked symbolize the blocking of the Kurds. The thieves who explicitly steal sheep also clearly represent the Kurds’ situation of being without status. The Herd ends with a display of several symbols of state power in Ankara.\n\nThe Herd ends and Yilmaz Güney is still in prison. Then, he escaped from prison in 1981. This escape reminds us of his action movies.\n\nYol (The Way), 1982. At that time, a coup took place in Turkey. Thereafter, a great oppression era begins first in northern Kurdistan and then spreads to the entire Turkey. Even though this movie was produced in such an era, there were not many problems in terms of filming.\n\nThe movie begins with 5 prisoners getting out of a Turkish prison for a holiday. We know for sure that these five prisoners are Kurds. Moreover, it illustrates that the western cities of Turkey of that period were like a prison or, better to say, a prison itself for the Kurds. Yol (The Way) focuses on many social, psychological, and political issues. It also strongly opposes the patriarchy.\n\nOur five inmates are released for holiday for a week. However, it is seen that none of them is really free. They get out of a physical prison but get into an authoritarian prison of the society and state. This reality is shown to the audiences through the problems that they face along the way. Hamid Naficy conceptualizes this issue as “Regime Controlled Cinematics”.[5] This issue is described via small claustrophobic rooms of train wagons that the prisoners, in these narrow and small places, talk in whispers to not to be heard by anyone. The signs and symbols of the prison are always standing over them.\n\nOne of the first prisoners, Ûsiv, is arrested by the police because he loses his permission certificate. Ûsiv is shown for a short time. In his last scene, he is like a bird falling into a cage. He is watching outside at a free bird. It is obvious that he will never be free again.\n\nMewlûd goes to Riha to see his fiancée. But the girl’s family does not leave them alone even for a moment. This is another metaphor of a prison created by the state and society. Apart from this, Yilmaz Güney focuses on the patriarchal Kurdish culture from a negative perspective. This is also evident in the conversations between Mewlûd and his fiancée. His fiancée humiliates him with her words and Mewlûd goes to the brothel as an indication of punishment. Mewlûd says that he will never go back to the prison but he lives in the prison that he builds up for himself.\n\nMihemed is remorseful for his past deeds and actions and he sees himself as responsible for the murder of his brother. Whatever he does, he cannot make his father-in-law and his family forgive him. Yet, his wife Emine forgives him and they run away. But the revolt of Mihemed and his wife Emina which begins with the escape ends in the train. Emina’s brother comes, kills them both in the name of honour.\n\nWhen Seyîd was released from prison, he learned that his wife, Zînê, had deceived him and violated his honour. Since he loves his wife, cannot kill her and cannot give her up either. He takes her to the top of the cold and snowy mountains and leaves her to die. He carries her (this scene is also present in The Hope, Şivan carries Berivan) and leads her to the top of the mountain. During carrying her, Zinê seems a heavy load to him. Zînê’s death becomes such a burden for Seyîd that his heart sinks under this remorse. She rebelled against patriarchy but eventually died. Because Seyîd is a coward, he cannot rise against the old traditions. He goes back to the prison again by train. The prison of society is more difficult for him than the actual prison.\n\nAnd our last character Emer is full of a free spirit. While in prison, he dreams about Ebuzer. Ebuzer is free in the gardens and orchards of Kurdistan. Emer goes to Entab and sees a large sign and writes “Kurdistan” on it. When Emer comes to Kurdistan, he changes himself in every aspect. He is now free and has no intention of returning to prison. The nature of Kurdistan is shown in these long scenes. Everything is free in Emer’s eyes; birds, dogs, and goats around. Freedom spreads from the stages. Soon after, with the gunshot sound, everything changes and another prison begins. Then his brother Ebuzer is killed and according to Kurdish customs, Emer should protect and take care of his brother’s wife and children. Thus another prison begins. Yet among these five people, only Emer does not accept his fate and goes towards the mountain in the last scene. In Marxist terms, Emer achieves “political consciousness.”\n\nWith his film Yol (The Way), Yilmaz Güney portrays Turkey as a great prison. Of course, the state has built up prisons to hide this fact or to keep those who reveal it. The Kurds live a life of imprisonment because of the ignorance and lack of education they are left in. Yilmaz Güney focuses on the Kurdish issue in his latest works in cinema aesthetically and successfully. Even though Yılmaz Güney’s films and personality are highly related to his Kurdishness, there cannot be seen a pointed up nationalism as a content of his films. The Herd and Yol movies show the symbols of Kurds, that is the mountains of Kurdistan, in a positive atmosphere but his films are realistic from all aspects and they indicate the statelessness and uneducatedness of an oppressed people.\n\nWhat a correct expression is Muhammet Aktaş’s words: “The Kurdish Cinema created its hero before it was founded.”\n\nNivîskar: Mehmud Beyto\n\n[1] Director: Amasi Martirosyan. Kürt Sineması: Yurtsuzluk, Sınır ve Ölüm p. 51. Û Rediscovering Kurdistan’s Culture And Identities: The Call of Cricket, Joanna Bochenska. p. 267. Û Gotara Mustafa Gündoğduyî, Film Festivals and the Diaspora: Impetus to the Development of Kurdish Cinema.\n\n[2] My opinion in this case: Each movie should be defined according to the circumstances of its time. Besides, if the director of the movie (the owner of the movie) introduces herself/himself as a Kurd and propagate her/his movie with this awareness, then, I think it is a part of the Kurdish cinema. In this case, the language, the place, the production, and the cinematography is not very crucial. We, as a subjugated nation of a country with no borders, no state, and no status, must not limit ourselves. Doesn’t that sound ironic to you either that we, as a nation without borders, set boundaries, in cinema, in an international art? If the owner of the film made it belonging to the Kurds, it must belong to Kurdish Cinema. If the owner of the film made it belonging to the Kurds, then it must belong to Kurdish Cinema.\n\n[3] Yilmaz Guney, İnsan, Militan ve Sanatçı (Human, Militant and Artist) 1981, p. 18\n\n[4] From an interview with Yilmaz Güney.
