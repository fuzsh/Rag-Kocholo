        "text": "IN ''The Wall,'' which opens today at the Public Theater, the camera's eye views a prison in Ankara, Turkey, the way a scientist might scrutinize an anthill. It creates an odd clinical detachment that is effective in showing the dehumanization of the prisoners. The camera frames shots through bars or barbed wire. It peers down from above, through the edges of broken bottles placed atop walls to discourage escape. The view takes in several courtyards at once, revealing the curious human specimens scurrying about in frantic social interaction. It is an appropriate technique to re-create the sense of claustrophobic helplessness associated with imprisonment.\n\nBut Yilmaz Guney, the Turkish director and political exile who died in 1984, only three years after escaping from a Turkish prison and settling in France, is not satisfied with an overview. He also uses the camera like a microscope, moving in for close-ups that show with stark, uncompromising brutality the agonies of individual prisoners and, through them, the injustices of Turkish prison life.\n\nNo one who saw ''Midnight Express,'' a film about a young American jailed in Turkey for possession of marijuana, would expect a movie about a Turkish prison to be light-hearted. It is a story of hopeless misery. Inmates are separated into dormitories - the women (including some of their children who are born and raised in the prison), the anarchists, and the boys who inhabit Dormitory 4, the children's section. These boys are the focus of the film. They are the weakest members of the prison community and the most brutally treated. Their dormitory has no heating, little water for washing, not enough food, and guards who bully, beat and sexually molest the young inmates. Since bribery is the only way to procure basic necessities, and most of the boys are penniless orphans, their lot is the worst in the prison. They are prey both to sadistic guards and to marauding gangs of prisoners. The boys are so conditioned by prison life, their vision so circumscribed by confinement, that when they look longingly at the moon and pray to God for help, they don't pray for freedom, but to be transferred to a better jail.\n\nIt is a powerful, moving and disturbing film. At its center lies not only Mr. Guney's passion to tell the truth as he sees it, but also his belief in the power of film to make a difference. This reflects a kind of naivete that is touching but depressing. He uses the film as a cry for help, seeming to believe that it can inspire or convert people or galvanize action that will produce change. But these kinds of films - sincere, well-intentioned, so painful and serious that they are difficult to watch - usually wind up preaching only to the converted."
