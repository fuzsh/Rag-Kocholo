        "text": "Yilmaz Guney (far right) in The Friend (1975)\n\nOf all the screenings to be excited about this weekend (such as Block Cinema’s invaluable revival of Love Streams), the one I’m anticipating most is the double feature that kicks off Doc Films’s Yilmaz Güney series on Saturday afternoon. One of the key figures in the history of Turkish cinema, Güney was a successful movie star (he acted in over 100 films), one of the first Turkish directors to be celebrated abroad (his penultimate work, Yol—which plays in Doc’s series on February 23—shared the top prize at Cannes in 1982), and his far-left politics made him a polarizing cultural figure. He was jailed three times—the second for harboring guerilla fighters, the last for murdering a judge—but continued to write movies in prison and direct them by proxy. J. Hoberman once described him as a combination of Clint Eastwood, James Dean, and Che Guevara."
