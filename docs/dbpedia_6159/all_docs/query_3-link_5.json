        "text": "PRTG comes with the whole kit and caboodle\n\nPRTG is a professional all-in-one monitoring tool. It includes all the functions you’ll need for comprehensive network monitoring. And when it comes to costs, PRTG licenses are both fair and transparent. With ManageEngine OpManager, you’re stuck with the cumbersome task of selecting modules. And if you need an upgrade, you’ll have to pay for it. With PRTG, you simply choose the license that best suits the size of your network and the number of things you wish to monitor. Besides OpManager, ManageEngine offers other products such as Application Manager for application monitoring or the service desk software ServiceDesk Plus.\n\nIf you decide on OpManager, you’ll have to think about exactly which functionalities are worth the extra cost before you go through with the purchase.\n\nMonitoring that doesn’t break the bank\n\nDespite its comprehensive range of features, PRTG is extremely affordable. When you put together a software package with ManageEngine OpManager, the purchase price can quickly go through the roof. And this price will, of course, have to be approved beforehand by your higher-ups.\n\nMany of our customers have enjoyed significant savings by switching from ManageEngine OpManager to PRTG.\n\nScenario 1: Monitoring several locations from one central IT environment\n\nPRTG remote probes make it easy to monitor distributed networks.\n\nSimply install the PRTG Core Server in your main network. Remote probes will gather your monitoring data and send this data back to the Core Server for analysis. These probes can be in the same network or in different locations. The only requirement is that they be able to communicate uninterruptedly with the Core Server via the Internet.\n\nScenario 2: Monitoring customers as an MSP\n\nWith a PRTG license, you can also offer monitoring services to your customers. PRTG lets you monitor the networks of several customers, and thereby provide maximum security at minimal cost.\n\nA comprehensive role and rights management system allows you to decide which parts of the monitoring they can access.\n\nAs a sysadmin, you'll save the most time when your monitoring software is easy to configure and operate.\n\nWith PRTG, sensors and evaluation parameters can be added with just a few clicks. Thanks to automatation of search queries and easy-to-understand setup instructions, PRTG is ready to use in no time at all. Graphs such as the “Sunburst View” let you determine the status and performance of your network at a glance.\n\nNot only do our customers find our tool to be extremely user-friendly and intuitive, but independent tests also demonstrate the outstanding usability of PRTG. In comparison to alternative monitoring tools such as ManageEngine OpManager, PRTG always ranks as the most user-friendly software.\n\nPRTG tested by PCmag.com\n\nPRTG tested by ITPro\n\nYou can find the answers to many of your questions already in our how-to guides, manual, knowledge base, and video tutorials.\n\nEach PRTG subscription includes access to the latest PRTG version including new features and security improvements, as well as comprehensive technical support.\n\nIf you’d rather call our technical helpline, we’ll be happy to help. At Paessler, we place great importance on providing efficient Tier 1 support. As a result, your inquiries are usually answered by our software experts within 24 hours on business days."
