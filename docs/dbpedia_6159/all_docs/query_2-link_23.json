        "text": "Hello all,\n\nFor weeks I have been trying to set up my PRTG instance to monitor our MX bandwidth (or in fact, any sensor!) and failing miserably.\n\nI've enabled SNMP in Organization>Settings, enabled SNMP Traps in Alerts, and opened the port in the firewall but whatever I do I cannot get the PRTG instance to register that the devices exist expect for the default ping sensor. I've tried following the instructions in the Meraki KB article on the subject, (https://documentation.meraki.com/General_Administration/Monitoring_and_Reporting/SNMP_Overview_and_C...) but PRTG still cannot communicate with any of my devices.\n\nI am really confused where Meraki says \"by default Meraki devices cannot be polled via SNMP from outside the local IP network\" but yet earlier in the documentation it says that the hostname for all SNMP requests should be \"snmp.meraki.com\" so I can't see how those two statements can match up?\n\nEither way, using the MIB file downloaded from the portal and uploaded into the PRTG system, or using the built-in MIB's doesn't work and I just get errors. I've even tried to test the devices from a PC within the network by using Paessler SNMP Tester. This is what I get each time:\n\n06/04/2022 14:41:01 (4 ms) : Device: snmp.meraki.com\n\n06/04/2022 14:41:01 (7 ms) : SNMP v3\n\n06/04/2022 14:41:01 (9 ms) : Walk -v2c -t 10 -c meraki 10.0.0.252:161\n\n06/04/2022 14:41:01 (168 ms) : Error: -2007\n\nDoes anyone in the community successfully monitor their Meraki install using PRTG or similar?"
