Runs on Windows Server.\n\nZabbix A free monitoring service for networks, servers, and applications that provides SNMP-based live monitoring plus capacity forecasting. Available for Linux, macOS, and Unix.\n\nPRTG presents an easy-to-understand hierarchical view of a network, generates an exhaustive set of reports and even gives plenty of alerts, so you can always stay on top of what is going on in your system.\n\nThough PRTG comes with many interesting features, there are some downsides to it as well. Firstly, it is quite expensive.\n\nThe exact price depends to a large extent on the number of sensors you use. The first 100 sensors are free, and it costs\n\n$1600 for 500 sensors\n\n$2850 for 1000 sensors\n\n$5,950 for 2500 sensors\n\n$10,500 for 5000 sensors\n\n$14,500 for unlimited sensors in one core installation\n\n$60,000 for unlimited sensors in five core installations.\n\nThe above pricing clearly shows that PRTG is expensive and hence, is not ideal for all organizations.\n\nThe Best PRTG Alternatives\n\nBesides cost, there are also a few other things that can be a spot of bother. Adding and removing sensors or moving devices from one group to another can be quite a hassle. Also, it provides only limited support for Windows 10. If any of these downsides are likely to impact you, it makes sense to look for alternatives to PRTG.\n\nMethodology for selecting the Best PRTG Alternatives for Network Monitoring\n\nMany organizations look for PRTG Alternatives for Network Monitoring for it is quite expensive, may not scale well for larger networks, and is also complex to configure. It does provide real-time monitoring of network devices and other benefits, yet most users prefer PRTG Alternatives. To make it easier for you to choose the best one, we have listed a few methodologies that you must consider before finalizing the software.\n\nMake sure that your selected product can keep track of networks, servers, as well as applications\n\nCheck if the network autodiscovery feature is available\n\nMake sure to check if your selected product offers an automated network topology mapper\n\nCheck if your tool is compatible with different operating systems.\n\nDoes it offer free add-ons to extend the functionality of the original software?\n\nCan you track the health performance and run network traffic analysis with the selected product?\n\nDoes it send instant alerts related to performance and resource availability?\n\nDoes it send a notification by email or SMS on detecting an issue?\n\nCheck if your selected tool provides a money-back guarantee or free trials.\n\nRelated Post: Best Storage Monitoring and Management Software\n\nLet’s take a detailed look into the features of each of these products to help you make the right choice, along with some screenshots and download links to get you started right away if you wish to move on.\n\n1. Auvik Network management – FREE TRIAL\n\nAuvik Network Management is a similar package to the PRTG Network Monitor’s SaaS version. The Auvik platform installs an agent on each monitored site and that module scans the network to discover all devices.\n\nKey Features\n\nA continuous network discovery cycle that identifies all devices connected to the network and can spot rogue devices\n\nAutomated network documentation processes that include hardware inventory\n\nGenerates a network map based on the data in the inventory\n\nNetwork device status tracking through the Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP)\n\nAlerts for device component failure\n\nNetwork traffic monitoring with NetFlow, IPFIX, sFlow, and J-Flow\n\nOpportunities for manual traffic analysis\n\nStored metrics for capacity planning\n\nIdentification of peaks and troughs in network demand\n\nAble to monitor WANs\n\nTracing of connections between sites and cloud platforms\n\nNetwork configuration image archiving\n\nA repeated network configuration check that will detect unauthorized changes\n\nA Web-based dashboard that can be accessed from anywhere through any standard browser\n\nWhy do we recommend it?\n\nBeing a SaaS platform, most of the operations of the Auvilk Network Management system take place on the cloud. This means that you don’t have to allocate server space in order to run the software and you can set the package up quickly to monitor multiple networks and the internet connections between them.\n\nWho is it recommended for?\n\nThis platform is suitable for any business that runs a network. However, the charging structure for the package makes it particularly interesting for large companies. This is because there is no accounting for the number of endpoints on a site or the number of sites monitored in one account – the charge is the same.\n\nSystem requirements:\n\nThis package is delivered from the cloud and so it can be accessed through any standard Web browser.\n\nPros:\n\nNetwork discovery that repeats and spots layout changes or new equipment\n\nDetection of rogue devices\n\nNetwork configuration management that identifies settings changes\n\nRoutine device status checking\n\nNetwork traffic analysis\n\nCons:\n\nNeed to make contact for a price list\n\nThe Auvik Network Management platform is available for a 14-day free trial.\n\nEDITOR'S CHOICE\n\nAuvik Network Management is our top pick for a PRTG alternative because it bears a lot of similarities to PRTG. This is a cloud platform – which is one of the delivery options for PRTG. Like its rival, the Auvik package implements network discovery and compiles a hardware inventory. The discovery process can reveal unauthorized devices connected to the network. The routine repeats periodically and it will automatically update the network inventory if a device has been added, moved, or removed. The package provides a network map, which is generated from the data in the hardware inventory. So, when the hardware inventory updates, the map does too. The network monitoring service includes an SNMP-based device monitor that checks for system hardware problems. The other main service in the package is a network traffic analyzer, which uses NetFlow, sFlow, J-Flow, and IPFIX flow protocols to gather data throughput information from switches and routers. The package also provides a network configuration manager – a service that PRTG doesn’t provide.\n\nDownload: Get a 14-day FREE Trial\n\nOfficial Site: https://www.auvik.com/features/#trial\n\nOS: Cloud-based\n\n2.
