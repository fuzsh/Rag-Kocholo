        "text": "Paessler introduces solution for large IT infrastructures, which includes Martello software for a service-oriented central overview across all PRTG servers.\n\nOttawa, Canada (April 21, 2020) – Martello Technologies Group Inc., (“Martello” or the “Company”) (TSXV:MTLO), a leading provider of solutions that deliver clarity and control of complex IT environments, announced today that partner, Paessler AG, is launching PRTG Enterprise Monitor for businesses that need to monitor large IT infrastructures. The new solution includes the ITOps Board (Martello iQ), which is powered by Martello Technologies.\n\nWith the new PRTG Enterprise Monitor, Paessler offers a subscription-based licensing model tailored to large IT environments, licensed only by the number of sensors that are deployed across as many servers and locations as required, starting at 30,000 sensors.\n\nPRTG Enterprise Monitor includes the ITOps Board, powered by Martello Technologies, which enhances the PRTG setup with a service-oriented, central overview, also across multiple PRTG servers. It significantly reduces alert noise and adds advanced analytics and overall Service Level Agreements (SLAs) monitoring and reporting.\n\n“With Paessler PRTG Enterprise Monitor we are enhancing PRTG with central, service-oriented dashboards and a flexible subscription-based licensing model which is ideal for horizontal scaling. Combining this with all the benefits of classic PRTG like the ease of use, the simple licensing, and the broad feature set, PRTG Enterprise Monitor offers a powerful and affordable solution to monitor large IT environments in a lean and easy way,” said Helmut Binder, CEO of Paessler. “This way we continue to support our existing customer base with their growing network sizes and demands. And we offer a monitoring solution with unprecedented feature set, usability and licensing for enterprise level IT teams.”\n\n“Martello’s software gives large enterprises a service-oriented central overview across multiple PRTG instances with advanced analytics, which reduces alert noise and improves SLA management,” said John Proctor, President and CEO of Martello Technologies. “By offering Martello analytics in PRTG Enterprise Monitor, Paessler has a robust solution that is ideal for the challenges of large IT environments.”\n\nMartello and Paessler announced their strategic partnership in February 2019 to offer a consolidated view of all IT systems from a single dashboard using the Martello iQ software. Together, they offer a solution that integrates comprehensive, advanced IT infrastructure monitoring and analytics in their offerings to help prevent downtime and critical IT systems.\n\nRelated Resources:\n\nITOps Board\n\nAbout Martello\n\nMartello Technologies Group Inc.
