        "text": "The use of probes could look like this:\n\nHow to extend monitoring to Linux?\n\nUp to now, you have been limited to hardware running the Windows operating system for using probes. But this changes with the multi-platform probe, which can be installed on other operating systems besides Microsoft. These include Linux operating systems such as Ubuntu, Debian and Redhat Enterprise.\n\nFurthermore, this probe can be installed on ARM-based devices, such as Raspberry Pi, and also on Docker.\n\nHere are the supported platforms in detail:\n\nHow to install the multi-platform probe in 3 steps?\n\nTo install multi-platform probes, you must first prepare your systems to support the connection to the PRTG core server:\n\nStep 1: Install a NATS server\n\nThe NATS server handles the exchange of data between multi-platform probes and a PRTG core server.\n\nStep 2: Configure the connection in PRTG\n\nOnce you have installed a NATS server, you need to configure your PRTG setup. This involves a two-step process where you\n\n- configure the connection between the NATS server and the PRTG core server via a probe adapter and\n\n- enter the access keys of all multi-platform probes.\n\nStep 3: Multi-platform installation\n\nOnce you have set up your PRTG core server to support connections to multi-platform probes, you can create as many multi-platform probes as you need.\n\nDepending on the platform on which you are installing the probe, the installation process may vary. Therefore, we have created a manual that details installation steps based on platform. You can download it here:\n\nðŸ‘‰ Multi-platform probe - Comprehensive monitoring for Linux systems\n\nAlternatively, you can watch the following video, where our colleague Felix shows you step by step how to install and configure the multi-platform probe on Linux.\n\nWhat monitoring options does this probe offer?\n\nBy using the multi-platform probe, you have a variety of sensors at your disposal to implement a wide range of monitoring scenarios.\n\nSensors that can be used include the following:\n\nWhat development is planned for the future?\n\nWe are constantly working on expanding the range of functions for the multi-platform probe. This includes support for PRTG Hosted Monitor, and simplifying the installation process by supporting deployment via the RPM package manager and Docker containers for easy, platform-independent implementation.\n\nFor the multi-platform probe release notes, please see this Knowledge Base article:\n\nðŸ‘‰ What are the release notes for the multi-platform probe?\n\nWe'd love to hear your feedback!\n\nTo better understand your needs, we are collecting feedback through a survey to help us develop some of our new features, and would love to hear your opinions."
