        "text": "Guys,\n\nI am looking for suggestions or recommendations for reliable and easy-to-use SNMP software. We are in the process of installing (3) licensed microwave radio hops. Besides the remote access into the microwave itself, we would also like to be notified via SNMP immediately if certain alarms occur.\n\nTo my understanding on SNMP ready devices that support a Trap Address feature, this is where you would enter the IP Address of the SNMP Server. Then in the event of an alarm the device will send the alarm to the server. I understand that the server can also periodically poll the devices to grab information. I would rather only be notified in the event of particular alarms.\n\nI would like the software to have a feature to send out an e-mail to specified addresses when alarms occur. If I need to write custom software to handle that task, I can.\n\nI would prefer the SNMP application to be Windows-based, however if there are any highly recommended ones that are compatible with Red Hat Linux 9.0 Professional I will entertain those as well.\n\nI am new to this so forgive my lack of knowledge.\n\nThanks in advance,\n\nMatt\n\nThanks.\n\nI just downloaded it and tested it on an SM. Is it possible to configure PRTG NOT to poll the devices and simply sit and “listen” for traps when they are sent?\n\nLike I said I would prefer not to have to poll the devices in order to discover events. I would just rather be notified by a Trap to the Server when an alarm occurs.\n\nAny suggestions?\n\nNagios can be configured to receive traps from the SNMP tools via a passive check.\n\nFrom the docs:\n\nPassive checks are useful for monitoring services that are:\n\n* located behind a firewall, and can therefore not be checked actively from the host running Nagios\n\n* asynchronous in nature and can therefore not be actively checked in a reliable manner (e.g. SNMP traps, security alerts, etc.)\n\nSee here: http://nagios.org/faqs/viewfaq.php?faq_id=29\n\nand here: http://www.snmptt.org/\n\nThat should get you started.\n\nI have spent most of today trying to decide on an option. I like PRTG, the only problem is that I cannot get the manufacturer’s MIB to successfully convert to an OID Library using the tool available on the PRTG web site.\n\nI tried another Windows Free-ware option that just listens to SNMP Traps. It says that this version no longer supports e-mail notifications.\n\nI need an SNMP Trap Receiver that can send alerts. Preferably I would like a solution that will allow me to run a batch or executable file on the local PC that I can custom code myself to pesonalize who receives the e-mails and text messages.\n\nAnything else come to mind?"
