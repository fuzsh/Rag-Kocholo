        "text": "Product Overview\n\nPRTG Network Monitor is an on-premise software that allows IT teams to monitor their entire infrastructure, including databases, applications, servers and LANs. Users can visualize their networks with real-time maps and get alerts if there’s disruption within the network or other major issues.\n\nPRTG Network Monitor uses sensors for monitoring the network, which is described as a single metric that users can monitor on a device (e.g., a machine’s CPU load, a port, a specific URL or the traffic of a network connection). Some of the common sensor types include bandwidth monitoring sensors, cloud services sensors and Internet of Things (IoT) sensors. Users can configure the sensors to fit their needs.\n\nSome key benefits of the software are:\n\nA free version for users with limited monitoring needs\n\nCustomizable functionality\n\nAll-inclusive features without additional downloads or plugins\n\nNote that there’s the PRTG Enterprise Monitor for teams that need to monitor larger infrastructures. Some of its features are maps and dashboards, alert management, SLA modeling and scalability for distributed environments.\n\nFeatures\n\nHere are some of the key features of PRTG Network Monitor.\n\nMultiple user interfaces – Users can access PRTG Network Monitor on a web browser, deploy it on their desktops (i.e., PRTG Desktop app) or download its mobile app. All the interfaces has SSL security for local and remote access, and users can access the multiple interfaces simultaneously.\n\nAlerts – There are 10 built-in notification methods, such as email or text, and users can also create their own alert systems. They can schedule the alerts based on triggers or priority (e.g., only sending high-priority alerts after business hours).\n\nCluster failover – PRTG Network Monitoring defines a cluster as two or more core servers that form together. Each cluster typically has at least two nodes – a master node and a failover node. If a master node gets disconnected or is down, the failover node takes over monitoring the sensors and sending alerts. This ensures that users have minimal or no service disruptions.\n\nDistributed monitoring – This feature enables users in multi-site locations to monitor networks for each location. They can deploy remote probes that monitor the specific network and reports any results back to the core server.\n\nMaps and reports – Users can create maps with the drag-and-drop editor, and they can choose from over 300 map objects or create their own. The maps can be shared with internal or external teams via an unique URL. Users can also set up reports that can be exported in PDF, CSV, XML or HTML formats or sent on a daily, weekly or monthly schedule.\n\nTarget Market\n\nPRTG Network Monitoring is targeted to organizations of all sizes and industries. We’ve listed 10 of its clients below.\n\nImplementation/Integration\n\nUsers can download the unlimited version of the software as a 30-day free trial.
