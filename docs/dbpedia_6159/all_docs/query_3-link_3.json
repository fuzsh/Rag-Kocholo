        "text": "Notice: For a complete and up-to-date list of all deprecated sensors and their successors or alternatives, see Which sensors are deprecated and what are their successors or alternatives?\n\nThis article applies as of PRTG 16.x.23\n\nThe PRTG sensor cleanup\n\nYou know PRTG as a powerful yet easy-to-use network monitoring solution. When we implement new features, we always try to keep complexity as low as possible, so you can do what is important: monitor without configuration hassles. To keep PRTG usage simple for the future, we constantly analyze available features for their benefits and downsides.\n\nWe believe you prefer that we focus on features that the majority of PRTG customers use every day. Niche issues that only affect special use cases of PRTG distract this focus and spending our precious energy on such topics does not improve your overall user experience of PRTG. It is also ineffective when niche problems create substantial workload for both our technical support team and developers while other inquiries have to wait.\n\nTo be able to focus on important and popular topics, it is necessary that we reduce code complexity and currently available features like, for example, some sensor types. In this context, we recently evaluated the existing sensor types and discussed the following points for each one:\n\nIs it useful for many of our users or is the usage rate very low?\n\nIs it compatible with current systems or does it only support outdated target systems?\n\nIs it easy-to-use and do target systems work flawlessly with it, or does it create disproportional workload for you and our support team?\n\nIf a sensor type does not fulfill all of these requisites, then it is a potential candidate for removal from the software. Of course, whenever possible, we do not want to impair your monitoring experience, so we also considered options to provide alternatives for such sensor types.\n\nAs a result, starting with PRTG 16.x.23, we deprecated several sensor types (see below) and finally removed them in PRTG 16.x.25. Note that many of the sensors that we removed had already been deprecated in previous versions. However, some of them still existed (but you could not add new instances of them anymore).\n\nDeprecation and removal of sensors\n\nThe approach for sensors that are deprecated as of PRTG 16.x.23 is the following:\n\nDeprecated sensors will be marked as such in your PRTG installation.\n\nYou cannot add deprecated sensors to PRTG anymore, neither manually nor via Auto-Discovery.\n\nPRTG will additionally inform you about deprecated sensors with tickets.\n\nYou can still use deprecated sensors that you added in versions previous to PRTG 16.x.23.\n\nIn PRTG 16.x.25, the deprecated sensors were removed from PRTG:\n\nIf you still run deprecated sensors, these sensors will throw an error and show the Down status as of PRTG 16.x.25. They will not provide any monitoring data as of this version!\n\nYou will get a ticket that notifies you about these removed sensors.\n\nDelete these sensors to avoid “false” alarms in your installation or pause them to keep historic monitoring data.\n\nAdditionally, check if your maps, reports, and libraries include one of these sensor types. Manually delete them where necessary to avoid incorrect data.\n\nDeprecated sensor types and alternatives\n\nAfter analyzing the current sensor situation, we decided to remove the following sensor types from PRTG. If possible, we also provide an alternative so you can still monitor the desired data.\n\nThere are two categories of deprecated sensor types.\n\nThere are sensors that we deprecated with PRTG 16.x.23. These are sensors that you could add until this version and run until PRTG 16.x.25.\n\nThere are also older sensor types that were deprecated in previous versions (for example, in PRTG 12) and that you could not add anymore. These were removed from PRTG 16.x.25 as well.\n\nSensor types deprecated as of PRTG 16.x.23\n\nThe following sensor types are deprecated as of PRTG 16.x.23 and were removed with PRTG 16.x.25. See below for translations of deprecated sensor types into your PRTG language version.\n\nDeprecated SensorAlternative ADO SQLUse the ADO SQL v2 sensor instead.\n\nNote: If you have a great number of these sensors, consider the migration path for deprecated SQL sensors.

Windows Physical DiskUse the Windows Physical Disk I/O sensor instead. Windows RegistryUse a custom sensor as described in this article: How can I monitor the Windows registry with PRTG? Windows Scheduled TaskUse the custom ScheduledTask2XML sensor by PRTG Tools Family instead.\n\nNote: This sensor type requires Windows 7 or later or Windows Server 2008 or later on the target system. It does not support the outdated operating systems Windows Server 2003, Windows Vista, or Windows XP. WMI Logical DiskUse the WMI Logical Disk I/O sensor instead. WMI Volume FragmentationUse the custom VolumeFragXML sensor by PRTG Tools Family instead. WMI Windows VersionUse the custom WinOSVersion sensor by PRTG Tools Family instead.\n\nNote: We offer a migration path for the deprecated SQL sensors. If possible, they should be replaced with SQL v2 sensors nonetheless. The migration path is intended to give you more time to create corresponding SQL v2 sensors if you use a large number of deprecated SQL sensors. For more detailed information, see I use a large number of SQL sensors, can I continue using the deprecated SQL sensors somehow?\n\nSensor types deprecated before PRTG 16.x.23\n\nThe following sensor types were deprecated in PRTG versions before 16.x.23.\n\nDeprecated sensorDeprecated sinceAlternativeGerman designation Active Directory Replication Errors (original version)14.1.9Use the newer version of the Active Directory Replication Errors sensor as of PRTG 14.1.9.

versions - but don't you think it is way to complicated to add some MySQL-sensors now? I read about the security layer you want to put in there but I got about 60 MySQL-sensors to change to the new type of sensors now? I mean no one with the user permissions to edit sensors can edit them - that's enough security for some smaller instances like mine (about 200 sensors in total). I also can't damage anything on my database because the user for the monitoring doesn't have the permissions to update or create anything..\n\nSo I have to create a sql-file for every single sensor instead of just writing the statements directly in the sensor settings - much faster editing and creating.. I have to struggle with the credentials - if I got it correctly, I am only able to specify them for the whole device and not for the different sensors anymore (under the same device)? I can't see an option to specify the port on which the database is listening - especially not for different sensors under the same device?\n\nIf it is not really necessary to update and if the \"new\" sensors does not fully support anything I can do with the old ones, I think I won't update first...\n\nedit: Now I found out I have to specify the port in the same option as the credentials, for the whole device. Did you ever think about servers with more than one database-instances running? It doesn't have to be several mysql-server-instances but I am using proxies to seperate some layers of accessing the database(s) and so I have to specify different ports and credentials for different sensors for the same device. Will there be any reasonable solution for that? I don't want to add a device twice or more times.\n\nI hope you got my point - it is not very customer friendly to change that so hard.\n\nI have to put in a plug for the \"Last Windows Update\" sensor. I understand the replacement sensor is much more informational, but it's also really quite resource intensive as it's based on a powershell execution. Honestly, the detailed data reported by the newer Windows Update Status sensor is much more than we would ever need, and all of those metrics are available in the WSUS console anyway. The simplicity of a basic registry query showing the last windows update date is much more appropriate to a monitoring platform. I actually had gone to the trouble of removing all of the Windows Update Status sensors and replacing them with Last Windows Update because the powershell backed nature of the new sensor made returns inconsistent at best and led to delays on the whole probe server. I'd be curious to know if others had similar feelings and whether there was any chance of keeping the old sensor around, though I know that's not at all likely based on my post here. It's just very disheartening as the powershell probes are woefully inconsistent and reliable.\n\nFirst I want to state that understand the reason of the necessity to deprecate sensors. There is always a fight between amount of features and cost to support them all.\n\nTo deprecate a old one and create a new, is most of the time reasonable, but loosing statistics and baseline information, changing reports and maps is an unexpected nightmare.\n\nBut at the end, one reason I've decided to use and promote Passler for more than 5 years is the very large number of sensors and features Passler offered. The ratio of Cost and Feature was fantastic.\n\nProbably is reasonable to let all the deprecated sensors to function for longer period (even without support). But I also don't agree on short the time we have to migrate.\n\nThe way SQL V2 sensor is planned to use queries is a nightmare. What do we increase in security by adding the need to access the Sensor File System? With the profiles we have in the system is more that enough to protect the query. If you need to protect the query encrypt them (when stored).\n\nOne question: How do you know who is using a specific sensor or not do make a decision to deprecate him or not?\n\nTom, with the usage statistics on PRTG, we only remove sensors that already have a replacement, or have usage rates below 0.1% of all PRTG installations worldwide. We also know that removing some old sensor types puts some burden on our customers. We are sorry for that, but it is for a good cause: It allows us to remove very old, hard-to-maintain code and some outdated libraries/dlls from PRTG’s code base, which will result in less load on our developers for maintaining this old stuff. Less distraction by old stuff (which is only used by <0.1% of our customers) means that we can invest the freed-up-time on things that many more customers will profit from, including you.\n\nWe always try to look at this from a bird’s eye view and we try to balance between the needs of all customers and our team’s resources. This time we needed you and a few other customers to help the PRTG community in this process.\n\nHi,\n\nI am wondering why it was nessesary to deprecate the SQL-Sensors - they are not below the 0.1% for sure, and this is the reason they got replaced I guess. I'd really like to understand the reasons for getting a new created sensor. I see the benefits it brings, with better possibilities regarding data processing.\n\nWhat I do not understand is storing the query outside of the product. Using the file system for this is a bad decision in my eyes, as it makes working with the sensor more complicated. Here we have clearly seperate responsibilities for the servers hosting the software and maintaining the software itself - I guess this will be in most IT depts with more than a few people. Also it is much more complicate to change or even check a query of course, even when having access. It also results in problems when all persons resposible for SOME of the sql sensors have full access to the folder that contains ALL querys. What is your viewpoint doing this ?! What was wrong with the input box and saving it as a part of the configuration and let the permission model do its job?\n\nAnother thing that annoyes me: I am not able to change the used sql query file afterwards, and also not able to change sensor channels. What is the reason for that ?!? Why should I be forced to create a new sensor, resulting in lost of my historical data?\n\nSo you see, also from all the other posts: I guess you are working in another way with your product than some of your CUSTOMERS do, and I think you could get more satisfied customers when you (at least) let them UNDERSTAND your decision, and get a valuable dialogue on this topics.\n\nRegards Dominic\n\nDear Dominic\n\nThank you for your input. Even though we don't respond to any posting, we read every posting as we are happy that a user took the time to provide his perspective.\n\nThe SQL v2 could have been done differently, with a different set of advantages and disadvantages.\n\nThis is something we are aware of: Some users will not like the philosophy of our new sensors. However the new SQL v2 sensors follow our tried-and-true Exe/Script philosophy: Executing commands requires physical access to the according computers. This is an extra layer of security we deem more important than offering the convenience of the deprecated SQL sensors.\n\nWe are still listening to PRTG users and are working on SQL v2 improvements to make the sensor easier to use. We re-introduced the rowcount option in 16.2.24 and allow @-variables because of the feedback we got. However we no longer want to support sensors in which a PRTG user enters his custom query and possibly accesses data he is not supposed to see.\n\nWe consider the PRTG administrator, who also has physical access to the PRTG server, the right person to enter and review SQL statements. If you need to split the access rights to SQL file, please use remote probes. (The SQL v2 sensor only can use files present on the according probe.)\n\nChannel management poses some special issues for this sensor type.\n\nDeprecating the old SQL sensors is part of a greater good: We are getting rid of very old sensors which are hard to bugfix and hard to keep up-to-date. The new SQL v2 is much more robust and compatible.\n\nHi there,\n\nIn all honesty, i'm not sure i can agree with the argument that if a feature is little used, it should be removed from the supported list of monitored tools, since the main selling point of prtg is that it supports a wide range of sensors. This decision seems a bit absurd to me. You wouldn't burn the little read books in a library neither or demolish roads to villages where \"only a few people live\" ;-)\n\nWe rely on the mongodb and sql sensors for some critical services, and if they get removed we will simply be forced to look at alternate monitoring tools, implicitly raising the question whether we should stay with PRTG at all or not. Not to mention the risk of staying with PRTG: what if further crucial tools are deemed unpopular by a decision maker at paessler in the future? Should we invest in something that is volatile?\n\nPlease reconsider the retirement of the mongodb sensors (i see some folks already made noise about sql, just consider me a +1 there). Or at least, consider opensourcing the retirees in one way or another, so we can carry on maintaining them ourselves, somewhat reducing our risk.\n\ncheers, Laszlo\n\nDear Laszlo\n\nWith the right provider, MongoDB can be accessed via ADO and hence be used with the ADO SQL v2 Sensor.\n\nExplaining development decisions can be complicated as the full picture is quite large. Implementing / testing / documenting the MongoDB sensor was a bit of work, even though it shares a lot with our general SQL v2 sensor engine and existing general SQL v2 documentation. Still, it was not easy to decide to cut the sensor, as we put some effort in. We saw overall very little use of the dedicated MongoDB sensor. In a book library, you can just keep the existing books. In PRTG, every part of the software needs to be maintained and sometimes revised. The usage rate of this sensor did not justify that.\n\nThis was a learning process for us as well. We are now more careful when we introduce new sensors.\n\nIn case of MongoDB, there were outside effects as well: Beginning with version 3.2, MongoDB deprecates the HTTP interface. That is the interface which we used for the sensor."
