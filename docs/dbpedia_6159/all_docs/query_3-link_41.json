        "text": "Network and IT infrastructure monitoring continue to be crucial for enterprises. A business cannot afford to disregard the network's and IT resources' performance and security.\n\nNagios is still among the most widely used tools for IT infrastructure monitoring.\n\nBusinesses can immediately take control of and gain visibility into their IT infrastructure thanks to a full software stack.\n\nBusinesses may defend themselves from internal and external threats and prevent any potential downtimes by keeping an eye on network traffic, server uptime, performance, receiving system logs, etc.\n\nCompanies can alter how their networks function and what is tracked. To keep organizations safe, fortunately, the software offers both passive and active monitoring solutions.\n\nAlthough Nagios is a great solution, professionals wishing to explore more market possibilities can also take into account the following Nagios alternatives:\n\nPaessler PRTG\n\nSite24x7\n\nSolarWinds Network Performance Monitor\n\nZabbix\n\nIcinga\n\nPrometheus\n\nCheck_MK\n\nObservium\n\nLibreNMS\n\nOpenNMS\n\nCacti\n\nOP5 Monitor\n\nIn this article, we will discuss the following topics related to Nagios and its alternatives.\n\nWhat is the Nagios Network Monitoring Tool?\n\nHow Does Nagois Work?\n\nWhat are the Benefits of Nagios?\n\nWhy Consider Alternatives to Nagios?\n\nWhat factors should be considered when evaluating monitoring alternatives?\n\nWhat are some notable Open Source and Paid alternatives to Nagios?\n\nWhat steps are involved in migrating from Nagios to an alternative?\n\nNagios is an open-source tool created by Ethan Galstad for monitoring IT systems. Nagios can monitor devices using Linux, Windows, and Unix OSes and was created to run on the Linux operating system.\n\nThe Nagios software performs routine checks on important application, network, and server resource metrics. Nagios, for instance, tracks log files, memory usage, disk usage, and CPU load. It keeps track of how many processes are active at any given time. The Simple Mail Transfer Protocol (SMTP), Post Office Protocol 3, the Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP), and other widely used network protocols are among the services that Nagios can monitor. Active checks are started by Nagios, while passive checks come from connected external programs.\n\nEthan Galstad created Nagios, an open-source project that was first made available in 1999 under the name NetSaint. Many people later improved it. Using the Nagios Core technology as its foundation, Nagios Enterprises provides a variety of products, including Nagios XI, Log Server, Network Analyzer, and Fusion.\n\nNagios basically gathers your server's statistics (either using an agent like NRPE, check mk, or SNMP) and notifies you when one of the metrics rises above a certain threshold. Nagios executes a plugin that is installed on the remote client to verify the status of a remote service after every interval. In the description that follows, we'll go through a few of the monitoring methods Nagios employs:\n\nNagios Remote Plugin Executor (NRPE): This package is installed by Nagios on each remote computer that has to be watched, and it communicates using TCP port 5666. The necessary commands must be defined in a configuration file that is stored in the NRPE. As a result, whenever the NRPE daemon receives a query from the Nagios server, it searches the configuration file for the required command and executes it.\n\nMonitoring using SNMP: The key benefit of adopting SNMP is the vast range of devices that accept it, including routers, switches, and UPS units. By simply running an SNMP daemon on the remote host, you can use SNMP to monitor the network, OS, and hardware. This is possible because SNMP can retrieve values for many attributes from network devices and other SNMP-aware devices.\n\nNSCA - Nagios Service Check Acceptor: The client will periodically run a necessary plugin on his end and report the results to the Nagios server. Because the client executes plugins on a regular basis and reports its findings to NSCA on the Nagios server, this sort of monitoring is known as passive monitoring. The Nagios server is not in charge of initiating checks for this type of monitoring.\n\nThe primary advantages of Nagios are as follows:\n\nMonitor: DevOps can configure Nagios to monitor network protocols, system measurements, and IT infrastructure components.\n\nAlert: Whenever a crucial infrastructure component fails, Nagios will send out an alarm.\n\nResponse: DevOps responds by acknowledging alerts and implementing fixes.\n\nReport: Nagios can periodically publish and deliver reports on outages, events, SLAs, and other topics.\n\nMaintenance: We can turn off alerts during maintenance windows.\n\nPlanning: Nagios aids in infrastructure planning and upgrades by using historical data.\n\nWhen it was introduced in 1999 under the name NetSaint, Nagios was the first open-source utility to consolidate a large number of essential monitoring mechanisms for complex IT infrastructures. It relied on hosts and services, plug-ins for monitoring, and close collaboration with the open-source community. This approach set new standards at the time, but much has changed since then. It is becoming obvious that Nagios is no longer suitable for monitoring such advanced IT innovations.\n\nModern enterprise networks and systems are too complex for Nagios to monitor with an acceptable level of effort. Working with Nagios configuration files has always been cumbersome, but it is now too far from the norm. Other tools rely on automation and configuration concepts that can manage even a large number of hosts with relative ease. They also feature user-friendly graphical interfaces, whereas in the case of Nagios, operating on the Linux console is frequently required. The management of plug-ins and add-ons in Nagios is also not up to date: Nagios updates, documentation, and customization necessitate excessive manual fine-tuning.\n\nAs networks have grown larger and more complex, and as IT teams have been tasked with monitoring an increasing number of systems, the use of Nagios places monitoring administrators under extreme time constraints. This poses a threat to businesses and IT professionals. There is a risk that IT issues will be neglected, that there will be insufficient data on which to base decisions, and that costly human resources will be allocated.\n\nSome organizations anticipated that investing in commercial versions of Nagios would improve the performance of their IT teams and monitoring, but the drawbacks of the outmoded code base remain evident: The burden is relatively high, the graphical interface is obsolete, and the architecture heavily relies on active tests, limiting scalability. With Nagios, monitoring large environments with minimal effort is simply not feasible.\n\nPrior to the introduction of Nagios, it was typical for IT administrators to specialize in a small number of applications. However, over the past two decades, the complexity of IT in businesses has consistently increased, while staffing levels in IT departments have not kept pace. The requirements for IT professionals have increased. No longer is the time required to learn and operate Nagios available. Other tools respond more effectively to the requirements of their users, for instance, by being simpler to employ and relieving users through targeted automation.\n\nThe basic Nagios framework has a lot of limitations, some of which can be fixed by add-ons from third parties and some of which cannot. There is a poorly designed GUI, a dearth of database and performance records, difficulty with configuration, and a lack of automatic device discovery, among other issues of Nagios.\n\nWhile a third-party add-on may be able to resolve these problems in some circumstances, there are many advantages to a complete, unified monitoring solution that can give superior results without them. Keeping Nagios up to date and working in a dynamic environment can feel like a nightmare with all the Nagios plugins and add-ons available.\n\nHowever, some drawbacks, such as Nagios' inability to differentiate between different device types like servers, switches, and routers, cannot be fixed by add-ons. Some administrators and developers choose to use Windows Server over the Linux/Unix commands related to Nagios.\n\nNetwork administrators searching for an upgrade might wish to think about a Nagios replacement as software development progresses and solutions become easier to use.\n\nA thorough analysis of your network monitoring requirements is necessary before selecting the finest open-source network monitoring software for your company. You should take into account elements like security, community involvement, vendor support, and ease of use. Determining whether or not to purchase a premium product with extra services and support is another important decision.\n\nBe sure that the software complies with your company's specifications and can manage the volume, protocols, and unique requirements of your network. A thriving open-source community can offer helpful tools, plugins, and updates to keep the software up to date.\n\nWith capabilities like packet capture and analysis, network polling, data visualization, alarms, logging, and reporting of security events, the best network monitoring tools assist network administrators in managing their resources.\n\nTaking packets and studying data: In the absence of network data, network monitoring is not possible. While data analysis actually makes sense of the data, packet capture is the function that gathers data from various networking components. With the use of these technologies, IT specialists may examine data packets as they traverse a network, analyzing the information to look for potential problems. Users can diagnose problems, identify network congestion, and discover security concerns by examining packet data.\n\nCommunity polling: Consider network polling functions to be pulse checks. They frequently transmit polls, which may be signals or tests, to check the functionality of various networking devices. Network polling entails periodically asking network devices about their availability, performance, and status. Performance metrics and alarms are then generated using this data for network engineers and administrators.\n\nAlerting mechanism: One of the most important features of network monitoring software is real-time, automated warnings. Network administrators can be notified through alerts whenever a new issue, update, or other modification to the network has been found, either directly within the tool or through a third-party messaging service. Events like network outages, device malfunctions, or unusual traffic patterns may result in these notifications.\n\nVisualization of data and graphs: Not every network stakeholder is an expert in networking. All users can comprehend the most crucial networking metrics thanks to data visualization and graphs. It shows data in a simple and succinct manner, facilitating the identification of trends, patterns, and problems by network administrators and engineers. Heat maps, graphs, and charts can all be used in these visualizations.\n\nData archiving and event logging: Network monitoring frequently uses past data to enhance troubleshooting efforts in addition to current problems or changes. Because network teams must examine both past and present performance at once, event logging and data storage are crucial.\n\nReporting: Network administrators frequently have to communicate changes outside of the networking team after a problem or upgrade has been fixed on the network. The majority of network monitoring solutions allow you to share data from custom reports with other applications, and some products even include native reporting features. These reports can offer insightful information on network activities, including patterns of traffic, the functionality of devices, and security risks.\n\nAlthough Nagios is a great solution, professionals wishing to explore more market possibilities can take into account the following Nagios alternatives. Since many of the software options listed here are open-source and free Nagios alternatives, you'll also save money using them:\n\nPaessler PRTG\n\nSite24x7\n\nSolarWinds Network Performance Monitor\n\nZabbix\n\nIcinga\n\nPrometheus:\n\nCheck_MK\n\nObservium\n\nLibreNMS\n\nOpenNMS\n\nCacti\n\nOP5 Monitor\n\nPRTG Network Monitor is made to help companies succeed online. This monitoring program keeps track of all the data that is relevant to network performance overall.\n\nUptime, network consumption, information about specific machines, cloud computing services, database monitoring, network mapping, and many other metrics are now being monitored.\n\nPRTG monitors both specific machines and the entire network. This gives a precise view of network performance and quickly spots any possible problems.\n\nAnyone with an IT background will adore the product thanks to its user-friendly dashboard.\n\nFigure 1. PRTG Dasboard\n\nThe onboarding procedure will be very easy for businesses of all sizes to complete. Because of this, PRTG is still a great choice for the majority of organizations, regardless of sector.\n\nThis tool's straightforward licensing model and the fact that everything is included after you install the software are both features I find appealing.\n\nA free version with up to 100 sensors is available. If you download the 30-day free trial version with full functionality, it will revert to the free version when the trial has ended.\n\nPricing for larger networks ranges from $1600 (for 500 sensors) to thousands of dollars (for unrestricted sensors) (prices are for perpetual licenses)\n\nSite24x7, a monitoring tool located in the cloud, can keep an eye on infrastructure elements like servers, networks, containers, and virtualization platforms. Whether the server is hosted on-premises or in the cloud, an agent must be installed on it. Site 24x7 is able to gather all pertinent metrics from Linux and Windows servers and provide the data in a single console. This contains crucial Linux server performance indicators like load average and thread and handle count of processes, as well as CPU, memory, and disk utilization, services, and process health for Windows.\n\nFigure 2. Site24x7 Dasboard\n\nIn order to provide you with real-time insights on infrastructure health, the data gathered by the agent is shown in dashboards with views covering network information, application activity, and server metrics. Site24x7 can be used to keep tabs on the performance of Kubernetes clusters and Docker hosts. In addition to the tool's built-in monitoring features, you may create your own using Shell, PowerShell, Batch, VB, Python, and other programming languages.\n\nA free 30-day trial is available from Site 24/7. Prices for infrastructure monitoring start at $8 per month for up to 10 servers, with the opportunity to add on more monitoring.\n\nSolarwinds is a company that offers dozens of software programs for a variety of IT services, including monitoring. The functionalities that customers need today are included in the SolarWinds Network Performance Monitor (NPM) product. Clients that purchase this software bundle get comprehensive network troubleshooting tools as well as support for multi-vendor network monitoring.\n\nIn contrast to other tools, this one focuses more on monitoring network infrastructure (such as routers, switches, firewalls, load balancers, connection links, etc.) than entire networks and IT systems (like the previous vendors).\n\nA complete image of a specific network is provided via intelligent maps and comprehensive network insights. To prevent confusion, all of this information is presented in a clear and well-designed way.\n\nFigure 3. Solarwinds NPM Dasboard\n\nAdvanced alerts make an effort to only send out notifications when absolutely essential. Clients receive too many alerts from too many network performance monitors. In order to prevent this, SolarWinds developed a platform that, by default, only sends out vital alerts, greatly reducing the amount of noise.\n\nMore alerts are available for customers to activate and tailor to their needs. Nonetheless, the creators of this software strive to give users a seamless experience.\n\nThe term \"NetPath\" refers to one of this solution's outstanding characteristics. This function provides visual network path analysis (hop by hop), which is very helpful in locating issues, broken links, potential down servers, etc.\n\nThe NPM product currently has a starting price of $2,955, though you must contact Solarwinds for more information on pricing.\n\nZabbix has been in use for over two decades and has over 300,000 installations worldwide. Clients are given free access to Zabbix, an open-source project. Via Zabbix, network monitoring is advanced in a number of ways.\n\nThe program keeps track of everything, including virtual computers, databases, servers, and networks. Also included is complete cloud network monitoring, which is unusual for a free program.\n\nFigure 4. Zabbix Dasboard\n\nOnly Linux can run the program, and it also needs Apache, MySQL, and PHP. Several administrators found it to be relatively challenging to handle and configure, and it needed manual configuration to get up and running.\n\nBut, you can download an appliance that has already been set up and is ready to use (as a virtual machine to run on VMware, VirtualBox, etc.).\n\nFREE. Yep, this amazing remedy is totally free (open source).\n\nIcinga2 is yet another well-known free and open-source monitoring program. Icinga2 began as a Nagios clone and developed into a comprehensive network monitoring system, even for enterprise-level requirements. It needs customization and fine-tuning, like the majority of open-source programs, but it's incredibly adaptable and strong.\n\nBecause it is plugin-based, you may use pre-made plugins to monitor any host, program, or network device you can think of.\n\nYou can create your own monitoring script using a variety of languages, such as Python, PowerShell, VBS, etc. if a plugin is not yet available for a certain end-point.\n\nIt needs to be installed on a Linux operating system, and you must first install the core monitoring program before installing the web module, which provides GUI management of the utility. From that point on, there are numerous granularities available for achieving end-point monitoring.\n\nFor fine-grained network monitoring, the program can operate in a distributed environment that identifies masters, satellites, and agents. Because of this, IT specialists are able to easily recognize particular network components. With a thorough alert system in place, a complete ledger of analytics is offered.\n\nFigure 5. Icinga2\n\nIcinga2 is a fantastic software suite that provides control back to network managers.\n\nBased on Google's Borgmon, a time-series database and query tool that is still used internally by Google teams, Prometheus is an open-source network monitoring solution. For containerized networks that require more visibility throughout their infrastructure, Prometheus is the best open-source choice thanks to its time-series methodology and focus on a variety of data storage options.\n\nOn GitHub, Prometheus is accessible under the Apache 2 License. It is a suitable option for cloud or hybrid networking setups because it is a Cloud Native Computing Foundation graduating project.\n\nFeatures of Prometheus are as follows:\n\nFor queries that transform time-series data into different types of graphs, PromQL is available.\n\nData visualization using a console template language, an integrated expression browser, or Grafana.\n\nFederation and functional sharding for scaled storage requirements.\n\nFor notifications and silence, use an alert manager.\n\nClient libraries for service instrumentation\n\nFigure 6. Prometheus\n\nA different free and open-source program that also offers a business-oriented variant with more functionality and technical assistance is available. Checkmk provides both state-based and log-based monitoring. System administrators receive numerous levels of warnings from the monitoring software. About 1,700 intelligent plugins keep track of all activity on the network at any given time.\n\nCheckmk can currently monitor both software and hardware performance. Analytics for business intelligence give clients the metrics they want.\n\nCheckmk monitors a variety of devices, including servers, network devices, applications, etc., in contrast to Solarwinds NPM, which is solely focused on networking.\n\nIn order to detect faults and set off alarms, it gathers logs (using syslog, SNMP traps, etc.).\n\nPricing options of Checkmk are listed below:\n\nVersion Raw: Totally free\n\nEnterprise For up to 10 hosts, the free edition is free.\n\nEnterprise Basic Edition: Priced at Euro 600 and above\n\nManaged Services for Businesses: From Euro 1200\n\nObservium is another choice that provides both free and paid editions. Observium requires Apache and MySQL and runs on Linux.\n\nObservium is a fantastic substitute for Nagios. Although it supports auto-discovery using several techniques, including CDP, LLDP, and FDP, it mostly uses the SNMP protocol. Observium can handle any device that can send warnings and statistics via SNMP. Both network hardware and IT systems (servers, computers, etc.) are included in this.\n\nMoreover, agents that you install on the target system to relay data about resources, statistics, etc. can be used to perform some monitoring.\n\nThree editions of the software are currently offered to accommodate the demands of every user. Companies can satisfy their requirements for network monitoring with a low-maintenance solution.\n\nBecause most of Observium's capabilities are automated, many firms favor it. The software can be installed by users, and administrators have quick access to the environment.\n\nObservium Professional and Business cost Euro 230.00 or Euro 1,200.00 per year, respectively. Observium Community is free.\n\nUsing a variety of protocols, including CDP, FDP, LLDP, OSPF, BGP, SNMP, and ARP, LibreNMS automatically detects specific devices and end-points throughout the setup process. Users don't have to spend hours adding each device they want to monitor. Customized alerts make sure administrators are always aware of what is happening after that.\n\nInstalling the utility on Linux computers running Apache and PHP is free. An easy-to-use online interface is accessible to manage the solution, manually add new devices if desired, receive alarms, etc.\n\nLibreNMS offers a variety of approaches, including SNMP, syslog, using agents, etc., to monitor applications, network devices, IT systems, Linux machines, etc.\n\nThe real-time graphs of network bandwidth per port, up/down interface statistics, CPU use graphs, and many other things were very beneficial to a lot of people.\n\nFor network managers who are on the go, there are now iPhone and Android apps available.\n\nLibreNMS is Free.\n\nSince its inception in 2000, OpenNMS has been under development. One of the only complete open-source network monitoring suites on the market right now is OpenNMS.
