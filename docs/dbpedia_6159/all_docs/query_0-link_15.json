        "text": "I do use PRTG… but I use V5.0.1.301 enterprise licensed for up to 500 sensors…\n\nI haven’t upgraded for a couple of reasons - when I had a quick look at upgrading a while ago - you only seem to have a web application for it now, and I don’t like having web applications for things like this! I don’t really like web apps (except Spiceworks!).\n\nI have a whole bunch of custom graphs set up that show the 8 most important network traffic on our network, and then I have the monitor up on a wall so we can all see it and act upon any unusual spikes in the data. I can’t really do this with a web app as it tends to stop updating after a while - or the browser crashes after being open too long. I liked it being a stand alone program that had a web interface - but by the looks of things, I will have to get used to web apps sooner or later.\n\nAnother reason is… PRTG 5 works… and it does what we want - why would I upgrade to 8 while it’s still working fine on 5?\n\nAnd the final problem for me upgrading is quite simply - time! I don’t have time to test it - and 30 days isn’t enough for me to get it all installed and working so I can test it and work out if I want to keep it or look elsewhere for other software."
