        "text": "Hello,\n\nOK, so the method we use for this is a little unorthodox, but here is how we accomplish this.\n\nYou start by creating a Group, and naming it the name of your device. Then within that group, you create as many instances of your device as you want groups.\n\nExample:\n\nGroup -> Cisco Router\n\nDevice -> Interfaces\n\nDevice -> Netflow\n\nDevice -> System Health\n\nDevice -> SNMP Traps\n\nEach device in that example is the same device over and over. This is one of the nice features with PRTG in how you can have multiple instances of the same device. Then from each device, just hang the sensors that fit the \"group\".\n\nDoes this make sense to you?\n\nBenjamin Day\n\nPaessler Support\n\nWe are looking for the same feature. we have devices with more than 100 sensors and its, lets say, a mess.\n\nthe above example we were forced to when we started to use Cisco Nexus Systems with Fabric Extender. We have nexus with more than 1000 Ethernet Ports.\n\nits a huge overhead in implementing this in prtg and it is not possible to automate such stuff.\n\nSo I would also vote for a feature request"
