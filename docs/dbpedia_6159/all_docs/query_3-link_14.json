        "text": "Both PRTG and Checkmk are comprehensive network monitoring tools that let you keep an eye on your entire IT environment and make sure that your business operations run smoothly. Upon closer inspection, however, we did notice some differences between the two tools.\n\nIf you're looking for an alternative to Checkmk, then you should definitely check out PRTG Network Monitor. On this page, we’ll explain what makes PRTG stand out from Checkmk.\n\nPRTG Enterprise Monitor for large and distributed networks\n\nIf you’re looking for monitoring a large IT environment, then PRTG Enterprise Monitor might be the right choice for you. It is easy to upgrade and provides you with an overview of thousands of devices and systems in multiple locations.\n\nAnd thanks to its exclusive ITOps Board, you get a service-oriented view of your entire IT infrastructure and network in addition.\n\nTalk to an expert\n\nTried and tested tool developed by an experienced team\n\nPaessler has been making life easy for IT administrators for over 20 years. Today, more than 500,000 admins worldwide use PRTG. In our case studies, you'll find reports from companies from a wide range of industries that describe how they use PRTG and how the software helps them improve their business processes. PRTG also consistently ranks first in independent tests.\n\nOur dedicated team of developers work hard to ensure that each new version of PRTG is better than the last. In addition to making ongoing improvements to the software, the team develops new sensors to allow for the straightforward integration of devices and services.\n\nFlexible licensing model based on the number of sensors\n\nEvery PRTG license comes with the full range of features, which means you’ll never have to pay for plug-ins or add-ons. License prices are based on the number of required PRTG sensors. Each sensor covers several monitoring metrics, the so-called channels.\n\nWith Checkmk, prices are based on the number of services. A service can cover the same scope as a PRTG sensor, or it can be just a specific metric, which corresponds to the channel of a PRTG sensor. Even if pricing differs in terms of definition, the costs for PRTG and Checkmk are about the same.\n\nEasy & agentless setup, high customizability\n\nPRTG is set up in a few quick clicks. Its smart auto-discovery feature automatically adds relevant parts of your network to the monitoring environment. Of course, you can also configure PRTG in countless different ways to tailor the monitoring tool to your needs. With PRTG, you can even create your own custom sensors. What’s more: PRTG runs completely without the needs for agents.\n\nCheckmk also offers automatic network and service discovery as well as a large number of out-of-the-box integration plug-ins. While HTTP-, SNMP-, and API-based monitoring with Checkmk works without agents, all other monitoring requires the installation of a Checkmk agent on the monitored server or workstation.\n\nIntuitive and user-friendly\n\nMonitoring software only saves sysadmins time when it’s easy to use. PRTG is designed with an intuitive user interface that provides for excellent usability. With PRTG, sensors and measurement points can be added with just a few clicks. Easy-to-read visualizations of your network (for example, the Sunburst view) as well as customizable dashboards and network maps let you determine the status of your network at one quick glance.\n\nCheckmk also provides graphic maps and charts which are, however, relatively basic in look & feel. With Checkmk, it is not possible to create your own comprehensive and interactive network maps, as you can do with the PRTG map designer."
