        "text": "Trusted Every Day by 150.000 Admins Around the Globe\n\nMore than 150,000 administrators rely on PRTG Network Monitor every day to monitor their LANs, WANs, servers, websites, appliances, URLs, and more\n\nNetwork problems create business emergencies. When the network goes down, employees can't read emails. Customers can't purchase the product. Work stops. Network monitoring helps you keep your business healthy:\n\n• Avoid expensive outages\n\n• Address bottlenecks before they cause problems\n\n• Reduce costs by buying only the hardware you need\n\nStop wasting time putting out fires. Start building the future foundations of your business. You'll be less stressed and your colleagues will consider you a hero.\n\nBandwidth Monitoring: Find Out Who Is Using Your Network, For What\n\nPRTG Network Monitor runs on a Windows machine within your network, collecting various statistics from the machines, software, and devices which you designate. (It can also autodiscover them, helping you map out your network.) It also retains the data so you can see historical performance, helping you react to changes.\n\nPRTG comes with an easy-to-use web interface with point-and-click configuration. You can easily share data from it with non-technical colleagues and customers, including via live graphs and custom reports. This will let you plan for network expansion, see what applications are using most of your connection, and make sure that no one is hogging the entire network just to torrent videos.\n\nPRTG can collect data for almost anything of interest on your network. It supports multiple protocols for collecting this data:\n\n• SNMP and WMI\n\n• Packet Sniffing\n\n• NetFlow, jFlow, and sFlow\n\nSmartPhone applications for mobile network monitoring.\n\nOur apps make it possible to monitor your network while on the go. If you are using the PRTG network monitoring software from Paessler, all you need is an iPhone, iPad, iPod Touch, or an Android phone or tablet. With the according app you can check your network performance from anywhere.\n\nPerformance, Load, and Stress-Test for Web Servers\n\nBy simulating the HTTP requests generated by up to 10.000 simultaneous users, you can test your web server performance under normal and under excessive loads to ensure that critical information and services are available at speeds your end-users expect.\n\nThe Easy-to-use HTTP Load Generator for Windows\n\nThis software is quick to set up, it is easy to use and can create enormous loads for web servers."
