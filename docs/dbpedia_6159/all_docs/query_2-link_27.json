        "text": "We define one sensor as one aspect that you can monitor on a device. Such aspects can be, for example, a specific URL, the traffic of a network connection, a port of a switch, or the CPU load of a device. Usually, you need about 5 to 10 sensors per device to fully cover its monitoring.\n\nEach PRTG sensor has individual channels that show the measured or calculated data. The SNMP Traffic sensor, for example, has channels for ingoing traffic, outgoing traffic, and total traffic.\n\nPRTG comes with more than 250 preconfigured sensors. For more information, see our List of Available Sensor Types.\n\nYes, it does. You can create high-level or in-depth reports on demand or automatically via schedules on a daily, weekly, monthly, or annual basis. PRTG comes with several preconfigured report templates that you can choose from, or you create highly customized reports to include only the elements you need for your specific requirements.\n\nWhat’s more: you can export reports to your system in XML or CSV format, generate PDFs, or show them directly in you web browser in HTML format.\n\nYes, it does. PRTG comes with preconfigured warning and error thresholds that trigger an alarm if there is an issue in your network and that you can customize according to your needs. You can also define granular alerting rules by setting notification triggers that specify when exactly PRTG should send an alert to which person or team.\n\nThere are several notification methods and channels that you can choose from. These include notifications via email, SMS, Microsoft Teams or Slack messages, Syslog or SNMP trap messages, push notifications to our PRTG apps for iOS or Android, and more.\n\nYes, it does. With the access rights management in PRTG, you can define which user in which user group can access which objects in your PRTG installation.\n\nYou can create a nearly unlimited number of users, which you can organize in a nearly unlimited number of user groups. There are read-only users, read/write users, and administrators, as well as user groups with no access, read, write, or full access.\n\nEach user group can have separate access rights for each monitoring object, as well as for libraries, maps, and reports. These settings are automatically inherited according to the object hierarchy so that it is not necessary to edit the access rights of every sensor individually.\n\nYes, it does. With PRTG, you can get graphical real-time overviews of your IT infrastructure with live status information. You can view your entire monitoring setup in the form of a device tree, in a so-called sunburst view, or in a tile view.\n\nOr you use our built-in drag-and-drop map editor to create your own network topology maps or custom dashboards to visualize your monitoring the way you need it. PRTG offers more than 300 widgets to do so – from traffic charts to device and status icons to custom images.\n\nYes, you can. A PRTG cluster consists of two or more PRTG servers that work together to form a high-availability monitoring system. Next to a master node, you can configure up to 4 failover nodes, where each node is a full PRTG installation that can do all monitoring and alerting on its own. For more information, see the PRTG Manual: Failover Cluster.\n\nPRTG offers a single failover cluster (one master node and one failover node) with all licenses, including the Freeware Edition. If you need more failover nodes, additional PRTG licenses are required.\n\nOur Paessler Knowledge Base contains questions and answers about monitoring with PRTG as well as best practices.\n\nOur PRTG Sensor Hub offers native PRTG sensors, scripts from Paessler or PRTG users, and device and notification templates. This site also needs your participation – sensors or templates are created from your experience!\n\nYou can also join our reddit community or follow us on LinkedIn to interact with us directly.\n\nPRTG comes with an easy-to-use installation wizard with which you can install the entire software including database and web server in less than 10 minutes. After installation, the automatic network discovery immediately starts scanning your network to set up the first devices and suitable sensors for you. Our Smart Setup assistant then leads you through the initial setup steps to help you get started with your monitoring.\n\nMonitoring data usually consists of very small amounts of data that are collected at regular intervals. Our tests have shown that a classical database is not that well-suited for an efficient storage of this type of data. This is the reason why we developed our own database, which stores data in a flat file format and is optimized for monitoring data.\n\nThe integrated database of PRTG has several benefits:\n\nPerformance: Our database is much faster than other databases. This way, we can analyze and show historic data in near real time.\n\nNetwork load: As the database is integrated into the main server installation of PRTG, additional data transfer through your network is not necessary.\n\nConfiguration and maintenance: Our integrated database does not need any extra configuration or maintenance. Updates are deployed automatically with the usual PRTG updates.\n\nEasy backup: You can simply back up the database by copying the data files.\n\nLicensing: The database is included in all PRTG licenses. No other database license is required.\n\nData export: In case you need your data for other applications or statistics, you can export monitoring data from PRTG at any time via the integrated API.\n\nThe auto-update in PRTG is available for users of the Freeware and Trial Editions of PRTG, as well as for customers who own an active PRTG Network Monitor subscription. Every PRTG installation regularly connects to our servers to check if a new version of PRTG is available. If there is, PRTG automatically downloads the new version and notifies the administrator who can then install it with just a few clicks.\n\nThe process for building new, major versions of software applications requires specification, building, testing, and deploying (or rollout). We at Paessler decided that instead of having a massive release once a year with 500 new features, which also takes a year to build and test, we release new versions of our software in shorter cycles. This means that we aim for a continuous rollout of a new PRTG version every two months.\n\nAll license sizes are available as subscriptions. They differ by the number of sensors that you can add to your monitoring setup:\n\n** For very large environments, please also refer to our sizing recommendations. If you have more than 1,000 devices, check out Paessler PRTG Enterprise Monitor.\n\nFor the 30-day Trial Edition, the number of sensors and devices is not restricted. The Freeware Edition includes up to 100 sensors for about 10 devices.\n\nNo, it is not possible to combine different PRTG Network Monitor licenses on one server, for example, buying a license for 500 sensors and a license for 1,000 sensors does not mean that you can use 1,500 sensors in one installation. PRTG only accepts one license key per server. If you need more sensors, you can upgrade to a larger license any time.\n\nIf you have a large environment, you have several options, depending on your individual needs and requirements. With our PRTG Network Monitor licenses for large infrastructures, you can set up 5,000 sensors to monitor about 500 devices, or 10,000 sensors to monitor about 1,000 devices.\n\nIf you want to monitor more than 1,000 devices, we recommend that you check out Paessler PRTG Enterprise Monitor, our monitoring solution for very large environments.\n\nYes, there is. We offer a risk free, 30-day money-back guarantee for new subscriptions. This means that if you are not satisfied with our software, please contact us within 30 days of your purchase und we will refund your order in full. Please note that your license will be deactivated after cancellation."
