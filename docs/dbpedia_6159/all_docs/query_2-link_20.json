They want to see how the network is performing day to day, when high times are, are we getting the speeds we pay for, and down times.\n\nI am trying to come up with ways of getting a general/ball park set of tests to get that information. One of the challenges I am facing is we use WAN SD optimization so if I use the same files to test with I will get skewed results because it is being cached on both endpoints. Here is what I have drawn up so far:\n\nInternet Speed:\n\nThe easiest way is to pick a handful of PC’s and go to speedtest.net each day and run the tests at the same time and record in a spreadsheet. This is super time consuming. Not to mention if I am out sick or if a machine down there will be missing data.\n\nLAN Speed:\n\nI am thinking of running a iPERF test on the same handful of machines getting results from that an entering into spreadsheet. Again same downsides.\n\nIs anyone aware of better, hopefully more automated, way of accomplishing this?\n\nAlso let me know if I did a horrible job of explaining this.\n\nTake another look at PRTG , because we can monitor WAN and LAN speeds, including file download time. Start with SNMP traffic sensors on all ports that you care about (both WAN and LAN ports), which will give you graphs of your traffic on those ports. So you can see what your baseline usage and peaks are.\n\nThen, to test file download speed there are two choices – both are described in this article: Measure download speed | Paessler Knowledge Base\n\nEssentially, you can either:\n\nuse a script sensor to run speedtest on a regular schedule (eg every 10 minutes) and monitor/graph the results. The script to do this is available at the link above; or\n\nuse an HTTP Advanced sensor to download a file from a web server and monitor/graph the download time. Since you can also download from internal web servers doing this, you can measure LAN-only download speeds with this method.\n\nIf you’d like to give PRTG a try, we offer two versions:\n\nAn on-premises version , with a free 30-day trial with unlimited sensors, and a free forever version with 100 sensors; or\n\nA hosted/cloud version , with a free 10-day trial with 500 sensors\n\nIf you have any questions, please just let me know!\n\n@Paessler_AG"
