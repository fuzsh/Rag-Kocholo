This acquisition isn't just about expanding our portfolio; it's about reshaping the way IT departments interact with their infrastructures. ?? We will take a look at the massive ROI benefit that Qbilon brings, but first, let's look at what they do, and why they caught our eye.\n\nIs it worth the RISC-V?\n\nMore and more companies are captivated by the RISC-V revolution (Reduced Instruction Set Computer - Version Five, say ?risc-five?). With a golden future on the horizon, RISC-V is poised to reshape the computing landscape. Tech giants like Google are recognizing its potential, going so far as starting to make RISC-V a ?tier-1 platform? in Android. The open-source nature of RISC-V invites collaboration and empowers developers to shape the future of computing. But what exactly is RISC-V, and what advantages does it hold in comparison to ARM and x86? In this article, we will embark on an enlightening journey to unravel the mysteries of RISC-V and delve into its extraordinary advantages.\n\nUnderstanding MQTT architecture: a deep dive\n\nMonitoring industrial information networks is essential to ensure performance, reduce unplanned downtime, and optimize energy use in daily production. An important aspect of monitoring these networks is understanding the protocols in use, the most common of which are HTTP, OPC UA, and MQTT, among others. For this article, we will focus specifically on monitoring MQTT, which has become more common in Operational Technology networks with the rise of the IIoT (Industrial Internet of Things).\n\nPRTG and Esendex: getting the message across\n\nEven the best managed, designed, and equipped network in the world will still occasionally go wrong (yes, we?re looking at you, DNS). Let?s face it, that?s why most of us sysadmins have a job: ?cos stuff breaks.
