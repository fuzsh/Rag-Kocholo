        "text": "System Center Operations Manager (SCOM) is part of the Microsoft System Center product family. Based on the installation of agents, it manages and monitors the health and performance of computer systems, services, devices, and applications. Management Packs that you must buy additionally expand the monitoring offering, which is more specialized in Microsoft applications.\n\nPaessler PRTG Network Monitor is an agentless, vendor-independent, and easy-to-use all-in-one monitoring tool that provides you with a comprehensive feature set. Learn why PRTG is much more than just an alternative to SCOM.\n\nQuick and easy installation and setup\n\nWith PRTG, your monitoring is ready to go in only a few minutes. Just follow the few steps in the installation wizard and PRTG, including the easy-to-use web interface, is installed on your system. The auto-discovery functionality scans your network directly for available devices and automatically creates matching measuring points – so-called sensors. You can then easily add more devices and sensors or customize them according to your needs.\n\nThe installation and setup of SCOM, on the other hand, is extremely complex. SCOM not only requires access to a Microsoft SQL server for various SQL databases. Several servers for different tasks must also be installed and set up for SCOM to go live. Those who want to use the web console must also install it separately.\n\nIn the time it takes you to install and configure SCOM, you can already keep an eye on your monitoring with PRTG – just sit back and relax.\n\nAgentless monitoring of your entire IT infrastructure with PRTG\n\nPRTG is agentless and monitors servers, routers, switches, virtual machines, services, and much more, regardless of vendor or provider. Devices are integrated in the blink of an eye via the respective protocol used.\n\nPRTG supports not only common protocols such as SNMP, flow, WMI, HTTP, or SSH, to name just a few, but also the industrial protocols Redfish, MQTT, Modbus, or the connection via OPC UA. Over 250 preconfigured sensors that PRTG offers out of the box help you set up the best and most comprehensive monitoring for your IT environment.\n\nIn contrast, SCOM is agent based and specializes in monitoring Microsoft-based applications. SCOM offers only limited monitoring functionality in addition. The monitoring scope can be extended by buying additional Management Packs, which are offered natively for some products or which some vendors offer themselves.\n\nCost-effective all-in-one monitoring tool\n\nTransparent licensing and pricing – that's what PRTG stands for. Whether you choose an on-premises installation of PRTG Network Monitor or an instance of PRTG Hosted Monitor that Paessler hosts for you: a PRTG license includes all monitoring features. The purchase of expensive physical servers is also kept within reasonable limits. For example, you only need one server for an installation of PRTG Network Monitor, and none at all for PRTG Hosted Monitor, as everything happens in the cloud.\n\nEven if you already own SCOM as part of the Microsoft System Center suite, costs can quickly accumulate as soon as you want to expand your monitoring. In addition to the acquisition costs for several servers, the Management Packs for various products and vendors are usually also provided only for a fee.\n\nWith PRTG, adhering to your budget is no problem. You decide what's right for you: For PRTG Network Monitor, there are annual subscriptions from 500 up to 10,000 sensors. With PRTG Hosted Monitor, you can choose from flexible monthly, annual, and multi-year subscription plans for more scalability. PRTG Enterprise Monitor offers annual subscription licenses for an unlimited number of servers, based on the number of sensors in use.\n\nUser-friendly user interfaces\n\nIT infrastructures and networks are usually complex enough as it is. All the better if you have an appealing and easy-to-use monitoring tool like PRTG, with which you get a comprehensive overview of your network.\n\nAnd this is not all – no matter what usability you prefer, there is something for everyone. For example, in addition to the PRTG web interface, PRTG also offers a desktop app as well as PRTG apps for iOS and Android for your monitoring on the go."
