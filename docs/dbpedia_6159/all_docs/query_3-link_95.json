        "text": "NetFlow monitoring: 4 reasons why you should consider PRTG\n\nNetFlow monitoring lets you analyze your network traffic and get a picture of network traffic flow. This can help you understand which process, user, or application might cause speed problems or network outages.\n\nWith our PRTG NetFlow analyzer, you get a holistic view of your network, keep an eye on your network traffic and what your bandwidth is being used for.\n\nNetFlow is a protocol for collecting, aggregating and recording traffic flow data in a network. NetFlow data provide a more granular view of how bandwidth and network traffic are being used than other monitoring solutions, such as SNMP. NetFlow was developed by Cisco and is embedded in Cisco’s IOS software on the company’s routers and switches and has been supported on almost all Cisco devices since the 11.1 train of Cisco IOS Software.\n\nRead more\n\nAnalyze your network traffic\n\nOur NetFlow monitoring tool PRTG lets you analyze and monitor your bandwidth and determine, for example, the amount of traffic caused by IP addresses , protocols, or programs. To carry out such an analysis, configure your routers in a way that flow packets are sent to a PRTG server or a computer that has a PRTG remote probe installed.\n\nBenefit from high efficiency & scalability\n\nNetFlow puts only little strain on your CPU and is especially adapted for networks with heavy data traffic. With its flexible licensing model, PRTG is easy to adapt to changing network demands.\n\nAutomatic, customizable alerts included\n\nPRTG automatically alerts you by SMS, email, push notification, or many other customizable notification methods when threshold values are exceeded. Notifications sent by PRTG reach you wherever you are – even while on the go.\n\nVisualize data on easy-to-read dashboards\n\nPRTG displays your network traffic data on highly customizable, easy-to-read dashboards and maps . As a cross-manufacturer monitoring software, PRTG eliminates the need to juggle a number of different software solutions – just combine your NetFlow monitoring with data from all other devices in your IT infrastructure and visualize them the way you need.\n\nUse our built-in PRTG sensors for NetFlow monitoring that come with every PRTG license out of the box. Each sensor lets you break down traffic into the top talkers, top connections, and top protocols in your network to find out which device is using up your bandwidth.\n\nNetFlow v5 sensors\n\nNetFlow v5 is in widespread use. With PRTG, you get a preconfigured NetFlow v5 sensor as well as a NetFlow v5 (Custom) sensor for devices that have NetFlow v5 enabled.\n\nNetFlow v9 sensors\n\nNetFlow v9 is an advanced form of the NetFlow technology. PRTG provides you with the preconfigured NetFlow v9 sensor and NetFlow v9 (Custom) sensor for devices that have NetFlow v9 enabled.\n\nIPFIX sensors\n\nInternet Protocol Flow Information Export (IPFIX) is an advanced form of Cisco's NetFlow technology. PRTG offers two preconfigured sensors: The IPFIX sensor and the IPFIX (Custom) sensor.\n\nWith PRTG, you can easily detect, for example, if your switches are not equipped to handle the quantity of data that passes them – before they become completely overloaded.\n\nWhat’s more: should these switches actually overload during a backup , for example, PRTG helps you to quickly find the root cause of the issue.\n\nVirtual NetFlow monitoring with PRTG\n\nSet up NetFlow in the VMware vCenter and configure it in such a way that these flows are sent to PRTG, where a corresponding flow sensor monitors and displays the data. As long as the correct NetFlow version is used, it will make no difference to PRTG where the flows come from.\n\nMany tools can collect and analyze flow data. When choosing a tool, you should consider your needs, and the extent to which you would like to analyze your data. It might also make sense to use several different tools concurrently. We have found, for example, that many administrators use Wireshark in addition to PRTG. Thanks to its flow monitoring, PRTG can give you an overall picture while allowing you to rule out possible causes of network problems. Wireshark, on the other hand, offers a detailed look at individual data packets.\n\nUsing a single tool like PRTG for NetFlow data collection and analysis can be more efficient and cost-effective than using two separate tools. A single tool usually provides a unified interface for both tasks, making it easier to navigate and use.\n\nAdditionally, having one tool for both tasks can reduce the complexity and maintenance required for the system, as there is only one set of software to update and troubleshoot.\n\nFurthermore, using only one tool can ensure consistency in data collection and analysis, reducing the risk of errors or discrepancies between the two separate tools.\n\nPRTG is a NetFlow collector and analyzer that runs on Windows. As our focus has always been on Windows systems, we have acquired quite a bit of expertise in the area of NetFlow monitoring with Windows. It also uses technologies that enable you to monitor non-Windows operating systems.\n\nMany administrators wonder if there is an effective, free NetFlow analysis tool on the market, or if they should consider using a professional one. PRTG comes with 100 free sensors for life. And if you decide to expand your monitoring in the future, you can purchase a professional license at any time."
