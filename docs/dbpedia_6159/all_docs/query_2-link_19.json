        "text": "Paessler PRTG Network Monitor Integration\n\nGet unrivaled insights into your technology assets’ status, health, and performance.\n\nAsset visibility is a big problem for many IT teams. Not having an accurate inventory of tech assets is inefficient, costly, and a potential security risk, and for all but the smallest networks, an inventory spreadsheet won’t cut it.\n\nYou can’t manage what you don’t know you have\n\nIn many organizations, the IT Department is responsible for keeping the infrastructure running efficiently and for the procurement, maintenance, and, ultimately, disposal of the physical hardware and software assets the company relies upon. This obligation carries financial, compliance, and security implications.\n\nCollate asset intelligence with Lansweeper\n\nIT teams face many challenges, such as increasing complexity, continual change, and budgetary demands. Keeping accurate track of their technology assets can help alleviate some of these pressures. Lansweeper provides a powerful, easy-to-use asset intelligence platform that tracks the lifecycle of assets from procurement and (re)allocation to disposal. It automatically collects information using standard protocols or by an easily deployed, optional agent. It can be deployed on-premise with multiple sites aggregated into a single, centralized, cloud-based instance.\n\nTrack asset health with PRTG\n\nPaessler’s award-winning PRTG family of products collects, analyzes and reports on the health and performance of any networked device.
