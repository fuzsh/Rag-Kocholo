I am curious to know if you have had any experience with them and what was the good and bad ?\n\nI have used PRTG for 3 years and it is a good product for my environment. We use many of the out of the box sensors (Windows, SNMP for network, VM’s) and also write custom scripts (powershell, batch, etc) to monitor some of our MySQL and Java systems. I think it is fairly priced and easy to manage. Upgrading is painless including remote probe updates.\n\nI’ve used it for probably about 8yrs.\n\nCurrently monitor approx 2100 sensors. It’s constantly being improved and updated.\n\nI recommend it to others quite often.\n\nThere is a learning curve as far as what all you can do with it because there is a lot of capability there. However simple monitoring is very quick and easy to set up.\n\nThe remote probes are great if you have multiple locations you need to monitor back at a central site.\n\nWe use it, and it’s great to have. Definitely a bit of a learning curve involved. I like the smartphone/tablet apps. The widgets in Android could use some polishing, like the alarms list (it doesn’t seem to want to update unless I kill the widget and re-add it). Otherwise, I’m constantly watching my PRTG widgets for alerts and warnings.\n\n@Paessler_AG\n\nSounds like it is a good product, wanted to make sure all the bells and whistles were not glazing my eyes over for the future of the product.\n\nthanks for all the input, nobody has bashed it as of yet\n\nI’ve had it in Production for about a year and a half now and I love it. Super easy to install and configure, fairly good tech support, and the pricing structure is simple and straight-forward. It’s made my job much easier, and being able to react to downtime or present a years’ worth of historical data on a server makes me look like a superhero.\n\nI currently monitor about 30 servers and other devices, and roughly 350 sensors in total. It’s been great."
