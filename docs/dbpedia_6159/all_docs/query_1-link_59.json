The issue I’m trying to isolate is at one of our remote sites, where all of a sudden users are getting dropped from the network. However by the time we are notified and look at the network all is back to normal. Can someone recommend a good free solution to maybe give some insight on what is going on?\n\nYou could try PRTG . It monitors bandwidth, availability, etc and will detect when the connection has dropped. It will then send you an alert by email, SMS, push notification, etc when it detects that something is wrong, so you can look at the problem immediately, before it resolves itself. If you install a \" remote probe \" at the remote site, you can also monitor QoS parameters like jitter and delay between your central location and the remote location.\n\nWe offer a free 30-day trial with an unlimited number of sensors, and after the 30 days it automatically reverts to our free 100-sensor version with full functionality, including the remote probes.\n\nIf you’d like to get an idea of how PRTG looks and works before you install it, we have some introductory videos available.\n\n@Paessler_AG\n\nJust have a little hint for you here: if you don’t want to set up a probe on AWS yourself, check out PRTG’s \" Cloud HTTP Sensor \" and/or the \" Cloud Ping Sensor \". These two sensors will ping or HTTP(S) to the DNS name or IP address you specify from 5 different locations around the world.\n\nBasically, we’ve already set up the AWS probe for you – you just need to use it.\n\nThis function is free and is included in every PRTG license, even the freeware version.\n\n@Paessler_AG"
