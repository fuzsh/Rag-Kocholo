It is based on the concept of sensors, with over 200 different predefined sensors for applications and hardware-specific ones for switches, routers, and servers.\n\nA concerned reader pointed to a thread on the PRTG subreddit, which in turn pointed at a note on the website of German IT outfit MEKO-S GmbH , a service provider that resells Paessler. The Mekos post states that Paessler has now effectively switched users of PRTG to subscription-based licensing. As of July 1, it is no longer possible to extend the maintenance of a current license, as many users did every year, according to the IT firm’s website.\n\nMekos says in its post that a license for PRTG XL1 (unlimited) previously cost €3,900 ($4,185) for a maintenance extension for one year, will now reportedly cost €8,800 ($9,443). It also claims that a license for PRTG 5000 (for large environments), which it claims was previously priced at €2,900 ($3,112) for a maintenance extension, will now cost €6,500 ($6,975). We asked Paessler for comment on its historical and new pricing."
