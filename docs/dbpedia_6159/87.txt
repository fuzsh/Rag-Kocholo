Paessler PRTG Monitoring Limitations

When evaluating PRTG, you should be aware of the following limitations, reported by users on the G2 platform.

Alarm Management Complexity

Managing alarms in PRTG can become complex due to the volume and variety of alerts generated across the IT infrastructure. As networks expand and diversify, system administrators may face challenges in prioritizing and responding to alarms. They need to fine-tune alert thresholds and filter out false positives to minimize unnecessary notifications.

Cost

The cost of PRTG is influenced by the scale of deployment and the monitoring needs of an organization. PRTG offers a free version with limited sensors for small networks, but larger deployments can be expensive, with associated software licensing and maintenance costs.

Customization Requirements

Customizing PRTG to fit specific monitoring needs requires understanding both the IT infrastructure and the tool’s capabilities. Users may need to invest time in setting up custom sensors, maps, and reports that align with their operational objectives, which can require significant time and effort.
