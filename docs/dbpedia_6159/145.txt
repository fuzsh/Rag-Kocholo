Paessler PRTG Network Monitor and Paessler PRTG Hosted Monitor offer almost the same extensive monitoring feature set, custom real-time alerting and notifications, customizable reports, historical data analysis, and much more.

However, our two monitoring products differ in the way theyâ€™re implemented, as well as in licensing. While PRTG Network Monitor requires an on-premises installation on dedicated servers in your network, PRTG Hosted Monitor is hosted by Paessler in the cloud using AWS.

Moreover, while PRTG Network Monitor offers annual subscriptions from 500 up to 10,000 sensors, for PRTG Hosted Monitor you can choose from flexible monthly, annual, and multi-year subscription plans for more scalability.
