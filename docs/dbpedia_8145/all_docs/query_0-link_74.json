        "text": "Mishti, or Bangladeshi sweets, play a significant role in Bangladeshi culture, whether on festivals, special occasions, or a regular day.\n\nCrafted from ingredients like milk, sugar, and flour, these confections are more than just desserts; they capture the essence of Bangladeshi life. These sweet treats prove the nation's rich culinary heritage, adding a sweet touch to every moment they grace.\n\nDifferent regions of Bangladesh offer different types of sweets. Dhaka has Chomchom, Rosogolla, Rajshahi has Pithas, Doi, Khulna has Shor Bhaja, and Barisal has Labanga Latika. These are just a few of the regions; this article focuses on the unique sweet of Netrakona: Balish Mishti.\n\nThe artisan of Balish Mishti is Goyanath Ghosh of Netrakona. A hundred years ago, he made sweets shaped like pillows as a hobby. Later, he established his sweet shop, Goyanath Mishtanno Bhandar, on Barhatta Road.\n\nBalish Mishti is commonly shaped like lap pillows. Because of their incomparable taste, the reputation of Balish sweets spread far and wide within a short time. Along with this, Goyanath Ghosh, the original maker of this sweet, also became widely known. So, his name was also associated with his sweets after some time. The popular name of Balish sweet became Goyanath's Balish.\n\nBefore moving to India in 1969, Goyanath Ghosh taught other artisans how to make Balish Mishti. Since then, pillow sweets have been made in every sweet shop in Netrakona. Specially Khan Sweets, Matrichaya, Srikrishna Sweets, Durga Cabin, Mukti Sweets, Mishtighar, Madhuban, Gyanada Sweets, and Uttara Sweets shops regularly make pillow sweets.\n\nBalish sweets from these shops are now supplied to elite sweet shops in different districts of the country, including the capital, Dhaka. However, traditional pillow sweets are sold as pieces. It comes in three common sizes, and their prices are 25 taka, 50 taka, and 100 taka.\n\nHowever, if one orders, he can buy a pillow sweet for Tk 200 or Tk 500. It is better to say that most people cannot eat such a big pillow.\n\nBalish Mishti is made with chana, sugar, and flour. First, a dough is made by mixing a little flour with milk curd. Pillows of different sizes are made of that dough.\n\nIt is then fried in hot sugar syrup. After cooling, it is immersed in sugar syrup for a long time. At the time of sale, the pillow is coated with condensed milk or Malai. Also, the artisans maintain some secrecy about the process of making Balish Mishti for commercial reasons.\n\nWhen there is any event in Netrakona, the name of Balish Mishti comes first. Especially if it's a birthday or a wedding, there is no other alternative than it. Gaye Holud events in Netrakona have high demands for such sweets. Many take these sweets with them when visiting their relatives.\n\nNetrakona is rich in natural resources like china clay, fisheries from Haors, and their natural beauty. If anyone travels there, Balish Mishti must be on his checklist."
