You have every right to leave and create a safer and a happy space for yourself\"\n\n___________________________________________\n\nAt The Maheshwari's\n\nAfter giving Mishti the injection Abir stayed there in Mishti's room till the morning. Kuhu and Kunal also stayed there with him in Mishti's room. They all had a sleepless night. Abir was sitting beside Mishti by holding her hands. He looked restless through all the time.\n\nAbir was looking at her constantly. Mishti looked so innocent while sleeping with her eyes closed. She looked more pretty when she talked less. He smiled unknowingly. Kunal rested himself on the couch in the room and Kuhu also. Kuhu rested her head on Kunal's shoulder and interlocked her hand with his. They were hell tired. Kuhu and Kunal fell alseep but Abir remained awake.\n\nIn the morning, when Badi ma opened her eyes in the morning she started looking for Mishti. But Abir very strictly asked Bade papa to not let Badi ma to utter a single word as she had stitches there in her throat. Bade papa assured Badi ma that he would bring Mishti to her and Badi ma calmed herself down.\n\nBade papa was shouting by Mishti's name but there was no reply. He was shouting continuously by her name. Hearing Bade papa's loud voice Abir woke up. He also fell asleep because of tiredness. When Abir woke up and looked at Mishti, she was still sleeping. Abir imagined himself pecking her forehead.\n\nAbir immediately jerked of his mind and he was in hell of a shock. His eyes went big. He shooked his head in a negative way. But then Abir felt that he might have imagined this because of feeling guilty and the care towards her. Abir tried to ignore the feelings but that thing was eating up his mind. His thought diverted away because of Bade papa's loud voice. He was still shouting by her name.\n\nAbir slowly and very carefully got up from the bed. He didn't notice that he was still holding Mishti's hand. He patted his head with his other hand. He gently let go of her hand and then went to Kunal and started to shook him. Kunal slowly opened his eyes. He saw his brother was looking very tired. He quickly got up and also woke up Kuhu. Meanwhile, Bade papa came to Mishti's room. He couldn't understand anything. Mishti was lying on the bed. She had some bandage on her hand. Her room was looking like a hospital cabin. He panicked."
