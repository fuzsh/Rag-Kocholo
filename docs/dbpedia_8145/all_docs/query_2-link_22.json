        "text": "\"Yeah, I remember.\"\n\nRaj, gazing out the window, turned his head slightly to his left where Adair stood. He couldn't see the changing expressions on Adair's face. \"You remember you saved a girl when she was about to jump from the bridge?\" Raj continued, his eyes still fixed outside. Adair's face remained unreadable, but his attention was unwavering.\n\n\"She was Mishti. She never saw your face, but someone told her that she was saved by one of the Patel brothers. She asked me, and I lied. I told her I was the one who saved her, but the truth is, it was you, bhai.\" Raj finally looked at Adair, his voice tinged with regret.\n\n\"Bhai, I thought she would be friends with you and ignore me. That's why I lied to her. That's what I wanted to say to her.\"\n\nAdair remained motionless, his expression unchanged. Raj observed him and laughed bitterly. \"How everything has changed, bhai. We were so happy back then, playing together. The boy you called your brother‚ÄîI used to be so jealous. I was jealous of your bond with him. We share the same father, but you always wanted to be with him, and he cared for you like he was your father.\"\n\n\"So...\" Adair finally spoke, his voice low and controlled. Raj looked at him, his eyes searching.\n\n\"What changed you then?\" Adair asked, his gaze piercing.\n\n\"You still don't get it, big brother,\" Raj said, his voice thick with frustration. He stepped closer to Adair, locking eyes with him. \"One day, you came to me and said you liked a girl. You showed her to me, but you didn't even recognize her now, bhai. She is Mishti.\"\n\nAdair's eyes widened in shock. His knees buckled, and he clutched the window frame for support, his face paling. \"M-Mishti is...\" he tried to speak, but the words caught in his throat.\n\nRaj's face twisted with a mixture of anger and sadness. \"What, bhai? She's the same girl from our childhood. How could you not recognize her? From that day, I started keeping my distance from you because I liked her too. I didn't want her to be friends with anyone else.\"\n\nBut Adair wasn't listening anymore. He turned abruptly and walked out of the room, his footsteps heavy and unsteady. His mind was a whirlwind of confusion and disbelief. How could this be true? Mishti... her name is Mishti.\n\nHe pushed open the door and stumbled outside into the garden. The cool air hit him, but he barely noticed. His legs gave out, and he collapsed onto the grass, the damp earth cushioning his fall. \"Her name is Mishti,\" he whispered, his voice barely audible. Tears began to spill from his eyes, streaming down his face. He looked up at the darkening sky, his vision blurred by the tears. \"Mishti is her,\" he repeated, his voice breaking.\n\nHe leaned forward, his forehead touching the cold, wet ground. His shoulders shook with sobs, the weight of the revelation crushing him. The rain began to patter down, the first drops cool against his skin. Soon, it intensified, the raindrops drumming on him, soaking through his clothes, mingling with his tears. It was as if the heavens themselves were weeping with him, sharing in his grief and confusion.\n\nMemories flooded his mind, vivid and haunting. He saw himself as a child in Kashmir, captivated by a pair of eyes that seemed to hold the universe within them. Those eyes had etched themselves into his soul, becoming his beacon in a world of uncertainty. At that tender age, he hadn't understood the depth of his feelings, only the relentless pull towards those eyes.\n\nYears later, fate reunited them in the grandeur of the Patel villa. Adair couldn't deny the magnetic pull he felt towards Mishti's eyes, a pull that transcended mere attraction. It was after their haldi ceremony that he realized his heart had made a home for her, just like it had for those eyes in his childhood. With each passing day, she seeped into every corner of his being, her presence a soothing balm to his restless soul.\n\nHe fell for her all over again; those eyes that had lured him in, the soft contours of her face, the delicate touch of her hands, the silky strands of her hair, the radiant glow of her soul - her everything. It had merely been a month, yet it felt like he had known her for an eternity. He had grown with her, her eyes embedded into the very fabric of his existence. She was always there with him, an irreplaceable part of his life.\n\nWhen Mishti entered his life, and he thought he had forgotten those eyes. They no longer haunted his dreams or his waking thoughts because she was right there in front of him. Those eyes, the very same eyes he had once dismissed as a mere coincidence, were no longer a figment of his imagination. She was with him, in his house, the vermillion of his name adorning her forehead as a testament of their bond. She was waiting for him, sleeping beside him on the same bed they shared.\n\nNo, it couldn't be. It was just a dream, right? Such a reality seemed too surreal, too beautiful to be true. He had to be lying. The girl of his dreams, the woman who possessed those captivating eyes, couldn't possibly be his, could she?\n\n......to be continued\n\nAaj tum log questions ya doubt puch lo üôÜ‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏èüôÜ‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è\n\n(Spoilers chorkeüò§)\n\n‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî"
