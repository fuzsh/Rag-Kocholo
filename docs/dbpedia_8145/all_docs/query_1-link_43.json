It reveals the path you're meant to take, giving insights into your goals and potential impact.\n\nSoul Urge Number\n\nThe Soul Urge Number, in numerology, represents the innermost desires and motivations that drive an individual. It's derived from the vowels in a person's name and offers insights into their emotional and spiritual inclinations.\n\nGematria Value\n\nGematria is the practice of assigning a numerical value to a name, word or phrase by reading it as a number, or sometimes by using an alphanumerical cipher."
