        "meta_description": "There’s a common saying in North Indian households when girl childs are born into the family. They say ‘Lakshmi Ghar Aayi He’. My parents also said the same thing, cheering with joy, when I was born into the family 22 years ago in a small town in the state of Punjab. At that time, they were filled with bright hopes for my future. But when I turned two and all the similar-aged toddlers around me had started walking, I was still way behind. As any anxious parents would do in a similar situation, they decided to consult with a doctor. The diagnosis they received was nowhere close to what they had prepared themselves for.",

        "text": "While at school, I never got the opportunity to attend coaching or other extracurricular courses due to my physiotherapy sessions. I had to work hard to manage my studies myself and this helped me to strengthen my foundation in academics. I had always been one of the top students in my classes. Another challenge that I faced came in the form of my peers from my school and college days. My cerebral palsy meant that my peers tended to underestimate me. They would tell me to sit aside and that they could do it themselves. These instances would hit me internally every time.\n\nEven while going through four major surgeries, I never lost hope, determined to manage my academics and all the other things around me. After my 12th, I was selected by one of the best colleges, Hansraj College (Delhi University). If I chose to attend, I would have to leave home, since the college was some distance away from my home. When I was feeling confused and nervous, my Dad came up to me and said, \"Whatever your decision is, we are always with you\". That was the turning point that led me to spreading open my wings to fly toward the heights that awaited me. Being that it was the first time that I had stayed away from my family, I did face some challenges.\n\nDuring my graduation, along with excelling in my studies, I also found time to do a number of certification courses, live projects, and even internships. A notable achievement was that I received an offer letter for a full-time job role from a top-rated company. However, I wanted to go for further studies and specifically for CAT. It was a roller coaster ride, as CAT was one of the most challenging management exams. I failed on my first attempt, but I chose to learn from this and tried again. In my second try, I scored very well and finally got admitted to one of the most prestigious institutes for management, IIM Rohtak.\n\nI would like to leave you with the lessons that I had learned during my journey so far. A major lesson was that nothing is impossible. The realization that every tough scenario had a silver lining hidden somewhere and I just needed to find it, helped me confront the tough times that I had faced. I firmly believe in the saying, ‘God helps those who help themselves and I am determined to help myself and confront any difficulties with fortitude. I also strongly believe in Karma. There is nothing anyone can do about it. Every day, I strive to be the best version of myself by focusing solely on what I can control. I hope to inspire more people around me so everyone can put their best foot forward, make bold decisions, and take risks. I am always ready to soar because the sky awaits me. There is still so much to discover and new life experiences to gain. In the future, I will be well-equipped to fly higher with the knowledge I have gained from my family and IIM Rohtak."
