There are a few lesser-used GST rates such as 3% and 0.25%.\n\nAlso, the composition taxable persons must pay GST at lower or nominal rates such as 1.5% or 5% or 6% on their turnover. There is a concept of TDS and TCS under GST as well, whose rates are 2% and 1% respectively.\n\nThese are the total GST rate of IGST for interstate supply or the addition of both CGST and SGST for intrastate supply. The GST rates shall be multiplied by the assessable value of the supply to arrive at the GST amounts in a tax invoice.\n\nFurther, the GST law levies cess in addition to the above GST rates on the sale of some items such as cigarettes, tobacco, aerated water, petrol, and motor vehicles, rates widely varying from 1% to 204%.\n\nThe GST rate structure for some of the commonly-used consumable products is given in the below table.
