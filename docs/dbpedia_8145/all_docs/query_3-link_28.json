        "text": "\"Confessing your feelings to the most important person of your life is the biggest gamble ever because either you are going to get everything you have wanted or you will lose everything you have never wanted to lose.\"\n\nSorry for uploading the next chapter very late. In case you forgot the story, kindly read the previous chapter once.\n\nA happy birthday treat from my side to all my readers. Enjoy... üíï\n\n__________________________________________\n\nRajvansh House\n\nMeenakshi observed both Mishti and Abir today in the breakfast table. She noticed that they both were behaving a bit weird and they both were stealing some glances of each other while having their breakfast. Meenakshi looked tensed after seeing their growing bonding with each other and what surprised her the most that Abir let had Mishti entered into his room and they were talking with each other very comfortably for a long time. Meenakshi hadn't seen her son talking to girl a like this after the demise of Prerna.\n\nDoes Abir like that girl? If it is, then I have to know every details of her. Sister of Kuhu is not enough for me. I need to know everything about her present and past!!!! Meenakshi thought.\n\nHello, Laxman, I want some information about a girl.... Meenakshi called her most trusted informer.\n\nYes, madam, just tell me her name! All the information about that girl will be in front of you within a week!!! Laxman replied.\n\nOk, come to my house in 20 minutes!!!Meenakshi ordered and Laxman reached there before 20minutes.\n\nMadam, I am here... Laxman spoke up.\n\nGood you came early. I want all the details and information about my daughter in law Kuhu's elder sister Mishti; Mishti Maheshwari as soon as possible! Its urgent and important... Meenakshi told Laxman. She was unaware of Mishti's real surname.\n\nKuhu mam's elder sister! Are you sure madam??? Laxman looked confused.\n\nDo what I had asked you to do. No more questions. Now leave and start gathering information that girl, asap!!! Meenakshi angrily looked at Laxman.\n\nOk, madam!!! Laxman nodded and left from there.\n\nIn a cafe\n\nMishti and Abir had decided to go to a cafe nearby as she asked Abir to have lunch with her out side of the NGO. But Mishti looking lost as she was thinking about the outcome when she will tell Abir about her past. Abir and Mishti reached the cafe. He saw Mishti was absentminded. He shooked her and he came back into senses.\n\nMishti are you ok..??? Abir asked her.\n\nYeah I am absolutely fine. What will happen to me! I'm fine, don't worry!!!Mishti replied in a haste.\n\nAre you sure?? No, I mean if you want then we can go home for having lunch... Abir looked at her with a frown. He wasn't convinced yet.\n\nYes, I am ok! Relax.... Mishti was looking here and there.\n\nOkay then, you go inside. I will just park the car there and then come inside!!! Abir told her."
