        "text": "My Story\n\nMishti, a 17-year-old girl, is a resident of Bihar. She is the eldest one in her family, and she had 2 younger sisters. Despite appearing like any other kid, she and her sisters had gone through a lot of trauma and abuse in their upbringing. Father considered it a curse as he had only girls, and one of the constant fights was over the reason that their mother was not able to bear a male child.\n\nHer mother had passed away in June 2016 due to illness. The stepmother was not pleased with Mishti and her sisters. Things got worse when the stepmother became pregnant and gave birth to a son. Both parents became abusive towards the daughters.\n\nAt the time IGP social workers met her, she had dropped out of school for over a year. Father wanted Mishti to get married to a 40-year-old guy, who was from a well-to-do family. The IGP social workers gave counseling to her father and made him realize the importance of education. She started to work in a textile shop as a part-time job and went to school.\n\nIf you choose to sponsor Mishti, you will play a part in providing her with the opportunity to create a better life for herself. Under IGP’s care, she will receive a strong education, the ability to have a better childhood, and consistent care for her needs. With your help, Mishti will begin to know that she is loved and valued."
