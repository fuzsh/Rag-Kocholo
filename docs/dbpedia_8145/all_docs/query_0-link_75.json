        "text": "Kalijeera / Gobindobhog Rice\n\nLast weekend, on my drive back from the desert, I took a long detour and went grocery shopping at Aladin in LA. That is the only place where I get some authentic Bengali/ Bangladeshi ingredients - like fragrant gawa ghee, bori , tal misri , kuler achaar (sweet and spicy jujube pickle), Bengal Delta 's fresh water fish, good quality young mutton, sweets, and special rice. I did not buy any fish and mutton this time, but I did buy two 8lb bags of kalijeera rice, they will last me years, I think.This long post is about rice.

First we will talk science, then about what you can do to prevent curdling, and then a strategy if your yogurt sauce curdles and you need to bring it back to life. Hope this will be beneficial to you. Science of Milk and Yogurt Remember the nursery rhyme we used to sing: \" Little Miss Muffet, she sat on her tuffet, eating her curds eating and whey.... \" While there are many different types of proteins in milk, we can divide the proteins into two classes: Curds and Whey. They are different in how they react to acids. Some of the curd proteins, called caseins (read more here) , coagulate (clump up in solids) in the presence of acids. Whey proteins, on the other hand, do not coagulate in presence of acid. Special microbes often convert the milk's sugar into acid, which then creates curds and whey, resu"
