        "text": "What is Native Milk?\n\nNative Milk Stands for pure unadulterated A2 milk from happy desi cows. Native Milk is delicious, nutritious and completely natural A2 cows’ milk that many people find easier to digest. Native Milk has one small but significant difference as compared to different brands. Different cows naturally produce milk with different protein structures. We have our own farm with 94 Gir cows. During the white revolution, India embarked on increasing the capacity of milk production by increasing the proportion of Jersey cows (A1 milk) at the cost of Native breeds (A2 milk). We are trying to create awareness about the right kind of milk to be consumed i.e. A2 milk by this venture.\n\nWhat is the difference between A1 and A2 Milk?\n\nBeta Casein is about 30% of the total protein content of the milk. Indian Desi Cow contains A2 beta-casein, while HF/Jersey cow milk contains A1 Beta casein. Research suggests A1 milk consumption is linked to several medical issues - Heart disease, immunity loss in children, bone density reduction in women, autism, lactose intolerance etc. A2 milk is easily digestible. It is a rich source of vitamins and antioxidants. It boosts immunity and reduces the risk of cancer.\n\nHow do I know this is genuinely A2 milk?\n\nWe are one of the few brands in India which have got an A2 milk certification from the only A2 certified lab in India. The certificate is uploaded on our website and also we plan to arrange customer visits to our farm post monsoons this year. Visit - https://www.nativemilk.co.in/\n\nHow fresh is this milk?\n\nOur milk is as good as having your own Gir cow at home. We chill the milk immediately after milking to avoid any form of bacterial growth and also to maintain freshness and quality. We also marginally pasteurise the milk (not at ultra-high temperature) taking care that the constitution of the milk is preserved. The milk comes straight from the udder of the cow to your doorstep in 12 hours flat.\n\nWhat is the processing method of this milk- pasteurised or homogenised or raw? What is the shelf life? Do I need to boil the milk?\n\nWe ONLY pasteurise the milk at 85 degrees which is equal to kitchen boiling and hence preserves the nutrient profile of the milk. This results in a shelf life of only 2 days and we request you to boil the milk within 2-3 hours from delivery and refrigerate and consume within 2 days.\n\nWhat is the FAT content of Native Milk?\n\nWe don’t take out any FAT and provide full-fat milk. The fat from Gir cows milk is the key ingredient that is so beneficial for health. We are one of the highest FAT content Cow milk in Maharashtra with a label fat of 4.1.\n\nWhat are other health benefits of this milk?\n\nRead this article for more information 1. http://www.nature.com/ejcn/journal/v59/n5/full/1602104a.html?foxt rotcallback=true 2. http://food.ndtv.com/food-drinks/a1-versus-a2-milk-does-it-matter- 1414225 3. http://saveindiancows.org/benefits-of-drinking-pure-desi-cow-milk/ 4. https://youtu.be/EUkxuEedxBc\n\nIs Native Milk good for children?\n\nDesi Cow’s milk contains all the nutrients associated with A2 milk. Good minerals such as calcium build strong bones and teeth for growing children. It’s a complete food. It carries vitamin A and D. A2 milk is easily digestible and a rich source of vitamins and antioxidants that boosts immunity and reduces the risk of cancer.\n\nIs A2 milk suitable for small children?\n\nDoctors recommend full cream milk for children over 12 months and low-fat milk, for children over the age of two. However, people (including children) with a medically diagnosed allergy to cows’ milk protein or lactose should not drink native milk or any other natural cows’ milk.\n\nWhat type of cows you have in your farm?\n\nWe have our own farm with 94 gir cows in the outskirts of Pune around Uruli kanchan. These are native breeds and provide pure A2 milk\n\nDo you use any chemicals or growth hormones to increase milk production?\n\nNo, we don't use any chemicals or growth hormones.\n\nWhat type of feeds you use?\n\nWe use natural fodders (grown locally), cattle feeds, and minerals. The partner farms also have forested areas closeby wherein our cows feed through the day\n\nAre your cows free range? How do you milk the Cows?\n\nOur cows are free range and forest fed. The balance nutrients are fed at our farms to ensure a balanced diet. Since desi cows are not accustomed to machine milking, our cows are lovingly hand milked in hygienic settings\n\nHow do you handle sick cows?\n\nSick cows are quarantined and treated until they are cured. We don't use milk from diseased cows.\n\nCan I get buffalo milk?\n\nNo. Currently we don't produce buffalo milk. Probably in future.\n\nIs your milk organic?\n\nOrganic milk needs the soil on which the cows are grazing to be certified organic and it takes 3 years of monitoring to be provided a certification.
