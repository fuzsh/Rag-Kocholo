Also, this post may help you to learn the process of making the perfect Misti Doi at home!\n\nJump to:\n\nTricks of making perfect Mishti Doi\n\nWhat is so special about the famous Laal Doi aka Misti Doi\n\nMishti Doi Recipe (Bengali Sweet Yogurt Recipe) from Debjanir Rannaghar\n\nRecipe Card\n\nBengali Sweet Yogurt Mishti Doi Recipe Video\n\nBengali Dessert Recipes from Debjanir Rannaghar\n\nHave you tried the Bengali Mishti Doi recipe from Debjanir Rannaghar!\n\nHere's the authentic mishti doi Recipe Pin for your Pinterest Board!\n\nAll thanks to Maa, I have come up with the Bengali Mishti Doi recipe. Maa is at my place and will be staying for a few more days. I have been capturing a few cooking videos all thanks to her for my YouTube channel \"Debjanir Rannaghar\". It's kind of overwhelming while working along with maa. She is teaching me a lot.\n\nTricks of making perfect Mishti Doi\n\nWhen I asked Maa the other day \"let's make authentic Mishti Doi\" she replied \"Didi used to make amazing misti doi! In our joint family of more than 20 people, it was a regular affair. You know the main trick was to boil milk along with water for a longer time. The more you boil; the more you'll get the perfect texture.\" She then asked whether I remember the earthen stove (Unun) or not. according to maa, the slow cooking on the Unun using coal was another reason for getting the brilliant aroma of Doi apart from using an earthen pot to set it. Maa then talked about the process of using caramel to make the doi red, which according to her a comparatively new process that Maa loves to follow.\n\nWhat is so special about the famous Laal Doi aka Misti Doi\n\nWhen it comes to Bengali desserts, the quintessential Lal Mishti Doi needs no further introduction. The Bengali-style Yogurt fermented with sugar is one of a kind. The store-bought Misti doi though is delectable, however, similar (or even better) is prepared in Bengali homes quite regularly. This is a richer version of Doi and is also known as Lal Doi, Chakku Doi, and Kheer Doi.\n\nVariations: One Mishti Doi; different names\n\nAs I mentioned, Mishti Doi is known as Lal Doi, Chakku Doi, and Kheer Doi as well. Lal stands for red, and there are two varieties of Misti Doi, one completely white known as Shada doi, and another a bit reddish (because of the caramel used), known as laal doi. This doi is rich and thick in texture and hence, got another name, Chakku Doi. Chakku came from chak (or knife) and the way a thick piece can be extracted from the Doi. Last but not the least, Kheer doi. The milk is thickened in this version to make reduced milk and then the culture is added. The end result is a richer version of doi as thick as Kheer, hence the name.\n\nMishti Doi Recipe (Bengali Sweet Yogurt Recipe) from Debjanir Rannaghar\n\nPrint\n\nRecipe Card\n\nclock clock iconcutlery cutlery iconflag flag iconfolder folder iconinstagram instagram iconpinterest pinterest iconfacebook facebook iconprint print iconsquares squares iconheart heart iconheart solid heart solid icon\n\nBengali Mishti Doi | Laal Doi\n\n5 Stars 4 Stars 3 Stars 2 Stars 1 Star\n\nNo reviews\n\nAuthor: Debjani Chatterjee Alam\n\nTotal Time: 8 hours 35 minutes\n\nYield: 5 Portions 1x\n\nDescription\n\nMishti Doi is a signature Bengali Dessert and to make it as perfect as the confectioner's shop aka Mishtir Dokan you must follow the tricks properly!\n\n1-liter Full-cream Milk\n\n100g Milk Powder\n\n150ml Water\n\n1 Tbsp. Ghee\n\n100g Sugar\n\n2 Tbsp. Plain Yogurt (to be used as a culture to set the Doi)\n\nCook Mode Prevent your screen from going dark\n\nInstructions\n\nI will show how to make authentic Bengali Mishti Doi aka Lal Doi following three methods; setting it naturally; using stove-top and also Mishti Doi making in Oven.\n\nTake 100g Sugar in a heavy-duty pan; keep the flame on the higher side.\n\nAdd 2 Tbsp. Water.\n\nLet the caramel form and stir in between.\n\nIt will take around 2 minutes to melt the sugar.\n\nThe Sugar after melting will turn Brown in color.\n\nNow add 1 cup water and mix vigorously.\n\nThis syrup is responsible for the typical red color of Lal Doi aka Mishti Doi;\n\nIf you wish to make white doi; do not caramelize sugar but add it while boiling the milk.\n\nTo make prefer Mishti Doi (perfect texture) do not add sugar after boiling the milk; instead cook it along with the milk\n\nNow add 100ml Milk and mix properly.\n\nLet it boil,\n\nNow add a mixture of 900ml full-cream milk and 100ml water.\n\nAdd 1 Tbsp. Ghee as well. It will help in setting the top of Mishti Doi Properly.\n\nNow reduce the flame and cook for around 20 minutes.\n\nWater is a very important ingredient for this recipe; the water will help to cook for a longer time.\n\nNow add 100g Milk powder and mix.\n\nBoil the mixture for 10 minutes on a low flame.\n\nScrap the sides of the pan where malai is forming and mix with the milk in between\n\nOnce the mixture reduces to ¾th switch the flame off; do not reduce the milk in excess\n\nNow take a ladle and run it through the milk to form foam\n\nDo it for 2 minutes;\n\nBy this time the milk will be at the right temperature to add the culture\n\nCheck with your finger; if you can put it through; the milk is good to go; not too much hot neither cold but lukewarm\n\nTake 2 Tbsp. plain curd as culture (Sanjha) if you are making Mishti Doi in summer (Indian summer); in the winter double the amount.\n\nMix with a spoon to smooth it.\n\nNow take 1 ladle full of milk from the milk mixture and mix with the culture.\n\nAdd this to the milk.\n\nGive a final mix with the ladle; do not overmix while adding the culture.\n\nSetting Mishti Doi Naturally\n\nIt is better to use big earthen pot for setting the doi naturally.\n\nPour the mixture.\n\nCover the pot with a lid and place in a warm place for 8 hours; the Bangali Mishti doi will set properly\n\nIn the winter place it within a casserole to set.\n\nSetting Misti Doi on Stove-top\n\nTake the mixture in an earthen pot.\n\nOn the stovetop, on low flame place a deep-bottom bowl and place a stand.\n\nNow place the earthen pot and cover with a lid and keep it on low flame for 15 minutes.\n\nIt will set within 4-5 hours depending on the temperature.\n\nSetting Mishti Doi on Oven\n\nTake the mixture in a Ceramic bowl or glass bowl or you can use an earthen pot as well.\n\nIn the oven/ OTG: place the bowl in a pre-heated oven at 180 degrees C for 15 minutes; this process will also help in setting the cur in reduced time.\n\nBefore Serving\n\nOnce set, refrigerate Mishti Doi for 2 hours.\n\nNotes\n\nTo make perfect Mishti Doi you must consider a few things; consistency of milk, amount of culture (Sanjha) used in making the doi, and also temperature.\n\nTo set authentic Mishti doi try to use Earthen pot. The pot not only soak extra moisture but also provides an amazing earthy aroma to the Mishti Doi\n\nPrep Time: 5 min\n\nSet Time: 8 hours\n\nCook Time: 30 min\n\nCategory: Dessert\n\nMethod: cooking\n\nCuisine: Bengali\n\nNutrition\n\nServing Size: 150g\n\nCalories: 382\n\nSugar: 51.7g\n\nSodium: 338mg\n\nFat: 8.6g\n\nSaturated Fat: 5.2g\n\nCarbohydrates: 54.4g\n\nFiber: 0g\n\nProtein: 23.5g\n\nCholesterol: 37mg\n\nRecipe Card powered by\n\nBengali Sweet Yogurt Mishti Doi Recipe Video\n\nHave you tried the Bengali Mishti Doi recipe from Debjanir Rannaghar!\n\nI would love to see a picture if you are making it following my recipe which you can share here at dolonchttrj@gmail.com.
