        "text": "Meristematic Tissue Definition\n\nWhat is Meristematic Tissue?\n\nCarl Wilhelm von Nägeli coined the term “meristem.” Meristematic tissue contains undifferentiated cells, which are the building blocks of the specialized plant structures.\n\nMeristematic tissues contain living cells with varied shapes. They possess a large nucleus devoid of the vacuole. The cells have no intercellular space. The zone where these cells exist is known as meristem.\n\nThe cells of the meristematic tissue divide actively to form specialized structures such as buds of leaves and flowers, tips of roots and shoots, etc. These cells help to increase the length and girth of the plant.\n\nLet us have a detailed look at the characteristics and types of meristematic tissue.\n\nCharacteristics of Meristematic Tissue\n\nThe characteristics of meristematic tissue are as follows:\n\nThe cells of these tissues are commonly called meristems.\n\nThe meristematic tissue has the quality of self-renewal. Every time the cell divides, one cell remains identical to the parent cell, and the others form specialized structures.\n\nThey have very small and few vacuoles.\n\nThe meristematic tissue is living and thin-walled.\n\nThe protoplasm of the cells is very dense.\n\nThe meristematic tissues heal the wounds of an injured plant.\n\nThe cells of the meristematic tissue are young and immature.\n\nThey do not store food.\n\nThey exhibit a very high metabolic activity.\n\nThey possess a single, large and prominent nucleus.\n\nTypes of Meristematic Tissue\n\nThe meristematic tissue is of the following types:\n\nMeristematic Tissue On the basis of Origin\n\nPromeristem\n\nThe earliest and youngest meristematic tissue.\n\nIt originates from the embryo.\n\nThe primary meristem arises from the promeristem.\n\nIt is found in the root and the shoot tips.\n\nPrimary Meristem\n\nIt arises from the promeristem.\n\nCells divide actively.\n\nIt is present below the promeristem and forms the permanent tissue.\n\nSecondary Meristem\n\nIt originates from the primary meristem.\n\nThe permanent tissue forms from the secondary meristem.\n\nMeristematic Tissue On the Basis of Position\n\nApical Meristem\n\nThese are present at the tips of the roots and shoots and helps in the increase of the height of the plants.\n\nVarious cell divisions facilitate the growth of the cells in the roots and shoots and help in cellular enlargement.\n\nApical meristem is divided into-promeristem zone, which contains actively dividing cells, and the meristematic zone, which contains protoderm, procambium and ground meristem.\n\nIntercalary Meristem\n\nIt is located in the leaves and internodes at the intercalary position.\n\nThese help to increase the length of the internode.\n\nIt is found in grass, monocots and pines.\n\nIt is a part of apical meristem and adds to the height of the plant.\n\nLateral Meristem\n\nIt is located in the stems and roots on the lateral side.\n\nIt increases the thickness of the plant.\n\nVascular cambium and cork cambium are the two lateral meristems.\n\nThese divide preclinically or radially and give rise to secondary permanent tissues.\n\nMeristematic Tissue On the Basis of Function\n\nProtoderm\n\nIt is the outermost plant tissue and forms the epidermis.\n\nProcambium\n\nGround Meristem\n\nThe meristematic tissue is usually found in the apices of the root systems and the shoots and is in a continuous state of division.\n\nThis was a brief overview of the meristematic tissue.
