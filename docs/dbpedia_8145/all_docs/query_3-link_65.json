        "text": "Mishti Doi is a nostalgia for many of us who live outside West Bengal. Though we get Mishti Doi from different brands these days but nothing can bring back the taste of the Mishti Doi of Kolkata. The taste that comes from the caramel, the creamy, dreamy sweet yogurt which has a prominent sour after taste is something so heavenly that cannot be expressed in words. Mishti Doi is more than a dessert to Bengalis, itâ€™s a part of our culture and traditions.\n\nI was told by a trusted sweet seller in Kolkata that they mix vegetable shortening in the yogurt mixture to get a thick upper layer of Mishti Doi which we usually love to eat. I donâ€™t use shortening when I make Mishti Doi at home. So, you might miss that thick shop like layer at the top here. But I and my family loved the version I make at home, itâ€™s worth all the effort. I hope youâ€™ll enjoy trying this recipe and donâ€™t forget to share your experience with me. ðŸ™‚"
