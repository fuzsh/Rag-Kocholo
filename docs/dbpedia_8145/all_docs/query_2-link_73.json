        "text": "Food of West Bengal- Delectable Bengali Cuisines That You Must Try!\n\nWest Bengal is famous for an array of things, and one of the most important of them is food. The mouth-watering Rosogullas, Chomchom, and Rasamalai, the super tasty Sorshe Ilish and Chingri Macher Malai Curry and but a few of the mouthwatering and tempting food of the highly illustrated and exquisite Bengali cuisine.\n\nHere are 15 Dishes of Bengali Food that you must try:\n\n1. Aloo Potol Posto\n\nMake a mental note, Bengalis love poppy seeds. They really do and why won't they, it makes food so much tastier! This preparation above is also made of poppy or Posto as the Bengalis like to call it. It is a preparation of Posto with potatoes and pointed gourd, complete with red and green chillies and sometimes coconut puree to add some much-needed spice to it. It truly is one of the classic Bengali dishes and famous food of West Bengal!\n\n2. Ilish Macher Jhol\n\nOne of the much-favoured fishes in the region, Hilsa or ilish fish curry is something that you have got to try your hands on. The pungent smelling curry prepared with Nigella seeds and chilli to give it the required balance that makes it so perfect. You have got to try this one as it one of the staple food of West Bengal.\n\n3. Shukto\n\nWho said Bengalis are all for fish and nothing else? Well, Bengalis do know how to do their vegetables too. And Shukto is just an example. Usually served as the first course of a diet, Shukto is a combination of different vegetables like Brinjals, Bitter Gourd, Crunchy Drumsticks and Bori (a Bengali speciality again). Mixed with grounded spices and milk to make a thick curry, this is a perfect way to start a meal.\n\n4. Sandesh\n\nThe most popular sweet from the Bengali state, this dish is made of khoya, a version of condensed milk and is heavenly in taste. This sweet is neither overly sweet thus allowing people with a non-sweet tooth to enjoy too. One should definitely try this delectable West Bengal food item.\n\n5. Mutton Biryani\n\nAlthough made famous in various parts of the country, each marked with unique cooking techniques and spices; one should also try this taste in this part of the country. Filled with the rich aroma of spices and ghee, the mutton biryani is simply heaven. Juicy, tender pieces of mutton, fried with the biryani on a Tava, this yummy recipe is a must-try.\n\n6. Aam Pora Shorbot\n\nA drink made of chilled water, burnt raw mangoes and sugar, it is an instant relief that you will get on a sweltering summer afternoon (and with the Kolkata heat you might as well require it). The raw mangoes are burnt, but only partially, with the skin a bit charred which lends a smoky taste to the drink.

It is most commonly eaten with Luchi, another Bengali delicacy.\n\n9. Luchi\n\nA deep-fry delicacy, no Bengali household can ever complete a celebration without Luchis. Prepared with maida instead of the atta flour which is used to make chapattis, this delicacy looks like smaller sized, fluffy, deep-fried chapattis, with a golden glow. The crispy Luchis are a mandate for all the important small celebrations that take place in the Bengali household.\n\n10. Chholar Dal\n\nOne of the Bengali's favourite dals, this dish is made with chana dal as the main ingredient. With its slightly sweet and spicy taste, the dal is perfect to eat with rice or Luchis.
