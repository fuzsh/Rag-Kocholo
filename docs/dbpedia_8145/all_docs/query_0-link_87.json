        "text": "Summers are upon us and unlike the north Indian summers, that are dry and intense, the summers at this coastal city are hot and humid. The level of physical discomfort is way higher due to high levels of humidity and I find it physically exhausting since the air becomes rich in moisture thereby making it heavier to breathe. I happen to tire out much faster than I used do in the Delhi heat. So, the aim during these two months till monsoon, is to avoid cooking during the day and try and finish the day’s cooking chores in the early morning hours. We stick to seasonal produce and keep it simple during summers. Grilled food, salads, light meals help us sail through the season. While the natural coolers become our saviours, keeping our appetites going, ice creams and chilled dessert become our comfort food. Mishti Doi is one of those desserts that are healthy with probiotic goodness of yogurt that not only helps keep the body cool but also keeps the digestion healthy. Try these popsicles or consume them as Doi this summer. They are sugar free as I used date palm jaggery which gives it a nice mellow sweetness that is not over powering. Besides that I add a drizzled of date syrup before serving…nutritious and delicious! You can go the traditional way for making this yogurt (which is, to reduce milk, set it using cultured yogurt and then use it for the recipe) or take the easier and simpler way and use hung yogurt (also called yogurt cream) or use Greek yogurt for this recipe.\n\n350 gm Thick Yogurt\n\n1/3 C + 4 tbsp scrapped, Date Palm Jaggery (it is not intensely sweet like the regular jaggery), adjust to taste\n\n1 – 2 tbsp Water\n\n½ tsp Cardamom Powder\n\n1 – 2 tbsp Nuts of your choice\n\nIn a sauce pan, mix one tablespoons of water with jaggery and stir till the jaggery melts (use more water only if required). Remove from heat and strain the mixture through a muslin cloth to remove any impurities.\n\nLightly whisk the yogurt and add the jaggery mix and cardamom powder.\n\nAdd finely chopped nuts of your choice.\n\nPour the yogurt carefully in ice cream moulds and insert the stick in the centre.\n\nFreeze the moulds for at least 4 – 5 hours or till the yogurt is set.\n\nUnmould the popsicles by dipping the mould in warm water for a few seconds.\n\nDrizzle with date syrup (optional) and garnish with nuts.\n\nServe immediately. Enjoy!\n\nNote – Feel free to use the sweetner of your choice but Mishti Doi traditionally uses jaggery (and when in season, date palm jaggery is used).\n\nNote – You will need to add a little more sweetness than required, as the sweetness seems to reduce once the yogurt freezes.\n\nServes – 5\n\nThanks for your visit and see you soon again with another exciting recipe!"
