This is what I know:\n\nRajshri and Vishambar Maheshwari have two offsprings- Akshara and Shaurya. Akshara got married to Naitik Singhania. Akshara and Naitik have two offsprings- Naira and Naksh. Naitik mother's passed away and then Naitik's father decided to remarry another woman (forgot her name). That woman was a divorcee and had been married before to some other man with whom she had two offsprings- Naman and (a daughter whose name I don't remember). When Naitik's father got remarried to that woman, that woman's children from previous marriage i.e. Naman and her daughter also moved in to the Singhania household. Later, Naman got married to Karishma and gave birth to Mishti. Mishti is Naira's (current lead of YRKKH) step paternal cousin. Shaurya got married to Varsha but had an illegitimate daughter i.e. Kuhu with a woman named Sneha. Varsha accepted Kuhu as her own daughter. Kuhu is Naira's maternal cousin. Rajshri is Naira's maternal grandmother.\n\nLater, Naman tried to kill his step brother Naitik for money. Naman got jailed after that which scarred Mishti for life. Mishti's mother Karishma left her and got remarried. Mishti was still staying in the Singhania household. Naman would try to revisit the Singhanias and create problems in the lives of the Singhanias due to his daughter's presence in their home. It was then that Mishti's grandmother (Naitik's stepmom) decided to hand her over to the Maheshwaris. The Maheshwaris accepted her and took good care of her. Rajshri and Vishambar were mother and father figures to Mishti in her adolescent stages of growing up and hence she calls them Badi Maa and Bade Papa.\n\nI hope this cleared your doubts.\n\nOriginally posted by: socioboss9797\n\nI haven't wathed YRKKH but I dug up the background of the Maheshwaris before watching the show.
