Actor-comedian Rick Moranis parlayed his turn on the groundbreaking Canadian sketch comedy series "SCTV" (Global/CBC/NBC/Superchannel, 1976-1984) into a decade-long string of starring roles in popular Hollywood comedies, including "Ghostbusters" (1984), "Honey, I Shrunk the Kids" (1989) and "The Flintstones" (1994). Bespectacled and unassuming in appearance, Moranis was a natural for socially awkward characters whose strength and charisma were visible only after serious challenges ensued, though his most popular role was that of the supernaturally dense Bob McKenzie, one half of the beer-swilling McKenzie Brothers, who debuted on "SCTV" and later earned their own feature, "Strange Brew" (1983). After the death of his wife in 1991, Moranis retired from acting, but emerged in 2005 as an unlikely country singer on the Grammy-nominated "Agorophobic Cowboy." His "SCTV" heritage, along with his best films, made Moranis among the best-regarded television and movie comics of the 1980s and 1990s.
