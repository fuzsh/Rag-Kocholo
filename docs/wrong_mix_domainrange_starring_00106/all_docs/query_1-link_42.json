        "text": "So on the way to my 2 hour comute to work here in the lovely Garden State :veryconfu I was listening to the radio and they were talking about Ghostbusters 3. Commingsoon.net has confirmed part of this, in that the move is supposed to be about the 4 original (same actors) Ghostbusters trianing the next generation of Ghostbusters. They said that the cast would include.\n\nZach Ephron\n\nShie LaBeouf\n\nJonah Hill aka fat kid from Superbad\n\nSean Patrick Thomas (Afrian American Actor who was in Save the last Dance)\n\nNone of these actors have been confirmed but just wanted to see what you guys think. Maybe it wont be that bad but Id much rather see a movie about just the original 4. But the studios probaly want to make sequels.\n\nI recently heard about Ghostbuster3 and that the 4 original members had all resigned. (Ghostbuster wise that is...Rick Moranis will probably not be returning).\n\nThe plot you mention is only rumor last I checked. When I read about it they said that the plot might involve having them train a newer group of Ghostbusters, but the actual storyline has yet to be released.\n\nI would hope that Universal or whoever is putting this movie out does not go with that secondary cast. That list seems more like a teenagers dream movie, than an actual cast. Maybe it'll happen, but it would probably take a good bit of money to sign those kids..let alone what they are paying the original four.\n\nPersonally, I think they should just stick with the original four and maybe throw in one or two others for training, but I think they should go with little lesser known actors (or hit up SNL for some of their younger talent).\n\nSo on the way to my 2 hour comute to work here in the lovely Garden State :veryconfu I was listening to the radio and they were talking about Ghostbusters 3.
