        "text": "By Rudie Obias |\n\nIt seems like Ghostbusters 3 is always close to starting production, and then something happens to prevent the film from finding the light of day. While it appears that Dan Aykroyd is trying everything in his power to get the project off the ground, recent rumors suggest that it’s closer than it ever has been to getting a green light from Sony.\n\nAccording to SchmoesKnow.com, Sony is looking to cast Emma Stone and Jonah Hill for the third installment in the Ghostbusters film series. They will allegedly play characters named Anna and Jeremy. Dare we hope that Dan Aykroyd might finally get Ghostbusters 3 into theaters?\n\nEmma Stone and Jonah Hill appeared together in the buddy comedy Superbad in 2008. Since then, their careers have taken off in Hollywood, with Hill being nominated for an Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor in the film Moneyball, while Emma Stone has a solid gig as Gwen Stacy in Marc Webb’s Amazing Spider-Man film series. Jonah Hill would be awesome in a new Ghostbusters film, and hopefully he’ll bring his buddies James Franco, Seth Rogen, Craig Robinson, Danny McBride, Jay Baruchel, and Michael Cera along with him. As for Emma Stone, she’s wonderful and has chemistry with virtually anyone playing opposite her, even Jonah Hill and Jesse Eisenberg.\n\nGhostbusters 3 has been in development hell with false starts and rewrites since the release of Ghostbusters 2, way back in 1992. One of the big reasons why Ghostbusters 3 hasn’t gotten off the ground yet was that Aykroyd was trying to get his buddy Bill Murray back in the jumpsuit. Murray has been very playful with the rumors that Murray would or would not appear in Ghostbusters 3, or even that he might just do a cameo as a ghost.\n\nThere are no confirmed plot details about GB3, but according to Aykroyd the film might feature a dimensional rift that would open in the middle of New York City. Naturally, the Ghostbusters would be called in to stop all the scary beasts from overtaking the Earth. Aykroyd even has plans for a Ghostbusters 4 that would possibly involve the team going to Hell. Let’s see if Ghostbusters 3 can get started before we start talking too much about Ghostbusters 4, which would most likely open in theaters in 2035."
