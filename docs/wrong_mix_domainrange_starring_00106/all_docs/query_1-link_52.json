        "text": "Welcome to WatchMojo, and today we’re counting down our picks for the scenes in comedy films that we always come back to when we need a good laugh. What comedy scene gets you LOLing every single time? Let us know in the comments.\n\n#30: “I’m a God”\n\n“Groundhog Day” (1993)\n\nAfter many great collaborations, this movie marked the end of the relationship between director Harold Ramis and actor Bill Murray. The two butted heads on the project, as Ramis’ focus was on the comedy while Murray wanted to give the philosophical elements more weight in the film. In the end, it’s the melding of them both that makes the movie so good – and the “I’m a God” scene is a wonderful, rewatchable example of exactly that. It’s very funny watching Murray take Andie MacDowell through the diner, telling her details about everyone there. But the philosophical undercurrent, and his attempt to come to terms with his possible omnipotence, adds a hint of sadness and desperation to it all.\n\n#29: STRIKE!\n\n“The Naked Gun: From the Files of Police Squad!” (1988)\n\nThere is so much word play and great physical comedy in 1988’s “The Naked Gun” that you’re probably going to want to rewatch the whole movie more often than not. But, if you only have a couple minutes and you need a laugh, this has got to be one of the scenes most folks come back to again and again. Leslie Nielsen is Lieutenant Frank Drebin, and in this scene he’s gone undercover as an umpire to try and foil an assassination attempt on the Queen. After the first pitch is thrown Drebin is hesitant to make the call. But when his “strike” call gets a roar of approval from the crowd he sure doesn’t hesitate anymore.\n\n#28: “Jingle Bell Rock”\n\n“Mean Girls” (2004)\n\nSure, some people will want to rewatch this scene just because it features four beautiful actresses in sexy Santa costumes. However, for most of us, the desire to see it again and again comes down to the laughs it generates - from the shocked parents in the audience to Amy Poehler’s hysterical shadow dancing in the aisle. There’s also Lindsay Lohan’s character Cady Heron saving the day with her quick thinking and smooth singing voice. Seeing her get a win over mean girl Regina – well, that also puts a smile on our face.\n\n#27: Harry’s Bathroom Scene\n\n“Dumb and Dumber” (1994)\n\nAs a kid, just saying the word “fart” could make you and your friends laugh. But as we got older toilet humor got less funny. There are, of course, exceptions to that rule. And when it comes to toilet humor there might be no better moment than Jeff Daniels and an actual toilet in “Dumb and Dumber.” It’s loud and gross and the epitome of lowbrow comedy. Daniels gives it all he’s got and the physical comedy that accompanies those sounds, well – the kid in all of us busts a gut every time.\n\n#26: Mike Tyson's Punch Out\n\n“The Hangover” (2009)\n\nEverything about this scene is so absurd, it’s impossible not to laugh out loud. Watching “Iron” Mike Tyson get down to some Phil Collins is great stuff – and then there’s the out-of-nowhere shock and awe of the punch. The way Zach Galifianakis plants face first on the floor is truly hilarious. Obviously when you rewatch the scene, you know what is about to happen to poor, sweet Alan. But while the shock factor of the knockout might have diminished over time, the comedy awesomeness of the scene as a whole sure hasn’t.\n\n#25: “Twist and Shout”\n\n“Ferris Bueller's Day Off” (1986)\n\nWhat kid growing up in the 80s didn’t want to be Ferris Bueller? He had a loving family, he was one of the most popular kids in school, and he could get away with anything. That includes skipping school and “borrowing” his friend's dad’s 1961 Ferrari 250 GT California Spyder. And who can forget Ferris jumping on a float during the Von Steuben Day Parade and lip-syncing to “Twist and Shout.” As his friend Cameron says about him, “Ferris can do anything.” And we love watching him do it over and over again.\n\n#24: Mrs. Cleary’s Advances\n\n“Wedding Crashers” (2005)\n\nEven if some of the movie's jokes fall flat or have aged poorly, Owen Wilson and Vince Vaughn's brotastic chemistry elevates \"Wedding Crashers\" above many similar raunchy comedies. In less capable hands, Jeremy drilling John about what exactly happened when his love interest’s mother came onto him could have been unintentionally cringy. If Vaughn showed even the tiniest hint of embarrassment, this scene would have fallen straight on its face; however, the actor delivers the motorboat line with such confidence and dedication, any potential cringe factor gives way to hearty laughs.\n\n#23: Brennan & Dale’s Fight\n\n“Step Brothers” (2008)\n\nJohn C. Reilly and Will Ferrell have proven more than once that they are a match made in heaven, and few scenes represent the pair's manchild brilliance as absolutely as the sibling fight from “Step Brothers.” What starts as an argument about taking responsibility and arrested development, quickly devolves into blunt force trauma, straight-up attempted murder, and a burial. Up until this point, Brennan and Dale had not exactly hidden their contempt for each other, so the fight served as the ultimate pay-off for a hilarious sibling rivalry between two of the film industry's greatest childish adults.\n\n#22: Shaun Is Oblivious of the Zombie Apocalypse\n\n“Shaun of the Dead” (2004)\n\nEven in 2004, zombie movies had already been done to death. So, \"Shaun of the Dead\" needed to start things off with a bang. As Shaun stumbles down to the local shop while failing to realize that the neighborhood has collectively acquired a taste for brains, Edgar Wright's movie instantly sets itself apart from the competition. Hilarious as it may be to watch Shaun change the channel on the apocalypse, this sequence also pushes to the forefront the film's social commentary, a staple of the zombie genre since the days of \"Night of the Living Dead.\"\n\n#21: Buddy Meeting Santa\n\n“Elf” (2003)\n\nWill Ferrell has a knack for infusing his characters with a sincere innocence that warms the heart, and \"Elf's\" Buddy exemplifies that. In a scene that embodies Buddy's childlike enthusiasm to perfection, the Ferrell-sized elf reacts with “a hint” of excitement to Santa's impending arrival. Even if Santa does not quite manage to live up to the hype, Buddy's infectious energy is just one of those things that can put a smile on anyone's face. Whether it is Christmas or a warm July morning, Buddy's “Santa” scream is medicine for the soul all year round.\n\n#20: Trashing a Printer\n\n“Office Space” (1999)\n\nSimultaneously hilarious and an accurate take on life in a cubicle, \"Office Space\" oozes frustration out of every fiber of its being. Whether it is Peter getting grilled about a company-wide memo or Samir dealing with broken office equipment, the employees at Initech are on the brink of a complete meltdown, a feeling that is definitely relatable. So, when the recently fired Samir and Michael destroy a broken printer with Peter, the scene is not only cathartic for the characters but for everyone who has ever worked in an office. The soundtrack is just the icing on the cake.\n\n#19: Watching “Spaceballs”\n\n“Spaceballs” (1987)\n\nYou know in movies when the bad guys are trying to locate the good guys so that they can attack them? Well, imagine if they could actually just watch the movie they’re in while they’re in it and find them that way. This brilliant bit of fourth-wall-breaking sneakery seems so obvious now, but no one had ever thought of it until 1987 when Mel Brooks made the “Star Wars” parody “Spaceballs.” Sure, there’ll be some younger folks who find the scene fascinating just for its use of VHS tapes – something many have probably never seen in real life. But it’s Rick Moranis’ bewildered reactions that make it so rewatchable for every generation.\n\n#18: Frank & Beans\n\n“There's Something About Mary” (1998)\n\nThere’s “painfully awkward” and then there’s “painful and awkward,” and this memorable scene from “There's Something About Mary” leans right into the latter. First there’s the pain when Ted innocently catches a glimpse of Mary changing and, embarrassed, zips up his pants too quickly, catching a bit of his… um… manhood in the process. Then there’s the awkward, as first Mary’s stepfather, then her mother, then a cop and a fireman all enter the bathroom and take a look at what he’s done. We feel bad for Ted everytime we watch it – but we also laugh every time as well.\n\n#17: Fogell as McLovin\n\n“Superbad” (2007)\n\nCompressing the awkwardness of high school into a two-hour experience, \"Superbad\" is packed to the brim with memorable scenes. Not to take anything away from Seth and Evan, who are great main characters, but \"Superbad's\" ultimate scene-stealer is the one and only, McLovin. While far from the smooth-talking “25-year-old”'s only awesome moment, McLovin's introduction is the stuff that legends are made of. Like all of the best jokes, this routine has a ton of swearing, manages to reference Seal, and has just enough logic to make the absurdity of the situation stand out.\n\n#16: Bluto's Speech\n\n“Animal House” (1978)\n\nIt may not be the most factually accurate. And it’s not particularly inspiring, at least at first. But once it warms up and gets going, Bluto’s speech is simple, direct, wonderfully vulgar, loud and – with a little help from Otter – very inspirational. This becomes clear when everyone runs out of the room cheering at the end, ready to seek their revenge on those who they believe have wronged them. It’s one of the most iconic moments in the history of comedy movies, and easily one of the most rewatched as well.\n\n#15: A Giant Johnson\n\n“Austin Powers: The Spy Who Shagged Me” (1999)\n\nConsidering all the stiff competition, it takes something truly special to tell a great joke about the male anatomy. In an inspired sequence that elevates a visual gag that could easily have targeted low-hanging fruit, Austin Powers proves that the sky's the limit when someone has a thesaurus and the willingness to go where only the best \"Saturday Night Live\" alumni dare to go. Splendidly edited, brilliantly paced, and climaxing at just the right time, \"Austin Powers'\" Johnson sequence deserves a standing ovation for setting a new standard for jokes about the male member in cinema.\n\n#14: Negotiating with Flaming Dragon\n\n“Tropic Thunder” (2008)\n\nLes Grossman does not negotiate with terrorists, something Tugg Speedman learns the hard way. Very much playing against type, Tom Cruise's balding and profane studio executive steals the show in every one of his scenes in \"Tropic Thunder,\" none more so than during Les' verbal slaughter of the Flaming Dragon gang. As Les delivers a beautifully profanity-laden and bizarrely inspirational speech prophesying a scorched earth future, Matthew McConaughey's agent can only look on with bewilderment and panic, feelings shared with the Flaming Dragon who might have just found their match.\n\n#13: The Price Is Wrong\n\n“Happy Gilmore” (1996)\n\nSome jokes work better on paper than in execution, but there is no universe where a fight between Adam Sandler and Bob Barker on a golf course could be anything other than comedy gold. \"Happy Gilmore\" represents Sandler at his angriest best, but the Bob Barker fight scene works on an even more primal level that does not require context. Reflecting Sandler's \"SNL\" roots, this scene could easily be envisioned as a stand-alone sketch, as each moment builds upon the previous before reaching a predictable but still hilarious punchline.\n\n#12: “Canned Heat”\n\n“Napoleon Dynamite” (2004)\n\nOn its own, \"Napoleon Dynamite's\" \"Canned Heat\" dance scene works as a quirky and well-choreographed skit that is mildly amusing. In the context of the story, it serves as a selfless act by a socially isolated character who is not always the most likable. Especially when the film was originally released, \"Napoleon Dynamite\" stood out by centering on a nerdy misfit who was kind of bizarre and knowingly awkward, which is the type of character typically restricted to secondary roles or throwaway gags. Napoleon is a unique character and this dance reflects that flawlessly.\n\n#11: “Hellooo!”\n\n“Mrs. Doubtfire” (1993)\n\nRobin Williams' innate comedic talent shined through in pretty much everything the actor did, and \"Mrs. Doubtfire\" was no exception. Even many years after its release, \"Mrs. Doubtfire\" manages to generate laughs out of even the most mundane of situations, including making tea and indulging in a bit of cake. Williams flip-flopping between his Daniel and Mrs. Doubtfire personas while trying to keep Mrs. Sellner in the dark is a treat to behold, culminating in a punchline that is just the right type of silly. Even after all these years, a cake to the face is still funny.\n\n#10: “You’re Entering a World of Pain”\n\n“The Big Lebowski” (1998)\n\nWhether it is Jesus' dance or The Dude's dream sequences, \"The Big Lebowski\" is not exactly lacking in unforgettable scenes. While the whole movie is endlessly rewatchable, Walter's passionate speech about the importance of following the rules is something else. In just a few minutes, a harmless conversation about a “pomeranian” dog escalates to a near-hostage situation as Walter uses the barrel end of a gun to convince Smokey that his toe did, in fact, slip over the line. Along with some fantastic dialogue, this scene has a certain intensity that only John Goodman can bring.\n\n#9: Stonehenge\n\n“This Is Spinal Tap” (1984)\n\nNow here is a scene that knows how to raise the laughs to 11. \"This is Spinal Tap\" is the mockumentary to end all mockumentaries, a hilarious ode to rock music that treads the fine line between stupid and clever. In a film filled with great moments, the Stonehenge performance steals the show just for its sheer majesty and hugeness. While everything that happens at the concert is just fantastic, the fallout of the pint-sized Stonehenge debacle might be even funnier, with David St. Hubbins finding the perfect words to compliment such an epic visual gag.\n\n#8: Abby Normal\n\n“Young Frankenstein” (1974)\n\nPicking a standout scene in “Young Frankenstein,” let alone Mel Brooks' entire filmography, is a daunting task. As impossible as it is to get tired of the \"Puttin' On the Ritz\" musical number, that show-stopping performance takes a backseat to a smaller moment that simply lets Gene Wilder and Marty Feldman do their thing. Even removed from the film's context, the Abby Normal exchange still manages to land thanks to the cast's performances, the direction, and the immaculate dialogue. It is comedy at its finest, something that could be said for the entirety of \"Young Frankenstein.\"\n\n#7: The Mirror Scene\n\n“Duck Soup” (1933)\n\nEven with the endless cartoon parodies in existence, nothing comes close to the 1933 version. The Marx Brothers created a true timeless classic with \"Duck Soup,\" and the mirror scene is fully deserving of its iconic status. As a disguised Pinky tries to imitate Firefly's movements, the charade grows increasingly more absurd as Groucho and Harpo Marx demonstrate their full mastery over the art of slapstick. Even if the Marx Brothers cannot take credit for conceiving this type of routine, \"Duck Soup's\" mirror gag is comedy perfection and will continue to be referenced for decades to come.\n\n#6: An Explosive Dress Fitting\n\n“Bridesmaids” (2011)\n\nFor better or worse, toilet humor has been a pillar of comedy movies for seemingly forever. Built on the foundation laid out by all the poop jokes that came before it, \"Bridesmaids\" took the concept as far as it could go while giving the cold shoulder to good taste in the best possible way. Contrary to toilet humor's reputation for being lazy, the food poisoning sequence is a masterfully paced routine that gradually escalates from one extreme to the next, as it goes to places that leave even the characters themselves in disbelief.\n\n#5: “Bohemian Rhapsody”\n\n“Wayne's World” (1992)\n\nQueen released ​​“Bohemian Rhapsody” in October 1975, and in 1976 the song peaked at number nine on the US charts. Then, in 1992, it landed on the charts again and rose to number two. So, what happened to put the song on people’s minds again? “Wayne’s World” happened, along with that classic scene of Wayne, Garth, and the guys cruising in the Mirthmobile through Aurora, Illinois while singing along. The movie helped to re-popularize the song, and the song is part of what makes the movie such a classic. For many of us the two shall always be linked.\n\n#4: Chest Waxing\n\n“The 40-Year-Old Virgin” (2005)\n\nLike most Judd Apatow flicks, \"The 40-Year-Old Virgin\" has an air of authenticity that helps sell its more sentimental beats. Andy's chest waxing might very well be the most realistic movie makeover ever; in fact, Steve Carell genuinely got his chest hair ripped off in the name of entertainment. Compared to the rest of the movie, this scene was shot in a more minimalistic manner so nothing distracts from Carell's genuine reactions to being waxed. Comedy is intrinsically linked to pain, and \"The 40-Year-Old Virgin\" refined that concept to its most primal form.\n\n#3: Katz’s Delicatessen\n\n“When Harry Met Sally...” (1989)\n\nWhether it leaves someone laughing or recontextualizing previous escapades, \"When Harry Met Sally's\" deli scene will not be forgotten anytime soon. Thanks to what is a truly convincing performance, Sally leaves the self-assured Harry completely speechless, although another patron does chime in with the perfect line. Along with inspiring a flash mob recreation in 2013, the deli scene serves as perhaps the greatest showcase of Meg Ryan's comedic and acting talents. Along with just standing quite well on its own, this moment is comfortably the most hilarious scene in a consistently funny movie.\n\n#2: The Black Knight Duel\n\n“Monty Python and the Holy Grail” (1975)\n\nIn a world populated by killer rabbits and rude French soldiers, anything can happen. While on a divine quest to retrieve the Holy Grail, King Arthur's travels lead him to cross paths with a particularly stubborn Black Knight. The ensuing duel is nothing short of legendary, as the King of the Britons bravely faces and even manages to disarm the mighty Black Knight. Even with a central plot adding an element of cohesiveness to proceedings, \"The Holy Grail\" is still a byproduct of \"Monty Python's” sketch comedy roots. And like the best sketches from \"Monty Python's Flying Circus,\" the Black Knight routine never grows old.\n\n#1: The Newscaster Fight\n\n“Anchorman: The Legend of Ron Burgundy” (2004)\n\nEndlessly quotable and forever immortalized through memes, \"Anchorman\" and its newscaster brawl scene have more than cemented their places in comedy history. Taking a break from satirizing the '70s broadcasting culture to stage a pseudo-Western standoff featuring some of the early 2000s’ most recognizable comedians, \"Anchorman\" absolutely revels in its overconfident stupidity and cartoonish humor. While the sequel does an admirable job of trying to recreate the magic by throwing in a multitude of new faces and a minotaur, it is very much just retreading the same ground as the original \"Anchorman.\""
