        "text": "Don't be fooled by the title. \"Superbad\" is in no way a literal description of this movie's quality. Funny from beginning to end and well written, \"Superbad\" is well worth the ticket price.\n\nSeth (Jonah Hill) and Evan (Michael Cera) are the best of friends and high school seniors. Their final days before graduation and college are upon them and they want to make the best of the time they have.\n\nFate deals them quite a hand as they find themselves chased by incompetent cops and trapped at a stranger's house forced to sing for cokeheads — all in the name of getting booze as entry fee for the last, big party of the year where the girls of their dreams will be in attendance. Along the way they uncover what their friendship really means to them and just how much one is willing to go through for the other.\n\nWriters Seth Rogan and Evan Goldberg have both worked under writer/director/producer Judd Apatow, who got his start writing for Ben Stiller and Tom Arnold then moved on to his own work, \"Freaks and Geeks\" and \"Undeclared.\" He most recently wrote and directed \"Knocked Up\" in which Rogan starred and Goldberg co-produced.\n\nOver their years together, these two have developed a biting, adult, dialogue-driven comedic style that can be placed in the dullest of situations and make it entertaining. The good old high school coming-of-age story has been done countless times, but Rogan and Goldberg make it worth seeing again in \"Superbad.\"\n\nYou've got to wonder, besides giving the two main characters their own names, how much of the real Rogan and Goldberg are in \"Superbad.\" Did they really have a childhood friendship?\n\nWhich one was accepted in a prestigious college leaving the other with a feeling of abandonment? Was it Seth or Evan who respectfully turned down the unmistakable advances of his high school crush due to the state of her intoxication while the other, in the process of passing out from his own drunken state, head butted the girl of his dreams giving her a black eye? Which one was McLovin?\n\nDirector Greg Mottola, who also worked with this crew on \"Undeclared\" and who cut his teeth as a director of film on \"Superbad,\" has a knack for letting the characters tell the story and making it easy for the viewer to forget there's a camera there at all. We think we're just listening in on these characters' ridiculous conversations.\n\nThere were moments when the humor seemed forced, when it was clear a conversation was designed to do nothing but reach a punchline. I know — it's a comedy, that's what they do. But in these moments it almost felt as though the actors needed to lose the quality of their character in order to deliver the line. Whether this was due to actor, director or writer is hard to tell.\n\nIt is clear that poor Michael Cera (Evan) will continue to be typecast as the awkward, nervous teenager. His performance was, for the most part, a reprisal of George-Michael Bluth, his character in \"Arrested Development,\" but he was perfectly cast and did a great job as Evan.\n\nI also wished there had been a more consistent level of believability throughout the story. Though much of what went on in the first act of the movie was hilarious, it was quite possible. Once the characters of Officer Slater and Officer Michaels were introduced I had to turn up my suspension of disbelief by several notches.\n\nIf you had been near me in the theater, though, you wouldn't have guessed I had such criticisms. \"Superbad\" is a great addition to the catalogue of humor by these talented writers/directors/actors. I can't wait to see what's next."
