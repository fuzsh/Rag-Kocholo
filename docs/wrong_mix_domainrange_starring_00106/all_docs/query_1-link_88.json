        "text": "This Cutie and John Legend\n\nWhile we’re sure his late-night cries aren’t as pleasant as John Legend’s soothing voice, this little baby looks just like the baby-faced crooner. This baby’s aunt shared his photo on Twitter with the caption that read, “My nephew looks like John Legend, lol,” and it seems like the internet agrees!\n\nWith more than 26,000 retweets and over 33,000 likes, it’s not just her that sees a resemblance. We wonder if this little baby is as talented as his doppelgänger; if so, he has some pretty big shoes to fill! We can't wait to see what he looks like when he grows up.\n\nBabies of an Unusual Size\n\nWallace Shawn may have starred in many films, but one of his most famous (and most beloved) film roles was as the hapless Vizzini in “The Princess Bride.” He played the Sicilian criminal, bully, and mastermind employed by Prince Humperdinck to kidnap Buttercup. Now, he is known for his bald head and signature voice.\n\nHe is still considered one of the most beloved character actors. This little baby looks so much like the actor; it’s almost …inconceivable! This baby looks like it’s about to take off on a mission to save the princess and battle some Rodents of Unusual Size. That is after he takes his nap!\n\nWe Hope This Baby Isn’t “Superbad”\n\nIf we’re being honest, actor Michael Cera is one of those actors who can somehow realistically play a teenager even well into their 30s. That is because Michael has a permanently youthful look that allows him to play everything from a nerdy high schooler in \"Superbad\" to a teenager in the comedy “Arrested Development.”\n\nIt seems that this baby has everything from Michael’s disheveled curly hair down to his awkward facial expressions down pat! The more we look at this picture, the more we can’t tell this baby apart from the actor! Maybe this little one will also forge a career path, just like Cera, playing just as painfully awkward characters.\n\nThis Baby Is a Clone of Vin Diesel\n\nWith their clean-shaved heads and seemingly perpetually annoyed look, is it any surprise that many parents think their babies look like the actor Vin Diesel? That said, this baby looks very serious and almost like he’s about to put the pedal to the metal in his toy car with this face!\n\nHe better be prepared, all that’s missing is a white tank top and some tattoos and this baby can try out for the next installment of the “Fast & Furious” film franchise! If this baby ever decides to go into show business, he may do well playing a hulky, younger Vin!\n\nPopeye the Sailor Baby\n\nOh my, how adorable is this baby sticking out her lip like that? For decades, the animated character Popeye the Sailor Man has been enchanting generations of children with his silly but hilarious antics. It turns out that the famous sailor’s legacy lives on in this adorable little baby.\n\nWith their furled eyebrows and funny upturned mouth, this baby looks like she’s one can of spinach away from growing muscles that would make Popeye proud. All that she’s missing is a pipe and a sailor hat! We wonder if there’s another baby out there who looks like Olive Oyl.\n\nThis Baby “Don’t Get No Respect!”\n\nKnown for his hilarious roles in films like “Caddyshack” and his signature self-deprecating one-liners, the late Rodney Dangerfield was one of the most influential men in comedy. His signature line was always, \"I don't get no respect,\" and it was this line that set him on a career path to becoming a legendary comedian.\n\nWith his funny facial expressions and his bulging blue eyes, while hilarious, Rodney wasn’t exactly known for his looks. Looking at this picture, it seems like this baby has been practicing how to make Rodney’s exaggerated facial expressions in the mirror. We wonder if his first words will be a funny one-liner.\n\n“Hellllloooo Dear!”\n\nWhen it comes to picking a favorite film from the ‘90s, most people would agree that “Mrs. Doubtfire” is the type of film we could watch over and over again. Of course, no discussion of the comedy classic would be complete without the hilarious performance by the late comedic actor Robin Williams as the convincing nanny.\n\nIt turns out that Robin’s thick-framed glasses and blonde wig have inspired a new generation… like this baby who looks like a miniature version of the famous nanny. Maybe she's auditioning for a new role as little Ms. Doubtfire? We have a feeling that this baby would enjoy that pie scene!\n\n“Blue Steel” Baby\n\nWhen it comes to striking a ridiculous pose, nobody does it better than the character Derek Zoolander from the 2001 deliberately dumb comedy “Zoolander.” Played by Ben Stiller, the vapid supermodel character was known for his ridiculous and over-the-top facial expressions — a look perfectly copied by this little baby!\n\nWe don’t know how, but this baby has been able to perfectly mimic Ben’s famous pouty and cheek-clenching look. This baby seems to be reinventing the \"Blue Steel\" look that was first done by dimwitted male model Derek Zoolander. Perhaps he could play a baby supermodel-turned-hero in the next Zoolander sequel!\n\n“Feed Me, Seymour”\n\nRick Moranis is one of the most well-known stars of the ‘80s and early ‘90s. A natural comedian, Rick often brought a funny element to his characters. Bespectacled and unassuming in appearance, Moranis' perpetually confused facial expressions gave him a career playing the silly and goofy character in many Hollywood films.\n\nThis baby seems to have also been given that naturally confused look, so much so that many people seem to think that he looks exactly like the “Ghostbusters” star! Only without the glasses, of course. The more we look at this baby, the more we can see the uncanny resemblance!\n\nChef-Approved Baby Formula\n\nWhen it comes to throwing massive tantrums, celebrity chef Gordon Ramsey definitely takes the perfectly prepared cake. Between shouting and throwing things, Gordon’s fiery behavior can sometimes resemble that of a moody baby throwing his toys out of the cot. Unsurprisingly, some babies resemble the “Kitchen Nightmares” star, like this one!\n\nThis baby seems to have perfected Gordon’s disappointed look - perhaps he’s upset that his parents overheated the milk, or maybe his smashed pumpkin isn’t to his liking. Either way, just like the real Gordon, we wouldn’t want to get on his bad side and have to face his raging temper!\n\nA Bit Weird, “Innit”\n\nLike many comedians, Ricky Gervais frequently brings on other guests to his shows or specials. One of his favorite people to speak to is his embarrassingly ignorant (yet somehow proud of it) friend and contributor to the show, Karl Pilkington. He is probably best known as the star of the travel documentary series \"An Idiot Abroad.\"\n\nKarl also starred in a show called \"Derek\" but was too nervous to have a major role in season 2, so he was written out. Though we don't think this baby has Karl’s famous accent, we think he has the comedic star’s round and bald head. Considering the ridiculous thing Karl has said on the show, we have a feeling this baby probably has a bit more common sense!\n\nThis Baby Makes for a Very “Modern Family”\n\nConsidered one of the funniest television series in recent years, the secret behind the success of “Modern Family'' was the show’s incredible ensemble cast, each putting a funny spin on their characters. One of the show’s favorite characters was Cam, played by Eric Stonestreet, with his sharp wit and impeccable comedic timing.\n\nWith his slick, gelled-back hair, hilarious mannerisms, chubby cheeks, and outrageous taste in clothes, this little baby looks like he’s been taking notes after watching all of these reruns of the beloved sitcom. He looks perfect for the part; we just think he’s missing a nerdy best friend who looks like Mitchell!\n\n“Yeah” to Nap Time!\n\nThere are some babies that look so much like celebrities that you can’t help but stop and do a double-take. At least that’s what happens to this mom, who apparently constantly gets stopped at the grocery stores by people who think her baby looks a lot like R&B legend Usher.\n\nWith his big round brown eyes, sneaky smile, and adorable button nose, this baby looks a lot like a talented artist who went on to sell multiple gold, platinum, and diamond records. While he still has a few years before he can perfect his dance moves, we think Usher should watch his back!\n\nBroadway Bound Baby\n\nFrom “The Birdcage” to “The Lion King,” even if you don’t know Nathan Lane’s name, you can most certainly recognize his face or his voice. The award-winning actor has left his hilarious mark on the world of film in comedies and dramas, as well as in musicals on Broadway.\n\nWhile we’re not sure that this baby has his doppelgänger’s acting and singing chops, he definitely resembles the talented star. We just keep waiting to hear Timon’s voice come out of that little face, or maybe he'll burst into song like Nathan Lane did when he appeared in Sesame Street.\n\nHilariously Adorable Baby\n\nBefore his untimely passing in 1997, Chris Farley was one of the biggest stars in comedy and in Hollywood. Comically gifted, Farley first made a name for himself in the early 1990s as a clown on \"Saturday Night Live\" before making a name for himself in comedic films. Chris was known for creating unforgettable and larger-than-life characters.\n\nWhile there are many comedic stars, very few of them can rival Chris's funny performances. While this baby may be a bit young to know who the classic comedian was, they certainly have a strong resemblance to the late star — down to Chris’ exaggerated facial expressions and round face!\n\nAll the King's Horses …\n\nWhen it comes to being compared to a famous figure or celebrity, some comparisons are more flattering than others. This next comparison is a perfect example. Apparently, a few people have mentioned that this person’s baby looks a lot like a famous character from a children’s nursery rhyme — the Eggcellent character of Humpty Dumpty.\n\nLooking at his pleasantly plump round face and yellow-patterned bowtie, we can kind of see the resemblance between him and the famous egg who sat on the wall. Unfortunately, Humpty Dumpty had a great fall, so we hope for this baby's sake that no one leaves him anywhere near a wall!\n\nThis Little Cutie Is Just “Perfect”!\n\nEd Sheeran is easily one of the most beloved singer-songwriters of our generation. He first started writing songs when he was 11, and with so much experience and his charming voice, it’s no surprise that he’s behind some of the most beautiful lyrics and popular love songs of our time.\n\nThough he may have a beautiful voice, his appearance has often been the subject of many jokes, particularly his flaming red hair. This little baby may not have Ed’s killer songwriting capabilities, but she does have his fiery red hair and pale skin! Who knows, maybe his appearance could land him a job as an impersonator.\n\nHeartthrob-in-Training\n\nWith his good looks and incomparable level of coolness, James Dean was a true Hollywood legend who, sadly, was gone too soon. While his legacy lives on in everything from fashion campaigns to reruns of his films, it seems the screen icon lives on in the form of this little boy.\n\nTo look like one of the most iconic figures in American cinematic history is one of the best compliments one could ever receive. From the slicked-back hair to the brooding glance, this toddler is a Hollywood heartthrob in training! We have a feeling that he’s going to be quite the heartbreaker when he grows up!\n\nHe’s Got 99 Problems, But a Bottle ‘Aint One!\n\nConsidered one of the world’s greatest rappers and a formidable businessman, Jay Z is one of the most powerful figures in the entertainment industry. While the lyrics of his songs aren’t generally considered the most “family-friendly,” the rapper actually has a soft side — he’s a doting husband and father.\n\nLooking at this photo, we think this baby could easily fit into Jay’s family, considering that he looks like an exact clone of the popular rapper! From the serious gaze to the shape of his eyes. This baby looks like they're about to drop the hottest rap album of the summer!\n\nA Famous Redhead\n\nWhen it comes to being the king of late-night television, most people would agree that Conan O’Brien is definitely a fan favorite we love to see on-screen. In addition to his witty, self-effacing comedic style, hilarious jokes, and interview skills, Conan is also known for his signature coiffed bright red hair.\n\nEven before landing his high-profile gig as a talk show host, this tall, gangly, carrot-topped comic was already revered and well-known for his incredible talent. The subject of many of his jokes, Conan's hair, is almost as famous as he is. So famous, in fact, that some people can even spot the resemblance between their children and the late-night comedian!\n\nThis Baby Likes to “Party on”\n\nThe early ‘90s brought us some of the funniest characters in television and in film, so funny that even decades later, we’re all still quoting them. One character that seems to always be a Halloween favorite is Garth Algar from the oddball comedy that revels in its silliness, \"Wayne's World\" is still fondly regarded because of its endearing characters.\n\nGarth, played by the hilarious Dana Carvey, is the co-host in his friend Wayne’s show about heavy metal and “babes.” While Dana Carvey will always be Garth to us, this little boy is giving him competition. With his similar blonde hair and signature thick-framed glasses, “we’re not worthy” of such a cutie!\n\nDanny Petite-o!\n\nFrom television roles like “It’s Always Sunny in Philadelphia” to movies like “Matilda,” Danny DeVito is one of the most beloved actors in Hollywood. Part of what makes him so amazing in his comedic roles is that he’s not afraid to embrace his silly side and look completely ridiculous — a bit like this baby!\n\nThis parent saw their son’s big smile and hair were similar to the “Twins” actor and immediately knew who he looked like. We’re sure baby DeVito must have looked exactly like this child when he was that age! Either way, they're both still adorably cute and entertaining to look at.\n\n“You Shall Not Nap … Pass”\n\nSome babies look so much like famous figures that the more you look at them, the more you begin to see the resemblance. This little baby proves our point — the more we look at him, the more we see Gandalf, the wizard from “The Lord of the Rings” and “The Hobbit'' films.\n\nWith his adorably grizzled face and expressive eyes, all he’s missing is a long beard, tussled hair, a worn-out wizard cloak, and staff, and he could be a new citizen of Middle Earth! We wonder if Ian McKellan knows there’s a baby who looks just like him who could easily play his role.\n\nThe Prince and the Pacifier\n\nSome people are lucky enough to be born into royalty, but for many of us, the throne will always be a faraway dream. While he may never become an official member of the British Royal Family, we think this little boy may, however, have a shot at becoming just as famous.\n\nThe reason? He looks exactly like the young Prince George of Wales, the eldest child of William, Prince of Wales, and Catherine, Princess of Wales. This person spotted the uncanny resemblance their godson had to the royal child and held up a copy of George’s picture just to be sure!\n\nIt’s MAD-Dening How Much They Look Alike!\n\nFor decades, Mad Magazine has featured a character named Alfred E. Neuman on most of their covers — a young boy with freckles and a gap-toothed smile. But while many celebrities such as Rick Astley and David Letterman have been compared to the mischievous-looking boy, we think this baby is the closest in terms of looks!\n\nHe even has reddish hair and a similarly-shaped face and ears! All he has to do is grow up a bit in the sun till he gets a few freckles. We’re sure when he’s old enough to pick up an issue of the satirical magazine, he’ll see the resemblance, too!\n\nThe (Tiny) Situation\n\nFrom Snooky to Vinny, everyone had a favorite member of MTV’s hit reality show \"Jersey Shore.\" During the early 2000s, you couldn’t escape the crazy antics of the reality show. Though the show’s cast has moved on past their fake tan and nightclub phase, it seems that this little boy is hoping to bring back the spirit of the show.\n\nWith his open shirt, chain, and spunky attitude, he almost looks like the spitting image of Michael ”The Situation” Sorrentino! We wonder if he’s ready to GTL (gym, tan, laundry) when nap time is over or if he eventually decides to venture out and star in a reality TV show before hosting his own podcast.\n\nA-Rod’s Twin\n\nKnown for dating some of the biggest celebrities in Hollywood and for his impressive baseball career, Alex “A-Rod” Rodriguez quickly became one of Major League Baseball’s most famous players on and off the field. He's moved on to other things now, like working as an MLB analyst for Fox Sports.\n\nThough he is now retired, the former baseball player has found success as a media personality and for his (now over) relationship with Jennifer Lopez. Looking at this picture of this little boy, we think he looks exactly like a miniature version of the sports star, especially with those beautiful eyes!\n\nAn Understated Cutie\n\nThough she generally shies away from paparazzi or the celebrity gossip mill, actress Michelle Williams is one of the most celebrated stars today. The low-key actress initially starred in the angst-fueled teen series \"Dawson's Creek,\" but now she is known for her warm eyes and smile, and light-colored locks.\n\nIt's not hard to see that this little girl looks a lot like Michelle, with similar features, especially that demure and adorable smile and those hazel eyes! If there were ever a film about Michelle’s life, this little girl could definitely be cast to play a younger version of the “Dawson’s Creek” star!\n\nStraight Out of a Holiday Classic\n\nEvery year, many families gather together to watch the classic holiday film “A Christmas Story”. Both warmly nostalgic and darkly humorous, \"A Christmas Story\" is based on the humorous writings of author Jean Shepherd and tells the tale of a young boy named Ralphie and has since become a popular holiday tradition.\n\nIt seems that the family of this boy gets a reminder of the film every day of the year when they look at their son. With his blonde hair and thick-framed glasses, he looks exactly like the naughty character named Ralphie Parker! We just hope he doesn’t find himself in the same silly situations as the character in the film!\n\nMini Marky Mark\n\nFrom his rough beginnings as a rapper to becoming one of the most in-demand stars in Hollywood, Mark Wahlberg went from a jailed Boston street thug to a respected, legitimate actor in less than a decade, and he has defied the critics and naysayers to create an extremely successful career for himself.\n\nThough his days of prancing around the stage shirtless are behind him, Mark has become known as a serious actor — a sentiment this equally serious little boy shares with the star. This parent shared a picture of their son next to the “Ted” star and we can’t believe how much the two look alike!\n\nSo Similar, It’s Eyebrow Raising!\n\nBefore he was a major star in the movie industry, Dwayne Johnson was known as The Rock — a professional wrestler known for his questionable leather outfits and his very impressive eyebrow-raising skills! But wrestling was just the beginning. Johnson made his acting debut on an episode of \"That '70s Show,\" and the rest is history.\n\nThis little baby seems like they’ve been watching a bit too many reruns of The Rock’s appearances on the wrestling channel because they seem to be trying their best to copy his signature eyebrow moves. We think this little doppelgänger is simply adorable and looks a lot like the “Moana” star!\n\n500 Days of Nap Time\n\nJoseph Gordon Levitt is one of the hardest working actors in Hollywood — from big-budget films to indies; Joseph has proven just how versatile he is as an actor. In addition to being well-respected for his craft, Joseph is known as being an unexpected heartthrob thanks to his boyish good looks and charisma.\n\nWhile this little boy has quite a few years before he reaches heartthrob status, he definitely has Joseph’s charming smile and charisma! Just look at those expressive eyebrows and his smug smile that seems to be hiding a secret. We imagine that Joseph must have looked a lot like him at that age!\n\nThis Cutie Looks Like He Was Born to Cook\n\nWhen it comes to celebrity chefs, few are as beloved as Jamie Oliver. As one of the world's most celebrated health food advocates, this British chef’s casual approach to cuisine, very hands-on cooking style, and down-to-earth personality quickly made him a fan favorite. Let's not forget his adorably good looks!\n\nThough some years have passed since his television debut with “The Naked Chef”, Jamie is still on-screen and as always, he has his boyish charm and floppy hair. It’s no surprise, then, that this baby's parents thought that their little baby looked a lot like the famous chef, cookbook author, and restaurateur!\n\nBaby by Day, Zombie Hunter by Night\n\nAlready well-known in his native U.K., actor Simon Pegg gained fame in Hollywood with his role in the zombie comedy “Shaun of the Dead” and the dark comedy “Hot Fuzz.” Known for his roles in sci-fi and supernatural films and television shows, the actor, writer, and self-proclaimed nerd is a fan favorite.\n\nThis little baby probably shouldn’t see most of Simon’s films yet, especially not \"Shaun of the Dead\" and \"Hot Fuzz,\" both of which received a cult following. But we have to admit that he looks a lot like the “Paul” star! He even has Simon’s expressive eyes and red hair!\n\nThis Baby Looks Like He Would Be Comfortable at “The Office”\n\nThe American remake of “The Office” has become one of the most beloved sitcoms in recent years, which somehow gets funnier every time you watch it. It features the Dunder-Mifflin staff, which could possibly pass for people with whom you work in your office. But with so many memorable characters and episodes, it’s hard to pick favorites.\n\nThat said, we’re sure this baby’s parents love the character of Kevin, considering their baby looks almost exactly like the hilariously awkward schlep we can't forget, Kevin Malone. This memorable character was played by Brian Baumgartner, who did well to bring this role to life and see it through his character arc. We just hope this baby has a better personality!\n\nThe Cutest Troll in the World!\n\nIf you’re of a certain age, then you can probably remember begging your parents to buy you a troll doll. Unlike the internet trolls of today, these troll dolls were so ugly they were actually cute. These plastic dolls had furry up-combed hair and were meant to depict trolls from old Scandinavian folklore.\n\nThis little boy seems to look eerily similar to the once-popular toys with his spiky hair and big eyes — all he’s missing is the little jewel in the middle of his belly! One commenter on this Reddit post suggested that this baby and his siblings can start their own troll army!\n\nBlueberries for Baby\n\nThere are times when things fall together in such a perfect way it’s almost unbelievable. This little girl was enjoying the classic children’s book by Robert McCloskey, “Blueberries for Sal,” when her parents, who also happen to be Reddit users, noticed the uncanny resemblance she had to the book’s main character.\n\nFrom her blonde hair to her big blue eyes, she almost looks like a pixie. Had the book not been written in 1948, we would have thought she was the inspiration behind the famous story. We’re sure the similarities between her and the main character are just as surprising to this little girl!\n\nCabbage Patch Baby\n\nThere was a time when Cabbage Patch dolls were one of the most popular toys for children. Everyone loved Cabbage Patch Dolls back in the day because no doll was the same as the other. These wide-eyed and adorable round-faced dolls found their way into the hearts of both kids and adults.\n\nThis parent was going through their old toy box when they came across a Cabbage Patch kid doll that looked exactly like their son down to the same outfit! Maybe his old Cabbage Patch doll was a sign of things to come? We don’t know if this coincidence is cute or creepy, to be honest!\n\nHilariously Adorable\n\nPatton Oswalt is known for his hilarious stand-up specials where he discusses politics and pop culture and his roles on shows like “The King of Queens”, “The Goldbergs” and the fan-favorite Pixar animated film \"Ratatouille.\" The actor, writer, and stand-up comedian is easily one of the funniest men in Hollywood.\n\nWith his round, cherubic features, messy hair, and scrunched-up face, it’s no surprise that many parents think their children look like him. Looking at this image, we can definitely see the resemblance between these two! We have a feeling that this little boy also has a great sense of humor!\n\nBaby Biff Tannen\n\nThere are some comparisons that people may not want to hear — thankfully, this baby is too young to know the villain they are, unfortunately, being compared to. This father uploaded this picture of their baby comparing him to the villain Biff Tannen from the \"Back to the Future\" franchise.\n\nAlthough it isn't a kind comparison, it's at least one that was found hilarious by dozens of Reddit users. In the sci-fi comedy franchise, Biff Tannen plays the typical mean bully who becomes the film’s antagonist. Let’s hope this baby is a lot kinder than Biff was in the film.\n\nMythbusting Babies\n\nSo, exactly how hard is it to find a needle in a haystack, anyway? And can water dripping on your forehead really drive you nuts? \"Mythbusters\" had it all; from kooky contraptions to dispelling some of the most common myths, the Discovery Channel show quickly became one of the most popular television shows in the world.\n\nHosted by Adam Savage and Jamie Hyneman, the show was humorous and informative as it set out to find which myths are true and which are not. With his hat and thick-framed glasses, this baby looks exactly like the host, Jamie. He looks like he’s ready to bust some myths, but only after nap time!\n\nCome On Down to My Crib\n\nThere are some accessories that just remind us of certain celebrities, such as these thick-framed glasses — a type of eyewear we’ll always associate with actor, comedian, and now game show host Drew Carey. But it's not just the glasses, it's also the chubby face and blond hair that remind us of this comedian.\n\nDrew rose to fame with his hilarious stand-up routines and later as the star of “The Drew Carey Show.” These days, he’s the host of the classic game show, “The Price Is Right.” This baby looks like he’s ready to take the stage as the host of the long-running game show!\n\nJabba the Baby\n\nMost of us find it flattering to be compared to different pop culture icons or other famous figures. That said, some comparisons are just plain rude, like this one to Jabba the Hutt. He was one of the galaxy's most powerful gangsters, with far-reaching influence in both politics and the criminal underworld.\n\nThis parent looked at their baby’s adorably pudgy face and somehow thought it looked like the rotund characters from the \"Star Wars\" franchise. Looking closer, we think they might be right! We have a feeling that this baby probably isn’t too thrilled to be compared to an obese worm-like alien!\n\nPampers and Politics\n\nWhile some babies would be embarrassed to be compared to some pop culture figures, other comparisons are actually quite positive. This person thinks their niece looks exactly like Sir Winston Churchill, the former Prime Minister of the United Kingdom. Hopefully, she will grow out of it by the time she becomes a teenager!\n\nWith those deep-set eyes that stare so intently at the camera and her serious expression, she could easily be related to the revered statesman. While this baby looks like she has some time before she becomes the gifted orator that Churchill was, who knows? Perhaps she has politics in her future?\n\nBaby Vladimir\n\nWhile most babies here resemble well-known singers or actors, we have come across this adorable yet mysterious baby Vladimir. Resembling the Russian leader, baby Vlad seems to enjoy life even at such a young age, as he sits peacefully while chewing on a piece of grass while staring ever so seriously into the camera.\n\nNow that we think of it, is it that most babies resemble Vladimir, or is it the other way around, and it's Vladimir who looks like a baby? Just from comparing these two, all we can gather is that they both seem to have the same blank look on their face.\n\nLike Looking at a Mirror\n\nMost people like to compare babies to their parents or other family members. This mother, however, compared her daughter to award-winning actor Woody Harrelson, and it’s not hard to see why. With their bald heads and similar-looking smiles (though to be fair, Woody has more teeth), we can’t unsee this comparison!\n\nWoody even saw this photo and was so flattered that he dedicated a poem to his tiny twin entitled “Ode to Cora [the baby’s name],” including the lines “Ode to Cora/You’re an adorable child/ Flattered to be compared/ You have a wonderful smile/ I just wish I had your hair.\"\n\nIncredibly Cute Baby From \"The Incredibles\"\n\nDisney’s \"Incredibles\" is one of the most popular and beloved franchises for good reason. It's been lauded as one of Pixar's best-animated movies ever made, from the graphics to the hilarious characters, fans of all ages look forward to these films. This brings us to our next look-a-like!\n\nOne of the most popular (and adorable) members of this superhero family is the little baby named Jack-Jack. While the on-screen version of this character is cute, we think this real-life version of him is even cuter! Looking at this picture, it’s easy to see that his superhero is apparently helping Mom with the laundry!\n\nA Tee-Rific Twin\n\nBefore he became known for his salacious love life and personal issues, Tiger Woods was one of the best and most famous golfers on the planet. While he is still an extremely talented player, the player seems to have taken a bit of time from putting around on the golf course.\n\nPerhaps this little baby is destined to take over his famous twin’s profession — when he’s able to walk and hold a golf club, that is! Considering how much he looks like Tiger, we wouldn’t be surprised if he feels inspired enough to take up golf himself; maybe we'll even see him on the golf course in the future!\n\nCurly Shirley\n\nEvery woman with a baby girl who has gorgeous curly locks would like to admit that her baby looks just like the legend who played adorable and precocious moppets, Shirley Temple. Well, they don't. Not all of them, anyway. However, we can confidentially say that this little girl is the spitting image.\n\nWe've gone through so many look-a-likes, and this one really astounded us. But it's not only the head full of blonde curls that turns this little girl into the child star from the 1930s; it's the cheeky smile and the dazzling bright eyes, which all come together to make for one extra-cute appearance.\n\nWhen Nap Time Gets a Bit “Rocky”\n\nMost parents know that trying to put their children down for nap time can result in a fight that's often more dramatic than any scene from the “Rocky” film franchise. While we’re sure that this little boy goes down for a nap like a champ, he looks exactly like Rocky Balboa’s best friend in the film, Paulie Pennino.\n\nPlayed by Burt Young, Paul is Adrian's older brother and Rocky Balboa's best friend, later his brother-in-law when Rocky marries Adrian. With a fabulous hat and similar scowl to the actor who plays Paulie, Burt Young, this little baby may have a shot of getting cast in future installments of the film!\n\nDoes That Make Baby Crazy?\n\nHe hasn't been around for a few years now, but who could forget Cee Lo Green, the musician who gave us hit singles like \"Crazy\" and \"Forget You\"? We certainly haven't, and this little curmudgeon did well to remind us of our younger years when we were driving around town... Wait, now we're just singing lyrics to his song.\n\nAnyway, before we get too nostalgic, let's focus on how adorable this little kid looks; with glasses like that and his mouth pouting like he's had too much to eat, we wonder if he has as much sass and attitude as CeeLo Green.\n\nFamily (Little) Guy\n\nIt must feel like such an honor to be compared to Seth MacFarlane. Not only is he the creative mind behind the irreverent animated series \"Family Guy\", but he also won numerous Emmy awards for its deep-cut cultural references and often risky political and social satire. But this baby probably hasn't even seen \"Family Guy.\"\n\nAt least we have and are well aware of Seth MacFarlane's accomplishments and his amazing voice-over work. With three original and successful series to his name, as well as frequent voiceover contributions to a number of other series, he is one of our favorite voice actors when it comes to animated comedy.\n\nDo His Parents Look Like Gomez and Morticia?\n\nWith the drawn-on mustache, this little one looks just like baby Pubert from the Addams family. For those who don't remember, He first appeared in Addams Family Values as the newborn son of Gomez Addams and Morticia Addams. He is also the baby brother of Wednesday Addams and Pugsley Addams.\n\nPubert Addams only looked like this when he was healthy, but when he was sick, his hair would go blond, and his mustache would disappear, and he would smile. This undoubtedly would mortify the rest of the family, with his mother becoming upset that he preferred \"The Cat in the Hat.\"\n\nThis Baby Is Under Arrest\n\nHollywood leading man Nick Nolte built a solid career playing a wide range of roles, but this mugshot really made him stand out! This is probably why these parents decided to dress their baby up as Nick Nolte's mugshot for Halloween. All they had to do was find a child-sized Hawaiian shirt and not brush her hair.\n\nEven though the baby was fully committed, by looking like she was wasted and drooling, her portrayal is pretty accurate and looks a lot like Nick Nolte. Although we could also say it's not hard for a baby to act half-asleep and drool, that's basically what they do all the time anyway...\n\nJust One More Thing\n\nWith a fierce expression and his finger wagging like that, this baby is giving Columbo a run for his money, especially when he has one more thing to add, with his catchphrase being \"Just one more thing...\". Columbo was played by Peter Falk, most people will only remember him if they grew up in the 80s.\n\nBut for those who didn't, Columbo wasn't the typical detective whodunit TV show. On this show, viewers see the crime unfold at the beginning of most episodes, but the real mystery and fun for viewers is trying to spot the clues that will lead Lt. Columbo to discover the culprit and watch the tricks he uses to get a confession.\n\nIdentity Theft Is Not a Joke\n\nWe don't care what anyone says; we are 99% sure that this is Dwight Schrute. It's not just that his hair is parted in the middle or that his oversized glasses fit so well on his little nose; it's his mustard yellow shirt and striped tie that convinces us that this is the real Dwight Schrute!\n\nHe even has his identity card with his photo, so it must be the real Dwight Schrute! You wouldn't want to upset him, or he will report you to Michael, or even worse, he'll give you a demerit, which will eventually earn you a citation, and that could lead to a violation!\n\nDown by the River\n\nThis little fella looks like Chris Farley's character from SNL called Matt Foley. Judging from the background, he lives down by the river! He doesn't look too happy about it, but why would he? Matt was always warning kids that if they didn't shape up, they'd end up like him, living in a van, down by the river.\n\nHonestly, we're just glad he came back reincarnated as this little kid. He probably doesn't know it yet, but he's going to be a motivational speaker for churches and schools. If he plays his cards right, he could even get Adam Sandler and David Spade to stop making terrible movies.\n\nHoly Cow!\n\nHarry Christopher Caray was a famous American radio and television sportscaster. He first gained prominence for his telecasts of Chicago Cubs baseball games during the 1980s and '90s. And this little guy looks just like him! From the oversized, thick-rimmed eyeglasses to his cheeky grin, it's uncanny how much they look alike.\n\nHarry Caray became famous for his emphatic use of the expression “Holy cow” whenever he saw something that caught his attention on the field. Soon, he was a beloved figure throughout the United States. Caray would go on to broadcast more than 8,300 baseball games in his 53-year career.\n\nReal Life Jack-Jack\n\nWhen someone tells you your baby looks like Jack-Jack from \"The Incredibles,\" you should definitely lean into it as this guy's parents did and decided to get him a costume to match the animated character. How can anyone not be excited to see how the little hero in training grows up?\n\nHe really does resemble Jack-Jack, the youngest in the Parr family. Jack-Jack might seem like just another typical baby. He laughs and giggles a lot, but he also has superpowers, just like the rest of his family. Jack-Jack even got his own mini-movie, a spin-off from the original, called \"Jack-Jack Attack.\"\n\nGood Job, Little Guy\n\nAfter a successful surgery, this little guy looks a lot like Stewie Griffith from \"Family Guy.\" This little trooper deserves all the cake in the hospital for being so brave, and he's just a little kid! His head may be a bit swollen, but now, at least, he can look forward to recovering.\n\nAnd just look at the joy on his mom's face! She must be elated that her little boy is doing so well. Honestly, both of them should get a prize for having to go through surgery. It's not an easy feat to stay positive through it all, but these two did a smashing job!\n\nA Cabbage Patch Cutie\n\nIf you were a kid who grew up in the 80s or 90s, you’d remember Cabbage Patch Kids. Nearly every kid had one, and while there were many other dolls to choose from, Cabbage kids were different because each one came with a birth certificate and adoption papers, making them feel like real babies.\n\nBut who needs a doll when your baby looks just like a Cabbage kid? If you're a normal human, there's a good chance you want to pinch his little cheeks. Now we want one, but we'll have to settle for a doll from Amazon because, apparently, they still sell them!\n\nFront-Row Seats\n\nSometimes a baby is so cute, just looking at one will cause baby-induced bliss. Pretty crazy, right? Well, other times, looking at a little bundle of joy can remind you of someone you've seen doing a comedy stand-up. That someone is Patton Oswalt, and here is his little look-alike, in baby form.\n\nObviously, there are many reasons to adore your baby, from the smell of their tiny baby heads to their adorable tiny feet, but when they look like one of your favorite comedians, it's a bonus. Who needs a ticket to see Patton Oswalt doing a stand-up routine when you have front-row seats of your baby burping?\n\nBaby Jabba\n\nJabba the Hutt has returned, only this time, in the form of a baby! Only a Star Wars fan would compare their baby to Jabba the Hutt because it is by no means a compliment to compare your baby to the Hutts, who were a large slug-like sentient species that were native to the planet Nal Hutta.\n\nThere's no denying it: Jabba was pretty badass as the galaxy's most powerful gangster, but hopefully, these parents can keep their baby on the straight and narrow. The last thing they'd want to worry about is if their sweet little angel still looks like Jabba in 15 years' time.\n\nIt’s All in the Eyes\n\nCorey Feldman started acting at the tender age of three. With his youthful sense of humor and sweet demeanor, he became one of the cutest child actors of the ‘70s and ‘80s. That cuteness carried over to this kid, who looks exactly like a young Corey Feldman. This little one is looking at the camera with a sleepy pre-naptime look in their eyes.\n\nThat sleepy gaze makes this kid look exactly like Corey Feldman when he was a kid. The soulful stare is so uncanny that it’s hard to believe this isn’t an old photo of Corey himself. While this kid isn’t starring in blockbuster movies anytime soon, we think they could pull it off.\n\nReal-Life Mini-Me\n\nMost newborn babies make this kind of face, but this kid’s parents see something else entirely. When they snapped this photo, they realized their baby resembled Mini-Me from “Austin Powers.” Now that they made the comparison, we can’t unsee it. The resemblance to Verne Troyer is uncanny.\n\nThis kid looks bewildered and taken aback by something, much like Mini-Me looks in most of his “Goldmember” and “The Spy Who Shagged Me” scenes. All this baby needs is a diabolically raised pinky by his lips. He’s almost there because he’s slightly raising his pointer finger. Having no hair isn’t so bad when you get to look like one of the most famous antagonists in comedy history.\n\nThe Adventures of Baby\n\nRed hair is pretty rare, with only about 1-2% of the world’s population exhibiting the trait. This baby has some of the most striking red hair ever. We wouldn’t be surprised if this little one’s mom is constantly taking photos to capture all his cuteness. It was only a matter of time before his mom caught him with his red hair looking wild and extra voluminous.\n\nNow that we think about it, this baby looks a lot like the famous Tintin cartoon from the early-to-mid 20th century. The dramatic swoop of red hair is exactly like the titular character’s animated mop. All this kid needs is a best buddy like Snowy, the Wire Fox Terrier, by his side for his next adventure.\n\nPrince Bride\n\nYou may not know Wallace Shawn by name, but you definitely know his face. Take a look at this baby’s face if you need help jogging your memory. Yeah, Wallace Shawn is the guy from “The Princess Bride,” “Toy Story,” and many other great films. The thing that makes Wallace so memorable is his unique face.\n\nWell, at least we thought his face was unique. Apparently, it’s not as unique as everyone thought. This baby looks exactly like the famous character actor. This baby has mastered Wallace Shawn’s perplexed and slightly curmudgeonly demeanor. If Wallace were to see this picture, it would be like looking in a mirror.\n\nDr. “Dre-by”\n\nSomeone on the internet dubbed this adorable baby “Dr. Dre-by” because they think he looks exactly like a young Dr. Dre. The authentic Dr. Dre is a few decades older, so we can’t say the resemblance is uncanny. Alas, we can’t seem to find any baby pictures of Dr. Dre to compare with this cutie patootie.\n\nNow that we look a little closer, this kid kind of does look like Dre. Their ears are almost identical. We have to admit that this baby is a lot more smiley than Dr. Dre. Appearing too happy in publicity photos would just ruin the rapper and producer’s reputation.\n\nHe Is Not Amused\n\nQuick! Guess “The Simpsons” character that this baby resembles. If you immediately recognized Moe in this little guy’s face, you’d be spot-on. We can’t tell if this kid is unamused by the comparison or if that’s just his regular expression. The ambiguity is very Moe-like.\n\nHonestly, we think getting compared to everyone’s favorite grumpy cartoon bartender is a compliment, not an insult. Everyone loves Moe from “The Simpsons.” We bet everyone loves this baby’s extremely chubby cheeks, too. We just can’t get over how his grumpy little face looks just like a cartoon character’s. It’s not an everyday occurrence.\n\nFuture Mr. President?\n\nIt’s weird to admit, but former President George W. Bush has quite a baby face. If you don’t believe us, take a look at this photo of a literal baby that looks like him. The resemblance is striking, right? Something about the baby’s eyes makes him look like a member of the Bush family.\n\nMaybe it’s the way the real George W. Bush would always seem to be squinting during presidential speeches and interviews. Maybe it’s the kid’s goofy half-smile that’s doing the trick. Whatever the reason, this kid’s uncle swears the resemblance is there and simply had to share with the internet.\n\nCindy Lou, Who?\n\nCartoons always exaggerate particular features, like eyes or hair, for an added “cuteness effect.” This baby is adorable all on her own. Just look at those big blue eyes! Like, how is she even real? Her dad snapped this photo of her on Christmas Day and quickly realized she was giving major Cindy Lou Who energy.\n\nThe big doe eyes, wild hair, and whimsical striped onesie definitely did the trick. She looks like she belongs in Whoville from “How the Grinch Stole Christmas.” If her parents don’t dress her up as Cindy Who for Halloween next year, we’ll be very disappointed that they missed this obvious opportunity.\n\nDoll or Baby?\n\nThis baby looks like a celebrity of a different kind. By “different,” we mean “fictional.” Somehow, some way, this baby looks exactly like a Cabbage Patch Kids doll. You know it’s true. Any child of the ‘80s or ‘90s can recognize those chubby cheeks and giant eyes anywhere.\n\nThe resemblance is a little too uncanny. Are we sure this isn’t a picture of a doll? When you put these pictures side-by-side, it’s hard to tell who is real and who is a fictional doll. All jokes aside, we think this baby girl is even cuter than a Cabbage Patch Kids doll. We just want to squish her little cheeks, but we’ll refrain because we don’t have her permission to do so.\n\nThe Lost Olsen\n\nThis little girl was having a nice day in the snow when her mother snapped a photo of her looking a lot like the little blue-eyed Michelle Tanner from \"Full House.\" In case you have been living under a two-ton rock in the past few decades, Michelle was played by the two identical twins Mary-Kate and Ashley Olsen.\n\nThe two have notoriously left the spotlight many years ago, which is why they weren't a part of the \"Full House\" reboot. However, it seems like they can easily be replaced with this little cutie if anyone is interested in trying to create the beloved sitcom's magic.\n\nWhen Your Kid Finds the Door to John Malkovich's Head\n\nThis baby's mother posted this picture to Instagram and used the hashtag #runnynosedon'tcare. Well, we bet the baby's doppelganger John Cusack will beg to differ. Actually, maybe Cusack wouldn't mind that much. After all, that seems just like common baby stuff.\n\nSometimes they get runny noses and sometimes that runny nose gets caught on camera and John is probably enough of a cool guy to not mind that he looks just like this tot with his drippy nose. Looking at these two images side by side it looks like that runny nose is the only way to tell the two apart!\n\nAbout to Step It Up\n\n\"Has anyone ever told you that you look exactly like Channing Tatum?\" \"Oh, ma'am, you flatter me. But actually yes, I've been hearing it since I was a baby. It's getting a little old, to be honest.\" That's at least how this imaginary conversation went in our head when we tried to think about how this little kid was going to grow up.\n\nAny man with functioning eyeballs would be greatly flattered to know that he resembles the drool-worthy star of \"Step Up\" and \"Magic Mike\", but maybe once you've heard it enough times it kind of loses its effect. We will wait until this little dude grows up to ask him.\n\nOn Her Way to the Office\n\nThis sweet baby girl has the sweetest smile and the squishiest face! Funnily enough, this is not something that people normally say about English comedian Ricky Gervais, and yet the resemblance is uncanny.\n\nWe are sure that both Ricky and the baby are funny in their own way and have their own unique sense of humor. One thing they share with absolutely no difference (okay, maybe some difference) is their face. The baby's mother commented that the only the two would look even more similar is if the mother drew a beard on her. We are still waiting for that bearded picture, Mom.\n\nHey, That's Me!\n\nOne of the things that can make a good story great is when the audience can see themselves in it. This universal truth is obviously a metaphor. People rarely take it literally. But every now and then, you will find some hysterical literal interpretations of it. Just like this baby did when his parents saw the movie poster for \"Look Who's Talking.\"\n\nTurning on the TV and seeing yourself? That is usually an experience reserved only for the celebrity professionals of the entertainment industry, but this blond little nugget got to enjoy it before he could even learn to talk!\n\nHe's Seen Stranger Things\n\nEight-month-old babies rarely have such a full head of thick, lush, curly hair. This one is no exception, apparently, as the mother who posted this picture says that she was just playing around with an elf wig and decided to put it atop her little son's head.\n\nIf you are familiar with the Netflix hit \"Stranger Things\" this baby is going to look familiar. It's going to take a second of \"wait, I know I've seen him somewhere\" before you smack yourself on the forehead and realize this sweetie looks like a teeny tiny version of Gaten Matarazzo who plays the adorable Dustin Henderson in the show.\n\nHe'll Catch a Granade for Ya\n\nIn the basket that this handsome young lad is holding, are grenades he caught for his love, as he promised her in a song. Wait, what? This is not Bruno Mars? *putting glasses on* Well, whaaddaya know! It's a baby with a basket full of the Easter eggs that he just hunted.\n\nThe guy in the feathered fedora is actually the singer who promised some granade cathing to one special lady. While we're at it, he has also promised a variety of other stunts like jumping in front of a train and throwing his hand on a blade. We hope the little dude is not taking notes.\n\nIsn't That Too Young for Discipline?\n\nOkay, so this article features lots of pretty young babies but this must be the youngest of them all. In an ultrasound picture taken before it was even born, this baby managed to give their parents a scare by lining itself up at an angle that made it look like The Punisher.\n\nWell, to be exact, we are not referring to Jon Bernthal, who plays the titular character who is out for revenge in the TV series, but rather his stylized skull logo. Not to worry, the baby will learn all about the best angles once it's out in the world.\n\nIt's in the Squint\n\nBabies are often said to look like lots of sweet little things — angels, delicate flowers, marshmallow peeps with faces — all good things. They are rarely said to look like middle-aged actors with haunted or crazy (depending on the character) eyes. And yet, here we are, with a baby that looks exactly like Steve Buscemi.\n\nUpon closer inspection, this sweet little girl also kind of looks like Andy Serkis's version of Gollum from \"Lord of the Rings.\" Does that make Gollum similar to Steve Buscemi? We have a feeling that there is a scientific rule somewhere that says yes.\n\nWe Need to Talk About Kevin\n\nBabies, just like hair, grow. Kevin from the American sitcom \"The Office,\" however, is one baby who doesn't grow. In case you haven't seen the show, the character is famously slow and unable to save a pot of chili to save his life.\n\nIt's funny to see the two images like that — the baby is deep in newborn bliss and the adult is smiling knowing that his character entertains millions of people worldwide. The baby's hair will grow, unlike Kevin's, which can only take comfort in hair plugs, should he choose to try and regrow what must have been a fabulous mane back in the day.\n\nWhose Baby Is It Anyway?\n\nWhen a new baby is born, anyone who sees it tries to figure out if the little squish face looks more like their father or their mother. But what if the baby looks like neither and instead is a little too reminiscent of one game show host, national treasure Drew Carey?\n\nPeople will argue and pull out family albums trying to plead their case but this picture of the baby in glasses at what appears to be a local supermarket is all the proof we are going to need. It is only a matter of a few short years until the baby grows into the suit he wears while hosting \"The Price Is Right.\"\n\nThe Hills Are Alive\n\n\"King of the Hill\" is a cartoon sitcom that ran for a notable 13 seasons from 1997 to 2010. While most animated shows or movies are usually geared toward a younger audience, this one was meant for the parents to watch after the kids have gone to bed.\n\nSure, there were young characters there, like Bobby Hill, but trust us when we say that he is the last person you want to set an example for your kid. This human, non-cartoon baby looks exactly like the animated Bobby but we are sure her future is going to be a lot brighter (which, to be fair, is not that hard.)\n\nJust Keep Him Away From Birds\n\nThis article has several babies who look like old men. And when we think about it, it kind of makes sense — there is no hair involved and the cheeks look so soft. Add some baby fat to operate as beer gut and you've got yourself a tiny old man.\n\nThis tiny old man happens to resemble a big old man — famed horror filmmaker Alfred Hitchcock. It's all there — the droopy eyes, the bulldog-like cheeks, the nearly see-through eyebrows — if the kid had a suit, a camera, and some raven sound effects we wouldn't have been able to see the difference.\n\nCue the Laughs\n\nJust look at the look on this baby's face. He can't speak just yet but he already knows that he is funny. That kind of charisma is obviously something you were either born with or not and this little dude was clearly born with it. Another thing to support our hypothesis is the fact that he looks almost too similar to actor and comedian Bobby Moynihan of \"Saturday Night Live\" fame.\n\nThe two have the same cheeks, the same chin, and the same mischievous look in their eyes. The only difference we see here is the hair but we are sure that the baby will grow his in no time. Either that or Moynihan will start losing his and meet him halfway.\n\nA Little Something to Putin the Crib\n\nAll parents like to hear that their babies are beautiful. Last time we checked, no parent wanted to hear that their baby looks like the controversial ruler of Russia. While Vladimir Putin is an undisputably handsome and charismatic man (despite his dubious reputation), his features don't really have the same effect when you see them on a tiny human coddled in a blanket.\n\nThe more we look at the baby the less we get the feeling that he needs a hug and instead needs to gather his comrades for a night of vodka in a sketchy bar somewhere cold and snowy.\n\nGetting the Jobs Done\n\nWhen the original poster saw their baby's friend for the first time, they could only think of one thing: My lord, does this little cutie look like Steve Jobs or what? While the late Jobs might not induce any parental instincts, the two have the same smart eyes and the same hairline.\n\nAnd look, the baby is even getting the hand of Steve's signature pose! All he needs is a black turtleneck and a pair of glasses and he will be set to take the world by storm and make billions out of tiny machines we all love to hate.\n\nSir Baby\n\nThere is a surprising number of babies who look like Sir Winston Churchill out there. The late statesman was a formidable personality, which is somewhat surprising when you think of all the things he has in common with a bunch of tiny humans who don't know how to use a fork. Or read. Or poop where you can flush.\n\nThis tot has Churchill's luscious cheeks and his not-as-lush hairline, not to mention the intense gaze he gives the camera. Just give him a hat and a cigar (actually, don't give a cigar to a baby, that's frowned upon, we hear) and he'll be all set to rule Britain.\n\nIt's All in the Surprised Eyebrows\n\nKarl Pilkington made a career out of looking lost and uncomfortable. You might know him as the English actor and comedian behind the TV show \"An Idiot Abroad\" or from his collaborations with Ricky Gervais (who is also featured in this article as a baby lookalike).\n\nThis little nugget manages to look lost and uncomfortable WHILE also being just adorable so from where we are looking at it, the baby wins. Sure, it could be that anything will look adorable coming in such a miniature form but we aren't here to argue, we are just here to share the fun."
