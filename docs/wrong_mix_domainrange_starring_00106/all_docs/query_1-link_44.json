        "text": "Again, we're still vehemently opposed to all the non-substantial updates about the long gestating Ghostbusters 3, and my rant about the long road to the big screen creating too much hype and eventual disappointment still stands. But today some big news comes from Deadline in the form of some studio shuffling that has given the long-gestating sequel a potential production start. In a story about Paramount delaying Ivan Reitman's football comedy Draft Day, the reason given for the push is because Reitman \"is expected to finally get the long-gestating Ghostbusters reboot in front of the cameras next summer.\" What?\n\nThis is one of those\"we'll believe it when we see it\" scenarios, but if Paramount is making production decisions on other films (Draft Day doesn't have enough time to finish production before Ghostbusters 3 would start shooting) so that the sequel can go in front of cameras for Sony, that seems to be a good guarantee that this film is finally happening. Plus, if the film starts shooting next summer, it would likely get a release in 2014, just in time for the 30th anniversary of the original film. Etan Coen (Men in Black III and Tropic Thunder) penned the most recent draft of the script that will see the original Ghostbusters (though Bill Murray isn't coming back) passing the torch to some new faces.\n\nThe question now is how soon might we get some new casting for the sequel? Dan Aykroyd said he likes Matthew Gray Gubler from (500) Days of Summer, but the studio is going to want some big names. Honestly, I think my picks for the new Ghostbusters would have to be Bill Hader and Seth Rogen (their cop characters in Superbad were hilarious) along with Donald Glover and Emma Stone as the first female Ghostbuster. And if Bill Murray isn't coming back, it'd be nice if Harold Ramis, Dan Aykroyd and Ernie Hudson could coax Rick Moranis out of retirement for at least a cameo. What do you think?"
