        "text": "\"What was Hollywood thinking? They can't get rid of actors just because they starred in a bad movie that flopped or got negative reception, people didn't want to care about them anymore, or they were controversial figures who were criminals, and then treat the rest of us like we're their puppets? Actors need to have a break once in a while when they're in movies, not star in a movie every year like slaves just because they're popular.\"\n\n— Patrick Warburton\n\nNOTE: While this practice is also on the AMW (which has now since been defunct), it can go here due to having \"Bad Qualities\" and \"Good Qualities\" sections and, while this practice is usually unfair to many actors in the industry, it can sometimes be seen as a benefit as it can be justifiable in some cases.\n\nYou know that saying \"When you're hot, you're hot, when you're not, you're not?\" Well, the industry has that mentality too when it comes to employing actors and actresses based on their relevance, and then eventually forgetting about them once they have had their big break, thus leading to them getting fewer, minimal, or even no parts at all, just so the industry can cast more popular ones and forget about the other ones.\n\nThis has always been a problem in the industry, as actors who were once popular or beloved at the time eventually faded into obscurity with them getting only fewer parts than usual, or only got supporting or minor roles in movies or even TV series (usually in mentor-like roles to the main character), and were replaced by the more relevant actors, however, some of the fading ones still showed up every now and then, but not as often as they used to. However, it got even worse in the mid-2010s, where mostly every well-known actor who frequently (or sometimes) appeared up until then nearly were forgotten about by the industry completely, just so the industry could employ the more popular ones like Dwayne Johnson, Kevin Hart, Gal Gadot, Tom Holland, Chris Hemsworth, Ryan Reynolds, Scarlett Johansson, Charlize Theron, Jessica Chastain, Jason Statham, Idris Elba, Will Arnett, Rachel McAdams, Gary Sinise, Keanu Reeves, and Patrick Warburton leaving some of the ones who were already popular in previous decades like Denzel Washington, Jim Carrey, Sandra Bullock, Halle Berry, Adam Sandler, Will Ferrell, Bill Murray, Morgan Freeman, Antonio Banderas, Leonardo DiCaprio, Jennifer Garner, and Martin Lawrence to eventually fade away and be forgotten about as a result, just to pander to younger audiences nowadays, simply because the industry seems to think that younger audiences now won't care about actors from their parents' younger days like Eddie Murphy, Mike Myers, Ashton Kutcher, Diedrich Bader, Jeff Bridges, or Steve Buscemi even if this was proven otherwise.\n\nNow the reasoning for why many actors fade away can be justifiable enough: maybe it's due to old age, maybe audiences lost interest in the actor (or even the opposite, maybe the actor just wasn't interesting to audiences or maybe they weren't profitable enough), maybe the actor was even a heinous/toxic/egotistical or at least controversial person who actually bullied other people and hurt them or similarly, maybe the actor was in movies that were either box office flops or were universally polarized therefore giving them a negative reputation, or maybe they were typecast too often in the same role or genre. However, other times it is proven that the actor was simply selfishly forgotten about by the industry and were \"thrown under the bus\" just because another actor became popular unexpectedly and got more parts than the other actor, even if said actor was already popular in the past, which is already bad, but even worse if the actor was an overlooked B-list or C-list actor (but still had a sizable fanbase) or even a child actor. All in all, it is still sad nonetheless as these once beloved actors suddenly get ditched by the industry.\n\nNotable Examples of once popular or beloved actors that are now fading or washed-up actors:\n\nNOTE: Actors who have since retired can still count only if they were already fading away or falling off around the time of their retirement, and hence can be listed below. Deceased actors cannot count as they have passed away, even if they had fallen off by the time of their deaths, and if any actors on the list below pass away, then they should be removed out of respect.\n\nMiles Teller: While he was a promising young up-and-coming star in the early-to-mid 2010s, he made the unfortunate decision to appear in the 2015 Fantastic Four reboot which severely diminished any potential he had in the industry until then, and didn't appear in any movies after Only the Brave and Thank You for Your Service and Top Gun: Maverick and Spiderhead, and only showed up in the 2019 miniseries Too Old to Die Young during the 2017-2022 period. However, there is a possibility that Top Gun: Maverick might revive his career.\n\nLeonardo DiCaprio: While he's still a fairly popular household name, he had suddenly fallen off after The Wolf of Wall Street to focus more on his environmental activism, despite being a big star from the 1990s to the early 2010s. This became more evident when he announced his break from acting after winning his Oscar in 2016. He was just as easily sidelined as a result by the industry, only appearing in Once Upon a Time in Hollywood, Don't Look Up, and Killers of the Flower Moon.\n\nDenzel Washington: Despite being a big star and box office powerhouse in the 1990s, the 2000s, and the early 2010s, he seems to have veered into this territory from 2014 onwards, and especially from 2018 onwards, as well. Despite this, however, he still remains popular amongst moviegoers and moderately successful, though he has faded almost into obscurity at this point.\n\nJack Nicholson: He never appeared in a movie since the romantic comedy How Do You Know, released way back in 2010! It wasn't until nine years later in 2019 when it was confirmed that he retired from voice acting.\n\nBenjamin Bratt: Although he was a very big star in the 2000s and the 2010s, he was somehow fallen off after the failure of Strange Magic.\n\nRussell Crowe: Seems to have been forgotten about during the 2010s, though he did appear in The Nice Guys alongside Ryan Gosling and also Thor: Love and Thunder, though even then, those were past his prime.\n\nRyan Gosling: While he was a big star in the 2010s, he did not appear in another movie after Blade Runner 2049 for three years until The Gray Man and Barbie, though even after that, audiences stopped caring about him.\n\nViola Davis: Was sidelined after the box office failure of Black Adam, which presumably caused her to fade into obscurity until the success of Kung Fu Panda 4 managed to save her career big time.\n\nWill Ferrell: Because of the failure of Holmes and Watson, the industry outright rejected him for the most part, though this became evident since 2015, where he became one of those washed-up comedy actors trying to stay relevant by appearing in comedy films alongside more popular comedic actors. However, between him and the other five members of the Frat Pack (Ben Stiller, Owen Wilson, Luke Wilson, Vince Vaughn, and Jack Black), he still remains a household name and is still fairly popular, with only fellow Frat Pack members not far behind either, and he plans to retire after Despicable Me 4 comes out in 2024.\n\nElijah Kelley: Because of the failure of Strange Magic, the industry nearly rejected him and made him become washed up into obscurity. However, he did return in Avatar: The Way of Water, but even after that, audiences still stopped caring about him.\n\nJason Statham: Best known to appear in the Fast and the Furious franchise, but it wasn’t until the failure of Meg 2: The Trench managed to sideline him from the industry.\n\nMorgan Freeman: Even he of all people was not immune to this, as he fell off around 2013-2015 and started to appear less often, but nevertheless he is still thankfully popular thanks to his influence on society. Still, compare that to the 2000s where he was still fairly everywhere.\n\nAntonio Banderas: He was suddenly forgotten about during the 2010s, mostly appearing in movies made in his homeland Spain if not direct-to-video movies, his career was predominantly recovered after the success of Puss in Boots: The Last Wish.\n\nSharon Stone: Has completely vanished in the 2010s, though her arrogant nature might have had something to do with it.\n\nMichael Douglas: He had pretty much faded back into obscurity during the 2010s, he made a return in Netflix’s Green Eggs and Ham and Urban Jungle, which saved his career from further downfall.\n\nBaoan Coleman: Best known for his role in Rambo: First Blood II and appeared in countless movies and tv shows throughout the 80s and 90s. He disappeared from the acting industry in 2002 after the release of his final movie, Hey Arnold! The Movie. There was no explanation that had been given for his sudden disappearance and his current whereabouts remain unknown.\n\nWolfgang Puck: Was sidelined from the industry during the 2010s.\n\nAdam Sandler: Best known for appearing in rather controversial comedy movies made by his infamous production company Happy Madison Productions, the critical failure of his 2015 movie Pixels critically endangered his career. Ever since, he and his production company started only making movies for Netflix for now on. That also eventually led him to being kicked out of the cast of Hotel Transylvania: Transformania, being replaced by Brian Hull respectively.\n\nJackie Chan: He primarily does dubbing work these days as result of his advancing age and all the injuries he's sustained over the years, his career was badly impacted after the failure of The Nut Job 2.\n\nGary Oldman: Was sidelined after the failure of Planet 51, it felt like he was going to fade away into obscurity until he appeared in Kung Fu Panda 2 back in 2011 and Oppenheimer in 2023, which both managed to help him big time.\n\nJohnny Depp: While he was popular in the 1980s, 1990s, and 2000s, he had fallen off in the 2010s. Amber Heard defaming him and destroying his reputation didn't help him either.\n\nNick Nolte: Has been seen rarely after the failure of Zookeeper in 2011, so audiences stopped caring about him.\n\nWill Smith: Had considerably fallen off when After Earth became a flop, but this still led to the industry giving him big parts (making him remain fairly popular, but less so compared to other actors on the rise or actors who the industry focused more on) to give him another chance, all of which remaining true until the infamous incident where he slapped Chris Rock at the 2022 oscars, therefore tarnishing his reputation for good. Even if his career wasn't doing particularly great after After Earth being a flop, this is what ended up ruining his career big time, not even the box office failure of Spies in Disguise couldn’t help him either.\n\nTim Robbins: He had appeared less often come the 2010s, and hasn't been seen in a movie since 2019.\n\nSylvester Stallone: He had fallen off after Spy Kids 3-D: Game Over and Zookeeper, with that mostly killing his career. He did have a slight career resurgence in the mid 2010s, though that was still way past his prime.\n\nMr. T: Was somehow neglected about during the 2010s, after his health issues and how he spoke about a man who sexually assaulted him, audiences stopped caring about him occasionally, which lead him to being kicked out of the production of Cloudy with a Chance of Meatballs 2, being replaced by Terry Crews respectively.\n\nGreg Kinnear: This suave \"ladies' man\" actor who was everywhere in the 2000s was suddenly sidelined to supporting and minor roles in the 2010s.\n\nDavid Spade: His career was mostly killed by his involvement in the Grown Ups duology.\n\nKatie Holmes: Though she was a promising actress in the industry during the 2000s, she was sidelined during the 2010s.\n\nCedric the Entertainer: He has rarely been seen after Sex Tape, which basically killed his career.\n\nAndy Dick: His controversial but extremely stubborn behavior and wrongdoings caused him to be forgotten about and fade into obscurity during the late 2000s or early 2010s.\n\nSusan Sarandon: Once at her prime mostly during the 1990s and up until the late 2000s, she was only sporadically seen during the 2010s.\n\nJim Carrey: His career was so severely hurt by 2014's Dumb and Dumber To that the industry mostly didn't want to employ him anymore. His erratic personal life didn't help, either, causing him to retire from acting after Sonic the Hedgehog 2. The cancellation of a Horton Hears a Who! sequel after Blue Sky's closure in 2021 didn’t help him either. Carrey himself was also disappointed that Blue Sky closed down due to their last three movies all being box office failures.\n\nTom Cruise: While he is still thankfully popular enough to not have faded into obscurity at this point, his infamous ties to the Church of Scientology caused the industry to doubt him (though this makes them hypocritical in the fact that they are willing to employ other big-name Scientologists despite the controversies surrounding the Church), and eventually he became a laughing stock of the industry during the mid-2010s, but Top Gun: Maverick could revive his career.\n\nDrew Barrymore: Once a very popular child star of the 1980s, with subsequent attention in the 1990s and 2000s, she fell off during the mid-2010s. Nowadays she hosts her own talk show: The Drew Barrymore Show.\n\nEdward Norton: The industry sidelined him after his controversial behavior on the set of The Incredible Hulk. This caused the industry to finally believe that he was difficult to work with, his career was horribly obliterated after the negative reception of Sausage Party.\n\nOwen Wilson: He had suffered a career-killing movie in Marmaduke, and while has doing decent in 2011-2013, most of the movies he appeared in during then were flops. Eventually, he was sidelined by the industry from 2014 onwards, not even appearing in anything from 2017 to 2021. However, he started to get a slight resurgence in early 2021 by appearing in the series Loki, but that's still not enough, and much like fellow Frat Pack members, he still remains a household name.\n\nAl Pacino: He had suddenly disappeared in the mid-to-late 2000s, and was almost completely sidelined in the 2010s, mainly due to his advancing age.\n\nGeena Davis: She had fallen off because of her 1995 film Cutthroat Island being a flop. Not even The Long Kiss Goodnight, released the following year, could save her career.\n\nJesse Eisenberg: After Social Network, the Rio duology, and Batman vs Superman: Dawn of Justice, he has disappeared from the industry and there by fourth never appeared in a single movie ever again.\n\nJude Law: Was sidelined by the industry during the 2010s.\n\nJaden Smith: He had suddenly fallen off after the failure of After Earth, causing him to take a break from acting to focus more on his music. However, he's had a bit of a resurgence in recent years.\n\nGeorge Clooney: Was sidelined by the industry during the 2010s.\n\nNatalie Portman: Around 2012-2013 she had suddenly fallen off most likely due to the mixed reception of 2013's Thor: The Dark World, mostly appearing in indie films since, with the occasional exception. However, she did recently reprise her role as Jane Foster in 2022's Thor: Love and Thunder.\n\nNaomi Watts: Was sidelined by the industry during the 2010s.\n\nJada Pinkett-Smith: Was sidelined by the industry during the 2010s, mainly because the Madagascar franchise concluded in 2012 and also being hard to work with.\n\nSean Hayes: While the industry never particularly showed him love, he was sporadically seen since the mid-2010s, but his career was ruined big time after appearing in The Emoji Movie.\n\nRob Schneider: Has rarely been seen since Grown Ups, even within the Happy Madison Productions side of things, but his career was atrociously killed after appearing in Norm of the North.\n\nMartin Lawrence: Likely as a result of being typecast too often in comedies, Big Momma's: Like Father, Like Son seemed to be a career-killing movie for him. It took him nine years to appear in another big budget movie until Bad Boys For Life as well as its sequel, Bad Boys: Ride or Die, and plans to retire after Urban Jungle: The Next Adventure ends. His career now mostly relies on the Urban Jungle franchise and once it ends, so will his career.\n\nDolph Lundgren: Was sidelined by the industry during the 2010s, even Minions: The Rise of Gru could not save his career.\n\nDana Carvey: The failure of The Master of Disguise caused him to go an an eight-year hiatus to take care of his family. Even after his hiatus, it does not seem like he will have a true career resurgence, likely due to his andvancing age.\n\nRobert Patrick: Was sidelined by the industry during the 2010s after the box office failure of Five Minarets in New York.\n\nJulia Roberts: While she was everywhere in the 1990s and 2000s, ever since the 2010s she was forgotten about, most likely due to her reputation of being difficult to work with.\n\nJames Franco: Had fallen off around 2014 or 2015; his sexual assault allegations made it worse, to the point where even his friend Seth Rogen turned his back on him in 2021 by saying he won't collaborate with him anymore. Franco himself actually admitted to these allegations in a December 2021 interview, not even the negative reception of Sausage Party couldn’t help him either. Eventually, he went dark after that, appearing in mostly supporting roles.\n\nJack Black: Was sidelined about in the 2010s due to the unfortunate mistake of appearing in the 2010 film Gulliver's Travels (which sadly killed his career at least as a leading man), only getting supporting roles nowadays, though he had have another moment in the spotlight in The Super Mario Bros. Movie in 2023 and Kung Fu Panda 4 as of this year, and he did have a bit of a career resurgence in 2017 with Jumanji: Welcome to the Jungle but, even then, that still didn't save his career. While he has faded slightly, he still remains a household name despite this, like fellow Frat Pack members were not too far behind, despite the both of them having faded too.\n\nChris Rock: He had somewhat fallen off in the mid-2010s. However, he is starting to show some resurgence now since 2017, and because of the Will Smith slapping incident, it seems like Hollywood is sorry for him and might give him a comeback.\n\nNicolas Cage: Is essentially an industry laughingstock at this point, mostly appearing in DTV action movies these days.\n\nTim Allen: His career was basically killed after appearing in Zoom: Academy for Superheroes, The Santa Clause 3: The Escape Clause, and The Shaggy Dog, and he had fallen on hard times ever since. Not even the mixed reception of Ralph Breaks the Internet didn’t help him either.\n\nSteve Zahn: Was sidelined by the industry during the 2010s, after the box office failure of The Good Dinosaur.\n\nChristine Baranski: Was sidelined by the industry during the 2010s.\n\nMel Gibson: His infamous drunken anti-Semitic rant basically killed his career, although he had a bit of a resurgence in 2016.\n\nRene Russo: She became unheard of by the start of the 2010s.\n\nLouis C.K.: His career took a downturn when he admitted to his 2017 sexual allegations. This caused the industry to reject and forget about him in an instant, as well as being kicked out of the production of The Secret Life of Pets 2, being replaced by Patton Oswalt.\n\nNick Swardson: The failure of Bucky Larson: Born to Be a Star killed his chances as a leading man in a comedy.\n\nJamie Foxx: The combined 2014 failures of The Amazing Spider-Man 2, Rio 2, and Annie basically killed his career as he did not appear in another movie until 2017. However, he is starting to show some resurgence with the successes of Soul and Spider-Man: No Way Home, along with having a bunch of projects in the works.\n\nBen Stiller: The failure of Zoolander 2 killed his career almost indefinitely; nowadays he produces more stuff than he acts in them, and mostly appears in minor roles. Unlike fellow Frat Pack members, he has since lost his household name status.\n\nKevin James: The brutal failure of Paul Blart: Mall Cop 2 almost killed his career and since then, he stars in only Netflix projects (except for the first three Hotel Transylvania movies and Pixels). Not even Urban Jungle could save his career.\n\nChevy Chase: Thanks to his arrogant nature, he faded into obscurity in the mid-2000s and especially during the 2010s.\n\nMatthew Broderick: Was forgotten about during the 2000s and 2010’s, not even the mixed reception of Wonder Park didn’t help him either.\n\nEddie Murphy: His 2012 movie A Thousand Words managed to kill his career (mainly as a result of him appearing in too many comedies); ever since, he appeared in Mr. Church, but he didn't manage to make a real comeback until Dolemite Is My Name. Nowadays, he only appears in supporting roles.\n\nSteve Buscemi: Was sidelined by the industry during the 2010s, his career took a downturn after appearing in The Boss Baby, so audiences decided to care less about him.\n\nKenan Thompson: Was sidelined during the 2010s after the failure of Playmobil: The Movie.\n\nMike Myers: Has rarely been seen after the failure of The Love Guru, but his appearance in Shrek Forever After manage to help his career from further downfall.\n\nZooey Deschanel: Has also rarely been seen after The Love Guru, which obviously killed her career. Not even the Trolls trilogy or Urban Jungle could save her career. Although, it could be possible that Harold and the Purple Crayon might revive her career.\n\nUma Thurman: Was sidelined by the industry during the 2010s.\n\nTim Roth: Was sidelined by the industry during the 2010s.\n\nMatthew McConaughey: He was mostly forgotten about during the early 2010s until 2014, when the positive reception of Interstellar and the Sing franchise both saved his career big time.\n\nMike Epps: Was sidelined by the industry during the 2010s, mainly due to the box office failure of Open Season 2 in 2008, the movie he starred in didn’t kill his career, it was just the poor box office failure that sidelined him, but his career was ruined big time after appearing in Madame Web.\n\nIce Cube: Was sidelined by the industry during the 2010s. In his case, this also happened in the music industry.\n\nChris Tucker: Was mostly forgotten about after Rush Hour 3.\n\nMichael Cera: He has been facing a bit of trouble ever since, after the failures of Sausage Party and Paws of Fury: The Legend of Hank.\n\nDanny Glover: Was sidelined during the 2010s due to his atrocious behavior, controversy, and racism.\n\nJet Li: While he was a big action star in the late 1990s and 2000s, he faded back into obscurity during the 2010s.\n\nVing Rhames: Was sidelined after the failure of The Garfield Movie.\n\nAaron Eckhart: Faded into obscurity after the critical and commercial failure of I, Frankenstein.\n\nJosh Hartnett: Once a popular young adult actor during the late 1990s and 2000s, he was sidelined during the 2010s.\n\nVal Kilmer: His reputation for being difficult to work with led to his career declining. His diagnosis with throat cancer also limited his roles.\n\nWesley Snipes: He spent three years in prison for tax evasion, which severely affected his career.\n\nBruce Willis: His career was sidelined during the 2010s and gained a reputation for being difficult to work with. In 2022, he announced his retirement due to a diagnose of aphasia.\n\nCuba Gooding Jr.: He made some infamously bad choices after winning an Oscar for Jerry Maguire to the point where he became a punchline.\n\nBrendan Fraser: His career was sidelined in the 2010s due to depression, divorce, health issues and speaking out about a man who sexually assaulted him, even the negative reception of Escape from Planet Earth and The Nut Job didn’t help either.\n\nJohn Cusack: His career was sidelined in the 2010s, most likely due to the failure of Igor and 2012.\n\nCameron Diaz: The combined 2014 failures of Sex Tape and Annie caused her to retire after that.\n\nJoan Cusack: She hasn’t appeared in a single movie in the 2020’s, she took a break from voice acting after the critical acclaim of Klaus in 2019.\n\nCatherine Zeta-Jones: Her career sidelined in the 2010s due to personal issues.\n\nGene Hackman: He hasn't appeared in a movie since Welcome to Mooseport in 2003. He has since retired.\n\nJohn Travolta: His career hasn't been the same since the infamous failure of his vanity project Battlefield Earth. His links to Scientology also haven't helped his reputation.\n\nAllison Mack: Though she was a promising young star in the late 1980s and throughout the 1990s and 2000s, best known as Chloe Sullivan in Smallville, her career fell apart due to her sexual abuse allegations involving NXIVM that led to her arrest in 2018, but even before then she was sidelined during the 2010s after Smallville ended in 2011.\n\nJean-Claude Van Damme: His career declined in the late nineties due to his growing ego and personal problems, but he is getting some resurgence after when he appeared in Kung Fu Panda 2 back in 2011 and Minions: The Rise of Gru in 2022, which both helped his career big time.\n\nSteven Seagal: He torpedoed his own career with his growing ego to the point where he become a punchline. His shady personal life didn't do his reputation any favors.\n\nKiefer Sutherland: Despite being a popular movie and television actor, he was mostly forgotten about after the negative reception of The Wild, not even Monsters Vs. Aliens, which was released three years later, could save his career.\n\nMichael J. Fox: He was forced to retire from acting in 2020 due to his declining health from Parkinson's disease, but even before then he was sidelined during the 2000s or 2010s.\n\nCharlie Sheen: His career hasn't been the same since he was fired from Two and a Half Men as a result of his chaotic and hedonistic personal life.\n\nFaye Dunaway: Her career hasn't been the same since the high profile failure of Mommie Dearest. She also gained a reputation as being an absolute nightmare to work with.\n\nChristian Slater: His career sidelined in the 2000s, though he managed to gain notable parts on the stage and on television and shake off his bad boy reputation.\n\nArnold Schwarzenegger: Even with his household name status, he had suddenly fallen off by the early 2000s, and was temporarily forced to quit acting to serve as Governor of California from 2003 to 2011.\n\nAlfonso Ribeiro: Once known as the lovable Carlton Banks in the popular 1990s sitcom The Fresh Prince of Bel Air (which ran from 1990 to 1996 for six seasons) after slowly rising to fame in the mid-to-late 1980s, he was suddenly forgotten about after appearing in the movie Love Wrecked, which was released back in 2005! He was sidelined in the mid-2000s onward, and the fact that he didn't appear in many movies and mainly stuck to television roles might not have helped him either. Nowadays, he currently hosts America's Funniest Home Videos, taking the position of host since Tom Bergeron quit in 2015.\n\nCarla Gugino: While she was a promising though sadly overlooked star in the mid-to-late 1990s and especially throughout the 2000s with films such as Snake Eyes, the first three Spy Kids movies, Sin City, the original Night at the Museum, American Gangster, Watchmen, and Race to Witch Mountain, and even shows such as Spin City, Karen Sisco, and Entourage under her belt, she was sadly sidelined by the industry after her three big-budget 2011 outings Sucker Punch, Mr. Popper's Penguins, and New Year's Eve and forgotten about, likely due to her tendency to appear in supporting/minor roles rather than leading roles. She has since mostly only appeared in indie/arthouse films as well as shows such as the first season of Wayward Pines and Jett. That being said, she does still show up every now and again in films like San Andreas, The Space Between Us, and Gunpowder Milkshake, and Mike Flanagan has been giving her chances with his Netflix projects like Gerald's Game and The Haunting of Hill House recently, so she still might have potential.\n\nPatrick Dempsey: While he was a popular actor especially during the 2000s, he was mostly sidelined after 2010 as audiences started to lose interest in him. He even departed from his infamous role as Dr. Derek Shepherd in the medical drama television series Grey's Anatomy, which might not have helped him either, though he did return in season 17 from 2020 to 2021.\n\nMichael Keaton: Was sidelined by the industry during the 2010s most likely due to the mixed reception of Minions.\n\nMira Sorvino: Was sidelined by the industry during the 2010s.\n\nJim Belushi: Was sidelined by the industry by the start of the 2010s.\n\nJason Segel: Has rarely been seen after Sex Tape, which probably killed his career. However, he later made a successful comeback in the adult tv show Urban Jungle.\n\nLuke Wilson: After the mixed reception of Rock Dog, he has slowly faded back into obscurity as the 2010s progressed, basically becoming unheard of by 2019. Like fellow Frat Pack members Ben Stiller and Vince Vaughn, he has since lost his household name status.\n\nPierce Brosnan: Was sidelined during the 2010s.\n\nJeff Goldblum: He was mostly sidelined during the 2010s, but both Jurassic World: Fallen Kingdom, The Boss Baby: Family Business, and Jurassic World: Dominion abhorrently tainted his career. He will mostly become unheard also due to his advancing age and his health problems, causing everybody to reject and forget about him, this got him kicked out of the production of Urban Jungle 3: A Crazy Adventure, replaced by John Travolta respectively.\n\nSigourney Weaver: Was suddenly forgotten by the time the 2010s started, after Finding Dory came out way back in 2016.\n\nChristopher Mintz-Plasse: The once promising rising child actor, best known for his role as \"McLovin\" in the 2007 teen comedy Superbad, was suddenly forgotten about during the mid-2010s. Not even the positive reception of the How to Train Your Dragon and Trolls franchises were able to provide enough help for him.\n\nJennifer Jason Leigh: Was sidelined by the industry during the 2000s, though she had a slight resurgence in the 2010s, it was not enough.\n\nMalin Akerman: Once an \"it girl\" who celebrated her fifteen minutes of fame with Watchmen, she had suddenly fallen off around the mid-2010s, mostly going dark with indie films ever since.\n\nVince Vaughn: Since 2015, he had only been appearing in supporting roles.

Her erratic personal life, arrogant nature, and reputation for being difficult to work with on her sitcom didn't do her any favors. However, she did get a slight resurgence in early 2018 with the revival of Roseanne, though that wouldn't last long, as her infamously offensive tweet she posted about former Obama administration official Valerie Jarrett in May of that year caused her show to get cancelled and later re-tooled as a spin-off called The Conners without the involvement of Barr, whose character was killed off from an opioid overdose. This also caused the industry to reject and forget about her, therefore tarnishing Barr's reputation for good. Even if her career wasn't doing particularly great after Home on the Range, this is what ended up wrecking her career big time.\n\nAlan Cumming: Was sidelined by the industry during the 2010s after the negative reaction of Strange Magic and Show Dogs.\n\nHalle Berry: A once popular actress during the 1990s and 2000s, she had since been sidelined during the 2010s.\n\nRick Moranis: His career was horribly hit due to the failure of The Adventures of Rocky and Bullwinkle, and he decided to retire seven years later in 2007 and host his own show, The Rick Moranis Show.

She went dark after that, appearing in lower-scale movies.\n\nJonathan Lipnicki: The once promising child actor, who appeared in films like Jerry Maguire, the first two Stuart Little films, The Little Vampire, and Like Mike, had potential for a bigger career in Hollywood, but was suddenly forgotten about after Stuart Little 2 was released back in 2002.

However, she had a bit of a resurgence in 2022 with her eponymous documentary series for Lifetime and A&E.\n\nRihanna: Was sidelined in the mid-2010s, most likely due to the mixed reception of Home. In her case, this also happened in the music industry, primarily due to her being focused on her beauty and fashion lines.\n\nClark Duke: This once promising star who rose in the early 2010s and had potential to have a bigger career was suddenly forgotten about after 2015 due to the failure of Hot Tub Time Machine 2.\n\nJulia Stiles: Her \"it girl\" status, which started in 1999's 10 Things I Hate About You, ended in the early 2010s, and she was just as suddenly sidelined.\n\nAdrien Brody: Once a very promising star in the 2000s, he was sadly forgotten about during the 2010s.\n\nJason Schwartzman: Once a very promising star in the 2000s, he was sadly forgotten about during the 2010s after the box office failure of Fantastic Mr. Fox in 2009, but his career was saved after the critical acclaim of Klaus and Urban Jungle.\n\nTeri Hatcher: Was sidelined during the 2010s, likely due to her reputation of being difficult to work with.\n\nJeremy Piven: While he was a big star in the 1990s and 2000s, he was sadly forgotten about during the 2010s.\n\nRob Corddry: Was forgotten about due to the failure of Hot Tub Time Machine 2, and has since went dark, not even the negative reception of Escape from Planet Earth didn’t help him either.\n\nSteve Carell: While he's still, in some ways, a household name because he's still remembered for his roles in The 40-Year Old Virgin, Little Miss Sunshine, the Despicable Me franchise, the Anchorman duology, and especially in the first seven seasons of the American remake of The Office, he started to lose some of his fame after he left The Office in 2011, and especially around 2014-2015 as audiences started to lose interest in him, to the point where, after 2014 or 2015, he became a punchline. Despite this, he is still seen occasionally and is again still a household name.\n\nRainn Wilson: Was mostly forgotten about once The Office ended back in 2013.\n\nB.J.

He has since faded into obscurity, mostly going dark by producing most of his own stuff.\n\nJim Caviezel: Due to his religious beliefs getting in the way of his career, he was understandably sidelined during the 2010s.\n\nDave Chappelle: In a rare case of an actor deliberately doing this on purpose due to the stress in the industry, he fell off during the mid-2000s while filming the third season of Chappelle's Show, by unceremoniously vacationing and laying low in South Africa and declaring fame and the spotlight too stressful for his mental health, part of it being due to his increasing disdain towards Chappelle's Show. He was also a big star in the 1990s and early-to-mid 2000s up until then. However, he's had a bit of a resurgence in recent years.\n\nKate Beckinsale: While she was fairly big in the 2000s, she was forgotten about during the 2010s.\n\nNoah Ringer: The poor failure of The Last Airbender killed his potential as a rising young star in the industry. Not even Cowboys & Aliens, released the following year, could save his career. Eventually, he became unheard of by the mid-2010s.\n\nJadon Sand: While he was a promising child star who appeared in The Lego Movie and had potential to have a bigger career, he had suddenly faded back into obscurity after 2019 when The Lego Movie 2: The Second Part became a flop at the box office and The Affair ended.\n\nJake Lloyd: He was a promising young child star in the mid-to-late 1990s up until Star Wars Episode I: The Phantom Menace, which sadly killed his career.

Simmons: He was a very popular actor in the 2000’s and 2010’s, but his career was almost ruined after the negative reception of Marmaduke in 2022, but Urban Jungle thankfully saved his career.\n\nCeeLo Green: After the box office success of Hotel Transylvania in 2012, he was indiscriminately sidelined from the industry during the 2010s. In some cases, this also happened in the music industry, which got him kicked out of the cast of the last three Hotel Transylvania sequels, being replaced by Keegan-Micheal Key respectively.\n\nMax Charles: Once a very promising child star in the 2010s, he was suddenly forgotten about once The Lion Guard ended in 2019.\n\nJack McBrayer: He has rarely been seen after the failure of Annie, which basically killed his career.

His controversial and erratic behavior, sexual assault allegations, fake bomb threat incident, and reputation for being difficult to work with on Silicon Valley made things worse for him to the point where the industry mostly doesn't want to employ him anymore, as well as being kicked from How to Train Your Dragon: The Hidden World, being replaced by Justin Rupple respectively.\n\nAnna Faris: While she was popular in the 2000s and the early 2010s, she started to appear less often in the mid-to-late 2010s after the positive reception of Cloudy with a Chance of Meatballs 2, mostly appearing in the sitcom Mom until she left the show in 2020, as well as getting minor or supporting roles in 22 Jump Street, Alvin and the Chipmunks: The Road Chip, and Keanu. Eventually, The Emoji Movie and the remake of Overboard seemed to be career-killing movies for her as she did not appear in another movie when until 2022. Even Urban Jungle couldn't save her career.\n\nSteven Wright: Even though he was popular in the 2000s and 2010s, he was somehow forgotten about after he left the sitcom Friends in 2012, and around 2013-2016 he was forgotten about, only appearing in supporting roles in Dolphin Tale 2, Home, and Finding Dory.

Austin: Once a promising young star in the 2000s and early-to-mid 2010s, he started to lose some of his fame after he left The Fosters in 2015, causing him to appear less often from 2016 to mid-2017, to the point where he made the unfortunate mistake of appearing in the 2017 movie The Emoji Movie, which severely diminished any potential he had in the industry and caused him to be forgotten about. He went dark after that, appearing in low-scale movies.\n\nHannibal Burgess: His career was sidelined from the mid 2010’s to 2022 after the divisive reception of The Angry Birds Movie, but his career was predominantly saved after appearing in Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Mutant Mayhem.\n\nMaya Rudolph: She has been facing a lot of trouble ever since, after the failures of The Nut Job franchise, Strange Magic, and The Angry Birds Movie, it seemed like that she was going to fade away into the brink of obscurity until her appearance in The Emoji Movie actually managed to kill her career, and since then, she has appeared in mostly low-scale films for now on.\n\nChristina Aguilera: The polarized reception of The Emoji Movie severely killed her career, and this also happened in the music industry, as she focused more on her social media storylines.\n\nJennifer Coolidge: Although she was popular during the 2000s and 2010s, she appeared less often after Maleficent, and around 2015-2016 she was forgotten about, until she made the enormous mistake appearing in The Emoji Movie, which immediately made her quit acting and serve as a university professor at the Baylor College of Medicine (BCM) from 2017 until 2020, which made her to being kicked out of Maleficent: Mistress of Evil, being replaced by Keira Knightley.\n\nJason Drucker: Had vanished from the industry after the failure of Diary of a Wimpy Kid: The Long Haul, though he did appear in Bumblebee, which was released the following year, it wasn't enough to save his career.\n\nJennifer Lopez: Her career in both the movie and music industry was horribly hit because of the failures of both Home and Ice Age: Collision Course, so she faded back into obscurity ever since.\n\nJuliette Lewis: She vanished from the industry after the failure of the Fantastic Four reboot, not even the failures of Paul Blart: Mall Cop 2 and Jem and the Holograms doesn’t help her either.\n\nAvril Lavigne: Her career was severely hit when Jem and the Holograms became a flop at the box office, and then she was sidelined out of the film industry ever since, as she focused more on being in the music industry.\n\nJake Abel: His career was severely hit due to the failure of After Earth, and he has been sidelined from the industry because of this.\n\nJoe Pantoliano: After the failure of Percy Jackson and The Olympians: The Lightning Thief and Marmaduke, he has been sidelined from the industry completely by 2011.\n\nAlexandra Daddario: She was unheard after the brutal failure of Annie, but however, she’s starting to show some resurgence over the years with Gunpowder Milkshake, In the Heights, and Barbie, so there might be a possible chance her career could be revived.\n\nVin Diesel: Was forgotten once the Fast and Furious franchise ended in 2023.\n\nTyrese Gibson: Was forgotten once the Fast and Furious franchise ended in 2023.\n\nChris “Ludacris” Bridges: Was sidelined after appearing in Show Dogs, which ended up damaging his career big time.\n\nSung Kang: Was forgotten once the Fast and Furious franchise ended in 2023.\n\nJordana Brewster: Was forgotten once the Fast and Furious franchise ended in 2023.\n\nAmber Heard: Thanks to her arrogant nature after she abused and framed Johnny Depp, she was thankfully sidelined out of the industry.\n\nAshton Kutcher: Although he was a popular comedic actor during the 2000s and the 2010s, the combined failures of Cowboys & Aliens and Spy Kids: All the Time in the World seemed to be career-killing movies for him, but he thankfully did appear in The Lost City.

Because of this, all his Urban Jungle roles that he was going to voice had to get scrapped and Seth MacFarlane, Patrick Warburton, Martin Lawrence, Will Arnett, Jason Schwartzman, and James Woods dubbed over all his alternate roles respectively. However, he did get a guest star role in only one episode as Dr. George Antilocapra respectively.\n\nJosh Gad: He was sidelined in the 2010’s, mainly because both Ice Age: Continental Drift and The Angry Birds Movie met mixed reception from critics, but the Frozen franchise, The Angry Birds Movie 2, and Urban Jungle all managed to save his career from further downfall.\n\nStanley Tucci: He was a popular actor in the 1990’s and 2000’s, but he was presumably sidelined in the 2010s, his career was awfully hit after the failures of Space Chimps 2, the live-action TMNT duology, and Show Dogs.\n\nRay Romano: Has rarely been seen after Ice Age: Collision Course, which probably killed his career.\n\nRashida Jones: Although her career wasn’t killed unlike most actors we know today, she has been shown rarely in the 2020s after the critical acclaim of Klaus in 2019, possibly due to the mixed reception of The Grinch and the box office failure of Spies in Disguise.\n\nDenis Leary: Was predominantly sidelined in the 2010’s, mainly because the negative reception of Ice Age: Collision Course managed to kill his career, this resulted with him being kicked out of the cast of The Ice Age Adventures of Buck Wild, being replaced by Skyler Stone respectively.\n\nJesse Tyler Ferguson: After appearing in Sex Tape, Hot Tub Time Machine 2, and Ice Age: Collision Course, he has faded into obscurity.\n\nUtkarsh Ambudkar: Was sidelined in 2022 after the negative failure of The Ice Age Adventures of Buck Wild managed to kill his career.\n\nDanny McBride: Was sidelined in the mid 2010’s after the mixed reception of The Angry Birds Movie and Sausage Party, so audiences decided to care less about him.\n\nCraig Robinson: He has sadly fallen off after the negative reception of Escape from Planet Earth and Sausage Party, which immediately caused him to go on a six-year hiatus from being in an animated movie until The Bad Guys tended to save his career from downfall.\n\nJane Lynch: Her career was terribly hit due to her involvement in Space Chimps 2: Zartog Strikes Back, the Grown Ups duology, Escape from Planet Earth, the live-action TMNT duology, and Ralph Breaks the Internet, and has been sidelined from the industry ever since.\n\nAlec Baldwin: He was a very popular actor in the 2000’s and early 2010’s, but he was indiscriminately sidelined in the late 2010s and early 2020s, his career was negatively impacted after the negative receptions of both Arctic Dogs and The Boss Baby: Family Business, the industry felt like that they mostly care less about him mainly due to his advancing age.\n\nKelly Ripa: She was famous as a talk show host back in the days, but her career was predominantly sidelined in the 2010s, after the negative criticism of both Fly Me to The Moon and Delgo (2008) back in 2008, she mostly relied on being a talk show host instead.\n\nSarah Sliverman: Her career has fell off the wagon after the negative reception of Ralph Breaks the Internet, so audiences decided to care less about her.\n\nBrad Abrell: The box office failure of Hotel Transylvania 4 predominantly killed his career, but he has been seen more commonly when he appeared in Urban Jungle, which recovered his career from further downfall.\n\nMartin Short: Has rarely been seen after the failure of Zoolander 2, which probably killed his career.\n\nFlula Borg: His career fell off the wagon after appearing in Ralph Breaks the Internet in 2018.

Movie, Migration, and Wonka came out in 2023, audiences started to less care about him, causing him to eventually fade away.\n\nKeanu Reeves: He’s most likely going to fall off in the 2030s due to his advancing age.\n\nJeff Foxworthy: Although he was a popular comedic actor during the 2000s and the 2010s, it seems like he’s starting to fade into obscurity by now.\n\nPatrick Warburton: He might fall off during the next decade or so.\n\nDanny Trejo: He might fall off during the next decade or so.\n\nMel Brooks: Will fall off in the 2020s due to his advancing age.\n\nJordan Peele: Even though he's still seen ocassionally, audiences are getting sick of him in the long run, causing him to focus more on his direction instead of his acting.\n\nGary Sinise: He will probably fall off during the next decade or so.\n\nBrad Garrett: Although it remains unlikely now that he is going to join the Disney/Pixar movie Elio in 2025, he is probably going to become unheard during the 2030s as Disney fans are starting to get sick of him in the long run, not even the failure of Ralph Breaks the Internet didn’t help him either.\n\nMore to be added.\n\nMovie Directors That Were Sidelined By The Industry:\n\nJorge Blanco: He was presumably sidelined in the 2010’s after the failure of Planet 51 and there by fourth never directed a single movie ever since.\n\nPhil Johnston: Was presumably sidelined in the 2020’s after he made the mistake of directing Ralph Breaks the Internet.\n\nJennifer Kluska: The polarized failure of Hotel Transylvania 4 killed her career as a director.\n\nFergal Reilly: He was sidelined after the mixed reception of The Angry Birds Movie, in the result of him being kicked out off the 2019 sequel, being replaced by Thurop Van Orman respectively, leaving him nothing more into being a storyboard director and animator of Urban Jungle alongside the other Angry Birds Movie director Clay Kaytis.\n\nJohn C. Donkin: The negative reception of The Ice Age Adventures of Buck Wild managed to kill his career as a director.\n\nSergio Pablos: Known as a Spanish animator, he has been rarely seen in the industry, prominent in the production of Despicable Me, Smallfoot, and Klaus, his new career is nothing but a executive producer and animator of the adult tv show Urban Jungle, as well as the movie franchise and spin off as a whole.\n\nPeter Lepeniotis: The brutal failure of The Nut Job destroyed his chance of being an ongoing director, and immediately went dark after that, not even the negative reception of Gnome Alone couldn’t help his career either.\n\nLino DiSalvo: His career went dark after the brutal failure of Playmobil: The Movie, he hasn’t directed a single movie after that.\n\nCal Brunker: Was sidelined in the 2010’s after the negative reception of Escape from Planet Earth and The Nut Job 2: Nutty by Nature.\n\nJimmy Hayward: He was prominent for directing Horton Hears a Who!, but he has rarely been seen after Free Birds, which killed his career.\n\nHamish Grieve: Hasn't directed a single movie after the box-office failure of Rumble.\n\nMichael Thurmeier: He hasn’t directed a single movie after the polarized reception of Ice Age: Collision Course, his career went dark after Blue Sky Studios met its end in 2021.\n\nTony Leondis: Known as the director for Igor and Lilo & Stitch 2: Stitch Has a Glitch, his directing career went dark after the polarized reception of The Emoji Movie, which quickly damaged his directing career, at least he apologized for making the movie as well and decided not to direct an single movie after that one.\n\nMike Disa: Known as a Disney animator in the 1990’s and early 2000’s, his career went dark after the negative reception of Hoodwinked Too!

Miller, Patrick Stewart, James Corden, and Anna Faris, which left those four actors nothing more into joining Urban Jungle’s cast as Al, Devin Morrison, Cedrec, and Teresa respectively.\n\nIce Age: Collision Course: Ending the official Ice Age franchise on a polarizing note, this movie officially damaged careers as well.\n\nThe Angry Birds Movie: Pretty much sidelined some careers mainly to the mixed reception.\n\nHotel Transylvania 4: Due to the horrible box office failure, it seemed to kill some careers, especially Ninja, who mostly relied on more of his twitch streaming instead.\n\nRalph Breaks the Internet: This movie killed a lot of careers and destroyed the reputation of Walt Disney as well, to the extent where a lot of people come to think this movie was the worst movie made by Disney.\n\nThe Nut Job duology: Similar to The Emoji Movie and Ice Age: Collision Course, these movies was very prominent for killing careers of nearly all the people that were involved in the franchise, especially Brendan Fraser, Maya Rudolph, Jackie Chan, Peter Lepeniotis, Cal Brunker, and Will Arnett, causing all their careers to go downhill.\n\nAnnie: The movie destroyed careers of half of the people that were involved in the movie, especially Jamie Foxx, Jack McBrayer, Will Smith, and Cameron Diaz, but it eventually didn't destroy Patrick Warburton’s career, as he was involved in two other successful movies released in 2014 that saved him from going downhill.\n\nMost Happy Madison Productions movies: These movies were basically responsible for killing Adam Sandler's career and a lot of other actors as well.\n\nEscape from Planet Earth: Another movie that nearly destroyed everyone who was involved in it.\n\nThe Wild: Much like Ralph Breaks the Internet, it severly hurt Kiefer Sutherland’s career and he could not appear in another movie in three years until DreamWorks’s Monsters Vs. Aliens.\n\nMore to be added.\n\nWhy This Excuse Is Sidelined From The Industry (In A Bad Way):\n\nIt's often disrespectful to the actors in the industry. These days, the industry only often seems to care about employing the more popular big names other than the ones who had already been popular or at least beloved before them. The least they could do is that they could alternate between the popular and washed-up ones, giving them a fair balance, which is what they did before the mid-2010s, but since then, it's really only the popular ones now instead of a balance (the washed-up ones nowadays only appear in lower-scale films, or are only sidelined to supporting or even minor roles.\n\nThe thing about this practice is that it knows no age group. Literally any actor could become affected by this regardless of their age or when they become popular. With actors in old age it's at least more justified in the fact that their older and more advanced age can limit their potential, but that's literally why they have stunt doubles for certain scenes. It's even worse with child actors, as they are often treated worse.\n\nRedeeming Qualities:\n\nSometimes actors do justifiably get blacklisted by the industry due to their advancing age, or if they are heinous or controversial people, and actors can even deliberately do this themselves if their political or religious beliefs get in the way of their career, or if they decide to take a break from the industry to take care of their families or focus on sociopolitical activism (to which the industry will realize this and justifiably sideline them).\n\nEven if some actors do fade away, there can still be some who, despite them fading away or falling off, still keep their household name status and still remain popular due to their influence on society, like Morgan Freeman, Denzel Washington, Will Smith, Will Ferrell, Adam Sandler, Jack Black, Owen Wilson, Johnny Depp, Sigourney Weaver, Tom Cruise, and Martin Lawrence.\n\nSee also:"
