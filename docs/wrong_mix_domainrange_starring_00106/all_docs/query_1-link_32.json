        "text": "“Oh I get it! I get it! Ohhh very cute.”\n\nYes friends and readers it is time once again for another epic recasting. And in the spirit of Halloween I thought what is more Halloweeny than ghosts?\n\nAnd if you remember from the first post I’m not saying this movie should be remade, in fact I am hoping it wont be. I mean come on! There is no way in hell you could even try to retell the story of Ghostbusters and come anywhere near CLOSE to the success of, or the audience reaction and staying power of this beloved film that is the classic from 1984.\n\nBut if I had the chance to remake this film this is who I would cast.\n\nPeter Venkman: Paul Rudd\n\nSo this casting was tough. Honestly how can you possibly even try to recast someone as brilliant as Bill Murray? You can’t, so I didn’t even try. My new casting definitely has a different feel from the original cast and being that Venkman is the front man for the group I needed someone who was affable, good looking, and of course has a good sense of comedic timing, (I Love You Man, Role Models, anyone disagree?). Nobody…let me say that again NOBODY could ever replace Bill Murray. But if the world decides to take a HUGE nose dive and tries to remake this movie I would cast this guy as the lead.\n\nEgon Spengler: Neil Patrick Harris\n\nThis one was actually pretty easy. I wanted him to be a little bit older. He is the veteran scientist that has been doing his job for a while. He’s the guy that the other two go to for guidance and Neil Patrick Harris will give this role the same weight that Harold Ramis brought to it. We can buy him as a scientist and he will play beautifully off of Paul and the guy who will play Ray.\n\nRaymond Stantz: Andy Samberg\n\nI know he is a little manic in his comedy but with this cast I needed a guy who is a little manic. Andy will bring some over the top comedy and some quirkiness to the group that a remake will have to have if it has any real chance to stand on its own as a comedy. Besides who doesn’t like Andy Samberg? I also feel that while he can be over the top he can also tone it down for somber moments and with his performance on Brooklyn Nine-Nine I believe that he will be able to pull off the eccentric scientist role, embodied by Dan Aykroyd, and give some fun comedic moments playing off the other two.\n\nDana Barrett: Emily Blunt\n\nSo alright I’m playing a bit of favorites here. She was really good in Edge of Tomorrow and it was a complete 180 from her debut role in The Devil Wears Prada proving that she’s capable of both comedy and action/drama and is able to melt into a role. I think she would make a great successor in light of that to Sigourney Weaver who also did the whole bad ass action girl as Ripley from the Alien franchise and then turned on a dime to do comedy.\n\nLouis Tully: Joe Lo Truglio\n\nThis guy is sooooooo totally Louis Tully. He is the right age and looking back at the way Rick Moranis played this character I can’t think of another comedic actor that can play the somewhat socially awkward, well-meaning but hopelessly clumsy guy better than Joe Truglio. His performance on Brooklyn Nine-Nine is great and I can see him giving a memorable spin on Louis that would stand up to , and compliment the great performance that was given in 1984. That and he has an extensive resume working with Seth Rogan and company in Superbad and Pineapple Express.\n\nWinston Zeddemore: Terry Crews\n\nI always pictured Winston, played by Ernie Hudson as a blue-collar guy who got a job with the Ghostbusters because he was either laid off or he was in search of a better paying job. His line of, “If there’s a steady paycheck in it, I’ll believe anything you say.” Speaks to this as a guy who is looking for a decent job which pays good. He’s not a crusader or a scientist. And to that end Terry Cruz is perfect. He can bring his blue-collar attitude from Everybody Hates Chris but from his Old Spice commercials we know that he can be just as over the top comedic as Andy Samberg when he wants to be. He will also bring “muscle” to the group that will make some of the later scenes in dealing with Walter Peck just a little bit more tense. Terry will add some bite to the character of Winston which I think will be great to see on film.\n\nJanine Melnitz: Stephanie Beatriz\n\nShe is still something of an unknown actress. First first acting credit according to IMDB is in 2009 on The Closer. She has had a pretty full last couple of years. I LOVE her on Brooklyn Nine-Nine. She plays the hard detective that grew up in the ghetto very well. And while most times she wears a constant scowl on her face it makes the few moments when she does smile that much more special. I think she is very attractive with great comedic timing and a flair for drama if need be. This is all that’s needed from Janine, originally played by Annie Potts, and I think that she would fit in great next to Truglio, Samberg, and Crews.\n\nWalter Peck: Ralph Fiennes\n\nSo maybe this is a little too obvious. I mean could you imagine seeing Ralph Fiennes walking into the Ghostbusters’ firehouse and saying he’s from the EPA? Yeah, total bad guy alert. Ralph Fiennes is an amazing actor and he can be very affable and a nice guy too. Walter Peck, originally played by William Atherton, thinks he is doing the right thing by shutting the Ghostbusters down. Fiennes will bring the kind of conviction to the role that few actors could match. He has a great resume and did a phenomenal job in In Bruges. In thinking about who should play Walter Peck I can’t think of another actor who could nail it the way this guy could.\n\nThat’s my new casting for the movie Ghostbusters. Once again I’m not saying this movie should be remade. I just think it would be really fun to get this group together alone in a room and see what kind of comedy comes out. I would love to see all these guys together and see what they come up with. But this is just a fantasy of mine that will never see the light of day.\n\nIt’s nice to dream."
