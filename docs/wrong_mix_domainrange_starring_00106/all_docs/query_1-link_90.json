        "text": "Looking back over m favorite movies, Iâve noticed that in most of them, thereâs a main character whoâs clumsy, goofy-looking, and weirdâ¦ a nerd! I know Iâm something of a nerd myself, so maybe thatâs why I find these characters so appealingâ¦ at any rate, nerds are everywhere in the movies! If youâre not sure what I mean, letâs review these top 7 movie nerdsâ¦\n\nSnapshot Survey\n\nThanks for sharing your thoughts!\n\nPlease subscribe for your personalized newsletter:\n\nEmail address\n\n1\n\nGeorge McFly from âBack to the Futureâ\n\nCrispin Glover plays George McFly, and 1950âs era nerd with a heart of gold and a sweetness about him thatâs just adorable. Heâs crazy about a girl who doesnât even know he exists, but with a little help from a guy from the future, who just happens to be his son, heâs able to stand up for himself, punch a bully in the face, and win the girlâ¦ in fact, by the end of the movie, heâs actually kind ofâ¦ cuteâ¦\n\n2\n\nMcLovinâ from âSuper Badâ\n\nYou know youâre a nerd when your friends, who are also nerds, single you out for abuse. The problem with McLovinâ is that he doesnât seem to realize that heâs a nerd, or that his friends are being mean to him. Luckily, his friends actually do care about him, and the movie is hilarious, not mean-spirted.\n\n3\n\nPee Wee Herman in âPee Weeâs Big Adventureâ\n\nThis is one of my favorite movies of all time, made especially heart-warming and hilarious by the clueless nerd, Pee Wee. Heâs on a quest to find his most prized possession â his bike â stolen from him by his arch-nemesis, another nerd named Francis.\n\n4\n\nThe Entire Cast of âGooniesâ\n\nA goonie is, by definition, a nerd, and the cast of âGooniesâ represents each kind of them. Thereâs the braces-wearing short kid, the nerdy girl with glasses, the Asian inventor kid, the fat kid, and more. But theyâre all wonderful, and they work together to find the treasure that will save their neighborhood, the Goondox.\n\n5\n\nTed from âSixteen Candlesâ\n\nLooking at Anthony Michael Hall now, itâs hard to believe he was the awkward, goofy-looking kid with the braces and the squeaky voice in John Hughesâ classic âSixteen Candles.â The twist is that as Ted, heâs the hero of all the other nerds. He somehow manages to convince them all that heâs desired by all the girls, including the prom queen. Wow. And hey, look at a young and nerdy John Cusack, too!\n\n6\n\nAny Role Ever Played by Rick Moranis\n\nAny movie role ever played by Rick Moranis has him cast as the nerd. From the âGhostbustersâ movies, to the âHoney, I Shrunk the Kidsâ movies to âMy Blue Heavenâ with Steve Martin, Moranis has been type-cast as a nerd, a role he seems to relish.\n\n7\n\nPeter Parker in âSpidermanâ\n\nWhen I heard Tobey Maguire was going to play Peter Parker in the Spiderman movies, I was shocked. Heâs not a nerd! But he played the role perfectly, especially in the first movie. Heâs awkward, gawky, and clumsy before he gets his spider-powers. A perfect nerd!\n\nThose are my own favorite movie nerds, but there are so many more! Which of these movie nerds do you like best, or is there another one you love more? Please let me know!\n\nEmail address"
