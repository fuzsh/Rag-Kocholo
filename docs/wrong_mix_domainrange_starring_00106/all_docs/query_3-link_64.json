        "text": "The best of all of that eraâ€™s comedies, and one of the funniest teen movies ever\" (25th anniversary)\n\nFull Review | Original Score: 4.5/5 | Aug 26, 2022\n\nThe oftentimes outrageous dialogue and vulgar exchanges between stars Michael Cera and Jonah Hill are both wildly hilarious and genuinely portrayed.\n\nFull Review | Original Score: 8/10 | Nov 28, 2020\n\nAn intelligent and occasionally insightful look at the sometimes scary place we call the adolescent male mind.\n\nFull Review | Original Score: 3.0/4.0 | Sep 24, 2020\n\nThere are enough laughs to make it worth your time. It may not be super good, but it is good enough.\n\nFull Review | Nov 21, 2019\n\nYes, Superbad is a boy's story, so a certain perspective should be expected, and it's not the cheerful filth that bothers me, nor even the conventional morality; it's the paternalism.\n\nFull Review | Aug 23, 2017\n\nSuperbad is a movie about partying and getting wasted and getting the girl, but as the night wears on, much wisdom is gained too, about self, friendship and the end of teenage innocence in all its wondrous, terrifying splendor.\n\nFull Review | Aug 3, 2013\n\nBeneath the swearing and the tampon jokes lies a sweet-hearted tale of three chums celebrating the end of their carefree high-school days.\n\nFull Review | Original Score: 3/4 | Aug 3, 2013\n\nIt's a simple tale about two horny kids not only on a quest for vodka, beer and sticky fumbling, but they're looking to find themselves in the process. I'll be damned if there's many people left in the cinema afterwards who won't relate to that.\n\nFull Review | Original Score: 4/5 | Nov 3, 2012\n\nWhat makes the film so appealing is the disconnect between what comes from the mouths of these hormone-addled pups and what's going on in their heads, where they're still clinging desperately to the innocence they're leaving behind.\n\nFull Review | Oct 18, 2008\n\n[Cera] has some of the best comic timing of anyone working in film today, a precocious sense of the awkward pauses and misread cues in which social panic resides.\n\nFull Review | Sep 22, 2008\n\nThe comic-duo of Jonah Hill and Michael Cera reminded me of an immature, foul-mouthed Laurel & Hardy.\n\nFull Review | Original Score: 8/10 | Sep 4, 2008\n\neven if Superbad's not much more than a teen comedy, it's the best teen comedy to come out in at least a decade. There's no shame in that.\n\nFull Review | Jul 31, 2008"
