        "text": "Directed by Frank Oz, the movie musical premiered in 1986, starring Moranis and original stage star Ellen Greene as Audrey. \"Little Shop of Horrors\" was based on the Off-Broadway musical of the same name that opened in 1982. The musical, starring Greene and Lee Wilkof, ran for five years, closing Nov. 1, 1987.\n\nLittle Shop of Horrors, by composer Alan Menken and late lyricist-librettist Howard Ashman, features music in the style of early 1960s rock-and-roll and doo-wop as well as more traditional Broadway ballads like \"Somewhere That's Green.\" A 2003 Broadway production starred Hunter Foster and Kerry Butler.\n\nClick here to see Playbill.com's collection of videos from Little Shop of Horrors.\n\nThe musical was based on the 1960 black comedy film \"The Little Shop of Horrors,\" directed by Roger Corman. The film followed a down-on-his luck florist named Seymour who encounters a new species of plant that feeds on human flesh and lures him into a world of fame, greed and murder."
