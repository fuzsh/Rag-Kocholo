It went through several revisions and writing teams over a period of about 25 years. It was not greenlit and instead a reboot Ghostbusters movie became the focus starting in Fall 2014.[1] Sony confirmed through Twitter as well.[2] Work continued on a possible third film script; but a script by Jason Reitman and Gil Kenan was greenlit instead, and Ghostbusters: Afterlife was released on November 19, 2021.\n\nRead Here Before Editing this Page\n\nBecause of the nature of this page, only administrators can edit currently.

In early 2009, Judd Apatow reportedly signed on to produce.[6][7]\n\nIn February 2009, Dan Aykroyd revealed \"the script is commenced early summer in June. Hope to be in production by late fall 2009\".[8][9]\n\nOn March 3, 2009, Sony debunked Judd Apatow's involvement in the movie. Claims of a production listing with him credited as a producer were concluded to be faked.[10]\n\nBy October 16, 2010, Aykroyd was doing a pass on the script. He had Eliza Dushku, Anna Faris, and Bill Hader in mind for the cast but Sony would not greenlight it without Murray.[11]\n\nAround 2009-2010, Rick Moranis was approached by an associate of Akyroyd and asked if he would work on a third movie.[12] In total, Ivan Reitman, Dan Aykroyd and Harold Ramis helped them with the script.[13] There were three completely drafts written over a period of 4-5 years. [14]\n\nOn February 18, 2009, Aykroyd stated the script was still being worked on and that they \"hope to be in production by late fall 2009\".[15]\n\nAs of June 19, 2009 and later September 30th, 2009, Harold Ramis confirmed the movie is not in production, and there's still no clue who is going to play the new Ghostbusters; however he also confirmed all four actors that played the original Ghostbusters have agreed to be part of the new project. Sony is also very interested in it. [16][17]\n\nIn an interview with IGN regarding 2009's Ghostbusters: The Video Game, Dan Aykroyd mentioned that he thinks the game will be touched upon in the new movie. Primarily expanding on the notion in the game that they need new rookies and that the writers for the new movie have been playing and following the development of the game. And he expects the writers will draw off some elements from it. He sites at the time of the interview that the first draft of the third movies script is currently in the works.[18]\n\nOn December 28, 2009, Ramis stated the plan was progressing shoot next summer and release in 2011.[19]\n\nIn an interview with Breakfast Television Vancouver on September 23, 2010, Dan Aykroyd said the following: [20]\n\nHope to be in business in Spring (2011)\n\nThe hold up was not Bill Murray, it was a matter of our schedules being open\n\nWe need younger people to carry the packs and drive the Cadillac\n\nMentions Ray Stantz has issues with his eye, knee, and hip as well as fitting into the jumpsuit.\n\nIt's about passing the torch to a younger and stronger generation\n\nThere will be a stronger threat, especially since we're coming out the Kali Yuga [21] into a post-2012 apocalyptic cataclysm\n\nWhen asked about casting, Aykroyd answered he has people in mind\n\nThey want a young woman in her early 20s and three young men in their early 20s\n\nOn August 25, 2011, during an interview with Dennis Miller Radio, Dan Aykroyd stated he hopes to go into production in Spring (2012).[22]\n\nOn November 13, 2011, during an interview with Michelle Miller on CBS Sunday Morning to promote his Crystal Head Vodka, Dan Aykroyd stated the script is being refined.[23] [24]\n\nOn December 4, 2012, Dan Aykroyd confirmed he and Ivan Reitman have worked on every draft in the past three years. [25]\n\nOn April 23, 2013, for the second draft, Dan Aykroyd revealed he completely rewrote the script and included the part he wrote for Bill Murray.[26] The screen play was very Bill Murray-centric but Ivan Reitman recalled during a conversation with Murray during a Toronto Film Festival that Murray was into small roles and was no longer interested in leading roles.[27]\n\nOn January 16, 2020, in an interview, Lee Eisenberg confirmed he and Stupnitsky worked on Ghostbusters for four years and at one point, the movie was greenlit but contingent on Bill Murray doing it.[28]\n\nCohen Rewrite\n\nOn June 6, 2012, during interview on The Late Show with David Letterman, Bill Murray commented, \"It's got to be really funny and that first one was so darn funny, it's hard for me... I think we'll try again. I always drag my feet on it, but I think...\" [29]\n\nOn June 30, 2012, Dan Aykroyd mentioned, \"new writing staff working on it [the script] now... it's got to be perfect. That's the whole thing. There's no point in doing it unless it's perfect.\" [30]\n\nOn July 10, 2012, it was revealed Etan Cohen has been hired to rewrite the script. [31]\n\nOn September 10, 2012, while at the Toronto Film Festival, Bill Murray commented, \"We'll see. There's another script in process. We'll see if it's good. It's got to be really good y'know because the first one was so great.\" [32]\n\nOn September 22, 2012, at a Crystal Head Vodka signing event in Ottawa, Ontario, Dan Aykroyd revealed he has seen some pages of the new script and did a few changes. He also hinted filming might be done in Canada and when the time comes he would call on the fan community to come to the sets. [33]\n\nOn December 4, 2012, Dan Aykroyd revealed Ivan Reitman has been strongly collaborating with Etan Cohen. Aykroyd also worked on revisions when needed. [34]\n\nBy December 30 2012, in the first draft, Peter was not in the story. The omission was Akyroyd's request but Sony was hesitant about it.[35]\n\nOn March 5, 2013, Dan Aykroyd revealed he's was going to look at some pages of the script by Cohen in the next couple of weeks. Aykroyd reiterated Bill Murray has shown interest in reading a script and there will always be a place for him in the movie. [36]\n\nOn April 12, 2013, Dan Aykroyd said \"we've got sixty pages\" and then went on to confirm once more that Ivan Reitman is on board with the third movie. [37]\n\nOn April 23, 2013, Dan Aykroyd revealed half of the screenplay is be completed very soon. Aykroyd thinks the movie should be in production by the fall and be shooting by the new year. [38] On May 13, 2013, Dan Aykroyd revealed he would be meeting with Ivan Reitman on June 7 in Cleveland to discuss the script. [39]\n\nIn January 2014, after several drafts, the new Ghostbusters team consisted of: Chris, a kindhearted scholar; Jeremy, Chris's cynical friend who loves debunking ghost stories; Dean, the son of Ray Stantz who now licensed the Ghostbusters name to a theme restaurant; and Anna, who has a romance with Chris that stalls because she doesn't like to date coworkers. The main villain was Gniewko and the recurring threat were \"hellions\" controlling people and animals. Ray Stantz and Egon Spengler had cameos as ghosts. Dana Barrett, Louis Tully and his wife, the Stay Puft Marshmallow Man, and Peter Venkman had brief appearances. The ending battle featured a giant baby.[40] Doug Belgrad, president of Sony Pictures, and Amy Pascal wanted to forward the Alive Again script to Seth Rogen and Evan Goldberg, believing they would be the game changers the movie needed. Belgrad also thought Rogen would have been perfect for the role of Chris. Adam Pally, Charlie Day, and Jesse Eisenberg were considered for Chris by Ivan Reitman. Jonah Hill was offered Jeremy. Emma Stone was offered Anna. Brie Larson and Anne Hathaway were Reitman's choices for Anna. He met with both and they were both interested. Zach Galifianakis was his choice for Dean, Rebel Wilson, Aubrey Plaza, and Aziz Ansari for other roles, and Sacha Baron Cohen for Gniewko. Pascal wanted Will Ferrell for Gniewko but Reitman didn't think he could play the role seriously.[41] The directors known to have passed on it were Phil Lord and Chris Miller, Paul Feig, and Todd Phillips. Discussions with Brad Bird went nowhere. Judd Apatow, Adam McKay, Jay Roach, Matt Stone and Trey Parker, and Seth McFarlane were on Amy Pascal's list. Ruben Fleischer and Nick Stoller were \"maybes\" and Jason Bateman was considered. Like Fleischer, another director who emailed Pascal to express interest was Dominique Adams.[42][43]\n\nOn March 18, 2014, it was reported Ivan Reitman decided to only return as a Producer in light of the passing of Harold Ramis in February. Reitman said he will work with Sony Pictures Entertainment executive Amy Pascal to find a director for the movie from a short list they are already working on. After they find the director, they will look for the new cast. Reitman hopes to start production in Fall 2014 in New York but felt the beginning of 2015 is more likely. [44] [45]\n\nOn April 4, 2014 - The Wrap published an article with a 5:57 video [46] The majority of the video is fancast but Jeff Scneider claims they have an agency breakdown of the main roles:\n\nTwo are young men who will be aged 23-29\n\nJeremy is the young leader.\n\nChris is the son of Peter Venkman.\n\nFemale lead is Anna and she has a doctorate. Will be a few years older.\n\nOlder male named Eean who will likely serve as the film's comic relief.\n\nThe villain named Eniewko.\n\nOn April 7, 2014, it was reported Phil Lord and Chris Miller turned down an offer to direct the movie. [47]\n\nOn April 8, 2014, Ivan Reitman noted, \"A lot of directors are throwing their hats in. We're starting the meetings. We're going to do it.\" [48]\n\nOn May 30, 2014, Ruben Fleischer was reported to be considered as the director. [49]\n\nOn June 4, 2014, in an article celebrating 30 years of Ghostbusters, a studio spokesman speaking for Columbia Pictures president Doug Belgrad stated, \"We are currently working hard to re-create the magic of the original in order to bring a new Ghostbusters adventure to life\" in response to a Ghostbusters III inquiry. [50]\n\nOn July 21, 2014, on the Today show, Dan Aykroyd commented the movie is looking to be in pre-production in spring 2015. [51]\n\nOn June 4, 2014, in an article celebrating 30 years of Ghostbusters, snippets of a phone interview with Etan Cohen was included. Cohen confirmed he and Ivan Reitman are \"together for hours every week, working on it [the script] really closely\" and reaffirmed that Dan Aykroyd is acting as an 'overseeing Ghostbusters writer emeritus.' [52]\n\nOn September 1, 2014, Ivan Reitman confirmed the drafts that he supervised always had a very important female presence. [53]\n\nIn the featurette \"Time Is A But A Window: Ghostbusters II and Beyond\" from the September 16, 2014 release Ghostbusters 1 & 2 Gift Set (2014), Dan Aykroyd clarified he had written two \"really solid\" third movie scripts and a third concept, that Sony signed off on, with the late Harold Ramis. While working on the third concept, Aykroyd admitted he hears Ramis' sensibility and often edits his work with a 'What would Harold do?' He reaffirmed hope that the third movie would deal with passing the torch to a new generation. [54]\n\nOn February 18, 2015, Dan Aykroyd, while on Unmasked with Ron Bennington on Sirius XM, stated the three drafts of Ghostbusters III were going to be partly salvaged and used. He hoped the Feig reboot would reinvigorate the franchise and help get a \" a more conventional third sequel\" and \"another idea\" made. [55]\n\nOn May 31, 2015, Paul Feig confirmed he was approached to direct Ghostbusters III several times but turned it down because he couldn't figure out how to do it and wasn't excited about it. [56]\n\nOn June 8, 2016, Ivan Reitman, on KROQ, talked a little about the timeline of Ghostbusters III. About four to five years ago (2011-2012), another attempt to make Ghostbusters III started. A couple of scripts were done. Reitman was going to direct it. Sony immediately greenlit one of the scripts. The script was about passing the torch. At some point in the first 20 pages, Peter Venkman died. Harold Ramis because really sick then passed away in 2014. Reitman didn't think they could pull off a Ghostbusters III without Ramis. At that time, they began to listen to pitches from other directors, including Paul Feig who pitched retelling the movie with an all women team. Reitman wasn't sure if he agreed with it but felt it was a fresh idea. Reitman noted most of the male actors were too frightened to step in the footsteps of the four original Ghostbusters. [57] [58]\n\nPlot\n\nLittle of the plot is known. What is known is it will include old and new Ghostbusters. Numerous Ghostbusters cadets would be involved.\n\nHarold Ramis: \"I think we are just going to try and make a good movie. The intention of a sequel is not to give an audience more of what they didn't get enough of the first time. It's to give the audience something that is new. We want them to feel that they are having a new experience of some kind. That becomes a tightrope. Yeah, we definitely are introducing new Ghostbusters. That much is for sure. And there will be inter-dimensional creatures visiting New York. And we will deal with it. That's all I am allowed to say at this point.\" [59]\n\nFor awhile, the concept was the Ghostbusters cleaned up New York City of all ghosts and went out out business. The concept then shifted to passing the torch to new Ghostbusters.[60]\n\nAt some point in the first 20 pages of at least one of the Eisenberg-Stupnitsky scripts, Peter Venkman died.[61][62] It was the passing of the torch from the original Ghostbusters to a new group led by Dana's son Oscar. Peter's ghost is a very major character. [63] In the most recent draft, Oscar was a postgrad student, weird things start to happen, and Peter dies in the first scene and becomes a ghost. Overall, it was a father-son story.[64]\n\nThe new team would be Columbia University students studying and researching particle physics.[65] The Higgs boson, gluons, and mesons from particle theory will provide a scientific base in terms of the storytelling, \"to open up to another dimension and have something horrible come through.\" [66] Modern day anti-matter research and CERN may be a \"breeding ground for the paranormal.\"[67] The dimension Earth resides in, the four planes of existence, length, height, width, and time, become threatened by some of this research being done. Four new Ghostbusters have to solve the problem. Larry King would have a part in the movie talking about paranormal incidents in parts of Manhattan, including Morningside Heights.[68] [69]\n\nThe new Ghostbusters would learn how how to use a variety of devices including the 'psychotron and the accelerators' and new stuff such as 'the neuron splitter,' which is going to be the interplaner, and an 'interceptor' -- which would allow them to go from dimension to dimension.[70]\n\nThe original Ghostbusters are in a very minor role.[71] The story is focused \"more about new people.\"[72] On March 31, 2014, Ivan Reitman was quoted confirming Ghostbusters III is not a reboot. The story would just focus on new Ghostbusting characters while in contrast, the late Harold Ramis would have had a cameo.[73] Egon was working at the International Institute for Imaginary Science in Geneva. \"He's evolved a post-rational, non-conclusive logic for dealing with problems of chaos\" but he's \"gone so abstract, even he doesn’t know what he’s doing.\"[citation needed][74]\n\nTristan Jones worked on previsualization.[75] [76] [77] In a ghost montage scene, Jones drew an entity called the \"Meat Bull\" Ghost. It originated from a mounted skull on the wall of a steak joint that came to life. The idea was all the meat and Ectoplasm was used to create its body.[78] [79]\n\nIn all the scripts read by Paul Feig, the core of the story was a new team comes together, the original team was forgotten, they give the equipment to the new team and train them.[80]\n\nThe ending would organically feed into a fourth movie. The fifth or sixth would involve the Man-Hell-ttan concept from the Hellbent script.[81]\n\nCrew\n\nScript Writers\n\nEtan Cohen\n\nPreviously Confirmed (July 10, 2012)[82]\n\nLee Eisenberg & Gene Stupnitsky\n\nPreviously Confirmed[83] [84][85] [86], now they are apparently off the project[87]\n\nDirector\n\nIvan Reitman\n\nStepped down\n\nProducer\n\nIvan Reitman as producer only\n\nConfirmed [88]\n\nPreviously reported to be director.[89][90] Will only produce now.\n\nCast\n\nActors\n\nBill Murray as Peter Venkman\n\nUnconfirmed; has yet to sign on\n\nDan Aykroyd as Ray Stantz\n\nConfirmed[91][92] [93][94]\n\nHarold Ramis as Egon Spengler\n\nPassed away on February 24, 2014\n\nPreviously confirmed[95][96]\n\nErnie Hudson as Winston Zeddemore\n\nConfirmed[97][98]\n\nAnnie Potts as Janine Melnitz\n\nPossible\n\nSigourney Weaver as Dana Barrett\n\nConfirmed[99]\n\nOscar\n\nSlightly Possible[100]\n\nRick Moranis as Louis Tully\n\nNot Confirmed\n\nSee Also\n\nGhostbusters III: Hellbent\n\nGhostbusters: Afterlife\n\nOther Pitches\n\nThe Strange True Story of Max Landis' Ghostbusters 3\n\nTrivia\n\nIn the Crew and Filmmakers section of special features in the 1998 Collector's Edition DVD of The Blues Brothers, Dan Aykroyd's filmography section lists Ghostbusters III as a 1998 release.\n\nThe script for Ghostbusters: The Video Game was not based on any drafts of the third movie.[101][102] Internally, the Terminal Reality development team wanted the game to be Ghostbusters III. Aykroyd and Ramis considered it to be the third film. There was a logo made. Sony Pictures wouldn't allow it. At the time, they didn't want that tied to a game.[103]\n\nAround 2010, Rhett Reese and Paul Wernick wrote a draft of Zombieland 2 that had a scene that took place on a golf course where Bill Murray was playing golf with Dan Aykroyd, Ernie Hudson, and Harold Ramis. Aykroyd, Ramis, and Hudson were trying to convince Murray to be in Ghostbusters III and he was reluctant. Murray was already annoyed because the group ahead of them were playing slowly and it turned out Joe Pesci was in that group. Murray hits the drive towards Joe Pesci and gets him mad.[104]\n\nReferences\n\nNot Usable Citations\n\nSince this page is about a possible event, that also means that some articles cited at one point will become useless due to changes of points of view or events.
