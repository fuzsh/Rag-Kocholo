        "text": "Coming-of-age films often target a teenage audience and portray the feeling of growing up and moving onto the next part of one’s life. The audience thinks about their own experiences in relation to the characters and may learn valuable lessons through the film. When comparing Superbad, a film written and directed by men, to Booksmart, a film written and directed by women, there are notable differences. The differences are found in the language, portrayal of women, and the characters’ main objectives for their actions.\n\nSuperbad is a film that focuses solely on a group of high school boys coming of age. It was written by two men, Seth Rogen and Evan Goldberg. The pair began writing the film while they were still teenagers; they “loosely based [it] on their own experiences of trying to buy booze and pick up girls” (CBC News/Radio Canada, 2007). The director, Gregg Mottola, is also a man and employs the male gaze repeatedly with down-blouse shots and close ups on women’s butts. Superbad caters to the male gaze and offers a look at what it means to come of age in a heteronormative environment that equates sexual experience with worth.\n\nBooksmart is a 2019 coming-of-age film that was directed by Olivia Wilde and solely written by women, some of which include Emily Halpern and Sarah Haskins. The two female protagonists, Amy and Molly, have spent their whole high school careers being overachievers. On the last night of high school, they choose to experience all the fun that they skipped out on. Throughout the film, they learn lessons and grow their friendship. Booksmart does an amazing job at portraying women. The female characters are complex versus the typical female in Superbad. This can be attributed to the director and writers. As stated by Callahan et al. (2010), having female directors and writers allows female representation to be more diverse and does not follow masculine expectations. The females behind the big screen stray away from objectification and the male gaze. They instead give teenage girls who watch the film insight into self-discovery and the importance of having fun for yourself.\n\nThe Gaze\n\nAs Seth picks up Evan on his way to school, viewers are put into Seth’s perspective as the camera purposefully lingers on Evan’s mom’s exposed skin. When they drive away, Seth then teases Evan about his mom’s low-cut shirt. As this movie was written by men, directed by a man, and coming from two male character’s perspectives, the audience is subjected to the male gaze and the camera unsurprisingly lingers on women’s bodies. Laura Mulvey (1975) argues that women are seen as “passive raw material for the active gaze of man” in order to “induce voyeuristic or fetishistic mechanisms to circumvent her threat” of taking away a man’s power (p. 67). Superbad demonstrates Mulvey’s theory as the women in the film are often gawked at by the male characters and the camera.\n\nThis image is from a scene in Booksmart. The shot is from the point of view of Amy. The girl in the image is her crush, Ryan. While looking at Ryan, Amy is trying to find the courage to go speak to her. The gaze in this scene is similar to what we have seen in class in Portrait of a Lady on Fire, but is more of a modern take. The girls in Booksmart offer a perspective that is based on emotion and love, as seen in the characters in Portrait of a Lady on Fire. Through the female gaze, Ryan is not objectified, but rather looked at in a more innocent way. This is different from the gaze in Superbad, which shows women as objects of desire through fixation on their bodies and small clothing. The female gaze is also open to homosexual relationships, something that is not seen with the male gaze. The male gaze paints lesbian relationships as overly sexual and gay relationships as “not masculine.” The relationship that Amy has with Ryan is not one that is hypersexualized.\n\nCharacters’ Objectives\n\nIn this crucial scene that sets up the entire rest of the story, Seth rushes over to Evan to tell him that Jules invited him to her party by asking him to get them all alcohol. Seth takes this invite as a hint that what Jules is really saying is that she wants to have sex with him. His logic is that she will be drunk, and he is providing the alcohol, and so he will be by her side during the party and hopefully be one of her drunken mistakes. Seth’s entire objective is to have sex before he leaves for college. But when we look at the characters from Booksmart, we see that their objective is to finally let loose and attend social events since they spent their whole high school careers strictly studying. Mark Cohan (2009) discusses an early 2000’s research study about young men and whether their confidence is linked to the status of them being a virgin or not. The study concludes that “many boys report being part or being aware of male peer groups in which a core membership credential is losing one’s virginity. Being a virgin does not mean a boy is excluded from membership, but it does place him in kind of a junior status” (p. 162). Seth’s main focus the entire plot of the movie is to lose his virginity before he goes off to college so he can be seen as the cool, mature, experienced guy.\n\nIn this scene of Booksmart, the female protagonist Amy is trying to convince her best friend and other female lead of the movie, Molly, that they do not need to go out to a party to prove they are fun. The scene offers a backstory to the kind of characters Molly and Amy are. They did not go out to parties in high school because they chose to focus on school and get into exceptional colleges. However, Molly finds out that the others who went out to party also got into good colleges. This is why Molly wishes to attend the last big party of the school year. She feels that they should have let loose and have fun when they had the chance. Amy tries to explain that they are cool by saying “we have fake IDs” to which Molly responds “yeah fake college IDs so we can get into their 24-hour library.” This shows that their focus has always been on academics, something that is not seen in the film Superbad. The main objective of Amy and Molly is to have fun for themselves and involves moments of self-discovery, whereas in Superbad, their objective is to have sex, party, and do drugs. Along the way, Amy and Molly learn the importance of getting out of your comfort zone and how you should get to know someone before judging them. The film offers lessons for the audience, whereas Superbad is a film that is solely for comedic purposes.\n\nLGBTQ Representation\n\nSuperbad frequently uses language that is discriminatory towards the LGBTQ community. Throughout the film, the word “gay” is used as a negative descriptor and the F-slur is used both explicitly and as a pun on McLovin’s real name “Fogell”. Superbad as a film has no LGBTQ representation. The characters fixate on their goal of achieving their ideal of manhood and being in line with hegemonic masculinity. The characters are in a homophobic environment, having a highly heteronormative view of what achieving manhood and presenting masculinely is; therefore, they view homosexuality as the antithesis to their goals and use it as an ultimate insult.\n\nThis scene from Booksmart provides the audience with LGBTQIA+ representation as the audience is exposed to Amy’s crush on Ryan. In this scene, Amy expresses her concerns that Ryan might not be into girls, but her best friend Molly wittingly interjects by stating that Ryan ”wore a polo shirt to prom.” Amy defends her initial concern by attempting to explain the difference between gender performance and sexual orientation. Overall, this scene does an excellent job at subverting emphasized femininity as Amy’s character is lesbian and Ryan is portrayed as not being traditionally feminine. The movie incorporates this representation in a very normal and natural way which helps universalize non-traditional gender performativity and different sexual orientations and treat their existence in a similar manner to the heterosexuality and cisgender people.\n\nReferences\n\nCallahan, V., Shore, A., Everett, A., Kuhn, A., Saito, A., Sellier, G., Muscio, G., Staiger, J., Hershfield, J., Mulvey, L., Schreiber, M., White, P., Flitterman-Lewis, S., Stamp, S., Kim, S., Higashi, S., Leonard, S., Francis, T.
