The logo for streamer[...]\n\nOther titles leaving Netflix include the Underworld films, Cult of Chucky (before Halloween!), The Neverending Story, Sleepless in Seattle, Spaceballs, Ace Ventura, The Silence of the Lambs, and so many more Lots more films than shows this go around, but none of the absences will be felt like Parks and Rec I guess it might[...]\n\nThanks to @chriscandy4u and @therealjencandy.

Freddy Krueger burst on the scene in 1984 and the Nightmare on Elm[...]\n\nEver. The Canadian left showbiz back in 1997 to focus on his family, an admirable endeavor to be sure. Moranis was a mainstay of comedy for much of the '80s and early '90s, his dual roles in Ghostbusters touchstones of the genre, as well as the classic Mel Brooks Star Wars parody comedy Spaceballs. Therein lies why he's coming out[...]\n\nA new year means a new influx of viewing options from your friendly neighborhood streaming service, as Hulu readies members for films and programs that range from culinary (Beat Bobby Flay, Cutthroat Kitchen) and karate (The Karate Kid) to bad men (Reservoir Dogs) and \"bad\" jokes (Spaceballs).
