        "text": "No, it‚Äôs a Mont Blanc.\n\nEnemy of the State is a delightful romp. Where the plot suffers, a sweaty Tom Sizemore rescues, or Will Smith charges through on pure charisma, or Gene Hackman shouts at someone, or Lisa Bonet moves her hair around.\n\nIf you love this film, and want to love it even more, watch the Conversation.\n\nSome of Ebert‚Äôs cynicism or fatigue with films is on display in his review and especially in his comparison with the Conversation. Nevertheless, he is spot on here, ‚Äúthe standoff at the end edges perilously close to the ridiculous.‚Äù Perhaps my born-in-cynicism makes me a larger fan than Ebert.\n\nSeth Green is the NSA agent who leads the bugging job on Will Smith. Where they replace his watch, pen, belt buckle, shoes, and I can‚Äôt remember what else. Smith dresses immaculately, and this includes a Mont Blanc. In a classic (for my purposes), negating-proof of my theory, Green answers the rookie NSA agent, ‚ÄúIs that a Parker Pen?‚Äù ‚ÄúNo. It‚Äôs a Mont Blanc.‚Äù Regina King could have one, the congressman, but easiest would be Hackman. But there isn‚Äôt one featured because no one is truly good, or innocent or even trying to be. Which is thy the line is iconic. At least for such niche purposes as this website. (And my cc disagrees with my memory on what is said in the van, you can adjudicate at your leisure).\n\nMy 14 year old (now 17) and I have been rewatching films that are dear to me and (hopefully) interesting to her. The growth in John Hughes from 16 Candles (which did not hold up well‚Ä¶ or perhaps at all) to the Breakfast Club and then Ferris Bueller was incredibly fun and gave us a lot to talk about. Her favorite lines are, ‚ÄúPardon my French, but you‚Äôre an asshole! Asshole!‚Äù And, ‚ÄúScrews fall out all the time, the world is an imperfect place.‚Äù This growth was not linear, he filmed Breakfast Club and Ferris at the same time, but you see incredible development in the films.\n\nBreakfast Club has (even if you include the parents ‚Äì one of the only times we see John Hughes. And his wife). It is a lonely movie, set in a large school and the pace of the movie is so Saturday. You would not see Carl during a regular session in the library on a Tuesday, he and the principal drinking Schlitz beers as Carl extorts him? Not a Thursday occurrence at Shermer High (https://thebreakfastclub.fandom.com/wiki/Shermer_High_School). As many have remarked, the movie is a play ‚Äì done exceptionally well.\n\nWhat do we know about the jotter from other films? It has many purposes, but primarily it displays an easy-to-overlook dignity. The hero rarely, if ever, has a jotter because you know her or him immediately. When the hero does have a jotter that means that the culture of the film and the story are so horrific that their nobility must be even more obvious than usual (examples: Se7en and Zodiac). The pen in Breakfast Club finds its way into an unlikely benevolent accomplice ‚Äî Carl.\n\nEnter the master of Shermer‚Äôs custodial arts. Perhaps you like Carl, especially when he calls out Principal Vernon for reading files labeled confidential. At least, you like him if you‚Äôre on the kid‚Äôs side and understand the movements of the film. Carl is the only character who, literally, gets the best of every other character in the film. Bender and Allison don‚Äôt like him for exactly one minute, until he leaves with the spectacular nod to the students, ‚Äúby the way, that clock is 20 minutes slow‚Äù.\n\nBender tries to mock him, alongside Brian ignoring his obvious friendship with Carl. Andrew and Claire are trying to be cooler than the moment, but if Carl doesn‚Äôt get the better of Bender on balance of their little fight, he wins them all over with the clock reference. And I might add, Bender gave up fighting with Carl ‚Äî who else does this happen with? Who else gets the last word with John Bender?\n\nVernon tries both to dodge Carl‚Äôs wisdom about the kids and the illegal file-reading Vernon is doing out of boredom and general malice. A question for another writer is, who is the true terrorist of the film ‚Äì Vernon or John? We don‚Äôt know if he successfully blackmails Vernon for the 50 bucks. We do see them sharing beers later without Vernon realizing the janitor is wiser towards all-things-Shermer than he is. Though Carl knows it, ‚ÄúI am the eyes and the ears of this institution.‚Äù Capelos‚Äô character was a collaborative move on Hughes‚Äô part. He began with Rick Moranis, who was going to play the janitor as a Russian-immigrant. The producer put his foot down against that idea. There was also, at one point, a gym teacher named Robin. Ally Sheedy, Molly Ringwald and a co-producer objected to the objectification of Robin through a peeping tom incident by Vernon. Hughes responded by giving Carl Robin‚Äôs lines.\n\nThese moves display the change in Hughes from 16 Candles and Weird Science to Breakfast Club/Ferris, etc. In a pretty far-reaching article, Molly Ringwald talks about the movie‚Äôs staying power and also the confrontations and/or engagements with John Hughes.\n\nIn one scene Carl has one jotter, in a later scene two. He doesn‚Äôt pull one out ever, there is no need for Carl to grow or transform as a character. He may be the only whole person in the entire film. And he was Shermer‚Äôs man of the year in 1969. Unpack that in light of Vernon and the Breakfast Club proper! What happened to him between Man of the Year in 1969 and March of 1984?\n\nCapelos did a lot of work we never saw for Hughes in the Breakfast Club, but if you wonder about his comedic chops, he is the bohunk in 16 Candles, and had a nice career.\n\nAll this to say: only Carl gets the better of, literally, everyone else in the film. The jotter gives you a hint of that, if you will but follow it. üôÇ\n\nShawshank‚Äôs jotter was one of the earliest sightings for me and it made too much sense until I watched the film with my 14 year old. Remember the first time you saw it? The friendships ‚Äì beautiful, the violence ‚Äì despair, and the tarring of the roof ‚Äì disarming. And then, Andy escapes Shawshank.\n\nIMDB lists Shawshank as the most popular film of all time. It wasn‚Äôt popular until it was nominated for 8 academy awards.\n\nThe warden writes with a Schaeffer Snorkel ‚Äì a beautiful pen, the most complex fountain pen manufactured, and retails for about 75. This one is seen on his desk when Andy plays the opera over the prison yard.\n\nAndy‚Äôs jotter is utilized to sign the last documents he signs for the warden. Did you ever imagine justice? Red and Andy on the beach of Zihuatanejo? And in your wildest dreams, pausing the movie to grab another drink or a snack, did you imagine it would be so swift, cruel, and violent? Even after so many months in the hole, his spirit seemingly broken, that glare of hatred, in the face of such obtuseness, is Tim Robbins at his best.\n\nRoger Ebert points out that none of the movie is seen from Andy‚Äôs perspective, but from everyone around him, most often from Freeman. Is this the one scene in which we see things from Andy‚Äôs perspective?\n\nI don‚Äôt need to add to the many, many lines written about this film. But it is an excellent jotter sighting.\n\nDeck Shifflet is squirmy. Confident; knows his limits. The jotter appears when we learn the full resources of Deck, applied to helping Rudy win. Deck pulls poor Rudy Baylor from the clutches of Bruiser in the nick of time; convincing him to set up a new law firm. In the moment above he contacts Bruiser for help; which no one knows is possible nor wise, nor beneficial. Bruiser recalls an actual law statue (though labeled differently) corrects a misunderstood and mis adapted part of the law (rare for Coppola and Grishham to miss) through Bruiser‚Äôs (Mickey Rourke) exceptional memory, especially as it applies to breaking the law while winning cases.\n\nIn a film with an obvious hero ‚Äî Rudy Baylor/Matt Damon. A slimy good guy ‚Äî Bruiser. A slough of slime ‚Äî Jon Voight, Roy Schieder. A brilliant judge ‚Äî Danny Glover. We could easily miss the brilliant efficiency of this film, the substance, tone and heart of Damon and Devito as they walk with each of their clients ‚Äî as it tuns out, none of whom will pay them.\n\nThis is the moment we can tell Devito is utilizing a Parker Jotter, the preeminent Hollywood prop whispering, ‚ÄúDo not miss the nobility of this character.‚Äù Earlier in the film, when he is training Rudy in ambulance chasing he has a pen, but we do not get a good look at it. It sounds like a jotter, but we are not sure. In retrospect, this is how the jotter works indirectly. We don‚Äôt yet know if we can trust him. We like him ‚Äî he knows the doctor and the security guard by name‚Ä¶ charming? Sure. Does he benefit? Yes. We do not know as they leave the hospital whether we can trust or rely upon Deck Schiffler.\n\nThis is widely believed to be the best adaptation of a Grisham novel. Coppola captures the near disgust Baylor has for his chosen profession ‚Äî much different than the energy of Cusack/Hackman/Hoffmann in Runaway Jury, Roberts/Washington in the Pelican Brief, and easily of Cruise/Tripplehorn/Hackman in the Firm. It is also Grisham‚Äôs favorite of the adaptations.\n\nPoint Break is a delight. Keanu masters the actions/unintentional comedy/hair of action movies, and you can argue that he did as much to develop the genre as anyone. For those of you who are thinking about Die Hard right now, watch the first 25 minutes of both movies. Die Hard is a terrific film, but less constant-action than Point Break. And those who are thinking of the Fast and the Furious, it is quite clear that it is ripping off Point Break ‚Äî with a hat tip at the same diner Johnny meets Tyler. Roger Ebert gave it 3.5 stars. And says this about Kathryn Bigelow, the director, ‚ÄúBigelow is an interesting director for this material. She is interested in the ways her characters live dangerously for philosophical reasons. They aren‚Äôt men of action, but men of thought who choose action as a way of expressing their beliefs.‚Äù She also directed Blue Steel, which is one of the scariest movies I saw in the 80s. Even scarier than Gremlins.\n\nEbert explains that we ought not dwell on the plot of the film. If we can suspend such summaries we are led into the delight of Point Break. A friend of a friend once performed Point Break in an Improv studio. Every actor was a pro except the one who played Keanu ‚Äî that one was from the audience. It worked like a charm. Rather than mocking, this can perhaps shed some light on the fact that everyone in this film is absolutely going for it.\n\nGary Busey is terrific. He is talking shit about Utah, who he has not yet met, with a blindfold on before undergoing an odd test for FBI agents back in LA in the early 90s. The iconic line of the scene, almost never relevant in my own life is, ‚ÄúWelcome to sea world kid‚Äù. He‚Äôs funny, smart, doesn‚Äôt like his boss (‚ÄúHarp‚Äù, played by John C. McGinley, who has done a LOT of voice work, and was a delight in Scrubs), and receives Keanu‚Äôs energy at the beginning of the film to propel them towards the Ex -Presidents.\n\nIn their first investigation, Busey has a blue Parker Jotter. You see it about five times. It does not show up for the rest of the film. No way the hero has or needs one ‚Äî we enjoy his role in the film, but there isn‚Äôt a shred of nobility to him that isn‚Äôt obvious, he‚Äôs arrogant as the day is long. The magic centers around Utah and Bodhi. Bodhi‚Äôs amoral, but compelling, leadership and drive. ‚ÄúThis was never about money‚Ä¶ it is about us against the system!‚Äù With Busey balancing their wildly ridiculous energy. Just enough madness. And meatball sandwiches.\n\nBusey is the key to this film staying an action movie, and not becoming a buddy cop movie. ‚ÄúUtah! Get me two!‚Äù They work together well, but will rarely go get a beer after work. Busey keeps the tension right where it should be ‚Äî between Utah and Bodhi ‚Äî never letting their boss take up too much airtime. Quickly dispatching the violent naked women of war-child‚Äôs gun house, and stealing Johnny from the crime scene he participated in.\n\nWelcome to Sea World indeed."
