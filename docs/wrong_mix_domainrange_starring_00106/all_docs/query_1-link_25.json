        "text": "American actor\n\nGarret Lee Dillahunt (born November 24, 1964)[1][2] is an American actor. He is best known for his work in television, including the roles Burt Chance on the Fox sitcom Raising Hope, for which he was nominated for the Critics' Choice Television Award for Best Actor in a Comedy Series, Jack McCall and Francis Wolcott in Deadwood, and John Dorie in Fear the Walking Dead (2018–2021). He has also appeared in The 4400, ER, Terminator: The Sarah Connor Chronicles, Burn Notice, Justified, and The Mindy Project. He starred in the Amazon Studios drama series Hand of God (2014–2017).\n\nIn film, Dillahunt has played supporting roles in No Country for Old Men, The Assassination of Jesse James by the Coward Robert Ford, Winter's Bone, Looper, and 12 Years a Slave.\n\nGarret Dillahunt was born in Castro Valley, California, the middle of three boys, and was raised in Selah, Washington, a suburb of Yakima.[3] In late 1981, Dillahunt's elder brother, Eric, died in a road accident near Ellensburg, after the car he was traveling in as a passenger, whose driver was drunk and speeding at the time, veered off the road.[4][5]\n\nAfter high school, Dillahunt attended the University of Washington, from which he graduated in 1987 with a B.A. in journalism, before earning an MFA in acting at New York University.[3]\n\nAfter spending years appearing in theatrical productions on and off Broadway, Dillahunt began pursuing television and film roles. He appeared as a regular in several short lived series on ABC and Showtime, and landed guest spots on TV shows such as The X-Files and NYPD Blue[6] among others, before playing two distinctly different characters on the HBO series Deadwood: Jack McCall in 2004 and Francis Wolcott in 2005 (Dillahunt returned in an uncredited role as a townsman in the 2019 Deadwood movie).[7] He later had a recurring role on USA Network's The 4400.\n\nDillahunt portrayed Steve Curtis for three seasons on ER (2005–06). Later roles included Dr. Michael Smith on HBO's John from Cincinnati; Cromartie, John Henry and George Laszlo on FOX's Terminator: The Sarah Connor Chronicles; Roman Nevikov, a Russian gangster, on NBC's Life; and Mason Turner, a paralyzed serial killer on Criminal Minds. He played Simon Escher in the Burn Notice third-season finale airing March 4, 2010 on USA, later reprising the role in the show's fourth and seventh seasons.\n\nDillahunt appeared in such films as The Assassination of Jesse James by the Coward Robert Ford, No Country for Old Men, The Road,[8] Winter's Bone, The Last House On The Left, TalhotBlonde, and the indie horror film Burning Bright.[9]\n\nFrom 2010 to 2014, Dillahunt co-starred as Burt Chance on the Fox comedy Raising Hope. He began a recurring role on The Mindy Project in 2015 and on The Guest Book in 2017.\n\nDillahunt starred in the 2018 action film Braven directed by Lin Oeding. Dillahunt played Kassen, the leader of a group of mercenaries and drug runners who retrieve the drug stash and plan to kill Joe Braven and his family. He joined the regular cast of the fourth season of Fear the Walking Dead as John Dorie.[10]\n\nIn 2007, Dillahunt married actress Michelle Hurd, daughter of actor Hugh Hurd.[11][12]\n\nKey † Denotes works that have not yet been released\n\nYear Title Role Notes 1999 Last Call Curtis 2001 Billings 2007 No Country for Old Men Wendell Screen Actors Guild Award for Outstanding Performance by a Cast in a Motion Picture Ed Miller 2008 Pretty Bird Carson Thrash John's Hand John Short film 2009 Water Pills Hal Short film Krug Stillo The Road Gang Member One Night Only Richard Short film 2010 Winter's Bone Sheriff Baskin Amigo Lt.
