So whether or not you’ve seen any of these movies or the shows they were inspired by, vote (via a comment) for one using any criteria you see fit to be our movie of the week:\n\nThe Flintstones (1994)\n\nGeorge of the Jungle (1997)\n\nFat Albert (2004)\n\nConspiracy Theories: it’s what I heard anyway…\n\nI was listening to a podcast recently that brought to light some pretty wild conspiracy theories that I hadn’t heard of. I want to share some of the wackiest ones with you, but first let’s acknowledge big ones. Would this be an accurate top 10 of the most famous and most talked about conspiracy theories?\n\nElvis and/or Hitler still alive\n\nPrincess Diana death planned\n\nClimate change as a hoax\n\nFlat earth\n\nThe Illuminati or New World Order\n\n9/11 as an inside job\n\nMoon landing as a hoax\n\nAliens active on earth (Building the pyramids, Stonehenge, etc.)\n\nCOVID-19\n\nJFK\n\nSome are understandable, other are pure lunacy. But never mind those. Let’s get to the main course: the wild ones that I hadn’t heard about until just recently. Perhaps you have. Either way, read carefully. You never know who’s watching!\n\nPandas aren’t real – Yup. This conspiracy says that pandas couldn’t make it as a species because 1) they’re bad at reproducing, 2) they are clumsy, and 3) they eat nothing but bamboo even though they’re built like carnivores. Therefore, according to believers, they are just people in panda suits putting on a show for us all. There are a lot of pandas in this world, in zoos across the globe and in the wild of China. So, like what is found in a lot of conspiracy theories, this is one very elaborate and expensive hoax to pull off.\n\nEarth is hollow – Scientists had released information about the earth’s make-up in 2014, and in it shared that little is actually known about the earth’s core. Therefore, of course, creative minds took it and ran. Not only do some say it’s hollow, others claim there is another earth inside of the earth.\n\nAvril Lavigne died and was replaced by a girl named Melissa – According to this theory, Lavigne took her own life under the pressures that come with worldwide fame as well as the death of her grandfather. A lookalike and voice-alike clone was then found to replace her so that money could still be made. One of their main arguments of adherents to this theory is that Lavigne hasn’t produced songs as good as the ones before that time. Similar to, and equally as nonsensical as, the belief that Paul McCartney died in 1966 and was replaced by a lookalike/sound-alike. And in that storyline, the band was gracious enough to leave us clues on their album covers so we could know the truth.\n\nBritney Spears was an agent on George W. Bush’s payroll – The idea here is that she was staging some of her craziest moments to distract everyone from the failures and blunders made by the Bush administration. In 2004, when one of his staff leaked the name of a undercover CIA agent, Britney went to Vegas, partied, and got married. When Cheney accidentally shot a friend, she almost dropped her baby and stole the spotlight. When Bush made a bewildering announcement of a “reformation of Al-Qaeda,” she shaved her head. Then when Obama won the 2008 election, she began her comeback releasing her Circus album, as if celebrating that she was done serving.\n\nMalala Yousafzai a Western spy – Yousafzai has been a hero of women’s education and women’s rights in Pakistan for more than a decade. The conspiracy theory could believably be an attempt to undermine her influence, as it claims that her attempted murder (shot in the face by the Taliban) was staged or made up as a way to discredit the Taliban. And somehow, all of this was carried out by the CIA, her own father, and Robert de Niro.\n\nChemtrails – You know how when you see planes flying overhead they leave what looks like a long trail of exhaust? It’s apparently a mix of fuel and condensation, but there have long been suspicions held by conspiracy theorists that they are actually streaks of poison being emitted and falling to the earth. This is allegedly done by the government for different reasons. One of them I heard from a customer of mine while I worked on his vehicle. He said that it was pesticides to ruin farmers’ crops so that they can control how much they yield. Somehow it would also make the farmers more reliant on the government. You’d think someone getting in office would want to be a hero and blow the whistle.\n\nPrince Charles is a vampire – I think this mainly had to do with him being a direct descendent of Vlad the Impaler, who was the inspiration of Brahm Stoker’s Dracula. That and Porphyria, a disease that makes its sufferers sensitive to sunlight, runs through his royal family. Surely enough evidence for all of us to be believers.\n\nHarry Styles and Louis Tomlinson of One Direction a couple – I’m not sure if the “shippers” were fans or haters, but they spread the idea that these two band members were secretly a couple, appearing with women only to cover up their relationship. They both deny it, of course, but they do admit one thing: the conspiracy theory has made things weird when they’re together in the public eye.\n\nThe world ended in 2012 – This isn’t just the Mayan calendar prediction of the end of the world. This theory says that in 2012 Planet Earth was sucked into a black hole when CERN discovered the Higgs Boson particle that year. It claims that we all just haven’t realized this yet, either because we’re living in a simulation or because all of our minds are still active, causing us to think we’re alive as our remains are floating in space from the giant catastrophe.\n\nDenver International Airport is headquarters for evil world-domination – There are gargoyles and strange murals throughout this airport. I’ve seen them myself. The murals are beautiful and tell a story of peace and restoration, but the few depictions of death and war made people sure that it had to do with the Illuminati. Even the artists who painted the murals lost out on valuable commissions after the mural was completed and rumours swirled. But that’s the thing about super secret groups of elites who plan to take over the world. They often mistakenly give clues that announce their presence.\n\nCongratulations Don’t Look Up. This is your week.\n\nAnd the Oscar goes to…\n\nBest Actress: Julia Roberts as Alice Sutton, in Conspiracy Theory\n\nBest Actor: Kevin Costner as Jim Garrison in JFK\n\nBest Quote: “It’s called scotoma. The mind sees what it chooses to see.” – Ian McKellen as Sir Leigh Teabing in The Da Vinci Code\n\nThis is not to say any and all conspiracy theories are wrong. Reader’s Digest published an article on ones that turned out to be true. You can read it here.\n\nPick your movie of the week: Conspiracy Theories (June 9-15, 2024)\n\nConspiracy theories can be interesting, frustrating, funny, scary, and insulting all at the same time. All of the movies listed below, this week’s nominees, deal with them in their own ways. Have you seen any of them? Would you pick any one of them to be our movie of the week? If so, vote with a comment:\n\nJFK (1991)\n\nConspiracy Theory (1997)\n\nThe Da Vinci Code (2006)\n\nDon’t Look Up (2021)\n\nComedies: The Best in Every Category\n\nA few weeks ago I was trying to come up with the “Mount Rushmore” of every movie genre, and I found comedy the hardest category.

Get the flunk out of here!” – Shecky Greene as Marcus Vindictus in Cast Away\n\nEditor’s Note…\n\nWhen I wrote about breakfast cereal mascots, I said that the Quaker Man was “Too old-time religion looking.” Well, just tonight I started Unfrosted and heard the same kind of joke made by Jerry Seinfeld. I swear, I did not see that movie before writing. I’m not sure it matter, because in both cases it wasn’t that funny anyway.\n\nPick your movie of the week: Mel Brooks (June 2-8, 2024)\n\nHe’s one of the absolute masters of comedies and spoofs. And he’s the source of many great movie experiences of mine. I may be wrong here, but I thought Spaceballs (1987) would easily win the votes, so I went with 3 other movies that I believe are his funniest besides that one. Choose on to be our movie of the week, and vote with a comment:\n\nYoung Frankenstein (1974)\n\nBlazing Saddles (1974)\n\nHistory of the World: Part I (1981)\n\nThanks Hanks: Rating Every Tom Hanks Movie I’ve Seen\n\nFor at least the past decade, Tom Hanks has become the most favourited Hollywood actor. A kind of living legend. Growing up, my family and I all loved watching his movies, and the same is true with the family my wife and I started together. I discovered that I’ve seen 34 of the 72 he’s starred in.\n\nThe DaVinci Code (2006)\n\nAngels and Demons (2009)\n\nPinocchio (2022)\n\nDragnet (1987)\n\nThe Polar Express (2004)\n\nRoad to Perdition (2002)\n\nA Man Called Otto (2022)\n\nSaving Mr. Banks (2013)\n\nThat Thing You Do (1996)\n\nSully (2016)\n\nSleepless in Seattle (1993)\n\nExtremely Loud and Incredibly Close (2011)\n\nBig (1988)\n\nSplash (1984)\n\nGreyhound (2020)\n\nBridge of Spies (2015)\n\nThe Terminal (2004)\n\nA Beautiful Day in the Neighborhood (2019)\n\nTurner & Hooch (1989)\n\nThe Green Mile (1999)\n\nCaptain Phillips (2013)\n\nThe Money Pit (1986)\n\nThe Post (2017)\n\nCatch Me If You Can (2002)\n\nElvis (2022)\n\nPhiladelphia (1993)\n\nCast Away (2000)\n\nThe Burbs (1989)\n\nApollo 13 (1995)\n\nNews of the World (2020)\n\nToy Story (1995)\n\nA League of Their Own (1992)\n\nForrest Gump (1994)\n\nSaving Private Ryan (1998)\n\nAnd these would be my top 10 favourite Tom Hanks performances:\n\nFred Rogers in A Beautiful Day in the Neighbourhood\n\nJosh Baskin in Big\n\nViktor Navorski in The Terminal\n\nCpt. Richard Phillips in Captain Phillips\n\nWoody in Toy Story (1-4)\n\nCpt. Kidd in News of the World\n\nChuck Noland in Cast Away\n\nAndrew Beckett in Philadelphia\n\nJimmy Dugan in A League of Their Own\n\nForrest Gump in Forrest Gump\n\nCongratulations Cast Away. This is your week.\n\nAnd the Oscar goes to…\n\nBest Actress: Scarlett Johansson as Rosie in Jojo Rabbit\n\nBest Actor: James Stewart as Elwood P. Dowd in Harvey\n\nBest Quote: “WILSON!” – Tom Hanks as Chuck Noland in Cast Away\n\nIt should be noted that there are really only 2 of the movies above that I would say I didn’t like: The Da Vinci Code and Angels and Demons. Yes, I even liked Pinocchio enough to watch it again (but not too many times, mind you…). So, it killed me to look at the bottom 10. I hate to see so many good movies sitting in those spots. But that’s just a testament to Hanks’ excellent run of great films.\n\nPick your movie of the week: Imaginary Friends (May 26-June 1, 2024)\n\nYesterday was a good day. I went to the theater twice within a 12-hour period. Joy and I went to see the new Amy Winehouse biopic, then Luke and I took in IF. The latter was directed by John Krasinksi and is about imaginary friends. So that’s the theme this week, and all the following movies have that as an element of their story. Which one do you pick to be our movie of the week? Vote with a comment:\n\nHarvey (1950)\n\nCast Away (2000)\n\nJojo Rabbit (2019)\n\nJust Say Nope: Anti-drug movies\n\nI loved going to youth group when I was a teenager. I remember us having a guest speaker one Sunday who mentioned that TV and movies “glorify” alcohol, drugs, and other evils. For the longest time I believed this. But looking back now, I’m not sure any motivational speaker, television PSA, or scary story was ever effective at being anti-drugs than movies.\n\nI mean all through elementary school one could hardly go a week without hearing a lecture about the dangers of cigarettes. We heard about the diseases and how many lives they claim. We heard how many adults say they wished they’d never started. We had health textbooks illustrated with gruesome pictures. But as soon as we all entered grade 7, boom, every 12 year old had a ciggy between their teeth.\n\nBut movies are pretty darn effective in turning one away from drugs. Sure, they do depict drugs from time to time, which is very different from celebrating them. I count marijuana as an exception, case in point being Cheech and Chong. That’s another discussion for another day.\n\nSo here are the top 10 films that could cause anyone to just say nope!\n\nAnd these are ranked according to effectiveness:\n\nFlight (2012) – The master Denzel Washington as a pilot in a well told story of alcohol use disorder. The climax is one of those scenes that has been etched in my brain. I actually think about it often.\n\nAmy (2015) – Most of us have heard about the tragic end of Amy Winehouse at only 27. So young, but so influential already. Taken too soon by a disease that can end a life faster than cancer.\n\nTraffic (2000) – I was always a Benecio del Toro and Catherine Zeta-Jones fan after watching this movie. It’s an eye-opener with regards to drug trafficking more than drug use. But it’s gritty depiction of the subject helped viewers understand the wide scope of the problem.\n\nScarface (1983) – If Tony Montana can’t convince someone not to do cocaine, I’m not sure anyone will.\n\n28 Days (2000) – This is probably my favourite Sandra Bullock movie. It doesn’t show much of the horrors of drug abuse, but it brings the viewer to a deeper sense of understanding and compassion for those in recovery.\n\nThirteen (2003) – The title refers to the age of the two main characters. You can see how easily things can accelerate in the wrong direction for impressionable young teenagers.\n\nBeautiful Boy (2018) – Incredible movie. It is tragic in nature, and an important depiction of adducts and their loved ones.\n\nThe Basketball Diaries (1995) – An early Leonardo DiCaprio arguably made a bigger name for himself in this one than in What’s Eating Gilbert Grape (1993), which says a lot.\n\nTrainspotting (1996) – For the first while, it seems like it’s a film that is making light of drug use, maybe even making it cool. Until it doesn’t… and wow, it’s effective.\n\nRequiem for a Dream (2000) – This is a harrowing movie, not for the faint of heart. Like Thirteen, one can have a better understanding of how someone can so easily slip into a trap of addiction.\n\nHONOURABLE MENTIONS: When a Man Loves a Woman (1994); The Lost Weekend (1945)\n\nCongratulations Scarface. This is your week.\n\nAnd the Oscar goes to…\n\nBest Actress: Lindsay Lohan as Anna Coleman/Tess Coleman in Freaky Friday\n\nBest Actor: Al Pacino as Tony Montana in Scarface\n\nBest Quote: “To watch a strong man broken down is a terrible thing.” – Esther Scott as Bridget in The Birth of a Nation\n\nWe all have safeguards in our lives to protect us from addiction, but it can still happen to anyone. The most important thing is to not be ashamed to get help. We are all humans. We all struggle. There’s no shame in needing help, only in judging those who do."
