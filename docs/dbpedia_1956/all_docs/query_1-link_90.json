Kimberly Wyatt Kimberly Wyatt\n\nSelf, Episode #1.1\n\n2. Sidney Toler Sidney Toler\n\nActor, Charlie Chan in the Secret Service\n\nSidney Toler, best known for his portrayal of Charlie Chan, the Chinese detective, made his debut on the Toler Opera House stage.\n\nBorn:April 28, 1874inWarrensburg, Missouri, USA\n\nSidney Sommesr Tolers was born in Warrensburg, Missouri, the son of a renowned horse-breeder. Col. H. G. Toler in 1874; three weeks later, the family moved to a stock farm near Wichita, Kansas where he grew up.\n\nDied:\n\nFebruary 12, 1947(age 72) in Beverly Hills, Los Angeles, California, USA The son of Colonel H.G. Toler, breeder of trotting horses, Sidney acted on stage by the time he was seven years old. He was an established star of the theatre by the 1890's, long before his career in motion pictures. He was also active as a playwright and had a good enough voice to be cast as a lead baritone with an operatic stock company at the Orpheum Theatre in New York.\n\nFather of Sidney...\n\nH. G. TOLER, a Director of the Garfield University, and a real-estate agent, is one of the leading citizens of Wichita, and is prominently identified with the business men of Sedgwick County. He is a native of Richmond, Va., born Oct. 2, 1846, to George W. and Susan A. (Jones) Toler, likewise natives of Virginia. His father was very prominent and influential in public and political affairs in Virginia's capital city. He was a member of the Old Richmond Blues, and was Mayor of Richmond for one year, being the first one elected to that high office by the Know-Nothing party. He was actively interested in educational matters, and as he was well-to-do gave his children a fine education. While he remained a resident of Richmond he was prosperously engaged in the loan, real-estate and brokerage business. In 1855 he removed with his family to Kansas City, Mo., then a town of 300 inhabitants, and there he engaged in furnishing steamboats with supplies, continuing in that business five years. Subsequently he became an auctioneer, and followed that calling until his death in 1866. He took a leading part in public affairs while he lived in Kansas City, and for a number of years held the office of Recorder. He was a man of remarkable decision of character, and business talents of a high order. His wife survived him several years. In 1872 she removed with her family to St. Louis, where they remained until 1874, thence to Plattsburg, Mo., and from there in 1878 to Wichita, Kan., where the mother died in 1880. To her and her husband had been born two sons and two daughters, as follows: Mrs. C. W. Parry, of Kansas City; Mrs. M. S. Lovejoy, of Penos, Old Mexico; Edwin W., of Kansas City, where he is engaged in the real-estate business with another gentleman, under the firm name of Toler & Evart, and H. G.\n\nThe subject of this sketch started out from the parental home at the age of fourteen years to learn to become a self-supporting and self-reliant member of society, and as a means to that end entered the printing-office of the Kansas City Advertiser, afterward the Kansas City Times, and was in the employ of the editors of that sheet for two and one-half years. He then went to New Mexico, driving six yoke of cattle across the plains. This was a long, tedious, but most eventful journey, and our subject thought that if he ever returned alive no one should ever catch him in another such fix. This was in the fall and winter of 1864-65, it taking him six months to travel across the plains to his destination, and the winter season was one of unusual severity. He saw many outfits burning their ox-yokes, their loads of bacon, flour, corn, and everything that would keep them warm, and many men were frozen while sitting on their mules. He returned from his trip to Mexico with nothing but a supply of wood and corn; some members of his party were frozen; one man had to have his legs and arms amputated.\n\nOn his return to Kansas City from his memorable Mexican trip Mr. Toler entered into the employ of Scott, Cutler & Co., wholesale groccrs, representing that house on the road, being the first gentleman so employed by any business firm of Kansas City; he traveled on horseback, with a pair of saddle-bags, visiting Paola, Garnett, and other places within a circuit of 100 miles of his headquarters, He continued to represent that firm until they were burned out. When his father died the care of the family devolved on our subject, as his brother was married, and had a family of his own to care for. Subsequently Mr. Toler engaged in the horse trade, and followed it two years. He then engaged in the liquor and wholesale grocery business until 1872. He then removed with his family to St. Louis, where he became interested in the tea business with Hugh Menown, continuing with him until their establishment was burned out in 1875. He then went in with Forbes Bros. in the tea business, traveling on the road until 1876; our subject then returned to Kansas City, and entered into the wholesale grocery business with Cochrane, Carroll & Beckham, continuing with them the ensuing three years, and while thus employed moved his family to Wichita, Kan., where he afterward established himself in the retail grocery business. Finding that it did not pay he sold out, and went on the road again, this time for Bittman, Taylor & Co., of Leavenworth, Kan., continuing with them until 1884. In 1885 Mr. Toler opened an office in Wichita, for the purpose of engaging in the real-estate business, which he has since prosecuted with much success, and in the very few years that have elapsed since he first started out he has so increased his property that he may now be numbered among the wealthy men of this city. He is a man of marked energy and enterprise, and while laying the foundations of his own prosperity has greatly aided in building up Wichita. He has made seven additions to the city, platted and disposed of the same, and has erected twenty houses in the northern part of the city. He purchased 515 acres of land five miles from the city, and has converted it into a valuable stock farm, devoting it to the breeding of fine horses and Jersey cattle. Our subject is a Director in the State National Bank, of Wichita, and a Director of the Wichita City Street Railway. He is noted for his unbounded generosity, benevolence and public-spiritedness. He takes a marked interest in educational matters, is one of the Directors of Garfield University, and has donated liberally to its support, as well as to other public institutions in the city.\n\nMr. Toler was married, in 1867, to Miss Sallie J. Frame, of Kansas City, and niece of Allen Frame. Of their union three sons have been born - Foster, Edwin C., and H. G., Jr. Our subject and his wife are leading members of the Christian Church. It was mainly through the earnest and persistent efforts of Mrs. Toler and Mrs. Ella G. Shields, daughter of Gov. Glenn, of Illinois, that this church was established; they called a meeting of those in sympathy with the religious views of the Christian Church, organized a church, the first one in the city of that denomination, and employed the Rev. T. J. Shelton as the pastor.\n\nMr. Toler is a Democrat in politics; socially he is an Odd Fellow and a Knight of Pythias, belonging to First Lodge No. 1, of Missouri.\n\n3. Shawn Pelton, born in Warrensburg, Missouri, June 1, 1963, is an American drummer for Saturday Night Live, SNL, and percussionist. He has recorded with a wide range of artists and has been a first call player since moving to New York in the late 1980s.\n\nKnown for his great feel, deep soulful pocket and a high level of musicianship across a broad range of styles, Shawn has recorded with artists such as Sheryl Crow,Shawn Colvin, Natalie Merchant, Ingrid Michaelson, Billy Joel,Van Morrison, Elton John, Rod Stewart, Johnny Cash, Roseanne Cash, Pink, Shakira, Kelly Clarkson, Five For Fighting, Michelle Branch, Regina Spektor, Tears for Fears, Citizen Cope, Matisyahu, Jonatha Brooke, David Byrne, Edie Brickell, Marc Cohn, Richie Havens, Joan Osborne, Hall and Oates, Odetta, Pavarotti, Phillip Phillips,George Michael, Carly Simon, Dixie Chicks, Chris Botti and Buddy Guy, and has played on several Grammy winning albums for artists including Ray Charles, The Brecker Brothers, Shakira, Shawn Colvin, Les Paul and theHank Williams tribute album with Bob Dylan.\n\nLive, From New York … It’s Shawn Pelton\n\nSaturday morning, deadly cold, and New York City’s biggest blizzard of the winter is going to start dumping snow all over us any second now. Usually, I’d be curled up at home with a cup of cocoa laughing at all the suckers who have to be out there in the two-foot drifts.\n\nToday, however, it seems like the laugh’s on me, since my assignment to spend a day on the set of Saturday Night Live with pocket drummer extraordinaire Shawn Pelton just happens to be on January 22, when anyone with any sense is home and staying there. But what I don’t know yet is that the next 14 hours are going to add up to one of the strangest, most memorable days I’ve had in a long time.\n\nA day at SNL may be a mindblow for the average civilian, but for Pelton, who’s been doing it since 1992, it’s a nuttiness he’s learned to live with. “It’s a long day,” says Pelton, whose soft Southern-gentleman drawl belies the raw power of his playing. “If you’re starting out at 10:00 A.M., by the time it’s after midnight — well — you’ve been playing since that morning. It’s more like a focus/concentration thing, because you’re totally worn out by the end of the day.\n\n“But it’s such a lucky break, because it’s only 20 live tapings a year and you’re free to do other things. It’s like having a steady live gig in town that allows you to keep roots in what’s left of the New York City session thing — if you’re always out on the road, producers don’t necessarily know if you’re in town.”\n\n10:40 A.M./O\" Of Snow\n\nI’m standing at one of New York’s more famous addresses, the NBC building at 49 W. 49th Street, smack in the middle of the city’s famed Rockefeller Center. The blizzard of ’05 is about to show up, so is Shawn Pelton, and I’m eager to meet him. He has a reputation as one of the most solid pocket drummers in the business, at a level that’s seen him compared with Bernard Purdie, Rick Marotta, Steve Gadd, “J.R.” Robinson, Al Jackson Jr., and Jeff Porcaro — damn good company. It’s a skill that’s not only kept him on the SNL stage for a decade-plus, but put him on tour or on record with the likes of Sheryl Crow, Bob Dylan, Bruce Springsteen, Ray Charles, David Byrne, Billy Joel, Buddy Guy, the Brecker Brothers, and hundreds more.\n\nPelton seems like he’s a few minutes late, and the 11:00 A.M. rehearsal with the rest of the SNL band is coming on fast, so I pull my phone out of my pocket to check the time. It goes off in my hands: it’s Pelton, who asks me where I am. I tell him I’m outside the chocolate shop on 49th where we said we’d meet. Turns out he’s standing inside. Score one for street smarts on this frigid day.\n\nSafely inside, Pelton and I shake hands. He’s wearing his trademark black cap and a sleepy grin, and takes me over to the security desk for my visitor’s pass, which will be my lifeline for moving in and out of this TV world for the next half-day plus. Thus armed, Pelton and I bypass the metal detectors and head to the elevators, which work on a system too complex for my frozen brain to figure out. Fortunately, Pelton’s been pushing the buttons long enough to know the trick, and up we go to NBC’s legendary Studio 8H.\n\n11:00 A.M./O\" Of Snow\n\nUpstairs, I’m blown away to be striding quickly through a hall packed with props and the smell of fresh glue and paint, through to a studio I’ve been watching on TV ever since my parents started letting me stay up on the weekends. Originally built to accommodate NBC Symphony radio broadcasts conducted by the great Arturo Toscanini, 8H has been home to Saturday Night Live since the show premiered on October 11, 1975.\n\nAbsorbing the fact that this is where the original cast of comic greats — from Dan Akroyd, John Belushi, Chevy Chase, and Jane Curtin to this year’s group, including Tina Fey, Amy Poehler, and Darrell Hammond — romped has to happen quickly. That’s because next I have to absorb the fact that some of the most memorable musical performances I’ve ever seen also took place here, by Nirvana, En Vogue, Big Country, Foo Fighters, Sinead O’Connor (if you call ripping up a picture of the Pope and the sound of silence music), and the SNL band itself — the backbone of it all.\n\nWhile I’m trying to drink it all in, Pelton’s just trying to drink his coffee as he and I breeze past the cluttered sets, through jumbled masses of actors and stagehands, to climb past a heavy curtain (which is there to keep the noise of the band down on the set during their rehearsal) and up on the riser where the band does its thing, 20 Saturdays a year. If Pelton seems a little blasé about being a regular on one of TV’s most storied stages, it’s only because he’s worked damn hard to get there and stay there.\n\nJanet Ulrich Brooks\n\njanet-ulrich-brooks-performer-of-the-week\n\nHeight\n\n5' 6\" (1.68 m)\n\nTrivia\n\nShe was nominated for a 2008 Joseph Jefferson Award Citation for Actress in a Supporting Role in a Play for \"A Lie of the Mind\" at the Strawdog Theatre Company in Chicago, Illinois.\n\nShe was nominated for a 2009 Joseph Jefferson Award for Actress in a Principal Role in a Play for \"Not Enough Air\" at the TimeLine Theatre Company in Chicago, Illinois.\n\nShe was nominated for a 2009 Joseph Jefferson Award for Actress in a Supporting Role in a Play for \"Weekend\" at the TimeLine Theatre Company in Chicago, Illinois.\n\nShe was nominated for a 2010 Joseph Jefferson Award for Actress in a Supporting Role in a Play for \"When She Danced\" at the TimeLine Theatre Company in Chicago, Illinois.\n\nShe was nominated for a 2010 Joseph Jefferson Award for Actress in a Principal Role in a Play for her performance in \"All My Sons\" at the TimeLine Theatre Company in Chicago, Illinois.\n\nShe was nominated for a 2012 Equity Joseph Jefferson Award for Actress in a Principal Role in a Play for \"A Walk in the Woods\" at the TimeLine Theatre Company in Chicago, Illinois.\n\nJanet Ulrich Brooks (Kate Deckhouse) is a company member of TimeLine Theatre Company, where she has appeared in A Walk in the Woods, All My Sons, When She Danced, Not Enough Air, Weekend, Tesla’s Letters,Paradise Lost, Lillian and A Man for All Seasons.
