He was raised in Clarks Hill and graduated from Lauramie High School in 1958. Growing up and throughout his life, Marv was an athlete and avid sports fan. His record would show his basketball career was so profound that there was a poem written for him after he scored the winning shot from half court.\n\nHe loved baseball too. Marv was an amazing pitcher, so good he had an invitation to try-out for the Chicago White Sox, but that opportunity fell short after he met the love of his life, Sharon Kay Burton, and while he was woo-ing her on a date at the Frankfort Fair, he threw his arm out while trying to impress her and win her a prize.\n\nMarv and Sharon were married at Stockwell Methodist Church on August 27, 1961, and started their epic love story that lasted nearly 63 years.\n\nHe started his career at Alcoa. While Alcoa was shut down, he had the opportunity to work for Bob Higman Engines – building race cars and working in a pit crew at the Indy 500. After Alcoa, Marv worked at Kmart as the manager of the sporting goods department, letting his love for sports continue. He also worked at The Sportsman for many years, but ultimately retired after owning MVP Sports in Lafayette.\n\nHis children, Steve (Ginny) Wheeler of Flora, IN, and Barb (Troy) Bruce of Lafayette, were his pride and joy. Family meant everything to him, and Marv would take every opportunity to brag about them to whoever would listen. Growing up, Steve and Barb remember that Dad was present in every moment, big or small! His appreciation and admiration for his family was obvious, and his love was pure.\n\nMarv’s truest treasures were his 5 grandchildren: Josh (Hayley) Wheeler, Greg (Lance Connolly) Wheeler, Erika (Jerry) Knotts, Mason Bruce, and Karsyn (Logan) Martin, and 7 great-grandchildren: Meredith Wheeler, Ella Wheeler, Haddie Wheeler, Tenley Knotts, Trenton Knotts, Waylon Wheeler and Walter Wheeler. Pa was the best of the best. Whether he was taking you fishing, to the woodshed, showing you how to mow, attending the moments that mattered, or serving up homemade ice cream and home grown strawberries, Pa’s presence was profound. The memories made were endless and will forever be cherished.\n\nAlong with his parents, Marv was preceded in death by 3 brothers, 3 sisters, and his great-grandson, Grayson Wheeler.\n\nFamily will receive friends on Wednesday, April 24, 2024, from 4:00PM – 7:00PM at Soller Baker Lafayette Chapel. There will be a private burial at Yorktown Cemetery in Stockwell, IN.\n\nIn lieu of flowers, the family requests memorial contributions be made to Woodhaven Rescue Farm. Envelopes will be available.

She graduated from Camden High School in 1946. She dated Robert E. “Bob” Scholl for three years before they married on Sept. 24, 1949, sharing 67 years of marriage. He preceded her in death six years ago on Feb. 2, 2017.\n\nMarge would be the first to tell you, she was a farm girl and she was proud of it. She loved being a farmer’s wife, helping her husband with the crops and animals and meticulously keeping the farm’s records as she lovingly raised their two children. She was a great cook with fried chicken, baked macaroni and cheese and pies some of her specialties. She also enjoyed creating beautiful flower gardens that many people stopped to admire.\n\nCamden was the community where she grew up and where she made many life-long friends. When her children, Gary and Colleen, were in school, Marge was a member of the Mother’s Lunch Club, taking her turn preparing meals for students at the Camden School. She served two terms as club president. Marge had many fond memories of growing up in the Camden community, attending school there, and serving as a Lunch Lady.\n\nFor many years, Marge and Bob were season ticket holders for Purdue Girls’ Basketball games. They had a lot of fun attending those games and getting to know the players.\n\nThey were also a part of a card club and a New Year’s Eve group that got together for many years. Marge loved those good times with their friends. Family get-togethers and reunions were also high on her list of favorite things, as well as gatherings at church.\n\nHer faith in God was an important part of her life, guiding her through many of life’s ups and downs. She was a member of Lower Deer Creek Church of the Brethren, but in later years joined the Flora Presbyterian Church.\n\nMarge was a compassionate, kind person, always willing to lend a helping hand whether it was caring for children while their parents recovered from an illness or elderly people who needed someone they could depend on. She would care for them all just like they were her own family and in some instances they were family members.\n\nMarge loved her home in Flora and her neighbors. She welcomed their visits as well as those from friends and family, especially her grandchildren and great-grandchildren. She was fond of drives in the country and golf cart rides with her neighbor.\n\nOn April 30, 2021, she moved to assisted living at St. Elizabeth Healthcare. There, she made new friends, including residents and staff. She enjoyed the fellowship from provided activities, playing bingo and cards, and going on van trips with Jim.\n\nMarge had many titles throughout her lifetime, but most cherished were Mom, Grandma and MaMa. Her life was full and rich and blessed.\n\nSurviving are a son and daughter-in-law, Gary and Susan Scholl of Flora; two grandchildren, Drew Scholl (wife Julie) of Carmel and Maggie Randle (husband Eric) of Flora; three great-grandsons, Brenton Jackson, Oliver Scholl and Ethan Randle; a sister-in-law, Joyce Brubaker of Kokomo; and several nieces and nephews.\n\nThe most difficult time in Marge’s life was the untimely death of her daughter at age 20 in 1975. Others preceding her in death were her parents and three siblings, Lowell Brubaker, Joe Brubaker and Betty Edging.\n\nService will be at 2 p.m. on Saturday, Feb. 25, at Wheeler Family Funeral Home-Baker Chapel, Flora, with visitation from 12:30 to 2 p.m. prior to the service.
