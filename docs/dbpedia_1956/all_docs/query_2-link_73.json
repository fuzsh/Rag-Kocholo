        "text": "Four Charlie Chan films have made their DVD debuts this week, along with some other long-sought-after vintage titles.\n\n“Charlie Chan Collection” (Warner, 1946-48, b/w, four discs, $39.92, four films). The four films collected here include one of Sidney Toler’s last, the 1946 “Shadows Over Chinatown,” along with three from 1948 starring Roland Winters, “Docks of New Orleans,” “Shanghai Chest” and “The Golden Eye.”\n\nTo be honest, these are not nearly up to the quality of the early 1930s Chan films — but that won’t matter to fans that are anxious collectors, and they’ve waited a long time to see these titles issued. One more future set could mean all the Chan films will be on DVD, except for a handful of “lost” titles we will likely never see.\n\n“The Damned” (Cohen/Blu-ray, 1947, b/w, $34.98, in French with English subtitles, audio commentary, hourlong 2010 documentary: “Rene Clement or The Cinema of Sketches,” trailers; eight-page booklet). Not to be confused with the famous 1969 Visconti film of the same title, this French thriller is directed by Rene Clement and explores issues that were still an open wound when it was released in 1947, just two years after World War II.\n\nClement tightens the screws in this gripping story of desperate people lodged within the claustrophobic confines of a submarine in April 1945 as Allied bombings signal the end is near for the Third Reich. Aboard the sub are Nazis and sympathizers who are fleeing France for South America when they make a stop to kidnap a French doctor to attend to one of their group. But it isn’t long before he realizes he will become expendable as they get closer to their destination. Fine performances, taut direction by Clement. (Also on DVD, $24.98)\n\n“Three Faces East” (Warner Archive, 1930, b/w, $18.95). Very early talkie (a remake of a 1926 silent film adapted from a 1918 play) has Constance Bennett and Eric Von Stroheim as spies during World War I who find themselves facing off in a game of cat and mouse at the British estate of a member of the British Admiralty. The film’s stage roots are revealed early, but the actors strive to keep it afloat. (Available at www.WarnerArchive.com)\n\n“Sweet Revenge” (aka “Dandy, the All-American Girl,” Warner Archive, 1976, PG, $18.95, trailer). Stockard Channing is excellent as an overconfident charmer in this offbeat melodrama with comic moments. She’s an obsessive car thief and shoplifter with multiple identities who is taken under the wing of a sympathetic public defender (Sam Waterston, a decade-and-a-half before he became a prosecutor on “Law & Order”). Franklyn Ajaye co-stars. (Available at www.WarnerArchive.com)\n\n“Mitchell” (Warner Archive, 1975; R for violence, language; $18.95). Notoriously lampooned by the “Mystery Science Theater 3000” guys, this action thriller starring Joe Don Baker is fairly typical ’70s revenge fare as a police detective ignores orders to investigate a shady killing, and it leads him to stolen drugs worth millions. Despite the “MST3K” mocking, “Mitchell” does have a cult following that should be pleased by this widescreen transfer, easily the film’s best DVD presentation yet. Co-stars include Martin Balsam, John Saxon, Linda Evans and Utah’s own Merlin Olsen. (Available at www.WarnerArchive.com)\n\nChris Hicks is the author of \"Has Hollywood Lost Its Mind?
