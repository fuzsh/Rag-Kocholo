        "text": "Douglas Fairbanks Jr. (1909-2000) was the son of the silent screen’s most beloved hero Douglas Fairbanks Sr. and quite a legendary screen star in his own right. I never got to meet him in person, although I’m happy to say a request for an interview sent to his office was welcomed warmly, and in the end, it resulted in a phone interview in August 1999. So I got to call him at his New York apartment, and what a tremendous joy it was. I did hope however, that he would allow me to come over, and in that case, I’d fly from Europe to New York with the sole purpose of interviewing him. That’s also what I wrote in my first letter to him.\n\nIn his kind and warm response, Mr. Fairbanks wrote, ‘I am flattered indeed to read that you are considering a trip to New York to interview me. Although I would be happy to speak with you, I wonder if you wouldn’t be just as happy to interview me on the telephone? I leave that decision to you.’ Since film has always been a vocation to me, I have crossed the Atlantic regularly during the past 35 years, always with one single purpose in mind: to interview actors and filmmakers and talk about their work and their craft. That’s what I do, that’s who I am. So when I got to speak with Mr. Fairbanks on the phone—courtesy of Mrs. Fairbanks—I still hoped that some day soon we would be able to continue our conversation in New York. I also told him so, and I asked him if he would greenlight this request. ‘By all means,’ he said. Sadly, it didn’t work out since Mrs. Fairbanks didn’t think it was a good idea. A decision I always understood and respected: I’m sure she had her reasons to turn down my one-on-one interview request—along with a huge box of the most delicious Belgian chocolates I would have loved to have given her as a token of my sincere appreciation.\n\nOver twenty years later, I wanted to update my interview with Mr. Fairbanks which was published in a Dutch-language film monthly, but horror of horrors, the cassette tape with Mr. Fairbanks’ phone interview didn’t stand the test of time too well. I went through it a couple of times, and the audio is of such poor quality that it’s very tough to reproduce a complete transcript of the interview. Fortunately, I was able to pick up several quotes when he reminisced about people he worked with or that he knew over the years.\n\nSo I had to work my way around it, just to prevent that this interview with him would merely turn into a short biography of his career as a leading man up until the late 1940s and early 1950s. That was a challenge, but for me personally, I will always be honored to say that I spoke with him, it was a privilege that he spent twenty minutes of his life on the phone with me, and in truth, with a family tree and personal history as his, how far can you go back in film history?\n\nBefore our conversation, I had read the two fascinating volumes of his autobiography that he had written, “My Salad Days” (1988) and “A Hell of a War” (1993), covering his colorful life until the mid-1940s. And it needs to be said, this charismatic and versatile film personality was a real survivor: as one of the very few actors still around (back then) who made his screen debut in the early 1920s, he later on also became a pioneer in television as a producer and host of his own successful series “Douglas Fairbanks Jr. Presents,” a London-based anthology series made for American TV, in the 1950s.\n\nMr. Fairbanks was born in New York City on December 9, 1909, as the son of Douglas Fairbanks Sr. (1883-1939) and his first wife, Anna Beth Sully (1888-1967), the daughter of a wealthy cotton king. At that time, his father was already an established Broadway star, admired for the same qualities that would make him a screen hero—he was the prototype of the idealized image of the American male. In 1915, when Mr. Fairbanks Jr. was 6, his father left the New York stage and headed for Los Angeles, where the Triangle Film Corporation offered him a generous contract. Subsequently, young Douglas went back and forth from New York to California with his mother over the next few years. He saw his father’s rise to fame, and he often went to see his films in the theater. ‘There was never a moment in my life when I suddenly realized he was famous,’ Mr. Fairbanks said, ‘I just think I grew up with that realization. But I admired him enormously. When I was young, I didn’t see him that often and we weren’t very close, but during his final years, we were.’\n\nHis parents divorced in 1918, and since then, he was raised by his mother while his father, the screen’s top box office attraction for many years to come, founded United Artists in 1919 with Charlie Chaplin, D.W. Griffith, and America’s Sweetheart and wife-to-be Mary Pickford (1892-1979)—another box office sensation of the silent era. Whenever the younger Fairbanks was in California during his teens, he resided at Pickfair, the 18 acres estate in Beverly Hills where his father lived with his stepmother: they were both considered Hollywood’s uncrowned royalty, making Young Doug the undisputed Hollywood prince. Keeping their box office charts in mind, the Fairbankses ranked among the most popular screen stars of the silent era.\n\nDouglas Fairbanks’ ratings in the list of top money making stars looked like this (year followed by his rank): 1916 8; 1917 1; 1918 1; 1919 2; 1920 4; 1921 2; 1922 2; 1923 3; 1924 4; 1925 5; 1926 8; 1927 13; 1928 17.\n\nMary Pickford’s ratings were as follows: 1912 12; 1913 15; 1914 3; 1915 2; 1916 2; 1917 4; 1918 2; 1919 3; 1920 6; 1921 1; 1922 1; 1923 4; 1924 7; 1925 4; 1926 7; 1927 23; 1928 18 (source: Quigley Publishing Company).\n\nPickfair was located at 1143 Summit Drive, Beverly Hills; the mansion was demolished in 1990 for which then-owners, actress Pia Zadora and her husband, faced harsh criticism—including from Mr. Fairbanks—although to this day there are still a few remaining artifacts, including the front gate to the estate, the pool, and the pool house.\n\nIn those days, he witnessed his father filming “Robin Hood” (1922), and during the weekends, he visited with his friends the massive medieval sets on the backlot of the Pickford-Fairbanks studios on Santa Monica Boulevard. “After we had played touch football or softball, we’d come out and go climbing around on the sets when nobody was watching,” Mr. Fairbanks said.\n\nHe then spent a year in Paris with his mother, where he saw Sarah Bernhardt on the stage on the closing night of her final play. ‘An impressive event,’ he remembered, and although he had no real ambition of becoming a screen actor like his father, he was lured into films by Paramount founder, executive, and producer Jesse L. Lasky, who offered him at age 13 a staggering $1,000 a week for his screen debut “Stephen Steps Out” (1923). The film wasn’t quite successful, so Lasky did not pick up another option. ‘Later on, he signed me up again for $100 a week and suggested I’d do anything that came along,’ Mr. Fairbanks said.\n\nHe fared much better with films as “The Air Mail” (1925), playing the juvenile lead with Mary Brian, opposite Warner Baxter and Billie Dove. “At the time, I was only 16 and wasn’t old enough to realize who Billie Dove really was, or whether she was a good or a bad actress. But I remember she was very beautiful and nice to me,” he said. His next film, Henry King’s original film version of “Stella Dallas” (1925), based on the popular novel by Olive Higgins Prouty, seemed to be a major step forward. In this solid ‘woman’s movie,’ he portrayed the charming society lad who married Stella Dallas’ daughter at the end of the film—this was the famous scene when Stella, forlorn and forgotten, stands outside in the rain, watching the wedding ceremony through a window. ‘Henry King was an impatient, but very good director and his instructions were clear and precise, almost like a schoolteacher,’ Mr. Fairbanks said.\n\nStill, he accepted any part that came his way. In between acting assignments, he wrote titles for two silent films at $250 a picture and was test director on “The Gaucho” (1927), his father’s last large-scale costume film starring Lupe Velez, who later became known as the Mexican Spitfire, and Mary Pïckford in a cameo as the Virgin Mary (this sequence is not included in the final film, but the footage has survived and was preserved in 2005 by the George Eastman House).\n\nMr. Fairbanks got his first straight leading role in Frank Capra’s “The Power of the Press” (1928) at Columbia, then a scrawny Poverty Row company ran by Harry Cohn. ‘He was known to be coarse, vulgar, egocentric, and brutal, quite the opposite of Jack L. Warner, for example. He too was a tough businessman, but he was relaxed and kind and could tell jokes.’\n\nWhat about the other studio moguls, like Louis B. Mayer? ‘He was the most powerful and most dictatorial of them all. I’m glad I only worked there occasionally because I would have been terrified. Irving G. Thalberg [Mayer’s head of production from 1925 until he died in 1937] was quite the opposite: he was a brilliant and sympathetic man and easy to work with. Maybe also because he was married to [MGM actress] Norma Shearer, which probably gave him an inside view from another perspective.’\n\nOne of the MGM films that Mr. Fairbanks referred to was Clarence Brown’s “A Woman of Affairs” (1929), shot when he became more ambitious and emerged as a star. He played Greta Garbo’s younger brother, opposite John Gilbert and Lewis Stone. The film proved to be another triumph; on the set, he was the go-between, delivering messages from John Gilbert to ‘G.G.’ as their on-and-off relationship continued throughout the shooting of this film (in all, Garbo and Gilbert appeared in four films together).\n\nThat same year he married actress Joan Crawford; both were promising young actors, and MGM quickly capitalized on their union, pairing them in “Our Modern Maidens” (1929), one of his final silent films. ‘The coming of sound never bothered me. In fact I was looking forward to it,’ Mr. Fairbanks said, ‘nor did it bother my father or my stepmother. We all had theatrical experience, my father had been on the stage for several years, so there was no need to be worried.’\n\nAs he adjusted to sound easily, Jack L. Warner offered him a long-term contract, and a string of very interesting films were coming up. Among them were Howard Hawks’ “The Dawn Patrol” (1930), a fascinating story of a beleaguered British air squadron in WW1 France, co-starring Richard Barthelmess, and “Little Ceasar” (1931), one of Warner Bros.’ most prestigious gangster films about a small-time hood who becomes an underworld big-shot (Edward G. Robinson portrayed Caesar Enrico Bandello, Mr. Fairbanks played a gigolo). ‘Eddie Robinson got typecast as the tough guy, but no gentler man ever walked on this planet. He hated being villainous, but it paid so well that he was able to acquire one of the finest private collections of modern art,’ Mr. Fairbanks remembered.\n\nOn the strength of these films, Warner Bros. offered him a new contract and gave him more creative input, which resulted in excellent performances in some of the best films of the decade, including “Morning Glory” (1933), starring Katharine Hepburn as the stagestruck young woman who tries to succeed in New York (she earned her first of four Academy Awards for her performance), with Mr. Fairbanks co-starring as a young playwright, and in “Catherine the Great” (1934), he played Czar Peter III opposite Elisabeth Bergner in the title role. Said Mr. Fairbanks, ‘”Morning Glory” was a smashing success. Although I performed my assignment as well as I could, most people have forgotten that I played a leading role in the film. The Hepburn tidal wave also swamped Adolphe Menjou. Kate was so great in every way that I really didn’t mind, but Menjou was as mad as one of his elegant hatters. Kate and I became great friends, and I still keep in touch with her over the phone.’\n\nAs for the British-made “Catherine the Great,” Mr. Fairbanks remembers, ‘I have seldom had a character part as fine as Czar Peter III, and I think I rarely performed any part so well. In retrospect, I think some scenes were clearly but subconsciously influenced by my admiration for John Barrymore.’\n\nHis marriage with Miss Crawford ended in 1933; as he looked back, he said, ‘Joan set a good example with her dedication and conscientiousness for her work. Even when she was a star, she took voice lessons and drama courses. She always wanted to improve herself; she never sat back or took her success for granted.’\n\nOn the other hand, after his divorce, he and his father became very close for the first time. Over the years, his father took little interest in his son’s career, and Mr. Fairbanks Jr. carved his own way through the Hollywood jungle, with all the advantages and disadvantages of bearing the same name as his illustrious father. In 1933 his father had separated from Mary Pickford, and by January 1936, they were divorced. Two months later, he married Lady Sylvia Ashley and announced his retirement from acting. On December 13, 1939, he died in his sleep of a heart attack at age 56 in his Santa Monica home. In the late 1930s, both father and son discussed the possibilities of appearing in a film together, dealing with the story of Alexander the Great, but unfortunately, it never happened.\n\nMr. Fairbanks Sr. was not only the silent screen’s most beloved hero; he was one of the 36 founders of the Academy of Motion Picture, Arts and Science and was elected the first AMPAS president from 1927 until 1929. ‘My father originally shared the idea of the Academy with Louis B. Mayer. He wanted to give serious recognition each year by investing the money derived from the tickets for the ceremony in further motion picture research and development. When the annual events began to show signs of becoming vaudeville shows that encouraged film companies to lobby for their own products, he objected and protested, but to no avail. He then stopped trying and retired to a comparative back seat,’ Mr. Fairbanks said.\n\nIt is also very striking that, while several less notable figures were honored (actors, cameramen, writers, etc.), his father was entirely overlooked by the Academy, as were Chaplin, D.W. Griffith, Garbo, John Barrymore, Marlene Dietrich, and so many others. Mr. Fairbanks Jr. commented by saying, ‘A few months after my father had passed away, he was posthumously honored with an Oscar with the inscription ‘Commemorative Award Recognizing the Unique and Outstanding Contribution of Douglas Fairbanks—First President of the Academy—To the International Development of the Motion Picture—1939.’ I always thought the citation was inadequate and far beneath what he had achieved, and most importantly, it was only considered after his death. Despite all this, the Oscar still stands on a table in my apartment. As I’m speaking with you now, I’m looking at it.’\n\nIn the meantime, Mr. Fairbanks’ career in films continued successfully; he left Warners in 1934 to freelance, making several pictures in England before scoring another triumph as villain Rupert of Hentzau in David O. Selznick’s elaborate remake of “The Prisoner of Zenda” (1937). Mr. Fairbanks, ‘My part was so good, my father had said that nobody had ever failed in it and that Lassie, the dog, could even play it. He was right.’ Of all five screen versions (1913, 1922, 1937, 1952, and 1979), this one was the most brilliant one, with Ronald Colman and Mary Astor in the other leading roles.\n\nTwo years later, he co-starred with Cary Grant and Victor McLaglen in George Stevens’ masterpiece “Gunga Din” (1939), regarded by many as the ultimate Hollywood action-adventure picture then, focusing on three soldier-comrades in 19th century India. ‘I was under contract at RKO to do one more picture. One day Cary Grant asked me if I wanted to play in something called “Gunga Din,” inspired by Rudyard Kipling’s “Soldiers Three.” When I asked him which part he intended to play, he answered, ‘Whichever part you don’t want.’ He just wanted us to be together in this so badly. He said, ‘I think the two of us, plus old [Victor] McLaglen as our top sergeant, will make this picture more than just another big special.’ We finally settled the matter by tossing a coin. That’s how I became Sergeant Ballantyne, who wants to leave the Army for Joan Fontaine, and Cary became Sergeant Cutter. Until he died, Grant and I always addressed each other as Cutter and Ballantine,’ Mr. Fairbanks remembered.\n\n“Gunga Din” (1939, trailer)\n\n“Gunga Din” was shot in the California desert at Lone Pine, where the setting was much like India’s Northwest Frontier. For years the film’s running time was 96 minutes, until it was archivally restored to 117 minutes.\n\nDuring the 1930s, Mr. Fairbanks had an enormous film output. From 1930 until 1935, he appeared in 25 films—mostly leading roles—but, as he said, there was a reason for that. ‘The studios had to make enough films to supply their theaters. Many theaters needed two feature films, and they changed every week. So the studios had a big production schedule, and several of them had to turn out one picture every week.’\n\nOther noteworthy action-adventure films following the success of “Gunga Din” include “Rulers of the Sea” (1939) about the first steamship voyage across the Atlantic, and “The Sun Never Sets” (1939), a delightful drama of two British brothers, played by Mr. Fairbanks and Basil Rathbone, who are trying to prevent the outbreak of World War 2 in Africa. Last but not least, before he went on active duty for the U.S. Navy, in “The Corsican Brothers” (1941), he played a delightful dual role of swashbuckling twins who are separated but spiritually are still tied.\n\nAfter this film and six weeks before the attack on Pearl Harbor, he joined the U.S. Navy and left behind his wife Mary Lee and daughter Daphne, as well as a flourishing career in Hollywood. He served with great distinction as a Lieutenant Commander aboard USS Washington and the cruiser USS Wichita; he was also sent on a special mission to Malta aboard the aircraft carrier USS Wasp and participated in several combined Anglo-American operations. For his services, the war hero received numerous medals and decorations, among others the Legion of Merit, the Italian War Cross for Military Valor, the French Legion d’Honneur, and the Croix de Guerre, the Distinguished Service Cross and Belgium’s Order of the Crown. In 1949 the British knighted him for ‘furthering Anglo-American amity.’\n\nAfter the war, just a few days before he was formally demobilized and permitted to wear civilian clothes again, he and his wife attended a dance in a tent hosted by skating star Sonja Henie. There he met his former wife Joan Crawford again for the first time in years. As his friends all said to him, ‘Ah good, you’re back, safe and sound!’—he expected her to say a similar word of welcome. As she embraced him warmly, she said, ‘Darling! I suppose you haven’t heard, you don’t know, do you? I’m no longer with MGM. I’m with Warner Brothers now!’ Nevertheless, he was welcomed by Hollywood with open arms.\n\nHis first film after the war, “Sinbad the Sailor” (1947), which in many ways reminded of the early silent films, was based on the original “Arabian Nights” story. Mr. Fairbanks said, ‘”Sinbad” was indeed like a silent film, with lots of action and adventure. There were many ballet movements in the film; I even had a ballet teacher coaching me on many of them.’ With his title role, measuring up to the flamboyance required to make Sinbad a fictional hero and adopting some of his father’s larger-than-life gestures and mannerisms, he made the film hugely successful, and after several years of absence, he was immediately back on the right track.\n\nHowever, after producing, co-writing and appearing in Max Ophuls’ “The Exile” (1947), the romantic action thriller “The Flying O’Flynn” (1949), and another box office winner “That Lady in Ermine” (1948), a musical directed by Ernst Lubitsch (who died during production which Otto Preminger finished without any break in style), Mr. Fairbanks’ interest in filmmaking began to wane. ‘Because of the war, I had been away for many years. When I came back, a lot had changed, the audience had changed, new actors were coming up, so it was a different time,’ he said.\n\nBeing a genuine and avowed Anglophile, he and his family moved to England, where he resided until the early 1970s. Through his own production company, he produced, hosted, and often appeared in the successful TV anthology series “Douglas Fairbanks Jr. Presents” (1952-57). Each of the 117 episodes ran for half an hour, but they took several weeks to prepare, and they were all shot at Elstree Studios near London. Each episode could take anywhere from two to four days to shoot.\n\nOne episode in particular, “The Awakening” (1954), reunited him with Buster Keaton. They worked together in the Hollywood-shot French-language version of “The Passionate Plumber” (1932, a.k.a. “Le plombier amoureaux”), with Keaton in the leading role and Mr. Fairbanks producing the film. ‘I don’t remember too many details. I just remember doing it. I am bilingual, and as a company gesture, MGM asked me if I could do a picture in French.’\n\nMr. Fairbanks had met Buster Keaton several times before, but they were not closely acquainted. ‘I had known him only slightly. It was at the time of his marriage to Natalie Talmadge. Later, when he agreed to act in “The Awakening,” I got to know him better, but I never had the good fortune to know him really well.’ Buster Keaton was married to Natalie Talmadge from 1921 till 1932; she was one of the three Talmadge sisters, all leading actresses during the silent era (the others were Norma and Constance).\n\nMr. Fairbanks then moved back to the U.S. (first to Florida, then New York), appeared on the stage (including “My Fair Lady,” 1968-69), and he made one more film, “Ghost Story” (1981), a horror tale based on Peter Straub’s bestseller, with contemporaries Fred Astaire, Melvyn Douglas, and John Houseman.\n\nBeing a diplomat for several decades, he served on the Council of Foreign Relations since 1959 and has frequently lectured around the world. His second wife Mary Lee Epling was known for her work with hospice organizations and a dedicated sponsor of charity benefits. In 1991 he married home shopping network merchandiser Vera Shelton.\n\nAs I said, Mr. Fairbanks was a real survivor. He always remembered and appreciated Ms. Pickford’s unselfish attempts to bring both father and son Fairbanks together in friendship, and in the 1990s, he lost close friends, such as Charles ‘Buddy’ Rogers (Mary Pickford’s husband from 1937 until she died in 1979), Marlene Dietrich, and Greta Garbo. At the end of our interview, Mr. Fairbanks told an interesting anecdote, when he drove Garbo home one night after they were invited to a party hosted by German actor Emil Jannings; that was at the time when they made “A Woman of Affairs” (1929) at MGM. She had too much to drink, and when he took her home, he thought, ‘Here is my chance?’ But, as he said, ‘She was very nice, so I behaved like a gentleman, and when we arrived at her home, I only whispered, ‘Good night.’’\n\n“A Woman of Affairs” was Ms. Garbo’s seventh film out of the twenty-six she made while in Hollywood. By then, she was already at the height of her power and was well-protected by MGM. Mr. Fairbanks, ‘When we were on the set, and it was almost five o’clock in the afternoon, she usually walked up to the director and told him, ‘I tired. I tienk I go home.’ And nobody on the set was willing to argue with her.’\n\nAs a New York resident in his final decades, Mr. Fairbanks still went out frequently, went to the theater, and followed what was going on in the film industry—a business that certainly may be grateful for the enormous contribution he and his family made over the years and which goes back to the days when film was still at its infant stage—over a century ago.\n\nDouglas Fairbanks Jr. died May 7, 2000, at age 90, at a New York hospital following a heart attack. He was survived by his third wife and his three daughters from his second marriage to Mary Lee Epling (their union lasted from 1939 until she died in 1988, at age 76).\n\nHe was interred at the Hollywood Forever Cemetery on Santa Monica Boulevard, Hollywood, in the same tomb as his father.\n\nPhone interview\n\nAugust 1999\n\nFILMS\n\nAMERICAN ARISTOCRACY (1916) DIR Lloyd Ingraham SCR (story by Anita Loos) CAM Victor Fleming CAST Douglas Fairbanks, Jewel Carmen, C.A. de Lima, Albert Parker, Artie Ortego, Douglas Fairbanks Jr. (Newsboy [uncredited])\n\nTHE THREE MUSKETEERS (1921) DIR Fred Niblo PROD Douglas Fairbanks SCR (adaptation by Edward Knoblock; book “The Three Musketeers” [1884] by Alexandre Dumas) CAM Arthur Edeson ED Nellie Mason MUS Louis F.
