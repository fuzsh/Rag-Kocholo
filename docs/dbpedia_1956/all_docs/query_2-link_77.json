        "text": "When Jean-Luc Godard dedicated his first feature, “Breathless,” to Monogram Pictures, he was thumbing his nose at the critical establishment of 1960. For most of the Anglo-American film writers of the time, it was a self-evident truth that nothing but trash could come from a cash-starved studio like Monogram, with its constant flow of micro-budgeted genre pictures. An important movie required major stars, an acclaimed director, an epic scale and a socially significant subject, qualities conspicuously — almost aggressively — absent in Monogram productions.\n\nToday, thanks in no small part to Mr. Godard and his colleagues at the magazine Cahiers du Cinéma, the pendulum has swung quite far in the opposite direction. Web-fueled cults have sprung up around movies with even less cultural cachet and budgetary heft than the products of the Poverty Row studios. In the meantime, much of the Monogram library has dropped out of distribution, leaving today’s young Godardians to wonder why the master would dedicate his freshman effort to a studio whose only accessible titles consisted largely of juvenilia — B westerns, forlorn Bela Lugosi vehicles, dim Bowery Boys comedies.\n\nThough much of the studio’s earlier output has fallen into the public domain, and some titles from the 1940s have passed into the hands of MGM/UA, most of the post-1947 Monogram library is now being administered by Warner Brothers. (The Warner holdings also include most of the movies made after Monogram changed its name to Allied Artists in 1953 in an attempt to reconfigure itself as a higher-end operation. After a trio of A-level productions in the early ’70s — “Cabaret,” “Papillon” and “The Man Who Would Be King” — Allied Artists backed away from filmmaking. The company still exists, although it is now mainly involved with music.)"
