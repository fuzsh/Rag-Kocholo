A seaplane load of suspicious characters lands in Balboa, arriving from Cristobal on the Atlantic side of the isthmus. Among the group are British novelist Clivedon Compton, Miss Sarah Finch, a schoolmarm from Chicago, sinister scientist Dr. Rudolph Grosser, cabaret owner Emil Manolo, singer Kathi Lenesch, tobacco store owner Achmed Halide, US government engineer Richard Cabot, and American government agent R. J. Godley.\n\nUpon landing, Godley goes to a Panama hat shop that is owned by Fu Yuen, who is actually Charlie Chan, working for US intelligence. Godley, seeking Chan’s help to identify and capture a deadly spy and saboteur known as Reiner, suddenly dies just as he was about to give the Oriental detective some valuable information. Chan must now work on his own to expose Reiner before the spy can sabotage the Panama Canal, thus trapping the US fleet.\n\nChan, still in the guise of Fu Yuen, is taken to jail because of the suspicious death of Godley in his shop, where he finds his second son, Jimmy, who has gotten himself arrested on suspicion of being a spy. Once out of jail, father and son work together to solve the mystery of Reiner’s identity and save the fleet.\n\nTwo other suspects are killed; first Compton in his hotel room, and later, Manolo, who was on the run from the police.\n\nWhile searching for clues at a cemetery, Charlie Chan, Jimmy, Miss Finch, and Captain Lewis, a US intelligence officer, become trapped in a tomb. While in the tomb, a number of large empty cans are discovered. Chan determines that the cans contained a very high explosive, which he now feels will be used to destroy the channel. After hours of being trapped, the group finally makes its escape and hurries to the Miraflores locks which, Chan has determined, have been targeted for destruction at ten o’clock that night.\n\nCONCLUSION:\n\nAs the hour of destruction approaches, all personnel at the Miraflores powerhouse are evacuated. Before the group of suspects can exit the facility, Chan stops them, holding them all at gunpoint. With each passing minute, individuals in the group become more overcome with fear. Finally, as the fateful moment arrives, the murderer, in a desperate attempt to escape, pulls out a gun. To the surprise of most everyone, Miss Finch reveals herself to be Reiner. As she flees through a door, she is captured by authorities who were waiting outside, obviously privy to the plot of Charlie Chan, who had shortly before discovered and disarmed the explosive device.\n\nNOTES: Charlie Chan in Panama provides a glimpse at the stresses experienced by the United States in the stages that led to the eventual entry of our nation into World War II. At this point, the United States was “neutral” in the war which had already begun in both Europe and in the Far East. We note the hints throughout the movie as to the identities of the hostile nations, although no definite references are provided in the interest of appearing neutral. Film footage containing sequences of US Navy warships, including the USS Arizona and USS Lexington passing through the Panama Canal, is seen in this picture.\n\nAdapted from: AMERICAN FILM INSTITUTE CATALOG – Within Our Gates: Ethnicity in American Feature Films, 1911-1960\n\nCHARLIE CHAN’S APHORISMS\n\nThousand friends too few.\n\nOne enemy one too many.\n\nMan without relatives is man without troubles.\n\nAbsence of proof open cell door.\n\nPerhaps better to let cat out of bag than drown same.\n\nWhen prepared for worst, can hope for best.\n\nYoung brain, like grass, need dew of sleep.\n\nTruth wins more friendship than lies.\n\nBad alibi like dead fish – cannot stand test of time.\n\nNo heart strong enough to hold bullet.\n\nGun can be made to talk.\n\nMarks left by gun barrel on bullet like fingerprints.\n\nFeatures familiar as markings on bad penny.\n\nNerves make time crawl backward.\n\nDividing line between folly and wisdom very faint in dark tomb.\n\nPatience lead to knowledge.\n\nCaution much safer than daring.\n\nTime bomb without electric arteries cannot speak.\n\nIntelligent defense of nation best guarantee for years of peace.\n\nOTHER WORTHY STATEMENTS:\n\nIn Panama, walls equipped with eyes as well as ears. (To RJ Godley)\n\n(Jimmy: “How’d you know it was me?”) Frequent spankings have made favorite son’s anatomy most familiar. (Following his slapping Jimmy on his behind him after having seen him only from that position)\n\nGodley and Reiner play cat-and-mouse game, and mouse strike first. (To Governor D.C. Webster)\n\nIf [canal] lock does not function, battleship caught like fish in trap. (To Governor DC Webster)\n\nVery difficult to smile. Death visit my humble shop today. (To Manolo, spoken as Fu Yuen)\n\nOn the soil of democracy you are safe from persecution. (To Kathi Lenesch)\n\nInside pocket like vault of National Bank. (To Kathi Lenesch)\n\nGun can be made to talk. (Regarding the comparison of “rifling marks”)\n\n(Miss Finch: “Why, it’s your son!”) Features familiar as markings on bad penny.\n\nEven in graveyard, they are forgettable angels and fools. (To Miss Finch and Captain Lewis regarding Jimmy)\n\nLike actress intoxicated by success, lady overplayed part. (To all, regarding Miss Finch)\n\nREVIEW\n\nVariety, February 21, 1940\n\nThis latest Chan whodunit is a real chiller and ranks high among the many turned out. Picture definitely tags Sidney Toler as worthy of carrying on the role that the late Warner Oland made a screen fixture. There’s less of that slow-motion delivery Toler showed before. He makes it a distinct characterization even in the face of alert competition from ‘honorable No. 2 son.’ Production has patterned for enough time on the screen to fill out a double-feature bill, where it will lend strong support.\n\nExhibitor should not overlook the story’s timeliness, centering about a plot to destroy part of the Panama Canal and trap the fleet going through on maneuvers. Added to this is a long array of continental spies.\n\nScripters John Larkin and Lester Ziffren have skillfully fastened suspicion on six different characters and then made the discovery of the mysterious German spy, Ryner, the seventh and long-sought suspect. They have done this without permitting too much of it to seem unreasonable. Fable is vastly helped by Norman Foster’s direction, former screen player apparently having won his spurs in directing. He has fashioned a whole series of suspenseful moments without making the developments seem ludicrous.\n\nToler dominates every scene once he’s introduced working for the army intelligence disguised as a hat store proprietor. He is tremendously effectual in the well-conceived climax when the destruction of the canal locks seems to hang on his ability to force a confession from one of five suspects. Sen Yung makes the ‘No. 2 are’ highly important character.\n\nJack La Rue, as a nightclub operator and one of the menaces, contributes probably his best recent performance. Frank Puglia, another suspect, is good. Jean Rogers, as the Czech refugee showgirl, adds a nice minor role while Mary Nash, as the supposedly innocent schoolmarm, chips in with a topflight portrayal.\n\nFILM NOTES\n\nDATE: July 15-16, 1939 (Saturday and Sunday) (Evidence: The date written on RJ Godley’s Trans-Panama Air Line ticket – “7-15”)\n\nDURATION: Two days\n\nLOCATIONS: Panama City, Panama, and Balboa, Panama Canal Zone\n\nTHE SIGN SHOW NEAR THE DOCK IN CRISTOBAL:\n\nTHE WORDING ON FOUR CRATES SEEN ON THE DOCK:\n\n“MARINE EXPORTING CO.\n\nCRISTOBAL\n\nPCZ”\n\n“SANG HOP CO.\n\nCRISTOBAL\n\nPCZ”\n\n“YEE SING CHANG CO.\n\nBALBOA\n\nPCZ”\n\n“CHINA HOUSE\n\nCRISTOBAL\n\nPCZ”\n\nTHE SHIP THAT WAS BEING PHOTOGRAPHED BY THE ENEMY SPY ON THE DOCK: USS Indianapolis (CV-35)\n\nTHE NAME OF THE AIRLINE USED TO TRANSPORT PASSENGERS WITHIN THE PANAMA CANAL ZONE: Trans-Panama Airways\n\nTHE ORIGIN OF THE TRANS-PANAMA AIRLINES FLIGHT: Cristobal\n\nTHE DESTINATION OF THE TRANS-PANAMA AIRWAYS FLIGHT: Balboa\n\nTHE ARRIVAL TIMES FOR BALBOA, ACCORDING TO THE POSTED SEAPLANE SCHEDULE FOR TRANS-PANAMA AIRWAYS:\n\n“AM 9.30\n\nPM 3.10″\n\nMISS FINCH’S STATED PROFESSION: “For eighteen years I’ve been teaching the students of Chicago the mysteries of algebra and geometry.”\n\nTHE NAME OF THE PERSON FOR WHOM SR.
