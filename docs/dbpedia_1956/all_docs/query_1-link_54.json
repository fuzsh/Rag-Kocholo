Ed was born in Green Cove Springs, FL on February 26, 1958. As part of a Navy family, grew up in several places, but called Norfolk, VA home. Ed graduated from Maury High School in 1976 and went on to receive a B.A. in Philosophy and Religion from Virginia Wesleyan College and his Masters of Divinity from The Theological School at Drew University.\n\nEd served as the associate/youth pastor at Christ UMC in Lakewood, NJ until 1983. He served under full-time appointment for more than 40 years in the Virginia Annual Conference of the United Methodist Church. He was first ordained as a Deacon in 1982 and was ordained as an Elder in 1998. His first church was Joliff UMC in Chesapeake where he served there until 1989. He also served Beth Horon UMC in Natural Bridge Station (1989-98), Parrish Court UMC in Covington (1998-2004), Zion UMC in Zion Crossroads (2004-06), Main Street UMC in South Boston (2006-16), Ivy Creek UMC in Charlottesville (2016-22), and Verona UMC in Verona (2022-24).\n\nEd was passionate about serving others and impacted many lives throughout his ministry. This included cofounding the Natural Bridge/Glasgow Food Pantry in Glasgow and the Jane Jones Food Pantry at Main Street UMC in South Boston, participating in countless service projects and mission trips, and serving on the Board of Directors for Virginia United Methodist Family Services, the Virginia Conference Commission on Disabilities, and, for ten years, as the chairs of the district Committees on Ministry for the Farmville and Charlottesville districts.\n\nEd is survived by his loving wife of over 44 years, Susan, son, Thomas Rigg, and husband, Wayne Berry, of Louisa, VA, daughter, Rebekah, husband, Brad, and grandchildren, Hadley and Calvin Pennington, of Strasburg, VA, brothers Jim Rigg of Jacksonville, FL, and Richard Rigg of Chesapeake, VA, sisters, Cherryl Hartman and Pat Rodriguez, of Virginia Beach, VA and a host of cousins, nieces, nephews, and friends.

Lee High School in Columbus, MS. In 1973, he received an Associate’s Degree from Wood Jr. College. He received a Bachelor’s Degree in Psychology from Mississippi State University in 1975, a Master of Divinity from Duke University Divinity School in 1978 and a Doctorate of Divinity from St. Mary’s Seminary and University in Baltimore, MD in 1981.\n\nIn the mid 1970’s, Jim was cast as comic strip character Lil’ Abner by Al Capp Enterprises executives for the amusement facility in Northwest Arkansas. This was a key development in Jim’s career in public presence. After his time at “Dogpatch”, Jim became the emcee for Tina Turner and other musicians including, the late, great Elvis Presley. From here, Jim went on to fulfill his lifelong dream of being a ringmaster in various circuses.\n\nWhile enjoying a successful entertainment career, Jim felt the call to the Methodist ministry. He returned home to Columbus and prepared to enter Duke University Divinity School. While studying at Duke, Jim met Avis and they were married Aug. 6, 1977. As he would say, it was “Love at first sight, love at last sight”.\n\nJim’s first appointment was in Garysburg, NC, serving a three point charge. After finishing at Duke, he was appointed to the Rocky Mt., VA two point charge. He then became the Associate Pastor at Martinsville United Methodist Church. After two years, Jim was appointed to a vacant lot at the corner of Lauderdale and Gayton Roads in Short Pump, VA to begin a new United Methodist Church. Discovery United Methodist Church began on Easter Sunday, 1984 and for 33 years, Jim Lavender served as the senior pastor.\n\nUpon news that Jim had answered the call to the ministry, friends from the circus world began reaching out to inspire him to do “something different” as he ministered to children. It was here that the Thank God For Kids ministry was born. Beginning as a series of children’s sermons at Discovery, adopted animals reached over one million children across the United States for Christ, with the help of Jim, his family, and countless volunteers from Discovery. Among these sermons, Jim illustrated the concept of Peace on Earth by having “Bubba” the lion and “Lucky” the lamb lie down together.\n\nUpon Jim’s retirement in 2016, “Bubba” continued to serve the community of Louisa County as the live mascot of the Louisa High School Lions at the request of the late Coach Mark Fischer. In 2018, Jim was asked to serve Corinth Methodist Church in Goochland County where he served for five years. His final appointment was made September of 2023 to serve Macedonia Methodist Church in Louisa County. Jim preached his final sermon on June 2, 2024, but continued his support and guidance of the ministry at Macedonia until his death on July 12, 2024.\n\nAcross a storybook lifetime, “Dr. Jim” always showed a love of kids and became a “big friend to little people” wherever he went. Jim remained faithful to his Call, loved his family and spread the Love of Christ to all he touched.\n\nVisitation for friends and family will be held Thursday, July 18, from 2 to 4 p.m and 6 to 8 p.m. at Bennett’s Funeral Home (11020 W. Broad St., Glen Allen, VA). Funeral services will be held at 11 a.m. on Friday, July 19 at Discovery United Methodist Church, 13000 Gayton Road, Henrico, VA. Interment will follow at Macedonia Global Methodist Church at 3 pm. (17 Byrd Mill Rd., Louisa, VA).\n\n(Source: Bennett Funeral Home)\n\nDee Dawson Nichols completed her earthly life on June 22, 2024, after a long illness. The middle daughter of Charles and Margaret Dawson, Dee was born in Duryea, PA, where she lived until graduating from high school. Her next stop was Asbury College in Wilmore, KY, where she earned her B.A. degree in English and met her future husband, Hugh, the great love of her life. Hugh, who played violin, found out that Dee played the piano. They met when he asked her to accompany him for a violin performance. After college, they married and eventually moved to Eagle Rock, VA, where Dee taught school and Hugh was a pastor.\n\nGiving her life to Jesus Christ at the age of 15, Dee led many others to Christ through her example and Bible teaching. She had a tender heart for those who were suffering and went out of her way to help those in need. She freely offered to God’s glory her gifts as a pianist and children’s choir director throughout her husband’s itinerant ministry. In the Roanoke area, Dee led three large choirs for children and youth at both Melrose Ave. Methodist in the sixties and Central United Methodist Church in Salem in the seventies.\n\nWhile singing was always a passion, Dee had many other gifts. She taught piano lessons out of the home to many students, including her daughter, Sherrie. She was an excellent cook, marvelous hostess, meticulous housekeeper, and sewed many of her children’s clothes. When the family moved to Buena Vista in the late sixties, Dee started teaching English at Parry McCluer High School. A later move to Salem found Dee teaching at Glenvar High School and then at Salem High School, serving as department head for a number of years at both. Her reputation was that of a tough, yet caring teacher. She prepared her senior students so well for college English classes that they would come back and thank her for all she had done to help them excel. During this time, she completed her Master of Arts degree at The University of Virginia, focusing on creative writing. She remained an avid supporter of UVA sports for life.\n\nAs if life were not full enough, Dee found time to dabble in all kinds of crafts, including wreath-making, painting, stained glass projects, and doll-making, to name a few. She loved raising plants and flowers and enjoyed being in a garden club. Dee was a wonderful mother who loved her children well. She and Hugh served as enthusiastic cheerleaders for all their children’s activities.\n\nFollowing retirement, Dee and Hugh lived at Smith Mountain Lake for a time before settling in Daleville, VA. They eventually moved to The Glebe Retirement Community, where Dee enjoyed serving as a pianist, participating in the Legacy Program with local school students, being a Glebe Ambassador, and leading sing-a-longs in Assisted Living and Health Care for many years.\n\nOne of Dee’s favorite Bible passages offers us great hope as we look to the future: “…though our bodies are dying, our spirits are being renewed every day. For our present troubles are quite small and won’t last very long…but the things we cannot see will last forever.” (2 Corinthians 4:16-18, NLT)\n\nDee was preceded in death by her parents, her sisters Evelyn Walters and Norma Dawson, her husband Rev. Hugh E. Nichols, and an infant son. Surviving are her children, Sherrie Andrews (Clarke), Perry Nichols (Susan), and Terri Bradbury, seven grandchildren, Kirk Andrews (Bethany), Keelah Andrews Voll (Eric), Elise Nichols, Katelyn Nichols Cunningham (Landon), Brent Bradbury (Liz), Shelly Bradbury (Alex), and Staci Bradbury (Casey). Dee is also survived by nine great-grandchildren: Paxton, Wade, Avie, Vallie and Susanna Andrews, Eliza and Esmae Voll, and Hudson and Sawyer Cunningham. Online condolences may be expressed at www.Oakeys.com. Friends and family are invited to a Memorial Service to be held at St. Mark’s United Methodist Church, 19 Cedar Ridge Dr., Daleville, VA 24083, on Saturday, July 6, 2024, at 11AM.

Gant, 93, passed into the arms of his Lord and Savior on November 29, 2023, in Lynchburg, Virginia. Ed was born on July 23, 1930, in Newell, West Virginia. He was the only child of Pearl Gant and Goldie Gant. He is survived by his devoted wife of 65 years, Louise Gant and their three children; Doug (Liz) Gant, Debbie Barry Schmitt, and Libby (Tim) Roberts. He is also survived by his 7 grandchildren and 1 great-grandchild; Alexandra Schmitt (Ben) Norwood, Caitlin Roberts, Jonathan Schmitt, Christopher Schmitt, Anne Gant, Camden Roberts, Grayson Roberts, and Charlotte Norwood.\n\nAs a young man, Ed felt a strong call to Christian ministry and began pastoring a small church in the mid-1950s. During this time, Ed attended a Church of the Nazarene delegate event in Huntington, West Virginia, where he met Louise Clark. They spoke briefly and saw each other one other time before he volunteered to serve in the United States Army – accepting what he believed was his responsibility. Ed served in the Army in Germany from 1955-1957. He returned home in August of 1957 when he met Louise again. They were soon married on January 4, 1958 in Moundsville, West Virginia.\n\nHis call to ministry would lead him and Louise to spend their lives in service to the Lord, and to the communities in which they lived. First, serving small churches in West Virginia, and then serving for 39 years as a minister in the Virginia United Methodist Conference for churches across the state. In addition to pastoring churches, Ed was involved with Industrial Commercial Ministries (ICM) where he spent time in the field riding with officers of the Fairfax & Danville Police Departments. He also served as a member and Chaplain of the Virginia Defense Force. When Ed retired from full time ministry in 1995, he and Louise settled in Lynchburg, Virginia and became active members of Heritage United Methodist Church where they would continue to serve their church and support other local churches when needed.\n\nOver the years, Ed’s engagement in the communities he served outside of the church, included being part of the local Masonic Lodge and membership in both the Scottish Rite and Shrine Club. His interests also included all things photography. Ed loved taking pictures and as technology evolved, he was always excited to embrace new ways to capture special moments, the images of the people he loved, and the places he visited.\n\nEd and Louise led an active life together loving their children, grandchildren, and their many church families. He was privileged to officiate many weddings and baptisms over the years, but it was his special joy to be able to officiate the weddings of his three children, baptize his seven grandchildren, and most recently officiate the wedding of his granddaughter, Alexandra.\n\nEd had a true servant’s heart and was devoted in his service to the Lord and to sharing the gospel. He genuinely loved those he ministered to, was willing to see the good in people, and was never hesitant to share his time or pray with them.\n\nA memorial service will be held at 1 P.M on Thursday, January 4, 2024 at Heritage United Methodist Church. The internment will be private for his family. In lieu of flowers, donations may be made to either Shriners Hospitals for Children and/or Heritage United Methodist Church Lynchburg Virginia.\n\nRev.

Welborn was preceded in death by his father, Walter and youngest brother, Douglas.\n\nWesley considered his family and the lives he touched through his ministry inside and outside the church as his greatest accomplishments. He and Becky were a month shy of 53 years in marriage. His daughter, Kathleen, followed in his footsteps and also became a UMC pastor. His son, Jonathan, graduated from West Point Military Academy and served in the United States Army for 20 years rising to the rank of Major before retiring and returning to civilian life with his family this fall. Both children have been married for 20 years or more and are raising grandchildren that Wesley was deeply proud of and blessed by. His last day was spent sharing a homemade meal with his family and enjoying giving thanks for all God’s blessings.\n\nA native Texan, born in Corpus Christi, in 1949, Rev. Welborn graduated from Victoria High School. After graduation, he attended McMahon School of Stenotype in Houston. From there, Wesley was appointed Official Court Reporter of the 145 th Judicial District Court in Nacogdoches. There his best friend, Randy Warren, introduced him to Becky Lock at the Stephen F. Austin State University United Methodist Wesley Foundation.\n\nThey married in Elkhart in 1970. In 1971, Wesley had a powerful experience of God’s grace and love in Christ Jesus. He prayerfully asked for and received the call to dedicate his life to preaching and teaching about that love and grace. Wesley entered into ministry in the Texas Conference of the United Methodist under appointment to Smith Chapel Circuit in Mineola on February 1, 1972. He was ordained an Elder in the United Methodist Church in 1980.\n\nRev. Welborn preached and served as a minister for 50 years, 44 years under appointment in the Texas Conference retiring in June of 2016. He then served the Conference for two more years as an Intentional Interim Minister. After he and Becky moved to Virginia to live with their daughter and son-in-law, both UMC pastors in the Virginia Conference, he assisted and persisted in ministry for four more years in extension ministry in the Shenandoah River District. Wesley finally stepped out of the pulpit for health reasons in 2023, but even then, he carried on with teaching a Sunday School class as often as his health allowed.\n\nRev. Welborn’s appointments were as follows: Smith Chapel Circuit (‘72-’75), First UMC, Texas City (‘77-’78), Colfax Circuit (’78-’79), Beckville UMC & Allison Chapel (‘79-’82), First UMC, Bryan, Associate (’82-’88), St. John’s, Baytown (’88-’91), Van UMC (’91-’94), First UMC, Center (’94-’00), First UMC, Brenham (’00-06), Chapelwood UMC, Lake Jackson (’06-’12), First UMC, Port Neches (’12-’16), Fields Chapel UMC, Palestine, Retired (’16-‘18), Mt. Zion UMC, Brief Interim (’18), and Honorary Associate of Strasburg UMC, Strasburg, VA (’19-’22).\n\nWhile serving as an Associate Pastor at Bryan FUMC, Wesley, continued his love of learning by earning his D.Min. from McCormick Theological Seminary in, Chicago, Illinois. His thesis was on Reviving the Dying Church.\n\nIn addition to his work inside the church Rev. Welborn chose to give of his time to community organizations in each place he lived. He has been a member of various Lions and Rotary clubs all his life. Rev. Welborn also wrote weekly newspaper columns for various town papers and in Center, TX gave weekly radio devotionals. He frequently served on boards for local community development organizations, foundations, and charities.\n\nIn his spare time, Wesley enjoyed staying physically active. Sports he enjoyed included: racquetball, tennis, kickboxing, pickle ball, and yoga. He was often seen walking for miles through whatever pretty landscapes were near his home. It was on one of these walks that he found retirement buddy, Smokey, a small, blonde puppy that eventually grew to almost three feet from head to foot.\n\nThe hobby he became passionate about after his children left home was raising orchids. He was a member of the Orchid Society in Lake Jackson and continued this hobby until the climates of where he lived no longer promoted orchid growth.\n\nA favorite pastime for Wesley was playing Sid Meier’s Civilization series of games, which he introduced to his children and grandchildren over the years, though none of them will ever eclipse his level of play.\n\nA funeral service for Rev. Welborn will be conducted at 11:00 a.m. Saturday, December 2, 2023 at Strasburg United Methodist Church. A luncheon will follow in the Fellowship Hall.\n\nRev. Welborn’s Texan friends, family, colleagues and congregants are invited to attend a memorial service for him held on January 13, 2024 at 11:00am in the Peace Chapel at Lakeview Methodist Conference Center in Palestine, Texas. Internment will be at the Texas Methodist Conference Cemetery at Lakeview.

Wesley was a compassionate and generous man who gave to many charities throughout his life including, his local United Methodist Church, the United Methodist Committee on Relief (UMCOR), the Leukemia Society, Huntington’s Disease Society of America, etc.\n\nRev. James Welford (Jim) Thornton, Sr. died peacefully at home on October 2, 2023, after a long, hard-fought battle with cancer and kidney disease. Jim is survived by his wife, Sandra Benson Thornton; son, James W. (Jay) Thornton, Jr., and wife, Natalie; daughter, Julie T. Hull and husband, Tim; beloved grandchildren, Sarah Anne Hull, Rachel Elizabeth Hull, Eryn Delaney Thornton, Macauley Grace Thornton, and Zachary Holman Thornton and wife, Kim; sister, Ann T. Simmons; sister-in-law, Catherine Thornton; several nieces and nephews; and a host of cousins. Jim was predeceased by his parents, Thomas Holman and Evelyn Harris Thornton; wife, Carol Rogers Thornton; and brother, Thomas Holman Thornton, Jr.\n\nJim grew up in Highland Park in Richmond and was a proud member of the Corps of Cadets at John Marshall High School, from which he graduated in 1963. He attended Virginia Tech and Richmond Professional Institute (RPI), being awarded a Bachelor of Science degree in Sociology and Social Welfare from RPI, followed by a Master of Social Work degree from Virginia Commonwealth University. Jim enjoyed a career in the Virginia law enforcement and criminal justice systems followed by service in the federal system as a U. S. Probation Officer until 1991, when he responded to a call to ordained ministry in the United Methodist Church (UMC). Jim’s first appointment was to a 3-point charge as a student-pastor in Accomack County on Virginia’s Eastern Shore, serving churches in Saxis, Sanford, and Hallwood. He also served Drummondtown UMC and Woodberry UMC in Accomack. Jim later served Macedonia UMC in Louisa County and Byrd Chapel UMC in Fluvanna County, a 10-year appointment. Jim retired from Ivy Creek UMC in Albemarle County in 2016 after serving that congregation for nine years. His Master of Divinity from The Wesley Theological Seminary was conferred in 1995. Among the many things for which Jim will be remembered are his commitment to the gospel of his Lord, Jesus Christ; his humble strength; his calm but firm leadership; his wisdom and encouragement; and his compassionate, reassuring presence. And his sense of fun and humor and love of fishing, movies, music, and singing with the men’s chorus!\n\nA Service of Death and Resurrection will be held on Saturday, October 28, 2023, at Woodward Funeral Home, 200 Fredericksburg Ave, Louisa, VA 23093, at 2:00 p.m with the Rev.

Following graduation from Tangier Combined School, Al enlisted in the United States Army. He was stationed in Germany during the Korean Conflict and assigned to the 804th Military Police Company. In 1954, he was honorably discharged and began working as a statistical agent for the U.S. Government, and later as Chaplain in the Reserve Defense Force, having served his country for 16 and a half years. Al was immensely proud of his time in the military. He was a longtime member of the VFW and remained an advocate for all veterans throughout his life.\n\nMark 16:15 – He said to them, “Go into the world and preach the gospel to all creation.” The military was a close second to his greatest passion, ministry. Always one to lend a hand to someone in need or offer a listening ear to those in turmoil, the Lord chose Al to spread the Word long before he even knew his path. He received his undergraduate and completed seminary at Duke University, and later, received his Doctor in Divinity from Oxford, ultimately serving more than 32 years as an ordained minister in the United Methodist conference. His calling to save souls led him to pastor many congregations over the years, which led to many lifelong friendships with his brothers and sisters in Christ. He was a member of Andrew Chapel United Methodist Church, where he enjoyed attending service with his wife, Ardis.\n\nRev. Pamela Lynne Clark-Egan’s wish to find true freedom in death in the name of Jesus Christ was granted unexpectedly October 2, 2023. She is survived by her husband of 40 years Timothy; her son Robert Allen Ranger Egan and his wife Kaitlyn and granddaughter Delaney; her daughter Danielle Davis and her husband William (Bill), son Reed, and their three daughters Amanda, Peyton and Ainsley; her daughter Katelyn Dunford and her husband Brenden, their daughter McKenna, and son’s William and Jamie; her sister Betty-Anne Clark Roberson and her husband Kenneth (Ken), and their daughters Christine, Kendi & her husband James, Molly, Megan and her partner Shawn and their twin daughters, Amelia and Aria; her sister from another mother Pamela Appleton; and her sister Kathy Sue Clark-Gainous, her husband Marty and son Brett Jarnigin.\n\nShe was born December 31, 1953, in Tazewell (Virginia). She and her mother Phyllis Jean Ranger lived with her Grandparents Robert & Florence Ranger in Falls Mills (Virginia) until she was nine; for a short time near Tampa (Florida), then in the DC area (Arlington, Fairfax & Temple Hills) until she and Tim were married on July 23, 1983, when they began raising their family in Alexandria (Virginia).\n\nPamela graduated at the top of her class from the Federal Law\n\nEnforcement Training Center in 1975 before becoming an officer with the Metropolitan Transit Police. She left that career to raise her family, then in response to her call to ministry, she graduated from George Mason University in 1999 before earning her Masters of Divinity at Wesley Theological Seminary in 2000, and becoming an elder with the United Methodist Church (UMC). She served the Clarendon UMC community as a seminary student before being assigned in 2002 as the pastor of Sleepy Hollow UMC in Falls Church (Virginia) until 2019, and as a temporary pastor at the Trapper Creek (Lutheran) Fellowship in 2012 and 2022. During the course of her clergy service, she was privileged to participate in the ordination ceremony for a Presbyterian pastor, and delivered sermons at Lutheran, several non-denominational churches, and a Baptist church. On a trip to Ephesus (Turkey) at an amphitheater where Paul preached, she served communion with Tim, Pamela Appleton & Bonita. Under her guidance many UMC mission teams worked in Pocahontas (Virginia) performing household repairs, assisting the Pocahontas Baptist Church with their Vacation Bible School, and purchasing Christmas gifts that were delivered without attribution by the Catholic sponsored Christian Action Center.\n\nPamela & Tim developed a love for cruising late in life, accumulating almost two months onboard in the Mediterranean, the Baltic, a Transatlantic trip and the Caribbean. She particularly liked the ship’s itinerary listing a “sea day” because that meant she and her friend Bonita Mills read that as a “spa day”. Her favorite vacation was spent staying for a week in a “cave house” carved into in caldera in Oui, Santorini (Greece). She & Tim were on their way to visiting all 50 states by reaching 34, along with 26 countries. Her desire is for him to continue traveling and distributing some of her ashes wherever he goes.\n\nPamela was passionate about ministering to the police, establishing a “police room” at Sleepy Hollow UMC to provide a quiet and secure respite for the officers complete with snacks. In the course of her travels, she usually sought-out the country’s officers for a “photo-op”, some conversation, and a prayer for their safety.\n\nThe family will receive friends on Saturday, October 7, 2023, from 11:00 A.M. – 2:00 P.M. at Baker-Post Funeral Home & Cremation Center, 10001 Nokesville Road, Manassas, VA 20110.\n\nA Celebration of Life Service for Rev.

Feeling drawn to the ministry, he studied at Emory University’s Candler School of Theology and earned an M.Div. degree from Drew University. Seeking yet broader theological understanding, he was research assistant for a year for Professor William Barclay, the distinguished Scottish theologian at the University of Glasgow. He went on to earn a Doctor of Sacred Theology degree at Emory University and a PhD. in higher education administration at Georgia State University, and continued his studies at the Harvard University Institute for Educational Management.\n\nOn returning from Scotland, he was ordained as elder in the South Georgia Conference of the United Methodist Church. Over the next 12 years he served churches in Macon, Centerville, and St. Luke United Methodist Church in Columbus. In Cuthbert, Georgia, he was pastor of the church, and served Andrew College as chaplain, teaching Old and New Testament, and serving on the Board of Trustees and its executive committee. Recognizing his leadership skills, which were enhanced by his pastoral spirit, Andrew College tapped him for the presidency in 1980. His dramatic success as Andrew’s president led to him being called to Brevard College where he served as president for seven years (1985-1992). In 1992 he assumed the presidency of Virginia Wesleyan College, a small, young, liberal arts college in Norfolk/Virginia Beach. Under Greer’s 23 years at the helm, Virginia Wesleyan notably increased its enrollment, athletics program (earning the coveted ODAC Commissioner’s Cup in 2014-15), physical facilities, and endowment. One of his proudest achievements at Wesleyan was the establishment of the Center for the Study of Religious Freedom. He was often heard to say, “We must stop killing each other over religious beliefs.” The Greer Environmental Sciences Center was given in honor of his retirement, fulfilling his dream and placing Wesleyan in a unique position among liberal arts colleges. Following his retirement from Virginia Wesleyan he served for 18 months as interim president of the Eastern Shore Community College, where he enjoyed the diversity of the students and the academic programs. His gifts as a dynamic leader were recognized by his peers, and they selected him as President of Leadership Georgia and for leadership positions in many educational associations, including The Virginia Foundation of Independent Colleges, the National Association of Independent Colleges and Universities, the Commission on Colleges of the Southern Association, and the National Association of Schools and Colleges of United Methodist Church. He was among a select group of college administrators invited to participate in a Fulbright Scholars Program in Germany.\n\nAs a young man Billy Greer met and fell in love with Fann Dewar, the love of his life. Their 58-year marriage was a true partnership. He was a devoted husband and father to their three sons, William Thomas, III (Carrie Meade), Robert Dewar (Rachel Simmons), and David Benjamin (Amanda Womble). He was so proud of the men his sons became and of their families: grandchildren Meade Alison Greer (studying at Virginia Commonwealth University), William Thomas Greer, IV and Martin Dewar Greer of Roanoke VA, and Polk Truan Greer and Watson Parker Greer of Chapel Hill, NC. In addition to his wife and children he is survived by his sister Linda Greer Burton (Joe) of Raleigh, NC, brother-in-law Robert Y. Dewar, Jr. (Sarah), their wonderful families and loving cousins. His family was his greatest joy.\n\nAlways a visionary, he believed in building community, often around breaking bread. He famously used the barbecue grill as a site for fund-raising as well as a place to nurture closer relationships with colleagues, students, and family. At the institutions he led, many students, faculty and staff members were touched by his personal interest and acts of kindness. A lifelong sports enthusiast, Billy Greer especially loved rooting for sports teams at both Brevard and Virginia Wesleyan, sometimes leading student cheers at basketball games. His love of sports grew from his own long athletic experience playing basketball, which continued into college. At the University of Glasgow he was awarded Full Blue Colors, the highest athletic award given in British Universities.\n\nAs a man of high moral character, Greer faced decisions with a clear sense of right and wrong. He loved relating to people regardless of their station in life. He was on the front lines of pushing racial equality in the student athletic church league in Brevard and the Old Dominion Athletic Conference. He was interested in and accepting of all people. Humble and gracious, he drew people to his side with his boundless energy, unpretentious ways, ability to empathize, love of a good story, and tremendous sense of humor—how Billy Greer enjoyed a good laugh!\n\nGraveside services will be held at 11:00 AM on Saturday, September 2 at Calvary Episcopal Churchyard in Fletcher, NC with a picnic to follow at the Deerfield Community. A memorial service will be held at Christ and St. Luke’s Church in Norfolk, VA. on October 14, 2023 at 10 a.m. followed later in the day by a celebration of life at Virginia Wesleyan University.

Thelma Irene McCarty O’Quinn was a resident of the Hermitage in Richmond, Virginia, where she passed gently and gracefully on August 18th, 2023. Persons who encountered Thelma often commented on her regal appearance, positive attitude, self-effacing demeanor, and good listener. She was an active churchgoer, award-winning knitter, orchid grower, maker of Christmas decorations, and she made thousands of Chrismons for churches and personal use. Later in life she constructed and gave away over 300 beaded angels as signs of appreciation and encouragement to women around her.\n\nThelma Irene McCarty O’Quinn was born May 15, 1930, at Ishkooda Mining Camp which was on Shannon Mountain near Birmingham, Alabama. Thelma was born to her parents, Ernest L. McCarty, Sr. and Nettie Irene Shaw McCarty.

She graduated from Jones Valley High School in 1948. She was an active member of Powderly Baptist Church until she followed her husband into the Methodist Church to support his call to preach. A retired civil service employee, Thelma transferred jobs multiple times for the sake of her husband’s ministry through the United Methodist Church. She also worked for TCI in Birmingham, Alabama Farm Bureau, The University of Alabama, Bessemer Junior College, and US Steel before becoming a federal employee in 1971.\n\nA Witness to the Resurrection will be held at J.T.

He was diagnosed with cancer earlier this year.\n\nGene was born in 1945 to Carroll Douglas Thomas and Viola (Strigle) Thomas of Gloucester, Virginia. He was preceded in death by his parents and his wife, Linda (Bing) Thomas. He is survived by his wife, Amanda Lee Thomas of Arlington, Virginia; his brother, Carl Douglas Thomas of Moon, Virginia; his two children, William Douglas Thomas of Richmond and Gloucester, Virginia and Jennifer Thomas Martin of Inwood, West Virginia; his five grandchildren: William Douglas Thomas, Jr., Christopher Ryan Thomas, Lyndsay Page Thomas, Jed Thomas Adams, and Danielle Wolfrey; and seven great-grandchildren.\n\nHe was a graduate of Christopher Newport College with a B.A. in Philosophy in 1979, Virginia Union University School of Theology with a Master of Theology in 1983, and Boston University School of Theology with a Doctor of Ministry in 1993.\n\nGene started his professional work as an entrepreneur, a part owner of M&G Transportation in Gloucester, Virginia. There wasn’t a truck driving down Virginia highways that he didn’t love nor a trucking company that he wasn’t familiar with. He relished contributing to his family business and helped build up the business model until the Lord called him into ministry.\n\nGene entered the ministry from Salem United Methodist Church in Mathews, Virginia, and was ordained a United Methodist deacon in 1982 and an elder in 1985. He pastored churches in the Northern Neck, Winchester, Alexandria, New Market, Virginia Beach and Arlington. He served as an assistant on the Rehoboth Charge, consisting of Bluff Point, Wicomico, Rehoboth and Mila United Methodist Churches. He pastored the Northern Frederick Charge, consisting of Rest, White Hall and Mount Pleasant United Methodist Churches. He served as the senior pastor of Kernstown, Lincolnia, Manor Memorial, Thalia and Clarendon United Methodist Churches. He retired from the ministry in 2014. In addition, he was active in the Emmaus community.\n\nAs a man of God who loved to worship, Gene appreciated many forms of worship including high church, contemporary, Taize and others. He was eager to share his vast knowledge with anyone who loved to worship the Lord. Because he had an artist’s eye, Gene appreciated and incorporated many artistic elements into his worship including using a church’s architecture to highlight elements of worship. He also had a special place in his heart for men’s ministry.\n\nAfter his retirement, Gene spent much time serving as a member of the Virginia Society of Sons of the American Revolution (VASSAR), serving as a past state chaplain and as a past president of the George Mason Chapter. He also served as a past president of the Kiwanis Club of Arlington, a docent at the Washington National Cathedral in Washington, D.C., and a member of both the Chesapeake Chapter of the United States Lighthouse Society and the Washington Golf and Country Club. He preached the word of God for Rick Bonfim Ministries and enjoyed having the time to paint.\n\nHe was a devoted husband, first to Linda and then to Amanda. He was a devoted father and PawPaw to his beloved grandchildren and great-grandchildren. He was a dapper, fastidious, and meticulous man. He wore his formidable intellect lightly and preferred to be known as a country boy. Gene was a man who was born in a small, rural town but relished traveling the world to see his favorite art. Above all, he was a gentle man, who loved and was loved.\n\nA funeral service will be held at 10:30 a.m. on Friday, August 25, 2023, at Clarendon United Methodist Church. A reception will follow at noon at the Washington Golf and Country Club.

Don was born on June 30,1961 in Roanoke, Virginia to his parents, Robert Baldwin and LouAnn Guzi.\n\nHe was preceded in death by his grandparents; Robert and Margaret Baldwin, Carl and Margaret Andrews; and his brother, Tim Baldwin. Don was a dedicated husband, a loving father, a phenomenal friend and most of all, a Man of God. Don was called to serve in the ministry in many areas in his life. He began as a youth pastor, worked with Young Life and finally became a Methodist minister, where he was blessed to serve many churches in the Roanoke Valley. He also served on many Emmaus Walks and Kairos teams over the years.\n\nDon was deeply loved by many, and forgotten by none. He never met a stranger and had a deeply infectious laugh. He was a die-hard Washington Redskins fan, a master scuba instructor and a cigar connoisseur. He loved his wife, children, grandchildren and his family. He also loved his greyhound Bryce, who he never got over when he passed.\n\nDon and Jackie loved to travel, going on several cruises to the Caribbean, where they found peace. Don even scuba dove the Bermuda Triangle. They were fortunate to go to Israel, Scotland, and several places throughout the US.\n\nDon is survived by his wife and high school sweetheart of 39 years, Jackie Baldwin.

As the oldest daughter of a Methodist minister, where Rev. Parker was called to serve, so went the family. Amelia relocated to Richmond VA where her father pastored her beloved Leigh Street Methodist Church. She considered Richmond to be her home and she was not too fond of the idea of moving to Baltimore MD when her father was appointed to the Baltimore-Washington Annual Conference, it was in Baltimore where would meet the love of her life.\n\nShe attended Frederick Douglass Senior High School and graduated in 1963, ranked 3rd in her class, and was a proud member of the last class to graduate in February. Immediately after graduating high school, she briefly attended Morgan College, now known as Morgan State University. Her best friend since high school Carolyn Moore, was instrumental in introducing Amelia to Luther Grant Bond II. Amelia would lovingly recall how Carolyn was “insistent” on them meeting and how she reluctantly agreed to do so. It was the best decision she made and the rest was history; Amelia and Luther fell in love and were married July 4, 1963 at her family home where her father officiated the ceremony.\n\nAmelia and Luther made their home in Baltimore and raised their oldest three daughters Yolada, Melanie, and Judith there. Luther would be called to ministry and became an ordained United Methodist minister in 1976. Amelia would move again now with her United Methodist minister husband and family to southwestern Virginia. From 1976 until Rev. Bond’s untimely death in 1989, he and Amelia pastored three churches that made up the former Smith Mountain Charge: Halesford UMC, Mt Zion UMC, and New Ridgeway UMC. In 1984, their youngest daughter, Allyson was born.\n\nAmelia would go on to make her home in Roanoke VA where she was a member of St Paul UMC and Columbia MD where she became a member of Locust UMC with her two youngest daughters until she moved back to Penhook VA in 2002. She returned to St Paul UMC where she picked up where she left off singing in the choir. She captivated many churches and venues with her melodious singing; she was frequently asked to sing solos and sing with many different choirs. Her beautiful voice will always be remembered; we rejoice knowing she is now singing with the heavenly choir. Up until her illness, she made it a point to attend the churches of Mt. Zion and New Ridgeway. She would attend Greater Mt Parrish on fifth Sundays. She fried pies for the Lord’s Acre and participated in events and activities such as Black History Month presentations. In addition to her talent as a singer and reading music, she also enjoyed painting, drawing (as a child, she wanted to become a fashion designer), playing the keyboard, completing cryptograms, and being an uplifting supporter of many communities she came to know and love.\n\nShe is preceded in death by her infant brother Richard Parker, her parents Rev. Hilton A. Parker and Nellie Parker, mother-in-law Joy Bond, the love of her life Rev Luther G Bond Jr. father-in-law Luther G. Bond Sr. and special cousin who was like a sister, Margaret A Johnson.\n\nLeft to cherish her precious, sweet memory are her daughters Yolanda B. Thompson (Paul), Melanie B. Johnson (Jerry), Judith Amelia Bond, and Allyson B. Bracey (Brian); her grandchildren Bernadette Amelia Johnson, Jerry N. Johnson, II, Brittnay Amelia Mae Bond (Theodore R. Thaxton, father), Bethany M. Thompson (Kirk), Hilton G. Johnson, and Mallory L. Thompson; her great-grands Elena Bond-Cordew, Laura G. Croft (Zachary L. Croft, father) Devin E.

He was born in Bowling Green, Virginia to Reverend Richard R Burnett and Mary Allen Lee Burnette, the first of their three children. He was married to Carol Ravndal Burnette for 66 years. A lifelong learner, he received a Bachelor of Arts degree in Psychology from Randolph-Macon College after a stint in the U.S. Navy, a Bachelor of Divinity from the Candler School of Theology at Emory University, a Master of Arts from the Richmond Professional Institute of the College of William and Mary in Applied Psychology and an Education Doctorate in Research and Testing from Florida State University. Contrary to popular belief, he did NOT graduate from Jones Jr. High in Toledo (his students will understand).\n\nHe taught for 52 years at Florida Southern College (FSC) where he developed the Testing Center, the Counseling Center, the Nursing Program, and the Criminology Program. He served as Psychology Department Chair, Social Science Division Chair, Coordinator for Institutional Research, Director of Psychological Testing, and the Director of Student Disability Services.\n\nWhile at Florida Southern he was instrumental in forming the Florida Association for Institutional Research, provided norming data for the first CLEP credit by exam test, consulted with the College Board for over 20 years, and edited the National Newsletter for Ministerial Assessment Specialists. He was the chapter secretary for Omicron Delta Kappa, a student leadership fraternity, for which he won the national leadership award. Twice he was awarded the FSC Teacher of the Year Award, the second at the age of 81, and was recognized for teaching excellence by Omicron Delta Kappa, the Sears Roebuck Foundation, and United Methodist Church Board of Higher Education. He coordinated campus-to-church relations, hosting many high school church groups on their visits to FSC, for which he won the John Wesley Church Relations Award. He also served in several professional organizations including Phi Eta Sigma, Alpha Phi Omega (President), Phi Delta Kappa, Chi Beta Phi, Psi Chi, and Phi Gamma Mu.\n\nHe was an exceptional teacher, who mentored both students and staff and entertained them with his stories, wit, and occasional pranks. He taught students the Jones Junior High song, how to speak ant, how he got his children to eat spinach, and was known for riding his bicycle or unicycle to class or teaching with a flying squirrel in his jacket pocket.\n\nOrdained in the Virginia Conference of the United Methodist Church (UMC), he served his entire tenure as a missionary to FSC, sent to serve the needs of students. He did so in abundance. He also served as the Coordinator of Ministerial Assessment on the Board of the Ordained Ministry for the Florida Conference of the UMC for four decades. A lifelong member of the BYKOTA class at First UMC in Lakeland, he taught Sunday School and attended “religiously” until his passing. An avid Boy Scout and outdoorsman, he hitchhiked to Philmont Scout Ranch from Virginia and took his scout troop canoeing on the Hudson Bay. He attained the rank of Eagle Scout and earned the Order of the Arrow from the Boy Scout Council. Most notably, his scouts captured his future bride along the parade route in Richmond to be the queen of their float. The consummate scout, he took his family on numerous adventures including tent camping around the country and especially in Cherokee, NC. He also led FSC’s canoe trips around Florida for over four decades and rafted the Colorado river in his late 50’s. He had notable horticultural skills, earning him the most improved yard of the year in Lakeland and he created two new fern species.\n\nA true child of the depression, he was known for driving his iconic 1956 VW Bug for over 52 years. Eventually he sold it to his mechanic for a dollar. His backup vehicle was his sister’s 1961 VW Bug. He also enjoyed sports, leading the Faculty Fossils in softball and volleyball, and supporting FSC’s exceptional varsity sports programs. He was a recognizable, if not vocal, fan(atic). He wrote a chapter in Lake Hollingsworth, Reflections and Studies on a Florida Landmark and the stories were mostly factual. He was never one to let the truth get in the way of a good story. He was proud of the plaque on his office door that said, “Office of Embellishment.”\n\nDr. Burnette is survived by his wife Carol Ravndal Burnette, daughters Renée Burnette (Jim Coble), Randi Burnette Sinclair (Mark), and sons Richard R “Rick” Burnette III (Lois) and Robert B “Rob” Burnette (Jane). His grandchildren are Kathryn “Katy” Harrington (Scott), Caroline Dervan (Chris), Nicolas “Nick” Burnette, Allison Burnette, Rachel Sinclair, Andrew Sinclair, and Sydney Sinclair, and great-grandson Benjamin Harrington.

After the service, the family will welcome friends. In lieu of flowers, memorial donations to the Richard R Burnette, Jr. Scholarship Fund may be made to Florida Southern College.\n\nTo the best of our knowledge the above information is correct although some is the product of his oral history, so we will never know. We know that he was a phenomenal storyteller. Just ask any of his 5,000 students about him and they will recount a story he told – a true measure of his teaching talent and relatability.\n\nSource: https://www.heathfuneralchapel.com/obituaries/Rev-Dr-Richard-Rome-Dick-Burnette-Jr?obId=27765051\n\nWilliam Curtis Logan Jr, 83, passed away in Roanoke, VA on February 15, 2023.

His first appointment was at Broadmeadow U.M.C. as an Associate Minister in Jackson, Mississippi. His second was with Wesleyanna U.M.C. and Monterey U.M.C. Charge as Minister in Star, Mississippi.

He enjoyed his boat, fishing and crabbing from his dock. He was the proudest of Grandfathers attending baseball games, field hockey games, softball games, golf tournaments, dance recitals, soccer games, basketball games, track meets, choral performances, and swim lessons.

He enjoyed taking conformation groups on exciting adventures from Lake Junaluska to the Washington D.C. National Cathedral. During his years of serving churches he performed many baptisms, both on infants and in more non-traditional locations, such as hospitals or even the Rappahannock River.

He continued performing these activities in his retirement, he stepped into many pulpits to allow ministers to take vacations or leave of absence for family matters. His most recent 8 month appointment in Warsaw was a delightful experience, during his time there he was blessed with another church family. There are numerous ways both small and large he touched people’s lives.

Everything they did, they did together. The started out in 1958 developing their “Team Ministry”, working and visiting together in their appointed church. Her organization skills proved to be invaluable to Bill. All of their appointed church reports to the Virginia Annual Conference were always Perfect and filed in a timely manner. Bill was always proud that they were debt free in their personal lives. She loved music and did everything in her power to make the music and message for Sunday mornings blend beautifully. Her laughter and the joy of life that she brought wherever she was, became a blessing to all who knew her. Kay loved her husband and her family. She knew what it was like to be a servant of God and proved it again and again. They both were an example of what it meant to live life everyday with grace, dignity, generosity and spiritual strength.\n\nKay appreciated her husband’s hobby of growing ‘roses’ and enjoyed them in the parsonages they lived in, and most of all the rose garden at their retirement home in Roanoke. They both loved their home in Roanoke. Their spoiled pet dogs: Waga, Blaze, Gold, Peppy, and Blondie; gave her and her husband much joy and companionship. Kay (and Bill) became well known to all of their many friends that created lasting and profound friendships in the neighborhoods in which they lived, and the churches where they served. Their “50th Wedding Anniversary Celebration Dinner” on March 15th, 2008, was evident when over 150 friends and former church members celebrated with them, hosted by their son and his family. She and Bill were active members of the Paul Coffey Sunday School Class. She was elected President of the class in 2012; and enjoyed serving on the Greeters, Readers, and Ushers Schedules: for the 11 o’clock Worship Services, attending the Wednesday Noon Services and the Fine Arts Programs at the church. She was asked to be a member of the Greene Memorial United Methodist Church Bell Choir in the fall of 2013. In 2016, she was asked to organize a “Bereavement Committee” at Greene Memorial United Methodist Church, to provide “Receptions following a Memorial Service at the church if the families wanted one.” Kay enjoyed serving the church as a Volunteer Greeter at the desk in the Welcome Center on Monday and Friday mornings. Kay enjoyed becoming a member of St. Mark’s United Methodist Church at Daleville, closer to their home in 2020. She became a member of the “Bell Choir” at St. Mark’s United Methodist Church in 2021.\n\nAfter a private viewing by the family, visitation will be at Oakey’s East Chapel on Alternate 220, Roanoke; on Wednesday, July 27th, 2022, from 6 to 8 PM.
