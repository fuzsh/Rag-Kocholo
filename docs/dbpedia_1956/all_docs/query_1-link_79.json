His family moved many times before coming to Montana, including living in Bremerton, WA during WWII. Their first home was in Miles City, coming to Sidney in 1949, where they became active members of Trinity Lutheran Church. After coming to Sidney, Bill’s joys included playing football for the Sidney Eagles as a defensive end and captain of the team, as well as being a member of the National Guard.\n\nBill began his own family in 1957, with his marriage to Sharon Ann Weiser in Hazelton, ND. Their family began with the birth of their son, Todd William, soon followed by Bret Alfred and Cindy Lynnae. Sharon and Bill fostered two other sons, Timothy Wade Mulholland and Joel Metrick. The addition of these two sons completed his family.\n\nBill had many hobbies which included raising dogs, wood working, fishing, playing cards, traveling, writing poetry, cooking meals, and making old fashioned ice cream with his special recipe for his children and grandchildren.

He assisted in construction of the current Trinity Church building by hauling many loads of brick from Hebron, ND to Sidney.\n\nBill was a successful entrepreneur in the new steel, hide, fur and recycling business, founding Border Steel and Recycling with his son Bret in 1985. He was very proud of this business and the fact that many family members have joined in the operation of it. Bill was a strong but gentle man known for his sense of humor and his love of family.\n\nBill died on Friday, February 2, 2018, in Sidney, MT.\n\nBill is survived by: Sharon, his wife of 61 years, his son Bret (Julie), his daughter, Cindy (Tom), his son Tim (Remona), his daughter-in-law, Sue (Roger); He was grandfather to Alissa (Randy), Jon (Megan), Becca (Jordan), Heather (Scott), Bryon (Tania), Brady (Ryann), Carla (Lee), Tanner, Danielle, Katyana (Jake), Tevis, Chelsie, Zach, and Skyler and great grandfather to 21; three sisters, Beverly Backer, Frankie Morrison, and Anna Mindt.\n\nHe was preceded in death by his parents, his son Todd, and his great-grandson Jamie.\n\nMemorial Contribution\n\nIf you would like to remember Bill, suggested memorials include Trinity Lutheran Church and Richland Opportunities, Inc.\n\nSign Guest Book\n\nPaul & Paulette Huber (Dickinson, ND)\n\ndoug hettich\n\nViolet Tharp\n\nMeg & Frank Hernandez (Miles City, Montana)\n\nSusan Zimmerman (Sidney , MT)\n\nEric Siegert (Fargo, ND)\n\nCathy Linde Hancock (Lancaster , California )\n\nTammy Linder (Sidney, Montana)\n\nKen & Karen Marohl (Grand Island, NE)\n\nBruce and Sandi Edwards\n\nDebra Gilbert (Sidney, MT)\n\nWillie & Jasmine Toler (Sidney, Montana )\n\nMarilyn Gawryluk (baker, mt)\n\nPrevious\n\nNext"
