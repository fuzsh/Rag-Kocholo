Margaret was a much younger woman on the make who entranced Chuck into marrying her. When Margaret is found shot to death, Harry is arrested for the crime but the more Perry digs into the victim's past the more convoluted things get.\n\nThe Case of the Wrathful Wraith\n\nThe attractive owner of a professional football team is accused of murdering her husband in a dispute over control of the team."
