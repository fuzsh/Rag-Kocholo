        "text": "I will never forget the first time my then-two-year-old looked at me with a cocked head and wide eyes and asked, “Mommy, who you texting?” Immediately mortified that the word “texting” had unintentionally wedged its way into her vocabulary, I put down my phone and pulled her close to me, taking in her baby scent and resting my head on her soft baby-blonde poof of hair. I wasn’t ready for her to understand technology then, and two years later, I’m not any closer to being less afraid for her future that will undoubtedly be saturated in phones, tablets, drones and pre-existing technology I can’t yet imagine.\n\nI am not a parent who thinks all technology is bad. In fact, I think the recent WHO recommendations for baring screen time completely for kids under two and limiting it to one hour per day for kids two to five is beyond ridiculous — it’s classist and sexist as well. My daughter watches television — not even the educational kind — when I need a break for whatever reason. I try to limit this to once per day, but it sometimes happens more often. When she was younger and I was working twelve to sixteen hour days, I relied on screen time more, because at the end of the day I just could not find the energy to entertain her.\n\nWe also utilize screen time as an educational resource. My daughter asks repeatedly to watch animal birth videos and I want to nourish her desire to understand how biology works. Since we are not going to adopt a pregnant giraffe any time soon, YouTube is our best resource. We’ve also Googled many of her typical four-year-old questions that I could not answer, including, “Where does my poop go when I flush it?” and “What are roads made of?”\n\nShe has, however, never owned or operated an iPad and she doesn’t use technology without supervision. So, if I’m not scared of technology, why do I have so many rules? As a Certified Nurse Midwife who specializes in women’s mental health, I have a professional interest in how technology and social media affects our mental health. Personally, as a woman who has lived with depression and anxiety and suffered from postpartum mood disorders, I know what it feels like to have suicidal thoughts. I am terrified that as my daughter ages, technology will no longer serve to answer her questions about the world around her, but instead make her ask questions about herself like, “Am I good enough?” or “Why don’t I look like that?” or “Why isn’t my life as interesting as everyone else’s?”\n\nLast summer, my best friend’s sixteen-year-old daughter Kala came to spend a week with our family. Admittedly, I haven’t spent a ton of time around teenagers since I was one, so perhaps I shouldn’t have been as shocked as I was that she was completely engaged with social media the entire week she was with us. It’s not that she was distracted — she was an incredible help with my daughter and talked with my husband and me about her plans for college, favorite bands and potential careers. I enjoyed every minute she was with us, but when she would retreat to her bedroom, she’d immediately pull out her phone and browse Instagram and Snapchat and instantly her mood would become somber.\n\n“I only spent six hours on my phone yesterday!” she said to me one morning as she marched into the kitchen for breakfast. “Only?!” I asked. “Compared to what?” She told me that her screen time monitor on her iPhone usually reports eight or nine hours a day spent looking at the screen. Throughout the week with us, she deleted and then later added the Instagram app to her phone at least twice. She’d scroll past a photo of a friend doing something that triggered her, like vacationing in Europe or simply hanging out with other friends without her, and vow to get off social media forever. An hour later, I’d see her thumb scrolling down with fury, after re-adding the app. I knew that she had been on antidepressant medication for about two years and that she had threatened to kill herself at least twice. All this information was beginning to come together for me to create a narrative of potential harm that frightened me.\n\nShe got her first phone at twelve years old and her first social media account at thirteen, when she was in eighth grade. If there is any more impressionable, sensitive and awkward year of your life than thirteen, then I don’t know what it is. Between 2010 and 2015, arguably the years it became socially acceptable as well as socially imperative for every teen to have a phone, the rate of girls in eighth to twelfth grade who had symptoms of depression increased 33 percent. During the same period, the suicide rate for the same group of girls increased 65 percent. The study that reported this data also reported that compared to girls who engaged in more social interaction like sports, school and print media, girls who spent more time on phones and social media were more likely to report mental health problems.\n\nKala returned home and over the summer her depression worsened. She had another blow up with her mom in which she expressed the desire to hurt herself. “What was the fight about?” I asked. “She didn’t want me to leave her alone on a Saturday night,” my friend told me. “She could see all her friends out having fun in pictures on Instagram. She said if I went out with my girlfriends she would stay home and kill herself.” Kala’s mom made an appointment with a new therapist that night and her psychiatrist upped her medications that week. I sent my friend a link to an online treatment program for social media addiction. “I’ll pay for it,” I told her, but I knew Kala wasn’t ready to be done with social media.\n\nI’ve lived with depression since I was a teenager and I have distinct memories of feeling suicidal during my 17th year. I know my depression stemmed from my need for independence and a change of pace from a rural town, so I promised myself that if ever I truly wanted to die, I would buy a plane ticket to Paris and live on the streets. I don’t know why this plan made any sense to me, but it probably had something to do with the fact that I had a few hundred dollars in my bank account and I knew how to call the airline to book a flight. Maybe the plan wasn’t entirely realistic, but it was doable.\n\nHow would things have been different for me if I could visit an online forum and find not only the recipe for a suicide cocktail, but the cheerleading support to go through with it? Last year Molly Russell, a 14-year-old who seemed happy and content to her parents, died from suicide. She was an active Instagram user and followed accounts that promoted self-harm. Instagram’s algorithm recommended similar self-harm accounts with graphic images, until Molly’s feed was a macabre reel of ways to harm a human body. Molly’s parents feel certain that Instagram is largely responsible for their daughter’s death.\n\nThe impacts of social media on suicide rates are now so prevalent that this epidemic is considered a public health issue. I experienced bullying on a pretty small scale when I was in the sixth grade. A couple of girls bullied me in gym class and another group of popular girls took me in then ghosted me and called me names when I was just out of ear shot. In 1994, the solution was simple. I switched schools in seventh grade and everything was pretty normal socially until I graduated high school. In 2019, there’s no such thing as changing school to evade bullies, who will find you online and send you harassing messages until in many cases, they have worn you down enough to hurt yourself. Teens who use social media are at an increased risk for suicide, but those who are cyberbullied are twice as likely to attempt suicide than those who aren’t.\n\nMy perfect little daughter has her head cradled in my armpit as I write this. She’s watching Cloudy with a Chance of Meatballs on Netflix. She’s sick with a cold and unable to go to preschool, so a movie is what it takes for me to get some work done. As she sits here fascinated by a character who can make it rain bananas and hamburgers, I know that I’m not worried about how watching this movie is impacting her brain. I know that she does art, gymnastics and spends hours a day outside. I know that I read her at least five books a day and take her to the library once a week. I’m not scared of screen time because I know that I protect her development in other ways.\n\nWhen she’s a teenager, I won’t discourage my daughter from using social media because of its unknown. I recognize that not all social media is evil and some formats will certainly prove to be useful to her, just as they have to me. LinkedIn is a breeding ground for recruiters and editors, many of whom have contacted me and provided me with paid gigs. Facebook sharing has led me to click on articles and join groups about positive parenting and child development, because who has time to read an actual parenting book once your child is born? Occasionally I am able to use Audible or Stitcher to listen to an audiobook or podcast in the car between bursts of Elmo and Abby Cadabby. Social media and technology have enhanced my life in many ways.\n\nHow can I ensure that my daughter interacts with social media and technology in ways that don’t impact her mental health negatively? I don’t know the answer. I’m so scared of her vulnerability and my inability to protect her from the thoughts in her own mind when she finally explores these platforms inflated with artificial versions of happiness. I know I can’t protect her from people who encourage her to harm herself, with intention or without, but I can raise her to love herself, her body and her ideas — or I can at least try really, really hard. For now, I’m just going to squeeze her tight and get her another lollipop for her cough."
