His secretary, Walter Dorn, is working undercover for the United States government. At the U.S. embassy, he begs Prentiss to send for Charlie Chan. The next day, Dorn is mysteriously shot during a luncheon party at Wyans’ home. Before he dies, he manages to type the following cryptic message: “TH E$M OST.”\n\nChan arrives in Mexico City, accompanied by Number Three Son Tommy and his chauffeur and assistant Chattanooga Brown. He meets an old friend, Inspector Luis Carvero of the Mexico City police with whom he had previously worked four years earlier while assisting the British government in Honduras. Luis tells him that no gun was found at the scene of the murder and that, although the guests heard only one shot, two bullet holes were discovered.\n\nChan tells Carvero that Wyans’ papers relate to the discovery of a new, 95th element that could be used to make a bomb much more powerful than an atomic bomb. Chan suspects one of the party guests, who include Marguerite Fontan, with whom Luis is in love; Edmund Slade, a former gunrunner; Joseph Bradish, an international smuggler; Countess Irena, a singer; and Charles Massack, a Nazi propagandist.\n\nAfter he questions the guests, Chan accompanies Carvero to the police lab and learns that the bullet that killed Dorn has no firing marks, indicating that it was not fired from a conventional gun. Wyans complains to the police that his typewriter has been stolen, and Chan warns him to protect his papers.\n\nLater, Chan disclosed that Marguerite had connections in Czechoslovakia, where the papers were stolen from the Allies by Wyans. While all of the suspects are at dinner, Chan and Carvero search Wyans’ baggage in the basement, but are interrupted by others who have the same idea. After the suspects leave, Chan and Luis discover the missing typewriter.\n\nWyans tells Massack that he knows how Dorn was killed, but as he tries to telephone Chan, he is shot in the same manner as Dorn. At the nightclub where Irena sings, Chan reveals that she is not nobility and that she is married to Charles Masack, who spies for several countries. Prompted by these revelations, Irena starts to reveal the secret, but she too is killed. Soon after, a similar attempt is made on the life of Charlie Chan.\n\nChan tries to discover why a bottle of red indelible Chinese “Red Dragon” ink was found on Dorn’s desk. He asks if there are any Chinese artists of note in Mexico City. Carvero mentions that there is one who frequents the many nightclubs in the city, seeking subjects to draw. Artist Iris Ling is found, who, it turns out, had visited Wyans’ apartment before his murder. She tells Chan that she had sold Wyans the ink to use on his banderillas which, Chan surmises, were actually his typewriter ribbons. Chan and Carvero return to Wyans’ home and retrieve the ribbon that Dorn had removed from the typewriter before he was killed. Upon inspection, it is discovered that the secret information is written on the ribbon in indelible ink.\n\nCONCLUSION:\n\nChan clears Marguerite from suspicion when he discloses that her uncle had discovered the secret new element. He then reveals that Dorn had attempted to type the word “THERMOSTAT” as he was dying, explaining that Bradish committed the murders, using a remote control device that was disguised as a thermostat that exploded devices containing a pair of bullets that he had secretly planted on his victims.\n\nNOTES: The film’s working title was Charlie Chan in Mexico. The title card reads “Charlie Chan in The Red Dragon.”\n\nAdapted from: AMERICAN FILM INSTITUTE CATALOG – Within Our Gates: Ethnicity in American Feature Films, 1911-1960\n\nCHARLIE CHAN’S APHORISMS\n\nEven detective sometimes fall in love…quite often with suspect in murder case.\n\nMurder is one way of discharging dangerous employee.\n\nPolice always dare to tell truth.\n\nPuppy cannot fool old dog.\n\nAssistants should be seen, not heard.\n\nGood detective always look for something unusual.\n\nHens sit often, but they lay eggs.\n\nMust repeat old police slogan: “Unusual thing always very good clue.”\n\nNothing ever entirely disappear – somethingalways remain.\n\nLike Chinese army, Chinese ink cannot be wiped out.\n\nThere is old saying: “Mother know best.”\n\nOTHER WORTHY STATEMENTS:\n\nPolice even read your thoughts. (To Charles Massack)\n\nNo one here seems to be what he or she pretend to be. (To assembled suspects)\n\nConfucius could give answer to that. Unfortunately, Confucius not here at moment. (In response to a question posed by Inspector Carvero)\n\nEveryone here trying to be too clever. (To assembled suspects)\n\nWhile you on job, good idea slightly impossible. (To Tommy, commenting on his “good idea”)\n\nThis never died – not even corpse – it is reasonable facsimile of you and you. (To Tommy and Chattanooga Brown regarding a dummy)\n\nNumber three son is thinking. Most unusual, but does not assist police. (To Inspector Carvero)\n\n(Tommy: “How about looking for something unusual, Pop?”) You always provide usual noise.\n\nElderly detective do elderly Rumba. (To Iris Ling)\n\nWhen I dance with charming lady, it makes me feel like youngster. (To Iris Ling)\n\n(Tommy: [regarding the typed “TH E$M OST” clue] “It still doesn’t make sense, Pop.”) It make sense if you use sense.\n\nNumber three son Tommy like rooster who think sun come up just to hear him crow. (To Inspector Carvero)\n\nThere is old saying: “Mother know best.” But perhaps in this case, it best mother know nothing whatsoever. (To Tommy who has just suggested that if his Pop will remain “quiet” to his girlfriend back home in Honolulu about his flirtations with artist Iris Ling, he will not tell his mother about his father having danced the rumba with the young Chinese artist)\n\nREVIEW\n\nVariety, January 2, 1946\n\nMonogram has entered the atomic bomb pix race with a stock detective trifle involving the vet Asiatic sleuth Charlie Chan. Pic isn’t a serious threat, the yarn being a draggy, obvious whodunit that will suit only nabe support.\n\nStory involves attempts to steal a scientist’s plans for an atomic bomb, with various mysterious characters gathered in Mexico City to lift the loot. One by one the assorted grifters are shot, with killer or weapon mysteriously absent. Chan finally discovers that the shots are fired by remote control from a launching device, and nabs the murderer, while ending the threat to the precious formula.\n\nA cosmopolitan cast goes through the motions. Sidney Toler enacting Chan in his usually placid way; Fortunio Bonanova playing a Mexican inspector; Benson Fong, Chan’s irrepressible son, and Willie Best, the comic relief as servant. Marjorie Hoshelle, as a nitery singer-suspect, handles a song well.\n\nProduction budget is modest and direction so-so.\n\nFILM NOTES\n\nPROBABLE DATE: Late fall 1945\n\nDURATION: At least a week, perhaps eight days\n\nLOCATION: Mexico City, Mexico\n\nMEXICO CITY LANDMARKS SHOWN:\n\nMetropolitan Cathedral\n\nBellas Artes Opera House\n\nPalacio Nacional (Parliament Building)\n\nPRENTISS’ JOB TITLE AT THE U.S. EMBASSY IN MEXICO CITY: First Attache\n\nTHE LOCATION OF ALFRED WYANS’ RESIDENCE: Hotel Miramar\n\nTHE REGISTRATION NUMBER ON THE PLANE ON WHICH CHARLIE CHAN ARRIVED IN MEXICO CITY: XAR 11\n\nTHE TYPE OF PLANE: Douglas DC-2\n\nTHE NAME OF THE AIRLINE: CMA – Compañía Mexicana de Aviación (commonly known as Mexicana)\n\nTHE ANSWER GIVEN BY TOMMY WHEN ASKED HIS AGE IN SPANISH BY INSPECTOR CARVERO: “Diez y ocho…” (“Eighteen…” – However, Tommy’s Spanish during his spur-of-the-moment conversation with the Inspector was perhaps a bit “flawed,” as Tommy was certainly at least a few years older than the age he gave.
