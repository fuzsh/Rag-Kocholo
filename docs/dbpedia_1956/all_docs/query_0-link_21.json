        "text": "Walter \"Steve\" Brodie\n\nBrodie was Roanoke’s first major leaguer (1890-1902). Considered one of the finest outfielders of his day, Brodie batted a career .303 for Boston, St. Louis, Baltimore, Pittsburgh, and New York in the National League and Baltimore in the American League. Brodie lived in Roanoke during most of his major league career, and he brought baseball attention to the area through more than his centerfield play. His “Duke of Roanoke” nickname was a tribute to his refined, gentlemanly nature. When he was traded from the Orioles to Pittsburgh, he coaxed the Pirates into holding spring training in Roanoke in 1897. He also coached at Rutgers, Princeton, and the Naval Academy.\n\nF.J. \"Kid\" Carr\n\nAmong the best-known and most-liked men in the Roanoke Valley’s baseball history, Carr’s work in the sport spanned more than 70 years. A Walters, Virginia native, he came to Roanoke in 1926 to pitch in the Norfolk & Western Railroad League, where he was 15-0 in his first season. A player for 25 years across Southwest Virginia, Carr also managed in semipro ball in Salem and Bedford. In 1947, Carr began umpiring and became a professional scout with the Philadelphia Phillies. He changed clubs and worked two decades for Pittsburgh. Carr was a familiar face behind backstops at pro, college, American Legion and high school games throughout the region.\n\nAl Holland\n\nA Roanoke native who was the National League’s Fireman of the Year in 1983, the southpaw had eight wins and 25 saves for NL champion Philadelphia. Holland, known for his fastball, saved 29 games the following season for the Phillies. He also pitched in the majors with Pittsburgh, San Francisco, California and the New York Yankees. In 10 major-league seasons (1977, 79-87), Holland had a 2.98 ERA, 78 saves and 31 wins. He pitched several no- hitters at Lucy Addison High and starred for American Legion Post 3 and North Carolina A&T. He was 4-2 with 13 saves for the Salem Pirates in a 1976 homecoming en route to the majors.\n\nDave Parker\n\nWith the Salem Pirates, Parker was a Class A Carolina League MVP in 1972, missing a Triple Crown by one homer. He batted .310 with 22 HR,101 RBI, 91 runs, 38 stolen bases and 30 doubles. Still active as a player when elected, Parker had spent 19 seasons in the majors, with Pittsburgh, Cincinnati, Oakland, Milwaukee, California, and Toronto, primarily as a right fielder and DH. He was a feared lefthanded hitter nicknamed “The Cobra,” and he played in three World Series, five championship series and six All- Star Games. Parker was the National League MVP in 1978 with Pittsburgh. He won two NL batting titles (1977-78) and three Gold Gloves.\n\nBilly Sample\n\nThe Salem native batted .272 in nine major league seasons as an outfielder with Texas, the New York Yankees, and Atlanta. Sample starred at Andrew Lewis High (where he doubled as a football receiver), for American Legion Post 3 and at James Madison University. In 1976, he was Madison’s first All-America selection, batting .421. His career average of .338 remains a school record. His best big-league season was 1983, when he hit .274 with 12 homers, 57 RBI and 44 stolen bases for the Rangers. After his playing days, Sample became a network telecast analyst and baseball journalist. He also produced a movie. The Salem High baseball field is named for him.\n\nJack Crosswhite\n\nCrosswhite is the all-time leader in victories by an Appalachian League manager. The Salem native and former catcher managed five different Appy clubs over 10 seasons (1946-55), winning pennants at New River, Kingsport, Welch, and Salem. His Appy record was 688-533. Crosswhite also won the 1942 pennant at Pulaski in the Class C Virginia League. He had more than 800 career wins as a skipper. He played for Andrew Lewis High in the late ’20s and began his pro career with Galax in the Virginia League in 1933-34. He played in the Yankees farm system at Bassett and Norfolk (1935-38), and with the Roanoke Red Sox in the Piedmont League from 1943-45. Later a scout, Crosswhite died in 1971.\n\nRon Hodges\n\nHodges played 12 seasons as a catcher with the New York Mets (1973-84), batting .240 primarily as a backup and pinch-hitter. As a rookie, he played in the 1973 World Series. He batted .260 as a part-time starter in 1983 and was 6-for-14 as a pinch hitter. A Rocky Mount native and resident, Hodges was an All-Piedmont District catcher at Franklin County High. At Appalachian State University, he won the Adirondack Big Stick Award as a sophomore, batting .422. As a junior in 1971, Hodges was an NAIA All-America choice and hit .714 in the NAIA national tournament. A member of the Appalachian State Hall of Fame, Hodges reached the majors after less than two seasons in the minors.\n\nJohnny Oates\n\nOates, the Baltimore Orioles’ manager at his induction, came to Virginia Tech from Prince George and batted .372 in two seasons before signing with the Birds. The catcher became the second Tech product to reach the majors. He spent 11 seasons (1970, ’72-81) with the Orioles, Braves, Phillies, Dodgers and Yankees. Oates batted a career .250 and appeared in two World Series with Los Angeles. He managed three seasons in the minors, winning Southern (AA) and International (AAA) league titles (1982 and ’88) at Nashville and Rochester and was the IL runner-up at Columbus (’83). From 1984- 87, he was a coach with the Chicago Cubs and Baltimore’s first base coach from 1989 until 1991, when he was named O's manager.\n\nRuss Peters\n\nA Roanoke area native and Bedford resident, Russ Peters played 10 seasons in the American League with the Philadelphia Athletics (1936-38), Cleveland Indians (1940-44, ’46), and St. Louis Browns (1947). Peters batted .235, primarily as a utility infielder. He was the first AL infielder to wear glasses, and with the Athletics in 1936, Peters became one of the few players in history to homer over the famous Shibe Park roof. In his final season, with the Browns, Peters led the majors in pinch-hitting (6-for-11). He batted a solid .298 as a career pinch-hitter. Peters spent his youth in Dayton, Ohio, returning to Roanoke in 1932 to begin his baseball career in the Railroad League.\n\nRalph Richardson\n\nRecognized as “Mr. Baseball” in the Roanoke Valley for three decades, Richardson is responsible for keeping Salem teams in the Appalachian and Carolina leagues from 1955-79. Richardson, a grocer, teamed with Jack Dame to head the Salem Athletic Club, the guiding force behind local pro baseball. Richardson, the club’s vice president, was known for handling game-day operations of the franchise in a quiet, classy way, often paying baseball bills from his grocery store receipts. A Riner native, Richardson is a 1934 Salem High graduate. Richardson was awarded the Bronze Star and Silver Star for Army service in Europe in World War II. He is a two-time president of the Associated Grocers of America.\n\nPablo Cruz\n\nCruz, the Pittsburgh Pirates’ scouting supervisor in Latin America, was regarded as the Salem Pirates’ most popular player during the club’s first two decades. The Dominican Republic native signed with Pittsburgh in 1965 and began as an infielder with Gastonia in the Western Carolinas League. He first played for Salem in 1968, batting .246 as shortstop. He rose to Class AAA in 1970-71. Cruz returned to Salem in 1974-77 to finish his career as a player-coach. He batted .294 over five Salem seasons, with 38 stolen bases, 9 homers, and 183 RBI. His .326 average for Salem’s 1974 Carolina League-winning team nearly won the batting title. His experience and guidance were crucial to Latin players who came to Salem.\n\nJack Dame\n\nLongtime manager of the Salem Civic Center, Jack Dame was GM of the Salem club in the Appalachian League and president of the Salem Athletic Club. He and Ralph Richardson worked closely as founders of the franchise. Dame devoted his considerable energy to organizing and promoting. He began in baseball management in 1949 with a semipro team from Salem and was the guiding force of the club in the 1950s and ’60s in the Appalachian League, as the franchise moved toward Carolina League membership. Named minor league executive of the year several times, Dame also was general manager of the first Salem Rebels hockey club and served as a city councilman. Dame died in 1982 at age 61.\n\nBoyd \"Hawkbill\" Hall\n\nA major presence in Franklin County baseball since the 1920s, Hall is known and honored for his volunteer work for the sport. After playing semipro ball, Hall helped form county leagues in which he coached for two decades. He founded an umpires association and called games himself. He built fences at several fields, dragged diamonds with his personal vehicles and purchased bats, balls and uniforms for teams. He even sold concessions from the back of his truck.
