        "text": "I was pleased to help a fact-checker at Logically Facts explain \"How fake experts are fueling climate change denial.\"\n\nIn which I was intrigued by a reference to \"Sir Roredick Murchison.\"\n\nI just found on my desk a little promotional teddy bear that accompanied the review copy of Frank Sulloway's Darwin and His Bears, which I reviewed for The American Biology Teacher in 2022. (Drop me a line if you want a PDF.)\n\nGood for Grace Brady, a recent high school graduate who reportedly spearheaded Illinois's climate change education bill, HB 4895, which is currently on Governor Pritzker's desk.\n\nI'm looking forward to reading Keeping the Faith, Brenda Wineapple's new book about the Scopes trial. (Now would be a good time to ask me to write a review, editors!) https://lnkd.in/gQhVyeZs\n\nClimate change education at the middle school level is crucial, so I was pleased to be part of a research team that found substantial improvements in U.S. public school middle school science classrooms between 2014 and 2019.\n\nToday I directed someone to Warren Allem's 1959 master's thesis, for which he interviewed a lot of people living in Dayton, Tennessee, during the Scopes trial, so it seems like a good idea to ask again: who was Warren Allem?\n\nIf you missed my \"Twists and Turns in Teaching Evolution\" talk on July 11, never fear: it's already on the Center for Inquiry's YouTube channel."
