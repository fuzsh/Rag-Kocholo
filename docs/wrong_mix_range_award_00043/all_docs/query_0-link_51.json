The endowment of a Chair is a highly valued means of supporting the University and a particularly wise investment in higher education.\n\nInformation about the endowed chairs is of historical significance, and of general interest, too. Some of it is summarized here.\n\n9.2.1 Clement Chandler Avard and Florence Sybil Avard Chair in French Language\n\nThe endowment for this Chair was provided by a bequest from the estate of Clement Chandler Avard, 1875-1956. Born in Point de Bute, he graduated from the New Brunswick Teachers' College and Mount Allison, B.A., 1898. He was called to the Bar in New Brunswick in 1901 but did not practice. He established the Sackville Tribune in 1902 and the Tribune Printing Company in 1906, and continued in control of these companies until 1947. During his lifetime he served on the Board of Directors of several Maritime Companies.\n\nHe had a deep interest in education. For fifteen years he served as Chairman of the Sackville School Board. He was a member of the Board of Regents of Mount Allison for thirty-four years, and also served as Chairman. In 1948 he was honoured by Mount Allison University with a Doctor of Literature Degree.\n\nThe Chair, established in 1956, has been held by Allan MacBeth, B.A., M.A., 1956-1965; J. Gordon Andison, B.A., M.A., Ph.D., 1965-1970; Peter Edwards, B.A., M.A., Ph.D., 2005-2007, and Mark Lee, B.A., M.A., Ph.D., 2019-2024.\n\n9.2.2 The Walter B. Cowan Chair in Religious Studies\n\nThe Walter B. Cowan Chair in Religious Studies is endowed with a bequest from Walter B. Cowan, a distinguished lawyer and prominent United Church layman. Charles H.H. Scobie, S.T.M., M.A., B.D., Ph.D., D.D., was appointed the first Cowan Professor of Religious Studies in 1985 and Fiona Black B.A., M.A., Ph.D., 2019-2024.\n\n9.2.3 The Edgar and Dorothy Davidson Chair in Canadian Studies\n\nBelieved to be the first of its kind in Canada, the Edgar and Dorothy Davidson Chair of Canadian Studies was established in 1969. The Chair has been most generously endowed and is named in honour of Dr. Edgar Davidson and Dr. Dorothy Davidson of Ottawa.\n\nMr. and Mrs. Davidson have over the years gathered together a rich collection of Canadiana books, imprints and manuscripts of great rarity and value and many fine examples of early Canadian glass, of Canadian furniture of the 18th Century, and of Canadian painting and sculpture of the 19th and 20th Centuries. In making the gift of this superb collection to Mount Allison, the donors stated that:\n\n...we are prompted to make this gift in recognition of the great contribution made by the men and women of the Maritimes toward our national life from its early beginnings to the present time. We furthermore have selected a New Brunswick university because we believe that in this province more is done toward solving the crucial problem of achieving a bi-cultural life than anywhere else in Canada.\n\n... We have been impressed with the splendid facilities and aims of Mount Allison and with what is done there for young people, not merely from an academic point of view but also from a cultural one.\n\nThe following scholars have held the chair since establishment: George F.G. Stanley, O.C., B.A., B.Litt., M.A., D.Phil., D-es-L., D.Litt., LL.D., D.C.L., F.R. Hist.S., F.R.S.C., 1969-1975; Douglas Grant Lochhead, B.A., M.A., B.L.S., D.Litt, LL.D., F.R.S.C., 1975-1987; Lawrence D.

Manning Chair in Commerce\n\nThis Chair is named in honour of the late Fred C. Manning, an outstanding Nova Scotian industrialist and distinguished Allisonian whose generous bequest to the University made possible its establishment.\n\nDr. Manning was born in Falmouth, Nova Scotia and attended Mount Allison Academy 1909-1910. When presented for the honorary degree at the May Convocation at Mount Allison in 1955 it was stated:\n\n... he is President and controlling owner of multimillion dollar businesses in the Maritimes, the Canadian West, and in far off Venezuela. Director of a score or more companies, Fred Manning's record stands as an inspiration and challenge to every ambitious young student in the Commerce Course, and effectively refutes the statement that there are no opportunities in the Maritimes.\n\nDr. Manning contributed to Mount Allison the cost of the Physics and Engineering Building, which is dedicated “to the advancement of Scientific knowledge.” Mrs. Manning contributed funds for decorating and furnishing the Manning Room in the Chapel, as “an expression of her deep interest and concern for the religious life of the University Community.”\n\nProfessor Dan C. Patridge, B.Sc., M.B.A., was the Fred C. Manning Professor of Commerce from 1971 to 1996.\n\n9.2.5 The Hart Almerrin Massey Chair in Philosophy\n\nThe following scholars have held the chair since establishment: Roy Balmer Liddy, B.D., Ph.D., 1915-1931; Charles Arthur Krug, M.A., B.D., 1931-1947; Clayton Amos Baxter, M.A., Ph.D., 1947-1965; and Cyril Francis Poole, B.A., M.A., Ph.D., 1965-1977; Paul Bogaard, B.A., M.A., Ph.D., 2006-2010; Roopen Majithia B.A., M.A., Ph.D., 2019-2024.\n\n9.2.6 The Pickard-Bell Chair in Music\n\nThis Chair was established in 1966 with a generous endowment from the estate of Winthrop Pickard Bell, B.A., M.A., Ph.D. This very substantial bequest to Mount Allison was in memory of Dr. Bell's mother, Mary Emerancy Pickard Bell, the first teacher of piano in the Conservatory of Music, 1873-1882. (In 1965 Dr. Ralph P. Bell, brother of Dr. Winthrop Bell, donated the Mount Allison Chapel Organ, also in memory of his mother). Mary Emerancy Pickard Bell graduated from the Mount Allison Ladies' College in 1866 with a degree of Mistress of Liberal Arts. From 1866-1869 she taught Literature, Mathematics and Calisthenics at the Ladies College, and in 1873 she joined the Faculty of the Conservatory of Music.\n\nWinthrop P. Bell was one of Mount Allison's most illustrious and loyal graduates. An outstanding scholar, he graduated with honours in Mathematics, Bachelor of Arts and Master of Arts degree. He also earned an M.A. from Harvard and a Ph.D. from Gottigen, Germany. He lectured at the University of Toronto and at Harvard University, eventually returning to Nova Scotia to engage in business and pursue scholarly activities.\n\nA loyal Allisonian and churchman, he annually supported the financial program of the university and encouraged classmates and friends to rally around their \"alma mater.\" It is for one of his earliest works, composed when a student at Mount Allison, that he is best remembered by all Allisonians, for he wrote the lyrics of the \"Alma Mater\" song. Since 1906 this song has been sung by students at the University and by Allisonians throughout the world. Dr. Bell served on the Board of Regents from 1948-1951. He died in 1965.\n\nIn 1965 Mount Allison received Dr. Winthrop Bell's entire library, more than half of which is a very valuable collection of Acadiana.\n\nThe following scholars have held the chair since establishment: George A.
