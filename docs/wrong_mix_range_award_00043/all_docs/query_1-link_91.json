        "text": "Chapter 27 of my book Endurance Training – Science and Practice is dedicated to “Unhealthy air and water environments: effects on endurance training and competition”. The chapter was written by my friend and colleague Randy Wilber, Senior Sport Physiologist at the U.S. Olympic Training Center in Colorado Springs, where the air quality is usually really good.\n\nRandy’s chapter provides the most recent information on the challenges that the endurance athlete faces when training and competing in an air-polluted environment, but the importance of breathing clean air for health has been known for a very long time. Here are several extracts from Hitchcock & Hitchcock’ 1860 book Elementary Anatomy and Physiology for Colleges, Academies and Other Schools.\n\n(more…)\n\nThe great British physiologist Sir Andrew Huxley died a few days ago at the age of 94. One of his major achievements was explaining how electricity travels the length of a single nerve cell, for which he was awarded the 1963 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine. The prize was shared with fellow scientists Sir John Eccles and Alan L. Hodgkin, whose joint work revealed the key triggers that spark the nervous system’s electrical system into life.\n\nThat muscle contraction and movement required electricity had been known for two centuries, but how this electricity was generated and transmitted in living organisms was a complete mistery, as we can see in the following extracts from Hitchcock & Hitchcock’ 1860 book Elementary Anatomy and Physiology for Colleges, Academies and Other Schools.\n\n(more…)\n\nIn my lectures and presentations to coaches and students, I often emphasize that I do not consider training as a single isolated event, but as a cycle including the time spent training and the subsequent phase of recovery. For many years, a lot of emphasis has been placed on how to train better, harder, longer, while recovery was somewhat neglected. In the past few years, however, there has been a growing interest on recovery, with major training and sports research centers around the world building recovery facilities and studying how to improve athletes’ recovery.\n\nThese ideas on the training-recovery cycle are certainly not new. Here are some quotes from Hitchcock & Hitchcock’ 1860 book Elementary Anatomy and Physiology for Colleges, Academies and Other Schools.\n\n(more…)\n\nChristmas time is here, and for those of us living in the wealthier parts of the world, these days are characterised by a lot of eating, most often way too much eating. Here is what can be read about that in Hitchcock & Hitchcock’ 1860 book Elementary Anatomy and Physiology for Colleges, Academies and Other Schools.\n\n“334. Danger of eating too much.-2. We see that there is a great danger of eating too much. Large quantities of food distend the coats of the stomach, and give too much labor for them to perform. As a natural consequence the gastric glands are weakened from excessive action, and then indigestión or some other diseased action is sure to follow. And in how much better health would multitudes in the higher clases of society be kept, if some of the numerous dishes they use were omitted! And in this country the remark applies to nearly all classes.”\n\n(more…)\n\nA few years ago my dear friend Heather from Hemet, California was working at an antique bookshop. When the shop closed down, the owner told her she could grab some books in compensation for the salary he owed her. Heather found an 1860 textbook on anatomy and physiology and sent it to me as a gift, thinking that I could be interested in comparing what was known back then with today’s knowledge. What a wonderful present you sent me, Heather!\n\nRecently, I grabbed the book again and found some extremely interesting material that I would like to share with you. There is plenty of good material in the book, and I intend to reproduce it in several posts. Some of the contents I agree with, some I don’t, but the latter are interesting nonetheless.\n\n(more…)\n\nRobert M. Sapolsky is Professor of Biology and Neuroscience at Stanford University. For over a decade, he has been spending his summers in the Masai Mara National Reserve in the Serengeti Plain of Kenia, studying the relationships between social behavior and dominance rank in wild baboons, the amount of social stress they experience, and how their bodies react to stress.\n\nAccording to Robert Sapolsky, “an average baboon in the Serengeti spends 30 to 40 percent of each day foraging – climbing trees to reach fruit and leaves, digging laboriously in the ground to unearth tubers, walking five or ten miles to reach sources of food. Their diet is spartan: figs and olives, grass and sedge parts, corms, tubers and seedpods. It’s unusual for them to hunt or scavenge, and meat accounts for less than 1 percent of the food they consume. So the typical baboon diet teems with fiber and is very low in fat, sugar, and cholesterol.”\n\n(more…)\n\nI just found out that the great Forbes Carlile, a legendary swimming coach from Australia published a review on my book Tapering and Peaking for Optimal Performance last year. The book review can be found on page 5 of this document: http://www.swimmingcoach.org/wsca/pdf/WSCAnl2010-02.pdf\n\nHere are some selected sentences from Carlile’s review:\n\n\"With this comprehensive scientific and practical exposition of the taper in some 208 pages, Dr. Mujika has produced the first book on the subject.\"\n\n\"Mujika, the scientist, goes much further than reporting concepts. He is interested in seeking reliable knowledge established in peer-reviewed articles. It is in this that much of the value of Mujika’s work lies.\"\n\n\"He then translates the findings of his research into practical advice embracing a number of sports.\"\n\n\"Athletes and coaches will find much in Mujika’s clearly-expressed advice to set them thinking.\"\n\n\"With its focus on experimental evidence, Mujika’s work is a very valuable contribution to knowledge concerning the optimisation of human performance. It could result in many revising their ideas about the taper.\"\n\nFor those of you who may not know who Forbes Carlile is, I recommend this link: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forbes_Carlile. He turned 90 a month ago (happy Birthday Mr. Carlile!), but he is still going strong and keeps spreading his passion for swimming: http://northern-district-times.whereilive.com.au/news/story/forbes-carlile-turns-90\n\nTo finish off, I will mention that I always quote Forbes Carlile when I lecture on the contribution of sport science to high performance sport: “The training of athletes for strenuous physical activity today is much an art and less of a science”.\n\nPedro Miguel Etxenike is a Basque scientist, Professor of Condensed Matter Physics whose views on science, research and many other areas of life are always extremely interesting. He was recently interviewed by Diario de Noticias de Navarra, a newspaper published in my hometown Pamplona, and I thought the material was so good that I should share it with the readers of my blog.\n\nThe article was published in Spanish (click here to read it), but I have translated some of his statements from that interview, which you can read below:"
