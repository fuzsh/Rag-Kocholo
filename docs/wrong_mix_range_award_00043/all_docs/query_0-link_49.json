        "text": "Red Heaven (Winner)\n\nNicolas Rothwell\n\nShortlist year: 2022\n\nShortlist category: Fiction\n\nPublished by: Text Publishing\n\n‘Red Heaven’ is the story of a child’s journey to adulthood, his loss of those he loves and his fixing of them in memory. It begins in the late 1960s in Switzerland, as the boy’s ideas about life are being shaped by two rival influences.\n\n‘Red Heaven’ is about the people who make us what we are: how they come into our lives, affect us, then depart the stage. This fiction, alive to the elusive beauties and sadnesses of the world, is Nicolas Rothwell’s finest achievement.\n\nNicolas Rothwell\n\nNicolas Rothwell lives in Far North Queensland and is a former foreign correspondent. His award-winning books include ‘The Red Highway’, ‘Belomor’ and, most recently, ‘Quicksilver’. ‘Belemor’ and ‘Quicksilver’ were both awarded by the Prime Minister’s Literary Awards.\n\nJudges’ comments\n\nNicolas Rothwell’s ‘Red Heaven’ is a dazzling novel for the ages. Set mainly in the 1960s upheaval in Eastern Europe, it is as relevant today as it would have been then. It is an echoing reminder that history is the past, present and future. It is a romantic, dramatic, intelligent, cultured, political, cinematic, and, above all, human story that centres on the people who love us and who we love in return, regardless of the cost. It shows, via the main character, a parentless boy who becomes a solitary man, how deeply we are formed by the people closest to us.\n\nDevotion\n\nHannah Kent\n\nShortlist year: 2022\n\nShortlist category: Fiction\n\nPublished by: Pan Macmillan Australia: Picador\n\nPrussia, 1836\n\nHanne Nussbaum is a child of nature – she would rather run wild in the forest than conform to the limitations of womanhood. In her village of Kay, Hanne is friendless and considered an oddity . . . until she meets Thea.\n\nOcean, 1838\n\nThe Nussbaums are Old Lutherans, bound by God’s law and at odds with their King’s order for reform. Forced to flee religious persecution the families of Kay board a crowded, disease-riddled ship bound for the new colony of South Australia. In the face of brutal hardship, the beauty of whale song enters Hanne’s heart, along with the miracle of her love for Thea. Theirs is a bond that nothing can break.\n\nThe whale passed. The music faded.\n\nSouth Australia, 1838\n\nA new start in an old land. God, society and nature itself decree Hanne and Thea cannot be together. But within the impossible . . . is devotion.\n\nHannah Kent\n\nHannah Kent’s first novel, the international bestseller, ‘Burial Rites’ (2013), was translated into over 30 languages and won the Australian Book Industry Awards – Literary Fiction Book of the Year, the Indie Awards Debut Fiction Book of the Year, the Australian Booksellers Association – Nielsen Bookdata Bookseller’s Choice Award, the Victorian Premier’s People’s Choice Award and the Fellowship of Australian Writers Christina Stead Award. It is currently being adapted for film by Sony TriStar. Hannah’s second novel, ‘The Good People’ (2016), was also translated into many languages and is currently being adapted for film by Aquarius Productions.\n\nJudges’ comments\n\nHannah Kent’s ‘Devotion’ traces life in three parts through the eyes of Hanne. Religious bigotry at home (Prussia 1836) sees Old Lutherans – the Nussbaums, take to the seas (Ocean 1838) escaping persecution. South Australia 1838 was sold to them as a new start. Kent’s characters are always in place, the families, the land – its soil and trees, the animals – domesticated then wild, vividly evoked. Devotion is rooted in place and ethereal in rendition, it is the language of sound, light, and love that stays long after reading. Devotion between Hanne and Thea survives death and through Hanne’s spirit form we have panoptic vision of the colony encountering the original people – the Peramangk, without whom many of the newcomers would have died. There is magic here too. ‘Devotion’ demands attention and surrendering to it brings immense reward.\n\nNight Blue\n\nAngela O’Keeffe\n\nShortlist year: 2022\n\nShortlist category: Fiction\n\nPublished by: Transit Lounge\n\nPotent, haunting and lyrical, Night Blue is a debut novel like no other, a narrative largely told in the voice of the painting Blue Poles. It is a truly original and absorbing approach to revisiting Jackson Pollock and his wife Lee Krasner as artists and people, as well as a realigning our ideas around the cultural legacy of Whitlam’s purchase of Blue Poles in 1973.\n\nIt is also the story of Alyssa, and a contemporary relationship, in which Angela O’Keeffe immerses us in the essential power of art to change our personal lives and, by turns, a nation.\n\nMoving between New York and Australia with fluid ease, Night Blue is intimate and tender, yet surprisingly dramatic. It is a glorious exploration of how art must never be undervalued.\n\nAngela O’Keeffe\n\nAngela O’Keeffe grew up on a farm in South East Queensland and now lives in Sydney. She completed a Master of Arts in Writing at University of Technology Sydney and has had short stories published in literary journals. Night Blue is her first book.\n\nJudges’ comments\n\nAngela O’Keeffe had a bold idea, to tell the story of Jackson Pollock’s Blue Poles from the perspective not of those who purchased or indeed gaze upon it, but that of the painting itself. It was unquestionably risky, and in our view, she has succeeded brilliantly.\n\nO’Keeffe brings the artwork, Blue Poles, to glorious life in ‘Night Blue’ inviting the reader to journey with the masterpiece from its first home on the floor of an old barn in Long Island, New York, across the seas to Australia. It is a triumph of her own imagination, and an invitation to our own.\n\nPurchased for a record price in 1973, Blue Poles generated much controversy and debate about art and cultural life in Australia, at a time of political and creative tumult. Today, the painting is considered both beautiful and tremendously satisfying; something to devour. So, too, this slim novel, in which O’Keeffe takes on important themes including the disturbing behaviour of famous artists across history; the Dismissal of the Whitlam government by the Governor General; and the purpose and the value of art. Blue Poles learns, as it journeys, much about itself; we learn, in this novel, as much about the country we once were, and still hope to be.\n\nThe Hands of Pianists\n\nStephen Downes\n\nShortlist year: 2022\n\nShortlist category: Fiction\n\nPublished by: Fomite\n\nA neurotic freelance writer aims to prove that pianos kill elite pianists. For decades, he has grappled with the guilt that followed an accident in which he severed his talented sister’s fingers, ending her promising career at the keyboard. His investigations centre on the violent deaths at 31 of three great pianists, his detective work taking him from Melbourne to Geelong and Sydney, to the south of France, London, Sussex, and the Czech Republic.\n\nStephen Downes\n\nStephen Downes’s short story ‘Last Meal’ won the 2020 United Kingdom Fiction Factory’s prize, and five of his recent stories have been longlisted and shortlisted in prestigious UK competitions, including the Bridport and Fish prizes. A few of his food-themed non-fiction books have won Australian and international awards. A lifelong writer and journalist, he reviewed restaurants weekly over many years for some of Australia’s top newspapers, including The Australian Financial Review. Salaried at The Age, he was a section editor and leader and feature writer. He covered a Middle-East war for Agence France-Presse and a Pacific uprising for The Age.\n\nJudges’ comments\n\nStephen Downes’ ‘The Hands of Pianists’ is an extraordinary piece of fiction which rehearses the shadows and startling insights of a quest to fathom the disturbing hypothesis of the talented pianist as the victim of a predestined doom. The book has a brilliant sense of darkness and an irresistible dramatic power. It is manifestly influenced by the great German re-animator of the actual W.G. Sebald but Downes’ use of Sebald’s fictional idiom and strategies is something he makes his own with a virtuoso assurance that actually brings to mind the great seventeenth century dramatists who were the peers of Shakespeare because they wore his influence like a glove from which they could achieve mighty things. ‘The Hands of Pianists’ is a patently mad book by a writer of the very first rank who can conjure multitudes of felt realities even as his narrator probes the darkest and most deranged reaches of self-scrutiny. This is a debut novel by a man of 74 who has spent a lifetime writing with great élan and authority about food. It may be far from everyday taste but it reminds us of why Thomas Bernhard and WG Sebald are among the greater writers since World War II because of the ways in which it equals them.\n\nDark as Last Night\n\nTony Birch\n\nShortlist year: 2022\n\nShortlist category: Fiction\n\nPublished by: University of Queensland Press\n\nDark as Last Night’ confirms, once again, that Tony Birch is a master of the short story. These exceptional stories capture the importance of human connection at pivotal moments in our lives, whether those occur because of the loss of a loved one or the uncertainties of childhood.\n\nIn this collection we witness a young girl struggling to protect her mother from her father’s violence, two teenagers clumsily getting to know one another by way of a shared love of music, and a man mourning the death of his younger brother, while beset by memories and regrets from their shared past.\n\nThroughout this powerful collection, Birch’s concern for the humanity of those who are often marginalised or overlooked shines bright.\n\nTony Birch\n\nTony Birch is an Indigenous author of three novels: the bestselling ‘The White Girl’, winner of the 2020 NSW Premier’s Award for Indigenous Writing, and shortlisted for the 2020 Miles Franklin Literary Prize; ‘Ghost River’, winner of the 2016 Victorian Premier’s Literary Award for Indigenous Writing; and ‘Blood’, which was shortlisted for the Miles Franklin Award in 2012. He is also the author of ‘Shadowboxing’ and four short story collections. In 2017 he was awarded the Patrick White Literary Award. Tony Birch is also an activist, historian and essayist.\n\nJudges’ comments\n\n‘Dark as Last Night’, a volume of short stories by an Aboriginal writer about marginal lives and working class people is likely to become an Australian classic. Tony Birch has been described as “more like Chekhov, than Carver”. He is sometimes brutal, sometimes tender, and always empathetic. Half in love with most of his characters, he is sharply insightful about those he doesn’t love: the husband and father who beats his wife and daughter; or the neighbourhood kids who steal a child’s much loved “shining red dragster bike”, and smash it up after they are confronted. Birch has a wonderful ability to bring his stories to life with a bizarre but telling detail. A short, pencil thin woman, known as “Little Red” befriends the young female narrator of the title story “Dark as Last Night”. Little Red recommends smoking to her young friend – “Cigarettes calm you down”. She lives in a house, where a previous inhabitant papered the walls with old newspapers, stretching back decades. The landlord had offered to paint over them. She said no. She tells the narrator why: “I now have all these stories from around the world. They give me company.” These stories will give us company for a long time. Birch is a master story teller.\n\nRogue Forces: An explosive insiders’ account of Australian SAS war crimes in Afghanistan (Winner)\n\nMark Willacy\n\nShortlist year: 2022\n\nShortlist category: Non-fiction\n\nPublished by: Simon & Schuster Australia\n\nMark Willacy, who won a Gold Walkley for exposing SAS war crimes, has penetrated the SAS code of silence to reveal one of the darkest chapters in our country’s military history.\n\nWillacy’s devastating award-winning Four Corners program, ‘Killing Fields’ captured on film for the first time a war crime perpetrated by an Australian: the killing of a terrified, unarmed Afghan man in a field by an SAS soldier. It caused shockwaves around the world and resulted in an Australian Federal Police war crimes investigation. It also sparked a new line of investigation by the Brereton inquiry, the independent Australian Defence Force inquiry into war crimes in Afghanistan. It was a game changer.\n\nBut for Willacy, it was just the beginning of a much bigger story. More SAS soldiers came forward with undeniable evidence and eyewitness testimony of other unlawful killings, and exposed a culture of brutality and impunity.\n\n‘Rogue Forces’ takes you out on the patrols where the killings happened. The result is a gripping character-driven story that embeds you on the front line in the thick of the action as those soldiers share for the first time what they witnessed. Willacy also confronts those accused about their sides of the story.\n\nAt its heart, ‘Rogue Forces’ is a story about the true heroes who had the courage to come forward and expose the truth.\n\nThis is their story. A story that had to be told.\n\nMark Willacy\n\nMark Willacy has been a journalist for more than 25 years and reported for the ABC from more than 30 countries. Mark is a seven-time Walkley Award winner and in 2020 he was awarded Australia’s highest honour in journalism, the Gold Walkley, for exposing alleged Australian SAS war crimes in Afghanistan. His winning Four Corners report ‘Killing Field’ made headlines around the world and sparked a federal police war crimes investigation. Mark has twice been named Queensland Journalist of the Year and in 2019 he won a Logie Award for his Four Corners’ world exclusive on the Thai cave rescue.\n\nJudges’ comments\n\nIn often-disturbing detail Mark Willacy chronicles a series of unlawful killings by elements within Australia’s elite Special Air Services Regiment during its long deployment to Afghanistan. Challenging deeply-held, laudatory views of Australia’s military tradition, Willacy explains that the crimes committed cannot be excused as a consequence of the fog of war. Rather, there was a serious, sometimes-fatal breakdown of military discipline that saw non-commissioned officers exercise unrestrained authority – and which complicated and even compromised the task of winning the hearts and minds of the very people the SAS was ostensibly defending.\n\nIn part, this breakdown of the chain of command reflected the nature of the SAS’s mission in Afghanistan, where small groups of special forces soldiers were deployed in remote areas, far from centres of command. As Willacy demonstrates, however, the crimes committed in Afghanistan had deeper origins, that were evident in the adulation heaped upon the SAS and which encouraged a corrupted warrior culture that was sharply at odds with the moral order the Regiment was ostensibly representing. Yet, crucially, Willacy’s account is only possible due to the courage of those members of the military who remained true to their principles and who spoke out against the wrongs that had been committed. Ostracized and sometimes fearful for their own safety, these whistle-blowers emerge as real heroes from Australia’s painful intervention in Afghanistan. This is a confronting, but important book.\n\nAnother Day in the Colony\n\nChelsea Watego\n\nShortlist year: 2022\n\nShortlist category: Non-fiction\n\nPublished by: University of Queensland Press\n\nIn this collection of deeply insightful and powerful essays, Chelsea Watego examines the ongoing and daily racism faced by First Nations peoples in so-called Australia. Rather than offer yet another account of ‘the Aboriginal problem’, she theorises a strategy for living in a society that has only ever imagined Indigenous peoples as destined to die out.\n\nDrawing on her own experiences and observations of the operations of the colony, she exposes the lies that settlers tell about Indigenous people. In refusing such stories, Chelsea narrates her own: fierce, personal, sometimes funny, sometimes anguished. She speaks not of fighting back but of standing her ground against colonialism in academia, in court and in the media. It’s a stance that takes its toll on relationships, career prospects and even the body.\n\nYet when told to have hope, Watego’s response rings clear: Fuck hope. Be sovereign.\n\nChelsea Watego\n\nChelsea Watego is a Munanjahli and South Sea Islander woman born and raised on Yuggera country. First trained as an Aboriginal health worker, she is an Indigenist health humanities scholar, prolific writer and public intellectual. When not referred to as ‘Vern and Elaine’s baby’, she is also Kihi, Maya, Eliakim, Vernon and George’s mum.\n\nJudges’ comments\n\n“Once we were massacred, now we are researched.” These six essays, written to Blackfullas from the embodied knowledge of an urban Indigenous woman, address the everyday and disavow double consciousness. The author discards being “a problem” for being “sovereign” and “funny”. She rejects the politics of politeness and writes in the tradition of Du Bois and Deloria. No one, White or Black gets a free pass except the Indigenous community of Inala, a Brisbane suburb. Police ask a white woman if her parents know she is with “him”, her Indigenous husband; they arrest a female member of a police liaison committee, and arrest and assault a female professor. Without permission, schools dress urban Aboriginal children in lap laps to entice female teachers to remote Queensland. The health sciences “bury the bodies of a dying race”. The humanities pillage graves. There is a speaking circuit of cannibalistic white writers, expert on Aborigines. “DNA Aborigines” perform indigeneity and are the new Native Police measuring themselves by proximity to whiteness. Professor Watego contests “consumable Aboriginal culture.” Hope, she says, is for Whitefellas; Blackfullas must turn up, tell the truth, and live in an Indigenous sovereign present – with joy.\n\n‘Title Fight: How the Yindjibarndi battled and defeated a mining giant’\n\nPaul Cleary\n\nShortlist year: 2022\n\nShortlist category: Non-fiction\n\nPublished by: Schwartz Books: Black Inc.\n\n‘Title Fight’ reveals the real impact of industrial scale iron ore mining on Indigenous Australians and their ancient heritage. It tells how Fortescue Metals, one of Australia’s biggest businesses, has used Wild West tactics to mine more than $20 billion of iron ore despite having no agreement in place with the native title holders. It tells how small group of Yindjibarndi people, whose leader Michael Woodley left school in sixth grade, waged a tenacious 13-year battle to defend their Country and went all the way to the High Court to do so.\n\nAt a moment of national reckoning with our colonial and ancient past, with our relationship to the land, ‘Title Fight’ asks some critical questions: Who does the land belong to? Who gets to choose what it’s used for? And whose side are we on?\n\nPaul Cleary\n\nPaul Cleary began his career with the Fairfax press, leading to a decade of economic policy reporting in the Canberra press gallery. After studying in the UK as a Chevening Scholar, he became an adviser to Timor-Leste on resource negotiations. His work has focused on resource conflicts and policy, and his books include ‘Trillion Dollar Baby’, ‘Mine-Field’, ‘Shakedown’ and ‘Too Much Luck’, which The New Yorker described as a ‘fierce, concise book’ that investigated how the resources boom was being ‘classically mismanaged’. In recent years he has worked with and written about the First Peoples of Australia.\n\nJudges’ comments\n\nIn the past 20 years Andrew “Twiggy” Forrest has been associated with Aboriginal reconciliation, jobs for young Aboriginal workers, welfare reform and the cashless welfare card and now Green Hydrogen. Forrest, his Fortescue Metals Group and charitable Minderoo Foundation have waged a relentless public relations campaign through the Australian media. Now journalist Paul Cleary tells the other side of the story of the Fortescue miracle. In ‘Title Fight, How the Yindjibarndi Battled and Defeated a Mining Giant’, Cleary details the tough-minded tactics used by Australia’s richest man to exploit the iron ore resources of Western Australia’s Pilbara region by strong-arming Native Title holders and claimants. Fortescue Metals Group’s Pilbara operations pay royalties about a tenth of those of its Pilbara rivals, Rio Tinto and BHP. But things have not all gone Fortescue’s way. It ran into a 30-year-old, grade six educated traditional owner of the Yindjibarndi people, Michael Woodley. Financially and legally outgunned, Woodley led his people to victory over Fortescue Metals Group in a gruelling 13-year battle that culminated in a High Court ruling in 2020 supporting the 2017 Federal Court judgement by Justice Steven Rares finding in favour of the Yindjibarndi. Lawyers are now negotiating a settlement expected to run to hundreds of millions of dollars. Long before the national outcry over Rio Tinto’s destruction in 2020 of the Juukan Gorge, Woodley was fighting to defend his people’s spiritual connection to the Pilbara. And he won.\n\n‘The Case that Stopped a Nation: The Archibald Prize controversy of 1944’\n\nPeter Edwell\n\nShortlist year: 2022\n\nShortlist category: Non-fiction\n\nPublished by: Halstead Press\n\nA thorough telling of the 1944 Archibald prize scandal involving William Dobell’s winning portrait of fellow artist Joshua Smith, and the court case that ensued. Features a who’s who of the Australian arts scene in the first half of the 20th century.\n\nPeter Edwell\n\nPeter Edwell lectures in history and archaeology at Macquarie University. His previous book was ‘Rome and Persia at War’. Honing his skills as an ancient historian was ideal training for writing ‘The Case that Stopped a Nation’. He lives in Wollongong with his young family.\n\nJudges’ comments\n\nWhen the Archibald Prize was awarded to William Dobell for his portrait of Joshua Smith in 1944, it sparked huge controversy. Was it art or caricature? The modernist painting not only shocked Australians but made international news. Australians, many who had never visited the Art Gallery of NSW, lined up in huge numbers to see the painting for themselves. In this compelling book, Peter Edwell takes readers into the art world, the corridors of power, examines media coverage and the subsequent dramatic court case that captivated a nation. The book examines the controversy from multiple angles: the artist and his subject, the trustees of the Art Gallery and the wider artistic community, and the court case that put Dobell and his art on trial initiated by artists Mary Edwell-Burke and Joseph Wolinski, assisted by counsel Garfield Barwick. Edwell reveals unknown aspects of this story, including a previously unpublished oil on paper study of Smith by Dobell. It is the only complete study of the dispute that echoes to this day. Accordingly, this book about the portrait that shocked and stunned a nation and the impact it had on Dobell, makes a substantial contribution to Australian art history.\n\n‘Puff Piece’\n\nJohn Safran\n\nShortlist year: 2022\n\nShortlist category: Non-fiction\n\nPublished by: Penguin Random House Australia: Hamish Hamilton\n\nThe folks that bring you Marlboro – Philip Morris – are wheezing, slowly dying. Cigarettes are out of favour with everyone, from world governments and investors to, increasingly, smokers. So, what’s their plan?\n\nPrepare to be dazzled. Or, at the very least, befuddled.\n\nPhilip Morris has announced they will shut down as a cigarette company, and relaunch as a health enterprise, dedicated to convincing the one billion smokers of the world to quit.\n\nThe ever-curious John Safran leaves his apartment to find out what on God’s green earth is going on. As he starts digging away he discovers a company up to brand new shenanigans, wangling their way into unexpected places, desperately trying to keep their tobacco business alive by brandishing a mysterious new doohickey called an IQOS.\n\nAnd not only that, now they’re upending language itself, changing the meaning of words. Will they slip past bans by convincing governments they don’t sell ‘cigarettes’ but rather ‘HeatSticks’, and that these don’t emit ‘smoke’ but ‘aerosol’? Can John get the real story out of them without his life catching fire?\n\nWild, hilarious and thought-provoking, ‘Puff Piece’ is a probing look into Big Tobacco and the vaping industry, and how words can be literally a matter of life and death.\n\nJohn Safran\n\nJohn Safran is a writer and filmmaker who always gets in too deep for his own good. His debut book, ‘Murder in Mississippi’, won the Ned Kelly Award for best true crime. His follow up, ‘Depends What You Mean by Extremist’, found him lost among radicals and was shortlisted for the Australian Book Industry Awards. His wild and hilarious documentaries, such as ‘John Safran vs God’ and ‘Jedis & Juggalos’, have received accolades from the Australian Film Institute and Rose d’Or Festival. His latest book is Puff Piece: How Philip Morris set vaping alight (and burned down the English language)’.\n\nJudges’ comments\n\nIn ‘Puff Piece’, John Safran skewers the “sneaky” strategy of Fortune 500 company Philip Morris to keep smokers addicted to its cancer-causing cigarettes in a future consumer and investment environment more logically highly toxic for the prospects of Big Tobacco. In this slippery David and Goliath epic nothing is as it first seems. Under Philip Morris’s ‘unsmoke the world’ scenario, smokers switch to its new IQOS HeatStick, a tobacco heating device it claims produces aerosol rather than smoke, Nicotine Free Dry Particulate Matter rather than tar and fewer chemical hazards than traditional cigarettes. In compelling, fluent, and always entertaining prose, Safran demonstrates that this is nothing more than amoral Big Tobacco puffery designed to evade tightening regulation of smoking. The HeatStick is indeed a smoke and tar producing cigarette, he shows, one just as addictive as Marlboros. With something like 8 million people a year dying from smoking, according to his tally, Safran is justified in demanding to know why the tobacco giant’s deadly manipulation of language and science to secure its future profit share is being allowed to pass (virtually) unremarked. Is it because our attention has shifted from corporate misbehaviour to hotter issues such as Black Lives Matter, MeToo, and climate change? “Philip Morris is committing double homicide,” Safran concludes. “They’re killing us with cigarettes, but they’re also lulling us into apathy – we’re bored to death by the matter.” If we “zone out” as a result, “that’s not on Philip Morris, that’s on us”.\n\n‘The Gaps’ (Winner)\n\nLeanne Hall\n\nShortlist year: 2022\n\nShortlist category: Young adult literature\n\nPublished by: Text Publishing\n\nWhen sixteen-year-old Yin Mitchell is abducted, the news reverberates through the whole Year Ten class at Balmoral Ladies College. As the hours tick by, the girls know the chance of Yin being found alive is becoming smaller and smaller.\n\nEveryone is affected by Yin’s disappearance – even scholarship student Chloe, who usually stays out of Balmoral dramas, is drawn into the maelstrom. And when she begins to form an uneasy alliance with Natalia, the queen of Year Ten, things get even more complicated.\n\nA tribute to friendship in all its guises, ‘The Gaps’ is a moving examination of vulnerability and strength, safety and danger, and the particular uncertainties young women face in the world.\n\nLeanne Hall\n\nLeanne Hall is an author of young adult and children’s fiction. Her debut novel, ‘This Is Shyness’, won the Text Prize for Children’s and Young Adult Writing, and was followed by a sequel, ‘Queen of the Night’. Her novel for younger readers, ‘Iris and the Tiger’, won the Patricia Wrightson Prize for Children’s Literature at the 2017 NSW Premier’s Literary Awards. Leanne works as a children’s and YA specialist at an independent bookshop.\n\nJudges’ comments\n\nThis complex and absorbing dual narrative psychological thriller begins with the news that Yin Mitchell, a Year 10 student from the exclusive private girls’ school Balmoral, has been abducted. Rumours swirl, as suspicion and fear spread amongst the girls and their families\n\nScholarship student Chloe has been at Balmoral for six months, and still feels like an outsider, caught between her old life at the local high school, and the privileged, high achieving culture of Balmoral. Natalia is the queen of Year 10, haughty, commanding, fierce and outspoken. As time goes on, and hope that Yin will be found safe starts to dwindle, Chloe and Natalia are drawn together through Chloe’s art project, with Natalie agreeing to be photographed. This act of self-expression is motivated by Chloe’s desire to critique how society fetishises teenage girls, and has unexpected consequences not only for Chloe and Natalia, but for the whole school community. As Natalia’s invincible façade starts to unravel, Chloe learns of Natalia’s long connection to Yin, and both girls have to face the reality of Yin’s fate.\n\nChloe and Natalia’s evolving friendship is portrayed with aching authenticity, as is the depiction of their families and the school environment. Each, in distinct and perfectly drawn voices, confronts their own vulnerability, rage, fear, guilt, grief, somehow finding resilience in the face of a world that seems to want “their teenage girls ruined”. Readers will find this book confronting yet compelling, and parents of teen girls would do well to process the truths contained and prosecuted therein.\n\n‘Still Alive: Notes from Australia’s immigration detention system’\n\nSafdar Ahmed\n\nShortlist year: 2022\n\nShortlist category: Young adult literature\n\nPublished by: Twelve Panels Press\n\nIn early 2011, Safdar Ahmed visited Sydney’s Villawood Immigration Detention Centre for the first time. He brought pencils and sketchbooks into the centre and started drawing with the people detained there. Their stories are told in this book.\n\nInterweaving journalism, history and autobiography, ‘Still Alive’ is an intensely personal indictment of Australia’s refugee detention policies and procedures. It is also a searching reflection on the redemptive power of art. And death metal.\n\nSafdar Ahmed\n\nSafdar Ahmed is a Sydney-based artist, musician and educator. He is a founding member of the community art organisation Refugee Art Project, and member of eleven, a collective of contemporary Muslim Australian artists, curators and writers. He is the author of ‘Reform and Modernity in Islam’ (2013) and the Walkley Award–winning documentary web-comic ‘Villawood: Notes from an immigration detention centre’ (2015). He also sings and plays guitar with the anti-racist death metal band Hazeen.\n\nJudges’ comments\n\nThis confronting work of graphic non-fiction stands as a powerful statement about the impact of Australia’s refugee politics in recent decades. Both the writing and the art are unadorned – the images and text work together to illuminate the lived reality of life under Australia’s refugee system. It is uncompromising in its account of the forces and agendas which have seen attitudes towards refugee communities manipulated for various ends.\n\n‘Still Alive’ does not shy away from uncomfortable and difficult questions; bringing together the voices and art of refugees and their advocates with a forensic account of Australian refugee policy. It evokes the idea of horror in art and music as a motif to convey the idea of abjection and to portray the impact it has upon the mental and physical health of those caught in the system.\n\nThe work is illustrated in black and white, however it refuses to take a similarly binary approach to its subject matter. Instead, the moral and ethical questions raised are treated with nuance; refugees are neither valorised nor demonised but are portrayed as humans; messy, complex and lost as they struggle to maintain their connections and a sense of self in a system designed to silence and conceal their stories.\n\nTowards the end of the work, Ahmed asks the reader; “As an Australian citizen, aren’t I implicated in the abuses of my government? Aren’t we all?” It is this feature of the book – the way it raises significant questions of culpability without didacticism or judgement, and asks the readers to carefully consider their own standpoint – that makes it an important and powerful piece of cultural memory. As a work of literature ‘Still Alive’ is a significant contribution to the ongoing national conversation.\n\n100 Remarkable Feats of Xander Maze\n\nClayton Zane Comber\n\nShortlist year: 2022\n\nShortlist category: Young adult literature\n\nPublished by: HarperCollins Publishers: Angus & Robertson\n\nXander Maze loves lists, and his grandmother is #1 on his list of People I Love Most in the World. But now that Nanna has stage 4 cancer, can a new list of 100 Remarkable Feats really save her?\n\nParticularly when his list contains difficult things like #2 Make a Friend and #3 Make a Best Friend – plus #10 Kiss a Girl (preferably Ally Collins, the girl of Xander’s dreams).\n\nFunny, moving and with a protagonist you can’t help but fall in love with, ‘100 Remarkable Feats of Xander Maze’ is a book about:\n\nnever accepting the unacceptable\n\nthe power of lists\n\none boy’s unconditional love for his nanna.\n\nClayton Zane Comber\n\nClayton Zane Comber is a writer from the South Coast of NSW who has held many varied roles, including a lawyer, optical dispenser, club DJ, creative writing tutor and saxophonist in a Chinese restaurant.\n\nHe received his MA from Sydney University, before studying in the UK and graduating from Oxford University with distinction for his Master’s in Creative Writing.\n\nIn 2017, Clayton’s varied roles eventuated in him opening Bouquiniste Bookstore Cafe Wine Bar, where he is the licensee, book curator, occasional DJ and head dishwasher.\n\nHis debut novel, ‘Shooting Stars’, was published by Odyssey Books in 2011.\n\nJudges’ comments\n\nFifteen-year-old Xander Maze has a unique understanding of the world and struggles with small talk “– talk which has no guidance or purpose”. He also needs his grandmother, who has terminal cancer, to live. So, when his grandma suggests that Xander should compile a list of one hundred acts, big or small, to help her and enhance his life, Xander believes his list will save her life.\n\nHe dives in, adding things like “assist police with an investigation, drive a car, stand up to Tyson Hunt and Corey Timms, remember something about dad, add memories to my memory list”, a clever technique that provides the reader with both story direction and clues to who Xander is, and who he wants to be. When his grandma posts the list publicly, Xander’s structured and literal world is blown wide open and two wonderfully smart and quirky outcasts are invited in. With their help, and with every feat Xander ticks off his list, he inches ever closer to being himself in a world where he is easily misunderstood. And the path to get there is much more remarkable than just a list. Like the book itself, it is full of heart, kindness and compassion, and celebrates the courage one must find to stand up for oneself, and for what is right.\n\nTell Me Why for Young Adults\n\nArchie Roach\n\nShortlist year: 2022\n\nShortlist category: Young adult literature\n\nPublished by: Simon & Schuster Australia\n\n‘There are many Australian stories, and mine is just one about what happened to me and other First Peoples of this country. It’s important for me to tell my story – because it’s not just part of my healing but of this country’s as well. We all have a story and as you read this book I would like you to think of your own story, what that means and who is also a part of your story.’\n\nIn his inspirational, highly acclaimed memoir – and including reflections from First Nations Elders and young people – Archie Roach tells the story of his life and his music. Only two when he was forcibly removed from his family, and brought up by a series of foster parents until his early teens, Archie’s world imploded when he received a letter that spoke of a life he had no memory of. It took him almost a lifetime to find out who he really was.\n\n‘Tell Me Why’ is an unforgettable story of resilience, strength of spirit and hope.\n\nArchie Roach\n\nArchie Roach’s song ‘Took the Children Away’ won an International Human Rights Achievement Award and his first album Charcoal Lane featured in US Rolling Stone magazine’s Top 50 in 1992, going gold in Australia and winning two ARIA awards. Archie’s recording history – including 12 albums, soundtracks, film and theatrical scores – has been hugely successful, hitting ARIA charts and winning awards, year in, year out. (Since publication of ‘Tell Me Why’ the author has passed away).\n\nJudges’ comments\n\n‘Tell Me Why for Young Adults’ is the heart-wrenching abridged version of Archie Roach’s highly acclaimed memoir. Archie Roach relates the experience of what happened to him and other First Nations People in our contemporary times. He implores us to think of our own story as he tells of his, both tragic and uplifting, through his life and music.\n\nThe book is framed by his musical lyrics and, opening with ‘Took the Children Away’, each chapter is a tribute to his resilience in overcoming trauma that is still being felt by his children and grandchildren – shared with his great love, musician Ruby Hunter. In this edition he asks both elders and young people to tell their own stories of stolen generations.\n\nIt takes almost a lifetime for Archie Roach to discover who he is. Throughout his journey, he questions why he and other children were forcibly taken (stolen) from their families and put into mission and foster homes. ‘Tell Me Why’ is a story of intergenerational trauma, resilience, strength of purpose, consequence and connection, that ultimately speaks of hope, belonging, and healing.\n\nIn this edition, Archie Roach has gifted us a deeper yet accessible understanding of the impact of colonial policy on Aboriginal & Torres Strait Islander peoples, and on the lives of young people in particular. Told with grace and dignity, his story shares how these challenges can be addressed by connection to country, people and family through music, storytelling, conviction and love.\n\nTiger Daughter\n\nRebecca Lim\n\nShortlist year: 2022\n\nShortlist category: Young adult literature\n\nPublished by: Allen & Unwin\n\nWhat I feel most days is that nothing is ever going to change. That my life won’t even start, and that I’ll be stuck like this forever.\n\nWen Zhou is the daughter and only child of Chinese immigrants whose move to the lucky country has proven to be not so lucky. Wen and her friend, Henry Xiao – whose mum and dad are also struggling immigrants – both dream of escape from their unhappy circumstances, and form a plan to sit an entrance exam to a selective high school far from home. But when tragedy strikes, it will take all of Wen’s resilience and resourcefulness to get herself and Henry through the storm that follows.\n\n‘Tiger Daughter’ is a novel that will grab hold of you and not let go.\n\nRebecca Lim\n\nRebecca Lim is an Australian writer, illustrator, editor and lawyer. She is the author of over twenty books, including ‘The Astrologer’s Daughter’, a Kirkus Best Book of 2015 and CBCA Notable Book for Older Readers, ‘Wraith’ and the internationally bestselling ‘Mercy’. Rebecca is a co-founder of the Voices from the Intersection initiative to support emerging young adult and children’s authors and illustrators who are First Nations, People of Colour, LGBTIQA+ or living with disability, and is a co-editor of ‘Meet Me at the Intersection’, a groundbreaking anthology of YA #OwnVoice memoir, poetry and fiction.\n\nJudges’ comments\n\nWen is the only child of Chinese immigrants. In many ways her family’s move to this country has been a disappointing experience, especially for Wen’s father who, unable to practice medicine in Australia, is now forced to “make do” as the maitre-d at a Chinese restaurant. His frustration, humiliation and bitterness manifests itself as domestic tyranny, with Wen and her mother living in constant fear of his anger, sullenness and iron-fisted control. So, when Wen and her mother try to bring some comfort to Wen’s friend Henry and his father, who have suffered unthinkable loss, something has to make way – either Wen’s fealty to her father and his rage, or the deeply held sense of human kindness that she shares with her mother.\n\nAt first glance, it may be tempting to categorise this compelling and assured book by a writer with strong pedigree as another insight into the immigrant experience told through the eyes of a young adult. However, it is more than that. It is at once a tense account of a family in crisis, a touching depiction of friendship and empathy, and a moving celebration of personal courage, and its conclusion leaves the reader with a sense of optimism that no one ever need be seen as a lost cause.\n\nSemut: The untold story of a secret Australian operation in WWII Borneo (Winner)\n\nChristine Helliwell\n\nShortlist year: 2022\n\nShortlist category: Australian history\n\nPublished by: Penguin Random House Australia: Michael Joseph\n\nMarch 1945. A handful of young Allied operatives are parachuted into the remote jungled heart of the Japanese-occupied island of Borneo, east of Singapore, there to recruit the island’s indigenous Dayak peoples to fight the Japanese. Yet most have barely encountered Asian or indigenous people before, speak next to no Borneo languages, and know little about Dayaks, other than that they have been – and may still be – headhunters. They fear that on arrival the Dayaks will kill them or hand them over to the Japanese. For their part, some Dayaks have never before seen a white face.\n\nSo begins the story of Operation Semut, an Australian secret operation launched by the organisation codenamed Services Reconnaisance Department – popularly known as Z Special Unit – in the final months of WWII. Anthropologist Christine Helliwell has called on her years of first-hand knowledge of Borneo, interviewed more than one hundred Dayak people and all the remaining Semut operatives, and consulted thousands of military and other documents to piece together this astonishing story. Focusing on the operation’s activities along two of Borneo’s great rivers – the Baram and Rejang – the book provides a detailed military history of Semut II’s and Semut III’s brutal guerrilla campaign against the Japanese, and reveals the decisive but long-overlooked Dayak role in the operation.\n\nBut this is no ordinary history. Helliwell captures vividly the sounds, smells and tastes of the jungles into which the operatives are plunged, an environment so terrifying that many are unsure whether jungle or Japanese is the greater enemy. And she takes us into the lives and cavernous longhouses of the Dayaks on whom their survival depends. The result is a truly unique account of the encounter between two very different cultures amidst the savagery of the Pacific War.\n\nChristine Helliwell\n\nChristine Helliwell is a New Zealand-born anthropologist, author and academic, currently Emeritus Professor at the Australian National University. She has been carrying out research on Borneo’s indigenous Dayak peoples – including living with them in their communities for months at a time – for almost forty years, and has written widely on Dayak social and cultural life.\n\nChristine lives in Canberra. Her book ‘Semut’ – on the most important of the Borneo ‘Z’ operations – took her almost four years to write.\n\nJudges’ comments\n\n‘Semut’ is a work of great narrative power that goes directly to the heart of Australia’s place and identity in the Southeast Asian region. Helliwell marries military history and anthropology to bring to vivid life the secret guerrilla campaign Australia’s Z Special Unit launched against the Japanese in Borneo in March 1945. In particular, she documents the neglected but crucial role played by Borneo’s Dayak peoples, who risked devastating retribution to take up arms against the Japanese and to shelter, protect and guide Australian operatives.\n\nWithout this support, Helliwell makes clear, Semut would have failed at the outset, its operatives perishing quickly in the island’s rugged jungle interior.\n\n‘Semut’ is a deeply researched work, harnessing a forensic interrogation of existing reports and thousands of official records, new interviews with Dayak and Allied survivors, and expert knowledge of Dayak culture acquired over decades. The result is a seamless, gripping, and visceral narrative history that transports the reader between Borneo’s punishing jungle environment, the capacious Dayak longhouses located along its majestic rivers, and the atmosphere of fear, tension and rivalry surrounding the Australian operation. Helliwell’s revelations regarding the role of headhunting in securing Dayak support for guerrilla campaign are among the most remarkable in a work that illuminates our enduring debt to all who contributed to the wartime Allied cause.\n\nFarmers or Hunter-gatherers? The Dark Emu debate\n\nProfessor Peter Sutton FASSA, Dr Keryn Walshe\n\nShortlist year: 2022\n\nShortlist category: Australian history\n\nPublished by: Melbourne University Press\n\nAustralians’ understanding of Aboriginal society prior to the British invasion from 1788 has been transformed since the publication of Bruce Pascoe’s ‘Dark Emu’ in 2014. It argued that classical Aboriginal society was more sophisticated than Australians had been led to believe because it resembled more closely the farming communities of Europe. In Farmers or Hunter-gatherers? Peter Sutton and Keryn Walshe ask why Australians have been so receptive to the notion that farming represents an advance from hunting and gathering. Drawing on the knowledge of Aboriginal elders, previously not included within this discussion, and decades of anthropological scholarship, Sutton and Walshe provide extensive evidence to support their argument that classical Aboriginal society was a hunter-gatherer society and as sophisticated as the traditional European farming methods. ‘Farmers or Hunter-gatherers?’ asks Australians to develop a deeper understanding and appreciation of Aboriginal society and culture.\n\nAbout the author: Professor Peter Sutton FASSA\n\nProfessor Peter Sutton FASSA is a social anthropologist and linguist who has, over more than 50 years, contributed to learning and recording Aboriginal languages, promoting Aboriginal art, mapping Aboriginal cultural landscapes, increasing understanding of contemporary Aboriginal societies and land tenure systems, and the successes of native title claimants.\n\nAbout the author: Dr Keryn Walshe\n\nDr Keryn Walshe is an archaeologist with more than 35 years of experience in recording, analysing and interpreting Australian Indigenous heritage sites and objects. She has lectured in archaeology, managed Indigenous heritage museum collections and undertaken site assessments for corporate and government agencies. Walshe continues to write for academic journals, advise heritage managers and give public presentations.\n\nJudges’ comments\n\nWhile many Aboriginal Australians were appalled by Bruce Pascoe’s ‘Dark Emu’ it took seven years for a full response from the Academy. Anthropologist Professor Peter Sutton and archaeologist Dr Keryn Walshe last year responded to a publishing phenomenon with hard facts, life-times of expertise and science. Although ‘Dark Emu’ won literary awards and garnered a place on some school curricula for its children’s version, ‘Young Dark Emu’, many Aboriginal people saw the flaw in Pascoe’s development of earlier works by Bill Gammage and Rolf Gerritsen that had examined Aboriginal land management techniques. Sure, the Old People may have known more about how to manage their land than earlier generations of white Australians understood. But the Old People were of the land. They were part of it through their Dreaming stories. Their traditional increase ceremonies had nothing to do with European attitudes to the creation of wealth and the taming of the land. Yet Pascoe’s was a world where Aboriginal people were judged more kindly because they too seemed to have the need of Europeans to master their environment and create prosperity. ‘Farmers or Hunter-gatherers? The Dark Emu Debate’ is a rigorous take-down of a work that has somehow made white Australians feel good about themselves by making Aboriginal life seem more European. Sutton is a highly respected anthropologist and his earlier work on Aboriginal Australia, ‘The Politics of Suffering’, is a classic. In this book he and Walshe challenge their disciplines in the academy, correct ‘Dark Emu’s’ misuse of the historical record of the early explorers and, most importantly, explain Aboriginal life as it really was without using Pascoe pejoratives such as “primitive” to describe the complexity of the Aboriginal world.\n\nReturn to Uluru\n\nMark McKenna\n\nShortlist year: 2022\n\nShortlist category: Australian history\n\nPublished by: Schwartz Books: Black Inc.\n\nA killing. A hidden history. A story that goes to the heart of the nation.\n\nWhen Mark McKenna set out to write a history of the centre of Australia, he had no idea what he would discover. One event in 1934 – the shooting at Uluru of Aboriginal man Yokununna by white policeman Bill McKinnon, and subsequent Commonwealth inquiry – stood out as a mirror of racial politics in the Northern Territory at the time.\n\nBut then, through speaking with the families of both killer and victim, McKenna unearthed new evidence that transformed the historical record and the meaning of the event for today. As he explains, ‘Every thread of the story connected to the present in surprising ways.’ In a sequence of powerful revelations, McKenna explores what truth-telling and reconciliation look like in practice.\n\nReturn to Uluru brings a cold case to life. It speaks directly to the Black Lives Matter movement, but is completely Australian. Recalling Chloe Hooper’s ‘The Tall Man’, it is superbly written, moving, and full of astonishing, unexpected twists. Ultimately it is a story of recognition and return, which goes to the very heart of the country. At the centre of it all is Uluru, the sacred site where paths fatefully converged.\n\nMark McKenna\n\nMark McKenna is one of Australia’s leading historians, based at the University of Sydney. He is the author of several prize-winning books, including ‘From the Edge: Australia’s Lost Histories’, ‘Looking for Blackfellas’ Point’ and ‘An Eye for Eternity: The Life of Manning Clark’, which won the Prime Minister’s Literary Award for nonfiction and the Victorian, New South Wales, Queensland and South Australian premiers’ awards.\n\nJudges’ comments\n\nThis book interweaves an inseparable history. In 2017, a descendant of an escapee from a killing gave permission to use the name Uluru for the ‘Statement from the Heart’, which is pictorially embraced by the Dreaming story of Kuniya (python) and Liru (snake). In 1934 at the sacred cave in the rock face depicting the shield of Liru, McKinnon, a policeman shot and killed Yokununna, an Anangu man. At the enquiry he said he shot without taking aim. When White Australians first came to Uluru they recognised its transcendence comparing it to the great European cathedrals, though not understanding its sacredness for the Anangu. By the 1950s tourists visited the ‘red heart’ and the remaining Anangu integrated with a tourist economy. Visitors climbed the rock as a pilgrimage. The Anangu contested this desecration by ‘ants’. Uluru returned to Aboriginal ownership in 1985, and in 2019 the climb up the rock was prohibited. Remarkably, McKinnon’s original journal, found by the author in a garage, said he fired to hit. He had lied. McKinnon’s family ‘are on board for reconciliation’. While Anangu respect Yokununna’s bravery, they are sad and angry at the fact that McKinnon killed him and that his remains were taken away. More importantly, they are inspired by the sacredness of the land where it occurred.\n\nWhite Russians, Red Peril: A Cold War history of migration to Australia\n\nSheila Fitzpatrick\n\nShortlist year: 2022\n\nShortlist category: Australian history\n\nPublished by: La Trobe University Press in conjunction with Black Inc.\n\nA gripping account of the paths that led postwar Russian migrants to Australia – and what they found when they arrived.\n\nMore than 20,000 ethnic Russians migrated to Australia after the Second World War – yet we know very little about their experiences. Some came via China, others from refugee camps in Europe.\n\nMany of the refugees who came from Europe preferred to keep a low profile in Australia, and some tried to ‘pass’ as Polish, West Ukrainian or Yugoslavian. They had good reason to do so: to the Soviet Union, Australia’s resettling of Russians amounted to the theft of its citizens, and undercover agents were deployed to persuade them to repatriate. Australia regarded the newcomers with wary suspicion, even as it sought to build its population by opening its doors to immigrants.\n\nMaking use of newly discovered Russian-language archives and drawing on a lifetime’s study of Soviet history and politics, acclaimed author Sheila Fitzpatrick examines the early years of a diverse Russian-Australian community and how Australian and Soviet intelligence agencies attempted to track and influence them. While anti-communist ‘White’ Russians dreamed a war of liberation would overthrow the Soviet regime, a dissident minority admired its achievements and thought of returning home. This is immigration history at its vivid, grounded best.\n\nSheila Fitzpatrick\n\nSheila Fitzpatrick is the multi-award-winning author of ‘My Father’s Daughter’, ‘Mischka’s War’, ‘On Stalin’s Team’ and ”The Russian Revolution, among other titles. She is a regular contributor to the London Review of Books.\n\nJudges’ comments\n\nThis book tells the story of Russian migration from Europe and China to Australia in the aftermath of World War II. It delves into archives, recounts family histories and memoirs, draws on journals and newspapers, and uses fresh interviews. The result is a fascinating look into an overlooked period of Australian history as the new migrants looked for jobs, purchased houses, raised families, joined social clubs and the church, and (often) became Australian. Fitzpatrick, who has written extensively on the Soviet Union, and accesses archives around the world, uses individual lives to tell a larger story of Cold War fear, hostility, suspicion and everyday experiences. Some were prisoners of war and displaced persons, or Nazi collaborators, while others were anti-communists eager to flee the Soviet Union or China. These new migrants aroused the interest of Soviet diplomats who pressured them to return. Australian Security Intelligence Organisation also took an active interest in this emerging immigrant community. Fitzpatrick estimates that Russian migrants to Australia numbered around 25,000 between 1945 and 1960 yet their stories have too often been overlooked.\n\nHarlem Nights: The secret history of Australia’s Jazz Age\n\nDeirdre O’Connell\n\nShortlist year: 2022\n\nShortlist category: Australian history\n\nPublished by: Melbourne University Press\n\nThe 1920s were a time of wonder and flux, when Australians sensed a world growing smaller, turning faster-and, for some, skittering off balance. American movies, music and dance brought together what racial lines kept apart. A spirit of youthful rebellion collided with the promise of racial perfectibility, stirring deep anxieties in white nationalists and moral reformers. African-American jazz represented the type of modernism that cosmopolitan Australians craved-and the champions of White Australia feared. Enter Sonny Clay’s Colored Idea. Snuck in under the wire by an astute promoter, the Harlem-style revue broke from the usual blackface minstrel fare, delivering sophisticated, liberating rhythms. The story of their Australian tour is a tale of conspiracy – a secret plan to kick out and keep out ‘undesirable’ expressions of modernism, music and race. From the wild jazz clubs of Prohibition-era Los Angeles to Indigenous women discovering a new world of black resistance, this anatomy of a scandal-fuelled frame-up brings into focus a vibrant cast of characters from Australia’s Jazz Age.\n\nDeirdre O’Connell\n\nDeirdre O’Connell is an historian, teacher and author of ‘The Ballad of Blind Tom’. She has a background in environmental journalism and music documentary and lives in the Blue Mountains on Gundungurra and Darug land.\n\nJudges’ comments\n\n‘Harlem Nights’ begins almost innocuously. “This is a story,” writes Deidre O’Connell, “of an Australian political conspiracy.” While that is certainly true – in rich detail she uncovers the political controversy precipitating the expulsion from Australia of Sonny Clay’s African American jazz orchestra – ‘Harlem Nights’ is so much more. Clay’s arrival in Sydney in January 1928 set alarm bells ringing immediately. For ten weeks Clay and his troupe were at the centre of a political storm that exposed the cultural chasm between Australians determined to defend the prevailing order and those intent on challenging what they regarded as the stifling influence of Victorian-era values. To its local detractors, jazz represented decadence, moral decay and the pernicious influence of American culture – about which Australians were already deeply ambivalent. The debate over jazz was thus part of a much deeper contest between tradition and modernity. This book is a historical ‘tour-de-force’, highlighting both the heady excitement of the 1920s and the racial and sexual tensions that were never far from the surface in a still-resolutely White Australia. Asking big questions in small places, O’Connell has written a wonderfully textured history of an Australia deeply uncertain of both its own identity and its place in the world.\n\nHuman Looking (Winner)\n\nAndy Jackson\n\nShortlist year: 2022\n\nShortlist category: Poetry\n\nPublished by: Giramondo Publishing Company\n\nThe poems in ‘Human Looking’ speak with the voices of the disabled and the disfigured, in ways which are confronting, but also illuminating and tender. They speak of surgical interventions, and of the different kinds of disability which they seek to ‘correct’. They range widely, finding figures to identify with in mythology and history, art and photography, poetry and fiction. A number of poems deal with unsettling extremes of embodiment, and with violence against disabled people. Others emerge out of everyday life, and the effects of illness, pain and prejudice. The strength of the speaking voice is remarkable, as is its capacity for empathy and love. ‘I, this wonderful catastrophe’, the poet has Mary Shelley’s monstrous figure declare. The use of unusual and disjunctive – or ‘deformed’ – poetic forms, adds to the emotional impact of the poems.\n\nAndy Jackson\n\nAndy Jackson’s first collection, ‘Among the Regulars’, was shortlisted for the 2011 Kenneth Slessor Prize for Poetry; in 2020 his collection ‘Music Our Bodies Can’t Hold’ was shortlisted for the John Bray Poetry Award; and in 2022 his collection ‘Human Looking’ was shortlisted for the Victorian Premier’s Literary Awards. He has featured at literary events and arts festivals in Ireland, India, the USA and across Australia, and has co-edited disability-themed issues of the literary journals Southerly and Australian Poetry Journal. Andy Jackson works as a creative writing teacher and tutor for community organisations and universities.\n\nJudges’ comments\n\nIn ‘Human Looking’ Jackson shows he has a highly distinctive poetic voice, and writes with great technical skill and variety. Starting with its ambiguous title, Jackson’s book is an extraordinary poetic exploration of his own disability – Marfan’s syndrome, which is disfiguring and distorts the shape of his face and body. His poems are blistering in their power, wonderfully subtle, objective and with no self-pity. The first poem in this book ‘Opening’ plunges straight in to the main subject, and deals with corrective surgery – the long incision, which his condition required. But Jackson does not stop with the physical incision. He confesses “the long suture ruptures/ in my head – the scar remaining open.” What happens to our bodies becomes our mind. Astonishingly he takes this yet one step further. Through his poem, Jackson tells us, you the reader “are becoming/ this unstitching, this sudden opening.” Jackson does not falsely valorise suffering – suffering is suffering – but it opens us. He is able to rise above it, feel love and empathy, and accept himself. In his poem ‘Borne away by distance’, referring to Mary Shelley’s ‘Frankenstein’, he writes of “I, this wonderful catastrophe . . . turning toward/ tremendous being.” Tremendous indeed. And beautiful.\n\nHomecoming\n\nElfie Shiosaki\n\nShortlist year: 2022\n\nShortlist category: Poetry\n\nPublished by: Magabala Books\n\n‘Homecoming’ pieces together fragments of stories about four generations of Noongar women and explores how they navigated the changing landscapes of colonisation, protectionism, and assimilation to hold their families together.\n\nThis seminal collection of poetry, prose and historical colonial archives, tells First Nations truths of unending love for children—those that were present, those taken, those hidden and those that ultimately stood in the light.\n\n‘Homecoming’ speaks to the intergenerational dialogue about Country, kin and culture. This elegant and extraordinary form of restorative story work amplifies Aboriginal women’s voices, and enables four generations of women to speak for themselves. This sublime debut highlights the tenacity of family as well as First Nation’s agency to resist, survive and renew.\n\nElfie Shiosaki has restored humanity and power to her family in this beautifully articulated collection and has given voice to those silenced by our brutal past.\n\nElfie Shiosaki\n\nElfie Shiosaki is a Noongar and Yawuru writer. She is an Associate Professor at the College of Arts and Social Sciences at the Australian National University. Her research and teaching explores Indigenous desires for human rights and self-determination. She was the Editor of Indigenous Writing at Westerly from 2017 to 2021.\n\nJudges’ comments\n\nTo tell the story of her Noongar ancestors over several generations, Shiosaki’s ‘Homecoming’ movingly combines eloquent short prose poems with archival material, including recorded oral histories and letters, deftly excerpted in short extracts that read like poems. She has described how some of the stories in her book “are held in my imagination”. Others “are fragments of the many stars in my grandmothers’ constellations. I track my grandmothers’ stars to find my bidi home.” (“Bidi” is a Noongar word meaning “track”.) Shiosaki’s narrative line shifts backwards and forwards through time, evoking her ancestors’ dispossession, their love for the children who were forcibly removed from them, and reproducing extracts from their remarkable letters protesting about the “brutality” of “inhuman whites” who had authority over them. ‘Homecoming’ has a quiet, deeply involving power and beauty, with the various parts coming together as a poetic ‘libre composé’. Convincing with its restraint, it avoids ready-made answers. The final prose poem ‘Which Way’ describes Koorlang (the child) wading into water, shaded by paperbarks, and immersing herself more deeply, so that she was “gently cradled . . . in loving arms”. The poem concludes: “Unafraid, she remained still, not knowing which way was the light, and which way was the darkness.”\n\nDancing with Stephen Hawking\n\nJohn Foulcher\n\nShortlist year: 2022\n\nShortlist category: Poetry\n\nPublished by: Pitt Street Poetry\n\nThis new collection of poems from magisterial Australian poet John Foulcher celebrates his recent transition from a busy working life in Canberra to the rural tranquillity of a new home — a rescued church in a tiny village south of Braidwood.\n\nIn the transition his writing takes on new depth, new breadth, new worlds, as from that quiet corner he contemplates an extended, brooding photographic sequence first encountered in London, a brief visit to a Greek island and an even briefer trip to the moon. As always in his work: aging, death, the conundrums of faith. And the transcendent importance of a momentary frenetic boogie with a quantum physicist in a wheelchair:\n\n…I thought of the atoms in my eye,\n\nspinning and spinning, and the torrent of light\n\nsurging through me, soaking me to the bone\n\nas I stood looking up, with my bloodied knees.\n\nJohn Foulcher\n\nJohn Foulcher graduated from Macquarie University with a Bachelor of Arts with Honours and a Diploma of Education. He has been a teacher in NSW and the ACT.\n\nHis work has been widely anthologised and published in national newspapers and journals including The Age, The Australian, The Sydney Morning Herald, The Bulletin, Quadrant, Heat, Poetry Australia and Meanjin.\n\nHis poetry is described by the Oxford Companion to Australian Literature as ‘simple, direct and convincing’.\n\nJudges’ comments\n\nJohn Foulcher’s ‘Dancing with Stephen Hawking’ has all the wild comedy its title suggests. Foulcher is acrobatically comic, with a sense of the ludicrous that touches sublimity—because there is such a reviving deployment of craft to take the mickey out of the grand signposts of the popular culture inside which we dwell.\n\nJohn Foulcher is everywhere aware of the absurdity inherent in the mythologies without which we cannot live. He is an effortlessly urbane poet, dry when he is not hilarious. He has a scathing honesty which gives equilibrium to a technical expertise that emphasises with an enviable smoothness of effect the kind of jokes and poignancies that language can achieve (rather than what can be done to language).\n\n‘Dancing with Stephen Hawking’ is a companionable book—because it is so inward with the world of collective experience that its shocks of recognition are laugh-aloud when he’s playfully parading an infatuation with rockstars, and have a telling truth when he touches on grief and destruction with such a poker face.\n\nFish Work\n\nCaitlin Maling\n\nShortlist year: 2022\n\nShortlist category: Poetry\n\nPublished by: UWA Publishing\n\nAt the Bottom of It, Pain\n\nCallie tries to give the fish a good death,\n\nshort and sharp, severing the brain stem.\n\nPithing – like the sound a cherry makes\n\nwhen you extract the pip. Some things\n\nare instinct like spitting out\n\nwhat cracks, hard, against your teeth,\n\nor how a fusilier in the net arches\n\nits whole body like a rictus grin\n\nwhen the fruit is sour.\n\n‘Fish Work’ brings the great barrier reef into poetic focus, exploring not just the fish that occupy the reefs but that vast variety of life-forms – including human – that make the reef a uniquely diverse environment. Developed over three years of field-work, during which time the poet lived and worked alongside marine researchers, ‘Fish Work’ asks us to reconsider what it means to live with other beings, human and extra-than-human.\n\nBlending the language of scientific research with the language of popular culture and her familiar conversational register, ‘Fish Work’ is unlike any other book of poetry available in Australia.\n\nThis collection represents the first dedicated poetic investigation into the Great Barrier Reef in a time a climate change, paying particular attention to the far northern Great Barrier Reef, specifically Lizard Island Research Station where the poet spent several months over several years undergoing fieldwork with the scientific researchers in residence.\n\nCaitlin Maling\n\nCaitlin Maling is a Western Australian poet with three previously published collections of poetry out through Fremantle Press. In 2019 she was awarded her doctorate in literature from University of Sydney. Her poetry and non-fiction has been published widely through Australia, the US and the UK. She is the previous recipient of the Marten Bequest in poetry and grants from the Australia Council and the Department of Culture and the Arts, Western Australia.\n\nJudges’ comments\n\n‘Fishwork’ by Caitlin Maling is simply a charmer of a work which makes it a singular book of poetry because it discloses the world of the Barrier Reef and all the fish that surround it and swim in it and give it the vibrant quality of a living and beautiful thing even as it is imperilled. This is a neat and highly skilled piece of poetry as documentary just as it is a lyrically articulated chronicle of attractive things and shifting things in the kaleidoscope of an exotic but pictorially precise representation of a world. It is a book that will command a large readership because it is flawlessly written and it has such an easy, beautifully phrased and lightly coloured sense of the lilt and colour of life. Typical of Maling’s friendly and ironical lyricism is ‘For Once There is Not a Sunset of Some Beauty’ – note the paradoxical title of her poem. Maling is walking along the beach at twilight, preceded by two thick-knees (wading birds with spotted plumage who are especially active at dawn and dusk):\n\nSome would call them pretty\n\nas the dusk descends\n\nbut I say\n\nwhat they are\n\nis almost a\n\nlanguage of shadows.\n\nFifteeners\n\nJordie Albiston\n\nShortlist year: 2022\n\nShortlist category: Poetry\n\nPublished by: Puncher & Wattmann\n\nThe sonnet is a classic lyric form that has beguiled and perplexed poets for over seven hundred years. In ‘Fifteeners’, award-winning poet Jordie Albiston re-invents the sonnet structure, trading meter for syllabics, and employing fifteen lines in lieu of the traditional fourteen. Themes of destruction and loss, hope and wonder, and the pressing fate of an unstable world, are coded like enduring questions into the machinery of these extraordinary poems. ‘Fifteeners’ is Albiston’s thirteenth collection of poetry.\n\nJordie Albiston\n\nJordie Albiston published thirteen poetry collections and a handbook on poetic form. Two of her books have been adapted for opera, both enjoying seasons at the Sydney Opera House. Albiston’s poetry has been recognised by prizes including the Mary Gilmore Award, the NSW Premier’s Prize, the John Bray Award and the Patrick White Literary Award. She has worked under Fellowships at the State Library of Victoria, the National Library (Canberra) and the Jamieson Library (Cornwall, UK).\n\nAlbiston works within formal boundaries: traditional, experimental, or self-imposed. She seeks the musical cadence while endeavouring to exact a mathematical sense of existence. (Since publication of ‘Fifteeners’, the author has passed away).\n\nJudges’ comments\n\nJordie Albiston’s ‘Fifteeners’ is an exceptionally accomplished series of mutated sonnets which are dextrous and formally elaborated to an exceptional degree with a marvellous intricacy of patterning and extraordinary feats of internal rhyme. To say the book is masterly in technique is, however, if left to stand alone, a distortion of the intensity Albiston gets from her virtuosity and the way in which a book that begins with very patterned and recursive quotations from the mystic Julian of Norwich manages to be a rigorous and meditative examination of selfhood and its transcendence. This is a poetry whose lyricism is so powerfully and elaborately patterned that it comes across with the blinding power of great devotional poetry, even though it encompasses motherhood and fears of a material apocalypse. This is a poetry of great cumulative force in which the self-possession of the poet would seem absolute were it not for the interventions of every encroaching opposite: bearing a child, mayhem and the mystery of the darkness beyond. But this is a poetry of tremendous sensuous embodiment which is haunted at every point by the yearnings of the spirit.\n\n2021\n\nYoung adult literature\n\n[Winner] Metal Fish, Falling Snow – Cath Moore\n\nWhen Rain Turns to Snow – Jane Godwin\n\nThe F Team – Rawah Arja\n\nLoner – Georgina Young\n\nThe End of the World is Bigger than Love – Davina Bell\n\nPoetry\n\n[Winner] The Strangest Place, New and Selected Poems – Stephen Edgar\n\nHomer Street – Laurie Duggan\n\nChange Machine – Jaya Savige\n\nShorter Lives – John A Scott\n\nNothing to Declare – Mags Webster\n\nChildren’s literature\n\n[Winner] How to Make a Bird – Meg McKinlay, Illustrator: Matt Ottley\n\n[Winner] Fly on the Wall – Remy Lai\n\nThe Stolen Prince of Cloudburst – Jaclyn Moriarty, Illustrator: Kelly Canby\n\nThe January Stars – Kate Constable\n\nThe Year the Maps Changed – Danielle Binks\n\nFiction\n\n[Winner] The Labyrinth by Amanda Lohrey – Amanda Lohrey\n\nThe Bass Rock – Evie Wyld\n\nIn the Time of Foxes – Jo Lennan\n\nLucky’s – Andrew Pippos\n\nA Treacherous Country – Gabriel Fox\n\nNon-fiction\n\n[Winner] The Stranger Artist: Life at the Edge of Kimberley Painting – Quentin Sprague\n\nFlight Lines: Across the Globe on a Journey with the Astonishing Ultramarathon Birds – Andrew Darby\n\nThe Details: On Love, Death and Reading – Tegan Bennett Daylight\n\nTruganini: Journey Through the Apocalypse – Cassandra Pybus\n\nThe Altar Boys – Suzanne Smith\n\nAustralian history\n\n[Winner] People of the River: Lost Worlds of Early Australia – Grace Karskens\n\nThe Convict Valley: The Bloody Struggle on Australia’s Early Frontier – Mark Dunn\n\nRepresenting Australian Aboriginal Music and Dance 1930–1970 – Amanda Harris\n\nPathfinders: A History of Aboriginal Trackers in NSW – Michael Bennett\n\nCeremony Men: Making Ethnography and the Return of the Strehlow Collection – Jason M Gibson\n\n2020\n\nYoung adult literature\n\n[Winner] How it Feels to Float – Helena Fox\n\nThe Surprising Power of a Good Dumpling – Wai Chim\n\nThe Honeyman and the Hunter – Neil Grant\n\nThis Is How We Change the Ending – Vikki Wakefield\n\nWhen the Ground is Hard – Malla Nunn\n\nChildren’s literature\n\n[Winner] Cooee Mittigar: A Story on Darug Songlines – Jasmine Seymour.
