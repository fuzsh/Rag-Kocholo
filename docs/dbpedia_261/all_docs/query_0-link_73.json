        "text": "A Student Grammar of Spanish is a concise introduction to Spanish grammar, designed for English-speaking undergraduates. Assuming no prior knowledge of grammatical terminology, it explains each aspect of Spanish grammar in clear and simple terms, provides a wealth of glossed examples to illustrate them, and helps students to put their learning into practice through a range of fun and engaging exercises. Clearly organized into thirty units, each covering a different aspect of the grammar, the book functions both as an essential reference guide and as a comprehensive workbook. Individual topics can be looked up via a user-friendly cross-referencing system, and concise definitions are provided in a useful glossary of grammatical terms. The exercises, which include paired and group activities, are suitable for both classroom use and selfstudy. Each unit is split into two levels, basic and intermediate, making this grammar the perfect accompaniment to any first- or second-year undergraduate course. Ronald E. Batchelor has now retired from the University of Nottingham, where he taught French and Spanish for forty years. He has also held teaching posts at the universities of Besan¸con, France, and Valencia, Spain. He has published ten books, including Using Spanish: A Guide to Contemporary Usage (with Chris Pountain), Using Spanish Synonyms, Using Spanish Vocabulary, Using French and Using French Synonyms (all published by Cambridge University Press).\n\nA Student Grammar of Spanish\n\nRO NA L D E .

It is therefore a major world language, the fourth largest in terms of speakers. Its study thus offers all students a meaningful and attractive prospect of establishing contact with a very wide range of Spanish speakers coming from numerous countries. Any student of Spanish will benefit, both personally and culturally, from communication with such a vast array of people bound together by a common language. Spanish as a mother tongue unites countries as far apart as New York or London are from Pekin, but distance does not necessarily entail intractable difference. Surprising as it may seem, it is often as easy for an English-speaking student of Spanish to understand the Spanish of Mexico, Argentina, Colombia, Peru or Ecuador as it is for an English or American person to understand the language of some parts of Scotland, for instance, or for a Spanish speaker to understand the language of some regions of Andaluc´ıa. Any learner of Spanish will need, certainly in the early stages of contact with the language, a grammar book which assists her/him through the initial maze. Such a volume needs to appeal both to the beginner and to the student who has acquired some basic knowledge. The present book is designed precisely to cater for these differing needs, while bearing in mind the North American reader and his/her British counterpart. Furthermore, it must aim to include both Iberian Spanish and the Spanish of the Americas. This balancing act is not as delicate as it may first appear. Long experience has taught the present author that there is much more in the field of Spanish grammar that brings Spanish speakers together than separates them, while the differences between the English of the United Kingdom and of the United States need not be exaggerated. This book on Spanish grammar has therefore a general appeal which deals with most aspects of the grammar in a straightforward and uncomplicated way. It treats the grammatical structures of Spanish as expressed in Spain and Mexico. Mexico is taken as a model for the whole of Spanish America, since to attempt a comprehensive coverage of all Spanish America would serve little purpose, especially since the grammar, as apart from vocabulary, of Spanish differs little from one country to another. Mexican Spanish is one of the standard variants, partly due to the exportation of movies and telenovelas (soap operas), while it is unquestionably the most prevalent variety found in the South West of the United States. M indicates that the word or structure is specifically Mexican while it may be confidently assumed that, where M does not appear, usage is Iberian but will be understood and even used in Mexico, as well as in most of the other Spanish-speaking countries in the Americas. A simple illustration of a Mexican alternative may be seen in\n\nvii\n\nPreface\n\nsome of the headings to exercises where to fill in blank spaces is translated as rellenar los blancos for Iberian Spanish and llenar los espacios for Mexican Spanish. This volume covers all major grammatical points of Spanish in a user-friendly and direct way, and recognizes that humor is part of the learning process. You’ll learn much more if you study with a smile, while Mexicans lead the way in the field of humor. The present author learnt a lot from Cantinflas, the Mexican comedian. All the points are presented in an easily accessible way, and are reinforced, at every phase and after each level, by exercises, while suggested solutions to these exercises can be found at the end of the book. Some exercises are short, some much longer, and some involve the student in role play, a well-tried method for developing linguistic skills, and in games such as puzzles. A fun element is central to the concept and genesis of the book. There are paired or group exercises in both levels of nearly every unit. They encourage you to use and speak Spanish. You’ll be surprised how much progress you make by insisting on speaking the language. It is difficult to suggest the amount of time needed for these particular exercises since the author does not want to be prescriptive. Often, a time of five minutes is suggested for preparing yourself for the exercise but teachers/instructors have their constraints. All the exercises in level 1 have instructions in English. To reflect the more advanced work in level 2, the instructions are in Spanish. Naturally enough, the exercises are more demanding and challenging in the second level than in the first. But the key is there to help you out. Of course, use the key wisely. Don’t take a peek at the answers until you have really tried to deal with the exercise in question. Examples are often presented in the feminine form. The text avoids sexist bias and reaches out to females and males alike. The treatment of each grammatical area follows a very clear pattern. Basic points are covered, logically, at the beginning, and are separated off from the more advanced grammatical features. The book is thus divided into two levels by an image where the climbing of stairs representing letters suggests more progressive work. It should be emphasized that the present work is a self-help book, and does not require the constant presence of, or reference to, a teacher. Furthermore, constant crossreferencing should help the student to gain a clear and more rounded picture of all the grammatical points. American English takes precedence over British English. American spelling is preferred to its English counterpart but this should present no problem whatever to the nonAmerican learner. Where there could be lexical misinterpretation, both American and British terms appear side by side. The book contains a “Glossary of grammatical terms” which will help you understand any semi-technical grammatical expressions you may have difficulty with. Use this glossary regularly to familiarize yourself with the terms used in the text. It is so much easier to come to grips with the grammar of a foreign language if you gain some insight into the way that even the English language functions. The text also has a comprehensive index designed to direct you to any particular point of grammar or vocabulary you wish to consult. The book is up-to-date. For instance, you will come across a section on the problems of gender now that females are working in fields once inaccessible to them. Compound nouns, once unusual in Spanish, except for just a few, are springing up like mushrooms, and the text pays serious attention to them. viii\n\nPreface\n\nThe word “grammar” often has a daunting resonance, but it is by making your way through the intricate web of grammatical structures and conquering the foreign way in which Spanish speakers express themselves, that you will not only derive intellectual satisfaction from your achievements but also emotional enjoyment from what is, in the final analysis, the desire to establish a permanent and worthwhile association with a dominant world culture.\n\nix\n\nAcknowledgments\n\nI am deeply indebted to Dr. J. P´erez Larracilla, Mexican colleague and friend, for his sure and indigenous knowledge of Mexican Spanish and his permanent willingness to offer me advice and information whenever needed. The book has also greatly benefited from the myriad comments and suggestions of my colleague Dr. Tim McGovern. Let us not forget all the Spanish speakers who have patiently and accurately responded over the years to a continual bombardment of questions. However hard I try, and I have tried numerous times, I cannot produce a perfect text. But help is always at hand in the form of my copy-editor, Leigh Mueller, who has performed her customary and exemplary trick of ironing out all my inconsistencies and improving on the presentation of the work.\n\nx\n\nGlossary of grammatical terms\n\nACCENT\n\nADJECTIVE\n\nA D J E C T I VE, DEMONSTRATIVE ADVERB\n\nAGENT\n\nAGREEMENT\n\nANTECEDENT\n\nSign written over a letter, often a V O W E L , at least in ˜ (here over a consonant, Spanish, e.g. caf´e, corrio´ (ran), Espana ¨ (may check) (see D I E R E S I S ). A C C E N T see T I L D E ), averigue is often confused with S T R E S S . See S T R E S S A word that describes a N O U N . It agrees with the noun it qualifies, e.g. una casa hermosa, nubes grises, un chico alto (a lovely house, grey clouds, a tall boy) An A D J E C T I V E that points to something, e.g. este hombre, esa mujer, aquella casa, aquellas calles (this man, that woman, that house, those streets) A word or group of words that modify a V E R B , A D J E C T I V E ´ or another ADVERB, e.g. Puedo hacerlo facilmente (I can do it easily), Este pan es muy bueno (This bread is very good) The person or thing performing the action indicated by the V E R B , e.g. El gato atac´o al perro (The cat attacked the dog). Here the agent is the cat, as in the following example: El perro fue atacado por el gato (The dog was attacked by the cat) There are three kinds of A G R E E M E N T in Spanish. 1. A G R E E M E N T in number. A D J E C T I V E S , V E R B S and A R T I C L E S agree with the N O U N S and P R O N O U N S they relate to, e.g. La chica lista hace sus deberes. 2. Gender A G R E E M E N T . A D J E C T I V E S agree with the NOUN they qualify, e.g. un chico alto, una chica guapa 3. A G R E E M E N T of T E N S E . A correspondence of T E N S E S is often, but not always, required in Spanish, e.g. Yo quer´ıa que mi hermano me ayudara (I wanted my brother to help me), Le he dicho que ir´e (I have told him/her that I will go), Le dije que ir´ıa (I told her/him I would go) (see “G U I D A N C E O N V E R B S ”) A word or P H R A S E to which a P R O N O U N refers. The word or P H R A S E always precedes the P R O N O U N , e.g. The boy who lives down the road is a genius. Boy is the A N T E C E D E N T of who. When the A N T E C E D E N T is unclear or indeterminate, the following V E R B is very often in the S U B J U N C T I V E M O O D xi\n\nGlossary of grammatical terms\n\nAPOCOPATION\n\nAPPOSITION\n\nA R T I C L E, D E F I N I T E\n\nA R T I C L E, I N D E F I N I T E\n\nAUGMENTATIVE\n\nCLAUSE\n\nShortening of some A D J E C T I V E S when they immediately precede a N O U N , e.g. un buen (from bueno) caf´e (good coffee), un mal (from malo) vino (bad wine) Two words placed side by side, so that the second word modifies the first, e.g. Madrid, capital de Espa˜na. It may be said that capital is in A P P O S I T I O N to Madrid Word which, when placed in front of a N O U N , determines it by giving it G E N D E R and N U M B E R , e.g. el padre, la madre, los padres, las madres.

The English equivalent is a and some Letters added to the end of a word to indicate an increase in size, or an unpleasant or frightening appearance, e.g. casona (large, stately house), picacho (large, towering peak), casucha (ugly, unpleasant house, hovel) Words forming part of a sentence, containing a FINITE VERB\n\nC L A U S E, M A I N C L A U S E, S U B O RD I N AT E\n\nCOMPARISON\n\nCOMPLEMENT\n\nCONJUGATION\n\nxii\n\nA C L A U S E that can stand alone as a sentence, e.g. Baj´e las escaleras (I went down the stairs) A C L A U S E in a sentence that depends on a M A I N C L A U S E to make sense, e.g. Fui al mercado antes de que llegara mi hermano (I went to the market before my brother arrived). Fui al mercado is the M A I N C L A U S E while antes de que llegara mi hermano is the S U B O R D I N A T E C L A U S E Applies to A D J E C T I V E S and A D V E R B S that are modified to convey greater or lesser intensity, e.g. ´ listo (better, worse, mejor, peor, menos/mas less/more intelligent) Word, P H R A S E , or C L A U S E that completes the meaning of a sentence: a genius is the complement of She is a genius. He would be early is the complement of I hoped he would be early Model followed by V E R B forms. There are three regular C O N J U G A T I O N S in Spanish: hablar, comer, vivir. Unfortunately, for us foreigners, there are numerous I R R E G U L A R V E R B S which include RADICAL/STEM CHANGING VERBS.

This produces a pronunciation of two S Y L L A B L E S of two distinct V O W E L sounds where normally you have a ¨ na ˜ D I P H T H O N G , e.g. cigue Letters added to the end of a word to indicate the meaning of “small.” It often conveys an affectionate tone. The Mexicans are fond of D I M I N U T I V E S , even more than the Spaniards, e.g. golpecito (tap, small blow), mesilla (small, bed-side table) A V O W E L sound, occupying a single S Y L L A B L E , and containing up to two V O W E L S , e.g. aire, caigo What distinguishes N O U N S as well as P R O N O U N S . All N O U N S and P R O N O U N S have a G E N D E R , not just male and female human beings and animals, e.g. el chico (the boy), la chica (the girl), el sol (the sun), la luna (the moon), lo/le veo (I see him), la veo (I see her). A G R E E M E N T must be made between the N O U N and A D J E C T I V E or P A S T P A R T I C I P L E , except when used to form the P E R F E C T T E N S E S , with haber) Words that express an exclamation and denote any strong emotion, e.g. ¡Dios m´ıo!, ¡H´ıjole!

Este es bueno, aqu´ella es mala (This one is good, that one is bad). The written A C C E N T is not necessary but careful writers prefer it P R O N O U N involving a Q U E S T I O N , e.g. ¿Qui´en ha ganado el premio? (Who has won the prize?). Other I N T E R R O G A T I V E ´ (which?), ¿qu´e? P R O N O U N S are ¿cual? ´ (what?), ¿cuyo? (whose?), ¿cuanto? (how much?) A word that replaces a N O U N .

Q U E S T I O N included in a S U B O R D I N A T E C L A U S E , ´ e.g. Me pregunt´o adonde iba (She asked me where I was going) Pronunciation of the Spanish z and c before e/i as if they were an s as in soft. The c is pronounced as the th in thick is pronounced, but only by a relatively small number of people, in central and northern Spain. The whole of Spanish America and Andaluc´ıa are characterized by the SESEO\n\nSINGULAR/PLURAL\n\nA SINGULAR\n\nrefers to one object while a refers to more than one, e.g. el a´ rbol / los a´ rboles (the tree / the trees) Root form of a word, e.g. compr is the stem of the V E R B comprar or the N O U N S compra and comprador The S Y L L A B L E of a word spoken most loudly or most forcibly. S T R E S S is crucial to meaning in both Spanish and English. Compare hablo (I speak) with hablo´ (he spoke), and both invalids in The invalid had an invalid ticket. Not to be confused with A C C E N T S Y L L A B L E or S Y L L A B L E S attached to the end of a word.

Ir is sometimes used in this way, e.g. Va amaneciendo (It’s starting to get light), El camino iba bajando (The path kept going down) The form of a V E R B which is not the I N F I N I T I V E , e.g. corre/corriendo (he runs/running), leo/leyendo (I read/reading), hablamos/hablando (we speak/ speaking) T E N S E that refers to a future event that will have happened before a given moment, e.g. Habremos llegado antes de que salga (We will have arrived before she leaves) T E N S E referring to the future, e.g. Ir´ e (I’ll go) Spanish V E R B form ending in -ando, -iendo, -yendo, like -ing in English, e.g. andando (walking), corriendo (running), yendo (going), leyendo (reading) Present T E N S E used to invest a description or narration with a greater vividness: Yo caminaba tranquilamente en el bosque, y ¡f´ıjate! veo a mi gran amigo que me dice que . . .

Ir (to go) and venir (to come) are I N T R A N S I T I V E V E R B S . See T R A N S I T I V E A V E R B that does not conform to a pattern. Very troublesome for foreign learners and Spanish-speaking children. Ir and ser are such V E R B S . Interestingly and understandably enough, small Spanish children try to “regularize” I R R E G U L A R V E R B S , as often happens in English. No examples given here! Part of a V E R B which makes a clear statement, e.g. Esta´ listo (He’s ready), Me gusta el chocolate (I like chocolate) Part of a V E R B which indicates emotion, pleasure, fear, uncertainty, doubt. It is usually used in a S U B O R D I N A T E C L A U S E , but not always. Has nearly disappeared in English (e.g., It is possible he be right), but very common in all T E N S E S in Spanish and Italian, becoming less common in French where the imperfect S U B J U N C T I V E is very infrequent. E.g. Es posible que tenga raz´on (It’s possible she is/be right), Era imposible que tuviera raz´on (It was impossible that she was right) T E N S E made up of the P R E T E R I T of haber and a P A S T P A R T I C I P L E , e.g. Cuando hubo llegado, fuimos juntos al . . . (When she had arrived, we went . . . together). This T E N S E is only used in elevated language, novels, etc. The T E N S E in common discourse is the P L U P E R F E C T Part of the V E R B which, in conjunction with the V E R B haber, makes up the P E R F E C T T E N S E , e.g. he andado/hablado (I have walked/spoken) C O M P O U N D T E N S E made up of haber and P A S T P A R T I C I P L E , e.g. He visto (I have seen). Much less used in Spanish America, where it is replaced by the P R E T E R I T . See “Verbs,” Unit 5 T E N S E formed by I M P E R F E C T of haber (hab´ıa) and the P A S T P A R T I C I P L E , e.g. cuando hab´ıamos hablado (when we had spoken) Name given to the part of the V E R B ending in -ing in English and in -ando and -iendo in Spanish, e.g. hablando (speaking), comiendo (eating) Simple past T E N S E .

British English spelling P R E T E R I T E A V E R B that is conjugated in all its forms with the P R O N O U N S me, te, se, nos, os. This means that the subject and the reflexive P R O N O U N are the same person, e.g. Yo me veo en el espejo (I see myself in the mirror), Me rasuro (M ) / me afeito con la m´aquina (I shave with the electric razor) A V E R B that is R E G U L A R in its endings but does not fit an obvious pattern so that Spaniards call them I R R E G U L A R . These verbs are “irregular” because the stressed V O W E L changes in certain parts of the V E R B , e.g. querer – quiero, quieres, quiere, queremos, quer´eis, quieren / contar – cuento, cuentas, cuenta, contamos, cont´ais, cuentan. Can cause difficulty, especially in the imperfect S U B J U N C T I V E . It could be legitimately argued that these V E R B S are not I R R E G U L A R since they do conform to a specific pattern. The English description R A D I C A L / S T E M C H A N G I N G is much more helpful than I R R E G U L A R . See “Irregular verbs,” Unit 12 A V E R B conveying an action done by a person or thing to himself/itself, e.g. Me lavo (I wash (myself)), El sol se esconde detr´as de las nubes (The sun hides behind the clouds). The English does not have a R E F L E X I V E form in the second case but it is necessary in Spanish. Otherwise, you would be wondering what the sun was hiding. There are many V E R B S that behave both non-reflexively and reflexively in Spanish A V E R B that conforms to a pattern. Very reassuring for foreign learners, and Spanish-speaking children. Hablar, comer and vivir are R E G U L A R V E R B S . Part of the V E R B which indicates the moment when an action or thought takes place, e.g. nado is the present T E N S E of the V E R B nadar. Nadaba is the I M P E R F E C T T E N S E of the V E R B nadar A V E R B that takes a direct object, e.g. Veo la puerta (I see the door). See I N T R A N S I T I V E The A C T I V E V O I C E relates to the subject of the sentence performing the action. The sentence The boy broke the window is in the A C T I V E V O I C E , whereas The window was broken by the boy is in the P A S S I V E V O I C E . A V E R B in the A C T I V E V O I C E can be T R A N S I T I V E or I N T R A N S I T I V E but a V E R B in the P A S S I V E V O I C E can only be TRANSITIVE\n\nxviii\n\nNote on the text\n\nMost translations of either whole sentences, phrases or individual words are given when it is felt that they are necessary for an accurate understanding of the grammar under consideration.

The Grammar (see bibliography) and Dictionary (Diccionario de la Lengua Espanola, ˜ 2 vols., 22nd edn., Madrid: Espasa Calpe) published by it are the standards of the language, but this only applies to Spain. It can no longer legislate for the Spanish of the Americas which has a lexical richness and diversity which can be initially confusing and certainly challenging. But fear not, for compensation is at hand, the grammar of the various countries concerned is comfortingly uniform and we must be grateful for this – and this includes the author. We must also be grateful to the Real Academia for helping to keep the language relatively stable.\n\nLevel 1 ´ 1.1 Alphabet, spelling and pronunciation (Alfabeto, ortograf´ıa y pronunciacion) ´ 1.2 Stress (El acento tonico)\n\n1.1 Alphabet, spelling and pronunciation As with the grammar, Spanish pronunciation is happily uniform, with the consequence that once you have conquered the sounds, you are not enmeshed in the mire associated with, for example, the innumerable and irreducible irregularities of English pronunciation. Furthermore, the spelling system of the Spanish language is really quite easy compared to English. Aim for a perfect accent and real fluency. This will not only help you immeasurably in your communication with Spanish speakers but also allow you to appreciate more the written word, especially literature which is its highest expression.

In all Spanish America and much of southern Spain, the c before i and e sounds like the English ss. The Iberian z sounds like the English th as in thick but in all Spanish America and much of Southern Spain it sounds like the English ss The x in M´exico is pronounced as a jota The n with the tilde is nearly always referred to as la e˜ne Great importance is attached to the vowels in Spanish. Their sounds are full and clear, while those of the consonants can be obscure and even be suppressed.\n\n1.2 Stress In Spanish, as in English, in words of two or more syllables, one is pronounced more forcibly than the others. This forcible utterance is called stress. In writing, it appears thus: a´ , ´e, ´ı, o´, u´ . As it would be laborious, unnecessary and even confusing to place an accent-mark over every written word, words are grouped into classes. Words coming into these classes do not need the written accent, and only the exceptions require it. Here are some of the basic rules governing the use of stress and the written accent. The rest will appear in level 2. i The greater part of words ending in a vowel are stressed (but not in writing) on the penultimate (next to last) syllable: pero (but), perro (dog), lleva (he/she takes), carro (M)/coche (car), casa (house), bomba (bomb/pump), libro (book) ii The greater part of words ending in n or s are stressed (but not in writing) on the penultimate: toman (they take, you take), margen (margin/edge), imagen (image/picture), volumen, martes (Tuesday), crisis iii The greater part of words ending in other consonants than n or s (including all infinitives) are stressed (but not in writing) on the last syllable: esperar (to hope / wait for), decir (to say), alfiler (pin), peral (pear tree), perejil (parsley, and extraordinarily the name of a rock, a Spanish possession a few hundred yards off the Moroccan coast), altivez (haughtiness), majestad (majesty), magnitud iv All exceptions to these rules require a written accent over the accented syllable: caf´e (coffee/caf´e), ped´ıs (you ask), rev´es (setback), encontr´o (she/he met/found), c´esped (lawn), m´armol (marble), a´ ngel, dif´ıcil (difficult), f´acil (easy) v All words stressed on a syllable previous to the penultimate require an accent mark: m´usico (musician), h´eroe (hero), r´egimen (regime), l´ınea (line), d´abamos (we used to give), crep´usculo (twilight), atm´osfera, gram´atica (grammar) vi There is a clear choice on two words: oceano/oc´eano, periodo/per´ıodo Exercises Level 1 i Pronunciation drill (ejercicio de pronunciacion) ´\n\nRead aloud all the letters of the following sentences which are very common proverbs or expressions. It is best if you can find a Spanish speaker or a teacher of Spanish to 2\n\n1 Alphabet, spelling and pronunciation\n\nhelp you with these sounds, at least initially. The proverbs are uncomplicated so you can easily work out their meaning and find a proper English equivalent from the rough translation: Empezar la casa por el tejado – To begin (building) the house with the roof Quien mala cama hace, en ella yace – He who makes a bad bed lies on it Poderoso caballero es Don Dinero – Powerful gentleman is Mr. Cash M´as vale p´ajaro en mano que cien volando – Better a bird in your hand than a hundred flying nadar como un pez – to swim like a fish dormir como un tronco – to sleep like a log ii Put in, where necessary, all the accents in the following passage. Also answer the questions on the passage:\n\nViajando a traves de la ciudad de Mexico La ciudad de Mexico es una de las mas grandes del mundo, y como en toda gran ciudad, el transporte es muy diverso, y ofrece muchas opciones para viajar de un lugar a otro. Se puede viajar en automovil, taxi, colectivo, camion, bicicleta, y trolebus. La mayoria de la poblacion hace uso del transporte publico. Los vehiculos mas utilizados de manera privada son los automoviles y los taxis.\n\na Is there a written accent if you put opciones in the singular? b Is there a written accent on ciudad if you put it in the plural? c Is there a written accent on lugar (correctly spelt here?), camion (correctly spelt here?), trolebus (correctly spelt here?) and poblacion (correctly spelt here?) if you put them in the plural?

If both vowels are weak (i and u), the stress falls on the last of the two, as: ruido (noise), viuda (widow) ii The gradual scale of the sonority or strength of the vowels is as follows: a, o, e, i, u, A, o, e are called strong vowels, while i and u are weak vowels 3\n\nA STUDENT GRAMMAR OF SPANISH\n\niii Diphthongs cannot be formed from the strong vowels alone, but are a combination of a strong and weak vowel, or of i and u combined. When two strong vowels combine, each is considered as a separate vowel: real (real/royal), a´ereo, h´eroe, oasis iv Triphthongs are composed of one strong vowel between two weak ones v In brief, a Spanish diphthong consists of a vowel preceded or followed by either i or u. In a triphthong, one of the latter two is on each side of the strong vowel vi Examples of diphthongs – ia: Asia, Santiago; ai: aire, caigo (I fall), fraile (monk); ie: miente ((s)he lies), piedra (stone), tiempo; ei: reina (queen), veinte, pleito (lawsuit), treinta; io: maniobra (maneuver), patriota, piocha (pickax), violento; oi: oigo (I hear), boina (beret); ua: cuanto, guante (glove), fragua (forge); au: pausa, cautela (prudence); ue: fuego (fire), puente (bridge), muestra (sample); eu: feudo (fiefdom), Europa, neutro; uo: cuota (quota), continuo; iu: triunfo (triumph), oriundo (originating); ui: buitre (vulture), ruido (noise), fuiste (you were/went), Luisa vii Examples of triphthongs – iai: cambi´ais (you change), vari´ais (you vary); iei: apreci´eis (that you should appreciate), irradi´eis (that you should radiate), contagi´eis (that you should infect); uai: mengu´ais (you diminish), averigu´ais (you check out); uei: amortig¨u´eis (that you should deaden), santig¨u´eis (that you should bless) viii Since a diphthong or triphthong is, in pronunciation, treated as a single syllable, it requires a written accent as with a single vowel. ix In diphthongs containing a strong vowel, and in triphthongs, the accent mark belongs over the strong vowel; when placed over the weak one, the diphthong or triphthong disappears to become two syllables. Thus in causa and C´aucasa, au is a diphthong, but not in sa´uco (willow tree); iai in vari´ais is a triphthong but not in tem´ıais. As we shall see later, in Spanish America, e.g. Mexico, triphthongs hardly exist, since the second person plural (vosotros/os/vosotras/as) is replaced by Uds. A lot easier, and certainly for Mexicans who find triphthongs quaint, rebarbative or just plain difficult to pronounce, with the result that the present author can become a figure of fun. x If a syllable requiring a written accent contains a diphthong or a triphthong, the accent must be placed over the strong vowel; hu´esped (guest), despu´es, estudi´ais, o´iganos (listen to us). In the case of a diphthong, if both vowels are weak, the spoken accent falls on the second vowel. No written accent occurs here: circuito, ruido, he huido (I have fled). xi Whenever the weak vowel of a triphthong or diphthong is stressed, or the first vowel when both are weak, the written accent is placed over the said vowel, to show that there is no diphthong or triphthong: ata´ud (casket, coffin), pa´ıs (country), incre´ıble, ra´ız (root), poes´ıa, d´ıa, le´ıa ((s)he was reading), ba´ul (trunk), para´ıso (paradise) xii A mute h between two vowels does not prevent a diphthong. The written accent is accordingly placed: barah´unda (ruckus, bedlam), ah´ınco (earnestness), ah´ıto (full, stuffed), b´uho (owl), proh´ıben (they forbid), reh´uso (I refuse), retah´ıla (string, series), vah´ıdo (dizzy spell)\n\n2.2 Consonants i F, k, l, m, n and p have at all times the same value in Spanish as in English: fama, kilo, comer, madre, entre, padre 4\n\n1 Alphabet, spelling and pronunciation\n\nii B and v have the same sound as in English, depending on where they are in the word. When they are in an initial position, the b of burro is the same as the b of but, and the same goes for the v in vaca. However, when b and v are within a word and especially between two vowels, the lips are pressed lightly together, creating a kind of lisp: haber, saber, lavar, cavar (to dig) iii C has two sounds. Before e and i, it is pronounced like th in thin: centro, encima, cielo. In all other cases, it has the sound of k: encanto (charm), cura (priest), cruz (cross), esclavo (slave) iv However, in nearly all southern Spain and the whole of Spanish America, the pronunciation of c before e and i, as with z in all cases, is that of c as in city or center: Centro = sentro, encima = ensima, cielo = sielo, caza = casa (room for confusion here!), zapato = sapato, durazno = durasno (M). For Spanish American speakers of Spanish, the th sound of c and z is generally regarded as pedantic, affected and even archaic, harking back to colonial times v Ch is pronounced like ch in church: muchacha, chica, chava (M) (girl), ch´evere (M) (fantastic) vi D never has the decided English sound of d, but has a tinge of the sound of th in then: ciudad, dar, desde, doler, hablado, pegado. In many parts of Spain, when d occurs between two vowels, and especially in past participles of the -ado type, the d can disappear completely in the spoken language. Thus, hablado (spoken) ends up as hablao, pasmado (amazed) as pasmao, pegado (hit) as pegao. The practice is frowned upon by purists, and is not characteristic of Spanish America where, as we shall see in the section on verbs, the perfect tense he hablado (I have spoken) is largely replaced by the preterite habl´e (I spoke). Mexicans, for instance, find it odd and even illiterate. vii G has two sounds. Before e and i, it has the sound of a strongly aspirated h. In all other cases it sounds like g in go: gesti´on (procedure), gente, giro (turn), gimnasio, garage (M) (second g as in American English), gusto (pleasure) viii In order to obtain the hard g of gusto before e and i, a u is inserted. In this case, the u is silent: guiar (to guide), guisar (to cook), enseguida, pegue (that he hits), agregue (that she should add). But if the u is retained as an independent sound, a diaresis is placed over it (i.e. u¨ ) – ling¨uista, ag¨uero (omen), desag¨ue (drain, wastepipe) – but here it has a swallowed sound as in agua ix H has a slight trace of aspiration before ue: hueco (hollow), huevo (egg) x J has in all cases the same sound as g has before e and i: juicio (judgment), jerga (slang), jugar (play), enjambre (swarm) xi Ll had until recently the sound of the letters lli as in the English million. But such a sound is considered pedantic by most Spanish speakers, and this includes all Spanish America, so that we end up with a double y, rather like the y in your but slightly elongated: gallego (Galician [in northern Spain]), llamar, llorar, lluvia, pollo xii N presents no problem for an English speaker xiii N˜ has the sound of the letters ni, as in pinion: ni˜no, se˜nor, oto˜no xiv Q occurs only before ue and ui, and sounds like k, the following u being always silent: tanque (M = gas tank in car), quebrar (to break), parroquia (parish) xv R has a roll, and a more marked roll (like a double rr) at the beginning of words: regla, parar, mirar, enredar (to confuse), cortar. If you have a Scottish accent, you will have no problem at all. When an initial r is preceded by an s, as in los rayos (rays) / 5\n\nA STUDENT GRAMMAR OF SPANISH\n\nxvi xvii xviii xix xx\n\nxxi\n\nlos rollos (rolls), the s often disappears so that we end up with lo- rayos/rollos, and this is not only restricted to the untutored classes S sounds like ss as in hiss. No real problem here, except for the immediately preceding comment T is softer than the English t, and is pronounced with the tongue touching the palate more gently: tratar (to treat), pato (duck), total V. See b W. An import found in, for example, W´agner = V´agner, W´ashington = V´ashington X requires considerable comment, notably for Mexico. In Spain, the sound is of x as in axle; exacto, exigir (to demand). However, when it precedes a c it frequently ends up as an s: excelente = escelente, exceso = esceso. Condemned by purists, it is in general practice, although formal speech would require excelente. In Mexico, the x has three pronunciations. The first is as in Spain, i.e. between two vowels: taxi, m´aximo, laxitud. The second is like a jota, as in M´exico, Oaxaca (city and state). The jota sound of the x overflows onto words like xenofobia. There is confusion whether the x of this word should be pronounced as an English x or a jota. One for the quiz program. Informed opinion is that this initial x should be pronounced as the English x. The third pronunciation is like an s. This pronunciation occurs not infrequently, especially with names of Aztec origin. Thus we have: Xochitl, Xochimilco (district in the south of Mexico City). Finally, the x of words like excelente and explicar, preceding a consonant, is like the English x, and not like an s, as in Spain. Y has the same value as in English and, for z, see point iv above\n\n2.3 Elision in speech i When a vowel at the end of one word immediately precedes a vowel at the beginning of the next word, the two vowels run together in speech. A mute h does not change this feature: si es as´ı, cuesta un peso, otro a˜no, su hacienda/hilo ii This also applies to three words: Fue a Europa, sali´o a Espa˜na iii When the two vowels are the same, one is always lost in rapid speech: la ayuda = l’ayuda, para agradecerle = par’agradecerle. Note the very common, colloquial Mexican expression for many: hasta pa’aventar pa’arriba (hasta para aventar para arriba)\n\n2.4 Rules governing the use of written accents When one or more pronouns are added to any part of a verb so as to shift the accented syllable to the antepenultimate (two before the last one), or still farther from the end, the accent is marked: para com´ermelo (for me to eat it all up), para consegu´ırtelo (to get it for you), d´andoselos (giving them to her/him/them, you). When two Spanish words are combined, each retains its original accent, whether written or not. This is especially common with adverbs: cort´esmente (written accent on the first e and stress on the first two e’s), naturalmente (stress on second a and first e of mente), correctamente (stress on the first two e’s), ferrocarril (stress on e and i ). Where there are two monosyllables of identical form, the more emphatic one is distinguished by a written accent: 6\n\n1 Alphabet, spelling and pronunciation\n\nd´e, give (subjunctive of dar) ´el, he, him m´ı, me m´as, more s´e, I know, be (imperative of ser) s´ı, yes, one’s self\n\nde, of, from el, the mi, my mas, but se, one’s self si, if\n\nt´e, tea t´u, you ¡v´e!, go! (imperative of ir)\n\nte, you tu, your ve, sees (present of ver)\n\n´ (still), and solo (alone), s´olo (only) Note also: aun (even), aun Examples Aun los m´as torpes lo entienden = Even the dumbest understand it A´un no ha venido tu pap´a = Your father still hasn’t come Est´a solo/a = (S)he’s alone Tiene s´olo cinco a˜nos = She’s only five To distinguish between the interrogative or exclamatory and the relative use of pronouns and adverbs, a written accent is placed on the first two. Frequently, Spanish speakers, even very literate ones, fail to observe this rule, so you could be in good company if you fail here too: ¿c´omo? ¿cu´ando? ¿d´onde? ¿qui´en?\n\nhow? when? where? who? whom?\n\nExamples ¿C´omo puede hacerlo? ¿Cu´ando vienes? ¿D´onde est´a el chico? ¿Qui´en lo ha hecho? ¿Cu´al de los dos viene? ¿Cu´anto cuesta? ¿Qu´e has dicho/dijiste?\n\ncomo cuando donde quien\n\nas, if when where who, whom\n\n¿cu´al? which? ¿cu´anto? how much? ¿qu´e? what?\n\ncual which cuanto as much que which, that\n\nComo no puede hacerlo ahora, ser´a mejor esta tarde Viene cuando puede S´e donde est´a Yo s´e quien lo ha hecho Yo s´e cual de los dos viene Te doy todo cuanto quieras Me dice que regresa ma˜nana\n\nA problem can arise, even for Spanish speakers, when the question is indirect, or a question is implied, as in: Le pregunt´e cu´ando volver´ıa = I asked her/him when (s)he would come back ¿Por qu´e me preguntas d´onde est´a la chava (M)? Why do you ask me where the girl is? Notice also the upside-down question mark at the beginning of the sentence. The same happens with an exclamation mark/point: ¡H´ıjole! (M), ¡Jol´ın! (both = “Jeez! Heavens above!”)\n\n2.5 Spelling traps Here are just a few Spanish words that have a near, and therefore misleading, spelling equivalent in English. There are many more. This small list serves to point out that you should be wary of skating over words without paying detailed attention to them: 7\n\nA STUDENT GRAMMAR OF SPANISH\n\n´ atormentar, cacao, centinela (sentry), complice (accomplice), conmemorar, dignatario (dignitary), ejemplo, e´ xtasis, femenismo, feminino, fisonom´ıa, hipocres´ıa, independiente, inmediato, inmigrante, inmunitario, inventorio, literario, literatura, profec´ıa, quimioterapia, radiactividad, responsabilidad, sicomoro, tarifa, tenis, vainilla\n\n2.6 Orthographical changes with y and o For the sake of avoiding the concurrence of two like sounds, y (and) is changed to e when the following word begins with i or hi. This also happens with o (or) which becomes u before initial o or ho. Examples espa˜nol e ingl´es padre e hijo Mar´ıa e Isabel plata u oro vida u honor siete u ocho\n\nSpanish and English father and son Mary and Elizabeth/Isabel silver or gold life or honor seven or eight\n\nHowever, when a diphthong is involved, y does not change. Examples madera y hierro ´el y yo lim´on y hielo\n\nwood and iron he and I/me lemon and ice\n\nNote: There are almost no double consonants, except ll and rr.

In this unit we shall deal with gender. There are no available rules for determining the masculine and feminine genders of Spanish nouns. The gender of most Spanish nouns have, unfortunately, to be learnt, just as learners of English have to learn how to spell individual words. It is true that there is usually a reason for the gender assigned, but the origin is frequently obscure or untraceable. Nevertheless, there are some general considerations of great help to the learner. What is certain is that retaining the gender of nouns will help to prevent cerebral decay. i First we must look at how the definite and indefinite article are used before the noun:\n\nDefinite article Indefinite article\n\nMasculine\n\nFeminine\n\nel the un a/an\n\nla the una a/an\n\nThese articles are always placed before the noun: el hombre un hombre\n\n10\n\nthe man a man\n\nla mujer una mujer\n\nthe woman a woman\n\n2 Definite/indefinite articles and noun gender\n\nii Feminine nouns beginning with a stressed a or ha are preceded by el and not la:\n\nel agua the water el hambre the hunger\n\nel hacha the ax el alma the soul\n\nel (h)arpa the harp el ama de la casa\n\nel asma asthma housewife\n\nOther feminine nouns preceded by el: el alza el ancla el aula el haba\n\nrise, increase anchor lecture room bean\n\nel habla el hada el haya\n\nspeech fairy beech tree\n\nBut remember that if the article precedes an unstressed (h)a, la is used: la ambici´on, la alhaja – the jewel, la Alhambra/hamaca – hammock The change does not occur before adjectives of like form: la alta torre – the tall tower, la alta estimaci´on – the high esteem iii When the masculine singular form of the definite article, el, comes immediately after the prepositions a or de, there is a contraction: al, del\n\nal ni˜no/al profesor / al bosque del chico / del hombre / del coche\n\nto the child / teacher / wood of the boy / man / car\n\niv If the noun is feminine, a la / de la are used, as you would expect:\n\na la / de la casa a la mesa / de la mesa\n\nto / of the house to / of the table\n\nFrom now on, the for el and la will not be used in the lists.\n\n1.2 General features of gender – masculine nouns i Names and designations of males, and the males of large and well-known animals, are masculine, irrespective of endings:\n\nel caballo el cardenal el centinela el cura\n\nhorse cardinal sentry priest\n\nel le´on el pr´ıncipe el monarca el tigre\n\nlion prince monarch tiger\n\nii Gender associated with noun ending – in most cases, nouns ending in o are masculine:\n\nel barco el caso el cigarro el hombro\n\nboat case, example cigar(ette) (i.e. both) shoulder\n\nel libro el ojo el palo\n\nbook eye stick\n\nla moto la radio\n\nmotorcycle radio\n\nExceptions are: la d´ınamo la foto la mano\n\ndynamo photo hand\n\n11\n\nA STUDENT GRAMMAR OF SPANISH\n\nFoto and moto are shortened forms of fotograf´ıa and motocicleta while radio is masculine in Mexico. Radio meaning “radius” is masculine in Spain and Mexico. iii Some masculine nouns ending in o do not change their ending when denoting females:\n\nla miembro la modelo\n\nmember model\n\nla soprano la testigo\n\nsoprano witness\n\niv Nouns ending in or are mainly masculine:\n\nel amor el autor el calor\n\nlove author heat\n\nel color el conductor el valor\n\ncolor driver courage, valor\n\nException: la labor work When a feminine noun is implied or understood: la Gestapo, la UNESCO. v Nouns ending in aje:\n\nel andamiaje el equipaje\n\nscaffolding baggage\n\nel paisaje el viaje\n\nlandscape journey\n\nvi Nouns ending in men:\n\nel certamen el r´egimen\n\ncontest r´egime\n\nel volumen\n\nvolume\n\nvii Nouns ending in gen:\n\nel origen but imagen is feminine viii The proper names of countries or territories are masculine, except when they end in unstressed a.\n\n(el) Brasil, (el) Canad´a, (el) Chile, (los) Estados Unidos (United States), (el) Jap´on, (el) M´exico, (los) Pa´ıses Bajos (Netherlands), (el) Panam´a, (el) Per´u The following countries are therefore feminine. Argentina, Australia, Bolivia, China, Colombia, Espa˜na, Francia, Grecia, Guatemala, Holanda, India, Italia, Nueva Zelanda, Rusia, Venezuela ix The following types of noun are all masculine.\n\nRivers\n\nSeas/Oceans Months Mountains\n\n12\n\nel Amazonas (Amazon), el R´ıo Bravo (M) (Rio Grande) but el R´ıo Grande in Spain, el Paran´a, el Sena (Seine), el T´amesis (Thames), el Colorado, el Nilo, el Rin (Rhine) El Atl´antico / el Pac´ıfico / el Mediterr´aneo enero (January), mayo El Himalaya, el Acongagua, los Andes, el Popocatepetl, los Alpes; and volcanos: el\n\n2 Definite/indefinite articles and noun gender\n\nCars Watches Ships and aircraft carriers Airplanes Languages Metals Many trees\n\nVesubio (Vesuvius) (but las (Monta˜nas) Rocosas = Rockies) el Chrysler, el Ford, el Toyota, el Mercedes, el Porsche, el Maserati el Seiko, el Longines el Reina Mary, el Nimitz, el Enterprise el Boeing, el Concorde el espa˜nol, el franc´es, el ingl´es brit´anico / americano, el ruso, el chino el hierro (iron), el cobre (copper), el acero (steel), el bronce (bronze) el olmo (elm), el roble (oak), el fresno (ash), el a´ lamo (poplar) but el (i.e. feminine) haya (beech), la encina (holm oak), la higuera (fig tree)\n\n1.3 Feminine nouns i The designations of females are feminine:\n\nla dama la gallina la muchacha\n\nlady hen girl\n\nla princesa la reina la vaca\n\nprincess queen cow\n\nla puerta la ventana\n\ndoor window\n\nel guardia el jesuita\n\nguard jesuit\n\nii Most nouns ending in a are feminine:\n\nla casa la caza la comida\n\nhouse hunting meal, food\n\nExceptions – nouns denoting males: el artista el cura\n\nartist priest\n\nNote also that centinela is a masculine noun = sentry iii The majority of nouns ending in o change it to a to form the feminine:\n\nel alumno / la alumna el amigo / la amiga el cocinero / la cocinera el conocido / la conocida el criado / la criada el hu´erfano / la hu´erfana el muchacho / la muchacha\n\npupil friend cook acquaintance male / female servant orphan boy / girl\n\n´ iv Nouns ending in: –ma, -dad (many of these), -tad (just a few of these), -tud, -ion (many of these), -umbre, -ie and -sis are feminine:\n\n13\n\nA STUDENT GRAMMAR OF SPANISH\n\n-ma (el) asma la cama la crema (M) la estratagema la forma\n\nasthma bed cream stratagem form\n\nla gema la lima la trama la yema\n\nagility anxiety sickness, illness eternity\n\nla severidad la sociedad la verdad\n\ngem file plot yolk, fingertip\n\n-dad la agilidad la ansiedad la enfermedad la eternidad\n\nseverity society truth\n\n-tad la libertad (freedom) -tud la longitud, virtud (virtue) ´ -ion la ambici´on, intuici´on, naci´on, pasi´on, regi´on, sensaci´on -umbre la certidumbre (certainty), costumbre (custom), cumbre (peak), muchedumbre (crowd) -ie intemperie (bad weather), planicie (plain), serie (series) -is crisis, metamorfosis, s´ıntesis, tesis But the following are masculine: el carisma, cisma (schism), clima, cometa (comet), delta, d´ıa (day), emblema, mapa, planeta, problema, tranv´ıa (streetcar / tram). In all these cases, save d´ıa, mapa, and tranv´ıa, the fact that these nouns end in a but are masculine is explained by their Greek origin. Etymology can be fascinating. Note also: pijama which is masculine in Spain and feminine in Mexico. Matters are not improved with this word since it is even spelt differently in Mexico: piyama. The same goes for American and British English (Pajamas [AE] / pyjamas [BE]), so it is difficult to win here. v The following are also masculine:\n\nel avi´on el gorri´on and\n\n14\n\nairplane sparrow\n\nel sarampi´on el cami´on\n\nmeasles truck but commonly bus in M\n\n2 Definite/indefinite articles and noun gender\n\nel an´alisis el apocalipsis el ´enfasis\n\nanalysis apocalypse emphasis\n\nel ´extasis el par´entesis\n\necstasy parenthesis\n\nvi The following types of nouns are feminine:\n\nIslands\n\nLetters of the alphabet Firms\n\nlas Filipinas, las Marianas, las Malvinas, C´orcega (Corsica), Cerde˜na (Sardinia), Sicilia (last three in the Mediterranean). But las Islas de los Gal´apagos (Galapagos Islands) la a, la b, la c, la h (hache), etc. la Ford, la British (Airways), la General Motors\n\nThese are all the rules of any value. Much could be said about remembering the gender of Spanish nouns. However, suffice it to say that the simplest and easiest way to learn the gender is, when you come across a new noun, put the article in front of it every time, and you will learn by association, following the pattern of a Spanish-speaking child.\n\n1.4 Further features of gender i Where the names of animals do not have distinct masculine and feminine forms, macho and hembra (invariable) are used to make the distinction, but the gender does not change:\n\nel rinoceronte / los rinocerontes / la ardilla (squirrel) / las ardillas macho (for all four nouns) el rat´on (mouse) / los ratones / la ardilla / las ardillas hembra (for all four nouns) ii Family relations and titles\n\nWith nouns denoting titles and family relations, a masculine plural in Spanish may correspond to a masculine and feminine pair: Tengo tres hijos los Reyes Cat´olicos los chicos los ni˜nos los duques de Alba los Presidentes los Se˜nores Garc´ıa los novios\n\nI have three children the Catholic Monarchs (Queen Isabel and King Fernando) the boys (and girls) the children / the boys the Duke and Duchess of Alba the President and First Lady Mr. and Mrs. Garcia the engaged couple\n\niii It could sometimes be unclear what certain plurals mean with respect to gender.\n\nNi˜nos, chicos, hijos and reyes are good cases in point. Hijos, for instance, could signify three sons, or two sons and one daughter, or one son and two daughters. Unfortunately, for females, even when the male is in a minority, as in the last case, the plural is still masculine. Clarification comes with, for example: dos hijos y una hija, dos hijas y un hijo. And if this still does not clear up the ambiguity, and you had three sons, you could say tres varones after tres hijos: Tiene tres hijos, o sea (that is) tres varones. 15\n\nA STUDENT GRAMMAR OF SPANISH\n\n1.5 Words of varying gender i\n\narte mar\n\nmargen\n\nWhen masculine singular = individual art: el arte azteca/cl´asico/precolombiano When collective = the Arts: las bellas artes/artes decorativas/pl´asticas Masculine in general: Me gusta nadar en el mar, el Mar Mediterr´aneo Sometimes feminine in formal, poetic style, and frequently in set phrases: Lo/La (M) pas´e la mar de bien (I had a great time), en alta mar (on the high seas), mar gruesa (heavy sea), mar picada (choppy sea), hacerse a la mar (to put to sea) When = river bank it is feminine and usually found in literary texts When masculine = margin (of page/maneuver), edge (of society)\n\nii There are nouns that are both masculine and feminine and with the same meaning:\n\ncasete interrogante armaz´on\n\ncassette question ( frame of a structure)\n\nlinde boundary (usually feminine) marat´on marathon (usually feminine) lente (= lens but los lentes in M = glasses, i.e. for seeing)\n\niii Names of towns\n\nUsually towns are feminine but practice is not always clear, and there is no true guide: en la Roma antigua, Guanajuato es bella, la atractiva Par´ıs On the other hand it is perfectly acceptable to say: todo Chihuahua/Acapulco/Valencia There seems to be no rigid rule on this point. It would even appear that in Mexico towns are usually masculine, even when they end in a, like Chihuahua. iv Soccer teams are referred to as masculine:\n\nEl Puebla, el Guadalajara, el Toluca, el Barcelona (more usually el Bar¸ca), el Real (Madrid) Exercises Level 1 i Find the gender and meaning of the following nouns, and put el/la/un/una before them:\n\ncasa, silla, plato, mesa, foco (M), bombilla, libro, botella, cuaderno, habitaci´on, costa, fuente, reina, amigo, burro, caballo, jard´ın, mapa (careful!), rey, v´ıctima (careful! ), a´ rea, arma ii Put del / de la / al / a la before the following nouns and find their meaning:\n\ncasa, mesa, caballo, habitaci´on, mapa, v´ıctima, a´ rea, arma, a´ rbol, calle, pared, taza, p´ajaro, escuela, departamento (M = apartment), apartamento, a´ ngel, a´ guila, anchoa, alga iii Complete with the correct article indicating gender (choose which is more appropriate between the definite and indefinite article but either will do in some cases):\n\na b c d 16\n\n( ) chica trabaja todo ( ) d´ıa En ( ) suelo hay ( ) gato ( ) padre est´a sentado en ( ) sill´on ¿Ves ( ) reloj en ( ) mesa?\n\n2 Definite/indefinite articles and noun gender\n\ne f g h i j\n\n( ) flor est´a en ( ) jard´ın ( ) mujer est´a en ( ) calle Veo ( ) a´ rbol en ( ) parque ( ) estudiante habla con ( ) profesora / ( ) profesor ( ) p´ajaro canta en ( ) cielo ( ) casa est´a detr´as de ( ) jard´ın\n\niv Paired activity\n\nObjective – Learn the gender of nouns Method – Ask each other, in turn, the gender of a noun. Both participants spend two minutes collecting a list of ten nouns, from level 1. Example The first person asks: ¿Cu´al es el g´enero del nombre “carro?” (What is the gender of the noun carro?) Answer: “Carro” es masculino. The partner asks: ¿Cu´al es el g´enero del nombre “casa?” Answer: “Casa” es femenino. When all ten questions have been asked, the teacher/instructor brings the class together and asks, in simple Spanish, if there are any difficult genders. Level 2 ´ detalles sobre los art´ıculos 2.1 More on the definite and indefinite articles (Mas definidos e indefinidos) ´ 2.2 The neuter gender (El genero neutro) 2.3 Same noun but different meaning according to the gender (El mismo ´ el genero) ´ sustantivo pero otro sentido segun ´ ´ 2.4 Problem genders (Generos problematicos) ´ 2.5 Gender of compound nouns (Genero de nombres compuestos) ´ a/o) 2.6 Words distinguished by the ending a/o (Voces con terminacion 2.7 Misleading similarities (Falsos amigos)\n\n2.1 More on the definite and indefinite articles i A few nouns with endings other than a have a common form for both genders:\n\nel/la c´omplice, el/la criminal, el/la hereje (heretic), joven (young man or girl), m´artir, miembro, reo (accused person / convicted offender), testigo (witness), vocal (committee member) ii Names of some cities are preceded by the definite article:\n\nEl Cairo, El Cabo (Cape Town), La Coru˜na (in Spain), El Cuzco (in Peru), El Ferrol (in Spain), La Habana Hence Voy a El Cabo, a El Cairo, a La Coru˜na, but in speech, in Spain, you frequently hear Voy al Ferrol, and most Mexicans would say Voy a Cuzco. iii The names of several countries have traditionally been preceded by the definite article, especially when the country is masculine, but this usage is fast disappearing. ´ el Chile, el Ecuador, el Japon, ´ el Paraguay, el These include el Brasil, el Canada, ´ Japon, ´ Uruguay, but nearly all Spanish speakers say nowadays Voy a Brasil, Canada, etc. At the same time, there are three countries where the definite article is still used: Los Estados Unidos, El Reino Unido (United Kingdom), La India. It should be\n\n17\n\nA STUDENT GRAMMAR OF SPANISH\n\nadded that when the plural Los precedes Estados Unidos when it is the subject of a verb, the verb is in the plural. When Estados Unidos stands alone, i.e. without Los, as the subject of the sentence, the verb is in the singular: Los Estados Unidos forman un ´ bloque economico muy importante / Estados Unidos se opone a la sugerencia (. . . is opposed to the suggestion). iv The definite article is required if the name of the country is qualified by an adjective or a phrase:\n\nel Asia rusa, el Asia Menor, el M´exico contempor´aneo, la fecunda Italia (fertile Italy), la Argentina de los a˜nos sesenta (( . . . ) of the sixties) v Technically, each noun is preceded by the article but this usage is also slipping away, and not only in speech. When the nouns are closely associated with each other, this is especially true. It also applies to nouns of different gender:\n\nla energ´ıa y celo (m) que muestra El descuido y negligencia (f ) del soldado El inter´es, inteligencia (f ), honradez (f) del empleado\n\nthe energy and zeal he shows the soldier’s carelessness and negligence the clerk’s interest, intelligence and honesty\n\nvi The article is not repeated after o = or, before a noun that is merely a synonym or explanation of the preceding noun:\n\nel vest´ıbulo o entrada de la casa Edimburgo es la capital o ciudad principal de Escocia\n\nthe hall or entrance to the house Edinburgh is the capital or main city of Scotland\n\nvii Both definite and indefinite articles are omitted before a noun in apposition (i.e. when it explains a preceding noun):\n\nVeracruz, principal puerto en la costa oriental de M´exico Quito, capital de Ecuador, posee un clima delicioso Unamuno, autor de la Generaci´on del ’98\n\nVeracruz, main city . . . Quito, Ecuador’s capital, possesses . . . Unamuno, author of . . .\n\nviii The article is used to express any of the elements or features of nature, animals and plants of which only one can be supposed to be under consideration:\n\nEl cielo es azul El sol puede ser peligroso El lirio es una flor vistosa El zorro tiene fama por su astucia La tierra es redonda La cig¨ue˜na es un ave pasajera\n\nThe sky is blue The sun can be dangerous The lily is a bright and colorful flower The fox is well known for its cunning The earth is round The stork is a migratory bird\n\nix The article is used of representatives of a race, or parts or faculties of man, taken in a general sense:\n\nEl paname˜no los estadounidenses/estadunidenses (M) el blanco el negro los chinos los comunistas 18\n\nPanamanian North Americans white person black person (the) Chinese (the) Communists\n\n2 Definite/indefinite articles and noun gender\n\nel h´ıgado el coraz´on la memoria el alma\n\n(the) liver (the) heart (the) memory (the) soul\n\nx It is used of epithets or nicknames following a proper name of a person:\n\nPedro el Cruel Isabel la Cat´olica Alejandro el Grande\n\nPeter the Cruel the Catholic Isabel Alexander the Great (but also Alejandro Magno)\n\nxi A striking difference between Spanish and English is the use of the definite article in Spanish before any noun that is representative of the entire class or species:\n\nEl hombre es mortal El pan es nutritivo Las flores son el adorno de la tierra\n\nMan is mortal Bread is nutritious Flowers are the adornment of the earth\n\nxii The Spanish article is used when nouns represent abstract qualities or ideas:\n\nlos estragos del tiempo El orgullo es un defecto La envidia es un pecado capital El destino del hombre no se puede evitar\n\nthe ravages of time Pride is a defect Envy is a capital sin Man’s destiny cannot be avoided\n\nxiii The article is often used before a verb in the infinitive:\n\nEl hablar tanto es su falta principal El comer y el beber son necesarios a la vida El leer alto es una buena pr´actica El nadar es muy sano\n\nSpeaking so much is his main fault Eating and drinking are necessary to life Reading aloud is a good practice Swimming is very healthy\n\nxiv The article is omitted when reference is made to professions:\n\nEs m´edico/doctor(a)/profesor(a)/ingeniero(a)/enfermero(a), contable = (S)he is a doctor/ teacher/engineer/nurse/accountant But if the noun is qualified the article (usually indefinite) is used: Es una doctora muy h´abil Es una contable muy competente\n\nShe is a very skillful physician/doctor He is a very competent accountant\n\nxv The article is also omitted when a noun and adjective occur so frequently that they become a set expression:\n\nEs buena persona Es buen cat´olico Es gran orador\n\n(S)he is a very nice person He’s a good Catholic He’s a great speaker\n\nxvi In elegant style, the article is frequently omitted in enumerations:\n\nAsistieron al partido hombres, mujeres, ni˜nos, ancianos, y hasta burros Men, women, children, old people and even donkeys went to the match\n\n19\n\nA STUDENT GRAMMAR OF SPANISH\n\nxvii Formation of masculine/feminine pairs:\n\nThe most common masculine/feminine pairs are: -o/-a -e/-a -or/-ora\n\nel t´ıo / la t´ıa el monje / la monja el autor / la autora\n\n(uncle/aunt) (monk/nun) (author)\n\nNote also the following less common distinctive feminine endings: -esa -isa -riz\n\nel abad / la abadesa el profeta / la profetisa el actor / la actriz\n\nabbott/abbess prophet/prophetess actor/actress\n\nNote also nouns ending in -ista, e.g. el/la corista (chorister) / pianista (pianist), violinista (violinist). Note that the feminine form of corista has the meaning of “chorus girl.” xviii However, complications are not far away as illustrated by the two following categories:\n\na When the feminine form already has a distinct meaning: el f´ısico physicist la f´ısica physics el alcalde mayor la alcaldesa mayor’s wife el polic´ıa police officer la polic´ıa police (force) b When there was no feminine form in existence, and few females in the job: ministro (was masculine and feminine) and now ministra for feminine form presidente (was M and F) and now presidenta for feminine form c´onsul (el was used for both genders) but now la c´onsul agente (formerly el for both genders) but now la agente As women take on new roles in Western society, Spanish has, like French and Italian, had to find new feminines, and feminists are doing their best to establish new forms. The feminine form of professional nouns is now used regularly and applies to women in these professions. For example, m´edica signifies “female doctor” and not “doctor’s wife” but m´edico is still by far the preferred term; alcaldesa means “female mayor” and can mean “mayor’s wife”; abogada only means “female lawyer”; polic´ıa is now the accepted term for “policewoman” as well as “policeman” and “police force” (room for dangerous confusion here?); primera ministra has now supplanted primer ministro for a female “prime minister.” This change to a markedly feminine form still does not encourage dictionaries to put an equal number of examples in the feminine, as is the case in the present work, so there is a residual resistance somewhere. The following are now acceptable feminine forms, in addition to those quoted above: a´ rbitra (referee), candidata, clienta, concejala (city / town hall councilor), diputada (member of parliament), edila (member of town hall council), jefa (head of an establishment), reportera, senadora, sirvienta but, even here, concejal and edil can be feminine. There is some limited comfort for females with a feminist tendency in the following: the feminine form modista can mean “male fashion designer” but modisto is in current use. However, strange as it may seem, un desnudo has to be masculine, as in French and Italian. Does this say anything about the Latin psyche? Or does the noun simply refer to the painting or sculpture? Perhaps it is the latter. On the other hand, a male film star has to be feminine: una estrella. 20\n\n2 Definite/indefinite articles and noun gender\n\n2.2 The neuter gender i The neuter form of the article, lo, is not applicable to nouns since all nouns are masculine or feminine. It is used before adjectives, participles, adjectival pronouns and occasionally adverbs. The effect of placing lo before such words is to form a phrase which often has an abstract idea:\n\nlo agradable lo mexicano lo hecho/dicho/mencionado Lo ocurrido me impact´o Hice lo posible / lo necesario Prefiero lo pr´actico a lo decorativo\n\nwhat is pleasant, pleasantness what is Mexican what is/was done/said/mentioned What (had) happened affected me deeply I did what I could / what was necessary I prefer what’s practical to the decorative\n\nii The substantive or “noun” nature of the adjective or participle preceded by lo is very clear when it is followed by de and a noun. This construction is not always easy to put into English:\n\nlo claro de la frase lo extra˜no del asunto lo tonto de sus palabras sin pensar en lo complicado de la tarea Lo m´as dif´ıcil fue entenderlo\n\nthe clarity of the phrase/sentence the curious thing about the business the dumb thing in what he said without thinking about how complicated the job would be The most difficult thing was to understand him\n\n2.3 Same noun but different meaning according to the gender A number of Spanish nouns are both masculine and feminine, but have different meanings which are sometimes related. This phenomenon, common to all Romance languages, really does test our memory. i The feminine noun is collective while the masculine is individual:\n\nbater´ıa\n\ndefensa escolta guardia polic´ıa\n\nF\n\nM\n\nbattery (of guns), (car) battery, footlights, percussion section of orchestra, set of kitchen utensils defense (in most senses) escort (group) guard (group), custody police, policewoman\n\ndrummer (in band)\n\ndefender (in soccer) escort (individual) guard (individual), policeman policeman\n\nii The feminine noun is literal, while the masculine noun is a person or thing associated with a metaphoric function:\n\nbestia cabeza\n\nF\n\nM\n\nbeast, uncouth woman head\n\nuncouth man, brute head of an organization 21\n\nA STUDENT GRAMMAR OF SPANISH\n\ncalavera c´amara caza cura espada facha g´enesis gu´ıa ma˜nana meta pareja recluta vig´ıa\n\nskull camera hunt cure sword appearance, look origin guidebook, female guide morning objective, goal couple (of people), female partner recruitment watchtower\n\nreckless/rakish man cameraman fighter (airplane) priest (Catholic) swordsman, matador fascist (term of abuse) Book of Genesis guide (person) future goalkeeper male partner rookie, recruit watchman\n\nNB Cabeza is always feminine in Mexico, whether referring to a part of the anatomy or to the head of an organization or the family: El padre es la cabeza de la familia = The father is the head of the family iii Others\n\nordenanza panda parte\n\nF capital city (national or provincial) head office, telephone exchange; central nuclear/ hidroel´ectrica = nuclear/ hydroelectric power station anger comma kite flow, current (of water, electricity) (royal) court, Las Cortes = Spanish Parliament publishing house final (match) forehead grudge, ill will ethics, morale order, command, military or religious order as in la Orden de Calatrava decree, ordinance gang part (of something)\n\npendiente\n\nslope (on hill)\n\ncapital central\n\nc´olera coma cometa corriente corte editorial final frente hincha moral orden\n\n22\n\nM capital (i.e. money) center forward, central defender (soccer)\n\ncholera coma comet current month cut (general), outage, power cut lead article end (of street, show, game) front (part) (battle, political front) supporter (in sport) blackberry bush order, arrangement as in orden alfab´etico, civil order as in las fuerzas del orden office boy, orderly (in armed forces) panda report as in parte meteorol´ogico = weather forecast earring\n\n2 Definite/indefinite articles and noun gender\n\npez radio terminal\n\npitch, tar radio (but in M = masculine) bus/airplane terminal (but both are feminine in Mexico) vowel, female committee member\n\nvocal\n\nfish (alive in water) radius, spoke (in wheel), radium (electrical) terminal male committee member\n\n2.4 Problem genders The gender of the following words is especially liable to confusion, particularly if you have studied, or are studying, French and/or Italian. Please have sympathy with the present author. i Words ending in e: M\n\nauge avance cauce declive enchufe fraude peine s´ındrome timbre\n\nboom, highest point advance (river) bed/course slope, incline electrical plug, influence fraud comb syndrome bell, postage stamp (in M)\n\nF\n\nbase cat´astrofe gripe higiene ´ındole mole pir´amide sede\n\nbase catastrophe flu, bad cold hygiene nature, character mass, bulk pyramide see, seat (of government)\n\nii Words ending in al: M\n\ncereal zarzal\n\nF\n\ncereal bramble, thicket\n\ncal central\n\nespiral multinacional postal sal se˜nal sucursal\n\nlime power station, telephone exchange, head office spiral multinational postcard salt sign branch (office)\n\niii Words ending in ante and ente: M\n\nante componente paciente\n\nsuede, elk component patient (but can be feminine)\n\nF\n\nconstante mente patente pendiente simiente\n\nconstant mind patent slope seed 23\n\nA STUDENT GRAMMAR OF SPANISH\n\niv Words ending in z: M\n\naprendiz avestruz c´aliz matiz pez (alive) regaliz\n\nF\n\nfaz hoz lombriz perdiz tez\n\napprentice, learner ostrich chalice hue, shade (of meaning) fish licorice\n\nsurface, face sickle, gorge worm partridge complexion\n\nv A number of feminine words:\n\narmaz´on bilis c´arcel circular crin flor l´ıbido\n\nframe (work) bile prison circular horse’s mane flower libido\n\nmetr´opoli miel sangre sien tos tribu v´ıctima\n\nmetropolis honey blood temple (on head) cough tribe victim\n\n´ can be masculine. Sart´en (fry/frying pan) is feminine in Spain but NB Armazon masculine in Mexico. This is also true of radio when it means “radio.” There is much variation in Spanish in the naming of new gadgets: el aspirador / la aspiradora el batidor / la batidora la freidora la lavadora el secador el tostador / la tostadora\n\nvacuum cleaner whisk deep-fat fryer washing machine hair dryer toaster\n\nThese modern gadgets become a gender minefield when we consider them in Mexico, and it serves no great purpose to dwell lengthily on them. However, as an illustration, and no more than this, of the other possibilities, the following genders are standard in Mexico: la aspiradora / la batidora / la secadora (hair dryer) And now for a piece of information that baffles the author as much as it will you. ´ Azucar (sugar) is masculine in Spain and other countries like Colombia, but feminine ´ in Mexico. That’s the easy bit. Since azucar is feminine in Mexico, you would expect the definite article preceding it to be la. But no. All Mexicans whom I have consulted make ´ it clear that they say el azucar. Furthermore, they say and write: El az´ucar es blanca / refinada / morena (brown). How you reconcile el in this case with the feminine form of the adjective, i.e. blanca, etc., is anyone’s guess. Here is an attempt at an explanation. The ´ author suspects that most Mexicans confuse the initial a of azucar with that of agua, for example, where el is required (see 1.1. ii above), to deal with the spoken stress on ´ the first a. But, there is no spoken stress on the initial a of azucar. It falls on the u. Of course, Iberian Spanish requires: El az´ucar es blanco/refinado/moreno. At the same time, ´ most dictionaries cover themselves by saying that azucar is masculine and feminine (ambos = both)! 24\n\n2 Definite/indefinite articles and noun gender\n\n2.5 Gender of compound nouns Another possible minefield, since many of these terms are fairly modern and therefore have unestablished forms, and, in keeping with the ease with which English lends itself to placing two or more nouns side by side, compound nouns are starting to burgeon in Spanish. However, the gender of compound nouns follows a certain logic. i Two masculine nouns are obviously masculine:\n\ncaf´e concierto caf´e teatro piso piloto\n\ncaf´e (with live music) dinner theater show apartment, flat\n\nretrato robot tiempo r´ecord veh´ıculo todo terreno\n\nphoto fit record time land rover, 4x4, off-road vehicle\n\nii Two feminine nouns are naturally feminine:\n\nbomba trampa etapa reina hora punta lengua madre madre patria\n\nbooby trap (bomb) star part (of cycle race) commute hour, rush hour mother tongue mother country\n\npalabra clave prueba reina\n\nkey word key event (in sports race)\n\nNB bocacalle (street turning) and madreselva (honeysuckle) now constitute single words and follow the above rule iii When two nouns are of different gender, the first determines the gender of the compound noun. Masculine nouns include:\n\ncami´on cisterna coche bomba coche cama coche patrulla\n\ntanker (vehicle) car bomb sleeper (train) patrol car\n\nfactor sorpresa gas ciudad papel moneda\n\nsurprise factor town gas paper money\n\nBut this is not true of radiorreceptor (radio receiver), which is masculine, since radio is feminine. iv Similarly, if the first noun is feminine, the compound noun is feminine:\n\ncama nido c´arcel modelo c´elula madre ciudad dormitorio\n\ntrundle bed, bunk bed prison in Barcelona mother cell (organism) dormitory town\n\nfecha tope hora pico (M) luz piloto zona euro\n\nfinal/closing date commute hour pilot light euro zone\n\nv Compound nouns formed with other parts of speech are usually masculine and form one word:\n\nabrelatas altavoz espantap´ajaros hazmerre´ır paraguas pararrayos\n\ncan opener loudspeaker scarecrow laughing stock umbrella lightning conductor\n\npasatiempo portavoz quedir´an quehaceres rompecabezas terremoto\n\nhobby, pastime spokesperson public opinion domestic chores puzzle earthquake 25\n\nA STUDENT GRAMMAR OF SPANISH\n\nFinally three other compound nouns: el/la purasangre (thoroughbred horse), la sinraz´on (injustice), la enhorabuena (congratulations).\n\n2.6 Words distinguished by the ending a/o Because of its distinctive gender endings, Spanish does not have many words with the same form but different meanings. However, as in Italian, there are numerous pairs of words distinguished only by a and o endings which are easily confused, and are a splendid test of your memory. The Mexicans do not make it any easier as with bolso/bolsa below. These are known as gender paronyms, or doublets (dobletes in Spanish). Below is a small selection of such testing words, so put your memory cap on now:\n\n26\n\nFeminine\n\nMasculine\n\nacera sidewalk, pavement acta minutes, record of a meeting arca chest, box banca banking (as system) bolsa (any) bag, lady’s purse / handbag (M), Stock Exchange (Bolsa) bomba bomb, pump ˜ cana reed, stalk, (sugar) cane, (fishing) rod, beer glass carga load to be carried, charge (military and explosive) casa house copa wine glass, trophy, top of tree cuenta account, bill fonda tavern, small restaurant fosa grave, sea / land depression fruta fruit (as on the table) Note that frutos secos = nuts helada frost\n\nacero steel acto action, deed, act (in play) arco arch(way), bow (violin, archery) banco bank (as individual establishment), bench bolso lady’s purse / handbag bombo bass drum ˜ cano pipe, jet cargo burden, responsibility caso case, instance copo snowflake / cornflake cuento story, tale fondo bottom, background, fund foso pit, hole, ditch fruto fruit (as on a tree) helado ice-cream\n\n2 Definite/indefinite articles and noun gender\n\nlibra pound (weight, money) manga sleeve (coat, shirt) marca brand, trademark, record (sport), stain moda fashion, style ˜ muneca wrist, female doll pala shovel, spade papelera waste (paper) basket, paper mill partida departure, register, certificate (of birth/marriage/death), game (chess) pata leg (of animal) pimienta pepper (for seasoning) ∗ plata silver, money (M) puerta door punta point, sharp end rata rat seta mushroom tormenta storm (usually violent) trama plot, intrigue vela sail, candle\n\nlibro book mango handle marco frame (of picture) modo way (of doing something), method ˜ muneco ˜ male doll (muneco de nieve = snowman) palo stick, post, mast papelero paper manufacturer partido (political) party, game (football) pato duck pimiento pepper (vegetable) plato plate, dish, course of meal puerto port, pass (in mountains) punto dot, speck, point (in scoring) rato short time seto hedge tormento torment, anguish tramo section, stretch (of road) velo veil\n\n* At the risk of emphasizing the generation gap between reader and author, Plata is also the name of the Lone Ranger’s horse = Silver. If, like the author as a child, you followed the western series entitled The Lone Ranger (El Llanero solitario), you would know what I mean.\n\n2.7 Misleading similarities This section is less to do with grammar than with semantics or fields of meaning. However, it seems useful to introduce you to the problem of “misleading similarities” or falsos amigos which include not only nouns but also verbs and adjectives. By “misleading similarities,” we mean a word which has a similar form in two languages but which has 27\n\nA STUDENT GRAMMAR OF SPANISH\n\ndifferent meanings in both languages. The expression falso amigo is less common in Spanish than in French (faux ami) where the phenomenon is very frequent (French > English and vice versa – and Italian > English and vice versa for that matter), although among the well-informed it is well known. Interference from one language to another is likely in these cases, so it is worthwhile giving special attention to them. Mexican importations from the USA can also produce considerable confusion. (See * after the list below.) So, when you consult a Spanish-speaking physician / doctor, you don’t want to be treated for a cold when you are constipated, and you don’t want to consult a psychotherapist for embarrassment when you are pregnant (see constipado and embarazada below). And never treat your carpeta like a carpet or your company will soon be plunged into bankruptcy, or you will fail your examinations. Also be careful with the use of lujuria and lujo, listed below. In order then to avoid these pitfalls, give some attention to this small list of the most common falsos amigos (there are many more): Falso amigo\n\nEnglish equivalent\n\nEnglish cognate\n\nSpanish equivalent\n\nactual la barraca la carpeta la confidencia ∗ constipado la decepci´on la desgracia el disgusto embarazada el ´exito fastidioso gracioso la ingenuidad largo la lectura la librer´ıa la lujuria la miseria el muslo notorio la pinta quitar sensible simp´atico el suceso la tabla\n\npresent, i.e. now hut, shed file, folder confidential remark cold disappointment misfortune displeasure pregnant success annoying witty, funny (person) frankness long reading bookstore/shop lust poverty, squalor thigh famous appearance, look to remove / take away sensitive nice event board\n\nactual barracks carpet confidence constipated deception disgrace disgust embarrassed exit fastidious gracious ingenuity large lecture library luxury misery muscle notorious pint to quit sensible sympathetic success table\n\nverdadero, real el cuartel la alfombra la confianza estre˜nido el enga˜no la verg¨uenza, el esc´andalo el asco, la aversi´on confuso, ∗∗ violento la salida quisquilloso, puntilloso afable, cort´es el ingenio, la ingeniosidad extenso, amplio, ancho la conferencia, la clase la biblioteca el lujo la pena, el sufrimiento el m´usculo de mala fama = medio litro dejar, salir de sensato, prudente compasivo, comprensivo el ´exito la mesa\n\n* You can understand the confusion here if you consider the etymology of these two words. Constipado and “constipated” come from the Latin stipor = “to compress” / “fill” / “block up.” It should be added that Mexican Spanish can be ambiguous here. Constipado can mean “constipated” in Mexico, so that if you went to a Mexican physician/doctor, and said you were constipado, you would need to add, for example: Tengo la nariz tapada (My nose is blocked up) or: Estoy constipado de la panza/del est´omago.\n\n28\n\n2 Definite/indefinite articles and noun gender\n\n** Yes, strange as it may seem, violento can certainly have the meaning of “embarrassed,” as in: Si te sientes violenta, volveremos a casa = If you feel embarrassed, we’ll go home. Mexico does not use violento with this meaning, and would offer apenado, for example. Of course, violento has the meaning of “violent” in both countries.\n\nEjemplos Es un chiste muy gracioso Es el gr"
