It is claimed that\n\nmore than 1,900,000 French troops, in-\n\ncluding 29,000 officers, have been cap-\n\ntured.\n\nMilitary authorities in London contest\n\nthe accuracy of the German figures. The\n\nGerman policy of understating losses it\n\nis pointed out, is notorious and the pre-\n\nsent figures represent such jugglery as\n\n- to be an extreme test of the German\n\npeople's credulity. It is remembered that\n\na German broadcast on June 4 gave the\n\ncasualties from May 10 to June 1 as\n\n10,252 killed, 42,523 wounded and 8,463\n\nmissing-considerably less than half the\n\nlosses now admitted. It would appear\n\nthat vast German losses were suffered\n\nduring the days preceding the French\n\narmistice when the French resistance\n\nwas steadily diminishing. The Germans,\n\napparently with an eye on their former\n\nstatement, achieved a balance by declar-\n\ning their losses from June 5 to Jone\n\n25 as 16,822 killed, 68,511 wounded and\n\n9,921 missing. These figures, added to\n\nthose broadcast on June 4, give the pre-\n\nsent admitted total. The Germans now\n\ncalculate from June 5, omitting four\n\ndays in June when there was very bitter\n\nfighting with heavy German casualties\n\nduring the Allied retreat on Dunkerque.\n\n.Military authorities in London on June\n\n5 estimated the German losses at be-\n\ntween 300,000 and 400.000.\n\nThree Forts Hold Out.\n\nLONDON, July 3.-An Order-of-the\n\nt>ay issued in Vichyyby General Weygand\n\n(French Minister for Defence and Com-\n\nmander-in-Chief) states that 22.000\n\nFrench troops in the Maginot Line who\n\nwere unaware of the armistice fought\n\non for five days after the \"cease fire\"\n\norder.\n\nLast Force to Resist.\n\nLONDON, July 4.-The last French fort\n\nflying the tricolour, near the Swiss fron-\n\ntier, fell yesterday, and the swastika was\n\nhoisted. This morning it was lowered,\n\nwhen the Germans withdrew from the,\n\nLyons area.\n\nThe French Fleet Seized.\n\nLONDON. July 4.-Addressing the\n\nHouse of Commons this afternoon the\n\nPrime Minister (Mr. Churchill) said:\n\n\"It is with sincere sorrow that I must\n\nnow announce the measures we have felt\n\nbound to take to order to prevent the\n\nFrench fleet from falling into German\n\nhands. When two nations are fighting\n\ntogether under a solemn alliance against\n\na common foe, one might be stricken\n\ndown and overwhelmed, and might be\n\nforced to ask its ally for release from its\n\nobligations. The least that could be ex-\n\npected was that when the French Gov-\n\nernment was abandoning the conflict it\n\nwould have been careful not to inflict\n\nneedless injury on faithful comrades in\n\nwhose final victory the sole chance of\n\nFrench freedom lay and lies.\n\n\"We offered fully to release the French\n\nGovernment from its treaty obligations\n\non one condition-that the French fleet\n\n1 should sail to British harbours before the\n\narmistice negotiations were completed.\n\nThis was not done. On the contrary, de-\n\nspite every kind of personal promise and\n\nassurance from the Chief of the French\n\nNavai Staff (Admiral Darían), an armis\n\ntice was signed which was bound to place\n\nthe fleet safely in the power of Germany\n\nand Italy. (Laughter.) Many French war-\n\nships unable to reach African ports en\n\n,' tered Portsmouth and Plymouth har-\n\nbours about ten days ago.\n\n\"I must place on record that what\n\nmight have been a mortal injury was done\n\nto us by the Bordeaux Government with\n\nfull knowledge of the circumstances of\n\nour danger and after rejecting our ap-\n\npeals. There is another example of this.\n\nOver 400 German pilots were taken\n\nprisoner in France, many of whom the\n\nRoyal Air Force shot down. I obtained a\n\npromise from M.'Beynaud (then French\n\nPrime Minister) that they should be sent\n\nto England. Orders were given to that\n\n;; effect, but when the Reynaud Govern\n\n!> ment fell the pilots were delivered to\n\nGermany, doubtless to win favour for the\n\nBordeaux Government with its Gprman\n\nmasters. Apart from the injury done to\n\nus, this shows that Germany is feeling a\n\nshortage of skilled pilots.\n\n\"It seems particularly odious that these\n\n400 pilots should have been handed over\n\nin the sure knowledge that they would\n\nbomb this country and force our airmen\n\nto shoot them down a second time. His-\n\ntory will not condone such wrongful\n\ndeeds. I firmly believe that a generation\n\nof Frenchmen will arise who will acquit\n\ntheir national honour.\n\n\"Never in my experience liuvo 1 .seen a\n\nCabinet discuss so grim and sombre a\n\nquestion as the fate of the French fleet\n\nThe Cabinet decided unanimously wi» ri\n\naching hearts, to seize the flr-pi \"\n\nYesterday morning, continued Mr\n\nChurchill, after all preparations had\n\nbeen made, Britain took a great part of\n\nthe French fleet under her control, or\n\ncalled upon French warships, with ade-\n\nquate force, lo comply with Britain's re-\n\nquirements. Two battleships, two light\n\ncruisers, some submarines, including the\n\nSurcouf (2,880 tons), eight destroyers and\n\napproximately 200 smaller and extremely\n\nuseful vessels, including minesweepers\n\nand anti-submarine craft, which were\n\nmostly at Portsmouth, Plymouth or\n\nSheerness, were boarded by superior\n\nforces after brief notices had been served,\n\nwherever possible, on .the captains. This\n\noperation was successfully carried out\n\nwithout resistance or bloodshed, except\n\nin one instance where a scuffle arose\n\nthrough a misunderstanding on the Sur\n\ncouf. One British leading seaman was\n\nkilled, two British officers and a rating\n\nwere wounded and one French officer\n\nwas killed and a rating injured. For\n\nthe rest, thc French sailors, in the main,\n\ncheerfully accepted the end of a period\n\nof uncertainty, and between 800 and\n\n900 expressed a desire to continue the\n\nwar. Some had asked for British nation-\n\nality, and this Britain was prepared to\n\ngrant without prejudice to the other\n\nFrenchmen numbering some thousands\n\nwho preferred to fight on as Frenchmen.\n\nThe rest of the crews would be im-\n\nmediately repatriated to French ports\n\nif the French Government was able to\n\nmake arrangements for' their reception\n\nby agreement with their German rulers.\n\nIt was also proposed to repatriate French\n\ntroops, with the exception of those who\n\nhad volunteered to serve under General\n\nde Gaulle in the French forces of libera-\n\ntion. Several French submarines had\n\nalso joined the British Navy Indepen-\n\ndently and their services had been ac-\n\ncepted.\n\nMr. Churchill then turned to the\n\nMediterranean. At Alexandria, he said,\n\nwhere a strong British battle fleet was\n\nlying, there were a number of French\n\nvessels including a battleship, four\n\ncruisers, including three mounting 81n.\n\nguns, and a number of smaller ships.\n\nThese had been informed that they\n\nwould not be permitted -to leave har-\n\nbour and thus fall within the power^of\n\nGermany or Italy. Negotiations and dis-\n\ncussions had taken place and measures\n\ntaken to ensure that the ships would be\n\nsunk or otherwise made to comply with\n\nBritain's wishes. The anguish which this\n\nhad caused to British and French naval\n\nofficers could well be imagined. Only this\n\nmorning, during an Italian air-raid on\n\nAlexandria, some of the French ships had\n\nfired heavily and effectively with the\n\nBritish ships against the common enemy.\n\nBritain would offer the fullest facili-\n\nties to the men at Alexandria who wished\n\nto continue In the war and would pro-\n\nvide for and maintain them. All the rest\n\nwould be repatriated.\n\nUltimatum at Oran.\n\nThe Prime Minister then dealt with\n\nthat section~of the French fleet at Oran\n\n(the base in Algeria), which he called\n\nthe most serious part of the story. He\n\nsaid that two of the finest French ves-\n\nsels, thè Dunkerque and the Strasbourg,\n\ntwo modern battle cruisers each of 26,000\n\ntons and superior to the German\n\nScharnhorst, and two battleships, several\n\nlight cruisers and a number of de-\n\nstroyers and submarines were at Oran\n\nand its adjacent ports on\" thé North\n\nAfrican coast. Yesterday morning a\n\ncarefully selected British naval officer\n\n-Captain Holland, formerly Naval\n\nAttache in Paris-was chosen to inter-\n\nview the French Admiral and, after hav-\n\ning been refused an interview, he pre-\n\nsented a document, the operative para-\n\ngraph of which was as follows:\n\nIt is impossible for us to allow your\n\n? fine ships to fall into the power of\n\nthe German or Italian enemy. We\n\nare determined to fight on to the end\n\nand, if we win, as we think, we shall,\n\nwe shall never forget that France is\n\nour ally, that our interests are the\n\nsame as hers, and the common enemy\n\nis Germany.- Should we conquer, we\n\ndeclare we shall restore the greatness\n\nand territory of France. For this pur-\n\npose we must make sure that the best\n\nships of the French Navy are not used\n\nagainst us by the common foe. In\n\nthese circumstances, His Majesty's < lov\n\nernment has instructed me to den and\n\nthe French fleet at Oran shall a< t in\n\naccordance with one of the folio ving\n\nalternatives:\n\n(1) Sail with us and continui the\n\nfight for victory against Gen tany\n\nand Italy.\n\n(2) Sail with reduced crews under\n\nour control to British ports. The\n\nreduced crews will be repatriated at\n\nthe earliest possible moment, j\n\n(3) The French ships to be taken\n\nto a West Indies port, where they\n\n. will remain until the end of the war,\n\nand the crews to be repatriated.\n\nIf all of these offers are refused the\n\nFrench ships will have to be sunk\n\nwithin six hours.\n\nFinally, Captain Holland said that he.\n\nhad orders to use force to prevent the\n\nships from falling into German or Italian\n\nhands.\n\nContinuing, Mr. Churchill said that\n\nBritain had hoped that one of these\n\nalternatives would have been accepted\n\nwithout the necessity of using the terrible\n\nforce of a British battle squadron. This\n\nsquadron was outside Oran two hours\n\nafter Captain Holland arrived there in\n\na destroyer. The squadron was com-\n\nmanded by Vice-Admiral Sir James\n\nSomerville, who had helped to bring off\n\nmore than 100.000 French troops from\n\nDunkerque. He had with him a large\n\ncruiser force and strong flotillas. The\n\nparleys continued all day, and it was\n\nhoped, until the afternoon, that the pro-\n\nmises would be accepted without blood-\n\nshed. No doubt the commander of the\n\nFrench squadron was acting in accord-\n\nance with orders dictated by the Germans\n\nat Wiesbaden, where the Armistice Com-\n\nmission was sitting.\n\nThe French admiral refused to com-\n\nply and announced his intention of fight-\n\ning. Admiral Somerville was ordered\n\nto complete his mission before dark-\n\nness fell and. at 5.58 p.m., he opened\n\nfire on the powerful French fleet. Fire\n\nwas also directed on shore batteries. At\n\n6 p.m. he reported that he was heavily\n\nengaged. The action lasted 10 minutes\n\nand was followed by heavy attacks by\n\nnaval aircraft carried on the Ark Royal.\n\nAt 7,20 o'clock he forwarded a 'further\n\nreport stating that a battle-cruiser\n\nof the Strasbourg type had been dam-\n\naged and was ashore; another battle-\n\nship of the Bretagne class had been\n\nsunk and another of the same class\n\nheavily damaged. Two French de-\n\nstroyers and an aircraft carrier had also\n\nbeen sunk or burnt. The other battle\n\ncruiser had managed to slip out of the\n\nharbour in a gallant effort to reach Tou-\n\nlon or a North African port under Ger\n\nI man control, in accordance with the\n\narmistice terms. She was pursued by the\n\nfleet air arm and hit by at least one\n\ntorpedo, she may have been joined by j\n\nother craft from Morocco, and they were !\n\n! able to reach Toulon before they could\n\nbe overtaken. The battle-cruiser which\n\nescaped would at any rate be out of\n\naction for many months.\n\nMr. Churchill said that he was afraid\n\nthat the French must have suffered\n\nheavy loss of life, as the British navy\n\nhad had to use severe measures, and\n\nseveral immense explosions were heard.\n\nHowever, none, of the British ships was\n\naffected in gunpower or mobility. He\n\nnone Help\n\nroad not received any reports of casual-\n\nties. Admiral Somerville'^ fleet was in\n\nevery respect intact and ready for ser-\n\nvice.\n\nThe Italian navy, for whose reception\n\narrangements had also been made and\n\nwhich was considerably stronger than\n\nthe British fleet at Oran, kept out of the\n\nway. It was hoped its turn would come\n\nduring operations which would be taken\n\nto secure effective British command of\n\nthe Mediterranean.\n\nSumming the whole position up, Mr.\n\nChurchill said that a large proportion\n\nof the French fleet had therefore passed\n\ninto British hands\" or been put out of\n\naction, or otherwise withheld from Ger-\n\nmany by yesterday's events. The House\n\nwould not expect him to say anything\n\nabout-the French ships which had ac-\n\ncepted the inflexible resolve to do every-\n\nthing possible to prevent them falling\n\ninto Germany's hands. He would leave\n\nthe judgment of Britain's action, with\n\nconfidence, to Parliament, he would leave\n\nit to the Nation; he would leave it to\n\nthe United States; he would leave it t«»\n\nthe world and history.\n\nOran Battle Reactions.\n\nLONDON, July 5.-There has yet been\n\nlittle official addition to the story of\n\nBritain's seizure of the French fleet as\n\nrecounted by the Prime Minister (MT.\n\nChurchill) in the House of Commons on\n\nThursday afternoon. Ti-a reactions of\n\nthe naval fighting at Oran (the French\n\nbase on the North African coast) and the\n\nsubsequent attitude bf Marshal Petain's\n\nFrench Government in subservience to\n\nGermany have engendered a new situa-\n\ntion in British -relations with France\n\nwhich may be of far-reaching conse-\n\nquence.\n\nAccording to German reports (which\n\nquote both Italian and French sources)\n\nthe battle-cruiser Dunkerque (26,500\n\ntons) the battleship Provence (22,189\n\ntons), and the Flotilla-Leader Mogador\n\n(2,884 tons) were set on fire at Oran\n\nwhile the battleship Bretagne (22,189\n\ntons) struck a magnetic mine and was\n\nblown up. It is said that it was the\n\nbattle-cruiser Strasbourg 26,500 tons),\n\nwith five flotilla leaders and a number of\n\ntorpedo boats and submarines, which\n\nbroke through the British squadron and\n\nescaped to France. There is no con-\n\nfirmation of a report received through\n\nGeneva last night that there was« an\n\naction between British and French fleets\n\noff Casablanca (Morocco).\n\nFrom Alexandria it is reported that\n\nno information has yet been officially\n\ngiven- out regarding the future of the\n\nFrench squadron there. Meanwhile, the\n\nBritish and French fleets remain in har-\n\nbour and everything is outwardly calm.\n\nIt is understood that more French war\n\nvessels are at present at anchorages in\n\nScottish waters in addition to those men\n\ntioned by Mr. Churchill yesterday as\n\nbeing taken over in British ports.\n\nLast night the following communique\n\nattributed to the Petain Government at\n\nVichy was received in a dispatch trans-\n\nmitted through Geneva:\n\n\"British warships arrived yesterday\n\nmorning off Mere el Kebir (near Oran)\n\nand gave Admiral Gensoul (the French\n\ncommander of the squadron at Oran) a\n\nsix-hour ultimatum to surrender or\n\nscuttle his ships. British seaplanes laid\n\nmagnetic mines at the entrance of the\n\nharbour before the expiry of the ulti-\n\nmatum. Admiral Gensoul rejected the\n\nultimatum, whereupon the British ships\n\nopened fire. This aggression was the\n\nmore serious because it was committed\n\nby allies of yesterday. The French re-\n\nturned the fire. The French Government\n\nhas now ordered the French warships\n\nat Alexandria to sail immediately for a\n\nFrench port, fighting their way out if\n\nnecessary. It has also ordered French\n\nwarships on the high seas to halt all\n\nBritish merchantmen and to fire if at-\n\ntacked.\"\n\nThe German wireless, quoting an offi-\n\ncial Italian dispatch last night, said\n\nthat the French Government had or-\n\ndered that any British ships or planes\n\ncoming within 12¿ miles of French ter-\n\nritory \"should be attacked at once,\" and\n\nthis applied to French overseas posses-\n\nsions as well as to the Continent of\n\n¡Europe. It went on to say that the\n\nFrench Government had ordered French\n\nwarships at Alexandria to attempt to\n\nbreak through to Bizert (Tunis) and had\n\nordered French ships lying in the ports\n\nof Britain to force their way to Brest.\n\nAccording to a German radio an-\n\nnouncement yesterday, Hitler gave per-\n\nmission to the French Government to\n\nscuttle French warships wherever neces-\n\nsary to avoid their falling into Britain's\n\nhands.\n\nThe German Press and wireless vio\n\n[ lently abuse Britain and Mr. Churchill for\n\nthe action against the French fleet. It\n\nis declared that \"all previous British\n\ncrimes fade out by comparison with this\n\nlatest act of piracy by plutocratic free-\n\nbooters.'\" The Nazi paper \"Angriff\" warns\n\nthe British people to remove Mr. Churchill\n\n\"or else they will be punished for his\n\ncrimes.\"\n\nItalian Fleet's Absence.\n\nIn his statement in the House of Com-\n\nmons on the action at Oran, Mr,\n\nChurchill said that the Italian navy, for\n\nwhose reception arrangements had been\n\nmade and which was considerably\n\nstronger than the British fleet at Oran,\n\nkept out of the way. It was hoped that\n\nits turn would come during operations\n\nwhich would be taken to secure effective\n\nBritish command of the Mediterranean.\n\nA Geneva dispatch yesterday morning\n\nsaid that it was reported from Berlin\n\nthat the Italian war fleet was proceeding\n\nunder forced' draught io aid the Fren\n\noff Oran. A message from Rome duri\n\nthe afternoon stated that an offlc\n\nspokesman refused to confirm or de\n\nthis report. Such information could r\n\nbe made available, he said, because it co\n\nstituted a military secret. The Roi\n\nzadio declared this morning that t\n\nItalian navy did not intervene at Or\n\nbecause it could not get there in time.\n\nThere ls ground for believing that Hit:\n\ncommunicated with the Italian fleet w\n\nbefore the action began, but the Italia\n\ndeclined to meet the British,\n\nj While Germany is raging against t\n\ndefeat of her plan to acquire a gi*\n\nfleet for the Axis, there is general reco\n\nnition of the gallantry of the Pren\n\nsailors-to which Mr. Churchill paid\n\ntribut*-in disdaining the orders frc\n\n\"Scuttler-in-chief\" Hitler, and, in £\n\ntempting to fight their way out, blinc\n\nobeying orders of which many of the pt\n\nsonne! were known to disapprove. ?\n\nMr. Menzies Speaks.\n\nMELBOURNE, July 5.-\"It Is,\n\ncourse, a wretched business that i\n\nshould, find ourselves in conflict wi\n\nthe French, but there can be no dou\n\nthat the action taken by the British Ai\n\nmira!ty is correct,\" said the Prime Mini\n\nter (Mr. Menzies) today when commen\n\ning on the British seizure of Freni\n\nnaval vessels.\n\nAmerican Applause.\n\nNEW YORK, July 4.-The Britii\n\nPrime Minister (Mr. Churchill) need ha1\n\nHo qualms If he leaves judgment of tl\n\nBritish action with regard to the Frene\n\nfleet to United States opinion. Tl\n\nanswer is definite and virtually unan\n\nmous-complete approval.\n\nThe chairman of the Senate Foreii\n\nRelations Committee (Senator Pittmai\n\nsaid in Washington today that Britain\n\nseizure of portions of the French fie\n\nhad met with wide approval from h\n\ncolleagues and had restored confldeni\n\nin the British war efforts.\n\nThe general feeling in naval circli\n\nis that Britain was completely just\n\nfled. There is no comment official!\n\nbut privately the greatest satisfaction\n\nexpressed. It is believed in naval circli\n\nthat the smaller units of the Frene\n\nfleet will be very valuable for tl\n\nBritish coastal defence.\n\nThe New York \"Herald-Tribune\" in\n\ntruly remarkable editorial, says: \"The:\n\ncan be no doubt about history's verdii\n\nand even less about this country's . . .\n\nfor this swift action has made' two thin§\n\nindelibly plain and these are the only tra\n\ntilings that now matter. lt has show\n\nthat British democracy is finally 'capan]\n\nof acting in its own defence with pei\n\nemptory decision, with a bold disregar\n\nof small fears and traditional forms, wit\n\n. aggressive power to grasp the fundamen\n\ntate of the situation and with the effec\n\ntlve will for victory which the Nazi\n\nthemselves have displayed. And th\n\nBritish action has thrown the total mort\n\nbankruptcy of the Vichy Government int\n\nmemorable and Inescapable relief. A Gov\n\neminent which could betray its all\n\nas this Government did and then convex\n\nitself into a tool, which this episode show\n\ntb to be, of the Nazi conquest is no longe\n\nFrance .... Britain lias found finall\n\none thing which the democratic Power\n\nhave lacked through all these fantastl\n\nyears-the will to fight regardless of th\n\nconsequences; the will to victory what\n\never the costs, and the will to tak\n\nwhatever risks are necessary. That spirj\n\nentitles them to every aid which th)\n\ncountry can give them and it means tha\n\nthe struggle, having entered upon thi\n\nheroic plane, can yet be won.\"\n\nThe Los Angeles \"Times\" says: \"Tha\n\nsuch damage could be inflicted in S'\n\nshort a time on the best of the Frene]\n\nwarships Indicates that the English hav\n\nlost none of their traditional ocean prow\n\ness. The concluding portion of Mi\n\nChurchill's speech indicates that an at\n\ntack on Britain ls imminent. He appear:\n\nto be confident that it can be met sue\n\ncessfully, and certainly the battle of Orai\n\nhas done nothing to diminish that con\n\nfldence.\"\n\nIn this connection, there is an arrest-\n\ning dispatch from the Rome correspond'\n\nent of the \"New York Times,\" who tele\n\nphoned as follows: \"As a sample of nava\n\npower, the British action has clearly givex\n\nthe Italians food for thought, as also hai\n\nthe fact that the British have demon\n\nstrated that they can be tough. Anothei\n\nobvious corollary of the situation is th«\n\nrealisation that Britain means busines\n\nwhen she says she is out to fight this wai\n\nto a finish. The average Italian has re-\n\nfused to believe that and there are manj\n\nothers who have thought that one or tw<\n\nheavy bombings would induce the Brltist\n\nto yield. However, there can be littl«\n\ndoubt in Italian minds that the Britlsl\n\nare not bluffing.\"\n\nA Break with Britain.\n\nLONDON, July 7.-It was officially an-\n\nnounced in Vichy on Friday night thai\n\nthe Petain Government had decided U\n\nbreak off diplomatic relations with Bri-\n\ntain as a result of the battle of Orar\n\nM. Baudouin, Foreign Minister in thc\n\nPetain Government, announcing its deci-\n\nsion in Vichy on Friday nigbt, outlinec\n\nAnglo-French relations in recent years anc\n\nsuggested that the sanctions against Itnlj\n\nand even the French entry into the wai\n\nwere dictated by a desire \"to do nothing\n\nwhich would dissociate us from thc\n\nforeign policy of Britain.\" \"Today,\" he\n\nsaid, \"is a turning point in our history\n\nTies of comradeship and excessive fidelity\n\nhave been broken and our relations with\n\nBritain are being placed on a new foot-\n\ning. Britain's attack on Our ships at\n\nOran will be an indelible blot on British\n\nhonour. The battleship Bretagne is a\n\ntotal loss and the battle-cruiser Dun-\n\nkerque was badly damaged. The sanctions\n\nmove, which separated us from Italy, was\n\nsolely due to the anxiety for harmony\n\nwith Britain. The same is true of our\n\npolicy regarding Central Europe and Ger-\n\nmany. The Munich negotiations were\n\n,. personally conducted by Mr. Chamber-\n\nlain, and we entered the war against\n\nGermany in the wake of Britain.\"\n\nM. Baudouin also sought to blame Bri-\n\ntain for the French defeat.

As soon as it was\n\nrealised that France must surrender, con-\n\nsultations were held between the British\n\nCommander-in-Chief and Admiral God\n\nfroy (the French Commander) in the\n\nhope that lt would be possible to con-\n\ntinue to fight side by side.\n\n\"When the terms of the armistice be-\n\ncame known, it was evident that a new\n\nsituation had developed. Admiral Godfrey\n\nwas asked to consider various proposals\n\non the lines of those sent to the French\n\nat Oran. In view of the fact that there\n\nwas no possibility of taking the French\n\nships to sea and that such an attempt\n\nwould only endanger valuable French\n\nlives, Admiral Godfrey agreed:\n\n(1) To put the ships into a condi-\n\ntion in which they could not go to\n\nsea, which was done by reducing\n\nthe oil aboard.\n\n(2) To demilitarise the ships, which\n\nwas done by landing certain portions ¡\n\nof the armament and placing them j\n\nunder the care of the French authori-\n\nties ashore.\n\n(3) To reduce the crews in order to!\n\nleave sufficient only for cate and\n\nmaintenance, which is being donc\n\nnow.\n\n\"The crews are going to Syria and will\n\nbe sent to France later, as the French\n\nAdmiralty decided. Britain has guaran-\n\nteed supplies and the pay of the men\n\nretained on the ships and their return\n\nto France at the end of the war. It is\n\nhoped that these conditions will con-\n\ntinue. Terrible events of which all know\n\nhave been avoided. Our only wish has\n\nbeen to make sure that the Italians and\n\nthe Germans do not possess the French\n\nships for use against the British.\"\n\nThe French ships at Alexandria in-\n\nclude a battleship, four cruisers and a\n\nnumber of smaller vessels.\n\nSpeaking in the House of Commons\n\nthis afternoon, the First Lord of the\n\nAdmiralty (Mr. Alexander) revealed that\n\nthe Richelieu was put out of action yes-\n\nterday by depth charges and aircraft at-\n\ntacks while lt lay at anchor at Dakar.\n\n[The Richelieu, a 35,000-ton battle-\n\nship mounting eight 151n. and fifteen 6in.\n\nguns and carrying four aircraft, was\n\nlaunched on January 17, 1939. Her\n\nengines were designed to give a speed\n\nof over 30 knots.' She is France's big-\n\ngest completed warship. Three other\n\nships of the same class were laid down\n\nafter the Richelieu-the Jean Bart\n\n(which was due to be completed in 1941),\n\nthe Clemenceau and the Gascogne (due\n\nto be completed in 1942-43).]\n\nMr. Alexander said that the Richelieu\n\nwas the most formidable French capital\n\nship immediately available for operations\n\nand the Government decided that steps\n\nmust be taken to prevent her from falling\n\ninto the enemy's hands in a condition\n\nin which she could be used aganist Bri-\n\ntain. A British force was dispatched to\n\nDakar with proposals similar to those\n\noffered to the French fleet, at Oran and\n\nan officer was sent ahead in a sloop on\n\nSunday to present them, but on ap-\n\nproaching he was informed that\n\nthe French would open fire if\n\nthe sloop came closer to the port. Later,\n\nhowever, the French consented to receive\n\nthe proposals by signal. The proposals\n\nwere: (1) That the Richelieu should sail\n\nwith a reduced crew, under escort, to a\n\nBritish port, Britain to guarantee that\n\nthe crew would be repatriated; (2) that\n\nshe should sail with a reduced crew to the\n\nWest Indies; (3) that she should be de-\n\nmilitarised at Dakar within twelve hours; j\n\n(4) that she would be sunk within the\n\ntime limit. \\\n\nMr. Alexander said that no satisfac-\n\ntory reply was received within the time\n\nlimit. The British commander, how-\n\never, waited longer before carrying out\n\nthe order to use force. Finally it was\n\nclear that the French did not intend to\n\naccede to the conditions and the British\n\ncommander was forced to carry out his\n\npainful duty early yesterday. A ship's\n\nboat was sent into the harbour with\n\ndepth charges and went by the port\n\nquarter of the Richelieu. The depth,\n\ncharges were dropped close under the\n\nstern in order to damage the propellers!\n\nand steering gear. The boat then began j\n\nits return to the British forces, but broke\n\ndown and lay helpless for a time. One\n\nengine, however, was got running as the\n\nboat was sighted by the French and,\n\nthough pursued, the boat escaped.\n\nThe main attack, Mr. Alexander said,\n\nwas entrusted to aircraft of the Fleet Air\n\nArm and took place after the attack by\n\nthe motor boat, which was, however, still\n\nIn the harbour. The planes attacked\n\nwith torpedoes and the men on the motor\n\nboat heard five explosions and saw smoke\n\nissuing from the battleship. \"The Riche-\n\nlieu has a list to port and is down by the\n\nstern,\" Mr. Alexander said. \"A large\n\nquantity of oil is on the surface of\n\nthe water round the ship. Despite heavy\n\nanti-aircraft fire, all our aircraft returned\n\nsafely.\"\n\nThere remained to be dealt with, Mr.\n\nAlexander said, only one sister ship of\n\nthe Richelieu, and this would not be\n\ncompleted for some months to come. The\n\ntransfer of these modern capital ships to\n\nGermany would have altered the whole\n\nbalance of naval strength and this gravo\n\nanxiety was now relieved.\n\nFrench Success Claimed.\n\nLONDON, July 9.-The Rome news-\n\npaper \"La Tribuna\" published last night\n\na report from Algiers which said that it\n\nwas believed that French naval units had\n\nsunk four convoyed British ships off\n\nCasablanca (French Morocco) and that\n\na group of French submarines had sunk\n\na British cruiser.\n\nIt was announced at Toulon last night\n\nthat the seaplane-carrier Commandant\n\nTeste (10,000 tons), which was claimed\n\nby the British Admiralty to have been\n\nsunk or burnt in the Oran action last\n\nweek, was not at Oran at the time of the\n\naction, but was safe in a French port.\n\nMartinique Mystery.\n\nWASHINGTON, July 9.-British\n\nofficials have assured the United States\n\nGovernment that the British Navy is\n\nnot blockading Martinique (the French\n\ncolony in the West Indies).

The\n\nsituation, he said, had not been clari-\n\nfied.\n\nIt is believed that If the French ships\n\nat Martinique were to make a dash for\n\nUnited States ports, they would not be\n\nmolested, but if they headed for Europe\n\nthey would be fallowed by the British\n\nships, which woulr1 be careful not to stop\n\nthem within the 300-mile \"safety zone.\"\n\nLONDON, July 9.-The Grenoble news-\n\npaper, \"Petit Dauphinois\" says that Bri-\n\ntish action against the French naval\n\nunits at Martinique, which include several\n\nsubmarines, the aircraft-carrier Beam\n\nand the Jeanne d'Arc is believed to be\n\nimminent.\n\nDe Gaulle's Approval.\n\nLONDON, July 9.--A moving broadcast\n\naddress on the battle of Oran\n\nwas given from London last night\n\nby General de Gaulle, organiser\n\nof the French National Committee\n\nfor the continuation of the struggle\n\nagainst the dictators.\n\nGeneral de Gaulle asked Britons not\n\nto regard the Oran action as a direct\n\nnaval success, because the French ships\n\nwere unable to fight.\n\n\"I ask the French people,\" he contin«\n\n|;- . tied, \"to cposlder things from .the ooJj\n\nViewpoint which counts, namely, victors\n\nand liberation.

She aims to be a\n\ngreat military and industrial power, with\n\nthe Continent as a colonial territory,\n\nfeeding her and buying her goods but not\n\nallowed to industrialise in competition\n\nwith her. The great French industries\n\nare doomed to sudden extinction or slow\n\ndecay. The French people will become\n\nhewers of wood and tillers of the soil for\n\ntheir German masters.

During a\n\n[ lengthy tour of the coastal defences, an\n\n- authorised correspondent saw anti-tank\n\nobstacles and pillboxes and cleverly-con\n\nI cealed machine-gun nests established at\n\nvital points.\n\nThe Prime Minister (Mr. Churchill)\n\nvisited the Sussex coast last night and in-\n\nspected the defence scheme. Among the\n\nlatest precautionary measures, all beaches\n\ni and promenades from Brighton to Selsey\n\n1 have been closed to the public as from\n\nmidnight. The Secretary for War (Mr.\n\n.Eden) stated in the House of Commons\n\nJyesterday that all men registered for mili-\n\ntary service up to the end of May had\n\nnow been called up with- the exception\n\nof a few special categories.\n\nÍ According to a review by the German\n\nHigh Command of the war in the west,\n\nÎand the defeat of France, the only foe\n\nnow remaining to be conquered by Ger-\n\nmany is England.\n\n\"The bulk -of the German forces will\n\n, probably be ranged against Britain,\"\n\nI writes \"The Times\" diplomatic corre\n\n' spondent, \"but the speed and care with\n\nwhich German troops have secured an\n\n- overland route to North-Western Spain\n\nI and also the attention which German\n\nI propagandists and intriguers are giving\n\nI to Portugal reveal that the Germans have\n\n' put other irons into the fire.

While every\n\nj precaution must be taken, there are\n\ni no grounds to suppose that more Ger\n\n! man forces can be landed either by\n\nair or from the sea, than can. be\n\ndestroyed by the strong forces at pre-\n\nsent under arms. The Royal Air Force\n\nis in excellent order and at the\n\nhighest strength it has yet attained.\n\nThe German Navy was never so weak,\n\nnor the British Army at home so\n\nL strong.\n\nThe Prime Minister expects all His\n\nMajesty's servants in high places to\n\n1 set an example of steadiness and resolu-\n\ntion, and to check and rebuke any ex-\n\npression of loose or ill-digested opinion\n\nin their circles, or by subordinates.\n\nThey should not hesitate to report or\n\nremove officials who are consciously\n\nexercising a disturbing or depressing\n\ninfluence, or whose talk may be calcu\n\n! lated to spread alarm and despondency.\n\nI Thus alone will they be worthy of the\n\nfighting men who, in the air, on the\n\nsea, and on the land, have already\n\nmet the enemy without any sense of\n\nbeing outmatched in martial qualities.\n\nNew War Materials.\n\nLONDON, July 6.-It is announced by\n\nthe Ministry of Supply that big new\n\norders for war materials have Just been\n\nplaced with the United States and Cana-\n\ndian Governments.

The U\n\nboat simultaneously sighted the Sunder\n\nand. It dived, but the Sunderland was\n\nover it before its periscope submerged and\n\ndropped six bombs close to the port bow\n\nA mass of oil bubbles, each two feet\n\nwide, appeared on the water, and thc\n\npatches of oil increased as the Sunderland\n\ncircled to the vicinity.\n\n_ Another plane struck the starboard\n\nbeam of a second U-boat with bombs\n\nwhfle the submarin was submerging. Big\n\npatches of oil appeared and nothing more\n\nwas seen of the U-boat, although the\n\n! plane waited for three hours. A third U\n\nboat was sighted from three miles away.\n\nIt was bombed while the conning tower\n\nwas still five feet above the surface of\n\nthe water, and bombs fell directly ahead\n\nof the conning tower. A fourth U-boat\n\nwas attacked two days later by a plane\n\nwhich scored two direct hits.

Re-\n\nports indicate that 130 soldiers and 968\n\ninternees were lost.\n\nA savage fight for life and a ruthless\n\ndisregard for the safety of others is the\n\ntheme of terrible stories by survivors.\n\nMany of them shoeless, coatless. Injured\n\nand half-starved, they are being cared for\n\nin the Scottish town where they landed.\n\nA torpedo hit the ship at 6 ajn., putting\n\nthe lighting system out of action and\n\nforcing the engine-room staff to scramble\n\nto the deck through inky darkness. The\n\ntorpedo ripped the ship open and she\n\nbegan to settle quickly, sinking in 20\n\nminutes. The terrific explosion started a\n\n¡stampede as the internees sprang from\n\ntheir beds and dashed for the lifeboats.\n\nThe Germans made it clear that nobody\n\nwas to stand in the way of then* rescue.\n\nThey swept aside all oposltlon in a clam-\n\nour for places in the lifeboats, the\n\nlaunching of which was seriously ham-\n\npered. The water was strewn with wreck-\n\nage and bodies.\n\nThe ship was struck without warning.\n\n\"We cursed the U-boat,but the Germans\n\nand Italians cursed more,\" two soldiers\n\n! said. \"They were almost ferocious in their\n\ni denunciation of this type of warfare.\n\nSuch was the scramble that we had no\n\nopportunity of getting into lifeboats.\" The\n\ni conduct of the German prisoners was bit-\n\nterly criticised. \"They were big, hulking\n\nbrutes who tried to sweep the Italians\n\naside and had to be forcibly restrained,\"\n\nthe soldiers said.\n\nOne hundred and thirty British sol-\n\ndiers struggling desperately on the slop-\n\ning decks to control the screaming mob\n\ngave their lives for their prisoners. \"If\n\nall those aboard had been British the\n\nloss of life would have been a mere frac-\n\ntion of what it was,\" said a survivor.\n\nThe skipper (Captain E. W. Moulton)\n\nstood at his post on the bridge amid the j\n\nchaos. At the last minute he gave his\n\nlifejacket to an Italian and dived into\n\nthe water. He was not seen again. Major\n\nBethel, the military commander, handed\n\nbis lifebelt to one of his men and con-\n\ntinued to supervise the lowering of the\n\nboats until he went down with the ship.\n\nSimilar heroism by the soldiers, sailors\n\nand other members of the ship's com-\n\npany relieves the sordid tale of panic and\n\nsavagery among the Italians and Ger-\n\nmans.\n\nA Berlin Complaint,\n\nBERLIN, July 6.-Official comment on\n\nthe Arandora Star sinking is that \"it is\n\noutrageous and shameful that Britain\n\nshould expose helpless internees to the\n\ndangers of war.\"\n\nFrench Ship Lost.\n\nLONDON, July 3.-The German radio,\n\nquoting the French owners, today an-\n\nnounced the loss of the Atlantic liner\n\nChamplain (28,124 tons) through strik-\n\ning a mine off the French coast.\n\nThe Champlain struck a mine laid by\n\nGerman planes off La Palliée on the j\n\nprevious night.
