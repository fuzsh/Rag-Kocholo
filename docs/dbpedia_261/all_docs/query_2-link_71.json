        "text": "Col. David Paschal was riding in a four-Humvee convoy in northern Iraq on Nov. 5, 2007. As commander of the 1st Brigade Combat Team of the 10th Mountain Division, he rode in the second vehicle.\n\nAfter the first three Hummers had passed, an insurgent detonated two 155-mm rounds stacked on top of each other buried by the road. Each was made of steel and weighed about 100 pounds, filled with explosives. Four soldiers in Paschal's personal security detail in the fourth Humvee were killed. They included Staff Sgt. Carletta Davis, 34, a mother of three; Staff Sgt. John Linde, 30; Sgt. Derek Stenroos, 24, and Pfc. Adam Muller, 21.\n\nPaschal and his sergeant major, Corb Elsbury, hurried to put their soldiers into body bags. \"We didn't want their teammates to see them,\" Paschal recalled from his home in Newport News, Va. \"The last thing they needed to see was their comrades' charred bodies.\" The two men had to wait until all the ammunition had cooked off before dealing with the dead.\n\nThis Memorial Day, the tall former Army officer will ride a motorcycle with Rolling Thunder, a nonprofit advocacy group that honors prisoners of war and service members Missing in Action. He'll travel from Fort Eustis, Va., to Washington, D.C. But he'll take time out from the ride to visit Arlington National Cemetery. There, he'll visit Section 60, Site 8722. That's where Linde is buried.\n\n\"I'll give a toast,\" says Paschal, \"for all the soldiers who paid the ultimate sacrifice.\"\n\nAs a reporter for McClatchy newspapers, I was embedded with the 10th Mountain Division in July 2008. Thanks to public affairs officer Capt. Bruce Drake and Paschal, I was able to write the first story about how an Army unit in a war zone dealt with post-traumatic stress disorder among its troops. For the end of the story, I included part of an interview with the colonel when I asked him about the four soldiers lost that day: \"He looked at his boots, then at his big hands, rubbing them together, swallowing and blinking ... The colonel looked up: 'There's not a day goes by that I don't think of them.'\"\n\nVeterans Day, Nov. 11, honors all who have served. Memorial Day, the last Monday in May, is America's Day of the Dead. It honors those who have died in military service.\n\nMemorial Day \"is not Hot Dog Day or Furniture Day,\" says Joe Pena, who fought in the epic battle against the North Vietnamese Army in the Ia Drang Valley in 1965. I met Pena through my longtime friend and colleague Joe Galloway, the author of a book that memorialized that bloody four-day clash written with the late Gen. Hal Moore, who led the 7th Cavalry Regiment during the battle. Their book, We Were Soldiers Once ... and Young became the 2002 film We Were Soldiers featuring Mel Gibson as Moore.\n\nPena's Memorial Day will be busy. He and his wife Rose will help lay a wreath at the courthouse in Port Lavaca, where Pena was police chief after he got out of the service. Then a 21-gun salute and taps at the cemetery. Finally, a U.S. Coast Guard cutter will lay a wreath in the ocean near Port Lavaca. \"We try to remember our brothers who laid down their lives so we can enjoy freedom,\" Pena says. \"It's not a barbecue.\"\n\nRandy Riggins was a major and executive officer of the 37th Engineer Battalion during the Persian Gulf War. Thanks to him, I was able to ride in his Humvee when Coalition forces launched a ground attack on Feb. 24, 1991.\n\nIn the fourth week of January 1991, I met the Arizonan.\n\nBy then tension was as thick as the occasional sandstorms, called \"shamal,\" that lifted the ochre ash airborne around us. Military and civilians alike knew the push into Iraq — the Ground War — was imminent.\n\nSo just after midnight on Feb. 24, we were coasting back to what would be the LOD, line of departure. Stretch, 6-foot-6 from Idaho, was driving the Hummer about 5 mph on a corduroy dirt road when, on the left side of the vehicle, an American soldier emerged from the line of the dark black night. He was wearing a gas mask.\n\nThe three of us grabbed our own masks from our hips and slammed them on, pulling them over our ears. Briefings had warned us that Saddam Hussein planned to gas any troops who crossed his boundary. My sphincter tightened. My mouth was cotton.\n\nThe guard told Riggins to drive a few meters farther where the battalion had assembled. We did, then dismounted. Riggins walked up to the 37th's commander, Lt. Col. Robert Holcombe, and asked what was happening.\n\nOne of his perimeter guards had yelled, \"Gas!\" So the entire unit had donned gas masks.\n\nThe battalion sergeant major was holding up a strip of what looked like litmus paper. He, Holcombe and Riggins shined red-lensed flashlights on the strip.\n\n\"Neutral,\" the sergeant major said.\n\n\"OK,\" said Lt. Col. Holcombe. \"Randy, find a private.\"\n\nThe battalion held 600 soldiers. They had circled around the gas demonstration. Riggins called out a name. A kid who hadn't started shaving stumbled forward. Somehow, he knew the drill.\n\nWith the battalion brass and a doofus civilian watching, the soldier followed counts from Riggins: 1, 2, 3.\n\nHe pulled off his gas mask.\n\nHe breathed. He smiled.\n\nWe all ripped off our own gas masks. Our faces were sweaty. A few soldiers prayed. Nobody could smoke in case Iraqi monitors picked it up.\n\nHolcombe then told us we were attacking into Iraq at 0400 -- 4 a.m., three hours away.\n\nThe relief we'd felt was replaced with universal puckering.\n\nFor some reason, I stepped into the circle of senior leaders. I was older than anybody but generals, taller than anybody but Stretch.\n\n\"You guys know how journalists find a minefield?\" I asked, loudly. Smiles replaced frowns. One of the battalion's crucial missions was to clear mines so allied troops could advance.\n\nWith gas mask back on my hip and red-lensed flashlights pointed at me, I stepped forward. Put both hands over my ears. Started stomping the ground with my Nam jungle boots.\n\nEverybody cracked up.\n\nWe rolled into Iraq a few hours later.\n\nNo casualties in the unit.\n\nI nicknamed my guide \"Riggo,\" which has stuck.\n\nThe war ended Feb. 28.\n\nAs a Green Beret paratrooper, Riggins made 209 jumps. Riggo knew Gary Gordon and Randy Shughart, the two Medal of Honor winners who won the award posthumously for their courage in Somalia, made famous in Black Hawk Down. About Memorial Day, he says: \"It means the sacrifice of people who didn't make it back, their young lives cut short. It's hard to ponder.\" Riggins became one of my closest friends, and I was his best man when he married Naomi in 2005.\n\nHiroshi (Hershey) Miyamura, a Medal of Honor winner from the Korean War whom I profiled in March, lost many fellow POWs as North Koreans marched them 300 brutal miles to a camp.\n\nNow 93 and retired in Gallup, N.M., Hershey believes that that his mission isn't complete. \"There must be some reason I've lived this long,\" he said in an email. He encourages all veterans to share their stories with their families, \"no matter what you may have done in the military. Not everyone is a combat soldier, but we all serve a greater purpose -- to ensure the freedoms we enjoy today.\"\n\nTomorrow, Joe Padula, a former Army journalist, will visit Fort Campbell, Ky. He'll look at memorials to all the dead from his famous unit, the 101st Airborne Division -- World War II, Vietnam, the Gulf War. At the memorial for those killed in action in Afghanistan, he'll stop at the marker for Staff Sgt. James Hunter.\n\nPadula, whose New Jersey accent could qualify him for a role in The Sopranos, was with Hunter at Kandahar when Hunter was blown in half by a Taliban IED on June 18, 2010. \"We were on patrol, when BOOM!\" he recalls. He and Hunter were photographing and filming the troops \"to tell the soldiers' stories and fight by their side. That was Staff Sgt. Hunter. He was the man. He trained our team as if he knew he wasn't going to make it.\"\n\nHunter was the first Army journalist killed in action since 9/11. I learned about him and Padula, 46, now with his own radio show in Clarksville, Tenn., from Bruce Drake. He was the public affairs officer who helped me tell the story of what the 10th Mountain Division was doing to deal with PTSD among its soldiers in Iraq.\n\nOne of my best friends is Quang Pham. He was 11 when he, his mom and sisters fled Saigon a few days before the North Vietnamese took over the south in 1975. We met when I was reporting for a book on the Persian Gulf War by U.S. News & World Report. After he graduated from UCLA, Pham became the first Vietnamese American to go through Marine aviator school. He'd been flying helicopters in Saudi Arabia, Kuwait and Iraq during the war.\n\nIn 1994, he started writing a memoir called A Sense of Duty: My Father, My American Journey. I helped edit it. It was about his dad, a South Vietnamese pilot who moved his family to safety before he was imprisoned by the North Vietnamese for 10 years. In 1993, I stood on the tarmac with Hoa Pham, his father, at Tustin air station in Southern California. The elder Pham had finally been released from re-education camps and made his way to the U.S. His son was landing a big chopper after a Pacific deployment. It was an honor to be there.\n\nToday, Q (my friend's nickname) is chief executive of Espero, a Florida-based pharmaceutical company. I asked him his thoughts about Memorial Day:\n\n\"Those who fell need to know in eternity that our nation's cause was worthy of their sacrifice.\""
