Such an agenda is an extensive intellectual task and I am pleased to see that the editors have adopted a thematic approach, achieving a balance between chronological periods, geographical areas and operational activities. Running throughout this volume, however, is the overall theme of the face of naval battle. The human dimension of naval warfare is essential and rich, but our lack of knowledge of that experience is still a serious gap in our naval history, which is only just beginning to be filled. Understanding the human factor in naval battle is critical for navies if they are to be trusted guardians of national and international interests in war and peace. We must never forget that while navies are highly complex technological organisations, a naval vessel and the weapons system it constitutes (or of which it is a part) is comprised not simply of equipment, but also of the men and women of its ship’s company. Moreover, while the technology of war may change, and tactics and strategy may evolve, the vital human issues are eternal. Qualities such as courage, teamwork and determination to get the job done are as important now as they have ever been.As one of my predecessors once declared, a navy is a ‘creation of nerves as well as steel; united with blood as well as rivets’. v\n\nNaval Battle - TEXT PAGES 3/4/03 2:05 PM Page vi\n\nvi\n\n|\n\nTHE FACE OF NAVAL BATTLE\n\nIt is this human element, this very real combination of nerves and blood, which has been indispensable in giving Australia’s Navy such a proud tradition. Indeed, the period covered by this book coincides almost exactly with the life of our national naval force. It is important that we ponder the lessons of our history, that we record and discuss the hard-won knowledge and wisdom for which our predecessors, those who experienced at first hand ‘the face of naval battle’, paid such a high price. A better understanding of our history can help us prepare for the future, by assisting us better to ready our people for the undoubted shock of going into battle for the first time.The wisdom residing in the past has been paid for, by our own people and others, and we cannot afford to throw it away. Naval leaders can be caricatured, sometimes justifiably, as technocrats in uniform, and they can easily become absorbed with the technical dimensions of navies at the expense of the human. Despite this, successful navies and great admirals have always understood the human factor.Admiral Cunningham’s famous observation before the evacuation of Crete in which Australian ships were to play a distinguished role—that it would take three years to rebuild a lost f leet but 300 years to rebuild a tradition, and that therefore the Navy could not let the Army down—was above all a statement of values and attitudes and hence an appeal to the human factor. Navies today talk much about how people are their most important resource, but it is too often the case that the human factor has been considered only after the matériel. Notwithstanding recent improvements I am fully aware of the difficulties we still face in attracting and retaining enough young men and women for the future force. I firmly believe that a proper understanding of the sacrifice and service of those who have gone before can help us in this ongoing task. It is the Navy’s people who have made our history, and we have ample past experience and achievement on which to ref lect and draw for inspiration. There are many stirring stories in the following pages, as well as analyses aimed at better understanding the face of naval battle. In order for us to pursue our professional calling we must appreciate how and why our people and others performed these heroic deeds. Part of that understanding is an awareness of what is unique in naval warfare as well as those aspects that are part of the nature of warfare as a whole.Those of us now serving must remember and learn from these lessons as we promote and pursue the Navy’s vital role in our future national security.

Just as human beings have used the seas and oceans they have fought upon them. Two-and-a-half millennia ago, at Salamis, 1500 war galleys—Greek and Persian—closed in mortal combat to decide the future of Greek civilisation. In 1588, in the English Channel, English galleons and a Spanish Armada fought ferocious gun duels to decide whether the Spanish superpower would rule over northern Europe. In 1805, off Cape Trafalgar, Nelson’s ships ruthlessly crushed the combined f leet of France and Spain: the strategic seeds of Napoleon’s defeat were sown. In 1944, at Leyte Gulf, the grey steel machines of modern naval warfare sliced through the waters of the Philippines to eliminate the Japanese f leet as an obstacle to American hegemony in the Pacific. We know these events as historic milestones and remember the names of the great naval captains: Themistocles, Drake, Nelson and Halsey.We know of the ships in and with which they fought, and can summon up their silhouettes to the mind’s eye. But what do we know of the sailors and their commanders who sweated, fought, bled, suffered and died in these human catastrophes? We know little, and we ought to know more. Essentially ordinary people, caught up in the harrowing experience of war, their story is one of the great epics of human history. It holds lessons, moreover, of inestimable value for navies today: those military forces which venture upon the sea, praying for peace but preparing for war.\n\nTHE HUMAN FACTOR People have always mattered most in the outcome of naval warfare. In the words of Wayne Hughes, today’s best-known writer on naval tactics: ‘Leadership, morale, training, physical and mental conditioning, willpower, and endurance are the most important elements in warfare’.6 In the age of the sailing warship, the Royal Navy could go into battle with inferior (and fewer) vessels but superior men—and win. In 1916 however, at Jutland, despite its material superiority this elite force contained defects of organisation and training which impacted upon its performance. During the Second World War, when its equipment could be inferior, it had leaders of f lair and imagination, aggressive and willing to innovate in areas such as night-fighting, and redeemed its reputation.7 Nathan Miller, in a long and learned study of the Second World War at sea, concludes that it was not critical mass which gave victory to the Allied navies, but rather the quality of their leadership in the face of adversity.8 Naval weapons systems have always depended upon the interface between people and material. Each\n\nNaval Battle - TEXT PAGES 3/4/03 2:05 PM Page 5\n\nSETTING THE SCENE\n\n|\n\n5\n\ncan enhance or detract from the effectiveness of the other, but the best equipment is still unlikely to compensate for poor personal performance. Navies down the generations have understood the human factor by tradition, rather than by precept or concept, and this is probably the wisest course. Human beings are habitual creatures, responding more to perceived realities and regular practicalities than to abstractions, no matter how profound.Traditions can be powerfully effective, therefore, especially successful ones. Lee Cordner, an Australian frigate captain in the Gulf War, has written of how history inspired (and warned) him during the demanding task of maintaining effectiveness in a war zone.9 But traditions must be retrieved, understood, preserved, nurtured and propagated to continue the habits of success, especially in such a demanding area as military operations at sea. Past experience, moreover, has been dearly bought. In the words of a Falklands veteran, speaking about the naval aviators of the previous twenty years:‘it’s on the blood, sweat and tears of those people that our expertise . . . was built. It only came from a lot of work, hard f lying and, sadly, a lot of casualties’.10 This book, therefore, has a twofold aim. It seeks to explore a critical dimension in the history of naval warfare, as well as a remarkable strand of human experience. It also seeks a better understanding of that experience for a practical purpose. Given the difficulty of simulating real war, historical lessons are priceless. Naval thought and policy, strategy, tactics and technology are nothing without the human factor, and navies must learn from history how to nurture it—for the sake of their people as well as of their professional success.\n\nTHE ‘FACE OF BATTLE’ HISTORICAL GENRE The phrase ‘the face of battle’ was employed by Sir John Keegan a generation ago, as the title of a distinguished book in which he explored the varied facets of personal experience in the midst of combat on land.11 Many subsequent writers on war have been haunted by Keegan’s memorable opening sentence: ‘I have not been in a battle . . . ’, and by his interim conclusion: ‘I grow increasingly convinced that I have very little idea of what a battle can be like’.12 Can the experience of battle be imagined, or communicated to those who have not had it? There are differing views.13 One veteran has told me of his belief that, with care, it can be imagined. Another maintains that it is impossible to communicate the terror of having another human being approach with the intention of killing you.There is a credible consensus among many that\n\nNaval Battle - TEXT PAGES 3/4/03 2:05 PM Page 6\n\n6\n\n|\n\nTHE FACE OF NAVAL BATTLE\n\nbattle experience can only be known, in truth and reality, by having had it.14 To think otherwise is arguably to demean a frequently intense and always uniquely personal experience, as well as to make light of formidable intellectual difficulties. Historically, however, all is not lost. We can travel a considerable distance by listening closely to those who have seen battle and by imaginatively reconstructing events from eyewitness accounts. Indirect experience indeed has a certain value, as Liddell Hart observed, in terms of its variety and extent.15 There is a growing and impressive literature, largely stimulated by Keegan’s work, on the human experience of warfare on land.16 With certain exceptions there has not been, however, a similar genre of writing about naval war. As Paul Kennedy has pointed out, ‘writings upon “the face of battle” have found little echo in its naval dimensions’.17 Why this should be is at first mysterious. Sea power has been, and remains, a major strategic factor in the shaping of the modern world. English-speaking societies in particular are the products of a great global maritime diaspora. Naval operations combine the inherent adventure of seafaring with the drama of war.The popularity of the novels of C.S. Forester and Patrick O’Brian testifies to the vast public interest in this combination of great themes. The audience is there, but can the story be readily told? There are obstacles to recovering the personal experience of warfare in general. Operational security is essential and can be mandated long after the events concerned. Governments preserve support for military operations by sparing their peoples the horrors of truly vivid reportage. Veterans are often reluctant to speak, at least until late in life, of what they have seen, done, thought and felt, through a natural desire to expunge often traumatic memories. The public commemoration of war is thus inherently unreal in terms of battle experience. As Sir Max Hastings wrote of an American serviceman killed in Vietnam: ‘The more remote this man became from the battlefield, from reality, the more honoured would be his carcass’.18 This is not to deny that commemoration is powerfully invested with meaning, for veterans as well as others, but it is not in itself the meaning and reality of battle. Finally, there is the difficulty of reconstructing after the event the often kaleidoscopic impressions of action and reaction, of sight, sound and smell, and of life-threatening emergency, all filtered through the lens of personal observation and frequently coloured by the effects of shock, injury and exhaustion—all this in an atmosphere which frequently plays tricks with the human sense of time. In addition, personal battle accounts are generally written after the fact, and are subject, to a greater\n\nNaval Battle - TEXT PAGES 3/4/03 2:05 PM Page 7\n\nSETTING THE SCENE\n\n|\n\n7\n\nor lesser extent, to the human inclination to rationalise and logically reorder.19 Neither is the perspective of high command always helpful in glimpsing the face of battle. Admiral Cunningham (who like so many high naval commanders risked the perils of combat) said with candour as well as modesty:‘the best seats in any war are high up and at the back’, presumably meaning they are safer and afford a view of the bigger picture.20 But this kind of relative safety and strategic appreciation are not the same as the immediate reality of war.\n\nTHE FACE OF NAVAL BATTLE: THE VEIL OF INVISIBILITY A further difficulty is apparent when we consider more closely the specifically naval dimension of warfare. History contrives to draw a veil of invisibility over the face of naval battle. Why is this so? It derives essentially from three factors: the nature of the events, the nature of those involved and the nature of what remains afterwards.Turning first to the events, in his keynote address to the King-Hall Naval History Conference in 2001, David Rosenberg pointed out how naval combat is tactically rapid.21 Its action can be very f leeting and, even in the age of modern sensors, highly unexpected. It can be over, literally, in a f lash, leaving less of an actual event to create an impression on human memory. Historically there have usually been relatively few witnesses to naval battle in comparison to land warfare. Many of these witnesses, moreover, have been killed in action or by the perils of the sea. One reason for the paucity of testimony to naval defeat and loss is that ships can sink rapidly and with very few survivors. One hundred per cent losses of the crews of downed submarines and aircraft are not uncommon. Non-combatant witnesses are very few or totally absent. Merchant crews caught up in maritime war (a de facto paramilitary force) have often been lost with their ships and, unlike those on land, naval actions are not usually observed by local populations. Journalists are rarely present to report naval battles. Even in the Falklands, with accredited journalists in theatre and action in proximity to the shore, there was no direct reporting of the battle in Falkland Sound involving the loss of HMS Ardent. A Royal Naval surgeon wrote of the survivors: What these boys had done was place themselves between a well handled and hostile air force and our soldiers, who were trying to land on the shore. I think some of the ship’s company were slightly anxious that there was no one around to recognize just what they had achieved.\n\nNaval Battle - TEXT PAGES 3/4/03 2:05 PM Page 8\n\n8\n\n|\n\nTHE FACE OF NAVAL BATTLE\n\nImage Not Available\n\nAll the journalists were ashore with the Brigade commander and had missed all this.22\n\nHere is an instance (convoy escort being another, and the evacuation of defeated armies yet another) of something navies frequently do, which is save lives rather than kill or destroy. In such situations naval forces are often highly professional, and their conduct highly honourable, but they lack the glamour of having ‘accounted’ for the enemy—not always their operational purpose. What of the people involved in naval battle? A sailor’s way of life and way of war are different from those of a soldier and distinct from the life of a civilian. Seafaring is a technical skill, with something of a separate language of its own. Sailors have traditionally lived in somewhat segregated coastal communities and, beyond these, on the seas and as transients in foreign lands; in other words, they dwell on the fringes of their domestic societies.They have not always gone to war in the same massed and demonstrable way as soldiers, nor have they always reentered society in similar fashion. Theirs is but a partially visible and\n\nNaval Battle - TEXT PAGES 3/4/03 2:05 PM Page 9\n\nSETTING THE SCENE\n\n|\n\n9\n\nsomewhat distinct sub-community and society is conditioned to their regular absence. Unsurprisingly, their stories of war penetrate society less readily. Naval officers are—to a great extent and increasingly—technocrats, with their professional standing resting upon arcane and often secret knowledge.They are not, in this sense,‘user-friendly’ as sources of contemporary history. As Peter Stanley observes, sailors are not generally literary people, inclined to publish their stories, although there are exceptions.23 Life at sea is not conducive to such activity. Modesty, taciturnity and discretion (hallmarks of ‘the silent service’) have traditionally been held up as naval virtues, and navies have frequently shunned publicity. The Royal Navy, for example, has had an historical tendency to dislike the press and at least one great admiral (Cunningham) was residually hostile to it.24 An officer such as Mountbatten was unusual in seeking publicity for the Royal Navy during the Second World War.25 Sailors and navies, in short, have for a variety of reasons not promoted their tales of the face of naval battle. And what remains of naval battle after the event? Ships are sunk and those that survive, with few exceptions, are eventually sold off or scrapped. There are no walkable battlefields as such, and historical reconstructions are impractical on any scale.26 Fewer visual images, such as photographs, remain of naval action (sailors are usually intensely occupied on a warship in battle), and few of those images we do have are of people. Submarines, indeed, usually have only a periscope view through which to photograph the battlespace. Sailors do not have the same access as soldiers to retrievable battle souvenirs. The personal effects and weaponry of their defeated enemies usually sink beneath the sea. Souvenirs are classic vehicles for human stories. (One thoughtful ship’s captain in the Falklands engaged a war correspondent to collect pistols and bayonets for distribution among his crew:‘Every soldier and marine on the islands is busy collecting souvenirs. I’ve got several hundred men on this ship who’ve done just as much towards winning the war, but can’t go ashore.’27) Ships successful in battle return home, and while their crews are often dispersed by transfer and replacement, or retire, the ships themselves become objects of technical fascination. Naval officers, historians and architects, procurement specialists and the naval equivalents of train-spotting techno-buffs study the vessels themselves, too often without reference to those who live and work in them. As David Rosenberg has observed, that great and indispensable work of reference Jane’s Fighting Ships is a record of things and not people.28 Even in the aftermath, the veil of invisibility obscures the face of naval battle.\n\nNaval Battle - TEXT PAGES 3/4/03 2:05 PM Page 10\n\n10\n\n|\n\nTHE FACE OF NAVAL BATTLE\n\nLOOKING BEHIND THE VEIL Can we peer behind the veil? There have recently been encouraging signs.The latest contribution in the slender series of writings exploring the face of naval battle is by Ronald Spector. His book At War at Sea is a highly successful investigation of ‘the complex relationship between naval technology, operations, and human factors’.29 With contextual sophistication and meticulous scholarship, Spector pursues this theme on a global scale. He concludes that the human factor is supreme in terms of skill in utilising existing (rather than the most advanced) naval technology. The amount of personal testimony which Spector has identified and deployed suggests one of the advantages enjoyed by twentiethcentury naval historians: their period is marked by high levels of literacy among sailors, relative to earlier times. The essays collected herein further attest to the sources available to those wishing to look behind the veil.This book is intended to assist in the development of a ‘face of naval battle’ historical genre. While international in scope it is also unique in bringing Australian material into play. Such material combines the continuity and traditions of a predominantly surface warship navy with the experiences of a smaller naval power ultimately rooted in the Asia-Pacific region. Andrew Gordon observes that naval warfare is best understood in terms of the continuum of naval operations.30 This book involves the working assumption that the human experience of war at sea, while punctuated by intense episodes of battle per se, is also best understood as part of that operational continuum.The book spans the chronological period encompassing the industrial and post-industrial eras: from the coming of modern battleships and weaponry in the late nineteenth century to the contemporary world of the information and technological revolution. It aims to provide a balance of operational themes and to draw case studies from a variety of nations. Above all, its subject is people and the maritime military setting in which they have lived and died.\n\nTHE BACKGROUND AND LEGACY OF THE AGE OF SAIL The great age of the sailing warship, culminating in Britain’s naval supremacy in the early nineteenth century, is in many ways a vanished world. Its operational modes and way of battle have largely been consigned to history. When remembered, however, it throws the nature\n\nNaval Battle - TEXT PAGES 3/4/03 2:05 PM Page 11\n\nSETTING THE SCENE\n\n|\n\n11\n\nof modern naval warfare into clearer relief. It has also left a legacy with important continuities into the modern age. Naval warfare under sail took place in what Nicholas Rodger has termed ‘the wooden world’.31 This world saw an eternal interaction of human beings with superbly crafted timber vessels.The resulting combination was one of military history’s most effective weapons systems. As British line-of-battle ships closed to engage the enemy, their preparations ref lected the interaction of timber and f lesh.32 Carpenters as well as surgeons set up their stations. The decks, vulnerable to fire, were sluiced with water and sprinkled with sand—the latter to give grip to bare feet, not least when the decks ran with blood. Magazines were secured against explosion and fire. Splinter netting was erected and loose timber cleared, for there was mortal danger to sailors from a hail of wooden splinters struck off by solid shot.With battle joined, the atmosphere in the gun decks was one of hellish confusion, even in a f leet which emerged victorious. According to a Royal Marine officer at Trafalgar, the atmosphere in the middle of three decks ‘beggars all description: it bewilders the senses of sight and hearing . . . the guns recoiling with violence, reports louder than thunder’.33 Other accounts paint the same picture of noise, smoke, confusion and terror. There being no system of triage, the wounded received treatment in the order they were brought to the surgeon. Rum might be issued to sailors after an action (the dangers of giving alcohol to men in shock being not then fully appreciated), but the immediate necessity was to repair and work the ship and deal with any changing weather conditions.34 How did this experience change in the 150 years from Trafalgar in 1805 to the Second World War and beyond? Fleet actions and ship-toship combat in the age of sail were set differently in place and time from more modern naval engagements. Sailing ship battles could only take place in fair weather and, like the early twentieth-century gun actions at Tsushima and Jutland, were usually one-day affairs. Damage to ships and men could often hardly be sustained beyond a matter of hours. Nelson himself said that Trafalgar was too warm work to last long.35 Admittedly, this could be the case in modern engagements. Night fighting under sail, however, was technically dangerous and practised only on rare occasions, such as at the Nile in 1798.Tactically it was only facilitated well into the twentieth century by the coming of radar. Significantly, the arrival of strike air power—at and over the sea—meant that naval engagements were longer and their strain more sustained.36 Sailing battles were fought in very close proximity, but modern, long-range guns, locomotive torpedoes and aircraft have made naval combat distant\n\nNaval Battle - TEXT PAGES 3/4/03 2:05 PM Page 12\n\n12\n\n|\n\nTHE FACE OF NAVAL BATTLE\n\nImage Not Available\n\nand impersonal. Hand-to-hand-fighting has become a thing of the past.37 Industrial age weaponry had a new destructive effect, even against industrial age vessels, which was different in kind and degree from what had gone before. It is credibly argued that sailing ship gunnery at the height of the Nelsonian era was essentially personnel-killing in its effect.38 Wooden warships were difficult to sink by gunfire, although on occasion they could burn and explode (like the French L’Orient at the Nile). As Nicholas Tracy has observed, ‘Nelson’s tactics always emphasised the importance of using overwhelming concentration of power to destroy enemy morale and gun-deck organisation’.39 While the fact remains that a sailing ship’s morale was not readily broken by gunfire, it was physical damage and significant loss of life, rather than wholesale destruction of the platform, which usually disabled the ship as a weapons system. Twentieth-century weaponry enabled tactics which were primarily platform-killing through destruction and sinking. As a consequence, while human beings were not the major target, they could\n\nNaval Battle - TEXT PAGES 3/4/03 2:05 PM Page 13\n\nSETTING THE SCENE\n\n|\n\n13\n\nbecome casualties in new orders of magnitude, even when we allow for more sailors manning bigger ships. Bismarck’s destruction of HMS Hood in 1941, with just three survivors out of 1419 men,40 is an extreme but not isolated example. Ronald Spector writes of ‘a special horror in the kind of instantaneous mass death’ which naval battle could now produce.41 This would appear to be the major reason for the decline of surrender in modern naval warfare. Such niceties were essentially alien to the desire for total destruction at a distance. General conditions of sea service had improved significantly by the beginning of the twentieth century and continued to do so over the next hundred years, even—as Guy Griffiths observes—between the 1940s and the 1960s.42 Harsh corporal punishments, poor nutrition and primitive medical care were progressively eclipsed by social and democratic progress and better scientific knowledge. But while the sea remained an inherently dangerous place in the face of the elements and the enemy, there was one way in which it was more so by 1945. More sophisticated naval technology did not necessarily mean greater safety. The munitions, machinery and fuel which were part and parcel of modern warships increased the threat of deadly accidents in an unforgiving metallic world. More than 200 USN sailors died in just three such incidents in the late 1960s.43 Changes in the face of naval battle, largely driven by new technology, had thus created an even more destructive and dangerous environment at sea by the mid-twentieth century. The age of sail, however, has left its legacy. Key elements of the experience of naval warfare have hardly changed since the days of Nelson, even in the era of missile warfare. Leadership at various levels, including the sharing of risks by commanders, has remained essential to victory at sea in terms both of competence and effect on morale. Nelson was famous for the inspirational effect of his presence within a ship or a f leet. A seaman who fought at Trafalgar ref lected:‘in fighting under him, every man thought himself sure of success’.44 Great naval leaders of the 1940s such as Cunningham and the Australian Hec Waller, who made his name as a destroyer commander in the Mediterranean, were fighting sailors who led from the front, had a rapport with the men under them and communicated their confidence.45 Beyond f leet and unit command, lower-level leadership has also been vital for operational success, as it was on the gun decks in the age of sail. Ronald Spector sees this as the critical leadership link in twentieth-century naval warfare.46 Human response to leadership is a component of human reaction to danger. In the potentially lethal environment of a modern warship in\n\nNaval Battle - TEXT PAGES 3/4/03 2:05 PM Page 14\n\n14\n\n|\n\nTHE FACE OF NAVAL BATTLE\n\nbattle, often marked—as in earlier times—by material and human destruction, the same essential factors have kept sailors working their ships and operating their weapons: confidence in their leaders, small group dynamics, training and tradition, the discipline of having to perform tasks, the lack of a place of retreat and sheer physical courage. For such reasons the warship’s morale is still relatively immune to enemy fire. The more protracted tasks of convoy escort, blockade and the exercise of sea control are still, as under sail, complex, demanding and arduous. Finally, there is the sea itself, liable to induce sickness and always demanding respect for its ability to act with violence. Even in the moment of victory, in the hour of his death, the prospect of a gale was high in Nelson’s thoughts.47 In such ways the face of naval battle has remained unaltered by time.\n\nSURFACE WARSHIP WARRIORS The crews of modern surface warships, descendants of the tars who manned the sailing line of battle ships, have never ceased to be at the sharp end of naval warfare.48 What have been the salient features of their experience of naval battle? As twentieth-century warships, seeking battle, approached for action, rising anticipation among their crews accompanied efforts to locate the enemy. The spectacle of f leets in movement could be memorable. Guy Griffiths, remembering the Bismarck chase, recalls it as an inspiring sight.49 In the era before radar it was sharp-eyed lookouts who established contact.50 Ref lective men had, by this time, pondered their mortality and sought to come to terms with their lives, as Peter Overlack tells us Von Spee did before the Battle of Coronel.51 Immediately before action, from Jutland in 1916 to the Falklands in 1982, there was palpable tension, deep fear and general attempts by men to mask the appearance of being afraid.52 Admiral Sir John ‘Sandy’Woodward wrote how each man has a different way of dealing with fear.53 The expectation of probably being hit—as for the crew of Ardent, sent into Falkland Sound to draw fire—was terrifying.54 For many sailors action was an unknown quantity as they awaited their baptism of fire. Aboard a warship in action there are two worlds: above and below the deck. Each has its particular dangers and terrors.The visibility of air attacks to US sailors at Guadalcanal increased their sense of vulnerability.55 Conversely, below the deck, it could be stressful being unable to see the action or know what was going on.This was the case in the Falklands as it had been, as Bruce Elleman observes, almost a century earlier.56\n\nNaval Battle - TEXT PAGES 3/4/03 2:05 PM Page 15\n\nSETTING THE SCENE\n\n|\n\n15\n\nWhile men on the upperworks of a ship in action were directly exposed to enemy fire, those below decks and in the engine room could also suffer its effects in frightful ways—explosions in confined spaces, smoke, soaring temperatures and incoming water.57 Engine-room spaces in a modern surface combatant can straddle the water line and be hit by missile or torpedo.58 The noise of a naval action during the Second World War, when heard below decks, could be colossal and a cause of nervous breakdown. As Gordon Johnson recalls:‘There was the screaming whine of the ship’s turbines, the blast of our guns, and Japanese bombs exploding, the latter like having your head in a 44 gallon drum while someone hits it with a sledgehammer’.59 Physically detached from the enemy, however, sailors in action have usually continued to work the ship. Such work is an antidote to panic and helps denial that the worst will happen.60 Indeed, not having a job in a ship, for example, as a rescued survivor of another, can induce a sense of helplessness.61 There have been remarkable examples of coolness aboard warships in action. A Royal Naval pilot above Falkland Sound spoke to the operations room of a ship below:‘I said:“What do you mean, wait?” He said:“Well, we’ve just had our ops room strafed with gunfire, with 30mm cannon.The man across the desk from me has lost the top of his head and I’ve been hit in the arm and I’m just collecting myself.” ’.62 Commitment to the task in hand has largely derived from the realisation that it is a matter of ‘kill or be killed’.63 There can also be a fatalism about death, an acceptance that it may come regardless, which frees the mind for the job. ‘You just become fatalistic. If a bullet’s got your name on it, that’s it.’64 Water is a better conductor of physical shock than air.65 It is the combination of heavy artillery, bombs, torpedoes and missiles with such explosive potential which has made war at sea so awesomely destructive within the confined areas in which sailors serve. While some such as Vice Admiral Sir John Collins could be nostalgic for the old surface gun actions, for the era before submarines and aircraft threatened warships, the decks and spaces of the ships at Tsushima and Jutland could still become killing zones.66 As Michael Dowsett relates, the sight of the Emden in 1914 was a shocking example of the state of a defeated ship in a gun action.67\n\nATTACK FROM THE AIR The advent of massed air attacks at sea, sustainable for days, created environments on surface ships which were hellish in their lethality and\n\nNaval Battle - TEXT PAGES 3/4/03 2:05 PM Page 16\n\n16\n\n|\n\nTHE FACE OF NAVAL BATTLE\n\npsychological pressure.There was no safe place, for example, on a target carrier in the Pacific War.68 The British carrier HMS Illustrious, caught by three dozen Stukas off Italy in 1941, was a picture of what large warships could suffer before the development of carrier task groups which could deal with land-based air forces.69 There was noise, damage and destruction (both human and material), f looding and fire, burning fuel and exploding ammunition.The devastating effect of projectiles in enclosed spaces was an echo of the age of sail. Everywhere the metal of the ship was hot, with the engineering spaces reaching 140° Fahrenheit.70 The ship survived. A comparable fate befell HMS Ardent in the Falklands: bombed and engulfed in fire and smoke. A Royal Naval surgeon watched from a helicopter:‘It’s a sight I shall never forget.The fires of hell were burning in that ship’.71 The ship was lost. The evacuation of Crete in 1941 is probably the most dramatic case study of the effects of maritime strike against ships lacking air cover and adequate air defence. Cunningham’s f leet suffered terrible losses while evacuating Allied personnel. One sailor became a casualty for every eight troops evacuated, 90 per cent of the naval casualties being deaths.Three cruisers and six destroyers were sunk, and two battleships, an aircraft\n\nImage Not Available\n\nNaval Battle - TEXT PAGES 3/4/03 2:05 PM Page 17\n\nSETTING THE SCENE\n\n|\n\n17\n\ncarrier, two cruisers and two destroyers badly damaged.72 The cruiser HMS Orion, which survived, had a bomb pass through her bridge and explode in the 4-inch magazine, causing 500 casualties among sailors and soldiers.The air attacks on the Mediterranean Fleet could be truly terrifying. While the first experience for a sailor could be shocking, second and subsequent episodes were dreaded in advance.The cumulative effect on an individual could be nervous exhaustion or breakdown. Simultaneously there could be extraordinary examples of gallantry. During the Crete evacuation, an Australian seaman, Ian Rhodes, carried on firing at a Stuka and shot it down as his ship HMS Kashmir sank.73 A further version of the terror of the air threat appeared in the form of the kamikaze in the Pacific War. According to an American sailor, the destroyer battle stations at Okinawa were ‘as close to Hell as a man could get in this world’.74 A later variation came in the shape of the anti-ship missile. Few individuals have witnessed a missile fired in anger approaching a ship. A Royal Naval officer in the Falklands found the experience mesmerising: They don’t shoot Exocets at you in training . . . You don’t actually see them coming head-on . . . I was transfixed by the missile coming at us . . . It was a sense of awesome power coming towards you . . . quite incredible. For ages afterwards I closed my eyes and that’s all I could see, that sort of imprint on my mind.75\n\nThe missile, fired at the short range of twelve miles and travelling at 680 miles per hour, took a minute to reach the picket destroyer HMS Sheffield, which had shut down its electronic support measures—and hence part of its missile radar detection capability—to transmit communications by satellite.The only detection was visual, at less than a mile, with no time to fire decoys. The missile approached by the starboard bow and struck amidships without exploding. The impact ignited the missile’s fuel, triggering an intense fire which caused dozens of casualties and the abandonment of the ship, which sank several days later.76\n\nATTACK FROM BENEATH THE SEA As well as the drama of gun actions and the shocks of air attack, there was the protracted threat posed by submarines for escort crews and particularly for merchant seamen. Here was a whole dimension of naval battle which during the Second World War, for months and years, eroded and tested the endurance of surface sailors. Many merchant officers detested\n\nNaval Battle - TEXT PAGES 3/4/03 2:05 PM Page 18\n\n18\n\n|\n\nTHE FACE OF NAVAL BATTLE\n\nthe physical strain of watch-keeping and convoy station-keeping.77 This was combined with the anticipation of the unseen arrival of a U-boat wolf-pack, likely to attack at night and create a random wave of explosions, fires and sinkings. Escort and merchant crews were often expected to undertake a return voyage and relive the experience within a matter of days or weeks.There is no mystery in the inclination of naval personnel to relieve the stress with high living in ports such as Derry.78 The most famous British submarine-killer of the War, Captain F.J. Walker, died in 1944 of ‘overstrain, overwork and war weariness’.79 Frank Layard, as Michael Whitby’s human portrait shows, was in the same tradition. His willpower as an escort commander in the face of his own anxiety, stress and middle age was a sustained act of courage which symbolised the commitment of a generation to duty and the victory of their cause.80 The courage of merchant seamen, whose ships were the prime target of submarine warfare, was one of the human phenomena of the War. British Merchant Naval morale held up in the face of a higher proportional casualty rate than in any of the uniformed services. Merchant seamen received 6000 awards for gallantry.81 Herein lies one illustration of the significance of the George Cross and George Medal as recognition for gallantry.82\n\nJOINT OPERATIONS All naval warfare is in a true sense ‘joint’, given the fundamental nature of the land–sea interface and its reinforcement by the coming of air power. But amphibious or joint operations in the more particular sense have a history as old as sea power.While the conduct of such operations has become more professional over time, modern historical experience has found them to be various, complex, difficult and often highly dangerous to all involved. At one end of the operational spectrum, sailors have been at the lethal end of power projection against the land. The first Australian servicemen to die in action in the First World War were sailors, killed in the attack on the wireless station at Rabaul in 1914.83 At the other end of the spectrum, navies have evacuated armies from land to sea.To evacuate a defeated land force under fire is surely one of the most difficult operations conceivable for a navy. Crete, as already mentioned, is a case in point. At Dunkirk the task was facilitated by the transfer of moral authority from ship to shore. Naval officers organised the beaches in the face of loss of cohesion and discipline among the troops. Neither destroyer crews nor\n\nNaval Battle - TEXT PAGES 3/4/03 2:05 PM Page 19\n\nSETTING THE SCENE\n\n|\n\n19\n\nsoldiers, however, were practised at the work involved and initial progress was slow. German air and S-boat attacks caused ships, sailors and troops to be lost, but the operation turned into a remarkable success.84 Such joint operations required luck, mainly in relation to the weather. The ‘miracle’ of Dunkirk was the calm weather and water, together with helpful cloud cover.85 Similar luck attended the British in the Falklands, with thick mist covering their main landing at San Carlos.86 It was also human factors such as leadership, experience and specialist knowledge which brought success in such complex enterprises.Vice Admiral Bertram Ramsay’s achievements at Dunkirk and on the naval side of the Normandy landings were based on his people skills, f lexibility, improvisation and moral courage.87 John Collins recalled the way in which the Allied landings in the South West Pacific created a pattern, one clearly honed by experience.88 Specialist knowledge was invaluable in the Falklands, for example, when a Royal Marine officer, Ewen Southby-Tailyour, could share his expert knowledge of the coastline with planners and guide in the main landing force.89 The cultural gap between military services, in terms of language and procedures, has been one of the hazards of joint operations.90 This underlines Russell Parkin’s point that such operations require specialist and cooperative training.91 Such training should be predicated on the awareness that all involved are literally in the same boat. Historically this awareness has been too rare, coming in extremis and out of the experience of being under fire.‘Thank God we’ve got a Navy’ said a British soldier to a sailor at Dunkirk.92 A wounded Australian digger taken out of Tobruk aboard the destroyer Vendetta used similar words:‘Thank God for the Navy’.93\n\nWORKING A SHIP Working a ship at sea is a continuous task whether in action or not. Maintaining and sailing a warship has always required high levels of efficiency and commitment from its crew. As industrial age vessels and weapons evolved, sailors increasingly became skilled tradesmen who could not perform their tasks mindlessly. Boredom and fatigue are perennial pitfalls of life at sea. During the Pacific War (and other operations in the Asia-Pacific region) these dangers were compounded by heat and the travelling of vast distances. Such factors not only made the technical tasks of naval seamanship more difficult, but could be a threat to physical safety and military security and had to be guarded against.94 Living conditions aboard ship gradually improved, but on smaller ships\n\nNaval Battle - TEXT PAGES 3/4/03 2:05 PM Page 20\n\n20\n\n|\n\nTHE FACE OF NAVAL BATTLE\n\nduring the early twentieth century they could be hellish.The Flower class corvettes, made famous in the Battle of the Atlantic, lacked space, ventilation, adequate sanitation and protection from the elements.95 Over the last generation, soldiers have often been impressed by the quality of life af loat.The war correspondent Sir Max Hastings visited British ships in the Falklands: Throughout the war, it was always an odd experience to pass from the primitive, muddy bivouacs of the men ashore into a warship cabin, decorated with books and family photographs, [and] tiny personal comforts . . .96\n\nSuch relative comfort, however, was no protection from the reality of war. One Royal Naval officer, having been evacuated from HMS Sheffield after the missile strike, was in the wardroom shower aboard another ship when the air raid warning sounded.97 Whatever the level or lack of danger or discomfort, ships have personalities essentially created by their captains and crews. Cunningham appreciated a very positive spirit aboard the light cruiser HMAS Sydney during the war in the Mediterranean.98 A satisfactory living and working atmosphere aboard a warship derives ultimately from the mutual respect which is generated by performance of skilled and interdependent tasks.\n\nSUNKEN SHIPS, LOST SAILORS AND SURVIVORS Three likely fates generally befell ships sunk during the Second World War and their crews. A vessel might be destroyed instantaneously, with almost no chance of survival. As we have seen, the battlecruiser Hood, sunk by Bismarck, had virtually no survivors. Fatal damage might swiftly sink a ship but allow a significant survival rate. British destroyers bombed in the Mediterranean could sink in two minutes, or even less, although half the crew could survive. Otherwise a ship might sink relatively slowly, allowing what was usually an orderly abandonment such as Guy Griffiths recalls of HMS Repulse, sunk by Japanese aircraft off Malaya.99 Meredith Dewey, a naval chaplain aboard the British cruiser HMS Effingham, related the very orderly and good-humoured abandonment of the ship off Norway in 1940. He had time to pack his suitcase, retrieve comforts for the troops and save the ship’s communion plate.100 The maritime tradition was that the captain went down with a sinking ship, although how many did so by accident or design is\n\nNaval Battle - TEXT PAGES 3/4/03 2:05 PM Page 21\n\nSETTING THE SCENE\n\n|\n\n21\n\nunclear.101 We can assume that many captains were lost immediately due to destruction of ships’ bridges or swift sinkings. Others surely went down unintentionally: still fighting, trying to save the ship, or waiting for others to get off. Others were warriors willing to share the fate of their command. Hec Waller, lost aboard the cruiser HMAS Perth while engaging superior Japanese forces in the Sunda Strait in 1942, was probably in this category. Historically, sailors, and especially captains, have bonded with their ships and felt emotional loss when they have been sunk.A warship is a shared home in a hostile environment, a thing of professional pride and a symbol of national power. Few captains have been able to live at ease after losing their ships in action. Having survived a sinking, sailors in the water were exposed to many new dangers.At Jutland, the fate of those f loating could be grim: burns or injury could cause death or hasten drowning; men could be minced in passing ships’ propellers or drowned in their wakes; and shells exploding in the water could kill swimmers.102 Much of the evidence for experiences in life boats or rafts comes from the stories of merchant seamen in the Second World War. The chances of survival in such circumstances were generally good, and morale and cooperation were apparently the critical factors. Bad seas such as those of the North Atlantic were always a threat and could overturn small craft. Death, when it came in boats or rafts, came slowly and could involve mental as well as physical disintegration and collapse.103 Cold and exposure—such as affected Argentinian survivors of the Belgrano sinking in 1982, drifting in sub-Antarctic waters—could still bring on heart failure even when modern survival clothing was worn.104\n\nNAVAL WARRIORS IN NEW DIMENSIONS Submariners Sailors fought in two new dimensions as the twentieth century progressed—first below then above the sea—and the face of naval battle acquired new aspects. Undersea life and warfare had particular and unique elements. Within the confines of submarines, there was of necessity a heightened informality and familiarity. U-boat captain Peter Cremer took care to select men who were natural team players.105 Submarine work required considerable calmness and teamwork.106 Even without the enemy it was a highly dangerous environment. Collective survival depended upon each individual performing every detail of his duty, which created close\n\nNaval Battle - TEXT PAGES 3/4/03 2:05 PM Page 22\n\n22\n\n|\n\nTHE FACE OF NAVAL BATTLE\n\nbonds among the crews of boats. Such bonds were one of the factors which sustained German U-boat morale during the 1940s despite a casualty rate of almost 70 per cent.107 For such reasons, submariners have always considered themselves an elite. Submarine life was and is conditioned by harsh physical facts. Internally, boats are essentially designed as engineering systems, almost completely occupied by weapons and machinery.108 Such cramped quarters are not natural living spaces for human beings. Externally, the ominous weight of the sea itself can f lood or crush the boat with no real prospect of human escape. Submariners recalling the interior of boats remember the smell—always one of the most evocative senses for human memory. Peter Cremer wrote of ‘the characteristic U-boat fug: the stink of diesel oil mixed with cooking smells, the exhalations of fusty clothing and stale air’.109 Men also remembered the exhaustion they felt after actions and extended patrols. Cremer recalled the effects of a transatlantic patrol on the crew of his U-333.There had been lack of sunlight and fresh air, the tiring bridge watch in the wet and cold, the confined work around the diesels and electric motors, lack of oxygen when submerged, the lack of exercise and loss of appetite which occurred despite every culinary art, all this made extreme physical demands. Add to this the interminable depth-charge attacks to which we had been helplessly exposed when submerged, and even the strongest men emerged exhausted.110\n\nIn action submariners were the hunters, seeking to strike before their quarry could scatter and often exalting at their kills. But they could quickly become the hunted, working in the dark of a damaged boat and suffering the enormous tension of being under attack from the surface.111 David Jones relates how in action a boat’s crew had to remain in ignorance of what was happening.112 A submarine could also be engaged in traditional combat on the surface. Peter Cremer remembered the horrors of a duel with a corvette in the Atlantic in 1942. Gun and shellfire riddled his conning tower and he suffered multiple wounds, surviving serious loss of blood and makeshift surgery, performed without anaesthesia by his unqualified chief engineer.113 Lack of onboard medical facilities was a feature of early twentieth-century submarine life.\n\nNaval aviators Naval pilots and aircrew operating in the maritime environment faced a variety of challenges and dangers. Many of these were unique in naval\n\nNaval Battle - TEXT PAGES 3/4/03 2:05 PM Page 23\n\nSETTING THE SCENE\n\n|\n\n23\n\nwarfare, deriving essentially from operating in a platform separate from a ship. Naval aviators could be involved in a variety of types of mission, principally combat air patrols, air combat, maritime strike, land attack, transport and evacuation.They could have the responsibility of defending or attacking capital ships such as carriers, as well as having to deal with the complications of operating over sea, land and enemy territory. They faced a threefold threat from the hazards of f lying, the action of the enemy and the danger of the sea. Naval air warfare put a premium on the human factor in the form of pilots, crews and their intimate control of their aircraft. What manner of men were they? Naval aviators were essentially volunteers, kept f lying by group bonding, the lure of adventure and the challenge of f lying off carriers. David Hobbs writes of how naval f lying, with all its complications, required a particular kind of courage and ‘can do’ attitude.114 Beyond the endurance and discipline needed to deal with the boredom of long maritime patrols, the qualities needed of a naval aviator were—above all—absolute nerve and confidence. In the words of a Falklands veteran, ‘There cannot be the slightest element of self doubt when you are f lying combat missions’.115 Naval aviators could die or have friends die in training, but could not afford to think about it. During the Second World War f lyers could anticipate heavy casualties. Fifty per cent losses were expected in the attack on Taranto in 1940,116 but aviators had to deny death and carry on, aided by peer group pressure.117 This kind of stoicism brought out their respect for the courage of enemy pilots.118 With their resolve in the face of danger, high degree of individualism and critical job of f leet defence, aviators became heroes and team champions among carrier crews. Japanese sailors applauded their pilots as they downed the first wave of American torpedo planes at Midway in 1942, in Walter Lord’s phrase ‘like a theater audience watching a superbly skillful performance’.119 Conversely, f lyers depended on carrier crews for all their support functions. Engineers and ordnance handlers performed arduous tasks for long hours, working under pressure amidst machinery and live explosives.120 Aviatiors bonded with the ships and crews who needed their protection.121 Aviators faced awesome experiences in action. In air-to-air combat, although not seeing their enemy face to face, they were seeking to kill in an individual way unusual in naval battle.A British carrier pilot in the Falklands recalled the fear of real combat, with the need to kill or be killed: a need one could not anticipate in training.There was universal fear and the sense of the inevitability of death.122\n\nNaval Battle - TEXT PAGES 3/4/03 2:05 PM Page 24\n\n24\n\n|\n\nTHE FACE OF NAVAL BATTLE\n\nImage Not Available\n\nPilots who attacked surface targets, however, give more of an impression of professional detachment, of performing a mechanical task. This probably relates to their having significantly more mobility than their targets and to their becoming in a sense their own weapon. But such experiences could be alarming. Australia’s Admiral Sir Victor Smith recalled leading the torpedo attack on the Scharnhorst early in the Second World War, f lying Swordfish aircraft off the coast of Norway: . . . a rather frightening experience but on the other hand in a situation like that there is no option and you have to press on. I think that that probably sums it up. It is very alarming when you are on a committed course heading towards the target . . . you are in some respects a sitting duck. That does not make life very pleasant.123\n\nAttacks on moored ships, as at Taranto or Pearl Harbor, could be similarly hair-raising.A pilot required great skill to manoeuvre his aircraft as a delivery system, precision to hit particular targets in particular ways and raw courage to f ly into enemy fire without being distracted. Besides the risk of being shot down there was the danger of misjudgement and crashing.124 Sometimes the elation of the attack and the ruthless commitment to achieving a kill could cause indifference to one’s own\n\nNaval Battle - TEXT PAGES 3/4/03 2:05 PM Page 25\n\nSETTING THE SCENE\n\n|\n\n25\n\nfate. An American divebomber pilot, having scored a direct hit on a Japanese carrier at Midway, found himself not caring when he seemed likely to crash while returning to the USS Yorktown. He survived.125 After action, aircrews had the problem of locating their ship: a small speck in the vastness of the sea. The relief at finding the carrier was coupled with the challenge of a deck landing before one was ‘home again’.126 Casualties among aviators could be very high.They were almost 100 per cent among the first American strike wave at Midway. Besides falling foul of enemy fire, aircraft could run out of fuel, often over the sea.The fuel factor therefore weighed heavily on the minds of aircrew.The US Navy f lyers sent to find the Japanese carriers in the Philippine Sea knew they had insufficient fuel to return safely to their ships.To press on with their mission took formidable courage and some men were lost at sea.127 Aviators ditching at sea or shot down over land could be taken prisoner. Not all were as fortunate as Sub-Lieutenant MacMillan and his observer Chief Petty Officer Hancox, two RAN f lyers forced down in Korea and rescued from the air while under fire.128 In the face of the multiplicity of risks, however, many naval aviators were still inspired by the experience of f lying: by its beauty, skill and exhilaration, all epitomised by a perfect deck landing.129\n\nNAVAL COMMAND While aspects of command are common to the various dimensions of war, certain factors have been unique to naval warfare or had heightened importance within it. Warships—as instruments of graduated force and as national symbols—have long had very significant diplomatic use. In peace and war the naval commander has often had to be a diplomat, in the tradition of officers such as Nelson, Perry and Cunningham.130 In action he has had considerable and sobering responsibilities, in command of an expensive strategic platform and set of capabilities as well as of its crew.The penalty for failure is peremptory: the loss of the ship, which cannot be rallied like a broken infantry battalion. A natural pitfall of naval command has therefore been operational conservatism, and protection of a f leet or vessel at the expense of its use. Overcoming this inhibition is critical, and the best naval commanders have therefore been known for their remarkable degree of aggression. Much of Nelson’s legacy boils down to the example of his ruthless desire to shock and annihilate the enemy.\n\nNaval Battle - TEXT PAGES 3/4/03 2:05 PM Page 26\n\n26\n\n|\n\nTHE FACE OF NAVAL BATTLE\n\nThere have been further complications for command at the unit and f leet level: the need to deal with people as well as technology (there is a certain parallel here with the air forces); the problem of both navigating and using a highly mobile weapons system, usually simultaneously; the need for individual initiative while being highly (and increasingly) integrated within a larger force; the need to consider often vast geographical areas; the need to comprehend the interrelationship of increasingly diverse vessel types; the imperative of increasingly rapid decision-making in battle in the context of technological change; and all this while being mindful of the need for inter-service cooperation and understanding— a fundamental consideration for a force which operates primarily as a critical enabler. There is also the physical positioning of the naval commander. Radio made shore command feasible at the higher strategic level, as practised successfully by Ramsay at Dover (during Dunkirk), Horton at Liverpool (in the Atlantic)131 and Nimitz in Hawaii (during the Pacific War). Such positioning, however, was not generally a feature of modern naval warfare. The f leet commander has usually had the advantages (often difficult to combine in command on land) of a frontline view and full communications at his disposal, enabling greater directness of control.132 The necessary price is the regular presence of high-ranking naval commanders in the combat zone.Von Spee, like many senior naval commanders, died a warrior’s death in battle.133 Collins was severely wounded when a kamikaze struck the bridge of the cruiser HMAS Australia at Leyte in 1944.134 Sustained physical courage has remained a prerequisite, and in this little has changed since the days of Nelson. Locating enemy vessels at sea, at the strategic level, places a premium on intelligence.The ability to use it f lexibly, as Cunningham did before Matapan,135 could be vital. In seeking to make contact with the enemy at the operational level, initiative could be a cardinal virtue as Andrew Gordon makes clear.136 It was at this level that the British Grand Fleet arguably failed at Jutland.137 At this level also, the advent of air reconnaissance and radar were breakthroughs, before which commanders had to rely solely upon eyesight at surface level. Conditions at sea can deceive the untrained eye, so experience was essential and good vision (like Cunningham’s) a great asset.138 Having placed the enemy, aggression was the key. One of Cunningham’s staff officers wrote of his usual behaviour in the presence of the enemy: ABC’s burning desire to get at them and utterly destroy them would at once become evident . . .

This mood was known colloquially among the staff as the ‘caged tiger act’ . . . It was always, for all beholders, an inspiring example of single-minded concentration on the one object of getting to close grips with the enemy.139\n\nAs Wayne Hughes concludes: ‘The tactical maxim of all naval battles is Attack effectively first’.140 At every point in the progression, from contemplating action to seeking out and engaging the enemy, the value of initiative and f lexibility—and the need to encourage them—is demonstrated by history. Cunningham’s brief verbal instructions to Collins in 1940, when he left Alexandria before winning the victory at Cape Spada, contrast somewhat with the 70 printed pages of operational instructions issued by Jellicoe to the Grand Fleet during the First World War.141 Fatigue and stress have always taken their toll on naval commanders, whether as a result of the intensity of f leet chases and engagements, the protracted strain of convoy duties and blockades, or simply the pressure of great responsibilities while commanding ashore. After a period of less than a year which saw Nelson’s starring role in the victory at Cape St Vincent, the defeat at Tenerife and the loss of his arm, and his unfinished search for Napoleon’s expeditionary force in the Mediterranean, he wrote in 1798 of the vulnerability of ‘my too irritable nerves’.142 Nimitz was depressed and suffered insomnia for several months after assuming command in the Pacific.143 After six months of continuous combat duty, Halsey was hospitalised with shingles in 1942.144 Walker’s death in 1944, after years of strain, has already been mentioned. In order to mitigate the cumulative effects of sea-riding, loneliness, complex decision-making and danger upon a middle-aged commander, it was necessary to have strengths and consolations. Nelson had a religious sense of duty, extraordinary physical and moral courage, and many people (including the women in his life) whom he loved.145 Cunningham had great energy and stamina, ruthlessness, incurable optimism and an infectious sense of humour, although even he would be mentally drained after six years of war.146 Ramsay had an admirable ability to delegate and rest, even in the midst of national crisis.147 Nimitz tossed horseshoes, listened to classical music, walked and swam, had dinners at which shop-talk was banned and delegated anything with which anyone else could deal.148 Keeping a written confessional in the form of a diary or correspondence proved an effective solace for naval commanders at various levels, as the cases of Von Spee, Layard and Woodward all\n\nNaval Battle - TEXT PAGES 3/4/03 2:05 PM Page 28\n\n28\n\n|\n\nTHE FACE OF NAVAL BATTLE\n\nattest.149 Of all aspects of naval command, it is stress and fatigue which most closely resemble the effects of war in other environments. In addition to preserving his own morale, the naval commander must sustain that of others. Like other military commanders he must be an actor, a therapist and a communicator. Cunningham was famous as a booster of the tired or defeated, filling his house with them. One of his destroyer commanders recalled being made to lie on the f loor after dinner and throw ping-pong balls into the light shade: ‘I wrote home to my family saying I felt certain we would win the war’.150 At sea, however, there are more unique aspects of inspirational naval command. For example, within the limited confines of a vessel it is feasible to keep crews informed of developments.151 With the assistance of modern internal broadcast systems this became practicable even aboard large vessels in the midst of action. People perform better when they are aware of the place of their work in the wider picture. More broadly, commanders at sea (at least at the level of unit command) have a scope and a need for interaction with their crews suggesting a contrast with war on land. Navies are relatively small human communities with fewer subordinates to know, brief and sustain.Their working spaces are more confined and their command atmosphere necessarily more relaxed than those of armies. For such reasons individual ships have personalities in a way infantry battalions do not. While naval commanders have not always been approachable or humane, they have had to interact with their people and set the tone in immediate and personal ways. On joining an escort vessel in the Atlantic in 1941, Michael Thwaites found himself well satisfied with his captain and quickly deduced that they would have a happy wardroom, and hence probably a happy ship.152 Even at f leet level,Woodward in the Falklands had confidence in his picket destroyer captains whom he knew personally and well. He spoke to them frequently, which boosted their morale (and his).153\n\nTHE FACES OF NAVAL, LAND AND AIR BATTLE COMPARED We can notice immediate similarities between battle experience at sea, on land and in the air. Sailors, soldiers and airmen are all vulnerable to the effects of climate and weather.All are required to deal with their fear in battle and to function amidst the din and confusion of combat; all must sometimes face the need to kill or be killed; and all can be surrounded by the bodies of the dead and wounded. A soldier in a tank,\n\nNaval Battle - TEXT PAGES 3/4/03 2:05 PM Page 29\n\nSETTING THE SCENE\n\n|\n\n29\n\nlike his compatriots in naval vessels and aircraft, is vulnerable as part of a weapons system which can be targeted as a whole. Above all, serving personnel in each environment are motivated by similar small group dynamics: the bonding based upon mutual confidence in the face of danger, as well as the individual’s fear of appearing before his peers to have been disabled by fear itself.\n\nNaval and land battle There are, however, factors distinguishing the experience of sailors from that of soldiers. Sailors are not treated as beasts of burden, as has been the lot of soldiers through the ages. Unlike soldiers they do not suffer the exhaustion of marches, nor the same effects of hunger and thirst.154 A fundamental point is that their attitude towards the enemy and to combat is necessarily different.Armies are trained to engage with human enemies which, even in counter-terrorism, have a human face.155 While recognisable as an animated being, that enemy must also be depersonalised to legitimate the act of individual killing, which can occur in face-to-face combat.156 As (then) Major Chris Keeble of the 2nd Battalion, the Parachute Regiment, described the battle at Goose Green in the Falklands: ‘You close up towards the trenches. You throw grenades, you fire your weapon, you bayonet. It’s savage gutter fighting. Everything you’ve ever experienced before is nothing like it. It is basic killing.’157 History suggests that, despite its horror, human beings can positively embrace licensed face-to-face killing.158 In modern warfare distance and chaos can blur this individual violence but still allow great technical satisfaction, and the act of killing for the first time can still be a major personal event.159 This kind of experience is alien to modern battle at sea, where even in combat between ships and piloted aircraft there is detachment. A British ship’s captain in the Falklands said of Argentinian air attacks: At that stage I didn’t think about the pilots who were bombing me. As far as I was concerned they were aircraft that were trying to hit my ship and it was very much a military action to try and shoot those aeroplanes down. I didn’t think of it in personal terms at all. That’s one of the things about being in the navy. It’s not quite as personalised as jumping into a trench with someone and trying to kill him.160\n\nSailors, by extension, do not generally suffer the stress felt by soldiers under bombardment when they cannot act or reply, since they can usually do one or both, although there can be a significant exception in the case of a submarine suffering a depth-charge attack.161\n\nNaval Battle - TEXT PAGES 3/4/03 2:05 PM Page 30\n\n30\n\n|\n\nTHE FACE OF NAVAL BATTLE\n\nShips in action become targets in terms of the capabilities they possess and the areas they command, not the ground they hold.The basic reason for the fierce discipline to which soldiers are subject is the need to overcome the human instinct to f ly from danger and, in the military sense, to hold ground. When this discipline is threatened under fire, troops can bunch, panic, be paralysed, or run.162 Sailors—confined, preoccupied, often having to fight or die and with nowhere to run— comparatively rarely succumb to panic or breakdown.163 Similarly, combat refusal does not generally occur at sea on any scale, nor does the sailor seek or rejoice in a ‘Blighty’ wound which will take him to safety for he remains in the battle line. These distinguishing features of naval battle derive from the hostile environment of the sea.Within it, aboard the vessels themselves, there is an intensely human atmosphere for they are without many animals (horses, by contrast, being long-standing elements of war on land).164 At the same time, while civilians—especially merchant seamen—suffered grievously from the U-boat campaigns, this human world af loat has been generally spared their presence.Almost as much as in the desert of North Africa, trauma is lessened in naval warfare by not having to witness the mass suffering of non-combatants.165 Compassion is exhausted faster than courage. Naval warfare is marked by the essentially singular interaction of professional military personnel with ‘the cruel sea’.166 This interaction occurs continuously and has a life of its own, regardless of the state of military operations. The sea has an undeniable romance and natural wonder. Many have written of the brilliant, myriad aspects of its beauty. In the words of a long-serving naval officer: ‘over my years at sea I have seen God’s creation in all its splendour and in all its fearful power’.167 Respect for that power is ingrained in those who have seen hurricanes, fogs, icy decks, freezing waters and high seas which can sweep men overboard into darkness. The sea is more powerful than war. Atlantic weather could stop U-boat operations, forcing boats to submerge 50 metres to be still.168 Such weather was more often the enemy for escort crews than was the Kriegsmarine. Allied sailors had frequently to alternate between fighting the waters and fighting the U-boats without rest.169 Most sailors, wrote Admiral Sandy Woodward, are superstitious: surely a consequence of living in the presence of the power of the sea.170 (Sailors often speak of their belief in luck and lucky ships, and Collins even entitled his autobiography As Luck Would Have It.)171 The enterprise of going to sea thus creates a perceptible bond between sailors, as David Stevens relates.172\n\nNaval Battle - TEXT PAGES 3/4/03 2:05 PM Page 31\n\nSETTING THE SCENE\n\n|\n\n31\n\nThis can cause understanding between navies often to be better than between compatriot navies and armies.173 This bond very often survives combat between navies at sea. While examples of chivalry in land warfare are far from unknown, such cases exist in abundance in naval history. Examples include Captain Glossop’s care for the wounded of the defeated Emden in 1914 and Collins’ rescuing of the survivors of the Italian destroyer Espero in 1940 at the risk of his own ship.174 Even amidst the total war of the Battle of the Atlantic, the captain of a Norwegian vessel torpedoed by Cremer’s U-333 recalled the U-boat commander’s very humane attitude towards his opponents:‘He behaved according to the code of seamen who take no oath on it but know: help one another when in trouble at sea!’.175 Naval warfare is unique in having a third participant, one which is always neutral—the cruel sea, which answers to no human being.\n\nNaval and air battle There have been obvious similarities between the battle experience of naval aviators and that of operational air force personnel.
