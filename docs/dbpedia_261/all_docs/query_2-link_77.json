        "text": "In August of this year when visiting a school friend from decades ago, Kathleen introduced me to the gravesite of one of Ireland’s better known poets, Patrick Kavanagh, in the very pretty County Monaghan village of Inniskeen, just up the road from her own home.\n\nThis disused church houses the Patrick Kavanagh Centre where Kavanagh’s memory is preserved and honoured.\n\nNovember 30 2017 marked the 50th anniversary of his death. Revered as of one of Ireland’s better known poets the date was marked yesterday with special ceremonies at the Patrick Kavanagh Centre.\n\nPatrick Kavanagh was born in the village of Inniskeen on October 21, 1904. For some decades he worked the land here – a place that informed some of his best writing. His novel ‘Tarry Flynn’ could almost be autobiographical as it tells the story of a young fella not unlike himself, constrained and frustrated by his rural existence – hard-working with a lack of romantic affiliations in a clerical repressed Ireland. One of his better known poems also follows these themes.\n\nStony Grey Soil\n\nO stony grey soil of Monaghan\n\nThe laugh from my love you thieved;\n\nYou took the gay child of my passion\n\nAnd gave me your clod-conceived.\n\nYou clogged the feet of my boyhood\n\nAnd I believed that my stumble\n\nHad the poise and stride of Apollo\n\nAnd his voice my thick tongued mumble.\n\nYou told me the plough was immortal!\n\nO green-life conquering plough!\n\nThe mandril stained, your coulter blunted\n\nIn the smooth lea-field of my brow.\n\nYou sang on steaming dunghills\n\nA song of cowards’ brood,\n\nYou perfumed my clothes with weasel itch,\n\nYou fed me on swinish food\n\nYou flung a ditch on my vision\n\nOf beauty, love and truth.\n\nO stony grey soil of Monaghan\n\nYou burgled my bank of youth!\n\nLost the long hours of pleasure\n\nAll the women that love young men.\n\nO can I still stroke the monster’s back\n\nOr write with unpoisoned pen.\n\nHis name in these lonely verses\n\nOr mention the dark fields where\n\nThe first gay flight of my lyric\n\nGot caught in a peasant’s prayer.\n\nMullahinsa, Drummeril, Black Shanco-\n\nWherever I turn I see\n\nIn the stony grey soil of Monaghan\n\nDead loves that were born for me.\n\nAmong his well-known works is the epic poem ‘The Great Hunger’ which can be read here Poem The Great Hunger.\n\nI was particularly intrigued by the simplicity of his grave, which like its occupant has an interesting history.\n\nWith a simple cross as a marker, there is a further inscribed tablet on the grave: There were stepping stones across a stream, part of my life was there, the happiest part.\n\nPatrick’s younger brother Peter was often described as ‘his brother’s keeper’ and indeed it was he who encouraged his older brother to move to Dublin to nurture his word craft and he also supported him financially. Patrick dedicated all of his books to Peter and appointed him as his official biographer. Peter emigrated to America in 1946 to take up a post as Professor of Poetry at Loyola University, Chicago. When Patrick married his long-term companion, Katherine Barry Moloney (niece of Kevin Barry, executed in 1920 for his part in an Irish Volunteer operation which resulted in the deaths of three British soldiers) in April 1967, just months before his death, the family was dismayed. They never accepted the marriage. When she died in 1989 she quite naturally was buried beside him and her estate arranged for a headstone of her choosing to be erected over the grave.\n\nUnfortunately however, this very elegant headstone disappeared one night and was found smashed. This simple cross was erected in its place, with no mention of Katherine.\n\nIt was felt that Peter was responsible.\n\nAugust 12 1988 Irish Independent\n\nIreland’s literati are baffled by unusual happenings at the grave of one of the most famous Irish poets. The headstone memorial on the last resting place of poet Patrick Kavanagh vanished during the night from Inniskeen churchyard in Co Monaghan. Kavanagh died in Dublin in 1967 aged 63.Yesterday it was discovered an old Burma-teak cross and stepping-stones had been placed on the grave by the poet’s brother Dr Peter Kavanagh, a US lecturer, who is currently on holiday at the family homestead…..Yesterday Dr Kavanagh denied he had anything to do with the mysterious removal of the memorial from the grave.\n\n“It seems to have been taken away by spirits in the night,” he claimed, adding “but I am delighted to learn it has gone. We decided to bring back the old Burma teak cross and the stepping stones to the grave – these really perpetuate Patrick’s memory. He was the only Catholic poet in Ireland and the memorial which was erected was a pagan monument.”\n\nThe controversy continued in the letters page of The Irish Times\n\nThe Kavanagh Grave\n\nFri, Aug 14, 1998, 01:00\n\nWhat was stolen yesterday was a headstone on which were simply recorded the names and life dates of both Patrick Kavanagh and his wife Katherine, together with some lines of Kavanagh’s poetry.\n\nThis headstone was not erected by “a commemoration committee”, but by Katherine’s sister and executrix Helen Moloney, and was paid for by the estate in the normal way. This was in fulfilment of Katherine’s wishes. The only other significant direction in her will had been that such assets as she had, and her interest as copyright holder of Patrick’s work, should go in their entirety to a trust to commemorate her late husband by providing financial support for needy poets in their middle years.\n\nThe headstone was erected only after the grave had lain bare for some months, following the sudden removal of the original coverings and cross dating from the late 1960s, some weeks after Katherine’s burial. The first Katherine’s family learnt of that removal was from the newspapers.\n\nThe result of the theft – and, it now transpires, of the destruction of the headstone and surrounds erected by Helen Moloney – is that Katherine now lies unacknowledged next to her husband in Inniskeen graveyard.\n\nYou quote one person as describing the dignified and distinctive headstone now destroyed as somehow “pagan”. What could be more un-Christian than to despoil a grave in such a way as to deny a blameless woman public acknowledgement that she lies in death, as she did in life, with her husband? – Yours, etc., Eunan O’Halpin (nephew of Katherine Kavanagh and of Helen Moloney),\n\nParnell Road,\n\nHarold’s Cross,\n\nDublin 6.\n\nAs we commemorate the 50th anniversary of the death of Patrick Kavanagh and as his brother Peter has also passed away, surely it is now time for reconciliation and to have the poet’s wife recognized on the grave, now ‘where old ghosts meet’?\n\nAlthough not inspired by his wife, Kavanagh’s great poem ‘On Raglan Road’ has been immortalized in song by the great late Luke Kelly. While Kavanagh would not rank in my list of favourite poets, like tens of thousands of Irish, I do love this song and the poetry of it.\n\nWith special thanks to my school friend Kathleen Murphy Sharkey for introducing me to this special place!\n\nReferences\n\nIrish Independent\n\nThe Irish Times\n\nWikipedia.org\n\nThose of us who live around Midleton, a small town in the east of County Cork, Ireland, are very proud of an impressive art installation that marks a very poignant moment in Irish history.\n\nThis sculpture honours an extraordinary gift from the Choctaw Native Americans to the starving Irish during the Great Famine that raged through Ireland in the 19th Century. It was created by Alex Pentek at the Sculpture Factory in Cork, Ireland and installed in Bailick Park, Midleton in 2015.\n\nNative Americans of the Choctaw, Chickasaw, Seminole, Creek and Cherokee tribes lived in traditional tribal lands in parts of Georgia, Alabama, North Carolina, Florida and Tennessee. However, this valuable land was coveted by white settlers who wished to grow cotton. Andrew Jackson signed the Indian Removal Act that authorized forcible eviction from their native land. In the winter of 1831 under threat of invasion by the U.S.Army, 17,000 Choctaw were first to be expelled from their homelands. They began migrating on foot to Indian Territory, now a part of Oklahoma, along what became known as the ‘trail of tears’. With no help from the government and often without food and supplies and in dreadful weather conditions, many thousands died along the way. It is estimated that nearly one third of the Choctaw Nation perished due to starvation, exposure and disease on the 500 mile walk, the ‘trail of tears’.\n\nSeveral years later the Choctaw Nation, on hearing of the famine that had struck Ireland in 1845, made a donation of $170 to the Famine Relief Fund of Ireland. Whilst many donations were made for famine relief at that time, what makes the Choctaw donation stand out is that they were living in great hardship and poverty at that time.\n\nIt is in recognition of that fantastic gesture that this sculpture, appropriately named ‘Kindred Spirits’ was created.\n\nThe sculpture consists of nine 20-foot (6.1 m) stainless steel eagle feathers arranged in a circle, to represent an empty bowl.\n\nNo two feathers are the same.\n\nAlthough there is no direct connection between Midleton and the Choctaw donation of 1847, we are delighted to have such a wonderful piece of public art in our area. It can be seen from the Cork to Waterford N25 road, when travelling in the direction of Waterford. It has become something of a tourist attraction and has regular visitors – individuals, small groups and entire school classes.\n\nProbably one of Ireland’s most impressive public sculptures, it is a fitting tribute to the generosity of the Choctaw Nation who saw themselves as our kindred spirits in our time of need. I love it and hope you enjoy looking at it as much as I do!\n\nReferences\n\nhttp://www.choctawnation.com/\n\nWikipedia\n\nhttp://www.History.com\n\nNewtonwforbes in County Longford is a small village located just a few miles outside Longford town, on the busy N4 Dublin to Sligo road. Originally known as Lisbrack (Lios Breac in Irish), the name was changed to Newtownforbes in the middle of the 18th Century by the Forbes family, who were granted the lands here in the early 1600s. The Forbes family, with the title Earls of Granard, have lived in the village for over 300 years.\n\nThe present Castle was constructed in the 19th Century – the original built c.1624 was destroyed by fire. As this is a family home, the entire demesne is private and not open to the public.\n\nIn 1911, the grey squirrel was introduced here. An indigenous species of North America, several pairs were given as a wedding gift to a member of the Forbes family in 1911. A number escaped and went on to breed prolifically and almost annihilate the native Irish red squirrel. Fortunately the progress of the grey squirrel seems to have finally been halted in recent years, and the red squirrel is again increasing in numbers.\n\nThe main street in Newtownforbes has remained largely unchanged over the decades with modern development confined largely to side streets. Two churches dominate the village, both provided by the Forbes family. The Church of Ireland church of St. Paul, built about 1820, replaced an earlier church from 1694. The graveyard here has been mapped and recorded by a local team of dedicated volunteers lead by Doreen McHugh and Des Mooney. The earliest recorded burial dates to 1698. The results of their work can be seen on the Historic Graves website. See the link below.\n\nThere is a Forbes family crypt in this churchyard and interestingly, and unusually I would think, there is another Forbes family mausoleum attached to the Roman Catholic Church of St. Mary’s.\n\nThe Catholic Church of St Mary’s, where I was baptized, is in the centre of the village. This is the parish church of Clonguish. It has been almost totally remodelled in recent times.\n\nHowever, it used to look like this:\n\nThe ‘explanation’ for this dramatic change appears on this plaque at the side of the church. It would appear that the term ‘restoration’ can have a very broad meaning!\n\nEither side of the main entrance door are two carved heads, which may or may not represent specific people. These are part of the original church, built 1861-1864.\n\nI had hoped that some of the interior survived the renewal, in particular the baptismal font at which I was christened, but I was to be disappointed. With the possible exception of the brass sanctuary lamp, some stained glass windows and the mosaic memorial to the local nobility, everything else seems to be modern.\n\nThe new round stained glass window is very attractive and compliments the interior. The original side aisles have been removed and everything within seems to be very modern.\n\nReturning to this little village in the midlands of Ireland is always poignant. The Station House, in which we were born and where we spent many happy times with our grandparents, was built in the 1860s and closed as a railway station in 1963 . It is now a beautifully maintained private residence. It is always nice to stand on the little bridge and look down to the place where we made many happy memories.\n\nThe railway line is still in use. I have lovely memories of walking along the line with my grandfather. The main telephone lines ran on poles along the line in those days. and he used to lift me up and place my ear against the poles to hear them ‘singing’.\n\nIt was always exciting to cross over this little bridge as we knew we had arrived for more adventures!\n\nQuite near the Station is the abandoned Lisbrack House. Most recently a nursing home, it was once a school and a bishop’s home. To the best of my recollection our mother was taught to play the piano in this building by a very cranky nun who was also a great pianist!\n\nAnother prominent religious site on the main street is the Convent of the Sisters of Mercy. About 1869 the nuns were invited here by the Earl of Granard who provided the site for the buildings to enable them to educate the children of the estate. An orphanage and industrial school were also established here. Sadly this site had a role in the tragic legacy of such establishments in Ireland. The school and convent are now closed and I understand that these rather nice buildings are now apartments.\n\nThe village has many buildings from the 19th and early 20th centuries. The two storey tudor style house is one of a pair provided for estate workers and it was in these that County Longford’s first flushing toilets were installed.\n\nMany of the houses would would have originally been thatched and unfortunately many are no longer occupied.\n\nThe former RIC Barracks built c. 1900 was burned during the War of Independence. It was later rebuilt for the use of the Garda Siochana (Irish Police) and is now a private residence.\n\nThis interesting item is the Famine Pump. It was provided by Lord Granard as a Famine Relief scheme. It sits alongside a building that started life as a shooting range in Longford army barracks. It was purchased by a local who erected here c.1933 and is known locally as Christy’s Hall.\n\nThe hard work of the local tidy towns volunteers is evident throughout the village.\n\nAnd local junior artists have also been decorating the hoarding surrounding the former school buildings.\n\nA board inside the church lists the townlands in the parish of Clonguish, which derives from the Irish ‘Cluain Geis’ which means The Meadow of the Swans.\n\nNewtownforbes is the last resting place of our grandparents and an uncle and aunt so visits nowadays are to pay respects at their graves in the new cemetery.\n\nOne of the great delights of my brief visit discovering a great little restaurant called Tús Nua right on the main street, so if you happen to be passing through, drop in for a wee wander through this quaint little village and enjoy a fabulous coffee in this delightful coffee house!\n\nReferences\n\nhttp://historicgraves.com/graveyard/newtown-forbes/ld-spnf\n\nhttp://http://catalogue.nli.ie/Record/vtls000317412\n\nHome\n\nYesterday I attended a conference at the Irish Workhouse Centre in Portumna,Co Galway. This was my first visit to this complex of buildings, which date from 1850. Workhouses were introduced in 19th Century Ireland to provide food and shelter for the destitute. The very name ‘Workhouse’ has terrible connotations to this day because of the awful conditions in which the inmates lived.\n\nFamilies were split up on arrival with separate wings for men, women, boys aged between 2 and 15 and girls aged between 2 and 15 . Children under the age of 2 could stay with their mother. Parents were permitted ‘ to have an interview with their child at some time in each day’, other than that, there was total segregation. How cruel for little children who would not understand what was going on.\n\nAt the height of the Great Famine that raged from 1845 to 1851 or 1852, the poor were clamoring for admittance. Buildings built to accommodate 600 people could have been packed to overflowing with 1,600 people. The daily food allowance was minimal and of poor nutritional value, and many inmates of these establishments died of disease such as dysentery, cholera and typhus.\n\nInmates had to work in exchange for food and shelter. Women took care of laundry, scrubbed floors, did the cooking and did sewing and mending while men did often meaningless heavy work such as breaking stones. The laundry area has some very fine industrial archaeology.\n\nBy the end of the Great Famine Ireland had 163 Workhouses. Many of these eventually became local hospitals and still stand today as care centres for the elderly. Many have been demolished and have disappeared without trace.\n\nThis wonderful project in Portumna which houses the Irish Workhouse Centre is a credit to those who had the foresight to save these buildings from total dereliction. Steady progress is being made with restoration and conservation work. The centre is in use for educational purposes and there are plans for a Workhouse Museum. The guided tours of the buildings are a revelation, and are conducted with knowledgeable enthusiasm.\n\nOnly a handful of Workhouses remain in their original format. This unique complex of buildings in Portumna stands testament to the history of the ordinary people of Ireland, the non landed gentry from whom most of us descend. Ordinary people who endured extraordinary hardship – many of them died, many emigrated, many survived too. This is a tangible monument to them all and deserves our support.\n\nFor more information see http://www.irishworkhousecentre.ie\n\nJust the other week, I came upon a grave in Trinity Churchyard in Carrigart, my hometown, on which was recorded a World War 1 death. Amazing to think that I grew up in a parish in north Donegal and never heard about a young local man who by the age of 23 had received two bravery awards and had given his life in the 1st World War\n\nThis family headstone in the Trinity Churchyard in Carrigart, records the deaths of three sons, two of whom predeceased their parents. One of these had two bravery awards and was killed in France in 1917.\n\nSo what is the story of James Fisher? Who was he?\n\nJames was born in Umlagh outside Carrigart on December 10, 1893, the eldest son and third child of James Fisher and his wife Helen McIlwane.\n\nThe 1901 census tells us that parents James and Helen were living in Umlagh with their 7 children, Rachel aged 10, Margaret 9, James 7, Kezie 5, Alexander 4, John 2 and David 6 months and James’ brother John. The census record can be seen here.\n\nBy 1911, David, born on October 9, 1900, had died in 1905, Rachel and Margaret were no longer living at home, but the family had 5 new members. The household at that time consisted of father James, mother Helen and John senior as well as young James, now 17, Kezie who was 16, Alexander who was 14, John who was 12, and new arrivals Annie aged 9, Margery 7, Catherine Susan aged 5, Aaron who was 3 and another David, then only 2 months old, born on January 21, 1911. The 1911 census record for the family can be seen here.\n\nJames enlisted in the Royal Inniskilling Fusiliers and then transferred to the Machine Gun Corps, specializing in, as the name suggests, machine gun duties. In 1916 Lance Corporal James Fisher was awarded the Distinguished Conduct Medal, (the DCM,) for gallantry and the news was carried in The Derry Journal in September of that year.\n\nThe citation for this award was as follows:\n\n‘18679 Actg. L/Cpl J Fisher Mach. Gun Corps (LG 22 Sept. 1916)\n\nFor conspicuous gallantry in action. When his seniors had become casualties he took command of the gun team and pushed forward. Later he took his gun into a shell hole, caught the enemy in the open , and drove back their counter attack.’\n\nThe Distinguished Conduct Medal\n\nJames was a very brave young man as he was again recognized for gallantry winning another Distinguished Conduct Medal or ‘Bar’. The 207th Machine Gun Company was attached to the 3rd Australian Division between October 1916 and October 1917 and it was during this time that he won the second award. The citation for his second or ‘bar’ award of the DCM is as follows:\n\n‘A/Corpl James Fisher D.C.M. For conspicuous gallantry on the night of 17/18 May 1917, when in charge of a Machine Gun in very exposed position on ?? the enemy attempted a raid of ? Gap at the same time heavily bombarding ? . No 18679 Corporal J Fisher at once opened fire on his S.O.S target ‘D’ Gap(?) and continued to fire although shells were bursting all around his position, and in spite of the fact that he received blows on the head and in the small of the back from shrapnel. Owing to the protection of his steel helmet and belt respectively, the only injuries received were bruises. His sub-section(?) officer tried to persuade him to be relieved at the gun, but he stuck to his post till the situation became normal, although in a dazed and deafened state. After the raid was over he wanted to stay with his gun, but was ordered by his officer to go to Section Headquarters for the night. Besides materially helping to repel the raid, the example set to the N.C.O.s and men of this Company will have a far reaching effect‘\n\nThis recommendation is recorded is the 9th Infantry Brigade, 3rd Australian Division on 22 May 1917.\n\nHowever his luck ran out and Sergeant James Fisher, DCM bar Service No. 18679, was killed on September 25, 1917, probably at the Third Battle of Ypres. At this time it appears that the Machine Gun unit was no longer attached to the Australian forces. James probably died around Polderhoek Chateau Ridge on the morning of September 25, 1917, when the British were about to launch their own attack.\n\nIn a History and memoir of the 33rd Battalion of the Machine Gun Corps, the events of the fateful day are recorded;\n\n‘By 12 midnight on the 24th-25th September …the 207th Machine Gun Company..was ordered to be in position by 1 a.m on the morning of the 25th, about 159 yards behind our front posts.. About 3.30 on the morning of the 25th, the enemy opened a bombardment of hitherto unparalleled intensity upon our front.\n\nThe 207th Company, which…was close behind our front line grouped in batteries, opened fire with sixteen guns at almost point blank range into the massed hordes of the enemy. The enemy was concentrated behind Polderhoek Chateau Ridge… Low flying enemy aeroplanes soon, however, detected (them) and both by machine gunning and directing artillery upon the 207th Machine Gun Company, the enemy inflicted very severe casualties amongst the gunners’\n\nThe body of James Fisher was never found, possibly blown to bits. He is commemorated on the Tyne Cot Memorial for the missing, as his grave is not known. He is one of 34,992 young men whose remains were never recovered and whose names are inscribed on this wall.\n\nAt the time of his death, James was owed £45/10/5 plus a war gratuity of £16/10/0 which sum was paid to his father on November 15 1919. Not much consolation for the terrible loss of a beloved son.\n\nWhen researching this post, I made a table of the men from our parish of Mevagh, either born there or who had lived there at one time, and was astonished to find so many who had died between 1914 and 1918. This data has been extracted from the County Donegal Book of Honour, The Great War 1914-1918. These records are confined to deaths in the years 1914 to 1918 only and do not include, for example, a Mevagh man who is buried in Clontallagh who died in 1919.\n\nThe statistics are quite startling. In 1914, 2 men from our parish died, 3 died in 1915, 1 in 1916. In 1917, 9 died – 4 of them in a 4 week period alone (and one on the same day as James Fisher) – and 7 died in 1918.\n\nIt would be interesting to cross reference the data in the book with the civil records and census records now online and to include those who died from wounds after the 1918 cut off date. and to find their military records.\n\nSergeant James Fisher D.C.M (Bar) of Umlagh is the most decorated of these Mevagh men and he lost his life 100 years ago. He deserves to be remembered as a son of our parish, as indeed, do all of these men who lost their lives in that conflict.\n\nThere is, I understand, a commemorative plaque in the Carrigart Presbyterian Church. I must try to get a photo, if that is allowed.\n\nTHE PITY OF WAR!\n\nSources\n\nCounty Donegal Book of Honour, The Great War 1914-1918.\n\nAustralian War Memorial at https:/www.awm.gov.au/collection/R1590453\n\nhttp://www.cwgc.org/find-war-dead/casualty/1631955/fisher,-james/.\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Action _of _25- September_1917\n\nhttps:/archive.org//stream/historymemoirof300unse#page/32/mode/2up/searfch/207th\n\nAncestry.com UK Army Registers of Effects 1901-1929\n\nWith thanks to Damian Shiels, Military Historian, for his help in sourcing information for this post.\n\nRosguill is a peninsula in north Donegal pointing out into the Atlantic Ocean, to the west of the well known Inishowen and Fanad Peninsulas. It is on the Wild Atlantic Way and has scenery to rival anywhere in Ireland. It is also in my home parish of Mevagh and any trip home is not complete without a jaunt along the Atlantic Drive.\n\nOur village of Carrigart lies at the entrance to the peninsula and it was from here that I headed out last week and I hope you enjoy these few snaps from my phone.\n\nCarrigart village is on the shores of the sheltered Mulroy Bay overlooked by Gainne a high hill across the shore. The Carrigart restaurant is under new management and offers a very interesting menu for travellers and a very comforting log fire!\n\nLeaving the village of Carrigart we head towards the neighbouring village of Downings crossing the area known locally as the Lee. Years ago horse racing was held here and it was a great venue for young boys playing soccer. This stone bridge, Ballyhogan Bridge, used to be an iron bridge and we children were subjected to awful warnings from adults about the particular part of a stream that flowed under it, known as ‘The Black Hole’.\n\nDownings, on Sheephaven Bay, has a couple of hotels and a number of restaurants. as well as the famous McNutts weavers. Once it was a very busy herring fishing port. Its maritime history is acknowledged near the pier with a memorial to locals who drowned in the area, including the three little McCorkell children who drowned in 1921 when herding geese and they were cut off by the tide. The inscription belies the fact that their little bodies were not all recovered immediately. Their father William recovered 5 year old Elizabeth at Aughadahor on March 22nd; 7 year old Jane was found by Edward Shiels on Downings Beach on March 29th and Willie aged 3, was found washed up on Downings Beach by Cornelius Boyce on April 7th. What a terrible tragedy for the family who lived in Aughadahor, which is on the upper end of nearby Tramore Beach.\n\nAlso at Downings Pier is a gun from the SS Laurentic, an armed merchant cruiser that sank after hitting two mines off Fanad Head on January 25, 1917 with the loss of 354 lives. The gun was salvaged by the Downings Diving group. These memorials are my first stopping-off point as I like to remember that the sea in all its majesty, also claims lives.\n\nHeading on, there is some spectacular scenery to the left out over Sheephaven Bay, looking towards the Ards Peninsula and Marble Hill strand with Muckish in the background. Sheephaven Bay lies between the Rosguill Peninsula and Horn Head. Stopping places are limited but there are some viewing points along the way. At Dooey, the little beach slopes dramatically and depending on the weather and tides it may be accessible, but is not safe for swimming.\n\nA few hundred metres further along there is a magnificent viewing point with views of Horn Head, back towards Dooey, and Tory Island, just about visible to the right of Horn Head, and the wild Atlantic Ocean.\n\nIn spite of the strong wind blowing on the day of my visit, the sea looked relatively calm. a large swell was expected the following day.\n\nHere is one of my favourite views. This abandoned house was once the home of a salt working family. The 1st edition Ordinance Survey map (produced in the first half of the 19th century) shows the little cobbled beach as ‘Salt Pans’ where salt was extracted from the sea water\n\nA short distance away is probably one of the most spectacular views in Ireland.\n\nThe famous postcard pair of beaches at Tranarossan.\n\nThe next photo of Tranarossan was taken last year on a very misty day when the sea was very calm. Tranarossan has so many moods..it is different at every visit!\n\nJust above Tranarossan Bay it is possible to see some hard won little fields, in all probability fertilized with sea weed to turn the rough scrub into lush green fields.\n\nI often think that I would not mind living in this sheltered little valley with this spectacular backdrop!\n\nDriving up the hill, a breathtaking view opens out ahead. This is the entrance to Mulroy Bay, where the Atlantic rushes in between the Rosguill and Fanad Peninsulas.\n\nMulroy Bay is a very scenic stretch of water. A bridge now connects the two peninsulas\n\nThe ancient graveyard and church ruins of Mevagh, from which the parish takes its name, are located here at the water’s edge. Here too is an ancient early christian cross.\n\nOn a clearer very calm day some years ago I was able to take these pictures.\n\nView from Carrigart village towards Island Roy\n\nAt the end of the Atlantic Drive, Tramore beach comes into view again.\n\nThe Atlantic Drive, only a few miles long, is to my mind, one of the most spectacular routes anywhere in Ireland.\n\nThere are two professional landscape photographers in the area, if you would like to see stunning images from this beautiful part of Donegal and across the county, click on the links below!\n\nScenes of Donegal\n\nRita Wilson Photography\n\nJust outside the village of Slane, County Meath is the Francis Ledwidge Museum. The museum is housed in the family home with a yard and garden to the rear.\n\nFrancis was born in this small cottage that dates from 1886, the 8th of 9 children. His father died soon after the 9th child was born. Desperately poor, their mother laboured in the fields to keep bread on the table until the eldest son, Patrick was sufficiently educated to get a job and help the family. However, Patrick contracted tuberculosis and had to return home and their mother was forced to return to her back -breaking labouring.\n\nFrancis left school at 15 and took whatever work he could get – he worked as a farm labourer, as a groom, in a copper mine and as a foreman on the roads. All the while he was writing poetry and having some poems published in the local newspaper. His poetry was brought to the attention of Lord Dunsany who arranged for publication in London and who also got introductions to literary figures of the day.\n\nHaving for a time been involved with the Irish Volunteers who sought Home Rule, Francis enlisted in the Royal Inniskilling Fusiliers on October 24, 1914. It is possible that his decision to join up may have been influenced by the fact that he was disappointed in love. He wrote to a friend saying that he looked forward to poetry and fame after the war and that by joining he hoped to bring peace to the world.\n\nHe came home on leave to Slane at Christmas and was shocked to learn of the death of a little boy he knew well, who had herded cows past the Ledwidge house. Francis wrote what is one of my favourite Ledwidge poems, A Little Boy in the Morning\n\nHe will not come, and still I wait.\n\nHe whistles at another gate\n\nWhere angels listen. Ah I know\n\nHe will not come, yet if I go\n\nHow shall I know he did not pass\n\nbarefooted in the flowery grass?\n\nThen in 1915 he wrote this lovely Lullaby to a tired child\n\nShall I take the rainbow out of the sky\n\nAnd the moon from the well in the lane\n\nAnd break them in pieces to coax your eye\n\nTo slumber a wee while again?\n\nWhile based in Basingstoke he heard of the death in childbirth of the girl he had loved and he got leave to attend her funeral in Manchester. He wrote\n\nTo One Dead\n\nA blackbird singing\n\nOn a moss-upholstered stone,\n\nBluebells swinging,\n\nShadows wildly blown,\n\nA song in the wood,\n\nA ship on the sea.\n\nThe song was for you\n\nand the ship was for me.\n\nOn August 7, 1915 Francis and his comrades in D Company landed in Suvla Bay in Gallipoli. The conditions were awful, the stench from corpses, dysentery, and swarming flies all added to the horror. When they pulled out on September 30th, 19,000 of their comrades had been killed. They were sent marching towards Salonika, but Francis became ill and he was sent back to England at about the same time as the Easter Rising was happening in Dublin. His good friends Patrick Pearse and Thomas McDonagh were among the first to be executed. He then wrote what is probably his most famous poem\n\nA Lament for Thomas MacDonagh\n\nHe shall not hear the bittern cry\n\nIn the wild sky, where he is lain,\n\nNor voices of the sweeter birds,\n\nAbove the wailing of the rain.\n\nNor shall he know when loud March blows\n\nThro’ slanting snows her fanfare shrill,\n\nBlowing to flame the golden cup\n\nOf many an upset daffodil.\n\nBut when the Dark Cow leaves the moor,\n\nAnd pastures poor with greedy weeds,\n\nPerhaps he’ll hear her low at morn,\n\nLifting her horn in pleasant meads.\n\nNow in B Company, 1st Battalion of the 29th Division, he set sail for France and eventually ended up in Ypres where in mid July the Third Battle of Ypres began. on July 31st when engaged in road marking a shell exploded near him. The chaplain wrote: ‘Ledwidge killed, blown to bits’\n\nThe Ledwidge home is now a Museum where it is possible read from his many letters, and to see how he lived in his beloved Slane.\n\nIt was a special thrill to visit this place, his home and his garden, just a few weeks after the centenary of his death.\n\nHe is buried at Artillery Wood Cemetery, Ieper, Belgium.\n\nReferences\n\nFrancis Ledwidge ‘Poet of the Blackbird’ published by Francis Ledwidge Museum\n\nCommonwealth Graves Commission\n\nPublished collections\n\nSongs of the Fields published 1916\n\nSongs of Peace published 1917\n\nLast Songs published 1918\n\nEvery once in a while you stumble on a little treasure of a place and want to tell the world! Such was our experience last Sunday afternoon in the village of Kilmacrennan in North Donegal, Ireland.\n\nOn a day filled with torrential downpours we were in need of some comforting food, and so we stopped at the very pretty group of thatched cottages on the Creeslough end of the village. This group of little thatched buildings have been in Kilmacrennan for some 150 years and previously housed a museum.\n\nThey are now under the management of a young couple who have exciting plans for these lovely buildings.\n\nIf you fancy a B &B in an authentic thatched Irish cottage, this is the place for you! This beautiful cottage is available to rent on Air B and B.\n\nThe former little dairy will be used for workshops.\n\nThe largest building houses a tea and coffee shop, and when you step inside you know you have arrived somewhere special! It’s not just a matter of tea or coffee, it’s so much more! Wonderful food, wonderful atmosphere and a warm welcome await!\n\nThe light lunch we enjoyed was very special with artisan breads and very creative choices of savoury and sweet options served in beautiful surroundings.\n\nThe centre piece is of course the open fire with a blazing turf fire and a crane with a selection of cooking pots that were used in times gone by.\n\nWe were just a little too early for the music sessions that happens here on a Sunday afternoon but there was a lovely atmosphere even without it!\n\nIt’s great to see new ventures and people thinking outside to box to provide unique high quality services to locals and visitors alike. I heartily recommend a visit to this lovely place, for either breakfast, lunch or a coffee break …you will not be disappointed!\n\nA gem of a place!\n\nCoffee Time Cafe Facebook page is at https://www.facebook.com/tiscoffeetime/\n\nTwitter account is @tiscoffeetime"
