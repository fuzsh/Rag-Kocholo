        "text": "This is the second of three articles aimed at studying the Treaty of Friendship and Commerce between Spain and Morocco, 1767, from the perspective of Translatology and History of Translation. In this second part, we describe how translation and interpreting, from Arabic into Spanish and vice versa, were conceived in 1769, and in the 18th century. Those who acted or could have acted as linguistic mediators in the Treaty, and their circumstances are analysed, with the emphasis on the talbes, translators and interpreters of the Moroccan Sultan; on the Spanish military interpreters from Berberia, with special reference to Francisco Pacheco, and on the Oriental Languages Interpreters of the King of Spain, with special reference to Miguel Casiri.\n\nThis text looks at the fluid intersection in the emergence and development of Zionism and the later Zionist-promoted emigration of Moroccan Jews to Israel from what was the Spanish Protectorate zone in Morocco and the Spanish enclaves of Ceuta and Melilla in the north of Sherifian state. This process has received less attention from scholars than similar events in the French zone. However, it has some particularities that merit specific attention. From the early years of contact between North Moroccan Jews and European Zionism, the strong cultural identity of the Sephardim in the region and the mobilization of a Spanish approach informed by philo-Sephardism marked an important difference with regard to the French zone in the reception of Zionism and the organization of emigration to Israel. Paradoxically, in the Spanish protectorate, such process resulted in the disappearance of important historic Sephardic centers like Tetouan, Larache, and Ksar-el-Kebir.\n\nThis essay analyzes the travel account authored by Moroccan ambassador Muhammad al-Ghass^ an^ ı, who visited Spain in 1690 –91. The account shows the evolution of the early modern frontier between Christian Europe and Islamic North Africa, from a militarized boundary to the development of diplomatic relations. Both an agent and witness of that history, al-Ghass^ an^ ı describes a heterogeneous space: he surveys the border, explores the foreign land of modern Spain, and reimagines the memory of al-Andalus. His important account, based on sharp observation and serious research, helps nuance the prevailing view that Arab culture had ignored Europe before the nineteenth century.\n\nThe ‘War of Africa’/‘War of Tetouan’ (1859-60) and the subsequent Spanish occupation of Tetouan (1860-62) have commonly been considered a historical landmark signaling the end of Morocco’s independence. While it is hardly arguable that Spain consolidated its position in Morocco throughout the second half of the nineteenth century thanks to the favorable conditions established in the treaties that followed the end of the war, the goal of this article is to nuance the reification of the power of the colonizers and the powerlessness of the colonized that many historiographical narratives have purported. I will analyze the political change that took place among the Spaniards who were on the ground during the initial stage of the occupation of Tetouan. Despite mainly relying on Spanish sources, I will also highlight the ways in which Moroccan diplomacy, the city’s inhabitants, and local practices shaped this transformation by creating anxieties that permeated the Spanish colonization. I argue that the Spaniards on the ground increasingly empathized with – and even admired – the local population, and consequently constructed notions of Hispano-Moroccan similarity. This colonial mimesis went hand in hand with the perception of Moroccans as unyielding, which ultimately led the Spanish to admit the difficulty, even impossibility, of their colonialist venture.\n\nThe sponsorship of pilgrimage to Mecca by European colonial powers in the 19 th and 20 th centuries contributed to transforming the hajj into the global phenomenon it is today. Spain also promoted Muslim pilgrimage from its zone of the Moroccan Protectorate, tentatively at first, and then more purposefully from 1937 onwards, continuing its sponsorship into the early 1970s, years after Morocco's independence. Intensive study of administrative documentation from the Spanish Protectorate allows the reformulation of the sponsorship's established chronology (from 1937 to 1956). It also shows the dual intent concealed behind its promotion: first, as propaganda aimed at the interior of the Moroccan territory being administered; and second, as a tool for the external promotion of a political regime in need of support to escape its international isolation. The pilgrimage's sponsorship is seen as part of the general framework of managing Muslim rituals enacted by the Spanish government to deactivate their potential mobilising capacity."
