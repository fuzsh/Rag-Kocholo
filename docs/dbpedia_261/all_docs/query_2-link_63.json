Gramstad\n\ngenealogy search\n\nMy father, Ross (Rasmus) Gramstad immigrated to the USA from Sandas, Norway. He landed in Quebec, Canada on the Empress of Ireland. This was sometime between 1895 & 1910. He was 17 yrs old at the time. We can not find any passenger lists of Nowegians that came to Canada on this ship nor any information on the Empress of Ireland.\n\nI have tried various contacts here in the USA. they suggested we check the Canadian records.\n\nWould deeply appreciate any information you can provide us.\n\nHarold\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nDec. 25\n\nFrom: Paul Arnkvarn\n\nThank you.....\n\nMy father died some years ago and though he was very reluctant to relay to us his wartime experiences he would at times mention a breakout he was part of from Goteborg to the UK. We never got hold of many of the details but we understood enough to know that it was a dramatic and traumatic experience for him. I happened upon your account of the operation and sure enough there listed on the crew of BP Newton is one Bjorn Arnkvaern, galleyboy. Needless to say, it was an emotional discovery for christmas day! I am saving the story for my young son whom will never have the experience of meeting this extraordinary man; but it is my hope that one day he will read this story about his iron-willed grandfather experiences and learn something about his roots and himself.\n\nTusen takk!\n\nPaul Arnkvarn\n\nMontreal Canada\n\nps. any other information you might have re. Bjorn Arnkvaern would be greatly appreciated. We know that he joined up with the Norwegian Air Force in Scotland (Squadron 333, i believe)\n\nPaul is referring to the text found in Kvarstad Ships & Men\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nDec. 25\n\nFrom: Sergei Vonmiglasov\n\nInteresting indeed.\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nDec. 23\n\nFrom: Michael Remme\n\nOle Jacob\n\nYou asked about information on the crew of the Ole Jacob. My uncle, Ola Remme was an oiler on that ship. He told me that when the crew was brought to Japan, the Japanese, then neutral, gave them the option of returning to occupied Norway or eventually arranging transport to an allied port. Those who opted to return to Norway were instead kept in Japan for the duration of the war. Ola opted for transport to an allied port, but the Germans required him to sign a document stating that he would not take up arms against Germany for the duration of the war. (in other words, he gave his parole). He made it to Hong Kong, then Canada where he joined the Norwegian Navy and was trained at Lunenburg in Nova Scotia. He served in the Norwegian navy until the navy somehow discovered he had given his parole, and told him he had to resign or risk execution should he be captured by the Germans. He then finished the war in the Norwegian merchant marine. He had married a Canadian woman and settled in Canada after the war where he was principally involved in restoring the fortress at Halifax. He died two years ago. My father was Kaare Remme, who was torpedoed on the Skotland on May 17, 4002 by a German submarine (Capt Vogel) outside the bay of Fundy. My uncle, Trygve Remme is one of the two bosun mates piping King Haakon VII off the Stord in a famous photograph taken when he returned to Norway at the end of the war. I had the pleasure of serving in Norway as an officer with the United States Marines and had my photograph in the newspaper standing next to King Olav during Teamwork 80 exercises in the fall of 1980. Your web site is great. Keep up the good work. Ha det bra! Michael Remme\n\n(My question with regard to the prisonrs of Ole Jacob can be found in the text under that ship on the page \"Norwegian Victims of Atlantis\").\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nDec. 17\n\nFrom: Dmitri Vagliano (Vallianos)\n\nneed your help\n\nDear Sir!\n\nI found this message in your guestbook:\n\n\"Saturday, July 7, 2001.\n\nFrom: Athanassios Akrivos\n\nRingulv-Lyngenfjord\n\nHello Siri, i came by your very interesting site while searching for information on my familys ships. The original owner of the Ringulv, A.S Vagliano was my grandfather, Keramiai is the name of his village of origin in the island of Kefalonia. I contacted mr. Setsaa who was kind enough to send me a clear scan of his picture, but now i see an even better one from the time it was called Lyngenfjord. Could you let me know were you found it?\"\n\nMy grandfather, S.V. Vallianos (Vagliano) was shipowner from Keramie (Kefalonia) too.\n\nThat's why I want to find a contact of Mr. Athanassios Akrivos.\n\nUnfortunately, you cut all e-mails from you guestbook. Please, send me his e-mail if it's possible.\n\nGreat thanks!\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nDec. 17\n\nFrom: John Beaber\n\nThanks\n\nMessage: Thanks for a very well designed website. I really enjoyed my visit. Also thanks for linking to my webpage on your \"Life in Imprisonment\" page . http://ithascome.bravehost.com/index.html\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nDec. 9\n\nFrom: Dr. Axel Niestlé\n\nS/S Jamaica sunk by U 221\n\nDear Mrs Lawson,\n\nWhile tracking down information on merchant sailors taken POW by German U-boats during WWII I came across the sinking of the Jamaica on 7 March 1943. According to the war diary of U 221, the 4th Engineer was picked up from the sea and taken prisoner after the ship had gone down. No other information about the identity of the prisoner is given. However, the war diary also notes that said prisoner jumped overboard on 21 March 1943 at 2215 while in square BD 3271. The entry on this incident reads as follows (my translation):\n\n2215 General quarters for excercise. The captured Englishman [sic] has the believe that we are actually about to attack a destroyer and jumps into the water after I had him brought up on the bridge to get some fresh air. He had already expressed this intention previously several times.\n\n2231 Crash-diving for excercise\n\n2248 Surfaced.\n\nFrom your information on the sinking I am aware that the 4th Engineer Officer was obviously rescued together with the other survivors. However, if the person taken aboard U 221 was in fact a British national, he must have been one of the two radio operator mentioned by you which were recorded as lost. I really would like to identify this man positively. Therefore I wonder if you could give me any further advice on this matter.\n\nsincerely yours\n\nDr. Axel Niestlé\n\nPS: wonderful website\n\nDr. Niestlé is referring to the info found in my text for Jamaica. This is the first time I've ever heard mention of anyone remaining aboard the U-boat as prisoner. It would be interesting to get this cleared up, and I will try to do so.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nDec. 5\n\nFrom: Kathlleen Snider\n\nConvoy HX 223\n\nI found the web site very educational.\n\nMy father served aboard the SS Pan Maryland in Convoy HX 223. I remember him talking about seeing the ship, Kollbjorg, as she broke apart in hurricane force winds during Jan. 1942. The SS Pan Maryland picked up some of the survivors. I am interested in finding out anything else about that convoy.\n\nThanks,\n\nKathee Snider\n\nHere is my info for Convoy HX 223, on that page there's a link to Kollbjørg, which is listed here. In the text for Kollbjørg there's a link to Eric Bissmire's page about this convoy, which has some more details. This is all I can provide, if I had more, it would already be included in my text. The local library might be able to suggest some books that has info on this convoy (usually, books about the American Navy at war, and books about U-boats have plenty of convoy information).\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nDec. 3\n\nFrom: Jos Odijk\n\nShip the \"Botne\" period 19.8.40 to 14.1.41\n\nThank you for puting so much info on the internet about the convoy period. It will help me to find more about an uncle of mine who died as a sailor on board of a convoy ship (I'm not sure which ship)\n\nI found out my Uncle N.C. Odijk has sailed on the Botne (in his papers was mentioned Botni) a Norwegian ship in the period 19.8.40 untill 14.1.41.\n\nHow can I found out what voyages this ship made in this period (was the ship involved in convoys at that time) and where could I find a picture of the ship.\n\nAccording to registrations he later (4.2.41)went to the Dutch ship Spar, and left the ship on the 16.3.42 for a ship from Panama, which did the convoy from Halifax to Archangel (Moermansk)\n\nOdijk his corpse washed ashore in Norway and was buried in Tufjord 17.5.42\n\nGreetings Jos Odijk\n\nfrom the Netherlands.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nDec. 1\n\nFrom: Jean Hulbert\n\nT.H. KVILHAUG\n\nTHANK YOU FOR GETTING BACK TO ME SO FAST. I HAVE A FRIEND WHO HAS TWO PAINTINGS THAT ARE SIGNED \"T.H. KVILHAUG\". SHE SAYS THEY ARE ABOUT 200 YEARS OLD. HER MOTHER BROUGHT THEM OVER FROM NORWAY. IS KVILHAUG NORWEGIAN? WE WERE HOPING THAT BECAUSE OF YOUR WEB SIGHT THAT YOUR FAMILY HISTORY MIGHT KNOW OF THIS PAINTER/ARTIST. I AM NEW TO COMPUTERS AND THE INTERNET SO I DON'T HAVE KNOWLEDGE OF HOW TO GO ABOUT LOOKING FOR THIS PERSON. IF HE OR SHE IS NOT FROM NORWAY THEN I WONDER WHERE HE OR SHE IS FROM. THE PAINTINGS ARE IN GOOD SHAPE--ONE IS A SNOW SCENE AND THE OTHER IS A SUMMER SCENE. MY FRIEND IS GETTING ON IN YEARS AND WOULD LIKE TO SELL THESE PAINTINGS. I THANK YOU AGAIN FOR YOUR QUICK REPLY.

ANYTHING YOU COULD SUPPLY WOULD BE GREATLY APPRECIATED.\n\nI'm unable to help with this\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nNov. 29\n\nFrom: Linda\n\nLiberty ships\n\nI am trying to find some information on a Norwegian liberty ship that my father (from St. Cloud, Minnesota) was on during WWII. I have pictures of this ship and shipmates but all he ever wrote on the back was first names or nicknames of these people and then Panama Express. Which I think was just a nick name for it. I am told by my mother that it was a Norwegian liberty ship and that there was only about 4 Americans on this ship and that they were the gunners. It was in the Australian area as he kept a log of the dates and ports that he put in on such as: Milne Bay, Oro Bay, Sidney from April 3rd and on. Any help would be appreciated. I can also scan in the pictures and e-mail them to anybody who can help. My father past away 1 year ago this month and never finished his scrapbook and now I am trying to piece it together so that my 2 daughters can remember him.\n\n(I do have a Panama Express listed on my website, but she was not a former Liberty Ship).\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nNov. 27\n\nFrom: H Balzac\n\nGreat reading\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nNov. 26\n\nFrom: Kaare Seeberg Sidselrud\n\nCaptain on M/V Lidvard\n\nHello Siri,\n\nIt's interesting to see your site develop so I pop in from time to time. Keep up the good work. I have an answer and a question for Greg Fromyhr in Australia.\n\nMy father, Kaare Sidselrud, became Captain of M/V Lidvard at New Year time 1941/42 when Captain Nicolai Lindtner went ashore. My father served as captain throughout the war and way into 1946. M/V Lidvard was leased from NORTRASHIP to the Australian Army Transport Corps very soon after the escape from Dakar. He died in 1979 and was awarded The Norwegian War Medal in 1942 and Haakon VII Liberty Medal post mortem in 1988, as well as the 1939-45 Star, Atlantic Star, Pacific Star and War Medal 1939-1945 post mortem from Great Britain in 2002.\n\nI have to check my fathers papers on where Lidvard was in action at the time Thoralf Frømyhr was on board to be able to give an educated guess about the Kings Medal and a possible connection to Lidvard. I know that my father recommended that some of the crew should be awarded medals, but nothing more than that, and of course most of his fellow captains and himself refused to apply for permission to receive medals for themselves.\n\nBack to Thoralf Frømyhr's medal. I need to know whether it is the British og Norwegian Kings Medal, the name of the medal if possible or at least the colours on the medal ribbon in order to give a more complete answer.\n\nRegards,\n\nKaare Seeberg Sidselrud\n\nOslo, Norway\n\nKaare is referring to Greg Fromyhr's message from March 6-2002. See also my page about Lidvard.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nNov. 26\n\nFrom: Catherine Loveday\n\nJohn P Pedersen HX126\n\nMessage: I have just read with interest the information which you have relating to the sinking of the John P Pedersen, my Father was the British Gunner, Stanley Chapman, who died with the ship on May 20 1941. I should greatly appreciate contacting any survivors or relatives of those serving on the John p Pedersen, It was my Father's first voyage at age 28 and I have so little knowledge or information relating to his time spend serving in the war. He was transfedrred from the Ox nad Bucks regiment to the newly formed Maritime Royal Artillery just before the ship sailed with the HX 126 concoy on May 10. The remains on the motley assortment of ships in the HX 126 crossed the path of the Bismark before she was sank on May 27 1941.\n\nIf anyone had relatives on John P. Pedersen and would like to contact Catherine, please let me know and I'll put you in touch. See also the Guestbook message from the Radio Operator's son.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nNov. 24\n\nFrom: Neill McClarence\n\nSS Deptford\n\nI thank you for the information I have found on the site.\n\nA small correction may be required, I believe the Deptford was sunk by U-38 not U109\n\n\"British steamer, 4,101 gross tons, torpedoed off Honningsvaag, N Norway, sunk by German submarine U-38 (commanded by Heinrich Liebe). Attacked around 1528 hours German time on 13th December 1939.\" (\"Axis Submarine Successes of WW2\" by Rohwer)\n\nAlso this is an extract I found relating the post war Trials.\n\nAt all events, such was the pattern laid down by Raeder and followed by Donitz. From the very first the Naval War Staff never had any intention of observing the laws of war at sea. The defence that the sinking of Allied merchant ships without warning was justified by Allied measures is as untenable as the suggestion that the sinking at sight of neutral merchant ships was preceded by warning which complied with the requirements of International Law.\n\nYou have seen the very vague and general warnings given to the neutrals and the memorandum of the Naval War Staff revealing that these were deliberately given in the most general terms because Raeder knew that the action he intended against neutrals was utterly illegal. I need not remind you of the document which suggests that orders should be given by word of mouth and a false entry made in the log book, the very practice followed in the case of the Athenia, or of the entries in Raeder's own war diary revealing that carefully selected neutrals should be sunk wherever the use of electric torpedoes might enable the Germans to maintain that the ship had really struck a mine.\n\nYou have confirmation in the bland denials prepared by Raeder to answer the protests of the Norwegian and Greek Governments on the sinking of the Thomas Walton and the Garoufalia, and the reluctant admission in the case of the Deptford, all three ships sunk in December, 1939, by the same U-boat.\n\nNothing reveals more of the cynicism or opportunism with which Raeder and Donitz treated International Law than the contrast between their attitude towards the sinking of a Spanish ship in 1940 and that of September, 1942. In 1940 Spain did not matter to Germany; in 1942 she did.\n\nhttp://www.nizkor.org/hweb/imt/tgmwc/tgmwc-19/tgmwc-19-188-02.shtml\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nNov. 20\n\nFrom: Karin Fossum Denton\n\nI live in Denton Texas and was raised as an American but I was born in Sarpsborg in 1952 to Norwegian parents.

Though he didn't include any information about your site, it didn't take me long to find it. I noticed that you also have a link to 'holmtun.no'. Thanks for the flowers.\n\n'Holmtun' is being offered for sale, as I can no longer justify our ownership of the vessel. It is my hope that someone who has a heart for this kind of ship, to carry the torch further. One can never hope to realize the investment of dedication to such a task of restoration, but I hope I can have the satisfaction of preserving a piece of Norway's history. There is an ad currently running in 'Båtbørsen'.\n\nIt was a pleasant surprise to find us on your web page.\n\nMy text for Hølefjord I can be found here.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nOct. 27\n\nFrom: Dianne Gowing\n\nMy grandfather\n\nI wanted to thank you for the information I found on your website regarding my grandfather, Andrew O'Dea. He served and died aboard the Havtor, which was torpedoed and sunk 6/11/41. My mothers family had no other information/confirmation than this website of any details of his death. I had always heard that he had gottn stuck in a porthole, and went down with his ship. It does not mention his name in the story, but it had to be him. ANY information about him, or the events of that day, would be appreciated. My mother and her remaining family would maybe be able move past the questions they have had all their life regarding their father. Thank you so much.\n\n(Havtor is discussed here).\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nOct. 25\n\nFrom: Craig Mesman\n\nHallfried\n\nDear Siri,\n\nI have met a man named Karl Hansen, who lives in Loleta, California, USA. He is in his 80's and is still a house painter! He told me the other day about his being a sole survivor aboard the Hallfried. He said it was struck by 2 torpedoes on October 31, 1943. He said that all Norwegians are poets, and he recited a lengthy poem that he wrote 5 years after the sinking. It was a great poem! I found your website, and the information about the Hallfried, but it states that there were 3 survivors. I'm pretty sure that Karl made it sound like he was the sole survivor of the incident, but maybe he meant the \"sole surviving survivor\". I don't know. He also said that it was an Italian U-boat that attacked them. I would appreciate hearing from you, and I would be glad to put you in touch with Karl if you would like.\n\nThank you, Craig Mesman.\n\n(My info for Hallfried can be found on the Ships starting with H page).\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nOct. 23\n\nFrom: Eric DUPRE\n\nIt is a very important note\n\nMessage: Hi,\n\nI am Eric DUPRE and I am studying the Norwegian cargo-boat which had been sank in Atlantic along the south-west coast of France between San Sebastian and Bordeaux during the WW1.\n\nI look for the technic characteristics (length, weight...) and pictures of these boats and their crews.

This is kind of sketchy, and based on information with in this letter.\n\nHis name was John Francis Boyle but the name was a surname given to him when he joined the Norweigian Merchant Marines at age 14. He was orginally from Spain and rec'vd British Citizenship. He was born Oct 31 1921 or 22.\n\nHe worked on tankers and freighters. He was mostly on a German oil tanker named Birkenstock or something. He was sunk several times on other ships, and rec'vd a medal for saving his ship from an incoming torpedo.\n\nHe was tried in NY eventually for something relating to mutiny. He was ordered back on a ship and he jumped ship on the way out of port and never went back. He stayed in the US from then on.\n\nI would like to find more info about the ships he was on, the awards he rec'vd, and specifically what he had to do to provide documents to rec'vd British subject status. We have no family history on him and these things might help. Could you point me in the right direction? I was told he contracted Malaria from a tour to Africa. Don't know if that will help any.\n\nThanks, Nikaela\n\nPlease note that, as much as I'd like to help, I'm usually unable to assist with queries such as these. All I can do is suggest misc. archives within the country in question. For instance, if the person served on a Norwegian ship, the National Archives in Norway might be able to help (address is provided at the end of the \"front\" page of my ship lists). If the person is mentioned in a crew list on this website, he can be found by adding his name to my search engine (it'll be noticed, that O. A Knudsen had a seaman by the name John Boyle).\n\nAlso, I very often get requests for help in finding people, but again, I'm simply not able to help with such requests.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nOct. 7\n\nFrom:: Jack Stapleton\n\nI am an old sailor sailed on Can. ships 2nd world war\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nOct. 6\n\nFrom: Annetta C.

From July 1966 to March 1967 I served on board the M.T. Tore Knudsen which was registered in Haugesund. Do you have any knowledge of her after this time. I would dearly love a photo of her,as I have so many good memories of my time on board.I have tried contacting the owners Knut Knutsen on a few occasions but alas, my requests remain unanswered.\n\nYours sincerely\n\nFrank McNabola\n\nTyne&Wear (U.K.)\n\nThis ship was sold in Apr.-1974 to Lefkaritis Brothers Marine Ltd., Limassol and renamed Petrolina I. Broken up around 1983.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nSept. 23\n\nFrom: Alexander Ellinson\n\nGrandfather search\n\nMy grandfather was a merchant mariner lost at sea, Chief Steward with the Bateau on the Murmansk run, 3/29/42. His name was Alexander Ellinson (the same as me). There were five survivors out of a crew of forty. I know the Bateau was sunk by a destroyer Z-26. I would appreciate any information/pictures/of the time. I understand there was a survivor from Montreal - a Mr. Edward Suchanko - do you have any information regarding this gentleman or his whereabouts.\n\nWith thanks\n\nAlexander Ellinson\n\nI suggested looking through my Guestbook where there are several messages from the descendants of another crew member of this ship. Also, Bateau came up on my Ship Forum http://warsailors.com/forum/list.php?1 at some point, there was information on a book written about this ship, and a couple of very useful links. Use the search feature on the forum to find it, with Bateau as keyword. I also suggested leaving a message on my Find Old Shipmates forum or contacting Maureen Venzi at http://members.tripod.com/%7emerchantships/index.html. Bateau is also mentioned on my Arctic Convoys page http://www.warsailors.com/convoys/arctic.html\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nSept. 23\n\nFrom: Staffan Storteir\n\nOLYMPIA ex PRIMO\n\nThere is an image of S/S OLYMPIA at ´m/aux GUSTAF the 3-m iron-hulled barque ELISSA under the Finnish Flag´ http://sydaby.eget.net/swe/elissa.htm. There was information about this ship in the unpublished manuscripts compiled by Pehr Molander which I read some years ago, but the interest was focused on Gustaf ex Elissa so I don't remember more about this vessel than the short note that can be read at the web page.\n\nRegards,\n\nStaffan\n\nhttp://sydaby.eget.net/swe/emi_intro.htm\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nSept. 20\n\nFrom: Tim Hillier\n\nThanks\n\nHi Siri,\n\nI just wanted to express my personal thanks to you for setting up your website - it has proved absolutely invaluable to me in my researches regarding the ships my dear and sadly missed Father served on during WW2. I don't know where else I could have found out so much information so quickly to help me along, from such a wonderful knowledgeable bunch of people - superb!\n\nI have a lot more research to carry out and I know I can always rely on gleaning a lot of information from here...re other ships that Dad served with, such as convoy details and really just about anything. I have been in touch with the old owners of a Norwegian ship that Dad served on and they sent me a copy of their history which has various references to it, thanks to you!! Keep up the good work - it is much appreciated!\n\nKindest Regards\n\nTim Hillier\n\nEngland\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nSept. 19\n\nFrom: Jennifer\n\nNYLEN\n\nHello. I am sorry to bother you. I am looking to locate family in Norway. My Great Grandfather came to America on a boat his Family sent him on because it was said they wanted to protect him- and send him to America. The family owned many boats in Norway- The name was NYLEN, Harald / HARRY Nylen. If anyone has any info, on what sound very common- please email me.

My father was in the Australian Merchant Navy in WW2. I have only just come across information that he served on a ship called Pegasus that was torpedoed and he was picked up by a Dutch submarine, he was one of only 3 survivors in a lifeboat and had been adrift for about 24 days or so. I can not find the name of the ship or any details about where, when, or how he came to be on this ship.\n\nHis name was 'Leslie James Seymour' but he was always called 'Lars' and that is my middle name, and he could speak Norweign but he died in 1958.\n\nIf you or anyone is able to able to help me on this matter please let me know.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nSept. 11\n\nFrom: Richard Goold\n\nNorwegian voting\n\nThis isn't a Warsailors subject but I have tried everything I know for the information but come up with nothing. Norway has a system of proportional representation in electing the Storting. As we in British Columbia are presently considering a change to our system of voting, I would like to find out how the Norwegian system works. I cannot find a detailed explanation on the Norwegian govt. websites. If you could help me on this I would greatly apreciate it.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nSept. 11\n\nFrom: Claire\n\nVery interesting site\n\nThis is a really interesting site.

Now not just for you, but for all visitors here to read.\n\nAs to the subject as stated above.\n\nI am planning to launch a water-related website. This will contain mainly pages about naval history, (world) explorations, sailing and so on, since I'm quite a passionate sailor myself. Other topics might be everything from Atlantis to Waterfalls, as long as it's got something to do with the theme 'Water'.\n\nSo here's my cry for help. I'm doing (amongst others) a page on Colin Archer. A name which is probably well-known to the majority of visitors here. Well at the least the Norwegian ones. I was able to find some Colin Archer info on the web, but these pages all seem to state the same things and talk about the same boats. The Venus, the Fram (of course), the Minnie, the Thor and the RS-1.\n\nWhat I want to do is put up whatever I can find on OTHER Colin Archer boats, such as the Heijmen (sailed by Connie van Rietschoten) or the Storegut (Wilhelm Wolf). All information and pictures (if free to use) on ALL Colin Archer boats is welcome.\n\nFor those of you who got curious about my website, the url is http://www.croco.nl/ but beware, there'll be (hardly) anything there untill October 15th.\n\nAll of you who might have any info, you can always contact me through my website. For future references, my site will include a search box so if the Colin Archer story is online, you can always find it through my search page.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nAug. 30\n\nFrom: Mogens Rasmussen\n\nM/V Primo/Oslo\n\nHej Siri\n\nI´m Danish and now retired, what gives me time to enter my old things im my trunks. I´ve found some pictures from 1955/56. I´ve found out, that a picture of a steamer named OLYMPIA is the former PRIMO. Looking at your always facinating forum for the WW2 questions, I can se you have only a litte about that ship. I have a LR from 1944/45 saying that the ship was built 1930 at Smith´s Dock, Middelsbro´, 1840 BRT, 265,4 feet and homeport Oslo. Manager was A/S Pavo - Kjell Brunsgaard. I found the steamer again in Norske Veritas 1956 named OLYMPIA, where it has nearly the same data. There must have been some kind of rebuilding in the years between. Same page said that the engine only vas NHK 181. It must have been a very hazard job to enter ports in bad weather. In my time at sea we found that 1 HP for 1 TDW was suitable. The owner was now O/Y Thelmia A/B, Sideby (P. Molander, Bjørneborg). I dont know how to put -.JPG files in to this form, so let me know if you are interested in 2 pics from my young days (15 years old) in the town of Rønne in Bornholm. Today we make sharper pictures, but they have a reasonable standard. I can also give you scans of LR and Veritas if interested. And besides: I also don´t know if this is the right way to give this informations. Anyway: I run over your site several times every week, because it have a high standard.\n\nBest regards\n\nMogens\n\nPrimo can be found here.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nAug. 25\n\nFrom: Bjorn\n\nRavnanger\n\nI'm trying to find out about my grandfather Oscar Larsen who might have been serving on this ship and others during WWII. He was born on June the 20th 1905 and emigrated from Norway in May/June 1923. Any information would be greatly appreciated.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nAug. 24\n\nFrom: Gabe Thomas\n\nMilag\n\nDelighted to see you making use of any information I have available. Especially pleased that you are able to correct some mistakes. Our book is now out of print but I can email extracts if anyone wants information.\n\nGabe must be referring to some details I've added to the 2nd page of my Kvarstad Ships & Men section, with regard to those who were taken prisoners. He sent me some information a while back.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nAug. 24\n\nFrom: Geoff Collier\n\nRussian Convoy Medal British Sailors.\n\nMy brother-in-law, Petty Officer Albert Eaves, No.JX142448 was serving on the minesweeper HMS Bramble when it was sunk on 31st.December 1942 whilst escorting Convoy JW-518 taking supplies to Russia. The vessel was sunk by the German cruiser 'Admiral Hipper' in the Berents Sea. I understand there is a medal issued by Russia to which he is entitled and I would like to apply for same on behalf of his son and grandchildren. Can you please inform me how to go about it, and oblige.\n\nKind Regards, Geoff Collier.\n\n(ex-RAF Bomber Command WW11)\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nAug. 19\n\nFrom: Asbjørn Olsen Kårvik\n\nPicture of M/T Norsol\n\nI have a picture of m/t Norsol and m/t America which I have found in my fathers photoalbum. Do you have any interest of these for your picture arcive?\n\nThank you so much - yes, I'd be very interested, but when I tried to tell you so by using the E-mail address you have given, my mail came back as undeliverable.\n\nIf you see this Asbjørn, please contact me again.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nAug 18\n\nFrom: Donald Lowe\n\nSeeking info\n\nI am looking for a Merchant marine lost on a ship out of Halifax N.S. His name is Roger Gallaway Smith of Necum Teuch Hfx. Co. N.S. Don't know the name of the ship he was on but think it was about 1944. Where could I find information on this?\n\nThank you,\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nAug. 18\n\nFrom: Paul Giltz\n\nPhotos, Norwegian,WW2\n\nI visited you site and enjoyed it very much, I've started an interest in steamships and freighters of the interwar era. I found an interesting web site run by the University of Virginia. They hold a collection of over 3,000 photos that were taken by the US Army Signal Corps at Norfolk Virginia during WW2.These photos show an amazing variety of ships being loaded for the invasions of Africa and Europe.\n\nI ran a search for \"Norwegian\" and came up with 4 listings.\n\n2 photos of loading activity on the deck of the SS BRAGA\n\n1 photo of Captain Erling Kristensen on the bridge of the Norwegian tanker THORSHOLM.\n\n1 photo of a \"no smoking\" sign on the THORSHOLM.\n\nThe site has many photos showing how cargo was loaded and stowed, both on deck and in the holds. I myself had no idea how complicated it was back then.\n\nTake a look at- www.lva.lib.usa/whoweare/exhibits/treasures/arts/art-m12.htm\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nAug. 16-2003\n\nFrom: Ernest Gay\n\nShips & Mariners\n\nSiri, this is the second time I have visited your site today. There is still a lot of day left and I may well visit it another 2 times. But I will certainly keep on visiting it until I have seen everything it has to offer, more than once. You are a man after my own heart, except, as much as I would like to do what you are doing, I lack the ability. Full marks to you for acquiring that ability and using it, selflessly, to create such an informative and considerate rendezvous for information seekers. You must have devoted a lot of time and love in creating this site and, even if it does seem unappreciated by some, at times, the vast majority of visitors owe you a debt of gratitude for all the trouble you have gone to on their behalf.\n\nUntil next time, \"bon voyage\".\n\nErnie Gay.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nAug. 3-2003\n\nFrom Frank H Muirhead\n\nS S Bosphorus\n\nIn 1948 the Cromer Lifeboat launched on service to the above vessel off the Norfolk Coast. I have had an enquiry regarding the vessel which was carrying a cargo of Oranges, the first I believe to be imported after the War. If any one can supply me with any details of the vessel, crew or any other interesting items I would be grateful.\n\nFrank H Muirhead, Cromer Lifeboat Historian and Hon Curator, Henry Blogg Museum.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nAug. 2\n\nFrom: David Winterbottom\n\nHMS Hardy\n\nI am researching the details of a friends Uncle who died on 30/1/44 on the Destroyer R08 HMS Hardy. His Uncle was one of the ship telegraphists and the ship was escorting convoy JW 56B. I notice there are no details of this on the Arctic Convoy list and would be grateful if you could advise any information please.\n\nMany thanks\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nJuly 23-2003\n\nFrom Andy Skarstein\n\nHi Siri\n\nWhat a site ! It's impressive what you have put together, and thanks for doing so much in English for us (inc those of Norwegian descent like me) who don't speak Norwegian.\n\nPerhaps my father knew yours ? His name is EILIV, he is originally from Harstad, later Bergen. He was at the London Radio School at about the same time, not sure exactly when. He always referred to the location as Atkins Road (which is just around the corner from Clarence Avenue).\n\nI can't ask him for more details at the moment as he is somewhere in Norway, not sure where, for a few weeks visiting family and friends, driving himself around at the ripe old age of 82!\n\nI believe he was on the first ship into Kirkenes after the end of the war, I think on \"Kronprinsen\". I will try to get some more info from him when he comes back and send it to you. Keep up the great work ...\n\nAndy Skarstein (West Sussex, UK)\n\nAndy's father escaped from Norway on Laugen in 1941.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nJuly 4-2003\n\nFrom: Marek Twardowski\n\nConvoy HX-174\n\nHello,\n\nI am just thumbing through your convoy list and perhaps it mauy be of interest that Polish LECHISTAN was late for convoy HX-174. She left Halifax on 7.02 at 1035 hrs and had to chase the convoy and joined it only on 11.02.\n\nConvoy HX-203 ran into thick fog and some ships were lost on 17.08; they joined the convoy only on 19.08.\n\nSTALOWA WOLA did not sail in ON-92 due to engine trouble. Please note you have her listed as STALOWA POLA (incorrectly).\n\nPolish ship in SC-67 could possibly be WISLA - the departure and arrival dates agree.\n\nBest wishes,\n\nMarek\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nJuly 2-2003\n\nFrom: Mae\n\nMV- Ora\n\nHi, I work for the royal Norwegian Consulate in Brisbane. I was contacted for information regarding a Nortraship called the MV Ora. During the period 1943-1944. I would really appreciate some assistance in finding information and a picture. The person who contacted me was a worker on the ship and would really love a picture. If you could forward me to any relevant websites that would be appreciated.Regards, Mae\n\nOra can be found on my O-page.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nJune 1-2003\n\nFrom: Tuomo Paasi\n\ns.s. Haraldsvang\n\nDear sir,\n\nMy late uncle Urho Paasi served as mate (as far as I know) on board S.S. Haraldsvang (later Toryu Maru, Japanese) in 1942 from St. Thomas, the Karibbeans to Far East, and finally in Hong Kong, where the ship was interned in December 1942. I know quite much of my uncle´s later history, but I´d like to write the story of this seafarer for my family, and for that purpose it could be very interesting to have of a picture of this vessel. Do you have any possibility to find the picture?\n\nS.S Haraldsvang was owned by H.M. Wrangell & co A/S Haugesund.\n\nPlease answer, and I hope, send the picture,\n\nto\n\nTuomo Paasi\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nJune 27\n\nFrom: Wes Injerd\n\nFukuoka POW Camp #1\n\nHi!\n\nI've visited your site before and note that my website info needs updated. The link you give is just fine and works OK. You can correct the spelling of the camp that Karl Hjalmar Hansen was in as Fukuoka. Same goes for info re the M/T Scotia.\n\nIt's great to know more about this Norwegian who was in Fukuoka. Would you have any contact info in Norway on him? I am half-Norwegian.\n\nThanks.\n\nWes\n\nhttp://www2.gol.com/users/winjerd/Pwcmp1_a.htm\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nJune 25\n\nFrom: Michael Russo\n\nJust to say hello.\n\nI was born after the War so I have no stories to tell. I have been \"abord ship\" and have an oilers rateing. So you can guess that I've heard a few war tails, since they are not my own I'll not repete them. I could only do an injustice to them if I tried.\n\nI will mention one man's name with whom I worked Mr. Milton Hymes. He ran away from home to go to sea when he was fifteen but later came home finished school and as agreed with his Father joined the U.S. Navy. He later found his way into the newly formed Submarine branch and was told that...\" it wouldn't last long but to give it a try.\" It lasted more than a while and thirty five years later he retired and came back to N.Y. to work on the Staten Island Ferries.\n\nThere's lots more but what I really have to say is how wonderful your site is and how important also. Today dedication and entegrity have become dirty words to a lot of people. Your respect as shown here demands respect from any who come to this site. It is a fine memorial for Merchant Seaman and all Seaman.\n\nGreat work!\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nJune 22\n\nFrom: Astrid Stephen\n\nHoegh Silverdawn\n\nI was Amazed to see Picture of the survivors of the Hoegh Silverdawn and recognised my Father Rolf Anker Guldberg.\n\nI knew he had served on a merchant ship that was sunk but did not know the name of the ship or the location of the incident,\n\nanyway thanks.\n\nAstrid\n\nHøegh Silverdawn and the picture referred to here can be found on my page Norwegian Victims of Michel\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nJune 22\n\nFrom: Bob Irvine\n\nON-62\n\nHello,\n\nI was trying to find out more about convoy ON-62. My grandfather was Chief Steward on board the Biela when she was torpedoed and sunk by U-98 on Feb, 15, 1942. She was attached to ON-62, but sailing independently from Liverpool to Buenos Aires with general cargo. She was dispersed from the convoy and turned south at about 200 miles SE of Cape Race. 400 Miles SW of Cape Race at position 42.55N 45.40W she was attacked and lost with all hands (U-98-Robert Gysae)\n\nRegards\n\nBob Irvine\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nJune 21-2003\n\nFrom: Frank James\n\nSinking of the Vardaas\n\nHi ! Just been looking at your site with interest. What an immense amount of research !\n\nWould you like more on the sinking of the `Vardaas` in WW2 ? I`ve been researching U564 and Teddy Suhren, and can let you have a transcript and/or English translation of U564`s original log of the event (which includes details of the final sinking) - and I could even let you have a scan of a photocopy of the ship on fire, from a photo in the late Leading Engineer`s (Gabler - U564) photo-album.\n\nBest regards\n\nPS. I would be interested to learn a little more about the period at and immediately after the end of the war in Norway as a whole. (Suhren was i/c Norwegian U-boats for the latter part of the war, and was interned at the end.). Any links to sites would be welcome.\n\nVardaas can be found here.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nJune 20\n\nFrom: Ralph Arnesen\n\nMy father was a krigseiler and is still alive at 94. I am sure he will appreciate your efforts.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nJune 17\n\nFrom: Cyril Lofthus\n\nE-mail: clofthus@lineone.net\n\nMy grandfather\n\nThis story hardly comes into the realms of sailors at sea during the wars, but nevertheless may be worthy of inclusion. I am descended from a Norwegian family who came from the village of Lofthus in Hardanger Fjord. Although they left there about 1900, I still have a relative living in Lofthus, he and I share the same great great great grandfather. Purely by chance, another member of the family who lives in BC Canada has discovered my existence and we have started a flurry of communication uncovering the family history. He and I share the same great grandfather, who came to England. He was a marine engineer, and worked on the trawler fleet. His son was Harold Lofthus, my grandfather who by about 1910 had moved to Aberdeen Scotland. Harold badly wanted to join the Royal Navy when WW1 started but was unable to do so because of his nationality. He did the next best thing and followed in his father's footsteps by becoming an engineer on trawlers. At one time their trawler was sunk and they took to the lifeboats, but were rescued. However, in October 1917 their trawler appeared in Peterhead Harbour Scotland with an unexploded German mine in tow, a rather reckless act. It is perhaps significant to learn that the skipper was known in the fleet as \"Mad Dog Noble\". They were ordered out of the harbour, and the vessel and crew were never seen again. The losses of East Coast trawlers at sea during and between both wars has been very extensively documented. However, I can find no trace of any record referring to this particular trawler. I of course never knew Harold, he exists only in stories which I have heard over the years, but my father and his brother were deeply shocked by the loss of their father, and never talked of him. They not surprisingly were also left with an abhorrence of war and everything to do with it.\n\nI have Cyril's E-mail address in my files.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nJune 14\n\nFrom: Laurence J Downey\n\nfuture discussion\n\nDear Siri Holm Lawson,\n\nYou are to be congratulated for the exceptionally fine work you have achieved in posting the details of the Norwegian Merchant Marine and the story of your father. During WWII I sailed on six Norwegian vessels, \"Anna Odland\" \"Marathon\" \"Panama Express\" \"Vito\" \"China\" (Panamanian reg. Norwegian crew. \"Tai Ping Yang\" It was on the \"Marathon\" that I sailed in convoys JW 61 and RA 62 to Russia through the Arctic Cirle. Currently I am a member of the Russian Convoy Club in the U.K. (Member No 407) This Club is closing down because of the declining rate of \"old age\" members. I have a proposal in mind regarding the formation of Peace Time Convoys to war torn and depressed regions of the world calling on veteran MN personnel to support this project. I would very much like to provide you with more detailed information if you so desire.\n\nYours sincerely, Laurence Downey.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nJune 14\n\nFrom: Dee Zamolo\n\nTroya - Norwegian cargo vessel\n\nCould you please help me find some information or pictures on the Norweigian Vessel Troya. My father was a crew member during World War 2 and would love some information on this ship.\n\nTroja is listed here.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nJune 14\n\nFrom: Richard Batley, Thornhill, Dumfriesshire,Scotland\n\nReference Silvaplana\n\nHi - I have found your website purely by chance when I entered Silvaplana and HMS Adventure into a Google search. I did this purely out of curiosity having just read an account of the sinking in a newspaper dated May 18 1943. This differs somewhat from what is now known to be the true story you relate (the newspaper report states that the Silvaplana was a German ship with no mention of her being a captured vessel).\n\nI have scanned the article, which takes up most of the depth of a column, and it has come out very well.

All I know is that his name is Jan, he worked for the Thors River or Thors Hope Boat Line (he sent me a picture of a boat called the S.S. Bosphorus in the 1960's), he was born in Norway (about 60 years old), his friend on the boat at the time (Terence Dunn) said my father left in 1966 to go back to school to be a captain. I was born in May 1964. My mother left me in 1966 and thereafter I was adopted by my grandmother. (Because I was adopted he would not be able to find me) I was wondering if you could find any information on this boat (names of men that were aboard) or where my father would have gone to school at the time. Any information would be a great help.\n\nThanking you in advance.\n\nSincerely Cindy Clara\n\nP.S.

My mother played piano at concerts in Bangour Hospital. She met there Hans Kristofferson who was a whaler on \"Salvestria\" when she struck a mine almost underneath the Forth Bridge on 27 July 1940. When he recovered Hans came to our house and met and married a friend of our family. He gave me a book called \"Snow Treasure\" by Marie McSwigan which told the story of how the Norwegian gold was smuggled out of Norway from the Germans by children putting the gold bars on their sledges and taken to a trawler hidden in a fiord. I do not know how true the story is but it is still my favourite book ! If anybody can tell me more about Salvestria or the book I would be very plased to hear from them. By the way, I have read the book to two of my grandchildren and the other two will soon be old enough to listen.\n\nMymwife and I visited Telemark 3 years ago and had wonderful walking in the forest along the ski trails. I could just imagine the children sledging down with the gold under the noses of the Germans.\n\nArchie Gilbert, Kinross - Scotland.\n\nThe book Snow Treasures is fictional.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nMay 12\n\nFrom: Mike Smith\n\nThe Royal Navy in 1940\n\nSir\n\nMy fathers brother was one of the hundreds of British servicemen who were killed when the HMS Glorious was sunk off Norway in early 1940, he was a CPO Gunnery.\n\nI have just been taking a look about your pages on WW2 medals and awards, and I noted that with several you mention that they were awardable to allies. I have heard persistant rumours over the last few years that Norway issued a war medal to all those allied soldiers, sailors, and airman that assisted in the Liberation of Norway. Are you able to shed any light on this rumour, and what the next step would be.\n\nThis is a question I get very often, and I'm not entirely sure what to answer. I've heard that it's now too late to apply for these medals, then others again say they are still awarded. If you know exactly who to contact on this matter, please let me know, so that I can better help others.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nMay 2-3003\n\nFrom: Carleen Lawson\n\nSame-names\n\nGreetings - I was simply spending a little bit of time looking at the computer during my lunch hour and I happened to see your webpage.

She sank in the pool and was later refloated. This was related to me by \" Monty\" Gjerpin, master of another sister ship Gudvang on which I was a crew member at the time.\n\nThanks!

On your website there is an S/S Gudvang sunk trying to escape from the Baltic during the war. Could this be a result of renaming ? The Gudvang I sailed on had a B&W diesel open cylinder, and was built I believe in the 20,s. During the war she was obviously an armed merchantman as she had a gun deck and gun crews quarters. She also had an extra auxilliary generater and about a 4 inch copper cable around her holds. The purpose of these was to expell magnetic mines. I would very much like to know the history of this ship as I have some good memories. I would like to hear from ex crew.\n\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nApr. 19\n\nFrom: E Siteman\n\nWrong last name\n\nMy brother Robert (Bobbie) Siteman was on the SS Blink a Norwegion ship which was torpedoed by a German submirine during World War II. The details is posted in this site. Wrong name Siterman. Right name Siteman. He was a mess boy.\n\nMy mother met one of the survivers in Halifax.N.S. after the tradgety. To read this detailed result, of how it ended, has shoke me up . and brings it back to life, although I was only age 11 0r 12 at the time. And to read how many ships on this side was lost, is shocking to see how unprepared the rest of the world was. to allow one contry to do all that distruction to the world. I say go for it USA. Stop it now, before it happens again. Could you please tell me how, and why a Canadian boy as young as my brother would be allowed to work on a Norwegion Ship.? Was it legal?. Someone had to sign for someone as young as him. Where was Canada's Laws.?\n\nPeace for all.\n\nThe harrowing account of the days in the Blink lifeboats, written by Birger Lunde can be found on an individual page. Birger Lunde's son has told me that his father made a point of visiting the families of every one of the casualties from Blink afterwards, so this is probably the survivor Robert Siteman's mother met in Halifax.\n\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nApr. 18\n\nFrom: Clifford Mombourquette\n\nE-mail: The e-mail address was faulty - my reply was returned to me as undeliverable, so there's no way I can help with this.\n\nMedals\n\nThis inquiry is on behalf of my father, Clifford Mombourquette.

I am especially interested in a Norwegian Ship called the Inga which was lost and which i found the wreck 2 years ago. There was only 1 survivor a man called Andreas Birkland (Barkland or Burkland is also given by some sources). I wondered if in your researches into later Norwegian shipwrecks you had come across anyone that might have information on this ship?\n\nThere were 4 other Norwegian ships also lost on our coast in that storm, the Christiane, congo, Erato and Haabet. If you are interested i can send you ship files that i have compiled on these wrecks and a data base on 1901, i also have a database on North East Shipwrekcs which include a lot of vessels through the ages for Norway that were lost.

Unfortunately, I did experinece some difference in opinion from this site owner from another forum of WWII. Probably a misunderstanding from an amateur & sensitive historian...?\n\nThanks Joe - as you can see from this Guestbook, not everyone agrees with you, and that includes real historians, many authors etc. etc. so I shall continue to pour my heart and soul into this site, in my own special amateur and sensitive way. It has helped a lot of people, and this is my reward.\n\nYou insist on twisting everything I say, and giving it a meaning of your own choosing, but there's nothing I can do about that, and I have more important things to do with my time than involve myself any further in childish rhetoric.

He used to tell me some of his stories, but he never spoke about the horrible ordeals he went through. I can remember how he used to try to teach me Morse code, and how we used to play with boats in the pool. He taught me how to fish, row, and how to appreciate life. Although he has been gone for almost 7 years now, his legacy still remains. Not a day goes by that I don't think about him, and it was wonderful to have found your site. Thank you.\n\nAnnelise Lunde\n\nThere's a link to information on Blink in the message below.\n\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nFebr. 14\n\nFrom: Tony Price\n\nD/S Blink\n\nPlease would you update your records by including the first name of my uncle who was killed when the Blink was torpedoed.

Dignitaries from both Britain and France will be in attendance at this Civic Ceremony.\n\nThe Memorial Plaque will be in polished black granite inscribed in Gilt lettering facing the remains of the famous Mulberry Harbour (Churchill's project). It is to all Merchant Seamen who lost their lives in the \"Liberation of Europe\" 1944-45.\n\nThe inscription on the stone will be headed:\n\n\"TO THE MEMORY OF MERCHANT NAVY SEAMEN who lost their lives in the Naval 'Operation Neptune' June 6th - September 1944. Also to the memory of the Merchant Navy Seamen who lost their lives in European Coastal Waters until Europe was finally Liberated in May 1945\".\n\nOver 300,000 people visit this site annually, so many people will read of the sacrifice made by those men so Europe could be free\".\n\nAdditional funds are still needed, so if anyone would care to send a donation, or if you would like to attend the ceremony on June 6 you can contact Don at Nmnmf@aol.com or go to www.mna.org.uk for more information.\n\nSiri (warsailors.com)\n\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nFebr. 7\n\nFrom: Roger Mansell\n\nNorwegian sailors who died at Ofuna\n\nI received a request to identify and provide information regarding two Norwegian sailors who perished at Ofuna POW Camp.

I am your long lost \"cousin\" by marriage. We met at the Jane Phillips hospital when I did your heart test (Echocardiogram).\n\nI apologize for being such a poor correspondent. Life has been extremely busy. Buying a house, moving, crazy at work, etc,, etc.......\n\nAnyway, GENEALOGY has taken a backseat to daily life for the moment.\n\nRest assured that I will keep in touch and get back to you as soon as I can.\n\nTake Care,\n\nWil\n\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nJan. 22-2003\n\nFrom: Laurent Rizzotti\n\nNorwegian lifes lost in WWII\n\nHi Siri,\n\nI'm a regular reader of your site and the ship form, that I enjoyed greatly but I'm not spezialised enough to ask or reply questions here.\n\nToday I arrived on your statistics page (for the first time certainly) and saw the table 'Loss of Norwegian Lives WW II'.\n\nI have data to complete this table :\n\nTotal Norwegian losses trough ww2: 10262\n\nMerchant fleet: 3638\n\nMilitary forces during 1940 campaign: 853 (Army: 566, Navy: 283, Airforce: 4)\n\nMilitary forces rest of ww2: 1147 (Army: 199, Navy: 640, Airforce: 308)\n\nTotal military : 2000 (Army 765; Navy 923; Airforce 312)\n\nCivil population: 1779-1799 (185 civilians as a result of the campaign in 1940, 752 Norwegians killed during allied bombing raids after 1940, 700 people mainly civilians where killed on coastal steamers)\n\nHolocaust : 610-670\n\nPolitical and resistance: 1481-1483 (366 executed in Norway, 162 in \"home front\" related activities, 92 died while trying to escape to England, 130 died in imprisonment in Norway, around 730 died in imprisonment in Germany)\n\nIt seems important to me to distinguish people killed for underground participation and people killed for racists reasons, ie Jews.\n\nAlso your table may confuse some people as the 1400 people that died in deportation (either political or racial) are included in the underground total.\n\nNazi`s and collaboteurs: 65 (killed by Norwegians)\n\nFront fighters: 689 (\"Front fighters\" are volunteers engaged in the Axis forces. Not all were reported to SSB, numbers probably higher, 3 volunteers killed with Finland in Winter War probably included here)\n\nSource :\n\nStatistisk Sentralbyrå (SSB).\n\nInternet forums.\n\nBooks on 1940 campain I found in a library and forgot to quote the title.. giving the numbers for 1940 (military and civilian).\n\nNumber combination (example following)\n\nNote that your second row of numbers (death by cause) gave a total of 4384.\n\n3688 merchant men lost + 700 people lost on coastal steamers = 4388.\n\n1485 merchant men died in accidents of from diseases, 40% of losses of the war were \"not really war related\".... Count here is like for the military forces of all countries, a person dead between the beginning and the end of the war is counted as a war victim.\n\nRegards\n\nLaurent\n\nLaurent is referring to the numbers found on my Statistics & Misc. page.\n\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nJan. 20\n\nFrom: Ron Myhre\n\nNew E-Mail Address\n\nHello Siri,Godt Nytt AAr!!

My Dad was George Binney - Operation Performance, Rubble etc and I grew up hearing stories about the Norwegian ships, crews, blockade running etc. Recently I have written a book on SOE 'The women who lived for Danger' on SOE women agents and am now doing some research on my Dad.\n\nSomewhat separately I am researching the SOE training schools in the Uk. Many Norwegian agents were trained - especially at Aviemore in Scotland - where it was felt they would feel more at home.\n\nCan you suggest any way of contacting survivors? a website eg.\n\nbest wishes\n\nMarcus Binney\n\nMy text about Operation Performance tc. can be found on the page Kvarstad Ships & Men\n\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nJan. 14\n\nFrom: Robert Brewer\n\nD/S Torny\n\nMy uncle rescued survivors of the Norwegian freighter D/S Torny on May 8, 1942, following attack by U-507 in the Caribbean at 26 N 86 W. He was in a PBY, and flew the survivors to Pensacola (Florida) Naval Air Station.\n\nI wish to share information about this event with those survivors, and others who may have information and knowledge about the submarine attack, and the rescue.\n\nRobert Brewer\n\nTexas, USA\n\nMy text for D/S Torny can be found here.\n\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nJan. 14\n\nFrom: Roger\n\nA new link for you?\n\nHello Siri,\n\nAs I said on the Book Forum, you have great site. Check out www.navyphotos.co.uk A collection of over 1000 Photographs of Royal Navy ships from the 1800's to the 21st Century rescued from a rubbish tip! Also a link on the site to another in Plymouth UK with lots of other RN pictures.\n\nRegards Roger.\n\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nJan. 13\n\nFrom: Cyril Lofthus\n\nBelpamela\n\nI am putting together a short article about a class of SNCF railway locomotive, known as the 141R. These were built in USA and Canada and shipped across to various French ports from 1945 on, and one of the ships used was the Belpamela. However, she went down with 16 locomomotives on board off Newfoundland in 1946, and I am trying to find any details about her sinking. She was used before the war to take a Pacific locomotive from England to USA for an exhibition, so obviously she was suited to this sort of cargo. In fact the photograph on your site shows her loaded with either buses or railcars or something of that nature. Although I am Scottish my forefathers came from the village of Lofthus in Hardanger Fjord, leaving there for Canada in 1900. I still have a very distant relative in Lofthus and I correspond with his wife who is English. Although I do not have seafaring blood in my veins, my grandfather, who I never knew, was an Aberdeen trawler skipper, and was lost at sea, believed as a result of a mine, near the end of WW1. As to the Belpamela, I suppose you already know this, but I have been reading a site which mentions that Mosquitos f"
