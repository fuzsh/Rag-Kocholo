If Customer requests that Sumo Logic proceed with problem determination at its possible expense and Sumo Logic determines that the error was not due to an Error, Customer shall pay Sumo Logic, at Sumo Logicâs then-current consulting rates, for all work performed in connection with such determination, plus reasonable related expenses incurred therewith.\n\nIf Customer instructs Sumo Logic that it does not wish the problem pursued at its possible expense or if such determination requires effort in excess of Customerâs instructions, Sumo Logic may, at its sole discretion, elect not to investigate the Error with no liability therefor.\n\nFor clarity, Sumo Logic may offer Training Services to help resolve issues that fall outside the scope of Support. Any engagement of Training Services will be provided under a separate agreement, and will be subject to the Master Agreement.\n\nSumo Logic shall have no liability for any changes in Customerâs hardware or software systems that may be necessary to use the Sumo Logic Technology due to a Workaround or maintenance.\n\n6.

If Customer does not so notify Sumo Logic, or if Customer places new orders for, or renews Support or continues to pay Support Fees (if applicable), Customer will be deemed to have accepted such revisions for Support and the new Support Addendum. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary, in the event Sumo Logic revises this Support Addendum, Customer will not be entitled to any additional benefits or services offered thereunder absent the payment to Sumo Logic or resellers of the appropriate Fee related to said revision, if any.\n\n7.
