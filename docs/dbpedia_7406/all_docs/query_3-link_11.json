How is\n\nthis any different than cvs?\n\n* the cool open source tools which abound for CVS are missing\n\nMost of which aren't necessary with Perforce. ;)\n\nequally unfortunately, my own organisation can't use Perforce for\n\ndaily work (as I would like),\n\nas Perforce does not have any educational licensing,.\n\nThat kind of stinks. Have you tried to press Perforce about this? It\n\nseems like it would ultimately benefit them. :(\n\n_______________________________________________\n\nperforce-user mailing list - perforce-***@perforce.com\n\nhttp://maillist.perforce.com/mailman/listinfo/perforce-user\n\n--__--__--\n\nMessage: 19\n\nFrom: Patrick Bennett <***@inin.com>\n\nTo: Sebastian Rahtz <***@computing-services.oxford.ac.uk>\n\nDate: Mon, 19 Jan 2004 13:28:11 -0500\n\nSubject: Re: [p4] FYI: Source Depot\n\nSo a thousand checkouts of the source creates 1000 client specs.
