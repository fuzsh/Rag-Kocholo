The code is available using an Apache 2 license at https://github.com/vmware/hillview. In this presentation we describe and demonstrate the design and implementation of the system. Hillview offers sub-second renderings of billion-row datasets.  Hillview is built on top of a platform for executing distributed sketching algorithms. A core design principle is to compute only what can be displayed and nothing more. This principle sometimes enables the system to use constant-work algorithms, independent on the actual data size.
