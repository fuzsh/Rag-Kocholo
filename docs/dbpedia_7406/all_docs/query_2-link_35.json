        "text": "1. Generally. As part of Customer's purchase of Google Cloud Platform Services, Google will provide Basic (formerly Bronze) Support to Customer. Customer may order additional TSS for an additional fee.\n\n2. Basic Support. Customer will receive automatic Services upgrades and Maintenance updates, support for billing inquiries, and access to documentation, white papers, online best practices guides, and community forums.\n\n3. Support Request Submission.\n\n3.1. First Line Support. Customer will provide first-level support to Customer End Users. Google will provide second-level support to Customer’s Designated Contacts only.\n\n3.2. Customer Efforts to Fix Errors. Prior to making a request to Google, Customer will use reasonable efforts to fix any error, bug, malfunction or network connectivity defect without escalation to Google. Thereafter, Customer may submit a Request for TSS.\n\n3.3. Characterization of Requests. Customer designates P1-P4 priority upon submission of Requests. Google will review Customer's priority designation and may reclassify designations (a) that Google believes are incorrect or (b) where Customer fails to maintain continuous availability, as described in Section 3.4 (Procedures for Acknowledgement and Resolution of Requests) through the resolution of a Request. Any such determination made by Google is final and binding on Customer. Any reclassification by Google of the Priority designation pursuant to subsection (b) will be reversed once Customer resumes continuous availability with Google in accordance with Section 3.4 (Procedures for Acknowledgement and Resolution of Requests).\n\n3.4. Procedures for Acknowledgement and Resolution of Requests. When making a Request, Customer will provide all requested diagnostic information and assist Google Support Personnel as may be required to resolve a Request. Customer must provide up-to-date contact information (i.e., phone or email) to assist with data gathering, testing and applying resolutions. In the case of P1 Requests, Customer must maintain continuous availability until resolution of such Requests. Upon resolution of a Request, Customer may receive an optional survey to provide feedback to Google on the support Request experience.\n\n3.5. Request Acknowledgement. Google may respond to a Request by acknowledging receipt of the Request. Customer acknowledges and understands that Google may be unable to provide answers to, or resolve all Requests.\n\n3.6. Feature Requests. If Google deems a Request to be a Feature Request, Google will log such Request for consideration to add to a future update or release of the Services and will consider the matter closed. Google is under no obligation to respond to or resolve any Feature Request or to include any such Feature Request in any future update or release.\n\n3.7. Building Applications. Google has no obligation under these Guidelines to: (a) write, build or improve any software Applications, or write code to facilitate Applications; (b) configure the Services for Customer; or (c) design, build or review Customer infrastructure.\n\n3.8. Pre-General Availability Offerings.\n\na. Pre-GA Offerings. Google has no obligation to provide TSS for Pre-GA Offerings (as defined in the Service Specific Terms) or any offerings identified as “Preview,” “Alpha,” “Beta,” “Experimental,” or similar designation, but will consider Requests relating to Pre-GA Offerings or similar offerings on a case-by-case basis.\n\nb. Pre-GA Support Offerings Terms. Google may make available to Customer pre-general availability technical support services or features, in each case, that are identified as “Preview,” “Alpha,” “Beta,” “Experimental,” or similar designation in related documentation or materials or are not yet listed in these Guidelines (collectively, “Pre-GA Support Offerings”). While Pre-GA Support Offerings are not TSS, Customer’s use of Pre-GA Support Offerings is subject to the terms of these Guidelines, as amended by this Section (Pre-GA Support Offerings Terms) and, any additional terms provided to Customer in the Google Support Tool or order form or otherwise presented by Google (the “Additional Pre-GA Support Terms”). In the event of conflict between the terms of these Guidelines and the Additional Pre-GA Support Terms, the Additional Pre-GA Support Terms govern.\n\n1. Pre-GA Support Offerings may be changed, suspended, or discontinued at any time without prior notice to Customer.\n\n2. At its option, Customer may provide feedback and suggestions about the Pre-GA Support Offerings to Google (“Pre-GA Support Feedback”). If Customer provides Pre-GA Support Feedback, then Google and its Affiliates may use that Pre-GA Support Feedback without restriction and without obligation to Customer, excluding any Pre-GA Support Feedback marked as Customer Confidential Information.\n\n3. Target initial response times and language support as described in these Guidelines may be different or unavailable for Pre-GA Support Offerings.\n\n4. Accessing Support.\n\n4.1. Setting Designated Contacts. Customer-designated support admins may add Designated Contacts to its Account. Solely with respect to Silver, Gold, and Platinum TSS, if Customer wishes to change its Designated Contacts, it will notify Google via the Google Support Tool at least five Business Days prior to the change, as applicable.\n\n4.2. Support Hours and Target Initial Response Times. Google will process Requests during the Hours of Operation and in accordance with the applicable target initial response times for each support level, unless otherwise indicated in these Guidelines. Any Requests received outside of the Hours of Operation will be logged and processed during the next Business Day.\n\n4.3. Compliance with Applicable Law. Google will not provide TSS if prohibited from doing so by applicable law.\n\n5. Maintenance. To ensure optimal performance of the Services, Google performs periodic Maintenance. In most cases, Maintenance will have limited or no negative impact on the availability and functionality of the Services. If Google expects planned Maintenance to negatively affect the availability or functionality of the Services, Google will use commercially reasonable efforts to provide at least seven days' advance notice of the Maintenance. In addition, Google may perform emergency unscheduled Maintenance at any time. If Google expects such emergency unscheduled Maintenance to negatively affect the availability or functionality of the Services, Google will use commercially reasonable efforts to provide advance notice of such Maintenance. Maintenance notices noted above will be provided via the Google Support Tool or via an email to the Notification Email Address.\n\n6. Language Support. All support provided by Google pursuant to these Guidelines will be provided in the English language except as provided at https://cloud.google.com/support/docs/language-working-hours.\n\n7. Technical Account Management (TAM). As part of the Platinum, Enterprise and Premium Support offerings, Customer will receive access to a named Technical Account Manager to: (a) assist Customer in developing a strategy with respect to the Services, (b) provide best practice guidance on implementation and use of the Services, and (c) manage technical support escalations and coordinate with Google subject matter experts to address technical inquiries related to the Services. Additional access to Technical Account Management, with a concurrent subscription to Platinum, Enterprise and Premium Support, may be purchased, subject to additional fees and terms.\n\n8. Professional Services. In addition to the support and maintenance services described above, Google may provide limited advisory services to Customer under these Guidelines in accordance with an order form executed by Google and Customer and datasheets associated with the services. Additional fees may apply. Advisory services are recommendations only. Customer is responsible for the results achieved when determining whether to implement recommendations from Google. Google may deliver recommendations to Customer in the form of a working paper or report, which Customer may use, modify and reproduce for its internal business purposes. Google will not otherwise license any intellectual property to Customer as part of the advisory services provided under these Guidelines. Any other advisory, professional or implementation services will be subject to the terms of a separate agreement between Google and Customer.\n\n9. Collaborative Support. In recognition that Customer may deploy and use Services that are offered in connection with or that rely upon a range of third party hardware and software components and computing platforms, resolving Requests may sometimes require input from third-party technology partners who have collaborated with Google to offer technologies that can be used in conjunction with the Services (such providers, \"Collaborative Support Partners\"). Google will, in its reasonable determination, identify to Customer any Requests that require the involvement of Collaborative Support Partner(s). Google may include Collaborative Support Partners in support communications with Customer or communicate with the Collaborative Support Partner on Customer’s behalf, subject to the following terms:\n\n9.1. Customer may only receive support from a Collaborative Support Partner if Customer has a valid support agreement in place with that Collaborative Support Partner. Neither these Guidelines nor the Agreement grant to Customer any right to receive support services from Collaborative Support Partners.\n\n9.2. Google will include Collaborative Support Partners in direct support communications with Customer, or communicate with the Collaborative Support Partner on Customer’s behalf, solely at Customer's direction and only after receiving Customer’s consent.\n\n9.3. When Customer consents to involve a Collaborative Support Partner in an ongoing support case:\n\na. Customer consents to Google providing that Collaborative Support Partner with information Google reasonably deems relevant to the Request, including Customer's name, contact information, and a description of the Request;\n\nb. the Collaborative Support Partner acts as an independent contractor of the Customer, not Google; and\n\nc. the Collaborative Support Partner, not Google, is solely responsible for the processing and use of any information provided to that Collaborative Support Partner in the course of providing support services.\n\n10. Resold Customer. A customer (a “Resold Customer”) of a Google-authorized unaffiliated Google Cloud Platform reseller (a “Reseller”) may purchase Google-supplied technical support services that are approved and enabled for resale through the Reseller (“Resold TSS”), provided that:\n\n10.1. the prices and fees for Resold TSS, and the terms applicable to Resold Customer’s use of Resold TSS, are agreed as between Resold Customer and the Reseller;\n\n10.2. any payment for Resold TSS is made directly to Reseller under Resold Customer’s applicable agreement with the Reseller; and\n\n10.3. Google will not provide Resold Customer any billing inquiry support on the Services.\n\n11. Chrome Support. If Customer purchases Enhanced or Premium Support then Google Support Personnel will also respond to Requests related to Chrome installation, Chrome Core Functionality, Chrome’s security and administrative policies, and Chrome’s interoperability with Services on Supported Platforms as set forth in these Guidelines. Google may choose not to respond to Requests for other Chrome related technical issues, such as but not limited to, rendering problems for specific web pages, technical issues related to the underlying operating system, device driver or printer problems. If Google makes a code change to Chrome to resolve a technical issue, that code change will be released in an upcoming release and will not be ported back to an earlier version of Chrome.\n\n12. Exceptions. Regardless of any other statement in the Agreement or these Guidelines, Google does not offer TSS for Looker Studio (except for Looker Studio Pro).\n\nGoogle will provide Comprehensive Support for Looker (Google Cloud core) as described at https://cloud.google.com/terms/tssg/comprehensive.\n\nFor the following Google Cloud Platform Services, Google offers technical support under separate terms set forth at the corresponding URL:\n\nService Technical Support Terms Cloud Identity https://cloud.google.com/terms/identity/tssg Apigee Edge ** https://cloud.google.com/terms/apigee-support (“Apigee Edge TSSG”)\n\nFor the following Google Cloud Platform Services and related products, Google offers TSS under these Guidelines except as provided at the corresponding URL:\n\n**TSS for legacy Apigee Edge customers who have not yet renewed Apigee Edge to have their support provided by these TSS (as modified by the Apigee Support Services Guide) will be provided under the Apigee Edge TSSG.
