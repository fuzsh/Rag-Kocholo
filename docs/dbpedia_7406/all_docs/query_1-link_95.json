        "text": "Originally Posted by closure\n\n\"Fact is, Google didn't just implement a similar API, they lifted almost the complete API, they copied the whole concept, including the runtime environment and that's where things get hairy, because they essentially stole the whole technology, even if they implemented most methods themselves. Let's be serious, you could take most non UI related Java code out there and run it 1:1 in Dalvik, unchanged and yes, I think this is a problem.\"\n\nGoogle did no such thing. Android is the combination of an open source Linux operating system modified for mobile, the Apache Harmony Open Source Java implementation, and the Dalvik VM. Google didn't implement anything, they shipped Harmony. There are three implementations of the Java APIs, all of them open source. There's Apache Harmony under ASL. There's GNU Classpath under GPL, and there's OpenJDK under GPL. Usage of the terminology \"stolen\" with respect to open source is a non-sequitur. You can't steal something meant to be distributed and allow derivative works. Did Apple \"steal\" KHTML when they created WebKit?\n\nComplaining about someone shipping a clean-room implementation of a virtual machine that can run code compiled with other tools is a ridiculous. Imagine I wrote an iOS game by using Microsoft Visual C/C++ tools for 99% of the work, and then at the last step, I linked it with XCode and a Cocoa<->WPF library to produce a working iOS app. Should Microsoft sue for someone to ship such a tool? It's fundamentally outrageous to tell a developer what he can do with his code. The fact that you use tools to create code doesn't entitle you to ownership of the result. That would be a crazy regression of rights.\n\nIf I write some Java code with Oracle's tools, they have no rights, zero, to saying what I can do with the results or where I can run it.\n\nAlso, Ellison is completely ignoring what Android is doing for Java -- making it relevant on the client again. Java died on the client, and the only place it survived was in the enterprise. Now there are almost a billion devices that run Java code on the client. Rather than trying to extract a tax out of Google for rescuing the platform that was dying a rapid death of relevance on the client, he should have been looking at ways to make Oracle relevant in this new universe of Java phones."
