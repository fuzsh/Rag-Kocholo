        "text": "ACM SIGCOMM 2019 Full-Day Tutorial on Programming the Network Data Plane (P4)\n\nTutorial Program (subject to changes)\n\nCall For Participation\n\nThis tutorial will provide participants with a hands-on experience working with the P4 language (www.p4.org). Attendees will learn how to express conventional and novel data-plane applications in the P4 language, and how to compile, execute, and evaluate P4 programs using Mininet, a network emulation framework.\n\nThe second half of the day will consist of a mini P4 Workshop for participants to present early stage research ideas. If you would like to give a short 10-15 minute talk, please submit a 1-page talk proposal to the following website: https://p4workshop.cs.cornell.edu/\n\nOutline\n\nThe goal of the tutorial is two-fold:\n\nWe will emphasize aspects of data-plane programming that were only briefly covered in previous P4 tutorials, including the P4 langauge-architecture separation and stateful packet processing. Through a series of exercises, we will show them how to prototype network applications in the P4 language and compile them to programmable devices. By the end of the tutorial, attendees will be able to implement novel data-plane features in P4, and evaluate their programs using Mininet, a network emulation framework.\n\nWe will expose attendees to exciting new applications and future research directions enabled by data-plane programming.\n\nMore specifically, we plan to cover the following topics:\n\nP4 language overview and the language-architecture separation\n\nHands-on training of P4 development environment -Compiler\n\nDebugger\n\nBehavioral model\n\nLab Exercises\n\nMini-workshop â invited talks focusing on the following categories\n\nEmerging P4 applications\n\nFuture research directions\n\nNew P4 targets and tools\n\nTeaching resources\n\nAudience Expectations and Prerequisites\n\nAttendees will be expected to have basic familiarity with the P4 lanaguage. Novice participants without any prior P4 experience are encouraged to refer to the Getting Started wiki page.\n\nAttendees will also be expected to bring their own laptops. We will provide a VM image containing all the necessary packages and tools. The P4 specification is publicly available at the P4 website under an Apache license. Key development tools (front-end compiler and software switch capable of running P4 programs) are available as open-source tools (http://github.com/p4lang).\n\nTutorial Instructions\n\nIn order to ensure that you arrive prepared for the tutorial we ask that you please follow the instructions listed on our GitHub repository.\n\nIf you attend and complete the P4 tutorial and you would like to receive a certificate of completion from P4.org, please send an email to sibanez@stanford.edu indicating your request.\n\nMini-Workshop Program\n\nLeveraging P4 to Automatically Validate Networking Switches.

Vladimir Braverman (Johns Hopkins University)\n\nBackground\n\nP4 (www.p4.org) is a programming language for describing how network packets should be processed on a variety of targets ranging from general-purpose CPUs to network processors, FPGAs, and custom ASICs [1]. P4 was designed with three goals in mind: (i) protocol independence: devices should not âbake inâ specific protocols; (ii) field re-configurability: programmers should be able to modify the behavior of devices after they have been deployed; and (iii) portability: programs should not be tied to specific hardware targets.\n\nThe P4 community has created â and continues to maintain and develop â a language specification, a set of open-source tools (compilers, debuggers, code analyzers, libraries, software P4 switches, etc.), and sample P4 programs with the goal of making it easy for P4 users to quickly and correctly author new data-plane behaviors. New ideas are being developed in P4, prototyped as new forwarding behaviors, and published at some of the top conferences in networking. Existing data-plane features typically realized in a fixed-function logic are also being authored in P4.\n\nRecently, P4 evolved to embrace the functional and architectural heterogeneity of various targets while keeping the language core simple and clean. One manifestation of this change is the development of a Portable Switch Architecture (PSA). The PSA describes common capabilities of network switch devices which process and forward packets across multiple interface. This specification improves the portability and composability of a P4 program, allowing P4 consumers and target providers to reuse their code. Second, in the past year, there have been significant new developments on the control-plane API for P4 pipelines. This tutorial will introduce P4 Runtime, the silicon-independent and protocol-independent API that can be auto-generated from an unambiguous definition of a packet processing pipeline in P4. Third, P4 continues to be a transformative technology in networking, and an increasingly popular choice for developing novel data-plane designs. Examples include P4 programs that realize in-band network telemetry [4], path-condition-aware adaptive routing [5], a better NetFlow [6], L4 connection load-balancing [7], replicated storage systems [8], and fast failure detection and recovery [9]. There are also new P4 programmable targets available to the research community [10]. We believe there are many opportunities for academic researchers to help evolve the design of the language, discover new implementation techniques, and develop use cases.\n\nOrganizers\n\nStephen Ibanez\n\nCalifornia, USA\n\nChanghoon (Chang) Kim\n\nCalifornia, USA\n\nReferences"
