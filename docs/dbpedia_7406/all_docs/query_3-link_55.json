        "text": "After installing software, the X308P-48Y-T can be deployed as a top-of-rack (ToR) switch as well as smart gateway for tasks such as traffic management, load balance, and security processing, with its ASIC level programmability enabling flexibility in dealing with different network scenarios.\n\nWhen employed with more complex applications, such as those which need deep buffer, stateful processing, or L7 processing, the pluggable DPU module can be chosen to provide high performance software data processing, where the DPDK and VPP framework can be used to provide developers a quick start development environment in a similar way to the Intel X86.\n\nAsterfusion X308 do have some differences in the system design: 1. We provide 48x25G with 8x100G in 1RU in front panel, 2. We provide 2x DPU extension slots in the same 1RU box with around 600w more power and thermal budget. These two-system design provides unique features and more design complexity.\n\nFor software support: we will offer you patch for BSP of platform for the SDE; if you want to develop a switch like application, you can use SONiC from the community and we will offer you patches to support hardware.\n\nIn the hardware bare metal, there are two options: 1. ONIE; 2. ONIE with ONL or Debian\n\nYes, For tofino series switch, Asterfusion offers 10% off for academia and research program. Please email us.\n\nWhen talking about memory I think you must be familiar with Tofino chip, there is only internal buffer memory onchip, which is 20MB. But I also guess you may ask the memory on the daughter card connecting to the Tofino, which is a 24-core ARM64 DPU based H/W and you can write and run vNF code in the DPU.\n\nThis DPU module will need a carry board, We usually use DPU module in several of our own switch devices. Well, because this DPU module use our own interfaces, so it cannot be plugged easily to other system unless you develop you own carrier board. If you just want a card can be plugged into server, your use our DPU based SmartNIC\n\nIn theory, there is no limitations on packet number in a queue, but all the queues share 20MB memory. There is no performance penalty in the scheduler because it’s a part of ASIC\n\nIf you want develop application for P4 data plane, then the SDE from intel would help you, we will offer you patch for BSP of platform for the SDE; if you want to develop a switch like application, you can use SONiC from community and we will offer you patches to support our hardware; We can even help you to combine P4 and SONiC together to reduce you time-to-market. We have a 30+ people team working on P4 related work and rich experience to develop varies network traffic processing applications on Tofino.\n\nIt depends on what kind of application are you developing, usually people can start from SONiC community version for switch enhancement, we can offer you a ready-to-run SONiC version as your development basis; or people need to develop some new applications like NPB or gateway using P4, at this time you will have get a license from Intel, usually it is a huge project when you start your development, let’s discuss in the meeting to see how we can help.\n\n20MB for whole chip and shared by all ports. When we implement our own vNF, we use DPU card to process all traffic while offload elephant flow to Tofino program written in P4.Which means, on chip memory and on chip table usually used as a fast flow cache for vNF programs on DPU."
