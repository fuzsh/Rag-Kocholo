Basically they show that you don't (and often times you can't) use some ML techniques to acquire the best(/optimal) solution, choosing sub-optimal solution usually offers better scalability.\n\nOptional (more on serveless): Encoding, Fast and Slow: Low-Latency Video Processing Using Thousands of Tiny Threads (NSDI ’17), Stanford & UCSD (Demo: NSDI video 4:35, 16:14)\n\nCristina, Connor and I will lead a recap session for NSDI ’19. The format is probably 30 min of brief recap plus 30 min of open question/discussion."
