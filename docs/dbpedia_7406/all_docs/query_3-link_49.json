        "text": "Configuring the Server\n\nThe Perforce service is highly configurable and this is accomplished through the setting of server, client, and proxy configurables. Available configurables number in the hundreds, and it is probably best to set them as you continue to work with the server. This chapter limits itself to describing the configurables you might initially want to configure before you begin working with the server.\n\nThe following areas are covered:\n\nEnabling distributed versioning\n\nUsing p4 typemap to determine a fileâ€™s type and to implement site-wide exclusive locking\n\nDefining additional depots\n\nManaging client requests\n\nManaging case sensitivity and Unicode installations\n\nConfiguring logging\n\nConfiguring P4V settings"
