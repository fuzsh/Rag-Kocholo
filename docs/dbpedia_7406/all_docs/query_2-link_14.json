The Receiving Party shall, however, be permitted to disclose\n\nrelevant aspects of a Disclosing Party’s Confidential Information to its consultants, officers and employees and to the consultants, officers and employees of its corporate Affiliates to the extent that such disclosure is reasonably necessary for the performance of its duties and obligations under this License Agreement; provided, however, that such party shall take all reasonable measures, consistent with the manner in which such party protects its own Confidential Information from time to time, to ensure that Confidential Information of the other party is not disclosed or duplicated in contravention of the provisions of this License Agreement by such consultants, officers and employees. The Receiving Party shall be responsible for any breach of the provisions of this Section 8.1 by its consultants, officers, or employees. The obligations in this Section 8.1 shall not restrict any disclosure by either party pursuant to:\n\nany applicable law or legislation;\n\nany order of any court of competent jurisdiction or government agency;\n\nrequirements for disclosure to regulators;\n\nrequirements for disclosure as part of the arbitration process contemplated under this License Agreement pursuant to Section 16; and\n\nrequirements for disclosure required in the course of judicial proceedings to enforce rights and/or remedies under this License Agreement, providing that the Receiving Party has taken all reasonable steps to obtain a judicial order to close such proceedings and files relating to such information to all persons other than pursuant to such judicial order, unless such process has been waived in writing by the Disclosing Party,\n\nprovided that the Receiving Party shall endeavour to give prompt notice to the Disclosing Party of any such requirement to disclose.\n\nEach Party recognizes that its disclosure of Confidential Information in respect of the other party may give rise to irreparable injury to the other party and acknowledges that remedies other than injunctive relief may not be adequate. Accordingly, without implementing the dispute resolution procedures described in this License Agreement to prevent the unauthorized possession, use, disclosure or knowledge of any Confidential Information, in the event of a breach, or threatened breach, of any of the provisions of this Section 8, Disclosing Party shall be entitled to seek an interim injunction, interlocutory injunction and permanent injunction in addition to and not in limitation of any other rights, remedies or damages available to Disclosing Party at law or in equity including, but not limited to, specific performance and other such relief as a court of competent jurisdiction may deem just and proper, as well as such monetary damages as may be proven at law. Receiving Party further agrees to waive any requirement for the deposit of security or posting of any bond in connection with such remedy. Each of the parties hereto agree to waive the right for trial by jury of any or all issues arising in any action or proceeding between the parties hereto or their successors, with respect to the provisions of this Section 8.\n\nNotwithstanding this Article 8 or any other provision of this License Agreement, the parties shall be free to refer generally to the existence of this License Agreement and the type of commercial relationships created hereby, provided no disclosure of specific terms is made.\n\n9.
