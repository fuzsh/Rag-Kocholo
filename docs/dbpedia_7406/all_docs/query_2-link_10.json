        "text": "Less Restrictive Parts of ESP-IDFï\n\nSome parts of ESP-IDF are deliberately under less restrictive licenses in order to ease their re-use in commercial closed source projects. This is the case for ESP-IDF examples which are in Public domain or under the Creative Commons Zero Universal (CC0) license. The following header can be used in such source files:\n\n/* * SPDX-FileCopyrightText: 2015-2023 Espressif Systems (Shanghai) CO LTD * * SPDX-License-Identifier: Unlicense OR CC0-1.0 */\n\nThe option allowing multiple licenses joined with the OR keyword from the above example can be achieved with the definition of multiple allowed licenses in the tools/ci/check_copyright_config.yaml configuration file. Please use this option with care and only selectively for a limited part of ESP-IDF.\n\nThird Party Licensesï\n\nCode licensed under different licenses, modified by Espressif Systems and included in ESP-IDF cannot be licensed under Apache License 2.0 not even if the checker suggests it. It is advised to keep the original copyright header and add an SPDX before it.\n\nThe following example is a suitable header for a code licensed under the \"GNU General Public License v2.0 or later\" held by John Doe with some additional modifications done by Espressif Systems:\n\n/* * SPDX-FileCopyrightText: 1991 John Doe * * SPDX-License-Identifier: GPL-2.0-or-later * * SPDX-FileContributor: 2019-2023 Espressif Systems (Shanghai) CO LTD */\n\nThe licenses can be identified and the short SPDX identifiers can be found in the official SPDX license list. Other very common licenses are the GPL-2.0-only, the BSD-3-Clause, and the BSD-2-Clause.\n\nIn exceptional case, when a license is not present on the SPDX license list, it can be expressed by using the LicenseRef-[idString] custom license identifier, for example LicenseRef-Special-License. The full license text must be added into the LICENSES directory under Special-License filename.\n\n/* * SPDX-FileCopyrightText: 2015-2023 Espressif Systems (Shanghai) CO LTD * * SPDX-License-Identifier: LicenseRef-Special-License */\n\nDedicated LicenseRef-Included custom license identifier can be used to express a situation when the custom license is included directly in the source file.\n\n/* * SPDX-FileCopyrightText: 2015-2023 Espressif Systems (Shanghai) CO LTD * * SPDX-License-Identifier: LicenseRef-Included * * <Full custom license text> */\n\nThe configuration stored in tools/ci/check_copyright_config.yaml offers features useful for third party licenses:\n\nA different license can be defined for the files part of a third party library.\n\nThe check for a selected set of files can be permanently disabled. Please use this option with care and only in cases when none of the other options are suitable."
