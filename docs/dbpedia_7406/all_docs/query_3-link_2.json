It will also use commands.txt to configure each one of the switches. Once the network is up and running, you should type the following in the Mininet CLI:\n\nxterm h1 xterm h3 This will open a terminal for you on h1 and h3.\n\nOn h3 run: ./receive.py.\n\nOn h1 run: ./send.py h1 h3.\n\nYou should then be able to type messages on h1 and receive them on h3. The send.py program finds the shortest path between h1 and h3 using Dijkstra, then send correctly-formatted packets to h3 through s1 and s3]1\n\n.pcap files will be generated for every interface (9 files: 3 for each of the 3 switches). You can look at the appropriate files and check that your packets are being processed correctly\n\nanswered Feb 27, 2017 at 10:16\n\nKhattakKhattak\n\n2166 bronze badges\n\nThe code given at https://github.com/p4lang/tutorials/tree/master/SIGCOMM_2015#obtaining-required-software has the 'port' argument missing from the action route() method. The correct code is given below. Simply make this small change in the p4 code file and then execute the steps as mentioned in the tutorial given at https://github.com/p4lang/tutorials/tree/master/SIGCOMM_2015#obtaining-required-software.\n\n/* Copyright 2013-present Barefoot Networks, Inc.
