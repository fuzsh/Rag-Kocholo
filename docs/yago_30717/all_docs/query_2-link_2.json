Let’s take a look at his conquests over the years.\n\n1998: To avoid going to prison for his illegal financial dealings, Ryan makes a deal with Liza to tie the knot with Gillian. Before long, real feelings develop between the newlyweds.\n\n1999: After catching Gillian in bed with David Hayward (she was seeking comfort because Ryan couldn’t show his true feelings for her), Ryan is thrown into jail on rape charges. The true culprit turns out to be his brother Braden.

However, Hayley’s true love is Mateo.\n\n1999: Ryan begins sleeping with Greenlee, who is genuinely smitten with him. He, however, is just in it for the sex.\n\n2000: Ryan and Gillian renew their romance, but separate again when she can’t bring herself to divorce Jake.

After confiding in Mia how alone he feels, Ryan and Mia sleep together. She falls in love with him.\n\nNovember 2001: Liza miscarries when she falls down a flight of stairs. Ryan insists on a paternity test, which proves he was the father.\n\nApril 2002: After a long period of flirtation and sexual tension, Kendall and Ryan make love.\n\nJune 2002: Ryan and Kendall get engaged.\n\nJuly 2002: Ryan discovers Kendall seducing Aidan — she was trying to prove her innocence in an arson charge — and leaves town.\n\nOctober 2003: Ryan returns, and Kendall admits she still loves him. Ryan realizes he still has feelings for her.\n\nNovember 2003: Kendall and Ryan make love on the Fusion rooftop, but Kendall later claims it was a mistake.\n\nNovember 2003: Greenlee decides to pursue Ryan in an effort to save Fusion.\n\nDecember 2003: Ryan and Kendall decide to work on their relationship. They are together until New Year’s Eve, when Kendall turns to Aidan.\n\nJanuary 2004: Greenlee and Ryan share a passionate kiss, but Ryan stops it from escalating.\n\nJanuary 2004: Ryan is back in bed with Kendall, and admits under oath that he loves her. They get engaged for a second time.\n\nFebruary 2004: Greenlee demands that Ryan admit he has feelings for her. He concedes he has feelings for both her and Kendall, but plans to stay with Kendall. Ryan cuts Greenlee off when she sabotages Kendall’s trial defense. Kendall accuses Ryan of being in cahoots with Greenlee, so he walks out on her. Kendall returns his engagement ring.\n\nFebruary 2004: Ryan rescues Greenlee from a mine shaft.\n\nMarch 2004: Ryan and Greenlee decide to leave town together. They also decide their relationship must remain platonic, because sex would ruin things.\n\nApril 2004: Greenlee and Ryan return to Pine Valley the night Bianca “loses” Miranda.

They decide to end their marriage, even though Greenlee secretly has fallen in love with him. Unaware of Ryan’s feelings, Kendall sets him up to find her in bed with his brother Jonathan, who has just arrived in town. Ryan returns to Greenlee, who comforts him.\n\nAugust 2004: Ryan falls in love with Greenlee, and their marriage becomes real.\n\nMay 2005: Ryan gets a vasectomy to ensure he can never have children — despite Greenlee’s desire to start a family.\n\nJuly 2005: Ryan fakes his death when he learns Greenlee impregnated herself with his sperm.

Ryan discovers that he is Emma’s father, thanks to an anonymous sperm donation years ago.\n\nMarch 2007: Ryan proposes to Annie, who takes a lot of time to think about it, because she fears Ryan only wants to marry her because of Emma. Eventually, she accepts."
