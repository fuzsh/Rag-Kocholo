We just pumped neck full of like six units of the wrong blood type. There's no way he survives the flight. So just be prepared to receive his money. We would be getting dudes that were coming in from these other elements for us to work with. Did that bother you? They can get tricky. One of the individuals that was inside that Ford Ranger, jumped up on the back of the truck, engaged into the group with that PKM.\n\nI see what's happened. I got on 15 and so feet away from the group, ripped it into the crowd. Guys were dropping, guys were scrambling. Things are blowing up kind of all around. And I just feel the impact. Things are blowing up kind of all around and I just feel the impact. I have to cauterize your base back together to make it 47-round to the side of my fix.\n\nYoung kid, first deployment, fresh out of basic. he's 15 feet in front of a guy who's shooting machine gun in his general direction. I know everyone in the truck is dead, and my right leg is just fucking man-court. It's just like hamming me in tissue and exposed bone, and there's just a rev-up flow. It's the ultimate mass-cal scenario. To this day, considered the most catastrophic inside of the attack, since the global war terrorism began. 1 tbc 1 tbc 1 tbc 1 tbc 1 tbc\n\n1 tbc 1 tbc 1 tbc 1 tbc 1 tbc 1 tbc 1 tbc 1 tbc 1 tbc 1kg 1kg\n\n1kg 1kg 1kg 1kg 1kg 1kg 1kg 1kg\n\n1kg 1kg 1kg Nick Levery. Welcome to the show, man. Thanks for having me, Rilla. It's an honor. So, you're the only active duty guy that I've ever had on. You're still active. Correct. Is an SF guy. Chief Warren Officer. Correct. It'll probably be the last one that I have to. Until we don't get very many active guys.\n\nSure. Wanted to come on, actually, I've never had one. But so I want to just run through, I want to run through your entire career as much as you can. With the audience, I just want everybody to keep in mind that Nick is an active, you're on an active ODA, active SF guy. Topics can be limiting because you are still active and you're in it. We'll definitely respect that. If we do happen to go into anything\n\nthat you're uncomfortable, then just let us know and everybody gets it. And before we go any farther, I just wanna say thank you for your service. I know that's weird to hear, but. No, I appreciate it. Likewise, man. Perfect.\n\nThank you, man. But so, objective, secure. Yeah, man. New book came out what a couple of months ago? Yeah, late January. How's that doing? It's doing well. Is it?\n\nYeah, man. And you asked me that question. Kind of when I first got here, and I based my response to that question solely off of the feedback that I've been given from those that have checked it out and read it, and through that lens it's been absolutely tremendous. What kind of feedback are you getting? Yeah, man. So, you know, it can vary kind of from the one end of the spectrum to the other.\n\nSomething as simple as, hey man, I took something that you wrote about and I recently applied it to my life in terms of setting goals and achieving goals. So thank you for that, which is great. And then I kind of on that father out of the spectrum, even just recently, about a couple weeks ago, I got an email from a woman who told me that her husband had attempted suicide a few months back. He failed at it, fortunately. He was on a real destructive path.\n\nHe stumbled upon my Instagram or something, found the book, she bought him the book, he took a look at it and he's made relatively of a 180 and he's doing really well. Now I don't claim to be like the catalyst for that but from her perspective myself and what's in this in this book was a part of that process for that individual and that's quite powerful man you know you get a message like that from somebody, and you're able to really reach out and touch somebody and positively affect someone's life.\n\nSo kind of the entire range of the spectrum, but it's been really humbling, and that's an honor to be part of people's process. That's amazing. You know, the other thing is you're the first amputee that I've had on here. And I've been looking for the perfect guy or woman vet to come on here and share their story with the audience because it's, I mean, I can't imagine the stuff that you've\n\ngone through and the rehabilitation. And for that a lot of guys that have had a lot of struggles with separation and transition out of the military. And I mean, what you have been through without a doubt has got to be one of the toughest things to overcome. And so I just have a tremendous amount of respect for you and for that to happen and then to still be an active green beret, it just speaks volumes of who you are as a man.\n\nI appreciate it, man. So, thank you. Yeah, but we'll get into all that a little bit later, bud. So, tell us a little bit about the book. What was your goal in writing the book? Yeah. I first I'll start off by saying what it isn't. And it's not an autobiography.\n\nIt's not my memoirs. And it's also not a story or a group of stories in combat, right? Like the buried up to our knees and hand grenade pins type story. That's not what it is. And I think oftentimes when you see a military author, that's kind of your general thought that that's what the book's gonna be about.\n\nAnd there's some amazing stories out there that I've read. That is not what this project is. The short answer of what it is, it's a personal development piece. And really, I think the greatest way to explain it is to just briefly talk on the genesis of it, how it became a thing. And if you go back, which we'll get into\n\nfollowing my first deployment as an APT. Coming back from that, it was publicized pretty rapidly. It was unprecedented for that to have happened, so it caught a lot of people's attention. As things progressed, and I became more involved in social media and kind of gradually being comfortable with putting myself out there into the public space, the questions that come in, mostly revolving around to one being, why do you still do what you do, given what you've been through, and then how did you do that? How were you able to function on a special forces detachment\n\nwith one leg? Two reasonable questions. And I'm responding consecutively, boom, boom, boom, boom, and after a couple hundred or a thousand of me basically writing the same thing over and over and over again, over the course of a year. So I decided to just jot this down into a word document product solely for the sake of efficiency.\n\nSo that when that question comes in, I can just copy, paste, attach, send, and then there you go. There's your response. So it was about efficiency. And then it was also about taking an actual closer look at what that process looked like for me. So I kind of grew in a sense because of me doing that right, I really analyzed like how did I do what I\n\ndid and how do I do what I do now. And it was short man, it was maybe 8, 9, 10 page Microsoft Word doc, nothing fancy, boom, boom, boom, kind of outwind the process. And I used it that way for about a year or so in a little longer. And fast-forward to 2020, right? Summer of 2020, COVID is going crazy, right? People are working from home, people at telework and even us in the military, which is a strange time for everybody. And I was about a week out from graduating dive school down in Key West, which I'm sure we'll talk about as well.\n\nAnd a really good body of mine. Been one of my best friends for 20 years, went to college together, played football together in college, he calls me up and he says, hey man, there's something I want to talk to you about. I got about a week left at dive school and I'm an absolute train wreck, right? Physically, mentally, I'm just beat to shit. So I'm in no condition to have any kind of serious conversation with anybody at this point\n\nI might hit me up, you know, in a week when I get home and he does and short version of the story is His mother's been in the book industry her whole life worked with different publishers worked as a librarian and He brings it to me and says, hey man, I think you need to write a book. And I'm like, get out of here. Now I'm not doing that.\n\nWhat would I even write about? What are we talking about? My initial thought was he wanted me to do, you know, the Nicklavery story, like an autobiography, and I had no interest in doing something like that. So I'm like, get out of here. He's like, no man, I really think you need to think about this. And as one of my best friends, I had a respect to him. I said, okay, I'll mold it over, fine.\n\nAnd over a few days, I thought about this word document that I had sitting on my computer. I'm like, you know, I kind of already have something on paper that I did put a lot of time into, an affid and energy, that's been working. I've been using it, and it's been effective. The feedback from this has been positive. So we get back on the phone, and I said, you know what, man, I've been using it, and it's been effective. The feedback from this has been positive. So we get back on the phone and I said, you know what man, I kind of already have something. It's about 10 pages, but there's something there.\n\nI know there's something there because I've felt and seen the results of it. And he's like, keep going with it. Now again, we're in the middle of 2020, it's COVID. I got a lot of extra time on my hands and energy that I normally would be spent in the gym, which they were closed, that I normally would be at work working 12 hour days, but now we're doing crazy,\n\non-off schedules, limited time in the office. So I had extra time and energy on my hands, which I took advantage of, and I just began writing. And if you had asked me a Week before that point if I enjoyed writing the answer would have been no, but having Put myself into that position I caught the bug for it man, and it became one of those things that you know I'm waking up at three o'clock in the morning and I just have to get out of bed and write and I caught I caught the fever and I had a backstop of December\n\nof that year when we were on our next rotation end. And I kind of gave myself that time frame to see what I could come up with. And it got to the point where I was doing five, 600 words a day, borderline obsessive, probably completely obsessive. And fast forward two, three months from that point, and I'm sitting at 70 you know, 70,000 words. Wow.\n\nNow you're looking at something that actually has the contents of a book. And at that point it was just a matter of getting it, you know, polished, learning the process of self-publishing. How do you get it out there? How do you create a cover? How do you create the layout? So learn that and then hit the send button, man. Man, that is, are you still writing every day?\n\nI write every day, yeah. I write every day, there's something great about it in terms of from an analytical perspective, looking at what we've done, what we're doing, how we're doing it, and documenting that process, which for me began with just my training log in the gym, like sets and reps, 10 years ago with sets and reps, and grams of protein has morphed into something\n\nwith much more substance journaling, right? And then more creative writing. So I do write every day, because it's got that analytical value that I enjoy, but it's also therapeutic for me as well, which has become a great mechanism for me to leverage in terms of maintaining my own mental wellness and well-being. Yeah, man, there's a lot of guys that I've been friends with that say that they get a lot of therapeutic value out of out of journaling\n\nI haven't started it yet. I the only thing I've ever journaled is my my psychedelic experience But um, but I should probably start There's a lot of value in a man and I know for you know for us type a's us warriors You look at journaling as this kind of like soft task to do. I'm a warrior, I'm not going to write in my diary. It's like a sense of weakness that's associated with doing that. But if you can force yourself to go down that road, allow yourself to be vulnerable, even with just yourself, you don't need to start publicize it.\n\nBut it's one of the first things I typically recommend, guys that are struggling with whatever it may be. It's like, are you writing? Are you writing stuff down? Most time the answer is no. I'm like, give a shot. Yeah. No, give a shot.\n\nTo kind of about five minutes a day and just throw some words on a page and just see where it goes. Yeah. I'm gonna start doing that. But, um, all right, let's, so kind of how I want to do this interview, I think I already said this, but want to do your life story, get into as much as your career as possible. But before we do that, everybody always gets a present. So, all right. Yeah, so Merry Christmas. Merry Christmas. Awesome.\n\nChristmas theme box, too. That's right. Perfect. Are we open right now? Open it up. What do you got any guesses? I'm guessing it's some kind of a peril. Man, my way off.\n\nWay off. I mean, wrap this thing up. Like just shipping it off the NASA. That's right. What's gonna get? We're just gonna get savage of this thing here, man. Some gummies, we were just talking about the gummies. There you go. Yes.\n\nNow you got some. Look at this. This is awesome, bro. Yeah. You know who's gonna go bananas over this? This is my five year old. Yeah. He's gonna immediately assume that that came home\n\nwith some presents for him. I appreciate it bro. Yeah my pleasure. Thank you. My pleasure. Those are hard to come by. Yeah. Right?\n\nThese are hard to come by. But um, so I try to, I always take questions from my patrons. Patrons are my biggest supporters over a vigilance lead Patreon and I always give them an opportunity to ask the upcoming guest a question. Sometimes we get a lot of questions, some times we don't. I do want to go through a Q&A with you after this, this for Patreon only.\n\nBut this one's from Barron Smith. And I was a little hesitant to ask you this, but I do think it's actually a good question that's something I never would have thought of. He's asking, when you became an amputee, when you lost your leg, now, is there anything, did you find any benefits at all from that experience?\n\nGreat question. Any positivity that came out of that? Yeah, a ton. We could probably spend an hour on that. And I'll just start off by saying that I firmly believe that there is positivity to extract from the worst of circumstances, the worst of events. I think it's simply a matter of time to be able to see them. We'll get into some of that too,\n\nwith some of the more traumatic events that I've been through within my military career, but there is positivity to extract. And I certainly grasp a lot from this. If I were to hop on, you know, maybe one or two, first would be efficiency. and the best way to describe this is you know when you put a prosthetic on your body imagine a clock that starts to tick immediately the second you put it on clock starts to tick at some\n\npoint you will have to take that limb off of your body right and at that point you will be less capable, more than likely, to do what you do on two feet, or at least things will change. So clock starts to tick, and the speed in that clock ticking is based on a whole variety of factors, but most significantly, level of activity in temperature, rather than the primary ones.\n\nThose of us that operate with a prosthetic that has an actual socket, that your residual limb goes into, sweat is the ultimate enemy for an amputee that is, or anyone with a prosthetic that is working with a traditional socket type system. Everything starts to get slippery, it's that's the slide around. These things are shaped\n\nto your limb under normal circumstances, but just imagine when you're in a pool of water for an extended period of time, you know, your fingers start to prune, your skin starts to get damp, moist, feathery, that happens to the limb itself based on the sweat. So it's that the fit starts to get worse over time. Pain starts to increase, functionally starts to decrease. So that clock will start to speed up based on level of activity and temperature and then a variety of other variables. So I realize very quickly that I needed to maximize as much as possible\n\nwhat I'm able to do while I have the leg on my body. And that's amplified when you live a very physical lifestyle, physically training, obviously my job in the military is one that's physical, we spend a lot of time outside where it's hot. So just dissecting, minute by minute, hour by hour, what am I doing once I get upright and making that as efficient as possible,\n\neliminating as much white space as possible. And it got to the point where I was, I was almost OCD about it, where if I would, if I would grab some items to leave my house and then I got to my truck and realized that I forgot something, I was kicking myself when he asked, because now I gotta go back and I gotta get it, right?\n\nThose are 15 steps that I'm not getting back because I was inefficient, so I need to update that system to make this as streamlined as possible. So I got OCD admittedly, drove my wife crazy at times, she's gotten used to it now. So just efficiency being one and then the second I'll just touch on is resilience, man. And this began from the moment I got my leg for the first time, you know, the the second time in my life where I took my first steps. And you get set up with this thing, you have no idea\n\nhow it's gonna work, how it's gonna fit, it's brand new, I'm 30 years old at the time. Got a lot of life experience with two limbs, now I'm down to one, and they set you up in these parallel bars in the prosthetic office, just for something for you to hold onto while you're taking your first steps, right, for the second time.\n\nAnd prostitutes straps it on, he's like, okay now go ahead and walk. Like that was his instruction. And I'm looking at him, I don't know, how do I operate this thing? I don't know what is all this. He's like, just go ahead and take a step. So I'm fumbling around, I'm gripping\n\nwith as much strength as I can. Right, I'm nervous, I'm scared. Family members are there. Eventually I figured it Right, I'm nervous, I'm scared. Family members are there. Eventually I figured it out, I kind of kick it forward. I'm all awkward, you know, I'm all messed up. Eventually I started to get a bit of a rhythm. I'm going down, I'm going back, I'm going down, I'm going back, I'm loosening up that grip\n\non those parallel bars, I'm feeling more confident. I'm like, oh wow, I can do this. Okay, things are good, I'm getting more and more confident and loosening up next thing. You know, I'm not holding on to the bars at all. I'm just going down and back, down and back. And then the inevitable, of course, happens, which is me falling flat on my face. Right? Leg kicks out. When the leg goes one way, I go the other way. Boom. And I look up at my prostitutes. Who knew this was coming, right? And he said, okay, now get yourself back up. And I just like to use that story because not only did he teach me in that moment physically,\n\nhow to get back up off the ground as a one-legged guy, but more so, the mentality behind getting knocked down, falling down on your ass, right? Feeling embarrassed, feeling like you just failed, um, having a whole bunch of doubts coming into your mind. All that stuff starts to come bombing in in that one moment in time and being able to get back up and go again. Damn, dude. That may be one of the most powerful fucking things that have ever been said on this show. Yeah, it paints a great picture. I know it's really difficult to conceptualize what it's like to lose a limb. Right, I couldn't\n\ndo it until I lived it. But I think a lot of people can just put themselves in that position about trying to function with a robot, a appendage for the first time, you know, and then wiping out massively. And what that can do to you, because whether or not you have lost the limb or not, we've all been knocked on our ass to varying degrees of severity and having to find the will and the physical means to get back up and keep moving. So I think it's relatable to a wide audience. Yeah definitely\n\ndefinitely. Wow. Well let's let's go ahead and start with your stories. So I can tell by your accent, you grew up in South Texas. Yeah, right, just kidding. Actually, yeah, a little town outside of Little Rock, down in Arkansas, is where I call home. But seriously, where did you grow up? What was family life like? Yeah, man, I claim Boston Mass, because that's where I spent most of my time as a child and as an adolescent.\n\nThe truth is I'm a nomad of Massachusetts and myself, my parents, and my youngest sister. We moved about every 12 months. I think 18 months was the longest I was in, any single location for any given time. And most of that was based on my parents, two young parents, my father had me when he was 21. And struggling, grinding it out with two young kids. So a lot of job transitions. And then therefore, geographic changes,\n\nbased on what they were doing to survive and to feed us. And they did an amazing job at that. So I moved around a lot man north north of Boston, south of Boston and we can circle back to this Sean but you know that process if I put myself on the couch played an enormous factor in even specific events years later, like in combat, like specific moments, I can unpack that to the way I was raised and the experience I had as a young person moving that frequently.\n\nBeing the new kid in school every year. Damn, it's difficult, right? What did your old man do? He did a lot of different. Whatever he could find. Things, yeah, a lot of different things from it could find. Things. Yeah. A lot of different things from working in that place is like FedEx and UPS to work in different other factories, distribution warehouses. My mother was mostly in the social support industry where she worked at different shelters.\n\nShe worked as a teacher. So different specific industries so different specific industries, different specific jobs, wherever they could find the work that they needed to support us, and they did. And you know, back then, man, the term bullying wasn't taken as seriously as it is today. Back then, when I was a young kid, it was kinda just pot of growing growing up and it wasn't looked\n\nat with the level of granularity that it's looked at now and the type of psychological impacts it can have on young people. And I experienced that. You know, when I was, people see me now and they tend to have a difficult time grasping this, but I was a really small kid. I was a, I was a peanut was a I was a peanut really peanut. Yeah peanut little dude eventually late high school I hit this like ridiculous crow spurt and shut up but I was really small kid I was a new kid every single year getting picked on difficult time making\n\nfriends difficult time keeping friends you know self-esteem really really low that was just how to grown up though for me. And I obviously struggled through it. So I moved around a lot as a kid. I ended up going to high school in Dorchester, which is a burrow just connected to Boston. And that was when I started looking at the military. I think it was my sophomore year high school.\n\nI started looking at the Marine Corps. And that was kind sophomore year high school. I started looking at the Marine Corps. And that was kind of a general direction that I had to go in. And that was based solely off of commercials, right? Yeah. The Marine Corps has historically been phenomenal with their marketing. They still have today.\n\nVery enticing. You can see even that dress class A uniform they have. It's crisp, it's clean, it's captivating. It's not done by accident. And the commercial I ever forget with this guy climbs this mountain and he breaks out this sword and he takes down this like lava monster and he snaps around, he's in the dressing uniform\n\nand I'm like as a young kid, you know, sophomore in high school, I'm like, this is the ultimate badass. I think I wanna be that guy, you know? So striving to be, you know in a warrior and striving to be strong and striving to be respected, all can be generated by my time as a kid where I was a scared young insecure child.\n\nAnd I was striving for that level of respect and authority and strength. And I was drawn to the Marine Corps as a sophomore in high school. One year one day I skipped school, I go downtown Boston, I meet with the Marine Corps recruiter and he says, yeah man, you know, graduate high school and then come back and we'll get you taken care of. So I had kind of a general direction at that point. Yeah. The only thing that I was really interested in as a kid and through high school was athletics. You know, that was the one thing that I had no matter where we lived, there were athletic programs.\n\nSo that's really where I dove in, where I spent most of my time. I played just about every sport there is, you know, in high school, football, cross, ranch rack, wrestled, played basketball. Football was ended up being my primary sport sport and that's the one thing that derailed me from going into the Marine Corps at a high school was I started getting recruited to play football in college. Oh shit you were good at it. I was good enough. I was good enough to get recruited by D2 and D1 AA programs. Wow. So I ended up going to college and went to UMass Lowell, which is a D2 program,\n\nsolely because I got recruited to play football. I was not an academic. I struggled through high school in terms of my grades and taking studying seriously. I despised it. I did just enough to be able to stay on, you know, on the team. So, uh So footballs were brought me to college. So I went to college. This is in 2000. And then sophomore year was 9-11. So the very beginning of my sophomore year college was September of 2001.\n\nSo I'm on the way to class one day and every which was kind of rare for me, but I'm on the way to class. Ah! And everyone is heading back towards the dorms. Just droves, students, I stop one dude, I'm like, what's going on? He's like, all the classes are canceled.\n\nAnd I'm excited. I'm like, perfect. I didn't want to go anyway. I'm already mapping out the rest of my day. How am I just gonna waste the rest of this day? And I head back to the dorm. So obviously I snap on the television and the same thing is on every single channel\n\nand that's when things got real. Once I was able to process what I was seeing, I was angry, man. I was really angry. And I didn't grow up in a military family, so I didn't have this sense of patriotism, like buried into me as a child. But by the time I was in college, 18 years old at this point, I was very proud to be an American and the red-white and blue meant something to me. And seeing that happen infuriated me. I felt like the planes were flying into my body physically was the level of frustration that I had. And it was, how fucking day you just do this. Yeah.\n\nHow fucking day, do you know who you're fucking with, pardon my language, but if I'm being authentic, that's what I'm thinking. Do you know who you just fucked with? Is what I'm thinking? I and we are gonna hunt you down and fucking annihilate you in your entire lineage. This is my thought process at that point.\n\nAnd I really struggled to stay in school because I knew what was going to happen. And I wanted to be a part of that. Straddle to stay in school. I ended up meeting and talking to some mentors and some family. And I ended up deciding to stay in and grind out the rest of my degree, which I did. I ended up earning my bachelor's degree in criminology. And then immediately after graduate,\n\ngraduate in college, I started looking at options too, to enlist. Where did you start? Did you start with the Marine Corps again? Or... I didn't. I started with the Navy. You started with the Navy? I wanted to be a seal.\n\nNo shit. Started with the Navy. And, you know, similar to the Marines in a lot of ways. When you think of, now my education has come along quite a bit. Since my sophomore year at high school, now I just graduated college. I'm 24 years old, right? The internet is now a thing. Access information is now a thing, right? At that point in time, which isn't much different than it is now. When you think of like the ultimate\n\nbadass, the Navy SEALs come to mind very, very quickly. And that's what happened to me. And I said, I want to be in special operations. I want to be a seal. I want to be at the front of this fight. So I walked into a recruiter station in Boston, and they had three branches in the same building. They had the Navy, the Marines, and the Army. And I went in that order.\n\nI walked in the Navy office first and talked to a recruiter and said, hey, man, I want to be a seal. He said, great. Let's get you enlisted into the Navy and then you can place a request to, you know, go to Buds and go that route. And I said, okay, thank you, and I left. And I went to the Marine Corps office. I had the same exact conversation, and I essentially got the same exact answer. I said, thank you, and I left. I went to the Army office, and I got a different answer when I walked into the Army's office. He said, we actually have a program called the 18XRA program, otherwise known as the Special Forces of Recruit Contract Option,\n\nwhich gives guys off the street the chance to bypass the conventional Army and go straight into Special Forces. I said, okay, I think I'm interested in that, but let me go home and do some homework. So I left, I went home and I just got on the Google machine and I started looking up like, what do Korean Berets do? I really didn't know. At that time, I John Wayne, right, Rambo, I've seen stuff in movies, but I really didn't have an education on specifically what these different units did. So I just dug in and just spent the next day\n\nto researching what these entities do. And although the Army gave me the fastest route to get into SF, into SOF. It was the mission that I was also drawn to more than the other options, and that primarily being on conventional warfare, which is a very sexy term. There's a ton that goes into it. And even just on the unclassified side,\n\nyou start to extract and peel back the layers of what UW is. There's a lot of really interesting and enticing stuff within that. So I was drawn to that. I said, okay, I think this is the route I want to go. This is the mission I want to execute. And it gets me there doing it the fastest. So that was the, that was the ultimate route that I went.\n\nIs there one particular thing about unprofessional warfare of the culture attention? I think it was probably the term denied area, which is where the definition ends, right? Activities, blah, blah, blah, blah, in denied area, you know, verbage like sabotage, subversion, resistance movement, insurgency, like these terms jump out. But when you think about operating in a denied area, that was\n\nenticing to me. And then within that, I eventually learned more about the OSS during World War II. Interesting. When the JEDBIRG teams jumped in behind enemy lines into France to set the infrastructure, to set the groundwork and the conditions to enable the D-Day invasion. That literally is the origin, the genesis of Army Special Forces, comes from the OSS, you know Colonel Aaron Bank He was a member of one of those jedberg teams and at the conclusion of World War II He recognized that there was a value there that needed to be maintained and grown And then in 1952 the United time special forces became a thing\n\nSo when you look, you know again answered the question I looked at denied area and that kind of led me down the learning more about the history of the OSS and what they did and the way that they did it, that's kind of what closed the deal. Interesting. Yeah. Being the fact that you graduated from college, did you look at going the officer route? I did only because my recruiter mentioned it to me. You said, you know, you can go the OCS route and become an officer because you have your college degree.\n\nThe 18-X-ray contract is not an option to become an officer. If you want to be an SF officer, you have to enlist, go through whatever means you go through to get your commission and then spend time in the conventional army and then you can drop a packet to go to selection. Did you said no interest in that? Zero. And you know, I was, I'll say I was inaccurate. There's some accuracy to this, but my perception at that time was that officers were the guys sitting behind desks telling other people what to do. And the enlisted guys were the guys that were physically doing it, which is true in a lot of sense in a lot of ways that is accurate. On an SF detachment, that's not the case, right? The captain, the detachment commander, the team leader is right there doing the stuff with the boys. But that was my perception at that time and I wanted to be, I wanted to be one of the guys doing the thing. Yeah.\n\nI wanted the guys telling someone else to do the thing. You want to get your hands dirty? Oh, yeah. Absolutely. Well, that definitely happened. It did. I got, I got what I asked for, man. Yeah.\n\nSo how long after you made your decision, did you join? Was it immediately? It was pretty quick. Yeah, man, I don't remember the exact time frame, but I signed that contract and I was heading down to Fort Benning for basic within a month or two. Pretty fast. Yeah, I was pretty fast.\n\nWhat did your parents think? Scared? I laughed because my parents are my biggest fans right now and they they live Green Beret history and they're all into what we do and how we do it to the best of their abilities. I laughed because I'm 24 years old I'm a college graduate okay I'm a man with some life experience. I had made my decision and I call my father and I tell him, who's my best friend in this world? Because again, we're not that firing age.\n\nSo he's my father, but he's my best friend. I call him up and I say, hey, dad, I made a decision, this is what I'm gonna do. I'm going 18x, very special forces to recruit and then listen to the United States. I'm gonna get myself to the front of this fight as fast as humanly possible. And his response to me was, no, you're not.\n\nHey! He said, no, you're not. No, you're not. He said, no, you're not. And I said, Dad, listen, man, I love you, but I'm not asking you for your permission. This is, I'm just telling you what I'm gonna do. So in his mind, he's like, he's my father. So he's like, just trying to send me to my room. You know, go to your room and think about what you just said.\n\nYou know, kind of thing. Which came from a place of concern and fear, right? Because he saw what was going on. He knew where I was going. Yeah. And he's, you know, he's my father and my mother, right? So they were, they were, they were petrified of what was going to happen. Fast forward again, you know, today, today.\n\nAnd they're obviously extraordinarily proud, you know, they're they they will bleed to keep the stripes on the flag red Based on you know mostly the work that I've done and being alongside me during during the entire journey. Yeah, that's awesome. No Well going into your military service. So you sign the contract. You're gonna go to the SF program What's that? What does that pipeline look like? Yes, so it's it's changed multiple times since then this is back in 07 and Basic training which technically is called one station unit training or OSIT for X-rays were, and also for infantrymen, that are gonna go basically back to back.\n\nSo rather than going to basic training and then going to AIT, which is advanced individual training, where you learn your actual job or your MLS, they're combined. So at the time, I think it was 16 or 17 weeks straight at Fort Benning, You go basic straight into AIT, knock that out and then from there you just go right down the street of Fort Benning to Airborne School, knock that out. And then from there head to Fort Bragg to begin the\n\nSF pipeline process. And I'm quite certain it still exists today. The name has probably changed. But at the time it was called called Sopsy and of course an acronym stands for Special Operations Preparatory Course. And it was this, I think it was a five week or six week block of training specifically for X-rays to help get us ready for selection. An enormous asset to take advantage of over guys that are already in the Hami that don't have that. Those guys still have to work and do their job and then get ready for selection. We had the chance for this program, which was great, and it was mostly just a bunch of PTs,\n\nland nav, not time, some SF history type stuff, but it was very physical. You'd go down to four, you'd leave four Brad, go down to Camacall, be there Monday to Friday, come back for the weekend, and then repeat for five, six weeks. Well, at the end of the first five days that I was in SOPSY, our lead instructor came down and said, okay, we have a selection class that's beginning next week, and they don't have as many bodies as they can hold. So who wants to go to selection early? And I was like immediately like, yep, like I'm ready to go. Like I feel confident that I'm ready to go right now. So myself and then another like six or seven dudes left sobsy after just the first week and\n\nthen we were in selection that following Monday. So it was kind of a fast turnaround yeah but I've been mentally preparing for this for quite a while right. Yeah so I was I was ready to go I was primed and ready to go at this point I was 25 years old I have to make it through all the stuff prior to that so I was ready to go I was excited I I bombed into selection with the highest level of confidence, probably more borderline, if not completely cocky, that I would annihilate it. Went through selection, which at the time that I went was 14 days, got that done, and then straight into the Special Forces Qualification course, mostly referred to as the Q-Course.\n\nSpecial Forces Qualification Course, mostly referred to as the Q-Course. And at the time for us, us meaning the weapons guys, the Kamau guys, and the engineers, that the Q-Course could take anywhere from 12 to 15 months was the time frame if you just went straight through. That's how long it would take. For the medics, it was even longer because they had an additional like nine months of medical training in their MOS phase on top of all the other stuff.\n\nSo I was in the Q-Course 4 and it had been a little over a year. And then I was assigned to third special forces group as an 18 Bravo, which are the weapon sages. And I signed into group the beginning of 2010. Let's go back to selection. We just breeze through all that. So selection, can you give a brief description of what selection actually is for people\n\nthat aren't that familiar with the top, with the pipeline? Yeah, yeah. Special forces, assessment and selection, you know, it's what it sounds like. It's really the chance for the cadre to determine if the individual has the foundational character traits and physical capabilities to be trained into a grimberet. How long is that process? When I went it was 14 days.\n\nIt's 14 days? I think now it's closer to 20. Okay, 2021. It's fluctuated as they've kind of played around with it a little bit. Immediately before I went, it was 20 days. And I want to say I was the second or third class after they had cut it down by a week, down to 14. And you would think that that\n\nmeant that they just removed six to seven days worth of stuff. But what they really did was just sandwich it into a 14-day period as opposed to a 21-day period. Oh wow. So the downtime that you would have in between evolutions and iterations basically disappeared. And they ran it that way for a while. And I think that over time, the data showed that it was just slightly too aggressive of an opt-empo for that amount of time. And they were breaking dudes off unnecessarily. That would be viable candidates, great candidates,\n\nbecause it may have just been a little too much. Yeah, it was a lot. And what that looks like is, it's a lot of physical assessments, some even basic, just your basic, army physical fitness test, a variety of other physical tests. It's heavy on rucking, right? You have a rucksack on your back, most of the time, which is kind of connected to the SF lineage of being entirely self-sufficient and requiring minimal, if any,\n\nsupport to conduct operations. You have what you can carry in on your body. So they really So they really amplify that based on historic operations and the way we oftentimes do conduct operations. And it's really leadership heavy as well, is what they're evaluating on is leadership. And not solely one's ability to effectively lead once you are put in that position, because those positions will rotate day to day, you know, now you're in charge, you're in charge, you're in charge for this thing. Not only your ability to lead, but also your ability to support a leader,\n\ntwo very different things, so they're looking at your abilities to do that. And then lastly, I'll just say on the more technical side, land navigation is a big portion of that. Can you navigate, dismounted, cross-country, on foot at night with nothing more than a map, a compass, an approach actor? Yeah. Man, that's pretty smart that they're looking at how can you support a leader? I've not heard anybody else doing that and maybe they're doing that and I just never picked it up But I think that would be definitely beneficial for all branches\n\nBut what when you say what what would they just create a scenario for you as a leader? And what would that scenario look like to see I I mean, if they're assessing how you're going to lead, how do they do that? I'll just say that they do take a chunk of time where they group the students and the candidates together to work as a unit and solve problems under extreme physical and mental dress. Problems that are, I'll go ahead and say, unsolvable. And it doesn't take much time to recognize that. As a candidate, like what you just asked us to do is as close to impossible as it gets. I know that.\n\nTherefore, okay, I see what like this really is about here. It's not about can I get from pointing to point B successfully within the allot of time. It's about how do we interact as a unit? During that process knowing that what we're trying to do is not going to happen. Very interesting. No. How many guys were in selection? Roughly. My class had around 300. 300? Around 300. That started on day one and I want to say around 90 made it to the end and then out of that 90 they actually selected maybe 40 40 totally shit so it's a pretty high attrition rate yeah I was not expecting that number you know 300 guys wow yeah what did you find to be The toughest portion, well for one on the physical side, I did not properly plan\n\nfor no deal with my feet. Foot hygiene is a very real thing. And it's not just keeping them clean, like bathing your body, but keeping them in working condition. I, my stubbornness and immaturity as blisters would begin, I just kind of put on this, like let's just suck it up and keep going forward kind of thing. Strong range of versus smart range of. And I let it get to the point\n\nwhere it almost forced the cadre to remove me from training because my blisters on my little pinky toes were so badly infected and raw that the medic took a look at him and was like, I may have to remove you. So just improper planning, I'm failure to recognize the need to take care of this machine that is my body,\n\nkeep it in working condition. Same way I take care of my rifle, I need to be taken care of my body. So the pain and discomfort at that point, this is towards the end, was quite high. I brought that on myself. And then from a leadership perspective, we talked about that was challenging for me as well. You know, being an aggressive, like dominant type personality,\n\nwhen you see what you firmly believe, right, looks like, and someone else sees it differently, I had struggled with accepting that. So in terms of being evaluated as your ability as a Lita and your ability to lead, but then conversely your ability to effectively support and enable and influence a Lita, I struggled on that side of the house where I was like, no, that's wrong.\n\nI'm right and you're wrong and I know that. So, like, let's get to the finish line. Yeah, like, I was like, we can do this if we do what I think is right. And, you know, that's just, that's not the case. So that was a struggle for me, but at large, man, it, I thought it would be worse than it was. Really? I thought it would be worse than it was. Really?\n\nI thought it would be worse than it was. I think I just put it on such a high pedestal that it was in this kind of unrealistic stratosphere of pain and suffering and difficulty. It just didn't lead up to how challenging I thought it was going to be. Interesting. How many guys did you go through that with, like, did you have any friends that were in there with you, and did they make it?\n\nYeah, I did. Actually, some guys that I was even in basic training with were in my selection class. It was a real small group because like I said, Sopc, they only plucked like five or six or seven of us from that class early. I knew all of those guys because we had been together the entire time, from basic to airborne, to Fort Bragg, to SOPSY, and now we left early to go to selection. So I did know a handful of dudes, and I want to say all of them were selected at the end.\n\nWow. Yeah, that's impressive. I think so. Yeah, that's real impressive. Well, let's take a quick break and then when we get back, let's go into the cue course and what that was like. Let's do it. How you got through that. Go. When my wife and I started planning to start a family, we took care of everything. The nursery, our wills, our power of attorney, literally everything. Or so we thought, the one thing we forgot about was life insurance. It was something that just sounded like a lot more work for us in time that we didn't have to spend on it.

You just graduated or not graduated, got selected. Is that correct? Yeah selected and now you're going to the Q course So let's pick up right there Yeah Q course at the time when I went through You would go down to Kemp McCall from Bragg proper\n\nfor you know a chunk of time Whatever phase you were in, and that could be a couple of weeks, two weeks, three weeks, six weeks, nine, whatever. And then you would come back to brag and just kind of be in a holding pattern until the next phase initiated. And that's what that looked like.\n\nSo I mean, I ended up taking maybe a year, a little over a year. And at the time that looked like. So, man, I ended up taking maybe a little over a year. And at the time that I went through, scratching through my memory, you kind of begin with kind of a leadership training face that I believe, actually I'm certain, I forget what it was called, but it's what qualified you to become an NCO was the first thing that\n\nyou did. So, to be an SF, it's all, it's an 18 series in SF, to be an SF guy, a team guy. They're all NCOs. So regardless of your rank when you start the Q-Course, you will graduate the Q-Course as a sergeant. So the first phase of that was that kind of collective leadership training or whatever they called it, kind of NCO professional development level two,\n\nwhatever it is, to credential you to become an NCO in the back end of the Q-Course. That was the first phase for us. This is again, back when I went through. Then I believe the next phase was small unit tactics, which kind of mirrors a range of school style, where you conduct squad and platoon ops as a unit, during the field for seven, eight weeks.\n\nThen after that, I believe is when we went to CSQL, um, survive a vague resist escape, uh, that course we went to that. And then I believe after that, we went to language training. What's your language? My language now is Persian Fasi. My language in the Q-course was Russian. Do you speak both? I would say I have a working knowledge of Fasi.\n\nMy Russian has since gone almost completely away. Well, you might need that soon. Possibly. I may have to get back into the books. I don't know why I'm laughing, but Yeah, that could come in handy Maybe it's a random bike. I don't know see if I can't pick it back up So language which for the more difficult languages like your Arabic or your Mandarin or your Russian It was six months in language school. For the easier languages, Spanish, French, you know, like Latin-based languages, I believe\n\nthey went for like four months. Okay. But you go through language phase. Every 18 series guy or girl has to be language qualified. That's like one of the most critical skill sets of an 18 series is to be able to speak a native language based on your area of operation. So, six months of Russian, and then after that was Robin Sage,\n\nwhich is kind of the final culmination exercise within the Q-Course. Still exists now, and it's, you, they create an actual SF-ODA with 12 individuals. Actually, I'm sorry, I forgot my MOS phases in there as well, which I was an 18 Bravo, the which of the weapons sagents. So that was like a 13, 14 week P-O-I\n\nthat you go through to actually learn your job. So once you get to Robin Sage at the end, they put together an actual ODA with the actual and molasses the way an actual team is built. And that's the first time that you really get to experience these other skill sets. Because up to that point, you're just kind of in these stillf pipes as a general candidate\n\nor you're learning a specific job, you get to sage, and now you have an actual team leader, an actual captain, you have the commo guys, you have the medics, you have the engineers that are all on that team,\n\nwhich was really kind of cool. I'll let the forget that. We were actually able to see what these guys can do, like what they learned, and actually able to employ it. Those can do, like what they learned. And we're actually able to employ it. Those commos skills, those demo skills, those medical skills, even for just something as small\n\nas we're doing our initial infill, which is typically hell, where you're, you know, you're rocking over a hundred pounds to get it to your operational area, and you know, your cramp in or you got twist and ankle or something and like a medic shows up. And prior to that point, we had never experienced that. You know?\n\nLike someone's like medic, you know, and like an actual dude shows up, like a medic shows up. So at one point I was cramping and overcomes our medic and he actually like knows medicine. He's like, okay, I'm like, and he actually knows medicine. I'm like, wow, you guys are really a thing. Okay, cool. So it starts to feel real.\n\nYou do exist. Yeah, you guys do exist. This is a real thing. And you kind of experience in, for the first time, what an ODA brings to the table, because you got all these advanced skills within each individual. And then at that, that's the end of the cue course, man.\n\nGraduate, Don J'Barré, and then to the team you go. And then at that's the end of the cue course, man. Graduate, don your beret, and then to the team you go. So I got a couple questions about a cue course. So if you can't answer them great, if not, I totally understand. But so you said you graduated or you got selected with about 40 out of 300 guys. So my thought is, Are they after every selection, is that who is in your cue course, or do they, is it more?\n\nIs it more selections? Do you know what I'm saying? I do. And at the time that I went through, when you had those areas of white space, those gaps in between phases, it was so that other candidates that were coming into the Q-course would\n\narrive and then you could get enough bodies to put into that next phase. So for example, like when we needed to go into SUT, small unitarctics, we would go in, I think it was like 80 or so students. Okay, that would go in at a single time. So you'd have more guys that had just come out of selection or the phase prior to that. But then you'd also be losing guys along the way, guys that didn't make it through the previous phase. So guys were coming and then guys were going\n\nthroughout the duration of my cue course experience. Some were obviously staying with you. Those that just went straight through without any issues But you know injuries happen where guys have to have to recycle a certain phase or guys just flat out get dropped from the course for whatever reason So it is a little bit of a revolving door where people are coming and going but I had you know a good group of dudes That I was with from the very beginning that I ended up graduating with. Interesting. With the, with the, with your job specific training,\n\nyou're an 18 Bravo weapons guy. Or, and I think you said, how long is that? I wanna say when I went through, through was maybe 13, 14 weeks. So are all the different jobs, all the different areas of expertise so they all that same length so you guys jump back in for the Robin Sage together. All except for the medics which was about twice as long. The medical for the medic their MOS phase I want to say was like 12 months or twice as long. The medical, for the medic, their MOS phase, I wanna say it was like 12 months or nine months long.\n\nSo the rest of the groups would be continuing to advance while the medics that you started MOS phase together were still in MOS phase as you're pushing past to the MOS phases. But then also language was thrown in there too. So some of them are six month courses, some of them were four month courses. So by the time you get to the back end of that, now you've got different bodies. Yeah. Because each phase could be a different length depending on\n\nthe MOS and the language that you were learning. This program is a lot longer than I originally thought. Well, now it's much different. I want to say maybe three years ago, they optimized the Q-Cross. And it's much more streamlined now where those gaps that existed in between phases have been drastically reduced, where they're intentionally giving guys enough time to rest and recover, but then they're not waiting for the next group to be able to catch up. So guys are going through the course now Almost as a single entity the entire time unless someone gets dropped for some reason. Okay, so now it's much more streamlined and the likelihood of you starting and ending with the\n\nsame faces is much more likely than it was when I went through. Okay. Did you guys lose a lot of guys? And the Q-course? We did. And that's kind of one of the things that has shifted with the Q-course is, you know, when I went through, there were a whole variety of different gates that you needed to successfully complete. And a lot of ways, it was, you know, 12, 18 month assessment and selection,\n\nbecause there were a lot of different times when you didn't meet the standard and you would have been removed. Now, the Q-Course is looked at more so as a training course where you're there to learn. We've done the assessment and selection on you already. That's what selections for. We've determined that you have the character traits and physical capacity to be molded into an entry-level green beret. And we will do that through the qualification course. We will teach you the foundational aspects of being an SF guy. So it's the attrition rate now in the Q-course\n\nis much lower than or higher than it was when I went through. We lost more dudes in the Q-course when I went through, than is lost now. Interesting. Yeah. How things are evolving. Would you have weapons training?\n\nWhat can we go into that a little bit? What is it daily? What are you doing there? Is it sniper school? Is it, or are you going through all these different weapons systems and you're just becoming an expert on all of them? Yeah, I mean, experts certainly a strong word, but you do gain kind of an entry level knowledge of the majority of the weapon systems that we're going to use at organic to an\n\nODA and or the ones that we would be working with in country alongside of a partner force. So for a variety of different small arms, both domestic and foreign, sniper systems, cruiser weapon systems, sniper systems, and then indirect systems, such as mortars. So you get kind of a baseline understanding of how they function, how to troubleshoot them, and how to incorporate them into training. So the bravo section, the bravo's themselves are kind of your weapons experts on how they work and how to keep them working.\n\nThey're also the primary support function on the team is that of training and operations. So actually planning and executing training as well. So they do give you an introduction into what that looks like, how to actually set up a training event, and then also incorporate all these different weapons systems that we're teaching you how to how to use. If you wanted to go to sniper school, so you're not going to become a sniper during that time. So, say if a communications guy wanted to go to sniper school once he was accepted into the ODA, would he be able to or do they only take bravos? He absolutely could. He could. Absolutely. Yeah, oftentimes we get kind of pigeonholed based on our our MLS on what\n\nadvanced skills is best suited for that individual. There's an argument to be made that if you're a weapons guy you already have a found a solid foundation understanding of how weapons systems work sending that dead dude to sniper school makes a lot of sense because it's obviously it's a weapon. Let's not let's advance this guy's skill set. But also there's an argument to be made to send someone else to bring them more up to speed on how weapons systems that large work. And also if this dude's operating the mortar,\n\nhe can't be operating a sniper rifle. So let's get someone else that knows how to operate that sniper rifle. So we'll send our, you know, our combo guy to sniper school. You'll see the same type of argument when it comes to going to become a JTAC, like a JTAC certified. A lot of times it makes sense to send your Kamo guy to go become a JTAC because he's familiar with operating radio systems. That's what JTACs use. You could also have the same the same argument the other way. This guy is managing comms at large for the\n\ncommander or for the element. Maybe it's best to get someone else who knows how to operate a radio who's been able to do JTACory while our echo while our commo guy is managing kind of general comm systems. So essentially, you are not limited by what advanced skills that you can obtain based on your current MOS. Okay. What other jobs are there? What other specialties are there? We've got weapons, guy, communications, guy. On the ODA? Yeah. Yes, you got your team Lita, your detachment commander, which is a captain, so your officer, you've got an assisted detachment commander, which is filled by a worn officer, which is what my position is. You have your team sergeant, which is your senior enlisted Lita, your highest ranking enlisted guy, who really runs the team, like he\n\nruns the boys, all the Galveston's in the team, like he runs the boys. All the Galvey NCOs in the team, they answer to that man. You have your intelligence sergeant, which is not one that you can obtain in the qualification course. That's something that you would do after the fact. You then have your weapons guys, your combo guys, your engine is, which focus on both\n\nbuilding things and then blowing things up. So demo. Okay, so that would be a breacher. They would be the subject matter expert in breaching and their job is to create breachers on the team. Okay. And then you have your Kamo guys. So that's the just kind of general breakdown of your NCOs, your weapons, or your medics. Your weapons, your Kamo, your engineering, your medics.\n\nThere's two per team, senior in a junior. And then you've got one Intel dude, you've got one assistance attachment, you've got one assistant attachment command, one team sergeant and one captain to make up the 12. Okay. So you finish up the Q course. What's graduation like? You know, at the historic moment, right?\n\nFor every SF guy, it's something that you've been dreaming about putting this little green hat on your head for multiple years, probably. So, yeah, you know, it's exciting, it's like thrilling, and then very quickly after that, you realize that you're back at the bottom of another massive mountain and a lot of uncertainty. It's like things just got real, man. You're no longer a student, you're no longer a candidate, you're the guy. And you knock on that team room door for the first time, nervous, not knowing what to expect. And then real work begins. Yeah.\n\nWhat is being so close with your dad, with your old man, what was his reaction when you told him, hey, I've made it through this pipeline. I'm done. Yeah. Thrilled, you know, he was booked his flight to Fort Bragg for my graduation, probably before anybody else, and extraordinarily proud.\n\nAnd then also nervous, man, because now things are getting real. When you're going through that pipeline, or really any pipeline within SOF, there's a chance that you don't make it through the other end. It could happen to anybody. I think he was confident that I would be successful, but there's still that degree of uncertainty. Whether or not my son is actually going to go to Afghanistan as a green beret, there's a level of uncertainty. He's done that little green half at first time, and now you know what's going to happen. So as proud as he was in that moment, I'm sure that he would tell you that he would also equally petrified.\n\nYeah. So you go to the what what ODA do you go to? I went to um, an ODA and first battalion third group. Okay. Do you guys have any choice in where you're going or it's just manning. This is where you're going. Yeah. That's it. And you know, you show up to group for the first time, especially as an x-ray. I had never even been on like a real like a unit compound before. You just kind of meander and around lost. You get a little bit of guidance, like go check in at the CQ desk up front and look\n\nat your squirt away, but you get this list of in-processing requirements. When I showed up, my entire company was forward in Afghanistan. So there was just a few kind of rear detachment guys that were around that I linked up with on my first day. And they're like, all right, go, you know, go through all the different sections and in process. And I'm like, okay, so I have no idea what any of these things are. Like I got to go to S1, S2, S3. I'm like, what is that? What is that? And so I'm just kind of me wondering around getting a getting familiar with the\n\narea. And I was met my Sergeant Major and he told me the entire company is forward right now, minus one team and they only have about a month left. So we have a couple options here. One is I can wait until these guys get back and then they're going to go into a reset phase and I can put you on one of those teams. Oh, I can put you on this other team that's here now that's set to go over and it was like four or five months. Oh wow. And I say okay and you asked if you had a choice and I really I really didn't I initially but once I got to the company level he brought this to my attention and he's like the team that here, they're a unique team.\n\nThey don't do what the other ODAs do. They're different. And it's not a good fit for everybody. And I said, okay, I had no idea what this guy was talking about. Like I came to group, you know, to kick down doors and shoot back guys in the face. Like that's what I wanted to do, and that's what most of the teams did. This team was a little different.\n\nSo there's a goal of our talk to the team's agent and see if it's a good fit. And I said, okay, I had no idea what to expect. So I do that. And this particular ODA, which is why they deployed on an off cycle from the rest of the company, was because of their actual mission, right? And rather than being a direct action focused ODA, which is what, just about all of our ODAs and their group we're doing, focused on it, which you talk about kind of the lineage we talked about earlier of the OSS and kind of where SF came from. Those guys weren't the ones that were\n\nyou know rating machine gun bunkers. Those guys were the ones that were facilitating those that would be coming in to do that. Preparation in the environment is one of the SF missions that this particular team focused on. So I still didn't quite grasp all of that at that time. I just knew that these guys were the next guys out the door. And I wanted to go. So Team Sajjanae kicked it off. We were good.\n\nHe's like, I'd like you on this team if you want to come do this. And I said, yeah, let's do it. So my first appointment to Afghanistan in early 2011 was on a unique team that was comprised of entirely senior, senior SF guys. That spent a lot of time on kind of more of your traditional SF ODA and then migrated over to do these types of activities later in their careers. Here I come in as a brand new Cherry E5 X-ray with no experience in anything and I am surrounded by dudes that are on there, you know, seventh,\n\neighth combat deployment. A lot of upsides to that, a lot of experience and knowledge for me to attempt to consume, but the bow was also raised really high as this young dude who really didn't know much. Yeah. And it was a nine month rotation, and I'll pause here for just in a second, but I'll just say that I was fortunate to be putting that position, because although I was having to outpace my headlights the entire trip, and I was drinking it through a fire hose, because of the type of team it was, I was exposed to such a wide range of what SF-48 is capable of doing.\n\nAll the way from getting into an armored gun truck with machine gun barrels sticking out everywhere, you know, in multi-cams to go do that kind of thing, to being in a soft skin, corolla, you know, driving through downtown Canada, and then everything kind of in between. So it was a lot to try to take in and process, but I'm fortunate to have been in that position because it opened up my aperture quite a bit from a very early stage in my career to what ODAs can actually do. I think this is when I don't know if you remember, we were co-located together once, is that, was that your first deployment?\n\nYeah. Okay. Can I mention where I was? Yeah, I think so. Spin Bulldog. Yeah. Interesting. Yeah, which is a small while.\n\nI forgot that we had just now before. Yeah. Yeah. So that was your first deployment. Yep. No shit. We were split between spin and then downtown Canada. Our team was. Where'd you like going most? On that deployment. I think I spent most of my time down at spin. I'll say that we had a really great compound, our living conditions were unbelievable,\n\nwhich set me up for failure, not to fast forward to FI, but once I only did that one trip with that team and then I switched when we got back and I went to a DA team and then my subsequent rotation was, you know, doing VSO up in the mountains with nothing. But my first trip was real push. Like we all had our own chew.\n\nI had, you know, full-size bed. I had air conditioning, great food, couple different gyms to choose from. It was like, oh, this is, this is great. This is the way you guys live. This isn't living off the land, right? I might have him catch snakes and eat them for dinner. Like, I got a cell hall right there.\n\nThis is beautiful. You know what I mean? That's the way I lived for nine months and then the root awakening happened. You know, the following year once I went to a different tomb. Well, so I'm really curious if you can go into it because I remember shooting the show with you a couple times, but you guys were like fucking hermets there.\n\nWe never saw you. I don't think you really saw us either, but because of that, I don't know if it's gotten any better, but nobody likes sharing information with other organizations, which I think is ridiculous. That's my opinion, but what were you guys? What were you guys into down there? Yeah, it starts to get pretty sensitive, pretty quick, man. Yeah.\n\nIt makes sense. Well, it's, we'll fast forward then, since that's so sensitive. And so you come back, you go to another team. Yep. How long are you home for? I was home for maybe six months, seven months, but I really wasn't home much in terms of my head\n\non my own pillow. I dove directly into advanced schools and training and then I'm going back overseas once during that time period and then came back. So I want to say it was around seven, eight months that I was I was not deployed in a combat environment or at least I was not on a combat rotation. It's probably the best way to say that. But I wasn't home much, man. I was obsessed with just being the best SF guy I could be, and nothing else really mattered to me much than that. So if I wasn't into school,\n\nI'm in the weight room or I'm on the track or I'm in the fight house or I'm reading training manuals because I knew we were going back to. So I just wanted to go completely all in on that. Makes sense, you know. So you're home for eight months? To my dad. Go right back out the door. That's not long.\n\nI mean, where did you go? That was quick. Yeah, so my second my second combat pump now on this new team DA focus team was in late 2012 and then we went to Wardek Province which is historically known for its heavy fighting. So we got the mission we wanted, that is exactly we wanted three teams went in along the Chalk Valley and Wardak to to conduct our operations and at the time we were doing a lot of teams were doing VSO which\n\nstands for Village Stability Operations, a term that which has since gone away and one that makes a lot of sense conceptually. And the idea behind VSO is, as you go into these areas to link up with your podenforce and conduct operations with these guys, but you can't build up massive infrastructure, you can't build a fob. You have to live and operate within the conditions that they live and operate within. Mostly so that when we transition out, we don't leave behind something that is unsustainable for them. So let's keep the footprint very small. Let's mimic what they do and how they do it, and then build them up based on their abilities to build and grow. Rather than coming in and setting up massive towers and walls and gates and like all this force pro stuff that won't exist when you leave.\n\nThat makes a hell of a lot of sense. It does make a lot of sense and we loved it. It was like the most authentic SF mission that we could get. It's like perfect. Like this is living off of the land. This is living, this is us assimilating to our environment and our partners and then organically and and bilaterally building that up together to whatever degree is sustainable for them. Makes a lot of sense. The the downside, the risk that comes with that is something that can't be ignored because if it's just you guys at a very small footprint and you don't have this infrastructure\n\nto rely on for your own personal security, it exposes you to be vulnerable in a lot of ways. Yeah. But we got, well, that's exactly what we wanted, man. We got exactly what we wanted. And that turned out to be, you know, just a wild, be different type of deployment than my previous one, where I rather than living in a chew with the heat and air conditioning in a bit of full bed with the television, you know, my living quarters is this old half blown out semi-structured\n\nhunk of clay that I'm able to try to get like, talk my head underneath it and like that's where I lived. Yeah. Until we built up something that was, you know, more suited for us, both for us and for them. Was were all three teams co-located at the exact same spot? No, okay. No, no, we were pre-positioned kind of in a triangle, two on one side of the valley and one on the façade. And we really just had each other to support each other for operations.\n\nYou know, there was a large surface-to-air threat in the area at the time, So they were real hesitant in terms of resupply, the frequency into the scale of what they could safely fly in for us. So you're talking like LCLA-type resupply drops, speed balls coming by quick. Like that's how we were resupplied. The occasional convoy would come out, but they would almost always just get obliterated with IDs. Damn, that it just became a point. We can't afford to do this. But you know what, this is why we have ODAs. You guys can thrive in these environments. Yeah. So in a kind of a sick way, even just after a couple of months, we almost wanted like less support. Like leave us alone.\n\nLike we will take care of this ourselves. And just the three ODAs really mutually supported each other most of the time. So we conducted an op, they'd be IQRF. They do one, we'd be their QRF. So we just kind of coordinated with each other obviously through higher, how we would kind of stagger different ops so that we, one of us was around to come in\n\nif we needed to for the other one. Wow. How many indig guys were, roughly, what are you guys were running? Yeah, so that trip, we were potting it up with an A and A ASF team. So Afghan National Army, special forces, detachment, which we built to mimic exactly what an SF-48 looks like.\n\nSame with OSS, same breakdown, carbon copy, so 12 of those guys. And we lived together in the same blown out area that we had as our camp. We lived together. When it came time to run different ops, depending on a variety of variables, more than likely the threat or the size of the objective,\n\nwe would bring in conventional Afghan elements from the Afghan Security Forces elements. So standard Afghan National Army guys, Afghan National Police guys, at that point, there was an African local police force that was also in the area. So at any given moment, we would be conducting ops,\n\nand or training, we would be getting dudes that were coming in from these other elements for us to work with. Is that, is that every operation you would have these outsiders coming in? No. Did that bother you? I mean, because that's, that's, that's,\n\nthat can get tricky. Oh, a lot of guys get, you know, they tip off Taliban, tip off Al Qaeda. Yep. Did that happen? Yeah, yeah, it did. It, of course, made us nervous anytime we would be bringing in these outside units. It's one thing when you're living amongst someone, you know, the threat is mitigated, even\n\njust because you're geographically co-located with them 24 hours a day. These other guys, you have no idea where they're going who they're talking to, you know, to say that the Afghan security forces lacked corruption would be a drastic understatement, you know. So it certainly increased the risk to us by bringing some of these entities in. So based on the objective, the need for additional bodies\n\nwas certainly at the beginning of that, do we need more humans to conduct this up? But you also can't ignore the need to enable and increase report capability amongst the Padaforeora's at Lodge, which is, you know, what ODA is really do. We're trainers and advisors, we're warriors, and we can go in the door when we need to,\n\nbut when you really put an ODA someplace, is because we're forced multipliers, right? So, there was, I wanna say pressure for us to incorporate some of these more conventional elements, but there were times when it was mandated that we would roll with other elements. Even just, I remember, I've not had to do that. I've been co-located, but it's always been, you guys were always there first, and it\n\nbuilt a team, and maybe we took over or whatever. But I remember hearing a lot of different, a lot of times that the green berets co-located with the partner force. Guys were getting killed, you know, interpreters force. You know, guys were getting killed. You know, interpreters are killing you guys, guys on the team are killing you guys. Were you worried about that? Did that happen yet?\n\nIt had happened. And during that time frame, this is now 2012. The insider attack threat was considered to be the greatest threat that we dealt with. Really? As ODA's, yeah. I saw firsthand what that looks like. Yeah.\n\nAnd at the time, I felt like, especially as a bravo, who's one of our primary responsibilities, is based offence. I felt like we had sound TTPs, SOPs, systems in place to mitigate these threats. I was wrong and there were gaps and we paid some heavy costs because of that. We've learned from them since, but the reality is there's no way to eliminate that threat from happening regardless of how many dudes you're working alongside of where they're coming from. The reality is SF ODA is going and we work with indigenous personnel. That's like our job, man. So there are certainly techniques and practices to reduce those threats, but you are going to take on that risk if you wanna do this kind of work.\n\nYeah. How much work are you guys getting there? How much work are you going out? How many hits were you doing? Just about every day. Every day? Yeah, every day is strong. If we would reset as we needed based on how difficult or how taxing the previous hop\n\nmay have been, but multiple times a week for the duration of the deployment and most of which we encounter contact on most of them. Sometimes multiple times a day. Multiple times a day? Yeah. Wow. That's a lot of work. Like I said, I know it's sensitive, but what kind of, what are you guys targeting?\n\nWhat are you looking for? So, one of our primary objectives, again, keep in mind, this is 2011. One of our primary objectives was to open up white space to allow some free movement for our conventional forces to begin to work towards extraction. So opening up roadways and creating a white space bubble of a reduced threat. So some of these entities could get to places like Bogrum or Canada or be able to get to a place to get out of country. 2011, we had decided and we were at least looking at drastically scaling down\n\nin the future, again the coming months. So we needed to create a bubble. We needed to create a bubble. And within our area, when we first got there, there was no bubble. I mean, we got there in the middle of the night, like 2 a.m. got dropped off on the Chinook, set up patrol-based style living situation, complete unknown environment. No team, we didn't rip with a team.\n\nWe were the first team to go to this location. No shit. Yeah, first team at this location So there's nothing now The team there was a team on the ground That was physically there, but they had just got there two days prior or a day prior just to meet the logistics to start pulling them out. So it was like a high five kind of thing.\n\nA couple of their dudes stayed back, a couple of their leaders, senior guy stayed back to give us like a laydown of the land that they knew of for having only been there for like 48 hours, but who was uninhabited proud of us really coming in. So we're there, I think maybe we were there two, three days before we even left our little area.\n\nAnd I will never forget, I think we had like a four, five truck convoy and a couple raises, couple side by side. And I was in the trail vehicle. And my vehicle didn't even get onto the road and we were in contact. Oh wow. So and I'm like, is this seriously happening right now? So we they literally dropped us in the middle of a hornet nest with no white space, no freedom of movement. And our one of our primary missions was to\n\nexpand that us and the other two ODAs along that valley to allow some maneuverability for some of these other units, primarily to give them an option to evacate a country. Holy shit. So you've had, wow, so right off the bat, it's on. Right off the bat. Like welcome to the show. Yeah, and it's kind of that holy shit moment. But then also the, this is exactly where we wanna be right now. So how often were you guys taking contact? Simply every time we went out, most times we went out, at least for the first half the trip. First three months, we were taking contact, just put every time we left our camp.\n\nBut then the winter came in, January timeframe comes in. And when you're at that altitude, the snow is epic. So things, everyone kind of takes a time out. You've heard the term the fighting season, right? So like at that point of time, really no one can move when there's nine feet of snow on the ground and you're in the mountains. So we did kind of go into this six, eight week kind of like hibernation\n\nphase from you know college January through February ish time frame. But up until that point it was it was busy anytime we just about anytime we left we were we were being engaged. How did that first contact feel? It felt good. On that rotation? Yeah. That's the first time you've been in contact, right? No. I was in some prior. Okay. When I was in the year before. So it wasn't my first time,\n\nbut it certainly was my first time with that level of frequency. There was a couple of things that we experienced the year before, but we weren't that trip, we weren't designed to be in those types of fights. It just happened. designed to be in those types of fights. It just happened. That trip, um, it became normal, right? But so, I think just like, uh, uh, uh, an awakening that this is real and you're about to get everything that you ever wanted\n\nor thought you wanted. Yeah. You know, a out of being on a team doing this kind of thing. What was the, what was kind of the, the, um, would you guys pursue the thread or would you break contact? What was, what was the deal that you had? Yeah, man, you know, the, the, the term it depends is, is used a lot, man. It's probably the most accurate. Most of the time we would go into fire maneuver and we would advance. The term the bearded ones was one that was used in Afghanistan for a really long time.\n\nThat term was referencing soft guys. Like guys that were able to grow beids and your conventional guys for a while, if not the entire time they were there, were doing the army thing, right? And they would, if they would engage a standard army or military convoy, most of the time they would kind of circle the wagons, deal with the threat, maybe call on some support, and then rebutton up and then move. Well, they started realizing that if you engage the bearded ones, those guys are going to come after you. So just know what you're getting yourself into. So most of the time we would advance on whatever the threat was.\n\nObviously, if you're dealing with some kind of a TST on an objective that you need to get to, then the commander leadership would make that call. We're breaking contacts so we can continue to chowly mic over to what we really need to do today. So you'd see both. When you guys were taking contact or when you'd walk into an ambush like that, how many guys was it on average? Was it the, you know, you get everything over there. You get the local farmer who's just trying to get his G-Hot on with an AK, then he, all the way up to a full blonde, coordinated ambush.\n\nWhat was typical? I'd say, um, typical would probably be five-six guys. Five-six guys? Yeah. If if I had put a number on it We of course would get the random pop shot from the dude, you know, blah blah blah blah and then he take off and whatever Some larger could more coordinated ones 1215 Individuals say I'd say if I put a norm on it. I'd say probably like five or six as well We'd see on any within any particular engagement. Okay.\n\nMan, how the hell did you guys even, I mean, you get dropped off of the middle of Afghanistan. How do you find... indig... motivated enough that believes in the cause to... I mean, how do you build a team out of nothing? Where do you find these guys? Yes, so on that trip, we didn't need to find recruit and build our Pond of Force.\n\nThey existed prior to us. The team that was operating in another location for their entire rotation were potted up with the A&SF team that they handed over to us. So those guys were mounted, they drove to our location. They were there a couple days. We came in, they handed over all their equipment to us, and their SF team, their ANASF team to us.\n\nAnd that's who we ran with. Okay. And then the conventional units, you know, they obviously already existed at that point. They were just in different locations throughout WarDak province. And then they would move to us for whatever apps that they were coming with us on. Okay. So we didn't have to go through the like find recruit, like validate vet trend like that. And early phase zero phase one, you know, UW campaign style stuff. We didn't have to do those types of activities because we had a pot in the force already.\n\nHow long was the typical engagement last? Typical engagement, maybe an hour, an hour, maybe an hour. An hour. Maybe an hour. Yeah. Typical, some again, much shorter. Pop, pop, pop, we return fire. Everything goes quiet. We're good. Let's just move on.\n\nSome hours, where dudes are just digging in, and they're not stopping. More coordinated ambushes, coordinated attacks, usually reinforced with an ID or two or 10, those could go for multiple hours. But that's how we get the situation on control, get metavac and if need be, get to our F on station. Sometimes you could be a long night or a long day.\n\nYeah. Anything about this deployment that stands out in particular? Well, the way it ended, which was the result of not only me ultimately ended up losing my leg, but much more significantly our team leader was killed. Our infantry squad uplift, squad leader was killed. We had a squad of infantry guys that would there support us mostly for base defense stuff,\n\nbut we got to a point where we were bringing them out on some ops. Our dog was killed. This is at the tail end of the deployment. I was wounded twice in action before that, on two different times. The first time we only been in country a few weeks, you know, it took some shrapnel to the back of my shoulder. A couple of minutes\n\ntalking about that incident. Sure. What happened? Yeah, so we're driving to an objective. We get ambushed. Through four of us, dismount. We grab a handful of our Pada Force guys. We're in the maneuver element into a village. Probably an aggressive maneuver at that point. We were a real small element. And I believe that was the first time we'd ever actually stepped foot in that particular village.\n\nSo a lot of unknowns. And as we ended up having to clear our way all the way to this two-story compound where we were taking heavy machine gun fire from, IDFs kinda coming in, they're cracking off mortars. Grenades are going off around from us, from enemy to us. So this particular village ended up being one that we went back to multiple times over the course of that trip.\n\nI think this was the first time we'd actually entered into it. Realized quickly that we were in essentially a completely and totally Taliban- owned and run village Something exploded. We're getting ready to breach the entryway into a courtyard of this structure that we were trying to get to and Something had blown up behind me things are blowing up kind of all around. And I just feel the impact into the back of my shoulder.\n\nIt was like someone hit me with a baseball bat. And I look back and sure enough, there's like a lemon sized hole in the back of my shoulder. And it didn't really hurt. And lastly, what's like in shot, you know? So it didn't really hurt. The last, like, what's like in shot, you know? So it didn't really hurt, you know, adrenaline's pumping up, but it's like a shock to the system\n\nwhen you see a hole in your body, like that big. It's like, oh my god, like, am I okay? And then just kind of go into Medical training Training took over at that point one of my teammates got to me He bust out like some gods. He just like plugs it wraps it up real quick and I wanted to keep going my team sergeant was was with me on that element And I'm like I'm good let's roll. He's like now let's let's break contact, let's get back to the trucks and let's\n\nlike take a look at you. I was the first guy and I had to plan it to be wounded. So it was it was a shock to everybody. I leadership was like holy shit, someone's actually hurt for real. I certainly wasn't the last, but I was the first. So team sizes like, now I don't like this. Let's get out of here and let's like re-consolidate and see what's going on. And I remember throwing somewhat of a child this temper tantrum right there and then I'm like, no man, we just fought all the way to get to that door. They're still engaging the trucks from the structure. We're right outside the structure.\n\nShit. Like, let's go. And he's like, no, man, I don't like it. Probably the right call to make. Not because of my wound per se, but I think that we were over aggressive with where we were to begin with. And at that small of an element,\n\nexactly or down. Yeah. And it's very detrimental. Yeah, yeah. So in a lot of ways, I think this may have been a blessing that my team's sergeant was like, that's the that's the indicator that I think we need to wrap up and kind of reconfigure this thing. So, you know, get back to the trucks, mount up, my medics, one of my medics is back there, he takes a look at it, he's like, yeah, it's not that bad, you know, get back to the trucks, mount up my medics. One of my medics is back there, he takes a look at it.\n\nHe's like, yeah, it's not that bad, you'll be okay. And they're going back to the house. We aborted that mission, because we were on our way to an objective. So we can't get, went back to the house. Medic took a look at it, he's like, yeah, I wanna get you a med of act and get you in front of an actual doc.\n\nTake a look at this. And then I really threw a temper tantrum. My good child been toys or us that didn't get his toy. I mean, like kick an inch screaming. You have a lemon sized hole in the back of your shoulder. Yeah. And you throw in a temper tantrum. Yeah, man.\n\nSo we take a look at it. Yeah, I did not want to leave. I did not want to leave. I was really, really upset. Childishly upset. But I do what I was told, and then I look up the first time being a meta-vect, get to one of our forward surgical teams in FST.\n\nI was located somewhat close by. I took a look at it and they're like, okay, the way we treat this is we pack this thing with this antiseptic gauze two, three times a day so that it closes from the inside out. We can't just sew it shut because it's going to leave this cavity inside your body that will fastar and infection will happen. What did you get hit with?\n\nShrapnel. Shrapnel? Yeah. Grenade with my guess. Jesus. Yeah. And I mean, imagine if it was just, you know, because they hit right here, man, imagine if it was just a couple inches over, probably being game over. So the initial plan was to keep me at this location, which is where our AOB leadership is located. AOB leadership is like the company level leadership.\n\nSo your primary support element for the ODAs is where the AOB was at. And that's where this forward surgical team was located. And the docs are like, well, we're going to keep you here until this thing closes to make sure that you don't get an infection And I was like, okay, cool. I have to like three days, man. I really started to get Figuity and uncomfortable and you know, I'm in the talk and the guys are the guys are carrying on they're going on Ops and for the first time I'm watching some of this thing guys are carrying on, they're going on ops. And for the first time I'm watching some of this thing,\n\nsome of these things happen through ISI sensors, which was a weird perspective, just sitting in there and the jaw going, is this what we look like while we're out doing our thing? This is what we look like. I've never seen it before. And I'm just getting more frustrated day after day after day, maybe six, seven days goes by, and I've had enough.\n\nI'm at my breaking point, and I grabbed one of my buddies who's on the B team, and I said, bring me down to the, to the time act. The only way that we could get into for the team to get resupplied was was for rotary wing, or fixed wing, to come out of Bagram. That's where they all generated from. There were no flights that were coming out of\n\nwhere I was located, to back to where my camp was. So I needed to get to Bagram, at some point, to get back to the team. And after a week or so, I convinced one of my buddies to drive me down to the time act at that base. And I went from one C-130 to another. And I think on my third one, just talking to the crew, I'm like, I didn't know you guys going to Bogrum.\n\nAnd he's like, yeah, we're about to go to Bogrum right now. I'm like, can I come with you? And I'm like, sure. So I get on a plane, and I take off to, and I land at Bogrum. No one knows that I'm gone. Holy shit. Yeah. So I ended up at Bagram. And I'd only been at Bagram like once before. And I was just when we first got into country. And we were there like a day. And then we were flowing out to our actual site. So I really wasn't familiar with Bagram. I landed the airport. I'm like, I don pogrom. I landed the airport. I'm like, uh, I don't know what\n\nI'm doing here. I've me and my way over to the soft compound. And I walk into the jock. Now this is where the soda if is located. I got a battalion level command. I walk into the jock. And the soda command is like, what are you doing here? And I'm like, I need to find you to flight back to my team. And he's like kind of confused. And the sort of Sergeant Major, my battalion command Sergeant Major is right there.\n\nAnd he's like, they're both trying, I'm all trying to figure out what am I doing there? Like, how did I get there? And as I'm standing there, the phone rings. And remember, I just left where my company level command was there, the phone rings. And remember, I just left where my company level command was located, the phone rings, and Sergeant Major picks up the phone. And it's my company, Sergeant Major.\n\nAnd I can hear him screaming on the other end of the phone. And he's CSM's looking at me, kind of smiling. Yep, no, he's right here in front of me. And I'm like, oh yeah, okay, this definitely is about me. So I'm like, am I about to be like court-machial? I have no idea what's gonna happen, but I know him in trouble. This is about to suck, and CSM hands me the phone.\n\nHe's like, your Sajima agent wants to talk to you. I'm like, that's okay, get off my, hey, Sajima agent. He just comes completely unglued, you know, what the fuck are you doing here? What are you thinking? Yellowing and screaming. So Roger that, yes, Roger that, Sergeant Major, and nope, I know you're right.\n\nAnd then at the end of that, he's like, listen dude. I totally, I get it, man, like I get it. You wanna get back to your guys. Don't ever fucking do that again. I'm like, Roger that, so I hang up. CSM kind of thinks it's funny. Trying to be professional, but also kind of snicker. And I'm like, I need to ride back now.\n\nAnd the doc who had made the initial decision to keep me at that base until this healed up completely, he had entered the jock. And he's like, no, I told you, we're waiting until you're completely healed. And in that moment, right around that time, my team is out on an op and they get into an engagement. And now I'm watching it on a screen in the jock.\n\nAnd my team sergeant takes a round, which ended up being to his abdomen. So I'm watching this happen. These guys are reacting to contact. They're in a fight. Team Sajin takes a round, which ended up being to his abdomen. Shit. So I'm watching this happen. These guys are reacting to contact. They're in a fight. And now my team sajin's hit. And I come completely and totally unglued in the jockey in that moment, yelling, screaming, throwing chairs,\n\nlike a immature type of tantrum. And demanding that someone gets me a helicopter to get me back to the guys like now And the doc the doc dug in he's like no and then my commander was like hey Dude, I don't I don't know how you're gonna tell this guy know like good luck keeping him here So There's maybe a dare too later that they put me back on a bird. I was still dealing with the wound, but I knew it was relatively easy to treat. You know, my medics were more than capable of packing this thing twice a day themselves.\n\nSo, I didn't think there was a real risk to me, my health. And they saw it that way with a little convincing for me, just kind of flipping out. But I was back with the guys after that and then right back to work. Damn. So then it was just, you know, two or three times a day, they're packing this thing. We're going out on ops. You know, I'd bleed through the bandage, whatever. I just like, we just kind of managed it.\n\nIt really wasn't that big of a deal that went on for another couple of weeks and then it was closed up and then we were good. And then right around that time is when I was wounded for the second time. First time was in September. We infilled in September. This happened in September. And then in November was when I was wounded for the second time. Right around the time my shoulder had closed up, mostly anyway.\n\nI don't know if I'm taking an AK-47 round to the side of my face. Jesus. Yeah. And it sounds a lot worse than it is. So you hear someone say, like, I got shot in the face, you imagine, that if they're talking to you, like half their face would be, you know, removed. It just grazed my cheek. And the quick story is, we're coming back from an op. Let's do the long story. Okay.\n\nComing back from an op. "
