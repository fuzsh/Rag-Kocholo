Coming out of an artist's color shop in Regent Street early one morning I saw a young girl with a bright red shawl round her head like a gypsy, in a neat navy-blue frock, standing under the Arches rather shyly holding a little basket of flowers that she was evidently offering for sale. I was so struck by her extraordinary beauty that I turned back and asked her to let me paint her. She understood at once, and in the most charming manner said that she would. I had no card, but by good luck I had a letter from Wind sor Castle in my pocket giving my address in Whyte's studio, which I thought would impress her favorably. I gave it to her and asked her to bring it when she came to sit in the morning. She was, I thought, greatly relieved at my confidence and more sure than if I had given her a card. She came to the studio the next morning looking happy and contented at the thought that perhaps, after all, there was something less alarming in an artist's studio than being stared at by passers-by in Regent Street though fortunately she had not been there more than ten minutes when I spoke to her.\n\nWhyte was bowled over by her and, I admit, so was I. She told us that she was eighteen, that she had run away from a convent school, and that her name was Kathleen MacDermott. Her appearance and accent suggested that she was Irish. I learnt years afterwards that she was seven teen when I met her, and her real name was Annie Evans, for she had taken her mother's name to prevent discovery. I asked her if she would care to come to Scotland to be an artist's model. She jumped at the idea, and a day or two after, Whyte saw us off at Euston by the express train bound for Glasgow. I got her lodgings, but within a year she developed a cough I did not quite like. I called in a doctor, who said that her chest was weak and Glas gow not the place for her in winter. She reluctantly- agreed to go to her married sister in Wales both her parents were dead during the worst months in Glas gow. On January third, at the Central Station, we parted, she in tears, I, in my selfishness, with a sense of relief.\n\nAs the weeks passed I found it very difficult to resist her pleadings to come back to the studio; but for the doctor's warning me of the danger to her life I should have risked everything in my desire, even the royal pic ture. Fortunately for both of us the rush of sitters filled up my every moment, three and sometimes four a day com ing to the studio, broken at intervals by my having to go out to them. I had no assistance, no secretary or anyone to help me make and keep appointments scattered all over England, Ireland, Scotland, and Germany. Still the memory of that cold, bleak morning on the platform of the Central Station could not be blacked out. The more exhausted I became with overwork the weaker my re solve not to see her again. It was little wonder that the strain was beginning to show itself, and without my knowing it the doctor was told to keep an eye on me. All that I can remember was that for some reason I believed in my sleep that I was being blackmailed for something terrible I had done, the nature of which I can not remember. In the mornings I would leave my lodg ings for the studio, believing that I should find in the letter box a sealed document denouncing me. The sense of terror as I reached the door was indescribable, as was the relief when I found nothing of an incriminating na ture in my correspondence. As the day wore on and I got buried in my work I would gradually wake up to the fact that I had been dreaming and the whole thing was a night mare that persisted in holding me in its clutches even when I was awake.\n\nThis had been going on slowly but surely getting worse until one morning early in March I found Kathleen in the studio. There she was in white muslin, the cheap stiff kind that was all that she could afford, seated on the model's throne, a vision of innocent loveliness, waiting in fear that I might be angry and send her back. She said nothing. I was beaten. Joseph Crawhall and Patrick Whyte came in and acted as witnesses while I went through the formula, \"I, John Lavery, take you, Kath leen MacDermott, as my wedded wife,\" and so we were married. We were all sworn to secrecy until the comple tion of the royal picture. She was nineteen when Eileen was born, but she never recovered from it. Acute phthisis set in and within a year Kathleen passed away.\n\nWhyte, who had nursed her through all her illness, taking her from one health resort to another, had finally rented a furnished villa at Kilmalcolm near Glasgow, where I could go daily. There was a little sheltered garden where Kathleen, all wrapped up, would sit in the sun when there was any and where Whyte, day after day, week after week, sat with her. I could only spare the week ends. There was a United Presbyterian Kirk near that made the Sundays hideous by the harsh clang ing of a bell morning and evening. The days were short ening and growing too cold to sit out, and her cough was persistent. One Sunday morning the clanging bell was beginning. The nurse knocked at the door and said with characteristic Scottish brevity, \"She is going.\" I heard Whyte on the stair saying in a strained voice, \"Come quickly.\" She was being held up, breathing with diffi culty, her large eyes staring straight out. I took the nurse's place, but her eyes did not move, though her lips smiled. I tried to whisper a prayer in her ear. I could just hear \"Good-bye,\" a gasp, and her head fell forward. High up on the banks of the Clyde overlooking the Kyles of Bute she lies, under a simple headstone designed by Whyte.\"\n\nSources\n\nâ†‘ Page 12 of Life of a Painter by Sir John Lavery."
