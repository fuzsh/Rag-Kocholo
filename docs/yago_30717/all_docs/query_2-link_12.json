        "text": "For ATWT:\n\nFavorite Character (Male): This was a tough one but I'd definitely have to go with Dr. John Dixon as well simply for the fact the character was so versatile as both a good guy and a bad guy. Honorable mentions go to Hal Munson and Jack Snyder.\n\nLeast Favorite Character (Male): Hmm, I'd go with Noah Mayer for starters simply for being so spineless and boring.\n\nFavorite Character (Female): Another tough one, but if there was four women on the show I always absolutely loved to follow it would have Lucinda, Barbara, Carly, and Lisa. All four women weren't perfect, they were larger than life, they schemed and plotted away sometimes to the extremes yet I always found them root-able for the most part.\n\nLeast Favorite Character (Female): I think in long term overall ATWT's worst lead women was Katie Peretti. She was nothing but an unsympathetic sociopath who was always about her selfish self while she was a home-wrecker to multiple marriages (Holden and Lily, Mike and Jennifer, Jack and Carly etc.) I hated everytime she was onscreen and aside from her early story with Simon I usually hated all of the bubblehead's stories.\n\nFavorite Couple: John and Lucinda by far, followed by Hal and Barbara, Jack and Carly, and Bob and Kim.\n\nLeast Favorite Couple: Holden and Lily. Always thought Lily worked better with Damien and Dusty. Jack and Katie and Holden and Carly tie for second.\n\nFavorite Storyline: John vs. Lisa storyline there from 1995-1996 was great as two titans clashed and fought from the frivolous lawsuit brought on by Lisa to John's revenge to even the ridiculous moment of John saving the day for Lisa in Hong Kong. I'd also add the Doug Cummings story, a truly brilliant haunting mystery crafted by Marland.\n\nLeast Favorite Storyline: The Jessica/Doc Reese/Margo fiasco was humiliating and almost made me sick of ATWT because it was so dreadful. The Z Twins was pretty bad too. So was the Paul/Rosanna/Craig/Meg quad.\n\nFavorite Scene: \"Hello Barbara......\"\n\nLeast Favorite Scene: Julia's rape of Jack is pretty self-explanatory I see.\n\nFunniest Scene: Susan and Kim arguing over Alison's involvement with Chris; Susan: \"Say hi to Bob for me\" Kim: \"GO TO HELL!!!\"\n\nBest Recast: Cady McClain as Rosanna. She truly turned this character in a 180.\n\nWorst Recast: Shawn Batten as Connor and Christina Chambers as Molly. Both failed epicly.\n\nWhat epitomized As the World Turns: The ensemble. The community. The multi-generational set-up even though it was improperly used. The family. The town of Oakdale itself. Oh and of course, Nancy's coffee.\n\nFavorite male character:\n\nToss up between Bob Hughes and John Dixon, which is funny as they are character foils. John (like my Roger Thorpe ) was that quintessential bad boy that constantly did wrong, but really didn't mean too. Bob, on the other hand, was the loveable father figure that I so wish I had.\n\nFavorite female character:\n\nThis is SO hard as I loved majority of the female characters on this soap (unlike many other soaps). Carly being a screw up, Lily being a loveable shrew, Lisa being meddlesome, Kim being loveable yet stern, Nancy just being Nancy, Barbara and her cattiness, Margo, Lucinda, and Jessica being strong, professional women. . . *sighs* I miss my ladies of Oakdale.\n\nLeast favorite male character:\n\nMajority of Jean Passantate's male character creations. But I'll be diplomatic and choose Jon Lindstrom's Craig. He was not Craig for me, and he looked grossed paired with Maura West or Cady McClain (sorry Cady). Plus, I was still p*ssed because I was glad to have Scott Bryce back in a role he originated, and I finally got to see the Craig that everyone raved about. I grew to love Bryce and was so p*ssed when Goutman got rid of him.\n\nLeast favorite female character:\n\nSophie Duran. Such a stupid character. I hated her when they tried to peg her as the victim, and I hated her when she became unhinged. I was so glad when she got the boot.\n\nFavorite couple:\n\nBob and Kim. Reading a lot of their history, seeing what I did see growing up in the 90s till the end of the series, YouTube, and SoapClassics--this pairing was everything. Bob and Kim (along with Tom and Margo) displayed that soap couples can stay married, have obstacles, and still drive story with a capable writer penning the story.\n\nLeast favorite couple:\n\nJack and Janet. I SO hated this pairing because I knew that JP was doing this because she was eager to cram a crap character down our throats, and what better way to attempt to do so than pairing him with one of the show's leading men.\n\nFavorite story:\n\nIt was a bit before my time but (again) thanks to YouTube and Soaps Classic, the Doug Cumming story is endearing. I am hooked with how Marland devised this story, ingeniously using Kim's history to tell it.\n\nLeast favorite story:\n\nEmily's egg baby, Hunter. That story (and character) was so stupid and pointless. I hated how he was paired with my Maddie, thus preventing her from reuniting with Casey. I hated that Larry would just steal and use Emily's egg to do so. . . Ugh. That story was just dreadful.\n\nOther stories would be the Z Twins and Noah having to marry that mess named Amira.\n\nFunniest scene:\n\nA scene involving Molly, Barbara, and Carly in Fashions. Carly was buying stuff from the store, much to the chagrin of Barbara, and the casheir said something slick to Barbara after Carly and Molly left, and she told her to shove it. Barbara diving out the court window is hilarious too.\n\nFavorite scene:\n\nThe final scene of the show. To me, it meant so much. This was a show that I watched with my Grandmother, and sadly, she passed five months before the finale. Helen Wagner (too) passed before the finale, so their was so much tied to that final scene. When Bob uttered \"Goodnight,\" the lights dimmed, the globe lit up and started to spin, and the Prince of Tides theme (Reunion) started to play, I cried like I've never cried before (which I am doing now as I write this ).\n\nBob Hughes and I were connected as Nancy Hughes and my grandmother were. My grandma heard Nancy say \"Good morning,\" and I, another generation, heard Bob finish the show off, as I (too) finished a show that was a legacy in my family. I had my epiphany (as I didn't cry when my grandma passed or at the funeral) and finally learned to let go of my grandmother and this show. I still have moments where I miss both but I realize that both my grandma and ATWT lives in me.\n\nAnother scene is when Katie was exposed at the award ceremony when she was working for WOAK. That scene was SO good. Maybe because I am a Carjack fan, it has to be when Jack thought Carly was dying of a brain tumor (around the time he was about to marry that heffa, Katie). Their last break up scenes were good too. Oh and Katie saying goodbye to Brad was one of my faves too.\n\nLeast favorite scene:\n\nThose scenes with Roseanna working in that Garden store/market (one of her last returns) -- painful if anything. The shaky cams were annoying and Roseanna working in a market was the stupid crap EVER. She's a freaking heiress!\n\nBest recast:\n\nBilly Magnussen as Billy -- I liked him and it was hard to replace someone so popular as Zack Roerig.\n\nWorst recast:\n\nJon Lindstrom as Craig Montgomery\n\nValentina De Angelis as Faith Snyder\n\nSarah Wilson as Liberty Ciccone\n\nWhat ATWT epitomized for me:\n\nThe Hughes. It was something about that family that drew me to them. Their dynamic, their struggles, their joys, their love for each other, their foundation, Nancy, who reminded me so much of my own (maternal) grandmother. So sad when both left this world in 2010. But I (too) loved the community, their other families and their dynamics, the history that spanned for 53 years. Besides Guiding Light and Another World, NO other soap has touched me like World Turns have.\n\nFavorite Male Character: Hal Munson Ben Hendrickson took a secondary role and made him the moral compass of the show.\n\nFavorite Female Character: Carly Tenney Love a character you can love and loath at the same time!\n\nLeast Favorite Male Character: Jon Lindstrom's Craig Montgomery. Scott Bryce was perfection as Craig. Hunt Block was a one-note joke as Craig, but at least he was entertaining. Lindstroms Craig was two things Craig never was : inconsequential and boring.\n\nLeast Favorite Female: Janet Ciccone. The beginning of the end of the show.\n\nFavorite Couple: Katie and Simon. Katie usually was toxic with any man she was paired with, but it was different with Simon. Does anyone remember their parting scene at the fence? I didnt know they could be that good!\n\nLeast Favorite Couple: Paul and Rosanna. Cady was too good an actress to be paired with One-=Exp ression Roger.\n\nFavorite Storyline: Lisas malpractice suit against John, and his subsequent revenge. I've never cared for Eileen Fulton as an actress, but in this storyline, she was magnificent.\n\nFunniest Scene: (Tie) 1) Barbara is cornered in the ladys room by Shannon O'Hara , who dunks her head in a toilet. Lyla walks into a drenched Babs, and drily say Whats wrong, Barbara, you look flushed?\". 2) Emma and Carly have a nasty fight, which Carly ends by telling Mama Snyder that her celebrated mashed potatoes were always lumpy. The shocked look on Kathleen Widdoes face was priceless.\n\nFavorite Scene: Barbara and Hals engagement party , where Parkers paternity is revealed.\n\nLeast Favorite Scene: Mike Kasnoff is told that ex-wife Jennifer is dead, so he promptly proclaims his love for Katie. I wanted to puke.\n\nBest Recast: Hillary B Smith as Margo. I never thought Id like anyone who replaced Margaret Colin, but she won me over.\n\nWorst Recast: Where do I begin? Jon Lindstrom as Craig, John Howard as Paul Ryan, Randy Mantooth as Hal, Glynis O'Connor as Margo, Jon \"I Was A Teenage Mike Kasnoff\" Prescott, that awful Maddie Coleman recast,the Orlena Grimaldi recast who defined over-the-top scenery chewing, etc. But nothing was as bad as the Connor Walsh recast. Epic.\n\nWhat epitomized ATWT for me? The acting. Storylines may be terrible (the shrunken head, the Z Twins, the Carolyn Crawford mystery), but the acting was so far above what was on other soaps, that it was like day and night.\n\nGonna play catch-up. Unfortunately, I was never a true daily watcher of either soap, but that said, I've got a pretty good knowledge and always kept up with them and know most of their overall histories but I'll try and stick to what I've seen.\n\nALL MY CHILDREN:\n\nFavorite male character\n\nAdam Chandler. Hands down. David Canary is absolutely fantastic. He stole the show the entire last week, IMO, and his exit was much more of a huge blow to AMC than I realized initially.\n\nRUNNER UP: Stuart & David. I was torn between those three.\n\nLeast favorite male character\n\nRyan Lavery. I like Cam Mathison, I do (though not really as an actor, LOL) but Ryan was a complete waste of a character. At least in the beginning of his run he had goals and ambition and there were character traits. It was lost on his return. Greenlee also suffered from this big time. Both characters were just ultimately stuck in this rut they never got out of. Relationship roulette on soaps is KILLING a lot of characters.\n\nRunner Up: Zach. Ugh. At times. I just thought they treated the character as this second coming instead of what he could have been.\n\nFavorite female character\n\nAngie. I love Debbi Morgan. She grabbed me every single time no matter what she was doing. Angie's strength, love, insecurity/confidence, etc. Just a great character who quickly, IMO, became a very vital part of the show, especially in it's last few years.\n\nRunner(s) Up: Erica, Brooke and Annie\n\nLeast favorite female character\n\nCan't really think of any.\n\nFavorite couple\n\nErica and Brooke. I really don't have any of the past popular couples to really make a judgement on so I'm going with them. LOL.\n\nLeast favorite couple\n\nJR and Babe. I think Babe completely dragged JR down. I think the writers wanted to recapture the Tad/Dixie type of romance. I think Babe's \"sainthood\" status killed anything I might have liked about them.\n\nFavorite story\n\nCambias drama. It honestly really made me take notice of AMC and I watched regularly for quite a while after that.\n\nLeast favorite story\n\nThe unabortion. I feel like the show jumped the shark at that point and to me, wasn't the same, especially knowing the history of the show. Also, Julia's unecessary death and Stuart's murder just caused me to really become less interested in watching at the time.\n\nFunniest scene\n\nI'm so bad with remembering ANYTHING. LOL. I swear I am terrible.\n\nFavorite scene\n\nStuart and Marian's reunion. IDK why but when I think of AMC right now, that just comes to mind. I should put them as favorite couple ... like Carl, I loved them.\n\nLeast Favorite Scene\n\nAgain, meh. IDK.\n\nBest recast\n\nJacob Young as JR\n\nWorst recast\n\nAndrew Ridings as JR (my god he was atrocious beyond belief)\n\nAnd what epitomized AMC to you?\n\nThe 'quaint' feeling the show had. The heart. The comedy. The off-beat, 'different' characters. The real, human drama mixed with some campy, 'out-there' moments as only AMC could do. I think the show just had 'it' for the most part. Strong actors and strong writing. I mean, the history alone makes me wish I could see this show from the start. I just personally love everything about it.\n\nAS THE WORLD TURNS\n\nFavorite male character\n\nJohn. Yeah, I didn't really see him in his heyday but I love him. His exit burned me a little bit at the time and I lost a lot of interest in ATWT.\n\nI imagine if I had more years of Hal and Ben Hendrickson, he'd probably be tied to John. I liked what I saw. He had such a natural presence and the show lost a lot without Hal and John.\n\nLeast favorite male character\n\nPaul Ryan <- Roger Howarth's version. Though I absolutely despised Dusty. I'd say it's tied for me.\n\nFavorite female character\n\nSusan Stewart <- Marie Masters was fantastic. I kind of agree, yet again AMS. I wish she had been given more to do. Susan was always just so fascinating to me.\n\nBarbara would be a very close second. VERY close. Probably tied. LOL\n\nLeast favorite female character\n\nKatie. I couldn't stand her for some reason after her downfall was what got me into ATWT.\n\nFavorite couple\n\nBob & Kim Hughes <- yup. I could watch them both just read the phonebook or sit there and not even speak. Something about Kathryn Hays and Don Hastings I just adore. I miss seeing them, honestly. Same for all the vets of ATWT. They had fantastic vets who were SO misued for at least a decade, IMO, they were ALL so capable of leading storyline, even still. Vital veterans and they just ignored them. With SUCH history. So shameful.\n\nLeast favorite couple\n\nPaul Ryan & Meg Snyder <- agreed. Yuck.\n\nFavorite story\n\nKatie's downfall. It got me into ATWT, honestly and I was pissed she became a dizzy little heroine who grew to be really annoying.\n\nLeast favorite story\n\nCarly/Jack/Janet triangle <- agreed. ugh.\n\nFunniest scene\n\nFavorite scene\n\nLeast favorite scene.\n\nBest recast\n\nScott Holroyd as Paul\n\nWorst recast\n\nDavida Williams as Jade Taylor (yeah, I agree with AMS)\n\nAnd what epitomized ATWT to you\n\nQuintessential soap opera. Slow-moving, lots and lots of talking. Older characters having coffee. Riveting drama derived primarily from domestic situations. Watching ATWT on a good day would put me in an extremely happy place, where a soap was truly a soap. <- STOLE THIS FROM AMS. I completely agree."
