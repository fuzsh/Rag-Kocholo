RYass, who has repeatedly said that since Kendall confessed, she must be guilty? RYass, who even told his precious daughter that Kendall is in prison because she did all those bad things? UGH!\n\nYou took the words right out of my mouth, searose! (And used some of my personal favorite smileys, too!) Of COURSE Ryass gets to solve the mystery, after Zach has done all the legwork, taken all the risks, and run himself ragged hiding Kendall.\n\nIn a world so full of doubt and uncertainty ~ isn't it reassuring to know that some things never change?\n\nThis never changes either. From me to TPTB:\n\nQuote:\n\nOriginally Posted by searose\n\nI hope when this is all over, they will give us some kind of explanation (like, \"the toomah made me do it\" or a brain damage from the second head injury??? ) that makes Kendall call Liza\n\nAt this point, after watching Kendall behaving like a jealous tantrum-throwing toddler for months on end, is it really necessary for them to come up with an explanation for Kendall calling Liza? This is what Kendall's been building up to all this time -- Zach won't perform in bed for her, which means in Kendall's tiny paranoid mind that he must be doing Liza, so Kendall will just fuck Zach in her own inimitable way instead. Fuck him without kissing him.\n\n__________________"
