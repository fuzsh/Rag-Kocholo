        "text": "South African actor Esta TerBlanche, who starred on the beloved soap “All My Children” for years, has died, her publicist and manager said.\n\nShe was 51.\n\nLisa Rodrigo, TerBlanche’s publicist, shared the news on Facebook, writing that “it’s with a heavy heart that my friend and client Esta TerBlanche passed away Thursday of natural causes. An autopsy report is pending.”\n\n“I am still processing and in shock. Esta was a beautiful soul in and out. I was proud to know her and work with her. More to come in the days ahead,” she wrote. “May she RIP with the angels that she is.”\n\nTerBlanche died in a residence in Los Angeles, according to online medical examiner’s records. No details about the cause or manner were listed.\n\nHer manager, Annie Spoliansky, said Monday: \"Esta was such a kind, loving, giving, and caring person.\"\n\n\"She cared so deeply for all people and animals. She had squirrels she fed and looked after daily, her two cats and recent kittens that she cared for as her own children,\" she said. \"Esta was never anything but generous and lovely to me, and I’m grateful to have known her for the time that I did, and devastated to learn of her passing.\"\n\nSpoliansky had written on social media Sunday: “Deeply saddened to hear of the passing of my dear friend and client Esta TerBlanche. She was a beautiful and gentle soul who will be incredibly missed. Her long running role on All my children will live on.”\n\nTerBlanche was born Jan. 7, 1973, in Rustenburg in the North West province of South Africa. She won Miss Teen South Africa in 1991 as a young beauty before she entered the acting world, Deadline reported.\n\nShe starred in “All My Children” as the Hungarian princess Gillian Andrassy Lavery from 1997 to 2001. She also starred in the TV series \"Egoli: Place of Gold\" from 1992 to 1995, according to her IMDb profile.\n\nCameron Mathison, who played TerBlanche’s character’s love interest, Ryan Lavery, on “All My Children,” paid tribute to her Sunday.\n\nOn his Instagram stories he shared a photo of the two of them from the show with the caption, “RIP my sweet princess.” He also shared a photo of the two of them smiling off-set, writing: “Esta helped me last year when Red was sick and paralyzed and I was struggling. One of the sweetest people ever.”\n\nDeadline reported TerBlanche was splitting her time between Los Angeles and South Africa when she died."
