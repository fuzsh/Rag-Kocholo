        "text": "Phil Donahue\n\nPhil Donahue, the legendary daytime talk show host, died on Aug. 18 at 88. Renowned as the “King of Daytime Talk,” Donahue was a TV trailblazer due to his influential work on his issue-oriented program, The Phil Donahue Show from 1967 to 1996. Unlike other talk shows of the era, Donahue’s eponymous show focused on one guest or topic at a time, for its entire hour, while inviting the audience to ask questions. For his debut episode, Donahue hosted atheist activist Madalyn Murray O’Hair, who had worked to throw prayer out of public schools — a controversial choice that made for revolutionary TV. From there, Donahue didn’t shy away from sensationalist or sensitive issues, often tackling those that other daytime TV shows wouldn’t dare to touch, including incest, abortion, and homosexuality. Across his 29-year tenure, Donahue interviewed feminists, Ku Klux Klan members, heads of state, politicians, porn stars, and more. The show attracted a largely female audience, and was held in high esteem for highlighting women’s issues. While chatting with Oprah for O magazine in 2002, Donahue said, “The show became a place where women discussed issues that didn't naturally come up, and certainly not in mixed company. Much of what we talked about on the air is what women had been talking about in ladies' rooms.” He earned nine Daytime Emmys and 21 nominations as well as a primetime Emmy for his special Donahue and Kids. Donahue also received a Peabody Award in 1981.\n\nJohn Aprea\n\nJohn Aprea, who portrayed a young Salvatore Tessio in The Godfather Part II and the father of John Stamos’ Jesse Katsopolis in Full House, died on Aug. 5. He was 83. Born to Italian immigrants in Englewood, N.J., in 1941, Aprea made his film debut as Killer in the 1968 action pic, Bullitt, which also starred Steve McQueen. He would next appear in The Grasshopper and The Dark Side of Tomorrow, and around the same time, auditioned for the role of Michael Corleone in Francis Ford Coppola’s The Godfather. The role went to Al Pacino, who played the part in the 1972 film and its sequels, but Aprea eventually joined the critically acclaimed trilogy for The Godfather Part II as a younger version of Tessio, the mobster originally portrayed by Abe Vigoda. Aprea considered the highly-regarded film, which won six Oscars and became the first sequel to win Best Picture, a “monumental” role for him. He went on to lead the short-lived NBC sitcom, The Montefuscos, and had dual roles in Another World. Aprea also appeared in Falcon Crest, The Sopranos, Days of Our Lives, the telenovela American Heiress, and the acclaimed NBC miniseries The Gangster Chronicles. On the big screen, Aprea found further success in films including Caged Heat, The Manchurian Candidate, The Stepford Wives, David Fincher’s The Game, and more.\n\nMaurice Williams\n\nMaurice Williams, the frontman of the doo-wop group the Zodiacs and singer-songwriter behind their 1960 hit song “Stay,” died on Aug. 6 at 86. Born April 26, 1938, in Lancaster, S.C., Williams began performing in church at the age of six and formed his first group, The Royal Charms, during his high school years. That group went through several names and reformed before becoming Maurice Williams and the Zodiacs. They achieved their first hit in 1957, with \"Little Darlin,” but it was their 1960 track \"Stay\" that cemented them in music history. The song topped the Billboard Hot 100, becoming the shortest song to ever do so at just one minute and 32 seconds. It later featured in the 1987 classic Dirty Dancing, starring Patrick Swayze and Jennifer Grey and was frequently covered by such artists as The Hollies and the Four Seasons, Jackson Browne, Bruce Springsteen, and Tom Petty. Following their massive success with “Stay,” the group also enjoyed success with their 1961 hit “May I,” and they continued touring and recorded music through 2000. Williams is survived by his wife, Emily.\n\nAlain Delon\n\nAlain Delon, the smoldering French leading man of the 1960s and ’70s known for such hits as René Clément’s Purple Noon and Jean-Pierre Melville’s Le Samouraï, has died at 88, his family told French news agency, AFP. Born on Nov. 8, 1935, in Sceaux, France, Delon earned a vocational degree as a teenager, worked in a butcher shop, and served in the French Navy before landing his first feature in the 1957 revenge thriller Send a Woman When the Devil Fails at 22. He worked steadily from there, with 1960’s Purple Noon — an adaptation of Patricia Highsmith’s The Talented Mr. Ripley — marking his breakthrough. The film was a critically acclaimed box office success, with some reviewers dubbing Delon “the new James Dean.” His additional credits include L’Eclisse, Histoires Extraordinaires, La Piscine, Borsalino, Nouvelle Vague, The Yellow Rolls-Royce, Once a Thief, Texas Across the River, and Lost Command. He was controversially awarded an honorary Palme d’Or at Cannes in 2019, despite a petition that protested his “racism, homophobia and misogyny” garnering more than 25,000 signatures. At the event, he bid farewell to his cinematic career, saying, \"It's a bit of a posthumous tribute, but from my lifetime. I am going to leave, but I won't leave without thanking you.\" Delon is survived by his son, Anthony, from his marriage to actress Nathalie Barthélémy and by children, Alain-Fabien and Anouchka, from his relationship with Rosalie van Breemen.\n\nAfa Anoa'i\n\nWWE wrestler Afa Anoa'i, who competed with his late brother, Sika Anoa'i, as the tag team Wild Samoans in the '70s and '80s, died Aug. 16 at 81. His daughter Vale announced the news on social media, just two months after Sika's death. \"Today, all of our lives are irreparably changed,\" she wrote. \"I love you so much, Dad. More than any words could ever express. Your strength was absolutely superhuman. You fought all the way to the end, and the end was peaceful.\" She noted that he had suffered two heart attacks in January, among other health issues, and had been in hospice care. In his wrestling days, Anoa'i was a force. He and his brother won the World Tag Team Championship three times and were inducted into the WWE Hall of Fame in 2007. Later, Anoa'i contributed to the WWE by managing his son and nephew, then by training future wrestlers. The WWE lamented his loss, remembering his tag team as \"one of the most feared\" in WWE history. Among his survivors is wrestler Roman Reigns, Sika's son.\n\nPeter Marshall\n\nPeter Marshall, the original host of Hollywood Squares and a prolific actor on series like CHiPs and The Love Boat, died on Aug. 15 at 98. Marshall's death was announced via a post on his official website, which noted, \"According to his wife of 35 years, Laurie, Peter passed at home, surrounded by loved ones.\" Marshall followed his sister, the actress Joanne Dru (Red River) to New York City in the late 1940s where he worked as an NBC page, took his comedy act to The Ed Sullivan Show, and won starring roles in theatrical productions like Bye Bye Birdie. Marshall was asked to host the inaugural edition of Hollywood Squares in 1966, and presided over the series as it made stars out of the likes of Paul Lynde, Joan Rivers, and Charo until 1981. Marshall also made a memorable appearance as the radio jockey Bert Healey in 1982's Annie. Marshall is survived by his wife Laurie, daughters Suzanne Browning and Jaime Dimarco, son Pete LaCock, twelve grandchildren, and eight great-grandchildren.\n\nJack Russell\n\nJack Russell, a founding member of the hair rock band Great White, who rose to fame in the '80s with their biggest hit, \"Once Bitten Twice Shy,\" died Aug. 15. He was 63. The frontman's family announced his death on social media, a month after Russell shared that he had been diagnosed with Lewy body dementia and multiple system atrophy. Though band members parted ways in 2001, Russell continued to perform under the name Jack Russell's Great White, prompting a legal battle. This iteration of the group was moments into a performance at the Station nightclub in West Warwick, R.I., in 2003, when their pyrotechnics sparked a fire. When it was over, 100 people had died, including guitarist Ty Longley, and 230 people had been injured. While Russell was not charged in the deaths, the band paid victims $1 million. At the same time he announced the news about his health, Russell had said he was retiring from touring. \"Words cannot express my gratitude for the many years of memories, love, and support,\" he wrote. \"Thank you for letting me live my dreams.\"\n\nGreg Kihn\n\nGreg Kihn, the rock singer-songwriter who scored big with his early MTV-era hits “The Breakup Song (They Don’t Write ‘Em)” and “Jeopardy,” died on on Aug. 13 of complications from Alzheimer's. He was 75. Born Gregory Stanley Kihn in Baltimore on July 10, 1949, Kihn initially began his career in his hometown, playing music of the folksy singer-songwriter variety before relocating to San Francisco in the early ‘70s. There, he would gain acclaim for his unique blend of folk, classic rock, blues, and melodic pop that would heavily influence the Bay Area music scene of the ‘80s. By 1976, Kihn formed the Greg Kihn Band alongside guitarist Robbie Dunbar, bassist Steve Wright, and drummer Larry Lynch. The group released several albums together, scoring their first hit with “The Breakup Song (They Don’t Write ‘Em),” which got to No. 15 on the Hot 100 in May 1981. The group reached new heights with the release of their 1983 track “Jeopardy,” which became an MTV favorite, hit No. 2 on the Hot 100, and inspired the parody song from \"Weird Al\" Yankovic, “I Lost on Jeopardy.” Kihn also published several horror novels and served as a morning radio host on the San Jose, Calif.–based station KUFX-FM (KFOX) for nearly two decades.\n\nKevin Sullivan\n\nKevin Sullivan, the wrestling icon who performed as the Taskmaster and worked extensively behind the scenes for WCW, died at Aug. 9 at age 74. A cause of death was not immediately released; however, Sullivan was involved in a “devastating accident” in Florida on May 12, and he was diagnosed with sepsis and encephalitis after undergoing emergency surgery. As a wrestler with WCW, Sullivan teamed with Cactus Jack to win a Tag Team Title before he formed the Three Faces of Fear with Avalanche and the Butcher to feud with Hulk Hogan, Sting, and Randy Savage. After that, Sullivan became the Taskmaster and formed the Dungeon of Doom, who faced off against Hogan’s Hulkamaniacs during WarGames and feuded with the Four Horsemen. At the end of his wrestling career, he feuded extensively with Chris Benoit, ultimately losing a retirement match to him in 1997. Sullivan spent the rest of his career as a booker, and made occasional appearances for independent promotions. His podcast Taskmaster Talks has run since 2020.\n\nMitzi McCall\n\nMitzi McCall, the comedian and actress who famously shared the Ed Sullivan Show stage with the Beatles and indelibly played a dry cleaner's wife with boundary issues on Seinfeld, died Aug. 8, at 93. McCall formed a comedy duo with her husband, Charlie Brill, who appeared on The Ed Sullivan Show on the night that the Fab Four first performed on an American stage. Her best-remembered acting role came in the 1994 Seinfeld episode \"The Secretary,\" wherein Jerry (Jerry Seinfeld) accosts her character, a dry-cleaner's wife, for wearing his mother's fur coat. In addition to recurring roles on Silk Stalkings, Alright Already, and Life Goes On, McCall appeared in episodes of shows like The Twilight Zone, The Tonight Show, Scooby-Doo, Roseanne, Ellen, Becker, Chuck, Hannah Montana, and The Suite Life of Zack & Cody.\n\nConnie Chiume\n\nConnie Chiume, the trailblazing South African actress who broke through apartheid barriers and starred in both Black Panther films, died on Aug. 6 at 72.

But by then Chiume was already in the fourth decade of her acting career, which followed a full tenure as a teacher in Johannesburg. She rose to fame in 1989 on the popular TV series Ikolm' Edwa Yadwa. As apartheid was dismantled around her, Chiume's star grew, leading her to award-winning roles in series like Soul City and Home Affairs, and films like In My Country, co-starring Samuel L.

Newhart's first comedy album, The Button-Down Mind of Bob Newhart, won the Grammy for Album of the Year in 1961, while Newhart was named Best New Artist. His work in stand-up got him noticed by NBC, which gave him a variety show in 1961. The program only lasted one season, but it showed Hollywood he had the chops for hosting — and for busting chops.

Newhart would go on to lead the eponymous sitcoms The Bob Newhart Show and Newhart, the latter of which was known for its iconic ending.\n\nCheng Pei-pei\n\nCheng Pei-pei, the Chinese actress known for her roles in Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon and Come Drink with Me, died July 17.
