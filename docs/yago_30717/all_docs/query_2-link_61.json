        "text": "Welcome, Cameron Mathison!\n\nThe former soap opera star, best known for his role as Ryan Lavery on All My Children, is joining the Entertainment Tonight team as a full-time correspondent and weekend co-anchor. He comes to us with an already impressive resume, having served as a correspondent for Good Morning America, competing on season five of Dancing with the Stars, and hosting renovation reality show Game of Homes.\n\nVIDEO: Cameron Mathison Looks Back on His Steamy 'All My Children' Sex Scenes\n\nBefore checking out his big debut on tonight's show, here are nine things you need to know about him!\n\n1. He's a Fun-Loving Guy\n\n\"Three words that people use to describe me: energetic, positive and upbeat,\" Mathison tells ET.\n\n2. He’s a Former Sandwich Artist\n\n\"I worked in a submarine sandwich shop,\" the All My Children star says of his first job. \"What I remember mostly about working there is answering the phone, because it just sounded so ridiculous. It was named Boudles, and they would go, 'Boudles Subs, Soups, and Salads, can I help you?'\"\n\n3. He’s a Directioner\n\n\"Lots of One Direction on my playlists,\" Mathison admits, when asked what people would be surprised to find on his iPod. \"Partially because my daughter likes it. That’s the excuse that I use.\"\n\nBut his love for the boy band clearly runs deep, as he admits, \"I was legitimately disappointed when Zayn departed.\"\n\nVIDEO: Stars Give Us Their Best 'Dramatic Soap Face' At the Daytime Emmys\n\n4. He's Already Making Good With His New ET Co-Hosts\n\nWho would Mathison want to play him in a Lifetime biopic?\n\n\"Kevin Frazier,\" the former soap star says without hesitation.\n\n5. He's a Healthy Eater, Until He's Not\n\n\"I have lots of guilty pleasures,\" Mathison confesses. \"Dark chocolate with peanut butter, chocolate chip cookies. Because I watch what I eat so carefully, when I’m ready to go, I go deep.\"\n\n6. He’d Love to Party With Led Zeppelin\n\nWhen asked what celebrity, living or dead, he’d like to have a drink with, Mathison tells ET, \"I would probably choose to have a drink with Jimmy Page, back in the day, in like 1975, [when] he’s the lead guitarist of Led Zeppelin. He was a legendary player, but also a legendary partier.\"\n\nNEWS: Former ET Correspondent Leeza Gibbons Wins 'Celebrity Apprentice'\n\n7. He Likes Cartoons\n\n\"I don’t know what this says about me,\" Mathison says of his favorite TV show. \"But it’s probably The Simpsons.\"\n\n8. He's a Family Man\n\n\"My parents have been my greatest influence for sure,\" Mathison tells ET. \"They’ve shown unbelievable work ethic, they’ve shown how important it is to be a good person inside and out, and I think that just sort of pervades everything.\"\n\n9. He’s All About Kindness\n\n\"The most valuable lesson that I have ever learned is no matter what, go with kindness,\" says Mathison. \"No matter what, think about others, try to be kind. That’s the most valuable lesson.\"\n\nDon't miss his sit down with Jon Cryer on tonight's show!\n\nWATCH: Meet 'ET's Newest Correspondent Nischelle Turner\n\nCheck out when ET welcomed correspondent Nischelle Turner back in October in the video below!"
