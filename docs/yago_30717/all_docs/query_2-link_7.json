        "text": "Their marriage is no more.\n\n“General Hospital” star Cameron Mathison, 54, and his wife, Vanessa, 57, are splitting after 22 years of marriage.\n\nMathison, who is also a Hallmark and Great American Family star, and his wife released a joint statement via Instagram on Wednesday.\n\n“After 22 years of marriage, we have made the difficult decision to part ways. We enter this new chapter with deep love, kindness, and respect for each other,” they wrote.\n\n“We hold gratitude in our hearts for the wonderful years we shared together. Our children have been and will continue to be our highest priority, and we will forever share in our devotion and love for them.”\n\nCameron and Vanessa have son Lucas, 21, and daughter Leila, 18.\n\nThe former couple first met in 1998 when they were models working in New York City. They got married in 2002 after three years of dating.\n\nCameron is best known for playing Ryan Lavery in “All My Children” from 1998-2011, and since 2021, he’s played Drew Cain on “General Hospital.” Vanessa also guest-starred on the latter.\n\nHe’s also been a host for “Entertainment Tonight,” on Season 5 of “Dancing With the Stars,” a correspondent for “Good Morning America” and he’s been in several TV films for both Hallmark and Great American Family, such as “Very, Very, Valentine” and “A Kindhearted Christmas.”\n\nIn 2019, Cameron was diagnosed with renal cell carcinoma and went into remission.\n\nIn 2022, Cameron told ET about his marriage: “It hasn’t all been smooth, for sure. We went through rocky times the first five years. Getting through those times, and getting to call Vanessa my best friend and fully enjoy every moment together, it’s been better than I could have ever imagined marriage being for me.”\n\nIn June, during an appearance on Cheryl Burke’s “Sex, Lies, and Spray Tans” podcast, Cameron recalled being worried about working with pro Edyta Śliwińska on “DWTS” in 2007.\n\n“I called [the casting director] and I said, ‘Listen, I’m so happy that you’ve offered me the show. I can’t wait. I’m in. Just do me a favor. Put me with anybody but Edyta,'” he recalled.\n\n“Because I knew my wife and I, we were going through a little bit of a challenge at that time,” he said.\n\nThe two were ultimately partnered together and came in fifth place.\n\nCameron remarked that Śliwińska “didn’t wear a lot of clothes,” but they ended up dancing together and becoming “close.”\n\n“Vanessa was a trooper,” he said on the podcast. “We’d sort of recently gone through a bunch of stuff, and it wasn’t great timing and I was off in LA spending time with this beautiful woman dressed up, against her, sweating with her five hours a day rehearsing, and then doing all the press and touring stuff together, and it was really hard.”\n\nHe added: “I tried. I did everything in my power to make that as easy for her as possible, but it just is what it is. I mean, you can be married and do the show, obviously, but it can be — depending on the circumstances — it’s just really hard.”\n\nIn May, Cameron told People magazine that he had “plans” after officially becoming an empty-nester and sending his daughter off to college.\n\n“I think that I have a lot of passions. I have a lot of hobbies … What I don’t want to do is just sort of have that time wasted,” he told the outlet. “But I feel I have some plans.”\n\nThe former couple’s statement announcing their divorce ended by noting, “We remain friends, and both wish the best for one another. We sincerely appreciate your respect for our family’s privacy during this transition.”"
