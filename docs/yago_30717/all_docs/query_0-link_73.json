So why question him when he told her he wanted to go to a sperm bank to conceive, claiming he had genetic disabilities in his family? Annie was artificially inseminated and nine months later gave birth to her daughter, Emma. As Emma aged, Annie discovered that Terry was a sexual predator that had seduced many teenaged girls.
