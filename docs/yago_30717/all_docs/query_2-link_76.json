        "text": "When he comes back, he discovers his wife has lost their baby and that Kendall is now acting as their surrogate, Greenlee having used his sperm donation to a clinic while he was presumed dead. Angry that he faked his death, Greenlee refuses to reunite with him, no matter how much he wants to be with her. Soon, it is revealed that the baby Kendall is pregnant with is actually her own baby with Ryan, not Greenlee's. Devastated by what she perceives as her friend's betrayal, Greenlee leaves town.\n\nAnnie and amnesia\n\nSome time later, Ryan learns that Emma McDermott is his daughter via his sperm donation as well. It is not long afterwards before he marries Emma's mother, Annie. Greenlee returns to town two years later hoping for another romantic relationship with him. She at first wants his son, Spike, in her custody, believing that he should have been hers, but later drops the custody suit she pulled on Ryan and Kendall. Later, Spike becomes deaf.\n\nRyan is shot in the head while protecting Kendall from Zach Slater's ex-lover Hannah Nichols, but manages to survive. However, his behavior becomes erratic and unusual.\n\nOn February 1 2008, he loses his memory, exactly four years of his life, thinking it is still 2004. He has forgotten about his marriage to Annie and his kids, Emma and Spike. He believes himself to be still engaged to Kendall and is lost when he discovers he is suffering from dissociative amnesia. He is in love with her, but there is one problem; she is now married to Zach. Ryan now believes that Zach has stolen Ryan's entire life, due to the fact that Zach is now owner of Cambias Industries, a title that was given to Ryan by Alexander Cambias, Sr. when he was believed to be dead, and the fact that Ryan's son considers Zach to also be his father.\n\nSome time after much upheaval of Ryan struggling to remember pieces of his life, especially his life with Annie, Greenlee has a sailboating accident when the sail hits her head. Ryan witnesses Greenlee getting hit and rescues her. Her accident makes her realize how much she wants her relationship with Aidan Devane to work. But when Ryan rescues Greenlee from her sailboat accident, the last four years of his life come rushing back to him. He fights his reawakened feelings of being in love with Greenlee as he watches how happy she and Aidan are together.\n\nAnnie grows angry and hurt when she realizes that Ryan still loves Greenlee. She starts to scheme to keep Ryan around. She even gets pregnant, but Annie loses this baby when Kendall confronts her about her scheming. Annie later confesses to Ryan for doing some of the things Kendall mentioned (everything but killing Richie Novak, her brother) and tells him how sorry she is but that she does not expect him to forgive her. She asks Ryan to leave. Ryan, devastated and terribly hurt, leaves the hospital room. He receives comfort from his friends, especially Greenlee.\n\nee also\n\n* Ryan Lavery and Gillian Andrassy"
