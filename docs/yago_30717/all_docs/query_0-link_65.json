        "text": "The Yatch Club\n\nLooking at their menus that the waitress gave to them, Jackson and Erica looked them over though they were still processing what just happened when seeing Aidan Devane with Robert and Carl. It made Eric's head explode when she saw that man sitting at the table with that other criminal including the nobody that Erica could not recognize. Pine Valley had its fair share of criminals who gotten out based on good behavior or bribed the DA or the governor of the state to let them go, blackmail whoever is in charge to get them off the hook, so this was bound to happen. But the image of Aidan Devane that people in this town had of him may be once gone since he's resorting back to his so called evil ways. If people wanted to deny that, they'll probably see from now on Aidan hanging out with the likes of a drug lord and the drug lords goon. Jackson had the urge to tell Greenlee and inform her but he remembered what Aidan told him, besides Greenlee was in Paris along with Kendall, enjoying her life with Leo Dupres. At least she would not see Aidan all depressed, angry and moody. It would break that woman's heart to see the man she once loved become who she is now.\n\nErica - \"I feel like my head is going to explode at any minute. Damn that man...\"\n\nJackson - \"Let me guess...Aidan, correct?\"\n\nErica - \"Not just him but...Gardner...what does Aidan see in him? All he's going to do is take Aidan down the wrong path again unless Aidan has any sense in his thick skull to turn him down\"\n\nJackson - \"Something tells me that Aidan has an ace up his sleeve, hopefully, if not then he's going to learn the hard way when Robert sells him out\"\n\nErica - \"I forgot...Kendall...she doesn't know about Aidan's release I bet. Looks like I need to call her-\"\n\nBianca - \"Mom, Jackson, was that Aidan I just saw when I came in? Why was he with Robert?\"\n\nJackson and Erica get up before they hug Bianca, who was here for lunch with her mom and her uncle. At least Adan didn't come across Banca or there would really be trouble for the disgraced spy.\n\nErica - \"Yes sweetheart, that was Aidan, he was released this morning. Jackson and I did expect to see him here, when we did, I let him have it\"\n\nBianca - \"I can't say that I blame you mom. What Aidan did was wrong, why was he released?\"\n\nJackson - \"That we don't know, later on when I get the chance Tad will be the first one I call for this. I'll need his expertise to look into Aidan's release\"\n\nBianca - \"And Kendall? Does she know?\"\n\nErica was about to answer but her cell phone started to ring as she took it out of her purse. She knew this was Kendall but what she would hear next would stun her.\n\nErica - \"This must be her...wait a minute it's not...hello...\"\n\nPlacing the phone next to her ear Erica heard the voice of not Kendall but a man in a French accent that was telling her something very important. Hearing every single detail from the person on the other line about Kendall caused Erica to pause and look at Bianca and Jack in disbelief but also perplexity. She was hearing everything she needed to know of the incident that Kendall, Spike and Ian were all apart of the incident that took place while they were on there way to the airfield. The man Erica was speaking too was a part of the authorities in Paris, one of the people who founded Kendall's car including the boys outside in the area. Erica couldn't believe that some idiot stuck them off the road like that causing the car Kendall drove to go off the road. For Erica she thought she was imagining something like this or she was in some kind of dream, but unfortunately not. And here Erica is with her mouth covered, feeling her eyes starting to get watery to the point where she could just break down and cry. Kendall didn't deserve this, the boys didn't deserve this, no child whether you're an adult, teenager, etc doesn't deserve to have your parent get a phone call. But it was happening and now Erica had to act, she had to move forward to the next step which is to be there for her and the boys.\n\n---------------------------------------------------------\n\nThe Slater Residence\n\nPlaying with the girls in their room, Zach heard his cell phone notify him of a text message as he got up. Leaving the room he told Alexa and Amelia that he would be back. Leaving the room, Zach looks at his phone and reads a text from Erica saying that Aidan Devane was released from prison this morning. Zach was confused and shocked to hear of the man who nearly took Kendall's head off and who could of went after the boys themselves. How in the world did this happen? Maybe Aidan was getting off for good behavior and was now on parole but that didn't matter as Zach was starting to get ticked off. Aidan was a man who many in Pine Valley including Zach himself could trust for anything due to his skill set. But that trust in Zach's eyes disappeared and went straight to dust when Aidan did something so inexcusable to Kendall. He had no right to play god when it came to the woman that he cared about in Kendall, to try and end her life for what happened to Greenlee. Immediately calling Derek, the man who started to become impatient was waiting for the Chief Of Police to answer and explained what happened. Hearing his voice, Zach gritted his teeth and started to talk before walking away from his daughters room.\n\nZach - \"Frye, what the hell is going on? Why was Aidan released...what? What do you mean you don't know why? When did this happen...look DON'T tell me to calm down Derek. It's supposed to be your job to follow up on these things...\"\n\nWalking down the step as Derek was speaking to him Zach went to the kitchen where he saw his wife Liza making dinner for all of them tonight.\n\nZach - \"Derek look when you get all the information just get back to me alright? Give me a heads up sooner rather than later...bye\"\n\nZach ends the call as he came inside the kitchen and ends the call before he slammed his first into the refrigerator.\n\nZach - \"Son of a bitch!\"\n\nLiza - \"Shhhh....not so loud Zach, the girls might hear you, what happened?\"\n\nZach - \"What happened? I'll you what happened, Aidan Devane is set free...\"\n\nLiza - \"Aidan? He's out of prison?\"\n\nZach - \"Yes and if he was right now I would beat him to bloody pulp Liza. After what he did to Kendall, he doesn't deserve to be out free\"\n\nLiza - \"Okay slow down, calm down Zach, how did this all happen? I'm sure Derek probably knows\"\n\nZach - \"He's still trying to look into that but it doesn't matter Liza. I don't trust Aidan at all after what he did, and if he thinks about apologizing to get forgiveness...he knows where he can shove it\"\n\nLiza - \"To be fair Zach and play devils advocate, I am not excusing Aidan's actions. You have to look at it from his perspective, I know Kendall didn't mean to run Greenlee off the road but it happened\"\n\nZach - \"What are you trying to say Liza?\"\n\nLiza - \"What I am trying to say is that while what happened happened, it wasn't enough for Aidan. He thought Greenlee did not justice even though she came back to Pine Valley a year ago later. Aidan had every right to be angry but went about it the wrong way. What would you do if the roles were reversed? What if that was Kendall who was ran off the road and Greenlee was behind the wheel? What would you do?\"\n\nZach looked at his wife and turned around, placing his hands on the counter before he bends over to look down. At first he thought Liza was trying to turn it around and give some kind of weak excuse, but then he thought about it and put himself in Aidan's shoes. Kendall was his wife at the time, they were going through their own issues, arguing in the car on that deadly night. Zach did everything in his power to protect Kendall and make sure that she would not go to jail but he didn't take time to consider how Aidan would feel. Heck, Aidan wasn't even around that much when they all thought Greenlee died. He disappeared for a while and then came back, moved on and did all he could to help Annie Lavery Chandler when she went through her own issues. Why didn't Zach see this coming though? Why couldn't he see Aidan going after Kendall for revenge? He should of done something to stop Aidan or at least hire someone to help Kendall at the time when she was accused of killing Stuart. There's nothing he could do to go back in time and stop Aidan, what's done is done, plain and simple. Zach wasn't here for the apology tour for the spy, but damn it, it wasn't fair at all.\n\n---------------------------------------------------------\n\nThe Lavery Residence\n\nFinishing up his drink, Ryan Lavery placed the glass on the minbar and started to clean it before he thought about the one woman he should be with right now, and that's Greenlee. When they got together before the night of the incident Chandler Mansion, the two were riding high after the two overcame everything. From Greenlee's death, to taking on David Hayward, both of them were free to be with one another, but it wasn't enough. As the years passed by they became more distant and the love they had in the beginning just was not there anymore. Even when Leo returned Greenlee could not hide her feelings for the man any longer so when she told Ryan of how she felt for David's brother, Ryan understood and decided to let Greenlee go to be with Leo if that's what Greenlee wants. In the end, Greenlee and Ryan broke up, so here Ryan was all by his lonely self. Yes, there was his daughter in Emma who always came first in his life, who was no longer a little girl now attending Pine Valley University. But Ryan still wondered what would happen with his love life, as he puts the glass in one of the cabinets of the bar and saw a picture of himself and Gillian. Walking over to it, Ryan picks it up and brushes this thumb over Gillian's face before he heard his cell phone ring.\n\nRyan - \"Who's this?\"\n\nRyan puts the picture down and answers his phone before he heard the voice of a man with a French accident telling Ryan of what happened to Kendall and the boys. Ryan's jaw dropped as he thought of his son Ian and how he may not be able to hear when authorities, EMT found him. Rubbing his forehead and closing his eyes, Ryan nodded to what else the man had to say.\n\nRyan - \"Yeah...I understand sir...thank you for telling me about this...I am heading to Paris right now as we speak. Again, thank you, bye\"\n\nRyan ends the call and went upstairs to his bedroom before he took out a suitcase, starting to pack many various things from clothes, toothbrush, toothpaste, etc. There was no telling how this was going to turn out but Ian needed his dad and if he's in Paris for about a month or so, then so be it. His son comes first, as Ryan finished packing then took out his cell phone to call Emma, hearing her voicemail but at the same time the doorbell ring, so Ryan sighed and went downstairs.\n\nRyan - \"Emma, sweetheart, listen, don't come home tonight when you're done with your classes. Something just came up with your brother Ian, it's an emergency so I need to be there for him. Just know that I love you and will call you when I land in Paris...\"\n\nRyan quickly goes up to the door and opens it before he saw the sight of an alive Gillian Andrassy standing there, looking at Ryan herself with a small smile. Ryan dropped on the phone on accident from seeing Gillian herself.\n\nRyan - \"Gillian...is that...you?\"\n\nGillian - \"Yes Ryan, it's me alright, but I need your help. They're after me and if they find me...I am a goner Ryan...I need your help, please\"\n\nRyan could see that Gillian was in trouble based upon the look on her face and the sound of her voice. He was still taking in the sight of Gillian as it felt too real for this to happen, so you couldn't blame him for feeling speechless. When he was close enough to Gillian, he touched her face with his hands and cupped it while Gillian closed her eyes, enjoying Ryan's touch and remembered the times where they used to kiss one another or hold each other in their arms after they made love. All of it just felt so good, not even Greenlee could make Ryan feel this way as he leaned in and passionately kissed Gillian, taking his sweet time with her. Gillian never stopped Ryan from kissing her, he had the right to feel and kiss her however he wanted. Hell, she didn't even think of to ask Ryan if he was married or with someone like Greenlee, it would not have mattered because of the love she has for Ryan. All of the danger and everything else could wait for a bit, as now Ryan and Gillian kissed turned into something passionate before it broke. Ryan immediately hugged Gillian before the waterworks came into play and tears dropped from both of their eyes. Gillian was back where she belonged and that was with her knight and shinning armor.\n\n---------------------------------------------------------\n\n---------------------------------------------------------\n\nThe Yatch Club\n\nErica nodded and nodded again as one of the authorities told her about the incident including what they found when someone called them. Every detail was heartbreaking to Erica who started to cry herself but tried to be strong for Kendall and the boys. The three of them meant everything to Erica along with Bianca, Miranda and Gabby , etc. Especially for Jackson's children who were like her own children to her. She didn't want to see them down and out or hurt, coming to terms with their own demise. If there's anything Erica taught her children and grandchildren, was to never take anything for granted. Erica had so many experiences on life or death it was hard for her to keep count but she was still standing here today. Would Kendall be okay though? Kendall has had her fair share of health scares in the past so her being involved in a car crash was going to obviously cause her more health issues. Jackson and Bianca didn't know what was going on, they could only tell from the look of her face something wasn't right. The only thing they could tell is that something happened and its one of two things, she's either in trouble for breaking the law or it has to do with someone in the family.\n\nErica - \"Yes, thank you sir...we'll be right there\"\n\nErica ended the call and you can tell she was shaking from all of the things one of the authorities told her. Jackson comforted her and rubbed Erica's back but he didn't know still what happened.\n\nJackson - \"Hey, what's wrong Erica? Is everything alright?\"\n\nErica - \"No Jackson, everything is not alright...Kendall, Ian and Spike, all of them were in an incident\"\n\nBianca - \"Oh my god, are they alright, what happened mom?\"\n\nErica - \"They were on their way to the airfield before a tow truck crashed in to them. They were ran off the road and landed into the woods\"\n\nBianca - \"Oh no...poor Kendall...the boys...have they been founded mom?\"\n\nErica - \"The boys were and they weren't in good shape so they're going to the hospital in Paris. They still need to find Kendall\"\n\nJackson - \"Was she in the car with them?\"\n\nErica - \"Of course she was Jackson, where else would she be?\"\n\nJackson - \"Maybe she was trying to get help nearby...look, we need go and be there for them\"\n\nErica - \"You're right Jackson, I will call the airplane to get the jet ready for take off. Were going to Paris immediately but first we need to go home and pack\"\n\nBianca - \"I'll stay here in Pine Valley with the girls mom but I will let them know everything of what we just find out. Please let me know what happened to Kendall, Spike and Ian when you get more information\"\n\nErica - \"We will Bianca, just stay strong for the girls, for me and Jackson okay? We love you\"\n\nBianca - \"I love you guys too, now go, tell Kendall I said hello and that I love her. The same goes for the boys\"\n\nHugging her mom and Jackson, Bianca followed her mom and Jackson out of the Yatch Club before Jackson asked the cashier for a rain check. Getting that out of the way, Jackson and Erica went to their home to start packing while Bianca followed them to the home she lives in with the girls. Immediately Bianca called Miranda and Gabby to let them know about Kendall and the boys. Ian and Spike were her nephew as they meant so much to her, but despite all of what happened between Kendall and Zach, she considered Zach a part of their family still. Yes, she knew Erica had her issues with the man when he ultimately choose Liza over him but that didn't change how Bianca felt about Zach. The guy had to be hurting deep down inside when it comes to Ian and Spike, but also Kendall as her and Zach had a lot of history together that's kind of complicated. Bianca wished they did not split up but maybe it was for the best as Zach was happy with Liza. He was still an uncle to Miranda and treated her like a daughter despite Zach having twin daughters in Alexa and Amelia. When Jackson and Erica were all done packing they walk downstairs as the two hug Bianca again, who hugs them back before they leave together for Paris. Watching them, Bianca calls Zach so that he can know what's going on, then she had to call Ryan, as both fathers were going to be there.\n\n---------------------------------------------------------\n\nThe Slater Residence\n\nLiza puts her hand on Zach's shoulder comforting him, who tries to calm down after he called Derek about Aidan. Zach was getting angrier about this but for good reason and all he was concerned about was how the boys and Kendall would feel. Aidan broke Kendall's trust and the trust he had with everyone in Pine Valley, well maybe not everyone but others like Tad, Jesse, etc would be warry of Aidan himself. Aidan had a lot of work to do to gain the trust of those he hurt but for Zach he didn't care what Aidan did, if it affected his family in a negative way then he'll make sure Aidan pays and taking him out for good. No one could talk him out of that, not even his own wife who had to know everything that Zach does everyday whether he's at the casino or somewhere else. And Zach has been honest with Liza every step of the way, Liza understood Zach's life and what he's done. She doesn't agree with all of it but he was still a good man and a good father to his children. All Liza wants is for Zach to life his life happy and not full of rage when someone he hates is back in his life. Liza wraps her arms around her husband's waist and rest her head on her shoulder, kissing the side of his lips.\n\nLiza - \"I wish I could take away what you're feeling now Zach. You feel so tense\"\n\nZach - \"You're right...I am tense and just...pissed off. Why the hell did he have to come back in our lives?\"\n\nLiza - \"Right now Zach you have a family that needs you. We need you...I need you too baby, just don't do anything stupid\"\n\nZach - \"And I won't Liza, I wont'...I just need you. You're my comfort, my strength...my everything\"\n\nZach turned around and faced Liza before he caressed her cheek including brushed a stay piece of her red hair away from her beautiful eyes. Liza stared into those dark brown eyes of Zach's and was nearly lost looking into them before Zach caressed her cheek with his thump again.\n\nZach - \"I love you Liza\"\n\nLiza - \"And I love you too Zach\"\n\nThe couple were about to kiss until Zach heard his cell phone as he sighed and shook his head. What a way to interrupt and nearly a ruin an intimate moment between the two lovers huh?\n\nZach - \"Now what?\"\n\nLiza - \"It's okay Zach, just answer it...we got all day anyway. Maybe after the call we can put the kids to bed early and have a night by our own\"\n\nShe winks at her husband before Zach grinned a bit before taking out the cell phone and answering it, seeing Bianca on the caller ID.\n\nZach - \"Hey Bianca, what's up? What...Bianca, what are you talking about, stop it okay? No...no...are they okay? Where are they? Oh no...okay uh...I will be there in a couple of minutes. Tell you mom, Ryan and Jackson I will be there, don't leave with me as well...alright. If you hear anything about Kendall and the boys let me know...thanks...bye\"\n\nLiza - \"What happened?\"\n\nZach - \"Spike, Ian, Kendall all of them were involved in a car crash that caused them to go off of the road. Spike and Ian were found, but they're badly hurt\"\n\nLiza - \"Oh no...and Kendall?\"\n\nZach - \"No sign of her...I have to be there for the boys Liza. I'm gonna pack up and then leave Liza\"\n\nLiza - \"Of course Zach, I understand honey, just say goodbye to the girls before you leave. And when everything is taken of...come back home to me and the girls. The boys and Kendall are in my prayers right now\"\n\nZach smiled a bit before pulling Liza in for a passionate kiss, as he ended it slowly before he went upstairs. Passing the girls room and reaching the bedroom he took out his suitcase before starting to pack everything else up while the boys and Kendall were on his mind. They were supposed to be here today of all days to stop by the town and visit them. Zach loved spending time with the boys and watching hockey games of the red wings whenever they were on, just him, Spike and Ian. Yes, Spike was not his son and he knew Ryan was his dad but this involved Lavery too since Ian's his son as well. The boys were brothers and their bond couldn't be denied or broken, even through tragedy. Zach and Ryan need to support one another so that the boys can be healthy and come out stronger, but what about Kendall? Zach remembered her medical issues when she was pregnant with the boys different occasions and had her own incidents, even when Kendall gave birth to Ian during the tornado, Kendall never had it easy. Who knows what's going on right now? Leaving the room Zach talks to the girls in their home and tells them he's going away before he hugs the girls. Walking down the steps, Liza hugs him before Zach kissed her passionately again, then leaves the house.\n\n---------------------------------------------------------\n\nThe Lavery Residence\n\nWiping away his tears and Gillian's, Ryan quickly pulls her inside before he looks around to make sure no one has seen her. It was clear the moment Gillian showed up on his doorstep and what she told Ryan, Gillian was in a lot of trouble, trouble that Ryan didn't know of but this was who went through a lot of mayhem and chaos in his time. The adventures he had with Greenlee, Gillian, all of that made him stronger in the end including to keep his guard up at all times when someone came to town with an agenda against him. Hell, David Hayward framed him once for something he didn't do as it then turned to Greenlee who confessed causing the two to go on this wild goose chase that ended in David Hayward returning to Pine Valley. Did Gillian know anything about that? Well of course she doesn't, but who knows what's going on in Gillian's mind as she looks around the home, never seeing this before in her entire life. There were a lot of things, a lot of places she didn't recognize in this town though there were some she remembered, like Wildwind that was still up and running. Closing the door behind him, Ryan locked it with his keys so no one could get in, at least for right now until Ryan leaves for Paris.\n\nRyan - \"I still can't believe you're here Gillian...what happened? Why are you here? Who's after you, I have so many questions\"\n\nGillian - \"It's better that we sit down and talk then standing...I have a lot to get off my chest of what you don't know Ryan\"\n\nRyan - \"Of course Gillian...it's just that I have an emergency right now with my son, he got in a bad incident and he needs me\"\n\nGillian - \"Oh...i am so sorry Ryan, i never knew you had a son of all things but not surprised. I always knew you make a great father to any child you've raised\"\n\nRyan - \"Don't be sorry and don't apologize. Come on...you're coming with me to Paris, you can explain everything to me but we need to be careful okay?\"\n\nGillian - \"Right...I am ready...we can do this...together\"\n\nThe two smile at one another, taking each other's hand as he got his luggage with him before the two left the home. They made sure to watch every step they made because whoever is after Gillian has an agenda, but at least the two are working together as a team. Getting inside Ryan's car, he drove straight to the airfield after he called in to get his jet set up. Arriving at the airfield, Ryan and Gillian are greeted by the pilot and stewards before they make themselves comfortable.\n\nRyan - \"So...what happened Gillian? I saw you die right in front of me, there was only so much I could do to save you Gillian. Your organs were given to other people\"\n\nGillian - \"Ryan, that wasn't me you saw die right in front of you, that was someone else who looked like me. After I died my body was taken somewhere else in Valdez where no one could find me\"\n\nRyan - \"Who took you there Gillian and why?\"\n\nGillian - \"It was Alex...Alexandra Devane who took me along with the DVX. They held me prisoner for son long\"\n\nRyan - \"Alex? Alex Devane you meant? Dimitri's ex-wife? Does Dimitri know about all of this still?\"\n\nGillian - \"No...no one does Ryan except you and Alex. She's after me and if anyone else gets in her way, yourself...they'll be dead...you'll be dead Ryan\"\n\nRyan - \"I won't let that happen, I am not letting Alex or anyone from the DVX hurt you okay Gillian? I am going to keep you and everyone else safe\"\n\nGillian - \"What about your son, your daughter? They come first Ryan, they mean the world to you and I can't bear anything\n\nRyan - \"And so do you Gillian, like I said, I will do whatever it takes to keep you safe. I'll rent us an airbnb that way no one can find you, one that's away on the outskirts of Paris. But you'll need to stay there until I come back but don't worry about it...I got something planned\"\n\nGillian - \"Well whatever else you have planned I hope it works out for all of us\"\n\nRyan - \"I believe it will...and once this is behind us...I hope there's a future for you and me out there. This time, I am not leaving you behind or losing you again...ever\"\n\nRyan leans in one more time before he brushes his lips onto Gillian who returns the favor. The two of them were on a jet but it didn't matter, as they started to kiss again with Ryan caressing her face again. Gillian runs her hand through his hair as she closed her eyes, wishing this wasn't a dream, but as she opened her eyes again this was no dream. The kiss slowly broke and Gillian laid her head on Ryan's shoulder, with the two still taking, basking in the moment of seeing each other for the first time in which felt like years. Gillian, while she was a prisoner under the DVX wasn't up to date on a lot of things but every time Alexandra came by and taunted her about what everyone in her family was doing, she knew of Greenlee and Kendall being in her life. As much as she wanted to respect Ryan's private life she didn't get the feeling he was with anyone, but Gillian didn't want to think of that now. The only thing that matters right now is making sure Gillian herself was safe so that Alex and the DVX won't come after her anymore. Closing her eyes, Gillian decides to at least rest for the time being before Ryan wraps an arm around her and close his eyes as well, feeling a little bit better though Spike and Ian were on his mind.\n\nEND OF EPISODE 7"
