Annie McDermott loved her husband Terry.

So why question him when he told her he wanted to go to a sperm bank to conceive, claiming he had genetic disabilities in his family? Annie was artificially inseminated and nine months later gave birth to her daughter, Emma. As Emma aged, Annie discovered that Terry was a sexual predator that had seduced many teenaged girls. Fearful for Emma, she divorced Terry and ran off with her daughter before Terry could be awarded custody.
