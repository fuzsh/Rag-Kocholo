The Black Crowes are an American rock band formed in 1989. Their discography includes nine studio albums, four live albums and several charting singles. The band was signed to Def American Recordings in 1989 by producer George Drakoulias and released their debut album, Shake Your Money Maker, the following year. The follow-up, The Southern Harmony and Musical Companion, reached the top of the Billboard 200 in 1992.

After a hiatus between 2002 and 2005, the band released Warpaint, which hit number 5 on the Billboard chart. After the release of a double album, the greatest hits-like and mostly acoustic Croweology in August 2010, the band started a 20th anniversary tour that was followed by an ongoing second hiatus. The band has announced that they will return in early 2013.

The band has sold over 30 million albums, and is listed at number 92 on VH1’s “100 Greatest Artists of Hard Rock”. They were also labeled by Melody Maker as “The Most Rock ‘n’ Roll Rock ‘n’ Roll Band in the World” and the readers of Rolling Stone voted them ‘Best New American Band’ in 1990.
