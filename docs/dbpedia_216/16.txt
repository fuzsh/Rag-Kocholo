The Black Crowes are an American rock band formed in Atlanta, Georgia, in 1984. Their discography includes nine studio albums, four live albums and several charting singles. The band was signed to Def American Recordings in 1989 by producer George Drakoulias and released their debut album, Shake Your Money Maker, the following year. Their follow-up, The Southern Harmony and Musical Companion, reached the top of the Billboard 200 in 1992. The albums Amorica (1994), Three Snakes and One Charm (1996), By Your Side (1999), and Lions (2001) followed, with each showing moderate popularity but failing to capture the chart successes of the band’s first two albums. After a hiatus from 2002 to 2005, the band regrouped and toured for several years before releasing Warpaint in 2008, which reached number 5 on the Billboard chart.

Following the release of their greatest hits/acoustic double album Croweology in August 2010, the band started a 20th anniversary tour that was followed by a second hiatus. After touring in 2013, the band announced another breakup in 2015, reforming in late 2019 to announce a 2020 tour in support of the 30th anniversary of Shake Your Money Maker. By this point the band had none of its original line-up left except for Chris and Rich Robinson, the only two constant members of the band over its entire history.

As of August 2023, the current lineup of the band includes the Robinson brothers, longtime bassist Sven Pipien, and new members Nico Bereciartua (lead guitar), Cully Symington (drums) and Erik Deutsch (keyboards). Their latest album, Happiness Bastards, was released in March 2024.

The Southern Harmony and Musical Companion is the second studio album by American rock band the Black Crowes, released on May 12, 1992. It was the first album by the band to feature Marc Ford on lead guitar, replacing Jeff Cease, who was fired the year before, and the first to feature keyboardist Eddie Harsch. The album’s name derives from the full name of the Southern Harmony, an influential 1835 hymnal compiled by William Walker.

It was a record for an album to feature four album rock number-one hits (previously set by Tom Petty in 1989, with three). The album itself reached the top spot of the Billboard 200 album chart, propelled by the success of these singles.

[2023’s reissue of the album adds two extra discs. One consists of a well-recorded, very energetic live show recorded in 1993 with all the songs from the album represented (apart from “Time Will Tell”). The other disc has B-sides, including the very good “Darling of the Underground Press,” a beautifully arranged, lyrically biting midtempo track that would have fit in with the album perfectly, a new mix of the cover of “99 Pounds,” and five songs recorded live in the studio. These last tracks have never been released before, and it’s fun to hear the band running through some of the record’s songs in a more relaxed setting. The slowed-down take on “Sting Me” is especially nice. The set also comes with a batch of extra goodies like sheet music, lithographs, and remembrances from both Robinsons.]

By Your Side is the fifth studio album by American rock band The Black Crowes. It was released January 12, 1999 on Columbia Records, following the band’s move from American Recordings, after second guitarist Marc Ford and bassist Johnny Colt had left the band in 1997. Audley Freed and Sven Pipien were hired as the new guitarist and bassist, respectively, although Rich Robinson played all the guitar parts on the album. By Your Side was recorded in New York City during the second quarter of 1998 and produced by Kevin Shirley. It comprised songs written in the studio, revised songs from pre-production and re-recorded songs from the abandoned 1997 album Band.

The Black Crowes promoted By Your Side by performing on numerous television programs in North America and Europe. The album debuted at its peak position of number 26 on the Billboard 200 and generally received positive reviews. While some critics depreciated By Your Side for its similarity to albums by Rod Stewart and The Rolling Stones, most reviewers lauded The Black Crowes’ return to the straightforward approach of their debut album, Shake Your Money Maker (1990). Chris Robinson’s singing and Rich’s guitar playing also won praise from critics, though reviews of the lyrics were mixed.

Beginning in February 1999, the band toured North American theaters for two months in support of the album. Setlists from the tour, known as the “Souled Out Tour”, typically included more than half the album’s songs. The concerts were followed by a short co-headlining tour of US amphitheaters with Lenny Kravitz. The band spent the remainder of the summer opening for Aerosmith’s European tour.

Lions is the sixth studio album by American rock band The Black Crowes. It was released May 7, 2001 as their first album on V2 Records following their departure from Columbia, and is their only studio album to feature guitarist Audley Freed. Lions was recorded in New York City in January and February of that year, and was produced by Don Was. Bass guitar duties were shared by Rich Robinson and Was, as Greg Rzab had left the band and was not replaced until the tour that followed the release of the album.

The album debuted on the Billboard 200 at its peak position of 20, selling more than 53,000 copies in its first week. Lions received mixed reviews; although the overall sound of the album generally garnered praise, a frequent complaint was the lack of “memorable” songs. The critics who rated Lions lowest considered it a poor imitation of the band’s influences, such as Led Zeppelin.

The band supported Lions with two North American tours (one with Oasis co-headlining), and a short tour of Europe and Japan in between. Soundboard recordings of several concerts were available for download to those who owned the album. Following the tour, the band went on hiatus until 2005.

Shake Your Money Maker is the debut studio album by American rock band the Black Crowes, released on February 13, 1990, on Def American Recordings. It is the only album by the band to feature guitarist Jeff Cease. The album is named after a classic blues song written by Elmore James. The Black Crowes have played the song live many times over the years, but it is not included on this album.

Shake Your Money Maker peaked at No. 4 on the Billboard 200, and two of its singles, “Hard to Handle” and “She Talks to Angels”, reached No. 1 on the Mainstream Rock Tracks chart. “Jealous Again”, “Twice As Hard” and “Seeing Things” were also charting singles in the United States. Shake Your Money Maker is the Black Crowes’ best selling album, having sold more than 5 million copies.

On January 8, 2021, the Black Crowes announced that a 30th anniversary edition of the album would be released on February 26, 2021. The new version contains the original tracks remastered in addition to three previously unreleased songs, outtakes, two demos from the Mr. Crowe’s Garden era, and a live performance set recorded in 1990 at Center Stage in Atlanta. Previously unreleased track “Charming Mess” was released on the same day as the announcement.

1972 is a studio EP by American rock band The Black Crowes, released on May 4, 2022. It is an album of cover songs.

Brothers Chris and Rich Robinson, who reformed the Black Crowes in 2019, thought an album of cover songs would be a good step toward releasing an album of new material. Rolling Stone notes: “As the Robinson brothers attempt to rebuild their creative partnership, the sessions were like ‘good baby steps’ for them, Chris says, ‘a less-pressure situation’ than new songs.” The Black Crowes plan to begin recording an album of new material in January 2023.

The EP contains covers of rock songs from 1972: The Rolling Stones’s “Rocks Off”, T. Rex’s “The Slider”, Rod Stewart’s “You Wear It Well”, Little Feat’s “Easy to Slip”, David Bowie’s “Moonage Daydream”, and the Temptations’ “Papa Was a Rollin’ Stone”.

Alfred Matthew “Weird Al” Yankovic (born October 23, 1959) is an American singer-songwriter, musician, parodist, record producer, satirist, music video director, film producer, actor, and author. Yankovic is known for his humorous songs that make light of popular culture and often parody specific songs by contemporary musical acts. Since his first-aired comedy song in 1976, he has sold more than 12 million albums (as of 2007), recorded more than 150 parody and original songs, and has performed more than 1,000 live shows. His works have earned him three Grammy Awards among nine nominations, four gold records, and six platinum records in the United States. Yankovic’s first top ten Billboard album (Straight Outta Lynwood) and single (“White & Nerdy“) were both released in 2006, nearly three decades into his career.

Yankovic’s success comes in part from his effective use of music video to further parody popular culture, the song’s original artist, and the original music videos themselves, scene-for-scene in some cases. He directed later videos himself and went on to direct for other artists including Ben Folds, Hanson, The Black Crowes, and The Presidents of the United States of America. In addition to recording his albums, Yankovic wrote and starred in the film UHF and The Weird Al Show. He has also made guest appearances on many television shows, in addition to starring in Al TV specials on MTV.

On April 9, 2004, Yankovic’s parents were found dead in their Fallbrook, California, home, apparently the victims of accidental carbon monoxide poisoning from their fireplace that had been recently lit. The flue was closed, which trapped the carbon monoxide gas inside the house, suffocating them. Several hours after his wife notified him of his parents’ death, Yankovic went on with his concert in Mankato, Minnesota, saying that “since my music had helped many of my fans through tough times, maybe it would work for me as well” and that it would “at least … give me a break from sobbing all the time.” Although Yankovic played the concert as planned, a scheduled meet and greet following the concert was canceled.
