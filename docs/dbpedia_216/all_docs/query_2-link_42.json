        "text": "It’s Saturday and I’d like to welcome you to my latest weekly new music review. All picks are on albums that appeared yesterday (July 19).\n\nBeachwood Sparks/Gentle Samurai\n\nBeachwood Sparks are an alternative country band formed in Los Angeles in 1997 by Brent Radebaker (bass) and Christopher Gunst (guitar). After releasing their first two albums in 2000 and 2001, Beachwood Sparks were on and off, with their members mostly focused on side projects. From their fourth and latest album Across the River of Stars, produced by Chris Robinson of The Black Crowes, here’s Gentle Samurai. The pleasant, melodic song was co-written by Radebaker, Gunst and David Scher (guitar). The group’s current line-up also includes Ben Knight (guitar), Jen Cohen Gunst (keyboards) and Andres Renteria (drums).\n\nOneida/Here It Comes\n\nOneida are an experimental rock band from New York, whose music has included elements of hard rock, garage punk, stoner rock, psychedelia and synth pop. They came together in Brooklyn in 1997 and released their first album A Place Called El Shaddai’s in September of that year. Oneida’s current line-up features co-founders Kid Millions (drums, vocals), Bobby Matador (organ, guitar, bass, vocals) and Hanoi Jane (guitar, bass), along with Barry London (synthesizers, organ, effects) and Shahin Motia (guitar). Here It Comes is a track from their 17th full-length album Expensive Air – definitely a bit on the experimental side, but it has something!\n\nBeta Radio/Find Someone\n\nBeta Radio are a modern Americana duo from North Carolina, comprised of Ben Mabry (vocals, guitar, glockenspiel, harmonium, piano, additional arrangements) and Brent Holloman (guitar, banjo, vocals, bass, piano, additional arrangements). In April 2010, they self-released their debut album Seven Sisters. Their sixth and new album is titled Waiting For the End to Come. My pick is Find Someone. Amid the relatively sparse musical arrangement, Mabry’s and Hollman’s harmony singing nicely stands out.\n\nKiely Connell/Through to You\n\nKiely Connell is a Nashville, Tenn.-based country and Americana singer-songwriter. Her Spotify profile notes, She writes songs that have a gothic western aesthetic, a blend of somber poetry and western melodies delivered with her rich and brooding voice. Her gritty voice merges gritty blues with an ethereal upper register, leaving audiences comparing her to the likes of Patsy Cline, Joan Baez and Joni Mitchell. Off her sophomore album My Own Company, here’s Through to You. Love the country rock sound!\n\nChris Cain/Fear Is My New Roommate\n\nThis brings me to Chris Cain, a blues and jazz-inspired guitarist who debuted in 1987 with an award-nominated album Late Night City Blues. From his website: At the age of eight, Cain taught himself to play guitar and began playing professionally before he was eighteen. Chris studied music at San Jose City College, and was soon teaching jazz improvisation on campus. Over the next twenty years, Cain would also master piano, bass guitar, clarinet, alto and tenor saxophone. Here’s Fear Is My New Roommate, a tasty track from Cain’s new album Good Intentions Gone Bad.\n\nDeep Purple/Pictures of You\n\nOnce again, I’m thrilled to highlight new music by Deep Purple. My longtime favorite hard rock band are now out with their 23rd studio album =1. Previously, I featured the upfront singles Lazy Sod and Portable Door. Pictures of You, credited to the members of Deep Purple and producer Bob Ezrin, also first appeared as a single ahead of the album, on June 5. =1 is the group’s first album with Northern Irish guitarist Simon McBride who replaced Steve Morse in 2022. Deep Purple, whose remarkable run started in 1968 and was paused by a hiatus between 1976 and 1984, are currently touring in Europe and are scheduled to hit the U.S. and Canada between August 14 and September 8.\n\nSources: Wikipedia; Curation Records website; Oneida Bandcamp page; Chris Cain website; YouTube; Spotify\n\nIf there ever was any need for a reminder why good ole rock & roll will never go out of style, New York City’s magnificent Radio City Music Hall was the place to be last Saturday (April 27). That’s where The Black Crowes performed before an enthusiastic crowd as part of their ongoing Happiness Bastards Tour. A few weeks ago, I coincidentally had found out about the show when watching a YouTube clip of Larkin Poe, which listed the storied venue among their upcoming gigs. When I saw they would open for the Crowes, I had to check for a way in. Luckily, I found a verified resale ticket at a reasonable price.\n\nBefore getting to The Black Crows, I have to address Larkin Poe. Not only was it thanks to the southern sister act of Rebecca Lovell (guitar, vocals) and Megan Lovell (lap steel, backing vocals) I was there in the first place, but these ladies tore up the stage, even though their setup was way more modest than the Crowes’. These amazing musicians and vocalists were backed by their regular touring bassist Tarka Layman and an African American drummer whose name I didn’t catch. He may have been a sub for Kevin McGowan.\n\nWhile I started paying attention to Larkin Poe about six years ago and have covered them on previous occasions, for example here and here, I’m not very familiar with the titles of their songs. As best as I can tell, their 30-minute set primarily drew on material from Blood Harmony, their most recent studio album released in November 2022. I believe the songs included Summertime Sunset, Kick the Blues, Georgia Off My Mind and Bad Spell. Additionally, I seemed to recognize Wanted Woman/AC/DC, a track from their September 2017 studio album Peach.\n\nLast but not least, there were two excellent covers: Jessica, a sweet instrumental by the late Dickey Betts, off Brothers and Sisters, the fourth studio album by The Allman Brothers Band from August 1973; and Preachin’ Blues by Delta blues guitarist and singer Son House. Before giving you a little flavor of Larkin Poe’s fire power, I have to say I feel sorry for the boneheads who came late and evidently had no interest in seeing Larkin Poe and/or probably had no clue who they are. I also find it extremely disrespectful to walk in while musicians pour out their hearts and souls on stage. I just wish entertainment venues would ban this dreadful practice! Here’s Jessica and Kick the Blues, Larkin Poe style!\n\nAfter a short intermission it was time for The Black Crows to land and take the stage; or perhaps I should better say soar. Delivering kickass rock & roll is so much better than fighting with each other. Brothers Chris Robinson (lead vocals) and Rich Robinson (guitar, backing vocals), who form the band’s core, certainly know a thing or two about the latter. Luckily, it appears their volatile relationship is a matter of the past – keeping fingers crossed it’ll stay that way!\n\nAfter the Crowes concluded their Shake Your Moneymaker Tour in March 2023 to celebrate the 30th anniversary of their popular February 1990 debut album, they continued to be on the road through much of 2023 and into this year before they announced their current Happiness Bastards Tour in January. That 30-plus-date series is in support of their new album of the same name, which came out on March 15. Perhaps not surprisingly, music from their 10th studio album – their first of original music in 15 years – featured prominently in their set. Let’s check out some of the goodies!\n\nAfter energetically kicking off with Bedside Manners and Rats and Clowns, the first two tracks off the Happiness Bastards album, Chris Robinson cheerfully announced that in addition to new songs they would also play some old motherfuckers. Of course, no good rock & roll show can be without f-words, the more the merrier! I’ll give you Twice As Hard, the fucking opener of the Crowes’ above-mentioned epic debut Shake Your Money Maker. That motherfucker was co-written by the two brothers.\n\nOkay, I shall behave. No more f-words! Here’s Wanting and Waiting, my early favorite from the Crowes’ new album. That m… – nope, I’m not gonna say it! – was also co-written by the Robinson brothers.\n\nI suppose the next song doesn’t need much of an introduction. Penned by Otis Redding, who Chris Robinson noted hailed from Georgia as well, along with Al Bell and Allen Jones, Hard to Handle was first popularized in 1968 by the Stax recording artist. Robinson also acknowledged that song had done much for the Crowes. Indeed. It became their first single to top Billboard’s Mainstream Rock chart. I think it’s fair to say it also still is the group’s signature song. Let’s listen to that motherfucker – opps, I did it again!\n\nAlrighty, one more clip: Remedy, a track from The Black Crowes’ sophomore album The Southern Harmony and Musical Companion, which appeared in May 1992. Another co-write by the Robinson brothers, the song was also released separately as the album’s lead single in April of the same year. It became their third no. 1 on Billboard’s Mainstream Rock chart.\n\nAfter the crowd screamed for more, The Black Crowes obliged with a cover of White Light/White Heat, the title track of the second studio album by The Velvet Underground released in January 1968. The song was written by Lou Reed. Earlier in their set, the Crowes also delivered an energetic rendition of High School Confidential, the title track of the 1958 U.S. crime drama motion picture, co-written by Jerry Lee Lewis and Ron Hargrave, and performed by The Killer. Here’s the full setlist, as documented on Setlist.fm.\n\nSetlist\n\n• Bedside Manners\n\n• Rats and Clowns\n\n• Twice as Hard\n\n• Gone\n\n• Then She Said My Name\n\n• Cross Your Fingers\n\n• Seeing Things\n\n• High School Confidential (Jerry Lee Lewis cover)\n\n• Thorn in My Pride\n\n• Wanting and Waiting\n\n• Hard to Handle (Otis Redding cover)\n\n• She Talks to Angels\n\n• Flesh Wound\n\n• I Ain’t Hiding\n\n• Jealous Again\n\n• Remedy\n\nEncore:\n\n• White Light/White Heat (The Velvet Underground cover)\n\nI thought The Black Crowes delivered a great show. Chris Robinson’s vocals sounded strong, and his brother Rich Robinson was compelling on guitar. At one point, Chris also showcased his impressive harmonica skills. The Robinson brothers were backed by a formidable band featuring Sven Pipien (bass), who previously toured with them from 1997 until 2015; Nico Bereciartua (guitar, backing vocals); Erik Deutsch (keyboards, backing vocals) and Cully Symington (drums, percussion). The line-up also included backing vocalists Mackenzie Adams and Leslie Grant who added a neat soul vibe to the performance.\n\nThe Black Crows are flying next to Washington, D.C. (tomorrow, April 30), followed by Charlotte, N.C. (May 1); Bethlehem, Pa. (May 3); Atlantic City, N.J. (May 4); and Philadelphia, Pa. (May 7). The full schedule of the Happiness Bastards Tour is here.\n\nAlso, let’s not forget Larkin Poe, who to me were just as compelling as the Crowes. The sister act’s upcoming gigs include Bonnaroo Music and Arts Festival, Manchester, Tenn. (Jun 14); Off North Shore – Skokie Music Festival, Skokie, Ill., Jun 21-22; Rock, Ribs & Ridges, Augusta, N.J., Jun 30; and High Sierra Music Festival, Quincy, Calif., Jul 4-7.\n\nI also noticed that in September, Larkin Poe are playing the annual Sea.Hear.Now Festival in Asbury Park, N.J., which is right in my backyard. Unfortunately, tickets are already sold out. Well, it’s a good thing for the organizers. You can check out Larkin Poe’s full schedule here.\n\nSources: Wikipedia; Setlist.fm; The Black Crowes website; Larkin Poe website; YouTube\n\nUntil last year, Ian Hunter wasn’t exactly on my radar screen. That changed quickly after I had heard Bed of Roses, one of the upfront singles of his April 2023 album Defiance Part 1 that I subsequently reviewed here. Last Friday, April 19, the ex-Mott the Hoople lead vocalist and guitarist came back with Defiance Part 2: Fiction. While it mirrors the approach and sound of the predecessor, the sequel is a fun listening experience reaffirming that Hunter at 84 years remains a compelling vocalist and songwriter.\n\nLike Defiance Part 1, the second installment features contributions from an impressive array of other artists. Some, such as Def Leppard’s Joe Elliott, Stone Temple Pilots’ Robert DeLeo, the late Taylor Hawkins and the late Jeff Beck, also were on the first album. Others like Brian May, Lucinda Williams and The Black Crowes’ Chris Robinson and Rich Robinson are new guests.\n\nOnce again, longtime collaborator Andy York, who is also a member of John Mellencamp’s touring band, co-produced the album with Hunter. More background on how the Defiance concept came together is in the above-noted review. Let’s get to some music from Defiance Part 2: Fiction.\n\nSince I included the opener People in my latest weekly new music review, I’m skipping it here and go right to Fiction. Like all of the album’s other nine tracks the music and the lyrics were solely written by Hunter. Among others, it features ex-Mott the Hoople keyboarder Morgan Fisher who has also played with many other artists and more recently expanded into photography.\n\nThe 3rd Rail is a ballad dedicated to Jeff Beck. The English guitarist can also be heard on lead guitar. It was one of his final studio recordings prior to his death from bacterial meningitis at age 78 in January 2023. Johnny Depp contributed acoustic and electric rhythm guitar.\n\nPrecious, which became the album’s first upfront single on February 15, features ex-Foo Fighters drummer Taylor Hawkins, Joe Elliott on backing vocals and Queen’s Brian May on guitar. “We got on really well with Queen,” Hunter recalled in a statement on his website. “When you’re in a band you can get really bored with each other but they were just normal blokes, it was like being on the road with nine guys instead of just five. Freddie was hilarious and I’ve kept up with Brian to this day.”\n\nOn What Would I Do Without You, another ballad, Hunter shares lead vocals with Lucinda Williams, who has become one of my favorite artists over the past couple of years. “Lucinda and her husband came to one of my shows in Nashville,” Hunter recalled. “I love her voice, there’s something very childlike, and you just know it’s her straight away. You don’t forget that voice.” They do sound great together!\n\nThe last track I’d like to call out is Everybody’s Crazy But Me. The nice rocker, among others, features Hawkins (drums), Waddy Wachtel (guitar) and Benmont Tench (organ), formerly of Tom Petty and the Heartbreakers.\n\nCommenting on his harder lyrical edge to examine contemporary issues on Defiance Part 2: Fiction, Hunter stated, “I was trying to avoid all that on PART 1 but on PART 2, it caught up with me. Most of those were written two or three years back, so I wanted to get it all out before whatever takes hold in November. It would be dated after the fact.”\n\nHe added, “I’m neither left nor particularly right. I’m just straight down the middle. And so I tried to write from that point of view. An eagle has two wings and if one falls off it perishes. That’s what I’m trying to get at. A bit of common sense, you know, Thomas Paine stuff.”\n\nApparently, Hunter has found his grove and wants to continue the Defiance project with a third installment, for which he already has started to write new songs. Though the project initially emerged from expediency and COVID quarantine, Hunter evidently is encouraged by the outcomes of the collaborative approach.\n\n“I never initiated this,” he said. “It just kind of just happened and it turned out great. So I’m going to write some more songs and we’ll see what happens again.”\n\nSources: Ian Hunter website; YouTube; Spotify\n\nIt’s Saturday, which is the time of week where I take a fresh look at newly released music. All picks are included on albums that dropped yesterday (April 19).\n\nValley Lodge/Daylights\n\nValley Lodge are a power pop band from New York City who released their eponymous debut album in August 2005. Cheap Trick, T. Rex, Big Star, Raspberries, Thin Lizzy, Matthew Sweet, Slade and the Kinks are among their influences. The group’s current lineup includes Dave Hill (vocals, guitar), Phil Costello (vocals, guitar), John Kimbrough (guitar), Eddie Eyeball (bass) and Rob Pfeiffer (drums). Daylights is the fun opener of the group’s fifth and latest album Shadows in Paradise.\n\nBrainstory/Peach Optimo\n\nBrainstory are a Los Angeles-based trio whose sound AllMusic characterizes as smooth and trippy, blending psychedelic jazz and pop. Comprised of Kevin Martin (lead vocals, guitar), his brother Tony Martin (bass, vocals) and Eric Hagstrom (drums), Brainstory debuted in November 2019 with the album Buck, releasing an instrumental version and a version with vocals. They are now out with their second full-length album, Sounds Good, which pretty much sums up the music! Here’s Peach Optimo.\n\nPillow Queens/Like a Lesson\n\nIrish indie rock band Pillow Queens were formed in Dublin in 2016. Their members are Pamela Connolly (vocals, guitar), Sarah Corcoran (bass, backing vocals, pump organ), Cathy McGuinness (guitar, backing vocals) and Rachel Lyons (drums, backing vocals). After a series of singles, they released their debut album In Waiting in September 2020. Off their third and new album Name Your Sorrow, here’s Like a Lesson.\n\nThe Brother Brothers/Brown Dog\n\nNew York-based folk duo The Brother Brothers consist of Adam Moss and his identical twin brother David Moss. AllMusic notes their harmony-laden pop draws from Americana and first-generation rock & roll. Initially, Adam learned the fiddle and David picked the cello, and they played in different bands in different locations. It wasn’t until they both lived in Brooklyn that they started their duo. Their first full-length album Some People I Know appeared in October 2018. Their latest is titled The January Album. Here’s Brown Dog. Those vocal harmonies are neat!\n\nIan Hunter/People\n\nUntil February 2023 when I came across Bed of Roses by Ian Hunter from his album Defiance Part 1, I had not realized what an extensive solo career he has had since 1975. The former Mott the Hoople lead vocalist and guitarist who turns 85 in June continues to fire on all cylinders. Like last year’s predecessor, Defiance Part 2: Fiction features collaborations with prominent guests, such as the late Jeff Beck, Lucinda Williams and Chris Robinson and Rich Robinson of The Black Crowes. Here’s People featuring Cheap Trick (Tom Petersson, Robin Zander & Rick Nielsen) and Def Leppard lead vocalist Joe Elliott.\n\nPearl Jam/Running\n\nWrapping up this new music review are Pearl Jam. I’ve yet to more fully explore the Seattle rock band who were formed in 1990. Their present line-up includes co-founders Eddie Vedder (lead vocals, rhythm guitar), Mike McCready (lead guitar, backing vocals), Stone Gossard (rhythm guitar, backing vocals) and Jeff Ament (bass, keyboards, backing vocals), together with Matt Cameron (drums, percussion, backing vocals) who joined in 1998. Running, credited to the band and producer Andrew Watt, is a track from their 12th and latest album Dark Matter. This rocks nicely.\n\nSources: Wikipedia; AllMusic; Pillow Queens Bandcamp page; Ian Hunter website; YouTube; Spotify\n\nOnce again it’s Sunday and time for another installment of my weekly imaginary music time travel feature, which visits six different tracks from six different decades and in different flavors. Before getting underway, I’d like to announce a short hiatus of the blog. In a couple of hours, my family is leaving for a mini-vacation to experience the solar eclipse. I’ll resume posting and commenting on Wednesday.\n\nWayne Shorter/Blues A La Carte\n\nToday, our zig-zag excursion starts in August 1960, which saw the release of Introducing Wayne Shorter, the debut album by the jazz saxophone great as band leader. It was the first of more than 20 additional albums Wayne Shorter recorded in that role. He also played as a sideman with the likes of Art Blakey’s Jazz Messengers and Miles Davis’ Second Great Quintet. In 1970, Shorter became a co-founder of jazz fusion band Weather Report. He passed away in March 2023 at age 89. Let’s listen to the neat Shorter composition Blues A La Carte, the opener of his aforementioned debut as band leader.\n\nGianna Nannini/Latin Lover\n\nOn to Italian pop and rock singer-songwriter Gianna Nannini who enjoyed a good deal of popularity in Italy, Germany, Austria and Switzerland from the late ’70s until the mid-’80s. Including her 1976 eponymous debut, Nannini has released close to 30 albums. In 1979, she scored her first hit with America, a song off her sophomore album California. Nannini entered my radar screen in 1982 with the title track of her fifth album Latin Lover, a catchy pop rocker featuring her characteristic raspy vocals.\n\nDirty Honey/Won’t Take Me Alive\n\nLet’s jump back to the present with some sweet classic style rock by Los Angeles band Dirty Honey. Founded in 2017, they are reminiscent of groups like Aerosmith, Led Zeppelin and The Black Crowes. Dirty Honey consist of co-founders Marc Labelle (vocals), John Notto (guitar) and Justin Smolian (bass), along with Jaydon Bean who last year replaced original drummer Corey Coverstone. Off their second and most recent studio album Can’t Find the Brakes, released in November 2023, here’s Won’t Take Me Alive, credited to Notto, Smolian and Labelle. This r.o.c.k.s.!!!\n\nBig Joe Turner/Shake, Rattle and Roll\n\nTime for a dose of ’50s rock & roll! To get it we shall go back 70 years to April 1954. That’s when American blues shouter Big Joe Turner released his single Shake, Rattle and Roll, which became his second to top Billboard’s Hot R&B Singles chart. The song was written by R&B musician and songwriter Jess Stone under the pseudonym Charles Calhoun. In June of the same year, Bill Haley & His Comets released a cover of the song, scoring their second hit after Rock Around the Clock. Feel free to snip along!\n\nJanis Joplin/Cry Baby\n\nOur next stop takes us to January 1971 and the second solo album by the incredible Janis Joplin. Best known for her cover of Kris Kristofferson’s Me and Bobby McGee, the album Pearl appeared three months after her death in October 1970 at age 27. Here’s Cry Baby, another gem from that album. Co-written by Bert Berns and Jerry Ragovoy, the song was first recorded in 1963 by Garnet Mimms and the Enchanters. Joplin’s kicked up the intensity level a few notches – damn!\n\nCrash Test Dummies/Mmm Mmm Mmm Mmm\n\nAnd this brings us to our sixth and final stop. For this let’s head to April 1993 and God Shuffled His Feet, the sophomore album by Canadian alternative rock band Crash Test Dummies. Mmm Mmm Mmm Mmm became the album’s first single and the group’s biggest hit to date. It was written by lead vocalist Brad Roberts, who with his distinctive bass-baritone voice largely defines the band’s sound. The group exists to this day as a touring act.\n\nThis post wouldn’t be complete without a Spotify playlist. Hope there’s something here that tickles your fancy. See you when I’m back on Wednesday!\n\nSources: Wikipedia; YouTube; Spotify\n\nHappy Saturday and welcome to my weekly new music review. All featured picks can be found on albums that were released yesterday (March 15)\n\nBeans/Dreaming Daisy\n\nFirst up are Australian psychedelic garage rock group Beans from Melbourne. An announcement on the website of their label Fuzz Club Records notes the band is fronted by Matt Blach, drummer of rock band The Murlocs who also hail from Melbourne. Boots N Cats is Beans’ third full-length album after All Together Now (2020) and Babble (2018). Boots N Cats “bounces between organ-driven garage-rock wig-outs, breezy psych-pop and groovy funk instrumentals.” Here’s Dreaming Daisy.\n\nScott Stapp/Deadman’s Trigger\n\nScott Stapp is best known as lead vocalist and lyricist of post-grunge rockers Creed who he co-founded in Tallahassee, Fla. in 1994. After Creed had disbanded in 2004, Stapp released his first solo album, The Great Divide, in November 2005. During the hiatus of Creed who had reunited in 2009, Stapp resumed his solo career and is now out with his fourth and latest album Higher Power. Meanwhile, Creed emerged from hiatus in July 2023 and will tour the U.S. and Canada starting in April. Here’s Deadman’s Trigger co-written by Stapp, Blair Daly, Marti Frederiksen, Scott Stevens and Zac Maloy.\n\nPotato Beach/Please Waste Your Time\n\nPotato Beach are another psychedelic garage rock band, from Vienna, Austria, who were formed in 2020. From their Bandcamp profile: Anja, Peter, Sven, Lili and Jannik try to make everything sound like the 60s, even though they live in 2022. Because they are not cool enough to move to L.A., they are trying to bring the seductive sound of bands such as The Brian Jonestown Massacre, Allah-Las and La Luz to Austria. Off their first full-length album Dip In, here’s Please Waste Your Time – that cool retro grabbed me right away!\n\nCory Wells/Natural Disaster\n\nCory Wells, not to be confused with the former Three Dog Night member of the same name, is a California singer-songwriter who AllMusic notes blends acoustic EMO and cathartic power folk. Initially, Wells focused on metal and hardcore and was a touring member of post-hardcore band Movements before shifting to a quieter style and releasing his 2018 debut EP How to Tear Apart the Ones You Love. His second and latest full-length album is titled Harboring the Hurt I’ve Caused. Here’s Natural Disaster, co-written by Wells, Anton DeLost and Sarah Thompson.\n\nJames Clarke Five/Ghost\n\nJames Clarke Five is the solo project of British power pop artist James Hughes. He was a co-founder and the keyboarder of ’80s English new wave band The Cherry Boys. After their breakup in 1984, he also co-founded indie pop outfit Exhibit B whose 1988 album Playing Dead became a cult classic. Hughes launched James Clarke Five in the early 2000s. His latest album under that moniker, Zoom and The Gadflies, has “a common theme inspired by the music that excited me as a child,” Hughes explained in a statement, “people like Adam and The Ants, and also the likes of T. Rex and the ‘production style’ of the Glam Rock era.” Here’s Ghost, a song about bittersweet reflections on childhood and the passing of time with a neat harpsichord-driven sound!\n\nThe Black Crowes/Wanting and Waiting\n\nRounding out this post is music from the new album by The Black Crowes, the group’s first since their third reunion in 2019. Initially formed in Atlanta, Ga. as Mr. Crowe’s Garden in 1984, the band around brothers Chris Robinson and Rich Robinson has seen numerous line-up changes and much drama, especially between the brothers. In late 2019, they told Howard Stern they had resolved their differences. The group conducted a 2022 tour around the 30th anniversary of their Shake Your Money Maker debut album. Off their new studio project Happiness Bastards, here’s the great Wanting and Waiting. The Black Crowes are touring behind the album starting in early April.\n\nSources: Wikipedia; Fuzz Club Records website; Potato Beach Bandcamp page; AllMusic; Shameless Promotion PR press kit; YouTube; Spotify\n\nJust in time before seeing off the year, I’d like to take a final look at new music. This post highlights my six favorite albums of 2023 I reviewed.\n\nHighway 61 – Driving South\n\nAfter 30 Years and an incredible background story including the global pandemic, a near-fatal cancer episode and the death of a music mentor, Los Angeles blues rock four-piece Highway 61 released their debut album Driving South on March 24. While after their formation in the early ’90s the band managed to establish themselves on the Southern California club circuit, the record deal they sought remained elusive, and they broke up in 1993. Fast forward to the summer of 2022 when they reconvened for the first time in decades at an L.A. studio to finally record their first album. Highway 61 blend flavors of The Rolling Stones and Tom Petty with dashes of The Black Crowes and Stevie Ray Vaughan. For a little taste, here’s the kickass opener Walk On Water (full album review). Thanks again to Gregg Bell of Wanted Management, who brought Highway 61 on my radar screen!\n\nIan Hunter – Defiance Part 1\n\nIan Hunter may be an octogenarian, but he sure as heck can show all the young dudes how to rock. After his departure as lead vocalist from British glam rockers Mott the Hoople in 1974, Hunter launched a solo career and has released his own albums at a fairly steady pace. He frequently collaborated with Mick Ronson until the untimely death of David Bowie’s former sideman in 1993 at the age of 46. His 15th and latest album Defiance Part 1, recorded during COVID lockdown and released on April 21, features the late Jeff Beck, Slash, Billy Gibbons, Todd Rundgren and Ringo Starr, among others, who all added contributions at their home studios. The album also includes Hunter’s longtime collaborator Andy York, one of John Mellencamp’s guitarist, who also served as co-producer. Here’s This Is What I’m Here For, written by Hunter and featuring the late Taylor Hawkins (formerly of Foo Fighters) on drums, Waddy Wachtel (guitar) and Def Leppard’s Joe Elliott (backing vocals) (full album review).\n\nLucinda Williams – Stories From a Rock n Roll Heart\n\nLucinda Williams may be among the ultimate rock & roll survivors. Only two and a half years ago, things looked pretty bleak for the singer-songwriter, who turned 70 in January. After her East Nashville home had been damaged by a tornado in March 2020, she suffered a debilitating stroke in November of the same year. Not only did the stroke limit Williams’ physical mobility, but it also took away her ability to play guitar, the instrument she had relied on to write her songs. None of this stopped Williams. After intense rehab, she returned to the stage. Still unable to play guitar, she adjusted her way to write music, collaborated with her husband and co-producer Tom Overby and others, and recorded the incredible album Stories From a Rock n Roll Heart, which dropped on June 30. I don’t mean to romanticize hardship, but I find Williams’ strength truly inspiring. Here’s the de facto title track Rock n Roll Heart, co-written by Williams, Overby and Travis Stephens, guitarist and Williams’ road manager. The song features Bruce Springsteen and Patti Scialfa on backing vocals (full album review). Only select songs of the album are available on streaming services.\n\nCordovas – The Rose of Aces\n\nEast Nashville, Tenn.-based Americana and country rock band Cordovas have become one of my favorite contemporary groups since the summer of 2018 when I coincidentally caught them at a free open air summer concert in New Jersey. Their three-part harmony vocals and warm sound remind me of other groups like The Band, Grateful Dead, Eagles and Little Feat. Cordovas were formed in 2011 by songwriter and multi-instrumentalist Joe Firstman after he had put out a series of solo projects and served as bandleader on NBC’s former late-night TV show Last Call with Carson Daly from 2005 to 2009. On August 11, they released their fourth studio album The Rose of Aces, another gem. Here’s Love Is All It Takes, a song written by Firstman with a neat Allman Brothers Band vibe (full album review).\n\nThe Rolling Stones/Hackney Diamonds\n\nHackney Diamonds is no Sticky Fingers or Exile On Main St., but the first new Rolling Stones album with original music in 18 years still marks a late-stage career highlight. Released on October 20, Hackney Diamonds sounds remarkably fresh and dynamic for a band that has existed for 61 years! The first Stones album since the 2021 death of longtime drummer Charlie Watts features Elton John, Lady Gaga, Stevie Wonder, Bill Wyman, Paul McCartney and even Watts, among others. One of the most effective contributions are Lady Gaga’s backing vocals on Sweet Sounds of Heaven, a great soulful ballad credited to Mick Jagger and Keith Richards. It also includes Wonder on keyboards and piano, but you don’t notice unless you carefully listen to Jagger telling Wonder, ‘Play me something, Steve’, at around the 5:30-minute mark or check the credits – a relatively small wrinkle on what I think is the Stones’ best studio album since 1989’s Steel Wheels (full album review).\n\nRaze Regal & White Denim Inc. – Raze Regal & White Denim Inc.\n\nThe collaboration between Raze Regal, who AllMusic calls an eclectic, psych, jazz, and rock-influenced guitarist, and James Petralli, vocalist of Austin, Texas indie rock band White Denim who he co-founded in 2006, is one of my most intriguing new music discoveries this year. The album’s sophisticated sound blending jazz, rock, soul and pop at times reminds me of Steely Dan and some of Gino Vannelli’s work I’ve heard. Here’s the cool opener Ashley Goudeau, named after a local Austin morning news anchor, a song about a parasocial relationship with a TV personality (full album review).\n\nSources: Wikipedia; AllMusic; YouTube; Spotify\n\nHappy Wednesday and I’d like to welcome you to another installment of my recurring feature where I’m taking a deeper dive into a tune I’ve only briefly mentioned or not covered at all to date. Today, I decided to go ’70s classic rock, coz why not! If you celebrated the Fourth of July last evening and feel your morning coffee hasn’t quite done the trick to get you going at full throttle, I think I might have a good remedy: Back in the Saddle by Aerosmith!\n\nCo-written by the Boston rockers’ Steven Tyler and Joe Perry, also lovingly known as The Toxic Twins, Back in the Saddle first appeared in May 1976 on the group’s fourth studio album aptly titled Rocks. The opener also became the LP’s third and final single in March 1977.\n\nThe tune that after a short guitar intro starts with Tyler screaming I’m baaaaack, I’m back in the saddle again, didn’t exactly refer to smashing chart success, something that’s also sadly true for many other great Aerosmith tunes. It climbed to no. 38 in the U.S. on the Billboard Hot 100 and a meager no. 68 in Canada.\n\nRocks, on the other hand, fared much better. How much? How about no. 3 on the Billboard 200, the group’s highest-charting album in the U.S. at the time, and no. 14 in Canada. That’s more like it! Rocks also charted in Australia (no. 45) and Sweden (no. 46). On the sales front, it reached 4X Platinum status (4 million certified copies) in the U.S. and Platinum certification in Canada (100,000 certified units) by July 1976 and November 1976, respectively.\n\nPerry wrote the song’s main riff on a Fender Bass VI, creating the tune’s distinctive growl. The lead guitar part was performed by Brad Whitford who is otherwise mainly known as the band’s rhythm guitarist. Tom Hamilton delivered what is considered one of his heaviest and most noticeable bass lines, while Joey Kramer was manning the skins.\n\nAccording to Wikipedia, Back in the Saddle features some interesting sound effects of a galloping horse and whips, and screams and even yodeling by Steven Tyler at the end of the song. Apparently, at first, they tried using a real bullwhip, but I guess drugs and bullwhips don’t mix too well, and after some self-inflected injuries, the boys ingeniously figured out to create the whip effects by “whirling a 30-foot cord from the studio, then by firing a cap gun to create the crack of the whip.” You just can’t make this stuff up!\n\nWhile at the time Tyler wrote the lyrics he had cowboys and sex on his mind [sex and rock & roll? Unheard of! CMM], Back in the Saddle took on new meaning when Aerosmith named their 1984 reunion tour after it. Perry and Whitford had departed the band in 1979 and 1981, respectively, leaving Aerosmith on the rocks! It’s your typical rock & roll BS drama and, as such, not worthwhile getting into it any further.\n\nBTW, speaking of tours, Aerosmith are set to embark on getting back in the saddle one last time in early September. In an over-the-top video clip teasing the Peace Out tour Tyler emphasizes, “And if you think we’re joking, dream on!” Clever! The Black Crowes will be part of the final hurray. Admittedly, my sweet emotions about the band I’ve never seen make me feel I don’t want to miss a thing. You see, I may not be a rock star, but I can do clever as well! Here’s the schedule.\n\nFollowing are additional insights from Songfacts:\n\nThis song describes a cowboy going to a bar, picking up a girl and spending the night with her. There is lots of sexual innuendo in the lyrics among the Old West images (“I’m like a loaded gun,” “This snake is gonna rattle).\n\nThe prostitute in the song, Sukie Jones, was a creation of Steven Tyler and not a real person. One fan of the song is original Guns N’ Roses drummer Steven Adler, who in 2003 formed a band called Suki Jones, which he later renamed Adler’s Appetite.\n\n“Back In The Saddle Again” was a song popularized by Gene Autry, who first recorded it in 1939. Autry was known as “The Singing Cowboy,” and his song played up the cowboy persona he portrayed in movies and TV specials. [Other than the title, the two tunes are unrelated – CMM]\n\nSteven Tyler decided to use the cowboy theme for his lyrics after talking with producer Jack Douglas about using the “back in the saddle” line as a way of declaring that the band was back with a new album and ready to rock hard. Tyler always thought “back in saddle” meant having sex with your girlfriend more than once in a night, so he wrote the lyrics about a cowboy riding into town to satisfy his sexual urges. He wrote the lyrics in the stairwell of the Record Plant recording studio, where he would often write once the track was finished.\n\nThe main riff was composed by guitarist Joe Perry on a 6-string bass guitar he had recently purchased. Perry says he was “lying on the floor, stoned on heroin” when he came up with the riff. The song wasn’t recorded until almost a year later, when they used their rehearsal space – a warehouse in Waltham, Massachusetts they called “The Wherehouse” – as a recording studio by bringing in a mobile recording unit to record the Rocks album.\n\n…After the band put the track together around Joe Perry’s guitar riff, they knew it would be a great opener for the album. Producer Jack Douglas said in the Aerosmith biography Walk This Way: “We recorded ‘Back In The Saddle’ to have this larger-than-life vibe, to bring the band right into the middle of the kid’s head when he put on his ‘phones in his bedroom late at night.”\n\nFor the bridge, lead singer Steven Tyler taped tambourines to his cowboy boots and stomped on a piece of plywood he laid down in the studio. For the crack of the whip, they bought a bullwhip, but nobody could use it. They ended up faking the whip sound by having Tyler swing a cord in a studio to make the whirling noise, then using a cap gun for the crack.\n\nThis is one of the first rock songs with a cowboy theme, complete with the sound of a horse. Other songs that take us back to the Old West include “Desperado” by the Eagles and “Wanted Dead Or Alive” by Bon Jovi [one of my favorite songs by the Jersey rockers who oftentimes draw mixed reactions among rock fans – CMM].\n\nSebastian Bach recorded this with Axl Rose for Bach’s 2007 album Angel Down, his first album since his 2001 release Bach 2: Basics. In an interview with the Hartford, Connecticut radio station WCCC, Bach explained that his producer Roy Z convinced him to record the song as a way to announce his return, since “Bach was Back In The Saddle.”\n\nI guess Bach passed the audition.\n\nSources: Wikipedia; Songfacts; RIAA website; Music Canada website; YouTube\n\nWelcome to the first Sunday Six of this summer, which officially started on Wednesday. It was also the longest day and shortest night in the Northern Hemisphere. I hope you’re up for another trip to visit some great music of the past and the present. The magical music time machine is ready to take off, so grab a seat and fasten your seatbelt while I set the controls for our first stop. And off we go!\n\nMiles Davis/I Fall In Love Too Easily\n\nToday, we start our journey in July 1963 and Seven Steps to Heaven, a studio album by Miles Davis. During his five-decade career, the trumpeter, bandleader and composer was at the forefront of many major stylistic developments in jazz, making him one of the most influential and acclaimed music artists of the 20th century. On Seven Steps to Heaven, Davis worked with Herbie Hancock (piano), Ron Carter (bass) and Tony Williams (drums), who became his regular sidemen for the next five years. I Fall In Love Too Easily, composed in 1944 by English-American songwriter Jule Styne, featured Davis, George Coleman (tenor saxophone), Victor Feldman (piano), Carter and Frank Butler (drums).\n\nDirty Honey/Heartbreaker 2.0\n\nOur next stop takes us back to the present and a cool classic rock-oriented band I first came across in April 2021. Dirty Honey, founded in 2017 in Los Angeles, have a sound reminiscent of groups like Aerosmith, Led Zeppelin and The Black Crowes. Heartbreaker 2.0, their most recent single released in January this year, is an updated version of Heartbreaker, a tune that first appeared on their eponymous debut EP, which came out in March 2019. This song nicely rocks and I look forward to more music by these guys!\n\nBo Diddley/Who Do You Love?\n\nThe beauty of the magical music time machine is it can take us to any year of any decade in an instant. So, how about the ’50s? Sure! Let’s go to 1956 and the man who became famous for playing rectangular electric guitars and a seductive signature beat: Bo Diddley, who played was instrumental in the transition from the blues to rock & roll, and influenced many artists, such as Buddy Holly, Elvis Presley, The Rolling Stones, The Animals and George Thorogood. Here’s Diddley’s classic Who Do You Love? written by him and first released as a single in 1956. Featuring his signature Bo Diddley Beat, the tune was also included on his eponymous debut album, which came out in 1958.\n\nDavid Bowie/Life On Mars?\n\nSince I saw a great David Bowie tribute band on Tuesday, the English singer-songwriter and actor has been on my mind. I’m particularly drawn to Bowie’s early phase. This particular pick leads us to December 1971, which saw the release of his 4th studio album Hunky Dory. Bowie was clearly intrigued with space exploration, as evidenced by tunes like Space Oddity, Starman and Life On Mars? Hunky Dory introduced Bowie’s new core backing band of Mick Ronson (guitar), Trevor Bolder (bass) and Mick Woodmansey (drums), who would soon become The Spiders from Mars. The piano part on Life On Mars? was played by Rick Wakeman, then a session musician and soon-to-be member of Yes.\n\nThird Eye Blind/Semi-Charmed Life\n\nNext, let’s pay a visit to the ’90s with a catchy tune I well remember hearing on the radio: Semi-Charmed Life by alternative rock band Third Eye Blind. The tune first appeared in February 1997 as the lead single of their eponymous debut album, which was released in April of the same year. Solely credited to frontman Stephan Jenkins (lead vocals, guitar, keyboards), Semi-Charmed Life became their most successful single. Third Eye Blind were formed in San Francisco in 1993 and are still around, with Jenkins remaining as the only original member.\n\nScorpions/Rock You Like a Hurricane\n\nOnce again, the time has come to wrap up another musical excursion. For our final stop, let’s go out with a bang by German pop metal rockers Scorpions and Rock You Like a Hurricane. The tune was included on their ninth studio album Love At First Sting, which solidified the band’s international popularity and became their biggest seller. Scorpions were formed in Hanover in 1965 by Rudolf Schenker (rhythm guitar, backing vocals) who remains with the group to this day, as are two members who were part of the line-up that recorded the album: Klaus Meine (lead vocals) and Matthias Jabs (lead guitar, backing vocals). Scorpions are currently touring in Europe. I still love that guitar riff and Meine is a killer vocalist. And don’t you love his German accent? 🙂\n\nThis post wouldn’t be complete without a Spotify playlist of the above-featured tracks. Hope there’s something you dig and that you’ll join me again next Sunday for another trip!\n\nSources: Wikipedia; Scorpions website; YouTube; Spotify\n\nHappy Saturday and, if you’re living in the U.S., Happy Memorial Day weekend, and hopefully a three-day stretch off work. It’s that time of the week again when I take a fresh look at newly released music. All featured tracks are on albums that dropped yesterday (May 26), except for the final pick (May 25).\n\nLes Lullies/Mauvaise Foi\n\nWhen I came across new music by French rock band Les Lullies, I was quite excited, since this may be my first time featuring a French language song. Then I thought their name somehow sounded familiar. Surely enough, fellow blogger Angie Moon from The Diversity of Classic Rock recently featured a Q&A with the group from Montpellier, who have been around since 2016. Their Bandcamp page notes those four cheese eating attack monkeys are here to kick your ass. Raw, simple, straight rock’n’roll music. How about some proof? Here’s Mauvaise Foi (bad faith), the title track of their second and latest album. There’s a nice punk rawness in their tunes.\n\nAJJ/Candles of Love\n\nAJJ are a folk punk band from Phoenix, AZ, formed in 2004 as Andrew Jackson Jihad by Sean Bonnette (lead vocals, rhythm guitar) and Ben Gallaty (bass, backing vocals) who remain their core members. Since their 2005 debut Candy Cigarettes & Cap Guns, AJJ, among others, have released seven additional studio albums including their latest Disposable Everything. Here’s the mellow-sounding Candles of Love, credited to all five members of the band and producer David Jerkovich\n\nJoe Perry/Fortunate One (feat. Chris Robinson)\n\nMy next pick comes from the seventh studio album by Joe Perry, who of course is best known as a co-founder and the lead guitarist of longtime Boston rockers Aerosmith. Sweetzerland Manifesto MKII combines different versions of four tracks that first appeared on Perry’s previous solo effort Sweetzerland Manifesto with six all-new tracks, noted Ultimate Classic Rock. Among the latter is the great opener Fortunate One featuring Chris Robinson of The Black Crowes on lead vocals and Stone Temple Pilots’ bassist Robert DeLeo. The Black Crowes will join Aerosmith on what is billed as the Boston band’s Peace Out farewell tour that kicks off in September.\n\nRadiator Hospital/Sweet Punisher\n\nWrapping up this week’s new music review are Radiator Hospital, a Philly-based group around power pop and pop punk-oriented songwriter Sam Cook-Parrott (vocals, guitar). According to their AllMusic bio, Cook-Parrott started Radiator Hospital after his graduation from high school. To date, seven Radiator Hospital albums in different formats have been issued. From their latest, Can’t Make Any Promise, which came out on May 25, here’s Sweet Punisher, penned by Cook-Parrott.\n\nOf course, this post wouldn’t be complete without a Spotify playlist featuring the above and a few additional tracks.\n\nSources: Wikipedia; Ultimate Classic Rock; AllMusic; YouTube; Spotify"
