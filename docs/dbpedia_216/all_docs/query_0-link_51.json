        "text": "Reckless Records 4/5 New Releases\n\nJORDANA & TV GIRL – Summer’s Over EP (Grand Jury)\n\nFantastic EP from two great newer bands JORDANA & TV GIRL. Lo-fi pop with TV GIRL’s sampling style mostly leading the way. Sort of like a mix of early BECK & Phoebe Bridgers if you can imagine that with some dream pop elements.\n\nMOUNT KIMBIE – The Sunset Violent LP/CD (Warp) black or orange vinyl\n\nLondon electronica duo MOUNT KIMBIE follow up their 2-in-1 split LP “Die Cuts / City Planning” with a collaborative album that leans more into the post-punk side of their sound reminiscent of KING KRULE (who happens to feature on two tracks here).\n\nVARIOUS ARTISTS – Congo Funk! Sound Madness From the Shores of the Mighty Congo River, Kinshasa / Brazzaville 1969-1982 LP/CD (Analog Africa)\n\nThe 38th Analog Africa compilation focuses on Central Africa, in particular the twin cities of Kinshasa and Brazzaville sitting on opposite sides of the Congo River. Influenced by the American funk & psych music of the era – a JAMES BROWN performance preceding the historic Ali/Foreman “Rumble in the Jungle” in 1974 made huge waves – Congolese musicians adopted electric guitars and transformed the elliptical, cycling rumba into their own hybrid funk, while launching a fleet of independent record labels. Fantastic stuff that comes HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!\n\nVARIOUS ARTISTS – Triangulos De Luz Y Espacios De Sombra LP (Seance Centre)\n\nThe excellent Seance Center label has put together a really cool compilation of Mexican experimental,electronic music taken from rare cassettes, private pressings & previously unreleased sources. The title is taken from a public access TV show which translates to “Triangles of Light and Spaces of Shadow” in English. These recordings provide really cool insight into Mexican electronic music of the mid 80s-90s. Fans of the Music From Memorycomps should take note. RECOMMENDED.\n\nOTHER IMPORTANT NEW RELEASES & RESTOCKS\n\nANIMAL COLLECTIVE – Prospect Hummer EP (Domino) reissue\n\nBLACK KEYS – Ohio Players LP/CD (Easy Eye Sound) limited red or black vinyl\n\nMARTIN CARTHY – Martin Carthy LP (Topic) reissue\n\nFIELDS OF THE NEPHILIM – Elizium LP (Beggars Banquet) remastered, expanded edition on red vinyl\n\nCONAN GRAY – Found In Heaven LP\n\nIRON MONKEY – Spleen & Goad LP (Relapse)\n\nJOKERS WILD – Step Outside Your Mind LP (Sundazed)\n\nKHRUANGBIN – A La Sala LP/CD (Dead Oceans) color vinyl\n\nTHE KVB – Tremors LP (Invada) red vinyl\n\nLAFAYETTE AFRO-ROCK BAND – Malik LP (Strut) reissue\n\nLAFAYETTE AFRO-ROCK BAND – Soul Makossa LP (Strut) reissue\n\nLAUFEY – Bewitched LP (Awal) finally back in stock\n\nLIBERTINES – All Quiet on the Eastern Esplanade LP (EMI) clear or white vinyl\n\nLIL DICKY – Penith: The Dave Soundtrack LP (BMG)\n\nMAGGOT BRAIN #16 magazine (Third Man)\n\nNO DOUBT – Singles 1992- 2003 LP (Interscope)\n\nPALACE – Ultrasound LP (Fiction) color or black vinyl\n\nFABIANA PALLADINO – Fabiana Palladino LP (Paul Institute) Wicker Park only more in stock next week\n\nPERNICE BROTHERS – Who Will You Believe? LP (New West) clear vinyl, autographed almost sold out\n\nPHOSPHORESCENT – Revelator LP/CD (Verve) indie only color or black\n\nKATIE PRUITT – Matras LP (Rounder)\n\nSINKANE – We Belong LP (City Slang) purple vinyl\n\nELLIOTT SMITH – Either/Or: Expanded Edition LP (Kill Rock Stars) back in stock on maroon vinyl!\n\nSOUL GLO – Songs to Yeet at the Sun LP (Secret Voice)\n\nTOSCA – No Hassle LP (!K7) 15th anniversary deluxe edition\n\nVAMPIRE WEEKEND – Only God Was Above Us LP/CD (Columbia) indie LP with alternate cover, black vinyl is sold out\n\nin Wicker Park already. More next week\n\nJANE WEAVER – Love in Constant Spectacle LP (Fire)\n\nReckless Records 3/22 & 3/29 New Releases\n\nWe were short-staffed last week so we’re combining last week’s list with this one. There’s tons of good stuff at all locations right now\n\nANDRE 3000 – New Blue Sun LP/CD (Epic)\n\nIt’s finally here folks, the record that’s brought about as much attention to the flute recently as Lizzo, Andre 3000’s meditative “New Blue Sun.” Produced alongside the great Carlos Nino, Andre has created something truly special here that we hope will prove any possible skeptics wrong. At nearly 90 minutes, this is a deep & heady listen. A record that sits somewhere between 60s/70s spiritual jazz by greats like Pharoah Sanders & Roland Kirk, 80s new age lala the legendary Laraaji & even Japanese video game music. Andre is no flute shredder, his playing is pretty straight-ahead & almost rudimentary but the spirit behind this feels as pure as can be.RECOMMENDED.\n\nBIG BOYS – Lullabies Help the Brain Grow LP (Touch & Go) color vinyl, ltd. to 1000\n\nBIG BOYS – No Matter How Long the Line At the Cafeteria, There’s Always a Seat! LP (Touch & Go) color vinyl, ltd. to 1000\n\nBIG BOYS – Where’s My Towel/ Industry Standard LP (Touch & Go) color vinyl, ltd. to 1000\n\n2024 color vinyl reissues of the albums by the legendary Austin genre-bending punks BIG BOYS. Similar to bands like THE MINUTEMEN, BAD BRAINS & some GOVERNMENT ISSUE, BIG BOYS weren’t afraid to stray from punk, sometimes playing with funk & rhythmic post-punk in ways that most bands weren’t brave enough to attempt at the time. We’re so glad to be able to carry these amazing records once again. Limited to 1000 copies via Touch & Go. RECOMMENDED.\n\nCHASTITY BELT – Live Laugh Love LP (Suicide Squeeze)\n\nThe talented Seattle quartet CHASTITY BELT returns with a new one in 2024. No surprise here that the songs are great, straight-ahead guitar tunes with mellow hooks. Think 80s stuff like THROWING MUSES, SCRAWL, FELT, THE FEELIES & more recent stuff like Chicago’s own LALA LALA. RECOMMENDED.\n\nCIVEROUS – Maze Envy LP/CD (20 Buck Spin) color or black vinyl\n\nThe Los Angeles death metal unit CIVEROUS returns in 2024 with “Maze Envy.” The album begins with a screeching Bernard Herrmann esque string passage & quickly devolves into cavernous, doom-laden death metal. There are technical elements that will appeal to fans of BLOOD INCANTATION & some clean guitar passages that remind us of DREAM UNENDING. Overall pretty cool stuff here.\n\nALICE COLTRANE – TheCarnegie Hall Concert LP/CD (Impulse)\n\nWow! This multitrack recording of a 1971 concert at Carnegie Hall was originally planned as an Impulse release but never came out for reasons unknown. This fantastic sounding recording features an absolutely bonkers group of superstars including Pharoah Sanders, Archie Shepp, Jimmy Garrison, Cecil McBee, Ed Blackwell, Tulsi & Kumar Kramer. A true holy grail for Alice Coltrane fans. RECOMMENDED OF COURSE!\n\nADRIANNE LENKER – Bright Future LP/CD (4AD) indie only recycled vinyl or regular\n\nFollowing BIG THIEF’s sprawling double-LP opus “Dragon New Warm Mountain I Believe in You”, singer ADRIANNE LENKER simplifies with this solo full-length. Just in the same way as her “Songs” & “Instrumentals” release in 2020, LENKER recorded these songs directly to tape,mostly with guitar, piano and violin, giving “Bright Future” the feeling of an impromptu home session done by musicians who have lived long enough in these songs to play them loosely. LENKER’s writing evokes both sunlit Americana and airy, dreamlike psych-folk, all rooted in her skills for intuitive melody and poignant couplet lyricism. HIGHLY HIGHLY RECOMMENDED\n\nMAJESTY CRUSH – Butterflies Don’t Go Away LP (Numero) limited color or black\n\nNumero turns their attention to the 90s Detroit shoegaze/dream pop band MAJESTY CRUSH. The band was popular in their hometown but for some reason they never really took off in other places. If you’re a fan of 90s stuff like early RIDE, SWERVEDRIVER & CATHERINE WHEEL you should check this stuff out. RECOMMENDED.\n\nSOYUZ – II LP (Mr. Bongo) gold or black vinyl\n\nMr. Bongo reissue of this fantastic 2019 album by SOYUZ. Based in Minsk, SOYUZ write mellow psychedelic rock tunes with nods at music from around the world including 60’s Brazilian music, Turkish & Peruvian psych rock & nods at contemporary artists like DUNGEN & KHRUANGBIN. If you’re into any of that stuff you should really check this out. RECOMMENDED.\n\nOTHER IMPORTANT NEW RELEASES & RESTOCKS\n\nAESOP ROCK – Daylight EP (Rhymesayers)\n\nALICE IN CHAINS – Jar of Flies LP (Columbia) finally available again. Belmont & Milwaukee Ave are sold out but they’ll have more next week\n\nAPPARITION – Disgraced Emmantions From a Tranquil State LP/CD (Profound Lore)\n\nSCOTT H.

It’s a Blistering set of molten soundscapes crafted from SoundCloud trap beats, blown-out bass, immersive waves of distortion, and Kim’s iconic NYC drawl – imagine a classic Youth jam like “Kool Thing” if it were dipped in lava, fossilized and then Electrified by lightning. There are nods to her heroes in SUICIDE & THROBBING GRISTLE, old peers ROYAL TRUX & MBV, artists like M.I.A. & SLEIGH BELLS who were inspired by SY, and some genuinely left-field influences like DEATH GRIPS, CHARLI XCX & even PLAYBOI CARTI, if you can Believe it. This is Yet again a truly Essential release from one of the coolest to ever do it. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!\n\n>> TOMATO FLOWER – No LP (Ramp Local) *Indie Exclusive Multi-Color Vinyl\n\nBaltimore’s TOMATO FLOWER releases their full length debut, a textured, deftly played mix of psych-pop, folk and emo. Little touches of ANIMAL COLLECTIVE, some PALM mathyness, and heart-on-your-sleeve CLOUD NOTHINGS guitar rock. RECOMMENDED!\n\n>> TORREY – Torrey LP (Slumberland) *White Vinyl\n\nSecond album (and first on Slumberland) for Bay Area dream pop/ shoegaze outfit TORREY, putting together guitar-driven, melody-forward pop compositions that strike a balance between 90s alt-rock (think LUSH, DROP NINETEENS) and brighter, more contemporary indie (ALVVAYS, a little JAPANESE BREAKFAST). RECOMMENDED!\n\nOTHER NEW RELEASES, REISSUES & RESTOCKS:\n\n>> ERIKA ANGELL – The Obsession With Her Voice LP (Constellation)\n\nAPHEX TWIN – I Care Because You Do 2LP (Warp) *Reissue – Back in stock!\n\nAPHEX TWIN – Richard D.

Similar to another Boston band at the time, THE SWIRLIES, DROP NINETEENS took the Brit-Pop/shoegaze sound of bands like SLOWDIVE, MY BLOODY VALENTINE & CATHERINE WHEEL and added their own twist to it. Their debut album has been impossible to find for years & we’re really excited to be able to carry it once again. RECOMMENDED!\n\n>> RUTH GOLLER – SKYLLUMINA LP/CD (International Anthem)\n\nLondon based composer & bassist RUTH GOLLER has worked a lot with Int’l Anthem mainstays ALABASTER DePLUME and BEX BURCH, and her solo work embraces the open improvization of her comrades with ethereal pop vocals that remind us a bit of ANA ROXANNE. Features support from BURCH and THE SMILE’s Tom Skinner. RECOMMENDED!\n\n>> JAHARI MASSAMBA UNIT – YHWH is LOVE LP (Law Of Rhythm) *KARRIEM RIGGINS and MADLIB\n\nThe duo of MADLIB and KARRIEM RIGGINS return as JAHARI MASSAMBA UNIT for a record that blends spiritual jazz, rare groove and instrumental hip-hop. While the other instruments are handled by MADLIB, it’s RIGGINS on the drums that stays front and center, at once nimble and powerful, all recorded to perfection. Fans of MADLIB’s jazz project YESTERDAYS NEW QUINTET as well as Int’l Anthem artists like MAKAYA McCRAVEN and JUNIUS PAUL will find a lot to love here. RECOMMENDED!\n\n>> VARIOUS – Disco Not Disco 3LP (Strut) *25th Anniversary – Yellow Vinyl\n\nAn absolutely essential disco compilation gets a much needed anniversary version. Disco Not Disco collects some of the best leftfield disco and early dance cuts from the post-Studio 54 era in downtown Manhattan.

Her sonic palatte is rooted in world of dance music, and these tracks end up as skillful forays into trip-hop, drum’n’bass and hip-house. But at the forefront is DE CASIER’s voice, never aggressive but always expressive in wrapping tight, hooky melodies around these beats. ABSOLUTELY RECOMMENDED.\n\n>> HURRAY FOR THE RIFF RAFF – The Past is Still Alive LP/CD (Nonesuch) *Translucent “Orange Crush” Vinyl\n\nAfter some thrilling detours into other genres on the defiantly radical Life on Earth, Alynda Segarra returns to their vintage roots-rock sound for this latest entry under the HURRAY FOR THE RIFF RAFF banner. Alynda sounds laser-focused after a few years in the wilderness, their voice clear as a bell over chiming guitars and crisp drums. This is powerful folk music of the first order, informed by struggle and pulsing with life. Deftly produced by Brad Cook (WAXAHATCHEE, BON IVER) and featuring CONOR OBERST, HAND HABITS’ Meg Duffy, ANJIMILE and SG GOODMAN. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!\n\n>> MGMT – Loss of Life LP/CD (Mom + Pop) *Black or Indie Exclusive “Blue Jay” Vinyl\n\nThe mighty psych-pop duo MGMT return for their fifth studio album, and Loss of Life (“lol?”) is a little harder to pin down compared to the icy synths of their previous effort Little Dark Age or the technicolor party rock of their debut Oracular Spectacular. The sonic influence here ranges from vintage chillwave to stuffed-up 70s glam to synth punk with a collage-like pace. Great, energetic stuff from a band that’s been going at it for nearly twenty years. RECOMMENDED!\n\n>> MARY TIMONY – Untame the Tiger LP/CD (Merge) *Black or Peak Vinyl Edition Neon Pink Vinyl\n\nFor her first solo album in 15 years (after stints with the supergroup WILD FLAG and fronting the kickass power trio EX HEX), ex-HELIUM singer/songwriter/axe wielder MARY TIMONY looks inward for a set of intricate, tightly wound folk-rock tunes. It trades in her vintage face-melting riffage & wild energy for a different kind of rawness, fresh as an open wound. Fans of RICHARD & LINDA THOMPSON and FAIRPORT CONVENTION (whose drummer Dave Mattacks very coolly guests here) will absolutely adore this record. RECOMMENDED!\n\n>> NEIL YOUNG – Dume 2LP (Reprise) *Indie Exclusive Ltd. Edition w/ art print & lyric poster\n\nDume was originally released as part of the Archives Vol. II box set in 2020. The title comes from Pointe Dume, a promontory off the coast of Malibu where Neil & CRAZY HORSE wrote & recorded the songs. The sessions would be whittled down to form Zuma, one of Neil & the band’s greatest achievements. Now expanded with outtakes & alternate mixes, Dume is a new look at the Zuma era with 7 songs that have never been on vinyl before. This is as good as these Archives releases get in our opinion.

CHIU made a stop into the Vintage Synthesizer Museum in Highland Park, LA, with an open-ended plan to record, and over the course of two days built, programmed and sequenced the pieces that would become this record. The result is a great display of intuitive songwriting, ranging from RAYMOND SCOTT-like vintage miniatures to grand kosmiche in the mold of HARMONIA. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!\n\n>> CODEINE/ BEDHEAD – Atmosphere b/w Disorder 7″ (Numero Group) *Color or “Ozone Blue” Vinyl\n\nTwo of the legit first-wave slow core bands team up for a split 7″ with both bands covering two of your favorite JOY DIVISION songs. Hook it into our veins… RECOMMENDED!\n\n>> LAURA JANE GRACE – Hole in My Head LP/CD/CS (Polyvinyl) *Hot Pink Vinyl ✶ ✶ ✶ ✶\n\nThe mighty LJG is back at it with another record in what’s shaping up to be a fruitful solo discography. It continues the trend started on her pandemic-era releases of paring down the trademark AGAINST ME bombast to its bare essentials, resulting in really sharp lo-fi punk & folk (& even rockabilly & country) tracks that are as raw and bracingly immediate as any she’s ever made. Chicago’s gonna miss you, Laura! HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!\n\n>> IDLES – Tangk LP/CD (Partisan) *Black, Indie Exclusive Translucent Pink Vinyl, or Deluxe Edition Ltd. Yellow Vinyl w/ holographic sleeve & book\n\nBristol’s IDLES enlist the help of RADIOHEAD producer Nigel Godrich (as well as KENNY BEATS and James Murphy of LCD SOUNDSYSTEM) for a record that expands out of punk onto the dancefloor while still retaining the group’s signature cockney aggression. On Partisan and RECOMMENDED!\n\n>> CHELSEA WOLFE – She Reaches Out to She Reaches Out to She LP/CD (Loma Vista) *Black or Indie Exclusive Transparent Blue Vinyl\n\nLongtime Reckless fave CHELSEA WOLFE returns with her 1st solo album in almost 5 years (though she’s devoted time to great side projects with CONVERGE and MRS. PISS and scoring the film X). This new joint is produced by DAVE SITEK, who draws out the industrial, electro, and trip-hop influences that have always creeped at the edges of Chelsea’s music. The chilly electronics & buzzing rhythms marry extremely well with Chelsea’s voice, as lush & powerful as ever.

Finally, one of the greatest heavy progressive albums of ALL TIME (yes, that’s right) has been OFFICIALLY reissued by Seelie Court. This major slab features the heavy psychedelic guitar work of the legendary MARTIN WEAVER (ex-WICKED LADY), guitarist/vocalist STEVE GILES, bassist RON JOHNSON and drummer CLIVE THORNEYCROFT. This is a fantastic psychedelic boogie album with a sinister bent and a wicked sense of humor. We couldn’t be more overjoyed that this album can be heard again. GET IT WHILE YOU CAN! HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!\n\n>> DUCKS LTD. – Harm’s Way LP (Carpark) *Ltd. Color Vinyl\n\nDUCKS LTD. – a Toronto-based duo with roots in the Australia, UK, and Midwest music scenes – are back with this follow-up to their assured 2021 debut LP. On Harm’s Way they nail the classic CARS/STROKES trick of making every instrument part a hook – each chiming riff, bassline, drum fill, and rich vocal harmony are pure, sticky ear candy. And like all the best jangle/power pop, repeated listens reveal layers of aching melancholy beneath the sugary surface. PLUS, awesomely, this record was made in Chicago and features members of RATBOYS, DEHD, FINOM and MOONTYPE. Really good stuff – HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!\n\n>> BRITTANY HOWARD – What Now LP (Island) *Translucent Yellow Vinyl\n\nBRITTANY HOWARD returns with her second solo LP removed from ALABAMA SHAKES. For What Now, she taps into the same wells of influence that BEYONCÉ did for Renaissance – glitchy funk, warm R&B, and euphoric house – for a set of songs equally as resilient. Throughout she proves her bonafides not just as a powerhouse singer but also as a truly incredible guitarist – one of our best living, no doubt about it. This is just one more brilliant release from an artist who is building up an absolutely towering body of work… HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!\n\n>> HELADO NEGRO – Phasor LP/CD (4AD)\n\nRoberto Carlos Lange follows up his expansive double LP Far In with a tighter collection of songs that draw influence from atmospheric kosmiche ambience (a direct reference to PAULINE OLIVEROS in the album’s opener) and tight, prominent grooves. For fans of SAULT, CATE LE BON & even STEREOLAB. RECOMMENDED!\n\n>> DAVID NANCE & MOWED SOUND – David Nance & Mowed Sound LP (Third Man) *Black or Color Vinyl\n\nHighly prolific journeyman songwriter/guitarist DAVID NANCE has banded together a Crazy Horse of his own in MOWED SOUND for this S/T’d “debut” LP, his first on JACK WHITE’s Third Man Records. Together they conjure up a set full of freewheeling boogie, cosmic Americana & greased-up psych with motorik grooves that throb & pulse hypnotically, evoking ghosts of Afrobeat, raga & CAN as much as classic ZZ TOP or ALLMAN BROS. A thrilling listen that will make you wanna trade in your wings on some wheels, hit the pavement & find some desert to go flying by… RECOMMENDED!\n\n>> STEVE ROACH – Structures From Silence LP (Projekt) *2024 Remaster – Color Vinyl\n\nMuch appreciated reissue of this ambient/new age classic by Steve Roach. Originally released in 1984, this album is now regarded as one of the most important releases in the ambient genre & it sounds incredibly modern today as many artists now are exploring similar territory that Roach did over 30 years ago. ENO, VANGELIS & SCHULZE are solid comparisons but Roach was pushing his synth textures into a realm that still sounds fresh. Fans of the previously mentioned ambient giants as well as contemporaries like ONEOHTRIX POINT NEVER & Steve Hauschildt will want to check this out. RECOMMENDED!\n\n>> SONIC YOUTH – Walls Have Ears LP/CD (Goofin’) *Black or Ltd. Silver Vinyl\n\nWalls Have Ears was originally released as an artist sanctioned “unofficial” release in 1986 & has been highly sought after ever since. The legendary LP featured material taken from 3 UK shows spliced together with sound collage & experimental sections that set it above your typical bootleg release. The lo-fi recordings really put you in the room with the band & the Bad Moon Rising heavy tracklist mixed with in-process/pre Evol tunes hits about as hard as you’d hope.

Color Vinyl\n\nSophomore release from DEL THE FUNKY HOMOSAPIEN, & 30 years later it’s become a classic. Del’s first LP was put together with some help from his cousin, ICE CUBE & it should be no surprise to listeners that this second record, produced primarily by Hiero crew members Domino, A-Plus, Casual & Del himself, is a bit Jazzier & less G-Funky. Del’s got a great ear, a great pen, & an incredible voice, & if you don’t have a copy of this recOrd, you should grab this anniversary release before it’s too late. Promise you it’s worth it. RECOMMENDED!\n\n>> ARIEL KALMA, JEREMIAH CHIU & MARTA SOFIA HONER – The Closest Thing to Silence LP/CD (International Anthem)\n\nThis collaboration between French-Australian new age luminary ARIEL KALMA and Int’l Anthem experimentalists JEREMIAH CHIU and MARTA SOFIA HONER was born at first from a meeting on BBC Radio’s “Late Junction” series, where the trio would exchange and work on fragments of each other’s original music. The initial twenty minute broadcast inspired them to expand their collaboration into a full length album, weaving together classical minimalism, fourth world rhythmic jazz, drone & sound design into a captivating collage. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!\n\n>> THE LAST DINNER PARTY – Prelude to Ecstasy LP (Island) *”Midnight” Black Vinyl w/ poster\n\nUK five-piece THE LAST DINNER PARTY have built up an impressive amount of hype in their short time as a band, cracking the charts overseas and opening for the STONES all without a full-length to their name. Now Prelude to Ecstasy is finally here and, frankly, it rules. Bombastic & theatrical alt-pop in the vein of SPARKS or KATE BUSH with hooks for days, a really inventive rhythm section, and some serious guitar heroics that also line this up neatly with ST VINCENT or T.REX. Produced by JAMES FORD (JESSIE WARE, ARCTIC MONKEYS) and HIGHLY, HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!\n\n>> METH. – Shame LP/CD (Prostethic) *White Vinyl ✶ ✶ ✶ ✶\n\nChicago “experimental heavy band” METH. are back with another heater, their second on Prosthetic Records. Shame’s seven tracks assault the senses relentlessly with pummeling tempos & harsh sonics that, in concert with the vox & lyrics, offer a stark, harrowing glimpse into cycles of addiction, trauma & depression. They channel many of the same influences as peers like CHAT PILE and PRIMITIVE MAN – i.e. if you’re a fan of GODFLESH, THE JESUS LIZARD, SWANS BIG BLACK/SHELLAC etc, you’ll find lots to love here and you’ll relish the challenging listen.
