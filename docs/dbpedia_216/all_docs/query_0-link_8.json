        "text": "The Black Crowes have announced a tour in support of their upcoming album, Happiness Bastards.\n\nThe nearly three-dozen-date trek starts with a Nashville show in early April and is currently scheduled to wrap up on June 9 with a festival appearance in Spain.\n\nThe Black Crowes will release Happiness Bastards, their 10th LP, on March 15; the album marks the band's first record of new music in 15 years. Their last album, Before the Frost ... Until the Freeze, featured new music by the band recorded onstage in front of an audience. They've since released an LP of new recordings of older material and an EP of songs from 1972.\n\nREAD MORE: The Black Crowes, '1972' Album Review\n\nThe announcement of Happiness Bastards included a preview of the band's new song, \"Wanting and Waiting,\" which you can hear below.\n\nBandleaders Chris and Rich Robinson resumed the band in 2019, four years after a breakup that resulted in the brothers not speaking for a few years. A 2020 tour celebrating the 30th anniversary of their debut album, Shake Your Money Maker, was put on hold because of the pandemic.\n\nThe tour eventually got underway in 2021, with the band staying busy with additional concert dates and an expanded reissue of their first album.\n\nWhere Will the Black Crowes Play Live in 2024?\n\nThe upcoming tour includes dates in Atlanta, Denver, Los Angeles and Detroit before the Black Crowes head overseas for shows in London, Paris and Berlin. You can see the tour itinerary below.\n\n\"Hope everybody is ready to rock 'n' roll with us on the Happiness Bastards Tour this spring,\" Chris Robinson noted. \"Weâ€™re excited to be playing songs from our new album along with some deeper tracks, juicy covers and the songs you want to hear.\"\n\nPresales for the Happiness Bastards Tour start on Jan. 23; tickets go on sale to the general public on Jan. 26 at 10 a.m. local. You can find more information on the band's website."
