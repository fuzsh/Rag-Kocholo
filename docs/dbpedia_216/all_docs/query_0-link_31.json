        "text": "LOCATION: Los Angeles, CA\n\nOWNER(s):\n\nTIMESPAN: 1973...\n\nMISC NOTES: This double-sided \"oldies hits\" reissue sub label of United Artists Records appeared after the UA takeover of Liberty Records ca. 1970. It replaced the discontinued Liberty \"All Time Hit Series\" In 1973 the black labeled discs and sleeves appeared featuring the image of a 1957 Chevrolet above the spindle hole. This design format continued past the mid 1980s when Capital Records took over the Silver Spotlight series. The Northwest recordings which follow initially appeared on Dolphin, Dolton, Liberty, or United Artists records.\n\nSERIAL\n\nARTIST\n\nTITLE\n\nsearch by LABEL\n\nTO SEARCH, PLEASE EITHER SCROLL THE LABEL LIST BELOW (AT LEFT) â€“ OR USE THE SEARCH FIELD BELOW (AT CENTER).\n\nScroll to see all labels\n\nSearch for a name"
