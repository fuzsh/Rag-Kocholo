        "text": "Four years later, Rubin would produce the first hip-hop single to break into the Top Five of the Billboard Hot 100 and both produce and release on the Def Jam label the first hip-hop album to top the Billboard Top 200 albums chart.\n\nThat first single was \"Walk This Way\" by RUN-D.M.C and Aerosmith and that first album was Licensed to Ill by the Beastie Boys.\n\nThe success of \"Walk This Way\" and Licensed to Ill are generally credited as \"the records that established hip-hop as a viable part of the commercial mainstream\" and lead to what would be called \"new school.\"\n\nIn 1981, Rubin moved to New York City to attend NYU and formed an artcore punk band called Hose modeled on San Francisco's Flipper.\n\nRubin played guitar - badly - and acted as the band's producer/manager.\n\nIn late 1981, he produced a 12-inch Hose EP in the activity room of his dorm covering Rick James' \"Superfreak\" and Hot Chocolate's \"You Sexy Thing\" along with three original songs.\n\nAlthough no record company actually existed, Rubin released a Hose single, \"Mobo,\" the following year with a mailing contact for Def Jam Recordings on the sleeve with \"2 University Place\" as the address. 2 University Place was Rick Rubin's dorm room.\n\nHose continued to play and tour until 1986, received some positive reviews in the music press, and opened for a number of established punk bands including Husker Du, The Buthole Surfers, and The Circle Jerks.\n\nHowever, shortly after the release of \"Mobo,\" Rubin's attention began to shift from Hose and the punk scene to hip-hop.\n\nIn 1983, Rubin and Jazzy Jay produced \"It's Yours\" featuring rapper T La Rock.\n\nThe demo of \"It's Yours\" was made in Jazzy Jay's living room and the release track later recorded at an obscure studio in Queens.\n\n\"It's Yours\" was released on Arthur Baker's Partytime Records with the Def Jam Recordings logo on the label ... although at that time, Def Jam Recordings consisted only of Rick Rubin, his dorm room, and the logo that Rubin had designed himself.\n\n\"It's Yours\" was the first release to carry the Def Jam logo, although it was released through Arthur Baker's Partytime Records and the master recording is legally held by Partytime Records.\n\nThe record was produced by Rick Rubin and recorded at Power Play Studios in Queens.\n\nThe rhymes for \"It's Yours\" were written by T La Rock (Clarence Keaton) and his younger brother, Kevin \"Special K\" of the Treacherous Three.\n\nThe backing track was created by Rick Rubin with DJ Jazzy Jay (John Byas). T La Rock performed the rap.\n\nThe crowd responses were made in the studio by friends of Rick Rubin and T La Rock including Adam Horovitz of the Beastie Boys.\n\n\"It's Yours\" was initially released in 1984 as a 12\" single and was terribly influential.\n\nIt is usually cited as the record that gave birth to what would become known as \"New School\" hip-hop.\n\nThe first track, \"It's Yours (Radio Mix),\" is the original mix released in 1984.\n\nThe second is the backing track created by Rick Rubin and DJ Jazzy Jay.\n\nThe third is the rap track recorded by T La Rock.\n\n\"It's Yours\" became an underground hit and proved to be one of the most influential hip-hop recordings made in the early 1980s.\n\nT La Rock's rap was far more lyrical and complex than most of his contemporaries and many young MCs began to emulate T La Rock's style.\n\nPerhaps more important - and influential - was Rubin's musical backing.\n\nIt was minimal, composed primarily of beats and scratches with no discernable melody, which became a central characteristic of most of the new school recordings that followed.\n\nIt established Rick Rubin as an important producer and \"It's Yours\" became the model for what would become known as new school hip-hop.\n\nShortly after the release of \"It's Yours,\" Rick Rubin was introduced to Russell Simmons.\n\n\"It was the sound of the records that inspired me to be his partner. He's a great producer and I thought, 'We can do a lot together.'\"\n\nRussell Simmons\n\nIt was at the premier party for Graffiti Rock that Rick Rubin first met Russell Simmons.\n\nAccording to Rubin, \"I remember being really excited when I met him because, as a fan of hip-hop, he had already, you know, his name on a lot of the rap records that already came out — Kurtis Blow, RUN-D.M.C. — so I was excited to meet him.\n\nAnd when I met Russell, it turns out that \"It's Yours\" was his favorite record, which was a surprise to me.\"\n\nSimmons was equally surprised to find out that a white, Jewish, barely 20-year-old undergraduate who made records out of his dorm room was the producer of \"It's Yours.\"\n\nSimmons told Rubin, \"I can't believe you made that record and you're white, 'cause that's the blackest hip-hop record that's ever been!\"\n\nAlthough Simmons was five years older than Rubin and already an established promoter and manager, they quickly found that they were kindred spirits who saw enormous potential in hip-hop and shared a common belief in the direction hip-hop should take in the 1980s.\n\nThey began to explore the possibility of working together and began to share their ideas with one another.\n\nSimmons recalled, \"We did everything together. We'd be at the studio every night; if it wasn't the studio, we were in Danceteria. I used to take him to Disco Fever in the South Bronx. I took him everywhere.\"\n\nIn turn, Simmons went to see Hose perform, entered into a management agreement with T La Rock and DJ Jazzy Jay, and even went to see Rubin DJ for three very young, white MCs who called themselves The Beastie Boys.\n\nIn 1978, Simmons left CCNY a few credits short of graduation to devote himself full-time to \"Rush Productions.\"\n\nSimmons work as a promoter came to the attention of Robert \"Rocky\" Ford who wrote for Billboard and interviewed him for one of the first articles on hip-hop to appear in the industry trade bible.\n\nThe following year, Ford and another writer at Billboard, James Briggs Moore III, approached Simmons with the idea of producing a hip-hop Christmas record that Moore had written for Kurtis Blow.\n\nThat record became \"Christmas Rappin'\" and was co-produced by Simmons with Ford and Moore.\n\nThe record sold 100,000 copies over the holidays, more than 200,000 after Christmas, and, eventually, \"Christmas Rappin'\" would sell over 500,000 copies.\n\nRussell Simmons was now a producer and about to become the manager of a client with a hit record."
