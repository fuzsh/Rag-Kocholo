At The Montreux Festival\n\nDETAILS\n\nDate: 4/20/2024\n\nFormat: LP\n\nLabel: MPS\n\nQuantity: 1000\n\nRelease type: RSD Limited Run / Regional Focus\n\nMORE INFO\n\nThis live recording from the famed festival by Lake Geneva qualifies as one of the piano trio classics of the 1970s as well as a milestone in the Jamaican pianist's catalogue. The 1976 album captures the moment in Alexander's young career when he began to be compared to such giants as Oscar Peterson. Monty's play combines the proficiency of his Canadian colleague with the feel of the Caribbean and a touch of gospel. Bassist John Clayton and drummer Jeff Hamilton form a sympathetic, cohesive rhythm section, and their clear-cut, penetrating solos are outstanding. The show captivated the audience from the first piece, an Ahmad Jamal composition that Alexander played with inspired blues variations, on through the soulful contemplations in \"Feelings\". There is an exuberance to the swing on the Ellington piece \"Satin Doll\", whereas the classic blues \"Drown in My Own Tears\" is played with sublime, gospel-tinged gravity. An archaic Afro-atmosphere permeates \"Work Song\", as Clayton shows off his virtuoso talents. With its whimsical, infectious dramaturgy, \"Battle Hymn of the Republic\" stands out as a classic. After four and a half decades the infectious magic of that night in Montreux remains alive and palpable.\n\nPressed on mint green vinyl for Record Store Day 2024.\n\nTracklist\n\n1. Night Mist Blues\n\n2. Feelings\n\n3. Statin Doll\n\n4. Work Song\n\n5. Drown In My Own Tears\n\n6. Battle Hymn Of The Republic\n\nMontreux Alexander: The Monty Alexander Trio Live!

Fitting in somewhere between contemporaries like Weather Report, Headhunters and Stone Alliance, Craig Peyton definitely ploughed his own musical furrow even in an exceptionally fertile era. Originally a jazz drummer and vibraphonist, Craig was interested in utilizing the potential of some of the new synthesizers that were coming onto the market in that era, (beating even Stevie Wonder to the use of the Fairlight keyboard). Band X consisted of Alan Grzyb, Victor Preston and Joey Bellomo alongside their auteur, Craig Peyton. Despite being, broadly speaking, ÂjazzÂ, CraigÂs music had a synthetic feel and, like many musical conceptions of the future, sounds decidedly retro-cool today. Drummer Bellomo contributed synthesizer work, and horn-player Grzyb also contributed keyboards. Bass-man Preston also played trombone, and alongside GrzybÂs bassoon and clarinet and the assorted electronics, it was not your standard jazz ensemble. Quirky song titles (some of which wouldnÂt sound out of place on a prog-rock album from the same time) confirm the image we have of a musical maverick. Much of the current demand for this very hard to find album owes itself to DJ AmirÂs championing of the track Home: many have remarked on its similarity to the classic Steely Dan sound of the same era; other reference points might be Shuggie Otis and Michael Franks. ItÂs a poignant, floaty and ultimately unique song, with Craig providing the Âblue-eyedÂ vocal, as he does on the other vocal track Afterthought, which also sounds like it couldÂve happily lived alongside ShuggieÂs Inspiration Information album. A vocal and a lively slice of sequencer space-funk with some truly trippy keyboard work, hereÂs another track with loads of potential for contemporary appreciation.\"\n\nTracklist\n\nA1 - Rip Van Winkle\n\nA2 - Red Cloud\n\nA3 - Trullion Alastor\n\nA4 - Afterthought\n\nB1 - Picking Mushrooms With Rabbit\n\nB2 - Home\n\nB3 - Black Hole\n\nThe Best of Band X Band X Band X Riding Easy Records/Permanent Records LP 'RSD First' 1000\n\nBare Jr.\n\nBoo-Tay\n\nDETAILS\n\nDate: 4/20/2024\n\nFormat: 2 x LP\n\nLabel: Legacy\n\nQuantity: 1500\n\nRelease type: 'RSD First'\n\nMORE INFO\n\nBoo-Tay, originally released in September of 1998 on the now defunct alt./punk/metal label Immortal Records, is the first full album featuring the son of country music great Bobby Bare. Unleashing a southern fried cowpunk garage rock sound with electric dulcimer, Bare Jr. is Âthe best yÂalternative band you never heard of,'' according to bassist Dean Tomasek. The band consisted of Bobby Bare, Jr. on lead vocals and guitar, Tomasek on bass, Keith Brogdon on drums, Tracy Hackney on dulcimer and harmonica, along with Nashville independent record storeÂs own Michael ÂGrimeyÂ Grimes on lead guitar.\n\nFor Record Store Day 2024, itÂs available for the first time on vinyl, and this 2xLP set includes the original Peter Collins-produced album along with the promotional live EP Custom Gauge Electric, and early demos when they were known as Bobby Joe and the Metros.\n\nBoo-Tay Bare Jr. Bare Legacy 2 x LP 'RSD First' 1500\n\nBe Bop Deluxe\n\nFuturama\n\nDETAILS\n\nDate: 4/20/2024\n\nFormat: LP\n\nLabel: Cherry Red/Esoteric\n\nQuantity: 1000\n\nRelease type: 'RSD First'\n\nMORE INFO\n\nRecorded in the first two months of 1975 at Rockfield studios (with some sessions also taking place at SARM studios in London), Futurama was the second album by Be Bop Deluxe and the first to feature the line-up of Bill Nelson (vocals, guitars, keyboards), Charlie Tumahai (bass, vocals) and Simon Fox (drums). Produced by Roy Thomas Baker (who at the time was also working with Queen), Futurama was an album of immense musical inventiveness and creativity and was a huge leap forward in creative terms for Bill Nelson.\n\nThe album gained much praise thanks to Bill NelsonÂs composition skills and his highly innovative guitar playing. Featuring such wonderful material as ÂMaid in HeavenÂ, ÂSister SeagullÂ, ÂMusic in DreamlandÂ, ÂSound TrackÂ, ÂBetween the WorldsÂ, ÂJean CocteauÂ and ÂSwan SongÂ, the album would see Be Bop Deluxe heralded as one of the most accomplished acts of 1975.

His rock-solid basslines and blues-drenched solos are balanced by clever, almost pianistic melodies and interesting progressions and phrases. McDuff began as a bassist playing with Denny Zeitlin and Joe Farrell. He studied privately in Cincinnati and worked with Johnny Griffin in Chicago. He taught himself organ and piano in the mid-Â50s, and began gaining attention working with Willis Jackson in the late Â50s and early Â60s, cutting high caliber soul-jazz dates for Prestige. McDuff made his recording debut as a leader for Prestige in 1960, playing in a studio pickup band with Jimmy Forrest. They made a pair of outstanding albums: Tough Duff and The Honeydripper.

These songs were originally released on Bandcamp for 24 hours in May 2021 Â this will be their first physical release, limited to 2500 copies on pink marble vinyl.\n\nA statement from the band about this recording: ÂLike so many other artists, we expected to play a lot of shows in 2020. To gear up for the year ahead, we decided to warm up by playing an intimate, three-night stand at a venue that's near and dear to our hearts Â the Showbox in Seattle. Well, 2020 didn't quite turn out like we had planned Â but happily those three magical nights in February 2020 did, and we're glad to say that we had them recorded!Â\n\nTracklist\n\nA1.

As a most versatile musician, he had played and recorded almost every style of music you care to mention - Soul, Reggae, Jazz, Spirituals, Blues, African, Electro. EtcÂ Originally trained in classical piano, his musical career began in Brussels and Paris in the 1950s. The 1960s finds him in Congo as a member of African Jazz led by Joseph Kabasele (Le Grand Kalle). He formed his own band in Cameroon in 1963 and then moved to Paris in 1965. For the Manu 76 album we head off to (predictably) the year of 1976, still in Paris. Four years after its international breakthrough with the hit Soul Makossa, Manu actually recorded two studio albums that year.\n\nHere he assembles a supremely talent bunch of musicians including Jo Tongo on bass, Slim Pezin on guitar, Lucien Dobat (from Kassav) on drums, Alex Francfort on piano and even Georgia Dibango, 7 years old, on the guest vocals among many others. This six tracks album is made of straddling series of styles from the Soukouss Beats of BokiloÂs Boogie and Qui est fou de qui? Â Chouchou, the Afro Boogie Jazz of the highly catchy Mimbo, the driving Afro Future-Jazz of Mouvement Ewondo, the pensive soundtrack moods of Besoka On Salsa or the bombastic Afro-Funk Soul Angola. Unarguably one of Manu DibangoÂs finest album. YouÂll be the judge.\n\nTracklist\n\n1. Qui est fou de qui ? - Chouchou\n\n4min 1s\n\n2. BokiloÂs Boogie\n\n6min 20s\n\n3. Mimbo\n\n4min 36s\n\n4.

They recorded two albums before the Touch and Go label picked them up in 1988. By this time Rick had transformed into the notorious front man Rick Didjit, whose on-stage antics were as famous as his frequently hilarious wardrobe of unconventional suits. The band's straight-up-fast brand of rock didn't sound like much else the label was putting out at the time, but nonetheless, they attracted a large cult following.\n\nFor Record Store Day 2024, a limited edition green 180g 2xLP package includes a full bonus LP of rarities and unseen photos and memorabilia, curated by Rick Sims and David Landis.
