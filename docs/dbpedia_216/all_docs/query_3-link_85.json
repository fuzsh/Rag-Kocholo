Failure to approve time sheets and expenses claims does not absolve the Client of its obligation to pay the Temporary Worker Fees in respect of the hours actually worked;\n\nThe Client is unable to dispute invoices accurately raised on the basis of Approved and Deemed Approved time sheets and the Temporary Worker Fees. Such invoices must be paid in accordance with the invoice terms.
