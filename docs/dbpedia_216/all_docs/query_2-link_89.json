        "text": "Over the past five years, some of the most famous (and infamous) stories of the music industry have hit movie theaters, from Freddie Mercury’s meteoric arrival in Bohemian Rhapsody to Elton John’s breakthrough years in Rocketman, and most recently Whitney Houston’s remarkable rise in Whitney Houston: I Wanna Dance With Somebody. Now it’s time for the big-screen debut of a name that might not be as familiar: trailblazing record executive Neil Bogart.\n\nBogart is the outsized personality at the center of a new biopic, Spinning Gold, which hits theaters March 31. The film tracks the monumental first decade of Casablanca Records, the larger-than-life label that Bogart dreamed up in the summer of 1973.\n\nThe industry upstart defied the odds to become one of the definitive labels of the 1970s, with a highly eclectic roster that included KISS, Donna Summer, Village People and George Clinton’s Parliament. At the same time, Casablanca Records typified 1970s excess, with infamous stories of drug-fuelled parties, flagrant spending and unchecked egos — all rich material for a big-screen treatment.\n\nWritten and directed by Bogart’s eldest son Tim, Spinning Gold stars Jeremy Jordan as Bogart alongside a cast of current music luminaries in key roles, including Wiz Khalifa as George Clinton, Tayla Parx as Donna Summer, Ledisi as Gladys Knight and Jason Derulo as Ron Isley. (The hit-filled soundtrack is just as star-studded.)\n\nAfter he was pushed out at Casablanca, Bogart went on to found Boardwalk Records (signing a young Joan Jett) before his tragic death in 1982, at the age of 39. In the decades since, Casablanca has had several lives, including its reinvention as a dance music label in 2012.\n\nTo celebrate the release of Spinning Gold, we’re taking a trip back through 10 of the label’s hallmark releases from the 1970s to the 2010s.\n\nKISS, \"Rock and Roll All Nite\" (1975)\n\nNeil Bogart’s first gamble as a label boss was on New York shock rockers KISS. Bogart signed the band to Casablanca Records on the strength of their demo tape, recorded with DIY grit alongside former Jimi Hendrix producer Eddie Kramer. While initially dubious of the group’s garish makeup, he backed their lean and mean 1974 debut album, KISS, even as it failed to ignite the charts.\n\nAs detailed in Classic Rock Magazine, KISS played Casablanca’s launch party at Los Angeles’ Century Plaza Hotel, bemusing the glamorous crowd to a flurry of smoke bombs and a levitating drum kit. Bogart stuck by his hard rockers, and in 1975 they released Dressed to Kill, featuring the undeniable anthem \"Rock and Roll All Nite,\" one of KISS’ setlist staples to this day.\n\nAs the story goes, Bogart, who is a credited producer on \"Rock N Roll All Nite,\" challenged songwriters Paul Stanley and Gene Simmons to write the definitive KISS song. Later in 1975, the band hit No. 9 on the Billboard 200 with the live album, Alive!, and their fire-breathing, fake-blood-spitting path was set.\n\nParliament, \"Give Up The Funk (Tear The Roof Off The Sucker)\" (1976)\n\nIf KISS represented one extreme of Casablanca’s early catalog, George Clinton’s Parliament confirmed there was no rulebook. Bogart recognised Clinton’s shambolic genius early on, signing the bandleader and his funk disciples to Casablanca in 1973. After a pair of slow-burning albums, in 1975 Parliament released Mothership Connection, an outlandish concept record exploring afrofuturism in outer space.\n\nOn an album that sounded like nothing else out there, \"Give Up The Funk (Tear the Roof off the Sucker)\" was a supremely funky standout. It became Parliament’s first certified million-selling single and gave the group the cachet to build their signature stage prop, The Mothership, which landed theatrically mid-show in a swirl of smoke.\n\nDonna Summer, \"I Feel Love\" (1977)\n\nBogart’s circle of gifted friends included Giorgio Moroder, the Italian producer behind the hallowed Musicland Studios in Munich, Germany. In 1975, Moroder played Bogart a song he’d produced for an up-and-coming American singer named Donna Summer, who was living as an expat in Munich after appearing in the musical Hair.\n\nThat song was \"Love To Love You Baby,\" a slow, slinky disco number that, on Bogart’s insistence, morphed into a 17-minute version. In its extended form, \"Love To Love You Baby\" seduced dance floors and took disco into a new realm of slow-burning sexuality.\n\nIn 1976, Summer returned to Musicland Studios with Moroder and his studio partner Pete Bellotte to record \"I Feel Love,\" released on Casablanca the next year. Still exhilarating and influential to this day, the record’s futuristic synth sound cemented Casablanca as the go-to disco label.\n\nVillage People, \"Y.M.C.A.\" (1978)\n\nWith Donna Summer now a certified star, Bogart found his next disco hitmakers in Village People. Founded in 1977 by French dance producers Jacques Morali and Henri Belolo, and fronted by vocalist Victor Willis, the group emerged from and celebrated New York’s gay club culture, with each member adopting a \"macho man\" persona and costume.\n\nVillage People’s third album on Casablanca, 1978’s Cruisin’, featured the instant earworm \"Y.M.C.A.,\" which hit No. 2 on the Billboard Hot 100 in 1979. A winking advertisement for the fraternal pleasures of the Y.M.C.A., the song became a gay anthem and paved the way for future hits \"In The Navy,” \"Go West\" and an actual song called “Macho Man.”\n\n\"[Casablanca] was a very trendy label,\" Belolo recalled to DJHistory in 2004. \"Neil Bogart was known as an entrepreneur who had the guts to take risks, and he was a very good promoter.\"\n\nKISS, \"I Was Made For Lovin’ You\" (1979)\n\nReleased on their 1979 album, Dynasty, \"I Was Made for Lovin’ You\" proved even KISS weren’t immune to disco fever. Coming two years after the hard rocking Love Gun album, this glam, light-on-its-feet return had some fans reeling.\n\nCo-written by Paul Stanley with pop songwriters Desmond Child and Vini Poncia, the single sold over 1 million copies and remains a favorite sing-along at KISS shows. To this day, its detractors include none other than Gene Simmons, who never liked his pop-tinged vocal part.\n\nCher, \"Take Me Home\" (1979)\n\nWhile Casablanca was founded on new talent, by the late 1970s, the label was courting already established stars. With 14 albums to her name by 1977, Cher met Neil Bogart through her then-boyfriend Gene Simmons. After a run of underperforming releases, Cher came around to trying disco.\n\n\"Take Me Home,\" Cher’s shimmering foray into the still-hot genre, unleashed her inner disco diva, which she explored further on two Casablanca albums, Take Me Home and Prisoner. While the legendary singer later strayed from disco, the lush, Studio 54-soaked sound of \"Take Me Home\" is testament to Casablanca’s gravitational pull.\n\nLipps Inc., \"Funkytown\" (1980)\n\nAs the 1970s ticked over into the ‘80s, Casablanca went looking for the next sound. Behind the scenes, the label was in turmoil. With Polygram now overseeing Casablanca, co-founder Larry Harris quit and Bogart was pushed out. Disco’s popularity was also waning in the wake of the infamous Disco Demolition Night at Chicago’s Comiskey Park.\n\nIf times were tough, you couldn’t hear it in \"Funkytown,\" a party-starting track by Minnesotan funk/disco band Lipps, Inc. Featuring Cynthia Johnson’s peppy vocals over a perfect marriage of synths, strings and cowbell, the song was a surprise hit for Casablanca and a gentle clapback to the disco doomsayers.\n\nIrene Cara, \"Flashdance…What A Feeling\" (1983)\n\nThroughout its first decade, Casablanca was closely aligned with Hollywood — after all, the label took its name from the Golden Age classic starring Humphrey Bogart and Ingrid Bergman. In the mid-’70s, the label even merged with a film production company to make Casablanca Record And Filmworks, Inc.\n\nFollowing Bogart’s exit from Casablanca, the label struck gold with Irene Cara’s \"Flashdance…What A Feeling\" from the 1983 dance drama Flashdance. Produced by label mainstay Giorgio Moroder, the song is a pure hit of 1980s nostalgia, elevated by Moroder’s synth and Cara’s roof-raising vocals.\n\n\"Flashdance…What A Feeling\" won the GRAMMY for Best Female Pop Vocal Performance and the Academy Award for Best Original Song, giving Casablanca Records one last victory lap before it folded in 1986.\n\nLindsay Lohan, \"Rumors\" (2004)\n\nTwo decades after Jennifer Beals spun and vaulted through the music video for \"Flashdance…What A Feeling,\" Casablanca was relaunched under Universal by veteran music exec Tommy Mottola.\n\nOne of Mottola’s early signings was \"it-girl\" Lindsay Lohan, who was coming off star-making roles in Freaky Friday and Mean Girls. Lohan’s 2004 debut album, Speak, featured the bonus track \"Rumors,\" a club banger with spiky lyrics aimed at paparazzi and rumor-mongers hounding her every move. A long way from the halcyon days of KISS and Donna Summer, \"Rumors\" is still a time capsule to a quainter era before Instagram and iPhones.\n\nMottola’s other mid-aughts signings included singer and actress Brie Larson (long before she was Captain Marvel) and pop artist Mika, whose 2007 album, Life in Cartoon Motion — and particularly its infectious lead single, “Grace Kelly” — was a breakthrough success.\n\nTiesto, \"Red Lights\" (2013)\n\nAfter its brief mid-2000s run, Casablanca Records went quiet again — that is, until its next relaunch in 2012 as a dance/electronic imprint under Republic Records. Capitalizing on the EDM boom at the time, Casablanca snapped up Dutch superstar Tiesto and his label Musical Freedom.\n\nIn December 2013, Tiesto dropped \"Red Lights,\" the lead single from his fifth studio album, A Town Called Paradise, released on Casablanca the following year. A surging dance-pop confection built for Tiesto’s then-residency at Hakkasan Las Vegas, \"Red Lights\" endures today as a three-minute flashback to EDM’s heyday.\n\nWhile Tiesto is no longer with Casablanca, the label has been a steady home for both veteran and rising dance acts over the past decade, including Martin Solveig, Chase & Status, Nicky Romero, Felix Jaehn and James Hype. Meanwhile, Lindsay Lohan has remained with the label, releasing her club-ready comeback single, \"Back to Me,” in 2020.\n\nBringing the story full circle, a resurgent Giorgio Moroder also landed back on Casablanca Records in 2016. As the story of Casablanca's glory days hits the big screen, the label's latest chapter is still being written.\n\nListen: 50 Essential Songs By The Beach Boys Ahead Of \"A GRAMMY Salute\" To America's Band\n\nLenny Kravitz is a vessel — a divining rod of creative direction.\n\n\"I just do what I'm told. I'm just an antenna. So what I hear and what I receive, I do,\" he tells GRAMMY.com. It's with that extra-sensory, spiritual guidance that Kravitz created his latest album, Blue Electric Light. \"I just saw and felt this blue light — electric blue, almost neon light —radiating down on me.\"\n\nOut May 24, Blue Electric Light is Kravtiz's first LP in six years and fittingly flits through the rocker's cosmology: Arena-ready booty shakers like \"TK421\" (the music video for which features the nearly 60-year-old unabashedly shaking his own booty), Zeppelin and Pearl Jam-inspired rockers like \"Paralyzed,\" and shared humanity-focused groovers like \"Human.\" There's plenty of '80s R&B sensibility throughout, giving Blue Electric Light a perfectly timed, timeless feeling.\n\nIt's as if Kravitz took a tour through his own discography, landing right back where he started: In high school. In fact, two of the album's tracks — \"Bundle of Joy\" and \"Heaven\" — were written when the four-time GRAMMY winner was still a teenager. While Kravitz's latest may lean into the sounds of his young adulthood, the album's underlying themes remain consistently spiritual, intimate and emotional. \"My main message is what it has always been, and that is love,\" Kravitz told GRAMMY.com in 2018. And by staying true to himself and this message of love, Lenny Kravitz is thriving.\n\n\"I've never felt better mentally, spiritually, and physically. I've never felt more vibrant,\" he says today.\n\nKravtiz has also had a big year. He received a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame and, during 2024 GRAMMY week, was honored with the Global Impact Award at Black Music Collective’s Recording Academy Honors. At the ceremony, Kravtiz was lauded for his work with his Let Love Rule foundation, and his iconic discography celebrated in a performance by Quavo, George Clinton, Earth, Wind & Fire bassist Verdine White, and Red Hot Chili Peppers drummer Chad Smith.\n\nReflecting on his achievements, Kravitz remains humble. \"Success is wonderful, but I only want success by being me and doing what it is that I'm hearing, as opposed to following something or a formula.\"\n\nAhead of releasing Blue Electric Light into the world — just a few days shy of his 60th birthday on May 26— Lenny Kravitz spoke with GRAMMY.com about revisiting his past, following his gut, and stopping to smell the flowers.\n\nYou haven't released a record in about six years. Why did you feel now was the time to put new music out, and what was inspiring you?\n\nWell, it was just by virtue of what was going on. So I released [2018's Raise Vibration and], I toured for two years. Then COVID hits two and a half years [later]. It wasn't like I went away or wasn't inspired. I had a whole other year planned. I was going to tour for three years on that last album.\n\nBut [when] COVID happened, the world shut down and I got stuck in the Bahamas for a couple of years and a half. And so during that time I was just being creative. I [wrote the whole album] during that time and a little bit afterwards; [I wrote] just maybe two songs afterwards.\n\nWhen I finished, then I had to figure out when I wanted to put it out and how. I did the Baynard Rustin song [\"Road to Freedom\" from the Academy Award-nominated film Rustin], and then I ended up pushing my album so I could fully promote the film and the legacy of Bayard Rustin.\n\nAnyway, here we are. Everything happens in the time that it should, and I'm looking forward to putting this out and getting back on the road.\n\nI read that this record was like an album that you didn't make in high school and it has this very young spirit. What took you to that place?\n\nAt the beginning of the pandemic, I released a book called Let Love Rule, and it ended up on the New York Times bestseller list. It was about my life from birth to the first album [1989's Let Love Rule], so around 24 years old. In this book, I spent a lot of time in my teenage years when I was developing. That came out at the beginning of the pandemic and I was doing a lot of press for it.\n\nAnd I think because I was exploring that time so much when I was writing the book and then talking about that time so much when I was promoting the book, it just came out. And it was a time in my life that I never really celebrated. I never put music out at that time.\n\nWhen I found my sound [on] Let Love Rule, all that material I was working on at that time got buried before. And so I just went to that place. I didn't plan on it, it just happened. In fact, two songs on the record [\"Bundle of Joy\" and \"Heaven\"] are from high school.\n\nSo it's a blend of where I am now and where I was then. And it's a really fun record and I had a really beautiful time making it. It's a celebration, and it's sensual and sexual and spiritual and social and it hits all the marks. I'm looking forward to getting out there.\n\nYou were obviously deep in your memories, and it sounds like you were probably listening to a lot of Prince in high school.\n\nThere's a lot of things. There's a blend of '80s technology and drum machines, and real instruments and synthesizers that I pulled out from then. During that time, yeah, I was listening to a lot of Bowie. I was listening to a lot of Prince, a lot of Rick James, a lot of just soul and R&B in general, and rock.\n\nAre there any songs on the record that you are particularly proud of or that are really meaningful to you?\n\nAll of them. I hear it all as one piece. So it's just one flow of consciousness, but I'm really proud of the record.\n\nOne of my favorite tracks would be the opening track, \"It's Just Another Fine Day in this Universe.\" I just think it's such a vibe and I love the way the chorus makes me feel. I think \"Stuck in the Middle\" is really pretty and sensual.\n\nSpeaking of vibes, when I'm listening to the record, it feels very hopeful. Is that generally how you've been feeling or how you go through the world these days?\n\nI'm pretty optimistic. But now even more than ever, just on a personal level, I've never felt better mentally, spiritually, and physically. I've never felt more vibrant and I'm becoming more comfortable within myself in my skin and in my place.\n\nI've learned that listening to that voice inside of me and sticking to what it is that was meant for me, my direction, has paid off and it feels good.\n\nWhat do you attribute that growth and that deep comfort to, both personally and creatively?\n\nJust [having] time to see the results. I'm blessed to live, to see the results of being faithful to what it is you've been given and told to do by the creative spirit, by God. People have always been trying to push me in different directions: \"Do this, do that, follow this, go this way. This is what's happening right now.\" Follow the trends because they're looking at it as a business and they're trying to make money and have success.\n\nYes, success is wonderful, but I only want success by being me and doing what it is that I'm hearing, as opposed to following a formula that one thinks would work. Because once you follow that, you're already late, it's already happened. And I am not about being late.\n\nI don't mind setting the tone or the trend and being early and not getting recognized for it at the time. Because I'm not doing it for the reason of receiving accolades or whatever. I'm doing it to be expressive and to truthfully represent myself.\n\nI think that's a fantastic way to be. People come around eventually, right?\n\nYes. I've been reading reviews of my heroes back in the day, and I remember seeing Led Zeppelin reviews just ripping them to shreds. Led Zeppelin [are] praised [for] being classic and genius, but at one time they were s—, somebody said. So if you live long enough and you keep doing what you're doing, if you're doing the right thing and what you're supposed to be doing, you'll see that shift in people's opinions.\n\nNot that that matters, but when you see it, it feels good because you know that you did it the way you were supposed to do it.\n\nI hear a little bit of that defiance on this record too, that and the centering of your own truth — on \"Human.\" Can you maybe tell me a little bit about that track and how it came to you?\n\nWell, it just came like they all come. So I hear it and I think to myself, Okay, that's interesting. That has this real pop anthem, very uplifting feeling. [The song] speaks to us as spiritual beings having this human existence on this planet.\n\nWe are at our most powerful when we are authentic to ourselves. When you're authentic to who you are, you're shining and you represent what it is that you're meant to represent. And so the song just speaks on that, and really using this human existence to learn and to walk in your lane to reach your destiny.\n\nIn life since we've been born, we've been told what to do and how to do it: \"Don't go this direction, go that way,\" and \"No, don't do this, do that because this is the way it's done\" or \"This is what's safe.\" And we're all born with a gift; we're all born with a direction. And we don't all hit the marks because sometimes we don't accept what our gift is. Or we're too busy looking at others and what their gift is and we want what they have, and we leave behind what we were given. We go chase something that is not for us; it's that other person's calling.\n\nSo the more we shed all of that and really just walk in our lane, the better. And I am enjoying this journey of humanness and learning and growing, falling, getting up, climbing up the mountain, falling again, getting back up, continuing up. That's what it's about. It's not about how many times you fall... It's about how you get up and keep going. We're all here to live and learn and, hopefully, love.\n\nI'm curious if the title of the record translates to this idea at all. Does Blue Electric Light manifest in any real way to you as a spiritual guide?\n\nTo me, it's a feeling. I just saw and felt this blue light — electric blue, almost neon light —radiating down on me, and that light is life. It's God, it's love, it's humanity, it's energy. And just metaphorically, that's what that represents to me.\n\nRight on. To take it away a little bit from the existential and the spiritual, you just received the Global Impact Award at the 2024 GRAMMYs. You said you're not doing these things for accolades, but I'm curious how it felt to be recognized for this aspect of your work — something that isn't inherently musical that's a little more outside yourself.\n\nWhere I am in life right now is, if someone's going to hand you flowers, then stop, smell them and enjoy them. And that's what I'm doing.\n\nI make my art because I make my art and for no other reason, but when handed these flowers, I'm appreciative. I'm grateful, and I will enjoy them because I spent my whole career not doing that. I was always moving so fast and [was] not only concerned with the art and moving forward, that I didn't enjoy those moments when you get awards or things. So I made a promise to myself years ago, moving forward when the flowers are delivered, that I will stop and smell them, take a moment, breathe, and then move forward.\n\nAnd that's what I'm doing, because every day of life is beautiful. And when you can celebrate, why not celebrate?\n\nAmen to that. It's that presence of mind and spirit that you have been talking about this whole time and seems to have flowed through your artwork as well. With regard to the work with your Let Love Rule foundation, are there any projects that you would love to tackle next?\n\nThere's so many. From some things I've been doing with friends, like building certain foundations in Africa with someone that's on the ground there, doing it firsthand with orphanages in schools, to the medical situation in the Bahamas, to continue providing medical and dental care for free to the people so they can have their basic health issues taken care of.\n\nAnd then also working with kids in the arts and helping to give them a foundation to work from. These are things that I'm interested in.\n\nYaya Bey Embraced Everything On 'Ten Fold': How Her Journey Out Of Grief Lit The Way For Her New Album\n\nAs the GRAMMY Hall of Fame celebrates its 50th anniversary, the Recording Academy and GRAMMY Museum are proud to honor the 2024 inductees with the inaugural GRAMMY Hall of Fame Gala, presented by City National Bank, taking place Tuesday, May 21, at the Novo Theater in Los Angeles.

Released on Tommy Boy Records in 1989 — considered one of the years during hip-hop’s \"Golden Age\" — and produced by legendary DJ and hip-hop producer Prince Paul, the album was a critical and commercial success. Featuring samples that draw on a vast array of genres — from doo-wop and psychedelic rock to children’s music — the album was unlike any hip-hop album that came before it. Melding inventive production with clever and humorous wordplay and samples from artists as diverse as Johnny Cash (the title of the album is derived from the Cash song \"Five Feet High and Rising\"), Hall & Oates, Steely Dan, and the Turtles, 3 Feet High And Rising is often considered the beginning of 1990s alternative hip-hop. De La Soul’s use of skits/comedy sketches as interludes also had a huge influence on future generations of rappers. In a review of the album for The Village Voice in 1989, music critic Robert Christgau wrote, \"An inevitable development in the class history of rap, [De La Soul is] new wave to Public Enemy’s punk.\"\n\nFeaturing the singles \"The Magic Number,\" \"Buddy,\" \"Eye Know,\" and the GRAMMY-nominated \"Me Myself and I,\" 3 Feet High and Rising spent five weeks at No. 1 on the Billboard Top R&B/Hip-Hop Albums chart. \"Buddy\" is one of the album’s hallmark songs and features cameos from Q-Tip, Phife Dawg, Jungle Brothers, Queen Latifah, and Monie Love — who are collectively known as the Native Tongues (along with Black Sheep, the Beatnuts and Chi Ali).\n\nThe platinum-certified record consistently places on lists of the greatest albums of all time, including in 2023 when Paste magazine featured it at No. 4 on their list of the Greatest Debut Albums of the 1980s. In 2010 it was selected by the Library of Congress for preservation in the National Recording Registry. 3 Feet High and Rising has influenced countless artists, from the Roots and Yasiin Bey to OutKast and Common. With the album's undeniably trailblazing release, Posdnuos, Trugoy the Dove and Pasemaster Mase of De La Soul have cemented themselves as one of the best rap groups of all time.\n\nKelvin \"Posdnuos\" Mercer – Artist/Songwriter\n\nDavid \"Trugoy the Dove\" Jolicoeur – Artist/Songwriter\n\nVincent \"Maseo\" Mason – Artist/Songwriter\n\n\"Prince Paul\" Huston – Producer/Engineer/Songwriter\n\nAlan Watts – Engineer/Mixer\n\nGuns N’ Roses, Appetite For Destruction\n\nGeffen, 1987\n\nGuns N’ Roses’ Appetite For Destruction LP will go down in history as one of the most iconic and influential rock albums ever made. But when it was released in the summer of 1987, Appetite didn’t initially garner much mainstream attention. Once the band hit the road in support of the album, singles \"Welcome to the Jungle\", \"Paradise City\" and \"Sweet Child O' Mine\" started getting significant airplay. By the summer of 1988, the band found themselves with a No. 1 album on the Billboard 200. Appetite For Destruction became the best-selling album of all time in the U.S. and the best-selling debut album. In a review for Pitchfork, Maura Johnston said, \"The debut from Guns N' Roses was a watershed moment in '80s rock that chronicled every vice of Los Angeles led by the lye-voiced Axl Rose and a legendary, switchblade-sharp band.\"\n\nProduced by Mike Clink, Appetite for Destruction is widely considered a near perfect album where the deep cuts are just as good as the hits. From the opening roar of \"Welcome to the Jungle\" and the iconic \"Sweet Child O’ Mine,\" to \"It's So Easy,\" \"Nightrain,\" \"You're Crazy,\" and \"Mr. Brownstone,\" the album is an artistic triumph in sound, songwriting and production, earning its place at No. 62 on Rolling Stone’s list of the 500 Greatest Albums of All Time. In many ways, the album changed the world. In a 2018 article for Revolver, Dan Epstein noted that Appetite ushered in a new wave of bands like the Black Crowes with its \"blues-based music played by an unflashy yet hard-swinging rhythm section, a rock-solid rhythm guitarist, a flashy-but-soulful lead player and a charismatic vocalist who exuded danger and decadence.\" It also paved the way for Nirvana and the arrival of grunge as rock fans’ \"ears were primed for more raw, real and rebellious hard rock.\" Now, nearly 40 years since its release, Appetite for Destruction has sold over 30 million copies worldwide and is without a doubt one of the most successful debut albums of all time.\n\nAxl Rose – Artist/Songwriter\n\nSlash – Artist/Songwriter\n\nDuff McKagan – Artist/Songwriter\n\nSteven Adler – Artist/Songwriter\n\nIzzy Stradlin – Artist/Songwriter\n\nMike Clink – Engineer/Producer\n\nSteve Thompson – Mixer\n\nBuena Vista Social Club, Buena Vista Social Club\n\nWorld Circuit/Nonesuch, 1997\n\nIn 1996, a group of veteran Cuban musicians was assembled to record an album that would pay tribute to Cuba’s \"musical golden age\" of the 1930s to 1950s. Showcasing styles of music that were popular at the time, such as son, bolero and danzón, the group became known as the Buena Vista Social Club, named after a 1940s-era members-only music club that was located in the Buenavista quarter of Havana. Organized by British music producer and executive Nick Gold and produced by GRAMMY-winning American guitarist Ry Cooder and Cuban director Juan de Marcos Gonzalez, Buena Vista Social Club recorded their eponymous 14-track debut album in just six days. Released in September 1997, the album featured 20 of Cuba’s most prominent musicians, including vocalist Ibrahim Ferrer (1927–2005), pianist Rubén González (1919–2003), and vocalist/guitarist Compay Segundo (1907–2003). Buena Vista Social Club was an instant hit with tracks such as the four-chord song \"Chan Chan,\" written by Segundo, and a rendition of the romantic criolla \"La Bayamesa.\" Everything fell into place at the right time for this album — from the chemistry between the musicians to the rich music history of Havana — to create one of the moments that can only be described as pure musical magic. Buena Vista Social Club sold more than 1 million copies, earned a spot on the Billboard 200, and won the GRAMMY Award for Best Tropical Latin Performance.\n\nIn 1998 the ensemble held performances in Amsterdam and New York that were captured on film by German director Wim Wenders. Along with interviews with musicians that were conducted in Havana, a documentary, titled Buena Vista Social Club, was released in 1999 and earned an Oscar nomination for Best Documentary (Feature). In 2003, Buena Vista Social Club was named on Rolling Stone’s list of the 500 Greatest Albums of All Time, and in 2022, it was selected by the Library of Congress for preservation in the National Recording Registry. Further cementing its place in the music history books, Buena Vista Social Club was recognized by Guinness World Records as the best-selling album of world music with more than 8 million copies sold worldwide.\n\nRy Cooder – Leader/Producer\n\nJuan Demarcos Gonzalez – Director\n\nLarry Hirsch – Engineer\n\nJerry Boys – Engineer/Mixer\n\nDonna Summer, \"I Feel Love\"\n\nCasablanca, 1977\n\nWhen the Queen of Disco, Donna Summer, released her hit single \"I Feel Love\" in 1977, it propelled Brian Eno (who was in the studio with David Bowie at the time) to rush in and declare, \"This single is going to change the sound of club music for the next 15 years.\" Now, more than 40 years after its release, \"I Feel Love\" definitely changed something – it changed pop music forever. Recorded with producers Giorgio Moroder and Pete Bellotte, the goal was to create a song that signified the future — and it did. \"I Feel Love\" was the first song to pair repetitive synthesizer loops with four-on the-floor bass drum and an off-beat hi-hat, helping to forge the path for synth pop, New Romantics, Italo disco, Hi-NRG, electro, house, techno, and more. Along the way, the global smash influenced countless artists, including Blondie, who became one of the first punk-associated groups to embrace disco, releasing \"Heart of Glass\" the following year.\n\nUpon its release, \"I Feel Love\" reached No. 1 in several countries, including the UK, and peaked in the Top 10 on the Billboard 200. In 2012, the Library of Congress selected it for preservation in the National Recording Registry. Many of today’s biggest artists have paid tribute to Summer’s groundbreaking track with covers or samples, including Madonna, Red Hot Chili Peppers, Bronski Beat, and Beyoncé, the latter of whom samples \"I Feel Love\" on \"Summer Renaissance,\" the closing track on her 2022 GRAMMY-winning album Renaissance. To this day, \"I Feel Love\" is considered the No. 1 greatest dance song of all time (Rolling Stone).\n\nThe song's impact on the LGBTQ+ community is equally as great as its impact on the dance community. GRAMMY-winning artist Sam Smith, who released a cover of \"I Feel Love\" in 2019, wrote on X: \"As a queer person, ‘I Feel Love’ has followed me to every dance floor in every queer space from the minute I started clubbing. This song, to me, is an anthem of our community.\" In 2023, Pride Life Global ranked the track as one of the best gay anthems.\n\nDonna Summer – Artist/Songwriter\n\nGiorgio Moroder – Producer/Songwriter\n\nPete Bellotte – Producer/Songwriter\n\nJürgen Koppers – Artist/Songwriter\n\nCharley Pride, \"Kiss An Angel Good Mornin'\"\n\nRCA Victor, 1971\n\n\"Kiss An Angel Good Mornin’\" is GRAMMY winner Charley Pride’s biggest hit of his career. Released in 1971 as the first single from his GRAMMY-winning album Charley Pride Sings Heart Songs, the song peaked at No. 21 on the Billboard Hot 100, his only single to break the Top 40. Considered one of Pride’s signature songs, the track marked his eighth single to top the Billboard Hot Country Songs chart and became one of the biggest country hits of the decade. \"Kiss An Angel Good Mornin’\" was produced by Cowboy Jack Clement (Waylon Jennings, Willie Nelson, Dolly Parton) and written by Ben Peters, who got the inspiration for the song after he and his wife Jackie welcomed their daughter Angela. It’s a song purely about love and a slight departure from Pride’s other hits, such as \"I’m Just Me\" and \"I’d Rather Love You.\" In a 2021 article for CMT, Marcus K. Dowling writes, \"The achievement of conveying life's simple joys with a magnificent voice over complex countrypolitan rhythms and melodies — instead of discussing complex emotions over those same types of tracks — is the greatest victory of Pride's signature song.\" The single also earned Pride a GRAMMY nomination for Best Country Vocal Performance, Male. Since its release, \"Kiss An Angel Good Mornin’\" has been covered by countless artists, including George Jones, Conway Twitty, Gene Stuart, and Roy Clark — all of whom released the song in 1972 — along with Percy Sledge, Alan Jackson and Heather Myles.\n\nWhen he signed with RCA in 1964, Pride became the first Black country music singer to get a major record label deal. He went on to have 29 No. 1 hits on the Billboard Hot Country Songs chart, selling more than 70 million records. When it comes to sales for RCA, he is second only to Elvis Presley. Though he passed away in December 2020, Pride’s impact on country music, especially Black country music artists, remains. His influence can be heard in the music of up-and-coming artists such as Brittney Spencer, Mickey Guyton and Shy Carter. As country music’s first Black superstar, Pride and his warm baritone captivated audiences, broke racial and cultural barriers, and earned him an induction into the Grand Ole Opry in 1993.\n\nCharley Pride – Artist\n\nJack Clement – Producer\n\nBen Peters – Songwriter\n\nRay Butts – Artist\n\nMike Shockley – Producer\n\nWanda Jackson, \"Let's Have A Party\"\n\nCapitol, 1960\n\nOriginally recorded by Elvis Presley for the 1957 musical/romance film Loving You, \"Let’s Have a Party\" was recorded by Wanda Jackson and released on her eponymous debut album in 1958. After Jackson’s version of \"Let’s Have a Party\" was discovered by an Iowa disc jockey and received an increase in interest from radio listeners, Capitol Records encouraged Jackson to release the song as a single two years later in 1960. The song became a hit, making the Top 40 in the U.S. and topping the chart in the U.K. The success of \"Let’s Have a Party\" inspired Jackson to rename her band the Party Timers and Capitol subsequently released the compilation album, Rockin’ With Wanda that same year. As one of the first women to have a career in rock and roll, Jackson recorded a series of singles in the 1950s that helped earn her the nickname of The Queen of Rockabilly. It was Elvis, with whom she toured with in 1955, who encouraged her to record in the rockabilly style.\n\nIn 2005, Jackson received the Fellowship Award from the National Endowment for the Arts, becoming the first female country and rock artist to receive the honor. In 2009, after several artists advocated on her behalf — including Elvis Costello, Bruce Springsteen and Cyndi Lauper — Jackson was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame. Lauper has cited Jackson as one of her earliest influences, recording a cover of \"Funnel of Love\" for her 2016 album Detour. Other artists who have listed Jackson as an influence include Adele and Elle King.\n\nLauper told Rolling Stone in 2016: \"I think for country you look at Patsy Cline or Loretta Lynn who played a guitar, or sang the songs she wrote, and Dolly Parton. But Wanda Jackson was a rocker, and so, of course, I was going to listen and learn from her because I was a rocker and that's what we did.\"\n\nJackson is also a member of the Rockabilly Hall of Fame, the Iowa Rock and Roll Hall of Fame, the Oklahoma Hall of Fame, and the Oklahoma Country Music Hall of Fame. In 2010, she was the recipient of the Lifetime Achievement Award from the Americana Music Honors.\n\nWanda Jackson – Artist\n\nKen Nelson – Producer/Engineer\n\nJesse Mae Robinson – Songwriter\n\nKid Ory’s Creole Orchestra (As Spike’s Seven Pods Of Pepper Orchestra), \"Ory's Creole Trombone\"\n\nNordskog, 1922\n\nLouisiana-born composer, trombonist and bandleader Edward \"Kid\" Ory put New Orleans jazz on the map. Kid Ory’s 1922 hit \"Ory’s Creole Trombone\" was the first recording of Black/Creole New Orleans jazz. Recorded in Los Angeles, the single features Ory on trombone, along with Thomas \"Papa Mutt\" Carey on cornet, Oliver \"Dink\" Johnson on clarinet, Fred Washington on piano, Ed \"Montudie\" Garland on bass, and Ben Borders on drums. Upon release, the entire first pressing of 5,000 records sold out, leading to gigs for Ory and his band down the California coast in San Diego and Tijuana.\n\nBorn on Christmas Day in LaPlace, Louisiana, Ory led a band early on in his career in New Orleans that featured music legends such as Joe \"King\" Oliver, Johnny Dodds, Johnny St. Cyr and, later, Louis Armstrong. Ory relocated to Los Angeles after the prohibition of alcohol in 1919 changed the landscape for jazz musicians performing in New Orleans nightclubs. Many of the musicians who played on his L.A. sessions had also recently relocated from New Orleans. After moving to Chicago in 1925, where jazz was just starting to gain traction, Ory worked and recorded with artists such as Armstrong, Jelly Roll Morton, Bessie Smith, Ma Rainey, and many others. He was an original member of Louis Armstrong and His Hot Five, with whom he would later re-record \"Ory’s Creole Trombone\" in 1927. As demonstrated on \"Ory's Creole Trombone,\" Ory was an early adapter of the glissando technique, now a central element of New Orleans jazz. While he might not have been the first to play a glissando on a trombone, he was certainly the most influential.\n\nIn 2005, \"Ory’s Creole Trombone\" was selected by the Library of Congress for preservation in the National Recording Registry. In an essay written upon the recording's selection by the Library of Congress, GRAMMY-nominated musician and jazz historian David Sager wrote, \"‘Ory’s Creole Trombone’ offers a rare glimpse into the origins of New Orleans jazz and a remarkable insight to this music’s durability and universal appeal.\" A pioneering record and one of the most essential jazz recordings, \"Ory’s Creole Trombone\" helped define the New Orleans style of jazz and served as the prototype for future musicians of that genre.\n\nEdward \"Kid\" Ory – Artist/Songwriter\n\nLauryn Hill, The Miseducation Of Lauryn Hill\n\nRuffhouse Records / Columbia Records, 1998\n\nWidely considered one of the greatest albums of all time, The Miseducation of Lauryn Hill is the debut album and only solo studio set released by GRAMMY-winning singer and rapper Lauryn Hill. The album debuted at No. 1 on the Billboard 200 and sold more than 422,000 copies in its first week, breaking the record for first-week sales by a female artist. Credited for bringing hip-hop and neo-soul to the forefront of popular music, the album earned Hill 10 GRAMMY nominations, which now has her tied with Beyoncé for the Guinness World Record for most GRAMMY nominations in a single year for a female artist. Hill turned half of those nominations into wins, taking home the awards for Album Of The Year, Best New Artist, Best R&B Album, and Best Rhythm & Blues Song and Best Female R&B Vocal Performance for \"Doo Wop (That Thing).\" With lyrics that present arguably the most poignant of female perspectives on life, love and relationships, while also touching on the turmoil within her former group the Fugees, three of the album’s singles — \"Everything Is Everything, \"Ex-Factor\" and \"Doo Wop (That Thing)\" — peaked in the Top 40 on the Billboard 200, with the latter claiming the top spot.\n\nThe Miseducation of Lauryn Hill was partially recorded at Bob Marley’s studio Tuff Gong Studios in Kingston, Jamaica, while Hill was pregnant with her first son, Zion. Speaking about that time, Hill told Rolling Stone, \"When some women are pregnant, their hair and their nails grow, but for me it was my mind and ability to create. I had the desire to write in a capacity that I hadn't done in a while. I don't know if it's a hormonal or emotional thing ... I was very in touch with my feelings at the time.\" The album’s track \"To Zion,\" which features Carlos Santana on guitar, is a song about her son.\n\nIn 1999, Hill became the first hip-hop artist to appear on the cover of TIME magazine. Now, more than 25 years since its release and with more than 20 million copies sold, The Miseducation of Lauryn Hill continues to be one of the most influential albums ever made.\n\nLauryn Hill – Artist/Producer/Songwriter\n\nGordon \"Commissioner Gordon\" Williams – Engineer\n\nTony Prendatt – Engineer\n\nThe Doobie Brothers, \"What A Fool Believes\"\n\nWarner Bros. Records, 1978\n\nOne of the few non-disco songs to hit No. 1 on the Billboard Hot 100 in 1979, the Doobie Brothers’ \"What a Fool Believes\" is featured on their 1978 eighth studio album, the Album Of The Year-nominated Minute by Minute. Co-written by Michael McDonald and Kenny Loggins, \"What a Fool Believes\" won the Doobie Brothers two GRAMMY Awards, including Record Of The Year. Stylistically speaking, the song is unlike anything the Doobie Brothers had done before.\n\n\"What a Fool Believes\" started off as a piano piece idea McDonald had. Producer Ted Templeman heard what he was working on and encouraged him to put some lyrics down with a co-writer. It turns out that McDonald and Loggins had talked about working together for some time. When they got together at McDonald’s house in Los Angeles to write, Loggins had already come up with the song’s hook — \"she had a place in his life.\" Telling the story of a man who attempts to rekindle a romantic relationship, \"What a Fool Believes\" is about the lies we sometimes tell ourselves about past romances. When the protagonist in the song attempts to reconnect with an old love, he realizes that he barely registers in the woman’s mind. The Doobie Brothers and Templeman recorded numerous takes of its rhythm track over five or six days, but they couldn’t land on a version they all liked. Templeman eventually decided to cut up the master tape of a recording into sections. \"In those days when you cut the tape, you’re over – that’s the master of your recording,\" recalled Templeman in an interview with The Guardian in 2022. \"But we got lucky and I put it together on the spot.\" McDonald completed the rest of the arrangement, adding keyboards, vocals and strings. Before it was released by the Doobie Brothers, Loggins released his own jazzier and experimental version of the song on his 1978 album Nightwatch.\n\n\"What a Fool Believes\" was rated as the Doobie Brothers’ all-time greatest song by Ultimate Classic Rock critic Michael Gallucci and listed on Rolling Stone’s Top 500 Greatest Songs of All Time list. Today, \"What a Fool Believes\" is considered a \"foundational yacht rock classic,\" as Tom Breihan wrote in a review for Stereogum in 2020.

Recorded as a demo with members of the Mar-Keys and MG’s, \"You Don’t Miss Your Water\" was originally released as a B-side of his single \"Formula of Love\" and gained steam after DJs flipped the record over and started playing \"You Don’t Miss Your Water.\" The song became the first hit for Stax Records, charting on the Billboard Hot 100 in 1962. It was later released on Bell’s 1967 album The Soul of a Bell and remains his best-known recording to this day.\n\n\"The message is universal: appreciate what you have,\" said Bell in a 2022 interview with Uncut magazine. \"Back then I didn’t realize what I was writing, but after I got a little older, I realized that although the world changes physically, every generation has the same wishes, desires and aspirations. If you just write truthfully about life and write things you think will help people, it will resonate.\"\n\nAnd indeed, the song did resonate. More than six decades since its release, \"You Don’t Miss Your Water\" has gone on to become a Southern classic. Countless artists have recorded covers of it, including Otis Redding, Percy Sledge, Taj Mahal, Jerry Lee Lewis, the Black Crowes, Sturgill Simpson, Peter Tosh & the Wailers, Brian Eno, and, most notably, the Byrds, on their seminal 1968 country-rock album Sweetheart of the Rodeo.\n\nIn 2013, Bell performed \"You Don’t Miss Your Water\" before President Barack Obama during \"In Performance at the White House: Memphis Soul.\" The following year, Bell was featured in the documentary Take Me to the River, reflecting upon American music's soul. He was inducted into the Memphis Music Hall of Fame in 2016. In 2020, the National Endowment for the Arts celebrated him as a Heritage Fellow. Bell was instrumental in ushering in the Southern soul music genre, which is now known as the globally influential \"Memphis Sound.\"\n\nWilliam Bell – Artist/Songwriter\n\nChips Moman – Producer\n\nExplore The History Of The GRAMMY Hall Of Fame"
