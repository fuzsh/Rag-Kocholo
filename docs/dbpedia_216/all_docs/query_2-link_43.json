That day is getting a little closer for Steve Perry.\n\nThe Latest Info That Has Changed Steve’s Mind\n\nRecently, Steve Perry signed up for a record label. ( He won’t mention which one yet.) He is now hinting at a return to concert for a solo tour in 30 years. Steve last performed a full-length concert in 1987 with old bandmates Journey.\n\nRecent Interview Gives Us More Insite On The News\n\nSteve talked recently with Rolling Stone and said, ” “There’s been a big, soulful reclaiming of this original feeling that I had about singing that I needed to get back to,” says the former Journey singer. Read the interview with Steve Perry & Rolling Stone Here\n\nA Recent Recording Release Of An Old Journey Might Be The Reason\n\nIt Could Have Been You\n\nSteve Perry Re-Records Journey Song From Raised On Radio Journey fans couldn’t be more happy at the news. Hall of Famer Steve Perry and the band The Effect with Trevor Lukather ( son of Tot’s Steve Lukather) have released a re-recording of Journey’s “It Could Have Been You.” The song was originally on the 1986 twice-platinum album Raised on Radio.\n\nSteve Perry Found Having Fun At A Baseball Game\n\nLast Release Was A Steve Perry Christmas Album\n\n“The Season” was a Christmas album released on November 5, 2021, by Fantasy Records. It received a lukewarm reception as Steve’s voice had changed a little from what fans were used to. I loved the album and it is a part of my Christmas holiday every year.\n\nI Think The Timing Is Perfect To Return To Music\n\nSteve feels confident, and his voice is strong. I think the timing is right. People will welcome Steve Perry back and will sell out wherever venue he decides to play.\n\nWhat Are The Chances Of A Journey Reunion Now?\n\nStill, a faraway thought just from the drama the band has gone through in just the past five years. Steve Smith, the drummer, is gone, Johnathan Cain and Neal Schon are playing without problems. So that’s a good sign. No, Ross Valory. Greg Rolie makes guest appearances once in a while.\n\nJourney Still Out On The Road And Playing Comerica Park\n\nMark down on your WCSX calendar for July 15th at Comerica Park. Journey is currently on tour with Def Leppard and The Steve Miller Band. More Info On The Show Here\n\nBorn in Mt Clemens, Screamin’ Scott has been a part of the Detroit airwaves for 30-plus years.
