        "text": "They called their new album “Warpaint,” but the Black Crowes’ true colors don’t seem to wash off.\n\nTheir new album’s bluesy roots rock has pushed the Black Crowes back into the spotlight and back in Tahoe for a show Friday in the South Shore Room at South Lake Tahoe. As the band is still spreading its wings after a four-year hiatus and has released its first album in seven years, it’s probably safe to call “Warpaint” the Crowes’ comeback.\n\n“The thing about the last three years has been, ‘How do we continue to be independent? How do we begin to exercise control and freedom over our own trip?’ That’s what the title is all about,” lead singer Chris Robinson said in the biography on the Black Crowes’ Web site.\n\n“It’s a little more self-assured and has a bit more swagger,” he said. “Not since ‘Southern Harmony (and Musical Companion)’ have we had such a crystal-clear picture of where we are and where we’re going.”\n\nThe Robinson brothers appear to be in agreement – about the new album, anyway: “Every record was a great experience to get us to where we are today,” guitarist Rich Robinson said on the Web site. “This is what we love to do, and we want to do it the best we can.”\n\nNone other than Lake Tahoe Action competitor Rolling Stone anointed the Crowes’ comeback, putting “Goodbye Daughters of the Revolution” on its “Hot List” for February: “It’s time to get out your embarrassing old T-shirt – the one with the drunk birds on it – and wear it with pride. On their first new song in years, the Crowes are catchier and more ‘Exile on Main Street’-y than ever. Now maybe Chris Robinson will be able to afford some shoes.”\n\nThe magazine went on to award the new album three and a half stars, while All Music Guide gave it four and a half out of five. That was after Maxim’s two-and-a-half-star review unwittingly thrust itself and the Crowes back in the news in late February. The magazine apologized for publishing a review by a writer who hadn’t listened to the whole CD.\n\nEven without Maxim’s gaffe, the first Black Crowes CD in seven years probably would have made a splash. The band took a break in 2001 and didn’t return to the stage together until reuniting for five shows at New York’s Hammerstein Ballroom in March 2005. After touring, the band turned to former member Paul Stacey to produce “Warpaint” at Allaire Studios in upstate New York.\n\n“Allaire is stunningly beautiful, so quiet and isolated,” Rich Robinson said. “It brings a focus and inspiration to what you’re doing. You do draw from the place where you are.”\n\n“You listen to Dylan, you listen to Bob Marley, you listen to anything, from blues to up until now, and really the things that last and mean something are beautiful songs about universal themes that mean something about the integrity of human beings, about love, about passion – all the great virtues we sort of lost through technology and TV and self-absorption.”\n\nYet it isn’t a concept album or a rock opera.\n\n“People have wondered if it’s a political record or if these are protest songs,” Chris Robinson said. “I say no, my politics are the politics of beauty. And if that’s something you’re into, then you have to understand the myriad of shades we have in something beautiful – from joy to pain to sorrow, from tenderness to ugliness. All those things are in there.”\n\nAs Rolling Stone pointed out, the Crowes have endured so many changes that Wikipedia has a color-coded chart of who was in the band when. With Stacey behind the boards, the Crowes showcased a different lineup with “Warpaint.” Joining the Robinson brothers are drummer Steve Gorman and Sven Pipien on bass, along with two new members, Adam MacDougall on keyboards and guitarist Luther Dickinson of the North Mississippi Allstars.\n\n“Luther couldn’t have complimented the material or what the band does any better, and what Adam has brought to the band is equally a gift to our music,” Chris Robinson said.\n\nRich Robinson found kinship with the band’s new guitarist.\n\n“Luther fit in before he even plugged in to play,” he said. “He comes from where we come from, he loves the music we love, and he brought so much new to our songs. Same thing goes for Adam. Bringing them in – their energy, playing and approach – just made it so seamless and great. The first week we were in the studio, we recorded the majority of the album. We just knocked it out.”\n\n“Warpaint” is the Crowes’ seventh studio album. The band debuted with “Shake Your Money Maker” in 1990, which spawned hits in “Twice as Hard” and “She Talks to Angels,” as well as a cover of Otis Redding’s “Hard to Handle.” “Remedy” and “Thorn in My Pride,” both from their 1992 sophomore effort, “The Southern Harmony and Musical Companion,” broke the top 100.\n\nWith “Amorica,” the band landed in hot water, with stores refusing to carry the album with the controversial cover. According to Wikipedia, the tour for “Amorica” provided the Crowes with the opportunity to open for the Grateful Dead in April 1995, the only time the two bands played together, as Jerry Garcia died four months later.\n\n“Three Snakes and One Charm” followed the next year, and the Black Crowes joined the 1997 Furthur Festival before tensions within the band led to the ouster of guitarists Marc Ford and Johnny Colt. Pipien joined in time for “By Your Side” in 1999, a record that fizzled commercially and led to the Crowes’ release from Columbia Records.\n\nAccording to Wikipedia, the band was still a viable live act despite the troubles with the record company, joining Led Zeppelin guitarist Jimmy Page for two shows in New York and Los Angeles, which lead to a tour with Page and the Who in 2000. Chris Robinson married actress Kate Hudson on New Year’s Eve 2000, before heading back to the studio for the sessions that would yield “Lions” on the V2 label in 2001. The band temporarily dissolved later that year with the departure of drummer Gorman.\n\nThe band’s hiatus ended in 2005, with the Robinson brothers, keyboardist Eddie Harsch, Ford, Pipien and drummer Bill Dobrow. Gorman soon replaced Dobrow on the road. By August 2007, the band was in the incarnation that would release “Warpaint.”\n\n“It’s a little more self-assured and has a bit more swagger,” Chris Robinson said. “Not since ‘Southern Harmony’ have we had such a crystal-clear picture of where we are and where we’re going.”\n\n“Even in our most comercially successful period, there was nothing like us on any format,” he said. “By the time grunge happened, ‘Southern Harmony’ and ‘Amorica’ didn’t fit into any part of popular music. We looked different, we sounded different, and we set up our culture a little different. Everybody who wanted to bag us because they thought they knew what we were missed out on a lot of good music, good concerts and a band that, even at our weirdest, had something to say.”\n\nThe Black Crowes\n\nWhen: Friday, April 25\n\nWhere: Harrah’s South Shore Room\n\nTickets: $50"
