        "text": "Shake Your Money Maker is the debut album by The Black Crowes, released in February 1990 on Def American Recordings. It is the only album by the band to feature guitarist Jeff Cease. The album is named after a classic blues song written by Elmore James. The Black Crowes have played the song live many times over the years, but it is not included on this album. Shake Your Money Maker peaked at #4 on the Billboard 200, and two of its singles, \"Hard to Handle\" and \"She Talks to Angels\", reached #1 on the Mainstream Rock Tracks chart. \"Jealous Again\", \"Twice As Hard\" and \"Seeing Things\" were also charting singles in the US. Shake Your Money Maker is the Black Crowes' best-selling album, having sold more than 5 million copies."
