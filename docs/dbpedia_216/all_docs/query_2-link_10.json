Don't get all the hate for it...\n\n...EXCEPT for the fact that it's probably one of the worst masterings in rock.\n\nI can use that disc and Three Snakes to demonstrate why compression is bad to my friends. They go \"OH. GOD. Yeah, that's obvious\"\n\nIf Lions were remastered I think it could be a really great album. Who doesn't like the solo in Greasy Grass River? Or the acoustic work in Soul Singin? Or the huge chords in that opening track?\n\nbtw, there are several masterings of this catalog out there, and I have never really known which are the good ones.\n\nHas anyone compared? 4 pages of recommendations and I haven't seen anyone talk about mastering\n\nSeems like there was a big reissue campaign in 2002, and then 2007. Done well? Avoid at all costs?\n\nWhether you like the songs or not, I'd really like to find out which version of Lions might not sound so horrid. There's a 2001, 2001 import (extra tracks), 2002, 2006 import, and 2008 import remastered. SHEESH. And the vinyl of course.\n\nLost Crowes has a version from 2006 on Rhino, and another one called \"original CD\" on Amazon by a label called \"PID\". Was this Rhino an Inglot mastered title?\n\nSouthern Companion has a 1992 and a 2007\n\nAmorica has a 1994, 2002, AND a 2007, not to mention the clean version and two vinyl pressings.\n\nThree Snakes has a 1996, 2002, and a 2007, and a 7\" 45rpm single set\n\nShake your money maker has a 1990, a 1998 (enhanced), a 2000, and a 2006\n\nThere are a lot of Crowes experts in this thread. Has anyone done the listening tests on these?\n\nccm\n\nI'd be curious to know about this too, as I'm about to fill in the gaps in my Crowes collection; which are the preferred versions?"
