        "text": "Albumdata\n\nArtist The Black Crowes Album $hake Your Money Maker Year of release 1990\n\nRating\n\nReview\n\nSome albums just don’t need too many words. $hake Your Money Maker is such an album. The Black Crowes started in 1984 as Mr. Crowe’s Garden and was founded by brothers Chris and Rich Robinson. In 1988, they were discovered by George Drakoulias, who offered them a deal with Def American Records. Shortly thereafter the band changes its name to The Black Crowes.\n\nDuring the summer of 1989 the band started recording their debut album, produced by Drakoulias. The band wrote all the music themselves, with the exception of a cover of Otis Redding’s Hard to Handle.\n\nThe album was released on February 13th, 1990, and was received quite well by the press, but the band was accused of lack of originality. Even though the music was deeply rooted in the (old) tradition of The Faces and The Rolling Stones, it still didn’t diminish the eagerness and fresh feel of the album’s music, which still sounds fresh today.\n\nBefore the year was over, the album had already sold 2 million copies (the current amount of units sold is around 5 million) in the US.\n\nIn 1990 no less than four singles were culled from $hake Your Money Maker, a rather unique feat for a debut album:\n\nJealous Again\n\nHard To Handle\n\nTwice As Hard\n\nShe Talks To Angels\n\nFor everyone who loves classic rock & roll, delivered with conviction and swagger: buy and/or listen to this album!\n\nSongs\n\nAll songs written by Chris & Rich Robinson, unless stated otherwise:\n\nTwice As Hard\n\nJealous Again\n\nSister Luck\n\nCould I’ve Been So Blind\n\nSeeing Things\n\nHard To Handle (written by Otis Redding, Allen Jones, Alvertis Isbell)\n\nThick n’ Thin\n\nShe Talks To Angels\n\nStruttin’ Blues\n\nStare It Cold\n\nLive Too Fast Blues/Mercy, Sweet Moan (hidden track)\n\nMusicians\n\nJeff Cease – guitar\n\nJohnny Colt – bass\n\nSteve Gorman – drums\n\nChris Robinson – vocals\n\nRich Robinson – guitar\n\nWith help from:\n\nLaura Creamer – background vocals\n\nChuck Leavell – piano, organ\n\nBrendan O’Brien – “a potpourri of instruments”\n\n2020 Tour\n\nAt the end of 2019 The Black Crowes announced a reunion. The upcoming tour was billed as The Black Crowes Present: $hake Your Money Maker Played In Its Entirety Plus All The Hits. I have tickets for the Amsterdam show in October 2020. I can’t wait!"
