        "text": "True to her Texas roots, Edie Brickell can seemingly find a song anywhereâincluding out of thin air.Â Here It ComesÂ is the new album from Edie and her collaborators, CJ Camerieri and Trever Hagen who are known as Heavy MakeUp.\n\nHeavy MakeUp is, of course, only the latest musical iteration for Edie whoâs found herself ever evolving over her career. From her first hit with the New Bohemians, co-writing their massive 1988 single âWhat I Am,â sheâs never stopped looking for songs. She even spent the better part of a decade writing and performing with Steve Martin on their very own musicalâBright Starâthat ran on Broadway in 2016.\n\nOn todayâs episode, Bruce Headlam talks with Edie, CJ and Trever about the origins of Heavy MakeUp and the recording of their new album. We'll also hear a short performance demonstrating the unique improvisational nature of their work.\n\nYou can hear a playlist of some of our favorite Edie Brickell songs HERE.\n\nSee omnystudio.com/listener for privacy information.\n\nLegends are made at the Olympics and this summer shows across the Pushkin network are bringing their unique takes to Olympic stories. This special episode includes excerpts from a few: a Cautionary Tale about underestimating female marathoners, a Jesse Owens story from Revisionist Historyâs series on Hitlerâs Olympics, andâfrom Whatâs Your Problemâthe new technology thatâs helping Olympic athletes get stronger.\n\nCheck out other show feeds as well, the Happiness Lab and A Slight Change of Plans are also going to the Games.\n\nSylvia Blemker of Springbok Analytics on Whatâs Your Problem\n\nThe Women Who Broke the Marathon Taboo on Cautionary Tales\n\nHitlerâs Olympics from Revisionist History\n\nSee omnystudio.com/listener for privacy information.\n\nShannon & The Clams were long time regulars in the Bay Area music scene. The bandâs two main songwritersâShannon Shaw and Cody Blanchard met in college in Oakland, California. They remained there for about a decade until a number of events set them adrift physically and spiritually.\n\nThe bandâs new album,Â The Moon Is In the Wrong Place, is taken from a phrase Shannonâs fiancÃ©, Joe Haener uttered shortly before his passing. Much of the album is anchored around Shannonâs grief. On today's episode Justin Richmond talks to Shannon Shaw and Cody Blanchard about moving away from Oakland, the aftermath of losing a loved one, and about their Dan Auerbach-produced album,Â The Moon Is In The Wrong Place.\n\nYou can hear a playlist from Shannon's late fiancÃ©, Joe Haener, HERE.\n\nSee omnystudio.com/listener for privacy information.\n\nRandy Bachman is the Canadian guitarist and songwriter behind a slew of hits with the bands The Guess Who and Bachman Turner Overdrive. Although he was based far from the '60s powerhouse music scenes of Laurel Canyon and Swinging London, Bachman first made a name for himself performing across the Great White North.\n\nOn todayâs episode Bruce Headlam talks to Randy who dissects his hits including âAmerican Womanâ and âThese Eyes.â He also explains how he became one of the great guitarists of his generation.\n\nYou can hear a playlist of some of our favorite Randy Bachman songs HERE.\n\nSee omnystudio.com/listener for privacy information.\n\nSerj Tankian made his first foray into public life as the idiosyncratic lead singer of the late â90s metal band System Of A Down. After releasing five platinum-selling albums with the band, and establishing himself as one of modern-day musicâs most outspoken human-rights activists, in 2007, Serj left System to pursue his own artistic pursuits. Since then heâs released solo albums, composed symphonies, scored documentaries, and most recently started producing a line of Armenian coffee.\n\nIn May, Serj also released a memoir called âDown With The Systemâ that details his personal story that starts in Beirut before his family emigrated to Los Angeles during the Lebanese Civil War in the â70s. Serjâs memoir also details his family's history in Armenia, and their chilling plight during the genocide of 1915.\n\nOn todayâs episode Leah Rose talks to Serj Tankian about why he always felt like an outsiderâincluding in System Of A Down. He also explains why it was so essential for him to exercise his demons on stage, and the one fundamental change that needs to take place in order for him to record new music with the band.\n\nYou can hear a playlist of some of our favorite Serj Tankian songs HERE.\n\nSee omnystudio.com/listener for privacy information.\n\nCamila Cabello is in the midst of a creative revival. Her brand new album,Â C,XOXOÂ was recently dubbed âhyper-popâ by Rolling Stone in the wake of the frenetic first single, âI Luv It,â featuring Playboi Carti. The track is an entirely new direction for Camila who first rose to fame in 2012 as a member of the girl group Fifth Harmony.\n\nOn her new album Camila is racing into uncharted territory with her sound. She enlisted producers Jasper Harris and El Guincho, whoâs known for his work with Rosalia. Together they introduce a variety of new sounds into Camilaâs orbit including the newest sounds in hip-hop. The result is Camilaâs edgiest album yet.\n\nToday Justin Richmond talks to Camila about the very particular set of creative influences that inspired her new album, including a book by Joan Didion. She also talks about having features from Drake on her album, why she wanted to make music for Miami Spring breakers.\n\nYou can hear a playlist of some of our favorite Camila Cabello songs HERE.\n\nSee omnystudio.com/listener for privacy information."
