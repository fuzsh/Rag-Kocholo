D+\n\nüëç\n\nView Author\n\n4\n\nThis album was a breath of fresh air in a period that had hard rock / hair metal being pushed aside by grunge. Along come the Robinson brothers with their blues-base true-rock record.\n\nüëç\n\nView Author\n\n5\n\nFantastic blues rock record. A classic.\n\nüëç\n\nView Author\n\n5\n\nThis was a very important album for me. I bought it right when it released and listened to it constantly. I also saw them on this tour, at a small club in Oakland called The Omni. Sadly, not around any more. They are an amazing live band. I've always loved how loose and bluesy this album is. It definitely deserves to be on this list.\n\nüëç\n\nView Author\n\n3\n\nI legitimately forgot this album and band existed. It's weird how some bands stick around in the Zeitgeist while others fade completely despite having similar track records. The album starts out really strong, but then the songs start to sound a bit samey. It's good, but it fades into the background because there's not a lot of tempo variation. There are some slower songs, but I can't say that I'm terribly impressed with songs like Seeing Things. Some of the other songs are good but start to feel like cultural appropriation (lookin at you, Hard to Handle. Talks to Angels is a good song that feels more original. 3/5\n\nüëç\n\nView Author\n\n5\n\n<3\n\nüëç\n\nView Author\n\n4\n\nThis album is full of typical bar rock. Southern band raised on the Stones, Humble Pie, and Otis Redding. Nice to listen to, sing along to, listen to while downing a few beers at your local watering hole, maybe gaining enough courage to go on stage and karaoke to one of these tunes. Mostly, this album could be indistinguishable from any other southern bar band album, although I do love Chris Robinson‚Äôs voice. The songs are familiar feeling in a way that made them feel like Insta-classics. Seeing Things is the bluesiest track. I love the song, but I don‚Äôt love Robinson singing it. The Otis Redding cover Hard to Handle fits his voice well and I recall it being a big hit. Thick n Thin is a swinging bop. She Talks to Angels has a special place in my heart forever, and this album gets a whole star just for that song alone. I‚Äôve both been that girl and I know that girl.

Some of their songs are superb in my opinion, and I think most of my favorite Black Crowes songs are on this album (e.g., Hard To Handle, She Talks To Angels, Jealous Again, Sister Luck, and more). I love the guitar work on this album but I never know if it's Rich Robinson or Jeff Cease I'm hearing when I'm admiring what I hear (like that real sweet bluesy lead in 'Sister Luck'). I know Jeff Cease is named lead guitarist for this album, so I'll give this another couple listens to see what I pick up (no, that's not meant as a guitar pun). I hadn't listened to this album in a very long time - probably decades - and, dang, it really holds up well. Love the rootsy-bluesy-gritty-rock-meets-gospel sounds. Chris Robinson is a really great singer. I would've loved to have seen them in concert when they toured to support this album.\n\nüëç\n\nView Author\n\n5\n\nNo need to skip any, very enjoyable.

Perhaps not every single track was perfect, but the first one hits so hard and there are lots of good ones scattered throughout the album. Not just the singles. So much so that I went looking for bonus tracks and other albums as soon as this was done and I never have energy for that. This is a keeper for life now.\n\nüëç\n\nView Author\n\n5\n\nFantastic! I didn't think I would like this album much, but I was proved very incorrect. It's a lot of fun. The drums are tight, the vocals are energetic, the guitars are rocking, I like it a lot. \"Hard to Handle\" is obviously the best known song of the album, but pretty much every song is good too. Very glad I heard it.\n\nüëç\n\nView Author\n\n5\n\nDefinitely on my list nowüí™üòéü§ò\n\nüëç\n\nView Author\n\n5\n\nThe Wolfmother paradox - the ability to imitate your influences with such perfection that the final product is devoid of any personality or imagination. What should be an oil painting becomes a blueprint. His mumbling and at times incoherent singing is actually kind of endearing to the point of hilarity, especially on Hard to Handle - so fun to sing along with. (also my album highlight, verging on perfect rock song). Five stars for making me think about it so much\n\nüëç\n\nView Author\n\n5\n\nReally surprised here. I have always loved the Black Crowes on the radio but I also always asked myself whether they were just a band with a bunch of good singles. I have never listened to any of their albums cover to cover. Even before I started listening to this album I looked at the track listing and thought whoa. That was the surprise - this album looked stacked. It did not disappoint. Big sound, lethal guitar work, heavy southern and blues rock (honkytonk piano to boot), great vocals. Turns out most of the songs I love from these guys (Twice as Hard, Jealous Again, Hard to Handle) are on this album. And if I ever get good enough to play guitar in front of people I will play She Talks to Angels - my singing also sucks but if I can pick & pluck my way through that song it won't matter. A true classic (can't believe Rich Robinson wrote that at 15). The non-hits were just as good (Sister Luck, Think N Thin, and Struttin Blues were particularly good). So I have my answer - they were amazing on one album. I still say they were largely average the rest of their career (second album was alright). But THIS album! A beauty.\n\nüëç\n\nView Author\n\n5\n\nThe Black Crowes are a band I drifted away from and then came back to (Stone Temple Pilots is another). Their hits really \"hit\" but their b-sides and album tracks are middling. But the first album is very solid. I recently picked up the anniversary edition (if you can, try to get the Target version. It is basically the music in the box set without all the extra crap, trinkets and tchotchkes.) It's funny how everyone assumes \"Hard To Handle\" was a Crowes original. I never understood why they couldn't play that one with Page (they couldn't do any Black Crowes material on that fantastic album they did because of recording rights, but \"H2H\" could have been done...?) Although my favorite track of theirs is not on here, this is a very good (if not great) album. Solid all the way through.\n\nüëç\n\nView Author\n\n5\n\nGood, solid, slammin' rock and roll! Kind of a surprise 5 stars for me. I knew I liked their songs that I'd heard before, but didn't realize they all came from the same album! Hard to Handle has been one of my favorite rock songs since their version hit. Jealous Again & Twice as Hard are nearly as good, with great edge, wonderful hooks and tight playing. She Talks to Angels show a bit of a softer side, but still packs a punch. Even the lesser songs on this album show off the strength of the ensemble, with the fantastic organ sounds bringing a feel of the best of The Band or Procol Harum. This album, simply, rocks and will be in my collection in regular rotation, esp. for road trips with the windows down!\n\nüëç\n\nView Author\n\n5\n\nHit after hit after hit after hit: Twice as Hard, Jealous Again, She Talks to Angels & the incomparable Hard to Handle.

We were coming off the hair-band era and needed some southern rock that everyone could get behind. I was never a big Chris R fan in the day, but his scoopy vocals really add character and grit to their otherwise clean sound. 4.0\n\nüëç\n\nView Author\n\n3\n\nI was too cool for this album when it came out but picked it up in the mid 2000s. Now it reminds me of Napster and bud light, both of which are gone from my life, but this album lives on.\n\nüëç\n\nView Author\n\n2\n\n‚ÄúThe Black Crowes are to the early Rolling Stones what Christian Slater is to the young Jack Nicholson: a self-conscious imitation, but fine enough in its own right.‚Äù\n\nüëç\n\nView Author\n\n2\n\nThis album was fine, but I don't have a ton to say about it. It was probably refreshing at the time to hear a throwback to music from the early 70's (got a lot of Led Zeppelin and Rolling Stones vibes from the Black Crowes) so I can see why it was successful; however, the band didn't seem to take many chances to make themselves unique within the blues-rock genre. Interestingly enough, I feel like this group could have really only succeeded in that very specific year of 1990: this probably was a breath of fresh air in the aftermath of 1980s synth and glam rock, but I feel it would come off as boring or date the following year when grunge and alternative took over the scene. Their biggest song, Hard to Handle, and the opening track, Twice as Hard, were the standout tracks to me upon the first listen, and while the rest of the songs are solid, they do kind of blend together by the end of the record. Not a bad album by any means, but it ultimately did not give me a reason to come back. 2.5/5.\n\nüëç\n\nView Author\n\n2\n\nI had no idea the sound recording in town halls could be so good. Who's responsible for capturing this 70's country-rock tribute act? Where was it recorded? Has anyone tracked down members of the audience to get their take on this historic moment? Surely these aren't originals. Not in 1990.\n\nüëç\n\nView Author\n\n2\n\nIt's a generic early 90's hard rock album with 60's rock influence. The old school influences aren't enough to set it apart, in my opinion.

Apart from the many hits, I‚Äôm also a fan of the guitars on ‚ÄúSister Luck‚Äù. Songwriting is really good throughout - especially on ‚ÄúShe Talks to Angels‚Äù.

Jealous Again was good as well, I like the inclusion of the sort of jazzy piano on this song. Sister Luck you can definitely hear the ‚Äúcountry‚Äù coming through a bit, not in a bad way, but it somewhat reminds me of Lynyrd Skynyrd. Could I‚Äôve Been So Blind was again liked, nothing new to say, same reasons as before. Seeing Things was very reminiscent of Muse‚Äôs ‚ÄúFalling Down‚Äù, the sort of soft country, I really like it. Hard To Handle is somewhat familiar, very good, feels a but Led Zeppelin, mot much but a wee bit, has that classic rock feel. Thick ‚ÄòN‚Äô Thin was really enjoyable, made me want to move, really liked the guitar work. She Talks To Angels was a nice acoustic ballad, literally the only gripe is the tuning meaning I can‚Äôt learn it. Struttin‚Äô Blues again, highly enjoyable, would love to learn all this stuff but nothing is in a normal tuning. Stare It Cold I would argue was the worst song on the album, and I still really enjoyed it.
