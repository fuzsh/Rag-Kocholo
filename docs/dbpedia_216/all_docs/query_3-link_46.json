        "text": "In Monterey, Calif., late on Friday, Mercedes-Benz unveiled its latest concept car, the EQ Silver Arrow. It’s an homage to the brand’s original W 125 race car, which in 1937 set the record for fastest land-speed vehicle on a public road by traveling nearly 270 miles per hour. That record was only broken late last year by the Koenigsegg Agera.\n\nThe electric one-seater joins a long list of memorable concepts that Mercedes shows off every year in advance of the Pebble Beach Concours d’Elegance on Sunday. None of them will reach anything near production, but design chief Gorden Wagener says they’re useful to illustrate how the brand’s future will look, embodied in one car."
