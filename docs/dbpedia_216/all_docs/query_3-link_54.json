        "text": "Fall training has been started around the world in clubs and schools. in some other geographical areas (e.g. Australia) season just kicked off. Teachers, coaches and competitors are looking out for the best javelin deals from worldwide brands. So, the questions comes that ‘ What sorts of javelin brand shell I choose, and for the best price/quality what would I end up buying? What are the main brands besides Nordic, Nemeth, Polanik, OTE, Apollo, Getra, Astro, Alloy, Conqueror, Winex, Speerwerx? The answer comes from China, the SILVER AROOW brand.\n\nSilver Arrow javelin brand has been around for many years. Who would choose their javelin lines?\n\nThe Silver Arrow javelin are made at Metals Javelin Factory Of Dingzhou, in Hebei, China (Mainland). The manufacturer and traiding compnay has been around since 1994. The javelin made in all ranges from 400gr to 800gr are also allowed in international competition certified by IAAF. Nordic Javelin Group is closely watching Silver Javelin lines (Köln/Germany 2017 Fall Sport Expo), since their javelins are very much look alike with Nordic Carbon javelins. Be aware that the Silver Javelins are made mostly of aluminium.\n\nIn some sites, such as Alibaba, we can read that the company can assure 5000 javelins per month sales, so anyone in almost anytime can buy javelins for a whole community!!\n\nAlthough most of the javelins are made for educational purposes, the company may target the high-end level aluminimum and carbon javelins in the future. If anyone wants to buy the branded javelin, they should visit their local sports-equipment dealer and see whether the quality is suitable for the intended training sessions."
