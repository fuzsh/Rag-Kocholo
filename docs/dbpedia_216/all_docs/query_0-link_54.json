        "text": "JED GOTTLIEB\n\nThose geezers who think new music is terrible don’t listen to new music. To those who say rock ’n’ roll peaked in 1967, I say it plateaued. Rock’s renewed itself year after year. 2009 was no different.\n\n1. A.C. Newman, “Get Guilty” (Matador)\n\n2. Avett Brothers, “I and Love and You” (American)\n\n3. Passion Pit, “Manners” (Columbia)\n\n4. New York Dolls, “’Cause I Sez So” (Atco)\n\n5. Neko Case, “Middle Cyclone” (Anti)\n\n6. Phoenix, “Wolfgang Amadeus Phoenix” (V2)\n\n7. The Low Anthem, “Oh My God, Charlie Darwin” (Nonesuch)\n\n8. Mike Doughty, “Sad Man, Happy Man” (ATO)\n\n9. Wheat, “White Ink, Black Ink” (Rebel)\n\n10. Wilco, “Wilco (The Album)” (Nonesuch)\n\nMARTIN CABALLERO\n\nThe fact that seven of this year’s best albums (according to me) are debut releases should tell you something. First, that a new crop of Boston-based artists have created some of the year’s most enduring works, from progressive pop (Passion Pit, Chester French) to nuanced and evocative hip-hop (Will C., BoyCott Blues). Second, that these acts will have a tough time living up to future expectations.\n\n1. N.A.S.A., “The Spirit of Apollo” (Anti)\n\n2. Lee Fields & the Expressions, “My World” (Truth & Soul)\n\n3. Raekwon, “Only Built 4 Cuban Linx … Pt. II” (Ice H2O/EMI)\n\n4. Passion Pit, “Manners” (Frenchkiss)\n\n5. BoyCott Blues, “Irony” (Brick)\n\n6. Mos Def, “The Ecstatic” (Downtown)\n\n7. Will C., “Evil in the Mirror” (Brick)\n\n8. Mayer Hawthorne, “A Strange Arrangement” (Stones Throw)\n\n9. Wale, “Attention: Deficit” Allido/Interscope)\n\n10. Chester French, “Love the Future” (Star Trak)\n\nBonus pick: Edo G & Masta Ace, “Little Young” music video\n\nMICHAEL MAROTTA\n\nWe’re living in the iPod generation, so it’s fitting that 2009 was a year of the individual song. Not many albums held my attention longer than a month, but I can come up with one awesome synthpop-electro-pop-rock playlist:\n\n1. Lady Gaga, “Bad Romance” (Streamline/Konlive/Cherrytree/Interscope)\n\n2. Passion Pit, “Little Secrets” (Columbia/DMZ)\n\n3. Amazing Baby, “Headdress” (Artist First)\n\n4. Lies in Disguise, “Meet Your Replacement” (Always Never/So Sweet)\n\n5. Yes Giantess, “Demons” (Self-released/tour EP)\n\n6. We Were Promised Jetpacks, “Quiet Little Voices” (Fat Cat)\n\n7. Little Boots, “Remedy” (Warner, import)\n\n8. The Big Pink, “Velvet” (4AD)\n\n9. Yeah Yeah Yeahs, “Zero” (Interscope)\n\n10. Phoenix, “1901” (Glass Note)\n\nBonus picks: Passion Pit’s “Manners”; Canadian electro-pop singer Lights; every single thing about Lady Gaga\n\nJIM SULLIVAN\n\nNever does it get more subjective than when writers choose the 10 best of anything. What follows are ones that caught my attention, held on and stood their ground.\n\n1. The Decemberists, “The Hazards of Love” (Capitol)\n\n2. The Cribs, “Ignore the Ignorant” (Warner Bros.)\n\n3. Grizzly Bear, “Veckatimest” (Warp)\n\n4. Flaming Lips, “Embryonic” (Warner Bros.)\n\n5. Phoenix, “Wolfgang Amadeus Phoenix” (Glass Note)\n\n6. Lady Gaga, “The Fame Monster” (Streamline/Konlive/Cherrytree/Interscope)\n\n7. Green Day, “21st Century Breakdown” (Reprise)\n\n8. Yo La Tengo, “Popular Songs” (Matador)\n\n9. Rosanne Cash, “The List” (Manhattan)\n\n10. Antony & the Johnsons, “The Crying Light” (Secretly Canadian)\n\nBonus picks: Nick Hornby, “Juliet, Naked” (novel, Riverhead); Roxy Music, “The Story of Roxy Music” (DVD, Eagle Rock); the Beatles, “The Original Recordings” (CD boxed sets, stereo and mono, Capitol).\n\nLAUREN CARTER\n\nThe No. 1 spot is reserved for Enya’s greatest hits. There are no new tracks on the Irish singer’s collection and none are needed. This compilation of the best work is a virtual deep-tissue massage for the soul.\n\n1. Enya, “The Very Best of Enya” (Reprise/Warner Bros.)\n\n2. Jay-Z, “The Blueprint 3” (Roc Nation)\n\n3. Stevie Nicks, “The Soundstage Sessions: Live in Chicago” CD/DVD (Reprise/Warner Bros.)\n\n4. Millyz, “Whiteboy Like Me” (independent)\n\n5. The-Dream, “Love vs. Money” (Def Jam)\n\n6. Mariah Carey, “Memoirs of an Imperfect Angel” (Island)\n\n7. Keri Hilson, “In a Perfect World” (Interscope)\n\n8. Lady Gaga, “The Fame Monster” deluxe edition (Streamline/Konlive/Cherrytree/Interscope)\n\n9. Chris Brown, “Graffiti” (Jive)\n\n10. 50 Cent, “Flight 187” single and video (Shady/Aftermath/Interscope)\n\nBRETT MILANO\n\nNever mind the radio, there’s still plenty of food out there for eclectic tastes, including Boston vets making their best album ever (No. 3), grunge vets with their first truly great one (No. 8) and garage rock mania (No. 9). And the winner: a brilliant art-rock concept album on a major label by a band that’s actually popular.\n\n1. The Decemberists, “The Hazards of Love” (Capitol)\n\n2. The Radiators, “Wild & Free” (Radz)\n\n3. Mission of Burma, “The Sound The Speed The Light” ( Matador)\n\n4. The Soundtrack of Our Lives, “Communion” (Yep Roc)\n\n5. The Fiery Furnaces, “I’m Going Away” (Thrill Jockey)\n\n6. Peter Holsapple and Chris Stamey, “Here and Now” (Bar/None)\n\n7. Transatlantic, “The Whirlwind” (Metal Blade)\n\n8. Pearl Jam, “Backspacer” (Monkeywrench)\n\n9. The Condo F***s, “F***book” (Matador)\n\n10. Robyn Hitchcock & the Venus 3, “Goodnight Oslo” (Yep Roc)\n\nBOB YOUNG\n\nA common thread is that many of the following artists have either trained in Boston, cut their teeth here,, stopped in on tour in 2009 or call the Hub home. While Boston may still be only a pit stop for some, there’s enough inspiration in the air to make it around the globe.\n\n1. Marta Gomez, “Musiquita” (Aluna)\n\n2. Beat Circus, “Boy From Black Mountain” (Cuneiform)\n\n3. Nando Michelin, “Reencontro”\n\n4. Tom Harrell, “Prana Dance” (HighNote)\n\n5. Kailash Kher & Kailasa, “Yatra (Nomadic Souls)” (Cumbancha)\n\n6. John Funkhouser Trio, “Time”\n\n7. Booker T., “Potato Hole” (Anti)\n\n8. Gypsy Schaeffer, “New Album” (Peace Time)\n\n9. CuCu Diamantes, “CuCuland” (Fun Machine)\n\n10. Vanessa da Mata, “Sim” (Sony BMG)\n\nDAVE WEDGE\n\nAnother monster year in metal, especially for Massachusetts acts, five of which made this list for carrying the region’s headbanging torch with reckless abandon.\n\n1. Slayer, “World Painted Blood” (Sony)\n\n2. Isis, “Wavering Radiant” (Ipecac)\n\n3. Mastodon, “Crack the Skye” (Reprise)\n\n4. Lamb of God, “Wrath” (Sony)\n\n5. Killswitch Engage, “Killswitch Engage” (Roadrunner)\n\n6. Converge, “Axe to Fall” (Epitaph)\n\n7. Shadows Fall, “Retribution” (Everblack Industries/Ferret)\n\n8. Devil Driver, “Pray for Villains” (Roadrunner)\n\n9. The Red Chord, “Fed Through the Teeth Machine” (Metal Blade)\n\n10. Megadeth, “Endgame” (Roadrunner)\n\nBonus picks: Chuck Mosley’s “Tractor”; Ladyhawke’s “My Delirium” (Fan Death Remix); Street Sweeper Social Club’s “The Oath”\n\nDANIEL GEWERTZ\n\nThe finest roots and folk music CDs of 2009 were found on indie labels, but in these economically cautious times even small labels weren’t taking chances on unknowns. With artists who don’t already have a flourishing career and several thousand friends on Facebook, self-release was the way to go.\n\n1. Willie Nelson and Asleep at the Wheel, “Willie and the Wheel” (Bismeaux)\n\n2. Geoff Muldaur, “Texas Sheiks” (Tradition & Moderne)\n\n3. The Greencards, “Fascination” (Sugar Hill)\n\n4. Jesse Winchester, “Love Filling Station” (Appleseed)\n\n5. The Wailin’ Jennys, “Live at Mauch Chunk Opera House” (Red House)\n\n6.

Dave Rawlings Machine, “A Friend of a Friend” (Acony)\n\n10. Booka and the Flaming Geckos, “Baghdad Texas” soundtrack (Loudhouse)\n\nBonus picks: Boxed set: Woody Guthrie, “My Dusty Road” (Rounder). DVD: “Joan Baez: How Sweet the Sound” (Razor & Tie/American Masters). Political country song: Angela Easterling, “The Picture” (De L’Est)\n\nBILL BROTHERTON\n\nYoung ladies from the British Isles, old English dudes and gi- and-boy duets ruled in 2009.\n\n1. Bell X1, “Blue Lights on the Runway” (Yep Roc)\n\n2. Madness, “The Liberty of Norton Folgate” (Yep Roc)\n\n3. The Raveonettes, “In and Out of Control” (Vice)\n\n4. Gabriella Cilmi, “Lessons to be Learned” (Republic)\n\n5. Jack Penate, “Everything is New” (XL)\n\n6. Little Boots, “Hands” (Warner Bros./AIS)\n\n7. The Black Crowes, “Before the Frost…Until the Freeze” (Silver Arrow/Angelus)\n\n8. The Low Anthem, “Oh My God, Charlie Darwin” (Nonesuch)\n\n9. Polly Scattergood, “Polly Scattergood” (Mute)\n\n10. Laura Izibor, “Let the Truth Be Told” (Atlantic)\n\nBonus picks: Boxed sets: Richard Thompson, “Walking on a Wire: 1968-2009” (Shout Factory); The Kinks, “Picture Book” (Sanctuary); Nick Lowe, “The Brentford Trilogy” (Yep Roc). Singles: The Golden Filter’s “Solid Gold” and “Lay It Down” (online only).\n\nBARRY THOMPSON\n\nI probably listened to Jay Reatard more than anything else in ’09, but a lot of incredible rock ’n’ roll came out this year. People who presume nothing worthwhile has happened since the ’90s need to get with the program.\n\n1. Jay Reatard, “Watch Me Fall” (Matador)\n\n2. Beat Circus, “Boy From Black Mountain” (Cuneiform)\n\n3. The Everyday Visuals, “The Everyday Visuals” (self-released)\n\n4. A Place to Bury Strangers, “Exploding Head” (Mute)\n\n5. Metric, “Fantasies” (Metric Music International)\n\n6. The Swaggerin’ Growlers, “Keep Your Head Held High” (Thugly Goose)\n\n7. Super Time Pilot, “Did we Happen to Begin?” (Open E)\n\n8. Screaming Females, “Power Move” (Don Giovanni)\n\n9. Bomb the Music Industry, “Scrambles” (Quote Unquote)\n\n10. AFI, “Crash Love” (Interscope)\n\nBonus picks: Have Nots, “Serf City U.S.A.” (self-released); MEandJOANCOLLINS, “Love. Trust. Faith. Lust.” (self-released)\n\nKEITH POWERS\n\nThis year’s most unusual gem was “Les Urnes de L’Opera,” a time capsule recording buried underneath the Paris Opera on Dec. 24, 1907, and unearthed this year. Actual performances of Kreisler, Caruso, Tetrazzini, Paderewsky, Nellie Melba and many others. Lo-fi treasure.\n\n1. Various artists, “Les Urnes de L’Opera” (EMI Classics)\n\n2. Gidon Kremer and Kremerata Baltica, “Mozart: The Complete Violin Concertos” (Nonesuch)\n\n3. Alarm Will Sound, “a/rhythmia” (Nonesuch)\n\n4.
