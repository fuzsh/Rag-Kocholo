        "text": "What does it sound like?:\n\nGeorge Drakoulias is responsible for much of The Black Crowes’ sound and their early success. He signed The Black Crowes to a new, Rock orientated label, Rick Rubin’s Def American Recordings, and produced their breakthrough albums. Hearing a texture of Rod Stewart in Chris Robinson’s voice, he introduced the band to the music of The Faces and Humble Pie and persuaded them to cover Rolling Stones’ songs. Their debut was released in 1990 just as Grunge galvanised the Rock market and sold five million copies in the USA within two years. The pressure was on for a follow up. The core band of Chris Robinson, vocals, brother Rich, guitar, Johnny Colt, bass, and Steve Gorman, drums, was supplement by two new members, Marc Ford, guitar, and Eddie Harsch, plus female backing singers, Barbara Mitchell and Taj Harmon. The album was recorded in eight days.\n\nThe sepia toned cover art, echoing The Band, promises a return to roots rock. The title reminds us that The Black Crowes are originally from Georgia. The Southern Harmony is an annotated hymn book, compiled by William Walker in 1835, that was often the only exposure people had to written music. It’s a shame, therefore, that there is nothing of real substance here. Thirty years on, this album, always verging on pastiche, has not aged well. It is charmless all the way through, a rigid 4/4, even when attempting a slow blues. There is little musicality, no decent riffs and the lyrics fail to capture the imagination. The voice has none of the artistry of Rod, the guitar is basic Ronnie Wood, there is no Keef swagger, no Charlie roll and nothing of the McLagan cheek. The girls’ backing could be transferred from one song to another without anyone noticing. It’s as though Drakoulias and the boys took seventies Rock apart, polished all the pieces, put them back together and lost its essence. The lack of progress from the debut is illustrated by the covers. Otis Redding’s Hard To Handle to Bob Marley’s Time Will Tell is a move from soulless to heartless. Nevertheless, back in 1992, when radio and TV were the main ways to hear new music, there was clearly an appetite for Rock, even in facsimile, as it shifted two million copies in America. The Robinsons have managed to lucratively plough this same furrow for many years.These days, the actual Faces and Stones are just the click of a button away on streaming platforms.\n\nA three CD super deluxe box includes the album on disc one, just nine outtakes and B sides on disc two and ten songs from a sixteen song live set in Houston, February 1993 on disc three. There is a hymn book, sheet music and four lithographs of the brothers, often with their shirts off. A two CD version has a nine track “best of the box” on the second disc, cynically excluding the one sought after rarity, a studio version of Misery. There is a four LP equivalent of the box and you can buy just the remastered single vinyl. Both Super Deluxe editions are expensive. The feeling of being short-changed is palpable. There is plenty of room on CD to please fans with more. The Black Crowes are much more dynamic and convincing treading the boards. Why not the full live set? In the UK, there were two CD singles with six acoustic numbers recorded at Ronnie Scott’s as B sides. They would have been most welcome here.\n\n.\n\nWhat does it all *mean*?\n\nA reissue that is unlikely to win new fans and may well lose some old ones.\n\nGoes well with…\n\nMoney to burn.\n\nRelease Date:\n\nOut now\n\nMight suit people who like…\n\nRetreads"
