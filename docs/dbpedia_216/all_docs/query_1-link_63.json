        "text": "Shake Your Money Maker, but there are things I like on any Crowes album. It was great to have a real rock 'n' roll band getting that much exposure at the time. They've sometimes since gone way too far down the jam band rabbit hole for my tastes, but the debut still shines after all these years.\n\nThanks, hopefully its better than this one?\n\nhttp://www.amazon.com/Southern-Harmony-Musical-Companion-Vinyl/dp/B001WIH1JC/ref=sr_1_2?s=music&ie=UTF8&qid=1371331627&sr=1-2&keywords=black crowes southern harmony and musical companion\n\nWhat label is the one your talking about on? I'm assuming the Def America is the one to go for correct?\n\nTo me the first one, Shake Your Money Maker, i remember when it came out, actually it hit big a year later with the release of Hard to handle, this album is full of boogie, good time rock n' roll, lot of Stones influences on them, nice acoustic ballads, nice rockers. The sound of the guitars i like a lot, Chris's swagger, everything. One of my holy grails to get a nice copy on vinyl, still haven't got it, have it on CD. Needs a proper reissue. The Southern Harmony to me gets a close second, great overall album, better musically that the fist one.\n\nI feel like they were way more popular in the 90s, and because of that a lot of people haven't heard warpaint or before the frost.\n\nThose two records are fantastic, and I highly recommend them. Their return brought with it a larger influence from Americana type bands, and i think that really rounded their sound out.\n\nWarpaint is a good mix of zeppelin like blues stompers with more mellow stuff, but is definitely more of a rocker.\n\nBefore the frost is my favorite, on vinyl! The track order is completely different, and it flows way better as a two lp set. You really have to burn a cd version with the vinyl track order to get this record if you don't have the vinyl\n\nThis album was cut live in Levon helm's barn and has a wide range of great material. It is definitely one of my favorites from the 2000's\n\nSouthern Harmony, and then Amorica are \"best,\" in the sense of artistic achievement.\n\nBy Your Side gets just as much airtime for me though, even though I realize it's not the pinnacle of their career or anything. Rockin', tight, and focused...for the last time in their career as far as studio LP's go.\n\nI'm actually surprised Amorica is 3rd in this poll so far. \"Gone\" is such a rowdy launch-- it's a statement, \"Conspiracy\" is a bit of a pop number-- \"Remedy\" light, if you will. \"High Head Blues\" is just an awesome Santana-like rocker with great twists and a surprising power chorus. \"Cursed Diamond\" is their greatest song-- for me. \"Nonfiction\" is gorgeous-- \"Clouds conspire, above my head...\" is a great visual. \"She Gave Good Sunflower\" is a stompin' southern rocker. The dueling guitars are insane, and I love the Billy Preston keyboard. \"P. 25 London\" is the turkey on this record. \"Ballad In Urgency/Wiser Time\" is what makes the record a masterpiece. \"Downtown Money Waster\"- the steel slide is just incredible-- a real honkey tonk blues number the Stones would envy. \"Descending\" is a worthy slow ballad-- though not up to \"Thorn In My Pride\".\n\nThe guitar work to me is what makes this record so interesting. On a pair of headphones, the left guitar lead riffs are played straight, the right channel doubles them-- but with a much looser feel, almost soloing through entire songs. At other times the left goes in harmony with the left a bit like the Allman Brothers.\n\nThat's why I think it's their best.\n\nI voted for Southern Harmony (so did the majority I see) and can be lumped in with the Southern Harmony first with Amorica a close second gang. I like the debut as well, but they lost me with the 'Heroin Chic' of Three Snakes which Ibought when it came out in the 7 inch box set form and have rarely spun.\n\nI found the rest of their records boring and uninspired until they regrouped a few years back and released Before The Frost--saw them live finally two times around then--awesome. But what I really loved was the two CRB shows I saw a year or two ago in May in SLO. Bloody brilliant shows they were, a great band, Chris in the groove.\n\nLoving Neil Casal's \"Mountains of the Moon\" 45 these days and hoping that CRB is not dead forever.\n\nBut back to TBC's best, Southern Harmony, what a beautiful record, I'm so glad I paid the high price for the Import vinyl when it came out back in 1991-2, one of my most cherished records.\n\nThree Snakes is my personal favorite. I just think it perfectly captures a mood better than any of the other albums. You can really feel the relationships that were falling apart at the time.\n\nAmorica and Southern Harmony are both terrific rock records, and probably tie for second in my book. After that, it would be Before the Frost, Shake your Money Maker, Warpaint, By Your Side, and finally Lions. I never really got into Lions as an album, though it has some terrific songs. BYS would be higher if I didn't find the lyrics so boring."
