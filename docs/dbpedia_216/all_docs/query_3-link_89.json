It wasn't a Silver Arrow Edition, but the car was perfect in every respect and I was shocked how much the car had depreciated in 8 years. I didn't hold onto the car very long since the curb weight (2,000+ kilos!) really hampered performance. Nevertheless, they're great cars, \"pretty reliable\" and enjoyable for what they are. Here's a pic of my car:\n\nAttachments\n\nSL500 11.JPG\n\nThe early ones with the m119 are the best, although I'm biased since I own a 92. I like the original-run look from 90-93 as well. Normal issues of any V8 MB of its day, plus top hydraulic$. I was looking at a 95 E320 cab when I bought mine, only because it was that nice - original paint, 2 owners, all records, hydraulics replaced - and I paid $8k and have still put $4k into it getting it \"perfect.\"\n\nI think a 129SL is a great addition to any MB collection, although I'm still saving for my 500E, and if I buy another SL it will be a 40th ann with the pano hardtop. A 2002 silver arrow would also be very collectible, I would think, whereas mine won't be as much so, although in another 20 years, a 40yo \"survivor\" with original paint and an m119 could command a few bucks.\n\nI think if one is looking for shorter-term appreciation, a 1988 or 1989 560SL with under 50K miles, original paint, etc. would be the way to go. They are way over $20K and some of the nicer ones in good color combos and from good climates are nosing up to the $30K level and beyond. No top hydraulic$ issues with the R107, either. I do realize that the styling is not to some folks' taste, and it's certainly not as \"sporty\" as the R129. But the later 107s are solidly heading upward in value, so would be a nice investment (buy it, drive it for free, and sell it for a profit) if you plan to hang onto it for a few years.\n\nCheers,\n\nGerry\n\nDid you get the car? 20 grand is a fine price IMO.\n\nIf any R129 will appreciate...it will be the Silver Arrows (and the 40th Anniversary Editions). But don't look at them as 'investment' cars. Maybe in 20 years tho; who knows? They're pretty good cars; even tho most of the MB fleet was Chrysler-ized by then; the 129 still remained a mostly solid build for them right up to the end.\n\nA couple used ones have been thru the dealer here and there are , no lie, 8 Silver Arrows just in the CT MB Club; all low miles....and all exactly the same. I'd prefer a MY 96-98' M119 myself over an earlier one...but I would love an early front bumper cover on that later model.\n\nLeave the 107s to the retired folk !! (insert poke emoticon here ) There has to be hundreds of them cris crafts with tires in our club. Great cars...they were in production for 25 or so years and made more than a quarter million of them; MB certainly hit the nail of the head with that model. And with all the original owners crossing that rainbow bridge or going into assisted living, the market is sure full of nice used ones to choose from.\n\nDid you get the car? 20 grand is a fine price IMO.\n\nIf any R129 will appreciate...it will be the Silver Arrows (and the 40th Anniversary Editions). But don't look at them as 'investment' cars. Maybe in 20 years tho\n\nI think they will all appreciate in 20 years, as does pretty much any MB convertible around age 40. The exquisitely-maintained \"special editions\" will command the highest dollar though. 90-93s are at rock bottom now, and it sounds like some later vintages aren't too far behind.\n\nThere were fewer 96-97 models than prior years, so that may be something to consider as far as investment. Also, color combos are important. Again, I was looking at a polar white on gray E320 cab, but when I saw the polar white on java/chocolate top SL beside it, the color combo completely killed that of the gray interior/black top of the E-cab, and I bought it. The car gets nothing but raves and stares anytime I park it. I doubt the same would happen with a white on gray, white on blue, etc.\n\n129s were highly-produced, so the ones that will really appreciate are low-mileage museum pieces, special models, rare/striking color combos, all-original survivors with no accidents, full documentation, etc, and lower-prod years - probably in that order$\n\n80% of what's out there in another 10 years will be resprays, failed tops, accidents, ripped interiors - so be in the top 20%\n\nGreat cars...they were in production for 25 or so years and made more than a quarter million of them; MB certainly hit the nail of the head with that model. And with all the original owners crossing that rainbow bridge or going into assisted living, the market is sure full of nice used ones to choose from.\n\n18 years to be exact (the 107 and the Grand 600 share the longest MB single model production record, unless you count the G-Wagen....). Indeed there are LOTS of 107s out there to choose from. Just depends on what color, mileage level and climate you want one from. I expect the R129s will follow suit, but it's going to be a long wait is all.\n\nMy advice is to just buy a nice driver, enjoy & drive the hell out of it, and when the time comes, trade it in for an investment-grade keeper !!"
