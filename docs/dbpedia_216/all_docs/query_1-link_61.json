        "text": "The Black Crowes have announced their first new album of original material in 15 years. The LP, titled Happiness Bastards, will arrive on March 15th via the band’s own Silver Arrow Records. In advance of the set, they’ve released a new song “Wanting and Waiting” (listen below).\n\nHappiness Bastards marks The Black Crowes’ first album of completely original material since 2009’s Before the Frost…Until the Freeze. Between studio albums, the band released 1972 in 2022, a collection of cover songs.\n\nBrothers Chris and Rich Robinson reunited The Black Crowes in 2019, and 2024 marks the 40th anniversary of the band’s start.\n\n“The Robinson Brothers are claiming this momentous year as their own,” a press release states. “Following decades marked by sex, drugs, fights, breakups, and divorce, they are leaving their bulls**t behind. While they have dealt with their share of differences over the years, they are now two happy bastards, with a triumphant album to show for it.”\n\nRelated Video\n\nChris added, “Happiness Bastards is our love letter to rock n’ roll. Rich and I are always writing and creating music; that has never stopped for us, and it is always where we find harmony together. This record represents that.”\n\nRich continued, “This album is a continuation of our story as a band. Our years of experience writing and making music and touring the world are represented in this record, and we were brilliantly guided by one of the best producers in the business, Jay Joyce. I am incredibly proud of what we put together.”\n\nSpeaking about the band’s reunion, Rich told Rolling Stone, “I wouldn’t say we had to repair our writing relationship, because that was never an issue. That was always the one natural thing, with very little volatility — when we would sit down to write, for whatever reason. Everything else was just making the decision to be adults, and not fall back into those sort of old patterns. But us getting back together and being cool and just getting it to that place lifts everything up.”\n\nA press release also teases new tour dates in “North America, the U.K., and Europe,” with “additional details to be announced soon.” The Black Crowes had been slated to open for Aerosmith on the latter’s farewell outing, but that tour was halted a few shows in due to Steven Tyler’s vocal cord injury.\n\nListen to “Wanting and Waiting” below, and view the album’s artwork and tracklist.
