        "text": "The Silver Arrow (also known as Herne's Arrow) was a magical artifact. The item was in the shape of a stylized metal arrow. [1]\n\nHistory[]\n\nBefore the Saxon rebellion, Herne the Hunter contacted Ailric of Loxley, Robin of Loxley's father, and offered him the role of the Hooded Man. Ailric agreed, and Herne gifted Ailric the Silver Arrow, a symbol recognised by many Saxons.[2] Ailric used the Silver Arrow as a rallying point during the rebellion.[2] Ailric later took the Arrow to Rhiannon's Wheel after placing his son with the miller. On arriving at the Wheel, Ailric was ambushed by Robert de Rainault, the Sheriff of Nottingham, who claimed Ailric was \"the Guardian\" of the Arrow, and demanded that Ailric yield him the Arrow. When Ailric refused, he was killed by de Rainault's Norman soldiers. De Rainault then seized the Arrow.[1]\n\nThe Sheriff subsequently showed the Arrow to his brother, Abbot Hugo de Rainault. Robert knew a great deal about the Arrow. He claimed it had been described by Gildas the Monk, about \"five hundred years ago, but it’s even older than that. Much older\".[1] The Sheriff said that Ailric had been the \"Guardian of the Arrow\". The Sheriff also said the Arrow was also known as \"Herne's Arrow\", and described it as a \"cult object, Like a sceptre or a cross\" and added he could not read the runes on the Arrow.[1]\n\nThe Sheriff subsequently held an archery competition, hoping to trap Robin Hood by offering the Silver Arrow as the prize. Prior to the contest, the Sheriff told his brother that the Arrow was \"a secret symbol of England.\"[1] Simon de Belleme, who also desired the Silver Arrow, attended the contest and had his servant enter. Robin of Loxley entered the contest in disguise, won the Silver Arrow, and escaped with the Arrow after being discovered.[1] Robin offered the Arrow to Herne, but Herne told him to retain it, saying \"The Arrow is your protection.\"[1]\n\nRobin took the Silver Arrow with him when he went to Castle Belleme. He hid the Arrow in his clothing. Belleme hypnotised Robin and ordered him to kill Marion with a knife. However, the Silver Arrow materialised in Robin's hands instead of the knife. Robin used the Arrow to kill de Belleme and rescue Marion.[1]\n\nAfter the events of Robin Hood and the Sorcerer, Robin returned the Arrow to Herne, who kept it stored in his cave.[3] When Robin was placed under a spell by the witch Lilith, she made Robin steal the Arrow from a box in Herne's cave. Lilith brought Robin and the Arrow to Castle Belleme, where she showed Robin the preserved body of of de Belleme. Lilith used the Arrow as part of a black magic ritual to restore de Belleme to life.[3] Robin escaped from Lilith's spell, and returned to the Castle to retrieve the Arrow. De Belleme attempted to kill Robin by magically paralyzing him and then launching the Arrow at Robin. However, Herne materialized next to Robin. Herne snatched the Arrow out of the air and saved Robin's life.[3]\n\nRobin of Loxley later visited Herne in his cave, when Herne gave Robin the Arrow to hold. Herne explained that when the Silver Arrow was held in a person's hand, \"the connection with the Otherworld is stronger\", and that the Arrow thus allowed him or her to speak with the spirits of the dead.[2] Under Herne's guidance, Robin was able to use the Arrow to communicate with the ghost of his father Ailric. [2]\n\nFurther Notes[]\n\nIn the novelisation Robin of Sherwood, it is mentioned about the men taking part in the Sheriff's archery contest for the Silver Arrow: \"A few of them knew it was Herne's Arrow and were angry that such a sacred symbol should have fallen into the hands of their conquerors\".\n\nOn the DVD commentary for Robin Hood and the Sorcerer, Richard Carpenter said the Silver Arrow was based on the \"Golden Arrow\" traditionally offered as a reward for archery competitions in the Robin Hood legends. Carpenter said he changed the metal of the Arrow from gold to silver because in folklore, silver is associated with occultism and the Moon. [4]\n\nIn the liner notes for the Clannad album Legend, there is the following information about the Arrow in the \"Robin of Loxley\" section:\"Ailric of Loxley, Guardian of the Arrow, ancient symbol of pre-Christian England, has led a rebellion against his Anglo-Norman masters. When Ailric is murdered by Norman pillagers, his son Robin (Michael Praed) is adopted by the local miller and the Arrow falls into the hands of the Sheriff of Nottingham.\""
