        "text": "Steven P. Wheeler giveth, and Steven P. Wheeler taketh away.\n\nThat is the story of The Red Devils in the Oct. 12, 1992, edition of Music Connection, a radio and music industry trade magazine (and, today, a website). The Devils’ signing to Def American was a big deal in 1991/92, and the magazine found space for the band in its “First Artists” feature (“Focus on debut talent”) in a story by Wheeler.\n\nOnce again, Lester Butler has the duty of being interviewed; his quotes are the usual mix of hipster brilliance and goofy tangents that Lester always delivers. Among several gems, he explains why The Red Devils are more popular than some of their contemporaries.\n\nUnfortuntely, Wheeler not only interviewed Butler, but he wrote an adjacent review of King King. The Red Devils’ debut scored a 5 out of 10 from Wheeler. Read on:\n\nFirst Artists\n\nBy Steven P. Wheeler\n\nWhoever said blues is dead in L.A. has obviously never been to the tiny King King Club on the corner of La Brea and 6th Street on Monday Nights. For a band called The Red Devils has made this once- a-week gig a hot spot in the City of Angels since December 19, 1988.\n\nOver the past couple of years, the usually jaded L.A. music community has taken notice. The five-man band was named “Best Blues Artist” at the first annual L.A. Music Awards earlier this year, and the group’s Def American debut, King King, is currently bringing more converts to their unique slant on the blues.\n\nAccording to The Red Devils’ lead singer and brilliant harp player, Lester Butler, the group acknowledges its debt to legendary blues artists, but it’s also not afraid to explore new realms. “Our shit is contemporary, and that’s why we’ve never had a problem finding people who like us. A lot of the reason the blues doesn’t go over in L.A. is because you’ve got these guys playing the blues with a jazz or swing edge, which ends up sounding like something your mom or dad would listen to.”\n\nBecause their debut sizzles with some hard-core blues rock, it’s surprising to find out that none of the group’s members grew up in the swamps of Mississippi. “I think that if you’re from an urban background,” says Butler, “you’ll play the blues a little bit different than someone who is around nature more.”\n\nThe seeds of the band originated more than ten years ago when Butler was roaming the beaches of Southern California. “When I was a kid, I was a surfing, harp-playing hippie playing John Mayall tunes on the beach.” Soon after, Butler met the immortal blues guitarist Hollywood Fats, and the budding vocalist’s career began to change.\n\n“I really got into the blues when I met Hollywood Fats because he turned me on to all the hard-core Chess recordings, and that’s when I became hooked.” Butler adds that his early harp playing was tailor-made for his chosen musical direction.\n\nIt was in the late Eighties that Butler hooked up with future band mates Bill Bateman (drummer, best known for his work with The Blasters) and bassist Jonny Ray Bartel, who, along with his guitarist brother Dave Lee, had been fixtures in the L.A. rock scene after coming from Minnesota a few years earlier.\n\nThe Red Devils had somewhat of a revolving door policy for many years, as Butler explains. “We started out with a guy named Greg Hormel, Bill, Jonny and myself, and then we added Jonny’s brother, Dave Lee. Over the years, we’ve had numerous guitarists play through the band; guys like Dave Alvin and Junior Watson. It wasn’t until I found ‘The Kid’ in Texas that things became solidified.”\n\n“The Kid” is actually 20-year-old Paul Size, who was recommended by guitar great Junior Watson who was a substitute player for the Devils for many years and remains a loyal friend to the band.\n\nAs the band became more and more notorious among the recording industry, the band began to field offers, but it would take time before the right one came along. “We turned down deals from a couple of wimpy labels,” explains Butler. “You’ve got to understand that the guys in this band aren’t exactly ‘green’ guys. We’re not the type of musicians who will go out on the road and bust our ass for some little bullshit label that can’t help us. We make good money playing gigs at home, so it was like ‘Why go out and kill ourselves.'”\n\nTheir patience eventually paid off when Def American mogul Rick Rubin walked into the King King one Monday night in 1990. “Rick came into the joint, liked it and asked for a tape. We gave him one, and about a week later we went out to dinner, shook hands and Rick said, ‘Let’s make a record’.”\n\nAccording to Butler it was also Rubin’s idea to record the band’s debut album live at the King King, where the industry mover had first fallen in love with the group. “It sounded like a good idea to me, and there are some things that definitely came out well.” However, Butler says he would be remiss if he didn’t have some regrets about the recording process. “Sure there are. Every musician is a perfectionist but there’s a lot of stuff on the album that cancel out that perfectionism. I would have changed some of the harp tones, just minor things that most people wouldn’t even notice, but I notice it.”\n\nAs for the future, Butler insists that the band’s follow-up will be a proper studio album and will include more original material. “We’re writing new material for the next album right now. Of course, in another six months ora year when it comes time to make the next album things could have changed and we may have a whole new batch of material.”\n\nThe fact that the band seems prolific in the songwriting department makes one question the reason that there are so many covers on their debut effort. “They’re not so much covers as they are interpretations,” maintains Butler. “I mean ‘She’s Dangerous’ is my lyric with Willie Dixon’s ‘Hoochie Coochie Man,’ the difference is that we give these guys credit. It’s like it should be, instead of these guys who take credit for what black men did 40 years ago.”\n\nCurrently on tour with the Allman Brothers, The Red Devils are prepping up for their first trip overseas early next year. Europe has long been a favorite locale for blues musicians, and Butler gives his impression on why that is. “In America, you get people dissecting the blues so much that it’s not even a part of our culture anymore, especially this roots/rock/blues music. While over in Europe, they see these white guys playing the blues and it’s authentic to them. I’d say that’s the difference in the appreciation of the blues.”\n\nRed Devils\n\nLabel: Def American\n\nManager/Contact: Greg Lewerke, Vault Management\n\nAddress: 9157 Sunset Blvd., Suite 310, Los Angeles.
