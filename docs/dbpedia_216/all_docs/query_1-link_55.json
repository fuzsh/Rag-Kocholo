        "text": "The Black Crowes’ Debut Album ‘Shake Your Money Maker’ Turns 30 | Anniversary Retrospective (1990)\n\nFrom albumism.com\n\nChances are if you grew up in the 1970s with an older sibling (or an uncle ten years your senior, as in my case) with a small but quality-based record collection, that by 1990, you may not have even needed to hear Shake Your Money Maker. Having already been schooled in the meat-and-potatoes rock of Faces’ A Nod Is As Good As A Wink…To A Blind Horse (1971), Humble Pie’s Smokin’ (1972) or Performance: Rockin’ The Fillmore (1971), Free’s Fire and Water (1970) or the Rolling Stones quad-attack from Beggars Banquet (1968) through Exile on Main Street (1972), you may have felt that you’d heard it all before. (All of these albums, incidentally, were released in that magical five-year span of 1968 through 1972.)\n\nIf you hadn’t heard those records however, the debut album by The Black Crowes would probably have sounded like it came out of nowhere.\n\nWait. If you’re reading this, I would assume that you’re obviously a fan of Shake Your Money Maker, and that’s great. But if you haven’t heard all—or, shudder the thought, any—of the albums mentioned above yet, stop reading this right now and go find them. It’s 2020 and they’re all available for you to hear—I just checked. Those albums are all required listening to have any sort of context about the Black Crowes’ first album and its place in the rock & roll pantheon, or any of their subsequent albums actually, or rock & roll in general for that matter. Hell, even if you have heard them all, put them on again anyway, just because.\n\nOkay, where was I?\n\nBy 1987, to quote Frank Zappa, “rock [had] gotten entirely too preposterous.” The hair was big and the music was shallow. We didn’t call it “hair metal” back then, by the way. That’s a label that was affixed after the fact. It was just “pop-metal,” “bubblegum metal,” or, in some circles, “glam metal.” Either way, it just wasn’t the soul-blues-drenched-rock I was raised on. I had friends who were into it big time, though, so I tolerated what I could.\n\nWhat stood out, however, was Guns n’ Roses, who’d put out Appetite For Destruction that summer. It was unlike anything else at the time; it was more Aerosmith than that year’s Permanent Vacation…by Aerosmith. You could practically smell the danger and attitude coming off AFD‘s cover and inner-sleeve.\n\nThe times were changing. Immediately following the success of Appetite, groups that had spent the last few years glammed-up and decked out in makeup and pastels, suddenly looked gritty, grimy, and encased in denim and leather. Groups that fit that sleaze-rock template were being sought after and signed. In Atlanta, some other guys around my age were noticing the turning tide as well.\n\nAtlanta had spawned one of my all-time favorite bands, The Georgia Satellites, and they’d just recently hit it big with their self-titled debut, fueled by the number two classic, “Keep Your Hands to Yourself” (blocked from the top spot, tellingly at the time, by Bon Jovi’s pandering and overblown “Livin’ On A Prayer”). They were a bright spot in an otherwise dim landscape for a teenager searching for that elusive Stonesy-Faces swagger. Sadly, the Sats would only last for three albums and self-destruct by the end of the decade, but it’s as if a ratty new bunch led by a pair of temperamental brothers heard the call and picked up the torch.\n\nOriginally christened Mr. Crowe’s Garden, the band had made a name for itself touring up and back down the east coast and through the southeast in the late ’80s. Drummer and Kentuckian Steve Gorman joined Chris Robinson and his brother, guitarist Rich Robinson, after splitting from Mary My Hope (which also included future Crowes bassist Sven Pipien) to join a band he felt had more drive. (Ironically, Mary My Hope broke first regionally, but ultimately fizzled nationally, possibly sounding more like ’90s-era alternative rock than the world was ready for in 1989.)\n\nDrive they had in spades. Direction and discipline? Not so much. Enter A&R mastermind George Drakoulias, a former college buddy of Rick Rubin, who was about to help the now legendary producer launch his new rock imprint, Def American Records, and he wanted Mr. Crowe’s Garden on board. But first, he needed to whip them into shape.\n\nLike many college-aged kids in the south at the time, the Robinsons and Gorman were big fans of the left of the dial: R.E.M., The Replacements and their ilk with a dash of punk and folk. According to Gorman’s memoir Hard to Handle: The Life and Death of The Black Crowes (written with Steven Hyden), Drakoulias heard potential and he guided them to embrace their inner rock stars. He took them to the woodshed armed with Stones records to listen to with fresh ears, introduced Rich to the mighty open G tuning, ultimately convinced them to change their name to The Black Crowes, and the rest is rock & roll history.\n\nWhat sets Shake Your Money Maker apart from everything else on rock radio around its release in early 1990 is, quite frankly, its swagger. The open G tuning and rock-steady rhythm from Rich, the just-behind-the-beat groove from Gorman, the slinky low-end thump of Johnny Colt, and the Ron Wood-like crunchy attack of Jeff Cease. Soaring over it all was the once-in-a-generation wail of Chris Robinson.\n\nEqual parts Rod Stewart and Steve Marriott in the pipes with moves like Jagger with a bit of Axl Rose’s unpredictability, the older Robinson embodied everything a rock & roll frontman should be—including the massive ego. Another thing that set the Crowes apart from others in the pack was Chris Robinson’s lyrics. They went beyond the surface of the cliched emotions of the typical rock music of the time and dug deep to where you felt the pain in his words.\n\nYou know the songs: the ominous slow slide riff that glides us into an avalanche of pure rock and roll on “Twice As Hard.” The “Tumbling Dice” groove-and-weave of the mighty “Jealous Again.” The Humble Pie-meets-Faces at their melancholy best on “Sister Luck.” The sly attack of “Could I’ve Been So Blind.” The slow, southern soul grind straight from Memphis and Muscle Shoals of “Seeing Things.” The Otis Redding cover with the Aerosmith attack on “Hard To Handle.” The whiplash tempo of “Thick’N’Thin.” The Nick Drake-inspired jaw-dropping beauty of the now-classic “She Talks To Angels.” The appropriately-named “Struttin’ Blues” and the frenetic, anthemic, perfect-way-to-close-a-rock-and-roll-album “Stare It Cold.”\n\nThe engineer on those songs? Brendan “Bud” O’Brien, who had played bass for a spell in the Georgia Satellites and would later become a highly sought after producer due to his work on Money Maker, working with everyone from Pearl Jam and ex-Satellite Dan Baird to Neil Young and Bruce Springsteen.\n\nThe Black Crowes gave us one hell of a set of songs right out of the gate. The band would eventually grow musically by leaps and bounds throughout their career, moving from “The Rolling Clones” to a genuine melting pot of roots rock and true Americana, influenced by the Stones, Faces, Free, and Humble Pie, yes, but also The Band, Allman Brothers, Little Feat, and many others.\n\nShake Your Money Maker isn’t even their best album, nor was this the Crowes’ best lineup. Both were to come next with The Southern Harmony and Musical Companion (1992) with the addition of Marc Ford (who replaced Jeff Cease) and keyboardist Eddie Harsch (the keys on Money Maker were handled by another Georgia boy, the legendary Chuck Leavell).\n\nIn fact, I don’t think Money Maker is even in their top five when it’s all said and done. What it is, though, is the sound of a young, hungry, and passionate band that waved the flag of real rock & roll by making an album that kicked rock radio and MTV in their collective asses and exposed them to true authenticity…at least for a little while.\n\nThe Black Crowes Shake Your Money Maker (1990)\n\nFrom amazon.com\n\nBy 1990, the hard rock sound, which peaked in the early 70s, had long since worn out its welcome. It had progressed to the point of becoming a ludicrous parody of itself. Groups like Motley Crue, Poison and Def Leppard were the logical progression of the 70s hard rock sound. They took the look, sound and theatrics of the 70s rockers to ridiculous proportions.\n\nThis was thanks in part to Kiss, who proved that image could be more important than music. By the late 70s, rock groups were taking things a step further and exaggerating the look and style of Mick Jagger, Robert Plant and Steven Tyler.\n\nBy the early/mid 80s, the hard rock look and sound pioneered by the aforementioned names had reached the point of absurdity. Hair metal was all the rage and MTV had ushered in a video era where the look was now just as important as the music, if not more so. With this new image, the quality of the music suffered immensely. This new generation of rockers was so enraptured with the rock and roll lifestyle that they completely forgot about musicianship and artistry. This music is now affectionately known as Cheese Metal or Hair Metal. Music that seems laughable nowadays, with snicker-inducing hair and fashion to match. Music that could, in no way, be taken seriously by any true lover of music.\n\nThe trend wore on and throughout the late 80s, many now-forgotten hair metal groups came and went. Then, in 1990, a group came out of Georgia with a completely different ideology. This group, The Black Crowes, was making music that was completely out of style in this world of hair spray and spandex. Their debut, Shake Your Money Maker, was full of tight, fiery spurts of boogie-rock, the likes of which had not been heard on a major record since the mid-70s. Songs like “Twice As Hard” and “Jealous Again” stood out like a sore thumb amidst the dreary sea of synthesized, phony hard rock of 1990. This was rock that went back to the basics. This was rock that was genuine. Rock that forsook image and style and concentrated on the music and the interplay between musicians.\n\nShake Your Money Maker was a godsend for rock fans who were tired of rockers who leaped about on the stage in tight pink pants while flames erupted from the stage floor. This is real rock and roll. This is not an image. This is music. The Black Crowes took the influence of the best of the early 70s scene. Lead singer Chris Robinson encapsulated the 70s rock lead singer. Summoning a bit of Rod Stewart (The Faces), Steve Marriot (Humble Pie), Steven Tyler (Aerosmith), Paul Rodgers (Free/Bad Company) and Robert Plant (Led Zeppelin) with each song, Robinson took the lead-singer image and idea back to its roots.\n\nThe guitar work of Rich Robinson and Jeff Cease was concise and bluesy, recalling the Mick Taylor-era Rolling Stones. The stinging slide guitar on “Twice As Hard”, must have been a revelation since nearly every bit of blues influence had been drained since the hair-metal revolution. Songs such as “Could I’ve Been So Blind”, “Seeing Things” and “Thick N’ Thin” resuscitated the deceased blues-rock form with vibrance that was sorely lacking from even the best of the mainstream rock acts.\n\nShake Your Money Maker proved that good, old-fashioned rock and roll had not died. The Black Crowes brought it back to life. Los Angeles’ Guns N’ Roses was the only other group to come close to retro blues-rock with their “Appetite For Destruction”, but they were too nihilistic and nasty to truly channel the spirit of classic early 70s rock. Shake Your Money Maker and its follow-up “The Southern Harmony and Musical Companion” was overshadowed by Nirvana’s “Nevermind”, which took rock and roll in a new, unexplored direction. However, The Black Crowes were really the only group to give classic rock lovers their fix of hard riffs, tasty solos and bluesy, wailing vocals.\n\nShake Your Money Maker is an important album, and an oasis in the desert of the 1990 rock scene. This is probably the only 1990 album that sounds as if it could have been recorded in 1973. In 30 years, Shake Your Money Maker will still sound great, whereas most of 1990’s other musical offerings will be long forgotten, and more than likely, unlistenable."
