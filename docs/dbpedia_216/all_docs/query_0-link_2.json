        "text": "The Black Crowes have rarely strayed from form since their 1990 debut, Shake Your Money Maker, introduced them as one of rock's best revivalist bands of the last decade of the century.\n\nAnd while band turnaround and turmoil often came close to derailing their story, they've persevered to make some of the best-unfettered rock 'n' roll music of the era, as you will see in the below list of The Black Crowes Albums Ranked Worst to Best\n\nBrothers Chris (vocals) and Rich (guitar) Robinson's often public spats have threatened to pivot the spotlight from what matters most. But their tumultuous relationship has also fueled their best records, from that explosive debut to their 2024 reunion album Happiness Bastards.\n\nREAD MORE: The Black Crowes, 'Happiness Bastards' Album Review\n\nWhether drawing inspiration from (and comparisons to) '70s giants like the Rolling Stones and Faces (as well as the Allman Brothers Band and Led Zeppelin) or making a later turn toward more stage-bound exploratory pieces, the Black Crowes have lined up a set of records that often stand with the best of their reference points. (Their second album, 1992's The Southern Harmony and Musical Companion, sounds like a great lost Stones album from the mid-'70s.)"
