        "text": "If we look back at 1992 through the lens of that yearâs most popular hit songs and albums, several major commercial developments stick out across a host of genres. Of course, thereâs no way to form a complete picture of a time by digging only as deep as the top of the charts, but the mainstream stratosphere is where the story of The Black Crowesâ second album The Southern Harmony and Musical Companion begins.\n\nWith the runaway success of their multi-platinum 1990 debut Shake Your Money Maker, The Black Crowesâ bluesy, Southern-tinged brand of rock and roll was initially viewed â not without reason â as a knockoff of the quintessential 70s sound canonized by British blues-rock groups like The Rolling Stones and The Faces. Interestingly enough, however, the Atlanta outfit was marketed within the context of the reigning hard-rock paradigm of the day. Which meant that the Crowes existed (and built their following) largely within the hair-band sphere.\n\nAs longtime/former drummer Steve Gorman wrote in his tell-all memoir Hard to Handle: The Life and Death of the Black Crowes, âwe were in magazines next to [bands like] Cinderella and Winger.â That all changed when The Southern Harmony and Musical Companion arrived in record stores on May 12th, 1992.\n\nWith a cover photo that bore a resemblance to the artwork of 1969âs eponymous sophomore effort by The Band, as well as a title that consciously referenced the deep well of American roots music, Southern Harmony announced a dramatic shift in both sound and identity for The Black Crowes.\n\nFrom the slinky opening strains of lead single âRemedyâ - one of four songs from the album to hit number one on Billboardâs album-rock chart - the growth was strikingly clear. They now possessed the musical acumen to wear the past on their sleeve as if they had earned the creative licence to make something new and entirely their own out of what their forebears had done.\n\nIn short, Southern Harmony showed that The Black Crowes were no longer guilty of style over substance. They also had help. For starters, itâs impossible to overstate the chops, sophistication and musical sensitivity of keyboardist Ed Harsch and lead guitarist Marc Ford, both of whom joined in time to record the album, rounding-out what would come to be known as the bandâs classic lineup.\n\nAs the perfect vehicles for the quantum leap taken by the groupâs songwriting nucleus of rhythm guitarist Rich Robinson and frontman Chris Robinson, Harsch and Ford both possessed a touch that made every style the band tried seem natural, like it had belonged to them â and to us as listeners â all along.\n\nLooking back, itâs something of a small miracle that the album struck a chord with the same youth generation that was rocking to the likes of Faith No More, Soundgarden and the Red Hot Chili Peppers. Songs like âThorn in my Prideâ, âHotel Illnessâ and âBad Luck Blue Eyes Goodbyeâ all percolate with shades of a sepia-toned past, evoking dusty country roads as the band channels acoustic folk, electric blues, gospel, country twang, Southern rock and classic rock with an overarching ambience inspired by soul recordings made at the legendary Alabama recording studio Muscle Shoals.\n\nTo say the least, the new lineup gelled. The basic tracks, in fact, were cut more or less live by the whole band, with some passing muster in just one or two takes. As the late Harsch told VH-1 in the Crowesâ edition of Behind the Music, âthe spontaneity was obviously there; it was totally like making a blues record.â\n\nWith all that said, though, the music on Southern Harmony couldnât have fallen into place the way it does without the addition of background vocalists Taj Artis and Barbara Mitchell, who steal the show with a buoyancy, soulfulness and power thatâs downright hair-raising.\n\nItâs because of Artis and Mitchell, for example, that the bandâs rendition of Bob Marleyâs âTime Will Tellâ comes across so convincingly, a reggae tune transformed into something like a hymnal from a Southern church service. Indeed, âTime Will Tellâ captures The Black Crowes shedding the affectations of âHard to Handleâ, and Southern Harmony is the album where all the pieces came together for them.\n\nOddly enough, the album found success â debuting at number one and going double-platinum in the U.S. â amidst a commercial climate it was somewhat out-of-step with.\n\nRock bands parlaying roots influences into mass appeal was nothing new, and there was a well-established template for rockers (Tom Petty, etc) who flirted with country stylings and vice-versa (John Cougar Mellencamp, etc). But whatâs fascinating about Southern Harmony is that it can be viewed in retrospect as a precursor of the cross-pollination that was soon to come between the worlds of country and rock.\n\nIn mid-1992, the tidal currents in music lifted the boats of the surging alt-rock movement to the same level as juggernauts like Guns Nâ Roses, Metallica, U2 and R.E.M. This seismic shift, incidentally, was driven in no small part by Southern Harmony engineer Brendan OâBrien, whoâd recorded Shake Your Money Maker before going on to produce Pearl Jamâs Ten and Temple Of The Dog, among others.\n\nMeanwhile, mainstream country acts like Garth Brooks, Wynonna Judd and Billy Ray Cyrus became massive, while alt-countryâs insurgent rise was underway. The truth is that Southern Harmony didnât have much to do with any of those camps. But when we look back from todayâs vantage point, is it so hard to imagine âThorn in my Prideâ catching on with country fans?\n\nSouthern Harmony didn't exactly make rock radio safe for country music, but it does tantalize us with possibilities of what might have happened had popular culture been in the same genre-fluid headspace as the band was at the time â a headspace more fans (and musicians) inhabit today, arguably, than in 1992. That the latest incarnation of the Crowes just played the 2022 Stagecoach festival would suggest as much.\n\nIn Hard to Handle, Steve Gorman recalls the bandâs appearance at MTVâs 1992 VMA awards, the same one that infamously featured a feuding Guns Nâ Roses and Nirvana. Gorman declined to go to the afterparty, leaving early to fly back to his wife so they could start a vacation. âHad I known how the rest of the decade was gonna shake out,â he writes, âI mightâve stayed around for a bit. We never got that close to the center of it all again.â\n\nMaybe so, but they didnât have to. Though Southern Harmony was followed by The Black Crowesâ slow descent from mainstream visibility, it marked the beginning of a vibrant creative streak that still resounds beautifully this many years later. Above all, perhaps, what you hear on the record is the sound of a band finding itself even as it wanders off the trail.\n\n9/10\n\nSouthern Harmony was released in 1992 via Def American.
