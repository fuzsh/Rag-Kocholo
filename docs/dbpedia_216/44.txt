The Black Crowes Biography

The Black Crowes is an American rock band from Marietta, Georgia, that was formed in 1984. They have eight studio albums, four live albums, and several charting songs to their credit. Chris Robinson, Rich Robinson, and Sven Pipien make up the band.

The band’s initial iteration, “Mr. Crowe’s Garden,” was named after Leonard Leslie Brookes’ children’s book Johnny Crow’s Garden. They later evolved into a revivalist band dedicated to 1970s-era blues rock, influenced by present local acts like R.E.M., as well as 1960s psychedelic pop and classic southern rock. Despite the fact that the band has had a high turnover rate throughout its history, Chris and Rich Robinson, who established the band while attending Walton High School, have always been the driving force behind it. In 1987, the Robinson brothers recorded their first professional demo for A&M Records.

Producer George Drakoulias recruited the band to Def American Recordings in 1989, and they released their debut album, Shake Your Money Maker, the following year. The Southern Harmony and Musical Companion, their follow-up, hit the top of the Billboard 200 in 1992. After discarding the unreleased album Tall the previous year, the band released Amorica in 1994. After selling over 500,000 copies, the album was certified Gold. Three Snakes and One Charm (1996), By Your Side (1999), and Lions (2001) followed, all of which were somewhat successful but fell short of the band’s previous two albums’ chart success.

The band spent the rest of 2001 on the “Listen Massive” headline tour in support of Lions, which took them across Europe and Japan before wrapping off with 36 gigs in the United States. With the resignation of drummer Steve Gorman and an announcement that the band was “taking a vacation,” the band effectively disbanded in January 2002.

In August 2002, a live CD was published that was compiled from two 2001 events at Boston’s Orpheum Theater. At the 2004 Jammy Awards, certain members of the band reunited to perform “Sometimes Salvation” with Gov’t Mule. Chris Robinson released two albums during the hiatus: New Earth Mud in 2002 and This Magnificent Distance in 2004. Meanwhile, Rich Robinson founded Hookah Brown, a short-lived band, before releasing his first solo album, Paper, in 2004. The Robinson brothers and Eddie Harsch reformed the band in early 2005, and they performed for several years before releasing Warpaint in 2008, which charted at number five on the Billboard chart.

In August 2010, the band began a 20th anniversary tour, which was followed by a second sabbatical, following the release of their greatest hits/acoustic double album Croweology. Following a tour in 2013, the band announced another dissolution in 2015, before reuniting in late 2019 to plan a 2020 tour in support of Shake Your Money Maker’s 30th anniversary. Except for Chris and Rich Robinson, the only two permanent members of the band throughout its history, the band had lost all of its original line-up by this point.

The Black Crowes have sold over 30 million records and are ranked 92nd on VH1’s list of the 100 Greatest Hard Rock Artists. Melody Maker dubbed them “The Most Rock ‘n’ Roll Rock ‘n’ Roll Band in the World,” while Rolling Stone readers named them “Best New American Band” in 1990.
