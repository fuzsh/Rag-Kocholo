        "text": "26 Writings on Partition and Film Adaptations\n\nMr. Abu Saleh\n\nMali and his group rob Ram Lal and kill him. The police suspect the Jugga as one of the culprit and the other Iqbal. Rest of the movie follows the text.\n\nDiscussion:\n\nNevertheless, there are various striking difference between the novel and movie. The novel opens with the peaceful life of the village Mano Majra. The village comes to life with the arrival and departure of trains. The only sound we hear that informs the villagers about the beginning, middle and end of the day is of trains.\n\nBefore daybreak, the mail train rushes through on its way to Lahore… blows two long blasts of the whistle. In an instant, all Mano Majra comes awake… By the time the 10:30 morning passenger train from Delhi comes in, life in Mano Majra has settled down to its dull daily routine… As the midday express goes by, Mano Majra stops to rest…When the evening passenger from Lahore comes in, everyone gets to work again…When the goods train steams in, they say to each other,” There is the goods train”. It is like saying goodnight.\n\nThe novel first published as Mano Majra in 1956 by Groves Publisher later it was published by Chatto & Windus as Train to Pakistan. The decision to publish it initially as Mano Majra suggests that the novel centres on the village life. The second title of the novel Train to Pakistan vocalizes the partition. Nevertheless, in both the cases protagonist of the novel remains the village Mano Majra that bears the insanity of partition.\n\nMoreover, the division of the novel into four sections that is (i) Dacoity (ii) Kalyuga (iii) Mano Majra and (iv) Karma also suggests the same. The first section ‘Dacoity’ is at the centre in the first section. In the second section the partition and mass killings is Kalyuga, age of vice. The third section shows the reactions and implication of partition on Mano Majra, villagers like how the peaceful life is disturbed and chaos is spreading and people are plotting to kill each other in the name of religion. In the fourth section every one, irrespective of their religious affinities, is left to their Karma or what was decided that cannot be changes and partition becomes the karma.\n\nThus, in this manner it is the village, Mano Majra, is the protagonist of the novel. Khushwant Singh gradually develops the narrative in order to show that at the time of crisis how minds function and people react to situation. Nevertheless, humanity still persists through the people like Nooran and Jaggu, in other words through love.\n\nThus, one can see that ice-candy-man uses partition as an excuse to show his sexual jealousy. Suddenly first Hassan is killed and then coming of ice-candy-man to take away Shanta reveals that how the partition became horrible excuse to fulfill sexual desires. Further, in the film focus shifts from the child Lenny to the Nanny and to horrific incidents of mass killings, abduction and rape that took place at the time of partition. Unlike the novel where Lenny goes with her God mother to find the Nanny and rescues her from the ice-candy-man.\n\nHowever, there are novels whose adaptation to films becomes difficult then the director has to make a choice. According to Sergei Eisenstein films most readily adapt novels with externalities and physical description. But if any fiction has internal monologue or, stream of consciousness, then adaptation becomes difficult. Eisentstein marks Dickens’s ‘cinematic techniques’, of narration including anticipation of such phenomena as frame composition and the close-up.\n\nFilm Adaptation:\n\n“My task which I am trying to achieve is, by the powers of the written word, to make you hear, to make you feel-it is, before all, to make to see’ Joseph Conrad, Nigger of the Narcissus ‘between the percept of the visual image and the concept of the mental image lies the root difference between the two media”3. Thus, it is the image that both the writer and director create but the difference lies in the creative mode. One does it through words and the other through visual. The word image is open for a reader to interpret whereas the visual images come in a concrete form. However, it does not mean that words do not create images.\n\nFiction and the Camera Eye: “Concretised form”, i.e. where a great deal of visual material is available in the narrative. “the integrity of the seen object and . . . gives it palpable presence apart from the presence of the observer” eg, in James Joyce or Flaubert. ‘a balanced distribution of emphasis in the rendering of what is looked at, who is looking, and what the looker makes of what she sees’, eg Henry James (Alan Speigel, Fiction and the Camera Eye)\n\nNevertheless, an often overlooked aspect of film adaptation is the inclusion of sound and music. In a literary text, a specific sound effect can often be implied or specified by an event, but in the process of adaptation, the film-makers will have to determine specific sound characteristics which subliminally affect narrative interpretation. In some cases of adaptation, music may have been specified in the original material. Three modes of involvement: (i) the telling mode (e.g. literature), (ii) the showing mode (e.g. film or theatre) and (iii) the interactive mode (e.g. videogames or theme park rides). While the first two modes immerse the audience in the activity of reading, watching and listening by appealing mostly to their imagination, the interactive mode of engagement allows them to participate physically in the adapted texts, to enter the story and act as one of the characters (Linda Hutcheon, op. cit., pp. XIV-XV, 22-27) The impoverishment of the book’s content due to necessary omissions in the plot and the inability of the filmmakers to read out and represent the deeper meanings of the text. The perception problems related to the visuality of the filmic medium. Each act of visualization narrowed down the open-ended characters, objects or landscapes, created by the book and reconstructed in the reader ́s imagination, to concrete and definite images. The verbally transmitted characteristics of the heroes, places and the spatial relations between them, open to various decoding possibilities in the process of imagining, were in the grip of flattening pictures. Visualization was therefore regarded as destroying many of the subtleties with which the printed word could shape the internal world of a literary work only in the interaction with the reader’s response4. In a certain way all works of art offer multilayered modes of communication that break through the virtually established barriers between the different media. Each work lays the groundwork for many possible adaptations because each art can play with elements of other arts5. Limitations of the ‘Fidelity Approach” and “less judgmental” discourse of intertextuality: stress on how film makers move within the field of intertextual connections and employ means of expression available in film arts to convey meanings. Adaptation is an original interpretation. The combination of known with unknown is the mixture of repetition with difference, familiarity and with novelty (Linda Hutcheon, Art of Adaptation). Unity of artistic communication across media: we begin to notice that many of its elements gain a new life when interpreted in the context of the new medium’s specificity. Oscillation between the different media is of great importance to our perception of the world, for it locates works of art in the energetic field between different modes of communication and beyond the limits of a particular medium6.\n\n(VII) Fiction to Film: Adaptation;\n\nThe script of the movie Train to Pakistan was written by Khushwant Singh along with director of the movie. On the other hand the movie Earth-1947 (Cracking India) was rewritten by Deepa Mehta. Both the movies are the example of adaptation wherein the questions of loyalty, fidelity and so on to the sources text are generally raised.\n\nNevertheless, one needs to understand that there are different ways of creating a story or plot in a film. Sometime the idea can be original of the director or s/he borrows and adapts from some existing literatures. John Harrington, in his book Film And/As Literature estimated that a third of all films ever made have been adapted from novels, and, if you included other literary forms, such as dramas or short stories, that estimate might well be 65 percent or more. Almost all of the works of classic literature studied in high school have been adapted into film. For example see the following list of Hindi biopics alone Sardar(1993), Bandit Queen (1994, Zubeida (2001), Bhagat Singh(2002), Mangal Pandey (2005), Guru (2007), Jodha Akbar (2008), Rang Rasiya (2008),3 Idiots (2009), Paan Singh Tomar (2010), The Dirty Picture (2011), Shahid (2012), Bhaag Milkha Bhaag,(2013), Mary Kom (2014), Aligarh (2015), Manjhi: The Mountain Man (2015), MS Dhoni: The Untold Story (2016), Neerja (2016), Azhar (2016), Sarabjit (2016),Dangal (2017)\n\nSo, adaptation has always been central to filmmaking. This is a relationship that we live with but while someone adapts from an existing form the comparison arises. Film adaptation is generally subjected to intense scrutiny. Film adaptations from literary texts receive fatal criticism in moralistic way as cinema has done a great disservice to literature. According to Welsh, “The most basic and banal focus in evaluating adaptations is the issue of “fidelity,” usually leading to the notion that “the book was better”.\n\nAdaptations are like re-telling. So, the semiotic adaptation and the visual presentation of the same text should be looked at from different perspectives. Sometimes adaptation is like replication and it stands in its own as an independent work close or far from the ‘source’. It creates a new story and thus, claims cultural validity. Moreover adaptation can be seen as hybrid construction mingling with different media and discourses and collaborations.\n\nStructuralist and post-Structuralist theoretical discussion have subverted the idea of hierarchy between literature and films. They have significantly changed the theory and concept of adaptation in a positive way.\n\n“Derridean deconstruction, for example, undid overly rigid binarism in favor of notions of “mutual invagination”. Deconstruction also dismantled the hierarchy of “Original” and “copy”. In a Derridean perspective, the auratic prestige of the original does not run counter to the copy; rather, the prestige of the original is created by the copies, without which the very idea of originality has no meaning. The film as “copy” by analogy, is not necessarily inferior to the novel as “original”. The Derridean critique of origins is literally true in relation to adaptation. The “original” always turns out to be partially “copied” from something earlier….” (Robert Stam et al, Literature and Film…, 08)\n\nCritiques of Adaptation:\n\nFollowing are some of the major significant points that make significantly portray the difference when a literary text is adapted into a film. They are:\n\nThe impoverishment of the book’s content due to necessary omissions in the plot and the inability of the filmmakers to read out and represent the deeper meanings of the text.\n\nThe perception problems related to the visuality of the filmic medium. Each act of visualization narrowed down the open-ended characters, objects or landscapes, created by the book and reconstructed in the reader ́s imagination, to concrete and definite images.\n\nThe verbally transmitted characteristics of the heroes, places and the spatial relations between them, open to various decoding possibilities in the process of imagining, were in the grip of flattening pictures. Visualization was therefore regarded as destroying many of the subtleties with which the printed word could shape the internal world of a literary work only in the interaction with the reader’s response.\n\nInter-Arts:\n\nIn a certain way all works of art offer multilayered modes of communication that break through the virtually established barriers between the different media. Each work lays the groundwork for many possible adaptations because each art can play with elements of other arts8. This makes it difficult to adapt a literary writings into films. It does not create hierarchy but significantly places the argument and difficulty or incapability of transforming an artistic work from one medium into other.\n\nInter-Arts:\n\nIn a certain way all works of art offer multilayered modes of communication that break through the virtually established barriers between the different media.

Everything that we read and see has some elements of some other creative work. Hence every new artistic creation that comes out is an addition but not ‘the original’. To this Julia Kristeva calls intertextuality, the term she introduced in her work “Word, Dialogue and Novel”. According to her a text is a dynamic site not a static product as the literary words, she says “an intersection of textual surface rather than a point (a fixed meaning), as a dialogue among several writings”. She further says, “each word (text) is an inter section of other words (texts) where at least one other word (text) can be read” Thus, words contain other words. As they are not self-contained and they are always in dialogue with time and history. In other words texts are always created with pre-existing meanings. Thus meaning is both outside and inside of a text. In other words meaning is with the readers and outside, that is, within the time or society of one’s own milieu. As Kristeva says “any text is constructed as a mosaic of quotations; any text is the absorption and transformation of another” hence, every partition narrative that is written and told is drawn from that particular historical period. Film adaptation is not about rewriting a story nor does it remain at the stage of intertextuality. It is an intermedial space wherein a literary piece, in this case, gets into a visual form. Here two different medium communicate with each other.\n\nAll the partition narratives share a text of pain and mass killings. Further any writer or director when makes a movie she/he does not make any thing ‘original’. They recreate the words (texts) that already exist. They rather add to the existing corpus of literary works, both literary and cinematic. In other words on the text called the partition of India various narratives are told and retold time again in many modes, literary and visual being examples.\n\n(VIII) Summary :\n\nIn this module you are introduced to the subject of partition literary writings, films made on the partition narrative and to the theory and concept of adaptation, intertextuality and Intermediality. In this we have discussed the literary writings on partition, then the films made on partition in general, and then the films adaptation of literary writings. At the end we have analysed the two texts, Train to Pakistan and Cracking India, and their cinematic adaptations.
