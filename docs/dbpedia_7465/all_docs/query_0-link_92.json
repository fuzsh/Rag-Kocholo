        "text": "Commissioner Ann Howard, Precinct Three\n\nCommissioner Ann is said to be everywhere, meeting constituents to address difficult situations and celebrate community accomplishments. Ann often speaks on the need for smarter development, taking into consideration access to water, impact on roads and safety. Her first term as Commissioner includes Covid, the Opioid Overdose crisis, and both extreme hot and cold weather disasters.\n\nBut the quick four years includes successes, too. Ann has helped increase public investment in land management and development services, wildfire prevention, mental health treatment, supportive housing, and roads. Ann dedicated many hours to the successful 2023 bond initiative, which raised $509 million to improve roads, add sidewalks and expand land acquisition for parks and water conservation. Already, the County has purchased nearly 2,000 acres for parkland.\n\nWhen the Federal Government approved local COVID recovery funds, Ann led the charge to invest $110 million to build supportive housing for people experiencing homelessness, to expand the Ronald McDonald House for families and to improve Emergency Management across the community.\n\nAnn is running unopposed in 2024 for election to her second term.\n\nAnn is a graduate of UT Law and LBJ Schools and a former attorney on the US Senate Judiciary Committee. She and her husband are life-time members of the Texas Exes, members of St. Martin’s Lutheran Church and now, grandparents to Addison, Jack and Clementine.\n\nTXDoT Presentation. 9/25/23 RM 1431 Community Meeting\n\nCAMPO Presentation. 9/25/23 RM 1431 Community Meeting\n\nProposed 2023 Bond Projects Including Cost of Issuance\n\nTravis County ARPA LFRF Allocation (PDF)\n\nPublic Comments for the I-35 Capital Express Central Project\n\nApproved by Commissioners Court , 2/28/23 Voting Session\n\nCommissioner Howard Opinion Piece in the Austin American Statesman/Proposed Travis County Development is not our Violet Crown\n\nWATCH #TravisCounty Commissioner Ann Howard and the Fire Marshal’s Office explain how YOU can use the Home Ignition Zone Assessment NOW to protect your home from potential wildfires."
