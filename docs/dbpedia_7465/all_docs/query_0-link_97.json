Those using a Scene Plus card during the purchase process must pay a reduced fee of $1.\n\n“The fact that consumers, after deciding to purchase a movie ticket through the website or app and assuming they become aware that Cineplex has dripped the online booking fee, can then choose to avoid the online booking fee, does not change the fact that Cineplex has made a price representation to the public that is unattainable on the website or in the app due to the fixed obligatory online booking fee,” Boswell said.\n\nHe added that Cineplex’s purchase process is designed to encourage customers to proceed with buying a ticket despite the fee and pointed out that the theatre chain has used signs at cinemas telling customers the box office is closed but tickets can be bought online or in Cineplex’s app.\n\nAdvertisement 4\n\nStory continues below\n\nThis advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below.\n\nArticle content\n\nCineplex did not respond to a request for comment on Boswell’s latest filing.\n\nRecommended from Editorial\n\nMovie ticket price-dripping case should be dismissed: Cineplex\n\nCompetition Bureau suing Cineplex over pricing for online tickets\n\nCineplex’s Anne Fitzgerald named general counsel of the year\n\nThe chain’s fee that has sparked the battle with Boswell was implemented on June 15, 2022 and intended as an online booking fee for certain advance ticket purchases.\n\nIt was launched as Cineplex was recovering from forced closures during the COVID-19 pandemic and a cancelled deal that would have seen the company sold to U.K. theatre brand Cineworld for more than $2 billion.\n\nArticle content\n\nShare this article in your social network"
