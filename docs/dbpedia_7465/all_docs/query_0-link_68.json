        "text": "PROFESSIONAL CREW\n\nAustin has been production hub since the 1970s with a local, experienced crew base and talent. Austin crews have the technical expertise to always bring productions in on-time, on-budget and as the director envisioned. From Production Assistants to Producers, find the local crew you need in the Austin Film Commission Production Directory. We also welcome you to list if you are a local media production professional or vendor. Check out the \"Made In Austin\" filmography and see the full list of amazing work that's been produced here.\n\nDIVERSE LOCATIONS\n\nAustin is home to many unique terrains—from lakes to farmland to hill country—all within 45 minutes of downtown. When Austin isn't playing itself, our modern downtown has doubled for New York City and Chicago. Nothing is too far apart, so company moves are cost effective: film in one of Austin's mid-century neighborhoods and then one of the Americana small towns that surround Austin all in one day. Looking for a specific location or want to know Austin location aesthetics for your next production, then please check out the Austin Film Commission Location Database. If you have a local property and welcome filming on-site, we welcome you to list in the database. For those curious about where some of Austin's most iconic productions were filmed and want to plan a visit, don't miss the Film Tourism Guide.\n\nPERMITTING\n\nThe City of Austin offers free film permitting for both Austin's Parks and Right Of Way (streets and sidewalks). There may be some incurred costs like parking, production insurance and any necessary use of police officers for closures. Film permits are waived completely for private properties outside of stunt and practical SFX work. Jurisdictions around Austin see plenty of filming too, this is not their first rodeo and the permitting processes are in place for a film friendly experience.\n\nINCENTIVES\n\nThe Texas Moving Image Industry Incentive Program (TMIIIP), administered by the Texas Film Commission is cash grant based on in-state spending by feature film, television and commercial projects that offers up to 22.5% back to qualifying productions. Those projects filming in Austin that qualify for TMIIIP can also apply for the City of Austin’s Economic Development Department's Austin Creative Content Incentive Program, which offers up to 0.75% back to qualifying local film and television projects. Additionally, all productions made in Texas can use a Comptroller issued tax exemption on goods rented or purchased for direct use in the production of film, television and commercial projects.\n\nFACILITIES\n\nAustin is home to a number of studio facilities, providing both small commercial spaces and large-scale soundstages. Most facilities are conveniently located and ready to house your next shoot. Each complex offers a range of stage sizes, cyc walls, office spaces, support services and other amenities to meet your shooting needs. There are also a number of Post-Production facilities in Austin—so you can sound mix, color grade, add motion graphics and picture lock your production without leaving the city limits.\n\nVENDORS\n\nAustin-based rental houses can supply your production with the latest industry standard equipment. No need to pay expensive shipping fees when our local camera, grip and lighting vendors have everything you need in stock. Austin is also home to dolly, crane, trailer, honeywagon, picture car suppliers and more! Find the local vendors for your production needs in the Austin Film Commission Production Directory.\n\nLODGING, TRAVEL & CULTURE\n\nAustin offers cast and crew a great home away from home with premiere hotel accommodations. Austin has great culture with famous cuisine, live music, and a friendly, relaxed atmosphere - plus over 30 unique film festivals yearly and media production resources! Austin-Bergstrom International Airport makes travel easy with direct flights to and from London, Los Angeles, New York, Hawaii, Toronto, Mexico City and more.\n\nWEATHER\n\nNeed to film a commercial with a green backdrop in January? No problem! Austin generally sees over 300 Days of sunshine each year, which means productions will rarely lose a day of filming due to weather."
