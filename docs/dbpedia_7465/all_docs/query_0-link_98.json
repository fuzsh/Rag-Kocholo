        "text": "Tista' taqra bil- Malti.\n\nIn a recent episode of “What’s on Newsbook” on RTK103, Matthew Maggi, a Maltese assistant film director, voiced his concerns about the state of Malta’s film industry.\n\nMaggi emphasised the urgent need for prominent artists to speak out against injustices within the sector and reiterated that the position of Malta’s Film Commissioner, Johann Grech, has become untenable.\n\nMaggi urged established actors who have participated in critically acclaimed Maltese films such as “Luzzu” and “Simshar” to address the chronic underfunding of local productions.\n\nHe criticised the Malta Film Commission as partisan, suggesting it has become a hostage to Grech’s personal ambitions and nepotism. This sentiment echoes the views of former film commissioners, including Peter Busuttil and Oliver Mallia, who stressed that the role should not be used for self-aggrandisement.\n\nThe assistant director did not mince words, stating, “Unfortunately, his party [PL] continues to defend him. If these events occurred outside Malta, he would have been dismissed immediately.” This criticism comes amidst a broader controversy surrounding Grech’s tenure, which began in 2015 and has been marred by accusations of profligate spending and mismanagement.\n\nRecent revelations have fueled public outrage. A 10-minute film featuring Grech himself, titled “Once Upon a Time in Malta,” reportedly cost over €500,000 and employed 130 crew members under a foreign director. This extravagance stands in stark contrast to the government’s failure to establish a promised €2 million National Film Fund to support local artists.\n\nThe Mediterrane Film Festival, now in its second year, has also been a source of contention. British comedian David Walliams was brought back to Malta for the third time, with documents revealing he was paid €120,000 for hosting the 2022 Malta Film Awards. Maggi pointed out that the €500,000 spent on Grech’s short film could have funded a feature-length production instead.\n\nThese expenditures are part of a larger pattern of questionable financial decisions. The National Audit Office’s 2021 report criticised Grech for wasteful spending, leaving the Malta Film Commission with a negative working capital exceeding €1 million by 2020. His annual salary package, recently disclosed, surpasses €150,000 and includes various allowances and perks.\n\nMaggi also highlighted the demise of the Valletta Film Festival, which once showcased international films while providing a platform for local talent. He lamented that it was allowed to “die” due to lack of support, only to be replaced by a festival that primarily celebrates foreign productions.\n\nThe controversy has extended beyond financial matters. Actress Lara Azzopardi recently alleged that Grech had engaged in bullying behaviour towards her and other women during her time working for the Malta Film Commission. She described a toxic work environment where wages were withheld without explanation and local talent was consistently undervalued.\n\nAs the debate intensifies, calls for Grech’s resignation are growing louder. Tourism Minister Clayton Bartolo has reportedly spoken to Grech about some of his recent actions, deeming them “unacceptable.” However, critics argue that more decisive action is necessary to address the systemic issues plaguing Malta’s film industry.\n\nThe situation underscores a broader debate about the role of government in supporting and promoting national culture. As Maggi aptly put it, “A film festival is a cultural aspect of a country and should not be organised by the film commission but run by neutral entities.” The recent decision to transfer the film fund to Arts Council Malta has been welcomed as a step in the right direction."
