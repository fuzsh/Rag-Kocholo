        "text": "Eurimages is the cultural support fund of the Council of Europe. Established in 1989, it currently numbers 38 of the 46 member states of the Strasbourg-based Organisation, plus Canada as associate member.\n\nEurimages promotes the European audiovisual industry by providing financial support to feature films, animations and documentaries produced as co-productions. In doing so, it encourages co-operation between professionals established in different countries.\n\nEurimages has a total annual budget of approximately â‚¬27.5 million. This financial envelope derives essentially from the contributions of the member states as well as returns on the loans granted by the Fund.\n\nThere are three calls for projects per year. The Secretariat applies the eligibility criteria contained in the regulations and reports to the Executive Committee. Projects declared eligible by the Secretariat are then assessed by Co-production Working Groups comprised of independent external experts, selected via a call for expressions of interest. In making recommendations on the support to be granted, the Co-production Working Groups apply the selection criteria decided upon by the Board of Management and the Executive Committee.\n\nEurimages support takes the form of soft loans or subsidies (co-production support) or subsidies (promotion of co-production and exhibition). Soft loans are repaid on the basis of revenues generated by the projects supported.\n\nEurimages has four support schemes:\n\nfilm co-production,\n\nexhibition\n\npromotion and\n\ngender equality"
