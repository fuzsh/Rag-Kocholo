        "text": "Under section 10 of the Film Censorship Ordinance (Cap. 392) (FCO), a censor has to take into consideration the following matters when making a decision:\n\nwhether the film portrays, depicts or treats cruelty, torture, violence, crime, horror, disability, sexuality or indecent or offensive language or behaviour;\n\nwhether the film denigrates or insults any particular class of the public by reference to the colour, race, religious beliefs or ethnic or national origins or the sex of the members of that class; and\n\nwhether the exhibition of the film would be contrary to the interests of national security.\n\nThe censor shall also take into account the following matters when making a decision:\n\nthe effect of the film as a whole and its likely effect on the persons likely to view the film;\n\nthe artistic, educational, literary or scientific merit of the film and its importance or value for cultural or social reasons; and\n\nin relation to the intended exhibition of the film, the circumstances of such exhibition.\n\nThe Film Censorship Guidelines for Censors (Guidelines) are published under section 30 of the FCO to provide guidance to censors in exercising their functions under the FCO. The Guidelines specify that censors should aim to reflect contemporary public attitudes towards censorship standards. Censors will also make reference to the results of public opinion surveys on film censorship standards carried out from time to time and the advice given by the panel of advisers on film censorship on a film.\n\nThe depiction of nudity is an established art form, but full-length frontal nudity in a film that can be watched by children is generally not tolerated by local audiences. Such depiction is not normally permitted in a Category I film. Depictions of nudity in Category IIA films should be carried out with tact and discretion, and nudity depicted in a sexually suggestive manner should not be permitted. In considering whether to pass films depicting nudity for Category IIB or III, the censor will consider the degree of the possible erotic effect of that nudity.\n\nTo apply for a certificate for exhibition of a film, the applicant should submit the following materials to the Office for Film, Newspaper and Article Administration:\n\nthe film (acceptable film format includes VCD, DVD, Blu-ray Disc, DCP and USB flash drive etc.);\n\na completed Film Submission Form (which can be downloaded here); and\n\nrelevant information about exhibition of the film (including venue and date of exhibition)\n\ntwo working days before the scheduled examination date. After reviewing the film, if the Film Censorship Authority considers it suitable for public exhibition, a Certificate of Approval (in the case that the film requires a classification) or a Certificate of Exemption (in the case that the film is exempted from classification) will be issued for its exhibition.\n\nUnder section 9 of the Film Censorship Ordinance (Cap. 392), the Film Censorship Authority may exempt a film from classification if it is of a class or description of film prescribed as suitable to be exempted. According to Schedule 2 of the Film Censorship Regulations (Cap. 392A), the classes or descriptions of films which are suitable to be exempted from classification are:\n\nCultural films\n\nEducational films\n\nInstructional films\n\nPromotional films\n\nSports films\n\nTravelogues\n\nMusical films\n\nReligious films\n\nA Certificate of Exemption will be issued for the public exhibition of films exempted from classification.\n\nAny member of the public aged 18 or above and proficient in Chinese and English may apply to be a member of the Panel of Advisers. Application forms may be obtained from the Office for Film, Newspaper and Article Administration or downloaded here).\n\nFor more information, please refer to the information leaflet on how to become a Film Censorship Adviser."
