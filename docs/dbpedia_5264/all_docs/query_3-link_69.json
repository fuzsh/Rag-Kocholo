        "text": "· First quarter sales of $1.5 billion. Total sales declined 10 percent consisting of a 4 percent decline in core sales and negative FX translation of 6 percent.\n\n· EPS declined 8 percent to $0.65 and adjusted operating margins declined 60 basis points to 11.6 percent compared to first quarter 2014 adjusted results.\n\n· Free cash flow usage of $159 million in the quarter and the company expects to deliver full year free cash flow greater than 120 percent of net income.\n\n· The company updates 2015 adjusted EPS guidance to approximately $3.80 from a range of $4.10 - $4.25.\n\nReconciliations of GAAP to Non-GAAP measures are in the attached financial tables.\n\nMANCHESTER, United Kingdom - April 21, 2015- Pentair plc (PNR) today announced first quarter 2015 sales of $1.5 billion. Sales were down 10 percent compared to sales for the same period last year. First quarter 2015 earnings per diluted share from continuing operations (\"EPS\") were $0.65, down 8 percent from adjusted EPS of $0.71 in the first quarter of last year. Adjusted EPS, adjusted operating income, and segment income exclude redomicile-related expenses and restructuring costs.\n\n\"We started the year much slower than we had originally anticipated as a decline in oil prices and the strengthening dollar have led many of our customers to delay business in what feels like a global capital spending pause,\" said Randall J. Hogan, Pentair Chairman and Chief Executive Officer. \"We believe that Pentair is in the right markets for the long term and we have detailed plans in place to work through the anticipated near term challenges.\"\n\nFirst quarter 2015 operating income was $171 million, down 15 percent compared to adjusted operating income for first quarter 2014, and adjusted operating margins were 11.6 percent, a decline of 60 basis points when compared to adjusted first quarter 2014 operating margins.\n\nFree cash flow in the quarter was a usage of $159 million, reflecting normal seasonality and timing of cash flows. The company expects to deliver full year free cash flow greater than 120 percent of net income.\n\nPentair paid dividends of $0.32 per share in the first quarter of 2015. Pentair previously announced on December 10, 2014 that its Board of Directors approved a 16 percent increase in the company`s regular annual cash dividend rate for 2015 to $1.28 from $1.10. 2015 marks the 39th consecutive year that Pentair has increased its dividend.\n\nFIRST QUARTER BUSINESS HIGHLIGHTS\n\nAll references to changes in core sales exclude the impact of currency translation.

Although the economic headwinds have worsened, we are focusing on the elements within our control. This includes getting more aggressive on cost actions, continuing to invest in differentiated growth, and select M&A where appropriate.\"\n\nIn addition, the company introduced second quarter 2015 adjusted EPS guidance of $0.95 - $0.96, down approximately 6 percent on an adjusted basis versus the same quarter last year`s adjusted EPS. The company expects second quarter revenue to be approximately $1.64 billion, which would be down approximately 10 to 11 percent on a reported basis and down 3 to 4 percent on a core basis compared to second quarter 2014 revenue.\n\nEARNINGS CONFERENCE CALL\n\nPentair Chairman and CEO Randall J.
