        "text": "Article updated on August 1st, 2024 by Bob Ciura\n\nSpreadsheet data updated daily\n\nThe Dividend Aristocrats are a select group of 68 S&P 500 stocks with 25+ years of consecutive dividend increases.\n\nThey are the ‘best of the best’ dividend growth stocks. The Dividend Aristocrats have a long history of outperforming the market.\n\nThe requirements to be a Dividend Aristocrat are:\n\nBe in the S&P 500\n\nHave 25+ consecutive years of dividend increases\n\nMeet certain minimum size & liquidity requirements\n\nThere are currently 68 Dividend Aristocrats. You can download an Excel spreadsheet of all 68 (with metrics that matter such as dividend yields and price-to-earnings ratios) by clicking the link below:\n\nDisclaimer: Sure Dividend is not affiliated with S&P Global in any way. S&P Global owns and maintains The Dividend Aristocrats Index. The information in this article and downloadable spreadsheet is based on Sure Dividend’s own review, summary, and analysis of the S&P 500 Dividend Aristocrats ETF (NOBL) and other sources, and is meant to help individual investors better understand this ETF and the index upon which it is based. None of the information in this article or spreadsheet is official data from S&P Global. Consult S&P Global for official information.\n\nNote 1: On January 24th, 2024, Fastenal (FAST) was added to the list while Walgreens Boots Alliance (WBA) was removed, leaving 68 Dividend Aristocrats.\n\nSource: S&P News Releases.\n\nYou can see detailed analysis on all 68 further below in this article, in our Dividend Aristocrats In Focus Series. Analysis includes valuation, growth, and competitive advantage(s).\n\nTable of Contents\n\nHow To Use The Dividend Aristocrats List To Find Dividend Investment Ideas\n\nPerformance of the Dividend Aristocrats\n\nSector Overview\n\nThe 10 Best Dividend Aristocrats Now\n\nDividend Aristocrats Analysis (The Dividend Aristocrats In Focus Series)\n\nHistorical Dividend Aristocrats List (1989 – 2024)\n\nFrequently Asked Questions\n\nFinal Thoughts\n\nHow to Use The Dividend Aristocrats List To Find Dividend Investment Ideas\n\nThe downloadable Dividend Aristocrats Excel Spreadsheet List above contains the following for each stock in the index:\n\nPrice-to-earnings ratio\n\nDividend yield\n\nMarket capitalization\n\nAll Dividend Aristocrats are high-quality businesses based on their long dividend histories. A company cannot pay rising dividends for 25+ years without having a strong and durable competitive advantage.\n\nBut not all Dividend Aristocrats make equally good investments today. That’s where the spreadsheet in this article comes into play. You can use the Dividend Aristocrats spreadsheet to quickly find quality dividend investment ideas.\n\nThe list of all 68 Dividend Aristocrats is valuable because it gives you a concise list of all S&P 500 stocks with 25+ consecutive years of dividend increases (that also meet certain minimum size and liquidity requirements).\n\nThese are businesses that have both the desire and ability to pay shareholders rising dividends year-after-year. This is a rare combination.\n\nTogether, these two criteria are powerful – but they are not enough. Value must be considered as well.\n\nThe spreadsheet above allows you to sort by trailing price-to-earnings ratio so you can quickly find undervalued, high-quality dividend stocks.\n\nHere’s how to use the Dividend Aristocrats list to quickly find high-quality dividend growth stocks potentially trading at a discount:\n\nDownload the list\n\nSort by ‘Trailing PE Ratio,’ smallest to largest\n\nResearch the top stocks further\n\nHere’s how to do this quickly in the spreadsheet:\n\nStep 1: Download the list, and open it.\n\nStep 2: Apply a filter function to each column in the spreadsheet.\n\nStep 3: Click on the small gray down arrow next to ‘Trailing P/E Ratio’, and then sort smallest to largest.\n\nStep 4: Review the highest ranked Dividend Aristocrats before investing. You can see detailed analysis on every Dividend Aristocrat found below in this article.\n\nThat’s it; you can follow the same procedure to sort by any other metric in the spreadsheet.\n\nPerformance Of The Dividend Aristocrats\n\nIn July 2024, the Dividend Aristocrats, as measured by the Dividend Aristocrats ETF (NOBL), registered a positive return of 5.1%. It under-performed the SPDR S&P 500 ETF (SPY) for the month.\n\nNOBL generated returns of 5.1% in July 2024\n\nSPY generated returns of 1.2% in July 2024\n\nShort-term performance is mostly noise. Performance should be measured over a minimum of 3 years, and preferably longer periods of time.\n\nThe Dividend Aristocrats Index has slightly under-performed the broader market index over the last decade, with a 10.76% total annual return for the Dividend Aristocrats and a 13.06% total annual return for the S&P 500 Index.\n\nBut the Dividend Aristocrats have exhibited lower risk than the benchmark, as measured by standard deviation.\n\nSource: S&P Fact Sheet\n\nHigher total returns with lower volatility is the ‘holy grail’ of investing. It is worth exploring the characteristics of the Dividend Aristocrats in detail to determine why they have performed so well.\n\nNote that a good portion of the outperformance relative to the S&P 500 comes during recessions (2000 – 2002, 2008). Dividend Aristocrats have historically seen smaller drawdowns during recessions versus the S&P 500. This makes holding through recessions that much easier. Case-in-point: In 2008 the Dividend Aristocrats Index declined 22%. That same year, the S&P 500 declined 38%.\n\nGreat businesses with strong competitive advantages tend to be able to generate stronger cash flows during recessions. This allows them to gain market share while weaker businesses fight to stay alive.\n\nThe Dividend Aristocrats Index has beaten the market over the last 28 years…\n\nWe believe dividend paying stocks outperform non-dividend paying stocks for three reasons:\n\nA company that pays dividends is likely to be generating earnings or cash flows so that it can pay dividends to shareholders. This excludes ‘pre-earnings’ start-ups and failing businesses. In short, it excludes the riskiest stocks.\n\nA business that pays consistent dividends must be more selective with the growth projects it takes on because a portion of its cash flows are being paid out as dividends. Scrutinizing over capital allocation decisions likely adds to shareholder value.\n\nStocks that pay dividends are willing to reward shareholders with cash payments. This is a sign that management is shareholder friendly.\n\nIn our view, Dividend Aristocrats have historically outperformed the market and other dividend paying stocks because they are, on average, higher-quality businesses.\n\nA high-quality business should outperform a mediocre business over a long period of time, all other things being equal.\n\nFor a business to increase its dividends for 25+ consecutive years, it must have or at least had in the very recent past a strong competitive advantage.\n\nSector Overview\n\nA sector breakdown of the Dividend Aristocrats Index is shown below:\n\nThe top 2 sectors by weight in the Dividend Aristocrats are Industrials and Consumer Staples. The Dividend Aristocrats Index is tilted toward Consumer Staples and Industrials relative to the S&P 500.\n\nThese 2 sectors make up over 40% of the Dividend Aristocrats Index, but less than 20% of the S&P 500.\n\nThe Dividend Aristocrats Index is also significantly underweight the Information Technology sector, with a ~3% allocation compared with over 20% allocation within the S&P 500.\n\nThe Dividend Aristocrat Index is filled with stable ‘old economy’ blue chip consumer products businesses and manufacturers; the 3M’s (MMM), Coca-Cola’s (KO), and Johnson & Johnson’s (JNJ) of the investing world.\n\nThese ‘boring’ businesses aren’t likely to generate 20%+ earnings-per-share growth, but they also are very unlikely to see large earnings drawdowns as well.\n\nThe 10 Best Dividend Aristocrats Now\n\nThis research report examines the 10 best Dividend Aristocrats from our Sure Analysis Research Database with the highest 5-year forward expected total returns.\n\nDividend Aristocrat #10: Clorox Co.

Is there an ETF that tracks the Dividend Aristocrats?\n\nAnswer: Yes, the Dividend Aristocrats ETF (NOBL) is an exchange-traded fund that specifically holds the Dividend Aristocrats.\n\n4.

It is comprised of 53 stocks with 50+ years of consecutive dividend increases.\n\nThe Blue Chip Stocks List: stocks that qualify as Dividend Achievers, Dividend Aristocrats, and/or Dividend Kings\n\nThe High Dividend Stocks List: stocks that appeal to investors interested in the highest yields of 5% or more.\n\nThe Monthly Dividend Stocks List: stocks that pay dividends every month, for 12 dividend payments per year.\n\nThere is nothing magical about the Dividend Aristocrats. They are ‘just’ a collection of high-quality shareholder friendly stocks that have strong competitive advantages.\n\nPurchasing these types of stocks at fair or better prices and holding for the long-run will likely result in favorable long-term performance."
