Piotroski is relatively unknown accounting professor who shuns publicity and rarely gives interviews.\n\nHe graduated from the University of Illinois with a B.S. in accounting in 1989, received an M.B.A. from Indiana University in 1994. Five years later, in 1999, after earning a Ph.D. in accounting from the University of Michigan, he became an associate professor of accounting at the University of Chicago.\n\nIn 2000, he wrote a research paper called \"Value Investing: The Use of Historical Financial Statement Information to Separate Winners from Losers\" (pdf).\n\nHe wanted to see if he can develop a system (using a simple nine-point scoring system) that can increase the returns of a strategy of investing in low price to book (referred to in the paper as high book to market) value companies.\n\nWhat he found was something that exceeded his most optimistic expectations.\n\nBuying only those companies that scored highest (8 or 9) on his nine-point scale, or F-Score as he called it, over the 20 year period from 1976 to 1996 led to an average out-performance over the market of 13.4%.\n\nEven more impressive were the results of a strategy of investing in the highest F-Score companies (8 or 9) and shorting companies with the lowest F-Score (0 or 1).\n\nOver the same period from 1976 to 1996 (20 years) this strategy led to an average yearly return of 23%, substantially outperforming the average S&P 500 index return of 15.83% over the same period.\n\nPentair Piotroski F-Score Related Terms\n\nThank you for viewing the detailed overview of Pentair's Piotroski F-Score provided by GuruFocus.com.
