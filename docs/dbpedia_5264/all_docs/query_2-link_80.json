Agriculture is still a major part of the economy even though only a small percentage of the population, less than 1%, are employed in the farming industry.[12]\n\nIn The Blufflands, cheese, wine, honey, milk, apples, and maple syrup are produced.\n\nMinnesota is the U.S.'s largest producer of sugar beets, sweet corn, and green peas for processing and farm-raised turkeys.[13] State agribusiness has changed from production to processing and the manufacturing of value-added food products by companies such as General Mills, Cargill, Hormel Foods Corporation (prepackaged and processed meat products), and the McDonald Food Company.\n\nForestry, another early industry, remains strong with logging, pulpwood processing, forest products manufacturing, and paper production. The amount of forested land in the state is declining, from 16.7 million acres (68,000 km2) in 1990 to 16,200,000 acres (66,000 km2) in 2004; however, the average forest is maturing. From 1999 to 2004 the average annual growth within the state was 550 million board-feet (1,300,000 m3) of timber, while the average amount harvested was only 330 million board-feet (780,000 m3) per year.[14]\n\nMinnesota was famous for its soft-ore iron mines which produced a significant portion of the world's iron ore for over a century. Although the pure ore is now depleted, taconite mining remains strong using processes developed locally to save the industry. In 2004 the state produced 75 percent of the usable iron ore in the country.[13] 3M (formerly Minnesota Mining and Manufacturing Co.) today is a diversified manufacturer of industrial and consumer products. The port of Duluth was created by the mining boom and today continues to be an important shipping port for the Midwest's agricultural and ore products.\n\nManufacturing was not left out, either. The brass era automobile maker Dan Patch was founded in Minneapolis in 1911.[15]\n\nRetail is represented by Target Corporation, Best Buy, and Supervalu, all headquartered in the Twin Cities. Southdale Center, the first fully enclosed and completely climate-controlled shopping mall in the United States opened on October 8, 1956, in the suburban city of Edina. The largest shopping mall in the United States, the Mall of America, is located in Bloomington.\n\nSt. Jude Medical represents a growing biomedical industry spawned by university research, and Rochester is the headquarters of the world-famous Mayo Clinic. UnitedHealth Group is the second largest health insurance company in the U.S.\n\nFinancial institutions include U.S. Bancorp, Ameriprise and Thrivent Financial for Lutherans.\n\nAs might be expected in state with a love of the outdoors, boats and other recreational products are manufactured by a number of Minnesota companies, including Polaris Industries and Arctic Cat, who make snowmobiles and ATVs, Alumacraft Boat Company, and Lund Boats.\n\nToday, the most salient characteristic of the economy is its diversity; the relative outputs of its business sectors closely match the United States as a whole.[16]\n\nThe digital state\n\n[edit]\n\nMinnesota attracted entrepreneurs and engineers, especially in the computer industry, and became a leading center of computer manufacturing after the war.[17] Engineering Research Associates was formed in 1946 to develop computers for the Navy and the intelligence agencies. It merged with Remington Rand, and soon became a division of Sperry Rand.[18] William Norris, Seymour Cray, and others left Sperry in 1957 to form Control Data Corporation (CDC).[19] Cray Research was formed when Cray left CDC to form his own company. \"Minnesota was the undisputed epicenter of top-secret digital computing for decades.\"[20] Medical device maker Medtronic also was founded in the Twin Cities in 1949. Honeywell was a national force in computing until selling its computer division to Groupe Bull in 1989, remaining a prominent military and aerospace concern headquartered in Minnesota until 1999 when, after a merger, it moved to New Jersey. National firms, such as International Business Machines, moved manufacturing and R&D operations to Minnesota. State government and powerful politicians such as Hubert Humphrey maintained a favorable climate. The Minnesota Educational Computing Consortium brought state-wide networked computing in the 1970s and developed educational software such as the popular \"Oregon Trail\" game. The Federal Reserve Bank of Minneapolis combined computing power with financial clout across its region from Montana to upper Michigan. The University of Minnesota trained many computer specialists who decided to stay in the Minnesota rather than move to California. Minnesota thus preceded the better-known industrial districts of Route 128 around Boston and Silicon Valley.[21] An active high-technology sector is represented today by Alliant Techsystems, Ceridian, Cray, Digi International, Digital River, Geek Squad, Hutchinson Technology, Imation, IBM Rochester, Lawson Software, MacSoft, Medtronic, MTS Systems, St. Jude Medical, Stratasys, SPS Commerce, 3M, and more than 400 smaller software companies.\n\nMinnesota's largest companies\n\n[edit]\n\nNonprofits\n\n[edit]\n\nThe following table lists the Minnesota-based non-profit organizations among the largest 400 in the U.S. by 2006 private donations.[22]\n\nState rank\n\nby revenue Name National\n\nrank Donations ($millions)\n\n2006 estimate Headquarters city 1 Mayo Clinic 45 265.9 Rochester 2 University of Minnesota 46 265.4 Minneapolis 3 Scholarship America 114 136.2 St. Peter 4 Minnesota Public Radio 378 40.3 St. Paul 5 Hope for the City 379 40.3 Edina\n\nPrivate companies\n\n[edit]\n\nThe following table lists the privately held companies headquartered in Minnesota with 2007 revenues over $1 billion.[23]\n\nState rank\n\nby revenue Name National\n\nrank Revenue\n\n($billions) 2007 estimate Employees Headquarters city Known for 1 Cargill 1 107.90 131,000 Minnetonka Farm Products 2 Carlson 87 38.00 170,000 Minnetonka Travel and Lodging 3 Schwan Food Company 124 3.30 17,000 Marshall Dairy Products and Frozen Foods 4 Andersen Corporation 136 3.00 10,600 Bayport Windows and Building Materials 5 Rosen's Diversified 184 2.40 4,200 Fairmont Meat Products 6 M A Mortenson 218 2.14 2,700 Robbinsdale Heavy Construction 7 Fagen 227 2.08 3,600 Granite Falls Heavy Construction 8 Holiday Cos. 238 2.00 4,600 Bloomington Retailing 9 Taylor Corp. 286 1.70 12,500 North Mankato Publishing – Periodicals 10 Ceridian 295 1.65 9,500 Bloomington Information Technology Services 11 Buffets, Inc. 334 1.46 38,000 Eagan Restaurants 12 API Group 351 1.35 6,000 New Brighton Conglomerates 13 Lifetouch 424 1.05 20,000 Eden Prairie Photography 14 Ryan Companies 427 1.04 600 Minneapolis Heavy Construction\n\nPublic companies\n\n[edit]\n\nThe following table lists the public companies headquartered in Minnesota with 2010 revenues placing them in the 1000 largest U.S. companies.[9]\n\nState Rank\n\nby Revenue Company Name National\n\nRank Revenue ($millions)\n\n2010 estimate Headquarters City Known for 1 UnitedHealth Group 6 184,840 Minnetonka Managed Health Care 2 Target 33 67,390 Minneapolis Retailing 3 Best Buy 47 49,694 Richfield Retailing 4 Supervalu 61 40,597 Eden Prairie Food Distribution and Retailing 5 3M 97 26,692 Maplewood Diversified Manufacturing 6 CHS, Inc. 103 25,268 Inver Grove Heights Fuel Distribution 7 US Bancorp 126 20,518 Headquarters in Minneapolis, domiciled in Delaware Banking and Finance 8 General Mills 166 14,796 Golden Valley Food Processing 9 Land O' Lakes 218 11,146 Arden Hills Dairy Products 10 Xcel Energy 237 10,311 Minneapolis Electricity Production and Distribution 11 Ameriprise 246 10,046 Minneapolis Financial Planning 12 C.H.

As of 2001, Minnesotans were using a total of 7.2 million US gallons (27,000 m3) of gasoline per day, and fuel use rises in the region by about 2% annually. About 70% of the gasoline fuel used in the state comes from Pine Bend and the nearby St. Paul Park Refinery, while most of the rest comes from a combination of the Mandan Refinery in North Dakota, and the Superior Refinery in Superior, Wisconsin. 40 to 50% of Pine Bend's output is used within the state. Flint Hills is currently planning a $100 million expansion to increase capacity at the plant to about 330,000 barrels per day (52,000 m3/d). Petroleum from the north comes to the state through one of the longest pipelines in the world, the Lakehead Pipeline and the Minnesota Pipeline. Additional crude comes from the south via the Wood River Pipeline.\n\nEthanol fuel is produced in the state, and consumer gasoline is required to contain 10% ethanol (E10). As of 2006, Minnesota is the only U.S. state with such a mandate. 20% ethanol (E20) will be mandated in 2013.[24] Minnesota has the highest number of fuel stations offering E85 fuel, with 300 statewide.[25] A 2% biodiesel blend has also been required in diesel fuel since 2005. Electricity-producing wind turbines have become popular, particularly in the windy southwest region on the Buffalo Ridge. As of November 2006, the state is the country's fourth-largest producer of wind power, with 812 megawatts installed and another 82 megawatts planned.[26]\n\nLike other Midwestern states that experience cold winters, Minnesota is heavily dependent on natural gas for home heating. Just over two-thirds of homes use the fuel.\n\nState taxes\n\n[edit]\n\nMinnesota's income tax is progressive with four rates, 5.35%, 7.05%, 7.85%, and 9.85%.[27] The sales tax in Minnesota for most items is 6.875% effective July 1, 2009.[28] The state does not charge sales tax on clothing, some services, or food items for home consumption.[29] The state legislature may allow municipalities to institute local sales taxes and special local taxes, such as the 0.5% supplemental sales tax in Minneapolis.[30] The cities of St. Paul, Rochester, Duluth and St. Cloud have similar taxes. Excise taxes are levied on alcohol, tobacco, and motor fuel. The state imposes a use tax on items purchased elsewhere but used within Minnesota. Owners of real property in Minnesota pay property tax to their county, municipality, school district, and special taxing districts. The overall state and local tax burden is calculated to average 11.9% in 2006, ranking 4th highest in the country.[31]\n\nReferences\n\n[edit]\n\nBusiness"
