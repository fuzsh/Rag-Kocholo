        "text": "Hi all,\n\nI am renting a house with an inground swimming pool.\n\nThe landlord inherited the pool from the previous owner of the house.\n\nThe pool has a Pentair light, and I can see the junction box next to the light, ~10 inches above the ground. The light has never been on, and I suspect the bulb needs to be replaced.\n\nAs silly as it might sounds, I could not find the light switch or the GFCI breaker anywhere in the house, or next to the pool.\n\nThe landlord doesn't know where the switch is either.\n\nIs there any way I can locate the switch?\n\nI tried using a mobile app called \"wire locator\" to track the wires from the junction box, but that didn't work.\n\nThanks!\n\nThe pool has a Pentair light, and I can see the junction box next to the light, ~10 inches above the ground. The light has never been on, and I suspect the bulb needs to be replaced.\n\nUse a multimeter and a cable trace toner to try and follow the wires connecting to the junction box.\n\nUse the multimeter to confirm no voltage is on the wires when you open the junction box. Then connect the toner to a wire. Try and follow the wire with the toner. You may need a good powerful one to follow wires underground and into walls.\n\n@Newdude is probably familiar with them.\n\nElectricians know how to trace wires.\n\nOk I’m back. 10 mins past Yabba Dabba Do time, and yes I Yabba Dabba Did.\n\nSo two common ways to do this back in the day. A normal circuit breaker to the pool equipment with a GFCI powering the switch, or off in the yard closer to the pool.\n\nThis was out by my pool controlling street lamp thingies, but same principle. GFCI below protecting the switch and light. This was BURIED in plants when we moved in and I walked right past it for 3 months.\n\nThe other way would be to have a GFCI breaker installed in the main electric panel. The top one seen here is a GFCI breaker for the old pool but the lights just have a regular breaker because the GFCI was out in the yard.\n\nIf you had a GFCI breaker it may go to a random switch inside the house, probably near the patio doors.\n\nThe tricky part is how much do you want to throw at this ? If you locate the feed to the light, we can start to get answers but not being used for so long, there could be several problems. For starters you probably need a new light. The GFCI and switch could be long broke also. And there’s no telling how many times the landscapes found the dead wire while planting new greenery each spring.\n\nBut see if you can find the outside switch, then look at the breaker box to see if there are any GFCI breakers (hopefully labeled like mine). From there we can hatch a plan.\n\nThank you all. Here are some pictures:\n\n1) Light with junction box\n\n2) Equipment in the garden. Please note that this is beyond the pool, very far from the house. I would not expect the switch to be here\n\n3) This is a closer view of the timer (which was recently replaced) and a mysterious switch. I think the switch was originally meant to control the socket next to it\n\n4) The circuit breaker for the house. There is no specific circuit breaker for the pool. Unfortunately, most of the CBs are unlabeled\n\n6) Finally, the junction box. I measured with a tester and there is no tension on the wires (I assume the green is the ground).\n\nHow would you further troubleshoot the problem?\n\nI could not find any switches.\n\nThanks!\n\nHow would you further troubleshoot the problem?\n\nI could not find any switches\n\nThen let’s go with the switch you did find. The distance isn’t a big issue. Wire was cheap back in the day and trenches were open to the equipment from the house and then on to the pool.\n\nIf you are comfortable working with electric *and only if*…….\n\nFlip the switch and go test the junction box for voltage with a voltage detector. If the voltage detector screams, you probably only need a new light.\n\nIf locating is more involved than that, you’ll probably need an electrician to trace and kill the power to the circuit so it can be further isolated and fixed.\n\nI can’t really advise further because if you knew how to work on live electric, you wouldn’t need us. Safety first.\n\nHey Fabio, good morning. I had a 3AM thought when the best ones happen !! Lol\n\nGo over to RevCo. (Google will take you there). It’s an electrical supply store tucked away where you probably wouldn’t find it on your own. They know every electrician in the land on a first name basis. They also know which ones take small jobs and many handyman types that would probably be more friendly on your wallet. There is no need to pay master electrician rates for simple diagnosing.\n\nExplain your story about being on a shoestring budget at somebody else’s house and they will probably give you some solid options, be it who to call, or which cheaper meter/tracer you need.\n\nGo over to RevCo.

I'll contact them tomorrow morning.\n\nThis is gold\n\nI'll contact them tomorrow morning\n\nIf at all possible, go in person. It helps greatly to have a kind person in front of them then on the phone. They should have stools. Go have a seat and put your elbows on the counter like you belong there. Let them have a pow wow amongst the employees about how to help the nice guy waiting patiently, so greatful for their help.\n\nthey might send you home with some tools. They might tell you who to call too. But take the Uber if you have to."
