        "text": "Given the size of its organization, the scope of the project, and the number of distinct user groups involved, Impekable advised Pentair to first invest in the creation of a new design system that would form the building blocks of its future apps.\n\nThe extensive design system created by Impekable encompassed:\n\nAn overall UI style guide\n\nA library of design components that could be drawn on quickly to create new apps and experiences\n\nDesign guidance on where and how to deploy these components\n\nAn icon library\n\nAdditional content and accessibility guidelines\n\nThe design system was developed from scratch, starting with the smallest conceptual elements (known as atoms) like the Pentair color blue and shades of gray. These atoms formed the basis for more complex components (known as molecules and organisms) like buttons and card components.\n\nThe design system followed the Atomic Design methodology, which organizes components into atoms, molecules, organisms, templates, and pages. This structured approach ensured a cohesive and scalable design system.\n\nThe component library’s theme defined the entire design language: including colors, spacing, font weights, and sizing across different platforms. This theme served as the foundation for all components, ensuring consistency and reusability.\n\nUltimately, these and other elements enabled our team to create visual consistency between Pentair’s different apps and experiences, in addition to speeding up subsequent design processes."
