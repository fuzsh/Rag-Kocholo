        "text": "Pentair Water announced to its employees Tuesday it will consolidate operations with plants in Wisconsin and Mexico, causing a potential loss of more than 70 jobs.\n\nThe manufacturing plant, at 1215 S. Adams St. in Grand Island, employs 87 people and produces water pumps for the agriculture industry.\n\nThe consolidation will happen in phases, plant officials said, and is expected to be complete by the end of September 2008.\n\nPentair decided to consolidate because the Grand Island plant was one of the company's smaller facilities, said Mary Jo Surges, vice president and general manager of the water systems business.\n\n\"It's really in order to remain competitive in our marketplace,\" she said.\n\nThe company will still maintain a presence in Grand Island to serve its local customers. Fewer than 10 people are expected to remain employed in customer service and the build center, which caters to special orders, Surges said.\n\nWhile the company will do its best to provide other jobs for employees, the majority are expected to take severance pay, said Steve Duea, vice president of human resources for Pentair's pump division.\n\nMary Slattery, a part-time data entry employee at Pentair in Grand Island, said the news of the consolidation was unexpected.\n\n\"Everybody was shocked,\" she said.\n\nListen now and subscribe: Apple Podcasts | Google Podcasts | Spotify | RSS Feed | SoundStack | All Of Our Podcasts\n\n\"There are a lot of guys out in that plant that have been out there 20, 30 years, and they're not quite retirement age. I guess I feel bad for them. It's not going to be easy for them to find a job.\"\n\nPlant managers will meet with employees on an individual basis during the next few days to discuss their future with the company, Slattery said.\n\nThe plant, which covers 9,600 square feet and is housed on 11 acres, was built in the 1960s. Before it was purchased by Pentair Water two or three years ago, it was owned by Sta-Rite, said Cindy Johnson, president of the Grand Island Area Chamber of Commerce.\n\nCity leaders first became concerned about the potential of the plant's consolidation when Sta-Rite was purchased, Johnson said.\n\n\"Unfortunately, this time around it's a change that's going to negatively impact Grand Island,\" Johnson said.\n\nJohnson met with plant managers on Tuesday to discuss the consolidation and said the community couldn't have done anything more to keep the jobs here.\n\n\"I was assured this afternoon that there wasn't anything different that the community could've done or anyone could've done differently,\" Johnson said. \"This is a good producing company, good employees. It's simply one of those business decisions we don't like but makes sense for the company.\"\n\nPlant officials said they hoped the advanced notice would give employees time to find other jobs.\n\nSurges said the company is proud of its Grand Island workers and will do whatever it can to assist them during the transition.\n\n\"It was certainly a surprise for our employees,\" she said, \"and we feel really bad for the impact this decision has on our Grand Island employees.\"\n\nBe the first to know\n\nGet local news delivered to your inbox!\n\n* I understand and agree that registration on or use of this site constitutes agreement to its user agreement and privacy policy."
