This dividend reflects a 5 percent increase in the Company’s regular cash dividend rate and marks the 48th consecutive year that Pentair has increased its dividend.\n\nOUTLOOK\n\nMr. Stauch concluded, “As we look to 2024, we are committed to driving growth, profitability and returns by focusing on our mission to help the world sustainably move, improve, and enjoy water, life’s most essential resource. We are investing in key areas to drive long-term growth and optimizing our sourcing and operational footprint which we expect to continue to drive further margin expansion in 2024 as these Transformation initiatives scale.”\n\nThe Company is introducing 2024 GAAP EPS guidance of approximately $3.82 to $3.92 and on an adjusted basis of approximately $4.15 to $4.25, which includes a $0.07 negative impact, primarily driven by changes in global tax standards. This is an increase of 11 percent to 13 percent compared to 2023. The Company anticipates full year 2024 sales to increase 2 percent to 3 percent on a reported basis.\n\nIn addition, the Company introduces first quarter 2024 GAAP EPS of approximately $0.81 to $0.84 and on an adjusted EPS basis of approximately $0.88 to $0.91. The Company expects first quarter sales to be down approximately 2 percent to 3 percent on a reported basis compared to first quarter 2023.\n\nEARNINGS CONFERENCE CALL\n\nPentair President and Chief Executive Officer John L.
