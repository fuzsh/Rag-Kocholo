        "text": "MINNEAPOLIS —- Pentair Inc. is merging with a division of Tyco International Ltd. in an all-stock deal as the Swiss manufacturer breaks itself into three parts.\n\nThe deal, expected to close at the end of September, values the Tyco flow control unit at about $4.9 billion and includes the assumption of $275 million of Tyco debt and $94 million of minority interest. Tyco shareholders will own 52.5 percent of the new, combined Pentair company, and Pentair shareholders will own 47.5 percent.\n\nThe combination of the two similar-sized companies creates a $7.7 billion industrial company with 30,000 employees.\n\nPentair, which produces water storage, filtration, pumping and treatment systems, employs about 15,000 people. Tyco Electronics is now called TEConnectivity and is headquartered in Switzerland, with U.S. offices in Berwyn, Pa."
