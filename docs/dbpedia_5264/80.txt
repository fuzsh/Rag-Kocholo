Pentair is a global water, fluid, thermal management, and equipment protection company with industry-leading products, services, and solutions. In 2013, Pentair achieved sales of USD 7.5 billion. Since its origins, Pentair has evolved from a holding company to a diversified industrial manufacturing company. This evolution meant that it needed to change the way it managed its operations, and to gain greater insight over the data and processes used in each area of its businesses. In 2012, while the HR standardization initiative was underway, Pentair also completed a merger with Tyco Flow Control, and the company doubled in size overnight. It grew from a $4 billion to a nearly $8 billion sales company, and from 15,000 to 30,000 employees.

In 2009, Pentairâ€™s HR function began working towards this global standardization objective. The HR team saw an opportunity to replace a number of localized systems and spreadsheet-based processes with a single, integrated solution based on Oracle PeopleSoft Human Capital Management software.
