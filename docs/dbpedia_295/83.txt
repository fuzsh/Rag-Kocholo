THE National Benzole Association now presents its sixth annual report embodying the results of certain technological investigations carried out under the auspices of a joint research committee of this Association and of the University of Leeds. The term ‘benzole’ is used in this report to indicate the mixture of hydrocarbons, mainly aromatic, which is ordinarily recovered from coal gas or coke-oven gas for use as motor spirit.
