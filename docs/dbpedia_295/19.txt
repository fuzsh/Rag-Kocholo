National Line (National Steam Navigation Company)

The National Line (National Steam Navigation Company) was a Liverpool shipping company which existed between 1863 and 1914. Established in Liverpool in 1863 with a view to link this port to the Southern US but changed to New York because of the Civil War. In any case the idea was to use iron screw steamers transporting cargo as well as passengers (emigrants, mainly). Competitors were Cunard, Guion, Anchor and Inman; the National Line did rather well till about 1880 thanks to its emphasis on freight and numbers of passengers (large ships) rather than speed.

Other ports linked were London-New York (1870) and Boston. National Line had twelve ships in 1879, four of which were then commandeered for the Zulu Wars. One moment of glory occurred when the America  for two months  held the Blue Riband (1884). The sailings to New York were discontinued in 1892. In 1896, the Atlantic Transport Line took over National Line which would only carry freight from then on, as it had already done on the London-New York route anyway. The end came in 1914 through voluntary liquidation.

https://research.mysticseaport.org/item/l011061/l011061-c008/32/ Formed in Sunderland in 1881 by F & W. Ritson to operate a tramp shipping service, but in 1899 the company inaugurated a liner service between the U.K and Chile, Peru and Ecuador. The high cost of replacing war losses between 1914 and 1918 and the worldwide trade depression of the 1920s caused the end of the company and it was wound up in 1931.

All the ships operated by the company were named for trees as "... Branch": "Almond Branch", "Apple Branch", "Cedar Branch", "Cherry Branch", "Elder Branch", "Elm Branch", "Hazel Branch", "Holly Branch", "Laurel Branch", "Lime Branch", "Maple Branch", "Myrtle Branch", "Oak Branch", "Olive Branch", "Orange Branch", "Palm Branch", "Pear Branch", "Pine Branch", "Plum Branch", "Poplar Branch", "Vine Branch", and "Willow Branch".
