        "text": "CONDITIONS OF BUSINESS (ON-LINE)\n\nInformation for Buyers\n\n1. Introduction\n\n1.1 The following informative notes are intended to assist Bidders and Buyers and form part of our Conditions of Business, including the Information for Buyers, Conditions of Sale and the Terms of Consignment for Sellers, which are readily available for inspection on our web-site (www.cheffins.co.uk) and at our offices. All Bidders and Buyers will be deemed to have read and accepted these terms and conditions prior to bidding. Our staff will be happy to help you if there is anything you do not fully understand.\n\n1.2 Please refer to Clause 1 of the Conditions of Sale if you are unsure about the meaning of any defined term.\n\n1.3 Except where the context otherwise requires words denoting the singular include the plural and vice versa. Words denoting one gender include all genders and words denoting persons include corporations and vice versa.\n\n1.4 The Auctioneers may supplement or supersede these Conditions in whole or part with Special Conditions applicable to a specific sale or Lot which will be announced at the time of sale. No employee or agent of the Auctioneers has any authority to vary these Conditions.\n\n2. Buyers Premium\n\n2.1 All purchases will be subject to a buyer’s premium as stated in the foreword or special conditions on all Lots sold by auction or by private treaty:\n\nThe Buyer’s Premium will be subject to a minimum charge of £2.50 plus VAT per Lot and to the Conditions below.\n\n2.2 VAT at the standard rate will be charged on all charges except those detailed in 4.2 below.\n\n3. Entry to the Sale Site\n\n3.1 Any person entering the Sale Site does so at their own risk.\n\n3.2 Any person entering the Sale Site must comply with the requirements of all Health and Safety notices.\n\n3.3 The Auctioneers reserve the right to refuse admission to any person or entry of any Lots in to the Sale without giving any reason.\n\n4. Value Added Tax\n\n4.1 VAT at the standard UK rate will be added to the hammer price on all Lots unless the Lot is sold under either the Margin Scheme (including second hand vehicles) or the Auctioneers’ Margin Scheme when VAT will not be added separately to the hammer price. Under the Margin Scheme or the Auctioneers’ Margin Scheme, the Buyer’s Premium will be shown inclusive of VAT which cannot be reclaimed as input tax. The Auctioneers may choose, entirely at their discretion, to use one or both of these Schemes in any Auction for eligible items. Lots included under one of these schemes will be marked in the catalogue with either an ‘M’ or an ‘A’. The only other exception will be in the case of ‘zero-rated’ or ‘exempt’ items which will be marked in the catalogue with either a ‘Z’ or an ‘E’ and will not attract VAT. Prospective Purchasers should check with the Auctioneers before bidding if they are unsure in to which category any Lot falls. Full details of both the Margin Scheme and the Auctioneers’ Margin Scheme can be found on the HMRC website www.hmrc.gov.uk notices 718, 718/1 and 718/2.\n\n4.2 Purchasers from the European Community countries outside the UK who are registered for VAT or its equivalent in their member state will be required to supply the Auctioneers with their VAT/FISCAL number and a copy of their VAT registration certificate. Once the VAT number and customer details have been checked by the Auctioneers with the Europa website, any standard rated items, together with any Buyer’s Premium charged thereon, may be zero rated for UK VAT purposes. The zero rating of items purchased is also subject to the auctioneers receiving valid proof that the items have been removed from the UK and delivered to the Purchaser’s address in another EU member state within the required time limits. If acceptable evidence is not received within these time limits, VAT at the standard UK rate will become payable and will not be recoverable by the purchaser. Details of the evidence required and the time limits are available from the Auctioneer’s office. A VAT Deposit equivalent to the UK standard rate of VAT may be taken in some circumstances entirely at the discretion of the Auctioneers. Once all the required evidence of removal from the UK has been received within the time limits, this Deposit will be returned to the Purchaser. If the evidence is not received on time or is insufficient, the VAT Deposit will be paid over to HMRC as VAT. Where any of the above VAT registration information is not made available to the Auctioneers or where the Purchaser is not VAT registered for VAT in their member state, VAT at the standard UK rate will be charged on all standard rated items and this will not be recoverable.\n\n4.3 Overseas Purchasers, from countries outside the European Community, will be required to pay a VAT Deposit equivalent to the standard UK rate of VAT. This amount of VAT Deposit will be refunded to the overseas purchaser if the Auctioneers receive satisfactory evidence of export within the required time limit. Details of the evidence required and the time limits are available from the Auctioneers office and will include original copies of the relevant Export Lodgement Advice and a satisfactory Bill of Lading or Certificate of Shipment clearly identifying the goods. If acceptable documents are not received within the relevant time limits, the VAT Deposit will be paid directly to HMRC as VAT.\n\n5. Description and Condition of Lots\n\n5.1 As agents for the Seller, the Auctioneers are primarily dependant on the information provided by the Seller and any statement, written or verbal, made by the Auctioneers in respect of any Lot as to genuineness, origin, date, age, provenance, condition or estimated selling price, including condition reports which may be provided at the Buyer’s request, is a statement of opinion held by the Auctioneers. It is, however, deemed that prospective Buyers have inspected the Lots on which they intend to bid at pre-arranged viewings. Accordingly, the Auctioneers accept bids from potential Buyers on the basis that the Buyers (or their advisors) have fully inspected the Lot prior to bidding and have satisfied themselves prior to bidding in relation to the condition and accuracy of the description of the Lot.\n\nThe nature of the Lots sold at Auction is such that they will rarely be in perfect condition and are likely, due to their nature and age, to show signs of wear and tear, damage, or other imperfections, restoration or repair. Any reference to condition by the Cheffins will not amount to a full description of condition. Photographs included in Cheffins’ sale catalogues or on the website, are not representative of the condition of any Lot.\n\nAll Lots are sold ‘as seen’ with all faults and errors of description. Purchasers should satisfy themselves prior to the sale as to the condition of each Lot and should exercise and rely on their own judgement as to whether the Lot accords to its description. Neither the Auctioneers, their servants nor agents are responsible for errors of description or for the genuineness or authenticity of any Lot. No warranty is given by the Auctioneers, their servants or agents or by any Vendor to any Purchaser in respect of any Lot and any express or implied conditions or warranties are excluded to the fullest extent permitted by law.\n\nCheffins draw the Buyer’s attention to the exclusion of liability for the condition of Lots contained in the Conditions of Sale. Neither the seller nor Cheffins as the Auctioneers, accept any responsibility for the condition of any Lot.\n\n5.2 Certain machines could contain hazardous substances such as blue and white asbestos, dangerous chemicals and other hazardous substances which, if not handled correctly and disposed of correctly, could be in breach of Health and Safely at Work Act 1974, Control of Substances Hazardous to Health Regulations 1988 (COSHH) or other current legislation. The buyer undertakes to handle and dispose of correctly, any toxic chemicals and dangerous substances and to indemnify the Auctioneers against any failure to observe these undertakings.\n\n6. Bidding\n\n6.1 Bidders are required to register on Cheffins on-line bidding platform and will be required to pay a deposit, the amount of which will be stated in the specific conditions of sale or foreword. Lots will only be invoiced to the name and address on the Purchasers Registration Form and cannot be transferred to another name and address. Cheffins can only accept payment from the registered Bidder.\n\n6.2 Commission Bids may be left online by a Bidder indicating the maximum amount to be bid (excluding VAT and Buyers Premium and any other charges which may apply). Subject to the reserve price of the Lot and any other bids received, the sale may be concluded for less than the maximum bid. The Bidder will not have any claim against the Auctioneers or their employees if for any reason the commission bid is not executed. If two bidders submit identical bids, the first bid received has priority.\n\n6.3 A deposit of between £250 and £2500 (variable dependent on sale type) will be required via their debit card prior to bidding\n\nThe Auctioneers reserve the right to refuse the registration of a bidder entirely at their discretion.\n\n7. Payment\n\n7.1. All Lots purchased through the on-line bidding platform must be paid for by the purchaser within one week of the end of the sale\n\n7.2 We accept the following methods of payment:\n\nBank Transfer- direct to our bankers at Barclays Bank PLC, St Andrews Street, Cambridge\n\nSort Code: 20-17-68\n\nAccount Number: 50237698\n\nSwift Code: BARC GB 22\n\nIBAN: GB43 BARC 2017 6850 2376 98\n\nPlease quote your buyers number or name as reference\n\nCheques- Cheques are accepted entirely at the Auctioneer’s discretion and any cheques tendered\n\nwill need to be cleared before removal of the Lot is permitted (please note you must allow 6\n\nworking days for a cheque to clear).\n\nDebit Cards- Payments can be made in person at the Machinery Saleground office or over the telephone.\n\n7.3 Sold Lots can only be released to the Buyer on Cheffins’ receipt of payment in full and cleared funds of the invoice total.\n\n7.4 As provided by the Late Payment of Commercial Debts (Interest) Act 1998, the Auctioneers reserve the right to charge the Buyer interest at 8% above the prevailing base rate set at the time by the Bank of England, for any unpaid account.\n\n7.5 If an account remains unpaid and legal action is taken by the Auctioneers in order to obtain payment, the Auctioneers reserve the right to demand in full from the Buyer, all legal, professional and associated costs resulting from such action.\n\n8. Export of Goods\n\n8.1 Any Lot purchased at Auction may be subject to export restrictions or may require a licence for export out of the United Kingdom, for example depending on the age and value of the Lot or if the Lot contains organic or endangered materials that are restricted from export (Please refer to 5.3 above).\n\n8.2 The Buyer is responsible for obtaining any licences which may be required (including any licence that may be required for import onto the destination country). The delay or denial of any such licence will not be grounds for the Buyer to cancel any purchase.\n\n8.3 At the Buyers’ request, we can assist in the application for the export of goods outside of the UK.\n\n9. Collection and Storage\n\n9.1 Please note that all Lots must be paid for in accordance with Clause 7 above. Lots cannot be released until payment (including Buyer’s Premium and VAT where applicable) has been received by the Auctioneers in full and cleared funds for all items purchased. Any delay of payment may result in the Buyer incurring storage charges.\n\n9.2 Collection of Lots is the Buyer’s sole responsibility. Buyers will be required to produce proof of identity on collection of the Lot.\n\n9.3 Any Lot which, without the express written consent of the Auctioneers, has not been collected within the time stated on the specific conditions of sale will be subject to a £25/day storage charge prior to collection\n\n9.4 Lots purchased at Cheffins on-site venues will be subject to special collection/clearance terms which will be published in the appropriate auction catalogue.\n\n10. Inspection of Goods\n\nAll Lots are sold with all faults and imperfections and errors of description. Purchasers should satisfy themselves prior to the sale of the Lots as to the condition of each Lot and should exercise and rely on their own judgement as to whether the Lot accords to its description. Neither the Auctioneers, their staff or agents are responsible for errors of description or for the genuineness or authenticity of any Lot. No warranty is given by the Auctioneers, their staff or agents or by any Vendor to any Purchaser in respect of any Lot and any express or implied conditions or warranties are excluded to the fullest extent permitted by law.\n\n11. Insurance\n\nThe Auctioneers are unable to provide insurance on any Lot in the sale. The Purchaser is responsible for insuring any item with effect from the time the item is successfully purchased on-line\n\n12. Compliance with Road Traffic Acts, the Health and Safety at Work Act and all other Acts and Regulations applicable to Farm Safety\n\n12.1 The Purchaser of any vehicle or trailer is responsible for complying with all legal requirements as to the construction and the use of such vehicle or trailer and for obtaining all certificates, permits or other authorisation necessary before such vehicle or trailer can be used on the road.\n\n12.2 The Purchaser of any Lot is responsible for complying with all legal requirements regarding the safe use of items purchased at a sale and shall ensure compliance with all relevant legislation relating to the safe use of any item.\n\n13. Auctioneer’s Right to Annul Sales\n\nIn the event of any dispute or refusal to pay or of non-payment on the part of the Purchaser, the Auctioneers may, entirely at their discretion, annul and cancel the sale of such Lot or Lots.\n\n14. Agency\n\nThe Auctioneers act as agent for the Seller whose identity, for reasons of confidentiality, is not normally disclosed to the Buyer. If a Buyer purchases at Auction, the Contract of Sale is made directly between the Buyer and the Seller."
