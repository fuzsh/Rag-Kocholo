        "text": "It is our belief that when buying decorative pieces, that when possible, \"the genuine article\", is always preferable to a reproduction. There are several reasons for this; most notably, that reproduction products are often mass produced, made from cheap materials, are poorly constructed; these are essentially built to be disposable products that can be displayed for a few years, but will eventually end up in a thrift store or landfill. On the other hand, original items were generally built to last, which is why so many of the advertising signs from the 1930's, 1940's, and some even earlier than that, are still around today. Furthermore, as these items age, and become harder to find as time goes on, they will often appreciate in value, meaning that often times these items can be sold in the future, for a higher price than they were originally purchased for. We call these appreciable type items, \"investment quality collectibles\", and at ArtFactory.com, we specialize in only original, vintage collectible memorabilia, that are of investment quality, with future appreciable value. This original 1970's disco ball is not only the perfect way to set the mood for your vintage dance party, but also is an appreciable asset that will add to your financial net worth!\n\nMirrored Disco Balls Historical Information\n\nThe disco ball, also known as a mirror ball or glitter ball, has become an iconic symbol of the disco era and its unique style of music and dancing. The history of the disco ball dates back to the early 20th century, when small glass mirrors were first used to decorate dresses and other clothing. In the 1920s, a German company called Zeiss-Ikon created the first true disco ball. They called it a \"spiegelkugel,\" which literally translates to \"mirror ball.\" These early disco balls were made of hundreds of small mirrors that were mounted on a sphere-shaped frame. They were used primarily in dance halls and clubs in Europe, and they quickly became popular for their ability to reflect light and create a dazzling visual effect on the dance floor.\n\nIn the 1930s and 1940s, disco balls became more popular in the United States, particularly in New York City. They were used in jazz clubs and ballrooms, and they were often accompanied by special lighting effects to create a more immersive experience for dancers. In the 1960s and 1970s, the disco ball reached the height of its popularity. It became a staple of the disco era, which was characterized by its flashy style, upbeat music, and energetic dancing. Disco balls were often used in conjunction with other lighting effects, such as strobe lights and colored spotlights, to create a psychedelic atmosphere on the dance floor.\n\nToday, disco balls are still used in dance clubs and other venues around the world. They have become a symbol of disco culture and are often used as a decorative element in theme parties and other events. While the design of the disco ball has evolved over the years, the basic concept remains the same: to create a dazzling display of light and color that enhances the music and creates a festive atmosphere for dancers and party-goers alike."
