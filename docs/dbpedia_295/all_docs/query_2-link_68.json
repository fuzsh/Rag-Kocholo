        "text": "Chemical analyses of soil\n\nThe choice of study plots location and, consequently, of soil material sampling sites, was determined considering the variability of soil contamination with organic compounds. The material for chemical analyses was collected from top soil layers (0–20 cm). Soil samples were randomly taken from five points at each of the study plots. To interpret the results, a mixed sample was used, which consisted of all combined samples from a given site. Basic physical, chemical and biological characteristics were determined in the soil material.\n\nIn terms of the soil’s physical properties, soil granulometric composition was determined aerometrically as well as dry matter at 105°C. In terms of the basic soil chemical properties, the organic carbon content was determined in the TOC apparatus, pH in H2O and KCl–potentiometrically, nitrogen content was determined by Kjeldahl method, hydrolytic acidity by the Kappen method, while the exchangeable cations content, after extraction with 1M ammonium acetate solution at pH 7, by the AAS technique (atomic absorption spectrometry).\n\nVolatile organic compounds, including benzene, ethylbenzene, toluene, meta- and para-xylene, ortho-xylene, styrene, sum of BTEX, sum of xylenes, sum of BTEXS, were determined by a method based on the US EPA 8260, US EPA 5021, US EPA 5021, US EPA 8015 and MADEP 2004 rev. 1.1, ISO 15009 by gas chromatography with the FID and MS detection.\n\nPolycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), including: anthracene, benzo(a)anthracene, benzo(a)pyrene, benzo(b)fluoranthene, benzo(g.h.i.)perylene, benzo(k)fluoranthene, chryzene, dibenzo(a.h)anthracene, indeno(1.2.3.cd)pyrene and naphthalene were determined by the S-PAHGMS01 method based on the US EPA 8270, ISO 18287. Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons were extracted with hexane and determined by gas chromatography with the MS or MS / MS detector.\n\nEcological analyses\n\nSoil invertebrates, including springtails are found mainly in the top layer of soil in a layer of roots. Therefore, by the majority of researchers, the samples were taken using steel corer to a depth of 0- 10cm. Springtails Hexapoda, Collembola were used for ecological analyses. They play an important role in the processes of mineralization and humification of the organic matter. Due to the role of springtails in ecosystems, as well as their response (decrease in abundance, change in dominant structure, species diversity) to pollution, they are considered to be good ecological indicators of health and contamination level of soils. In the laboratory, springtails were extracted from the soil samples in the MacFadyen apparatus, and then preserved in 70% ethylene alcohol. The duration of exposure to light and temperature (25 W bulbs) was 24 h. The springtails were counted and classified into ecological groups based on the characteristics proposed by Christiansen [23], Fjelberg [24–25] and Stach [26]. Ecological risk was analyzed spatially using the Spatial Analysis and Decision Assistance programme, adapted to assess hazards resulting from various factors, not only from radioactive contamination [27].\n\nThe programme enables creating a two- and three-dimensional maps of contamination distribution in the screened areas, conducting statistical analyses, developing decontamination scenarios and determining the level of risk for people and the environment [28]. This application is focused on spatial study and designing soil remediation procedures.\n\nStatistical analyses with the aim to determine links between the individual features were performed using correlation analysis and principal component analysis (PCA). The significance level in all analyses was adopted at 0.05. Statistical analyses with the aim to determine links between the individual features were performed using correlation analysis, principal component analysis (PCA) and cluster analysis. The statistical analyses were made with the use of Statistica 13 programme.\n\nChemical analyses\n\nThe physico-chemical characteristics of soils was based on the results of the above described analyses. The soils were segmented into material classes according to the PN-86/B-02480 standard. Depending on the granulometric composition established, there were clay sands in the case of soil samples Nos 2–6, sandy clay in sample No. 1, and loose sand in sample No. 7.\n\nThe results of physico-chemical analysis of soils are given in Table 1. The pH values ranged from 4.23 to 7.79. A distinctly higher pH values were found in soils Nos 4 and 5 as compared to the other soils. Large variation in the value of sum of exchangeable base cations (S) implied the variability of the soil sorption capacity (T). The highest value was found in soil No. 4, owing to its alkaline reaction. The soils examined were characterized by a low content of nitrogen (N) and carbon (C). Carbonates (CaCO3) were found in two samples solely.\n\nThe similarity of the soils examined with respect to all features is presented in the form of dendrogram (Fig 2). As results from clustering, the highest discrepancies for physical and chemical propertieswere found insoils No. 1 and No. 5 compared to the remaining soils.\n\nThe content of volatile organic compounds was found to differ between the study plots examined (Table 2). Considering the individual study plots, volatile organic compounds was detected only in soils found in the vicinity of the active benzole storage site (plot No. 1), and the ethylene plant (plot No. 5). However, no significant effect on the soil VOC content was noted of either the ethylene storage site (plot No. 4) or the benzole installation (plot No. 2).\n\nThe highest content of volatile organic compounds was determined in the top soil layer sampled from plot No. 1, including: toluene (0.279 mg.kg-1), meta & para xylene (0.165 mg.kg-1), ortho-xylene (0.069 mg.kg-1), BTEX sum (0.732 mg.kg-1), BTEXS sum (0.732 mg.kg-1) and sum of xylene (0.234 mg.kg-1). They were released to the soil from the benzole storage site. On the other hand, no volatile aromatic compounds were detected in the soil sampled from plot No. 3, where the benzole storage used to be a source of contamination in the past, since the area was reclaimed, after the tank had been excluded from use.\n\nThe benzene installation (plot No. 2) and the liquid ethylene storage (plot No. 4) did not release VOC into the environment, thus no soil contamination with these compounds was noted. The highest contents of benzene (0.710 mg.kg-1), ethylbenzene (0.950 mg.kg-1), BTEX sum (1.660 mg.kg-1) and BTEXS (1.660 mg.kg-1) were determined in the soil sampled from plot No. 5, where the former ethylbenzene installation was located. The content of VOC in the other soils fluctuated at the level of values referred to as the so-called geochemical background (Table 3).\n\nThe PAHs content varied between soils collected from the selected study plots. Quantitatively, it can be represented in the following series: 1> 4> 3> 7> 2> 6> 5, what proves that the content of soil PAHs depended primarily on the sampling site, and thus on the source of pollutant release.\n\nPlot No. 1 (benzole storage) was characterized by a much higher content of the PAHs compared to the other areas, with benzo(b)fluoranthene having the largest share (24.91%) and benzo(k)fluoranthene–the lowest (0.08%). Likewise, a high content of the PAHs was found in the soil sampled from plot No. 4, where the liquid ethylene storage was the source of contamination. A slightly lower content of PAHs was recorded in the soil from plot No. 3, where the benzole storage (currently excluded from use) was located.\n\nBenzo(b)fluoranthene had the largest share among all the PAHs identified in soils on the study plots, while naphthalene the smallest one. In the remaining soils collected from plots Nos. 2, 5, 6 and 7, the contents of the above compounds were relatively low. Based on the results obtained, it can be stated that soil contamination in the vicinity of the laboratory and the former installation of ethylbenzene was lowest compared to the other investigated locations.\n\nThe results of principal component analysis (Fig 3) showed a very strong correlation between anthracene, benzo(a)pyrene and the sum of PAHs (these features overlap in the chart). At the same time, the above three compounds were strongly correlated with toluene, while benzene and ethylbenzene were not related to PAHs.\n\nPhytotoxicity assessment\n\nStimulation of root extension was observed in all the plants examined, except for Lepidium sativum and Sorghum saccharatum growing on soil taken from plot No. 4 whose PAHs content was relatively high (Table 4).\n\nThe root extension stimulation ranged from 0.15% to 55.6% compared to the OECD reference soil. The most likely cause of this phenomenon is a much higher amount of biogenic substances present in the natural soil samples compared to the OECD artificial soil. Mustard turned out to be the most susceptible to soil contamination. In the case of sorghum seedlings, inhibition of root extension for soils from plots Nos 2 and 5 was found to be 22.8% and 32.7%, respectively. Based on the correlation coefficients determined (Table 5), there was a positive relationship between benzene and ethylbenzene in the case of inhibition of root extension in Lepidium sativum and Sorghum saccharatum. These correlations were negative for the remaining compounds. The inhibition of root elongation decreased with the increase in the content of organic compounds, however, the correlations were insignificant.\n\nDicot plants were observed to react differently than the monocot ones, depending on the pollutants tested. Benzene and ethylbenzene stimulated root extension in monocotyls (S. saccharatum), while anthracene, benzo(a)pyrene and the sum of PAHs–in dicotyls (S. alba). Both groups of plants reacted similarly only in the case of toluene, however, the correlations were not significant. Similar relations were found by Gworek et al. [29], in the study comparing the PAHs uptake by selected species of monocot and dicot plants.\n\nThe above authors reported that monocots accumulated PAHs in the roots, to what testifies the significant correlation between the contents of fluorene, phenanthrene and anthracene in the plant material. On the other hand, in dicotyls, where the correlation was negligible, PAHs accumulated both in roots and leaves of plants.\n\nThe inhibition of test plants germination was only slightly affected by the diversified content of contaminants in the soil (Table 6). The highest impact on the germination level (17.6% of stimulation) was observed in the case of sorghum in the control soil, sampled from the meadow and from plot No. 3 (reclaimed area). For the remaining soils, a reduction in germination of about 5–10% was determined for the other two species tested.\n\nBased on the determined correlation coefficients (Table 7), both positive and negative relationships between individual compounds were found. However, no general trend could be determined.\n\nPhytotoxicity assays are used as environmental tools to assess the contamination of environmental compartments. The impact of soil contamination on plants depends on many factors, such as concentrations and properties of pollutants, exposure time, species of plants and soil properties [30–31]. One of the most important soil properties, which controls the bioavailability of hydrophobic organic pollutants, including PAHs, is the content of organic matter [32].\n\nEcological assessment\n\nSpringtails provide a good tool for assessing hardly measurable and time-varying parameters as well as a source of additional information which facilitates the assessment of ecological effects and trends occurring in the environment [33–35]. The collembols as either single species, various ecological groups or whole assemblages are of indicatory value due to their high sensitivity to changes in soil chemical properties, such as: soil acidification, accumulation of heavy metals and other toxic compounds [36].The occurrence of collembols is also affected by soil pH, humidity, aeration and humus content. Most springtails were detected in soils sampled from plots Nos 2 and 5, while the least in soils from plot No. 3 (Fig 4). Soils sampled from plots No. 1 and No. 7 were found to contain few individuals of Collembola. It seems interesting that no springtails were found in one of the reference samples (No. 6), likewise in the reclaimed area (plot No. 3) where they were not detected either.\n\nBased on the correlation coefficients determined (Table 8), it was found that an increase in the content of chemical compounds in the soil resulted in the increase in the numbers of Isotomiella minor.\n\nThere were also significant correlations between the content of benzene and ethylbenzene and the numbers of Proisotoma minuta, Schoetella uniunguiculata and Sminthurus viridis.\n\nHowever, the interpretation of the results obtained at the present stage is extremely difficult, due to the fact that the springtails reaction to contamination is not unambiguous. For example, Bengtsson et al. [37] found that Collembola tended to significantly decrease in numbers as a result of soil contamination by heavy metals, whereas the opposite relationship was demonstrated by Migliorini et al. [38]. This indicates that the response of collembols to contamination is subject to numerous factors. Environmental conditions can significantly affect the response of springtails, and in particular, soil moisture and temperature, since these invertebrates are particularly sensitive to the above factors [36, 39–40]. The long-lasting contamination may result in an increase in the proportion of parthenogenetic species of springtails having a short life cycle, such as Isotomiella minor and Parisotoma notabilis [41]. Siepel [42] provided evidence that the above species were abundant in soils contaminated with heavy metals.\n\nThe occurrence of PAHs was positively associated with the occurrence of Isotomiella minor collembols, while the presence of benzene and ethylbenzene was positively correlated with Proisotoma minuta collembols, what may suggest that the above collembol species show a low sensitivity to contamination with these compounds (Fig 3). On the other hand, there was a negative relationship between PAHs, benzene and ethylbenzene and the occurrence of Parisotoma notabilis collembols."
