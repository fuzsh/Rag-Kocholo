Established in Liverpool in 1863 with a view to link this port to the Southern US but changed to New York because of the Civil War. In any case the idea was to use iron screw steamers transporting cargo as well as passengers (emigrants, mainly). Competitors were Cunard, Guion, Anchor and Inman; the National Line did rather well till about 1880 thanks to its emphasis on freight and numbers of passengers (large ships) rather than speed.\n\nOther ports linked were London-New York (1870) and Boston. National Line had twelve ships in 1879, four of which were then commandeered for the Zulu Wars. One moment of glory occurred when the America  for two months  held the Blue Riband (1884). The sailings to New York were discontinued in 1892. In 1896, the Atlantic Transport Line took over National Line which would only carry freight from then on, as it had already done on the London-New York route anyway. The end came in 1914 through voluntary liquidation.\n\nSources:\n\nhttp://www.theshipslist.com/ships/lines/national.html\n\nhttp://www.diduknow.info/emigrants/media/emigration_usa.rtf\n\nhttp://www.mersey-gateway.org.uk/yesterdays/server.php?show=ConWebDoc.1192\n\nThe house flag is red, a white cross throughout and a union jack in the centre, as shown at www.mysticseaport.org, No. 1804 National Steam Ship Co., Ltd., London.\n\nJan Mertens, 27 November 2005\n\nNational Power plc.\n\nimage by Jarig Bakker, 10 November 2005, modified by André Coutanche\n\nNational Power PLC., London - white flag, blue disk, charged with red \"P\" and a white N resembling a lightning flash.\n\nSource: Loughran (1995)\n\nJarig Bakker, 10 November 2005\n\nNational Steam Trawling Co., Ltd.\n\nimage by Ivan Sache, 4 May 2021\n\nLloyd's Book of House Flags and Funnels (1912) shows the house flag of National Steam Trawling Co., Ltd.

The high cost of replacing war losses between 1914 and 1918 and the worldwide trade depression of the 1920s caused the end of the company and it was wound up in 1931.\n\nAll the ships operated by the company were named for trees as \"...
