        "text": "Louise Evelyn Fletcher was the widow of Christie West Fletcher. She lived at 996 Denman Street from 1918 to 1926.\n\nEarly Life\n\nLouise Evelyn Fletcher was born Louise Evelyn Conway on July 3, 1878 in Yarmouth, Hampshire, England. Her parents were William and Jane Conway.\n\nMarriage to Christie Fletcher\n\nIn 1908, in Wandsworth, London, England, Louise married Christie West Fletcher. He was born on December 12, 1874, in Kew, London, England. His parents were Charles and Lucy Fletcher. Charles Fletcher was a member of the London Stock Exchange.\n\nChristie had attended Lord Williams’s Grammar School in Thame, Oxfordshire. He became an indigo planter in India and then he served with Lumsden’s Horse in the Boer War. He later became an electrician.\n\nTo Canada\n\nIn September 1909, Charles came to Canada. He travelled through Quebec City on his way to Whonnock, British Columbia.\n\nIn February 1911, Louise and her daughter, Lucy, travelled to Halifax, Nova Scotia, on the Tunisian. They were heading to Vancouver.\n\nIn Vancouver\n\nFrom 1912 to 1915, the Fletchers lived on East 32 Avenue in Vancouver.\n\nIn 1912, they were at 141 East 32 Ave.; from 1913, they lived at 162 East 32 Ave.\n\nChristie was an electrician with the British Columbia Electric Railway.\n\nMilitary Service\n\nIn December 1914, Christie enlisted with the Canadian Expeditionary Force.\n\nHe served with the British Columbia Regiment of the Canadian Infantry.\n\nHe died in France on September 30, 1916.\n\nCanadian Patriotic Fund\n\nFrom about 1918 to 1923, Louise was an employee of the Canadian Patriotic Fund, which collected money to support the families of soldiers.\n\nThe Vancouver office of the fund was at number 326, 736 Granville Street.\n\nCharles Herbert Bonnor (1870-1929), an accountant, was the local secretary of the fund.\n\nThere were many predecessors of the Canadian Patriotic Fund. During the Boer War, an association appeared in Ottawa to create a fund to look after wives, children and dependants who were separated at home from those serving in South Africa. Other purposes of the fund were to look after soldiers and their families when the soldiers became wounded or sick while serving, as well as the widows, orphans, and other dependants of soldiers who died. The federal parliament established a more formal corporation to support these objectives: An Act to incorporate the Canadian Patriotic Fund Association, Statutes of Canada, 1901, chapter 92; amended by Statutes of Canada, 1908, chapter 96; and Statutes of Canada, 1909, chapter 67.\n\nDesmond Morton’s book, Fight or Pay, Soldiers’ Families in the Great War, Vancouver, University of British Columbia Press, 2004, describes the scheme in the First World War. With the leadership of Sir Herbert Ames of Montreal, the federal government established a Canadian Patriotic Fund in 1914. The fund used a combination of private and public money to support its activities.\n\nAlthough the fund did help, it was not perfect. There were strong social pressures to contribute to the fund, although the contributors may have had very little themselves. Even so, many families did not receive enough to support them. The administrators of the payments often intruded into private family lives to determine appropriate levels of payments. The federal government eventually took over many aspects of support for families of military personnel.\n\nWhen the Second World War began in 1939, the federal parliament passed legislation to create a new Canadian Patriotic Fund [The Canadian Patriotic Fund Act, 1939, Statutes of Canada, 1939 (Second Session), chapter 1.]\n\nLouise’s Later Years\n\nIn the 1921 Canada census, Louise and her children, Lucy and Christie, were living at 996 Denman Street.\n\nIn the late 1920s, they were at apartment 10 at 920 Bidwell Street.\n\nIn the 1930s they lived in Douglas Lodge Apartments, at the northwest corner of Granville Street and West 12th Avenue.\n\nIn 1939, Louise went to England to visit Lucy, who had recently been married to Henry Stafford Challis.\n\nTo Australia\n\nLouise and her son, Christie, later lived in Australia.\n\nIn 1954, Louise was with Christie and his wife, Betty, at 7 Allars Street in Eastwood [Denistone West] in New South Wales. Australia.\n\nIn 1958, Louise was in Waverley, East Sydney, New South Wales.\n\nLouise died in South Australia on June 8, 1961.\n\nChristie and Louise had the following children.\n\nLucy Evelyn Fletcher\n\nLucy Evelyn Fletcher was born in Wandsworth, London, England on March 27, 1909.\n\nShe lived with her mother in Vancouver until about 1938. According to some sources, Lucy attended the University of British Columbia. She also worked as a stenographer with the Canadian Bank of Commerce.\n\nIn 1938, in London, England, Lucy married Henry Stafford Challis, who was a chartered company secretary. He was born in White Hart Lane, Tottenham, Middlesex, England on October 29, 1910. His parents were Edward and Emma Challis. Edward Challis was a clerk for an umbrella manufacturer.\n\nIn 1939, Henry and Lucy were living in flat 15 at 29 Westbourne Terrace in Paddington, London.\n\nDuring the Second World War, Henry served with the British military forces, and he flew briefly with the Royal Air Force.\n\nIn 1941, Lucy was one of five members of the Beaver Club who provided “genuine Canadian accents” in a British war propaganda movie called “49th Parallel.” (The movie was called “The Invaders” when it appeared in the United States.)\n\nThe Beaver Club was a gathering place and recreation centre for Canadian troops on leave or in camp in England during the Second World War.\n\nThe movie opened in Vancouver in January 1942.\n\nThe movie is available on YouTube: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TftqNmFAHJE: “A World War II U-boat crew are stranded in northern Canada. To avoid internment, they must make their way to the border and get into the still-neutral U.S.”\n\nFrom the mid-1940s, Henry Stafford Challis worked for a company sometimes known as Berger Paints in Calcutta, India.\n\nIn 1950, Lucy and her children, Stafford and Amanda, sailed from Southampton, England to Bombay, India.\n\nIn 1953 and 1956, Henry, Lucy, and Amanda travelled from London to Bombay.\n\nLucy died on March 14, 1967.\n\nHenry died in Manchester, England on May 6, 2006.\n\nChristie William Fletcher\n\nChristie William Fletcher was born in Vancouver on September 13, 1913.\n\nHe lived in Vancouver with his mother until 1935.\n\nWhile he was a student at the University of British Columbia, he was the treasurer of the Players’ Club and the sports editor at the Ubyssey, the university’s student newspaper. He graduated in 1935 with a Bachelor of Commerce degree.\n\nTo Australia\n\nIn 1938, in Mosman, New South Wales, Christie married Marcelle Stella Le Claire, an actor who was also known as Marcelle Marnay.\n\nMarcelle was born in France on December 31, 1919. She was best known for her role in a 1936 Australian film called “Uncivilised” (spelled “Uncivilized” in North America).\n\nChristie served with the Australian military forces during the Second World War.\n\nIn 1944, Marcelle was a beautician in Spit Junction, a suburb of Mosman, New South Wales.\n\nMarcelle’s Marriage to Stu Mallon\n\nIt appears that Christie’s and Marcelle’s marriage ended in divorce.\n\nBy the mid-1940s, Marcelle was married to Stewart (sometimes “Stuart” or “Stu”) Eugene Mallon, who was a United States military serviceman. Stewart was born in Kansas City, Missouri on January 31, 1922.\n\nStewart had a colourful and sometimes troubled life. In 1940, he was working for the Western Pipe and Steel Company. (His father was a paymaster for the company.) He was upset over a failed love affair, and he tried to end his life by jumping from a ferry boat. A nearby water taxi rescued him.\n\nStewart had a boxing career before he went overseas with the United States military service.\n\nIn 1944, the South Australian Police Gazette reported that Stewart was absent from the United States Army.\n\nHis absence appears to have been resolved, because he later continued his military service.\n\nStewart continued his boxing career; he also became a hair stylist and clothing designer.\n\nIn May 1946, Stewart broke his jaw during a fight in Sydney, Australia.\n\nBy June 1947, Stewart (and probably Marcelle) had moved to California, where Stu resumed his boxing career for a time.\n\nMarcelle became ill, and she died in San Mateo, California, on February 4, 1951.\n\nStuart later worked at a variety of jobs. He also had a series of legal difficulties involving assault and fraud.\n\nStewart married Rosetta Ross on August 4, 1952. They had a son, who was called Michael John Mallon and John Michael Ross.\n\nStewart and Rosetta lived briefly in Reno, Nevada.\n\nStewart’s and Rosetta’s marriage ended in divorce in Florida in 1957.\n\nStewart’s father, William D. Mallon, died in September 1958.\n\nIn 1974, a 50-year-old man named Stuart Mallon reported that he had been attacked and robbed in Santa Cruz, California.\n\nStuart died in Santa Cruz on November 11, 1984.\n\nChristie Fletcher: Later Life.\n\nIn 1947, in Victoria, Australia, Christie married Betty Adele Hartley.\n\nIn 1977, Christie and Betty were living in Surfers Paradise in Queensland, Australia.\n\nBetty died on January 12, 1986.\n\nChristie died on December 31, 1992.\n\nChristie William Fletcher and Marcelle Stella Le Claire had a son, Christie Conway Fletcher, who was born about 1938.\n\nIn October 1948, he travelled to Australia on Pan American Airways.\n\nHis destination was 587 Willoughby Road in Willoughby, New South Wales.

He had devoted his working life to Berger Paints, in Britain and India.\n\nStafford was born in White Hart Lane, Tottenham, then largely rural. A lifelong Tottenham Hotspur fan, he recalled that when gas was installed in the family home, the fitter was Tommy Clay, then Spurs captain and an England international.\n\nStafford’s father died in 1919 and he and his brother supported their invalid mother until her death in the 1950s. Stafford joined the National Benzole Company, at 17, qualifying as a chartered secretary in the early 1930s.\n\nIn 1938 he married Lucy Fletcher, and during that decade he also learned to fly. During the second world war he flew briefly with the RAF, and had a “good” war – playing a lot of sport.\n\nHe worked for Berger in Calcutta from the mid-1940s. While there he served as president of the Chartered Secretaries of India. From 1963 until the mid-1970s he worked for Berger in London.\n\nIn 1998 he moved to Manchester to be near his daughter and became involved with the local Liberal Democrats. He cut a distinguished figure on the streets of Chorlton-cum-Hardy in his trademark trilby hat.\n\nHis wife’s death in 1967 was a great blow. He is survived by his son and daughter, four grandchildren and a great-grandson.”\n\nBerger Paints, Wikipedia article; https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Berger_Paints.\n\nStafford Drake Challis (son of Lucy Evelyn Fletcher)\n\n“England and Wales Birth Registration Index, 1837-2008,” database, FamilySearch (https://familysearch.org/ark:/61903/1:1:QVQG-YHJ5 : 1 October 2014), Stafford D Challis, 1942; from “England & Wales Births, 1837-2006,” database, findmypast (http://www.findmypast.com : 2012); citing Birth Registration, Hammersmith, London, England, citing General Register Office, Southport, England.\n\n“England and Wales Marriage Registration Index, 1837-2005,” database, FamilySearch (https://familysearch.org/ark:/61903/1:1:QV67-FSDV : 8 October 2014), Stafford D Challis and null, 1964; from “England & Wales Marriages, 1837-2005,” database, findmypast (http://www.findmypast.com : 2012); citing 1964, quarter 1, vol. 5B, p. 1341, Maidstone, Kent, England, General Register Office, Southport, England.\n\nRuth C.
