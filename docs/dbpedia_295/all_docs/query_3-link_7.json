However, this recent controversy took place in a vacuum of history, in effect, repeating it.\n\nThe early 20th century controversy over the introduction of Ethyl brand leaded gasoline was not well known. Historians have seen it as an example of partisan science (Pleeth, 1949); an example of the heroic nature of invention (Boyd, 1957; Young, 1960; Hughes, 1979; Robert, 1983; Allen, 1996); as the “Three Mile Island” of the 1920s (Pratt, 1980); an example of the contingent nature of technological choices (Bernton, 1981); as a way for GM to compete with Ford (Loeb, 1995); and a case of industry hegemony over science (Rosner & Markowitz, 1989). In recent years, the release of some previously private files has led to re-evaluation of the discovery of leaded gasoline in light of alternatives. (Kovarik, 1993, Kitman, 2000).\n\nThis paper summarizes some of the re-examination of Ethyl leaded gasoline in the context of the technological roads not taken, particularly ethyl alcohol and the close competition between the two Ethyls as anti-knock fuels in the 1920s and 1930s.\n\nThis paper concludes that Ethyl alcohol fuel and Ethyl leaded gasoline are not simply “substitutes” for each other. In the 1919-1923 period, researchers believed that ethyl alcohol would be the fuel of the future when oil ran out. Their original secret motive for creating leaded gasoline was to standardize a high compression gasoline engine that would more efficiently use ethyl alcohol in an oil-short future. Even so, when the environmental crisis came to a head in 1925, GM researchers claimed in government hearings that there were no alternatives to leaded gasoline.\n\nA longstanding policy question of great importance has been whether technology is best shaped by private or by public interests. We are inundated with reasons to deregulate technology today, but the Ethyl conflict provides a cautionary tale about what happens when there is a vacuum of regulation.\n\nThe 21st century historical controversy involves interesting problems of interpretation and documentation as well. The Kovarik and Kitman re-evaluations of the Ethyl conflict have been seen as a ” distorted interpretation of known historic events and documents that have long been in the public record” by industries that developed leaded gasoline. Yet nearly all original primary documents concerning TEL have long been kept out of the public record, with the exception of the small amount of Midgley material released in 1991. In 2002, when tens of thousands of primary documents were provided under legal discovery procedures for a product liability lawsuit (Smith v. Lead Industries), they were sealed at the industry’s request.\n\nOutline of the Ethyl Conflict\n\nThe Ethyl conflict involves several stages of historical competition between two “Ethyls”:\n\n1) Ethyl alcohol (ethanol) made from farm crops or cellulose, which can be blended with gasoline to boost octane (anti-knock) ratings; and\n\n2) “Ethyl” brand leaded gasoline, a higher octane gasoline sold between 1923 and 1986, now banned in most nations for public health reasons.\n\nConsidering engine performance only, there is little difference between the two additives. Three grams of TEL has about the same effect on anti-knock as adding a pint and a half of ethanol to a gallon of gasoline (15-20%), all other things being equal. (Gray/USDA, 1933; Thomas, 2001).\n\nEthyl alcohol is best known as a beverage, of course, but it has also been used as a fuel from the dawn of time. In a blend with turpentine known as “camphene” it was a popular lamp fuel in the first half of the 19th century. It was the fuel used in early automotive experiments by Samuel Morey, Nicholas Otto, Henry Ford and others. Ford championed the view that ethanol was the fuel of the future that would ease the farm crisis by creating new markets for farm products. Ethyl alcohol was blended with various fuels, including gasoline, to boost fuel anti-knock (later known as octane) well before tetra-ethyl lead was introduced. Because it has a naturally high anti-knock rating and can be used in blends or alone as a fuel in standard internal combustion engines, it was considered in the 1920s by many experts – Henry Ford, Alexander Graham Bell, and Charles Kettering among them – to be the fuel of the future.\n\nIn recent years ethyl alcohol blends in gasoline have been called “gasohol” or “ethanol enhanced” gasoline. Most recently, ethanol has replaced MTBE (methyl tertiary butyl alcohol) as an octane booster, especially in areas like California where MTBE is blamed for contaminating water supplies.\n\nEthyl leaded gasoline is the confusing brand name choice for tetra ethyl lead (TEL), which was an anti-knock (octane boosting) gasoline additive discovered by General Motors researchers on Dec. 9, 1921 and introduced commercially in Ohio on Feb. 2,1923. Ethyl is also the corporate name of the joint GM-Standard Oil of New Jersey (Exxon) venture established in 1924 to market the additive. Since GM was 38 percent owned by the E. I. Du Pont de Nemours at the time, there were initially three partners.\n\nThe general public first learned of TEL in late October,1924 when half a dozen workers went violently insane and then died, apparently from a mysterious poison they were making at a Standard oil refinery in New Jersey. When it became clear that this poison was being put into gasoline, and that other workers had died in similar refineries, a vehement public health controversy broke out. GM and Standard insisted that TEL was only dangerous in concentrated form at the refinery, not when diluted in gasoline. But public health scientists, especially Drs. Alice Hamilton of Harvard and Yandell Henderson of Yale, said it was an important public health question and insisted that safer alternatives should be used (as we will see below).\n\nThe PHS appointed an expert committee to investigate health impacts of leaded gasoline, but they did not investigate alternatives despite reports of their widespread use. Health investigations did find what were probably high blood levels of lead, such as blood cell stippling, among garage mechanics and gasoline station attendants. However, the symptoms were not advanced, and government at the time was not strong enough, to ban leaded gasoline.\n\nIn January 1926, the expert committee issued a report stating that there were “no good grounds for prohibiting the use of Ethyl gasoline,”provided that its own investigation was not allowed to lapse. In fact, no independent investigations were continued, although Ethyl financed decades of research through the University of Cincinnati.\n\nIn 1962, GM arranged a leveraged buyout of Ethyl by a Virginia paper company so that the company was independent and no longer a partnership with Standard Oil of N.J. (Exxon). In 1965 and 1966, scholarship and Congressional testimony, especially from Clair Patterson, a California Institute of Technology geochemist, showed that Ethyl’s Cincinnati research was based on questionable and probably fabricated data. (Patterson, 1965, Rosner & Markowitz, 1989)\n\nIn 1970, GM announced its intention to build cars that would use unleaded gasoline. In 1972 that the Environmental Protection Agency began a regulatory process that phased out leaded gasoline. The decision was primarily based on the need for catalytic converters to reduce other pollutants such as carbon monoxide and nitrogen oxides. Leaded gasoline had to be phased out since catalytic converters are contaminated by lead. Yet public health concerns were also seriously considered. Many studies, especially early studies by Herbert Needleman and associates, found children highly affected by leaded gasoline.\n\nThe phase out process took until 1986 in the US, another 15 years in Europe and is still underway in most developing nations. Indonesia, one of the last, won’t phase out leaded gasoline until 2005.\n\nToday, over 50 to 70 percent of children living in the inner cities like New Orleans and Philadelphia have blood lead levels above the current guideline of 10 micrograms per deciliter. The toxic effects of lead include damage to the nervous system, learning impairments and behavioral problems. High lead levels in many urban areas are from leaded gasoline more than lead paint. (Mielke, 1999).\n\nConcerns about damage from widespread lead poisoning turned out to have been justified, as Henderson, Hamilton and others foresaw in 1925. The story of their public health advocacy, especially with its emphasis on alternative technologies, deserves to be remembered.\n\nEthyl alcohol for spirit lamps\n\nUse of ethyl alcohol as a fuel is ancient, but its widespread use for indoor lighting began in the early 19th century with spirit lamps that were improvements to candles and lanterns.\n\nThe historical myth has it that kerosene arrived just in time to replace dwindling supplies of whale oil. In fact, 19th century illuminants included a wide variety of fuels: vegetable oils (castor, rapeseed, peanut); animal oils (especially whale oil and tallow from beef or pork,); refined turpentine from pine trees; and alcohols, especially wood alcohol (methanol or methyl alcohol) and grain alcohol (ethanol or ethyl alcohol). By far the most popular fuel in the U.S. before petroleum was a blend of alcohol and turpentine called “camphene” or simply “burning fluid.” Around 1860, thousands of distilleries churned out at least 90 million gallons of alcohol per year for lighting. Camphene (at $.50 per gallon) was cheaper than whale oil ($1.30 to $2.50 per gallon) and lard oil (90 cents per gallon). It was about the same price as coal oil, which was the product first marketed as “kerosene” (literally “sun fuel”).\n\nKerosene from petroleum was a useful fuel when it arrived in the 1860s: it was usually not too volatile, it burned brightly and it was fairly cheap. A gradual shift from camphene to kerosene might have occurred. Instead, a $2.08 per gallon tax on alcohol was imposed in stages between 1862 and 1864 as part of the Internal Revenue Act to pay for the Civil War. The tax was meant to apply to beverage alcohol, but without any specific exemption, it was also applied to fuel and industrial uses for alcohol. “The imposition of the internal-revenue tax on distilled spirits … increased the cost of this ‘burning fluid’ beyond the possibility of using it in competition with kerosene..,” said Rufus F. Herrick, an engineer with the Edison Electric Testing Laboratory who wrote one of the first books on the use of alcohol fuel in 1907.\n\nWhile a gradual shift from burning fluid (or spirit lamps) to kerosene did occur in Europe during the last half of the 19th century, the American alcohol tax meant that kerosene became the primary fuel virtually overnight, and the distilleries making lamp fuel lost their markets. The tax “had the effect of upsetting [the distilleries] and in some cases destroying them,” said IRS commissioner David A. Wells in 1872. 1\n\nBy 1906, a movement to repeal the tax on non-beverage industrial uses was hailed as a new market for American farmers. Earlier popular attempts to repeal the tax had failed on technicalities, but the farm lobby found an ally in President Theodore Roosevelt, a bitter foe of the oil industry. Roosevelt said an industrial alcohol industry provided a possible check to the depredations of the oil trust. In April, 1906, a bill to repeal the alcohol sales tax sailed through the House on a 224 to 7 vote with widespread support from farm-belt representatives.\n\nAdditional support came from the Temperance Party, which saw in alcohol fuel a beneficial use for a pernicious commodity. The president of the Automobile Club of America also supported the bill, saying: “Gasoline is growing scarcer, and therefore dearer, all the time… Automobiles cannot use gasoline for all time, of that I am sure, and alcohol seems to be the best substitute that has yet appeared.” (US House and Senate hearings on the “Free Alcohol” bill, 1906).\n\nEthyl alcohol in the early 20th century\n\nThe idea of replacing the external combustion steam engine with an internal combustion liquid fuel engine seized the world’s imagination in the late 19th century, but the origins of internal combustion engines can be traced back two centuries beforehand. Historian Lyle Cummins has noted that at least a dozen inventors tried to develop some form of internal combustion engine by the early 19th century. The first authentic internal combustion engine in America was developed by Samuel Morey at the surprisingly early date of 1826. It ran on ethyl alcohol and turpentine (camphene) and powered an experimental wagon and a small boat at eight miles per hour up the Connecticut river. (Cummins, 1989).\n\nNicholas Otto’s early prototype of the internal combustion engine used ethyl alcohol as a fuel because it was widely used for spirit lamps throughout Europe. He devised a carburetor which, like Morey’s, heated the alcohol to help it vaporize as the engine was being started. It is interesting to note that Otto’s initial financing came from Eugen Langen, who owned a a sugar refining company that probably had links to the alcohol markets of Europe. Of course, the Otto & Langen company went on to success in the 1870s by producing stationary gas engines (usually powered by coal gas) and the later “Otto-cycle” engine was fueled primarily with gasoline but was still adaptable to alcohol or benzene from coal. Numerous other engine prototypes were developed using alcohol or turpentine, including the 1870s external combustion engine developed by US inventor George Brayton. However, at the dawn of the automotive age, kerosene was widely available and gasoline, although volatile and dangerous for lamps, was cheap and very much in surplus as a byproduct of kerosene refining.\n\nDuring the 1890 – 1914 time period, German, French and British scientists and government officials were worried about the longevity of oil reserves and the unpredictable nature of oil supplies from Russia and America. “The oil trust battles between Rockefeller, the Rothschilds, the Nobels and Marcus Samuel’s Shell kept prices in a state of flux, and engines often had to be adaptable to the fuel that was available,” said Cummins. Manufacturing companies in Germany, England and France sold engines equipped to handle a variety of fuels. In tropical nations where oil supplies were quite irregular, and in closed environments such as mines and factories, alcohol engines were often preferred.\n\nWith few domestic oil reserves, France and Germany especially were eager to encourage widespread development of a fuel that could be readily distilled from domestic farm products. Research at the Experimental Mechanical Laboratory of Paris and at the Deutsche Landwirtschaftliche Gesellschaft in Berlin in the 1890s helped pave the way for expanded use of alcohol fuel. (Brachvogel, 1907). The question of whether gasoline or alcohol was the better fuel often provoked spirited debate, and numerous races between cars with different fuels were held in Europe.\n\nScientific journals contain hundreds of references to alcohol fuel at the dawn of the automotive era. 2 Research during the earliest decades tended to focus on pure alcohol as a replacement for petroleum. The focus shifted to the anti-knock (“octane” boosting) properties of alcohol blends in gasoline during the 1915 to 1936 period because of an increasing need for anti-knock gasoline and because of improvements in alcohol production techniques.\n\nStudies of alcohol as an internal combustion engine fuel began in the U.S. with the Edison Electric Testing Laboratory and Columbia University in 1906. Elihu Thomson reported that despite a smaller heat or B.T.U. value, “a gallon of alcohol will develop substantially the same power in an internal combustion engine as a gallon of gasoline. This is owing to the superior efficiency of operation…” (New York Times Aug. 5, 1906) Other researchers confirmed the same phenomena around the same time.\n\nUSDA tests in 1906 also demonstrated the efficiency of alcohol in engines and described how gasoline engines could be modified for higher power with pure alcohol fuel or for equivalent fuel consumption, depending on the need. The U.S. Geological Service and the U.S. Navy performed 2000 tests on alcohol and gasoline engines in 1907 and 1908 in Norfolk, Va. and St. Louis, Mo. They found that much higher engine compression ratios could be achieved with alcohol than with gasoline. When the compression ratios were adjusted for each fuel, fuel economy was virtually equal despite the greater B.T.U. value of gasoline. “In regard to general cleanliness, such as absence of smoke and disagreeable odors, alcohol has many advantages over gasoline or kerosene as a fuel,” the report said. “The exhaust from an alcohol engine is never clouded with a black or grayish smoke.” USGS continued the comparative tests and later noted that alcohol was “a more ideal fuel than gasoline” with better efficiency despite the high cost.\n\nEthyl Alcohol Fuel Research around World War I\n\nThe French War Office tested gasoline, benzene and an alcohol-benzene blend in road tests in 1909, and the results showed that benzene gave higher mileage than gasoline or the alcohol blend in existing French trucks. The British Fuel Research Board also tested alcohol and benzene mixtures around the turn of the century and just before World War I, finding that alcohol blends had better thermal efficiency than gasoline but that engines developed less brake horsepower at low rpm. On the other hand, a British researcher named Watson found that thermal efficiencies for alcohol, benzene and gasoline were very nearly equal. (Monier-Williams, 1922).\n\nDuring and after the war, the British Fuel Research Board actively researched military and civilian fuels and in1918 said that alcohol and coal based fuels could replace oil in the post-war period. Especially notable was the work of Eugene Ormandy and H.R. Ricardo. Ormandy noted the absence of technical problems with alcohol blends, but concluded that “alcohol cannot compete with gasoline at present prices.” Harold B. Dixon, working for the board and other governmental departments, reported in 1920 that higher possible engine compression compensated for alcohol’s low caloric value. A mixture of alcohol with 20 percent benzene or gasoline “runs very smoothly, and without knocking.” Also, B.R. Tunnison reported in 1920 the anti-knock effects of alcohol blends in gasoline and said mileage was improved. Ormandy also noted that only five percent of the American grain crop would meet requirements for a blended fuel. (Ormandy, 1919).\n\nAnother significant set of British experiments was performed by the London General Omnibus Co. in 1919 comparing gasoline with blends of ethyl alcohol and benzene. Mileage was about the same, with gasoline slightly ahead. “In all other respects the [alcohol] fuel compared favorably with petrol [gasoline], and exhibited the characteristics of other alcohol mixtures in respect of flexibility, absence of knocking and cleanliness.” The bus experiment also showed that a large scale switch from petroleum was technically feasible. “We are fast squandering the oil that has been stored in the fuel beds, and it seems so far as our present knowledge takes us that it is to the fuels experimented with that we must turn for our salvation,” said the omnibus company engineer in the SAE Journal. (Shave,1920)\n\nH.R. Ricardo’s work focused in part on testing fuels at various compression ratios up to the point where they would begin knocking, or what he termed the “highest useful compression ratio.” Ethyl alcohol had a 7.5 value, with commercial gasolines then available at 4.5 to 6. Ricardo also developed the Toluene Index, which like Thomas Midgley’s “iso-octane” measured anti-knock with a reference fuel. Ricardo concluded that the low burning rate of alcohol lessened the tendency to knock, and that, using toluene as the reference point at 100 anti-knock, alcohol had a 130 rating. (Ricardo, 1921). According to historian Stuart Leslie, Ricardo found that “ethyl alcohol never knocked, it could be produced by distilling waste vegetable material, and it was almost pollution-free. Ricardo compared alcohol fuel to living within a man’s means, implying that fossil fuels were a foolish squandering of capital.” [i]\n\nSeveral difficulties with alcohol fuels were known: cold starting, was one, and E.C. Freeland noted that blends of small amounts of ether in alcohol could solve the problem.(Friedland, 1925) Another problem was “phase separation,” noted above. But the tendency of alcohol and gasoline to separate at lower temperatures in the presence of water could be easily overcome with “binders,” and was noted by Thomas Midgley, among others. These were small amounts of additives such as higher-carbon alcohols (such as propyl or butyl alcohol), ethers and / or benzene. Operating practice was also important tin dealing with alcohol fuels. Fuel distributors were cautioned to use anhydrous (low water content) alcohol and avoided storing alcohol-gasoline blends in tanks with water “bottoms.” Swedish researcher E. Hubendick said that the danger of separation “can be ignored in my estimation” because even if it did occur, it would never stop the motor in the way that a small amount of water in the gas tank would. (Hixon, 1933).\n\nScientific Conclusions About Ethyl Alcohol\n\nThese experiments and ideas are representative of a great deal of work underway before and after World War I. The scientific conclusions were so definitive that even a 1915 boys’ book entitled Modern Inventions had a chapter entitled “Alcohol Motors and the Fuel of the Future” located amid the zeppelins and submarines. (Johnson, 1915). Higher compression was listed as among ethyl alcohol’s advantages.\n\nScientific American summed up the research in many articles during this period. Several representative articles are cited here:\n\n• … the fuel problem is rapidly getting more serious. Alcohol has often been suggested, but it is not altogether satisfactory, and the supply is not great enough to allow it to take the place of gasoline… It has been found that a mixture of 25 percent each of gasoline and benzole with 50 percent of alcohol works very satisfactorily in our present motors, and as these proportions correspond fairly well with the output of various ingredients that may be anticipated, this may prove to be the solution of the fuel problem..” (April 13, 1918, p. 339).\n\n“It is now definitely established that alcohol can be blended with gasoline to produce a suitable motor fuel that will avoid the difficulties of starting a cold motor on alcohol alone and without any change in the carburetor or the compression of the engine… The production of industrial alcohol on a large scale would accordingly help materially to increase the supply of fuel … Distilleries and breweries whose business is being curtailed by passage of ‘dry’ laws in different states … should welcome an opportunity to continue operation.” (July 6, 1918).\n\n“Increasing prices of the liquid fuels required by the motor industry led the author to examine the patent specifications bearing on this subject from 1913 onward … The specifications bear evidence of the universal assumption that [ethyl] alcohol in some form will be a constituent of the motor fuel of the future… Every chemist knows [alcohol and gasoline] will mix, and every engineer knows [they] will drive an internal combustion engine.” (Dec. 11, p.593)\n\nIn short, technical research into ethyl alcohol as a fuel tended to be extremely positive, with few if any negative findings. By 1925, an American researcher speaking at the New York Chemists Club said:\n\n“Composite fuels made simply by blending anhydrous alcohol with gasoline have been given most comprehensive service tests extending over a period of eight years. Hundreds of thousands of miles have been covered in standard motor car, tractor, motor boat and aeroplane engines with highly satisfactory results… Alcohol blends easily excel gasoline on every point important to the motorist. The superiority of alcohol gasoline fuels is now safely established by actual experience… [Thus] the future of alcohol motor fuels is largely an economic problem. (Whitaker, 1925)\n\n“The burden falls upon the engine, It must adapt itself to less volatile fuel, and it must be made to burn the fuel with less waste…. Automotive engineers must turn their thoughts away from questions of speed and weight… and comfort and endurance” and focus on “averting the calamity.”\n\nAugust 15, 1925\n\nALCOHOL FOR MOTOR FUEL\n\nFurther to my letter of June 19th:\n\nYou may probably have observed the production of synthetic alcohol as brought out by the Badische Anilin and Soda Fabrik [BASF of I.G. Farben], now being produced in Germany at the rate of 60,000 gallons per month. Such alcohol is reported to be produced for between 10 cents and 20 cents per gallon and has much promise as a mixture with hydrocarbon fuels to eliminate knocking and carbonization.\n\n(signed) Wm. H. Smith, Ford Motor Co.\n\nThe letter, clearly, is a fragment of more extensive correspondence that was not saved in the Public Health Service or Winslow files. Winslow’s recommendation about continuing the search was not incorporated in the final committee report. Although disappointed in the report, Winslow wrote Henderson, who was in England in the winter of 1925, that he “did not see how things could have gone differently.”\n\nHigh anti-knock values may be and are also obtained by the addition to gasoline of benzol and alcohol, but insufficient quantities of the former are available to permit its use in any large amount of gasoline … while\n\nthe use of alcohol is relatively new in the United States, though it has been used extensively abroad for many years.[vi]\n\n“When a certain point in costs has been reached, several methods of meeting the situation will be available: These include: increased importation\n\nof petroleum; more complete recovery of domestic petroleum from the ground by various so-called secondary methods; conversion of natural gas into gasoline; extraction of oil from shale; synthesis of oil from coal; domestic production of alcohol from vegetable materials; and foreign production of such alcohol.”"
