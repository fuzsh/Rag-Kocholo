        "text": "15.1 miles of National Cycle Route 5 – almost constantly, closely cuddling the coast.\n\nFrank Patterson\n\nPrestatyn\n\nThere is evidence that the current town location has been occupied since prehistoric times. Prehistoric tools found in the caves of Graig Fawr, in the nearby village of Meliden, have revealed the existence of early human habitation in the area.\n\n“Sunny Prestatyn” became famous for its beach, clean seas and promenade entertainers, and visiting for a bathe was considered very healthy by city-dwelling Victorians.\n\nThe town is at the northern end of the Offa’s Dyke Path, although not on Offa’s Dyke itself.\n\nThe holiday camp in Prestatyn was built by the London Midland and Scottish Railway Co. in 1939. The main buildings were in classic 1930s style, featuring rounded building ends, steel framed windows and porthole windows. Chalets showed an early form of sectionalised building method.\n\nRequisitioned as a military camp until after the Second World War, it reopened as a holiday camp in the early 1950s. The site was demolished and cleared between February and March 2001.\n\nCoflein\n\nThe camp was sold in 1975 and taken over by Pontins, but it closed in 1985.\n\nAfter that, it was used by the police for riot control training.\n\nIn 1973 the camp took a starring role in the comedy movie Holiday on the Buses.\n\nThe refurbished Pontin’s now trades as Prestatyn Sands.\n\nPrestatyn offers the opportunity to engage in an impromptu game of Crazy Golf – though the facility was closed on the morning of my visit.\n\nThe crazy golf was fantastic the kids didn’t want to leave plus the lady was so helpful plus the price were very reasonable – would highly recommended.\n\nThe promenade is dominated by a tight knit group of modern leisure facilities.\n\nAn expansive car park fronts directly onto the seafront.\n\nThere have been serious reinforcements made to the seawalls – ensuring that the passing cyclist will not be washed away, by the crashing waves of the incoming tide.\n\nThe reinforcement work demands that we temporarily detour onto the Rhyl Coast Road, where we encounter Pirate Island Adventure Golf.\n\nUncover hidden treasure on the North Welsh Coast at Pirate Island Adventure Golf at Lyons Robin Hood Holiday Park.\n\nMake friends with the great white shark, octopus, and the resident pirates who guard the Island.\n\nThis 18-hole course is a fun and crazy challenge for all the family, with stunning views of Rhyl seafront to boot. Plus, it’s located just a stone’s throw away from Sherwoods Sports Bar where refreshments are served.\n\nRhyl\n\nRhyl Sands: David Cox 1854\n\nThe Welsh orthography has proved difficult for English writers to transliterate as Rhyl’s opening voiceless alveolar trill is uncommon in the English language.\n\nI nipped into town for a tub from Sidoli’s – £1.83 well spent.\n\nThe promenade is home to a series of entertainments including the Rhyl Pavilion Theatre\n\nThe theatre, owned and operated by Denbighshire Council, has also been re-clad as part of the project, designed by architects Space & Place.\n\nIt forms part of a wider redevelopment of Rhyl’s seafront, which includes the demolition of the Sun Centre and the construction of a £15m water park.\n\nPlace North West 2019\n\nThere is a also a becalmed Post Modernist Piazza – named Rhyl Events Arena.\n\nThe playful nursery geometry of the SeaQuarium.\n\nThe functionalist Vue Cinema.\n\nTickets were £5.99 for a standard seat, the staff said not to bother upgrading as the premium seats were rubbish, sound was okay and picture quality was okay.\n\nFood price was expensive so it maybe cheap to get in, but £16.99 for a large popcorn and drink ups the price, would go again if in the area.\n\nJoanne H – Bingley UK\n\nThe slightly off-brown behemoth SC2 designed by architect Space & Place.\n\nThe former Sun Centre having been demolished.\n\nThe outdoor play area has a distinctive Ettore Sottsass theme.\n\nCrossing the harbour by way of the brand new Pont y Ddraig Bridge opened in October 2013.\n\nThe bridge was designed by Gifford – now part of Ramboll and built by Dawnus, fabrication of the two bascule decks was by AM Structures.\n\nHappy Pontist\n\nMuch of the coast is fringed with chalets and static caravans.\n\nKinmel Bay\n\nHome to The Frothy Coffee.\n\nThere aren’t enough food, service, value or atmosphere ratings for The Frothy Coffee, yet – be one of the first to write a review!\n\nKinmel Bay beach is popular with tourists and the local population. In addition to various small shops and takeaway outlets, there is also an Asda superstore that opened in 1981, which includes a large petrol filling station.\n\nWikipedia\n\nThe concrete shore is softened by grasses and wild flowers – with views of the mountains beyond.\n\nHere we are in Towyn\n\nThe town made national headlines in 1990 when a combination of gale-force winds, a high tide and rough seas caused Towyn’s flood defences to be breached at about 11.00am on 26 February. Four square miles of land was flooded, affecting 2,800 properties and causing areas of the resort to be evacuated. Further flooding occurred later the same week, on 1 March, shortly after the site of the disaster was visited by Prince Charles and Princess Diana.\n\nScientific experts also believe that the silt left behind from the flooding had left the town with a higher concentration of radioactivity, over ten times the governmental safety limits, most likely originating from the nuclear processing plant at Sellafield which had been dispersed into the Irish Sea over many years since its construction.\n\nWikipedia\n\nExcitements galore, await at the well maintained funfair.\n\nMotor cars to the fore, as the intrepid sea-anglers prepare for a day of sea-angling.\n\nAbergele where Family Fun can be found in the form of Kiddies Karts.\n\nIn 2020/21 Abergele hosted the 20th and 21st editions of I’m a Celebrity Get Me Out of Here! at Gwrych Castle, due to the Covid pandemic restrictions in Australia.\n\nI failed to avail myself with a chilly treat courtesy of Danny’s Whippy, having already had my 99 tub, from Sidoli’s in Rhyl.\n\nLocal brewery Purple Moose’s delivery van driver takes a timely break, whilst fellow cyclists stop for a cig and a chat.\n\nRugged rocks, sadly lacking ragged rascals, as the Little Orme comes into view.\n\nCast concrete defences, and Raynes Quarry jetty at Llandulas.\n\nThe quarry was originally known as Llysfaen Limeworks, being close to Llysfaen railway station. James Trevelyan Raynes of Rock Ferry, Birkenhead, took over the quarry in the 1870s, adding large new limekilns. Lime from the quarry was shipped to various alkali works. Alkali was used for soap, textiles and many other goods.\n\nQuarrying in this area has also produced porcelain-like limestone for high quality architectural uses. St Margaret’s Church – also known as the Marble Church in Bodelwyddan, was built with limestone from Llanddulas.\n\nIn November 2011 one of the freighters, MV Swanland, sank in stormy weather on the Irish Sea after collecting 3,000 tons of stone from Raynes jetty bound for the Isle of Wight.\n\nTwo crewmen were rescued but five, all Russian, were lost.\n\nHistory Points\n\nAlmost the end of the line here in Old Colwyn – where there are the last of a series of shelters.\n\nFormerly lining the prom all the way to Rhos on Sea\n\nCutting under the A55 Expressway to Colwyn Bay.\n\nDuring World War II the Colwyn Bay Hotel, Marine Road – now demolished, was the headquarters of the Ministry of Food. This also housed the Cocoa & Chocolate division and was the communications hub for the ministry, they continued to use the hotel until 1953.\n\nWikipedia\n\nJust in time for the 4.00 opening of Black Cloak Brewery & Taproom.\n\nA fine and fitting end to a sunny day cycling along the North Wales Coastal Cycle Route.\n\nTime for the train home to Stockport – but you can bet I’ll be back.\n\nWe awoke, we dawdled around Deal, prior to our delightful breakfast.\n\nThough the pier appeared to be closed.\n\nExtending elegantly over a still, still sea.\n\nThe present pier, designed by Sir W. Halcrow & Partners, was opened on 19 November 1957 by the Duke of Edinburgh. Constructed predominantly from concrete-clad steel, it is 1,026 ft in length – a notice announces that it is the same length as the RMS Titanic, but that ship was just 882 feet, and ends in a three-tiered pier-head, featuring a cafe, bar, lounge, and fishing decks.\n\nThe lowest of the three tiers is underwater at all but the lowest part of the tidal range, and has become disused.\n\nWikipedia\n\nDeal is home to some of the most extraordinary concrete shelters.\n\nHome to some understated Seaside Moderne homes too.\n\nWell fed, we set out along the private road that edges the golf course, encountering some informal agricultural architecture.\n\nWe took time to explore Pegwell Bay Hoverport – currently trading as a Country Park.\n\nPausing in Ramsgate to admire Edward Welby Pugin’s Grade II Listed – Granville Hotel.\n\nThe Granville development, so named after George Leverson Gower, second Earl Granville (1815-1891), was a venture undertaken by Edward Welby Pugin, together with investors Robert Sankey, George Burgess and John Barnet Hodgson on land acquired from the Mount Albion Estate in 1867. The scheme was to be an important new building in the eastward expansion of the town and the emergence of a fashionable new suburb. At the outset, the intention was to build a relatively restrained speculative terrace of large townhouses with some additional facilities. However, as the scheme progressed and it became apparent that buyers could not be secured, revised plans for an enlarged hotel complex were adopted in 1868 and brought to completion in 1869. These plans, which added a series of grand rooms including a banqueting hall, receptions rooms and an entrance hall in addition to a tunnel to connect to the railway line on the seafront, gardens, a complex of Turkish baths and a vast landmark tower (originally 170ft high, although truncated at a relatively early date), were remarkably ambitious. Ultimately, as it would transpire, the scheme was rather too ambitious on Pugin’s part; with his increasing reliance on loans eventually culminating in bankruptcy in October 1872, an event which precipitated his demise as an architect, tragically followed by his death just three years later.\n\nHistoric England\n\nOverlooking the sea, the ornamental gardens were laid out and presented to the Borough of Ramsgate by Dame Janet Stancomb-Wills in 1920 and opened to the public in June 1923 by the Mayor of Ramsgate Alderman A. W. Larkin. They are maintained by Thanet District Council and were Grade II listed on 4 February 1988.\n\nThe gardens were designed by the architects Sir John Burnet & Partners, and constructed by Pulham and Son. The main feature of the gardens, is a semi-circular shaped colonnade carved into the pulhamite recess.\n\nOn the upper terrace, approached by broad flights of steps, the gardens proper are reached. In the centre, and immediately over the shelter, is a circular pool enclosed on the north side by a semi-circular Roman seat.\n\nWikipedia\n\nBroadstairs was alive with Bank Holiday activity.\n\nOn leaving the town we encounter this engaging flint church – Holy Trinity\n\nErected 1829-1830. David Barnes Architect, extended 1925.\n\nBuilt of flint and rubble.\n\nOne of the first visitors to this church was Charles Dickens who offered a very unflattering description in his work, Our English Watering Place:\n\nWe have a church, by the bye, of course – a hideous temple of flint, like a petrified haystack. Our chief clerical dignitary, who, to his honour, has done much for education, and has established excellent schools, is a sound, healthy gentleman, who has got into little local difficulties with the neighbouring farms, but has the pestilent trick of being right.\n\nIn Margate the tidal pools are full of waveless sea water and kiddy fun.\n\nThe former crazy golf course is undergoing an ongoing programme of involuntary rewilding.\n\nThe Turner Contemporary was hosting an impromptu al fresco sculpture show.\n\nDreamland was still dreaming.\n\nAnd Arlington House staring steadfastly out to sea.\n\nTime now for tea and a welcome plate of chish and fips at the Beano Cafe.\n\nI miss my haddock and chips from Beano in Margate, brought to you with a smile and he remembers everyone.\n\nGreat customer service and friendly staff, see you soon.\n\nThe food is awful and the customer service is even worse: when we complained about the food the staff argued with us and wouldn’t do anything to change the food or refund, avoid at all costs!\n\nTrip Advisor\n\nTime for a wander around Cliftonville.\n\nDiscovering a shiny new launderette.\n\nAnd a launderette that wasn’t a launderette – it’s a Werkhaus that isn’t a workhouse.\n\nAnd a patriotic tea rooms.\n\nSo farewell then the south coast – we’re off home on the train in the morning.\n\nBut first a pint or two.\n\nMonday 3rd August 2015 one finds oneself wide wake in the Rydeview Hotel.\n\nFaced with a breakfast best described as indescribable.\n\nI arose and departed, not angry but hungry.\n\nMade my way to the corner of Southsea Common, where once we drank – Tim Rushton and I were often to be found in The Wheelbarrow together.\n\nA boozer no longer, now named for the city’s long gone famous son.\n\nHow bad a pub is this? I walk past it to get to my local. Most nights there are six people max in the bar, all huddled around the bar itself, backs to the door. – this often includes the landlord and landlady. They have live music there once in a while and you can’t get served by the one bloke behind the bar – the landlord and landlady never help out, they don’t seem to give a toss.\n\nBeers crap, not worth a visit.\n\nIt was never like that in our day.\n\nVisiting our former abode on Shaftesbury Road – where I once dwelt along with Tim, Catherine, Liz and Trish.\n\nYet more Stymie Bold Italic.\n\nBack to the front for a peer at the pier.\n\nClarence Pier is an amusement pier located next to Southsea Hoverport. Unlike most seaside piers in the UK, the pier does not extend very far out to sea and instead goes along the coast.\n\nThe pier was originally constructed and opened in 1861 by the Prince and Princess of Wales and boasted a regular ferry service to the Isle of Wight. It was damaged by air raids during World War II and was reopened in its current form on 1 June 1961 after being rebuilt by local architects AE Cogswell & Sons and R Lewis Reynish.\n\nLow cloud grey skies and drizzle.\n\nThis sizeable two bedroom apartment situated on the seventh floor of the ever popular Fastnet House is offered with no onward chain and the option of a new 999 year lease as well as a share of the freehold. With panoramic views over The Solent towards the Isle Of Wight and Spinnaker Tower, situated in a central location and close to all amenities, this lovely apartment offers luxury living for any prospective buyer. With lift access, the apartment comprises; entrance hallway, a large lounge diner with box bay window boasting stunning sea views across the city and The Solent, master bedroom with built in wardrobes and sea views over The Solent, a spacious second bedroom, fitted kitchen with breakfast bar and a recently updated modern shower room.\n\nOn The Market £365,000\n\nWe are fully stocked with house coal, smokeless coal, kindling and fire lighters, fire grates, companion sets and fire tools.\n\nChristmas lights have also arrived.\n\nBrockenhurst’s traditional hardware shop since 1926\n\nGhost garage.\n\nGhost post.\n\nCoal Exchange – Peter and Dawn welcome you to their traditional pub in the heart of Emsworth adjacent to the public car park in South Street and close to the harbour.\n\nLillywhite Bros Ltd is a family run business established over 60 years ago in Emsworth, which is ideally located between Portsmouth and Chichester. It is currently run by brothers Paul and Mike who continue to keep up with modern techniques and equipment, as well as maintaining their traditional values and high standard of customer service.\n\nNext thing you know I’m in Pagham, having become very lost somewhere between there and here, asking for directions from the newsagents and buying a bottle of Oasis.\n\nThe newsagent was mildly amused by lack of map, sense and/or sensibility.\n\nI spent many happy hours here in my youth playing the slots with The King.\n\nWe would stay here in Tamarisk with my Aunty Alice and Uncle Arthur and Smudge the cat, an idyllic railway carriage shack two rows back from the pebbled seashore.\n\nWe would enjoy a shandy at the King’s Beach with Lydia, Wendy and David.\n\nAll gone it seems.\n\nOn to Bognor a B&B and a brew – a brief glimpse into my luxury lifestyle.\n\nI’ll take an overcast Monday evening stroll along the prom, where I chanced to meet two landlocked Chinese lads, gazing amazed at the sea – they were on a course in Chichester learning our own particular, peculiar ways.\n\nThere was no-one else around.\n\nWho can resit the obvious allure of the novelty item?\n\nOr an Art Deco garage fascia.\n\nFitzleet House was built in the 1960s architects: Donald Harwin & Partners, it consists of seventy four flats, fifteen of them are in a three-storey block next to the main building.\n\nPS&B are pleased to offer this sixth floor flat which is situated conveniently close to the town centre and within close proximity of the sea front. The accommodation is newly refurnbished and is offered unfurnished with south/west facing lounge with small balcony with far reaching views to the sea. Kitchen and bathroom with shower over bath and one double bedroom. Further benefiting from having modern electric heating and double glazing, telephone entry system, lift to all floors, communal sky dish and white goods. With regret no pets and no children – £685 rental is payable calendar monthly in advance.\n\nFor many years, a gentleman called Todd Sweeney collected sunshine statistics from the roof of Fitzleet House, which were then forwarded to the Met Office in London to assist with national statistics, and in 1983 one group of Cubs arranged a special tea party on the roof of the building as part of the national tea-making fortnight.\n\nBognor Regis Post\n\nHighlight of the day or any day for that matter the Health Centre.\n\nPaul English Conservative Felpham East – asked about the life span of the building given it was built in the 1960s, describing it as ‘incredibly old’.\n\nMr Clavell-Bate replied – NHS Property Services say it is structurally sound, it has a life expectancy going forward.\n\nBognor Regis Observer\n\nI was looking forward to going forward Wetherspoon’s – ideologically unsound going forward, with hindsight.\n\nLet’s take a last late night stroll along the promenade.\n\nNight night.\n\nSunday 2nd August 2015 – you awake and you’re still in Bournemouth and still in one piece, the possibility of late night stag and hen madness passed over without incident.\n\nA quick look around town, then let’s get off to Pompey – where I was very proud to be a Polytechnic art student 1973/76, in good old Lion Terrace.\n\nLast night’s late night drinking den with its fabulous faience frontage and doorstep mosaic.\n\nClose by this tiled porch at The Branksome.\n\nBuilt 1932 by Seal and Hardy as offices for the Bournemouth Echo, steel-framed, the main elevations faced in Monks Park Bath Stone.\n\nPlans to redevelop the listed Daily Echo offices in Bournemouth were withdrawn shortly before they were due to be discussed by councillors.\n\nThat Group’s application to extend the Richmond Hill building to create more work space as well as a 30-bed hotel, café, gym and events space had been recommended for refusal before it was pulled from the agenda for Monday’s meeting.\n\nDaily Echo\n\nVandale House appears to have been refurbished as flats, having lost its architectural type.\n\nThe property benefits from modern and contemporary décor throughout, large balcony and views over the Town Centre itself.\n\nThis art deco cinema was built for ABC and designed by their regular architect William Glen, it opened in June 1937.\n\nThe ABC, originally the Westover Super Cinema, entertained audiences for almost 80 years before it was closed in 2017 – along with the nearby Odeon – to make way for a new Odeon multiplex at the BH2 complex.\n\nIn its rejected plans for the site, Libra Homes had pledged to restore the cinema’s original Art Deco frontage, if it survives under the cladding that was added in the 1960s.\n\nCinema Treasures\n\nBoscombe Pier – is the perfect vantage point to watch volleyball, table tennis and mini golf. If you are feeling adventurous, try scaling the nearby, purpose built boulders next to the pier or have a go at slacklining!\n\nThere are nearby are cafés, takeaways and beach shops all within walking distance from Boscombe Pier. The pier is free to enter and has a plethora of activies that individuals and families can enjoy!\n\nDesigned by Archibald Smith, the 600 foot pier opened on 28th July 1889. In 1924/5 and 1927, the head was renewed in high alumina concrete and, between 1958 and 1960, the neck was reconstructed using reinforced concrete.\n\nThe neck building is a design by the Borough Architects, demonstrating great verve and vivacity. The contemporary style associated with Frank Lloyd Wright’s Usonian houses and made popular with Californian homes in the 1940s was well suited to the requirements of an architecture that combined ‘sun and fun’. The contemporary style made a feature of expressing different elements or planes of a composition with different materials, and here the combination is honest and each element well detailed. The sweep of the cantilevered, boomerang-shaped roof is a particularly joyous feature. It is a building that would have been despised as being exactly of its date until recently; now it is a building that can be celebrated for that very reason, and a rare example of pier architecture from these years.\n\nHistoric England Listing\n\nSan Remo Towers a block of 164 flats, with penthouse and office, over basement garage. 1935-8 by Hector O’Hamilton.\n\nFacilities offered as inclusive in this price included centralised hot water and central heating, an auto vac’ cleaning system, centralised telephones, a resident manager, a porter, daily maid, boot cleaning and window cleaning services. There was a Residents’ club with a reading room card room, billiard room and library, and a children’s recreation and games room. There were kiosks in the ground-floor lobbies selling tobacco and convenience items, where the staff took orders for the local tradesmen. The fifth-floor restaurant offered a la carte meals, which could be taken at pension rates of 38s per week. A simpler dinner cost 2/6d. The use of an American architect, Hector O Hamilton, may be an explanation for the building’s large range of facilities, including the grand underground car park and sophisticated servicing\n\nTwo bed flat £183,000\n\nCarlinford benefits from commanding views over Poole Bay looking to the Isle of Wight across to the Purbecks. Included in the annual service charge is a Caretaker, Gardener & the communal areas are kept in good order. A fabulous location and a great place to call home.\n\nTwo bed flat £350,000\n\nCrossing the New Forest and arriving in Hythe.\n\nRunning the length of the pier to catch the ferry across Southampton Water.\n\nWhere one is able to see many large ships.\n\nSt Patrick’s Catholic Church 1939\n\nW.C. Mangan’s last church in the diocese, with a moderne Gothic character rather than the basilican style he favoured elsewhere. The design is not without character and is in the mainstream of brick church building around middle of the twentieth century.\n\nTaking Stock\n\nFirst siting of Stymie Bold Italic/Profil since Devon\n\nSadly the Hovercraft Museum was closed – Founded 1987 as a registered charity, the Museum Trust is the worlds greatest collection of Hovercraft archive, film, and historic craft, dating back to to John Thonycroft’s 1870 air lubricated boat models and the then Dr. Cockerell’s 1955 annular jet experiments.\n\nSo excited to be boarding yet another ferry.\n\nSeeing Portsmouth for the first time in a long time.\n\nFinding cheap digs at the Rydeview Hotel.\n\nMy partner and daughter stayed here recently and the warm reception we received was great, thought it was going to be real value for money however when getting into the family room, which was a decent size, the curtain was half hanging down, iron marks and stains on the carpet, dirty windows, mould on the bathroom ceiling, hole in the bathroom floor and a very random shower head coming from the toilet that was very unpleasant. When we checked in we asked about breakfast and we were told this was going to be an additional £3 – we thought this was great value for money for a full English only to be left hungry and out of pocket! My daughter had one slice of toast, we asked for the full English what we received was cold and hard beans, and un-cooked egg and a rank sausage, the eating area was dirty – cobwebs everywhere.\n\nI too stayed in the Family room with a delightful mouse for company and enjoyed one of the worst meals I’ve ever not eaten.\n\nI headed for the 5th Hants Volunteers where I formally kept company with Felim Egan, Norman Taylor and Ian Hunter way back when.\n\nDrinking Gales HSB – formerly a local brew now owned by Fullers\n\nEstablished in 1847 Gales Brewery (George Gale & Co. Ltd) was an old brewery situated in Horndean, on the edge of Waterlooville. It made the nutty HSB – Horndean Special Bitter and the newer Gales Bitter. It took its water from its own well situated under the brewery which is fed from the South Downs, and the yeast and liquor, coupled with the local brewing style, produced beers with a sparse head, quite dark in colour.\n\nIn late 2005 Fuller’s Brewery bought Gales for £92 million. In January 2006, Fuller’s began cutting jobs at the Horndean brewery, and it was announced on 27 February 2006 that the brewery would close at the end of March 2006, although distribution and warehousing would continue in the area.\n\nIt didn’t tater the same and the pub had been gutted – gutted.\n\nI beat a retreat to the Barley Mow – where I fell in with a gang of former Poly students from the 70s – they had studied and never left.\n\nEventually we all left.\n\nNight night.\n\nWake up Steve put the mini-kettle on!\n\nGet down for breakfast – I personally regret the untimely passing of fried bread and the appearance of the so-called hash brown.\n\nOriginally, the full name of the dish was hashed brown potatoes or hashed browned potatoes, of which the first known mention is by American food author Maria Parloa in her 1887 Kitchen Companion, where she describes the dish of hashed and browned potatoes as a fried mixture of cold boiled potatoes which is folded like an omelet before serving.\n\nYears later we got them.\n\nThursday 30th July 2015 and the sun is a shining brightly on the Dart.\n\nGet on the ferry!\n\nWe’re off again.\n\nThe Monkey Puzzle tree Araucaria araucana is one of the oldest trees in the business – of being a tree.\n\nIt is native to central and southern Chile, western Argentina, and a welcome visitor to the English Riviera.\n\nThe hardiest species in the conifer genus.

In this year, a 210 foot wooden jetty was built, but unfortunately it was washed away in 1843. It was then replaced with another slightly longer one, 240 foot, which lasted until 1890. This one was also destroyed by the stormy seas and the remains were consequently sold at auction for £40.\n\nFollowing this, very sensibly, an iron jetty was built that was 500 foot long, together with a bandstand which was eventually extended into a pavilion.\n\nDuring the war Cromer Pier was sectioned for defence purposes.\n\nThe poor Pier also had its fair share of being damaged too, which I suppose is understandable, being stuck out in the sea!\n\nExplore Norfolk\n\nSt Magaret Witton-by-Walsham one of the enchanting Norfolk churches I passed by and the only one I entered. It had provision for an unattended brew and home made cake, just the job.\n\nThe church is an elegant, well-kept, peaceful building, but it is also rather quirky. There are two splayed round windows in the lower north side of the nave it seems reasonable to think that they are genuine Saxon windows, and this is a genuine Saxon piece of wall. As is the lower part of the south wall, for both sides have long and short work ironstone blocks forming the corners with the west wall.\n\nIn the early 14th Century they began to expand the church, but rather than rebuild it they heightened the existing walls, which is why the tower and the church still make an awkward juxtaposition even today. There is a clerestory on both sides of the church, but an aisle only to the south, contemporary with the clerestory, rather than with the 15th century crowning of the tower with a bell stage and battlements.\n\nWhen the Tudors extended the tower, they needed a way for people to get up to the bell stage. Rather than build a stairway inside the tower in the conventional manner, they built a stair turret inside the church, against the west wall of the nave, which is at once awkward and intriguing. Tucked in beside the stair turret is a large converted barrel organ. I remembered the late Tom Muckley observing that small villages like this usually owned just one barrel organ, which was used in the church on Sunday and then moved to the pub for the rest of the week.\n\nNorfolk Churches\n\nWell there you are an unfitting end to a grand tour.\n\nWhat have we learned along the way?\n\nEveryone I met along the way was both helpful and friendly – save for a minor rebuttal in Southend.\n\nThe coast is plural and singular, whilst there may well be typologies to be found, the variations within are manifold.\n\nIt pays to take time to look around, slow down from time to time, rest your legs, open you eyes.\n\nSand and cameras do not mix.\n\nGood night John Boy, good night Ma, goodnight Pa – night night Steve.\n\nWe all learned a lot today on the Modern Mooch\n\nI’ll let Bobby Bland have the last word.\n\nDay three Wednesday 3rd September – leaving Southend under a cloud.\n\nThe huge slab of the Civic Centre shrouded in sea mist\n\nOops actually Alexander House – built around 1970 to house the then new V.A.T. HQ.\n\nDesigned by borough architect – PF Burridge.\n\nQueen Mum Opens Civic Centre – It took a while to get there, since 1958 when the council agreed to embark on a quest to build a new home for itself; but on 31st October 1967 HRH the Queen Mother did the honours and formally opened the spanking new Civic Centre. During its build Southend was classed as being in the top ten in the country for full employment, due to this workers were hard to come by and bus loads of workers were brought in to complete this and the many other projects shooting up along Victoria Avenue at the same time.\n\nCllr Beryl Scholfield commented later on the day – The Queen Mother opened the Civic Centre in 1967, when my husband was chairman of the town hall committee, and we had lunch with her at Porters. We were presented to her when she came in. There were no more than about 30 of us there. It was a most exciting day.\n\nShe was as natural as you see her on the television.\n\nPostscript 2002\n\nA Union Jack lowered to half-mast in tribute to the Queen Mum has been stolen from Southend’s Civic Centre. A council spokeswoman today denounced the theft as – a despicable act at a time of great sadness and national mourning.\n\nThe outrage has caused extra sadness for royalist residents in the town because of the Queen Mother’s special place in the history of the Civic Centre.\n\nThe Leda and the Swan statue by Lucette Cartwright, which used to be in the Civic Centre atrium, gets a polish in May 1987.\n\nA bronze statue depicting a mythological rape has finally found a new home at the mayor of Southend’s official residence. The controversial statue of Leda and the Swan was specially commissioned by Southend Council in the Sixties and first stood outside the courthouse in Victoria Avenue.\n\nLater it was moved to the Civic Square and then to the courtyard of the Palace Theatre, in Westcliff. Later, it was moved to the Civic Centre when it caused outrage among staff. Workers claimed the statue, representing the rape of Leda by the Greek god Zeus disguised as a swan, glorified rape as an art form.\n\nLast week, the statue was removed from the Civic Centre and is now at the mayor’s residence, Porters, in Southend.\n\nRob Tinlin, Southend Council’s chief executive and town clerk said – The statue of Leda and the Swan was located at the Civic Centre until a suitable location was found. The statue is permanently on display in the garden of the mayor’s residence, Porters in Southchurch Road.\n\nIt is in an appropriately landscaped area next to the pond.\n\nMisty eyed I missed the sculptural fountain – William Mitchell I presume?\n\nSaid farewell to Neptunes unilluminating assorted fish.\n\nHeading out of town past noisy scenes of quiet despair, no more fancy goods, no more confectionary – shake that.\n\nHeading inland, away from the wibbly wobbly estuarine coast of higgledy piggledy Essex, through freshly mown pasture and solitary haywains.\n\nThis is Constable country:\n\nLike many artists practising at the time, Constable used sketches as source material for fully worked-up compositions. He did not find the production of finished paintings easy, which probably contributed to his late recognition by the art establishment.\n\nV&A\n\nPassing by solitary bus shelters, patiently awaiting passengers.\n\nWaterworks works in the palatial neo-classical manner, with a restrained nod to incipient Art Deco.\n\nEncountering the occasional leafy lane.\n\nI eventually found myself on the outskirts of Colchester, outside St Theresa Of Lisieux .\n\nA striking pre-cast concrete frame design of 1971, with a dramatic and well-lit interior, lively modulation of wall surfaces and some furnishings and artworks of note.\n\nArchitect – JH Dabrowski\n\nThe entrance façade has a large gable and projecting entrance canopy, above which is a bronze statue of the Risen Christ, by local artist Tita Madden – 1977\n\nThis is a large modern church, built with a pre-cast concrete frame with a crossover roof beam system, allowing for dramatic internal effects. Within the bays created by the frame, the walling is mostly brick, with some pre-cast concrete panels, and large areas of glazing. Concrete is also used for the window mullions and surrounds. Each bay has the brickwork slightly angled or faceted, giving the design a great sense of movement and liveliness, both inside and out.\n\nTaking Stock\n\nStruggling to go around a Straight Road.\n\n£240,000 will get you an Art Deco maisonette in Vint Crescent from Wowhaus:\n\nThis one is a ground floor apartment, which has undergone a complete refurbishment, but with one on keeping those period features to the fore – period features such as original radiators and those distinctive windows and doors are intact, rubbing shoulders with some new, high-end finishes like oak floors and updated kitchen and bathroom.\n\nFoolishly I became more than somewhat lost and on making enquiries concerning my whereabouts and destination, I was met with gently derisive laughter. Therefore, I bypassed Colchester, took the wrong route along a mainly main road and ended up much too quickly in Clacton.\n\nHome to several shops to let, as we shall subsequently see.\n\nAlso home to a fabulous concrete frieze on the exterior wall of the library.\n\nQuickly ensconced in my bijou digs – I hit the town to take a look around.\n\nI was staying right opposite this here boozer – a little too early for a pint, I’ll pop back in a bit.\n\nSeaside shelter in a faux vernacular manner, calm seas ‘neath an azure sky – perfect.\n\nArtifice and authenticity the sunbathing citizens sit beside an inflatable pool – perched above the sea on the pier.\n\nClacton Pier, which opened on 27 July 1871 was officially the first building erected in the then-new resort of Clacton-on-Sea. A wooden structure 160 yards in length and 4 yards wide, the pier served as a landing point for goods and passengers, a docking point for steamships operated by the Woolwich Steam Packet Company, and a popular spot for promenading. By 1893, Clacton had become such a popular destination for day trippers that the pier was lengthened to 1180 ft (360m) and entertainment facilities, including a pavilion and a waiting room, were added to accommodate them.\n\nWikipedia\n\nThe pier seems to have changed hands several times, as is the way with such things, subjected to fires, storms and pestilence – yet still prevails.\n\nKey attractions include Stella’s Revenge – a family Galaxi rollercoaster. Formerly operated at Barry Island Pleasure Park as Galaxy, and later Viper.\n\nPause to consider the prospect of magical fun, fun, fun.\n\nLet’s return to dry land, where we find certain signs of decline in these uncertain times.\n\nHope springs eternal in the Arcade hairdressers.\n\nWe place our trust in the tried and tested condiments of this most sceptered of isles.\n\nLife goes on at the Linen Shop – yet another Profil/Stymie gem!\n\nA limited choice is widely available from the far from extensive menu, though mushrooms do come with princely, premium price tag attached.\n\nAnother long day closes with a well deserved pint – God bless the Old Lifeboat House and all who sail in her.\n\nNight night."
