        "text": "Currently trading as Spaces.\n\nTake in all the best that Manchesterâ€™s creative scene has to offer and let your imagination go wild.\n\nIn 1807 you really had to use your imagination to discover the creative scene.\n\nThe site was home to the Princeâ€™s Theatre:\n\nConstructed by Metcalf and Waterson at a cost of Â£20,000, and designed by the architect Edward Salomons. The Theatre, which had seating for 1,590, opened with a production of Shakespeareâ€™s â€˜The Tempestâ€™ on Saturday, October the 15th 1864, under the management of Charles Calvert.\n\nArthur Lloyd\n\nSadly the Princeâ€™s Theatre was closed in April 1940 when it was sold to ABC Cinemas who planned to build a new Cinema complex on the site, the Theatre was subsequently demolished but because of the war â€“ the new Cinema was never built\n\nIt was replaced by Rediffusion House â€“ later Peter House architects Ansell & Bailey.\n\nTopped out in 1957 with a pint of Chesterâ€™s Mild.\n\nPeter House gracefully hugs the curve of Oxford Street as it leads into St. Peterâ€™s Square. This was one of the earliest commercial buildings to be completed post-war, which demonstrates the slow economic recovery of the region. Built on a site that had been bombed, the Portland stone seemed to marry with the material narrative established by JW Beaumont and LC Howitt in their buildings of the 1950â€™s and following earlier interwar commercial buildings. This scheme has more panache than the rather serious facades of the Student Union building or the Law Courts though.\n\nThe stepped massing and the articulation of the wings of the building preclude the accepted commercial norm of developing to the edge of the site and instead promote a satisfying formal interplay between the six and eleven storey elements. The building has been sensitively modified despite a lack of any listed status and remains commercially viable as offices and as retail. The continued success may be attributed to the air of quality afforded by the stone, certainly it has ensured the longevity, particularly when one considers the fate that befell the easement hugging concrete of Elizabeth House â€“ Cruickshank & Seward, 1971 across the road; it was demolished in 2012.\n\nMainstream Modern\n\nRediffusion was the first independent commercial TV franchisee, in 1956 Associated-Rediffusion struck a very lucrative deal with Granada Television, the franchise holder for weekday broadcasts in the North of England.\n\nThe company offered a low-bandwidth cable TV and radio distribution system, provided in most United Kingdom towns. Selection of TV or radio station was by means of a rotary switch, usually mounted on a wall or window frame close to the point of entry of the cable into the home.\n\nThe Rediffusion retail chain, renting and servicing TVs, radios, VCRs and hi-fi systems, was common on high streets until it was bought by Granada Rentals in 1984.\n\nThe days of the monolithic mono-culture of the sole occupant are in decline â€“ we live in the age of the co-working space and homes of multi-use creative scene.\n\nPeter House prevails a pale white Portland Stone embodiment of different days and different ways.\n\nLetâ€™s take a walk around.\n\nAs a footnote â€“ once in the shadow of Peter House, Tommy Ducks was demolished overnight.\n\nApparently, its supporters managed to arrange a preservation order for the building but, according to the excellent Pubs of Manchester website, that order expired at midnight on February 12, 1993, and the pub was literally reduced to rubble before anyone could seek a renewal on February 13th.\n\nWhatâ€™s in a name?\n\nTaliesin (/ËŒtÃ¦lËˆiÉ›sÉªn/ tal-YES-in, Welsh: [talËˆjÉ›sÉªn]; fl. 6th century AD) was an early Brittonic poet of Sub-Roman Britain whose work has possibly survived in a Middle Welsh manuscript, the Book of Taliesin.\n\nTaliesin is the home, studio, and 800-acre agricultural estate of Frank Lloyd Wright. Wright built Taliesin on his favorite boyhood hill, in the Wisconsin River valley homesteaded by his Welsh grandparents. He named it Taliesin in honor of the Welsh bard whose name means Shining Brow, reflecting his belief that the crown of the hill was reserved for nature, and that buildings should be constructed at the brow of the hill.\n\nFrank Lloyd Wright\n\nIt is also a name commonly found on many of the common place dwellings of the Principality.\n\nTre-Taliesin is a village in Ceredigion nine miles south of Machynlleth.\n\nThe village is known for the Bedd Taliesin, a hilltop Bronze Age tumulus which is traditionally regarded as the site for the grave of the Welsh bard, Taliesin. It is listed as a Historic Monument. It is a round-kerb cairn with a cist about 2m long. The capstone has fallen; the side stone slabs are more or less in their original positions.\n\nWikipedia\n\nWhich brings us to Taliesin Cwmbran a group of 58 flats located at the northern end of a road named Forgeside.\n\nThis development is something of an anomaly, breaking the mould of the conventional New Town housing which surrounds it.\n\nBroadly Postmodern â€“ with passing references to half timbered buildings, yet with more contemporary cladding. A wandering profile and angular roofline which echoes Hollywood Medievalism, paired with a fortress like enclosure of space and scaled down passageways.\n\nSo far no architectural attribution â€“ any clues anyone?\n\nMacCormac Jamieson & Prichard 1981-82\n\nThanks to Richard Brook over at Mainstream Modern.\n\nMorris Buildings 11 Portland St Swansea SA1 3DH\n\nWelcome, at the Kardomah Cafe we have a long history of excellent service, great food and wonderful coffee. We are an independent, established, family run business of nearly 50 years. Traditional values are important to us and have helped us create a warm and friendly atmosphere, which is seen by many of our customers as an important part of their lives, a place to meet their friends, whilst enjoying quality food and drink.\n\nThe company that created the Kardomah brand began in Pudsey Street, Liverpool in 1844 as the Vey Brothers teadealers and grocers. In 1868 the business was acquired by the newly created Liverpool China and India Tea Company, and a series of brand names was created beginning with Mikado. The Kardomah brand of tea was first served at the Liverpool colonial exhibition of 1887, and the brand was later applied to a range of teas, coffees and coffee houses. The parent company was renamed Kardomah Limited in 1938. The brand was acquired by the Forte Group in 1962, sold to Cadbury Schweppes Typhoo in 1971, and became part of Premier Brands some time between 1980 and 1997. The brand still exists, selling items such as instant coffee and coffee whitener.\n\nThe Kardomah CafÃ©s in London and Manchester were designed by Sir Misha Black between 1936 and 1950.\n\nThe original Swansea branch was at 232 High St, and known as â€˜The Kardomah Exhibition Cafe & Tea Roomsâ€™, moving to the Castle Street in 1908.\n\nThe Castle Street cafe was the meeting place of The Kardomah Gang, which included Dylan Thomas, and was built on the site of the former Congregational Chapel where Thomasâ€™s parents were married in 1903. The cafe was bombed during WW2 and was later replaced by the present Kardomah Coffee Shop Restaurant in Portland Street.\n\nWikipedia\n\nAn in-depth history is available here.\n\nIâ€™d never had the pleasure of visiting a Kardomah before, imagine my delight when I was directed there by local artist, activist and archivist Catrin Saran James, during our delightful Swansea Moderne tour!\n\nFollowing an extensive walk from one end of town to the other, I returned there for a late midday bite to eat and a sit down â€“ it looked a little like this:\n\nMany thanks to the staff and customers for putting up with me wandering around for a while with my camera, whilst they worked and ate.\n\nDiolch yn fawr.\n\nHeading out of Hull one sunny Sunday morning along Sustrans Route 65.\n\nThe first leg of my journey northwards to Berwick, many thanks to all those kind souls who filled my water bottle, directed, redirected and misdirected me along my merry way.\n\nI suddenly found myself on Sustrans Route 66 â€“ nominally lost.\n\nGood fortune however had pointed me in the direction of this functional yet charming brick built church, on the edge of a huge roundabout â€“ St Mary Queen of Martyrs RC in Bransholme.\n\nThe new St Mary Queen of Martyrs church was built at Bransholme in 1976-7 and the old St Maryâ€™s church closed and demolished in 1982.\n\nArchitect for the new church was JT Reid of The Reid Partnership â€“ Pontefract.\n\nThe entrance graced by these textured fascias.\n\nFollowing a series of brief engagements with various local benefactors, I regained my intended route and joined the Hornsea Rail Trail â€“ the bed of the former branch line.\n\nThe line was officially opened on 28 March 1864, the last passenger train ran on 19 October 1964.\n\nGoods traffic continued to use the line as far as Hornsea Bridge until 3 May 1965.\n\nThe place-name Swine is first attested in the Domesday Book of 1086, where it appears as Swine.\n\nIt appears as Suine in a charter of circa 1150, the name perhaps derives from the Old English swin meaning creek.\n\nWikipedia\n\nAnd being Sunday, it was shut.\n\nI tarried a while on the well appointed seafront.\n\nGliding along leafy, green hedge-lined lanes.\n\nFollowing a dead end lane to the place of dead roads.\n\nSkipsea â€“ home to Crossways Fish & Chips\n\nHere you will be offered perfectly cooked fish.\n\nRetracing and crossing the Yorkshire Wolds.\n\nZigging and zagging here and there, in search of a route, any route, I came upon Okanagan â€“ a delightful asymmetric Prairie Style modern home.\n\nFiley Road, Gristhorpe, Filey, Scarborough, North Yorkshire â€“ currently valued at Â£562,000.\n\nThe interior decorative order currently out of synch with the post war exterior.\n\nHurrying along to reach town by tea time â€“ I descended deftly into Scarborough.\n\nWhere I hooked up with local lad Ben Vickers for a pint in the North Riding Hotel.\n\nThe rest is, as they say â€“ a mystery.\n\nWhilst cycling twixt Redcar and Newcastle one sunny Monday morn, I espied a tower on the distant horizon.\n\nI pedalled hurriedly along and this is what I found.\n\nDawson House aka Kingsway.\n\nHistoric England\n\nAcross the way the cosmically named Astronaut pub known locally as the Aggy.\n\nThough all it seems, is not well in outer space:\n\nLocals say punters are creating a giant toilet next to a Billingham pub â€“ and performing sex acts.\n\nI wouldnâ€™t disregard what they say, and I canâ€™t say that didnâ€™t happen, said boss Jordan Mulloy.\n\nI know urinating goes on from time to time but people do it outside every pub â€“ anyone I catch doing it will be barred.\n\nTeeside News\n\nThe pub stands at the outer edge of the West Precinct.\n\nThe precinct sits beneath the Civic Offices.\n\nAnd has a ramp leading to the roof top parking.\n\nNext door the earlier Queensway Centre.\n\nThe Family unveiled by HRM Queen Elizabeth II in 1967 the countryâ€™s first pedestrianised precinct.\n\nEdward Bainbridge Copnall\n\nIn November 2013, a time capsule was buried in front of The Family, under a stone with the inscription Forever Forward 30 11 2013.\n\nThe capsule is not to be unearthed until the year 2078.\n\nTwenty million pound bid to take back control of the centre of Billingham.\n\nThe council says: Proposals include addressing the physical condition of Billingham town centre in support the Councilâ€™s ambition to take back control of the centre. Redevelopment would solve the challenges of changing retail trends that are contributing towards excess retail space and high vacancy rates.\n\nThis includes exploring options for mixed-use redevelopment and high-quality public spaces that improve accessibility within the town centre and a modern retail offering.\n\nHartlepool Mail.\n\nMissing in action â€“ La Ronde aka Eleanor Rigbyâ€™s.\n\nBuilt in 1968 by local architects Elder Lester and Partners as part of the expansive plans for the town centre along with the Forum, La Ronde nightclub was to form part of the expansive plans for Billingham focused on the pursuit of increased leisure time.\n\nLa Rondeâ€™s distinct cylindrical form comes from the car park access ramp that winds around the stair core to the upper floors of the club. The elevated drum-like form inset with cross latticed concrete webs was cast entirely in-situ.\n\nIn 2006, the council demolished La Ronde and Forum House at the cost of Â£500,000 to make way for a supermarket.\n\nThe Forum\n\nIn 1960, Billingham Urban District Council, began one of the most ambitious new leisure centres in Europe. The Forum was funded by the districtâ€™s new-found wealth â€“ a product of the local petrochemical industry. It was designed by local architects Elder Lester and Partners and brought together a variety of recreational activities including an ice rink, swimming pool, sports centre, theatre, and bar all under one roof. The Forum opened in July 1967 to great enthusiasm. Weekly attendance over the first six months was between 20 000 and 30 000 people, far exceeding all expectations.\n\nThe inclusion of the theatre alongside the sports facilities broke new ground in recreational planning and in the shift from sport to the broader notion of â€˜leisureâ€™, the Forum predated architectural thinking of the time by nearly a decade. The buildingâ€™s form is derived from the functions within, expressed in a variety of bulbous elements. The most distinctive is the canopy of the ice rink roof which is hung using steel cables running the length of the roof and cross-braced to achieve a clear 73m span.\n\nSomething Concrete and Modern\n\n799 Wilmslow Rd Didsbury Manchester M20 2RR\n\nI was here, once upon a time, studying to be an art teacher â€“ which eventually I was, then I wasnâ€™t.\n\nSuch is life, things that is eventually isnâ€™t, such is the story of this here site.\n\nFacts courtesy of Wikipedia\n\nAccording to local historian Diana Leitch, the site has been in use since 1465; the first house was built in 1603 as part of a large estate with a deer park.\n\nIn 1740 the site was purchased by the Broome family, and a new house was constructed after 1785 by William Broome, extant today as the front part of the universityâ€™s former administration building, now known as Sandhurst House.\n\nBy 1812 the house was occupied by a Colonel Parker, and in the 1820s and â€™30s it was a girlsâ€™ school.\n\nThe site was purchased by the Wesleyan Methodist Church on 18 March 1841 for Â£2,000, and opened as a theological college on 22 September 1842.\n\nThe Old Chapel building, originally the college chapel, is a two-storey building constructed in gothic style, with Flemish bond brickwork, built on a sandstone plinth in 1842. The structure consists of three wings, containing a central hall range, with two domestic wings on each side, initially used as tutor accommodation, forming a symmetrical appearance with the gable end of the upper hall. For many years it was used as a library and lecture theatre.\n\nThe ground floor eventually became the student union, and contained a bar and cafÃ©.\n\nDuring both world wars the site was used as a military hospital. In 1943 the Board of Education had begun to consider the future of education, following reforms that would inevitably come after the war ended. It was estimated that with the raising of the school leaving age, following the 1944 Education Act, about 70,000 new teachers would be needed annually, almost ten times as many as before the war.\n\nIn 1944 a report was produced by the Board of Education on the emergency recruitment and training of teachers, and it was decided that there were to be several new training colleges set up. These colleges were to be staffed by lecturers seconded from local authorities, with mature students selected from National Service conscripts. In 1945 the theological college, which was no longer required by the Wesleyans, was leased to the Manchester Education Authority. The new emergency training college was officially opened on 31 January 1946, with Alfred Body as its first principal.\n\nBy 1950, the emergency college was purchased by the City of Manchester and made permanent as Didsbury Teacher Training College, with an initial enrolment of about 250 male and female students. As a result of becoming a permanent college, Didsbury became part of Manchester Universityâ€™s School of Education.\n\nOver the next two decades, numerous buildings were constructed on the site; Behrens, Birley and Simon were all named after prominent local families with ties to the college.\n\nDidsbury became part of Manchester Polytechnic in 1977, renamed Didsbury School of Education.\n\nThe adjacent Broomhurst halls of residence have since been demolished.\n\nBoth Sandhurst House and the Old Chapel are Grade II listed â€“ the architect was probably Richard Lane.\n\nAs of 2018 the site is being redeveloped by local architects PJ Livesey, as a residential area of 93 homes, with the listed buildings being retained.\n\nHereâ€™s a record of my visit, to the soon to be demolished site, in April 2015.\n\nArchive photographs Local Image Collection.\n\nHere we are again â€“ in a spin, oh what a spin that Iâ€™m in.\n\nUp and down the spiral ramp, the eternal allure of the unknown and forbidden, walking the way of the motor car.\n\nI was in town on an overcast day, prior to a Covid jab appointment, what better way to relax and reflect on our current condition, here on this whirling sphere.\n\nA transgressive trip to a twisted world of spiral delights.\n\nStockport, Hull and London have all been previously explored â€“ here we are now going up the back of the Plaza.\n\nThe work of architects Covell-Matthews Partners, further details here at Mainstream Modern.\n\nThe car park ramp serviced the Piccadilly, now Mercure Piccadilly Hotel; one of the three main elements of Piccadilly Plaza, along with City Tower and the late lamented Bernard House.\n\nIn its day, synonymous with Manchesterâ€™s emergent manifestly modern image â€“ scene of Albert Finneyâ€™s homecoming, in the film Charlie Bubbles.\n\nAnd also used, in the then fabulously glamorous Dee Time â€“ host Simon Dee descending the ramp in his â€˜E Typeâ€™ Jaguar.\n\nLegend has it, that the ramp was the location for an unlikely encounter between architect Louis Kahn and top pop combo The Commodores.\n\nThe reception drop off was at first floor level and was accessed from street level by a helical ramp. My fatherâ€™s dilapidated Renault 4 van gave up just near the top. Extremely embarrassed, my father asked Kahn to move over to the driverâ€™s seat and steer, whilst he attempted to push the van the rest of the way. As he began to push a people carrier pulled up behind and out stepped a group of men who began to help. Soon the van was outside the reception and my father and Kahn thanked the men.\n\nThe young female receptionist was very excited: â€˜Do you know who just pushed your car up the ramp? The Commodores!â€™\n\nThe RIBA Journal\n\nHang on to your hats lets take a trip up the helix.\n\nAnd down again.\n\nNB The Modern Moocher neither advocates nor encourages the pedestriansâ€™ invasion of the motor carsâ€™ private spaces.\n\nLet it be known throughout the land, that it is at heart, a very, very daft and dangerous thing to do.\n\nWe begin at the beginning of the end â€“ fields full of fields\n\nDotted with farm buildings â€“ then, along comes an Aerodrome.\n\nA serious problem arose in 1924 when Avro was notified that the current airfield used by the company at Alexandra Park would be closing. After a hurried search to find an alternative location, Avro settled on New Hall Farm at Woodford and completed the move later that year.\n\nIn 1999, Woodford became part of BAE Systems as a result of the merging of British Aerospace with Marconi Electronic Systems. Plans to build the Avro RJX airliner at Woodford were shelved in 2001 which left production of the Nimrod MRA4 as the only active project at the site. Woodford Aerodrome finally closed in 2011 when the Nimrod MRA4 project was cancelled, ending almost 80 years of almost continual aircraft manufacture at the site.\n\nAvro Heritage Museum\n\nWhich in due course became a museum.\n\nThe site was subsequently acquired by Redrow.\n\nRedrow has started construction on the first phase of 950 homes at the 500-acre former Woodford Aerodrome site near Stockport, nearly two years after planning consent was granted.\n\nPreparatory works are underway and sales of the houses are expected to launch in June with the opening of show homes on the site.\n\nThe redevelopment of the 500-acre site, which is being brought forward by a joint venture between Harrow Estates, part of Redrow, and Avro Heritage, will also feature a primary school, employment area, pub, shops, community facilities, and areas of open and recreational space.\n\nPlace Northwest\n\nA 21st century development was on its way.\n\nHowever, the architectural style owes more to Baron Hardup, than Flash Gordon.\n\nThe Tudor-Bethan style of Metro-Land, that oh so very, very English pantomime tradition of the village green, merry boys and girls dancing around Maypoles clutching wicker baskets, full of plastic daffodils.\n\nFor every raw obscenity\n\nMust have its small â€˜amenity,â€™\n\nIts patch of shaven green,\n\nAnd hoardings look a wonder\n\nIn banks of floribunda\n\nWith floodlights in between.\n\nJohn Betjeman Inexpensive Progress\n\nThis is progress realised as regression, a pastiche of a pastiche, of a pastiche, of a pastiche.\n\nFinding some small comfort in the imitation game, hurtling along radial roads, encased in the biggest, live now pay later motors, which borrowed money can buy.\n\nSeeking succour in the certainty of an illusory past, whilst peering through the nets and blinds, at a seriously uncertain future.\n\nYouâ€™re as pretty as a picture, a picture torn from a yellowing scrapbook, scanned and enhanced, to remove any unseemly rough edges and/or ruffians.\n\nThis was tomorrow calling, wishing you werenâ€™t here.\n\nWork is still underway and the surrounding landscape feels raw, windswept and wounded.\n\nAll of the plots on this phase are now reserved, but donâ€™t miss out on the available homes on our other phases!\n\nJust minutes from Wilmslow, Poynton and Bramhall, and within easy reach of Manchester for both work and leisure, Woodford is perfectly placed to offer the best of both the thriving city and the glorious Cheshire countryside. This makes it the perfect location for our high-quality Heritage Collection homes, which combine the very best of classic Arts & Crafts architecture with modern, family friendly interiors of the very highest specification.\n\nRedrow\n\nThe Oxford, Richmond, Leamington, Lincoln and Canterbury â€“ reassuringly reassuring you, that you are in fact â€“ nowhere.\n\nThis is it you have arrived â€“ a gold-star, cast iron, paper thin investment for a certain aspirational section of society.\n\nGoodbye Woodford Garden Village.\n\nNow if the harvest is over, and the world cold, give me the bonus of laughter, as I lose hold.\n\nIn my memory of days long gone by, I call to mind the stops strewn around St Michaelâ€™s Square â€“ all points east I assume, Stalybridge, Mossley, Micklehurst, Dukinfield, Glossop and beyond.\n\nPrior to 1963, Ashton-under-Lyneâ€™s buses and trolleybuses stopped at a variety of termini throughout the town centre. Manchester Corporation services called at Bow Street and Old Square, by Yatesâ€™ Wine Lodge; Ashton-under-Lyne Corporationâ€™s buses opted for Market Street and Wellington Road by the town hall.\n\nSHMDâ€™s stopped at St. Michaelâ€™s Square.\n\nSo says Mancunian 1001 so sagely.\n\nIn 1927 thereâ€™s no room for a bus station, the townâ€™s full of old houses.\n\nBut following extensive demolition, the site was cleared for a brand new bus station, with toilets, shops, offices, staff canteen and depot.\n\nTo be followed by the completion of the Shopping Precinct, Beau Geste and Ashton Arms.\n\nAshton zooms forward into the future, its flat-roofed modern facilities complemented by ranks of low-level shelters and edged to the east by a walled lawn and flower bed â€“ where we all loved to sit of a sunny day.\n\nAnd the under the cover of the canopy at night, ready for the time of your life, at the Birdcage, pub or pictures.\n\nI remember the kiosk on the corner, a jewellers around the other corner.\n\nIâ€™ll meet you under the clock.\n\nPhoto: Ron Stubley\n\nHere we see that the original shelters have been replaced and realigned.\n\nTemporary Queensbury shelters were put in place prior to the addition of GMPTEâ€™s standard shelters, seen in Stockport and Oldham bus stations. By the close of 1983, the recognisable GMPTE ones emerged. The cover at the precinct end was later glazed and became stands A to C.\n\nThe second version of Ashton-under-Lyneâ€™s bus station opened on the 18 March 1985. After two and a half years refurbishment work, it was opened at 11.30 by Councillor Geoffrey Brierley.\n\nMancunian 101\n\nAnd thatâ€™s the corner where we would deck off the open backed buses, hitting the pavement at speed.\n\nThatâ€™s the deep blue and cream Ashton livery later superseded by SELNEC, GMPTE and TFGM â€“ the wonderful full fare, unfair world of Margaret Hilda Thatcherâ€™s privatisation, Arriva, First and Stagecoach first.\n\nThen in the 1995 with the development of the Arcades Shopping centre, the whole site is reconfigured, now seen nestling in the shadow of the Dustbin.\n\nThough as we know, nothing lasts forever and the shelters, passengers and buses get shunted and rebuilt yet again,\n\nEven the Dustbin has gone west.\n\nOpening in 2020 â€“ the current version.\n\nThe majority of photographs are taken from online sources â€“ please contact me if you are aware of the authorâ€™s name â€“ I will post a credit.\n\nIâ€™ll be posting some pictures of my visit to this brand new Interchange, mixing it up with trams, trains and a tuppence one to the Cross.\n\nOne of the great glories of cinema is that it has the power to take the mundane and make it magical. To most of us, car parks signify a world of pain, where fearsome red-and-white crash barriers dictate our fate and where finding a space is often like finding meaning in the collective works of Martin Lawrence. To others, they meant lost Saturday afternoons spent waiting for your mum to finally come out of Woolworths so you could rush home to catch Terrahawks.\n\nEither way, car parks are grey and dull. In the movies, however, they are fantastic places, filled with high-level espionage, and high-octane chases.\n\nAccording to The Guardian\n\nI beg to differ, the cinema and TV has helped to define our perception and misconception of the car park.\n\nThe modern day pedestrian may reclaim, redefine and realise, that far from mundane each actual exemplar is different, in so many ways. The time of day, weather, light, usage, abusage, condition, personal demeanour and mood all shape our experience of this particular, modern urban space.\n\nTo walk the wide open spaces of the upper tier, almost touching the sky.\n\nIs a far cry from the constrained space of the lower levels.\n\nTo walk the ramps with a degree of trepidation, visceral and fun.\n\nThis is an inversion of the car-centric culture, walking the concrete kingdom with a carbon-free footprint.\n\nI was inspired by a recent viewing of All The Presidents Men to revisit my local multi-storey on Heaton Lane Stockport.\n\nCinematographer Gordon Hugh Willis Jr constructs a shadow world where informer and informed meet to exchange deep secrets, ever watchful, moving in and out of artificial light, tense and alert.\n\nLook over your shoulder- thereâ€™s nobody there, and theyâ€™re watching you.\n\nBut they have been here.\n\nTo party.\n\nTo tag.\n\nTo live.\n\nPay here, your time is time limited, your presence measured.\n\nLetâ€™s explore this demimonde together, wet underfoot, lit laterally by limited daylight, walking through the interspersed pools of glacial artificial glow.\n\nTimeâ€™s up, check out and move on â€“ tomorrow is another day, another car park; in a different town.\n\nCinema and car parks wedded forever in the collective popular cultural unconscious.\n\nHaving started in the middle, letâ€™s fast forward to the end â€“ the beginning will have to wait.\n\nWe take up our walk along Fredâ€™s Way once more by Mirrlees Fields.\n\nFollowing the brook along the narrow shallow valley, betwixt and between houses.\n\nBriefly opening out into green open space.\n\nCrossing the road and entering the detached world of the detached house.\n\nNo two the same or your money back!\n\nDiving feet first into Happy Valley, home to the Lady Brook stream.\n\nAnd quickly out again.\n\nEmerging once again into the space between spaces.\n\nThe suburban idyll of the Dairyground Estate home to very few semi-skilled and unskilled manual workers; those on state benefit/unemployed, and lowest grade workers.\n\nBut home to an interesting array of Post War housing.\n\nIncluding examples of the style de jour, Ã  la mode conversions and updates extended and rendered, black, white and grey symbols of success or extensive extended credit facilities.\n\nThough the more traditional fairy tale variant still has a space and place, in the corner of some well behaved cul de sac.\n\nUnder the railway â€“ through a low tunnel darkly.\n\nWe struck oil, black gold, Texas Tea â€“ Tate Oil.\n\nThe area of Little Australia â€“ so called as all the roads are named after towns in Australia, is bordered by the West Coast Main Line to the north, the Bramhall oil terminal to the east, Bramhall village centre to the west and Moorend Golf Club to the south.\n\nWe emerged into a warren of obfuscation, dead ends and conflicting signs, having made enquiries of the passing populace, we realigned with the new bypass.\n\nPassing over the conveniently placed footbridge over the bypass and beyond.\n\nEmerging amongst faux beams and real Monkey Puzzles.\n\nIt was at this point that, unbeknownst to us, we followed a twisted sign, misdirecting us along an overgrown path â€“ to Handforth.\n\nWe failed, in the end we failed to arrive to arrive at the end.\n\nHeading west like headless chickens towards the Turkey Farm.\n\nMaking our way mistakenly to Handforth Dean Retail Park â€“ rear of.\n\nCrossing slip roads with no pedestrian access and the forbidden territory of an industrial sized gymnasium car park.\n\nWoodford will just have to wait, another day another dolorous excursion.\n\nWe walked wearily back to Stockport.\n\nMonday 3rd August 2015 one finds oneself wide wake in the Rydeview Hotel.\n\nFaced with a breakfast best described as indescribable.\n\nI arose and departed, not angry but hungry.\n\nMade my way to the corner of Southsea Common, where once we drank â€“ Tim Rushton and I were often to be found in The Wheelbarrow together.\n\nA boozer no longer, now named for the cityâ€™s long gone famous son.\n\nHow bad a pub is this? I walk past it to get to my local. Most nights there are six people max in the bar, all huddled around the bar itself, backs to the door. â€“ this often includes the landlord and landlady. They have live music there once in a while and you canâ€™t get served by the one bloke behind the bar â€“ the landlord and landlady never help out, they donâ€™t seem to give a toss.\n\nBeers crap, not worth a visit.\n\nIt was never like that in our day.\n\nVisiting our former abode on Shaftesbury Road â€“ where I once dwelt along with Tim, Catherine, Liz and Trish.\n\nYet more Stymie Bold Italic.\n\nBack to the front for a peer at the pier.\n\nClarence Pier is an amusement pier located next to Southsea Hoverport. Unlike most seaside piers in the UK, the pier does not extend very far out to sea and instead goes along the coast.\n\nThe pier was originally constructed and opened in 1861 by the Prince and Princess of Wales and boasted a regular ferry service to the Isle of Wight. It was damaged by air raids during World War II and was reopened in its current form on 1 June 1961 after being rebuilt by local architects AE Cogswell & Sons and R Lewis Reynish.\n\nLow cloud grey skies and drizzle.\n\nThis sizeable two bedroom apartment situated on the seventh floor of the ever popular Fastnet House is offered with no onward chain and the option of a new 999 year lease as well as a share of the freehold. With panoramic views over The Solent towards the Isle Of Wight and Spinnaker Tower, situated in a central location and close to all amenities, this lovely apartment offers luxury living for any prospective buyer. With lift access, the apartment comprises; entrance hallway, a large lounge diner with box bay window boasting stunning sea views across the city and The Solent, master bedroom with built in wardrobes and sea views over The Solent, a spacious second bedroom, fitted kitchen with breakfast bar and a recently updated modern shower room.\n\nOn The Market Â£365,000\n\nWe are fully stocked with house coal, smokeless coal, kindling and fire lighters, fire grates, companion sets and fire tools.\n\nChristmas lights have also arrived.\n\nBrockenhurstâ€™s traditional hardware shop since 1926\n\nGhost garage.\n\nGhost post.\n\nCoal Exchange â€“ Peter and Dawn welcome you to their traditional pub in the heart of Emsworth adjacent to the public car park in South Street and close to the harbour.\n\nLillywhite Bros Ltd is a family run business established over 60 years ago in Emsworth, which is ideally located between Portsmouth and Chichester. It is currently run by brothers Paul and Mike who continue to keep up with modern techniques and equipment, as well as maintaining their traditional values and high standard of customer service.\n\nNext thing you know Iâ€™m in Pagham, having become very lost somewhere between there and here, asking for directions from the newsagents and buying a bottle of Oasis.\n\nThe newsagent was mildly amused by lack of map, sense and/or sensibility.\n\nI spent many happy hours here in my youth playing the slots with The King.\n\nWe would stay here in Tamarisk with my Aunty Alice and Uncle Arthur and Smudge the cat, an idyllic railway carriage shack two rows back from the pebbled seashore.\n\nWe would enjoy a shandy at the Kingâ€™s Beach with Lydia, Wendy and David.\n\nAll gone it seems.\n\nOn to Bognor a B&B and a brew â€“ a brief glimpse into my luxury lifestyle.\n\nIâ€™ll take an overcast Monday evening stroll along the prom, where I chanced to meet two landlocked Chinese lads, gazing amazed at the sea â€“ they were on a course in Chichester learning our own particular, peculiar ways.\n\nThere was no-one else around.\n\nWho can resit the obvious allure of the novelty item?\n\nOr an Art Deco garage fascia.\n\nFitzleet House was built in the 1960s architects: Donald Harwin & Partners, it consists of seventy four flats, fifteen of them are in a three-storey block next to the main building.\n\nPS&B are pleased to offer this sixth floor flat which is situated conveniently close to the town centre and within close proximity of the sea front. The accommodation is newly refurnbished and is offered unfurnished with south/west facing lounge with small balcony with far reaching views to the sea. Kitchen and bathroom with shower over bath and one double bedroom. Further benefiting from having modern electric heating and double glazing, telephone entry system, lift to all floors, communal sky dish and white goods. With regret no pets and no children â€“ Â£685 rental is payable calendar monthly in advance.\n\nFor many years, a gentleman called Todd Sweeney collected sunshine statistics from the roof of Fitzleet House, which were then forwarded to the Met Office in London to assist with national statistics, and in 1983 one group of Cubs arranged a special tea party on the roof of the building as part of the national tea-making fortnight.\n\nBognor Regis Post\n\nHighlight of the day or any day for that matter the Health Centre.\n\nPaul English Conservative Felpham East â€“ asked about the life span of the building given it was built in the 1960s, describing it as â€˜incredibly oldâ€™.\n\nMr Clavell-Bate replied â€“ NHS Property Services say it is structurally sound, it has a life expectancy going forward.\n\nBognor Regis Observer\n\nI was looking forward to going forward Wetherspoonâ€™s â€“ ideologically unsound going forward, with hindsight.\n\nLetâ€™s take a last late night stroll along the promenade.\n\nNight night.\n\nCouncil House former Civic Centre â€“ Armada Way Plymouth PL1 2AA\n\nFormer Civic Centre 1958-62 by Jellicoe, Ballantyne and Coleridge with city architect HJW Stirling. In-situ concrete structure with pre-cast aggregate panels. It comprises a fourteen storey slab block on a raised raft foundation which straddles a two storey block to the north and a bridge link to the two storey Council House to the south. The bridge link is elevated on pilotis to create an open courtyard with a reflecting pond, part of the designed landscape of the civic square.\n\nCurrent listing June 10th 2007 Historic England\n\nI rode into town on my bicycle en route from Weston super Mare to Hastings one sunny afternoon in 2015. The pictures I took that day were largely left untouched, until today. I was prompted by an online postcard search to finally put them to some good use.\n\nOn the day of my visit the building was well and truly closed, and its future uncertain.\n\nI took my time and explored the site, here is what I saw:\n\nI subsequently found archival image of the interior â€“ including examples of applied decorative arts.\n\nThe building has suffered of late, from poor maintenance and general neglect.\n\nLove it or hate it, itâ€™s one of Plymouthâ€™s most iconic post-war buildings â€“ and it towers over the city centre. But the Civic Centre has been empty since 2015, with sad images revealing parts of the outside literally crumbling.\n\nToday is the day Plymouth will finally discover what developer Urban Splash plans to do with the landmark 14-storey tower block it bought for Â£1.\n\nPlymouth Herald\n\nUrban Splash are in the house â€“ plans are to go ahead.\n\nThe proposal, by Gillespie Yunnie Architects, will see the 14-storey former council headquarters converted into 144 one and two-bedroom flats with the ground floors of the lower blocks providing about 4,600mÂ² of office, retail and leisure space.\n\nUnanimously approved last week, the scheme will open up the ground floor, making it â€˜an active public space filled with outside seating for cafÃ©s, bars and restaurantsâ€™ and reuse the existing landscaped pools, while creating new pedestrian connections through the scheme from the Theatre Royal and Civic Square.\n\nArchitects Journal\n\nIâ€™m more than partial to a picture postcard â€“ I have penchant for the picaresque.\n\nAnd in these troubled times thereâ€™s no safer way to travel.\n\nI have some previous experience, exploring the precincts of our fair land â€“ here and there.\n\nPrompted by a post from Natalie Bradbury â€“ I became intrigued by Newcastle Civic Centre cards, I have visited the site, but in this instance, we are taken there thus:\n\nLetâ€™s have a look inside:\n\nThe Council Chamber\n\nGrand Entrance Hall\n\nIts extensive rooms.\n\nWhich then led me to Plymouth â€“ which I had visited some time ago, on my coastal cycle tour, another fine example of post-war Municipal Modernism.\n\nEmpty for some time it now seems that a change is going to come:\n\nA long-awaited scheme to convert the empty Civic Centre tower block in Plymouth into flats is set to be given the go-ahead.\n\nPlanning applications to create 144 homes in the 14-floor landmark building in Armada Way are being recommended for approval.\n\nThe scheme also proposes a mix of uses for the ground and first floors including shops, offices, cafes and restaurants, bars, hot food takeaway, art gallery, gym, creche and day nursery.\n\nPlymouth Herald\n\nMany of our fine Modernist civic buildings are under threat â€“ as councils seek new premises for a new age.\n\nOnly the strong survive.\n\nOn the night of 14 November 1940, the city of Coventry was devastated by bombs dropped by the Luftwaffe. The Cathedral burned with the city, having been hit by several incendiary devices.\n\nThe decision to rebuild the cathedral was taken the morning after its destruction. Rebuilding would not be an act of defiance, but rather a sign of faith, trust and hope for the future of the world. It was the vision of the Provost at the time, Richard Howard, which led the people of Coventry away from feelings of bitterness and hatred. This has led to the cathedralâ€™s Ministry of Peace and Reconciliation, which has provided spiritual and practical support, in areas of conflict throughout the world.\n\nHer Majesty the Queen laid the foundation stone on 23 March 1956 and the building was consecrated on 25 May 1962, in her presence. The ruins remain hallowed ground and together the two create one living Cathedral.\n\nRalph Beyer carving the foundation stone for Coventry Cathedral.\n\nÂ© Historic England Archive, John Laing Photographic Collection.\n\nCoventry Cathderal\n\nThe new Cathedral was itself an inspiration to many fine artists of the post-war era. The architect, Sir Basil Spence, commissioned work from Graham Sutherland, John Piper, Ralph Beyer, John Hutton, Jacob Epstein, Elisabeth Frink and others â€“ most still to reach the peak of their artistic careers.\n\nSt. Michael and the Devil on the southern end of the east wall. It was sculpted by Sir Jacob Epstein, who, sadly, died in 1959, and therefore didnâ€™t live to see his masterpiece mounted on the cathedral wall a year later.\n\nEntrance to the cathedral is through the Screen of Saints and Angels â€“ it is seventy feet high and forty five feet wide and is supported by a bronze framework hung by wires from the roof for added strength.\n\nThis unique screen formed part of Sir Basil Spenceâ€™s first vision for the new cathedral. As he stared out from the ruins of the bombed cathedral, he saw the shape for the new church through a screen of saints. This transparent wall would link the old and new â€“ making each mutually visible from within each other. Provost Howard set out to draw up a scheme consisting of all the saints who were responsible for the bringing of Christianity to Britain. As John Hutton began to make initial designs, he soon realised that row upon row of saints would need to be broken up in some way, and suggested that angels be inserted between the saints.\n\nThe eighty one foot high Baptistery Window containing a total of one hundred and ninety five lights of stained glass in bright primary colours designed by John Piper and Patrick Reyntiens, with the Stone of Bethlehem for a font just in front. Each individual window contains an abstract design, but the overall effect is breathtaking. Basil Spence himself designed the stone containing the glass.\n\nStudy for the the seventy two foot high tapestry designed by Graham Sutherland â€“ collection of The Herbert Art Gallery\n\nThe great tapestry was another example of a re-think in design. Basil Spenceâ€™s original intention was to depict the Crucifixion but Provost Howard suggested that the subject be Christ in Majesty and from there on, this idea prevailed\n\nAltar cross and crown of thorns by Geoffrey Clarke, large ceramic candlesticks by Hans Coper.\n\nChairs by Russell Hodgson and Leigh.\n\nThe Chapel of Christ in Gethsemane is approached by following the aisle from the Baptistery window towards the altar which is at the north end. The mosaic depicts the Angel of Agony by Steven Sykes and becomes more impressive when seen from a distance through the wrought iron crown of thorns designed by Basil Spence.\n\nA short passageway takes you through to the Chapel of Christ the Servant â€“ also known as the Chapel of Industry due to the view of Coventry workplaces from its narrow windows.\n\nMonumental inscriptions to walls and floor by Ralph Beyer\n\nStained glass to aisle walls by Lawrence Lee, Geoffrey Clarke and Keith New.\n\nAt the far end of the aisle, opposite the Baptistery Window is the Chapel of Unity, with its detailed mosaic floor, donated by the people of Sweden, representing the nations of the world and lit by shafts of light from the narrow stained glass windows around the circumference of the star shaped chapel.\n\nThis design was Basil Spenceâ€™s vision of a chapel representing the star which began the story of Christ â€“ from the outside it appears shaped similarly to a Crusaderâ€™s tent.\n\nThe chapel is intended for prayer by all denominations, not just Anglican, and for this reason was purposely built with no view of the great altar.\n\nHistoric Coventry"
