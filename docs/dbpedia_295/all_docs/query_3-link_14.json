        "text": "I have the rare opportunity this winter to work on a historically significant engine and thought it may be of interest to some to post the work that will be done in our shop. It is a reproduction of the very first prototype Daimler engine built in 1883. The reproduction was built many years ago by the Daimler Corporation and is owned by Tom Stockton of Ann Arbor, Michigan. It was a reasonably close representation of the original engine however it had a few shortcoming and did not operate very well. The carburetion and hot tube torch arrangement need the most work to fix the operational issues. The purpose of this exercise is to finish with a completely functioning engine that will represent the original as close as possible with information available to us. At the conclusion of this project it will be displayed in running condition at the Coolspring Power Museum. Key players in this will be Woody Sins of New Hartford, NY ( research and design work of functioning historically correct flash carburetor ), Myself and Tom Stockton Jr (for guidance and direction ).\n\nThis research project is a work in progress and have learned that specific information on the original prototype is exceedingly difficult to come by. I encourage anyone with specific details to chime in and share what they have.\n\nThe original prototype engine was in the possession of Daimler until 1903 when it was destroyed in a fire. There are currently three reproductions that I am aware of. One at the Mercedes Benz Museum, one at Daimler's workshop and the one we are preparing for the Coolspring Museum.\n\nHere is the only photo of the original I have been able to locate.\n\nThe great significance of this engine was it ability to operate at \" high speed\" ( not limited to the 250 RPM cap of a flame ignition slide valve engine), the first successful engine with a hot tube and it's extremely light weight design. Daimler understood the benefits of higher speed operation and proved it with this design. He has been credited as the inventor of the modern 4 cycle high speed engine.\n\nThe next photos are of the Daimler built reproduction in our shop\n\nWork on this engine will be casual with developments posted as they occurs.\n\nAs previously mentioned one of the areas of interest will be carburetion. Daimler (intentionally ?) did not make the flash carburetor on their reproduction functional. Close examination of its internal components and passageways confirm that key design criterias were omitted. The reasoning for this can only be assumed, maybe they did not want the liability of a functioning flash carburetor in the hands of a novice or possibly details of the internal arrangement were not understood.\n\nDaimler has in their archives videos that show brief clips of this reproduction engine in operation. It is unclear if it is actually operating as a fueled running engine or being spun by an external means. It almost appears that the engine was set up as a movie prop and never really functioned as it was designed. These are live on Youtube and I can post if any would like to see\n\nAttached are a couple photos of the reproduction flash carburetor and its internals.\n\nThe right component is the top section with a mock-up fuel tank for the hot tube burner ( note: all three reproduction engines were built with self contained reproduction torches) The top hut tube burner fuel tank was not needed and non functional. The smaller diameter section of the top section is the flame arrestor. This section should contain a tight wire mesh ( which is missing) to prevent flash backs from entering the carburetor. Also this section should have the air inlet to the carburetor - it is missing.\n\nThe Middle section in the photo is the fuel \"tank\" .\n\nThe left component is a floating atomizer. It floats on the fuel and intake air is bubbled through a series of holes drilled in an area just below the fuel level.\n\nHere is a Daimler Patent that typifies the carburation design used in their early engines\n\nAnother area that needs to be researched and investigated is the hot tube burner assembly. Daimler decided to use a vintage self contained European \"Max Sievert\" on their reproduction. Although an original was obviously not available, Daimler went through the huge exercise of making one from scratch. Examination of historical documentation and photos bring us to the conclusion that the original 1883 engine was never outfitted with a stand along hot tube burner. More of this to follow.\n\nOf interest I found an original vintage \"Max Sievert\" spherical torch on Ebay. I have never seen one in my life but took advantage of this rare opportunity and bought it, just in case it might be correct.\n\nHere are two photos here of the Daimler reproduced hot tube burner arrangement on the reproduction engine.\n\nA note to collectors: I have located some incredibly rare engine components this year using the Internet and have learned to take full advantage of these new resources. Good, very hard to locate parts are still out there. Be patient and be vigilant, they will show up!\n\nHere you can see the hot tube under the heat shield and the repro torch assembly\n\nHere are two photos of an original torch assembly I was lucky enough to get on Ebay recently. Although I do not believe it to be correct we now have an original to use should it be determined to be original equipment.\n\nLast evening Woody Sins and myself were able to do a series of operational tests on the engine. We figured this step would be needed to develop a better understanding of the engine and it operation.\n\nAs mentioned in a previous entry the fuel system has some issues Mainly in the flash carburetor. When Daimler built this particular reproduction they chose to leave out features which made the air flow through the carb virtually useless. One of the steps in our \"re-presentation\" of this engine is to build a new flash carburetor from scratch using original drawings and museum pieces as a guide. Since the as built fuel system for this engine is not functional we went to the parts bin and put together a simple apparatus that allows us to at least run it for a brief period of time.\n\nThe very first thing we did was to see if the reproduction hot tube burner torch functioned. It is made differently than other I am familiar with, This unit pressurizes itself by boiling the gasoline in the sphere by absorbed heat from the burner. The whole thing kind seemed kind of scary to both of us.\n\nHere you can see the burner in operation with a large bright yellow flame, We were unable to get a consistent blue flame from it but thought it may be hot enough to try it on the engine,\n\n1st step was a success. Next was to do a few test runs on the engine. The first test we used a bunsen burner on the hot tube and connected a Lunkenheimer 3/4\" updraft carb to the intake of the engine. After several minutes of finagling and adjustments, we were able to get it to run for a couple seconds at a time. 1st test was sort of a success.\n\nOur 2nd test used the same fuel source and incorporated the \"cherry bomb\" gasoline blow torch. After applying some of the learning's from the 1st test run we were able to get it to start and stay running for a couple minutes. Of course we had video running the whole time to capture the moment. Here you can see us bringing it to life for the second time. It took a few minutes of flipping it through and making some fuel adjustments. In the beginning of the video gasoline is poured into a pre-heating tray attached to the front of the torch's fuel tank. It is then lit and after a minute or two heat is transferred into the fuel where vaporization ( boiling ) starts to occur. Once that happens the vapor leaving the outlet nozzle ignites. The whole process leaves me a bit unnerved.\n\nOur third test we piped propane into the Carb and continued using the blow torch. Here you can see the result. It took a little bit to get the fuel mixture correct - as our fuel delivery system was a bit \"Rube Goldburg\" You can even see the gasoline in the clear fuel tubing from the previous test run.\n\nIt was an interesting evening of experimenting and playing in the shop.\n\nThe engine never had a cooling system, as it was strictly designed as a test mule. The test runs we did only lasted a few minutes each with a 1/2 hour cool down time in between.\n\nWoody and I both wondered when the last time an early Daimler engine ran. The spiral groove cam is quite a thing to see in operation.\n\nWayne T, Thanks for posting the pictures of the Repro at Stuttgart. That engine is probably built the best of the three that exist. There are subtle but significant differences between them all - Mostly in the fuel delivery and vaporizing system. Also of note if you look closely at the original photo in my first post you will see an inner track in the spiral cam groove that is completely circular. When the engine is spun backwards, the tooth that follows the track kicks out and stays in the center track. The only repro that has this feature is the Stuttgart example. I do not have any explanation why this feature was left out of the other two.\n\nNick, You asked earlier about the age of the reproductions. The one at Cannstatt Germany and the other in the Daimler museum were both made a long time ago however I can not give you a specific date. The Engine I am working on for the Coolspring exhibit was made in the 1980's for Tom Stockton Sr.. I believe the people at Daimler who made this particular one did not understand its operation correctly and missed a few details. I have been in communication with several people at Daimler who have access to the historical archives. It is disappointing they have not been able to come up with any significant information as of yet."
