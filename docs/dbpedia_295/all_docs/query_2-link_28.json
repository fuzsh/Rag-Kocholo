Freisleben, R Jackson, E Saunders, Edward Bawden, Barnett Freedman, Nicholas Bently and many others is included in the collection. The Archive includes records for Shell-Mex and BP, Anglo-Persian Oil Company, Royal Dutch-Shell, Power Petroleum Company, Dominion Motor Company ,and National Benzole Company products.\n\nShell-Mex and BP Limited (SMBP) was formed in 1932 when the Anglo-Persian Oil Company (APOC, now BP) and Royal Dutch-Shell decided to merge their United Kingdom marketing operations. APOC held 40 per cent and Shell 60 per cent ownership, reflecting their respective market shares. SMBP acquired the Power Petroleum Company and the Dominion Motor Company in 1934, and the National Benzole Company in 1957. Each brand continued to be marketed separately throughout the existence of the joint company. The parent organisations de-merged their United Kingdom marketing operations in 1976.\n\nReference: GB 1566 SMBP\n\nThe BP Archive is open to 1954, access to post-1954 materials held in the BP Archive at this time is not available.
