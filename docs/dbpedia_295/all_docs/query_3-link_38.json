        "text": "Post by Bernie on\n\nAs part of a new effort for more consistent article quality on the wiki, we're going to begin attempting to fix articles up per request. Post any articles you feel need to be rewritten, revised, or reformatted. For tips on revising them yourself, see \"Key Traits to a Good Article\". There are plans to reward users who help revise articles, but it might be a while until such a system is implemented.\n\nIdentifying Poorly-Written Articles\n\nFirst of all, make sure to read through the Wiki's article guidelines to identify what constitutes as a 'poorly-written' article. Here's an excerpt for the lazy :\n\nPlagiarism will not be tolerated and will ultimately result in a ban for repeat offenders; the entire article must be your own, though direct quotes are acceptable (so long as they don't comprise the majority of the article's content).\n\nArticles must be of a competent level of quality, with correct punctuation, spelling, paragraphing, etc.\n\nPieces of lost media are only eligible for an article if they are relevant enough to warrant one, ie. they must be relatively known amongst the general public; if unsure of a potential article's eligibility, please contact a staff member.\n\nNew articles for pieces of media that have already been found are allowed on a case-by-case basis, as the media in question must have been known about and considered lost for a significant period of time before it was found; if unsure of a potential article's eligibility, please contact a staff member.\n\nThese 4 rules will be good for just identifying ineligible articles (though it's still suggested to read through the whole thing). If you have found one, but are unable / unsure how to rewrite it, please post it in this thread and it will be added to the list at the bottom.\n\nAdding the 'Needing Work' tags\n\nOnce you've identified a bad article, be sure to tag it as 'Needing Work'. This way, it'll be easier to find and organize at first glance. Note that this is not necessary if you're editing it before submitting. All of the old code has been condensed into an easy template, so to mark an article as needing work, add the following to the top of the page:\n\n{{NeedingWork|heavy plagiarism}}\n\nThe 'heavy plagiarism' can be changed for any number of reasons, like 'lack of content'. For custom alphabetization in listings, as with article titles that start with the word \"the\", you can add a sortkey to the end of it like this:\n\n{{NeedingWork|lack of content|Boondocks, The}}\n\nKey traits to a good article\n\nThese few traits are what we'd like you to focus on when you begin revising articles. More will be added as time goes on\n\n1. Infoboxes\n\nInfoboxes are one of the key traits of the wiki format. I've noticed a large number of articles lacking them, which I'm not sure is the reason to. If you notice an article lacking an infobox, please add it to the page. Here is the template:\n\n{{InfoboxLost\n\n|title=<center>Title of the Article</center>\n\n|image=Template.png\n\n|imagecaption=Image Caption.\n\n|status=<span style=\"color:orange/red/green;\">'''Status (ex: Found, Lost, Partially Lost)'''</span>\n\n}}\n\n2. Formatting\n\nOne of the largest issues is formatting articles to be of consistent quality. This means using headers, table of contents, and properly embedding images. Here are two examples: [1] [2]\n\nSome shorter articles, or 'stubs', do not have enough information to warrant using headers. Use your best judgement on what makes the article easier to read and navigate.\n\n3. Eligibility\n\nThere are many articles that are simply ineligible for the site. This includes obscure but not lost pieces of media. If you are unsure of an article's eligibility for the site (i.e not truly being lost, non-important dubs, etc) post the article and a description of why you feel it may be ineligible.\n\nSubmitting Articles to the Thread\n\nThere will be two kinds of submissions in this thread: articles that need to be fixed, and articles that have been fixed. Here's a template that will hopefully help make the process easier:\n\nArticle Name:\n\nEdited?: (Yes) (No)\n\nCategories:\n\nSummary:\n\nLink:\n\nAnd here's an example of it's usage.\n\nArticle Name: A Day With SpongeBob SquarePants\n\nEdited?: (Yes) (No)\n\nCategories: Lost Animation\n\nSummary: Formatting\n\nLink: lostmediawiki.com/A_Day_With_SpongeBob_SquarePants:_The_Movie_(Unproduced_Direct-To-DVD_Movie;_2011)\n\nArticles needing to be revised:\n\nSee also: lostmediawiki.com/Special:SpecialPages & lostmediawiki.com/Category:Needing_work\n\n1\n\n101% Spooky Whizbang! with Henry and June (partially found Nickelodeon Halloween block; 1999)\n\n2\n\n28th Dove Awards: Bob and Larry Segments (partially found footage from award show; 1997)\n\nA\n\nA (found animated short film; 1965)\n\nA Magic School Bus Halloween (found live-action/animated special of TV series; 1995)\n\n\"A Nightmare On My Street\" (found DJ Jazzy Jeff & The Fresh Prince music video; 1988)\n\nA Son Unique (found unreleased Ol' Dirty Bastard album; date unknown)\n\nA Tribute to Walt Disney (lost Lawrence Welk Show episode; 1970)\n\nA-ha \"Take On Me\" (partially found instrumental demo of song; 1983)\n\nThe Adventures of Super Mario Bros. 3 \"Mind Your Mummy Mommy\" - \"Wipeout\" cover version (lost original audio of animated series episode; 1990)\n\nAfterMASH \"Wet Feet\" (found final episode of \"M*A*S*H\" spinoff series; mid 1980s)\n\nAlex Turner - Suck It And See (unreleased Submarine soundtrack version; 2010)\n\nAll American Massacre (partially found unreleased Texas Chainsaw Massacre spin-off film; 1998-2000)\n\nAll in the Family \"And Justice For All\" & \"Those Were The Days\" (found pilots of sitcom TV series; 1968-1969)\n\nAmadís de Gaula (lost chapters of chivalric romance books; 14th century)\n\nThe Angry Beavers \"Cuffed Together\" (rumoured lost pilot episode of animated series; existence unconfirmed; early-mid 1990s)\n\nAnimation Nation (found BBC4 documentary series; 2005)\n\nAnthony Fantano/The Needle Drop \"prank\" clips (partially found YouTube videos; 2010s)\n\nArcade Fire - \"Where the Wild Things Are'' soundtrack (lost tracks of film; existence unconfirmed; 2009)\n\nAurora productions: The Gai Podcast (found episodes of podcast series; 2017)\n\nAustralia's Naughtiest Home Videos (found cancelled mid-aired TV special; 1992)\n\nB\n\nB-Robo Kabutack (found \"Metal Hero\" TV series; 1997-1998)\n\nBar Rescue \"Music City Mess\" (found episode of reality TV show; 2013)\n\nBarbie Dance Club \"Duane's Theme\" (found song from promotional VHS tape; 1989)\n\nBarbie: Life in the Dreamhouse \"Malibu's Empirical Emporium\" (found original English audio of episode of animated series; 2014)\n\nThe Baskervilles (partially found animated series; 2000)\n\nBattle of Britain (found original William Walton score of war film; 1969)\n\nThe Battlefields of Napoleon (cancelled English localization of \"Napoleon Senki\" Famicom game; 1988)\n\nBBC Digital 'Faces' promotion (partially lost BBC One/Two advertising material; 2005)\n\nBeach House 'Teen Dream' music videos (lost rejected productions; 2010)\n\nBear in the Big Blue House (lost unaired pilot of Disney puppet TV series; 1997)\n\nThe Beatles \"Now and Then\" (lost overdub session of song; 1995)\n\nBeatmania DA!!
