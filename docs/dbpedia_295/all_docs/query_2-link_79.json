        "text": "From soil samples of different origin (field, grassland and forest soils) small numbers ofNocardin andPseudomonas spec., able to utilize benzene and phenol could be isolated. Organisms which could only utilize phenol and phenolcarboxylic acids were more numerous and consisted mainly ofArthrobacter spec. It was tested to what extent these organisms could also utilize chlorinated aromatic and cyclohexane derivatives. For the degradation studies the bacteria were precultivated on benzene or p-hydroxybenzoic acid and then the compounds used were added. These compounds were labeled by14C and their degradation rates determined by measuring the14CO2 release.Pseudomonas andNocardia spec. precultivated on benzene could also degrade the chlorinated derivatives of benzene and phenol. The monochlorinated derivates were degraded more easily than the di- and trichlorinated derivates. The chlorinated benzenes, especially in higher concentrations, were less degraded than the chlorinated phenols, but with lower concentrations their degradation rates were about similar. This was due to a higher toxicity of the benzenes. The phenol utilizingArthrobacter spec. were only able to degrade phenol and the chlorinated phenols. Benzoic and m-chlorobenzoic acid were degraded to CO2 by thePseudomonas andNocardia spec. only. The benzene utilizing pseudomonads released more CO2 from γ-pentachlorocyclohexane than from γ-hexachlorocyclohexane, but none from cyclehexane. Upon precultivation of benzene utilizing pseudomonads in glucose, the aromatic compounds were also degraded, but especially the chlorinated derivatives to a lower extent.\n\nIn comparison with these soil organisms in pure culture, experiments with soil samples showed a degradation of all compounds which were used by the isolated organisms after variable induction periods. Cyclohexane was degraded slowly to CO2 by the mixed soil flora in contrast to the benzene or phenol utilizing pure cultures."
