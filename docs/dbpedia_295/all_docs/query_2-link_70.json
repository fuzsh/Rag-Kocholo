        "text": "INFORMATION FOR BUYERS AT ONLINE AUCTIONS\n\nIntroduction. The following notes are intended to assist bidders and buyers, particularly those that are inexperienced or new to our online saleroom. All of our online auctions are governed by our Conditions of Business for Online Auctions incorporating the Terms of Consignment for Online Auctions (primarily applicable to sellers), the Terms of Sale for Online Auctions (primarily applicable to bidders and buyers) and any notices that are displayed on any listing for a lot in our online auction catalogue. Our Conditions of Business for Online Auctions are available for inspection on our website at www.1818auctioneers.co.uk and you will be asked to confirm your agreement to these terms before you will be able to place a bid in our online auctions. Please contact us if there is anything in our Conditions of Business for Online Auctions that you do not fully understand.\n\nPlease make sure that you read our Terms of Sale for Online Auctions on our website carefully before bidding in any online auction. If your bid is successful, you will be obliged to comply with our Terms of Sale for Online Auctions.\n\nAgency. As auctioneers we usually act on behalf of the seller whose identity, for reasons of confidentiality, is not normally disclosed. If, however, the seller is a trader, we will disclose the identity of the seller and the seller’s business address to you on the listing for the relevant lot in our online auction catalogue. If you buy at auction your contract for your purchase of the goods is with the seller, not with us as auctioneer.\n\nEstimates. Estimates are designed to help you gauge what sort of sum might be involved for the purchase of a particular lot. Estimates may change and should not be thought of as the sale price. The lower estimate may represent the reserve price (the minimum price for which a lot may be sold) and will not be below the reserve price. Estimates do not include the buyer’s premium or VAT (where chargeable). Estimates are prepared some time before the auction and may be altered on the listing for a lot in our online auction catalogue before the auction of the lot. They are not definitive.\n\nBuyer's Premium. The Terms of Sale for Online Auctions oblige you to pay a buyer's premium at 22.5% on the hammer price of each lot purchased. VAT is included in this premium (see below).\n\nIn addition, there is also a 3.5% + VAT web fee applicable on all lots purchased, via the-saleroom.com, 1818 Auctioneers website or by absentee bid.\n\nVAT. Clauses 6, 7 and 8 are intended to give general guidance on VAT for items purchased at auction. We have covered the common situations, and this may not be comprehensive. We are unable to offer tax advice and we suggest you seek independent advice if you require clarifications or further information.\n\n6.1. VAT. Items in our catalogue may be marked in the following ways:\n\n(a) (*) indicates that VAT is payable by the buyer on both the hammer price and the buyer's premium. VAT will be chargeable at the standard rate (presently 20%) for most lots. Qualifying books will be charged at 0%. This imposition of VAT is likely to be because the seller is registered for VAT within the UK and is not operating the Dealers Margin Scheme on their consignment to us.\n\n(b) (**) indicates that the lot has been imported from outside the UK using customs Temporary Admissions procedures. Import VAT of 5% (reduced rate due to nature of the lot) is due on the hammer price and an amount in lieu of VAT at 20% will be included in the buyer’s premium. This VAT on the buyer’s premium cannot be itemised separately on our invoices. The successful bidder and therefore buyer of the lot will become the importer.\n\n(c) (!) indicates that the lot has been imported from outside the UK using customs Temporary Admissions procedures. Import VAT of 20% (higher rate) is due on the hammer price and an amount in lieu of VAT at 20% will be included in the buyer’s premium. This VAT on the buyer’s premium cannot be itemised separately on our invoices. The successful bidder and therefore buyer of the lot will become the importer.\n\n(d) Lots which do not display one of the above symbols (referred to herein as unmarked lots) have no VAT payable on the hammer price. This is because such lots are sold using the Auctioneers' Margin Scheme. Therefore, an amount in lieu of VAT at the standard rate is included within the premium and will not be shown separately on our invoice or be recoverable as input tax.\n\n6.2. For the items marked (**) or (!), buyers registered for VAT in the UK should notify us as soon as possible after the sale so that we can correctly instruct our shipping agents to complete the import into the UK under the buyer’s VAT registration and HMRC can issue a form C79. The charge on our invoice for the import VAT is not sufficient evidence to make a claim for the import VAT.\n\nRefunds of VAT\n\n7.1. For buyers from outside the UK, the VAT charged on the hammer price and buyer’s premium or included in lieu of VAT in the buyer’s premium can be refunded so long as the buyer has:\n\n(a) registered to bid with an address outside the UK; and\n\n(b) discussed with us the proof of export we require and the timeframes to complete the export.\n\n7.2. Once we are satisfied that the requirements referred to in Clause 6.1 have been met, and with the proof of export provided, the following VAT will be refunded:\n\n(a) For lots marked (*): the VAT on the hammer price and on the buyer’s premium.\n\n(b) For lots marked (**) and (!): the import VAT and, for non-UK business customers only, the VAT in lieu in the buyer’s premium.\n\n(c) For unmarked lots: the VAT in lieu in the buyer’s premium.\n\n7.3. To enable us to refund the VAT charged correctly we normally require the use of our international shippers to assist with the required paperwork. For private buyers, we will only be able to refund the VAT if our shippers are used for the export of the lot outside the UK.\n\nReinvoicing Sales. For unmarked lots, you can request a lot to be reinvoiced outside the Auctioneers’ Margin Scheme. VAT at 20% will be charged on the hammer price and the VAT on the buyer’s premium will be itemised separately on our invoice. This will enable a VAT registered business to reclaim all the VAT. Please note that the item will no longer be eligible to be sold in the Margin Scheme. We recommend you seek advice before proceeding. Requests must be made within 12 Months of the sale and certain conditions apply.\n\nGoods with electrical components. These are sold as “antiques” for their historical and decorative attributes and for collection and display only. They are not intended for use. If you buy goods with electrical components and intend to use them, you must ask a qualified electrician to check them for compliance with safety regulations before you use them.\n\nEndangered species. If you intend to buy goods which contain endangered species, you need to find out if there is a prohibition on the purchase of goods of that character. For goods containing elephant ivory, you also need to satisfy yourself that they have been correctly registered or certified and meet the exemption conditions under applicable legislation.\n\nExport of goods. If you intend to export goods you must find out:\n\n(a) whether an export licence is needed; and\n\n(b) if there is a prohibition on exporting goods of that character outside of the UK or on importing goods of that character in your intended country of import e.g. because the goods contain prohibited materials such as elephant ivory or other protected flora and fauna.\n\nBidding. Bidders will be required to register with us before the online auction starts. We reserve the right to impose a deadline prior to the auction by which you must register. If you wish to bid on high value lots this deadline may be several days before the auction in order to allow us sufficient time to carry out the necessary checks. Lots will be invoiced to the name and address on the registration form. You will need to provide us with proof of your identity in a form acceptable to us and such other information as we may require. Please note that we may refuse to register you if you do not provide us with all the information and documentation that we ask for or at our discretion.\n\nMethods of Payment. Acceptable methods of payment are displayed on our website/online bidding platform.\n\nPotentialCancellation Rights. If you purchase a lot as a consumer in the UK or EU from a seller who is a trader, you may have a right to cancel your purchase of that lot from the day of the auction up to the day which is 14 days after the date on which you take possession of the lot. You may also have the right to cancel the auction-related services provided by us. Further information is set out in the Terms of Sale for Online Auctions.\n\nCollection and storage. Please note what the Terms of Sale for Online Auctions say about collection and storage (see Clause 11). It is important that you pay for and collect goods promptly. Any delay may involve you having to pay storage charges.\n\nFinancial Checks. As auctioneers we may have to conduct various checks into our customers under the Money Laundering, Terrorist Financing and Transfer of Funds (Information on the Payer) Regulations 2017 (as amended), under sanctions legislation and other related legislation. Unless we confirm we already have this information, on registration to bid you will be required to provide the following:\n\n(a) For individuals, official photo identification (driving licence, passport or equivalent) and proof of address (if this is not included in your ID document);\n\n(b) For corporate entities, the certificate of incorporation (or equivalent) with the entity’s official name, registered number (if any) and registered address, as well as details and ID documentation for directors and beneficial owners of the entity;\n\n(c) For trusts and estates, details and ID documentation for executors/trustees and details of beneficiaries; please contact us for further information.\n\n16.1. You may be asked for further information if we deem this necessary.\n\n16.2. If you are bidding for another person (your “Principal”) you will be required to provide the above information for yourself and your Principal, along with a signed letter from your Principal authorising you to bid on his/her behalf.\n\n16.3. Further information about ID requirements is available by request at (email) info@1818auctioneers.co.uk. If we deem that you have not provided sufficient information for us to complete our anti-money laundering, terrorist financing and sanctions checks to our satisfaction, we may refuse to register you to bid and we may postpone completion of or cancel any contract made by you and the Seller in the event you have made a successful bid.\n\n(3) TERMS OF CONSIGNMENT FOR ONLINE AUCTIONS\n\nBoth the sale of goods at our online auctions and your relationship with us are governed by the Terms of Consignment for Online Auctions (primarily applicable to sellers), the Terms of Sale for Online Auctions (primarily applicable to bidders and buyers) and, in relation to specific lots, any notices that are displayed in the listing for that lot in our online auction catalogue at the time of the auction (collectively, the “Conditions of Business for Online Auctions”). The Terms of Consignment for Online Auctions and the Terms of Sale for Online Auctions are available on our Website.\n\nPlease read these Terms of Consignment for Online Auctions carefully. Please note that if you (or another person acting on your behalf) provide goods to us to sell on your behalf at our online auction, this signifies that you agree to and will comply with these Terms of Consignment for Online Auctions.\n\nPlease note that these Terms of Consignment for Online Auctions relate to auctions held online only. We have separate terms for auctions held at our premises.\n\n1. Definitions and interpretation\n\nTo make these Terms of Consignment for Online Auctions easier to read, we have given the following words a specific meaning:\n\nIn these Terms of Consignment for Online Auctions the words “you”, “yours”, etc. refer to the Seller. The words “we”, “us”, “our” etc. refer to the Auctioneer. All obligations that apply to the Seller under these Terms of Consignment for Online Auctions shall apply to the owner of the Goods and their agent, jointly and separately. Any reference to a ‘Clause’ is to a clause of these Terms of Consignment for Online Auctions unless stated otherwise.\n\nInformation that we are required to give to Consumers\n\n2.1.

The arrangements for collection of any unsold Goods are set out in Clauses 17 and terms regarding payment of any Proceeds due to you in Clause 16.\n\n2.6.

If you consign Goods to us for sale at online auction, you will need to provide us with the following information about you, in a form acceptable to us:\n\n(a) Your legal name and proof of identity (as set out in Clause 3.3) and other information as we may require to conduct such checks under the Money Laundering Legislation as we deem necessary;\n\n(b) Information about the Goods (as set out in Clause 11);\n\n(c) Your bank account details;\n\n(d) Your address and contact details;\n\n(e) Your VAT registration number (if applicable); and\n\n(f) Your confirmation of whether you are selling the Goods as a Trader or as a Consumer.\n\n3.2. You must provide the Goods to us by any stated deadline (at your expense). We may be able to assist you with this process but any liability incurred to a carrier for haulage charges is solely your responsibility.\n\n3.3. We may have to conduct various checks into our customers under the Money Laundering Legislation. In this regard we will require the following for the consignor of property to us:\n\n(a) For individuals, official photo identification (driving licence, passport or equivalent) and proof of address (if this is not included in your ID document).\n\n(b) For corporate entities, the certificate of incorporation (or equivalent) with the entity’s official name, registered number (if any) and registered address, as well as details and ID documentation for directors and beneficial owners of the entity.\n\n(c) For trusts and estates, details and ID documentation for executors/trustees and details of beneficiaries; for further information please contact us at info@1818auctioneers.co.uk .\n\n3.4. You may be asked for further information if we deem this necessary.\n\n3.5. If you are consigning goods for another person (your Principal) you will be required to provide the above information (as applicable) for yourself and your Principal, along with a signed letter from your Principal authorising you to consign those goods.\n\n3.6. If you are consigning goods on behalf of someone who is not the ultimate owner of the Goods, you will be required to provide us with all information on the ultimate owner(s) of the Goods we may require to satisfy our checks under the Money Laundering Legislation.\n\n3.7. If you do not provide us with the above information by any stated deadline, or we are not satisfied with any information received from you, we may refuse to accept consignment of your Goods for sale in our auction and we may postpone or cancel the contract for sale between you and a successful bidder.\n\n3.8. We reserve the right, in our discretion, to reveal your identity and contact details (or that of your Principal) to the Buyer, for regulatory purposes.\n\nThe contract between you and the Buyer\n\n4.1. We will confirm acceptance of a successful bid for the Goods to the Buyer by sending the Buyer an order confirmation by e-mail (the “Order Confirmation”). The contract between you and the Buyer will be formed when we send the Buyer the Order Confirmation.\n\n4.2. You may directly enforce any terms in the Terms of Sale for Online Auctions against a Buyer and/or a Bidder to the extent that you have suffered damages and/or loss as a result of the Buyer and/or the Bidder’s breach of the Terms of Sale for Online Auctions.\n\n4.3. If you breach these Terms of Consignment for Online Auctions, you may be responsible for damages and/or losses suffered by a Buyer, Bidder and/or by us. If we are contacted by a Buyer and/or a Bidder who wishes to bring a claim against you, we may in our discretion provide the Buyer and/or Bidder with information or assistance in relation to that claim.\n\n4.4. If you are a Trader you may not list or sell Goods anonymously. The listing for your Goods must include your name and address.\n\n4.5. We normally act as an agent only and will not have any responsibility for default by you or the Buyer.\n\n4.6. We may delay completion of, or cancel, any contract for sale where (i) we have not completed our enquiries pursuant to the Money Laundering Legislation to our satisfaction, (ii) we have concerns about the Buyer in relation to the Money Laundering Legislation, or (iii) we have reason to believe that the transaction might be unlawful for any reason, or that the sale might put us under any civil or criminal liability.\n\nCommission\n\n5.1. We will charge you a commission on the sale of the Goods calculated as a percentage of the Hammer Price at the following rates:\n\n[18.75% + VAT or 22.5% inclusive of VAT ]\n\n5.2. Our sales are normally conducted under HMRC’s VAT rules for the Auctioneers’ Margin Scheme. Under this scheme we will charge an amount in lieu of VAT at the standard rate on our Commission. This VAT will not be separately itemised on our statement to you and is not reclaimable. For the sale of qualifying books, the rate of VAT will be 0%.\n\nLoss and Damage to Goods\n\n6.1. We are not authorised by the FCA to provide insurance to you. However, subject only to Clauses 6.4 and 6.5, we accept liability for Goods from the time we take possession of the Goods until title passes to the Buyer.\n\n6.2. Our liability for Goods is limited to our lower pre-sale estimate for the lot before the sale, or the Hammer Price if the lot has sold, or to the Reserve if the lot is unsold.\n\n6.3. To justify accepting liability for Goods as set out above, we will charge you 18.75% of the Hammer Price plus VAT.\n\n6.4. You should note that goods are sold as antiques, for their decorative attributes, and are often of considerable age and uncertain manufacture; the liability accepted by us in Clause 6.1 does not include any liability for loss or damage to the Goods that is caused by or results from any inherent vice or defect affecting the Goods, or from (i) acts of God, flood, drought, earthquake or other natural disaster; (ii) acts of terrorism, civil commotion, riots or war; or (iii) nuclear, chemical or biological contamination.\n\n6.5. If you (or your agent) instruct us in writing not to assume liability for Goods, the Goods remain entirely at your risk unless and until the Goods pass to the Buyer or are collected by you or on your behalf. In this case Clauses 6.1 to 6.4 will not apply.\n\nPhotographs\n\n7.1. You will pay for the cost of any photographs of your Goods produced for the online auction catalogue. We reserve the right to photograph all Goods unless you specifically request us not to in writing. The copyright in such photographs will be owned by us, along with the text and layout of the online auction catalogue.\n\nReserves\n\n8.1. Goods will normally be offered subject to a Reserve agreed between you and us before the online auction. Reserves must be reasonable and may not exceed our lower pre-sale estimate for that lot. We may decline to offer Goods which, in our opinion, would be subject to an unreasonably high Reserve (in which case the Goods carry the storage and insurance charges set out in these Terms of Consignment for Online Auctions).\n\n8.2. Once we have agreed a Reserve, this cannot be changed except with your and our consent.\n\n8.3. Where a Reserve has been agreed, only we may bid on your behalf and only up to one bid below the Reserve (if any). You may in no circumstances bid personally on the Goods consigned by you or ask anyone else to bid on your behalf for such Goods.\n\nElectrical items\n\n9.1. You must test any electrical items that you wish to consign to us for sale using external contractors. We will not accept any Goods that are not certified as safe by an electrician, unless they are antiques.\n\n9.2. If we notify you that we will not accept uncertified electrical Goods, you must remove such Goods promptly at your expense following such notification. If you do not collect the Goods within five businessdays of our written notice to do so, we may dispose of the Goods at your expense.\n\nUnsafe Goods\n\n10.1. If in our opinion any of your Goods, in particular those which are soft furnishings, infringe safety regulations, we have the right not to offer these Goods for sale. You must remove such Goods at your expense. If you do not collect such Goods within five business days of our written notice to do so, we may dispose of the Goods at your expense.\n\nWarranties and information about the Goods\n\n11.1. You must provide us with all information that you have relating to the provenance, export/import history, condition, attribution, authenticity and VAT status of the Goods (and any additional information that may be relevant).\n\n11.2. If you are consigning Goods containing or made of elephant ivory, you must provide us with the exemption certificate or proof of registration of the Goods on the relevant government website (or through alternative postal and telephone methods prescribed by the government), as applicable. The exemption certificate (if applicable) shall be passed to the Buyer upon transfer of ownership to the Buyer in accordance with the Terms of Sale.\n\n11.3. In addition to any warranties implied by law, you warrant, and where you are acting on behalf of someone else, you will procure that your Principal warrants, to us and the Buyer that:\n\n(a) any information or documentation that you provide in relation to the Goods is complete, correct and up to date;\n\n(b) the Goods will match any description of the Goods that you provide to us;\n\n(c) as far as you are aware, the main characteristics of the Goods set out in the Listing are correct;\n\n(d) the VAT status of the Goods declared by you is correct and that items to be sold under the Auctioneers’ Margin Scheme are eligible to be sold under the Scheme as set out in the current appropriate HMRC VAT notices;\n\n(e) for Goods consigned from outside the UK and to be entered under Temporary Admissions, the following conditions are met: (i) the Goods are not returned goods to the UK, or were Goods previously exported by you from the UK, (ii) ownership in the Goods has not changed whilst they were outside the UK, and (iii) the Goods are eligible for importation into the UK;\n\n(f) to the best of your knowledge, the Goods have been lawfully imported and lawfully and permanently (save for Goods imported in the UK under a Temporary Admissions procedure) exported as required by the laws of any country in which the Goods were located; required declarations upon the export and import of the Goods have been properly made; and any duties and taxes on the export and import of the Goods have been paid (save for Goods imported in the UK under a Temporary Admissions procedure);\n\n(g) neither you, nor any agent acting for you, nor your Principal, are to the best of your knowledge either under investigation, nor have been charged with nor convicted of tax evasion, money laundering, terrorist financing or other criminal activities;\n\n(h) neither you, nor any agent acting for you, nor your Principal, are subject to Restrictive Measures or owned, partly owned or controlled by person(s) subject to such Restrictive Measures, and to the best of your knowledge the Goods have not been or are not used by or for the benefit of any person(s) subject to Restrictive Measures;\n\n(i) neither (i) your consignment of the Goods, nor (ii) your sale of the Goods to the Buyer, nor (iii) our, or where applicable the Buyer’s, receipt of the Goods does or will violate the laws or regulations (including Restrictive Measures) of any country in which we, you or the Buyer operate;\n\n(j) you will pay all taxes and duties potentially due on the sale of the Goods; and\n\n(k) the Goods are not connected with any criminal activity including tax evasion.\n\n11.4. Where you are acting on behalf of another person and you are an Art Market Participant, you warrant that i) you have conducted appropriate customer due diligence on the ultimate owner(s) of the Goods in accordance with all applicable Money Laundering Legislation; (ii) upon request, you will provide us or any independent third party auditor with any identification and verification data and any other relevant documentation you have obtained for customer due diligence purposes on the ultimate owner(s) of the Goods; (iii) you consent to us relying on this due diligence, and (iv) you will retain for a period of not less than five years the documentation evidencing the due diligence.\n\n11.5. Where you are acting on behalf of another person (your Principal) and you are not an Art Market Participant, you warrant that you will provide accurate and complete information about your Principal to us.\n\n11.6. You must inform us promptly, and in any event before the online auction, if you find out that the warranties in this Clause 11 are incorrect and/or if any of the information or documentation you have provided to us relating to the Goods is incorrect or incomplete and/or if the Goods do not match the description that you provided to us or the main characteristics of the Goods set out in the Listing.\n\n11.7. Any information that you provide in relation to the Goods may form part of the contract between both of us and the Buyer and you acknowledge that the Buyer may have a statutory right to reject the Goods if the information provided is incorrect.\n\n11.8.

Details of this statutory right, and an explanation of how to exercise it, are also provided in the Order Confirmation. This provision does not affect your statutory rights.\n\n12.7. The cancellation right described in this Clause is in addition to any other right that you might have to reject a Lot, for instance because it is a Deliberate Forgery as set out in Clause 18 below.\n\nExercising the consumer’s right to cancel the Contract\n\n13.1. Where you have validly returned a Lot to us under your right of cancellation described in Clause 12, we will refund the full amount paid by you for the Lot.\n\n13.2. Please note that we are permitted by law to reduce your refund to reflect any reduction in the value of the Lot, if this has been caused by your handling of the Lot in a way contrary to the conditions specified in these terms or which would not be permitted during a pre-sale exhibition held prior to an auction. If we refund you the price paid before we are able to inspect the Lot and later discover you have handled the Lot in an unacceptable way, you must pay us an appropriate amount.\n\n13.3. You will be responsible for returning the Lot to us at your own cost.\n\n13.4. We will process any refund due to you within the deadlines below:\n\n13.4.1. if you have collected the Lot but have not returned it to us: fourteen days after the day on which we receive the Lot back from you or, if earlier, the day on which you provide us with evidence that you have sent the Lot back to us; or\n\n13.4.2. if you have not collected the Lot or you have already returned the Lot to us: fourteen days after you inform us of your decision to cancel the Contract.\n\n13.5. We will refund you using the same means of payment that you used for the transaction.\n\n13.6. Legal ownership of a Lot will immediately revert to the Seller if we refund any such payment to you.\n\n13.7. For further information on how to return Lots to us, please get in touch with us using the contact details provided on our Website.\n\nRight to cancel our services\n\n14.1. Separately from your right to cancel your contract with the Seller per Clause 12.1 (where applicable), you will have the statutory right to cancel the contract for the Services we provide you in connection with your purchase of the Lot from the Seller.\n\n14.2. You may cancel the contract for our Services from the day the contract is formed up to the end of the fourteenth day after the date of formation of that contract.\n\n14.3. To cancel the contract for Services, you must inform us of your intention to cancel it. The easiest way to do so is to complete the model cancellation form (Part B) attached to these Terms of Sale for Online Auctions, you can then email it to us at info@1818auctioneers.co.uk. If you send us your cancellation notice by email, then your cancellation is effective from the date you send us the email, if sent within normal working hours. If sent out of normal working hours, then you can assume the cancellation as being effective from 9am the next normal business day. If sending by post please could you call our office to inform us of your intentions and we will treat the cancellation as effective from that point.\n\n14.4. You request that we begin the performance of our Services during the cancellation period. You shall pay us an amount which is in proportion to what has been performed until you have communicated us your cancellation from this contract. You acknowledge that if any of our Services are fully performed by the time the contract for our Services is cancelled, we will not reimburse you for such fully performed Services. For instance, if your contract with us for the provision of our Services starts on 1st January, that you bid successfully on a Lot, pay the Total Amount Due and collect it before the end of your cancellation period, that is, 14th January, we will not reimburse you the Premium, any storage charges, or any other fees paid to us in relation to our services.\n\nRemedies for non-payment or failure to collect purchases\n\n15.1. Please do not bid on a Lot if you do not intend to buy it. If your bid is successful, these Terms of Sale for Online Auctions will form your contract of purchase. This means that you will have to carry out your obligations set out in these Terms of Sale for Online Auctions. Subject to any cancellation of a purchase under Clauses 12 and 13, if you do not comply with these Terms of Sale for Online Auction we may (acting on behalf of the Seller and ourselves) pursue one or more of the following measures:\n\n15.1.1. take action against you for damages for breach of contract;\n\n15.1.2. reverse the sale of the Lot to you and/or any other Lots sold by us to you;\n\n15.1.3. resell the Lot by auction or private treaty (in which case you will have to pay any difference between the price you should have paid for the Lot and the price we sell it for as well as the charges outlined in Clause 11.). Please note that if we sell the Lot for a higher amount than your winning bid, the extra money will belong to the Seller;\n\n15.1.4. remove, store and insure the Lot at your expense;\n\n15.1.5. if you do not pay us within five business days of your successful bid, we may charge interest at a rate not exceeding 2% per month on the total amount due;\n\n15.1.6. keep that Lot or any other Lot sold to you until you pay the Total Amount Due;\n\n15.1.7. reject or ignore bids from you or your agent at future auctions, suspend your ability to place bids on the Bidding Platform and/or impose conditions before we accept bids from you; and/or\n\n15.1.8. if we sell any Lots for you, use the money made on these Lots to repay any amount you owe us.\n\n15.2. We will act reasonably when exercising our rights under Clause 14.1. We will contact you before exercising these rights and try to work with you to correct any non-compliance by you with these Terms of Sale for Online Auctions.\n\nSeller’s Warranties\n\n16.1. The Seller warrants to us and to you that:\n\n16.1.1. the Seller is the true owner of the Lot for sale or is authorised by the true owner to offer and sell the Lot at auction;\n\n16.1.2. the Seller is able to transfer good and marketable title to the Lot to you free from any third party rights or claims; and\n\n16.1.3. as far as the Seller is aware, the main characteristics of the Lot set out in the Listing for the Lot are correct.\n\n16.2. If, after you have placed a successful bid and paid for a Lot, any of the warranties above are found not to be true, please notify us in writing. Neither we nor the Seller will be liable to pay you any sums over and above the Total Amount Due and we will not be responsible for any inaccuracies in the information provided by the Seller except as set out below.\n\n16.3. If you purchase a Lot as a Consumer from a Seller that is a Trader, a number of additional terms may be implied by law in addition to the Seller’s warranties set out at Clause 16.1 (in particular under the Consumer Rights Act 2015). These Terms of Sale for Online Auctions do not seek to exclude your rights under law as they relate to the sale of these Lots.\n\n16.4. Save as expressly set out above, all other warranties, conditions or other terms which might have effect between the Seller and you, or us and you, or be implied or incorporated by statute, common law or otherwise are excluded.\n\nDescriptions, safety, condition and disclaimers\n\n17.1. Our descriptions of the Lot will be based on: (a) information provided to us by the Seller of the Lot (for which we are not liable); and (ii) our opinion (although it is likely that we will not be able to carry out a detailed inspection of each Lot). The actual colour of the Lot may vary from the images in the online auction catalogue.\n\n17.2. Representations or statements by us as to authorship, genuineness, origin, date, age, provenance, condition or estimated selling price involve matters of opinion. We undertake that any such opinion will be honestly and reasonably held and accept liability for opinions given negligently or fraudulently, but not otherwise.\n\n17.3. Please note that many of the Lots that you may bid on at our online auction are second-hand and Lots are unlikely to be in perfect condition. Lots are sold “as is” (i.e. as you see them at the time of the auction). Neither we nor the Seller accept any liability for any condition issues affecting a Lot if such issues are included in the description of the Lot in the Listing or are revealed by any photographs of the Lot appearing on the Listing, or for fitness for purpose of any Lots.\n\n17.4. The sale of Lots containing elephant ivory is banned, subject to exceptions. Please note that we may offer Lots containing elephant ivory from time to time. Where this is the case, we rely on the documentation obtained by the Seller of the Lot confirming that the Lot satisfies the relevant exemptions. Therefore, we cannot guarantee that any certificate or other documentation provided by us (on the Seller’s behalf) to you in connection with the sale of the Lot is valid or accurate.\n\n17.5. All Lots of furniture are sold as a collector’s item and are not supplied for use. Such Lots may not comply with applicable furniture and safety regulations. Therefore, if you do intend to use such Lots for private use or otherwise, you must first ensure that they are refurbished and rendered compliant with any applicable furniture and safety regulations.\n\n17.6. All Lots with electrical components are sold as “antiques” for their historical and decorative attributes for collection and display only, and are not intended for use. If you buy Lots with electrical components and intend to use them, you must first ask a qualified electrician to check them for compliance with safety regulations.\n\nDeliberate Forgeries\n\n18.1. You may return any Lot which you consider with some cause to be a Deliberate Forgery to us within 6 months of the auction provided that you return the Lot to us in the same condition as when it was released to you, accompanied by a written statement identifying the Lot from the relevant online auction catalogue description and a written statement of defects.\n\n18.2. If we are satisfied, acting reasonably, that the Lot is a Deliberate Forgery and returned to us within the period specified in Clause 18.1, we will refund the money paid by you for the Lot (including any Premium and applicable VAT) PROVIDED THAT you will have no right to a refund under this Clause 18.2. if\n\n18.2.1. the online auction catalogue description reflected the accepted view of experts as at the date of the online auction; or\n\n18.2.2. you personally are not able to transfer good and marketable title in the Lot to us.\n\n18.3. If you have sold the Lot to another person, we will only be liable to refund the price that you paid for the Lot. We will not be responsible for repaying any additional money you may have made from selling the Lot. The rights given under this Clause 18 are given to you as Buyer in our online auction; they are not given to, and may not be transferred or assigned to, any other party.\n\n18.4. Your right to return a Lot that is a Deliberate Forgery does not affect your legal rights and is in addition to any other right or remedy provided by law or by these Terms of Sale for Online Auctions.\n\nOur disclaimers and our liability to you\n\n19.1. The Website and the Bidding Platform are provided by us or our service providers without any warranties or guarantees. All users of our Website and/or the Bidding Platform bear the risks associated with the use of the internet.\n\n19.2. Both our Website and the Bidding Platform provide content from users, internet sites or resources. While we try to ensure that material included on our Website and/or the Bidding Platform is correct, reputable and of high quality, we cannot accept responsibility if this is not the case. Except as expressly set out herein, we will not be responsible for any errors or omissions or for the results obtained from the use of such information or for any technical problems users may experience with the Website and/or the Bidding Platform. If we are informed of any inaccuracies in the material on our Website or the Bidding Platform we will attempt to correct the inaccuracies or ask our service providers to do so as soon as we reasonably can.\n\n19.3.

In particular, we will not be liable for any loss of opportunity or disappointment suffered as a result of participating in our online auction.\n\n19.4. You should note that Lots are sold as antiques for their decorative attributes rather than for use, and are often of considerable age and uncertain manufacture; neither we nor the Seller accepts any liability for loss or damage to the Lots, or any other loss or damage, that is caused by or results from any inherent vice or defect affecting the Lots.\n\n19.5. In addition to the above, neither we nor the Seller shall be responsible to you and you shall not be responsible to the Seller or us for any other loss or damage that any of us suffer that is not a foreseeable result of any of us not complying with the Conditions of Business for Online Auctions. Loss or damage is foreseeable if it is obvious that it will happen or if at the time of the sale of the Lot, we, you and the Seller knew it might happen.\n\n19.6. Subject to Clause 19.7, if we are found to be liable to you for any reason (including, amongst others, if we are found to be negligent, in breach of contract or to have made a misrepresentation), our liability will be limited to the total purchase price paid by you to us for any Lot.\n\n19.7. Notwithstanding the above, nothing in these Terms of Sale for Online Auctions shall limit our liability (or that of our employees or agents) for:\n\n19.7.1. death or personal injury resulting from negligence (as defined in the Unfair Contract Terms Act 1977);\n\n19.7.2. fraudulent misrepresentation; or\n\n19.7.3. any liability which cannot be excluded by law.\n\nNotices\n\n20.1.

Any notice or communication given under these Terms of Sale for Online Auctions will not be validly given if sent by fax, any form of messaging via social media or text message (including WhatsApp).\n\nData Protection\n\n21.1.1. We will hold and process any personal data in relation to you in accordance with our current privacy policy, a copy of which is available on our Website/on request.\n\nGeneral\n\n22.1. We may, acting reasonably, refuse to allow you to bid at our online auctions.\n\n22.2. We act as an agent for our Sellers. The rights we have to claim against you for breach of these Terms of Sale for Online Auctions may be used by either us, our employees or agents, or the Seller, its employees or agents, as appropriate.

Delay in exercising or non-exercise of any right under these Terms of Sale for Online Auctions is not a waiver of that or any other right. Partial exercise of any right under these Terms of Sale for Online Auctions will not preclude any further or other exercise of that right or any other right under these Terms of Sale for Online Auctions. Waiver of a breach of any term of these Terms of Sale for Online Auctions will not operate as a waiver of breach of any other term or any subsequent breach of that term.\n\n22.7. These Terms of Sale for Online Auctions and any dispute or claim arising out of or in connection with them (including any non-contractual claims or disputes) shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of England and the parties irrevocably submit to the exclusive jurisdiction of the English courts.\n\nSCHEDULE 1\n\nCANCELLATION FORM PART A\n\n(CANCELLATION OF CONTRACT FOR PURCHASE OF LOT(S))\n\n(Complete and return this form only if you wish to withdraw from the Contract and cancel your purchase of a Lot)\n\nTo 1818 Auctioneers, Junction 36 Rural Auction Centre, Crooklands, Cumbria LA7 7FP, 015395 66201, info@1818auctioneers.co.uk\n\nI/We [*] hereby give notice that I/We [*] cancel my/our [*] contract of sale of the following goods [*]:\n\nAuction Title:\n\nAuction Date:\n\nLot No:\n\nBrief Description of Lot:\n\nBid successfully on [*]/received on [*]:\n\nName of consumer(s):\n\nAddress of consumer(s):\n\nSignature of consumer(s) (only if this form is notified on paper):\n\nDate:\n\n[*] Delete as appropriate\n\nCANCELLATION FORM PART B\n\n(CANCELLATION OF AUCTION SERVICES)\n\n(Complete and return this form only if you wish to withdraw from your contract with the auctioneer and cancel the services provided by the same)\n\nTo 1818 Auctioneers, Junction 36 Rural Auction Centre, Crooklands, Cumbria LA7 7FP, 015395 66201, info@1818auctioneers.co.uk\n\nI/We [*] hereby give notice that I/We [*] cancel my/our [*] contract of sale of the supply of the following service [*]:\n\nDate of registration for the service [*]:\n\nName of consumer(s):\n\nAddress of consumer(s):\n\nSignature of consumer(s) (only if this form is notified on paper):\n\nDate:\n\n[*] Delete as appropriate"
