This iconic franchise gained worldwide recognition through the Hanna-Barbera cartoon series in the 1980s. As the Smurfs soared in popularity, they inspired a vast array of toys and merchandise.\n\nIn 2020, ViacomCBS (now Paramount Global) joined forces with LAFIG Belgium and IMPS to obtain licensing rights for the Smurfs in various territories. This groundbreaking partnership includes plans for the Nickelodeon channel to broadcast the highly anticipated animated Smurfs series produced by IMPS.\n\nThe Fascinating World of Smurf Figurines: A Timeless Hobby\n\nDiscover the fascinating history of Smurf figurines and their enduring popularity. From their humble beginnings in the 1950s to the present day, these collectible treasures have captured the hearts of fans around the world.\n\nIn 1959, Dupuis, the editor of the Smurf comics, introduced the first-ever Smurf figurines. Standing at just 5 centimeters tall, the initial set included Papa Smurf, Normal Smurf, and Angry Smurf. These collectibles were exclusive to French- and Dutch-speaking countries.\n\nThe mass production of Smurf figurines began in 1965, thanks to the German company Schleich. Their PVC collectibles, starting with Normal Smurf, Gold Smurf, and Convict Smurf, quickly gained popularity. Spy Smurf, Angry Smurf, and Drummer Smurf joined the lineup in 1966, followed by Moon Smurf, Winter Smurf, Brainy Smurf, Guitar Smurf, and Papa Smurf in 1969. Competitor Bully, another German company, also produced Smurf figurines in the 1970s, initially as a promotion for Kellogg’s before selling them separately.\n\nSmurfs even made their way into advertising campaigns. Smurfs soon became a favorite promotional tool, with companies like Renault, National Benzole, and BP garages offering them as giveaways with petrol purchases in the UK, South Africa, Australia, and New Zealand. You could collect these prized possessions while filling up your tank!\n\nHowever, in the 1970s, a lead paint scare surrounding Smurf figurines emerged in Britain. This led Jonathan King to release a Christmas single called “Lick a Smurp for Christmas (All Fall)” as a playful response. The scare originated from some smurf figurines that were outsourced to be made in Hong Kong, without adhering to quality standards. To ensure safety, paint dots were introduced on the feet of PVC figurines to indicate they had passed quality tests. Different colors were also used to identify production locations. Ultimately, tests by the Department of Health revealed no significant risk, allowing National Benzole to resume sales of smurf figures.\n\nContrary to popular belief, the production of Smurf figurines given away during petrol promotions continues to this day. The love for Smurfs, especially in countries like Belgium and Germany, remains strong, resulting in a thriving global hobby. To date, over 400 different figures have been produced, and Schleich introduces eight new figurines every year. The cumulative sales of Smurf figurines have now exceeded 300 million.\n\nJoin the Smurf craze and explore the world of Smurf figurines.

To create facial features, a special type of plastic called polyvinyl chloride (PVC) is used as it has an excellent combination of toughness and flexibility. This allows for a seamless look and feel, as well as clear and crisp details.\n\nThe body shapes of Smurf figurines are also made of PVC. This makes the figures durable and long-lasting while allowing them to stand up in different poses or moveable limbs. Some Smurf figures have hidden joints that allow for more creative playtime with your favorite Smurf character.\n\nThe vibrant colors of these figures come from plastic-based paint with strong pigment content. This is the same kind of paint used to make model airplanes and other detailed collectibles, so it’s able to hold up over time without fading or cracking. With this unique combination of materials, every detail of your favorite Smurf character will come to life.\n\nConclusion\n\nSmurf figurines are an iconic part of pop culture that has been bringing joy to fans around the world since 1958.
