        "text": "Energy Balances and Electricity Profiles - Concepts and definitions\n\nThe methodology and format of the energy balances presented in the Energy Balances and Electricity Profiles follow the guidelines provided in the UN publications: Concepts and methods in Energy Statistics, with special reference to Energy Accounts and Balances and Energy Statistics: A Manual for Developing Countries.\n\nDESCRIPTION OF THE ROWS OF THE ENERGY BALANCE\n\nProduction of primary energy (row 1): Primary energy refers to energy sources as found in their natural state (as opposed to derived or secondary energy, which is the result of the transformation of primary or secondary sources). Production of primary energy refers to the quantity of fuels which are extracted or produced, calculated after any operation for removal of inert matter. In general, production includes the quantities consumed by the producer in the production process (e.g. for heating or operation of equipment or auxiliaries) as well as supplies to other producers of energy for transformation or other uses. Data on the production of hard coal and lignite refer to coal after washing and screening for the removal of inorganic matter. Production of natural gas liquids is shown together with the production of crude petroleum. Data for natural gas refer to dry marketable production measured after purification and extraction of natural gas liquids and sulphur. Extraction losses and the amounts that have been reinjected, flared, and vented are excluded. Production includes quantities used within the natural gas industry, in gas extraction, pipeline systems and processing plants. Production of primary electricity refers to gross production of electrical energy of nuclear, hydro, geothermal, wind, tide, wave and solar origin. Biomass production includes only that portion used for fuel purposes.\n\nImports (row 2) and exports (row 3) refer to the amount of fuels obtained from or supplied to other countries. Fuels in transit are excluded. Imports and exports of crude petroleum also include imports and exports of feedstocks, unrefined and semi-refined oils and components derived from crude petroleum. In the energy balance format, imports are positive numbers, and exports are negative numbers and carry a negative sign (-).\n\nMarine/aviation bunkers (row 4) refer to the amounts of fuels delivered to ocean-going ships or aircraft of all flags engaged in international traffic. Consumption by ships engaged in transport in inland and coastal waters, or by aircraft engaged in domestic flights, is not included. The minus sign is used for entries under this item.\n\nStock changes (row 5) (at producers, importers and industrial consumers) refer to the difference between the amounts of fuels in stocks at the beginning and end of the year. A positive number indicates a reduction in stocks and thus an increase in available energy; the negative sign (-) indicates a net increase in stocks and thus a decrease in energy available for consumption.\n\nTotal energy requirements (row 6) is computed as: production (row 1) + imports (row 2) - exports (row 3) - bunkers (row 4) - stock changes (row 5).\n\nEnergy converted (row 7) shows the net input of primary and derived energy into the conversion or transformation process for the purpose of obtaining other derived products, and the net output of the derived energy. Inputs carry a minus sign, and outputs, which relate to gross production, are shown as positive numbers. Row 7 represents the sum of items from row 8 to row 16.\n\nNet transfers (row 17) comprise the net movements of energy products between processes in different sectors, for example, the blending of natural gas in the manufactured gas stream, the diversion of products (feedstocks) for further processing in the refining industry or the transfer of products for blending. Transfers \"out\" carry a negative sign, and transfers \"in\" are shown as positive numbers.\n\nConsumption by the energy sector (row 18) comprises the consumption of fuels and electricity used by the energy producing industries, e.g. for heating, lighting, and operation of all equipment used in the extraction process, for traction and distribution. It includes the quantities consumed in compression stations and pumping stations of oil and gas pipelines, as well as the station use and loss of electric power plants (including electricity used for pumping at pumped storage installations). The minus sign is used for entries under this item.\n\nLosses in transport and distribution (row 19) refer to the losses of fuels and electrical energy, which occur outside the utilities or plants before reaching the final consumer. The losses carry a minus sign.\n\nConsumption for non-energy uses (row 20) refers to the quantity of energy products consumed as raw materials in the chemical, petrochemical and other industries, not in order to produce energy. The minus sign is used for entries under this item.\n\nStatistical differences (row 21) in the energy balance are calculated as follows: total energy requirements (row 6) +/- energy converted (row 7) +/- net transfers (row 17) - consumption by the energy sector (row 18) - losses in transport and distribution (row 19) - consumption for non-energy uses (row 20) - final consumption (row 22).\n\nFinal consumption (row 22) refers to the consumption of primary and derived energy by industry and construction, by transport and by households, agriculture and other consumers.\n\nConsumption by industry and construction (row 23) is broken down into the iron and steel industry, the chemical industry and other industries and construction. Consumption in the chemical industry refers to use as fuel only. Fuels consumed by the energy sector, and all inputs into energy conversion, such as fuels used by industrial/self producers of thermal electricity, are excluded.\n\nConsumption by transport (row 27) includes all fuels consumed by road traffic, by ships engaged in transport in inland and coastal waters and aircraft engaged in domestic flights, and by railways. Fuels consumed by agricultural equipment are included in agricultural consumption.\n\nConsumption by households and other consumers (row 33) covers households (including free issues to employees), agriculture (including hunting, forestry and fishing) and all other sectors not included elsewhere (for example trade, communications and services such as public lighting).\n\nDESCRIPTION OF THE COLUMNS OF THE ENERGY BALANCE\n\nHard coal, lignite and peat (column 1)\n\nHard coal - Coal that has a high degree of coalification with a gross calorific value above 23,865 KJ/kg (5,700 kcal/kg) on an ash-free but moist basis, and a mean random reflectance of vitrinite of at least 0.6. Slurries, middlings and other low-grade coal products, which cannot be classified according to the type of coal from which they are obtained, are included under hard coal. There are two sub-categories of hard coal: (i) coking coal and (ii) other bituminous coal and anthracite (also known as steam coal). Coking coal is a hard coal with a quality that allows the production of coke suitable to support a blast furnace charge. Steam coal is coal used for steam raising and space heating purposes and includes all anthracite coals and bituminous coals not classified as coking coal.\n\nLignite - One of the two sub-categories of brown coal. Brown coal is coal with a low degree of coalification which retained the anatomical structure of the vegetable matter from which it was formed. It has a mean random reflectance of vitrinite of less than 0.6, provided that the gross calorific value (on a moist ash-free basis) is less than 23,865 KJ/kg (5,700 kcal/kg). Brown coal comprises: (i) lignite - non-agglomerating coals with a gross calorific value less than 17,435 KJ/kg (4,165 kcal/kg) and greater than 31 per cent volatile matter on a dry mineral matter free basis and (ii) sub-bituminous coal - non-agglomerating coals with a gross calorific value between 17,435 KJ/kg (4,165 kcal/kg) and 23,865 KJ/kg (5,700 kcal/kg) containing more than 31 per cent volatile matter on a dry mineral matter free basis.\n\nPeat - A solid fuel formed from the partial decomposition of dead vegetation under conditions of high humidity and limited air access (initial stage of coalification). Only peat used as fuel is included. Its principal use is as a household fuel.\n\nBriquettes and cokes (column 2)\n\nPatent fuel (hard coal briquettes) - A composition fuel manufactured from coal fines by shaping with the addition of a binding agent (pitch).\n\nLignite briquettes - A composition fuel manufactured from lignite.

Raw peat, after crushing and drying, is molded under high pressure into an even-shaped briquette without the addition of binders.\n\nCoke - The solid residue obtained from coal or lignite by heating it to a high temperature in the absence or near absence of air. It is high in carbon and low in moisture and volatile matter. Several categories are distinguished:\n\na) Coke-oven coke - The solid product obtained from carbonization of coal, principally coking coal, at high temperature. Coke-oven coke is also called metallurgical coke and is used mainly in the iron and steel industry. Semi-coke, the solid product obtained from carbonization of coal at low temperature, is included with coke-oven coke. It is used mainly as a domestic fuel.\n\nb) Gas coke - A by-product of coal used for the production of gas works gas in gasworks. Gas coke is mainly used as a domestic fuel.\n\nc) Brown coal coke - A solid product obtained from carbonization of brown coal briquettes.\n\nCrude oil and natural gas liquids (NGL) (column 3)\n\nCrude oil - A mineral oil consisting of a mixture of hydrocarbons of natural origin, yellow to black in color, of variable density and viscosity. Data in this category also includes lease or field condensate (separator liquids) which is recovered from gaseous hydrocarbons in lease separation facilities, as well as synthetic crude oil, mineral oils extracted from bituminous minerals such as shales and bituminous sand, and oils from coal liquefaction.\n\nNatural gas liquids (NGL) - Liquid or liquefied hydrocarbons produced in the manufacture, purification and stabilization of natural gas. NGL's include, but are not limited to, ethane, propane, butane, pentane, natural gasolene, and plant condensate.

It distills between 35oC and 200oC, and is treated to reach a sufficiently high octane number of generally between 80 and 100 RON. Treatment may be by reforming, blending with an aromatic fraction, or the addition of benzole or other additives (such as tetraethyl lead).\n\nNatural gasolene - Light spirit extracted from wet natural gas, often in association with crude petroleum. It is used as a petroleum refinery and petrochemical plant input and is also used directly for blending with motor spirit without further processing.\n\nJet fuel - Consists of gasolene-type jet fuel and kerosene-type jet fuel.\n\nGasolene-type jet fuel - All light hydrocarbon oils for use in aviation gas-turbine engines. It distills between 100oC and 250oC with at least 20% of volume distilling at 143oC. It is obtained by blending kerosene and gasolene or naphtha in such a way that the aromatic content does not exceed 25% in volume. Additives are included to reduce the freezing point to -58oC or lower, and to keep the Reid vapour pressure between 0.14 and 0.21 kg/cm2.\n\nKerosene-type jet fuel - Medium oil for use in aviation gas-turbine engines with the same distillation characteristics and flash point as kerosene, with a maximum aromatic content of 20% in volume.

Other names for this product are burning oil, vaporizing oil, power kerosene and illuminating oil.\n\nNaphtha - Light or medium oil distilling between 30oC and 210oC, for which there is no official definition, but which does not meet the standards laid down for motor spirit. The properties depend upon consumer specification. The C:H ratio is usually 84:14 or 84:16, with a very low sulphur content. Naphtha may be further blended or mixed with other materials to make high-grade motor gasolene or jet fuel, or may be used as a raw material for manufactured gas. Naphtha is sometimes used as input to feedstocks to make various kinds of chemical products, or may be used as a solvent.\n\nWhite spirit/industrial spirit - A highly refined distillate with a boiling point ranging from 135oC to 200oC, which is used as a paint solvent and for dry-cleaning purposes.\n\nHeavy petroleum products (column 5)\n\nHeavy products are defined here as products obtained by the distillation of crude petroleum at temperatures above 350oC, and which have a specific gravity higher than 0.83.

Its flash point is always above 50oC and its specific gravity is higher than 0.82. Heavy oils obtained by blending are grouped together with gas oils on the condition that their kinematic viscosity does not exceed 27.5 cSt at 38oC. Also included are middle distillates intended for the petrochemical industry. Gas-diesel oils are used as a fuel for internal combustion in diesel engines, as a burner fuel in heating installations, such as furnaces, and for enriching water gas to increase its luminosity. Other names for this product are diesel fuel, diesel oil, gas oil and solar oil.\n\nOther petroleum products (column 6)\n\nLubricants - Viscous, liquid hydrocarbons rich in paraffin waxes, distilling between 380oC and 500ºC, obtained by vacuum distillation of oil residues from atmospheric distillation.
