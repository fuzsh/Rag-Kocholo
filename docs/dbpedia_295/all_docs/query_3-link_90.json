Tony worked in a Cumbrian iron mine when he left Bedford School at the age of 17. He later worked in coal mines, a brass tube factory and a copper mine and studied mining engineering at Imperial College London. He received the diploma in journalism from the Regent Street Polytechnic, worked technical journals and on the Sunday Express and Sunday Mirror before turning to technical journalism, in Sheffield, for 10 years. He was an active member of the Sheffield Junior Chamber of Commerce of which he was chairman of the Local Affairs, Business Affairs and Public Speaking committees and editor of The Hub, the chamber’s monthly magazine. At the 1963 conference in Tel Aviv of Junior Chamber International, he was acknowledged as the editor of the best junior chamber magazine in the world. He moved into the steel industry to write technical reports for Operations Research (OR) scientists. There he found satisfaction in solving production problems, and studied OR, mathematics, statistics and computing, leading to an external degree from University College London. He moved into steel research and became head of process computing and statistics. Much of his work was in design and analysis of experiments for which he received his PhD. He co-authored the first interactive statistics package to be written in Fortran. When the laboratories closed, he joined the medical faculty of University of Sheffield where he was statistician to a multi-centre study of cot death. He taught medical statistics to undergraduates, supported post-graduates and medical staff with consultancy. Tony moved to Belfast as professor of medical computing and statistics at Queen’s University. Early retirement enabled him to work as a research consultant. Tony’s passion is to persuade all scientists and engineers to write, speak and present their work in language that other people understand well enough to use. And, like W.B. Yeats, he asks scientists to “think like a wise man but communicate in the language of the people”. Like Isaac Asimov, he is “on fire to explain and doesn’t indulge in scholarly depth”. He believes strongly that the economic fortune of Europe depends on the success in the world markets of our manufacturing industries. “Statisticians and statistical practitioners across Europe know that statistical methods have improved business and industrial peformance – and can do so in the future”, he says. “Our national quality of life will be improved and secured if we can communicate the philosophy, as well as the methods, of statistics to engineers and others in the manufacturing and the service industries. Businessmen and engineers need to understand the benefits of applied probability and\n\nx\n\nAbout the Author\n\nstatistics; they need to understand how the methods are applied to their own work; they need to be fully converted to a frame of mind that will make them automatically question sources of variability in everything that they do and, without outside prompting, adopt the statistical approach”.\n\nHe and others founded ENBIS to stimulate the application of statistical methods to economic and technical development and to business and industry across the whole of Europe. They have created a networking forum for the exchange of ideas between statistical practitioners. He has spread this passion by speaking in many cities across Europe from Tel Aviv, through Turin, Budapest, Ljubljana, Copenhagen, Brussels, Sheffield, Newcastle and London.\n\nList of Contributors Claire Abson Sheffield Hallam University, Sheffield, UK Alastair Allan University of Sheffield, Sheffield, UK Douglas G.

I read the second edition and looked for competition. There is no other book about research methods as good as yours”. She assured me that I could apply my own style and that she and others at Wiley would help me as much as they could. Years have passed since the first edition, and I have grown old, so this is my last work for the scientific and technical literature. I have depended entirely on all authors of chapters, for whose patience and understanding I am immensely grateful. They are all erudite and enthusiastic about their own subjects and eager to inspire you, our students, to do first-class research. I hope my own story will also inspire you. This is a personal story. Perhaps this is the wrong place for a personal story but I want to tell it, as my attempt to inspire you. “Is statistics a science?” is a hackneyed old question. It discomforts me. The question is needless. It is needless because it is predicated by the assumption that there are many sciences. We have split science into several separate sciences, but the splits are artificial. What is my science? I am a scientist. (No splits.) We do split science into subject areas for pedagogical convenience in schools and universities. I do remember most of the chemistry, physics and biology I learned at school 70 years ago. I could not claim to be a chemist, physicist or biologist. But I would not say, as I was once shocked to hear a statistician say, “I cannot discuss the design of an aerofoil because I am not an aeronautical engineer; I am a statistician”. Statistics is a part of science, but it is not ‘a science’; it is a subject area within science just as is chemistry. And it has no discrete boundary, as neither does chemistry. Statistics provides method to science: Do you ever notice something; describe it; ask yourself, “What is it? Why is it? Where it it? Is it useful to me or to anybody else? Does it have any relationship to anything else?” Then you have the makings of a scientist.\n\nBut, and this is where the usefulness of statistics arrives, do you then invent a working assumption, called a hypothesis, that is consistent with what you have observed? If you do, can you then use the hypothesis to make predictions? Now, you must see clearly that statistics is an essential tool of science. You can test your predictions by experiments or further observations and modify the hypothesis in the light of your results. The scientific method insists that you keep revising your hypothesis\n\nxiv\n\nPreface to the Third Edition\n\nand experimenting until you can detect no discrepancies between your hypothesis and your observations. You may then, correctly in the scientific realm, tell the world that you have a theory that may explain a class of phenomena. A theory, by my description and by dictionary definition, is a framework within which observations are explained and predictions are made. I once proposed a curriculum approach to representation of statistics as the cement for binding science’s subject areas. This was in a paper, The polymath consultant, at the first meeting of ICOTS (International Conference on Teaching Statistics). The Times newspaper published a short version of it. The UK secretary of state for education, Keith Joseph, was interested enough to invite me to discuss it, and he encouraged me to promote the idea in universities. Nobody else took any notice. Yet I still believe that there was an idea that could be developed as part of our search for the future of data analysis. We must teach that statistical methods are just as part of, and just as applicable, in social studies as they are in physics and chemistry; and that they are as useful in linguistics, history and geography as much as they are in engineering and marketing. Collections of worked practical cases, such as those by Cox and Snell (1981), must help and we need more of them. A recent book (Greenfield and Metcalfe 2007) aims at this with more than 50 worked cases about school absence, metro noise levels, water fluoridation, diamond prospecting, wine tasting, compulsive gambling, prosthetic heart valves and many more. Evidence is the life-blood of science and scepticism is its spark of life. Data analysis is the flux of evidence. We should continue to ensure that all scientists, in all subject areas, and these include you, perceive it as such. Always you must be sceptical about any assertion that has no evidential support. Nullius in verba. Frances Ashcroft, a truly great scientist of this, the twenty-first century, tells us in a recent book how her own research excited her. I discovered that the KATP channel sits in the membrane that envelops the beta-cell and regulates its electrical activity and thereby insulin release.… The breakthrough came late at night when I was working alone.… I was ecstatic. I was dancing in the air, shot high into the sky on the rocket of excitement with the stars exploding in vivid colours all around me. Even recalling that moment sends excitement fizzing through my veins, and puts a smile on my face. There is nothing — nothing at all — that compares to the exhilaration of discovery, of being the first person on the planet to see something new and understand what it means. It comes all too rarely to a scientist, perhaps just once in a lifetime, and usually requires years of hard grind to get there. But the delight of discovery is truly magical, a life-transforming event that keeps you at the bench even when times are tough. It makes science an addictive pursuit. That night I felt like stout Cortez, silent upon his peak in Darien, gazing out across not the Pacific Ocean, but a landscape of the mind. It was crystal clear where my mental journey must take me, what experiments were needed and what the implications were. Next morning, all certainty swept away, I felt sure my beautiful result was merely a mistake. There was only one way to find out. Repeat the experiment — again and again and again. That is the daily drudgery of a scientific life: it is very far from the ecstasy of discovery. The Spark of Life Electricity in the Human Body Frances Ashcroft\n\nPreface to the Third Edition\n\nxv\n\nSuch reporting inspired me to read the rest of the book even though, in her last paragraph, she warns that all of us, including you, cannot expect winning without drudgery. Thomas Edison expressed this well: Genius is one percent inspiration, ninety-nine percent perspiration. Spoken statement (c. 1903); published in Harper’s Monthly (September 1932)\n\nMany writers in the past have felt the same elation as Frances Ashcroft. John Keats, for example, recorded that feeling: Then felt I like some watcher of the skies When a new planet swims into his ken; Or like stout Cortez when with eagle eyes He star’d at the Pacific — and all his men Look’d at each other with a wild surmise — Silent, upon a peak in Darien. John Keats\n\nMary Shelley told us how Doctor Frankenstein’s feeling went further from the beauty of scientific achievement to disgust at what he had done. The different accidents of life are not so changeable as the feelings of human nature. I had worked hard for nearly two years, for the sole purpose of infusing life into an inanimate body. For this I had deprived myself of rest and health. I had desired it with an ardour that far exceeded moderation; but now that I had finished, the beauty of the dream vanished, and breathless horror and disgust filled my heart. Frankenstein (chapter 5) Mary Wolstencroft Shelley\n\nIf, as a scientist, you can keep powering the bellows that inflame your spark of inspiration into a bright light of scientific achievement, scientists will acknowledge that you are one of them. But, first, you must be sure that you believe you are a scientist. You must have started somewhere, sometime. Here is how and when and where I started. “Tell Father that lunch is ready,” said Mother. “He’s in the garage”. I loved Sunday lunch when I was six, especially when it was roast beef, Yorkshire pudding, dark green cabbage and rich gravy. I went to the garage to summon Father to the table where he would display his knife sharpening and carving skills. He was on the floor, asleep, and his face had a bluish greenish tinge. I ran to Mother. She quickly opened the doors and windows and called an ambulance. She dragged him onto the lawn and pumped his chest. He breathed and his face turned grey. An ambulance arrived. The men put a mask over his face. It was connected by a rubber tube to a cylinder of oxygen. His face turned pink. The ambulance drove away and we had lunch, a little late. Carbon black is an amorphous carbon with a high surface-area-to-volume ratio. It is used as a pigment and reinforcement in rubber and plastic products. It also helps to conduct heat away from the tread and belt area of the tyre, reducing thermal damage and increasing tyre life. It is very expensive. It was even more expensive when I was six and Father thought he could make a lot of money by producing it from cheap by-products, usually discarded, from coal\n\nxvi\n\nPreface to the Third Edition\n\ndistillation or coke making. One of these was naphtha and, as a chemical engineer, he knew where he could get as much as he wanted very cheap. In those days, the Americans made most of the world’s carbon black from natural gas and it cost about £5000 a ton (imperial spelling): a lot, especially if you convert that into today’s money. Nowadays, with many more sources of materials and more efficient production, it is worth about £500 a tonne (note the SI spelling). Father explained as much of this to me as I could understand and he showed me his experimental machine. So far as I can remember, nearly 60 years later, it comprised a rotating drum with cooling water circulating through it. There was a row of tiny jets through which he pumped naphtha that burned, with only partial combustion, so that carbon black deposited on the cold drum surface. Naphtha is a crude mix of oils that drained out of the bottoms of coke ovens where it was used by burning to heat the ovens. I learned, when I was six, that Father was a scientist, an engineer and an experimentalist. But his research had its perils, including the possibility of carbon monoxide poisoning. Father explained many things to me over the years. He drove to a coke oven plant in Scunthorpe when I was 11. I went too but, in case I was bored, I carried a Just William book (by Richmal Compton). At the ovens, we sat all night measuring things as they happened. Father told me, “This is called ‘dynamic measuring’ ”. I watched, fascinated, as ink flowed onto rotating graphs. In the morning, Father analysed the data and advised the works manager on how to improve his benzole production. Benzole (a mix of benzene and toluene) had been seen, by coke-makers, as a waste by-product. In 1942, it was an essential fuel for the Spitfire. This was science in the raw and I was excited, never bored. I was 15 when I bought an ancient motorbike that wouldn’t go. Father commented that I would be a competent mechanic and understand internal combustion engines by the time I was allowed to drive it. A year later I had fixed it but petrol was rationed. I decided to make my own. I had fitted the bike with acetylene lights instead of electric lights. A local garage gave me a drum of (calcium) carbide that they no longer needed. Water drips onto carbide to produce acetylene which, at one time, was used for lighting. I also knew that acetylene (C2 H2 ) could be polymerised to benzene (C6 H6 ) by contact with red-hot iron or most alloys in which iron is the dominant component, at about 700 o C. I wound an electric fire element round the gap between two silicon tubes which I sealed into a large silicon jar connected by a rubber tube to an acetylene generator more than a metre from the jar. I intended to send acetylene into the jar; heat from the fire element would draw the gas up and then down again until benzene appeared. When, eventually, I had made a litre of benzene, I would experiment with mixed proportions of paraffin (not rationed) to discover the best mix to drive my motorbike. Grandpa’s brick garage was integral to the house. Father’s was wooden and that is where I had my benzene plant. The power switch was by the door. I started the acetylene generator and let it run for about 10 minutes to expunge all air from the jar. Then I switched on the power; and watched. Two minutes later, I saw: drip…drip…drip…from the silicon tubes. Frances Ashcroft expressed my feelings later: “I was ecstatic. I was dancing in the air, shot high into the sky on the rocket of excitement with the stars exploding in vivid colours all around me.” I watched, enslaved by the sight of my success, but for only a few seconds. A crack of thunder, a great white light, and the apparatus went through the roof and fell in the garden.\n\nPreface to the Third Edition\n\nxvii\n\nI studied the hole in the roof and caught the next bus to Worthing. I arrived home late at night. Father was still up. I said nothing. “Are you afraid of me?” he asked. “Yes”. “No need”, he said. “I am proud of you”. Weeks later, my physics master said Father had told him the story and he, too, was proud of me. “You will be a good experimentalist”, he predicted, “but you will always be the servant of others unless you learn about patents”. When that teacher demonstrated the Michelson–Morley experiment, and said it proved that ether did not exist, I said perhaps it did but it may have properties that were hidden from the experiment. “You have a curious mind, Greenfield”, he said. Father said I had a hypothesis as good as any, and he encouraged me to design an experiment to test it. Red shift is generally accepted as evidence of universal expansion. Father again encouraged me to design an experiment to test an alternative hypothesis. Although we borrowed a quarry to set up an experiment, the apparatus we designed and built was not good enough. At 18, I had my first provisional patent for a photographic colour method using the five oxides of vanadium. Kodak were interested but couldn’t improve on my colours, the worst of which gave brown instead of green. Thirty years later: “I like your style”, said the visiting professor.\n\nHis compliment came towards the end of the first course I gave on research methods to the medical faculty of Queen’s University, Belfast. The course arose from my experiences in steel research, in Sheffield University and in Queen’s University. In all of these I had found a shocking inability among scientific researchers to write and to speak clearly about their research. Scientific books and papers are so mysterious, so arcane, so bewildering, that scientists can understand only those of their own speciality. They are obscure to others. I had also been shocked in all these places by the lack of appreciation of statistical and other research methods. A short, sharp course was needed. The faculty dean agreed and encouraged me to run such a course, which I did every year for five years. Students ranged from new medical graduates to senior consultants and professors. Teachers included the dean, a librarian, computer staff, statisticians, professors of clinical psychology, epidemiology and chemical pathology, and the chairman of the research ethics committee. “I didn’t know I had a style”, I replied. “What is it?” “You always look as if you don’t know what you will say next”, the visiting professor told me.\n\nI knew that was true. I always watch students’ faces and look into their eyes to be sure that they understand what I am saying. That is an essence of teaching, but it is hard in a lecture hall with 150 students; it is easy in a classroom with no more than 30, which I had. I can’t see the eyes of students when they read a text book, but I can try to write in a style that will grab and keep their attention. Contributors to earlier editions of this book agreed. Unfortunately, the publisher’s editors disagreed and, in my view, ruined the style of the second edition. They made changes to the text that were far beyond acceptable editing. They were changes with which I did not agree: changes that affected my style and the styles of other authors. They refused to repair the damage, and eventually I surrendered.\n\nxviii\n\nPreface to the Third Edition\n\nFelix Grant, author of one chapter, wrote to me: “Watching the progress of this whole spectacle has been an education. I shall never look at Hodder or their imprints in the same way again, not only as a writer but as a professional and as an educational book buyer. I admire your tenacity and integrity; I hope I have the same level of commitment to what matters, if it should come to that. I am, after a break of two decades, currently starting on the long process of steering a book of my own through ‘another publisher’. If your experience with Hodder turns out to be typical of changes in publishing’s attitudes to quality and verity over that time, I shall be very disappointed”. I apologise to Felix for my surrender, and to other authors and readers who feel the same. Felix wrote again for this edition. I wish he could see it. Sadly, he died a few months before we went to press. Wiley have promised no such desecration. They like and enjoy the style that I have encouraged all authors to adopt. Their editors (Debbie Cox and Heather Kay) agree with John Gribbin who wrote, in his New Scientist review of the first edition, “The most useful book any new postgraduate could ever buy”. Debbie, Heather and Richard Davies have supported this project wonderfully. For myself, and for all the authors and readers, I thank them. But some authors know that during the course of this work I have developed Parkinson’s disease. This delayed production for four years. Heather recruited two angels to help. One is Sue Greener (see chapters 2, 12, 15, 16, 37, and 38) a delightful and positive writer and editor. The other is Liz, my wife, who eagerly follows Heather’s instructions to keep me going and keeps in touch with Sue. Now we have the best edition with revised chapters, new chapters and new writers. You will enjoy reading this book so much that you won’t want to put it down. You will start with a journey through the general research scene.… This is where the hard work begins: collect data, analyse and interpret data, and write and publish articles, news items, technical reports and a thesis that you must present to your examiners. You, the researcher, the problem solver, are responsible to a manager: in a company, a university or a government department. You must report results so that the manager can understand them enough to make decisions. Research does not end with design and analysis. You must interpret and communicate the results. Unless you can describe and explain your results to people who do not share your analytic skills, your results will be worthless. Read the book. I have no data yet. It is a capital mistake to theorise before one has data. Insensibly one begins to twist fact to suit theories, instead of theories to suit facts. Sherlock Holmes A Scandal in Bohemia\n\nTony Greenfield\n\nPreface to the Second Edition ‘This just might be the most useful book any new post-graduate contemplating research could ever buy’, wrote John Gribbin in his New Scientist review of the first edition of Research Methods. Agreement with that view came from post-graduate researchers. Supervisors and teachers welcomed the book as a prop, even the main course book, for post-graduate courses in research methods. Comments and advice flowed in and technology advanced. The time arrived for a second edition. Liz Gooster replaced Nicki Dennis as the publisher’s commissioning editor and we worked well together. Fortunately, most of the original contributors were willing to revise their chapters but we needed authors for new chapters and some for a few replacements. The Internet and the World Wide Web are here and they have had a profound influence on the ways of post-graduates. This needed to be reflected in many chapters: library, literature reviews, search for funds, information technology and computers, sources of population statistics. References to further reading via the WWW can be offered for almost every chapter. Reviewers’ comments on the first edition were almost all favourable. Here are a few:\n\nr Good coverage of major topics relevant to our students (PG training course). r Useful reference material for students with their dissertations and analysing results (MSc Oncology).\n\nr Good introduction to many of the skills required by research students. r I have used it a great deal myself. I needed to know about surveys and sampling. r Most useful section is on presentation, particularly Writing the thesis. r Aims and approach are sound, even if broad and ambitious. Text well written, concise and convincing. Well-structured. Argument easy to read and digest. Every reader should learn something. New PG students will learn a great deal. r Great strength is the scope and interdisciplinary appeal. r No comparable book. Some chapters, I was told, may be of interest to some students but had little relevance to others. Well I believe that there is something in every chapter for almost all research students so I asked the authors to refer to many more illustrations of the diverse relevance of their advice. You will find the response in, for example, chapter 28 Instrumentation for research, and in chapter 33 The value of mathematical models.\n\nPreface to the Second Edition\n\nxx\n\nSome comments could not be reconciled. For example:\n\nr Students from engineering valued this book. r Not specific enough for engineers. Suggestions included:\n\nr More emphasis on the Internet. r Some exciting new developments in using the Internet for teaching and research are coming from chemistry departments around the world. Students can send their experimental data across the world and receive it back from computer, spectroscopic or other forms of processing. Similar services for other subjects. r Have a chapter on WAP (Wireless Application Protocol) technology, knowledge based searches and alerts over the Internet and digital television and other multi-media systems. r Chapter needed on navigating the WWW. r Reflect diversity of software packages. r More on creativity. There is certainly much more emphasis on the Internet and on the WWW. The diversity of software packages, particularly for statistical analysis, is discussed. We have four chapters on creativity. I tried very hard to recruit an author to describe what is happening in chemistry, looking in university departments and in industry, but I failed. ‘He didn’t ask me,’ some reader will say. Well please, dear reader, write to me soon, so that we can start to plan the third edition. Nor could I find an author to tell us about WAP. For these, and other topics, I need suggestions and volunteers. I should also like your comments about how the book is used. I believe it is a good reference text for any post-graduate student. I also believe it is a good framework for any postgraduate research course. Do you agree? A further suggestion was to construct a FAQ page on the publisher’s website. I know this is being considered. Perhaps, by the time this new edition reaches your desk, the page will be there, ready for you to use. Finally, thanks again to all contributors: those from the first edition for their continuing support; the new recruits for this edition for putting their faith and effort into such a valuable publication. And thanks to Liz Gooster for encouraging and helping me in my role as editor of ‘the most useful book any new post-graduate contemplating research could ever buy’. Tony Greenfield\n\nPreface to the First Edition The government proposed in 1994 in their White Paper Realising our Potential that all graduates who wish to study for doctorates should first take a one-year master’s course in research methods. Several universities have since introduced such courses and more are planned. This book is a response to that development. It is not intended to be a deeply detailed textbook, rather a set of notes for guidance, to nudge the student’s mind into useful avenues, to tell him or her what help is available and to show how he or she can help themselves. This guidance includes many references for further study. As a set of notes it should be useful to all researchers, those studying for doctorates as well as for masters’ degrees, for their lecturers too and, indeed, for anybody in any field of research even if a higher qualification is not expected. The breadth of the subject rules out a single author: none but the most arrogant would pretend to such ability. The publishers and I therefore decided that we should seek contributions from many authors. This posed difficulties of recruitment, of meeting deadlines, of agreeing a common philosophy and adhering to it, and of imposing an editorial style without causing offence to the authors. These difficulties were resolved because there was one clear bond between all the authors: an enthusiasm to help young people to plan, manage, analyse and report their research better than they may otherwise. All of them are busy and successful as researchers and as teachers. I believe that all readers of this book will appreciate how much time and effort, as well as knowledge and experience, the contributors have devoted to its production. Unusually, this preface is titled Preface to the first edition. This is because I have no doubt that there will be subsequent editions. The situation will change with the introduction of more courses on research methods and experience will accumulate. I invite all readers to tell me how it can be improved: what should be added, what should be omitted, and what should be rewritten. But if you like any of it, please write and tell me. I shall forward your comments on to the authors. They deserve your praise. Tony Greenfield\n\nPart I First Steps\n\n1 A View of Research Tony Greenfield\n\nIntroduction Research, depending on your viewpoint, is:\n\nr a quest for knowledge and understanding; r an interesting, and perhaps useful, experience; r a course for qualification; r a career; r a style of life; r an essential process for commercial success; r a way to improve human quality of life; r an ego boost for you; and/or r a justification for funds for your department and its continued existence. To me, research is an art aided by skills of inquiry, experimental design, data collection, measurement and analysis, by interpretation, and by presentation. A further skill, which can be acquired and developed, is creativity or invention. This book is mainly about the former set of skills, inquiry to presentation. Further useful topics are described, such as: how to find funds, how to protect your intellectual property and how to share and use the results when your research is concluded. But first: a few words about the origin of this book. The first edition was inspired by the government’s proposal in 1994 that all graduates who wish to study for doctorates should first take a one-year master’s course in research methods. Whether or not you agree with this, you may agree that some notes for guidance of post-graduate research students would be useful. Many universities have followed the government’s proposal and have created research methods courses. There is already a place for this book. Whether you are studying a master’s course in research methods, or doing some research for a master’s degree or a doctorate, you can be guided by this book. Research Methods for Postgraduates, Third Edition. Edited by Tony Greenfield with Sue Greener. © 2016 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd. Published 2016 by John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.\n\n4\n\nResearch Methods for Postgraduates\n\nHowever, research is a big subject, and it would not be possible to write a single volume about it in any depth. This book is intended to be a general reference on all aspects of research methods and should be used as notes for guidance. Its content is intended to be fairly simple and easily intelligible by most readers. There are references to more substantive texts. The many viewpoints and components of research methods persuaded me that several contributors would be needed. Fortunately, there are enough qualified people in universities, consultancy and industry who volunteered eagerly to write one or more chapters each. I asked them to write in a light style that could be read easily with a view to the reader picking up the general themes. I believe that between us we have achieved this but leave it now to you, the reader, to judge. If there are parts that you don’t understand, or that could be expressed more clearly, or if there are important omissions, please write to me or the publishers. Everything can be improved, especially a book, and your opinions will help us.\n\nContents These notes for your guidance have been divided into seven sections, with several chapters in each. Look through the contents list and see how the topics have been grouped. You may feel that some of the chapters are not for you. For example: do you know how to use the library? Of course you do! But do you? I suspect that many people who believe that they know how to find the right text at the right time will be happily surprised to discover how much easier the task becomes when qualified guidance is given. Surely you will want to know how to find funds for your research, but ‘Ethics? Ethics has nothing to do with my research’, you might say. It has. It has something to do with all research. Read the chapter and learn. You will run into difficulties. You will find problems of management, of resources, of people. There’s a chapter telling you who can help. I suggest you read it before you meet those problems. There are chapters too on planning your work, about keeping documents, about examining your research process and keeping it on course. There are several types of research and we have classified them as: clinical trials, laboratory and industrial experiments, agricultural experiments, and surveys. These may seem to be distinct but there is a general philosophy running through all of them, expressed in different ways by the different writers. You may think that because your research fits into one class of research, you can ignore the other three chapters in that section. Please make the effort to read those other three chapters. You will be stimulated to discover a new slant on your research. Glance quickly at the section on data analysis and you may think “I can leave that until much later, when I have some data to analyse.” Scientific method is about observing the world and collecting information so that you can understand the world better. The way in which you do this must surely depend on how you will process the information when you have collected it. The data you collect will depend on how you will analyse the data. Analysis is an essential feature of research, and you will make easier progress with your research the more you understand analysis. To some people it is hard and daunting. They would prefer to ignore it. To other people it is a challenge. Whichever is your viewpoint, make it a challenge and face it now. Honestly, the more you understand how you will analyse and interpret data, the better will be your planning and management of the way you collect it. The design of a good experiment depends on how the data from the experiment will be analysed.\n\nA View of Research\n\n5\n\nMathematical modelling and simulation may seem to be remote from the reality that you want to investigate in your research. They are powerful tools in many situations. Social, medical, economic and political systems, as well as physical, chemical and biological ones, can be described as mathematical models which can then be used in computers to predict the behaviour of those systems under various conditions. This is a useful approach to many types of research. While you read through the examples included in Part V, keep asking yourself how each example may relate to your research project. Whatever research you perform, you must present your results: in a thesis or dissertation, in reports and published papers and in stand-up talks or synchronous webinars to live audiences. There are many books about presentation, and some are recommended. Three chapters summarise the most useful points. Other chapters offer good advice about how to buy and use computers and instrumentation, how to sample from populations and interview people, how to protect your intellectual property and how to progress in your career.\n\nCreativity Four chapters about creativity were added in the second edition. As a brief stimulant, I have preserved the following paragraphs. Liam Hudson, in Contrary Imaginations: A Psychological Study of the English Schoolboy (Penguin, 1972), presents evidence that intelligence and creativity, as features of the human mind, are negatively correlated but that there are some fortunate people who are both intelligent and creative. The rare combination must be desirable in research, where we need both logic and imagination, where we need vision as well as the ability to plan and manage. But what is creativity? You are planning your research. You believe that every step on the way must be taken rationally. Indeed, that is the essence of most of this book: to guide you rationally through your work. But if you look at the most outstanding creative leaps in the history of science, you will see that they were all founded on an irrationality of thought. Well-known examples are: Watt’s invention of the separate condenser for the steam engine as he strolled in the country, Poincare’s theory of Fuchsian functions as he boarded a bus and Kekule’s discovery of the benzene ring as he dozed by the fireside. So, be prepared to note any odd thought you might have at an unexpected time in an unexpected place. And don’t discard unexpected results. Just because something doesn’t do what you planned it to do doesn’t mean it’s useless. Thomas Alva Edison\n\nNevertheless, you can bring to bear some methods of intellectual discovery:\n\nr Analogy: look for similarity between your problem and one for which the solution is known. Electrical circuits are envisioned as water flowing through tanks, pipes, pumps and valves; brain function is studied by comparison with computers. The more remote your analogy is from your problem, the more creative will be your solution. r By parts: break the problem into a series of sub-problems which you hope will be more amenable to solution.\n\nResearch Methods for Postgraduates\n\n6\n\nr By random guesses: Edison used it extensively, and brainstorming is a modern version of it.\n\nr Generalise: if a specific problem is baffling, write a general version of it; an algebraic model leads to simplified solutions compared with tackling complicated arithmetic head on.\n\nr Add: a difficult problem may be resolved by adding an auxiliary sub-problem. r Subtract: drop some of the complicating features of the original problem; this is a trick used in simulation to make it more tractable.\n\nr Particularise: look for a special case with a narrower set of conditions, such as tackling a two-dimensional example of a three-dimensional problem.\n\nr Stretch or contract: some problems are more tractable if their scale or the range of variables is altered.\n\nr Invert: look at the problem from the opposite viewpoint; instead of “When will this train arrive at Oxford?” ask, “When will Oxford arrive at this train?”\n\nr Restructure: in clinical studies, we do not ask if a treatment will cure a disease, but whether an inert treatment will fail to cure the disease.\n\nr The method of Pappus: assume the problem is solved and calculate backwards. r The method of Tertullus: assume a solution is impossible and try to prove why. Check each of these approaches, asking yourself how you might bring it to bear on your problem. Then, if you need any more stimulation, read the following: The Art of Scientific Investigation is a book by W.I.B. Beveridge published in 1950 but still, over half a century later, stimulating to read; G. Polya’s How to Solve It offers practical recipes; and Arthur Koestler’s The Act of Creation has a discussion of the working of the mind.\n\n2 The Research Journey: Four Steps to Success Tom Bourner and Sue Greener\n\nResearch can seem daunting to those who are new to it. This chapter has two aims:\n\nr to provide an overview of the research journey from start to finish; and r to demystify the business of research. Most research projects take quite a long time to complete. Research degrees, for example, usually take at least three years of full-time research. Completing a part-time research degree usually takes correspondingly longer. At the start, research can seem like an ill-defined mishmash of activities littered with hidden pitfalls. When you are in the middle of your research, it is sometimes difficult to see the woods for the trees. In this chapter, I suggest a map for keeping in perspective your research project as a whole. The map is designed to give you an overview of the whole research process as though you were in a helicopter looking down on it so that you can keep it in view from beginning to end. Research can also seem like a mysterious process: an arcane art practised by the cleverest people, employing obscure jargon and demanding an awesome depth of knowledge. This chapter offers an antidote to this intimidating view of research. Let’s start by considering a problem with which you will probably be familiar. Suppose that you are a young person wanting to get a flat; how would you go about it? Well, if you’re like most people, you would probably start online with a search for some relevant maps and local property prices, review what is currently advertised online and then get the local paper and visit some local estate agents and letting agencies to get an overview of what is available, perhaps printing details of flats you think could be possible. You would compare the features (such as price, size, location and amenities) of the different flats and make a short list of ones which are most likely to meet your needs. You’d probably then personally look over the ones that you’d selected for your short list. Afterwards, when you’d made your decision and you’re sitting in your new home, you’d probably reflect on the process: the extent to which your Research Methods for Postgraduates, Third Edition. Edited by Tony Greenfield with Sue Greener. © 2016 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd. Published 2016 by John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.\n\nResearch Methods for Postgraduates\n\n8\n\nflat meets your original aspirations, what your first-hand experience has told you about the housing market, what you’ve learned from the experience and so on. Now, if you take off your flat-hunter’s spectacles and put on instead a pair of researcher’s spectacles, you will observe some similarities between that process of flat hunting and the process of research. Firstly, you did a literature review (local newspapers, online property sites and estate agents’ blurbs) to get an overview of the field. Secondly, you developed a theory of which of the available flats would be to your requirements (your short list). Thirdly, you tested the theory by inspecting those on your short list. Finally, you reflected on the experience and your results. Stated formally, the process contains four parts:\n\nr Part 1: reviewing the field r Part 2: theory building r Part 3: theory testing r Part 4: reflecting and integrating. Perhaps this sequence seems familiar. Perhaps you recognise it from other significant decisions you have made in your life: choosing a college, buying a mobile phone or choosing a job. With some decisions, it’s not possible to go through all the stages. For example, when you choose a job, the final test of your theory that you have chosen the right job is by doing the job. Unfortunately, this is possible only after you’ve committed yourself to the job. Perhaps that’s why so many unsatisfactory job decisions are made.1 Once you recognise that you are already familiar with each of the major parts of the research process through your experience of making the larger decisions of your life, you will have a valuable resource to draw on. Reflection on those experiences will also give you an indication of the possible pitfalls. That four-part process can help you to put what you are doing into a broader picture when you start to get bogged down in the detail of research. It can also be useful in designing your research project. Let us examine the parts of the process in more detail.\n\nPart 1: Reviewing the Field Many research projects arise from a study of current thinking in a field. The research project follows from identifying a gap in the literature. Most other research projects arise from awareness of a problem that is worth solving. In either case, a good start is an overview of current thinking in the field. In case you are impatient with this part of the process and want to start immediately with fieldwork, here are some reasons for spending time and effort on a review of the field:\n\nr to identify gaps in current knowledge; r to avoid reinventing the wheel (at the very least this will save time, and it can stop you from making the same mistakes as others); 1 The literature on labour turnover often refers to the period immediately following recruitment as the induction crisis,\n\nwhen job expectations are tested by the job realities.\n\nThe Research Journey: Four Steps to Success\n\n9\n\nr to carry on from where others have already reached (reviewing the field allows you to build on the platform of existing knowledge and ideas);\n\nr to identify other people working in the same and related fields (they provide you with a researcher network, which is a valuable resource indeed);\n\nr to increase your breadth of knowledge of the area in which your subject is located; r to identify the seminal works in your area; r to provide the intellectual context for your own work (this will enable you to position your project in terms of related work);\n\nr to identify opposing views; r to put your own work in perspective; r to provide evidence that you can access the previous significant work in an area; r to discover transferable information and ideas (information and insights that may be relevant to your own project); and\n\nr to discover transferable research methods (research methods that could be relevant to your own project).\n\nPart 2: Theory Building In some ways, theory building is the most personal and creative part of the research process. Some people find it the most exciting and challenging part of the whole business. In some cases, data collection precedes theory building and, in other cases, it follows it. Have you ever bought a used car? If so, you may have identified some possibles before narrowing down to a few probables. You collected data and then formed a theory about which of the cars would best meet your needs. In that situation, theory building followed data collection. The process of developing a theory by inspecting individual cases has a special name: induction. Our flat-hunting example is another illustration of induction. If, each time you are sent the details of a flat in a certain area of town, you notice that it is more expensive than you can afford, you may form the theory that all the flats in that area are too expensive for you. Acting on that theory, you may ask the estate agents to stop sending details of flats in that area. That is the process of induction at work again: forming a theory from information about specific instances. Induction is a type of generalisation. The other side of the coin from induction is deduction which involves reaching conclusions about specific instances from general principles. Here is an example of deduction: ‘I can’t afford to live in Mayfair so don’t bother to send me the details of any flats in that part of town’. In this example ‘I can’t afford to live in Mayfair’ is the generalisation, and deduction leads me to the conclusion about any specific flat in Mayfair that I can’t afford it. Induction is a thought process that takes you from the specific to the general. Deduction is a thought process that takes you from the general to the specific. We have seen how a theory can emerge from the data. However, theory can also emerge from armchair theorising, introspection, deduction following a review of the literature, personal experience, a fortuitous remark, a brainstorm, an apt metaphor or pure inspiration. Creativity has a role to play in all aspects of the research process, but especially in the theory-building part. I said earlier that data collection can precede theory building and that it can follow it. In the case of induction, data collection comes first. When data collection follows theory building, then it is usually for the purpose of testing the theory. That is the part of the research process that we turn to next.\n\nResearch Methods for Postgraduates\n\n10\n\nPart 3: Theory Testing Experience has shown each one of us it is very easy to deceive ourselves, to believe something which later experience shows us is not so. Carl Rogers (1955)\n\nWhen flat hunting, we wanted to check whether those attractive-sounding apartments, reported by the estate agent, would really meet our needs. Likewise, when we are doing research, we will want to check if the theory (or theories) that we have formulated fulfil our hopes and expectations. The sort of theory testing we do will depend on our ambitions and claims for our theory. If we want to claim that our theory applies generally,2 then we may want to use statistical methods (known as inferential statistics) which have been developed to enable us to make claims about whole populations from information about a sample from a population. If, however, your claims are only about the accuracy of your theory in the context of a particular situation,3 then theory testing may involve checking your conclusions (theory) from other perspectives. You may have looked at estate agents’ brochures, and now you want to look at the flats themselves, talk to the neighbours and so on. In research in the social sciences, the term triangulation is used to describe the process of checking if different data sources and different methods allow you to reach the same conclusions. Testing theory can take many forms. At one extreme, you may simply invite the reader of a research report to test the conclusions against his own experiences. The test is: does the reader say, ‘Aha! I can now make sense of my own experience in a new and convincing way’? But if the reader is unlikely to have first-hand experience for testing the researcher’s theory, or if the claims being made involve a high level of generality, then the theory-testing stage will be more formal and elaborate. At some level, however, theory testing is likely to be part of any research process.\n\nPart 4: Reflection and Integration Knowledge doesn’t exist in a vacuum, and your knowledge only has value in relation to other people’s. A.D. Jankowitz (1991)\n\nReflection and integration comprise the last stage of the research journey. There may be many things on which you want to reflect: what you have learned about the process of research, what you could have done differently and what you have learned about yourself. But there is one matter for reflection that is a crucial part of the research process itself. It will affect how your research is judged and the impact of your research. You must reflect on how your research findings relate to current thinking in the field of your research topic. Your reflection on how your research results relate to current thinking will include your assessment of where your research fits into the field of knowledge. It will contain your assessment of your contribution to the field. In this part of the research process, you are likely 2 For\n\nexample, ‘All two bedroom flats in Mayfair are more expensive than all two bedroom flats in Leytonstone’.\n\n3 For example, ‘The flat that suits me best among those whose details have been sent is Number 10 Railway Cuttings’.\n\nThe Research Journey: Four Steps to Success\n\n11\n\nto return to your review of current thinking that you made at the outset and reassess it in the light of your results. It’s as if the current thinking in your field of study is a partially complete jigsaw puzzle and you are detecting where your own new piece of the jigsaw fits in. Relating the outcomes of your research to current thinking in the field may simply involve showing how it adds to what is already known in the field. This would be the case when you have filled a gap in the literature or found a solution to a particular problem in the field. It may involve seeking connections with current thinking. It may involve challenging some parts of the map of the current thinking in the field, so that you will be proposing some reconstruction of that map. It may involve testing the consistency of your research findings with current thinking. It may involve asking ‘What if?’ questions of your research findings. Any of these ways of relating your research findings to current thinking in the field may present further questions and new avenues to explore. Successful research usually answers some questions but also raises new ones. It enables researchers to ask questions that would not have been asked before the research. New questions can be an important outcome of research. It is small wonder, therefore, that the final chapter of most research reports has a section containing suggestions for further research. A good practical question to ask yourself is ‘What are the implications of my research results for our understanding in this area?’ The implications can take many forms. Here are a few:\n\nr You may have filled a gap in the literature. r You may have produced a possible solution to an identified problem in the field. r Your results may challenge accepted ideas in the field (some earlier statements\n\nin the literature may seem less plausible in the light of your findings). r Some earlier statements in the literature may seem more plausible in the light of your findings. r Your work may help to clarify and specify the precise areas in which existing ideas apply and where they do not apply (it may help you to identify domains of application of those ideas). r Your results may suggest a synthesis of existing ideas. r You may have provided a new perspective on existing ideas in the field. r Your work may suggest new methods for researching your topic. r Your results may suggest new ideas, perhaps some new lines of investigation in the field. r You may have generated new questions in the field. r There may be implications for further research. Most of all, this last stage in the research process is about seeking to integrate the fruits of your own research with current thinking in the field.\n\nSummary and conclusions It is sometimes difficult to keep in mind the whole research journey when all of your attention is focussed on crossing some particularly difficult ground. Our purpose in this chapter is to help you to keep the whole research process in perspective when you are engaged in a particular research activity. We have done this by giving you an overview map on which the whole journey is plotted in outline. We hope this will help you to plan your research journey.\n\n12\n\nResearch Methods for Postgraduates\n\nWe have related the process of research to the way that you find information needed for the larger decisions in your life. You already have much experience to draw upon in planning and performing your research. We have suggested a four-part research process: (1) reviewing the field, (2) building theory, (3) testing theory and (4) reflecting and integrating. There is a considerable diversity of approaches to research in different fields, but this fourpart framework is sufficiently broad to encompass most research in the sciences, the social sciences and the humanities. Much of the literature on research focusses on different parts of the process. For example, in the social sciences it usually focusses on theory building, whereas in other sciences it may focus on theory testing. Your four parts may not follow this sequence strictly. For example, after you have reviewed the literature, you may want to monitor developments in current thinking while you are collecting and analysing data. You may engage in some parts of the research process more than once. For example, you may find that data you collect for theory building enables you to test statements found in the literature. Or data collected to test a theory may suggest a new theory so that it becomes an element of theory building. When you finally present your research, it will probably be presented as a structured linear process through the four activities discussed, but that certainly doesn’t mean you have to do them in just this order. In particular, published literature has a habit of accelerating in your field just when you are getting on with data analysis, so you need to keep it under review until your conclusions are clear. You may not want to spend the same amount of time and energy on each of the four parts of the process. For example, theory building may be only a token part of your research project if your main contribution lies in testing a theory that you found in the literature. On the other hand, you may direct most of your effort towards theory building, so that theory testing may be little more than establishing the plausibility of your theory in the light of the data you’ve collected. The four parts will be present in almost all research projects, at least conceptually. If one of the four parts seems to be missing from your own research project, you should discuss it with other researchers and, if you are registered for a research degree, with your supervisor. If you intend to omit one of the parts from your own research project, you must be able to state clearly why it has no role.\n\nReferences Jankowitz, A.D. (1991). Business Research for Students.

To do that, you need to undertake a research project which makes an original contribution to knowledge and understanding in your field. In striving to make that contribution, you will of course have the support of your supervisory team, academic colleagues in the field, and fellow doctoral candidates. But ultimately the responsibility is yours. You may have to create the project; you will certainly have to do the research and make an original contribution; you will have to present it in an appropriate form for examination; you will have to defend it at a viva; and, if you do all of these things successfully, you will be awarded the degree and gain the title of Dr. Doing all of these things is difficult enough, but you also have to do them within what, by historical standards, is a relatively short time period. Until a few years ago, the prevailing view was that, because doctorates involved making an original contribution to the field, they could not be constrained by time and took as long as they took (see e.g. Taylor, 2014). But candidates are now under intense pressures from research sponsors, academic departments, supervisors, families and in many cases bank managers to complete within three or four years in the cases of full-time candidates (or six or seven years part-time). The purpose or aim of this section of the book is to help you to think about how you are going to go about managing your doctorate. With that in mind, the objectives are to consider:\n\nr how to approach and start your doctorate; r how to plan it; r how to organise it; r how to manage your research project; r how to manage your relationship with your supervisory team; Research Methods for Postgraduates, Third Edition.

Hopefully, thinking about these topics will help you to improve your chances of finishing on time and gaining the degree.\n\nApproaching and Starting Your Doctorate If you are thinking about doing a doctorate, it makes sense to firstly enquire about precisely what you are letting yourself in for. In other words, what is a doctorate? The answer depends crucially upon two things; the sort of doctorate you are undertaking and how the standards are defined. Doctorates can be divided into four main types: professional doctorates which usually involve completing a substantial taught component and producing a thesis or portfolio which contributes to practice in the relevant field (see e.g. Kott and Hendel, 2011); practice-based doctorates which involve the production of an artefact (e.g. sculptures, paintings or musical pieces) accompanied by an exegesis of the process and the contribution to the artistic form (see e.g. Paltridge et al., 2011); doctorates by publication which include papers published in journals with a linking commentary (see e.g. Sharmini et al., 2014); and the traditional PhD which involves submitting a thesis. The requirements for each are different, and it is important that you establish the appropriate ones for your degree. The second factor is the definition of the standards for the degree. In many Western European countries, doctorates are defined in law and there are common standards. But in other countries, including Australia, the United Kingdom and the United States, there is not: it is up to individual institutions to define the standards (see e.g. Tinkler and Jackson, 2004; Pearce, 2005). So you need to consult your institution’s definition of the standards for doctorates, which will usually be found in its regulations and may well be included in your postgraduate handbook. While there will be variations, there should be the common elements that the research part of the doctorate:\n\nr should be on a specified and approved topic; r should constitute a substantial piece of research; r should make an original contribution in the relevant domains of scholarship and/or practice; and\n\nr should have been disseminated or should be worthy in principle of dissemination to the relevant research and, where appropriate, practice communities. These common elements would be fine if there were standard definitions of substantial, original contribution or worthy of dissemination. In practice, they can be interpreted in different ways. So, to take the PhD for example, at one extreme a doctorate can be seen as a multi-volume exhaustive account of a subject, opening up new vistas in the discipline, and ready to go into proof as a major book; at the other, it may be seen as the application of an intensive research training to produce a narrow account of a detailed aspect of a phenomenon and leading to two or three papers in specialised journals.\n\nManaging Your Doctorate\n\n15\n\nIf, then, the nature of the beast is contested, what can you do? By far, the best strategy is to look up a few successful doctoral submissions recently undertaken in a cognate area to that which you are considering researching, and ask yourself:\n\nr Were they on ‘big’ topics or relatively narrow ones? r Did they involve a massive amount of detailed research, or was this limited and narrowly focussed?\n\nr Did they aim to open up broad new fields of knowledge or push the barriers out slightly in a tightly defined area?\n\nr What made them, in whole or part, publishable? Once you have done this, it can be very useful indeed to discuss examples with your supervisory team both to clarify matters in your own mind and to ensure that there is a shared understanding of what exactly is involved in your doctorate. With that established, you can move on to your research topic. Many doctoral students in the sciences and engineering are recruited to undertake a specific piece of research which has been planned by their supervisors (i.e. they can step into a ready-made research project). But others, particularly in the arts, humanities and social sciences, start with a broad proposal which has to be refined into a detailed one (i.e. create a research project). This can be a frustrating, difficult and demoralising experience, as your initial ideas and expectations often turn out to be too ambitious and you find yourself thrashing around in an intellectual vacuum and moving from the macro level of your subject through the meta and so to the micro level in the search for a topic (see e.g. Kiley, 2009). You should, however, receive strong support at this stage from your supervisory team, who should act as a sounding board for your ideas and give you the benefit of their experience. With their assistance, you should eventually come up with a topic which is:\n\nr viable – can be undertaken with available or specified obtainable resources, including the human one of a supervisory team with relevant experience and expertise in the area, as well as material ones such as library, computing facilities, labs and so on; r ethical – meets relevant ethical guidelines set by institutions, disciplines and research sponsors; r doable – can be done by someone with your knowledge and skills or with specified additions to these and within the time available; r sustainable – will hold your interest and maintain your commitment over three or four years (or the part-time equivalent); r original – has the potential to make an original contribution to knowledge and/or practice and/or culture; r publishable – leads to publication or other forms of dissemination among the relevant research, practice or cultural communities; and r acceptable – conforms otherwise to the requirements and standards likely to be applied by examiners in the discipline. While it is never possible to guarantee the outcome of the research project – if the latter was known, the research would by definition not be original – it cannot be stressed enough that both you and your supervisory team must be reasonably satisfied on all of these counts before you proceed.\n\nResearch Methods for Postgraduates\n\n16\n\nPlanning Your Research Project One of the key themes of the literature on managing research projects (Gattrell, 2006; Watts, 2008; Phillips and Pugh, 2010) is the need to plan. This is because planning: Enables you to allocate time to your studies – Completing a doctorate fulltime within three or four years is challenging; completing one part-time is even more so because candidates often have jobs and family responsibilities as well, so that doctoral study is likely to be their second or third priority (see McCulloch and Stokes, 2008; Gardner and Gopaul, 2012). Whether full- or part-time, it is vital that you try to allocate time over the course of your studies to work on the doctorate. Enables you to allocate the right amount of time to each stage – As will be seen, all doctorates involve undertaking a number of tasks within the time that is available, and clearly it is important that you allocate an appropriate time length to each task. If you don’t do this, then you can spend considerably more time than you have available on particular parts of the thesis and not enough on others, which can be to the detriment of completion and of the quality of the final product. Helps to maintain your direction – One of the benefits of planning is that you know where you are, where you have been and where you are going. This gives you a more business-like approach to your work and can also, as Cryer (2006: 130) puts it, give you a sense of security. Supplies evidence of progress – A plan supplies evidence of progress to others, for example to your supervisory team or to the panel which is considering your ‘stepping up’ from initial to full candidacy, usually towards the end of the first year of your studies. Enables concerns to be externalised – A plan enables you to externalise concerns about progress by discussing them with your supervisory team and peers rather than internalising them and chasing them round endlessly in your own mind. Provides a basis for reflection – Finally, a plan provides a basis for reflection on your progress and, if necessary, for rescheduling. If, then, there are significant benefits to planning your doctorate, the next question concerns how to go about planning it. As in planning any project, this involves trying to answer the two questions of: what am I going to do (tasks)? And when am I going to do it (time)?\n\nWhat Am I Going to Do? While doctorates vary hugely in their structures and format and in how they are undertaken, most involve the 10 components of:\n\nr reviewing and evaluating general and specific literary and other sources in the area of the topic;\n\nManaging Your Doctorate\n\n17\n\nr identifying the gap, problem, issue, conflict or other trigger for the research, and formulating appropriate investigations, potential solutions, questions, theories and alternative interpretations; r deciding upon an appropriate paradigm, conceptual framework or methodology within which to conduct the research; operationalising concepts, theories and hypotheses; determining statistical procedures and significance levels before undertaking survey or experimental work; and so on; r where appropriate, obtaining appropriate ethical clearances for the research and determining intellectual property rights (see Chapter 5); r undertaking the substantive research, involving one or a combination of: ◦ reading original documents, ◦ subject interviewing, ◦ elite interviewing, ◦ mass interviewing, ◦ scientific fieldwork, ◦ scientific experimentation, ◦ problem solving, and ◦ computer modelling; r sifting, checking and analysing material; r interpreting findings and results, and assessing their implications for the initial focus of the inquiry; r reformulating the field of knowledge in the light of your findings; r summarising what your research has achieved, how it has been achieved, what conclusions have been reached and, if appropriate, directions for future research; and r writing the drafts of your thesis. These, then, are the core components – and there may be more, depending upon the topic – which will define your tasks over the next few years.\n\nWhen Am I Going to Do It? While it is difficult at the start of your research to assign precise time values to each of these components and some, of course, may overlap, you should, in conjunction with your supervisory team, try to plan a schedule for completing the stages of the research within a reasonable time limit. So you may, for example, plan in outline to spend the first six months refining the topic, reviewing and evaluating the literature, dealing with methodological questions and obtaining ethical clearances; 18 months undertaking the substantive research; three months analysing, interpreting and reformulating; and three months gluing the whole together, writing your summary and conclusions and finally polishing the thesis for submission. Then, with these broad boundaries in place, you may be able to break up the components into sub-components and try to set targets for their completion. It is absolutely vital that, in specifying time for each of the components of the research, you make a clear allocation for writing up that part of your work and linking it to what has\n\n18\n\nResearch Methods for Postgraduates\n\ngone before. This, as a number of studies (Kamler and Thompson, 2006; Badley, 2009; Wolff, 2010) have shown, is critical for five reasons:\n\nr it gets you straight into the habit of writing rather than leaving this until the end, when it can be difficult to acquire;\n\nr it encourages you to reflect upon what you have done before you go on and may highlight problems/avenues of exploration;\n\nr it provides a continuing record of your achievements so far; r it enables your supervisory team and university progress panels to see exactly what you have done and advise you how to proceed; and\n\nr if you write throughout, you build up a portfolio of your work, which you can then fashion into the shape of the final thesis rather than face the beginning from scratch to assemble your submission. Planning, then, can have considerable benefits. But it is important to note that plans should be frameworks and not cages. Given that a research project is ultimately concerned with making an original contribution to knowledge and/or practice, it obviously involves a creative process. As the research unfolds and new discoveries are made which lead off in different directions, plans have to be modified and changed, often in major ways. It is for this reason that, in many universities, the precise title of the thesis is left until just before final submission.\n\nOrganising Your Research With an outline of a realistic plan in place, you now have to decide how you are going to try to meet it in an organised way. This involves organising your time, your working conditions and your materials.\n\nTime At the start of a research degree, three, four (or, in the case of part-time students, six) years can seem a very long time away, and you may think that there is little or no urgency in progressing your studies. But, as Kearns et al. (2008) have pointed out, it is all too easy to procrastinate and waste time, leading to delays in the research project. In order to avoid this, you need to actively manage your time. This involves:\n\nr setting realistic tasks for the week ahead; r prioritising them; r timetabling them; r reviewing whether you have achieved them; and r where appropriate, planning how to catch up. Such active time management is vital if you are to complete your research on time.\n\nManaging Your Doctorate\n\n19\n\nWorking Conditions Research can be very demanding, and you need an appropriate working environment where you can read, reflect, think, evaluate and write. You need:\n\nr office space, preferably within the department where you are based, with designated maximum numbers;\n\nr necessary equipment, with a minimum of a desk, chair, lamp, bookcase and lockable filing cabinet;\n\nr where appropriate, a carrel in the library or bench space in the laboratory; r access to computing facilities, preferably ones dedicated to postgraduate use; r private common space for you to study when necessary on your own; and r access to the departmental staff common room and to the postgraduate common room for social purposes. Preferably before signing up for a doctorate, you should ensure that these facilities are available to you. If there are deficiencies, you should bring these to the attention of your department as factors which are likely to delay the completion of your research.\n\nMaterials In the course of your doctorate, you can expect to accumulate a vast amount of materials relating to your research, and it is important that you organise these properly. There is nothing worse than writing up your work, finding that you cannot trace the precise source of that key point or that your reference is inadequate and having to interrupt the flow while you try to find the original and sort it out. You should:\n\nr decide with your supervisory team which referencing system you will use in your thesis and note the exact requirements for footnotes or endnotes and for your bibliography;\n\nr assume anything that you read may eventually be cited and take full details of the reference. A master list of these should be stored in an electronic database, for example Endnote, which can then later be manipulated and sorted to form your bibliography; r establish a filing system and file your materials under appropriate headings (this may be manual or computerised, but in the latter case copies must be backed up regularly); and r index your filing system so that it is easy to find any document. Organising your material in this way should mean the minimum of delay while you are completing your work, and hence the least interruption to your creative flow.\n\nManaging Your Research Many students starting off on their research projects assume that, once they have settled upon a topic, the rest will flow seamlessly until they complete their research. This is entirely understandable because so many of us presume that the way that research is undertaken is as\n\nResearch Methods for Postgraduates\n\n20\n\nit is set out in journal articles and in books. However, published work, as Martin (1992: 2) has put it in the science context: present[s] a mythical reconstruction of what actually happened. All of what are in retrospect mistaken ideas, badly designed experiments, and incorrect calculations are omitted. The paper presents the research as if it is carefully thought out, planned and executed according to a neat rigorous process.\n\nSo what is finally published is usually only the tip of the iceberg; the nine-tenths of sometimes barren blood, sweat, toil and tears is hidden. Except in very rare cases, research is inherently a messy business, and many things can and do go wrong. Challenges can include:\n\nr Maintaining the focus of the research – As the research progresses, highways and byways of new exploration open up which just have to be investigated because they could be vital to the outcome. So every avenue is investigated until you become lost in the maze of possibilities and unable to find your way back to where you should be at that stage of the project. r Coming to grips with theoretical and methodological challenges – Research can require you to grapple with a whole range of new and difficult philosophical, theoretical, empirical and experimental challenges. As Kiley (2015) has shown, it can require a major effort to try to identify, tackle and resolve these, particularly when you are really itching to undertake the substantive research. r Frustration with the outcomes – You can expect a range of challenges as you undertake the substantive research. As Newsome (2008: 17)1 has put it for the case of chemistry: Scientific research often entails repeating the same experiment many times. This can be a frustrating and stressful process. The desirable results could take weeks or months to produce as the success rate is often low, but the researcher is necessarily working to a deadline. Serendipity as well as skill and experience reduce the time it takes. But even with both on his or her side, the researcher cannot predict how long it will take to get a desirable result. This makes planning difficult. Relying on equipment and machinery that may not always be in service exacerbates these issues…. [Students] expressed that they had not anticipated the reality at the start of their PhD (most PhD students will not have undertaken primary research before).\n\nr Inconsistencies in results – With the substantive research accomplished, you experience difficulties in analysing and interpreting it – evidence which is contradictory, experiments which yield unexpected results, cast-iron assumptions which are apparently falsified, equations which should be stable but turn out to be unstable, simulation results which defy predictions, variables which behave badly and so on. 1 From\n\nThe Chemistry PhD: the impact on women’s retention, reproduced by permission of the Royal Society of Chemistry and the UK Resource Centre for Women in SET.\n\nManaging Your Doctorate\n\n21\n\nBut, if you can’t avoid one or more of these challenges, part of becoming an independent researcher is learning how to manage them. You can try to do this by:\n\nr Acknowledging the existence of a problem – As an undergraduate or master’s student, you may have sailed through with effortless brilliance, and it can be an immense shock to encounter challenges of the kinds outlined here; acknowledging them can be seen as weakness or failure (see Lovitts, 2005). So you may not feel like telling anybody that you are experiencing problems, perhaps least of all your supervisory team. But such problems are experienced throughout virtually the entire research community, and admission should not be conceived of as a weakness, but as a strength. So, if you feel that you are falling behind, acknowledge that there is a problem, reflect upon the reasons why and try to identify a solution. r Seeking help – If you can’t quite define the problem or can’t find a solution, seek help. You might initially explain the problem to a fellow student, preferably one more advanced in his or her studies, or if appropriate a post-doc – often they have experienced similar problems and will be able to help you out. If you are still blocked, go to see your supervisors, tell them that you are stuck, tell them why and ask them for suggestions. They may not have answers – after all, you are the emerging expert in your field – but they should support you to find a way forward.\n\nManaging Your Relationship with Your Supervisory Team Normally, you will be supervised by a team consisting of a principal or main supervisor or director of studies and at least one second supervisor. They will be your guides and mentors over the course of your doctorate, and it is important that you establish and maintain a good relationship with them. One thing that you need to do right at the start is to sort out what you can expect from your supervisory team and what they can expect from you. Studies (see e.g. Meyer et al., 2007; Engebretson et al., 2008; Stubb et al., 2014) suggest that a mismatch of expectations is one of the principal causes of frustration on the part of both candidates and supervisors, and it can lead to delays in progressing the project. Your supervisory team may well ask you to complete one of the standard questionnaires on expectations (see e.g. Hair, 2006; Lee, 2011) and discuss it with them, and/or take you through the relevant section of your institution’s postgraduate handbook concerned with the responsibilities of the parties and/or negotiate a learning agreement. The important thing is that you are clear about what you can expect from each other in the relationship. But that relationship is not static, and it should change over time. At the beginning of the project, you may well need high levels of both academic and personal support from your supervisory team to help you to get started on the research project and to enable you to undertake it. As the project proceeds, however, you should take hold of the reins more and more as you develop into an independent researcher. Towards the end, you may need high levels of support again as you create drafts of your final submission and rely heavily upon your supervisory team for feedback on whether it is acceptable and will meet the standard for the award. However, these adjustments may not happen automatically, with supervisors sometimes being unwilling to cut candidates the slack to do things on their own or candidates sometimes being reluctant to embrace opportunities for independent work. Neither of these states of\n\n22\n\nResearch Methods for Postgraduates\n\naffairs is healthy – in the former the candidate can feel stifled, and in the latter the supervisory team can despair of the candidate ever flying the nest – and it is important that issues are addressed. For that reason, it can be helpful for you and your supervisory team to have regular discussions not just about the progress of your research, but also about the progress of the relationship, perhaps using the tool developed by Gurr (2001) for that purpose. As surveys (see e.g. Bennett and Turner, 2013) have consistently shown, the vast majority of research students are very satisfied with the overall quality of supervision they receive, and the chances are statistically very high that you will have a good experience. But, in some cases, problems may arise including lack of interest in your research project, lack of time to give you effective supervision and disagreement within the supervisory team. Research students are a source of prestige and income to academic departments, and staff can be put under considerable pressure to take on students even if the topic of their proposed research is marginal to their interests and expertise. A supervisor without adequate knowledge of the topic can delay completion (see e.g. Jacobsonn, 2009; Wadesango and Machingambi, 2011) or, in extremis, even cost the candidate their degree. If you feel that your supervisory team does not have the expertise to offer you effective supervision, you should ask that alternative arrangements should be put in place – it is the responsibility of the institution which accepted you to ensure that your supervisory team is appropriately qualified in the field. Academic staff are under severe pressure to perform in research, teaching, service and administration, and time is at a premium (see Hammond et al., 2010). That said, many institutions now have supervisor workload policies which allow time for supervision, and there is no excuse for the occasional horror stories about students having meetings with supervisors in railway stations or airports or receiving feedback on their draft chapters months after they have been handed in. If a team agrees to supervise you, then they take on a commitment and should be prepared to fulfil it. So, if you are having problems, try to discuss them with your supervisory team. If this does not work, your institution will have procedures for raising issues or complaints with Directors of Postgraduate Studies, heads of departments, heads of graduate schools, or independent counsellors or ombudspersons (see Pearson, 2012), which should be set out in the graduate student handbook. In extreme cases, a new supervisory team may be the only way forward. While supervisory teams can have considerable advantages over single supervisors in terms of expertise, access and maintaining continuity (see e.g. Manathunga, 2012), they can also introduce an added complication in terms of potential disagreement between supervisors. Supervisors can be at odds in terms of intellectual traditions (particularly if they are from different disciplines or different strands within a discipline; see Guerin and Green, 2013), conceptions of the research project (particularly if drawn from academic and industrial backgrounds, respectively; see Malfoy, 2011) and supervisory styles (particularly if both are determined to direct the research project themselves; see Bui, 2014). As Gunnarsson et al. (2013) have pointed out, such disagreements can leave students trying to satisfy everybody but actually satisfying no one and delaying the research. So you need to be alert to signs of explicit or implicit disagreement between your supervisors and, as far as possible, ensure that they are discussed and resolved as early as possible in the research project. If differences persist, and you continue to find yourself the ‘piggy in the middle’, then it may be worth taking this up with the appropriate person in your department or institution.\n\nManaging Your Doctorate\n\n23\n\nManaging Yourself In addition to managing your thesis and your relationship with your supervisor over the course of your studies, you also have to manage yourself (i.e. cope with the slings and arrows of life as a researcher). These can include initial adjustment, isolation and loneliness, and mid-thesis crisis.\n\nInitial Adjustment In the taught programmes you took as an undergraduate or taught postgraduate, knowledge was pedagogically processed, packaged and controlled so that it ‘works’. But, as Delamont et al. (2000) have pointed out, there is a world of difference between following intellectual paths which have been well trodden by others and blazing a new trail across the landscape. Things can and do go wrong, it can be a frightening experience and it is not unknown for postgraduates in their first few months to feel as if they have been left up the creek without a paddle. While a few years ago, this period was regarded as one you had to survive to progress, institutions now offer help in the form of comprehensive induction programmes which are designed to support students to adjust. Also supervisors are now placing greater emphasis upon the need to support candidates during this critical period, and some institutions have established ‘buddying’ schemes whereby candidates further on in their research support new ones. So, if you do feel lost and adrift, you are by no means alone, and you can seek and expect support to help you to adjust to postgraduate life.\n\nIsolation and Loneliness One of the most consistent findings of the literature on research students over the past three decades or more (see e.g. Rudd, 1985; Becher et al., 1994; Gardener, 2009; Janta et al., 2012; McAlpine, 2013) is the extent to which they can suffer from isolation, both intellectually and/or socially. An element of isolation may be inherent in studying for a research degree; you are required to make an independent and original contribution to knowledge and understanding, which implies that the work must be undertaken on your own. That said, there is a difference between working on your own but with support from your supervisors and possibly other members of the research team and fellow graduate students and working in an almost complete intellectual and social vacuum. Perhaps the candidates most vulnerable to the extreme of isolation are the ‘lone scholars’ in the arts, humanities and social sciences ploughing their own furrows often at a remove from the interests of their supervisors or fellow doctoral candidates. But even students working in research groups in the laboratory sciences can feel isolated (see UK Resource Centre for SET and Royal Society of Chemistry and Biochemical Society, 2009), while part-time students in all disciplines may also suffer because of their geographical remoteness from the university and fellow students (see Gattrell, 2006; McCulloch and Stokes, 2008; Gardner and Gopaul, 2012). Such isolation can lead to or reinforce mental health issues which can beset doctoral students (Hopwood et al., 2011; Else, 2015).\n\nResearch Methods for Postgraduates\n\n24\n\nHere Cryer’s (2006) advice is pertinent, that you actively need to take steps to ward off isolation. Examples of ways to do this include:\n\nr using social media to keep in active touch with supervisors, colleagues and your department; r participating in mentoring schemes whereby a graduate or a more advanced doctoral student is teamed with a less advanced one;\n\nr joining journal clubs or writing groups with fellow students; r playing a part in departmental and/or graduate school academic and social activities; and r participating in the postgraduate sections of subject associations. Mid-thesis Crisis You commence your project all bright-eyed and bushy-tailed at the apparently glamourous prospect of undertaking original research. But, perhaps a year to 18 months into the research project, the glamour can begin to wear off as you begin to lose your sense of direction, feel overwhelmed by what little you seem to have done and by how much is left to be done, suffer loss of confidence or are bored out of your mind by the endless grind. In consequence, as a number of commentators (see e.g. Delamont et al., 2004; Cryer, 2006; Phillips and Pugh, 2010; R"
