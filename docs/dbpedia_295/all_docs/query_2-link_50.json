Slurries, middlings and other low-grade coal products, which cannot be classified according to the type of coal from which they are obtained, are included under hard coal. There are two sub-categories of hard coal: (i) coking coal and (ii) other bituminous coal and anthracite (also known as steam coal). Coking coal is a hard coal with a quality that allows the production of coke suitable to support a blast furnace charge. Steam coal is coal used for steam raising and space heating purposes and includes all anthracite coals and bituminous coals not classified as coking coal.\n\nLignite:\n\nOne of the two sub-categories of brown coal. Brown coal is coal with a low degree of coalification which retained the anatomical structure of the vegetable matter from which it was formed. It has a mean random reflectance of vitrinite of less than 0.6, provided that the gross calorific value (on a moist ash-free basis) is less than 23,865 KJ/kg (5,700 kcal/kg). Brown coal comprises: (i) lignite - non-agglomerating coals with a gross calorific value less than 17,435 KJ/kg (4,165 kcal/kg) and greater than 31 per cent volatile matter on a dry mineral matter free basis and (ii) sub-bituminous coal - non-agglomerating coals with a gross calorific value between 17,435 KJ/kg (4,165 kcal/kg) and 23,865 KJ/kg (5,700 kcal/kg) containing more than 31 per cent volatile matter on a dry mineral matter free basis.\n\nPeat:\n\nA solid fuel formed from the partial decomposition of dead vegetation under conditions of high humidity and limited air access (initial stage of coalification). Only peat used as fuel is included. Its principal use is as a household fuel.\n\nPatent fuel (hard coal briquettes):\n\nA composition fuel manufactured from coal fines by shaping with the addition of a binding agent such as pitch.\n\nLignite briquettes:\n\nA composition fuel manufactured from lignite. The lignite is crushed, dried and molded under high pressure into an even shaped briquette without the addition of binders.\n\nPeat briquettes:\n\nA composition fuel manufactured from peat. Raw peat, after crushing and drying, is molded under high pressure into an even-shaped briquette without the addition of binders.\n\nCoke:\n\nThe solid residue obtained from coal or lignite by heating it to a high temperature in the absence or near absence of air. It is high in carbon and low in moisture and volatile matter. Several categories are distinguished:\n\na) Coke-oven coke - The solid product obtained from carbonization of coal, principally coking coal, at high temperature. Coke-oven coke is also called metallurgical coke and is used mainly in the iron and steel industry. Semi-coke, the solid product obtained from carbonization of coal at low temperature, is included with coke-oven coke. It is used mainly as a domestic fuel.\n\nb) Gas coke - A by-product of coal used for the production of gas works gas in gasworks. Gas coke is mainly used as a domestic fuel.\n\nc) Brown coal coke - A solid product obtained from carbonization of brown coal briquettes.\n\nOil shale:\n\nA sedimentary rock containing a high proportion of organic matter (kerogen), which can be converted to crude oil or gas by heating.\n\nBituminous sands:\n\nSands or sandstones containing a high proportion of tarry hydrocarbons, capable of yielding oil through heating or other extractive processes. Heavy oils and tars which are so dense and viscous and lacking in primary energy that they cannot be produced commercially by conventional methods, that is, by natural flow or pumping, are also included.\n\nLIQUID FUELS\n\nback to top\n\nCrude oil:\n\nA mineral oil consisting of a mixture of hydrocarbons of natural origin, yellow to black in color, of variable density and viscosity. Data in this category also includes lease or field condensate (separator liquids) which is recovered from gaseous hydrocarbons in lease separation facilities, as well as synthetic crude oil, mineral oils extracted from bituminous minerals such as shales and bituminous sand, and oils from coal liquefaction.\n\nNatural gas liquids (NGL):\n\nLiquid or liquefied hydrocarbons produced in the manufacture, purification and stabilization of natural gas. NGL's include, but are not limited to, ethane, propane, butane, pentane, natural gasolene, and plant condensate. NGL's are either distilled with crude oil in refineries, blended with refined petroleum products or used directly depending on their characteristics.\n\nPlant condensate:\n\nLiquid hydrocarbons condensed from wet natural gas in natural gas processing plants. It is used as a petroleum refinery input.\n\nNatural gasolene:\n\nLight spirit extracted from wet natural gas, often in association with crude petroleum.

As far as possible the series include fuels consumed in refining, but exclude oil products obtained from natural gas, coal, lignite and their derivatives.\n\nAviation gasolene:\n\nMotor spirit prepared especially for aviation piston engines, with an octane number varying from 80 to 145 RON and a freezing point of -60°C.\n\nMotor gasolene:\n\nLight hydrocarbon oil for use in internal combustion engines such as motor vehicles, excluding aircraft. It distills between 35°C and 200°C, and is treated to reach a sufficiently high octane number of generally between 80 and 100 RON.

It is obtained by blending kerosene and gasolene or naphtha in such a way that the aromatic content does not exceed 25% in volume. Additives are included to reduce the freezing point to -58°C or lower, and to keep the Reid vapour pressure between 0.14 and 0.21 kg/cm2.\n\nKerosene-type jet fuel:\n\nMedium oil for use in aviation gas-turbine engines with the same distillation characteristics and flash point as kerosene, with a maximum aromatic content of 20% in volume. It is treated to give a kinematic viscosity of less than 15 cSt at -34°C and a freezing point below -50°C.\n\nKerosene:\n\nMedium oil distilling between 150°C and 300°C; at least 65% of volume distills at 250°C.

Its flash point is always above 50°C and its specific gravity is higher than 0.82. Heavy oils obtained by blending are grouped together with gas oils on the condition that their kinematic viscosity does not exceed 27.5 cSt at 38°C. Also included are middle distillates intended for the petrochemical industry. Gas-diesel oils are used as a fuel for internal combustion in diesel engines, as a burner fuel in heating installations, such as furnaces, and for enriching water gas to increase its luminosity.

It is commonly used by ships and industrial large-scale heating installations as a fuel in furnaces or boilers.\n\nLiquefied petroleum gas (LPG):\n\nHydrocarbons which are gaseous under conditions of normal temperature and pressure but are liquefied by compression or cooling to facilitate storage, handling and transportation. They are (i) extracted by stripping of natural gas at crude petroleum and natural gas sources; (ii) extracted by stripping of imported natural gas in installations of the importing country; and (iii) produced both in refineries and outside of refineries in the course of processing crude petroleum or its derivatives. It comprises propane (C3H8), butane (C4H10), or a combination of the two. Also included is ethane (C2H6) from petroleum refineries or natural gas producers' separation and stabilization plants.\n\nRefinery gas:\n\nNon-condensable gas obtained during distillation of crude oil or treatment of oil products (e.g. cracking) in refineries.

Naphtha may be further blended or mixed with other materials to make high-grade motor gasolene or jet fuel, or may be used as a raw material for manufactured gas. Naphtha is sometimes used as input to feedstocks to make various kinds of chemical products, or may be used as a solvent.\n\nWhite spirit/industrial spirit:\n\nA highly refined distillate with a boiling point ranging from 135°C to 200°C, which is used as a paint solvent and for dry-cleaning purposes.\n\nLubricants:\n\nViscous, liquid hydrocarbons rich in paraffin waxes, distilling between 380oC and 500oC, obtained by vacuum distillation of oil residues from atmospheric distillation.
