        "text": "I missed an important anniversary this year.\n\nIt happened at 8.12pm on September 22nd. I can’t even remember what I was doing. I might have been having my head looked at. The memory’s a bit vague. Maybe that explains a lot.\n\nIt was the kind of anniversary that, if you’re in the ad game, at least warranted a slight celebration. Maybe even a few fireworks. Definitely a raising of the odd glass or three.\n\nThe occasion? At that time…on that day…in 1955…the first ever advert was televised on UK TV, on the new ITV network.\n\nThere are still some who wish it had been the last.\n\nIt won the spot by coming first in a competition. There were 23 other ads in the running, including ones for Guinness, Surf, National Benzole, Brown & Polson Custard, and Summer County Margarine.\n\nViewers saw a tube of toothpaste embedded in a block of ice, to the slogan: “It’s tingling fresh. It’s fresh as ice. It’s Gibbs SR toothpaste.”\n\nCatchy, eh?\n\nI was four years old and, by all accounts, a right little bugger. If my parents saw the ad at all, it would have been on a screen smaller than my iPad.\n\nIt would have been in black and white.\n\nI would have been in bed and asleep.\n\nFast forward sixty years and I’ve just finished watching a gaggle of the latest feel-good Christmas ads on my very large flat screen telly.\n\nAfter all this time, it seems the odour of stiff competition is still in the air.\n\nLeading the pack was Man On The Moon, the new John Lewis offering, sponsored by Age UK, which has inspired thousands to volunteer to help the elderly during the festive season. Fetch the tissues!\n\nI thought it was a dead cert winner. Until I saw the Sainsbury’s “Mog” ad.\n\nAccompanying this is a new book about Mog’s Christmas adventures, and all profits are being donated to a Save The Children-led campaign to help kids become better readers. Brilliant!\n\nNow all bets are off and Twitter is, apparently, going bonkers.\n\nHow many stuffed “Mog” soft toys Sainsbury’s will sell is anyone’s guess.\n\nLook out Sergei and Oleg.\n\nOne thing’s for sure, though.\n\nJohn Lewis might not sell as many telescopes or lunar maps (if they even have any).\n\nBut they’ll still get my vote.\n\nFor some, their ad might come in a close creative second.\n\nBut I suspect more than a few old folk couldn’t give a damn.\n\nAs long as they’re not alone this Christmas…"
