        "text": "Smurfs were first sold in America in 1979. At first there was some difficulties in finding a company that would support foreign characters, because the Americans wanted something that their audience would recognise.\n\nHowever Wallace Berrie & Co acquired the North American licensing rights to the smurfs. This included using pre existing moulds from Bully and Schleich. Along with this they also started importing their own versions made in Hong Kong.\n\nAt the time most PVC toys would sell for roughly 25cents though Wallace Berrie took a gamble and started selling the smurf figurines for $1.50. The gamble paid off as the demand for smurfs was growing at a rapid rate.\n\nNot only smurf figurines were being sold, Wallace Berrie introduced all sorts of smurf merchandise to America. The next big thing after the smurf figurines was the demand for the soft toys (plush dolls). The sale of smurf comics was also taking off.\n\nOn 12 September 1981, the smurfs debuted on NBC and made a huge impact capturing 42% of the Saturday morning television audience. The cartoon series in turn would be sold throughout the world and is still something that holds close to a generation that grew up on Saturday morning television viewing.\n\nWhat is interesting to note that with the cartoon series, that any changes made to the smurf creations would have to be approved by Peyo.\n\nBetween 1979 and 1982 smurfs for America were being made in Hong Kong by Schleich. This served Schleich well because they were able to distrubute smurfs to Australia and New Zealand for BP promotions and America for Wallace Berrie.\n\nBy 1982 BP Australia no longer had the rights to smurfs in Australia and due to the high demand for smurfs in America, Wallace Berrie started to manufacture their own smurfs in Hong Kong.\n\nWith this Wallace Berrie also used their own reference numbers which was different to the existing Schleich reference numbers. This would later cause some head aches amongst collectors when trying to establish their own websites based on reference numbers.\n\nThey first started adding W.B.CO to the existing Hong Kong marked smurfs. Though before too long smurfs were being sold with Hong Kong W. Berrie markings.\n\nThere was also some smurfs that were only sold in America at this time and were never intended for the European market. Some of these included Baseball Catcher (20146) and Baseball Pitcher (20166)\n\nIn 1982 Wallace Berrie had acquired Applause division from Knickerbocker Toys and started adding Applause to the markings. Some have estimated at around this time that smurf merchandise was worth over $600 million.\n\nBy 1985 smurf sales were starting to decline. Wallace Berrie were selling their Limited Collector Series by selling two smurfs together. The last of these were Papa Pilot (20223) and Stewardess (20222) in August. It was around here this time that smurfs were no longer being made in Hong Kong.\n\nCome 1990 Applause (formerly known as Wallace Berrie) released their last 11 smurfs. These were all made in China.\n\nFor those of you who collect smurfs based on markings, there are potentially up to ten different W. Berrie markings to be found.\n\nThe other odd thing Wallace Berrie did briefly in 1982 is that they changed all the year markings to 1980. Though this was later changed back to the original year again. So it is not uncommon to find some smurfs with two different year markings.\n\nWhen looking back at this extraordinary time, Wallace Berrie sold more than 200 different regular smurfs and 50 different Supersmurfs. The question that begs to be asked is – Will we see smurfs rule the world like they once did?\n\nKeep on Smurfin\n\nKath B\n\nPromotional Smurfs are probably the most interesting smurfs to collect. Promotional Smurfs were made to promote a company or organisation. Some were licensed and some were not but that is what makes them so interesting to collect.\n\nGenerally Promotional Smurfs are smurfs that are generally found with the company/organisation’s name or logo imprinted onto the figurine. Though this has not always been the case.\n\nRegular Smurfs, Super Smurfs and Smurfs on pedestals have all been used as Promotional Smurfs. However it has been prominently been regular Smurfs.\n\nCompanies that have had Promotional Smurfs made for them include BP, McDonalds, Omo, Merkur Bank, Colgate, Schimmel Pianos, Schonwald Smurfs on pedestals and others.\n\nOrganisations that have had also used Promotional Smurfs made for them include Deutsches Rotes Kreuz (German Red Cross), ASB – Arbeiter Samariter Bund (Workers Samaritan Federation) and others.\n\nQuite often a Promotional Smurf was made using an existing mould and sometimes by adding a colour variation or adding different attachment to promote the company/organisation. This was particularly the case in the ones made in the 1980’s. Also generally these were released individually.\n\nIn the 1990’s fewer Promotional Smurfs were made, though for some of these new moulds were made. Also in the 1990’s we saw whole sets of Promotional Smurfs released.\n\nProbably the most well known ones released in the 1990’s were produced by McDonalds in 1996 and 1998 upon where each smurf had a “M” symbol embossed onto the back of their head.\n\nThe good thing Promotional Smurfs are still being made today. However not to the same degree as in the 1980’s when Promotional Smurfs were at their peak.\n\nLast year Schleich released three smurfs, to celebrate the 2014 World Cup Soccer. Two are based on New Soccer Smurf (20454) painted in the colours of Belgium and Holland also a Devil Smurf (20213).\n\nThere has always been some debate about some Promotional Smurfs and whether they are authorised or unauthorised. The lack of official records also adds to the confusion. However with the release of collector books and online forums/shops have helped overcome this as best as they can.\n\nFor me one of the things that makes Promotional Smurfs interesting is learning about the company or organisation. This always creates a point of interest and conversation for those who are not familiar with smurfs.\n\nSome collectors also find that by specialising in only collecting Promotional Smurfs can be very satisfying and in a way of having a collection within a collection.\n\nAnother reason why Promotional Smurfs have always been highly collectible is that for some there were only limited numbers produced or were only released in a particular country. This can result in pushing up the prices and creating some very sought after smurfs.\n\nThere are many different promotional Smurfs to collect, a few of them are listed here.\n\nKeep on Smurfin\n\nKath"
