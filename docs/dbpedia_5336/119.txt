Jo Gowda is an Indian born Australian stand up comic. RAW comedy finalist in 2019 and 2020, Jo will disarm you with her quick wit and cheeky sense of humour. She describes herself as Australia’s second best import (after cricket of course). Jo uses her humour to break barriers, shatter stereotypes and incite thought. You’ll find her humour relatable, amusing and sprinkled with dry wit.
