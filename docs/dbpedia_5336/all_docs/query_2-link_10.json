He was 88.\n\n“Bobby Dean was a warm and friendly and gentle soul who provided a sense of calm in what could be a hectic work environment,” former Daily Times sports editor Chic Riebel said. “He loved local sports, but the biggest part of his heart resided with the University of Texas Longhorns. I will always remember how excited he was when the office presented him with a burnt orange Texas jersey with the number 50 on it for his 50th birthday.”\n\n“Bob was an original, and kind to everyone, but I first heard that twang of his as a college freshman making a cold call for freelance work,” Daily Times sports editor Rob Parent said. “At least he passed my call on nicely then.\n\n“If you were to put together a sports staff at a local paper back then, you should start with somebody that could connect with the community. Bob Franklin might have been from Texas but he had no trouble connecting from the heart with anyone and everyone in Delaware County, Pa.”\n\nFranklin’s love for the Longhorns, both from the University of Texas and Bronte High School, was legendary. He followed both teams with a passion and was overjoyed when Bronte began streaming its games live. Any time he had a computer problem, he would call Beth Lippard, the daughter-in-law of his longtime companion, Peggy Lippard.\n\n“He would say, ‘Beth, you have to come over and fix my computer,'” Beth Lippard said. “‘I can’t watch my ballgame.'”\n\nFranklin graduated from Bronte High School and attended San Angelo Junior College and North Texas State University, where he majored in journalism. He began his career in journalism after a four-year stint in the United States Air Force.\n\nMr. Franklin came to the Daily Times from the Amarillo (Tx.) Daily News and quickly immersed himself in the community, covering high school and college sports. A gifted writer, it was his humor and warm personality that endeared him to so many. Franklin was quick with a joke and willing to help anyone in need.\n\n“When I started working part-time for the Daily Times, I worked with Ed Gebhart, Rich Wescott and Bob Franklin. Those were great times and they all helped me to learn to love working for the sports department,” said longtime writer and editor Harry Chaykun, now retired but still contributing to the newspaper’s sports section on a regular basis. “Bobby Dean always found a way to have fun and you laughed at so many of the things he did. … He was such a special person to be around and such a good friend.”\n\nAfter his retirement, Franklin moved to Lincolnton to be near Lippard, whom he met in 1989 and affectionately called “Miss Peggy.”\n\n“Bob was one of the kindest guys you’ll ever meet,” former Daily Times sports writer Doug Gramiak said.\n\nFranklin is survived by Lippard and her children and grandchildren, his sister Anne Ivy and brother William Franklin, along with several nieces and nephews. A memorial service will be held at 11 a.m. at the Warlick Funeral Home in Lincolnton, N.C.\n\nOriginally Published: August 8, 2019 at 5:04 p.m."
