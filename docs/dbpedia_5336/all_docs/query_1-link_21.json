        "text": "'MENTAL people,\" says comedian Bob Franklin, when asked who his fans are. \"The socially awkward, too. But it's hard to pin down a particular subsection. My audiences are just a through-line of mental instability.\"\n\nJust as hard to define is Franklin's unique comic style — and his accent.\n\nWatch series one and two of The Librarians free, right here.\n\n\"He's a brilliant joke writer,\" says comedian Tony Martin, \"but a lot of those jokes only work coming out of his mouth. You could never steal his material.\n\n\"If you ask [other comics] who their top 10 comedians are, you'll find that Bob is always on their list. I'm a massive fan, though I couldn't tell you quite where he's from. Is he Welsh? Is he English?\"\n\nIn fact, he's both: Franklin was born in England but grew up in Wales, which is why he sounds like a cockney Tom Jones. It's the perfect comedy accent — especially for shifty characters like Neil Slider, who worms his way back into the Middleton Interactive Learning Centre for the third season of The Librarians.\n\n\"He takes on the cleaning contract with his new girlfriend,\" Franklin says, warming himself with an instant coffee after filming at Moonee Valley Racecourse. \"He doesn't get around to cleaning anything but he's there.\"\n\nWhich brings even more angst to uptight head librarian, Frances O'Brien (Robyn Butler). As does her husband, Terry (Wayne Hope, also Butler's off-screen husband); a government directive that her library must turn a profit; and the impending gay wedding of one of her staff.\n\nThis season — again written and produced by Butler and Hope, with Hope directing six episodes and Tony Martin two — will take over the plum 8.30pm Wednesday slot on ABC1 normally occupied by Spicks and Specks. (And it's worth watching The Librarians in Profile with Sir Robert Franklin on YouTube, in which he methodically works his way through the cast, dispensing carefully considered insults.)\n\nFranklin first met Butler and Librarians co-star Roz Hammond on The Eric Bana Show Live in 1997 and was introduced to Hope the following year on the set of the mockumentary series Small Tales and True.\n\n\"We took it to other networks after it aired on the Comedy Channel,\" he says, \"and we were basically told that people wouldn't watch mockumentaries; that it was not a viable form. This was before The Office and Modern Family and Summer Heights High and now we have journalists saying, 'Oh, so you borrowed from those mockumentaries?' And you just go, 'Do your f---ing research.\"' With filming on The Librarians finished, Franklin will concentrate on getting funding for a film he's written.\n\n\"It's a parody of all the Elvis films from the '50s and '60s,\" he says. \"I've written and story-boarded the entire thing and hand-drawn 1400 panels, which took me the best part of a year.\n\n\"But funding bodies are very reluctant to fund someone who hasn't already directed a feature film. And of course, you can't direct a film without funding. It seems strange that they make films that try to please everyone, yet people won't go in huge numbers to an Australian film unless it's different, like Kenny or Chopper or Samson & Delilah. It can be a long and frustrating road.\"\n\nThe third season of The Librarians begins on Wednesday at 8.30pm on ABC1."
