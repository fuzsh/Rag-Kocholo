Whether it's a new Netflix special or a live performance in a packed arena, it's always a treat to see these talented ladies push boundaries with smart humor and razor-sharp commentary. For instance, Ali Wong's raw and unfiltered thoughts about motherhood are a breath of fresh air, and Michelle Wolf's take on controversial topics always packs a punch.\n\nThese are just two famous ladies who are dominating the comedy landscape right now. And while every person's style is quite different, we guarantee that each one will have you giggling nonstop. Keep scrolling for the 25 best female comedians.\n\n1. Wanda Sykes\n\nBest known for: The Upshaws, Curb Your Enthusiasm, The New Adventures of Old Christine\n\nThe Emmy-winning actress and writer is a legend in her own right, with dozens of acting credits and multiple comedy specials to her name. Known for her razor-sharp wit and blunt commentary, Wanda, 59, doesn’t shy away from controversial topics.\n\nAfter performing at several local venues, Sykes joined the writing team on The Chris Rock Show in 1997, which earned her an Emmy for Outstanding Writing for a Variety Series. Since then, she has appeared in shows and films like Monster-in-Law, Friendsgiving, Black-ish and, most recently, The Upshaws. Sykes also made headlines in 2022 after co-hosting the 94th Academy Awards with Regina Hall and Amy Schumer.\n\n2. Nicole Byer\n\nBest known for: Nailed It!, Girl Code\n\nNicole Byer has mastered the art of delivering the raunchiest jokes with such quirk and charm, it makes her delivery all the more hilarious. The 40-year-old comedian rose to fame through her 2013 series, Girl Code, before starring in Loosely Exactly Nicole from 2016 to 2018. She became the host of Netflix's hit baking show, Nailed It!, in 2018 and has since appeared in projects like The Good Place, Brooklyn Nine-Nine, Bad Hair and Valley Girl.\n\nIn December 2021, Byer dropped her first full-length special, called Nicole Byer: BBW (Big Beautiful Weirdo), on Netflix, and it scored her an Emmy nomination for Outstanding Writing for a Variety Special.

Ali Wong\n\nBest known for: Always Be My Maybe, Baby Cobra, Hard Knock Wife, Don Wong\n\nIf you want to pee your pants laughing, we highly recommend you watch one of Wong's Netflix specials, where she expertly blends humor and social commentary. The 41-year-old star started out as a cast member on ABC's American Housewife and appeared on shows like Inside Amy Schumer and Black Box. She also served as a writer for the first three seasons of Fresh Off the Boat.\n\nIn 2019, she starred in, co-wrote and produced the rom-com, Always Be My Maybe.

Quinta Brunson\n\nBest known for: Abbott Elementary, A Black Lady Sketch Show\n\nQuinta Brunson is making major strides in Hollywood, thanks in huge part to her hit ABC series, Abbott Elementary. But believe it or not, the 33-year-old actress was delivering laughs way before she created the series. She took the internet by storm in 2014, after her self-produced Instagram series, Girl Who Has Never Been on a Nice Date, went viral. Then, she joined Buzzfeed to work as a video producer.\n\nFast-forward to the present day, and Brunson has made history as the first Black woman to be nominated for three Emmys in the comedy category, including Outstanding Comedy Series (as an executive producer), Outstanding Lead Actress in a Comedy Series and Outstanding Writing for a Comedy Series, which she won.\n\n6. London Hughes\n\nBest known for: Laughter Shock, London Hughes: To Catch a D*ck, To Tell the Truth\n\nChances are you've spotted the British comedian on shows like Scrambled!, Fleabag and Newsjack.

Leslie Jones\n\nBest known for: Saturday Night Live, Ghostbusters, Coming 2 America\n\nOur favorite SNL queen served as a writer and starred in the NBC sketch comedy series from 2014 to 2019. Her role earned her two Emmy nods for Outstanding Supporting Actress in a Comedy Series—but that was just the beginning.\n\nLeslie Jones, 56, starred in the all-female reboot of Ghostbusters in 2016 and released an unforgettable stand-up special on Netflix called Time Machine. In 2021, she appeared in Coming 2 America alongside Eddie Murphy and Tracy Morgan. And currently, she's a guest host for The Daily Show.\n\n8.

In 2014, she released One of the Greats on Netflix, which, FYI, boasts a perfect score on Rotten Tomatoes. Since then, she’s made guest appearances in shows like New Girl, Girls and Search Party.\n\nIn 2020, Chelsea Peretti released an EP called Foam and Flotsam, a musical concept album about coffee.

Michelle Wolf\n\nBest known for: The Daily Show, Joke Show, The Break with Michelle Wolf\n\nWolf is the Jill of all trades.

Most recently, she released her third stand-up special, Michelle Wolf: It’s Great to Be Here, which includes a series of three 30-minute episodes on Netflix.\n\n10. Anjelah Johnson\n\nBest known for: MADtv, The Opening Act, The Resurrection of Gavin Stone\n\nFans of MADtv will remember Anjelah Johnson as the infamous Bon Qui Qui. (Sacurrity!!) But the actress and comedian has come a long way since working on the sketch comedy series. She has since released a memoir called Who Do You Think I Am?, and she currently has five comedy specials, including Say I Won't, Not Fancy and Technically Not Stalking. Additionally, she has a podcast with her husband, Manwell Reyes, called Manjela.\n\nIt's worth noting that Johnson avoids using profanity in her routines, so if you're looking for a clean special that'll have the whole family laughing, Angela is definitely the way to go.\n\n11. Dulcé Sloan\n\nBest known for: The Daily Show, @midnight with Chris Hardwick\n\nAll we can say is, thank goodness for Dulcé Sloan's friends. Had it not been for their encouragement, we probably would've never heard her hilarious commentary as a correspondent on The Daily Show.\n\nAfter starting her career in stand-up in 2009, Sloan won the 12th annual StandUp NBC comedy comedy showcase before making her late-night comedy debut on Conan in February 2016. She has since appeared in The Steve Harvey Show, Lights Out with David Spade and RuPaul's Drag Race. Sloan also voiced the character of Honeybee in Fox's The Great North.\n\n12. Katherine Ryan\n\nBest known for: 8 Out of 10 Cats, A League of Their Own, The Duchess\n\nThe Canadian native's sharp and edgy routines are a stark contrast to her wholesome, innocent image, making her comedy all the more memorable. Katherine Ryan kicked off her comedy and acting career in 2008, when she won the Funny Women Award. Shortly after, she appeared in a number of U.K. shows like Campus and Episodes.\n\nRyan gained popularity on Netflix when she released her stand-up specials In Trouble and The Glitter Room.

Margaret Cho\n\nBest known for: Fire Island, 30 Rock, UnCabaret\n\nMargaret Cho's stint on All-American Girl during the '90s helped her launch a massively successful career as an actress and stand-up comic. Among her acting credits are 30 Rock, which earned her an Emmy nom, Face/Off, It's My Party and Fire Island. But what really put her on the map was her bold and unapologetic criticisms of society and the political world in her stand-up routines.\n\nPer IMDb, Cho has released at least six stand-up specials, including UnCabaret, Margaret Cho: PsyCHO and Margaret Cho: Assassin.\n\n15. Kate McKinnon\n\nBest known for: Barbie, Bombshell, Saturday Night Live\n\nShe's widely known for her spot-on celebrity impressions on Saturday Night Live, and more recently, she shined as Weird Barbie in Greta Gerwig's live-action fantasy film, Barbie.
