People staying on their feet.\n\nWhatâs a ridiculous situation youâve been in that you got a joke out of? My carrier pigeon learnt to write and started tampering with my messages.\n\nDon't miss a beat with our FREE daily newsletter\n\nDo you have a pre-show ritual? I always try to find the venue where the showâs on."
