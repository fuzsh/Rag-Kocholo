        "text": "From Lenny Bruce to Dustin Diamond, we look back to the comedians and comic actors who passed away too soon.\n\nLenny Bruce, the outrageous king of the counterculture comics in the 1950s and ’60s, died at age 40 in 1966 of “acute morphine poisoning caused by an overdose.”\n\nJohn Belushi, well known for his toga-loving frat boy performance in “Animal House,” died at 33 of a drug overdose in 1982.\n\nGilda Radner, beloved for her tenure on “SNL” especially for her hilariously geeky character, Roseanne Roseannadanna, died at 42 in 1989 of ovarian cancer.\n\nAndy Kaufman, the eccentric performance artist who gained a following as Latka in “Taxi,” died in 1984 at age 35.\n\nSam Kinison was a rock star of a comic with a trademark shout. After years of battling substance abuse, he was sober and a newlywed of less than a week when he was struck and killed by a teenager driving drunk in 1992. He was 38.\n\nJohn Candy, the lovable comedic actor renowned for his performances in “Uncle Buck,” “Home Alone,” “Planes, Trains and Automobiles” and “Cool Runnings” died at age 43 of a heart attack in 1994.\n\nBill Hicks, one of the most influential stand-up comics, died in 1994 of pancreatic cancer. He was 32.\n\nChris Farley, an SNL star, notorious for his over-the-top performances, especially his motivational speaker character Matt Foley, died in 1997 of a drug overdose. He was 33.\n\nPhil Hartman, star of “SNL,” “NewsRadio” and “The Simpsons” died at age 49 in 1998 of an apparent murder-suicide by his wife.\n\nAcademy Award-nominated comedienne, Madeline Kahn, one of the most influential women in comedy to grace the silver screen, died in 1999 of ovarian cancer. She was 57.\n\nThe prolific comedic actor, John Ritter, best known for his role of Jack Tripper on “Three’s Company” and the patriarchal figure in “8 Rules for Dating My Daughter,” died of a heart attack in 2003. He was 54.\n\nMitch Hedberg, who gained a following of loyal fans for his unconventional stand-up comedy style, died in 2005 at age 37 of a drug overdose.\n\nBernie Mac, the stand up comic legend and star of “Ocean’s Eleven” died at age 50 in 2008 of complications from pneumonia.\n\nGreg Giraldo, the roast comic made famous by Comedy Central died in 2010 at age 44 of a prescription overdose.\n\nPatrice O’Neal, who gave a memorable roast of Charlie Sheen and starred in many Comedy Central specials, died following a stroke in 2011. He was 41.\n\nJay Leggett, who was known to many for his comedic stylings on “In Living Color” died of a heart attack in 2013. He was 50.\n\nJohn Pinette was found dead in a Pittsburgh hotel room in 2014. It is believed the actor, recognizable for getting mugged in the “Seinfeld” series finale, suffered from a pulmonary embolism. He was 50.\n\nRobin Williams, the prolific comic turned Oscar-winning actor, died by suicide in 2014 at age 63. A gifted standup known for his improv skills, high energy and voices, he was one of the leading comedians and actors of his day.\n\nGarry Shandling, the charmingly subversive comedian who upended television traditions with “It’s Garry Shandling‘s Show” and “The Larry Sanders Show,” died of a heart attack in 2016 at age 66.\n\nRalphie May, stand-up comedian and “Last Comic Standing” alum, died of cardiac arrest after a battle with pneumonia in 2017 at the age of 45."
