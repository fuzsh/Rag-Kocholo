        "text": "Bobby (Bob) Franklin Gordon went home to be with his Lord and Savior Jesus Christ on April 6, 2024 with his family surrounding him and his favorite gospel music playing.\n\nBob is survived by his wife, Betsy Huffines Gordon; son, Jeffrey Dean Gordon (Wendy); son, Michael Johnson Gordon (Janice); grandchildren, Cory Gordon, Lance Gordon, Krista Gordon and Tanner Gordon; brother-in-law, Maynard Huffines; and sisters-in-law, Pat Huffines, Raynelle Huffines Coe, and Shirley Huffines.\n\nHe was preceded in death by his father, E.F. (Doc) Gordon; and mother, Ruby Roach Gordon, with whom he was privileged to be born and raised on a small tobacco farm in Brown Summit, NC, sister, Anne Gordon Crews and brother-in-law Calvin Crews; father-in-law, Fayette Huffines; mother-in-law, Josie Huffines; and step mother-in-law, Beulah Brooks Huffines, with whom he enjoyed a very special relationship; and brothers-in-law, Don Huffines and Ron Coe.\n\nBob graduated from Monticello High School in 1958 then graduated from Western Carolina University in 1963 with a business degree. After college he served his country in the National Guard from 1963-1969. Bob married the love of his life, Betsy, with whom he shared 60 years of marriage. He retired in 1999 from State Farm Insurance Co after thirty-three years of service as claims superintendent.\n\nOne of Bob’s most favorite activities in life was spending time with his family. Whether it was a week at North Myrtle Beach, special trips with Betsy, or rabbit hunting with his sons when they were young. Whenever his family was all together (especially at Christmas) he always made the same statement before he prayed for the meal. “’This makes my day (Christmas).”\n\nOther activities Bob enjoyed were gardening and sharing his produce with family, friends and neighbors. One of his life’s joys was watching his children and grandchildren participate in all of their sports and activities, whether it be football, baseball, soccer, dance or singing in the church children’s choir. Bob spent many years serving Jesus by serving others within his church and community. Some of these were Sunday school teacher, welcome committee, chairman of deacons, personnel committee and helping build ramps for veterans and community members with Nehemiah’s Few.\n\nBob was a wonderful husband, father, grandfather and friend. The thought of Bob, PawPaw as he was known by his 4 grandchildren, sitting in his reclining chair, with his headphones on, listening to his favorite gospel music will be a memory we will cherish. He will be greatly missed by all who knew and loved him.\n\nA funeral service will be held at 1pm Friday, April 12, 2024 at Hayworth-Miller Kernersville Chapel with Dr. Rob Decker officiating. Burial will follow at Lakeview Memorial Park. The family will receive friends one hour prior to the service at the funeral home\n\nMemorial donations may be made to Trellis Supportive Care, 101 Hospice Ln. Winston-Salem, NC 27103"
