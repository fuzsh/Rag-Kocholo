        "text": "Presented by Ipswich Civic Centre\n\nNEW VENUE: Fire Station 101 (101 Limestone Street, Ipswich)\n\nMC comedian Anthony Lamond, brings comedy to Ipswich in the monthly Stitch in the ‘swich series.\n\nIn April we welcome Bob Franklin, Jo Gowda and local comedian Neil Mahoney.\n\nBob Franklin is an award-winning comedian, writer, director, author and actor. On Australian television, Franklin was both writer and performer on Jimeoin (1994), Shaun Micallef’s World around Him (1996), Small Tales & True (1998), Eric (1997), The Mick Molloy Show (1999) and Introducing Gary Petty (2000), in which he played the title role and received an Australian Writers’ Guild award nomination. Franklin made several appearances on Thank God You’re Here and Talking ‘bout Your Generation; and has featured in sitcoms such as The Librarians (2007-10), Upper Middle Bogan (2013), Worst Year of My Life Again (2014) and Please Like Me (2013) and Jack Irish (2018 ABC TV). Franklin has appeared in several Australian films, including The Craic (1999), You Can’t Stop The Murders (2003), Bad Eggs (2003), The Extra (2005), Macbeth (2006), BoyTown (2006) The Last Confession of Alexander Pearce (2008), Three Blind Mice (2008) and Beneath Hill 60 (2010).\n\nJo Gowda is an Indian born Australian stand up comic. RAW comedy finalist in 2019 and 2020, Jo will disarm you with her quick wit and cheeky sense of humour. She describes herself as Australia’s second best import (after cricket of course). Jo uses her humour to break barriers, shatter stereotypes and incite thought. You’ll find her humour relatable, amusing and sprinkled with dry wit."
