        "text": "Everyone who has seen him in action knows Bob Franklin is a tough act to follow.\n\nWhen the comedian was in Launceston last year as part of the Melbourne International Comedy Roadshow, he said one upcoming event in particular caught his eye.\n\n“The zombie walk was happening the week after the performance, which would have been interesting,” he said.\n\n“It’s a shame it wasn’t on at the same time, so we could have had some of them come to the show afterwards.”\n\nFranklin is following a similar schedule this year, heading to the Melbourne International Comedy Festival after his Fresh Comedy performance on March 23.\n\nHe was initially scheduled to perform at last month’s Festivale alongside friend Tony Martin, but was forced to withdrawal due to illness.\n\nThe London-born funnyman said his upcoming trip to the apple isle was just what the doctor ordered.\n\n“I had a good look around Launceston the last time I was there, and I quite like Tasmania as a whole,” he said.\n\n“I’d consider living there if I could work out the logistics.”\n\nFranklin is no stranger to uprooting his life, having made the move to Australia from Wales in 1989 when he was in his early 20s.\n\nSince then, he has established himself as an award-winning comedian, writer, director, author and actor."
