        "text": "Biography\n\nTOPICS: MC, COMEDY\n\nBorn to kind but daft parents just outside of London, Franklin was transported at the age of six to Wales after his father stole a paper clip from the civil service. It was here, in the least prestigious of all educational establishments, a Welsh comprehensive school, that Franklin developed a taste for writing and performing and an appreciation of the grotesque and absurd. These qualities first manifested themselves when Franklin wrote and performed in a school pantomime, a production for which he was threatened with expulsion.\n\nHe came to Australia in 1989, enjoying the country so much that he decided to murder a drifter and steal his identity. Fortunately, a major production company stepped in to sponsor Franklin, who now cheerfully admits to feeling a little embarrassed by the whole murder plan.\n\nReturning to his initial inspiration, Franklin recently became a member of the Horror Writers Association and has had two short horror stories published. His dream of combining sketch comedy and urban fantasy has so far met with staunch resistance from TV networks. His morning satire – Up And At ‘Em Australia was nominated for the Stella Award in the Melbourne International Comedy Festival in 1999. The following year he co created and starred in the Australian Writers Guild Award winning – Introducing Gary Petty.\n\nBob continues to do stand up in Australia, the UK and the USA, writing and performing for stage.\n\nBased in VIC – travels everywhere"
