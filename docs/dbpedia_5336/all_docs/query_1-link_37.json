        "text": "\"I used the volunteer placement we did as a blueprint,\" he says. His depictions of wanky travel types though, he says are \"amalgams of various people\", but they're spot on; anyone who's spent time in hostels will recognise the well-travelled good-looking guy with the guitar.\n\nLike his and Roz's experience, the program in the book is a bit \"Mickey Mouse\".\n\n\"The particular placement we did, we found out later was a notorious one for people quitting. Roz and I were the only people that actually finished the two weeks,\" Franklin says.\n\n\"Because of that it did feel a bit pointless; you didn't feel like it was doing any good for anyone. It was still an incredible experience, although I don't know how rewarding it was for the students. But ... it brings money into the country because you pay to do it – so it's doubtless of some benefit. You don't know where exactly that money is going, you just hope that some of it's getting to the people it's meant to.\"\n\nWithout revealing much more than a vague gist of Moving Tigers' plot, Jean finds herself spiralling into a bizarre and terrifying psychosis; most of what happens throughout is driven by her internal monologue. While Franklin hasn't experienced psychosis directly, he has \"had bad trips.\"\n\n\"So I know what a descent into hell is like,\" he laughs. \"I had a 22-hour trip once! It was brilliant at first. For a few hours it was absolutely incredible. And then – then it turned…\"\n\nGood material though?\n\n\"Oh, brilliant,\" he agrees. \"Even in the depths of despair part of your mind's going 'you'll get something out of this'.\"\n\nEnglish-born Franklin was already a stand-up comic (and a builder's labourer) when he moved permanently to Melbourne in 1989, and became widely known for his work as a writer and performer with fellow comedian Jimeoin. Since then he's written for and acted in numerous TV dramas (everything from Stingers to Mr and Mrs Murder), comedies (Shaun Micallef's World Around Him, The Librarians) and feature films, including The Craic and Beneath Hill 60, as well as stand-up shows at the Melbourne Comedy Festival.\n\nBut his writing and his stand-up is often underpinned by a dark streak. He has, he says, long been a \"horror nerd.\"\n\n\"Although I think of Moving Tigers more as a dark little travel story… I'm keen to impress upon people that I don't think it's a grim read,\" he says. \"But I do love my horror.\"\n\nHis love affair with the genre began with the work of legendary American horror writer HP Lovecraft.\n\n\"When I was a kid I found a Lovecraft anthology in a drawer in the bedside in my parents' room – I don't know what I doing looking in there! – and I got into horror from there.\"\n\nHis other favourite authors include British writer Ramsey Campbell, English ghost story writer MR James and the short stories of Stephen King.\n\nHorror is a genre that best lends itself to the short story format, says Franklin, whose first published work, Under Stones (published in 2010) was a collection of short \"tales of unease\". That book won the horror writing Australian Shadows Award and was shortlisted for Best Collection and Best Horror Short Story for Take the Free Tour in the Aurealis Awards.\n\nHis directorial debut, a short film he wrote and directed for Trop Fest, Corrections, was also a horror (it opened the Sydney International Horror Film Festival in 2009) as is Hammer Or Claw, another short he made for this year's Trop Fest. While it might at first seem incongruous, Franklin reckons the mechanics of writing horror and comedy aren't all that different.\n\nCorrections from Head Space Entertainment on Vimeo.\n\n\"I think they're actually very close – if you think of a sketch, and you think of the short horror story, they both basically deal with a situation where the world stops making sense. You can play that for laughs or you can play it for discomfort,\" he says. \"I think that's why things like (British comedy series) The League Of Gentleman and Black Mirror work so well.\"\n\nBoth programs, subversive and uncomfortable in their humour, are favourites – and precisely the kind of thing Franklin would like to be making here.\n\n\"I've tried for 10 years to make something like that but … I don't know. People tell you there's no market (here) for those things. But we're constantly being told there's no market for things but clearly it's people who haven't got the bottle to find out whether there's a market,\" he says.\n\n\"I think there's a lot of resistance on the part of the industry to making things that are uncomfortable. I guess because it's risky … it's very frustrating.\"\n\nParticularly when many of these programs are popular among illegal downloaders. The rapidly changing entertainment landscape though – TV on demand, web series – might open things up to more diverse content?\n\n\"When cable came along, people said 'this'll open things up!', then things like ABC 2 started and you think 'now there's a chance to make more interesting stuff' – and then it closes down again!\"\n\nIt's a depressing state of affairs, he says.\n\n\"There's this obsession with making things comfortable for people – it's not about provoking people any more, about putting something in front of them that'll make them think, it's about – they make it as easy as possible for people, You've gotta think about what situation you're creating.\"\n\nFranklin's work is consistently described as \"under-rated\" (although the Herald Sun has been known to describe it as \"particularly dreadful\") and while that's flattering, it \"doesn't really help\". At least with his live comedy, he can control the situation.\n\n\"I write the show and put it in front of people. Once you get into TV and film you get hundreds of people in between in the middle of that process, that's what stops it happening.\"\n\nLately Franklin has veered towards directing – he's currently been directing a new comedy series with local comic Sam Petersen and is keen to take on more. (He's not averse to the odd day job, either, working as a soccer coach at the Archie Thompson School of Soccer, and taking on the odd labouring gig now and then).\n\n\"I absolutely love directing, and it's one of those things you can do without having to keep up your bleedin' profile, all that side of things, \" he says.\n\n\"It's not like going in and doing a couple of lines in something and hanging around all day, trying to find things to do on set that you can't really commit to because it's a different frame of mind. With directing you spend whole days planning it, and you go in and it feels like you're doing a proper day's work and you come home feeling tired and satisfied – it's very appealing on that basis.\"\n\nAnd while it won't make him rich – \"Ha!\" – Franklin says he'll keep up the writing. As well as a feature film, he's got another anthology of his dark tales ready to go.\n\n\"It's an absolutely ridiculous thing to do, really.\"\n\nBob Franklin's debut novel Moving Tigers is out now, published by through Affirm Press, $19.99."
