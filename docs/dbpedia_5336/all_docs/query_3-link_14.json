My apologies if you misinterpreted that. (In my original post I gave the eye roll to them ... that was the hence part. Looking back, it didn't read that way and looked directed at you which was never my intention. I am sorry about that.)\n\nI am just dumbfounded they couldn't give out his name when it was easily accessible before. RCCL absolutely deserves my eye roll. üòâ\n\n*edited for clarification"
