        "text": "NEW VENUE – FIRE STATION 101\n\nMC comedian Anthony Lamond, brings comedy to Ipswich in the monthly Stitch in the ‘swich series.\n\nIn April we welcome Bob Franklin, Jo Gowda and local comedian Neil Mahoney.\n\nBob Franklin is an award-winning comedian, writer, director, author and actor. On Australian television, Franklin was both writer and performer on Jimeoin (1994), Shaun Micallef’s World around Him (1996), Small Tales & True (1998), Eric (1997), The Mick Molloy Show (1999) and Introducing Gary Petty (2000), in which he played the title role and received an Australian Writers’ Guild award nomination.\n\nJo Gowda is an Indian born Australian stand up comic. RAW comedy finalist in 2019 and 2020, Jo will disarm you with her quick wit and cheeky sense of humour. Jo uses her humour to break barriers, shatter stereotypes and incite thought. You’ll find her humour relatable, amusing and sprinkled with dry wit.\n\nNeil Mahoney decided to change careers in his 50’s, and so embarked on a law degree. He is almost all the way through, and due to graduate soon, and still has no idea what he wants to do! He figured a lot of lawyers become comedians after a stressful few years of legal work, but he decided to cut the work stress part of that journey and try comedy anyway. What could go wrong?\n\nFriday 22nd April 2022 at 20:00 – 22:00\n\nSource: Discover Ipswich"
