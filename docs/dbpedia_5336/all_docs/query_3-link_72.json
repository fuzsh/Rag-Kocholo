        "text": "Topline\n\nComedian Katt Williams is dominating social media this week after he called out a long list of other comedians and entertainers—like Steve Harvey, Cedric the Entertainer, Kevin Hart and P. Diddy—for personal grievances and other criticisms in a nearly three-hour long appearance on Shannon Sharpe’s “Club Shay Shay” podcast.\n\nKey Facts\n\nChief Critics\n\nSeveral of Williams’ targets have responded, including Cedric the Entertainer, who wrote in an Instagram comment: “Revisionist History, regardless of whatever Katts opinion My career can’t be reduced to One Joke Katt Williams claims as his.” He criticized Williams for calling him out publicly: “All that tough talk! Is corny af I’m grown ass man. And none of that sh*t gonna go like you think. You do you and I got this over here.” Hart responded in a post on X, calling Williams’ comments “honestly sad” and attaching a trailer to his upcoming movie “Lift.” Smiley said on his radio show Thursday he had “no reason to lie about” the casting for “Friday After Next,” stating “there was no way in the hell I could have executed that role like that and I’m glad that they made that decision.” Smiley said it “makes me sad the way [Williams’ comments] made my kids feel,” but wished Williams “nothing but the best.”\n\nContra\n\nWilliams struck a more sympathetic tone toward several celebrities, including Taraji P. Henson, who went viral in December for an emotional interview on being underpaid in Hollywood. He called Henson’s interview the “saddest thing ever,” stating: “Imagine being one of the very top of your lane to the point where, if they don’t take you for the role, there’s not three Black actresses that they can say are bigger than you.” He also criticized the public for making a spectacle of Kanye West, stating: “I suspect that we’re pretty awful people if we say that somebody got a mental illness and then we watch what they do.”\n\nBig Number\n\n7.8 million. That’s how many views Williams’ appearance on “Club Shay Shay” has as of Thursday afternoon, just one day after being uploaded. The video has more than 50,000 comments.\n\nFurther Reading\n\nKatt Williams Slams Cedric the Entertainer for Allegedly Stealing One of His Jokes (The Hollywood Reporter)\n\nKatt Williams Scorches the Earth and Every Comedian on It (Vulture)"
