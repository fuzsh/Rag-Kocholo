        "text": "Meet Bob Franklin – a dedicated individual with an illustrious career spanning over 50 years in the Arkansas Fire Service. Married to the former Bunny Bokony, Bob is a proud father of three children: Mandy, Jessica, and Michael. His journey in firefighting began in 1970 as a volunteer, marking the inception of a remarkable career path. Bob served the Little Rock Fire Department for 28 years, ascending to the rank of Captain before his retirement. Alongside his wife, Bob played a pivotal role in establishing the Northeast Saline County Fire District in 1984, where he served as Fire Chief for an impressive 23 years until his retirement in 2007.\n\nNotably, Bob’s dedication and expertise earned him recognition as the youngest firefighter to achieve Certified Fire Instructor status. He further distinguished himself by becoming the first fire instructor from the State of Arkansas to teach at the esteemed Fire Department Instructor Conference in Indianapolis, Indiana. For eight consecutive years, Bob imparted his knowledge through his renowned “Let’s Talk Pumps” class, educating hundreds of firefighters from across the globe.\n\nBeyond his service in firefighting, Bob’s entrepreneurial spirit led him to establish the oldest fire pump repair company in the state, alongside a reputable fire apparatus repair business. He provided service for Waters and American Fire pumps, leaving an indelible mark on the industry. As an avid historian of the fire service, Bob boasts a remarkable collection of fire memorabilia dating back to the early 1800s, complemented by his extensive collection of fire apparatus. Bob Franklin’s legacy is not only one of service and dedication but also of passion for preserving the rich history of the fire service."
