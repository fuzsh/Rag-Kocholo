        "text": "“i JuST dON’T tHInk fEmale comEdiANs aRE fUnny.”\n\nWell, I’m just a girl, standing in front of the people spewing that nonsense, asking them to shut the *actual* eff up. Honestly, thinking women aren't funny is such a tired (not to mention BORING) opinion. It also simply doesn't hold up! Some of the best comedians working today just happen to be women. Even outside of the comedy world, whether it's giving funny gifts or trolling on social media, women have always been—and will continue to be—funny. So to celebrate all of our collective humor, we've put together a list of the best female comedians working right now.\n\nOne of the coolest things about comedy today, IMO, is how it’s expanding to include new forms. I love seeing standup comedians (sometimes in person, but mostly by watching their Netflix specials on the couch while wearing sweats and drinking wine), but I also love discovering new funny women who are changing the comedy landscape by starting their own comedy podcasts or bringing their lol-worthy acts to TikTok and Instagram. The female comedians on this list all had different career paths, but they share one crucial thing in common: they are hilarious, and you will be laughing by the end of this list. You're welcome.\n\nJacqueline Novak\n\nComedy’s current It Girl, Jacqueline Novak recently released her one-woman show on Netflix, titled Get On Your Knees. Her show was hailed by the The New York Times and won a Drama Desk Award before being made into a special, which was directed by Natasha Lyonne. If you want more Jacqueline, she’s written a memoir titled How to Weep in Public: Feeble Offerings on Depression from One Who Knows and hosts a podcast with Kate Berlant called Poog.\n\nKate Berlant\n\nSpeaking of Kate Berlant, she’s next up on our list. The comedian is best known for her improv skills, but you may also recognize her from various drama films including Once Upon a Time in Hollywood and Don’t Worry Darling. In 2022, she released a sketch comedy special with comedian John Early called Would It Kill You to Laugh?, and her Hulu comedy special, Cinnamon in the Wind, is absolutely hilarious. Berlant’s current one-woman show, Kate, is running internationally after a lengthy run in New York City. Plus, the show is directed by Bo Burnham.\n\nKatherine Ryan\n\nThis UK-based funny lady has built a stellar reputation in the comedy space, and even won the Funny Women award back in 2008. She’s a regular at Edinburgh Fringe, has multiple stand-up specials on Netflix, and created her own Netflix comedy, The Duchess.\n\nChristina P.\n\nThe TikToker's know Christina P. The comedian regularly goes viral for hilarious bits from the podcast she hosts with her husband, fellow comedian Tom Segura. Their pod, Your Mom’s House, sparked an entire podcast studio which produces other popular shows including 2 Bears, 1 Cave, Dr. Drew After Dark, Where My Moms At?, First Date with Lauren Compton, and more.\n\nMs. Pat\n\nMs. Pat has been taking the stage longer than some of our readers have been alive, beginning her career in Atlanta in 2002. These days, she's a regular on the comedy podcast circuit, making appearances on the pods of such comedians as Marc Maron, Bobby Lee, Kevin Hart, and Joe Rogan. She also hosts her own podcast, The Patdown with Ms. Pat.\n\nEsther Povitsky\n\nYou may know Esther Povitsky from her role in Dollface, her upcoming series Drugstore June, her hit podcast Trash Tuesday, or her latest stand-up special—which is available to watch in full on YouTube. The hilarious comedienne is also a regular on TikTok, where she decodes the random obsessions of the LA hot girls, including overpriced grocery stores and new off the wall skincare routines.\n\nWanda Sykes\n\nWanda Sykes has been a full-time comedian since the ‘90s, and in her decades in the business, she’s done a lot. She’s appeared on Def Comedy Jam, wrote for The Chris Rock Show, toured with her standup, headlined comedy specials, and hosted a late-night talk show and the Academy Awards. And through it all, she’s also been an advocate for LGBTQ+ rights. She most recently dropped a brand new special, Wanda Sykes: I'm an Entertainer.\n\nMichelle Wolf\n\nMichelle Wolf made headlines for weeks following her headlining set at the 2018 White House Correspondents’ Dinner. The standup comic, who briefly headlined her own talk show on Netflix, The Break with Michelle Wolf, pulled no punches at the event, taking aim at Donald Trump, CNN, and, most controversially, Sarah Huckabee Sanders. Debates of feminism, comedy, and the role of the White House Correspondents’ Dinner followed, but Wolf never backed down from her set, and she continues to include harsh but fair political criticism in her work.\n\nMargaret Cho\n\nMargaret Cho is known for her unapologetic, raunchy standup, but she’s more than just shock value. In the ‘90s, her show All-American Girl became the first Asian American sitcom — another one wouldn’t come along for decades. She’s one of the most prominent Asian American standups, frequently incorporates her Korean heritage into her routines, and is a longtime LBGTQ+ rights advocate, as seen in her 2015 special, .\n\nZiwe\n\nZiwe launched her career on YouTube as a performer and writer. She’s co-hosted podcasts and conducted viral Instagram interviews that led directly to her variety show, , where she got to show off her confrontational yet hilarious interview skills.\n\nAmber Ruffin\n\nAmber Ruffin currently hosts her own talk show, on Peacock, where she makes current events and complex subjects, like critical race theory, funny. She’s also a regular presence on Late Night with Seth Meyers, where she’s a writer, and has been featured in comedy shows like Key and Peele and Big Mouth. She’s also just genuinely delightful.\n\nSamantha Bee\n\nSamantha Bee started her comedy career in Canada, where she performed sketch comedy with her troupe, the Atomic Fireballs. She eventually became a household name when she became a fixture of The Daily Show, which she appeared on from 2003-2014 as a correspondent. As the show gained popularity, so did Bee. She eventually launched her own show, Full Frontal with Samantha Bee, which aired from 2015-2022, and currently hosts a podcast, .\n\nPatti Harrison\n\nYou might know Patti Harrison from her appearances on Ziwe, or I Think You Should Leave with Tim Robinson, or maybe from her standup, or the time she got banned from Twitter for changing her verified Twitter profile to make it look like she was the official Nilla Wafers account. Regardless of where you first saw the comedian, you probably agree that to know her is to love her.\n\nKristen Wiig\n\nAs a cast member of Saturday Night Live, Kristen Wiig made a name for herself by creating wacky characters—Gilly, the Target Lady, Sue the Surprise Lady—and her willingness to be as silly as it takes to get a crowd to laugh. Off of SNL, she co-wrote and starred in Bridesmaids, the movie that accidentally kicked off the entire “are women funny” discourse of the 2010s.\n\nMichelle Buteau\n\nIf you don’t know her standup, you might think Michelle Buteau is Netflix’s best hidden secret weapon. She pops up frequently in Netflix original movies — Someone Great, Always Be My Maybe, Work It — stealing the show with her comedic timing. She’s currently starring in the streamer’s Survival of the Thickest, a show she also created.\n\nTig Notaro\n\nKnown for her deadpan delivery, Tig Notaro has taken her comedy everywhere, from standup to podcasts, books to television shows and movies. Through it all, she hasn't shied away from including her private life in her work, speaking openly about everything from her fight with breast cancer and her daily life with her wife and their kids. You can see her raw, funny honesty in her 2018 Netflix special, Tig Notaro: Happy to be Here.\n\nNicole Byer\n\nThose of us who watched a lot of MTV after school got to know Nicole Byer through Girl Code, where she dispensed hilarious but true bits of wisdom like “playing the field is when you have your hand on multiple cookies in the jar.” These days, you can find her trying to get to the bottom of her love life on her podcast, Why Won’t You Date Me? where she interviews comedians, friends, and former flings about their romantic lives while trying to make sense of her own. If you just can’t get enough Nicole (we don’t blame you one bit), you can also find her cracking jokes as the host of Netflix’s Nailed It!, a reality baking show.\n\nAubrey Plaza\n\nWhether you fell in love with her as April Ludgate on Parks and Rec or as Riley in Happiest Season, it’s hard to resist Aubrey Plaza’s deadpan wit. It was on full display at the Film Independent Spirit Awards last year, where she absolutely skewered like, half of Hollywood—and they freaking loved it, of course. Whether she’s pranking her costars or pretending (?) to get in fights on the red carpet, we can’t wait to see what she does next.\n\nTaylor Tomlinson\n\nIf you haven’t watched Taylor Tomlinson’s special Quarter-Life Crisis on Netflix, what are you even doing? It’s like watching your funniest friend talk about what being in your 20s is really like, from the regrettable dating choices to trying to navigate your relationship with your parents as a grown-up. Obviously, it’s hilarious. Although she’s only 27, she’s been on the comedy scene since she was a teenager and has the comedy resume to prove it. She has appeared on the late-night circuit, was a finalist a few years ago on Last Comic Standing, and also killed it in the standup series The Comedy Lineup.\n\nWhitney Cummings\n\nTBH, I don’t know when Whitney Cummings finds the time to sleep. She has four comedy specials (you can stream them on Netflix, , Comedy Central, and ), released , where she interviews celebrities, comics, and experts, oh, AND she tours. Wherever you find her performing, she’s known for totally pushing the limit—not to spoil anything, but her latest special on Netflix features a sex robot that looks exactly like her.\n\nSarah Cooper\n\nIf you spent any time on the internet in 2020, you definitely know Sarah Cooper. She went viral for her lip-syncing of weird, unbelievable things that Donald Trump said in interviews and speeches. Variety named her one of the \"10 Comics to Watch in 2020,\" and she appeared on tons of late-night shows. Don't miss her comedy special Everything's Fine on Netflix, and keep an eye out for celebrity cameos from people like Megan Thee Stallion and Maya Rudolph.\n\nBrittany Broski\n\nKombucha Girl!!! After the video of her trying Kombucha for the first time became meme-worthy content, Brittany Broski became one of TikTok’s biggest comedy stars. Since then, she’s racked up 6.3 million followers and recently started hosting the For You podcast, where she discusses all things TikTok and interviews its buzziest content creators.\n\nAmy Schumer\n\nThe Queen of Raunch reigns. Amy Schumer has seriously taketh over. Her Comedy Central show Inside Amy Schumer gave us some of the funniest music videos ever, from Milk Milk Lemonade to Girl, You Don’t Need Makeup. On top of a slew of comedy specials, she hit the big screen with laugh-out-loud comedies, like Train Wreck and I Feel Pretty. Recently, Amy debuted a self-shot comedy cooking show, Amy Schumer Learns to Cook, in which her chef husband (read: the dream) Chris Fischer tries to teach Amz how to cook.\n\nAli Wong\n\nYou may have gotten your first taste of Ali Wong courtesy of fellow female comedians Chelsea Handler and Amy Schumer. But she *really* made her mark with Baby Cobra, her first Netflix standup special on stuff like sex, hoarding, and feminism, which she performed while seven months preggo (!). Oh, and she did it again with her second bébé during her Hard Knock Wife special. She rounded out a trilogy of specials with Don Wong in 2022.\n\nKate McKinnon\n\n*looks around* Fine, I’ll say it. If you ask me, Kate McKinnon may have been the funniest person on Saturday Night Live. Fun fact: She was not only the longest-serving female cast member, Kate was also the first openly lesbian cast member. But let’s get right to her best shit: her impressions. From Elizabeth Warren, to Hillary Clinton, Justin Bieber, Ellen, and Jeff Sessions, she does it all.\n\nLeslie Jones\n\nSPEAKING of kick-ass SNL comedians…Leslie Jones was nothing short of hilarious during her time at Studio 8H. Her Weekend Update guest spots were *iconic*. Since she closed her chapter on Saturday Night Live, she’s released Leslie Jones: Time Machine, her “joyfully raw and outrageous” Netflix standup special.\n\nMindy Kaling\n\nMindy Kaling first wracked up our laughs in the writers’ room and on-camera as The Office’s high-maintenance drama queen, Kelly Kapoor. And that was just the tip of her comedy empire. This comedian has made Hollywood hers, from writing and starring in The Mindy Project and the feature film Late Night to creating and writing Netflix’s teen rom-com series Never Have I Ever. In short: lucky for us, this funny lady continues to crush it. FYI: She’s set to co-write Legally Blonde 3. What, like it’s hard?\n\nHeather McMahan\n\nThis self-described “high-functioning hot mess” is no doubt, all of your friends’ fave funny Instagram follow. Comedian Heather McMahan is known for delivering hysterical gripings about life’s regular annoyances while also playing original comedic characters and nailing the best Ina Garten impression you’ve ever seen. Girl has a critically acclaimed comedy tour, hosts a weekly comedy podcast, Absolutely Not!, and posts IG stories that’ll make you howl on the daily, proving that she is, for real, doing the absolute most.\n\nRebel Wilson\n\n“At first, I did not know it was your diary, I thought it was a very sad handwritten book.” Rebel Wilson was THE breakout star in Bridesmaids. Since then, one of our faves from down unda’ has flexed her comedic chops in Pitch Perfect, How to Be Single, Isn’t It Romantic, Cats, and so much more. And on top of everything else, she’s the brightest spot of any awards show she’s at.\n\nSarah Silverman\n\nWhile she made her mark in comedy more than 10 years ago thanks to stand up, The Sarah Silverman Program, and late-night comedy bits, Sarah’s focus now skews more toward a platform for politics, seen most recently in on Hulu.\n\nAwkwafina\n\nAlright, did NOT realize Awkwafina’s first foray into comedy came via her “vag,” aka her rap music video that has well over 5 mill views. Awkwafina has since taken her comedic chops to big-time movies, including Crazy Rich Asians, Shang-Chi, and The Little Mermaid. She was also the first-ever Asian American to win a Golden Globe in any lead actress film category for her role in com-dram The Farewell. If you *really* want to see her shine, you MUST watch her Comedy Central series Awkwafina Is Nora from Queens. Brace yaself for her hysterical show about a 27-year-old who moves back home and is struggling to “adult.”\n\nMary Beth Barone\n\nYou guys. She’s comedy’s new ~It girl~. Mary Beth Barone delivers sarcastic, self-aware content that hits for us 20something chicks because she is a 20something chick. She’s performed on Comedy Central’s Up Next, hosted Drag His Ass, a live comedy show, and appeared in an episode of Black Mirror.\n\nHannah Gadsby\n\nAussie Hannah Gadsby came onto the ~scene~ after winning a comedian competition in her homeland. But her humor hit the States thanks to Nanette, her Netflix stand-up spesh/ . This, paired with her super-honest commentary on trauma, gender, sexuality, and childhood turmoil, won her hella awards, including an Emmy.\n\nChelsea Peretti\n\nYou may recognize Chelsea Peretti from her role as Gina on Brooklyn Nine-Nine. Her standup special premiered on Netflix in 2014, and since then, she’s also released her concept EP Foam and Flotsam (aka a record of funny songs). Her directorial debut, First Time Female Director, premiered at the 2023 Tribeca Film Festival.\n\nJenny Slate\n\nShe’s seriously *Jean Ralphio singing voice* the BEST. Jenny Slate, who you may remember from her hysterical portrayal of Mona-Lisa Saperstein on Parks and Recreation, has a long list of comedic credits, including stints on the Kroll Show and SNL. She released her first standup special, Stage Fright in 2019, and, in 2023, saw her film, Marcel the Shell with Shoes On, nominated for Best Animated Feature at the Academy Awards.\n\nIliza Shlesinger\n\nSo, comedian Iliza Shlesinger is the youngest (and only female!) winner of Last Comic Standing. YGG! She has—count ’em—SIX standup specials on Netflix, her most recent being Iliza Shlesinger: Hot Forever.\n\nTiffany Haddish"
