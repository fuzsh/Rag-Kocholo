        "text": "Bob Franklin is a highly respected writer, actor and comedian (perhaps most recognisable from The Librarians, Stupid Stupid Men and Thank God You’re Here).\n\nHe recently wrote and directed a short film called Corrections and has several other projects in pipelines. Bob’s work has been described in The Age as ‘genuinely subversive, dank and nasty’ and by the Herald Sun as ‘particularly dreadful’.\n\nThe stories in his debut collection Under Stones are not horror per se; they are much more unsettling than that. They are tales of unease set in familiar surrounds and whispered in your ear by a friendly stranger."
