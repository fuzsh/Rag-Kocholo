        "text": "Genderfluid comic Eddie Izzard has landed on a new name that’s the best of both worlds.\n\nThe actor-comedian revealed the name change during an appearance on \"The Political Party\" podcast. While reflecting on her relationship with pronouns, Izzard told host Matt Forde that she’s altering her name to better encompass her transgender identity.\n\n\"I’m Eddie. There’s another name I’m going to add in as well, which is Suzy, which I wanted to be since I was 10,\" Izzard said. \"I’m going to be Suzy Eddie Izzard.\"\n\nIzzard said she’s keeping her public name as Eddie Izzard and that people are free to choose the name they address her with. \"They can’t go wrong with me,\" she added.\n\n'I just want to be based in girl mode': Comedian Eddie Izzard to use she/her pronouns\n\nTommy Dorfman says being on '13 Reasons Why''delayed' growth as trans woman, reveals engagement\n\nDuring an appearance on Sky Arts’ \"Portrait Artist of the Year\" in December 2020, Izzard announced that she is exclusively using she/her pronouns.\n\n\"I try to do things that I think are interesting. This is the first program I’ve asked if I can be 'she' and 'her' — this is a little transition period,\" Izzard said to one of the contestants on the British painting competition series.\n\n\"(People) just know me from before, but I'm genderfluid. I just want to be based in girl mode from now on,\" she added. \"It feels very positive &mldr; One life, live it well.\"\n\nIzzard has previously come out as genderfluid, telling Joe Rogan in May 2019 that she's \"going to have, like a superhero, boy mode and girl mode.\"\n\n\"It's easier for me to be in girl mode,\" Izzard said at the time. \"I have a confidence now, I carry myself with a certain confidence.\"\n\nIzzard is best known for her stand-up comedy, including 1999's \"Dress to Kill,\" as well as film roles like 2004's \"Ocean's Twelve,\" 2007's \"Ocean's Thirteen\" and 2020’s “The High Note.”\n\nSomeone who is genderfluid doesn't “identify with a single fixed gender, or has a fluid or unfixed gender identity,” according to the Human Rights Campaign. They prefer to simply be seen as a person who will choose to live and look in whatever manner that feels true to themselves.\n\n'Being transgender is not a medical condition':The meaning of trans broken arm syndrome\n\n'Never felt better': Tommy Dorfman reflects on reintroducing herself as a woman to the world\n\nContributing: Sara M Moniuszko, USA TODAY"
