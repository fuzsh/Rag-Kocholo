        "text": "“From night clubs to laundry mats, I’ve performed everywhere.”\n\nJerrold Benford is currently establishing himself as a fixture on the eastern comedy circuit. He was born and raised in Virginia, but began his career in New Jersey, where he quickly made a name for himself.\n\nJerrold has performed in New Jersey and New York’s finest clubs including: Rascals, Broadway Comedy Club, New York Comedy Club, Stand Up NY, Gotham Comedy Club, Stress Factory and the renowned Caroline’s on Broadway. He also features and headlines clubs, colleges, and private functions from the east coast to the west.\n\n“My first actual comedy club headline opportunity came from Catch A Rising Star in Princeton, NJ. They continually bring me back to close the show.”\n\nHis distinctive perspective on dating and marriage topics combines with a high energy, friendly delivery to create wickedly clever content and a wildly funny act. His eye for absurdities in everyday life and his quirky, unique writing style leaves crowds in stitches.\n\nJerrold has been described by audience members as “hilarious” and “funny as hell”, while bookers have labeled Jerrold as a definite “rising star”. Intelligent and silly, Jerrold’s act has become a hit all up and down the east coast, entertaining crowds young and old of different backgrounds and tastes.\n\n“I consider myself a damn fool that loves to make people laugh – in other words I’m Funny For No Damn Reason.”\n\nI’ve been called as well as a damn fool. I’ll tell take it! It’s what us class clowns turned comedians get all our lives. But we’re important. We remind folks to laugh when they wanna cry and turn not-so-great situations into situations you can eventually laugh about.\n\nIt’s not easy making folks laugh. It takes talent – and a whole lotta time. It’s a craft we slowly perfect until it looks natural and the average comedy show patron says, “I could do that.”\n\nThis is my space to not only keep you giggling, but keep you up on all things – ME. So if you love comedy shows, funny skits, hilarious blogs and a store chock full of goodies, this is the spot you wanna be. Sit back, relax and enjoy me being me – Funny For No Damn Reason!\n\nI’ve been called as well as a damn fool. I’ll tell take it! It’s what us class clowns turned comedians get all our lives.
