        "text": "Comedian Carlos Mencia will perform Saturday at Sports USA with Trish Suhr and Jordan Rock\n\nIf you’ve seen any of Carlos Mencia’s comedy specials, you might know that his first name is not really Carlos.\n\nIt’s Ned.\n\nThe name change goes back to Mencia’s early stand-up days at The Comedy Store in Hollywood, and was suggested by the store’s legendary owner, Mitzi Shore.\n\n“She said, ‘You can’t be an angry Mexican named Ned.’ And I said, ‘Well, first of all, I’m not Mexican, I’m from Honduras,” Mencia said. “And she said, ‘‘Everybody’s going to think you’re Mexican, so deal with it.’ “\n\nMencia, 50, has been making light of his heritage for decades, through a series of television specials and his own Comedy Central show, “Mind of Mencia.”\n\nThe comedian will headline a show Saturday at 7:30 p.m. at Sports USA on Fort Bragg. Comics Trish Suhr and Jordan Rock, younger brother of Chris Rock, are also scheduled to appear.\n\nRecently, Mencia answered some questions by phone from his Los Angeles home. Here are excerpts:\n\nWeekender: Where are you talking to me from?\n\nMencia: The gym. I don’t want to look too fat in front of those troops (laughs).\n\nWeekender: Are you currently on tour? How’s it going?\n\nMencia: I don’t know if you call it touring, (but) I try to perform as much as I can. When I can perform, I try to take advantage of it, sometimes it’s a year, sometimes it’s five, sometimes it’s more, because once a project starts, TV, movies, something like that, all that time gets swallowed up and you don’t get to perform.\n\nWeekender: Tell me about the show you'll be bringing here.\n\nMencia: I try to talk about things that are happening in the news or in society. I try to tap into what’s going on, relatable themes and feelings. And so the longer I’m away from it, the harder it is to get back into the flow of things. I’m just always in the pulse.\n\nWeekender: Is it different performing for troops?\n\nMencia: I try not to plan ahead, but I’ve been overseas before, I’ve been to Iraq, Afghanistan. There’s a lot of great stories about performing for the troops overseas that I’m probably going to convey just to connect in that respect.\n\nI remember when I was at a forward operating base in Iraq and I said to the commander there, 'What are the parameters (for the show)?' and he said, 'You can say whatever you want. I really don’t care. We’re at a forwarding operating base, you might be in the middle of a joke and we have to take (you) out of here.’\n\nWeekender: You’ll be with Trish Suhr and Jordan Rock. Have you performed with them before?\n\nMencia: No I haven’t, and I’m looking forward to it.\n\nI love comedy. I’m a fan. And I’m a fan on every level. Unlike most of my friends, I can watch every level of comedian, from those that have done it longer and better than I have to those that haven’t and have a lot to learn, and everything in between. So I’m really looking forward to watching them and seeing what they do and seeing how we can gel together, three different people creating one show.\n\nWeekender: Who influenced you most as a comedian?\n\nMencia: You know what’s funny, I did not know what comedy was until literally months before I stepped on stage. I was an immigrant kid who had parents who controlled the television, and I never got to see late night TV. I didn’t know what stand-up comedy was. My influences, believe it or not, were all the comedians that I kind of grew up watching at the Comedy Store when I was a doorman. They are guys that most people will never know.\n\nWeekender: As a native of Honduras, do you have any thoughts about the current immigration situation?\n\nMencia: There (are) I don’t know how many immigrants in this country, and the majority of them have jobs and that to me is the crux of it.\n\nWe give immigrants jobs, and then we wonder why they’re here. This is the problem. America has an issue in my opinion with myopia. Especially with the internet. If you want to see news on the right, you go to Fox. If you want to see news on the left, you go to MSNBC. It creates the environment where we are unable to see the whole picture.\n\nWeekender: What’s next for you?\n\nMencia: I’m working on a special right now. As a matter of fact, some people from one of the major networks are coming to see me so we can finalize what material we’re going to put on the special.\n\nIt’s been about eight years since I’ve done movies or anything, so it’s about time for me to get back. I’m in a good place right now, and so this new special is a big push toward that.\n\nStaff writer Rodger Mullen can be reached at rmullen@fayobserver.com or 486-3561."
