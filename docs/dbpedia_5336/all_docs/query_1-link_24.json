The design is a deliberate dichotomy that uses a classic retro aesthetic. It harks back to the 'gentlemanly' days of civilized drinking; but also uses text and headlines which poke fun at indulging in its excesses. The text was taken from old tabloid headlines & pull copy and juxtaposes them in a way that makes the resulting visual blend a comedy of dubious ambiguity and puzzling rhetoric.\n\nKeeping in the theme of 1960's iconography, we used 3 retro-inspired mascots (All named 'Hoppy McHopface'– in itself a reference to Australian pop culture) to represent the 3 beers in the range. Each one was designed with a similar feel– smartly dressed, wearing a crown and bowtie, while each one is shown doing something related to the background text.\n\nWe also developed further promotional POS material using variations of the can graphics to extend the reach of the brand.\n\nProject Beer Bros packaging design\n\nThis presentation showcases our design and illustration work for The Beer Bros. limited-edition range of craft beers, 'Dark 'n' Dirty, Antique Willy & Balding Fish'.

Through the use of strategy and research, we developed a brand story that is softly spoken, human and approachable yet dominant, bold and immediately recognizable.\n\nThe logo is built as the visual cornerstone of the company values of compassion, integrity and human-centered. The identity was to flow through to the stationary as well as advertising collateral, signage, and the company website.\n\nAustralian Centre of Trauma and Wellness\n\nWalker Design Co. was hired to design the brand identity and architecture for a newly created psychology practice located in Victoria, Australia specializing in the abatement and recovery of mental trauma.\n\nThe client required a strong brand presence amongst its peers within the industry.

That's why when we were approached by Gristmill to design the key graphic for season 3 of Upper Middle Bogan, we jumped for joy.\n\nThe brief involved designing the visual look including type treatments, colour usage, wordmark design as well as the creation of usage guidelines which allowed pay tv companies to produce their own GUI artwork based on our original design.\n\nAustralian television has gone from strength to strength in recent years.
