Filmed live from The Famous Spiegeltent, join Jimeoin and Bob in this hilarious one hour stage show as they prepare dishes which have seemingly no educational or culinary meritâ¦but are really, really funny. Awards for the show include the EDINBURGH INTERNATIONAL CRITICS AWARD FOR COMEDY, THE SCOTTISH DAILY NEWS EXPRESS NEW NAMES AWARD and the VARIETY CLUB OF AUSTRALIA AWARD. âCompletely, ridiculously funnyâ¦â The Scotsman âA riotous whirlwind of inventive props and ridiculous improvisation with Jimeoin and Bob hamming it up as the Penn and Teller of cuisineâ¦â The Independent, London"
