        "text": "Robert \"Bob\" Franklin\n\nRobert “Bob” Franklin was born on Long Island, N.Y., to Bennett Robert Franklin and Eleanor Lancaster. The family moved to Philadelphia when Bob was four. He attended Martha Washington Elementary School and graduated from Dobbins Vocational High School. He entered the Air Force in 1952, served in the 15th Recon Technical Squadron and trained as a lithograph pressman.\n\nDischarged in 1954, Franklin went to work for the Ralph E. Harris mailing house in Philadelphia as a press operator and remained there for 30 years.\n\nIn 1984, Franklin befriended John Queen, a mural painter, sculptor, and printmaker who introduced him to the Brandywine Workshop. Franklin quickly mastered the medium of original fine-art publishing and spent the next three decades working with more than 200 national and internationally renowned visiting artists at Brandywine. He was the master printer for artists such as Jacob Lawrence, Paul F. Keene, Jr., Kenneth Noland, Jules Olitski, Sam Gilliam, and Barbara Chase-Riboud.\n\nFranklin was a man of diverse experience and talents. Among his favorite artistic accomplishments was drumming for the Ile Ife Center for the Arts and Humanities and the Arthur Hall Afro-American Dance Ensemble.\n\n—Adapted from https://www.phillytrib.com/obituaries/robert-warren-franklin-81/article_1b8ae81d-3c03-5ace-b6a2-f0bd4745cfe2.html and https://www.inquirer.com/philly/obituaries/20120801_Bob_Franklin__81__master_printer_of_fine_art.html, accessed 6-22-2021"
