        "text": "Career\n\nIn the early to mid-1990s Smoove performed stand-up comedy at the Uptown Comedy Club in Harlem, New York City, and he toured comedy clubs on the East Coast. Smoove made his television debut on the stand-up comedy series Def Comedy Jam in 1992. Comedian Louis C.K. cast him in the role of Trucky in the cult-favourite comedy movie Pootie Tang (2001). Smoove was also a cast member of the short-lived sketch comedy TV series Cedric the Entertainer Presents (2002–03), and he landed a job as a staff writer and bit-part actor on the sketch comedy show Saturday Night Live in 2003. When the show declined to renew his contract in 2006, Smoove fired both of his talent agents in an attempt to reset his career.\n\nThat same year, he traveled to Los Angeles to attend the funeral of his music producer friend Oji Pierce, and while in town he tried out for the role of Leon Black on Curb Your Enthusiasm. At the audition, he approached Larry David, the show’s star and creator, and said, “Let’s do this, baby. Let’s improv. I may mess around and slap you in the face. Anything could happen, Larry.” Smoove joined the cast in 2007. On the show, his character is part of a family from New Orleans that has lost its home after Hurricane Katrina, and David and his wife have taken the family in. Black was not supposed to be a recurring character, but Smoove earned a regular role after demonstrating his quick-witted comic instincts and on-screen chemistry with David. He has described Black as someone who gives bad advice that, often by chance, turns out to be good advice.\n\nIn addition, Smoove has served as a spokesperson for the sports betting company Caesars Sportsbook and appeared in television commercials for the sports apparel company Nike and the fast-food restaurant chain McDonald’s. Moreover, he has acted in several other movies, including the comedy Hall Pass (2011), the family comedy We Bought a Zoo (2011), the fantasy-comedy The Smurfs 2 (2013), and the action-drama Spider-Man: No Way Home (2021). He has also been cast in numerous other television shows, such as the situation comedy Everybody Hates Chris (2007–08), the comedy series ’Til Death (2008–10), the animated situation comedy American Dad! (2009–21), the comedy series The Millers (2013–15), the reality television parody series Real Husbands of Hollywood (2022), the comedy series Blockbuster (2022), and the sketch comedy series History of the World: Part II (2023)."
