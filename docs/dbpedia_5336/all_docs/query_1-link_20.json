        "text": "It’s that time of year again… When a travelling band of intrepid funny-makers hit the road and tickle Australian towns’ funny bones.\n\nThe ultimate comedy roadtrip, the Melbourne International Comedy Festival Roadshow, is headed to Bunbury with all it’s silly, satirical, side-splitting goodness, with a warning to young audiences of it’s potentially offensive nature.\n\nIn his chat with The Mail, the writer, director, actor and comedian said he’s loving being back on the road again.\n\n“I’ve just finished the Tasmanian leg of the tour, and I’m about to go and do three gigs in country Victoria and then the WA leg,” he said.\n\n“It’s a good crack, travelling around with a bunch of idiots, having a laugh and eating and drinking.\n\n“People can expect a complete load of nonsense from this show. They won’t be any the wiser when they leave.”\n\n\"I decided to become a comedian when I found out I couldn’t do anything else,” he laughed.\n\n“You know how it is, you have a few drinks and a few laughs and some idiot tells you to get up on stage and do it and my course was set.\n\n“And now I’ve been a part of the comedy festival since about 1992. It’s a joy to take the show to places where they don’t usually get things like that, it’s an absolute pleasure.”\n\nAmong his accolades, Franklin has been twice nominated for the Melbourne International Comedy Festival Barry Award and has won both the MICF Piece of Wood Award and the Sunday Age Best Comedy Show of the Year Award.\n\nAnd yet despite his long list of stand-up awards, his favourite joke is one he describes as ‘quite simple’.\n\n“Our local icecream man was found dead in his van the other day, covered in rainbow sprinkles and chocolate sauce. The police say he topped himself,” he laughed.\n\nFranklin’s television and film work includes Bad Eggs, The Librarians, Stupid, Stupid Man, Please Like Me, Jack Irish and Thank God You’re Here.\n\nA decorated comedic icon, he has also written and directed two short suspense films. He most recently directed two episodes of Little Lunch for the ABC and Frank Woodley’s stage show I, Woodley.\n\nHe followed up his Australian Shadows Literary Award-winning 2010 collection of short stories Under Stones with the release of his first novel Moving Tigers in 2015.\n\nHis next project, The Whole Picture, is due out later this year."
