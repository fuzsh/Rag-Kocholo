        "text": "Every time a town or city changes its name, thousands of residents have to be convinced to undergo the inconvenience…so there's usually a story to tell. Some towns are cashing in, like Jim Thorpe, Pennsylvania and Truth or Consequences, New Mexico. Others are running away from a problematic past (to wit: Sexmoan in the Philippines). The most recent addition to the trend is the quiet English town of Staines, which got tired of being a comedy punch line.\n\nAli G was British television's favorite gangsta.\n\nBritish comedian Sacha Baron Cohen made it big in America as a title-confused Kazakh in the 2006 movie Borat, but in the U.K. he was already well-known for playing a different character: Ali G, the fictional host of Da Ali G Show. In his trademark patois, half hip-hop and half Jamaican, Ali G would brag about coming up \"in da heart of da Staines ghetto\" and leading a local street gang, \"Da West Staines Massive.\"\n\nStaines was better known for its linoleum than its rap scene.\n\nThe joke, which a British viewer would have understood instantly, was that Ali G wasn't \"hard\" at all, he was Alistair Lester Graham, a middle-class white boy playing at thug life. Far from being an urban ghetto, Staines is a suburban market town near Heathrow Airport, best known over the years for its linoleum factory. It has a lovely Victorian town hall and a market street of charming Georgian shophouses. The town is old; its manor was mentioned in the 11th-century Domesday Book, and Sir Thomas More was tried there in 1535.\n\nCan a comedy bit lower property values?\n\nSome residents of Staines didn't appreciate their historically reputable town being besmirched in comedy sketches. They evidently didn't get the point of the joke: Sasha Baron Cohen used Staines as Ali G's hometown precisely because of its amiable respectability. But no matter! A local business forum thought that Baron Cohen's joke was lowering property values. \"There’s no doubt Ali G put Staines on the map—but for all the wrong reasons,\" said the forum chairman. \"He put the stain in Staines.\"\n\nStaines, upon Thames, is now Staines-upon-Thames.\n\nIn 2012, the business forum convinced the borough council to make the switch, and at 2 p.m. on May 20, the town celebrated with a maypole dance and regatta as the name was officially changed. The local football club complained loudly that the new name was \"pretentious\"—but to no avail. Staines is now Staines-upon-Thames. I wonder if Kazakhstan has considered a name change as well, to get rid of the Borat-inflicted stains upon its reputation."
