        "text": "Stone, Robert “Bob” Franklin\n\nIn every aspect of his life, was a leader by example. As a student, athlete, pianist, teacher, school administrator, community volunteer, parent and grandparent, his quiet confidence and sense of humour inspired those around him to try, as he did, to be their best selves.\n\nBob was born in Karuizawa, Japan in 1937 to missionary parents who passed on their belief in the principle of doing one’s best for others, a legacy that is being carried forward by his children and grandchildren. Before the tragic death of his father, Alfred, in a Japanese ferry disaster - which claimed almost as many lives as those lost on the Titanic - Bob and his brother Don had crossed the Pacific 5 times, and this early experience with travel stayed with him throughout his life.\n\nHe met his wife Judy in Italy in 1963 during a course in archaeology and classical culture. Both returned frequently to Italy to further explore the country together. Once they had children, he and Judy would camp across Canada and the U.S. every summer, often with extended family as well. Once their children were independent, Bob and Judy started traveling regularly overseas. The hiking trails of Mallorca became a favourite destination. There were also three trips to Japan, one of which involved being volunteer English teachers in Hokkaido for three months.\n\nVolunteering was always a priority. Bob participated at the board level in many organizations, including the North Toronto Youth Project, the Red Door Shelter in Toronto, and the Boys and Girls Club on Grand Manan. For 20 years, he was also the coordinator of “Friends of Grand Manan Trails”. As recognition for his contribution to the Grand Manan community, he was honored with the Rotary Club Paul Harris award as well as a New Brunswick Merit award.\n\nFrom a one-room school in Appin, Ontario during WWII, the American School in Tokyo, and secondary school at North Toronto Collegiate, Bob had a varied academic experience. He earned a BA and MA in Classics from Victoria College U of T. These were followed by a teaching degree, which led to his professional career as a teacher at North Toronto, the Head of Classics at Northview Heights, and an administrator for the Peel Board.\n\nThe students and staff of South Peel Chinguacousy and North Peel were the beneficiaries of his leadership for 20 years. One of his colleagues even introduced him to an audience as “the most humane educator in Peel”. Throughout those years, he coached both Boys and Girls basketball teams to several championships, once demonstrating his commitment to school discipline by suspending his top player on the day of a crucial game! Many former staff were still contacting him 30 years after his retirement, some still addressing him as “Sir”, which was a source of amusement for him.\n\nBob was also a gifted musician. At age 13, he was mastering Mozart’s 23rd piano concerto in preparation for a performance with a string quartet in Tokyo. Although plans were interrupted by his return to Canada, he continued to study piano to a grade 10 level but couldn’t give up sports to devote more time towards a performance degree. However, he never stopped playing by note or by ear and enjoyed being the pianist for United and Anglican Church services on Grand Manan, his and Judy’s Island home from 1998 onwards. His perfect pitch was also invaluable to the bass section in church and community choirs in both Toronto and Grand Manan.\n\nBob also had a love of racquet sports that began at age 9, with his first tennis racquet. From then, until age 77, he played tennis with friends and family, winning a few club championships and one provincial tournament along the way. At age 85, he fell on the pickleball court. While this forced him to give up active participation, he would still give backhand tips to grandchildren (one hand on the walker while demonstrating the proper swing) and analyze the pros on TV.\n\nBy far, the most important part of Bob’s life was family, which consisted of his four children, their spouses/partners, seven grandchildren, the Huntsville Lawsons, and the Toronto Douglasses/Greens. He and Judy loved spending time with all of them during their visits to Grand Manan and when he and Judy were in Toronto, whether for Christmas or while enroute to various overseas destinations.\n\nIn 2018, when a pain in his shoulder hampered his devastating backhand, Bob was diagnosed with multiple myeloma. The first round of immunotherapy treatment was so effective, however, that for 5 years he was able to continue playing pickleball and, in the spring of 2023, he and Judy were able to celebrate the 60th anniversary of their first meeting by spending three weeks in Tuscany.\n\nWhen the cancer became active again, Bob chose to make the most of the time he had left, enjoying what he was still able to do: cryptic crosswords, Wordle, and keeping track of the birds and the boats visible from the living room window. He also took on a challenge to walk 100 km, one km at a time, in support of a refurbished trail in the neighbouring provincial park. When another fall interrupted that effort, his seven grandchildren finished it for him.\n\nAll of his close family - Judy, Bill, Dave (Donna Bonnenfant), Tim (Alli Scott), Jennifer (Leo Alefounder), Max, Caleigh, Kyla, Annabel, Sophie, Nate, Lucas, Sue Sedgwick, the West Coast Stones, the Huntsville Lawsons, and the Greens - grieve this loss, but celebrate Bob and a life that was well-lived from start to finish with his characteristic compassion, humour, courage and grace.\n\nCremation has taken place, a funeral service on Grand Manan will take place on Saturdqay, August 17th, 2024 at 1:30 pm at the Church of the Ascension, North Head and a celebration of life in Toronto will take place at a later date, details will be announced in the near future.\n\nFor those who wish donations to the Grand Manan Hospital Foundation, Charlotte County Cancer, Friends of Grand Manan Trails, Grand Manan Boys & Girls Club or to any local charity of the donor’s choice would be appreciated by the family.\n\nOnline condolences to the family or donations can be made at www.humphreysfh.com\n\nArrangements have been entrusted to the care & direction of the Phillip Ells Jr. Memorial Funeral Centre, a service of Humphreys Funeral Home, 20 Marks St. St. Stephen, NB E3L 2B2 (506 – 466 – 3110)"
