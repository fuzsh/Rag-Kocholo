        "text": "It is with heavy hearts that we announce the passing of Bobby Franklin, Sr., who peacefully departed this life at Maury Regional Medical Center in Columbia, Tennessee. Bobby was born on\n\nOctober 15, 1944, in Greeneville, Tennessee, to the late Toney and Mae Franklin.\n\nBobby cherished the simple joys of life, finding immense pleasure in playing golf, cheering on his favorite football teams, and relishing moments with his family, especially at the river and\n\nduring movie nights watching John Wayne classics.\n\nHe is survived by his loving children Bobby Franklin Jr., Patsy Horne, Keith Osborne and his extended family members: Phyllis Luttrell, Sue Morlock, Betty Franklin, Cal Franklin, CB Franklin, Dale Franklin, Juanita Thigpen, Sue Smith, Jay Smith, Jackie Cox, and Glenda Cox. Bobby also leaves behind several cherished grandchildren and great-grandchildren.\n\nHe is preceded in death by his partner: Carol Gannon who was his partner for over 40 years and his parents.\n\nBobby Franklin, Sr. will be fondly remembered for his warm heart, infectious laughter, and unwavering love for his family and friends. His presence will be deeply missed by all who had the privilege of knowing him.\n\nMay his soul rest in eternal peace, and may his memory continue to bring comfort to those who mourn his loss."
