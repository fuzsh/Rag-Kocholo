Bev Killick is from the bold and brassy school of stand up, delivering a non-stop energetic set every time. As soon as she blastâs her way on stage, you know youâre in for a treat. Bev is likeable, bawdy and real.

Bev started making people laugh from the age of ten, at family gatherings. Invariably these gatherings would end up with Bev putting on a show. Always the class clown and lunch time entertainer, Bevâs ability to remember a joke (handed down from her Dad at the meatworks) and tell it well , saw her doing Stand Up Comedy in the school quadrangle long before she knew that it would be her calling.
