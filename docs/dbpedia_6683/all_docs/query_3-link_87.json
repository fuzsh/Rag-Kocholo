Garrett\n\nPrevious * * * Index * * * Next\n\nMy name is James R. \"Rube\" Garrett. I was a Corporal, ammo chief for I Battery, 3rd Battalion, 11th Regiment and a charter member of the 1st Marine Division, formed in Cuba in 1940. The following are my diary entries for the Battle of Guadalcanal. A glance through the pages shows while we were there, 59 enemy air raids flew in. That doesn't include many false alarms and numerous shellings from Japanese battleships, destroyers and cruisers. It seemed like about an air raid or shelling every day for three and a half months. I remember a lot of diving into ditches and ducking in and out of bomb shelters, or whatever we could find to hide under.\n\nThe entry for August 28, 1942, just three weeks after the landing, reads \"...to date, have seen 133 Jap planes fall and some 20 odd ships sunk.\" Many more would follow.\n\nThese figures are by no means complete. Some pages of my diary were blank because we were just too busy shooting or being shot at. We were scared a lot of the time. The weeks and months of anxiety and tension...long days of tedious work, night watches at the edge of the jungle suddenly punctuated by sheer terror are only hinted at - if you can read between the lines. What is there are the impressions of a young 20 year old Marine just as they were written 53 years ago. They detail the war in the Solomons as I lived it...one day at a time.\n\nRube Garrett at Paris Island, September 28, 1941 * * *\n\nWe sailed from San Francisco on June 22, 1942. I had just turned 20, and the South Pacific was a long way from Edinburg, Texas, where I had grown up. Twenty-two days later we landed in Wellington, New Zealand. It was July 12. We stayed there for a couple of weeks where we, along with 10 or 12 thousand other Marines unloaded our ship, the Erickson, and loaded onto the Marine Transport USS McCauley.\n\nPreparing for combat, we made several long hikes in New Zealand to keep us conditioned for what lay ahead. We left New Zealand on the 21st of July, sailed around the Pacific and made practice landings on the Fiji Islands. We would disembark from the ship, climb down the nets, onto the Higgins Boats and go in toward the beach. But we never actually landed. We would then turn around and return to the ship. We were informed on August 3rd at a non-commissioned officers conference there, by Lt. Bradbury (later to become Captain), I Battery Commander, that we were to land on Guadalcanal in the Solomon Islands. We were going into battle. Ammunition was issued to all and we spent the rest of the time loading ammunition belts and getting prepared for combat. On August 6, we were ready.\n\nAugust 10, 1942\n\nWe had machine gun attacks from the rear. Returned fire for 1500 rounds. Today, drew and belted 50 cal. and issued more 30 cal. ammunition.\n\nAugust 11, 1942\n\nMachine gunned again. Sgt. Windish, our Instrument Section sergeant, was killed accidentally by one of our officers. Went on two hour patrol with Sgt. Voelker. To river to bathe and saw two prisoners. A friend of mine, Casey from Headquarters' Battery, was killed in the night, I think by friendly fire.\n\n\"Sgt. Windish was killed accidentally by his own officer, who was the Instrument Section Commander, with whom he was bunking. He had left the bunker and, on returning, frightened the man inside who shot him two times with a 45 caliber pistol. Both men were gone before daylight - we never saw nor heard of the officer again.\"\n\nAugust 12, 1942\n\nInfantry reinforcements at night. We were attacked again about dawn. Also, naval shelling by subs. Burned off the airfield. Snipers at dark. Bombers flew over again.\n\n\"We had to burn off all the tall Johnson type grass on Henderson Field - Japanese snipers were using it to slip in amongst us at night. They would strap a light machine gun to one man's back. He would run and lay down -- they would fire a few rounds then he would jump up and the gun would move to another position.\"\n\nJapanese Knee Mortar\n\nAugust 13, 1942\n\nSnipers again. Infantry in field. No casualties. Working parties and our first hot chow in several days.\n\nAugust 14, 1942\n\nSnipers again. The infantry was firing all night. Working party for Lt. Williams at Regimental ammo dump. Air raid and the first anti-aircraft fire. Got sub with 105 Howitzer!\n\n* Our anti-aircraft guns had just been set up. A submarine had surfaced and began firing on transports. 11th Regiment Howitzers on the beach opened up on the sub.\n\n90mm anti-aircraft gun\n\n* * *\n\nAfter the first week on Guadalcanal, the 3rd Battalion, 11th Marines were finally settled around the edge of Henderson Field.\n\nThe \"Pagoda\" at Henderson Field\n\nIn the daytime we were under the protection of the edge of the jungle. The trees sheltered us from 'Pistol Pete' which was a Japanese Naval artillery piece that was on tracks in the hills. It would fire two or three rounds - firing at random all hours of the day - and then would be rolled back into a cave where it was well camouflaged. It was eventually located and destroyed a few months later.\n\nAt dusk, where we were protected by darkness, we would move our Howitzers onto the open airfield and point in the direction of the hills - towards Grassy Knoll, Bloody Ridge and Kukombona. In the open we could fire in any direction. Then, before daylight, we would pull back under the trees\n\nThe big disadvantage of living on the airfield as we did was that it made us a part of the main target - which was the airfield and aircraft - so that every enemy plane or ship that got within range either shot at us or dropped bombs on us. We were very fortunate not to have had lots more casualties than we did.\n\n\"I was acting section chief throughout the whole Guadalcanal engagement...one of the largest sections in the battery. I had twenty-one or twenty-two guys in my section. Each battery had ten or twelve or fifteen trucks and jeeps. Take those jeeps and tie a 75 Howitzer behind the jeep and carry a gun crew on it...a lot of times the gun crew would have to get off the jeep to help cross a stream; you'd have to break the gun down and carry it across piece by piece. I imagine those Howitzers weighed a couple of thousand pounds. It would take three or four men to carry the barrell and the main block and so on.\n\nEach battery had four Howitzers, four gun crews and a machine gun section to protect the guns...and that was my section: machine guns and ammo. I had to keep the guns supplied. My boys had to haul...they'd be called for ammunition during a mission and we had to deliver ammunition. Anybody got short of ammunition they'd holler \"Garrett!\" (laughs).\n\nWe had one ton trucks...early on I was a driver, a Private; it took me eight months to make Pfc. and eighteen months to make Corporal at Camp Lejeune. As section chief I should have been a Sergeant, but for some reason advancement in the Marines was slow. Just before we left Camp Lejeune they were going around asking us if we wanted to apply for officer's school, but a lot of us 'tough guys' said \"Hell no, I don't want to be an officer.\"\n\n* * *\n\nAugust 15, 1942\n\nQuiet except for infantry. Have been hearing firing from the front lines. Rained from 4am till dawn. Wrote letter. A B-17 from Australia flew overhead and were we glad to see it! We had a working party at the beach. And cards.\n\nB-17 Flying Fortress on Reconnaisance Patrol\n\nAugust 16, 1942\n\nCard playing. Church held by C.O. Van Orman. Went to river for bath. Pretty quiet during the day.\n\nMarines and native scouts at the fallen tree in the Lunga River\n\n\"We always went to the river to bathe - the Lunga River - it was only knee deep...fresh running water. We'd go in there and strip off. There was a big old tree, it was laying down in the river. We would wash our clothes in there and all, lay them on a limb while we swam. And one time I come back in to the battery and a bomb had fell into I Battery. Five of our guys were hit but none were killed and they all returned to duty. But every now and then we'd see a dead Jap floating in the river. That's the river we fished with hand grenades.\"\n\nAugust 17, 1942\n\nNight was quiet. Working party at Regimental ammo dump. River for bath. Saw three prisoners and three natives. One Jap plane was overhead all day.\n\nAugust 18, 1942\n\nRained all night, not a shot fired. Sgt. Corrigan slept in our bunker with Kidd and myself. We were the only dry ones in battery. We registered on a Jap village in the hills. Eight bombers flew over. Bombs fell on the air field and got some of our boys. Like to have got us. Raining again.\n\nTypical shelter built from scavenged wood\n\n\"The Japanese pre-fabbed a three foot by six foot board arrangement framed with two by twos and planks on the top which we could lay on top of the ground or in our holes and make a bed. They also had a sand bag that was woven grass bags of some kind or other and we'd cut them open and spread them on top and use them for padding on top of these boards which we used for beds. The boards really helped...we made good use of whatever the Japanese left behind.We had all of these three by sixes put together about as big as our tent covers. So we had a wooden floor under our tent. When somebody would walk across the floor in those boondockers, with those steel plated heels, sound like a horse walking across a wooden deck.\""
