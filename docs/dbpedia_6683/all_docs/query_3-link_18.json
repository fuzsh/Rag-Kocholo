        "text": "On August 7, 1942 war correspondent Richard Tregaskis took part in the US Marine invasion of Guadalcanal. His experiences became the basis for a book entitled Guadalcanal Diary. A year later, director Lewis Seiler made a film of the book which captured, as closely as possible, the actual experiences of the men who took part in the battle...at least on the Allied side.\n\nThe Movie\n\nBeing based on a series of war reports, the film has a great sense of pace and maintains coherence despite its episodic nature. The narration by Reed Hadley helps tie things together. It begins with a lazy day aboard the transport and we get to learn a lot about the characters in the two before the landing. Once the landing starts, the action heats up. Equal parts of sorrow and humor fill in the short time between the battle sequences. The big moment of the movie comes when the first Marine platoon is obliterated at Matanikau. When the Marines go back to Matanikau a second time, things get even bigger.\n\nSince the movie was made during the height of the war, the Japanese are treated more harshly by the filmmakers than the Marines. Despite a few stiff moments, most of the acting is surprisingly natural. William Bendix turns in an incredibly funny and touching performance as a former Brooklyn cab driver (creatively named \"Taxi\") and Anthony Quinn does an equally good job as Private Jesus \"Soose\" Alvarez, the lone survivor haunted by memories of Matanikau. Other notable cast members include Preston Foster and Lloyd Nolan.\n\n8 out of 10\n\nThe Video\n\nIt's a sixty-year-old movie so you have to come in expecting a fair amount of distortion and noise in the picture. Lines, scratches and pops appear throughout the movie. Blacks are inconsistent and not quite dark enough. Contrast problems are caused by lots of guys dressed in olive and khaki running around on beaches. This transfer is certainly the best I've seen of the film, but it still leaves a lot to be desired.\n\n6 out of 10\n\nThe Audio\n\nMono and stereo? I must be living in some sort of futuristic wonderland! All things considered, Guadalcanal Diary has a solid audio track. Good music (including quite a bit of good old fashioned Marine sing-a-longs) is probably the high point, but the battle sounds are almost as enjoyable.\n\n6 out of 10\n\nThe Extras\n\nAs usual in this series, there's not much here beyond the movie itself. There are a few decent trailers on the disc (including one for The Sand Pebbles and Von Ryan's Express) but that's about it.\n\n3 out of 10"
