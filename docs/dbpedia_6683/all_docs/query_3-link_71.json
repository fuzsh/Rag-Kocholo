        "text": "by Richard Tregaskis\n\nRandom House Â 1943, 1955\n\nSoftcover\n\n214 pages\n\nphotos, maps\n\nISBN: none\n\nCover Price: out of print\n\nLanguage: English\n\nOrder now at amazon.com\n\nReturn to\n\nBook Reviews\n\nMain Menu\n\nGuadalcanal Diary\n\nThis celebrated classic gives a soldier's-eye-view of the Guadalcanal battles--crucial to World War II, the war that continues to fascinate us all, and to military history in general. Unlike some of those on Guadalcanal in the fall of 1942, Richard Tregaskis volunteered to be there.\n\nTregaskis was an on-location news correspondent at the time one of only two on Guadalcanal. who lived alongside the Marines sleeping on the ground--only to be awoken by air raids--eating the sometimes meager rations, and braving some of the most dangerous battlefields of World War II. He more than once narrowly escaped the enemy's fire, and so we have this incisive and exciting inside account of the groundbreaking initial landing of U.S. troops on Guadalcanal. Green cloth-bound hardcover with dark-red Marine Corps emblem to the front panel and red and black type to the spine in a pictorial dust jacket.\n\nThe final chapter of the book covers Tregaskis departing Guadalcanal as a passenger aboard a B-17 Flying Fortress that took off September 26 from Henderson Field on a mission over southern Bougainville, then flew to New Hebrides departing the war zone. After the release of Guadalcanal Diary, adapted as a Hollywood Movie Guadalcanal Diary (Film) released in theaters during 1943. In 1955, the book was revised and reprinted as an updated version.\n\nReview by Â Justin Taylan Â\n\nReturn to Book Reviews | Add a review or submit for review\n\nLast Updated\n\nSeptember 21, 2023"
