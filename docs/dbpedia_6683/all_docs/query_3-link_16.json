This strikingly realistic film follows a devoted platoon of Marines through the terrors of war in the South Pacific.\n\nThe all-star cast includes LLOYD NOLAN, WILLIAM BENDIX, PRESTON FOSTER and ANTHONY QUINN as soldiers battling disease, treacherous terrain and unrelenting weather, as well as a human enemy. Poignantly narrated, and with explosive action rooted in an actual historical context, Guadalcanal Diary is action-packed entertainment from beginning to end."
