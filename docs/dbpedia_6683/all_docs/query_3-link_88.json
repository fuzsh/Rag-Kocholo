Johnny 'Chicken' Anderson:\n\nYeah, but where *are* our planes?\n\nCpl. Aloysius T. 'Taxi' Potts:\n\nMaybe if we keep digging we'll come up someplace around Ebbets Field.\n\nPvt. Johnny 'Chicken' Anderson:\n\nYeah, I'm practically standing on second base right now.\n\nCpl. Aloysius T. 'Taxi' Potts:\n\nHey, Tex.\n\nPvt. Tex Mcllvoy:\n\nYeah?\n\nCpl. Aloysius T. 'Taxi' Potts:\n\nHot, ain't it?\n\nPvt. Tex Mcllvoy:\n\nYeah. Hotter'n a Texas cattle call in August.\n\nGunnery Sgt. Hook Malone:\n\nSo you think it's hot, do ya?\n\nCpl. Aloysius T. 'Taxi' Potts:\n\nYeah.\n\nGunnery Sgt. Hook Malone:\n\nHow'd you like a nice tall glass of ice cold beer?\n\nCpl. Aloysius T. 'Taxi' Potts:\n\nBeer! Strictly a middle class beverage. The last time I was back in Brooklyn, there was just such a night as this. We was havin' cocktails. My old lady brought 'em in, I took one taste, and boy what a kick. You know what she did?\n\nGunnery Sgt. Hook Malone:\n\nWhat?\n\nCpl. Aloysius T. 'Taxi' Potts:\n\nShe took 'em out and put in another slug of gin. [smiles] What a sweet old lady.\n\nCpl. Aloysius T. 'Taxi' Potts:\n\n[In dugout waiting out a heavy artillery barrage] I don't mind the one with my name on it. It's the one that says, 'To whom it may concern' that I don't like.\n\n[after the barrage increases]\n\nCpl. Aloysius T. 'Taxi' Potts:\n\nThey're throwing everything at us but the kitchen stove.\n\nGunnery Sgt. Hook Malone:\n\n[after an even louder explosion] That's the stove now!"
