        "text": "Guadalcanal Diary is a 1943 movie directed by Lewis Seiler starring Anthony Quinn and William Bendix. It is based on the book of the same name by Richard Tregaskis. Being a wartime production one can not expect an unbiased analysis of the fighting on Guadalcanal. It is more or less a propaganda vehicle, still it is a solid war movie.\n\nPQ of the DVD is very nice considering the age of the source material and it can be found very cheap too. The only noteworthy extra is a Theatrical Trailer.\n\nSynopsis from the DVD:\n\n‚ÄúSend In The Marines!\n\nBased on the best seller of the same name, Guadalcanal Diary is one of the greatest war movies of all time. This strikingly realistic film follows a devoted platoon of Marines through the terrors of war in the South Pacific.\n\nThe all-star cast includes Lloyd Nolan, William Bendix, Preston Foster and Anthony Quinn as soldiers battling disease, treacherous terrain and unrelenting weather, as well as a human enemy. Poignantly narrated, and with explosive action rooted in a solid historical context, Guadalcanal Diary is action-packed entertainment from beginning to end.‚Äù\n\nOf course being a movie from 1943 there was not much need for crappy repro gear üòÄ Interestingly the packs are assembled correctly (contrary to HBOs The Pacific) and you can see various hunting knives in use which is a cool detail. All in all a good representation of the early USMC gear. Sadly the gear of the Japanese side is quite horrible for the most part, wrong helmets, wrong weapons, well almost wrong everything\n\nInteresting Japanese Machinegun üòÜ\n\nTrailer, quality is quite bad unfortunately. PQ of the DVD is much much better\n\nSome nice colorized lobby cards:"
