        "text": "Today, Sunday July 26th 1942,\n\nis a peaceful, lazy day of rest\n\nhere on our transport\n\nsomewhere in the South Pacific.\n\nAnd very pleasant it is too, here in the\n\nbeautiful white sunshine of the port deck\n\nwith the blue panel of the sea to watch\n\nand a good song rising clear.\n\nWhere Father Donnelly, Notre Dame 1917,\n\nall-American fullback for two years,\n\nnow simply Chaplain Donnelly,\n\nis working the second shift.\n\nSay, Sammy, your voice is OK.\n\nWhy not? My father was\n\na cantor in the synagogue.\n\nWe\"re on the signal bridge, where\n\nColonel Grayson and his staff are relaxing,\n\nas contented as if seated on their front\n\nporches of a Sunday morning back home.\n\nWhat a way to travel to war.\n\nl wish we had the funnies.\n\nSo we could see if Mammy Yokum\n\ngot the termites out of the turnip patch.\n\nHowever the favourite occupation,\n\nas usual, is shooting the breeze.\n\nExchanging scuttlebutt.\n\nBoy, l\"d sure like to be back home,\n\nsailing me a boat on Chesapeake Bay.\n\nlf l was back home l wouldn\"t be on no boat.\n\nlf l was back in Laredo\n\nl\"d go and see my Conchita.\n\n- Maybe Lolita.\n\n- Well, make up your mind.\n\nAll right, Conchita.\n\nAnd Lolita.\n\nEbbets Field, that\"s for me.\n\nWatching them beautiful Bums.\n\nBums is right.\n\n- Just leading the league.\n\n- Oh, sure. That league.\n\nGot any dough which says\n\nthe Yanks will take us in the Series?\n\nThe Dodgers ain\"t even in it yet.\n\nWhat good\"ll dough do where you\"re going?\n\n- How do you know where we\"re going?\n\n- Oh, pipe down.\n\nBesides, l don\"t care\n\nif l never see any more dough again.\n\nOf course, you monkeys understand\n\nl\"m talking about Confederate dough.\n\nSay, ain\"t you a war correspondent?\n\n- That\"s right.\n\n- Put my name in the paper.\n\nThe funny paper.\n\n- Sure. What is it?\n\n- Johnny Anderson.\n\nYou can call him Chicken.\n\nHe\"s just sprouting his pinfeathers.\n\nA certain party l know\n\nwill get a kick out of that.\n\nYou know your mother\n\ndon\"t let you go out with no dames.\n\nPipe down, will you?\n\nl got him.\n\n(PA) Sweepers, man your brooms.\n\nClean sweep-down fore and aft.\n\nPleasant too to stretch out\n\nin the calm tropical night\n\nwith the lapping of the waves\n\nbeating a soft, faint obbligato to our song.\n\nThey\"re a great bunch of kids, Father.\n\n- They\"ll do all right.\n\n- Mm-hm.\n\nAny news yet as to where we\"re headed?\n\nEven the colonel doesn\"t know that.\n\nSo then l says \"\"Listen,\n\ndo you think what l\"m thinking?\"\"\n\nShe gives me one of them looks\n\nand says \"\"Yeah.\"\"\n\nThat\"s a tomato every time.\n\n- Writing to that babe of yours?\n\n- Why not?\n\n- Some doll, huh?\n\n- Yeah, she\"s a real hunk of woman.\n\n- And she don\"t give me no arguments either.\n\n- She don\"t, huh?\n\nYou know, l had me a dame like that once.\n\nBut so did a lot of other guys.\n\n- Good night, Chicken.\n\n- Good night, Taxi.\n\nOK, boys.\n\nCome on, come on.\n\nCut out the skylarking. Hit the sack.\n\nLights out, one minute.\n\nHey, Sergeant.\n\nDo you know yet what we\"re up to?\n\nOh, the same old thing - manoeuvres.\n\nDon\"t say l told you.\n\nUp and down landing nets,\n\nin and out of boats - l\"m geting tired of this.\n\nThe way you looked at Onslow Beach\n\nyou could stand plenty of practice.\n\nOne of these days we\"re gonna\n\nrun up against the real thing.\n\n- Hey, Tex.\n\n- Yeah.\n\n- Hot, ain\"t it?\n\n- Yeah.\n\nHoter than a Texas catle car in August.\n\n- So you think it\"s hot, do you?\n\n- Yeah.\n\nHow would you like\n\na nice tall glass of ice-cold beer?\n\nBeer. Strictly a middle-class beverage.\n\nThe last time l was in Brooklyn\n\nit was just such a night as this.\n\nWe was having cocktails.\n\nThe old lady brought them in,\n\nl took one taste, and boy, what a kick.\n\n- You know what she did?\n\n- What?\n\nShe took \"em out and\n\nput in another slug of gin.\n\n- What a sweet old lady.\n\n- Yeah.\n\n- Well, good night, Taxi.\n\n- Good night.\n\nYes, this has been a peaceful, lazy day of rest\n\nalmost everywhere on the ship.\n\nDespite the fact that tomorrow or the next day\n\nwe\"ll know where we\"re headed.\n\nWhere possibly we may be wounded or die\n\non some Japanese beachhead.\n\n- What\"s going on?\n\n- l don\"t know.\n\n- Where\"d they come from?\n\n- Look at \"em.\n\nls that a task force for ya!\n\nHow many are there?\n\nMust be about a thousand.\n\n- So we\"re out on manoeuvres, eh?\n\n- My eye. Looks like the real McCoy.\n\n- Where\"s Jordan? He\"ll know the answer.\n\n- Jordan, come here.\n\nGive us the lowdown. What are they?\n\nThe Pepsi-Cola. The llluscious.\n\n- Boy, that\"s a heap of \"em.\n\n- Now if we only knew where we were going.\n\nLooks like we mean business, Colonel.\n\nlt\"s a cheerful thought to be going into this\n\nwith all this power and force behind us.\n\n- What\"s this coming?\n\n- That\"s the FCPL.\n\nThey got a civilian with them.\n\nHow do you do, Mr Weatherby?\n\nl\"m Colonel Grayson.\n\n- Dispatches, sir.\n\n- Well, now maybe we\"ll find out something.\n\n- Tokyo?\n\n- Could be.\n\nGentlemen, we\"re going to atack\n\nthe Japanese strongholds\n\non Guadalcanal and Tulagi\n\nin the Solomon lslands.\n\nGuadalcanal?\n\nThe Navy and Coast Guard will put us ashore.\n\nOnce established, our objective is an airfield\n\nwhich the enemy has almost completed.\n\nMr Weatherby, who has supervised\n\na copra plantation there,\n\nwill tell you some of the difficulties\n\nyou may expect to encounter.\n\nWell, fellas, this is\n\na detailed map of Guadalcanal.\n\nAfter crossing the beach\n\nyou\"ll have to penetrate a field of grass\n\nfrom four to six feet high - and it\"s\n\ngood stuff for the Japs to hide in too.\n\n\"\"Headquarters, fifth regiment, first marine\n\ndivision, fleet marine force, 26th July 1942.\"\"\n\n\"\"From Colonel Wallace E Grayson, USMC,\n\nto all members of this command.\"\"\n\n\"\"Subject:\n\nmission of this force.\"\"\n\n\"\"The coming action marks the first offensive\n\ninvolving ground forces of the US.\"\"\n\n- \"\"The marines are to initiate this action...\"\"\n\n- Ain\"t it always the way?\n\n\"\"..which will prove the forerunner of\n\nsuccessive offensive actions\n\nthat will end in ultimate victory\n\nfor our cause.\"\"\n\nAnd all we have to do to prove it\n\nis to get shot at.\n\n- \"\"We have worked hard for this action...\"\"\n\n- He\"s telling us.\n\n\"\"..and l have every confidence in our ability\n\nand desire to force our will upon the enemy.\"\"\n\n- He took the words right out of my mouth.\n\n- \"\"We meet a tough and wily opponent.\"\"\n\n\"\"But he is not sufficiently tough or wily\n\nto overcome us, because we are marines.\"\"\n\n- Now you\"re talking.\n\n- \"\"Each of us has a task.\"\"\n\n\"\"Let each vow to perform it\n\nto the utmost of his ability,\n\nwith added effort for good measure.\"\"\n\n\"\"Good luck and God bless you.\n\nGod favours the bold and strong of heart.\"\"\n\nWallace E Grayson.\n\n- Very well done, Hook.\n\n- Thank you, Brother Pots.\n\nlf l\"d only gone to high school...\n\nHey, what is this?\n\n\"\"Annexe E to general order\n\nnumber 3, paragraph D.\"\"\n\n\"\"Burial.\"\"\n\n\"\"Graves will be suitably marked.\n\nAll bodies will wear identification tags.\"\"\n\nMost of you have never had any experience in\n\nthe jungle before and the Japs have.
