        "text": "Richard Conte, who attained Hollywood stardom portraying gangsters and world‐weary heroes, died yesterday in Los Angeles as the result of a heart attack and paralyzing stroke. He was 59 years old and had been in intensive care for 13 days at the U.C.L.A. Medical Center.\n\nThe quiet actor who favored character roles during his more than 30 years on Broadway and in the movies, was probably, best known for his performance as a California fruit trucker in “Thieves' Highway,” in 1949.\n\nMost recently, Mr. Conte, who acted in about 50 films, played a minor role, that of Don Barzini, in “The Godfather.” Mr. Conte also turned to television, making appearances in such programs as “The Gambler” and “The Untouchables.”\n\nHe was named Nicholas Conte when he was born in March, 1916. The son of a Jersey City barber. But 20th Century Fox insisted his name be changed, preferably to Nicholas Conty. He compromised by changing his first name to Richard, believing, he told an interviewer, that as long as he held on to Conte his friends in Jersey City would not accuse him of having gone Hollywood.”\n\nMr. Conte once admitted that his only ambition as a young man was to make a lot of money in a hurry. After having worked as a clerk in Wall Street and as a trucker, Mr. Conte, in the summer of 1935, found himself waiting on tables in a restaurant that provided entertainment for the guests. This was the beginning of a successful acting career.\n\nWhen Eli Kazan and John Garfield of the Group Theater saw him act after serving the tables, they were so irnpressec that they offered him a scholarship at the Neighborhood Playhouse in New York.\n\nAfter two years at the playhouse and a series of supporting roles, some of which were on Broadway, Mr. Conte finally connected as an actor in “Jason.” In both “Jason” and “The Family,” he earned glowing reviews from the critics. This resulted in a movie contract with Fox.\n\nPlayed Flier and Spy\n\nAs a captured American flier on trial in Tokyo in “Purple Heart,” the Nazi spy in “113 Rue Madeleine” and as the hero of the “Slaves of Babylon,” Mr. Conte enjoyed a glamour of success.\n\nAmong his many films were “Guadalcanal Diary,” “Call Northside 777,” “Cry of the City,” “Hollywood Story,” “New York Confidential,” “Big Combo,” “Bengazi,” “I'll Cry Tomorrow,” “Full of Life,” “Brothers Rico,” “They Caine to Cordura,” “Assault on Queen,” “The Greatest Story Ever Told,” “Hotel” and “Oceans 11.”"
