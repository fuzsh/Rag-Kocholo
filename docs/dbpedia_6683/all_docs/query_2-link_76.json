        "text": "INTRODUCTION\n\nby Mark Bowden\n\nWar makes for great stories. It by definition involves matters of historical importance, and it is rivaled by few events in life for drama. It sounds mercenary for a writer to say so, but it has always been true. Stories about battle have been popular and significant since before language was written. Even poor accounts of it—self-serving memoirs, bald propaganda—often make for compelling reading, because the deeds of war, the cruelty and self-sacrifice, the cowardice and heroism, are enacted at such extremes of human experience that they ultimately transcend the words that describe them. The very best stories of war tend to come from writers who understand this, who know their place, who recognize that the struggle they observe and record carries a great deal more weight than their account of it ever will. Abraham Lincoln touched on this when he spoke at Gettysburg, The world will little note, nor long remember what we say here, but it can never forget what they did here. We have long remembered, of course, what Lincoln said, but even his immortal words carry less weight than the deeds of the men who fought and died. The great thing about words, however, is that they enable memory.\n\nRemembrance is the least we owe those who accomplished heroic deeds. Their stories are needed not only to inspire warriors who will be called upon to fight in the future, but to inspire us all with the best kind of national pride. In the words of the dying captain at the end of Saving Private Ryan, we are called upon to earn this.\n\nDuring World War II, America fought a famous series of vicious battles against the Japanese on islands in the Pacific. Richard Tregaskis went along as a war correspondent for the first of those battles, on the island of Guadalcanal, and wrote an account—his bestselling Guadalcanal Diary—that stands today as one of the best of its genre. Downplaying his own extraordinary heroism, writing with great fairness and restraint, Tregaskis shaped America’s understanding of the war, and influenced every account that came after, fiction or nonfiction, from Norman Mailer’s The Naked and the Dead to the 1998 film version of James Jones’ The Thin Red Line. Tregaskis described for the first time the look and feel and smell of the Pacific War, the oppressive tropical heat and humidity that caused rashes and strange fungi to appear on men’s bodies, the terror of fighting in tall grass and in jungles against an often invisible enemy that burrowed deep in the earth and vowed a fight to the death, the odd transformation of paradisiacal Pacific landscapes into hell itself. Tregaskis brought to life the horror of that fighting, but also the inspiring camaraderie of men at war, the humorous details of life in a combat zone, the peculiar juxtaposition of the macabre and the mundane. He demystified this strange new ground war. His account revealed the hardened, professional Japanese suicide warriors of legend to be merely human, cunning, determined fighters—men vulnerable to American artillery and infantry. Above all, Tregaskis captured the stoic young Americans who calmly boarded landing crafts, knowing that probably one in four of them would be killed. His diary captured the inspiring determination and courage of typical young Americans in 1943, a motley racial and ethnic mix, who would prove to be more than a match for the fierce Japanese.\n\nIt is hard to imagine today how important this book was when it appeared in that year, just months after the fighting it describes. The fighting in Guadalcanal was the beginning of the land offensive against Japan. Today we know all about the island-hopping strategy that, together with even more important air and sea battles, gradually stripped away Japan’s control of the Pacific Ocean and crushed its empire. Then, nothing was certain. The U.S. Navy had won a decisive battle in June in waters off Midway Island, but sea battles merely set the stage for the grim series of island invasions. As of August of that year, Americans had known only defeat on land against the Japanese—the ignominious flight of General Douglas MacArthur from the Philippines, the humiliating surrenders of Bataan and Corregidor. This book recorded a turning point. America was striking back.\n\nBut the diary records much more than a first American land victory. When it was published, no one yet knew what this new war was going to be like. The Allies had not yet landed on Normandy to begin the big push against Hitler, and although American soldiers had seen plenty of action already in Africa, and just weeks before had invaded Sicily, there was something especially daunting about invading a small island in a vast ocean, where neither side could readily abandon the field. What sort of enemy were these Japanese? What kind of weapons and strategies would they employ? Why were these dangerous islands with strange names halfway around the world suddenly so important? What had we gotten into?\n\nFrom a purely military standpoint, the most important battle of Guadalcanal was not the one fought on land and described so vividly in this book. It was fought at sea, miles away from the island, in November, months after Richard Tregaskis’ diary ends, when a decisive naval victory prevented the Japanese from landing reinforcements. The United States lost two cruisers and seven destroyers in that fight; the Japanese lost two battleships, one cruiser, two destroyers and, most important, ten troop transports. Preventing the arrival of those troops enabled the army and the stubborn, courageous Marines to finish mopping up Guadalcanal, securing their precious Henderson airfield, the first firm foothold on the long and bloody climb north toward Japan.\n\nAny doubts about how young Marines would fare in this new war were erased by their swift victory and stubborn defenses. Tregaskis rode in on one of the first landing crafts, sharing the profound chill of foreboding as the invading force approached the beaches, and the enormous relief when it was discovered that the Japanese had been taken completely by surprise. With the island’s defenders fleeing into the jungle, the landing itself was happily anticlimactic, but in the weeks that followed the fighting grew fierce. Tregaskis records the progress with calm daily entries in his diary, allowing the reader to experience the progress of the campaign just as the Marines did. There were so many acts of heroism, sacrifice, and survival to note that Tregaskis took to just listing them, encapsulating stories so remarkable that any one of them might have made a whole chapter. There’s Lieutenant Richard R. Amerine (of Lawrence, Kansas),\n\n… a Marine flyer, [who] came wandering into our lines today, thin as a ghost, to say he had been out in the jungles, dodging Japs and existing on red ants and snails for seven days.… Having once studied entomology, the science of bugs, he was able to subsist on selected ants and snails. He knew which ones were edible.\n\nOr two young corpsmen, Pharmacist’s Mate Alfred W. Cleveland (of South Dartmouth, Massachusetts) and Pharmacist’s Mate Second Class Karl B. Coleman (of McAndrews, Kentucky):\n\nThey told me how they had used a penknife to amputate the ragged stump of one Raider’s arm after it had been shattered by a 75 explosion … the medicos themselves had said that the man would have died if the two lads had not done such a good and quick job in the field.\n\nOr Lieutenant (JG) Paul F. Kalat (of Worchester, Massachusetts),\n\n… who had been the engineering officer on the Little. After his ship had sunk, he had spent some eight hours in the water, and the Jap warships, he said, just missed me by a whisker—about 25 to 35 feet.\n\nOne wishes that Tregaskis had more fully developed these tales. But he was less concerned with the stories of individuals than with the fate of the entire effort, on which everyone’s survival depended. Still, he refused to let these remarkable men and their deeds slip away unrecorded, and he always took care to note each man’s hometown, knowing how important these small stories would be to those waiting for word of their sons, husbands, fathers, and brothers back home, and how much these particular men deserved to be remembered. Tregaskis saw his role more simply than do most war correspondents today, who feel the need to explain the sources of conflicts, critique the judgment of statesmen and generals, and who, in the process, sometimes forget to record the experience of war itself through the eyes of those living and dying in it.\n\nGuadalcanal Diary is war reporting before the relationship between journalism and the military acquired its modern edge in Vietnam, where reporters were compelled to record the growing disparity between what they observed and what the U.S. military said was true. Tregaskis lived to report from that war, too, and by then he was regarded as little more than an apologist for the military. His was a voice from a different era, one in which the government and especially the military was held in the highest regard, even if GIs did gripe about the food and baffling wartime bureaucracy. His war, the one this book is about and the one that made him famous, had swept up the hearts and minds of an entire generation to an extent far greater than those of the generation in the sixties that protested against the Vietnam War. In 1943, young men were called upon to risk far more than their legal standing, or the threat of being tear-gassed on the Washington Mall. Guadalcanal Diary doesn’t question the importance of the war against Japan, and it doesn’t second-guess those sent to fight it. It is simply a story of war, free of artifice and irony. The Marines herein are presented uniformly as honest men doing their best in a terrible situation, which the vast majority of them were. Tregaskis’ prose is understated, but can occasionally soar:\n\nI sat on the edge of the dugout and watched the bright flashes of light rising high in the sky, heard the haughty, metallic voices of the cannon. Sitting like this, virtually in the lap of a shelling attack, one felt as if he were at the mercy of a great, vindictive giant whose voice was the voice of thunder; the awful colossal scale of modern war had brought the old gods to life again.\n\nTregaskis writes admiringly of the men at war he risked his life to watch, but Guadalcanal Diary is no whitewash. He straightforwardly records racist banter of young Marines steeling themselves for battle against an alien, feared enemy, dehumanizing the men they will be trying to kill. He tells of the trophy hunters who sliced ears off the dead and pried gold fillings from Japanese teeth to make necklaces, and of those who walked among the dead and dying Japanese on a beach after a battle, shooting them one by one to make certain they were all dead. Yet this is not a work of warmongering. It neither glorifies nor condemns the acts it describes, the acts of men in desperate straits, whose determination to survive and whose anger over the loss of their friends rapidly eclipsed moral restraint. Tregaskis’ warriors are not superhuman; they are just men, and this accords their accomplishment the stature it deserves. Likewise, the Japanese in his account are neither sub- nor superhuman. They fight with courage and determination, some with suicidal conviction. But they also flee in surprise when the Marines land in force, and spend most of the fight hiding from American guns. Even their vaunted code, death before the dishonor of surrender, was honored more in the breach:\n\nSeveral of the Jap prisoners captured on the ridge, it seems, said, Knife, when they were captured, and made hara-kiri motions in the region of the belly. But when no knife was forthcoming, they seemed relieved, and after that made no attempt to kill themselves.\n\nHistories of war, analyses and critiques of strategy and tactics, studies of political decision-making—these all have an important role to play, but to become literature, true stories must capture human experience at ground level. They must reach across space and time to re-create for each new reader the experience of an actual event. A confident writer knows when he has a story nailed at this level, and leaves the large-scale analyses for scholars, whose writing is important, but is meant primarily for each other. So John Hersey in Hiroshima and Michael Herr in Dispatches confine their accounts to actual human experience, a narrative decision that has given their work the power to speak directly to the heart. Guadalcanal Diary was long ago embraced by the U.S. Marine Corps and has become an indelible part of its tradition, but it is not included on most conventional lists of great literary nonfiction, where it also belongs. Tregaskis hazarded his life to get the story, and wrote one rich with observation, hard reporting work, and personal memory, some of it unforgettable:\n\nThe worst time in a bombing is the short moment when you can hear the bombs coming. Then you feel helpless, and you think very intensely of the fact that it is purely a matter of chance whether or not you will be hit.… You will also think about those who have been cruelly wounded or killed in previous bombings, and in your imagination you suffer the shock of similar wounds.… And while your mind is racing through these thoughts, your ears, without any conscious effort on your part, are straining to gauge the closeness of the bombs from the swishing and rattling of them.\n\nIt is writing that does what only literature can do: transport you to another time and place and acquaint you with emotions and sensations that you otherwise would never feel. It captures both the terrors and triumphs of war, its ugliness and also its awful beauty. Guadalcanal Diary deserves to be remembered more for Tregaskis’ book than the classic but sentimental film adaptation by Lewis Seiler. The book is invaluable as an accurate, ground-level account of a turning point in history, as a superb example of war reporting at its best, and as a lasting contribution to American literature. The Modern Library has done an important service by restoring it to print.\n\nI\n\nAPPROACH\n\nSUNDAY, JULY 26, 1942\n\nThis morning, it being Sunday, there were services on the port promenade. Benches had been arranged on the deck, facing a canvas backdrop on which a Red Cross flag was pinned. Father Francis W. Kelly of Philadelphia, a genial smiling fellow with a faculty for plain talk, gave the sermon. It was his second for the day. He had just finished the first shift, which was for Catholics. This one was for Protestants.\n\nIt was pleasant to stand and sing on the rolling deck with the blue panel of the moving sea, on our left, to watch. There we could see two others of our fleet of transports rolling over the long swells, nosing into white surf.\n\nThe sermon dealt with duty, and was obviously pointed toward our coming landing somewhere in Japanese-held territory. Father Kelly, who had been a preacher in a Pennsylvania mining town and had a direct, simple way of speaking which was about right for the crowd of variously uniformed sailors and marines standing before him, pounded home the point.\n\nAfter the services, ironically, many of the men turned to the essential job of loading machine-gun belts. Walking around the deck in the bright morning sun, I had to step around lads sitting on the former shuffleboard court, using a gadget which belted the cartridges automatically. All you had to do was feed them in.\n\nThe lads seemed quite happy at the job. One of them kept time with the clink of the belter. One, two, three, another Jap for me, he said.\n\nOthers tried other ideas. One was reminded of the song Chattanooga Choo Choo, by the sound of the leader. He hummed a few bars of the tune.\n\nAnother boy said, Honorable bullet take honorable Jap honorable death. So solly.\n\nI’ve got a Jap’s name written on each bullet, offered another. There’s three generals among ’em.\n\nWhich one’s for Tojo? asked a buddy, offering to play straight man. Oh, Hell, the first one’s got his name on it, was the answer.\n\nThis conversation, while it did not hit any stratosphere of wit, indicated one thing anyhow: that the lads here at least were relaxed and in high spirits. Probably the facts of full stomachs and clear hot sunlight, with a pleasant breeze, contributed somewhat to the psychology of the situation.\n\nI thought I might as well do a round-up on the morale situation aboard the ship, and so wandered through her splendid innards and turned all the promenades. In the luxurious, modern after lounge, preserved much as it had been in the recent days when the ship was a passenger-freight liner, I found things quiet; one officer was reading an Ellery Queen novel as he sat on a modernistic couch job done in red leather and chrome. A red-headed tank commander sat at one of the skinny black-topped tables where recently cocktails had been served to civilian passengers traveling between North and South America. He was writing an entry in his diary.\n\nThe black-and-cream dance floor, a shiny affair of congoleum, was Vacant.\n\nIn the barroom at one edge of the salon, one of the leather-upholstered booths was filled with officers idly passing the time of day, content and happy, like the men, with full stomachs and pleasant weather.\n\nThe bar itself, a semi-circular slab of light wood, was vacant, with nobody to buy or sell the cigarettes, shaving cream, and porgy bait—naval, marine slang for candy—which sparsely occupied the shelves where once a gleaming array of bottles must have stood.\n\nThere was soft music, coming from the salon’s speaker system. That, and the modern comfort and beauty of the place, brought the thought that this is a pleasant ship on which to travel to war, a sort of streamlined approach to an old adventure, even if there is no liquor behind the bar.\n\nLeaving the pleasant lounge room to go out into the equally pleasant sunshine, I rounded another promenade and found at one corner of it a group of marines, most of them squatting on the deck, gathered around a blackboard.\n\nA sergeant was holding forth as instructor, pointing to one after another of the interesting chalk symbols he had marked on the board. It was a course in map-reading. The sergeant pointed to a chalk representation of a wagon, with a horse-shoe alongside.\n\nWhat would you say it was? he asked one of the men.\n\nIt’s a horse-drawn vehicle, said the marine.\n\nThat’s right, said the sergeant.\n\nI went from there to the forward deck of the ship. Here, it seemed, most of the troops had congregated. They crowded all available standing and sitting space. They were occupied, on this day of rest, principally with shooting the breeze. Some were leisurely turning over a hand of cards or two. A few worked among the complexity of steel cables, derricks and hatches, busy with routine jobs.\n\nI climbed down a narrow ladder into the mouldy semi-darkness, relieved only by bilious yellow lights, of the No. 2 hold. Here I first found myself in a wide room, the center of which was entirely filled with machinery, wooden boxes and canvas duffle bags.\n\nAround the edge of the room were four-level bunks of iron piping, with helmets, packs and other gear dangling in clusters.\n\nBut the place was deserted, except for two or three marines busy sweeping the deck and swabbing the floor of the dank shower room. The rest of the inhabitants were obviously engaged with duties and pleasures in other parts of the ship.\n\nMost of the other holds, similarly, were occupied more by machinery and idle equipment than by people. Much more pleasant on topside. In one hold I found quite a few marines sleeping on their standee bunks, while in the center of the room, two marines in stocking feet chased each other over piles of black ammunition boxes. They were given some encouragement by the few men around the edges who happened to be awake, sitting on boxes or duffle bags.\n\nI went back up on deck, satisfied that this was a peaceful, lazy day of rest almost everywhere on the ship. Everyone seemed relaxed, despite the fact that probably, today or tomorrow, we will know where we are headed, where, possibly, we may die or be wounded on a Japanese beachhead.\n\nBut the pleasing state of relaxation, this Sunday, is understandable. We have been so long wondering where we are to go that we have long since exhausted all possible guesses. One figures one might as well amuse himself while waiting to find out.\n\nIn the lounge again, I spotted Maj. Cornelius P. Van Ness, the graying, earnest planning officer of this group of troops, unfolding a message which had just been given to him by a young naval lieutenant.\n\nSomething to do with our destination? I asked.\n\nHe smiled. No, he said, but I wish it were. I’d like to know too. Even the colonel, said the major, doesn’t yet know where we are headed.\n\nAfter lunch, I had gone back to the stateroom to further digestion with a little bunk duty, and was passing the time of day with two of my roommates, Red Cross Worker Albert Campbell and Father Kelly, when the fourth roommate, Dr. Garrison, rushed in puffing with excitement (Dr. John Garrison, a Los Angeles dentist, was a Navy medical officer).\n\nA lot of ships just came up, he said, plunking his portly bulk onto his bed. A whole navy. Better go look at ’em.\n\nSo we ambled out on deck to see the horizon spotted with ships, in a huge semi-circle around us. There were transports and freight ships, cruisers, destroyers, and the long, high, box-like shapes of aircraft carriers perched on the rim of the ocean.\n\nTalking along the promenade suddenly became louder and more enthusiastic. Officers, sailors, marines were busy counting up totals, trying to identify the different types of ships. Charlie, our slow-speaking, colored room-boy, as usual, had the latest dope. He shuffled up to us and gave us a detailed account of the ships present. Among them he listed the Pepsicola and the Luscious.\n\nIdentification, at that distance, was difficult, but one thing was certain. We had made a rendezvous with the other and main part of our task forces. We were conscious of the fact that this was one of the largest and strongest groups of war vessels ever gathered, certainly the largest and strongest of this war to date. The thought that we were going into our adventure with weight and power behind us was cheering. And our adventure-to-come seemed nearer than ever, as the new group of ships and ours merged and we became one huge force.\n\nThat night, there were movies in the comfortable, swanky, ultramodern ward-room, where officers dined. It was a light thing called Our Wife with Melvyn Douglas and Ruth Hussey. The colonel, amiable, polite John M. Arthur of Union, N.C.—called Doggy because of his fondness for the natty in clothes and grooming—sat next to me. Between reels I suggested to the colonel that it was amazing that his people could relax and enjoy themselves like this, when they were heading for the unpleasant reality of danger, bloodshed, etc. He said, yes, he thought so, too.\n\nMONDAY, JULY 27\n\nThis morning there was much ado in the map-plastered office which the colonel has set up at the edge of the after lounge. A boat had come from one of the other ships, bringing dispatches—and the much-sought secret, it was whispered about, of our destination.\n\nI got a look through the circular glass windows of the doors to the colonel’s office, but there was too much activity to interrupt. The colonel and his staff were bending over the"
