        "text": "Post by dividavi on\n\nOr it was a few days ago, June 14.\n\nRobert Horton, Richard Jaeckel, and Luciana Paluzzi in The Green Slime (1968)\n\nDate of Birth 10 October 1926, Long Beach, Long Island, New York, USA\n\nDate of Death 14 June 1997, Woodland Hills, Los Angeles, California, USA (malignant melanoma)\n\nBirth Name Richard Hanley Jaeckel\n\nNickname Jake\n\nHeight 5' 7\" (1.7 m)\n\nMini Bio (1)\n\nStocky tough-guy character actor Richard Jaeckel remains one of Hollywood's most prolific supporting stars. Born in Long Island, New York, on October 10, 1926, Jaeckel's family moved to Los Angeles when he was still in his teens. After graduation from Hollywood High School, Jaeckel was discovered by a casting director while working as a mailboy for 20th Century-Fox. Although he had some reluctance to act, Jaeckel accepted a key part in the war epic Guadalcanal Diary (1943) and remained in films for over 50 years, graduating from playing baby-faced teenagers (like Dick Clark, Jaeckel never seemed to age) to gunfighters and hired killers with ease. From 1944-48 he served in the US Navy, and after his discharge he co-starred in Sands of Iwo Jima (1949) with John Wayne. Jaeckel's other notable roles in films include one of a trio of GIs accused of raping a German girl in Town Without Pity (1961)--a standout performance--and The Dirty Dozen (1967) as tough MP Sgt. Clyde Bowren, who goes along on the mission to keep an eye on the prisoners he's trained, a role he reprised in a made-for-TV sequel in 1985. Jaeckel also received an Academy Award nomination as Best Supporting Actor for his funny but tragic performance in Sometimes a Great Notion (1970). Although he appeared in over 70 films, he was very active in television series such as Frontier Circus (1961), Banyon (1971), Firehouse (1974), Salvage 1 (1979), At Ease (1983), Spenser: For Hire (1985) and Supercarrier (1988). From 1991-94 he played Lt. Ben Edwards on the hit series Baywatch (1989). He passed away after a three-year battle with melanoma cancer on June 14, 1997, at the Motion Picture and Television Hospital in Woodland Hills, California. Jaeckel was 70 years old.\n\n- IMDb Mini Biography By: Blythe379@cs.com\n\nSpouse (1)\n\nAntoinette Marches (29 May 1947 - 14 June 1997) (his death) (2 children)\n\nFrequently played mean cowboy and military villains\n\nVery often his character did not survive his movie.\n\nTrivia (12)\n\nHis son, Barry, is a former touring PGA golfer.\n\nAlthough Jaeckel was battling cancer, director Joe Dante had originally hoped that he would be able to return to work and provide the voice of Link Static for his project Small Soldiers (1998). This film reunited Jaeckel's fellow cast members from The Dirty Dozen (1967). Jaeckel died from his cancer before shooting began.\n\nHis wife, Antoinette, was diagnosed with Alzheimer's disease shortly before his death.\n\nWas forced to file bankruptcy in early 1994 due to a $1.7-million debt, and eventually he lost his home in Brentwood, CA, and most of his possessions. He later moved into the Motion Picture and Television Retirement Center in Woodland Hills, a retirement home for actors and other motion picture people, where he stayed for the next three years until his death in June of 1997.\n\nAccording to Robert Osborne in \"Academy Awards 1972 Oscar Annual,\" Jaeckel got the role in Sometimes a Great Notion (1970) when Paul Newman ran into him at Malibu Beach. Jaeckel was relaxing and swimming with his family and friends, and as Newman watched him playing with his own children, he thought that Jaeckel would be just right to play his brother in the film. Newman subsequently stood up for casting Jaeckel at later conferences with studio management, and he got the part, and an Oscar nomination.\n\nJaeckel had the distinction of being cast as an \"irregular\" supporting player in films alongside the likes of Paul Newman, Burt Lancaster and Glenn Ford.\n\nHas been in three different projects about outlaw Billy the Kid. In 1954 he played Billy the Kid in an episode of Stories of the Century (1954). In 1970 he appeared in Chisum (1970) as Jess Evans, a former sidekick of Billy the Kid, and then in 1973 he appeared in Pat Garrett & Billy the Kid (1973) as Sheriff Kip McKinney, who assists in capturing the infamous outlaw.\n\nFather of Richard Jaeckel Jr..\n\nIn the early 1970s he and his wife owned a German Shepherd named \"Cruncher\". Cruncher was the name of a character he played on the Mike Connors series Tightrope (1959).\n\nIn November of 1948, while he and his wife were in San Francisco, his oldest son, then 14 months old, fell into the family swimming pool and nearly drowned. His uncle, John Marches, happened to come into the backyard and find the baby.\n\nMet actor Robert Blake while they were filming Town Without Pity (1961) and they became good friends, remaining close until the day Jaeckel died. Blake once said that Jaeckel was the only guy he had ever met who was \"crazier than me\".\n\nHe was a mail courier on the 20th Century-Fox studio lot in 1943 when a casting agent spotted him and signed him for a part in Guadalcanal Diary (1943).\n\nPersonal Quotes (3)\n\n[on being diagnosed with melanoma cancer] I know people are pulling for me to beat this thing, but let them have a glass at the bar for me and let it go at that.\n\nI've put 50 years in movies and my wife and I have traveled all over the world. I've been very lucky.\n\nWe're [he and his wife] not part of the Hollywood social scene. And we don't entertain much. We went through all that early in the going and I found that we just spent a lot of money doing absolutely nothing."
