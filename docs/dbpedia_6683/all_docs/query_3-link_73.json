        "text": "Along with Hollywood's previous picture versions of American fighting on Wake Island and in the Philippines may now be ranked its first conception of the Marine Corps' ordeal on Guadalcanal. \"Guadalcanal Diary\" is the title of this new film which Twentieth Century-Fox has based rather loosely upon the fine record, with that same title, which Richard Tregaskis wrote. It opened yesterday at the Roxy before an audience which was visibly stirred and which, no doubt, had the impression that it was witnessing the Battle of Guadalcanal as it was fought.With the latter impression, we would take issue—just on the basis of Mr. Tregaskis' book. But there is certainly no question that this picture is stirring and inspiring in many ways. For Twentieth Century-Fox has crammed it with heroic action of the grimmest sort. It has not scrupled at showing the dying and the dead in relation to the living fighting on against a stubborn, tricky foe. It has put many incidents into the picture which illuminate a soldier's character. And it has admirably stuck to the business at hand, which was fighting a war, without any pretty digressions along the incidental byways of romance.As a matter of fact, the first part of the film is almost documentarily real—the part showing the shipboard preparations and the landings on Guadalcanal, And it is in this part that the film sticks most closely to the facts set down in Mr. Tregaskis' book. Here we see the marine force approaching the zero hour—the hour of dawn on the memorable morning of Aug. 7, 1942. We see the attack troops lined up in the half-light on their ship's deck, the misty island off to starboard, and the muttered comment through dry lips, \"This is it!\" We catch the electric excitement of the men going into their landing boats, while the naval guns boom a withering barrage and covering planes sweep aloft from carrier decks.The suspense and excitement continue as the men go ashore on Guadalcanal and complete their initial penetration of the abandoned Japanese positions. But, oddly enough, the sense of danger and the nightmare that lay ahead is never realized in this picture as strongly as it is in the first part. One reason is that much footage is devoted to the gags of the marines—the wisecracks and stagey chatter which is familiar from previous films. And another is that the fighting is also comparatively routine, without any true indication of the tension of jungle warfare. And then, too, it seems too fortuitous that the four or five marines we stay with most enjoy a miraculous immunity from death—except for one, just at the end.Indeed, the clear weakness of this picture is that Lamar Trotti and Jerry Cady, who prepared the script, have all too freely rigged up a patent fiction to fit the pattern of a film. Baldly, they have made the implication that air support did not reach Henderson Field until Oct. 14, although the fact is that we had fighters there by mid-August. Also, they have skipped completely the battles of the Tenaru River and \"the Ridge,\" and have saved their heavy fire and fury for the big advance against the enemy on Nov. 10. And the historic episode of Captain Torgeson tossing dynamite into caves on Tulagi has been here attributed to a heroic sergeant and geographically transplanted to Guadalcanal.The performance of the film is generally competent. William Bendix makes a colorful marine—the inevitable Dodger fan from Flatbush—and Lloyd Nolan is the usual tough sergeant. A youngster named Richard Jaeckel is fine as a beardless recruit and Preston Foster is properly humble and heroic as a ministering priest. Lionel Stander has a few comic moments and Anthony Quinn (as an apparent counterpart of Sergeant Few) acts with that grim determination so familiar in actors who \"seek revenge.\"Likewise, the staging is impressive. Much of the picture was made on location at Camp Pendleton, Calif., where tropic beaches and coconut palms abound. Played in settings that look like the real thing and with plenty of humor and action to fill the screen, \"Guadalcanal Diary\" is predestined for top rank among the popular—though not always plausible—war films.\n\nGUADALCANAL DIARY, screen play by Lamar Trotti; adaptation by Jerry Cady; from the book by Richard Tregaskis; directed by Lewis Seiler; produced by Bryan Foy for Twentieth Century-Fox.
