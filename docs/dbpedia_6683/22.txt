Description

Send In The Marines!

Based on the best seller of the same name, Guadalcanal Diary is one of the greatest war movies of all time. This strikingly realistic film follows a devoted platoon of Marines though the terrors of war in the South Pacific.

The all-star cast includes Lloyd Nolan, William Bendix, Preston Foster and Anthony Quinn as soldiers battling disease, treacherous terrain and unrelenting weather, as well as a human enemy. Poignantly narrated, and with explosive action rooted in a solid historical context, Guadalcanal Diary is action-packed entertainment from beginning to end.
