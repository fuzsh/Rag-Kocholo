        "text": "In 1985, Gene Siskel and Roger Ebert hosted At the Movies on local public television affliates across the country. It was THE film resource for cinephiles everywhere. During an episode that season, they heaped praise on Ran from Japanese auteur and filmmaking legend Akira Kurosawa. As a sixteen-year-old growing up in a small Alabama town, I had never seen a film from Japan, but their rave reviews had me asking for it every time I went to my local video store.\n\nThis was the age of VHS. No streaming. No downloading. No internet to order a Blu-ray or DVD. Finally, the call came (on a landline, that is) that Ran was waiting for me to pick up at the video store. The case held two VHS tapes due to its nearly three-hour runtime. It just looked important as I held it in my hands. It was. It changed everything. It introduced me to new worlds of cinema that I continue to explore to this day. Kurosawa was my gateway foreign filmmaker, and I’ve been a Japanese film enthusiast ever since.\n\nI can only imagine what my sixteen-year-old brain would have thought of a twelve-day festival playing the finest cinema Japan has to offer. I would have begged, borrowed and stolen (not really) to immerse myself in such an experience. On July 10th, the 17th annual Japan Cuts — Festival of New Japanese Film opens in New York City and offers just such a cinematic experience for its audiences. The Japan Society curates the festival’s line-up. This year it features three international premieres, fourteen North American premieres and five U.S. premieres.\n\nHere are a few highlights of what the 2024 festival has to offer:\n\nGreat Absence: Takashi (Mirai Moriyama) is an actor who has seen his father, Yohji (Tatsuya Fuji), only a handful of times in the last twenty-five years. As Yohji begins to show signs of dementia, Takashi is summoned to arrange for his father’s care. Yohji’s wife of thirty years has left him, and her whereabouts are unknown as the film begins. Takashi finds himself caring for a man who is a virtual stranger.\n\nWhether the title of the film refers to their lengthy estrangement or the growing vacancy in Yohji’s mind, Great Absence examines the depths of familial ties and obligations in Japanese culture. Information is doled out to the audience via flashbacks and present day conversations. Each scene adds to our understanding of the characters’ pasts with, and without, each other. When the final scene falls into place, the relationships are fully fleshed out, and our questions have been answered.\n\nFor those who’ve cared for aging parents (like me), Great Absence has the ring of truth to its compelling story. The film is equal parts heartbreaking and life-affirming. If you miss the film at the Japan Cuts festival, it opens in theaters across the U.S. on July 19th.\n\nAll the Long Nights: Misa suffers from mood swings and anxiety. It’s been diagnosed as PMS by her doctors, but we can’t help thinking they’ve simply given her a label and sent her on her way. Her co-worker, Takatoshi, suffers from debilitating anxiety. They’ve both found and lost a host of jobs due to their difficulties adapting to their work environments and their co-workers.\n\nThe two meet while working for a small company that makes science kits for school kids. Their employer specializes in “pop-up” planetariums that can be installed in a school gym. It’s a nice thematic touch that two people who can’t cope with change find themselves working in astronomy, a branch of science known for its stability and consistency.\n\nOne of the characters comments on the pop-up planetariums saying, “The entrance is small, but the interior is spacious.” That’s also an apt description of our two protagonists. They are difficult to get to know, but as they interact with one another, the layers of their personalities are slowly peeled back to reveal their complex inner lives.\n\nTo its credit, All the Long Nights is not your typical romance between young people. Nor is it a “rom-com”. There is no “meet cute” moment in the film. Writer-director Sho Miyake wisely avoids the tropes of these genres, giving the film an enjoyable unpredictability. The narrative unfolds slowly, allowing the story time to breathe. We all have an invisible weight we carry in our lives. All the Long Nights is about trying to find the person who makes that burden feel lighter.\n\nBetween the White Key and the Black Key: American films feel an overwhelming need to pick a genre and stick to it: horror, science fiction, crime, etc. Japanese films, on the other hand, have no hesitation about mixing and matching genres to create something unique. I suspect the term “genre mash-up” originated while describing Asian cinema.\n\nBetween the White Key and the Black Key is set in the yakuza underworld of Tokyo in December 1988, but it focuses more on the musicians populating the cabarets and jazz bars than the tough guys who are listening to their music. Think of it as a crime musical. Even the moments of violence are bloodless and cartoonishly pantomimed by the characters. It’s physical comedy and not physical intimidation.\n\nHiroshi is slowly making a name for himself as a pianist when a recently paroled yakuza member makes a simple request: play the theme from The Godfather. Disinclined to say no to a dangerous man, Hiroshi plays the request. The young pianist has no idea that particular song is reserved for Chairman Kumano, the head of the local yakuza family. His mistake sends ripples through the Tokyo underworld and his own world of musicians.\n\nSet largely during a single night, Between the White Key and the Black Key plays like a riff on Martin Scorsese’s 1985 film After Hours. Hiroshi just wants to record a demo tape to apply for a music school in Boston. Instead, he finds himself embroiled in underworld intrigue and competing for status in the Tokyo music scene. Less a gritty crime film and more a whimsical fable, Between the White Key and the Black Key is a perfect selection for Opening Night of the festival when it makes its North American premiere."
