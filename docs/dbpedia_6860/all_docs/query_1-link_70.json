It will be a celebration of ancestors and resilience to end immigrant detention in Washington state and across the country. We will be honoring Charles Leo Daniel who died inside NWDC on March 7th and all we lost to US Concentration Camps and celebrate the resistance of communities in the face of state violence.\n\nJoin our friends La Resistencia and Tsuru for Solidarity to show your solidarity with those inside who are protesting their wrongful imprisonment. Bring the entire family! We will have traditional circle folk dancing from multiple communities, childrenâ€™s art making, a giant daruma, food trucks, multi-faith healing ceremonies, speakers from inside NWDC and an opportunity to wear your yukata or other heritage clothing."
