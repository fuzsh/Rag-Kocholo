        "text": "One of the best treats at the Cannes Film Festival last year was a 4k restoration of Akira Kurosawa‘s classic “Ran.” Now that restoration is hitting the road as part of a national tour mounted by Rialto Pictures, and one that opens at New York City’s Film Forum today, February 26, and runs through March 3. The revival will make stops in Santa Fe, Coral Gables, Pittsburgh and Buffalo throughout March, and distributor StudioCanalUK will be bringing the masterpiece to UK theaters starting April 1.\n\nThe company has issued a new international trailer for the revival and it’s probably going to be the most stunning trailer you see all day.\n\nREAD MORE: After Kurosawa: Why the Japanese Independent Film Industry is Hopeful For the Future\n\nMade in 1985 on a hefty budget of $12 million, “Ran” is Kurosawa’s epic adaptation of Shakespeare’s “King Lear.” The story concerns an aging warlord who wants to divide his kingdom amongst his three sons, though power-hungry jealousy threatens to destroy both the kingdom and the family’s legacy. The director famously staged some of the most impressive battle sequences in film history, using over 1,000 extras and shooting on location at ancient Japanese castles. Rialto and StudioCanal’s restoration brings the movie back to the big screen, which is perhaps the only format suitable to experiencing it."
