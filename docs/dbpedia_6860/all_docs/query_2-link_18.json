        "text": "Parasite, RRR, All Quiet on the Western Front–Thanks to streaming services like Netflix and Hulu, international films are finding an American audience. Many Americans embracing foreign cinema, however, are noticing that movies from other countries look just a little weird or off. Naturally, much of the world has long noticed the same issue with American movies.\n\nThis topic isn’t a new one, either. Even classic cinema from around the world looks different than Old Hollywood. So why has this always been the case?\n\nThe answer, once again, involves Thomas Edison.\n\nSome Glossary Terms before We Get Started\n\nThree different stages define a movie’s look:\n\nProduction: When filmmakers shoot and edit a movie. Lighting, color, and sets affect the composition of a picture. The camera used as well as how fast the camera shoots will also alter the aesthetic of a movie. Finally, the editing process can choose different color profiles and exposure levels before they print a movie.\n\nDistribution: Companies contract with theater owners or video stores to get a film released to the people. Depending on how the movie is released–whether as film or laser projection in a theater, a Blu-ray Disc for home purchase, or a digital file for online streaming–distributors will choose the format. These choices each have only a minuscule effects on a movie’s look, but the total sum may alter how a viewer perceives a film.\n\nExhibition: How a viewer chooses to watch a movie changes that person’s experience. If they see something on an IMAX screen, they may be impressed by a scene that doesn’t have the same impact on a smartphone. A person watching a movie on their cutting-edge television, meanwhile, may enjoy a film more had they gone to a rundown cineplex whose projectors make everything overly orange.\n\nHertz – How many times per second a wavelength changes (specifically electron polarity in this article)\n\nFrames per Second – How many pictures are taken of a subject in a movie camera. These pictures, run back, fool the human eye into believing the pictures are moving–hence the term “motion pictures.”\n\nOld Hollywood – The period of time in American movie history that covers the studio system, when movie companies could totally control every aspect of production, distribution, and exhibition. This began in the late 1910s, was wounded upon a Supreme Court decision in 1948, and ultimately died in 1969.\n\nTesla: Current, though Not Recently\n\nIn the late 1800s, Nikola Tesla and Westinghouse’s alternating current (AC) beat Thomas Edison and General Electric’s direct current (DC). As such, light bulbs were marked with a 60-hertz rating (60Hz). This means that 60 times a second, electrons in the light-bulb circuit reverse polarity. Our human eyes don’t care because we can’t process anything faster than .013 seconds, so we see the lightbulb as producing light continuously.\n\nGeneral Electric, adopting alternating current, began manufacturing for Europe, a continent entirely devoted to the metric system. Therefore, GE standardized Europe’s lightbulbs to 50 hertz (50Hz), a number that easily matched Europeans’ measurements. The rest of the metric-using world followed because, again, the human eye couldn’t tell.\n\nMotion Pictures’ Pacing Problem\n\nYou know what CAN catch that polarity switch? A movie camera, which Hollywood standardized to 24 frames per second (24fps). Studios chose this number because it has numerous divisible factors. Editors could cut together clips of various frame length and still come out even. This worked in America because multiples of 24 rarely line up with multiples of 60.\n\nThis didn’t work for metric countries, however, because 24 WAS close enough time-wise to 50Hz. This resulted in cameras catching part of that lightbulb polarity shift over and over again. Played back for an audience, all lights in a shot look like they’re flickering! Thus, metric-standard countries adopted a film speed of 30fps. Those extra frames gave non-American films a look that was a tad bit more real and harsh, sacrificing the dreamlike, cinematic quality for which Old Hollywood is known. While this tradeoff may initially sound like a detriment, aesthetic became one of the many reasons Old Hollywood died.\n\nThe Studio System: Set Up to Fail\n\nThe ironclad empire that major studios set up in Hollywood from the 1910s through the mid 1960s was a factory whose product had profound cultural impact the world over. This look became synonymous with classic cinema–achieved by studio-owned sets, lights, and cameras. Rarely did movies film on actual locations; rather, they filmed on studio lots with sets built to be easily manipulated for camera and light movement. In the early-to-mid-20th century, there was nowhere else on Earth where filmmakers could achieve this gold-standard look…\n\n…which is one of the reasons Old Hollywood eventually died. Because censorship prevented cinema from addressing shifting cultural concerns, audiences began rejecting American cinema all together. International cinema told stories to which average moviegoers could relate. These films favored physically real locations and shunned the artifice that studio movies favored. The different frame rate came into play as well, adding more realism to international movies than Hollywood offered.\n\nIn the late ’60s, Hollywood began adapting both in content and in look, and, by the late ’70s, foreign films once again played second fiddle to Hollywood in the America’s zeitgeist. Home video, though, would make Hertz rate important once again.\n\nThe Soap Opera Effect! Dun, dun, DUN!\n\nHome video skyrocketed in 1978, with 20th Century Fox movies like Star Wars and Alien reaping early benefits. Those who have seen VHS tapes are likely familiar with the information card before a movie, which read, “The following film has been modified from its original version. It has been formatted to fit this screen.” Usually, this meant the rectangular image projected on a theater screen got uncerimoniously chopped into a square so that it’d fit TVs of the day. It also meant, however, that the frame rate was reprosseced to match that TV’s standards.\n\nIn a bizarre flip, American TVs output at a rate of 60Hz, so home video had to run at a speed similar to the original international standard of 30fps. The rest of the world’s television sets ran at 50Hz, so their home video now ran using a system that mimicked Old Hollywood’s 25fps! As such, an American VCR couldn’t play a European VHS tape and vice versa. When reformatting, to equalize the frame rate, distributors just duplicated every fifth frame.\n\nThe result was paradoxically hyperreal and plastic, like watching a soap opera. Foreign films looked dreadful during this time–Roger Moore looked waxy in James Bond movies while Hercule Poirot reruns on PBS looked both too fuzzy and too smooth. This motion smoothing became known as “The Soap Opera Effect,” because it imitated daytime television’s dim lighting, cheap sets, and rushed camera shots.\n\nSuch was foreign films’ lot until DVDs became popular.\n\nDVD–versatile…unless it’s region locked\n\nDVD and Blu-ray players are set to only play discs matching a numbered region:\n\n0 – Region Free\n\n1 – Canada, United States, and Bermuda\n\n2 – Japan, Europe, South Africa, Egypt, and The Middle East\n\n3 – Southeast Asia and East Asia (including Hong Kong)\n\n4 – Australia, New Zealand, Pacific Islands, Central and South America, and the Caribbean\n\n5 – Africa, Russia, and India\n\n6 – Mainland China\n\n7 – Pre-release screeners\n\n8 – Aircraft and Cruise Ships\n\nThese codes ensure that a movie can do a proper exhibition rollout by region. For instance, as of this writing (12/11/23), Hayao Miyazaki’s The Boy and the Heron has already finished its theatrical run in Japan yet only opened in American theaters last Friday. The movie’s American distributor delayed the release because they acquired a truly stellar voice cast, including Christian Bale and Robert Pattinson. Were region-one DVDs of the movie available at the same time as Japan’s region two, it could undercut the movie’s box-office sales.\n\nThese region codes also ensure that releases are properly formatted to their consumers’ TV modes. Regardless of how sophisticated a television set is, it still runs on alternating current of 50Hz or 60Hz. Once films became remastered for DVDs and Blu-Ray, these codes effectively killed The Soap Opera Effect.\n\nOf course, free-speech advocates rightly criticize region-locked DVDs because governments can easily censor what their citizens can consume (see region six…). The advent of high-speed internet has somewhat skirted that issue, and leaps forward in digital technology have forced the world to change filming and screening techniques yet again!\n\nRED with Envy\n\nAs high-definition TVs caught on with mainstream consumers, filmmakers had to use new technology to keep up because traditional film had become too expensive. Cameras needed digital-friendly videotape. Moreover, TV and movies filmed in digital needed a digital editing system as opposed to traditional film cutting or enormous video decks. The solution was desktop video, played from a miniature videocassette (Mini DV). This was TV production’s solution from the late ’90s to about 2010. The reason was because HD visuals took an enormous amount of storage, with uncompressed HD images needing a streaming rate of one gigabit per second!\n\nThe late 2000s saw the introduction of file storage rather than tape because raw files could be stored into hard drives or camera cards. A new generation of digital cameras, namely the RED One and ARRI Alexa, became capable of capturing 4K–digital sharpness on par with 35mm film. Once studios adopted these cameras, traditional film became increasingly obsolete.\n\nFinally, starting in 2012, Netflix began releasing original programming THE WORLD OVER. If a movie or show wanted a launch on Netflix, the program had to have a certain level of quality. This, in turn, hastened the standardization of file workflows and UHD cameras. Finally, movies and TV the world over drastically reduced their differences in exhibition look.\n\nSo, Wait, Why Do Foreign Movies STILL Look Different?\n\nBecause, for all our technical advancements over the last century, cameras still need electricity to run. That’s right–we’re still beholden to 50Hz/60Hz. This difference may not matter for much longer, though, as the world adapts to newer LED lightbulbs. Since LED lights offer continuous light, without the 50 or 60Hz flicker issue, future cameras may do away with the difference entirely.\n\nAnother issue is the cost of equipment used. A new ARRI Alexa camera–the model which Hollywood favors for nearly all of their movies–costs more than a Corvette. Cameras brands such as BlackMagic boast many of the same features for $10,000 or less. BlackMagic produces an excellent image–80% as good as RED or ARRI. When that image is captured, then exhibited to viewers, though, the human eye notices a subtle difference, pinging the brain. Contrast not as vivid? Motion in a shot a touch less smooth? The brain notices.\n\nFinally, production choices play a factor in look as well. A filmmaker from the U.S. and a filmmaker from France will have learned different lighting styles and techniques, will film in different locations that have different visual aesthetics, and rely on heads of departments who also came from different schools. The beauty of these inescapable minutiae is that, even as media conglomerates standardize content as they take over markets in every country of the world, every piece of content will still bear the mark of the people who made it."
