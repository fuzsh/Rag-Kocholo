        "text": "T eachers often use film to help them present complex subjects in their high school classes. Unfortunately, many films designed for classroom use are not as interesting as commercial productions-and many commercial films are not appropriate for the classroom! A good film is one that students will watch. It must look and sound better than a monotone rendering of a textbook. To engage a Language Arts class, the vehicle itself-the film-must be noteworthy. In English Literature, one of the great classics is, of course, Shakespeare's King Lear. Most teachers show all or part of various film versions of the play, but students say they don't work very well. They feel the acting is stiff and the language difficult, dense, and strangely unfamiliar. But don't give up! There is a film that students will embrace-Akira Kurosawa's Ran-a Japanese telling of the Lear story and one of the best catalysts for the study of English and Asian culture in an interdisciplinary format. Akira Kurosawa (1910-98), one of Japan's finest artists, produced an astonishing number of films including Seven Samurai, RashÂ¬mon, The Hidden Fortress, and Throne of Blood, his stunning, highly acclaimed adaptation of Shakespeare's Macbeth. He was known for his use of rich visual imagery borrowed from Japanese theater, painting, music, and dance. Ran is lengthy and presented in Japanese with English subtitles, but American students love it. Those who complain that Shakespeare is too tough often find the Japanese version intriguing and easier to watch. The grand sweeps of scenic beauty and reliance on action, a universal language, underscore the plot line and its themes. Both King Lear and Ran deal with pride, selfishness, and conceit as causes of community suffering (war and discord) and the ultimate personal descent into madness. One man's ego leads to profound unhappiness for many. Somehow students see this more clearly in the Japanese film than in Shakespeare's words. Ran creates a \"teachable moment.\" It opens ways for Western students to learn about Asian culture while studying a Shakespearean classic-a perfect combination of outcomes. The task for instructors is to organize a plan that achieves them. King Lear and Ran are too big to read or see all at once in the classroom. Teachers must break them into manageable pieces. Assign students to read the first scene in King Lear and watch the first twenty-two minutes of Ran. This is enough to get them into the study of the story and the cultures that produced the two versions. In Shakespeare's story the opening scene is fast-paced; characters banter with one another, punning significantly and foreshadowing events to come. The allusions are sneaky, and the audience has to be alert to catch them. Typical of Elizabethan drama, dialogue is overlaid with metaphor and simile, florid poetic phrasing, and a touch of slapstick. Young audiences have to be prepped for the lively dialogue, obscure references, and important allegory. It works best on stage, it seems, and this may be the reason students don't appreciate King Lear on film. Ran is different. The film is strikingly visual, and students note this fact right away. The visual element catches their attention and rivets them to the story. Ran opens with a glorious action-packed hunting scene. Colorfully dressed warriors ride across fields on powerful horses before infinitely vast landscapes, beneath endless skies. The metaphors are there, but they are subtle-even in the midst of all the action, the allusions are subtle. American students love it. Ran is the film to use and this short introduction is enough to get students excited about further study. Instructors have to find ways to keep the class engaged in the texts. Teachers should vary classroom activities, of course, because there is no single best way to teach or learn, and we obviously want all students to be involved in the study. It is important to do more with literature than just read it. Some"
