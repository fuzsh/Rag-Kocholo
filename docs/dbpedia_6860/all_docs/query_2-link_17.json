        "text": "The director & writer gave us the backstories like puzzles with pieces all over the movie and it's upto us to piece them together and this is how I put them together.\n\nI wrote this in parts so u can jump to the part u want to read.\n\nJin Soo & Cheong Seok\n\nLet's start with Jin Soo and Cheong Seok's storyline first. Cheong tells Jinsoo that he seems familiar for some reason, that's because Cheong saw him at his mother's funeral. Cheong's Mother killed Jinsoo's wife and child in a drunk drive accident. But she got lenient sentence in the court which enraged Jinsoo causing trouble in the court and hence his record of disturbance which cop finds during his background check. Cheong's Mother couldn't get through the guilt and commits suicide. She apolozises to Jinsoo and asks him to take care of Cheong. Thus Jinsoo meets Cheong at the funeral. Jinsoo takes Cheong to temple and becomes a Monk where he meets his fate as guard of Sarira Casket and his duty to ascend the souls. Even though he became a Monk he couldn't get over his hate and wanted to kill Cheong as payback for his mother's sin but couldn't do it, so he leaves the temple ( this is mentioned by the monster at the end). He becomes a construction worker but the souls still follow him asking him to ascend them. After the final stepping stone The monster needs to possess him cuz he is the guard who can open the Sarira Casket.\n\nThe Monster\n\nAccording to ancient scriptures in India, the difference between animals and humans is the intelligence. But unfortunately humans suffer because of their own intelligence. Our intelligence has two parts Memory and Imagination. Although they are a blessing, some times we suffer because of them. We suffer because of something happened in the past(memory) & we suffer because of what may happen in the future (imagination). even though it's not happening in the present, we suffer because of Past and Future.That's why Buddha said the the key is to let go. The two eyes of the monster represents these two sufferings. The red eye needs to go through 7 stepping stones to reach the black eye.\n\n7 stepping stones\n\nThe primary characteristics of 7 stepping stones is that they tried to kill themselves but failed. The 7th stepping stone is virgin shaman and she is different from others. While other stepping stones are regular people who are oblivious and sitting ducks, she is a shaman who can sense things. So why would she sit put when a monster is coming for her? Obviously she would know ways to hide and protect herself. Remember the talisman she gave to the cop protected him temporarily. Although she can't evade the monster forever, she can evade him temporarily and that's all she needs to do as the monster has only limited amount of time(8days). That's where the Red maid comes in.\n\nAe Ran / Red Maid\n\nRed maid means maid of the red eye, hence she is chained to the red eye. Red on her white clothes is symbolic. Her duty is to assist the monster.\n\nAt end of movie , Cheong was able to free AeRan from her chains because he now became the successor of Jinsoo as the guard of the Sarira casket. Now with AeRan by his side, the next potential Bring it on Ghost story starts...."
