        "text": "The Oscars are this weekend, ready to wrap up awards season and consign the films of 2023 to the history books. Cinema in 2023 was much improved over 2022, and there were good movies to suit just about any interest.\n\nI don’t want to talk about those, though. I want to talk about the forgotten movies. These are the movies that tried. The movies that often came up short. I’ve seen 44 of 2023’s films, and here are the best of the rest.\n\nWeirdest Thing That Tried To Be Normal\n\n“Rally Road Racers.” Normality is something most movies try to surpass, but for a select few, it instead represents an unattainable dream. “Rally Road Racers” is an animated kids’ film about talking animals who do nothing but bicker with each other and drive cars that make no engineering sense.\n\nFunded by six production companies spread out across multiple continents, “Rally Road Racers” has all the not-quiteright narrative touches of a film produced for a foreign market and then inexpertly dubbed into English. The surprise is that English really is the original language.\n\nThis makes John Cleese’s performance as the villain, an Australian cane toad, the canonical one. He raps at one point, and while it’s become a cliche in modern movies to have cartoon characters do that, his performance is special in ways I can’t quite articulate and may never be able to forget.\n\nRunner up: “Plane.” This is an action adventure film that unfolds like a tabletop role-playing game session. Specifically one where the players are determined to defeat the scenario by whatever illogical means occur to them.\n\nGerard Butler is the lead, and he punches and harrumphs his way through it with phlegmatic stoicism. I’m not sure he’s enjoying this stage of his career, but I’m enjoying it a lot. I hope that knowledge would please him if he ever found out.\n\nFilm Most Likely To Be Forgotten First\n\n“Freelance.” I saw a lot of middling movies this year (and a handful of stinkers) that history has every reason to forget. “Freelance” is the most average of them—more engaging than “We Have a Ghost” and “Quasi,” but without the personality of “Plane” and “Dark Harvest.”\n\nThe story of what happens when John Cena is dropped into the jungle and forced to be funny with no help, it lacks even memorable mistakes. Cena acquits himself decently in the action sequences, and Juan Pablo Raba is a fun foil as the lackadaisical head of a fictional Latin American nation, but the good parts only cancel out enough of the bad for a zero-sum total.\n\nRunner-up: “Haunted Mansion,” Disney’s accidental case study in how to make a horror-comedy that is neither scary nor funny, and how to waste talent and money doing it.\n\nBest Movie That Wasn’t Good\n\n“The Creator.” This is one of a few films on my viewing list that actually did get nominated at the Oscars, but the only one to which I would give one of my fake awards. It’s up for two technical categories, Best Sound and Best Visual Effects, and could plausibly win either one.\n\nWhere it under-performs is the story. This parable of humanity’s relationship with AI throws itself softball questions and whiffs half of them, yet it has the most thoroughly realized sci-fi world I’ve seen in years. It also features a commanding performance by Allison Janney as a hardnosed military bad guy who’s far more memorable than the protagonists.\n\nPaired with a more challenging narrative, that craftsmanship could have been the heart of a new “Star Wars.” Instead, it’s the new “Logan’s Run:” An excellent showcase of what special effects were capable of in its time and place, and what the people wielding them were afraid of.\n\nRunner-up: “Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse.” Everyone but me loved this film. I found it less funny or emotional than its predecessor, “Into the Spider-Verse,” and also driving dangerously close to the merge lane with all the other Spider-Man movies. It’s the second part in a trilogy, though, and it’s possible the final entry will tie everything back together.\n\nBest Movie That Shouldn’t Have Been Good\n\n“65.” This sci-fi/action hybrid, set in the days immediately before the asteroid kills the dinosaurs, is a mess. The dinosaur designs are all wrong and the basic concept is little more than an obstacle course for the hero and his ward. “65” should be tedious and underwhelming.\n\nYet it pulls itself together, thanks in no small part to Adam Driver as the hapless alien man who must reach his ship’s escape pod. Driver is crabby and frustrated with the little girl he has to protect, to the point that the story feels almost like a road trip with the Sword of Damocles hanging off the rear-view mirror.\n\nMovies rarely illustrate their tension as literally as the asteroid that sits in the sky for much of the film, and that literalism is part of the charm. “65” underperformed at the box office but was a Netflix hit later on, and it’s easy to see why. Just because people didn’t want to buy tickets for something doesn’t mean it’s not a good time.\n\nRunner-up: “Five Nights at Freddy’s.” This horror comedy, adapted from the video game series of the same name, breaks zero new ground and has a grand time doing it. Josh Hutcherson plays straight man to a menagerie of creaking, haunted animatronics built by Jim Henson’s Creature Shop. If that sounds like fun to you, it probably will be.\n\nBest Unnecessary Sequel\n\n“Evil Dead Rise.” The goofy, kinetic blend of horror and violence that defines the “Evil Dead” series proved strong enough to stand on its own. Only loosely connected to the prior films (and TV show), this is a smart movie that makes excellent use of its confined space and small cast.\n\nBy revisiting old themes with new characters, the audience is forearmed with dread, left to wonder who will piece together the puzzle fast enough to make it out alive. This is a good formula for keeping a franchise alive, if that’s really something you have to do.\n\nRunner-up: “Mission: Impossible— Dead Reckoning Part One.” At some point Tom Cruise is going to be too old to keep jumping out of stuff, but that day hasn’t come yet. This storyline was supposed to be his character’s swan-song, but Cruise kicked that can a little farther down the road. We’ll see whether he can stage a graceful exit later on.\n\nBest Thing No One Saw\n\n“Polite Society.” I hereby award this most honorable of honorable mentions to the movie that tried to be everything at once. Illuminated by the feverish imagination of Ria Khan (Priya Kansara), aspiring teenage stuntwoman, this is a genre-mulching mix of action, comedy, horror, drama, and musical.\n\n“Polite Society” is a study in mismatch—the gap between Ria and her older sister Lena, the gap between personal dreams and social expectations, and the gap between how cool you think you’d look in a fight versus how well that actually goes.\n\nIt is bitingly funny and yet still thrillingly sincere, and these two traits do much to forgive the uneven edges where its genre influences collage together. Kansara and director Nida Manzoor are names to watch in the future.\n\nRunners-up: There are a lot to choose from. “It Lives Inside” is an excellent study in how to pull off a horror movie with drastically limited resources. “Dungeons & Dragons: Honor Among Thieves,” which got good reviews but underperformed at the box office, did the Marvel rag-tag band of heroes thing better than Marvel itself has in years. “Reality,” which mostly follows three people in one room for a little over an hour in real-time, is narrative storytelling reduced down to the absolute minimum number of parts.\n\nThere were, overall, a lot of good movies to choose from in 2023. The world remains a turbulent place, but for the moment, at least, Hollywood is back in gear."
