        "text": "‘What kind of world do we live in?’\n\nAkira Kurosawa’s late-career classic is the haunting vision of a world characterised by human greed and betrayal. Meticulously planned over several years, Ran’s striking visual style and grand scale are defining features of an exceptional cinematic achievement.\n\nSet in 16th century Japan, Ran tells the story of ageing warlord Hidetora Ichimonji and the transfer of power to his three sons: Taro, Jiro and Saburo. Almost immediately, trust between father and sons is broken, as jealousy and ambition, spurred on by Taro’s wife, Lady Kaede, surpass any sense of family loyalty. Resentment soon turns to bloodshed, and results in the tragic torment and demise of the Ichimonji clan.\n\nRan was the creation of master filmmaker Akira Kurosawa, at a time when many thought the director’s best days were behind him. Kurosawa had risen to international prominence in the 1950s with the release of such classics as ‘Rashomon’ (1950) and ‘Seven Samurai’ (1954), and he was hailed as one of cinema’s greatest talents. However, the late 1960s and 1970s proved to be an incredibly difficult time for Kurosawa, both personally and professionally, and he struggled to realise new projects.\n\nThe idea for Ran stemmed from the legend of medieval warlord Mori Motonari and his three loyal sons. Kurosawa envisioned an alternative history in which his sons had turned on their father, and was heavily inspired by Shakespeare’s ‘King Lear’ in shaping the story. Kurosawa conceived the script and painted elaborate storyboards in the 1970s, while also pursuing the elusive funding needed for the project; it was only after the international success of ‘Kagemusha’ (1980), with the support of American directors Francis Coppola and George Lucas, that he was able to secure funding for what became the most expensive Japanese film of the time.\n\nRan roughly translates as the word ‘chaos,’ and the chaotic events to follow are set in motion during the tense gathering of the opening scenes. By handing over control of the clan to his three sons in an apparent act of unity and peace, Hidetora unwittingly exposes the mistrust and ruthless desire simmering below the surface of those closest to him. The film questions the nature of loyalty, and whether it really exists, even within families, in a world dominated by war and personal ambition. Tragically, events conspire to ensure that neither father nor sons will survive the turmoil that ensues, and a vicious circle of futile deaths is completed by the cruellest twist of fate.\n\nHidetora is a complicated character who can be viewed as both victim and villain. On one hand, he is an old man beginning to reassess his past, whose innocent decision spectacularly backfires to leave him alone and abandoned by his family. On the other hand, the ageing warlord has lived his life on the battlefield, and has gained everything he owns through inflicting violence and suffering upon others; his sons have been raised this way, and Hidetora is responsible for nurturing their lust for power.\n\nOne of the key elements of Hidetora’s downfall is his stubborn pride and refusal to admit when he is wrong. After his decision to relinquish power, Hidetora finds it hard to let go, and even after he is betrayed by Taro and Jiro, he is unwilling to accept that his one loyal son, Saburo, was correct in his honest initial assessment. This realisation becomes the tipping point for Hidetora, and he begins to lose his mind; he is destined to roam the plains for the rest of the film, suffering with visions of those he has killed in the past.\n\nLady Kaede’s actions drive much of the plot, and she is frightening in her quest for vengeance at all costs. Her family were killed by Hidetora, and her personal interest in the destruction of the clan is made clear, as she forces Taro and blackmails Jiro into acts of violence that she knows will lead to the end of their family. Neither son stands up to Lady Kaede’s antagonising and scheming barbs; only the loyal Kurogane is bold enough to speak up and ultimately take her life in the film’s most brutal scene.\n\nIn common with many of Kurosawa’s films, Ran is an expressive and theatrical experience in which the characters’ actions are exaggerated; most notably, Hidetora’s journey to madness is emphasised by his stylised appearance and make-up, which are significantly influenced by traditional Noh Theatre. There is a strong sense that Kurosawa used Ran as a triumphant culmination and grand final statement of his career, taking inspiration from many of his previous period films, including his first foray into Shakespeare, ‘Throne of Blood’ (1957).\n\nEven compared to the Shakespeare tragedy from which the story derives, Ran is an unwaveringly bleak work without any hint of optimism. Whether guilty or innocent, most of the characters die, and the director clearly intended to express despair at humanity’s failure to learn from history by continually inflicting misery and bloodshed on one another. Kurosawa, then in his mid-70s, identified with the character of Hidetora, and Ran is certainly the work of a man towards the end of his life, questioning his position in the world.\n\nIn contrast to some of Kurosawa’s earlier films, Ran takes its time to develop; there is a great sense of control that allows the story to progress visually, and every image is savoured in a way that is reminiscent of Stanley Kubrick’s best films. Kurosawa’s obsessive attention to detail is emphasised by the precise camera angles and immaculate framing of scenes, and he was ably assisted in the visual style of the film by his three cinematographers, Takao Saito, Masaharu Ueda and Asakazu Nakai.\n\nRan is deservedly remembered for some of the most impressive images committed to film. Kurosawa used bold, rich colours throughout, and from the opening scenes, the primary colours of the three sons are contrasted with the lush green grass of the plains to stunning effect. The beautiful, intricate clothing of every character is an outstanding feature that significantly enhances the distinctive palette of the film; designer Emi Wada worked tirelessly on the creation of costumes and received widespread acclaim for her contribution.\n\nThe ‘silent’ battle provides Ran with its most evocative images, and leaves an indelible mark for the rest of the film. The incredible battle choreography, complete with shooting arrows and the total carnage of hundreds of extras, is unique in its depiction of cold-blooded warfare. The scene provides arguably the finest image of the film, as Hidetora emerges from the burning castle like a ghost, and descends the steps through the bemused armies of men who have survived the bloodshed. The tense ‘chess game’ leading up to the second battle is equally well choreographed, as violence inevitably breaks out and the sound of thundering hooves, gunshots and falling bodies accompany the remarkable images on screen.\n\nToru Takemitsu composed the sombre music of Ran, which is a crucial component of the film’s atmospheric drama. The dissonant flute sounds of the opening and closing scenes are strongly influenced by Noh Theatre, and provide an eerie soundtrack to the disjointed nature of the world depicted on screen. The most impressive piece of music is heard during the famous first battle, as the composer’s majestic score accompanies the mindless destruction; the swirling strings amplify the tragedy to grand proportions, and provide the scene with an incredible emotional power.\n\nThe cast of the film displayed total commitment to their roles, none more so than Tatsuya Nakadai as Hidetora Ichimonji. A long-time Kurosawa collaborator, Nakadai’s performance is an incredibly physical and sometimes darkly funny portrayal of a man who loses everything. Hidetora’s sidekick and fool, Kyoami, played by Shinnosuke Ikehata, provides the film with several comic moments, including the bickering love-hate relationship he has with Hidetora. The rest of the cast all provided fine portrayals of predominantly flawed characters, none as surprising or commanding as Mieko Harada as the maniacal Lady Kaede.\n\nUpon release, Ran was highly acclaimed internationally, but proved to be only a modest commercial success that was largely overlooked at the main awards events. Kurosawa had long been held in higher regard abroad than in his home country, and tellingly decided to make appearances at such international events as the American Academy Awards, but not the newly formed Tokyo Film Festival. It was only in time, and after Kurosawa’s death, that Ran’s reputation grew stronger, and it was eventually hailed as one of the filmmaker’s greatest achievements.\n\nToday, Ran is remembered as an astonishing epic, and a high point in the work of one of the finest directors. While it was not Kurosawa’s last film, it’s clear that he intended it as such, and at a time shortly before CGI, Ran was a breathtaking display of filmmaking on a very real and human scale. Perhaps above all, the film is a brutally honest statement on the human tendency for chaos and destruction. The main characters in Ran end up either dead or in misery, while the rest of humanity, as represented by the blind man, Tsurumaru, are lost and alone on a cliff edge, without the solace of Buddha, in one of the most ominously symbolic final scenes ever filmed."
