        "text": "Our Top 10 Brenda Russell Songs list will look at a legendary singer, songwriter, musician and producer. The talented singer has composed many classic songs including “Piano in the Dark,” “Get Here” and “If Only For One Night.” She has a talent to shift between musical genres when it comes to her writing. Her music has been sampled by many artists. Some of the artists who have worked with her, covered her songs or sampled her songs are Luther Vandross, Babyface, Michael McDonald, Janet Jackson, Mary J. Blige, Bow Wow, Donna Summer, Earth, Wind & Fire, Ray Charles, Joe Cocker, Roberta Flack, Al Jarreau and Johnny Mathis. Brenda Russell has been nominated for Grammy and Tony Awards. She has won one Grammy Award.\n\nBrenda Russell was born Brenda Gordon on April 8, 1949. She has music in her blood. Her father was a member of the Ink Spots. Her mother was a singer and songwriter. Brenda Russell was destined to be in the music industry. Like most artists, she was in a band called The Tiaras. In 1968 they released a single called “Where Did All the Time Go.” The single was unsuccessful. Brenda Russell had a natural talent to play the piano. She learned how to play when she was a teenager.\n\nIn the 70s, she and her manager were sending her demos to producers. She was signed to Horizon Records. She married a musician named Brian Russell. They were in the band Dr. Music. They produced the single “Please Pardon Me” by Rufus. She and her husband provided background vocals on Neil Sedaka’s hit “Laughter in the Rain.” They were background vocalists for one of Elton John’s concerts. The Russells released two albums together called Word Called Love (1976) and Supersonic Lover (1977). They worked with Robert Palmer on his album Double Fun. When the Russells got divorced, she decided to pursue a solo career.\n\nBrenda Russell released her self-tilted album in July 1979. It peaked at number 26 on the r&b charts and 65 on Billboard 200.
