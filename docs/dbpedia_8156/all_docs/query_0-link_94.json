We had so many independent record stores, Musicians and DJ's everywhere and to top it off we had some really creative Radio Stations. One of the ground breaking stations that we had in the late 70's and early 80's was the amazing WJZZ. Yea, \"JZZ\" played a new type of progressive Jazz and it was where I first heard a song called: \"Tiger in The Rain.\" I thought that tune was the smoothest song I had ever heard. I later found out the singer was Michael Franks, I became a fan immediately. I was collecting mostly dance records in the early 1980's but from that point on I had to throw in a \"Franks album\" or two. By the time his album Skin Dive came out (1985) my friends and I all considered ourselves Michael Franks' aficionado's (LOL). It was on this album where Franks collaborated with the super talented Ms. Brenda Russell on \"When I Give My Love to You\" and as they say, The rest was musical history... Hope you guys enjoy my early evening \"Rooftop\" Vibe!!! As Always Thanks so much for Tuning In!
