        "text": "from WORLD CALLED LOVE\n\nWritten by David Foster & Brenda Russell\n\nShe was born Brenda Gordon on April 8, 1949 (the year varies) in Brooklyn, New York to father Gus Gordon, one of the Ink Spots and a member of the Bill Johnson Quartet, and mother Cinnamon Sharpe, who sang and wrote songs. She would become known as Brenda Russell, a distinguished singer/songwriter of gems including “Get Here” and “If Only For One Night.” Ms. Russell was active in the early seventies with her first husband Brian Russell as backing vocalists for artists including Anne Murray, Cat Stevens, Sir Elton John, Neil Sedaka and Cher . Sir Elton, recognizing the duo’s talent, signed them to his Rocket Record Company and 1976 brought their debut album titled World Called Love.\n\nFrom WORLD CALLED LOVE\n\nWritten by David Foster, Brenda Russell & Brian Russell\n\n“Gonna Do My Best To Love You” was one of David Foster’s first, important credits as a songwriter way back in the early seventies.\n\nFrom TWO EYES\n\nWritten by David Foster & Brenda Russell\n\nWe just mentioned a few weeks ago the great results of every Foster collaboration with fellow producer Tommy LiPuma and here they are again, this time Foster appearing on Brenda Russell’s 1983 album, “Two Eyes”, that Lipuma produced.\n\nFrom FACES\n\nWritten by David Foster, Maurice White, Verdine White, Larry Dunn, Brenda Russell\n\n“There aren’t enough words to express how I feel about you, your contribution to musical history and your contribution to my personal growth. You are my mentor. Much of what I’ve learned has come from listening, not only to your music, but dissecting the magic way in which you create it”."
