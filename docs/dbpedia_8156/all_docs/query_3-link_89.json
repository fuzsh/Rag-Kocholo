        "text": "— The joint venture between Sony/ATV Music Publishing and Stellar Songs has signed a worldwide deal with songwriter, artist and producer Diztortion for future compositions.\n\nIn the past, Diztortion has worked with such acts as Tinie Tempah, Lethal Bizzle, DJ Fresh and Major Lazer, as well as establishing his own career as a recording artist. Diztortion is currently working with the likes of Craig David, Taya and Lotto Boyz, among others.\n\n“We are all thrilled that Diz, along with his team, have trusted Stellar Songs and Sony/ATV with the next phase of their career,” Sony/ATV senior A&R manager Alastair Kinross said in a statement. “We’re all long-time fans and are really excited about what we can build together going forward.”\n\nThrough his writing and production collaborations with other artists, he has worked on such songs as “Soundbwoy,” “Badd,” “My Number One,” “The Drop,” “Rari WorkOut,” “Fester Skank” and “Peak.”\n\nTrending on Billboard\n\n“Tim [Blacksmith] and I are over the moon to welcome Diztortion into the Stellar Songs/Sony/ATV family,” Stellar co-founder Danny D said in a statement. “We have wanted to work with him from the day we first heard ‘Fester Skank’ and everyone is excited to be a part of his exciting future as an artist, songwriter and producer.”\n\nUnder his own name, Diztortion has recorded singles with such artists as Beenie Man, Ms. Dynamite and Sigma.\n\n“I am super-hyped about joining the Stellar Songs and Sony/ATV family,” Diztortion said in a statement. “I’ve been a massive admirer of the incredible roster they have and the way exciting new talent is nurtured and given opportunities with established writers. This is an important next phase of my career and to have the backing of legends like Danny D and Tim Blacksmith alongside the brilliant Sony/ATV team of Alastair Kinross, [UK head of A&R] David Ventura and [president of worldwide creative] Guy Moot is really a huge blessing.”\n\n— Primary Wave Music Publishing acquired the catalog of Brenda Russell, which includes her hits “Get Here” and “Piano In The Dark.” Terms of the deal were not disclosed.\n\n“Brenda Russell is a legendary songwriter whose songs have gone on to win and be nominated for a variety of awards throughout her over 30 years in the industry,” Primary Wave Music Publishing founder/CEO Larry Mestel said in a statement. “I am thrilled that we had the opportunity to bring her into the Primary Wave family and am excited for what lies ahead.”\n\nThe deal also includes “If Only For One Night,” a song from her first album that was later made into a hit by Luther Vandross.\n\n“I believe that Primary Wave can add value to my existing catalogue and support my current writing endeavors with both established and new artists,” Russell said in a statement. “They have a passion for the creation of music that is only matched by the people that make the music themselves.”\n\n— Mirrorball Entertainment, the production company founded in 2013 by Stefan Skarbek and Tony Maserati, has signed a deal to have the Universal Music Publishing Group serve as worldwide administrator for its current Mirrorball Publishing catalog, and will partner with UMPG on future signings.\n\nThe Mirrrorball Publishing roster includes the Coast Modern duo of Luke Atlas and Coleman Trapp; Total Navajo’s Mitch Rowland and Ryan Nasci, who both contributed writing on Harry Styles‘ album; and Jon Castelli, who recently co-wrote material on Kim Petras’ latest release; as well as Micah Jasper, Matt Wiggers, Sac White, Dom Corleone, Jackie Vae and Lola Coca. The deal with Universal came about through Robin Godfrey Cass, who manages Skarbek, and who also had entered into a consultancy role with UMPG, making this the first deal under that arrangement."
