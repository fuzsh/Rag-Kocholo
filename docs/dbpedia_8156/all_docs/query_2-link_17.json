        "text": "Brenda Russell lives in the here-and-now, immediately obeying her impulses. She is guided by a fire burning within her. She rarely heed the warnings of reflection and reason; instead, she listens to her instincts, as if her unconscious were perpetually emerging. This is the source of her spontaneity and passion. Because she is continually being born, she champions all phenomena symbolic of birth: breaking ground, beginning, clearing. She has little interest for pursuing the new ideas she brought into being, because her inner flame is always urging her to move on quickly to the next innovation. She is not a good manager. She is straightforward. When she commits herself, she does so with mind, body, and soul. Restraint and moderation are concepts which are totally foreign to her, because she lives by the fullness of her instinct, the force of her desire. Due to her energetic temperament, her determination immediately invents the action necessary to fulfill her desires. It goes without saying that her attitude engenders certain risks. Sometimes her impetuousness, or a lack of maturity or patience, or a keen appetite for experience leads her into a blind alley. But risk is a part of her life. Since her fervor is immune to calculation, second thoughts, and cunning, she has no fear. She is the type of hero whose courageous deeds are difficult to distinguish from acts of bravado or of sheer foolhardiness. Her top priority is to take action, immediately. Delay is torture to her. She is in a hurry to live, to take her urges and impulses to their ultimate conclusion, even though her lack of forethought may actually make her goal take longer to accomplish.\n\nShe rarely evaluates obstacles objectively: instead, she dashes into the fray, bristling with determination, oblivious to the size or scope of the difficulties. She rides home triumphantly, whether she has battered her head against a brick wall or met no resistance whatsoever. But she has a true hero’s courage and vitality. She is undaunted by challenges and real danger, to the surprise of outside observers. Like everyone, she sometimes experiences failure. But she rarely despair or become overly discouraged by it; it never overcomes her.\n\nShe doesn’t see it as a tragedy; she just figures she missed that time, but next time, she won’t. In fact, she’ll muster even more strength and power for the next attack, since she is convinced she can succeed.\n\nShe sometimes has problems finishing\n\nBrenda Russell is dynamic. She needs to attract admiration and release her excess energy.\n\nBrenda Russell needs others to fulfill herself and accomplish her ambitions.\n\nAt the time of your birth, your rising sign was located in Leo (the Lion), while the sun was passing through the sign of Aries (the Ram). A summary of the various clues mentioned above provide your personality profile. The following key words capture the essence of your character and indicate certain contradictions which may be sources of tension: Individualism – Determination – Vitality and passion – Pride and self-assurance – Pugnacity – Superiority – Impatience – Brilliance – Impetuosity – Generosity – Enterprise – Positivism – Innovation.\n\nYour personality is essentially that of a passionate leader. You are too proud to reveal your own feelings of vulnerability but are likely to reconcile them by projecting them onto others, becoming the defender of the helpless and protector of the meek – roles that further flatter your self-image. You are a determined individual who is not afraid to take risks, and you are also very optimistic and courageous. You are very proud of your individuality, and you are not afraid to stand up for what you believe in. You are also very generous, and you are often very eager to start new projects. You are very innovative, and you are always looking for new ways to improve your own productivity.\n\nBorn seven to ten days after the rising of the new moon, you are said to be a “first quarter” lunar type. This “soli-lunar” configuration means that your character is strong-willed and sometimes proud, always determined to buck convention and innovate. Monotony is unbearable to you, and you chafe under the yoke of routine. As a result, you often run into trouble with authority figures. When overwhelmed by your conscience, you rave about how destructive it is to long for the past, how ridiculous it is to be old-fashioned, and how obsolete the old values are. Generally speaking, your monthly energy flow crests about seven to ten-and-a-half days after the full moon. You would be wise to schedule intensive work phases at that time, as well as ambitious and demanding projects. At that time, your initiatives will be most successful, especially if you are trying to create something new, original, and cutting-edge!\n\nBrenda Russell is attracted to this relationship because it has the potential to be very compatible and powerful. The physical and psychological reality of her personality will exert a magnetic pull over the sensitivity, receptivity, tenderness, and other key qualities of her partner.\n\nBrenda Russell’s moon is located at 16° Leo. Her ideal match is a partner with the sun at 10/22° Leo or AQUARIUS.\n\nBrenda Russell would be particularly well-matched to someone who mirrors her underlying psychic and unconscious aspirations. The secret ideal she cherished of the perfect partner would be aroused; it would harmonize beautifully with her ideal imaginary lover. This great psychic compatibility is the result of a harmonious relationship between the moon of the masculine chart and the sun of the feminine one. It is propitious to a rich flow of energies between the most hidden and secret parts of both people. They are linked by an unconscious emotional bond.\n\nBrenda Russell’s Venus is located at 16° ARIES. Her ideal match is a partner with Mars at 10/22° ARIES or LIBRA.\n\nBrenda Russell finds a partner that complements her perfectly in emotional and sentimental terms. This person reflects and fulfills her ideal of sensuality to the greatest degree. Moreover, her ideal partner resonates lastingly with her own psychic projections of her ideal. This positive relationship between the unconscious sexual yearnings of both partners is likely to yield sensual relations of a tantalizingly mysterious and secret nature.\n\nBrenda Russell is fiery, impetuous, and sometimes direct in the expression of her feelings. She is prone to love at first sight as well as great passion. She would be especially attracted by the same qualities of frankness and boldness in another. This type of partner would respect her independence while being devoted and affectionate.\n\nBrenda Russell’s planet Mars is located at 13° Aries. Her ideal match is a partner with Venus at 7/19° Aries or LIBRA."
