Knight\n\n“I believe…as I believe that the sun has risen: not only because I see it, but because by it I see everything else.” -C.S. Lewis\n\n(Downtown Boston, Massachusetts) Dear stars and dear trees: For all of my life, I’d been closeted about my consumption of musicals. But after witnessing the musical revival of Alice Walker’s The Color Purple, Celie and Sophie have officially folded me into musical theatre, and I want to stay swaddled in the feeling of this lively genre.

Brief nudity is used to abruptly symbolize the stark differences between the lives of Shug and Celie. Prudes should stay at home.\n\n2. This is a musical predominantly about Black women. The only role White people play are as silent, historically accurate oppressors. Racists and sexists won’t enjoy themselves either.\n\n(Boston) The Color Purple is exquisite. It is a tour deforce presentation of musical theatre at its finest. With only one small hiccup, this production achieves greatness on the stage. Run, do not walk, as fast as you are able and get tickets to this show. Do it. Continue reading →"
