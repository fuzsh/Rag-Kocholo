        "text": "I did a recent Google search for \"Brenda Russell gay\" after watching her \"Piano In The Dark\" YT video to see if she had ever given any gay press interviews & it looks like she has stood by her anti-gay dad in the past who supports gay conversion therapy.\n\nA 3-21-19 reply to someone on Twitter revealed that she still supports this position. I've never posted a link to Twitter on here before.\n\nHave any of you heard about this before?\n\nI did a Brenda Russell DL search but nothing came up on her.\n\nDiscuss.\n\nR1 She was a black pop singer who had her biggest successes in the 80s. Her song \"Piano In The Dark\" (posted above in the OP link) is her biggest claim to fame.\n\nThe song peaked at #6 here in the US back in 1988.\n\nIt reached the #23 slot both in Canada & the UK the same year.\n\nCheryl Ladd's biggest hit single, \"Think it Over\" (1978), from her self-titled debut album, was written by Brian and Brenda Russell. The next year, Brenda recorded a better version of the song for her self-titled debut album.\n\nInterestingly, Cheryl was the first to release \"I Know I'll Never Love This Way Again\" from this debut album in 1978, but it failed to chart. However, it became a smash hit for Dionne Warwick the following year.\n\nIt seems like somebody misunderstood what happened here.\n\nThe homophobic actress who is referenced in the tweets of Brenda Russell and others is Seyi Omooba, who garnered brief notoriety after being cast as Celie in a musical stage production of \"The Color Purple\", and then fired after her archaic, Christian fundy views on homosexuality came to light.\n\nBrenda Russell wrote songs for the production, which is why she tweeted about the \"acctress\".\n\nThis gets twisted into \"Brenda Russell is a homophobic cunt\" because people don't pay attention to what they're reading, and are too lazy to be bothered with the process of actually verifying a claim.\n\nThanks for posting that, r14. When I looked at the tweet in question, I was like, \"Wait a minute...\" Some people on this site could SERIOUSLY do with some basic reading comprehension lessons.\n\nAnd people who immediately start spouting off without even bothering to read the source are just as bad any brainless Deplorable. It's unfortunate there are so many on the left as well.\n\nR14 R16 I saw Brenda Russell's response to the Tweet about the anti-gay dad & also knew she was close to both Donna Summers, Oleta Adams & Cheryl Ladd (all three have appeared on the 700 Club over its history). so like R9 I assumed \"birds of a feather flock together\". Most black celebrity women don't call out their peers for their anti-gay remarks/actions (See Gloria Gaynor, Donna Summer,etc.). If the above tweet isn't her response to a fan about her own views then BR could've been more insightful in her response & less vague. I looked up her wiki & it diidn't mention anything major about her dad except that he died in 2019 & was a member of The Ink Spots (never even heard of them).\n\nR14 Nobody called BR a cunt so maybe because you're the one who isn't paying attention to what you are reading & are too lazy to be bothered with getting your facts straight. I made this thread to discuss Brenda Russell in general so that's why I put the word DISCUSS at the bottom of my thread to clarify the situation.\n\nCheryl Ladd appeared on the cover of AARP magazine with Brenda’s grandchild and referred to the baby as Brian and Cheryl’s grandchild.\n\nDonna and Oleta recorded Brenda’s songs that doesn’t mean she was particularly close to them. I don’t think Brenda liked donnas version of dinner with Gershwin so she recorded her own a few years later."
