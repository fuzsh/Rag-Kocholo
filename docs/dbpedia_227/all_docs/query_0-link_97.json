        "text": "Geoff Bennett:\n\nThe new film \"Civil War\" is stirring debate and provoking conversation about where a divided nation could lead.\n\nIt topped the domestic box office this weekend with a nearly $26 million opening, the biggest ever for its independent production company, A24 Studios.\n\nJeffrey Brown talks to the film's director as part of our arts and culture series, Canvas.\n\nJeffrey Brown:\n\nWe don't know why this is happening, what fActors brought the country to the brink. We just see and feel what it could be like if America really was at war with itself.\n\nAlex Garland:\n\nI would define them as a real concern about the power and growth of extremist thinking within your country, my country, and many European countries.\n\nThe essence of the film in political terms is absolutely extremist versus centrist, yes. It is, what happens when extremists are not limited in their journey?\n\nJeffrey Brown:\n\nWho's good or bad, right or wrong, right or left? We don't really know. This is a kind of warning, but it's for us to fill in the details.\n\nThe details, the politics are less important than just putting us in this place?\n\nAlex Garland:\n\nI would question your use of the word politics, because the use you are using of politics is a politics which is defined by left and right. And the one I'm talking about is not left versus right. It's extremist versus centrist.\n\nAlex Garland:\n\nFor me, it categorically is a political film. It's just not choosing a politics of left and right.\n\nI think that, if I sat down and asked somebody, why might your country or my country disintegrate into a state of civil war, they would know the answers. I don't need to spell them out. Those answers surround us. So, I felt it would be not just patronizing, but redundant, to spell it out.\n\nJeffrey Brown:\n\nAnd that means, in this case, putting us into this position that we can recognize all these places and some of these people perhaps, then letting us figure out what's going on?\n\nAlex Garland:\n\nExactly, yes, exactly, which, to me, is related to the other subject matter in the film, which is to do with the press.\n\nIn a way, it is trying to take a certain kind of leading bias out of the film and making the film function like reporters, and then it is showing as its protagonist reporters.\n\nJeffrey Brown:\n\nIssues Garland himself had to confront.\n\nWhat were the key decisions in your thinking about what to show, what not to show, how much to give, how much not to sensationalize?\n\nAlex Garland:\n\nI hope it hasn't really sensationalized anything. I would argue it has not.\n\nFilm is traditionally — for a long time has been incredibly concerned with spelling everything out for an audience, and not leaving things up to the audience, in terms of their own decision-making processes or their personal responses. I just choose to make films where I assume a certain level of interest in the audience in asking questions, thinking about the answers, posing them in the way they want to pose them, and coming to their own conclusions.\n\nAnd I don't object to that. I encourage it. I like it.\n\nJeffrey Brown:\n\nGarland is nothing if not ambitious in the subjects he takes on, including artificial intelligence and what it means to be alive in 2014's \"Ex Machina\" and toxic masculinity in the film \"Men\" in 2022.\n\nReactions to \"Civil War\" have included questioning the ethics of even making a film like this that might itself further promote violence or division. Garland says he can't predict any such response, but:\n\nAlex Garland:\n\nI do know that silencing people also leads to trouble, that there is — there's an issue to do with the freezing out of opinions in a public space and the shouting down of opinions within a public space that is its own sort of problem.\n\nSo we're not living in a perfect world where every decision could be made with exact prediction of how it will work out. What we're living in a world is where we have to think and act like adults and understand the messy, confusing state and do the best we can with it.\n\nAlex Garland:\n\nIn my dream scenario, which I'm aware will probably not exist, they would see it as a kind of treatise against extremist thinking.\n\nI hope they find it thought-provoking in a way that is interesting. They may be provoked in other ways. It might make them angry. That's part of the risk one takes. There's a complicated thing there within cinema is that films often exist really to please people. I do not want to make people angry, but I do not just want to please them."
