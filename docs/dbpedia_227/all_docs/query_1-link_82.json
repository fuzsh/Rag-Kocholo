        "text": "Movies allow us to look through the window and get a glimpse of a better understanding of others. A girl next door who wears a hijab and buys fresh bread every morning, a baker who goes to church every Sunday, children in the street chattering in an unfamiliar language, and maybe a bus driver who seems to be always gloomy and angry, but only because he is very concerned about his mother’s health. Some were born in the same country as you. Others were forced to flee from war leaving behind their families and home. Some take everything from life, while others give everything they have to their children. Movies allow us to embrace the feeling of being a person with a different past, of another origin or faith. Movies make us closer to other cultures. We are getting surprised, shocked, outraged, and sympathetic to the heroes. And that, of course, makes us more humane and closer to each other.\n\nTo watch a movie is the simplest routine task we can do to know more about the displaced.

It was nominated for Oscar in 2019. The film featured amateur actors. People were found after a street-casting in Beirut.
