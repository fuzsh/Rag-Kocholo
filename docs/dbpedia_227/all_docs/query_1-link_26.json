        "text": "Tim Roth has taken on an awful lot in his directorial debut, The War Zone, with a screenplay by Alexander Stuart from his 1989 novel about incest. It is a measure of Roth's seriousness and good faith as a fledgling film-maker that what he has attempted for his first picture is not thin Brit-pic comedy, nor derivative post-ironic violence of the sort that made him famous as an actor, but a challenging realist movie in the tradition of Ken Loach and Alan Clarke.\n\nSo it is dismaying that this film misfires so catastrophically, ending up as what can only be described as a soft-core child abuse drama, reeking of good intentions and middlebrow art-house good taste.\n\nThe War Zone is about a London family who have upped sticks to a remote Devon cottage. Dad (Ray Winstone) is in the furniture and antiques business, dealing and restoring, while Mum (Tilda Swinton) deals with the children: 18-year-old Jess (Lara Belmont) and her moody, hormonal younger brother Tom (Freddie Cunliffe). City boy Tom bitterly resents the move to the country, and Mum has just given birth again, the newborn's arrival bringing with it the usual minute tensions and jealousies.\n\nIt is in this fraught situation that Tom accidentally catches sight of Jess in the bath with Dad. He confronts her in private; she denies it, unconvincingly, and he spies on her, following her to a deserted concrete shelter on the cliffs where he sees her being sodomised by her father. Now Tom is not merely in shock, but in denial of feelings of jealous rage and guilt about his own furtive, unacknowledged passion for Jess. The film ends with a heavy-metal power chord of horror: the baby is taken to hospital, where the nursing staff discover his nappy filled with blood, apparently from the anus.\n\nIt is almost unwatchable, for all the wrong reasons. The sheer maladroitness, and earnestness with which the abusive relationship is plonked under our noses - a colossal prize marrow of an \"issue\" - apparently demanding nothing more than our contrite acknowledgement of its existence, is truly wince-making. And the dramatic representation of the human relations from which this abuse springs consistently falls just the wrong side of being convincing.\n\nFor a start, there is The War Zone's muddled and unsatisfactory take on class. Winstone plays Dad with a strong cockney accent, though his job is, rightly or wrongly, generally associated with the bourgeois artisan. In Stuart's novel, in fact, Dad seems more middle class, albeit a bit of a wide boy; he can, for example, speak fluent French. That aspect of Dad is excised in the film; the character is clearly demoted on the social scale to something closer to the abusive father Winstone played in Gary Oldman's Nil by Mouth. At one stage, he comes home after a hard day's graft in the furniture, decor and fittings business, and leans mutteringly over the grimy sink while Mum swabs him down with a flannel for all the world as if he'd done a 14-hour shift down the pit.\n\nDad's socio-cultural downshift leaves Swinton adrift, with a rather self-conscious and actressy performance. And, more seriously, it leaves us with the unfortunate but unmistakeable impression that a working-class guy abusing his daughter is considered more appropriate cinematic realism than a middle-class guy doing it.\n\nThe problem with The War Zone is not that it is too explicit; it is not explicit enough . Where the Winstone character's terrifying assault on his wife in Nil by Mouth arose from an explicitly delineated and dramatically intelligible set of social and emotional circumstances, the behaviour of Dad here is mysterious, free-floating, quite devoid of any successfully imagined context. A film-maker cannot simply place a scene of horrifying abuse in front of us, and expect to hitch a free ride from the gut-wrenching emotional charge this will naturally deliver. And he certainly cannot assume that it will generate anything resembling a \"debate\".\n\nRoth evidently cares about the issue, but we need to care about the people. Why does Dad do this to Jess? Why does Jess allow him to do it? And if these things are obscure because they are seen from Tom's stunned and baffled point of view, then the director must persuade us that his self-absorbed anger is as cinematically and dramatically valid as a clear, compelling exploration of Jess's and Dad's feelings. But what we get is a lot of Tom's prurient gazing at Jess's breasts and being taken by Jess on a preposterous sexual escapade to London to visit her friend Carol and \"get him laid\".\n\nThere are valuable aspects to The War Zone: Winstone is a heavyweight actor who could never give a bad performance; Belmont is outstanding; and Seamus McGarvey's cinematography, showing the gloomy, torpid spaces of the Devon countryside, is assured. But the central failure of The War Zone is unavoidable: the failure to make us understand, or to care."
