        "text": "Just before Sunday night’s Oscars, I got an email from Jonathan Glazer, director of the Holocaust film The Zone of Interest, who asked if he could use a line of mine from an interview in his Oscars speech, should he be fortunate enough to be called upon to make one. Of course I coolly responded something like “sure, whatevs”, around 30 seconds after the message arrived – and lo, a few hours later my words were being broadcast around the world when Glazer’s film went on to win Best International Picture.\n\nMy point he borrowed – and which I was only able to put into words after seeing his film in the first place – was that The Zone of Interest is a one-of-a-kind Holocaust film because rather than telling its audience “look at what they did”, it says “look at what we do”. And that alone makes it a markedly different beast to Christopher Nolan’s Oppenheimer, the film which won seven gongs to The Zone of Interest’s two, and also plays out during the Second World War.\n\nOppenheimer more than earned its prizes, including Best Picture. Its execution is breathtaking. But like much of Nolan’s work, it’s the sort of film that happens to you: its director’s rollercoaster style sends the audience hurtling up and down Oppenheimer’s own personal arcs of dazzling discovery and existential torment. It depicts great figures of the past wrestling with very big issues - war and high politics - worlds away from the average man or woman’s experience. And its toggling between intimate and epic scales sets it in the same filmmaking tradition as Lawrence of Arabia – with the sort of classical dazzle and bombast that David Lean would have loved.\n\nGlazer’s, on the other hand, includes much that is mundane and familiar to us all, from gardening to a family picnic. One of the more seismic plot threads involves the main character’s mother-in-law coming to visit. The pacing is as slow and methodical as ordinary life. Also, it isn’t entirely experienced in the cinema: it only really comes together on a second, invisible screen in the viewer’s mind. And that makes it by far the more pressing, implicatory watch.\n\nThis is a Holocaust film that defies every last convention of the form. It contains no images of abduction or mass slaughter. The most physically violent event shown on screen is probably a teenage boy locking his upset younger brother in a greenhouse. That greenhouse, however, is located in a very particular spot. It stands in the garden of the large and airy staff villa which belongs to Rudolf Höss, the commandant of the Nazi concentration camp at Auschwitz. Just over the wall stands the camp itself, where around 1.1 million prisoners, overwhelmingly Jews from Hungary and Poland, were murdered under Höss’s charge. As the younger boy unhappily pleads to be let out, his older sibling makes the sound of hissing gas.\n\nThis is the form of evil Glazer’s film is about: not the killing itself, but the ways in which ordinary humans calmly and unthinkingly refit their lives to make space for it. The garden abutting hell is an image worthy of Blake, but there is nothing fantastical about the Höss family’s life. In fact, it’s rather lovely, and when Höss’s mother-in-law comes to stay, she tells her daughter how lucky she is to have carved out this wonderful space for herself and her children, before idly speculating whether a Jewish acquaintance might be “over there”, and if so, what became of her lovely curtains."
