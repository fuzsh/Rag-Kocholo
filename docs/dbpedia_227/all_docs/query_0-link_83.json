        "text": "The story of a Truro man killed in Ukraine after rescuing hundreds of people from the front line has been turned into a documentary.\n\nThe BBC film Hell Jumper features the work of 28-year-old Chris Parry, who went to the country shortly after it was invaded by Russia more than two years ago.\n\nMr Parry died from gunshot wounds alongside fellow volunteer Andrew Bagshaw in January 2023.\n\nThe film, documenting Mr Parry's actions, has just had its premiere for family and friends at Truro's Plaza Cinema, and is due to be shown on BBC2 on 24 July, as well as being available on the BBC iPlayer.\n\nThe term \"hell jumper\" refers to those who go into the Ukrainian warzone to bring people out to safety.\n\nMr Parry helped rescue more than 400 people before being shot by Russian mercenaries.\n\nMuch of his work is captured on 10 hours of bodycam footage, which makes up a large part of the film.\n\nDirector Paddy Wivell said he developed a huge respect for Mr Parry and his actions after studying the recordings.\n\nHe said: \"It was in those pieces that I felt extraordinary admiration for him and thinking I could not do that, I am not brave in that way.\n\n\"I came to understand that he would not stop until he found the people he was going to evacuate.\n\n\"So, I really wanted to honour that process in the film and keep that section of the film quite long so the audience felt they were truly immersed in his experience, and in the danger that he was confronting.\"\n\nOne of Chris Parry's closest friends, Freya Osborne, was among those in the audience at the premiere screening and appears in the film.\n\nShe said: \"In a really bizarre way, it was actually really lovely.\n\n\"I think a little boy from Truro, saving all those lives and putting himself in danger - it's incredible that there's such light in such horribleness.\"\n\nThe film was produced by Adriana Timco, who heard of Mr Parry's story and knew it needed to be told to a wider audience.\n\nShe said: \"I found him so incredibly endearing as a person.\n\n\"He said: 'I'm a man with a van and I want to help in any way I can.'\n\n\"He told me about his year in Ukraine - he was full of energy, so full of drive and so full of purpose, and said the war had completely changed him as a person - all the horrors he had seen.\n\n\"He started sending me footage and said: 'If anything ever happens to me, I would like my family to have something of me.'\n\n\"I never ever thought that this would come true.\n\n\"It gives me goose bumps now, but I made him a promise.\""
