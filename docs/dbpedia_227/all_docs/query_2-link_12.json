        "text": "Looking to fuel up your Netflix queue with some high-octane action?\n\nWhether you're a fan of wild Westerns, cunning detectives, high-swinging superheroes, ravenous zombies, charming assassins, or hard-hitting heroines, Netflix has a movie pitch-perfect for every kind of adrenaline seeker. But scrolling through the app can be a chore when all you want to do is Netflix and chill. We've taken out the hard step, highlighting the most stunt-stuffed, battle-powered, high-speed films the streamer has to offer.\n\nHere are the 20 best action movies on Netflix, streaming right now.\n\n20. Everything Everywhere All at Once\n\nWant a movie with a little bit of everything? Then you can't beat the 2023 Oscar winner for Best Picture. Academy Award-winner Michelle Yeoh stars as a disgruntled Laundromat owner who's at her wit's end between her obligations as a boss, wife, mother, and daughter. And just as she's braced to deal with a tax auditor with a surly attitude (Academy Award–winner Jamie Lee Curtis), a dashing version of her husband (Academy Award–winner Ke Huy Quan) bursts onto the scene from a parallel universe to loop her into a quest to save all existence. Packed with absolutely bonkers action, outrageous jokes, dizzying style, and performances as silly as they are deeply poignant, The Daniels' Everything Everywhere All at Once is the kind of movie that'll have you laughing, crying, gasping, and maybe even reconsidering your life up to now. — Kristy Puchko, Entertainment Editor\n\nHow to watch: Everything Everywhere All at Once is now streaming on Netflix.\n\n19. Damsel\n\nNetflix has invested big in Millie Bobby Brown. Not only has the English ingenue been leading Stranger Things for years, but also she's becoming an outright action star through movies she has headlined and produced for the streamer, including a pair of Enola Holmes adventures and this fearsome fairy tale: Damsel. Here, Brown stars as Elodie, a dutiful damsel destined to wed a handsome prince (Nick Robinson)! But rather than happily ever after, her deceitful groom pitches her into a dragon's pit. However, that's far from the end of her story. She'll fight her way to salvation and vengeance, one fiery sequence at a time.\n\nIn her review, Mashable's Belen Edwards wrote, \"Boasting some inventive twists and a heartfelt lead performance from Brown, Damsel may not be groundbreaking fantasy, but it is a thrilling ride.\" — K.P.\n\nHow to watch: Damsel is now streaming on Netflix.\n\n18. The Woman King\n\nIt might be a cliche to say \"This is the role they were born to play!\" But when you witness the storming glory of Viola Davis as a hard-fighting general in The Woman King, that thought hits hard, fast, and repeatedly, like one's heartbeat as this historical epic kicks into action mode.\n\nIn promoting the film, Davis has spoken openly about all the ways it's the kind of movie that Hollywood's supposed conventional wisdom — which caters predominantly to white and male audiences — said could never be made. Davis is a 57-year-old, dark-skinned Black woman, and she's headlining a war movie in which she gets to be the titular protagonist and kicks slavers' ass. As she expressed before the film's World Premiere at the 2022 Toronto International Film Festival, she's living her dream in this film. And for us, it was exhilarating to live vicariously through her.\n\nInspired by the Agojie of West Africa, The Woman King explores the passions, problems, and camaraderie of this all-female band of warriors. While Davis dazzles at its center, co-stars Thuso Mbedu, Sheila Atim, and Lashana Lynch shine alongside her. Each brings powerful charisma to a full-throated performance that keeps audiences equally riveted through scenes of battle or blossoming romance, gut-punching grief or pugnacious celebration. As she did with The Old Guard, Gina Prince-Bythewood marries action with emotion, creating sequences that make our pulses race and our hearts shudder.* — K.P.\n\nHow to watch: The Woman King is now streaming on Netflix.\n\n17. Cold Pursuit\n\nPatron saint of action Liam Neeson headlines this icy thriller that's an English-language remake of 2014 Norwegian film In Order of Disappearance (Kraftidioten). Here, Neeson plays Nels Coxman, a snowplow driver whose job in his Colorado community is so key that he's been awarded Citizen of the Year. But when his beloved son dies of a drug overdose, Nels readies to clear away more than snow. With a thirst for vengeance and a sawed off shotgun, he hunts down the cartel that's corrupted his community — and its bloody thrilling to witness. Edged with a dark sense of humor, Cold Pursuit is wicked fun. — K.P.\n\nHow to watch: Cold Pursuit is now streaming on Netflix.\n\n16. RRR\n\nYou've never seen an action movie quite as bombastic or as bromantic as RRR. Director S.S. Rajamouli draws loosely from history to tell the story of Indian freedom fighters Alluri Sitarama Raju (Ram Charan) and Komaram Bheem (N.T. Rama Rao Jr.). Over the film's three-hour runtime, the two unwittingly face off in the search for a kidnapped girl, become the best of friends, and square off against villainous English colonizers.\n\nAny of RRR's action sequences would be the pinnacle of a lesser action movie, but the film seems determined to outdo itself with showstopper after showstopper. Take when Raju faces down hundreds of protesters and wins, or when Bheem fights a tiger bare-handed. Would you believe me if I told you those happen within the first 20 minutes? The action — and the movie — only get more awesome from there. — Belen Edwards, Entertainment Reporter\n\nHow to watch: RRR is now streaming on Netflix.\n\n15. The Harder They Fall\n\nPut 'em up, as this is hands-down one of the best action movies in the Wild West.\n\nDirected by Jeymes Samuel, The Harder They Fall defiantly redefines the predominantly white Western, boasting an incredible cast of Black stars: Jonathan Majors, Idris Elba, Regina King, Zazie Beetz, LaKeith Stanfield, and Delroy Lindo. A tale of heroes and villains, the film follows Nat Love (Majors) on his quest for revenge against the formidable Rufus Buck (Elba). But he'll have to make his gunslinging way through \"Treacherous\" Trudy Smith (Regina King) and Cherokee Bill (Stanfield) first. Even before the opening credits roll, you'll fall hard for this one. — Shannon Connellan, UK Editor\n\nHow to watch: The Harder They Fall is now streaming on Netflix.\n\n14. Enola Holmes\n\nSherlock Holmes's much cooler little sister is an overlooked young action hero in Enola Holmes. Based on author Nancy Springer's popular book series The Enola Holmes Mysteries, the film puts the great detective's savvy 16-year-old sibling on the case, played with energetic spoonfuls of gumption by Stranger Things star Millie Bobby Brown. She's set to solve the greatest mystery of her young life: to find her missing mother (Helena Bonham Carter) through a series of deliberately cryptic clues — all while breaking the fourth wall and confiding in the audience, thanks to Fleabag director Harry Bradbeer and His Dark Materials' Jack Thorne's sharp screenplay.\n\nStepping into the footsteps of her famous brother Sherlock (Henry Cavill) and avoiding those of her stuffier misogynist brother Mycroft (Sam Claflin), Enola's case leads her on a wild ride through Victorian-era England, with more than a few fistfights and butts to kick along the way. And lucky for you, the sequel is even better. — S.C.\n\nHow to watch: Enola Holmes is now streaming on Netflix.\n\n13. 65\n\nSometimes, you get the urge to watch an Oscar-nominated actor blast a bunch of dinosaurs with a laser gun. And when that urge sneaks up on you, the only cure is 65.\n\n65 is built around the genius premise that is \"Adam Driver fights dinosaurs,\" and boy, does it deliver. As Mills, a pilot from a super advanced civilization from 65 million years ago, Driver crash-lands on prehistoric Earth, where he headshots a T. Rex, bludgeons a raptor, and much, much more. He also takes the time to bond with his one fellow survivor, a young girl named Koa (Barbie's Ariana Greenblatt). The result is a sweet \"lone wolf and cub\" movie full of dino-sized thrills, kills, and a very threatening asteroid. — B.E.\n\nMashable Top Stories\n\nStay connected with the hottest stories of the day and the latest entertainment news.\n\nSign up for Mashable's Top Stories newsletter\n\nBy signing up you agree to our Terms of Use and Privacy Policy.\n\nThanks for signing up!\n\nHow to watch: 65 is now streaming on Netflix.\n\n12. They Cloned Tyrone\n\nWith this 2023 release, co-writer/director Juel Taylor pulls plenty of inspiration from Blaxploitation. John Boyega, Jamie Foxx, and Teyonah Parris star as a drug dealer, a pimp, and a sex worker who undercover a nefarious conspiracy that's happening underneath their neighborhood. Taylor and fellow screenwriter Tony Rettenmaier weave in wild twists, fly fight scenes, irreverent humor, and swaggering style for what our critic called \"a propulsive comedy-thriller with weight.\" As bold as it is star-studded, you won't want to miss They Cloned Tyrone. And stay for the credits, trust us. — K.P.\n\nHow to watch: They Cloned Tyrone is now streaming on Netflix.\n\n11. Kill Boksoon\n\nGil Bok-Soon (Jeon Do-yeon) is a single mother who often finds herself at odds with her teenage daughter. She's also a highly skilled and successful assassin. Kill Boksoon is a fantastic action film that sees its main character head straight from a brutal killing to the grocery store so she can get dinner on the table. It's one hell of a hook that sucks you in immediately. The fight scenes are hypnotic and the cinematography ambitious and exciting. It's a gripping thriller that makes plenty of space for the complex emotional reality of its characters.* — Kristina Grosspietsch, Freelance Contributor\n\nHow to watch: Kill Boksoon is now streaming on Netflix.\n\n10. Triple Frontier\n\nThis Netflix adventure has Ben Affleck, Oscar Isaac, Charlie Hunnam, Garrett Hedlund, and Pedro Pascal coming together as a group of former Special Forces who plan an elaborate heist in South America. But after things get out of hand, their survival skills are put to the ultimate test.\n\nPutting a talented cast in a tension-filled scenario, Triple Frontier is the type of gritty thriller that's hard to turn away from. — Brooke Bajgrowicz, Entertainment Fellow\n\nHow to watch: Triple Frontier is now streaming on Netflix.\n\n9. Okja\n\nBlending drama with fantasy/adventure and weaving in a very real message about the horrors of the meat industry, Bong Joon-ho's Okja is a beautifully unique creature feature, striped with action.\n\nThe film follows Mina (Ahn Seo-hyun), the granddaughter of a farmer in South Korea who has spent the last 10 years rearing a genetically modified super-pig called Okja as part of a breeding project spearheaded by a grim U.S. corporation. This movie is dark in places, magical in others, and poignant overall, asking us to stop and reflect on the dark side of an industry the majority of us are complicit in. Tilda Swinton and Jake Gyllenhaal make for an entertaining pair of villains, too.* — Sam Haysom, Deputy UK Editor\n\nHow to watch: Okja is now streaming on Netflix.\n\n8. Looper\n\nLike your action with a heady mix of sci-fi and Western? Then you'll love Rian Johnson's time-travel thriller Looper. Joseph Gordon-Levitt stars as Joe, a specialized brand of hitman, who only kills people sent back from the future by a tyrannical kingpin. But when Joe's future self (played by Bruce Willis) turns up and makes a swift escape, it's a battle against himself that's fated to get intense. Between its Kansas City setting, unique time travel rules, and a crackling cast that includes Emily Blunt, Paul Dano, and Jeff Daniels, Looper is a unique spin on a hired gun tale with a finale that is jaw-droppingly awesome. — K.P.\n\nHow to watch: Looper is now streaming on Netflix.\n\n7. Da 5 Bloods\n\nSpike Lee copters audiences back to the Vietnam War with Da 5 Bloods, a daring film that's part drama, part war movie, and part heist flick. Named for a squad of Black U.S. Army soldiers of the 1st Infantry Division, Lee's critically heralded 2020 joint follows this band of brothers through a treacherous war zone, then rediscovers them in a present where they're seeking to uncover the past — and a big payday.\n\nSequences of brutal battles, narrow escapes, and high-tension hijinks make Da 5 Bloods an enthralling watch. Though inspired by history, it's impossible to predict where Lee's story will lead. Our guides on this intense journey through time, loss, war, and brotherhood are Delroy Lindo, Jonathan Majors, Clarke Peters, Norm Lewis, Isiah Whitlock Jr., and the late Chadwick Boseman. Together, they and Lee create an American war film that can't be missed. — K.P.\n\nHow to watch: Da 5 Bloods is now streaming on Netflix.\n\n6. The Quick and the Dead\n\nSam Raimi is best known for stomach-churning horror (Evil Dead, Drag Me to Hell) or larger-than-life superhero adventures (The OG Spider-Man trilogy, Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness). But between these phases of a funky filmography, the cult-adored director tried his hand at a Western with The Quick and the Dead. And it's a weird but wonderful watch.\n\nSharon Stone stars as a hardened wanderer known as \"The Lady\" who blows into the Old West town of Redemption with a dark secret and a snarl for fools. There, a fast-draw tournament spills blood and drama in the main thoroughfare, all under the piercing stare of tyrant John Herod (Gene Hackman). Rolling through like furious tumbleweeds are a cast of colorful characters, from young guns to battered pacifists to surly straight shooters, played by the likes of Leonardo DiCaprio, Russell Crowe, Keith David, Lance Henriksen, Tobin Bell, and Gary Sinise. If that cast list alone doesn't have you adding this one to your queue, then we're very different people, pardner. But maybe the promise of a string of suspenseful shoot-outs will win you over? — K.P.\n\nHow to watch: The Quick and the Dead is now streaming on Netflix.\n\n5. Army of the Dead\n\nSometimes all you want is to grab hold of that action-o-meter and crank the dial, hard, to a solid 11. Army of the Dead more than delivers on that front, opening with a musical montage of guns and exploding body parts — and it only gets gorier from there. Zack Snyder's story follows a band of mercenaries hired to steal $200 million from a casino in Las Vegas. The problem? Vegas has been invaded by zombies, the city is quarantined, and the military is planning to blow the entire thing up with a tactical nuclear strike. The sprawling cast includes Dave Bautista, Omari Hardwick, Hiroyuki Sanada, Garret Dillahunt, and Ana de la Reguera, as well as a digitally added Tig Notaro.\n\nWhat follows is a gloriously silly romp that refuses to take itself too seriously, propelling us through a series of explosions and bullets while the story twists and turns through a 148-minute runtime that feels oh, so much shorter. — S.H.\n\nHow to watch: Army of the Dead is now streaming on Netflix.\n\n4. The Old Guard\n\nFolks looking for that summer blockbuster thrill, search no further than The Old Guard. Based on the superhero comic books of the same name, director Gina Prince-Bythewood's movie sucks viewers into a slick, well-crafted world of action and narrative that isn't particularly unique but delivers its formulaic pieces with enough precision to keep you invested.\n\nCharlize Theron crushes as the ass-kicking leader of an immortal warrior fight crew, with performances by Harry Melling, Marwan Kenzari, KiKi Layne, Chiwetel Ejiofor, Veronica Ngo, Matthias Schoenaerts, and more.* — Alison Foreman, Entertainment Reporter\n\nHow to watch: The Old Guard is now streaming on Netflix.\n\n3. Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse\n\nThe Spider-Verse movies continue to raise the bar for superhero movies, and it’s hard to imagine one better than the latest installment, Across the Spider-Verse. The sequel to 2018’s Into the Spider-Verse manages to have even more dazzling animation, more jaw-dropping action sequences, and even bigger doses of clever humor.\n\nMiles Morales is a little bit older (and taller) than when we last saw him, but he’s having a rough time now that he’s hardly seen Gwen Stacy and the rest of his Spider-People crew. A new villain enters the picture, majorly upping the stakes for Miles and the fate of the whole Spider-Verse. We also meet a handful of new characters voiced by some truly delightful actors, like Issa Rae’s badass pregnant Spider-Woman, Oscar Issac as Spider-Man 2099, Daniel Kaluuya’s rocker Spider-Punk, and Karan Soni as Spider-Man India. While the sequel clocks in at two hours, every minute is bursting with entertainment. — Oliver Whitney, Contributing Writer\n\nHow to watch: Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse is now streaming on Netflix.\n\n2. Leon: The Professional\n\nLong before she was kicking butt in the Star Wars prequels or the MCU, Natalie Portman played Mathilda, a precocious young girl who befriends a hitman in Leon: The Professional. Directed by Luc Besson, what might have been another '90s action flick splashed with blood and a preposterous plotline has an unexpected sweetness. This was thanks in no small part to French actor Jean Reno, who plays the titular assassin with an enchanting gentleness.\n\nWhen a corrupt DEA agent (Gary Oldman, in feral mode) kills Mathilda's entire family, it's up to Leon to use both his soft side and his killer instinct to shield her and take down her enemies. This seminal thriller explodes with tension, action, character, and Oldman's unforgettable delivery of \"EV-REE-ONE!\" — K.P.\n\nHow to watch: Leon: The Professional is now streaming on Netflix.\n\n1. Godzilla Minus One\n\nYou don't know Godzilla until you see Godzilla Minus One. The American movies featuring the classic kaiju go for huge monster-versus-monster face-offs, bogged down by tedious human characters. But writer/director Takashi Yamazaki reclaims the Japanese icon with a movie that gets the balance between rampaging monster action and human drama just right.\n\nSet near the close of World War II, Godzilla Minus One proves a fascinating tale of atomic age terror. Ryunosuke Kamiki stars as a kamikaze pilot who first flubs his mission, then crosses paths with the giant lizard with atomic breath. Survivor's guilt torments him, even as he cobbles together a found family of fellow survivors. This cast of characters is dynamic, making the scenes of simple home-cooked meals just as satisfying as sequences of town-trampling destruction. Actually, one deeply informs the other. Because while the movie's jaw-dropping special effects rightfully won the Academy Award for Best Visual Effects, it's the emotional impact of them that makes this Godzilla hit harder than any contemporary. Even on the small screen, you'll be in awe.* — K.P.\n\nHow to watch: Godzilla Minus One is streaming on Netflix.\n\n* denotes the entry comes from a previous Mashable list.\n\nUPDATE: Jul. 3, 2024, 4:00 p.m. EDT This post has been updated to reflect the current selection on Netflix."
