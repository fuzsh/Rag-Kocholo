        "text": "Punisher: War Zone is the third feature film adaptation of the Marvel Comics character Frank Castle, aka \"The Punisher\". The 2008 action film features Ray Stevenson as Castle, who does battle with a disfigured mob enforcer known as Jigsaw. This film follows two other adaptations: a 1989 film starring Dolph Lundgren and a 2004 version starring Thomas Jane, although it is a sequel to neither. The Punisher would return beginning in 2016 with Jon Bernthal in the role in the MCU Netflix series Daredevil and then in his own 2017 standalone series.\n\nThe following weapons were used in the film Punisher: War Zone:\n\nHandguns\n\nBeretta 92FS Inox (converted to full auto)\n\nFrank Castle aka The Punisher (Ray Stevenson) carries two stainless Beretta 92FS Inox pistols with extended magazines in tactical holsters throughout the whole film. He most notably uses them in the beginning shootout. Microchip (Wayne Knight) is also seen handing Castle a couple of Berettas after Castle decides to go after Jigsaw (Dominic West). The Berettas in the film have been converted to fire full-auto. In the Punisher comics, contrary to this film, Castle's favorite firearm is the M1911A1, specifically Springfield Armory ones.\n\nBeretta 92SB\n\nBilly Russotti's aka Jigsaw's thug Pittsy (Mark Camacho) carries a Beretta 92SB fitted with pearl grips as his sidearm, and uses it a couple of times in the film. FBI Special Agent Budianski (Colin Salmon) also takes Pittsy's Beretta during the Donatelli kidnapping. A Beretta 92SB is also seen in one of Tiberiu Bulat's (Aubert Pallascio) Russian thug's gun packs, during the \"Punisher party\" near the end of the film.\n\nBeretta 9000S\n\nAngela Donatelli (Julie Benz) briefly wields a Beretta 9000S when Castle comes to see the Donatellis.\n\nColt M1911A1\n\nThe Colt M1911A1 is the pistol of choice for the Punisher in the comics, though in the film, the only time he touches one is when he is seen disassembling and cleaning an M1911A1 in the beginning. A Irish mobster is also briefly seen with an M1911A1 when Jigsaw and LBJ are \"recruiting\". A gangbanger is also seen with a couple of M1911A1s during the hotel shootout.\n\nGlock 17\n\nGlock 17 appears to be the sidearm of NYPD officers and detectives in the film, including Officer Saffiotti (Tony Calabretta) and Martin Soap (Dash Mihok). FBI Special Agent Budianski (Colin Salmon) also carries a Glock 17 as his sidearm.\n\nHeckler & Koch USP Compact Tactical\n\nFrank Castle (Ray Stevenson) uses a Heckler & Koch USP Compact Tactical with a spurred hammer as a back-up for his Berettas during the first half of the film, kept in a tactical tight-holster. Castle most notably uses it during the mansion and recycling warehouse shootouts. Micro's ex-gangbanger friend Carlos (Carlos Gonzalez-Vio) also purchases another one of these pistols from an acquaintance (as part of Microchip's unofficial \"buy-back\" program). Castle then holds the USP on Carlos' throat in Micro's apartment.\n\nMakarov PM\n\nDuring the meeting with Jigsaw, one of Cristu Bulat's (David Vadim) bodyguards draws a Makarov PM.\n\nRuger KP94\n\nBilly Russotti aka \"Jigsaw\" (Dominic West) keeps a pair of Ruger KP94s as his sidearms. He most notably uses them during the climax. Billy also gives one to his brother Loony Bin Jim (Doug Hutchison).\n\nEAA Witness\n\nJames Russotti, aka Loony Bin Jim (Doug Hutchison) carries a pair of nickel plated EAA Witnesses as his sidearms. He apparently loses them after he's apprehended, because during the climax he is seen using one of Billy's Ruger KP94s.\n\nAMC Auto Mag Pistol\n\nCarlos (Carlos Gonzalez-Vio) purchases a AMC Auto Mag Pistol, among other handguns, from a fellow gangbanger before carrying them back to Microchip. The gun seems to be a rib-less version of the .44 Automag.\n\nSIG-Sauer P230\n\nPittsy's son, Ink (Keram Malicki-Sanchez) carries a SIG-Sauer P230 as his sidearm throughout the film. He most notably uses it at the recycling warehouse to shoot at Castle. He also pulls it on Christu Bulat's bodyguard during the meeting.\n\nSmith & Wesson Model 500\n\nFrank Castle (Ray Stevenson) uses two Smith & Wesson Model 500 revolvers during the course of film. The first one he uses is a plain version with an extended ejector shroud. Halfway through the film, Castle switches his USP Compact Tactical to the plain Model 500, and carries it in the tactical leg holster. He is most notably seen using it when he is looking for Micro in his apartment. The other Smith & Wesson Model 500 Castle carries is a Smith & Wesson Performance Center version of the gun. It has a Knight's Armament RIS setup, sights, a tactical flashlight, a laser, and a black suppressor installed. He uses the second Model 500 most notably during the climax, also carrying it in the tactical thigh holster. During the final confrontation Jigsaw (Dominic West) relieves Frank of the weapon, and empties three of the four remaining rounds into Frank's bulletproof vest, then tosses the weapon back to him to \"decide\" how to use the last one. Frank also uses it at the end to save Soap from a mugger.\n\nA couple of gangbangers are also seen with plain, short-barreled Smith & Wesson Model 500 revolvers during the hotel shootout.\n\nSmith & Wesson Model 640 Centennial\n\nSpecial Agent Budianski (Colin Salmon) carries a Smith & Wesson Model 640 Centennial as his back-up gun. He is briefly seen pulling it on Castle in an alley, but Castle turns the tables and disarms Budianski of his gun.\n\nSmith & Wesson 39\n\nFrank Castle (Ray Stevenson) pulls out a Smith & Wesson 39 from Nicky's (Romano Orzari) jacket, when his Berettas and his USP run out of ammo. It is never seen again, though.\n\nWalther P22\n\nFrank Castle has an Umarex \"Walther P22 S\", a blank firing replica of the Walther P22, hanging on the wall in his armory.\n\nWalther P99\n\nA triad is seen firing a pair of two-tone Walther P99s akimbo during the hotel shootout.\n\nA mob henchman is also briefly seen holding a plain Walther P99 during the mansion shootout.\n\nRuger Super Redhawk\n\nA gangbanger is briefly seen with a scoped Ruger Super Redhawk during the hotel shootout.\n\nSmith & Wesson 5904\n\nOne of the criminals Jigsaw and Looney Bin Jim recruit is briefly seen holding an early model Smith & Wesson 5904 during the hotel shootout.\n\nSmith & Wesson Model 19\n\nA gangbanger is briefly seen firing a Smith & Wesson Model 19 at Castle.\n\nSmith & Wesson Model 686\n\nA gangbanger is seen with a Smith & Wesson Model 686 just before the hotel shootout.\n\nDesert Eagle\n\nA gangbanger is very briefly seen holding a Desert Eagle during the hotel shootout.\n\nSmith & Wesson Model 442 Centennial\n\nA mob guard during the mansion shootout in the beginning is briefly seen with a Smith & Wesson Model 442 Centennial revolver.\n\nUnknown snub-nosed revolver\n\nNear the end of the film, an anonymous mugger (Jean-Loup Yale) points an unknown revolver at Det. Martin Soap, demanding his wallet.\n\nSubmachine Guns\n\nBrügger & Thomet MP-9\n\nDuring the mansion gunfight in the beginning, a thug is seen armed with a Brügger & Thomet MP-9.\n\nHeckler & Koch MP5K\n\nFrank Castle (Ray Stevenson) carries a pair of custom Heckler & Koch MP5Ks in back holsters. The MP5Ks have satin nickel receivers, and the guns have had their foregrips removed, making them true \"machine pistols\", they also have rails added to the top of them and, bizarrely, seem to have M16A4/M4A1-like rear sight sections mounted on them (see images below). Castle uses these custom guns during the shootout in the beginning. When the guns run dry, he dumps them, and we don't see them again.\n\nSeveral Chines Triads are also seen using plain MP5Ks during the hotel shootout.\n\nHeckler & Koch MP5A3\n\nA couple of Heckler & Koch MP5A3s are seen during the mansion shootout. Most of them seem to be rubber props, though. Some of the henchmen in Billy Russotti's (Dominic West) recycling warehouse also carry Heckler & Koch MP5A3s. A couple of triads are also seen with MP5A3s during the hotel shootout.\n\nHeckler & Koch MP5A2\n\nAn FBI agent is briefly seen armed with a Heckler & Koch MP5A2 during the arrest of Christu Bulat after his meeting with Jigsaw at the harbor.\n\nHeckler & Koch MP5SD\n\nOne of the FBI Agents with Agent Ross during his meeting with Jigsaw carries a Heckler & Koch MP5SD.\n\nIMI Uzi\n\nSeveral criminals use the IMI Uzi during the hotel shootout. One is also seen being loaded by a criminal just before the hotel shootout.\n\nSmith & Wesson 76\n\nSeveral criminals are seen armed with Smith & Wesson 76 sub-machine guns during the hotel shootout.\n\nCZ Vz.61 Skorpion\n\nA CZ Vz.61 Skorpion is briefly seen being unpacked by a Russian henchman just before the hotel shootout near the end. It is later seen in the hands of a Russian, who uses it until he dies.\n\nRifles\n\nM4A1 Carbine\n\nFrank Castle (Ray Stevenson) has a custom short-barreled M4A1-type carbine in his armory, which he uses most notably during the hotel shootout. The carbine is equipped with KAC Quad-rails, a C-More red dot optic sight, a DoubleStar single picatinny rail AR-15 gas block, an Advanced Armament Corp M4-2000 suppressor, and a short-barreled AG-C grenade launcher. The grenade launcher is actually a Madbull AGX airsoft prop. The rifle is referred to by the Armorer on the behind-the-scenes feature as an M4 with a short barrel. Note: It is NOT a Heckler & Koch HK416 as some have speculated. A couple of FBI agents are seen armed with M4A1 carbines during the arrest of Christu Bulat after the meeting with Jigsaw.\n\nHeckler & Koch SL8-4\n\nFrank Castle (Ray Stevenson) uses a Heckler & Koch SL8-4 to snipe one of the members of Maginty's gang between the eyes, then to kneecap Maginty himself.\n\nHeckler & Koch G3A3\n\nThe Chinese Triads set out a Heckler & Koch G3 battle rifle before the final hotel shootout, although we never see them use the rifle.\n\nHeckler & Koch G36C\n\nSeveral Chinese Triads use Heckler & Koch G36C rifles during the final shootout.\n\nHeckler & Koch G36K\n\nThe Chinese Triads set out and use Heckler & Koch G36K rifles before and during the final shootout. One is also seen in Frank Castle's hideout.\n\nBeretta CX4 Storm\n\nDuring the hotel shootout near the end of the film, a couple of the Chinese Triads are seen armed with Beretta Cx4 Storms.\n\nSIG SG 552\n\nSeveral FBI agents are armed with SIG SG 552 rifles during the arrest of Christu Bulat.\n\nZastava M70\n\nDuring the mansion shootout in the beginning, a couple of gangsters are seen armed with fixed stock Zastava M70B1s, the Yugoslavian variant of the AK-47. The rifles used by the mansion guards in the beginning seem to be fitted with AK-74 flash hiders.\n\nSeveral of the Russians working for Tiberiu are seen armed with folding stock Zastava M70AB2s during the hotel shootout.\n\nAKS-74U\n\nSeveral of Tiberiu's Russian thugs carry AKS-74U carbines during the final shootout.\n\nRuger Mini-14\n\nA gangbanger is briefly seen fiddling with the cocking handle of his Ruger Mini-14 with synthetic stock when preparing for the \"Punisher party\".\n\nL1A1\n\nA gangbanger is briefly seen handing out an L1A1 when they are preparing to fight the Punisher, just before the hotel shootout.\n\nShotguns\n\nFranchi PA3\n\nWhen Jigsaw (Dominic West) and Loony Bin Jim (Doug Hutchison) visit the Donatellis, Ink (Keram Malicki-Sanchez) carries a Franchi PA3 shotgun. Jigsaw later uses it to threaten the Donatellis and force Agent Budianski (Colin Salmon) to surrender his gun.\n\n12 Gauge Double-Barreled Sawed-Off Shotgun\n\nA gangbanger is briefly seen wielding a 12 Gauge Double-Barreled Sawed-Off Shotgun briefly before the \"Punisher party\".\n\nWinchester Model 1300\n\nA gangbanger is seen holding a Winchester Model 1300 Defender shotgun when preparing to fight the Punisher.\n\nOther\n\nMadbull AGX Grenade Launcher\n\nFrank Castle (Ray Stevenson) has a shortened version of the Heckler & Koch AG-C grenade launcher attached on his rifle, perhaps to make it lighter and handier in close quarters. He most notably uses it during the hotel shootout near the end to dispatch a group of gangbangers. The launcher fires some kind of air burst grenade, which explodes in mid-air. Prop wise, this is an airsoft launcher called the Madbull AGX.\n\nCobray CM79LF 37mm Launcher\n\nMidway through the film, Frank Castle uses a stand alone Cobray 37mm Launcher to dispatch one of Maginty's (T. J. Storm) parkour crew. Strangely, the effects make the weapon seem like a guided missile launcher.\n\nM4X Knife\n\nFrank's combat/utility knife is used to perform one of his first kills of the movie, nearly decapitating mob boss Gaetano Cesare, before being plunged into the crown of another dining mafioso's skull.\n\nVarious\n\nAssorted handguns\n\nSeveral gangbangers are seen with assorted handguns during the \"recruiting\" montage. Also during the hotel shootout some gangbangers are seen with various handguns, which are too hard to identify.\n\nCastle's Armory\n\nFrank Castle has an extensive armory, which I'm separating from the rest of the gun entries. The following is a list of guns in Frank Castle's armory\n\nGuns in this image:\n\na Heckler & Koch USP Compact Tactical Note the thread protector on the barrel\n\nvarious gun parts\n\nMicro's armory\n\nIn addition to Frank Castle's extensive armory seen during the course of the film, Microchip (Wayne Knight) also possesses a collection of firearms in his apartment.\n\nIn this image above:\n\nA british Enfield L85 rifle"
