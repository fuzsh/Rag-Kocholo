        "text": "Punisher: War Zone is a 2008 action thriller film based on the Marvel Comics character the Punisher, directed by Lexi Alexander. Rather than a sequel to 2004's The Punisher, the film is a reboot that follows the war waged by vigilante Frank Castle / Punisher (Ray Stevenson) on crime and corruption, in particular on the disfigured mob boss known as Billy \"Jigsaw\" Russotti (Dominic West), It is the third feature film adaptation of The Punisher, the second reboot thereof and one of two films to be produced under the Marvel Knights production banner, which focuses on films for mature audiences. Punisher: War Zone was released in North America by Lionsgate on December 5, 2008, and it was released in the United Kingdom by Sony Pictures Releasing International on February 6, 2009 to negative reviews and grossed $10 million worldwide making it a box office bomb. Its related soundtrack hit the #23 slot on Billboard's Top Independent Albums chart.\n\nIt was the final Punisher film to be produced by an outside studio before the rights reverted to Marvel Studios, with Stevenson reprising his role as Castle in The Super Hero Squad Show. A television series was later released on Netflix in 2017 and is set in the Marvel Cinematic Universe.\n\nCast[]\n\nName Dubber Frank Castle / Punisher Ray Stevenson Billy Russoti / Jigsaw Dominic West James Russoti Loony Bin Jim Doug Hutchison Paul Budiansky Colin Salmon Linus Lieberman / Microchip Wayne Knight Martin Soap Dash Mihok Angela Donatelli Julie Benz Grace Donatelli Stephanie Janusauskas Carmine \"Pittsy\" Gazzera Mark Camacho FBI Agent Nicky Donatelli Romano Orzari \"Ink\" Gazzera Keram Malicki SÃ¡nchez Agent Miller Larry Day Captain Ross Ron Lea Saffioti Tony Calabretta Maginty T.J.
