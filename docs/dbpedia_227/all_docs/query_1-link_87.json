        "text": "Every modern war has inspired its share of great movies. Some of those movies involve journalists, whether for explanatory purposes, or drama, or comic relief. And why not? Correspondents stand in for ordinary citizens, bearing witness to war and being changed by it. Depending on the director's vision, their characters can be used lionize the troops, or humanize the war, or lament the whole bloody fiasco. The reporters themselves can be portrayed as heroes or cowards, visionaries or dupes. They can be terrified, and they can do hilarious things to relieve the tension. The new Tina Fey movie, 'Whiskey Tango Foxtrot,' stands on its own merits, but also stands as the most recent in a long line of cinematic treatments of war and the men and women who cover it.\n\nWar, journalism, and the movies\n\nForeign Correspondent: intrigue at the onset of World War II (1940)\n\nJoel MCrea plays a reporter named Johnny Jones, who's given a fancy new name (Huntley Haverstock) by his editor and sent to Europe as a foreign correspondent. He doesn't mean to be a war correspondent; he's covering a peace conference. But then he sees an assassination and trips over a ring of fascist spies. Will he live long enough to file his story?\n\nThe Story of GI Joe: celebrating a writer who lived and died with the troops (1945)\n\n'The Story of GI Joe' actually tells the story of Ernie Pyle, the newspaperman who delighted in writing minature portraits of the extraordinary things done by ordinary soldiers. Pyle never got to see the final version of the movie. He died during the fight for Okinawa.\n\nThe Year Of Living Dangerously: critical relationships and dangerous choices (1982)\n\nMel Gibson plays Guy Hamilton, a reporter on his first foreign assignment. Initially, he’s not covering a war. He’s trying to figure out what’s going on around him. Just as he does so, with the help of a British diplomat (Sigourney Weaver) and a local fixer (Linda Hunt), a Communist insurgency breaks out. Smart foreigners flee to the airport. Hamilton stays, more than long enough to understand how horrifying life in Jakarta has become. The movie deftly portrays the vital role played by local staff members in dangerous countries, but must have disappointed hundreds of journalists over the years who, try as they might, never got to have that affair with the gorgeous diplomat. But at least in this war, journalists weren't targeted for assassination.\n\nUnder Fire: lethal violence and hard choices in the dying days of the Somoza regime in Nicaragua (1983)\n\nIn real life, in 1979, agents of the Somoza regime in Nicaragua murdered ABC reporter Bill Stewart and his translator, Juan Espinoza. Their deaths were caught on tape, and broadcast in the United States. That inspired the Carter Administration to abandon the Somoza dictatorship. It also inspired the heavily fictional 'Under Fire,' in which Nick Nolte plays a veteran war photographer. For the audience, one big question is whether his sins against the normal standards of journalism are justified by the extraordinary conditions in Nicaragua.\n\nThe Killing Fields: surviving the Khmer Rouge, and celebrating the bond between reporter and translator (1984)\n\nThe big thing this film gets right is the bravery and indispensability of the local translators and fixers who help American correspondents -- in this case, Sydney Schanberg of The New York Times -- survive in foreign countries, and understand what's happening before their eyes. They take greater risks than the reporters do, and for far smaller rewards. Sam Waterston plays Schanberg. Dr. Haing S. Ngor plays his translator, Dith Pran, who is left behind after the fall of Cambodia to survive the terror of the Khmer Rouge.\n\nSalvador: love, death, and the obsessive photographer (1986)\n\nIt's an Oliver Stone movie, so it sends many signals about the perfidy of right-wing Salvadorans and the complicity of American diplomats in the 12-year war with leftist insurgents that turned El Salvador into a slaughterhouse. But the most powerful aspect of the film is the engrossing mix of ego and self-sacrifice, love and egotism, cynicism and honor, that James Wood brings to the character of a photographer named Richard Boyle. It also offers one of the truest quotations ever about war coverage: \"You gotta get close to get the truth. You get too close, you die.\" And the part where the journalist loses his heart to the people he's writing about? That happens in real life.\n\nFull Metal Jacket: seeing the horrors of Vietnam through the eyes of a Marine journalist (1987)\n\nIn a twist of the military-vs-journalist plot, the journalist here, played by Matthew Modine, is also a Marine. The film starts with his harsh introduction to the Corps at boot camp, and ends with the brutal battle for Hue. There, after watching one of his best friends die, he’s forced to put down his camera and use his rifle, crossing the one-way bridge from innocence to awareness. Civilian journalists appear only briefly, as an absurd side show to the war.\n\nWelcome to Sarajevo: weaving together truth and fiction, staged deaths and real ones (1997)\n\nThis movie is based partly on the very true story of a British correspondent, Michael Nicholson, who met a desperate young girl in Bosnia, adopted her, and got her out of the country. It also nicely captures the incredulousness of journalists who witnessed the carnage, and watched international officials try to dance away from any real responsibility for reducing it. A senior United Nations leader tells journalists the Bosnian war ranks only 14th among the world's sites of suffering. An American reporter, played by Woody Harrelson, treats that proclamation like a ranking of Top 40 hits, and lightly asks whether Sarajevo is moving up or down on the list. Somewhat jarringly, the film mixes actual news footage of real deaths with scenes of fiction.\n\nLive from Baghdad: reporting the first Gulf War from Saddam's capital (2002)\n\nThis made-for-TV movie tells the story of the CNN crew that stayed in Baghdad for the first Gulf war, knowing that American bombs were sure to fall nearby. The fear, the bravery, the humor, the profanity, the ambition and the ethical dilemmas are all there, and so is some of the gritty work of managing logistics and technology. Michael Keaton, who seems to specialize in portraying journalists, ably impersonates a senior CNN producer. So does Helena Bonham Carter.\n\nRestrepo: a pure and shockingly powerful documentary\n\nThis documentary is as pure and piercing as cold mountain air and, like the Afghan war it depicts, it mixes periods of boredom with moments of shocking violence and shattering sorrow.\n\nGeneration Kill: HBO brings humanity to the second Gulf war.\n\nHBO mixed fact and art for this seven-part miniseries, which follows the First Marine Recon Battalion as it invades Iraq at the start of the second Gulf War. The series is based on a book of the same title by Evan Wright, who covered the 2003 war for Rolling Stone. It offers plenty of drama, but the heart of it is illuminating the characters of the men with whom he spent the war. If this was a new generation of Marines, then Wright is his generation's Ernie Pyle."
