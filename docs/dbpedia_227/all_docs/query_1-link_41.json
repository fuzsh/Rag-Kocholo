        "text": "British actor Ray Winstone most recently starred in Darren Aronofsky’s smash hit epic film “Noah”. Ray plays Noah’s nemesis ‘Tubal Cain’, opposite Russell Crowe, Emma Watson, Anthony Hopkins, Jennifer Connelly and Douglas Booth. Later this year, Ray will be seen starring in upcoming action thriller “The Gunman”, directed by Pierre Morel and based on a Jean-Patrick Manchette novel. The film stars Sean Penn, Javier Bardem, Idris Elba and Mark Rylance. Ray was born in Hackney in the East End of London. He studied acting at the Corona School before being cast by director Alan Clarke as Carlin (“the Daddy”) in “Scum”. This BBC Play production made Winstone’s name and since then he has appeared in numerous TV series and movies. After playing a starring role in Franc Roddam’s “Quadrophenia” and being cast by Ken Loach in “Ladybird, Ladybird,” Gary Oldman gave Winstone the lead role in his gritty biographical drama, “Nil By Mouth”, for which he won a British Independent Film Award for Best Actor and earned a BAFTA Award nomination. His mesmerising performance lead to a succession of challenging roles including Dave in the gangster movie “Face” and Dad in Tim Roth’s disturbing drama, “The War Zone.” He also played in the comedy drama “The Mammy” and “Fanny & Elvis” before delivering one of the finest performances of his career opposite Ben Kingsley in “Sexy Beast.” TV credits include “Henry VIII” (which went on to win Best Mini Series/TV Movie at the International Emmy Awards), “Sweeney Todd” and “Compulsion” both films for television for his company Size 9 Productions and “Vincent” for which Ray won an International Emmy Award for Best Actor for his eponymous role. Ray’s most recent television credit was playing Magwitch in BBC’s “Great Expectations”. Other film credits include “Cold Mountain”, “King Arthur”, “The Proposition”, Oscar winner “The Departed” directed by Martin Scorcese, Anthony Minghella’s “Breaking and Entering”, the title role in the Robert Zemeckis film “Beowulf” and Steven Spielberg’s “Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull”. Most recent projects include “44 Inch Chest” for director Malcolm Venville, “London Boulevard” and “Edge of Darkness” both for GK Films, the newly released “Snow White and The Hunstman” opposite Charlize Theron and “The Sweeney” for Vertigo Films. In December 2007, Ray received the Richard Harris Award for outstanding contribution at the British Independent Film Awards.\n\nMarketing Permissions\n\nBritish Independent Film Awards will use the information you provide on this form to be in touch with you and to provide updates.
