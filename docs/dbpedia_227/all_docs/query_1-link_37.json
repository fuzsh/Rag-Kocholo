        "text": "Hi, Edward.\n\nI didn't get the impression at all that either Tom or Jessie were going to commit suicide, much less start having sex with each other.\n\nBack on the old IMDB, there was speculation that, given the level of abuse that Jessie had suffered, and considering that Tom was only trying to prevent it from continuing, that Tom, still a minor as he was under 18, would've been treated relatively leniently by the criminal justice system, while Jessie would've been put in counseling (perhaps in an inpatient facility at first, since she could be considered an accessory to what Tom did to their father). I tend to agree with this.\n\nA few years in the British equivalent of juvenile detention for Tom, with mandatory counseling for both him and Jessie. Remember also that their mother was enraged when she found out what their father (her husband) had been up to, and this could help them at trial (I also got the impression that she suspected her husband of these things for some time, which could point to her possible negligence, which could also help her children at trial).\n\nAs for Tom and Jessie's feelings for each other? I just didn't get the vibe that they were or desired to be incestuous. Opposite-sex siblings can be quite affectionate with each other, without it indicating any kind of sexual desire.\n\nThese opinions are just my own; you are free to have your own:)\n\nThank you Mr Northcoast; , maybe I'm wrong but I got that impression by looking at they way they stared at each other, https://static.rogerebert.com/uploads/review/primary_image/reviews/the-war-zone-2000/hero_EB20000114REVIEWS1140302AR.jpg subtle sexual; innuendos and sex-charged dialogues, no sister would tell her brother that she wanks off in the loo just to battle an interminable ennui, or be bare breasted in front of him like being a normal situation,although Tom seems comfortable with her casual nudity, besides why did she stop her friend from having sex with Tom? These situations could pass inadvertently or taken lightly without any other intention in a different scenario, not in this movie the way they are rolled, besides I also read that in the book they 'do it'. Very disturbing film indeed with very dark matter, in the legal context about the aftermath of the crime I agree and like your analysis. Thank you again for your response. Ed"
