        "text": "The show features rich people lying to poor people and then giving them money, and it's now up on Hulu. All you need to see are the first 11 minutes. Watch Chahal give a tour of his $6.9 million nouveau gauche monstrosity of a penthouse, and fumble around trying to buy groceries. \"Buying groceries, it's not that easy,\" he says. For Yahoo shareholders, watching him give away tiny portions of his fortune will be far too painful. As deserving as the recipients are, they'll wish Chahal was handing their money back to them.\n\nBehavioral targeting is all the rage in online advertising. The technology aims to show ads to Internet users based on the sites they visit and the actions they perform, rather than targeting words they search for, as Google does, or matching advertisers' desired demographics to a site's audience, as most banner-ad purchasers do today. ValueClick has introduced its own product, in competition with AOL's Tacoda and Yahoo's BlueLithium. But ValueClick's executives may not be particularly confident in the product — if rumors are true that they're talking to startup Revenue Science about an acquisition. Revenue Science has raised more than $70 million in venture capital, and recently appointed former ValueClick executive Jeff Hirsch as its CEO.\n\nNow we know why BlueLithium founder and short-time Yahoo employee Gurbaksh \"G\" Chahal decorated his $6.9 million penthouse with tacky animal skins and a cheap-looking chandelier. To look rich for middle America. Chalal is starring in a Fox \"reality\" show this fall called The Secret Millionaire. In it, G will live among poor people and pretend to be one of them. But before doing that, he'll have to convince Fox's audience at home he's used to living a fabulously wealthy lifestyle. Hence, the decorations, G's decorator tells us in an email defending his efforts.\n\nSpotted at the opening of overpriced-denim boutique Duke et Duchess in San Francisco's Hayes Valley neighborhood: Gurbaksh \"G\" Chahal, the megalomaniacal playboy founder of BlueLithium, who's been spending his take from Yahoo's $300 million acquisition of that company on trying to launch an acting career. He's been \"working on his instrument,\" as they say in L.A., for sure — with that outfit, you can hardly avoid checking out his pecs and quads, even if you avert your eyes. Wonder who his trainer is. (Photo by SFLuxe)\n\n\"Many try to exude confidence through arrogance,\" BlueLithium founder Gurbaksh Chahal — known as \"G\" in his press kit — writes on his blog. \"I consider myself very confident but at the same time grounded enough to never be arrogant.\" To illustrate G's humility, G then offers this parable from the life of G, who made millions from the $300 million sale of BlueLithium to Yahoo:\n\nWhen we heard that BlueLithium founder Gurbaksh Chahal bought a $6.9 million penthouse, we figured he'd go with something tastefully modern to match the building and his taste in slim suits and slimmer ties. But no, oh no. Think animal skins; a headboard and coffee table monogrammed with his signature \"G;\" and actual chintz upholstery on the dining room set, which a cheap-looking but showy chandelier hovers over. It's like a pileup on the midcentury-minimalism and rococo-inspired Gucci decadence highway.\n\nEveryone's favorite topless egoist Gurbaksh \"G\" Chahal has a new startup and an agent at William Morris who has landed him a television appearance and a book deal (which, not surprisingly, is about him). But what of his older brother, Taj Chahal, the former VP of operations at ad network BlueLithium which was sold to Yahoo for $300 million? He's wasting his time, and his money, feeding the homeless at Martha's Kitchen in San Jose. He spent $8,000 catering a meal for local homeless on his birthday, and is pictured here pouring drinks for one of the approximately 300 who came to eat. So who, exactly, is the most eligible of the two Chahal brothers, both bachelor millionaires? Your move, G.\n\nIn its April 2008 issue, Entrepreneur caught the immodest-to-a-fault Gurbaksh Chahal in a self-promoting mood — not hard to do — when it asked him how he sold ad-targeting startup BlueLithium to Yahoo for $300 million. \"G\" — as Chalal calls himself — responded with a tale from the life of Oprah:\n\nBlueLithium founder Gurbaksh Chahal, who flipped his online-advertising startup to Yahoo for $300 million, recently purchased a penthouse suite at the Infinity on Rincon Hill for $6.9 million according to the San Francisco Business Times. I'm not exactly sure who SF Luxe's Damion Matthews is proclaiming confirmed bachelor Chahal most eligible for — my head is starting to hurt trying to parse exactly what Matthews means by \"ladies.\" Can't get enough of the adorable egoist? His recently released self-promotional YouTube video after the jump.\n\nGurbaksh Chahal, the egomaniacal entrepreneur who sold ad startup BlueLithium to Yahoo for $300 million in cash, has been pumping up his acting career. And his body. A new shirtless picture is up on his site. We hear that's the result of training with Tom Austin, a San Jose-based bodybuilder who's appeared in gay porn videos such as \"Minute Man 24\" (NSFW, or for men uncomfortable in their heterosexuality) as Bo Dixon. (Some suggest Austin offers other services as well.) Good work, Gurbaksh! Which raises a question:\n\nMeet BlueLithium founder and Yahoo employee Gurbaksh Chahal, \"more commonly known as 'G,'\" according to his personal site. \"At 25 years old,\" the site also reports, \"[G] is one of the youngest and most successful entrepreneurs of recent history.\" But more than that, he is beautiful. After the jump, both G's recent appearances on Fox Business News — and how his publicist announced them.\n\nNick Douglas described MingleNow, ad network BlueLithium's answer to MySpace, as \" Yelp meets Cheers.\" A more accurate description, I suspect, was \"excuse for a bunch of San Jose nerds to fly around the world for parties.\" The expense-account game is over. Yahoo, which acquired BlueLithium for its ad technology, not its wannabe social network, is shutting MingleNow on January 7, and suggesting users go to the Yahoo-owned Flickr or Upcoming instead. Which, come to think of it, is what BlueLithium's investors probably wish its founders had done in the first place."
