        "text": "Yahoo Inc. increased its ad arsenal today with the announcement of its $300 million acquisition of BlueLithium Inc. The buy comes at a crucial time for Yahoo as it expands its ad firm portfolio in the face of stiff competition from both Google and Microsoft.\n\nThe acquisitions of Right Media and Actionality have already bolstered the search giant's ad offerings this year, so this news comes as little shock to anyone who's been following Yahoo's current trends.\n\nCEO Jerry Yang explained the road map for this deal in the company press release:\n\nThis acquisition will extend our ability to deliver powerful data analytics, advanced targeting and innovative media buying strategies to our customers, who are increasingly looking for these insights. By leveraging BlueLithium's complementary expertise and tools, we will be able to better address the needs of our performance-based display advertisers and enhance the value of our publishers' inventory.\n\nAccording to the fine print, the San Jose, California-based ad firm will become a wholly-owned subsidiary of Yahoo, with CEO Gurbaksh Chahal staying on-board for the duration of the transition. If the deal is given regulatory approval, we can expect to see it reach fruition around fourth quarter 2007.\n\nSee Also:\n\nConfirmed: Yahoo Bolsters Mobile Ad Efforts With Actionality Buy\n\nYahoo!
