        "text": "Here's a biography guaranteed to make you feel like a sloth. Gurbaksh Chahal dropped out of school at 16 to found the online ad network ClickAgents. Two years later, he sold it to ValueClick for $40 million in stock. Once his noncompete ran out, he started BlueLithium, a global online ad network that focuses on behavioral targeting. Last year, Yahoo acquired that business, which then had 175 employees and nine offices, for $300 million.\n\nChahal's parents are Indian immigrants who struggled financially for years, but his family is well taken care of now. Chahal's current net worth is more than $100 million, he says. And he's only 25."
