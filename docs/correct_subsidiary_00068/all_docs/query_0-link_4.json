According to comScore, it is the fifth largest ad network in the US and second largest in the UK with 145 million unique visitors each month.\n\nYahoo! said the acquisition will mean it can offer advertisers customers powerful data analytics, advanced targeting and innovative media buying strategies. For publishers, Yahoo! is offering greater access to advertiser budgets through its sales force and the Right Media Exchange, where BlueLithium will be an active participant.\n\nThe acquisition marks a move by Yahoo! to create a large global online ad network, which will include inventory across Yahoo!’s owned and operated properties, the Yahoo! Publisher Network and the Right Media Exchange.\n\nBlueLithium will become a wholly-owned subsidiary of Yahoo!.BlueLithium CEO Gurbaksh Chahal will remain with the company for an interim period through the integration. The transaction is still subject to customary closing conditions, including regulatory approval, with completion expected in the fourth quarter of 2007."
