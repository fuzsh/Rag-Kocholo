        "text": "Thermal runaway is an unpredictable fire hazard experienced by lithium batteries within energy storage systems. The elevated temperatures of a malfunctioning bat-tery cell often cause adjacent cells to also undergo thermal runaway, creating an extremely dangerous fire and explosion hazard.\n\nFike’s years of testing and collaboration have proven that the various protection methods currently used in these applications such as water and chemical agents may indeed suppress lithium battery fires but they do little to stop the root cause of the fire itself, thermal runaway. This results in battery cells that continue to produce dangerous offgas and may continue to burn and even reignite the explosive atmosphere.\n\nFike Blue has been successfully tested internally at Fike’s Remote Testing Facility in Blue Springs, Missouri, and by third-party testing organisations, including CSA (Canadian Standards Association) in a UL-9540A test.\n\nOmri Tayyara, Director of Mechanical Engineering at Jule, observed CSA’s testing of Fike Blue: “We were astounded by its performance. Fike Blue cooled our internal module temperatures from several hundred degrees celsius to under 100°C and prevented cascading thermal runaway–a true engineering break-through. It was extremely impressive to watch, and the whole thing was done in less than 10 minutes.”\n\nFike Blue facts:\n\nFully submerses the cells and absorbs the intense exothermic heat without breaking down due to a boiling point of more than 400°C.\n\nUses exponentially less liquid than the water required by sprinklers and especially by fire fighters, resulting in far less runoff into the surrounding environment.\n\nDoes not fall under the family of PFAS, many of which are currently under investigation around the world.\n\nIs stored as a pressurised liquid and discharged as a liquid.\n\nIs far less conductive than water and has never shorted the cells.\n\nMay be stored for at least five years at 25°C without formation of precipitates or sediment.\n\nFor more news and technical articles from the global renewable industry, read the latest issue of Energy Global magazine.\n\nEnergy Global's Autumn 2023 issue\n\nThe Autumn 2023 issue of Energy Global hosts an array of technical articles focusing on green hydrogen, wind installation technology, blade monitoring solutions, and more. This issue also features a regional report looking at some key renewables projects in Australia."
