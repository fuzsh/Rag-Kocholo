        "text": "Solid state lithium-ion technology has drawn the interest of a broad range of global original equipment manufacturers. For example, Toyota has been a vocal supporter of solid-state lithium ion batteries and have publicly stated their aim to commercialize them for electric vehicle use by 2022. Toyota is not alone in their pursuit of solid state technology – in 2013, Apple acquired Infinite Power Solutions, a company focused on the development of solid state batteries.\n\n​\n\nMoreover, in 2017, UK-based Dyson announced that it would be investing USD $2.7 billion to bring an electric vehicle with a solid-state battery to market by 2020. However, this timeline has recently been brought into question after a new report indicated Dyson’s first generation of electric vehicles may not feature this technology. Nonetheless, various global startup and growth-stage companies globally are pushing ahead to address the challenges with solid-state lithium-ion battery scale-up, including Massachusetts-based Ionic Materials and Colorado-based Solid Power.\n\nConsidering the significant timescales involved and investment required from bench and pilot scale to commercial production, it is likely that solid-state lithium-ion batteries will find their first applications in specific segments, such as consumer electronics. As the technology matures and economies of scale are reached, it is then likely that larger format applications such as electric vehicles will follow. Benchmarking with the typical timelines for new/revolutionary battery technology commercialization, coupled with a consideration of the specific opportunities and challenges that have to be addressed for solid-state batteries, it is likely that mass market adoption for solid-state lithium-ion batteries is at least 8-10+ years away.\n\nAdvancing Resource Recovery/Recycling Technology and Li-Cycle™\n\nLi-Cycle is on a mission to solve the global lithium-ion battery recycling challenge and meet the rapidly growing demand for critical battery materials. The company seeks to ensure that electric vehicles and lithium-ion batteries have a truly positive environmental impact over their entire life cycle. In turn, Li-Cycle aims to enable the momentum behind the global transition to electro-mobility and reduce greenhouse gas emissions on a global scale.\n\nAs lithium-ion battery technology continues to undergo evolutionary and revolutionary changes to further advance the capabilities of the batteries that power our world, Li-Cycle is strategically positioned to provide an end-of-lifecycle recycling solution to all types of lithium-based batteries. In doing so, Li-Cycle aims to create a true closed-loop system, enabling low cost, environmentally sustainable recycling processes and industry-leading safety standards to support the battery industry as it continues to drive global electrification."
