However, it was quite difficult for them to earn money for supporting the needs of the family.\n\nThe Chahal family always focused on education and made sure that their children received it. Gurbaksh Chahal, right from the beginning, was extremely ambitious. His parents had other dreams for him while he had different plans for himself. At the tender age of 16 years, he decided to let go of schooling in order to try his luck in entrepreneurship. He founded his first company, ClickAgents, when he was just 18 years old.

It’s ideal for exploiting the opportunities hidden in big data. Unlike traditional analysis, Mona Lisa’s machine learning thrives on growing datasets.

Even though there is only a slight change of words, the meaning of the sentence changes entirely.\n\nMarketing with a video:\n\nIn simple terms it means adding a video to your company’s website that promotes a product or service, as a means of direct campaign.\n\nIt is a sales tool used frequently to get subscriber information. The videos can be in the form of a webinar series or it can be attached to an email, which is then used for promotion. The videos are basically used to explain in detail the product specifications and they work easily too.\n\nThe success rate of a product increases when it is marketed with the help of a video on the company’s website.\n\nMarketing a video:\n\nWhen the company wants to create brand awareness, it usually promotes video of the most important person of that company. In most cases, the founder of the company features in the aforementioned videos. In other cases, the CEO of the company is likely to feature in the video.\n\nThe purpose of such videos is to deliver clear and precise information to the viewers without any manipulation.\n\nThese videos are entertaining and informative at the same time and are used as an indirect means of campaigning for the firm’s image and brand name.\n\nYou can find Gurbaksh Chahal Videos on his website and on YouTube, which are extremely motivational and inspiring for the young and competent entrepreneurs.\n\nThe purpose of brand building will not be achieved with just one video. There has to be a series of videos coming up every now and then, say fortnightly or monthly. It is a part of the on-going marketing strategy and should coincide with the channel created on the site, for example, YouTube, which is particularly a video uploading site.\n\nIf the first video appeals to the viewer, he moves to the subsequent video in the series published. This creates a chain reaction and so, there needs to be a sufficient amount of creative video series to grab the viewer’s attention for a longer duration.\n\nIn either case, marketing a video or marketing through a video, the company does not have to forego advertising through clichéd means like its website and YouTube. The company can always use other video uploading sites to make their videos popular among the masses.\n\nUsage of social media sites:\n\nAs a part of the social media campaign, the company should try to promote their videos with the bloggers and create a buzz. The likelihood of the videos being tweeted and re-tweeted will increase.\n\nTracking and monitoring of the number of views across the globe, are important along with the aforementioned tips. For this, a tool can be used which keeps a track of all the visits on all the platforms used by the company for promotion.‘TubeMogul’ is one such tool which can be used to track all the views at one place.\n\nHence, it can be rightly concluded that video marketing can be used as an effective medium of reaching out to a larger audience in the hopes of advertising a company’s product or service and increasing the brand value of that company.\n\nG4 is a global multinational holding company. It has various subsidiaries that operate within the energy, natural resources, marketing, software and digital media sectors.

It is a cloud platform for global marketing. It uses data science and machine learning to install marketing tactics for the brands.\n\nThe Gravity4 CEO, Chahal also ventured two more creations G4 Natural Resources and G4 Pharma to further diversify his cosmopolitan to its main focus on making the world a better place and aims at providing safe and economical energy resources and pharmaceuticals.\n\nHe bought all these entities together to ensure that the companies were working together and named the collaboration as G4 holdings worldwide popularly called “G4 Worldwide”.\n\nEach brand of it is an example of their philosophy of global excellence.\n\nIt also has “The Chahal foundation” as one of its subsidiaries which is a non-profitable organization formed under section 501 ©3.

This is the ever-evolving spirit of G4 Worldwide.\n\nThrough all the branches of it, they try to improve the quality of life through innovation and by pushing the growth of those sectors. Like for instance the G4 Pharmaceuticals aims at providing quality and affordable medicines across the globe. “We don’t believe in making dollars. We believe in the value of saving lives.” Their mission is to provide better products for a healthy life.\n\nThe G4 Natural Resources aim at supplying economical resources to the industrial customers globally.
