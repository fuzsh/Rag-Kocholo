        "text": "April 9 news, Azure Lithium Core released its first quarter 2021 results forecast, the first quarter net profit is expected to reach 150 million-165 million yuan, a year-on-year increase of 1411.44% Rue 1562.59%.\n\nAs for the reasons for the growth in performance, Azure Lithium said that in the first quarter of 2021, the company's business was in good condition, and its overall operating performance maintained a good growth compared with the fourth quarter of 2020; while the first quarter of 2020 was greatly affected by the epidemic, so the performance increased more significantly than the same period last year. During the reporting period, the lithium battery business continued to maintain the good situation of the fourth quarter, and the overall situation was in a state of full production and full sales, which was the biggest source of profit for the company.\n\nAccording to public information: Azure Lithium Core was formerly known as Aoyang Shunchang, and the company changed its name on December 14, 2020. Its business covers three major areas: metal logistics and distribution, LED chips and new energy lithium electricity, and the lithium battery business has become the company's biggest source of profit since 2020.\n\nOn the same day, Azure Lithium Core plans to invest more than 1.2 billion yuan in the lithium battery project, with an estimated investment of 1.256 billion yuan, an additional annual production capacity of 1 billion AH lithium-ion batteries, and an annual production capacity of more than 300 million lithium batteries. After the completion of the project, the wholly-owned subsidiary Tianpeng Power supply will have an annual capacity of 700 million lithium batteries.\n\nOn March 3, 2021, following the 1.256 billion investment, Azure Lithium Core announced that the company signed the \"Qingjiang Pu District Tianpeng Lithium Energy industrialization Project Investment Agreement\" with the people's Government of Qingjiangpu District of Huaian City, Jiangsu Province and the Management Committee of Jiangsu Huaian Qinghe Economic Development Zone. It is proposed to invest in the construction of a high-efficiency new lithium-ion battery industrialization project in Huaian Qinghe Economic Development Zone, with a total investment of 5 billion yuan. Build a new 4 billion AH cylindrical lithium battery industrialization project.\n\nThe total amount of funds raised in this offering does not exceed 1.5 billion yuan, which is intended to be used for the annual production of 1 billion AH high-safety, long-life, high-energy density new lithium-ion battery expansion project and 2 billion AH annual high-efficiency new lithium-ion battery industrialization project after deducting the issue cost. The former has a total investment of 1.256 billion yuan and intends to raise 600 million yuan, with Jiangsu Tianpeng Power supply Co., Ltd., a wholly owned subsidiary of the company, as the main body of the project, while the latter has a total investment of 2.35 billion yuan and intends to raise 900 million yuan. The company or its holding subsidiary will set up a new subsidiary in Huai'an as the main body of the project.\n\nUnder the bombardment of these decisions, Azure Lithium revealed on the interactive platform around March 35 that the company's sales target for this year's lithium battery business is to grow by 70% compared with the same period last year.\n\nFrom this, it is not difficult to see that the blue lithium core is imperative for the lithium battery market. Driven by the environmental protection policy, the new energy vehicle market is in the limelight, and the lithium battery, as the core of the new energy vehicle plate, is naturally the same.\n\nAccording to SMM historical data, the price of lithium metal has been rising all the way since December 21, 2020. as of April 9, the average price of domestic lithium metal was 585000 yuan / ton, up 25.8% from its low on December 21, 2020.\n\n\"Click to view the historical price of SMM Metals.\n\nAs of April 9, according to SMM data, battery-grade lithium carbonate quoted 880000092000 yuan / ton, with an average price of 90000 yuan / ton, the same as yesterday.\n\n\"Click to view the spot market of SMM metal.\n\nAccording to SMM research, the recent lithium iron and lithium manganate manufacturers of lithium carbonate raw materials (quasi-electric carbon and industrial carbon) inventory is relatively ideal, ternary material end raw materials (electric carbon) due to the reduction of partial supply of pyroxene series, superimposed lithium leading effect big factory price control ability is strong, the price is still strong at about 90, 000 yuan / ton. Recently, it was learned that Chile announced on April 1 local time that in response to the sharp increase in the number of cases caused by the coronavirus, the government decided to close the border from April 5 to May 1. Fortunately, SMM survey data show that Chile's border blockade has not affected the export of lithium salt for the time being, and shipments from major manufacturers are relatively smooth, but it does not rule out that it will still be affected by some delays in shipping. According to SMM estimates, Chilean imports of Chinese lithium carbonate account for about 20-25% of the total supply (domestic production + total imports). If the Chilean epidemic continues to heat up, leading to delays in exports, there will be a more obvious gap on the domestic demand side. At present, there are no obvious export obstacles, SMM will continue to track relevant information. \"View details\n\nAs of April 9, the closing price of Azure Lithium Core was 12.33 yuan per share, up 0.33% from yesterday."
