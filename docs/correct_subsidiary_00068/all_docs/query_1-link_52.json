And with great success! Along with 25 classmates from his previous school, Pravin organized campaigns at his home village and encouraged people for voluntary work, all together with the Paani Foundation. They build pits to collect rainwater and planted many about 100 new trees. 🌳 The soil was provided with an aggregate storage capacity of 100 billion liters of water. The results: The groundwater level rose and water deliveries by tanker were no longer necessary. 💦 Are you also committed to the environment? 🌱 #Evonik #Volunteering #DoingGoodTogether #ThereforOthers\n\nCongratulations! 🎖️ On July 15, 1854, the 1st General German Industrial Exhibition opened in Munich at the instigation of King Maximilian II of Bavaria in the \"Glass Palace\", which was built especially for the occasion. 🏫 6,588 exhibitors presented a wide range of products in the Bavarian capital. Among them was Friedrich Ernst Roessler, who was even awarded a prize \"for his flourishing gold and silver separating business\". Roessler's precious metal refinery formed the basis for the founding of Evonik's predecessor Degussa in 1873. The medal from Munich is the first award that the Group has ever received. 👏 #Evonik #EvonikHistory #tbt Image: Munich City Museum (CC BY SA 4.0)\n\nToday is World Emoji Day 🌏 Watch as Frank, Angela, and Verena describe their jobs using only three emojis!

This means less active ingredient is required to achieve the same outcome, which has multiple benefits. For example, patients may experience fewer side effects. And vaccine manufacturers can produce more vaccines with the same amount of API. 🤔 Where’s the problem? Pharma-grade squalene is currently derived from sharks.🦈 But many sharks are endangered species - killing sharks decimates marine ecosystems. 🙌🌿 Good news! There is an alternative. We have developed PhytoSquene® - the first GMP-grade squalene. Made from amaranth oil, this squalene is suitable for pharmaceutical applications. We help you offer safe and effective vaccines while preserving biodiversity! 👉 Learn more about the benefits of PhytoSquene® and what this means for your vaccine development project on our website: https://ow.ly/FAAQ50SE7LZ #Evonik #DrugDelivery #HealthCare # #Adjuvants Evonik Health Care\n\nWhere is your parenteral controlled release project going?
