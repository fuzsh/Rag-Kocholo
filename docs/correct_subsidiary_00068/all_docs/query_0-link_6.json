        "text": "Yahoo! has acquired international online advertising network BlueLithium for $300m (£150m) in the latest move to cash-in on the growing trend of behavioural ad targeting.\n\nBlueLithium is one of a number of companies that uses technology to compile information on users by tracking their online browsing habits, which in turn enables more accurate targeting of relevant online ads.\n\nThe agency, which claims to be the fifth largest online advertising network in the US and the second largest in the UK, has around 1,000 websites that will be added to Yahoo!'s own growing operation in this area.\n\nJerry Yang, chief executive of Yahoo!, said the purchase would allow the company to deliver \"advanced targeting and innovative media buying strategies\".\n\nBlueLithium chief executive Gurbaksh Chahal will remain with the agency for an interim integration period as the company becomes a wholly-owned subsidiary of Yahoo!.\n\nIn April Yahoo! acquired the remaining 80% of online advertising exchange Right Media that it didn't already own for $680m (£338m). The company had previously paid $45m for a 20% stake in Right Media.\n\nYahoo!'s deal is the latest in a string of acquisitions in the online advertising sector.\n\nAOL recently announced that it was to buy behavioural advertising firm Tacoda for around $300m (£149m).\n\nGoogle is paying $3.1bn (£1.54bn) for DoubleClick's network; Microsoft is buying Aquantive for $6bn (£2.98bn); and Sir Martin Sorrell's WPP acquired 24/7 real Media for $650m (£323m).\n\n· To contact the MediaGuardian newsdesk email editor@mediatheguardian.com or phone 020 7239 9857.
