        "text": "As an expression of gratitude, Ivoclar ended its landmark anniversary year with a display of light on the new office building at the company headquarters in Liechtenstein: The building, which was inaugurated in the centenary year, was lit up in the company colours for several days in December, symbolically lighting the way to a bright future for the company.\n\nAt the end of the year, Ivoclar proudly looked back on twelve months of many different 100-year anniversary activities and events around the world, celebrating the company’s historic milestone. Exhibitions, special events for customers and international symposia as well as a series of festivities for company employees took place under the theme of “A Century of Innovation. “We used the centenary celebrations to say thank you to our customers, business partners and employees. They have all contributed to making Ivoclar a leading international dental company. We wish to thank everyone who helped us get to where we are today,” said Markus Heinz, who has been heading up the Group as CEO since last March.\n\nIvoclar – a pioneer of the dental industry\n\nIvoclar provided a visual grand finale to this very special year by illuminating the company’s head office building in Schaan, Liechtenstein, in the company colours of blue and green. “Just as smoothly as the colours blend into each other, we will transition from the past century of innovation into the next,” said Heinz. “We have played a significant part in shaping the dental industry and strive to continue being a leader in this field in the future.” To stay ahead of the game, Ivoclar relies on its inhouse research and development department, which is one of the biggest in the industry and the holder of numerous patents: for the blue lithium disilicate blocks (IPS e.max CAD) for example, which Ivoclar introduced to the general public at IDS 2005. At that time, competitors did not take this exceptionally strong and highly esthetic material very seriously. Nevertheless, the product known as IPS e.max CAD quickly gained immense popularity among customers and subsequently revolutionized the dental industry. The company is extremely proud of the fact that IPS e.max remains the top-selling all-ceramic system among dental laboratories and practices to this day.\n\nAn appreciation of employees\n\nOne of the highlights of the 100-year celebrations took place in Schaan, Liechtenstein, where the company, which was founded in 1923 in Zurich, Switzerland, has had its headquarters since 1933. It was the official 100-year commemoration ceremony and the grand opening of the new head office building in June. A few days later the company showed its appreciation for its employees by hosting a special family day party. Furthermore, the employees of the company’s 56 subsidiaries and branch offices celebrated the centenary at similar events throughout the world. “Our 3700 employees across the globe share the same values. They all give their best every day to help our customers put a smile on people’s faces. This common goal and strong connection were particularly palpable during this memorable year, across all national boundaries, and will continue to be with us in the future. Our teams are motivated and committed to achieving great things in the future. For this we would like to thank them,” said CEO Markus Heinz."
