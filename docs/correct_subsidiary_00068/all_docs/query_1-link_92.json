        "text": "Li-Cycle awarded multi-year contract to recycle manufacturing scrap generated from Ultium Cells’ Lordstown, Ohio mega-factory\n\nOriginal article published in Businesswire\n\nTORONTO, Ontario (May [11], 2021) – Li-Cycle Corp. (“Li-Cycle” or “the Company”), an industry leader in lithium-ion battery resource recovery and the leading lithium-ion battery recycler in North America, today announced an agreement with Ultium Cells LLC (“Ultium”), a joint venture of General Motors (“GM”) and LG Energy Solution (“LGES”), to recycle up to 100% of the scrap generated by battery cell manufacturing at Ultium’s Lordstown, Ohio mega-factory. Li-Cycle will recover the raw materials contained in the scrap, transforming them into valuable products helping contribute to the circular economy.\n\nAs North America’s electric vehicle (EV) production ramps up, this recycling partnership will be an essential piece in closing the battery supply chain loop and enabling sustainable production of new EV batteries. When fully operational in 2022, the $2.3 billion Ultium battery cell manufacturing facility in Lordstown will span 3 million-square-feet, making it one of the largest EV battery manufacturing plants in North America. Li-Cycle will help GM expand upon the materials it currently recycles today and will play a key role in GM’s zero-waste initiative by rerouting battery manufacturing scrap back into the supply chain through this multi-year contract.\n\n“This collaboration with Li-Cycle will form an important part of GM’s zero-waste initiative, which aims to divert more than 90% of manufacturing waste from landfills and incineration globally by 2025,” said Thomas Gallagher, Chief Operating Officer, Ultium Cells LLC. “It will also help increase the supply of available battery-grade materials, eventually reducing the need for mining.”\n\n“Our combined efforts with Ultium and GM will be instrumental in redirecting battery manufacturing scrap from landfills and returning a substantial amount of valuable battery grade materials back into the battery supply chain,” said Ajay Kochhar, President, Chief Executive Officer and Co-Founder, Li-Cycle. “This partnership is a critical step forward in advancing our proven lithium-ion resource recovery technology as a more sustainable alternative to mining.”\n\nUsing Li-Cycle’s patented Spoke & Hub Technologies at facilities in the United States, Li-Cycle will transform Ultium’s battery manufacturing scrap into new battery-grade materials, including lithium carbonate, cobalt sulphate, and nickel sulphate, as well as other recycled materials that can be returned to the economy.\n\n“GM’s zero-waste initiative aims to divert more than 90 percent of its manufacturing waste from landfills and incineration globally by 2025,” said Ken Morris, GM vice president of Electric and Autonomous Vehicles. “Now, we’re going to work closely with Ultium Cells and Li-Cycle to help the industry get even better use out of the materials.”\n\nOn February 16, 2021, Li-Cycle announced its entry into a definitive business combination agreement with Peridot Acquisition Corp. (NYSE: PDAC) (“Peridot”). Upon the closing of the business combination, which is expected in the second quarter of 2021, the combined company will be named Li-Cycle Holdings Corp. (“Newco”). Li-Cycle intends to apply to list the common shares of the combined company on the New York Stock Exchange under the new ticker symbol, “LICY.”\n\nAbout Li-Cycle\n\nLi-Cycle is on a mission to leverage its innovative Spoke & Hub Technologies™ to provide a customer-centric, end-of-life solution for lithium-ion batteries, while creating a secondary supply of critical battery materials. Lithium-ion rechargeable batteries are increasingly powering our world in automotive, energy storage, consumer electronics, and other industrial and household applications. The world needs improved technology and supply chain innovations to better manage battery manufacturing waste and end-of-life batteries and to meet the rapidly growing demand for critical and scarce battery-grade raw materials through a closed-loop solution.

GM and LG Energy Solution are investing $2.3 billion in the facility to support EV manufacturing in the United States, and in turn, local jobs, education, career training and infrastructure. The plant will equal the size of 30 football fields and will have annual capacity of over 30 gigawatt hours with room to expand. Job seekers interested in challenging and rewarding careers in battery cell manufacturing can apply for open positions on the Ultium Cells website.\n\nAbout General Motors\n\nGeneral Motors (NYSE:GM) is a global company focused on advancing an all-electric future that is inclusive and accessible to all. At the heart of this strategy is the Ultium battery platform, which powers everything from mass-market to high-performance vehicles. General Motors, its subsidiaries and its joint venture entities sell vehicles under the Chevrolet, Buick, GMC, Cadillac, Baojun and Wuling brands.
