        "text": "16 year old kid starts a business from his bedroom, sells it 18 months later for $40m: you just know the video from him and three other top innovation legends is awesome\n\nThere’s nothing in the world like hearing exactly how it feels to truly mess things up from people who you just couldn’t imagine doing anything but getting everything right first time\n\nHere’s the introduction from the Stanford Graduate School of Business 2010 Conference on Entrepreneurship website:\n\nWhat things typically trip up an entrepreneur in starting and running a company?\n\nIs it getting the right business partner? Is it having the killer technology?\n\nCome hear from a panel of seasoned entrepreneurs, angels, venture capitalists, and board members as they discuss the common pitfalls most new entrepreneurs encounter when building their businesses.\n\nYou will learn from the mistakes that they have witnessed or experienced first-hand so you will not make them in your business\n\nHere are the speakers:\n\nGurbaksh Chahal\n\nStarted his first company, ClickAgents, in January 1999 at the age of 16.\n\nClickAgents was one of the first ad networks focused around performance-based advertising. Eighteen months later he sold it for $40 million to ValueClick.\n\nIn January 2004, he launched his second company, BlueLithium.\n\nThe company was focused on data, optimization, and analytics and became a pioneer of behavioral targeting.\n\nBlueLithium was named one of the top 100 private companies in America three years in a row by AlwaysOn, and in 2006, it received highest honor as Top Innovator of the Year. Yahoo! acquired BlueLithium in 2007 for $300 million.\n\nIn September 2009, Gurbaksh launched gWallet, a virtual currency platform for social media.\n\nHe has appeared on The Oprah Winfrey Show, Bonnie Hunt, EXTRA, Neil Cavuto, among others, and has been profiled in such publications as The New York Times, Entrepreneur magazine, and The San Francisco Chronicle.\n\nGurbaksh is also an international bestselling author of The Dream, the true to life inspirational tale of his entrepreneurial journey.\n\nCarol Sands\n\nFounder and the Managing Member of The Angels’ Forum and The Halo Funds.\n\nCarol’s career started as a bank officer with First Bank Systems.\n\nShe has also held marketing or sales positions with Motorola and Xerox Computer Services and executive positions at Arthur Young (now Ernst & Young) and Coopers & Lybrand (now PricewaterhouseCoopers).\n\nShe later founded Sands MarketingPlus, an international sales management and marketing consulting firm with advertising and PR agencies.\n\nIn 1997, she incorporated The Angels’ Forum Management Company, the parent company of The Angel’s Forum, a revolutionary company in angel investing that organizes individual investors with previous entrepreneurial experience to invest as a single entity using a venture capital model for due diligence, mentoring, and board management.\n\nStarting in 2000, Carol co-founded a series of four venture funds to invest in early-stage Silicon Valley start-ups.\n\nCarol also serves as the Chair of the Global Women’s Leadership Network and a board advisor to Facing History and Ourselves.\n\nShe is a Charter Member of The Indus Entrepreneurs (TiE), an Advisory Board Member for Silicon Valley Association of Startup Entrepreneurs (SVASE) and the ANZA Technology Network, as well as a member of The Forum for Women Entrepreneurs & Executives and the Women’s Forum West.\n\nShe is also a Director of the Sands Family Foundation, which funds early stage and pre NIH research relating to prostate and ovarian cancers.\n\nCarol received her BA in Business Administration from The University of Iowa\n\nMatt Cohler\n\nMatt Cohler has extensive experience working with great entrepreneurs to build lasting consumer Internet companies, having served in senior management roles at Facebook and LinkedIn.\n\nMost recently, he served as Vice President of Product Management at Facebook, overseeing the company’s product development organizations.\n\nMatt joined Facebook in early 2005 as one of the first five employees hired by the company’s founders and its first external executive hire, and he has been credited with helping drive Facebook’s strategy, organizational growth and product direction.\n\nPreviously, Matt served as Vice President and General Manager at LinkedIn, where he was a member of the company’s founding team.\n\nBefore LinkedIn, he was a consultant in McKinsey & Company’s Silicon Valley office and worked in Beijing for AsiaInfo, the telecom solutions provider that built China’s Internet infrastructure, prior to the company’s initial public offering.\n\nOther current affiliations include Special Advisor, Facebook and Board of Governors, San Francisco Symphony.\n\nMatt earned a BA with honors and distinction from Yale University.\n\nJorn Lyseggen\n\nJorn Lyseggen is a Norwegian entrepreneur and patent inventor with four start-ups, two trade sales and one IPO behind him.\n\nIn 1995, Jorn started Eunet Media AS, an IT consultancy that he sold two years later for $5 million.\n\nIn 1998, Jorn joined Mogul AS as CEO, growing the company and selling it in 1999 to Optosoft for $30 million.\n\nJorn then became CEO of Mogul Group AB, which became a consulting group of 400 IT consultants in Norway, Sweden, Finland, and UK.\n\nThe company was listed on the Swedish Stock exchange in 2000 at a valuation of $150 million.\n\nIn 2001, with a starting capital of $15,000, Jorn established Meltwater Group, a B2B online media monitoring company.\n\nSince inception, Meltwater has grown to 50 offices, 600+ employees, and 19,000 corporate clients across Europe, Asia, Australia, Africa, North and South America.\n\nIt has evolved into a Software as a Service (SaaS) company for SMEs and enterprise clients worldwide.\n\nThe company has grown organically, without debt or external funding.\n\nJorn also started GenKey, introducing patented game-changing technology to convert biometrics (such as fingerprints) into a public-private cryptographic key-pair, making biometrics viable for a whole range of new applications.\n\nJorn has applied entrepreneurial ideas to the nonprofit segment, creating the Meltwater Entrepreneurial School of Technology (MEST) in Accra, Ghana; MEST gives its trainees the tools to start new software companies, generating jobs and wealth on a local level.\n\nMEST’s first trainee class graduated in 2009 and will enter incubators supported by Meltwater Foundation in Accra, Oxford and San Francisco.\n\nIt’s not easy (for anyone who wasn’t there, or doesn’t know him: I don’t recall seeing his name in the video, but it was quite lengthy, so I might have missed it) to be sure who the ‘moderator’ of the speaker panel was on this session: Was it Mark Leslie? (he’s on the GSB staff)"
