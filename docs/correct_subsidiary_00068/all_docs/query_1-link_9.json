        "text": "\"BlueLithium\" was founded by Gurbaksh Chahal in on January 12, 2004. The company's office was set up office in San Jose, CA, and got investment from Walden Venture Capital and 3i. The company, which has 120 employees and its network focused on data, optimization, analytics and a pioneer of behavioral targeting. Gurbaksh Chahal has been recognized as an innovator in the online advertising space by Business 2.0 as well as a sought-after speaker, featured at conferences including Red Herring, JP Morgan, Bear Stearns and Ad: Tech.\n\nUnder his leadership, BlueLithium was named one of the top 100 private companies in America three years in a row by Always On. BlueLithium has been named one of the top 100 private companies in America for three consecutive years.\n\nBlueLithium was serving 100 million+ unique users and reached more than 60% of US internet users. Whatâs more, they made $100M+ in revenue in 2006 - run the sums and you have another huge acquisition price (DoubleClick, by comparison, did $300 million in revenue in 2006 - Google paid $3.1 billion for that one). BlueLithium already serves up 8 billion ad impressions a month to 100 million users of the Web's top sites. Each of those ads drops a cookie on your browser, and when you show up on another site that serves BlueLithium ads or on one of its advertisers' Web sites, it adds that history of clicks to its database. Using this \"clickstream\" data, it determines within 10 milliseconds which ad to serve up the next time you come to any of the 1,000 handpicked sites where it buys ad inventory.\n\nOn September 4th 2007, Yahoo! announced that it has agreed to buy BlueLithium for $300 million in cash. He remains CEO of the company through the transition period. The acquisition of BlueLithium enables Yahoo! to accelerate its advertising, product, and engineering roadmaps, and gives the company increased capabilities to sell and measure performance-based campaigns both on and off the Yahoo! network. BlueLithium will become a subsidiary of Yahoo. The transaction is subject to customary closing conditions, including regulatory approval, and is expected to be completed in the fourth quarter of 2007. Chahal is a prodigy, a successful entrepreneur, and a writer. Know more about gurbaksh chahal at http://www.chahal.com"
