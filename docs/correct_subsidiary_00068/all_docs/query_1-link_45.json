        "text": "Schaan, Liechtenstein – 12 January 2024\n\nAs an expression of gratitude, Ivoclar ended its landmark anniversary year with a display of light on the new office building at the company headquarters in Liechtenstein: The building, which was inaugurated in the centenary year, was lit up in the company colours for several days in December, symbolically lighting the way to a bright future for the company.\n\nAt the end of the year, Ivoclar proudly looked back on twelve months of many different 100-year anniversary activities and events around the world, celebrating the company’s historic milestone. Exhibitions, special events for customers and international symposia as well as a series of festivities for company employees took place under the theme of “A Century of Innovation. “We used the centenary celebrations to say thank you to our customers, business partners and employees. They have all contributed to making Ivoclar a leading international dental company. We wish to thank everyone who helped us get to where we are today,” said Markus Heinz, who has been heading up the Group as CEO since last March.\n\nIvoclar – a pioneer of the dental industry\n\nIvoclar provided a visual grand finale to this very special year by illuminating the company’s head office building in Schaan, Liechtenstein, in the company colours of blue and green. “Just as smoothly as the colours blend into each other, we will transition from the past century of innovation into the next,” said Heinz. “We have played a significant part in shaping the dental industry and strive to continue being a leader in this field in the future.” To stay ahead of the game, Ivoclar relies on its inhouse research and development department, which is one of the biggest in the industry and the holder of numerous patents: for the blue lithium disilicate blocks (IPS e.max CAD) for example, which Ivoclar introduced to the general public at IDS 2005. At that time, competitors did not take this exceptionally strong and highly esthetic material very seriously. Nevertheless, the product known as IPS e.max CAD quickly gained immense popularity among customers and subsequently revolutionized the dental industry. The company is extremely proud of the fact that IPS e.max remains the top-selling all-ceramic system among dental laboratories and practices to this day."
