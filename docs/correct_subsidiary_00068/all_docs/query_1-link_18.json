        "text": "(1) This Registration Statement covers, in addition to the number of shares of Yahoo! Inc., a Delaware corporation (the Company or the Registrant), common stock, par value $0.001 per share (the Common Stock), stated above, options and other rights to purchase or acquire the shares of Common Stock covered by this Registration Statement and, pursuant to Rule 416(c) under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the Securities Act), an additional indeterminate number of shares, options and rights that may be offered or issued pursuant to the BlueLithium, Inc. 2004 Stock Option Plan and the BlueLithium, Inc. 2007 Restricted Stock Unit Plan (the BlueLithium Plans) as a result of one or more adjustments under these plans to prevent dilution resulting from one or more stock splits, stock dividends or similar transactions. Stock awards outstanding under the BlueLithium Plans were assumed by the Company following the effectiveness of the merger of Bay Acquisition Corp., a Delaware corporation and wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company (Bay Acquisition Corp.), with and into BlueLithium, Inc., a Delaware corporation (BlueLithium), pursuant to the Agreement and Plan of Merger, dated as of August 30, 2007, by and among the Company, BlueLithium, Bay Acquisition Corp., and Gurbaksh Chahal as stockholders agent. b. The undersigned Registrant hereby undertakes that, for purposes of determining any liability under the Securities Act, each filing of the Registrants annual report pursuant to Section 13(a) or Section 15(d) of the Exchange Act (and, where applicable, each filing of an employee benefit plans annual report pursuant to Section 15(d) of the Exchange Act) that is incorporated by reference in this Registration Statement shall be deemed to be a new registration statement relating to the securities offered therein, and the offering of such securities at that time shall be deemed to be the initial bona fide offering thereof. h. Insofar as indemnification for liabilities arising under the Securities Act may be permitted to directors, officers and controlling persons of the Registrant pursuant to the provisions described in Item 6 above, or otherwise, the Registrant has been advised that in the opinion of the Commission such indemnification is against public policy as expressed in the Securities Act and is, therefore, unenforceable. In the event that a claim for indemnification against such liabilities (other than the payment by the Registrant of expenses incurred or paid by a director, officer or controlling person of the Registrant in the successful defense of any action, suit or proceeding) is asserted by such director, officer or controlling person in connection with the securities being registered, the Registrant will, unless in the opinion of its counsel the matter has been settled by controlling precedent, submit to a court of appropriate jurisdiction the question whether such indemnification by it is against public policy as expressed in the Securities Act and will be governed by the final adjudication of such issue. (a) The Administrator. The Plan shall be administered by and all Awards under the Plan shall be authorized by the Administrator. The Administrator means the Board or one or more committees appointed by the Board or another committee (within its delegated authority) to administer all or certain aspects of the Plan. Any such committee shall be comprised solely of one or more Directors or such number of Directors as may be required under Applicable Law. A committee may delegate some or all of its authority to another committee so constituted. The Board or a committee comprised solely of Directors may also delegate, to the extent permitted by Section 157(c) of the Delaware General Corporation Law and any other Applicable Law, to one or more Officers of the Company or Parent, its powers under the Plan (a) to designate the Employees other than an Officer who is a Reporting Person who will receive grants of Awards under the Plan, and (b) to determine the number of Shares subject to, and the other terms and conditions of, such Awards. The Board may delegate different levels of authority to different committees with administrative and grant authority under the Plan. Unless otherwise provided in the Bylaws of the Company or the applicable charter of any Administrator: (a) a majority of the members of the acting Administrator shall constitute a quorum, and (b) the vote of a majority of the members present assuming the presence of a quorum or the unanimous written consent of the members of the Administrator shall constitute action by the acting Administrator. (a) General. Restricted Stock Units may be issued either alone, in addition to, or in tandem with cash awards made outside of the Plan. After the Administrator determines that it will grant Restricted Stock Units under the Plan, it shall advise the recipient in writing of the terms, conditions and restrictions related to the offer (which may include restrictions based on performance criteria, passage of time or other factors or a combination thereof), and the number of Restricted Stock Units that such person shall be entitled to receive. The offer shall be accepted by execution of a Restricted Stock Units Award agreement in the form determined by the Administrator. (a) Changes in Capitalization. Subject to any required action by the stockholders of the Company, (i) the number and type of shares of Common Stock (or other securities) covered by each outstanding Award, (ii) the number and type of shares of Common Stock (or other securities) that have been authorized for issuance under the Plan but as to which no Awards have yet been granted or that have been returned to the Plan upon cancellation or expiration of an Award or otherwise and/or (iii) the maximum number of shares of Common Stock for which Awards may be granted to any Employee or Consultant under the Plan, shall be equitably and proportionately adjusted for any increase or decrease in the number of issued shares of Common Stock resulting from a stock split, reverse stock split, stock dividend, combination, recapitalization or reclassification of the Common Stock, or any other increase or decrease in the number of issued shares of Common Stock effected without receipt of consideration by the Company; provided, however, that conversion of any convertible securities of the Company shall not be deemed to have been effected without receipt of consideration. Such adjustment shall be made by the Board, whose determination in that respect shall be final, binding and conclusive. Except as expressly provided herein, no issuance by the Company of shares of stock of any class, or securities convertible into shares of stock of any class, shall affect, and no adjustment by reason thereof shall be made with respect to, the number or price of shares of Common Stock (or other securities) subject to an Award. (b) Corporate Transactions. In the event of the proposed dissolution or liquidation of the Company, each Award will terminate immediately prior to the consummation of such proposed action, unless otherwise provided by the Administrator. Additionally, the Administrator may, in the exercise of its sole discretion in such instances, declare that any Award shall terminate as of a date fixed by the Administrator. In the event of a proposed sale of all or substantially all of the assets of the Company, or the merger of the Company with or into another (b) Amendments to Awards. Without limiting any other express authority of the Administrator under (but subject to) the express limits of the Plan, the Administrator by agreement or resolution may waive conditions of or limitations on Awards that the Administrator in the prior exercise of its discretion has imposed, without the consent of the Award recipient, and (subject to the requirements of Section 13(c)) may make other changes to the terms and conditions of Awards. (c) Limitations on Amendments to Plan and Awards. No amendment, suspension or termination of the Plan or change of or affecting any outstanding Award shall, without written consent of the Award recipient, affect in any manner substantially adverse to such recipient any rights or benefits of such recipient or obligations of the Company under any Award granted under the Plan prior to the effective date of such change. Changes, settlements and other actions contemplated by Section 10 shall not be deemed to constitute changes or amendments for purposes of this Section 13(c). 14. Compliance with Laws. The Plan, the granting and vesting of Awards under the Plan, the offer, issuance and delivery of shares of Common Stock, and/or the payment of money under the Plan or under Awards are subject to compliance with all applicable federal, state and, where applicable, foreign laws, rules and regulations (including but not limited to state and federal securities law and federal margin requirements) and to such approvals by any listing, regulatory or governmental authority as may, in the opinion of counsel for the Company, be necessary or advisable in connection therewith. The person acquiring any securities under the Plan will, if requested by the Company, Parent or a Subsidiary, provide such assurances and representations to the Company, Parent or Subsidiary as the Administrator may deem necessary or desirable to assure compliance with all Applicable Law and accounting requirements. 15. Reservation of Shares. The Company, during the term of this Plan, will at all times reserve and keep available such number of Shares as shall be sufficient to satisfy the requirements of the Plan. The inability of the Company to obtain authority from any regulatory body having jurisdiction, which authority is deemed by the Companys counsel to be necessary to the lawful issuance and sale of any Shares hereunder and which Company has made a commercially reasonable effort to obtain, shall relieve the Company of any liability in respect of the failure to issue or sell such Shares as to which such requisite authority shall not have been obtained."
