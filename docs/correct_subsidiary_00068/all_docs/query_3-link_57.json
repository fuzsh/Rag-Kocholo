        "text": "While all of these processes exist in mining around the world - this is the first time they have been brought together in an innovation that is unlocking cobalt from pyrite in these steps:\n\nConcentrate\n\nOre is crushed to approx. 1 mm, and a pyrite concentrate is recovered using a combination of gravity and flotation unit operations.\n\nCalcine\n\nThe pyrite concentrate is thermally treated under an inert atmosphere to produce artificial pyrrhotite (calcine) and elemental sulphur. The sulphur is condensed from the kiln off-gas and turned into solid prills.\n\nLeach\n\nThe pyrrhotite is forwarded to a low-temperature, low-pressure autoclave for leaching. The leach residue is removed by filtration and further processed for sulphur recovery by remelting. The leach solutions are advanced through various minor metals removal steps (precipitation, ion exchange, and solvent extraction) to remove iron, copper, zinc, manganese. The cobalt and nickel are precipitated as a mixed-hydroxide (MHP) intermediate.\n\nProduct Recovery\n\nThe MHP is then refined for production of high purity cobalt sulphate heptahydrate. The target recovery from ore to product for cobalt is 85â€“90%.\n\nThe NSW Government has built a new 270km pipeline from the Murray River to secure a long-term water supply for Broken Hill and surrounding communities. The pipeline solution supplies homes and businesses with a reliable and high-quality water source.\n\nEssential Water is the water utility in Broken Hill. They have a significant business driver to supply water for economic development within the region. Essential Water have confirmed that they can supply the water requirements of the Broken Hill Cobalt Project using a pipeline between Broken Hill and the site."
