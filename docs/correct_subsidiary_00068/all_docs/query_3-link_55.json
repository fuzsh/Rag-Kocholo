        "text": "Do you own or work for a company that installs, distributes or provides other services associated with energy storage products? Are you interested in joining our valued client collective as a supplier of our products? If so, then please proceed as follows:\n\n– Click on the button below to access our online registration form.\n\n– Complete & submit the form for approval. One of our sales representatives will be automatically notified to evaluate this submission.\n\nUpon approval, an automated email will be sent automatically to the email address provided during your registration, which will include the contact details of your newly-assigned BlueNova sales representative as well as our latest price list and accompanying guidelines for trading with us.\n\nOur Product Knowledge Training initiative consists of a series of 1-hour webinar sessions. We focus on a single product range per session every 2 weeks, with the aim of providing attendees with a firmer overall understanding of the specific product range. This is an ongoing service that we gratefully provide to our entire valued partner collective. Attendance is optional & free of charge.\n\nThe elevated risks inherent in high voltage systems require a more intensive approach to training. Our HV Training sessions are therefore presented in person by one of our qualified engineers (either at our main Somerset West facilities or Centurion branch). Prospective attendees should have the necessary prerequisite experience to apply.\n\nBlueNova’s entire business model is centered around the wholesale supply of our products to suitably qualified professionals in the energy industry. This not only maximises the distribution footprint of our products to the entire Southern African region & beyond, but also ensures that they will be installed safely and correctly by qualified experienced hands.\n\nEven though we don’t supply our products directly to members of the general public, we would be happy to refer your enquiries to one or more BlueNova-approved partner companies that may be located in your proximity. For such referrals, please send an email to sales@bluenova.co.za with a description of your requirements and remember to specify your city/town of residence.\n\nAlternatively, click on the button below to view a map populated with the locations & contact details of some of our industry partners."
