        "text": "What is lithium?\n\nLithium is a mood stabilising medicine used to treat certain mental illnesses, such as:\n\nmania (feeling highly excited, overactive or distracted)\n\nhypomania (like mania, but less severe)\n\nbipolar disorder, where your mood changes between feeling very high (mania) and very low (depression)\n\nLithium can also be used to treat schizophrenia and some types of depression.\n\nIf you have a mental illness, your doctor will work with you to decide if a medicine is right for you. Lithium is just one option.\n\nYou might also know lithium as a chemical element with the symbol 'Li'.\n\nHow does lithium work?\n\nLithium is a mood stabiliser, but the exact way that it works is not known. Lithium may work by changing the release of chemicals like dopamine or serotonin in your brain.\n\nTaking lithium helps you to have more control over your emotions. It helps you cope better with bipolar mood swings.\n\nIt may take several weeks to months for lithium to start working. At first you may need to be on other medicines at the same time. These will help you to stay calm. You may need to be in hospital when you start lithium treatment.\n\nThe amount of medicine that you need varies from person to person. Your dose may depend on:\n\nyour age\n\nyour general health\n\nother medicines that you take\n\nIf you take lithium, you will need to see your doctor regularly. Your doctor will arrange blood tests to make sure you are not taking too little or too much lithium.\n\nLithium is not addictive.\n\nDo not stop taking lithium suddenly. Always talk to your doctor before making any changes to your medicines.\n\nWhat forms of lithium are available?\n\nLithium carbonate is the active ingredient in lithium medicine.\n\nYou may be prescribed a slow-release form of lithium tablets. Slow-release tablets must be swallowed whole with water. They break down slowly in your body. This spreads out your dose of lithium through the day.\n\nWhat are the benefits of lithium?\n\nLithium helps reduce feelings of mania — excited, high mood, distracted. It also helps to treat bipolar episodes.\n\nYour doctor may prescribe lithium for long periods of time (months or years). It's important to continue treatment, even when you feel well. Lithium is not a cure, but it is able to help control symptoms and prevent relapse while you are taking it.\n\nIf you have been thinking about suicide (killing yourself), lithium may help reduce these feelings.\n\nImportant things to remember when taking lithium\n\nIt's best to take lithium exactly as the instructions tell you. Some other tips are to:\n\ntake lithium with food\n\neat and drink normally — don't follow a low salt diet\n\ndrink plenty of fluids in hot weather and during exercise to avoid dehydration\n\ntake care if you are driving as lithium can make you sleepy\n\nTell your doctor if you:\n\nare taking any other medicines as they may interact with lithium\n\nhave any heartor kidney problems, or have been told to reduce your salt intake\n\nare pregnant, planning to become pregnant or are breastfeeding\n\nare concerned about the side effects of lithium\n\nFollow your doctors' instructions about having lithium blood tests. The results will help get your dose right.\n\nAlso, remember to talk with your doctor and pharmacist if you take too much lithium or miss a dose.\n\nYou should also tell your pharmacist that you are taking lithium when you buy new medicines. This includes over-the-counter medicine and vitamin supplements.\n\nWhat are the side effects of lithium?\n\nLithium can cause side effects.\n\nShort-term side effects\n\nYou may have some short-term side effects when you start taking lithium. These can also happen when you change your dose.\n\nThese side effects often improve or disappear after a few days:\n\nstomach discomfort\n\nmild nausea or diarrhoea\n\nvertigo or dizziness\n\nmuscle weakness\n\nfeeling dazed\n\nPossible long-term side effects include:\n\nshaking hands\n\nfeeling very tired\n\nfeeling very thirsty\n\nfrequent or increased amount of urination (pee)\n\nstomach upset or weight changes\n\nmetallic taste in your mouth or increased saliva\n\nacne or rash\n\nheadache\n\nThese side effects may continue but try to also remember the benefits of lithium on your mania or depression symptoms when looking at this list.\n\nIf any side effects are worrying you, see your doctor.\n\nIf side effects suddenly get worse, it may be a sign of 'lithium toxicity', or too much lithium in your body (see below). If this happens, call your doctor immediately.\n\nLong-term effects on your body\n\nTaking lithium for long periods of time can affect your kidneys and your thyroid gland.\n\nYour doctor will recommend blood tests to check your:\n\nkidney function\n\nthyroid gland\n\nparathyroid gland\n\nSome people who take lithium for long periods gain weight. Talk to your doctor about managing your weight.\n\nWomen who take lithium may need to change to other medicines while pregnant. Discuss your medicines with your doctor before becoming pregnant.\n\nASK YOUR DOCTOR — Preparing for an appointment? Use the Question Builder for general tips on what to ask your GP or specialist.\n\nWhat is lithium toxicity?\n\nLithium is a medicine where the amount in the body needs to be just right. If the level is too low, it won't work properly. If it's too high, you can get more side effects — this is lithium toxicity.\n\nSigns of lithium toxicity are:\n\nincreased stomach pain, vomiting or diarrhoea\n\nincreased muscle weakness, shaking or twitching\n\nsevere drowsiness or dizziness\n\nstaggering or trouble walking or slurred speech\n\ndry mouth, very thirsty\n\nringing in the ears (tinnitus)\n\nblurred vision\n\nswelling of your face, mouth, or tongue that may cause trouble breathing or swallowing\n\nTell your doctor straight away or go to the nearest hospital emergency department if you notice any signs of lithium toxicity.\n\nYou can develop lithium toxicity suddenly. This can happen if you:\n\ntake too many lithium tablets at once\n\ncombine lithium with some other medicines\n\nget very dehydrated\n\nIt's important to take the dose that is right for you. If you think you or someone you care for may have lithium toxicity, it's important to talk to a doctor immediately.\n\nResources and Support\n\nSee healthdirect's medicines section for more information about lithium.\n\nYou can learn more about the different treatment options for mental illness on the SANE Australia website.\n\nYou can also call the healthdirect helpline on 1800 022 222 (known as NURSE-ON-CALL in Victoria).
