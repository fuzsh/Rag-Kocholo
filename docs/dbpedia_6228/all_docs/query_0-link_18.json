        "text": "8 May 1919 – 3 November 2009, Baird became a famous player at Aberdeen. He lived next to Overtoun Park. Archie escaped from an Italian POW camp in World War II and made his way back to Rutherglen. He wrote a book about his life. (Robert Harvey)\n\n​\n\nBaird was born in Rutherglen. Having played for local Junior clubs in the area, he signed for Aberdeen before the Second World War but the war started before he had made the first team.[3] He joined the British Army, but was captured and held as a prisoner of war.[3] He escaped and lived with an Italian family as their \"son\". In 1989, he published an autobiography, Family of Four, which described these experiences. Source: Wikipedia\n\n​\n\nIn 1915 Baird applied for a job at the Clyde Valley Electrical Power Company and was taken on as an assistant mains engineer, supervising the repair of all electricity breakdowns in the Rutherglen area.\n\n​\n\nBaird stayed with the power company for three years, but found it \"a horrible job\", often having to stand outside all night in the rain and cold. \"Sordid, miserable work, punctuated by repeated colds and influenza\", is how he put it, but he was unable to get a better job because he was always ill. \"Finally,\" he wrote, \"I decided it was hopeless and I had better try and start some business which was less strenuous and in which I would be my own master.\"\n\n​\n\nSource: scotlandonair.com\n\nHe had already taken a civilian job as Assistant Mains Engineer at the Clyde Valley Power Station in Rutherglen. He could scarcely have found more unsuitable work.\n\n​\n\nIt consisted in being on call at any hour of the day or night — he had a phone in his lodgings — to gather his gang of navvies and trace and repair electrical faults. He got cold after cold.\n\n​\n\nThe job was a dead end as he earned 30/- (₤1.50) a week with no chance of promotion because of his bad health and frequent absences. He was left with little alternative to launching out in business on his own account.\n\nHis first invention was an attempt to create artificial diamonds. He embedded a stick of carbon in a concrete-filled pot and passed an enormous current through it, to imitate the force and pressure which creates real diamonds.\n\n​\n\nThis fused all the lights in Rutherglen, and although he soon restored them his bosses were not pleased and it hastened his departure from Rutherglen and the Clyde Valley Power Station. In the ensuing unpleasantness the pot of possible diamonds disappeared and it has never come to light again.\n\n​\n\nSource: Helensburgh Heritage Trust\n\n​\n\nResearched by Colin Findlay\n\nBorn: 24 October, 1925, in Rutherglen. Died: 12 April 2012, in Balmore, near Glasgow,\n\n​\n\nDue to her married name, Mamie Magnusson inevitably found herself referred to as “the wife of Magnus”, the famous TV presenter on Mastermind who grilled lesser mortals seated in the famous black chair. But Mamie was a brilliant journalist in her own right, indeed a pioneer of women’s journalism in the post-war years, initially at the Sunday Post and later at the Scottish Daily Express on Glasgow’s Albion Street, at the time every young Scottish would-be journalist’s dream. Source: The Scotsman\n\n​\n\nMamie Baird is the mother of broadcaster and writer, Sally Magnusson\n\nSteven Campbell (1953–2007) was born in the Burnside district of Rutherglen, attended the town's Academy[1] and worked as an engineer at Clydebridge Steelworks before studying at Glasgow School of Art as a mature student, from 1978 to 1982. Initially he studied the then still new subject of performance art, but quickly gave this up for painting.\n\n​\n\nAt the end of his studies he was awarded the Bram Stoker gold medal, and gained a Fulbright Scholarship which he used to go to New York to study at the Pratt Institute.[3] This move resulted in many of his early exhibitions taking place in New York, including his first solo show, in 1983, at the Barbara Toll Gallery. Source: Wikipedia\n\nHe wrote a small amount of war poetry (in English) including Up the Line to Poelkapelle, The Sniper and a five-part sonnet cycle Sonnets in Captivity. Sadly he lost two brothers in the war and both parents died around the same time. He is best known for his humorous poems in Scots, often on Biblical themes, such as \"The Deluge\", on the story of Noah and the Flood. Books of his poems include \"Poems: Scots and English\", Further Poems\", \"New Poems\" and \"Random Rhymes and Ballads\" and he also wrote a dozen plays, short stories and several local history books. Cocker died in 1970.\n\nSource: The Sunday Class.\n\nJohn Dickson was a 17th-century minister in Rutherglen. He was a Covenanting field-preacher, He was imprisoned for his Covenanting activities.\n\n​\n\nThe Covenanters are so named for the series of bonds or covenants by which the adherents bound themselves to maintain the Presbyterian doctrine in consequence of the strenuous efforts Roman Catholics were making to regain their hold upon Scotland,\n\n​\n\nSon of Quentin Dickson of Dalmellington, John Dickson was minister at Rutherglen from 1650, and was imprisoned on the Bass Rock from 1 September 1680 to 8 October 1686, for preaching outdoors at services known as 'conventicles', without a licence. After the Glorious Revolution he returned to his old parish in Rutherglen. He died on 12 January 1700, aged about 71.

She started singing with jazz bands in the 1950s and her obvious enthusiasm for the music and her ready humour have continued through the years making her a popular performer who knows how to interpret a jazz standard. In 2009, Fionna was named as Best Jazz Vocalist at the Scottish Jazz Awards.\n\n​\n\nFionna was born in the Temperance Hotel, Garelochhead, during a ‘black out’ in the second month of World War 2. The family moved to Glasgow for her father’s business where Fionna went to Rutherglen Academy. Fionna did well at the Academy where she came away with a Higher Music Pass and was singing with various jazz bands in the area until in 1955 she became the vocalist with the Lindsay MacDonald Modern Jazz Quartet which had a regular Saturday night spot at Glasgow University’s Snug Bar.

Born in Rutherglen in 1832, he qualified in medicine and joined his father’s practice in the town. He soon established a reputation for clinical excellence. Indeed, a Glasgow Professor of Surgery stated that if he fell ill, Dr. Gorman would be the man he would go to.\n\n​\n\nIn addition to treating private patients, he took on the role of parish doctor whose duty it was to provide free treatment for patients on the Poor Roll. It was known that even if a patient was not on the roll but of limited means, Dr. Gorman would charge a reduced fee, or even no fee at all. He also assumed the role of factory inspector and was often first on the scene of an industrial or mining accident.\n\n​\n\nSuch was the town’s high regard for him, that after his death in 1899, the citizens collected funds for a memorial, and commissioned the sculptor John (Johan) Keller, Professor at the Glasgow School of Art, to produce the statue we see today.\n\nSir Robert Kelly was born in Blantyre in 1902, one of 10 children of James Kelly, Blantyre businessman, player and captain of Glasgow Celtic FC. Sir Robert was educated at St Aloysius and St Josephs, Dumfries and became a stockbroker by profession. Like his father, he became a director of Glasgow Celtic FC and was chairman of the club between 1947 and 1971. He was appointed to Celtic Board in 1932 following the death of his father.\n\nHe later became Celtic’s first President. For the best part of the next two decades Kelly’s influence would be all encompassing. He was a mostly conservative figure with an exceptionally high regard for tradition and discipline. Never one to duck from confrontation, with players or the football authorities, his reign was laced throughout with controversy.\n\nAs an administrator and legislator, he was a highly regarded talent and his expertise were utilised by both the Scottish Football League and the SFA, serving as president for both authorities. His persuasive debating skills were demonstrated in 1952 when he took on and defeated the SFA – who were threatening Celtic with expulsion unless the Irish tricolour was removed from the Parkhead flagpoles - in what became known as the ‘Flag Flutter’.\n\nIn 1969, he was knighted for services to Scottish football. He died on 20th April 1971. His rule of Celtic had been total. His sternness, stubbornness and meddling in team affairs had rankled many a player and fan. Yet, ultimately, he was the man who had overseen the greatest period in Celtic’s history\n\nTom McGrath (1940-2009) Born in Rutherglen in 1940, he lived in London in the 1960s and was strongly associated with the UK’s underground ‘counterculture’ as founding editor of the hippy bible International Times. He returned to Scotland in 1969 and studied for a degree in English and drama. In 1972 McGrath worked with Billy Connolly as musical director of The Great Northern Welly Boot Show. He also managed the Third Eye Centre (now Centre for Contemporary Arts) for three years from 1974.\n\n​\n\nHe is most famous for writing the popular play Laurel and Hardy. McGrath’s later work included The Hardman in collaboration with gangster-turned-sculptor Jimmy Boyle and an adaptation of Tankred Dorst’s Merlin. More recently, he was Scottish Arts Council’s associate literary director: a post crucial to the development of many younger playwrights which McGrath held for over a decade.

I never did. I have never returned to Scotland. Now that I’m a pensioner, that dream is now totally out of the question.” He now lives in Tea Tree Gully, just outside Adelaide, with his wife Halina.\n\n​\n\nJohn wrote about his family’s experience in Gepps Cross Hostel in the book Tin Huts And Memories, which tells how uncomfortable life was there in those early years.\n\n​\n\nLink: For John McGregor's full interview with the Rutherglen Reformer in 2018, click here\n\n​\n\nEdwin Morgan, 1920 - 2010, one of Scotland’s most talented poets was born in Glasgow and attended Rutherglen academy. As a child, he displayed his love of literature by the large amount of books he devoured. Recognising his vocation, his parents made a financial sacrifice to fund the many book clubs he joined. After school he was admitted to Glasgow University where he read French and Russian. Despite his commitment to pacifism, he served his country by joining the RAMC as a non-combatant. He returned to his studies after the war and graduated as an MA in 1947.\n\nAs an able scholar, he joined the University as a lecturer and was ultimately appointed Professor of English in 1975. He rapidly established his reputation as a poet with works ranging from classical sonnets to blank verse. Intertwined with his work was his commitment to Socialism and his love of Scotland. The quality and content of his works can be gauged by his volume of Collected Poems.\n\nFrom 1990 onwards he became increasingly involved in his support of the LGBT community, promoting its acceptance in society. Writings covering this and his many other interests is to be found in his work, Nothing Not Giving Messages: Reflections on his Work and Life, published from 1990 onwards.\n\nHis pre-eminence as a Poet and his contribution was recognised in 1999 when he was appointed Glasgow Poet Laureate. In 2004 he made history on his appointment as first Scots Machar. Other awards were the OBE and Fellow of the Royal Society of Edinburgh.\n\nAt the time of his death he highlighted two of his vocations by donating £980,000 to the Scottish Nationalist Party and £1,000,000 for the creation of awards to promising young poets in Scotland.\n\nBill McLennan\n\nBorn in Rothesay, John McAlpine moved to Rutherglen in the early 1860s to become Foreman Blacksmith in the shipbuilding yard of T.B. Seath & Son. He is noted in Rutherglen Lore (written by W Ross Shearer, 1922) as well known in Rutherglen for ‘being the only man to have ever sailed a ship all the way from Rutherglen Quay to London’.\n\n​\n\nAccording to his obituary in the Rutherglen Reformer, ‘during the 42 years of his residency in the Royal Burgh took an active interest in its municipal, parochial and religious affairs.’\n\n​\n\nHere are further extracts from the obituary, confirming the high regard in which he was held:\n\n​\n\n‘But perhaps it was as a Town Councillor he was best known. In 1880 he entered the Council and from that date until his health broke down a few years ago he laboured assiduously for the weal of the burgh.’\n\n‘He was a prominent reformer, and it was largely at his request that the proprietors of the Rutherglen Reformer first published the local paper for this district. At that time Cambuslang, East Kilbride, Pollokshaws, Strathbungo and Bridgeton were included. Most of the places have now, however local papers of their own.’\n\n​\n\n‘In his vocation as foreman blacksmith at the shipbuilding yard of Messrs T. B. Seath and Company, deceased was highly respected. Not only did he overtake his duties as foreman, but in the flourishing days of the firm, took a prominent part along with Mr Wright and Mr John Reid in all the launches, and it was to Mr McAlpine the late Mr Seath entrusted the safety of the newly-launched vessels in navigating them to the ports from which they were to sail.’\n\n​\n\n‘In all phases of life and work, Councillor McAlpine was a veritable Goliath. There seemed no task too great for him to successfully accomplish. But the time came, as it does to all mortals, when his health broke down and from that time he gradually became weaker.’\n\n​\n\nRobert White Murdoch (17 August 1944 – 15 May 2001) was a Scottish professional footballer, who played for Celtic, Middlesbrough and Scotland. Murdoch was one of the Lisbon Lions, the Celtic team who won the European Cup in 1967. He later managed Middlesbrough FC\n\n​\n\nBrought up in Rutherglen, he lived there for most of his life and attended local St. Columbkillle's Primary school (a classmate was Tommy McAvoy who went on to become the long-serving MP for the area),[3]before moving to Our Lady's High Secondary in Motherwell. Murdoch first joined Celtic in 1959, earning £3 per week as a part-time player while also being employed as a sheet-metal worker.[4] He played for junior club Cambuslang Rangers for two years to gain experience before joining Celtic as a full-time professional.\n\nSource: Wikipedia\n\nBest known for hosting the Radio 4 comedy series Just A Minute since it began in 1967, Parsons also hosted TV shows such as Sale of the Century, appeared on the likes of Have I Got News For You and the Benny Hill Show, and even guest-starred on Doctor Who.\n\nHowever, his earliest paid work came in the Royal Burgh in the 1940s, when he was a member of the Rep, then based at a church on East Main Street.\n\n​\n\nParsons was working in Clydebank at the time and joined the group to indulge his passion for theatre and comedy.\n\n​\n\nSeveral years ago he recalled his memories with the Rep, which was at the time known as the MSU Repertory Theatre.\n\n​\n\nNicholas told the Reformer: “I have got great sentimental memories of my time in Rutherglen with Molly Urquhart’s company MSU Repertory Theatre, in the old church.\n\n“I was an apprentice engineer in the shipyards in Clydebank at the time, and had a big rush to get back over to Rutherglen, and then afterwards get the last tram back.\n\n​\n\n​\n\n“That was my first professional paid acting experience and it was a wonderful time with some great people. I can’t believe that it was in the late 1940s, getting ‘the green car doon tae Rutherglen,’ and all those wonderful people, like John Macrae, the school master, who became Duncan Macrae, and Gordon Jackson was there as well.\n\n“Yes, I have so many happy memories of coming out to Rutherglen and appearing in those Scottish plays.\n\n“I’m an old sentimentalist – my grandfather was Scottish, so I have a attachment to my time there, and it was a good part of my life.”\n\n​\n\nSource: Rutherglen Reformer\n\nArchibald Clark Robertson, born in Busby, East Renfrewshire (15 September 1929 – 28 January 1978) was a Scottish footballer who spent most of his career with Clyde, firstly as an inside right and latterly as manager. He is the only Clyde footballer to have played in the World Cup Finals (1958 ) when still a Clyde player. Plus he is the only player to have scored a last minute goal direct from a corner kick in a Scottish Cup Final. (Ack. Robert Harvey)\n\n​\n\nRobertson joined Clyde from Rutherglen Glencairn in 1947, on a part-time basis as he continued his studies towards a degree in chemistry.[2] He spent the next 14 seasons with the Bully Wee, during which time he experienced relegation on three occasions, although he also helped the side win the Division Two title twice, in 1951–52 and 1956–57.\n\nSource: Wikipedia\n\nOn May 18, 1921 he travelled back to Scotland after telling his best friend that he was going back to marry his sister, Janet Gowans (born in Amesville, Pennsylvania, USA but the family moved back to Rutherglen during the coal strikes). James had no idea that Thomas was even interested in his sister. On September 4, 1921 they were married in Rutherglen and then on October 9, 1921 they moved to Canada.\n\nThey had 4 children: Richard Alexander September 5, 1922-2007, James David 1924-1960 (died in a helicopter crash, he was a pilot in WWII), Mary Isabel 1927-2017, and Robert William 1929-2002. The reason I started on this journey was the death of my great aunt Mary.\n\nNow some funny coincidences for you. Thomas presided over the funeral of Magnus Kustner in Mayerthorpe. This is only significant as my Grandfather Richard Sneddon (born in Medicine Hat in 1922) moved back to Mayerthopre after WWII and eventually married a girl named Helen Miller who is the granddaughter of Magnus Kustner. I found this out during my searches. Even more remarkable as we knew the family as Kiistner but during my research I found the Kustner name and knew that they had changed it to Kiistner but couldn't find their original name until I found this church record.\n\nMy brother’s first major girlfriend was in Bonneyville and when he brought her, she told us how her great aunt and uncle were married by Thomas while he was there.\n\nIn 1918 during the flu epidemic, there is a story that he helped out in the community and was known to help his parishioners and others at will. It was published in the town history of Mirror.\n\nThere is a stained glass in his memory at the Gaetz Church in Red Deer.\n\n​\n\nRecently I was given handwritten notes of baptisms of my aunts and uncles that he performed in Red Deer.\n\nJust so you know, my daughter and I came to Rutherglen this summer and we were in the Rutherglen Reformer twice as my search for my tree led me to a reunion I helped create the Gowans family (Janet's sisters' descendants) and the only living Sneddon branch in Scotland that I could find that were directly related to Thomas .'\n\n(Text and images by Aaron Sneddon, November 2019)\n\n​\n\nDouglas Campbell \"Dougie\" Thomson, born 24 March 1951 in Glasgow and raised in Rutherglen. He is best known as the bass guitarist of progressive rock band Supertramp.\n\n​\n\nThomson's musical career began in August 1969, when he joined Glasgow band \"The Beings\". In September 1971 he joined The Alan Bown Set where he briefly worked with future Supertramp colleague, John Helliwell. In February 1972, Thomson auditioned for Supertramp, and ended up playing several gigs as a temporary stand-in, joining permanently in 1973.\n\n​\n\nThomson played with Supertramp on all of their most famous albums: Crime of the Century, Crisis? What Crisis?, Even in the Quietest Moments, Breakfast in America, Paris, Famous Last Words, Brother Where You Bound and Free as a Bird.\n\nThomson was a member of Supertramp until the band went on hiatus in 1988.\n\nSource: Wikipedia\n\nRutherglen in Victoria, Australia is a small town renowned for its involvement in the wine industry. Its name is a memorial to one of the state’s founding fathers, John Alston Wallace (1824 -1901)\n\n​\n\nBorn in Rutherglen, Lanarkshire, he was the son of a successful draper, town councillor and magistrate. Leaving school, he went into in his father’s business, but went on to work for a draper in Glasgow. He then established a mining venture near Airdrie, but hearing about the gold rush in Victoria, Australia he went out there to join his brother in 1852,\n\nsoon making a successful strike in the Ovens goldfield. He used his newly acquired wealth to establish a chain of hotels providing accommodation for the crowds of hopefuls moving to the area to make their own fortunes.\n\n​\n\nHe continued his involvement in gold mining, and became a director of the Ovens Gold Field Water Company. Soon after, he established the Chiltern Valley goldfield. One of his contributions to the industry, was to use steam power as a more efficient means of separating gold ore from its detritus.\n\n​\n\nIn 1882, having sold off his businesses, Wallace entered politics and from 1882 to 1901 was a member of the Legislative Council of the Eastern Province of Australia. At the same time, he used his wealth to develop an effective hospital service in the area and to make generous donations to support the Salvation Army and provide succour for the poor of the state.\n\n​\n\nA financial depression in the 1890s had an adverse effect on his investments but this did not deter him in his political and charitable work. He died in 1901, highly respected by all who knew him.\n\nResearched by Bill MacLennan"
