        "text": "Three foreign nationals were sentenced in the District of North Dakota for their roles in an international fentanyl distribution conspiracy.\n\nDaniel Vivas Ceron, 43, of Colombia, was sentenced today to 27 years in prison. According to court documents, Ceron – while in prison in Quebec, Canada – was the leader and organizer of an international criminal enterprise that distributed large amounts of fentanyl. Using a contraband cell phone from inside the prison, Ceron and co-conspirator Jason Joey Berry, 40, of Montreal, Canada, arranged shipments of fentanyl and fentanyl analogues from China to Canada and the United States as part of the criminal enterprise. The distribution of these substances in the United States led to 15 overdoses, four of which were fatal, and 11 of which caused serious bodily injury.\n\nOn July 24, Berry was sentenced to 24 years in prison. Berry coordinated the acquisition of fentanyl and fentanyl analogues from China, the receipt the drugs in Canada, and the further distribution of fentanyl products to the United States.\n\nOn July 17, co-conspirator Xuan Cahn Nguyen, aka Jackie, aka Jackie Chan, 43, of Point-Aux-Tremble, Quebec, Canada, was sentenced to 22 years in prison. Nguyen assisted Berry and Ceron in acquiring fentanyl, distributing the drugs to the United States, and collecting the narcotics proceeds.\n\n“The defendants whose sentences we are announcing today purchased fentanyl from global suppliers in China and elsewhere and conspired to sell it here in the United States,” said Attorney General Merrick B. Garland. “These cases reflect the Justice Department’s commitment to going after every link in this global supply chain and to holding accountable those who profit from this deadly drug at the expense of families in North Dakota and across the country.”\n\n“The sentences announced in these cases are the result of partnerships across the U.S. government and with allies around the world to disrupt and dismantle the global supply-and-delivery chain flooding fentanyl across borders,” said Deputy Attorney General Lisa O. Monaco. “Today’s sentences also represent hard-won justice for the victims of this international trafficking enterprise, their loved ones, and their communities. The Department of Justice is grateful to the Royal Canadian Mounted Police for their invaluable assistance in this case. We must continue to work hand-in-hand with our partners in Canada and Mexico to fight the deadly threat posed by fentanyl in North America.”\n\n“These defendants are responsible for fentanyl poisoning deaths in North Dakota and several other states, and today’s strong sentence ensures accountability for those crimes,” said U.S. Attorney Mac Schneider for the District of North Dakota. “This result is a credit to the tireless work and seamless cooperation exhibited by our office’s prosecution team and their law enforcement partners in North Dakota, across the country, and in Canada.”\n\n“Disrupting large drug trafficking networks, like the Ceron Network, is vitally important to our ongoing effort to combat the fentanyl crisis in America and save innocent lives,” said U.S. Attorney Natalie Wight for the District of Oregon. “Networks like these span jurisdictions and stopping them requires robust coordination among many domestic and international partners.”\n\n“Homeland Security Investigations (HSI) plays a pivotal role in disrupting the flow of illicit narcotics at every point in the drug supply chain – we will continue to work collaboratively and aggressively with our partners wherever transnational criminal organizations source and manufacture these deadly substances that earn substantial profit by selling this poison across the communities we seek to protect,” said Executive Associate Director Katrina W. Berger of HSI. “HSI continues to advance its broad strategy to combat illicit opioids and today’s sentencings are one more testament to that commitment.”\n\nOperation Denial has led to 31 defendants charged in the District of North Dakota and three defendants charged in the District of Oregon. The investigation has resulted in nearly $1 million in cash and property forfeited from members of the organization. In addition to Ceron, Berry, and Nguyen, defendants sentenced or convicted in this case include[1]:\n\nDistrict of North Dakota\n\nJameson Robert Sele, 20, of Grand Forks, North Dakota, was sentenced on July 27, 2015, to three years in prison for conspiracy to distribute controlled substances.\n\nRyan Jon Jensen, 20, of Grand Forks, was sentenced on Feb. 2, 2016, to 20 years federal prison for conspiracy to distribute controlled substances resulting in serious bodily injury and death; two counts of distribution of a controlled substance resulting in death; distribution of a controlled substance resulting in serious bodily injury; and money laundering conspiracy.\n\nDavid Todd Noye Jr., 18, of Grand Forks, was sentenced on Jan. 25, 2016, to three years and three months in prison for conspiracy to distribute controlled substances.\n\nJoshua Tyler Fulp, 20, of Grand Forks, was sentenced on Jan. 26, 2016, to 12 years in prison for conspiracy to distribute controlled substances resulting in serious bodily injury and death.\n\nKain Daniel Schwandt, 19, of Grand Forks, was sentenced on Jan. 25, 2016, to three and a half years in prison for conspiracy to distribute controlled substances.\n\nBrandon Corde Hubbard, 40, of Portland, Oregon, was sentenced on Sept. 14, 2021, to 22 years in prison for conspiracy to distribute controlled substances resulting in serious bodily injury and death; distribution of a controlled substance resulting in death; and money laundering conspiracy.\n\nBraden James Foley, 28, of Olympia, Washington, was sentenced on Nov. 21, 2016, to two and a half years in prison for conspiracy to possess with intent to distribute and distribution of a controlled substance.\n\nAmanda Schneider, of Port St. Lucie, Florida, was sentenced on Jan. 17, 2019, to one year and three months in prison for conspiracy to possess with intent to distribute and distribution of a controlled substance.\n\nDanny Gamboa, 21, of Pawtucket, Rhode Island, was sentenced on Feb. 27, 2019, to two years and one month in prison for conspiracy to possess with intent to distribute and distribution of a controlled substance.\n\nKeveen Nobre, 29, of Providence, Rhode Island, was sentenced on April 17, 2019, to two and a half years in prison for conspiracy to possess with intent to distribute and distribution of a controlled substance.\n\nRobinson Gomez, 35, of Charlotte, North Carolina, was sentenced on April 17, 2019, to 15 years in prison for conspiracy to possess with intent to distribute and distribution of a controlled substance.\n\nDavid Campbell, 58, of Plantation, Florida, was sentenced on April 17, 2019, to 10 years in prison for conspiracy to possess with intent to distribute and distribution of a controlled substance.\n\nElizabeth Ton, 27, of Woonsocket, Rhode Island, was sentenced on March 8, 2019, to three years and five months in prison for money laundering conspiracy.\n\nLouis Bell, 31, of Port St. Lucie, was sentenced on April 18, 2019, to 17 years in prison for conspiracy to possess with intent to distribute and distribution of a controlled substance.\n\nAnthony Gomes, 34, of Woonsocket, was sentenced on July 30, 2021, to 30 years in prison for conspiracy to possess with intent to distribute, distribution of a controlled substance resulting in serious bodily injury and death, and money laundering conspiracy.\n\nJose Pinto, 64, of Pawtucket, was sentenced on Jan. 20, 2022, to time served and two years of supervised release for tampering with evidence.\n\nEugenia Pinto, 64, of Pawtucket, entered into a pre-trial diversion agreement on Nov. 18, 2021, for a term of one and a half years after admission to obstruction of justice and evidence tampering.\n\nSteven Pinto, 40, of Pawtucket, was sentenced on Oct. 14, 2021, to 33 years in prison for continuing criminal enterprise, conspiracy to distribute and import controlled substances, and obstruction of justice.\n\nVannek Um, 45, of Montreal, pleaded guilty on March 14 to money laundering conspiracy.
