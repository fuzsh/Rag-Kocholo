        "text": "Greg Campbell came into the Australian team at the wrong time for his career prospects. He had the makings of a good all-rounder, particularly in ODIs, as a hard hitting lower-order batsman and a bustling seam bowler. Unfortunately for him he had to compete with the likes of Steve Waugh and the mighty hitter Simon O'Donnell. He could not establish a regular place in Allan Border's fast-developing team and fringe Australian players can rarely hang around playing provincial cricket for more than a few years. Campbell had been playing for Tasmania for only three seasons when he was chosen for the Ashes tour of 1989. He looked as if he was about to fulfil his promise and the first Test at Headingley saw him bounding in from the football end as part of an all-seam attack. He was needed as a batsman and took 1-82 and 0-42.\n\nHis only wicket was Derek Pringle, given out lbw. For the remaining Tests Border wanted some spin and the enthusiastic Campbell had to give way. Sri Lanka toured Australia in the southern season and a Test match went to Tasmania's new ground in Hobart. Campbell was chosen and given the chance to take the new ball with Terry Alderman. He had the respectable figures of 2-41 and 3-102. He also got into the team for the second Test against Pakistan on the batsman's paradise in Adelaide with Merv Hughes as his new ball partner. He took 3-79 and 1-83, Rameez Raja and Javed Miandad being among his victims. His last Test was against New Zealand in Wellington, when he took 2-51 and 1-23. (Bob Harragan)"
