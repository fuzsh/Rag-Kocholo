        "text": "Greg Campbell's rise was spectacular but his brief career was dogged and ultimately ended by injury. A right-arm medium-pace bowler, he was picked for the 1989 England tour after 12 first-class matches for Tasmania, largely on the back of taking 36 wickets in the previous domestic season. He made his Test debut in the opening match at Headingley in the absence of Carl Rackemann, finishing the tour with 30 wickets at 27. He had another good season in 1989-90, taking 35 wickets and making three more Test appearances as well as ODI outings. But knee and wrist injuries blighted the next two seasons, and then a serious back injury led to Tasmania releasing him. He moved to Queensland but was unable to secure a place in their side and he drifted out of the game.\n\nCricinfo staff"
