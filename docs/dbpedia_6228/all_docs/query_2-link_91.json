        "text": "Steve Campbell looks back 90 years\n\nby David Goss (by permission)\n\nfor column Local Lore published in Telegraph Journal on Fridays\n\nMarch 28th 2003\n\nSteven Campbell of Breadalbane, near St George turned 90 yesterday and tomorrow at 2 p.m. at the St. George Baptist Church, friends will gather to honour the man who has probably done more as a citizen of St. George to keep the history of the area alive than any other.\n\nFifteen years ago he wrote three books reflecting on his 75 years in the St George area, \"Come Back With Me,\" \"Come Back With Me Again,\" and \"Remember When.\" Each one has sold well, and his stories dating to the \"way back days\" as Steven likes to call his early years, have helped many to understand the lives their parents and grandparents lived.\n\nThat includes your columnist, whose dad was born in the town of St George, who grandfather was the section foreman for the Canadian Pacific there, and whose ancestors on his grandmothers side were among the leading granite quarrymen of the district.\n\nFrom time to time I have met with Stephen in Friends Restaurant in the St George Mall where yesteryear is captured in half a hundred pictorial images owner Rick Doucet has placed on the walls for the enjoyment of his customers.\n\nAnd each time I have, Steven has added tales to those he has written out in his three books, and to amplify the many photos Rick has collected, some from Steve himself.\n\nLike the story related about my uncle Henry who was once involved with Steve in a sliding accident at Cemetery Hill. \"We usually depended on the horse manure to slow us down, but on that day, it didnt,\" Steven said. He was badly injured, in fact, he almost lost his eye. The local doctor advised him to save his money and go a Boston clinic to have the tear duct repaired. When he went there he took a hundred dollars with him to pay in advance as was necessary to ensure treatment. When the work was done on his eye, the doctor passed him back over $81.00. \"Imagine,\" he said, \"five days in the hospital and eighty one dollars and change back.\"\n\nAt our latest meeting at Friends, Steven recalled the days when three, \"sometimes four\" masted ships came in to the docks, pulled up the Magaguadavic basin by tugs and docked by the town wharf so100 pound bales of pulp from the St. George Pulp Mill could be loaded for shipment to the States. \"The men were glad to get the work in the depression years,\" he said. He wasnt one of them, though, working at that time on what he called the Black Line, which was, he noted, \" the placing of creosoted poles for the new power lines that passed the town.\" He got $3.00 a day for the work, \"Mighty good money then,\" he laughed.\n\nToday, the Pulp Mill is gone, and later in the day, Stephen took me to where it stood at the edge of the falls of the Magaguadavic. He explained that a bigger dam was being built and water backed up would run through turbines and then exit through tubes that will run under a rock ledge and into the Fundy. He is watching the project with interest, as both he and his dad worked in the mill in times past.\n\nThe Gosses didnt though, he noted, adding that the initial dam on the Magaguadavic river did have a connection on my grandmothers side of the family, the Meatings. \"They were involved in the granite industry. Their sheds got their power from the falls,\" Steven told me. Of the Meatings he said, \"The men were all built big, with mighty muscles. Everyone of them could play a wind instrument often the coronet.\" He added,\n\n\"they were the backbone of the town band,\" which he noted was \"famous everywhere.\"\n\nThe granite industry petered out in the 1950's, but not before Steven had a chance to see the remains of one of the last of the quarrying operations. \"At the Red Rock Quarries, I visited when you could still see the blacksmith shop, a horse hovel, tram tracks, and the mast and cables used for lifting stone,\" he said.\n\nToday, all that remains is stacks of cut stone that didnt pass inspection, so wasnt brought to the in town sheds for shaping and polishing. But it is still an impressive site for Steven has taken me there on a couple of occasions in the past when weve met for chats.\n\nAnd he says he will do it one more time the last Saturday of April or first Saturday in May.\n\nAnd that hed welcome others to join us. So watch this space and I will let you know how you can meet this remarkable Saint George native, and hear his stories of \"way back days\" in person.\n\n[If you would like to order any of Steve Campbell's books you can write to him at; Box 307, St. George, Charlotte County, New Brunswick, E0G 2Y0.\n\nAll his books are on sale at the Book Mart in the Charlotte Mall in St. Stephen, at the St. George Pharmacy at the St. George mall, and at Sears in St. George.]\n\nBack to Newspaper Articles\n\nBack to St. George Index\n\n©Charlene Beney 2003"
