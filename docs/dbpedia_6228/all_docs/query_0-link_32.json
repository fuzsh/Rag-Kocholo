        "text": "The Perfect Guy\n\nThe radio station hires a handsome new doctor to host a call-in medical show, but Frasier, nursing his male ego, is determined to find a flaw in his new colleague, who seems just a little \"too perfect.\"\n\nDoubt\n\nMyra Denning (Shannyn Sossamon) staggers drunk into the street and gets into a fight with a cabbie who won't take her to Brooklyn. She hurls a wine bottle at the cab; it breaks the window and while they're fighting, police arrive. Myra claims she was raped, and SVU is brought in. As they are taking Myra to the hospital, Ron Polikoff (Billy Campbell) arrives on the scene, and tells them that he is the one Myra will accuse of rape. Both Myra and Ron are examined at the hospital for evidence, and the case quickly develops into a classic \"\"he said/she said.\"\"\n\nThe Blaze of Glory\n\nSeth is determined to bring back the spirit and fun times of last year and won't stop until his plan is successful. Alex's jealousy is fueled when Marissa enlists an unlikely partner to help her with the school bonfire.\n\nThe Brothers Grim\n\nWhen someone from Ryan's past comes for a visit, he worries that nothing good can come of it; while the Cohen family welcomes the Chino visitor with open arms. As Marissa and Ryan continue to explore their newfound friendship, Seth and Summer face some unforeseen news. Meanwhile, Julie admits her mistake to Kirsten and looks to Caleb for help."
