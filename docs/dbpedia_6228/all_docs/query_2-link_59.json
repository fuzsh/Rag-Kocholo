        "text": "Sawyer S. Campbell, 21, died September 9, 2018 as a result of injuries sustained in a skydiving accident. He was born May 9, 1997 in Huntsville, the son of Michael Campbell and Rhonda Bishop Wiskoski. He attended Huntsville schools and graduated from Huntsville High School in 2015. He was currently enrolled at Auburn University majoring in building science.\n\nSawyer was active in the family business. He worked at his father’s farm in Tennessee since he was eight years old. He was skilled in operating tractors, bush hogs, mechanical rakes, and hay balers. He also helped manage 250 head of cattle. He worked in the family’s construction and real-estate Development Company. Some of his duties included wiring new buildings. He helped build restaurants, expand a church, a jewelry store, oversee house building and several small warehouses and hay barns.\n\nSawyer’s life was changed by a mission trip to Zimbabwe in August 2014 sponsored by Mt. Zion Baptist Church where he was baptized and is a member. That trip exposed him to abject poverty but also to people who were still having gratitude in their lives yet having so little. He also took a trip to India with his grandparents in 2015 that also shaped his perspectives. He became more caring and giving.\n\nSawyer was an active body builder, skydiver, having completed more than 120 jumps and scuba diver. He loved his dog Askem, a 130-pound Rottweiler, who he adopted from Craigs List in the Atlanta, GA area. The name Askem is African for king.\n\nSawyer is survived by his parents Michael Campbell of Fayetteville, Tennessee and Rhonda Bishop Wiskoski of Huntsville; his sister Taylor of Huntsville. He also leaves behind his maternal grandparent, Ruby Bishop of Paint Rock Valley, AL; his paternal grandparents, Shirley and Bill Campbell of Madison, AL. He is also survived on his maternal side by aunts, uncles and cousins in Huntsville area and on Sawyer’s paternal side he has numerous aunts, uncles and cousins spread across the United States.\n\nFuneral arrangements are being entrusted to Legacy Chapel Funeral Home in Madison, AL. Visitation will be on Saturday September 15 from 12PM to 2PM, Funeral service will follow at 2PM. Interment will follow at Maple Hill Cemetery.\n\nThe skydiving community has organized a day in honor of Sawyer. A fund has been set up which will provide free jumps and education during this Memorial Day for all of Sawyer’s skydiving friends and family. The following is the link for those that wish to participate in this event."
