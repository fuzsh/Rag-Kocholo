        "meta_description": "ROCKPORT – Steven G. Campbell, 57, died surrounded by family and friends, following a brief illness, Tuesday, September 11, 2012 at Togus, VA Medical Center.    Born July 2, 1955 in Killeen, Texas, he was the son of Linwood, Sr. and Geraldine Tolman Campbell.  Moving to Maine when he was an infant, Steve was educated locally and was a graduate of Rockland High School.  Following high school he attended Unity College where he studied to become a Maine Guide.    Steve enlisted in the U.S. Navy, serving for four years before being honorably discharged.    He had a love of the outdoors that stayed with him throughout his entire life.  He also had a passion for running, often finding trails throughout the local woods and mountains.  He enjoyed running many 10-K’s and was happy when he broke the 40 minute mark, and accomplishment for any runner.    After meeting David Hillgrove at the gym, the two became fast friends and trained extensively together in the art of Karate.  They attended many competitions throughout the state and Steve was proud to have won a championship while his parents looked on.  He eventually earned the rank of Black Belt.    Steve was often considered the life of the party and could light up a room with his infections smile.  Many have said he had the biggest heart and his sense of humor and good nature could win over anyone.  His loving soul led him to adopt a dog that had been rescued from Hurricane Katrina.  ‘Rocky’ became his constant companion and four-legged best friend.  Steve even played match-maker for his best friend, David, introducing him to the woman who would become his wife, eventually standing up with them at their wedding.  David said he will be missed ‘on the porch’ at 69 Broad Street.    For many years Steve owned his own carpentry business, working in the Midcoast area.    Steve’s greatest love in his life was his daughter.  He was immensely proud of her and loved to tell others about her travels and where she was in the world at that moment.    Steve’s passing leaves a hole that will never be filled.    Predeceased by his parents Linwood and Geraldine Campbell; Steve is survived by his daughter, Stacy Jo Campbell of Rockport; his step-mother Linda Campbell of Rockport; his brothers, Linwood Campbell, Jr. and his wife Charlotte of Rockland, Michael Campbell and his wife Aimee of South Thomaston, Richard Campbell of Rockport; his sisters, Jacqueline Campbell of Rockport, Susan Sadat and her husband Ali of MA; uncles, Kenneth Campbell and his wife Joyce, Percy Campbell and his wife Laura, Joseph Campbell and his wife Irene, Daniel Tolman and his wife Randi; Aunts, Alice Partridge and her husband Lewis; and Campbell and Tolman nieces and nephews.    The family also said the care and compassion they received at Togus was outstanding and something they will never forget.    Family and friends are invited to a Service and Celebration of Steve’s Life, 12:00 p.m., Saturday, September 29, 2012 at his home, 30 Chickawaukie Pond Road, Rockport.    In lieu of flowers, donations may be made in support of the Campbell family, c/o Stacy J. Campbell, 30 Chickawaukie Pond Road, Rockport, Maine 04856.",
