        "text": "British actor (born 1979)\n\nStephen Campbell Moore (born Stephen Moore Thorpe, 30 November 1979) is a British actor. He is best known for his roles in Alan Bennett's play The History Boys and the film based on it. He has starred in the sci-fi television series War of the Worlds (2019–2021).\n\nCareer\n\n[edit]\n\nStephen Campbell Moore was born in London as Stephen Moore Thorpe. He was educated at Berkhamsted School in Hertfordshire (appearing locally in the Pendley Open Air Shakespeare Festival) and trained at the Guildhall School of Music and Drama, alongside Orlando Bloom, where he was awarded the gold medal in his final year.[2] He made his screen debut in Stephen Fry's Bright Young Things. He is primarily a screen actor. On stage he has performed with the RSC and the Royal National Theatre.[3]\n\nCampbell Moore created the role of Irwin in the original West End stage production of Alan Bennett's play The History Boys, and also played the character in the Broadway, Sydney, Wellington and Hong Kong productions and in the film version of the play.[4][5][6][7]\n\nBennett, participating in a question-and-answer session with the play's director, Nicholas Hytner, said: \"I think, of the three teachers, Stephen Campbell Moore, who plays Irwin, has the hardest job because he doesn't have the audience's sympathy until two-thirds of the way through the second act. Both Hector and Mrs Lintott have the audience on their side whereas he – who is teaching and getting results, which, in the ordinary way, parents would approve of – is not thought to be sympathetic until he reveals himself as quite vulnerable. That came as a surprise to me when I saw it rehearsed. In a sense, it takes the actors to show you what you've written\".[8]\n\nReviewing the play for The Guardian in May 2004, Michael Billington wrote: \"Stephen Campbell Moore makes Irwin both meretricious in his methods, yet effective in his results\".[9]\n\nIn 2004, he starred as Lord Darlington alongside Scarlett Johansson in A Good Woman, based on Lady Windermere's Fan by Oscar Wilde, shot on location in Italy. In the same year, Campbell Moore played the part of Hugh Stanbury in Andrew Davies' BBC adaptation of Anthony Trollope's novel He Knew He Was Right.[10][11]\n\nIn 2005, he starred as Edward VIII alongside Joely Richardson as Wallis Simpson in the British television drama Wallis & Edward. In 2008, he appeared in one episode of the television series Lark Rise to Candleford as headteacher James Delafield, featuring alongside star Julia Sawalha, and had a regular role in the BBC series Ashes to Ashes. He worked on the ABC miniseries Ben-Hur in 2009, and appeared in the 2011 film Season of the Witch. In 2012, he starred as Titus in Jean Racine's Berenice, alongside Anne-Marie Duff in the title role, at the Donmar Warehouse in London.[citation needed]\n\nCampbell Moore played the role of Viscount Hugh Trimingham in the BBC's 2015 adaptation of L. P. Hartley's novel The Go-Between.[12]\n\nThe same year, he played the role of Maurice Wilkins in Anna Ziegler's play Photograph 51, with Michael Billington writing: \"The play is also anything but a one-person show. Stephen Campbell Moore catches perfectly the obduracy and awkwardness of Maurice Wilkins, forever tugging at his slightly too-long sleeves\".[13]\n\nIn 2017, he stayed in the cast of the BBC series The Last Post despite learning shortly before the start of filming that he required surgery.[14]\n\nAn August 2018 announcement indicated that Campbell Moore would be among the new cast to join the original actors in the feature film Downton Abbey, which started principal photography at about the same time.[15]\n\nRecognition and awards\n\n[edit]\n\nCampbell Moore was nominated for a 2006 Drama Desk Award for his work on the Broadway production of The History Boys.[16]\n\nPersonal life\n\n[edit]\n\nHe underwent surgery to remove brain tumours in 2012 and 2017.[14]\n\nCampbell Moore married actress Claire Foy in 2014.[17] They met while working together on the film Season of the Witch.[18] They have a daughter together, born in 2015. In February 2018, Foy confirmed that the couple had separated.[19]\n\nIn 2017, he met actress Sophie Cookson on the set of Red Joan; they reportedly began dating in November 2018.[20] They have one child together, born in 2020.[21]\n\nCredits\n\n[edit]\n\nTheatre\n\n[edit]\n\nYear Title Role Venue 2004–2006 The History Boys Irwin Lyttelton Theatre, Royal National Theatre, South Bank (2004–5)\n\nLyric Theatre, Hong Kong Academy for Performing Arts (2006)\n\nSt. James Theatre, Wellington (2006)\n\nSydney Theatre Company, Sydney (2006)\n\nBroadhurst Theatre, Broadway (2006) 2010 All My Sons[22] Chris Keller Apollo Theatre, West End, London 2011 Clybourne Park[23] Wyndham's Theatre, West End, London 2012 Berenice[24] Donmar Warehouse, West End, London 2013 Chimerica Joe Schofield Almeida Theatre, London 2015 Photograph 51 Maurice Wilkins Noël Coward Theatre, London 2023 When Winston Went to War with the Wireless John Reith Donmar Warehouse, London\n\nFilm\n\n[edit]\n\nYear Title Role Notes 2003 Bright Young Things Adam Fenwick-Symes 2004 A Good Woman Lord Darlington 2006 Amazing Grace James Stephen The History Boys Irwin 2008 The Bank Job Kevin Swain Burlesque Fairytales Peter Blythe-Smith The Children Jonah 2011 Season of the Witch Debelzaq Johnny English Reborn The Prime Minister 2015 Man Up Ed The Lady in the Van Doctor The Ones Below Justin Burnt Jack 2017 Goodbye Christopher Robin Ernest Shepard 2018 Red Joan Max 2019 Downton Abbey Major Chetwode 2023 Freud's Last Session J.
