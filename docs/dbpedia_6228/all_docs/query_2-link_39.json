        "text": "The services celebrating and honoring the life of Steven John Campbell, will be held 10:00 a.m. Tuesday December 15, 2020, in the Christ United Methodist Church, with Pastor Kwan Kim officiating, Burial will follow in the White Cemetery, Hunter, under the direction of Brown-Cummings Funeral Home.\n\nSteven was born December 9, 1949, in St. Mary's Hospital, Enid, Oklahoma, to John Monroe and Nora Jane Brandon Campbell, and passed from this life on December 10, 2020, at the age of 71 years.\n\nHe was raised on the family farm west of Hunter and attended Hunter Schools, graduating in 1968 as the class valedictorian. He attended Oklahoma State University, graduating with a degree in agriculture economics in December, 1972. After a brief period of service in the Peace Corps he moved to Enid, Oklahoma. He became a member of Christ United Methodist Church and served as a Youth Director. In 1977, he started farming with his father in Hunter.\n\nIn January 1978, he met Ruth Patton at a Christian singles group. They were married on July 26, 1980, at Christ United Methodist Church. After living in Enid for three years, they built a house east of Hunter and started a family. Timothy and Eldon made their family complete. He was very proud when his sons both achieved Eagle Scout, and he also enjoyed working with Cub Scouts in Pond Creek and Lamont. The church was the center of Steve's life, and he very much enjoyed singing in the choir and teaching Sunday school. He served all of the church committees, and also on the White Cemetery board, as well as being involved with the Hunter Community Center.\n\nSteve was diagnosed in 2009 with Hashimoto's encephalopathy and in August 2020 with advanced lymphoma cancer.\n\nHe is survived by his wife, Ruth, of the home; sons Timothy of North Enid and Eldon (Jen) of Enid; grandson Colton Campbell; his sister Jo Campbell of Hunter; and nephew Adrian Campbell of Norman; as well as special friends Larry and Paula Miller and numerous cousins and friends.\n\nHe was predeceased by both parents.\n\nIn lieu of flowers, the family would like memorials be given in his honor to the White Cemetery or Hunter Community Center.\n\nCondolences and special memories may be shared with the family online at www.Brown-Cummings.com."
