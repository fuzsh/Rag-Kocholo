With Campbell's chances of breaking into the first team small, the then manager Paul Le Guen allowed him to gain experience in the First Division by moving to Partick Thistle for the first half of the 2006-07 season. He went on to make 15 senior league appearances for Partick Thistle and scored his first senior goal against Livingston.\n\nOn 27 January 2008, Campbell signed for Airdrie United after spending over six months without a club after leaving Rangers in the summer of 2007. On May the 22nd he signed for Football West State League side Perth SC in Australia. [http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/teams/a/airdrie_united/7212283.stm ] .\n\nExternal links"
