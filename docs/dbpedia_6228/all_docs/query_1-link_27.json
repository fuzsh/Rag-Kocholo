        "text": "Steven Joseph “Soupy” Campbell, age 71, of Clifton Heights, PA, formerly of Upper Darby, PA, passed away on September 19, 2023. Born in Philadelphia, PA, he was the son of the late Thomas and Marie (nee Yankauskas) Campbell.\n\nSteve was a pressman for the Philadelphia Inquirer for 41 years. He was a long time fan of wrestling. He loved watching Survivor and The Amazing Race, and spent many hours watching TV Land and HGTV shows. He stated publicly that the Eagles were “bums”, but secretly rooted for them to win. He spent many happy vacations in Myrtle Beach and, once retired, enjoyed being a snowbird in Florida in the winter. Steve loved to dance, and no wedding reception was complete without him doing the Turtle on his back to Shout. He was a generous soul and will be missed.\n\nSteve is the beloved brother of Marie Breslin, Eileen McDougall (Bob), Judith Ramos (Victor), Patricia Millard (Wayne), and the late Thomas Campbell (Sherry) and Robert Campbell (Anne Marie). Also survived by many loving nieces and nephews."
