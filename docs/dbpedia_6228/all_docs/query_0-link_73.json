Carlton currently has 16 players who fit the criteria of 'Legend'.\n\nThe following players have been inducted into the Carlton Hall of Fame.\n\nInducted in 1987:\n\nRod McGregor - 1905-1920\n\nOne of the brightest stars of his era, Rod McGregor was a four-time Premiership player for the Navy Blues in a 236-game career that stood as a club record for more than half a century.\n\nHorrie Clover - 1920-1924 & 1926-1931\n\nHorace “Horrie” Clover was Carlton’s star centre half-forward of the 1920’s; a high flying, long-kicking champion who enjoyed a stellar career with the Old Dark Navy Blues, then went on to be one of our longest-serving administrators.\n\nHarry \"Soapy\" Vallence - 1926-1938\n\nIn a stellar 204 game VFL career between 1926 and 1938, Vallence kicked 722 goals - a club record that stood for more than fifty years.\n\nBert Deacon - 1942-1951\n\nDeacon was a star defender in two Premiership teams, a club Best and Fairest, and the first Blue to win the game’s highest individual honour; the Brownlow Medal.\n\nJohn James - 1953-1963\n\nThough just 175 cm tall, John James was highly skilled, tenacious and a spectacularly strong mark. In 195 games over eleven seasons (1953 to '63) he won Carlton's Best & Fairest three times (1955, 1960 & 1961) as well as the 1961 Brownlow Medal.\n\nJohn Nicholls - 1957-1974\n\nOne of the truly great players in the history of VFL/AFL football, and the man widely regarded as the finest ruckman ever to play the game, John Nicholls led the Carlton Football Club to two Premierships as captain, and a third as captain-coach, in a celebrated playing career spanning 18 seasons.\n\nGordon Collis - 1961-1967\n\nGordon Collis was a gifted key position player whose injury-hit career at Carlton was highlighted by his magnificent Brownlow Medal winning season in 1964.\n\nAlex Jesaulenko - 1967-1979\n\nWhen it comes to sheer football ability; to that rare spark of match-winning genius that sets champions apart, the immortal ‘Jezza’ - Alex Jesaulenko – has had few peers.\n\nBruce Doull - 1968-1986\n\nOne the greatest defenders of all time, he was an outstanding competitor, a four-time Premiership player, four-time Best and Fairest winner and Carlton Games Record holder for 16 years.\n\nInducted in 1988:\n\nFred \"Pompey\" Elliott - 1900-1911\n\nThe first player to appear in 200 VFL games, Elliott was a well-proportioned athlete with good endurance and impressive spring.\n\nKen Hands - 1945-1957\n\nAnother of the pivotal figures in the proud history of the Carlton Football Club, Ken Hands left an indelible mark on, and off the field at Princes Park. A two-time Premiership player, state representative, Best & Fairest winner and inspirational captain, Hands played 211 games and kicked 188 goals in twelve seasons beginning in the last months of World War II.\n\nPeter Jones - 1966-1979\n\nPeter 'Percy' Jones is one of the truly unique characters in the long history of the Carlton Football Club. His unbounded enthusiasm on the field - and his legendary exploits off it - endeared the lanky Tasmanian to generations of Blues' fans.\n\nInducted in 1989:\n\nNorman \"Hackenschmidt\" Clark - 1905-1912\n\nNorman Childers ‘Hackenschmidt’ Clark was one of the prominent figures of the Carlton Football Club in the early part of the 20th century. A champion player whose falling-out with coach Jack Worrall in 1910 had ramifications for both men, he played a vital role in each of the Blues’ first five Premierships.\n\nBruce Comben - 1950-1961\n\nBruce “Bugsy” Comben was a hugely popular and loyal servant of the Carlton Football Club for more than fifty years. After earning a wide appreciation for his courage, honesty, and reliability on the field in his 188 games between 1950 and 1961, he went on to further serve the Blues in many other administrative roles, as diverse as a committeeman, selector, player’s representative, recruiting officer and team manager.\n\nSergio Silvagni - 1958-1971\n\nAfter 239 games and 136 goals, two Premierships, one year as captain, two Best & Fairest awards and two Big V appearances, he went on to further serve the Blues as a committeeman, selector, and even a caretaker coach.\n\nInducted in 1990:\n\nGeorge Coulthard - 1876-1882\n\nPerhaps the first superstar of Australian Football (or Victorian Rules as it was then known), George Coulthard joined the fledgling Carlton Football Club as a 19-year-old in 1876. A local farmer, Coulthard had already established himself as a brilliant cricketer. But when he donned the blue cap of Carlton and ran out to join in the game that had gripped the colony like no other, Coulthard was a sensation.\n\nCreswell \"Mick\" Crisp - 1931-1941\n\nAt first, a dangerous flanker who combined brilliantly with Carlton’s champion full-forward Harry 'Soapy' Vallence, he later moved into the centre, where his tenacity and outstanding foot skills helped drive the Blues to the 1938 Premiership.\n\nRobert Walls - 1967-1978\n\nHe was just sixteen years old when he played his first game for Carlton, and goaled with his first kick. Eleven seasons later, Robert Walls moved on from Princes Park as one of the greats of a fabulous era. A three-time Premiership player in 218 games, he notched 367 career goals, was vice-captain for five seasons, and captain for two.\n\nInducted in 1991:\n\nCharlie Hammond - 1905-1909 & 1914-1918\n\nA revered son of the Old Dark Navy Blue, Charles ’Charlie’ Hammond was a five-time Premiership player for Carlton in the first decades of the 20th century. A tough, hard-hitting follower or defender, he walked out of Princes Park in acrimonious circumstances in 1910, but was convinced to return after a four-year absence.\n\nBob Chitty - 1937-1946\n\nDuring his successful and controversial career, Bob Chitty was widely regarded as one of the hardest, most single-minded players of all time. Hated by opposition supporters and revered by his own, he was utterly ruthless in his pursuit of victory, and heaven help any opposition in his way.\n\nJack Howell - 1942-1944, 1946-1950, 1952-1954\n\nCarlton’s Jack ‘Chooka’ Howell holds a special place in the history of both the Carlton Football Club and VFL/AFL football. His father was a Premiership player with South Melbourne in 1918, and Chooka himself won a flag with Carlton in 1947. When Chooka's son Scott Howell played in the Blues’ 1981 Premiership team, the Howells became the only family to have produced VFL Premiership footballers in three successive generations.\n\nWayne Johnston - 1979-1990\n\nA brilliant, hard-running, aggressive mid-fielder in four Carlton Premiership teams, Wayne Johnston was a player ahead of his time. Years before athletic endurance and absolute intensity became prime requirements of a league footballer, Johnston; ‘The Dominator’ carved his name with capitals into the history of the Carlton Football Club.\n\nInducted in 1992:\n\nJim Clark - 1943-1951\n\nInvariably described as loyal, brave and determined, James Robinson (Jim) Clark was a star for the Blues through the uncertain years of World War II, and the youngest member of Carlton’s 1945 Premiership team.\n\nErn Henfry - 1944, 1947-1952\n\nAt 182 cms and 82 kg he was big for a centreman, but his wonderful foot skills, his pace and his evasiveness made him a matchwinner. A Premiership Captain in 1947, Henfry won the Club Best & Fairest twice in his 84-game career with the Blues.\n\nAdrian Gallagher - 1964-1972\n\nOver eight seasons, Gallagher was an integral part of the greatest first ruck of all. He developed an instinctive, almost telepathic combination with champion ruckman John Nicholls and ruck-rover Serge Silvagni in an era when this trio were the platform for two Carlton Premierships.\n\nMike Fitzpatrick - 1975-1983\n\nAt 191 cm and 91 kg he gave away height and weight to many opponents, but he was clever, athletic and an outstanding mark. Adept at assessing his opponents' strengths and weaknesses, he was a fierce competitor who hated being beaten. Three-time Premiership player, including two as Captain.\n\nInducted in 1993:\n\nFrank Gill - 1929-1942\n\nRegarded as one of the very best in an era of star full-backs, Frank Gill was a Carlton stalwart for 14 seasons. Recruited from Nhill in north-western Victoria, he began his league career with the Blues in 1929 and went on to play 205 games.\n\nRodney Ashman - 1973-1986\n\nRod Ashman was one of Carlton's greatest rovers. A brave and skillful player who was part of two Premiership teams, he continued to serve the Blues for many years after his wonderful playing career ended.\n\nStephen Kernahan - 1986-1997\n\nThe numbers are impressive enough; 251 games, 738 goals, All-Australian, twice captain of Carlton Premiership teams, three times club Best & Fairest, captain (and leading goal-kicker) for eleven seasons in a row - yet this fabulous record only goes part of the way toward explaining why Stephen 'Sticks' Kernahan is revered as one of this proud club's greatest players and most inspirational leaders.\n\nInducted in 1994:\n\nCharlie Davey - 1927-1937\n\nA passionate Blues supporter from birth, Charlie Davey represented the Navy Blues in 143 games, kicking 121 goals and Captaining the Club in 1935.\n\nOllie Grieve - 1942, 1944, 1946-1952\n\nFor seven seasons immediately after World War II, Carlton’s champion custodian of the goal square was Oliver Kelvin ‘Ollie’ Grieve – a brilliant, close-checking defender who was a glorious high mark and a powerful, driving drop-kick.\n\nTrevor Keogh - 1970-1981\n\nA clever player, Keogh was not a penetrating kick but rarely wasted a possession able to pinpoint players and put the team to better advantage with smart disposal. A Premiership player in 1972 & 1979 and a dual Best & Fairest winner.\n\nGeoff Southby - 1971-1984\n\nSouthby arrived at Carlton in late 1970 as a 20 year-old and was a revelation from his first practice game. At 188cm and 87kg he was the perfect build for a key defender of that era. Twice Best & Fairest, two-time Premiership player and regular State representative, in 268 games he kicked 31 goals in his rare forays forward.\n\nInducted in 1995:\n\nMark Maclure - 1974-1986\n\nIn a long and successful career with the Blues between 1974 and 1986, “Sellers” Maclure wore his number 36 guernsey in 243 games, including solid contributions in each of the 1979, 1981, and 1982 Carlton Premierships.\n\nCraig Bradley - 1986-2002\n\nA consummate professional whose outstanding ball-winning ability, accurate disposal, punishing non-stop running and longevity in the game made him one of the all-time greats. “Braddles” captained the Blues for three years, won two AFL Premierships, and picked up almost every possible honour in a stellar career that spanned 17 seasons and a record 375 games for the Carlton Football Club.\n\nJustin Madden - 1983-1997\n\nMadden was one of Carlton’s great ruckmen; a 206-centimetre beanpole with outstanding tap skills, strong hands, and reliable left foot when shooting for goal. In a marathon 18-year AFL career that began at Essendon and flourished at Carlton, Harry played 332 senior games and kicked 190 goals between 1980 and 1996.\n\nInducted in 1996:\n\nJim Francis - 1934-1943\n\nFrancis was barely tall enough for a key position at 183 cm and 80 kg, but he was athletic, extraordinarily versatile, and a booming right foot kick. Captained the Blues in 1936 and again between 1941-43, he was a Premiership player in 1938 and was Best & Fairest twice.\n\nBarry Armstrong - 1969-1981\n\nBarry Armstrong was a fiercely competitive and capable footballer who played more than 200 games for the Blues in a long career and was a valued member of two Premiership teams.\n\nDavid McKay - 1969-1981\n\nFondly remembered as one of the most consistent and spectacular high marks of his era, David “Swan” McKay was a Carlton star for twelve years, and a key member of four Premiership teams.\n\nStephen Silvagni - 1985-2001\n\nThe AFL's Full Back of the Century, Silvagni played 312 games in a glorious 17-season career which saw him feature in two Premiership teams, claim the Best & Fairest award twice and named All-Australian seven times.\n\nInducted in 1997:\n\nRod Austin - 1972-1985\n\nOne of the most popular players of his era, he won Premiership glory with the Blues in 1979 and was cruelly denied a place in both the 1981 and '82 flag sides by injury.\n\nKen Baxter - 1938-1941 & 1945-1950\n\nIn ten seasons at Princes Park, Baxter was a Premiership player three times, and club leading goal-kicker on six occasions. Although he often spent time in defence or in the ruck – particularly early in his career - he kicked seven or more goals in a match nine times.\n\nInducted in 1998:\n\nWes Lofts - 1960-1970\n\nA pivotal figure at the Carlton Football Club for forty years, Wesley Victor Lofts was a tough, uncompromising Premiership full-back, and later, one of the Blues’ most powerful and influential administrators.\n\nKen Hunter - 1981-1989\n\nTo a whole generation of Carlton supporters, Kenny quickly became a synonym for courage. With his spindly frame, his socks down around his ankles and his trademark mop of unruly hair, Hunter ran into, and flew over packs from all angles to take spectacular marks week after week. Absolutely fearless in his pursuit of the football, he never shirked the fiercest of physical clashes.\n\nPeter Dean - 1984-1998\n\nThroughout his 248 games with the Navy Blues – including the '87 and '95 Premierships – ‘Deanie’ (later also dubbed ‘Helmet’ for his mullet haircut, or ‘The General’ for his on-field leadership) was one of the most popular Carlton players of his era.\n\nInducted in 1999:\n\nLaurie Kerr - 1950-1959\n\nIf three words were needed to sum up Laurie Kerr as a footballer, then they would surely be speed, aggression and courage. A blisteringly-quick winger, centreman or half-forward flanker, Kerr was a star player in a bleak period for the Blues from 1950 to ’59, and later, an influential figure in the Carlton Football Club for more than thirty years.\n\nKevin Hall - 1963-1973\n\nKevin \"Racehorse\" Hall was a solid, reliable, often inspirational member of three Premiership teams for the Blues, and later, a valuable and long-serving committee and board member.\n\nTom Alvin - 1984-1994\n\nEasily distinguished on the field by his long, shoulder-length hair, Alvin played 218 games and kicked 95 goals. A member of the 1987 Premiership side, he represented Victoria on six occasions.\n\nBrett Ratten - 1990-2003\n\nBrett Ratten’s career at the Carlton Football Club is a story of talent, determination, courage, and loyalty. Destined to be a champion of the club and of the game, he joined Carlton’s Under-19 squad as a 16-year-old schoolboy in 1988 and retired after 255 games for the Navy Blues, including the 1995 Premiership.\n\nGreg Williams - 1992-1997\n\nOne of the most brilliant and controversial players of all time, Greg \"Diesel\" Williams was twice rejected by Carlton as a youngster because he lacked natural leg speed. Nevertheless, he went on to carve his name into AFL history as a champion centreman at Geelong and Sydney, before returning to Princes Park and Premiership glory with the Blues. For sheer ball-getting ability, tenacity, and pin-point disposal by hand or by foot, Diesel Williams had few peers.\n\nInducted in 2000:\n\nGarry Crane - 1964-1976\n\nRenowned for his boundless courage, perseverance, and sheer ball-getting ability, Garry Crane was an outstanding big-occasion player for the Navy Blues in a celebrated 13-year career between 1964 and 1976.\n\nJim Buckley - 1976-1990\n\nJimmy Buckley played his first senior game in guernsey number 16 at the tender age of 16 years, 6 months and 18 days, making him the equal-youngest Blue of all. In a career stretching 15 seasons, Buckley would play in three Premiership teams and won the Best & Fairest award in 1982.\n\nWayne Harmes - 1977-1988\n\nA true utility, he was perhaps at his best in a back pocket, yet never failed to produce wherever he was asked to play. Just 177 cm tall, his barrel chest and solid legs meant he tipped the scales at 85 kg. He was surprisingly quick for his build, a safe mark, and a dangerous near goal, and he loved bursting through packs to set up play at both ends of the ground.\n\nMichael Sexton - 1990-2000\n\nOne of Carlton’s brightest stars in the last decade of the 20th century was Michael Sexton; a skilled, resolute defender who was born in New Guinea and grew up in Bendigo.\n\nInducted in 2001:\n\nIan Collins - 1961-1969 & 1971\n\nA courageous, uncompromising back pocket in the Blues' 1968 Premiership team, Ian Collins went on to serve as Secretary-Manager and President through some of Carlton Football Club's most successful, and later, most turbulent times.\n\nDavid Glascott - 1981-1991\n\nWith his slender build, his longish blonde hair and his baby face, he seemed anything but a star VFL footballer. But looks are often deceiving, and in Glascott’s case, the fresh face and spindly legs belonged to a determined and skillful midfielder who was a valuable member of three Carlton Premiership teams.\n\nAndrew McKay - 1993-2003\n\nA warrior at half-back for the Blues for 11 seasons, he was resolute, reliable and most of the time, utterly impassable. His career began with a Grand Final defeat in his debut year, then soared to redemption only two seasons later. From then on, through the near-misses of 1999 and 2000, and into the looming catastrophe of the first decade of this troubled century, Andrew Ian McKay stood – and still stands – as an all-time great of the Carlton Football Club.\n\nInducted in 2006:\n\nJack Worrall - 1902-1909\n\nThe first-ever coach of a VFL club. He was a brilliant leader, coaching the Old Dark Navy Blues in 144 games for 100 wins, 1 draw and 43 losses, including the 1906, 1907 and 1908 Premierships.\n\nGeorge Bruce - 1903-1913\n\nA pacey winger with flair and impeccable ground skills, he was almost unstoppable throughout Carlton’s historic hat-trick of Premierships in 1906 to 1908, and was regarded as one of the game’s first great big-occasion players.\n\nPaddy O'Brien - 1913-1925\n\nPatrick Joseph “Paddy” O’Brien was almost the perfect footballer for his era. Highly skilled, athletic and as tough as teak, he played 167 games and kicked 7 goals for Carlton in a celebrated career that stretched over 13 seasons between 1913 and 1925. Two of those matches were Grand Final victories; in 1914 over South Melbourne and in 1915 over Collingwood.\n\nJim Baird - 1941-1943 & 1945-1951\n\nJim Baird was a two-time VFL Premiership player for the Carlton Football Club, and one of the great all-round sportsmen of the post-World War II era.\n\nBryan Quirk - 1965-1975\n\nOne of Carlton's greats, Bryan Quirk was the football equivalent of a champion greyhound. A tall, beautifully balanced, long-kicking winger or half-forward, he arrived at Carlton at the dawn of the Barassi era, and carved out a celebrated, if unlucky career.\n\nSyd Jackson - 1969-1976\n\nA gifted, courageous aboriginal footballer who was a star in two Carlton Premiership teams. In 2005 he was named in the AFL Players Association Indigenous Team of the Century, and in 2006 he became the Carlton Heroes’ inaugural inductee into the Carlton Hall of Fame - an honour that everyone who saw him play would agree, was richly deserved.\n\nPeter McConville - 1978-1985\n\nWidely regarded for his consistency and his versatility, the powerful barrel-chested utility was a key factor in Carlton's golden run of three Premierships in four years from 1979 to 1982.\n\nAlex Marcou - 1979-1986\n\nAlex Marcou was a member of Carlton’s fabled mosquito fleet of brilliant small men of the 1970’s and ‘80’s, and a three-time Premiership rover for the Blues.\n\nFraser Brown - 1989-2000\n\nThe shaggy-haired Brown, who wore #20 in 177 games for the Blues, was a tough and fair midfielder with the occasional stint forward. He was a solid 'inside' midfielder with creative disposal, but lacked a yard in pace. And when we say 'solid' we mean 'brick solid' given his 90 kilo, 181 cm frame. He formed an amazing engine room with other Legends Greg Williams and Brett Ratten, providing considerable ball winning ability to the Carlton teams of the 1990's.\n\nKen Sheldon - 1977-1986\n\n“Bomba” Sheldon was an important member of Carlton’s famed mosquito fleet of the nineteen-seventies and eighties. Just 178 cm and 76 kg, he was a nippy, courageous rover who became a versatile utility as his career progressed.\n\nInducted in 2011:\n\nRon Barassi - 1965-1971\n\nIn a VFL career in which he played 254 games and kicked 329 goals, he wore our Navy Blue guernsey in 50 games, kicked 35 goals, and coached six seasons for two memorable Premierships. More importantly, he had swept away the complacent attitudes that existed before his arrival, and built the platform for Carlton's dominance in the next decade.\n\nVin Gardiner - 1907-1917\n\nMore than 90 years after he played his last match for the Blues, Gardiner still ranks tenth overall in our club’s list of all-time career goals. Described as the ‘biggest kick, inch for inch’ of his era, Gardiner led Carlton’s goal-kicking in seven of his eleven seasons, and was also the VFL’s leading scorer in 1911.\n\nJohn Goold - 1963-1970\n\nA brilliant, flamboyant, two-time Premiership player for Carlton during the Barassi years in the ‘swingin’ sixties,’ John William Crosbie Goold became almost as famous for his dapper appearance off the field, as for his exploits on it.\n\nAnthony Koutoufides - 1992-2007\n\nThroughout the history of VFL/AFL football, few individual players have actually changed the game. However, such was the impact of Anthony Koutoufides - “Kouta” to the masses of Blues supporters he thrilled during his celebrated 15-season career at Princes Park between 1992 and 2007 – that today he is recognised as the prototype of the 21st-century footballer.\n\nDavid Parkin - 1981-1985 & 1991-2000\n\nAmong the most respected figures in the long history of the Carlton Football Club, David Parkin was already a household name at Hawthorn when he arrived at Princes Park in 1981 to coach the Blues to three Premierships in fifteen interrupted seasons.\n\nInducted in 2013:\n\nDavid Rhys-Jones - 1985-1992\n\nRhys-Jones' rare football talents were sometimes lost in his all-too-frequent Tribunal visits. Not so at Carlton, the club to which the 1987 premiership player and Norm Smith Medallist committed in 108 matches (after 76 with the Swans).\n\nInducted in 2016:\n\nScott Camporeale - 1995-2005\n\nA member of Carlton's 1995 premiership team in his debut season, the man endearingly known as 'Campo' went on to play 233 games in the navy blue, earning All-Australian selection and a club best-and-fairest award in 2000.\n\nMil Hanna - 1986-1997\n\nBorn in Lebanon, Hanna quickly became a cult figure among the Carlton faithful in a celebrated 11-season career which included the famous 1995 premiership. The curtain came down on Mil’s 190-game Carlton career in 1997, but the boy from East Brunswick still maintains his love for the club with which he shares a deep-rooted territorial link.\n\nIan Robertson - 1966-1974\n\nRenowned for his running capacity and prodigious, penetrating kicking, Robertson was a fixture in a famed centreline comprising Bryan Quirk and Garry Crane through what was arguably Carlton’s greatest era. The grand final triumphs of 1968, ’70 and ’72 would crown a 125-game Carlton career for Robertson, whose later football life involved gamecalling for the Seven Network.\n\nJack Wrout (dec.) - 1936-1944\n\nThe late Wrout first embarked on a senior League career at North Melbourne in 1931, but after 53 games in six seasons with the Shinboners, became increasingly frustrated with a lack of opportunity. In 1936, Wrout crossed to Carlton and emerged as a star forward in the Blues’ 1938 grand final team, which broke the Club’s record 22-year premiership drought. Five years later, he took the honors as his club’s leading goalkicker.\n\nInducted in 2018:\n\nBrent Crosswell - 1968-1975\n\nRecruited to the club from the Tasmanian convict locale of Campbell Town, Brent Crosswell is remembered as a prodigious if enigmatic football talent – a genuine star in the star-studded Barassi-coached Carlton teams of the late 1960s/early ’70s.\n\nThough his career would fall two games adrift of 100 in dark Navy, ‘Tiger’ impacted tremendously on football’s grandest stage, as a member of the Blues’ drought-breaking Grand Final victory of 1968 and perhaps their most famous of all Grand Final triumphs in 1970.\n\nLance Whitnall - 1997-2007\n\nThe son of Carlton’s 66-game player Graeme, Lance Whitnall was considered the heir apparent to Stephen Kernahan as the club’s pre-eminent tall forward – a lofty task to be sure, but one to which Whitnall committed with purpose from the outset.\n\nIn 216 games through 11 seasons from 1997, Whitnall - or ‘Big Red’ as he was endearingly dubbed – capably served in Carlton’s front half, until a persistent knee problem at just 28 brought premature end to his on-field tenure.\n\nInducted in 2023:\n\nPercy Bentley - 1941-1955\n\nSince the formation of the VFL in 1897, only David Parkin has coached the Carlton Football Club more times than Percy Bentley - and few have served the Blues longer and with greater distinction than the former Richmond champion.\n\nBentley commandeered Carlton to the famous Premierships of 1945 and 1947 Premierships, then dedicated most of the remaining years of his life to the football club as Vice-President.\n\nFor Bentley, Carlton was everything.\n\nAdrian Gleeson - 1986-1996\n\nHailing from the rolling green fields of Koroit in Victoria's western districts, Gleeson fast earned a reputation as one of Carlton's truly durable small men, and a more than handy successor to the retiring Rod Ashman.\n\nIn tandem with the Blues' runners - the likes of Craig Bradley, Mark Naley and Fraser Murphy, Gleeson savoured Premiership success in 1987 and would capably serve his club through 176 games as a player before committing his time and substantial energies at board level.\n\nChris Judd - 2008-2015\n\nChris Judd joined Carlton from West Coast in a hail of publicity - and from the outset validated the club's greatest recruiting coup since Ron Barassi.\n\nNamed captain in his maiden season with the Blues, Judd reinforced his status as one of League football's truly great players of the early 20th century - landing the John Nicholls Medal for Carlton's Best & Fairest on three occasions, as well as the Brownlow Medal for the competition's preeminent player, through 145 quality games - before giving back at board level as a Carlton director.\n\nInducted in 2024:\n\nJack Carney 1936–1941\n\nHailing from the western Victorian rural locale of Ondit between Colac and Beeac, Carney joined Carlton in Depression times, having already represented Geelong in 79 matches including the victorious 1931 Grand Final.\n\nAt Carlton, the diminutive wingman who stood at just 162 centimetres in his custom-made size three boots, made an immediate impression, and in 1938 was part of the Blues’ drought-breaking Premiership secured with a 15-point victory over Collingwood.\n\nFarewelling football in 1941, Carney joined the RAF, serving throughout the Second World War as an aircraft mechanic, before returning to Carlton in an administration role. He served as team manager, reserves coach and as a liaison for the players, and continued to support the Club for four decades after his retirement.\n\nNeil Chandler 1968-1974\n\nJoining Carlton from the south Gippsland town of Welshpool in the summer of 1967, Neil Chandler turned out in 76 senior games for the Blues under the tutelage of Ron Barassi and (later) John Nicholls.\n\nA triple premiership player in his first 50 games, the understated ruck-rover featured predominantly in all three of Carlton’s Grand Final victories – the fabled Premierships of 1968, ’70 and ’72.\n\nWhat marked Chandler’s Carlton’s career was his versatility, whether as a tagger, half-back flanker or winger. Ever the team-man and incredibly modest in character, Chandler was a much-loved figure, universally respected by his on-field peers.\n\nBrendan Fevola 1999-2009\n\nConsidered one of the game’s greatest full-forwards, and undoubtedly one of its most controversial, Fevola represented Carlton in 187 senior matches after being named with selection 38 in the AFL’s 1998 national draft.\n\nA walking highlights reel, “Fev” revelled in the excitement of gameday, and the bigger the crowd the better he liked it.\n\nFevola’s 575-goal career put him in exalted company – ahead of Alex Jesaulenko on 424 and behind only Harry Vallence and Stephen Kernahan with 722 and 738 respectively. A seven-time leading goalkicker at Carlton, Fevola also has two Coleman Medals to show for his perennial crowd-pulling feats.\n\nCarlton Football Club Hall of Fame Legends:\n\nIn 1997, to coincide with the opening of the Legends Stand at Princes Park and the newly-introduced Legend component of the Australian Football Hall of Fame, Carlton elevated nine of its own Hall of Fame Inductees to Legend status for the first time.\n\nAccordingly, Craig Bradley, Bert Deacon, Bruce Doull, Alex Jesaulenko, Wayne Johnston, Stephen Kernahan, John Nicholls, Stephen Silvagni and Harry Vallence were elevated following a vote of Club supporters.\n\nToday, a total of 16 Carlton Inductees are recognised as Legends, with Ken Hands having been elevated in 2006, Robert Walls in 2011, Geoff Southby in 2013, Sergio Silvagni in 2016, David McKay in 2021, and Horrie Clover and Ian Collins in 2023.\n\nElevated in 1997:\n\nCraig Bradley\n\nBert Deacon\n\nAlex Jesaulenko\n\nBruce Doull\n\nWayne Johnston\n\nStephen Kernahan\n\nJohn Nicholls\n\nStephen Silvagni\n\nHarry Vallence\n\nElevated in 2006:\n\nKen Hands\n\nElevated in 2011:\n\nRobert Walls\n\nElevated in 2013:\n\nGeoff Southby\n\nElevated in 2016:\n\nSergio Silvagni\n\nElevated in 2021:\n\nDavid McKay\n\nElevated in 2023:\n\nHorrie Clover\n\nIan Collins"
