        "text": "Calallen head football coach Steve Campbell, who helped lead the Wildcats to 39 consecutive playoff appearances, announced Tuesday that he will be retiring after the school year.\n\nCampbell, 65, joined the Wildcats' coaching staff in 1984 and became head coach and athletic director of the program in 2022 after the retirement of Texas' winningest high school football coach, Phil Danaher.\n\n\"I think I'm in a small percentage of coaches who have lasted 42 years and I'm just really tired,\" Campbell said. \"I’ve coached in 132 playoff games and that adds up to 55 years of seasons, not counting track. I think it's time to take a step back and try to get some wind back in my sail, and see what’s next in my life. Who knows, I may even get back into coaching one day.\"\n\nMore: Replacing a legend: Calallen's Steve Campbell to lead Wildcats into new era\n\nMore: Castillo: Calallen football maintaining dominance for nearly four decades\n\nCampbell was born in Corpus Christi and graduated from Ray in 1977. He graduated from Texas Lutheran in 1981 and earned his masters degree at Sul Ross State University a year later.\n\nCampbell's first coaching gig was at Tuloso-Midway where he coached the Warriors' defense for two seasons before starting his journey at Calallen.\n\nCampbell went 20-5 in his two seasons as head football coach and has also won 17 district championships in track with two area championships, two regional championships with more than 70 athletes advancing to the state meet.\n\n\"Coach Campbell is a phenomenal man and he has truly impacted generations of Wildcats,\" Calallen superintendent Emily Lorenz said. \"He's been an exceptional role model for our students and has supported all of our programs throughout the years.\n\n\"We will be conducting a formal search for his replacement and will have a plan rolled out during the week. It's such and important position in our community and it will be big shoes to fill.\"\n\nCampbell said he will resume his current duties for the remainder of the school year and won't officially be retired until June.\n\n\"I tell the players often that they are the best part of my day,\" Campbell said. \"The athletic director job can sometimes have complaints that come in from every direction and the stress of keeping the playoff streak alive can weigh heavy on you. But whenever I go to athletics and I'm surrounded by these young men, all of my problems go away.”"
