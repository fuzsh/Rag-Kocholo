        "text": "After he was discharged from the Royal Australian Air Force in 1946, my father took me to watch West Perth. My memories are that until I started to play junior football at the age of thirteen (13), we went to virtually every game that West Perth played.\n\nI did my secondary schooling at Perth Modern School and elected to play “out of school football” with my school mates. As a result I played most of my junior football in the East Perth area – firstly Under 16’s at Inglewood Junior Football Club and then Metropolitan Juniors with Maylands – Inglewood. At the age of 19, l played a year of Amateurs with Collegians.\n\nEarly in 1958, I received a surprise visit from West Perth’s Vice President, Colin Cavanagh, who invited me to train with the Club. I was even more surprised (and of course delighted) to be selected to play the first league game of the year and after playing the first eleven (11) league games, to be selected in the Western Australian state team to play in the Centenary Carnival being held in Melbourne. The year was also memorable for my coming 5th in the Sandover Medal. In 1959 we finished 5th; Brian (Blue) Foley won the Sandover Medal by 10 votes and l came 6th in it. 1960 was my most memorable football year – West Perth won the Premiership against East Perth by 32 points and I was runner - up to Peter Medhurst in the Breckler Medal.\n\nDuring a playing career at West Perth spanning 1958 to 1965, (but excluding the 1961 season which I missed because I was studying in England), I played 132 league games; one seconds game and 10 games for Western Australia. Due to work commitments, I stopped playing football at the age of 27.\n\nIn 1968, I was invited to join the WPFC Committee and spent the year as a member of the Selection Committee. In 1969, work got in the way of my football again, so l didn’t stand for re – election due to working out of Perth. My work took me, my wife and 3 young daughters to live and work in Indonesia, then in Singapore and eventually in Melbourne.\n\nAfter a number of years living away, we returned to WA and in February 1994, I was appointed Inaugural Chairman of the Fremantle Dockers – a position that I held until the end of August 1998.\n\nIn 2002 I became a Commissioner of the West Australian Football Commission. In my 8 years in this capacity, I retained my West Perth membership and contrived to spend an inordinate amount of time at fixtures involving West Perth.\n\nIn 2018 I again joined the Board of the Club as Vice President and retained this position until standing down in the first quarter of 2020. I was made a Life Member in 2021 and my wife, Leith, and I were invited to become joint patrons in July 2022.\n\nClearly football – and especially the Falcons – has been a major part in my life. Needless to say I will continue to support the Falcons and help them in any way that I can, for as long as I am able.\n\n13. Laurie Richards - Player\n\nLaurie Richards born in 1947 was known as a footballer who could take high flying marks. Laurie started his senior career in 1966 and was West Perth leading goalkicker for the year with 36 goals. He was a key contributor to West Perth 1969 premiership with seven goals in the grand final against East Perth. Kicking a total of 72 goals for the season, topping the Club goal kicking for a second occasion. West Perth biggest win for the 1969 season was the third game against Swan Districts where Laurie kicked 12 goals 7points.\n\nLaurie Richards started his football career with Mount Hawthorn School in 1959 with his then coach Mr Dear. Laurie was soon identified as a sportsman of the future and playing junior football with Tuart Hill, Northern Suburbs and getting invited to play with the WPFC colts in 1965.\n\nBeing an athlete, Laurie was a born a sportsperson, his life was soon fulfilled by developing an interest in many sports. Little did he know that the great game of football would take him all over Australia. With a total of 248 league games in three states, Laurie was given life membership of West Perth in 2022.\n\nLaurie played total of 119 games with West Perth. Spread over two periods. 1966 through to 1970 with a total of 86 games. Then again in 1978 and 1979 playing 30 games including one state game for WA in 1979.\n\nLaurie was invited to Fitzroy and played 79 games over 1971 to 1974. He was invited to Woodville in 1975. And then he came back to Perth in 1977 and played for West Perth in 1978 and 1979.\n\nLaurie was recruited in 1971 to Fitzroy in the VFL, he was used mainly at centre half forward and on the ball. After kicking three goals on debut, he made 14 appearances in that year and then played 65 of a possible 66 games in the next three years. Laurie was runner-up in the B&F for Fitzroy in 1972 and played state football in 1973. Laurie was appointed vice captain in 1973 and took 125 marks for the year with the next best only taking 76. He kicked 24 goals for the season and averaged just under 17 disposals per game and became the clubs second best performer at the Brownlow medal with 8 votes.\n\nLaurie transferred to Woodville in the South Australian Football League, in 1975. Under the coaching of John McInnes, again Laurie had to wait for a clearance. He played 35 games over 2 years. Laurie returned to Woodville in 1981 to play another year giving him a total of 50 games and 64 goals.\n\nLaurie was a journey man who married Jennifer Fricker from Narembeen in 1967. They had two children Debbie and Jamie who also naturally moved from state to state to follow their father’s football career. Laurie had great support from his extended family wherever he went with his football career.\n\nLaurie played his football at West Perth under Bob Spargo, Graham Farmer, Percy Johnson, and Graham Campbell. He has played 119 games and kicked 242 goals at an average of 40 goals a year. Already mentioned that he was leading goalkicker twice and a member of the 1969 premiership side.\n\nLaurie has remained loyal to West Perth and supports the club whenever he can. His football career after West Perth was always with high achievements. Laurie played at Wanneroo under Greg Brehaut in 1980, was vice captain, won the premiership and won the club B&F and was runner up in the district medal. He also served as a state selector for WAFL that one year. Later after his return from Woodville he was captain coach of Railways football club for two years in Narrogin winning the Association medal and club F & B.\n\nLaurie joined the Northern Warriors veterans in 1982 and played 5 years. He was selected and played in two National Carnivals in 1984 and 1988 and was also selected in the Australian Veteran’s team in both years.\n\nIn the early 90’s Laurie was the message runner for reserve coach and great mate John Duckworth. They teamed up together again at Wanneroo in the mid 90’s for another two years.\n\nIt is well known that football income during 60’s and 70’s did not support a family, and players needed full time employment. Laurie acknowledges the support of the CBA in approving his work transfer to different states which allowed for smooth resettlement whilst following his dream.\n\nTogether Laurie and Jenny ran a newsagency business in late 70’s followed by seven years managing the Narrogin Residential College with 250 student boarders which was an extremely rewarding experience.Laurie finished his working career following 25 years as an account manager at Visyboard; the highly respected cardboard box making, recycling and paper manufacturing company.\n\nLaurie would like to add that he is forever grateful to the players and supporters of the West Perth Football Club for giving him the opportunity to be part of the team. Laurie believed in the value of education, and this is the main reason Laurie and Jenny have given money to WPFC to fund a scholarship for a player in the past few years.\n\nOne of our greats, Laurie Richards deserved Life Membership at West Perth.\n\nLaurie and Jenny have made a lot of lifetime friendships over there football journey that they value and cherish.\n\n14. Edward Flemming - Player\n\nEdward Flemming (Ted) was inducted into the West Perth Football Club Hall of fame in 2022. If awards were given for versatility, surely Ted Flemming would be a clear winner. In 1925, Flemming won the league’s leading goal-kicker with 50 goals, yet in 1930, won the Sandover Medal as a “high flying” half-back.\n\nEdward Joseph Flemming was born on 30 October 1902 in Boulder, and took up the game upon moving to Westonia, in the eastern wheatbelt, playing in the centre. Later, after moving again, this time to Perth, he played firstly with Maylands in the WA Football Association for two seasons, before switching to Highgate for a further three. Both clubs were East Perth heartland, but Flemming’s destiny was sealed when in playing a game for the State Taxation Department, he came under notice of two interested on-lookers; West Perth’s propertyman Bill Webster, and legendary WA umpire and later West Perth FC life member, Henry (Ivo) Crapp. Flemming snapped up the offer of a Cardinals try-out.\n\nJoining in 1922, Flemming commenced as a half-forward. The Cardinals’ famous Sandover Medal-winning triumvirate of Harold Boyd, Jim Gosnell and Jim Craig were already well entrenched across the half-back line, so when Flemming was initially called into action to help in defence, it was in the back pocket. However, in 1925, when West Perth were short of a full forward, it was Flemming that answered the call, and proved so effective and flexible that the 50 goals he kicked was enough to be the league’s leading goal kicker. His move forward was never permanent, as such was his skill and value to the team as a defender, he often started a game down back, and then moved up the ground if the Cardinals forward line was struggling.\n\nIn the next several seasons as players retired, Flemming became established as a renowned centre-half back. His first of two West Perth fairest and best awards was bestowed in 1928. Two years later, at aged 27, Ted Flemming became the Cardinals’ fourth Sandover Medal winner, by polling 23 votes, 5 ahead of the dual runners-up (this was the first year of 3-2-1 voting by the umpires). The Sunday Times’ coverage on 28 September 1930 of the result lauded Flemming’s win, noting the “decision will be well received, as Flemming’s task was made formidable by the indifferent showing of his teammates and the few successes gained by the side were largely due to the strenuous efforts of the high-flying half-back”. Interestingly, Flemming did not win West Perth’s fairest and best award in his Sandover Medal year.\n\nTed Flemming’s stature as a superb backman continued to grow. He was again well regarded for the 1932 Sandover Medal. The Sporting Globe’s preview of 7 September 1932 talked-up Flemming’s chances, stating he has “been in League football for eleven seasons, and is still playing brilliant football. During his League period he has been outstanding as an aerialist, and his freak marking has never been surpassed”. Flemming polled well, with 15 votes, to finish third, with Claremont-Cottesloe’s Keith Hough a runaway winner on 32 votes (Hough was one of the dual runners-up to Flemming in 1930). Season 1932 finished on a high for Flemming and the Cardinals, winning their first premiership in 27 years, with an 18.9 to 11.8 thumping over East Perth in the Grand Final.\n\nThis commenced a golden run for Ted Flemming and the club. Two years later, in easily defeating East Fremantle 11.7 to 5.9 for the 1934 flag, The West Australian’s review on 15 October said that “West Perth’s high marking was brilliant, men like O’Keefe, Flemming and McDiarmid seldom missing”. The Cardinals went back-to-back in 1935, beating Subiaco 11.8 to 7.9; once again, Flemming stood tall in defence.\n\nAnother personal accolade followed, with a second fairest and best award in 1936.\n\nFlemming’s breathtaking high-marking and leaping had the press speculating that he had been fortunate not to be injured; “there is none to live with him in the air, his leaping being remarkable, and it is ever a matter of wonder that he has not been seriously injured, for he jumps well above the pack with reckless abandon, and comes down with some great crashes”, published in 1932’s The Daily News, is an example. It is worthwhile to note that in his Sandover Medal year, Flemming was hospitalised with concussion in June due to a heavy knock, while in 1937, at Fremantle Oval, his right leg was broken below the knee.\n\nTed Flemming retired at the conclusion of 1937, after sixteen stellar seasons. It is a tribute to his standing at the club that he was named captain in this final season, in addition to also leading the club in 1931. Later, Flemming served in the RAAF during World War II based in Eastern Victoria and later worked at Essendon Aerodrome in the early 1960s.\n\n15. Geoff Hendriks - Player\n\nGeoff Hendriks was one of the youngest players to play WAFL football and the youngest ever West Perth player at 16 years of age. He went on to play 170 games for the red and the blue and retired at the end of the 1985 season to accept a school Principal position in Katanning.\n\nGeoff made his debut in the last game of the 1975 regular season against South Fremantle at Leederville Oval. The team needed to win in order to secure a second semi-final berth and were able to achieve a four-goal victory. Hendriks held his position in the team to beat Swan Districts in the semi final and two weeks later lined up alongside Lyndsey McGuiness and Ross Prunster to form the grand final half back line. In front of a record crowd, the Cardies achieved a record 104-point win over South Fremantle and Hendriks acquitted himself well with his performance, keeping the speedy Sebastian Rioli to a handful of touches.\n\nIn 1976 Hendriks had the unique distinction of having to mix his football commitments with his school commitments and after playing the first 10 games returned to play for Trinity College in the Saturday Alcock Cup competition effectively finishing his 1976 league season.\n\nThroughout his career Hendriks became the versatile utility player and played at least one game in every position on the field except for having never been used as a rover. He attributed his versatility to his extensive athletics background which provided him with speed, strength, and an exceptionally good leap. He represented both WA and Australia in junior athletics and held several national records in field events during the 1970’s including a u/14 world shot putt record which he held for 11 weeks. As a result of playing league football Hendriks was banned from athletics in 1976 as his amateur status was revoked for training and playing with players who were being paid.\n\nTeam success avoided West Perth and Hendriks for the remainder of his career with the team not winning another grand final until 1995. In 1982 (Dennis Cometti’s first year as coach) West Perth lost the preliminary final to Claremont and it felt like an opportunity missed as we had previously beaten the eventual grand final winners, Swan Districts, twice during the regular season. Unfortunately, we struggled against Claremont all year. Cometti returned Hendriks to his half back flank for most of the season and this resulted in what became Geoff’s best season for West Perth. He finished 5th in the Breckler Medal and was only behind Peter Murnane in Sandover medal votes for West Perth players. He was rewarded with selection in the WA State Squad, but sustained ankle ligament damages the week before and was unable to play.\n\nWhile Hendriks enjoyed a serviceable career over his 11 seasons, his fondest memories are playing alongside some of the legends of the game. Whinnen, Dempsey, Watling, Fong, Menaglio, plus many other stars of the team. “I only have wonderful memories of my playing days at West Perth, and it was a privilege to play in a great club,” said Geoff. The ‘bush boys’ in John Duckworth and Geoff Taylor ensured that every player was made to feel welcome. They were the good old days.\n\nGeoff became the youngest life member of the club and holds this accolade in high regard. By the time of his retirement after the 1985 season, Hendriks had played 170 senior games for West Perth and kicked 112 goals. This included two games in the NFL Night Series in 1977–78 and five in the AFC Night Series in 1979–81, against interstate teams like North Adelaide, Glenelg, South Melbourne, Hawthorn, and North Melbourne.\n\nAfter retiring from football Hendriks became the principal of St Patrick's Catholic School Katanning and later Sacred Heart Thornlie. He then took up the position of Director of Business at Bindoon Agricultural College Bindoon.\n\nGeoff has been the Sydney Swans WA talent scout for 6 years. Since retiring in 2022, Geoff has joined the WPFC Heritage committee.\n\n16. Kathleen Tompsitt - Volunteer\n\nI started going to the footy to watch West Perth with my parents in the 1940s. Now 80 years on l can say that l have not missed many games.\n\nDuring the 1950s the weekend was taken up with watching footy. Saturday we would watch the Cardies League and Reserves, Sunday would be 3rds and 4th because my brother played in both these teams.\n\nMy best memory was the 1975 Grand Final day. We queued in line from 5am at Subiaco to attend the grand final, and it was worth it.\n\nBack in the good old days we knew a lot of players because they lived in or around Osborne Park.\n\nEach year I would pick my favorite player. My brother and I had scrap books, and we would fight over the photos in the Sunday Times, the West Australian and the Westside.\n\nI started as a volunteer in the 80’s with Val Hasler, Mrs. Nelson, and a couple of others making sandwiches for the players at Leederville Oval. We continued to do so at Joondalup Arena. We did this for a few years then the club decided to cancel the sandwiches.\n\nSometime later Raelene Trewhella, Toni Bell and I took over the meat and vegies raffle. In 2021 the raffle was discontinued due to my age and the club could not find anyone to help with the shopping. It is a shame I could not continue because I did make a fair amount of money for the club which went towards buying players equipment - mainly exercise bikes, a cold tub, and I think there was a washing machine.\n\nFor many years I helped Ross McMillan with the little league. This included transporting the gear for Ross and setting it up. I even did some time keeping.\n\nI enjoyed myself as a volunteer.\n\n17. Joe Barron\n\nJoe Barron born 6th December 1924, was destined to be one of the longest serving supporters, workers, volunteers and all-round handy man for the West Perth Football Club. Joe was made a life member of the club in their centenary year of 1985; he is one of West Perth longest serving behind the scenes men that every club needs.\n\nJoe married Dorothy and they had 6 children, Ray, Kay, Lynnette, Charlie, Rosemary and Geoffrey. Their early family years were tough times with the Barron’s living in a caravan and building their home in 18 Dover Rd, Scarborough.\n\nRay the oldest of the children was playing football with Scarborough juniors in theSubiaco zone, Joe would not agree for Ray to play with Subiaco and wanted him to play for his team West Perth. Joe applied for a transfer for Ray to play with West Perth, which was refused by Basil Fuller at the time. The Baron’s moved out of Scarborough and purchased a house in June 1966 in No1 Leicester Street Leederville. This is where Joe’s love affair with West Perth Football Club took off and entertained him until he retired from all football commitments in 1998.\n\nFrom a supporter in 1946, property assistant to Syd Gardiner in 1973, to property manager from 1978 to 1998, Joe has seen the great players, has memories of premierships in 1949, 1951, 1960, 1969, 1971, 1975, 1995 and 1999. His greatest player and friend were Number 12 Bill Dempsey, Joe would regularly have Bill home for a meal for family support and encouragement. He would celebrate a bottle of Dempsey port after every premiership. Joe also recalls the other great players of Graham Farmer, Mel Whinnen, Peter Steward, Les Fong and John Duckworth. Joe however dubs former champion all-rounder Fred Buttsworth as the greatest player he has seen.\n\nJoe was a dedicated property manager but offered more, he would cook breakfast for the players on a Sunday morning, plus make soup available on training nights. As property manager Joe treated all the club football gear as his own. No player was allowed more than two pair of socks and always had to return the game day jumper that Joe and Dorothy would wash and dry. Joe admits that there were a few jumpers go missing, which he would for ever be chasing. He held expectation of seeing some of those jumpers return, when the historic last game at Leederville was played on Sunday 22nd August 1993.\n\nJoe retired from full time plumbing in 1980 so he could give more time to the football club. Joe was known as a one-eyed supporter and always got the jokes with having one lazy eye. People loved Joe as the friend of West Perth, always with a cigarette in hand, a story to tell and a glass of brandy when the day was done. Joe served on the committee and also the Past Players and Officials committee.\n\nThe move from Leederville to Joondalup did not stop Joe, he sold the family home in Leederville and purchased 18 Utah Grove Joondalup, a 4-minute drive to Joondalup Sports Centre now known as Pentanet Stadium. Joe continued as Property Manager until he retired in 1998 due to health issues. He was the cleaner at Joondalup for $10/hour for the first 5 years at Joondalup.\n\nJoe Barron was awarded the Australian Sports Medal in December 2000, from her Majesty the Queen for service to Australian Rules Football, 1946 to 2000.\n\nProperty Managers are not made, they are just born to serve. Whichever football club you relate to you will see the same person. Loyal, hardworking, dedicated to their club and their duties, gives nothing away and treats the property of the club as their own. Football clubs cannot function without the Joe Barrons of this world.\n\nJoe Barron a deserving life member who gave his life to the West Perth Football Club.\n\nJoe Barron (6/12/1924 – 13/5/2013)\n\nMaintenance Man, Plumber, Doorman, Assistant Property Manager, Property Manager, Commmittee Man, Past Players & Officials Committee, Cleaner\n\n18. Jim Craig - Player\n\nJim Craig, West Perth’s third Sandover Medallist (1927), was renowned as a rugged and fearless defender for opponents to get past in his celebrated career. Jim earned the nickname, ‘The Rock of Gibraltar’. He endured tough games on the footy field, which also mirrored his hard circumstances in his early life.\n\nJim Craig’s daughter, Mrs Maureen Jarvis, recalled that her Dad, a fitter by trade, lost his own Mum, Grace, when he was aged 17, eventually living with his cousin, Jim Gosnell, West Perth’s 1927 Sandover Medallist. After losing his job at the time when the worsening economy was about to bite, far harder around the world, Jim had to find work where opportunities allowed. One such job was helping with building a new fence at Leederville football oval.\n\nJim Craig started playing in 1918 and amassed 203 games over 14 years at West Perth. Jim earned a reputation as one of the era’s finest centre-half backs. He represented WA in state football an impressive 18 times, this took Jim to the many places, such as Hobart and Melbourne. Jim played in the Australian National Carnival in Hobart in 1924. He was one of five West Perth players with Jim playing in the famous half back line of Boyd, Craig, and Gosnell. Maureen recalled her dad saying the harder Victorian surfaces caused soreness and plenty of ‘corkies’. Of interest also was her reminisce that Jim ruefully confided that he and some teammates were relieved of their money playing cards during a trip away, by of all people, teammate, and Cousin Jim Gosnell- a card shark, as Jim Craig described!\n\nMaureen recounted a fascinating story about her dad. He never owned a car, preferring to ride a bike, or catch the train for work. Amazingly, this is how he found out about becoming a Sandover Medallist in 1927, when on the morning train, a fellow passenger inquired “hey Jim, do you know you won the Sandover last night?” How times have changed! When talking about her dad’s time in the game, Maureen explained that boils were a constant irritation to Jim. He described to her that there were no showers in his day; instead, players cleaned off in big communal tubs of water. The heavy woollen guernseys worn in the era, combined with the clearly dubious hygiene of shared baths, caused Jim a problem or two in dealing with boils that developed on his body in these conditions.\n\nJim became the third captain selected in 1928 after Bill McRae and Harold Boyd stepped down. Jim retired in the pre-season of 1931 but came back and played later in the season. Upon retiring, Jim Craig stayed in touch with his beloved West Perth and footy in general, being a trainer at the Cardies for several years upon his retirement in 1931. When the Sandover Medal count changed to the occasion that we now know, Jim loved the night and attended regularly over the years, looking forward to the catch-up with old mates. Mrs Jarvis noted that the count in those days was strictly a men’s night, but as times and attitudes changes, wives could be invited. She remembers fondly the night she accompanied her Dad; this being after the passing of her Mum, Jim’s wife, Nellie. Maureen Jarvis would have been right at home amongst the footy banter of that evening. Maureen’ husband, Lyle Jarvis, was the nephew of East Fremantle champion Carlisle (Bub) Jarvis, their 1934 Lynn Medallist, six-time premiership player and eight-time state representative.\n\nJim Craig was wonderfully sure in the air and with his long kicks he transferred play time and time again. His was an exhibition that could hardly be faulted.\n\n19.Don Marinko Snr - Player\n\nDon Marinko was born on the Golden Mile at Kamballie on 27th August 1907. Don learnt the game of football at the Christian Brothers College in Perth. As a strapping 1.8 m (5ft 11in.) schoolboy he attracted the attention of Subiaco and made his league debut on 23rd June 1923 before turning 16. Starting in a forward pocket, he made a favourable impression, with The West Australian reporting that “a word of praise should be given to young Marinko who signalised his debut in league football with a fine mark and a good kick for a goal”.\n\nAfter two further appearances that season, he returned to the Goldfields to work underground on the Golden Mile and joined the Boulder City Football Club. He played in the 1924 and 1925 premierships and developed a significant reputation before being tempted into a second stint in league football.\n\nSeveral clubs sought his services, but after arranging to play for East Perth it was found that he was residentially bound to West, having inadvertently taken up residence in Osborne Park. East Perth’s loss was West Perth’s wonderful gain for in the subsequent 13 seasons he became a brilliant ruckman/forward and a key component of three premiership teams including two as captain.\n\nDon Marinko married and had two sons, Donald Anthony and Raymond George Marinko, both played WAFL football for West Perth in the 1950s. With Don being named Don Junior then when Don Jnr start playing for West Perth in 1952. Then, Don became Don senior. Don Marinko Jnr played 196 games for East Perth, West Perth, where Ray played 184 games for East Perth and West Perth.\n\nMarinko’s greatest assets were his pace and agility for a big man and his brilliant left-foot stab passing which was used to great effect in partnership with champion full-forward Ted Tyson. After Marinko’s death, Tyson credited about 500 of his 1197 goals to “Big Don”. “He was one of the best stab passes I’ve seen and hit his target 90% of the time. He had the ability to put perfect weight into his kick, either booting it hard when I was on a fast lead or softly when I managed to break clear on my own”. Contemporary newspaper accounts were equally eulogistic over a long period with the examples following:\n\n“Marinko is in wonderful form at present and is probably the best player in League ranks. He has dash, turns cleverly, possesses a sure pair of hands, and utilizes both the half distance pass and the long drop kick to advantage. His work in the ruck was superb and when placed in defence his value never diminished.” Westralian Worker 13 September 1929\n\n“Right out on his own was Marinko of West in the game at Leederville. His ruck work was of a very high standard, his marking very sure and spectacular and his passing of the ball ’a thing of beauty and joy forever’. He is a champion and his selection as a Carnavalian simply a matter of course “WA Footballer” 15 July 1933\n\nMarinko maintained a very high standard of play over a long career and represented Western Australia 13 times between 1928 and 1936 often being among the best. After retirement in 1939 he was proud to see his two sons Don and Ray enjoy long careers in League football before their father passed away from a sudden heart attack in 1967. Selected on the half-forward line in West Perth’s “Team of the Century” in 2000, Don Marinko Snr was one of West Perth’s most influential players in a golden era. His style was equally as attractive as it was effective, and he becomes a very worthy member of the WA Football Hall of Fame.\n\nAmong the many champion footballers to emerge from the Goldfields, by no means the least is West Perth champion ruckman and half-forward Don Marinko Snr, who in a 17-year career established a reputation as not only one of the greatest players of his era, but also one of the most stylish to behold.\n\nMarinko died in 1967 from a heart attack. He was named in West Perth's Team of the Century in October 2000, and was inducted into the West Australian Football Hall of Fame in March 2011.\n\n20. Ted Tyson - Player\n\nEDWARD (TED) ARTHUR TYSON, Ted Tyson was born in Kalgoorlie on 4th February 1910 and died in Hamersley on 5th February 1996.\n\nTed was born into a talented football family. His father – Sam Tyson – played 60 games for West Perth (1921- 1925, & 1927). His uncle – Tony Tyson – played 108 games for Perth (1913 – 1919) and 55 games for West Perth (1920 – 1924) and kicked 22 goals. Ted’s cousin Charlie Tyson Jnr played 106 games for Collingwood and 38 games for North Melbourne. His uncle Charlie Tyson Snr played 17 games for East Fremantle. Ted’s brother in- law was well known state cricketer Laurie Bandy.\n\nTed was only 177 centimetres tall and a right footer, but very adept with his left. He debuted in 1930 kicking over 50 goals in his first year. Ted was West Perth’s leading goal kicker from 1931 until 1941. He kicked a career total of 1196 in 228 games at West Perth averaging over 5 goals a game, and was only goalless in 3 games.\n\nIn 1931 Ted kicked 81 goals and in 1932 booted 96 goals including 8 in the Grand Final. He kicked over a 100 goals 4 times and played in 4 winning Grand Finals (1932, 1934, 1935 & 1941). In 1940 Ted kicked 60 goals before his season ended with appendicitis. Ted returned in 1942 but retired due to WW2. He was the leading goalkicker in 1938 with 126 goals which was remarkable as West Perth had fallen to last on the ladder. The last game of that year was remembered because Ted kicked 17.5 in a losing team total of 18.7. This is still the most goals kicked by an individual in a losing side in senior Australian Rules.\n\nTed played 4 interstate matches in 1933, kicking 13 goals and was often overlooked for East Fremantle’s George Doig who was also a prolific goal scorer at that time.\n\nTed is the full forward in West Perth’s team of the century 1900 – 2000. He was inducted into the WA Football Hall of Fame in 2004. In 2022 Ted was an inaugural member of the Australian Hall of Fame. Ted had a remarkable career and was the leading WAFL goal kicker until taken over by Austen Robertson Jnr.\n\n21. Max Tetley - Player\n\nMaxwell Joseph Tetley was born in Fremantle on 22nd April 1909, and played his early football for North Fremantle in the suburban competition. He came under notice by officials from the East Fremantle Football Club and was invited to their training sessions, and in 1930 played for them in a challenge match in Kalgoorlie against the Goldfields Football League.\n\nHowever, in 1931 Max began employment with Betts & Betts shoe store in Hay Street, Perth. The store was opened in 1912 by the Breckler family and became the largest shoe store in the country. Owner, Alec Breckler, was elected to the Presidency of the West Perth Football Club in 1930 and he was to have a significant influence on Max’s football career when he arranged to have him cleared from East Fremantle to the Cardinals.\n\nThis was indeed a coup, as Max was a ready-made footballer who lived up to all expectations by winning the trophy for the best first year player. To that time West Perth hadn’t won a premiership since 1905, and were left without success for 26 years, which stands as the longest in the club’s history, but all that changed in 1932.\n\nWith Max playing at full-back, and an influx of new players, together with distinguished Victorian Jack Cashman being appointed as coach in 1930, the Cardinals finished second on the ladder and went on to beat East Fremantle in the second semi-final by 18 points after being 19 points in arrears at three quarter time. In the grand final against East Perth, Max lined up on Mick Cronin, and after such a long premiership drought the Cardinals were in no mood to lose, running out winners by 43 points after kicking 6.2 in the final quarter, along with Ted Tyson’s 8 goals for the match. It would be 2002 before cross town rivals East Perth won a grand final against West Perth.\n\nThe success didn’t stop there for Max, he won the 1932 Breckler Medal, and held down the key positions at centre-half-back and full-back in the premierships in 1934, 1935, and later in 1941. He represented Western Australia 14 times and captained the state team 4 times and coached the state team. He was a strong defender, a long kick, and moved with style, and was an integral part of the club’s successes over that period.\n\nMax coached the Cardinals in 1938 and 1939, but due to a run of crippling injuries and many key player losses it wasn’t a great period for the club, only winning four games in those two years. He continued to play in 1940 under newly appointed coach Ross Hutchinson, and in 1941 considered retiring, but stayed on as full-back to help rebuild the team, and they went on to win an amazing grand final in which few expected them to succeed.\n\nDuring the WWII years Max was forced to retire because of the decision in 1942 to change the league into an under eighteen competition. Many players had enlisted in the armed services, and he didn’t return to football after the war, therefore after 210 games and eleven seasons with the Cardinals his remarkable career had come to an end.\n\nMax passed away on 9th February 1997 at age 87 and will be remembered as one of the great legends of West Perth Football Club and Australian Football, and testimony to that fact is his career statistics below.\n\n22. Checker O'Keefe - Player\n\nTerrence Bernard 'Ed' O'Keefe was born in Boulder on 14 May 1913.\n\nHe was also known by his nickname Checker and it’s still unknown where the name originated from. His family knew him as “Uncle Ted” of which is obviously short for Terrence.\n\nO’Keefe played his junior football as a defender with the Mt Hawthorn amateurs and represented the state.\n\nIn 1933 he commenced playing for West Perth.\n\nO'Keefe’s sister Eileen was married to Lal Mosey a member of the Swan Districts inaugural 1934 team. Both O’Keefe and Mosey wore the #3 guernsey for most of their playing careers.\n\nO'Keefe was a member of West Perth's 1934, 1935 and 1941 premiership sides. A versatile footballer that could play in both the ruck, and across half back. He was originally a half back until coach Johnny Leonard made a tactical move one Saturday when the team was struggling. The move paid off and he became the No. 1 ruckman.\n\nIn 1940 O’Keefe at the age of 27 won the Sandover Medal with 29 votes to beat his teammate Stan Pops Heal by four votes. Mosey jokingly claims that he helped O’Keefe win the medal. O’Keefe admitted that Heal, will be his main opponent on medal night. “As it turned out Swans were playing West Perth in that final game and Mosey played on Pops and didn’t give him a kick.”\n\nO'Keefe also won four Fairest and best awards for West Perth, with them coming in consecutive seasons from 1938 to 1941. During his career he represented Western Australia in six interstate matches.\n\nHe enlisted in the army July 5, 1942, and discharged on November 21, 1945, with the rank of private. He returned to playing for West Perth to 1946.\n\nOver O’Keefe’s working career he was an apprentice baker and drove the delivery truck for the brewery.\n\nAfter football his nephew Bob recalls Checker had a horse in the backyard of his residence in Victoria Street. He also lived in Cunderdin. He lived the remainder of his life upstairs at the Rosemount Hotel where he passed away on Christmas Eve 1986.\n\nIn 2000 Checker was named in the ruck for West Perth's official 'Team of the Century'.\n\nChecker was a kind and well-dressed, politically correct widower.“O’Keefe and his likeable grin will remain a fond memory amongst Cardinal supporters.\n\n23. Stan 'POPS' Heal - Player\n\nStan “Pops” Heal, was a great sportsman and a Politician. Born 30th July 1920, lived in Subiaco then moved to Kalgoorlie in 1932 with the family. Stan Heal was called “Pops” by his father at an early age and from then on, was always known as “Pops.”\n\nPops played junior football with Mt Hawthorn Mets and was recruited to West Perth in 1939. The Heals have grown a dynasty of footballers. Pops played 8 games with Melbourne and his older brother Jack played three games with Melbourne in 1942. Pops had three sons who all played in the WAFL – Graham (122 games), Stephen (136 games) and Laurie (154 games). Graham played in five losing games for North Melbourne in 1968.\n\nPacy, courageous and highly skilled, Stan 'Pops' Heal was one of Australia's finest wingmen of the 1940s. His WANFL career with West Perth comprised 180 games between 1939 and 1953, with a break for the war.\n\nThe West Perth teams of the half decade or so following World War II were among the finest in the club's history, and Pops Heal was very much a lynchpin, both as player and coach. He played in three premiership sides for the Cardinals and won their fairest and best award in 1947. He coached the victorious Grand Final teams of 1949 against Perth and 1951 against South Fremantle.\n\nHeal joined the navy in 1941 and was stationed in Fremantle until July and was able to get weekends off, to play for West Perth.\n\nSTAN \"Pops'' Heal will be remembered for his unique feat in 1941, when he played in two premiership teams in different states as a 21-year-old. Whilst temporarily stationed in Victoria, Pops lined up with Melbourne, and played on the wing, as the Redleg’s defeated Essendon in the 1941 VFL Grand Final. He then travelled back to Perth by train, after the Melbourne premiership, arriving in time to play in the WANFL Grand Final with West Perth. West Perth beat East Fremantle 14.14:98 to 10.17:77, completing the second half of a remarkable double premiership in the one year.\n\nHeal played 180 games for West Perth between 1939 and 1953, he coached the then Cardinals for 6 years, from 1947 to 1952, which remained the club's longest coaching term until Bill Monaghan completed 10 years in 2018. Pops coached West Perth to two premierships in 1949 and 1951. He was beaten in the Grand Final by South Fremantle in 1947, 1948 and 1952, and by Perth in preliminary final in 1950. Pops coaching record is second none by him achieving 96 wins in 132 matches, a 70% record. Pops played a total of 18 state games for Western Australia, winning a Simpson Medal for his performance in a game against South Australia in 1949 and captaining his state at the 1950 Brisbane Carnival. He was named twice in the All-Australian team (1948 and 1949).\n\nHe has been named on the wing in both the WAFL and West Perth teams of the century. He is a Legend in the WAFL Hall of Fame.\n\nPops worked for the PMG as a linesman. in 1953 he was elected as the Labor member of the Western Australian Legislative Assembly, representing the seat of West Perth. Then in 1962 he moved to the prestigious seat of Perth, holding that seat until he retired from politics in 1965.\n\nPops was a member of the Licencing Court and collaborated with several prominent businessmen.\n\nPops kept close friends with John Loughridge, Neil Garland, Bruce Bridges and Billy Kingsbury.\n\nHeal was inducted into the Australian Football Hall of Fame in 2010. He died on 15 December 2010.\n\nHis son and fellow West Perth great, Laurie Heal, told The West Australian, that the honour had been a timely boost in recent times of Pops poor health. Laurie joked that his father had stuck tight to the news of his induction for several weeks.\n\n\"The funny thing was that he never told us for a few weeks because they told him he couldn't tell anyone,\" Laurie said of his father, who has eight grandchildren and five great-grandchildren.\n\n\"It was only about three weeks after he'd been told that he came around one night and handed over a letter which said he'd been inducted. He was still telling us not to tell anyone because he'd been sworn to secrecy.\n\n\"I don't think Dad ever expected it, but it's a great honour at this time of his life. To be coming up to 90 and to be recognised, he's humbled and pretty excited by it.\n\n\"He thought it might have passed him by, so it's fantastic for him.\"\n\n24. Fred Buttsworth - Player\n\nFREDERICK JAMES (FRED) BUTTSWORTH, Born 29th May 1927 to Frederick Richard Buttsworth and Lillian Frances (nee Cameron) in North Perth.\n\nHis mother being catholic enrolled him in Sacred Heart Convent to start his education.\n\nHe was frightened by the dark habits the nuns wore; quite often, when his mother returned home, Fred was waiting on the front doorstep for her return. He eventually attended North Perth Primary School and later his secondary education at Perth Boys School.\n\nIt was here that his sporting prowess came to attention, winning High Jump Competitions and in playing both Football and Cricket to a high standard. Lessons bored him and he left school at 14.\n\nDuring the war years league football was cancelled, as we know it and a combined competition was played between Clubs. He won his first league grand final at West Perth in 1942 aged 14.\n\nIn 1944 he was appointed captain of West Perth. He won the Fairest and Best and was the Clubs leading goalkicker with 78 goals. He played at Centre Half Forward and was runner up in the Sandover Medal.\n\nIn 1945 he joined the Navy going to Flinders Naval Base near Sydney for his 6-month training course and he was there when the war ended. He was then posted to Port Melbourne, Victoria and joined the Essendon Football Club where he played 8 games (kicked 9 goals) alongside his brother Wally. Wally became a legend at the Essendon Football Club playing many games and becoming a member of Essendon's Team of The Century. Wally had also played at West Perth before moving to Melbourne.\n\nWhilst in the Navy, Fred served on board HMAS Australia and the troop carrier Menora. This latter vessel was tasked transferring Australian troops to near Hiroshima, Japan who were part of the Occupational Forces. This vessel returned to Australia via Fremantle and it was here on May 15th 1947 he received his discharge papers.\n\nHe returned to West Perth and gained employment with Postmaster Generals Department at Perth Post Office.\n\nFred also excelled at cricket playing 14 seasons at North Perth Cricket Club scoring 6434 runs at an average of 36.76 with 13 centuries. This form saw him selected for Western Australia in their inaugural Sheffield Shield season 1947/1948. He played 8 matched for WA, scoring 343 runs at an average of 22.86. He also was a member of the first ever Sheffield Shield winning team for Western Australia.\n\nFred’s brother Brian, played 1 game for West Perth but preferred cricket and he also played at North Perth Cricket Club.\n\nFred left the Post Office and joined a clothing manufacturer, Mercia Modes where his job was delivering clothes to shops around Perth. It was here he met his future wife Vilma Bowra.\n\nIn 1949 he won a premiership with West Perth.1951 was a memorable year for Fred and the West Perth Football Club. For the fifth successive year he was selected to play for WA. In one match in a losing side to Victoria his performance won him a Simpson Medal from a half back flank. Newspaper headlines at the time printed \"BUTTSWORTH v VICTORIA\".\n\nAlso, in 1951 Fred won the very first \"Daily News 50 pound Footballer of the Year Award.\"\n\nWest Perth again won the premiership (both in league and reserves).\" Winning the special Federation Jubilee Cup. Fred won West Perth's Fairest and Best and to cap of a stellar season he also won the Sandover Medal.\n\nIn 1953 he only played 10 games due to a torn thigh muscle injury. It never healed properly and thus saw the end of Fred's football career at the age of 26. He did however continue his cricket career at North Perth, captaining them to premierships in 1957/58 and 1958/59.\n\nIn 1950 he had begun working for the Department of Civil Aviation. In 1959 he spent 2 years on the Cocos Islands.\n\nHe again went back for another 2 year stint in 1965 this time with the whole family. He retired in 1989 after spending nearly 39 years with the department.\n\nIn total Fred had an amazing sporting career winning many accolades along the way.\n\nPresented with the Australian Sports Medal 2000 in that year as an outstanding Sheffield Shield performer for cricket.\n\nFred passed away on May 11th 2021 (aged 93). He is survived by daughters Lee and Dale and sons Gary and Ray.\n\n25. Wally Price - Player\n\nWalter John \"Wally\" Price (born 2 June 1926) in Margaret River, was a wonderful legend who played for the West Perth Football Club. He was married to Wynne for 66 years and had five wonderful children and many grandchildren and great-grandchildren. He passed away at the ripe old age of 95 years.\n\nWally’s older brother, Henry (Harry), also played 56 games, 2 for West Perth and 53 games for Claremont. A younger brother David played 40 games for West Perth. Originally growing up in York Wally started playing in the Metropolitan Junior Football Association (MJFA).\n\nWally worked as a boilermaker with the Government Railways, with work, football, and his family, he was too busy to pay much attention to other sports at which he has shone. For two years (1945-46) he was senior belt and senior surf champion of the Scarborough Surf Club and as a second-grade cricketer with East Perth. He scored enough 50s to merit a few first-grade game.\n\nWally Price debuted for West Perth in the age-restricted war-time competition in 1942, at the age of 16, and played in a premiership in his first season. Fred Buttsworth also debuted at the age of 14 years.\n\nIn 1941 it had been a difficult year for the WAFL due to the World War, with many clubs losing many players to the war effort. The League introduced a rule that only players who turned 18 at October 1942 could play. This meant some great stars of the era – like Bill Rainoldi, Norm McDiarmid and Max Tetley had to retire.\n\nHe immediately assumed the back pocket position and although only small in stature, he had pace and a delightful long clearing dropkick. He was also a superb reader of the play and played his opposing resting rovers so closely that they seldom caused scoreboard damage whilst on him. Although tough and resolute his methods were very fair and he rarely gave away a free kick.\n\nThe 1942 West Perth side coached by Joe Brooker (who was the father of Dolores and who later became the father-in-law of the late Ronnie Bewick and grandfather of all the sons Cory, Darren, Rich and Glen who all also played for WP), contained many future stars including Len Harman and Fred Buttsworth, and Wally occupied the left back pocket position in both the 1942 Second Semi and Grand Final victories.\n\nThe following year Ray (Homer) Schofield commenced with the club and he and Price developed a near perfect understanding in the last line of defence that was to last for over 10 seasons in both WAFL and state football.\n\nPrice’s ground play and anticipation were a great foil for Schofield’s strong spoiling tactics and the pair went on to represent Western Australia on 12 occasions together between 1947 and 1953.\n\nWally made his interstate debut for Western Australia at the 1947 Australian National Football Carnival, held in Hobart and then also played in the 1953 Carnival, held in Adelaide.\n\nPrice celebrated a second premiership success in 1949 but the 1951 Grand Final was his finest moment.\n\nWest Perth took a 17-point lead into the final quarter, but the defence had to withstand a barrage of attacks by South Fremantle kicking with the aid of a strong breeze. The difference was down to 3 points with 2 minutes remaining and the Sunday Times reported that “Price, who had defended stoutly all day, and Schofield were remarkably cool under fierce pressure and won the game for the Cardinals”.\n\nAlthough Don (Mary) Porter won the Simpson Medal, the performance of Price and Schofield in the hectic final minutes of that game will long be remembered by West Perth faithful. Wally wryly reckons he should have won the Simpson.\n\nWally missed only 15 games in his 12 years of league football, which is an amazing record. Wally had only three real injuries in his football career, which have been entirely his own fault. Though normally a most reliable kick, he has unaccountably lapsed on several occasions and kicked the ground while doing the drop-kick. Three injured ankles have been the result.\n\nIn 1952 Wally Price won West Perth’s Fairest and Best award, the Breckler medal, ahead of a champion field but the club lost the Grand Final against the outstanding South Fremantle team.\n\nWally played in 8 Grand Finals (1942,1946, 1947, 1948, 1949, 1951, 1952, 1953) winning three premierships (1942, 1949, 1951).\n\nThe unsung position of back pocket specialist is never likely to produce a Sandover Medallist, but Wally Price was one of the best of many fine WA players to fill this vital defensive role. He was so effective at curbing the star rovers of his time. A compact 5ft 8in and 11st 4lb, Price has the happy knack of altering his game to suit the occasion. He prefers the game to be fast and open, but he is perhaps even more ruthlessly efficient when the occasion is a big one and the consequent tenseness leads to rugged, hard bumping passages.\n\nAt the end of the 1954 season at the age of 28, Price retired from the WAFL to accept the position of captain coach of the Griffith Football Club in New South Wales.\n\nHe held the West Perth club record of 256 games and but for this coaching opportunity he may well have become the first WAFL player to play 300 league games.\n\nHe was later appointed coach of the West Perth reserves team (1958 and 1959) and in 1960 joined the WAFL umpiring panel serving for four years umpiring mainly country matches.\n\nIn the 1960’s Wally Price was instrumental in the formation of the prestigious WA 200 Club and remained a regular attendee at West Perth matches.\n\nHe was unanimously selected in the back pocket in West Perth’s Team of the Century in the year 2000 and his effectiveness was recalled by Mick Cronin in the Daily News in 1967, “Wally Price tops the poll in my book as the greatest back pocket specialist. He had all the essential qualities of a good footballer. Most notable were his ability to read the play and his beautiful clearing kick which invariably turned defence into attack.”\n\nHe was named the Club’s Ball Legend in 2005 and inducted into the West Australian Football Hall of Fame in March 2010.\n\nWally’s service to our club extended well beyond his playing days. He was coach of the Reserves team in 1958 and 1959 and joined the West Perth committee of management (board) in 1964. Until recently, Wally was a regular supporter at our games. In more recent times Wally was unable to get to the football as often as he would have liked, but he continued to follow the fortunes of our club and those of the player group with great interest.\n\nWally passed away on the 17th of June. He will be deeply missed.\n\n26. Ray Schofield - Player\n\nRAYMOND JOHN “HOMER” SCHOFIELD was born at King Edward Memorial Hospital in Subiaco to Charles and Lilian Amelia (nee Johnson) Schofield, on 1/8/1925. He was one of seven children, the others being Arthur, Charles Jnr, Ken (Mick), Sue, Winifred, and Trevor.\n\nHis early days were spent in West Perth where he attended both Thomas St. Primary School, Thomas St., West Perth and CBC Leederville, Oxford St., Leederville.\n\nHe left school at the age 14 and joined his brother at Vinegar Brewery, Golding St., West Perth. The company later moved to Price St., Wembley. He remained with this company until retirement.\n\nHe married Valma (nee McNamara) Schofield, and they had 2 children Kevin and Marilyn.\n\nThey lived in Joondanna for many years before moving to Mandurah after retirement.\n\nRay began his football career as a full-forward in the wartime in the under 19 competition and headed the WANFL Competition in 1943 (93 goals). This wartime competition is not recognised in some sources.\n\nIn 1944-1945 he did not play due to service with Royal Australian Air Force in World War 2.\n\nHe made his senior WANFL debut in 1946. Played as a forward in the losing 1947 grand final.\n\nCoach Stan “Pops” Heal eventually moved him to full-back where he excelled over the next decade.\n\nAs full-back he was West Perth best and fairest five times 1948,1950,1953,1954 and1955. He played in West Perth premierships in 1949 and 1951. His battles with South Fremantle full-forward Bernie Naylor were memorable just by themselves. Towards the end of his career, he returned to the forward line and was West Perth leading goalkicker in 1957. He became captain coach in 1958.\n\nIn his final season of 1958 in round 10 he played his 248th game to become WA elite football career games record holder. He then became the first elite football player to play 250 games.\n\nHe retired with 259 games and 169 goals to his record. These figures exclude the 18 games and 93 goals in the 1943 underage competition. Thus, his total games for West Perth is 277 games with 262 goals.\n\nRay also played 22 interstate football matches for WA including the 1950 Brisbane and 1953 Adelaide Carnivals.\n\nHe was selected as full-back in West Perth’s official “Team of the Century” and in 2004 was one of the inaugural inductees in the WA Football Hall of Fame.\n\nHis brother Trevor Schofield also played for West Perth (147 games) and Claremont (18 games).\n\nAfter West Perth he played a few seasons in Sunday League before returning to West Perth in 1963 as a trainer alongside his old friend Roy Ennis. He did this every training night and every game until 1990.\n\nEven after retiring to Mandurah, he would regularly catch the train to Joondalup to watch his beloved Cardinals/Falcons.\n\nRay passed away on 23/12/2017, at the Age of 92.\n\n27. Ray Scott - Player\n\nRaymond Cyril Scott was born on 17th April 1927, and made his debut for West Perth in 1944 when the WANFL replaced the league with an underage competition during WWII. This was introduced because many league players over the age of eighteen years had joined the armed services, therefore making it difficult for clubs to field a consistent team.\n\nDuring this time, Ray played as a ruckman or at centre-half-back and showed great promise. He then enlisted in the Royal Australian Navy in 1945 and didn’t re-join West Perth until 1947. Ray Schofield had been a dominant full-forward in the underage competition, and in the first game of 1947 kicked 8 goals against East Perth, but during the season, coach Stan ‘Pops’ Heal replaced him at full-forward with Ray Scott and moved Schofield to full-back. Both players went on to be champions in their respective positions, and became legends at West Perth, WANFL, and Western Australian football.\n\nOther than Ted Tyson (1930-1941, 1945), there has been no finer full-forward than Ray Scott to pull on the red and blue jumper. From 1948 he topped the Cardinals goal kicking on eight consecutive occasions, and if his career had not coincided with champion South Fremantle full-forward Bernie Naylor’s, he would no doubt have been the premier full-forward of that era. Naylor was the leading goalkicker six times during 1946-1948 and 1952-1954, but Ray stole the award from Bernie in 1951 by kicking 141 goals for the season, and again won the award in 1955 with 83 goals. 1952 turned out to be an amazing season for these two remarkable full forwards, Ray was leading Naylor by 3 goals with three games to play. In the third last game Ray kicked 11.5, but in the Fremantle derby, Naylor booted 19.1 out of South Fremantle’s total of 24.9 to take the lead. In the final two matches Ray kicked 14 goals, but Naylor kicked 18, and won the goal kicking honors by 9 goals.\n\nIn 1954, on the Monday before the preliminary final against South Fremantle, Ray was working on the new extensions to the Royal Perth Hospital when he fell from the ninth floor. Fortunately, he landed on the roof of a construction lift which saved his life, but his injuries prevented him from playing in the final, which South went on to win by 24 points. Missing Ray’s presence and goal front accuracy was a huge blow to the Cardinals, and this was evident in the final quarter, when they had to make up a deficit of 9 goals, and fought back hard, but their inaccuracy cost them dearly kicking 4.14.\n\nIn 1955 Ray was appointed playing coach of Turvey Park Football Club in the New South Wales Southwest League and played and coached in the Riverina region until 1959, then returned to Western Australia and played just two more games for the Cardinals.\n\nAt 33 years of age Ray’s attention turned to umpiring, and in 1961 he umpired his first league game, followed by his first Grand Final in 1963. His rapid rise saw him appointed as umpire for the interstate clash between South Australia and Victoria in 1964, and he later officiated at the 1967 and 1968 WANFL Grand Finals. Ray’s style so impressed the Australian National Football Council that they requested him to umpire the game between Western Australia and Victoria at Subiaco Oval in 1968, which was at that time unusual, because the umpires were normally selected from a neutral state. Ray retired from field umpiring in 1970, but continued as umpire’s coach, and in 1977 went on to be the WANFL Umpires Advisor. Later, in 1981 and 1982, he was elected as Chairman of the Umpires Appointment Board. Ray passed away in January 2003 at age 75.\n\nThe following statistics show that Ray Scott was dedicated and devoted to West Perth, and to Australian Rules Football. His on-field accomplishments are the hall marks of a champion, and he takes his place as one of the legends of our game.\n\n28. Brian Foley - Player\n\nTimothy Brian Foley (Blue) is a true legend of the game who commenced his career at West Perth in 1954. His story is one of perseverance as he struggled with his size and awkwardness in the early years playing in the Reserves. He made his debut in 1954 and gradually grew into his body to become one of the true great ruckman of his era.\n\nMaking up in dogged persistence for what he may have lacked in raw talent, Foley gave as good as he got against the likes of Polly Farmer, Jack Clarke, Merv McIntosh, and Keith Slater. All these adversaries had decorated careers and represented WA on multiple occasions. The fact that Foley made no fewer than 22 interstate appearances for Western Australia in an era when the state was blessed with considerable ruck strength is perhaps the most persuasive testimony as to his prowess, as well as to the esteem in which he was held.\n\nFrom an individual perspective, Brian’s career went from strength to strength winning the Cardinals fairest and best trophy in 1957 and 1959. The highlight of Brian Foley’s illustrious 202-game league career came in 1959 when he was a runaway winner of the Sandover Medal winning by 10 votes (under the old 3-2-1 voting system. Brian also won every other award that year including WA Sportsman of the Year, Daily News and West Australian footballer of the year and the highly coveted Pelasco Oscar Award voted by opposition players. It was also the first season that he had been able to train regularly as he had previously worked in Northam.\n\nFrom a team perspective, 1960 provided many highlights for Brian. He assumed the captaincy from Don Marinko five games into the season and remained captain until the end of 1964. More importantly, he led West Perth to victory in the 1960 grand final. The Cardinals defeated arch-rivals East Perth by 32 points and Foley was one of the most conspicuous performers on the ground, kicking three goals and winning the Simpson Medal for being the best player afield.\n\nGiven that he was playing at a time when VFL clubs were beginning to make significant inroads into Western Australia’s vast pool of playing talent it was inevitable that Foley should become a prime recruiting target. North Melbourne came closer than anyone to procuring him - Foley even signed a form four - but the Cardinals steadfastly refused to agree to a clearance.\n\nCaptain of West Perth from 1960 to 1964, Foley decided to play one last season in 1965 after Bob Spargo took over as captain-coach. He finished on a ‘high’, performing consistently well all year, as well as leading the ruck in typically resolute fashion when Western Australia came from behind to defeat the VFL in a mid-season interstate clash at Subiaco Oval.\n\nOther accolades afforded Brian include induction into the WA Football Hall of Fame and also being named in the West Perth Team of the Century.\n\nThe Foley name lived on at West Perth with Brian’s son Dan debuting in 1980 and playing 58 games for West Perth prior to heading to Victoria where he played for Richmond from 1983 to 1985. also, is also the great uncle of current West Coast Eagles player, Luke Foley\n\n29.Brian France - Player\n\nBrian Leslie France (Puffer) is a true legend of the game who commenced his career at West Perth in 1958.\n\nBrian started playing football at Leederville State School and North Perth Under 16s and then moved to Mt Hawthorn Metropolitan Juniors and played two years in 1956 and 1957. Brian was invited down to try out at West Perth in 1958 with captain coach Ray Schofield in charge. Brian played most of the year with the seconds. Don Marinko was appointed coach of West Perth in 1959 after seven years of brilliant football as a centreman. The club had a great list of good footballers, however only finished in 5th place outside the four by two games. Don Marinko was replaced by Arthur Olliver in 1960 which produced one of West Perth greatest years by winning the Premiership. Brian started playing at full back, however he became the owner of centre half back and won many a contest together with fellow players Ken Ashdown and Ray Marinko. Brian was selected in the West Perth team of the century at Centre half back. Brian had many tough games against Mal Brown, Austin Robertson, and John Gerovich.\n\nBrian was affectionately known as ‘Puffer’, because of his habit of puffing up his cheeks when charging through packs in pursuit of the ball. Brian was an archetypal key position defender whose ambition every time he took the field was to keep his direct opponent kick less.\n\nThis was never better exemplified than during the 1966 Hobart carnival when Western Australia and the VFL met on the final day in what was effectively the championship decider. France was given the daunting job of minding Big V skipper Darrel Baldock, who had been in irrepressible form throughout the series, and for the better part of two quarters he almost literally wore ‘the Doc’ like an extra jumper. With their main route to goal blocked, the Vics looked uncharacteristically impotent, and the Sand gropers, five goals in front and playing superbly, seemed well on course for victory. Early in the third term, however, France was badly injured, and had to leave the ground, whereupon the hitherto unsighted Baldock immediately began to impose himself, enabling the Vics to eke out a 15-point win that at half time had looked distinctly improbable. Brian was named in the Australian Carnival team alongside teammates Mel Whinnen and Colin Hebbard.\n\nThe 1966 season ranks among France’s best even though he was runner-up to the dominant Bill Dempsey in the club Fairest and Best award. However, he was West Perth’s best-performer in the Sandover Medal, polling 18 votes to finish just behind roving greats Bill Walker (20 votes) and Barry Cable (19).\n\nThe next season saw him poll 18 Sandover Medal votes in the first 13 games to lead the count comfortably. But his career came to a premature end when he suffered a knee injury in round 14, with Bill Walker and John Parkinson gradually over-hauling him to share the Medal honours on 19 votes. Rival forwards regarded France as one of the toughest defenders in the game.\n\nExtremely strong and fast, he had the capacity to nullify some of the greatest forwards the game has seen, with a combination of leading the play, outstanding marking, and a close-checking style.\n\nNewspaper critics of that era often hailed France as the best key-position defender in Australia and certainly some rated him alongside the great South Fremantle centre-half-back Frank (Scanno) Jenkins, an inaugural member of the Hall of Fame. After another injury twelve months later, Brian France’s nine season, 159 game league career came to a premature end, although had the Cardinals allowed him the clearance, he desired to arch-rival’s East Perth it may have provided him with the incentive he needed to continue. The fact that France had still been playing football of the highest quality was emphasised when he finished just one vote adrift of joint winners John Parkinson and Bill Walker in the Sandover voting. Had he not missed seven matches through injury there seems little doubt that he would have secured the Medal, which would have been an appropriate way of sealing a distinguished career that also brought involvement in a premiership in 1960, two club fairest and best awards, and 17 interstate appearances.\n\nHis 1967 knee injury certainly brought a premature end to his career at the age of 27, with knee reconstructions an unknown treatment in those years.\n\n30. Mel Whinnen - Player\n\nMel Whinnen was the epitome of all things great, with the game of Australian Rules Football. Throughout his 18-season, 371-game league career, Mel’s name was synonymous with both fair play and brilliance, the dual attributes which collected votes for all the top awards in Australian football. He was modest, almost apologetic but brilliant in his on-field leadership and his off-field demeanour.\n\nMel commenced his prolific league career in 1960. Playing six games that year, which included him coming off the bench in the 1960 premiership win over East Perth. Mel was privileged to play in three more premierships in 1969, 1971 and again in 1975. Mel played an amazing 365 games over 18 years of league football at West Perth, an achievement that we will never see repeated. Mel finally retired after the end of the 1977 football season.\n\nWest Perth was the team Mel had followed from the age of 5 or 6 and he identifies his idols as Brian ‘Blue” Foley, Frank Margaria and Joe Fanchi. The fact that he was privileged to train and play with his idols was a fact that Mel still cherishes. It was every boy’s dream!\n\nThroughout his lengthy career, Mel proved to be a model of consistency supported by the numbers including 9 Breckler medals, 14 State games and accumulating 142 Sandover medal votes including two runners up finishes in 1964 and 1971. This vote tally is the highest by any player never to win a Sandover Medal. Indeed, it was arguably the fact that Whinnen could invariably be relied upon to perform at or near his best that distinguished him from the comparatively large group of players who warrant the description ‘good’ and made him instead a bona fide champion. He also won the Simpson Medal in 1975 for his best on ground performance in the grand final at the mature age of 33.\n\nConsistency was a hallmark of Mel’s career. He trained and played with a determination second to none. He was quick and elusive which earned him the nickname of “Slippery” and he lived up to that nickname for his entire career. There have been very few players to play the game who when surrounded by opposition players provide a quick hip fake, run a 360-degree circle, and leave his opponent stranded without the ball. Many a player, have tried this quite simple manoeuvre with no or catastrophic results. This was just one of the hallmarks of the brilliance of Mel Whinnen that added to his nickname “Slippery.”\n\nAlways a sublimely elegant footballer, it was appropriate when, in 1976, Whinnen became one of a select band of players to be awarded an MBE. Bill Dempsey who mirrored Mel’s career in successes and longevity also received an MBE at this time. He retired a year later after West Perth lost the 1977 Preliminary Final to East Fremantle. It is doubtful if Leederville was ever home to a more prodigious or engaging talented footballer.\n\nIn October 2000, Mel was named in the centre in West Perth's Team of the Century. Mel was an inaugural inductee of the West Australian Football Hall of Fame in March 2004. Mel had one of the entrance gates at Subiaco Oval named after him. The main grandstand at Arena Joondalup, West Perth's home ground since 1994, is named the Whinnen–Dempsey Stand. This is in honour of two of the greatest players' that have played for West Perth, the only two who have exceeded 300 games for the football club.\n\nMel had respect for all his coaches and acknowledges that they all contributed to his development over the years. He had a special respect for his premiership coaches who were able to extract the best out of each of the players. He states that Arthur Oliver was a commanding presence and very astute in his gamesmanship while Polly was the ultimate player who led by example and brought the team along with him. He attributes Graham Campbell (1975 premiership coach) as a great motivator and tactician which is supported by the fact that we had a couple of unbelievably bad losses during the year but never two in a row!\n\nWhinnen's contribution to our great game was acknowledged in 2018 when he was inducted into the Australian Football Hall of Fame.\n\nWhile the accolades for Mel Whinnen are overwhelming and fully deserved it would be remiss not to mention the wonderful support that he has received from his wife Dawn and his sons. They are his biggest supporters and provided the support and sacrifices that need to be made for a career to unfold.\n\n31. Bill Dempsey - Player\n\nJimmy Anderson was a brilliant footballer and sportsman in Darwin, and he was recruited by West Perth in 1960. We were playing for the Buffaloes Football Club in the Northern Territory Football League at the time, and it was Jack Larcombe, a great player for West Perth who was part of their 1942, 1949 and 1951 premierships who recommended I also come down to Perth with Jimmy. Arthur Oliver had just been appointed coach and had come from Footscray in the VFL after coaching there for seven years.\n\nMy feeling was that even though West Perth wanted me as a player, I was also there to accompany Jimmy and keep him from returning to Darwin. As for me, it was an exciting time and I just wanted to see what life was like away from Darwin. I would have gone to China to play ping-pong had I been asked.\n\nI seriously wanted to play basketball when I arrived in Perth, but I had made the commitment to play footy. Then one day Jimmy came to me and asked me to lend him a fair amount of money, which I did. He used it to go back home, and the footy club was frantically trying to contact him but he never came back, and years later when I caught up with him I asked why he took my dough and left me in the lurch. He said “You owe me, I knew you could make it in Perth, and if you had the money you would have followed me back to Darwin, so I’ve done you a big favour”. And he added, “That Simpson Medal you have at home really belongs to me”. How could I argue with that, so I just let it be. Jimmy was widely renowned as the ‘King’ in Darwin, a title he got from the Retta Dixon Mission where I met him. So being the ‘King’ you did what the ‘King’ requested, but there was truth in what he said, so thanks Jimmy, I do owe you. He sadly passed away in 2017 and I went to his funeral service which was so big they had to hold it at the Marrara Oval, the main stadium in Darwin.\n\nMel Whinnen (Winnie) and I started together at West Perth, but I sat on the bench for the first six games of 1960. I did all the warm-ups and never got on the ground. The rule then was unless an injured player had to be replaced you remained on the bench. Then on 28th May I got a run against Swan Districts at Leederville which we won by 39 points. I was so bloody nervous when I ran onto the ground in front of a 10,000 crowd, I still can’t recall who I played on, but it was a big thrill to be playing league footy at 18 years old. I was recruited as a centre-half-forward, but over 343 games I only played three games in that position.\n\nFinals time came around in 1960, and the League and Seconds (Reserves) made the Grand Final. I thought I might be a chance to play in the Grand Final, but the club had a lot of depth, so I played Seconds. I was so happy for Winnie when he got the nod to play in the league grand final, what a great moment for him at 17 years old. The Seconds had a wonderful win, and there was going to be great celebrations, but the league side buggered it up for us by winning their grand final which shifted the focus to them. Kidding, of course, it was a magic day and the league side were fantastic in beating East Perth who many pundits thought would win. The Reserves premiership was the last the club would see until 2014, a span of 54 years.\n\nThe club had its ups and downs after 1960, Clive Lewington coached for one year (1964), and Bob Spargo coached for the next three years until 1967. Then in a surprise announcement, the club appointed East Perth and Geelong great, Graham Polly Farmer, as playing coach in 1968.\n\nPolly completely changed the way we approached and played the game. The normal pre-season training sessions were thrown out the window, and it was nothing like we had ever experienced in any grade of football. At the beginning of pre-season training, and being a sticky-beak, I wanted to hear what Polly had to say, so I positioned myself near him and strength and running coach Bill DeGruchy. I overheard Bill say “how do you want me to run them Poll? Polly’s answer was, “Run ‘em till they spew, and make a note of any person who keeps running while they’re spewing”. I thought he was joking, but he wasn’t. The one thing that we all respected about Polly was that he didn’t issue instructions from the sidelines, he was in there with you, and never told anybody to do something that he wouldn’t do himself. He led by example, and we followed.\n\nWe were introduced to punching bags, which we would hold, while about 50 blokes took turns in charging full pelt at you. I used to hate it, but it gave us a hard edge, and Polly being a playing coach was never backward in coming down the ground during a game to hand out a verbal spray, so it goes without saying that he and I had a few run-ins from time to time. Polly was a perfectionist and expected the same from his players, it was his way or the highway, but he was a football genius which also earned him the respect of the players and the title of “the greatest player in the history of the game”.\n\nIn Polly’s first season in 1968, we were going really well and won 18 games, but for some unknown reason we were put out of grand final contention in straight sets, losing the second semi and preliminary finals. I can’t explain why that happened after being so dominant during the year. I can only put it down to just “one of those things” that happen in football when play doesn’t go your way.\n\nPolly hated losing, he was ruthless and always adopted a win at all costs approach, so the 1969 preseason training, and training during the year was intense. We won 16 games during the qualifying rounds and finished second, East Perth were on top. Polly was still simmering from the previous year’s loss, and absolutely adamant that this was not going to be a repeat of the 1968 finals series. It turned the 1969 second semi-final against East Perth into arguably the hardest hitting final ever seen in WAFL footy, and we won our way into the grand final by 26 points after a fierce contest. The 1969 grand final against East Perth turned out to be a very one-sided affair where all the hard work we had put in during the year paid off with a 73 point victory and laid to rest the disappointment of the previous year. I was fortunate enough to win the Simpson Medal, but it really belongs to the whole team who were just fantastic during the year and on the day, and to those who contributed during the season but missed the Grand Final team selection.\n\nBy far and away the biggest highlight and thrill for me from that day was my mum coming from Darwin to watch me play, courtesy of West Perth who flew her down, and I am eternally grateful to the club for that lovely gesture. It was just tremendous to have her there, as she had never been outside the Northern Territory before, with the exception being when Darwin was bombed by the Japanese and she was moved to South Australia while pregnant with me. Having her at the game was such an inspiration for me. I gave her my Simpson Medal, which to her friends she called it the ‘Simpson Desert Medal’. I said to her, “That’s not right, it’s the Simpson Medal”, to which she replied, “Be quiet, I know what I’m talking about”. My medal was lost during cyclone Tracy in 1974 which flattened Darwin, and my mum felt embarrassed about it. Later, two prospectors operating out of Andamooka in South Australia came across an object encrusted with dirt and clay, they chipped it away and it was my Simpson Medal. I took it to my mum, who was surprised, and she asked where it was found. I said, “The Simpson Desert”, she looked at me with a wry smile and said, “I told you it was the Simpson Desert Medal”. Believe it or not it’s a true story, and one that still gives me a spooky feeling.\n\nIt’s no secret that the move from Leederville to Joondalup has always been a sticking point with me. Leederville Oval will always be a sacred site to me with so many happy memories and great people. It’s where all my footy memories lie during my playing days, but wherever West Perth go, I go.\n\nI consider myself very privileged to have been able to play 343 games and captain the club I love, and been honoured with life membership, and to have represented the state 14 times and met so many great people from inside and outside the football world, it’s been a fantastic journey.\n\nNow, I’m not as mobile as I used to be, but I love this football club and the people in it, both past and present, for giving me the opportunities that have come my way. The bonds that have been forged over the years are still strong, and I go to the games as well as catch up with my team-mates and friends at the Cardinals Coffee Club every second Monday. The best thing that happened to me was coming to Perth and being part of the West Perth Football Club family. Long may it live. Up the Cardies!!\n\n32. Alan Watling - Player\n\nAlan Watling – Was the hard running link man for West Perth between 1969-1983, and a driving force in the club’s 9 finals appearances during that time, which included three premierships in 1969, 1971, 1975. His career spanned 15 seasons and 284 games. Alan played all his junior football with the Cardinals Football Club at Lake Monger oval, but due to the construction of the Mitchell Freeway the club had to move to Menzies Park in Mount Hawthorn, which was fortunately only a short walk from his home. His skills and versatility didn’t go unnoticed, and he received a letter from West Perth inviting him down to training.\n\nHe graduated to the Fourths under coach Geoff Hamel, and then to Thirds under Don ‘Mary’ Porter. In 1968 Alan was selected in the Thirds grand final side to play East Perth but came down with a severe bout of influenza and couldn’t take part. The team went on to win the club’s first ever Third’s premiership by 5 points. In 1969 Don Porter urged coach Graham ‘Polly’ Farmer to give Alan a league game, and in an intraclub scratch match Alan, playing as a half forward, impressed by kicking four goals in half a game.\n\nThe following week, VFL club North Melbourne arrived in Perth to play West Perth in a pre-season match. Alan was selected to unofficially play his first league game on a half-forward-flank and lined up on Denis Pagan who later coached North Melbourne to premierships in 1996 and 1999. Alan’s skills, stamina and accurate disposal were a feature, and he excelled by kicking two goals and was named West Perth’s best player. At the next weeks training session after the North Melbourne game, Alan broke his hand, and missed the first four weeks of the 1969 season, and then spent three weeks in the reserves building his match fitness. On 24th May, and 31st May 1969 he was selected in the league side starting on the bench, but on both occasions only had about 10 minutes match time in the final quarters. The next week on 7 th June 1969 was Alan’s lucky day. He was destined to play reserves because the league team was a strong combination despite the absence of captain/coach Graham Farmer and David Dyson who were away with the State team for the Australian Football Carnival in Adelaide.\n\nIn Farmer’s absence Mel Whinnen was appointed interim coach. During the week, John Wynne received a call-up to replace an injured player in the WA carnival side in Adelaide, therefore Keith Miller was moved to centre-half-forward, and Alan was selected in the starting eighteen to play on a half-forward-flank against Swan Districts at Leederville. Alan grabbed his chance and had a major influence on the game by kicking 5 goals on tough Swan Districts defender Lou Milanko, and the team ran out winners by 33 points. From that point, he went on to play in four WAFL grand finals in his first seven years, and at only 27 years of age had three premiership medallions to his name.\n\nHe joins champion Les Fong in third position for the number of games played for West Perth, (both have played 284 games). Alan and his best mate since school days, Stephen Smeath, often worked out strategies on how to get the ball to one another on match days, to great effect, and earned them the title of the Dynamic Duo. Alan Watling is a legend of West Perth and WAFL football. A greatly respected player by his teammates, opposition players, and the football public. His achievements are testament to his skills and dedication to the game he loves.\n\n33. Les Fong - Player\n\nLes with his three brothers Graham, Stephen and Neale all loved football. They all played at Nollamara Junior Football Club and the 3 brothers all played for Nollamara Amateurs and Neale also with Trinity Aquinas. Les started his career as an eight-year-old with Nollamara Juniors in Under 12. Believe it or not but at one stage he was a ruckman, then Ruck Rover to eventually being a rover.\n\nHe was recruited to West Perth in 1972 by Peter Steward via his future father in law’s letter as Les those days was not allowed to play on Sundays in which the 3rd & 4th and Under 18s competitions were played. His father in discussion with Len Roper and Ron Bewick agreed to play him only in the 2nds so he would not supposedly get hurt. Les as a 16-year-old, won the Seconds Best + Fairest medal in 72 where he played as a rover.\n\nLes made his debut in the senior team in round 8 of the 1973 season against East Fremantle at the age of 16 ½. He became the youngest player to represent West Perth at league level at the time until Geoff Hendriks in 1975. He was emergency (21st Man) to the 1973 loosing Grand Final against Subiaco. Despite only playing a handful of 2nds games, he played well enough to take the seconds fairest and best award for the second time.\n\nLes was nicknamed by Leon O’Dwyer as “Chop Sticks”. This name later became known as “Choppy” by teammates and supporters. Les was a strong ‘in and under’ player, always at the fall of the ball, always showing a strong desire to win the ball at all costs, with aggression and speed, the press nicknamed him 'Captain Courageous'. Les was awarded the Breckler Scholarship in 1974 when he started University.\n\nLes turned 19 thirteen days before the 1975 finals started. He gave his best performance of his short career in the second semi-final against Swan Districts. A feature of his game was his superb tackling. He tasted premiership glory in 1975 when West Perth defeated South Fremantle.\n\nLes was elected club captain in 1980 taking over from Geoff “Bushy” Taylor. Les remained captain through to 1986 (7 years), making him the longest serving captain at West Perth and also in the history of the WAFL.\n\nHe won the club best and fairest in 1982 and 1983. Les finished his career in 1987 at the age of 31, he played 284 games, another season would have allowed him to reach the 300-game milestone.\n\nAfter retiring from playing, he began coaching Trinity Aquinas in the Western Australian Amateur Football League for three years. Runner up in 1988. He then coached the Sunday Football League club Wanneroo to consecutive premierships in 1991 and 1992.\n\nLes Fong is the first rover in West Perth's official 'Team of the Century'. Les Fong was inducted into the West Australian Football Hall of Fame in 2006.The Arena Joondalup gates were named after Les Fong and commissioned in 2001. A plaque was presented to Les from Phil Hanna the club President.\n\n34. Peter Menaglio - Player\n\nPeter was always going to be a footballer, playing junior football at Osborne Park from 6 years of age, was coached by his father at 8 and 9 years old. He played football at Tuart Hill primary with Corry Bewick. Corry convinced him to play his junior football at Tuart Hill Football Club with Ron Bewick as the team manager. Ron arranged for Peter and Corry to play for West Perth colts in 1976.\n\nPeter was picked to play his first senior game on 14th May, in Round 9, 1977 as a rover. He was given Leon O’Dwyer number 9 and was roving in Les Fong’s place, who was away playing state football for WA. That was Peter’s only game for the year.Peter became a regular player in 1978, under coach Percy Johnson. Getting picked to play on the wing was a huge compliment, competing with the champions of Alan Watling and Steven Smeath. Peter polled 5 Sandover votes in his first full year.\n\nPeter’s game went to the next level under the coaching of Graeme Campbell. He polled the most Sandover votes from West Perth in 1979 with 11 votes. Peter had a standout year in 1981, winning the Breckler medal, winning on count back from Brian Adamson with 121 votes. He also polled very well in the Sandover with 12 votes. Peter was selected in the State side together with Ross Gibbs. He received an offer to play at Fitzroy in 1981 but declined.\n\nPeter’s ball sense and anticipation always gave him time to deliver the ball downfield with position and poise. He was a gifted footballer with balance and silky skills. The West Perth supporters loved watching Peter play and in return he always gave a 100% effort, which always excited the supporters.\n\nPeter won his second Breckler medal in 1984, just pipping Les Fong. Peter finished equal runner up in the Sandover Medal, to the three tied winners (Michael Mitchell, Peter Spencer, and Steve Malaxos). With the changing of coaches from John Wynne in 1986 to Bruce Monteath in 1987, Peter was made captain taking over from West Perth longest serving captain Les Fong.\n\nPeter played State football in 1987, 1988, again in 1989, he won his third Breckler medal on a count back from Craig Nelson in 1989. Peter played his last game in 1989 at the age of 29, against Fremantle in a replay of the drawn 1st Semi Final against East Fremantle at Subiaco Oval. The 12 years of physical impact of bigger opponents on Peter’s body, helped make the decision to hang up his football boots. This, along with the ambition to move into Real Estate and retire from Primary Teaching, ended the career of one of West Perth most gifted footballers.\n\nHe played 236 games for the club between 1977 and 1989, winning club fairest and best in 1981, 1984 and 1989. In 2000 Menaglio was selected in West Perth's Team of the Century.\n\nAfter retirement, Peter served as a club selector for several years. Worked with Corry Bewick and David Palm in coaching the West Perth development squad during the 90’s.\n\n35. Paul Mifka - Player\n\nPaul Mifka was West Perth’s ‘Mr Fixit’.\n\nPaul was the outstanding recruit of the year in 1984, also destined to be an original West Coast Eagle. He made his debut in 1984 as a wingman and played every game with the Falcons. He won several media awards as best first year player and finishing behind only Peter Menaglio and Les Fong in the Breckler Medal.\n\nHe showed glimpses of brilliance as a dangerous forward and finished his distinguished career as a dour and uncompromising defender.\n\nWidely regarded as one of the WAFL’s most versatile players, the physically gifted boy from Balcatta used his physical strength and blistering speed off the mark to dominate his opponents all over the ground.\n\nHe joined West Coast in 1987, for their inaugural season but had to wait until the last home and away match to make his debut. The former Balcatta player gathered 14 disposals in a convincing win over St Kilda at Subiaco Oval and it would be his only appearance in the seniors. He was picked up by the Brisbane Bears in 1990 AFL draft but it wasn't successful and he ended up back at West Perth.\n\nIn his 16 seasons and 283 games in the red and blue, Mifka was virtually unbeatable one-on-one.\n\nMifka had a unique ability to side-step his way out of trouble – particularly when he needed to swing onto his prodigious left boot – and when he launched into a trademark run down the wing at Leederville or Joondalup, the Falcons faithful greeted their cult-hero with chants of ‘Mifka, Mifka, Mifka’, from the stands.\n\nIndividually, the 1993 season was an outstanding one for Mifka. He polled a career-high 25 votes to finish fifth in the Sandover Medal, before more importantly, winning his one and only Breckler Medal a few weeks later.\n\nNothing summed up Mifka’s ability to play the swingman role than his extraordinary feats during the 1995 season, a famous one for the club.\n\nIn round 17 against Perth at Joondalup, the Falcons turned a 27-point quarter-time deficit into a 93-point victory. John Dimmer moved Paul Mifka from defence to centre half forward and the game changed, inspired by Mifka’s stunning 10-goal haul, kicking 10.4 in the last three quarters.\n\nThen, just under two months later, he helped the club to an historic and drought-breaking premiership triumph. After Subiaco star Jason Heatley booted 10 majors of his own in a losing effort against West Perth in the second semi-final, realising the goalkicker’s threat, coach John Dimmer sent Mifka to the opposition goal square.\n\nThe rest is history. Heatley had no impact as the Falcons broke a 20-year premiership drought. It solidified Mifka’s status as a club great.\n\nThere was no more fitting way for Mifka to bid farewell to the Falcons faithful than another flag – this time in 1999 – as the veteran shrugged off an injury-plagued year to play a role in his team’s September success over the Fremantle-aligned South Fremantle.\n\n36. Alec Breckler - Administrator Club President\n\nAlec Breckler first went to Leederville Oval at the age of ten and started barracking for the Cardinals. This started his love for West Perth football club, and he only had blue and red eyes - One eye blue and one eye red.\n\nAlec lost his father at an early age and had to start his working career. His family lived in Mt Lawley, and he always walked to Leederville Oval, to see the Cardinals.\n\nAlec with wife Hannah had two daughters. He had a brother Cecil who went to games too.\n\nAlec always volunteered. He did a lot of philanthropic work for the Jewish community in particular the holocaust survivors from the war that migrated to Perth. The Breckler family were instrumental in raising money for various Jewish causes around the world.\n\nAlec made sure he was not devoting too much time to the Jewish community, as he realised, he had a strong attachment to West Perth. He loved going to all West Perth football games and he felt he was in a position to help the club.\n\nAt 30 years of age, Alec became the President in 1930. West Perth had not won a premiership for 30 years. Alec set about bring success to the club, in 1931 he convinced the committee to recruit the champion Fitzroy and Victorian ruck man, Jack Cashman. The committee agreed and Alec secured the services of Jack, who was appointed Captain coach. West Perth went on and beat East Perth 18:9:117 to 11:8:74 in 1932 and thus breaking a 32-year premiership drought.\n\nAlec then brought over Max Tetley from the eastern states along with a number of other footballers. There were no draft, and no monetary restrictions in these years. Alec would offer them a job in his company. West Perth went on to win three premierships in four years 1932, 1934 and 1935.\n\nAfter Alec stepped down from President, he continued to be the club patron. The club named the best and fairest award after Alec Breckler in 1960. The early winners were Peter Medhurst, Joe Fanchi and then Mel Whinnen.\n\nThe club announced on the 19th of September 1967, the Breckler scholarship to assist in the education of young players, the inaugural winner was Laurie Scanlon.\n\nPost retirement Alec continued to attend games. Players that stood out were Brian Foley, Mel Whinnen, Bill Dempsey, and John Vukman. He would go every week and sit in the president’s box with his granddaughters Debbie and Gayl. Debbie recalls being there with him. Every time he would buy her a Football Budget. Being female, they was not allowed in the men’s changeroom, but Alec would go down and get full team signatures of every single player on the day. Debbie wishes she kept all her editions.\n\nSadly, when Alec’s time at the club wound down as his wife Hannah became unwell. He found it a challenge to find time to go to the football. Hannah was incredibly supportive of Alec and the club. Often after a game the footballers would go back to the Breckler house for dinner and Hannah would put meals on.\n\nThe Breckler’s continue to go to West Perth games. Family members from three generations attended the 2022 WAFL Grand Final win by West Perth.\n\n37. Roy Ennis - Trainer\n\nROY ALLEN ENNIS, Born 12th December 1907, Passed away 10th September 1995, (Age 87)\n\nRoy was one of five children (3 boys and 2 girls) born to Joseph Jordan Ennis and Caroline Ennis (nee Jenke)\n\nHe attended primary school at Osborne Park Primary School before entering the workforce as a Fitter and Turner with Rushton Bushell and Co., Elder St, West Perth.
