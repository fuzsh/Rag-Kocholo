        "text": "Rear Admiral Lee Goddard, CSC QM MInt, MA, BSc\n\nBoard Member\n\nLee Goddard was appointed as a Director on the Pymble board in October 2023 and serves on the Asset Management Committee.\n\nLee is an Executive Leader who continues to serve as a Royal Australian Navy active reserve officer (rank Rear Admiral) following 34 years full time service until January 2021. He recently completed the Chief of Defence Force Inclusive Leadership Review.\n\nHe is married to Alexandra who is a Pymble graduate, and they have three children: Dom, Asha and Mathilde, with both his daughters currently at Pymble Ladies’ College.\n\nLee is the Executive Director of the Australian Missile Corporation, as well as a Non-Executive Director of AUSTAL and the Commonwealth Superannuation Corporation, an Advisor to the Minderoo Foundation and OCIUS Technologies, and the Chairman (Race Director) of the Sydney to Hobart Yacht Race.\n\nPrior to assuming his current industry roles, he was dual appointed as Commander, Maritime Border Command and Operation Sovereign Borders, responsible for the law enforcement and operational oversight of Australia’s maritime economic and security zones; covering more than 10% of the earths’ surface across the Indian, Pacific and Southern Oceans, Antarctic Territory and Australia’s northern maritime approaches. This was preceded by a two-year secondment into the Department of the Prime Minister & Cabinet.\n\nOn promotion to Commodore in late 2014, Lee assumed the role of Commander Surface Fleet, commanding 18 major warships and over 3,500 personnel. He has Commanded warships and joint-agency Taskforce’s at every senior Navy rank from Commander to Rear Admiral.\n\nHe has numerous post graduate qualifications and has contributed to a range of professional and academic journals focused on leadership, national security and international affairs.\n\nDr Kate Hadwen PhD, MEd, Grad Cert Ed(School Leadership), BTeach\n\nPrincipal\n\nI was blessed to grow up on a property between Goondiwindi and St George in rural Queensland where I learned so many important life skills that have remained with me to this day and assist me in my role of Principal of Pymble Ladies’ College.\n\nMy first job after leaving university was teaching a combined kindergarten to year three class, and since then I have held various teaching and leadership roles from kindergarten to year 12, including boarding, at schools in most states across the nation.\n\nI have also worked as a Senior Research Fellow at the Child Health Promotion Research Centre and Senior Lecturer at Edith Cowan University where I remain an Adjunct Research Fellow.\n\nI truly love being part of the development of a young person’s life and supporting their journey, knowing that, in some small way, you have helped mould who they will become.\n\nAt Pymble, we encourage and teach our girls ways to look after their health and wellbeing. If you want students – and staff – to show up as their best selves each day, you need to practise that same self-care.\n\nFor me, that involves spending quality time with my beautiful family, which includes my parents and two sisters, my husband Matt, our five children, their partners and our two dogs. I also try to run five kilometres each day, partake in Pilates and exercises classes and consume a mental diet of inspiring books and podcasts.\n\nOur College values of care, courage, integrity, respect and responsibility are embedded in our community, and I see firsthand our staff, students and families demonstrating them in action each and every day, even when no one is looking.\n\nPymble creates a safe, challenging and empowering environment for girls to have a go, try new subjects and sports, assume leadership roles and find their voices. It is incredibly rewarding to watch our students discover strengths and skills they didn’t know they possessed and develop a growing awareness that they can do anything they put their minds to.\n\nWe want our students to be courageous deep thinkers and adept users of technology, and we want them to celebrate diversity in all its forms and to be caring and respectful. We believe these attributes will equip Pymble girls to change the world in a positive and meaningful way.\n\nI am so proud to be the leader of such a special team. Our staff members are hard-working, talented, can share a good laugh and are deeply caring. I love the way they care for our students and each other, and I learn from them every day.\n\nFor someone who is thinking of joining Pymble, what are you waiting for? Come exactly as you are and meet our family. Each member brings a different skillset and story, and we can’t wait to hear yours.\n\nLamia Rockwell BEd, MLdrshp, MACE, MACEL\n\nDeputy Principal\n\nAfter spending my younger years in Lebanon and France, my family and I migrated to Sydney in 1988. My mother and maternal aunts are all teachers, and growing up I was, and still am, inspired by the great work that they do with and for young people.\n\nOutside of Pymble, you will either find me walking, doing Pilates or spending time with my beautiful nieces and nephew, however I’m a firm believer in creating a harmony between work and family life and keeping both sides aware and informed about the demands on my time.\n\nAs Deputy Principal, I’m truly privileged to work in a role with such a great level of responsibility alongside a team of like-minded, dedicated colleagues who all play their part in delivering the highest quality education and guidance to every one of our 2,000+ students.\n\nIt’s so rewarding coming to work each day and having the opportunity to help empower our young women to feel confident to face challenges and solve them with agility. The joy of watching our students celebrate their achievements and watching them grow into caring, compassionate citizens is second to none.\n\nPymble is a school that gives staff and students alike a space in which they can thrive and grow. The College declaration ‘Watch Us Change the World’ encourages students to be bold, courageous and explore their passion, whatever that may be, and the suite of learning offerings at Pymble both in and out of the classroom play a big role in facilitating that.\n\nFor aspiring teachers and staff members: if you want to grow professionally, be a valued member of a community, work in a caring and exciting environment and help guide a cohort of intelligent, curious young women who are thirsty for a holistic education, Pymble is most certainly the place for you.\n\nJustin Raymond BEd, DipEd(Innovation), MACE, MACEL, MACS, MTGN\n\nDeputy Principal – Students (K-12)\n\nI grew up in Adelaide, Melbourne and Sydney and have always loved spending time outdoors kayaking and running. Throughout my career I have had the privilege to teach across several subject areas and have professional experience in the IT sector, which probably explains my passion for information technology and data science.\n\nMy colleagues would describe me as calm, adventurous and dependable; traits that I find are quite helpful in my role as Deputy Principal helping lead over 2,000 energetic, talented young ladies.\n\nAs the leader responsible for all aspects of Pymble’s academic curriculum, I spend time working with teachers across all subject areas to ensure we are delivering an exceptional education experience for our girls.\n\nThe greatest joy in my role comes from helping teachers make a difference, lighting their fire in taking on new challenges and providing coaching for professional growth. What I love most about working with my Pymble colleagues is the passion and expertise that we all share. It is a pleasure to work with such an incredible group of educators.\n\nPymble is a big school and its size and scale provide many opportunities. For our staff, it provides an incredible amount of career opportunities (both roles and professional learning). For students, they have the world at their feet. From academic subjects through to co-curricular, everything they could ever imagine, plus more, is available to them.\n\nThe advice I would give to someone thinking of joining Pymble is do not hesitate; jump in and become part of the family. You will be challenged, you will grow and you will be surrounded by like-minded professionals who are committed to excellence.\n\nChristine Kenny BA(Hons), Dip Teach, MInstrLead, MACE, MACEL\n\nDeputy Principal Academics (K-12)\n\nAs the Deputy Principal Academic (K-12), I lead the Academic Pillar and a passionate and innovative teaching and learning team. I work closely with curriculum leaders across the College to provide authentic and engaging learning experiences that assist Pymble students to become women of influence and compassion in the world.\n\nI enjoyed an idyllic childhood, growing up with easy access to both the beach and the bush near Wollongong before moving to Sydney to attend university after completing my HSC. My love of reading and literature drew me to the University of Sydney where I completed a Bachelor of Arts degree with an Honours year in English. I then commenced teaching English and History in schools in Sydney’s Inner West, whilst also pursuing opportunities in government training and strategic planning.\n\nAs Head of English at Meriden School in Strathfield, I led a collegial, dynamic and creative Department, fostering student analytical and imaginative writing in fun and engaging ways. Students learned from writers in residence, author visits and poetry competitions which complemented rigorous teaching programs. I worked with my team to renew the texts studied, retaining some of the classics and including rich and diverse contemporary texts.\n\nMy focus broadened when I became the Head of Teaching and Learning. Excited by the oversight of all learning areas and motivated by the pursuit of excellence, I completed a Master of Instructional Leadership through the University of Melbourne. My research into identifying and reporting student progress shaped the nature and timeliness of feedback to parents and students at my school. Studying through the University of Melbourne also deepened my understanding of the various ways the Australian Curriculum is implemented and widened my network of educational colleagues.\n\nThrough my association with schools in Toronto, Canada, I enjoyed further opportunities to understand the global issues in education. Interested by the emergence of learning commons, I visited schools and universities to understand different approaches to the challenges of 21st century education. I value these connections highly and believe that much can be gained by sharing with colleagues.\n\nMy husband, Peter, and I enjoy spending time with our three adult children and travelling in Australia and overseas. I am delighted to belong to the Pymble family and look forward to meeting you soon at one of the College events.\n\nKate Brown MA(Hons), DipLaw, GDLP, MTeach\n\nHead of Junior School\n\nI grew up in the south of England and spent a lot of my younger years moving around the country due to my father’s job. I started my career as a family and criminal lawyer and continued in this profession after moving to Sydney in 1999.\n\nIt was not until my eldest daughter commenced kindergarten that I decided to retrain to become a teacher, much to the delight of my family who joked that I ‘saw the light’ as I come from a long line of educators. In fact, I’m the fourth generation of Heads of Junior School on my mother’s side of the family!\n\nI chose teaching as I was seeking more joy in my everyday life and wanted a career that would give me more opportunities to be creative and a greater sense of optimism – things I’ve certainly found here at Pymble.\n\nThe greatest joy in my role no doubt comes from the girls. I am constantly inspired by their curiosity and their passion for learning, their joy of connecting with one another and their hope and desire to have a positive impact on the world. The future is in very safe hands with these amazing young women.\n\nPymble is a dynamic community where you can dream big knowing that you will be supported in pursuing those dreams. Girls and staff alike are empowered to celebrate themselves, to explore and develop personal strengths and then use those strengths to change the world for the better.\n\nAndy Lang CA, MAICD\n\nChief Financial Officer\n\nAfter spending my younger years in a small town named Abergavenny in South Wales, I crossed the border into England to attend university where I studied to become a qualified chartered accountant. I secured a job at Ernst & Young straight out of university and worked there for five years before an opportunity arose within the company to relocate to Sydney in 1983.\n\nThe blue, sunny skies and the world-famous beaches were too hard to resist, so I jumped at the opportunity and made the move. It turned out to be a worthwhile decision as I continued working at Ernst & Young for almost 39 years before joining Pymble as Chief Financial Officer in 2018.\n\nMy time at Pymble has no doubt featured some of the best years of my professional career. Our girls are absolutely extraordinary and it’s a pleasure to work alongside my fellow colleagues who are 100 per cent committed to the development and success of not only the students but the College itself.\n\nThe depth and breadth of opportunities provided to both students and staff at Pymble are second to none, with equally outstanding support systems in place to help us seize these opportunities and achieve more than we could have ever imagined.\n\nI was given this advice on my first day at the College and it’s the same advice I would give to anyone thinking about joining Pymble, whether that be as a student or staff member: grab the opportunity with both hands and the possibilities are endless.\n\nJenny Roberts\n\nChief Operating Officer\n\nI am originally from Central Queensland and more recently have lived in Bathurst in regional New South Wales and in Darwin in the Northern Territory. I have spent the past 30 years working in universities, where I started my career as an executive assistant, and after many years in different and ever more senior roles I ultimately had the privilege of being appointed as a deputy vice-chancellor and vice president responsible for a range of services which supported the corporate functions of the university and the student journey.\n\nIn my role as Chief Operating Officer, I am responsible for professional services at the College, and I am very fortunate to manage great teams in Community Engagement and Advancement, Facilities Management, College Services, Master Planning, Project Management and Risk and Compliance. Our team is highly skilled, solutions-focussed and committed to providing an excellent service to our staff, students and the community.\n\nMany people ask me about the differences between working at a university and a school like Pymble. Whilst the obvious answer is that our students are children, where at a university they are mostly adults, there are undoubtedly more similarities than differences. Pymble has excellent learning and teaching classrooms and facilities, state-of-the-art technology, amazing specialist co-curricular and sports spaces and beautiful, serene grounds.\n\nAs a mum to two young women, there is nothing more important to me than the education of girls and for them to know their power and ability to do anything they dream of in life. I am a staunch advocate for gender equity and inclusion, and I love working at a school like Pymble that is committed to educating girls and young women and empowering them to change the world.\n\nPymble is a beautiful place to work. Not only does it look beautiful in terms of its grounds and facilities, but it is the people who make it beautiful. They are caring, friendly, welcoming and committed, which makes for a fabulous workplace.\n\nKate Rimer BEd, DipCM, MCom, GAICD\n\nChief People and Culture Officer\n\nI was born in Melbourne and grew up both there and in Sydney, however I have Swiss/German and Irish/English roots from several generations back. My career began as a secondary teacher in the Catholic system, but after a few years I moved into learning and development in corporate and professional services.\n\nAs Chief People and Culture Officer at Pymble, my role is about partnering with the leadership group to help nurture an authentic and caring workplace culture for all our staff. I also assist in finding great new employees and coming up with ways to help staff members flourish throughout their careers and embrace ways to maintain their health and wellbeing.\n\nThe staff at Pymble are amazingly passionate, energetic, innovative, humble and caring education professionals. It’s an absolute pleasure to work with such a highly collaborative and fun group of people who are always striving to deliver their best to our girls.\n\nWhile my role is centred around staff, I am also a feminist and believe strongly in girls’ education, actively supporting gender equity and providing young women every opportunity to flourish and reach their potential as individuals, both in the community and globally.\n\nPymble is big, beautiful, caring and a truly amazing place to work and learn. Our size and scale mean we have significant career opportunities, resources and variety in the work we do, and is a place where you can help change the world for our women of the future.\n\nAnthony England BEd, DipCS, MBA\n\nDirector of Innovative Learning Technologies\n\nI grew up in Sydney and became a teacher at the age of 22 after graduating from university. After nine years of teaching, I founded a company that just so happened to work closely with schools, before selling it after 15 years and once again becoming a teacher.\n\nOutside of the classroom – a place I’ve worked in or been closely involved with since I was four – I enjoy relaxing, listening to podcasts and spending time with my beautiful family. I’m not the greatest at exercising but I have a constant stream of energy, which must burn a few calories, right?\n\nMy role as Director of Innovative Learning Technologies involves developing, overseeing and maintaining all the technology at Pymble Ladies’ College. It’s a given that, at times, technology will let us down, but our staff are gracious and appreciative of the work my team does, both in the good times and the bad.\n\nPymble is an amazing place to learn and grow for students and staff alike. There are no barriers for our young women, no cultural limitations of what is possible and the support you receive for who you are and want to become is unlike anything I’ve ever experienced. A great example of this is that we boast the largest all-female robotics team in the world.\n\nAt Pymble, there is a place and opportunity for everyone, no matter your interests. Students and staff work together to create and scale excellence, and we have the resources to make dreams come true.\n\nDr Sarah Loch PhD, MEdSt, MTeach, BA\n\nDirector – Pymble Institute\n\nWhile my family has Scottish heritage, I was born and have lived in Sydney my entire life. My first career was as a social educator for adults with intellectual disabilities; a role within a very important group where I learned an incredible amount that has stuck with me to this day.\n\nAfter a few years working in disability services, I decided to become a high school English and History teacher due to my desire to work with young people, and because my own teachers had inspired me so significantly when I was in school.\n\nMy role as Director of Research and Development at Pymble is centred around leading professional learning and research, so my main duty is creating amazingly inspiring and thought-provoking opportunities for my experienced, committed and motivated colleagues.\n\nWorking in education – especially at Pymble – means you are very close to touching the future. This is an important time in history and girls and young women are shaping it in ways that will lead the world in a new direction.\n\nWith a couple of thousand inspirational girls and young women and over 500 devoted staff members, at Pymble, no project or idea is too quirky, too big or too complex to explore. The number of people within the College brings incredible diversity and creates the chance to make a lot of fantastic friends.\n\nStephen Dunk MA, BA, DipEd MA, BA, DipEd\n\nDirector of Staff\n\nMy dad was born in Australia and my mum grew up in England and Northern Ireland, however I grew up in Sydney’s western suburbs. I always wanted to be a teacher from my earliest school days, and when I reached high school and started learning languages, I knew it was the job for me.\n\nAlongside my passion for teaching, I love taking walks along the coast, reading books and cooking meals for family and friends. I also enjoy walking my dog, playing tennis and listening to music. You could say I live and breathe the simple life.\n\nI have been in my current position of Director of Staff at Pymble for two years, however most of my time spent at the College has been as Director of Studies, a role which I held for almost 16 years.\n\nPymble Ladies’ College is an incredible place to work. My role involves a lot of interaction with staff from every department and corner of the school, and it’s so wonderful to see the depth of knowledge, professionalism and desire to make a difference to the students’ lives shown by every single one of my colleagues.\n\nPymble girls are so talented, intelligent and aspirational, each in their own ways, and it’s fantastic how eager they are to seize the incredible opportunities afforded to them at this great school.\n\nOne of the best things about the College is that students and staff are able, and encouraged, to make a difference, no matter how small. You will work hard, but the rewards and self-satisfaction will always be a testament of your efforts.\n\nStephen Campbell BA(Hons); CTeach; MSc (Oxon); FRSA; FCCT\n\nChief Strategy Officer\n\nI have been a teacher for all of my adult life and could not imagine doing anything else. I believe passionately in the transformative power of education to make the world a better place.\n\nI started my career at a large state school in the south west of England and have since have worked in international education and at two leading independent schools in the UK. In all my roles, my joy has come through working with the students to help them better understand themselves as learners and as people. More recently, I have taken great joy in understanding teacher and adult education, and how wide the impact can be when all members of a community grow and learn.\n\nI am excited to be joining Pymble; the opportunity to work alongside such wonderful staff, to educate such ambitious, perceptive girls and the chance to be part of a community whose values align so closely with my own is one that I feel truly honoured to take up.\n\nTom Riley BAppSci, DipEd, MLdrshp\n\nHead of Campus – Vision Valley\n\nI grew up in the UK in a teaching family and attended boarding school for my last few years of school. Seeking new opportunities, I made the move to Australia for university and whilst studying, I also worked part-time at The King’s School in boarding, coaching sport and tutoring. After graduating I was fortunate to be offered a role teaching biology, and later led The Future Project through which students collaborated with scientific researchers in the school’s own PC2 laboratory.\n\nPost King’s I have been fortunate to work at MLC Burwood, Kinross Wolaroi School in regional NSW and most recently Pymble. I have enjoyed my different leadership opportunities at each school, working in pastoral care, academia, outdoor education and collaborating with local businesses for place-based learning opportunities whilst in Orange. I too have furthered my interest in leadership through a Masters of Organisational Learning at Monash University.\n\nI firmly believe that education is the key to progress, understanding and ultimately improved connection, and I enjoy environments that foster a culture of curiosity. I have loved Pymble’s desire to change the world through the empowerment of young women and feel very privileged to play my part.\n\nWhether it be encouraging our girls, and their families, to build stronger connection to self, others, and the natural world through our Residential Program, offering global student exchange or bringing in a plethora of amazing guest speakers, each day I feel inspired by my colleagues and our environment.\n\nJust like our remarkable girls, Pymble is always considering ways to improve to be at our very best, and that makes it a rewarding place to work, live and learn.\n\nEdwina O’Brien\n\nAssistant Chaplain and Head of Religion and Ethics\n\nMy family originally came from Wales and England, but I grew up here in Sydney. My household is myself, my husband, our three daughters, my mother-in-law and our two staffies.\n\nI was an English teacher for 25 years and I love to read and discuss literature. I also love bushwalking on the tracks near my house in North Turramurra and spending time with my daughters.\n\nBefore Pymble, I taught at schools on the Central Coast, in the inner west, in London and at a ‘behaviour’ school for at-risk students in Cabramatta in Sydney’s west. All were precious learning experiences in their own way.\n\nMy mother was able to attend Pymble thanks to an academic scholarship and a generation later, I was privileged enough to also come here as a student. A lot has changed since those days but what has not changed is the selfless care that teachers and staff give to Pymble students.\n\nIt is a great privilege to see this care and love each day and to play a part in the spiritual life of the College."
