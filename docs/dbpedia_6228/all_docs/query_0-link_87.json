The program's format includes political commentary and criticism, and its \"Rumour File\" is a source of news items that occasionally become headlines in mainstream news programs. Campbell's role as host of the program for many years has allowed him to command one of the highest salaries offered to a radio host on the continent. \"Stevenson's breakfast program with John Burns, which rated 17.9 in the last Nielsen Media Research radio survey,\" Suzanne Carbone wrote in an article published in the Age, \"commands top advertising rates and sets the foundation for the day's ratings. It is said Stevenson would be worth millions more in the Sydney market.\"\n\nStevenson is also the coauthor of the television comedy The Games, which satirizes the goings-on of the committee that brought the Olympic Games to Australia. Part of what made the comedy so successful in retrospect was the fact that the activities of the real committee were as outrageous as the satire itself. In fact, \"on many occasions,\" declared a reviewer for the Anarchist Age Weekly Review, \"the television series was a pale imitation of the machinations which surrounded the games.\"\n\nBIOGRAPHICAL AND CRITICAL SOURCES:\n\nPERIODICALS\n\nAge, December 16, 2004, Suzanne Carbone, \"Meet AW's $10m Man.\"\n\nAnarchist Age Weekly Review, August 27, 2001, review of The Games.\n\nONLINE"
