        "text": "The search is on for an aspiring Scottish artist to spend a fully funded three month residency in New York, made possible through a collaborative initiative between the Saltire Society, the Steven Campbell Trust, International Studio and Curatorial Programme (New York) and Creative Scotland.\n\nThe scholarship will involve a three month residency as part of the International Studio and Curatorial Programme (ISPC) in Brooklyn. The winning artist will be given dedicated studio space and the unique opportunity to work alongside 45 fellow artists in residence. The winner will also be the first Scottish artist ever to have received a place at this internationally recognised studio.\n\nThe Steven Campbell New York Scholarship is part of a wider £50,000 programme of bursaries to support young and emerging Scottish artists, recently unveiled by independent charity the Saltire Society to help celebrate its 80th anniversary year.\n\nThe late Steven Campbell is widely recognized as one of the most significant Scottish artists of his generation. Born in Glasgow, Campbell was a student of Glasgow College of Art and went on to gain a Fulbright Scholarship, which he used to go to New York to study at the Pratt Institute before returning to live in Glasgow in 1986. His widow Carol Campbell founded the Steven Campbell Trust following his death in 2007 with the aim of broadening creative thinking and creative output in individuals and communities of practice in a manner which reflects Campbell’s own international outlook and eclectic and imaginative works.\n\nThe scholarship is open to graduates from Edinburgh College of Art, Glasgow School of Art, Duncan of Jordanstone in Dundee, Robert Gordon’s in Aberdeen, and Moray College of Art (University of the Highlands and Islands). The scholarship will fund return flights to New York from Scotland, studio fees at ISCP, accommodation costs in New York and a contribution towards living expenses.\n\nCompleted applications must be sent to saltire@saltiresociety.org.uk no later than 12 noon on 17th June 2016.\n\nThe successful applicant will be announced at the Saltire Society’s headquarters in Edinburgh on 11th August 2016.\n\nBased on advice from ISCP as to the artists who may benefit most from this experience, the Scholarship is aimed at people having graduated between 2004-2012 inclusive. Applicants must be available to take up the full period of their residency from 1st November 2016 until the 31st January 2017.\n\nLocation: All Scotland ,International\n\nFor further information, please contact saltire@saltiresociety.org.uk (saltire@saltiresociety.org.uk), or visit http://www.saltiresociety.org.uk/news/2016/05/16/the-search-is-on\n\nThe deadline is Friday 17 June 2016 at 12:00."
