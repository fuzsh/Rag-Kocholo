        "text": "The brothers Harry and Tony Campbell were both born in Cape Town. Their English speaking father, Harry Campbell Senior, taught his sons to play various musical instruments and provided them with musical inspiration at a young age. The Campbell’s mother, Sandra, was raised in Pretoria in an Afrikaans home. Sandra encouraged her sons to be fully bilingual.\n\nLike most children the Campbell’s attended government schools. Harry matriculated in 1993 and went on to study Motor Mechanics and Electrician Work. Tony matriculated in 1994 and then obtained a National Diploma in Electrical Engineering as well as Financial Concepts and Marketing Management. Many school bands and friendships were formed during their school years. Although a primary school band could not be considered professional the slick performances by the bands attracted many followers and earned the band members a reasonable amount of pocket money. During high school the brothers realised that it would only be the two of them that would put the effort in, to go all the way. It was at this stage that the Campbell Brothers had officially become a duo and in 1995 the brothers were considered a professional music group.\n\nDuring their tertiary education the Campbells invested in recording studio equipment and commenced audio recordings on a part time basis. At this stage Harry was a gifted guitarist and Tony played drums, keyboards and was the lead vocalist in the group. Every year the Campbells improved musically and performed more frequently, to larger and larger audiences.\n\nIn 1999 the brothers met Kosie van Niekerk, the owner of Select Music. Kosie asked if they would record material for his record label and the Campbells agreed. In 2000 Kosie proceeded to sign the Campbells as artists with Select Music and released their debut album “You’re My Mate” during 2001. Their radio single: Suzanne Suzanne was an instant hit and immediately there was talk about the new young South African cowboys that performed country, rock ‘n roll and pop dance music. The Campbells appealed to both the English and Afrikaans markets and decided to write and produce a few Afrikaans songs. Their second album “Rooi Rok Bokkie” was a huge commercial success and achieved more than 100,000 CD sales.\n\nIn 2003 the Campbells became a household name and the most successful touring act of the year with more the 200 live performances, 60 flights and 180,000 km of road travel in a calendar year. The album “Jy’s Die Girl” was released in 2003 and was predictably another huge success, but their 2004 release “Daar’s Iets Innie Water” rocked the South African music industry with the massive hit “Bietjie Bietjie Lam”. Once again the Campbells surpassed album sales of more than 100,000 units and became one of a handful of South African artists to have two double platinum selling albums.\n\nIn 2009 the brothers teamed up with Spur to record Hillbilly Rock. Now a theme song and dance in all Spur restaurants in South Africa and a viral favourite on TikTok and YouTube.\n\nIn 2010 the Campbells won a SAMA (South African Music Award) with their album Mamma Maria for the Best Sokkie Dans Album. They have also won 3 VAMT awards as well as 16 Gold, 7 Platinum, 3 Triple Gold & 2 Double Platinum sales awards. These well deserved awards cements their place within the South African music industry.\n\nIn 2012 the Campbells celebrated their 12th professional year in the South African recording industry and after seeing out their record contract with Select Music they started up their own record label, Campbell Records and subsequently released the albums Voet In Die Hoek, Fanta & Cola, Homegrown Country, Bloed Is Dikker As Water and Mega Medleys.\n\nThe Campbells have shared the stage with South African super stars such as Steve Hofmeyr, Kurt Darren, Snotkop, Demi Lee Moore, Theuns Jordaan, Gerhard Steyn and also collaborated with the likes of Juanita du Plessis, CH2, Jacques de Coning, Fredi Nest and Cordelia.\n\nMost recently the Campbells celebrated 2020 with a Top 20 collection of their 4 favourites genres: Afrikaans, Country, Party and Sokkie music. The latter including new original songs such as “500 Rose” and “Sexy Lyfie”.\n\nOver the years The Campbells have also performed in Germany, Switzerland, Zambia, Mozambique, Namibia, Botswana and Zimbabwe. The brothers are now based in Flower Mound, Texas, USA and perform to an international audience as the Campbell Brothers. Their music and videos are readily available on major platforms such as Spotify, YouTube, Apple Music and Amazon Music.\n\n20 albums, 4 EP’s and 8 DVD’s later, the Campbells have established themselves as South Africa’s favourite music group and have sold more than 1,000,000 CD’s & DVD’s. Their most popular songs have been remixed for todays audience and it is no surprise that they have now surpassed 100,000,000 digital streams and views across all online platforms.\n\nSongs like Bietjie Bietjie Lam, Vat My Vas, Burger Dance, Sewe Soene, Mamma Maria, Yvonne, Fanta & Cola, Hillbilly Rock, Stoutgat and Rooi Rok Bokkie will always be remembered.\n\nFacts:"
