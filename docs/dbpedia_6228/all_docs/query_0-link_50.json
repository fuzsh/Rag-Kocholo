He earned a promotion to assistant coach in July 2024.\n\nIn addition to his coaching role, Campbell coordinates all aspects of the program’s recruiting efforts. He oversees all logistical elements of on-campus visits, organizes recruiting travel for the Tennessee coaching staff and more.\n\n\"Over nearly a decade, I have seen Lucas grow from an eager walk-on freshman my first season here at Tennessee into now a rising star in the coaching profession,\" Barnes said upon announcing Campbell’s promotion. \"This school and this basketball program mean so much to Lucas. He has been a key part of our staff over the past two years and has played a major role in our strong recruiting efforts, which he will continue to do while taking on additional responsibilities he is assuredly ready for.\"\n\nCampbell is a Tennessee alumnus who competed for the Volunteers during Barnes’ first four years on Rocky Top, 2015-19. He has been a part of the Tennessee program for all but one of Barnes’ seasons at the helm.\n\nThis is Campbell’s second stint on staff at Tennessee, as he served as a graduate assistant from 2019-21, following the conclusion of his playing career. During those two seasons, he spent hours in the gym daily, coordinating skill development workouts. He assisted heavily in the training of 2021 first-round NBA Draft picks Keon Johnson and Jaden Springer.\n\nAcross his eight full seasons with the Volunteers, Tennessee is 175-93 (.653), with five NCAA Tournament bids, three Sweet 16 runs, an Elite Eight appearance and four AP top-20 finishes. Tennessee won the SEC regular season crown in both 2018 and 2024.\n\nCampbell’s first full-time job came in 2021-22 as the director of basketball operations at East Tennessee State University. He accompanied former Tennessee assistant coach Desmond Oliver when he accepted the head coaching position in Johnson City, Tenn.\n\nA native of Knoxville, Tenn., Campbell began his college career as a member of the Volunteers’ track & field team, competing in long jump and high jump, before transitioning to the basketball team as a walk-on in October 2015.\n\nCampbell, who appeared in 16 career games, helped the Volunteers win the SEC regular season title in 2017-18 and then tie a school record with 31 wins in 2018-19, a campaign during which the team spent a month ranked first nationally. He played on back-to-back NCAA Tournament teams as an upperclassman.\n\nIn May 2019, Campbell graduated from Tennessee with a degree in supply chain management and a collateral in marketing. He later received his master’s degree in sport management from UT in May 2021.\n\nAs a prep standout, Campbell starred in both track & field and basketball at the Christian Academy of Knoxville.\n\nCampbell and his wife, Elliana—also a UT graduate—reside in Knoxville, with their daughter, Garland, and family dog, Mia."
