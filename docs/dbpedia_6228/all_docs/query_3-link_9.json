        "text": "OXFORD, Miss. — I recently spoke with former University of Central Arkansas head football coach Steve Campbell to get his thoughts on this week’s matchup between the Bears and the Rebels.\n\nCampbell is one of my best friends. We played high school football together and were in each other’s weddings. He is well known among Mississippi football circles for having coached Delta State to the 2000 NCAA Division II national championship and Mississippi Gulf Coast Community College to the 2007 NJCAA national championship.\n\nIn total, Campbell spent twenty years coaching college football at various Mississippi colleges. But this will be his first time attending an Ole Miss game in Oxford.\n\nHis Saturday’s have been full for most of the last 38 years between his own college career (He also won an NCAA Division II national championship as a player at Troy). I like to think that I contributed to his future success as a coach with all the Monday Night Talking Football games we played against each other at my house in the early 80’s—though that is probably wildly inaccurate.\n\nAlthough this will be his first time to witness a game in Oxford, he has attended Ole Miss games in the past. In fact, the first college game he ever attended was an Ole Miss-Arkansas one in Jackson when my father took us along with another friend to witness Billy Brewer’s first big win as Rebel head coach.\n\nCampbell’s son Steven (current athletic director at Mississippi Gulf Coast CC) graduated from Ole Miss and received a master’s degree from Central Arkansas. His daughter Tate is a senior in high school in Mobile and currently lists Ole Miss and UCA as her top two college choices. But Campbell still has plenty of ties among the Bears athletic department and he’ll be sitting in the UCA section this Saturday.\n\nWhile Campbell was the head coach at Central Arkansas, his team always scheduled at least one FBS program per season. The matchups they had during his tenure included ones against Oklahoma State, Kansas State, Texas Tech and Arkansas State. They fell to Texas Tech by a touchdown, and in his final season as head coach, they defeated an Arkansas State team in Jonesboro who had won a bowl game the previous season.\n\nI asked Campbell about how a head coach of an FCS team approaches a game against an FBS school and what his approach was in such situations.\n\nFormer coach Steve Campbell on how an FCS team approaches an FBS opponent\n\nCampbell went on to say that the ultimate goal for the FCS schools is to win a national championship and that games with the ‘big boys” help them prepare for their own playoffs. They help serve as a measuring stick of where they are and where they need to be in order to achieve that goal.\n\nI also asked Campbell what he expects to see this Saturday.\n\nCoach Steve Campbell\n\nCampbell also added that he thinks highly of the Bears’ quarterback, Will McElvain, who transferred from Northern Iowa. Though he struggled some against Missouri State last week, he believes that with a week under his belt, he’ll be better prepared to succeed.\n\nFinally, I wanted to know what he was looking forward to about his visit Saturday.\n\nCoach Campbell on visiting Oxford for Saturday’s game\n\nI’m looking forward to entertaining my friend of forty-plus years, his wife Shellie, and daughter Tate on Saturday. I can’t promise a Katy Perry sighting, but I can promise a good time. Maybe we can even work in some Monday Night Talking football."
