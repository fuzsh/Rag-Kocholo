He portrays Lord Corlys Velaryon in House of the Dragon.[1]\n\nBiography[]\n\nSteve Toussaint was born in the United Kingdom to Barbadian parents. He had his last name legally changed to \"Toussaint\" because his birth name conflicted with a pre-existing member of his actors' union. He chose the name from Toussaint Louverture, the Haitain revolutionary leader (as at the time he had been reading about him in \"The Black Jacobins\" by CLR James).[2]\n\nHe made his professional debut as Steve Dixie on The Memoirs of Sherlock Holmes.\n\nToussaint previously auditioned for several roles in Game of Thrones, including Areo Hotah.[3]\n\nOn February 11, 2021, it was announced that Toussaint would be playing Corlys Velaryon in House of the Dragon.\n\nCredits[]\n\nStarring[]\n\nHouse of the Dragon: Season 1 The Heirs of the Dragon The Rogue Prince Second of His Name King of the Narrow Sea We Light the Way The Princess and the Queen Driftmark The Lord of the Tides The Green Council The Black Queen\n\nHouse of the Dragon: Season 2 A Son for a Son Rhaenyra the Cruel The Burning Mill The Red Dragon and the Gold Regent Smallfolk The Red Sowing The Queen Who Ever Was\n\nSee also[]\n\nSteve Toussaint on Wikipedia\n\nSteve Toussaint on IMDb\n\nReferences[]"
