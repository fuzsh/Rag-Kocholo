For a number of years, Steve and Donna enjoyed attending their grandchildren's activities in music, dance, and sports, traveling to Columbus and Chicago to do so.\r\n\r\nSteve was a member of the Shelby First United Methodist Church. He is survived by his wife of 60 years, Donna (Yoss) Campbell; daughters: Stephanie Kelly of Chicago and Christina (Jeff) Hoeppner of Columbus; four grandchildren: Connor and Payton Hoag, Abigail and Megan Hoeppner; sister: Patricia (Jeff) Plumer; and nieces, nephews, and friends who adored him. In addition to his parents, Steve was preceded in death by his sister, Judy Klote, and stepmother, Wanda Campbell.\r\n\r\nIn keeping with Steve’s wishes, the family will hold a private graveside service at Mound Hill Cemetery in Seville, OH.
