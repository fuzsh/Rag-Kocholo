        "text": "Jarreau Campbell stands out in more ways than one with the Birmingham Brother Rice varsity boys tennis team.\n\nUnquestionably, the 16-year-old Campbell is a treat to behold on the court — he flies around with grace and power.\n\nThe junior is so accurate he probably could rip a backhand through a tiny portal if it meant points for the Warriors. He reached the state semifinals at No. 1 singles and is a tennis finalist in the inaugural Detroit Free Press Awards.\n\nCampbell, whose dad was a professional tennis player, also is the only African-American player on the Brother Rice roster. He estimated his school has a black population of around 5 percent.\n\nIt doesn’t bother him. In fact, life is as tranquil as can be with the team, in the classroom and the Bloomfield Hills neighborhood he lives in with parents Steve (a Detroit Catholic Central alum) and Tracey Campbell.\n\n“The team is probably the best part of Brother Rice to me,” Campbell said before Wednesday’s practice session at Bloomfield Tennis & Fitness. “We do a lot of unity dinners, a lot of team bonding.\n\n“Usually after every single practice, most of the team, we go to (sandwich shop) Jersey Mike’s or something like that to get food. ... I don’t think anyone feels left out.”\n\nMore: MLK would be 'flabbergasted' about today's society\n\nA question for MLK\n\nThat would be a reason for Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. to smile, had he lived to see his 89th birthday Jan. 15 (when this year’s national holiday is observed).\n\nCampbell also smiled when talking about King and his legacy, stressing that the civil rights leader — who was assassinated in 1968 — resonates with his age group.\n\n“I think his message still definitely connects with a lot of people,” Campbell said. “And I think my generation still recognizes him as a very important figure in the country and how things shifted.”\n\nIf Campbell could spend a minute with King, he’d ask him “maybe just how he was so calm about everything, always so peaceful. I’d probably ask him how he was so mentally tough and calm.”\n\nMaintaining an even-keel attitude in the crazy world of 2018 is sometimes easier said than done, but Campbell strives to do just that.\n\nHaving a rock-solid family sets the tone, with strong values and good education among other important components.\n\n“I always lived in a great community with good friends, good family,” Campbell said. “We love it here a lot. And it’s probably just surrounding yourself with the right people, you know?\n\n“Going to Brother Rice was a good decision, surrounding yourself with a lot of good kids, coming from good families.”\n\nDo your best\n\nYet he understands that not all African Americans can live in an upscale community and attend a private Catholic high school. That shouldn’t keep those perhaps less fortunate than he is from taking stock in their situation and working to make it better.\n\nFor them, taking school seriously and taking advantage of any athletic endeavors might be a good place to start.\n\n“I would say that just whatever situation you’re in, education-wise, to do the best that you can in that situation,” Campbell said. “And especially if you play a sport, to try and excel as much as you can in that sport.\n\n“You never know how far that sport could take you or how far your education could take you.”\n\nCampbell is on that path to achievement, with a 3.7 grade-point average and college aspirations to go along with his prep tennis stardom.\n\nHe is thoughtful in conversation and relishes the chance to discuss U.S. history, including King’s lasting legacy, in high school classes.\n\n“We get to really reflect on all the issues, current and past events,” Campbell said. “Really get to see what happened and, obviously, where things were wrong, where things were right, that kind of thing.”\n\nEmpathy — and tennis — help\n\nMeanwhile, whether or not the on-again, off-again world of racial tolerance ever settles down, Campbell knows he can only try to be a peace-loving person with empathy for what others might be experiencing.\n\nHe shares that advice.\n\n“The one thing that could help keep everyone on the same page would be just realizing that everyone’s kind of doing their best in whatever situation they’re in,” he said. “Definitely seeing things from the perspective of other people is very important, in any situation in life.”\n\nCampbell seems to be as on target with his thoughts about the world as he is with a laser shot over the net.\n\nAnd for him, having tennis in his arsenal — not to mention a former pro player at home willing to talk about his swing — is pretty comforting during seemingly rare times when he is stressed.\n\n“Tennis is like high-speed chess almost. You have to be very mentally tough and strong on the court,” Campbell said. “Regardless of adversity.”\n\ntsmith@hometownlife.com\n\nTwitter: @TimSmith_Sports"
