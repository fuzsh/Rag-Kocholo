He remained the keystone in Glenelg's forward line until around 1978, when he transitioned into the club's no.1 ruckman - and remained there until is retirement after the 1988 grand final. He was club captain for 6 seasons from 1983 onwards, and maintained his high standards throughout his career with many observers rating him as best on ground in Glenelg's 1986 grand final win. During his playing career he amassed 448 league games for Glenelg as well as 19 state appearances and won many awards including 3 Glenelg best & fairest awards, 1 Fos Williams Medal and 2 All Australian selections.

Tony Symonds, Chigwiddenâs coach in 1995-96, said he was âone of the most outstanding club men Glenelg had ever had. He has as much heart as any player Iâve played with and he doesnât accept second bestâ.\n\nChisholm, Don\n\nPlayed 29 games\n\nGlenelg Career\n\nPlayer#: 403\n\nPlayed: 1955--1959\n\nGames: 29\n\nGoals: 5\n\nMemorable Matches:\n\n1959-- Round 6 1959-- Round 9 1959-- Round 14\n\nChristie, Gary\n\nPlayed 101 games\n\nGlenelg Career\n\nPlayer#: 720\n\nPlayed: 1988--1993\n\nGames: 101\n\nGoals: 57\n\nAchievements:\n\n100 Game Player\n\n3 Grand Finals Played - 1988 1990 1992\n\nMemorable Matches:\n\n1988-- Round 11 1990-- Round 4 1990-- Round 9 1990-- Round 13 1990-- Round 14 1991-- Round 3 1991-- Round 6 1991-- Round 9\n\nChurchett, Colin\n\nNext\n\nPlayed 186 games\n\nGlenelg Career\n\nPlayer#: 278\n\nPlayed: 1943, 1946--1954\n\nGames: 186\n\nGoals: 556\n\nAchievements:\n\n100 Game Player\n\n500 Career Goals\n\n2X 100+ Goals in a Season 1950--1951\n\n4X 50-99 Goals in a Season 1947--1949, 1953\n\n1X 10 Goals in a Match\n\n6X Glenelg Top Goalkicker 1947--1951, 1953\n\nGlenelg Hall of Fame 1940--1960\n\n4X SANFL Top Goalkicker 1948, 1949, 1950, 1951\n\n1 Grand Finals Played - 1950\n\nBest of 13 goals in a match v South in 1949\n\n7 State Games, 30 Goals\n\nSA Football Hall of Fame Inductee in 2002\n\nMemorable Matches:\n\n1947-- Round 9 1947-- Round 11 1947-- Round 16 1948-- Round 3 1948-- Round 5 1948-- Round 10 1949-- Round 1 1950-- Round 1 1950-- Round 10 1950-- Round 17 1950-- Prelim.Final 1951-- Round 15 1951-- Round 18 1951-- 1st Semi-F 1953-- Round 4 1953-- Round 13\n\nSummary\n\nA full forward who seemed to have a sixth sense where the goals were to such an extent that a freakish snap at first would appear a fluke â but he could do it time after time. He was the only SANFL footballer to kick 100 goals in a season between 1941 and 1969 â and he did it twice. He could snap with either foot and was the first man to consistently kick goals from the boundary line with the checkside punt.\n\nClose, Brad\n\nPlayed 28 games\n\nGlenelg Career\n\nPlayer#: 1102\n\nPlayed: 2018--2019\n\nGames: 28\n\nGoals: 17\n\nAchievements:\n\nPremiership Player 2019\n\n1 Grand Finals Played - 2019\n\nCock, Raymond\n\nPlayed 65 games\n\nColbey, Brian\n\nNext\n\nPlayed 210 games\n\nGlenelg Career\n\nPlayer#: 525\n\nPlayed: 1966--1976\n\nGames: 210\n\nGoals: 24\n\nAchievements:\n\n200 Game Player\n\nGlenelg Hall of Fame 1961--1976\n\nAll Australian 1969\n\nPremiership Player 1973\n\n5 Grand Finals Played - 1969 1970 1973 1974 1975\n\n11 State Games\n\nMemorable Matches:\n\n1969-- Round 8 1969-- Round 16 1970-- Round 3 1970-- article 1971-- Round 5 1971-- Round 12 1972-- Round 15 1973-- Round 19 1973-- Grand Final 1974-- Round 12 1974-- Round 21 1975-- Round 1\n\nSummary\n\nAlways willing to back his judgment, this rebounding half-back âhad that incredible knack of getting the footyâ¦ he was rarely beatenâ, according to Kerley.

A safe mark with a big leap, and the ability to kick with either foot, his mental and physical toughness made him a noted big-game player. The VFL presented him with a trophy as their choice as SA's best in a famous win against the Vics in 1951, a year in which he was named in Sporting Life's all-star Australian Team of the Year.\n\nCrabb, Terry\n\nPlayed 65 games\n\nCranston, Trevor\n\nNext\n\nPlayed 154 games\n\nGlenelg Career\n\nPlayer#: 902\n\nPlayed: 2003--2011\n\nGames: 154\n\nGoals: 19\n\nAchievements:\n\n100 Game Player\n\n1 Grand Finals Played - 2008\n\n4th in Best and Fairest in 2008\n\nSummary\n\nCoach Mark Mickan, who lifted the Bays to successive minor premierships in 2008-09, described his inspirational ruckman as \"like a spiritual leader of the club because of the way he plays and the way he is around the club\".

In his third season he was an All-Australian and he continued to prove himself at the highest level in 20 State matches. A player with electrifying pace, he was the first Glenelg player to captain South Australia. Colin Richens called him âthe bestâ. A player with a great leap, only serious knee injuries stopped him being remembered as one of South Australiaâs greatest champions. As captain-coach he led Glenelg to the 1959 preliminary final after winning The Advertiser Cup night competition.\n\nDavison, Kym\n\nPlayed 22 games\n\nGlenelg Career\n\nPlayer#: 630\n\nPlayed: 1978--1979\n\nGames: 22\n\nGoals: 11\n\nMemorable Matches:\n\n1978-- Round 15 1979-- Round 20 1979-- Round 21\n\nDean, Robert\n\nPlayed 11 games\n\nGlenelg Career\n\nPlayer#: 653\n\nPlayed: 1980\n\nGames: 11\n\nGoals: 3\n\nMemorable Matches:\n\n1980-- Round 18 1980-- Round 19 1980-- Round 22\n\nDeane, Brett\n\nPlayed 82 games\n\ndeCure, Maurice\n\nPlayed 12 games\n\nGlenelg Career\n\nPlayer#: 390\n\nPlayed: 1953--1954\n\nGames: 12\n\nGoals: 3\n\nMemorable Matches:\n\n1953-- Round 4\n\nDickinson, Edward\n\nPlayed 13 games\n\nGlenelg Career\n\nPlayer#: 463\n\nPlayed: 1959--1960\n\nGames: 13\n\nGoals: 8\n\nMemorable Matches:\n\n1959-- Round 11 1959-- Round 13\n\nDonaldson, Alex\n\nPlayed 63 games\n\nDonovan, Mark\n\nPlayed 116 games\n\nGlenelg Career\n\nPlayer#: 703\n\nPlayed: 1985--1991\n\nGames: 116\n\nGoals: 3\n\nAchievements:\n\n100 Game Player\n\nPremiership Player 1986\n\n2 Grand Finals Played -

Never sacrificed an inch of ground and always proceeded towards the goal by the shortest possible route. His ability was emphasised by the fact he did not miss a State match between 1924-30.\n\nBiographical\n\nJim Handby was the first Glenelg player to be awarded the Magarey Medal for the league's fairest and most brilliant footballer. His award came in 1928 in the eighth year of the Club's history as a League side.\n\nTransferring from South in 1925, Handby gave Glenelg outstanding service until 1932. He was an ideal Magarey Medallist, combining football ability of a high order with scrupulous fairness. Strongly built, and with a fighting heart, Handby carried a heavy burden in the years he spent with Glenelg, because the side, although gaining strength, was never in the firing line when the finals came around.\n\nCaptain for a long time, he set his players a grand example by his powerful efforts to stem tides running against the Tigers.\n\nThe State selectors recognised his worth, having him on the half-back line in many stirring games , especially with Victoria.\n\nOne of the most thrilling interstate matches in which Handby played, was the tie with Victoria in 1928, his medal year. Opposed by Arthur Rayson, famous Geelong left-foot half-forward, the Glenelg man did a grand job that day in checking the brilliant Victorian. During the course of the game, both Handby and Rayson were knocked unconscious by the force with which they met in a violent collision as they were racing for the ball. It was typical of Handby's stamina that he was able to play with unimpaired vitality after receiving attention.\n\nAlthough Handby never saw Glenelg reach the finals during his playing career, the Tigers were building up to their 1934 peak when he retired as a player in 1932. After his retirement, he maintained interest in the game for many years as a commentator and writer.\n\nFrom The Tiger, 1962\n\nHandby, Michael\n\nPlayed 29 games\n\nGlenelg Career\n\nPlayer#: 872\n\nPlayed: 2001--2002\n\nGames: 29\n\nGoals: 20\n\nMemorable Matches:\n\n2002-- Round 6 2002-- Round 7 2002-- Round 16 2002-- Round 21\n\nHanley, Jack\n\nPlayed 54 games\n\nCoached 14 games\n\nGlenelg Career\n\nPlayer#: 1\n\nPlayed: 1921--1924\n\nGames: 54\n\nGoals: 36\n\nCoach: 1921; 14 games - 0% won\n\nAchievements:\n\n1 season Glenelg Coach (incl.

He died aged just 35, only seven years after leading the Tigers in their first game against West Adelaide. Despite overwhelming odds, he consistently played outstanding football.\n\nBiographical\n\nJack Hanley began his football career at Christian Brothers College, where he was coached by A. C. Norden , one of Victoria 's best umpires, who was in Adelaide at the time. On leaving college, Hanley played for South B grade, but after one season he was promoted to the senior eighteen. After two years with South he shifted to West, and there in his five years with that club played his best football. He was living at Glenelg when the Bays first came into existence, and he threw in his lot with the young side. He led them for three years, until a serious operation in 1924 compelled him to retire as a player.\n\nFrom 'The Tiger', 1962\n\nHannaford, Arthur\n\nPlayed 129 games\n\nGlenelg Career\n\nPlayer#: 207\n\nPlayed: 1938, 1946--1951\n\nGames: 129\n\nGoals: 15\n\nAchievements:\n\n100 Game Player\n\n1 Grand Finals Played - 1950\n\nMemorable Matches:\n\n1947-- Round 9 1948-- Round 6 1948-- Round 9 1948-- Round 11 1949-- Round 9 1949-- Round 10 1950-- Round 8 1950-- Round 9 1950-- Round 16\n\nSummary\n\nBest remembered as an honest, reliable half-back flanker - one of the best in the State - he played every position on the field and also could be a matchwinner - his last-gasp goal giving the Bays a place in the finals with a crucial fiveÂ­point win against North in 1950.\n\nHannath, Jack\n\nNext\n\nPlayed 43 games\n\nGlenelg Career\n\nPlayer#: 1116\n\nPlayed: 2020--2022\n\nGames: 43\n\nGoals: 7\n\nAchievements:\n\n1 Grand Finals Played - 2021\n\nHarford, Mel\n\nPlayed 28 games\n\nGlenelg Career\n\nPlayer#: 178\n\nPlayed: 1935--1937\n\nGames: 28\n\nGoals: 5\n\nMemorable Matches:\n\n1935-- Round 5 1935-- Round 17 1936-- Round 4\n\nHarrold, David\n\nPlayed 31 games\n\nGlenelg Career\n\nPlayer#: 51\n\nPlayed: 1923--1925\n\nGames: 31\n\nGoals: 33\n\nAchievements:\n\nGlenelg Top Goalkicker 1923\n\nMemorable Matches:\n\n1923-- Round 1 1923-- Round 3 1923-- Round 7 1924-- Round 11 1925-- Round 5 1925-- Round 6\n\nHart, Royce\n\nPlayed 1 games\n\nGlenelg Career\n\nPlayer#: 568\n\nPlayed: 1969\n\nGames: 1\n\nGoals: 2\n\nAchievements:\n\n1 Grand Finals Played - 1969\n\nMemorable Matches:\n\n1969-- Grand Final\n\nHarwood, Mark\n\nPlayed 29 games\n\nGlenelg Career\n\nPlayer#: 827\n\nPlayed: 1998--2001\n\nGames: 29\n\nGoals: 15\n\nMemorable Matches:\n\n1998-- Round 2 2000-- Round 2 2000-- Round 14 2001-- Round 8\n\nHaussen, Keith\n\nPlayed 102 games\n\nGlenelg Career\n\nPlayer#: 296\n\nPlayed: 1945--1951\n\nGames: 102\n\nGoals: 114\n\nAchievements:\n\n100 Game Player\n\n100 Career Goals\n\n1 Grand Finals Played - 1950\n\nMemorable Matches:\n\n1945-- Round 3 1945-- Round 5 1947-- Round 1 1948-- Round 2 1949-- Round 5 1949-- Round 11 1950-- Round 1 1950-- Round 2 1950-- Grand Final\n\nHawkes, Les\n\nPlayed 13 games\n\nGlenelg Career\n\nPlayer#: 7\n\nPlayed: 1921\n\nGames: 13\n\nGoals: 20\n\nMemorable Matches:\n\n1921-- Round 3 1921-- Round 4 1921-- Round 15\n\nHead, Henry R\n\nPlayed 7 games\n\nCoached 28 games\n\nGlenelg Career\n\nPlayer#: 52\n\nPlayed: 1923\n\nGames: 7\n\nGoals: 1\n\nCoach: 1922--1923; 28 games - 0% won\n\nAchievements:\n\n2 seasons Glenelg Coach\n\nWon the 1909 Magarey Medal with West Adelaide\n\nSA Football Hall of Fame Inductee in 2002\n\nMemorable Matches:\n\n1923-- Round 1 1923-- Round 3 1923-- Round 14\n\nHele, Simon\n\nNext\n\nPlayed 197 games\n\nGlenelg Career\n\nPlayer#: 745\n\nPlayed: 1991--2002\n\nGames: 197\n\nGoals: 66\n\nAchievements:\n\nGlenelg Captain 2001\n\n100 Game Player\n\nGlenelg Hall of Fame 1991--2023\n\n4 State Games\n\nMemorable Matches:\n\n1991-- Round 9 1993-- Round 23 1993-- 1st Semi F 1994-- Round 5 1994-- Round 7 1994-- Round 11 1995-- Round 4 1996-- Round 3 1996-- Round 5 1998-- Round 17 1999-- Round 8 2002-- Round 23\n\nSummary\n\nA skilful, speedy wingman who kept on fighting back from injuries â he broke his collarbone twice and dislocated his shoulder four times â refusing to believe he could not again wear his beloved Glenelg guernsey. Although he never won a Tigers club champion award, his consistency was borne out by the fact he was runner up in Glenelgâs best-and-fairest counts in 1996, 1998 andÂ 2000 and third in 1993-94 and 2002.\n\nHender, Lewis\n\nNext\n\nPlayed 37 games\n\nGlenelg Career\n\nPlayer#: 1003\n\nPlayed: 2011--2015\n\nGames: 37\n\nGoals: 41\n\nHender, Ned\n\nNext\n\nPlayed 47 games\n\nGlenelg Career\n\nPlayer#: 254\n\nPlayed: 1941--1946\n\nGames: 47\n\nGoals: 79\n\nAchievements:\n\nGlenelg Top Goalkicker 1946\n\nSA Football Hall of Fame Inductee in 2002\n\nMemorable Matches:\n\n1941-- Round 5 1941-- Round 7 1941-- Round 10 1941-- Round 11 1941-- Round 15 1946-- Round 13\n\nHenwood, Wayne\n\nNext\n\nPlayed 54 games\n\nGlenelg Career\n\nPlayer#: 701\n\nPlayed: 1985--1986\n\nGames: 54\n\nGoals: 20\n\nAchievements:\n\n2X Premiership Player 1985 1986\n\n2 Grand Finals Played - 1985 1986\n\nMemorable Matches:\n\n1985-- Round 5 1985-- Qual.Final 1986-- Round 14 1986-- Round 18 1986-- Prelim.Final 1986-- Grand Final\n\nHercock, Chris\n\nPlayed 95 games\n\nGlenelg Career\n\nPlayer#: 611\n\nPlayed: 1976--1983\n\nGames: 95\n\nGoals: 29\n\nAchievements:\n\n1 Grand Finals Played - 1977\n\nMemorable Matches:\n\n1976-- Round 13 1977-- Round 15 1978-- Round 2 1978-- Round 14 1982-- Round 18 1982-- Round 19\n\nHerron, Bill\n\nPlayed 64 games\n\nHewett, Don\n\nNext\n\nPlayed 118 games\n\nGlenelg Career\n\nPlayer#: 397\n\nPlayed: 1954--1962\n\nGames: 118\n\nGoals: 83\n\nAchievements:\n\nGlenelg Best & Fairest 1962\n\n100 Game Player\n\nGlenelg Hall of Fame 1940--1960\n\n4 State Games\n\nMemorable Matches:\n\n1956-- Round 1 1956-- Round 13 1957-- Round 3 1958-- Round 17 1959-- Round 6 1959-- Round 9 1960-- Round 4 1960-- Round 15 1962-- Round 1 1962-- Round 3 1962-- Round 5 1962-- Round 18\n\nSummary\n\nA centreman/wingman with outstanding ability and pace who could have been just about anything but for persistent knee injuries. Doug Long described him as an âout-and-out championâ. His courage was legendary at the Bay. He played despite many serious injuries and was able to star despite them. In 1962 he carried a shoulder injury but still starred in South Australiaâs three State games. Against Victoria at Adelaide Oval Hewett was South Australiaâs best, dominating the centre against Collingwoodâs Ken Turner.\n\nHiggins, Brett\n\nPlayed 34 games\n\nHill, Bryan\n\nPlayed 47 games\n\nHill, Clem\n\nNext\n\nPlayed 130 games\n\nGlenelg Career\n\nPlayer#: 80\n\nPlayed: 1925--1934\n\nGames: 130\n\nGoals: 31\n\nAchievements:\n\n100 Game Player\n\nPremiership Player 1934\n\n1 Grand Finals Played - 1934\n\nMemorable Matches:\n\n1925-- first win 1925-- Round 7 1927-- Round 3 1929-- Round 6 1931-- Round 1 1931-- Round 3 1931-- Round 4 1931-- Round 16 1934-- Prelim.Final\n\nSummary\n\nAs a stocky rover who kicked accurately with either foot, he booted three goals in his first game, which was Glenelg's breakthough win in 1925. His 130th and final game - on the wing - was in Glenelg's first grand final triumph, against Port in 1934.

Captain-coach of Glenelg's first win - against reigning premier West Torrens in the opening round of 1925, he had pace to burn, a strong mark and was an excellent shot for goals with the place kick.\n\nHolder, Riley\n\nNext\n\nPlayed 38 games\n\nGlenelg Career\n\nPlayer#: 1137\n\nPlayed: 2022--2023\n\nGames: 38\n\nGoals: 14\n\nAchievements:\n\nPremiership Player 2023\n\n1 Grand Finals Played - 2023\n\nHolmes, Tom\n\nNext\n\nPlayed 58 games\n\nGlenelg Career\n\nPlayer#: 973\n\nPlayed: 2007--2013\n\nGames: 58\n\nGoals: 30\n\nAchievements:\n\n1 Grand Finals Played - 2008\n\nHolst, David\n\nNext\n\nPlayed 190 games\n\nGlenelg Career\n\nPlayer#: 607\n\nPlayed: 1975--1985\n\nGames: 190\n\nGoals: 109\n\nAchievements:\n\n100 Game Player\n\n100 Career Goals\n\nGlenelg Hall of Fame 1977--1990\n\n3 Grand Finals Played - 1977 1981 1982\n\nMemorable Matches:\n\n1978-- Round 8 1979-- Round 1 1979-- Round 6 1980-- Round 8 1981-- Round 2 1982-- Round 4 1982-- Round 8 1982-- Round 21 1982-- Elim.Final 1982-- 1st Semi F 1983-- Round 19\n\nSummary\n\nTough, determined, straight-ahead midfielder who could take a spectacular mark (as shown by his hanger over Wayne Phillis) and added steel to the skilful sides of John Halbert.

Won the Magarey Medal in Glenelgâs 1934 premiership year but a knee injury prevented him training in the week of the grand final. Despite that, he still played an heroic game, his towering mark on the goal-line in the last quarter sealing the flag. In his Magarey Medal winning year in 1934, he polled votes in 14 of 17 games, and was named in Glenelg's best players in 15 out of 20 games that season.\n\nBiographical\n\nGeorge 'Blue' Johnston became Glenelg's second Magarey Medallist in 1934 and played a pivotal role in helping them win their first premiership that season. Glenelg had reached the finals for the first time, but had a most inauspicious first appearance in a League major round when they were badly beaten by Port in the second semiÂ­final. However, they went on to defeat Sturt in the preliminary final and Port in the grand final, and Johnston played a leading role in this recovery, with his brilliant ruckwork and high marking.\n\nStarting with Glenelg in 1927, he reached the peak of his career in the 1930's, and was famous for his high, finger-tip marking. Johnston was a force in league and interstate football in the years until he retired in 1940.\n\nGlenelg supporters will remember him for two incidents in the closing stages of the 1934 grand final. After leading by 17 points at three-quarter time, Port had gained all the momentum and were closing the gap. They were launching another counter-attack from their backline and the ball seemed certain to reach scoring range, when Johnston, with a superbly judged turn, pulled down a one-hand mark in the centre of the field to restore the initiative to his side. Then, in the dying stages, after Port had drawn level on the scoreboard, he pulled down a towering mark and goaled in the goalsquare, to restore Glenelg's lead and no doubt inspire his teammates to hang on for a famous victory.\n\nFrom 1934 until the end of his career in 1940, Johnston was the leader of the South Australian rucks in many games against Victoria and Western Australia. Capable of withstanding intense opposition in the crushes, he was the aerial artist in the State ruck, which had \"Bull\" Reval and Bob Quinn, two famous Port Adelaide players, as his partners.\n\nIn view of the part he played in Glenelg winning their first premiership, Johnston's Magarey Medal award was greeted enthusiastically by football followers in all districts. There was no better known player at that time and the award to him of football's highest honor was a fitting recognition of his contribution to the game in this State.\n\nBased on article in The Tiger, 1962\n\nJohnston, Peter\n\nPlayed 76 games\n\nGlenelg Career\n\nPlayer#: 614\n\nPlayed: 1976--1981\n\nGames: 76\n\nGoals: 6\n\nAchievements:\n\n1 Grand Finals Played - 1977\n\nMemorable Matches:\n\n1978-- Round 17 1978-- Round 18 1979-- Round 14\n\nJolly, Hayden\n\nPlayed 43 games\n\nGlenelg Career\n\nPlayer#: 1023\n\nPlayed: 2013, 2015\n\nGames: 43\n\nGoals: 15\n\nJoseph, Aaron\n\nPlayed 98 games\n\nGlenelg Career\n\nPlayer#: 1038\n\nPlayed: 2014--2019\n\nGames: 98\n\nGoals: 8\n\nAchievements:\n\nPremiership Player 2019\n\n1 Grand Finals Played - 2019\n\nKane, Ben\n\nNext\n\nPlayed 110 games\n\nGlenelg Career\n\nPlayer#: 960\n\nPlayed: 2007--2011\n\nGames: 110\n\nGoals: 53\n\nAchievements:\n\n2X Glenelg Best & Fairest 2007, 2011\n\n100 Game Player\n\n1 Grand Finals Played - 2008\n\n23 games with Hawthorn before joining Glenelg, and 59 games with Sturt after.\n\nSummary\n\nWon 2 best and fairest awards with Glenelg, was silky skilled, and hugely athletic with the ability to run all day.

His determination and courage was shown by the way he played on with a broken collarbone in South Australiaâs win against Western Australia in Perth in 1962.

He was named in Glenelg's best players in 15 out of 20 games in the 1934 premiership season. Link and champion full forward Jack Owens were young Tiger fan Colin Churchettâs heroes in the 1930âs. âHe was a fearless, socks-down player who would run all day and was good around the goals, kicking screw punts or drop kicks equally wellâ, Churchett said.\n\nLink, Robert\n\nPlayed 33 games\n\nGlenelg Career\n\nPlayer#: 323\n\nPlayed: 1946--1948 .\n\nGames: 33\n\nGoals: 10\n\nMemorable Matches:\n\n1946-- Round 15 1947-- Round 9 1947-- Round 11 1948-- Round 5\n\nLinke, Ambrose\n\nNext\n\nPlayed 73 games\n\nLinke, Haydn\n\nNext\n\nPlayed 137 games\n\nGlenelg Career\n\nPlayer#: 465\n\nPlayed: 1959--1968\n\nGames: 137\n\nGoals: 5\n\nAchievements:\n\n100 Game Player\n\nGlenelg Hall of Fame 1961--1976\n\nRunner-up in 1961 Magarey Medal\n\nMemorable Matches:\n\n1959-- Prelim.Final 1961-- Round 8 1961-- Round 15 1961-- Round 19 1963-- Round 3 1963-- Round 11 1964-- Round 17 1966-- Round 1 1967-- Round 6 1967-- Round 8 1967-- Round 14 1967-- Round 17\n\nSummary\n\nPlayed just 15 out of the 19 games in 1961 but finished only two votes behind Magarey Medal winner John Halbert.
