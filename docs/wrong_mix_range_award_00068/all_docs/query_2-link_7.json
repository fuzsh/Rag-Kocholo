        "text": "By David Dodd\n\nHere’s the plan—each week, I will blog about a different song, focusing, usually, on the lyrics, but also on some other aspects of the song, including its overall impact—a truly subjective thing. Therefore, the best part, I would hope, would not be anything in particular that I might have to say, but rather, the conversation that may happen via the comments over the course of time—and since all the posts will stay up, you can feel free to weigh in any time on any of the songs! With Grateful Dead lyrics, there’s always a new and different take on what they bring up for each listener, it seems. (I’ll consider requests for particular songs—just private message me!)\n\n“Desolation Row”\n\nA new book is coming out very soon from Simon & Schuster, who are also my publishers. It’s a collection of the lyrics of Bob Dylan, in a definitive edition complete with variant versions of the words, scholarly essays, and, possibly, some degree of annotation—the working title for several months had been The Complete Annotated Bob Dylan Lyrics. The actual title is now The Lyrics: Since 1962, and the publication date is October 28. I plan to buy a copy—although not the autographed version, which goes for $5,000. It checks in at a shipping weight of over 15 pounds, 916 pages, and is roughly the size of an LP. Comes in a grey slipcase.\n\nPartly in honor of this publishing event, my first thought was to feature a post on the Bob Dylan covers the Dead slipped into their repertoire over the years. Clearly, calling Dylan an influence on the Dead is an understatement.\n\nThe Grateful Dead Lyric and Song Finder lists 39 songs by Dylan played by the Dead. Of those, a large number are performances of the Dead backing Dylan on their joint tour. But there are 11 or 12 songs that were staples of the Dead’s own repertoire. And of those, there are a number that were played often enough to be considered favorites of the band. “It’s All Over Now, Baby Blue,” was played 145 times. “Queen Jane, Approximately”: 129. “All Along the Watchtower”: 123. “Knockin’ On Heaven’s Door”: 76. But for me, the quintessential Dylan song performed by the Dead was always “Desolation Row,” which was performed only 58 times.\n\nThere’s so much in the song—such a torrent of words, and it seemed to go on so long at time that it was almost humorous. I remember hearing an anecdote about the Dead/Dylan tour, during which Dylan called for “Desolation Row,” and Weir asked him if he remembered all the words. “I’ll remember the ones that matter,” was Dylan’s reply.\n\nI did submit a book proposal for a Complete Annotated Bob Dylan Lyrics, and the sample song I annotated was “Desolation Row.” So I have spent some time with the song, although I could not stand up in front of a crowd and sing it beginning to end without forgetting any words, I’m certain of that. The word count comes in at 665. To compare, “China Cat Sunflower” has less than 100 words. Of course, that’s a simplistic point in many ways—a seventeen syllable haiku can contain worlds of meaning, after all.\n\nBut I think that it was something about the sheer volume of words, of references, of visuals and unseen plots and relationships contained within those words that lent the song a part of its meaning. As if Dylan was saying—look, everyone: the world, our country with its unsavory history, and our place in it and everyone’s place in it, is not something that you can just summarize in a neat sentence. It’s extremely complicated, and deserves your consideration on as deep a level as you might care to take it to.\n\nSo, just for fun, I’m going to post my annotated version of the lyrics to “Desolation Row,” as this week’s “Greatest Stories Ever Told” entry. I’ll enjoy hearing your reactions, additions, and most importantly, corrections!\n\nDesolation Row [1]\n\nThey're selling postcards of the hanging[2]\n\nThey're painting the passports brown[3]\n\nThe beauty parlor is filled with sailors\n\nThe circus is in town\n\nHere comes the blind commissioner\n\nThey've got him in a trance\n\nOne hand is tied to the tight-rope walker\n\nThe other is in his pants\n\nAnd the riot squad they're restless\n\nThey need somewhere to go\n\nAs Lady [4] and I look out tonight\n\nFrom Desolation Row\n\n-------------------------------------------------------\n\n[1] Desolation Row\n\nFinal track of Highway 61 Revisited. Recorded August 4, 1965.\n\nDesolation Row was listed as song number 185 in Rolling Stone’s top 500 songs of all time list.\n\nIn 1969, Dylan told Rolling Stone he wrote this song in the back of a New York cab. … It was spliced together from two consecutive takes during the last sessions for Highway 61. (RS Dec. 2004)\n\nFirst performed at the Forest Hills Music Festival in Queens, New York on August 28, 1965.\n\nDylan spoke to USA Today's Edna Gundersen about the song on September 10th, 2001: “And Desolation Row? That's a minstrel song through and through. I saw some ragtag minstrel show in blackface at the carnivals when I was growing up, and it had an effect on me, just as much as seeing the lady with four legs.\"\n\nThe Grateful Dead covered the song for a number of years in live performances, and when they teamed up with Dylan for the Summer 1987 Dylan and the Dead tour, Weir asked Dylan if he thought he could remember all the words to “Desolation Row,” before they launched into it. Dylan replied, “I’ll remember the ones that matter.” (For the record, Weir sometimes left out a verse here and there when they sang it.)\n\nThe song’s title contains at least two, and possibly a third, references. First to be called to mind is the Jack Kerouac novel, Desolation Angels, published in 1965. The novel had its origins much earlier, written around the same time as the publication of On the Road. The largely autobiographical work, in turn, takes its title from Desolation Peak, in Washinton State’s Cascade Mountains, where Kerouac was stationed as a fire lookout, and his journal from that period provided the basis for the novel.\n\nThe second reference is to Nobel Prize winner John Steinbeck’s Cannery Row, published in 1945, which follows the misadventures of a down-and-out group of Great Depression era residents of the Monterey, California neighborhood.\n\nLastly, this song, with its myriad of literary, biblical, and popular culture references, has something in common with the T.S. Eliot (mentioned in the song) masterwork, “The Waste Land,” and the two titles evoke the same stark landscape. Eliot’s poem dates from 1922, and is 434 lines in length. So numerous and obscure were the reference’s in Eliot’s work, that he himself provided footnotes to the poem.\n\n[2] postcards of the hanging\n\nThis entire verse points toward events in Duluth, Minnesota, Dylan’s hometown, which occurred on June 15, 1920. (Side note: Duluth, like the song itself, is at the end of Highway 61.) Three African-American circus workers were lynched by a mob of residents when they were accused, falsely, as it turned out, of raping a local girl. The incident made national headlines. The James Robinson circus arrived in town on the previous day. Following that evening’s performance, 19-year-old Irene Tusken and a companion, 18-year-old James Sullivan, accused six circus workers of threatening Sullivan at knife-point and raping Tusken. No physical signs of assault were found when Tusker was examined by her family physician the following morning; nevertheless, the six workers were arrested and jailed. A mob of 5,000 to 10,000 stormed the jail and took three of the accused men for a mock trial where they were found guilty. Elias Clayton, Elmer Jackson, and Isaac McGhie were taken to the corner of 1st Street and 2nd Avenue East, where they were lynched. Postcards were printed of the lynched bodies, and sold.\n\nThe making of postcards of lynchings was not unique to Duluth’s dark day, however. Dylan’s influence by Billie Holiday is documented in the film “No Direction Home,” and she made the song “Strange Fruit,” by the Jewish poet and songwriter Abel Meeropol, famous in 1939, singing it at the close of many of her concerts for the next 20 years, and recording it in 1939 and 1944. “Strange Fruit” became the anthem of the movement against lynchings.\n\n“Postcards of the Hanging” is the title of a 2002 compilation CD of performances of Bob Dylan songs by the Grateful Dead.\n\n[3] painting the passports brown\n\nU.S. Government Agents’ passports are brown instead of blue.\n\nAlso the title of a recording by Bruce Russell, released in 2001.\n\n[4] Lady and I\n\nPossibly a reference to Billie Holiday, whose nickname was Lady Day. Hence, both Dylan and Holiday looked out at, and sang about, the hangings by mobs.\n\nCinderella[5], she seems so easy\n\n\"It takes one to know one,\"[6] she smiles\n\nAnd puts her hands in her back pockets\n\nBette Davis[7] style\n\nAnd in comes Romeo[8], he's moaning\n\n\"You Belong to Me I Believe\"[9]\n\nAnd someone says,\" You're in the wrong place, my friend\n\nYou better leave\"\n\nAnd the only sound that's left\n\nAfter the ambulances go\n\nIs Cinderella sweeping up\n\nOn Desolation Row\n\nNow the moon is almost hidden\n\nThe stars are beginning to hide\n\nThe fortunetelling lady\n\nHas even taken all her things inside\n\nAll except for Cain and Abel[10]\n\n-------------------------------------------------------\n\n[5]Cinderella\n\nAn ancient, archetypal figure in folk literature, found throughout the world. The character embodies one who is wrongly discounted, whose true attributes are unknown or unappreciated, but who eventually proves everyone wrong by virtue of great success. Dylan’s son, Jakob, used the character in his Wallflowers song “One Headlight”: “But me & Cinderella / We put it all together / We can drive it home / With one headlight.”\n\n[6]It takes one to know one\n\n\"Only a person with identical character traits would be able to recognize those traits in someone else. Often used as a curt rejoinder to deflect an accusation; you're only saying that about me because it's true of you. Originated in the late nineteenth or early twentieth century.\" From Random House Dictionary of Popular Proverbs and Sayings by Gregory Y. Titelman (Random House, New York, 1996)\n\n[7]Bette Davis\n\nApril 5, 1908 – October 6, 1989. American actress. The “style” of putting her hands in her back pockets seems to derive from her habit of leaving her thumbs out.\n\n[8]Romeo\n\nCharacter from Shakespeare’s play “Romeo and Juliet,” whose ill-fated love for the daughter of a rival family, Juliet, led to a tragic end for both of them.\n\n[9]You Belong to Me\n\nEchoes of the 1965 Dylan song title “She Belongs to Me,” from “Bringing It All Back Home.”\n\n[10]Cain and Abel\n\nBiblical characters: the two sons of Adam and Eve. Cain murdered Abel, and when he was questioned about Abel’s whereabouts, asked if he was his brother’s keeper. The Biblical story of Cain and Abel is found in Genesis 4:8 ff.\n\nAnd the hunchback of Notre Dame[11]\n\nEverybody is making love\n\nOr else expecting rain[12]\n\nAnd the Good Samaritan,[13] he's dressing\n\nHe's getting ready for the show\n\nHe's going to the carnival tonight\n\nOn Desolation Row\n\nNow Ophelia,[14]she's 'neath the window\n\nFor her I feel so afraid\n\n-------------------------------------------------------\n\n[11]The hunchback of Notre Dame\n\nCharacter from the 1831 Victor Hugo novel, translated into English as The Hunchback of Notre Dame, whose name was Quasimodo. The novel’s original title in French was Notre Dame de Paris. He was born with “defomities”—a huge wart over one eye, and a hunchback, and was left as a foundling on the cathedral’s doorstep, on a Quasimodo Sunday, which is the first Sunday after Easter in the Catholic calendar. He is adopted and brought up as the cathedral bell-ringer, and loses his hearing as a result.\n\n[12]Expecting rain\n\nUsed as the title of an early Bob Dylan fansite (www.expectingrain.com), created in 1995.\n\n[13]Good Samaritan\n\nThe parable is found in the Gospel of Luke, chapter 10, verses 25–37.\n\n“On one occasion an expert in the law stood up to test Jesus. \"Teacher,\" he asked, \"what must I do to inherit eternal life?\". \"What is written in the Law?\" he replied. \"How do you read it?\" asked Jesus. The man answered: \" 'Love the Lord your God with all your heart and with all your soul and with all your strength and with all your mind'; and, 'Love your neighbor as yourself.'\" \"You have answered correctly,\" Jesus replied. \"Do this and you will live.\" But he wanted to justify himself, so he asked Jesus, \"And who is my neighbor?\" In reply Jesus said: (the parable starts here) \"A man was going down from Jerusalem to Jericho, when he fell into the hands of robbers. They stripped him of his clothes, beat him and went away, leaving him half dead with no clothes. A priest happened to be going down the same road, and when he saw the man, he passed by on the other side. So too, a Levite, when he came to the place and saw him, passed by on the other side. But a Samaritan, as he traveled, came where the man was; and when he saw him, he took pity on him. He went to him and bandaged his wounds, pouring on oil and wine. Then he put the man on his own donkey, took him to an inn and took care of him. The next day he took out two silver coins and gave them to the innkeeper. 'Look after him,' he said, 'and when I return, I will reimburse you for any extra expense you may have.' \"Which of these three do you think was a neighbor to the man who fell into the hands of robbers?\" The expert in the law replied, \"The one who had mercy on him.\" Jesus told him, \"Go and do likewise.\"” New International Version/p>\n\n[14]Ophelia\n\nCharacter in William Shakespeare’s play, Hamlet (ca. 1599-1601).

Strange Fruit: The Biography of a Song\n\nBy David Dodd\n\nHere’s the plan—each week, I will blog about a different song, focusing, usually, on the lyrics, but also on some other aspects of the song, including its overall impact—a truly subjective thing. Therefore, the best part, I would hope, would not be anything in particular that I might have to say, but rather, the conversation that may happen via the comments over the course of time—and since all the posts will stay up, you can feel free to weigh in any time on any of the songs! With Grateful Dead lyrics, there’s always a new and different take on what they bring up for each listener, it seems. (I’ll consider requests for particular songs—just private message me!)\n\n“Desolation Row”\n\nA new book is coming out very soon from Simon & Schuster, who are also my publishers. It’s a collection of the lyrics of Bob Dylan, in a definitive edition complete with variant versions of the words, scholarly essays, and, possibly, some degree of annotation—the working title for several months had been The Complete Annotated Bob Dylan Lyrics. The actual title is now The Lyrics: Since 1962, and the publication date is October 28. I plan to buy a copy—although not the autographed version, which goes for $5,000. It checks in at a shipping weight of over 15 pounds, 916 pages, and is roughly the size of an LP. Comes in a grey slipcase.\n\nPartly in honor of this publishing event, my first thought was to feature a post on the Bob Dylan covers the Dead slipped into their repertoire over the years. Clearly, calling Dylan an influence on the Dead is an understatement.\n\nThe Grateful Dead Lyric and Song Finder lists 39 songs by Dylan played by the Dead. Of those, a large number are performances of the Dead backing Dylan on their joint tour. But there are 11 or 12 songs that were staples of the Dead’s own repertoire. And of those, there are a number that were played often enough to be considered favorites of the band. “It’s All Over Now, Baby Blue,” was played 145 times. “Queen Jane, Approximately”: 129. “All Along the Watchtower”: 123. “Knockin’ On Heaven’s Door”: 76. But for me, the quintessential Dylan song performed by the Dead was always “Desolation Row,” which was performed only 58 times.\n\nThere’s so much in the song—such a torrent of words, and it seemed to go on so long at time that it was almost humorous. I remember hearing an anecdote about the Dead/Dylan tour, during which Dylan called for “Desolation Row,” and Weir asked him if he remembered all the words. “I’ll remember the ones that matter,” was Dylan’s reply.\n\nI did submit a book proposal for a Complete Annotated Bob Dylan Lyrics, and the sample song I annotated was “Desolation Row.” So I have spent some time with the song, although I could not stand up in front of a crowd and sing it beginning to end without forgetting any words, I’m certain of that. The word count comes in at 665. To compare, “China Cat Sunflower” has less than 100 words. Of course, that’s a simplistic point in many ways—a seventeen syllable haiku can contain worlds of meaning, after all.\n\nBut I think that it was something about the sheer volume of words, of references, of visuals and unseen plots and relationships contained within those words that lent the song a part of its meaning. As if Dylan was saying—look, everyone: the world, our country with its unsavory history, and our place in it and everyone’s place in it, is not something that you can just summarize in a neat sentence. It’s extremely complicated, and deserves your consideration on as deep a level as you might care to take it to.\n\nSo, just for fun, I’m going to post my annotated version of the lyrics to “Desolation Row,” as this week’s “Greatest Stories Ever Told” entry. I’ll enjoy hearing your reactions, additions, and most importantly, corrections!\n\nDesolation Row [1]\n\nThey're selling postcards of the hanging[2]\n\nThey're painting the passports brown[3]\n\nThe beauty parlor is filled with sailors\n\nThe circus is in town\n\nHere comes the blind commissioner\n\nThey've got him in a trance\n\nOne hand is tied to the tight-rope walker\n\nThe other is in his pants\n\nAnd the riot squad they're restless\n\nThey need somewhere to go\n\nAs Lady [4] and I look out tonight\n\nFrom Desolation Row\n\n-------------------------------------------------------\n\n[1] Desolation Row\n\nFinal track of Highway 61 Revisited. Recorded August 4, 1965.\n\nDesolation Row was listed as song number 185 in Rolling Stone’s top 500 songs of all time list.\n\nIn 1969, Dylan told Rolling Stone he wrote this song in the back of a New York cab. … It was spliced together from two consecutive takes during the last sessions for Highway 61. (RS Dec. 2004)\n\nFirst performed at the Forest Hills Music Festival in Queens, New York on August 28, 1965.\n\nDylan spoke to USA Today's Edna Gundersen about the song on September 10th, 2001: “And Desolation Row? That's a minstrel song through and through. I saw some ragtag minstrel show in blackface at the carnivals when I was growing up, and it had an effect on me, just as much as seeing the lady with four legs.\"\n\nThe Grateful Dead covered the song for a number of years in live performances, and when they teamed up with Dylan for the Summer 1987 Dylan and the Dead tour, Weir asked Dylan if he thought he could remember all the words to “Desolation Row,” before they launched into it. Dylan replied, “I’ll remember the ones that matter.” (For the record, Weir sometimes left out a verse here and there when they sang it.)\n\nThe song’s title contains at least two, and possibly a third, references. First to be called to mind is the Jack Kerouac novel, Desolation Angels, published in 1965. The novel had its origins much earlier, written around the same time as the publication of On the Road. The largely autobiographical work, in turn, takes its title from Desolation Peak, in Washinton State’s Cascade Mountains, where Kerouac was stationed as a fire lookout, and his journal from that period provided the basis for the novel.\n\nThe second reference is to Nobel Prize winner John Steinbeck’s Cannery Row, published in 1945, which follows the misadventures of a down-and-out group of Great Depression era residents of the Monterey, California neighborhood.\n\nLastly, this song, with its myriad of literary, biblical, and popular culture references, has something in common with the T.S. Eliot (mentioned in the song) masterwork, “The Waste Land,” and the two titles evoke the same stark landscape. Eliot’s poem dates from 1922, and is 434 lines in length. So numerous and obscure were the reference’s in Eliot’s work, that he himself provided footnotes to the poem.\n\n[2] postcards of the hanging\n\nThis entire verse points toward events in Duluth, Minnesota, Dylan’s hometown, which occurred on June 15, 1920. (Side note: Duluth, like the song itself, is at the end of Highway 61.) Three African-American circus workers were lynched by a mob of residents when they were accused, falsely, as it turned out, of raping a local girl. The incident made national headlines. The James Robinson circus arrived in town on the previous day. Following that evening’s performance, 19-year-old Irene Tusken and a companion, 18-year-old James Sullivan, accused six circus workers of threatening Sullivan at knife-point and raping Tusken. No physical signs of assault were found when Tusker was examined by her family physician the following morning; nevertheless, the six workers were arrested and jailed. A mob of 5,000 to 10,000 stormed the jail and took three of the accused men for a mock trial where they were found guilty. Elias Clayton, Elmer Jackson, and Isaac McGhie were taken to the corner of 1st Street and 2nd Avenue East, where they were lynched. Postcards were printed of the lynched bodies, and sold.\n\nThe making of postcards of lynchings was not unique to Duluth’s dark day, however. Dylan’s influence by Billie Holiday is documented in the film “No Direction Home,” and she made the song “Strange Fruit,” by the Jewish poet and songwriter Abel Meeropol, famous in 1939, singing it at the close of many of her concerts for the next 20 years, and recording it in 1939 and 1944. “Strange Fruit” became the anthem of the movement against lynchings.\n\n“Postcards of the Hanging” is the title of a 2002 compilation CD of performances of Bob Dylan songs by the Grateful Dead.\n\n[3] painting the passports brown\n\nU.S. Government Agents’ passports are brown instead of blue.\n\nAlso the title of a recording by Bruce Russell, released in 2001.\n\n[4] Lady and I\n\nPossibly a reference to Billie Holiday, whose nickname was Lady Day. Hence, both Dylan and Holiday looked out at, and sang about, the hangings by mobs.\n\nCinderella[5], she seems so easy\n\n\"It takes one to know one,\"[6] she smiles\n\nAnd puts her hands in her back pockets\n\nBette Davis[7] style\n\nAnd in comes Romeo[8], he's moaning\n\n\"You Belong to Me I Believe\"[9]\n\nAnd someone says,\" You're in the wrong place, my friend\n\nYou better leave\"\n\nAnd the only sound that's left\n\nAfter the ambulances go\n\nIs Cinderella sweeping up\n\nOn Desolation Row\n\nNow the moon is almost hidden\n\nThe stars are beginning to hide\n\nThe fortunetelling lady\n\nHas even taken all her things inside\n\nAll except for Cain and Abel[10]\n\n-------------------------------------------------------\n\n[5]Cinderella\n\nAn ancient, archetypal figure in folk literature, found throughout the world. The character embodies one who is wrongly discounted, whose true attributes are unknown or unappreciated, but who eventually proves everyone wrong by virtue of great success. Dylan’s son, Jakob, used the character in his Wallflowers song “One Headlight”: “But me & Cinderella / We put it all together / We can drive it home / With one headlight.”\n\n[6]It takes one to know one\n\n\"Only a person with identical character traits would be able to recognize those traits in someone else. Often used as a curt rejoinder to deflect an accusation; you're only saying that about me because it's true of you. Originated in the late nineteenth or early twentieth century.\" From Random House Dictionary of Popular Proverbs and Sayings by Gregory Y. Titelman (Random House, New York, 1996)\n\n[7]Bette Davis\n\nApril 5, 1908 – October 6, 1989. American actress. The “style” of putting her hands in her back pockets seems to derive from her habit of leaving her thumbs out.\n\n[8]Romeo\n\nCharacter from Shakespeare’s play “Romeo and Juliet,” whose ill-fated love for the daughter of a rival family, Juliet, led to a tragic end for both of them.\n\n[9]You Belong to Me\n\nEchoes of the 1965 Dylan song title “She Belongs to Me,” from “Bringing It All Back Home.”\n\n[10]Cain and Abel\n\nBiblical characters: the two sons of Adam and Eve. Cain murdered Abel, and when he was questioned about Abel’s whereabouts, asked if he was his brother’s keeper. The Biblical story of Cain and Abel is found in Genesis 4:8 ff.\n\nAnd the hunchback of Notre Dame[11]\n\nEverybody is making love\n\nOr else expecting rain[12]\n\nAnd the Good Samaritan,[13] he's dressing\n\nHe's getting ready for the show\n\nHe's going to the carnival tonight\n\nOn Desolation Row\n\nNow Ophelia,[14]she's 'neath the window\n\nFor her I feel so afraid\n\n-------------------------------------------------------\n\n[11]The hunchback of Notre Dame\n\nCharacter from the 1831 Victor Hugo novel, translated into English as The Hunchback of Notre Dame, whose name was Quasimodo. The novel’s original title in French was Notre Dame de Paris. He was born with “defomities”—a huge wart over one eye, and a hunchback, and was left as a foundling on the cathedral’s doorstep, on a Quasimodo Sunday, which is the first Sunday after Easter in the Catholic calendar. He is adopted and brought up as the cathedral bell-ringer, and loses his hearing as a result.\n\n[12]Expecting rain\n\nUsed as the title of an early Bob Dylan fansite (www.expectingrain.com), created in 1995.\n\n[13]Good Samaritan\n\nThe parable is found in the Gospel of Luke, chapter 10, verses 25–37.\n\n“On one occasion an expert in the law stood up to test Jesus. \"Teacher,\" he asked, \"what must I do to inherit eternal life?\". \"What is written in the Law?\" he replied. \"How do you read it?\" asked Jesus. The man answered: \" 'Love the Lord your God with all your heart and with all your soul and with all your strength and with all your mind'; and, 'Love your neighbor as yourself.'\" \"You have answered correctly,\" Jesus replied. \"Do this and you will live.\" But he wanted to justify himself, so he asked Jesus, \"And who is my neighbor?\" In reply Jesus said: (the parable starts here) \"A man was going down from Jerusalem to Jericho, when he fell into the hands of robbers. They stripped him of his clothes, beat him and went away, leaving him half dead with no clothes. A priest happened to be going down the same road, and when he saw the man, he passed by on the other side. So too, a Levite, when he came to the place and saw him, passed by on the other side. But a Samaritan, as he traveled, came where the man was; and when he saw him, he took pity on him. He went to him and bandaged his wounds, pouring on oil and wine. Then he put the man on his own donkey, took him to an inn and took care of him. The next day he took out two silver coins and gave them to the innkeeper. 'Look after him,' he said, 'and when I return, I will reimburse you for any extra expense you may have.' \"Which of these three do you think was a neighbor to the man who fell into the hands of robbers?\" The expert in the law replied, \"The one who had mercy on him.\" Jesus told him, \"Go and do likewise.\"” New International Version/p>\n\n[14]Ophelia\n\nCharacter in William Shakespeare’s play, Hamlet (ca. 1599-1601). Ophelia is Hamlet’s beloved, daughter of Polonius, whom Hamlet slays, leading to Ophelia’s insanity and subsequent death by drowning. The name “Ophelia” was not in use prior to Shakespeare’s coinage. The reference to “her sin” being “her lifelessness” may be a reference to the “unforgiveable sin” of suicide in Catholic dogma.\n\nOn her twenty-second birthday\n\nShe already is an old maid\n\nTo her, death is quite romantic\n\nShe wears an iron vest\n\nHer profession's her religion\n\nHer sin is her lifelessness\n\nAnd though her eyes are fixed upon\n\nNoah's great rainbow[15]\n\nShe spends her time peeking\n\nInto Desolation Row\n\nEinstein,[16] disguised as Robin Hood[17]\n\nWith his memories in a trunk\n\nPassed this way an hour ago\n\nWith his friend, a jealous monk\n\nHe looked so immaculately frightful\n\nAs he bummed a cigarette\n\nThen he went off sniffing drainpipes\n\nAnd reciting the alphabet\n\nNow you would not think to look at him\n\nBut he was famous long ago\n\nFor playing the electric violin\n\nOn Desolation Row\n\nDr. Filth, he keeps his world\n\nInside of a leather cup\n\nBut all his sexless patients\n\n-------------------------------------------------------\n\n[15]Noah’s great rainbow\n\nFollowing the great flood, God placed a rainbow in the sky as a promise to Noah, who had built and stocked an ark with a pair of each animal, that never again would the world be destroyed by water.\n\n[16]Einstein\n\nAlbert Einstein, physicist who promulgated the Theory of Relativity. 1879-1955.
