I therefore gladly agreed [to the request to travel to the United States with a Zionist delegation], without debating for more than ﬁve minutes, although I had just turned down all the American universities. This therefore is rather an act of loyalty than one of disloyalty. The prospect of erecting a Jewish university in particular ﬁlls me with special joy, since I have recently seen numerous examples of the perﬁdious and loveless manner in which one treats splendid young Jews and seeks to sever their educational possibilities. I could also list other events of the past year that would have to drive a selfrespecting Jew to take Jewish solidarity more seriously than seemed proper and natural in earlier days.\n\nA few days later Einstein reiterated in a letter to his close friend Heinrich Zangger: “On Sunday it’s off to America. Not only to speak at universities, which will happen as well, but for the founding of the Jewish university in Jerusalem. I feel the keen need to do something for this cause.” Thus, Albert Einstein, who had received numerous invitations to lecture in America over the preceding few years, traveled from Berlin via the Netherlands in the spring of 1921 with a full agenda and schedule: he would spend most of his time accompanying Chaim Weizmann on a tour of East Coast cities, making numerous, brief appearances at large gatherings intended to arouse enthusiasm for the Jewish colony in Palestine and its planned cultural and educational institutions. In addition, Einstein was to deliver a series of lectures at Princeton University on his contributions to modern physics. Einstein had been propelled to international fame in the fall of 1919, at age forty, with the conﬁrmation of his general theory of relativity by two\n\nx ) Foreword\n\nteams of British astronomers who had observed the 1919 solar eclipse and produced evidence conﬁrming Einstein’s prediction of light bending in the vicinity of massive objects. He had been celebrated as the greatest physicist of the twentieth century on the front pages of all major American and European newspapers. As one of only a handful of German scientists who had publicly criticized Germany’s war aims, Einstein could have expected to travel to former Allied countries without fearing overt anti-German sentiment. Since the end of World War I, however, he had not been ofﬁcially invited except by formerly neutral or Central power European countries, such as Holland, Switzerland, and Austria. Although the British Royal Astronomical Society had considered awarding him their Gold Medal in 1920, the nomination had ultimately failed to gain the majority needed, and Einstein’s planned trip to England to receive this honor had been canceled. During 1920, Einstein received several invitations to teach or lecture in America. He toyed with the possibility of an extended lecture tour and exchanged letters with representatives of Columbia University, the University of Wisconsin, Harvard University, Princeton University, and the National Academy of Sciences in Washington, D.C. By the end of the year, Einstein was even studying English pronunciation and was expecting to travel soon to the United States. But by early 1921, it had become clear that, in the climate of postwar economic hardships, not even American institutions of higher learning could come up with the ambitious sum of ﬁfteen thousand dollars that Einstein was hoping to be paid for his U.S. lectures. Distinguished European scientists had begun traveling to America in the previous two decades, received enthusiastically by an academic community eager to adopt the practice of research-oriented scientiﬁc education that had taken hold, primarily at German universities, since the late nineteenth century. Physics, and theoretical physics in particular, had experienced extraordinary growth in Germany since Hermann von Helmholtz, Felix Klein, Max Planck, and other distinguished physicists had started the intellectual revolution leading eventually to quantum physics and relativity, ﬁelds in which Einstein had made his most remarkable and lasting contributions between 1905 and 1915. It had been customary for American students to travel to the great chemical and physical laboratories of Berlin or Leipzig for postgraduate work and then to return and recast American science departments at MIT or Caltech on the model of German higher\n\nForeword ) xi\n\neducation, emphasizing independent research as an integral component of scientiﬁc education. At the 1904 World’s Fair in Saint Louis, a stellar gathering of European scientists had delivered comprehensive lectures on the state of science at the turn of the century, among them Max Weber, Jacques Loeb, and Wilhelm Ostwald. A year later, the eminent Austrian physicist Ludwig Boltzmann returned to the United States and ventured as far as Berkeley and the newly founded Stanford University, where he lectured in English and was frequently entertained by muniﬁcent donors, among them Mrs. Hearst and Mrs. Leland Stanford. In an essay published that same year as “Trip of a German Professor to Eldorado,” Boltzmann gave a vivid and entertaining account of his summer sojourn in California, of American railroads, restaurants, prohibition, and the ubiquitous presence of a Euclid Avenue in every city. Boltzmann was most impressed by the giant telescope of the Lick Observatory and the entrepreneurial spirit of American scientists and their supporters and less impressed by the students in his class, whom he found only modestly prepared to deal with integrals and differentials. Over the ensuing years, many other European physicists accepted invitations to lecture at major American universities engaged in the new progressive movement of social, economic, and increasingly vibrant educational reform. With these reforms came growth in federal support of science. In the early 1900s, through the efforts of the newly founded American Physical Society and scientists at Princeton, Columbia, Wisconsin, Harvard, Cornell, and other institutions, physics departments expanded their laboratories, faculty, and student enrollment, and “as though to symbolize the vitality of American physics, in 1907 Albert Michelson won his Nobel Prize in physics.”* By 1914, the new atomic physics discovered in England and on the Continent was being taught at Princeton, at Chicago (where Robert Millikan carried out his famous oil-drop experiments), at Harvard, and elsewhere. Support for scientiﬁc research was growing through private funding agencies, such as the Carnegie Institution, and industrial research laboratories at companies such as AT&T, DuPont, Westinghouse, and General Electric\n\n*For a detailed account of the development of American physics in the years before and after Einstein’s visit, see especially Daniel J. Kevles, The Physicists: The History of a Scientiﬁc Community in Modern America (Cambridge: Harvard University Press, 1995), 79.\n\nxii ) Foreword\n\nwere increasingly attracting talented young physicists. But it was the outbreak of World War I that propelled American science onto its path of ascendancy and into the preeminent position it was to occupy for the rest of the twentieth century. The war caused a major rupture in international scientiﬁc relations, with wide-ranging repercussions for the further development of science. With the recruitment by all belligerent countries of engineers, chemists, and physicists in the service of the most devastating and technologically advanced conﬂagration in history, the reestablishment of scholarly exchanges among former enemy nations after 1919 was a slow, cautious process, fraught with resentment for many. Marie Curie, the two-time Nobel Prize winner in chemistry and physics (who had introduced x-ray machines on ambulances on the French front), was received triumphantly on May 20, 1921, at the White House, where she was presented with a gift of one gram of radium by President Harding. Einstein, however, was not invited but had to content himself with meeting Harding as part of a delegation of scientists. Even two years after the end of the war, his German origin and residence caused many ofﬁcials to be cautious. Nevertheless, as the articles so conscientiously collected and humorously annotated by Dr. Illy in the present volume indicate, many representatives of local and state governments and of academic establishments along the East Coast sincerely welcomed Einstein. During his U.S. travels, Einstein spent considerable time in New York City and also visited New Brunswick, Washington, D.C., Chicago, Princeton, Boston, New Haven, and Cleveland. He lectured at the College of the City of New York, Columbia, Princeton, the American Academy of Arts and Sciences, and the Zionist Society of Engineering and Agriculture. From the more than 160 newspaper reports contained in this comprehensive collection, however, one senses that he tried hardest to explain to reporters and the general public, invariably through an interpreter, the essence of his theory of relativity, its signiﬁcance, and its usefulness. This collection highlights the creation of the public image of Einstein, and of relativity, at the hands of the press, the public, and of Einstein himself. His physical and emotional attributes, his pleasant, jocular, and at times exasperated demeanor, his professorial attire and peculiarities, his eating habits and opinions on America were all dissected, reported, and repeated. Einstein’s wife, Elsa, is also fully present in many articles. She appar-\n\nForeword ) xiii\n\nently served as Einstein’s interpreter on numerous occasions and also made her own mark with the press and the various dignitaries they encountered. Her English skills were evidently much better than Einstein’s, and she relished entertaining, recounting anecdotes, and replying to many questions regarding Einstein’s work habits in Berlin, his tastes and preferences, his likes and dislikes. She comes across as an energetic, determined woman, the worldly companion to the maladroit savant. The two months that Einstein spent in the United States cemented his status as the scientiﬁc icon of the twentieth century. Einstein later embarked on a few similar long journeys, to Japan and the Far East and to South America. He returned to America a decade later as a visiting scientist at Caltech for three successive winters, starting in January 1931. In early 1933, while Einstein was in Pasadena, Hitler’s Nazi regime made Einstein’s return to Germany impossible. His ﬁfth and last transatlantic journey brought Einstein to New York in the fall of 1933, when he took up his last academic position as a member of the newly founded Institute for Advanced Study in Princeton, where he spent the last two decades of his life. The United States had become his third home country, a country that he supported wholeheartedly during World War II but whose misdeeds during the McCarthy era he criticized equally vigorously. During the interwar years he had served the cause of international reconciliation and paciﬁsm and had thrown the weight of his scientiﬁc reputation behind the cause of oppressed and disenfranchised Eastern European Jews. He joyously welcomed the founding of the State of Israel in 1948 but continued to advocate tirelessly on behalf of peaceful coexistence and cooperation between Jews and Arabs. After 1945 the press and the world saw Einstein as the “father of the atomic bomb,” on which he in fact never worked. He continued to feel a weight of responsibility for the devastations of Hiroshima and Nagasaki and devoted the last decade of his life to promoting the civilian control of nuclear energy and international nuclear disarmament.

Buchwald General Editor and Director The Einstein Papers Project\n\nThis page intentionally left blank\n\nPreface ) Sing of Einstein’s Yiddishe peachtrees, sing of Sleep among the cherryblossoms. Sing of wise newspapers That quote the great mathematician: A little touch of Einstein in the night— —William Carlos Williams, “St. Francis Einstein of the Daffodils” (First Version), 1921\n\nWhen Einstein joined Chaim Weizmann’s tour of the United States in 1921 to gain support among American Jewry for the Zionist cause, his role was to raise funds for the establishment of Hebrew University. Although news coverage of the trip frequently focused on Weizmann’s ﬁerce disputes with the leaders of American Zionism, I concentrate on Einstein for three reasons. First, in spite of Weizmann’s leading role in the organization and aims of the trip, the central ﬁgure in the American and English-language Zionist press reports was Einstein, who just two years previously had gained worldwide celebrity because of a successful test of his general theory of relativity. As one journalist put it, “There is reason to believe that Prof. Einstein was induced to accompany the mission in the hope that his presence would act as a ‘tail to the kite.’ And now, lo and behold, contrary to all calculations (except, perhaps, those based on the theory of relativity), the tail has become the whole kite.” Second, Einstein did not participate in the ﬁerce debate between the Weizmann-led World Zionist Organization and the leaders of the Zionist Organization of America (the “Brandeis-group”), although Einstein\n\nxvi ) Preface\n\nfollowed the debate and supported the views of Weizmann. The two salient points of the debate were (1) whether to build up the Jewish national home in Palestine with private (Brandeis) or public funds (Weizmann’s Keren Hayesod) and (2) whether the Zionist organization should have a federal system with independent member organizations (Brandeis) or the Zionist Congress should be a parliament exerting central control (Weizmann). (You see the parallel with the federalist and unionist viewpoints in American history!) Weizmann won the debate in Cleveland with the help of the majority of American Jews, the “Easterners” (i.e., those with roots in Eastern Europe), against the ofﬁcial leaders of American Jewry, who were mostly “Westerners” (i.e., of ancestry from Germany). A third reason for concentrating on Einstein is somewhat subjective. Working for the Einstein Papers Project, I have learned that one should be careful with newspaper accounts. As historical scholars, we collect each scrap of newspaper with Einstein’s name in it, but when forming scholarly conclusions, we turn to them only as a last resort. As a result, we now have a sizable collection of clippings, with interesting interviews, events, and commentaries. We keep them in big, black steel cabinets that protect them from ﬂoods, ﬁres, earthquakes, and the eyes of readers, I fear. As a conservation-minded person, I cannot tolerate this waste of intellectual treasure and interesting reading. A few words about the news reports presented herein. I had to use microﬁlm copies of the originals, often on the edge of legibility; hence transcription was the only feasible option for their presentation. Names are another problem. The reporters recorded the names by following their ears. Weitzmann, Weisemann, or Weizmann? These variants cause no trouble because their contexts show they all stand for the name of a well-known person, Chaim Weizmann. But what about Bernstein/Burstein, Hurwitz/Hurevitz, Levin/Lewine, Timen/Teaman? I have left the spelling variants untouched and apologize if any ﬁnd their ancestors’ names misspelled. You might well wonder whether Einstein really was the kind of Zionist that the journalists portrayed. For a recent discussion of this fundamental issue, please see the seventh volume of The Collected Papers of Albert Einstein.\n\nPreface ) xvii\n\nI enjoyed gathering these materials. I hope you will enjoy reading them, even if not everything that was reported on Einstein is true. Indeed, you may ﬁnd pleasure in unraveling the roots of the errors—as did I.

Bergmann asked Einstein to join a fundraising mission to the United States for the Palestine Foundation Fund (Keren Hayesod).1 Einstein’s earlier informal talks with German Zionists and his public statements in the press were a strong indication that an invitation in the university matter would not fall on deaf ears. Indeed, four days after Chaim Weizmann, president of the World Zionist Organization, had sent a telegram to Kurt Blumenfeld, a leading German Zionist, asking him to invite Einstein on his behalf to join the mission,2 Blumenfeld sent the following reply: “Einstein prepared to join you for America letter follows.”3\n\n2 To Visit America )\n\nFebruary 21\n\nProf. Einstein to Visit America Berlin, Feb. 21—Prof. Albert Einstein, distinguished scientist, whose theory of relativity has evoked tremendous interest throughout the world, will come to America next month with the Zionist delegation. It is announced that he will appeal to Jews of America for support of the Hebrew University to be erected on the Mount of Olives.

He comes to lecture on his theory. By Elias Tobenkin Too much nationalism—that is the disease from which mankind is suffering to-day. To become normal again the world must return to its pre-war internationalism. Such is the diagnosis of Europe’s and the world’s ills by Germany’s foremost physical scientist, Albert Einstein, discoverer of the Einstein theory of relativity. I had come to Prof. Einstein to hear what he had to say about the “plight of German science,” a subject which just then occupied much space in the newspapers of Berlin. Prof. Einstein, however, spoke not of science but of humanity. “Of course,” he said, “science is suffering from the terrible effects of the war, but it is humanity that should be given ﬁrst consideration. Humanity is suffering in Germany, everywhere in Eastern Europe as it has not suffered in centuries. “Humanity,” he continued, “is suffering from too much and too narrow a conception of nationalism. The present wave of nationalism, which at the slightest provocation or without provocation passes over into chauvinism, is a sickness.\n\n4 ) Albert Meets America\n\n“The internationalism that existed before the war, before 1914, the internationalism of culture, the cosmopolitanism of commerce and industry, the broad tolerance of ideas, this internationalism was essentially right. There will be no peace on earth, the wounds inﬂicted by the war will not heal, until this internationalism is restored.” “Does this imply that you oppose the formation of small nations?” “Not in the least,” he replied. “Internationalism as I conceive it implies a rational relationship between countries, a sane union and understanding between nations, mutual coöperation, mutual advancement without interference with a country’s customs or inner life.” “And how would you proceed to bring back this internationalism that existed prior to 1914?” Science and Internationalism “Here,” he said, “is where science, scientists, and especially the scientists of America, can be of great service to humanity. Scientists, and the scientists of America in the ﬁrst place, must be pioneers in this work of restoring internationalism. “America is already in advance of all other nations in the matter of internationalism. It has what might be called an international ‘psyche.’ The extent of America’s leaning to internationalism was shown by the initial success of Wilson’s ideas of internationalism, the popular acclaim they met with the American people. “That Wilson failed to carry out his ideas is beside the point. The enthusiasm with which the preaching of these ideas by Wilson was received shows the state of mind of the American public. It shows it to be internationally inclined. American scientists should be among the ﬁrst to attempt to develop these ideas of internationalism and to help carry them forward. For the world and that means America also, needs a return to international friendship. The work of peace cannot go forward in your own country, in any country, so long as your Government or any Government is uneasy about its international relations. Suspicion and bitterness are not a good soil for progress. They should vanish. The intellectuals should be among the ﬁrst to cast them off.” There are two men in Germany today who are traditionally inaccessible to newspaper men. One is the ﬁnancier Hugo Stinnes. The other is Einstein.\n\nTo Visit America (February 21–April 1) ) 5\n\nEinstein has been greatly abused by a section of German press and he therefore shuns publicity. He lives in a quiet section of Berlin on the top ﬂoor of a fairly up-to-date apartment house. His study consists of a reception room, or rather a conference room, and of his private workroom. The walls of the conference room are lined with books of a general character. The large number of English books is especially noticeable. There is an edition de luxe of Dickens in English, and a costly Shakespeare edition in German. Alongside of Shakespeare stands Goethe in a similarly luxurious edition. Einstein is an admirer of both Goethe and Schiller, and has the busts of the two poets prominently displayed. Adjoining the conference room is a large music room. When he is not in his study, Mrs. Einstein told me, her husband is in the music room. Music and cigars are the scientist’s only relaxations. The number of cigars he smokes is controlled by Mrs. Einstein for his health’s sake, but there is no control over the amount of time he chooses to spend at the piano or with his violin, for he plays both instruments well. His workroom is exceedingly simple. There is a telescope in it. The windows give an exceptionally good view of the sky. There are also a number of globes and various metal representations of the solar system. There are two engravings of Newton on the walls. They are the only pictures in the room. The table he works at is simple and rather small. There is a small typewriter, which is used by his secretary. Einstein has a large correspondence, receiving on an average sixty letters a day. His Bursts of Concentration He was pacing up and down the room as I entered his study. He was dressed in a pair of worn-out trousers and a sweater coat. If he had a collar on, the collar was very unobtrusive, for I cannot recall having seen it. He was at work. His hair was dishevelled and his eye had a roving look. His wife told me that when the professor is seized by a problem the fact becomes known to her by this peculiar wandering look which comes into his eyes and by his feverish pacing up and down the room. At such times, she said, the professor is never disturbed. His food is brought to him in his workroom. Sometimes this mode of living lasts for three or four days at a time. It is when the professor rejoins his family at the table that they know that his period of intense concentration and abstraction is over. After such a period of concentration, Einstein often rests himself by\n\n6 ) Albert Meets America\n\nreading ﬁction. He is fond of reading Dostoyevsky. He walks a lot through the parks and in the summer often goes out with his family in the ﬁelds. But he is never asked by his wife or children to go for a walk. It is he who has to do the asking and when he asks them for a walk they know that his mind is relieved of work. His hours of work are indeﬁnite. He sometimes struggles through a whole night with a problem and goes to bed only late in the morning. Dr. Einstein asked whether he could not see a copy of my interview with him before it was printed. I told him that I would not write the interview until after my return to America. “In that event,” he said, “when you write it, be sure not to omit to state that I am a convinced paciﬁst, that I believe that the world has had enough of war. Some sort of an international agreement must be reached among nations preventing the recurrence of another war, as another war will ruin our civilization completely. Continental civilization, European civilization, has been badly damaged and set back by this war, but the loss is not irreparable. Another war may prove fatal to Europe.” The New York Evening Post, March 26.\n\nThe article was “advertised” in the Graphic Section, part 4, p. 1 of the New York Evening Post. The famous fourteen points of Woodrow Wilson on the self-determination of small nationalities and on a League of Nations were accepted with enthusiasm by the American public, but in 1918 he failed in convincing Congress to accept the Peace Treaty of Versailles. Einstein’s being “abused by a section of German press” is a hint at the attacks against him and his theory by a group of German physicists and journalists in 1920. He and those on his side were accused of making propaganda for his theories and exerting “mass suggestion.” Tobenkin also mentions Einstein’s secretary. At the time Einstein was the director of the Institute of Physics of the Kaiser Wilhelm Society. But one should not think of a big institution with laboratories and an extensive array of instruments: Einstein’s lab was actually the den in his own apartment, and the secretary was his elder step-daughter, Ilse Einstein.\n\nThe Rotterdam on the Einsteins’ card to Paul Ehrenfest, March 24, 1920: “Dear Ehrenfest! It’s so ﬁne in the land of milk and honey where our only duty is to ﬁnd the proper table where we are supposed to eat. Today, however, Zion appears with all its seriousness. Now we enter the Big Ditch. See you in Leyden. With best regards to you all. Your Einstein.” (I have not translated Elsa Einstein’s note.)4 Courtesy Albert Einstein Archives 73-256.\n\n8 ) Albert Meets America\n\nMarch 30\n\nProf. Einstein Will Arrive Here April 2 Famous Exponent of Theory of Relativity Coming in Interest of Zionism. Professor Albert Einstein, exponent of the theory of relativity, will arrive in this city April 2 on the steamship Rotterdam. He will be accompanied by Dr. Chaim Weizmann, formerly professor of chemistry in the University of Manchester and president of the International Zionist Organization. The two are coming to this country in the interest of Zionism. It was announced yesterday by the Zionist Organization of America. Mayor Hylan yesterday appointed a representative committee to greet the party. On the committee named are Benjamin Schlesinger, George Gordon Battle and Nathan Strauss. John Dewey, now in China, was also appointed to the welcoming committee by the Mayor. A mass meeting and reception have been arranged for Sunday afternoon, April 10, at the Metropolitan Opera House. The New York Call, March 30, p. 2.\n\nApril 1\n\nPlan Celebrations in Honor of Visiting Zionist Leaders Dr. Weizmann, Prof. Einstein and Other Zionist Heads to Reach United States Sunday— Meeting to Be Held Here Sunday—Clevelanders Arrange Gathering for Margolies Memorial Hall—Reception in Honor of Guests to Be Held April 6 and 10 in New York—Mayor Hylan Names Committee With the expected arrival in the United States Sunday of Dr. Chaim Weizmann, president of the World Zionist Organization, Dr. Albert Einstein, renowned scientist and discoverer of the principle of relativity, M. M. Ussichkin and Dr. Mossensohn, Zionists in many cities throughout the land are planning celebrations in honor of the visit of the distinguished Zionist leaders. This is the ﬁrst visit of Dr. Weizmann. The party is reported to have left England March 24. In honor of their arrival a meeting will take place here [in Cleveland] Sunday afternoon at 2 o’clock at the Margolies Hall on E. 55th street. Jo-\n\nTo Visit America (February 21–April 1) ) 9\n\nseph Barondess is expected to be one of the speakers and addresses will also be made by Isaac Carmel, Rabbi Benjamin and Rabbi Schussheim. It is expected that the Zionist leaders will visit Cleveland during their stay in the United States and at a conference held last Saturday evening a committee was named to get in touch with the Cleveland Zionist District heads and arrange for a joint council representing all organizations, that would plan a reception for the visitors. Clevelanders are also planning to attend a celebration in honor of the visitors that is to take place April 6 at the 69th Regiment Armory. Another public reception will take place Sunday, April 10, at the Metropolitan Opera House under the auspices of the Zionist Organization. Mayor Hylan has appointed a citizens’ committee to participate in the reception. Nathan Straus and Judge Julian W. Mack will be prominent among those receiving the guests. Prof. Einstein’s visit is in the interest of the Hebrew University to be established in Jerusalem. Dr. Einstein was born in Switzerland in 1879 and has held professorships at Zurich, Prague and Berlin. His work in connection with the subject of relativity brought him world wide fame as a scientist. Among the New Yorkers who initiated the movement for a popular reception to Professors Weizmann and Einstein and the other members of the delegation are Judge Gustav Hartman, grand master of the I.O.B.A., who is chairman of the committee, Reubin Branin, Louis Lipsky, Rev. Masliansky, Joseph Barondess, Jacob Ish-Kishor, Rabbi Margulies, Dr. Elias Solomon, David Pinsky, Baruch Zuckerman, Professor M. M. Kaplan, Morris Rothenberg, Bernard A. Rosenblatt, Bernard G. Richards, Judge Jacob S. Strahl, Ezekiel Rabinowitz, Yehoash, Sholom Asch. The Jewish Independent, April 1, p. 1.\n\nEinstein was born in Germany, not in Switzerland. Reconciling his Swiss citizenship with his prestigious position in Berlin proved to be a hard nut for journalists to crack. The abbreviation “I.O.B.A.” stands for “Independent Order of B’rith Abraham” (Abraham’s Covenant), a fraternal society founded by American Jews of Eastern European descent (i.e., “Easterners”). See its “Western” counterpart, the Independent Order of B’nai B’rith (Sons of the Covenant) on p. 257.\n\n10 ) Albert Meets America\n\nWhat happened aboard the Rotterdam? The journey was the ﬁrst opportunity for Weizmann to meet Einstein in person. “I never met Professor Einstein before this voyage,” said Professor Weizmann, who is a great admirer of his fellow-scientist. “He has a singularly sweet and lovable nature, and is exceedingly simple in his habits of life. I have talked with him many times about his work, and he is glad to speak of it when he can ﬁnd some one who is interested and at least partly capable of understanding it. I do not entirely, for when I get beyond the atom I am lost. “When he was called ‘a poet in science’ the deﬁnition was a good one. He seems more an intuitive physicist, however. He is not an experimental physicist, and although he is able to detect fallacies in the conceptions of physical science, he must turn his general outlines of theory over to some one else to work out. That would be readily understandable to a man of science. He ﬁrst became interested in mathematics when he was 14 years old, and his work is his life. He spends most of his time reading and thinking when he is not playing his violin.” The New York Times, April 3, p. 13.\n\nEinstein played the violin even aboard the ship. On the ship, when a concert was held Dr. Einstein played selections from Mozart, of whose work he is particularly fond, on the violin. Brahms is another of his favorites. The New York Times, April 3, p. 13.\n\nBut the journey was also the ﬁrst opportunity for Einstein to meet the very attractive and intelligent Mrs. Weizmann. Einstein could not resist her charms. Vera Weizmann turned to Elsa Einstein, asking whether she was embarrassed by Einstein’s ﬂirting with her. Elsa’s answer was soothing for Vera and surprising for us: “Intellectual women did not attract him. Out of pity he was attracted to women who did manual work.”5 The New Palestine, the ofﬁcial weekly of the Zionist Organization of America, announced the event and introduced the members of the mission.\n\nTo Visit America (February 21–April 1) ) 11\n\nOver 5,000 people are expected to attend the mass-meeting of welcome which is being given on April 10th to Dr. Chaim Weizmann, president of the World Zionist Organization, and his associates, who are expected to arrive in this country on the Rotterdam, on Sunday, April 3rd. Accompanying Dr. Weizmann are Prof. Albert Einstein, famous for his theory of relativity, who is coming here in the interest of the Hebrew University, M. M. Ussischkin, head of the Zionist Commission in Palestine; Dr. Ben Zion Mossensohn, principal of the Jaffa Gymnasium, Gerson Agronsky, head of the Zionist Commission Press Bureau, Solomon Ginsburg, son of the famous Jewish philosopher Asher Ginzburg (Achad Ha’am), and L. Stein of the London Zionist ofﬁce. Hon. Nathan Straus is honorary chairman, and Judge Julian W. Mack is chairman of the committee on arrangements which includes the leaders of every phase of American Jewish life. A cablegram of greeting to Dr. Weizmann and the Zionist delegation expressing the wish that their negotiations with the American Zionists meet with success, was received by the New York ofﬁce from the Central Zionist Committee of Warsaw, and signed by Messrs. Klumel, Greenbaum, and Podlishewski. It read: “Greet Zionist Delegation with Weizmann at head. With success their work. East European Jewry and tens of thousands all over the world are ready to work in Palestine. We await the speediest beginning of the great colonization activity, and hope for the best results of your work.” The New Palestine, April 1, p. 1.\n\nIn the following article, I omit the part that introduces Weizmann and Ussischkin.\n\nAbout the Life and Zionist Activities of Weizmann, Ussischkin and Einstein . . . Prof. Albert Einstein, the son of a German Jewish family, was born in 1879 in Ulm, Wurtemberg. He spent his schooldays in Munich where he attended a gymnasium. From 1896 to 1900 he studied mathematics and physics at the Technical High School in Zurich, Switzerland. Originally he intended to become a school teacher, but having meanwhile become naturalized, he obtained a post as Engineer in the Swiss Patent Ofﬁce. The main\n\n12 ) Albert Meets America\n\nideas involved in the most important of Einstein’s theories date back to this period. In 1909 he became “extraordinarius” Professor at the University of Zurich. Later he was called to Prague, Bohemia, to become Professor Ordinarius. In 1913–1914 he accepted a similar chair in Zurich Polytechnicum, when he received an invitation to the Prussian Academy of Science, Berlin. It was in Berlin where he completed his work of “General Theory of Relativity” (1915–1917). Professor Einstein also lectured on various special branches of physics at the University of Berlin and was Director of the Institute for Physical Research of the Kaiser Wilhelm Gesselschaft. He has pledged his services to the Hebrew University in Jerusalem, and it is in the interest of that institution that he is coming here.

M. Ussischkin, member of the International Zionist Committee, on the Rotterdam of the HollandAmerica Line, they will be greeted at quarantine by a committee appointed by Mayor Hylan. Jewish Legionnaries who fought in Palestine will march to Pier 2, Hoboken, where the Rotterdam is to dock, to take part in a reception in which it is expected that several thousand persons will participate. The committee has requested that all Jewish sections of the city be decorated in honor of the visitors. An ofﬁcial meeting of welcome will be held on the steps of City Hall on Tuesday. Among those who will speak are Mayor Hylan, Former Assistant Secretary of State Frank L. Polk, George W. Wickersham and Magistrate Bernard A. Rosenblatt. The American Zionist organization will tender a reception to Professor Einstein, Professor Weizmann and Mr. Ussischkin in the Metropolitan Opera House on Sunday evening, April 10. Nathan Straus is Honorary Chairman and Magistrate Rosenblatt Chairman of the committee appointed by the Mayor. This committee will go down the bay this morning to greet the visitors and bring them to the\n\n14 ) Albert Meets America\n\nHoboken piers.

The New York Times, April 2, p. 11.\n\nProf. Einstein Here, Explains Relativity “Poet in Science” Says It Is a Theory of Space and Time, But It Bafﬂes Reporters—Seeks Aid for Palestine—Thousands Wait Four Hours to Welcome Theorist and His Party to America A man in a faded gray raincoat and a ﬂopping black felt hat that nearly concealed the gray hair that straggled over his ears stood on the boat deck of the steamship Rotterdam yesterday, timidly facing a battery of cameramen. In one hand he clutched a shiny briar pipe and with the other clung to a precious violin. He looked like an artist—a musician. He was. But underneath his shaggy locks was a scientiﬁc mind whose deductions have staggered the ablest intellects of Europe. One of his traveling companions described him as an “intuitive physicist” whose speculative imagination is so vast that it senses great natural laws long before the reasoning faculty grasps and deﬁnes them. The man was Dr. Albert Einstein, propounder of the much-debated theory of relativity that has given the world a new conception of space, and time and the size of the universe. Dr. Einstein comes to this country as one of a group of prominent Jews, who are advocating the Zionist movement and hope to get ﬁnancial aid and encouragement for the rebuilding of Palestine and the founding of a Jewish university. He is of medium height, with strong built shoulders, but an air of fragility and self-effacement. Under a high, broad forehead are large and luminous eyes, almost childlike in their simplicity and unworldliness.\n\nProf. Einstein Here (April 2–3) ) 15\n\nThe Einsteins on board the Rotterdam on arrival in New York. Library of Congress, courtesy AIP Emilio Segrè Visual Archives.\n\nThousands Welcome Him With him as fellow-travelers were Professor Chaim Weizmann, President of the Zionist World Organization, discoverer of trinitrotoluol, and head of the British Admiralty laboratories during the war; Michael Ussichkin, a member of the Zionist delegation to the Paris Peace Conference and now Resident Chairman of the Zionist Commission in Palestine, and Dr. Benzion Mossinson, President of the Hebrew Teachers’ Organization in Palestine. The party was welcomed at the Battery by thousands of fellow-Jews who had waited there for hours. The crowds were packed deeply along the Battery wall, waving Jewish ﬂags of white with blue bars, wearing buttons with Zionist inscriptions, and cheering themselves hoarse as the police boat John F. Hylan drew near.\n\n16 ) Albert Meets America\n\nDozens of automobiles were parked near the landing, and when the welcoming committee and the visitors had entered them they started uptown to the Hotel Commodore, preceded by a police escort. They turned into Second Avenue, where the sidewalks were lined nearly all the way uptown with thousands who waved hands and handkerchiefs and shouted welcome to the visitors. Professor Einstein was reluctant to talk about relativity, but when he did speak he said most of the opposition to his theories was the result of strong anti-Semitic feeling. He was amused at attempts by reporters to get some idea of his theory by questioning him, and he did his best to make his answers as simple as possible. He spoke through an interpreter. A Theory of Space and Time The interview took place in the Captain’s cabin, where Professor Einstein was almost surrounded by seekers after knowledge. He was asked to deﬁne his theory. “It is a theory of space and time, so far as physics are concerned,” he said. “How long did it take you to conceive your theory?” he was asked. “I have not ﬁnished yet,” he said with a laugh. “But I have worked on it for about sixteen years. The theory consists of two grades or steps. On one I have been working for about six years and on the other about eight or nine years. “I ﬁrst became interested in it through the question of the distribution and expansion of light in space; that is for the ﬁrst grade or step. The fact that an iron ball and a wooden ball fall to the ground at the same speed was perhaps the reason which prompted me to take the second step.” He was asked about those who oppose his theory, and said: “No man of culture or knowledge has any animosity toward my theories. Even the physicists opposed to the theory are animated by political motives.” When asked what he meant, he said he referred to anti-Semitic feeling. He would not elaborate on this subject, but said the attacks in Berlin were entirely anti-Semitic. Dr. Einstein said the theory was a step in the further development of the Newtonian theory. He hoped to lecture at Princeton on relativity before he left the country, he said, as he felt grateful to the Faculty of Princeton, which was the ﬁrst college to become interested in his work.\n\nProf. Einstein Here (April 2–3) ) 17\n\nPoses for Moving Picture Men As the questioners gave up their attempts to seek further elucidation of the Einstein principles, the professor laughed and said: “Well, I hope I have passed my examination.” Professor Einstein’s interview came soon after he had escaped the moving picture men. As they ground away at their machines, ordering him about, he seemed at ﬁrst bewildered, then amused. He posed with other members of his party and with Mrs. Einstein for nearly half an hour, and then almost ran away, shaking his head in exasperation and refusing to do any more. “Like a prima donna,” he exclaimed. “He does not like to be what you call it, a showcase,” said Mrs. Einstein. “He does not like society, for he feels that he is on exhibition. He would rather work and play his violin and walk in the woods.” “Do you understand his theory?” Mrs. Einstein was asked. “Oh, no,” she said, laughing, “although he has explained it to me so many times. I understand it in a general way, but in its details it is too much for a woman to grasp. But it is not necessary for my happiness.” Dr. Einstein was an inspirational worker, she said. When he was engaged in some problem, “there was no day and no night,” but in his periods of relaxation he went for weeks without doing anything in particular but dream and play on his violin. Whenever he became weary in the midst of his work he went to the piano or picked up his violin and rested his mind with music. “He improvises,” she explained. “He is really an excellent musician.” [Then come passages on Weizmann’s impression on Einstein and on Einstein’s preferences in music, which have already appeared on p. 10.] Professor Weizmann also is accompanied by his wife. He and the other Zionist visitors, during their visit of several weeks, will endeavor to interest American Jews in the Zionist movement and obtain money and moral support for both the national Zionist idea and for the university. Dr. Weizmann Explains Mission “It is a great satisfaction to me as President of the Zionist Organization to ﬁnd myself for the ﬁrst time in the United States,” said Dr. Weizmann. “The cause of the Jewish national home in Palestine has from the ﬁrst appealed to the generous instincts of the American people and owes much to\n\n18 ) Albert Meets America\n\nthe sympathetic support it has consistently received from leaders of public opinion in the United States. “Our primary object is to confer with the American Zionists who have, under the distinguished leadership of Justice Brandeis, Judge Mack and other representative American Jews, rendered invaluable services to the Zionist movement during the past few critical years. In the task of reconstruction in Palestine for which the time has now arrived, it is conﬁdently expected that the American Zionists will play an equally conspicuous and honorable part. In this connection we hope to enlist the active interest of American Jews in the Keren Hayesod, or Foundation Fund, the central fund for the building up of the Jewish National Home, to which Jews throughout the world are being called upon to contribute to the utmost limit of their resources. “Professor Einstein has done us the honor of accompanying us to America in the interest of the Hebrew University of Jerusalem. Zionists have long cherished the hope of creating in Jerusalem a centre of learning in which the Hebrew genius shall ﬁnd full self-expression and which shall play its part as interpreter between the Eastern and Western worlds. Professor Einstein attaches the utmost importance to the early inauguration of the Jerusalem university and is prepared when the time arrives personally to associate himself within its activities—a course in which there is reason to hope he will be followed by other Jewish scholars and scientists of worldwide reputation.” Einstein to Work for University Professor Einstein will devote most of his time while here to advocating support of the university by American Jews. [The New York American, April 3, p. 5, quoting the same statement, introduces it with the following two paragraphs:] Through Captain Tulin, who acted as interpreter, Professor Einstein said: “The object of my visit to America is to assist the Zionist organization to secure the support, both material and moral of American Jewry for the Hebrew university of Jerusalem. “The establishment of such a university has been for a long time one of the most cherished plans of the Zionist organization,” he said. “But for the outbreak of the war it would have materialized in 1914, when a site was\n\nProf. Einstein Here (April 2–3) ) 19\n\nactually purchased on the Mount of Olives. In 1918 the foundation stone was laid by Dr. Weizmann. Since then the university site has been extended and a building purchased in which it will be possible for a beginning to be made. There is also a library of 30,000 volumes which is rapidly growing. “Plans have been worked out both for the complete university of the future and for a comparatively modest beginning. The time has now come to insure the immediate realization of the latter. Such is the importance attached by the Zionist Organization to the spiritual values in the Zionist national home that even at this moment, when the organization is faced with tremendous tasks of immigration and colonization, and is concentrating all efforts upon the Palestine Foundation Fund, an exception is made in favor of the university to which a special branch of the fund is devoted. “I know of no public event which has given me such delight as the proposal to establish a Hebrew university in Jerusalem. The traditional respect for knowledge which Jews have maintained intact throughout many centuries of severe hardship made it particularly painful for us to see so many talented sons of the Jewish people cut off from higher education and study, and knocking vainly at the doors of universities of Eastern and Central Europe. Home for Spiritual Life “Others who have gained access to the regions of free research only did so by undergoing a painful, even dishonoring, process of assimilation which crippled [the free and natural development of the spiritual character of our people, the New York American adds] and robbed them again and again of their cultural leaders. The time has now come when our spiritual life will ﬁnd a home of its own. Distinguished Jewish scholars in all branches of learning are waiting to go to Jerusalem, where they will lay the foundation of a ﬂourishing spiritual life and will promote the intellectual and economic development of Palestine. [The New York American adds the following sentence:] “Our Hebrew University of Jerusalem will become the spiritual centre not only of Palestine but also of the Jewish people scattered all over the world. “Notwithstanding the crude political realism of our times and the materialistic atmosphere in which it has enveloped us, there are visible none the less glimmerings of a nobler conception of human aspirations, such as\n\n20 ) Albert Meets America\n\nwere expressed in the part played by the American people in world politics. And so we come from sick and suffering Europe with feelings of hope, being convinced that our spiritual aims will command the full sympathy of the American nation and will receive enthusiastic approval and powerful support from our Jewish brethren in the United States.” The Zionists were met down the bay by a delegation from the Mayor’s committee of welcome, Captain Abraham Tulin, who served as American liaison ofﬁcer with General Mangin’s army in the war; Dr. Schmarya Levin, who was member of the ﬁrst Russian Duma and of the Cadet Party in Russia; and Magistrate Bernard Rosenblatt. They were delayed by the quarantine examination and were not able to board the Rotterdam until nearly 1 o’clock. On the way up the bay they had lunch with Professor Einstein, Professor Weizmann and others in the party, and remained with them on the ship until sundown. As it was the Sabbath their religion prevented them from leaving until that time. Crowd Waits Four Hours at Pier At the pier were several hundred welcomers, although the ship was more than four hours late in reaching her pier. They gave the Zionists a rousing welcome before they went aboard the police boat John F. Hylan, which landed them at the Battery. The boat ﬂew the Jewish ﬂag in honor of the party. On board were L. Lipsky, Secretary of the Zionist Organization of America; L. Robison of the National Executive Committee; B. G. Richards, Secretary of the American Jewish Congress; M. Rothenberg, Chairman of the American Jewish Congress; J. Fishman, managing editor of The Jewish Morning Journal; W. Edlin, editor of The Day; Rabbi M. Berlin; David Pinski, editor of Die Zeit; John F. Sinnott, Secretary to Mayor Hylan; Henry H. Klein, Commissioner of Accounts; Judge Gustave Hartman, the Rev. H. Masliansky, Judge Jacob S. Strahl and many others. An ofﬁcial meeting of welcome will be held at the City Hall on Tuesday, at which Mayor Hylan, Frank L. Polk, George W. Wickersham, Magistrate Rosenblatt, Professor Einstein and Professor Weizmann will speak. Among those on the Committee of Welcome are Nathan Straus, Arthur Brisbane, Chancellor E. E. Brown, Judge Benjamin Cardoza, Abram I. Elkus, James A. Foley, F. H. LaGuardia, Justice Samuel Greenbaum, William D. Guthrie, Mrs. William R. Hearst, Adolph Lewisohn, Alfred H. Smith, Leon Kaimaky, Judge Otto A. Rosalsky, Benjamin Schlessinger, Oscar S.\n\nProf. Einstein Here (April 2–3) ) 21\n\nStraus, Senator Nathan Straus Jr., Marcus Loew, Dr. Bernard Flexner, Colonel Robert Grier Monroe, Herman Bernstein, Samuel Koenig and George Gordon Battle. A meeting also will be held at the Metropolitan Opera House on April 10. Professor Einstein will not touch on relativity at these meetings, but it is expected that before he leaves the city he will speak before some scientiﬁc gathering at which he will discuss his discovery. The New York Times, April 3, pp. 1, 13.\n\nOther members of the delegation were Solomon Ginzberg (later Shlomo Ginossar), son of the famous Jewish philosopher Asher Ginzberg (later Achad Ha’am) and secretary of the University Fund and (on this occasion) Einstein’s personal secretary,; Gerson Agronsky, head of the Zionist Commission Press Bureau; and Weizmann’s personal assistant, Leonard Stern. Shmarya Levin joined the mission in New York. “Our immediate impression of the reception awaiting us in America was far from heartening,” Vera Weizmann remembers. “Very few of the ‘notables’ were there to greet us; but thousands of Jews from Brooklyn and the Bronx came on foot to the harbour to welcome us, and we stayed there for a few hours until Shabbath was over.”6 The makeup of the delegation shows that the “notables” missing were of the so-called Brandeis group, the top leaders of the Zionist Organization of America (ZOA). Nevertheless, there was Julian Mack, president of the ZOA, and Louis Lipsky, Weizmann’s strongest ally in his campaign for the Palestine Foundation Fund (Keren Hayesod) in America. This was the ﬁrst time that Weizmann was mysteriously referred to as the “inventor of TNT.” “ ‘It was in vain that I systematically and repeatedly denied any connection with, or interest in, TNT’—Weizmann writes.—‘The initials seemed to exercise a peculiar fascination over journalists, and I suppose high explosive is always news.’”7 (The solution of the “mystery” is on p. 28.) My sense is that the reporters noted a signiﬁcant asymmetry between Einstein’s and Weizmann’s scientiﬁc achievements and wanted to attribute a discovery to Weizmann as important as Einstein’s relativity.\n\n22 ) Albert Meets America\n\nAccording to the New York Call (see below), Einstein’s and Weizmann’s interviews were given on the motorboat John F. Hylan on the way from the steamer to the shore and not on board the Rotterdam. The invitation by Princeton University to deliver a series of lectures there in the winter of 1920 was sent to Einstein on October 1, 1920, through Professor Luther P. Eisenhart, who as a specialist in the ﬁeld of differential geometry was able to appreciate Einstein’s theory of general relativity in its full depth.8\n\nEinstein Here with Weizmann to Aid Zionism Only Opposition to Theory of Relativity, the Professor Says, Came from Politicians One of the world’s great scientists, Professor Albert Einstein, author of the theory of relativity, arrived on the Rotterdam yesterday as a member of the delegation which has come to this country in the interests of Zionism. With him were Professor Chaim Weizmann, president of the World Zionist Organization; M. M. Ussischkin, a member of the international Zionist committee, and Ben Zion Mossesohn, a leading educator of Palestine. The delegation, with Mrs. Einstein and Mrs. Weizmann, were met at the pier in Hoboken yesterday after sundown by a committee of prominent Jews aboard the police tug John F. Hylan. They were landed at the Battery. Here, amidst a ﬂurry of cheers and ﬂags, a small parade formed and a chain of taxicabs whisked the visitors to the lower East Side which turned out en masse to greet them, to the Hotel Commodore. Crowded in the little cabin of the John F. Hylan, Professor Einstein talked to reporters in the trip from Hoboken to the Battery and described the long years of effort through which he had worked out his theory. He spoke only German, and his words were interpreted by everyone in the vicinity who could understand him. Talks in German The distinguished physicist is a broadly built man who looks more the artist than the scientist. He has a ﬁne, graying head with the hair falling loosely back from his high forehead when he removes his hat. His coloring is warmly brown, the features prominent, the eyes and mouth friendly. He\n\nProf. Einstein Here (April 2–3) ) 23\n\nseemed to take a childlike amusement in the whole process of questioning and scribbling and interpreting that was going on before him, but all the while felt about him the large simplicity of the scientist who deals with vast spaces and elemental things. When ﬁrst asked to explain his theory of relativity, Professor Einstein, who has previously said that there were only a few people in the world capable of understanding it, laughed gayly. Then he began to put it into as exact German as his hearers could understand. “It is a theory of space and time as far as physics is concerned, which leads to a deﬁnite theory of gravitation,” he said. “The theory consists of two steps.” Professor Einstein explained that he had worked on the ﬁrst step for seven years and on the other for eight or nine years. He was drawn to this research through the expansion of light in space and through the fact that iron and wooden balls fall to the ground with the same degree of acceleration in spite of the law of gravitation. “I believe that this theory is a step further than Newton’s law of gravitation, in regard to deﬁniteness as well as to method,” he continued. Opposition Political Asked about the opposition which had manifested itself after his announcement of the theory of relativity, Professor Einstein said it had been purely “political.” No real scientist has any prejudice against his theory. What opposition there was the noted scientist explained partly on the ground of anti-Semitism, and partly on the ground of “politics.” Professor Einstein said he had come to this country to secure help for the establishing of a Zionist university in Jerusalem. He hopes to lecture in it some day when the dream is realized. At present his plans are uncertain, though he expects to lecture at Princeton because it is the ﬁrst American university that has asked him. Weizman, Jewish Hero A little earlier Dr. Weizmann, in the midst of an eager crowd on the rear deck of the boat, explained the purposes of the delegation in visiting America and what the Zionist leaders hope to accomplish in Palestine. Dr. Weizmann, formerly professor of chemistry in the University of Manches-\n\n24 ) Albert Meets America\n\nter, is both scientist and statesman and is a hero among the Jewish people for his success in the game of diplomatic chess at the peace conference and afterward. While he was not prepared to say that the British Government favored an independent Jewish state in Palestine, Weizmann said that the ideal of a Jewish national home ultimately meant a state. 1,000 Come to Zion Monthly Immigrants are coming into Palestine now at the rate of about 1,000 a month, Dr. Weizmann said. Most of them are from eastern Europe—Russia, Rumania, the Ukraine—young, unmarried men who have been through the war. At present there are 100,000 Jews and 500,000 Arabs in Palestine, he said. Three languages are used ofﬁcially—English, Hebrew and Arabic. The committee appointed by the Mayor to greet the visitors was headed by City Magistrate Bernard A. Rosenblatt. Included in the representatives from Jewish organizations who were on board the John F. Hylan were Commissioner of Accounts Henry H. Klein; Judge Julian W. Mack, president of the Zionist Organization of America; David Pinski, editor of Die Zeit; Judge Gustave Hartman and others. The City Delegation The Zionist delegation boarded the tug from the Lackawanna pier in Hoboken. A committee composed of Judge Hartman, Magistrate Rosenblatt, Alderman Louis Zeltner, Louis Lipsky, B. Zuckerman and Captain Abraham Tulin, with roses for the ladies of the party, went ashore to greet the visitors and escorted them back to the boat. Returning to the Battery, the delegation was greeted with cheers and ﬂag waving by a crowd of several hundred persons who had gathered in Battery Park. While searchlights from harbor craft played over the water the visitors stepped ashore and walked through an archway fairly papered with small ﬂags, to the waiting automobiles. Before setting out Magistrate Rosenblatt spoke a few words of welcome to the visitors in behalf of Mayor Hylan. Then the procession started, while a band struck up the Hatikvah or Jewish national anthem, and piled up beyond the darkness the lights of the city glittered with inﬁnite allurement. Escorted by a group of Jewish legionaires who fought under General Allenby in Palestine, the automobiles swept through the lower East Side, by\n\nProf. Einstein Here (April 2–3) ) 25\n\nZionist Leaders Greeted by Vast Throng at Their Arrival in New York. “Vast throngs of New York Jews turned out to greet Professor Chaim Weizmann, discoverer of T.N.T. and president of the World Zionist Organization, and Professor Albert Einstein, famous savant, upon their arrival here on the S.

The brow of his massive bald head was ﬁnely etched with veins, his eyes were piercing, his moustache and goatee elegant, his clothing always superbly tailored.”9 A description of their wives is on pp. 124–128. It seems that Weizmann succeeded in convincing Einstein to accept a future appointment at Hebrew University, although Einstein’s “promise” sounds rather cryptic; a few months earlier he had deﬁnitely rejected this possibility, if only for the reason that he could not speak Hebrew. In fact, he never lectured there. The New York American gives other details of the events below.\n\nCity Welcomes Prof. Einstein and Weizmann Discoverer of Theory of Relativity and President of Zionists of World Hailed by Motor Fleet—Big Reception Tuesday—Hylan Committee Heads Welcomers Down Bay—Distinguished Jews Here to Aid Palestine A ﬂoat of motorboats, loaded with men and women, welcomed Dr. Chaim Weismann, president of the Zionist Organization of the World, and Professor Albert Einstein, discoverer of the theory of relativity, when they arrived here from Europe yesterday. The welcomers were headed by Mayor Hylan’s Committee of Welcome appointed to greet the world-famous Jews. Hundreds of automobiles were waiting in Battery Park when the Police Boat John F. Hylan landed the distinguished visitors at 7 P.M. These fell into line behind the Welcome Committee machines and escorted the visitors to the Hotel Commodore, the parade moving uptown through the East Side. Thousands in Bowery Cheer A noisy and picturesque feature of the welcome at Battery Park was a contingent of the Jewish Legion, which fought under General Allenby in the Holy Land campaign, who had a ﬁfe and drum corps with them. Thousands cheered the oars as they passed along the Bowery and up Second avenue.\n\nProf. Einstein Here (April 2–3) ) 27\n\nEinstein in motorcade on the occasion of his arrival in New York City.

Early yesterday the Mayor’s Committee of Welcome, headed by Magistrate Bernard A. Rosenblatt, Captain Abraham Tulin and Dr. Shayrm Levine, went down the bay to meet the steamship Rotterdam. They waited until 1 o’clock before the big liner was permitted out of Quarantine. As soon as the committee piled aboard the ship from the coastguard cutter Guthrie, Mrs. Weizmann effusively greeted Dr. Levine, who was one of the original members of the Russian Duma and expressed her happiness at being in the United States. Refuse to Break Sabbath Though the ship docked during the afternoon, Dr. Weizmann and Professor Einstein refused to break the Jewish Sabbath and travel on Saturday. They remained aboard the vessel at Hoboken until sundown. Then, with\n\n28 ) Albert Meets America\n\ntheir wives and members of their party, they boarded the police boat John F. Hylan, which had been placed at their disposal by Mayor Hylan. They were taken to the Dock Department pier at the Battery, and then, under police escort, to the Hotel Commodore. [Here follows Einstein’s statement on his mission in the United States, which is on pp. 18–19.] Professor Einstein is a member of the Academy of Science of Berlin, and also a professor at the University of Leyden, Holland. He was born in 1879. In 1902 he entered the Swiss patent ofﬁce. In 1905 he received a degree of Ph.D. of Zurich. Since 1913, Professor Einstein, though a Swiss citizen, held a privileged position at the Berlin Academy of Science. His theory of relativity introduced a new scientiﬁc conception of space and time and their relation to the physical world, with important consequences for the theory of light and gravitation. Dr. Weizmann during the war presented Great Britain with the discovery of a method whereby powder could be kept absolutely dry aboard ship. He was born near Pinsk, Russia, in 1874. He was lecturer of chemistry in the University of Geneva, and later reader in bio-chemistry at the University of Manchester. Accompanying the two famous men are Dr. Michael Ussichkin, chairman of the Zionist Commission, and Dr. Benzion Mossinson, president of the Hebrew Teachers’ Association. New York American, April 3, p. 5.\n\nHere it is not TNT but gunpowder that is associated with Weizmann. This guess is closer to the truth, so it is time to reveal what was behind the TNT “mystery.” Before World War I, Weizmann discovered that a bacterium—later named after him—Clostridium acetobutylicum (Weizmann) can turn sugar into acetone and butyl alcohol. When the war broke out, the British Navy was in need of huge amounts of acetone, necessary for the production of smokeless powder, which would enable the warships not to be located by the smoke of their gunﬁre. In Manchester the director of research for Nobel Explosives in Scotland met with Weizmann, who told him about his process. Let me continue with the words of John C. Polanyi, winner of the\n\nProf. Einstein Here (April 2–3) ) 29\n\n1986 Nobel Prize for chemistry. His story is close to what really happened and makes for much better reading than a dry report: “In no time Weizmann found himself on a train to London to be interviewed by the First Lord of the Admiralty. He explained to His Lordship that the bacterium . . . would readily make the necessary tons of acetone provided that a sufﬁciently large fermentation and distillation plant could be found. The First Lord, a Mr. Winston Churchill, explained kindly to Weizmann that he knew some distillers, and though he would not wish to interfere with the supply of whisky he could get Weizmann a gin factory. Weizmann thereupon became chief scientist of the Nicholson Gin Company, and an ally of a politician with an interest in a Jewish National Home in Palestine.”10 After the war, the other end product of the fermentation process, butyl alcohol, also became of high value, being an important component of auto lacquers. With this process Weizmann initiated microbiological methods in industry—an achievement of signiﬁcant technological importance.\n\nEinstein Explains Relativity Theory German Professor Says Discovery Carries Newton’s Law a Step Forward—Work Not Yet Finished—Wife of Scientist Declares the Whole Matter Is Rather Dim to Her NEW YORK, April 2.—Before leaving Berlin Prof. Albert Einstein voiced a prayer that he should not be interviewed in America. But this afternoon he answered all the questions that a groping lot of newspapermen and newspaper women could think of. And one could tell from his chuckling and his willingness to stay until the “worst was over” that he enjoyed it. Thus the originator of the theory of relativity, which several persons profess to understand and a few undoubtedly do, although Mrs. Einstein, who is with her husband, says it’s rather dim to her, surrendered, as they all do, to a great American tradition. Incidentally, he made captive his interviewers at the same time. Prof. Einstein comes here as one of the Zionist commission, whose purpose is to interest American Jews in the restoration of Palestine, and to tell them how it may be done. His special interest is in the establishment of a university in Jerusalem. The head of the delegation is Dr. Chaim Weizman,\n\n30 ) Albert Meets America\n\nformerly professor of chemistry in the University of Manchester, now president of the World Zionist Organization. The two others are M. M. Ussischkin and Ben Zion Mossesohn, head of the Jewish High School at Jaffe. These four, whose arrival has been feverishly awaited by a multitude of Americans, arrived on the Rotterdam. At the Battery the Zionists were met by thousands of men and women and a company of Jewish legionaries who fought under Allenby in Palestine. “Will you deﬁne in simple terms your theory of relativity?” was the ﬁrst question asked. “It is a theory,” the doctor readily replied, “of space and time so far as physics is concerned. It leads to a deﬁnite theory of gravitation. That is all one can say in a few words.” “How long were you in arriving at the theory?” “I am not through yet.” He waved his short, curved-stemmed pipe with a gesture indicating much work ahead. Then he added: “I worked for about sixteen years. The theory has two phases. The ﬁrst one occupied seven years, the second eight or nine.” “And what led you into this ﬁeld of speculation?” “I came to it through a study of the phenomena of the expansion of light through space. That was the ﬁrst phase. The second phase was the observation of the effect of the movement of various bodies. For example, the manner in which they fall to the ground irrespective of their physical nature—the fact that an iron ball and a wooden ball of the same size fall from a given point with the same velocity.” “No man of culture and knowledge has any prejudice against my theory,” he said. “Physicists who do oppose it are animated by political reasons in my opinion. That is due primarily to anti-Semitism. I do not care to say more about that.” “Do you believe you have carried Newton’s law of gravitation a step further?” “Yes,” he answered, after looking at the questioner rather quizzically, it seemed. “I believe it is a step forward in deﬁniteness as well as in method.” He was asked, of course, about the signiﬁcance of his discovery that rays of light were slowed up and bent upon entering a ﬁeld of gravitation. He said: “That merely proves the truth of my theory.” The Public Ledger (Philadelphia), April 3, p. 2.\n\nProf. Einstein Here (April 2–3) ) 31\n\nThe Ledger puts the time at which Einstein was stormed by the newspapermen in afternoon, that is, when the delegation was on board the Rotterdam. I am pretty sure he was interviewed both in the captain’s quarters on the Rotterdam and on the tugboat. The man requested to take charge of Einstein’s press relations was Louis (“Pop”) Popkin. His wife, Zelda Popkin, tells the story of Einstein’s encounter with the journalists as follows: “Pop met Albert Einstein and explained to him that he was about to receive a general press interview. He explained what a press interview was. Professor Einstein winced. ‘I can’t do that,’ he protested. ‘It’s like undressing in public.’ Pop reasoned with him and, as always, was convincing. Einstein was introduced to the ship newsmen. ‘Professor,’ the City News representative rushed in where angels had hesitated, ‘will you be good enough to tell us in one sentence exactly what your theory of relativity is?’” “The professor stared, not believing his ears. ‘All my life,’ he said in German, ‘I have been trying to get it into one book. He wants me to state it in one sentence.’ “ ‘Professor, what do you think of America?’ the Tribune asked. “ ‘Excuse me, I have not yet arrived in America,’ the professor said. “ ‘Professor, what do you think of American women?’ a tabloid reporter asked. “ ‘Excuse me, I have not yet met with American women.’ “ ‘Professor, exactly how will your theory beneﬁt the man in the street?’ the New York Times asked. “The professor looked around for an exit and, like a scared rabbit, he ﬂed. It was a cruel, crude performance. Pop, himself, seemed unhappy whenever he spoke of it.”11 Even though it sounds more like a folk tale than a word-for-word account, it nicely recreates the scene of Einstein besieged by the journalists.\n\nEinstein Explains 2 Phases of Theory Famed Scientist, Through Interpreter, Tells of Discovery That Light Rays Are Bent—Goes Newton One Better—“Iron Ball Can’t Fall Faster Than Wooden One,” He Asserts—Pays Tribute to America\n\n32 ) Albert Meets America\n\nProfessor Albert Einstein, eminent scientist, who has caused worldwide discussion by theories of relativity and bent light, explained his discoveries last night after a cordial welcome to America. Although a Swiss citizen, Professor Einstein spoke in his native German, and it was difﬁcult for him to convey his technical discussion to lay hearers through an interpreter. Equally difﬁcult was it for him to explain the antagonism his theory directed toward him in Germany, forcing him to leave Berlin. His explanation of his science, as translated, follows. “I worked sixteen years on my theory, and I am sure of my ground. Much attention has been given to discussion of my proposition that light in diffusion is bent. Always we had followed the theory that light did not bend. This part of my theory is not of importance, except as an evidence of the entire theory. Two Phases of Theory “There are two steps in my theory. On one I worked for seven years and on the other eight or nine years. I maintain that falling bodies or objects are independent of physical causes. “An iron ball and a wooden ball fall with the same acceleration. My theory is a step in advance of the Newton theory on the law of gravitation. I believe it an advanced step toward deﬁniteness as well as to improvement of scientiﬁc method. “I hope to tell the American people about my theory from the lecture platform. It is very likely my ﬁrst lecture will be in Princeton University, it being the ﬁrst institution to invite me. “You ask me the reason for the attacks upon me in Berlin. Well, no man of science opposes my theory. Such opposition as there has been has had an entirely political origin. Scientist Blames Politics “Even the physicists opposed to my theory are usually animated, in my opinion, by political consideration. Their attitude is largely due to antiSemitism. The attacks in Berlin were entirely anti-Semitic. Then, too, I was a paciﬁst.” When it was announced through the interpreters that the interview was at an end Professor Einstein looked happy and remarked:\n\nProf. Einstein Here (April 2–3) ) 33\n\n“I hope I stood my examination well.” Thereupon the man with a great theory to discuss with the scientists of the world went to the bow of the police boat Hylan and exclaimed at the wonders of the city. He exclaimed: “It is magniﬁcent! Grand America! Grand New York! The one country that shelters my people!” He chatted laughingly with those who could understand his tongue, and they said he was talking boyishly about the treat in store for him in this country. New York American, April 3, p. 3.\n\nPlease note that Einstein spoke German, “although a Swiss citizen.” This led to confusion for some journalists who wondered not why Einstein avoided French, Italian, or Romansh, one of the non-German languages the Swiss use, but why he did not use “the” Swiss language. Einstein had two reasons for using German: ﬁrst, it was his mother tongue, and second, there is no “Swiss” language in the sense that, for example, French people speak the French language. The journalists’ grasp of physics, however, is getting better. Here the balls no longer fall “in spite of the law of gravitation”; now they are only “independent of physical causes.” Another confusing expression is “light in diffusion.” Let’s try not to blame the journalists. Einstein must have used the German expression Lichtausbreitung (light propagation), and, because the literal translation of the word Ausbreitung is “spread out,” it was translated by the casual interpreter as “diffusion,” which roughly means something going outwards in every direction. Maybe the falling balls also lost their physical causes somewhere between Einstein and his interpreter. The enthusiastic exclamation at the end of the article sounds very non-Einsteinian. Maybe it was difﬁcult to understand him because he was being tongue-in-cheek.\n\nEinstein’s Music Excels Science in Wife’s Opinion Professor Albert Einstein has commenced one of the greatest pro and con discussions in the world of science, with his theories of relativity of time and space, but to his wife he is just a plain, music-loving husband.\n\n34 ) Albert Meets America\n\nAfter the arrival of the Rotterdam, which brought Professor Einstein to port yesterday, Mrs. Einstein was asked to describe her husband’s famous theory. Laughingly she raised her hands and exclaimed: “I have known my husband for years, but to tell the truth, I don’t understand about the subject of which all the world is talking. Scientists may— but I—never! I would rather hear him play his violin or his piano than hear him discuss scientiﬁc problems. “I am afraid that he works too hard. But he calls it mere play. Often I do not hear a word from him for days and days. He knows not the difference between night and day. When a problem is put up to him in the work he loves he works days and nights without sleep or food. Then to rest his tired body he will turn to the violin or the piano. “Then I sit and listen to him by the hour—but science—never!” New York American, April 3, p. 3.\n\nThe next article was composed of the two previous ones, but with further details added.\n\nEnthusiastic Reception Is Accorded Zionist Delegation Dr. Weizmann, Professor Einstein and Other Members of Party Greeted by Thousands—New Yorkers Welcome Visitors—Surging Crowd Meets Delegation on Arrival Saturday—Dr. Einstein Issues Statement Explaining Purpose of Visit—Desires Support for Hebrew University of Jerusalem NEW YORK, April 5.—(J. C. B. Service)—Few individuals have ever caused such a stir in the communal life of Greater New York as did the arrival of Dr. and Mrs. Chaim Weizmann, Dr. and Mrs. Albert Einstein, and Menachen Mendel Ussishkin. Thousands gathered at the pier early on Saturday to await the arrival of the Zionist delegation, which did not actually come ashore until after sunset. On landing on New York soil these noted Jews and their party were literally swept off their feet by the surging crowd. On board the S. S. Rotterdam, on which the delegation arrived, the leaders had previously met and entertained a committee representing the Mayor and citizens of New York and other committees representing the Jewish community of the Greater city. The delegation also acknowledged\n\nProf. Einstein Here (April 2–3) ) 35\n\nthe call of numerous newspaper men, as well as the host of cameramen that are always on hand to greet those of any distinction. After the Star Spangled Banner and Hatikvah were sung, it was some time before the cheering subsided and the police succeeded in clearing the road for the procession. In the course of the evening and throughout Sunday members of the delegation which includes also Dr. Benzion Mossinsohn, president of the Hebrew Teachers of Palestine, received numerous visitors and delegations representing various institutions in as well as out of town. In the afternoon the delegates were at lunch with Mr. and Mrs. Samuel Untermeyer at his home. Professor Einstein who made use of an interpreter made it clear at the outset that he is a Swiss and not a German. He was merely born in Germany and is at present professor and a member of the Academy of Science in Berlin. He is forty-two years old, has a decided bent for music and is greatly addicted to the use of a pipe. [Then comes the statement reproduced on pp. 18–19.] The Jewish Independent, April 8, pp. 1, 8.\n\nWhenever the journalists failed to get a short, easy-to-understand account of relativity from Einstein, they turned to Weizmann with the same request, saying, “But you’re a scientist, too.” In the end, “in sheer desperation, we took refuge in an inconspicuous cabin and waited till it was time to go ashore,” remembers Weizmann. After a long and noisy procession through the Jewish section of New York, the delegation arrived at the Hotel Commodore shortly before midnight.12 To land at the Battery and not on the wharves above Greenwich Village was characteristic of grand receptions: “This prerogative of fame began perhaps with Lafayette, who was ofﬁcially received at the Battery in 1824. Of late there have been any number of heroes, and one or two heroines, welcomed at the Battery, celebrities to whom the Mayor of New York, in a snowstorm of ticker-tape, gave the freedom of the city.”13 In this case the snowstorm of ticker-tape was replaced by little American and Zionist ﬂags. Otherwise everything went as usual, even the freedom of the city—although with a hitch. The last program of the day was a small reception.\n\n36 ) Albert Meets America\n\nAn impromptu reception was held in the evening in one of the grill rooms of the hotel. Dr. Weizmann, accompanied by the members of the Delegation, appeared and was most enthusiastically received. Mr. Louis Lipsky, Secretary of Organization, for the Zionist Organization of America, welcomed the leaders on behalf of the Zionists of America and Dr. Weizmann responded brieﬂy, laying especial emphasis upon the duty devolving upon American Jewry to take full advantage of the political facilities which were secured for the restoration of the Jewish Palestine. Speaking for Professor Einstein and Mr. Ussischkin, Dr. Weizmann, the head of the Delegation, expressed the hope that there would be many opportunities for meetings with the Zionists of the country and that before their departure, after their necessarily limited stay in the country, deﬁnite progress toward the achievement of their object would be made. Yidishes Togeblat—The Jewish Daily News, April 5.\n\nWeizmann and Einstein Discuss Plans Special Interviews by Jewish Correspondence Bureau Questioned as to the purpose of his visit, Professor Weizmann declared that he is bringing with him important plans for the rebuilding of Palestine, plans which can only be realized with the entire help of the Jews of America. The European Zionists, Dr. Weizmann said, are at present working under extreme difﬁculties and not only is it essential that American Zionists should concentrate upon the work at hand with all their energies but it is his hope that they will also accord the European workers all necessary encouragement. Pending the meeting of the next congress, Dr. Weizmann said, the newlycomposed executive has reached an agreement regarding all activities. The congress will be called at an early date and preparations for its meeting have already been started. The organization is now looking around for a suitable town and all formalities with regard to the actual elections have already been deﬁned. Asked as to whether he intended to ask American Zionists to enter the executive Dr. Weizmann replied that at this moment this would not be practicable since none of them appear to be in a position to proceed to Europe before June, about which time the next meeting of the Greater Actions Committee will be held.\n\nProf. Einstein Here (April 2–3) ) 37\n\nDr. Weizmann stressed the importance of the work to be done by the Economic Council. The Economic Council, he said, will shortly be registered as a company and although it will work in close touch with the Zionist organization, it will remain entirely independent of the organization. The organization will, however, have two representatives on the Council both of whom will be appointed by Dr. Weizmann himself. Similarly, the ICA will have two of its representatives on the Council. The Council will not collect any funds from the public at large but will concentrate on ﬁnancing deﬁnite projects. It is probable that the Council will also reorganize the existing Zionist banks. Of its income the Keren Hayessod will hand over to the Council that third which is intended for investments. Questioned as to whether he intends to remain at the helm of the Zionist movement Dr. Weizmann said that that was a matter dependent entirely upon the future, adding that he retained the leadership at present upon the sole condition that the next Zionist congress be called forthwith. Questioned regarding the present expenditure in which the Zionist Organization was involved in Palestine, Professor Weizmann stated that the budget was kept within the limits established by Messrs. Julius Simon and Nehemia De Liema, the representatives on the executive who expressed the sentiments of the American Zionist leaders. This budget provides for an expenditure of £14,500 but does not cover immigration. For March £25,000 has been forwarded to Palestine, 10,000 of which will be allotted to immigration work. Professor Albert Einstein, the brilliant scientist who accompanies the Zionist Delegation chieﬂy for the purpose of interesting American Jews in the Hebrew University which is being planned for Jerusalem, when approached, dwelt upon the possibilities of that institution. Einstein believes that the inﬂux of Jewish students into Palestine from every part of the world will convert the Jerusalem University into a Jewish spiritual centre. The Jerusalem University, Einstein said, is not to be compared with any of the developed universities in the western countries. This institution will have to adapt itself to the necessities created by the natural conditions in Palestine. Of prime importance will be an agricultural institute, and possibly also chemical and biological institutes to ﬁght diseases and epidemics. These institutes would be in a position to utilize the existing agricultural\n\n38 ) Albert Meets America\n\nexperimental stations. An essential branch of the work of the university would be an oriental institute to investigate the country, its historical possessions and the local languages. Einstein declared that he looks upon the early inauguration of the university as of the highest importance and in order that it should not be exposed to any arbitrary and private initiative the Keren Hayessod must lay its basis. Lectures, Dr. Einstein said, would not be urgent at the outset in view of the fact that the Jewish population is still comparatively small, but the university will grow with the growth of the population and its teaching activities will be increased accordingly. The establishment of a cultural centre in Palestine, Dr. Einstein believes, will offset Jewish assimilation and will ﬁll Jews everywhere with joy and pride. Dr. Einstein expresses himself as entirely opposed to the idea of accustoming the future students of the Palestine university to one-sided spiritual professions in the manner in which it is at present done in European universities. Yidishes Togeblat—The Jewish Daily News, April 3.\n\nWeizmann, Ussischkin and Einstein Brief Sketches of the World Zionist Leaders Interest in the international Zionist ﬁgures who have just arrived to this country is greater than mere curiosity as to the cause of their visit. American Zionists are anxious to know something about the men who have done so much for Zionism. A brief outline of their work is hereby given. Dr. Weizmann, president of the World Zionist Organization, is a product of the Zionist Movement, having early been active in the Chovevei Zion. A Talmudist and Hebraist from Russia, in early life he went to Switzerland in whose Universities he studied chemistry. He was a lecturer in Chemistry at the University of Geneva and in 1905 he was appointed professor of chemistry at the University of Manchester. Dr. Weizmann had been doing Zionist work all during the period, and he was known in Zionist ranks as the advocate of a project to found a Jewish University in Jerusalem. After the Balfour Declaration, when England had conquered Palestine, and he had interested a number of people in the University project, he acquired land for the University on Mt. Scopus and\n\nProf. Einstein Here (April 2–3) ) 39\n\nlaid there the foundations of the Hebrew University, the science branch of which it is expected will be opened by the end of this year. He was head of the Zionist Commission to Palestine for some time, and to him is ascribed most of the credit for the Zionist diplomatic successes of the past few years, among them the procuring of the San Remo Decision. M. M. Ussischkin has been an ardent Zionist since his youth when, while yet in school, he became one of the members of the “Bilu,” the Jewish National Students’ Organization which formed the ﬁrst Jewish colony in Palestine. Afterwards he was one of the Organizers of the Students’ Chovevei Zion and Ben Zion Conference at Drusgenik, Government of Grodno, and in 1890 he was one of the founders of the Odessa Association for Aiding the Jewish Colonization of Palestine. After the Palestinian scheme had been transformed into the present political Zionist movement, Ussischkin became one of the most ardent followers and collaborators of Herzl with whom he began a correspondence in 1896, and since then he has been one of the most energetic propagandists of Zionists among the Russian Jews. Ussischkin has taken part in all the Zionist Congresses excepting the 6th, and was one of the members of the Zionist Actions Committee. In 1903 he was sent to Palestine by this committee and by the Chovevei Zion to purchase land for new colonies and to organize the colonists and other Jews of Palestine. Ussischkin has been a member of the Zionist Commission, and until his departure for America was head of the Commission. [The newspaper here repeats Einstein’s curriculum vitae, which is on pp. 11–12.] Yidishes Togeblat—The Jewish Daily News, April 3.\n\nOn November 2, 1917, British Foreign Minister Arthur J. Balfour sent a letter to Baron Edmond de Rothschild in which he informed him that “His Majesty’s Government views with favour the establishment in Palestine of a national home for the Jewish people, and will use their best endeavours to facilitate the achievement of this subject.”14\n\n40 ) Albert Meets America\n\nSunday, April 3\n\nEinstein Sees End of Time and Space Destruction of Material Universe Would Be Followed by Nothing Says Creator of Relativity—Theory “Logically Simple”—Science Burdened Hitherto by Complicated Assumptions, He Asserts—Entertains Many Visitors Those persons who may have comforted themselves with the reﬂection that no matter if the worst happened, and everything material in the universe were destroyed, there would still be time and space in which lonesome and expatriated spirits might wander, did not take Professor Albert Einstein into consideration at all. He said jocularly yesterday, having supposititiously destroyed matter by a wave of his hand in which was clutched the omnipresent briar pipe, that under his theory even time and space would then cease to exist. Professor Einstein said it with a smile, attempting to convey by humor to his puzzled interlocutors a conception of relativity which they had failed to grasp in more abstruse deﬁnitions. He is becoming use to having persons ask him to explain what relativity means. It really isn’t as bad as it seems, he explained, and exploded the accepted story that he had said only twelve men in the world were capable of understanding it. He thinks most scientists understand his theories, and added that his students in Berlin understand them perfectly. No theory can be said to be susceptible of absolute proof, he added, and mentioned that an American scientist, St. John, is now conducting experiments which seem to give results at variance with the Einstein theory. “The two theories, that of St. John and my own, have not yet been brought into harmony,” said Professor Einstein. “The subject dealt with is that of the wave lengths in the spectrum. It is impossible at the present stage of the experiments to say what the result will be.” He mentioned this experiment, he said, because he did not wish to seem to claim infallibility for the theory of relativity, and desired to be perfectly fair in his attitude toward the theories of others. The views of Professor Charles Lame Poor, Professor of Astronomy at Columbia, who has said that the Einstein theories cannot be proved and that it is possible to explain all physical phenomena, even the irregularities of Mercury, by Newtonian law, were called to Professor Einstein’s attention.\n\nProf. Einstein Here (April 2–3) ) 41\n\n“I did not see Professor Poor’s statement,” he said. “In a certain sense you can say of any scientiﬁc theory that it cannot be proved. No theory can be proved absolutely. Every theory tries to explain certain facts, and it is acceptable in so far as those facts ﬁt into the general conception of a theory. No facts can be said to be explainable by only one theory, and in that sense one might say that the theory cannot be proved.” Professor Einstein was rather puzzled to account for the public interest in his conception of time and space, and said the public attitude seemed to call for a psychologist who could determine why persons who are not generally interested in scientiﬁc work should be interested in him. “It seems psycho-pathological,” he said with a laugh.
