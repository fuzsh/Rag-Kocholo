        "text": "Although the concept of creative giftedness is still a comparatively new one, the benefits of applying research from this area are already making themselves known. Among these benefits are the tremendous advantages of including creativity in models of giftedness. In this chapter we first highlight how creative giftedness research has differentiated itself from intelligence.\n\nThe degree to which creativity is domain-specific or domain-general remains hotly contested, but there is at least one area of agreement: people have different creativity profiles. In this study, we asked 241 students to give self-ratings of their creativity in different domains. These ratings were then studied for inter-correlations. We also examined how such self-assessments in diverse domains relate to other measures of cognitive ability and to creativity as measured with a personality scale. In general, if students viewed themselves as generally creative, they also viewed themselves as creative in different areas. The only area that was not correlated with general creativity ratings was mathematics.\n\nC REATIVITY is increasingly recognised as a valuable ability that contributes to personal and societal development. It refers to the ability to produce work that is both novel-original and different from commonplace productions – and contextu-ally relevant and valuable (Lubart et al., 2004; Sternberg & Lubart, 1995). It is useful to distinguish three concepts: creative poten-tial; creative accomplishment; and creative talent. Creative potential is a latent ability to produce original, adaptive work; this poten-tial may be more or less high and it can be measured. Creative accomplishment refers to a case of actual production, in which creative potential has been transformed into real-world work that has been recognised as creative by some audience. In comparison, creative talent refers to the tendency to produce creative work on repeated occa-sions. Thus, a person who has a high level of creative potential, who activates this poten-tial and produces creative work on repeated occasion...\n\nHoward Gardner’s theory of multiple intelligence (1983) and Vygotsky's Dynamic Theory of Giftedness (in Wertsch, 1998) two leading psychological thinkers of the modern age, have produced penetrating insights regarding the role of multiple intelligences, creativity, giftedness, human nature, and the therapeutic approach to how we can develop the self-awareness of learners thereby providing the mathematical knowledge of all human beings, looking to mathematics as a category of knowledge being a product of human intelligence and creativity. Although Gardner and Vygotsky together experienced suffering within their own creativity and intelligences and similarly witnessed dramatic socio‐economic changes within the Western Cultural Worldview (Luitel, 2009) they eventually came to espouse radically different psychological theories. Cultivating by those two scholars theories about human endowment, in this article, we tried to address the complex questions of understanding and defining giftedness; focus specifically on the insights about the nature of creativity that we might gain from our lifeworks."
