        "text": "Best of the USA\n\nS 12 Ep 9\n\n4.6\n\n18th May 2015\n\nMike and Edd wrap their American journey with a “Best of the U.S.” episode, highlighting their favorite moments in and out of the stateside shop.\n\nRover P5 B\n\nS 12 Ep 10\n\n7.0\n\n17th Aug 2015\n\nMike and Edd return to the UK for a series of brand new Wheeler Dealers episodes on home turf. In this episode, Mike has unearthed a quintessential piece of British motoring history with a Rover P5 B. The car appears to be in good nick, but Edd’s upgrades won’t be cheap.\n\nJaguar S-Type R\n\nS 22 Ep 6\n\n7.0\n\n30th Aug 2022\n\nMike and Elvis are determined to debunk the idea that you should always discount motors with massive miles.

It’s been a huge success since its launch in 1989 as both a rugged off-road workhorse and practical seven seater family transporter. There are thousands on the road as they are cheap to buy and run so Mike needs to think of a way to make their vehicle stand out. By taking a standard Discovery at a minimal cost he wants to convert it into an expedition vehicle that can fetch double the amount of the standard.\n\nTVR S2 (Part 1)\n\nS 6 Ep 15\n\n7.1\n\n3rd Nov 2009\n\nExpert car trader Mike Brewer and star mechanic Edd China have a job on their hands, getting a TVR and restoring it all for £5000. The TVR S is unmistakable, brutal, basic and British - a real driver’s car. With help from TVR members clubs Mike is told about a good looking TVR on an auction website, but not wanting to bid blind he takes the long trip up to Yorkshire to see it. Liking what he sees he books himself into a local hotel and gets straight on his computer to make the winning bid of £2550. With car in hand he begins the drive back to the workshop but it’s not the smooth drive he was hoping for. As the miles drag on Mike finds out more than just basic maintenance needs to be done to this car.\n\nLand Rover Discovery TDI (Part 1)\n\nS 6 Ep 17\n\n7.1\n\n10th Nov 2009\n\nMike Brewer is looking for one of Britain’s unsung motoring heroes, a Land Rover Discovery. It’s been a huge success since its launch in 1989 as both a rugged off-road workhorse and practical seven seater family transporter. There are thousands on the road as they are cheap to buy and run so Mike needs to think of a way to make their vehicle stand out. By taking a standard Discovery at a minimal cost he wants to convert it into an expedition vehicle that can fetch double the amount of the standard.\n\nJaguar XJS (Part 2)\n\nS 6 Ep 10\n\n7.1\n\n4th Jun 2009\n\nMike and Edd have been working hard on Jaguar’s most famous classic sports car, the XJS. With Mike off finding a new bonnet for the 1989 Jaguar XJS, Edd starts to repair the gearbox mount. They put the used car through its paces and discuss who would want to buy it, and then Mike gets to work advertising the classic car and invites potential buyers to have a look, in the hopes that the final episode might bring them a nice hefty profit.\n\nMini City 1000 (Part 1)\n\nS 6 Ep 13\n\n7.1\n\n27th Oct 2009\n\nThe Mini is a 20th century icon and to celebrate its 50th birthday expert car trader Mike Brewer has got a major plan. Buy a cheap little run about and create a one-off, eye catching, customised Wheeler Dealers special. He’s got up to five grand to spend in total, but first he’s got to find the perfect secondhand motor. There are plenty of Minis out there, all ages and all prices. They need a car with a sound body and engine, so they can spend the money on the fun stuff that will make their car unique. After finding the right Mini for £700 Mike hands it over to Edd to begin the transformation. It is left to Edd to create a celebration model Mini enthusiasts would be proud of, but can he pull it off and make the mini world proud?\n\n1974 Jensen Healey\n\nS 17 Ep 6\n\n7.1\n\n22nd May 2019\n\nMike finds a two-seat convertible roadster for Ant to recondition. With suspension in need of an overhaul and a tatty exhaust, Mike returns to the UK for parts.\n\nAMC Pacer\n\nS 12 Ep 5\n\n7.1\n\n20th Apr 2015\n\nPerhaps the Americas’ biggest automotive joke, the AMC Pacer has long topped lists of the world’s worst cars. But Mike feels this neglected 1970’s hatchback is ready for classic status and he enlists Edd to help make this car cool again. Edd comes up with a visual transformation which he thinks will address the failures of the original styling and attract a 21st Century buyer. But with a limited budget and some very off-the-wall ideas will this gamble land them a big profit or major loss?\n\nTriumph Stag\n\nS 7 Ep 5\n\n7.1\n\n1st Jun 2010\n\nA 70s classic car, the Stag still has an army of fans. Mike decides to find a rust-free car but it’s much harder than he thinks. Edd has to keep prices super-low or there’s no chance the pair will turn a profit on this one.\n\nMorris Minor Traveller 1966\n\nS 10 Ep 5\n\n7.1\n\n19th Mar 2013\n\nThe Morris Minor is like a little piece of England on four wheels. It’s robust, charming and a very useable classic car. In traveller guise, it is also made partly of wood. The car was designed by Alec Issogonis (who also penned the Mini) and was intended as a medium/large family car. It was a massive success and sold more than 1,000,000 units – amazing for a British car. Now the 60s cars are fetching high prices but many are rusty and in poor repair, so finding a good one can be tough. Mike manages to pick one up but then the work begins as Edd strips the car back to nothing but an engine on a bench before restoring a rebuilding it piece by piece.\n\nRolls Royce Silver Spirit\n\nS 23 Ep 5\n\n7.2\n\n17th Apr 2023\n\nMike and Elvis buy a piece of the 'Champagne lifestyle' on a budget - a Silver Spirit that looks past its best. Can they make it turn a profit?\n\nTVR S2 (Part 2)\n\nS 6 Ep 16\n\n7.2\n\n3rd Nov 2009\n\nExpert car trader Mike Brewer and star mechanic Edd China have a job on their hands, getting a TVR and restoring it all for £5000. The TVR S is unmistakable, brutal, basic and British - a real driver’s car. With help from TVR members clubs Mike is told about a good looking TVR on an auction website, but not wanting to bid blind he takes the long trip up to Yorkshire to see it. Liking what he sees he books himself into a local hotel and gets straight on his computer to make the winning bid of £2550. With car in hand he begins the drive back to the workshop but it’s not the smooth drive he was hoping for. As the miles drag on Mike finds out more than just basic maintenance needs to be done to this car.\n\nMG MGB GT (Part 1)\n\nS 2 Ep 9\n\n7.2\n\n12th Mar 2004\n\nMike manages to find an MGB to restore. Mechanic Edd China notes the areas needing the most work: the wheels, engine, bodywork and upholstery.\n\nVolvo P1800\n\nS 7 Ep 7\n\n7.2\n\n19th Oct 2010\n\nA glorious piece of 60s styling, the P1800 is the most surprising Volvo you will ever encounter.
