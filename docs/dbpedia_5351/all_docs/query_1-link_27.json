        "text": "The team behind popular TV motoring series Wheeler Dealers is setting up a new base at Westcott.\n\nThe programme has returned to the UK after six years based in the United States. Production company Betty TV is using the Park as a filming location for the Discovery channel as well as a base for carrying out the comprehensive classic vehicle restoration seen on the series.\n\nThe show continues to be fronted by automotive valuation expert Mike Brewer while a new mechanic, Marc “Elvis” Priestley, has been recruited. Marc previously worked in Formula One in the pit lanes and was in team management at McClaren Racing for almost ten years.\n\nWhile using the various road and runways at Westcott for testing cars, the Wheeler Dealer team also enjoy the Westcott Venture Parks high security. Businesses benefit from CCTV cameras, a nine-mile fence, 24/7 security guards, vehicle barriers and automatic number plate recognition.\n\nWheeler Dealers have also worked with other automotive companies based at Westcott, these include Neil Bainbridge (BS Motorsport) and Top Cats Racing.\n\nJayne Cannell, Westcott business park manager, said: “It is fantastic to be able to welcome the Wheeler Dealers to the Park and I am sure the team will benefit from the fantastic facilities we have here.\n\n“There is a thriving cluster of companies in the automotive sector from engineering to racing and I am sure lots of mutually beneficial relationships will be developed.”\n\nWheeler Dealers, now in its 17th series, takes old vehicles and restores them to their former glory to sell on for a profit. Another series of its spin-off show Dream Car is also in production at Westcott where the team help viewers trade up their vehicles to afford the car of their dreams. The first show at Westcott features the renovation of a 1960s Mini.\n\nDiscovery spokesperson Denize Bellingy said: “Westcott is a brilliant location with plenty of room for testing and filming as well as some beautiful Buckinghamshire countryside.\n\n“We have been made to feel very welcome and are building some excellent relationships with other businesses here.”"
