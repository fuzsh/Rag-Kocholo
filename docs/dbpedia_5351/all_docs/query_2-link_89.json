        "text": "Any other fans of this programme out there ? I'm by no means a competent mechanic, or really not too interested in cars, but I'm entranced by the way Edd makes easy meat of the repairs. You may remember Edd, the mechanic as the man who made journeys in a motorised bed amongst other things !!\n\nYeah I love this shown and have watched it for years when Edd took more of a back seat. Edd and Mike make a good team and you get the impression they are genuine friends in real life. He's a clever lad is Edd, whether it's welding, spraying, rebuilding engines or fabricating!\n\n0\n\nLove the show (although not a big fan of Mike Brewer) and love Edd but the brains behind the whole thing (well the engine and repairs side) is Paul (Paul Brackley) that comes on to help Edd.\n\nHe is the technical director and program consultant of the show and also does all of the work 'off screen'. Paul also sells the cars on ebay from time to time (as most of the buyers are set ups for the camera).\n\nHere is Paul's ebay page http://myworld.ebay.co.uk/pdb61?clk_rvr_id=311546563651&afsrc=1\n\n0\n\nLove the show (although not a big fan of Mike Brewer) and love Edd but the brains behind the whole thing (well the engine and repairs side) is Paul (Paul Brackley) that comes on to help Edd.\n\nHe is the technical director and program consultant of the show and also does all of the work 'off screen'.

I never realised either that some of the buyers were set up.\n\n0\n\nI really enjoy it even tho I'm not mechanically minded.The only thing that annoys me is when they sell the car and he says how much profit they've made, but if you add on the labour costs, they have made a whacking great loss.\n\n0\n\nI really enjoy it even tho I'm not mechanically minded.The only thing that annoys me is when they sell the car and he says how much profit they've made, but if you add on the labour costs, they have made a whacking great loss.\n\nYes that cracks me up about the whole programme.\n\nI like the technical tinkering, but the buying / selling is a complete disaster. If they're lucky they just about come out ahead for the price of the spares they used (but they sometimes make a loss, even on that ). On one of the shows I tried totting up an estimate of the number of hours Edd spent on doing up the motor. Now I appreciate that for most of the viewers, fiddling about and getting oily is part of the fun, but I reckon he spent about 100 hours - in a fully equipped 'shop. That's got to by £3000 ++++ of anybody's money. Then they sold the car and were pleased at the couple of hundred quid they \"made\" on it.\n\nAmazing.\n\n0\n\nGood programme, pity it's mostly faked. The buyers at the end are production crew, family members and such like. And pretty much all the cars end up on Ebay on the account of the off-screen mechanic who does the majority of the work, Edd knows his stuff but he's the face of the programme and doesn't do as much as you might believe. Do some Googling to find out more.\n\n0\n\nits still on Discovery , Discovery Shed , Discovery Turbo and Discovery Real Time.\n\nThe buyers end up with a good bargain although most dont appear all that happy - if it was me I would be well chuffed as the amount of work that goes into it far exceeds the outlay.\n\nSeries 10 will feature a 1970 Fiat Dino, 1992 Morgan +4, 2000 BMW M5, 1977 Renault Alpine A310, 1974 Porsche 914, 1993 Mercedes-Benz G-Class, and a Jaguar XK8.\n\nSeries starts airing on the 20 th of March 2012 and I suspect it will be on the Discovery Channel.\n\n0\n\nThat's interesting, I knew Paul was credited at the end as the mechanic whereas Edd is credited as a presenter, but I thought Edd did the work with help from Paul. I never realised either that some of the buyers were set up.\n\nA shame if they fake the end, why not just sell it on ebay after the show goes out and give a quick update next show. Edd does do a lot on camera, I cannot imagine they stop filming and he washes his hands and says 'Hey Paul take over would you?' Funnily enough Mike has talked about buyers dropping out, the real buyer wouldn't have to talk on camera, just show them kicking the tyres and in the driving seat - then shaking on a deal.\n\n0\n\nThey do in the upcoming series:\n\nhttp://www.ebay.co.uk/itm/1977-Renault-Alpine-A310-sale-/260938323364?pt=Automobiles_UK&hash=item3cc122d5a4\n\nWell after watching the Apline tonight and reading the above eBay listing and this car and classic advert\n\nhttp://www.carandclassic.co.uk/car/C274280\n\nBoth adverts mention\n\n\" New rear suspension bushes - Complete cylinder head and gearbox refurb - Refurbed wheels (acid stripped and powder coated) \"\n\nWhilst in the programme the car never had any of these fitted or work done,and no mention of the cost of these invisible repairs in the final restore value\n\nDo I smell something fishy did Mike B cook the engine ?\n\n0\n\nI do like the series, but always feel let down by the pricing. Mike always looks for a \"do-er Upper\" complains that most cars are way to expensive, finds a banger. Then when he comes to sell, he can never seem to get the car sold for anything like the prices of the cars he couldn't originally buy. And yes in the real world they would of gone bankrupt years ago.\n\nThe Aston DB7 a few weeks ago, couldn't find one for less the 25k or so, then struggled to sell his for 18k (or so, can't remember the exact numbers)\n\n0\n\nI enjoyed the Mk1 Escort prog last night, had a few of these in my youth!\n\nVery easy to work on as everything was so basic back then.\n\nI had no idea they're fetching thousands of pounds now because of their rarity, most of them have rotted away, they were always rust buckets.\n\n0\n\nJust watched the Morris Minor Traveller, and thought they did a good job. But I think a lot of the work went unseen. We never saw the engine go back for a start.\n\nCan't believe it was 2 and a half times more (to buy) than the previous weeks Porsche. :eek:\n\n0\n\nI really enjoy it even tho I'm not mechanically minded.The only thing that annoys me is when they sell the car and he says how much profit they've made, but if you add on the labour costs, they have made a whacking great loss.\n\nToo true! They seem to work on the car for a whole week - which even at cost (35 per hour) on an 8 hour day = £280 a day = £1,400 for a week - and not forgetting Mike's time for touring the country buying parts - plus the fuel.................\n\nThis should come under \"Fantasy TV\"!!!\n\n0"
