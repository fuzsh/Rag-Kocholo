        "text": "If you are a fan of Wheeler Dealers, we have some big news. Current mechanic Ant Anstead is passing the spanner to a new mechanic host, Marc Priestley. Yes, we all love the original show's mechanic Edd China. That said, the show never missed a beat with Ant under the lift.\n\nMike Brewer is still the main host. He is the core of the team and that will hopefully remain true indefinitely. However, the show's location is not fixed. It will be moving from the present location southern California, back to the United Kingdom. Mike Brewer sums up the show's next season by saying, \"The new series will again see Mike share his enthusiasm for cars as he hunts down iconic motors and uses his expertise to give viewers first-class tips on how to transform them. With the help of Elvis, the pair will reveal their ambitious plans to restore a range of vehicles for a tidy profit, all while delving into the compelling design and manufacturing stories of each car.\"\n\nHonestly, the California vibe was never one that this New England native felt was a good fit for Wheeler Dealers. Sure, there is a great old-school culture of modification and hot-rodding in the state, but no place is trying harder to kill the very cars that Wheeler Dealers is saving than California.\n\nSimon Downing, SVP, Head of Factual and Sport, Discovery UK said: “Bringing Wheeler Dealers back to the UK is an exciting moment for us. We’d like to thank Ant for doing a truly amazing job, he will always remain a member of the Wheeler Dealers family and will be making some special appearances in future episodes. A warm welcome to Marc ‘Elvis’ Priestley who has already proved a hit among fans in the spin-off Dream Car.”\n\nYou can check out the next season of the show on MOTORTREND on demand, or via your TV content provider.
