        "text": "On Monday, Ant Anstead took to Instagram to make a big announcement. After three seasons, the charming mechanic would be leaving the cast of Wheelers Dealers.\n\nIn his post, Anstead explained that the show would be heading back to the United Kingdom for season 17. Unfortunately, he would not be going with it, but is \"proudly\" handing the spanners over to former Formula One mechanic Marc \"Elvis\" Priestley, who will take his place in the upcoming season. While the thought of watching Wheeler Dealers sans Anstead is unheard of, he added that he's staying \"home\" in California because he currently has three new shows in the works.\n\nFollowing his Instagram announcement, Anstead chatted on Zoom with his Wheeler Dealers co-star, Mike Brewer, as well as his replacement Preistley, about the show's future.\n\n\"For me, I’m sad because you and I have got an amazing bromance,\" Brewer said to Anstead. \"People are gonna say 'Brewer can’t hold onto these mechanics' and all this nonsense.\"\n\nAnt jokingly responded to now ex co-host. \"People say that about me and my wives,\" referencing his recent divorce from Christina Anstead, as well as his first divorce.\n\nThe show, which started in the U.K., switched gears in 2014, when it decided to film in California. Originally from Plymouth, England, Anstead was cast in the series in 2017. He packed up his entire life and jetted off to Southern California, unsure of how long the show would film in the States.\n\n➡ Love knowing what your favorite reality stars are up to? Same. Let's keep up with them together.\n\nIt was during his time there that Anstead met Christina. Back in the U.K., he had been married to a woman by the name of Louise Herbert for 12 years. He currently shares daughter Amelie, 17, and son Archie, 14, with her. Herbet and their two kids still live in the U.K.\n\nAnt joined the show in its 14th season. The show is halfway through airing its 16th season, which is the last season featuring Ant and Brewer together. Brewer does note, however, that Anstead will still be \"popping in\" during future seasons of Wheeler Dealers.\n\n\"Now that some years have passed, I’ve really settled in, but I really have established my life here. My world is here,\" he said to Priestley and Brewer. \"I have a family, I have a baby, as you know.\" As a refresher, Anstead currently shares one-year-old Hudson London with Christina.\n\nAnstead also made light of the three new shows he's been working on during the Zoom call, but added that he can't reveal too many details just yet. \"I’ve already started on them, but I can’t tell you what they are yet, because you know how TV works,\" he quipped."
