        "text": "Wheeler Dealers’ Mike Brewer will host the inaugural ‘Classics and Coffee’ event at Comet Classics’ Hampshire showroom on Sunday, 24 May, where he will be reunited with two vehicles from the latest series – the Ford F1 truck and the MGA.\n\nMike will be at the showroom and global distribution centre of Comet Classics, the classic motorcycle specialist, to hand over the two stunning restorations to owners Martin Webb and Ray Waller.\n\nMartin bought the 1950s Ford F1 pick-up, that Mike bought from a US collector in the second episode of the series currently being shown on the Discovery Channel, to use to transport their motorcycles to various events during show season.\n\nMartin said, ‘We had been looking for a vehicle but wanted something in keeping with the period of the motorbikes we specialise in. When we saw the F1, we knew that was exactly what we were looking for.’\n\nThe truck will also be joined at the company’s Emsworth base by the MGA that appeared in episode three – that had just been finished when Martin was telling Ray about the vehicles Mike and his mechanic Edd China were working on.\n\nAn MG fan, Ray was intrigued when he heard the team was working on restoring an MGA and decided that while the F1 would be for business, this great British sportscar would be for pleasure.\n\nWheeler Dealer and classic car fans can join Martin and Ray at Comet Classics, bringing along their own classic cars or motorcycles for an informal open day, starting at 10am, where they can meet Mike and see the vehicles as well as meeting like-minded enthusiasts.\n\n‘Classics and Coffee’ will take place at Comet Classics, Windsor House, Clovelly Road, Southbourne, Esmworth, PO10 8PF, starting at 10am."
