        "text": "A TV star has been left \"heartbroken\" as his iconic car is stolen from a hotel car park while filming the show. Wheeler Dealers presenter Mike Brewer has revealed a 'special car' was nicked while filming the show.\n\nThe TV show, aired on the Discovery channel, sees classic cars being restored and sold for profit. Mike was staying at the Premier Inn, Pontefract, West Yorkshire, ahead of a car show in Sherburn in Elmet.\n\n\"We were hoping to celebrate two milestones in fact on this episode of Wheeler Dealers,\" he said. \"One being that we've now came up to our 20th year of Wheeler Dealers and we are so excited to be celebrating 20 years we thought we'd do a special build of a very special car.\"\n\nREAD MORE Coronation Street's Georgia May Foote shares medical diagnosis after 'struggling'\n\nHe told fans: \"Many of you will know that, they are ending it next year and it's a crying shame, it's such an iconic car so we thought we would build a very special version of that car.\"\n\nA fan replied saying: \"Looks amazing!!! Hope you get it back!!! Would love a drive of that, takes me back, sort of car my mates would have as a first car when I was a young teen.\" A second shared: \"Need to appeal for dash cam footage, trailer most likely would’ve been followed. Add all the footage together and the same vehicle will pop up.\"\n\n\"Hope you get it back Mike, as otherwise it’s going to get stripped and no one gets to enjoy it,\" said another. Another typred: \"Nearly came today with our own XR2 but timing wasn't right for me. Fiesta groups are pretty tight knit and thats a distinctive car. It wont get far hopefully.\"\n\n\"I believe a news article has stated that there is CCTV of a white Mercedes Sprinter towing the trailer away. Is this correct?\" Macchina said. Croydon said: \"Mike, So sorry that this has happened, I do hope that you get this back and by the looks of things its defiantly become the \"Hottest Car in the UK\" right now thanks to all the media and social media coverage. Please keep doing what you do!!\""
