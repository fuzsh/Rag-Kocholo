Mellon Foundation Award\n\n(EDWARDSVILLE, Ill.) SIUE Associate Dean Carl Springer, from the College of Arts and Sciences, said it will take him at least five and possibly as many as 10 years to track down translations and commentaries of the fifth-century Christian Latin author Sedulius.\n\nSpringer is the recipient of an Andrew W. Mellon Foundation Award, which has been granted to the prestigious Catalogus Translationum Et Commentariorum project. The project published its first volume in 1958.\n\nThe associate dean for student development and general education, and a professor of classics at the University, Springer is perusing these works to gain more knowledge about the reception of Sedulius, an author whose numerous Latin hymns, poems and literary works were steeped in the Roman Catholic faith. Springer already has completed several books on Sedulius.\n\n\"What I'm doing is studying the commentaries and any translations there were of this author from the very earliest manuscripts we have through the 16th century,\" Springer said. \"I'm really excited to be part of this because it asks pre-eminent scholars in the field, throughout the world, to take responsibility for one author and find out all the different translations and commentaries that were produced for the works of that classical author in the medieval and renaissance periods.\"\n\nMellon Foundation awards are making it possible for scholars to catalogue translations and commentaries on the works of hundreds of ancient authors, Springer said.\n\nSpringer has spent many years of his life studying, as a recipient of the Alexander Von Humboldt award in Germany, and as a Fulbright scholar in Belgium. With his family in tow, he did research in libraries throughout France, Italy, England, Switzerland, Belgium, Austria, Spain, and Germany.\n\nSome of his fondest memories during his years of research abroad include living in a cottage built in 1603, eating silent meals with Belgian monks, and working closely with manuscripts over a thousand years old.\n\nHis next great adventure will take place this summer at the Newberry Library in Chicago and at the Pontifical Institute in Toronto, Canada, Springer said, where he plans to study translations and commentaries in early printed editions. In addition to travel, the award will help pay for ordering microfilms of the work.\n\nOne of the components to the research initiative that thrills Springer is, \"you're actually discovering knowledge,\" he said. \"Some of our earliest examples of the English language are found in the glosses (interlinear and marginal notations) from Sedulius' works, as well as old high-German glosses, an earlier form of the German we know today.\"\n\nHe said additionally the opportunity to share his scholarly passion with advanced students who have helped him with his research is one of the major reasons for his excitement about receiving the funding.\n\nBack to top\n\n12/19/06\n\nSIUE Assistant Professor Using Research To Target Alzheimer's\n\n(EDWARDSVILLE, Ill.) Ken Witt, assistant professor of pharmaceutical sciences at the Southern Illinois University Edwardsville School of Pharmacy, recently received a $100,000 grant from the Alzheimer's Drug Discovery Foundation to investigate potential treatments for the illness, as well as ways to hinder its progression.\n\nA chronic, progressive, and ultimately fatal brain disease that causes irreversible loss of mental function, the U.S. National Institutes of Health National Institute on Aging reports those diagnosed with the disease usually are over the age of 60.\n\nThe likelihood of developing the illness increases with age, the institute purports, with an estimated 50 percent of those 85 years and older living with the disease. \"As the U.S. population is living longer, we will continue to see a rise in this devastating disease, to which there is no cure or treatments to halt disease progression,\" Witt said.\n\nWitt said he will focus on drugs designed to break down brain plaques that form with Alzheimer's disease progression. \"This approach has the potential to enhance a sufferer's cognitive abilities and reduce or even prevent the disease's development,\" Witt said.\n\nBack to top\n\n12/19/06\n\nBoeing Co.

The students who were invited this year were from Edwardsville High School and the SIUE East St. Louis Charter School.\n\nFollowing a luncheon, legislators participated in a roundtable discussion with the high school students and SIUE Student Senators and leadership. The discussion topic was \"Leadership-Leading by Example.\" The event concluded with recognition of each legislator in attendance.\n\nShown in photo from left are: Illinois Rep.

Southern Illinois University Edwardsville and MackeyMitchell Associates, a St. Lous-based architectural firm, are among eight finalists for a nationwide design competition exploring the future of university housing.\n\nThe competition, sponsored by the Association of College and University Housing Officers-International (ACUHO-I) and the 21st Century Project, chose the finalists from 46 entries. The next stage for the finalists will be a presentation before nine jury members at the Wyndham Hotel and Resort in Phoenix, Ariz., on Jan. 26. The jury will consist of one university chief financial officer, one university chief academic officer, one university student affairs officer, one university chief housing officer, one student, two architects, and two industry design professionals.The winning entry will be awarded $25,000.\n\nSIUE's entry involved a team of students and housing officials from the University who joined forces with architects MackeyMitchell Associates to create a diverse design group. \"We believe this collaboration will set us apart because all of the other finalists are solely architectural firms,\" said Michael Schultz, director of University Housing for SIUE. \"We've supplied input from students, operations, residence life and administration to MackeyMitchell for what we think will be a more comprehensive entry,\" Schultz said.\n\n\"We wanted to include sustainability,\" he said, \"while incorporating what is known as 'the new urbanism' into the design and giving the design the flexibility to anticipate future technology. We think it's very exciting.\"\n\nNarbeth Emmanuel, vice chancellor for Student Affairs, said he believes the SIUE entry will be very competitive \"because of the nature of the team\" which includes many of the leadership aspects of SIUE residential life. \"It is, indeed, most impressive that SIUE has qualified for the final round which really reflects on the leadership and the quality of our staff in University Housing, as well as the expertise of MackeyMithcell,\" Emmanuel said. \"The team's commitment to excellence, forward thinking and creativity is also reflected in our housing program at SIUE.\"\n\nThe 21st Century Project is a multi-phased initiative leading to the construction of a new, state-of-the-art residential facility for colleges and universities. In addition to creating one or more prototype residential facilities on several campuses, the project will assist colleges and universities in designing new residential facilities that reflect the ever changing roles that residences play in the collegiate experience.\n\n\"The demographics of the jury (to choose a winner) was selected based on the idea of who we felt should be at the discussion table when a college or university is considering the construction of new housing,\" said Coakley. \"Each of these individuals will bring their own experiences and viewpoints as they try to determine which design is the winner.\"\n\nTo further the educational mission of the 21st Century Project, the jury presentations will be open to the public.\n\nOther finalists included are (in alpha order): American Campus Communities & WDG Architecture Team (Austin, Texas). Angelini and Associates Architects (Ann Arbor, Mich.), Bergmeyer Associates Inc. (Boston), CSO Schenkel Shultz (Indianapolis), Levi Architects (Boston), Marks, Thomas Architects (Baltimore), and RATIO Architects Inc. (Indianapolis).\n\nDesigners, students, architects, and college housing professionals from around the world submitted design proposals for an individual student living unit. Each contestant was challenged to incorporate concepts such as flexibility, sustainability, student development, security, and technology as they created a vision for residence hall rooms and suites 25 years into the future.\n\n\"There are some truly innovative ideas represented in these designs,\" said Michael Coakley, coordinator of the 21st Century Project. \"It's exciting to see these proposals and think that we're actually seeing the future of college housing being created.\"\n\nFuture competitions will build upon the winning entry from January's event. Designers will create ways to cluster the room into halls or pods, and those clusters will then be grouped into a building. \"The ultimate goal of this project has always been the actual construction of a new, prototype residence hall,\" said Coakley.\n\nFor more information about the competition and the 21st Century Project, visit the Web site at www.21stCenturyProject.com or contact ACUHO-I at 614.292.0099.

Creating this panel was a promise made by the president in response to incidents occurring at numerous university campuses, including both Carbondale and Edwardsville.\n\nIn addition to recommending new policies to cover administrative reports, marketing publications and other boilerplate language, Poshard will ask the panel to consider other issues including the impact of the Internet and how much weight should be given to an author's intent. Changes in SIU Board of Trustees policies and campus policies will likely result from the panel's work.\n\nThe panel will have access to all University policies on academic dishonesty as well as recent scholarship on the topic of plagiarism. The panel also will be asked to examine the discussion that is currently being held on college campuses nationwide on the practices of acknowledgement and attribution as they apply to institutional versus scholarly authorship.\n\nPanel members are:\n\nEdwardsville\n\nLynn Bartels, School of Education\n\nMike Crider, School of Pharmacy\n\nDavid Duvernell, College of Arts and Sciences\n\nJane Gillespie, School of Dental Medicine\n\nSteve Hansen, Graduate Studies and Research\n\nCarbondale\n\nLain Adkins, SIU Press, Chair\n\nLiz DiLalla, School of Medicine\n\nGerald Nelms, College of Liberal Arts\n\nPrudence Rice, Vice Chancellor for Research\n\nDavid Worrells, College of Applied Sciences and Arts\n\nBack to top\n\n12/15/06\n\nSIU president announces search committee for Carbondale campus chancellor\n\n(CARBONDALE, IL) Susan M. Ford, chair of the Department of Anthropology, will head the 16-member committee that will conduct a nationwide search for the next chancellor of the Carbondale campus. The remaining members of the committee are:\n\nJay Brooks, Civil Service Council\n\nBrad Cole, community representative\n\nProfessor Morteza Daneshdoost, Faculty Association\n\nLarry DeJarnett, SIU Foundation\n\nProfessor James Duggan, School of Law\n\nCharlotte Gibson, Administrative and Professional Staff Council\n\nCheri Hunter, Alumni Association\n\nAssociate Professor Wesley McNeese, School of Medicine\n\nProfessor Gary Minish, Deans Council\n\nProfessor Salah-Eldin Mohammed, Mathematics\n\nJon Pressley, Graduate and Professional Student Council\n\nAssociate Professor Linda McCabe Smith, Rehabilitation Institute\n\nProfessor Margaret \"Peggy\" Stockdale, Psychology\n\nJasmin Thurston, Undergraduate Student Government\n\nAssociate Professor David Worrells, Aviation Management and Flight\n\nThe committee, which will hold its first meeting before the holiday break, will be assisted in the process by a search firm. The committee anticipates reviewing applications in February and March 2007, interviewing semifinalists at an off-campus location in late March, and selecting a short list of finalists to visit the Carbondale campus in April. The committee will provide its evaluation of the finalists to President Glenn Poshard, who will make the final selection. The committee hopes to complete the entire process by the end of the spring semester.\n\nBack to top\n\n12/13/06\n\nSIUE Nursing Curriculum Change Shifts Focus To Patient, Not Illness\n\n(EDWARDSVILLE, Ill.) A student of Southern Illinois University Edwardsville's School of Nursing stands beside a man lying on a stretcher with a knee injury.\n\nThe type of pain medication she administers to this patient depends largely on what other medications he is taking, along with various other factors.\n\nThe 65-year-old man is an insulin-dependent diabetic and has a 40-year history of heavy smoking. He is noticeably wheezing and coughing, and his feet are somewhat swollen.\n\nThese factors all can impact pace and degree of recovery and the nurse knows this. While the patient in this scenario is a mannequin, or a human-simulator, and the stretcher is located in one of several examination and treatment rooms in SIUE's Simulated Learning Center for Health Sciences, the nursing student is able to gain exposure to situations like this one long before she encounters a real patient in the hospital with these problems.\n\nThanks to revisions to the undergraduate nursing curriculum in spring 2006, all student nurses will exercise critical thinking skills in similar situations prior to graduation, and will be more likely pass the National Licensing Exam (NCLEX), said Mary Mulcahy, assistant dean for undergraduate programs. It is mandatory that graduates pass the NCLEX in order to practice as registered nurses.\n\nThe school's state-of-the-art learning center is home to human-simulators that exist in a hospital-like setting. These simulators react to \"medications\" and \"treatments\" as a patient would in a hospital.\n\nClinical courses are designed to focus on specific age and special health-needs groups. Mulcahy said groups include women, child-bearing families, adolescents, young adults, middle-aged adults, older adults and groups with special health needs, such as those diagnosed with mental illnesses.\n\nWhile the implementation of the revised curriculum program last spring presented challenges, a year later, Mulcahy said the Gordon's model has nationally become a more popular methodology for instructing student nurses.\n\n\"It's a much more holistic approach to caring for people versus the systems model,\" she said. \"The focus in the nursing classes is to really look at the person as a whole instead of focusing on a disorder.\"\n\n\"The undergraduate curriculum revision has been sweeping,\" Maurer said. \"Aside from what the students are learning, a key component of the revision is how they are learning.\n\n\"In the SIUE School of Nursing program the students and teacher are collaborators in the classroom. The students collaborate with the teacher who guides and facilitates their learning. The approach pushes the students to analyze and synthesize learning. This will make for an excellent nurse.\"\n\nBack to top\n\n12/13/06\n\nSIUE School of Nursing Provides Students Mentoring\n\n(EDWARDSVILLE, Ill.) Nearing the end of a successful first semester, the Southern Illinois University Edwardsville School of Nursing's mentor program offers inspiration and motivation for future nurses, and helps faculty feel connected to the student base.\n\n\"Mentors guide students down many different pathways of nursing, opening doors that, otherwise, may not have been opened,\" said James Gauen, a senior nursing major from Pontoon Beach. \"Through students, educators gain valuable insight on their teaching methods; and with this knowledge, can adapt their teaching style to enhance student learning.\n\n\"Faculty mentors provide great learning potential for both the educators and students. The SIUE School of Nursing is on the leading-edge of this interactive teaching method. Mentoring provides a student-teacher relationship that benefits both the student and the teacher.\"\n\nFaculty members who act as mentors work closely with students within the program to ensure that engaging, enriching programs and activities are available through the school. The mentors also act as professional advisors, grooming students to enter the professional world with a greater sense of confidence and ability, according to School of Nursing Dean Marcia Maurer. Maurer acts as Gauen's mentor.\n\nThe dean added that faculty mentors lend students support in dealing with nursing school pressures, link them to valuable academic and professional resources, and help them prepare professional portfolios.\n\nSarah Jordan, 25, and her husband, both of Springfield, lost a daughter to Sudden Infant Death Syndrome (SIDS) two years ago. That loss, and the resulting response from health care professionals, sparked Jordan's interest in nursing.\n\nNow a sophomore in the SIUE School of Nursing, set to graduate in spring 2009, Jordan recalls: \"Out of all the emergency personnel we met with when our daughter died, the nurses were the most helpful,\" she said. \"It felt like they really wanted to help us. They were tremendous.\"\n\nThat experience convinced Jordan to pursue a career in nursing. She said the guidance she has received from her mentor, faculty-member Cathy Koetting, an instructor with the school, has helped Jordan acclimate to the nursing program's challenging environment.\n\n\"Just being able to talk to someone who has knowledge has been so helpful,\" Jordan said. \"The mentor, and really the faculty are always there and they always have so much support to offer.\n\n\"Having a mentor makes you feel like you're more a part of the program. You feel like the school really wants you here and people want you to succeed.\"\n\nThe program was initiated to strengthen relationships between students and faculty members, said Stephen Held, the School of Nursing's director of admissions.\n\nHeld acts as a faculty resource, helping mentors become more effective by recommending activities and opportunities for their students.\n\nFor more information about the mentoring program, call the School of Nursing, (618) 650-3956.\n\nBack to top\n\n12/7/06\n\nMarketing Faculty Member Visits Franchising Academy\n\n(EDWARDSVILLE, Ill.) The International Franchising Academy, part of Beijing Normal University in Zhuhai, China, has some 800 students studying franchising under the tutelage of 30 faculty in a four-year degree program.\n\nMarko Grünhagen, an assistant professor of Marketing at Southern Illinois University Edwardsville, has been named a visiting professor at the academy. \"I was one of only 10 academics from around the globe with research expertise in franchising to attend the four-day China Franchise International Summit recently at Zhuhai,\" Grünhagen said.\n\n\"I also met the Deputy Head of the Chinese Ministry of Commerce and took part in a ribbon-cutting of China Franchise City in Guangzhou.\"\n\nGrünhagen said China Franchise City is a building complex with six floors dedicated as a \"test mall\" in which retail franchising concepts may be tested on consumers. The remainder of the building is dedicated to office suites for foreign franchise companies planning to expand into the Chinese market.\n\nThe marketing professor, whose research interest is franchise marketing and who is associate editor of the Journal of Small Business Management, pointed out that nearly half of all goods and services sold in the United States is through franchise operations. \"It's a trillion dollar industry,\" he said.\n\nGrünhagen presented a paper on how franchising affects emerging economies. \"Mainland China has had McDonald's and Kentucky Fried Chicken restaurants for many years,\" Grünhagen said. \"Even though the majority of franchising throughout the world has taken place outside China, the Chinese also have been developing their own franchise food businesses.\n\n\"I predict that over the next five to 10 years, Chinese franchise companies will become major players in other countries,\" Grünhagen said.\n\nGrünhagen explained that the conference he attended in China was a meeting of franchisees, franchisors, franchise attorneys, consultants and scholars from around the world.\n\nIt was a chance for the Chinese to learn more about the franchise phenomenon from other perspectives and to show off what they have accomplished.\n\n\"The students from the Franchise Academy were very enthusiastic, soaking up information from the conference like sponges,\" Grünhagen said. \"Every free moment, they were asking us questions about life and business in the United States,\" he said.\n\nDuring the conference, Grünhagen pointed out, place settings at the table always included a cup of hot tea and bottled water. Grünhagen said this was symbolic to him of the co-existence of traditions and modernity in China. \"This has not been an easy road for China, but it's incredible to me to see how quickly the economy has grown there compared with other economies in the world.\"\n\nPhoto 1\n\nMarko Grunhagen is shown here receiving a letter from Miao Zhongzheng, president of Beijing Normal University at Zhuhai, appointing him visiting professor\n\nBack to top\n\n12/7/06\n\nStudents In Holiday Spirit With Operation Holiday Humanity\n\n(EDWARDSVILLE, Ill.) The holidays are upon us and like several student organizations at Southern Illinois University Edwardsville, members of the Academy of Student Pharmacists (ASP) have become swept up in the spirit of giving, so much so they had to expand their activities.\n\nIt all started when the group-the SIUE School of Pharmacy chapter of the American Pharmacists Association ASP-decided to help two needy families through the Glen-Ed Food Pantry by sponsoring a trivia night. \"The idea was to use proceeds from the event to help the needy,\" said Timothy McPherson, associate professor of Pharmaceutical Sciences for the School and co-advisor of the local ASP chapter.\n\n\"The students adopted two local families through the Glen-Ed Pantry and proceeds from the trivia night fundraiser went to them,\" McPherson said. \"But the students also asked for donations from parents of the students and it took off from there.\"\n\nThat effort blossomed into something the ASP students have named Operation Holiday Humanity. McPherson explained that additional donations were used to purchase personal items that fit in shoeboxes to help homeless families who visit the Holy Angels Shelter in East St. Louis.\n\n\"Now, through Operation Holiday Humanity, fund-raising activities have gone beyond anyone's expectations, so chapter members decided to expand their efforts to help the homeless through the East St. Louis shelter,\" he explained.\n\nItems purchased for the shoeboxes have included gloves, hats, baby wipes, and other personal items, said Jessica Kerr, assistant professor of Pharmacy Practice at the School and co-advisor to the ASP chapter. \"One student's father is a dentist and he donated toothbrushes, dental floss and toothpaste,\" Kerr said. \"Students who are working while attending classes also have been soliciting their employers with impressive results.\n\n\"The students originally thought they would put items in stockings, but then they decided that the shoeboxes may be more helpful to homeless families.\"\n\nAs a first-year student last year, Maggie Rodeffer of La Harpe was in charge of Christmas donations for the class of 2009. \"We collected nonperishable food items for the Glen-Ed Food Pantry as well as new toys for the Toys for Tots campaign,\" she explained.\n\n\"Based on the success of that drive, I was asked to chair the committee for the Operation Holiday Humanity campaign.\n\n\"We are really encouraging students, faculty, and staff to make small monetary donations that are within reach for a college student, so we can provide items to people who are less fortunate than us,\" Rodeffer said. \"Just a small donation can make a really big impact on a person's life, just knowing that someone cares about them.\n\n\"I believe that everyone wants to be able to give something to others who are in need, especially during the holiday season.\"\n\nPhoto 1\n\nOfficers of the SIUE School of Pharmacy chapter of the American Pharmacists Association (APA) recently met with the president of the national APA, Dan Zlott, second from left.

Richard Dremuk, retired assistant vice chancellor for Enrollment Management, and his wife, Patricia, have established an endowment to fund a scholarship for SIUE international students to support academic excellence and to foster leadership skills.\n\nThe Richard and Patricia Dremuk Scholarship/Leadership Fund will be administered through the Center for International Programs (CIP). Scholarships will be awarded through a committee chosen by the director of CIP and approved by the Vice Chancellor for Student Affairs.\n\nThe Dremuks were honored recently at SIUE's International Night, where a group of students presented the couple with a framed aerial photo of campus, also containing photo insets of SIUE international students and autographs with sentiments of gratitude in various foreign languages.\n\nRupak Thapaliya, president of the Nepalese Student Association at the University, aid the Dremuks are to be commended for their dedication to international students. \"The Dremuk Fund has further encouraged international students to get involved in the community and bring about diversity on campus,\" Thapaliya said.\n\n\"On behalf of the international students, I would like to sincerely thank the family in helping the students by making this contribution. This gesture encourages all international students at SIUE.\"\n\nGifty Dankyi, a graduate student from Ghana, Africa, said the Dremuk scholarship is among the most thoughtful support initiatives for International Students. \"I am very grateful to the Dremuks for this resource,\" Dankyi said. \"Their gesture makes otherwise difficult situations manageable. They are key contributors to the success of the international program at SIUE.\"\n\nDremuk said he and his wife have been helping international students in one way or another for some four decades. \"I met my wife at NYU (New York University), where she worked with international students,\" Dremuk explained. \"We've continued to be involved with helping international students for the past 40 years.\n\n\"At SIUE, Patricia and I helped develop the International Student Services office, but we've wanted to do something more and this scholarship fund helps us do that.\"\n\nRon Schaefer, director of International Programs for the University, said the Dremuk Fund will recognize significant contributions by SIUE international students to leadership and scholarship on campus. \"Scholarship in its various manifestations is the central focus for our international students,\" Schaefer said.\n\n\"They have come here to broaden their education and to contribute to the intellectual rigor of our classrooms and laboratories. International students share their cultures and societies with the SIUE community in various ways, such as the International Student Council, International Night, International Week, Africa Night and others,\" Schaefer said.\n\n\"The success of these events depends on the international students themselves. They receive guidance from SIUE staff, but it is the students who design and implement these events. They contribute to various other programs across campus as well.\n\n\"The Dremuk Fund will recognize outstanding instances of leadership displayed by SIUE international students with regard to campus life.\"\n\nNarbeth Emmanuel, SIUE's vice chancellor for Student Affairs, said the Dremuk Fund honors those international students for their contributions to the University's commitment to diversity and campus life.\n\n\"The Dremuks have been wonderful and true friends of SIUE and especially to our international community,\" Emmanuel said. \"This gift is an important contribution to what this University stands for.\"\n\nPhoto 1\n\nDick and Patricia Dremuk, left of center, are shown here accepting a framed photo montage from international students recently at SIUE International Night.

Bowen Archives at Lovejoy Library, and Amanda Bahr-Evola, a senior library specialist in the Archives, have prepared an illustrated history of the celebrated performing arts festival that began as a partnership between SIUE and the Saint Louis Symphony Orchestra.\n\nThrough 12 summers-between 1969 and 1980-the MRF presented 353 events, showcasing performers in a variety of musical genres including classical, chamber, vocal, ragtime, blues, folk, bluegrass, barbershop harmony, country and rock, as well as dance and theater.\n\nThe Mississippi River Festival (Arcadia, 2006) contains more than 200 photographs plus text describing the site (including the iconic MRF tent), the personalities associated with the festival (such as tentmaster Skip Manley), and the remarkable performers and audiences.\n\nA volume in the Images of America series from Arcadia Publishing, The Mississippi River Festival is available for $19.99 at local bookstores, including the SIUE University Bookstore. All royalties from sales of the book go directly to the Friends of Lovejoy Library, a support organization for the SIUE library.\n\nBook signing receptions featuring the authors have been scheduled for Piece of Mind Books, 1530 Troy Road, Edwardsville (656-7277), at 1 p.m. Saturday, Dec. 9, and also at the SIUE Bookstore in the Morris Center (650-2132), from 4-5:30 p.m. Monday, Dec. 11.\n\nThe book is the first of several projects and activities being prepared to honor SIUE's upcoming 50th Anniversary Celebration (1957-2007).\n\nBack to top\n\n11/27/06\n\nVirtuoso Violinist Ivers To Present Christmas Show Dec. 9 At SIUE\n\n(EDWARDSVILLE, Ill.)

It may have been her mathematical mind mingled with her passion for music that brought Ivers to seek parallels in traditional music styles that contributed to the signature sound in much of her recordings since the 1980s.\n\nIn 1999, Ivers established a touring production to present the music that now encompasses Eileen Ivers & Immigrant Soul, a blend of African and Latin percussions along with Irish instrumentalists and soulful vocals.

These activities also helped SIUE students and exchange students form vital relationships.\n\nAfter these 20 students leave in mid-December, SIUE will welcome 16 new exchange students from four partner schools. As part of the exchange program, SIUE will in turn send nine of its students to study abroad at partner schools in Germany, France, England and the Netherlands.\n\nIn addition to playing host to exchange students, the Office of International Programs continues to strengthen its ties with local businesses by sponsoring speakers on campus related to the international business arena.\n\nAccording to Cyndi Peterson, assistant director of OIP for the School of Business, \"The relationships that are formed through these speaking engagements improve our students' employment prospects, as networking is essential in today's job market. Guest speakers also increase students' appreciation for international business, as they can see how concepts they are learning in class are actually implemented.\"\n\nOIP, in partnership with the School's International Business Association, has been host to several speakers this semester, including David Schweppe, director of Business Development, Precision Engagement International at the Boeing Company. Schweppe spoke about Boeing's international business strategy, highlighting considerations the company strategically uses to evaluate potential markets and select which markets to enter.\n\nSince its inception in 1990, one of OIP's main goals has been to create and develop student awareness of global issues, especially those affecting international business, and maintaining partnerships with eight institutions abroad and local firms that conduct business internationally.\n\nBack to top\n\n11/17/06\n\nNursing Partnership Helps Professionals Prepare For Trauma Cases\n\n(EDWARDSVILLE, Ill.) Southern Illinois University Edwardsville School of Nursing students can practice life-saving skills before they are faced with a life or death situation in the hospital. Now health care professionals in the field have the same opportunity.\n\nThe School's Simulated Learning Center for Health Sciences (SLCHS), which was the first of its kind in the Midwest, offers the perfect setting for students and trained professionals to make critical, split-second decisions in a practice environment. The SLCHS also trains them to face real-world scenarios with conviction and confidence.\n\nProfessionals can handle trauma situations before they happen in the real world, thanks to the University's state-of-the-art mannequins that breathe, blink, have pulses and react appropriately to medication according to dosage administered.\n\nPractice sessions allow nurses and other providers the opportunity to think about the best way to address a patient's needs in a given situation before the real situation presents itself.\n\nMaria Wolf, a lecturer in the School of Nursing and a lab assistant, arranges a variety of computer-generated trauma scenarios for professionals to tackle. \"She was so energetic and helpful,\" said Candace Jennings, chief nurse officer for St. John's Hospital in Springfield.\n\nSt. John's is one of two Springfield hospitals that rotates Level I trauma cases as mandated by the State of Illinois. St. John's had not been required to take trauma cases for some time before the state's mandate, and members of its staff decided training in the SLCHS would help strengthen and sharpen their skills.\n\nFor three months this past spring and summer, nurses and respiratory therapists piled into a van and traveled from Springfield to Edwardsville to take advantage of the training opportunity, which is unlike any other in the state. When the staff was faced in October with a real-life trauma case, they were able to incorporate what they had learned during the training and quickly respond and deliver care.\n\nIt was the first trauma case the staff members had faced in 15 months, Jennings said, adding the time spent in the training lab helped prepare the employee to take charge. She said the physicians on staff at St. John's noticed a marked difference in the way health care providers, who took part in the training, handled the case from previously handled trauma cases.\n\n\"We were delighted to work with the nurses of St. John's Hospital in Springfield in our Simulated Learning Center for Health Sciences,\" said Marcia Maurer, SIUE's School of Nursing dean. \"It demonstrated that our resources serve and foster excellence not only in students, but also in nursing professionals beyond our walls.\"\n\nBack to top\n\n11/16/06\n\nJimmy Dean, Jimmy Dean To Be Staged At SIUE Nov. 29-Dec. 3\n\n(EDWARDSVILLE, Ill.)

Ed Graczyk's award-winning drama will be staged at Southern Illinois University Edwardsville from Thursday-Sunday, Nov. 29-Dec. 3.\n\nThe play takes place in West Texas in 1975, near the small town of Marfa, where the blockbuster Hollywood tome Giant was filmed two decades earlier. The flick was James Dean's last film appearance before his death and the characters in Graczyk's play still bask in the excitement of Dean's visit even though nearly 20 years have passed.\n\nDuring a reunion of childhood friends, we find that their lives have gone very different ways and that reputations have become a bit tarnished through the years. They may have shared common values in 1955, but the only common thread is their collective memories of the American film idol Dean.\n\nEnjoying his directing debut at SIUE, Roger Speidel is better known to local audiences as a set designer, technical director and instructor in the Department of Theater and Dance. He also has been seen on stage in several musicals at the University and as the Baker in Stephen Sondheim's hit musical Into the Woods at Alton Little Theater last year.\n\nSpeidel also designed the set for Into the Woods, for which he won an Arts for Life Award in St. Louis in spring of this year.\n\nAlthough he's been involved in several productions at SIUE since arriving in 2002 and has directed at other venues, he has never had the chance to direct here. \"I'm very busy with this production because I'm directing and also mentoring students who are serving as set designer and technical director,\" Speidel said. \"It's a bit hectic, but I'm enjoying it.\"\n\nSpeidel also pointed out that the cast is very effective in the roles of the women of the \"Disciples of James Dean,\" who have returned to their hometown for the 20th anniversary of Dean's death in a car crash. \"We have a great mix of veteran student actors and new actors who have never been in a drama,\" he said. \"They're doing a great job and I'm pleased with their progress.\n\n\"I believe audiences will enjoy this show because these characters are people with whom we can identify,\" Speidel said. \"Many of us know people with whom we have strained relationships and we can easily identify with the concept of seeing old friends who turn out different from what they were 20 years earlier. \"It's like what Juanita says in the play: 'Believin's so funny, ain't it? When what you believe in doesn't even know you exist.'\n\n\"This entire experience has been rewarding for me, the cast and the crew, and I hope the audience will feel the camaraderie from the stage.\"\n\nJimmy Dean, Jimmy Dean plays at 7:30 p.m. Wednesday through Saturday, Nov. 29-Dec. 2, and at 2 p.m. Sunday, Dec. 3, all at SIUE's James F.

Also, since last year, Saff has lead the BCA Marquee multi-site project to define technologies for the next generation commercial aircraft.\n\nBack to top\n\n11/16/06\n\nPREVIEW SIUE Drew Some 2,850 Visitors Over Two Days\n\n(EDWARDSVILLE, Ill.) PREVIEW SIUE, the annual open house at Southern Illinois University Edwardsville, attracted nearly 2,900 parents and students, said Karen Bollinger, assistant director of Admissions and Academic Marketing for the university and coordinator of the event.\n\n\"We are very happy with the attendance for both programs,\" Bollinger said. \"There's a lot of excitement at SIUE and more and more students want to see what it's all about.\n\n\"PREVIEW SIUE is a showcase opportunity for high school students and their families as well as students who are considering a transfer to SIUE from other institutions to see first hand what SIUE has to offer,\" she said.\n\n\"Choosing a college is a critical decision in a person's life. With so many higher education options, it's important for students to choose a college that is an ideal fit. We want students to compare SIUE with their individual higher education goals.\"\n\nBollinger said faculty and staff from virtually all academic departments and student services units were on hand Oct. 9 and Nov. 10 to talk with students and answer questions. \"At PREVIEW SIUE, our faculty and staff take an active role in talking with prospective students and introducing them to the academic opportunities available at SIUE.\n\n\"We like to get to know the students and their parents, while at the same time offering them the information they'll need to make sound decisions about a college choice.\n\n\"The feedback we received from our prospective student visitors and families was very positive. When asked 'what impressed you most about SIUE,' students and parents most frequently noted: 'friendly and helpful environment' followed by 'beautiful campus.'\n\n\"PREVIEW SIUE is an excellent chance to visit campus and learn about what we have to offer; however, it's not the only opportunity. The Schools of Engineering, Business, Pharmacy and the College of Arts and Sciences are planning open house programs in the spring. Also, students may schedule a campus visit by registering at the University Web site: www.siue.edu/prospectivestudents.\"\n\nBack to top\n\n11/16/06\n\nSIUE Student Competes On Millionaire; To Air Thanksgiving\n\n(EDWARDSVILLE, Ill.) Viewers will need to tune in to Who Wants To Be A Millionaire on Wednesday-Thursday, Nov. 22-23, to find out how thankful Southern Illinois University Edwardsville student Alyx Mark is this holiday season.\n\nWith the results of her national TV appearance under wraps until air time, the 18-year-old junior, majoring in political science, said she is \"satisfied\" with the outcome. She could not be any more specific than that because of a contractual agreement with the show's production company.\n\n\"It was an amazing experience,\" Mark said of the time she spent in New York City during the October taping of the College Week-themed shows. The pressure definitely was on, she said, as it was unclear at what point she would be called on stage to compete.\n\nIn the \"green room,\" the area where hopefuls wait their turn to appear on the show, she said the brownies, cookies, fresh fruit and other treats were inviting, \"But I couldn't eat anything. I was so nervous.\"\n\nLooking back on the week she spent in the Big Apple, \"The time was a blur,\" she said, noting the time her segment was taped flew by.\n\nThe very ambitious only child from Wood River graduated from Roxana Senior High School at the age of 17. She accepted a Chancellor's Scholarship to attend SIUE. \"You can't turn down a free education,\" she said. \"You just can't turn down an opportunity like this.\"\n\nHaving chosen SIUE, she said she is \"very happy\" she made the decision she did. While she was accepted to other universities, \"This really was the best fit.\" Now the teen is contemplating her next move in life.\n\n\"I'm not sure if I want to pursue graduate school or if I want to go to law school,\" she said, noting that first she plans to take a long, well-deserved vacation. \"I would love to spend a year living in an old house someplace in France or Italy, just writing and enjoying life.\"\n\nBut before she takes time to rest and relax, Mark plans to spend this summer in Africa as part of a study abroad program. She is very active in the Political Science Association on campus, and will be one of several students who will build a mock refugee village in SIUE's Stratton Quadrangle later this month in recognition of Genocide Awareness Week from Nov. 27-Dec. 1.\n\n\"So many people don't realize that 400,000 people have died in Darfur (in Western Sudan, Africa)\" Mark said. She and students from other majors across campus are part of the effort to educate other members of the campus community, as well as visitors during the week of activities.\n\nMark's mother, Dawn Means of Wood River, flew with her daughter to New York. Means is a junior high school teacher in the Bethalto School District. Mark's father, Michael Mark, is a safety coordinator for SM Wilson in St. Louis.\n\nNationally syndicated Who Wants To Be A Millionaire, hosted by Meredith Vieira, will feature several undergraduate students during College Week Nov. 20-24.

Southern Illinois University Edwardsville students will honor more than 400,000 victims of genocide from Darfur during Genocide Awareness Week, Nov. 27-Dec. 1.\n\nMembers of SIUE's Political Science Association will spend a week in a mock refugee camp on the berms of the Stratton Quadrangle on campus. The group is hoping to educate people about genocide-the act of killing a specific racial, ethnic, national or political group with the intent to eradicate it-and its role in war and global politics.\n\nThe week will be filled with speakers, films, a candlelight vigil and discussion of the position of religious leaders and their lack of involvement. \"The whole point of the week is to generate awareness,\" said Denise DeGarmo, an assistant professor of political science at the University. \"One of the focuses will be on Darfur.\"\n\nThe conflict is occurring in the Darfur region of western Sudan. A struggle exists between the Janjaweed, a military group consisting of people from local tribes, and non-Baggara people, who are members of a regional farming tribe.\n\nSince 2003 the Sudanese government has provided support to the Janjaweed against the non-Baggara people-the Fur, Zaghawa and Massaleit ethnic groups-yet has claimed it does not support the Janjaweed, DeGarmo said.\n\nShe acknowledges genocide has occurred in other nations in the past, but she is focusing on events in Darfur because \"Darfur is the first genocide that most of our students are aware of. We will examine the role of genocide and the use of genocide.\" DeGarmo said she is hoping the students will engage in discussion about what the current generation could do to obliterate such practices.\n\nOther activities throughout the week will include a showing of the film, Hotel Rwanda, at 6:30 p.m. Monday, Nov. 27, at the SIUE Religious Center; a presentation on the Sudan by Anthony Cheeseboro, chair and associate professor of SIUE's Department of Historical Studies, on campus at noon, Tuesday, Nov. 28; a panel discussion in response to genocide on campus (at a time yet to be determined) Thursday, Nov. 29; and a candlelight vigil Friday, Dec. 1, at a time yet to be determined.\n\nFor more information, call (618) 650-3375.\n\nBack to top\n\n11/13/06\n\nNovember Employee Of The Month\n\nCongratulations: Paula Manny, departmental information supervisor in the Office of Academic Counseling and Advising, is recipient of the November Employee Recognition Award.

Scott will receive the award at a Nov. 19 ceremony and reception at the Ritz-Carlton Hotel in Clayton.\n\nScott is among 100 teachers who are being recognized this year by Emerson as \"an example of outstanding teaching excellence.\" The Emerson recognition program is in its 17th year and has become a significant recognition among St. Louis area teachers. \"Emerson is proud to sponsor this program as a way of helping the St. Louis community express our collective admiration and gratitude for teaching our area's young people,\" said David Farr, chairman, CEO and president of St. Louis-based Emerson.\n\n\"We are recognizing the vital role outstanding teachers, such as Vickie Scott, play in the St. Louis community.\"\n\nBack to top\n\n11/10/06\n\nWalgreens Fulfills $30,000 Pledge To SIUE School Of Pharmacy\n\n(EDWARDSVILLE, Ill.) Walgreens Inc., the national retail pharmacy corporation, recently presented a $10,000 check to the Southern Illinois University Edwardsville School of Pharmacy in support of general activities at the School. The check is the third and final installment in Walgreen's pledge of $30,000 that was made in 2004.\n\nSurrounded by several Walgreens district managers and pharmacy supervisors, Dennis Hunt, pharmacy supervisor for Walgreens' St. Louis West District, handed the check to Pharmacy Dean Philip Medon. \"We greatly appreciate that one of the largest pharmacy chains in the country is committed to our educational efforts at the SIUE School of Pharmacy,\" Medon said.\n\n\"It's also significant to me because Dennis has been on our advisory board since the beginning, and has been an important resource in our program planning.\"\n\nHunt said the SIUE School of Pharmacy is extremely important to the pharmacy industry because the School will be graduating students who will fill a need in the current pharmacist shortage in the country. \"The shortage of pharmacists in the U.S. has greatly affected the St. Louis area, affected our business,\" Hunt said. \"We continue to open more stores in this region and we're feeling the shortage.\"\n\nThe need for pharmacists nationwide is expected to grow by 30 percent in the next eight years, while the need in Illinois also will grow by nearly 20 percent in the next six years. \"It's is critical that we ensure quality of training so that SIUE's pharmacy graduates are an asset to the industry,\" Hunt said. \"I believe that's exactly what Dean Medon and his faculty and staff are doing here at SIUE and Walgreens recognizes that importance.\"\n\nMedon said the Walgreens pledge has been a great asset in building a new School of Pharmacy at SIUE. \"This generous gift has allowed us to support faculty and student professional development that would not have been possible otherwise,\" he said.\n\nThe SIUE School of Pharmacy, which offers a professional program leading to a Doctor of Pharmacy, values excellence in teaching, pharmacy practice, research/scholarship and service. The program of study is based on current knowledge and technology from pharmacy and other disciplines, and is delivered through a variety of innovative teaching strategies.\n\nPhoto 1\n\nOn hand for the check presentation are SIUE School of Pharmacy Dean Philip Medon (third from right) and SIUE Provost Paul Ferguson (fifth from left).

Dana Hamann of Winthrop Harbor, a graduate student in psychology at Southern Illinois University Edwardsville, won a gold ribbon for a poster presentation, Abuse and the Effects on Eating Disorder Symptomatology and Body Image: Does Treatment for the Abuse Influence This Relationship, at the Sigma Xi Annual Meeting and Student Research Conference recently in Detroit.\n\nThe award was given for excellence of Hamann's poster presentation and the research it represented. The poster content mirrored the content of her master's thesis. Hamann was attending the conference as the delegate from the SIUE chapter of Sigma Xi.\n\nSigma Xi is an international, multidisciplinary research honor society whose programs and activities promotes the health of scientific enterprise and honors scientific achievement. The society endeavors to encourage support of original work across the spectrum of science and technology, and to promote an appreciation within society at large for the role research has played in human progress.\n\nAt the annual meeting, delegates from Sigma Xi chapters decide governance questions of the Society and attend various sessions about leadership, chapter management and major issues.\n\nIn addition, undergraduates of more than 100 institutions from around the world present research, attend career-focused workshops, meet graduate school recruiters and network with Sigma Xi members.\n\nBack to top\n\n11/9/06\n\nConstruction Of Parking Lot Approved By SIU Board Of Trustees\n\n(EDWARDSVILLE, Ill.) The Southern Illinois University Board of Trustees today approved construction of a 350-space parking lot on the north side of Circle Drive-across from the SIUE Vadalabene Center-at an estimated cost of $650,000.\n\nThe approval vote was taken today at the board's regular meeting on the Edwardsville campus. It was one of three measures on the board's agenda that affects SIUE.\n\nCost of the new lot will be funded from a change in the project description of the proceeds from the sale of 2006A bonds that were approved by the board in March. That change in project description also was approved at today's meeting. Debt service for the lot will be funded from parking and traffic revenues.\n\nDemand for parking on the Edwardsville campus has escalated as full-time student enrollment has increased. University Police conducted a recent survey that confirmed very few vacant parking spaces are available on campus to employees and students on numerous occasions during peak times.\n\nA 500-space parking lot is being created as part of the Evergreen Residence Hall construction scheduled for completion by fall semester 2007. University officials believe this parking lot plus the additional lot approved today will help alleviate some of the parking problems.\n\nIn other action affecting SIUE, the Board of Trustees approved construction of two instructional chemistry laboratories in the Biotechnology Laboratory Incubator (BLI) located in University Park. The BLI is located in University Park. The labs are estimated to cost $980,000 to be paid for through current University operating funds.\n\nSIUE has been requesting funding for several years from the state to renovate the current Science Building and construct a new laboratory building. Earlier this year, the General Assembly approved some $3 million for planning the proposed construction and renovation. Because of a growing backlog of students who require chemistry lab time, these new instructional labs will be used by students until the Science Laboratory Building can be built.\n\nIn a third matter today, the board voted to amend SIUE's policy on refunding mandatory fees for students who withdraw from the University. Currently, the University offers students a full or partial refund of mandatory fees for withdrawing by a prescribed deadline. In addition, the University retains an administrative fee of five percent of the assessed charges or $100, whichever is less, during the partial refund period.\n\n\"With this new action, the University will refund 100 percent of mandatory fees if a student withdraws by the end of the 3rd week of class but will not refund any mandatory fees beyond the 3rd week.\"\n\nThe overall financial impact to the University will be \"revenue neutral\" and the policy regarding tuition refunds does not change. Officials said the objective for this action is to bring the University's policies in line with the \"functionality\" of the University's new student information system.\n\nBack to top\n\n11/8/06\n\nSome SIUE Wrestlers Have Staph Skin Infections, Tests Show\n\n(EDWARDSVILLE, Ill.) Four Southern Illinois University Edwardsville wrestlers have been diagnosed with skin infections-three with methicillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), or staph infection, and a fourth with cellulitis.\n\nThe diagnoses were the result of cultures taken from three of the wrestlers last week by SIUE Health Service and another culture taken by the fourth wrestler's private physician. The SIUE results came back Monday from a local diagnostic lab.\n\nNone of the athletes have been quarantined and as a precaution all were administered a regimen of antibiotics immediately to treat a broad spectrum of infections. That same regimen has been continued for the affected athletes.\n\nAll of the athletes are not being identified under right to privacy laws. Four came to SIUE Health Service last week with unknown skin infections, said Riane Greenwalt, director of SIUE Health Service. The athletes were suspended from practice and competitions pending culture tests from the lab and clearance by a physician.\n\nWhen Greenwalt reported the situation to SIUE Intercollegiate Athletics Director Bradley L. Hewitt, the wrestling weight room and locker room were treated with an additional antimicrobial cleanser designed to kill staph bacteria. \"We wanted to be sure in case these infections did turn out to be staph related,\" Hewitt said.\n\n\"Wrestling is a very physical contact sport and staph infection among wrestlers is common,\" Hewitt said. \"That said, we've never had a problem with MRSA in the past at SIUE that I'm aware of.\" Hewitt also pointed out that the weight room, locker room and wrestling room are currently in use. \"We are confident we've cleared those rooms of MRSA bacteria and we're back to normal.\"\n\nMeanwhile, Greenwalt has been in contact with the entire wrestling team and the coaches to discuss proper hygiene and staph prevention. \"I also met with other representatives of Intercollegiate Athletics, as well as Campus Recreation, Kinesiology and Health Education, and Facilities Management. I spoke with them about how staph is spread and how to prevent it or limit it,\" she said.\n\n\"Keep in mind that each person has staph, a common bacteria, on their skin or in their nose. When there is a cut or a break in the skin, the skin may become compromised and susceptible to infection.\n\n\"While many staph infections can result in nothing more than a small pimple or boil, not requiring medication; other staph infections can become more serious,\" Greenwalt said. \"Outbreaks and 'cluster' infections can occur when several people have a common point of exposure.\"\n\nGreenwalt said Madison County Health Department was contacted once the skin infections were suspected as a cluster. \"We will continue to monitor the situation and communicate appropriately with the athletics areas involved.\"\n\nBack to top\n\n11/8/06\n\nSIUE Center Achieves National Certification\n\n(EDWARDSVILLE, Ill.)

Heralded a second year for its senior capstone experience, Southern Illinois University Edwardsville again joins the ranks of an elite 15 universities-including Yale, Harvard, MIT, Duke and Princeton-for its comprehensive programs measuring the competency of graduating seniors.\n\nAt SIUE, the program is called senior assignment and is required curriculum for all seniors to demonstrate their degree of general education knowledge, as well as knowledge within their disciplines prior to graduation.\n\nThe University again was included as a \"Top School\" in U.S. News, ranked 12th among public universities in the Midwestern master's universities category; 55th among all Midwestern master's universities, which includes 142 institutions. This is an improvement from the University's ranking as 58th last year-16th among public universities in the category.\n\nSIUE's senior assignment program has been recognized on several occasions, recently as a model for other institutions across the nation. In a report from The Association of American Colleges and Universities, SIUE's program was lauded as an effective tool in gauging the comprehensiveness of academic programs.\n\n\"Many places do not assess general education, but our assessment is all-encompassing,\" said Lesa Stern, director of SIUE's undergraduate assessment and program review, and the Undergraduate Research Academy. \"Some universities have a standard, ongoing assessment. Each department owns the senior assignment here so they can craft it to assess the skills and capabilities of graduates.\"\n\nIt was explained that SIUE's assessment program is not the same as traditional capstone programs, which assess individual learning. The University's senior assignment program assesses the overall program effectiveness and the degree of interdisciplinary competence among graduates.\n\n\"A good example of a senior assignment program here would be the public relations track of speech communication\" Stern said, noting seniors form small groups and each group submits a proposal to an outside company or organization outlining details of putting on a special event. Such organizations in the past have included the Collinsville Area Recreation District and the National Children's Cancer Society.\n\n\"In the spring, the students actually put on the event for these organizations,\" Stern said. \"If they do it well as senior assignment candidates, they can do it in the real world.\"\n\nThis type of assignment incorporates more than the knowledge gained during the students' track of study, Stern said, adding that it involves critical thinking, budgeting and people skills, and other skills that students gain during the early stages of study at the University.\n\nBack to top\n\n8/25/06\n\nSIUE School of Pharmacy on Track to Accreditation\n\n(EDWARDSVILLE, Ill.) The Southern Illinois University Edwardsville School of Pharmacy recently reached a milestone on its journey to accreditation status-achieving candidate status from the Accreditation Council for Pharmacy Education (ACPE.)\n\nCandidate status is \"critical to the continued development of our program because our graduates will have the same rights and privileges as graduates from a fully accredited program,\" said School of Pharmacy Dean Philip Medon. \"The receipt of candidate status from the ACPE is a major milestone in our School's history and reflects the confidence of ACPE in our planning and program implementation.\"\n\nThe SIUE School of Pharmacy achieved \"pre-candidate status\" in 2005. The latest announcement marks another great achievement in the School's young history.\n\n\"This status is extremely important for our School,\" Medon said of the recent ACPE candidate status designation. \"The final part of the process comes when the ACPE considers us for full accreditation. That occurs when the program is found to have met all ACPE standards for accreditation and has graduated its first class.\n\n\"It provides assurances to our students that upon graduation they will be considered to be graduates of an accredited program and will be eligible to take the NABPLEX licensure examination to become practicing pharmacists.\"\n\nThe National Association of Boards of Pharmacy License Examination (NABPLEX) is the required exam that pharmacists must pass to obtain licensure to practice in the United States.\n\nThe SIUE School of Pharmacy, the only downstate Illinois Pharmacy doctorate program, opened in Aug. 2005. The first class will graduate in spring 2009, at which time the ACPE will make another site visit to determine whether the School will become accredited.\n\n\"SIUE is also on target to meet its mission of providing an opportunity for pharmacy education to residents in Southern and Central Illinois,\" Medon said. \""
