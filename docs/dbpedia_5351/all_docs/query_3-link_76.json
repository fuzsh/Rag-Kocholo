        "text": "MARC 'Elvis' Priestley is a former F1 mechanic and pitstop crew member who's gone on to become a TV presenter.\n\nHe's a host on the much-loved show Wheeler Dealers — here's everything you need to know about him.\n\nWho is Marc Priestley?\n\nMarc 'Elvis' Priestley, born on October 6, 1976, is a TV presenter, speaker, author and former F1 mechanic.\n\nIn November 2020, it was announced that Priestley would be joining Mike Brewer on Discovery’s Wheeler Dealers.\n\nThe premise of the show is that Brewer and Priestley have a mission to save old vehicles, fix up old cars on a budget, and sell them to a new owner.\n\nThe hit show finished its 27th series in September 2024 — but fans of the show have been left hanging in the balance as it has yet to be confirmed whether there will be a 28th season.\n\nBut the petrol heads were back with an incredible World Tour series of the show in April 2024.\n\nSpeaking exclusively to The Sun, Priestley said: \"I think we both hope there's going to be more specials and we're already well into discussions about doing more of this world tour.\n\n\"We've done 10 episodes but there are so many more places we no know this show is hugely popular in parts of the world we can do more.\n\n\"There are so many stories, we've already fleshed out nearly 20 more stories we can tell so we're hoping we can do more of this because it's been a wonderful and as Mike said at the beginning, I think it's probably the best thing we've ever done, the best show we've ever made.\"\n\nHe continued: \"Not only is it the best show we've ever made, but we know we can make it even better, so how about that? That's kind of exciting for us.\n\n\"We've come back with this amazing show that we can't wait for the audience globally to see it.\n\n\"But although we've now made it and gone around the world doing it, we've gone 'oh well we could have done that a bit better, we could've spent a bit more time on this'.\"\n\n\"We know we can improve it next time round.\"\n\nAside from Wheeler Dealers, Priestley was the host of Discovery Channel’s Driving Wild and co-host of The F1 Report on Sky Sports F1 HD.\n\nDuring his career, he has also worked as a technical pundit for ITV4’s FIA Formula E coverage.\n\nWhy is Marc Priestley nicknamed Elvis?\n\nAccording to Priestley, the nickname 'Elvis' first evolved during his school years, where there were a number of children named Marc in his class.\n\nI think [Wheeler Dealers World Tour is] probably the best thing we've ever done, the best show we've ever made\n\nMarc Priestley\n\nIn an interview with Owen James, Priestley previously explained: ''It’s nothing to do with my singing, I can tell you that.\n\n''The name goes back to my primary school years where there were a number of Marc’s in my class.\n\n''Somebody thought Priestley sounded like Presley and the name Elvis stuck.''\n\n''I don’t expect people in the F1 paddock know me as anything other than Elvis.''\n\nDid Marc Priestley work in F1?\n\nPriestley is no stranger to the world of Formula One.\n\nHe worked as an F1 race mechanic, pit-stop crew member and in team management at one of F1’s most successful organisations, McLaren Racing, for almost a decade before turning to a career in media.\n\nPriestley has worked with a number of notable names including, Mika Hakkinen, Fernando Alonso, Kimi Raikkonen, Jenson Button and Lewis Hamilton.\n\nAway from life in the fast lane, he also hosts a podcast series titled Pitlane Life Lessons, during which he ''delves deep into the lessons we can all learn from the elite world of F1 racing''.\n\nListeners can enjoy weekly episodes from inside the pinnacle of motorsport — sharing stories of the secrets that a life in Formula One has to offer.\n\nIs Marc Priestley on social media?\n\nThe Wheeler Dealers host is in fact an active user of social media.\n\nAs of July 2024, Priestley boasts over 60,000 followers on Instagram — where he shares a number of snaps alongside co-host Mike Brewer.\n\nFans of the host can keep up to date with his life and latest ventures over on the social media platform, under the handle @f1elvis."
