        "text": "Wheeler Dealers is coming home! Wheeler Dealers series 17 will return to the UK for the first time in six years and be filmed on home soil. The change of location means that mechanic Ant Anstead will step back and be replaced by Marc ‘Elvis’ Priestley, who joins the show as Mike Brewer’s new co-host.\n\nThe Wheeler Dealers family – Mike Brewer, Ant Anstead and Marc Priestley – took to zoom to discuss the changes to the show and their own involvement in the world’s biggest motoring show. Knowing a man on the inside, Mike Brewer Motoring has the exclusive first look at the guys in conversation.\n\nNew presenter Marc Priestley, nicknamed Elvis, previously worked as a Formula One race mechanic for McLaren, and following his stint with the iconic racing organisation, has co-hosted a number of shows including Wheeler Dealers: Dream Car and Driving Wild. He is regularly seen on screen as a commentator and pundit for Sky Sports.\n\nAfter a memorable few years on the show, Ant Anstead will be departing as a series regular, but assured us he’ll still be popping in the Wheeler Dealers workshop. His last series will be seen in the UK in January 2021. Ant has decided to remain in the US to be close to family and concentrate on his new TV projects which are expected to air next year.\n\nDue to be filmed near the renowned Bicester Heritage Site, a former RAF base known for its historic motoring excellence, Wheeler Dealers will have access to the numerous automotive workshops in the locality.\n\nThe new series will again see Mike share his enthusiasm for cars as he hunts down iconic motors and uses his expertise to give viewers first class tips on how to transform them. With the help of Elvis, the pair will reveal their ambitious plans to restore a range of vehicles for a tidy profit, all while delving into the compelling design and manufacturing stories of each car.\n\nIn the video, Mike Brewer also revealed that he and ‘Elvis’ will be working on another series of Wheeler Dealers: Dream Car.\n\nThe first series saw the team help car lovers trade-up their daily driver to get them the car of their dreams. Each episode saw Mike and Elvis meet a new client and find inventive ways to add value to their existing vehicle, before flipping it for a profit and reinvesting the proceeds in a series of trade-ups that result in a dream car. From auction houses and salvage yards, to the mechanical workshop, Mike and Elvis revealed the secrets of trading up, sharing their expertise on how to add value, read markets and make deals to score the ultimate motor.\n\nSimon Downing, SVP, Head of Factual and Sport, Discovery UK said: “Bringing Wheeler Dealers back to the UK is an exciting moment for us. We’d like to thank Ant for doing a truly amazing job, he will always remain a member of the Wheeler Dealers family and will be making some special appearances in future episodes. A warm welcome to Marc ‘Elvis’ Priestley who has already proved a hit among fans in the spin-off Dream Car.”\n\nThe new series of Wheeler Dealers with the change of host will be aired on Discovery Channel in Autumn 2021.\n\nFind more info:\n\nDiscovery Channel"
