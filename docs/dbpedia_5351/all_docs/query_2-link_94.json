        "text": "Wheeler Dealers Mike Brewer and Ant Anstead return to our TV screens this summer with a brand-new series, here’s when it’s on TV, what cars they’re working on and everything you need to know…\n\nIn the new series, broadcast exclusively on Discovery Channel, the dynamic duo continues to track down classic and iconic vehicles in need of some TLC, with each episode challenging the pair to restore a car to its former glory before selling it on for a profit.\n\nMike is charged with finding vehicles that have money-making potential, while master mechanic Ant can usually be found in the Wheeler Dealers workshop, working on everything from bare metal resprays to gearbox conversions.\n\nThis season zips from the sunny beaches of southern California to the coldest edges of Maine as the diverse used car market of the United States is combed for the best vehicles to buy, restore, test and eventually pass on to enthusiastic new owners.\n\nWheeler Dealers returns exclusively to Discovery Channel on 31 August 2020 at 9:00pm\n\nWheeler Dealers episodes for series 16 are as follows:\n\n1 – 1969 Datsun Sports 2000\n\n31 August 2020\n\n9:00pm\n\nPredating Datsun’s popular Z-car line, the classic Datsun Sports roadster was arguably Japan’s first blue-collar export market sports car, and its sporting prowess was underlined by an enviable race record\n\n2 – 2001 Audi S4 Avant Quattro\n\n7 September 2020\n\n9:00pm\n\nEverybody loves a fast estate, and with its bi-turbo V6 and trademark quattro all-wheel drive system, the Type 8D generation S4 Avant is widely regarded as one of the most potent and capable of them all\n\n3 – 2001 Saab 9-3 Viggen\n\n14 September 2020\n\n9:00pm\n\nInspired by the Saab 37 Viggen fighter jet, the 9-3 Viggen was the sporting flagship of Saab’s 9-3 line and represented the Swedish manufacturer’s first real attempt to launch an in-house performance division\n\n4 – 2006 Porsche Cayenne Turbo S\n\n21 September 2020\n\n9:00pm\n\n5 2004 Mazdaspeed MX-5\n\n28 September 2020\n\n9:00pm\n\nAvailable for a brief two-year period, this Mazdaspeed car has the distinction of being the only factory-built version in the history of the MX-5 to be equipped with a performance-enhancing turbocharger conversion\n\n6 – 1979 Jeep CJ-7 Levi Edition\n\n5 October 2020\n\n9:00pm\n\nIt comes as no surprise to discover that Jeep’s partnership with Levi transformed this CJ’s upholstery and soft-top, yet it became one of the most popular options of this now highly sought-after off-roader\n\n7 – 1991 Nissan 300ZX\n\n12 October 2020\n\n9:00pm\n\nLaunched at the height of Japan’s bubble economy, when optimism was sky-high and Nissan’s engineers chased their dreams, the second-gen 300ZX was a technical marvel… and an engine plumbing nightmare"
