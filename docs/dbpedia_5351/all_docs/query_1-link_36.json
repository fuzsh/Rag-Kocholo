        "text": "This year we welcome some new faces to the discovery+ Live Stage with ‘Auto Alex’ Kersten and The Late Brake Show’s Jonny Smith joining Wheeler Dealers’ Mike Brewer.\n\nBest known for presenting Car Throttle and his hilarious impressions of his ‘TV Dad’ Mike Brewer, journalist Alex Kersten can now be seen on YouTube. Launched last October, his ‘Auto Alex’ channel showcases his passion for buying ‘modern classics’ and the cheapest cars Alex can find!\n\nAlex said: “I’m so excited to be joining Mike on stage at the show. As well as presenting, I’m also going to be bringing along my infamous Mazda MX-5, which has appeared in so many of my videos, so people can see just what it’s really like up close!”\n\nJoining Mike and Alex is former Fifth Gear presenter Jonny Smith. Renowned for his passion for modified vehicles, Jonny now hosts The Late Brake Show on YouTube where he test drives a whole feast of Restomods as well as discovering Barn Finds and interviewing fellow motoring enthusiasts.\n\nMike and the team will host an entertaining mix of interviews, car cavalcades, topical motoring panels as well as Q&A sessions.\n\nThey will also welcome the team from Practical Classics who will be rebuilding deputy editor James Walshe’s Citroen 2CV over the show weekend, which was near on destroyed earlier in the year, and drive it off the stage at the end of the show.\n\nMike said: “I can’t wait to get back on stage at the NEC and I’m looking forward to working with Alex and Jonny. It’s going to be great fun and I’m sure we’ll keep the crowds entertained.”\n\nThe discovery+ Live Stage is just one of many features on offer such as the Sporting Bears’ Dream Rides Garage, Restoration Theatre and Meguiar’s Club Showcase."
