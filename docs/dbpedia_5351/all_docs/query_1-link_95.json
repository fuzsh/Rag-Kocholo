        "text": "I’ve enjoyed watching Ant Anstead more in this series than the big man in the last few\n\nAlso Edd left as they were going to dumb it down, but it seems to be the same level as it was before\n\nBrewer is still a giant spherical knob though, so he gets skipped through\n\nAgreed in part.\n\nI like Ant, and he doesn’t seem to be doing any less work, or simpler jobs than Edd did.\n\nDownsides are, Mike is in it more than ever, his opening bit is longer, his, well lets call it “here’s what powder coating is for the 80th time” middle section is long, as is his ending bit. I still don’t know why.\n\nI skip the opening bit if I can, never watch the last bit and suffer the Powder Coating, it makes for about 15 mins of programme for me.\n\nI enjoyed Edd and Mike when they tripped over to the US, plenty of cars from there that I remember as a yoof..\n\nAdd did get a little annoyed with Mike towards the end, and rightly so. The series whilst informative started to get dull and Edd could clearly tell it had a finite end. The sarcasm shone through, which I liked actually. That one episode where Mike had to take over the whole show was hilarious..\n\nI’ll admit being sceptical about Ant, clearly Mikes choice of co-presenter limits his options to folks that have only 3 syllables in their name… But he’s turned out as annoying, if not more than I’d imagined… too glib, too “in yer face” and possibly too cocky.\n\nAnt is more than some car mechanic though, he recently did a nature programme with Kate Humble and I found that a little odd.. He was there just presenting, so whilst he likes mucking about with cars he’s in it for the presenting IMO.\n\nHow long the show will last I’ve no idea, but the series with Edd in I watched quite avidly, this series I’m missing out and forgetting to record them.. which shows how much I care about it all now.\n\nHow long the show will last I’ve no idea, but the series with Edd in I watched quite avidly, this series I’m missing out and forgetting to record them.. which shows how much I care about it all now.\n\nIt’s an interesting point.\n\nVelocity who bought the show from Discovery UK did so because it was very popular in the US, but then changed a lot about it, although Edd leaving wasn’t planned. I wonder if they threw out the baby with the bathwater by making it more palatable for the US they’ve eroded what the audience liked about it in the first place. Make no mistake, it’s not made for the few hundred thousand UK viewers any more.\n\nI guess it was inevitable is was going to become more mainstream, more ‘Human Interest’ proper geeks don’t need to trawl the big numbers on sky any more for stuff that suits them, YouTube has an army of people who’ll make really geeky shows for the hardcore.\n\nI think the Escort Cosworth venture was to enliven a staid format, a show that gave the viewer a “oh, this isn’t what Edd did” then it sort of fell a little flat again.\n\nOh well.\n\nAnd Edds new show, it’s Ok. Only time will tell if it’s worth continuing on with. The VW Golf he did was a bit odd… He sort of left the owner to do most of the work and I kinda missed the Edd bit in the show where he got his hands dirty. He’s moving more into an advisory position and I hope he develops his TV persona enough before the series gets canned.\n\nThey properly fell out.\n\nRumour has it Mike locked the garage where Edds tools were and refused to engage in any conversations about getting them back t him/collect them. On Youtube there are a few vids of Edd trying to get in contact with him and also a couple where he’s stalking the production company trying to get hold of anyone to help.\n\nBizarre really.\n\nThen theres the vid of Mike properly laying into Edd off camera edit, where he’s calling him all sorts of choice names and frankly being a proper dick.\n\nBut, the recent vids by Edd about it all gloss over what was probably quite a tense situation for a while."
