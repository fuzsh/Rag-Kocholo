        "text": "LOCALS living along the North Coast 500 have called for local councils to enforce stricter overnight parking rules on motorhomes.\n\nBut many have said that they fear harsher restrictions \"won't work\" and will only make the problem worse.\n\nResidents in the Scottish Highlands have been left unimpressed with tourists' behaviour along the iconic route in recent months.\n\nMany have complained to the local authority after noticing that car parks are being overrun with campervans and caravans.\n\nAnd others have hit out at \"disrespectful\" motorhome owners who have been caught parking their vehicles in graveyards, in front of people's homes, blocking them in, and pulling up overnight in shop car parks.\n\nAs a result, they have called on the Highland Council to impose similar overnight motorhome parking restrictions that are being introduced down south.\n\nNorth Yorkshire Council announced that they are trialling a new scheme along the coast after locals in Scarborough complained about parking problems.\n\nLike many places along the NC500, Scarborough has seen significant numbers of motorhomes congregating in hotspot areas.\n\nIt's just getting worse year on year, and until something 'serious' is done and enforced, it will continue to get worse\n\nIt sparked a flurry of complaints from residents and safety fears after a number of fires were set alight and then abandoned.\n\nOver a course of 18 months, strict parking restrictions will be put in place from 11pm to 7am for motorhomes and campervans.\n\nThe restrictions will be introduced on the A174 Sandsend to Raithwaite, on Royal Albert Drive on Scarborough’s North Bay and Osgodby Hill and Filey Road in Cayton Bay.\n\nA decision on whether the trial will go ahead will be made next week, but it has prompted locals in the Highlands to urge the local authority to follow its lead.\n\nA local posted in the NC500 The Dirty Truth Facebook group as they called for similar trials along the route.\n\nBut many have said they think \"it won't work\" north of the border.\n\nThe post sharing the news of the trials in North Yorkshire said: \"Does anyone think this would actually work up here?\n\n\"Strange how their council can listen to residents but not our own\".\n\nUsers quickly flocked to comments to debate the situation, with many saying they didn't think it would help.\n\nOne person said: \"It won’t work in Scotland, as there’s vast amounts of area for them to move to overnight. Yorkshire, if you want to be near the sea, there’s not many alternatives. Other than a camp site. This will prob send more north!!\"\n\nAnother added: \"It'll be abused, unless they have enforcement, the same as the NC500. They should never have opened up such a large number of spaces. Their best bet would be to have 10 spaces, booked and payable in advance online.\"\n\nSomeone else wrote: \"It's ridiculous as most don't even bother paying.\"\n\nAnd a fourth posted: \"I can't see the trial being introduced in Scarborough.\"\n\nHowever, others supported the idea and urged the council to give it a try.\n\nA user commented: \"These vanners have had it too good for too long, they expect someone else to pay for their holiday, wanting free this, free that, time they put their hands in their pockets and realise the world doesn’t revolve around them and their holiday or living needs or requirements.\"\n\nWhile a second agreed: \"Should have happened over the summer\".\n\nAnd another chimed in: \"Highland could do it if the Council wanted. I believe most people would pay attention to signage although enforcement would still be needed to reinforce the message.\"\n\nA fourth praised: \"Well done to the council for introducing this. Make them find an appropriate location to park and get them to pay for it. This mindset of parking where one likes for nothing has to change\".\n\nSomeone else added: \"If Scarborough can do it why can't Highland?\"\n\nWhile a sixth said: \"It's just getting worse year on year, and until something 'serious' is done and enforced, it will continue to get worse\"."
