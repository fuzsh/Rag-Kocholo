        "text": "A career in the car trade led Mike Brewer into television, where his enthusiasm shone through in shows such as Driven, Deals on Wheels and Pulling Power. In his current series, Wheeler Dealers, he and master mechanic Edd China buy and restore cars to sell – preferably for a tidy profit.\n\nWhat was your first car, and why did you buy it?\n\nI found that having a girlfriend when you ride a scooter wasn’t going to get me far, so I bought a Mini 850cc. In beige.\n\nHow old were you when you first became interested in cars?\n\nYoung. My dad was a car customiser and would take me to shows from the age of nine. I loved them.\n\nWhat car or incident inspired your passion for cars?\n\nSelling my first Mini for three times what I bought it for, after tidying it up. I thought: “That was easy, I’ll keep doing that.”\n\nWhat was your first crash – if you’ve ever had one?\n\nOn the way to my job as a car salesman when I was 19, a lorry hit me head-on and I broke off the steering wheel on my way out of the windscreen. I was very shaken and bruised, but I was alive.\n\nWhich car do you most regret selling, and why?\n\nOn Wheeler Dealers, it had to be the Ford Mustang, a genuine classic from the Sixties. That soulful V8 engine and those sloping lines, magic. So I went out and bought a similar car straight after the show.\n\nWhat’s the worst car you’ve owned, and why?\n\nAgain on the show, it has to be the Suzuki SJ410. It was a truly hideous car with no chance of getting through an MoT test, but the television deadline meant I had to buy it.\n\nWhat’s your biggest pet peeve when driving?\n\nSeeing other drivers on their phones, texting, talking, Facebooking – in fact, those doing anything apart from concentrating on the road.\n\nWhat is your dream car, money no object?\n\nA late-Twenties Bentley 4.5‑litre Blower. All I can say is “Wow”.\n\nAnd your most memorable experience in a car?\n\nBreaking the 24-hour Endurance Land Speed Record in a Volvo S60 T5 back in 2000. The record still stands.\n\nWhat are your current projects?\n\nWheeler Dealers is about to be broadcast globally, so there have been lots of publicity events. We [Brewer and Edd China] are busy planning the next shows and last weekend we did live appearances at the classic car show at the NEC. I also have to find time to be a dad and a husband. It’s busy.\n\nA new season of Wheeler Dealers is on Discovery Channel every Monday at 9pm\n\nFor all the latest news, advice and reviews from Telegraph Cars, sign up to our weekly newsletter by entering your email here\n\nA-Z car finder\n\nMy first car\n\nBen Hanlin\n\nTrevor Nelson\n\nAmy Williams"
