        "text": "Anthony Richard Anstead (born March 1979) is an English television presenter, motor specialist, car builder, designer, and artist, best known for co-presenting the Channel 4 automotive show For the Love of Cars with Philip Glenister. From 2017-2021, Anstead replaced Edd China as co-host of the show Wheeler Dealers, (S.14 -16) alongside Mike Brewer, during the filming and production at their US base.\n\nEarly life\n\nAnstead was born in Plymouth, Devon, England. He lived in Ely, Cambridgeshire, until he was 10, then moved with his family to Hertfordshire. He was educated at Richard Hale School, Hertford, then attended the nearby Haileybury School to complete his A-levels. At sixteen Anstead built his first kit car and sold it immediately for a profit. He then bought an MG and so began his infatuation with cars.\n\nEarly career\n\nAnstead joined Hertfordshire Constabulary in 1999 and became a Police Constable first stationed at Bishop's Stortford. He moved to Cheshunt police station and then became a member of the Tactical Firearms Team (TFU) in Welwyn Garden City. During his early police career, Anstead guarded John Duffy the convicted Railway Murderer for 3 days in a police safe house. He went on to receive two commendations for acts of bravery.\n\nIn 2005 Anstead resigned from the Police to pursue a career as a car builder. He started building and restoring cars for clients and built recreation cars and one-offs.\n\nAnstead played semi-professional football for over 15 years playing over 700 matches at Ryman level, and made the transition from goalkeeper to striker, most notably becoming the only player to win Ryman league promotions in both positions.\n\nTelevision career\n\nAnstead started his own television production company in 2014, producing his own show The World’s Most Expensive Cars.\n\nIn 2014, he was approached to host a new Channel 4 car show with British actor Philip Glenister. Since then Anstead has hosted a number of television shows, and in 2015 he hosted BBC Two's live show Building Cars Live, alongside James May and Kate Humble.\n\nAnstead hosts the live stages of some of the UK's car shows as well as after-dinner speaking and motivational speaking in schools and for charities.\n\nIn his 2019 TV show Ant Anstead Master Mechanic, Anstead uses a variety of components, from spare parts to donor cars to hand-build an homage to the Alfa Romeo 158. The show sees Anstead work with a variety of automotive personalities and experts in the field.\n\nIn addition to Master Mechanic, Anstead is also part of the new 'World's Greatest Cars'\" series. The show sees a panel of motoring experts cover the five greatest sports cars ever made. The cars are evaluated on their iconic designs and game-changing performance.\n\nWheeler Dealers\n\nIn 2017, Anstead was offered a five-year contract to move with his family to the United States for Wheeler Dealers USA and to replace co-host and close friend Edd China, who had decided to return to the UK.\n\nThree years later, production was transferred back to the UK without Anstead, as he has a young son, Hudson who is settled in the US with his former partner Christina Hall with whom he shares custody.\n\nPersonal life\n\nAnstead has a daughter, Amelie, and son, Archie, with his first wife Louise. They divorced in 2017.\n\nHe started dating American television personality Christina Haack in October 2017. On 22 December 2018, they married at their Newport Beach, California home. Their son Hudson was born in September 2019. The couple separated in September 2020 and divorced the following year.\n\nIn April 2021, seven months after his split from Haack, he began a relationship with American actress Renée Zellweger with whom he had filmed a TV series.\n\nAnstead is patron of Harrison's Fund, a charity that supports research into Duchenne muscular dystrophy.\n\nFilmography\n\nTelevision"
