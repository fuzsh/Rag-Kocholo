        "text": "Judging by the response to our story about Edd China leaving Wheeler Dealers last week, it seems a lot of you are sad to see him go. However, some have chosen to take their anger about the trigger for Ed’s leaving - the production company ‘dumbing down’ the show - out on presenter Mike Brewer.\n\nChina today released a video mentioning that Brewer and his family have been on the receiving end of vitriol from angry Wheeler Dealers fans. He said: “Mike called me at the weekend and told me that over the past few days; not only he, but also his wife and daughter had been receiving a lot of abuse and even death threats, because of my leaving the show, and that’s really NOT cool.” Not cool indeed.\n\nWhile he conceded Mike is “probably not” his “favourite person at right now” and that “I know for sure I am not his,” he urged fans to move on and look forward to the prospect of potentially having two great workshop-related shows to watch - Wheeler Dealers, and whatever China does next.\n\nIt’s sad that China had to make this video at all, but hopefully the abuse aimed at Brewer and his family will now die down."
