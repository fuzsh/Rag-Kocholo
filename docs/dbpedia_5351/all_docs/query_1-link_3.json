        "text": "Star of Wheeler Dealers, Mike Brewer took to social media to confirm that they will no longer be filming the spin-off show Wheeler Dealers: Dream Car. The presenter, 60, posted on X, formerly known as Twitter, revealing that there are no plans to bring it back despite high viewing figures.\n\nA user took to the social networking site and asked Mike how they could apply for the show. Mike responded to the tweet and said: “We no longer make the series and won’t be in the future, so don’t click on any scam websites.”\n\nHowever, X user @CarlosFandang01 chimed in and was adamant he knew why the Dream Car show was axed. He commented: “TV programmes are all about viewer numbers, the higher the viewers, the more Ad revenue they can demand it, if it was a popular show they’d be making more, however they’re not, so it must have had poor viewing figures.\"\n\nWhile confirming that Wheeler Dealers will return to the small screen, Mike hit back by saying that it: “[Wheeler Dealers: Dream Car] was rated the second highest show on Discovery after Wheeler Dealers!” He admitted that the production company “just simply can’t find time to make any more as well as traditional Wheeler Dealers”.\n\nThe long-standing Discovery show recently wrapped up its 18th season last month. It saw Mike find a rare, 33-year-old Peugeot 405 while in Portugal.\n\nTalking on his Car Dealer podcast, he explained how the showroom started out as a storage unit for his private car collection.\n\nHe and his wife, Michelle, along with a pal of his, initially set up One Automotive in Warwick. The set-up was a similar partnership to his Mike Brewer Motors dealership.\n\nFollowing Covid, Mike saw a gap in the market as people were looking for new vehicles and wanted something not quite so run-of-the-mill. However, there were shortages worldwide, creating a demand.\n\nSo, Mike and his team went about smartening vehicles up. He used body kits and exhaust trims to give them a new fresh look.\n\nMike said: “We wanted to capture a slightly different area of the market – the sort of tradespeople who want to promote their businesses with a different sort of van.\""
