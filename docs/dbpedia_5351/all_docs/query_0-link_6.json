        "text": "Just found this related show, Deals on wheels from 1997.\n\nWhat was that show with a bloke (Tony? Tommy?) building a kit car?\n\nSomeone put boot polish on the inside of his safety goggles and when he took them off he spent the rest of the programme looking like a startled Panda.... Class!\n\nAs I've been known to watch a bit too much telly, have quite a good memory, don't mind doing a bit of research and can occasionally be arsed to write something comprehensive I thought I would create this handy, accurate*, pocket-sized*, comprehensive* guide to motoring tv shows because being a car enthusiast means you'll often watch some right old tat because it has motors in it.\n\nWith the exception of the first you should most of these on TV (sometimes on obscure channels at odd times) or on the internet or for sale on dvd/blu-ray.\n\nWheelbase\n\nWhen: 1964-1973\n\nEpisodes:207\n\nMade by: The BBC.\n\nPresenters: Cliff Michelmore, Gordon Wilkins, LJK Setright\n\nI have never seen this but it would appear to have been an informative motoring show which proceeded Old Top Gear. I imagine that the backgrounds of location shoots will be mecca for tat spotters, nevermind the features such as an interview with William Lyons and a Gilbern special.\n\nhttp://ftvdb.bfi.org.uk/sift/series/1401\n\nIf that wasn't enough, check out this title shot.\n\nIf anyone finds this show (YaTube, online, download, vhs, dvd etc) I really need to see it.\n\nGood Points:?\n\nBad Points:?\n\nWorth watching for:?\n\nOld \"Top Gear\"\n\nWhen: 1977-2001\n\nEpisodes:515\n\nMade by: The BBC.\n\nPresenters: William (one foot on bumper, one hand on raised knee) Woollard, Noel Edmonds, Tony Mason, Angela Rippon, VBH, Quentin Wilson, Chris Goffey, Clarkson, James May, Steve Berry, Brendan Coogan, Jon Bentley, Adrian Simpson, Tiffany Dell and probably quite a few others over 24 years.\n\nInformative motoring show, anchored by Woolard (later a different one of the presenters each week) featuring lots of informative features and lingering shots of switchgear and bootspaces. Great for figuring out whether to buy the Montego 1.6 GL or Cavalier 1.6 GLS.\n\nLater increased viewing figures by becoming more sensationalist and heading away information for the average motorist.\n\nSpawned Top Gear Rally Report (remember when rallying was popular?) and yearly British motorshow coverage.\n\nGood Points:Pick a car from '77-'01 and find contemporary road tests on YaTube.\n\nBad Points: Noel Edmonds pans Fiat Strada, early episodes can be dull.\n\nWorth watching for: Huge sea change in motoring attitudes over 24 year period.\n\nNew \"Top Gear\"\n\nWhen: 2002 - present\n\nEpisodes: shitloads, they're all on Dave.\n\nMade by: The BBC.\n\nPresenters: Jeremy Clarkson, Richard Hammond, James May (replaced Jason Dawe)\n\nPopular entertainment show dressed up as a car show, features celebrity guests, powerslides in expensive cars, foolish challenges, destruction of old BL tat, dismissive attitude to used cars and classics and grammatically poor use of the word \"horsepower\" and \"torque\".\n\nGood Points:Makes motoring fun for the masses, Jeremy Clarkson, exotic cars, specials (south america, north pole, vietnam), beautifully shot.\n\nBad Points: Jeremy Clarkson, poor attitude to old cars, India special.\n\nWorth watching for: Different things to different people.\n\nTop Gear America\n\nWhen: 2010 - present\n\nEpisodes: 26\n\nMade by: BBC Worldwide\n\nPresenters: Redneck in a check-shirt, slick racing driver and (sometimes) angry New England type.\n\nUS version of British New Top Gear, slightly less populist, slightly more car focused but American-biased.\n\nLike/dislike of the presenters can greatly affect enjoyment of this show.\n\nGood Points: American motoring perspective, beautifully shot.\n\nBad Points: American motoring perspective and attitude toward non-US cars, whooping and hollering of audience.\n\nWorth watching for: Challenges, better execution that UK TG.\n\nTop Gear Australia\n\nWhen: 2008 - 2011\n\nEpisodes: 24\n\nMade by: BBC Worldwide\n\nPresenters: Blokes. OZZIE BLOKES. THREE OF THEM!\n\nOZ version of British New Top Gear, slightly less populist, slightly more car focused but American-biased.\n\nLike/dislike of the presenters can greatly affect enjoyment of this show.\n\nGood Points: OZ motoring perspective, beautifully shot, OZ historical pieces.\n\nBad Points: Star in a Bog Standard car. Never heard of any of them.\n\nWorth watching for: Love of V8s.\n\nTop Gear Russia\n\nWhen: 2009\n\nEpisodes: 17 or so\n\nMade by: BBC Worldwide\n\nPresenters: Three russian blokes, one of which is a carbon copy of Hammond\n\nCarbon Copy of UK show. In russian\n\nGood Points: You don't need subtitles, just turn the sound down and imagine what Clarkson-ski, May-ski and Hammond-ski are saying. If you've seen more than three episodes of UK TG you'll be fine.\n\nBad Points: Lack of Ladas, UAZ, GAZ, URAL, Volga et al.\n\nWorth watching for: UAZ feature (there was one, once)\n\nTop Gear China & Top Gear Korea\n\nWhen: In the past few years.\n\nEpisodes: some\n\nMade by: BBC Worldwide\n\nI have never seen these shows.\n\nDriven\n\nWhen: 1998-2002\n\nEpisodes: 80\n\nMade by: Independent for Channel 4\n\nPresenters: Penny mallory, Jason potato, annoying cockney twat Mike Brewer, Jason Barlow, James May\n\nMotor show originally competing with Old Top Gear. Featured presenter interaction and central location (sound familiar?) when TG didn't. Attempt at motoring info with group tests, 2nd hand buys etc, let down by element of silly challenges.\n\nGood Points: Cars of the period.\n\nBad Points: Dull Penny Mallory & annoying cockney twat Mike Brewer.\n\nWorth watching for: ....\n\n5th Gear / Fifth Gear\n\nWhen: 2002 - present\n\nEpisodes: 195\n\nMade by: Independent for Channel 5, later Discovery UK\n\nPresenters: Jason potato, Tom Ford, Tiffany Dell, VBH, Jonny Smith, Qunetin Wilson, Jon Bentley and some others.\n\nReplacement for old Top Gear, swiftly crushed in the ratings by New Top Gear. Far more of car show but struggling with the balance of silly challenges in the name of entertainment and viewing figures (eg racehorse v Range Rover on road tyres)\n\nGood Points: Openness to alternative technologies. VBH, if you like that sort of thing.\n\nBad Points: Ratings chasing acts such as bringing in non-car presenter Tim Lovejoy to get football fans to watch the show and stupid celebrity challenges.\n\nWorth watching for: Facts and figure based sports car track tests.\n\nDeals on Wheels\n\nWhen: 1997-2001\n\nEpisodes: quite a few.\n\nMade by: Independent for Channel 4\n\nPresenters: Richard Sutton and annoying cockney twat Mike Brewer\n\nClassic car journalist Sutton and annoying cockney twat Mike Brewer present real people selling real old cars, the background to sale is shown and then the two presenters discuss the points to watch on the car with a price prediction followed by footage of the sale conclusion. Also buying advice for one other model and sale/car/money challenges for one or both presenters.\n\nGood Points: Oddball cars\n\nBad Points: annoying cockney twat Mike Brewer.\n\nWorth watching for: At least one autoshiter appeared.\n\nWheeler Dealers\n\nWhen: 2003 - present\n\nEpisodes: quite a few.\n\nMade by: Independent for Discovery UK\n\nPresenters: Ed China and annoying cockney twat Mike Brewer\n\nAnnoying cockney twat Mike Brewer buys a car, Ed fixes/mods/upgrades car and then Annoying cockney twat Mike Brewer sells car on for a \"profit\", info on car and parts suppliers / specialists included.\n\nGood Points: Oddball cars\n\nBad Points: annoying cockney twat Mike Brewer, Cost of Ed's time.\n\nWorth watching for: Prices/deals done. Annoying cockney twat Mike Brewer.\n\nAuto Trader\n\nWhen: Recently\n\nEpisodes: not too many.\n\nMade by: Independent for Discovery UK\n\nPresenters: Ed China and annoying cockney twat Mike Brewer\n\nAnnoying cockney twat Mike Brewer guides a buyer through their purchasing query (mid-life crises sports car, work truck etc) with test drives, prices and common faults, Ed fixes up a car that a punter is struggling to sell and Annoying cockney twat Mike Brewer does a how to spot a dodgy .... feature.\n\nGood Points: Ed's fixing up\n\nBad Points: annoying cockney twat Mike Brewer\n\nWorth watching for: Punter's trying to sell some total shit heaps.\n\nRevved Up\n\nWhen: Early Noughties\n\nEpisodes: not too many.\n\nMade by: Independent for UK satellite channel\n\nPresenters: annoying cockney twat Mike Brewer\n\nAnnoying cockney twat Mike Brewer talks nonsense with barry-boys Max Power types, air filter big bore exhaust, shit bodykits for hatchback etc. The series progressed mods to Mike's car, a k-series engined bubble Rover.\n\nGood Points: ...\n\nBad Points: annoying cockney twat Mike Brewer\n\nWorth watching for: annoying cockney twat Mike Brewer\n\nPulling Power\n\nPulling Power was a regional motoring programme shown only in the Central Television region on ITV in 1996. However, it returned in 2005 and was shown on the ITV1 on a series trial basis until 2008, and it was also as a filler programme at times. It has also been shown on ITV4. Presenters included annoying cockney twat Mike Brewer, Michele Newman and Mike Rutherford, Sarah-Jane Mee and Edd China.\n\nI don't remember this show and can only find one clip on YaTube.\n\nIt appears to be total crap.\n\nWrecks to Riches\n\nWhen: Recently\n\nEpisodes: not too many.\n\nMade by: Independent for UK satellite channel\n\nPresenters: Dominic Littlewood, VBH (later some other bird), Connor the workshop manager and one or two workshop monkeys.\n\nLittlwood meets the punter with a purchasing quandry (desire or need for first car / big 4x4 /sports car/ mpv) and not enough cash. Littlewood then sources a write-off to fix and modify for the punter. The workshop monkeys moan about the work Dom's given them and Connor moans about the money. VBH drives a non-write off example in a road test and points out how expensive it is.
