        "text": "Edd China, the mechanical genius Wheeler Dealers‘ beloved mechanic, is leaving the show after 13 years because its new producers apparently want to dumb it down. Replacing him alongside Mike Brewer will be Ant Anstead, who we also like, and who could be a better fit for the changing format.\n\nLovable mechanic Edd’s workshop sequences are famous for their detail, technical accuracy and genuinely enjoyable watchability, but because they’re time-consuming and therefore expensive to film, the new production company, Velocity, wants to cut them down and simplify them.\n\nEdd released a statement via YouTube in the clip at the top. He claims the producers found it ‘too difficult to make’ in its current format, but isn’t willing to stand for the dumbing-down that Velocity wants to introduce.\n\nAs part of his decision to quit, he said:\n\n“Unfortunately, on Velocity’s first attempt at producing the show they found Wheeler Dealers “too difficult to make”, “at least in its current format.”\n\n“In particular, the detailed and in depth coverage of my fixes in the workshop; what I consider to be the backbone and USP of the programme, are something Velocity feel should be reduced. The workshop jobs are certainly the hardest part of the show to make and reducing their substance and role in the show will save the production considerable time, effort and therefore money.\n\n“However, this new direction is not something I am comfortable with as I feel the corners I was being asked to cut compromised the quality of my work and would erode my integrity as well as that of the show, so I have come to the conclusion that my only option is to let Velocity get on with it, without me.”\n\nWe have huge respect for Edd’s decision, and we know many of you will as well. He has too much respect for his own work to let this slide, and we don’t blame him one bit. We’re looking forward to whatever he does next."
