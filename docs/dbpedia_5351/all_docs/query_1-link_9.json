        "text": "The world is littered with the decaying uni-body's of former muscle cars, but at Graveyard Carz, no classic Mopar is too rusted for it to not get restored. These blue-collar technicians live by the motto: it's Mopar or it's No Car.\n\nThese guys only deal with Mopar cars, but they do factory restorations. Funny people ( If you like their special kind of humor).\n\nYou can get a little tired of the constand plugging of free stuff they get.\n\nMobsteel is based in Detroit, Michigan. Adam and his wife Pam own the company. The shows follow an update to a client's car to be faster and better looking than when it rolled off of a production line. They make unique, sharp looking replacement wheels themselves. The talented fabricators, mechanics, and painting staff are fun to watch as they work on each car.\n\nAs a former test pilot, Dan Short hopes that FantomWorks will become a classic car restoration shop that runs with military precision. Instead, he is finding out that when making old cars 'better than new' - nothing goes according to plan.\n\nAlot of nice cars on this show. Unfortunately they show you almost nothing from the car restoration, just the final result. A lot of bikes too which im not really into. Does feel scripted at times.\n\nThe McClure family is passionately restoring American glory, one classic car at a time. Their family business, Desert Valley Auto Parts, houses over 10,000 rust-free vehicles over 100 sun-baked Arizona acres. Not content with merely providing original parts for thousands of car collectors and restoration junkies each year, the McClures and their rag-tag crew are constantly on the hunt for cars to restore -- seeking them out in backyards, barns and even on their own massive lot. Their goal? To restore these classic American cars to their original glory and get them back on the road, while discovering the unique and historically significant qualities of each car -- and of course, to make a fair profit at auction.\n\nWelder Up's Steve Darnell and his band of oddballs and misfits are the Picassos of automotive fabricators. They work out of a sprawling garage on the outskirts of the Las Vegas Strip - stripping and re-building one-of-a-kind Mad Max-style VEGAS RAT RODS for quirky customers out of hidden treasure.\n\nThere's undiscovered treasure in the bayous of Louisiana and Charles Handler knows how to find it. From a 1957 Chevy Bel Air convertible to a 1967 Shelby Mustang GT, Handler and his team turn long-forgotten piles of junk into dazzling custom cars. He searches all over Louisiana for one-of-a-kind classics, invests his own money to fix them up, and then sells them at auction. These treasures can sell for big money, so there's huge profit to be made if everything goes according to plan.\n\nThis could be the last chance for car guru Rick Dore and ex WWE wrestler Chuck Palumbo to rebuild the lives of the hoarders they work for, and to find the type of success that eluded them the last time out. Whether transforming a 1936 Ford Coupe for an almond farmer, or customizing a 1937 Zephr for a demanding millionaire, renovating cars for hoarders is a risky proposition."
