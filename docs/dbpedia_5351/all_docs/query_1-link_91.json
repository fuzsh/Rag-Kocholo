        "text": "This is episode number thirteen. I hope this is our lucky episode. Number thirteen is a lucky number for me. My guest is a very special guest, someone that I’ve been following for a while, someone that invited me to his own podcast. It's a pleasure for me to introduce Mike Brewer. Mike is the Chief Operating Officer for RADCO Companies. Welcome to the show, Mike.\n\nAdrian, thank you for having me. It's such a pleasure.\n\nMike, for the very few people that don't know who you are, why don't you start by introducing yourself to our audience and maybe give us a little bit about your background? You're a Chief Operating Officer. That's a very high position in an organization. Many people are looking at those positions and it's hard for them to picture, \"How could I get from where I'm at now into an executive position or into a corporate-level position?\" Maybe your story would help them be able to picture in their head or see and build a path and imagine how they could get there. I think that would be very helpful.\n\nI'll try to practice in as abbreviated fashion as I can, but it's important to set some context. I was born into a difficult circumstance as a child. I grew up in a broken home that was full of mental health challenges from one of my parents' step-parents. I feel like that start in life was a little bit difficult, but it was also an incredible theme for me that taught me perseverance, grit, patience, and all those things that would be part of one's character in order to be successful in life.\n\nThat's not to suggest that I lived a perfect life up to this point in time. I certainly learned a lot of lessons the hard way. If I fast forward, I went to college at Texas Tech University on a basketball scholarship. I ended up dropping out of college about my third year in because some of those things from my childhood started to manifest themselves in the way of a depression in other areas of life. It became very challenging.\n\nI dropped out of college and went to work at a single-family real estate company called RE/MAX Town and Country. RE/MAX is a national brand, but I started selling single-family homes right out of college or dropping out of college. I went into doing that. I met an incredible man who became a mentor of mine. It allowed me the opportunity to not only sell single-family homes but start to invest in them.\n\nI got my teeth cut in the property management business by buying little houses. In my hometown, a house costs around $10,000. If you can imagine my first house, I didn't pay $10,000 for it. It was financed by the owner. Long story short, I learned about real estate from the foundation up. I was the guy fixing the broken toilet. I laid my own carpet. I had a knee stretcher. I had all the tools to do that. I worked on water heaters. I did everything on the service side of the business to manage my little portfolio of real estate.\n\nI then decided to go back to college and ended up getting a leasing consultant job in what we would know as a traditional property management company. I quickly graduated from leasing consultant to assistant manager to property manager to district manager. Frankly, I didn't have a clue what I was doing along the way. I knew how to work hard. I was the first guy at the office in the morning. I was the last person to leave at night. I had an unquenchable thirst for knowledge, and I had a curiosity that never quit. I wanted to know how everything worked from the little sensor in the gutter that told the sprinkler system not to turn on when it was raining to everything that happened on the property.\n\nThat being said, I did that for a couple of years in Lubbock, Texas before moving to a nationally recognized brand called Equity Residential. I went to work there as a property manager, actually a general manager at the time. I decided that I wanted to aim for a higher level of responsibility. The way I decided to do that was I looked at this report. Equity published a thing called the ROR, and it came out every Monday morning. It told the entire company where every single property in the entire organization sat in terms of occupancy and rental income, etc. I would literally look down the list of properties and see where the most challenging asset was. I took it upon myself to figure out how I could position myself into those tough assets.\n\nPretty soon, you become known as the person who can fix problems. You start getting sent around to fix problems. That education in and of itself and fixing all those problems is what advanced me to where I am now. It wasn't because I went to work in the class-A high-rise luxury apartment community. They have their own problems, but it wasn't because I did that. It's because I went to the very challenging properties and figured out how to fix them, not by myself, but with great teams. That's how I ultimately advanced into the position I am in now. It’s hard work, grit, and a little bit of patience.\n\nI want to pick up on something that you mentioned at the beginning, the challenges that you have to overcome in life. It's important for the audience to know your take. What resources helped you overcome the difficult situations in your life? What gave you this type of mindset of, “I’m going to have to be the person that is willing or is volunteering for doing the jobs that nobody else wants to do?” Those are very important points for our conversation.\n\nI would go back to my childhood. When I grew up in this broken home, it was a fight for survival. It baked into my mind that the only way to get out of a difficult situation was to work, be it physical work or using your mind to work, being resourceful and being creative. It was almost a natural thing for me to look for difficult situations because I grew up in a difficult situation. It was a little bit of familiarity for me to go to a place that had difficulty. It was baked into me to work hard at it because that was the path to freedom or getting out of it. I chalk it up to shifting my mindset from what could otherwise have been a very easy thing to call myself a victim and potentially fall off into victimhood.\n\nI wanted better for my life. I saw all around me the fruits of real estate, especially in the way of my mentor. My mentor was the catalyst for me. I saw all the fruits of his labors in the way of being able to live in a nice home, not an overly expensive house, but a nice home, driving a nice car and interacting with nice people. I thought, \"I can do that. It's going to take a little more time for me probably, and I'm going to have to work hard at it, but I'd like to have some of those fruits of life.\" As a mindset shifts for me, probably the catalyst was the mentor that was in my life at the time. It still is to this day.\n\nOne other thing that I want to hop on was you mentioned Equity has a report that was presented weekly. They had everything you wanted to know about an asset and how the asset performs. This brings me to my next question. How important are KPIs in helping an organization become a top organization, grow and become very successful? What's the importance of having KPIs?\n\nThere are a handful of things that are very important to a successful outcome. KPIs are a piece of that. Somebody taught me a long time ago, you have to measure what you want. If you don't measure it, you're not going to get it. That's where a KPI comes into play in my head. There are downsides to KPIs and especially in the last 3 to 5 years, plus or minus win, where big data has entered the equation. We're able to harvest data from sensors and all kinds of other inputs. We can get all kinds of data and we can put it in a big data farm or data lake, and we extrapolate it out. We can get nuanced to no end. That's dangerous because, in my mind, there are 8 to 10 key drivers of real estate.\n\nThere are 8 to 10 key measures that you need to pay attention to. Maybe there are a few subsets to each one of those parent KPIs, but if you get beyond that and you're trying to measure what water flow is on a Tuesday at 4:00 in the afternoon when people come home from work. I don't know the value of that. At some point, you've overdone it and it gets you to the downside. The incremental change you're going to see out of that is not important. It's not important enough, at least in my head. Pay attention to the fundamentals of our business, and you'll be quite successful.\n\nMike, behind you is an impressive library. I’m seeing that library every time I’m watching one of your videos. You do most of your videos from the library. I’d like for you to share with the audience a couple of books that influenced you in a big way. They are maybe a few books that influenced you from a professional perspective, and a few books that influenced you in life in general or your way of thinking that was a game-changer for you.\n\nThere are definitely a few I would share. I always start with the Bible. It is the most important and amazing piece of literature on the planet. It's something that I spend time on every single morning. It's the best SOP for life. I believe that a lot of literature, including a lot of business literature, is born out of the Bible. Some of the books that have influenced that are germane to that, one is a book called The Choice by Og Mandino. It’s a very short book, about 100 pages.\n\nVery quick story. I was doing an open house for one of my very first single-family home sales for RE/MAX. I walked into the house and it was an occupied home. Laying on the kitchen counter was a book called The Choice by Og Mandino. My open house didn't yield one person. Not one person walked into my open house that day, but I read the entire book because I didn't have anything else to do. It impacted me such that at the end of the book, I was literally crying. I had real tears in my eyes at what the book was communicating. I read every single Og Mandino book that I could get my hands on from that point, which gave way to things like Think and Grow Rich by Napoleon Hill and As A Man Thinketh by James Allen.\n\nI got deep into spiritual literature, business literature, philosophy and stoic philosophy, and things of that nature as they evolved over time. For the price of a couple of cups of coffee, you can get more wisdom in an afternoon than you can by watching mindless television. I advocate books all day long. There's so much you can get out of them.\n\nIt's also an opportunity to gain a lifetime's worth of experience within a few hours. Some of the books are distilling someone's lifetime experience. If you read a book, you could possibly live through that book someone's life experience. I don't know how many things are more powerful than that.\n\nIt's an abbreviated version of what somebody took 40 or 50 years to learn. You can save yourself the time and the mistakes that you might otherwise make in the course of two hours. It's important to save for whatever this is worth. Many people have said this to me and I believe it. It's been hard for me, but sometimes you have to put the books down. You have to go to work because you can get caught up in procrastinating. You can learn a lot. You can put a lot in here, but it doesn't mean anything until you start putting it into practice.\n\nIf you've created a culture and an ecosystem that enriches people, supports people, celebrates them and picks them up when they've been beaten up by life, then you're not going to be a subject to or a part of the Great Resignation as much as other people are. Even if they wake up and they decide, “I don't want to do this anymore,” they're going to give you everything they have until they move on to do something else. I don't know. I have a love-hate relationship with this idea of the Great Resignation.\n\nIt's also a great opportunity for us as employees. To look at what's around us and how much we could gain from the situation, in a way, possibilities are pretty much endless. For us as employers, it’s to say, “What are we going to do going forward to maybe retain people?” First, everybody is now focusing on how we get talent. You still have some talent left. It's not like you're by yourself.\n\nLet's start by focusing on the existing talent, and see what we can do for existing talent. We're seeing sign-on bonuses. I’m not against that by any means. I’m all for all of the above. Any type of incentives that you could provide to get great talent, I’m all for it. At the same time, if you're offering so much more people from outside of the organization to come join you, and you are not spending the same significant effort to keep your existing talent, this might have a boomerang effect. While you are chasing talent, then your existing talent is rushing towards the back door. It becomes a never-ending cycle.\n\nThis is one of the things that don't maybe show in surveys. I’ve done a few surveys on LinkedIn and the number one choice for people to switch jobs nowadays is pay. This comes up at the highest percentage in the post that I’m doing. There's definitely a very big incentive for people to change jobs for pay, but then something that doesn't show as much as it matters to people is doing meaningful work. Would you like to weigh in on that, Mike? I’d like to hear your opinion on it.\n\nBoth things you said there are true. Wage inflation is something that could have happened a long time ago, not only for your internal employees. Certainly, it’s first and foremost, but as we compete out in the marketplace, it's been too long waiting. I’m very happy for people as long as the business can sustain that type of pay to our team members. There are a lot of team members out there that absolutely deserve that and probably have been waiting for that for a long time.\n\nDoing meaningful work, even though pay probably yields as the top choice in your survey results, if people were searched down deep, doing meaningful work is more important than pay. Pay is important, but being a part of something bigger than self, and being part of the vision or a mission or a company that has a value system that aligns with your value system makes it more exciting to get out of bed in the morning, and go and spend time with those people.\n\nThose people are of like mind. They care and they want to do good work in the community, not solo. What better place than the multifamily space to do meaningful work? I’m not the first person to say this, but we provide homes for people. One of the fundamental building blocks of being in the world is shelter. It's in the hierarchy of needs. Shelter is up there with water. It's so important. What better place to be than to be in the multifamily space doing meaningful work? You can wake up every day knowing you're going to do some meaningful work because you were providing a home for someone."
