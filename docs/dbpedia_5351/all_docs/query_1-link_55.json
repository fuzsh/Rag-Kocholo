        "text": "In the world of automotive television, there’s one show that’s been stealing the hearts of enthusiasts for years – “Wheeler Dealers.” Hosted by the dynamic duo of Mike Brewer and Elvis (Marc Priestley), this show has been a beacon of hope for classic car lovers. In the 18th season, they set their sights on a true gem – the Saab 900 Convertible. In this article, we’ll delve into the captivating world of Saab and the thrilling episode where Mike and Elvis bring this classic back to life.\n\nA Nostalgic Journey\n\nSaab, the Swedish automaker known for producing innovative and quirky cars, left an indelible mark on the automotive industry. Enthusiasts around the world fondly remember their unique designs, aircraft-inspired origins, and turbocharged performance. In a world where cookie-cutter cars dominate the roads, there’s a longing for the Saab marque’s return. “Wheeler Dealers” seized the opportunity to celebrate these fantastic cars by taking on the sought-after Saab 900 Convertible.\n\nA Bargain with Potential\n\nThe Saab 900 Convertible featured in the episode had all the makings of a great classic car. Priced at just £6,500, it seemed like a bargain. The electrically-operated roof worked like a charm, and the overall condition was original. However, there were some issues lurking beneath the surface. The engine didn’t run smoothly, the clutch made unsettling noises, and the steering left much to be desired.\n\nUnder the Hood\n\nThe first task at hand was to address the rough running of the engine. For a mere £30, Mike and Elvis overhauled the ignition system, replacing spark plugs, distributor cap, and HT leads. This small investment transformed the engine’s performance, smoothing out its rough edges.\n\nBut the real challenge lay in addressing the lack of power. The solution? Removing the turbocharger and seeking the expertise of Turbo Technics in Northamptonshire. Mike met with a seasoned professional who had a hand in developing turbo installations for Saab, and a thorough examination of the turbo revealed corroded parts and cracks in the housing around the wastegate. An overhaul was in order, with new parts and a larger, lighter impeller that promised improved response and power – all for a modest cost of £300.\n\nWoolly Steering Woes\n\nThe Saab 900’s issues didn’t stop there. Elvis uncovered a disconcerting oil leak from the steering rack. The solution required replacing the steering rack, a fiddly task but crucial for restoring precise steering. With some pipework and the swap of track rod ends, the new unit was soon in place, and the convertible felt precise and responsive once more.\n\nThe Finishing Touches\n\nBefore declaring the project complete, there was one more task under the bonnet – renewing the cabin air filter, an inexpensive fix at just £19. In the aesthetics department, Mike found a set of original 3-spoke alloy wheels for a mere £250. With those wheels bolted on, the transformation was nearly complete.\n\nCounting the Cost and Turning a Profit\n\nThe grand total for the Saab 900 Convertible project was £7,489. But with a car in such fantastic condition, turning a healthy profit was all but guaranteed. A test drive was in order, and Elvis headed to an airfield, where he was met by Mike, who arrived in a Saab plane, adding a dash of flair to the occasion.\n\nThe Saab 900 Convertible performed splendidly, and the day concluded with a gathering of other Saabs – from cars to buses and trucks. The potential owner, Theo, was more than happy to pay £8,400, sealing the deal on this superb classic drop-top.\n\nA Personal Touch from Mike Brewer\n\nThe “Wheeler Dealers” host, Mike Brewer, found immense joy in rescuing classic cars like the Saab 900 Convertible. For him, the experience went beyond restoring cars. It was about celebrating a once-historic marque known for producing more than just great cars. Saab’s legacy extended to the skies with their aircraft, and Mike even had the opportunity to take a ride in a 1962 vintage Saab airplane. The project was undoubtedly a labor of love, and Mike expressed his hopes for the Saab brand to someday make a triumphant return.\n\nDon’t Miss the Saab Resurrection\n\nThe “Wheeler Dealers” team’s adventure with the Saab 900 Convertible exemplifies their commitment to reviving classic cars, one gem at a time. In the world of automotive restoration, their enthusiasm and expertise shine bright. With an old Saab airplane adding a touch of nostalgia, their journey was a memorable one. And as the Saab 900 Convertible found its new owner, it reinforced the timeless appeal of classic cars, leaving us all yearning for a renaissance of the Saab brand."
