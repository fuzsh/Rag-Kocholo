        "text": "The Tesla Model 3 is said to be one of the best electric vehicles around, but what do you do if its look isn’t quite what you’d want from a high performance car?\n\nWheeler Dealer‘s Marc ‘Elvis’ Priestley gives us the lowdown on his new Tesla Model 3 body kit from Startech….\n\nAs you might imagine, I’m an enormous fan of the internal combustion engine. I love a noisy, fast, gas guzzling car as much as anyone else, but… I’m also a huge fan of technology.\n\nBack in 2014 I was asked to join the presentation team for ITV’s coverage of the brand-new FIA Formula E electric car racing championship… and so began my obsession with the ultrafast performance of electric cars.\n\nOver the next few years I was fortunate enough to borrow and test drive a number of amazing electric vehicles from many manufacturers, but in the end none have yet matched up to the performance and technology on board a Tesla. When combined with the superior charging network the brand’s introduced, Tesla cars are still by far the best EV choice for those who can afford them in my opinion.\n\nRecently, I’ve been lucky enough to buy one of my own and I haven’t been disappointed with the experience other than in one area. The styling. The car does 0-60 in about 3 seconds, the gadgets it comes with are brilliant and it’s one of the safest cars on the road. Those features are all best in class, yet the way the car looks just doesn’t match and so lets it down for me.\n\nThat’s where Startech come in. The German sister company to Brabus have created an aftermarket body kit for the Model 3, as well as other cars, and it seemed like the answer to my troubles.\n\nThis week I fitted the new front and rear bumpers to the car and it’s been transformed.\n\nNot only is the kit well made from ABS plastic, the same as the OEM parts, but it fits even better than the OEM parts it’s replacing did in the first place.\n\nAt around €3000 for the pair of bumpers, I personally think it’s a welcome addition that’s worth the extra spend and finally makes the car look the way it always should’ve done.\n\nCheck out the video to see how they went on.\n\nFind more info:\n\nStartech\n\nTesla\n\nIf you found this article of interest, you may also enjoy…\n\nWheeler Dealers take on a high mileage modern classic\n\nZytek reveals concept electric classic race car\n\n‘Old out ya hand!
