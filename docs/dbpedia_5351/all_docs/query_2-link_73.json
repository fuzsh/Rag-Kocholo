        "text": "The presenters of Wheeler Dealers have issued a plea to track down a classic car after cruel thieves stuck outside their hotel.\n\nMike Brewer and Marc Priestley are desperate for help after they woke to find the vehicle gone.\n\nThey now want to find the 1979 Mk 1 Ford Fiesta 1300S, went missing overnight on Monday.\n\nThe television stars have appealed for help after the the motor was taken outside Premier Inn, Pontefract, West Yorkshire, ahead of a car show in nearby Sherburn.\n\nThe popular programme, which airs on the Discovery channel, follows the pair in their quest to restored old cars before selling them on for profit.\n\nMike and Marc appeared in a video on twitter asking the public to help them find the car.\n\n\"This has been a nuts and bolts restoration,\" Mike said.\n\n\"I dare to say that we've possibly built the best Mk1 Ford Fiesta in this country - it really is this good.\"\n\nMarch went on: \"We are heartbroken and it's a car that deserves to be out there for the world to see, not squirrelled away on the back of some thief's trailer.\"\n\nThe Ford Fiesta MK1 was the first generation of the Ford Fiesta supermini and Ford Europe's first multi-national front-wheel-drive car.\n\nThe vehicle was in a covered trailer when it was taken from outside the hotel on Knottingly Road, Pontefract.\n\nIt was supposed to be shown at car festival The Motorist, which sees 500 cars gathered from across the country so car enthusiasts can enjoy them.\n\nIn a post on Tuesday, Mike urged broadcasters and the public to help by sharing the clip, writing: \"We have had our star car STOLEN on the biggest ever #wheelerdealers day !! Please help and RT.\"\n\nHe's asked fans to share snaps of the car, calling it their \"stolen pride and joy.\"\n\nWheeler Dealers first aired in 2003 and sees car lovers save old and beloved vehicles.\n\n* Follow Mirror Celebs onSnapchat,Instagram,Twitter andFacebook."
