        "text": "Praise the television gods because Edd China is planning a new show, and yes it's all about restoring old cars.\n\nCalled “Edd China's Garage Revival,” the show is only at the pilot stage but with any luck we'll soon see a television or online channel pick it up. The full 40-minute pilot will air on the Edd China's Garage Revival YouTube channel on May 1.\n\nLike us, we're sure you were saddened to learn last year that China had left his original show, “Wheeler Dealers,” because of creative differences with new producer Discovery, which aired the show on Velocity. Basically, China, the ever-pragmatic mechanic of the show, wasn't keen on Discovery's desire to skip the nitty-gritty details in order to appeal to a more general audience.\n\nHe called it quits after 13-long seasons and Ant Anstead, a fellow mechanic and car show personality from the United Kingdom, stepped in to join Mike Brewer, the dealer component of “Wheeler Dealers.” The show aired its 14th season last year.\n\nChina has spent the past 12 months enjoying some well-deserved time off. However he's also been working on putting together the elements for his new show. This time around he'll travel abroard to meet owners of project cars that have gone nowhere, and then help them complete the build.\n\nFor the pilot episode China travels to Norway to meet with the owner of a Mk1 Volkswagen Golf GTI. He then works with the owner to restore the car, explaining things along the way in his typical relaxed manner that always leaves you with the impression that perhaps tinkering with your own car is a worth a try."
