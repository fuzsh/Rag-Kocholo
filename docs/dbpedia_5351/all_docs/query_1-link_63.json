        "text": "Back in April, the CamperKing social team were delighted to receive an out-of-the-blue Direct Message from the Wheeler Dealer himself, Mike Brewer. Mike was looking to convert his LWB VW T6.1 into a cool campervan, and of course, we were happy to help. Three months on, and we have now presented Mike with the finished product, a CamperKing Monte Carlo. Over to Mike, to tell the story in his own words...\n\nAnyone who knows me would know that I have a really keen interest in the freedom a vehicle can give you. Cars, bikes, vans etc. are like time machines. Start off in one place and end up somewhere else. Maybe an old hangout or somewhere new? I love that.\n\nAlso, for a long time, I hankered after a suitable home on wheels so I can do just that, explore! Wheeler Dealer fans may remember Colin the Camper, the 1962 Bedford Dormobile that we converted on the show back in 2021. I had use of that van after I sold it on the show and thought it was great. However. the practicality of a wheezy '62 Bedford made long journeys more tiring, so ever since I’ve kept one eye on the market to see what could come next.\n\nThat opportunity arose when one of the directors I work with, Jon, had mistakenly bought a VW T6.1 LWB 3.2 4Motion DSG, a pimped and lowered van that was almost new, without telling the boss at home! So after some careful negotiation, the van was ours!\n\nNow we have a great van, so what do we do with it? Well anyone who understands the camper conversion market will know that there’s only one real go-to place for conversions. The appropriately named CamperKing!\n\nSpencer and his team at CamperKing have an envious reputation in the campervan industry and it's easy to see why. When you visit their headquarters just outside of Banbury, you step into a showroom that has you immersed into a world of exploration and freedom that makes the journey even more exciting.\n\nSee Mike first visiting CamperKing HQ\n\nMy wife, Michelle and I spent hours deciding on what would be best for our van. It needed to be a camper, a production office, a podcast studio, and sometimes just a day van. Spencer, who let’s face it knows more of this world than most, walked us around the myriad of options in the showroom to get to a point where we had the basics. Though, the real decisions had to come from the experts, and we are so pleased we let them guide us!\n\nOur van is EPIC.. it has enough space for podcasting, camping, and for use as a film location hub, our van has the lot! From its superb Titan bed downstairs to its 2-bed loft apartment hidden under the pop-top, and everything in between. We have a fridge, microwave, burner, sink, and enough plug sockets to allow a production team to hook up in the back! We also adopted that go-anywhere stance with a lift kit and bigger off-road Dakar wheels and tyres, so know we can tackle any terrain, and get to wherever we need to be.\n\nThe van's paintwork is that very popular dark grey, so Spencer and the team went for a gloss black carbon fibre finish that looks the part to complement it. And with the Overwatch small square stitched leather swivel seat, and the equally impressive single passenger seat, it is the envy of everyone that sees it.\n\nWatch Mike reveal his campervan for the first time\n\nMichelle and I are thoroughly overwhelmed with the service and the quality of this conversion, so much so I’ve personally asked to become a proud ambassador for CamperKing, as I want everyone to see that British craftsmen and women are doing amazing things in the UK.\n\nI’m very proud that I now have the opportunity to show off our van at events throughout the UK, and I can't wait for all of you to see it in person!"
