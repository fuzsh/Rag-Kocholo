From his car-focused career to his fortune - here's what you need to know about the television presenter and motor specialist.\n\nWho is Wheeler Dealers’ Ant Anstead?\n\nAnt Anstead was born in Plymouth, Devon, in March 1979.\n\nHe is an English television presenter, motor specialist, car builder, designer, and artist.\n\nPrior to following his automotive dreams, Anstead joined the police force in 1999, aged 18.\n\nIn 2003, he was appointed one of the youngest Tactical Firearms Team officers in UK history, receiving two commendations for acts of bravery.\n\nFollowing this, Anstead resigned from the police to pursue a career as a car builder, at the same time forging a successful television career.\n\nAs a presenter, the car expert is best known for co-presenting the Channel 4 automotive show For the Love of Cars - a role he first took on in 2014.\n\nOff screen, Anstead has accomplished various notable achievements including nine World Records for car builds.\n\nHe also built the world’s largest Airfix auto model, which was featured in a 2011 Ripley’s Believe it or Not book.\n\nWhere is Ant Anstead now?\n\nAccording to his official website, Anstead now resides in the US.\n\nIn September 2023, the star revealed details about a new TV show which will document Radford’s stunning Pikes Peak win.\n\nDuring an interview with Express.co.uk, Anstead admitted a camera team had captured the epic mountain climb with the show expected to air in 2024.\n\nAway from his TV ventures, Anstead is in a relationship with Bridget Jones star Renee Zellweger.\n\nIn July 2023, it was reported that the Hollywood actress told close pals that she and Ant were tying the knot following a low-key engagement.\n\nA friend said: “Renee and Ant are keeping their plans incredibly private, they’re not planning a big public announcement.\n\n“She has been telling her inner circle about organising their nuptials, everything will be very low-key.\n\n“Her relationship with Ant is super strong and they’re madly in love, and they can’t wait to get hitched.”\n\nRenee and TV presenter Ant, who has been wed twice before and is a dad of three, began dating in September 2021.\n\nWhat is Ant Anstead's net worth?\n\nAccording to wealth website Celebrity Net Worth, Anstead has an estimated net worth of $5 million (£3,957,650.00).\n\nThis sum is thanks to his success as a presenter, which has resulted in him becoming a household name among car enthusiasts.\n\nWhat other shows has Ant Anstead presented?\n\nAside from his role as a co-presenter on For the Love of Cars, Ant has also starred on a number of popular programmes - one of which was Wheeler Dealers.\n\nIn 2017, Anstead replaced Edd China as co-host on Wheeler Dealers and became the new master mechanic alongside trader Mike Brewer in the Discovery Channel restoration show.\n\n\"I keep asking 'what is the catch?' I get paid to work on cars. It's an incredible privilege to do what you love.\"\n\nAnt Anstead\n\nAt the time of landing the role, the presenter said: \"I've always had a car project on the go - so if you can make your hobby a job you've cracked it.\n\n\"I keep asking 'what is the catch?' I get paid to work on cars. It's an incredible privilege to do what you love.\"\n\nAside from Wheeler Dealers, Anstead has also presented a number of other shows including, World's Most Expensive Cars, Ant Anstead Master Mechanic, Sky's World's Greatest Cars and Discovery's Celebrity IOU: Joyride.\n\nOther titles he has presented include, Christina on the Coast, Britain's Greatest Invention, The Lost Lotus: Restoring a Race Car, Barrett-Jackson Live Auto Auction and Building Cars Live."
