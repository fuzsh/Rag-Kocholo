        "text": "Vicki Butler Henderson was born into a racing family, so you could say the sport is in her blood. Her brother is a racing driver, her father was in the British karting team, and her grandfather used to race a Frazer Nash.\n\nShe first took up racing aged 12, racing karts against legends like David Coulthard. Her career started as a racing instructor at Silverstone Circuit, then combined this with journalism, working on magazines such as Performance Car and Max Power.\n\nHer love for the sport saw her in high demand for automotive programmes. She joined Top Gear in 1994 until its original cancellation in 2001, moving to Channel 5 to work on Fifth Gear.\n\nHer other presenting credits include The One Show (2009-17) and GMTV. She has also been a television critic for The Big Breakfast, presented items for Countryfile and hosted segments for This Morning. She has worked as the main or co-presenter for shows including Wrecks to Riches (2006), Date My Daughter (2005), Formula Woman (2006), and The Biggest Loser (2005-06). She has also presented the coverage of the British Touring Car Championship, The Power Boat Championship, and the Farnborough Air Show.\n\nShe has also presented non-motoring related shows on the radio, for Virgin Radio and Absolute Radio’s breakfast shows, XFM’s Christian O’Connell Breakfast Show and Radio 2’s Steve Wright in the Afternoon.\n\nIn 2010, Vicki published her first book Vicki Butler-Henderson’s 100 Sexiest Cars, where she reviewed her all-time favourite 100 motorcars. Since 2020, Vicki has hosted The Auto Express Podcast in connection with the magazine of the same name. She has welcomed guests including Mark Webber, Jay Leno, Nick Mason, Sir Chris Hoy, Mike Brewer, Tiff Needell, Elfyn Evans, DJ Carl Cox, and Jason Plato, to name a few, where they discuss the latest car reviews and behind-the-scenes titbits from the automotive industry.\n\nCORPORATE\n\nAs well as her presenting gigs, Vicki has recorded voiceovers for, and starred in, advertisements for companies including Sony Centres, Wrigleys Extra, PlayStation 2, Kent & Medway Safety Camera Partnership, and Toyota.\n\nVicki is an experienced event host, award ceremony presenter, and interviewer, having interviewed the likes of Lewis Hamilton and Jenson Button. She has worked for major car manufacturers such as Bentley, Scuderia Ferrari, and Mustang. Other clients include O2, Bosch, the Co-Op, Petronas, Royal Mail and Vodafone.\n\nVicki became the first female to win a Maserati race in the history of the marque in 2004, finished with two podium places in the 2009 GT Cup racing a Ferrari 430, and top ten finishes in the 2016-2019 Mini Challenge.\n\nUnsurprisingly, she has owned many impressive and collectable cars, including a Honda S2000, Mk II Golf GTI, Ford Ranger (T6) Raptor, and a Ducati Monster 750.\n\nCall +44 1753 439 289 or email Great British Speakers now to book automotive presenter, speaker and host Vicki Butler Henderson for your corporate event."
