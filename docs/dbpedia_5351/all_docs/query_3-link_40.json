        "text": "Dan Prosser and Andrew Frankel are joined by Wheelers Dealer frontman Mike Brewer. The car trader turned television presenter created the show more than 20 years ago, and since then it's become the world's biggest and longest running car TV show. On Wheeler Dealers, Mike and his master mechanic buy a desirable old car in need of restoration and rebuild it from top to bottom to try and turn a profit. Across almost 300 episodes, Mike has bought and sold classics, hatchbacks, sports cars, supercars, luxury cars and more, and now he's taking Wheeler Dealers around the world.\n\nIn this episode he explains why the show is so popular, as well as talking about his past as a car dealer. He also reveals which cars he has at home, including his collection of old Porsches.\n\nThe best writers, the finest stories and no ads, all on The Intercooler’s beautiful online car magazine.
