        "text": "The 2020 motoring events calendar was almost totally wiped out by the coronavirus pandemic. However, 2021 has shaped up to be a classic year for car enthusiasts, with a huge number of motoring events to attend.\n\nWe’ve researched some of the UK’s biggest and best car shows and motorsport events, making sure we include something for everyone.\n\nHowever, as last year taught us, everything is subject to change, and sadly, some shows are cancelled for 2021 too. Here, though, are the events currently confirmed to be going ahead.\n\n2021 MOTORING EVENTS GUIDE\n\nClassic Motor Show – 12-14 November\n\nThe Classic Motor Show is a good way to end the show calendar. A chance to chat with like-minded enthusiasts before prized classics are put into winter hibernation. The NEC is your destination for this annual classic car curtain call.\n\nLook out for updates and details of new events over the coming weeks and months.\n\nCANCELLED FOR 2021\n\nAuto Royale – 16-18 July\n\nAuto Royale 2020 was billed as a “true ‘festivalised’ event which will attract the very affluent and high net worth collectors along with ABC1 owners and enthusiasts of the automotive lifestyle.” That was before it was postponed until 2021… and sadly, despite a move from Althorp to Waddesdon Manor in Buckinghamshire, it has now been postponed indefinitely.\n\nEvents you’ve missed\n\nHere are the events that have been and gone in 2021. If you like the sound of them, keep an eye out for 2022 dates!\n\nSimply Electric – 23 May\n\nBeaulieu’s 2021 events calendar sparks into life with Simply Electric. It’s the first of 15 ‘Simply’ events scheduled to take place this year, with a range of electric and plug-in hybrid vehicles on display in May. Visit the Beaulieu website for details of this and other events.\n\nRetro Rides Weekender – 29-30 May\n\nFans of pre-1998 cars will be converging on Goodwood for the Retro Rides Weekender. Retro parking, club displays and track time are the order of the day for this popular event.\n\nMasters Historic Festival – 29-30 May\n\nHead to Brands Hatch for two days of historic touring cars, endurance legends, historic F1 and sports cars, plus pre-1966 Minis.\n\nJune Scramble – 5-6 June\n\nSummer 2021 sees the return of the hugely popular Sunday Scramble at Bicester Heritage. The first-ever two-day Scramble will be held on 5 and 6 June 2021.\n\nHaynes Breakfast Club – 6 June\n\nThe Haynes Breakfast Club is back! If you missed out on the two events in May, be sure to book early for events in June, July, August, September, October, November and December. Future classics (post-1980) are welcome on the first Sunday of every month, while pre-1980 cars are invited to the second Sunday. Booking is essential.\n\nLondon Concours – 8-10 June\n\nNew for 2021, London Concours is introducing a third day, creating three different themes: VIP Preview Day, Style Edition Day and Supercar Day. Expect champagne receptions, the world’s most exotic sports cars and the sharpest suits and dresses.\n\nLand Rover Legends and Thruxton Historic – 12-13 June\n\nFollowing its postponement in 2020, Land Rover Legends will take place at Thruxton on 12-13 June. You can expect feature displays, the leading Land Rover clubs and awards for the best vehicles. Advance tickets are available, although children under the age of 16 are free and do not need a ticket. The event coincides with the Thruxton Historic.\n\nE-Type 60 – 12-13 June\n\nThere are many events at Shelsley Walsh in 2021, but E-Type 60 is likely to be one of the best. All 13 versions of the Jaguar E-Type will be on display, including one of the original press cars.\n\nBTCC Snetterton – 12-13 June\n\nThe BTCC calendar got underway at Thruxton in May, with BTC Racing’s Josh Cook claiming two victories. The next race is at Snetterton in June.\n\nYorkshire Motorsport Festival – 25-27 June\n\nFormer Top Gear presenter Julia Bradbury was due to be the host of the Yorkshire Motorsport Festival in 2020. The event will now take place in June 2021, albeit with crowds capped to 4,000, with the timetable including the first closed road hillclimb to be held in the North of England. Around 80 mainly pre-1986s cars will compete for the fastest time on a 0.8-mile track.\n\nLondon Classic Car Show – 25-27 June\n\nWith Covid-19 restrictions in mind, the London Classic Car Show is moving from Excel London to an outdoor event at Syon Park. The 2021 event will celebrate 135 years of the motor car, 1930s style and elegance, ‘80s Brutalism and contemporary supercars. The show will also showcase 60 years of the Jaguar E-Type.\n\nTruckfest Midlands – 3-4 July\n\nThere are eight Truckfest events in 2021, with the Three Counties Showground in Malvern playing host to the West Midlands event in July.\n\nGoodwood Festival of Speed – 8-11 July\n\nThe Goodwood Festival of Speed will return in July 2021, with the organisers promising to celebrate the 2020 theme of ‘The Maestros – Motorsport’s Great All-Rounders’. We understand this isn’t a celebration of the Austin Maestro.\n\nBritish Grand Prix – 16-18 July\n\nAll tickets for the British Grand Prix at Silverstone come with a Covid-19 guarantee. If spectators are not allowed at the event due to government guidelines, ticket holders will be able to transfer their ticket to 2022 or receive a full refund.\n\nCarfest North – 23-25 July\n\nCarfest North takes place at Bolesworth Castle in Cheshire.

Tickets for 2021 are sold out.\n\nBug Jam – 23-25 July\n\nBilled as “the original and best VW fest”, Bug Jam is certainly one of the best Volkswagen events in the UK. If you love Dubs, head to Santa Pod in July.\n\nMotoFest Coventry – 17 July – 8 August\n\nMotoFest Coventry is a free motoring event in the UK City of Culture 2021. It’s perhaps most famous for the ring road becoming a sprint circuit for the weekend. Also look out for Formula Gymkhana and the Autotest National Championship.\n\nSilverstone Classic – 30 July – 1 August\n\nThe Silverstone Classic is one of the highlights of the motoring calendar – a three-day, non-stop historic racing extravaganza. You can expect to see around 10,000 classic cars and live motor racing.\n\nFestival of the Unexceptional – 31 July\n\nOwners of unexceptional cars of the 1960s, ‘70s, ‘80s and ‘90s are invited to the Festival of the Unexceptional for a celebration of saloons, hatchbacks and estates. Grimsthorpe Castle in Lincolnshire is the new venue.\n\nShelsley Walsh Autojumble – 7 August\n\nNew for 2021, Shelsley Walsh is launching what it calls its first proper autojumble. The paddock garages will be full of spare parts, tools and ephemera, while the main field will play host to trade and private stands. Camping facilities will be available to traders.\n\nElectric Vehicles Festival – 7 August\n\nThe Electric Vehicles Festival celebrates its third year in 2021, running at the British Motor Museum in Gaydon on Saturday 7 August. Billed as a celebration of all things motoring electric, the event brings together both EV owners and those who are ‘EV-curious’. And a £40 family ticket for two adults and three children even includes entry to the British Motor Museum itself!\n\nFord Fair – 8 August\n\nEurope’s biggest Ford event is returning to Silverstone for its 36th year. Around 5,000 Fords are expected to attend, with tickets available from £27.\n\nRetro Carfest – 13-15 August\n\nThis new addition to the Carfest calendar will take place at Bicester Heritage in August.

Le Mans is less than three hours from the ferry terminals at Cherbourg, St-Malo and Le Havre.\n\nHistoric Rally Festival – 21-22 August\n\nA new event for 2021 sees Weston Park playing host to a celebration of Group B rally cars on former stages of the RAC Rally. Around 80 cars will take part in a demonstration run on the 1,000-acre estate.\n\nRetro Rides Gathering – 21 August\n\nThe Retro Rides Gathering is one of the best events for fans of retro and modified cars. Check out the Retro Rides Facebook page for more details.\n\nCarfest South – 27-29 August\n\nCarfest South takes place at Laverstoke Farm in Hampshire. It’s essentially a southern version of Carfest North, so you expect music, cars and family fun.

Now taking place at the end of August.\n\nSalon Prive – 1-5 September\n\nSalon Prive went ahead in 2020, despite restrictions that saw the majority of similar events postponed or cancelled. For 2021, the Concours d’Elegance will return to Blenheim Palace for the 16th consecutive edition. Around 1,000 supercars will take centre stage on the South Lawn, while Ladies’ Day plays host to the Boodles Best Hat Competition.\n\nConcours of Elegance – 3-5 September\n\nLike Salon Prive, the Concours of Elegance event at Hampton Court Palace went ahead in 2020. You can expect more of the same in 2021, when 300 of the world’s finest and rarest motor cars appear at the Palace. Full details to be announced.\n\nFully Charged Live – 3-5 September\n\nFully Charged Live was another victim of the pandemic in 2020. The good news for fans of electric cars is that the event is back for 2021, with Fully Charged Live moving to a new venue at Farnborough International. Ideal for anyone preparing for the 2030 ban on the sale of new petrol and diesel cars.\n\nInternational Autojumble – 4-5 September\n\nIf rummaging for oily car parts is your idea of a dirty weekend, the International Autojumble is the event for you. Some 2,000 stands are expected to fill the grounds of the Beaulieu Motor Museum, making it the biggest outdoor sale of motoring items this side of the Atlantic.\n\nJapfest – 4 September\n\nAround 4,000 cars are expected to converge on Silverstone for Europe’s biggest Japanese car show. Tickets are available from £27.\n\nGoodwood Revival – 17-19 September\n\nThe Goodwood Revival will take place in September 2021. Visitors are encouraged to dress in period clothing to celebrate the golden era of motorsport. Isn’t it good to be back at Goodwood and escape from the present day for a weekend?\n\nGravity – 19 September\n\nGravity is one of the largest modified car shows in the UK. To celebrate its fifth anniversary, the event will take place in four exhibition halls and two outdoor arenas at Stoneleigh Park, Warwickshire. Around 1,000 modified, classic, drift and race cars will be on display.\n\nClassics on the Common – 22 September\n\nFor one day every year, Harpenden is invaded by classic cars as it plays host to the UK’s largest weekday car show. If you want to book a day off work, Classics in the Common will take place on Wednesday 22 September 2021.\n\nMcRae Rally Challenge – 2-3 October\n\nBilled as one of the biggest celebrations since Colin McRae became World Rally Champion in 1995, this event will commemorate Colin, as well as Jimmy, Alistair and rising star Max McRae. Knockhill is the venue for this great event.\n\nGTI Festival – 10 October\n\nAnother Santa Pod event, this time for Volkswagen enthusiasts. This is one of the last events of the year before we start thinking about putting our cars into winter hibernation.\n\nGoodwood 78th Members’ Meeting – 16-17 October\n\nThe rescheduled 78th Members’ Meeting will take on the weekend of 16 and 17 October. All tickets will automatically roll over from 2020 and remain valid for the new dates in 2021.\n\nLondon to Brighton Veteran Car Run – 7 November\n\nLast year was the first time the London to Brighton Veteran Car Run has been cancelled since 1947. Hopes are high that the event will go ahead in 2021, when cars registered before 1 January 1915 set off from Hyde Park for the 60-mile journey to Brighton."
