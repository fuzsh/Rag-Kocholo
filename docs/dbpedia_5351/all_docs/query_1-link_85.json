        "text": "Classic Car Auctions (CCA) launches the first cars consigned to its Christmas Sale on December 10th at the Warwickshire Event Centre, continuing its record breaking year.\n\nCCA has been chosen by a local to man to bring his very special, one owner, Ford Escort XR3i to the market place. Owned from new since 1st August 1988, new plate day, this remarkable car has covered just 2,849 miles in 34 years, that is less than 84 miles per annum.\n\nIt comes with a raft of its original paperwork, including of course its original book pack, and has many MOTs down the years. Last driven in 2016, when it was MOT’d and serviced, including a cambelt and water pump, it has since been stored by our vendor.\n\nThe vendor has chosen CCA to bring his one-off car to the market so that he can use the funds to treat his young granddaughter.\n\nWe really can have no idea quite what the car may achieve, value wise, who could? Its unrepeatable. Could it be £10,000, almost certainly, £20,000, undoubtedly, £30,000, quite possibly, but of course it could be worth lots more in fact. The vendor has agreed to bring the car to the market at No Reserve. On that basis the market place will decide its value, every bidder knowing that they could be the lucky owner of perhaps the lowest mileage and most desired Ford XR3i in the world.\n\nGary Dunne, CCA Sales Manager, says: “There are other notable cars in the sale including a lovely low mileage Land Rover with just over 18,000 miles from new, a sensational Ford Mustang Fastback from the 1970s, which has some wonderful modifications including Mach 1 styling with a rear spoiler, bonnet power bulge and front splitter. We also have a lovely pair of convertibles, an MG Rover RV8 and a lovely Alfa Romeo Spider, and there are also others including a rare Fiat Coupe and an astonishing Mini Custom that just has to be seen.”\n\nFind more info:\n\nClassic Car Auctions December Sale\n\nIf you found this article of interest, you may also enjoy…\n\nWheeler Dealers take on a high mileage modern classic\n\nMe and My Car – Mark Stewart’s Ford Escort RS Turbo\n\nGoodwood has announced the dates for its 2023 motorsport and motoring events.

Back in June, the Festival of Speed witnessed Wayne Rainey riding his 1992 World Championship-winning Yamaha YZR500 for the first time since the accident in 1993 that left him paralysed from the chest down, an outbreak of ‘Mansell Mania’ arrived in West Sussex, and the 23-year outright Hill record was broken by the McMurtry Spéirling driven by Max Chilton. All this alongside global debuts galore from the world’s leading manufacturers, taking advantage of the Festival’s international status and enormous media reach. More recently in September, the Revival honoured Her Majesty Queen Elizabeth II, hosted the inaugural Revive & Thrive Village, and celebrated 10 years of the children’s pedal car race, the Settrington Cup, in addition to three days of thrilling on-track action.\n\nIn 2023, the Festival of Speed will celebrate 30 years as the destination for innovation, technology and future mobility. The ever-popular Electric Avenue presented by bp pulse and Future Lab presented by Randox will remain at the heart of the spectacular event, which will also host legendary motorsport teams, drivers and riders from both past and present.\n\nIn September the 25th edition of the world’s greatest weekend of historic motor racing will take place, as the Goodwood Revival continues to champion the ‘Make Do and Mend’ approach of the post-war era alongside second-hand sustainability. Expect a packed schedule of workshops, presentations and talks in the Revive & Thrive Village, as well as greater use of future-proof sustainable fuels in the cars taking to the track.\n\nFurther details of the 2023 motorsport events will be announced in the months ahead.\n\nThe Duke of Richmond, founder of Goodwood’s motorsport events, said: ‘Following a spectacular season at Goodwood, we’re delighted to announce the dates of our 2023 motorsport events, as we start preparing for an exhilarating year both on and off the track. 2023 is already set to be very special as we celebrate 75 years of motorsport at Goodwood, encompassing 25 years of the Goodwood Road Racing Club, 30 years of the Festival of Speed and 25 years of Revival – it’s certainly going to be an unmissable year.’\n\nWhen do Goodwood Festival of Speed tickets go on sale?\n\nTickets for The Festival of Speed and Goodwood Revival will be on sale at goodwood.com on the following dates:\n\nSaturday 29 October – Goodwood Road Racing Club Members\n\nMonday 31 October – Goodwood Road Racing Club Fellowship\n\nMonday 7 November – General Public\n\nAs in previous years, children aged 12 and under go free and a Young Person ticket will also be available for those aged between 13 and 21.\n\nSave 10% on Goodwood tickets!\n\nNew for the 2023 events, customers can save 10% on Festival of Speed and Goodwood Revival admission tickets in the early bird windows.

Mike and Elvis were ready to put that to the test with a brilliant supercharged Jaguar.\n\nThe Jaguar S-Type R is a proper sporting saloon, but the one Mike had found for sale was showing a high mileage of 195,000 miles on the clock. Although about average for the year, it was the sort of number that can put buyers off but should they really be worried? We were about to find out.\n\nCar dealer, Richard, wanted £3500 for the car and with a 4.2-litre supercharged V8 making around 460bhp thanks to a few upgrades it was certainly tempting. The thick wad of service history was reassuring and the test drive didn’t reveal any major concerns, although Mike knew that a service of that supercharger was needed. Keen to do a deal it was his for just £2950.\n\nBack at the workshop Elvis wasn’t fazed by the mileage but the important thing would be the health of that powerful motor. Did it still have plenty of life left in it or was there trouble ahead? There was only one way to find out, and the first job was to take a closer look at the supercharger. With the top cover removed, the master mechanic found something he didn’t like. The Teflon coating on the rotors was almost completely worn away, so the unit was removed so they could be sent away to have the coating reapplied.\n\nAnother way of establishing the condition of the engine was to have a sample of the oil analysed. Costing just £30, it would not only reveal whether there was worrying internal wear but could identify other potential problems, too. Hoping for good news, Mike headed to Huddersfield to see the experts at Millers Oils to get the results.\n\nThe first discovery was that the viscosity of the oil was a bit thick, but that wasn’t a major concern. An absence of metal particles in the oil was good news, too, as it meant the engine wasn’t suffering from excessive wear. But there was one thing that set alarm bells ringing – high levels of sodium in the oil, which pointed to the presence of coolant. A further check revealed that instead of an expected reading of 1000 parts per million the Jaguar was showing 2500ppm. Could that mean head gasket trouble?\n\nThis wasn’t such welcome news for Elvis, so some investigation was needed. The first was a pressure test of the cooling system, and there was no problem there. Then it was a ‘sniff test’ where chemicals are used to see whether there are combustion gases in the coolant – no problems there, either. And lastly, a borescope inspection of each cylinder to look for even carbon build-up on the pistons. That was fine, too.\n\nHaving ruled-out head gasket failure, and with the supercharger now serviced and re-fitted, Elvis got on with giving the engine a thorough service – new Iridium spark plugs were fitted along with new filters, and finally an engine flush and refill with the correct 5w/30 fully synthetic oil.\n\nThe brilliant Jaguar performed perfectly on the test drive, and it certainly impressed the Chairman of the Jaguar Drivers’ Club, Roger Kemp. It now owed the boys £3654, but buyer, Sally, was happy to pay £4350 to get her hands on this tasty performance car. That high mileage was nothing to worry about after all…\n\nMike said: “High mileage cars have always carried a stigma in the used car trade. In the classic car world, it’s likely that an engine may have had a rebuild at some point either the top end or the bottom end and that’s why sometimes it’s not worth me mentioning the mileage on cars that I buy.\n\n“However, once I found this Jaguar, I knew that it handled and drove really well, even though it was showing near 200,000 miles the reason being is it had a comprehensive service history. Taking the oil to get it analysed was a smart move and one that doesn’t get used in car restoration that often. It can inhibit the need to remove the engine from the car which is what I was hoping for. To discover our engine was in tiptop health was a relief, and to prove the fact that it still felt like new, we took it to a track where even the chairman of the Jaguar Drivers Club couldn’t tell the difference between our car and the car that had only covered a tenth of the mileage. I’d say that was a result for both myself and Elvis, and it’s now certainly got us looking at cars that have covered more miles.\n\n“When I was at the oil analysis, I asked the chap what’s the highest mileage he deals with and he said he regularly sees lorries that have covered over 2,000,000 miles with not much wrong with them!”\n\nFind more info:\n\nDiscovery UK – Wheeler Dealers\n\nJoin the club:\n\nJaguar Drivers Club\n\nJaguar Enthusiasts Club\n\nIf you found this article of interest, you may also enjoy…\n\nWheeler Dealers restore a brilliant Italian classic\n\nThe Jaguar XJ Supersport\n\nMe and my car: Tom Robinson and his Jaguar XJR 6\n\nRM Sotheby’s has announced the incredible Gran Turismo Collection, which offers a stunning selection of some of the most iconic cars of the past 50 years, all offered from within a highly curated single-owner collection.\n\nMichael Squire, a Senior Car Specialist and Director of Research at RM Sotheby’s, says: “This is certainly one of the most remarkable single-owner collections of supercars to be offered in Europe, and further reinforces our global reputation for bringing fine collections to market. We are privileged to have been entrusted with this unbelievable collection of cars. It represents a cross section of supercars and GTs which are at the zenith of desirability in today’s market. The Group B rally cars are an additional, remarkable highlight, perfectly encapsulating the peak of rallying’s most extreme era.”\n\nFor many, it is the Ferrari marque that best defines the true meaning of the word ‘supercar’, and the 1980s was the decade in which the term really established itself in the motoring vocabulary. It’s probably accurate to say the 288 GTO was the first Ferrari to take the concept of a fast road car to a new level, developed, as it was, for Group B competition, and being only the second homologation Ferrari road car to boast ‘GTO’ nomenclature since the legendary 250 GTO. The 1985 Ferrari 288 GTO offered in the Collection is a beautifully maintained example, finished in Rosso Corsa and with 23,615 kilometres on the odometer (Estimate: £3,250,000 – £4,000,000). Also on offer is a 1991 Ferrari F40, one of the most exotic and coveted of all Ferrari road cars, and perhaps the last of the truly analogue Ferrari supercars. Boasting a mighty twin-turbo V-8, it still remains to be one of the most thrilling supercars ever built (Estimate: £1,400,000 – £1,600,000). The F40s successor was the incredible F50, and the 1997 Ferrari F50 offered is one of just 349 produced and boasting significant Formula One derived technology of the period (Estimate: £3,250,000 – £4,000,000). But to complete the Ferrari ‘Big 5’, the Collection also features a 2003 Ferrari Enzo (Estimate: £1,800,000 – £2,200,000) and a 2014 Ferrari LaFerrari (Estimate: £2,000,000 – £2,500,000), both the pinnacle of automotive technology at the time of their launches and both delivered new to the current owner. The Collection also features a trio of Giallo open-top Ferraris including a 2011 Ferrari 599 SA Aperta (Estimate: £1,100,000 – £1,400,000), a 2000 Ferrari 550 Barchetta Pininfarina (Estimate: £180,000 – £230,000), and a 2006 Ferrari Superamerica (Estimate: £190,000 – £230,000).\n\nBy the 1990s, Bugatti was a marque which hadn’t produced anything meaningful since the second world war. But all that changed with the launch of the fearsome EB110, a car which brought the famous name back into the public consciousness with brutal performance, exotic looks, and state-of-the-art engineering. The 1993 Bugatti EB110 GT offered a quad turbo 3.5-litre V-12 that took the car all the way to 213 mph, the one on offer is a beautiful example finished in Bugatti Blu paint with a Grey interior (Estimate: £1,500,000 – £2,000,000). But for anyone wanting the peak development of the model, there is also an opportunity to acquire a rare 1996 Bugatti EB110 Super Sport, which boasted even greater performance figures thanks to a range of modifications and 150 kg less weight. Around 30 SS models were constructed (Estimate: £2,500,000 – £ 3,000,000). Since the EB110, Bugatti returned with a series of models that have redefined performance and engineering expectations at the pinnacle of the supercar market. None more so than the 2022 Bugatti Chiron Super Sport 300+ to be offered in London. The ultimate variant of the already extreme Chiron, the example on offer features a Black Carbon exterior with Jet Orange stripes and has covered a mere 1,416 miles. It is the one of only 30 ever produced and the fastest of all the Chiron versions, with an incredible top speed of 304 mph (Estimate: £4,000,000 – £4,500,000).\n\nBut you can’t have a Gran Turismo Collection without two of the key 20th-century cars to leave the Lamborghini factory. The 1971 Lamborghini Miura SV by Bertone continues to turn heads more than 50 years after its launch, and the car offered is presented in the dramatic colour of Miura Verde. Known for its thrilling, transversely mounted V-12 engine and jaw-dropping looks, this is arguably the genesis of the modern supercar (Estimate: £1,900,000 – £2,200,000). Representative of what is possibly the most outrageous supercar of its era is the 1984 Lamborghini Countach LP5000 S by Bertone. With its Gandini-designed bodywork and scissor doors, this example boasts ‘S’ specification, and looks incredible in dramatic white over white. Incredibly, it is being offered by its second owner (Estimate: £380,000 – £500,000).\n\nThe Collection also features three stunning Group B rally cars, all boasting incredible provenance. The Works 1982 Lancia 037 Group B rally car was driven by rally superstars Markku Alén and Walter Röhrl, with Röhrl winning the 1983 ADAC Rallye Deutschland at the wheel (Estimate: £950,000 – £1,200,000). The Works 1986 Lancia Delta S4 Group B, presented in stunning Martini livery, was the 1986 Monte Carlo rally winner in the hands of Finnish rally legend, Henri Toivonen; this victory would be his last in WRC, and this S4 is one of the most outstanding Group B cars in existence (Estimate: £1,750,000 – £2,250,000). No Group B lineup is complete without an Audi, and the Works 1985 Audi Quattro S1 E2 Group B is a highly significant example of the breed. Powered by Audi’s incredible 550-hp, 2.1-litre 5-cylinder engine, the Quattro S1 is up there with the most iconic and recognisable rally cars of all time. The example offered was used by World Rally Champion Hannu Mikkola for the 1985 RAC Rally and is presented in its works livery (Estimate: £1,750,000 – £2,250,000).\n\nThis remarkable collection is rounded up by two exceptionally rare Jaguars. Only nine competition-bred TWR Jaguar XJ220s were completed and six of these were made as road-going S models. Produced as a limited-production, road-going version, to comply with homologation requirements, the 1993 Jaguar XJ220 S on offer is a rare and exotic beast. Presented in orange over grey, this 217-mph car represents an incredibly rare opportunity for collectors (Estimate: £850,000 – £1,100,000). But for many, the ultimate example of TWR’s development of high performance Jaguar road cars is the 1991 Jaguar XJR-15, essentially a racecar modified for the road. With just 53 made, and with its DNA developed from the Le Mans-winning XJR-9, this is an incredibly special part of Jaguar’s 20th-century heritage. Remarkably, this example has only 67 miles on its odometer (Estimate: £950,000 – £1,200,000).\n\nFind more info:\n\nRM Sotheby’s\n\nIf you found this article of interest, you may also enjoy…\n\nZytek reveals concept electric classic race car\n\n‘Old out ya hand! Auto Alex and Jonny Smith join Mike Brewer at NEC Classic\n\nCatch my Drift: Car & Classic’s 1967 Mustang Fastback gallops again\n\nPolaris’ all-women team of riders from across Europe have successfully completed the Polaris Outlanding Project – a week-long, 100% outdoor expedition across the volcanic landscape of Iceland – that took place this September.\n\nWith a strong female-forward focus, six women represented Polaris from France, Germany, Spain, Sweden and the UK, all with a shared passion for the outdoors and adventure. But this wasn’t just an expedition to showcase the capabilities of Polaris’ side-by-side lineup in this harsh environment; it was a chance to inspire other riders to take on similar challenges in these types of vehicles, provide a unique perspective on adventure and how to achieve it, and to encourage other women riders who are ready to explore to start planning. After months of preparation, the team ventured into the wilderness of Iceland with just their vehicles and their camping equipment to sustain them – and all returned with countless memories.\n\nThis journey of a lifetime took the riders out of the capital, Reykjavik, past glaciers, geysers and geothermal pools of the east into the snowy mountain passes of the north, before returning south through barren lava fields and long stretches of black sand. The team manoeuvred over 1,200 kilometres almost entirely on non-tarmac roads: Slow speeds, carefully-considered tyre placement and unfaltering concentration were key in making sure the routes were safely navigated.\n\n“To think this all started with a view to showcase our off-road products in the dramatic landscape of Iceland – a utopia for these vehicles – but it actually turned out to be so much more than we could have imagined,” said Marion Chouanneau, Polaris Off Road Vehicles EMEA Marketing Manager. “The route made for incredible views, technical terrain and a big test of willpower, but it was met with unfaltering enthusiasm and confidence by the whole team, and without a single flat tyre! It was easy to forget that this expedition was a test of the vehicles’ strength, but rather our own. I’m so proud to be a part of this amazing team of women, and to work for the brand whose vehicles have performed so spectacularly on this project.”\n\nAccompanying the riders were three Polaris off-road vehicles; the Polaris General 1000 Deluxe ABS, the Polaris Ranger 1000 Nordic Pro Edition, and the Polaris RZR XP 1000 – all suited to different tasks, usage and terrain, but all overcoming every natural obstacle that Iceland had to throw their way.\n\nThe ultimate adventure side-by-side – the General – spearheaded the project, specially-equipped with essential camping equipment including a CAMPWERK iKamper top tent, a Taubenreuther special design Multi-Rack storage solution, XOBI outdoor kitchen, Pro Armor® light bar, front hood storage and much more. Made to take on the trails with unrivalled performance, the RZR proved its strength, power and control over the harsh terrain in Iceland, taking on every boulder and water crossing with complete ease and confidence, making even the toughest of trails a joy to ride. Polaris’ utility side-by-side, the Ranger, is a proven workhorse and its ability to keep on going was invaluable on this expedition. Not only could it carry all the team’s equipment in its cargo bed, but its in-cab heater and comfy bench seats were a welcome addition to this trip.\n\nArrival in Iceland\n\nThe team received a very warm and heartfelt welcome from the crew at Stormur EHF in Reykjavik – Polaris’ official distributor in Iceland – to begin the project, met with the three exquisitely-prepared vehicles at the dealership, ready to be loaded full of their camping equipment and essentials to see them through the next week of exploration in Iceland.\n\nDay 1: 135 miles / 217 kilometres\n\nDiving in at the deep end is a good way to start any trip – and that’s exactly what the team did. The ride started rough and technical through the rift Valley of Þingvellir – a great way to get into the riding rhythm. No visit to Iceland is complete without a customary visit to the Geysir geothermal area to see the exploding 30-metre-high Strokkur geyser, as well as Gullfoss (which translates to ‘Golden Falls’), one of Iceland’s most loved waterfalls located in the canyon of the Hvítá river. 135 miles from their starting point in Reykjavik, the team arrived at Hveravellir Lodge – a highland oasis in the middle of Iceland – ready for their first night of camping.\n\nDay 2: 124 miles / 200 kilometres\n\nDay 2 was a turning point for the team, now realising that the terrain in Iceland is unlike any they had ridden across before, and that the Polaris vehicles can handle it all with ease. To think the roads they had covered are all regular legal routes in Iceland is as surprising as it is inspiring; certainly not for the faint-hearted but in these off-road vehicles, the team felt confident. Riding up to the far north of the island, the mountain passes were already covered in snow this time of the year, followed by vast, flowing valleys surrounded by untouched waterfalls and weaving tracks: This particular route unveiled the true beauty of the rural highlands of Iceland.\n\nDay 3: 88 miles / 142 kilometres\n\nBeing at the northernmost point of the route, even the morning sunlight didn’t stop the brisk Icelandic breeze, but it did make for some beautiful views as the team rode alongside the dramatic coastline and made their way towards the mountains. After a short pitstop at Stormur’s northern dealership for a surprise pizza party, the team continued on to the spectacular 30-metre wide Goðafoss – ‘the waterfall of Gods’ – before reaching the final destination: Mývatn. It would have been rude not to take a dip in the Mývatn Nature Baths to warm up and soak in the healthy minerals whilst watching the sun go down, before an early night to rest up.\n\nDay 4: 218 miles / 350 kilometres\n\nA very long day calls for a very early start. As the morning light broke through the zippers on their tents, the team all thought the same thing: the sun had joined the Outlanding project – finally! On their longest leg of the journey – a route from the north to the south of Iceland – the women rode for over 12 hours without any signs of civilisation, with the exception of a lodge that was already closed for winter. There are probably many countries in the world where you can drive for that amount of time without seeing anyone else, but for its dramatic volcanic landscape with crater-like fields of lava, soft black sand and majestic mountains lurking in the background, Iceland is truly unique.\n\nDay 5: 89 miles / 143 kilometres\n\nTime to see the volcanoes of Iceland. Day 5 was a shorter ride than the team had completed previously, but it was equally as beautiful. Technical routes led them to Krakatindur, an 858m volcano in the vast Nyjahraun lava field, where they set up for a lunchtime picnic in its shadow and gazed at its intimidating beauty.\n\nDay 6: 50 miles / 80 kilometres\n\nThe women finished the trip on a high – a short route that took them through a number of shallow river crossings, presenting the perfect opportunity to give the dusty vehicles a good clean-off. With their wet boots and faces full of smiles, they said a final farewell to their faithful and trusted Polaris vehicles that had allowed them to see the wonders of Iceland – even the hard-to-reach ones.\n\nFind more info:\n\nPolaris Britain\n\nIf you found this article of interest, you may also enjoy…\n\nClassic Driving Tours purchased by Bespoke Rallies\n\nMe and my car: Jane Brinkmann and her Series III ‘Outlaw Daisy’\n\nINEOS Grenadier to cost from £49,000\n\nThis year’s Lancaster Insurance Classic Motor Show, with discovery+, welcomes some new faces to the discovery+ Live Stage with ‘Auto Alex’ Kersten and The Late Brake Show’s Jonny Smith joining Wheeler Dealers’ Mike Brewer.\n\nBest known for presenting Car Throttle and his hilarious impressions of his ‘TV Dad’ Mike Brewer, journalist Alex Kersten can now be seen on YouTube.

Here, he tells Charlotte Vowden why it’s one of the greatest underrated cars of the eighties.\n\nThe quattro was the car that put Audi on our radar screens. Introduced in 1980 as one of the first road vehicles to offer all-wheel drive, its technology propelled the brand into the premium car league and became legendary for charging through forests, ravines and deserts on its way to international rally glory. In 1982, the 100 launched as one the most aerodynamic production cars on the planet at the time, but the 200 came into the world with a little less fanfare. Only five Audi 200 Avant Turbo Quattros remain on UK roads and Josh Spencer considers himself lucky to be one of the custodians…\n\n“I could nerd out about the Audi for ages. It’s an unusual car, with an unusual story and I love what it does for my family; it doesn’t let us down. The first owner was Mrs Haynes, wife of Mr Haynes, who published the workshop manuals. She was quite influential and used it as a company car for 15 years; she clocked up 120,000 miles and it’ll do about 550 miles to a tank so it’s easy to see why. I reached out to their son Chris and he recalled going out and going on holidays in it.\n\nThe Audi was used as a daily until 2001, when it was stored in the Haynes museum in Somerset for the next ten years. It passed through a few people after that, including a scientist who used to take it to the Alps on a skiing trip every year. That’s exactly what the car was designed for and he told me that it always started on the button, even in -20°C. The old cliches are true, classics like to be driven, and with its winter tyres on, I’ve taken the Audi out in snow drifts; absolutely nothing can stop it.\n\nThe 200 wasn’t massively popular back in the eighties. It was boxy and compared to its contemporaries, it was modernist, so it was seen as a car for people that wanted to be a bit different, and not necessarily in a cool way. Somebody dumped one close to where I lived when I was growing up and although my dad salvaged it (we had some unusual cars over the years because my parents were on a bit of budget) the 200 sat on our driveway for ages before getting scrapped. I always thought it was a bit of a shame.\n\nI found my 1986 Audi 200 Avant Turbo Quattro in August 2020. I was conscious about buying the right car at the right price so I still had enough money left over to pay for its upkeep so got my dad, who’s a mechanic, to have a look at it. With a valid MoT, he concluded the car was a rough diamond with potential so I negotiated the price down and drove the 200 miles home – it didn’t miss a beat.\n\nIt was fairly tidy, if a little bit gawky, but I had a vision of what I wanted to achieve. I’m an OEM plus kind of person so any modifications had to be as close to original as possible, but as one of five on the road in the UK, part of the game is sourcing the parts. I’ve kept everything that’s been taken off so it can all be reversed.\n\nThe aero Centra wheels divide opinion which is great because it makes them a talking point. I found them in Lithuania, where there’s a huge following of eighties cars, and had them refaced. I then worked with a local engineer to create the centre caps from scratch. For me, it’s all about taking care of the small details and he did an amazing job of milling and machining the iconic Audi rings. Originally, the 200 had a full orange and red light bar at the back but I wanted a look that would compliment the wheels so found a new one with a black centre and painted original 100 Avant lenses, for an ‘Audi Sport’ look.\n\nI’m a trained mechanic and engineer so I’m quite practical and have done a lot of jobs myself, but I know when to get a specialist involved, such as when I got it rust-proofed. Unexpected age-related issues do occasionally come up; the air conditioning system was blocked up with 30 years of muck which meant that when I started using it properly this summer every time I accelerated or went up a hill water sloshed into the passenger footwell through the vent. Clearing it out was a tricky job.\n\nAs standard, the 200 came with the same 2.1 turbo engine and driveline as the Ur-quattro [the original Audi quattro] as well as cruise control, a manual five-speed box, ABS, trip computer, electric memory seats in the front, climate control, and an electric sunroof, mirrors and windows. The optional extras list was pretty short and included things like a load cover; I installed my own using parts I sourced from three different people. It was also one of the first mass-produced cars in the UK to come with a space saver wheel; it was so far ahead of its time.\n\nEvery car, like every household, has its own distinctive smell which can transport you back to a place or a moment in time. I’ve been brought to tears in the Audi because it’s reminded me of childhood road trips with my parents and grandparents. My one-year-old son slept in the Audi virtually all the way to and from the Festival of the Unexceptional this year, about 230 miles, which I think says a lot about how quiet and comfortable it is. My wife and I were a bit worried about him projectile vomiting everywhere because with all that turbocharged boost there can be quite a lot of body roll, but he’s never been sick in the car, which I’m hugely grateful for! When I’m on my own I tend to throw it about a bit more and it’ll keep up with hot hatches which is both ridiculous and immense.\n\nI’m lucky to be in a position where I can cherish the Audi as a toy because none of it really makes financial sense, but we come into the world with nothing and we go out of it with nothing so we might as well enjoy life while we are here. It would be lovely to see somebody else enjoy it one day, but as a car fanatic who is always looking around for other options, there’s nothing I’d want to replace it with.\n\nMy wife didn’t really understand why I wanted the Audi at first but she’s definitely come round to it, dare I say she’s actually come to love it, and I think that’s partly because of the response it gets from other people as well as seeing how much it means to me. From a group of Germans on a driving tour to designers for JLR, kids and people my own age, the Audi has blown people’s minds because they admire it, remember it or have never seen a car like it before. If we were to have another baby, I think I’d even get to bring it home from the hospital in the 200 and there is no greater compliment than that! It’s a consummate family classic.\n\nI do ponder over the relationship my son will have with cars in the future, but we want him to enjoy whatever he wants rather than force him to like them. He’s got loads of different types of toys, from instruments to books, dolls, trucks and a couple of diggers, and it’s important that he comes to his own conclusions naturally. Having said that, we are looking at getting him an Austin J40!”\n\nJoin the Club:\n\nAudi Owners Club\n\nClub Audi\n\nWant to share the story of your car?
