        "text": "Mike Brewer, 59, who is best known for hosting ‘Wheeler Dealers’ on the Discovery Channel, where he and his team purchase surplus cars, restore them, and then sell them on for a profit, was at the venue near Marlow on Sunday, July 14.\n\nHis presence in South Bucks was on the behalf of Sporting Bears, a not-for-profit organization which raises much-needed funds for causes through car events.\n\nAnd those who attended the event would have seen numerous supercars in the flesh.\n\nIn all, members of the public were able to arrive free of charge and pay a donation to be a passenger in the motor of their choice.\n\nThat car would hit several top speeds along the air park’s runway, with the rider being accompanied by a professional driver.\n\nSpeaking ahead of the event, Brewer said: “I just walked through the cars down here and there’s everything from an Enzo to an SF90 and I bet there’s about £8-£10m worth of cars for everyone to enjoy.\n\n“So when you come here, point out a car that you want to go in, get your phone out and make your mates jealous.”\n\nHe continued: “You don’t get to drive them, but you get to be a passenger and ride in them.\n\n“All the money raised on the day will go to a children’s charity.”\n\nSome of the cars that were used for the event included a McClearn Senna, a Ferrari Enzo, a Ferrari SF90, a Ferrari 458, and Ferrari 488 Pista."
