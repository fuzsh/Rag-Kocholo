        "text": "Wheeler Dealers host Mike Brewer has opened up on working with Edd China’s replacements Ant Anstead and Marc Priestley.\n\nThe TV star hosted the iconic car restoration show with Edd between 2003 and 2017 before they parted ways.\n\nEdd officially explained he quit due to creative differences with the new American producers of the show.\n\nAnt Anstead took over the role in late 2017 and worked alongside Mike for three seasons.\n\nThe new duo were flying high in America in late 2019 when Mike’s mother had become “desperately ill”.\n\nREAD MORE Mike Brewer says there was ‘no feud’ with Edd China after Wheeler Dealers split\n\nMike talked to show bosses who agreed he could bring the show back to Britain but Ant decided to stay behind. The TV host admitted Ant had become “anchored” to America and “had a life” Stateside after the birth of his child.\n\nBut, he praised Ant for his support in relaunching the show back in Britain despite not being involved.\n\nSpeaking to the Road to Success podcast: “I was given this opportunity to bring Wheeler Dealers back to the UK because of my family. They said ‘you need to be near your family, do you want to go back home, do you want to be next to them’.\n\n“And I said of course I do, I need to be there for them. I love the show but it’s not as important as being next to my family during this crisis.\n\nDON'T MISS\n\nWheeler Dealers' Mike Brewer claims he was ‘recognised’ and ‘shot at’ in warzone [LATEST]\n\nWheeler Dealers’ Edd China’s ‘pantomime’ theory on Mike Brewer as host opens up [ANALYSIS]\n\nWheeler Dealers’ Mike Brewer on last time he saw Edd China - reunion verdict [COMMENT]\n\nInvalid email\n\nWe use your sign-up to provide content in ways you've consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

Be with your family, Don't worry about me, don’t worry about this TV show, go home. Go home and talk about how we can create Wheeler Dealers in the UK’.”\n\nMike got back in touch with Ant to pitch the idea of a UK return for Wheeler Dealers but the former co-host opted to stay.\n\nHe added: “When I reached out with Ant, he was already on a different career path. He’s Mr Hollywood, he’s a great-looking guy, sparkle in the eye. He can achieve anything, he’s brilliant.\n\n“Ant said ‘just go and do it but don’t f*** it up'. So I said to Elvis (Marc Priestley), do you want to be the mechanic on Wheeler Dealers.”\n\nThe former McLaren F1 mechanic had experience on TV having been involved with Mike’s DreamCar series.\n\nMike continued: “[Elvis] thought I was joking, told me to f*** ff. He put down the phone to me, phoned Ant and said ‘Mike’s just asked me to join him on Wheeler Dealers’.\n\n“And Ant said ‘please do it, don't f*** it up, please do it, do it with my love’. So Elvis became my wingman on Wheeler Dealers and thankfully he did because it’s just been amazing working with him.\n\n“This next evolution of Wheeler Dealers, the last four years dong Dream Car and Wheeler Dealers with Elvis has been the most fantastic [time].”"
