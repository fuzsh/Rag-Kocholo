        "text": "I have watched the 3 episodes of the new series and I quite enjoyed them. Still cannot stand Mike Brewer (not that I would send him death threats, who the hell would do that and for what reason?), but Ant is obviously very knowledgeable and I think his presence has livened up a tired show.\n\nI think that Edd was becoming part of the problem also, it was the same thing from him every time, \"take this to a garage and it would cost you £200/£800\" or \"spray this in satin black\" god he must have bought the worlds stock of satin black).\n\nIt does seem as though all of these programs have to have an incredibly annoying presenter, Mike Brewer (really annoying), Tim Shaw (I even think he is worse than Brewer) and the worst of the lot.... Richard Rawlings from Fast and Loud (Gas Monkey).\n\nThey just can't help but recap every five minutes. Doesn't take too long to get used to Ant but Mike's as annoying as ever.\n\nTo be it's not the only programme. Lots do it.\n\nThey tell you what they're going to do, then do it and show you. Then later they come back and show you again, reminding you that they'd shown you it before, in case you forgot. More obvious when there's adverts between. It can also fill up the time.\n\nNot the same but just as annoying, in \"Saving Lives at Sea,\" you get a shot of the lifeboat approaching a victim, by the end of the shot they're much closer, but then they show you another shot and they're a bit further away now than they were at the end of the last shot. They can do this three or four times. Sometimes I wonder if they're ever going to get there. But, with the dramatic background music, it \"adds drama and takes up a bit of time.\"\n\nI have watched the 3 episodes of the new series and I quite enjoyed them.

Richard Rawlings from Fast and Loud (Gas Monkey).\n\nI just watch Wheeler Dealers on Freeview (don't have Sky) and the Mike/Edd partnership worked ok for me. Mike had his cockney style quirks in presenting but it never bothered me and i'd sooner watch him present than Tim Shaw on SOS who spoilt an otherwise good show through his childish manner which he seemed to believe somehow made him 'funny'.\n\nI never knew until reading this thread that Mike/Edd had split and even more shocked to read Mike and his family receiving death threats on social media. There are some seriously sick people out there.\n\nOn a happier note i watched a WD episode the other day i'd not seen before where Mike and Edd restored a Lamborghini Urraco. Not something i'd fancy working on but quite a rare bird though bottomless pockets would be useful for any owner.\n\nWhilst I do watch and do enjoy the show, the one bit that always annoys the hell out of me is that we could all do what they do if we were all fully trained mechanics with years of experience, a garage and 10 of £1000s worth of equipment.\n\nThat makes a whole mockery out of the shows main point:\n\nOh I brought the car for £500 and spent £400 on parts and then sold it for £1500. Success! pats himself on the back at being such and great Wheeler Dealer.\n\nWHAT ABOUT THE COST OF A FULLY TRAINED MECHANIC WITH ALL THE TOOLS?\n\nAdd the rip off charges that incurs and then see what profit you have! Every show would end with a big minus figure.\n\nWhilst I do watch and do enjoy the show, the one bit that always annoys the hell out of me is that we could all do what they do if we were all fully trained mechanics with years of experience, a garage and 10 of £1000s worth of equipment.\n\nThat makes a whole mockery out of the shows main point:\n\nOh I brought the car for £500 and spent £400 on parts and then sold it for £1500.

Every show would end with a big minus figure.\n\nAgreed.\n\nThis has come up so many times before, I've mentioned it and got shot down for saying it.\n\nIn the first place Ed has access to far more tools and equipment than the average \"one man and a dog,\" garage.\n\nIt's obvious that a lot of specialised equipment was made available for particular jobs.\n\nMike always goes on about the profit they made, completely ignoring the cost of labour.\n\nIn all honesty I think in reality they would have lost quite a bit of money on most cars they sell on. Sometimes Ed is waiting days for parts.\n\nIf you went for a really low rate of £50 an hour, (BMW charge around £200) baring in mind there are no other cars to be seen in for repair, so the on-costs of the garage would have to be factored into the hourly rate for the cars on which Ed works. So each restoration actually costs a fortune.\n\nI wouldn't mention it if Mike didn't bang on about how much they make.\n\nConversely in the US show \"Fantom Works,\" with the restorations there, they tell you the cost of the parts and the hours billed to each car, which are always considerable, but they don't tell you the rate per hour.\n\nAnd the reason you get shot down over it is because the whole premise of the show is work an amateur can do in their own garage. Edd always talked about what can and cannot be done that way in every rebuild, and the cost of work done by outside specialists is always counted. Their garage is of course very well equipped but the point is you could do it with a more basic setup but it would just be harder work. An amateur restorer wouldn't count the cost of his own labour in profit and loss. Nor would a sole trader doing car restoration as a business, it would just be income minus expenditure. If HMRC are happy with this arithmetic for taxation purposes then you ought to be too."
