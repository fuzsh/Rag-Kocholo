        "text": "Festival favourite Mike Brewer is returning to The Classic this summer with his ever-popular Car Clinics now being promoted to an entertainment-packed main stage situated right at the epicentre of fun-fuelled Bank Holiday extravaganza (26-28 August).\n\nSince being introduced in 2014, the much-loved TV personality’s engaging and enjoyable presentations have become one of the festival’s established off-track highlights and a major attraction among the tens of thousands of fans flocking to the world’s biggest historic motor racing festival.\n\nNow, with the infield attractions and activities being further enhanced for the bank holiday weekend in 2022, the star of Discovery Channel’s globally-successful ‘Wheeler Dealers’ television show, will enjoy an even more prominent role at The Classic.\n\nHaving been elevated to the bright lights of the central main stage – also home to live music concerts on all three evenings – Brewer’s popular Car Clinics will take place on both Saturday and Sunday mornings and afternoons, now with support from Car Gods, the event’s new Official Detailing partner. As has proved such a big draw in the past, Brewer will be casting his expert eye over a number of thought-provoking classic cars and discussing restoration projects with their equally passionate owners. Some of the icons coming under scrutiny may include cars as screened on Wheeler Dealers.\n\nAdding to his presence at the Classic, Brewer will also be joined on the Main Stage by fellow presenter – and ex Formula 1 technician – Marc ‘Elvis’ Priestley for a pair of not-to-be-missed masterclasses at lunchtime on both days over the weekend. Further fuelling the festival’s ‘Best of British’ theme, he will also be out-and-about holding ‘pop-up’ car clinics with a number of selected car clubs.\n\n“I’m going to be busier than ever at The Classic which is just wonderful as there’s nothing I like better than sharing my interest and passion for all kinds of cool cars with fellow enthusiasts,” said a revved-up Brewer. “There are few better events on Earth than The Classic and I really can’t think of a better place to spend my August Bank Holiday weekend than with so many of my fellow car lovers at Silverstone. It’s going to be quite a party!”\n\nIn addition to presenting Brewer’s Car Clinics, Car Gods will have an interactive presence in a special Showcase area close to the event’s busy Shopping Village and Village Green hub. Here visitors will be able to watch many of Car Gods’ coveted range of 60+ hand-crafted, UK design and produced automotive detailing products in action as they fulfill detailing and protection work on a legendary AC Cobra.\n\n“The opportunity to become the Official Detailing Partner of such a prestigious automotive event is fantastic. Car Gods custom detailing is born in the UK with everything from product development, marketing, manufacturing and distribution from our site in the North West of England. During The Classic event we will showcase our professional range of products and accessories with live demonstrations, fantastic product offers and giveaways.” commented Peter Schofield, Chairman of Tetrosyl – the parent company and manufacturer of the Car Gods brand.\n\nProviding exceptionally good value, all tickets for The Classic include access to the main stage for both Mike Brewer’s Car Clinics, presented by Car Gods and the live music performances from chart-toppers including Sister Sledge, Gabrielle and Rick Astley.\n\nTickets also provide admission to the world-exclusive display of Lewis Hamilton’s seven title winning racers plus a special Formula 1 showcase as well as both racing paddocks, open trackside grandstand seating, fun fair rides and the new-for-2022 Foodie Fest which features both cooking demos from celebrity chefs and a ‘pop-up’ from Jeremy Clarkson’s world famous Diddly Squat Farm Shop."
