The programme is fronted by car enthusiast and former dealer Mike Brewer with mechanics Edd China (Series 1-13), Ant Anstead (Series 14–16), and Marc Priestley, (Series 17-present) The premise of the show has the presenters on a mission to save old and repairable enthusiast vehicles, by repairing or otherwise improving an example of a particular make and model to a budget then selling it to a new owner.\n\nThe programme was created by Daniel Allum and Michael Wood, the founding directors of Attaboy TV, both long-time car enthusiasts.\n\nSeries 1 was aired in 2003. Series 5 was renamed Wheeler Dealers On the Road, with Brewer and China expanding their car search by heading out into Europe hoping to find classic cars to buy and restore. The second half of Series 6 was aired in the autumn of 2009 on Discovery Real Time.\n\nBeginning with part 2 of Series 8, Brewer further expanded their horizon by touring the United States. In Series 12, Brewer and China set up a new workshop in a rented bay at Huntington Beach Bodyworks, 18108 Redondo Circle, Huntington Beach, California. This decision was made so that they could deliver more episodes of the show and meant they were able to restore and sell the cars on the spot, instead of having them shipped back to the UK. Once the American operation was established, it moved to more suitable premises at 5382 Research Drive, Huntington Beach. Series 17 (2021) saw the show filming return to the UK.[2]\n\nWheeler Dealers has spawned a number of derived series such as Wheeler Dealers: Trading Up in which Brewer travels around the world attempting to trade his way up to a supercar, Wheeler Dealers: Dream Car where Brewer and mechanic Marc \"Elvis\" Priestley lend their expertise to add value to clients' cars to help them trade up to their dream vehicle, and most recently Wheeler Dealers World Tour.\n\nFormat\n\n[edit]\n\nIn each episode, Brewer buys a vehicle, turns it over to his mechanic for repairs, then sells it. For the first series, the budget was £1,000, for series 2, £2,000, and for series 3, £3,000. Budgets in subsequent series have varied, depending on the target vehicle. For example, a £10,000 budget was set on buying and restoring a Ferrari Dino 308 GT4 in series 6. For series 11 (2014), the budget is listed on the show's Discovery UK website as \"up to £20,000\". The presentation for each project usually follows a similar TV format. Through series 6, the project was presented in two 30-minute episodes. Starting with series 7, the format was changed to single 60 minute (including commercials) episodes.\n\nSummary\n\n[edit]\n\nThe programme was created with a DIYer in mind. The costs, and thus any profit or loss for a given project, are assessed without consideration of the labour costs of the mechanic (the assumption is that a well-equipped and able enthusiast could complete all work him or herself) but if repairs require professional help, like body resprays, complicated electronics, or windscreen replacements, they are added to the final cost.\n\nAlso addressed on each vehicle are its service history, bodywork defects (e.g. rust, dents), worn-out interiors and accessories. Vehicles that have either been inactive for long periods of time or purchased from outside the UK are restored and modified to pass the country's mandatory MOT test.\n\nIn common with most similar programmes, Wheeler Dealers features much incidental on-screen advertising. Logos for tools, supplies and equipment are always prominently displayed. Specialist repairers of parts and sub-systems, along with upholsterers, etc. always get adequate coverage in return for favourable price deals. Sometimes, parts and equipment are supplied free of charge.\n\nPart one\n\n[edit]\n\nBrewer starts with a budget to buy and then fix up a vehicle.\n\nBrewer gives a brief history of the merits of the chosen model of vehicle.\n\nBrewer locates, test drives, negotiates for and buys the vehicle (usually sealed with a handshake and Brewer triumphantly expressing to camera that he's just bought a <name of vehicle>).\n\n(Starting from series 5, prospective cars Brewer wanted to buy, but needed too much work, were shown. This also took place in Series 1, Episode 7).\n\nBrewer turns the vehicle over to the mechanic, and together they assess its needs.\n\nThe mechanic begins work, providing assessments of the work and its challenges.\n\nBrewer stops by the workshop for an overview of progress, and expenditures are reviewed.\n\nPart two\n\n[edit]\n\nA quick review of the first episode (for series where each project is split into two episodes).\n\nBrewer goes on a field trip to procure some required parts.\n\nBrewer interviews an owner of a similar vehicle in top condition, then drives and comments on the car. Brewer also assesses the merit and likelihood of getting the Wheeler Dealers example to the same condition as the example he is driving. (This feature was dropped from series 5 onwards)\n\nThe mechanic finishes the work on the project vehicle which is subsequently shown on a revolving turntable.\n\nBrewer returns to the workshop and discusses the finished vehicle with the mechanic.\n\nThere is a final tally of expenditures.\n\nBrewer drives the completed car, assessing improvements.\n\n(Starting from series 5, Brewer and the mechanic test drive the finished vehicle together and discuss its resale value.)\n\nBrewer sells the vehicle to a new owner (after the inevitable haggling). (Starting from series 5, prospective buyers who failed to buy the car are occasionally shown)\n\nThe deal is sealed when Brewer says, \"Hold out your hand, you've just bought a <name of vehicle>!\" and shakes the new buyer's hand.\n\nBrewer summarises what the final selling price and profit is (or in rare instances what the loss is) and usually states that they have saved another vehicle to be enjoyed by the new owner.\n\nHowever, in interviews, following his leaving the show, Edd China has hinted at, at least, some of the sales not having been 'real.' He stated that he, himself, had possession of both of the Cadillacs from the show.[citation needed]\n\nCast\n\n[edit]\n\nMike Brewer uses his skills as a car trader to scout and buy used cars to be restored and sold for profit. He's also responsible for procuring replacement parts and sometimes specialists to refurbish expensive parts.[citation needed]\n\nEdd China was credited as the show's co-presenter, from series 1 to 13 doing much of the restoration and mechanical/servicing work, and giving viewers tips on how to sort out and solve various car problems, as well as estimating how much a garage would charge for such repairs. There were, however, always two other mechanics credited.\n\nOn 21 March 2017, Velocity announced that China had left the show to \"pursue other projects\" and that he would be replaced by Ant Anstead in series 14. China explained[citation needed] that he chose to leave because he was disagreeing with the channel, which wanted to cut down his fixes and degree of technical information delivered in the workshop.\n\nOn 2 November 2020, it was announced that Marc \"Elvis\" Priestley would replace Anstead as the main mechanic of the show from Series 17, when it returns to the UK after six years filming in the U.S. However, Anstead will appear occasionally as a special guest.[3]\n\nSince series 13, the programme has been produced by Discovery Studios (replacing Attaboy TV that had produced the 12 previous seasons), for Motor Trend.[citation needed]\n\nGuest appearances on other shows\n\n[edit]\n\nWhile buying more American cars for the show, Brewer dropped in on Chip Foose during the 2 June 2013 (Lotus Europa part 2, episode #91, s06e12) of Overhaulin, where Foose showed Brewer the 1972 Lotus Europa he was customising.[citation needed]\n\nTheme music\n\n[edit]\n\nThroughout the 18 series of the programme broadcast so far, three different theme tunes have been used; the current one being \"Balaclava\" by the Wideboys.[citation needed]\n\nThe previous theme was from V-The Production Library by Music 4.[citation needed]\n\nSpin offs\n\n[edit]\n\nWheeler Dealers: Trading UpPresented byMike BrewerCountry of originUnited KingdomNo. of series2No. of episodes12ProductionRunning time60 minutesProduction companyX2 Productions LtdOriginal releaseNetworkDiscovery ChannelRelease2 April 2013 ( ) –\n\n24 November 2014 (2014-11-24)\n\nIn April 2013 a spinoff series titled Wheeler Dealers: Trading Up was launched. This series was produced by X2 Productions Ltd and has Brewer travelling around the world to buy and sell –but not repair or restore– used cars in different countries with the aim of ultimately purchasing a supercar. In the first season he began with $3,000 and traded his way up to a Porsche 911.[4] The series was recommissioned by Discovery Channel International for a second season where Brewer ended up buying a Ferrari.[citation needed]\n\nA second spinoff series titled Wheeler Dealers: Dream Car premiered in January 2020, with Brewer and mechanic Marc \"Elvis\" Priestley lending their expertise to add value to clients' cars helping them trade up to their dream vehicle.[5]\n\nIn 2024, a third spinoff series was released, dubbed Wheeler Dealers World Tour. It premiered in May 2024, with Brewer and mechanic Marc \"Elvis\" Priestley travelling around the world to source for cars that they are going to restore and sell. [6]\n\nEpisodes\n\n[edit]\n\nWheeler Dealers\n\n[edit]\n\nAs of 25 December 2023 269 episodes have been shown, along with 12 recap episodes. For series 1 to 6, each car was covered in two, half-hour episodes (including ad breaks). From series 7 until series 18, each car was covered in a single 60-minute episode.\n\nWheeler Dealers Revisited\n\n[edit]\n\nWheeler Dealers Revisited (ca. 2010)[citation needed] was a set of 5
