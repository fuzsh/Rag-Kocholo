        "text": "Author: Mike Brewer\n\nHardback: 128 pages\n\nPublisher: Veloce (April 2013)\n\nPrice: £16.99 (RRP)\n\nISBN: 978-1-845844-89-9\n\nRecommended? Yes\n\nIf you’re after a motoring tome for a friend or family member (or even for yourself), then look no further than this little gem from Veloce – Mike Brewer’s The Wheeler Dealer Know How. The book is authored by Mike Brewer, the one and only best known UK car expert. Mike is a presenter of various television programmes but most notably Wheeler Dealers – the show where he and Edd China fix up cars to make a profit.\n\nIn the book, Mike presents all the information you need about buying, preparing and selling collectible cars, whether you’re after an MG or a VW! There’s plenty of useful in the book and it starts off where you’d expect – in the buyer’s frame of mind. The tips are extremely useful if you’ve never bought a car before and even if you have it may give you some food for thought (on how to go about buying at an auction for example). Also covered is how to prepare, minor repair and detail any car to ensure that you make the maximum profit when it comes to a sale.\n\nSo, should you buy the book? It comes with a recommendation from Car Articles. Written in the unmissable tone of Mike Brewer, there is plenty of knowledge on offer as well as some funny stories from Brewer’s car dealing days. It’s very enthusiastic in tone and is never condescending. The book is also very easy to read from start to finish."
