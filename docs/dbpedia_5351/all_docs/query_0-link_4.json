        "text": "Mike Brewer (born 28 August 1964) is a British car trader turned presenter of motoring television programmes. He currently presents Wheeler Dealers on the Discovery Channel with Edd China. The other shows have included Driven on Channel 4, Deals on Wheels, Pulling Power, Wrecks To Riches, Auto Trader and Wheeler Dealers Trading Up. With the exception of Driven and Pulling Power, all these shows have subsequently aired on the Discovery Channel. He has appeared in a series called Revved Up in which cars are modified, and presents coverage of the British Rally Championship on Sky Sports. He has presented a show called Remote Madness, in which people with remote controlled mini cars, boats and helicopters compete in a multi challenge race. In 2010, he changed direction and fronted a new Discovery Channel series Frontline Battle Machines, where he went to Afghanistan, and accompanied front line troops, showing how they use their motorised equipment. In 2004, he won the Royal Television Society Midland Centre award for \"Best In Vision Personality\". In addition to his TV career, Mike Brewer is still active in the car industry; opening Mike Brewer Motors in 2012. Wheeler Dealers is a British television series produced by Attaboy TV for the Discovery Channel, fronted by car enthusiast Mike Brewer and mechanic Edd China. (In the United States the series is seen on Discovery's Velocity Channel HD.) The premise of the show is that Brewer and China are on a mission to save old and repairable enthusiast vehicles, by repairing or otherwise improving an example of a particular make and model to a budget, then selling it to a new owner. The show was created by Daniel Allum and Michael Wood, the founding directors of Attaboy TV, both long-time car enthusiasts. There have so far been 13 series of the programme and three different theme tunes have been used; the current one being Balaclava by The Wideboys."
