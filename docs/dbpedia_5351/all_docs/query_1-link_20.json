        "text": "July 5, 2018 by Silverstone Classic\n\n•New support for TV's Wheeler Dealer shows at the Silverstone Classic •Austin 7, 'Frogeye Sprite', MGA and Porsche 356 under the spotlight •Comprehensive selection of world famous Haynes manuals on sale •All tickets must be purchased in advance One of the most famous names in motoring will be in the spotlight at this month's spectacular Silverstone Classic (20-22 July) with today's announcement that Mike Brewer's hugely-popular Car Clinics will be presented by Haynes Publishing. Founded by John Haynes OBE, Haynes Publishing has been the power behind the world's leading illustrated workshop car and motorcycle manuals for more the 50 years. Its range of essential guidebooks will be well-known to the vast majority of the 100,000 attending the magical three-day festival, notably the owners of the 10,000 classic cars that make up the dazzling in-field displays. Enhancing its revered reputation, Haynes Publishing will not only be presenting the Car Clinics hosted by TV personality Brewer from the Discovery Channel's 'Wheeler Dealers' programme but will also have a comprehensive stand from which visitors can purchase manuals. Adding to the collaboration, an Austin 7 'special' and an Austin Healey 'Frogeye' Sprite are among the captivating cars coming under Brewer's expert eye during breaks in the unrivalled roster of retro races. Both of these treasured models have significant pertinence to Haynes. While still at school, in 1956 a young John Haynes wrote and published his book on building a 'special' based on an Austin 7. Then, ten years later, the first 'proper' Haynes Owners Workshop Manual followed the strip-down and rebuild of a Frogeye, complete with the practical step-by-step photography that has become so synonymous with all Haynes manuals. Trending News • INFINITI celebrates 35 years of design at 2024 Pebble Beach Automotive Week\n\n• Less than one week to the 2024 edition of Concorso Italiano A line up of global automotive partners shares the excitement for the Preeminent Italian Lifestyle Event outside of Italy.\n\n• Historic Sportscar Racing (HSR) Marks Fourth Year as Rolex Monterey Motorsports Reunion Sanctioning Body at WeatherTech Raceway Laguna Seca\n\n• TOM PETTY'S 1965 FORD MUSTANG OFFERED AT BONHAMS|CARS QUAIL AUCTION IN MONTEREY, CA ON FRIDAY AUGUST 16\n\n• The first Polestar manufactured in the USA: Production of Polestar 3 starts in South Carolina\n\nWhat's more, the two models coming before Brewer both have great stories to tell. Nick-named 'Simplicity', the Austin 7 was built as a competition special in 1930 by Jack French and today is still regularly seen in VSCC organised sprints and hillclimbs, while the Sprite is arguably the most important in existence having won its class at the 12 Hours of Sebring in 1959. Other notable cars being reviewed on Brewer's stage include an ex-works MGA with RAC Rally and Mille Miglia pedigree, an interesting 1954 Ford Consul MK1 now armed with a 2-litre Ford Zetec heart plus a beautifully restored Porsche 356 – a fine example of the first production model produced by Porsche in 1948, which is celebrating its 70th birthday at this summer's Classic. 'We could hardly have found a more apt – nor able – partner for our Car Clinics than Haynes Publishing. It's a legendary company whose manuals have become a godsend to all those lucky enough to have a classic car in their garage,' said Nick Wigley, CEO of Goose Live Events, organiser of the Silverstone Classic. 'In recent years, Mike's highly informative and entertaining clinics have become a big hit with Silverstone Classic visitors and he certainly has some wonderfully interesting cars to review later this month.' Like so much of the amazing off-track entertainment at the world's biggest classic motor racing festival, admission to Mike Brewer's Car Clinics presented by Haynes Publishing is totally free to all ticket holders along with access to both racing paddocks, open trackside grandstands, vintage funfair rides, the Yokohama Chelsea Skills zone, 4x4 rides, streetcar shootout showdowns, Terry Grant's stunt driving shows plus a host of fun-fuelled family activities on the JET Village Green. Tickets must be purchased in advance and adult admission is priced from just £45 with considerable savings on offer for both families and those spending the full weekend at Silverstone. Hospitality and camping options are also available. Full details can be found on the official www.silverstoneclassic.com website.
