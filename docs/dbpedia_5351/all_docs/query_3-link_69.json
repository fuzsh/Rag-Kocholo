        "text": "What are your thoughts on the quality of work produced by the various TV shows? Here's mine, with ranking 1-10 for quality of work:\n\n10.0: American Hot Rod - Hasn't been on for years, but Boyd's shop produced some show winners. Patterned after American Chopper, but the cars were nice.\n\n9.5: West Coast Customs - from what I can see in HD, they seem to have the best finished work of any current show on TV. Bodywork, paint, details, etc. His cars usually aren't my style.\n\n9.0: X-Treme 4x4 - Ian Johnson seems like he really knows what he's doing. I've caught him doing a few hack-jobs, but he builds real projects from the ground up and they look good and work well in the end.\n\n9.0: Overhaulin' - Chip and the gang go all out and do it right, granted, with lots of new, shiny parts.\n\n9.0: Chop, Cut, Rebuild - Started out so-so but keeps getting better with age. Did you see that orange Hemi they did recently? Wow.\n\n8.5: Muscle Car - Rick Bacon can do bodywork and paint. Tommy Boshers is a full step down from Rick. Some of their projects are a little odd.\n\n8.0: Car Warriors - New show; only one episode so far. Work looks good, but time crunch keeps them from reaching thier potential from a quality standpoint.\n\n8.0: Gearz - Stacey David knows what he's doing and does good work, but he's a little more focused on \"go\" than \"show\".\n\n7.0: Trucks - I like the show, but their overall project quality is hit and miss, though Kevin Tetz can paint.\n\n7.0: Wrecks to Riches: No longer on TV: Barry's Speed Shop would restomod muscle cars for a profit at auction. He was building cars on a budget and took many shortcuts, it seemed to me.\n\n5.0: Unique Whips - lots of low rent stereo installs. Didn't do much bodywork/building until later episodes. His stuff looked second rate to me.\n\n2.0: Wheeler Dealers - Edd is a competent mechanic, but he works like a backyard redneck. The only redeeming part of the show is they usually pick interesting cars (ie. something other than old American iron). Mike Brewer is literally a used car salesman.\n\n1.5: Pimp My Ride - Sketchy work, but Xibit guy is cool.\n\n1.0: Desert Car Kings: A scripted show with a bunch of backyard mechanics that give weekend warriors a bad name!\n\n-5.0: Truck U - No comment necessary.\n\nNot Rated: Trick My Truck I don't watch it.\n\nNot Rated: Horsepower - I like the show, but they don't really \"build\" cars.\n\nNot Rated: Rides - Good show, but it's not really a how-to show, is it?\n\nNot Rated: Livin' the Low Life - Fun to watch, but not a how-to.\n\nI was never all that impressed with American Hotrod (I think Boyd's shop lost a little something after Chip Foose left). I can't get over how tacky the stuff on West Coast Customs is...makes me want to yack looking at it.\n\nDifferent strokes for different folks I guess.\n\nThis made me laugh....perhaps the biggest understatement I've seen on the board.\n\nFoose is a machine - his cars have certainly won awards....most of his recent stuff is so time constrained it's hard to compete on the quality side...but, he still does a good job.\n\nRe: Wheeler/Dealers - I actually like this show, but fast forward through all the test drive, selling stuff. I like that they focus on a segment of vehicles that would otherwise get \"no attention\" (80's and 90's cars)\n\nRe: PowerBlock - I'm a big fan of the Blue Collar build they just completed....I like to see projects that are in reach and truly possible to do for the average joe\n\nRe: Gearz - has there been a new episode of late, like the show but the re-runs kill me and I lose interest\n\nRe: Two guys garage....OCCASSIONALLY they have something really worthwhile. Kevin Byrd did a flip chart explanation of exhaust scavenging and how it interplayed with the V8 firing order....he did a very good job. The other guy is a goof...skilled maybe....but, a goof.\n\nAfter all of that, I'm wondering why I commented"
