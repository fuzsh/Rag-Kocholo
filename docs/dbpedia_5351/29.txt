Wheeler Dealers is a British television series produced by Attaboy TV for the Discovery Channel, fronted by car enthusiast Mike Brewer and mechanic Edd China. (In the United States the series is seen on Discovery's Velocity Channel HD.) The premise of the show is that Brewer and China are on a mission to save old and repairable enthusiast vehicles, by repairing or otherwise improving an example of a particular make and model to a budget, then selling it to a new owner. The show was created by Daniel Allum and Michael Wood, the founding directors of Attaboy TV, both long-time car enthusiasts. There have so far been 13 series of the programme and three different theme tunes have been used; the current one being Balaclava by The Wideboys.
