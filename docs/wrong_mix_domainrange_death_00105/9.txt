If the Beverly Estate's walls could talk, they would have a lot to say. The enormous property, nestled just a mile from the Beverly Hills Hotel, dates back to 1926—and a lot has happened since it was built. It was home to actress Marion Davies and publishing tycoon William Randolph Hearst for 20 years. It was also one of John F. Kennedy and Jackie Kennedy's honeymoon destinations in 1953—and eventually where he and his entire family gathered to celebrate his nomination win following the 1960 Democratic National Convention.

In the 1970s, it became known as "The Godfather House," thanks to its appearance in the award-winning film. And, ever since, it's been front and center in Hollywood, serving as the location for Beyoncé's Black Is King film, as well as Adele's 31st Great Gatsby-themed birthday party. At 50,000 square feet—which includes 28 bedrooms and 38 bathrooms!—it's no wonder this luxury retreat is a celebrity go-to.
