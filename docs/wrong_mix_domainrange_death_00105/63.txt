Wednesday marks 60 years since the assassination of President John F. Kennedy.

The moment forever changed Dallas history, when JFK was killed during a motorcade ride through the city.

More than half a century later, his life continues to inspire and his death continues to spark questions and interpretations about the events of November 22, 1963.

There are different events and exhibits happening in DFW to honor and celebrate the late president's life:

PARK DEDICATION

On Wednesday morning, Parkland Health – where the president was taken after he was shot – is commemorating the new John F. Kennedy Park for Hope, Healing and Heroes. It is now open to the public and is located in front of the Ron J. Anderson Clinic on Parkland Campus. One of the donors of the park is Dr. Ron Jones, who was one of the doctors who treated President Kennedy at Parkland.

Kennedy and the Memory of a Nation” – featuring historic images, news footage, and artifacts. Click here for tickets and more details.

'CITY OF HATE'

After JFK’s assassination, Dallas became known as "City of Hate.” Many were quick to blame Dallas because it was the center of ultra-conservative thought at the time. Countless letters poured into the city, expressing grief and anger. Southern Methodist University saved hundreds of those letters in a special collection called "Dear Dallas.”

NBC 5's Katy Blakey takes a closer look at those incredible letters in a story you have to watch on NBC 5 at 4 p.m.
