        "text": "The two most important refineries of Cuba was owned by Rockefeller of Cuba, one of the largest investments of the Rockefeller in Latin America.\n\nRockefeller's - (Hit-man) Jack Ruby [Unlink]; would send weapons in support of Castro taking hold of Cuba and allowing Rockefeller - (oil rights in Cuba.)\n\nJFK many of times stopped Jack Ruby's shipments from reaching Cuba with Cost Guard intervention. This not only brought to a holt business hopes for both Rockefeller and Ruby but would soon warrant a \"covert conspiracy operation,\" in Dallas, Texas 1963. Not to mention the Prohibition was hurting Ruby's run in Alcohol with his clubs and Bobby Kennedy was going after the mob who, Ruby was involved in.\n\nThe CIA never got too involved because Ruby was in the CIA and his contact ((Rockefeller)) could lean on the big Intelligence agency...\n\nThe motives were endless from both \"Rockefeller and Ruby\" and a grudge was being established.\n\nThe target became clear and the (master-mind,) Jack Ruby was ready to roll his conspiracy operation on a guy people used to call our President. The Target became real to Rockefeller and Ruby his name was; \"John F. Kennedy.\"\n\nRuby planed the motorcade to be the spot for the assassination to take place. Oswald would be the shooter in the library and his job was to shot at the street and sidewalk. While Ruby and his partner were set-up for the kill shot!\n\nPatrick of Chicago - took the first shot to the neck, his (trade-mark) as he became famous in the mob for that particular shot to the neck. Ruby would tell you, \"no one on earth at this time, could match this mans marksmanship. He was the best in the world of shooting. For good measure Ruby took the shot at the \"Grassy- Knowles.\"\n\nRuby's corrupt ties with the \"Dallas Police Dept\" lead to Lee Harvey Oswald Capture and person of interest who they blamed as the shooter. Later Lee was going to give away Ruby's involvement in the conspiracy. That's when Ruby showed up at the police station in Dallas and shot Lee Harvey. To this day the conspiracy ends their...\n\nRuby died in prison from; mysterious death circumstances. And they never explained it in his bio, which leads me to believe that Ruby was dropped off by corrupt police of Dallas at the near by; Executive Airport and Ruby who posses a valid pilots licenses flow to Cuba under Castro protection and got a new life and a new facelift....\n\nMy guess, few years later Ruby re-entered under a Cuban-visa with a new name and went-back to what he was doing before?\n\nOnly Castro and a selected few really know...!\n\nSincerely,\n\nCrixus Imperator\n\nConspiracy Theorist"
