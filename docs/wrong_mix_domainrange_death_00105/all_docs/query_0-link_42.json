Kennedy in Los Angeles, for the 1960 Democratic National Convention.\n\nI've been thinking about Kennedy all day today, both because it was the 60th anniversary of his death, and because tomorrow will be the first Thanksgiving in years in which I will not get to have a conversation with Kennedy's FCC Chairman, Newton Minow, who passed away in May. \n\nNewt was at that convention, attending as a supporter of Adlai Stevenson, who was running his third campaign for the presidency after losing to Eisenhower twice. Going into the convention, it seemed that Stevenson had a chance. Kennedy was leading in the Gallup polls, but never by much, and he'd just lost the California primary, so a Los Angeles Convention wasn't in his favor. \n\nBut, when it began, enthusiasm for Kennedy ran through the place like wildfire, both because of JFK being one of the great orators of American history, and because Bobby Kennedy was spending his time courting favor for his brother. As Newt would tell it, by the end of the second day, the writing was on the wall. Kennedy would be the nominee, and the party made it official with a vote the next afternoon. He won with a narrow majority of 53%, but the rest of the party soon fell in line, and they set their sights on the tough race ahead as they prepared to go up against a very popular sitting Vice President in Richard Nixon, in what would be one of tightest races in American history. \n\nNewt’s stories were always incredible, but his descriptions of the Convention really had a way of making me feel I’d been there.\n\nPhotos: \n\n• 1.
