        "text": "The property is currently owned by real-estate investor and attorney Leonard Ross, who purchased the mansion in the 1970s. According to Gulf News, Ross has filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy. This form of bankruptcy suspends the repossession of assets such as property while the filing party negotiates with their creditors. The news outlet reports that 74-year-old Ross has accumulated $75 million in liabilities, having tried and failed to sell the property on numerous prior occasions.\n\nBuilt in the 1920s by English-born American architect Gordon Kaufman, who also worked on the Hoover Dam, the sprawling 50,000 square-foot mansion is quite the property. The ‘H’-shaped main house contains an impressive 19 bedrooms, 29 bathrooms, a 50-foot entry hall, two screening rooms, two dining rooms, reception rooms, a billiard room and its own two-floor library. Its 3.7-acre grounds also contain fountains, ponds, a swimming pool and pool house, two tennis courts, a dining area that accommodates 400 and a guest house. Spanish and Italian in style, the mansion’s decor features ornate carved ceilings, paneled walls, parquet floors and an abundance of period features, including fireplaces, French doors and balconies.\n\nThe Los Angeles home was built for Milton Getz, executive director of the Union Bank & Trust Co. It was subsequently owned by Amercian businessman, politician and newspaper magnate, William Randolph Hearst, who developed Hearst Communications. According to the Mail Online, Hearst was gifted the property in 1946 by his mistress, the actress Marion Davies, who purchased the mansion for $120,000. Hearst resided there with Davies until his death in 1951.\n\nOne of the most famous scenes in the 1972 classic The Godfather, in which the character Jack Woltz awakes to find a severed horse head in his bed, was filmed at the property. Ross purchased the mansion around the same time and renovated the home in the 1990s, when it was also used as a location for the 1992 Whitney Houston film, The Bodyguard.\n\nAlthough Ross sought to keep the house afloat by renting it out for events, he has struggled financially for some years. American news outlet The Real Deal reported that Ross had $60 million in debts tied to the property, which he tried to sell for $195 million in September 2016. He then sought to refinance the mansion through crowdfunding, requesting contributions of a minimum of $125,000 per person on the website StartEngine. The scheme proved unsuccessful, as did a subsequent sales attempt for the reduced price of $135 million in September 2018.\n\nGulf News reports that Ross is now embroiled in legal battle with lenders who hold a mortgage on the property. He has filed a lawsuit against the private lenders, whom he claims took advantage of him by convincing him to enter into a mortgage agreement in 2015, shortly after the death of his daughter.\n\nThis legal dispute is, however, on hold for the time being in light of Ross’s bankruptcy filing. According to Gulf News, a hearing for the case is set to take place in the Los Angeles Superior Court on Tuesday.\n\nMore from Tatler"
