        "text": "AIDS Memorial Grove\n\nNancy Pelosi Drive and Bowling Green Drive | Map It\n\nThe National AIDS Memorial Grove is a living tribute to all whose lives have been touched by AIDS, and a dedicated space where people can gather to heal, hope, and remember. Its purpose is to ensure that those who have suffered from the AIDS epidemic — both those who have died and those who have shared their struggle — are not forgotten.\n\nhttps://aidsmemorial.org\n\nAnglers Lodge\n\n1232 John F. Kennedy Drive | Map It\n\nTucked away in the park’s western end, just across from the Bison Paddock, are three serene pools and a rustic mountain-style lodge, home to the Golden Gate Angling and Casting Club. Generations of San Franciscans have learned to fly-fish here, and people come from around the world to participate in tournaments and other events. The pools are open to anyone who would like to practice their casting technique, free of charge, and members are often happy to provide tips.\n\nhttps://www.ggacc.org/\n\nBeach Chalet Visitor Center\n\n1000 Great Highway | Map It\n\nThis 1925 Spanish Revival-style building at the park’s western end, designed by renowned architect Willis Polk, originally housed a lounge and bathing facilities for Ocean Beach swimmers on the ground floor and a restaurant upstairs. The ground floor’s striking WPA frescoes, mosaics, and wood carvings were added in 1936-37 in a project funded by the Works Progress Administration (WPA). Today, the ground floor houses the Golden Gate Park Visitor Center and the Park Chalet restaurant; upstairs is the Beach Chalet restaurant, with sweeping views of the Pacific.\n\nBison Paddock\n\n1237 John F. Kennedy Drive | Map It\n\nVisitors to Golden Gate Park are often astounded to stumble upon a herd of American bison browsing in a meadow in the park’s western end, but these huge, shaggy Great Plains denizens have been a beloved institution since 1892. Before San Francisco opened its first zoo in the 1930s, a menagerie of creatures were kept in Golden Gate Park, including elk, deer, bear, sheep, and bison. The herd’s first home was in the park’s eastern end, but in 1899 they were moved to the meadow where you see them today, just west of Spreckels Lake along John F. Kennedy Drive. The small herd that remains is cared for by the San Francisco Zoo, while Rec and Park gardeners maintain the enclosure. More\n\nConservatory of Flowers\n\n100 John F. Kennedy Drive | Map It\n\nA Victorian confection of wood and glass, the Conservatory of Flowers, which opened in 1879, is the oldest building in Golden Gate Park and one of San Francisco’s most beloved landmarks. It houses some 1,700 species of aquatic and tropical plants, many of them rare, including a 100-year-old giant Imperial philodendron, a world-renowned collection of orchids, giant water lilies, and carnivorous plants. Special exhibits have included such popular favorites as the Butterfly Zone and the miniature garden railroad. Admission to the Conservatory of Flowers is free to San Francisco residents and all veterans.\n\nhttps://gggp.org/conservatory-of-flowers/\n\nJFK Promenade\n\nJFK Drive, from Kezar Drive to Transverse Drive | Map It\n\nThe John F. Kennedy (JFK) Promenade is a 1.5-mile stretch of permanent car-free road enjoyed by a wide range of visitors. Along the route, visitors can enjoy art installations, public pianos, rest stops and enhanced entrances featuring seating and lawn games, and live music in the heart of San Francisco’s majestic Golden Gate Park. It is a place of whimsy, fun and lingering delight.\n\nMore than a dozen massive murals are painted directly upon road, large-scale sculpture installations adorn the mile as creative totems to community solidarity, two grand pianos sit ready for open play, live music permeates the air from two different stages, a beautifully restored vintage caravan pours locally roasted coffee, circus performers emerge and vanish again as organically as the naturally occurring elements, a storyboard walk educates minds young and old on the history of the park, children’s games can be found in plain sight.

The playground, called the Sharon Quarters for Children when it opened in 1888, is thought to have been the nation’s first public playground. In that era, the idea of providing a dedicated space solely for youth recreation was groundbreaking. With generous support from the Koret Foundation, the playground underwent a major renovation and reopened in 2007 as the Koret Children’s Quarter, retaining the park’s popular concrete slides. A charming 1914 Herschell-Spillman Company Carousel offers rides to the young and young-at-heart.\n\nMcLaren Lodge\n\n501 Stanyan Street | Map It\n\nBuilt in 1896, McLaren Lodge was the home of the park department’s fifth superintendent, John McLaren, until 1943. McLaren Lodge is currently both the headquarters for the Recreation and Park Department and an interesting stop for architecture buffs, who often marvel at the intricate construction of the building’s Richardson Romanesque design, which includes exterior walls of 18-inch thick ashlar basalt masonry and sandstone quoins.\n\nMcLaren Lodge is a registered San Francisco landmark (No. 175).\n\nMusic Concourse\n\nMusic Concourse Drive off of MLK Drive | Map It\n\nThe Music Concourse, a landscaped basin between the California Academy of Sciences and the de Young Museum, is a vital civic and cultural space within Golden Gate Park, hosting free concerts on Sundays during the summer and serving as a respite and picnic spot year-round for visitors to nearby cultural facilities.\n\nIlluminate LIVE is a free concert series at the Bandshell that runs from March through mid-November with shows every Wednesday, Friday and Sunday. The free concerts attract more than 250,000 music lovers throughout each season.\n\nPanhandle\n\nStanyan to Baker streets, between Fell and Oak | Map It\n\nThe Golden Gate Park Panhandle is approximately three-quarters of a mile in length, stretching from Stanyan to Baker Streets; and situated between Fell and Oak Streets. The Panhandle contains paths, a basketball court, playground, restrooms, large lawn areas, and a monument to past President McKinley at its east end. The multi-use pathway on the north side of the Panhandle is a popular route for bicyclists traversing across the City.\n\nPortals of the Past\n\nAt Lloyd Lake, off of John F. Kennedy Drive | Map It\n\nThe Portals of the Past is an unusual little monument at Golden Gate Park. Standing on the shores of Lloyd Lake (just to the west of the de Young Museum), these columns actually have an interesting history. During the big earthquake and fire of 1906, most of Nob Hill was flattened by the destruction. However somehow, the entrance way to the mansion of A.N. Towne managed to remain standing. It was later removed and brought over to Golden Gate Park, where it still stands today, as a symbol of the perseverance of San Francisco… working towards an optimistic future, regardless of the tragedy of the past. (Courtesy ofSan Francisco Memories)\n\nPrayer Book Cross\n\nJohn F. Kennedy Drive near Transverse | Map It\n\nOn a steep, 150-foot-high knoll, this 64-foot-tall Celtic cross stands bold to the sky. The tallest monument in the park, it is nicknamed “Plymouth Rock of the Pacific.” Here, above Rainbow Falls at Crossover Drive, it commemorates the first-known use of the Book of Common Prayer in an English-speaking service on North America’s West Coast. The monument, with a span of 23 feet, consists of 68 huge blue Colusa sandstone blocks. Bishop William Ford Nichols, the second Episcopal Bishop of California, dedicated it on January 1st at the opening of the 1894 California Midwinter International Exposition.\n\nSan Francisco Botanical Garden\n\n1199 Ninth Avenue | Map It\n\nThe San Francisco Botanical Garden at Strybing Arboretum grows and conserves plants from around the world — more than 8,000 varieties in 55 acres of landscaped gardens and open spaces. Stroll through a grove of coast redwoods and a Mediterranean garden, explore cloud forests from meso-America and southeast Asia, and wander gardens of flora from Chile, Australia, Japan, California, and more. The garden’s special collections include rhododendrons, camellias, magnolias, and succulents. Admission to the Conservatory of Flowers is free to San Francisco residents and all veterans.\n\nSan Francisco Botanical Garden at Gardens of Golden Gate Park (gggp.org)\n\nWindmills\n\nAt the west end of the park | Map It\n\nOn the far western edge of Golden Gate Park stand two wooden windmills that were built to pump groundwater for irrigating the park’s lawns and gardens, helping to transform the dunes that once covered the area. The North, or Dutch, Windmill was built in 1902, followed by the South, or Murphy, Windmill, completed in 1907. Motorized pumps were first installed in the Dutch Windmill in 1913 to augment the power system, and the Murphy Windmill was electrified soon after. It’s commonly believed that the windmills were taken out of service around 1935. Cosmetic repairs to the Dutch Windmill were completed in 1980, and a renovation of the Murphy Windmill and adjacent Millwright’s Cottage was completed in 2012."
