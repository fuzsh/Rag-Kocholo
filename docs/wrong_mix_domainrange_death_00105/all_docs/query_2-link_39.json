        "text": "Beverly Hills Cop: Axel F is still reigning supreme on Netflix.\n\nEddie Murphy’s latest film spent another week atop the streamer’s Top 10 English-language films with 22.2M views, also making it the most-watched title of the week again. That puts it nearly halfway to a spot on the most popular list, which would require it to beat Glass Onion‘s 136M views to do so.\n\nSecond among English-language films was A Family Affair, which continued to serve up laughs with 11.6M views — a far cry from the No. 3 spot, which was Paw Patrol: The Movie with 4.7M views.\n\nOn the TV side, things have been looking a bit light since Bridgerton is losing steam as more of its audience finishes the third season. Still, its 2.7M views last week was good enough to boost it to sixth place on the most popular list."
