Former Miami Heat player Mike Miller will be at the AmericanAirlines Arena on Friday to pick up his 2013 championship ring according to the Sun-Sentinel.

The Heat have asked fans to arrive early via a tweet signaling that they will provide what should be a special moment for the veteran, who now plays for the Memphis Grizzlies. One theory is that public address announcer Michael Baiamonte will make it seem as if Miller is a current member of the Heat when he introduces him.

Miller played with the Heat from 2010-2013 and won two NBA titles with the team before becoming a casualty of the collective bargaining agreement this past off-season. Miller was waived by the Heat when the team used its amnesty clause. The move allowed Miami to avoid luxury tax penalties that would've been extremely costly. Due to Miller's limited minutes, it became a decision that the Heat needed to make.

Miller was clutch for the Heat and it remains to be seen if his production is missed in the upcoming post-season run for the Heat. In the clinching Game 5 victory over the Oklahoma City Thunder, Miller made seven 3-pointers as the Sentinel pointed out. It was his production in that game that allowed the Heat to pick up their first of two straight NBA titles. In last year's NBA finals against the San Antonio Spurs, Miller sank 9 of his first 10 3-point attempts according to Basketball-Reference.com.

Friday's game is set to start at 7:30 as the Heat will try to rebound after a loss in Boston on Wednesday.
