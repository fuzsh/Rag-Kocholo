        "text": "Allan Houston, the former Knicks assistant general manager and now the GM of the Westchester Knicks, pushed hard to have Mike Miller considered to be the interim coach following David Fizdale’s firing.\n\nHouston has been with Miller since he was hired five seasons ago to coach the G-League team when Phil Jackson was president. Miller successfully ran the triangle for Jackson, then adapted when Jackson was let go.\n\nHouston lost power in the organization once Jackson was hired, but his status might be moving up, especially if president Steve Mills and GM Scott Perry are eventually fired. Houston has watched most of Miller’s G-League games.\n\nLate last season, when Fizdale was asked if he would attempt shore up his staff by hiring a defensive assistant, Fizdale said he thought he was good with what he had. Apparently, the organization disagreed and Miller got the promotion to assistant coach — perhaps with this moment in mind.\n\nCraig Robinson, executive VP of player development, also oversees the Westchester Knicks. Interestingly, both Robinson and Houston traveled with the team to Milwaukee for the 44-point loss.\n\nMiller cobbled together a 108-92 four-season record in Westchester in four seasons.\n\nKnicks rookie RJ Barrett’s percentages have been on the decline and he was particularly awful during the Milwaukee/Denver atrocities. He had fallen below 40 percent — shooting 39.6 percent overall, 30.9 from 3 and 53.3 percent from the line.\n\nBarrett’s game showed a uptick against Indiana as he scored 12 points with three assists and nine rebounds, playing with more energy and wild mammoth driving dunk. But he shot just 4 of 11 and missed three more free throws (3 of 6).\n\n“It happens,’’ Barrett said. “Slumps happen. I wouldn’t even say I’m in a slump. I just didn’t make certain shots that I can make and as the year goes on, watch, I’m going to get hot and you guys are going to be like, ‘Oh, what’s the difference now, you got hot?’”\n\nDamyean Dotson, after dislocating his pinkie Thursday and being in agony on the court for several seconds, returned Saturday against Indiana and pumped in 10 points. … Miller’s promotion didn’t help Allonzo Trier, who remained on the bench Saturday (DNP-CD)."
