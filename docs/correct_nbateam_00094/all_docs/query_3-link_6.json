Miller (born August 14, 1964) is an American basketball coach who is an assistant coach for the Washington Wizards of the National Basketball Association (NBA).\n\nMiller was born on August 14, 1964, in Monmouth, Illinois,[1][2] and graduated from Monmouth High School where he was a standout basketball player where the Monmouth \"Zippers\" finished second in the 1982 state championship game. He played college basketball at Burlington Junior College (now Southeastern Community College) in Burlington, Iowa and East Texas State University (now Texas A&M University–Commerce).[3] At East Texas State, he was a member of the team that won the Lone Star Conference championship in 1984. He graduated from East Texas State in 1987.[1]\n\nMiller began his coaching career as an assistant coach Cistercian Prep School in Irving, Texas in 1987. He was an assistant football and baseball coach, and the head coach of the JV basketball team his first year. The next year, he was head coach of the varsity basketball team, and left the following year to join the college ranks as an assistant at Western Illinois University, where he coached from 1989–90. The following season, Miller was an assistant coach at Sam Houston State.[4]\n\nFrom 1991 to 1994, Miller was an assistant coach at Southwest Texas State (now Texas State) under Jim Wooldridge, where he helped Southwest Texas State achieve an NCAA tournament appearance and school record 25 wins in the 1993–94 season.[4]\n\nAt age 29, Miller was promoted as head coach at Southwest Texas State in 1994 and was the second youngest NCAA Division I head coach that year.[4] As head coach, Miller led Southwest Texas State to the Southland Conference regular season and conference tournament titles and an NCAA tournament appearance in 1996–97, for which he won Coach of the Year honors from the Southland.[4][5] Southwest Texas State finished second in the Southland standings in 1997–98 and won another regular season title in 1998–99.[4] Miller also coached center/power forward Jeff Foster, who would be a 1999 NBA first-round draft selection and play his entire 13-season career with the Indiana Pacers.[4] In six seasons as head coach at Southwest Texas State, Miller had an 87–79 record.[5]\n\nIn 2000, Miller reunited with Wooldridge, this time as associate head coach at Kansas State, where he would remain for five seasons.[4][6]\n\nMiller had his second head coaching job at Eastern Illinois from 2005 to 2012, during which he went 75–130. His only winning season there was in 2009–10 when Eastern Illinois went 19–12.[5] Following a 12–17 season, Eastern Illinois decided on February 27, 2012 not to renew Miller's contract that was to expire April 30.[7][8]\n\nIn 2012–13, Miller was an assistant at UC Riverside, for his third assistant coaching job under Wooldridge.[9]\n\nIn October 2013, Miller was named an assistant coach at the Austin Toros of the NBA D-League (now G League).[10]\n\nOn October 7, 2015, the D-League's Westchester Knicks hired him to be their head coach.[11] While with the Knicks, Miller won the NBA G League Coach of the Year for the 2017–18 season.[12] After four seasons in Westchester, during which he went 108–92,[13] Miller was promoted to the New York Knicks as an assistant coach.[14]\n\nMiller was named the Knicks' interim head coach on December 6, 2019.[15][16]\n\nHe joined the Oklahoma City Thunder as an assistant coach for the 2020–21 season,[17] later joining the Washington Wizards in the same role the following season.[18]\n\nStatistics overview Season Team Overall Conference Standing Postseason Southwest Texas State Bobcats (Southland Conference) (1994–2000) 1994–95 Southwest Texas State 12–14 7–11 T–7th 1995–96 Southwest Texas State 11–15 7–11 T–7th 1996–97 Southwest Texas State 16–13 10–6 T–1st NCAA Division I Round of 64 1997–98 Southwest Texas State 17–11 10–6 T–2nd 1998–99 Southwest Texas State 19–9 13–5 1st 1999–2000 Southwest Texas State 12–17 8–10 T–6th Southwest Texas State: 87–79 (.524) 55–49 (.529) Eastern Illinois Panthers (Ohio Valley Conference) (2005–2012) 2005–06 Eastern Illinois 6–21 5–15 9th 2006–07 Eastern Illinois 10–20 6–14 5th 2007–08 Eastern Illinois 7–22 6–14 9th 2008–09 Eastern Illinois 12–18 8–10 7th 2009–10 Eastern Illinois 19–12 11–7 T–3rd 2010–11 Eastern Illinois 9–20 4–14 9th 2011–12 Eastern Illinois 12–17 5–11 10th Eastern Illinois: 75–130 (.366) 45–85 (.346) Total: 162–209 (.437)\n\nNational champion Postseason invitational champion\n\nConference regular season champion Conference regular season and conference tournament champion\n\nDivision regular season champion Division regular season and conference tournament champion\n\nConference tournament champion\n\nLegend Regular season G Games coached W Games won L Games lost W–L % Win–loss % Playoffs PG Playoff games PW Playoff wins PL Playoff losses PW–L % Playoff win–loss %\n\nTeam Year G W L W–L% Finish PG PW PL PW–L% Result Westchester 2015–16 50 28 22 .560 2nd in Atlantic 2 0 2 .000 Lost quarterfinals Westchester 2016–17 50 19 31 .380 T–3rd in Atlantic – – – – Missed playoffs Westchester 2017–18 50 32 18 .640 1st in Atlantic 1 0 1 .000 Lost semifinals Westchester 2018–19 50 29 21 .580 T–2nd in Atlantic 2 1 1 .500 Lost semifinals Career 200 108 92 .540 5 1 4 .200\n\nLegend Regular season G Games coached W Games won L Games lost W–L % Win–loss % Playoffs PG Playoff games PW Playoff wins PL Playoff losses PW–L % Playoff win–loss %"
