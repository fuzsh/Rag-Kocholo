        "text": "Calm, cool, cold-blooded.\n\nMany NBA fans identify Mike Miller as the player that came off the bench to hit seven 3-pointers -- after not making any in the previous four games -- for the Miami Heat in a Game 5 NBA Finals Championship-clinching win in 2012. The next year, he buried a 3-pointer wearing one shoe to help lead Miami to a come-from-behind win over the San Antonio Spurs to force Game 7 in the NBA Finals.\n\nAnd looking back at the 20th anniversary of his draft night, he approached a legendary night in Mitchell sports history with the same cool demeanor.\n\nAt 20 years old, two years removed from graduating from Mitchell High School, Miller navigated the NBA Draft process with the savvy of a 10-year veteran. Ultimately, it resulted in being taken by the Orlando Magic with the fifth overall pick on June 28, 2000.\n\n“I don’t think there are many jitters. I’ve done as much as I possibly can,” Miller told then-Mitchell Republic reporter Joel Reinesch the day before the draft. “I went and worked out for (interested NBA teams), so it’s all in their hands. It’s not even worth stressing about. If I stress, it’s not going to get me picked any sooner.”\n\nMiller’s NBA Draft dreams started long before that night in Minneapolis. As Miller lit up the Corn Palace, leading the Kernels to two Class A state championships, the end goal was always to reach the NBA, despite Rapid City Stevens alum Eric Piatkowski being the lone player to play high school basketball in South Dakota to be taken in the first round of the NBA Draft.\n\nThe kid nicknamed Skinny quickly bulked up and averaged 12.2 points and 5.2 rebounds as a freshman for the University of Florida in 1998-1999, vaulting him to projections of being a top-20 pick if he chose to enter the draft after his sophomore season.\n\n“All the years (in grade school) it was just a kid having a dream,” said Ernie Kuyper, Miller’s cousin and former Mitchell teammate. “When I was like, ‘Wow, this could really happen’ was when he went to Florida. His dad and I pull up the computer -- which was dial-up back then -- and we’d look, he’d be on the draft board and we couldn’t believe it.”\n\nEntering the draft\n\nThe Gators entered the 1999-2000 ranked No. 8 in the country and the Miller family opted for a safety net in case high expectations were dimmed. Miller took out a disability insurance policy which provided a financial cushion if he suffered an injury that impacted future draft status or earnings while playing for Florida.\n\nInstead, however, the Gators won a share of the Southeastern Conference regular season championship and were the first team in program history to be ranked wire-to-wire during the season. Florida would also advance to the NCAA Championship game, aided by Miller’s first-round buzzer beater against Butler that has become an iconic highlight shown every year amid March Madness.\n\nThe Gators were expected to return most of their firepower, with Miller as the centerpiece, the following season, but he had other plans.\n\n“(Florida coach) Billy Donovan came to talk to us after the championship game and said Mike’s a possible first-round pick, but could use another year or so,” said Tom Miller, Mike’s father. “I said, ‘I would agree with that. He’ll be much better next year.’ Following that, Mike had some inside information and said, ‘I think I’m going to the draft. It’s a good year.’ I said, ‘Are you sure?’”\n\nMiller’s decision may have been finalized after the season, but he had hinted toward entering the draft in private conversations with Kuyper during the season, saying he wanted to go to the Final Four in Indianapolis to the draft in Minneapolis.\n\n“You can go back to his press conference (at Mitchell) when he picked Florida,” said Ryan Miller, Mike’s older brother. “He basically said he was going to Florida to help change the program and hopefully declare for the draft early. To his credit and a lot of hard work, he was able to make those dreams happen. The team helped him, he had great teammates and put himself in position to be a lottery pick.”\n\nPreparing for the pros\n\nThe Miller family, known to be tight-knit and basketball intelligent, left most of the pre-draft process up to Mike, his then-agent Arn Tellem -- now the vice chairman of the Detroit Pistons -- and the Florida coaching staff.\n\nMiller only participated in a handful of workouts -- twice for Orlando -- but his father was satisfied with the team Mike had built around him during the draft process, despite going from college student to becoming an NBA name more than 1,500 miles from home.\n\n“I had to rely on Billy Donovan because he was there when the agents came in,” Tom Miller said. “He said (Tellem) would be the best one for Mike and I said, ‘OK.’ … Most coaches try to help their kids make the best decisions moving forward.”\n\nHis father’s instincts proved accurate as Miller’s draft stock continued to rise and he began to see projections in the top-10 in most mock drafts leading up to the draft. In the week of the draft, Reinesch reported that Miller was gaining serious interest from the Hawks -- who held the No. 6 pick -- after working out in Atlanta less than a week prior to the draft.\n\nThe top-three picks were essentially solidified before teams arrived at the NBA Draft in Minneapolis, with Cincinnati big man Kenyon Martin being considered a lock to be taken with the No. 1 pick by the New Jersey Nets. Stromile Swift, an athletic post player from LSU, went No. 2 to Vancouver and would eventually become a teammate of Miller’s when the Grizzlies relocated to Memphis. Prep-to-pros wing Darius Miles went No. 3 to the Los Angeles Clippers, but the rest of the top-10 appeared murky.\n\nHaving known Miller since their days at Mitchell, Reinesch was still impressed by his ability to navigate the draft process, despite Miller having spent his high school years entertaining the likes of Bob Knight and Rick Majerus at the Corn Palace during his recruitment. It was a pre-draft conversation with DePaul guard Quentin Richardson -- and fellow 2000 first round pick -- that Reinesch realized how big Miller had become on the basketball circuit.\n\n“I told (him) who I was and I get no more than E-R out of my mouth when Richardson goes, ‘It’s Miller time, baby!’” said Reinesch, who is now a professor at Dakota Wesleyan University. “You could tell he had this affinity for Mike. … When Quentin Richardson was so enthused to talk about him like that, I was like, ‘I think Mike actually belongs.’ Obviously he did, but you knew the family. It was hard to put him in the context of being a lottery draft pick in the NBA.”\n\nMiller’s confidence was shared by Ryan, who had returned to the United States for three days while on break from playing professionally in Australia. Ryan Miller was not concerned about the potential of sliding down the draft board after receiving intel that his brother would likely fall no further than the ninth pick, held by the Houston Rockets.\n\n“Talking to people in the business and agents, we didn’t think he’d go any farther than No. 9,” said Ryan Miller, who currently serves as assistant head coach for Texas Christian University. “As long as he was going to get picked and as long as he was going to have the opportunity, that was the biggest thing. There was a lot of buzz with his workouts. We had a pretty good idea that it wasn’t going to be a long process on draft day.”\n\nNaturally playing the role of excited and concerned father, Tom Miller did not share the same calmness as his sons. He may not have had to prepare them for any notions of a draft-day slide, but he wanted to make sure he was prepared for anything that could happen.\n\n“I had to prepare myself and said, ‘Let’s see how this goes,’” Tom said. “Because some players (slid) and some didn’t. I was shocked that he went that early and that’s always a good feeling.”\n\nComing off the board\n\nMoments after the Nets selected Martin, Orlando made a deal with the Clippers that would send Miles to the Magic in return for the fifth and 10th overall picks. The trade, however, was contingent on Iowa State forward Marcus Fizer being available at No. 5. When the Chicago Bulls took Fizer at No. 4, the trade was nixed and Orlando was on the clock.\n\nThe Magic were still two months away from acquiring all-stars Tracy McGrady and Grant Hill in free agency. So the franchise led by second-year head coach Doc Rivers took a chance on the South Dakota swingman, allowing him to continue his career less than two hours from Gainesville.\n\n“That’s where I wanted to go from the beginning,” Miller said on draft night. “This is the place I wanted to end up. Orlando was what I had my eye on and I’ve just got to thank them for having faith to choose me with the fifth pick.”\n\nThe entire Miller clan was in attendance, while buses of Mitchell fans and friends made the trip to the Target Center. After spending a life devoted to basketball -- which still continues for many of them -- Mike’s selection was the payoff.\n\n“Having something like that happen is so rare and so unique,” Ryan Miller said. “... Our family was basketball, family, education and church in no particular order, but basketball was right there. It was one of the most important things in our lives, and to have my brother reach the pinnacle, is something unique and a memory you’ll never forget.”\n\nRevisiting the picks 20 years later\n\nMiller would go on to win the NBA Rookie of the Year after averaging 14.7 points and 4.9 rebounds during the 2000-2001 season as Orlando reached the playoffs.\n\nBut the 2000 NBA Draft class has been maligned by fans and basketball analysts as time passed, with only three of the 60 players taken making an NBA All-Star Game and Milwaukee Bucks sharpshooter Michael Redd was the lone player to be selected to an all-NBA squad during his career.\n\nLike Redd, Miller is in the elite minority as his career lasted 1,032 games over 17 seasons, with an NBA Sixth Man of the Year award and two NBA titles. Only Jamal Crawford -- No. 8 pick -- played more games (1,326) and seasons (19) than Miller in the class of 2000.\n\nMiller has stood out among draft picks from that year, and 20 years later, remains the gold standard for South Dakota basketball players with NBA aspirations.\n\n“I think it gave (South Dakota) kids hope,” Kuyper said. “‘If Mike Miller from Mitchell, South Dakota, can do this, I can do it.’ It gave them confidence, it gave them hope, which is what you want in life. I think it was great for the state. … I hope there are more kids like Mike that get out there and get opportunities.”"
