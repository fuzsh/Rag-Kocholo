        "text": "Mike MIller's biggest priority as the Houston High basketball coach is to develop his players and get them ready for the next level, he said.\n\nThat means getting four-star LSU signee Jerrell Colbert ready for the SEC. The 6-foot-9, 215 pound center is the top prospect in the state and No. 63 overall in the nation according to the 247Sports Composite.\n\n\"His ceiling is incredibly high. When he’s playing with energy and flying around there’s nothing like him around here to be honest with you,\" Miller said. \"He can contest shots, can knock down threes, skilled enough to make plays in transition, two, three, four, five dribbles. He’s a really good passer. Just an unbelievable talent.\"\n\nGetting ready for the PAC-12: Johnathan Lawson: Playing with 3 future DI players is 'getting me prepared' for Oregon\n\nBigger, stronger, more aggressive: Creighton basketball commitment Mason Miller of Houston demonstrates new strength in win\n\nMiller said that Colbert's game reminds him of former Grizzlies forward Brendan Wright, who starred at Brentwood Academy and North Carolina before playing 10 seasons in the NBA.\n\n\"I would say he's like a better-shooting version of like a Brendan Wright,\" Miller said. \"He plays a lot like him. He's wiry, he's skilled. He can rebound and block shots. He has a lot of that in him because of his body type.\"\n\nColbert, who is originally from Houston, Texas, transferred to Houston High from Karen Wagner High in San Antonio.\n\n\"I moved closer to family, that's why I moved up here,\" Colbert said.\n\nHe said that his biggest strengths are his defense and rebounding. He said that he's working on his post moves and that his dropstep is his go-to move. And he's adjusting to playing with several Division I prospects at Houston including Creighton commitment Mason Miller and Oregon commitment Johnathan Lawson.\n\n\"We play really well together already, this is one of the best teams I've played with as a team so that's very cool. And we all share the ball very well, which is new to me and I love it,\" said Colbert.\n\nMiller pointed out that coaching so many talented players has its difficulties as well. Many of them were used to being the star players on their previous team. Now they're having to adapt to playing with each other in a situation that Miller says is closer to what college basketball will be like for them.\n\n\"A coach is only as good as his players and I have a lot of great players. The biggest challenge is keeping them all happy and understanding this is what it’s like playing college basketball,\" Miller said. \"You’re not always going to have the ball in your hand, you’re not always going to be the guy who has the play called for you, you’re not always going to be the guy who shoots 15 shots. That’s what you expect.\""
