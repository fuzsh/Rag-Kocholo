        "text": "How Mike Miller ended up signing with the Miami Heat: “The hard stuff was getting CB, DW, and LB together, that was easy for me. Got on the phone with Udonis, and me and UD thought it was the worth the sacrifice to come back here. He got to stay home and I got to kind of come back here to Florida so it worked out great for all of us.” What he turned down to come play in Miami: “A lot of money… But hopefully it will be worth it. So far so good but time will tell if it was worth it. I think it will be but I know that there is a lot of work to do between now and then.”\n\nIn a pregame media availability on Friday, Cheryl Miller ripped the league’s record new broadcast rights package and the negotiators who put it together. Miller called for a number four-times higher than the reported $2.2 billion over 11 years that the WNBA reportedly will receive starting in 2025. The new deal could be as much as six-times higher than the current deal struck in 2016. “I’m not great with numbers,” Miller told reporters in Phoenix. “That’s a lowball.”\n\nIn the USC legend and longtime basketball voice’s view, the NBA and its broadcast partners undervalued the WNBA in negotiations. “We certainly have come a long way, and I’m not about gauging, but it’s a long time overdue,” Miller said. “Women’s basketball is in a great place right now.” The NBA negotiated the new deals on behalf of the WNBA, as they have with each package since the women’s league was created nearly three decades ago."
