        "text": "Former Florida Gator basketball player Mike Miller has signed a two year deal with the Denver Nuggets worth in excess of $5 million.\n\nMiller was one of the first huge coups for long time Gators head coach Billy Donovan, choosing Florida because of the opportunity to build a program. Miller led the Gators to the 2000 NCAA championship game before losing to Michigan State. Shortly after the loss, Miller declared for the NBA draft.\n\nMiller was chosen with the fifth overall pick in the 2000 NBA draft by the Orlando Magic and won the 2001 NBA Rookie of the Year.\n\nMiller has had a journeyman’s career in the NBA, having never been the go-to guy, but success has seemed to follow him. From 2011 to 2015 Miller appeared in five straight NBA finals, and winning two.\n\nFor his career Miller has averaged 10.8 points per game, 4.3 rebounds per game, and 2.6 assists per game, while playing for Orlando, Memphis (twice), Minnesota, Washington, Miami, Cleveland, and Dever."
