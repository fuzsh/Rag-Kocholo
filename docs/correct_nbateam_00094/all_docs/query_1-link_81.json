        "text": "Mike Miller arrived at Heat training camp, still sore from hernia surgery, and couldn't believe what he saw. In the video room and on the floor, the Heat was putting in sets and plays that fit his game, sets and plays that – once he healed – would give him a shot to play basketball again, rather than just waiting to shoot from the corner.\n\n\"Excitement,\" Miller recalled his reaction. \"I don't think people realize how hard it is to play when you're just standing in one spot all the time.\"\n\nSince his return, Miller has begun making his wait worth it, playing much more aggressively and efficiently. Still, Erik Spoelstra made Heat fans wait for something else: the deployment of the five-man lineup, featuring Miller and Udonis Haslem with the three stars, that had been so effective in closing out the Eastern Conference Finals. Spoelstra made them wait until 8:07 remained in Friday's game against the 76ers and, during a 15-0 run that turned a tight contest into a 99-79 rout, they collectively made you wonder why the coach had waited so long.\n\n\"I had that lineup on my card for a while,\" Spoelstra said.\n\nSpoelstra, even while wanting more size against one of the league's most active squads, wasn't planning to keep that lineup on the court even as long as he did. But, with LeBron James deftly handling point guard duties, Dwyane Wade slicing to the rim, and Miller and Haslem sinking jumpers, and he had no choice.\n\nThe 76ers?\n\nWell, they had no answers.\n\n\"They just overwhelmed us,\" Philadelphia coach Doug Collins said of the Heat.\n\nThe 76ers had some open looks, for sure, but they still finished the night looking as lost as in so many of the recent meetings against the Heat. Miami (17-6) is just one game ahead of Philadelphia (16-7) in the Eastern Conference standings, but the actual gap is far more gaping. The Heat has won 12 of 13 in the series, including the first round of the 2011 playoffs, and won this one even while missing its first 10 shots of the third quarter, and just two nights after collapsing in the second half against Milwaukee.\n\nFollowing that embarrassment, the Heat held an unusually long practice Thursday, consisting not only of video instruction, but also of frank conversation between players and coaches.\n\n\"No holds barred,\" James said.\n\n\"We had to speak the truth,\" Spoelstra said. \"We had to correct some things.\"\n\n\"The biggest thing (Thursday), the lines of communication were open,\" Wade said.\n\nThe biggest thing Friday?\n\n\"We did what we talked about,\" Wade said.\n\nIt wasn't necessarily easy early, especially for James, the Eastern Conference Player of the Month, who struggled to shake Andre Iguodala. Norris Cole, with his first cousin Trent Cole (of the Philadelphia Eagles) seeing him play in person for the first time, provided some scoring off the pine, and Miami kept the turnovers down to take a 51-47 lead into halftime.\n\nJames scored the final eight points of the third quarter to take a 67-63 lead into the fourth.\n\nThen Spoelstra did something different.\n\nHe left James in to start the fourth. Three-pointers from Cole and Miller helped extend the lead to 10. Then it was eight. Then a timeout. Then out came the Big 5, but not before James told his four courtmates not to squander the rare opportunity.\n\n\"That's the lineup we all came here to play,\" said Wade, who led with 26 points.\n\nSpoelstra hadn't played it yet. He hadn't played it because, unlike last season, he had two viable point guards. He hadn't played it because he has been trying to work in Shane Battier. He hadn't played it because he wasn't sure Miller was ready for extended action.\n\nAnd then he did.\n\n\"It was a shock to everybody,\" said Miller, who shot 5-of-7, and scored 12.\n\nIt will be a shock if we don't see it again. Soon.\n\nNoteworthy: James Jones, who hasn't played more than four minutes in any of the past six games, has changed course and decided to defend his Three-Point Contest crown. The event is part of All-Star Saturday night on Feb. 25 in Orlando. A fan, wearing a Charles Barkley T-shirt, was escorted from his seat after cursing at James during the national anthem."
