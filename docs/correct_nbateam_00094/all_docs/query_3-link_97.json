        "text": "INDIANAPOLIS -- In high school, Mike Miller played basketball in an arena made of corn. He went to college at Florida to play for a program built on dreams.\n\nIt took guts for the All-American player from Mitchell, S.D., to take the chance he did. Kansas, Kentucky, and several other big-name programs were begging him to come.\n\nBut Miller chose Florida, a struggling program with no tradition and, some thought, no hope -- just a young, eager coach who saw the resources at Florida and had trouble believing basketball wouldn't work there.\n\n''Some people said I was selling the guy a pipe dream,'' Florida coach Billy Donovan said. ''I don't think I was selling him a pipe dream. I was selling him something I believed in.''\n\nMiller believed, too. And now, the Gators are in the Final Four. They arrived in Indianapolis on Thursday to prepare for Saturday's game against North Carolina.\n\n''I took a lot of criticism,'' Miller said. ''But that's part of making a sacrifice. My sacrifice was to come here and to take all the negative publicity from the people who thought I was throwing it away.''\n\nLabeled as the cornerstone of Donovan's rebuilding project, Miller lent legitimacy to a program that had enjoyed pockets of success but never anything sustained.\n\nStill, when he made the decision, South Dakotans had trouble hiding their dismay.\n\n''Some people were quietly disappointed,'' said Miller's father, Tom. ''They were hoping to see him more and some of them thought he might be better\n\nserved going to a bigger-name school.''\n\nMiller's high school coach, Gary Munsen, said people were ''shocked'' by the decision.\n\n''It was like, why Florida?'' he said.\n\nAnd why not Kansas, Iowa or Kentucky? All were within a long day's drive and all were places where parents, friends and neighbors could still be part of the hometown hero's success.\n\nThat's the kind of town Mitchell is. Located 70 miles west of Sioux Falls, the city of 14,000 takes its basketball seriously, even though all the games -- boys, girls and those of the area college -- are played at a place called the Corn Palace.\n\n''Every kid in Mitchell dreams of playing in the Corn Palace,'' Miller said. ''You kind of have to see it to believe it.''\n\nHuge corn mosaics adorn the walls, inside and out.\n\nThe pictures depict scenes from America's agricultural heritage. They change every season. So do the basketball players, none of whom has made a bigger impression than Miller.\n\n''I've had some good ones,'' Munsen said. ''There's no doubt he was the best.''\n\nIt's something Donovan and assistant coach John Pelphrey recognized as early as when Miller was in junior high. That's when the coaches, then at Marshall, headed for the Great Plains.\n\nInstead of ''recruiting'' Miller, they built a relationship with him.\n\nDonovan moved to Florida and, coming off 13- and 14-win seasons, he pulled off one of the biggest coups of the recruiting season.\n\nKansas coach Roy Williams was among those who accused him of recruiting violations, figuring Donovan must have cheated to bring one of the best players in the country to a program considered one of the most beleaguered.\n\nBut nobody ever proved Donovan cheated. And Donovan, knowing the relationship he and Pelphrey had built, doesn't think it was such a reach for Miller to head south.\n\n''All I did was talk to him openly and honestly throughout the whole thing,'' Donovan said. ''There were probably some things he didn't like to hear. There were probably some things he did like to hear. It was more of a relationship where I was able to talk to him, to his family, to make him feel more comfortable.''\n\nAs expected, Miller arrived last season and Florida got better, making the round of 16. Still, the most highly touted recruit in Florida history has never been one to light up the scoreboard.\n\nHe's averaged 13 points and six rebounds over two years and has only scored more than 20 points four times.\n\nAt times, he's almost invisible on the court. But in some ways, Pelphrey says, that's the strength of his game. He doesn't try to force things when his game is off. Then, he can strike.\n\nLike when he grabbed 18 rebounds in a home win over Kentucky this year. Or on that last-second shot that saved the first-round game against Butler. He had 16 points and 13 rebounds in that game.\n\n''His feel for the game is what sets him apart,'' Pelphrey said. ''A lot of times, the stats don't tell the tale of Mike Miller. Just having him out there gives guys enormous confidence. There's a lot of substance to the person and to his game.''\n\nAnd thanks to Miller, there's more substance to Florida's basketball program, as well."
