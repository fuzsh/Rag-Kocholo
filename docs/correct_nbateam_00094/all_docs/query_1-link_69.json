        "text": "Update: No decision has been made following LeBron's meeting with Pat Riley.\n\nLeBron James hasn't spoken with any teams about his free agency as of Wednesday morning, but he apparently has reached out to two veteran free agents to gauge their interest in joining him if he decides to leave the Miami Heat, reports Yahoo! Sports Adrian Wojnarowski. One of those free agents was forward Mike Miller, who won two titles in Miami.\n\nThe Cleveland Cavaliers, in their pursuit of James, have been interested in bringing on Miller, Ray Allen and James Jones, three former teammates and friends of James. He could be swayed by discussing his future with his friends, but how much should we take away from this report?\n\nWhy it makes sense\n\nJames has taken his time in getting away from all the noise, and his first contact with a team will come on Wednesday, when he'll sit down with the Heat. Suitors outside Miami have found James hard to reach, but he also hasn't played a role in determining how the Heat attack this free agency period. He knows that once his meetings with teams kick up, it'll be a hectic schedule. It's good for James to tell other free agents not to agree to new contracts until they know what he's about to do -- if they want to join him, that is.\n\nThat James reached out to Miller holds a bit of speculative value, however. Miller, who is well-liked by James, was amnestied by the Heat before this past season, then played for the Memphis Grizzlies. Those believing the whispers of James having a bit of grumpiness about the Heat's handling of its roster -- Miller especially -- could believe this is an important piece of information.\n\nWhy it should be taken with a grain of salt\n\nOf course James is going to go over his options with his friends. Wojnarowski stressed the \"if\" in this news to point out that James could simply be giving due diligence to the free agency process. He'll want to gauge other players' interests in joining him. Nothing is out of the ordinary about James talking to other players, and there's no reason to believe it hints toward his line of thought.\n\nJames has appeared to enter his two runs through free agency with an open mind. That's all his reaching out could mean.\n\nLikelihood"
