        "text": "EMERSON, Ga. — Five-star forward Ziaire Williams always has been a fan of LeBron James, from James' years with the Cleveland Cavaliers, to the Miami Heat, back to Cleveland and now the Los Angeles Lakers.\n\nBut with that fandom – which he described as die-hard – comes another type of loyalty.\n\n\"As a LeBron fan, especially when he was in Miami, you have to be a Mike Miller fan, too,\" said Williams, a 2020 recruit. \"So when he first texted me, I was like, 'No way, that's Coach Mike.'\"\n\nMiller and James played four seasons together in the NBA between the Miami Heat and Cleveland Cavaliers, winning back-to-back titles as teammates in 2012 and 2013.\n\nIn fact, Williams noted the sequence in which Miller hit a 3-point shot while missing his shoe in Game 6 of the 2013 NBA Finals as one of the most memorable moments he had watching basketball growing up. The highlight of the shot, which was assisted by James, is pinned at the top of Miller's Twitter page.\n\n\"Mike was a great player, and not just in the NBA,\" Williams said. \"He was a great player at Florida, too.\"\n\nConnecting with Ziaire Williams\n\nMiller and Williams originally connected over social media, when the former NBA sharpshooter followed him on both Instagram and Twitter.\n\nSoon after, the Tigers assistant coach sent the five-star wing a direct message with a note about his style.\n\n\"At first he just told me what's up, that he watched my game, and that he wants to catch up with me,\" Williams said.\n\nBut it wasn't long before the initial small talk turned into recruiting conversations about how the 6-foot-7 wing would fit in with the Tigers, and a relationship between the recruit and assistant formed.\n\nFor now, Miller is the only one on the Tigers' coaching staff who talks to the 2020 star.\n\n\"It's not even like (Miller) is a coach,\" Williams said. \"We can talk about anything. We actually FaceTime. He's the only coach that FaceTimes me, which is dope. He calls and we talk like two or three times a week.\"\n\n\"He's been in our position before, so when he talks to us, he knows how to relate,\" Williams added.\n\nIt's easy to see why Memphis and several other schools want to get in early on the California prospect, who has torn up the Nike EYBL circuit through eight games, averaging 26.5 points per game for the Oakland Soldiers.\n\nWilliams' average scoring output is the fifth-highest of any player on the Nike circuit, and it includes 36- and 33-point performances.\n\nThe five-star recruit is slotted at No. 19 overall in 247Sports' composite rankings, and No. 5 in California.\n\nHe was also the teammate of fellow Memphis target Jalen Green before Green left the Oakland Soldiers to join Russell Westbrook's Team WhyNot last week.\n\n\"Mike tells me all the time that I'm very versatile and that he thinks that I'm a player that can make it to the next level,\" Williams said. \"He said he is a guy that could help get me there.\"\n\nWhat's next for Ziaire Williams?\n\nSince April 2018, Williams has piled up scholarship offers from Southern California, UCLA, Virginia, Arizona, North Carolina, and, most recently, Memphis.\n\nHe does not have a list of schools that he is considering, but he intends to come up with an initial group at the end of the summer. He already has taken unofficial visits to Stanford and North Carolina.\n\n\"(The list) will come down to relationships and how comfortable me and my family are with me going there,\" Williams said. \"If they feel like there's a realistic scenario of me going there, then I'll take a visit, but it's going to come down to the connections.\"\n\nRECRUITING: Four-star guard Lester Quinones signs with Penny Hardaway, Memphis basketball"
