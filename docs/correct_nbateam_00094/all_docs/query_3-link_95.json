        "text": "MONMOUTH - Mark Twain once said, “Find a job you enjoy doing, and you will never have to work a day in your life.”\n\nThat’s how Monmouth native Mike Miller feels in his fourth season of coaching in the NBA Developmental League.\n\nHe spent his first two years as an assistant coach with the Austin Spurs and he’s currently in his second season with the Westchester Knicks.\n\n“I do consider myself very fortunate to get to do the things I’ve been able to do,” Miller said. “It is something that I certainly enjoy. I don’t feel like I’ve worked a day in my life.\n\n\"It just continues to build.”\n\nMany Monmouth sports fans still remember Miller as a key player for the Monmouth High School’s 1982 state runner- up basketball team.\n\nMiller has over 25 years of coaching experience. He spent nine years at Texas State - six as a head coach - five years at Kansas State and seven years at Eastern Illinois University.\n\n“The opportunity with the Knicks came up and I was very fortunate,” he said. “It is a first-class organization and they treat everyone very well. We are under the same roof as the (New York) Knicks every day and practice in the same facility. We are face-to-face every day with the Knicks players and staff. We have the Knicks players frequently practice with and and playing with us.”\n\nEarlier this season, Miller coached former Rock Island High School star Chasson Randle before he was brought up to play for the Philadelphia 76ers. Miller said Randle was the leading\n\nscorer on the team and the one was the go to player during crunch time. “He (Randle) was a big part of our team,” Miller said. “We hit a tough stretch after he left.”\n\nMiller said he and the Westchester Knicks play close to 50 games a season. They carry a 10-player roster and sometimes play four games in a week in four different\n\ncities. He loads up his IPad with movies for all the traveling to other cities like Dallas, Fort Wayne and Salt Lake City.\n\n“It’s all over the place,' he said.\n\nMiller knows his role as a D-League coach and is proud to say that he’s had four players called up to the NBA. He’s there to develop players for that next level.\n\n“It’s not a destination league,” Miller said. “The difficulty is that the roster changes a lot. Guys are coming over here and they are trying to advance their careers.\n\n“They have to prove themselves. We have a number of guys who have been there for two or three years and they get another contract.\n\n\"They come to us, trying to work their way back. The majority of the NBA players who make it go through a lot of hardship before they get that opportunity. A lot of the guys come in on minimal guaranteed contracts.\n\n\"They aren’t the five-year multi, multi-million-dollar contracts you read about.”\n\nMiller also has the opportunity to coach his son Joey who is a backup point guard for the Westchester Knicks. Joey, 23, played professionally in Italy for a year before landing a\n\nspot for the Knicks’ D-League team. “Joey was here practicing and was able to move into a spot as a backup guard,” he said.\n\nAs a coach, the 52-year-old Miller is soaking in a lot. He gets to see how the New York Knicks run their practices and continue to learn from them on a\n\ndaily basis. He’ll watch the Knicks play a home game at Madison Square Garden on his off night - like last year when Kobe Bryant and the Lakers came to town.\n\nMiller still makes it back to Monmouth occasionally to see family and he has a home in Dallas, Texas. He’s become a big fan of New York style pizza and clam\n\nchowder, but he still mentions the pizza at Italian Village in Monmouth."
