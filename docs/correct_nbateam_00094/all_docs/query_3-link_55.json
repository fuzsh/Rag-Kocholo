        "text": "Mike Miller, the Mitchell (S.D.) native and Denver Nuggets swingman, stood next to a practice court at the Sanford Pentagon on Saturday, a cacophony of bouncing basketballs almost drowning out his voice, and considered what keeps him coming back to Sioux Falls to participate in the Sanford Legends for Kids basketball clinic.\n\n“It’s home,” he said.\n\nThis is the third year in a row that Miller has come to Sioux Falls to appear at the clinic, and in 2016, he’s doing it on the heels of perhaps the best year for basketball in the history of the state, at least at the collegiate level. The Augustana men won the Division II national championship; USD won the Women’s National Invitation tournament; South Dakota State’s men and women both made the NCAA tournament, and the Jackrabbit women, led by Miller’s cousin, Macy, almost got to the Sweet 16.\n\nWith strong years from USF, Dakota Wesleyan and Mount Marty as well, the state’s standing on the national basketball scene has rarely been higher.\n\n“It was just a matter of time,” Miller said. “I think basketball in South Dakota has always been fantastic. What you plant grows, right? And to see organizations like this, (with) how young (the kids) are, start building those fundamentals, building a nice structure, and as you plant that, it grows up. Now you’re starting to see the fruits of that.”\n\nHall of Fame coach Bob Knight, who won three national titles as head coach at Indiana, was on hand to see South Dakota’s zeal for basketball, with campers filling up two practice courts at the Pentagon.\n\n“I think that it’s an unbelievably good thing for kids,” Knight said of the clinic. “I don’t think I’ve ever seen anything where you’ve got so many kids working at something with some direction and so forth.”\n\nWhile Miller took a relaxed approach to the clinic, conversing with spectators and roaming the sidelines, Knight showed the same intensity that made him famous during his years in the game. He directed participants on footwork and techniques to drive with the ball and didn’t hesitate to raise his voice when something wasn’t being done right. Knight was certainly engaged, but he also made it clear that he didn’t miss the grind of coaching for a living.\n\nMiller largely ceded the event to Knight — “It’s his stage,” Miller said — whose notably fiery style brought to mind Gary Munsen, who coached Miller at Mitchell. Munsen, who won 12 state championships with the Kernels, died on Jan. 12.\n\n“They both built structure,” Miller said. They held people accountable. I think that’s why you saw them win. Both were successful. There’s a formula to winning, and both of them had it. Sometimes it’s not the most popular as a player, but as you get out of it, you mature and you understand. It becomes a popular thing, because you appreciate it.”"
