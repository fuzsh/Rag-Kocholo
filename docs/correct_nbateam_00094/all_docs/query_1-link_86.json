        "text": "MIAMI (CBSMiami) â€“ Much has been made of Miami Heat superstar LeBron James losing his headband during the Heat's run in the fourth quarter. But another Heat player put on a nice show sans a piece of equipment in the quarter as well.\n\nThe Heat were down by seven points and looking to come back just two minutes into the quarter when Heat forward Mike Miller literally lost his shoe while coming back up the court.\n\nMiller was on the left wing sans shoe and proceeded to run across the court as LeBron continued to size up San Antonio Spurs defender Boris Diaw on the dribble. As LeBron began to move towards the three-point line, Miller's defender Tony Parker decided to double-team LeBron at the three-point line, leaving Miller open.\n\nJames passed the ball to Miller, who was still without a shoe on his left foot. Miller immediately lofted the shot up and drained a three-point shot to close the lead to just four points. The shot caused Spurs head coach Gregg Popovich to call a timeout.\n\nMiller would get his shoe back and not play much of a role in the remaining parts of the game, but at least for one play, Shoeless Mike once again put up a three-point shot at home for the Heat in the NBA Finals that hit nothing but the bottom of the net."
