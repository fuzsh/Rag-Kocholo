        "text": "Early Wednesday morning, about an hour after his most significant contribution as a member of the Heat, forward Mike Miller headed to the hospital where he has spent much of his time in the past week.\n\nMiller was visiting his wife, Jen, and baby daughter, Jaelyn, who was born last Thursday with a condition that the Millers have not disclosed.\n\nMiller remained at the hospital until 4 a.m.\n\n\"As important as the playoffs or the Eastern Conference Finals are to me, the most important thing right now is (Jaelyn) and my wife,\" Miller said Wednesday before the Heat boarded its charter for Chicago, where it could advance to the NBA Finals with a victory in Thursday night's Game 5.\n\n\"It puts things in perspective. It makes my thumb injuries a lot less important right now.\"\n\nAbout 10 months after being the most significant Heat signing outside of the Big 3, Miller finally was a major contributor. In the Heat's 101-93 overtime victory Tuesday, the former Florida Gators star scored 12 points and had a career playoff high nine rebounds in 26 minutes, providing a huge lift at the most opportune time.\n\nThe Heat outscored the Bulls by a whopping 36 points while Miller was on the floor.\n\n\"It's been a frustrating year for him for a lot of reasons he can't control,\" coach Erik Spoelstra said. \"He was planning on being a big part of our success (and) his injuries kept him in and out of rhythm the entire season.\"\n\nAside from dealing with an ongoing thumb injury, Miller's mind has been preoccupied of late with Jaelyn.\n\nShe is Mike and Jen Miller's third child, their first daughter. Miller said she is \"doing good right now, hopefully she'll continue to do better.\" Jen has been by Jaelyn's side the entire time.\n\nMiller said being away in Chicago will be difficult.\n\n\"I haven't been away from her,\" he said. \"That will be the hard part when you're away and you got to make decisions.\n\n\"Sometimes people don't realize we go through the same things most people go through.\"\n\nDespite his injuries during the season, Miller said he's been confident that his shot would return.\n\nHe entered Tuesday's game 3-of-15 from the floor in the postseason, including 1-of-10 on threes, while averaging 1.7 points.\n\n\"I got some rhythm,\" Miller said. \"Basketball is real rhythm. When you get to play multiple minutes in a row you get a chance to get into the flow of the game and get open and get a sweat going and feel the game out a little bit.\"\n\nMiller, who signed a five-year, $25 million contract in the offseason, did not live up to expectations during the regular season - averaging 5.6 points and shooting 36 percent on three-point field goals. Then came Tuesday, his highest-scoring postseason game since May 1, 2005, when he scored 13 points for Memphis.\n\n\"He just played free. Everything that he gave us tonight was what we always expected out of him,\" LeBron James said.\n\n\"I told him after the game no matter what happened all year, at this moment this was the biggest game you could have played for us, this is what we needed, nothing else matters,\" Dwyane Wade said.\n\nWell, one other thing mattered to Miller more than anything.\n\nA few hours before Saturday's Game 3, he stopped at an athletic apparel store looking for something to honor his daughter.\n\nHe came across a pair of pink shoelaces, bought them, then asked team president Pat Riley if Miller could wear them.\n\nRiley said it was okay and that he would pay the fine if Miller was charged with violating the NBA's uniform policy. The league never said anything.\n\n\"I don't think he realized how much that meant to me,\" Miller said. \"It was important.\n\n\"It's just my baby girl.\""
