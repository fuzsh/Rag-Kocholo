        "text": "Mike Miller hasn't played since the Miami Heat's preseason opener, but he remains healthy according to the Miami Herald. Miller, who played 17 minutes against Atlanta on October 7, told the Herald's Justin Goodman that his absence has less to do with his health and more to do with the team's depth at the moment.\n\n\"I'm good,\" Miller said. \"We've just got a stacked team. I'm just going to keep working and hopefully find a spot.\"\n\nGoodman didn't rule out the possibility that Miller could be hiding an injury. Miller missed 17 of last year's 66 games with an array of injuries, and had surgery in the off-season. As late as last year's playoffs, Miller suffered from back and ankle pain and a possible sports hernia, according to USA Today.\n\nMiller ignited the defending-champion Heat during Game 5 of last year's NBA Finals. He scored 23 points overall and went 7 for 9 from beyond-the-arc."
