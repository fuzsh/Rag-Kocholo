        "text": "After helping the Miami Heat to the tune of two straight NBA Championships, Mike Miller was amnestied today to give the team such much needed salary cap flexibility. Miller is owed $12.8 million over the next two seasons from a contract that he signed back in the summer of 2010, but the move drastically cuts the luxury tax for the upcoming season.\n\nSince joining Miami, Miller has had a history of injuries, but he has come up big in the most important moments despite battling through pain. In the close out game of the 2012 NBA Finals against the Oklahoma City Thunder, he hit seven threes while barely being able to walk. During this year’s finals, he hit on 61% of his threes.\n\nWhen healthy, Miller is one of the most dangerous shooters in the league, especially during the playoffs. But as seen in 2012, he is a pretty good shooter even when he’s not healthy. So for any contending team that needs some consistent outside production, Miller would be a great pick up."
