He didn’t have the same intensity he had earlier in his four-decade coaching career.\n\n“My energy level has been waning,” Miller said Sunday. “I just don’t have the same energy to coach the way I did. I was at practice, but I wasn’t my old self. It was time.”\n\nThe 65-year-old Miller, the winningest men’s basketball coach in Alvernia history, has retired after a 19-year run that produced 300-plus wins and six NCAA Division III Tournament appearances.\n\nD3hoops.com was the first outlet to report the news.\n\nMiller, a cancer survivor, will be succeeded by assistant coach Mike Miller Jr., his son and a former Alvernia player who has been on the staff since 2018.\n\n“It just wasn’t fair to ‘Lite’ (his son) because he was doing a lot of the work,” Miller said. “I let him take over practice a lot. He did all the offense and the defense. He’s a basketball junkie. We switched everything last season. I never did that before in my life.\n\n“He added little things that led to a lot of success the last couple years. And he’s doing all the recruiting. He recruited every guy who’s coming back. Malik Green (the 2022-23 MAC Commonwealth Player of the Year who graduated in May) was the last guy I recruited and I wanted to finish with him.”\n\nMiller said he’s grateful to Alvernia vice president John McCloskey and director of athletics Bill Stiles for their support and for hiring his son as head coach.\n\n“It means a lot that they thought enough of me and my time there to almost let me pick my successor,” he said. “That was very nice. John was the AD who hired me. I also want to thank Jack McCloskey (John’s late father) for hiring me as an assistant and teaching me the college game.”\n\nAfter serving 10 seasons as an assistant coach for Jack McCloskey, including a run to the 1997 Division III Final Four, Miller was hired as head coach in 2005. He guided the Golden Wolves to a 316-178 record, four MAC Commonwealth championships (2011, ’13, ’14, ’15) and two Pennsylvania Athletic Conference titles (2006, ’07).\n\nHis favorite memory from his Alvernia head coaching career came in 2014 when Charles Cooper hit an off-balance shot with 1.5 seconds left to give the Wolves a 70-69 win over Stevenson and the MAC Commonwealth title. Alvernia had trailed by as many as 17 points in the second half.\n\n“We were losing most of the game,” Miller recalled. “It was on the road. They were better than us on paper. That was a nice win.”\n\nIn his final season, he led the Golden Wolves to a 21-9 record and a spot in the MAC Commonwealth championship game, which they lost to Widener. He earned the 300th win of his college coaching career in December when Alvernia defeated York 63-58.\n\nMiller, a 1976 Holy Name graduate, also coached high school boys basketball, first leading Kutztown to a 14-10 record in the 1986-87 season.\n\nHe then was hired at Reading High, where he enjoyed an outstanding six-year tenure. He guided the Red Knights to a 145-31 record from 1988-94, including a record 60 consecutive wins over Berks County opponents.\n\nThere, he coached Donyell Marshall, who went on to become a first-team All-American at Connecticut and who spent 15 seasons in the NBA.\n\nMiller has been inducted into the Berks County Chapter of the Pennsylvania Sports Hall of Fame, the Berks County Basketball Hall of Fame and the Berks Catholic Hall of Fame.\n\n“The record and the championships speak for themselves,” Miller said, “but I’m happier with the guys who graduated. I’ve coached doctors, nurses, state troopers and accountants, all positive influences in society.\n\n“About 20 of them are involved in coaching in some way at all levels. That’s what makes me feel good. That’s what I feel I’ve done with the program.”\n\nOriginally Published: June 25, 2023 at 12:00 p.m."
