Actor Dragan Nikolić is currently in a stable state of health and is recovering at home, and will soon travel to Vrnjačka Banja, where he will continue to work on his recovery with a team of medical staff, writes Blic.

His wife Milena Dravić and friends certainly provide him with the greatest support, so his mood is currently good, and the rehabilitation process is satisfactory.

However, during the past week they appeared information that he was hospitalized again, which upset many admirers of the famous artist. Sources close to him, on the other hand, state that Dragan was receiving treatment at home the whole time, and that, in a conversation with his wife Milena and a team of doctors, he decided to go to Vrnjačka Banja for recovery.

The great Serbian actor underwent colon surgery in February of this year at the Clinic for Digestive Diseases of the Clinical Center of Serbia, but three months later he fell ill, so he was hospitalized again and the recovery process lasted until August. Since then, Dragan has been undergoing treatment at home in his home in Belgrade, away from the public eye.

"I'm much better, but I wouldn't want to talk about it anymore. Please understand me. When my Milena is next to me, I don't miss anything!" Dragan Nikolić told Blic at the time.

Before going to the operation, he announced that he was finishing the autobiographical film "I dreamed".

"I think it will be interesting, it's all about my life, and I hope I haven't wasted my life," Nikolić said then and pointed out that he had a problem finding a colleague to play him when he was young.
