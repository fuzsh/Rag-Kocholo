The real giant experienced this very emotional, aware of its size, but also the love that the audience gave it. She was also conscious of her illness, medication and therapy, because she dutifully and strongly fought for another morning, another day, another dream.\n\nPeople came to me with love, with tears in their eyes. Given my troubled situation after my Draganâ€™s departure and my illness, that really struck me. Everyone wanted at least to touch me. They did not burden me, but they wanted to show me that they supported me, they care, Milena said, in one of the last interviews, seen in Palic Lake."
