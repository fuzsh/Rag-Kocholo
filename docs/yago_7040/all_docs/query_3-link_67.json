        "text": "The ‘Love Time Machine’ cabaret show about the famous love stories of the Serbian great personalities, writers, scientists, rulers, musicians and actors was performed tonight on the roof terrace of the Central Military Club of the Serbian Armed Forces.\n\nActress Vesna Stanković, who signs both the dramatisation and directing of this cabaret, as well as a musician and an artist Vladimir Preradović Lord, took part in the play.\n\nThe common thread that binds all of these stories is love through which the personal destiny of the historical figures is told, as well as the collective history of the Serbian people told through significant upheavals in the lives of celebrities. Through these stories, the audience was able to recall some forgotten details, but also to get acquainted with something that has been neglected through historical lessons, which represents an interesting, but not less important, history of our science, spirituality and culture.\n\nThis kind of theatrical time machine covers the period of the past two centuries and speaks about the most prominent figures of that period. In front of the audience, there passed stories of great loves of famous Serbs were told: Hajduk Veljko and Čučuk Stana, Laza Kostić and Lenka Dunđerski, Živojin and Lujza Mišić, then Prince Mihajlo, Đura Jakšić, Aleksa Šantić, Ivo Andrić, Meša Selimović, Duško Radović, Olivera and Rade Marković, all the way to Dragan Nikolić and Milena Dravić.\n\nEach story had its own song that marked the period when the love story started, so this is also a musical time machine, because some songs are almost nowhere to be heard. All songs were performed live, accompanied by piano and guitar.\n\nThe author of the play, Vesna Stanković, told the assembled audience that there were many more such stories waiting their turn to be told. The ‘Love Time Machine’ cabaret included only one part of the storytelling that she had collected and prepared for performing on the stage for years.\n\nThe audience was able to enjoy the magic of the stories and songs prepared by the authors of the cabaret in the pleasant atmosphere, on the rooftop of the Central Military Club of the Serbian Armed Forces, this evening again. This was an opportunity to remind ourselves of the intimate history of the Serbian people that was told through these love stories and had a good reception with the Belgrade audience, as well. In addition to being able to enjoy the humorous and inspiring performance of Vesna Stanković and Vladimir Preradović Lord, the spectators present at the full terrace of the Central Military Club could recall all those valuable moments that reflect the character and spirit of the Serbian people, and thus their love stories, through history."
