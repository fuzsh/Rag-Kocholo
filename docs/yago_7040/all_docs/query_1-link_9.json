        "text": "Unique and great - Milena Dravić is one of the biggest actresses from this area.\n\nShe passed away last year due to a battle with the disease, with her family by her side. She spent the last days of her life in the hospital, she was sick for days. The doctors tried everything, but there was no salvation. She received the closest family members, and asked all others not to visit her. It could be said that in some way Milena left because of the sadness for her unrepentant husband Dragan Nikolić. They spent almost 50 years together, and when he died, Milena fell ill. Two and a half years later, she followed him.\n\nShe tried her hand at modeling\n\nIn her life, she reached unimaginable heights, and it all started in Belgrade. The city where she was born, which she adored so much. But never arrogant and intrusive, but the way one loves the place of one's childhood and upbringing. She was born in that city, and before entering the world of acting, she tried her hand at modeling. Her parents first scolded her for going to the audition without asking, and then they allowed her to wear shows. She also got the cover of the magazine 'Duga', and that marked the beginning of her acting career.\n\nDirector František Čáp saw the cover and offered her a role in the film 'The Door Remains Open'. She experienced her real first and great success with her role in \"Prekobrojna\" by Branko Bauer.\n\nDuring that period, she also appeared on television and in film 'WR The Orgasm Mystery' in Cannes in 1971 received congratulations from Yoko Aries, Jack Nicholson, and John Lennon. Due to a conflict with an American journalist, she missed the role in 'Battle for the Neretva', but she played in 'Sutjeska'. Nicholson, Lennon and Joko Ono were not the only ones who met Dravič. Hitchcock hung out with her in Belgrade, and she gave Lizzie Minnelli her earrings. Over the years, she met Robert De Niro, Clint Eastwood, Ava Gardner...\n\nAdmired for her attitude, human size, temperament\n\nShe was incredibly talented and beautiful, but that was not Milena Dravić's strength. In addition to all that, she had a lot of attitude, a correct attitude that she was not afraid to express. When she expressed her opinion about the war, she was punished and did not appear on television for almost 20 years. She didn't mind. Just as she had no problem talking about the position of women in society and the struggle they lead every day.\n\nPrivately, she adored her husband Dragan Nikolić. Before him, she was in two short marriages, but with her beloved Gaga, she found true happiness. They met on the set of the movie Horoscope in 1969, when Milena was already very successful, and Dragan was still fighting for his place. They got married very quickly, already in 1970 - and during a break from filming. They used their lunch break to get married, and their godmother was Seka Sablić. After the ceremony, they went to lunch and continued as if nothing had happened. They remained married until his death in 2016.\n\nSource: 100posto.jutarnji.hr"
