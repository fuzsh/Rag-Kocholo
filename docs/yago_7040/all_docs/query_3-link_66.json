        "text": "\"Horoscope\" at the Paris Theater is the first feature film of Boro Draskovic, one of the young Yugoslav directors whose work was introduced here in screenings at the Museum of Modern Art last fall. Among recent Yugoslav film makers, Draskovic would seem to favor a relatively conservative, intellectually inclusive approach to films—in the manner, say, of \"Cahiers du Cinèma\" five years ago rather than in the manner of \"Cahiers du Cinèma\" today. Because I share many of Draskovic's prejudices, and because he is a director of genuine ambition and considerable competence, I wish \"Horoscope\" were a better movie.Set in a minor rail-junction town near Yugoslavia's Adriatic-coast resorts, \"Horoscope\" concerns a group of aimless young men who mostly lie around in the hot sun all day at the railroad station restaurant. They relieve their boredom with acts of petty bravado and aimless horseplay, and by conning the holiday crowds of passengers making connections between trains.When a pretty blonde (Milean Dravic) arrives to operate the station's brand new kiosk—an unlikely concession specializing in newspapers, knives, Miss Dravic, and no visible customers—one of the young men (Dragan Nikolic) swears, on a dare, that he will make her within a week. The manner and shifting motives of his assault provide the fiction upon which the film bases its preoccupations.Nothing about the story is dramatically necessary or thematically interesting. But at the same time, al the peripheral elements — the cruel games, the extensive anecdotes (particularly, a local wedding, full of folk custom and devoted to seven days of musical celebration and ritual blood-letting), compositional detail and visual symbolism—receive such elaborate and carefully programmatic treatment, that \"Horoscope\" suffers from a kind of gigantism of its rhetorical members.Some of those members, for example the wedding celebration, achieve a genuine intensity that from moment to moment almost carries the movie. Others at least excite admiration: among them, the ways in which Draskovic introduces the creatures and imitates the circular figure of the Zodiac to fulfill the suggestions of chance and repetition implicit in his title.But a world as patently constructed (half rock, half reptile—according to several key images) as is the world of \"Horoscope\" provides too many clues and allows too little to the unaided imagination. It continually points toward significance but never really makes meaning, and its action ultimately fades into a violent melodrama of easy irony and pointless pathos.\n\nThe CastHOROSCOPE, directed by Boro Draskovic; screenplay (Serbo-Croatian) with English subtitles) by Mr. Draskovic and Zuko Dzumhur; photography by Ognjen Milicavic; music by Zoran Hristic; presented by Laurance and Robin V.
