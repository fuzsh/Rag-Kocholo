        "text": "From the industrial revolution to WW1\n\nKey words: industrial revolution, production, machines, increase, new energy sources, invention / innovation, steam engine, coal, railroads, steel.\n\nWhat changed with the first industrial revolution, and how did it change the production process? What are some of the inventions?\n\nThe first industrial revolution\n\nThe first industrial revolution out of four, them being:\n\n1. The First Industrial Revolution (1765)\n\n2. The Second Industrial Revolution (1870)\n\n3. The Third Industrial Revolution (1969)\n\n4. Industry 4.0 (publicly introduced in 2011)\n\nThe Industrial Revolution, now also known as the First Industrial Revolution, was the transition to new manufacturing processes in Europe and the United States, in the period from about 1760 to sometime between 1820 and 1840. This transition included going from hand production methods to machines, new chemical manufacturing and iron production processes, the increasing use of steam power and water power, the development of machine tools and the rise of the mechanized factory system. The Industrial Revolution also led to an unprecedented rise in the rate of population growth.\n\nThe Enlightenment, or Age of Reason, effected a generation shift in social ideals, which was followed by even greater social, political and economic culture. The period is now collectively termed as the Industrial Revolution. Scientific advances and technological innovations, improved agriculture and peoples living conditions and working lives. Beginning in England, these developments assisted the growth of national wealth and prosperity for some, while population surge generated increasing demand.\n\nEven though this revolution is usually described as occurring between approximately 1760 and 1840, there was no sudden transformation. Improved agriculture, industry and shipping led to an increase in the production of almost everything required by consumers, and the resulting dynamism of the economy transferred from agriculture to industry and trade.\n\nIndustrialisation marked a shift from individual, hand made production to powered, special-purpose machinery, factories and mass production. The cumulative effect of a number of consequential inventions and designers made this possible.\n\nSingle-action Steam Engine 1763-75\n\nIn 1698 the first commercial used steam-powered engine was built by English engineer Thomas Savery. Designed to pump water out of coal mines, Savery’s invention, consisting of a simple boiler and a pipe, had several problems. In 1912 his partner, Thomas Newcomen, improved Savery’s steam pump with his atmospheric engine, which also deployed steam power. Also intended to pump water out of mines, Newcomen engines were fairly complex and were never cost effective. In 1763, while repeating a Newcomen engine, Scottish instrument maker James Watt decided to improve the design. Watt solved the problems of the Newcomen engine by creating a separate condenser outside the cylinder. Watts still had obstacles to surmount in constructing a full scale engine, including a lack of capital and insufficient technology to make the parts. He formed a partnership with a manufacturer Matthew Boulton. Trough Boulton, Watt had access to some of the best ironworkers in the world and gained the means to mass-produce his engines. As a direct result of the invention, the Industrial Revolution was irrevocably activated.\n\nThis engine had three main features, them being: the cylinder, the piston and the condenser.\n\nThe cylinder was constantly hot, there was no enforced cooling required. The shell around the main cylinder helps to make it hot. The steam cylinder operates on the downward stroke of the steam piston. The weight of the pump side tips the beam so that the steam piston rises.\n\nThe engine operated on the principle of a pressure difference created by a vacuum on one side of the piston, which pushed it down. The top of the steam cylinder is sealed. During the upward and downward strokes at atmospheric pressure, steam exists above the piston.\n\nWatt’s invention included a separate condenser. Valves enable the steam to flow into a separate condenser. When the condenser is under a vacuum =, the steam from below the piston then rushes into it. The steam then condenses and so the vacuum is maintained.\n\nTextiles, a capital investments\n\nTextiles were the dominant industry of the Industrial Revolution in terms of employment, value of output and capital invested. The textile industry was also the first to use modern production methods.\n\nBefore the 18th century, the manufacture of cloth was performed by individual workers, in the premises in which they lived and goods were transported around the country by packhorses or by river navigation-sand contour-following canals that had been constructed in the early 18th century. In the mid-18th century, artisans were inventing ways to become more productive. Silk, wool, and linen fabrics were being eclipsed by cotton which became the most important textile.\n\nInnovations in carding and spinning enabled by advances in cast iron technology resulted in the creation of larger spinning mules and water frames. The machinery was housed in water-powered mills on streams. The need for more power stimulated the production of steam-powered beam engines, and rotative mill engines transmitting the power to line shafts on each floor of the mill. Surplus power capacity encouraged the construction of more sophisticated power looms working in weaving sheds. The scale of production in the mill towns round Manchester created a need for a commercial structure; for a cotton exchange and warehousing. The technology was used in woollen and worsted mills in the West Yorkshire and elsewhere.\n\nOne of several crucial entrepreneurs was the manufacturer Richard Arkwright who created the first water-powered cotton mill, combining skills, machinery and materials into what became the factory system. He also developed horse power and then water power, which made cotton manufacture a mechanised industry. Further significant inventions included the power loom, developed in the 1780s by Edmund Cartwright that mechanised the process of weaving cloth, the power loom.\n\nCotton Gin\n\nBefore the 1760s, textile production was a cottage industry using mainly flax and wool. A typical weaving family would own one hand loom, which would be operated by the man with help of a boy; the wife, girls and other women could make sufficient yarn for that loom.\n\nThe knowledge of textile production had existed for centuries. India had a textile industry that used cotton, from which it manufactured cotton textiles. When raw cotton was exported to Europe it could be used to make fustian.\n\nTwo systems had developed for spinning: the simple wheel, which used an intermittent process and the more refined, Saxony wheel which drove a differential spindle and flyer with a heck that guided the thread onto the bobbin, as a continuous process. This was satisfactory for use on handlooms, but neither of these wheels could produce enough thread for the looms after the invention by John Kay in 1734 of the flying shuttle, which made the loom twice as productive.\n\nCloth production moved away from the cottage into manufactories. The first moves towards manufactories called mills were made in the spinning sector. The move in the weaving sector was later. By the 1820s, all cotton, wool, and worsted was spun in mills; but this yarn went to outworking weavers who continued to work in their own homes. A mill that specialized in weaving fabric was called a weaving shed.\n\nEli Whitney’s cotton gin (1793)\n\nOne of the first great inventions of the Industrial Revolution in the United States was the cotton gin (short for cotton engine), invented by Eli Whitney. This simple machine revolutionised the production of cotton by accelerating the process of removing seeds from cotton fibre.\n\nThe cotton gin had two main revolutionary features, them being the hand crank and the cylinder. The hand crank made it possible for the worker to remove the seeds from 22.5kg of short-staple cotton in a day. That is, more or less, fifty times more than the average cotton picker could do by hand. Larger cotton gins could be powered by horses, and later by steam engines.\n\nThe cotton gyn was a relatively simple machine. Raw cotton was fed into a revolving cylinder via hopper, short wire hooks pulled the cotton fibre trough mesh and dropped it into a pile, while the seeds were deposited separately, ready to be planted next season.\n\nWhitney’s cotton gin caused the cotton industry to expand vastly and greatly transformed the US economy. Because off the invention, the yield of raw cotton doubled every decade after 1800. The cotton gin boosted the textile industry, but an accompanying increase in the use of slave labour contributed to the outbreak of the American Civil War (1861-65). By the mid 19th century, the US was growing 75 per cent of the world’s entire cotton supply.\n\nA little bit more on how the cotton gin advanced slavery and the image above here.\n\nRapid urbanisation\n\nDuring the early 19th century, there was a large population growth caused by the improvements of the Agricultural Revolution of the 18th century. Many historians believe this population increase was due to a dramatic decline in the death rate. A drop in famines, warfare and illnesses, and an increase in food sources, all mixed to cause a population spike. As early as 1850, many European cities were centers of industrial growth. In fact, by 1850, over 50% of the entire population of Great Britain lived in either a town or a city instead of in a rural community.\n\nThe Industrial Revolution changed material production, wealth, labor patterns and population distribution. Although many rural areas remained farming communities during this time, the lives of people in cities changed drastically. The new industrial labor opportunities caused a population shift from the countryside to the cities. The new factory work led to a need for a strict system of factory discipline.\n\nDuring this time, child labor and the unsafe working conditions rampant in many factories led to reform movements. Population movement was caused by people living in small farming communities who moved to cities. These prospective workers were looking for wage labor in newly developed factories.\n\nHow does industrialisation lead to urbanisation here.\n\nThe growth of cities led to horrible living conditions. The wealthy fared far better than the industrial workers because they could afford to live in the suburbs on the outskirts of the city. However, for most of the factory workers, cities were dirty, crowded places where epidemics frequently broke out.\n\nOvercrowded row homes created to house the workers and their families contributed to these conditions. Government reports of the time indicated people sleeping as many as six to one bed.\n\nThe sanitary conditions in early industrial cities were filthy as well. Since the municipal governments did not concern themselves with cleanliness at the time, the cities did not have proper waste disposal systems, and people threw trash and sewage directly into the streets. The burning coal of the industrial factories coated cities in a layer of grime and polluted the air, and water supplies were polluted by waste.\n\nSome documentaries that tackle the topic of urbanisation today are: Urbanized (2011), Human Scale (2012), Social Life of Small Urban Spaces (1980).\n\nChild labour in factories\n\nThe majority of textile factory workers during the Industrial Revolution were unmarried women and children, including many orphans. They typically worked for 12 to 14 hours per day with only Sundays off. It was common for women take factory jobs seasonally during slack periods of farm work. Lack of adequate transportation, long hours and poor pay made it difficult to recruit and maintain workers. Many workers, such as displaced farmers and agricultural workers, who had nothing but their labour to sell, became factory workers out of necessity.\n\n“[…] It is a distortion of facts to say that the factories carried off the housewives from the nurseries and the kitchen and the children from their play. These women had nothing to cook with and to feed their children. These children were destitute and starving. Their only refuge was the factory. It saved them, in the strict sense of the term, from death by starvation.[…]”\n\nEconomist Ludwig von Mises eloquently stated this his book ‘Human Action‘\n\nAs well as working in factories, many children were also employed in coal mines. Coal was one of the key resources necessary for industrialisation and one of the reasons that Britain was the first country to industrialise in the 1700s.\n\nIn all, child labor was a common feature of the Industrial Revolution and involved children suffering under horrible and abusive conditions. Whether it was in factories, mines or other workplaces, children were expected to work in hot and dangerous conditions for low amounts of pay and long gruelling hours.\n\nMore about the pain and suffering of the children which were exploited during these times in following links, 01, 02 and 03.\n\nRailways\n\nIf the steam engine is the icon of the industrial revolution, it’s most famous incarnation is the steam driven locomotive. The union of steam and iron rails produced the railways, a new form of transport which boomed in the later nineteenth century, affecting industry and social life.\n\nIn 1821 Stephenson built the Stockton to Darlington railway using iron rails and steam power with the aim of breaking the local monopoly of the canal owners. The initial plan had been for horses to provide the energy, but Stephenson pushed for steam. The importance of this has been exaggerated, as it still remained as “fast” as a canal (i.e. slow). The first time a railway used a true steam locomotive running on rails was the Liverpool to Manchester railway in 1830. This is probably the true landmark in rail and mirrored the route of the groundbreaking Bridgewater Canal. Indeed, the owner of the canal had opposed the railway to protect his investment. The Liverpool to Manchester railway provided the management blueprint for later development, creating a permanent staff and recognizing the potential of passenger travel. Indeed, until the 1850s railways made more from passengers than freight.\n\nIn the 1830s canal companies, challenged by new railways, cut prices and largely kept their business. As railways were rarely connected they were generally used for local freight and passengers. However, industrialists soon realized that railways could make a clear profit, and in 1835-37, and 1844-48 there was such a boom in the creation of railways that ‘railway mania’ was said to have swept the country. In this later period, there were 10,000 acts creating railways. Of course, this mania encouraged the creation of lines which were unviable and in competition with each other. The government largely adopted a laissez-faire attitude but did intervene to try and stop accidents and dangerous competition. They also passed a law in 1844 ordering third class travel to be on at least one train a day, and the Gauge Act of 1846 to make sure the trains ran on the same sort of rails.\n\nThe effect of railways in the Industrial Revolution is often exaggerated. They did not cause industrialization and had no impact on the changing locations of industries as they only developed after 1830 and were initially slow to catch on. What they did do was allow the revolution to continue, provide further stimulus, and help to transform the mobility and diets of the population.\n\nTelegraph\n\nAn electrical telegraph consisted of two or more geographically separated stations (often called telegraph offices) connected by wires, usually supported overhead on utility poles. There were many different electrical telegraph systems invented, but the ones that became widespread fit into two broad categories.\n\nThe first category consists of needle telegraphs in which a needle pointer is made to move electromagnetically with a pulse of electric current from a battery or dynamo down the telegraph line. Early systems used multiple needles requiring multiple wires. The first commercial system, and the most widely used needle telegraph, was the Cooke and Wheatstone telegraph, invented in 1837. Early equipment sets used five needles to point to the letter being transmitted, but the cost of installing wires was more economically significant than the cost of training operators so a single-needle system with a code that had to be learned became the norm.\n\nThe second category consists of armature systems in which the pulse activates a telegraph sounder which makes a click. The archetype of this category was the Morse system, invented by Samuel Morse in 1838, using a single wire. At the sending station, an operator would tap on a switch called a telegraph key, spelling out text messages in Morse code. Originally, the armature was intended to make marks on paper tape, but operators learned to interpret the clicks and it was more efficient to write down the message directly. In 1865, the Morse system became the standard for international communication with a modified code developed for German railways. However, some countries continued to use established national systems internally for some time afterwards.\n\nSamuel Morse’s telegraph\n\nThe man most commonly associated with the telegraph, Samuel Morse, did not invent the communications tool. But he developed it, commercialised it and invented the famous code for it that bears his name.\n\nDeveloped in the 1830s and 1840s by Samuel Morse (1791-1872) and other inventors, the telegraph revolutionised long-distance communication. It worked by transmitting electrical signals over a wire laid between stations. In addition to helping invent the telegraph, Samuel Morse developed a code (bearing his name) that assigned a set of dots and dashes to each letter of the English alphabet and allowed for the simple transmission of complex messages across telegraph lines. In 1844, Morse sent his first telegraph message, from Washington, D.C., to Baltimore, Maryland; by 1866, a telegraph line had been laid across the Atlantic Ocean from the U.S. to Europe. Although the telegraph had fallen out of widespread use by the start of the 21st century, replaced by the telephone, fax machine and Internet, it laid the groundwork for the communications revolution that led to those later innovations.\n\nMorse Code\n\nTo transmit messages across telegraph wires, in the 1830s Morse and Vail created what came to be known as Morse code. The code assigned letters in the alphabet and numbers a set of dots (short marks) and dashes (long marks) based on the frequency of use; letters used often (such as “E”) got a simple code, while those used infrequently (such as “Q”) got a longer and more complex code. Initially, the code, when transmitted over the telegraph system, was rendered as marks on a piece of paper that the telegraph operator would then translate back into English. Rather quickly, however, it became apparent that the operators were able to hear and understand the code just by listening to the clicking of the receiver, so the paper was replaced by a receiver that created more pronounced beeping sounds.\n\nWhile Morse Code may now seem like a relic of a distant telecoms past, it is still in use today. In a world marked by poverty and lack of widespread internet coverage, it has great advantages as a tool of communication. It can be cheaply transmitted, is simple to use, and Morse signals can be picked up even when reception is poor. And tests have shown it can be quicker to send a message by Morse than texting.\n\nThe world during the 19th century\n\nThe 19th century saw large amounts of social change; slavery was abolished (even though it exists even today), and the First and Second Industrial Revolutions (which also overlap with the 18th and 20th centuries, respectively) led to massive urbanisation and much higher levels of productivity, profit and prosperity. The Islamic gunpowder empires were formally dissolved and European imperialism brought much of South Asia, Southeast Asia and almost all of Africa under colonial rule.\n\nThe first electronics appeared in the 19th century, with the introduction of the electric relay in 1835, the telegraph and its Morse code protocol in 1837, the first telephone call in 1876, and the first functional light bulb in 1878.\n\nThe 19th century was an era of rapidly accelerating scientific discovery and invention, with significant developments in the fields of mathematics, physics, chemistry, biology, electricity, and metallurgy that laid the groundwork for the technological advances of the 20th century. The Industrial Revolution began in Great Britain and spread to continental Europe, North America and Japan. The Victorian era was notorious for the employment of young children in factories and mines, as well as strict social norms regarding modesty and gender roles. Japan embarked on a program of rapid modernisation following the Meiji Restoration, before defeating China, under the Qing Dynasty, in the First Sino-Japanese War. Advances in medicine and the understanding of human anatomy and disease prevention took place in the 19th century, and were partly responsible for rapidly accelerating population growth in the western world. Europe’s population doubled during the 19th century, from approximately 200 million to more than 400 million. The introduction of railroads provided the first major advancement in land transportation for centuries, changing the way people lived and obtained goods, and fuelling major urbanization movements in countries across the globe. Numerous cities worldwide surpassed populations of a million or more during this century. London became the world’s largest city and capital of the British Empire. Its population increased from 1 million in 1800 to 6.7 million a century later. Accurate and detailed maps of the globe were available by the 1890s. Liberalism became the pre-eminent reform movement in Europe.\n\nThe Great Exhibition\n\nThe first in a series of world fairs, the Great Exhibition was devised by Henry Cole, an English civil servant. Thought his membership of the Society for the Encouragement of Arts, Manufacturers and Commerce, Cole campaigned to improve standards in industrial design.\n\nPrince Albert, Queen Victoria’s husband and the society’s president, supported his idea, and in 1847 a royal charter was granted to the organisation.\n\nIn 1849 Cole visited the Exposition Nationale des products de I’industrie agricole et manufacturiere (Exposition of the Second Republic) in Paris and noticed there was no opportunity for international exhibitors. On his return to England he secured a Royal Commission for an international exhibition to be held in London.\n\nLed by Prince Albert, the society planned the Great Exhibition of the Industry of all Nations. Held from 1 May to 15 October 1851 in London’s Hyde Park, the exhibition attracted more than six million visitors and featured over 100,000 exhibits by more than 15,000 contributors.\n\nIt was the first time that the nations of the world had come together in one place in peace, and it was a showcase for the manufacturers of Britain and the world, a pivotal moment for the development of design in the 19th century.\n\nOverall, despite the Industrial Revolution, most Europeans still appreciated the virtues of hand craftsmanship – of embellishment over function. Americans, however, preferred mass production as a means to achieve better-made, simple designed objects in greater numbers. For critics of the day, the contrast between overly ornate household products and those displaying either an embellished functional aesthetic, or those revealing an instinctive connection between hand and eye, established the urgent need for a design reform, education and accord.\n\nIn modern times, the Great Exhibition is a symbol of the Victorian Age, and its thick catalogue, illustrated with steel engravings, is a primary source for High Victorian design. A memorial to the exhibition, crowned with a statue of Prince Albert, is located behind the Royal Albert Hall. It is inscribed with statistics from the exhibition, including the number of visitors and exhibitors (British and foreign), and the profit made.\n\nThe Crystal Palace\n\nA new method of producing glass, known as the cylinder process, was developed in Europe during the early 19th century. In 1832 this process was used by the Chance Brothers to create sheet glass. They became the leading producers of window and plate glass. This advancement allowed for larger panes of glass to be created without interruption, thus freeing up the space planning in interiors as well as the fenestration of buildings. The Crystal Palace is the supreme example of the use of sheet glass in a new and innovative structure.\n\nIf you took an omnibus along London’s Knightsbridge in the summer of 1851, you would see an astonishing sight. Glittering among the trees was a palace made of glass, like something out of the Arabian Nights. It was as tall as the trees, indeed taller, because the building arched over two of them already growing there, as if, like giant plants in a glasshouse, they had been transplanted with no disturbance to their roots. A shower of rain washed the dust from the glass, and made it glitter all the more. Nothing like this had been seen in London, ever. It was the Great Exhibition of the Works of Industry of All Nations.\n\nSinger sewing machine (1851)\n\nThe eighth child of poor German immigrants, Isaac Singer was born on October 27, 1811, in Pittstown, New York. As a young man he worked as a mechanic and cabinetmaker. For a time he was an actor and formed his own theatrical troupe, The Merritt Players.” Needing a steadier income, Singer worked for a plant in Fredericksburg, Ohio, that manufactured wooden type for printers. Seeing the need for a better type-carving machine, he invented an improved one.\n\nIn June 1850, Singer and a partner took the machine to Boston looking for financial support. He rented display space in the workshop of Orson C. Phelps. Here Singer became intrigued with the sewing machine that Phelps was building for John A. Lerow and Sherburne C. Blodgett.\n\nSinger, after examining the machine, noted “instead of the shuttle going around in a circle, I would have it move to and fro in a straight line. In place of the needle bar pushing a curved needle horizontally, I would have a straight needle and make it work up and down.”\n\nAfter 11 days and forty dollars in cost, Singer completed his invention: the world’s first practical sewing machine. This machine had a straight eye-pointed needle and transverse shuttle, an overhanging arm, a table to support the cloth, a presser foot to hold the material against the upward stroke of the needle, and a roughened feed wheel extending through a slot in the table. Motion was communicated to the needle arm and shuttle by means of gears.\n\nSinger also conceived the idea of using a treadle similar to that of a spinning wheel; all other machines at the time used a hand crank to generate power.\n\nFor his first patent model, Isaac Singer submitted a commercial sewing machine. He was granted Patent No. 8,294, on August 12, 1851. These commercial sewing machines were built in Orson C. Phelps’s machine shop in Boston.\n\nAlways the showman, Singer relished exhibiting his invention at social gatherings and was masterful in convincing the women present that the sewing machine was a tool they could learn to use. The machine was transported in its packing crate, which served as a stand; it contained a wooden treadle that allowed the seamstress to power the machine with her feet, leaving both hands free to guide the cloth. This early, heavy-duty Singer machine was designed for use in the manufacturing trades rather than in the home.\n\nWithin two years Singer is the leading manufacturer and marketer of sewing machines in the United States.\n\nIn 1855 Singer becomes the world’s largest sewing company. Singer begins overseas expansion, starting in Paris, France, making Singer the world’s first international company.\n\nThonet Chair n.14\n\nMichael Thonet (2 July 1796 – 3 March 1871) was a German-Austrian cabinet maker, known for the invention of bentwood furniture (Thonet began trying to make furniture out of glued and bent wooden slats in the 1830s)\n\nThonet’s essential breakthrough was his success in having light, strong wood bent into curved, graceful shapes by forming the wood in hot steam. This enabled him to design entirely novel, elegant, lightweight, durable and comfortable furniture, which appealed strongly to fashion – a complete departure from the heavy, carved designs of the past – and whose aesthetic and functional appeal remains to this day.\n\nGerman cabinetmaker Michael Thonet dreamt about designing a chair that could be mass-produced and sold at an affordable price. After years of technical experiments he finally succeeded and the No.14 was launched in 1859; the first piece of furniture to be both good-looking and inexpensive.\n\nThe 1859 chair Nr. 14 – better known as Konsumstuhl Nr. 14, coffee shop chair no. 14 – is still called the “chair of chairs” with some 50 million produced and still in production today. The innovative bending technique allowed for the industrial production of a chair for the first time ever. What was revolutionary about the former no.14, which is today’s no. 214, was the fact that it could be disassembled into a few components and thus produced in work-sharing processes. The chair could be exported to all nations of the world in simple, space saving packages: 36 disassembled chairs could fit into a one cubic meter box. It yielded a gold medal for Thonet’s enterprise at the 1867 Paris World’s Fair.\n\nThe original No.14 chair is made up of six pieces of wood, ten screws and two nuts. It was the first piece of furniture designed to be shipped in parts to save space during transportation and came with simple instructions to put it together. The No.14 could have been a source of inspiration for IKEA, the biggest manufacturer of ready-to-assemble furniture today.\n\nThe Arts and Crafts Movement\n\nThe Arts and Crafts Exhibition Society was formed in London in 1887 to promote the exhibition of decorative arts alongside fine arts. The Society’s exhibitions were held annually at the New Gallery from 1888 to 1890, and roughly every three years thereafter, were important in the flowering of the British Arts and Crafts Movement in the decades prior to World War I.\n\nEmerging in the late 19th century Victorian England, the Arts and Crafts movement was more than just a nouveau style in decorative arts. It was born in reaction to Industrial Revolution, reevaluating the concept of hand-craftsmanship in the light of industrial manufacture, mechanization and mass-produced objects of inferior quality.\n\nThe movement was rooted in the ideals of pre-industrial times, a response to the anxieties that did not only concern aesthetics but also fundamental social issues like industrial labor, capitalism, and alienation of people from their work. It was also one of the first art movements that blurred the line between fine arts and crafts and due to this revision of traditional art hierarchy that allowed a greater involvement of women practitioners.\n\nThe Arts and Crafts Exhibition Society made new and ambitious claims for the public significance of decorative art. Although the nineteenth century witnessed a dramatic increase in the number of display spaces available to artists, these opportunities were enjoyed mainly by painters and, to some extent, sculptors. Artists whose medium fell into the category of the so-called decorative arts (which included ceramics, textiles, metalwork, furniture, and glassware, among other media) benefited less from these developments and felt marginalized by the system. The imbalance had both financial and ideological implications. The lack of opportunities for public exposure meant that decorative artists struggled to market their work to potential purchasers.\n\nThe illustrator and designer Walter Crane served as the founding president of the Society for its first three years. Of its goals and purposes, he wrote:\n\n“We desired first of all to give opportunity to the designer and craftsman to exhibit their work to the public for its artistic interest and thus to assert the claims of decorative art and handicraft to attention equally with the painter of easel pictures, hitherto almost exclusively associated with the term art in the public mind. Ignoring the artificial distinction between Fine and Decorative art, we felt that the real distinction was what we conceived to be between good and bad art, or false and true taste and methods in handicraft, considering it of little value to endeavour to classify art according to its commercial value or social importance, while everything depended upon the spirit as well as the skill and fidelity with which the conception was expressed, in whatever material, seeing that a worker earned the title of artist by the sympathy with and treatment of his material, by due recognition of its capacity, and its natural limitations, as well as of the relation of the work to use and life.“\n\nWalter Crane\n\nAnnual exhibitions were held at the New Gallery in 1888, 1889, and 1890, but the third exhibition failed to match the quality of the first two, and was a financial disaster.William Morris succeeded Crane as president in 1891., and the Society thereafter chose to reduce the frequency of showings in order to ensure an abundance of materials to display.\n\nThe Exposition Universelle of 1889\n\nThe Exposition Universelle of 1889 was a world’s fair held in Paris, France, from 5 May to 31 October 1889. It was the fourth of eight expositions held in the city between 1855 and 1937. It attracted more than thirty-two million visitors. The most famous structure created for the Exposition, and still remaining, is the Eiffel Tower.\n\nThe Exposition was held to celebrate the 100th anniversary of the Storming of the Bastille, which marked the beginning of French Revolution, and was also seen as a way to stimulate the economy and pull France out of an economic recession. The Exposition attracted 61,722 official exhibitors, of whom twenty-five thousand were from outside of France.\n\nBecause of the theme of the Exposition, celebrating the overthrow of the French monarchy, nearly all European countries with monarchies officially boycotted the Exposition. The boycotting nations were Germany, Austria-Hungary, Belgium, Spain, the United Kingdom, Italy, the Netherlands, Portugal, Russia, and Sweden.\n\nNonetheless, many citizens and companies from those countries participated, and a number of countries had their participation entirely funded by private sponsors. They included Germany and Alsace-Lorraine, Austria-Hungary, Belgium, Brazil. China, Denmark, Egypt, Spain, the United Kingdom and its colonies, Haiti, Italy, Luxembourg, the Netherlands, Peru, Portugal, Romania, Russia, Finland and Sweden.\n\nThe countries that officially participated in the Exposition were Andorra, Argentina, Bolivia, Chile, Costa Rica, the Dominican Republic, Ecuador, the United States, Greece, Guatemala, Haiti, Hawaii, Honduras, India, Japan, Morocco, Mexico, Monaco, Nicaragua, Norway, Paraguay, Persia, Saint-Martin, El Salvador, Serbia, Siam, the Republic of South Africa, Switzerland, Uruguay and Venezuela. The British dominions of New Zealand and Tasmania also took part.\n\nThe colonial pavilions conveyed the multiculturalism of France’s colonies, the largest of them being the Palais Central des Colonies, designed by Stephen Sauvestre, who notably contributed to the design of the Eiffel Tower. In addition to the architectural displays of France’s colonies, the exposition showcased a construction of villages inhabited by natives of the colonies, to be observed by viewers. The colonized people had their daily lives displayed for the exposition visitors, which made some of them uncomfortable.\n\nSamba Lawbé Thiam, a jeweler from Senegal who was part of the 1889 exposition, said the following:\n\nThe incorporation of indigenous colonized individuals in the exposition was intended to be an educational element, but has also historically been framed as an exploitative and patronizing display of colonized people without their consent.\n\nThe Eiffel Tower (1887-1889)\n\nThe Eiffel Tower, built especially for the Exposition, was the tallest structure in the world at the time. A competition to build what was simply called “A tower of three hundred meters” with a base one hundred meters wide, was announced in 1886. It was won by the construction firm of Gustave Eiffel, which had recently built the iron frame of the Statue of Liberty. The Eiffel firm had advance knowledge of the project and, beginning in 1884, had already designed a tower exactly to those dimensions. The structural design was created by two Eiffel engineers, Maurice Koechlin and Émile Nouguier, who along with Eiffel himself, received the patent for the plan. An Eiffel architect, Stephen Sauvestre, designed the curving form and decoration which gave the tower its distinctive appearance. Eiffel was granted exclusive rights for twenty years to operate the tower and its restaurants and viewing platforms. A site next to the River was chosen, despite the infiltration of river water, since that land was owned by the City of Paris, and the tower could be kept in place after the Exposition was completed.\n\nThe construction lasted two years, two months and five days, and involved five hundred workers, who assembled eighteen thousand iron pieces, each of five meters and carefully numbered, which had been made at a factory in Levallois-Perret, a Paris suburb. Speaking of the tower construction workers, the son-in-law of Eiffel, declared, “no soldier on the battle field deserved better mention than these humble toilers, who, will never go down in history.” During the Exposition, no one other than construction personnel were allowed higher than the second viewing platform.\n\nIn the first week of the Exposition, 29,922 persons climbed the tower to the viewing platform, though the elevators were not yet in service, and they had to climb by a narrow winding stairway. By the time the Exposition finished, after 173 days, 1,968,287 persons had ascended the tower.\n\nWhen the Exposition ended, the tower was used for a time as a weather station. In 1904, Eiffel proposed to the French military that a radio transmitter, designed by the pioneer radio engineer Edouard Branly, be placed on the third level. In 1909, when Eiffel’s concession formally ended, it was decided to preserve the Tower permanently.\n\nArt Nouveau\n\nThe roots of Art Nouveau can be traced back to the Arts and Crafts Movement in England during the second half of the 19th century. Arts and Crafts is often seen as a response to growing industrialisation in Europe and the rise of factory mass production at the perceived expense of traditional craftsmanship.\n\nEncouraging the organic forms and patterns of Art Nouveau to flow from one object to another, the movement’s theorists championed a greater coordination of art and design.\n\nThe English writer, designer, architect and socialist William Morris (1834-1896) was its defining figure. Morris rejected the tawdry production values and dehumanising aspects of Victorian capitalism, looking instead to the communal values of the medieval era. Morris’s ideals of artisanal craftsmanship, and his use of stylised floral and organic forms, resonated with many Art Nouveau artists.\n\nThey wanted to bring back to humans the capacity to give shapes according to a stronger relation to nature. People were not the focus of the progressive times, but rather the focus were machines and cars. The Art Nouveau movement wanted to change that. The principles of standardisation and mass production detached individuals from nature because you were forced to adapt to machines, hence detaching and furthering you from nature itself.\n\nMorris disdained the working conditions bred by the industrial revolution and abhorred the low-quality bric-a-brac created by factories and amassed in homes of the era.\n\nThe term Art Nouveau first appeared in the Belgian journal L’Art Moderne in 1884, referring to a group of reform-minded sculptors, designers and painters called Les XX (or Les Vingts), whose founder members included James Ensor (1860-1949) and Théo van Rysselberghe (1862-1926). The spirit of the new movement quickly spread around Europe and its name was soon translated in various languages as Jugendstil, Modernismo, Secession, Stile Floreale and similar terms.\n\nFrom the outset, artists working in the Art Nouveau style advocated the unity of all the arts and argued against discrimination between fine art (painting and sculpture) and the so-called lesser, decorative arts. Art Nouveau artists sought to integrate art with the everyday, producing beautiful objects to elevate people’s lives.\n\nPerhaps the person who best expressed Art Nouveau’s steep historical arc, like a flame that burned brightly but briefly, was the young Englishman Aubrey Vincent Beardsley whose perverse sensibilities made him the most controversial figure of Art Nouveau. Finding inspiration in the truculent manner of American expat James Abbott McNeill Whistler and in Henri de Toulouse-Lautrec’s Japoniste posters, Beardsley began his formal artistic career at just 19 years old. The celebrated Pre-Raphaelite painter Sir Edward Burne-Jones would come to shower praise on the untrained Beardsley’s drawings when he saw them in 1891.\n\nBeardsley’s India ink illustrations for Oscar Wilde’s play Salomé established many essential Art Nouveau ideals. Their shadowy imagery, flat decorative patterns, stark contrast, and controlled but swooping lines quickly earned the artist international recognition. Depicting the biblical story of Herod beheading St. John the Baptist at Salomé’s request, the drawing for “J’ai baisé ta bouche, Iokanaan” drips with erotic imagery: folds of fabric, streams of blood, and tendrils of hair. At lower right, a flower evocatively blooms in the darkness, while a black passage at upper left seems to reverberate with the dark thoughts of a scowling Salomé. Thanks to his formal talents—not to mention his propensity for erotic and sometimes pornographic subject matter—Beardsley became a touchstone for some of Art Nouveau’s most recognizable artists, despite his early death from tuberculosis in 1898.\n\nWhile Beardsley was an untrained prodigy, Gustav Klimt attended the Vienna School of Arts and Crafts (Kunstgewerbeschule) and began his career as the establishment wunderkind. Klimt’s early works, such as his murals for the new Burgtheater in Vienna’s Ringstrasse, fulfilled academic and bourgeois expectations for art with their naturalistic depictions of historical scenes.\n\nBut not all of Klimt’s work fit such orthodox constraints. The atmosphere of erotic love and sexuality that pervaded Vienna around 1900 exerted a powerful influence on the artist. Like the philosopher Friedrich Nietzsche, Klimt saw the artist as a messenger of truth, not fantasy. In 1894, he undertook a commission for murals in the assembly hall of the University of Vienna. Rather than representing the field of Medicine in a logical or sanitized way, as he was expected to do, Klimt portrayed confusion and darkness, knotting together naked bodies and juxtaposing pregnant stomachs with veiled skeletons.\n\nThe scandal that ensued ultimately ended Klimt’s academic career, prompting him to found and serve as the first president of the Sezession, the radical Art Nouveau group in Vienna that brought together artists, designers, and architects. They collaborated in the principle of a Gesamtkunstwerk, or “total work of art,” which aimed to be spiritually uplifting through a combination of beauty and utility. Josef Hoffman’s design for the dining room of Brussels’s Palais Stoclet, which included Klimt’s spiral-filled arboreal murals, exemplified this goal.\n\nIt was his iconic portraiture style, however, that earned him a place in art’s historic pantheon. The Kiss (1907), perhaps his most famous work, displays the basic but revolutionary elements of his distinctive idiom: a flattening of form and rich design flourishes within patches of gold leaf applied to the canvas. Representing love as an alignment of surfaces, The Kiss locks the central figures in concentric shapes, entwining lovers’ bodies like jewels in a gold ring. They embrace, a shimmering cloak surrounding them like a membrane, and a wall of flowers falls away. This anxious eroticism for which Klimt is known infused the work of subsequent artists, including his protégé Egon Schiele.\n\nMeanwhile in the USA\n\nThe decorative arts formed another cornerstone of Art Nouveau’s legacy. While France was home to many notable figures—Georges de Feure, Édouard Colonna, and Eugène Gaillard, among others—on the other side of the Atlantic, Louis Comfort Tiffany became the name most associated with the Art Nouveau movement in the United States.\n\nHeir to the silver empire of Tiffany & Co., a company founded by his father, Charles Lewis Tiffany, in 1837, Tiffany started his career as a painter. After studying under George Inness, he began working with decorative art in the 1870s. Supported by enthusiastic patrons in New York, he produced elaborate interiors and complementary metalwork, enamels, lighting, and jewelry.\n\nBut Tiffany (as well as his leading competitor, John LaFarge) was best known for an innovative fabrication of leaded glass that became a distinctly American phenomenon. By 1881, his experiments in chemistry had led to the development of glass with an opalescent finish that produced a dreamy, milky quality of light. Surviving features from Tiffany’s elaborate estate on Long Island, Laurelton Hall, reveal his work in full bloom, with windows, ceramic tile, and architectural features coalescing into a garden-like alcove. Staining his glass in an array of colors and adding finely painted details to it prior to firing, Tiffany created a revolutionary look that was hugely successful and allowed the company to expand into the empire of decorative art and jewelry that continues today.\n\nParis Metro entrance’s by Hector Guimard\n\nBetween 1900 and 1913, Hector Guimard was responsible for the first generation of entrances to the underground stations of the Paris Métro. His Art Nouveau designs in cast iron and glass dating mostly to 1900, and the associated lettering that he also designed, created what became known as the Métro style (style Métro) and popularized Art Nouveau. However, arbiters of style were scandalized and the public was also less enamored of his more elaborate entrances. In 1904 his design for the Opéra station at Place de l’Opéra was rejected and his association with the Métro ended; many of his station entrances have been demolished, including all three of the pavilion type (at Bastille and on Avenue de Wagram at Étoile). Those that remain are now all protected historical monuments, one has been reconstituted, and some originals and replicas also survive outside France.\n\nThe initial network of the Paris Métropolitain (soon commonly abbreviated to “Métro”) was planned and built at one time in order to minimize disruption to the city from on-going construction and to open Line 1 and two branches in time for the Exposition Universelle in 1900. A design competition was held for the above-ground components, to alleviate the public’s fear that they would mar the cityscape with an industrial appearance. The new entrances were stipulated to be “as elegant as possible but above all very light, prioritising iron, glass and ceramic”. However, the submitted entries were all too bulky for many of the sidewalk sites. Adrien Bénard, the financier whose bank was underwriting the construction, liked the new Art Nouveau style and therefore instead persuaded the Compagnie du chemin de fer métropolitain de Paris (CMP) to appoint the still young Hector Guimard to design the entrances to the underground stations, while the elevated stations were designed by Jean-Camille Formigé, chief architect of the City of Paris.\n\nRather than stone, Guimard used cast iron set in concrete both to reduce costs and to suit the sinuous Art Nouveau forms; they were painted in a green emulating weathered brass.\n\nWhy does Art Nouveau Matter?\n\nThe success of Tiffany and other decorative artists testifies to Art Nouveau’s goal of tearing down hierarchies between the arts. The rise of print and graphic arts similarly advanced this cause and, unlike Tiffany’s more rarified creations, they could be reproduced to enrich the lives of a broader public. Czech artist Alphonse Mucha’s representations of la femme nouvelle (the bold new woman) are illustrative of the emerging medium of graphic advertisements, as are those of Jules Cheret, whose distinctive Belle Époque designs led to his being considered the father of the modern poster. Even talented painters like Henri de Toulouse-Lautrec and Jan Toorop became as renowned for their graphic art as for their canvases.\n\nFollowing the vision of Eugène-Emmanuel Viollet-le-Duc, architects used steel and other modern materials to create new vocabularies featuring arched and cantilevered forms. The breathtaking Tassel House by Henry van de Velde and Victor Horta, the latter a gifted Belgian disciple of both Morris and Viollet-le-Duc, remains a highpoint of this fluid architectural design. Other outstanding examples came from Charles Rennie Mackintosh and Margaret Macdonald in Scotland; Otto Wagner in Austria; Louis Sullivan in the United States; and the inimitable Antoni Gaudí, known for Casa Mila and Sagrada Familia, in Spanish Catalonia.\n\nArt Nouveau bridged an essential gap between 19th-century aestheticism and 20th-century design. Wassily Kandinsky and Ernst Ludwig Kirchner, for example, two iconic modern painters, worked in Jugendstil before moving toward their own personal styles. But, just as quickly as it had blossomed across the Western aesthetic landscape, Art Nouveau began to wither in the early 20th century. Ultimately, the movement’s reputation for decadence drove an unintended wedge between wealthy patrons and skilled workers. The flowing, floral character that had once been praised became its liability, leading the English illustrator Walter Crane to condemn it as a “strange decorative disease” as early as 1903.\n\nHenry Ford – Model T (1908 USA)\n\nThe Model T, sold by the Ford Motor Company from 1908 to 1927, was the earliest effort to make a car that most people could actually buy. Modern cars were first built in 1885 in Germany by Karl Benz, and the first American cars in Springfield, Massachusetts in 1893 by Charles and Frank Duryea. But just because they were available didn’t mean that ordinary people could afford them.\n\nThe Model T was actually affordable and it became so popular at one point that a majority of Americans owned one, directly helping rural Americans become more connected with the rest of the country and leading to the numbered highway system. The manufacturing needs of the Model T went hand in hand with Ford’s revolutionary modernization of the manufacturing process.\n\nBy day he was chief engineer at Edison Illuminating Company of Detroit, but at night Henry Ford labored over a gasoline engine. He successfully tested one on Christmas Eve, 1893, with the help of his wife, Clara, taking a break from Christmas cooking. The engine worked for 30 seconds, long enough to confirm for Ford that he was on the right track.\n\nFord kept prices low by sticking to a single product. By building just one model, for example, the company’s engineers could develop a system of interchangeable parts that reduced waste, saved time and made it easy for unskilled workers to assemble the cars. By 1914, the moving assembly line made it possible to produce thousands of cars every week and by 1924, workers at the River Rouge Ford plant in Dearborn, Michigan could cast more than 10,000 Model T cylinder blocks in a day.\n\nThus making it the first car in history to be developed and produced entirely in an industrial way, it changed everything.\n\nIt was the longest production run of any automobile model in history until the Volkswagen Beetle surpassed it in 1972.\n\nPeter Behrens\n\nPeter Behrens (14 April 1868 – 27 February 1940) was a leading German architect, graphic and industrial designer, best known for his early pioneering AEG Turbine Hall in Berlin in 1909. He had a long career, designing objects, typefaces, and important buildings in a range of styles from the 1900s to the 1930s.\n\nBehrens was an architect of the transformations, he moved fluently from one discipline to another: painting, graphic design, furniture design and architecture.\n\nBorn in Hamburg, Behrens moved to Munich in 1890 where he began his career as a painter, illustrator and bookbinder. In these years, he was part of Munich’s art scene, and generally worked in the popular style of the time, Jugendstil (Art Nouveau). In 1899, Behrens was invited by the Grand-duke Ernst-Ludwig of Hesse to Darmstadt Artists’ Colony, where he was offered the opportunity to build his own house.\n\nThe resulting building Behrens’ first work of architecture is indebted to Art Nouveau in some of its features, but it is more remarkable for the way in which it deviates from Art Nouveau norms.\n\nIn 1907, Behrens teamed with ten other artists and designers and a group of twelve companies to create the Deutscher Werkbund, an organization that was deliberately designed to compete with the English Arts and Crafts movement, and to improve the status of German design and industry.\n\nAs a result of this organization, Behrens was employed by AEG as an artistic consultant and called upon to design everything from the company’s logos and typefaces to its product design, effectively making Behrens the world’s first industrial designer.\n\nIn the process he turned away from the fashionable Art Nouveau style towards a more austere type of design.\n\nAEG Turbin Hall (Berlin 1908-1909)\n\nIf asked to name buildings by German architect and designer Peter Behrens (14 April 1868 – 27 February 1940), few people would be able to answer with anything other than his AEG Turbine Factory in Berlin.\n\nHe designed the classical-style AEG Turbine Factory (see below), raising the question whether classical designs formerly reserved for temples and the like, were appropriate for ultra-functional industrial buildings.\n\nDespite this, Behrens’ achievements are not to be underestimated, and his importance to the development of architecture might best be understood by looking at three young architects who worked in his studio around 1910: Le Corbusier, Mies van der Rohe, and Walter Gropius.\n\nBehrens’ great legacy in design is his effort to bring dignity to the workplace. The AEG Turbine Factory is the crowing achievement in that quest, a building of glass and steel with a monumental facade.\n\nThe AEG turbine factory was built around 1909, in the Berlin district of Moabit. It is an influential and well-known example of industrial architecture. Its revolutionary design features 100m long and 15m tall glass and Steel walls on either sides. A bold move and world first that would have a durable impact on Architecture as a whole.\n\nBuilt in just a few months in 1909 in glass, iron, and concrete as an enormous modern industrial production space – the largest iron construction in Berlin at the time, with an enclosed volume of around 150,000 cubic meters uninterrupted by internal supports – today, more than a hundred years later, it still fulfills its original function, the assembly of large industrial turbines.\n\nThe Turbine Factory has long been hailed as representing the integration of industrial building types and modern construction methods and materials into the tradition of architecture, and an artistic elevation of the modern workplace and the world of industry into the realm of culture. It constitutes an attempt at reconciling the modern disciplines of architecture and engineering – or, as Behrens would put it, creating a new unity between art and technology – and one of its historical achievements is that it marks a new beginning in artists’ and architects’ engagement with the sites and products of modern industry in the early twentieth century.\n\nThe building is one of the most significant of proto-rationalism and one of the first in the utilization of industrialized elements in architecture. The industrial building has a modular and rectangular ground plan and the Behrens’ subsequent industrial buildings are predicated on it and became a milestone within this type of construction.\n\nBehrens conceived a building made of steel and glass that shared the prospect of its owner, Emil Rathenau, a building that showed his prosperity. Meanwhile, Behrens hoped to achieve the harmonious tradition of the Greek and Egyptian temples, with a clear desire of celebrate the industry power.\n\nAgainst all the “materialism”, Behrens focused his project on the certainty of the artist and art power. As an outcome, he obtained a glass wall that represents the victory of art over the banality of life in an increasingly industrialized society.\n\nMaterials and vision\n\nThe mean materials used in this building were glass and steel, with trees holding rubblework in the metallic arcs.\n\nThe main Behrens obstacle, in aesthetic terms, was the glass and steel facade tectonics proposed by the engineer Karl Bernhard to control the structure and be able to carry out the idea of “Stereotomie”, which Behrens defended since the Oldenburg’s Art Exhibition. That turned into an ideological and technological change, in which unavoidably Behrens made forced concessions to Bernhard.\n\nThe building is considered as the first integral industrial integral design of the history. The plan has a basement, a ground floor and a first floor.\n\nWalter Gropius and Adolf Meyer\n\nWalter Adolph Georg Gropius (18 May 1883 – 5 July 1969) was a German-American architect and founder of the Bauhaus School, who, along with Alvar Aalto, Ludwig Mies van der Rohe, Le Corbusier and Frank Lloyd Wright, is widely regarded as one of the pioneering masters of modernist architecture. He is a founder of Bauhaus in Weimar (1919). Gropius was also a leading architect of the International Style.\n\nMore about Walter Gropius\n\nAdolf Meyer (17 June, 1881 – 14 July, 1929) was a German architect.\n\nA student and employee of both Bruno Paul and Peter Behrens, Meyer became the office boss of the firm of Walter Gropius around 1915 and a full partner afterwards. In 1919 Gropius appointed Meyer as a master at the Bauhaus, where he taught work drawing and construction technique. Meyer is also credited as co-designer of the Gropius entry for the 1922 Chicago Tribune Tower competition.\n\nMore about Adolf Meyer\n\nFagus Factory (Alfeld on the Leine, Germany 1911-1913)\n\nCommissioned by owner Carl Benscheidt who wanted a radical structure to express the company’s break from the past, the factory was designed by Walter Gropius and Adolf Meyer. It was constructed between 1911 and 1913, with additions and interiors completed in 1925.\n\nThe building that had the greatest influence on the Fagus factory design was the 1909 AEG turbine factory in Berlin, designed by Peter Behrens.\n\nGropius and Meyer had both worked on the project and with the Fagus factory they presented their interpretation and criticism of their teacher’s work.\n\nThe Fagus main building can be seen as an inversion of the AEG turbine factory.\n\nBoth have corners free of supports, and glass surfaces between piers that cover the whole height of the building. However, in the AEG turbine factory the corners are covered by heavy elements that slant inside. The glass surfaces also slant inside and are recessed in relation to the piers. The load-bearing elements are attenuated and the building has an image of stability and monumentality. In the Fagus factory exactly the opposite happens; the corners are left open and the piers are recessed leaving the glass surface to the front.\n\nAt the time of the design of the Fagus factory, Gropius was collecting photographs of industrial buildings in the USA to be used for a Deutscher Werkbund publication. The design of these American factories was also a source of inspiration for Fagus.\n\n“Train stations, department stores and factories demand their own modern expression and can no longer be executed in the style of the previous centuries, without succumbing to empty schematic forms and historical frippery. Precisely determined forms that are devoid of everything arbitrary, clear contrast, well-ordered members, serial rows of similar elements and the unity of form and colour are the basis for the rhythm of modern architectural creation.”\n\nWalter Gropius\n\nThe Fagus factory project was Walter Gropius’s first project and is considered one of the earliest and most important architectural works of the modern movement of the early part of the 20th century.\n\nDeutscher Werkbund (Germany, 1907)\n\nThe Deutscher Werkbund (English: “German Association of Craftsmen” is a German association of artists, architects, designers and industrialists established in 1907.\n\nThe Werkbund became an important element in the development of modern architecture and industrial design, particularly in the later creation of the Bauhaus school of design.\n\nIts initial purpose was to establish a partnership of product manufacturers with design professionals to improve the competitiveness of German companies in global markets.\n\nThe Werkbund was less an artistic movement than a state-sponsored effort to integrate traditional crafts and industrial mass productiontechniques, to put Germany on a competitive footing with England and the United States. Its motto Vom Sofakissen zum Städtebau (from sofa cushions to city-building) indicates its range of interest.\n\nWerkbund members believed that unity and beauty of form was an essential achievement of civilized culture and saw industrialization as a force that demanded a recalibration of German aesthetic standards. They believed that German designers needed to shift their focus toward designing solely objects that could be mass produced, that the form of an object should be derived from its functional logic, and that each object should be honest about its materials.\n\nIn conclusion the Werkbund expanded on the English Arts and Crafts movement, adopting concerns that craft and design influenced people’s lives and propagating a rejection of historicism in favour of vernacular architecture suited to the modern age.\n\nGlass House/Pavilion (1914)\n\nand the first Werkbund Exibition\n\nThe first Werkbund Exhibition of 1914 was held at Rheinpark in Cologne, Germany. Bruno Taut‘s best-known building, the prismatic dome of the Glass Pavilion of which only black and white images survive today, was in reality a brightly colored landmark.\n\nPlanning began in earnest in 1912, and construction work started in early 1914. The exhibition was opened to the public by Van de Velde on 15 May 1914. Scheduled to last until the end of October, it was prematurely shut down on 8 August following the outbreak of World War I a week earlier; the exhibition buildings were dismantled shortly afterwards.\n\nIn the statement of Colonia 1914, the Werkbund provided an architect’s work, Glass House, a successful fusion of technical and commercial aesthetic elements. During the exhibition, the architect made ​​numerous debates explaining new concepts of modern architecture, and the Glass Pavilion became the best example of the same.\n\nThe German Werkbund members of the group, particularly Taut, were convinced that light and transparency were the main features of an ideal architecture of the future. This project was a first attempt to give form to that ideal.\n\nThe structure made by Bruno Taut demonstrated the many ways in which the glass could be used in construction, but also hinted as the material could be used to organize the human emotions and help in construction of a spiritual utopia.\n\nThe interest Taut demonstrated in the spiritual aspect with the use of glass, transparency and light, explored more intensively during World War II and later in his book Architecture Alpina, was stimulated by writer Paul Scheerbart who advocated a paradise land, based on the new architecture of glass and color.\n\nThe Glass Pavilion is one of the buildings that best combines ancient tradition, represented by its dome and appearance of the temple, with the modern tradition highlighted by the materials used.\n\nThe design was an explosion of color with an interior whose floor was glass and the walls and windows decorated with mirrored mosaics. Information on the glass industry which sponsored the project was also included.\n\nThe dome targeted feature double glass pavilion rests on a circular plan in which 14 lintels rise mid-rise with side brackets framing the same number of glass walls. In the concrete structure of the facades had plates inlaid with colored glass acting as mirrors.\n\nThe structure of the Pavilion was built on a concrete pedestal, whose two entrances on both sides of the building are achieved up two flights of stairs, which gives the same appearance of the temple.\n\nTaut called on architects to follow him into the contemporary Expressionist painters in seeking a new artistic spirit, he wanted to create a building with a different structure, and similar to Gothic Cathedrals. Bruno said that his building didn’t have any real function, it was more to provoke something in someone than a practical building.\n\nThe Glass Pavilion or “Glashaus” was one of the first exhibition building designed as a mechanism to create vivid experiences, where people would be able to feel, touch and primarily see.\n\nThe goal of this functionless building as that architecture would include the other arts of painting and sculpture, to achieve a new, unified expression.\n\n“The longing for purity and clarity, for glowing lightness and crystalline exactness, for immaterial lightness and infinite liveliness found a means of its fulfillment in glass—the most ineffable, most elementary, most flexible and most changeable of materials, richest in meaning and inspiration, fusing with the world like no other. This least fixed of materials transforms itself with every change of atmosphere. It is infinitely rich in elations, mirroring what is above, below, and what is below, above. It is animated, full of spirit and alive … It is an example of a transcendent passion to build, functionless, free, satisfying no practical demands—and yet a functional building, soulful, awakening spiritual inspirations—an ethical functional building”\n\nAdolf Behne (art critic, historian, activist)\n\nThis building was made into an installation, a symbol, a mystical sign and a start for a new world view and future architecture.\n\nBauhaus\n\nBauhaus (Dessau)\n\nUnifay industrialisation with arts and crafts\n\nEstablish a new culture of modern design\n\nArt Deco and Le Corbusier\n\nKey words: comparison, saving space, architecture, hygiene, ergonomics, functionality, decoration, colour, steel.\n\nWhat happened after the war? What styles and important figures have appeared, what’s new? Are there any new movements?\n\nThe Art Deco Movement\n\nWhat is Art Deco exactly and how can we distinguish between this particular style and similar types of decorative art? Art Deco characteristics are easily distinguishable. We usually recognize Art Deco designs and objects intuitively, once we see them, but when it comes to the definition of this visual arts style, things tend to be a little more complicated.\n\nFirst of all, there are different national variants of Art Deco and the Art Deco style itself is often described as a pastiche of styles and an eclectic combination of influences, materials, and shapes. Therefore, it is sometimes hard to distinguish Art Deco from similar schools like Art Nouveau, Art Moderne, Bauhaus school, or Arts and Crafts movement.\n\nHowever, there are certain characteristics that can help us decide whether we are looking at Art Deco artworks and in the next couple of paragraphs, we will try to establish those essential and typical features of Art Deco, exploring the characteristics of this decorative style in its various forms, from visual arts and Art Deco paintings to design and architecture.\n\nWhen we talk about Art Deco definition, we usually tell that it was certainly one of the most influential decorative styles in the first half of the twentieth century.\n\nIt first appeared in France in the 1920’s taking its name from 1925 Exposition Internationale des Arts Décoratifs et Industriels Modernes. After its debut in Paris, Art Deco style was quickly accepted around the world, drawing from the different sources and affecting various disciplines, from visual and decorative arts to fashion, architecture, filmography and product design.\n\nAlthough it was the most popular movement in the period between two World Wars, it wasn’t recognized as a movement in its own right until the sixties and some art historians even today argue whether Art Deco movement existed as such and if it should be identified as a distinct style.\n\nLuxurious and splendid in their appearance, Art Deco paintings and designs marked the period of newly found optimism after the war and great depression. Although it drew its inspiration from the past art movements, one of the main features of Art Deco style was its orientation towards the future and celebration of modern ideas of progress.\n\nMore about the Art Deco movement later in this post and here.\n\n“Rue des Boutiques“\n\nMaurice Dufrêne transformed the Seine bridge into a line of boutiques that showcased the products of that time. The Art Deco movement was more oriented and related to craftsmanship and art, opposing the other movements going on which were more oriented to the industrial production/revolution. With that we have to opposing visions. Le Corbusier showed us another side of these revolutions (trough art not industrialisation).\n\nThe social relations of Art Deco: promoting consumer goods for certain people, wealthy people at that. With that some words associated with Art Deco were art, craftsmanship and luxury. However on the other side of the story we have Bauhaus and Le Corbusier who wanted to make a new middle class. With that said we have two different visions on the development of social classes.\n\nThe general standards for the two movements were:\n\n1. Art Deco – the furniture is art in-itself, a luxury product only the wealthy can afford; appealing to the wealthy.\n\n2. Le Corbusier and Bauhaus – determined in providing pleasure and affordable housing and furnishing.\n\nArt Deco became the style choice for the interwar generation (the generation of this time has a lot of names some of them being: “The Jazz Age”, “Decade of the Flapper”, “Interwar Generation”, etc.).\n\nThe peculiar case of Eileen Gray\n\n“Eileen Gray’s designs are now as familiar as designs from the other important early 20th Century architects and designers such as Le Corbusier, Mies van der Rohe, Marcel Breuer et al”\n\nZeev Aram, Chairman, Aram Designs Ltd\n\nThe official site made in her memory: www.eileengray.co.uk\n\nEileen Gray (born Kathleen Eileen Moray Smith; 9 August 1878 – 31 October 1976) was an Irish architect and furniture designer and a pioneer of the Modern Movement in architecture. Her most famous work is the house known as E-1027 in Roquebrune-Cap-Martin, France (about which we will speak later on in the presentation).\n\nAt the time in which Eileen was working on her design and architecture projects there was an evolution from an Art Deco approach to a more modern approach.\n\nShe worked alone — painting, interior design, the Japanese craft of lacquerwork, designing furniture, making rugs, and selling her wares at her own boutiques. It is a strange phenomenon – her talent went unquestioned, her pieces were popular, she had passionate love affairs with both men and women, yet amid the clamour of her contemporaries, Gray is quiet, industrious. As art critic Brian Dillon writes, “the real drama was in her work”.\n\nMore about the Bibendum chair: Eileen Gray’s Bibendum chair.\n\nPolished chromium plated tubular steel base. Fully upholstered seat, back and armrests covered in fabric or leather in various colours.\n\nThe chair was designed for a French hat designer, Madame Mathieu Lévy owner of a highly successful boutique selling extremely stylish hats. The name that Gray chose for the chair, Bibendum, originates from the character created by Michelin to sell tyres. The Michelin Man is called “Bibendum”, a word taken from the slogan “Nunc est bibendum” meaning “Now is the time to drink”. In this particular case, to “drink”, or absorb, bumps and obstacles found on the road.\n\nShe was also jesting that this was her response as a feminist to Le Corbusier’s ‘Grand Confort’, as his chair was “too rough” she wanted to add curves and a soft feminine touch to the design. It was an attempt to work with smooth shapes against the more regular shapes proposed by German designers and Le Corbusier himself.\n\nThe geometrically structured small dressing table was designed for her summerhouse E1027. The drawers in the small side box of the Petite Coiffeuse swivel out. Everything is reduced to the essentials, but it is all within easy reach.\n\nDressing table consisting of tabletop and suspended box with two swivel-out drawers and one door. Frame of chromium-plated steel tubing. Tabletop and box of MDF high-gloss lacquer finish.\n\nThere is another story wihich states: This dressing table and the Castellar mirror were designed for a small flat in Paris. Although there was very little room, she held that no ‘self-respecting lady’ would not have at least a ‘petite coiffeuse’. The pivoting drawers were an innovation at the time, and ‘a bit of an experiment’.\n\nE-1027 House: A Tale of Architecture and Scandal\n\nE-1027 House, Eileen Gray, Jean Badovici, Roquebrune-Cap-Martin, France, 1926-1929\n\nIn late 1920 the architect and designer Eileen Gray, designed and built by the sea the E-1027 House, which would become a landmark of modern architecture. It was built as a summer residence to share with her lover, critic Jean Badovici. The name of the house, E-1027, sounds impersonal, there is a resulting numerical code to combine your initials, “E” for Eileen, 10 for Jean, 2 for Badovici, 7 for Gray.\n\nShe lifted the house on an isolated stretch of the Riviera, on the west side of Cap Martin, overlooking the bay of Monaco. The architect chose this location for its beautiful views and built the house directly on the ground.\n\nGray wanted to build a house that interact with the natural elements around her, carefully studied the wind and the angle of the sun at different times of day and year, and thus was able to build a structure with a constant evolution, following his relation to the sun, wind and sea.\n\nThe structure is raised on piles, slender white columns that Le Corbusier had made famous, spaces flow seamlessly with each other, and out on the terraces and balconies of the spacious rooms. Its white walls, strong horizontality, decks, its winding railing and sparse furnishings make it seem a boat docked, floating between landscape and sea. Gray designed housing so that the inside and outside to flow together.\n\nBuilt over three years in collaboration with Badovici ­– E1027 is a cryptic expression of their union – the building is informed by Le Corbusier’s notion of the “house as a machine for living in” yet diverges from the rigidity of his theories in its prioritisation of the personal. “Formulas are nothing”, Gray said. “People are everything” and E1027 is a home constructed around the personalities of people. And not just the structure. There is the adjustable E1027 table, designed for her sister who loved to eat breakfast in bed but hated the crumbs, the trolley that muted rattling cups, the soft curves of the Bibendum chair, the simplicity of the Transat deckchair. She believed that “architecture must be its own decoration” so the walls remained white, and instead the sun, the land, the sea, were ushered in. The result was gentle equanimity, a fusion of art and nature, the peace she so desired.\n\nBut not for long. Gray and her lover split soon after the house was completed – while Gray craved peace, Badovici, it seems, craved the hedonism he had left behind in Paris – and she moved further along the coast. In the late 1930s, Le Corbusier came to stay with Badovici and was permitted to daub the pristine walls with obscene and lurid murals, a deed Gray viewed as an act of brazen aggression against her work and theories. Le Corbusier painted eight large murals both inside and outside the house, some of which contained sexual imagery. Gray’s supporters feel the architect deliberately defaced the work of his rival, but due to Le Corbusier’s greater fame, the murals have been preserved. His obsession with the house is well documented; having defaced the property, he tried and failed to buy it several times, eventually building a ‘cabanon’ on the perimeter to allow him to forever lurk nearby. He drowned in the sea in front of E1027 in 1965, the house perhaps the last thing he ever saw.\n\nWhile Le Corbusier became the most famous and influential of the early modernists, Gray’s career was largely forgotten until after her death in 1976.\n\nThe controversial Le Corbusier\n\n(After this brief introduction there will be more about Le Corbusier and his work later on in the presentation so stay with me)\n\nSwiss-born Charles-Édouard Jeanneret (6 October 1887 – 27 August 1965), best known by his adopted name Le Corbusier, was a highly influential architect, designer, painter, urban planner and writer whose career spanned almost five decades. A pioneer of progress-minded modern architecture, Le Corbusier sought to impose a rational order on the chaos of the world through design. He rejected the excessive architectural ornament and developed a style that became known as Brutalism, creating buildings with elemental geometric forms that were made of industrial materials such as steel and reinforced concrete. Le Corbusier believed that pure, well-designed spaces could offer a lesson in how little is needed to achieve happiness. To convey this notion, the architect prioritized modern, open interiors and emphasized light, rational designs. His architecture and interiors share a clear sense of space and structural order, underlining the beauty in harmony, proportion and simplicity.\n\nHe was born in Switzerland and became a French citizen in 1930. His career spanned five decades, and he designed buildings in Europe, Japan, India, and North and South America. As he was dedicated to providing better living conditions for the residents of crowded cities, Le Corbusier was influential in urban planning, and was a founding member of the Congrès International d’Architecture Moderne (CIAM).\n\nWorking alongside Le Corbusier: Discovering Pierre Jeanneret\n\nLet’s start from the beginning. Who is Pierre Bergeret? Pierre Bergeret (22 March 1896 – 4 December 1967) was a Swiss architect who collaborated with his cousin, Charles-Édouard Jeanneret (who assumed the pseudonym Le Corbusier), for about twenty years. His name was surely overshadowed by the great fame of his cousin with whom, however, he collaborated permanently starting in 1922, signing some of Le Corbusier’s most iconic projects such as Villa Savoye or the house in Paris, now home to Le Corbusier Foundation.\n\nJeanneret’s contribution to the partnership was considerable, not least in introducing professionalism in following through projects and work on site – he often stimulated and provoked his cousin’s imagination or moderated it with his own realism. He frequently drew the first sketches for plans that he then gradually reworked and refined with Le Corbusier, playing an important part in ensuring the office’s continuity, coordinating work and maintaining tight control over all the technical aspects.\n\nIn 1922, the Jeanneret cousins set up an architectural practice together. From 1927 to 1937 they worked together with Charlotte Perriand at the Le Corbusier-Pierre Jeanneret studio, rue de Sèvres.\n\nIn the early 1950s Jeanneret joined his cousin in Chandigarh, India, where they embarked on a massive urban-planning project, laying out the city and designing low-cost buildings and furniture. Though Corbusier abandoned the project halfway through, Jeanneret remained for 15 years as the project’s chief architect. The city remains a masterpiece of the modern vision.\n\nJeanneret, in collaboration with the English husband-wife team of Maxwell Fry and Jane Drew, was responsible for much of Chandigarh‘s large civic architecture project. His most remarkable contribution has undoubtedly been the designing of the fourteen categories of mass-housings that constitute the living and amenity areas of Chandigarh.\n\nPierre Jeanneret also had the task of designing the interiors and furnishings of many of the buildings in Chandigart. The sensitivity of Pierre Jeanneret towards supporting local industry and craftsmanship led him to try to combine the essential and minimal style of his designs, in line with most European modernist ideals, with local materials such as Teak Burma (cheap , resistant to moisture and also to insects). The simple designs of Pierre Jeanneret and the use of cheap local materials allowed the mass production of beautiful but at the same time convenient furnishings.\n\nIn addition to buildings, Jeanneret also designed furniture, both independently and with Le Corbusier. He experimented with minimalist design, including a chair which required no fasteners.\n\nJeanneret’s finest work in furniture was done in Chandigarh, and these are the pieces that have earned him recent renown. Crafted of teak, the designs range from low-slung lounge chairs and armchairs with cane seats to desks and tables, most with Jeanneret’s signature drafting compass-shaped legs.\n\nConversely, while Jeanneret uses essentially geometric forms for his wooden seating pieces, they exude warmth by nature of the material. One of his first manufactured designs in wood is the Model 92 Scissors chair, licensed by Hans and Florence Knoll when they were touring postwar France.\n\nIcons of 20th Century : Charlotte Perriand\n\nThe art of living: 10 things to know about Charlotte Perriand\n\nCharlotte Perriand (24 October 1903 – 27 October 1999) was a French architect and designer. Her work aimed to create functional living spaces in the belief that better design helps in creating a better society.\n\nShe had full membership of the avant-garde cultural movement which, from the first decades of the twentieth century, brought a profound change in aesthetic values and gave birth to a truly modern sensitivity towards everyday life. In this context, her specific contribution focuses on interior composition, conceived as creating a new way of living, still today at the heart of contemporary lifestyle.\n\n” There is one thing I never did and that was flirt. That is, I didn’t ‘dabble,’ I created and produced, and my job was important.”\n\nShe rejected the popular Beaux-Arts style and found inspiration instead in machine-age technology. She joined the studio of Le Corbusier at 24, where she experimented with steel, aluminium, and glass, developing a series of tubular steel chairs that remain a modern icon.\n\n“The most important thing to realise is that what drives the modern movement is a spirit of enquiry; it’s a process of analysis and not a style,” she said near the end of her life. “We worked with ideals.”\n\nThe ten-year long collaboration with Le Corbusier and Pierre Jeanneret, and her Japanese experience, represent periods of intense creative effervescence in the life of the artist. During her long stay in the Far East (1940-1946), she reveals her artistic talent to the full, through a reinterpretation of the reality of life to echo both tradition and modernity.\n\nBy way of example, worthy of mention are the furnishings produced using traditional bamboo processing techniques, capable of enhancing the new forms already experimented using steel-tubing.\n\n“It’s a shame people only know her as a woman who simply designed furniture for Corbusier – not just for her, but for women of the 20th century. […] People need to see how she designed spaces and the synthesis with art,” he continued. “She was able to work from the scale of a spoon to the masterplanning of a city.”\n\nCherruet told Dezeen\n\nThe “Ombre” chair was first exhibited in 1955 at the exhibition ‘Synthèse des Arts’ in Tokyo. During this exhibition, Charlotte Perriand presented a selection of her latest creations, accompanied by works by Le Corbusier and Fernand Léger. This exhibition took place in the large Takashimaya Stores, which had already hosted her first exhibition of objects and furniture in 1941: ‘Selection, Tradition, Creation’.\n\nThis “Ombre” chair was a real aesthetic achievement for the time, since it was made from a single element of wood, pre-cut in some places. By adapting to a long tradition of plywood, which is ancestral in Japan, Charlotte Perriand brought a form and a modern design that completely transforms this low chair.\n\nThis piece above is part of the pieces made in Japan, around 1955, with some of them recovered later by the Galerie Steph Simon.\n\nMaison du Thé, Charlotte Perriand, Paris, 1993\n\nCharlotte Perriand read ‘The Book of Tea’ while she lived in Japan and Vietnam during the II War World. Both the book and the years of exile had a huge impact on her ideas and her design skills. Long time after her return to France in 1946 she was commissioned by her friend Hiroshi Teshigaharato design a Teahouse to be part of the Japanese Cultural Festival held in Paris in 1993. Her proposal was to be located on the rooftop of the UNESCO headquarters, along with other Tea houses designed by Tadao Ando, Ettore Sottsass and Yae Lun Choi.\n\nPerriand´s design was extraordinary simple and rich at the same time. By using traditional materials such as pine wood and bamboo, natural elements like stones and water and her knowledge on Japanese culture, she presented a proposal that provided the quiet and peaceful atmosphere that the tea ceremony requires.\n\nYou can read more about the Maison du Thé here.\n\nCharlotte Perriand deserves a spotlight of her own. Learn more about her trough these illustrations by Violeta Noy (violetanoy.com)\n\nTo celebrate the 20th anniversary of Charlotte Perriand’s death, Paris Fondation Louis Vuitton devoted a compelling exhibition to her from October 2, 2019 to February 24, 2020. Read more about the exhibition and her work here.\n\nThe three collaborators\n\nIn 1922, Le Corbusier began working in the new rue de Sèvres, Paris, atelier with his cousin Pierre Jeanneret with whom he shared research projects and design criteria in a profound and life-long professional relationship.\n\nIn October 1927, the pair decided to draw on the contribution of a young architect who had already begun to establish a reputation on the architectural scene of the time: Charlotte Perriand.\n\nTheir collaboration lasted through to 1937 and was extremely fruitful, especially in the field of furniture design. The partnership was highly significant, both in terms of the cultural weight of their achievements and their professional successes.It was together with Charlotte Perriand that the pair tackled the innovative project for “l’équipement d’intérieur de l’habitation”.\n\nThe 1929 Salon d’Automne showcased some of their most important models, such as the LC1,LC2 and LC3 armchairs, the LC6 table and the LC4 chaise-longe.\n\nFirst chair notable for the back attached to the front with a rod (offering continuous support with the movement of the body).\n\nAs it is made from steel and natural skin it gives off a sleek feel and an elegant look.\n\nThe balance between form and function is achieved through the use of the Modulor, a system based on the typical measurements of the male body and on a mathematical language informed by the proportions of universal harmony. Its perfect compositional simplicity, suited to any context, is available in three versions.\n\nAs with all of Le Corbusier’s works, the LC1 derives from an in-depth study of human posture. In this particular case, the chair is intended to be relaxing and to foster conversation.\n\nThe LC2 armchair has played a role in the history of furniture design, becoming a worldwide icon.\n\nCreated to enhance conversation, this armchair was exhibited at the Salon d’Automne in Paris in 1929, as an archetype of the modern conception of furniture, dubbed “domestic equipment” by its creators.\n\nThe separation of metal frame from upholstery expresses the Rationalist approach, this same separation responds to the logic of industrial manufacture, while also evoking the architectural relationship between the load-bearing structure and the walls.\n\nLC4, Chaise Longue à réglage continue, Le Corbusier and Charlotte Perriand, 1928 (year of production 1965)\n\nDesigned in 1928 this chair became famous in 1965 with Cassina, the LC4 is the definitive chaise longue: built in a shape designed for relaxation, the chair was created when the three designers teamed together to put man at the centre of their design, taking the idea that form and function should be at the service of relaxation, creating a perfect balance between its geometric purity and its ergonomic intent.\n\nThe stability of the frame – for any angle of inclination – is guaranteed by the friction through rubber tubes that cover the cross bar of the base. The use of the steel frame to make the body appear like it’s floating (the salute of the body floating in space).\n\nDer Mensch als Industriepalast\n\n> “Man as Industrial Palace”\n\nFritz Kahn (1888–1968) was a German-Jewish gynaecologist and science author who developed a sophisticated graphic analogy between anatomy and machinery. His work was widely distributed in Germany until it was banned under the Nazi regime.\n\nIn a later work from 1943, he describes the relationship between man and machine: “[they] exhibit far-reaching similarities. Both derive their energy from the combustion of carbon, which they obtain from plants. Man, the weaker machine, utilizes fresh plants for fuel, while the locomotive, a stronger machine, uses fossilized plants in the form of coal.”\n\nParadigm of machine — the individuals are changing according this new industrial society. Sort of a small manifesto of the time.\n\nGerman visual communication and animation student Henning Lederer decided to resurrect this complex and unusual way of explaining the body in 2006, growing on the original work and translating it into motion graphics as seen above.\n\nVers une architecture\n\n> “Towards a New Architecture“\n\nFor the link to the translated book (online read) click here.\n\nVers une architecture, recently translated into English as Toward an Architecture but commonly known as Towards a New Architecture after the 1927 translation by Frederick Etchells, is a collection of essays written by Le Corbusier, advocating for and exploring the concept of modern architecture. The book has had a lasting effect on the architectural profession, serving as the manifesto for a generation of architects, a subject of hatred for others, and unquestionably an important work of architectural theory.\n\nThe architectural historian Reyner Banham wrote that its influence was “beyond that of any other architectural work published in this [20th] century to date”, and that unparalleled influence has continued, unabated, into the 21st century.\n\nThe polemical book contains seven essays, all but one of which were published in the magazine L’Esprit Nouveau beginning in 1921. Each essay dismisses the contemporary trends of eclecticism and art deco, replacing them with architecture that was meant to be more than a stylistic experiment; rather, an architecture that would fundamentally change how humans interacted with buildings.\n\nLamarck’s theories and Le Corbusier\n\n“[…] Arms and legs are a consequence of a function that have to perform in the same way as a machine, the bodies have adapted to the function […]”\n\nJean-Baptiste de Monet Lamarck\n\nLe Corbusier looked at Lamarck’s work and he claims (amongst many others):\n\n“[…] A little biology as a preamble: this skeleton to carry, a muscular connective to act, these bowels to feed and to make it work. And some of the structure of the car: a chassis, a bodywork, an engine with its fuel and exhaust organs. […] How can we start from these new freedoms? […] “\n\nLe Corbusier\n\nAnalysing of how the body performs (comparing it to the city/urban environment) we learn from biology and interpret it to machines and the urban environment.\n\nFiat Lingotto Factory\n\nConstruction started in 1916 and the building opened in 1923. The design (by young architect Matté Trucco who you can read a little bit about here) was unusual in that it had five floors, with raw materials going in at the ground floor, and cars built on a line that went up through the building. Finished cars emerged at rooftop level to go onto the test track. The construction was carried out by the company of G A Porcheddu. It was the largest car factory in the world at that time. For its time, the Lingotto building was avant-garde, influential and impressive. Le Corbusier called it “one of the most impressive sights in industry”, and “a guideline for town planning”.\n\nThe building is made out of reinforced concrete, has two parallel, five floors high with 500 meters long construction connected by two twisted ramps on each end. The ramps were built to get to the 1 km long test track on the roof of the building, used to test the cars being released. The test lane resembled a Formula 1 circle track. At the time the building was pushing the car culture and now stands as an architectural icon.\n\nIn over 60 years the Lingotto factory gave life to over 80 different automobile models, the most famous of which were the Torpedo, the Balilla and the legendary Topolino (the first real version of Fiat 500). This last model was built from 1936 until 1957 when the version of the new Fiat 500 was presented.\n\nAfter that, a number of different models followed. All of them with the aim to offer post-war Italian society a flexible and economic solution responding to the needs of Italy’s “economic boom”.\n\nDom-Ino House by Le Corbusier\n\nRead more in-depth about it here (Extract from Le Corbusier et Pierre Jeanneret, Oeuvre complète, volume1, 1910-1929).\n\nIt was a prototype as the physical platform for the mass production of housing. The name is a pun that combines an allusion to domus (Latin for house) and the pieces of the game of dominoes, because the floor plan resembled the game and because the units could be aligned in a series like dominoes, to make row houses of different patterns.\n\nThis design became the foundation for most of his architecture for the next ten years and is strongly related to the five point manifesto (an answer to the post war reconstruction).\n\nFive points of architecture\n\nby Le Corbusier\n\nIn 1927 Le Corbusier published a series of architectural principles in his magazine L’Esprit Nouveau and in the essay collection Vers une architecture, which he used as the basis for his designs. The most famous example of the application of the “Five Points of a New Architecture” is the villa Savoye in Poissy, France.\n\nVille Savoye and Le Corbusier’s theories\n\nCompleted in 1929, Ville Savoye is a modern take on a French country house that celebrates and reacts to the new machine age.\n\nPierre and Eugénie Savoye approached Le Corbusier about building a country home in Poissy in the spring of 1928. Other than an initial brief prepared by Emile for a summer house, space for cars, an extra bedroom and a caretaker’s lodge, Le Corbusier had such freedom in executing the commission that he was limited only by his own architectural aesthetic.\n\nThe house single handedly transformed Le Corbusier’s career as well as the principles of the International Style; becoming one of the most important architectural precedents in the history. Villa Savoye’s detachment from its physical context lends its design to be contextually integrated into the mechanistic/industrial context of the early 20th century, conceptually defining the house as a mechanized entity.\n\nThis statement is not simply translated into the design of a human scaled assembly line; rather the design begins to take on innovative qualities and advances found in other fields of industry, in the name of efficiency.\n\nIn response to his aspirations and admiration of mechanized design, Le Corbusier established “The Five Points” of architecture, which is simply a list of prescribed elements to be incorporated in design. The Five Points of architecture can be thought of as Le Corbusier’s modern interpretation of Vitruvius’ Ten Books on Architecture, not literally in the sense of an instructional manual for architects, but rather a checklist of necessary components of design. So much so that Villa Savoye is thoroughly tailored to Corbusier’s Five Points.\n\nMore about Le Corbusier’s 5 points in Ville Savoy here.\n\nBig issues with hygiene, this was very important to Le Corbusier; so before you move around the space/house there is the hand-washer (the washer becomes like a sculpture because of the way it is positioned).\n\nThere is a sense of a cult of the human body, as shown here with the Ville Savoy bathing area; there are no separated elements, it’s like a sculptured space.\n\nWhen you look at photos of the bathroom in Le Corbusier’s Villa Savoye, you have to also think about life in France at the time it was designed and built. According to Steven Zdatny, writing about The French Hygiene Offensive of the 1950s, personal cleanliness was not exactly a priority at the time. In fact, it was frowned upon.\n\nThere are many lessons about health and hygiene to be learned from the great French architect. With this thought in mind Le Corbusier created new and radical spaces.\n\nThe ramp continues to take you from the inside bottom to the outside top of the house (last few images are of the spiral staircase).\n\nIt is interesting to look at how the environment is framed thanks to the nature of the house. There is presence of plants wrapping from the ground to the top which contributes to the incorporation of the house to the nature that arounds it.\n\nFor more about the Ville Savoy story here,\n\nand for more pictures of the interior click here.\n\nPavillon de L’Esprit Nouveau, Le Corbusier, 1925\n\nOriginally designed for the Paris Art Deco Exhibition in 1925, the prototype of the ‹Pavilion de L’Esprit Nouveau› was rebuilt in 1977 in Bologna. The pavilion was designed to demonstrate the potential for standardising homes with industrially manufactured materials, but was rejected by the organizers and hidden under a screen. Only the Minister of Fine Arts was able to persuade the organizers to let it go before the opening. The pavilion is a prime example of standardised housing units and typical of Le Corbusier emphasises the function and thus revolutionised the modern interior. An avant-garde vision of the future in times of increasing urbanisation.\n\nLe Corbusier divided furnishing into two categories:\n\n1. ‘Artificial limbs’ that can be freely distributed around the house: chairs, tables, rugs, etc.\n\n2.Furnishing that doesn’t necessarily have a direct impact with the human body (with that said they became implemented in the walls): shelves, pictures…\n\nThe two furnishing families are clearly expressed in the houses of W"
