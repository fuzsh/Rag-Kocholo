        "text": "Anyone who is interested in what kind of films were seen in Yugoslavia, a country that no longer exists, could start that research by watching the films in which Milena Dravić played.\n\nHe would need a lot of time for that task - Milena Dravić has more than 100 film roles.\n\nIt was loved by the Yugoslavs, but also by audiences around the world.\n\nHer colleagues still speak of her with great respect.\n\nShe died on October 14, 2018, a year and a half after the death of her husband, the great Serbian and Yugoslav actor Dragan Nikolić.\n\nBattle on the Neretva: 50 years since the film that brought Hollywood to SFRY\n\nDušan Makavejev: The departure of the black wave pioneer\n\nBekim Fehmiu in no man's land\n\n\"When they gave her Dobrica's ring, I cried from joy,\" actress Nada Šargin told the BBC in Serbian.\n\nIt seems to her that hardly anyone can boast of such a career.\n\n\"Classy, ​​sublime, young and older colleagues speak of her as a goddess, Rade Šerbedžija sings Arsenova to her Milena, Vasil Hadžimanov also plays for her, Rade reads another song dedicated to her, there is a short film made up of her brilliant films, interviews, a reportage from the Cannes Festival when she won an award, I watch and think: what a career...\".\n\nI had the privilege of working with Milena when I was just starting out.\n\nAs a student I invited her to act in my third year exam film and - she agreed!\n\nThe biggest film star from this area came to the shoot ready, with creative ideas so that we could improve the whole thing and with great confidence in me as a director.\n\nThe entire student team had the feeling that they had entered through the big doors of our cinematography. Because what is a domestic film without Milena Dravič?\n\nWe made two more films together. Milena was a wonderful, sensitive, generous person and a great professional.\n\nStefan Arsenijeić, director\n\nThe bright beginning and golden age of Yugoslav cinema\n\nShe was born in Belgrade, on Dorćol Street in 1940, went to ballet school and dreamed of becoming a ballerina.\n\nThe first movie The door remains open She recorded František Čapa, a story that follows the experiences of young people in post-war Yugoslavia, while she was in high school.\n\nToo many Branka Bauera opened the door wide for her to the world of acting in 1962, and for the role of Ranka she was awarded the Golden Arena and thus became the youngest winner of this award.\n\nShe gained popularity in the big partisan spectacles directed by Veljko Bulajić - she was Milja u Goats (1962), Nada typhusark u Battles on the Neretva (1969) and Vera u Sadness (1973)\n\nAlso, she played in some of the most important films of the black wave, which had a great reception at world festivals and influenced generations of younger filmmakers.\n\nWith Puriš Đorđević, to whom she was briefly married, she recorded, among other things, A girl (1965) and Tomorrow (1967), which was screened at the Venice Film Festival.\n\nEven at that moment, the current bans on films did not bypass her.\n\nA film by Bahrudin Bata Čengić The role of my family in the world revolution based on the novel of the same name by Bora Ćosić, after its premiere at the Pula Film Festival in 1971, it ended up \"in the bunker\".\n\nCensors at the time were shocked by the scene in which Milena Dravić brings out a cake with Stalin's head, and the actors, after finishing their hair made of whipped cream, begin to eat the Russian communist leader's brain.\n\nA similar fate befell WR Mysteries of the organism by Dušan Makavejev, a film with an experimental structure that deals with the relationship between communist ideology and sexuality, as well as the theories of the Austrian psychoanalyst Wilhelm Reich.\n\nGoran Paskaljević - departure of a member of the \"Golden Prague Five\"\n\nFilm about missing babies: Are \"Seams\" just a Serbian story\n\nHollywood dreams come true in the East\n\nAlthough it delighted critics at the Cannes Film Festival, the film was only shown in cinemas in Yugoslavia in the XNUMXs.\n\nMilena Dravić plays a young communist and hairdresser, who rejects the wooing of a worker, because she is in love with figure skating champion Vladimir Iljic.\n\nAlthough he claims that Milena has achieved an \"incredible range of different, fantastic roles\", for director Stefan Arsenijević, the role of Makavejev is \"a brave, crazy, fascinating, layered role\".\n\n\"In one word - unforgettable.\"\n\nGoran Radovanović made a documentary about the deliberations of the commission that decided whether the film would be screened in front of the public The case of Maccabees which was shown in 2019.\n\nThe Yugoslav press of that time wrote about the praise Milena received for this film from Jack Nicholson and ballet dancer Rudolf Nureyev, whom she adored.\n\nThe incident when, in response to the question: \"Do Yugoslav women know what contraception is?\", threw a box of anti-migraine tablets into the lap of an American journalist at a press conference, has been recounted for a long time.\n\nMilena played a large number of different roles, many of which are important for the history of cinema.\n\nBut since you didn't ask me which role I think is the best or the most significant, but the favorite, and that category is characterized by emotional and extremely subjective determinants, I will give myself the freedom not to choose one of the films that might be expected.\n\nOne of my favorite roles of hers is in the film It's Not Easy With Men for one simple reason - it was the first domestic film I saw in the cinema, which was an experience in itself, because I had six year.\n\nOf course, later I watched many more important roles played by Milena, but this film has a special significance in my film experience, because when you are a child, going to the cinema is a real magic and no objectivity, which comes with age, can diminish that.\n\nMaja Medić, photographer and co-author of the \"Milena\" exhibition on the occasion of the Dobričin ring award\n\n\"Beautiful Milena Dravič. beautiful\"\n\nShe was charming Alfred Hitchcock and Miloš Forman, and for newer generations it will mean that she played in the first film in which Brad Pitt had a leading role The dark side of the sun Božidar Nikolić from 1988.\n\nNevertheless, her colleagues - both contemporaries and younger ones - remember her as a modest and reserved person.\n\n\"Beautiful Milena Dravič. Beautiful. I met her several times and she was always fun and something radiated from her, that something that truly stars have,\" Nada Šargin remembers meeting her.\n\nShe increased her huge popularity in the seventies by participating in a television show Cheek to cheek Zdravka Šotra.\n\nIn this way, the famous movie couple, Milena Dravić and Dragan Nikolić, became a part of every Yugoslav household.\n\nThe theater audience remembers the roles in Miracle in Šargan, Decameron 81 (directed by the famous Italian director Roberto Ćuli), Kir Janji i Urban tragedy. The role of theater manager Katarina in the play Larry Thompson - the tragedy of a youth She played Dušan Kovačević more than 300 times on the stage of the Zvezdara Theater.\n\nShe also worked for children: a series of lullabies Good night, kids based on Duško Radović's text, she filmed it in 1963, and her role as a teacher in Stories from Untold and neighbors in Broom without handle.\n\nOne of her last roles was in the children's film Agi i Ema directed by Milutin Petrović.\n\n\"Balkan Hollywood\": Film service Serbia\n\nNine Sean Connery movies you must see at least ten times\n\nWho was Olivia de Havilland, the last star of the Golden Age of Hollywood?\n\nI was once a guest in her house by the sea, I was taken by Jelena Đokić, I was numb because I'm standing in front of greatness, and Milena hosts us, entertains us and does not ask for confirmation te of its size.\n\nWhen she was awarded Dobriča's ring, the journalists asked to take her picture and she stood up sshe holds out her hand with a ring and poses in an appreciative and elegant manner, enjoying myself but also playing withe.\n\nAt the celebration in ZVezdara Teatrin that day there was a real, beautiful, but forgotten Belgrade, at least for a while.\n\nI love all her roles from Sutjeska, Battle of Neretyou do It's not easy with men and neighbors who rustle and make schennokles from the children's series Broom without a handle.\n\nThat perhaps fascinates me the most, how she knew how to play and have fun with roles - and ourselves and us.\n\nMaybe Milena was lucky to work at the time of great Yugoslav cinematography, but she deserved it and it belongs to her because she knew how to use it and lead a brilliant career, and above all to be a lady.\n\nNada Shargin, actress\n\nThe beginning of the war, in which her homeland disappeared, she met in New York, where she performed a play Milena in the world of men according to the text of Duško Radović.\n\nShe did not work much in the nineties, and she believes that she experienced some kind of ban on state television due to her support for the student protest in 1996/97, so her old films were not shown to a wider audience for a long time.\n\nLater on democratic changes in Serbia in 2000, young directors brought her back to the film.\n\nIn Stefan Arsenijević's debut film Love and other crimes (2007) plays the protagonist's mother.\n\n\"Always nervous about the project, ready to give the maximum, with great talent and experience,\" Arsenijević describes the experience of working with a big star.\n\n\"But what always surprised me was that she always questioned herself. She never relied on old glory. She accepted every role as if it was the most important in her life. That's why she was the best.\"\n\nThis is evidenced by the many awards she received during her career: seven Golden Arenas in Pula, an award for the best female role in the film Special treatment in Cannes 1980, Dobriča's ring and Pavla Vujisić's Lifetime Achievement Award are just some of them.\n\nShe was buried in the Alley of the Giants next to her husband Dragan Nikolić.\n\nFollow us on Facebook i Twitter.
