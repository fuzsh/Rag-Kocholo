        "text": "The name Milena Dravić alone is probably enough to know what kind of diva we are talking about. She acted in over a hundred films, and her collaboration with Ljubiša Samardžić brought her popularity.\n\nSome know her from the films Kozara, Sekula is getting married again, Zona Zamfirova or the series Policeman from Rooster Hill, Theater in the House or Crazy, Confused, Normal. Commercials in which she and Dragan Nikolić traditionally starred are also unforgettable.\n\nIn the next episode of Star Magazine, watch an exclusive interview with one of the biggest stars of Yugoslav cinema, Milena Dravić.\n\nIn this first televised interview after the death of her husband Dragan Nikolić, the theater and film diva recalls the most important moments of her life, shows objects and photos that marked the career of the unforgettable acting couple - Milena and Gaga.\n\nShe talks about Nebojša Glogovac, but also about her relationship with Montenegro, where she first came as a five-year-old girl.\n\nThe interview with the unique and inimitable Milena was conducted by Aleksandar Đuričić, correspondent of Star Magazine from Belgrade.\n\nWatch the interview tonight on the Star magazine show from 21 pm on TV Vijesti."
