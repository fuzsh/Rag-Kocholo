RADMILO and MIRKO are young and successful gay couple, and they would be a happy couple anywhere else except in - Serbia. They try to live discreetly but still, every day they are abused by the homophobic majority. Mirko is a gay rights activist, and his dream is to organize the first successful PRIDE event in Belgrade. This is almost a \"mission impossible\"; in 2001, an attempt to hold PRIDE in Belgrade ended up in bloodshed. One decade later, the situation is not much better - nationalist and neo-Nazi organizations prepare another massacre in case of holding the gay parade, while the police refuse to provide protection for the participants. A strange couple arrives in Radmilo's and Mirko's life - LEMON an ex criminal and war veteran, the owner of a small security company and his fiance - PEARL (30) a beauty parlor owner. Radmilo, a successful veterinarian, performs a life-saving operation Lemon's pit-bull terrier, the victim of a drive-by shooting that served as a warning to the dog's master. Mirko runs an agency that organizes sophisticated weddings and now he has the ultimate nightmare clients - Pearl and Lemon. The encounter between these two worlds ends in disaster - yet another humiliation for Radmilo and Mirko. Mirko had enough - not long ago he received Immigrant Visa from Canada and wants to leave the country forever. Radmilo is ready for a desperate measures to keep his partner and their relationship - He offers a deal to Lemon, asking that Lemon's agency provide protection for the Belgrade Pride. In return, Mirko will organize the wedding party for Pearl and Lemon. Lemon reluctantly accepts, but his staff refuses to protect homosexuals. Put in a tight spot, Lemon thinks of his \"dear\" enemies from the ex-Yu wars. LEMON and RADMILO embark on a recruiting trip all over ex-Yugoslavia. They manage to sign up for their mission: NIKO (45) a Croat war veteran, HALIL (40), a Bosnian Muslim, and AZEM (45), an Albanian from Kosovo. But the handful of \"samurai\" are yet to face their greatest challenge...

In a Serbian village on the banks of the Sava River (which constitutes the border of the Austro-Hungarian Empire), the local population falls into two factions with radically different ideologies: the veterans from prior Balkan conflicts, many of whom are invalids given their war casualties, and the new military recruits - young, strapping and full of vigor. When the Great War formally erupts following the Archduke's assassination, the new recruits of the village march off to the front lines, leaving the invalids behind; many of those who remain willfully and irresponsibly take sexual advantage of the soldiers' wives and sisters. News of this reaches the Serbian High Command shortly before the battles commence; in response, he summons the invalids and places them at the front lines, in an attempt to effectively deal with the guilty parties. Meanwhile, an unexpected romance blossoms between an area policeman, his wife, and a Balkan war invalid.\n\nFestivals and Awards / Cinema city, Novi Sad - Best director / Cinema city, Novi Sad - Best Lead Actor (Lazar Ristovski) / Cinema city, Novi Sad - Best editor (Petar MarkoviÄ) / Montreal World Film Festival - Best Artistic Contribution / Filmski susreti, NiÅ¡ - Grand Prix for Best Actor (Lazar Ristovski) / Filmski susreti, NiÅ¡ - Award for Actors excellence (Milutin MiloÅ¡eviÄ) / Filmski susreti, NiÅ¡ - Award for Best Debut (Milena PrediÄ) / Filmski susreti, NiÅ¡ - Special Jury Mention (NataÅ¡a JanjiÄ) / Fipresci Serbia - Best photography (DuÅ¡an JoksimoviÄ) / Fipresci Serbia - Best production design (Miljen Kreka KljakoviÄ)\n\n1999 (THE REJECTS)\n\nLanguage / Serbian\n\nGenre / drama, dark comedy, musical\n\nWritten by / Srdjan DragojeviÄ, Dimitrije Vojnov\n\nDirected by / Srdjan DragojeviÄ\n\nProduced by / Biljana PrvanoviÄ, Srdjan DragojeviÄ\n\nCountry of production / Serbia\n\nSynopsis / The last part of the trilogy \"90`s\" after the films \"Pretty village, pretty flame\" and \"The Wounds\". The plot of the film takes place in Belgrade, where we follow the main characters during a night in May 1999, while NATO planes and \"smart bombs\" are bombing Serbia. \"Rejects\" is, almost certainly, MUSICAL - a genre that does not exist in serbian cinema. Considering ourselves \"deadly\" seriously, we have often neglected this genre. But, it seems that there is nothing more healing than the same. And in cinema, but also in life. The screenplay \"REJECTS\" won the first prize and financial support at the Festival in Thessaloniki, at the co-production market - The president of the jury who decided on the best project was Guillermo Arriaga, the writer of the films \"Amores Perros\" and \"Babel\".\n\nScreenplay is available for your consideration upon request at\n\nsrdjan@deliriumfilms.rs / biljana@deliriumfilms.rs\n\nPASHA\n\nGenre / drama, comedy, historical, western\n\nWritten by / Srdjan DragojeviÄ (Inspired by the book \"MEMOARS FROM THE BALKANS 1858-1878\" by Martin GjurgjeviÄ, published in Mostar in 1910)\n\nDirected by / Srdjan DragojeviÄ\n\nProduced by / Biljana PrvanoviÄ\n\nCountries of production / Serbia, Montenegro\n\nSynopsis / (A Balkan Western comedy based on historical characters and events with a great deal of fantasy)\n\nIn the late 1860s, Turkish nobleman OSMAN PASHA and the future Prince of Montenegro NIKOLA are the cadets of the famous French military academy Saint-Cyr. Despite the centuries-old war between their countries, Osman and Nikola become best friends. Along with the studies of military art and science, in their spare time the two of them try to master another noble art - POKER. Ten years later, Nikola is the Prince of Montenegro and Osman Pasha leads the attack of the Turkish army on the small principality. The Montenegrin win the battle and capture Osman Pasha. Despite the resentment of his Dukes, Nikola spares Pasha's life and takes him as a prisoner of war to Cetinje, the capital of Montenegro. As he waits for the Sultan to decide whether he will pay the ransom for his head or not, Pasha is the guest of the only hotel in Cetinje, along with a number of other European representatives who came to watch the battle. Pasha kills time at the poker table, at first with the European diplomats, then with the Montenegrins. The game of poker turns into Pasha's winning streak. The small country of Montenegro starts to lose its centuries-long independence...\n\nScreenplay is available for your consideration upon request at\n\nsrdjan@deliriumfilms.rs / biljana@deliriumfilms.rs"
