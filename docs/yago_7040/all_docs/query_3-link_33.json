        "text": "The City of Belgrade will open a contest for the reconstruction of eight squares by the end of next week, Deputy Mayor Goran Vesic announced on RTS.\n\n– One of them is the square on the corner of Cara Nikolaja and Milesevska streets, where we will also open a contest for a “Cheek to Cheek” sculpture in honor of Milena Dravic and Dragan Nikolic – Vesic said, as reported by Beoinfo.\n\nHe pointed out that the square on the corner of Tadeusa Koscuska and Strahinjica Bana streets, as well as other squares in attractive locations in Belgrade, would be developed as well.\n\n– There will also be squares on the corners of Njegoseva and Maksima Gorkog streets at the Kalenic Green Market and Balkanska and Gavrila Principa streets, in Milovana Milovanovica Street near Hotel Astorija, in Kraljevica Marka Street, which will be turned into a pedestrian zone, at the Palilula Green Market with the surrounding streets and on the corner of Bircaninova Street and Oslobodjenja Blvd. The tendering procedure pertains to design and construction, and all the works should be completed by next spring, when we will get eight new squares. So far, we have developed the section of Strahinjica Bana Street between Francuska and Skadarska streets – Vesic said."
