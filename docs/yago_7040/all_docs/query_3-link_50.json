Next to the coffin were colleagues and friends and among the closest ones were Vojin Ćetković, Nebojša Glogovac, Žarko Laušević and Svetozar Cvetković.\n\nA commemoration was held earlier at the Atelier 212. It was attended by his wife Milena Dravić. Dragan Bjelogrić, Seka Sablić, Rade Šerbedžija, Ivan Jeftović, Ivan Bakjarev and others.\n\nAs a reminder, one of the greatest and most beloved actors in the region passed away on March 11 at the age of 73. He played more than a hundred roles without which the film and theatre scene of the former Yugoslavia cannot be imagined.\n\n(Source: klix.ba)"
