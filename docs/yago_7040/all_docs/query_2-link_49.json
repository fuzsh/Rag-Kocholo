        "text": "Representations of the Roma are ubiquitous in the history of Balkan cin­ema. These films have tended to be by non-Roma directors, with the Ro­ma as the object of representation. Consequently, the critical reception of the films has focused on the issue of verisimilitude. In recent scholarship critics have utilized the psychoanalytic concept of &quot;projective identifica­tion&quot; to account for the persistent interest in Gypsy culture and life. In this paper I draw on an alternative tradition of Lacanian psychoanalysis to argue that Tony Gatlif&#39;s Gadjo dilo, rather than presenting an authen­tic picture of Roma culture, foregrounds the impossibility of representa­tion ever truthfully capturing the object. Deploying the Lacanian con­cepts of das Ding and &quot;The Woman does not exist,&quot; the paper demon­strates how Gatlif problematises the very notion of the Roma as a ho­mogenized culture and identity.\n\nThis paper is an attempt to analyze particular scenes from the TV series “Složna braća” and “Crni Gruja” and the film “Balcancan” for the purpose of surveying the featured stereotypical representations of former-Yugoslav ethnicities, identifying their roles within the said examples of film and TV discourse, and proving that familiarity with the discursive practices of these particular cultures (discourse communities) is essential for interpreting these artistic discourses (texts) in the manner intended by their authors. Ethnic stereotypes are, therefore, discussed as socio-cultural constructs or myths generated by the discursive practices of a particular culture, as, it is discourses that “bring cultural objects into being by naming them, defining them and delimiting their field of operation” (Stam, Burgoyne and Flitterman-Lewis 2005: 216). They are also viewed as part of a larger structure – a discursive universe comprised of interrelated mythical texts (Johansen and Larsen 2002: 55–56) shaped by former-Yugoslav discourse communities. For this reason, the mentioned texts will be analyzed as sharing the said discursive universe.\n\nThe rhetoric of discourses in and around current films on Roma-Hungarian interethnic relations prevents audiences from positively engaging with Roma characters. My analysis reveals the ways in which the two documentaries broadcast on national Hungarian television on Roma people since 2009 block the channels of identification between viewers and filmic characters. Additionally, this essay examines the rhetoric of the press release issued by the Hungarian Ministry of Public Administration and Justice on the film Just the Wind at the Berlin Film Festival. In the press release the Ministry actively seeks to widen the gap between the racially motivated killing series in 2008 and 2009 against Roma and the filmic representation of the same events, which in fact enables audiences to identify with the victims. I argue that the seemingly different discourses overlap in their efforts to distance the viewer from Roma, thereby contributing to the strengthening of majority society’s prejudices against them.\n\nPrompted by comments and criticisms of a paper dealing with Emir Kusturica’s Zivot je cudo made by an anonymous reviewer I hope to address three issues: 1) the expansion of the canon studied, 2) the ideological slant of the study, and 3) the question of weight given to extra-textual evidence. First, the reviewer points out that studying Kusturica’s movies, especially Underground, brings nothing new to the table because it rehashes old formulas touching either on ethnic propaganda (Cerovic 1995, Finkielkraut 1995a, 1995b) or on Balkan stereotypes (Iordanova 2001, Zizek 1997a, 1997b, Levi 2007). New movies and director’s should be sought out in order to apply Todorova’s (1997) theoretical framework. I argue that it is illegitimate to expand the canon to works the circulation of which is limited and that is why Kusturica remains our best bet. Nevertheless, I demonstrate that the focus should be switched from Underground to Zivot je cudo. Secondly, I tackle the reviewer’s skepticism of “insider” analysis because it necessarily has an ideological/nationalistic slant (the reviewer points out all ex-Yugoslav commentators have something to gain or lose by the virtue of their nationalities). I point out that the study of Balkanism is itself a political project and thus has an ideological slant, and that the commentators, regardless of their nationality stand to gain or lose something. Thus, we should focus on the comments made not the commentators. Finally, I conclude with an appeal to giving intra-textual evidence or rebuttals of Balkanism greater emphasis than extra-textual ones, especially because in Kusturica’s case it reveals that the often overlooked aesthetic break that takes place with Dom za vesanje goes hand in hand with the representation of Balkan sterotypes. Whether this is subversion or proliferation of Balkanism remains to be settled.\n\nWhile gypsy imaginaries have played a key role in the representation of a certain idea of national identity throughout the history of Spanish cinema, the social subjects, i.e., the Rroma, have traditionally been relegated to the position of object of the gaze rather than narrators of their own filmic discourses. This research considers contemporary self-representations in cinema based on an epistemology of situated feeling (Periáñez Bolaño, 2016) among the Rroma people and analyses the operations evident in films that contribute to processes of decolonisation of ethno-racial modes of representation. To this end, this article approaches the work of the Spanish filmmaker Pilar Távora from a decolonial perspective and contextualises it in what is described here as Cinema of Romani Reexsistentia. The methods used to achieve these objectives include a review of the literature and of the director’s filmography, an in-depth interview with the filmmaker herself and an analysis of her latest film, Helios Gómez, tinta y munición (2019)."
