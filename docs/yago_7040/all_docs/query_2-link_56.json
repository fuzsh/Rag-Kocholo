        "text": "Westernisation of Yugoslav society\n\nAfter 1948 and the turn of Yugoslavia towards the countries of Western Europe, there were certain changes in society that led to the emergence of the phenomenon of Westernization of Yugoslav culture. In the years that followed, there was a sharp rise in the purchasing power of the population, which is now able to afford more than it could in the war and years after the war. The standard of living was determined by a stronger purchasing and consuming power that enabled the model of living to turn to the Western model. In such a system, which adopted numerous phenomena “from the West”, the image of women also changed, which increasingly deviated from the stereotypical Soviet model and took on the visual identity of the modern woman of capitalist society. The modern woman, as an effect of the consumerist society, spends more and more time in the rituals of beautification and shopping.\n\nThe newly acquired needs of the society also influenced the change of the visual structure of Yugoslav cities. On the territory of the entire country, kiosks, supermarkets and department stores began to “emerge” according to the Western model, where Yugoslavs could buy clothes that resembled those from the West. One of the central points of these social changes was fashion, through which the innovations that Yugoslav society, and especially Yugoslav women, adopted were best seen. In the context of the development of fashion, the economic reform from 1965 is especially important, which opened the way for a different business. The reform contributed to a changed understanding of the market and advertising and caused the expansion of the marketing concept. Marketing also influenced the appearance of a large number of fashion magazines where clothing items were mostly advertised. Fashion magazines have played a huge role in informing women about the latest fashion trends in Europe and the world.\n\nMagazines with an international license, such as Elle, Vogue, Amica, provided information on current trends in the Western European fashion system, but domestic magazines should not be neglected, among which the leading place is occupied by Bazaar. Although domestic department stores were becoming more and more supplied, the need for a larger selection of foreign products influenced the expansion and development of shopping tourism, which was the best way to indulge in the seasonal whims of Western fashion productions.\n\nAn increasing number of Yugoslavs went to nearby European cities, of which Trieste was the most popular, to “supply” clothes for the next season. All these factors, as well as many others, indicate that in the decades after the Second World War, and most of the 1960s, Yugoslavia transformed from a socialist country into a country that, in the context of lifestyle, increasingly leaned towards the Western block.\n\nGreater openness to the West has led to faster acceptance of Western fashion trends and avoidance of the dominant aesthetics of Eastern European fashion systems. In addition to adopting elements “from the West”, Yugoslav fashion was also based on aesthetics taken from national culture. By incorporating motifs from its own history, Yugoslav fashion gained an authentic stylistic identity.\n\nThis is how the fashion in the “national style” was created, whose identity was built by going back to the past, that is, through the memory of the golden periods of this region, primarily the Middle Ages.\n\nHigh fashion in Yugoslavia\n\nThe Yugoslav textile industry had many difficulties, such as the production of inadequate cuts, poor design, the absence of all sizes and an unorganized table for the standard of ready-made sizes. The consequences of that dissatisfaction can be seen on the full shelves with unsold clothes. It has also begun to be publicly commented on the need to improve the domestic textile industry.\n\nWithin fashion and clothing, a special phenomenon of this period is the beginning and development of the socialist version of high fashion in the territory of Yugoslavia. The notion of haute couture in the context of a socialist country is an interesting phenomenon, because haute couture has always been a part of the tradition of bourgeois society that did not fit into the socialist concept of social order. In the work of Danijela Velimirović, the author quotes Đurđa Bartlet, who points out that Yugoslavia accepted fashion for the sake of maintaining the political system.\n\nThe year of creation of the official socialist version of high fashion in Yugoslavia is taken to be 1967, when Aleksandar Joksimović presented his first collection Simonida.\n\nThe socialist version of haute couture created in Yugoslavia represented borrowed elements of Western fashion in the form of cuts and forms, which were intended for the middle class of these countries, and was different from the fashion of other Eastern European countries. The specific international position of Yugoslavia contributed to that.\n\nIn addition to the socialist version of high fashion, the Yugoslav audience had the opportunity to see examples of high fashion by foreign exhibitors, through the Fashion Fairs, which were held regularly in Belgrade. Fashion fairs were major events in Yugoslavia. During these fairs, big names of the French fashion scene often gathered in Belgrade, among which was the fashion house Dior.\n\nFairs were one of the best ways to present foreign fashion live to the local population, and later an excellent platform for the affirmation of Yugoslav designers. Domestic designers were supported by the very top of the state, ie by Jovanka Broz, who often attended these events and thus expressed open support for the domestic fashion industry. In the context of presenting foreign products, product fairs were a great way to promote Western culture throughout the Eastern Bloc and in Yugoslavia.\n\nIt all started with ‘Simonida’\n\nWith the appearance of Aleksandar Joksimović, “the king of scissors”, as he was called, there was a revolutionary change in the then gloomy, uniformed and unaestheticized clothes of the socialist regime. Soaring on the world fashion scene, he was the first in Serbia to introduce a thematic collection as a motif for free inspiration, thus promoting not only his inspiring spirit, but also numerous personalities from Serbian history from whose bones he drew inexhaustible inspiration. Aleksandar Joksimović was one of the most important promoters of fashion in the national style. Inspired by Serbian history and tradition, Byzantium and medieval Serbian painting for the creation of new collections, he experienced world fame, and the domestic press proclaimed him the fashion leader. He is one of the few designers who refused to work for the fashion house Dior.\n\nA radical change in the life of Aleksandar Joksimović followed in 1963, when the Institute for Household Improvement provided the clerk with an engagement in the creation of models from Indian sari fabrics. That is how Joksimović entered fashion for the first time, which will dictate his life direction in the future. Joksimović received praise from fashion critics, the overall impression was that these are models designed with a lot of imagination.\n\nIn the sixties, Joksimović turned more and more to fashion and became the head of the National Salon, but also the position of the editor-in-chief of the Bazaar newspaper in 1965. In that way, through his activities in the magazine, he directed Yugoslavs to the latest Western European fashion trends.\n\nHe attracted the attention of the public when in 1965 he prepared a collection inspired by fabrics, cuts and ornamentation of folk costumes from the area of Kosovo and Metohija. The collection of models, based on the cuts of zubuns (a formal sleeveless dress), vests and anthers, and the ornamentation of a filigree ball and tailored embroidery, aroused the interest of not only the domestic but also the foreign press.\n\nUntil the creation of the extravagant Simonida in 1967, Joksimović designed two more collections for the National Salon. The first collection from 1965 consisted of models made of crocheted and knitted wool, which imitated authentic patterns, while the second collection from 1966 was inspired by various regional folk costumes (Kosovo, Šumadija and Montenegrin) and the city of Prizren costume.\n\nIn 1967, he presented his first official collection of grandiose fashion in the national key. It was the collection of ‘Simonida’, with which, it is believed, the socialist version of high fashion in Yugoslavia began. With his work, Aleksandar Joksimović had an influence on the aestheticization of the Yugoslav fashion industry. As a designer, he enjoyed great respect on the territory of the whole of Yugoslavia, but also outside its borders. His imaginative design aroused the interest of the foreign media because he broke stereotypes about fashion trends in socialist countries. Even his own visual identity was reminiscent of the visual identity of Western fashion designers – Saint Laurent, who was the head of the fashion house Dior in those years). As the most important representative of national design, he initiated the introduction of novelties in the Yugoslav fashion system. These changes often represented ideas adopted from European fashion houses that Joksimović implemented into the Yugoslav system. Kristijan Dior himself used some of the ideas with which Joksimović changed the domestic fashion scene, and which refer to the thematic determination of collections and drawing inspiration from the past.\n\nA year later, the collections Vitraž (Stained Glass) and Pejzaž (Landscape) in 1968 followed, followed by the collection Prokleta Jerina (Cursed Jerina) in 1969. In the following decade, the below collections followed: Vele Nigrinova in 1970, Emina in 1971, Ptice (Birds) in 1972, Visoko 73 (High 73) in 1972, Ana Karenjina (1973), Formula 1 i Ramona (Formula 1 and Ramona) in 1974, Milena Barili in 1975, Mosaic in 1975, Marija Tanase in 1976, Isidora in 1976, Teorema (Theorem) in 1977.\n\nAleksandar Joksimović was a great admirer of the work of the late Kristijan Dior at that time. In several of his interviews, he pointed out him as a significant figure in European fashion, and through his work and thoughts during the design, he showed that certain ideas of the French bodybuilder were close to him. One of the significant novelties that ‘Simonida’ brought to the Yugoslav fashion system with his collection is the thematic determination of the collection. The same thing was done by Christian Dior in 1947, presenting his first collection ‘Corolla’, renamed ‘New Look’ by the media. When Dior presented the Corolla collection, he decided that his central motif would be the shape of a flower. By creating dresses with specific cuts, he tried to shape a woman into a floral form and make her a so-called “flower woman”.\n\nThe idea of ​​a flower woman was founded in the designer’s vision to make the world a utopia where women will be perfect beings who will ennoble with their beauty and make the world a more beautiful space to live. He believed that beauty alone has the energy to change the world, and the main bearer of that beauty was a woman. In order to convey the idea of ​​a flower woman in his design as convincingly as possible, he did botanical research and analyzed the changes in the shape of flowers throughout the life cycle in order to present his idea to the public as accurately as possible.\n\nAleksandar Joksimović also took over this way of preparing the collection. Before the creation, he chose the idea, that is, the leading woman, and then he set out on exhaustive research. The research was in the form of reading books, listening to music, visiting museums, and all for the purpose of the most complete realization of the initial idea. Seasonal renewal brought new quests and explorations of epochs. This is very important because this approach to design has raised Yugoslav fashion to a higher level. Joksimović believed that such an approach ennobles fashion and gives creative work essence and depth in creation.\n\nIn this way, fashion transcends craftsmanship and grows into an artistic discipline that requires serious thought and reflection. High and refined thought makes an essential difference between high fashion and ordinary clothes.\n\nThe past as inspiration\n\nGoing back to the past from which inspiration is drawn is a significant feature of the work of both designers. The concept of a return to the past was in both cases partially encouraged by the current state ideology, but there are also certain facts that point to nostalgic elements in the work of these creators. When he presented his collection to the French and international media on February 12, 1947, in the premises of his studio at 30 Avenue Montaigne, Dior offered the world a completely revolutionary fashion line that basically revived the well-known historical elements of French costume.\n\nChristian Dior’s return to the past can be viewed through two aspects. The first aspect implies his nostalgic personality and attachment to the belle epoch period. Although he was a child in the period of the true belle époque, he experienced the breath of this period through the figure of the mother to whom he was extremely attached, and without whom he was left in the fourth decade of his life. In the chapter on Dior’s work, Ilya Parkins in the book Poiret, Dior and Schiaparelli: Fashion, Femininity and Modernity brings certain nostalgic elements to the relationship and grief for the mother, emphasizing that through design work he constantly tried to revive the mother figure.\n\nDior himself expresses nostalgia in his autobiography Christian Dior et Moi (Christian Dior and I), speaking with a set about the interwar period in France as a kind of continuation of the “beautiful era” from before the war, ie the period when people believed in a better and brighter future. terrible events that ended with the end of the First World War.\n\nSoon the Second World War happened, which had huge consequences for the whole world and the entire society. They were also felt in the context of French fashion. Namely, during the years of occupation of France, which lasted from July 1940 to August 1944, Germany introduced certain innovations into the fashion system of Vichy France. After the arrival of the Nazis in Paris, the French fashion scene, which had been developing since the seventeenth century, moved in a completely different direction – refined, stripped of its ornamentation, lavish elements and everything that the French were used to.\n\nThere was even an idea to move the fashion centers from Paris to Berlin or Vienna, but with the skilful negotiations of Lisien Lelonga, the center was still kept in Paris. Although the center was retained, French fashion lost its recognizable charm in the war years, which was invested in centuries ago. After the liberation of France, an important moment happened for the entire visual culture and artistic creation in France. Namely, in 1944, Charles de Gaulle gave a speech in memory in which he called on all the people of France to renew France and its culture with joint efforts and to revitalize everything that was destroyed during the Nazi occupation. It calls for the revival of those capital French periods in history when the French state was the strongest and most brilliant. That speech was broadcast on national radio stations and there is almost no person in France who has not heard it.\n\nAlthough to this day it has not been clarified to what extent nostalgia in Dior’s work was a product of personal affinities, and to what extent De Gaulle’s speech, it is very likely that both aspects had a certain influence.\n\nJoksimović and Dior:\n\nsimilarities and differences\n\nA comparative analysis of the way of thinking of the two designers indicates certain similarities in the work and thinking about fashion. In the years when Aleksandar Joksimović was creating, Dior had already become a mythical figure in the fashion world, whose ideas about fashion and costume were known outside the borders of France, and it is almost certain that they were not foreign to the Yugoslav designer either. With their work and return to the past, both of them sought to create a national version of high fashion in the desire to create a departure from the previous one – Dior from Nazi fashion, Joksimović from conservative socialist aesthetics.\n\nAlso, when choosing historical epochs, they both chose the brightest historical periods of their countries, including their own affinities. They created by first choosing a “leading woman”, and then engaging in thorough research with the aim of the final realization of their own ideas. During their lives, both were recognized in their countries and recognized as prominent fashion designers. The question arises as to how much the Yugoslav public, primarily journalists, knew the work of Kristijan Dior, ie whether they could, at the time when they called Aleksandar Joksimović the domestic version of Dior, notice the mentioned similarities between the two designers.\n\nAlthough certain similarities can be noticed in the way of thinking, from the formal aspect, the pieces of high fashion by Aleksandar Joksimović were significantly reduced to what was created by Christian Dior. Also, certain discrepancies can be noticed in the presented possibilities of comparison of the two creators. Namely, in the thematic determination of the collection, Dior mostly opted for more abstract forms of expression, such as the woman flower, while Joksimović was more specific and more often found inspiration in women from history. Also, in the context of finding inspiration in the past, Dior turned much more to the historical form of costumes – corsets and crinolines, which he then reinterpreted, while Joksimović was inspired by certain iconographic motifs embroidered on the fabrics of the model.\n\nWhat could be considered the greatest possibility of bringing Kristijan Dior and Aleksandar Joksimović into contact is the fact that the Dior fashion house was one of the first fashion houses to present its models to the Yugoslav public at the 1959 International Fashion Fair. At that time, the Yugoslav media had the opportunity to see high fashion pieces in Yugoslavia for the first time.\n\nThe models of the fashion house Dior have become synonymous with sophisticated high fashion, which the media recognized in the collections of the socialist version of high fashion by Aleksandar Joksimović. This influenced the media connection between the two designers. Also, we must not omit any of Joksimović’s visits to Paris when the leaders of the fashion house Dior hosted him, took him through all the rooms of the studio on Avenue Montaigne 30 and offered him the position of chief designer of the house, which he refused in order to continue developing what started in the field of fashion in Yugoslavia.\n\nUnfortunately, Aleksandar Joksimović – Yugoslav Dior failed to make a global brand out of himself. In the early seventies, he stopped creating unique models of high fashion, believing that in the environment in which he creates, there are no conditions for that. His name continued to be associated with the Yugoslav fashion industry, but not haute couture. Crisis years soon followed in Yugoslavia, which influenced the Yugoslav fashion industry to become marginalized. Insufficient interest in fashion trends in Yugoslavia influenced the name of Aleksandar Joksimović and his crucial importance for the development of Yugoslav fashion to remain insufficiently noticed in circles outside the science of fashion and art. And besides the fact that he retired from fashion and the public life a long time ago he said in a recent interview, which he didn’t give often even when he was in the spotlight and as he is retired now he is reluctant to give interviews and constantly emphasises that he is no longer important and that everything has already been said, that he is enjoying his retirement days and is focusing on things that he couldn’t before because he didn’t have time.\n\nCollaborating with Jovanka Broz\n\nThe First Lady of the SFRY wore the clothes of foreign textile producers, but she also preferred the domestic textile industry. Aleksandar is also known for designing costumes and dresses for Jovanka Broz. As part of the production of Centrotekstil, every year for Jovanka Broz during the spring / summer and autumn / winter seasons, models tailored to her were realized. Having exhibited in many capitals, he was recognised in the world (he refused the job of a designer in Dior) and in our country he was the logical choice of the first lady of SFRY. In this way, Jovanka promoted the domestic textile industry. She also showed her affection for the fashion scene of the former Yugoslavia by attending the “Fashion in the World” event. Back in 1969, Joksimović had the honor of showing her his collection “Stained Glass”. She wore his models to everyday occasions, manifestations, receptions, international visits and welcoming foreign officials. Alexander’s model from the collection Birds (1972) made in the patchwork technique that she wore during the visit of Queen Elizabeth II.\n\n“It was then that Jovanka Broz, Madame Lazareff, the owner of Elle magazine, the director of Christian Dior, a famous Parisian chansonnier, who sang between the two shows, came for the first time, all in all a serious team. Then Jovanka saw me, but nothing happened. The following year, we went with Stained Glass to Leningrad, at the worst possible time for us, when there was a revolution in the Czech Republic. It was the first plane to fly, and we were there like in prison. We survived Leningrad and then we exhibited part of the collection here at the Fashion Fair, at the Centrotekstil stand. Jovanka also came. We dressed all the models in one and the same model, they stood to the side, I welcomed Jovanka. We talked a bit and they pushed me out right away. She asked where I was and they rushed to find me. She went in search herself, I was with the models, I remember how she looked at each model individually. From there there is a whole series of our photos. She asked me to sit next to her, that’s how our friendship started. But, honestly, I didn’t create anything special for her, it was more of a consultation. I mostly did her wardrobe for home use. The first time I went to her salon in Užička, there was a large shelf with models and she asked me to inspect the wardrobe together because she was supposed to travel. For each trip, she received an official protocol, where and what, at what time we are allowed to wear, down to the smallest details, the color she should wear. She had only one mistake, when they were in Japan, she was not allowed to wear a purple dress because it was exclusively an imperial privilege. She told me that it would not happen to her again in her life, that she would read the protocol twice since then. She was perfectly built, she had beautiful shoulders and torso, and even when she gained weight, that grateful silhouette remained, completely harmonious. […] Mostly Nada, her sister, came to me, and then we went to Jovanka’s. She sends a car, usually after dinner, so we can stay longer. The tailors never went, if something needed to be altered or narrowed down, Nada and I did it. […] I worked for the whole set of women executives and they were all demanding, unpleasant, even rude, you don’t need to hear the rest of it … Of course, they never paid. Jovanka was the opposite, a true lady.”\n\nAleksandar Joksiović said for XXZ Magazine\n\nHe once told her that he had never been a member of any political party, to which she replied: “You haven’t missed anything.” Quite often they laughed at that dialogue."
