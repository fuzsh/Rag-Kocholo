        "text": "The establishment of the Alumni Foundation of the University of Belgrade was preceded by the establishment of the Alumni Organization of the University of Belgrade, the Founding Assembly of which was held on September 12, 2008, at the Sava Center, as part of the celebration of 200 years of the University of Belgrade and 200 years of higher education in Serbia. In 2022, representatives of several alumni organizations of individual faculties of the University of Belgrade launched an Initiative to revitalize the Alumni Organization of the University of Belgrade. The Initiative first met in September 2022, at the suggestion of the Alumni of the Faculty of Philology, which also hosted the first meeting. The joint work of the University and the Initiative has resulted in the establishment of the University of Belgrade Alumni Foundation, with the University being its sole founder. The Council of the University of Belgrade made the Decision on the establishment of the AFUB (02-09 Number: 06-2286/8-23) at its meeting on November 9, 2023, appointed members of the Board of Directors and the President of the Board of Directors (02-09 Number: 06-2286/1023). Prof. Dr. Goran Petković, President of the Alumni Association of the Faculty of Economics, was appointed as the President of the Board of Directors. The Council gave a positive opinion on the proposal to appoint Branko Vuksan from the Alumni Association of the Faculty of Philology as the director of AFUB (02-09 Number: 06-2286/9-23). Branko Vuksan was elected as the director at the meeting of the Board of Directors on November 16, 2023.\n\nIt is a great honor for me, as the first director of the Alumni Foundation of the University of Belgrade, to contribute to connecting the alumni of our University in the country, and especially in the diaspora. I am aware of the fact that the tradition of alumni organizations at major world universities obliges our Alumni and University to join this large and important community. We will particularly insist on creating bridges between alumni who have achieved great career success after studying at our University and young graduates who are at the beginning of their professional path. In this way, as alumni, we return the value that the University provided us during our studies and contribute to its development.\n\nBranko Vuksan, director of the Alumni Foundation of the University of Belgrade"
