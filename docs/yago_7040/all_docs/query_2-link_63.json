        "text": "Luka Ćelović – Trebinjac\n\nLuka Ćelović – Trebinjac (Pridvorci near Trebinje, October 18, 1854 – Belgrade, August 15, 1929) was a famous merchant, financier, benefactor and endower, one of the richest people in Serbia at the beginning of the 20th century and a great benefactor of Belgrade University.\n\nHe completed his elementary studies in Trebinje, apprenticed in trade in Banja Luka and Brčko, and from 1872, he was apprenticed to Petar Radosavljević and Mita Ignjatović in Belgrade. As a volunteer, in the summer of 1875 he joined the insurgents in Herzegovina, and from 1876 he joined the Serbian army during both Serbian-Turkish wars. In the fall of 1878, he began to engage in trade on his own. As early as 1882, as a reputable merchant, he participated in the founding of the Belgrade Cooperative, which was intended for small and medium-sized merchants, artisans, and officials, and devoted himself completely to the activities of the Cooperative.\n\nHe was elected as a member of the Steering Committee of the National Bank of Serbia in February 1912 and in the same year by the Decree of His Highness King Petar I from February 7, Luka Ćelović was appointed a member of the Endowment Council at the Ministry of Education, a member of which he remained until his death.\n\nDuring the First World War, as a member of the Steering Committee of the National Bank, he participated in the evacuation of the National Bank's treasury with Đorđe Vajfert and Marko Stojanović, first to Thessaloniki and then to Marseilles, where he remained until the end of the war, helping our wounded and refugees.\n\nLuka Ćelović significantly contributed to the change of Belgrade's visual identity, first by building a family house in Savamala at Kraljevića Marka St. 1, which was built in 1903 by Eng. Miloš Savčić, and then by participating in the construction of the Palace of the Belgrade Cooperative and the magnificent building of the \"Bristol\" hotel, as well as the Stock Exchange building. On his estate, in today's Karađorđeva Street, he built and arranged a large and beautiful park, which he visited every morning. He bequeathed all his property to the University of Belgrade. He founded the \"Endowment of Luka Ćelović – Trebinjac, a Belgrade merchant\" in 1926.\n\nEnriko Josif\n\nEnriko Josif (Belgrade, May 1, 1924 – Belgrade, March 13, 2003) was a Serbian composer, pedagogue, music writer, professor and member of the Serbian Academy of Sciences and Arts.\n\nHe was born in a Jewish Sephardic family as Hayim Yosif, but his father, Mosha Yosif, a merchant and representative of German and Italian companies, otherwise a fan of music and a fan of the famous Italian tenor Enrico Caruso, affectionately called him Enriko. Mother Sofia, educated in Switzerland, was a translator and a member of the international PEN club.\n\nThe Josif family spent the war years in exile. After the end of the war, they return to Belgrade, where Enriko continued his education and graduated from the First Belgrade Gymnasium. He graduated from the Academy of Music in the class of Professor Milenko Živković in 1954. He began his career as a music pedagogue in 1955 at the \"Vojislav Vučković\" Junior Music School (1955–1956) and the \"Kornelije Stanković\" Secondary Music School (1955–1957). He became the Assistant Lecturer at the Department of Composition at the Academy of Music in 1957 under his Professor Milenko Živković. During 1961 and 1962, he stayed in Rome for further studies, and after Živković's sudden death in 1964, he took over his chair at the Department of Composition. He was elected Assistant Professor in 1965, became Associate Professor in 1970, and earned the title of Full Professor in 1976. He worked as a Full Professor until his retirement in 1989.\n\nHe was elected a corresponding member of SANU in 1991, and became a regular member in 2000.\n\nHe composed numerous vocal and instrumental, chamber, choral and orchestral pieces, among which the most famous are \"Sonata Antika\", \"Death of Stefan Dečanski\", \"Concerto for Piano and Orchestra\", \"Hamlet\" and others.\n\nEnriko Josif died in Belgrade on March 13, 2003. He was buried at the Jewish Cemetery.\n\nVladeta Jerotić\n\nVladeta Jerotić (Belgrade, August 2, 1924 – Belgrade, September 4, 2018) was a doctor, neuropsychiatrist and psychotherapist, professor, philosopher, writer and member of the Serbian Academy of Sciences and Arts. He graduated from the Second Male Gymnasium in Belgrade, then from the Faculty of Medicine in 1951, where he specialized in neuropsychiatry in 1957. He specialized in psychotherapy in Switzerland, Germany and France from 1958 to 1961.\n\nUntil 1963, he worked as an Assistant at the University Neurology Clinic, and when the first psychotherapeutic department was established at the \"Dragiša Mišović\" hospital, Vladeta Jerotić moved to work with the Primarius, Dr. Vladislav Klajn. During the decades of work on the development of psychotherapy in Serbia, he gained extensive experience in working with patients and obtained the title Primarius.\n\nIn 1985, at the Orthodox Faculty of Theology, he participated in the establishment of the Department of Pastoral Psychology and Medicine and devoted himself completely to pedagogical and scientific work, definitively leaving the hospital and psychotherapy. Interest that went beyond medicine and nourished the research spirit led Jerotić to cultural anthropology and resulted in over 70 books and several hundred scientific articles in the fields of psychotherapy, sociology, social psychiatry and philosophy. In addition to extensive journalistic activities and research work, he held a series of lectures throughout Yugoslavia and Serbia.\n\nSince 1984, Vladeta Jerotić was a member of the Association of Writers. He was also a regular member of the Academy of Medical Sciences and a member of the Serbian Medical Society (psychotherapeutic section), the Psychotherapeutic Society of Yugoslavia, as well as the Jung Association in Belgrade. He was elected a corresponding member of the Serbian Academy of Sciences and Arts, Department of Languages and Literature in 1994, and a full member in 2000. He is the recipient of numerous recognitions and awards for his scientific work and social contribution. He died on September 4, 2018 in Belgrade.\n\nMira Trailović\n\nMirjana Mira Trailović (Kraljevo, January 22, 1924 – Belgrade, August 7, 1989) was a prominent Yugoslav theatre and film director, one of the founders and a long-time manager of Atelje 212, one of the most important theatre centres in the former Yugoslavia. Her overall contribution to culture in our region is extremely important, and her works left a deep and lasting impression.\n\nShe was born into a bourgeois family, her father was a translator, and her mother was a professor. She entered public life as an announcer at Radio Belgrade in 1944, where she later became a director and editor of the drama program. She graduated in directing in 1956 at the Faculty of Dramatic Arts in Belgrade, and later taught radio directing there. As her graduation thesis, she directed a concert performance of Goethe's \"Faust\" at the opening of Atelje 212 on November 12, 1956.\n\nThe establishment of the Atelje 212 theatre, at that time an avant-garde theatre known for its innovative performances that often challenged social norms and taboos, but were also extremely popular with the audience, is one of Mira Trailović's most significant achievements, although not the only one. Together with Jovan Ćirilov, she founded the Belgrade International Theatre Festival BITEF in 1967, and was its artistic director until the end of her life. In 1989, she participated in the founding of the Bitef Theatre.\n\nOn the stage of Atelje 212, she staged some of the cult performances of this theatre – the rock opera \"Jesus Christ Superstar\", the musical \"Hair\", the play \"Miracle in Šargan\" and numerous other, and thanks to her engagement as artistic director of Bitef, Belgrade hosted the biggest names of the avant-garde theatre of that time – Jean-Paul Sartre, Thomas Eliot, Eugène Ionesco, Samuel Beckett, etc.\n\nKnown for her brave and committed approach to theatre and active social engagement, Mira Trailović made a huge contribution and left a deep mark in the world of art and culture. She died in Belgrade in 1989.\n\nExpert collaboration: ”Svetozar Marković” University Library, Belgrade\n\nArtistic realization of the issue: Boban Savić MA, academic painter\n\nTechnical details\n\nDate of issue: 14. 3. 2024.\n\nNumber of stamps in set: 4\n\n1305: 48.00 дин, тираж: 25.000\n\n1306: 48.00 дин, тираж: 25.000\n\n1307: 48.00 дин, тираж: 25.000\n\n1308: 48.00 дин, тираж: 25.000\n\nКоверат првог дана (FDC) са жигом: 4\n\nТабак: 8\n\nДимензије марака: 35 x 47,85 mm\n\nШтампа: вишебојни офсет\n\nЗупчање: чешљасто 13 3/4\n\nШтампарија: Форум Нови Сад\n\nУметничка реализација: Бобан Савић\n\nНацрт: 1305.

Heroes consciously expose themselves to danger and risk in order to protect and defend those who are unable to defend themselves. Heroism is best perceived when times are hard, when they are most difficult – in war conditions, natural disasters and other crises.\n\n25 years ago, Serbia was a victim of NATO aggression, which lasted 78 days and took thousands of lives, including more than eighty children. Our citizens died in the bombing of a bus in Lužane, a passenger train in Grdelica Gorge, the building of the Radio Television of Serbia in Belgrade, under cluster bombs in Aleksinac, Niš, Varvarin and Novi Pazar and in many other places on the territory of Serbia.\n\nThe heroes who, from the first enemy attacks, on March 24, 1999, defended Serbia in the actions of the army and the police in Kosovo and Metohija, in airplanes in the sky above Serbia and in anti-aircraft defence positions on the ground, will remain in the eternal memory of generations as an example of how to love and defend the homeland despite everything. The heroes we remember today are as well all our citizens who expressed opposition to aggression – protesting on the bridges, squares and streets of Serbia or conscientiously performing their duties in the most difficult moments of our country’s recent history.\n\nThe Post of Serbia publishes the issue of commemorative postage stamps “25 years of commemorating the heroes of the homeland” as a sign of gratitude to all heroes, known and unknown, brave individuals who laid down their lives defending the homeland a quarter of a century ago, as well as to all those heroes who contributed to the defence of our country by their actions at that time.\n\nThe heroes of the homeland, who defended Serbia in 1999, collectively entered the memory of the nation and established the best example of patriotism for all future generations of our people. Glory and thanks be to the heroes of the homeland!\n\nArtistic realization of the issue: MA Jakša Vlahović, academic graphic artist\n\nTechnical details\n\nDate of issue: 22. 3. 2024.\n\nNumber of stamps in set: block with 1 stamp\n\nDenomination and printrun:\n\nBlock 111: 12.00 RSD, 10.000\n\nFDC: 1\n\nArtistic realization: Jakša Vlahović\n\nSubject: 25 years of commemoration of the heroes of the homeland\n\nBlock 111: National landmarks of the Republic of Serbia with symbolic display of war heroes, freedom and peace.\n\nIssue format: block\n\nDimensions of the block: 96 x 78 mm\n\nDimensions of the stamp in block: 35 x 49.3 mm\n\nPerforations: 13 3/4\n\nPrinter: Forum Novi Sad\n\nBranko Radičević (Slavonski Brod, March 28, 1824 – Vienna, July 1, 1853), a great poet of Serbian romanticism, introduced revolutionary changes in the development of Serbian literature and language. He was born to his father Todor and mother Ruža just before the holiday of St. Alexius, after whom he got his baptismal name. He lived in Slavonski Brod (Brod na Savi) with his family until 1830. Until 1835, he studied at Serbian and German elementary schools in Zemun. From 1835 to 1841, he studied at the Karlovac Gymnasium – \"the most excellent student\" with calligraphic handwriting and the best herbarium with plants from Stražilovo. In Timisoara from 1841 to 1843, he studied philosophy. There he writes his first poem in Serbian – Girl at the Well. He moved to Vienna to study law, which he did not like.\n\nWith the publication of his first book, \"Poems\" (1847), he translated his name from Greek (Alexios) into Serbian – Branko, and his first poetic debut caused a tectonic upheaval on the literary scene. With the encouragement of Vuk Stefanović Karadžić, the divinely inspired Branko brings into Serbian poetry the ozone-pure beauty of the vernacular language as opposed to the artificial Slavonic Serbian in the literary use of that era.\n\nHe contracted tuberculosis and died in 1853 at the age of twenty-nine. After three decades (1883), his remains were transferred from Vienna to Stražilovo. On Stražilovo, there is a monument made of mountain blocks from the areas where Serbs live: Fruška gora, Dinara, Klek, Lovćen, Plješevica, Vršački Breg, Velebit and Avala. On the top of the marble monument, in golden letters it says: TO BRANKO – THE SERBIAN PEOPLE. It is the sign of the libertarian Kolo (circle dance) from the poem The Parting of School Friends, in which Branko invites all Serbs who suffer under the yoke of the Austrian and Turkish empires to unite, naming them after the regions, (sub)regions and areas where they have always lived.\n\nEven though he wrote only fifty-four lyrical poems, seven epics, two fragments of epics, a handful of letters and one response to criticism, the importance of Branko Radičević is epochal and inspiring for new generations. Many of the poems are anthological: As I Thought of Dying, Prayer, Reprimand, Curse, (Nikad nije vito tvoje telo), In Memory of Mina Karadžić (Pevam danju, pevam noću), Fisherman's Dream, Sorrow and Admonition, Mischief, A Traveller at Dawn and others. There are about a hundred musical compositions based on Branko's verses that leave the impression that the people themselves created these poems.\n\nProfessional cooperation: Nenad Grujičić, “Brankovo kolo”\n\nArtistic realization: Miroslav Nikolić and Nadežda Skočajić, Academic Graphic Artist\n\nTechnical details\n\nDate of issue: 21. 06. 2024.\n\nNumber of stamps in set: 1\n\nDenomination and printrun:\n\n1331: 48.00 RSD, 25.000\n\nFDC: 1\n\nArtistic realization: Nadežda Skočajić\n\nSubject: 200th Anniversary of the birth of Branko Radičević\n\n1331: portrait of Branko Radičević\n\nIssue format: sheet of 8\n\nDimensions of stamps: 42 x 33,35 mm\n\nPerforations: 13 3/4\n\nPrinter: Forum Novi Sad\n\nDiplomatic relations between Serbia and Canada were formally established only in 1941, but today a large and influential Serbian community has been present in this North American country since the end of the 19th century.\n\nOne of the most prominent residents of Canada of Serbian origin, Milomir Glavčić, a native of the village of Pope near Jošanička Banja, the Canadian with the longest residential address in Niagara Falls, is celebrating his hundredth birthday this year.\n\nBorn on 6 December, 1924, he spent his childhood and youth in pre-war Yugoslavia in misery and poverty. After the end of the Second World War, he settled in Canada, where, through hard and thoughtful work, he managed to acquire wealth for himself and others.\n\nMilomir Glavčić is a true member of the world of humanity and philanthropy. He helped people regardless of religion and nation. In Canada, he invested considerable funds for the construction of a church and a hospital in Niagara Falls, and in his native Serbia, he helped build a bridge over the Ibar in Kraljevo, which not only connected the banks of this river, but also two countries – Canada and Serbia, and today the cities of friends – Kraljevo and Niagara Falls, as evidenced by the markings on this building.\n\nHe also financed the construction of churches, kindergartens, centres of culture, library buildings, asphalting of roads, and renovation of elementary schools. He donated medical devices and ambulances to hospitals in Kraljevo and Raška. He helped, and continues to help, both close and distant relatives, but also hundreds of unknown families. In Serbia, his charity is kept from being forgotten. Streets, a boulevard, a kindergarten, and a cultural centre are named after him in the area of the Raški district. He is the winner of numerous awards, as well as the highest state and church awards. In Canada, as a sign of respect, on his 99th birthday, Niagara Falls were painted with the colours of the Serbian flag.\n\nThanks to Milomir Glavčić, in 2015 the first Serbian–Canadian Friendship Charter in modern history was signed, which is a significant step in the improvement of bilateral relations between the two countries, especially in terms of cultural exchange and economic cooperation and investments.\n\nArtistic realization of the issue: Boban Savić MA, academic painter\n\nTechnical details\n\nDate of issue: 27. 06. 2024.\n\nNumber of stamps in set: block with 1 stamp\n\nDenomination and printrun:\n\nBlock 114: 136.00 RSD, 10.000\n\nFDC: 1\n\nArtistic realization: Boban Savić\n\nSubject: Serbia – Canada: 100 years since the birth of Milomir Glavčić\n\nBlock 114: The bridge and the portrait of Milomir Glavčić\n\nIssue format: block\n\nDimensions of the block: 85 x 80 mm\n\nDimensions of the stamp in block: 35 x 49,3 mm\n\nPerforations: 13 3/4\n\nPrinter: Forum Novi Sad\n\nThis year we mark 110 years since the beginning of the First World War, one of the largest military conflicts in the history of civilization, in which more than 70 million people under arms participated. The army of the small Balkan state of Serbia will be remembered for its heroic epic, which began with the Battle of Cer in 1914, the first allied victory in the First World War against the incomparably more numerous Austro-Hungarian forces, followed by the Albanian Golgotha in 1915 and the landing on Corfu in 1916, continuing with the great and significant victory at Kaimaktsalan in 1916 and finally, the breakthrough of the Thessaloniki front in 1918 and the proud rush to the final liberation of the Homeland.\n\nDuring the entire war, Serbian soldiers stood out for their courage, endurance, resilience and chivalry, despite the difficult conditions and enemy superiority. The civilian population in occupied Serbia suffered terribly due to the occupation and war operations, but still remained determined to support their soldiers in the fight for freedom, showing national unity and solidarity.\n\nSerbia emerged from the First World War as one of the victorious countries, but it paid for it with huge losses – it is estimated that more than a million people were killed or wounded during the war that forever changed the course of history.\n\nStamp motif: Monument to the Unknown Hero on Avala, Ivan Meštrović, 1938.\n\nMotifs on the vignettes: Heroes – Serbian soldiers from the period of the First World War and Serbian decorations; from the collection of the Adligat Society, the legacy of Leko family.Motifs on the First Day Cover: photos of heroes – Serbian soldiers and civilians from the First World War period and artillery shells that Serbian soldiers engraved, processed into cups and used in the trenches; from the collection of the Adligat Society, the legacy of Leko family.\n\nProfessional cooperation: Society for culture, art and international cooperation Adligat, Belgrade.\n\nArtistic realization of the issue: MA Jakša Vlahović, academic graphic artist\n\nTechnical details\n\nDate of issue: 28. 06. 2024.\n\nNumber of stamps in set: 1\n\nDenomination and printrun:\n\n1333: 48.00 RSD, 25.000\n\nFDC: 1\n\nArtistic realization: Jakša Vlahović\n\nSubject: 110 years of commemoration of the heroes of the First World War\n\n1333: Monument to the Unknown Hero on Avala\n\nIssue format: sheet of 10\n\nDimensions of stamps: 35 x 31,9 mm\n\nPerforations: 13 3/4\n\nPrinter: Forum Novi Sad\n\nSerbia and France established contacts as early as the Middle Ages, as evidenced by the marriage of King Uroš with Princess Jelena of Anjou. The modern era brings new contacts between the two countries at the beginning of the 19th century, at the time of the First Serbian Uprising, and the formal establishment of diplomatic relations took place in 1839, when France opened the first consulate in the Principality of Serbia. The second half of the 19th century brought an intensification of relations and cultural influence brought to Serbia by numerous ”French students”, among whom were members of both Serbian dynasties, which led to the strengthening of French friendship with Serbia, which was especially confirmed by the alliance in the First World War, when France stood by Serbia from the beginning, helping it financially, but also through numerous medical missions, treating Serbian wounded in French hospitals, educating Serbian pupils and students in French schools and finally, in brotherhood in arms – the joint battles of Serbian and French soldiers at the Salonica front. Today, Belgrade is the only city outside of France to be awarded the Legion of Honour, and Belgrade’s bohemian district of Skadarlija is the only one in the world that is twinned with Montmartre in Paris.\n\nThe friendship between Serbia and France was confirmed by the fight against the common enemy – Nazism, during the Second World War, as well as by economic cooperation in the 20th century, and bilateral relations in the 21st century have seen an increase in the formation of a strategic partnership between the two countries, recent visits by top officials and the personal friendship of the presidents of the two countries. Economic cooperation has been intensively developing in the last few years, and France has been among the biggest investors in the Serbian economy and the most important foreign trade partners of Serbia for years.\n\nMotif on the stamp: Prince Miloš Obrenović and King Louis-Philippe I\n\nMotif on the vignette: Monument of gratitude to France at Kalemegdan in Belgrade, work of sculptor Ivan Meštrović; building of the Embassy of the Republic of France in Belgrade\n\nMotif on the envelope: Freedom, Equality, Fraternity, sculpture on the building of the Embassy of France in Belgrade\n\nArtistic realisation of the issue: MA Marija Vlahovic, academic graphic artist\n\nTechnical details\n\nDate of issue: 12. 07. 2024.\n\nNumber of stamps in set: 1\n\nDenomination and printrun:\n\n1334: 48.00 RSD, 25.000\n\nFDC: 1\n\nArtistic realization: Marija Vlahović\n\nSubject: 185 years of diplomatic relations between Serbia and France\n\n1334: Prince Miloš Obrenović and King Louis-Philippe I\n\nIssue format: sheet of 10\n\nDimensions of stamps: 42 x 31,9 mm\n\nPerforations: 13 3/4\n\nPrinter: Forum Novi Sad"
