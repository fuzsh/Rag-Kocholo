Four men travel into the Sahara in search of the lost kingdom of Mur: an old doctor looking for his lost son, a professor in search of learning, and a young man in search of adventure with his old sergeant.\n\nQueen Sheba's Ring, 1910\n\nHenry Rider Haggard\n\nThe inhabitants of Mur, the Abati-one of the lost tribes of Israel, now in the decline of their civilisation fallen into effete cowardice and lethargy. Their queen-Maqueda, the Child of Kings, descended from Solomon and the Queen of Sheba, one of the few Abati that still shows courage and enterprise.\n\nQueen Sheba's Ring, 1910\n\nHenry Rider Haggard\n\nTheir enemies-the warlike and vigorous Fung, who worship the gigantic lion-headed sphinx Harmac. The mission: blow up the mountainous sphinx, thus demoralising and dispersing the Fung and rescuing the Abati people from extinction.\n\nQueen Sheba's Ring, 1910\n\nHenry Rider Haggard\n\nRescue the doctor's son from the Fung. Escape death by lion. And do it all without falling foul of the villainous Joshua, Prince of the Abati, and without falling in love with the spirited Maqueda, for which the penalty is death. More easily said than done.. More\n\nQueen Sheba's Ring, 1910\n\nHenry Rider Haggard\n\nRed Eve, 1911\n\nH Rider Haggard\n\nRed Eve. When Eve Clattering-known as Red Eve because she always dresses in red--is betrothed to Sir Edmund Acour, Count of Noyon, it goes against her will and her every instinct. Rumors of Sir Edmund's treachery have reached her ears, and she suspects may be planning to seize the throne of England. Hugh de Cressi, Eve's true love, must rise above his station, help save the king . . . and win Red Eve for his own!

There is a man who has lost his wife and daughter. He is the sole survivor in the accident and feels great guilt. And in this guilt, he begins to drink more and more each day. Then one day as the man was contemplating suicide, a stranger named Joren comes along and tells him not to worry. He tells him of reincarnated souls, of a life beyond the mortal one, and he teaches the man to transcend his physical body.

Rider Haggard.\n\nThe Mahatma and the Hare\" was first published in book form in 1911, and is one of H. Rider Haggard's rarer titles. The idea for this short novel came to Haggard, he states in the book's preface, after he had read a newspaper account of a hare that had swum out to sea to avoid being captured by pursuing hounds.\n\nThe Mahatma and the Hare: A Dream Story, 1911\n\nH. Rider Haggard\n\nIn Haggard's story, the self-called mahatma--a spiritual man who is able, when asleep, to view \"The Great White Road\" on which the souls of those recently departed enter heaven--encounters the hare of the title after that animal's death.\n\nThe hare tells the mahatma of the hardships and cruelties of his recent life: of how his entire family had been hunted to extinction; of his narrow escapes from hunters, greyhounds, and other hunting dogs; and, finally, of how he met his end. The hare also gets to debate the issue of animal rights with his chief hunter/enemy, near the book's end. This hunter is given time to plead his case, but Haggard's sympathies (and the reader's) are certainly with the poor, oppressed hare. More\n\nMarie is 1912 novel by H.

But Kallikrates does not arrive alone—he is pursued by the Pharaoh's daughter who is wildly jealous of Ayesha's beauty and vows to destroy her. Only by staying true to Isis does Ayesha survive, and as a reward Isis leads her to the hidden kingdom of Kôr in Africa, to herald in a new Golden Age.

Narrative tension is further weakened by the priest-prophets' tendency to announce that an imminent disaster will turn out okay for the prince and princess.

This time they venture to an unexplored part of Africa and to a tribe with occult powers. Although what relationship this tribe might have with the vestiges of Antlantean culture remains unclear until the final pages. There is plenty of drama and suspense and the mystical love dimension. Quartermain as narrator does not express Haggard's world view - far from it.

Rider Haggard\n\nMary of Marion Isle is a 1929 novel by H Rider Haggard. It was his penultimate novel and was published posthumously.\n\nMary of Marion Isle, 1929. This posthumous novel is a strange medley of realism and fantasy, of sentimentality and shrewd observation. Opening with some graphic chapters of London life, both West and East End, it suddenly resolves itself into an idyll on a desert island. Andrew West is an idealistic medical student. Heir, in certain almost inevitable cir- cumstances, to the Atterton estates, he chooses the career of a Whitechapel doctor.\n\nMary of Marion Isle, 1929\n\nH. Rider Haggard\n\nAfter an innocent but disillusioning love affair with another• girl, -he is trapped into marriage with his ambitious ctounin; Clara Maimsell, -and-in due time he becomes Lord Atterton and a politician. Through his wife's scheming, he is appointed to the Governorship of Oceania. But, being wrecked on the voyage, he escapei with his servant, who soon dies, to Marion Isle, where he meets, as the sole inhabitant, a beautiful English girl who had been similarly stranded there some years before. The life of Andrew and Mary on the island, with -the inevitable love climax, is described with both vigour and charm, though as an attempt to show the healthy simplicity which civilization has sacrificed to greed and sophistication, the story is too far-fetched to be convincing.
