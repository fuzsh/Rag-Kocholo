        "text": "His character, Tarzan, first appeared in a pulp fiction magazine in 1912, and the first book about him was published in June 1914.\n\nAuthor Edgar Rice Burroughs followed that with books numbering 23 featuring his exciting character.\n\nThe character's background included his birth in Africa, becoming an orphan, and then raised by apes. His real name was given to him as John Clayton, but since he was brought up by an ape family, they named him Tarzan, which meant “white skin.”\n\nThe Tarzan character is one of the best known in the world because of the books, the prolific number of films, television programs, radio shows, comic strips and comic books which have been produced over the years.\n\nOn radio, Tarzan was portrayed by radio actor James Pierce from 1932 to 1936 and by Lamont Johnson from 1951 to 1953.\n\nJungle life had taught Tarzan the elements of survival, but also the traits of helpfulness, leadership, loyalty, courage and physical strength.\n\nAfter the first Tarzan book by Burroughs, his character was featured in serialized magazines, and in 1918 the first silent film about him was produced, titled \"Tarzan of The Apes,\" starring Elmo Lincoln. Subsequent films followed with such titles as \"Tarzan\" and \"The Golden Lion\" and \"The Revenge of Tarzan.\"\n\nJohnny Weissmuller starred in 12 films followed by other actors, including Ron Ely. A series on television was also created in the late 1960s.\n\nTarzan became an important character in newspaper comics in 1927.\n\nAlong the way, Burroughs, who also wrote science fiction stories about life on other planets, changed the story line for Tarzan and brought him to civilization only to soon reject that plot and return his Tarzan to his life as a hero/adventurer.\n\nAs a young adult, Tarzan met a young American woman, Jane Porter, and later they married and had one son, Jack, who takes on the ape name of Korak. (In films his son's name is simply, Boy.)\n\nCultural historians generally conclude that Tarzan's official “start” as a character was in 1914, making this year his 100th anniversary!\n\nIn his many adventures over the years Tarzan takes the side of a weaker individual being preyed upon by a stronger foe.\n\nHe preferred his clothes to be brief, including a knife and a loincloth of animal hide.\n\nHis admirers were many and included Jane Goodall who claimed she was influenced by Burroughs and his “noble savage” when she was a child. She stated once that she felt she would have been a much better spouse for Tarzan than the one Burroughs provided.\n\nWhen Goodall began her study of chimpanzees living among them, it was fulfilling her childhood dreams of living among the great apes as Tarzan did.\n\nBurroughs himself was influenced, regarding his creation of Tarzan, by Rudyard Kipling's character, Mowgli!\n\nTarzan's basic upbringing provided him with abilities far beyond ordinary male humans. Those abilities included climbing, clinging and leaping much as a great ape might demonstrate. He could also communicate with many types of animals.\n\nBefore finally naming his character, “Tarzan”, Burroughs had considered the names, “Zantar” and “Tublat Zan.”\n\nCultural historians regard Burroughs as a vivid storyteller, and, in 1963, author Gore Vidal praised Burroughs for creating an interesting “daydream figure.”\n\nHistorically Speaking, which appears Sundays, presents short historical stories written by Richard Curland of the Norwich Historical Society in cooperation with society president Bill Champagne.
