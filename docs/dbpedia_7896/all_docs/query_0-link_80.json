        "text": "The first weekend of the month, I traveled to San Antonio to attend the 2022 Edgar Rice Burroughs Dum Dum. This convention moves around the country, but this year it was in Texas and didn’t conflict with Robert E. Howard Days like it’s done in the past. I’d like to thank John Bullard for letting me know about it and graciously allowing me to crash at his house. Continue reading →\n\nI’m up to my armpits in dayjobbery, so this post almost didn’t get done. But I wanted to point out two birthdays that fall on this date, September 1.\n\nFirst is Edgar Rice Burroughs (1875-1950). Do I really have to tell you what all he wrote? Tarzan. John Carter. Pellucidar.\n\nThen there’s Harold Lamb (1892-1962). Lamb was a master of historical adventure, arguably the greatest author of that genre ever. He was a major influence on Robert E. Howard.\n\nI doubt we shall see their equals any time soon.\n\nSo what are your favorite works by Burroughs and Lamb. Let us know in the comments.\n\nSo yesterday’s post on Edgar Rice Burroughs and Harold Lamb and the recent post on the canon, coupled with today is the anniversary of the passing of J. R. R. Tolkien and the seventh anniversary of the death of Frederik Pohl, got me to thinking. I referred to Burroughs and Lamb as giants. In the canon post I quoted Newton talking about his achievements being due to his standing on the shoulders of giants.\n\nSo who exactly are the giants in the field? Continue reading →\n\nI’m trying to get ready to start the second summer term, so this is going to be short. But I wanted to point out that today was Roy G. Krenkel’s 98th birthday. Krenkel is best remembered today for his work with early comics giants such as Al Williamson and paperback covers for Ace, DAW, and Lancer.\n\nKrenkel was a friend of Frank Frazetta, of whom Frazetta said, “I met Roy Krenkel back in 1949 or 1950, and he has never ceased to be a constant source of inspiration to me—a truly conscientious artist who will not tolerate incompetence.”\n\nMuch of Krenkel’s best remembered work was for fantasy adventure, particularly Edgar Rice Burroughs and Robert E. Howard. Edgar Rice Burroughs grandson Danton Burroughs considered him to be one of the great ERB illustrators."
