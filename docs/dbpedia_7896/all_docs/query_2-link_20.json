        "text": "Hopefully this one will work for people. I’ve been playing with timelines of fantasy’s big moment that sent the genre into overdrive around the 80s and how best to explain it, and am trying this.\n\nA flowchart. Hopefully it makes some sense on its own, but I will be including explanations for each genre and each movement of influence below\n\nNote – This is a rough and incomplete chart for reasons of space. In particular, it has deliberately omitted all non-fantastical genres to save space and also show influence within the field. That is not to say non-fantastical authors and genres have had no input. On the contrary, they’ve had a big input. Showing them all would be a nightmare; showing some inconsistent.\n\nAlso, the focus on movements rather than individuals has at times unfairly removed the influence of particular authors, for which I apologise and hope to cover in “authors without tradition”.\n\nWhat’s more, in being focused on fantasy in the genre on the shelf, this doesn’t cover the children’s genre or literary fantasy, for much the same reasons of space as previously cited.\n\nFinally, this is a draft, and all feedback, suggestions, corrections, and questions are greatly appreciated:\n\nI wish I had a bigger sheet to stick in everything in there, but I don’t, so let’s go…\n\nRomanticism: The European literary and artistic movement with a focus on individualism, emotion, nature, and the unknown that flourished most between 1800 and 1850\n\nEastern Mediterranean Epics: A grab-all category for Graeco-Roman Epics, Biblical Mythology, and the Arabian Nights; it is brutally reductionist to put them all together, but again, saves space.\n\nFairy Tales: European folk tales as recorded and altered by collectors such as the Brothers Grimm, and as created by authors such as Hans Christian Andersen and ETA Hoffman\n\nGothic and Cosmic Horror: A grab-all category for the supernatural and brooding horror that starts with Walpole’s gothic, is popularised by Poe, continues with Machen and Chambers, and grows a mutating Cosmic arm with Hodgson and Lovecraft\n\nEarly British Fantasy: A grab-all category for George MacDonald, William Morris, Lord Dunsany, and ER Eddison, and a few less famous others.\n\nLost World: The late-Victorian genre focused around finding undiscovered places, often with supernatural underpinnings; prominent authors include H Rider Haggard, Edgar Rice Burroughs, and Abraham Merritt.\n\nNorse Sagas: The surviving myth and legend of Scandinavia from the Viking Age (should have given this a broader title to include the Anglo-Saxon Beowulf, oops).\n\nPlanetary Romance: Swashbuckling adventures on foreign planets, most notably Mars, often fantastical in feel. Edgar Rice Burroughs and Leigh Brackett are the most prominent names here.\n\nSword & Sorcery: Tales of lone adventurers in pre-historic/early medieval settings, replete with horror elements. Originated by RE Howard, taken up by Clark Ashton Smith, CL Moore, Henry Kuttner, Jack Vance and Fritz Leiber.\n\nTolkien: A movement unto himself, and the writer of the book that changed the genre’s fortunes.\n\nNew Wave: Predominantly a sci-fi movement, many of its luminaries such as Le Guin, Roger Zelazny, Samuel R Delany, and Michael Moorcock would go on to produce landmark fantasy works.\n\nDungeons & Dragons: Gygax’s game not only inspired a gaming industry, but codified a version of fantasy that would have a powerful ongoing impact.\n\nAuthors Without Tradition: An apology to authors like James Branch Cabell, Poul Anderson, TH White, Mervyn Peake, Hope Mirrlees, and so on, who undoubtedly contributed to the genre’s make up prior to that great explosion, but whose uniqueness make them difficult to place.\n\nFantasy Explosion: The Epic Fantasy authors such as Terry Brooks, David Eddings, Robert Jordan, Mercedes Lackey, Tad Williams, Weis & Hickman, Feist & Wurts and so on who established that fantasy could be big business from the 80s on.\n\nAnd now for the influence arrows!\n\nA – Romanticism to Gothic/Cosmic Horror: Regard this as much of an offshoot as anything, as Poe is regarded as the first and a founder of the second. Poe’s influence here is enormous.\n\nB – Romanticism to Early British Fantasy: A heavy influence; MacDonald and Morris were heavily influenced by Romantic poets and Dunsany by Poe.\n\nC – Eastern Mediterranean Myth to Early British Fantasy: Found mainly in Dunsany’s study of Greek and the Bible, and Eddison’s influences from Homer and Sappho.\n\nD – Fairy Tales to Early British Fantasy: MacDonald was inspired by Hoffman’s marchen, Morris by Ruskin, and Dunsany by the Brothers Grimm and Andersen.\n\nE – Gothic/Cosmic Horror to Early British Fantasy: A two-way street found in Poe’s influence on Morris and Dunsany, and Dunsany’s influence on Lovecraft and Smith.\n\nF – Gothic/Cosmic Horror to Sword & Sorcery: Sword & Sorcery to no small extent is a child of Horror, something seen mostly clearly in Smith’s contributions; Lovecraft’s influence on this group was huge. Authors like Poe and Machen also exerted influence on this group too.\n\nG – Romanticism to Sword & Sorcery: Both Smith and Moore showed influence from the Romantic poets, beyond the general influence of Poe on Howard, Smith and Leiber.\n\nH – Eastern Mediterranean Myth to Sword & Sorcery: Primarily felt in the Arbain Nights, cited as an influence on both Fritz Leiber and Clask Ashton Smith.\n\nI – Early British Fantasy to Tolkien: Tolkien owned a debt to all of MacDonald, Morris, Dunsany, and Eddison, most of them being observable through his work or letters.\n\nJ – Norse Sagas to Early British Fantasy: Mainly an influence on William Morris and ER Eddison.\n\nK – Planetary Romance to Sword & Sorcery: A two way street with Edgar Rice Burroughs influencing Howard and Moore, who in turn were influences on Leigh Brackett along with Henry Kuttner.\n\nL – Lost World to Sword & Sorcery: Beyond the above influence of Edgar Rice Burroughs, we also see H Rider Haggard to Howard and Abraham Merritt to Moore and Kuttner.\n\nM – Lost World to Tolkien: Tolkien was a big fan of H Rider Haggard.\n\nN – Norse Sagas to Tolkien: Yup.\n\nO – Planetary Romance to New Wave: Michael Moorcock has expounded on length on the debt the New Wave owes to Leigh Brackett, and both he and Delany had influences going back directly to Burroughs, while Zelazny drew from Ray Bradbury.\n\nP – Sword & Sorcery to New Wave: While in many ways a mostly second-hand influence from Leigh Brackett, Moorcock was influenced by Fritz Leiber and Delany was a Howard reader.\n\nQ – Sword & Sorcery to Fantasy Explosion: The list of authors influenced by Howard and Leiber is too big for this exercise; suffice to say it was major, and that Sword & Sorcery was also important in creating the commercial space needed for Tolkien.\n\nR – Sword & Sorcery to Dungeons & Dragons: Most of what D&D is came from Sword & Sorcery, as any look at Appendix N will confirm.\n\nS – Tolkien to Dungeons & Dragons: While a far lesser contributor to D&D than the above, Tolkien’s work was nevertheless critical in terms of establishing the aesthetic, particularly when it came to non-human races.\n\nT – Tolkien to Fantasy Explosion: Beyond creating a thirst for new works, Tolkien’s model of quest and resurgent dark lord would be very influential, particularly on Terry Brooks and Stephen Donaldson\n\nU – New Wave to Fantasy Explosion: While less obviously influential, they were still part of establishing the marketplace, and authors like Zelazny and Le Guin were influential on the next generation.\n\nV – Dungeons & Dragons to Fantasy Explosion: The impact of D&D and other RPGs went beyond increasing fantasy’s audience, but also had a very direct effect on fantasy, particularly the type of epic fantasy where wizards are extraordinarily mighty, and an even more direct effect with tie-in fiction like Weis & Hickman’s Dragonlance.\n\nW – Authors Without Tradition: In hindsight, this shouldn’t be here in this way (the curse of thinking through posts as you do them). The impact of authors like Cabell, Anderson, Peake and so on is mostly felt upstream of the fantasy explosion – Cabell on S&S, Anderson and Peake on Moorcock, and so on. By and large, the fantasy authors of the big explosion did not draw directly on these authors. But putting this here acknowledges it’s more than just the notable subgenres before this period.\n\nPhew.\n\nThank you to everyone who read all that, and any questions or comments, let me know below."
