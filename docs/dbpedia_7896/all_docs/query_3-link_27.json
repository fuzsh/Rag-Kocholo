Octavo, pp. [i-vi] vii-xii [xiii-xvi] 1-326 [327] [328: blank], five inserted plates with illustrations by Frank E. Schoonover, original dark brown cloth, front and spine panels stamped in orange. First edition. The first book of the Mars series. Burroughs' first published story (written in 1911) and his only story to originally appear under a pseudonym. The story first appeared under the byline \"Norman Bean\" (he had intended that pen name be \"Normal Bean\") as a six-part serial \"Under the Moons of Mars\" in a Munsey magazine, THE ALL-STORY, February-July 1912. This novel preceded the first publication of \"Tarzan of the Apes,\" published in the October 1912 issue of THE ALL-STORY. This popular novel inspired numerous writers and influenced the space faring sword and raygun stories as well as influencing scientists and filmakers. \"...this pioneering account of John Carter's magical transmission to the the planet Mars and his subsequent baroque adventures established a new template for fiction set on other planets, developing such imaginative spaces as arenas for exuberantly uninhibited tales of exotic derring-do ... Although it hardly qualifies as science-based speculative fiction, Burroughs's account of Barsoom was enormously influential in pulp SF, standing at the head of a rich subgenre of 'planetary romances' whose evolution was carried forward by such writers as C. L. Moore, Leigh Brackett, and Ray Bradbury.\" - Anatomy of Wonder (2004) II-194.
