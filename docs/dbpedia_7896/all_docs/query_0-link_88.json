        "text": "The spark for this post was a book tag.\n\nThe fuel is the past and the uncomfortable awareness that a good deal of the genre we love has been shaped by deeply dubious beliefs.\n\nLet me expound. When doing the Book Sacrifice tag I was, as I so often am, tempted to steal an answer from the person I was copying the tag from. Zezee had gone with She as a book to sacrifice and I was tempted to go with it as H Rider Haggard has, well, a reputation. However, while hunting for an apposite quote I seemed to recall about the man, I discovered there’s good reason to think that She was heavily influential on Tolkien.\n\nI uhm’ed, aah’ed, then eventually decided to address it in this article.\n\nNow to a certain extent, all ideas with their roots in the past have roots in the minds of people we’d strenuously disagree with on some counts. It’s an inevitable part of humanity. However, in the case of fantasy, I think it is only right to acknowledge that it runs deeper. That a genre founded in no small part on the fears and exoticism of the UK and USA near the turn of the 20th century has absorbed many of the attitudes towards other ethnicities that informed said fears and exoticism.\n\nHaggard’s Lost World novels such as She and King Solomon’s Mines, in which white European adventurers discover lost civilisations in the wilds of Africa, are an example of this. Every fantasy story in which our brave heroes investigate lost cities or visit hidden civilisations (hello Moria, hello D&D) probably owes some debt somewhere to Haggard. Haggard’s inspiration was his own time in colonial Africa and visiting ruins such as Great Zimbabwe. While parts of Haggard’s fiction and private writings show a great admiration for the black Africans he met, other parts have led to descriptions such as Ngũgĩ wa Thiong’o’s “one of the geniuses of racism”. Without having read his work or delved into the criticisms thoroughly, I cannot comment all that much other to note that even well-meaning and lionising narratives about other cultures can still cause harm and offence.\n\nOther great influences are easier to nail down. Edgar Rice Burroughs was an explicit believer in eugenics and it’s often held that Tarzan was written in support of these views. He was also a big influence on many of the major S&S and British New Wave writers such as Robert E Howard, CL Moore, Michael Moorcock, and on and on, while his John Carter of Mars heavily influenced Superman. HP Lovecraft’s white supremacism is well known and to no small extent pulp stories featuring interbreeding between man and monster (see Shadows over Innsmouth, although other writers such as Robert E Howard were active here) reflect fears over miscegenation. I don’t think I need to point out how Howard and Lovecraft were influential. Something else easily found in Howard’s works, and those of other S&S writers of the time, are orientalist views in which the cultures of the east are depicted as corrupt, decadent, and stagnant.\n\nAnd of course then there is Tolkien who, while at times staunch in his criticism of the racism of the days, did manage write a trilogy where all the non-white European folk somehow managed to end up dominated by the dark powers and used by them in team evil. There’s also the critique that the dwarves represent anti-Semitic thinking too.\n\nFinding a fantasy author whose works show no influence from one of Haggard, Burroughs, Lovecraft, Howard and Tolkien (or someone influenced by them) is one hell of a task, and if you managed it they’re probably influenced by an author I skipped over to save time but was nevertheless at times promoting racist viewpoints. And through the ages, we’ve seen said influenced authors replicate some of these failings, either through unthinking mimickry or their own prejudices. Pratchett’s Interesting Times is undeniably orientalist. Eddings’ Belgariad repeats the casual giant ethnic divides of Tolkien (only less casually, and addressed somewhat in the Malloreon), while his Zemochs in the Elenium play the miscegenation card. So too do Jordan’s Trollocs and Myrrdraal to an extent.\n\nYet, at the same time, we’ve seen authors take ideas and divorce them from their original context to the point it seems weird to consider them in the same vein. Tolkien’s Moria might be inspired by Lost World stories, but it is hard to see prejudice in going through an abandoned dwarven mine with a fire demon. We see authors take ideas and riff thoughtfully on them. I do not know whether the Jewishness of Pratchett’s dwarves would have occurred without views on Tolkien’s, and I’ve seen that praised.\n\nWe’ve also seen authors of colour take these works as direct inspirations. See Charles R Saunders’ Imaro, which came to him while watching Tarzan and imagining a giant African warrior giving Tarzan a bloody good hiding, or Victor LaValle’s The Ballad of Black Tom.\n\nI would even go so far as to say that the fantasy created by these men, full of wonders about strange places and thoughts about living on the peripheries and fears of the world around them, has created an ideal vehicle for minority authors. The world urges them to wonder about strange and exotic places, they know a great deal about being on the periphery, and they are too often reason to fear – just often from a very different standpoint from fantasy’s forefathers.\n\nIt’s easy to turn tales about abused princesses into tales of abused princesses caught between the land of their birth and the land of their upbringing, as Aliette Bodard does in Fireheart Tiger. It is easy to connect with an audience that loves tales that riff on mythology by riffing on your mythology, as Marlon James did with Black Leopard Red Wolf, or fiddle with history and inject magic into it as Rebecca Kuang did with The Poppy War. The list could go on.\n\nIn many ways, ideas are like weapons, and one of those ways is once you make an idea anyone could grab hold of if. That’s as true of literary genres as it is of anything, and perhaps more so given the reading public’s constant thirst for something new. We always want to see something new happen.\n\nThe result is that fantasy, with its emphasis on adventure, survival, culture and outsiders, holds a great ability to both propagate racist views and to also disarm and challenge them. If its roots show a great deal of the former, today shows the latter. May that continue, and make the roots ever more of a footnote and academic curiosity – but it feels unwise and dishonest to try and forget that’s what happened to begin with."
