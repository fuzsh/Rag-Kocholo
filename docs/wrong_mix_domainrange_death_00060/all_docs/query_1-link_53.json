        "text": "Obituary of John Ford Taylor\n\nIt is with great sadness and broken hearts that we announce the unexpected passing of John Ford Taylor. Born in Chatham on April 1st 1930, he was the youngest son of the late Joseph Edward and Alice (Allie O’Connor) Taylor. Reunited with his beloved wife of 64 years, Barbara (Nov 5th 2022) and son Shaune (1991).\n\nHe will be deeply missed by his daughters, Karrie Labreche (Rick) of Granton and Myra Taylor-Joyes of Chatham. Dearest grandfather of Andrew Ellis (Crystal), Jason Ellis, Ashtyn Labreche (Chris), Shane Labreche, Brandon Joyes (Randi) and Colin Joyes, as well as 6 great grandchildren. “Uncle Jack” is survived by several loving nieces and nephews. Jack will also be dearly missed by many close friends, including his choir members and Brian Joyes.\n\nWith a singing career that started at the age of 8 and spanned over 7 decades, Dad was a very accomplished tenor, singing throughout Canada for the Federal government, as well as at many weddings, funerals and concerts. He was the director of music for over 40 years for St. Joseph’s Catholic Church, where his choir became like a second family. With a variety of careers, Dad’s true calling was that of a teacher with the former Kent County Roman Catholic Separate School Board.\n\nWe would like to express our deepest appreciation to the staff at Chatham Retirement Resort, the ER and surgical staff of CKHA for the care and compassion they provided.\n\nAs Jack requested, cremation has taken place.\n\nVisitation will be on Friday, January 20th 2023 at Hinnegan-Peseski Funeral Home (519-352-5120) from 2-5pm. A funeral mass will take place on Saturday, January 21st 2023 at St. Joseph’s Catholic Church, Chatham at 11am with visitation 1 hour prior to mass.\n\nA devout Catholic, one of Dad’s greatest memories was that of walking through the Garden of Gethsemani, in Kentucky, with Thomas Merton. Dad lived a faith-based life and treated everyone with kindness and respect. In keeping with Dad’s love of all, donations to LHSC Kidney Care Centre, World Vision or the charity of your choice would be appreciated."
