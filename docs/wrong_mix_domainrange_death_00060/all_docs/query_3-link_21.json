In 1969, Dr. Tilford was one of 100 African-American educators from across the country who received Ford Foundation Grants for advanced graduate study. He received his doctorate from Oklahoma State University in 1970. Dr. Tilford also had a bachelor's degree from Langston University in mathematics/chemistry and a master's degree from Johns Hopkins University in science education. He was appointed Dean of the Graduate School of WSU in 1988 and Associate Vice President for Academic Affairs in 1994. Dr. Tilford chaired many organizations, and his committee work showed his commitment to the education of students traditionally underrepresented at the university level. In the 1970s, he served on a committee that developed a successful proposal for the minority studies program. Also, he helped conduct a study of the institutional commitment to minorities at WSU."
