        "text": "Presentation Title:\n\nThe Critics of Critical Race Theory: Using pluralist theory to find Geppetto's strings\n\nPresenter\n\nDr. Obe Lee Jones\n\nWestern Governors University\n\nPresentation Theme:\n\nBlack history and anti-racist teaching are under attack. The public face of this attack has the twisted nose and cockeyes of those who criticize Critical Race Theory. As of February 2022, 36 states have introduced over one hundred bills to punish educators who would teach about racism, gender equity, and systemic discrimination. These bills would make teachers wear cameras and microphones, set up tip lines to allow parents to snitch on teachers, and sue school districts. These bills have already led to teachers receiving physical death threats at their homes and professional death threats in the form of de-licensure. In the face of this attack, we must remember to think systematically to clearly identify the groups attacking anti-racist education and then plan to protect it.\n\nThe paper has four related goals. First, I detail the nature of the attack. Secondly, I will explain the main assumptions of Critical Race Theory. Third, I castrate the talking points against Critical Race Theory. Lastly, I examine the people and groups making this attack while revealing their corporate sponsors. By the end of the presentation, the listener should be armed with talking points to defend the teaching of black history and support an anti-racist pedagogy. Carter G. Woodson would have no less of us.\n\nAbout Dr. Jones\n\nDr. Obe Lee Jones was raised in Brooklyn, NY and resides in Atlanta, GA, took his Bachelor of Arts degree from Morehouse College and took both his M.A and PhD from Clark Atlanta University in political science. Dr. Jones is married and has two children. His research areas include African American political thought, comparative politics, and American government. Dr. Jones has taught undergraduate courses continuously since 1998 and is a full- time faculty member at Western Governors University while also teaching at Clark Atlanta University and Kennesaw State University.\n\nOver the years, Dr. Jones has taught political science classes at Morris Brown College, Spelman College, Morehouse College, and Atlanta Metropolitan College. Dr. Jones has presented papers to fellow faculty around American Elections, the U.S. Constitution and elements of African American political thought and has won teaching awards. Most recently Dr. Jones has co-published an article on recent research surrounding the use of poetry to teach about politics and race and the manuscript under construction uses world systems theory to compare the civil wars of Angola and Ethiopia.\n\nWelcome to Henry Ford College! After hosting two successful conferences, we are extremely proud to host the third statewide Black Male Retention and Success Conference on our campus.\n\nThe conference was created by Dr. Kalvin DaRonne Harvell, sociology faculty member and leader of the Black Male and QUEENS Focus Group (BMQFG). In addition to Dr. Harvell, Mr. Chardin Claybourne, Faculty Director of the Learning Lab and Tutoring Services, has been instrumental in his leadership to the success of the BMQFG and this conference. This group has consistently demonstrated the Henry Ford College mission of “transforming lives and building better futures” for African American men and women. And that transformation extends well beyond our campuses. The students influenced by this group will go on to become leaders across every industry and field. They will be innovators in their communities, and in civic and service roles around the world. They will make this College proud.\n\nI know Dr. Harvell personally, and if you have not met him, you are in for a treat. One of the most valuable aspects of his work is that it comes from a place of abundance and access. In serving underrepresented minorities, Dr. Harvell sets the highest standards for hard work and success. He is able to translate rigorous academic study and sociological insight into action-based goals and positive outcomes.\n\nDr. Harvell and his students do not settle for a modest level of success. They want to excel in and beyond the classroom. They don’t demand excellence, they inspire it. They understand that access, support, and equity are keys to leveling the field for everyone.\n\nDuring this conference, I hope all of you will find like-minded colleagues who aspire to similar goals and who can share their initiatives and metrics for success, as well as the challenges they face. I am excited about Dr. Harvell's vision of a state-wide network dedicated to the promotion of Black students’ academic and career success. Hopefully, you will join in that effort.\n\nOur Black students deserve our best. They are worthy of every effort to meet them where they are, to challenge, encourage, and support them in reaching the life-transforming excellence that shows their highest capabilities.\n\nThe conference theme is “Resilience During Uncertainty: Succeeding Despite Challenges.” All of us at Henry Ford College eagerly join with you in carrying this work forward. Thank you for attending the conference. I hope you find it inspiring, informative, and energizing.\n\nBest wishes,\n\nRussell A. Kavalhuna, J.D.\n\nPresident\n\nHenry Ford College\n\nDear Colleagues, Students, and Friends,\n\nIt is both a pleasure and a privilege to welcome you to Henry Ford College for its hosting of the Third Annual Black Male Retention and Success Conference. From the very start, I wish to recognize and applaud the efforts of the many speakers, scholars, staff, and students who have made this exciting and essential event possible – most especially, Dr. Kalvin DaRonne Harvell, Prof. of Sociology and Coordinator of the Black Male and QUEENS Focus Group at HFC, Mr. Chardin Claybourne, Faculty Director of HFC’s Learning Lab and Tutoring Services Department, and Dr. Courtney Matthews, Prof. of English. With them, I invite you to join in the courageous conversations that will undoubtedly emerge throughout the conference, to share your own expertise and experience with others, and to participate actively in the collaborative and compelling work of creating successful and promising tomorrows for all our black male learners.\n\nIt is hard to believe that 10 years have passed since the Center for Community College Student Engagement released its eye-opening study regarding the aspirations and achievements of men of color in America’s two-year colleges (2012 CCCSE Cohort Data, published in 2014 as Aspirations to Achievement: Men of Color and Community Colleges.) I still recall my surprise when learning that of black male students enrolled in community colleges in 2011-12: 59% indicated an interest in completing a certificate (compared to 50% of white male students who shared the same goal); 87% hoped to earn an associate degree (an aspiration shared by 80% of white male students); and, 82% intended to transfer to a four-year institution to pursue even more advanced education and academic credentials (something that only 72% of their white counterparts hoped to achieve). It was plain and obvious – black male students had high aspirations, set healthy goals, and dreamed of academic success. But, according to the IPEDS data for this same time period, only a staggeringly low 5% of black male students actually earned their certificates or associate degrees within three years of enrolling in community college, while at least 32% of their white male peers completed their credentials.\n\nI wish I could joyfully proclaim that such unwarranted and unacceptable achievement and equity gaps have long since been closed over these past 10 years – however, as your own presence at this conference underscores and attests, we have many more miles yet to travel together on this journey to ensure that ALL learners have the support that they both need and deserve to realize their aspirations and achieve their educational and career goals. In this, we must cease in our chagrin that students are not “college-ready” and truly strive instead to become “student-ready” colleges. We must realize that students care less about “how much we know” and want rather to “know more how much we care.” We must make a radical shift from being a “transactional” system based on policies and practices that students must somehow divine and navigate to becoming a “relational” environment centered on belonging, inclusion, diversity, and equity. And, we must “learn by listening” – really hearing what students have to say about the importance of personal connections, meaningful engagement, high expectations, relevant coursework, and the quality of instruction as they impact their own academic success. Failure in these efforts cannot be an option as the stakes are both steep and real for our students, for our learning communities, and for our nation.\n\nThank you for your unwavering commitment to student success and the progress that I know you will make together on this important and ongoing journey!\n\nSincerely,\n\nMichael A. Nealon\n\nVice President of Academic Affairs\n\nHenry Ford College\n\nDr. Courtney Aleise Matthews\n\nDr. Courtney Aleise Matthews is a Florida native and alum of the HBCU, Florida A&M University. Matthews has been an English professor for the last 13 years. In addition to teaching, she has also worked with students as an academic advisor, writing center tutor and writing center director. After earning her Bachelor’s in Journalism and English from FAMU, Matthews went on to earn a Masters in English Literature from the University of Toledo. There she started her teaching career in 2009. From Toledo, Ohio Matthews moved to Hawaii where she was a professor, a paralegal at a top law firm and earned another degree. While in Hawaii, Matthews earned a Masters in Linguistics, with a focus on endangered languages and language revitalization, from the University of Hawaii at Manoa. In line with this work, Matthews won the Linguistic Endowment fund which she used to create and distribute a book in Hawaiian and English (Hawaiian language revitalization materials) to schools under Keiki O Ka ‘Aina. Matthews has also earned a certificate from the Harvard Graduate School of Education, Including Ourselves in the Change Equation: Personal Learning for Organizational Performance. Given her student centered focus, Matthews has also earned a Doctorate in Applied Learning Sciences from the University of Miami, with a focus on how Writing Centers can help college students transfer knowledge and writing skills across the curriculum and into their careers.\n\nWith a passion for student success and introducing students to new opportunities, Matthews has visited over 30 countries, including taking groups of students on study abroad trips from hiking the Great Wall of China, to a historical tour of India from Delhi to Agra and Kochi, to building a school in Ghana with Pencils of Promise. Dr. Matthews has also been a faculty judge and speaker at the Youth Innovative Conference on Global Governance (YICGG) where she helped to prepare and coach groups of students working on projects from sustainable development (2016 in Shanghai, China) to future energy and sustainable infrastructure (2017 in Astana, Kazahstan) and on global water preservation, utilization and development (2019 in Jakarta, Indonesia).\n\nDr. Matthews is also an artist and encourages students to look at intersections between art and social justice. While her own art focuses on exploring the world through landscape and cityscape travel photography, when teaching in Miami and New York City Matthews took students to engage with art exhibits and to meet artists whose works speak to current issues of social justice, as a way to bring present day into the writing classroom. Throughout her career thus far, Dr. Matthews has always been student focused, from creating a group for international students when teaching at the University of Miami to founding a group for first generation college students when teaching in New York City. These previous experiences and passions led Dr. Matthews to get involved with Henry Ford College’s Black Male and Queens Focus Group since moving to Michigan in 2021."
