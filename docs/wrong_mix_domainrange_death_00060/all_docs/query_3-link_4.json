In doing this, I desire to express my grateful sense of your many acts of real friendship towards my husband, and also of the kind remembrance you have of him: the more valued as when alive he held no one in higher respect and regard than yourself.\n\nThe book pretends to no other merit than that of being a plain, unexaggerated account of the sad events which came immediately under my own eye, and are only a sample of what happened wherever the mutiny prevailed in India.\n\nYour kind interest in my husband induces me to hope, that the history of his fate will not be a matter of indifference to you.\n\nI beg to remain, dear Dr. Philpott,\n\nYours most faithfully and respectfully,\n\nR. M. COOPLAND.\n\nPREFACE.\n\nTHOUGH the interest in India, which a short time since was so deep and absorbing, has lost its thrilling excitement for some, and its bitter suspense for others, and, though it may be thought presumptuous to add another book to the many already written, there may still be those who will be interested in learning further details of life in India during the Mutinies: first, how our peaceful calm was threatened; then how, in one short hour, many were bereft of all that made life dear, and the struggle that followed to hold and sustain that life when stript of all earthly joy and hope. India may yet hold a place in the thoughts of some, as the last home and resting-place of many near and dear to them.\n\nIn this simple narrative I have, of course, confined myself strictly to scenes and occurrences that have fallen under my own eye; many of which, as far as I am aware, have not hitherto found a narrator. It seems to amount almost to a duty, in the present unformed state of public opinion, that those who have been so unfortunate as to bear a part in the painful scenes in India should faithfully describe what they have themselves seen, leaving it to the public to draw their own conclusions.\n\nBy some my judgment of the natives of India may be deemed harsh; but I had little time to know them favourably, and have suffered too deeply from them, perhaps, to be a lenient and impartial judge. To me their character is a sealed book, beyond the sanguinary page which was the only one opened to me.\n\nThe Indian Mutiny we must all regard as one of God's heaviest and most awful judgments. Its cause, as yet, remains a mystery; but we will trust that out of such a fearful calamity, good will arise, but years must elapse ere we can look for it. The next generation of India may be redeemed: the present is too far gone.\n\nMay the coming year of 1859 bring success to our arms in India; may peace be established there, and under the rule of our gracious Sovereign, may our Empire there be founded on a surer basis, and Christianity be spread throughout the land.\n\nR.

The usual bustle and excitement, consequent on the arrival of an overland steamer, ensued. We all gathered on deck to view the rapidly approaching land. Some, who were returning to homes and relations, welcomed this country of their adoption as an old friend. Others, like myself, examined with a critical eye the new and strange land which they believed would be their home for many years. At last we anchored, and the friends who had been impatiently waiting on shore put off to the vessel. Some of the meetings must have been very trying; children in anxious suspense to see their parents after long years of separation, and parents in like anxiety to claim their children. A friend of mine told me he once overheard two fine fashionable-looking girls, just come from some great school, say to one another, on seeing a boat approaching the ship, containing two yellow-looking, ordinary people, \"Who are those old quizzes? what an antediluvian couple!\" when, to their horror and dismay, the despised couple claimed the gay young ladies as their own children. I heard many such tales of former days, when India was not so easy of access: but now, in these times of weekly intercourse, when boys and girls go backwards and forwards for their holidays, and when it is merely a pleasant trip to see the \"City of Palaces,\" the snow-capped Himalayas, or the romantic beauties of Cashmere, such things never happen.\n\nMy husband's brother-in-law now appeared, to our surprise, as we did not know he had arrived a fortnight before. At the same time, we were informed by a servant from the boarding-house, where we had engaged rooms, that a carriage was waiting for us; so without delay we bade adieu to our numerous friends, many of whom we were never again to meet, and getting into the boat, were soon on shore, and driving rapidly through the native part of Calcutta. I was much pleased with my first sight of the grand Fort, the Cathedral, the fine row of houses on Chowringhee-road, which is the \"Belgravia\" of Calcutta, the Maidân, or \"Hyde-park,\" and the imposing-looking Government House, whose lofty dome was surmounted by some adjutants (birds) looking down on what was passing below, with grave, attentive dignity. But it is not my intention to give more than a slight description of Calcutta; I was there only five weeks, and abler writers than myself have so often described it, that Calcutta is better known to the generality of people in England than Paris or Rome. There is scarcely a family in the three kingdoms that has not some friend or relative in India, and who has not sent home an account of Calcutta, its splendid mansions, its balls, races, and the luxurious life of its inhabitants.\n\nWe arrived before long at our destination, Miss Wright's boarding-house, one of the quietest and best conducted establishments of the kind. We much preferred it to the confusion of a great hotel: my husband too had been there before. Miss Wright we found a most pleasant and attentive hostess. Our large airy room reminded me of some in the German hotels. After the luxury of a bath, we waited for dinner in the drawing-room, which only differed from an English one in the quantity of its lights. By this time the room was filled with hungry people, ready for dinner, an agreeable mixture of civil and military, but no ladies. A native appeared with meekly folded hands, and in a sedate voice said, \"Khana mez pur hi\" (Dinner is on the table). We then proceeded to the dining-room, which we had only been separated from by silken curtains. The table was surrounded by native servants, gaily attired in their winter clothing, of different coloured cloth. I only noticed a few odd things; one was the want of decanters: the black bottles were clothed in pretty netted covers, and the tumblers had small silver covers to keep out the insects. I remember sitting next to a poor young officer, who gave me an account of fever, ague, and other Indian drawbacks; he looked dreadfully ill, and was on the eve of embarking for England.\n\nThe next morning my husband went to call on the Bishop, and report his arrival; and also to hire a buggy for our morning and evening drives. I, in the mean time, was employed in selecting an ayah, 1 a difficult task, as I knew next to nothing of the language; but Miss Wright kindly helped me, and selected a clean-looking woman, who had the best chits (written character). I was very much astonished to see the number of servants we required, even in a lodging-house – a kitmutghar, 2 an ayah, 1 a bearer, a dhoby, 3 and a dirzie. 4 After tiffin we dressed for our evening drive. The carriages and horses were equal to those seen daily in Hyde-park, and the ladies were most exquisitely dressed. Dresses from Paris arrive every fortnight, and the climate only requires a very airy style. We drove down Chowringhee-road, and on to the Maidân, or public esplanade, which extends several miles, round Fort William, and along the banks of the river. Many dangerous accidents happen here during the year. One morning I saw a beautiful horse lying on the road, with its leg broken, and a lady whom I knew had two horses killed in one year. Sailors, when they get a holiday, invariably spend it in driving about recklessly in a wretched hired buggy with tumble-down horse in the midst of the splendid equipages, and as they are often intoxicated, accidents of course follow. I was told that a sailor made the following excuse the day after one of these accidents:– \"I saw two lights ahead, and steered straight between them.\" Calcutta was not then lighted up after dark with gas, so there was an order for all the carriages, at a certain hour, to carry lamps. The aspect of the river was very interesting: it was crowded with vessels of all nations, from the well-built English and American frigates and steamers, to the picturesque craft from the Persian Gulf, and the queer Arab boats, with their strange, wild-looking crews and gay flags. The scene was more striking here than in London, or any English port, on account of there being nothing to take off your attention.\n\nA Calcutta \"turn out\" deserves a description. The carriage is like any London one, but the pair of glossy, graceful Arabs are worth looking at: they are stud horses, with the stud mark branded on their flanks, and though rather small, make up for it by their grace. The coachman is a stately individual, in a white dress, and gay cummerbund, 5 made of two different coloured bands, twisted together. The turban is not, as we fancy, simply a piece of muslin wound round the head, but is regularly made up, turban fashion; and obliquely across it is a corresponding band, with the master's crest in silver, like the thistle on a Scotch cap. The European children were all assembled in the Auckland, or as they were often called, the \"gardens of Eden,\" the Miss Edens having planned them: poor little things! they looked pale and sickly, and sadly overdone with grandeur. Fancy a tiny child, gaily dressed in the Highland costume, followed by an ayah, and preceded by a syce, 6 leading his diminutive steed, and a bearer 7 holding a large white umbrella, and two chuprassees. 8\n\nAfter driving for a couple of hours we returned to dinner.\n\nI will describe how each day passes in Calcutta.\n\nWe rise at daybreak, half-past five; the morning is heralded by the cawing of myriads of crows, the sharp squealing of kites, and the twittering of sparrows: very different from the awakening in a quiet country-house in England; and instead of thinking and indulging for an extra half hour, we start up, hurry over our bath and dressing, and then go out for a drive of an hour: and woe betide your head if you remain out too long without the buggy hood up. We then loiter as long as we dare in the garden; return in and partake of chota hazerie, bread and butter and tea; bathe, and dress for breakfast at 9 o'clock: after that, most ladies occupy themselves with their households and children. My husband went out to the shops to buy things for our journey up the country.\n\nAt twelve, a dead calm falls on the whole city. The delicate European lady in her lofty chamber, the poor coolie with his head wrapped in his turban, and curled up in some corner, or basking in the sun, even the animals, are alike slumbering. At two there is tiffin; we read and amuse ourselves till five, when we again drive out, dine at seven, and retire to bed at ten. But the gay inhabitants of Calcutta don't keep such early hours: the cool time of the year is their \"season,\" when they keep as late hours as \"Londoners.\"\n\nThe houses in Calcutta are very fine ones, from fifty to sixty feet high; many of the rooms are forty feet long, and very lofty. The white chunam, 9 contrasted with the green verandahs, has a dazzling effect. The floors are made of white chunam, and carpeted with light, pretty matting. Many of the entrance halls and dining-rooms are paved with marble. I was much struck with the number of outside staircases, or ladders, for the natives to reach the upper stories without going through the house.\n\nOur room opened into a pretty garden, where we often walked, and the old gardener used regularly to give me a nosegay every morning.\n\nMy husband went one morning to a large clerical breakfast at the palace, and returned with a kind invitation from the Bishop for me to breakfast there. So, on the appointed day, we drove to the palace; a large well-built house. The Bishop was very kind and friendly in his manner, and talked much about England, and some friends of his whom I knew. We then went into the chapel, a small room, filled with benches, where the Bishop read the Psalms for the day, and a long extemporaneous prayer. At breakfast the Bishop told my husband the station he was to be appointed to was Gwalior, which both he and Dr. Pratt seemed to consider a very good one. The Bishop then turned to me, and said, \"I have given your husband this station, which is a very desirable one, as he suffered so much in Burmah.\" After breakfast he asked us to stay in the palace, but as we had engaged our rooms for some time at Miss Wright's, we refused his kind invitation.\n\nWe often went out to the shops to buy things we should require at Gwalior. Some of the bookshops were very tempting, with all the new publications lying on marble tables, and the rooms so cool and dark that it was quite a treat to rest in them after the dusty, glaring streets; but it was very dangerous to linger long, as the books were double the price they are in England. I was very much amused with the Exchange, a large place, where everything is sold; the shopmen here are natives, but they speak English very well. I know 5l. seemed to go no further than 1l. in England, everything was so dear. I now felt what a pleasure it was to receive letters from home, and often solaced my home-sickness, or, as the Germans more poetically call it, \"Heimweh,\" by the \"sweet singing nightingales of the pen of correspondence.\"\n\nA steamer arriving, the fresh influx of people crowded every hotel and lodging-house to overflowing. My uncle, Colonel Stuart Menteath, his wife and daughters, arrived. They had to stay a day or two on board before they could get rooms, and then they could only get unfinished ones at Wilson's, up a steep flight of stairs. I went to see them, and the confusion was tremendous. Part of the house was a large shop, where everything could be got, from a wedding trousseau downwards. One morning we went with Colonel Goodwin to see a school he had established to teach the natives modelling. Some of the models were wonderful. When they did them very well they were allowed to sell them. Colonel Goodwin gave me one or two: I remember one was a model of a little mouse.\n\nMy husband's bearer was a perfect specimen of a \"mild Hindoo\" (so much raved about at home). He was lithe and slender, with beautifully formed hands and feet, clear olive skin, well-cut features, and white, regular teeth. His movements were most graceful and refined, and he was most particular in the fashion of his dress.\n\nWe asked some friends what sort of a place Gwalior was, and found it was not under the Government, being in the Mahratta states of Gwalior and Indore; the rajahs of which are each bound by treaty to maintain a body of troops, officered from the Company's army, and under the sole orders of the British Residents at their respective courts. Scindiah's Contingent consists of five corps of artillery, with thirty guns, two regiments of cavalry, seven of infantry, in all about 7,300 men. This Contingent was called into the field during the disturbances in Bundlecund, and did very good service. A good description of Gwalior will be found in \"Blackwood\" for 1844; and for a panegyric on the sepoys, people must read Alison's \"History of Europe,\" vol. x., page 370. We were told Gwalior was considered, though very hot, a healthy station, and the society there very pleasant; for, being a Contingency, the officers and their families did not change so often as at other stations.\n\nWe missed, in the flat country, the graceful undulations and hill and dale of our own home scenery. There is no hill which you may ascend and have a good prospect of the surrounding country: you cannot see beyond the flat, dirty-looking plain, and your eye soon wearies of the extensive cotton fields, only varied by miserable native villages, with stagnant pools and open drains. We had often to turn back when attempting to pass through some of these villages, the dense feeling of the air and smell of malaria making it unpleasant to proceed. I was sorry we could not see Barrackpore, my relatives who had formerly been there having left, for I heard the park and Governor-General's country residence were very fine. Lord and Lady Canning seemed to prefer this residence, as they only occasionally came into Calcutta for a state dinner, &c. Many of the Calcutta people spend their Sundays at Barrackpore.\n\nThe gentlemen at our boarding-house often spent their evenings at the opera or other public places of amusement. The opera-house is an odd-looking building, built of bamboos, and thatched.\n\nWe often used to watch the cricket-matches on the Maidân. Cricket and races seemed the principal amusements of Calcutta. The natives, whose only amusements are sleeping, smoking, or watching the dance of the Nâtch girls, 10 who soothe them to sleep by the tinkling of their ornaments and their languid movements, must have laughed at our toil after pleasure.\n\nWe went one day to see the Mint, and were fully initiated into the merits of gold mohurs, rupees, and annas, by Dr. Boycott, the assay master, to whom we had an introduction. I thought the device on the gold mohurs very pretty – a lion standing near a palm-tree; though the former seemed rather out of proportion. Many ladies make bracelets by stringing these coins together; and they often have ornaments made of rupees melted down: one rupee will make a thimble. The effect of the nearly nude black figures of the natives flitting about in the darkness, dimly lighted by the forge fires, was very unearthly.\n\nWe spent another day very pleasantly at the Bishop's College, founded by the Society for the Propagation of the Gospel, with Dr. Kay, whose society we much enjoyed; he was very clever and agreeable, and my husband had met him before. We walked in the evening of the same day to the Botanical Gardens, in which I was rather disappointed, having formed my ideas of tropical plants and gardens from the splendid conservatory at Chatsworth.\n\nWe now began to make preparations for our departure from Calcutta. We bought a grand piano, a buggy, and stores of glass, &c., and then \"laid our dâk,\" 11 which is necessary in order to have relays of horses. The great number of people who were on their way up to the North-west Provinces made it necessary to bespeak a dâk carriage. Some ten years ago, when people travelled up in palanquins, they used to have relays of bearers at every stage, and arrangements made. The money is always paid beforehand. I think our journey altogether up the country cost us between 50l. and 60l. We could only go as far as Agra by dâk carriage; from thence to Gwalior we were to proceed in the old way by bearers' dâk. We then hired a kitmutghar; but I could not hear of an ayah who would leave Calcutta. We bought a mattress, pillows, lamps, and blankets, to fit up our gharry, 12 as we were told not to depend on the supplies of the dâk bungalows. We then sent all our boxes, except two portmanteaus, by bullock train, as we are only allowed to take a certain weight of luggage on the gharry.\n\nI was much amused at the way the Calcutta people spoke of our going up the country; they considered it banishment. Many of them had never been beyond Barrackpore or Dum-Dum.\n\nWe had an invitation to a ball at Dum-Dum, to which my aunt and cousins went, and also one to Government House; but we could not stay, as all our arrangements were made, and our boxes sent off. I was very much disappointed at not seeing Government House, as I had heard so much of it, a relation of my father's having been Governor-General.\n\nI went to say good-bye to my aunt and cousins – my uncle had just left for Mooltan; they were not going to Simla till after Christmas, which is always a gay time in Calcutta. The indigo merchants and other grand people flock in from the country to enjoy the gaieties, and every one buys presents. Wilson's shop, which is brilliantly lighted up and decorated, is a great resort for buying Christmas gifts. My aunt told me she had written to her sister, Mrs. Douglas Campbell, who was at Gwalior – as her husband, Captain Campbell of the Engineers, was superintending the completion of the road from Agra to Indore, through Gwalior – to ask her to receive us, till we could get a house of our own. I was very glad to hear we should have such a friend at Gwalior, as I had often heard of Mrs. Campbell.\n\nWe left Calcutta on the 21st of December. Altogether I did not think Calcutta looked much like the capital of a country called \"The Queen's penal settlement for paupers.\"\n\nWe were anxious to reach Benares by Christmas-day, which we wished to spend with my husband's sister and brother-in-law, who had left Calcutta soon after our arrival.\n\nCHAPTER II.\n\nTHE MOFUSSIL.\n\nWE started in a palki gharry 13 for the ferry, which we crossed in a small steamer, crowded with people going to the railway station – some, like ourselves, beginning their journey – and hosts of natives. We saw floating down the river many bodies of dead natives, all in that state described in the song of the \"White Lady of Avenel,\" which so terrified the poor Sacristan; only a crow instead of a pike was diligently picking at the fishy, horrid-looking eyes of the dead bodies. The river was crowded with different vessels.\n\nI was quite pleased on arriving at the railway station to see again the engine with its long row of carriages. My husband here met some friends of his, a young officer and his wife, who had been his fellow passengers to England the year before by the \"overland route.\" They had just returned by the Cape, and were on their way to their station. I now saw, for the first time, some elephants; for they are not allowed to come into Calcutta, as they frighten the horses. The railway carriages were very comfortable, and quite luxurious in their fittings up; you could draw out a board between the seats, and so recline: very different from the narrow, closely-packed carriages in England. We enjoyed ourselves very much talking to our friends. My husband talked to Captain F— and I to his wife: she was very pretty and engaging, and I found her conversation most agreeable. She talked all about Indian society, and seemed to prefer it to what she called the \"cold, formal English manners!\" She also gave me a great many friendly hints about travelling and station life. About six months afterwards I saw her name in the long list of Cawnpore victims.\n\nWe passed many small stations; at one we got out, and had some refreshments. If it had not been for the view from the windows, I could have fancied myself travelling from London to York.\n\nAbout five in the evening we reached Raneegunge, 121 miles on our journey, and there bade adieu to all comfortable travelling; not without a strong wish that they would soon continue the railway on to Agra, and so facilitate travelling, and make India as much like home as possible. No one can imagine the benefit it will be when India is traversed by this gigantic system of communication. The hotel was a few yards from the railway station; before it stood several dâk gharries, and a travelling carriage belonging to some officer, who preferred travelling in it to a dâk gharry.\n\nAfter a bath and dinner, we all commenced packing our gharries. I was much amused to see how our friends packed theirs; they were \"up to\" all manner of travelling \"dodges,\" and very kindly helped us to arrange our small quarters, where we were to pass the night. At last we all started: about six gharries, one full of young officers who seemed to enjoy the fun.\n\nI never saw our kind friends again; they reached Agra before us. Captain F— went on to the Punjaub, and his wife first went to stay with some friends at Delhi, and then at Cawnpore, so her poor husband was in uncertainty as to her fate for months. When he at last heard the dreadful news it nearly killed him.\n\nThe drivers began to blow their shrill horns, and make the night echo to their wild music. The horses went a tremendous pace at first, but soon relaxed their speed, and required incessant flogging. We changed horses every six miles, and it was rather annoying to be awakened out of a sound sleep by the process of changing. The horses are very troublesome: at times they will rear, kick, plunge, back, and go through a series of gymnastics by no means agreeable to the occupants of the carriage, and disturbing all their little arrangements.\n\nThe next morning we stopped and breakfasted at a dâk bungalow. These bungalows have been so often described, that I will only say the first I saw struck me as being very dreary and desolate: near it were two tombstones erected to the memory of two unfortunate travellers, who had, I believe, died of cholera. Our route now lay through a rather more picturesque country. It was very dull work, however, as we could not read on account of the jolting; we did try to make up a few Hindoostanee sentences with the aid of a dictionary, but it was very puzzling: my husband knew very little of the language, as Hindoostanee is not spoken in Burmah, and he had a Portuguese servant there. I always felt inclined to speak to the natives in German or French.\n\nAbout midnight on the second night we met with an unpleasant accident. When we were both fast asleep we were suddenly awakened by the sensation of falling from a height, which was followed by a roll over and tremendous crash. Then came sundry ominous bangs, caused by the horse's kicking, and the wails of natives. We, after some difficulty, opened the door, and extricated ourselves, and I mounted the bank we had fallen down, with my husband's help, as it was very steep. It was bitterly cold, and my husband threw up to me some wraps to cover myself with, whilst he picked up the kitmutghar, who lay groaning on the ground, declaring his leg was broken; he had really hurt himself, having fallen from the top, where he had sat amongst the boxes. We found out that the cause of the accident was the driver having fallen asleep over his hookah. 14 We then both set to work to scold him in Hindoostanee, and not being sufficiently fluent in that, had recourse to English; which we had been told natives disliked more, as they did not know what it meant. What they consider the most opprobrious epithets in Hindoostanee are \"khala sour,\" \"hurrumzadu,\" and \"mourgeu\" (black pig, infidel, and fowl). The syce and driver began to shout and yell, which in about ten minutes brought a flock of coolies 15 from a neighbouring chowki; 16 and then began the process of dragging up the shattered carriage and horse (the latter being much hurt), and collecting our scattered goods, by the light of a single lantern which we had brought with us. The coolies afterwards dragged the carriage to the next chowki, where we got a fresh horse; further on, at Shergotty, we procured another gharry. Our adventure prevented us from breakfasting with Colonel Goodwin's son, near Shergotty; which was very provoking. We afterwards heard that the place of our accident was the haunt of tigers, being near a jungle. Some travellers had had their syce carried off by one the week before, and had been only disturbed by the poor creature's shrieks when it was too late to save him.\n\nI saw some awful specimens of eastern diseases – leprosy and elephantiasis – at Shergotty, as this place is a great resort for beggars, who extort alms from travellers passing by. They thronged round our gharry as we were changing horses, and showed off their hideous deformities. I tried to get rid of them by throwing out handfuls of pice, 17 but they only surrounded us the more.\n\nThe country beyond was very wild and desolate. The only civilized thing we saw was the telegraph wires, sometimes supported on high stone pillars, by which a message can be transmitted from Bombay to Calcutta in less than three-quarters of an hour. The natives have a great idea of its magical powers. The first thing they destroyed in the mutiny was the telegraph.\n\nWe had been warned not to trust to the commissariat of the dâk bungalows, so had brought with us a good supply of eatables – hunter's beef, biscuits, preserves, and one of Wilson's Christmas cakes; Miss Wright also had given us some mince-pies and other Christmas dainties. We eat our Christmas dinner at one of these bungalows, instead of at Benares, as we had intended. Our accident having made us nervous about travelling at night, we did not get on so fast, as we passed the nights at the bungalows. Such every-day matters as eating and drinking are of no consequence in England, where you can have as many meals as you like; but people travelling in a country not quite civilized, are obliged to attend to such matters. No one ought to travel in India without tea, sugar, a flask of brandy, quinine, and opium. I think the way dinner is got at a dâk bungalow is most ridiculous. As soon as you arrive, you hear the most lamentable cackling and screaming amongst the feathered tribe, and speedily an unfortunate fowl is caught, killed, plucked, and grilled for your dinner, and generally turns out to be some tough old grandfather.\n\nWe arrived at Benares on the morning, of the 26th. It was a beautiful morning, and the view down the Ganges very picturesque, with hosts of natives bathing in its sacred waters; its banks lined with mosques, steps, and ghâts. 18 We found our friends well, and already comfortably established in their new home. Their house, though not so grand as the Calcutta houses, which are rented at the rate of from 300l. to 600l. a year, was a very comfortable and elegant one, far surpassing many officers' bungalows, 19 though it was a missionary's. It was large, well built, comfortably furnished, and the verandah, supported on pillars, was surrounded by a pretty garden, in a large compound 20 where were two or three other missionaries' houses, equally comfortable and commodious.\n\nBenares is called the Oxford of India, as it is a great place for learning. There are no less than eighty schools in which Sanscrit alone is taught. It is more eastern in its appearance than many of the Indian cities; most of the streets are so narrow, an elephant can hardly pass through them. It is held in great veneration by the Hindoos, who call it the \"Holy City,\" and are constantly making pilgrimages to it, to bathe in the sacred waters of the Ganges. The Brahmins 21 (who occupy 8,000 houses) and the Brahmini bulls rule the rest of the inhabitants with an iron rod. One of these bulls may eat the gram, 22 exposed for sale in the streets, that belongs to some poor bunyan, 23 or enter a man's garden and devour his vegetables, and they dare not drive him away: they are even expected to feel highly honoured at the beasts condescending so far as to favour their property. These creatures are very pretty, with humps on their backs, and long dewlaps, and look sleek and fat; but many of them are very vicious, from being so petted and indulged: they keep the people in awe of the awkward poke of their horns.\n\nThe next morning my husband went with his brother-in-law into the city, to see all over the temples and other holy places; some he could not see, being too sacred. On his return, he gave me the usual account of the nonchalance of the overfed Brahmini bulls, who required a chuprassee to keep them from molesting people. In the evening my sister-in-law and I drove out, and our husbands rode. The road swarmed with sacred monkeys, who jumped about, and even leaped right over our carriage, till I expected every instant one would pop into it: their grave faces and odd antics were most absurd.\n\nAs we returned, we heard the most unmusical sounds, which proved to be the peculiar notes of the Brahmins' horn, issuing from all the temples where they were worshipping. Benares is a wide field for any number of active missionaries and zealous followers of Henry Martyn. I saw a native Christian, called Nehemiah, who was really a most gentlemanly and polished man; he had been all over England, Scotland, and some parts of the Continent, and spoke English perfectly. He had given up a large property to become a Christian, and lived in a small hut in the missionary compound. He was dressed in his native costume, and when he entered the room, took off his shoes. I thought that, now he was a Christian, he need not submit to such a degradation. He talked like a connoisseur of pictures and books, and, to my delight, said he preferred England to India. On Sunday we went to the station church, as the service in the church at the missionary compound was in Hindoostanee. My husband knew the chaplain, so we spent a few hours with him and his wife after service, and had tiffin.\n\nWe left for Agra on the 29th. We passed numbers of natives going to their work in the fields, all \"horrid with caste marks.\" The weather grew colder the further we advanced: they had fires at Benares, it was so cold.\n\nWe met a man carrying a large snake, apparently about two yards in length and ten inches in circumference, twined round his neck like a comforter. He wanted to sell us some stones for charms, but found a better customer in our kitmutghar. This man had complained dreadfully of the cold, and looked a most absurd figure, curled up, and rolled in his rezai 24 on the top of the gharry. He complained so much of his injured leg, that we got a doctor at Benares to look at it, who said it was only sprained; so we gave him some embrocation to rub it with. He made this leg a never-ending source of annoyance to us the whole way, making it a plea for excusing himself from his work.\n\nWe afterwards met a man leading two beautiful Persian cats, with splendid fan-like tails. He asked 2l. for each – rather too much for a cat; though at home he might have made a good market of them, where some old lady, with a cat-mania, might have found them a valuable addition to her collection.\n\nI have never described a dâk gharry. It is something like a small caravan on four wheels, and is drawn by one horse. There is a well inside, in which all the provisions and packages are placed, and at night you cover this well with a leather cushion or mattress, which serves for a bed; but it requires a great deal of preparation, and you are obliged to stop to get out to arrange it. The vehicle is lined with a strong, thick lining, and has capacious pockets and a shelf for books, biscuits, oranges, &c.\n\nWe reached the dâk bungalow at Allahabad in the evening. This is a favourite station; and is said now to be chosen for the seat of government, instead of Agra. It is well adapted for this; as, being situated on the Grand Trunk Road, at the junction of the Ganges and Jumna, 498 miles from Calcutta, 1,151 from Madras, and 831 from Bombay, its facilities for travelling and communication are many. Lying at the extremity of the Doab, 25 the country is fertile and well wooded; and, escaping the hot, scorching winds of the \"up country,\" it partakes more of the humid Bengal climate. The gardens look fresh and luxuriant, as it rains here when other parts of the country are parched up.\n\nAllahabad is the first station in the \"Upper Provinces;\" all to the eastward of it, being called \"down country.\" Troops are continually passing through in the cold season, which adds to the enlivenment of society at the station. We drove a long way by the side of the cemetery, which, with its lofty tombs of Asiatic architecture, looked very different from an English one: these closely crowded reminiscences of our poor countrymen, made me think that India was truly called \"Scotland's graveyard.\"\n\nOur drive, however, gave me much pleasure: the military cantonments 26 surrounded by trees, the grassy, park-like plain, the English-looking houses, and tastefully laid-out gardens, formed a picturesque scene. How little did I then think, that that pretty, homelike station, in a few short months, would be a scene of devastation and ruin.\n\nThe road from Allahabad to Cawnpore seemed to me the extreme of barrenness. We halted part of the day at Cawnpore, and dined at the hotel. I was much struck with the dreary, depressing look of the place, which seemed fitted for the cruel tragedies so soon to be enacted there. The cantonments extended six miles, in the middle of a sandy plain; and when I saw the long rows of blank-looking barracks, the neglected houses, surrounded by bare mud walls, so different from those of Allahabad, I felt thankful that our lot was not cast in such a dreary waste. We met many travellers on our way, and constantly English ladies and children unaccompanied by male Europeans.\n\nWe reached Agra January 3rd, and visited the Military Chaplain, to whom we had an introduction. He very kindly asked us to stay with him till we had made arrangements to proceed to Gwalior: for here the dâk gharry stopped, the road to Gwalior and Indore not being quite finished. I must here remark, that the Grand Trunk Road, when it is complete from Calcutta to the Affghan frontier, a distance of 1,500 miles, will be one of the best roads in the world.\n\nUnfortunately it rained heavily all that day, so we could not do anything. Rain generally falls after Christmas in India, cheering and refreshing everything, and making a pleasant change in the air.\n\nOn Saturday we commenced the troublesome and worrying business of buying furniture.\n\nIn India when any English officer leaves a station either to return home or remove to another, it is customary for him to sell all, or part, of his furniture, horses, and carriages; he makes a list of the articles and their prices, leaving a margin for the purchasers to write their names in against the article they have chosen. In this way we procured a large portion of our furniture; for the remainder, we ransacked the European and native shops. The native shopmen tease and torment you dreadfully, trying to pass off painted deal for real mahogany, and cotton for silk-velvet. One man, who was particularly imposing and cunning, afterwards made himself very active in the mutinies, firing on our troops, and inciting others on; but he met his richly deserved fate in a ditch near Delhi.\n\nIn the afternoon we drove to the celebrated Taj Mahal. The whole country we passed through looked so barren and wretched, that when we found ourselves in the midst of the lovely garden that surrounds the Taj, and saw before us, towering aloft into the clear blue sky, this wonderful pile of snow-white, glistening marble, contrasting with the solemn, dark green of the cypress and myrtle trees, our feelings of delight and surprise can hardly be described.\n\nThis stupendous edifice more than realized my expectations of eastern grandeur; and I thought no description in the \"Arabian Nights,\" of gorgeous palaces, exaggerated. One could scarcely fancy it built by mortal hands: it seemed as if it had been dropped from the skies, so exquisitely ethereal did it look – too sublime for this lower world.\n\nEntering through a gateway into a large court, round which ran a range of arcades, occupied by horses and their attendants, we alighted at a flight of steps, which we mounted, and passing through the massive brazen doors of a splendid vestibule, where some natives were waiting to conduct us round the Taj, we entered the garden.\n\nAnd now, picture to yourself – if you can realize such a scene – a long avenue bordered by sad-looking cypresses, fit emblems for the place where so much beauty and ambition repose; and at the end of this vista a vast platform of solid masonry, forty feet high, from which rises proudly to the heavens a structure of the clearest white marble, glittering and sparkling in the bright sun; four minarets, like sentries watching over this \"crown of edifices,\" and tipped with shining gold, like the dome and four cupolas surmounting the edifice. We ascended the steps leading to the terrace – which, with the Taj and four minarets, is entirely built of white marble – and lifted the curtain, that guards the sacred interior from the common gaze.\n\nAt first, the soft light streaming in from the \"clerestory\" windows, casting a hazy indistinctness over everything, prevented us from clearly defining objects; but gradually the interior became more distinct, and we saw, round the octagonal-shaped centre hall, small cells, like side chapels in a cathedral. We descended into the vault, where are the tombs of the Emperor Shah Jehan and his queen, Mumlazi Mahal Begum, who lie side by side. Immediately above, under the dome, are the cenotaphs, enclosed by a marble screen, which is carved in the finest fret-work, like lace, and said to be unrivalled. The cenotaphs are inlaid with costly mosaics, of wreaths of flowers formed by precious stones of cornelian, jasper, agate, and lapislazuli , the shading being so delicately and elaborately finished, that a single flower is often composed of several dozen stones; and also with sentences from the Koran in black letters.\n\nThe walls are panelled and inlaid with mosaics of the same description, only the patterns are larger, and the arabesque designs more profuse; but I should be wearisome were I to dwell long on each separate beauty. After spending some time in alternately examining these wonders, and reflecting on the time (200 years) this building had lasted, and which still showed so few signs of age, we went to the back of the Taj to see the remains of a bridge which Shah Jehan had commenced building, of white marble, to connect this Taj with another intended for himself, when his imprisonment and death cut short this grand design.\n\nWe saw the Fort in the distance, at a bend in the river.\n\nWe strolled in the gardens till late in the evening. They are kept up by Government, and beautifully laid out in groves and alleys of peach and orange-trees, intersected by walks of white marble and freestone, and borders formed in patterns of stone work, and adorned with fountains. Down the centre of the principal avenue runs a marble channel, with jets d'eau.\n\nWe sat on the marble steps watching the gathering darkness stealing on, and the fairy-like Taj glimmering from amongst long shadows of the trees; and enjoying the soft, balmy air, like an autumnal evening at home, the scent of the orange and myrtle, and other tropical flowers, which, like all eastern fragrance, is so redolent of luxury and magnificence; brilliant green parrots were flitting about, or bathing in the channel, vying in brightness with the gold and silver fish; and we remained listening to the liquid, murmuring coo of the doves, and the twittering of the humming-birds.\n\nOn Sunday we went to the military cantonment church, where my husband preached both morning and afternoon. On Monday we looked over the Fort: and little did I then think how I should again see it, alone, and under what circumstances. In the evening we dined with the brigade-major.\n\nMr. French was out on a missionary tour, so that I could not see him, much as I should have liked it.\n\nWe drove round the camp of the Commander-in-Chief, who was on his way up the country. His wife and daughter had accompanied him so far, and stopped to see the Taj before proceeding to England. This, my first sight of the pomp and pageantry of war, was very novel and interesting. The tents were pitched on the parade ground, in rows like streets, the sentries at their fronts, and the horses picquetted about. Aides-de-camps were riding about with orders, some men were cooking their supper over the fires, some unloading the growling camels, and others preparing the tents for the night and cleaning their accoutrements; the huge elephants were consuming their vast heaps of fodder before them, the goats being milked and fowls killed: altogether, it was a stirring scene. The \"course\" that night was crowded with carriages and equestrians; and when we went again to see the Taj, its silent, solemn repose was sadly marred by the loud laughter and comic songs of light-hearted people trying the echo.\n\nCaptain Garston, an officer on the Commander-in-Chief's staff, and his wife, spent the day with Mr. Hind. Mrs. Garston gave me a most amusing account of the march. She and her children had a large carriage, called a palkee gharry (something like the dâk gharry which I have described, only more comfortable), drawn by a splendid pair of bullocks. These animals are most useful for draught and agricultural purposes; they stand about fourteen or fifteen hands high, and are not to be surpassed in size and sleekness; many of them have queerly twisted and curved horns, which are sometimes painted red. This lady had many camels to carry her furniture, and enjoyed moving about very much; the only trouble, she said, was the early getting up, as they usually march from two in the morning till the sun rises: but sometimes they continue again in the evening. Forced marches are, however, very trying; many of the soldiers die of apoplexy and cholera.\n\nMiss W— arrived at the Hinds, on her way to join her brother, a judge, who was on his rounds in his district; and she went out to the shops to see the new Parisian fashions. On Tuesday we drove to the civil cantonments, which were some distance off. They also had a church and chaplain. Agra is the principal civil station in this part of India; it is, like Delhi, situated on the right bank of the Jumna, and is 800 miles from Calcutta and 150 from Delhi. The native city is very large, containing an enormous number of inhabitants; it has been in our possession since the year 1803, and was the head-quarters of Government in the North-west. The then Lieutenant-Governor, Mr. Colvin, resided in the Government House.\n\nWe saw the beautiful Roman Catholic Cathedral, which quite put to shame our station churches; and I was told the singing and service were most beautifully done, and much pains taken with them.\n\nThe Roman Catholics here have a bishop, a sisterhood, and a school, for both European and native children.\n\nI thought the houses and gardens much better and prettier than those of the military cantonments, more like the Calcutta houses, with their flat roofs, and built of stone.\n\nThe civilians here have very high pay, from 2,000l. to 5,000l. a year; and many of them go to the Hills in the hot season: those who cannot afford to send their children to England, send them there also, where there are schools. I frequently met people who had never been out of India. It is much hotter at Gwalior and Agra in the hot season, and colder in the cold season, than any other part of India, except the Punjaub. Peshawur is the hottest place in the north of India: I was told that residents there dug holes under their tables and sat in them, as the English did at Thyat Myo, in Burmah, where my husband was for a short time; and where they used to dig deep pits, and retire to them in the heat of the day. There is a bad kind of fever at Peshawur, from which my cousin, in the 70th Queen's, suffered much when he was there. This fever, with apoplexy, causes so much mortality that the place is called the \"Grave of the English.\"\n\nWe left for Gwalior on the 7th of January, and though I was wrapped in a cloth jacket and plaid, I was glad of a warm Siberian rug, the weather was so cold: perhaps I might have felt it more, after my illness in the Red Sea. We were accompanied by a tribe of thirty natives; banghy wallahs, 27 to carry our boxes, two torch-bearers, and additional ones for the dhoolies; 28 they were headed by our kitmutghar in a warm lebada, 29 or tight kind of cassock, brilliant green turned up with red, and a shawl turban of red lui, 30 or native blanket; he rode a queer little pony, which looked as though it had not a leg to stand upon, and was attended by a village boy, screaming and yelling, and unmercifully thumping the poor animal with a thick stick, the boy shivering with cold, and complaining it made his pêté 31 ache.\n\nAt some distance from Agra the country was well cultivated, and the crops looked fresh and green after the recent rain. The roadside was planted with peepul, mango, and toon trees; from the latter most of the furniture is made: it is something like the ash in foliage.\n\nWe passed several villages. My husband and I spent our time in reading \"Macaulay's History of England\" and \"Westward Ho!\" I felt grateful to the famous authors of these books for giving us so much interest and amusement when away from civilized life. You can read so much better in a dhooly; the motion caused by the jog-trot of the bearers is rather pleasant, and makes you sleep a good deal. In the evening we kept to our English custom of walking. We stayed the night at the bungalow at Dholpore, which is a large dismal-looking place.\n\nWe had now passed from the Company's dominions into those of an independent (at least in name) native Rajah.32 A Mahratta soldier appeared, sent by the Rajah of Dholpore, to know if my husband was a \"lord padre sahib,\" 33 for if he were, he would send him a guard of honour; but on my husband saying he was only a \"chota 34 padre sahib,\" 35 he vanished, but soon returned with one or two troopers, who were to guard us, as Dholpore is a celebrated place for thieves, and whom we rewarded with liberal \"bâksheesh.\" 36 A friend told me that when she and her husband were in tents near Dholpore, halting on their journey, they had everything stolen; her jewels, the tent-furniture, and equipments; and in the morning she had nothing but her habit to travel in.\n\nWe passed through the town of Dholpore, and in the distance saw our attentive Rajah's palace. The natives here were a robust, warlike set, well dressed in warm quilted lebados and trowsers, and gay turbans; they seemed to prefer the brightest reds and yellows in their attire, and were well armed with short daggers, matchlocks, and swords. I could not help thinking, when I saw these tall, stout, fierce-looking men, larger and more muscular than many in Europe, of the absurd notions many people at home have of the natives of Hindoostan; they think India is solely peopled with \"mild Hindoos,\" dressed in white garments, gliding about with graceful movements, and cringingly submissive: I only found them obsequious when they wanted anything from me. Many also think there is no greater difference between the inhabitants of Benares, Calcutta, and those of Rajpootana, Bundlecund, Rohilcund, and all the North-west Provinces, than there is between a native of Yorkshire and Wales. The inhabitants of Bengal are exclusively \"mild Hindoos,\" if they can now be called so: but the Mahrattas, Bheels, and Pindarees, are a strong, savage, martial race, and eat as large a quantity of good substantial food as an Englishman: they differ widely in appearance, dress, and manners, from the Hindoos. They are not bad-looking, with their black hair and moustaches, and rather harshly-marked features; but at heart most of them are cruel and bloodthirsty, and are only kept by our superior power from burning alive, swinging on hooks, crushing under the car of Juggernaut, and otherwise sacrificing victims to their vile religion: were it not for this, they would again return to Thuggism, Sutteeism, and burying alive. I think we have had sufficient proof of their treachery; yet actually, since my return home, people have asked me if I did not think the \"poor Hindoos much maligned and harshly treated!\"\n\nWe were ferried across the Chumbul in a rough boat, and I much regretted my inability to sketch the scene: the clear Chumbul, the fort in the distance, the picturesque banks, and wild-looking natives with their camels and bullocks flocking down to the river. The following lines, copied from a missionary's book of travels in India, will give you a better idea of the beautiful Chumbul than any description of mine:–\n\nThese lines give by no means an exaggerated description of the rivers of Hindoostan, so much grander than those of Europe.\n\nWe travelled the whole day, winding through narrow ravines and fording rivers, or crossing on crazy native rafts. The air was very sharp and keen. Our bearers were oddly wrapped up; their legs were bare, and their heads muffled up. They each carried a blanket, in which they rolled themselves at night; but too much clothing would encumber them. I was amused to see them put on their shoes whenever their turn for a rest came, and trot by the side of the dhoolies, vigorously smoking a \"hubble bubble\" and munching gram. They must have carried us forty miles a day, as Gwalior is eighty miles from Agra.\n\nWe halted at a village, and dined under some splendid trees, where I gave a small boy a packet of English and Egyptian coins; he ran off highly delighted and greatly astonished at the sight of a penny. We saw the Fort of Gwalior looming in the distance; it is called the \"Gibraltar of India.\"\n\nCHAPTER III.\n\nGWALIOR.\n\nWE arrived at Gwalior at twelve o'clock on the 8th of January. I was aroused from my slumbers by the dhooly being suddenly set down before a large white house, and was surprised to see a sepoy keeping guard, and several more lying on the ground asleep. The door was opened, and a servant appeared, saying our rooms were ready, and he would prepare us some tea; which was very welcome, as we had felt the cold greatly. I had not the comfort of smoking cigars like my husband. Captain and Mrs. Campbell had retired for the night, but sent their salaam, and hoped we would make ourselves comfortable.\n\nEarly next morning I was awakened by the cackling and screaming of poultry, and jumping up to see the cause of the excitement, beheld Mrs. Campbell, who had just returned from her drive, surrounded by about a hundred hens and cocks, fifty or sixty guinea-fowls, and ducks, geese, pigeons, and turkeys in like proportion, which she was feeding. She afterwards told me that if she did not daily see all the animals fed, the natives would steal them, or starve them by appropriating their food.\n\nMy husband went out to see what he could do about a house; but none were then vacant. There was only a chance of our getting a small house, when Major Macpherson, who then occupied it instead of the residency, left it; and a regiment was shortly expected to leave for one of the out-stations.\n\nI was very anxious to hear what the station was like, and was relieved when my husband said he thought it a pretty one.\n\nIt surprised me to see what a nice large house the Campbells had, after the unprepossessing accounts I had heard of bungalows – that they were \"low and dark, not to be compared to the pucka 38 houses.\" Bungalows are, however, cooler and better suited to the climate; having thick walls, thatched roofs, and sloping eaves, surrounded by a wide verandah, and a portico for carriages to drive under. Though they have not so many rooms as a pucka house, they contain a dining and drawing room, one or two small sitting-rooms, two or three bed-rooms, bath and dressing-rooms, all on the ground floor; also godowns 39 and bearers' rooms. The rooms are only separated from the roof by a piece of whitewashed calico stretched tightly across, which looks quite like a ceiling.\n\nI was agreeably surprised when I entered the Campbells' large, beautifully furnished drawing-room. Most of the furniture was English; but there were some curiosities from Burmah – solid silver cups, alabaster ornaments, and a bell and kezee, 40 exactly like those my husband brought us to England from Burmah. Some arm-chairs looked very odd, with their arms extending out for people to rest their legs on. The most curious things were some teak-wood sofas and chairs that Captain Campbell had brought from Burmah, the elaborate carving of which would have been admired even in a mediæval German town: two cabinets were carved all over with figures of Gaudama (the Burmese deity). The Burmese poongie-houses 41 are famous: I saw one being erected in the Auckland Gardens at Calcutta. A description of a Burmese pagoda, taken from a diary my husband kept in Burmah, will give a good idea of the carving, &c.\n\n\"We mounted our spirited Burmese ponies, and rode up to the Dagon Pagoda; on arriving at a flight of black granite steps, we dismounted and began to ascend. The whole was covered with an arcade supported on solid teak-trees, and in many parts covered with leaf-gold, or painted red. Emerging from this, we entered upon the large enclosure which occupies the summit of the hill and surrounds the great Dagon Pagoda. The scene here was extraordinary. In the centre rose the vast spire of the pagoda, surmounted by the golden umbrella, to the height of 320 feet, resting on a base, whose deep shadows and projecting angles and mouldings of every variety gave one the idea of the greatest strength and massiveness; while the ample court was crowded with a confused assemblage of smaller pagodas, elaborately carved and gilded poongie-houses, gigantic images resembling lions in a sitting posture, and covered with scales of silvered glass, wooden representations of the human figure upon birds, elevated on long poles; temples erected over immense bells; sacred trees, hung with all manner of decorations, some of which were long tubes of fine muslin stretched on hoops or metal pipes, or figures of elephants made of tinsel and paper: and smaller buildings of various shapes and sizes.\n\n\"Two bells there were larger than any I had before seen, and supposed to weigh between twenty and thirty tons; they were each surrounded by a carved and gilded canopy, supported on pillars made of gigantic teak-trees, and produced, when struck with a stone or brick, a very melodious sound. Mr. Bull pointed out to me a most remarkable and large sacred banyan-tree, probably a hundred feet high, from the highest branch of which a perfectly straight 'drop' had gradually grown downwards and taken root. Around the base of it was built a sort of altar, shaped like a crown, the interior being filled up with earth; and it was hung with muslin tubes and paper ornaments. The elevated platform of the enclosure commanded a most beautiful view of the surrounding jungle and winding river. Altogether the scene was the most striking that I had yet witnessed, and made me feel as if I were upon a different globe, and among a different race of beings from those to which I was accustomed. The interior of the Burmese pagodas are, like some of the Egyptian pyramids, solid, containing only a few small gold and silver images embedded in the brickwork, or, as they report, 'a tooth or lock of hair of Gaudama, the object of their worship.' Those of the Burmese who became possessed of wealth in times past, generally devoted it to the building and decoration of pagodas, and to the services of religion; and at the present time the great Dagon Pagoda is being re-covered with leaf gold by the contributions of the inhabitants of Rangoon, at a vast expense.\"\n\nBut to return to Gwalior. About two o'clock I was amused, at the ringing of a bell, to see about half a dozen horses appear with their syces, to be fed; then the goats and the fowls went through the same process; about three o'clock we dined. At five we drove out in a pretty carriage and pair to see the station. My first view was a pleasing one. The cantonments consisted of a row of large thatched houses in compounds, like pretty, gay gardens, on each side of a wide road bordered with trees, and about a mile long. The road had an English look: the people were driving and riding about, and the pretty, healthy-looking children (so different from those of Calcutta) also riding or driving in little pony-carriages. We passed the church, which looked exactly like an English one, and is very well built.\n\nEarly next morning I walked with my husband to have a good survey of the church; it was not surrounded with verandahs, nor had it windows down to the ground, or venetian, or a flat roof, like the other churches I had seen. These omissions added to the beauty, but not to the coolness, so important to an Indian church. It was small, with open benches, and the chancel paved with encaustic tiles from England. The windows – though not Waile's or Hardman's – were very prettily painted. The pulpit was of Caen stone, and the reading desk oak, with velvet cushions. On the communion-table was a velvet cloth, and books bound in Russian leather. There was an organ brought from England five years ago, but quite out of order. The architect was Major Vincent Eyre, of the Engineers.\n\nOn Sunday the 11th, my husband had a very kind note from one of Sir Robert Hamilton's brothers, saying that he and his brother (also a chaplain) would be very glad to assist him in the service; so the three chaplains divided the morning and evening services between them. The church was very well filled.\n\nOn Monday, according to an Indian custom, my husband began his round of calls. The inhabitants of the station consisted of the Resident, the Brigadier, the Brigade-Major, about thirty officers and their families, some men belonging to the telegraph office, and a few sergeants and drummers, all Europeans: there were four native regiments of the Gwalior Contingent, the rest being stationed at Jhansi, Sepree, and one or two other small stations. These troops belonged to the Company, and were officered by them, but were paid by the Maharajah of Gwalior, to whom the whole of that part of the country belonged, though under the surveillance of political agents.\n\nThe ladies then all called on me, and I returned their calls.\n\nOur first week at Gwalior was very gay, owing to the arrival of Sir Robert Hamilton, Agent to the Governor-General, on a tour; and with him General Havelock and his Staff, on their way to Persia.\n\nWe went to a large dinner given by the Gwalior officers to Sir R. Hamilton. Though I entered the room not knowing a single person in it (as Mrs. Campbell, being ill, could not go), my Scotch descent soon made me feel among friends; for every one nearly in India is Scotch or Irish: I met many of the former who knew my father's family in Dumfriesshire. I do think there were only half a dozen genuine English in the room, including my husband.\n\nThe mess-house was a large bungalow, containing a fine dining and drawing room, a billiard and several smaller rooms.\n\nOf course, the gentlemen outnumbered the ladies; and all the former being in uniform, there was nothing to contrast with the gay dresses of the ladies, except a few black velvet dresses which some of the ladies had wisely attired themselves in. I was struck with the youthful look of the whole party; very few had passed their \"première jeunesse,\" all were nice-looking, and not many unmarried; there was not one lady unmarried.\n\nThe rooms were brilliantly lighted and prettily furnished, and the dinner just like an English one, for what could not be procured in India had been brought from Europe; including hermetically-sealed fruits, fish, and meats, and preserves, with champagne, &c. The evening ended with music, singing, and games.\n\nA few days after, my husband went to a dinner in Sir Robert Hamilton's tent, and was introduced to General Havelock. I remember (being uninitiated into such things) asking him, on his return, \"if the tent was cold,\" and was told it was very luxurious, carpeted with thick Mirzapore carpets, and heated by stoves, and that the dinner reminded him somewhat of a Cambridge feast.\n\nThen the Resident gave Sir R. Hamilton a dinner, to which we all went. My husband went to a durbar, 42 held by Sir R. Hamilton and the Maharajah, in the latter's palace. I need not give a description of the levée; such things are well known now: there was the usual amount of nâtch girls, fireworks, &c., and my husband returned with a wreath of yellow jessamine, with which the natives always adorn their guests, and some packets of sweetmeats, and pawn, 43 and pieces of fine muslin scented with atta of roses, all of which I delighted my ayah by giving to her. My husband said he had seen many of the neighbouring chiefs, who had come to make their \"salaam,\" and thought them fine-looking men.\n\nUnfortunately the Rajah was a Hindoo; therefore, the cow being sacred in his eyes, we were not allowed any beef, except it was brought occasionally from Agra; but the distance and heat not being favourable, we seldom tasted any. We subscribed to \"the mutton club,\" however.\n\nI wish the Rajah had known what a grudge I owed him for this troublesome prejudice. These Hindoos are the most inconsistent people: I have frequently seen them starve and ill-treat their sacred animals in the most heartless and cruel manner; and have seen a poor bullock in a dying state, and in such suffering, that it would have been a mercy to put it out of its misery; but if you dared to do such a thing they would never forgive it, or let you forget it.\n\nI was astonished at the fine appearance of the sepoys whom I saw drilled and exercised every morning. They were tall, well-made, intelligent looking men; many of them more than six feet high. They looked a soldierly set in their gay regimentals.\n\nTheir lines 44 were rows of neat small houses on each side a road, planted with trees, and kept clean by mehters. 45 Each regiment had its separate lines and parade ground. They are well paid and handsomely rewarded, have a chance of promotion and of retiring on a good pension; all their fancies are humoured, and their religion and caste are attended to: even their festival days were kept, and (so far as I saw) their officers always treated them kindly; yet these very men were in a short time butchering their officers in cold blood.\n\nMany of the Gwalior sepoys were natives of Oude, and recruits were daily coming in.\n\nSoon after our arrival at Gwalior, we went to a pic-nic at the fort; and started early in the morning, at gun-fire. I must here remark how startled I was when I first heard the gun-fire at Gwalior; it was such a loud report, and so near the Campbells' house, it literally shook the bed; and then commenced the most absurd \"row,\" beating the tattoo, sounding the bugle, and practising the artillery. The gun is fired at sunrise, noon, and sunset. But to return to our pic-nic: it was bitterly cold. Captain and Mrs. Campbell rode, and we drove. We passed over the bridge; the nullah 46 was nearly dry then, but during the rains it swells to quite a river. We were amused to see the quantity of dhobies 47 beating the clothes in the water, or drying them on the banks. The country beyond was very ugly: nothing but low sand-hills; not a tree or blade of grass, and so dreary, it was difficult to believe we had left such blooming gardens and comfortable houses in the middle of it. Gwalior was certainly an oasis in the desert.\n\nWe saw the telegraph office and the place where the railway was to be continued to Indore from Agra.\n\nWe met parties of natives carrying gram and vegetables for sale to supply the small bazaar there. The road was very bad, not being made of kunkur. 48 When we reached the Lushkur, 49 six miles off, we found an elephant waiting, as the road was no longer fit for a carriage, and the ascent to the fort was steep. At the mahout's 50 order the creature knelt, and we climbed its huge sides by the help of a ladder, on to a pad – a large cushion on which four people could sit dos-à-dos.\n\nIt was my first ride on an elephant, therefore the rough jolting pace was rather fatiguing, but not so bad as I expected. The animal was so intelligent, and picked its way so carefully, I felt quite at ease. The mahout talked to it just as though it understood every word (perhaps it did), calling it by endearing names, such as \"my little son\" and \"my brother.\" The road here became so narrow there was only just room for the elephant, and the steps were very long and steep. The entrance to the fort was decorated with blue and variegated tiles, which still kept their colour. The fort is in ruins, situated on the summit of a rock four miles in length, rising with perpendicular sides in the midst of a flat plain, and about two or three hundred feet high. This fort was thought impregnable till it was taken by Major Popham, in 1778; but it was afterwards ceded to the Mahrattas, and had to be retaken.\n\nThe steps we ascended were formed of immense masses of stone, much out of repair, and ran sheer up the side of the rock. They were formerly defended on the side next the city by a wall and bastions. We wandered amongst the ruins of vast masses of masonry scattered about; some part of the building was still standing, and I thought what it must have cost to take it. As the sun was getting hot, we returned to some rooms in that part which had not been destroyed, and where the officers had lived when the fort was garrisoned. They were large and cool, and sometimes the families from the Mora 51 came up and occupied them for a short time for change of air. We found here the Alexanders and their merry children, Captain and Mrs. Gilbert, Lieutenant Cockbourn, Captain Cosserat, and several others.\n\nAfter breakfast we continued exploring the ruins, under the shade of large white umbrellas. There were some queer little caves cut out of the solid rocks, where the faqueers 52 used to live. We had a good view of the sandy plain stretched out below, where was a Mahratta encampment, the tents looking like little white dots, so far were we above. The large white palace of the Maharajah appeared some distance off: the Lushkur looked picturesque and large. This fort is dreadfully hot in the hot season, there being nothing to break the force of the scorching winds which blow over the low sandy country. We went into some of the halls, lofty and carved in stone; and into a dungeon sort of place full of rubbish and bats, where we broke off some of the coloured glazed tiles with which the roofs and walls were covered: but \"sight-seeing\" in India, under the heat of the dazzling sun, is very fatiguing, and we were soon glad to retire again to our pleasant shelter, where tiffin 53 was preparing.\n\nWe sat on the bastions watching the children playing about as merrily as any at home, and heard the distant hum of the natives rising from the plain. I was amused to see the host of natives required to bring up the tables chairs, &c., from cantonments. Many of them were women, and they made a tremendous chattering, jabbering, and squabbling.\n\nAn Indian pic-nic is very different to an English one, where you can scramble about as long as you choose, and where you are not obliged to rest in the cool nearly the whole time. The breakfast and tiffin were very good; both given by some officers of the mess.\n\nAt last we commenced our return home, and again climbed our trusty elephant. The rest of the party followed, some on elephants, some in tonjons, 54 some of the gentlemen riding. I remember Captain Cosserat riding his sure-footed Arab (a great favourite of his) down the steep steps after us. Poor fellow! he afterwards died of wounds received before Lucknow. Our descent was rather disagreeable work: though the elephant stepped very cautiously, its immense strides were rather disturbing to one's equilibrium.\n\nI enjoyed our pic-nic very much; though it was rather fatiguing to dress for a dinner party immediately after our return: but we spent a most pleasant evening at the Stuarts'. Mrs. Stuart was a most amiable person; young and very pretty, and so kind and friendly that I took quite a fancy to her. She played very well, and promised to teach me to tune my piano when it arrived, as it would not do to depend on a piano-tuner coming from Calcutta. Captain Stuart was very clever, and my husband enjoyed his conversation much. He played on \"the musical glasses,\" and their ethereal tones were very soothing. They had a little boy and girl, who came in after dinner, as is the custom in England. We met Captain and Mrs. Hawkins, both agreeable people. They had just come in with the artillery from one of the out-stations. Captain Hawkins gave my husband some good advice about visiting the out-stations, and said he \"should be glad to see him at Seepree; and as travelling in the cold weather was very delightful, he must bring me with him.\"\n\nWe also met Dr. Kirk, a thoroughly kind, warm-hearted Scotchman, who was just going his visits into the district, being superintending surgeon. Mrs. Kirk had gone to Calcutta to see her children off on their way to Scotland.\n\nIt is really strange to see how people meet again in such different places. One day we went to call on an officer, and I was astonished to see my husband shaking hands in the most friendly way with a (to me) strange gentleman. I soon found out he was Dr. Christison, whom my husband had met before in Burmah, and at Cambridge.\n\nI was much annoyed at the time; for our boxes, which we had sent off from Calcutta before we set out ourselves, had not reached Gwalior, and I had no evening dresses; all our wearing apparel being contained in two portmanteaus and some travelling cases. At last we heard they had arrived, and much disappointed we were on seeing only eleven great packing cases of books, linen, and crockery sent over by the Cape. One disadvantage to Gwalior was, it not being situated on the Grand Trunk Road, so that all our boxes and furniture had to be brought from Agra by coolies; but there was a corresponding advantage: we got our letters viâ Bombay, only four weeks viâ Marseilles, and five viâ Southampton.\n\nThe immense improvements that have been made within the last few years in the postal system are really surprising. Formerly a letter – that can now be sent from Calcutta to Bombay from the extreme south to the extreme part of the Affghan frontier, for the low rate of three farthings – cost one shilling; and now a letter can be sent from the centre of India to any part of Great Britain for sixpence. In former days you would not receive an answer to a letter sent by the Cape within a year; so it was like banishment: letters from the exiled one were like \"angels' visits, few and far between.\"\n\nMy husband found great amusement and occupation for a fortnight, in taking to pieces and replacing the church organ, which, as I have before mentioned, was quite out of order: a note could not be struck without the accompaniment of a ludicrous groaning kind of noise. He had studied a book on tuning, and being of a mechanical turn, and finding it hopeless to wait for the \"tuner from Calcutta,\" he set to work, and got on very satisfactorily; till one morning he came to me in a great state of perplexity, saying, if I did not come and help him, the organ would not be ready the next day (Sunday). I accordingly accompanied him to the church, and was very much astonished to see the different parts of the organ lying all about; however, as he had marked all the pipes and their corresponding places, I had nothing to do but hand them to him, whilst he replaced them, and soon all was accomplished to our great satisfaction. The next day one of the ladies played, and we arranged a regular practising day. Some of the ladies had been members of the Simla choir, which is a very good one. We learnt some of the very best chants and hymns, which added much to the beauty of the service, and I flatter myself that our church and service might have been compared with those of any small church in England. The officers also were very useful and kind in taking parts and blowing the bellows. At last my husband persuaded the church bearer, by the promise of extra rupees, to undertake it; who evidently thought it was himself who played: often, when I was practising, he would stop suddenly, and peep round the corner grinning, as if to show me how helpless I was without his assistance.\n\nAt last the small house was vacated for us by Major Macpherson, who went to Calcutta with the Maharajah. For six weeks we had been lookers-on, but now we gradually became initiated into the minutiæ of life at a small station. Most people kept from twenty to thirty servants; those who had children kept a bearer or ayah for each child. We kept about twenty; they cost from 100l. to 200l. a year, even in a station (and in the large towns like Calcutta they cost more), and we were told we should require more coolies in the hot season, to pull the punkahs. 55 We were obliged to keep a great number, as they will do only their own particular work: it required three to cook the dinner, one to wash, one to sweep, one to attend to the rooms, one to sew, one for the bullocks, one for the fowls, one to carry water for the animals, one for the goats and cows, two for each horse. Besides those I mentioned we required in Calcutta, and a gardener, my husband had a bearer and I two ayahs: a high-caste woman for a lady's maid, and a low-caste one to do the under work. This is to gratify another absurd prejudice; for the natives think you are not \"correct\" if you employ a low-caste woman about your person: a high-caste native won't stay in the same room with a low-caste, or touch or take anything from him. A lady told me she once sent her matrané 56 with a note to a sepoy, when he commanded her to throw it down, as he would not \"defile himself by taking it from her.\" Many people keep chuprassees and others, to perform what one man would do in England, but in Madras and Bombay so many are not required.\n\nWe bought a share in \"the Mutton Club,\" which is managed by an officer and hosts of satellites. The arrangements are as follows: – A flock of sheep is kept, and separated into three divisions; No. 1 is a lot of fresh sheep to be added to the others, called jungle-wallahs 57; No. 2 are grass-wallahs; No. 3 are grass and gram wallahs, or those given both grass and gram daily, ready for killing; so we had a plentiful supply of mutton – a shoulder one day, and leg the next: it was \"mutton hot and mutton cold, mutton young and mutton old, mutton tough and mutton tender\" every day, occasionally varied by fowls, fish, and game.\n\nWe also subscribed to the Book Club, which was a very good one considering the distance it was from the chief emporium of civilization. We had many of the new publications, \"Blackwood's\" and \"Fraser's\" Magazines, and several Indian papers, viz., \"The Delhi Gazette,\" \"The Friend of India,\" \"The Mofussilite,\" and a stupid thing called \"The Delhi Punch,\" a bad imitation of its witty namesake in England: but it required a more perfect knowledge of Hindoostanee than I possessed to understand its would-be witty sayings and pictures, which all referred to \"griffs\" and their mistakes.\n\nThere always are plenty of funds to be subscribed to in India; one for watering the roads, another for the band, &c. My husband had the partial superintendence of a school for natives kept up by the officers, who all paid a native Christian to teach them; my husband often used to go and hear the children read: some of the mistakes they made in translating were most amusing.\n\nThe officers were getting up a band, and even were sending to England for the musical instruments, which the sepoys were to be taught to play; but the mutiny put a stop to it, and all other improvements.\n\nIt was now the middle of February, and very cool in the morning and evening, and not oppressively hot in the middle of the day; indeed, we made all our calls from 12 o'clock to three.\n\nSome of the ladies walked a great deal: I knew one or two who used constantly to walk quite round the \"Course,\" four miles long, either morning or evening. We all wore warm shawls and cloth dresses, and kept good fires in our rooms.\n\nThe station looked its best, and a walk down the road was very pleasant, with the fresh, fragrant gardens on each side, filled with sweet-scented flowers; the magnolia, with their rich fragrance, and the bright scarlet blossoms of the pomegranate contrasting with its glossy green leaves, the soft puffy golden-coloured flowers of the barbul (the \"wax flower,\" as it is called, from the waxy look of its dark green leaves and white flowers), the Indian scented jessamine, various sorts of roses, and a large flower with petals like scarlet leaves, besides mignionette , larkspur, and other English flowers. The native flowers have either an overpowering scent, or none at all. The vegetables were all kinds of melons, potatoes, yams, cucumbers, and many others, the names of which I have forgotten. The trees were the neem, different species of acacia, mango, guava, orange, and lime, a few bamboos (but no palms, as they do not grow so far north), and a tree which blossoms like a laburnum. These gardens were divided by green hedges. The bungalows were either whitewashed outside, or coloured according to the inmates' taste; they had no doors, as at Calcutta, but gates, and gravel walks: most of them were occupied by pet animals of some kind, deer, doves, &c.\n\nThe road was a good one, made of kunkur and planted with trees; the \"Course\" was edged with grass, and the whole kept in order by a staff of bheesties 58 and coolies. There were no natives in Mora, as our cantonments were called, except the sepoys and bazaar people; but plenty at a few villages two or three miles off, and the Lushkur was densely populated, where the Maharajah lived, about five or six miles from the Mora.\n\nWhen the novelty wore off, it was very wearisome to take the same drive every day, with no change, and to meet so frequently the same people.\n\nHaving described a few of the floral beauties of Hindoostan, I must say a little for its animals; but it must be a brief mention, as I was not long enough in India to make the acquaintance of all its birds, beasts, and reptiles.\n\nI quite agree with the words of the song, \"our birds have a plumage like coloured gems;\" with the exception of the vulture. I often saw this monster waddling about, gorged with food, and felt a strong inclination to shoot it. What horrid feasts they have lately been making on the bodies of our unburied dead, left exposed to their mercy, in many a forsaken station! But they act the part of scavengers in a country where putrescence is poisonous. There are many kinds of doves, some just like our tame Barbary doves at home, others bright brown, with gold burnished breasts. The parrots are pretty, lively, but sadly mischievous creatures; bright green, with red legs and beaks, and a short purple ring round the neck. The mango bird has a brilliant yellow breast; sparrows, crows, and kites abound. The natives are very fond of a small quail, which, being of a very pugnacious disposition, they amuse themselves by teaching to fight like cocks at bonne. I have often seen them carrying these birds about in cages for the air.\n\nMany people keep a bird something like a magpie, with white wings and tail feathers, and a bulbul, or Indian nightingale; also a bird that only sings in the dark. The Brigadier kept several of these birds, and used to send them out every day to hear the other birds sing. The hoopoo is very pretty, with its yellow crest, which it can expand like a peacock's tail.\n\nTigers are not so plentiful as they used to be, but as I knew some ladies who had shot them, I suppose they are still extant. Bears and monkeys retire further into the interior, and do not frequent the stations as they used. Deer are to be found, and grey foxes; though not such fine ones as ours, with their splendid tails: but I need not recount the advantages of India as a sporting country. The squirrels are very pretty, striped grey and black, though troublesome: they squeak like guinea-pigs, and get into the \"choppers\" 59 of the houses. I once tried to tame a young one; but its parents and brothers made such a squeaking for several days, I was obliged to restore it to them.\n\nThe howling of the jackals at night is most disagreeable: I often used to lie awake listening to their unearthly yells, while feasting on some dead animal, or the half-burnt body of a native floating down the nullah. I saw several snakes, and some were killed in the garden and near the bath-rooms, which they frequent for coolness. I never saw a cobra di capella, but I heard of some people, mostly natives, who had been bitten by them, and died. We once had a scorpion killed in our room, and immediately had the carpets taken up, and the house searched. I knew several ladies who had been severely stung by these reptiles; the best remedy is chloroform, or laudanum. Frogs croak in chorus during the rains. Small lizards, rats, large red spiders, cockroaches two or three inches long, swarm in the house, and crickets; not only \"on the hearth,\" but chirping in the most excited manner all over the house.\n\nWe amused ourselves during the cold weather with riding and archery. The gentlemen often went out hunting foxes and deer, and for want of nobler game, jackals and porcupines. Some of the ladies shot very well, and as my husband was very fond of archery, we intended sending for our bows, &c., which we had left at home, thinking such athletic sports could not be practised in India.\n\nEvery one now looked healthy, and the rosy, pretty children played and laughed as merrily as they do at home. Their attendants were most kind to them; no English nurse would have borne with them, when they were fractious and irritable, as did these natives. I have seen a tall bearer carry an infant about for hours, and sing it to sleep, handling it as tenderly as possible: they watch by the children's beds at night, and if they awake, hush them to sleep, or fan them, and bathe their heads; tending them most carefully. The children are very fond of their own servants, and will cry to go to them; and the sepoys are very proud of their officers' children: I have often seen a little boy riding through the lines, and all the sepoys saluting him and talking to him most pleasantly. It was a very interesting sight to see a deaf and dumb native talking on his fingers to the children, with whom he was such a favourite, it was considered quite a treat to ask him to spend the day with them.\n\nSome of the regiments were reviewed during the cold weather, and I used much to enjoy watching them; particularly the Irregular Cavalry, with their small red turbans, often worn over a muslin or silk skull-cap, spangled with gold, their dark blue tunics turned up with red, red cummerbunds, light yellow trowsers, large top-boots, bright arms, and well groomed horses. The native saddle is made of cloth, the bridle of twisted cloth, and the saddle-cloth of two colours sewed in a pattern.\n\nCaptain Alexander and Lieutenant Cockbourn had much improved their regiment, and took a great deal of pains with it. Captain Alexander rode a very pretty horse, and looked very well in his gay regimentals. Some of the soubadahs 60 were fine-looking men, quite old and grey; they wore thick gold chains round their necks, had good-conduct stripes on their arms, and medals on their breasts. It was very amusing to see the recruits being drilled: they were not in regimentals, and \"marked time\" with their long bare legs and feet, which stood out in strong relief. The sowars 61 were very fine-looking men, and seemed fond of their horses, and as if they liked their profession. Strange to say, these men never attempted to shoot their officers in the mutiny, but let them ride off to Agra, and even sent their baggage under a guard: indeed, but for the force of example, they might have remained faithful.\n\nThe sepoys were exercised every morning on the parade ground close to the \"course;\" and it was rather nervous work to drive by, with a spirited horse, as they fired with blank cartridges right across the road, at a mark.\n\nWe really had enough of soldiering at Gwalior; bugles from morning to night, sentries posted all over, a guard to each house, and all the sepoys saluting whenever you passed them.\n\nI have dilated sufficiently on the bright side of war; the dark side has yet to come.\n\nAll this time these honoured, trusted sepoys were hiding their dread secret under the mask of submissive friendship, and lulling their unconscious victims into a fatal security; but soon they will become demons, and show their real characters, when the word is given for the slaughter! Can the massacre of Cawnpore, the struggle at Lucknow, the deaths of brave men, and women and tender children, ever be forgotten? Though India may again be a safe home, can it ever be a happy one? when the thresholds of our houses have been bathed in the blood of our friends and brothers? But enough has been said on this subject.\n\nWe had some trouble in procuring horses, and were obliged to return some sent from Agra, they were such miserable creatures; but we bought a little Arab from an officer who was leaving, and one for our buggy from another officer. The horses in India are a great trouble, being so vicious. Captain Campbell had one called \"Blazes:\" a very suitable nine for it. Horses are sometimes brought from England, but they don't thrive: in the rains they suffer from a disease in the hoofs; they are also subject to fits, falling down suddenly. I have been told a bottle of hot beer is the best restorer in such cases. They suffer much from the heat, and are not nearly so active in the hot season. You can always tell when the rains are coming, they get so skittish and play such tricks.\n\nWe heard by letters, and through the papers, of the grand \"doings\" of the Rajah at Calcutta; how he was enjoying himself and lavishing money, and gaining golden opinions: they said he spent a lâc 62 of rupees. I was much amused to see in \"The Times\" the following paragraph from \"our own correspondent\" relative to the Rajah and his proceedings:– \"The Maharajah of Gwalior, the chief of the Mahratta princes, is on a visit to Calcutta. He is an irascible, self-willed lad, very difficult to manage. He went the other day down the river to visit the Fort Gloucester mills. On his way he was particularly boastful, until he passed the house occupied by the King of Oude. The sight sobered him in an instant, and his zeal for civilization instantly increased. He has been well educated, but seems falling back to the true native style of thought. In England there is great sympathy for these men. In India it seems horrible that a boy of this description, without principle or restraint, should exercise, by our favour, power of life and death over some millions of people.\"\n\nHow differently is he thought of now! He is called the \"Saviour of India,\" \"the firm friend of the English,\" and \"the wonder of faithfulness;\" but I have good cause to think otherwise of him: I feel certain he might have helped us more than he did in the mutiny at Gwalior, else why did he not come down and try to stop the massacre the next morning, when he knew of it the night before – not too late to save many? One reason given for his (lukewarm) adherence to us is, his previously seeing our power at Calcutta.\n\nAbout this time some of our friends – the Meades and Murrays – went out to live in tents, some miles from cantonments. They seemed to enjoy it very much, as the ladies could relax from household cares, the gentlemen shoot and fish, and the children have more air and exercise. It seemed a pleasant sort of life, and though not quite under \"the greenwood tree,\" it was not a bad attempt at gipsying. The weather became much warmer, and we gave up fires and warm dresses.\n\nMrs. Alexander and her children went up to the hills, and talked of going to England next year, as she had children six and eight years old. Major Hennessey's sons also returned to their school in the hills, and Mrs. Stuart talked of taking her children there.\n\nWe now removed to a nice large bungalow, surrounded by a broad gravel walk, as a precaution against snakes: it stood in the middle of a very pretty compound, and was approached by a small avenue. The sitting-rooms were only divided by curtains hung across archways; the walls were light yellow, the mouldings picked out with white, which gave it quite a gay look. The garden was very well laid out, and filled with flowers and trees, and had a pretty walk, sheltered with an archway of vines.\n\nWe were soon settled in our new home, and had dirzies 63 to make up the carpets which had been brought from Agra, where they were made by the prisoners. Our buggy and my piano arrived, and, above all, a box of German and other new books, and the remainder of my husband's college books. Russian leather is the best binding for India, as the damp and insects spoil all other bindings.\n\nWe heard of the arrival of General Havelock and the officers of his division in Persia, and afterwards of their brilliant campaign, and General Sir James Outram's victories.\n\nThe shadows of the \"coming events\" now began to cast a gloom over us, and our calm was slightly ruffled by hearing of some disturbances at Dumdum and Barrackpore, about the cartridges for the Enfield rifle. Government had ordered mutton fat to be supplied by the contractors; but as they used pig's and bullock's fat, the sepoys soon found out the cheat, and made a \"row\" about \"caste;\" however, after a speech from the Brigadier, they quieted down, and we soon ceased to be interested in the affair, thinking it only some trifling explosion about that bugbear, caste. Then we heard of a mysterious affair about some chupatties. 64 It seemed that a chowkedar 65 of Cawnpore gave to a chowkedar of Futteghur two chupatties, with an order to make ten more, and give two to each of the nearest chowkedars to distribute in like manner. In this way they spread from village to village, and from province to province. Government was quite nonplussed. Some thought it was a ceremony to avert cholera, which had been frightfully prevalent in the North-West Provinces the year before; others said it was of superstitious origin; and some hinted at treason. But like everything connected with the natives, it was wrapped in mystery: certainly they were veiled under a marvellous cloak of caution, considering the deep and sanguinary plot they were hatching.\n\nDuring April the weather became much warmer, and we were obliged to alter the hours for service on Sunday to half-past six, morning and evening; indeed we were soon obliged to vacate the church entirely in the evening, and have service in the mess-house. Many people began to complain of fever, and all to look less blooming and healthy. We rose earlier in the morning, gave up walking, and never remained out after 7 A.M., nor ventured out till after sunset. We also had our punkahs and tatties 66 hung up. The latter are made of a fragrant grass that grows in the jungles, and, as they retain water a long time, make it pleasant and cool. All began making or repairing their therm-antidotes, a thing very like a large winnowing machine; it is covered at the top and sides with a frame of wet woven grass, and the hot air passing through is cooled by evaporation. The Campbells' were made of brick; and though they kept the thermometer in the house down to 60° when outside it was 120°, they quite spoiled the appearance of the house. These cost about 50l. each; but some are made of wood, and are cheaper. These are of no use at Calcutta, as they have no hot winds there. The following passage, taken from MacFarlane's account of the Mahratta campaign, will give the best idea of the heat in the provinces:–\n\n\"The country was everywhere swept by a burning wind, called by the natives 'the devil's breath.' It sweeps over the great sandy plains of this part of the country, and imparts to the atmosphere an intensity of heat which astonishes even those who had long been accustomed to the fury of a vertical sun. Westward of the Jumna this pestiferous current, this fiery blast, finds no rivers and lakes to temper its severity. One of the officers, who was scorched and withered by it, compares it to the extreme glow of an iron foundry, in the height of summer. Major Thorn says, though, even that is but a feeble comparison, since no idea can be formed of the causticity of the sandy particles, borne along with the wind like hot embers, peeling off the skin and raising blisters wherever they fall. The heat was so great the soldiers died by tens and fifteens daily. Young men, who went out in the morning in the full vigour of health and spirits, fell, down dead immediately on reaching the encamping ground, and many were smitten on the road by the noon-day sun, whose rays darted downward like torrents of fire.\"\n\nIt was very dull to sit before the tatties all day reading; for we could do little else. Not a sound was heard after seven or nine in the morning. Even the birds seemed scared into silence; but the great heat did not commence till the end of April, and was at its worst during May and June. The first warning we had of the coming heat was a curious phenomenon in the shape of a dust-storm. Suddenly one afternoon a violent wind came on, filling the air to a great height with fine dust, rendering it almost dark, and casting a lurid light over everything. The servants said it was the \"tufân.\" 67 The trees bent and shook, and the storm came on in all its fury. It grew darker and darker, and felt quite suffocating; everything was covered with fine sand, and the doors and windows shook and rattled. After lasting half an hour it grew lighter, and the servants opened the doors and began dusting the sand off the furniture. These storms are very frequent in India, and are said to do good by clearing the air.\n\nSome very agreeable people passed through Gwalior, on their way to Sepree: Dr. James and his wife. They had only just been married and arrived from England. Mrs. James was admired by everyone, and thought to be very pretty and engaging. They stayed a few days with the Kirkes. Poor things! they were shortly afterwards killed in the mutiny at Sepree, in a very shocking way.
