        "text": "Synopsis\n\nFord Fiesta 1.6S is an honest piece of machinery. The doors shut with a reassuring thud; the aircon work brilliantly; and it also has anti submarine seats and fake punched aluminium pedals.\n\nU mad?????? Thru the badlands of UP and Bihar???!��� I couldn���t help but grin when this message popped up on GTalk. It was a sultry Saturday evening. And I was still soaking up paroxysms of colleagues. Packing wasn���t over. Mom was going berserk in Kolkata. And there were deadlines to kill before I could orphan work and hit NH2.\n\n#Budget' 2024 with ET\n\nUnion Budget 2024 Live Updates\n\nThis was a long-awaited trip. I had seven days to reach Kolkata, meet my parents, and do a U turn. I had no information about the route. And a Google search yielded fuzzy results. So, I rounded up a few bare essentials ��� a GPS navigator, a camera with a big zoom, and a friend for some nice motivating conversation. And though I had a few options, I zeroed in on Ford India.\n\nI wanted a vehicle that was tough and fast. Tough because I dreaded the roads through UP and Bihar, and fast because I heard terrifying tales about the Maoists of Jharkhand! Ford obliged, and the next morning I had the keys to a dark purplish Fiesta 1.6S (officially the shade is called Morello meaning some kind of dark red cherry).\n\nI liked the car. It looked good, especially at night, when the chunky low alloys echoed the streetlight. The interior was thankfully done up in black. Black hides dirt, you see. And plus, I still don���t understand the Indian craze for ���luxurious��� beige interiors.\n\nBut the real fun started to seep in once we hit NH2. The road from Delhi to Agra is a breeze. And the 1596-cc\n\nDuratec was singing a lovely tune. By 9 am, through patches of heavy rain, we had crossed Sikandar Lodi���s city and were rushing towards Kanpur. Just one thought here: If you thought Delhi-Agra is good, try the stretch from Agra-Kanpur (270 km). I have seen a few good roads but I was pleasantly shocked to see the highway there. Speeds of over 150 kph are sustainable. But watch out for crazy cattle and oncoming traffic. In UP not only humans but cows too have a weird habit of using wrong way for commuting.\n\nBy late afternoon, we were making serious headway. And even at 170 kph the 1.6S felt well balanced. The suspension seemed just right (read stiff) and the handling brilliant. We bypassed Kanpur by afternoon and started pushing for Allahabad where we wanted to dock for the night. But by then we were famished to the point of passing out. Warning: Don���t expect any decent food joints after Agra!\n\nThere are two rough patches of roughly 30 km each on NH2. And both of them are stretches that merge into Grand Trunk Road. One comes just before Allahabad and the other somewhere in Bihar. The 1.6S took both these stretches in its stride without complaining. It���s laudable since I saw overloaded trucks and Boleros creaking and groaning through those giant craters.\n\nWe finally reached Kolkata next evening after leaving Allahabad at 10 in the morning. The drive through Jharkhand was again mesmerising ��� fantastic roads and dreamy landscape, especially Dalma Hills where there are curves that can compete with the best of circuits. In roughly 22 hours we covered around 1600 km, didn���t meet any Maoists on the way, and during the entire trip, other than its brilliant gas guzzling ability, the 1.6S never for once gave me reason to crib, good roads or bad.\n\nFinally, one morning in Kolkata as I stood on my balcony sipping tea, I looked at the car all plastered in mud in my driveway. I noticed the simple straight lines and the well-poised shape and smiled. Somehow, I had grown fond of it.\n\n#Budget' 2024 with ET\n\nUnion Budget 2024 Live Updates\n\nThis is an honest piece of machinery, I thought. No pretensions, no excuses. The doors shut with a reassuring thud; the aircon worked brilliantly; and even the single-disc music system rocked. And I loved the addictive ol��� school gear throws. Plus of course, the 1.6S has anti submarine seats and fake punched aluminium pedals, not that I care too much about them. Of course, a set of twin exhausts perhaps would have looked better but what the heck...\n\nI drove back to Delhi after three days. Most of my time in Kolkata was spent in trying to persuade my mom to let me drive back. And in between, I tried to amuse the peaceful Bengali community with my favourite pastime ��� burning rubber, literally. Yeah, the 1.6S can do that too, at the drop of a hat, squealing tyres et al. Just ask those over-concerned CPM cadres who complained to my mom!\n\n(Catch all the Business News, Breaking News, Budget 2024 Events and Latest News Updates on The Economic Times.)\n\nSubscribe to The Economic Times Prime and read the ET ePaper online.\n\n...moreless\n\n(Catch all the Business News, Breaking News, Budget 2024 Events and Latest News Updates on The Economic Times.)\n\nSubscribe to The Economic Times Prime and read the ET ePaper online.\n\n...moreless\n\nIt took 42 years of grit and finesse to turn a 2-minute promise into an INR9,000 crore brand whose taste unites India\n\nWhat this Sebi proposal for discerning investors means for MFs and PMS\n\nEconomic Survey’s plan to drop food from inflation targeting is a bad idea\n\nDollar bear cycle may fuel emerging markets rally till 2029: Rohit Srivastava of Indiacharts\n\nLessons for Indian cybersecurity from Google’s biggest acquisition ever\n\nRBI sets stage for the first shift in monetary policy stance since April 2022\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3"
