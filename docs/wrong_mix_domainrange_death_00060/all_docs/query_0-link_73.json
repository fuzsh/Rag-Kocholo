But here are nine that I’d eat all summer long.\n\nWho makes your favorite dinner salad? Let me know what I missed at eat@pioneerpress.com.\n\nThai & Stop Me from Crisp & Green\n\nAll the good bits were buried in this salad — but trust me when I say there were radishes, orange wedges, cabbage, basil, mint and carrots. It somes with shrimp, but I was feeling chicken, so switched it. The peanut butter dressing is just like your favorite peanut butter sauce — salty, sweet and satisfying. The best part about Crisp & Green’s extensive salad and bowl selection? It’s about as fast as going through a drive through.\n\nMultiple metro locations, including 975 Grand Ave. or 2111 Ford Parkway in St. Paul; crispandgreen.com\n\nAgra Harvest Salad at Agra Culture\n\nThis salad is one that’s actually so filling you don’t need to add protein, but a well-cooked piece of salmon was a welcome addition. Chock full of beets, cauliflower, kale, cabbage, cranberries, sunflower seeds and candied walnuts, the ingredient list reads like a health-food checklist. Oh, and it’s delicious to boot. I like to order ahead online so my salad (and smoothie, they make great ones) is ready when I arrive.\n\nFour metro locations, including 721 Cleveland Ave., St. Paul; 651-788-7009; agra-culture.com\n\nRoasted Beet and Goat Cheese Salad at The Copperfield\n\nSo often when we’ve been faced with a busy evening of kids’ activities lately, the answer to what’s for dinner is neighborhood gem The Copperfield, which is close to my kids’ school. And what I want in a restaurant in my hood is not only a juicy burger (they have) but also a crisp, green salad. This roasted beet salad is a classic combo — sweet, earthy beets and tangy goat cheese are made for each other — and if you add freshly grilled chicken, it’s filling enough that you’re not tempted by the fries on your dining companion’s plate.\n\n735 Maple St., Mendota Heights; 651-240-6759; thecopperfieldmn.com\n\nFarmhouse Salad at Churchill Street\n\nThis simple, well-executed and ultra-fresh salad might just be the most memorable one I tried for this story. Really great greens are at the heart of it, but springy asparagus, roasted beets, juicy chicken, a super light buttermilk dressing and enough parmesan cheese to coat the plate like a fresh snowfall all combine for a satisfying, virtuous meal.\n\n4606 Churchill St., Shoreview; 612-466-2596; churchillst.com\n\nNicoise Salad at French Meadow Bakery & Cafe\n\nI love a good Nicoise, and this one — loaded with bright greens, hearty roasted potatoes, vibrant green beans, salty olives and sweet tomatoes — is a winner. The perfectly cooked salmon on top makes it a really satisfying meal.\n\n1662 Grand Ave., St. Paul; 651-789-8870; frenchmeadowcafe.com\n\nShrimp Eggroll Bun Salad at Ngon Bistro\n\nAny bun salad is usually a good bun salad, but the super crisp shrimp eggroll version here is probably my favorite in town. Tender rice noodles, mixed greens, lightly pickled carrots, cucumbers, sprouts and a typical Vietnamese vinaigrette finish things off. If you haven’t been to Ngon’s patio, it’s a quaint little gem with an outdoor bar, pergola, chandeliers and lots of greenery. The craft cocktails here are creative and delicious, too.\n\n799 W. University Ave., St. Paul; 651-222-3301; ngonbistro.com\n\nFarmer Steak Salad at Ingredients Cafe in White Bear Lake\n\nThis gigantic salad is served on a platter-sized plate and is one of the most filling of the bunch I’ve listed here. A hefty portion of tender hanger steak is accompanied by greens, quinoa, beets, goat cheese, carrots and candied walnuts, and a house-made walnut vinaigrette really wakes the whole thing up. I love the fact that they often have live music for ambiance, too.\n\n4725 N. U.S. 61, White Bear Lake; 651-426-6611; ingredientscafe.com\n\nKurdish Salad at Babani’s\n\nLayers of rice, warm lentils, crisp iceberg, tomatoes and cucumbers are accompanied by juicy chicken here for a salad I’m happy to eat any time of the year. It’s probably the salad I crave the most, to be honest. It’s also accompanied by a slice of the restaurant’s fabulous bread, and if you order it for dinner, a cup of soup — I recommend the tangy, lovely lemon dowjic.\n\n32 E. Fillmore St., St. Paul; 651-602-9964; babanis.com\n\nCobb Salad at Foodsmith\n\nA well-made cobb salad is always a treat, and Foodsmith’s version does not disappoint. Fresh greens, plenty of blue cheese, crisp bacon, juicy tomatoes, zippy radishes, edamame and a perfectly cooked hard-boiled egg made me a happy diner. And the boozy version of an Arnold Palmer that’s currently on the cocktail menu was a great accompaniment on a recent 100-degree day.\n\n973 S. Smith Ave., West St. Paul; 651-330-0896; foodsmithpub.com\n\nOriginally Published: June 30, 2022 at 5:00 a.m."
