        "text": "Genetic studies have demonstrated the important role of adaptation throughout human evolution, including classic examples such as loci underlying pigmentation, and adaptation to high-altitude lifestyles and infectious disease (Sabeti et al., 2002; Ohashi et al., 2004; Lamason et al., 2005; Voight et al., 2006; Norton et al., 2007; Nielsen et al., 2007; Pickrell et al., 2009; Yi et al., 2010; Fumagalli et al., 2011; Grossman et al., 2013; Lachance and Tishkoff, 2013). Yet, we have a limited understanding of adaptation in human populations on historical timescales, that is, during the last tens of generations. The ongoing selective pressures shaping human genomic variation, and how quickly humans can adapt to strong selective pressures, remain unclear. Adaptation on these short timescales is of particular importance because large-scale migrations within the past thousands to hundreds of years have exposed human populations to new environments and diseases, acting as new selective pressures (Hellenthal et al., 2014; Mathias et al., 2016; Busby et al., 2016; Patin et al., 2017; Laso-Jadart et al., 2017; Nielsen et al., 2017; Fernandes et al., 2019).\n\nAdmixture—gene flow between previously diverged populations to form a new population with ancestry from both source populations—provides a particularly rapid opportunity for selection to act in a population by introducing alleles previously adapted in a source population into the admixed population (Huerta-Sánchez et al., 2014; Jeong et al., 2014; Racimo et al., 2015; Norris et al., 2020). Additionally, in recent human admixture, ancestry contributions from each source population are often large enough to introduce alleles at intermediate frequencies, potentially avoiding loss from drift (Ruiz-Linares et al., 2014; Mathias et al., 2016; Fernandes et al., 2019; Fortes-Lima et al., 2019). More generally, admixture is ubiquitous in human history (Moorjani et al., 2011; Hellenthal et al., 2014; Busby et al., 2015; Triska et al., 2015; Busby et al., 2016; Laso-Jadart et al., 2017; Patin et al., 2017); therefore, understanding the effects of selection in these often understudied populations is essential to the study of human evolution.\n\nThe admixture process may obscure the signals commonly used to detect selection by increasing linkage disequilibrium and changing the distribution of allele frequencies (Lohmueller et al., 2010; Lohmueller et al., 2011; Gravel, 2012; Racimo et al., 2015). Further, common signatures of selection, such as deviation from neutral expectations of the allele frequency spectrum, may not be sensitive to adaptation on the scale of tens of generations (Sabeti et al., 2006; Field et al., 2016). Recent progress has given insights into human adaptation during the past few thousand years by using allele frequency trajectories from ancient DNA (Lindo et al., 2016) or the distribution of singletons in extremely large data sets (Field et al., 2016). We focus on admixed populations as an opportunity to detect rapid adaptation using modern populations and moderate sample sizes, allowing broader sets of populations to be studied. That is, within-genome ancestry patterns across multiple nearby loci may be easier to detect than single allele frequency shifts (Tang et al., 2007). Further, ancestry-based methods constrain the timing of potential selection to post-admixture, providing concrete information about the timing of selection, whereas non-ancestry-based summary statistics may detect selection in the source populations.\n\nWe test this concept developing new ancestry-based methods to characterize adaptation to malaria during the ~20 generations since the founding of the admixed human population of Cabo Verde. The Republic of Cabo Verde is an archipelago off the coast of Senegal and was uninhabited before settlement in ~1460 by Portuguese colonizers and enslaved peoples from the Senegambian region of West Africa (Fernandes et al., 2003; Beleza et al., 2012; Verdu et al., 2017; Korunes et al., 2020), henceforth referred to as ‘European’ and ‘West African’ source populations, respectively. This is approximately 19–22 generations ago assuming a 25- to 28-year human generation time (Fenner, 2005). Recent analyses using genetic ancestry information alongside historical data confirmed that admixture in Cabo Verde likely began within the last ~20 generations (Korunes et al., 2020). In this study, we assume admixture occurred 20 generations ago, and we focus on three major island regions of Cabo Verde: Santiago, Fogo, and the Northwest Cluster (Figure 1A).\n\nThe malaria parasites Plasmodium vivax, P. falciparum, and P. malariae have been reported across the islands of Cabo Verde since settlement; recurrent malaria epidemics have primarily occurred in highly populated regions (World Health Organization et al., 2012; DePina et al., 2019). Santiago, which has consistently been the most densely populated of the Cabo Verde islands, has experienced the most substantial burden of malaria transmission since settlement ~20 generations ago. Personal and historical accounts of malaria incidence within Cabo Verde described the largest and most populous island, Santiago, as the most ‘sickly’ and ‘malarious’ (Patterson, 1988). In the last century, malaria epidemics of both P. vivax and P. falciparum have occurred primarily in Santiago (Snow et al., 2012; World Health Organization et al., 2012; Ferreira, 2017; DePina et al., 2018). It is not fully understood why Santiago has sustained a higher burden of malaria than the other Cabo Verdean islands (World Health Organization et al., 2012); however, it may be due to a combination of higher population density, climatic differences between islands, increased migration into Santiago, which has historically served as the main trading port for Cabo Verde, and the suitability of the island for the mosquito vector. The other two island regions we consider share ancestry components with Santiago, but largely lacked the selective pressure of recurrent malaria transmission, providing a unique opportunity to compare related populations with and without malaria as a selective pressure.\n\nWe hypothesized that admixture has facilitated rapid adaptation to the malaria parasite Plasmodium vivax via the malaria-protective Duffy antigen receptor for chemokines (DARC) locus (also known as Atypical Chemokine Receptor 1 [ACKR1]) in Santiago. The protective allele is almost fixed in West African populations and rare elsewhere (Howes et al., 2011; Gething et al., 2012). The malaria parasite P. vivax uses the chemokine receptor encoded by the DARC gene to enter and infect red blood cells. The Duffy-null allele (also known as FY*O, rs2814778) is protective against P. vivax infection via a single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) that disrupts binding of an erythroid-specific transcription factor in the promoter region (Mercereau-Puijalon and Ménard, 2010; Gething et al., 2012). Thus, individuals carrying the null allele have reduced expression of Duffy antigens on the surface of the blood cell, protecting against P. vivax infection. Duffy-null is a classic example of strong selection in the human lineage, and it has been estimated to be under one of the strongest selective pressures in human history (Hamblin and Di Rienzo, 2000; Hamblin et al., 2002; Kwiatkowski, 2005; McManus et al., 2017), suggesting it is a plausible selective pressure in Cabo Verde.\n\nInterestingly, this hypothesis goes back to a voyage in 1721 in which Captain Roberts, 1745 reported that a disease in Santiago is ‘dangerous to strangers’ during the rainy season. Consistent with ancestry-mediated protection from malaria, the record has been interpreted by medical historians to suggest that ‘foreign visitors and residents of European descent seem to have suffered more than the African and Afro-Portuguese majority’ from malaria in Santiago (Patterson, 1988).\n\nIn this study, we combine ancestry-based summary statistics and simulations to identify and characterize selection at the malaria-protective DARC locus on the island of Santiago during the ~20 generations since the onset of admixture. Importantly, we also consider the genome-wide consequences of this mode of selection. That is, we find that strong selection at a single locus may shift genome-wide ancestry patterns, with potential to bias demographic inference. The results of this study provide evidence for rapid adaptation in human populations and advance our ability to detect and characterize selection in recently admixed populations.\n\nUsing adaptation to malaria in the admixed population of Cabo Verde as a case study, we have demonstrated that admixture can facilitate adaptation in merely tens of generations in humans. Developing methods to identify and characterize post-admixture selection, we found that this rapid adaptation leaves detectable genomic signatures (Figures 1 and 2), with potential genome-wide consequences (Figure 5). Combining inference under two complementary methods, and under a range of possible dominance coefficients and initial allele frequencies, we estimated selection strength of s≈0.08 for the Duffy-null allele in Santiago (Figure 4). Our estimate is consistent with other studies that have inferred the strength of selection for Duffy-null ranging from ~0.04 (modeled under additive selection) in sub-Saharan African populations (McManus et al., 2017) and ~0.07 (modeled as recessive) to ~0.2 (modeled as dominant) in a Malagasy population with admixed African ancestry (Hodgson et al., 2014; Pierron et al., 2018). Our estimated strength of selection for Duffy-null is among the highest inferred for a locus in any human population.\n\nIntrogression of an adaptive allele can facilitate adaptation on short timescales, particularly for traits with large effects from single loci. When ancestry contributions from multiple sources are high, such as is common in recent human admixture, selection post-admixture can be a faster mode of adaptation, similar to selection on standing variation (Hermisson and Pennings, 2005; Hedrick, 2013).\n\nCommonly used ancestry outlier approaches have identified candidate regions for admixture-enabled adaptation in many populations; for example, at the HLA and LCT regions in Bantu speaking populations (Patin et al., 2017), the MHC locus in Mexicans (Zhou et al., 2016), and adaptation to high-altitude at EGLN1 and EPAS1 in Tibetans (Jeong et al., 2014). However, results from this framework alone can be difficult to interpret because drift post-admixture may substantially change allele frequencies and the distribution of local ancestry within and between individuals (Bhatia et al., 2014; Belbin et al., 2018; Calfee et al., 2020). Further, recessive deleterious variation masked by heterosis can similarly cause a signal of increased introgressed ancestry, especially in regions of low recombination (Kim et al., 2018). As a result, outlier approaches may have increased rates of false-positive detection of regions under selection. One recent approach modeled local ancestry deviations based on individual-level global ancestry distributions; however, determining a significance threshold for local ancestry deviations remains difficult (Busby et al., 2017). Outlier approaches also discard local haplotype information and are not informative about the selection strength or timing. Instead, we developed a suite of methods to identify and characterize selection post-admixture: the iDAT summary statistic, application of the SWIF(r) framework to estimate the probability a locus is under selection in an admixed population, and an ABC framework to jointly infer selection strength and initial admixture contributions (Materials and methods).\n\nMethods to detect adaptation driven by alleles introduced through gene flow in human populations have typically focused on ancient admixture between highly diverged populations, often with small contributions from one of the sources (Racimo et al., 2017; Jagoda et al., 2018; Setter et al., 2020). Recent advances leverage patterns of ancestry to consider recent admixture, though perform best for events at least hundreds of generations ago (Svedberg et al., 2020). Instead, we emphasize admixed populations as a model for adaptation on historical timescales, with selection dramatically changing genomic variation within tens of generations. This timescale is important for elucidating human history and has implications for conservation genetics and ecology in other organisms. Additionally, our summary statistic approach can be flexibly applied in a variety of inference methods. For example, our implementation in a likelihood-free ABC framework allows for flexible population history models fit to the population of interest. This approach moves beyond identification of loci under selection, allowing joint inference of selection and population history parameters.\n\nWe apply these methods to characterize post-admixture adaptation in the Cabo Verdean island of Santiago. The Cabo Verdean populations have a number of advantages for identifying and interpreting selection over the last ~500 years. First, the island geography minimizes within-population structure and provides comparison island populations with shared ancestry components to partially account for demography. Second, historical records give a clear boundary for the earliest onset of selection in the admixed population, based on the initial occupation and admixture in the 1460s (~20 generations in the past). Further, the European and West African source populations have high levels of genetic divergence for human populations, improving local ancestry assignment accuracy. Though errors in phasing or local ancestry assignments are possible and should be considered if applied to other scenarios, it is unlikely that such errors would create signatures as extreme and long ranging as we observe in Santiago.\n\nWe inferred that the Duffy-null allele rapidly increased in frequency after admixture as a result of its adaptive resistance to P. vivax infection. While we consider this to be the strongest candidate locus, given the large ancestry tracts, it is possible that selection at other nearby loci is responsible for the observed ancestry patterns. The Duffy-null allele shows extreme geographic differentiation, being nearly fixed in sub-Saharan African populations and mostly absent in non-African populations (Mercereau-Puijalon and Ménard, 2010; Howes et al., 2011; Gething et al., 2012 ), and multiple populations with ancestry from sub-Saharan Africa show evidence for admixture-enabled adaptation throughout human history at the DARC locus (Hodgson et al., 2014; Triska et al., 2015; Busby et al., 2017; Laso-Jadart et al., 2017; Pierron et al., 2018; Fernandes et al., 2019). Further, the Duffy-null allele has well-characterized functional protection against P. vivax, a malaria parasite with a documented record of recurrent transmission in Santiago since settlement.\n\nWe demonstrated how selection at the DARC locus may have affected patterns of ancestry genome-wide (Figure 5). The initial admixture contributions inferred under our model were lower than those observed in Santiago today, and we confirmed this pattern more generally in simulations. Population-genetic studies often use loci far from potentially selected sites as putatively neutrally evolving loci, or treat many dispersed loci as neutral based on the assumption that a few selected sites will not dramatically change genome-wide distributions of summary statistics. However, we found that selection on a single locus may shape patterns of ancestry genome-wide. Individuals with higher genome-wide proportions of ancestry from the source population carrying the beneficial allele are more likely to have a selective advantage in early generations post-admixture as recombination has yet to uncouple global ancestry proportion and the local ancestry of the selected allele (Pierron et al., 2018). The genome-wide consequences of adaptation at a single-locus were previously proposed by Pierron et al., 2018. However, the scale of simulations was limited, and the extent of this effect on the selected chromosome versus the rest of the genome was not explored. Using whole-genome simulations, we demonstrated that selection on an allele on chromosome 1 increases ancestry proportion on chromosomes 2–22; that is, the increase in global ancestry is not exclusively owing to an increase in ancestry on the selected chromosome (Figure 5B). We also showed that this effect can be detected over a range of moderate to strong selection coefficients. Finally, we illustrated how this effect may explain the discrepancy in our observed global ancestry and inferred initial admixture contributions for Santiago (Figure 5A). Therefore, since global ancestry is often used to infer initial admixture contributions, these and related demographic inferences may be biased under the common assumption that genome-wide patterns of ancestry reflect demography alone. Importantly, the change in global ancestry will likely have long-term consequences even if adaptation is relaxed. In the absence of negative selection, ancestry is not expected to revert to initial admixture proportions. Instead, drift will not change global ancestry in a specific direction, and the population will evolve neutrally with this new ancestry proportion (Pierron et al., 2018).\n\nDifference in observed and simulated global ancestry may be caused by a variety of statistical and evolutionary processes beyond selection, including sampling, estimation method, demographic model misspecification, different rates of migration over time, or drift. Regions aside from DARC may also have been under selection post-admixture in Santiago and therefore affected the global ancestry patterns. For example, it is possible there are other genetic associations with P. vivax susceptibility; however there are not many published and well-characterized examples (Zimmerman et al., 2013). Further, only mutations with large effects, such as the Duffy-null allele, are likely to show significant allele frequency deviations or ancestry-based signatures of selection in just 20 generations.\n\nWe also observed a cluster of extreme negative iDAT values on chromosome 16 [~chr16: 48,000,000–60,000,000] that may be of interest for future study. The 10 annotated genes in this region and associated gene ontology terms are included in Supplementary file 1. A cursory literature search returned no known associations with malarial response in this region, and it is more difficult to draw conclusions on selection history in this region without a prior hypothesis. That said, we note that this region does not show high proportions of West African ancestry compared to the genome-wide distribution (Figure 1—figure supplement 1). The extreme iDAT values in this region may be influenced by its adjacence to the centromere, which may affect the length of ancestry tracts.\n\nGenerally, we suggest that iDAT should be used as one line of evidence alongside other summaries of variation, such as those used in our ABC estimation and expected allele frequency calculations. Moreover, in the case of Duffy-null, we had a strong prior expectation for positive selection for the West African haplotype. Analogous to biallelic selection scenarios, with admixture between two source populations, it is difficult to distinguish between positive selection for one ancestry and negative selection for the other ancestry.\n\nAnother important limitation for ancestry-based methods of detecting selection in admixed populations is that they are best suited for scenarios wherein frequencies of a selected allele differ greatly between source populations, as is the case with Duffy-null. If an allele is present at similar frequencies in the source populations (i.e. regions of low FST between source populations), selection will likely affect both ancestries in the admixed population similarly. Future studies into the adaptive histories of admixed populations should consider this limitation on the pool of potentially adaptive variants that can be detected using ancestry-based analyses.\n\nThe framework developed here is broadly applicable to detect and characterize selection in other recently admixed human and non-human populations. For most analyses, we assumed a single admixture event 20 generations in the past. The simulation software we use, SLiM, makes it straightforward to consider other models of population history specific to populations of interest for future studies. Further research into the interaction of selection and demography will refine inference. Additionally, while the timing of admixture in Cabo Verde is well documented, our ABC approach may be extended to infer the timing of selection and admixture as well, as the tract length distribution is informative about these parameters (Gravel, 2012; Liang and Nielsen, 2014; Korunes et al., 2020). Indeed, we demonstrated the need to jointly infer selection and demographic histories."
