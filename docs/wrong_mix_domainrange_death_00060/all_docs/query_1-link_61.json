Burial will follow in City of Lubbock Cemetery under the direction of Calvillo Funeral Home and Chapel. Viewing will be on Wednesday, July 10, 2019 from 1:00 PM till 9:00 PM and Thursday July 11, 2019 from 10:00AM to 8:00PM.\n\nMr. Ford was called to be with the Lord on Sunday, July 7, 2019. He was born on December 14, 1951 in Lubbock to John W. and Cora May Ford. She preceded him in death in 2013. John married Ernestina Ybarra on September 29, 1999 in Lubbock. He was a car salesman prior to his retirement. His greatest joy was motorcycles. He loved to ride his motorcycle along with his friends (Los Carnales Motorcycle Club, Lubbock Chapter) anytime the opportunity arrived. He was also a master at working in his yard and keeping it meticulously groomed. If you throw any cigarette butts or bottle caps you better pick them up.\n\nSurvivors include his wife Ernestina, his father John W. and stepmother Samantha; Ollie Ruth Ford whom raised John Edward; seven sons, Christopher (Josie) Ford, Christopher (Amy Michelle) DeAnda, Michael Ford, John Jr, Daniel (Morena) Pierce, Adam Pierce, David Ybanez; four brothers, Glenn Ford, Eugene Ford, Thomas Ford, Bartholomew Mayberry; one daughter Denise (Mark) Ybanez; six sisters, Norvell Colbert, Ida Ford White, Deborah Crawford, Esther Jolivett, Almeda Ford, Felisha Mayberry; thirty-eight grandchildren.\n\nHe is preceded in death by a daughter Mary Joyce Williams (2017)."
