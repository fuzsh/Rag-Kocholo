        "text": "Zephyrus: What does Black History Month mean to you?\n\nJohn Ford: The word “History” means His-Story and Carter G Woodson, the founder of the holiday started Black History Week in 1926 to tell the Black Story. At that time Black Americans and their accomplishments were largely left out of the educational curricula during that period. Where blacks were mentioned, it was usually very demeaning imagery or discriminatory ideas. Therefore, BHM gives me an opportunity to discuss “Black Excellence” and the legacy and contributions of my heroes. People like Marcus Garvey, Haile Selassie, Emmett Till, and Mansa Musa.\n\nZ: Do you believe that EHS sufficiently recognizes Black History Month?"
