Clayton and Gertrude (Lane) Ford. John spent his over 40 year working career in the Rockford area as a real estate broker and retired from Dickerson Nieman in 2020. He also enjoyed his time with the Winnebago County Auxiliary serving for 20 years. He married the love of his life, Norma Moody on October 28, 1961, in Rockford, and they had two children. He loved his children, firstly being a father, but also enjoyed becoming their best friend too. John learned that his love and joy knew no bounds after his grandchildren were born, he made sure they knew he loved them to the moon and back. In his free time John enjoyed a good game of golf, antiquing with his sister and brother-in-law, or simply spending time in his yard.\n\nHe will be missed by those who loved him most, his wife of 62 years, Norma; his children John III and Lisa (Dai) Bui; his beloved grandchildren Isabella, Gabriella, and Hajime Bui; his sisters Mary Ann (Rich) Disch and Susan (Tom) Hougan; nieces and nephews Ann (Brett) Ludlow, Brad (Betty) Disch, Jennifer (Kevin) Oâ€™ Brien, Tommy (Lisa) Hougan, Andrew Hougan, Dan (Wendy) Hougan, Eric (Lesley) Hougan and all of their families. He is predeceased by his parents, in-laws Lester and Anne Moody, and his brother, Patrick Ford. A very special thank you to all of the staff at Wesley Willows for all of the care and compassion that was shown to John and the family throughout his care.\n\nA Memorial Mass will take place on Monday, July 8, 2024, at 11:00 a.m. at St. Bridget Catholic Church, 600 Clifford Ave, Loves Park, Illinois 61111.
