        "text": "Locations and institutions take on nearly human characteristics, varying in meaning from film to film, but always important in and of themselves. Similarly, his films contain inevitable rituals – a ceremonial dance, party or wake – functions of a growing communal spirit that draw a line between those able to accept the restraints of society and those who cannot. There are countless scenes of children learning the alphabet – a culture being transmitted. And there are always the funerals, through which the living draw strength from the sacrifices of the dead, even as they experience both a sense of loss and heightened consciousness of their own mortality. If, as has often been said, Ford was really a poet, he was most often a poet of death, his most lyrical scenes taking place in front of gravestones.\n\nAgainst this vibrant institutional background, Ford’s characters were affected but not dominated by the communal sensibility. The dramatic core of his work often rested in an individual’s testing himself against a society in transition – Lincoln rocking the complacency of the townsfolk by preventing a lynching, Judge Priest exposing the hypocrisy of an entire community on the day before an election in The Sun Shines Bright (1953), a young preacher challenging orthodoxy in How Green Was My Valley, and Ethan Edwards (John Wayne) refusing to turn his sword into a ploughshare in the aftermath of the Civil War, in what is now often regarded as Ford’s best film, The Searchers (1956).\n\nEditor’s picks\n\nOf the confluence of the individual, society and tradition in Ford’s films, writer and director of the film program at the New York Cultural Center Martin Rubin has eloquently written that “John Ford’s films . . .… find the point at which tradition had meaning and meaning had tradition. The darkness of his vision arises from the fact that when he finds values they are always in transition, on the verge of dying out, and his films often treat the complex phenomenon of the significance of loss and the glory in defeat. Ford’s heroes are caught between a meaningful past which is dying and a future that appears corrupt, unappetizing, or simply blank. These characters pass out of shadow and then in again, but the moment in between is the significant one in which the individual is measured.”\n\nThe typical Fordian conflicts have been defined by Peter Wollen in terms of shifting pairs of antinomies, most notably the struggles between the notion of the West as a wilderness or a garden, the competing ways of the settler and nomad, European and native, white man and Indian, the lawbook and the gun, the ploughshare and the sword, the family and the loner, and East and West. Ford not only dealt with all of these at the same time and within the same pictures but continually reworked, revised and reinterpreted them in his lifetime of filmmaking.\n\nMythologizing history\n\nDuring the Twenties, he was an unabashed optimist, seeing every advance in society’s march across the continent as a sign of inevitable end and righteous progress. In the Thirties, with the nation reeling from the Depression, he proceeded with greater caution, making films about good – indeed, benign – leaders, men like Judge Priest and Abe Lincoln, who knew when things had gone wrong, and possessed nearly superhuman wisdom and strength of character, setting a moral example that would bring out the best rather than the basest in their fellow citizens. His faith in progress reached a low ebb in the early Forties when, in How Green Was My Valley, he offered his most pessimistic film to date. Set in Wales, it avoided the immediate implications for the United States, but showed a once-idyllic community ravaged by unfettered industrialization and unchecked social change. By structuring it as the reminiscence of a boy now grown to manhood, he emphasized society’s failure to replace its faltering old institutions with new ones of comparable value.\n\nRelated\n\nThe second World War appears to have renewed Ford’s faith in many of those old values, and his optimism reasserted itself with a passion in his well-known cavalry trilogy (Fort Apache, She Wore a Yellow Ribbon and Rio Grande) and culminated in Wagonmaster (1950). In that film he conceived of the Mormon movement to Utah as a sacred mission, their grain more valuable than any worldly goods, their purpose higher than any secular calling, their will to succeed greater than any force that tried to stop them. Their triumph proved to be Ford’s last unequivocal endorsement of the values embodied in the conquest of the wilderness, for he spent the next 15 years making films that offered ever more potent challenges to the underlying assumptions of Wagonmaster and American optimism in general. In the sluggishly acted, poorly paced, but nonetheless beautiful Cheyenne Autumn (1964), it is the Indian who is seeking his homeland and the white man who is oppressing him. The celebration of the cavalry’s courage in the face of the Indians’ attack in Fort Apache has now turned into Washington’s shameful genocide against the red man (“… . . . a blot on our shield,” he once called it)."
