        "text": ". . . [T]he best personal picture of Ford and one of the best of any director at work....\n\n— Movie Collectors World\n\n. . . [A]bsolutely wonderful . . . immense warmth . . . an unforgettable read.\n\n— The Hollywood Reporter\n\n. . . [C]ouldn't be better.\n\n— Los Angeles Times\n\n. . . [A] treat from start to finish....\n\n— Daily News\n\n. . . [F]illed with laughs, film lore, care, love, and insight to the motion picture business that few can aptly express. . . . Company of Heroes deserves to be a huge best seller because it delivers! But even more, it deserves to be read and re-read....\n\n— Trail Dust Magazine\n\n. . . Reads so fluidly it's almost as if Carey is sitting in your living room narrating the story and you don't have to be a Western fan to appreciate this.\n\n— Brave New World\n\n[Carey is] unlike other Hollywood people. A brilliant raconteur. . . . By the end of the book, one feels one has lived in the surreal conditions of a Ford set on location, where grown men were treated like children.\n\n— Gary Wills\n\nCarey shows the care, tedium, challenge, and exhiliration of filmmaking, and provides an intimate portrait of the great director at work and the actors and actresses, such as John Wayne, Henry Fonda, and Maureen O'Hara, who were part of Ford's vision of America. Includes a filmography and numerous b&w photos.\n\n— Reference and Research Book News\n\nSince Ford remains the most honored U.S. picturemaker, arguably its finest as well, Carey's book is both a valuable treasure and a complete delight.\n\n— Peter Bogdanovich, Director of The Last Picture Show\n\nAbsolutely essential.\n\n— 50 Westerns From The 50s"
