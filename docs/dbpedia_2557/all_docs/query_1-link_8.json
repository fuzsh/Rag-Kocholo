        "text": "The Apple Vision Pro is mind blowing in many ways and signals an important inflection point in the industry. But there is also a lack of clarity in how this all comes together in devices that we'll want to take out into the world and use on a daily basis. I call it the \"messy middle.\" Camera/screen based MR/AR devices are great ways to preview the future, to test and learn, and take us toward the future devices that will be a part of our daily lives in a big way. My plea to the industry-- let's not lose sight of the ultimate goal: devices that can connect us to the real-world and people around us and make our experiece as human beings out in the world richer and better. I wrote a bit about how we view the future of AR here: https://lnkd.in/gquivyQn.\n\nHuge day today for the Immersive Tech industry! The Apple Vision Pro is officially out in the wild and I am super pumped! However, I completely agree with the views of John Hanke, CEO of Niantic, Inc., who I am a big fan of. ðŸ¤“ With all of the justified excitement surrounding the new headset and Spatial Computing, we shouldn't loose site of the purpose of AR/MR, to blend our digital realities with the real world and crucially one another in manner that makes our lives better not worse. That is what we are focused on at The Round. Spatial Computing is absolutely the medium of the next 20 years but it needs to be delivered with symbiotic relationship with the real world. So as to not end up in a dystopian nightmare. That said, I can't wait to get my hands on one! ðŸ˜Ž #spatialcomputing #AR #VR #immersivetech #applevisionpro\n\nConnection? Or isolation? Lots of talk this week about Apple's new Vision Pro device. It is without a doubt a marvelous piece of technology. It is surely a glimpse into an inevitable future where our primary digital surface will sit upon our eyeballs and be controlled with gestures by our eyes and hands. Sure, the technology will evolve to become smaller, lighter, and more capable of being worn as a companion in our day-to-day activities. But do we really want technology designed to promote isolation and a sedentary lifestyle? That's why I love this reminder from John Hanke. John's been at this a long time â€“ he's one of the creators of Google Maps, and started Niantic Labs. I have always loved Niantic, Inc.'s approach to developing AR experiences that promote connection with the outdoors, physical activity, and human connection. One of the first Niantic apps I got to dogfood while at Google was Field Trip, an app that used your location and a publisher database to provide information and recommendations about points of interest nearby. Imagine walking around town and receiving notifications with fun facts and historical context about landmarks and tourist attractions around you. It was a helpful way to explore, and an early demonstration of how we can overlay data in the real world to enrich our experience and understanding of the world around us. Field Trip promoted exploration and learning, as did later games like Ingress and Pokemon Go. What Apple has demonstrated with Vision Pro is amazing. I hope we can use it as a tech proof point and continue to focus on building products and designing experiences that promote better physical health, mental health, and greater connection between each other and with the world around us. #Apple #Niantic #Google #XR #techforgood #future\n\nAt Niantic, Inc., we believe that immersive technology should take you out in the real world and not cut you off from it. So, when we see all of the many devices out in the market, including the much anticipated Apple Vision Pro, we're excited about what it means for the industry as a whole and its potential for more. It means we're at an important inflection point or -- as our CEO & Founder John Hanke likes to call it -- \"the messy middle.\" All of these innovations are stepping stones towards a bright AR future.

The $3,499 mixed-reality headset is also available for preorder on Appleâ€™s website site starting 5am PT on Jan 19. Hereâ€™s the details from our chief correspondent Mark Gurman https://lnkd.in/eqUzdei9 The timing of the announcement is interesting: on the morning of day 1 of the Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas. This is first new product category Apple has entered in to since the Apple Watchâ€™s release in 2015. While the market for mixed reality will be a consumer-focused battle ground for Apple and the likes of Meta and Magic Leap, Appleâ€™s first target is developers and creatives. The Vision Pro is much pricier than the offerings from competitors but also is much higher spec: dual 4K displays and Mac-grade processors (custom Silicon) The first reaction when I saw it: external battery pack/power source connected via cable. And for a closer look, hereâ€™s an Apple Vision Pro walkaround from WWDC in June: https://lnkd.in/eA-TQNTE #MixedReality #VisionPro Apple #virtualreality #augmentedreality"
