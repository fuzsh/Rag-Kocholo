For example, a player can customize his character by selecting gender, facial appearance, body type, hair color/styles, skin tone, and clothing.\n\na character can be associated with additional attributes consistent with the theme of the MMORPG. For example, within a fantasy themed MMORPG, a player typically can choose to play a character selected from any of several races and classes.\n\nExamples of available races may include, humans, wood elves, high elves, dwarves, gnomes, dark elves, trolls, and ogres.\n\nExamples of classes may include clerics, druids, shamans, rangers, paladins, shadow knights, warriors, monks, rogues, bards, enchanters, magicians, necromancers, and wizards. Each of these choices may affect the appearance and capabilities of the player character.\n\nplayers can cause their player characters to interact with other player characters and computer generated non-player characters in a computer generated virtual (or game) world. These actions may affect the status of the players characters and/or the environment of the game world, and thus further affect the appearance and/or capabilities of the player characters.\n\nMost MMORPGs permit multiple avenues for advancement of player characters. These may include defeating enemies in combat, performing quests (quests are discussed in greater detail in relationship to FIG. 6 , below), exploration, or engaging in artisan activities. In many MMORPGs, successfully completing an activity which provides for advancement is rewarded by an award of experience points.\n\nPlayer characters may be organized into a series of increasingly powerful levels, with each increasing experience level requiring an increased accumulation of experience points. Higher level characters may fight with greater skill, tolerate a greater degree of damage before being defeated, have a wider range of abilities, or be capable of casting more powerful spells.\n\nMMORPGs permit player characters to advance by engaging in solo activities within the game world\n\nthe core of many MMORPGs is social interaction between the various players.\n\nMMORPGs generally permit player characters to form groups and for those groups to work together at a common goal.\n\nmany MMORPGs may include in-game features to facilitate group formation. For example, player characters can be visibly flagged by their players as âlooking for a groupâ (hereinafter âLFGâ).\n\nthe game world may provide predetermined locations for player characters who are looking for a group to gather.\n\nFIG. 1 illustrates a system 100 for playing a MMORPG.\n\nPlayers 110 a each install computer programs known as the game client 120 a , 120 b on their respective computers 130 a or computer-like devices 130 b .\n\nThese devices 130 a , 130 b connect, via a network 140 , which may be the Internet, to a game system 150 .\n\na network 140 which may be the Internet\n\nplayers 110 a are typically charged a fixed amount to purchase the game client software 120 a , 120 b and then pay a monthly fee for access to the game system.\n\nthe game system 150 includes at least one game server 151 for maintaining the state of the game world. Except for scheduled downtime to perform upgrades and administrative tasks, the server 151 is generally operated continuously, resulting in a game world which is persistent. Further, in order to avoid overcrowding of the virtual world, most MMORPGs support multiple shards (also known as instances) of the virtual world. Each shard generally shares a same basic design, but are generally populated by different sets of player characters. Thus, while each shard begins with a common set of initial states, the difference in actions taken by the player characters of each shard will cause each shard to have its own unique state. Alternatively, some shards may be operated using alternate rules of play, and thus may start with a different state than the common state. For example, in a game where most shards are operated in a predominately PvE mode, some shards may be operated to permit a greater range of PvP activities.\n\neach shard is supported by its own hardware.\n\neach shard may be supported by its own game server 151 .\n\nadministrative mechanism are built into the game system 150 to support moving characters between shards, thereby permitting expanding the number of game servers 151 when the MMORPG is increasing in number of players and contracting the number of game servers 151 when the MMORPG is decreasing in number of players.\n\nthe game system 150 may include other servers aside from one or more game servers 151 .\n\nmost MMORPGs utilize at least one authentication server 152 for authenticating player log-ins to the game system 150 .\n\nMost MMORPGs provide chat and/or message board services to its players. Such services may be provided by one or more messaging servers 153 .\n\nmessaging servers 153 provide the chat and message board services via a web based interface.\n\nmost MMORPGs bill players a subscription fee for accessing the server.\n\nBilling services may be provided by one or more billing servers 154 .\n\nthe billing servers 154 also provide a web based interface for players to enter and edit their contact and billing information.\n\na game master 111 is also shown in FIG. 1 .\n\nthe operation of any MMORPG generally requires a number of game masters.\n\nEach game master 111 is a customer service agent for the entity which runs the game system 150 .\n\nTheir role in the MMORPG may be to address customer issues. Such issues may include a character which is stuck in the virtual world due to a bug in the MMORPG, arbitrating a dispute between multiple players 110 a , or managing special events, such as holiday related events.\n\nthe game system 150 maintains the game world in a persistent state. Thus, a player can reasonably expect that even when the player is logged-out of the MMORPG, other players are playing the MMORPG and thus, changing the state of the virtual world.\n\na player can log-out of the MMORPG under certain predetermined conditions (e.g., the player's character is not engaged in combat, or the player's character is located in a safe location within the virtual world).\n\nthe state of the player's character is saved by the server and then the player's character is removed (i.e., vanishes from the perspective of other characters) from the virtual world.\n\nplayers 110 a represent players which are logged-in to the MMORPG, and therefore have characters which appear in the virtual world\n\nplayers 110 b represent players which have logged-out the MMORPG, and therefore do not have characters which appear in the virtual world.\n\nthe disclosed embodiments provide apparatus and methods for a MMORPG player to participate in at least one aspect of the MMORPG while using a mobile device.\n\nthe wireless device executes a mobile MMORPG client, which interfaces with the game server(s) of the MMORPG via a mobile MMORPG server. While the mobile MMORPG client generally supports a subset of the interaction capability a regular MMORPG, the mobile MMORPG client preferably supports one gaming mode not available to the regular client. This gaming mode is known as location based gaming and takes advantage of the inherent mobile nature of mobile devices.\n\na mobile MMORPG server is used to support location based gaming.\n\nFIG. 1 is an illustration of a conventional system used to play a MMORPG\n\nFIG. 2 is an illustration of one embodiment to permit players to have increased interaction with a MMORPG using a mobile device and a wireless network;\n\nFIG. 3 is an illustration of how mobile devices interact with a wireless network\n\nFIG. 4 is a more detailed illustration of a mobile device in accordance with one embodiment of the invention.\n\nFIG. 5 is a more detailed illustration of a mobile MMORPG server shown as part of FIG. 2 ;\n\nFIG. 6 is a flow chart illustrating location based gaming from a server perspective\n\nFIG. 7 is a flow chart illustrating location based gaming from a wireless device perspective.\n\nFIG. 2 a system 200 for permitting players to have increased interaction with an MMORPG in accordance with one embodiment of the present invention.\n\nSystem 200 includes a plurality of online players 110 a are playing the MMORPG by running a game client 120 a or 120 b on their computer 130 a or computer-like devices 130 b .\n\nthe computer 130 a and computer-like devices 130 b are coupled to a network 140 , which in one embodiment may be the Internet, to communicate with a modified game system 250 .\n\nthe modified game system 250 is illustrated to include a plurality of game servers 151 for supporting separate shards of the MMORPG, an authentication server 152 for validating users' log-ins, a messaging server 153 for providing chat and/or message board services, which are preferably web based, and a billing server 154 for billing the users who play the MMORPG, and for permitting users to enter contact and billing information via a secure web site.\n\nthe modified gaming system 250 also includes a mobile MMORPG server 251 , which will be described in greater detail later, in connection with FIG. 5 .\n\neach of the illustrated servers 151 , 152 , 153 , 154 , 251 are networked and thus messages may be passed between any of the illustrated servers 151 , 152 , 153 , 154 , 251 .\n\nservers 151 , 152 , 153 , 154 , and 251 are represented as discrete servers, it should be recognized that any combination of the above noted servers may in fact be implemented as a distributed system of multiple servers, or conversely, the multiple servers may be implemented with a lesser number of servers, or even a single server, by using for example, server virtualization technology.\n\nthe mobile MMORPG server 251 is illustrated as being a component of the game system 250 , and thus co-located with the other servers 151 , 152 , 153 , and 154 , one skilled in the art would recognize that the invention can be practiced using other configurations, for example, locating the mobile MMORPG server 251 in the wireless network 240 (such as at a wireless carrier's data center).\n\nthe system 200 also includes a plurality of offline players 110 b , and at least one game master 111 .\n\nthe game master 111 may be proximately located to the game system 250 , thereby permitting the game master 111 to directly interact with the game system 250 .\n\nthe game master 111 may be located at a remote location, such as an overseas call center, and may remotely interact with the game system 250 via a computer system coupled to the network 140 (not illustrated).\n\nthe system 200 further include players 110 c , who are no longer logged into the MMORPG, but unlike players 110 b , these players 110 c wish to continue to participate in the virtual world of the MMORPG.\n\nthe system 200 enables such users to continue to interact with the MMORPG through the establishment of a mobile MMORPG game session.\n\nthe mobile MMORPG session is supported by the modified game system 250 through the inclusion of a mobile MMORPG server 251 , which is in communication with the game servers 151 .\n\nthe mobile MMORPG session is supported for the users through the inclusion of additional software modules to each user's wireless device 210 .\n\nEach user's wireless device 210 can communicate with the mobile MMORPG server 251 , and thus the game servers 151 , via the wireless network 240 and the network 140 .\n\nthe wireless devices 210 are wireless telephones, such as cellular phones, which also support a computer platform for downloading and executing application programs at the phone.\n\nwireless telephones such as cellular phones\n\nPDA personal digital assistant\n\ntwo-way text pager a laptop computer\n\ntablet computer a tablet computer\n\nFIG. 3 is a more detailed illustration of the wireless network 240 .\n\nthe wireless network 240 includes a plurality of base stations (BTS) 320 which are arranged to provide coverage over a geographic area.\n\nBTS base stations\n\neach wireless device 210 is typically in communication with a just one of the BTSs 320 .\n\nBTSs base stations\n\nAnother example of such a situation may include calculating a geographic location of the wireless device 210 based upon the location of two or more BTSs 320 .\n\nthe wireless network 240 also includes a mobile switching center (MSC) 330 .\n\nthe MSC is in communication with each of the BTSs 320 , as well as another network.\n\nthe other network is the carrier network 340 of the wireless carrier operating the BTSs 320 and the MSC 330 .\n\nthe carrier network 340 may include a router 350 , for coupling the carrier network 340 to another network, such as network 140 , which in one embodiment is the Internet.\n\nthe wireless network 240 provides the capability for routing data between the wireless devices 210 and servers on the Internet through the uses of its BTSs 320 , MSC 330 , carrier network 340 , and router 350 .\n\nFIG. 4 is a more detailed illustration of the wireless device 210 .\n\nthe wireless device 210 includes a radio transceiver 410 for wirelessly communicating with one or more BTSs 320 ( FIG. 3 ) of the wireless network 240 .\n\nthe radio transceiver 410 is coupled to a bus 450 .\n\nthe wireless device 210 also includes a user interface 420 , which is also coupled to the bus 450 .\n\nthe wireless device 210 is a cellular telephone and the user interface 420 includes a display, a small keyboard, a microphone, and a speaker.\n\nthe wireless device 210 also includes a memory 430 , which is also coupled to the bus 450 .\n\nthe memory 430 may store code for supporting an application programming interface (API) 431 .\n\nthe API is the API associated with QUALCOMMÂ®, Inc.'s BREWÂ® platform, however, the wireless device may support other APIs.\n\nAPI application programming interface\n\nthe contents of the memory 430 also include a mobile client 120 c , a location based server (LBS) manager 432 , a presence manager 433 , and a privacy manager 434 , each of which are discussed in greater detail below.\n\nthe wireless device 210 preferably supports the feature of downloadable applications.\n\nthe MMORPG mobile client 120 c is installed in the wireless device via an application download from the wireless network 240 .\n\nthe wireless device 210 also include an application specific integrated circuit (ASIC) 440 , which controls the radio transceiver 410 , user interface 420 , and memory 430 via the bus 450 .\n\nthe ASIC 440 preferably includes a position determination equipment (PDE) 445 for identifying a geographic location of the wireless device.\n\nPDE position determination equipment\n\nthe PDE 445 may determine the geographic location of the wireless using a variety of methods. For example, the PDE 445 may use signals transmitted from global positioning satellites (GPS) received by the radio transceiver 410 and convert the GPS signals into location data. Alternatively, the PDE 445 may use signals transmitted between the radio transceiver 410 and one or more BTSs 320 ( FIG. 3 ) and use techniques based on some combination of triangulation, angle of arrival (AOA), time of arrival (TOA), or enhanced observed time difference (E-OTD), to determine the location of the wireless device 210 .\n\nGPS global positioning satellites\n\nAOA angle of arrival\n\nTOA time of arrival\n\nE-OTD enhanced observed time difference\n\nthe architecture of the wireless device 210 can be varied without departing from the scope of the invention.\n\nsome potential variations include having multiple radio transceivers 410 , having multiple memory units, including, for example, different memory units such as a DRAM base memory unit and a FLASH memory unit.\n\nat least part of the memory 430 may be embodied on the ASIC 440 .\n\nthe ASIC 440 may be a plurality of ASICs or some combination of a non-ASIC chip and one or more ASICs.\n\nthe PDE may be on its own chip, or alternatively, the PDE may be a software module residing in the memory 430 .\n\nthe mobile client 120 c is an important component of the system 200 for supporting players 110 c to continue to interact with the virtual world of the MMORPG. As with the regular client, the mobile client 120 c is an application which renders a view of the virtual world, and which provides a mechanism for the player 110 c to interact with the virtual world.\n\nthe detailed virtual worlds of the MMORPG are stored using a large amount of memory not normally available in wireless device. Accordingly, the quality of the view of the virtual world rendered by the mobile client 120 c and the level of player interaction permitted by the mobile client 120 c is typically a subset of what may be possible with the regular game client 120 a , 120 b .\n\nOne example of such limitations may be that players 110 c using the mobile client 120 c may be limited to certain portions of the virtual world. Another example is that players 110 c using the mobile client may be limited in their range of actions.\n\nPlayers 110 c might not be able to engage in PvP action, or mobile MMORPG players 110 c might only be able to engage in PvP action against other mobile MMORPG players 110 c , and not against players 110 a using regular clients 120 a , 120 b.\n\nAnother example may relate to how or whether players 110 a using regular clients 120 a , 120 b view or interact with players 110 c using the mobile client 120 a . Since the players 110 c using the mobile client 120 b are limited in their range of interaction, in one embodiment, the two types of online players, i.e., players 110 a and 110 c , are divorced from each other and one group of players cannot view or interact with another group of players. In such embodiments, certain portions of the virtual world may be restricted solely for use by player 110 c using the mobile client 120 c while the remaining portions of the virtual world may be dedicated to players 110 a using the regular client 120 a , 120 b.\n\nplayers 110 a and 110 c may be handled as normally as possible, thereby permitting interactions between the two groups of players 110 a , 110 c .\n\nDue to limitations associated with the mobile client 120 c it may be necessary to place similar limitations on players 110 a using the regular client 120 a , 120 b .\n\nplayers 110 c using the regular client 120 a , 120 b may be restricted to certain portions of the virtual world, and if a player 110 a using the regular client 120 a , 120 b enters into the restricted area, that player 110 a may restricted to operate as if the player 110 a were running a mobile MMORPG client 120 c .\n\na restriction on the mobile client 120 c may be that full combat capability may not be supported, and a portion of the virtual world permitted for interaction between the two groups of players 110 a , 110 c may be an auction house, which could be designated as a âno combatâ zone in the game, thereby permitting players 110 a , 110 c to engage in commerce but not combat.\n\nthe mobile MMORPG game supports one gaming mode not available to players 110 a using the regular client 120 a , 120 b .\n\nThis gaming mode is known as location based gaming, and takes advantage of the inherent mobility of mobile devices. Location based gaming will be discussed in greater detail below, in connection with FIG. 6 .\n\nthe mobile MMORPG client in order to support location based gaming, the mobile MMORPG client must have the capability of determining the physical location of the wireless device 210 in the real world.\n\nthe LBS Manager 432 is responsible for providing the geographic location of the wireless device 210 to the mobile client 120 c . In one embodiment, the LBS Manager 432 may obtain geographic coordinates from the position determining equipment 445 .\n\nthe presence manager 433 is used by players of the mobile MMORPG client 120 c to see other players of the mobile MMORPG client 120 c . More specifically, each player may also be flagged to indicate that the player is LFG, or wants to participate in location based gaming.\n\nthe privacy manager 434 is used to control a player 110 c 's visibility to other players 110 a , 110 c and to determine whether the player is accepting game related messages from other players 110 a , 110 c . This is because there may be times when the player 110 c is unavailable to engage in MMORPG related activity. Under such circumstances, that player 110 c likely would not want to receive MMORPG related messages. Accordingly, the privacy manager 434 can be used to indicate that a player 110 c is not available for mobile MMORPG related activities. Further, the privacy manager can also be used to automatically reject messages related to the MMORPG (as a whole), or just to the mobile MMORPG portion of the MMORPG.\n\na player 110 c may be actively looking for a group and can also use the privacy manager to flag himself so that other players 110 c would notice that he is looking for a group.\n\nthe game system 150 also implements a web page for the player to set his privacy level.\n\nFIG. 5 is a more detailed illustration of the mobile MMORPG server 251 .\n\nthe mobile MMORPG server 251 includes a game master (GM) interface 510 , a mobile MMORPG quest database 520 , a location mapper 530 , a real geography database 540 , a virtual geography database 550 , a mobile MMORPG interface, and a Notification and Privacy Manager 570 , which are arranged as shown in FIG. 5 .\n\nGM game master\n\nGM game master\n\nGM game master\n\na mobile MMORPG quest database 520 includes a location mapper 530 , a real geography database 540 , a virtual geography database 550 , a mobile MMORPG interface, and a Notification and Privacy Manager 570 , which are arranged as shown in FIG. 5 .\n\nthe GM Interface 510 The GM Interface 510\n\nthe GM interface 510 is a user interface module accessible by game masters of the mobile MMORPG. From this interface, game masters may design, modify, enable, disable, or delete mobile MMORPG quests.\n\nthe GM interface 510 is in communication with the mobile MMORPG quest database 520 , as described in greater detail below. After designing and enabling a new mobile MMORPG quests, a GM may use the GM interface 510 to host the quest as a live event by making announcements and picking players who wish to join the new quest. Alternatively, the game master may use the GM interface 510 to bind the quest to an in-game object, such as a non-player character who gives interested players the quest, thereby permitting players to choose with who and at when they may wish to participate in the quest.\n\nan in-game object such as a non-player character who gives interested players the quest\n\nthe mobile MMORPG quest database 520 is a database which stores the quests which are designed, modified, enabled, or disabled via the GM interface 510 . Existing quests may also be deleted from the quest database through the GM interface 510 .\n\nthe mobile MMORPG quest database 520 is in communication with the GM interface 510 , described above, the location mapper 530 , described below.\n\nthe real geography database 540 , the virtual geography database 550 , and the location mapper 530 are used to support location based gaming, which is discussed in greater detail below in connection with FIG. 6 .\n\nthe real geography database 540 is a geographic database of the real world, and preferably include both geographic information mapping locations to coordinate, as well as a point-of-interest database, for locating specific types of locations. For example, a point-of-interest database might be able to locate coffee houses, restaurants, malls, stores, other publicly accessible commercial establishments, parks, libraries, museums, publicly accessible government facilities, etc.\n\nthe virtual geography database 550 is a geography database of the virtual world.\n\nthe location mapper 530 is capable of querying and receiving information from both the real and virtual geography databases 540 , 550 . The use of the databases 540 , 550 and the location mapper 530 will be discussed in connection with FIG. 6 .\n\nthe mobile MMORPG interface 560 is used by the mobile MMORPG server 251 to send and receive messages between the mobile MMORPG server 251 and the player's 110 c wireless device 210 .\n\nthe mobile MMORPG interface 560 is also used by the mobile MMORPG server 251 to send and receive messages between the mobile MMORPG server 251 and servers 151 , 152 , 153 , 154 of the game system 150 .\n\nthe Notification and Privacy Interface 570 The Notification and Privacy Interface 570\n\nthe notification and privacy interface 570 is a component which interfaces with the mobile MMORPG interface 560 , and from the mobile MMORPG interface 560 , to the notification and privacy manager 434 of the wireless device 210 and the messaging server 153 of the gaming system 150 .\n\nthe notification and privacy interface 570 provides an interface to accept notification and privacy information from the notification and privacy manager 434 of the wireless device 210 , as previously described.\n\nthe messaging server 153 of the gaming system 150 preferably also supports a web page for accepting similar information.\n\nthe notification and privacy interface 570 therefore supports a wireless device 210 based method and a web based method for specifying whether a player 110 c wishes to participate in the mobile MMORPG game. Once the player's preference has been obtained, that information is communicated to the mobile MMORPG interface 560 and the appropriate game server 151 so that inappropriate messages are not sent players who choose not to participate in the mobile MMORPG game.\n\na quest is a series of tasks which a player accepts. The quest is completed when the player finishes the entire series of tasks. Typically, the player is awarded with a reward for completing a quest.\n\nthe series of task may be a single task or a plurality of tasks.\n\nat least one task of the quest will be a travel task for a player character to travel from a first point A to a second point B in the virtual world.\n\nFIG. 6 illustrates a process 600 for supporting location based gaming from the perspective of the mobile MMORPG server 251 , and encompasses the act the mobile MMORPG server 251 performs when creating and administering a quest having a single travel task.\n\nFIG. 7 illustrates a process 700 for supporting location based gaming in the same context, but from the perspective of the wireless device used the player 110 c.\n\nLocation based gaming is a mode of gaming not available to players 110 a using the regular game client 120 a , 120 b .\n\nLocation based gaming takes advantage of the inherent mobility of wireless devices and permits real world travel and interaction to translate into a set of similar actions in the virtual world.\n\na quest is created.\n\nthe quest is a single travel task requiring the player's character to travel from a first point A to a second point B, where both points A and B are in the virtual world.\n\nStep S 1 is typically performed by a game master working on the GM interface 510 ( FIG. 5 ).\n\nstep S 1 may also be performed by a game designer, who might have his own interface to the quest database (not illustrated).\n\nthe process 600 continues at step S 2 .\n\na distance criteria relating to the real world is created and associated with each sequential pair of travel waypoints in the quest.\n\nthe distance criteria includes a parameter specifying an allowable range of distances for a player to travel to a first waypoint and a parameter for specifying an allowable range of distances for the player to travel between the first and a second waypoint.\n\nthe distance criteria may only specify an maximum allowable range (i.e., no minimum range requirement).\n\nYet another embodiment may only specify the allowable range between the first and second waypoints without restricting the range between a player's current location and the first waypoint.\n\nStep S 2 may be performed by a game master working on the GM interface 510 ( FIG. 5 ), although a game designer may also design the distance criteria as part of the design of MMORPG.\n\nthe process 600 continues at step S 3 .\n\nthe mobile MMORPG server 251 receives, at its mobile MMORPG interface 560 , a message from the wireless device 210 of the player 110 c which communicates the location of the wireless device 210 in the real world to the mobile MMORPG server 251 .\n\nthe process 600 continues at step S 4 .\n\nthe location mapper 530 ( FIG. 5 ) is used to search the real geography database 540 ( FIG. 5 ), to set a location Aâ² in the real world to correspond to point A in the virtual world.\n\nthe location is a point-of-interest, for example, a coffee house.\n\nthe location mapper 530 then applies the distance criteria against location Aâ² to locate a real world location Bâ² which is assigned to correlate to position B in the virtual world.\n\nthe location Bâ² is a point-of-interest.\n\nstep S 4 is automatically performed by the location mapper 530 .\n\nstep S 4 is manually performed by a GM at the GM interface 510 ( FIG. 5 ).\n\nthe process 600 continues at step S 5 .\n\nthe mobile MMORPG server 251 receives, at its mobile MMORPG interface 560 , a message from the wireless device 210 of the player 110 c which communicates the location of the wireless device 210 in the real world to the mobile MMORPG server 251 .\n\nthe process 600 continues at step S 6 .\n\nstep S 6 the player's location in the real world is compared to the location Aâ² to determine whether the player has reached the starting point Aâ² associated with the quest.

The wireless device executes a mobile MMORPG client, which interfaces with the game server(s) of the MMORPG via a mobile MMORPG server. A location based gaming mode for use with the wireless device is disclosed.\n\nDescription\n\nFIELD OF THE INVENTION\n\nThe present invention relates generally to wireless communications, and more particularly to the use of location based services on a wireless device for interacting with a virtual world of a massively multiplayer online role playing game (MMORPG).\n\nBACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION\n\nPersonal computers and computer-like devices, such as gaming consoles, are capable of hosting games which allow individuals and/or groups of individuals to explore and interact with a virtual environment. Examples of gaming consoles include Sony's PLAYSTATIONÂ® series of consoles and Microsoft's XBOXÂ® series of consoles. The virtual environments presented in these games are highly detailed and typically present a gamer with a fantasy, science fiction, historical, or futuristic milieu.\n\nComputer gaming began as a single player experience. Subsequently, multiplayer games were created allowing more than one player to play the same game at the same time, either cooperatively to achieve a common goal, as a competition against one another, or a mixture of both. Aspects of the game where players compete with or against computer controlled entities are generally known as player versus environment (hereinafter âPvEâ), while aspects of the game where players compete against other players are generally known as player versus player (hereinafter âPvPâ). Initially, multiplayer games were designed for multiple players to play on a single computer or computer-like device. However, as networking technology became more common, multiplayer games were designed to be played by different players each playing on their own computer or computer-like device.\n\nAs computer and computer-like devices become more powerful, and as network connectivity (including connectivity to the Internet) became more prevalent, the complexity of computer games and the number of simultaneous players increased. One genre of computer games is designed for play by a large number of simultaneous players. Such games are typically known as massively multiplayer online role playing games, or MMORPGs. These games are also sometimes known as massively multiplayer online games, or MMOs. For consistency, this document will use only the term MMORPG. Examples of MMORPGs include, for example, ULTIMA ONLINEÂ®, EVERQUESTÂ®, STAR WAR GALAXIESÂ®, SHADOWBANEÂ®, CITY OF VILLANSÂ®, CITY OF HEROSÂ®, FINAL FANTASY XIÂ®, WORLD WAR II ONLINEÂ®, EVE ONLINEÂ®, EVERQUEST IIÂ®, WORLD OF WARCRAFTÂ®, and DUNGEONS AND DRAGON ONLINEÂ®.\n\nA MMORPG permits a large number of people to share a virtual experience together by allowing the individual players to interact with each other in small and large groups. Players create alternate personas in the form of player characters. Players generally have the ability to customize their player characters' appearance, physical, and mental attributes. For example, a player can customize his character by selecting gender, facial appearance, body type, hair color/styles, skin tone, and clothing. Additionally, a character can be associated with additional attributes consistent with the theme of the MMORPG. For example, within a fantasy themed MMORPG, a player typically can choose to play a character selected from any of several races and classes. Examples of available races may include, humans, wood elves, high elves, dwarves, gnomes, dark elves, trolls, and ogres. Examples of classes may include clerics, druids, shamans, rangers, paladins, shadow knights, warriors, monks, rogues, bards, enchanters, magicians, necromancers, and wizards. Each of these choices may affect the appearance and capabilities of the player character.\n\nBy controlling their actions, players can cause their player characters to interact with other player characters and computer generated non-player characters in a computer generated virtual (or game) world. These actions may affect the status of the players characters and/or the environment of the game world, and thus further affect the appearance and/or capabilities of the player characters. Most MMORPGs permit multiple avenues for advancement of player characters. These may include defeating enemies in combat, performing quests (quests are discussed in greater detail in relationship to FIG. 6, below), exploration, or engaging in artisan activities. In many MMORPGs, successfully completing an activity which provides for advancement is rewarded by an award of experience points. Player characters may be organized into a series of increasingly powerful levels, with each increasing experience level requiring an increased accumulation of experience points. Higher level characters may fight with greater skill, tolerate a greater degree of damage before being defeated, have a wider range of abilities, or be capable of casting more powerful spells.\n\nFurther, while many MMORPGs permit player characters to advance by engaging in solo activities within the game world, the core of many MMORPGs is social interaction between the various players. Accordingly, MMORPGs generally permit player characters to form groups and for those groups to work together at a common goal. In order to facilitate group formation, many MMORPGs may include in-game features to facilitate group formation. For example, player characters can be visibly flagged by their players as âlooking for a groupâ (hereinafter âLFGâ). Alternatively, the game world may provide predetermined locations for player characters who are looking for a group to gather.\n\nFIG. 1 illustrates a system 100 for playing a MMORPG. Players 110 a each install computer programs known as the game client 120 a, 120 b on their respective computers 130 a or computer-like devices 130 b. These devices 130 a, 130 b connect, via a network 140, which may be the Internet, to a game system 150. While there are various business models for recouping the costs of developing a MMORPG and operating the game system 150, players 110 a are typically charged a fixed amount to purchase the game client software 120 a, 120 b and then pay a monthly fee for access to the game system.\n\nThe game system 150 includes at least one game server 151 for maintaining the state of the game world. Except for scheduled downtime to perform upgrades and administrative tasks, the server 151 is generally operated continuously, resulting in a game world which is persistent. Further, in order to avoid overcrowding of the virtual world, most MMORPGs support multiple shards (also known as instances) of the virtual world. Each shard generally shares a same basic design, but are generally populated by different sets of player characters. Thus, while each shard begins with a common set of initial states, the difference in actions taken by the player characters of each shard will cause each shard to have its own unique state. Alternatively, some shards may be operated using alternate rules of play, and thus may start with a different state than the common state. For example, in a game where most shards are operated in a predominately PvE mode, some shards may be operated to permit a greater range of PvP activities.\n\nTypically, each shard is supported by its own hardware. For example, each shard may be supported by its own game server 151. Generally, administrative mechanism are built into the game system 150 to support moving characters between shards, thereby permitting expanding the number of game servers 151 when the MMORPG is increasing in number of players and contracting the number of game servers 151 when the MMORPG is decreasing in number of players.\n\nThe game system 150 may include other servers aside from one or more game servers 151. For example, most MMORPGs utilize at least one authentication server 152 for authenticating player log-ins to the game system 150. Most MMORPGs provide chat and/or message board services to its players. Such services may be provided by one or more messaging servers 153. Preferably, messaging servers 153 provide the chat and message board services via a web based interface. Further, most MMORPGs bill players a subscription fee for accessing the server. Billing services may be provided by one or more billing servers 154. Preferably, the billing servers 154 also provide a web based interface for players to enter and edit their contact and billing information.\n\nAlso shown in FIG. 1 is a game master 111. The operation of any MMORPG generally requires a number of game masters. Each game master 111 is a customer service agent for the entity which runs the game system 150. Their role in the MMORPG may be to address customer issues. Such issues may include a character which is stuck in the virtual world due to a bug in the MMORPG, arbitrating a dispute between multiple players 110 a, or managing special events, such as holiday related events.\n\nAs previously noted, the game system 150 maintains the game world in a persistent state. Thus, a player can reasonably expect that even when the player is logged-out of the MMORPG, other players are playing the MMORPG and thus, changing the state of the virtual world. Typically, a player can log-out of the MMORPG under certain predetermined conditions (e.g., the player's character is not engaged in combat, or the player's character is located in a safe location within the virtual world). When the player logs-out of the MMORPG, the state of the player's character is saved by the server and then the player's character is removed (i.e., vanishes from the perspective of other characters) from the virtual world. Conversely, when the player logs-in to the MMORPG, the state of the player's character is restored and the player's character is inserted (i.e., appears from the perspective of other characters) into the game world at the same location as when the player logged out of the MMORPG. In FIG. 1, players 110 a represent players which are logged-in to the MMORPG, and therefore have characters which appear in the virtual world, while players 110 b represent players which have logged-out the MMORPG, and therefore do not have characters which appear in the virtual world.\n\nMany of the players 110 b who are logged-off the MMORPG would like to be able to further participate in the affairs of the virtual world supported by the MMORPG. Such players 110 b may not have access to a computer 130 a or computer-like devices 130 b to run the regular game client 120 a, 120 b. Although such players 110 b may have mobile devices, generally, it is impractical to run a version of the standard game client 120 a, 120 b on the mobile device. This partially due to the enormous amount of data processed by the client 120 a, 120 b present the virtual world. For example, the game client for the WORLD OF WARCRAFTÂ® requires four gigabytes of memory. Accordingly, there is a need and desire for methods and apparatus to permit a player of the MMORPG to have increased interactions with the MMORPG.\n\nSUMMARY OF THE INVENTION\n\nThe disclosed embodiments provide apparatus and methods for a MMORPG player to participate in at least one aspect of the MMORPG while using a mobile device. The wireless device executes a mobile MMORPG client, which interfaces with the game server(s) of the MMORPG via a mobile MMORPG server. While the mobile MMORPG client generally supports a subset of the interaction capability a regular MMORPG, the mobile MMORPG client preferably supports one gaming mode not available to the regular client. This gaming mode is known as location based gaming and takes advantage of the inherent mobile nature of mobile devices. A mobile MMORPG server is used to support location based gaming.\n\nBRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS\n\nThe foregoing and other advantages and features of the invention will become more apparent from the detailed description of exemplary embodiments of the invention given below with reference to the accompanying drawings in which:\n\nFIG. 1 is an illustration of a conventional system used to play a MMORPG;\n\nFIG. 2 is an illustration of one embodiment to permit players to have increased interaction with a MMORPG using a mobile device and a wireless network;\n\nFIG. 3 is an illustration of how mobile devices interact with a wireless network;\n\nFIG. 4 is a more detailed illustration of a mobile device in accordance with one embodiment of the invention;\n\nFIG. 5 is a more detailed illustration of a mobile MMORPG server shown as part of FIG. 2; and\n\nFIG. 6 is a flow chart illustrating location based gaming from a server perspective; and\n\nFIG. 7 is a flow chart illustrating location based gaming from a wireless device perspective.\n\nDETAILED DESCRIPTION\n\nNow referring to the drawings, where like reference numerals designate like elements, there is shown in FIG. 2, a system 200 for permitting players to have increased interaction with an MMORPG in accordance with one embodiment of the present invention.\n\nSystem 200 includes a plurality of online players 110 a are playing the MMORPG by running a game client 120 a or 120 b on their computer 130 a or computer-like devices 130 b. The computer 130 a and computer-like devices 130 b are coupled to a network 140, which in one embodiment may be the Internet, to communicate with a modified game system 250. The modified game system 250 is illustrated to include a plurality of game servers 151 for supporting separate shards of the MMORPG, an authentication server 152 for validating users' log-ins, a messaging server 153 for providing chat and/or message board services, which are preferably web based, and a billing server 154 for billing the users who play the MMORPG, and for permitting users to enter contact and billing information via a secure web site. The modified gaming system 250 also includes a mobile MMORPG server 251, which will be described in greater detail later, in connection with FIG. 5. Although no internal network connections are shown within the modified gaming system 250 in order to avoid cluttering the figure, it should be understood that each of the illustrated servers 151, 152, 153, 154, 251 are networked and thus messages may be passed between any of the illustrated servers 151, 152, 153, 154, 251.\n\nWhile servers 151, 152, 153, 154, and 251 are represented as discrete servers, it should be recognized that any combination of the above noted servers may in fact be implemented as a distributed system of multiple servers, or conversely, the multiple servers may be implemented with a lesser number of servers, or even a single server, by using for example, server virtualization technology. Also while, the mobile MMORPG server 251 is illustrated as being a component of the game system 250, and thus co-located with the other servers 151, 152, 153, and 154, one skilled in the art would recognize that the invention can be practiced using other configurations, for example, locating the mobile MMORPG server 251 in the wireless network 240 (such as at a wireless carrier's data center).\n\nThe system 200 also includes a plurality of offline players 110 b, and at least one game master 111. As shown, the game master 111 may be proximately located to the game system 250, thereby permitting the game master 111 to directly interact with the game system 250. Alternatively, the game master 111 may be located at a remote location, such as an overseas call center, and may remotely interact with the game system 250 via a computer system coupled to the network 140 (not illustrated).\n\nThe system 200 further include players 110 c, who are no longer logged into the MMORPG, but unlike players 110 b, these players 110 c wish to continue to participate in the virtual world of the MMORPG. The system 200 enables such users to continue to interact with the MMORPG through the establishment of a mobile MMORPG game session. The mobile MMORPG session is supported by the modified game system 250 through the inclusion of a mobile MMORPG server 251, which is in communication with the game servers 151. The mobile MMORPG session is supported for the users through the inclusion of additional software modules to each user's wireless device 210. Each user's wireless device 210 can communicate with the mobile MMORPG server 251, and thus the game servers 151, via the wireless network 240 and the network 140.\n\nIn one embodiment, the wireless devices 210 are wireless telephones, such as cellular phones, which also support a computer platform for downloading and executing application programs at the phone. However, it should be understood that the principles of the present invention can also be applied to other types of mobile or portable communications device having a similar computer platform, such as some types of personal digital assistant (PDA), a two-way text pager, a laptop computer and a tablet computer.\n\nBefore describing the interaction of the players 110 c via their wireless devices 210 with the game system 250, it is helpful to review the operation of the wireless network 240 and the wireless device 210.\n\nFIG. 3 is a more detailed illustration of the wireless network 240. The wireless network 240 includes a plurality of base stations (BTS) 320 which are arranged to provide coverage over a geographic area. When in communication with the wireless network 240, each wireless device 210 is typically in communication with a just one of the BTSs 320. However, there may be some situations where a wireless device 210 is in communication with multiple BTSs 320. Such situations may occur when the wireless device 210 transiting between the coverage areas of two BTSs 320 and the wireless network is using a soft hand-off technique for controlling the transition between two different BTSs 320. Another example of such a situation may include calculating a geographic location of the wireless device 210 based upon the location of two or more BTSs 320.\n\nThe wireless network 240 also includes a mobile switching center (MSC) 330. The MSC is in communication with each of the BTSs 320, as well as another network. As illustrated, the other network is the carrier network 340 of the wireless carrier operating the BTSs 320 and the MSC 330. The carrier network 340 may include a router 350, for coupling the carrier network 340 to another network, such as network 140, which in one embodiment is the Internet.\n\nAccordingly, the wireless network 240 provides the capability for routing data between the wireless devices 210 and servers on the Internet through the uses of its BTSs 320, MSC 330, carrier network 340, and router 350.\n\nFIG. 4 is a more detailed illustration of the wireless device 210. The wireless device 210 includes a radio transceiver 410 for wirelessly communicating with one or more BTSs 320 (FIG. 3) of the wireless network 240. The radio transceiver 410 is coupled to a bus 450. The wireless device 210 also includes a user interface 420, which is also coupled to the bus 450. In one embodiment, the wireless device 210 is a cellular telephone and the user interface 420 includes a display, a small keyboard, a microphone, and a speaker. The wireless device 210 also includes a memory 430, which is also coupled to the bus 450. The memory 430 may store code for supporting an application programming interface (API) 431. In one embodiment the API is the API associated with QUALCOMMÂ®, Inc.'s BREWÂ® platform, however, the wireless device may support other APIs.\n\nThe contents of the memory 430 also include a mobile client 120 c, a location based server (LBS) manager 432, a presence manager 433, and a privacy manager 434, each of which are discussed in greater detail below. The wireless device 210 preferably supports the feature of downloadable applications. In one embodiment, the MMORPG mobile client 120 c is installed in the wireless device via an application download from the wireless network 240. The wireless device 210 also include an application specific integrated circuit (ASIC) 440, which controls the radio transceiver 410, user interface 420, and memory 430 via the bus 450. The ASIC 440 preferably includes a position determination equipment (PDE) 445 for identifying a geographic location of the wireless device. The PDE 445 may determine the geographic location of the wireless using a variety of methods. For example, the PDE 445 may use signals transmitted from global positioning satellites (GPS) received by the radio transceiver 410 and convert the GPS signals into location data. Alternatively, the PDE 445 may use signals transmitted between the radio transceiver 410 and one or more BTSs 320 (FIG. 3) and use techniques based on some combination of triangulation, angle of arrival (AOA), time of arrival (TOA), or enhanced observed time difference (E-OTD), to determine the location of the wireless device 210.\n\nOne skilled in the art would understand that the architecture of the wireless device 210 can be varied without departing from the scope of the invention. For example, some potential variations include having multiple radio transceivers 410, having multiple memory units, including, for example, different memory units such as a DRAM base memory unit and a FLASH memory unit. In some embodiments, at least part of the memory 430 may be embodied on the ASIC 440. Further, the ASIC 440 may be a plurality of ASICs or some combination of a non-ASIC chip and one or more ASICs. In particular, the PDE may be on its own chip, or alternatively, the PDE may be a software module residing in the memory 430.\n\nThe Mobile Client 120 c\n\nThe mobile client 120 c is an important component of the system 200 for supporting players 110 c to continue to interact with the virtual world of the MMORPG. As with the regular client, the mobile client 120 c is an application which renders a view of the virtual world, and which provides a mechanism for the player 110 c to interact with the virtual world.\n\nAs previously noted, the detailed virtual worlds of the MMORPG are stored using a large amount of memory not normally available in wireless device. Accordingly, the quality of the view of the virtual world rendered by the mobile client 120 c and the level of player interaction permitted by the mobile client 120 c is typically a subset of what may be possible with the regular game client 120 a, 120 b. One example of such limitations may be that players 110 c using the mobile client 120 c may be limited to certain portions of the virtual world. Another example is that players 110 c using the mobile client may be limited in their range of actions. Players 110 c might not be able to engage in PvP action, or mobile MMORPG players 110 c might only be able to engage in PvP action against other mobile MMORPG players 110 c, and not against players 110 a using regular clients 120 a, 120 b.\n\nAnother example may relate to how or whether players 110 a using regular clients 120 a, 120 b view or interact with players 110 c using the mobile client 120 a. Since the players 110 c using the mobile client 120 b are limited in their range of interaction, in one embodiment, the two types of online players, i.e., players 110 a and 110 c, are divorced from each other and one group of players cannot view or interact with another group of players. In such embodiments, certain portions of the virtual world may be restricted solely for use by player 110 c using the mobile client 120 c while the remaining portions of the virtual world may be dedicated to players 110 a using the regular client 120 a, 120 b.\n\nAlternatively, players 110 a and 110 c may be handled as normally as possible, thereby permitting interactions between the two groups of players 110 a, 110 c. Due to limitations associated with the mobile client 120 c, it may be necessary to place similar limitations on players 110 a using the regular client 120 a, 120 b. In such embodiments, players 110 c using the regular client 120 a, 120 b may be restricted to certain portions of the virtual world, and if a player 110 a using the regular client 120 a, 120 b enters into the restricted area, that player 110 a may restricted to operate as if the player 110 a were running a mobile MMORPG client 120 c. As an example, a restriction on the mobile client 120 c may be that full combat capability may not be supported, and a portion of the virtual world permitted for interaction between the two groups of players 110 a, 110 c may be an auction house, which could be designated as a âno combatâ zone in the game, thereby permitting players 110 a, 110 c to engage in commerce but not combat.\n\nThe LBS Manager 432\n\nThe mobile MMORPG game supports one gaming mode not available to players 110 a using the regular client 120 a, 120 b. This gaming mode is known as location based gaming, and takes advantage of the inherent mobility of mobile devices. Location based gaming will be discussed in greater detail below, in connection with FIG. 6. However, in order to support location based gaming, the mobile MMORPG client must have the capability of determining the physical location of the wireless device 210 in the real world. The LBS Manager 432 is responsible for providing the geographic location of the wireless device 210 to the mobile client 120 c. In one embodiment, the LBS Manager 432 may obtain geographic coordinates from the position determining equipment 445.\n\nThe Presence Manager 433\n\nThe presence manager 433 is used by players of the mobile MMORPG client 120 c to see other players of the mobile MMORPG client 120 c. More specifically, each player may also be flagged to indicate that the player is LFG, or wants to participate in location based gaming.\n\nThe Privacy Manager 434\n\nThe privacy manager 434 is used to control a player 110 c's visibility to other players 110 a, 110 c and to determine whether the player is accepting game related messages from other players 110 a, 110 c. This is because there may be times when the player 110 c is unavailable to engage in MMORPG related activity. Under such circumstances, that player 110 c likely would not want to receive MMORPG related messages. Accordingly, the privacy manager 434 can be used to indicate that a player 110 c is not available for mobile MMORPG related activities. Further, the privacy manager can also be used to automatically reject messages related to the MMORPG (as a whole), or just to the mobile MMORPG portion of the MMORPG. Conversely, a player 110 c may be actively looking for a group and can also use the privacy manager to flag himself so that other players 110 c would notice that he is looking for a group. As discussed below with reference to FIG. 5, preferably, the game system 150 also implements a web page for the player to set his privacy level.\n\nFIG. 5 is a more detailed illustration of the mobile MMORPG server 251. The mobile MMORPG server 251 includes a game master (GM) interface 510, a mobile MMORPG quest database 520, a location mapper 530, a real geography database 540, a virtual geography database 550, a mobile MMORPG interface, and a Notification and Privacy Manager 570, which are arranged as shown in FIG. 5. In the illustrated embodiment, there is one mobile MMORPG server 251 associated with all of the game servers 151, 152, 153, 154 of the game system 150. However, it should be understood that the invention may be practiced using other arrangements. For example, each game server may have integrated therein a version of the mobile MMORPG server 251.\n\nThe GM Interface 510\n\nThe GM interface 510 is a user interface module accessible by game masters of the mobile MMORPG. From this interface, game masters may design, modify, enable, disable, or delete mobile MMORPG quests. The GM interface 510 is in communication with the mobile MMORPG quest database 520, as described in greater detail below. After designing and enabling a new mobile MMORPG quests, a GM may use the GM interface 510 to host the quest as a live event by making announcements and picking players who wish to join the new quest. Alternatively, the game master may use the GM interface 510 to bind the quest to an in-game object, such as a non-player character who gives interested players the quest, thereby permitting players to choose with who and at when they may wish to participate in the quest.\n\nThe Mobile MMORPG Quest Database\n\nThe mobile MMORPG quest database 520 is a database which stores the quests which are designed, modified, enabled, or disabled via the GM interface 510. Existing quests may also be deleted from the quest database through the GM interface 510. The mobile MMORPG quest database 520 is in communication with the GM interface 510, described above, the location mapper 530, described below.\n\nThe Real and the Virtual Geography Databases, and the Location Mapper 540, 550, 530\n\nThe real geography database 540, the virtual geography database 550, and the location mapper 530 are used to support location based gaming, which is discussed in greater detail below in connection with FIG. 6. The real geography database 540 is a geographic database of the real world, and preferably include both geographic information mapping locations to coordinate, as well as a point-of-interest database, for locating specific types of locations. For example, a point-of-interest database might be able to locate coffee houses, restaurants, malls, stores, other publicly accessible commercial establishments, parks, libraries, museums, publicly accessible government facilities, etc. The virtual geography database 550 is a geography database of the virtual world. The location mapper 530 is capable of querying and receiving information from both the real and virtual geography databases 540, 550. The use of the databases 540, 550 and the location mapper 530 will be discussed in connection with FIG. 6.\n\nThe Mobile MMORPG Interface 560\n\nThe mobile MMORPG interface 560 is used by the mobile MMORPG server 251 to send and receive messages between the mobile MMORPG server 251 and the player's 110 c wireless device 210. The mobile MMORPG interface 560 is also used by the mobile MMORPG server 251 to send and receive messages between the mobile MMORPG server 251 and servers 151, 152, 153, 154 of the game system 150.\n\nThe Notification and Privacy Interface 570\n\nThe notification and privacy interface 570 is a component which interfaces with the mobile MMORPG interface 560, and from the mobile MMORPG interface 560, to the notification and privacy manager 434 of the wireless device 210 and the messaging server 153 of the gaming system 150. The notification and privacy interface 570 provides an interface to accept notification and privacy information from the notification and privacy manager 434 of the wireless device 210, as previously described. Additionally, the messaging server 153 of the gaming system 150 preferably also supports a web page for accepting similar information. The notification and privacy interface 570 therefore supports a wireless device 210 based method and a web based method for specifying whether a player 110 c wishes to participate in the mobile MMORPG game. Once the player's preference has been obtained, that information is communicated to the mobile MMORPG interface 560 and the appropriate game server 151 so that inappropriate messages are not sent players who choose not to participate in the mobile MMORPG game.\n\nQuesting, or the action of performing quests, is typically an important component of an MMORPG. A quest is a series of tasks which a player accepts. The quest is completed when the player finishes the entire series of tasks. Typically, the player is awarded with a reward for completing a quest. The series of task may be a single task or a plurality of tasks. Typically, at least one task of the quest will be a travel task for a player character to travel from a first point A to a second point B in the virtual world.\n\nThe mobile MMORPG supports location based gaming, which can be applied to any travel task undertaken in the MMORPG. Location based gaming will now be discussed in greater detail in relationship to FIGS. 6-7. More specifically, FIG. 6 illustrates a process 600 for supporting location based gaming from the perspective of the mobile MMORPG server 251, and encompasses the act the mobile MMORPG server 251 performs when creating and administering a quest having a single travel task. Similarly, FIG. 7 illustrates a process 700 for supporting location based gaming in the same context, but from the perspective of the wireless device used the player 110 c.\n\nNow referring to FIG. 6, the process 600 starts at step S0 and ends at S11. Location based gaming is a mode of gaming not available to players 110 a using the regular game client 120 a, 120 b. Location based gaming, as described below, takes advantage of the inherent mobility of wireless devices and permits real world travel and interaction to translate into a set of similar actions in the virtual world.\n\nAt step S1, a quest is created. As noted above, for the purposes of this example, the quest is a single travel task requiring the player's character to travel from a first point A to a second point B, where both points A and B are in the virtual world. Step S1 is typically performed by a game master working on the GM interface 510 (FIG. 5). Alternatively, step S1 may also be performed by a game designer, who might have his own interface to the quest database (not illustrated). The process 600 continues at step S2.\n\nAt step S2, a distance criteria relating to the real world is created and associated with each sequential pair of travel waypoints in the quest. In one embodiment, the distance criteria includes a parameter specifying an allowable range of distances for a player to travel to a first waypoint and a parameter for specifying an allowable range of distances for the player to travel between the first and a second waypoint. In other embodiments, the distance criteria may only specify an maximum allowable range (i.e., no minimum range requirement). Yet another embodiment may only specify the allowable range between the first and second waypoints without restricting the range between a player's current location and the first waypoint. Step S2 may be performed by a game master working on the GM interface 510 (FIG. 5), although a game designer may also design the distance criteria as part of the design of MMORPG. The process 600 continues at step S3.\n\nAt step S3, the mobile MMORPG server 251 receives, at its mobile MMORPG interface 560, a message from the wireless device 210 of the player 110 c which communicates the location of the wireless device 210 in the real world to the mobile MMORPG server 251. The process 600 continues at step S4.\n\nAt step S4, the location mapper 530 (FIG. 5) is used to search the real geography database 540 (FIG. 5), to set a location Aâ² in the real world to correspond to point A in the virtual world. Preferably, the location is a point-of-interest, for example, a coffee house. The location mapper 530 then applies the distance criteria against location Aâ² to locate a real world location Bâ² which is assigned to correlate to position B in the virtual world. Preferably, the location Bâ² is a point-of-interest. In one embodiment, step S4 is automatically performed by the location mapper 530. In another embodiment, step S4 is manually performed by a GM at the GM interface 510 (FIG. 5). The process 600 continues at step S5.\n\nAt step S5, the mobile MMORPG server 251 receives, at its mobile MMORPG interface 560, a message from the wireless device 210 of the player 110 c which communicates the location of the wireless device 210 in the real world to the mobile MMORPG server 251. The process 600 continues at step S6.\n\nAt step S6, the player's location in the real world is compared to the location Aâ² to determine whether the player has reached the starting point Aâ² associated with the quest. If so, the process 600 continues at step S7. If not, the process 600 returns to step S5.\n\nAt step S7, the mobile MMORPG server 251 communicates to the game server 151 that the player has reached location Aâ². This causes the game server 151 to advance the player's character in the virtual world to virtual world location A. The process continue at step S8.\n\nAt step S8, the mobile MMORPG server 251 receives, at its mobile MMORPG interface 560, a message from the wireless device 210 of the player 110 c which communicates the location of the wireless device 210 in the real world to the mobile MMORPG server 251. The process 600 continues at step S9.\n\nAt step S9, the player's location in the real world is compared to the location Bâ² to determine whether the player has reached the starting point Bâ² associated with the quest. If so, the process 600 continues at step S10. If not, the process 600 returns to step S9.\n\nAt step S10, the mobile MMORPG server 251 communicates to the game server 151 that the player has reached location Bâ². This causes the game server 151 to advance the player's character in the virtual world to virtual world location B, and the player, having just traveled from real world location Aâ² to real word location Bâ², has caused the player's characters to travel from virtual world location A to virtual world location B, thereby satisfying the travel task element of the quest created in step S1.\n\nNow referring to FIG. 7, the process 700 starts at step S20 and ends at S31.\n\nAt step S21, player 110 c signs on to MMORPG via a wireless device 210. In one embodiment, the sign on request is sent to the mobile MMORPG server 251, which communicates with the authentication server 152 on behalf of the player 110 c.\n\nAt step S22, the player character associated with the player 110 c interacts with the MMORPG and obtains a quest enabled for location based gaming. The interaction for obtaining the quest may be any number of mechanisms, including, for example, the player character interacting with a non-player character, the player character traveling to a predetermined location in the virtual world, or the player character responding to a quest announcement made by a game master 111.\n\nAt step S23, the wireless device 210 sends a message to the mobile MMORPG server 251 which communicates the location of the wireless device 210 in the real world to the mobile MMORPG server 251. The process 700 continues at step S24.\n\nAt step S24, the wireless device 210 receives instruction from the mobile MMORPG server 251 directing the player to travel to point Aâ².\n\nAt step S25, the wireless device 210 sends a message to the mobile MMORPG server 251 which communicates the location of the wireless device 210 in the real world to the mobile MMORPG server 251. The process 700 continues at step S26.\n\nAt step S26, the wireless device checks to see whether it received a message from the mobile MMORPG server indicating that point Aâ² has been reached by the player 110 c. If not, the process 700 continues at step S25. If so, the process continues with step S27.\n\nAt step S27, the player 110 c is notified as having reached, and the wireless device 210 receives instruction for the player to travel to real world location Bâ², and the instruction is displayed to the player 110 c. The process 700 continues at step S28.\n\nAt step S28, the wireless device 210 sends a message to the mobile MMORPG server 251 which communicates the location of the wireless device 210 in the real world to the mobile MMORPG server 251. The process 700 continues at step S29.\n\nAt step S29, the wireless device checks to see whether it received a message indicating that point Bâ² has been reached by the player 110 c. If not, the process 700 continues at step S28. If so, the process continues with step S30.\n\nAt step S30, the player is informed that the travel from Aâ² to Bâ² has completed the travel task portion of the quest. The process 700 ends at S31.\n\nLocation based gaming, therefore, takes advantage of the mobile nature of wireless devices and maps virtual world locations to real world locations. The real world locations are preferably publicly accessible points of interest, thereby permitting players to perform travel components of quests in the real world. While FIGS. 6-7 illustrate a simplified quest having only a travel task, many actual quests in MMORPG often include multiple travel segments and each travel segment can be handled in a manner similar to steps S2-S10. Additionally, at the beginning or end of each travel segment, the player character may be required to perform additional actions. These may include conversing with a non-player character, finding an item, killing a monster, etc. In location based gaming, tasks in the virtual world may also be mapped to a set of tasks in the real world, such that if the player performs a task in the real world, the mobile MMORPG server 251 would communicate to the game server 151 that the player character had performed the corresponding task in the virtual world.\n\nVariations on the real world activity may include having two separate players which are within a predetermined proximity travel to a same destination in the real world and to interact with each other. For example, a first and a second player may each be assigned differing Aâ² locations but a same Bâ² location. The quest, or a portion thereof, can be satisfied once both players have traveled from their respective Aâ² locations to the Bâ² location.\n\nLocation based gaming may also apply to groups of players, where a plurality of players within a predetermined proximity could form a group in the virtual and real worlds, and would be assigned the same Aâ² and Bâ² locations.\n\nThe present invention is therefore directed in part to an apparatus and method for permitted players of a MMORPG to continue to interact with the virtual world of the MMORPG through their wireless devices. Each player's wireless device includes a mobile MMORPG client and associated modules related to location determination, privacy management, and presence management. Each player's wireless device interacts with a mobile MMORPG server, which also communications with the game servers of the MMORPG. The mobile MMORPG server preferably includes a mechanism for creating location based gaming scenarios, which can be stored as quests in a quest database of the mobile MMORPG, thereby permitting the players on the wireless devices to engage in location based gaming.\n\nWhile the invention has been described in detail in connection with the exemplary embodiments, it should be understood that the invention is not limited to the above disclosed embodiments. Rather, the invention can be modified to incorporate any number of variations, alternations, substitutions, or equivalent arrangements not heretofore described, but which are commensurate with the spirit and scope of the invention. Accordingly, the invention is not limited by the foregoing description or drawings, but is only limited by the scope of the appended claims.\n\nClaims (26)\n\nWhat is claimed as new and desired to be protected by Letters Patent of the United States is:\n\n1.
