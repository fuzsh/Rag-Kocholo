        "text": "Hello Explorers,\n\nWe are excited to announce we will be launching the Niantic Sign-in integration for Niantic Wayfarer later today. This new integration adds to our previous sign-in method, which was limited to Google and Facebook accounts.\n\nThe Niantic Sign-in integration connects Wayfarer to the Niantic Profile, providing a simpler and more centralized account management experience. With this integration, you can now use your Niantic Profile to sign in to Wayfarer and access all of your account information in one place.\n\nBenefits of the Niantic Sign-in Integration:\n\nSimpler account management: You can now use your Niantic Profile to sign in to Wayfarer and access all of your account information in one place.\n\nCentralized account management: You can now manage your Niantic Profile, including your email address, password, and other account settings, from one central location.\n\nAdditional login support: You can now use Apple ID to sign-in to Wayfarer.\n\nHow to Use the Niantic Sign-in Integration:\n\nTo use the Niantic Sign-in integration, simply click on the “Continue with Niantic Sign In” button on the Wayfarer login page. You will then be prompted to select your authentication method followed by your account credentials. Once you have selected your credentials, you will be signed in to Wayfarer.\n\nImportant Note:\n\nYou can create a Niantic Profile by clicking on the “Create Account” link on the Wayfarer login page or by visiting the Niantic Profile homepage. Creating a Niantic Profile is not required to access Niantic Wayfarer at this time but we do plan to continue adding perks to having a Niantic Profile in the future. To access Wayfarer without a Niantic Profile you will follow the same first 2 sign-in steps as above.\n\nWe hope that you enjoy the new Niantic Sign-in Integration!\n\nCheck out the original post HERE.\n\nI see this is live again.\n\nOne thing I’ve immediately noticed is that my Niantic profile picture in the top right is not formatted to fit in the circle correctly, even though it does show correctly on other things that use my Niantic profile. It appears to be too zoomed out on Wayfarer, to the point that I can see the bottom and top borders of my picture and then blank spaces below and above them.\n\nThat’s a minor issue of course, but it would be nice if it could get looked at some time.\n\nIt would be nice to be able to log in to Wayfarer with my Niantic ID.\n\nHowever, there are still major problems with that Niantic ID itself.\n\nIt may not be in your control, but you should update it ASAP.\n\nIt is impossible to change your Google, Facebook, and Apple login email addresses at the same time in the game login.\n\nTherefore, it is possible to separate game login accounts and Niantic IDs, but not to integrate them.\n\nThis means that if you have some problem with your Gmail, Facebook, or Apple ID and try to discard these login email addresses and change them to a new login email address, you will not be able to do so.\n\nTherefore, I hope this will be resolved soon."
