Swim a 1/2 mile in the calm of Niantic Bay without waves or strong currents. Bike an 11.4 mile loop through the charming community of East Lyme with picturesque views and long straightaways along rolling, shaded roads. Run 3.2 miles along the oceanfront lined with cheering spectators before a spectacular beach finish.\n\nTeam Relay registration for 2 or 3 members is an option to enjoy the tri experience with the help of some friends. Additionally, an Aquabike registration is also available for those that do not want to or cannot participate in the run.\n\nRUN FOR GOOD"
