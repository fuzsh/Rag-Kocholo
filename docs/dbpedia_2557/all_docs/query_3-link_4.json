        "text": "Niantic games require certain personal information in order to operate in accordance with the Terms of Service. If you consent to your child’s use of the game, Niantic will collect certain personal information about your child:\n\nWe will collect and use your child’s device location information. Our games are location-based; the core feature is to provide a gameplay experience tied to a player’s real world location, so we need to know where your child is in order to operate these games for them and to plan the location of in-game resources (for example PokéStops within Pokémon GO).\n\nWe will ask your child to create an in-game username, so we can make their game account, and your child can personalize their experience.\n\nYou can review our Privacy Policy for more details on what personal information we collect and how we use and process the information.\n\nWe’re required by law to obtain verifiable consent from a child’s parent before we gather any personal information from the child. Because of this, we need to verify your identity so we know you are really you.\n\nOne of the most common, COPPA-approved methods used for verifying identity is to charge or authorize a small amount to a credit card. The credit card transaction proves your identity. That process is handled by our verification provider Kids Web Services, in accordance with their own Privacy Policy, meaning your credit card information will NOT be shared with Niantic. Your credit card will NOT be used for any other purpose.\n\nThe amount and type of transaction depends on your location:\n\nIn the US, this is a one-time charge for $1.00. This a payment and NOT a temporary authorization hold. The full amount of this charge is donated to charity by our identity verification provider Kids Web Services. No further charges will be made to your credit card after this verification payment.\n\nOutside the US, Kids Web Services places a temporary authorization hold for £0.30. Authorization holds are not charges and will be removed by your financial institution after approximately 7 days.\n\nIn the US, another method used for verifying your identity is to check your name, date of birth, mailing address, and the last 4 digits of your social security number against government records. That process is handled by our verification provider SuperAwesome, in accordance with their own Privacy Policy, meaning that your name, date of birth, mailing address, and the last 4 digits of your social security number will NOT be shared with Niantic. This information will NOT be used for any other purpose.\n\nIn order to ensure the maximum level of security over your child’s personal information, Niantic complies with both the Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA) in the US and GDPR-K: the provisions to protect children’s privacy in the European Union’s General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR).\n\nCOPPA and GDPR-K require obtaining verifiable consent from a child’s parent prior to gathering any personal information from the child.\n\nWe comply with this requirement through the Niantic Kids Parent Portal with a verification and consent process handled by Kids Web Services. In order to do so, Kids Web Services requires certain personal information about you to prove you are really you and to block anyone trying to impersonate you. Any such information is collected by Kids Web Services in accordance with their own Privacy Policy. You may contact Kids Web Services directly at privacy@kidswebservices.com for any questions related to their handling of user information, especially parent information.\n\nOnce verified, you can grant permission for games to access information about your child.\n\nIf you do not provide consent within a reasonable time of receiving the initial permission request email, then the record of your online contact information will be deleted.\n\nYou will be able to monitor the information stored for more than one child in the Niantic Kids Parent Portal. When a new child signs up to a Niantic game and provides your email address, you will be notified and will be able to view their permissions, just as you did with the first child.\n\nYou will be able to toggle between your children on the “My Child” page.\n\nYou can delete your account and/or any of your child’s accounts within the Niantic Kids Parent Portal.\n\nTo delete your (parent) Niantic Kids account:\n\nVisit the Niantic Kids Parent Portal and select “My Profile” menu option.\n\nClick the “Edit Profile” button\n\nAt the bottom of the page, click the “Delete” link.\n\nTo delete your child’s Niantic Kids account:\n\nVisit the Niantic Kids Parent Portal and select your child’s account.\n\nClick the “Edit Profile” button\n\nAt the bottom of the page, click the “Delete child’s profile” link.\n\nNote that deleting a Niantic Kids account is not the same as deleting a Pokémon GO account. Deleting a Niantic Kids account only deletes data you provided to the Niantic Kids platform for account creation and verification. It does not automatically delete personal data associated with Pokémon GO gameplay. To permanently delete a Pokémon GO account and the personal data associated with it, please fill out this form. To access your child’s Pokémon GO account data, please refer to instructions found within the Niantic privacy policy."
