To preserve the integrity of our system, we do not discuss the internal mechanisms which detect illegitimate gameplay.\n\nHow many reports are required to ban a player?\n\nThere is a misconception that we ban players based on the volume of reports received alone; this is not the case. A player being reported by several unique players may lead to a more detailed investigation. However, we only take action after identifying and confirming proof of inappropriate activity. Please note, the same person submitting multiple reports of a player does not expedite their investigation.\n\nWho reported me?\n\nTo protect the privacy of others, it's our policy to not reveal the sources of our reports. Note that in some cases, automated detection mechanisms flag accounts for suspension without anyone having to report the account to Niantic."
