        "text": "Trailer\n\nLeading with a highly energetic and cinematic live-action trailer to kick off the Season of GO, we set the tone for the campaign and drove upfront awareness for the biggest Pokémon event of the year, called GO Fest, as fans from all around the world joined together to play games.\n\nIn this spot directed by TPG director Vanessa Marzaroli (and developed start to finish by TPG) players of all kinds get shaken from their daily doldrums by Pokémon GO. By the end, they’re outside enjoying the fun and adventure of GO Fest and the Season of GO. We finish with the call to action: “It’s time to get out and GO!” driving ticket purchase.\n\nSocial\n\nFor our robust social rollout campaign, we engaged and challenged our audience to drive participation. As an example, to drive in-app experiences, we created an asset that invited Trainers to partake in a #15minGOadventure and activate their daily incense to open the possibilities of attracting and catching more Pokémon.\n\nIn addition, we developed a digital scavenger hunt, where we hid “Golden Razz Berries” in our social images, vidoes, and blog posts. We then prompted our Pokémon community to find them for a chance to win a GO Fest ticket."
