I can confirm that I also see the app attempting to use the following URLs:\n\npgorelease.nianticlabs.com\n\n- Using a *.nianticlabs.com certificate\n\nappload.ingest.crittercism.com\n\n- Using a *.ingest.critterciscm.com certificate\n\nThe latter URL appears to be a third party app analytics company. I've yet to receive an executive order to authorize blocking, but I believe tboire is likely correct that blocking the Niantic URL will prevent connections. Should I get approval to block, that is my next course of action.\n\nThanks everyone.\n\nHi @aelmore @tboire @BenjAudy.MTL\n\nI know I am late in this thread, but I wanted to share this two options with you all.\n\nOption 1: URL filtering\n\nSimply blacklist the following url: pgorelease.nianticlabs.com (this is used to make API calls by the APP)\n\nOption 2: Create a custom application which looks for the SNI string\n\nset application pokemon-go default port tcp/443\n\nset application pokemon-go signature PG-SSL and-condition \"And Condition 1\" or-condition \"Or Condition 1\" operator pattern-match pattern pgorelease.nianticlabs.com\n\nset application pokemon-go signature PG-SSL and-condition \"And Condition 1\" or-condition \"Or Condition 1\" operator pattern-match context ssl-req-client-hello\n\nset application pokemon-go signature PG-SSL scope protocol-data-unit\n\nset application pokemon-go signature PG-SSL order-free no\n\nset application pokemon-go signature PG-SSL comment â€œPattern match against the SNI for Pokemon Go\"\n\nset application pokemon-go category media\n\nset application pokemon-go subcategory gaming\n\nset application pokemon-go technology client-server\n\nset application pokemon-go description \"Pokemon Go is a social game released in 2016 by Niantic Labs.\"\n\nset application pokemon-go risk 1\n\nset application pokemon-go parent-app ssl"
