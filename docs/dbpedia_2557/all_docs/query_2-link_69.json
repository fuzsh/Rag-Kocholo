Using gaussian splatting, photogrammetry, and LiDAR (when available), it builds 3D models with high fidelity and stunning detail.\n\nJust point and scan. Scaniverse will take care of the rest. Our reconstruction algorithms create textured 3D models or splats on modern iOS and Android devices.\n\nMake your models shine with our intuitive editing controls. Crop and rotate your scans. Adjust exposure, contrast, and sharpness — it’s just like editing a photo.\n\nShare scans for friends and family to view in AR — or post to Sketchfab for the world to see. Export to 3D formats such as OBJ and FBX for compatibility with most 3D modeling software and game engines."
