Some call this the Mirrorworld or AR Cloud.\n\n6D.ai is now part of the Niantic Real World Platform team working to offer developers the ability to incorporate the real world into their products. Niantic’s leading research and engineering teams are working to build spatial computing technologies for better AR experiences, with millions of players contributing points of interest to the 3D map of the world.\n\nTo get on the list for private access to Niantic’s AR Platform, please apply to the Niantic Creator Program."
