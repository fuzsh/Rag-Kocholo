        "text": "The chief executive of the company behind smartphone game Pokemon Go will testify before the Senate Commerce Committee next week as part of a hearing on augmented reality (AR) technologies.\n\nNiantic, Inc.’s chief executive, John Hanke, will be joined at the Wednesday hearing by other industry representatives and University of Washington law professor Ryan Calo.\n\n{mosads}“Stretching far beyond entertainment, augmented reality is starting to be used today for transportation safety, scientific research, communication, and other real-world tasks,” said Chairman John Thune (R-S.D) in a statement.\n\n“Expert witnesses testifying at the first congressional hearing on augmented reality will introduce to the committee the potential applications and policy considerations of this rapidly-developing technology.”\n\nUnlike virtual reality, which uses technology to create a totally immersive experience for viewers, augmented reality adds a digital layer to images taken from the real world. Virtual- and augmented-reality technology has become a fixation of many major firms, including Facebook and Google.\n\nThe hearing will “examine the emergence, benefits, and implications” of the AR technology, according to the committee.\n\nAugmented reality remains a nascent technology. But some policymakers have already raised concerns about Pokemon Go, which allows its users to hunt for virtual Pokemon in the real world.\n\nIn July, Sen. Al Franken (D-Minn.) asked Niantic to provide him with information about the privacy features of the game.\n\n“As the augmented reality market evolves, I ask that you provide greater clarity on how Niantic is addressing issues of user privacy and security, particularly that of its younger players,” he said in a letter to Hanke."
