I'm not sure if emails are making it to a person, or just going straight to an auto-generated response inbox.\n\nMy account was hacked, and I provided proof of the *** to the support team, but received no response. Since my account was hacked, I have also been trying to get a refund for upcoming event tickets that I have bought. Again, no response.\n\nCustomer support is very poor, which reflects that the company is only there to make money and does not care about its consumer base. It's a poor model for a company!\n\nI had my account stolen , I have contacted you many times through many different methods and im just getting ignored in niantic support ..I need help sorting it.. and you just don't care and not interested..\n\nvery poor customer support .. they just ignore you and don't respond\n\nThey had stated they won't help recover my account..\n\nit's disgusting how they allow stolen accounts to be used and not help people recover them . Niantic don't care in the slightest all they care about is profit..\n\nCustomer service number not working. Facebook log in does not work.\n\nIt fails to log in. I have recovered the account multiple times. Yet still fails to log in. Username 5hlaaron, I started back near the start of Pok√©mon go.\n\nI have spent hundreds of dollars. I just want to recover so I can play with my whole family again. I have followed all your steps and this does not work.\n\nCan we change this to my gmail? Aaronraabe@***.com?"
