        "text": "An Ordinary Atrocity: Sharpeville and its Massacre by Philip Frankel\n\nCall Number: Olin Library DT1941 .F73 2001\n\nOn 21 March 1960 police opened fire on members of the Pan Africanist Congress (PAC) protesting peacefully in the South African township of Sharpeville against apartheid's iniquitous 'pass laws'. Sixty-nine people died, many shot in the back. The shots fired that day in an obscure corner of South Africa reverberated around the world and Sharpeville became the symbol of the evil of the apartheid system.\n\nBlack South Africa Explodes\n\nCall Number: Africana Library DT763 .C85 1977b\n\nThis book provides a narrative on the uprising in Soweto in 1976, when school children protested being taught in Afrikaans, the language of their oppressor. Hector Pieterson, a thirteen year old school boy who was shot in the back by a white policeman. would become the first casualty of the uprising. Among the strengths of the book is the timeline of events.\n\nSoweto: Life and Struggles of a South African Township by V. P. Gorodnov\n\nCall Number: Olin Library DT2400.S68 G67 1988\n\nThis book is about Soweto (South Western Townships) and its inhabitants. V.P. Gorodnov traces and exposes the roots of the fight against apartheid. In Afrikaans apartheid means “separation”, but a literal translation rather obscures than reveals its true meaning. Apartheid did not merely separate races; it institutionalized a system of oppression, thereby enabling one race to rule another. It is against this background that the 1976 Soweto uprisings happened, and this book attends to provide a historical overview which led to that uprising.\n\nLast Grave at Dimbaza\n\nCall Number: Africana Library Video 690\n\nShot illegally in the Republic of South Africa, this documentary exposes the oppression of Blacks and other people designated as colored under apartheid rule in South Africa. Filmed throughout South Africa, from Capetown to Johannesburg, as well as in the surrounding Black townships and the desolate bantustans, this film visually portrays the stark contracts between living and working conditions for the 18 million Blacks and the 4 million Whites who ruled over them.\n\nRFK in the Land of Apartheid: A Ripple of Hope\n\nCall Number: Africana Library Videodisc 594\n\nUsing never before seen archival footage and interviews in South Africa and the United States, filmmakers ... tell the unknown story of Robert Kennedy's 1966 visit to South Africa during the worst years of Apartheid. The film evokes the connections between the American Civil Rights Movement and the Anti-Apartheid Movement in South Africa. The filmmakers find witness to this special moment in time through the sights and sounds of present day South Africa.\n\nAnatomy of a Miracle: The End of Apartheid and the Birth of the New South Africa by Patti Waldmeir\n\nCall Number: Olin Library 967 .W35x 1997\n\nThe peaceful birth of Black majority rule in South Africa was a transcendent moment. Many South Africans believe this negotiated revolution to be a miracle: at the very least it was a feat of political magic. One false step along the way could have ignited the race war that had been widely predicted as South Africa's destiny.\n\nThe Rise and Fall of Apartheid by David John Welsh\n\nCall Number: Africana Library DT 1757 .W45 2009\n\nIn The Rise and Fall of Apartheid, David Welsh views the topic against the backdrop of a long history of conflict spanning apartheid’s rise and demise, and the liberation movement’s suppression and subsequent resurrection. His view is that the movement away from apartheid to majority rule would have taken far longer and been much bloodier were it not for the changes undergone by Afrikaner nationalism itself. There were turning points, such as the Soweto Uprising of 1976, but few believed that the transition from white domination to inclusive democracy would occur as soon—and as relatively peacefully—as it did. In effect, however, a multitude of different factors led the African National Congress and the National Party to see that neither side could win the conflict on its own terms. Utterly dissimilar in background, culture, beliefs, and political style, Nelson Mandela and F. W. de Klerk were an unlikely pair of liberators. But both soon recognized that they were dependent on each other to steer the transformation process through to its conclusion.\n\nUnderstanding Apartheid- Learners Book (Online) by Apartheid Museum; Mary Monteith\n\nWritten by Mary Monteith of the Apartheid Museum in South Africa. This book is divided into five chapters. Each chapter focuses on a different aspect of apartheid. The book encourages you to go on a journey of understanding from the tortured history of South Africa's past to the hope for the future that the democratic elections of the 1994 offered."
