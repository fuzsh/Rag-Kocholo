        "text": "A timeline of the 95-year life of Nelson Rolihlahla Mandela – revolutionary, soldier, political prisoner, president of South Africa, statesman and global icon of social justice.\n\nREAD MORE: Nelson Mandela’s family tree\n\nJump to:\n\n1910s\n\n18 July 1918 – Nelson Mandela born in Mvezo, Eastern Cape province, South Africa. His mother, Nonqaphi Fanny Nosekeni, is one of four wives of his father, Mphakanyiswa Gadla Henry Mandela, a “chief by both blood and custom“.\n\nHis birth name is Rolihlahla. In isiXhosa it literally translates as “pulling the branch of a tree”. But colloquially, it means “troublemaker“.\n\n1920s\n\n1925 – Mandela begins primary school near his home village of Qunu.\n\nHis teacher, Miss Mdingane, gives him the English name “Nelson”. The apocryphal story is that she was unable to pronounce “Rolihlahla”. But Miss Mdingane, given her surname, was probably able to pronounce isiXhosa names.\n\nIn his autobiography Long Walk to Freedom, Mandela wrote: “On the first day of school, my teacher, Miss Mdingane, gave each of us an English name and said that from thenceforth that was the name we would answer to in school. This was the custom among Africans in those days and was undoubtedly due to the British bias of our education.”\n\nAnother story is that the teacher named him “Nelson” after British Navy admiral Horatio Nelson, hero of the Battle of Trafalgar.\n\nThe Nelson Mandela Foundation says it’s “unclear why Miss Mdingane chose the name ‘Nelson’“.\n\nMandela wrote: “That day, Miss Mdingane told me that my new name was Nelson. Why she bestowed this particular name upon me I have no idea. Perhaps it had something to do with the great British sea captain Lord Nelson, but that would be only a guess.”\n\n1930s\n\n1930 – Mandela’s father Mphakanyiswa Gadla Henry Mandela dies. In his autobiography Mandela recalls his father dying when he was nine. He was 12.\n\nMandela becomes the ward of the Thembu regent, paramount chief Jongintaba Dalindyebo.\n\n1934 – At the age of 16, Mandela undergoes the Xhosa initiation and circumcision ritual.

He would only be free again in 1990, 28 years later.\n\n25 October 1962 – Mandela is convicted of unlawfully exiting the country and incitement to strike.

It is an ideal for which I hope to live for and to see realised. But my lord, if it needs be, it is an ideal for which I am prepared to die.”\n\nListen to the final 90 seconds of the speech:\n\n12 June 1964 – The Rivonia Trial ends with Mandela and all his co-accused – except Rusty Bernstein – being found guilty and sentenced to life imprisonment.
