        "text": "Full Name: Winnie Madikizela-Mandela\n\nProfession: Anti-Apartheid Activist and Politician\n\nBiography: A controversial figure in South African history and a staunch anti-apartheid activist, Winnie Madikizela married Nelson Mandela in 1958. When he was sent to prison in 1963 after the Riviona Trial, she became the public face of Mandela through his 27 years imprisonment. On numerous occasions she was arrested, tortured and exiled.\n\nHer image was damaged in the 1980s after it emerged that she had been involved in kidnapping, torture and murder by members of her security detail known as the 'Mandela United Football Club.'\n\nAfter Nelson Mandela was released in 1990, their marriage quickly ended, and they were divorced in 1996. Winnie Mandela died at age 81 in 2018.\n\nBorn: September 26, 1936\n\nBirthplace: Bizana, Pondoland, South Africa\n\nGeneration: Silent Generation\n\nChinese Zodiac: Rat\n\nStar Sign: Libra"
