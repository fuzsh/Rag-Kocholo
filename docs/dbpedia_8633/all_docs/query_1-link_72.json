        "text": "A symbol of the struggle to end minority rule in South Africa\n\nShe was also accused of ‘gross violations of human rights’\n\nWinnie Madikizela-Mandela , whose reputation as a hero of the fight to end white-minority rule in South Africa was tainted by kidnapping and fraud convictions, has died. She was 81.\n\nThe former wife of Nelson Mandela died in Johannesburg on Monday after a long illness, a family spokesman said in a statement. Her marriage to Mandela in 1958 thrust her onto center stage of South African politics, and she emerged as a symbol of the struggle to end apartheid while her husband was serving a 27-year jail term for treason. The security forces subjected her to constant harassment, detention and a nine-year banishment to a tiny rural town."
