        "text": "Winnie Madikizela-Mandela, whose hallowed place in the pantheon of South Africa's liberators was eroded by scandal over corruption, kidnapping, murder and the adulterous implosion of her fabled marriage to Nelson Mandela, died early Monday in Johannesburg. She was 81.\n\nHer death, at the Netcare Milpark Hospital, was announced by her spokesman, Victor Dlamini. He said in a statement that she died \"after a long illness, for which she had been in and out of hospital since the start of the year.\"\n\nThe South African Broadcasting Corp. said she was admitted to the hospital over the weekend complaining of the flu after she attended a church service Friday. She had been treated for diabetes and underwent major surgeries as her health began failing over the past several years.\n\nCharming, intelligent, complex, fiery and eloquent, Madikizela-Mandela (Madikizela was her surname at birth) was inevitably known to most of the world through her marriage to the revered Mandela. It was a bond that endured ambiguously: She derived a vaunted status from their shared struggle, yet she chafed at being defined by him.\n\nPREVIOUS COVERAGE: Nelson Mandela, South Africa's freedom fighter, dies at age 95\n\nMadikizela-Mandela commanded a natural constituency of her own among South Africa's poor and dispossessed, and the post-apartheid leaders who followed Mandela could never ignore her appeal to a broad segment of society. In April 2016, the government of President Jacob Zuma gave Madikizela-Mandela one of the country's highest honors: the Order of Luthuli, given, in part, for contributions to the struggle for democracy.\n\nMadikizela-Mandela retained a political presence as a member of Parliament, representing the dominant African National Congress, and she insisted on a kind of primacy in Mandela's life, no matter their estrangement.\n\n\"Nobody knows him better than I do,\" she told a British interviewer in 2013.\n\nIncreasingly, though, Madikizela-Mandela resented the notion that her anti-apartheid credentials had been eclipsed by her husband's global stature and celebrity, and she struggled in vain in later years to be regarded again as the \"mother of the nation,\" a sobriquet acquired during the long years of Mandela's imprisonment. She insisted that her contribution had been wrongly depicted as a pale shadow of his.\n\n\"I am not Mandela's product,\" she told an interviewer. \"I am the product of the masses of my country and the product of my enemy\" — references to South Africa's white rulers under apartheid and to her burning hatred of them, rooted in her own years of mistreatment, incarceration and banishment.\n\nConduit to her husband\n\nWhile Mandela was held at the Robben Island penal settlement, off Cape Town, where he spent most of his 27 years in jail, Madikizela-Mandela acted as the main conduit to his followers, who hungered for every clue to his thinking and well-being. The flow of information was meager, however: Her visits there were rare, and she was never allowed physical contact with him.\n\nIn time, her reputation became scarred by accusations of extreme brutality toward suspected turncoats, misbehavior and indiscretion in her private life, and a radicalism that seemed at odds with Mandela's quest for racial inclusiveness.\n\nShe nevertheless sought to remain in his orbit. She was at his side, brandishing a victor's clenched fist salute, when he was finally released from prison in February 1990.\n\nAt his funeral, in December 2013, she appeared by his coffin in mourning black — positioning herself almost as if she were the grieving first lady — even though Mandela had married Graça Machel, the widow of the former Mozambican President Samora Machel, in 1998, on his 80th birthday, six years after separating from Madikizela-Mandela and two years after their divorce. It was Mandela's third marriage.\n\nIn 2016, Madikizela-Mandela began legal efforts to secure the ownership of Mandela's home in his ancestral village of Qunu. She contended that their marriage had never been lawfully dissolved and that she was therefore entitled to the house, which Mandela had bequeathed to his descendants. High Court judges rejected that argument in April. After learning that she had lost the case, she was hospitalized.\n\nHer lawyers said she would appeal the High Court judgment.\n\n'She Who Must Endure'\n\nNomzamo Winifred Zanyiwe Madikizela was born to a noble family of the Xhosa-speaking Pondo tribe in Transkei. Her first name, Nomzamo, means \"she who must endure trials.\"\n\nHer birth date was Sept. 26, 1936, according to the Nelson Mandela Foundation and many other sources, although earlier accounts gave the year as 1934.\n\nHer father, Columbus, was a senior official in the so-called homeland of Transkei, according to South African History Online, an unofficial archive, which described her as the fourth of eight children. (Other accounts say her family was larger.) Her mother, Gertrude, was a teacher who died when Winnie was 8, the archive said.\n\nAs a barefoot child she tended cattle and learned to make do with very little, in marked contrast to her later years of free-spending ostentation. She attended a Methodist mission school and then the Hofmeyr School of Social Work in Johannesburg, where she befriended Adelaide Tsukudu, the future wife of Oliver Tambo, a law partner of Mandela's who went on to lead the ANC in exile. She turned down a scholarship in the United States, preferring to remain in South Africa as the first black social worker at the Baragwanath hospital in Soweto.\n\nOne day in 1957, when she was waiting at a bus stop, Mandela drove past.\n\n\"I was struck by her beauty,\" he wrote in his autobiography, Long Walk to Freedom. Some weeks later, he recalled, \"I was at the office when I popped in to see Oliver and there was this same young woman.\"\n\nMandela, approaching 40 and the father of three, declared on their first date that he would marry her. Soon he separated from his first wife, Evelyn Ntoko Mase, a nurse, to marry Madikizela-Mandela on June 14, 1958.\n\nMadikizela-Mandela was thrust into the limelight in 1964 when her husband was sentenced to life in prison on charges of treason. She was officially \"banned\" under draconian restrictions intended to make her a nonperson, unable to work, socialize, move freely or be quoted in the South African news media, even as she raised their two daughters, Zenani and Zindziswa.\n\nIn a crackdown in May 1969, five years after her husband was sent to prison, she was arrested and held for 17 months, 13 in solitary confinement. She was beaten and tortured. The experience, she wrote, was \"what changed me, what brutalized me so much that I knew what it is to hate.\"\n\nAfter blacks rioted in the segregated Johannesburg township of Soweto in 1976, Madikizela-Mandela was again imprisoned without trial, this time for five months. She was then banished to a bleak township outside the profoundly conservative white town of Brandfort, in the Orange Free State.\n\n\"I am a living symbol of whatever is happening in the country,\" she wrote in Part of My Soul Went With Him, a memoir published in 1984 and printed around the world. \"I am a living symbol of the white man's fear. I never realized how deeply embedded this fear is until I came to Brandfort.\"\n\nContrary to the authorities' intentions, her cramped home became a place of pilgrimage for diplomats and prominent sympathizers, as well as foreign journalists seeking interviews.\n\nMadikizela-Mandela cherished conversation with outsiders and word of the world beyond her confines. She scorned many of her restrictions, using whites-only public phones and ignoring the segregated counters at the local liquor store when she ordered Champagne ? gestures that stunned the area's whites.\n\nBanishment took toll\n\nStill, Madikizela-Mandela's exclusion from what passed as a normal life in South Africa took a toll, and she began to drink heavily. During her banishment, moreover, her land changed. Beginning in late 1984, young protesters challenged the authorities with increasing audacity. The unrest spread, prompting the white rulers to acknowledge what they called a \"revolutionary climate\" and declare a state of emergency.\n\nWhen Madikizela-Mandela returned to her home in Soweto in 1985, breaking her banning orders, it was as a far more bellicose figure, determined to assume leadership of what became the decisive and most violent phase of the struggle. As she saw it, her role was to stiffen the confrontation with the authorities.\n\nThe tactics were harsh.\n\n\"Together, hand in hand, with our boxes of matches and our necklaces, we will liberate this country,\" she told a rally in April 1986.\n\nShe was referring to \"necklacing,\" a form of sometimes arbitrary execution by fire using a gas-soaked tire around a supposed traitor's neck, and it shocked an older generation of anti-apartheid campaigners. But her severity aligned her with the young township radicals who enforced commitment to the struggle.\n\nIn the late 1980s, Madikizela-Mandela allowed the outbuildings around her residence in Soweto to be used by the so-called Mandela United Football Club, a vigilante gang that claimed to be her bodyguards. It terrorized Soweto, inviting infamy and prosecution.\n\nIn 1991 she was convicted of ordering the 1988 kidnapping of four youths in Soweto. The body of one, a 14-year-old named James Moeketsi Seipei ? nicknamed Stompie, a slang word for a cigarette butt, reflecting his diminutive stature ? was found with his throat cut.\n\nMadikizela-Mandela's chief bodyguard was convicted of murder. She was sentenced to six years for kidnapping, but South Africa's highest appeals court reduced her punishment to fines and a suspended one-year term.\n\nBy then her life had begun to unravel. The United Democratic Front, an umbrella group of organizations fighting apartheid and linked to the ANC, expelled her. In April 1992, Mandela, midway through settlement talks with President F.W. de Klerk of South Africa, announced that he and his wife were separating. (She dismissed suggestions that she had wanted to be known by the title \"first lady.\" \"I am not the sort of person to carry beautiful flowers and be an ornament to everyone,\" she said.)\n\nTwo years later, Mandela was elected president and offered her a minor job as the deputy minister of arts, culture, science and technology. But after allegations of influence peddling, bribe taking and misuse of government funds, she was forced from office. In 1996, Mandela ended their 38-year marriage, testifying in court that his wife was having an affair with a colleague.\n\nOnly in 1997, at the behest of Archbishop Desmond Tutu at South Africa's Truth and Reconciliation Commission, did Madikizela-Mandela offer an apology for the events of the late 1980s.\n\n\"Things went horribly wrong,\" she said, adding, \"For that I am deeply sorry.\"\n\nYet the catalog of missteps continued, cast into sharp relief by her haughty dismissiveness toward her accusers. In 2003 she was convicted of using her position as president of the ANC Women's League to obtain fraudulent loans; she was sentenced to five years in prison. But her sentence was again suspended on appeal, with a judge finding that she had not gained personally from the transactions.\n\nTo the end, Madikizela-Mandela remained a polarizing figure in South Africa, admired by loyalists who were prepared to focus on her contribution to ending apartheid, vilified by critics who foremost saw her flaws. Few could ignore her unsettling contradictions, however.\n\n\"While there is something of a historical revisionism happening in some quarters of our nation these days that brands Nelson Mandela's second wife a revolutionary and heroic figure,\" the columnist Verashni Pillay wrote in the South African newspaper the Mail and Guardian, \"it doesn't take that much digging to remember the truly awful things she has been responsible for.\""
