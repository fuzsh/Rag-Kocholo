        "text": "South African anti-apartheid activist Winnie Madikizela-Mandela has died on Easter Monday at the age of 81.\n\nNelson Mandela's ex-wife passed away peacefully following a long illness, a family spokesperson said.\n\nEarlier this year, Ms Madikizela-Mandela was hospitalized for a kidney ailment and exhaustion, and had also been in and out of hospital since 2016 for back and knee surgery.\n\nScroll down for video\n\nShe was admitted to a Johannesburg hospital in January, after complaining of a 'loss of appetite' and that 'one of her legs was painful'.\n\n'She died after a long illness, for which she had been in and out of hospital since the start of the year,' family spokesperson Victor Dlamini said in a statement.\n\n'She succumbed peacefully in the early hours of Monday afternoon surrounded by her family and loved ones.\n\n'She fought valiantly against the apartheid state and sacrificed her life for the freedom of the country,' the statement said.\n\n'She kept the memory of her imprisoned husband Nelson Mandela alive during his years on Robben Island and helped give the struggle for justice in South Africa one its most recognisable faces.'\n\nRetired South African archbishop and Nobel laureate Desmond Tutu hailed the late Winnie Mandela, who died on Monday, as 'a defining symbol of the struggle against apartheid'.\n\n'She refused to be bowed by the imprisonment of her husband, the perpetual harassment of her family by security forces, detentions, bannings and banishment,' he said.\n\n'Her courageous defiance was deeply inspirational to me, and to generations of activists.'\n\nSouth African President Cyril Ramaphosa was also among those to pay tribute Winnie Mandela.\n\nHe said she was the 'voice of defiance and resistance' against white-minority rule.\n\n'In the face of exploitation, she was a champion of justice and equality,' he said in a televised address, adding that she 'was an abiding symbol of the desire of our people to be free'\n\nMs Madikizela-Mandela married Nelson Mandela in 1958, four years before he was imprisoned for his fight against apartheid in 1962, and they had two children together.\n\nDuring her ex-husband's 27-year imprisonment, Ms Madikizela-Mandela campaigned for his release and the rights of black South Africans.\n\nShe became a symbol for the anti-apartheid struggle, undergoing arrest and banishment herself, but her political activism was marred by a kidnapping and assault conviction in 1991, for which she was fined.\n\nShe walked side-by-side with her husband upon his 1990 release, and as he became South Africa's president in the first post-apartheid elections, he appointed her Deputy Minister of Arts, Culture, Science and Technology in 1994.\n\nIn 1996, Mandela divorced her and fired her from his government, but she kept his name and remained close to her ex-husband until his death in December, 2013.\n\nAfter a 2003 conviction for fraud, she later rehabilitated her political career winning a seat in parliament in 2009 elections.\n\nBut her bitterness emerged in 2010 newspaper interview, saying: 'Mandela let us down. He agreed to a bad deal for the blacks.'\n\nShe also called Tutu a 'cretin' and the reconciliation process a 'charade', though she later claimed the quotes were never meant to be published.\n\nDespite it all, she was a regular visitor travelling from Soweto - where she still lived - to Mandela's bedside in his final months, and she said she was present when he died.\n\nHe did not leave her anything in his will.\n\nJust last month, she was shown in television footage joking with Cyril Ramaphosa, the newly-appointed president who paid a courtesy call at her home in Soweto, the township where she lived for decades.\n\nDressed in full ANC colours of yellow, black and green, she asked Ramaphosa, who is known for his morning runs, 'Why don't you get tired?'\n\n'We can't get tired when you have given us work to do'' Ramaphosa said, paying fulsome praise to her appearance.\n\nShe had also expressed support for the current leadership of the ANC (African National Congress) party - which her husband led to power in the euphoric post-apartheid elections of 1994.\n\nWho was Winnie Mandela? Activist dubbed the 'Mother of the Nation' whose career was mired in scandal\n\nWinnie Mandela was a highly controversial figure in South African politics, revered by many as the Mother of the Nation, but often dogged by scandal.\n\nBorn Nomzamo Winifred Zanyiwe Madikizela in 1939 in the village of Bizana, Transkei district, she was the daughter of a history teacher and a science teacher.\n\nIn 1953, on the advice of her father, she moved to Johannesburg to study at the Jan Hofmeyr School of Social Work - a rarity for a black woman at the time - where Mandela was the patron.\n\nWinnie Mandela was a social worker before she married Nelson in 1958 and turned instead to a life of activism, helping to end apartheid\n\nShe graduated in 1956 at the top of her class and was offered a scholarship to study in the US, but turned it down in order to become the first qualified social worker at Johannesburg's Baragwanath Hospital.\n\nIt was during her work here that she first became political as she witnessed first-hand the effect apartheid was having on poor black communities.\n\nWinnie first met Mandela in 1957 at a bus stop in Soweto while he was still married to his first wife, Evelyn Mase.\n\nTheir relationship was falling apart, however, and they divorced in 1958. A short time later Mandela and Winnie tied the knot.\n\nWinnie spent 38 years married to Nelson, 27 of which were spent apart, separated from him in 1992 and divorced in 1996\n\nMandela was already a well-known political figure by this time, and their marriage - particularly the 16-year age gap between them - made the news.\n\nWhile her husband was hounded by the government, Winnie began social action of her own, taking part in a protest against laws which restricted the movements of blacks in white areas.\n\nWinnie, along with several other activists, was arrested and decided to spend two weeks in jail without posting bail as a further protest, despite being pregnant with her first child at the time.\n\nThis also marked the first activism she had taken part in away from her husband's shadow.\n\nIn 1964 Mandela was jailed for life for his activism and the government began hounding Winnie in an attempt to demoralise him.\n\nGovernment security forces tortured her, tried locking her up, confined her to Johannesburg's Soweto township, and then banished her to the desolate town of Brandfort, where her house was bombed twice.\n\nShe was allowed to visit her husband in prison rarely, and they were always divided by a glass screen.\n\nThroughout the height of apartheid, Winnie remained at the forefront of the struggle, urging students in the 1976 Soweto uprising to 'fight to the end'.\n\nBut in the 1980s, the militant-martyr began to be seen as a liability for Mandela and the liberation movement.\n\nShe had surrounded herself with a band of vigilante bodyguards called the Mandela United Football Club, who earned a terrifying reputation for violence.\n\nWinnie was widely linked to 'necklacing', when suspected traitors were burnt alive using a petrol-soaked car tyre being which was put over their head and set alight.\n\nHer notoriety was reinforced by a speech in 1986 when she declared that 'with our boxes of matches and our necklaces we shall liberate this country.'\n\nMandela was released from jail in 1990 and completed his 'long walk to freedom' with Winnie at his side.\n\nHowever, the couple soon ran into martial difficulties that were complicated when she was convicted in 1991 over the kidnapping and murder of Stompie Moeketsi, a 14-year-old boy.\n\nMoeketsi, who was accused being an informer, was murdered by her bodyguards in 1989. She was initially jailed for kidnapping and assault, but her sentence was reduced to a fine.\n\nWinnie and Mandela separated in 1992 amid rumors that Winnie was having an affair with one of her bodyguards and divorced in 1996.\n\nWinnie denied involvement in any murders when she appeared before Archbishop Desmond Tutu at the Truth and Reconciliation Commission hearings.\n\n'She was a tremendous stalwart of our struggle, and icon of liberation - something went wrong, horribly, badly wrong,' Tutu said as damning testimony implicated her.\n\nWinnie was convicted in 1991 over the kidnap and murder of a 14-year-old boy, and in 2003 was convicted again for fraud\n\nShe served as a deputy minister in President Mandela's government, but was sacked for insubordination and eased out of the top ranks of the ruling party.\n\nAfter a 2003 conviction for fraud, she later rehabilitated her political career winning a seat in parliament in 2009 elections.\n\nBut her bitterness emerged in 2010 newspaper interview, saying: 'Mandela let us down. He agreed to a bad deal for the blacks.'\n\nShe also called Tutu a 'cretin' and the reconciliation process a 'charade', though she later claimed the quotes were never meant to be published\n\nDespite it all, she was a regular visitor travelling from Soweto - where she still lived - to Mandela's bedside in his final months, and she said she was present when he died.\n\nHe did not leave her anything in his will.\n\nAt her lavish 80th birthday party in Cape Town, Madikizela-Mandela wore a sparkling white dress and beamed with pleasure as she was lauded by guests that included senior politicians from rival parties.\n\n'Mama Winnie has lived a rich and eventful life, whose victories and setbacks have traced the progress of the struggle of our people for freedom,' then vice president Cyril Ramaphosa, who is now president, told guests.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn the UK, political figures joined the army of those paying tribute to the late former wife of South Africa's most famous leader.\n\nFormer cabinet minister Lord Hain said: 'She suffered so much bringing up her two girls when Nelson Mandela was in prison: beaten up, banned, banished to remote Brandfort, harassed, imprisoned.”\n\nDescribing her as 'fearless and defiant in the face of the apartheid state', he added: 'Remember that when correctly criticising her rogue later life.'\n\nDiane Abbott said: 'I will never forget the image of Winnie walking hand in hand with Nelson Mandela when he was finally released from prison in February 1990.\n\n'She had campaigned for 27 long years for his release.\n\n'Nobody can deny her extraordinary courage and that, for poor black South Africans, she remains a heroine.”\n\nLabour MP David Lammy said: 'In the those desperate years of apartheid when Nelson Mandela and so many anti-apartheid heroes were locked up on Robben Island, we looked to Winnie who fought fearlessly as a defiant voice for the voiceless and a free South Africa.'"
