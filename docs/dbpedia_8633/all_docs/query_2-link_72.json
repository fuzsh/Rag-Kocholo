        "text": "Winnie Madikizela-Mandela, who spent most of her life fighting for racial equality in South Africa, has died at the age of 81, the BBC reports. A statement released by Madikizela-Mandela's family to news outlets confirmed she had \"succumbed peacefully in the early hours of Monday afternoon surrounded by her family and loved ones\" in Johannesburg, following a long battle with an illness that had her in and out of hospitals in recent months. According to CNN, the statement continued, \"Mrs. Madikizela-Mandela was one of the greatest icons of the struggle against apartheid. She fought valiantly against the apartheid state and sacrificed her life for the freedom of the country.\"\n\nMadikizela-Mandela was married to the late South African President Nelson Mandela for nearly 40 years, including the 27 years he was imprisoned on an island near Cape Town, South Africa, for his anti-apartheid efforts. They divorced in 1996. Though many people know Mandela's work, Madikizela-Mandela was a dedicated activist in her own right. During her husband's time in prison, she became an \"international symbol of resistance to apartheid,\" according to the BBC.\n\nMadikizela-Mandela remained politically active throughout her life. CNN reports that Madikizela-Mandela, an outspoken member of the African National Congress political party, \"was a member of South Africa's parliament at the time of her death.\"\n\nSince Monday's announcement, many have expressed their sadness over Madikizela-Mandela's passing and their admiration for her work, including members of the African National Congress, who said in a statement to the BBC, \"With the departure of Mama Winnie, [we have lost] one of the very few who are left of our stalwarts and icons. She was one of those who would tell us exactly what is wrong and right, and we are going to be missing that guidance.\" Meanwhile, Johannesburg's mayor, Herman Mashaba, tweeted, \"My deepest condolences to the Mandela Family for the passing away of the mother of our nation, Winnie Mandela. She served our nation with distinction . May her soul Rest In Peace.\""
