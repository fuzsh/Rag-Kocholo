        "text": "Her traditional name was Nomzamo — \"she who tries\". But, she was known universally as Winnie.\n\nWinnie Madikizela was born on September 26, 1936, in South Africa's Transkei region.\n\nShe died on Monday in a Johannesburg hospital at the age of 81 after a long illness.\n\nHer parents Columbus and Gertrude were school teachers and filled her with the importance of education.\n\nAs a young woman, she graduated from university and became a social worker, advocating for patients and families at Baragwanath Hospital.\n\nA chance meeting at a Soweto bus stop in 1957 changed the course of her life.\n\nShe caught the attention of a young lawyer and activist, Nelson Mandela.\n\nThe couple fell in love and married the following year.\n\nIt was a meeting of minds and politics.\n\nThe Mandelas had two daughters, Zenani and Zindzi.\n\nBut, home life was pierced and distorted by the anti-apartheid struggle.\n\nNelson Mandela was sent to prison in 1963.\n\nDetained, beaten, arrested and exiled\n\nIn his absence, Mrs Mandela, as she was then known, was not only a single parent, but a vocal activist.\n\nShe was repeatedly detained, beaten, arrested and exiled.\n\nShe spent 18 months in solitary confinement for her role in the African National Congress (ANC).\n\nLetters to her husband in prison on Robben Island were heavily censored — sentences cut out with razor blades, other words hidden under thick black ink.\n\nThe children grew up with few memories of their father, but with constant reminders of his status as an enemy of the state.\n\nThe Mandela home in Soweto is still scarred by bullet marks on the front porch from shots fired by the security forces during the height of apartheid.\n\nWinnie Mandela did not spend her time quietly waiting for her husband's release.\n\nShe became a vocal, steely member of the ANC.\n\nIn 1986, she delivered a controversial speech supporting violence against the ANC's enemies, including the use of \"necklacing\" — burning a victim to death with a tyre full of fuel around their neck.\n\nHer security team, known as the Mandela United Football Club became infamous for dispensing township justice.\n\nMrs Mandela was convicted of involvement in the kidnapping of a 14-year-old boy, who was found dead in 1989.\n\nThe South African Truth and Reconciliation Commission would later find Mrs Mandela politically and morally accountable for gross violations of human rights.\n\nMandelas raise their fists in celebration, defiance\n\nIn 1990, Mandela was released after 27 years in prison.\n\nHe walked free, holding hands with Winnie.\n\nThe pair raised their fists to the crowd, in celebration and defiance.\n\nBut, the reunion was not simple.\n\nThe couple that was married in 1958 had changed, along with the nation they were fighting for.\n\nMandela had been transformed from young activist, to unseen inmate and then to the pinnacle of international acclaim.\n\nThe demands of reconnecting with his family were overshadowed by the challenges of transforming the nation to democracy in time for elections.\n\nThe former prisoner became president in 1994.\n\nA political leader in her own right\n\nMrs Mandela had undergone an evolution of her own.\n\nShe was a political leader in her own right and shunned the expectations of becoming first lady.\n\nShe was appointed a Minister in the ANC government, but was removed less than a year later amid allegations of corruption.\n\nAll the while, the Mandelas' marriage was falling apart. The couple divorced in 1996.\n\nIn 2003, Winnie Madikizela-Mandela, as she then became known, was convicted of multiple counts of fraud and theft, all but one of the convictions was overturned on appeal the following year.\n\nMs Madikizela-Mandela continued her role as a senior figure in the ANC — revered by her supporters and watched carefully by her enemies.\n\nSome in the ANC thought she had tarnished her reputation, others put her years of struggle ahead of her convictions.\n\nBeyond her national and international profile, she maintained deep connections in Soweto and beyond.\n\nMany township families still have their own stories of \"Mama Winnie\" — an unpayable bill paid, a funeral attended, a promise kept, names remembered.\n\nThose who had nowhere else to go, would walk up to Mama Winnie's gate to seek help.\n\nThat is where she is remembered, somewhere between the international stage and the township streets.\n\nSomewhere between steadfast wife and fiercely independent activist.\n\nSomewhere between wronged and wrongful.\n\nWinnie Madikizela-Mandela was as turbulent and transformative as the times she lived in."
