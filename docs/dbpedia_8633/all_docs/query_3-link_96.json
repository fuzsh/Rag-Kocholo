        "text": "Her uncompromising methods and refusal to forgive contrasted sharply with the reconciliation espoused by Nelson Mandela as he worked to forge a stable, pluralistic democracy from the racial division and oppression of apartheid.\n\nThe contradiction helped kill their marriage and destroyed the esteem in which she was held by many South Africans, although she retained the support of radical black nationalists to the end.\n\nIn her twilight years, Madikizela-Mandela had frequent run-ins with authority that further undermined her reputation as a fighter against the white-minority regime that ran Africa’s most advanced economy from 1948 to 1994.\n\nDuring her husband’s 27-year incarceration, Madikizela-Mandela campaigned tirelessly for his release and for the rights of black South Africans, suffering years of detention, banishment and arrest by the white authorities.\n\nShe remained steadfast and unbowed throughout, emerging to punch the air triumphantly in the clenched-fist salute of black power as she walked hand in hand with Mandela out of Cape Town’s Victor Verster prison on February 11, 1990.\n\nFor husband and wife, it was a crowning moment that led four years later to the end of centuries of white domination when Mandela became South Africa’s first black president.\n\n‘HORRIBLY WRONG’\n\nBut for Madikizela-Mandela, the end of apartheid marked the start of a string of legal and political troubles that, accompanied by tales of her glamorous living, kept her in the spotlight for all the wrong reasons.\n\nAs evidence emerged in the dying years of apartheid of the brutality of her Soweto enforcers, the “Mandela United Football Club” (MUFC), her sobriquet switched from “Mother of the Nation” to “Mugger”.\n\nBlamed for the killing of activist Stompie Seipei, who was found near her Soweto home with his throat cut, she was convicted in 1991 of kidnapping and assaulting the 14-year-old because he was suspected of being an informer.\n\nHer six-year jail term was reduced on appeal to a fine.\n\nShe and Mandela separated in 1992 and her reputation slipped further when he dismissed her from his cabinet in 1995 after allegations of corruption.\n\nThe couple divorced a year later, after which she adopted the surname Madikizela-Mandela.\n\nAppearing at the Truth and Reconciliation Commission (TRC) set up to unearth atrocities committed by both sides in the anti-apartheid struggle, Madikizela-Mandela refused to show remorse for abductions and murders carried out in her name.\n\nOnly after pleading from anguished TRC chairman Archbishop Desmond Tutu did she admit grudgingly that “things went horribly wrong”.\n\nIn its final report, the TRC ruled that Madikizela-Mandela was “politically and morally accountable for the gross violations of human rights committed by the MUFC”.\n\nFour years later, she was back in court, facing fraud and theft charges in relation to an elaborate bank loan scheme.\n\n“Somewhere it seems that something went wrong,” magistrate Peet Johnson said as he sentenced her to five years in jail, later overturned on appeal. “You should set the example for all of us.”\n\nMARRIED TO THE STRUGGLE\n\nBorn on September 26, 1936, in Bizana, Eastern Cape province, Madikizela-Mandela became politicised at an early age in her job as a hospital social worker.\n\n“I started to realise the abject poverty under which most people were forced to live, the appalling conditions created by the inequalities of the system,” she once said.\n\nThe 22-year-old Winnie, whose given name, Nomzamo, means “one who strives”, caught the eye of Mandela at a Soweto bus stop in 1957, starting a whirlwind romance that led to their marriage a year later.\n\nBut with husband and wife pouring their energies into the fight against apartheid, the relationship struggled before being torn apart after six years when Mandela was arrested and sentenced to life in prison.\n\nMadikizela-Mandela later described her marriage as a sham and the birth of their two daughters, Zindzi and Zenani, as “quite coincidental” to her one true love – the struggle against white rule.\n\n“I was married to the ANC. It was the best marriage I ever had,” she often said.\n\nGraca Machel, who stepped into her shoes as South Africa’s first lady when she married Mandela in 1998, paid tribute to her predecessor in the years after her union.\n\n“It’s unfortunate that in our lives we don’t interact very easily, but I want to state very clearly that Winnie is my hero. Winnie is someone I respect highly,” Machel once said.\n\n‘I’M NOT SORRY’\n\nAs the years passed and Madikizela-Mandela’s public standing plummeted, her relationship with the party she loved soured. She bore the air of a troublemaker, arriving late at rallies and haranguing comrades, including Thabo Mbeki, Mandela’s successor as president.\n\nIn 2001, a television camera caught Mbeki brushing Madikizela-Mandela away and knocking off her hat after she arrived an hour late for a rally to commemorate a 1976 anti-apartheid uprising by Soweto schoolchildren and students.\n\nYears later, she clashed with the next president, Jacob Zuma, becoming a political patron of renegade ANC youth leader Julius Malema, who quit the century-old movement to found his own ultra-leftist political party.\n\nConfirming her support for Malema and his calls for seizure of white-owned farms and banks, Madikizela-Mandela revealed her contempt in 2010 for the deal her ex-husband struck with South Africa’s white minority nearly two decades before.\n\nIn a London newspaper interview, she attacked Mandela, who died in December 2013, saying he had gone soft in prison and sold out the black cause.\n\n“Mandela did go to prison and he went in there as a burning young revolutionary. But look what came out,” she said. “Mandela let us down. He agreed to a bad deal for the blacks.”\n\nShe also dismissed Tutu, post-apartheid South Africa’s moral fulcrum, as a “cretin” and rubbished his attempts at national healing as a “religious circus”.\n\n“I told him a few home truths. I told him that he and his other like-minded cretins were only sitting here because of our struggle and me – because of the things I and people like me had done to get freedom,” she said.\n\n“I am not sorry. I will never be sorry,” she concluded. “I would do everything I did again if I had to. Everything.”"
