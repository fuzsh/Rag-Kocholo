        "text": "Born Nomzamo Winifred Zanyiwe Madikizela, and known simply as \"Winnie\", she was married to Nelson Mandela for 38 years - one of the most storied romances of modern history.\n\nMost of their marriage was spent apart, with Nelson imprisoned for 27 years, leaving her to raise their two daughters alone and to keep alive his political dream under the repressive white-minority regime.\n\nIn 1990 the world watched when Nelson Mandela finally walked out of prison - hand in hand with Winnie.\n\nBut they separated just two years later and divorced in 1996 after a legal wrangle that revealed her affair with a young bodyguard.\n\nWith or without Nelson, Winnie built her own role as a tough, glamorous and outspoken black activist with a loyal grassroots following in the segregated townships.\n\n\"From every situation I have found myself in, you can read the political heat in the country,\" she said in a biography.\n\nIn this Feb. 13, 1990 file photo, Winnie Mandela, left, with her former husband Nelson Mandela, right, at a rally in Soweto, South Africa after his release Source: AAP\n\nWinnie was born September 26, 1936, in the village of Mbongweni in what is now Eastern Cape.\n\nShe completed university, a rarity for black women at the time, and became the first qualified social worker at Johannesburg's Baragwanath Hospital.\n\nIt was her political awakening, especially her research work in Alexandra township on infant mortality, which found 10 deaths in every 1,000 births.\n\n\"I started to realise the abject poverty under which most people were forced to live, the appalling conditions created by the inequalities of the system,\" she said.\n\nHounded by police\n\nNelson Mandela, who was then married to his first wife, met Winnie at a bus stop in Soweto when she was 22.\n\nThey wed in June 1958, but he soon went underground, pursued by the apartheid authorities.\n\nIn October that year, Winnie was arrested for the first time at a protest by women against the pass system that restricted movements of black people in white-designated areas.\n\nAfter Nelson was sentenced to life in prison in 1964, Winnie was also in and out of jail as the police hounded her in a bid to demoralise him.\n\nGovernment security forces tortured her, tried locking her up, confined her to Johannesburg's Soweto township, and then banished her to the desolate town of Brandfort, where her house was bombed twice.\n\nShe was rarely allowed to visit her husband in prison, and they were always divided by a glass screen.\n\nNelson Mandela and wife Winnie, walk hand in hand, raising their clenched fists upon his release from prison. Source: AAP\n\nLinked to 'necklacing'\n\nThroughout the height of apartheid, Winnie remained at the forefront of the struggle, urging students in the Soweto uprising in 1976 to \"fight to the bitter end\".\n\nBut in the 1980s, the militant-martyr began to be seen as a liability for Mandela and the liberation movement.\n\nShe had surrounded herself with a band of vigilante bodyguards called the Mandela United Football Club, who earned a terrifying reputation for violence.\n\nWinnie was widely linked to \"necklacing\", when suspected traitors were burnt alive by a petrol-soaked car tyre being put over their head and set alight.\n\nHer notoriety was reinforced by a speech in 1986 when she declared that \"with our boxes of matches and our necklaces we shall liberate this country.\"\n\n'Something went horribly wrong'\n\nIn 1991, Winnie was convicted of kidnapping and assault over the killing of Stompie Moeketsi, a 14-year-old boy.\n\nMoeketsi, who was accused being an informer, was murdered by her bodyguards in 1989.\n\nHer jail sentence was reduced to a fine, and she denied involvement in any murders when she appeared before Archbishop Desmond Tutu at the Truth and Reconciliation Commission hearings.\n\n\"She was a tremendous stalwart of our struggle, and icon of liberation - something went wrong, horribly, badly wrong,\" Tutu said as damning testimony implicated her.\n\nShe served as a deputy minister in President Mandela's government, but was sacked for insubordination and eased out of the top ranks of the ruling party.\n\nAfter a 2003 conviction for fraud, she later rehabilitated her political career winning a seat in parliament in 2009 elections.\n\nBut her bitterness emerged in 2010 newspaper interview, saying: \"Mandela let us down. He agreed to a bad deal for the blacks.\"\n\nShe also called Tutu a \"cretin\" and the reconciliation process a \"charade\", though she later claimed the quotes were never meant to be published\n\nDespite it all, she was a regular visitor travelling from Soweto - where she still lived - to Mandela's bedside in his final months, and she said she was present when he died.\n\nHe did not leave her anything in his will.\n\nAt her lavish 80th birthday party in Cape Town, Madikizela-Mandela wore a sparkling white dress and beamed with pleasure as she was lauded by guests that included senior politicians from rival parties.\n\n\"Mama Winnie has lived a rich and eventful life, whose victories and setbacks have traced the progress of the struggle of our people for freedom,\" then vice president Cyril Ramaphosa, who is now president, told guests."
