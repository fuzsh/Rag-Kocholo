        "text": "William Hooper\n\nPhenomenal Film Handler\n\nPosts: 1879\n\nFrom: Mobile, AL USA\n\nRegistered: Jun 99\n\nposted 08-30-2004 02:25 AM\n\nquote: Steve Kraus What was the deal with concerts? When they say a radio station presents some act it means something different than when they say a station welcomes the act to whatever venue.\n\nThere are usually 3 types of this:\n\n1. You just hear a concert spot on a music station that is targeted at the concert-going demo, & the spot is followed by a short piece of produced audio like \"Presented by 99.7 THE TERMITE\", or \"From your concert authority, 99.,7 THE TERMITE, etc. All they've done is exploited the linear construction of information presentation on the radio & added something to identify the station with the concert. It can be argued that the tag just refers to the *information* being presented by the station. The station does not have any real financial or organizational involvement with the show. The promoter usually doesn't care, as the station is punching the spot to cause more retention by the audience & it works for publicizing the show. An exception is if another radio station *is* involved in an arrangement with the promoter, even if that station is not mentioned on the spots run on competing stations. It is worth pointing out that Bill Young also has sent in no member picture.\n\nSimilar to this is if just using the information on the air as part of talking about local events & using the excitment generated by a concert to strengthen the station's image. Sometimes they'll say 99.7 THE TERMITE YOUR CONCERT CAPACITOR PRESENTS whatever the concert is; they can't say this though if another radio station *is* involved with the concert via a deal with the promoter.\n\n2. The promoter will cut a deal sometimes with a radio station in a market for a reduced price ad schedule for running the spots for the concert, in exchange for putting the station's name in the spots. This will sometimes include putting the station's name in the print ads, if the radio station gives a very sweetheart rate & rotation for the radio spots. Obviously, the selection of which radio station gets the name put on is made by the promoter by which radio station has a format most like the concert artists', & if there are a couple of stations running that format, he'll attempt to get competition between the stations for the best deal. The station that gets the deal gets custom spots with 99.7 THE TERMITE PRESENTS acutally voiced in the spot, other stations (if there are any more in the market the promoter will run the spot on, obviously he won't do a buy for 50 Cent on a Lite Rock or country station) will get a generic version of the same spot because they'll refuse the spot because it advertises the competition on their station. Sometimes a station will also negotiate reduced ad schedules to also hang banners, etc. at the venue during the show.\n\n3. Very rarely, a station will in some way act as or be involved with a promoter when putting on a concert. Most rare is any station putting a dime into a show; being a promoter is a white-knuckle, iron-cojones occupation that can go VERY bad when things go bad. In these cases, usually a promoter will have an idea for a package show, get with a local station which targets the demo that the promoter is targeting, the station & promoter hammer out various details of the show like 99.7 THE TERMITE PRESENTS TERMITE-FEST '05. Sometimes the station will have the idea, then get hold of a promoter to put it together. Like before, spots for the station & print ads are custom identifying the station with the show; if the audience of some competing radio stations have a target demo which includes the folks who might come to the show & throw dollars at them, the spots for any buys at those stations omit mentioning the station promoting the show.\n\nWhether they say \"presents\" or \"welcomes\" doesn't really matter; a station can pretty much use either even if unassociated with the show. Ya can't tell just from that. However, if another station has negotiated for a lower ad rate the local spiff of including the station's name in the concert spots on their station &/or print ads, they can't use \"presents\".\n\n| IP: Logged"
