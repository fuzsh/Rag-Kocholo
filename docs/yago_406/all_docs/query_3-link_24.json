        "text": "Brad Pitt is looking to reunite with Quentin Tarantino for The Movie Critic, his 10th and apparently final film, sources tell The Hollywood Reporter.\n\nThe duo previously collaborated on Inglourious Basterds (2009) and Once Upon a Time in Hollywood (2019), which landed Pitt a best supporting actor Oscar for the role of stuntman Cliff Booth.\n\nIt is unclear if Pitt has a deal for the Tarantino movie, but the actor will be tied up working on a Formula One racing feature for Apple and director Joseph Kosinski for much of the rest of the year. Filming on The Movie Critic would then commence, either late this year or in early 2025.\n\nTarantino has said he will retire from feature filmmaking after 10 films, which would make The Movie Critic his final film. The project is said to be set in 1970s Southern California, and is inspired by a cynical movie critic Tarantino read growing up.\n\nNo studio is yet attached to the project, which will film in California. Tarantino made Once Upon a Time in Hollywood for Sony, and he landed Oscar nominations for directing and writing. Tarantino is known for attracting top actors to populate his films, and interest among talent is expected to be high, given it could be the last chance to appear in one of the filmmaker’s features.\n\nPitt last starred in Damien Chazelle’s Babylon and David Leitch’s Bullet Train, both released in 2022. Upcoming, he has the Jon Watts-directed feature Wolfs, which reunites Pitt with his Ocean’s 11 collaborator George Clooney.\n\nPitt is repped by CAA, Brillstein Entertainment Partners and Goodman Genow."
