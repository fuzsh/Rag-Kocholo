        "text": "In addition to his work as an Oscar-winning director and screenwriter, Quentin Tarantino also has an affinity for acting. He’s been featured in a number of different films and television series. But one of his most memorable cameos is from the Adam Sandler comedy Little Nicky.\n\nTarantino appears as Deacon, a blind street preacher. He gets to try his hand at physical comedy here, as his character is especially accident-prone. Deacon repeatedly injures himself while attempting to call out Nicky’s inner darkness.\n\nIf you’re curious to see QT play opposite Adam Sandler, you can find the film streaming on Tubi as of the publication of this post. You can also scope a montage of Tarantino’s scenes in the player below.\n\nIn addition to Sandler and Tarantino, the film also stars Patricia Arquette, Harvey Keitel, Rhys Ifans, Tom Lister Jr., and Rodney Dangerfield. Sandler wrote the film with Tim Herlihy and Steven Brill. Brill also directed.\n\nThe setup goes like this:\n\nIn a perfect world, he’d be happy to head-bang in his room all day to heavy metal music. But no, his mom is an angel, his old man is the devil, and like all good fathers, he insists that Nicky get involved in the “family business.” Nicky could think of 666 things he’d rather be doing than corrupting souls or spewing evil. But when his father’s command over Hades is threatened by his bullying older brothers, it’s up to unbalanced Nicky to restore the balance between Good and Evil on earth.\n\nThat’s all we have for you, dear reader. Stay tuned to the site for more updates on which of your favorite films are streaming and where to find them. Also, be sure to follow @DreadCentral on Twitter so you never miss an update."
