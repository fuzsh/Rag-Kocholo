        "text": "Brad Pitt and Quentin Tarantino last worked together on Tarantino’s masterful Once Upon a Time In Hollywood, and now the duo might be re-teaming for QT’s next film, The Movie Critic.\n\nDeadline reports that it’s all but a done deal that Pitt and Tarantino are re-teaming for the third time, with Pitt possibly taking on the title role. The director and star clearly have chemistry, with Pitt winning Best Supporting Actor for his work as the lowkey stuntman Cliff Booth in Hollywood, and he led Tarantino’s World War II ensemble epic Inglourious Basterds. The studio most likely to take on Tarantino’s new film will be his Hollywood home, Sony Pictures, Deadline adds.\n\nWhile Tarantino has been mainly mum on the specifics of The Movie Critic, he did reveal in Cannes that it was set in California in 1977, the same year director John Flynn’s Rolling Thunder was released (Tarantino led a screening of the film at Cannes), and is based on “a guy who really lived but was never really famous, and he used to write movie reviews for a porno rag,” as he explained to Deadline‘s Baz Bamigboye.\n\nThe film is said to be inspired by Tarantino’s teenage job of loading porn magazines into a vending machine and cashing out the quarters. There was one magazine that caught the young Tarantino’s attention because of a lively movie review page where a critic (not even the rag’s top critic, mind you) wrote smart, snarky reviews that he really liked.\n\nTarantino has been working on the script, so what audiences eventually see in The Movie Critic could be pretty far removed from this bare-bones synopsis. Pitt’s turn as Cliff Booth was so winning, and the character so compelling (including a murky background and a facility for dispatching would-be killers with laidback elan) that there’s even chatter The Movie Critic could be Cliff Booth himself. Time will tell, but as always, any Tarantino movie is big news.\n\nFor more stories on all things Tarantino, check these out:\n\nQuentin Tarantino Working on his 10th & Possibly Last Film\n\nQuentin Tarantino Eyeing TV Project, Reveals Which Comic Book He’d Adapt\n\nDeconstructing Tarantino’s Once Upon a Time in Hollywood’s With his Cinematographer Robert Richardson\n\nCreating the Look for Tarantino’s Once Upon a Time in…Hollywood"
