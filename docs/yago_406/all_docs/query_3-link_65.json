He played Mr. Brown in DOGS, Jimmie in PULP, The Man from Hollywood in “The Man from Hollywood” segment of FOUR ROOMS. I’ve also read that he will take on Pei Mei in the killer revenge thriller KILL BILL. Now, those are most of his movies.\n\nDoes anybody know why Quentin didn’t write himself a role in “Jackie Brown”? Was it not what Elmore Leonard would’ve wanted in an adaption of Rum Punch? Did he love Pam Grier so much that he wanted to keep all eyes on her? I wonder…\n\n[quote]Everytime that I watch “Jackie Brown,” it gets better and better.

The voice on the phone message machine in Jackie Browns apartment is QT.\n\nQT isnt playing Pai Mei in Kill Bill, the role was given to a true Shaw Bros kung fu film veteran named Gordon Liu.\n\nI know QT was deeply into the Ordell Robbie character while he was writing the screenplay. He said that character was the hardest to let go of when he had to cast Sam The Man in the part because he basically WAS Ordell for 52 weeks while he was writing it.\n\nQT didnt need to be in the film, I’m glad he wasnt in it. I love the movie just the way it is.\n\n[quote]Well I wouldn’t go so far on that one buddy, I think he didn’t act in this one 'cause he was totally focus on Directing the movie as a Director alone, not as a Writer-Director like the other ones.[/quote]\n\nHes written and directed all his films. I think QT is a decent actor, but its a little much to be acting in and directing your movies.\n\nYeah, seriously, I think he could’ve been the character for Mark. He fits into it perfectly. He could’ve as least done a quick cameo? I mean like a backround shot of him in the mall or something. Like Alfred Hitchkock does in his cameos.\n\nNow in Kill Bill, he doesn’t do a cameo either. Just a voice cameo. Whatever. He were in the first two movies, he might as well have been in the rest."
