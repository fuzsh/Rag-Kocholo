        "text": "Legendary Hollywood director Quentin Tarantino is known for using the same actors throughout multiple films of his back catalogue.\n\nBritish actor Tim Roth (Reservoir Dogs, Pulp Fiction, The Hateful Eight) and Uma Thurman (Pulp Fiction, Kill Bill Volume 1 & 2) are two actors that have appeared in several Tarantino films.\n\nBut no one has appeared in more Tarantino films that the great Samuel L. Jackson.\n\nJackson has played memorable parts in Pulp Fiction (Jules Winnfield), Django Unchained (Stephen) and The Hateful Eight (Major Marquis Warren).\n\nIncredibly, out of Tarantino's eight full theatrical releases in which he has both written and directed, Jackson has starred in SIX of them.\n\nAlong with parts in Pulp Fiction, Django Unchained and The Hateful Eight, Jackson has also starred in Jackie Brown (Ordell Robbie), Kill Bill (Rufus) and Inglorious Basterds (Narrator).\n\nHe also appeared in the Tarantino written but not directed film True Romance.\n\nIncredible.\n\nAnd the love affair between the two Hollywood heavyweights is set to continue, with Tarantino reportedly writing a character for Jackson to play in his upcoming and yet-to-be-titled ninth film."
