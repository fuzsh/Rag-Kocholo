Is anyone forgetting his early part in the B-movie spoof\n\nReturn of the Killer Tomatoes?\n\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0095989/\n\nIt was released in 1988, way before FDTD. Now, I can see why he’d might like his involvement in this particular film striken from the records, but it made me wonder. It’s possible that Tomatoes doesn’t qualify as a feature film - to be honest, I’m not even sure that it had a cinematic release - but Clooney has definately had a taste of movie-acting before FDTD.\n\nAny thoughts?\n\nGeez! I had forgotten all about the Killer Tomatoes movies. LOL. If I remember correctly, that was a pretty small role for him. Maybe it wasn’t considered “his” first film cos he wasn’t a lead. I dunno. I’m pretty drunk and tired.\n\nYeah, he doesn’t get much screen time, so maybe that’s why it’s not his ‘first’ feature film. Or maybe he just doesn’t want the glory that was Attack of the Killer Tomatoes on his C.V. :laugh:"
