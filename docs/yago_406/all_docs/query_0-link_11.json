Put in your bit!\"\n\nRitchie to Scott and Kate: \"I grate my teeth\"\n\nSeth to Pete: \"Were you givin that pig signals?\"\n\nRitchie :whispering:\n\nSeth to Pete : \"He says you were scratchin\"\n\nJacob: \"I’m a mmmm mmmmm servant of God\"\n\nSeth: \"Has anybody here read any real books on vampires?\"\n\nSex Machine: \"You mean like Time-Life books?\"\n\nI laughed so hard when I was watching the TV version they put in stuff like:\n\n\"Say ‘Yes Seth I FINALLY Understand!!’ instead of fuckin understand.\n\nand ‘You just called me a FUNNY nut’ instead of fuckin nut.\n\nSeb, if FDTD is a Tarantino film, so is True Romance, thats PURE QT except for the directing just like FDTD.\n\nthe difference is, in FDTD, he wrote, acted and produced, as well as he was always around and more or less co-directed the movie (you see that when you watch the documentaries). in TR, qt had no influence on. he just wrote the script and maybe had some talks with Scott.\n\n[quote]the difference is, in FDTD, he wrote, acted and produced, as well as he was always around and more or less co-directed the movie (you see that when you watch the documentaries). in TR, qt had no influence on. he just wrote the script and maybe had some talks with Scott.[/quote]\n\nEver since I first saw TR back in 1993, Ive considered it a QT film. I know what you mean about FDTD, QT definitely had more to do with it. I just always considered TR a QT film, just not directed by him. All you gotta do is watch the movie.\n\nSeth: Those acts of God really stick it in and break it off, don’t they?\n\n---------------------\n\nClerk: Look. You asked me to act natural and I acted natural. And under the circumstances I think I oughta get a fucking Academy Award for acting natural. I did what you asked to get rid of him and I am doing my best.\n\nSeth: Well you best better get a helluva lot fucking better or you are going to feel a helluva lot fucking worse.\n\n---------------------\n\n(something like this)\n\nWhat the hell dyou think I want ya mean old bastard? I want a fuckin’ room!\n\n---------------------\n\nI can’t believe that no one has mentioned the whole ‘mongoloid’ speech at the beginning. I’ve seen the movie at least ten times and this scene has me laughing my balls off every time I watch it. I’d even go so far as to say that it matches the ‘Sicilian’ scene in True Romance.\n\n‘That fuckin idiot don’t know ratshit from Rice Krispies. I ate my breakfast at nine o’ clock and I’m pukin’ up pigs in a blanket like a sick fuckin dog come ten thirty’\n\n[quote]I can’t believe that no one has mentioned the whole ‘mongoloid’ speech at the beginning.

The Sicilian speech is classic. The mongoloid speech is funny shit, but its just a few lines of dialogue. Its not as important to that scene as the Sicilian speech is to the other scene.\n\nFDTD is a fun movie, it has some cool moments, but its not as good as any of QTs films thats for sure."
