        "text": "Quentin Tarantino's cameo in Pulp Fiction has been widely panned. I have rewatched his scenes and I agree that it is a jarring performance – when Tarantino is on the screen it feels like the fourth wall has been cracked; when the camera returns to the \"real\" actors it feels like we are back in the movie and not just watching actors. But I can't explain: why?\n\nWas there possibly a deliberate directorial decision behind the feel of these scenes being different? Is the audience meant to feel jarred by the change of location and/or viewpoint, perhaps? Could the fact that Jimmie is a seeming outsider to the life of the main characters possibly have something to do with it?\n\nHas Tarantino or anybody else associated with the movie given any indication that the change of style/pace/feel of the scenes set at Jimmie's house is due to anything other than Tarantino's acting skill (or lack thereof)?\n\n'Opinions are like assholes: everybody has one': Inspector \"Dirty\" Harry Callahan, 'The Dead Pool'.\n\nHere's mine: Quentin Tarantino is not a bad actor; he plays limited character types. He's certainly fantastic at learning lots of lines, delivering them rapid fire and playing awkward types.\n\nGiven that he writes the scripts, all the words are in his authorial voice, so when he delivers the lines too, we're getting double that voice. Perhaps that's what makes it uncomfortable for some people to hear. I think because he writes them, he's so familiar with them and it enables him to rattle off lines quickly, lending his characters a nervous, shifty energy.\n\nanswered Jul 20, 2021 at 5:35\n\nReaghanReaghan\n\n2722 bronze badges"
