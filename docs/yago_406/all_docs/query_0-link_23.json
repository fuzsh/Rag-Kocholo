        "text": "Considering that From Dusk Till Dawn is supposed to mimic a cheap, sleazy horror movie -- a genre Rodriguez and Tarantino revisited in Grindhouse -- it is possible that the makers decided to employ a tactic often used in such movies: the reuse of the same actor in multiple bit parts.\n\nNote that the role of Carlos was originally intended for Erik Estrada.\n\nIn his book Quentin Tarantino FAQ: Everything Left to Know About the Original Reservoir Dog, Dale Sherman theorizes:\n\nErik Estrada was to have appeared at the end of the movie as Carlos, the gangster that the Geckos went to the Tiny Twister to meet. Instead, when Estrada dropped out, it was decided that Cheech Marin, who had already played two other parts in the film, would be perfect in the role. It does round out his appearances in the film, making his characters like a distortion of the farm/Oz characters being played by the same actors in the beginning, middle and end of The Wizard of Oz."
