He has brought out some of the career-best performances from actors, with many of them winning coveted awards for their roles.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nQuentin Tarantino has collaborated with the likes of Leonardo DiCaprio, Brad Pitt, Bruce Willis, Uma Thurman, and more. He has had long collaborations with actors like Samuel L Jackson. While the legendary filmmaker is gearing up for his tenth and final film The Movie Critic, he reveals the one thing directors should not do while directing actors.\n\nAlso read: “No comments”: Samuel L Jackson Teases Collaboration with Quentin Tarantino on Final Film, Claims Being Surprised to See Director Attend his Oscar Ceremony\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe Many Collaborations Of Quentin Tarantino\n\nQuentin Tarantino started his career as a director with the heist film Reservoir Dogs. The film starred prominent stars such as Harvey Keitel, Chris Penn, and Michael Madson, as well as future stars such as Tim Roth and Steve Buscemi. The crime film was the director’s breakthrough and has since been considered a gold standard in independent filmmaking.\n\nThe director’s next film Pulp Fiction put him on the map. It is regarded as a cult classic and won the Palm d’Or at the 1994 Cannes Film Festival. It also won Quentin Tarantino an Oscar for Best Original Screenplay.\n\nAlso read: “I can’t think of any other star”: Bruce Willis Might Make Last Hollywood Appearance in Quentin Tarantino’s Final Movie Under One Condition as Actor Struggles With Incurable Dementia\n\nAdvertisement\n\nPulp Fiction was also the beginning of a long collaboration of the director with actor Samuel L Jackson, with whom he has since collaborated on six films. The film also was a well-deserving return to form for legendary actor John Travolta. Travolta’s performance as Vincent Vega, a contract killer, was unanimously lauded upon release. The film gave a change of pace to action star Bruce Willis, who was seen in a different kind of role The film also starred Uma Thurman with whom the director worked on the Kill Bill series.\n\nThe director again brought back a legendary star of the yesteryears with Death Proof where he collaborated with Kurt Russell. The film was part of the double feature Grindhouse which also consisted of Robert Rodiguez’s Planet Terror.\n\nQuentin Tarantino collaborated with stars Brad Pitt in Inglorious Basterds and Leonardo DiCaprio in Django Unchained.

OK?”: Quentin Tarantino Ruthlessly Screamed At Jamie Foxx, Warned Him To Not Ruin His Film\n\nQuentin Tarantino On Working With Actors\n\nQuentin Tarantino has worked with the best of the best in Hollywood. From reviving the careers of stars like John Travolta and Michael Madson to bringing Oscar glory to well-known stars, he has done it all. He seems to have the ability to bring the drama out of the actors, allowing them to shine in every scene.\n\nOn being asked what he would advise young filmmakers on directing actors, Tarantino said to not be intimidated by them. The director has worked with stalwarts like Robert DeNiro, Al Pacino, and Leonardo DiCaprio said,\n\nAdvertisement\n\n“Don’t be scared. Don’t be intimidated by them. You’re there to find it together…don’t tell them how to do the scene, don’t tell them what you are looking for. They have the material themselves and they’ve come up with their own thing.”\n\nAlso read: “If you don’t respond, that’s fine”: Quentin Tarantino Risked Losing Bruce Willis in His $213M Movie After Die Hard Star Set His Demand Against Rookie Director\n\nThe director in multiple interviews has stressed giving actors their space to perform. Speaking about his process of giving his actors the first shot at performing a scene,\n\nAdvertisement\n\n“You will never see what was in their head. An adjustment is the easiest thing in the world to give. You’re the director and they’ll do whatever say, but let them do the first shot at it, what they came up with.”\n\nHe has also spoken about the importance of being near the actors while they are performing. The director can constantly be seen near the camera while the scene is happening, preferring that over a monitor. Talking about this practice,\n\n“One of the best things a director can do is to not be stuck in Video Village, not be stuck behind a monitor…I think we should be sitting right by the camera. If you watch the acting right in front of the actors, it is as if they are acting just and solely, and utterly only for you.”\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe director has seldom given a bad performance for his actors as many have gone on to win many awards for their performances in his films as well as gain universal acclaim.\n\nSource: Far Out\n\nAlso read: “I steal from every single movie ever made”: 2 Time Oscar Winner Quentin Tarantino Clapped Back After Accusations Of Being A Copycat"
