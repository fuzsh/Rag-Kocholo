        "text": "o Forbids all cell phones on the set when shooting, insisting that all such devices be turned in at point of entry – no exceptions.\n\no The Big Kahuna burger is mentioned in at least three of Tarantino’s films.\n\no His mother reluctantly consented to allow him to drop out of Narbonne High School at age 16 on the condition he get a job. “I wanted him to see that life without education would not be a picnic.” She thought he would return more focused and go onto college. Tarantino with a reported 160 IQ wanted to study acting and felt he could learn more following his own path.\n\no His films mainly feature criminals and characters committing horrible crimes involving murder and drugs. The only crime Tarantino has committed was shoplifting from a bookstore when he was a teenager.\n\no Detests CGI (Computer-generated imagery) trickery, opting not to shoot a sequence at all unless it can be accomplished ‘in-camera’. If a chase has to be filmed at 80 mph, it must be captured as it happens and not faked with camera under-cranking.\n\no He got his first job in the film industry at age 16, by lying about his age, as an usher at Pussycat Theater, a porn theater in Torrance, California.\n\no One of his biggest pet peeves while filming is actors and crew members napping on set. In his words “It always kinda bugged me so I came up with something where it wouldn’t bug me.” That something was a huge purple dildo named “Big Jerry”. When ever an actor or crew member dozes off on set Quentin puts “Big Jerry” as close to the offenders face as he can without waking them and snaps photos that are hung on “The Wall of Shame” on set. Several photos of A-list actors and “Big Jerry” exist. All in good humor and fun according to the director.\n\no In 2018, Oxford English Dictionary added term “Tarantinoesque” into its collection and described Tarantinoesque films as “characterized by graphic and stylized violence, non-linear storylines, cineliterate references, satirical themes, and sharp dialogue”.\n\no Insists on being beside the camera at all times during a take. The notion of being in another room watching his actors perform on a video-assist monitor is both anathema and unacceptable to him.\n\no His mother Connie McHugh was only age 16 when she gave birth to him.\n\nAlthough he uses both elements in his films, he strongly detests violence and drugs.\n\no Has stated that he would like to make and star in a film telling the story of John Brown, the abolitionist.\n\no One of his favorite horror films is the original Black Christmas (1974). His tradition is to watch the film in his home theater every Christmas season.\n\no He considers Ride in the Whirlwind (1966) one of the finest Westerns ever made, even writing an extensive article about it for Sight & Sound magazine titled A Rare Sorrow. The article was featured in the Pulp Fiction (1994) Special Edition DVD as an extra and also appears in Paul A. Woods’ Film Geek Files (pgs. 129-132). Interestingly, the director of Ride in the Whirlwind, Monte Hellman, was the executive producer of Reservoir Dogs (1992).\n\no Among his favorite authors is a Russian poet Boris Pasternak, whose grave Tarantino had visited in June 2004, while visiting Moscow Film Festival.\n\no He worked at Video Archives in Manhattan Beach, California from 1985-1990 with future filmmakers Roger Avary and Daniel Synder. He became well known to local residents for his extensive knowledge of world cinema and eclectic, customer tailored video recommendations. He wrote several screenplays during his time at Video Archives including Reservoir Dogs (1992) True Romance (1993) and Natural Born Killers (1994). He purchased the entire stores video inventory of 8000 titles when it closed that he prefers watching to using video streaming services, like Netflix.\n\no Became a father for the first time at the age of 56 when his wife Daniella Pick gave birth to son Leo on February 22nd, 2020. Leo is named after his wife’s grandfather and not Tarantino’s frequent star Leonardo DiCaprio.\n\n* * *"
