        "text": "Goofy and loyal to his old man, Joe, Eddie (the late Chris Penn) is one of the more underrated characters in Quentin Tarantino's feature-length debut as a director. Sporting that blue tracksuit jacket with the dark slacks and dark shoes, \"Nice Guy Eddie\" is comical while casually intense. His part in the film's famed \"Mexican-standoff\" scene is short but sweet.\n\nIt's tough for any veteran actor to steal a scene from Brad Pitt or Leonardo DiCaprio, let alone a 10-year-old. That's just what Julia Butters' Fraser did. While the film has generally received solid reviews, critics raved about Butters, and rightfully so. Fraser shines during a grown-up conversation with has-been actor Rick Dalton, played by DiCaprio, who told Vanity Fair Butters reminds him of a young Meryl Streep. Talk about praise.\n\nA Union soldier from the Civil War turned bounty hunter, at least Warren (Samuel L. Jackson) can find work. An extrovert, Warren apparently was tight with Abe Lincoln and pretty cold-hearted and vengeful. The Major tends to be a little more authentic than other front-line characters when Tarantino goes the Western-theme route and is pretty solid as a leading man.\n\nPerhaps it's Harvey Keitel's most memorable role in the Tarantino directorial universe. Mr. White is a man of common sense, relatively intelligent, and organized. He's a true professional in the heist game, but we also learn he's trusting, loyal, and even compassionate â to a fault. That's why White is actually one of the most genuine â good or bad â of all the Tarantino characters.\n\nRick is likable as this down-on-his-luck actor who is past his prime but thinks Hollywood â and everyone else â still owes him whatever he wants. Of course, Leonardo DiCaprio delivers an expected strong performance to help add credibility to the overall character.\n\nLike Dalton, Cliff (Brad Pitt) is worthy of this acknowledgment, and we can see Booth moving higher on this list as time passes. Cliff is Pitt at his best: someone who plays himself off as a cool customer and seems to dig his life no matter what comes along, good or bad.\n\nOne of the best rants in any Tarantino film comes courtesy of the self-insightful, always opinionated Mr. Pink (Steve Buscemi) regarding his disdain for tipping. Pink tends to be the comic relief in his dark, neo-noir heist film, mostly through his wisecracks. He's not necessarily a main character but leaves a memorable mark.\n\nDjango (Jamie Foxx) often gets lost in the mix of other great leading roles from the famed director's films. He has a purpose, all the while trying to get back in touch with his wife. Django is a smart hero who seemingly unintentionally offers some comedic moments that play to his character's human side.\n\nBecause of his large stature, Wallace (Ving Rhames) is as intimidating as gangster leaders come. He's also vulnerable but knows that one good deed deserves another, especially when your life might be on the line â or your dignity at the very least. Marsellus also delivers some of the best dialogue in any Tarantino film, even at his lowest possible point.\n\nBell has become a staple in Tarantino's films and should be best known for playing herself in this 2007 effort. That's where she shows off her stuntwoman talents while riding on the hood of a Dodge Challenger. Though the film ranks near the bottom of Tarantino's directorial filmography in terms of popularity and acclaim, Bell's performance is pretty unforgettable.\n\n\"The Wolf,\" as he's also referred to, has a brief but memorable role in this Tarantino smash. He might be the coolest, calmest, most perfect fixer in the business. It doesn't matter how messy the problem is, \"The Wolf\" can clean it up. Even bits of brain splattered in a car. He's informed, organized, and ready to get the job done in record time. He also likes his coffee with lots of cream and sugar.\n\nThere are Tarantino villains who we like and root for. Then there is Calvin Candie (Leonardo DiCaprio). The racist plantation owner who takes pleasure in watching his slaves wrestle is certainly somebody we can't wait to see meet his demise. Of course, DiCaprio makes Candie entertaining in an evilly delicious way that perhaps only this superstar can.\n\nA role that brought relevance back to veteran actor Robert Forster's career, Max exudes the kind of cool that Tarantino tries to reach with at least one of the main characters in his movies. Jackie's bondsman is also someone she can count on and trust. Max can be effective and intriguing without saying a word at times throughout the movie.\n\nThere's that specific sadistic approach to whatever topic accompanies some of Tarantino's leading characters. It's usually from the male leads. Meet Daisy Domergue (Jennifer Jason Leigh), a fugitive who is smart and strong, quirky and cunning but not afraid to shed some blood â whether her own or somebody else's. She's troubled but content in her purpose.\n\nDavid Carradine is a special actor, and this role of his should forever be celebrated. There is a mystery surrounding Bill, and we certainly know how \"The Bride\" feels about him. He's got a complex history full of twists and turns and seems tied to about anybody who matters in both films. We know there's a sense of loyalty and compassion inside, but he struggles with emotion. His demise is also one of the more dramatic we've seen in any Tarantino-directed picture.\n\nO-Ren Ishii (Lucy Liu) should not be labeled as \"the other woman\" in the Kill Bill films. In many ways, O-Ren's story is as intriguing as that of the main female protagonist. She's independent but haunted by a past she's trying to avenge. Plus, she delivers one of the best lines in any Tarantino flick. We're not sure what to think of O-Ren, but we know she can hold her own with anybody.\n\nMr. Blonde (Michael Madsen) had some good lines and seemed most confident in Joe Cabot's crew. However, one of the most memorable and potentially stomach-churning yet iconic torture scenes in all film history puts Mr. Blonde in the top 10. Anybody who has seen Reservoir Dogs will never listen to Stealers Wheel's \"Stuck in the Middle with You\" any other way.\n\nThe role revived Pam Grier's career. Jackie Brown is a no-nonsense woman looking for a little excitement in her life. So why not become a drug courier? Even though the movie is an adaptation of Elmore Leonard's novel Rum Punch, the character of Jackie on screen is real, liberating, and often described as among the most mature of any of Taratino's lead roles.\n\nButch (Bruce Willis) will go to any lengths for his family â or at least the memory of his father and that precious watch. He's also good in a pinch when one's life is on the line. In less than 24 hours, he killed a man in the boxing ring with an automatic weapon and a sword â and settled his debt to Marsellus Wallace â while getting his life and freedom back.\n\nHe's ruthless and unforgiving and only wants one thing: to kill Nazis without any sort of prejudice. Raine (Brad Pitt) is a unique character. He's a pretty smart hillbilly and a born leader. He's loyal to his men and the cause and almost uncomfortably obsessed with taking down the Germans. He's another one of Tarantino's complex yet enjoyable characters.\n\nLike Calvin Candie, Landa is one of the most despised bad guys Tarantino has ever created. Landa is the devil in an SS uniform. He's full of himself and does not care who he steps on to get what he wants to succeed. It's all made possible and brought to life by the uber-talented Christoph Waltz, who won an Academy Award for the role.\n\nTruth be told, Mia Wallace (Uma Thurman) is not a likable character, but she's certainly entertaining. She's an above-average dancer but does not know how to hold her drugs. She's almost cartoon-like but in a demented, R-rated way. Yet her storyline within Pulp Fiction is probably the most memorable because of her presence.\n\nIn a lot of ways, the audience can feel for Jules (Samuel L. Jackson) despite his line of work as a hit man. He's prophetic in a Hollywood way and gives his victims fair warning before popping them. Jules might also be the most intelligent of Tarantino's bad guys. He's well-read, and we know he's God-fearing. With his life and mortality at a crossroads, he might be one of Tarantino's most complex characters.\n\n\"The Bride\" (Uma Thurman) is not just the coolest female character from any Tarantino film but would not be a wrong No. 1 choice here. Is she the greatest female heroine in movie history of the non-superhero variety? She should be in the running. Beatrix is as tough as they come in the true sense of the word, yet manages to pull off her job requirement with confidence and â if possible â grace. Definitely someone we want on our side.\n\nAs we've seen, there are many worthy choices to top this list, but Vega just exudes all that Tarantino seems to be about. He's someone we can't quite put the finger on but are drawn to in a strange way. We want to know more about him, and he tends to surprise us with his laid-back, sometimes self-assuring dialogue or dancing. He's a perfect complement to the over-the-top Jules. It was the role that made John Travolta relevant â again â and should be the first character who comes to mind when thinking about Tarantino films."
