        "text": "Quentin Tarantino was born March 27, 1963 in Knoxville, Tennessee.\n\nThe darling of 1990s indie cinema, Tarantino rose seemingly overnight from being a video store clerk in Manhattan Beach, California to a lauded filmmaker after toying with a career as an actor (he did play an Elvis impersonator on an episode of The Golden Girls). After selling his screenplays for True Romance and Natural Born Killers, both of which were ultimately made by other filmmakers, Tarantino made his feature film directing debut with Reservoir Dogs."
