        "text": "Quentin Tarantino (born March 27, 1963) is an Oscar-winning filmmaker who is known for his use of violence, profanity, extended monologues, pop culture references and recurring cast members, like Samuel L. Jackson. He made his debut with the independent crime drama \"Reservoir Dogs\" in 1992, which put him on Hollywood's radar made his follow-up \"Pulp Fiction\" (1994) highly anticipated. The film, starring Jackson, John Travolta, Uma Thurman and Bruce Willis, earned the Palme d'Or at Cannes, the Oscar for original screenplay and a best director nomination for Tarantino. In 1997, he paid homage to blaxploitation films with \"Jackie Brown,\" then made \"Kill Bill\" (2003 and 2004), starring Thurman in a two-part, martial arts epic. His next films were the action thriller \"Death Proof\" (2007) and \"Inglourious Basterds\" (2009), a WWII film starring Brad Pitt and Oscar winner Christoph Waltz that received nominations for best director and original screenplay. Next came \"Django Unchained\" (2013), a revisionist Western starring Jamie Foxx as an escaped slave, Jackson, Waltz and Leonardo DiCaprio. It won original screenplay at the Oscars and a second supporting actor win for Waltz.\n\nTarantino made the Western mystery \"The Hateful Eight\" starring Jackson and Kurt Russell in 2015, and in 2019 came the hit comedy drama \"Once Upon a Time in Hollywood.\" The film starred DiCaprio, Pitt and Margot Robbie, and it earned Tarantino his first best picture nomination at the Oscars, Pitt his first acting Oscar, plus director and original screenplay nods. Tarantino's supposedly final film before retirement is allegedly titled \"The Movie Critic\" and will focus on a man who reviewed films for a pornographic magazine."
