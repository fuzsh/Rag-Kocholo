        "text": "In 1992, Quentin Tarantino released his debut feature, Reservoir Dogs, which married stylistic violence and comedy in a completely innovative way. People reacted strongly to the director’s first film, which even caused horror director Wes Craven to walk out of the cinema. Clearly, Tarantino’s movie had an effect on people, and it continues to do so decades later.\n\nFollowing Reservoir Dogs, Tarantino sold two screenplays – True Romance and Natural Born Killers, both of which helped cover the cost of his next film, Pulp Fiction. He collaborated with Robert Rodriguez for the first time for 1996’s From Dusk till Dawn, reteaming with him in the future for Grindhouse, a double feature including Tarantino’s Death Proof and Rodriguez’s Planet Terror.\n\nHowever, that’s not the first time Tarantino has collaborated multiple times with someone, often inviting actors he has previously worked with to star in his next films. After Reservoir Dogs, the filmmaker started this tradition, with several cast members from the movie appearing in Pulp Fiction, like Tim Roth and Harvey Keitel. It appears that when Tarantino works well with an actor, he wants them to stick around. While the director himself actually takes the top spot for the person to have starred in the most Tarantino films – the man loves a cameo – it’s Samuel L. Jackson who has collaborated with him most.\n\nThe actor has appeared in six of his movies, as well as the Tarantino-penned True Romance. His first role under the direction of Tarantino was in Pulp Fiction, playing the iconic Jules Winnfield, a character who particularly enjoys a “tasty burger.”\n\nA few years later, they reunited for Jackie Brown before he made a small appearance in Kill Bill Vol.2 as an organ player. Since then, Jackson has also appeared in Inglourious Basterds, Django Unchained and The Hateful Eight.\n\nA lesser-known actor, James Parks, is one of Tarantino’s most frequent collaborators, featuring in five movies. The son of Michael Parks, who has also featured in four Tarantino films (and From Dusk till Dawn), the younger actor often stars in small roles. He has appeared in Kill Bill Vol 1 and 2, Death Proof, Django Unchained and The Hateful Eight.\n\nAnother slightly surprising entry to the list is Zoë Bell, best known for her stunt work. Yet she has acted in four of Tarantino’s movies, including Death Proof, playing herself, and Django Unchained. She has also carried out stunts in two of his films, most notably performing for Uma Thurman in Kill Bill.\n\nDiscover the actors who have appeared in the most Tarantino movies below.\n\nQuentin Tarantino’s most frequent collaborators:"
