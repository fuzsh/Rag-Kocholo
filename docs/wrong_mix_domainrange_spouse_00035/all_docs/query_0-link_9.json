        "text": "The United States Presidents and The Illuminati / The Masonic Power Structure\n\nThe United States Presidents and The Illuminati / The Masonic Power StructureOrthodoxoOnline\n\nI have always seen list's of famous Masons. To just look at the name means very little. When you date and place those names in the proper time line and placement of power you begin to see the deception and vastness of this power elite. What will shock you even more is to learn who the powers are behind the Freemasons. Notice the death's of non Masonic presidents or those who lost favor, and the shuffling of the vice presidents to get them in the position of takeover before the presidents were killed or removed. Note also the number of presidential running mates who lost the race for presidency were Masons also. A win win situation regardless of the outcome of the election. The Mason's have controlled this country from the beginning. Another interesting fact to consider is that of the 37 Presidents of the United States before Jimmy Carter, at least 18 or 21 (depending on which source you believe) were close relatives. That comes to somewhere between 48.6 percent and 56.7 percent-far to much to be coincidence, as any conspiritologist (or mathematician) would tell you. Of the 224 ancestors in the family tree of 21 Presidents, we find 13 Roosevelt's, 16 Coolidge's, and 14 Tyler's. Another source manages to relate 60 percent of the Presidents and link most of them to the super-rich Astor family. This data does not include genealogies of the five most recent President. Psychologist G. William Domhoff claims that a large part of America's Ruling elite, just like that of Europe, are related by marriage. (Everything is Under Control. Conspiracies, Cults, and Cover-Ups by Robert Anton Wilson pg 39-40)\n\nThe Mormon Moons of Lancashire (presented at the AHRA 2023 Winter Seminar)\n\nThe Mormon Moons of Lancashire (presented at the AHRA 2023 Winter Seminar)Cometan\n\nOn 6th June 1840, the Britannia set sail from the docks at Liverpool. Aboard this ship was a group of forty-one newly converted Latter-day Saints from Lancashire. This voyage was the first of its kind and included more than two dozen members of the Moon family of Eccleston. They had converted to Mormonism in 1837 and decided to emigrate to America to reconcile with their new prophet Joseph Smith at the New Jerusalem in the American Midwest. The hardships the Moon family faced after their departure from Liverpool were immense and eventually saw them follow Brigham Young as pioneers, venturing beyond the furthest reaches of the United States to escape persecution. In 1850, the Moon family reached their final destination of the Great Salt Lake Valley in Utah but would continue to face threats of imprisonment due to their practice of polygamy. This lecture narrates the journey of the Moon family as the first Mormons to leave England for America and is a story of faith, tribulation and tragedy.\n\nObituary of John AdamsOctober 30, 1735-July 4, 1826 John .docx\n\nObituary of John AdamsOctober 30, 1735-July 4, 1826 John .docxvannagoforth\n\nObituary of John Adams October 30, 1735-July 4, 1826 John Adams, 91 years of age, died on Tuesday, July 4, 1826, from heart failure at his home in Quincy, Massachusetts, United States. John Adams was born on October 30, 1735, in Braintree (now Quincy), Massachusetts Bay, British America to the late John Adams Sr and Susanna Boylston. Adams was the first child of three children brother to the late Elihu Adams and Peter Adams. John Adam senior was a descendant of Henry Adam, English emigrants to the Massachusetts Bay Colony in 1638. His farmer was a farmer, town councilman, and the deacon of the congressional church. His mother, Susanna Boylston Adams, was a descendant of a prominent loyal family of Boylston of Brookline in colonial Massachusetts. At the age of 16, John Adams earned a scholarship to study law at Harvard University. As an enthusiast scholar, John keenly studied the work of prominent scholars such as Plato, Cicero, Thucydides, and Tacitus. Despite his father's desire for John to enter Ministry, John studied law in the office of James Putnam, a prominent city lawyer. John earned his master's degree in 1758 and became admitted to the bar at the age of 23. After completing his studies at Harvard University, John began the habit of writing about events and impressions of statemen like James Otis Jr (1761). John Adams married the late Abigail Smith on October 25, 1764. Together they had six children, namely Abigail (1765), John Quincy (1767), Susanna (1768), Charles (1770), Thomas Boylston (1772), and Elizabeth (1777). Political interest regularly separated Adams from his family. Drawing inspiration from Otis, Adams chanted his cause of the American colonies. In 1965, John Adams identified himself with patriot cause from official opposition of the 1965 Stamp Act. Adams expository “Canon and Feudal,” a response to the act by British Parliament, was published in Boston Gazette. John alluded that, “Stamp Act taxed people without consent and subjected them to be tried by a jury of peers.” Following heated debates after two months, John denounced Stamp Act publicly in a speech delivered to the council and governor of Massachusetts. Aware of the political quagmire, John refused to be drawn to mob actions and public demonstration by Samuel Adams. Adams moved to Boston in April 1768 to enhance his political career. In 1770, Adams presented British soldiers in a lawsuit for killing five civilians (Boston Massacre). Moved by the defense for people right, Adam argued that in a fair trial, every person deserves attorney representation. During the trial, Adams blamed the rowdy mob. The jury found two of the eight soldiers guilty and convicted them for manslaughter, while six were acquitted. His defense prowess enhanced his reputation as a generous, courageous, and fair man. In 1774, Adams was elected to the Massachusetts Assembly and was among the five representatives of the colony in Continental Congress ..."
