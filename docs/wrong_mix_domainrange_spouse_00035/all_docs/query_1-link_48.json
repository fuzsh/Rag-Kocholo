By contributing $1,000 or more in a fiscal year (July 1 – June 30), you are among our most loyal supporters and we are grateful for your partnership.\n\nSince 2006, Berkeley Public Health’s Dean’s Circle has been a community of committed individual benefactors who share in and support the Dean’s vision for the school’s future by making annual leadership gifts. Your collective generosity inspires others to follow your example."
