        "text": "Philippine professional basketball team\n\nThis article is about Purefoods basketball franchise. For the franchise previously known as the Magnolia Beverage Masters, see San Miguel Beermen.\n\nThe Magnolia Chicken Timplados Hotshots, or simply known as the Magnolia Hotshots, are a professional basketball team in the Philippine Basketball Association. The team is owned by San Miguel Food and Beverage, Inc., a subsidiary of San Miguel Corporation (SMC). The team is one of three PBA ball clubs currently owned by the SMC group of companies, along with Barangay Ginebra San Miguel and the San Miguel Beermen. They have 14 PBA championships, tied with the Alaska Aces for the third-most overall.\n\nThe franchise plays under numerous brand names of the company but is best known by its original name, Purefoods. It remains as one of the most popular teams in the PBA,[1] winning fourteen PBA titles and is the fourth team in PBA history to win a Grand Slam.\n\nThe players most identified with the franchise are Alvin Patrimonio, James Yap, and Marc Pingris, among others. Patrimonio, a Mapua University standout, led the franchise to six championships and was named Most Valuable Player four times. Patrimonio retired in 2004 and currently serves as its team manager. Yap led Purefoods to seven titles including a notable grand slam in 2013–14, which is the only grand slam in the history of the franchise and received multiple MVP awards as well. While Pingris was named to the PBA's 40 greatest players playing alongside Yap as the team's enforcer and rebounder. He was a vocal leader of the famous 2013 Gilas Pilipinas team that defeated South Korea and bagged a medal.\n\nPrior to joining the PBA in 1988, Purefoods was a member of the Philippine Amateur Basketball League (PABL, later renamed the Philippine Basketball League) and was one of the strongest teams during its tenure with the amateur league. In early 1988, Pure Foods Corporation (then, a subsidiary of Ayala Corporation) acquired the PBA franchise of the original Tanduay team, after Elizalde & Company, Inc. announced it was leaving the PBA.\n\nIn 2001, Pure Foods Corporation, including its PBA franchise, was sold by Ayala Corporation to San Miguel Corporation. The following year, Pure Foods Corporation was renamed San Miguel Pure Foods Company, Inc. The franchise continued to play under the Purefoods banner until 2010.\n\nBeginning 2010, the franchise played under other brand names of the company – B-Meg (from 2010 to 2012), San Mig Coffee (from 2012 to 2014) and Star (from 2014 to 2017). Beginning the 2017–18 PBA season, the team started playing under the Magnolia Chicken brand name.[2]\n\nAs part of the deal to join the league, Purefoods was allowed to take some amateur players from the PABL and the national team. Purefoods then drafted Alvin Patrimonio, Jojo Lastimosa, Jerry Codiñera, Glenn Capacio and the number one overall pick of the rookie draft that year; Jack Tanuan. They also added Al Solis and Totoy Marquez from Shell. However, there was a surrounding controversy on the case of Patrimonio, as his PABL team Swift denied Patrimonio's release. The issue was settled before the All-Filipino Conference though, and Patrimonio joined the team.\n\nPurefoods also took the core of the defunct Tanduay squad, namely, Ramon Fernandez, who was designated playing-coach, Freddie Hubalde, Padim Israel, Willie Generalao, Victor Sanchez, JB Yango and Onchie dela Cruz. David Thirdkill, who led Tanduay to the previous year's Open Conference championship and was named Best Import of the conference, was hired as Purefoods' reinforcement for the Open Conference this time.\n\nIn their first conference, Purefoods made a historic run to the finals against the Norman Black-led San Miguel Beermen in seven games. In the next conference, Cris Calilan replaced Fernandez as head coach after the first round of the eliminations. They met crowd favorite Añejo Rhum 65 in the finals. Purefoods lost the series 3–1 against a veteran and rugged team of playing coach Robert Jaworski. Controversy arose during the series as Fernandez was ordered to be benched by then-Purefoods Corporation president Rene Buhain amid rumors of game-fixing. This issue led to Fernandez's transfer to San Miguel for Abet Guidaben late in the season. Lastimosa was named as the 1988 Rookie of the Year at the end of the season.\n\nIn 1989, Purefoods lost in six games to San Miguel in the All-Filipino Conference. An incident also happened during the second round of the eliminations of that conference when Samboy Lim nearly suffered a career-ending injury when he drove over Lastimosa causing him to fall off-balance and hit head first on the parquet floor. This happened on July 18, 1989, with Purefoods winning 125–115. There was a huge public outcry after that game with many fans decrying Lastimosa's actions as dirty.\n\nIn the season-ending 1990 Reinforced Conference, Purefoods took on Alaska Air Force for the title. This conference featured two imports and Purefoods tapped the services of Daren Queenan and Rob Rose, who replaced Walker Russell during the elimination round. The Air Force took a 2–0 lead with a win away to clinch the best of five series. However, the team of legendary coach Baby Dalupan led a stunning comeback to win the series 3–2, giving the franchise its first PBA title. The championship was Dalupan's last but it made him the first coach in PBA history to win PBA championships in three different decades. The other coach who achieved this feat was Norman Black and Tim Cone.\n\nDuring the offseason, Purefoods traded Lastimosa to Alaska for Cabahug and Al Solis to Sarsi for Jun Tan. They also signed free agent swingman Elmer Reyes.\n\nIn 1991, Patrimonio was offered a 5-year, PhP 25 million deal by Pepsi Cola, which was matched by Purefoods. With the development, he became the highest paid player in the league. With this, Purefoods was able to beat Sarsi to win the 1991 All-Filipino Conference under head coach Ely Capacio. Patrimonio won the 1991 Most Valuable Player, the first of a record-tying four MVPs he had won.\n\nPurefoods failed to defend the crown in 1992, losing in seven games to San Miguel.\n\nIn 1993, the team was renamed as the Coney Island Ice Cream Stars, an ice cream brand owned by Pure Foods Corporation. They drafted four rookies that year – Dwight Lago, Benny Cheng, Freddie Abuda, and Olsen Racela; and acquired veteran forward Abe King from the disbanded Presto team. The Stars won the 1993 All-Filipino Cup defeating San Miguel, 4–2. Their head coach was Chot Reyes, who achieved a milestone for winning the title in his first conference as coach.\n\nConey Island was renamed Purefoods Oodles during the Commissioner's Cup. They were bannered by Patrimonio, Codiñera, and Dindo Pumaren, with Capacio, Cabahug, King, and Racela completed the supporting cast. For their reinforcement, they hired Ronnie Grandison who was able to take them straight to the finals. They had a chance to win back-to-back PBA titles but were defeated by corporate rival Swift in six games for the crown of the said tournament. Patrimonio won his second Most Valuable Player award after the season.\n\nIn the Governors' Cup, Purefoods Oodles reverted to Purefoods Tender Juicy Hotdogs. With import Tharon Mayes, they had a record of 7–3 in the eliminations, but were eliminated in the semifinals with a record of 9–9.\n\nFor the 1994 All-Filipino Conference, the team drafted three rookies – Rey Evangelista, Vince Hizon, and Peter Naron. The Stars also added another rookie in Richie Ticzon whom they acquired through a draft-day trade that sent veteran point guard Pumaren and Lago to Pepsi Mega. To add experience to the roster, Coney Island traded incoming sophomore Cheng to Ginebra for veteran Manny Victorino and acquired 1992 Rookie of the Year Bong Ravena from San Miguel in exchange for Kevin Ramas. The league gave an incentive to the champion of the said conference to have the honor of representing the country in the 1994 Asian Games in Hiroshima, Japan. But Coney Island lost in six games to San Miguel for the All-Filipino Cup title, thus forfeiting the opportunity. Nonetheless, when the Beermen line-up was decimated with several injuries to their key players, they had to reinforce with Purefoods' Patrimonio, Codiñera, and Evangelista. Johnny Abarrientos of Alaska was also included in the team that placed fourth in the Asian Games.\n\nIn the Commissioner's Cup, with Kenny Redfield as import, Purefoods won the title in a hard-fought series against the formidable Alaska Milkmen. Patrimonio won the Best Player of the Conference award, becoming only the second player (after teammate Jerry Codiñera who won it previously in the All-Filipino Cup) in PBA history to win the citation. Their reinforcement, Redfield took home the Best Import of the conference honors. It was also during this tournament that he was dubbed \"Triple-Double Artist\" by the media, as a testament to his all-around skills.\n\nPatrimonio won his second consecutive MVP and third overall. Evangelista was a prime candidate to win the Rookie of the Year award but lost to Swift's Boybits Victoria. Another disappointment for Evangelista was that he was not included in the All-Defensive Team, contrary to what was expected by most, especially the Purefoods fans.\n\nIn 1995, Purefoods failed to enter the championship of the three conferences allotted, showing only two fourth-place finishes in the All-Filipino and the Commissioner's Cup. It was the first time in the team's eight-year history that they failed to make it to the All-Filipino finals. It was also the first time that they didn't make any finals appearance in a single season.\n\nDuring the offseason, Purefoods retooled its lineup by drafting Rodney Santos and reacquiring former Purefoods players Pumaren and Tanuan through trades conducted with Pepsi and Sta. Lucia respectively.\n\nThe TJ Hotdogs met Alaska in the finals of the All-Filipino Conference in 1996 PBA season but was defeated in five games by the eventual grand slam winning Milkmen.\n\nIn the Governors' Cup, Purefoods struggled as they fielded in several imports in hopes of reversing their misfortunes. After the season, Reyes left the Purefoods team to become the head coach of Sta. Lucia Realty.\n\nIn 1997 PBA season, rookie coach Eric Altamirano took over as coach of the Purefoods Corned Beef Cowboys. In his very first conference, Purefoods won the All-Filipino Cup defeating the Gordon's Gin Boars in six games for their first title in three years.\n\nAfter a sorry performance in the Commissioner's Cup, the newly christened Purefoods Carne Norte Beefies lost in the finals of the Governors' Cup to Alaska, 4–1. Their import was the talented Mike Jones who lost in a battle for Best Import honors.\n\nPatrimonio won his fourth and final Most Valuable Player Award, tying former teammate and idol Ramon Fernandez for the most number of MVP awards won.\n\nAfter getting booted out of the semifinals of the 1998 All-Filipino Cup, Altamirano left Purefoods to join Mobiline. Chito Narvasa became his replacement but failed to lead Purefoods to a finals appearance.\n\nPurefoods struggled in the 1999 PBA season All-Filipino Cup despite acquiring Filipino-American Al Segova and a new head coach in Derrick Pumaren. During the Commissioner's Cup, Codiñera was traded to Mobiline for Andy Seigle. The trade ended the long-time partnership of Patrimonio and Codiñera, who was known as the \"Defense Minister.\" Segova was later banished after he was proven to be a fake Filipino-American. Purefoods failed to get past the quarterfinals of the first two conferences. They were ousted by Alaska Milk in a 3-game sweep despite finishing first at the end of the elimination round with a 7–1 card and lost their last 4 games after winning 6 in a row (8–1 record after the quarterfinals) in the season ending Governors' Cup. Derrick \"The Flight\" Brown led all imports in scoring and rebounding but was edged out by San Miguel import Lamont Strothers in the balloting for best import honors.\n\nIn the 2000 All-Filipino Cup, a forfeiture of games won by Tanduay Gold during the semifinals series (for fielding fake Filipino-American Sonny Alvarado in Games 2 and 3 won by the Rhum Masters) set the stage for Boyet Fernandez' buzzer beating shot in overtime of game 4. That shot catapulted the TJ Hotdogs to the finals, which they lost to Alaska.\n\nBrown won Best Import honors after leading the TJ Hotdogs to the finals of the Governors' Cup, which they lost to San Miguel. It was the second time that a Purefoods import won the said award. (Brown would go on to win a second one in 2002 in the same conference). Also, Patrimonio found his way back to the Mythical Five selection.\n\nPumaren left Purefoods after the 2000 season and signed up with Tanduay Gold. Replacing him was the returning Altamirano for his second tour of duty with Purefoods.\n\nA distraction affected the team off the court when the Ayala Corporation sold Pure Foods Corporation (including its PBA franchise) to San Miguel Corporation. The problem with this development was that SMC already had two PBA ballclubs in San Miguel Beer and Barangay Ginebra, and it was not allowed by the league for a company to own three teams in the league. This meant that either the Ayala group had to retain their team under a new banner or for SMC to disband the team after the season. Eventually, the PBA Board of Governors adjusted the rule and allowed the Purefoods PBA franchise to be acquired by SMC and to remain an active team.\n\nIn 2002, Pure Foods Corporation would be renamed San Miguel Pure Foods Company, Inc.\n\nThe TJ Hotdogs lost to Batang Red Bull 2–3 in a best-of-5 semifinals series. Despite their unexpected good showing in the Commissioner's Cup, they struggled in the last conference of the season, and never made it past the elimination round.\n\nNoy Castillo was named Most Improved Player of the 2001 season after leading the TJ Hotdogs in scoring throughout the year.\n\nIn 2002, they got Kerby Raymundo from Red Bull as the new main man for the team.\n\nAltamirano concentrated his duties with the national team in 2002 as an assistant coach. Taking over for a while was his assistant, Ryan Gregorio. Gregorio led Purefoods to a successful championship run in the Governors' Cup defeating Alaska in seven games after trailing 0–2. It marked the second time they've beaten Alaska in a finals series despite dropping the first two games. Kerby Raymundo, acquired from Red Bull prior to the start of the tournament, was the Finals MVP. Brown was the conference's Best Import while Evangelista was the Best Player of the Conference.\n\nHowever, Purefoods became a mediocre team in the Commissioner's Cup and the All-Filipino Cup finishing dead last in the succeeding conferences of the season.\n\nAfter the season, Ronnie Magsanoc won the Comeback Player of the Year Award and announced his retirement after he received the award. Gregorio and Coca-Cola mentor Chot Reyes was named co-winners of the Coach of the Year Award.\n\nIn 2003, Gregorio was named as the head coach of the team as Altamirano was reassigned to the traveling SMC All-Stars (composed of former PBA all-stars). Purefoods each failed to enter the quarterfinals of the three conferences. In the Reinforced Conference, they had former NBA protege Lenny Cooke, but Cooke later suffered an injury, causing the Hotdogs not to qualify for the quarterfinals. It was the first season that Purefoods failed to make the 20 win mark with a dismal 9–27 win loss card (a franchise low).\n\nThe Purefoods Tender Juicy Hotdogs acquired James Yap as the second overall draft pick in the 2004 PBA draft. Yap became the main man of the team that led Purefoods through the years. The former UE Red Warrior has won multiple Most Valuable Player awards. He is one of the most exciting players in the league and his partner PJ Simon the teams supersub and later on becomes an all star caliber player and nicknamed scoring apostle.\n\nDuring Patrimonio's birthday celebration on November 26, 2004 (Patrimonio's birthday was on November 17), he announced his retirement in an emotional speech, ending his illustrious 16-year career to concentrate his role as team manager. His number was retired in December, becoming the first Purefoods player to have his jersey retired. Purefoods was the only team Patrimonio played for in the PBA.\n\nThe rebuilding process began for Purefoods despite a dismal showing in the 2004 PBA Fiesta Conference. In the 2004–05 Philippine Cup, Purefoods was eliminated by Shell in the quarterfinals. Same can be said in the 2005 Fiesta Conference, when the Turbo Chargers eliminated them in the same predicament.\n\nPurefoods Chunkee Giants\n\nUniforms\n\nLight uniform\n\nDark uniform\n\nPrior to the start of the 2005–06 Fiesta Conference, Purefoods replaced their TJ Hotdogs moniker with the Chunkee Giants. The Chunkee Giants was a reference to the company's new chunky corned beef product Purefoods Chunkee Corned Beef. Purefoods selected PBL MVP Jondan Salvador with the fourth pick in the first round of the draft. To further strengthen its line-up, the team traded future draft picks to Air21 to acquire Marc Pingris and Egay Billones. They also signed veteran guard Roger Yap. They also hired Marquin Chandler as import and went on to record a 10–6 first-place finish in the classification phase, earning them an outright semis berth.\n\nThe Giants beat the up-and-coming Express in six games of the semifinals. They lost in the finals of the tournament to Red Bull in six games. But their runner-up finish was the best since winning the 2002 Governors' Cup. Chandler won Best Import honors while Raymundo lost to Enrico Villanueva for Best Player of the Conference honors.\n\nIn the 2006 PBA Philippine Cup, the Chunkee Giants finished with a 12–4 record and a first-place finish in the classification phase, earning them an outright semifinals berth for the second consecutive time. However, on May 14, in a game against Red Bull, Eugene Tejada suffered a freak injury, which resulted to his paralyzation. In the semifinals, Purefoods won the series in seven games after trailing Alaska 1–3, becoming only the second team since the 1991 Ginebra San Miguel team to come back from a 1–3 deficit in a PBA best-of-seven series. In six games, the Chunkee Giants won the 2006 Philippine Cup, 4–2, over Red Bull. It was Purefoods' first title since the 2002 Governors' Cup, and the first All-Filipino Cup title since 1997. Pingris was named as the Finals MVP.\n\nYap became the second Purefoods player to win season MVP award and was included in the Mythical Team. Raymundo and Roger Yap were also named to the mythical team\n\nIn the succeeding 2006–07 season, Purefoods managed to end up with a 10–8 win–loss record. In a playoff game for the second outright quarterfinals berth, the Giants came-from-behind to beat Sta. Lucia to avoid going further down to the grueling wild-card phase.\n\nIn the best-of-five quarterfinals, the Chunkee Giants lost to Talk 'N Text, 3–1. After Pingris got injured in game 2, Purefoods lost the next three games, thus failing to repeat as champions of the Philippine Cup.\n\nPurefoods renamed the team to the Tender Juicy Giants for the 2007 PBA Fiesta Conference. However, the team paraded a depleted line-up. Forward-centers Kerby Raymundo and Marc Pingris were loaned to the national team and placed on injured list, respectively. James Yap was also facing issues regarding his marital problems with wife Kris and being snubbed from the National Team. Although Marquin Chandler returned for a second tour of duty with Purefoods, the team had a badly depleted front line that saw them only Richard Yee and Arnold Gamboa manning the slot. Enter PJ Simon, the scoring apostle. he led the team in scoring, and the Giants decided to get the next big man available in the PBA to help the team. As a result, they acquired Rommel Adducul from the San Miguel Beermen through a three-team trade with the Red Bull Barako which also saw Enrico Villanueva donning a Beermen jersey. Reserve Don Camaso was the casualty of the trade as he was sent to Red Bull. Some PBA teams denounced the trade transaction because of the \"restricted player\" trade rule in which only top players could be traded for one another to avoid imbalance in the league. But the protests quickly subsided after the PBA approved the said trade after learning that Villanueva was removed from the restricted list and Adducul was finally allowed to play for the Giants.\n\nPurefoods was able to escape early elimination after beating the Welcoat Dragons in the last elimination round game. James Yap scored 41 points to lead the Giants to the wildcard phase, only to be knocked out by the Coca-Cola Tigers where he scored 40 points, which equaled former PBA player Nelson Asaytono's record of scoring 40+ points in back-to-back games, but failed to deliver the win for the team. For his efforts, Yap was picked by Chot Reyes to be part of the national team to play for the 2007 FIBA Asia Championship in Tokushima, Japan where the Philippines finished ninth out of the 16 teams.\n\nWith no picks in the 2007 PBA draft, the TJ Giants welcomed back Raymundo and Pingris to the team, while trading Paul Artadi to the Air21 Express for virtually nothing after a feud with the coaches (Artadi ended up playing in Ginebra). The Giants then had a 7–0 start at the 2007–08 PBA Philippine Cup with Yap having a banner conference. Despite losing the Christmas Day game against fierce rival Barangay Ginebra Kings, the Giants clinched the semifinals berth and the #1 seed on their next game thanks to a win against the Tigers. In the semifinals, they were up against Red Bull, the winner over the Magnolia Beverage Masters in the quarterfinals series. The Giants drew first blood in the semifinals by routing Red Bull but needed to win the 7th game to finally clinch their 12th AFC finals stint (the most by any team in history) against Sta. Lucia.\n\nPurefoods lost a controversial 7 game series with Yap serving a suspension in game 5 after the Giants had come back a 0–2 deficit to tie the series at 2–2. They managed to level the series at 3–3 thanks to a classic fourth quarter performance by James Yap, nailing 5 of 6 three point attempts and scoring 20 points in the fourth quarter. Game 7 was almost a carbon copy of game number 6. Purefoods struggled in the third quarter with key players in foul trouble, and in the end it was Sta. Lucia who made the crucial shots down the stretch and won the game 100–88.\n\nBefore the start of the succeeding Fiesta Conference, Rommel Adducul was diagnosed with cancer and had to take a leave of absence. Lacking a starting center, Purefoods was forced to make a deal for Enrico Villanueva and sacrifice Marc Pingris, who went to the Magnolia Beverage Masters in a four-team, multi-player transaction. For their reinforcement, they tapped the services of 6'11\" Darius Rice. Rice was a prolific scorer but was not able to lead the team to enough wins for the Giants to keep him. He was replaced by Moroccan Reda Rhalimi, who was decent enough on both ends of the floor, but was also unable to lead the Giants to an impressive finish. They ended up with a 7–11 win–loss card in the classification phase.\n\nThe knockout wildcard match-up against Talk 'N Text accentuated the frustrations that have marked the Giants' campaign. With the team trailing by 16 points halfway through the fourth, Jondan Salvador got involved in an altercation against the Phone Pals' import Terrence Leather. After the import threw the ball at Salvador, Yap retaliated with a kick, which in turn caused players from both benches to join the fray. With the situation almost resulting in a disastrous brawl, cooler heads eventually prevailed, penalties were given and the game came to an end—as well as the Giants' season.\n\nThe controversial blow-out loss at the Ynares center turned out to be the last game of Castillo and Evangelista as professional basketball players. Castillo retired while Evangelista joined the Giants' coaching staff. Evangelista played his entire career with the Purefoods franchise that drafted him second overall in 1994. He won four championships with Purefoods and was known as a solid defender and rebounder. Castillo, on the other hand, was dreaded for his clutch baskets and was a consistent marksman throughout his career. He won a championship with the team in 2006 PBA Philippine Cup.\n\nBefore the start of the 2008–2009 KFC PBA Philippine Cup, the TJ Giants and their fans once again got into trouble with the Singapore Slingers audience during an exhibition game. The Giants lost to the Slingers in that heated match, but ironically, they signed Slinger Al Vergara for a single conference contract in the 2009 Motolite PBA Fiesta Conference.\n\nIn the off-season, Purefoods overhauled its roster by bringing in rookies Beau Belga, Jonathan Fernandez, and Richard Alonzo. They also acquired veterans Topex Robinson and Paolo Bugia from Red Bull and Aaron Aban from Alaska. These moves, however, were all futile attempts at establishing team chemistry as the team failed to excel at the classification phase, even after acquiring Rich Alvarez in mid-conference and having Adducul back from cancer treatment.\n\nHaving to play in yet another wildcard phase, the Giants continued their struggle in the 2008–2009 Philippine Cup. During a timeout in a knockout game against Air21, Yap and Purefoods assistant coach Koy Banal exchanged harsh words which caused a stir in the team's huddle. Moments later, Raymundo rushed to the other side of the court to confront Air21 fans. The Express went on to win the game, ending the Purefoods' campaign.\n\nTo settle the issue between Yap and Banal, the team's officials called for an emergency meeting right after the loss to Air21. The whole team stayed up late to talk things over, and the two eventually reconciled.\n\nBefore the start of the 2009 Motolite PBA Fiesta Conference, the team made a move in a three-way trade with Ginebra and Burger King, they let go of the young players remaining in their roster---Beau Belga, Chad Alonzo, and Chico Lañete. In return, they got grizzled veterans Don Allado and Niño Canaleta. They also signed free agent Al Vergara of the Singapore Slingers for a one-conference contract.\n\nWith resident import Marquin Chandler still playing in Korea, the Giants brought in Brian Hamilton, who led them to an impressive 2–0 start but was eventually replaced by Jhamar Thorpe after a mediocre showing. Thorpe also turned out to be sub-par and was thus replaced by the original choice Chandler, who led the team to three straight victories upon his return, only to see it lose the next three.\n\nJust before the All-Star break, the management continued to tinker with the team's roster. In another transaction involving the Gin Kings and the Whoppers, the Giants acquired veteran point guard Celino Cruz and gave up Aaron Aban. To make room for Cruz in its roster, the team released Vergara from his duties.\n\nDuring the All-Star break, Yap won the three-point shootout. Canaleta, who won the Slam Dunk competition three times when he was with Air21, failed to get back the title. Raymundo and Yap were key performers for the Powerade-Team Pilipinas in their three-game exhibition match with the PBA All-stars. Villanueva and Simon played for the North and South All-Stars respectively.\n\nWith a 7–7 win–loss card, the Giants faced Talk 'N Text in a knockout wildcard duel. Even with Chandler fouling out in the fourth quarter, the Giants' local crew kept the game close, trailing by only three points, 97–100, with seven seconds left. Raymundo was fouled while shooting a desperation three-pointer that tied the game at 100-all, but he missed the potential game-winning free throw with 1.7 seconds left. In the extension period, Purefoods appeared to have sealed the victory with Roger Yap sinking two free throws to increase their lead to twelve, 114–102, with less than two minutes remaining. But Mark Cardona and Ren-Ren Ritualo made four consecutive triples for the Tropang Texters to force another overtime. The Giants, however resilient the Tropang Texters were, prevailed at the end behind the heroics of the Yap duo. The victory earned Purefoods the last ticket to the quarterfinals against Rain or Shine.\n\nWith tired players, Purefoods lost to the Elasto Painters in Game 1 of the quarterfinals. The following game, the Giants came back strong, leading by as much as 24 points late in the third. Nonetheless, Rain or Shine did not readily gave up, shutting the Giants' offense down and eventually tying the game with 22 seconds to go. Jai Lewis missed the possible go-ahead free throw, giving the Giants a chance to score the winning basket with the shot clock turned off. Chandler drove to the basket, got fouled, and drained two free throws with 1.2 seconds left. Off the timeout, Rob Wainwright missed the jumper and Purefoods tied the series.\n\nGame 3 saw the Giants leading most of the second half, behind Simon's high scoring game. Chandler was benched after letting his emotions get the best of him in the first half. He never saw action again in the second half, where Rain or Shine kept the game close. This paved the way for TY Tang to sink the go-ahead three-pointer with 31.2 seconds left. With the loss, Purefoods were denied a slot in the semifinals and their long off-season began.\n\nAfter a dismal performance in the 34th PBA season, the Giants geared up for a promising 35th by figuring in big transactions in the off-season. First, they re-acquired the services of 2006 Finals MVP Marc Pingris by giving up future picks to Burger King. The Whoppers earlier acquired Pingris from San Miguel in the Arwind Santos trade. Within the next two days, Pingris was eventually shipped back to Purefoods on the said follow-up deal in exchange for a draft pick.\n\nAnother cause for optimism in the Purefoods organization is having the second overall pick of the 2009 PBA draft. Amid rumors of giving up marquee players to Burger King to get top prospect Japeth Aguilar first overall, the Giants eventually called the negotiations off and settled for no. 2 at the draft. Thus, Aguilar went to the Whoppers, while the Giants picked former De La Salle University Archer Rico Maierhofer.\n\nIn an effort to solve the duplications in several positions, the Giants engaged in a multi-player deal with sister team Barangay Ginebra. Burger King was willing to act as the conduit for this intra-company exchange, and thus the player carousel began. The Gin Kings bulked up their frontline by acquiring Enrico Villanueva, Paolo Bugia, and Rich Alvarez from Purefoods. They also deepened their backcourt rotation by taking Celino Cruz from the Giants and Pocholo Villanueva from the Whoppers. The Giants got Rafi Reavis, Paul Artadi, and Chris Timberlake. The Whoppers also landed rookie Orlando Daroya who was the Gin Kings' first round choice.\n\nDespite the roster build-up in the offseason, the Giants had a roller coaster ride in the first round of the Classification Phase of the 2009–2010 KFC PBA Philippine Cup. They struggled to win back-to-back games even with its balanced line-up and an impressive performance by the rookie Rico Maierhofer. They won the season opener (October 11) against Burger King, but lost some games in dismal fashion, including an upset by the Asi Taulava-less Coke Tigers just before the Halloween break. They ended the first round with a mediocre 5–4 record, capped by a win over Sta. Lucia in an out-of-town game.\n\nPurefoods, whom many people dubbed as one of the teams to beat for the said tournament, finally scored back-to-back wins on December 2 against Coca-Cola. During the same gameday, Purefoods-Hormel celebrated 10 years of partnership. The event saw the unveiling of TJ, the new team mascot, a halftime show for the kids, and the Giants wearing commemorative jerseys. Purefoods strung up two more wins against Brgy. Ginebra and Barako Bull to extend its winning streak to four.\n\nPowerhouse San Miguel put an end to the Giants' streak in mid-December. As it was the second time the Beermeen dominated the Giants, and league-leading Alaska also defeated the team in the first round, doubts were raised whether Purefoods could really hold its own against the contenders. The team also lost to Talk N' Text just before the Christmas break, dampening its hopes of securing one of the two outright semifinal slots.\n\nPurefoods bounced back from its consecutive losses by beating Burger King on Christmas Day. They followed it up with a no-bearing win against the guest team, Smart Gilas to start the New Year. Purefoods also swept the rest of its schedule, with the streak highlighted by a convincing win over the league-leading Alaska on January 15. Because Alaska and San Miguel did well in the first round of the Eliminations, the Giants failed to steal an outright semifinal slot from the Aces, who needed to win their last scheduled game to avoid a tie-breaker with Purefoods. The Giants ended the classification phase with a record of 12–6, third overall in the standings, which gave them an outright quarterfinal slot. In the quarters, the Giants extended their win streak to six by winning the first two games of their series with Rain or Shine.\n\nThe Elasto Painters came back strong to win games 3 and 4 and force a do-or-die game 5. Purefoods had a hard time guarding outside snipers like Jeff Chan and Mike Hrabak in game 3. In game 4, the Giants rallied to overcome a 16-point 4th Quarter deficit, to snatch the lead with a minute to go. But Eddie Laure hit a well-defended three-pointer to put Rain or Shine back on top, and the Giants failed to score another point. The struggle continued through the first half of game 5, before the Giants eventually realized they are the better team, and put the series away for good.\n\nAfter a near-death experience with the Elasto Painters, the Giants found themselves on a collision course with second seed San Miguel Beer for a best-of-seven semifinal series. The Beermen took game 1 with ease, but the Giants adjusted well in game 2 to even the series. In game 3, the Beermen once again won by a huge margin, causing everyone to think that they had already taken control of the series. Little did they know that the Giants, led by Roger Yap's and James Yap's POW performances would win the next three games en route to their 13th All-Filipino finals appearance in franchise history.\n\nSweeps are usually uneventful match-ups, with a superior team bullying the other into lopsided games. This was not the case in the Purefoods-Alaska series wherein Purefoods led by no more than 3 points in its first three wins. In game 2, a controversial call occurred when Kerby Raymundo got Joe DeVance to bite into his shot fake causing a slight contact with 1.7 seconds left and the game was tied. Arguments were raised whether the contact was enough to merit a call, but the referees eventually decided on a foul and awarded Raymundo two free throws, the first of which he made; the second he intentionally missed. In game 3, Willie Miller of Alaska had a chance to steal the victory in the dying seconds, but missed a possible game-winner at the buzzer. With their tough defense and a deeper rotation, the Giants cruised to a convincing game 4 victory, sealing the series and claiming their 8th title. It was also their 5th All-Filipino title, tying Crispa for most number of championships in that prestigious tournament.\n\nJust before the game, James Yap was awarded the Best Player of the Conference plaque. Later that night, he also took home the Finals MVP award.\n\nIn March 2010, SMC announced that Purefoods Tender Juicy Giants were to be renamed as the B-Meg Derby Ace Llamados starting 2010 PBA Fiesta Conference.[3] The team's name was shortened to B-Meg Llamados starting the 2011 PBA Governors Cup.\n\nB-Meg Llamados\n\nColors Uniforms\n\nLight uniform\n\nDark uniform\n\nOn June 1, 2011 B-Meg Llamados offered Air21 a 2-on-1 deal; it will be Jondan Salvador and multi-titled slam dunk champion KG Canaleta for top 2007 PBA Draftee Joe Devance. Devance, a former University of Texas-El Paso stalwart, was shipped by Alaska to the Express for Jay-R Reyes on May 28, 2011. On June 3, 2011, PBA commissioner Chito Salud approved a Devance trade to B-Meg. After two days of studying the trade transaction, Salud approved the two-team, three-player deal. \"Two big men in exchange for Devance? I think that's fair enough,\" he told GMA News. \"But it took me two days before I finally made a decision because I wanted to carefully study the trade. In the end, I felt the trade is fair both squads.\"[4]\n\nMulti-titled veteran PBA coach Tim Cone signed as the head coach with champion team, B-Meg.\n\nOn October 5, 2011, Cone made his debut as B-Meg's head coach against Petron Blaze.

B-Meg was down by two 74–76 with 1.2 seconds remaining, when Denzel Bowles hit the game-tying two free throws to the delight of the mammoth Sunday crowd of 21,046 at the Smart Araneta Coliseum. Late in the game between the Texters and the Llamados, there was confusion amid the roar of the crowd, as people thought the game was already over, and just like in 1980, a banner bearing the name of Talk 'N Text was already brought out at the Smart Araneta Coliseum. It turned out that the Llamados still had a lease on life, as Bowles was fouled by Kelly Williams with 1.7 seconds left. The 23-year-old import made both of his free throws to send the game into overtime, where B-Meg pounced on the shorthanded TNT team for their 9th title. [5]\n\nDevance and Intal weren't able to play much because of injuries but B-Meg once again booked a ticket to the 2012 Governors' Cup Finals against Rain or Shine after beating Barangay Ginebra, 74–72 courtesy of a Peter June Simon follow up. B-Meg dropped their first game 91–80, but the resilient Llamados bounced back and defeated Rain or Shine 85–80, where Yap was named Best Player of the Game with 24 pts, 9 rebound performance. But B-Meg lost two straight with a 93–84 (where Cone benched his superstars in the final quarter and put Marqus Blakey and Pingris back in just few minutes remaining) and 94–89 respectively and RoS led the series 3–1. But Yap exploded for a conference high 57 points and dedicated his performance to the late former President Corazon Aquino, his former mother-in-law as they defeated the E-Painters,91–81. He scored again with 20 pts in the crucial Game 6 and they won in convincing fashion, 97–81 to tie the series at 3-all with Simon being hailed as the Best Player of the Game. B-Meg looks to be the 4th team to come back from a 1–3 deficit (they accomplished this in 2006). They also look for their first back-to-back championships. However, the Elasto Painters fought hard in Game 7 and defeated B-Meg, 83–76 despite Yap's 23 point performance. The Llamados have missed crucial shots during crunch and their import Blakely being fouled out early in the fourth quarter and Rain or Shine took advantage.\n\nPrior to the start of the 2012–13 PBA season, San Miguel Pure Foods Company, Inc. announced that the team will play under the name San Mig Coffee Mixers.[6] The following season, the team was named San Mig Super Coffee Mixers.\n\nThey finished the eliminations with a 10–4 record, grabbing the second seed with the twice to beat, they passed the quarterfinals by winning against Petron Blaze on a twice to beat advantage, but failed to reach the finals by losing against Rain or Shine, 2 to 4.\n\nThey finished the eliminations with 8 wins and 6 losses, good for fourth seed, They lost the first game to Meralco on a best-of-three quarterfinals series, they need to win two straight to win the series, they won game two and three, to take it.

Ian Sangalang was picked No. 2 overall by the Super Coffee Mixers together with Justin Chua, Justin Melton and JR Cawaling. A few days after the draft, Chua was eventually traded to GlobalPort in exchange for Isaac Holstein, the seventh pick overall of GlobalPort.\n\nDue to a series of injuries that plagued the team at the start of the season together with the recently concluded Governors' Cup Finals that gave them barely a week to prepare for the Philippine Cup, the Super Coffee Mixers struggled to get back to championship form. This resulted to an awful 0–3 start, losing against Barangay Ginebra San Miguel on the opening day, Alaska and Petron Blaze before notching their first win against Air21.
