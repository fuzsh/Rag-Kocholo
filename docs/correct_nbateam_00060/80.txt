Former NBA great Metta World Peace took to Instagram live with some fans recently and was asked about the favorite team he played for, which ultimately came down to the Los Angeles Lakers and the Indiana Pacers.

However, World Peace, formerly known as Ron Artest, didn't give us quite a straightforward answer and hilariously teased us about his favorite team.

Way to leave us hanging.

While answering, the 6-foot-7 forward did note his short 29-game stint with the New York Knicks 2013-14. Nonetheless, when looking back at his 17-year career, Metta World Peace played arguably his best basketball with the Lakers and the Pacers.

Apart from the three aforementioned teams, World Peace also played with the Chicago Bulls, the Sacramento Kings, and the Houston Rockets. The four-time All-Defensive team forward spent six seasons with the Purple and Gold, including two near the end of his career. Meanwhile, he played in Indiana from the midway point of the 2001-02 season through the first few months of the 2005-06 season.

World Peace undoubtedly experienced his best team success with the Lakers, especially in his first stint in the earlier part of the previous decade. The enigmatic defensive star played a key role in their championship run in 2010. He also knocked down the crucial trey in Game 7 of their classic Finals series against the Boston Celtics that sealed the 16th NBA championship in Lakers franchise history.

On the one hand, World Peace enjoyed the best individual success with the Pacers. He won the 2003-04 Defensive Player of the Year award with Indiana, while also making the All-Star team and the All-NBA Third Team.
