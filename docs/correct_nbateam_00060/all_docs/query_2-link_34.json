        "text": "Editorâs Note:Â On September 24, the Los Angeles Lakers announced that they had re-signed Metta World Peace. IM went looking for the former All-Star forwardâthen known as Ron Artestâafter he left the Indiana Pacers, as chronicled in this November 2007 account.\n\nJust where, exactly, is Ron Artest?\n\nThe most obvious answer is that he is in California, starting his second full season with the Sacramento Kings, where he has averaged more than 18 points a gameâthat is to say, since the erratic forward left the Indiana Pacers two years ago, after almost single-handedly dragging the team into a public image slump, he has not really been âhere.”\n\nAs correct as that description may be, however, the reality of Artestâs presence lingers. Pacers representatives say theyâve recovered from his four years with the teamâa tenure marred by frequent game suspensions, bizarre public theatrics, enraged outbursts, locker-room divisions, and, most devastatingly, The Brawl. This month, they say, when the Pacers launch a new season with a new coach, new players, and a new no-nonsense attitude, fresh air will fill Conseco Fieldhouse and then, as Donnie Walsh, CEO of Pacers Sports & Entertainment, puts it, the Artest Era will be something they are simply âtrying to move past.â\n\nBut there is a longer answer. Artest has a house in Zionsville. Kids in school here. An affinity for his days as a Pacer. An on-again, off-again plan to return to Indianapolis when his playing days are done. And, in spite of all that has transpired between them, fond relationships with those he left behind. Walsh, for instance, still refers to Artest as âRonnieâ and calls the volatile player a ânice young man.â When I interviewed Walsh in his Conseco office shortly before the start of the current NBA season, he noted that Artest was a little closer than most fans might think. âI just saw him today,â Walsh said. âHe was in here, shooting.â\n\nIn Indianapolis, Artest is far from forgotten. And, in some ways, he isnât even gone.\n\nThe season the Pacers faithful will always associate with Artestâs antics began as one of the organizationâs most auspicious. The team had fallen just short of the NBA Finals the previous season and entered the 2004-2005 campaign with a core of blossoming stars, including the veteran shooting hand of Reggie Miller. No single player aroused higher expectations than Ron Artest, the ferociously competitive forward who was, at his best, one of the NBAâs top defenders, most versatile scorers, and toughest SOBs.\n\nThe Pacers were rolling as they headed into their ninth game of the seasonâa November 19 showdown at the Palace of Auburn Hills against the Detroit Pistons, who had bounced Indiana from the playoffs the previous season. Led by the indomitable Artest, the Pacers punished the defending champs and took a decisive lead into the final minutes of the contest. Just a few more ticks, and the Pacers would leave the floor with a claim to the mantle of top contender.\n\nPacer fans know what happened next: A routine shove on the court that planted Artest on the scorerâs table, shooting the refs a âWho, me?â grin. Then, a flying plastic cup of beer. A flash of rage across Artestâs face. A vault up several rows of seats. Wild swings at a group of fans.\n\nHostile spectators rushed the court, and panicked Pacers, momentarily forgetting their reputation as one of the NBAâs model franchises, fought them off with giant closed fists. In the middle of it all was Artest.\n\nâOf course, the event itself was a tough thing to go through,â says Walsh.\n\nâBut you could mark that night as the beginning of a period that was not good for our franchise. It really hurt us dramatically.â Never mind the player suspensionsâmost notably Artestâs season-long banishment. âWhat a lot of people donât realize is that until last year, players were still going through criminal-court cases from that night,â says Walsh. âThat fragmented the team. And it brought in a period of us having to react to a lot of negativity.â\n\nAll-star forward Jermaine OâNeal contends that the spectacle placed the team at a competitive disadvantage for years to come. âWeâve gotten officiated wrongfully since The Brawl,â he says.\n\nWhen the next season commenced, Larry Bird, the Pacersâ president of basketball operations, allowed Artest to return to the court, even appearing with Artest on the cover of Sports Illustrated, standingâliterallyâbehind his player. Then, on December 10, in response to unsubstantiated trade rumors, Artest showed his appreciation for the Pacersâ support by telling The Indianapolis Star that heâd like to be dealt to another team, ostensibly because he wanted to find a fresh start. He made his comments without consulting his bosses first.\n\nâRon comes out and asks for a trade,â says Jeff Foster, one of the few Pacers not suspended after The Brawl. âHe kind of turned his back on all of usâhis teammates and the organization, and they had stood behind him.â\n\nApparently dumbfounded, Coach Rick Carlisle dropped Artest from the active roster, eventually exchanging him for Peja Stojakovic, a vastly inferior player by almost any measure. The trade was disappointing for the Pacers, but in the margins of the deal was a sigh of relief for getting anything at all in return for damaged goods like Artest. He was now somebody elseâs problem.\n\nStill, the Pacersâ problems didnât stop with his departure. In an organization long accustomed to squeaky-clean PR, Artest seemed to have turned a barking pack of chaos loose on the organization. âThings have been downhill after that,â says Foster. âThen all the other things started happening off-court.â\n\nThings like the player skirmish at Club Rio, a âgentlemenâs club,â which ended with guard Stephen Jackson discharging a handgun in the parking lot; allegations that point guard Jamaal Tinsley, accompanied by two other Pacers, assaulted a manager at 8 Seconds Saloon; and, most recently, the arrest of forward Shawne Williams on charges of marijuana possession, driving without a license, and other offenses.\n\nâArtest didnât make Stephen Jackson go to a strip club and shoot his gun in the air,â says Sam Amick, who covers the Kings for the Sacramento Bee. â[But] it is absolutely correct to trace back to Artest the beginning of a rough stretch for the Pacers.â\n\nIn Sacramento, on the other hand, Artest seemed to find the fresh start he wantedâat least at first. He gave the flagging Kings a jumpstart and nearly helped his new team pull off a playoff upset of the heavily favored San Antonio Spurs. As with his earliest exposure to Indiana fans, his game toughness quickly endeared him to the Sacramento faithful.\n\nâIt was hoped that in Sacramento he would flourish,â says Amick. âThe Maloof brothers [who purchased the Kings with the fortune they made building casinos] didnât think Ron was as wacky as the rest of the country did. They called it a gamble. Theyâre from Vegas-thatâs what they do.\n\nâBut,â he adds, âthings have not gone as smoothly as they wanted.â\n\nSadly, the most glaring parallel between Artestâs time in Indiana and his tenure in Sacramento has emerged over the past year: First came the inevitable outbursts, followed by eye-rolling from his new teammates. Then, early last season, reports surfaced that authorities had found Artestâs neglected and half-starved dog at his Sacramento-area home, and that sheriffâs deputies had made at least a half-dozen runs to Artestâs property on domestic-disturbance complaints, one of which ended in Artestâs arrest. The Kings werenât winning, either, and the distraction of Artest, says Amick, âwas a big part of the formula of what didnât work for the team.â\n\nAs the situation soured in Sacramento, Artest kept his estate off State Road 421, in Zionsville. The main house, a brick-fronted mansion, sits on a curving paved driveway far back from the road, separated from the prying public by a black steel fence and a sliding gate controlled by an electronic lockbox. On adjoining lots sit two smaller ranch-style homes that Artest bought later and incorporated into the main estate. Together, the three properties form a kind of rural fenced compound.\n\nThe estate would come to serve as a family refuge, at least according to a neighbor who owns a home that sits between Artestâs two smaller houses, and who wished to remain anonymous. When Artestâs marital relations reached their nadir in Sacramento, Artestâs neighbor says, the playerâs wife and children retreated to the Indiana home. Artest told reporters this summer that he has made the sprawling Zionsville mansion his permanent base, and that he hoped Indiana would remain his home even after he retires.\n\nBut even in the innocuous, Artest remains difficult to pin down. Last year, he listed all three of the Zionsville properties for sale, and they remained on the market through September, when the listings expired. His real-estate agent, Regina Jones, says that in spite of having fielded several inquiries, the listings will not be renewed. âHe wants to remain in Indianapolis,â she says. âI know that he and his family like living here.â\n\nAttempts to contact Artest through the Kings, the Pacers, his agent, and at the gate of his Zionsville home were unsuccessful. âHe pulled me aside a few weeks ago and told me he wants to limit his interviews,â says Kings spokesman Darrin May. âHe wants to concentrate on basketball right now.â\n\nIn June, however, Artestâs business manager did approach the playerâs neighbor about selling his house. But after the neighbor agreed and completed some preliminary paperwork, no one contacted him about closing the transaction. Still, the neighbor says, âas far as Iâm concerned, heâs a good guy. And I still think heâs the best basketball player who ever played the game.â\n\nThe Pacers, too, have a soft spot for Artest. From Bobby âSlickâ Leonard, Pacers radio analyst and former head coach: âI like Ronnieâa lot of people around here like Ronnie. Ronnie was just young, and those were mistakes that he made.â\n\nFrom Foster, the player who was stunned by The Brawl but flabbergasted by Artestâs request for a trade: âI donât think anybody who has ever played with Ron has any animosity toward him. Heâs actually a really good guy. Heâs nice to be around. He just has his moments on the court where, for whatever reason, he lets the game get the best of him.â\n\nAnd from guard Jamaal Tinsley: âI miss him a lot, both as a basketball player and a friend.â\n\nFor fans in Central Indiana, Artestâs name will probably always be synonymous with bad behavior. But Amick says Artest recalls Indianapolis more fondly than the city remembers him.\n\nâWhen Ron talks about his days with the Pacers, he gets kind of animated, even wistful,â he says. âHe talks about the team they had, all the great players in the lineup. He still thinks they could have won a championship.â"
