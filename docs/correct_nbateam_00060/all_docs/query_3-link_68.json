        "text": "Cooper Neill/Getty Images\n\nThe NBA announced participants Wednesday for the 2024 NBA All-Star Celebrity Game, which will be played on Feb. 16 in Indianapolis.\n\nHeadlining the rosters are Dallas Cowboys linebacker Micah Parsons, who has been a three-time Pro Bowler and two-time first-team All-Pro during his three-year NFL career, and sensational rookie quarterback C.J. Stroud of the Houston Texans:\n\nESPN and the NBA announced in a joint press release that Parsons and Stroud will be joined by a few other star athletes in former NBA player Metta World Peace, IndyCar driver Conor Daly, Olympic high jumper Gianmarco Tamberi and WNBA stars Jewell Loyd and Natasha Cloud.\n\nAlso competing in the NBA All-Star Celebrity Game are musicians AJ McLean, Anuel AA, Walker Hayes, SiR and Adam Blackstone, actors Dylan Wang and Quincy Isaiah, actor and musician Jennifer Hudson, streamer Kai Cenat, chef Kwame Onwuachi and entertainers Tristan Jass and Jack Ryan.\n\nParticipating celebrities will be split into Team Shannon and Team Stephen A, with Pro Football Hall of Famers Shannon Sharpe and Peyton Manning and rapper 50 Cent coaching one team, and ESPN personality Stephen A. Smith, WNBA star A'ja Wilson and rapper Lil Wayne coaching the other:\n\nParsons has a basketball background, as he played varsity basketball in addition to football at Harrisburg High School in Harrisburg, Pennsylvania, before starring collegiately at Penn State and then getting drafted into the NFL.\n\nThe 24-year-old Parsons set a new career high in 2023 with 14 sacks this season after posting 13 as a rookie and 13.5 last season.\n\nParsons won the NFL Defensive Rookie of the Year Award in 2021 and finished second in NFL Defensive Player of the Year Award voting in each of his first two seasons, and he is a DPOY finalist once again this season.\n\nStroud, 22, is the front-runner for NFL Offensive Rookie of the Year honors, as he threw for 4,108 yards, 23 touchdowns and five interceptions in his debut season en route to a Pro Bowl. He also led the Texans to an AFC South title and a playoff win after they went just 3-13-1 in 2022.\n\nMetta World Peace, who formerly went by the name Ron Artest, starred in the NBA for 17 seasons, primarily with the Los Angeles Lakers and Indiana Pacers. He was a one-time All-Star, one-time NBA Defensive Player of the Year and one-time NBA champion.\n\nLoyd is a five-time WNBA All-Star and two-time WNBA champion, Cloud is a one-time WNBA champion, Tamberi won gold in the Olympic high jump in 2020 and Daly has three career top-10 finishes in the Indianapolis 500."
