        "text": "Subscribe to Posted Up with Chris Haynes\n\nApple Podcasts • Spotify • Stitcher • Google Podcasts\n\nIndiana Pacers, Chicago Bulls and Los Angeles Lakers great Metta Sandiford-Artest, aka Metta World Peace, joins the season premiere of Posted Up with Chris Haynes.\n\nThe NBA champion and defensive player of the year reflects on his eighteen-year career, turning from one of Kobe Bryant's rivals into one of his teammates and how he feels about the league's new rule changes around fouls.\n\nLater, Metta reflects on the infamous Malice at the Palace and his current relationship with two of the other main figures in that altercation: Jermaine O'Neal and Ben Wallace.\n\nChris & Metta close out the podcast chatting about Facebook's announcement that it would change its company's name to Meta. What at first was a funny coincidence that caused the NBA star to go viral last week turns into a conversation about the meaning of the word \"meta\" and why Artest is happy for the company and perhaps understands the relevance of this name change more than anyone else in the world.\n\nCheck out Metta's podcast \"Mettaphorically Speaking\" on Apple Podcasts, and download the XvsX Sports app - co-founded by World Peace himself - from the App Store and Google Play and visit xvsxsports.com.\n\nStay up to date with the latest NBA news and coverage from Yahoo Sports on Twitter @YahooSportsNBA.\n\nFollow Chris @ChrisBHaynes"
