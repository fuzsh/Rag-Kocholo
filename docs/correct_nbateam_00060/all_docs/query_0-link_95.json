        "text": "Metta World Peace couldn’t hide his ear-to-ear grin. “I bet people thought I was gone. But I think now, people know I’m back. I think now, you’ve got to mention me in your shoot-around plan,” the Los Angeles Lakers forward recently told ESPN.com following a string of strong performances during an East Coast road trip.\n\nHe stayed in shape, but reviving his NBA career wasn’t a given. “I wasn’t expecting a call from anybody, to tell you the truth,” he said. But then World Peace, who turned 36 last week, received a call from the Lakers, the team he played for from 2009-2013 and won a championship with in 2010.\n\n“[World Peace] is playing as well as anybody on their team right now,” said Mavericks coach Rick Carlisle, who coached World Peace — then known as Ron Artest — with the Indiana Pacers. “The guy’s a machine. He’s always been a real high-level player. He’s in great condition. That’s clear to see. He’s ready to go, man. He’s ready to go. He’s a big factor at both ends of the floor.”"
