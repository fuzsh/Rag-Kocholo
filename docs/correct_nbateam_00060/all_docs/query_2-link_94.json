        "text": "Former NBA players Metta Sandiford-Artest and Stephen Jackson looked back on the \"Malice at the Palace\" incident from 2004 on Monday, providing a behind-the-scenes perspective from the brawl between the Indiana Pacers and Detroit Pistons during an episode of Showtime's \"All the Smoke.\"\n\nThe bench-clearing brawl at The Palace in Auburn Hills, Michigan, saw Sandiford-Artest, formerly known as Ron Artest and Metta World Peace, suspended for 73 regular-season games and Jackson suspended for 30 games. All in all, a combined nine Pacers and Pistons players were suspended a total of 146 games.\n\nSandiford-Artest went into the stands after an alcoholic beverage was thrown at his head while he was cooling down on the scorer's table following an altercation with Pistons All-Star center Ben Wallace. Sandiford-Artest immediately responded by charging at the fan.\n\nIMPORTANT INFO: Start date for free agency, salary cap established for 2020-21 NBA season\n\n\"I didn't go up there to hit him,\" Sandiford-Artest said on the podcast. \"I went up there to shake him like, 'yo' like a real good shake. ... Like, why'd you throw a beer at my face, bro?\"\n\nAfter that initial altercation between Sandiford-Artest and the fan, a massive brawl broke out that saw spectators go onto the court.\n\nJackson chimed in on jumping in to fight when the fans came onto the court: \"I couldn't let that (expletive) ride.\"\n\nSandiford-Artest responded, \"Yo, listen, I never wanted you to do that.\"\n\nSandiford-Artest and Jackson said it was the first time recounting the specifics of the incident together.\n\nThe NBA in 2005 implemented a rule to limit the sale of alcohol in games. Jackson said of the fans' part in the brawl: \"They started it.\"\n\nJackson then added that the referees were at least partially to blame: \"(The brawl) (expletive) up our whole season. We didn't deserve that. At the end of the day, we were at work. A beer came out of the stands. Referees did a horrible job. They should've done a better good job escorting off the court. Instead they let it linger so long that the fans got into it.\"\n\nBoth players then revisited a funny moment in the locker room after what is known as the biggest brawl in NBA history.\n\n\"(Sandiford-Artest) looks at me and goes, 'You think we gonna be in trouble?' I was like, we might not have a job after this, son.'\"\n\n\"I looked at you and was like, you right,\" Sandiford-Artest replied."
