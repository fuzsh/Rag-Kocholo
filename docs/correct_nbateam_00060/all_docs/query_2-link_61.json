        "text": "Indianapolis, IN---At a press conference held today in Los Angeles, CA, Metta World Peace (formerly known as Ron Artest) announced he has donated $40,000 to Community Health Network Foundation, earmarked to expand behavioral health services to Central Indiana students.\n\nThe announcement of this donation was just one of eight gifts totaling $299,000 that World Peace and his nonprofit organization, Xcel University, is making to mental health providers throughout the country. Community Health Network is one of three Indiana health care providers to receive a donation.\n\nThe donation was made possible from the proceeds of the “Win My Bling” raffle, where the former Indiana Pacers basketball player raffled off his 2010 LA Lakers Championship Ring.\n\nCommunity Health Network is Indiana’s largest provider of school-based behavioral health programs, currently delivering care in 52 schools and treating more than 2,000 students annually. Following an application and interview process, Community was awarded this donation to expand its services to help 14 additional children.\n\nCommunity’s school-based behavioral health programs are a partnership with Indianapolis Public Schools and the Metropolitan School Districts of both Lawrence and Warren Townships. Child psychiatrists, nurses, therapists and specialists provide on-site assessment and diagnosis, treatment plans, crisis intervention, therapy, and other programs to students with behavioral health needs.\n\nJoan Reed, the operations director for Community’s school-based behavioral health programs, attended the press conference and said the donation will fulfill a growing need to treat more students with limited family resources.\n\n“Roughly 90 percent of the students we treat qualify for Medicaid, and many students come from families with no health care insurance,” Reed said. “Donations like this one allow us to continue offering treatment to everyone, and to expand our network of behavioral health support.”\n\nOther health care providers benefiting from the donation include:\n\nSteinway Child and Family Services, Queens, NY\n\nChild Center of New York, Woodside, NY\n\nCenters for Youth and Families, Little Rock, AR\n\nCleveland Christian Home, Cleveland, OH\n\nCenterstone of Central Tennessee, Nashville, TN\n\nFamilies Reaching for Rainbows, Indianapolis, IN\n\nReach for Youth, Inc., Indianapolis, IN\n\nWe are grateful for the support Metta World Peace and Xcel University are providing to help us expand our important school-based delivery of care,” said Michele Thomas Dole, Community Health Network Foundation president and CEO. “Today’s investment will benefit 14 children and families, giving them support needed to cope with difficult situations and nurture mental health.”\n\nAbout Community Health Network Foundation\n\nCommunity Health Network Foundation is the not-for-profit philanthropic organization of Community Health Network. Donations support programs and services that benefit patients, families and employees of the network, while ensuring the exceptional experience. The Community Health Network Foundation’s philanthropic efforts, scholarship programs and promotion of health inspire a culture of philanthropy throughout central Indiana.
