        "text": "Just a few days ago Netflix premiered the first episode of Untold, a doc based on the event that took place in late 2004 in a basketball game between the Indiana Pacers and the Detroit Pistons in The infamous-and-now-gone Palace of Auburn Hills, MI. The flick, which I delightfully enjoyed, went flying and felt more like a 10-minute YouTube clip than a 70-minute production. Featuring tons of those involved in the brawl, branded as Malice at the Palace, that was always going to be the case for me personally if only because my heart holds dearly a place in its rooms for the likes of Jermaine, the Wallaces, Cap’n Jack, and most of all, Ron Artest.\n\nBack in 2004, Artest was just another kid. As simple as that. Ron, drafted by the Bulls with a near-lottery pick five years before, had already set foot in both the Windy City and then Indy. Sure thing, he was already an All-Star caliber player getting the nod in time for the ’04 event (the one taking place the season prior to the brawl but on the same calendar year) when he got to play under the brightest of lights in Los Angeles’ STAPLES Center, dropping a low 7–3–3–1 line in his 17 minutes of playing time off the pine. Artest even had the audacity to attempt a three-pointer while at it among his total five shots on the day. Ah, just forgot to mention it: Artest was an age-24 kid by then.\n\nIn Artest’s own words, the day he was traded to Indiana he just didn’t give a fuck about the situation, disobeyed the orders from Bulls’ staffers and hit Chicago’s gym to practice for an hour even with the FO members telling him to get off the court. An injury right there, and I don’t even want to know how stupidly bad that front office would have looked, of course, the trade getting nixed. But that could never happen. That could never happen to Ron because he was spending that time in his own particular Heaven experiencing his own particular Nirvana. It’s the thing that kept him going, focused on the task at hand, improving and developing as a human — if barely — on top of a basketball player.\n\nYou might like Artest more, or you might like Artest less than I do. I can only safely say that I know for sure that Artest was one of the best at his job, and better at it than I would probably ever be at mine. In fact, I don’t even know if I have a true job these days, let alone excelling at it. But those are definitely hard facts. You don’t snatch a DPOY award if you aren’t a top-notch dog. A fierce competitor. A non-nonsense worker willing to “die [on the court]”, as Artest himself laid it.\n\nIt’s funny that Reggie Miller popped on the screen saying that “every team needs a Ron Artest”, because “you need a guy that everyone’s a little bit afraid of”. Literally, everyone including the very own Ron was afraid of Artest, the man and/or the mind depending on the case.\n\nHad Artest took on his hard-working ways to, say, perfecting his shooting prowess, could we have witnessed a 30-point averager for 10 years? What if he had just decided to find teammates and hand them dimes on every play? Could Artest have turned into one of the best early-big-man passers in the L? Interestingly enough, he put all of his will into becoming a defensive force and blocking foes from performing instead of overperforming them on the counting side of sheets.\n\nGetting back to the doc, and just 20 minutes in, Artest deals with his personal situation by opening to the audience with a series of statements. During the screen time that sequence takes, I could clearly recognize Artest in myself, or myself in Artest. Ron’s words hit home hard. If you have not watched, here they are.\n\nThe next year, I knew something was definitely wrong […] and that I just needed to step back. I said, “I want my retirement papers.” And the Pacers said, “ No, you gotta play. You’re under contract six more years.”\n\nOutrageous from both sides.\n\nThe NBA is a multi-billion-dollar professional basketball league. It’s been around since 1949 when it got established for the first time with the merge of the BAA and the NBL into a single competition. It’s been 72 years since the Association’s run started. It’d already been more than 50 between that moment and what was to take place one month into the 2004 season, which will involve two squads and a mentally struggling man by extension. The NBA is also, perhaps, not the best of professional working environments for someone to just quit it midseason given the implications and the bold money the whole structure moves and generates. We can all agree. 1–0 for the L. The NBA is also, like society (on the basis of a generalization) back in 2004, a league that has taken decades to accept the importance of mental issues taking place inside the minds of the athletes that build its roster, and to embrace and help them — pretty much not what the Pacers said to Ron when he presented them with his retirement pitch. 1–1, point (and slight edge ahead) Artest.\n\nImagine getting anxious about what could happen the next minute, only to be told that you will be enduring such a stressful situation for the next six years. At least, when facing next-minute anxiety, one can find hope in not knowing what will be ahead after those sixty seconds elapse. Maybe, just maybe, light strikes, the sun comes up, and everything is fine and calm reigns again. Having to think six years in advance and without an exit at sight, let me tell you, makes me anxious only by thinking about it. Ron, I assume, was waired my way.\n\nSo Artest built a wall between him and the media and the rest of the folks around him and those watching from home. He called himself a “grown man” when they asked him about his decisions to leave the game and work on the music industry — Artest was expected to release a hip-hop album on Nov. 23rd, 2004. Yes, that is in the middle of an ongoing NBA season, but Artest felt he needed the time and focus to be fully invested in that joint and not his hoops career during that span. Artest insisted he’d “make sure all of [his] time is focused on winning the championship” after the album came out. Folks just didn’t buy it.\n\nI have to say, and I have no problem accepting it, that Artest did — or at least attempted to do — something that I have not spent any time doing yet. I know I should, the same as Artest knew something was wrong with him. Artest went hunting for the answer his mind must have stored somewhere inside of it. I just haven’t for one reason or another; I just have not tried to unearth the answers Artest sought.\n\nWhy are you not happy? Figure it out, figure it out. I had depression, and anxiety. I would be depressed about certain things and have anxiety about future things. Some people have control over their emoints. I don’t.\n\nIt’s selfish of me to compare my situation, whatever that is, with Ron’s. The pressure these athletes are constantly put under is nothing compared to the one I could have experienced when, like Artest, I presented my “retirement letter” from Academia a couple of years ago to my superior to turn into full-time freelancing — all of this, coincidentally, happening the very exact day of my birthday. I was ditching a degree in Computer Sciences, a Master of Science in Artificial Intelligence, and a halfway-there Ph.D. in Sports Data and Visualization. My resume will always be home for those accolades, and my knowledge of those fields will — for some time, I hope — stay there the same as Ron Artest’s Basketball-Reference.com profile page would have always stored and shown his early tenure in the NBA had he opted to quit it for good that fall.\n\nThe family-member death/Source Awards episode shown next in the doc stroke me as a sign of mental health issues — and by that I’m not calling anyone crazy as the media and Artest’s very own teammates would, but rather pointing toward a crystal-clear moment in which Ron let his weaknesses out, voluntarily or not — when Ron stepped to the podium in Miami and let the crowd know “[he didn’t] know what [he was] doing up [there]. It’s all good, though.”\n\nCut to the next clip in the doc, Artest back sitting on a couch, just making clear what I and probably everyone watching got from the prior scene.\n\nI felt I was trying to escape. I was trying to find any way to escape. Definitely.\n\nRon Artest, he of 24 years of age then, remember, was just fighting his way through his daily struggles. It’s not hard to grasp. Shouldn’t have been hard to see by those right there in the place and time next to him. Waking up depressed because he felt he had a bad game yesterday? Hit the gym, practice for three hours, keep the mind busy, let the run clock, carry on. Feeling anxious because of the upcoming match scheduled for tomorrow? Go drop some sweat attempting some shots on the hardwood alone, or just go with your feelings and needs-of-the-moment and focus entirely on producing a rap album whether that makes sense to those around you or not. Whatever keeps you going. Whatever helps you forget about your issues, or perhaps more appropriately, whatever turns your mind blank for a while and leaves it in an empty, comatose state that kills the pain.\n\nThat’s nothing new to me. Where some saw a man that couldn’t get his shit together, I see a man trying to find his way by any means necessary and fighting to live another day. Artest turned to honing his basketball skillset like a madman. I opted to put words together in columns no one would most probably ever read, or just doodle stuff to potentially-yet-not-realistically hang on folks’ walls or print on discounted, already-cheap hoodies that don’t even land me peanuts.\n\nThis whole story comes from the five-to-six minutes in which Artest tells his truth in the doc, the one I just described from my point of view and optics. If those 300 seconds of footage are not the most powerful and enlightening thing I have watched in the past couple of years, they must be as close as it gets to it. I might be biased because I have always been endeared to Artest, the basketball player. I really didn’t know a lot of the facts that built his character throughout the years— by that, I mean out-of-context facts, such as him seeking an early retirement or putting together a rap album, without getting into the true reasons hidden behind those acts— or had a real interest in the personal, human, and sociocultural side of the game back in 2010 when then-Metta World Peace lifted the Larry O’B as part of a legendary Lakers squad featuring the likes of Pau Gasol and the late Kobe Bryant. I was just a foolish 18-year-old youngster myself living comfortably and not giving a damn about virtually anything around me.\n\nI couldn't care less about mental health. Talk about a funny arc, the one drawing my life…\n\nI’m writing this five years after Metta World Peace — these days going by the name of Metta Sandiford-Artest — hung his jersey for good after completing an 18-year pro career that included a short year-long, split-stint in China and Italy, and 17 seasons of NBA ball. When Metta got the chip back in 2010, helping the Lake Show in overcoming the Celtics and playing an absolutely crucial role in the Game 7 title-clincher, he shouted out to his psychologist Dr. Santhi Periasamy right after the final buzzer while opening his soul for the world to finally peep inside of it.\n\nOf course, most fans and media alike still found a way to double-down on the ridiculously naive, heartless, and profoundly stupid “Artest: crazy man by nature” takes. Fast-forward 10 years and you’ll find a great percentage of the basketball population has come to terms and accepted Young Ron’s troubles and mental issues as something serious, something with real implications, something that can eat a human from inside out.\n\nI want to salute Metta Sandiford-Artest from this small corner of the internet. He won’t be reading these words — I can only hope somehow he does, but let’s be honest and not fall into utopian, impossible-to-achieve accomplishments. Salute to the man that beat the odds. Salute to the basketball player whose abilities evolved non-stop, who came to dominate not only the game we care about but who did so while fighting his own demons."
