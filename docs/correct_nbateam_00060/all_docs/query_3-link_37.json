        "text": "Call him “The Pandas Friend.”\n\nMetta World Peace, the pugnacious basketball player formerly known as Ron Artest, is undergoing yet another reincarnation.\n\nAfter signing a one-year, $1.4 million deal to play with the Chinese Basketball Association’s Sichuan Blue Whales last week, the 6-foot-7 former National Basketball Association star forward confirmed via his Twitter account that he was marking the occasion by exchanging his Buddhist-inspired name for one that celebrates the animal most associated with his new team’s home province.\n\nSoon after his new Chinese moniker — 熊猫之友 (xiongmao zhiyou) — was revealed by the Chinese news media, Mr. World Peace, 34, took to his social media accounts to set the record straight on its English translation:\n\nWhile it is unclear whether he plans to make the name change legal, Mr. World Peace appears to have wholeheartedly embraced his new identity. Although his official website name and his Twitter and Sina Weibo handles remain unchanged, in the days since the announcement, Mr. World Peace has let loose a barrage of panda-related messages on his Twitter and Sina Weibo accounts, including several photos of his face superimposed on the body of a panda.\n\nIn the early hours of Monday on the West Coast, in simultaneous posts on his Twitter and Sina Weibo accounts, he wrote: “Got caught in the rain in Vegas!!! Oh boy!!!” Six minutes later, he followed up with a photo of a panda in the rain accompanied by the caption “So cold.”\n\nWhile his first name change in 2011 was intended to be a call to “inspire and bring youth together all around the world,” Mr. World Peace’s latest rechristening appears to be geared at least in part toward generating buzz for his debut with the Sichuan team this fall.\n\nAs of Monday, that tactic appeared to be working. On Sina Weibo, many Chinese have weighed in on the news of the imminent arrival of “The Pandas Friend.”\n\nWhile most comments have puzzled over how to translate his new name, many have also voiced concerns about Mr. World Peace’s hotheaded reputation.\n\n“Does the name mean that black eyes will be given to all the players?” asked one commenter, in what appeared to be an oblique reference to a major brawl during a 2004 Detroit Pistons and Indiana Pacers game in which Mr. World Peace, then still known as Mr. Artest, leaped into the stands and exchanged punches with spectators after one threw a drink at him.\n\nAccording to Mr. World Peace’s Twitter message, he will be in China for four months. It is unclear if this would conflict with his other reported job, as an assistant coach for a Los Angeles high school girls’ basketball team, which was announced earlier this summer.\n\nIn signing with the Sichuan Blue Whales, Mr. World Peace, who last played for the New York Knicks before he was waived in February, is the latest in a series of former N.B.A. players to join the Chinese Basketball Association.\n\nThe most successful of these has arguably been the former N.B.A. point guard Stephon Marbury. Since joining the C.B.A. in 2010, Mr. Marbury, or “Ma Bu Li” as he is known in China, has endeared himself to his Chinese fans by not just leading his current team, the Beijing Ducks, to two C.B.A. championships, but also by fully immersing himself in local culture by, for example, taking the subway and learning Mandarin.\n\nThe Sichuan Blue Whales might be hoping for a similar lift from Mr. World Peace. The team finished the 2013-14 season, its first in the C.B.A., ranked 12th in the 18-team circuit. It had an overall losing record, winning 14 games and losing 20."
