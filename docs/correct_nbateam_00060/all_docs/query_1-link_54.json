        "text": "INDIANAPOLIS (WISH) — Indiana Pacers guard Tyrese Haliburton has been named to the All-NBA Third Team.\n\nHaliburton is the sixth player in franchise history to be selected to an All-NBA Team, joining Reggie Miller, Jermaine O’Neal, Paul George, Victor Oladipo, and Metta World Peace.\n\nThe All-Star guard guided Indiana to a 47-35 record during the regular season and averaged 20.1 points, 3.9 rebounds, and led the league with a career-best 10.9 assists per game. He also set a Pacers franchise record with 752 assists.\n\nHaliburton also set two NBA records during the 2023-24 season. He became the first player in league history to record multiple games with 25+ points, 15+ assists, and zero turnovers, and he did so in back-to-back games at Philadelphia on Nov. 12 and 15.\n\nHe’s also the only player in NBA history to ever record three career games with 20+ points, 17+ assists, and zero turnovers, all of which happened this season.\n\nHaliburton’s success has continued into the postseason. He led the Pacers to their first Eastern Conference Finals appearance in a decade, averaging 19.3 points, 4.9 rebounds, and 8.2 assists per game during the playoffs.\n\nGame 2 of the Eastern Conference Finals series against the Boston Celtics is Thursday at 8 p.m. The series will return to Indianapolis for Games 3 and 4.\n\nRelated Coverage"
