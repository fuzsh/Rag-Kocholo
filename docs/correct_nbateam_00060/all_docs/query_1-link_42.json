        "text": "I remember I came into the NBA in 1999, the game was a little bit more rough. The game now is more for kids. It's not really a man's game anymore. The parents are really protective of their children. They cry to their AAU coaches. They cry to the refs, \"That's a foul. That's a foul.\"\n\nSometimes I wish those parents would just stay home, don't come to the game, and now translated, these same AAU kids whose parents came to the game, 'That's a foul.' These kids are in the NBA. So now we have a problem. You've got a bunch of babies professionally around the world.\n\nIt's no longer a man's game. It's a baby's game. There's softies everywhere. Everybody's soft. Nobody's hard no more. So, you just deal with it, you adjust and that's it.\n\nGood teams are playing faster, moving the ball well, and playing beautiful basketball now. But sure, what we miss is a dragged down, game where you can just grab/clutch/hack your opponents with impunity on the way to the rim. That was sure fun to watch. Maybe we should return to the 1940s and 50s when professional basketball more closely resembled football in the paint?\n\nDonâ€™t be your grandparents, people. Embrace the modern game.\n\nI think he'd be great in the locker room with young players, but we have to be careful not to use a roster spot too early because we have a lot of young kids ... that we're going to bring to camp. We don't want to put ourselves in a bind by getting 15 roster spots taken and not giving the young kids, who could be very talented, a chance to make the team. That's something that we're going to have to weigh."
