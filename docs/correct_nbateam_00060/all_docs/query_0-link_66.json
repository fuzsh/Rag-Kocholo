        "text": "\"Ron Artest\" redirects here. For his son, also a basketball player, see Ron Artest III.\n\nMetta Sandiford-Artest (born Ronald William Artest Jr.; November 13, 1979), previously legally named Metta World Peace, is an American former professional basketball player who played 19 seasons in the National Basketball Association (NBA). Under the name Ron Artest, he played college basketball for the St. John's Red Storm. He was drafted by the Chicago Bulls in the first round of the 1999 NBA draft.\n\nIn 2001, he signed with the Indiana Pacers, where he won the NBA Defensive Player of the Year Award and was also named an NBA All-Star in 2004. Later that year, he was involved in a fight between the Pacers and the Detroit Pistons, and was suspended for the remainder of the 2004–05 season. Weeks after the start of the 2005–06 season, he was traded to the Sacramento Kings, and spent the 2008–09 season with the Houston Rockets. In 2009, he signed with the Los Angeles Lakers, and helped the team win the NBA championship in 2010.\n\nIn 2011, Artest legally changed his name to Metta World Peace, and continued to play with the Lakers until 2013, when he signed with the New York Knicks. After a year of hiatus from the NBA, he returned to the Lakers for his final seasons in 2015 before retiring in 2017. In 2020, he changed his name to Metta Sandiford-Artest.\n\nEarly life\n\nMetta Sandiford-Artest was born Ronald William Artest Jr. on November 13, 1979, and raised in the Queensbridge projects in Long Island City, Queens, New York. He has two younger brothers, Isaiah and Daniel. He played high school basketball at La Salle Academy. He also teamed with future NBA players Elton Brand and Lamar Odom on the same Amateur Athletic Union (AAU) team.\n\nCollege career\n\nArtest played college basketball at St. John's University from 1997 to 1999. At St. John's, he majored in mathematics. In 1999, he led the Red Storm to a 14-4 record in the Big East Conference and 28-9 overall and the Elite Eight of the NCAA Division I Tournament, losing to Ohio State.\n\nArtest gained fame playing around New York City in some of its high-profile summer basketball tournaments—Nike Pro City in Manhattan, Hoops in the Sun Tournament at Orchard Beach in The Bronx, and The Dyckman Basketball Tournament at Dyckman Park in Washington Heights—earning himself nicknames such as Tru Warier and The New World Order, with the latter name received from Randy Cruz who is a co-founder of Hoops in the Sun basketball league.\n\nProfessional career\n\nChicago Bulls (1999–2002)\n\nArtest was selected by the Chicago Bulls with the 16th pick of the 1999 NBA draft.\n\nArtest played a total of 175 games for the Bulls over 2+1⁄2 years, the bulk as a starter, during which time he averaged about 12.5 points and just over four rebounds per game. He was named to the NBA All-Rookie Second Team in the 1999–2000 season.\n\nIndiana Pacers (2002–2006)\n\nMidway through the 2001–02 season, Artest was traded by Chicago to the Indiana Pacers along with Ron Mercer, Brad Miller, and Kevin Ollie, for Jalen Rose, Travis Best, Norman Richardson, and a second-round draft pick. On January 27, 2003, Artest got into a verbal altercation with Miami Heat head coach Pat Riley and was suspended for four games. During the 2003–04 season with the Pacers, he averaged 18.3 points per game, 5.7 rebounds per game, and 3.7 assists per game. Artest made the 2004 NBA All-Star Game as a reserve and was named the Defensive Player of the Year. He wore three jersey numbers for the Pacers: 15, 23, and 91.\n\nThe Malice at the Palace\n\nMain article: Malice at the Palace\n\nOn November 19, 2004, Artest was at the center of an altercation among players and fans during a game in Auburn Hills, Michigan, between Artest's Pacers and the home team Detroit Pistons. The brawl involved Artest, Pistons center Ben Wallace, Artest's teammates Jermaine O'Neal and Stephen Jackson, several other players, and spectators including Pistons fans John Green and A.J. Shackleford.\n\nThe fight resulted in the game being stopped with less than a minute remaining. O'Neal, Jackson, and Wallace were suspended indefinitely the day after the game. A day later, the NBA suspended Artest for the rest of the regular season, plus any playoff games. Artest missed 86 games, the longest suspension for an on-court incident in NBA history.\n\nAftermath and trade\n\nAfter playing 16 games early in the 2005–06 season, Artest demanded a trade from the Indiana Pacers, and he was placed on the team's inactive roster. Artest's call for a trade created a rift between him and his teammates. \"We felt betrayed, a little disrespected,\" teammate Jermaine O'Neal said. As for their basketball relationship, O'Neal added: \"The business relationship is over. That's fact.\" Pacers president Larry Bird said he also felt \"betrayed\" and \"disappointed.\"\n\nOn January 24, 2006, reports from NBA sources confirmed that the Sacramento Kings had agreed to trade Peja Stojaković to the Pacers for Artest. However, before the trade could be completed, many press outlets reported that Artest had informed team management that he did not want to go to the Kings. According to Artest's agent, his original trade request was only made because he was upset when he heard rumors that the Pacers were going to trade him to the Kings for Stojaković early in the season. While not denying his agent's story, Artest did deny that he had rejected the trade to Sacramento, saying that he would play anywhere; hence, contradicting earlier press accounts stating Artest was holding up the trade. Given conflicting accounts, it is unclear why the trade was delayed, but it was nonetheless completed on January 25 and Artest was officially sent to the Kings for Stojaković.\n\nSacramento Kings (2006–2008)\n\nThough traded midseason to the Kings franchise, Artest quickly found his place on the team by providing some much-needed defense. Though many feared his abrasive personality would be a problem, he worked well with his teammates and then-coach Rick Adelman. Artest wore #93 for his jersey number with the Kings. After acquiring Artest in late January 2006, the team immediately went on a 14–5 run, the team's best run of the season. The Kings broke .500 and landed the eighth spot in the Western Conference. This prompted ESPN to declare that \"Ron Artest has breathed new life in the Sacramento Kings and enhanced their chances of reaching the playoffs for the ninth straight year.\" Fox Sports proclaimed, \"Artest has Kings back in playoff hunt.\"\n\nHe was suspended for Game 2 of the team's first-round series against the San Antonio Spurs following a flagrant foul (elbow to the head) on Manu Ginóbili. The Kings eventually were eliminated from the playoffs in six games.\n\nAfter the playoffs, Artest offered to donate his entire salary to keep teammate Bonzi Wells with the team, who became a free agent after the 2005–06 NBA season. Wells was later picked up by the Houston Rockets and then traded to the New Orleans Hornets for former Sacramento Kings player Bobby Jackson. Artest also offered to donate his salary to retain the services of head coach Rick Adelman, whose contract expired after the same season. Adelman and the Kings did not agree on a contract extension so the two parted ways.\n\nHouston Rockets (2008–2009)\n\nOn July 29, 2008, it was reported that Artest was to be traded to the Houston Rockets along with Patrick Ewing Jr. and Sean Singletary for Bobby Jackson, recently drafted forward Donté Greene, a 2009 first-round draft pick, and cash considerations. The deal was made official on August 14, due to Greene's rookie contract signing on July 14. In response to the trade, Yao Ming was generally positive, but jokingly expressed hope that Artest is \"not fighting anymore and going after a guy in the stands.\" In response, Artest said, \"This is Tracy (McGrady) and Yao's team, you know. I'm not going to take it personal. I understand what Yao said, but I'm still ghetto. That's not going to change. I'm never going to change my culture. Yao has played with a lot of black players, but I don't think he's ever played with a black player that really represents his culture as much as I represent my culture.\"\n\nArtest and Yao later exchanged extensive phone calls. Artest also said, \"Whatever Adelman needs me to do, whether that's come off the bench, sixth, seventh man, start, I don't even care. Whatever he needs me to do, I'm 100 percent sure it's going to work out.\"\n\nOn October 30, 2008, Artest received his first technical as a Houston Rocket, as he raced towards a group of Dallas Mavericks players and then quickly went to Yao Ming who bumped Josh Howard after play stopped. Artest was trying to pull Yao away from the play and to the foul line, but contact was made with Maverick players. The TNT broadcast crew felt that this technical was unwarranted and reckoned it was based upon Artest's prior reputation as a feisty player in the league. In the playoffs, Artest helped the Rockets advance past the first round for the first time in 12 seasons. In Game 2 of the second round against the Los Angeles Lakers, Artest, who was battling for rebounding position with Kobe Bryant, was elbowed in the neck by Bryant, which was later ruled to be a Type 1 flagrant foul. After being called for an offensive foul, Artest was indignant and proceeded to antagonize Bryant after the play, which eventually led to an ejection by Joe Crawford. In Game 3, Artest was again ejected in the fourth quarter after a hard foul on Pau Gasol, who was attempting to dunk on a fast-break. It was determined the next day that the foul was not serious enough to warrant an ejection, and the flagrant foul was downgraded.\n\nLos Angeles Lakers (2009–2013)\n\n2009–11: Championship season\n\nIn July 2009, the Los Angeles Lakers signed Artest to a five-year deal worth about $33 million. Artest chose the number 37 jersey, which he said was in honor of Michael Jackson. Jackson's Thriller album was at No. 1 on the charts for 37 straight weeks.\n\nIn Game 5 of the 2010 Western Conference Finals, Artest hit a game-winning shot at the buzzer after grabbing a last second offensive rebound. He scored 25 points against the Phoenix Suns in Game 6 and went to the NBA Finals for the first time in his career. In the finals, the Lakers defeated the Boston Celtics, four games to three. Artest scored 20 points in the clincher and sank the team's last field goal – a three-pointer late in the fourth quarter – to virtually seal the victory. Afterwards, Lakers head coach Phil Jackson called Artest the most valuable player of Game 7 against the Celtics. He won his first championship ring with the Lakers.\n\nFor the 2010–11 season, Artest switched back to number 15, his college number at St. John's and the first number he wore in his NBA career.\n\nOn April 26, 2011, Artest won the NBA's J. Walter Kennedy Citizenship Award.\n\n2011–13: Controversy and injury-riddled season\n\nArtest changed his name to Metta World Peace during the offseason. He came into training camp for the 2011–12 season out of shape. Consequently, new Lakers coach Mike Brown moved World Peace to a reserve role with reduced playing time. World Peace lamented that Brown's coaching style placed too much emphasis on statistics.\n\nOn April 22, 2012, in a game against the Oklahoma City Thunder, World Peace elbowed James Harden in the head as he was celebrating a dunk. He received a flagrant foul 2 and was immediately ejected. Harden was later found to have suffered a concussion. After the game, World Peace apologized and stated that the elbow was \"unintentional.\" On April 24, 2012, World Peace was suspended for seven games, meaning he would miss the Lakers' season finale game against the Sacramento Kings as well as the first few games of the playoffs.\n\nAfter a 1–4 start to the 2012–13 season, the Lakers fired Brown as head coach and hired Mike D'Antoni. On December 18, 2012, in a win against the Philadelphia 76ers, he grabbed a career-high 16 rebounds to add to his 19 points. On January 11, 2013, he suffered a right leg injury against the Thunder that would hamper him for two months. Around the same time, he also had an injury to his right arm that made it difficult to bend. His health worsened to the point where D'Antoni moved him off the perimeter on defense and had him guard power forwards instead. By mid-March, he was able to guard the perimeter again. On March 25, against the Golden State Warriors, World Peace tore the lateral meniscus in his left knee. He underwent surgery that was originally estimated to sideline him for six weeks. Despite the estimates, he returned 12 days after his surgery. In his absence, D'Antoni was using a reduced seven-man rotation with Kobe Bryant playing close to all 48 minutes each game. World Peace wanted to reduce his teammates' workload, if even for a few minutes, as the Lakers fought to qualify for the playoffs. The Lakers qualified for the playoffs as the seventh seed, but were swept 4–0 by San Antonio in the first round. Due to the Lakers' other injuries, World Peace played in Game 3 in spite of running with discomfort after having fluid drained from a cyst behind his surgically repaired left knee. He missed the final game of the series, and later admitted he came back too soon. For the season, he averaged his most points (12.4) since 2008–09, and shot his highest percentage (.404) since 2009–10. Still, ESPN wrote those numbers indicated that \"the 33-year-old is clearly on the decline.\"\n\nOn July 11, 2013, after four seasons with the Lakers, the team waived World Peace via the amnesty clause to gain relief from the salary cap.\n\nNew York Knicks (2013–2014)\n\nOn July 16, 2013, World Peace signed a two-year deal with his hometown team the New York Knicks. On February 24, 2014, he was waived by the Knicks after they bought out his contract.\n\nSichuan Blue Whales (2014)\n\nOn August 4, 2014, World Peace signed with the Sichuan Blue Whales of the Chinese Basketball Association. Due to a recurrent knee injury, he was replaced on the roster in December 2014 with Daniel Orton. In 15 games, World Peace averaged 19 points, 6 rebounds and 2.3 steals per game.\n\nPallacanestro Cantù (2015)\n\nOn March 24, 2015, World Peace signed with Pallacanestro Cantù of Italy for the rest of the 2014–15 Lega Basket Serie A season. On May 27, 2015, in Cantù's Game 5 quarter-final loss to Reyer Venezia Mestre which ended their season, World Peace was ejected from the game and charged with five fouls after getting involved in a skirmish during the fourth quarter. In July 2015, he parted ways with the club after the two parties could not come to a new contract agreement.\n\nReturn to the Lakers (2015–2017)\n\nOn September 24, 2015, World Peace signed with the Los Angeles Lakers, returning to the franchise for a second stint. On November 6, 2015, he made his season debut in a 104–98 win over the Brooklyn Nets, playing 17 minutes with a plus-minus of 12. Teammate Kobe Bryant praised him for his impact on \"everybody on the floor defensively.\"\n\nOn September 21, 2016, World Peace re-signed with the Lakers. On April 11, 2017, World Peace scored a team-leading 18 points in the second half to help the Lakers extend its longest winning streak in four years to five games with a 108–96 victory over the New Orleans Pelicans. He had the ball in his hands with the crowd on its feet for the Lakers' final possession in what was potentially his final game at Staples Center. During the game, he got his 1,716th and 1,717th career steals to move past Ron Harper for 22nd place in NBA history.\n\nNew Orleans Gators (2017)\n\nDuring the offseason, World Peace played with the New Orleans Gators of the Global Mixed Gender Basketball (GMGB) League.\n\nSan Diego Kings (2019)\n\nIn 2019, World Peace signed a one-day contract with the San Diego Kings of American Basketball Association to bolster their squad against the four-time defending league champion Jacksonville Giants.\n\nCoaching career\n\nWorld Peace was a player development coach in 2017–18 for the South Bay Lakers, the Los Angeles Lakers' development-league team in the G League. During the offseason in 2018, he played 3x3 basketball with the BIG3. He played under the name Ron Artest at the request of league co-founder Ice Cube, who wanted to \"turn back the clock a little bit.\"\n\nNBA career statistics\n\nLegend GP Games played GS Games started MPG Minutes per game FG% Field goal percentage 3P% 3-point field goal percentage FT% Free throw percentage RPG Rebounds per game APG Assists per game SPG Steals per game BPG Blocks per game PPG Points per game Bold Career high\n\nRegular season\n\nYear Team GP GS MPG FG% 3P% FT% RPG APG SPG BPG PPG 1999–00 Chicago 72 63 31.1 .407 .314 .674 4.3 2.8 1.7 .5 12.0 2000–01 Chicago 76 74 31.1 .401 .291 .750 3.9 3.0 2.0 .6 11.9 2001–02 Chicago 27 26 30.5 .433 .396 .628 4.9 2.9 2.8 .9 15.6 2001–02 Indiana 28 24 29.3 .411 .215 .733 5.0 1.8 2.4 .6 10.9 2002–03 Indiana 69 67 33.6 .428 .336 .736 5.2 2.9 2.3 .7 15.5 2003–04 Indiana 73 71 37.2 .421 .310 .733 5.3 3.7 2.1 .7 18.3 2004–05 Indiana 7 7 41.6 .496 .412 .922 6.4 3.1 1.7 .9 24.6 2005–06 Indiana 16 16 37.7 .460 .333 .612 4.9 2.2 2.6 .7 19.4 2005–06 Sacramento 40 40 40.1 .383 .302 .717 5.2 4.2 2.0 .8 16.9 2006–07 Sacramento 70 65 37.7 .440 .358 .740 6.5 3.4 2.1 .6 18.8 2007–08 Sacramento 57 54 38.1 .453 .380 .719 5.8 3.5 2.3 .7 20.5 2008–09 Houston 69 55 35.5 .401 .399 .748 5.2 3.3 1.5 .3 17.1 2009–10† L.A.

Artest made a surprise appearance at the exhibition's opening night, commenting that \"(the show) was definitely special. It was unexpected. Overwhelming.\"\n\nArtest was part of the line-up for the thirteenth season of the reality show Dancing with the Stars, though he finished in last place, being eliminated in the show's first week.\n\nIn October 2012, he appeared as a panelist on Nickelodeon's game show Figure It Out.\n\nIn September 2013, he made the first in a recurring series of skits on the Comedy Central sketch show Key and Peele called \"Metta World News,\" in which he plays a newscaster.\n\nPeace competed against actor Skylar Astin in an episode of Spike's Lip Sync Battle that aired June 21, 2017. He performed Cypress Hill's \"Insane in the Brain\" and Katy Perry's \"Roar\" but did not win.\n\nIn January 2018, it was announced that World Peace was a contestant in the first American edition of Celebrity Big Brother. Metta became the fourth celebrity to be evicted from the house on Day 20. He also appeared in the second season as part of a Head of Household competition.\n\nIn 2023, Metta World Peace competed in season ten of The Masked Singer as the wild card contestant \"Cuddle Monster\" who Nick Cannon called the largest costume in this series. He was eliminated on \"Trolls Night\".\n\nArtest Media Group\n\nWorld Peace is the founder of the Artest Media Group. Established in 2010, the brand management company's clients include himself and music artists Vinita, Deacon, Sade Artest, Rugby, and Emmaline Cleary. Music producers Wip, Q, and Lucky are also associated with the group. On February 19, 2013, World Peace was awoken by a squad of police who received a tip there had been gun play within his property. Authorities were quick to recognize their mistake after World Peace explained that the armed individuals were actors shooting a \"life on the streets\"-styled movie for his group.\n\nDiscography\n\nOn October 31, 2006, Artest released a rap album entitled My World. He published the album on the Lightyear Records label under his own imprint, Tru Warier Records. The album features guest artists P. Diddy, Juvenile, Mike Jones, Big Kap, Nature and Capone.\n\nAdvocacy\n\nHe has become involved in advocacy relating to mental health issues. In December 2010, he announced that he would donate some or all of his salary for the 2011–12 NBA season toward mental health awareness charities. Artest also auctioned off his 2009–10 championship ring and donated the proceeds to various mental health charities nationwide. In 2016, he told Sports Illustrated, \"Some people don't understand mental health is broad. You have to ask questions. Are you depressed? Are you schizophrenic? Do you have anxiety? Are you bipolar? Those are the different things that come under the banner of mental health.\"\n\nHe has posed for PETA ad campaigns encouraging people to report animal abuse and to have their pets neutered.\n\nOn March 26, 2024, Metta World Peace participated in an event hosted by Robert F.
