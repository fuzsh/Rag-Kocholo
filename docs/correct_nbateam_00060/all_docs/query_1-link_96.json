        "text": "The trailer for Netflix’s sports documentary series “Untold” has been released ahead of the August 10 premier and it includes footage from the episode about the infamous “Malice at the Palace.” The trailer shows former Indiana Pacers players including Metta Sandiford-Artest -- who was previously known as Ron Artest -- Jermaine O’Neal and more discussing the incident.\n\nArtest opens the trailer by admitting he had trouble controlling his emotions at the time of the brawl, before he says he wants to talk about the incident.\n\n“I want the story out there. Like, what happened? Go frame-by-frame,” Artest says during the trailer.\n\nThe “Malice at the Palace” episode is one of five different 80-minutes documentaries being released as part of the series. The other four focus on Caitlyn Jenner and other sports personalities at the center of controversial or life changing moments.\n\n“We chose these stories by asking ourselves this question: ‘Is this the single most important thing that happened in this person’s life?’” said directors and co-executive producers Chapman Way and Maclain Way in a statement. “What we’ve found doing documentaries is if you’re sitting down with someone and the event that you are interviewing them about was the most pivotal and important thing that happened to them, you are going to walk away with really fascinating insights into their lives, that have a sense of a narrative built in — a beginning, middle and end.”\n\nArtest was the central figure in the brawl, but was hardly the only one involved in the matter. The incident started at the end of a game between the Detroit Pistons and the Indiana Pacers on Nov. 19, 2004.\n\nIt started when a fan threw a cup at Artest, hitting him in the chest and face. Artest reacted by running into the stands and getting physical with the fan he thought threw the cup. However, the fan Artest fought with was not the man who threw the cup and years later, Artest said he discovered the fan that actually threw it did so after his friend bet him $50 he couldn’t hit the NBA star.\n\nFans who were in attendance have also shared their version of events from that night.\n\nMultiple players from the Pacers ended up fighting fans in one of the more chaotic moments in American sports. Artest was suspended for the entire season and missed the playoffs as well following the fight.\n\nSeveral Pistons players were also suspended for their roles in the brawl. It is unknown which if any Pistons players took part in the documentary.\n\n“The Malice at the Palace” episode is set to premier on August 10.\n\nREAD MORE:\n\nNBA prospect Cade Cunningham: ‘Detroit fits me,’ and why he loves the city\n\nDetroit Pistons reportedly add Andrew Jones III as assistant coach to staff"
