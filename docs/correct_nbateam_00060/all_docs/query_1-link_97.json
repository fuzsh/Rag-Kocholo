        "text": "In Indianapolis, World Peace is still known as Ron, and on Tuesday the 36-year-old, now in his 17th season, made what will likely be his final visit as an NBA player, a 115-108 loss for his Los Angeles Lakers at Bankers Life Fieldhouse. World Peace played 2 minutes, 36 seconds and scored two points, both from the free throw line.\n\nEven if World Peace’s career moves on, ever closer to his overall goal of playing for 20 seasons, he said he won’t ever recover from how his Pacers tenure ended, especially because he believed so many people in and around the franchise truly liked him, cared for him, tried to help him at every turn, but he didn’t do right by them.\n\n“That’s what I feel most bad about to this day,” World Peace told ESPN. “That’s something that I can never, ever forgive myself for. I don’t regret it, but I definitely can’t forgive myself for that.”"
