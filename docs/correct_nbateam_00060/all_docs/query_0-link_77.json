        "text": "The man formerly known as Ron Artest has had quite the NBA career. Here are some examples of Metta World Peace's outrageous behavior throughout his career with the Bulls, Pacers, Kings, Rockets and Lakers:\n\nJune 13, 2001: Artest, then with the Bulls, breaks two of Michael Jordan's ribs during a pickup game. At the time, Artest told the Chicago Daily Herald he wasn't sure what happened, saying, “I read it in the paper and was like, “Man, Mike's ribs got broke. How'd his ribs get broke?”\n\n2002-2003 season: Suspended several times, including: Three games for smashing video equipment at Madison Square Garden, four games for confrontation with Pat Riley and one game for smashing a framed picture of himself at Conseco Fieldhouse. Also fined $20,000 for making an obsense gesture to the crowd at a game in Cleveland.\n\nJune 1, 2004: Called for flagrant foul for taking a shot at Richard Hamilton's masked face during Game 6 of the Eastern Conference Finals. The Pistons eliminated the Pacers shortly after.\n\nNov. 9-10, 2004: Benched for two games after he asked for time off to promote the release of his rap album.\n\nNov. 19, 2004: Artest is at the center of a brawl with Detroit Pistons fans. He received a 73-game suspension for going into the stands and throwing punches at fans. Artest and teammate Stephen Jackson were sentenced to one year of probation and 60 hours of community service after pleading no contest.\n\n2005-06 season: Requests trade from Pacers and is put on team's inactive roster. He is eventually traded to the Sacramento Kings.\n\nJuly 2009: Artest signs with Lakers, choses the number 37, which he said was in honor of Michael Jackson's Thriller album, which spent 37 weeks at the No. 1 spot on the charts. (He switched back to No. 15 for the 2010-11 season)\n\nDecember 2010: Artest raffles off his Los Angeles Lakers championship ring to boost mental health awareness.\n\nApril 26, 2011: Wins the NBA's J. Walter Kennedy Citizenship Award, given to someone who shows “outstanding service and dedication to the community.”\n\nSept. 16, 2011: Changes name to Metta World Peace. The word “metta” refers to the Buddhist virtue of kindness."
