        "text": "The forward, now retired, believes that the unfortunate fight they had at the Palace of Auburn Hills ended a team that would have been champions\n\nJermaine O'Neal, Reggie Miller, the then Ron Artest... The Indiana Pacers at the beginning of the 2000st century had talent and intensity on the court enough to rub shoulders with the best teams in the NBA. Following the positive line that took them to the 2004 Finals, and knowing how to rebuild while continuing to compete, in XNUMX they were able to reach the Eastern Finals, where they were surpassed by the Detroit Pistons who would end up champions. That was the ceiling of that team that aimed for the highest.\n\nAfter a campaign in which both O'Neal and Artest were All-Stars (the second also Best Defender of the Year), in Indianapolis they felt prepared to assault the first championship in their history. And so they were planted in the 2004-05 season. Before starting, they acquired Stephen Jackson in exchange for Al Harrington, a transfer that fit well into a team that started strong until the fateful November 19, 2004. That day, facing the Pistons in Detroit, a hard foul by Artest on Ben Wallace started a fire that seemed out until a fan threw a glass of beer at the Pacers forward. The result is known to everyone. Artest, Jackson and O'Neal ended up fighting in the stands with fans and were later sanctioned by the NBA; in the case of Artest, for the entire season (including playoffs).\n\nThat's where the history of that team ended. Although they fought to qualify for the postseason, they lost again to Michigan – this time in the conference semifinals. With that expected setback, the retirement of Reggie Miller and an Artest whose head was not very well furnished, what could be one of the memorable moments in Indiana's history came to nothing. The following year, without its legend on the roster, Indiana had to deal with Artest's transfer request, who went so far as to say: \"the team will be better off without me.\" They sent him to Sacramento. He had to rebuild.\n\nNow, 15 years later, and under the name Metta World Peace, the protagonist of that story – both hero and villain – remembers what happened with a bittersweet taste; the one that floods her when she realizes what could have been but wasn't.\n\n«That team was crazy. It was an incredible group, a hell of a team for the rivals. Everyone says we could have won the championship. We definitely could have done it. I regret that one a little bit. I think when I won the ring with the Lakers, I went up to the podium and the first thing I did was thank Donnie Walsh (former Pacers president of basketball operations), Jermaine O'Neal, Al Harrington, Jamaal Tinsley, Steve Jackson, Anthony Johnson. I had to thank them because I knew that we were prepared to win the title,\" he says in an interview with GQ in which he promotes the documentary Quiet storm.\n\nRegretful of not getting what he saw so close, but not so close to that moment that changed his story in Indiana. Questioned about the fight in Detroit, MWP assures that he would react exactly the same. \"The fight? If someone were to throw something at me, I would smash it again. No one is allowed to hit me with anything. Never. Not before that fight either. I wasn't raised like that. Don't throw anything at me because I won't throw anything at anyone either. The fight was a problem between me and a man, that was all. Ben and I wanted to fight, but we couldn't, there were a lot of people in the way. Then another man threw something at me. It was something simple. The only thing that is difficult to deal with at the moment is my awards. I only have eight. If he had had a better career he would have maybe 20 or 25 awards. He was the man from Indiana. He was averaging 25 points. He was 23 years old and I was in my prime,\" he admits.\n\nThere is no lack of reason. Although his career continued to the point of becoming champion with Los Angeles Lakers, his role as the main player of a team was not repeated beyond his time in the Kings, where on only one occasion did he reach the playoffs. Furthermore, his fame began to precede him. They were no longer talking about his talent for playing, but rather about his ability to lose his temper. Could he have had a better career? Sure.\n\n(Photo by Dylan Buell/BIG3/Getty Images)"
